00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,390
Mm. Those are good worms
right there.

3
00:01:13,524 --> 00:01:16,257
Hey, Alex! How's the commute
treating you?

4
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,622
Hey, I can't complain.

5
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:19,458
- That never stopped him before.
- Right?

6
00:01:21,057 --> 00:01:23,656
Well, we made
good time today.

7
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:26,924
Red was one
of my students.

8
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,324
Hmm?

9
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,923
Not sure about
the dabbing though.

10
00:01:33,057 --> 00:01:35,290
Mom! Mom, did you
get my picture?

11
00:01:35,424 --> 00:01:37,125
Well, this is our stop.

14
00:01:49,123 --> 00:01:52,491
Today, we're gonna learn
about how Red saved the eggs.

15
00:01:52,622 --> 00:01:54,323
I love Red!

16
00:01:54,457 --> 00:01:56,623
I gotta go
to the bathroom!

17
00:01:56,757 --> 00:01:58,624
Why didn't you go
in the slingshot?

18
00:01:59,391 --> 00:02:00,490
Huh?

19
00:02:00,623 --> 00:02:02,424
Bomb, anything
from Piggy Island?

20
00:02:02,557 --> 00:02:04,656
- Nope.
- Chuck. Anything to the north?

21
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,657
- Nope. Nothing.
- What's that?

22
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:08,657
Uh-oh.

23
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:10,123
Incoming pie!

24
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:12,990
- It's coming straight for us.
- What do we do?

25
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:15,223
Duck!

26
00:02:15,357 --> 00:02:16,723
What?

27
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:18,156
Ah!

28
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,822
- I got pie all over my face!
- Hey, sorry, buddy.

29
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,490
What, what?
Yeah!

30
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:27,623
Those pigs...

31
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:28,789
Are gonna pay...

32
00:02:28,922 --> 00:02:30,858
For our lunches!

33
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:34,757
Uh... Because of our hunger
to give them...

34
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,123
A taste of their own...

35
00:02:36,257 --> 00:02:37,490
Quesadillas!

36
00:02:39,357 --> 00:02:40,223
What?

37
00:02:41,524 --> 00:02:43,324
- It's Red.
- I'm sorry, guys.

38
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,822
We're taking over the Blue Line.
Official business.

39
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,890
- Oh, yeah!
- Of course, anything for you.

40
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:49,258
Hey, Red!

41
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,589
Isn't it funny
how nobody liked you

42
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:54,191
until you saved Bird Island?
But now we all love you.

43
00:02:54,324 --> 00:02:56,324
Ha. Thanks so much
for bringing that up.

44
00:02:56,456 --> 00:02:57,756
Okay, ready?

45
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,425
- Three...
- Two...

46
00:02:59,556 --> 00:03:00,624
Two!

47
00:03:00,757 --> 00:03:02,690
- Bomb, you say "one."
- Oh, right.

48
00:03:02,822 --> 00:03:03,690
One!

49
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:13,457
Yoo-hoo.
Hot sauce, please.

50
00:03:14,589 --> 00:03:16,324
Yeah! Got him.

51
00:03:16,455 --> 00:03:18,323
- Thank you.
- <i>Red! Red!</i>

52
00:03:18,455 --> 00:03:21,622
I really want
the red one. The red one.

53
00:03:21,756 --> 00:03:23,023
Ha, ha! Balloonie!

54
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:25,624
Heh, heh. That's it.
A little bit higher.

55
00:03:26,724 --> 00:03:27,924
Ha, ha!

56
00:03:36,624 --> 00:03:39,057
But I was bouncing!

57
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:41,390
You mess with the hatchlings,

58
00:03:41,524 --> 00:03:43,258
you get the cannonball.

59
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,623
Ready, big guy?

60
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:46,823
Oh, yeah.
You ready, bigger guy?

61
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,623

63
00:03:57,557 --> 00:03:58,991
Why won't you
just take a bath?

64
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:01,157
Why won't you
just take a bath?

65
00:04:05,056 --> 00:04:07,956
Huh?

66
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,990
This might pinch a little.

67
00:04:18,422 --> 00:04:19,890
Ah! I can't see!

68
00:04:20,024 --> 00:04:22,091
Catch you later.

69
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,924
You stupid birds.

70
00:04:24,056 --> 00:04:26,257
No! Please, don't!

71
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,656
Aah!

72
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,357
Not on my watch.

73
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:34,790
Sorry, guys.

74
00:04:34,923 --> 00:04:36,124
Excuse me, sir,

75
00:04:36,258 --> 00:04:38,589
but I believe
this belongs to you.

76
00:04:38,724 --> 00:04:39,790
My hero.

77
00:04:39,923 --> 00:04:42,323
Don't. Stop.

78
00:04:42,456 --> 00:04:43,923
I said, "Don't stop."

79
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:47,290
- Leonard?
- Got him!

80
00:04:47,422 --> 00:04:49,623
Hey, Leonard,
you should probably...

81
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:50,923
Huh?

82
00:04:51,723 --> 00:04:52,889
That's not coming

83
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,590
from Bird Island.

84
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,740
What the heck is that?

85
00:05:42,874 --> 00:05:45,774
And where did it
come from?

86
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,107
We're gonna need
a bigger slingshot.

87
00:06:02,941 --> 00:06:05,907
Another successful day
of protecting the island.

88
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:06,906
Great job, guys.

89
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,607
Oh, yeah.

90
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:10,273
Woo-hoo! Woo!

91
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,107
You saved us, Red.

92
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,406
You're our hero.

93
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,306
Heh, what can I say?
That's what I do.

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,274
Now, why don't you
just go run along

95
00:06:17,407 --> 00:06:19,007
and keep your big,
cute eyes peeled

96
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:20,706
for the next pig prank,
all right?

97
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:24,040
Pigs.

98
00:06:24,174 --> 00:06:26,874
We're going to get you!

99
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,572
Oink, oink, oink.

100
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:31,174
Adorable.

101
00:06:31,306 --> 00:06:32,472
Let's finish cleaning up

102
00:06:32,606 --> 00:06:34,472
these crabs,
then we can move on to...

103
00:06:34,606 --> 00:06:35,639
Done and done.

104
00:06:38,007 --> 00:06:40,074
- Red, what is it?
- What the heck?

105
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:41,773
Is it a per...? Is it a head?

106
00:06:41,907 --> 00:06:43,873
What is that?

107
00:06:44,006 --> 00:06:46,773
Oh, look. It seems like
it's some kind of note.

108
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,007
What if it's
a love note?

109
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:49,240
A message in a bottle?

110
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:50,539
Or a genie in a bottle.

111
00:06:50,672 --> 00:06:51,740
Guys,
there's no bottle,

112
00:06:51,873 --> 00:06:53,573
so just,
you know, stop.

113
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,874
Nice try, piggies.

114
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:07,074
News flash:
We're not idiots.

115
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:08,206
Hey.

116
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,407
Uh...

117
00:07:21,306 --> 00:07:23,540
I got it!

118
00:07:23,673 --> 00:07:24,873
Oh, no!

119
00:07:25,008 --> 00:07:27,272
- Check it out, everybody.
- Let me see that.

120
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:29,774
- A truce! A truce!
- A truce with the pigs!

121
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:32,006
- A truce?
- The prank war is over!

122
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,607
What?

123
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:36,773
No, this is just another
one of their pranks.

124
00:07:36,907 --> 00:07:38,205
- What?
- Huh?

125
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,807
This is a huge relief,
right?

126
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,107
Who else
was getting tired

127
00:07:41,239 --> 00:07:42,973
of the pranking
and retaliation?

128
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,772
Me! This guy!

129
00:07:44,906 --> 00:07:46,539
Tired? No, no, no.
Guys, listen.

130
00:07:46,673 --> 00:07:48,807
Imagine all the fun things
we can do now.

131
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:50,907
I can think of one.

132
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,107
You think he'll go?

133
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,873
I think we've piqued
his interest.

134
00:07:54,008 --> 00:07:56,272
No, no, no. Guys,
we are working tirelessly,

135
00:07:56,406 --> 00:07:58,272
day and night,
to save the world.

136
00:07:58,407 --> 00:08:00,074
But the world
doesn't need saving.

137
00:08:00,207 --> 00:08:01,540
Of course they need us.

138
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:02,607
- Red.
- Huh?

139
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:03,774
Come here, hon.

140
00:08:03,906 --> 00:08:05,107
What are you so afraid of?

141
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,639
Afraid of? I...

142
00:08:06,773 --> 00:08:08,640
What do I have
to be afraid of?

00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,207
I'll write you a prescription
for fun with your cool friends.

149
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:32,606
- Especially Chuck.
- Come on. Come with us.

150
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,440
What are you talking...?
Come to what?

151
00:08:34,572 --> 00:08:37,008
We can't tell you because
you wouldn't be into it.

152
00:08:46,873 --> 00:08:48,807
Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

Oink, oink, oink!
Oink, oink, oink!

00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,574
Ha! Now we have
all your eggs.

155
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,606
And there's nothing
you can do about it,

156
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,240
- Red.
- Oink, oink, oink.

157
00:09:06,372 --> 00:09:09,106
Laugh it up, piggies,

158
00:09:09,239 --> 00:09:11,306
because you're gonna
be crying in a second

159
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:12,774
when I kick your butts

160
00:09:12,908 --> 00:09:14,739
- and take those rocks back.
- Eggs.

161
00:09:14,874 --> 00:09:16,305
- What?
- You said "rocks"

162
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:17,908
instead of "eggs" again.

163
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,872
Oh, sorry.

164
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,207
I don't know why
I keep doing that.

165
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,439
Because they are rocks.

166
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:29,105
Don't cry, Sam-Sam.

167
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,473
I'll be right back.

168
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:35,574
Hey, Daddy.

169
00:09:39,739 --> 00:09:41,772
Just borrowing my sisters
for a minute.

170
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:52,407
Ha. Now we really have
all your eggs.

171
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:56,073
Yeah, and there's nothing you
can do about it, Red.

172
00:09:56,207 --> 00:09:58,040
Oink, oink,
oink, oink, oink.

173
00:09:58,172 --> 00:09:59,772
Laugh it up, piggies,

174
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:02,072
because you're gonna be
crying in a second

175
00:10:02,206 --> 00:10:04,507

and take all your...

Uh, uh. Um, um, um, um.

178
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,207
Oh, crap.

179
00:10:24,606 --> 00:10:26,239
Okay, we'll just...

180
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:33,273
What is this thing that
almost killed me? Frozen water?

181
00:10:33,406 --> 00:10:34,906
Who's ever heard

00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,472
Courtney? Courtney,
bring me those images.

183
00:10:37,605 --> 00:10:40,772
What, what, what? Oh, okay,
I'm coming. I'm coming.

184
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:41,907
Give me that.

185
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,907
Oh, that looks cold.

186
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:46,340
Three umbrellas in one drink?

187
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:49,740
What kind of extravagant lunatic
are we dealing with?

188
00:10:53,506 --> 00:10:54,939
Mm.

189
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,439

I am tired of this.

193
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,306

Come on, baby. Go get it.

200
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:40,641
Let's go get it.

201
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:42,773
Go get the stick.

202
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,706
Ha, ha!

203
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:57,706
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.

00:11:57,841 --> 00:11:58,740
Oh, my gosh!

205
00:12:01,707 --> 00:12:03,172
I can't do this anymore.

206
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,573
- Okay, Debbie?
- Okay.

207
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:06,574
I'm done. I'm done living
on this frozen,

208
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:09,574
seal-infested iceberg
of an island.

209
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:11,774
Fire another ice ball!

210
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:14,707
- Uh... We can't do that, Zeta.
- Wait...

211
00:12:14,841 --> 00:12:16,240
You're torturing the engineer.

212
00:12:16,373 --> 00:12:18,972
Um, uh, Hello?!

213
00:12:19,106 --> 00:12:21,206
My limbs are beginning
to numb.

214
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,574
Oh, yeah, I forgot about that.

215
00:12:23,707 --> 00:12:25,473
You better tell him
to improve his aim.

216
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:29,272
It's about time we start
living that good life.

217
00:12:29,406 --> 00:12:30,972
Good life, here we come.

218
00:12:31,105 --> 00:12:33,739
I deserve to feel
the hot sand

219
00:12:33,872 --> 00:12:35,606
squishing between
my beautiful talons.

220
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,640
You deserve that and more.

221
00:12:37,773 --> 00:12:38,639
Yes, I do!

222
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,205
- Ha, ha!
- Well, here we are.

223
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,539
Are you ready, Red?
Love awaits!

224
00:12:50,673 --> 00:12:53,006
Speed dating? No. No way.

225
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,172
It's mating season.

226
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,674
All right, lovebirds.
You all know how this works.

227
00:12:57,808 --> 00:12:59,740
When you hear this sound...

228
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,273
...then it's time to move on
to the next table,

229
00:13:02,405 --> 00:13:05,072
where your soul mate
just might be waiting.

230
00:13:05,205 --> 00:13:06,574
Yeah, I'm going home.

231
00:13:06,706 --> 00:13:08,739
Absolutely not.
You have nothing else to do.

232
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:10,774
I hid your keys
on some part of my body,

233
00:13:10,906 --> 00:13:13,673
and I'm not telling you
where unless you stay. Ha, ha!

234
00:13:13,807 --> 00:13:15,506
Yeah, let's party!

235
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,072
Hey, yo!
Chuck's the name.

236
00:13:17,207 --> 00:13:18,906
- Speed's the game. Like games?
- Well...

237
00:13:19,038 --> 00:13:21,107
You entered the love lottery,
and guess what?

238
00:13:21,239 --> 00:13:24,239
You won!
Because here I am.

239
00:13:24,373 --> 00:13:26,140
- Hi.
- Hi.

240
00:13:28,106 --> 00:13:29,540
I eat dirt.

241
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:34,574
Oh. Ew.

242
00:13:34,706 --> 00:13:35,872
Hey, y'all!

243
00:13:36,006 --> 00:13:37,940
Who's ready to party?

244
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:40,239
Not me.

245
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,139
No, I'm actually not here
for the whole

246
00:13:42,273 --> 00:13:44,106
speed-dating horror-show thing
going on.

247
00:13:44,238 --> 00:13:45,306
Uh-uh. Shh.

248
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:47,606

is for you.

<i>♪ Y'all ready for this? ♪</i>

250
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,507
I'd love to hear
about you.

251
00:13:58,639 --> 00:13:59,839
What's your favorite sign?

252
00:13:59,972 --> 00:14:00,938
This one's mine.

253
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:04,372
You know, the flavor
can vary greatly,

254
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:06,240
depending on the minerals
in the dirt.

255
00:14:06,374 --> 00:14:09,340
I can tell which kind of worms
have crawled through there.

256
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:13,339
Or what sort of roly-polies used
it to raise their family in.

257
00:14:13,473 --> 00:14:14,905
Um. Are you mad?

258
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,340
No.

259
00:14:16,474 --> 00:14:18,873
- I don't know. You look mad.
- Well, I'm not.

260
00:14:19,006 --> 00:14:20,806
You know what?
Maybe it's your eyebrows.

261
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,139
My eyebrows are fine.
That's the way I look.

262
00:14:23,272 --> 00:14:26,206
It's like you've got
resting bird face.

263
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,406
Oh, yeah? Well, you know,
that's not a thing.

264
00:14:30,207 --> 00:14:32,540
- Yes! Amazing.
- I'm not a total animal.

265
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:34,239
But I do enjoy eating dirt.

266
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,072
Okay, worms, birdseed
or just garbage

267
00:14:36,206 --> 00:14:37,706
- from a dumpster?
- I'm sorry, what?

268
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:39,439
Favorite food, silly.
Don't think.

269
00:14:39,573 --> 00:14:40,938
Just answer from your gut. Go!

270
00:14:41,072 --> 00:14:42,706
Um. Uh, toast?

271
00:14:42,838 --> 00:14:44,739
Okay. Toast.

272
00:14:44,871 --> 00:14:45,906
Favorite color?

273
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,274
- Uh.
- Stupid question. Red, duh.

274
00:14:48,406 --> 00:14:51,206
If you could have one
superpower, what would it be?

275
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,573
Um, to disappear,
like, right now.

276
00:14:53,707 --> 00:14:56,674
Okay. What do you do
in your free time?

277
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:59,572
Yeah, I mean, I don't really
have any free time.

278
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:02,006
I kinda protect Bird Island
from being attacked,

279
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,739
and that's a full-time gig,
so yeah.

280
00:15:03,871 --> 00:15:05,839
I thought I heard something
about a truce.

281
00:15:05,973 --> 00:15:08,606
Ha, ha! No. A truce, no.
That's not gonna last.

282
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,340
You'll have a lot
more free time

283
00:15:10,473 --> 00:15:12,405
now that nobody needs you
anymore, so...

284
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,273
Okay. We are done here.

285
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,006
Are you afraid to talk

286
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,039
about your feelings?

287
00:15:18,173 --> 00:15:19,273
You know, just because

288
00:15:19,406 --> 00:15:20,872
I don't want to talk about them

289
00:15:21,006 --> 00:15:22,207
doesn't mean I'm afraid.

290
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,138
Okay. So avoids
personal questions.

291
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:25,872
- Unusually angry.
- Talks to herself.

292
00:15:26,006 --> 00:15:28,273
- Self-esteem issues.
- Doesn't answer own questions.

293
00:15:28,405 --> 00:15:29,539
Left-handed.
Probably a witch.

294
00:15:29,673 --> 00:15:31,872
Looks like we're
definitely incompatible.

295
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:34,273
Oh, and you needed a form
to tell you that. Okay.

296
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:36,273
Hope you have luck
annoying the next guy.

297
00:15:36,405 --> 00:15:38,606
I don't need luck.
I have a formula.

298
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:40,139
Okay. Have a nice life.

299
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,573
Have fun being alone.

300
00:15:41,706 --> 00:15:42,574
Oh, I will.

301
00:15:42,706 --> 00:15:43,873
Aw.

302
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:46,607
There he goes,
like a ship in the night.

303
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,906
No rudder, no purpose,
no crew.

304
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,706

No, we have a truce.

322
00:17:20,705 --> 00:17:23,072
Didn't you get my note?
It was on a balloon.

323
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:25,406
Oh, yeah, that's right.

324
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,873
You wanted to talk.

325
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,873
This is not how a truce works.

326

you gotta say

327
00:17:31,738 --> 00:17:32,939
and then get out.

328
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:34,605
Red, we've discovered

329
00:17:34,739 --> 00:17:36,805
that there's a third island,

330
00:17:36,939 --> 00:17:39,139
and they're plotting
to destroy us all.

331
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:40,273

Give me one reason
why I should believe you.

That image in your hand
is Eagle Island,

348
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,273
and those are eagles.

349
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,905
Eagles? How did you get these?

350
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,705
From a drone.

351
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:43,972
- And do you spy on us with that?
- Yes.

352
00:18:44,106 --> 00:18:46,805
So have you seen me...?

353
00:18:46,939 --> 00:18:49,972
Yes, and it's disgusting.

354
00:18:50,106 --> 00:18:52,239
Red, this is bigger than pranks.

355
00:18:52,373 --> 00:18:54,939
We need to put aside our
differences and work together.

356
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:58,307

from being destroyed.

00:19:00,506 --> 00:19:03,739
<i>Red! Red! Red!
Red! Red! Red!</i>

359
00:19:03,872 --> 00:19:07,205
What we really need is a hero.

360
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:08,206
I'm in.

361
00:19:08,339 --> 00:19:09,672
Wonderful!

362
00:19:10,972 --> 00:19:14,105
We'll have to get
a team together.

363
00:19:14,239 --> 00:19:15,705
Yes, we will.

364
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,539
But, hey, I'm in charge.

365
00:19:19,838 --> 00:19:22,206
Actually, that position's
been filled.

366
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,072
- Boo-yah!
- Uh.

367
00:19:24,206 --> 00:19:25,407
Yeah. By me.

368
00:19:28,873 --> 00:19:30,872
Oh, man, you're gonna
love this guy.

369
00:19:31,006 --> 00:19:32,539
Not the smartest bird
in the tree,

370
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:36,072
but what he lacks in smarts,
he makes up for in firepower.

371
00:19:36,206 --> 00:19:37,939
Achoo!

372
00:19:39,207 --> 00:19:40,973
- Happy birthday!
- Aah!

373
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:43,306
<i>We've got a number
two at the Porta Potty.</i>

374
00:19:45,771 --> 00:19:48,074
All right, I'm going!

375
00:19:53,072 --> 00:19:54,306
We're busting you out.

376
00:19:55,272 --> 00:19:56,606
Uh... how?

377
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,739
Aah!

378
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:01,039
Like that.

379
00:20:01,172 --> 00:20:02,907
Oh, I love it.

380
00:20:04,374 --> 00:20:06,039
Bomb, what was that noise?

381
00:20:06,173 --> 00:20:09,506
- You're still grounded!
- I'm an adult, Mom!

382
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:11,240
- Run.
- Bomb, get back here!

383
00:20:11,372 --> 00:20:12,572
Aah!

384
00:20:12,705 --> 00:20:14,405
This guy is so fast,
he can beat time

385
00:20:14,539 --> 00:20:15,873
itself in a footrace.

386
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,240
Hey, Chuck, we're putting
together a team.

387
00:20:18,373 --> 00:20:19,772
And I think
we're on it!

388
00:20:32,872 --> 00:20:35,239
Come on, everybody.
Let's work those booties!

389
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:42,940
I'm in.

390
00:20:45,339 --> 00:20:47,705
- Ha, ha, great!
- But how did you...?

391
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,273
BT-dubs,
you misspelled "heist."

392
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:50,806
It's "E-I,"
I corrected it.

393
00:20:50,939 --> 00:20:52,273
Don't worry.
It's a common misperception.

394
00:20:52,406 --> 00:20:53,739
Well, thank you.

395
00:20:53,873 --> 00:20:56,572
You're right. He's fast.

396
00:20:58,371 --> 00:21:00,773
<i>Now,
this guy is kind of a ding-dong,</i>

397
00:21:00,906 --> 00:21:02,606
<i>but he's the only
eagle we know.</i>

398
00:21:02,739 --> 00:21:03,907
Well, you've come

399
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,872
to the right eagle.
Tell me more.

400
00:21:06,006 --> 00:21:08,906
It's a really exciting mission
to a place called Eagle...

401
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:11,039
- Eagle Island?
- Yes.

402
00:21:11,173 --> 00:21:12,940
So you've heard...

403
00:21:13,072 --> 00:21:14,505
Heard of it.

404
00:21:19,305 --> 00:21:21,438
Nice to meet you!

405
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:24,005
Okay, so now we just need
to figure out

406
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,240
how this volcanic
super-weapon works, huh?

407
00:21:26,372 --> 00:21:29,772
We're gonna need some kind
of engineering wizard, brainiac.

408
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:32,505
- Hm.
- Hm.

409
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,005
Oh!

410
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:38,706
Yes, Chuck. You obviously
have something

411
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,439
you want to say or sing.

412
00:21:40,572 --> 00:21:43,307
I have got just the guy.
It's a girl.

413
00:21:43,439 --> 00:21:44,906
My sister Silver.

414
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,073
She goes to Avian Academy,
top of her class.

415
00:21:47,206 --> 00:21:49,906
- She would be perfect.
- Yeah, she totally would.

416
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,639
- See you at the dorm!
- Yeah, see you, Ella.

417
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:56,073
Hey, good catch!

418
00:21:56,206 --> 00:21:59,272
I mean, we all just thought
she was weird, you know?

419
00:21:59,406 --> 00:22:00,572
She skipped four grades,

420
00:22:00,705 --> 00:22:02,240
won an Engineer
of the Year Award,

421
00:22:02,372 --> 00:22:04,140
and got a scholarship
at Avian Academy.

422
00:22:04,273 --> 00:22:06,539
Perfect. That is exactly
what we're looking for.

423
00:22:06,671 --> 00:22:08,206
You are absolutely
gonna love her.

424
00:22:08,339 --> 00:22:11,073
But don't love her too much.
That's my sister, Red.

425
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:13,838
Or I'll crush
every bone in your body!

426
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,039
Oh. Frisbee!

427
00:22:17,738 --> 00:22:20,405
Hi, I'm Chuck. Know where
the Engineering department is?

428
00:22:22,205 --> 00:22:24,338
With a combination
of over 30 silk,

429
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,706
wire and cotton-based
threads spun together,

430
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,705
I now present to you...

431
00:22:28,839 --> 00:22:30,373
Super String!

432
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:35,371
I said, "It's Super String!"

433
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:36,705
More like
"Stupid String."

434
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,571
I know what
you're thinking, Mike.

435
00:22:38,705 --> 00:22:40,572
You're like,
"What's so super about it?"

436
00:22:40,705 --> 00:22:42,039
Great question, Mike.

437
00:22:42,173 --> 00:22:44,106
Well, how about that
it's very easily able

438
00:22:44,239 --> 00:22:46,973
to withstand the pull
of 18,000 more kilos

439
00:22:47,106 --> 00:22:48,606
than any other string known to...

440
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:51,905
Snooze alert.

441
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:53,573
Known to bird-kind!

442
00:22:53,706 --> 00:22:55,540
Or pig-kind,
for that matter.

443
00:22:59,238 --> 00:23:00,406
What's up, sis?

444
00:23:00,538 --> 00:23:01,705
Chuck?

445
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,473
I'm so happy to... It's really...

446
00:23:04,606 --> 00:23:06,472
Great to... Jinx, jinx.

447
00:23:06,606 --> 00:23:08,606
- Jinx!
- Jinx. One, two, three. I win!

448
00:23:08,739 --> 00:23:11,206
You can't speak until someone
says your name.

449
00:23:11,338 --> 00:23:13,705
Hello? You in here?

450
00:23:13,839 --> 00:23:15,606
Hello?

451
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:17,938
- You?
- You?

452
00:23:18,072 --> 00:23:19,205
You.

453
00:23:19,338 --> 00:23:21,271
Wait. You know this guy?

454
00:23:21,405 --> 00:23:23,572
I would
answer, but you jinxed me.

455
00:23:23,706 --> 00:23:26,373
Oh, okay, Chuck,
I unjinx you.

456
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:29,239
This is one of my best buddies,
Red. These are the guys.

457
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:30,439
- Hi.
- We're the guys.

458
00:23:30,572 --> 00:23:32,106
Guys, this is Silver,

459
00:23:32,238 --> 00:23:33,938
the greatest kid sister
in the world.

460
00:23:34,072 --> 00:23:36,072
I'm not exactly
a kid anymore, Chuck.

461
00:23:36,205 --> 00:23:37,906
Oh, you'll always be
my kid sister!

462
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,972
Okay. Hey, everyone.

463
00:23:40,106 --> 00:23:42,140
You know, I don't think
this is gonna work.

464
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:43,973
It's just that
I'm not sure

465
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:46,107
you're gonna be compatible
with the team.

466
00:23:46,239 --> 00:23:51,272
Oh, wow, it is such a pleasure
to meet not you, but you!

467
00:23:51,406 --> 00:23:52,773
I've never met
a pig before.

468
00:23:52,906 --> 00:23:55,606
Your technological achievements
are amazing.

469
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,140
- May I shake your hoof?
- Why, thank you.

470
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,238
I like her.

471
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:03,039
- And this has to be Bomb.
- Whoa!

472
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:04,439
How'd you know that?

473
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:06,471
You have a fuse
coming out of your head.

474
00:24:06,606 --> 00:24:07,972
Oh, so cool!

475
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,505
Backflip.

476
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:13,906
So I, um... I hear
you're some kind of

477
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,039
engineering wizard
or whatever.

478
00:24:16,172 --> 00:24:19,573
Oh, ha. I mean, I don't like
to brag, but...

479
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:20,706
Wait. Who's that?

480
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,871
And why is she all over

481
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:23,171
these achievement awards?

482
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:28,106
The kid's amazing, right?

483
00:24:28,238 --> 00:24:29,605
Not a kid anymore, Chuck.

484
00:24:29,739 --> 00:24:32,739
Toot toot! Tickle Train
arriving at Sister Station!

485
00:24:32,872 --> 00:24:33,738
Chuck, no.

486
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:36,073
I am a serious academic.

487
00:24:36,205 --> 00:24:37,571
I am a serious...

488
00:24:39,805 --> 00:24:40,706
Stop!

489
00:24:42,839 --> 00:24:44,306

Woo-hoo! We did it.

500
00:25:07,572 --> 00:25:09,938
That was so easy!

501
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:11,406
Yeah!

502
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,205
A little too easy,
actually.

503
00:25:14,338 --> 00:25:15,838
What do you mean
by that?

504
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:18,706
Well, normally,
when things are this easy,

505
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:23,204
some dramatically
unexpected setback occurs.

506
00:25:23,338 --> 00:25:25,171
- I don't get it.
- Me neither.

507
00:25:25,306 --> 00:25:28,438
Well, it's kind
of hard to explain.

508
00:25:28,572 --> 00:25:31,239
But it's sort of like,
you know how some...?

509
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,339
Oh, see? Like that.

510
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:40,273
Are you freaking
kidding me?

511
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:49,239
Each of you has
been selected because

512
00:25:49,371 --> 00:25:50,772
you're the best
in your field.

513
00:25:50,906 --> 00:25:52,906
- Oh.
- That we could find.

514
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,238
Oh.

515
00:25:54,372 --> 00:25:56,539
Your skills will be
put to the test

516
00:25:56,672 --> 00:25:58,773
facing this.

517
00:25:58,906 --> 00:26:00,939
As you can clearly see,
this is a vol...

518
00:26:01,071 --> 00:26:02,238
Volcano.

519
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:04,538
"A volcano" is what
my assistant

520
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:05,805
was going to say.

521
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,773
- You're the assistant!
- Let go. Let go.

522
00:26:07,906 --> 00:26:09,539
- No, I'm the leader.
- I'll take that.

523
00:26:09,673 --> 00:26:12,306
Actually,
it's a composite volcano.

524
00:26:12,439 --> 00:26:13,640
You can tell
by the height

525
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,205
and the apparent
vent clusters.

526
00:26:15,339 --> 00:26:17,506
Okay, forget I said "volcano."

527
00:26:17,639 --> 00:26:20,440
This is a...
It's a super-weapon!

528
00:26:21,573 --> 00:26:22,606
Weird, because it looks

529
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:23,706
just like a volcano.

530
00:26:23,838 --> 00:26:26,538
Yep, and here's
the scary part.

531
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:29,272
This is their
psychotic leader!

532
00:26:30,905 --> 00:26:33,905
Ooh! How'd that get
in there? Ha, ha. Next.

533
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:36,505
- Oh, butt shot.
- Next. No. Next. Next!

534
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:38,772
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

535
00:26:38,906 --> 00:26:40,071
Courtney!

536
00:26:40,204 --> 00:26:41,940
I mean, you took them.

537
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:46,739
This is their
psychotic leader.

538
00:26:53,505 --> 00:26:56,305
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey. Buddy, do you know her?

539
00:26:56,438 --> 00:26:58,204
What? Me? No.

540
00:26:58,338 --> 00:26:59,905
No, definitely not,
absolutely not.

541
00:27:00,038 --> 00:27:01,538
Never seen her
before in my life.

542
00:27:01,672 --> 00:27:03,573
Who is that? I don't know!

543
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:07,038
Not terribly convincing,
but moving on.

544
00:27:07,172 --> 00:27:09,072
Great.
What's the plan?

545
00:27:09,204 --> 00:27:11,472
All right, here's what
we're looking at, folks.

546
00:27:11,605 --> 00:27:14,972
Step one: Travel undetected
to Eagle Island.

547
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:16,072
- Hmm.
- Uh-huh.

548
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:18,039
Step two: We're gonna break

549
00:27:18,172 --> 00:27:20,773
into the super-weapon.

550
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:23,338
- Got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

551
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:24,706
And step three:

552
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,772
Ooh, ooh.

553
00:27:25,906 --> 00:27:27,939
Deactivate the superweapon.

554
00:27:28,071 --> 00:27:29,271
Once we break in there...

555
00:27:29,405 --> 00:27:31,538
No plan...

556
00:27:31,672 --> 00:27:34,504
hopefully, before both islands
are destroyed and we all die,

557
00:27:34,638 --> 00:27:36,873
so that's, uh... That's it.

558
00:27:37,006 --> 00:27:39,539
Right. So I just have
a few questions.

559
00:27:39,672 --> 00:27:40,940
Why? I explained everything.

560
00:27:41,072 --> 00:27:42,237
It's a foolproof plan.

561
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:44,171
Yeah. How do we sneak
onto the island?

562
00:27:44,304 --> 00:27:46,771
What is the super-weapon
and how do we deactivate it?

563
00:27:46,905 --> 00:27:49,439
And when you say "escape,"
how do you plan to do that?

564
00:27:49,573 --> 00:27:51,305
This is a crucial
thing to figure out.

565
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,205
I agree.
Why isn't she in charge?

566
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,606
Told you she's super smart.

567
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,405
Hey, guys,
hold on a second, please.

568
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,906
- Mighty Eagle?
- What? What are you looking at?

569
00:27:59,038 --> 00:28:00,971
Do you have
an Eagle Island map?

570
00:28:01,105 --> 00:28:04,204
What? No. No, there's no map.

571
00:28:04,339 --> 00:28:06,137
- Oh, it's a map.
- Yeah, that's a map.

572
00:28:06,271 --> 00:28:08,939
Mm-hm. Okay,
I just wanna read it.

573
00:28:09,072 --> 00:28:10,872
Wait a minute.
Do you guys hear that?

574
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:12,304
Do we hear what?

575
00:28:12,438 --> 00:28:14,071
Sounds like a, um,
like a whistle.

576
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:15,405
It almost sounds like a:

577
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:21,106
Hey, guys?

578
00:28:22,304 --> 00:28:23,405
Run!

579
00:28:25,806 --> 00:28:29,171
Emergency exit,
all the way down!

580
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,905
Well, that's not safe.

581
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:34,505
Wait! Stop!

582
00:28:34,638 --> 00:28:37,373
- Holy macaroni!
- Oh, boy.

583
00:28:39,037 --> 00:28:40,505
Everyone hop on!

584
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:55,304
Rewind it. Rewind it.
Play it again.

585
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:56,806
Play it again.
Play it again.

586
00:28:59,005 --> 00:29:02,305
Ha, ha. Yes, baby! We knocked
the top right off of that!

587
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:04,238
Glenn, you didn't mess
it up this time.

588
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:06,205
- Boom! Up top. Or not.
- Nailed it!

589
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:07,372
Jerry, up top.

590
00:29:07,506 --> 00:29:08,871
That should send him running.

591
00:29:09,005 --> 00:29:10,205
Wait. "Him"?

592
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:11,806
Who you sending running?

593
00:29:11,938 --> 00:29:14,371
Yeah. Who's "him"?

594
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:18,905
"Them." I said "them."
Stop asking me stupid questions.

595
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,905
I'm so sorry.

596
00:29:21,038 --> 00:29:22,038
- Wow.
- That was crazy.

597
00:29:22,172 --> 00:29:23,405
We could have died.

598
00:29:23,539 --> 00:29:25,506
Thanks for saving our lives,
Mighty Eagle!

599
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,339
Well, you can always
count on...

600
00:29:35,238 --> 00:29:37,206
Everyone grab the map!

601
00:29:44,904 --> 00:29:45,838
Hey, it's working.

602
00:29:48,139 --> 00:29:50,838
Left! Left! Lean to the left!

603
00:29:55,439 --> 00:29:57,438
Please tell me
that was your pants ripping.

604
00:29:57,572 --> 00:29:58,972
I don't wear pants!

605
00:29:59,105 --> 00:30:01,573
None of us wear pants!

606
00:30:04,671 --> 00:30:05,572
Uh-oh.

607
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:15,439
Eight point one seconds.

608
00:30:17,738 --> 00:30:19,772
Silver! No!

609
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,171
Oh.

610
00:30:42,305 --> 00:30:43,538
Uh...

611
00:30:43,672 --> 00:30:45,338
- Heh, heh.
- Hey!

612
00:30:45,473 --> 00:30:46,373
What is this?

613
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,871
Oh, well, I mean,
she was, you know,

614
00:30:50,006 --> 00:30:52,005
just thanking me
for saving everyone, so...

615
00:30:52,139 --> 00:30:53,739
- I'm sorry. Saving everyone?
- Yeah.

616
00:30:53,871 --> 00:30:55,572
You know,
the map was my idea.

617
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:56,870
It ripped.

618
00:30:57,004 --> 00:30:58,804
Maybe because there's
too many birds.

619
00:30:58,939 --> 00:30:59,905
I...

620
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:04,640
My mountain!

621
00:31:06,106 --> 00:31:07,872
We are in trouble.

622
00:31:08,004 --> 00:31:10,038
We gotta stop
that super-weapon.

623
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:12,206
Jinx!

624
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:16,972
Oh, this is bad.
This is really bad.

625
00:31:17,106 --> 00:31:18,139
Eagle Mountain?

626
00:31:18,271 --> 00:31:20,239
Are we gonna be okay?

627
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:23,772
Oh, my gah...

628
00:31:25,938 --> 00:31:29,204
What happened
to Eagle Mountain, Mom?

629
00:31:29,338 --> 00:31:30,771
Wait a minute.
Wait. Wait. Wait.

630
00:31:30,904 --> 00:31:33,938
Why isn't anybody leaving?
Why they not scared?

631
00:31:35,371 --> 00:31:37,504
Okay. Oh, okay, okay.

632
00:31:37,638 --> 00:31:39,837
Here's what we gonna do.

633
00:31:39,971 --> 00:31:42,772
I want y'all to take
all of those ice balls

634
00:31:42,905 --> 00:31:45,506
and fill them up with... Ha, ha...

635
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:47,505
Molten lava.

636
00:31:49,172 --> 00:31:51,205
That's not possible.

637
00:31:51,339 --> 00:31:53,573
What? You never heard
of thermal emulsifiers?

638
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,372
Well, yes, yes.

639
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:58,271
You just got to get
a polyacrylamide

640
00:31:58,404 --> 00:31:59,638
to enhance the nanoparticle

641
00:31:59,772 --> 00:32:00,971
and surfactant association

642
00:32:01,104 --> 00:32:02,372
between the two materials.

643
00:32:03,238 --> 00:32:04,804
Uh. Okay.

644
00:32:04,937 --> 00:32:08,373
So you do that,
and I'm gonna go feed my baby.

645
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:10,138
Yes, I'm finally gonna
feed my baby.

646
00:32:10,272 --> 00:32:12,573
There you go.
Who's my baby?

647
00:32:12,705 --> 00:32:13,739
You're my baby.

648
00:32:17,238 --> 00:32:18,905
What...? Don't...

649
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:21,805
You better not wink at me.
Don't you wink at me.

650
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:26,971
Who could have done this?

651
00:32:27,105 --> 00:32:29,838
- I can't believe it.
- Are we gonna be okay?

652
00:32:29,971 --> 00:32:32,772
- What are we gonna do?
- All right, guys, do not worry.

653
00:32:32,905 --> 00:32:34,205
We got this.

654
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:36,738
Red here has got your back.

655
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,439
And your front
and your sides.

656
00:32:38,573 --> 00:32:39,738
And my floof?

657
00:32:39,871 --> 00:32:42,104
Yeah, even your cute
little floof.

658
00:32:42,238 --> 00:32:44,372
Looks like
you're gonna be okay.

659
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:48,338
So are you 100 percent sure
we shouldn't evacuate?

660
00:32:48,471 --> 00:32:50,772
No, Red's gonna take care
of us. Right, Red?

661
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:54,405
Yes! Everybody, please,
just stay calm.

662
00:32:54,539 --> 00:32:56,105
Great news!
Thank you!

663
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:57,705
We're gonna be okay.
Red's here.

664
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,937
- We love you, Red!
- We need you!

665
00:33:00,072 --> 00:33:00,938
Oh, thank you.

666
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:01,938
Your support means

667
00:33:02,071 --> 00:33:03,039
the world to me.

668
00:33:04,106 --> 00:33:04,971
Okay, Leonard,

669
00:33:05,105 --> 00:33:06,139
so where's our ride?

670
00:33:08,272 --> 00:33:09,572
Aw.

671
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:11,239
It's so cute.

672
00:33:11,371 --> 00:33:14,938
Wow. Okay. And how are we all
supposed to fit in...?

673
00:33:15,072 --> 00:33:16,871
Oh, I think we'll manage.

674
00:33:17,005 --> 00:33:17,972
Boop.

675
00:33:21,272 --> 00:33:22,473
Whoa, okay.

676
00:33:24,338 --> 00:33:25,373
Whoa.

677
00:33:34,405 --> 00:33:36,604
Oh, my gah...

678
00:33:36,737 --> 00:33:38,206
All aboard!

679
00:33:38,339 --> 00:33:40,439
Whoa.

680
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:43,272
Anyone want to grab
their own bag or anything?

681
00:33:48,072 --> 00:33:50,205
Don't screw this up,
Red!

682
00:33:51,671 --> 00:33:54,038
If we die, it's kind
of your fault.

683
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:59,439
I got this.

684
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:52,272
Wow.

685
00:34:52,405 --> 00:34:54,538
Ow!

686
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,238
Ladies and gentlemen,

687
00:34:56,372 --> 00:35:00,172
I'd like to introduce you
to our master of gadgetry:

688
00:35:00,305 --> 00:35:01,671
- Garry!
- Garry!

689
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:04,604
This is it?

690
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,138
This is the amazing team

691
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,071
I've been working around
the clock for?

692
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:11,138
Ha, ha. Working with
what we got.

693
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:14,906
Well, that's disappointing.

694
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,438
Wow. Okay.

695
00:35:17,571 --> 00:35:21,373
This is the part
where you get up and follow me!

696
00:35:23,571 --> 00:35:26,071
Welcome to my
piggy gadget lab.

697
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:27,804
Oh, yeah.

698
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:30,204
Everywhere you
look, you'll see inventions

699
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:33,238
being tested
by my team of guinea pigs.

700
00:35:33,371 --> 00:35:36,704
- Oh. This is so cool.
- I know. Right?

701
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:39,338
All the gadgets have
been designed specifically

702
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,571
with your current mission
in mind.

703
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:44,339
The first being Invisa-Spray.

704
00:35:44,472 --> 00:35:47,372
Need to go undetected
in plain sight?

705
00:35:47,505 --> 00:35:49,838
Invisa-Spray does
exactly that.

706
00:35:49,972 --> 00:35:51,672
Wow, I'm invisible!

707
00:35:51,805 --> 00:35:52,872
Whoa.

708
00:35:53,004 --> 00:35:54,272
"Whoa," indeed.

709
00:35:54,405 --> 00:35:55,604
That's amazing.

710
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:58,172
How long does
the invisibility last for?

711
00:35:58,305 --> 00:36:00,406
- Forever.
- Wait. What?

712
00:36:00,539 --> 00:36:02,571
Tina, we're not gonna be able

713
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,071
to see each other tonight.

714
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:07,172
And what does the next
gadget do? Bury us alive?

715
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:09,905
What? That would be ridiculous.

716
00:36:10,039 --> 00:36:12,372
<i>Ix-nay the shovel-ay.</i>

717
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:14,639
And moving right along.

718
00:36:14,771 --> 00:36:17,038
What are you guys doing?

719
00:36:17,172 --> 00:36:19,139
This is so fun!

720
00:36:19,271 --> 00:36:20,538
Oh, it's so squishy.

721
00:36:20,671 --> 00:36:22,071
What is this stuff?

722
00:36:22,205 --> 00:36:23,938
Oh, well,
that is a special type

723
00:36:24,072 --> 00:36:26,306
of flame retardant
we call pig snot.

724
00:36:28,273 --> 00:36:30,739
Why do you call it...?
You know what? Never mind.

725
00:36:31,537 --> 00:36:33,038
Ugh.

726
00:36:38,704 --> 00:36:40,604
Yeah! Lick it.

727
00:36:40,738 --> 00:36:42,905
Now, everyone,
prepare yourselves

728
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,704
'cause this next one
is really something special.

729
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:48,372
Whoa. So shiny.

730
00:36:48,504 --> 00:36:52,571
Yes, my friend. Bold yet sleek.
Simple while complex.

731
00:36:52,704 --> 00:36:55,271
This device can detect
an eagle anywhere

732
00:36:55,404 --> 00:36:57,906
within a 100-foot radius.

733
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:04,105
- Well, how does it work?
- Simply push this button,

734
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,072
and it does the rest.

735
00:37:06,206 --> 00:37:07,838
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

736
00:37:07,972 --> 00:37:10,405
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

737
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:12,071
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

738
00:37:12,205 --> 00:37:14,704
<i>There's an eagle nearby.
There's an eagle nearby.</i>

739
00:37:14,838 --> 00:37:16,938
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

740
00:37:17,072 --> 00:37:20,872
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Why, yes. Clearly, there is.

741
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:23,305
- Okay, you got me, guys.
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

742
00:37:23,438 --> 00:37:26,139
- This clever thing will...
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

743
00:37:26,271 --> 00:37:28,604
- no doubt prove to be...
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

744
00:37:28,737 --> 00:37:31,805
- crucial during your mission.
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

745
00:37:31,939 --> 00:37:34,305
- Wonderful. That's amazing!
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

746
00:37:34,438 --> 00:37:36,537
- Can you turn it off?
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

747
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:38,872
- It'll turn itself off.
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

748
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:41,071
Oh, thank goodness.

749
00:37:41,205 --> 00:37:44,370
One hour after it doesn't
detect any more eagles.

750
00:37:44,504 --> 00:37:46,038
- What?
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

751
00:37:46,173 --> 00:37:47,738
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>
- Hey! Hey!

752
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:49,905
<i>There's an eagle near...</i>

753
00:37:50,037 --> 00:37:52,404
- There.
- Oh, thank you.

754
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,839
Okay, guys,
these gadgets are terri...

755
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,173
Hey, hey, Red,
can we chat for a sec?

756
00:37:58,972 --> 00:38:00,937
I can tell you're used
to running the show.

757
00:38:01,071 --> 00:38:03,938
That's great and all. But maybe
since we're all a team here,

758
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:05,604
a team you put together,

759
00:38:05,738 --> 00:38:08,905
maybe you can try
to be more supportive.

760
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:11,937
The results might
surprise you, huh?

761
00:38:12,071 --> 00:38:13,904
Fine. Fine, fine, fine.

762
00:38:14,038 --> 00:38:17,705
Garry. Woo. Unbelievable.
Really, really good stuff.

763
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:20,404
You know what? I'm sure
I can figure out a plan to...

764
00:38:20,537 --> 00:38:22,138
You know,
to use all this...

765
00:38:22,271 --> 00:38:24,538
This awesomeness that you've...
Bomb!

766
00:38:28,238 --> 00:38:29,539
Hi, Red.

767
00:38:34,738 --> 00:38:36,605
How are we ever

768
00:38:36,738 --> 00:38:38,705
gonna get up there?

769
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:42,704
I want my unborn sisters back.

770
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:46,338
It's just, the eggs are
up there, and we're down here.

771
00:38:46,471 --> 00:38:47,604
Oh, how are we
ever gonna

772
00:38:47,738 --> 00:38:49,206
get up there?

773
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:51,537
Oh.

774
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,405
You're doing great, Zoe.

775
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:10,538
Now hold it tight, okay?

776
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:19,704
Uh-oh.

777
00:39:19,838 --> 00:39:21,073
Quick, let some air out!

778
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:30,537
It won't untie!

779
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:33,138
Okay, let me try. Aah!

780
00:39:33,272 --> 00:39:34,905
What's...? What's the prob...?

781
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,038
Prob... Prob...

782
00:39:36,172 --> 00:39:37,972

787

The eggs!

788
00:40:23,539 --> 00:40:26,304
We got you for reals now.
Mwah!

789
00:40:26,438 --> 00:40:28,805
See? I told you I would
get us out of this.

790
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,139
A boa constructor.

791
00:40:48,537 --> 00:40:51,205
It is glorious! I'm a genius!

792
00:40:55,838 --> 00:40:58,438
Yes, I love it!
This was my idea.

793
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:00,404
- Wait. Wait.
- Look out!

794
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:03,238
- Aah! I'm burning!
- I told you to look out.

795
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,203
Glenn, I wanted lava balls,
not lava puddles.

796
00:41:07,337 --> 00:41:10,038
Uh-oh.
Glenn's messing up.

797
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:14,605
I mean, we... We're very close.
We just need two more weeks.

798
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:16,839
Two weeks? Two weeks.

799
00:41:16,971 --> 00:41:18,237
Huh.

800
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,105
Um. It's quite
the undertaking.

801
00:41:20,237 --> 00:41:23,571
Okay, okay, you know what?
I'm doing that thing again.

802
00:41:23,705 --> 00:41:26,705
That thing, you know, like,
where I'm not quite sure

803
00:41:26,838 --> 00:41:28,705
I heard
what I think I heard.

804
00:41:28,838 --> 00:41:30,870
Hey, skinny, sassy face!

805
00:41:31,004 --> 00:41:33,605
Did you hear "two weeks,"
or did you hear "tomorrow"?

806
00:41:33,739 --> 00:41:36,638
Um. Uh, I heard "tomorrow"?

807
00:41:36,772 --> 00:41:38,471
Fat dude,
what did you hear?

808
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:40,938
Uh. Definitely
what you said?

809
00:41:41,072 --> 00:41:42,705
Okay, you know what
I'm gonna do?

810
00:41:42,838 --> 00:41:45,471
I am gonna call
my old engineer, Steve.

811
00:41:45,605 --> 00:41:47,472
And you know what?
You're a lot like him.

812
00:41:49,705 --> 00:41:51,438
<i>Hey, it's Steve!</i>

813
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:53,572
<i>Sorry I can't come
to the phone right now...</i>

814
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:56,005
<i>...but you know what to do.</i>

815
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:59,370
Oh, yeah.
I had to discipline Steve.

816
00:41:59,504 --> 00:42:00,938
So, what was that
that you

817
00:42:01,072 --> 00:42:03,005
- had said to me?
- Tomorrow.

818
00:42:03,138 --> 00:42:05,839
That's what I thought you said.
See, everybody happy now.

to save, kids.

830
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,070
Two islands. We have two
islands to save.

831
00:43:16,203 --> 00:43:18,404
I can't do this.

832
00:43:18,538 --> 00:43:21,270
- I've made a terrible mistake.
- What are you talking about?

833
00:43:21,404 --> 00:43:23,605
Zeta.

834
00:43:23,739 --> 00:43:26,071
- Who is Zeta?
- The leader of the eagles.

835
00:43:26,204 --> 00:43:28,772
The one who's been trying
to destroy our islands.

836
00:43:28,904 --> 00:43:31,938
And my ex-fiancée.

837
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:34,204
- Wait. What?
- Did you say "fiancée"?

838
00:43:34,337 --> 00:43:35,738
Beyoncé?

00:43:35,872 --> 00:43:37,738

How could you
leave like that?

863

that about me.

Well, actually...

866
00:44:50,538 --> 00:44:53,437
I assume she's been
heartbroken ever since.

867
00:44:53,571 --> 00:44:55,038
It's all my fault.

868
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:57,437
So this is Beyoncé
we're talking about?

869
00:44:57,571 --> 00:44:59,437

I just remembered.

you pedal.

885
00:46:03,170 --> 00:46:07,204
Wait. You guys came up
with this idea without me?

886
00:46:07,338 --> 00:46:09,338
Yeah.

887
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:15,738
<i>♪ All by myself ♪</i>

888
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:20,904
<i>♪ Don't wanna be
All by myself ♪</i>

889
00:46:21,038 --> 00:46:23,338
Yeah, well,
it's not gonna work.

890
00:46:23,472 --> 00:46:26,272
We think it's our best chance
of getting past the guards.

891
00:46:26,404 --> 00:46:27,437
- I'm with Silver.
- Me too.

892
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:28,437
Yeah, she's smart.

893
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:29,837
Everyone is counting on me

894
00:46:29,971 --> 00:46:31,038
to make sure that...

895
00:46:31,171 --> 00:46:33,437
Us. Everyone's counting
on us.

896
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:35,571
Fine. Whatever.
So your plan is to get

897
00:46:35,705 --> 00:46:37,237
into the super-weapon
with that?

898
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:39,739
Harvey, don't take offense.
He does not mean it.

899
00:46:39,870 --> 00:46:43,103
Fine. Fine. You know what?

900
00:46:43,237 --> 00:46:46,870
I'll just be up here
saving the world.

901
00:46:47,004 --> 00:46:50,272
Just like I should
have been doing this whole time.

902
00:46:50,405 --> 00:46:54,137
Uh, guys? I 100 percent believe
in you and this Harvey idea,

903
00:46:54,271 --> 00:46:57,205
but I think this one's
gonna need me.

904
00:47:43,246 --> 00:47:44,747
Well, they didn't see us.

905
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,980
This isn't
an "us" thing, Silver.

906
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:50,147
I've got this covered.
Go away.

907
00:47:51,878 --> 00:47:53,845
Is this a good time
to talk about feelings?

908
00:47:53,978 --> 00:47:55,813
No, it's not a good time!

909
00:48:05,412 --> 00:48:07,579
No. No, I don't need
your help, okay?

910
00:48:07,713 --> 00:48:09,714
I meant to slip.
Leave me alone!

911
00:48:10,645 --> 00:48:12,445
Your hat fell off.

912
00:48:12,579 --> 00:48:15,513
Yeah, I got rid of it
because it was getting heavy.

913
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,979
All right, guys,
beak action is a go.

914
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:29,647
- Arms, what say you?
- Armed and ready.

915
00:48:33,180 --> 00:48:35,612
Two fully functional armies.

916
00:48:35,747 --> 00:48:37,879
Right above our leggies.
Ha, ha.

917
00:48:38,012 --> 00:48:41,146
Okay, leggies,
show me what you got.

918
00:48:45,079 --> 00:48:46,346
Oh, yeah.

919
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:47,480
Woo-hoo!

920
00:48:47,613 --> 00:48:48,680
We got this!

921
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:50,913
We must look amazing!

922
00:48:54,713 --> 00:48:56,813
Okay, guys,
we're going live.

923
00:48:56,946 --> 00:48:58,513
Come on, Jerry.

924
00:48:58,646 --> 00:49:00,944
You know there's no snacking
while we're on duty.

925
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,113
But I had a really
small breakfast.

926
00:49:03,246 --> 00:49:05,178
All right, I'll do the talking.

927
00:49:06,746 --> 00:49:08,746
Hello, fellow eagle guards.

928
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:09,846
- Hm?
- Hm?

929
00:49:09,978 --> 00:49:11,646
Oh, no.
He's doing a voice.

930
00:49:11,778 --> 00:49:14,313
I'm running late
to the old job.

931
00:49:14,445 --> 00:49:17,312
Commute was rough today
for some reason.

932
00:49:17,447 --> 00:49:20,647
But the good news
is I made it!

933
00:49:21,913 --> 00:49:23,613
Ninety-degree turn. Quick!

934
00:49:23,746 --> 00:49:26,380
But the
good news is I made it.

935
00:49:27,178 --> 00:49:28,279
ID, please.

936
00:49:28,413 --> 00:49:30,846
Oh. Uh... ID?

937
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:33,046
Uh. Not sure I have it on me.

938
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:35,645
Act like
you're checking pockets.

939
00:49:35,778 --> 00:49:36,779
It's stuck!

940
00:49:38,645 --> 00:49:39,812
Stuck?

941
00:49:39,946 --> 00:49:41,479
Ow! What the heck
are you doing?!

942
00:49:41,612 --> 00:49:44,011
<i>Be on alert for an intruder.</i>

943
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:45,612
Wait a minute.

944
00:49:45,744 --> 00:49:46,647
What's happening?

945
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:47,679
Shh. He's on to us.

946
00:49:47,811 --> 00:49:50,313
Hmm.

947
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,079
We are so dead.

948
00:49:52,213 --> 00:49:54,680
All right.
I know what's going on here.

949
00:49:54,811 --> 00:49:56,646
I'm picking up
what you're putting down.

950
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:58,312
Jerry, you getting
a load of this?

951
00:49:58,446 --> 00:50:00,012
Yeah, I think I am.

952
00:50:02,811 --> 00:50:05,978
Yeah, Jerry, I know exactly
what's going on.

953
00:50:07,578 --> 00:50:09,078
This right here...

954
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:12,613
is obviously...

955
00:50:12,746 --> 00:50:13,879
a new guy!

956
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:15,479
Yeah, impostors in a costume.

957
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,479
Wait. What?

958
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:17,813
- Oh.
- Uh.

959
00:50:17,946 --> 00:50:19,479
- Huh?
- Huh?

960
00:50:19,612 --> 00:50:22,012
Yeah! You're the new guard
for the east tower.

961
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,146
Yes.

962
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:28,612
Yes, I am.

963
00:50:28,745 --> 00:50:30,679
I knew it.

964
00:50:30,812 --> 00:50:32,179
Jerry, swipe
the new guy in.

965
00:50:32,313 --> 00:50:33,547
Okay.

966
00:50:35,012 --> 00:50:35,980
Thank you so much.

967
00:50:39,012 --> 00:50:40,479
Okay, guys, we're in.

968
00:50:40,612 --> 00:50:41,712
Oh, yeah.

969
00:50:41,846 --> 00:50:43,347
Woo! Woo-hoo!

970
00:50:43,479 --> 00:50:45,779
- We did it.
- Work it. Work it.

971
00:50:45,913 --> 00:50:47,811
- Okay.
- Wiggle the butt.

972
00:50:47,945 --> 00:50:49,479
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

973
00:50:49,613 --> 00:50:50,479
Huh?

974
00:50:55,279 --> 00:50:59,479
<i>♪ I'm on fire ♪</i>

975
00:50:59,613 --> 00:51:01,779
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go!

976
00:51:04,045 --> 00:51:06,346
<i>♪ Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby ♪</i>

977
00:51:11,413 --> 00:51:15,380
Get to the top
of the super-weapon. Check!

978
00:51:15,512 --> 00:51:16,778
Yay!

979
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,012
You did it.

980
00:51:21,746 --> 00:51:23,879
Okay, so how's it looking
down there?

981
00:51:24,012 --> 00:51:25,480
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
Do you see that?

982
00:51:25,613 --> 00:51:28,447
Oh, it's the super-weapon.

983
00:51:28,579 --> 00:51:31,546
No, the power supply
to the super-weapon.

984
00:51:31,678 --> 00:51:35,711
All we gotta do is get
down there and cut it.

985
00:51:35,846 --> 00:51:38,179
Okay, assuming we don't
get electrocuted,

986
00:51:38,312 --> 00:51:40,845
there are guards there,
there and there.

987
00:51:42,346 --> 00:51:43,945
And we don't have
enough rope to...

988
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,846
- Watch and learn.
- What? What are you doing?

989
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,112
He's not clipped in.

990
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:57,146
Red, are you crazy?

991
00:51:57,278 --> 00:51:59,844
Trust me.
I know what I'm do...

992
00:52:09,912 --> 00:52:12,779
So yeah. Rope wasn't
long enough.

993
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:14,644
I know that.
It wasn't supposed to be.

994
00:52:14,778 --> 00:52:15,846
That's part of my plan.

995
00:52:15,978 --> 00:52:17,479
Except I wanted to be

996
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:18,979
over on that side.

997
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:20,945
- Okay, but...
- Watch this!

998
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,980
Nope. No, no, no.

999
00:52:29,678 --> 00:52:31,179
Oh. Hello.

1000
00:52:32,513 --> 00:52:35,347
Hi. Now my plan
really starts.

1001
00:52:45,013 --> 00:52:46,546
- Hi again.
- I swung back

1002
00:52:46,679 --> 00:52:49,413
to tell you something,
but I forgot what it was. Bye.

1003
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:52,245
Got it. Got it.
Okay, there we go.

1004
00:52:52,379 --> 00:52:54,513
There we go.
Grip, grip, grip. Okay...

1005
00:52:56,446 --> 00:52:58,979
Huh? You hear something?

1006
00:53:00,279 --> 00:53:03,479
- So you want a push?
- Yes.

1007
00:53:07,212 --> 00:53:08,412
Ha, ha.

1008
00:53:08,545 --> 00:53:09,979
Hi. Oh, no.
Your feather!

1009
00:53:10,111 --> 00:53:11,678
The guards!

1010
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:14,346
Watch out.

1011
00:53:16,313 --> 00:53:18,180
Silver,
what are you doing?

1012
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:34,145
Oh, no.

1013
00:53:34,279 --> 00:53:35,545
Where's Red?

1014
00:53:35,677 --> 00:53:38,279
Hey, Silver.
Check it out.

1015
00:53:38,413 --> 00:53:41,612
This is how a hero
saves the world.

1016
00:53:41,746 --> 00:53:42,679
Ha, ha.

1017
00:53:45,179 --> 00:53:48,278
Oh, come on!
Nothing works around here!

1018
00:53:48,412 --> 00:53:49,945
Now we escape.

1019
00:53:56,544 --> 00:53:59,245
You two are coming with me.

1020
00:53:59,379 --> 00:54:01,644
- I... uh.
- Nice abs.

1021
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:02,812
I know.

1022
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:09,812
Okay, try zero-zero-zero-zero.

1023
00:54:10,979 --> 00:54:12,145
Try one-two-three-four.

1024
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:14,280
Now try four-three-two-one.

1025
00:54:14,413 --> 00:54:15,913
Try 1-800-OPEN.

1026
00:54:16,045 --> 00:54:18,479
I don't know.
Chuck, what's your birthday?

1027
00:54:18,611 --> 00:54:19,945
Nothing's working!

1028
00:54:21,279 --> 00:54:22,779
Oh, no. Someone's coming.

1029
00:54:22,911 --> 00:54:24,012
Quick. Hide.

1030
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:27,479
Ouch.

1031
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,712
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1032
00:54:30,845 --> 00:54:33,213
<i>There's an eagle nearby.
There's an eagle near...</i>

1033
00:54:36,578 --> 00:54:39,013
All right. You get started
on the lockdown sequence.

1034
00:54:39,145 --> 00:54:41,179
- I'm gonna hit the john.
- Yes, sir.

1035
00:54:44,146 --> 00:54:46,046
We gotta get that key card.

1036
00:55:01,745 --> 00:55:03,678
Okay, Courtney, get that card.

1037
00:55:08,145 --> 00:55:09,678
There's something in the way.

1038
00:55:11,578 --> 00:55:13,645
Chuck, what's going on
down there?

1039
00:55:16,045 --> 00:55:17,945
There's a divider in the way.

1040
00:55:22,245 --> 00:55:23,778
Maybe it's on the other side.

1041
00:55:30,445 --> 00:55:32,513
Okay, hold on.

1042
00:55:44,846 --> 00:55:46,312
Pretend to pee-pee.

1043
00:56:03,313 --> 00:56:04,679
Oh, no. He's leaving.

1044
00:56:04,811 --> 00:56:06,013
Chuck, get that card.

1045
00:56:07,211 --> 00:56:08,112
I got it.

1046
00:56:14,112 --> 00:56:15,178
Aah!

1047
00:56:32,812 --> 00:56:34,645
Yeah, I'm just gonna...

1048
00:56:34,779 --> 00:56:36,112
Boop.

1049
00:56:51,278 --> 00:56:52,479
We're home!

1050
00:56:52,611 --> 00:56:54,212
We're home, everybody.

1051
00:56:58,213 --> 00:57:00,078
Yay!

1052
00:57:00,213 --> 00:57:01,812
Woo!

1053
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:06,945
Oh, we missed you so much,
Bird Island.

1054
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:09,146
"Bird Island"?

1055
00:57:09,278 --> 00:57:11,411
This is Piggy Island,
sillies.

1056
00:57:11,545 --> 00:57:14,346
Bird Island
is way over there.

1057
00:57:22,478 --> 00:57:24,479
Ha, ha. We're in!

1058
00:57:24,611 --> 00:57:27,612
Oh, my goodness gravy.

1059
00:57:33,945 --> 00:57:35,212
I wanna see.

1060
00:57:35,345 --> 00:57:36,311
No. Hold on!

1061
00:57:36,444 --> 00:57:37,544
I just wanna see.

1062
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:38,978
We don't have time.

1063
00:57:43,344 --> 00:57:44,311
Uh-oh.

1064
00:57:59,845 --> 00:58:01,578
What? What's happening?

1065
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:04,179
I think he's challenging us
to a break-dance battle?

1066
00:58:11,278 --> 00:58:13,112
Aah!

1067
00:58:13,878 --> 00:58:15,812
Oh, it's on!

1068
00:58:18,646 --> 00:58:20,912
Woo! Whoa!

1069
00:58:22,378 --> 00:58:23,746
What's happening?

1070
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,445
Looks like a popping
and locking.

1071
00:58:25,578 --> 00:58:26,511
A little what?

1072
00:58:27,913 --> 00:58:29,445
Pop, pop, pop!

1073
00:58:29,579 --> 00:58:31,379
Ah!

1074
00:58:33,912 --> 00:58:35,477
Hey, handsome.

1075
00:58:35,611 --> 00:58:38,178
- Hey.
- Take those two

1076
00:58:38,311 --> 00:58:39,978
and put them on ice.

1077
00:58:41,578 --> 00:58:43,378
They got Red and my sister.
We gotta go.

1078
00:58:43,511 --> 00:58:44,677
But the super-weapon.

1079
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,545
That's my sister, mister.

1080
00:58:46,678 --> 00:58:48,012
And I'm gonna save her.

1081
00:58:48,146 --> 00:58:49,546
Chuck, slow down.

1082
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:51,147
Slow down. Stop!

1083
00:59:10,911 --> 00:59:12,279
Oh, yeah!

1084
00:59:17,979 --> 00:59:18,912
Hmm?

1085
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:23,779
Huh?

1086
00:59:23,913 --> 00:59:24,779
Hey.

1087
00:59:26,912 --> 00:59:28,578
Hey. You done?

1088
00:59:28,712 --> 00:59:30,079
- What happened?
- Oh, let's see.

1089
00:59:30,212 --> 00:59:32,278
Well, you got us captured
and trapped in ice

1090
00:59:32,411 --> 00:59:34,178
on top of giant pool toys.

1091
00:59:34,311 --> 00:59:35,278
Good job.

1092
00:59:35,412 --> 00:59:36,644
I just thought that

1093
00:59:36,778 --> 00:59:37,678
maybe if I could...

1094
00:59:37,812 --> 00:59:39,612
Stop me?

1095
00:59:39,746 --> 00:59:41,479
Yeah, you two lovebirds
just thought

1096
00:59:41,612 --> 00:59:43,378
y'all could sail over here
and stop me.

1097
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:44,846
- Lovebirds? No way.
- No, no, no.

1098
00:59:44,979 --> 00:59:46,479
We're barely,
like, friend birds.

1099
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:48,511
So typical.

1100
00:59:48,645 --> 00:59:52,113
Type-A male paired
with a strong female,

1101
00:59:52,246 --> 00:59:54,446
and you just can't stand it,
can you?

1102
00:59:54,579 --> 00:59:55,612
- Well, I...
- Let me guess.

1103
00:59:55,745 --> 00:59:57,812
You prefer to fly solo.

1104
00:59:57,946 --> 01:00:00,678
I have to save everybody

1105
01:00:00,812 --> 01:00:02,678
all by myself!

1106
01:00:02,812 --> 01:00:04,144
Just like a man.

1107
01:00:04,278 --> 01:00:06,678
Ooh, ouch.
That is kind of true, though.

1108
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:09,111
Maybe she was
a little clingy at times.

1109
01:00:09,245 --> 01:00:11,278
Maybe she gave you
that engagement ring

1110
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:13,079
a little bit too early.

1111
01:00:13,212 --> 01:00:15,245
I don't think
she's talking about us.

1112
01:00:15,379 --> 01:00:16,912
Maybe she's
talking about...

1113
01:00:17,046 --> 01:00:18,112
Mighty Eagle.

1114
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:21,277
- Debbie! Turn on the TV.
- Yes.

1115
01:00:21,411 --> 01:00:22,778
Okay...

1116
01:00:22,912 --> 01:00:24,745
It's the one
with the red button on top.

1117
01:00:24,879 --> 01:00:25,778
Okay...

1118
01:00:25,912 --> 01:00:27,244
Red, Debbie.

1119
01:00:27,378 --> 01:00:29,178
What I'm planning
to do is take

1120
01:00:29,312 --> 01:00:31,278
these little-bitty,
undeveloped islands,

1121
01:00:31,412 --> 01:00:35,478
and turn them into
my own personal paradise.

1122
01:00:35,611 --> 01:00:37,444
You're insane!

1123
01:00:37,578 --> 01:00:40,878
I am putting myself first.

1124
01:00:41,013 --> 01:00:43,479
Because you know what?
I worked hard for it,

1125
01:00:43,612 --> 01:00:45,479
and I deserve it.

1126
01:00:45,612 --> 01:00:48,012
All I gotta do is clear out
all these inhabitants.

1127
01:00:49,412 --> 01:00:51,312
You're a monster!

1128
01:00:51,444 --> 01:00:54,177
Glenn, show them what
I'm talking about.

1129
01:00:56,178 --> 01:00:59,212
Excuse me?
Are you getting smart with me right now?

1130
01:01:04,444 --> 01:01:08,478
♪ I can't believe we're
soaring Through the sky! Sky! ♪

1131
01:01:08,612 --> 01:01:10,846
♪ All thanks to our pig pals
They are cool ♪

1132
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,645
♪ Guys! Guys! ♪

1133
01:01:15,478 --> 01:01:17,179
What the heck
was that?

1134
01:01:17,311 --> 01:01:19,411
Piggy Island?

1135
01:01:20,711 --> 01:01:22,344
<i>Attention, everyone!</i>

1136
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:25,445
It is imperative that you all
run for your lives!

1137
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:33,344
Bird Island?

1138
01:01:33,478 --> 01:01:35,145
My mommy and daddy.

1139
01:01:36,546 --> 01:01:37,679
Huh?

1140
01:01:41,845 --> 01:01:43,778
Terence?
Where are the kids?

1141
01:01:45,311 --> 01:01:47,344
Where are the kids?

1142
01:01:49,145 --> 01:01:50,478
I don't understand.

1143
01:01:50,612 --> 01:01:52,880
I thought Red
was supposed to save us!

1144
01:01:58,511 --> 01:02:00,645
Oh, my gah...

1145
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,612
Huh?
Oh, my gah.

1146
01:02:08,512 --> 01:02:10,578
Oh! Ha-ha-ha!

1147
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:11,978
It actually worked.

1148
01:02:12,112 --> 01:02:13,111
Yes, yes, yes!

1149
01:02:13,245 --> 01:02:14,946
Those islands are filled

1150
01:02:15,078 --> 01:02:16,511
with innocent birds and pigs!

1151
01:02:16,646 --> 01:02:19,612
You all had the chance
to evacuate.

1152
01:02:19,746 --> 01:02:23,245
But for some reason,
you didn't.

1153
01:02:24,444 --> 01:02:26,278
So you are 100 percent sure

1154
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:28,178
we shouldn't evacuate?

1155
01:02:28,311 --> 01:02:31,410
I am sure.
No one needs to evacuate.

1156
01:02:31,545 --> 01:02:33,412
Everybody just stay calm.

1157
01:02:34,945 --> 01:02:36,479
Sorry. Ha-ha-ha.

1158
01:02:36,611 --> 01:02:39,277
Not sorry.
I'm truly not sorry.

1159
01:02:49,511 --> 01:02:51,978
Dodged that bullet.

1160
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:30,410
This is all my fault.

1161
01:03:30,544 --> 01:03:33,078
Red, it's not your fault.

1162
01:03:33,212 --> 01:03:36,479
No. It... It is my fault.

1163
01:03:36,611 --> 01:03:38,778
I put myself
before everyone else.

1164
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:43,779
I was afraid if I wasn't
a hero anymore,

1165
01:03:43,911 --> 01:03:44,979
they'd all stop...

1166
01:03:46,144 --> 01:03:47,678
They'd all stop liking me.

1167
01:03:47,812 --> 01:03:50,211
Oh, Red.
So you did all of this

1168
01:03:50,345 --> 01:03:52,943
because you were afraid
of not being liked?

1169
01:03:53,078 --> 01:03:54,712
I...

1170
01:03:56,111 --> 01:03:57,045
Yes.

1171
01:03:57,177 --> 01:03:59,511
My fellow eagles,

1172
01:03:59,644 --> 01:04:01,978
who's tired of living
in an icy wasteland?

1173
01:04:02,112 --> 01:04:03,645
We are!

1174
01:04:03,778 --> 01:04:05,010
What is she doing?

1175
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:06,279
Who is tired

1176
01:04:06,412 --> 01:04:07,678
of sipping
hot chocolate

1177
01:04:07,812 --> 01:04:09,878
and getting brain freeze?

1178
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:12,178
Aah! Me!

1179
01:04:15,711 --> 01:04:17,845
Who's tired of frozen dinners?

1180
01:04:17,978 --> 01:04:19,745
Whoa, frozen dinners?

1181
01:04:19,877 --> 01:04:21,344
Come on, Bomb,
let's go.

1182
01:04:21,477 --> 01:04:23,744
Who's tired of playing only

1183
01:04:23,878 --> 01:04:26,245
only Vanilla Ice,
Ice-T and Ice Cube?

1184
01:04:26,378 --> 01:04:28,644
I am.

1185
01:04:28,778 --> 01:04:32,978
Who wants to live worry-free
under a beautiful tropical sun?

1186
01:04:33,112 --> 01:04:34,978
Me! I want to be hot!

1187
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,511
I want it hot!

1188
01:04:37,646 --> 01:04:39,012
There's no turning back!

1189
01:04:39,144 --> 01:04:41,844
The future we deserve
is about to be ours!

1190
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:44,111
Glenn! Activate the weapon!

1191
01:04:44,244 --> 01:04:46,644
Start the countdown.

1192
01:04:46,778 --> 01:04:48,944
<i>Ten minutes to launch.</i>

1193
01:04:59,012 --> 01:05:01,379
All right, stand back.

1194
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:03,111
- Wait, did you hear that too?
- Bomb?

1195
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,177
What in the...?

1196
01:05:08,312 --> 01:05:11,845
- Really, guys?
- What? No. We weren't...

1197
01:05:11,977 --> 01:05:13,545
Uh. Yeah, they were.

1198
01:05:13,679 --> 01:05:16,110
Guys, why is that clock
counting backwards?

1199
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,612
- We've only got 10 minutes.
- It's now or never.

1200
01:05:18,744 --> 01:05:21,446
Pig-kind and bird-kind
are depending on us.

1201
01:05:21,578 --> 01:05:23,446
What are we gonna do, Red?

1202
01:05:23,578 --> 01:05:25,078
Well, I, uh..

1203
01:05:26,711 --> 01:05:28,278
I think...

1204
01:05:28,412 --> 01:05:31,445
in times like these,
we need someone who can lead.

1205
01:05:31,577 --> 01:05:33,344
We need a hero.

1206
01:05:33,479 --> 01:05:36,012
You know what we need?
We need Silver.

1207
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:37,345
Huh?

1208
01:05:39,544 --> 01:05:40,411
Oh.

1209
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:42,110
Got any ideas?

1210
01:05:42,244 --> 01:05:44,145
I've got a few, actually.

1211
01:05:46,445 --> 01:05:47,679
Okay.

1212
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:49,512
That's the heart
of the super-weapon,

1213
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:51,345
and if you look closely,
you can see

1214
01:05:51,478 --> 01:05:53,144
that it's powered
by air pressure.

1215
01:05:53,278 --> 01:05:54,843
Moisture around
a composite volcano

1216
01:05:54,977 --> 01:05:56,279
instantly vaporizes,

1217
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:58,545
sending a plume
of highly pressurized steam

1218
01:05:58,679 --> 01:06:00,012
to the surface.

1219
01:06:00,144 --> 01:06:02,679
That steam is contained
by the pressure chamber.

1220
01:06:02,810 --> 01:06:04,944
And that's the part
we need to destroy.

1221
01:06:05,078 --> 01:06:08,044
Only problem is,
it's surrounded by armed guards.

1222
01:06:08,178 --> 01:06:11,045
Bomb. Do you think you can
take out those guards?

1223
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:12,645
Some of them look
kind of tough.

1224
01:06:12,778 --> 01:06:14,045
It won't be easy.

1225
01:06:14,177 --> 01:06:15,546
Yeah, right.
Of course. Got it.

1226
01:06:15,678 --> 01:06:17,178
Great.
Chuck, I need you

1227
01:06:17,312 --> 01:06:19,112
to disable
the security cameras.

1228
01:06:19,245 --> 01:06:21,945
<i>There's a bunch,
so you'll have to work fast.</i>

1229
01:06:22,077 --> 01:06:24,144
Fast? Don't even worry
about it, sis.

1230
01:06:24,278 --> 01:06:26,144
Red, you and I
have to get inside

1231
01:06:26,278 --> 01:06:27,477
one of those ice balls.

1232
01:06:27,612 --> 01:06:29,412
Inside an ice ball?

1233
01:06:29,545 --> 01:06:31,010
I... Sure. Okay.

1234
01:06:31,144 --> 01:06:33,644
Leonard, Courtney, Garry,
do you see that giant lever

1235
01:06:33,777 --> 01:06:35,646
near the orange lava tube?

1236
01:06:35,777 --> 01:06:36,778
Copy that.

1237
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:38,244
I need you to pull it.

1238
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:39,479
That will create
a ramp so

1239
01:06:39,613 --> 01:06:41,478
when Red and I roll down
in the ice ball,

1240
01:06:41,611 --> 01:06:43,110
we'll be launched
through the air

1241
01:06:43,244 --> 01:06:44,345
at the perfect trajectory

1242
01:06:44,479 --> 01:06:45,845
to take out the super-weapon.

1243
01:06:45,977 --> 01:06:47,612
- <i>Got it?</i>
- <i>Now you're talking.</i>

1244
01:06:47,745 --> 01:06:48,943
Great plan, Silver.

1245
01:06:49,077 --> 01:06:50,444
Mama would be so proud.

1246
01:06:50,578 --> 01:06:52,978
Okay, everyone put
your wings and hooves in.

1247
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:57,211
Go, team!

1248
01:07:09,110 --> 01:07:11,545
Chuck, let us know when
you've disabled the cameras.

1249
01:07:11,678 --> 01:07:13,445
Okay. On it.

1250
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:19,044
Easy, boys.

1251
01:07:19,811 --> 01:07:21,078
Heh-heh-heh.

1252
01:07:30,245 --> 01:07:31,613
Heh.

1253
01:07:34,612 --> 01:07:36,245
Huh? Hey, Jerry.

1254
01:07:36,378 --> 01:07:37,579
Yeah?

1255
01:07:37,711 --> 01:07:39,811
- Come here. Look at this.
- What's up?

1256
01:07:41,910 --> 01:07:45,612
Uh... It says
everything's normal.

1257
01:07:51,844 --> 01:07:53,212
Jerry, are you seeing this?

1258
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:56,379
Uh... I don't see anything.

1259
01:07:56,512 --> 01:07:58,011
No, not that one.

1260
01:07:58,144 --> 01:07:59,312

1296
01:09:48,777 --> 01:09:50,910
Okay, Bomb, we are in position.

1297
01:09:51,044 --> 01:09:53,078

01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:12,345
Hi-yah!

1414
01:15:17,578 --> 01:15:20,112
Yes! We've reached 65 miles
per hour!

1415
01:15:20,244 --> 01:15:21,445
Fifteen seconds.

1416
01:15:21,578 --> 01:15:23,844
Ha, ha! Let's do this!

1417
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:27,478
<i>Fourteen, 13, 12...</i>

1418
01:15:27,611 --> 01:15:28,878
<i>11...</i>

1419
01:15:29,012 --> 01:15:31,044
- Ten. Nine.
- Leonard, it's now or never.

1420
01:15:31,177 --> 01:15:33,178
- Oh, no.
- Got to raise that ramp!

1421
01:15:33,311 --> 01:15:35,845
Seven. Six.

1422
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:37,510
Five.

1423
01:15:37,643 --> 01:15:40,411
Four. Three.

1424
01:15:40,545 --> 01:15:41,510
Two.

1425
01:15:41,644 --> 01:15:43,778
And one!

1426
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:46,244
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1427
01:15:46,376 --> 01:15:48,476
<i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1428
01:15:48,610 --> 01:15:51,410
- Yeah!
- <i>There's an eagle nearby.</i>

1429
01:15:58,243 --> 01:16:00,111
No!

1430
01:16:03,243 --> 01:16:04,744
Huh?

1431
01:16:04,878 --> 01:16:06,345
Huh?

1432
01:16:07,611 --> 01:16:10,778
That's my sister!

1433
01:16:22,410 --> 01:16:25,143
- It didn't work?
- I... I don't get it.

1434
01:16:25,278 --> 01:16:27,278
Of course it didn't work.

1435
01:16:30,577 --> 01:16:33,310
You must really love
your little islands

1436
01:16:33,444 --> 01:16:36,044
to risk your lives
trying to save them!

1437
01:16:37,476 --> 01:16:38,777
Well, guess what?

1438
01:16:38,912 --> 01:16:40,144
I don't care.

1439
01:16:40,277 --> 01:16:44,477
Because this right here
is ice-cold, baby.

1440
01:16:46,778 --> 01:16:47,778
No!

1441
01:16:47,911 --> 01:16:49,178
- Zeta!
- What?

1442
01:16:49,311 --> 01:16:51,476
Wait!

1443
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,477
- What? What...?
- Mighty Eagle!

1444
01:16:53,611 --> 01:16:54,612
Yeah!

1445
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:03,777
I'm the cause of all this.

1446
01:17:03,910 --> 01:17:07,276
I ran out on you
on our wedding day.

1447
01:17:07,410 --> 01:17:11,277
And ever since then,
you've been tormented inside.

1448
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:13,443
Now? This is when you
choose to do this?

1449
01:17:13,577 --> 01:17:15,344
So take me!

1450
01:17:15,477 --> 01:17:17,945
Not these islands.

1451
01:17:18,078 --> 01:17:20,978
You have got some
flipping nerve!

1452
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:22,310
I know!

1453
01:17:22,444 --> 01:17:24,878
I ripped your heartstrings
right out.

1454
01:17:25,010 --> 01:17:27,310
- That's it. Super String.
- What?

1455
01:17:27,444 --> 01:17:30,543
...has been burning a hole
in your sanity!

1456
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:33,011
- Set yourself free...
- Okay, I'm seeing it.

1457
01:17:33,143 --> 01:17:34,811
Yeah.

1458
01:17:34,945 --> 01:17:38,811
- Go ahead. Do your worst to me.
- Chuck.

1459
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:39,910
I deserve it.

1460
01:17:42,311 --> 01:17:44,012
You think this
is about you, Ethan?

1461
01:17:44,144 --> 01:17:45,310
Ethan?

1462
01:17:45,443 --> 01:17:49,077
Oh, that is so hilarious
/ embarrassing

1463
01:17:49,211 --> 01:17:52,844
/ I hadn't thought about
your fat butt in 20 years.

1464
01:17:52,977 --> 01:17:53,944
Wait, what?

1465
01:17:54,077 --> 01:17:55,478
You are a lazy,

1466
01:17:55,611 --> 01:17:58,577
uncoordinated,
fish-eyed fool.

1467
01:17:58,711 --> 01:18:00,978
You ain't worth the salt
in your bread.

1468
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:03,111
You are nothing to me!
You are nothing!

1469
01:18:03,245 --> 01:18:04,612
I don't think
about you at all.

1470
01:18:04,745 --> 01:18:06,311
I don't think about
your stinking feet.

1471
01:18:06,444 --> 01:18:08,177
I don't think about
your rusty hands.

1472
01:18:08,310 --> 01:18:10,278
I don't think about
your rusty elbows...

1473
01:18:10,410 --> 01:18:12,944
Wait, so you have
or you haven't thought about me?

1474
01:18:13,076 --> 01:18:14,444
News flash, bro:

1475
01:18:14,578 --> 01:18:17,109
I am over you,
I'm over this place,

1476
01:18:17,243 --> 01:18:19,644
and I am ready to get
that upgrade situation

1477
01:18:19,778 --> 01:18:21,544
going for me
and my daughter.

1478
01:18:21,678 --> 01:18:22,545
Hey.

1479
01:18:24,610 --> 01:18:26,710
Well, our daughter.

1480
01:18:26,844 --> 01:18:27,710
What?

1481
01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:35,344
- That's my dad?
- I have a daughter?

1482
01:18:35,478 --> 01:18:37,178
Yes, you do!

1483
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:41,445
And I raised her all by myself
in this icy wasteland.

1484
01:18:41,578 --> 01:18:44,544
But now I'm gonna be
sipping piña coladas

1485
01:18:44,678 --> 01:18:46,778
on those warm tropical islands

1486
01:18:46,910 --> 01:18:49,178
like I deserve to!

1487
01:18:52,476 --> 01:18:54,011
- Stop!
- Oh, no.

1488
01:19:00,343 --> 01:19:01,278
Huh?

1489
01:19:03,011 --> 01:19:03,945
- It's working!
- Yes!

1490
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:07,977
Oh, no.

1491
01:19:09,478 --> 01:19:10,510
Gotcha!

1492
01:19:16,111 --> 01:19:17,143
You can do it!

1493
01:19:17,278 --> 01:19:19,178
Hold on to that string!

1494
01:19:20,143 --> 01:19:21,076
The hatchlings.

1495
01:19:21,209 --> 01:19:23,244
Oh, no! They're in trouble!

1496
01:19:35,110 --> 01:19:36,011
Jump!

1497
01:19:41,912 --> 01:19:44,511
- Everyone...
- Run!

1498
01:19:44,644 --> 01:19:45,578
Let's go!

1499
01:19:45,712 --> 01:19:46,912
No, no, wait.

1500
01:19:47,044 --> 01:19:48,445
This is not happening.

1501
01:19:55,710 --> 01:19:56,611
Gotcha!

1502
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:04,077
- I'm freaking out!
- Me too!

1503
01:20:32,645 --> 01:20:33,944
- We did it.
- We did it.

1504
01:20:35,577 --> 01:20:36,476
Debbie?

1505
01:20:36,611 --> 01:20:38,544
Where is she? Where's Debbie?

1506
01:20:38,677 --> 01:20:40,042
Debbie?

1507
01:20:44,344 --> 01:20:45,978
Debbie, no.

1508
01:20:55,477 --> 01:20:57,178
What have I done?

1509
01:20:58,744 --> 01:21:01,144
Oh, Debbie.

1510
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:10,811
Are you okay?

1511
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:13,711
Sweetie?

1512
01:21:13,845 --> 01:21:15,111
Honey pie?

1513
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:17,311
Love of the last
one minute of my life?

1514
01:21:20,478 --> 01:21:21,611
Dad?

1515
01:21:21,744 --> 01:21:23,011
Yes.

1516
01:21:24,477 --> 01:21:26,244
You are so strong!

1517
01:21:26,377 --> 01:21:27,944
He saved my life!

1518
01:21:28,077 --> 01:21:29,577
Oh, Debbie.

1519
01:21:32,310 --> 01:21:34,510
Mom, can we keep him?

1520
01:21:34,644 --> 01:21:35,744
Please?

1521
01:21:35,877 --> 01:21:37,345
Oh, I, uh...

1522
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:40,477
Wait. Wait.

1523
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:42,745
Before you answer,
you should see something.

1524
01:21:45,310 --> 01:21:46,645
Wait, wait, wait.

1525
01:21:49,043 --> 01:21:50,076
Mm-hmm.

1526
01:21:50,210 --> 01:21:52,644

1536
01:22:18,411 --> 01:22:21,678
I've never been

1537
01:22:21,809 --> 01:22:23,810
Oh, okay,
who's getting married again?

1538
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:28,210
Oh, Terence, this is like our
wedding but expensive. Ha, ha.

1539
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:31,176
Flowers for you,
flowers for you.

1540
01:22:31,309 --> 01:22:32,610
Ladies and gentlemen,

1541
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:34,311
birds and pigs,

1542
01:22:34,444 --> 01:22:38,176
we are gathered here today
because of these two characters.

1543
01:22:38,311 --> 01:22:41,611
Not only because they're being
joined in holy matrimony,

1544
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:44,944
but also because one of them
tried to destroy our islands

1545
01:22:45,076 --> 01:22:47,010
for her own selfish reasons.

1546
01:22:47,144 --> 01:22:48,211
Guess who.

1547
01:22:48,344 --> 01:22:50,611
Oh, it's such
a beautiful wedding.

1548
01:22:50,745 --> 01:22:52,044
It really is.

1549
01:22:52,176 --> 01:22:54,977
But Mighty Eagle swooped
in at the last second

1550
01:22:55,111 --> 01:22:57,444
and got all the credit
for stopping her.

1551
01:22:57,578 --> 01:22:59,011
Yes, you did, baby.

1552
01:22:59,143 --> 01:23:00,776
I love you.

1553
01:23:00,909 --> 01:23:02,277
Wrap it up.

1554
01:23:02,411 --> 01:23:05,444
I now pronounce you
eagle and husband.

1555
01:23:05,578 --> 01:23:08,177
- You may now kiss the...
- Come here, you.

1556
01:23:08,311 --> 01:23:09,511
Ugh!

1557
01:23:09,643 --> 01:23:11,477
All right.
Get it, Mighty Eagle.

1558
01:23:11,611 --> 01:23:12,843
Oh, that is disgusting!

1559
01:23:12,977 --> 01:23:15,144
Go, Zeta! Go, Dad!

1560
01:23:15,277 --> 01:23:16,544
Attention!

1561
01:23:16,678 --> 01:23:18,944
Attention, everybody.
Eyes on me. Hi.

1562
01:23:19,077 --> 01:23:20,278
Hi. Look up here.

1563
01:23:20,411 --> 01:23:22,678
I would like to propose a toast

1564
01:23:22,810 --> 01:23:25,844
to the bird who made
all of this possible.

1565
01:23:27,211 --> 01:23:29,443
Our hero, Red.

1566
01:23:29,577 --> 01:23:31,444
- Give it up for Red!
- Yeah!

1567
01:23:31,578 --> 01:23:34,277
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1568
01:23:34,411 --> 01:23:35,944
You're our hero, Red!

1569
01:23:36,078 --> 01:23:37,278
<i>Red! Red! Red!</i>

1570
01:23:37,411 --> 01:23:39,678
Oh. Easy, guys.

1571
01:23:39,810 --> 01:23:41,477
Hollow bones.
I've got hollow bones.

1572
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,276
- Who loves you, Red?
- Yeah, Red!

1573
01:23:43,411 --> 01:23:46,411
Oh, wow. I mean, thanks, guys.
I... Thank you.

1574
01:23:46,545 --> 01:23:49,578
Speech, speech, speech!

1575
01:23:56,044 --> 01:23:58,078
Looks like they still
love you, Red.

1576
01:23:59,377 --> 01:24:02,676
Um, okay, well,
you know, I'm...

1577
01:24:02,811 --> 01:24:05,944
I'm honored, everybody.
Really, I... And I just, um...

1578
01:24:11,444 --> 01:24:13,411
Give me two seconds.
I'll be right back.

1579
01:24:13,545 --> 01:24:17,144
Woo! Good speech! Yeah!

1580
01:24:17,278 --> 01:24:18,943
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

1581
01:24:19,076 --> 01:24:21,743
Excuse me. I'm just trying
to squeeze through here.

1582
01:24:21,876 --> 01:24:23,643
Hey, hey, hey! Silver!

1583
01:24:23,776 --> 01:24:24,776
Huh?

1584
01:24:32,310 --> 01:24:35,511
Wow. I, um...
Thank you, guys.

1585
01:24:35,644 --> 01:24:38,377
Thank you for this. And for
all the support and love.

1586
01:24:38,511 --> 01:24:41,710
You know, it means...
Well, it means everything to me.

1587
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:45,111
But, um, I don't deserve it.

1588
01:24:45,243 --> 01:24:46,344
She does.

1589
01:24:46,477 --> 01:24:47,643
What just happened?

1590
01:24:47,776 --> 01:24:49,978
Is that the nerd
from our physics class?

1591
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:52,611
This is the real hero
right here.

1592
01:24:52,743 --> 01:24:54,010
Silver is the one
who came up

1593
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,877
with the plan
to stop the super-weapon

1594
01:24:56,009 --> 01:24:59,378
and ultimately saved
all our lives.

1595
01:25:00,810 --> 01:25:03,710
Red, I didn't do this
all on my own.

1596
01:25:03,843 --> 01:25:06,378
Right. Because we're a team.

1597
01:25:07,943 --> 01:25:09,110
We couldn't have
done anything without

1598
01:25:09,244 --> 01:25:10,710
Chuck and Bomb,

1599
01:25:10,844 --> 01:25:13,111
- or Courtney and Garry.
- Thank you.

1600
01:25:13,244 --> 01:25:15,278
Or Leonard.
Actually, we probably

1601
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:16,876
could've done it
without Leonard.

1602
01:25:17,009 --> 01:25:17,976
Let's be honest, huh?

1603
01:25:18,110 --> 01:25:19,209
Leonard's the man!

1604
01:25:19,343 --> 01:25:20,943
I did everything!
I got the sub!

1605
01:25:21,076 --> 01:25:22,310
And even Mighty Eagle.

1606
01:25:22,443 --> 01:25:24,043
- So handsome.
- Ethan!

1607
01:25:24,176 --> 01:25:26,376
And last,
but certainly not least,

1608
01:25:26,510 --> 01:25:28,144
those adorable hatchlings.

1609
01:25:29,810 --> 01:25:33,110
We are strongest
when we all band together.

1610
01:25:33,244 --> 01:25:34,643
Just like Super String.

1611
01:25:34,777 --> 01:25:37,911
- Let's hear it for Silver!
- Yes!

1612
01:25:38,043 --> 01:25:40,610
I want to be an engineer.

1613
01:25:40,744 --> 01:25:43,611
- All right! Yeah, Silver!
- We love you, Silver!

1614
01:25:43,744 --> 01:25:45,610
- Okay, Garry, now.
- On it.

1615
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:49,644
Oh, my gosh!

1616
01:25:49,776 --> 01:25:51,743
- We're famous!
- Look at that.

1617
01:25:51,876 --> 01:25:53,910
Oh, look! It's me!

1618
01:25:54,043 --> 01:25:56,676
You see, these guys
are the real heroes.

1619
01:25:56,809 --> 01:26:00,110
They're the ones who deserve
your love, not me.

1620
01:26:02,410 --> 01:26:04,276
We love you even
more now, Red!

1621
01:26:04,410 --> 01:26:06,411
Yeah, Red! We love you!

1622
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:10,111
See? You're not
in this alone.

1623
01:26:10,243 --> 01:26:13,410
I'm married now. Let's party,
y'all! I's married!

1624
01:26:21,642 --> 01:26:23,911
Debbie,
get away from the punch bowl, girl!

1625
01:26:24,044 --> 01:26:26,445
Come over here
and dance with your mama!

1626
01:26:28,709 --> 01:26:30,477
Mm-mm!

1627
01:26:32,911 --> 01:26:34,811
- Hey, y'all!
- Mom, watch this!

1628
01:26:34,944 --> 01:26:37,344
Oh, yeah! Hey,
where's Red and Silver?

1629
01:26:37,478 --> 01:26:40,511
<i>♪ The only one for me
Is you ♪</i>

1630
01:26:40,643 --> 01:26:43,177
- Okay, worms or birdseed?
- Huh?

1631
01:26:43,310 --> 01:26:45,377
Kidding.
I know it's toast.

1632
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:46,943
Ha, ha. Toast.

1633
01:26:47,076 --> 01:26:48,877
You know, I was actually
being sarcastic

1634
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:50,544
when I said that
was my favorite,

1635
01:26:50,677 --> 01:26:51,843
just for the record.

1636
01:26:51,976 --> 01:26:53,609
What? You?

1637
01:26:53,742 --> 01:26:55,043
Sarcastic?

1638
01:26:55,178 --> 01:26:56,843
- No way.
- I see what you're doing.

1639
01:26:56,976 --> 01:26:59,010
- Okay.
- Maybe you can teach me sometime.

1640
01:26:59,144 --> 01:27:01,777
Maybe I will, when you're not
too busy saving the world.

1641
01:27:01,909 --> 01:27:04,843
You know, I actually
just finished doing that,

1642
01:27:04,977 --> 01:27:06,677
so I'm pretty free.

1643
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:09,277
Oh, no way.
Because I'm pretty free too.

1644
01:27:09,410 --> 01:27:11,843
Well, I don't have anything
to do either!

1645
01:27:11,978 --> 01:27:13,977
Wait a minute.
What's that sound?

1646
01:27:14,111 --> 01:27:16,544
Tickle Train?
Coming to Third Wheel Station!

1647
01:27:16,676 --> 01:27:17,811
Chuck, no!

1648
01:27:17,943 --> 01:27:21,443
Jinx, jinx, jinx!

1649
01:27:37,244 --> 01:27:39,344
Laugh it up, everybody.

1650
01:27:39,476 --> 01:27:41,642
Ha-ha-ha.

1651
01:27:41,776 --> 01:27:44,010
No one can stop me.

1652
01:27:44,143 --> 01:27:46,610
I'll stop you, Zeta.

1653
01:27:46,743 --> 01:27:47,910
Ha-ha-ha.

1654
01:27:48,044 --> 01:27:50,076
Well, you can't stop me from...

1655
01:27:50,209 --> 01:27:52,143
showing you how cute
my little sisters are

1656
01:27:52,277 --> 01:27:54,009
when they're sleeping.

1657
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:55,676
Yay!

1658
01:28:07,610 --> 01:28:10,411
Aw, they're so cute.

1659
01:28:10,544 --> 01:28:13,178
I kind of thought
they'd be hatched by now.

1660
01:28:14,977 --> 01:28:16,442
They're hatching!

1661
01:28:16,576 --> 01:28:18,144
Yay!

1662
01:28:18,276 --> 01:28:19,509
Here they come!

1663
01:28:19,643 --> 01:28:21,577
Oh, my gosh! I see one!

1664
01:28:26,810 --> 01:28:27,777
Mama!

1665
01:28:28,576 --> 01:28:29,676
Uh-oh.

1666
01:28:47,477 --> 01:28:48,944
Can I help you?

1667
01:28:51,109 --> 01:28:53,378
Oh. Sorry.

1668
01:29:04,077 --> 01:29:05,010
Mama?

1669
01:29:10,177 --> 01:29:11,043
Hi.

1670
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:13,876
My baby sisters!

1671
01:29:14,009 --> 01:29:15,110
Yay!

1672
01:29:21,977 --> 01:29:23,210
Bye.

1673
01:29:26,643 --> 01:29:28,843
Mama!

1674
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,442
Oh, baby sisters.

1675
01:29:32,576 --> 01:29:34,477
We love you so much.

1676
01:29:34,609 --> 01:29:36,110
We should take
good care of them

1677
01:29:36,244 --> 01:29:38,043
and never let them
out of our sights.

1678
01:29:38,177 --> 01:29:41,575
Yeah. We'll never let them
out of our sights.

1679
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:42,610
Huh?

1680
01:29:45,910 --> 01:29:47,177
Bye-bye.
