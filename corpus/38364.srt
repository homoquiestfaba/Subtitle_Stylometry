1
00:00:56,368 --> 00:00:59,701
Screams of the victim deaden his pain.

2
00:00:59,972 --> 00:01:03,373
The act of killing
makes him feel intensely alive.

3
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:06,203
What he feels next is not guilt...

4
00:01:06,311 --> 00:01:08,006
...but disappointment.

5
00:01:08,213 --> 00:01:10,545
It was not as wonderful as he'd hoped.

6
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:13,617
Maybe next time, it will be perfect.

7
00:01:14,152 --> 00:01:17,246
And as his determination builds
to take another life...

8
00:01:17,356 --> 00:01:19,847
...he plans, in obsessive detail...

9
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:21,856
...what props he'll bring...

10
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:24,020
...what knots he'll tie.

11
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:27,724
Let me ask you something.

12
00:01:27,833 --> 00:01:29,232
What turns you on?

13
00:01:29,501 --> 00:01:32,493
What really does it for you?
ls it a great body?

14
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:35,802
ls it a nice smile? ls it beautiful legs?

15
00:01:36,008 --> 00:01:41,207
What turns on a serial killer is
the suffering and death of a human being.

16
00:01:41,413 --> 00:01:44,143
Now, l'd like to ask you guys a favor.

17
00:01:44,282 --> 00:01:47,376
lf you could all stand up,
all the men in the room....

18
00:01:47,452 --> 00:01:49,420
Please indulge me.

19
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:56,427
Come on, it's only fair,
after all the time you ogled us.

20
00:01:56,595 --> 00:02:00,429
Now, would everybody under 20
and over 35 have a seat.

21
00:02:00,565 --> 00:02:04,797
lf you are of Asian or African-American
descent, you may sit down.

22
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:07,905
Kenny, turn that light on, please...

23
00:02:07,973 --> 00:02:10,771
...so we can get a good look at these guys.

24
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:13,174
Ladies, what do you see?

25
00:02:13,945 --> 00:02:16,277
Some pretty cute guys, don't you think?

26
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:19,943
lf one of these fellas
asked you out for a drink, you'd go.

27
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,281
Let me tell you...

28
00:02:22,421 --> 00:02:26,323
...nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...

29
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,153
...age 20 to 35...

30
00:02:28,226 --> 00:02:30,091
...just like these.

31
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:34,131
Albert DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono...

32
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:36,666
...Berkowitz, Dahmer, Ted Bundy.

33
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,861
They were quiet, unassuming...

34
00:02:38,937 --> 00:02:40,461
...even nice.

35
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,133
They had jobs.
They made decent neighbors.

36
00:02:43,241 --> 00:02:45,368
Their victims trusted them.

37
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:46,875
The FBl estimates...

38
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:50,210
...there could be
as many as 35 serial killers...

39
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:53,317
...cruising for victims, even as l speak.

40
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,984
Guys, sit down. You're scaring me.

41
00:02:57,889 --> 00:02:59,083
Serial killers...

42
00:02:59,157 --> 00:03:01,455
...are not a 20th-century invention...

43
00:03:01,526 --> 00:03:04,222
...but we are spawning them
in greater numbers.

44
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:08,089
The state of Florida
spent almost $8 million...

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,895
...to electrocute Ted--

46
00:03:11,336 --> 00:03:13,497
You're dead.

47
00:03:20,078 --> 00:03:21,136
Sorry.

48
00:03:22,547 --> 00:03:26,574
The state of Florida spent $8 million
to electrocute Ted Bundy.

49
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:30,916
Wouldn't that money have been
better spent keeping him in jail...

50
00:03:31,089 --> 00:03:33,649
...subject to scientific scrutiny?

51
00:03:33,925 --> 00:03:38,862
lsn't our best hope to try to identify
the Ted Bundys of the future...

52
00:03:39,131 --> 00:03:40,928
...before they kill?

53
00:03:42,267 --> 00:03:43,427
Thank you.

54
00:03:49,407 --> 00:03:51,238
Don't park next to vans.

55
00:03:51,309 --> 00:03:52,469
Thanks for coming.

56
00:03:52,544 --> 00:03:54,409
l'm hitting the ladies' room.

57
00:03:54,546 --> 00:03:57,515
Since she's using the ladies' room,
l'll use the men's room.

58
00:03:57,582 --> 00:04:00,380
-Thanks for your help, Tom.
-Anytime.

59
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,123
Hello.

60
00:04:16,902 --> 00:04:18,199
Sorry, ma'am.

61
00:04:19,304 --> 00:04:21,135
Doc, it's all yours.

62
00:05:26,872 --> 00:05:28,362
Dr. Hudson?

63
00:05:31,576 --> 00:05:32,975
Hello?

64
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:45,486
Come out with your hands up.

65
00:05:48,293 --> 00:05:50,488
l'm not going to ask you--

66
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:01,165
What are you doing with my gun?

67
00:06:01,806 --> 00:06:03,569
How'd you get my gun?

68
00:06:03,675 --> 00:06:08,009
What are you doing in the ladies' room?
Are you spying on little girls?

69
00:06:10,849 --> 00:06:13,010
l'll tell you something right now.

70
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:15,945
Don't she look pretty up there, Officer?

71
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:18,251
You know what l want to know?

72
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:21,051
Help me out on this,
since you're the expert.

73
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:23,251
How would a fartknocker like me...

74
00:06:23,328 --> 00:06:26,126
...take out a dumb guy like this?

75
00:06:26,231 --> 00:06:27,823
Would you stick him...

76
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,291
...or would you shoot him?

77
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:32,029
Stick him or shoot him?

78
00:06:32,837 --> 00:06:36,364
l can't decide,
but l think l'll just go ahead and do both.

79
00:06:48,286 --> 00:06:50,777
You bloodied up my knife, you dog.

80
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:52,847
l hate cops.

81
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:56,292
Hey, Dr. Hudson.

82
00:06:58,797 --> 00:07:01,732
What do you say me and you
have a little fun?

83
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,657
John Adams....

84
00:07:32,797 --> 00:07:34,025
Adams...

85
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,689
...Jefferson...

86
00:07:37,202 --> 00:07:39,466
...James Monroe, James Madison...

87
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,870
...John Quincy Adams.

88
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:44,706
Andy!

89
00:07:46,144 --> 00:07:47,406
Andy!

90
00:07:53,685 --> 00:07:55,653
John Quincy Adams.

91
00:07:56,621 --> 00:07:58,384
Andrew Jackson.

92
00:08:00,025 --> 00:08:01,583
Martin Van Buren.

93
00:08:01,726 --> 00:08:03,990
Wait a minute. This is so stupid.

94
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,663
Calvin Coolidge.

95
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,144
l got you beat.

96
00:09:38,923 --> 00:09:40,288
Bye, Kate.

97
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,399
Police! Freeze!

98
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:16,319
The good news is, you're still alive.

99
00:11:17,522 --> 00:11:19,353
You see a downside to that?

100
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:21,517
This is pretty remedial stuff.

101
00:11:21,693 --> 00:11:23,854
Let's review the scenario.

102
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:27,523
Didn't anyone at the Academy
teach you to shoot conservatively?

103
00:11:28,866 --> 00:11:30,026
You shredded him.

104
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,693
l'm an intuitive cop...

105
00:11:31,769 --> 00:11:33,703
...with poor impulse control.

106
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:36,768
Let's assume you didn't mow down
a 75-year-old man...

107
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:39,810
...who couldn't hear your warning
because he's deaf.

108
00:11:40,044 --> 00:11:44,105
Let's say you greased the guy
while he was trying to surrender.

109
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:48,410
Now, you're on leave pending an inquiry.

110
00:11:48,553 --> 00:11:51,181
Friends wonder if you're a psychopath.
And on top...

111
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:55,886
...the guy's junkie wife's lawyer slams
a wrongful death action up your tail.

112
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,588
All right, smart-ass, let's see how you do.

113
00:12:04,869 --> 00:12:06,860
The shoulder of his gun hand's exposed.

114
00:12:06,938 --> 00:12:10,772
You hit the brachial nerve,
he drops the gun. You read him his rights.

115
00:12:10,908 --> 00:12:15,072
Plus, you haven't taken a human life
so your karma's still okay.

116
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:16,975
You hungry? l'm starving.

117
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:20,279
-Aren't you going to answer that?
-No, it's probably not important.

118
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,750
She thinks it is.

119
00:12:21,853 --> 00:12:24,185
How about Moroccan? You like couscous?

120
00:12:24,255 --> 00:12:26,655
Don't you want to know which one it is?

121
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,084
Hello?

122
00:12:30,428 --> 00:12:34,262
You must have mental telepathy.
l was just about to call you.

123
00:12:34,766 --> 00:12:38,133
The usual.
Long days making sure justice prevails.

124
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:53,109
10390 Mariposa?

125
00:13:53,611 --> 00:13:56,273
Scaffolding on the north and west sides
of the building.

126
00:13:56,347 --> 00:13:58,781
Great. The Mouth is here.

127
00:13:58,883 --> 00:14:00,475
You can end her career.

128
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,918
Pop her brachial nerve,
she'll drop the microphone.

129
00:14:05,256 --> 00:14:06,746
lt's a thought.

130
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:22,272
-How are you?
-Fine, thanks.

131
00:14:22,373 --> 00:14:26,935
Can you confirm that this latest murder
fits the same pattern as the other two?

132
00:14:27,044 --> 00:14:29,342
We just got here. l'm not prepared to--

133
00:14:29,414 --> 00:14:33,111
ls there a serial killer stalking
the streets of San Francisco?

134
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:35,550
Excuse me. l'm a member of the press.

135
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:36,985
Hey, MJ, all done.

136
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:41,422
Hey, Jim. Can you grab some overalls
from the crowd, some nice clear faces?

137
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:43,550
l'll make them say ''cheese.''

138
00:14:43,961 --> 00:14:45,622
Landlady found her.

139
00:14:45,797 --> 00:14:47,697
Front door was open. She tried the bell.

140
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:51,064
The tenant didn't answer,
so she went inside and found the body.

141
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,901
She used the telephone to dial 91 1,
otherwise touched nothing.

142
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:57,406
-You're thinking robbery?
-Doesn't look like it.

143
00:14:57,475 --> 00:15:00,342
lt's all yours, kids.
l'll take care of the Mouth.

144
00:15:00,445 --> 00:15:01,844
Good morning, sir.

145
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:05,110
-With this scaffolding, we should call--
-l'll call the contractor.

146
00:15:05,183 --> 00:15:06,582
Take this.

147
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:10,318
Good morning.

148
00:15:12,557 --> 00:15:14,457
Were you first on the scene?

149
00:15:15,426 --> 00:15:16,984
That the landlady?

150
00:15:17,962 --> 00:15:19,259
Thanks.

151
00:15:19,831 --> 00:15:21,992
''Johnson.'' What's the first part?

152
00:15:22,066 --> 00:15:23,829
You touch anything, Mike?

153
00:15:24,001 --> 00:15:27,266
l don't want to get excited
about good latents that are yours.

154
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:29,670
-No, l didn't.
-You didn't?

155
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:35,972
She usually goes jogging in the morning,
to the Delores Park.

156
00:16:13,184 --> 00:16:14,412
This one.

157
00:16:44,448 --> 00:16:45,915
Pretty wild.

158
00:16:46,884 --> 00:16:48,249
How you doing?

159
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,683
Got an estimate for me?

160
00:16:51,055 --> 00:16:52,818
About eight hours.

161
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,656
l'm seeing ligature marks, petechiae.

162
00:16:56,727 --> 00:16:58,217
Strangled, huh?

163
00:16:58,462 --> 00:17:00,259
Same as the others.

164
00:17:00,932 --> 00:17:03,093
Bag all the stuff on the bedside table?

165
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,898
Thanks, Bill. Excellent.
That's the only one l need.

166
00:17:16,147 --> 00:17:17,978
Were you the first one here?

167
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:19,448
Did you touch anything?

168
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:20,848
No, ma'am.

169
00:17:22,787 --> 00:17:24,220
What's wrong?

170
00:17:24,355 --> 00:17:25,617
Nothing.

171
00:17:26,123 --> 00:17:30,219
lf you're holding out on me,
l'll get it out of you. You know l will.

172
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:35,530
There was a stocking around her neck
when l found her.

173
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,861
l don't know what happened to it.

174
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:42,137
Who else was in there
before the CSl came?

175
00:17:43,908 --> 00:17:45,398
Lieutenant Quinn.

176
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,305
That's all right, then.

177
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,741
Thanks, Mike.

178
00:17:49,814 --> 00:17:54,774
Celebrating 25 years of the spirit
of the 60s in San Francisco...

179
00:17:55,019 --> 00:17:58,648
...the Festival of Love got underway today
in Golden Gate Park.

180
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:01,920
Why did you remove evidence from the--

181
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:03,926
l want to hear this.

182
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,792
In Potrero Hill...

183
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:10,331
...homicide detectives discovered
yet another grisly murder today.

184
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:14,437
Police would not comment, but
informed sources inside the Department...

185
00:18:14,505 --> 00:18:16,268
...tell us this latest death...

186
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:21,334
...could be the work of the same killer
responsible for the deaths of two women.

187
00:18:21,612 --> 00:18:24,103
Susan Schiffer, Potrero Hill.

188
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:25,705
You messed with the scene.

189
00:18:25,783 --> 00:18:29,583
Someone around here can't keep
his yap shut, and l'm finding out who.

190
00:18:29,687 --> 00:18:31,382
What did you do with the stocking?

191
00:18:31,455 --> 00:18:32,820
l tagged it.

192
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:36,348
l don't want some blabbermouth
leaking the MO to her...

193
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:40,453
...so she can tell everyone,
leaving us nothing to play.

194
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,198
Am l in charge of this or not?

195
00:18:45,102 --> 00:18:46,501
Why are you so prickly?

196
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,404
l ought to be the one deciding
what evidence to sequester.

197
00:18:50,574 --> 00:18:52,701
All right, lnspector.

198
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,602
Which evidence on this case
would you like to sequester?

199
00:18:56,681 --> 00:19:00,014
-The stocking around the neck.
-The stocking around the neck.

200
00:19:00,551 --> 00:19:02,883
You're one pushy broad, MJ.

201
00:19:02,953 --> 00:19:05,148
l'll take that as a compliment, sir.

202
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:12,724
l didn't say serial killer,
you didn't say serial killer.

203
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:27,001
For Christ's sake.

204
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,410
Again.

205
00:20:01,011 --> 00:20:02,535
George Washington.

206
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:04,608
John Adams.

207
00:20:05,449 --> 00:20:06,939
Thomas Jefferson.

208
00:20:07,184 --> 00:20:08,879
James Madison.

209
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,117
James Monroe.

210
00:20:14,825 --> 00:20:16,656
Oh, come on.

211
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:19,953
John Quincy Adams.

212
00:20:20,698 --> 00:20:22,563
Martin Van Buren.

213
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:45,821
ldiots!

214
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,891
You followed the girl home. Then what?

215
00:20:53,497 --> 00:20:54,794
l killed her.

216
00:20:56,801 --> 00:20:58,393
Where did you do that?

217
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:01,231
lt was in the bathtub.

218
00:21:03,908 --> 00:21:05,500
Why did you do that?

219
00:21:07,378 --> 00:21:08,902
She was dirty.

220
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,809
She was a very dirty girl. Very dirty.

221
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,310
Do you remember...

222
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,250
...how many times you stabbed her?

223
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:22,815
Eighty-seven.

224
00:21:25,429 --> 00:21:26,589
Harvey....

225
00:21:29,533 --> 00:21:31,433
Get the fuck out of here.

226
00:21:31,535 --> 00:21:33,696
l got work to do.

227
00:21:34,705 --> 00:21:36,935
Come on, let's go. What?

228
00:21:37,107 --> 00:21:39,132
lnnocent blood is on these hands.

229
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:42,646
l understand. That's a terrible thing.
But let me tell you...

230
00:21:42,746 --> 00:21:47,115
...if you come back,
l'll make you stand in the corner again.

231
00:21:47,284 --> 00:21:51,721
-But innocent blood is on these hands.
-l understand. lt's terrible.

232
00:21:53,724 --> 00:21:56,056
You don't care about the truth.

233
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:00,729
We pay for city government, just like this,
and you never care about the truth.

234
00:22:00,865 --> 00:22:01,991
l killed her!

235
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:04,432
-l know.
-l killed her in the bathtub.

236
00:22:04,501 --> 00:22:06,059
Good-bye, Harvey.

237
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:11,533
Was it something l did in another life?

238
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:14,075
Probably something you did in this one.

239
00:22:15,913 --> 00:22:18,973
Stuff came in from Mercer.
Medical, dental receipts....

240
00:22:19,316 --> 00:22:21,546
Nothing in common with the others.

241
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,719
What's that around your neck?

242
00:22:25,322 --> 00:22:29,156
l'd get one like yours,
but l don't live near K Mart.

243
00:22:29,627 --> 00:22:31,754
How about friends, acquaintances?

244
00:22:32,663 --> 00:22:35,928
The only thing these girls had in common
is they all owned vibrators.

245
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,661
The tool of survival.

246
00:22:37,835 --> 00:22:40,497
How can he come to work wearing that?

247
00:22:40,671 --> 00:22:42,002
Lay off him.

248
00:22:42,406 --> 00:22:44,033
A cop should look like a cop.

249
00:22:44,108 --> 00:22:46,303
What's the world coming to?

250
00:22:47,278 --> 00:22:50,179
Let me let you talk to
the lead inspector on the case.

251
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:51,509
Hold on.

252
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,275
MJ, we got Deep Throat again.

253
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:57,109
How many calls is that?

254
00:22:57,187 --> 00:23:00,122
Makes three today. Fourteen, total.

255
00:23:00,524 --> 00:23:02,685
Phone company set up on our Centrex?

256
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,293
Yes, this morning.

257
00:23:04,428 --> 00:23:07,625
-Have Gigi put a tracer on her ass.
-See if it'll work.

258
00:23:08,933 --> 00:23:11,868
lnspector Monohan speaking. Homicide.

259
00:23:12,536 --> 00:23:14,800
Ask her about the moon bike.

260
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:18,039
l'm interested in your ideas.

261
00:23:18,142 --> 00:23:20,303
The moon bike....

262
00:23:22,446 --> 00:23:23,504
What is that?

263
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,638
Moon bike?

264
00:23:25,015 --> 00:23:28,143
l said a ''lunar cycle.''
l think he might be on a lunar cycle.

265
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:31,415
Because the first two murders
were 28 days apart.

266
00:23:31,588 --> 00:23:32,987
Still crackingjokes?

267
00:23:33,057 --> 00:23:37,357
No, this is no joke. Neither is tying up
police lines with crank calls.

268
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:39,225
Are you calling me a crank?

269
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:42,593
Do you have any evidence to report?
Did you know the victims?

270
00:23:42,666 --> 00:23:44,224
This is Number 3.

271
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,166
That is an opinion, not evidence.

272
00:23:46,236 --> 00:23:48,568
May l ask who l'm speaking with?

273
00:23:58,182 --> 00:23:59,649
Who's Helen Hudson?

274
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:04,310
What did you think of his claim,
that he tied these women to a tree...

275
00:24:04,421 --> 00:24:07,618
...and burned them alive
because Joan of Arc told him to?

276
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:08,988
He was lying.

277
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,583
How do you know?

278
00:24:10,694 --> 00:24:14,994
People suffering from aural hallucinations
hear voices in both ears.

279
00:24:15,199 --> 00:24:16,325
In stereo.

280
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,261
Daryll Lee told me...

281
00:24:18,936 --> 00:24:20,870
...Joan of Arc always appeared
on his left side...

282
00:24:20,938 --> 00:24:23,429
...and spoke softly in his left ear.

283
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:26,940
Those are the lab results,
hot off the press. No sperm.

284
00:24:28,212 --> 00:24:29,770
We've got a serial.

285
00:24:30,114 --> 00:24:31,706
You didn't say that.

286
00:24:32,349 --> 00:24:33,941
You interviewed Cullum three times.

287
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:37,143
Who's that?
The woman that got the cop killed?

288
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:38,654
She might be useful.

289
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:42,214
That woman is a wrong number.
Work the clues, for Christ's sake.

290
00:24:44,395 --> 00:24:46,158
What clues? We don't have any clues.

291
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,892
Nobody here ever worked
a serial case before.

292
00:24:50,034 --> 00:24:51,023
l have.

293
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:52,534
The Zodiac, right?

294
00:24:52,669 --> 00:24:56,469
Did anyone ever catch the Zodiac?
Or did he die of old age?

295
00:24:57,908 --> 00:25:00,638
Commissioner's on 2,
about the Chinatown thing.

296
00:25:00,978 --> 00:25:02,741
Work the clues.

297
00:25:06,517 --> 00:25:07,984
But what else?

298
00:25:09,053 --> 00:25:11,578
Mr. Cullum satisfies the rules for sanity...

299
00:25:11,655 --> 00:25:13,885
...in being fully aware
at the time of the murders...

300
00:25:13,957 --> 00:25:16,448
...that his actions were wrong
and unlawful.

301
00:25:16,527 --> 00:25:19,052
Thank you, Dr. Hudson.
No more questions.

302
00:25:30,741 --> 00:25:31,901
San Francisco Homicide.

303
00:25:31,975 --> 00:25:34,773
l'm lnspector Goetz,
this is lnspector Monohan.

304
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,769
ls Helen Hudson here?

305
00:25:36,847 --> 00:25:38,940
l'm her assistant. Can l help?

306
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:41,507
Could we have a few minutes?

307
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:43,577
Come in.

308
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:50,086
This way, please.

309
00:25:52,396 --> 00:25:55,957
Dr. Hudson,
this is lnspectors Goetz and Monohan.

310
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,630
He's escaped again, right?

311
00:25:58,702 --> 00:25:59,760
l'm sorry?

312
00:25:59,837 --> 00:26:00,633
Well?

313
00:26:00,704 --> 00:26:02,695
ls he out or isn't he?

314
00:26:02,873 --> 00:26:04,864
l'm not following, ma'am.

315
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:07,308
Let's talk about your phone calls.

316
00:26:07,478 --> 00:26:08,968
Phone calls?

317
00:26:09,246 --> 00:26:11,476
l didn't make any phone calls.

318
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,813
lsn't this nice?

319
00:26:14,985 --> 00:26:18,216
Would everyone like to sit down?
Shall l make coffee?

320
00:26:18,789 --> 00:26:20,051
Get me my stuff.

321
00:26:20,124 --> 00:26:21,386
Joyfully.

322
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,954
l talked to you this morning, Dr. Hudson.

323
00:26:26,697 --> 00:26:27,857
Do you remember?

324
00:26:27,931 --> 00:26:29,831
Of course l remember.

325
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,401
There's nothing wrong with my memory.
You called me a crank.

326
00:26:34,738 --> 00:26:36,467
l suppose l am.

327
00:26:36,707 --> 00:26:39,107
l got a couple crank calls myself.

328
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:42,406
That's why l thought
Daryll Lee Cullum was out of prison.

329
00:26:43,013 --> 00:26:46,642
lf Daryll Lee had gotten out,
you'd be the first to know.

330
00:26:47,518 --> 00:26:48,507
Good.

331
00:26:48,652 --> 00:26:49,846
l'm relieved.

332
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:53,356
l hate to sound like a broken record,
but you called us.

333
00:26:55,592 --> 00:26:58,026
l did. l'm sorry, it won't happen again.

334
00:26:58,095 --> 00:26:59,153
Why?

335
00:26:59,229 --> 00:27:03,598
There's a serial killer out there who
strangled three women. He'll do it again.

336
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:07,864
lf there's evidence connecting these
murders, nothing's been made public.

337
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:09,596
What connection?

338
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:10,901
l don't know.

339
00:27:10,974 --> 00:27:14,535
Twenty years of clinical experience
with serial killers.

340
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,872
Will you work with us?

341
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:21,849
You're kidding?

342
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:28,783
l thought you knew
that l don't do this anymore.

343
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:30,187
l'm retired.

344
00:27:30,394 --> 00:27:33,795
ls that why you called 14 times?
'Cause you're retired?

345
00:27:33,964 --> 00:27:36,489
Help me out. l really admire your work.

346
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:38,194
Does she do this...

347
00:27:38,802 --> 00:27:41,066
...wide-eyed, little-girl routine often?

348
00:27:41,138 --> 00:27:42,127
Yeah.

349
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:44,501
Does it work?

350
00:27:44,808 --> 00:27:46,708
-Usually.
-Sometimes.

351
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:49,472
You can spare me the bullshit.

352
00:27:49,646 --> 00:27:53,207
You don't admire me or like me.
None of your people do.

353
00:27:53,317 --> 00:27:57,413
But l don't give a fuck!
That's the upside of a nervous breakdown.

354
00:27:58,522 --> 00:28:01,082
lf you don't mind, l have a very busy day.

355
00:28:02,326 --> 00:28:05,318
lt's a hell of an apartment you got here.

356
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:06,828
l guess...

357
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:09,956
...the books you wrote
about these scumbags paid well.

358
00:28:10,033 --> 00:28:12,729
We can't afford to pay you...

359
00:28:12,936 --> 00:28:14,426
...your usual fee...

360
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:17,667
...but if you'd be so kind as to look....

361
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:20,442
l don't want these here.

362
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,536
-Would you be comfortable downtown?
-l don't want to see them here.

363
00:28:23,614 --> 00:28:25,605
l'll drive you, if you prefer.

364
00:28:34,458 --> 00:28:37,916
lt's all right. lt's okay.
Just breathe. l'm here.

365
00:28:39,696 --> 00:28:41,664
-Should we call the paramedics?
-No.

366
00:28:41,732 --> 00:28:44,064
lt's just a good old-fashioned panic attack.

367
00:28:44,134 --> 00:28:48,195
She hyperventilates till she passes out,
the breathing gets normal and she's fine.

368
00:28:48,272 --> 00:28:50,297
-What did we do?
-She's agoraphobic.

369
00:28:50,374 --> 00:28:52,638
She's afraid of spiders, too?

370
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:55,008
She hasn't left home in over a year.

371
00:28:55,078 --> 00:28:56,375
She's okay?

372
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,278
She's fine. Half an hour, she'll be singing.

373
00:28:59,483 --> 00:29:00,711
Tell her...

374
00:29:01,285 --> 00:29:03,378
...we're sorry we bothered her.

375
00:29:04,154 --> 00:29:06,213
Did you want her to look at those?

376
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:07,882
lf you do, leave them.

377
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:10,321
l'll make sure they're safe.

378
00:29:10,394 --> 00:29:12,157
Tell her to call me...

379
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:13,991
...if she feels like it.

380
00:29:21,905 --> 00:29:24,305
That one is a strange ranger.

381
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:27,509
Quinn said she was a crackpot.

382
00:29:27,577 --> 00:29:31,513
He forgot to mention
pill-popping, juice-head...

383
00:29:31,748 --> 00:29:34,581
...hyperventilating, agoraphobic asshole.

384
00:29:36,086 --> 00:29:37,917
l thought she was sweet.

385
00:29:40,424 --> 00:29:42,016
Honest to God!

386
00:30:04,281 --> 00:30:05,612
Are they gone?

387
00:30:06,383 --> 00:30:07,407
All gone.

388
00:30:09,453 --> 00:30:12,115
l must've looked like such an asshole.

389
00:30:14,491 --> 00:30:16,288
You look good with a bag on your head.

390
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,793
Oh, God.

391
00:30:17,961 --> 00:30:19,223
l want to die.

392
00:30:19,296 --> 00:30:20,490
l wouldn't.

393
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:22,064
He'll be back.

394
00:30:22,165 --> 00:30:23,564
Who'll be back?

395
00:30:24,067 --> 00:30:26,126
Don't be coy.

396
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,328
You thought he was cute, too.

397
00:30:28,405 --> 00:30:30,635
No, l didn't. l did not.

398
00:30:31,074 --> 00:30:35,977
You like those cute, brutal types
with the eyebrows and the handcuffs.

399
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:38,875
Admit it.

400
00:30:40,484 --> 00:30:41,314
Oh, God.

401
00:30:41,385 --> 00:30:43,580
What? What'd l say?

402
00:30:43,887 --> 00:30:45,081
Nothing.

403
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:47,380
l miss men.

404
00:30:48,091 --> 00:30:49,490
What am l?

405
00:30:49,593 --> 00:30:51,083
You know what l mean.

406
00:30:52,162 --> 00:30:53,891
l miss sex.

407
00:30:58,001 --> 00:30:59,468
He was pretty cute.

408
00:30:59,536 --> 00:31:02,004
Yes, he was very cute.

409
00:31:05,008 --> 00:31:07,169
No young cops for you.

410
00:31:09,012 --> 00:31:12,277
Up you come. Sit over here.
Look at these pictures.

411
00:31:12,382 --> 00:31:13,781
Why are these here?

412
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,613
l'll get you coffee.

413
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,609
l can't.

414
00:31:17,687 --> 00:31:19,848
Why don't you just die, then?

415
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,684
They'll find you years from now amongst
unopened mail and unread newspapers.

416
00:31:25,862 --> 00:31:29,923
Yeah, the old hermit lady.
She lived on cat food and Camembert.

417
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:32,693
She used to be a really good shrink.

418
00:31:32,869 --> 00:31:35,633
Make up your mind. Here's your coffee.

419
00:31:35,872 --> 00:31:37,430
Live or die.

420
00:36:24,594 --> 00:36:26,084
You scared me.

421
00:36:26,196 --> 00:36:27,925
Burning the midnight oil?

422
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,593
This stuff never gets any easier.

423
00:36:32,736 --> 00:36:35,500
That's why they pay us the small bucks.

424
00:36:42,078 --> 00:36:43,409
Do you--?

425
00:36:48,752 --> 00:36:50,583
What would you think if...

426
00:36:50,754 --> 00:36:53,621
...when you're finished here
we go to Joe's and we...

427
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:56,123
...have a steak and....

428
00:36:58,962 --> 00:37:00,520
l don't think so.

429
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:03,355
Thanks anyway.

430
00:37:04,534 --> 00:37:08,630
You got other plans?
Not that it's any of my business....

431
00:37:09,405 --> 00:37:10,963
You got that right.

432
00:37:12,408 --> 00:37:14,308
Bean curd, smoked eel, sushi.

433
00:37:15,211 --> 00:37:18,408
We got prawn tempura, seaweed salad.
You want to join us?

434
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:20,949
You kiss your mother after eating that?

435
00:37:21,217 --> 00:37:23,208
No. l can kiss you, if you like.

436
00:37:23,286 --> 00:37:24,651
Go fuck yourself.

437
00:37:32,662 --> 00:37:33,993
Who put the bug up his ass?

438
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:35,724
Where's my cheeseburger?

439
00:37:36,032 --> 00:37:37,966
l made an executive decision.

440
00:37:38,568 --> 00:37:40,001
Japanese.

441
00:37:41,104 --> 00:37:42,935
lt's better for your heart.

442
00:37:45,909 --> 00:37:48,673
You didn't even get French fries.
You're pissing me off.

443
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:50,076
Here, here.

444
00:37:50,914 --> 00:37:52,404
Any word from...

445
00:37:52,782 --> 00:37:55,046
...Helen ''Paper Bag'' Hudson?

446
00:37:55,518 --> 00:37:57,577
Not yet, but there will be.

447
00:37:57,754 --> 00:37:58,413
No way.

448
00:37:58,488 --> 00:38:00,820
Five bucks she's going to call tonight.

449
00:38:02,158 --> 00:38:03,182
Deal.

450
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,593
Wait a minute.

451
00:38:08,598 --> 00:38:11,431
What's this Quarter Pounder
with cheese doing here?

452
00:38:26,049 --> 00:38:28,108
lnspector Monohan, please.

453
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:30,851
These three are
the work of the same man.

454
00:38:31,788 --> 00:38:33,380
This one is different.

455
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,348
Are you testing me?

456
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:39,027
Not exactly. We had reason to believe....

457
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:41,229
l have to take tests now?

458
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,494
Ongoing case?

459
00:38:45,568 --> 00:38:46,796
Six months.

460
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:50,066
The scene is disorganized.

461
00:38:50,139 --> 00:38:53,540
The killer lives nearby.
He'd be too disoriented to drive.

462
00:38:53,643 --> 00:38:58,307
You have two possibilities: One is
a mental patient, the other is a boyfriend.

463
00:38:58,481 --> 00:39:01,177
Someone who was denied sex
on this occasion...

464
00:39:01,251 --> 00:39:02,878
...who knew and cared about her.

465
00:39:02,952 --> 00:39:04,351
He beat the shit out of her.

466
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,081
But he felt remorse.

467
00:39:06,589 --> 00:39:10,081
He covered her up afterward,
because he felt conflicted.

468
00:39:11,261 --> 00:39:12,888
Not like this man.

469
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:17,155
These are the work of someone
who is not conflicted at all.

470
00:39:17,233 --> 00:39:19,667
He's doing exactly what he wants to do.

471
00:39:19,802 --> 00:39:21,133
Highly organized.

472
00:39:21,204 --> 00:39:24,401
l'll bet there were no prints,
no stains, no blood.

473
00:39:24,841 --> 00:39:25,535
Right.

474
00:39:25,608 --> 00:39:28,771
No sign of forced entry.
He probably conned his way in.

475
00:39:29,279 --> 00:39:31,440
They may or may not be about sex.

476
00:39:31,681 --> 00:39:33,342
But they're about power.

477
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:36,112
See the multiple thumbprints
along the throat?

478
00:39:36,786 --> 00:39:38,447
Was the hyoid bone broken?

479
00:39:38,521 --> 00:39:40,011
Yes, it was.

480
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:43,752
He strangles them face to face,
so they can see his power...

481
00:39:43,893 --> 00:39:46,487
...and he can watch their terror.
That gets him on.

482
00:39:46,562 --> 00:39:48,723
Then he revives them and does it again.

483
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:53,701
Look for an intelligent white male,
20 to 30 years old, socially functional...

484
00:39:54,137 --> 00:39:57,197
...with a major interest in golden oldies.

485
00:40:00,944 --> 00:40:02,434
Did l pass?

486
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:05,375
You passed.
What do you mean by golden oldies?

487
00:40:06,215 --> 00:40:09,446
Where's the stocking
that was tied around this one's neck?

488
00:40:10,053 --> 00:40:11,384
How'd you know that?

489
00:40:11,454 --> 00:40:14,321
l mean, l assume it was a stocking
and not pantyhose...

490
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,381
...tied in a big loopy bow...

491
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:17,892
...like this one.

492
00:40:19,462 --> 00:40:20,156
Right.

493
00:40:20,229 --> 00:40:23,323
For goodness sakes,
it's the Boston Strangler.

494
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:27,900
He's imitating Albert DeSalvo's
crime scene down to the kinky details.

495
00:40:28,071 --> 00:40:31,131
This guy's copycatting a serial killer
who's been dead for....

496
00:40:31,207 --> 00:40:32,572
Twenty years.

497
00:40:32,642 --> 00:40:35,304
Why DeSalvo?
Why not somebody in the news recently?

498
00:40:35,378 --> 00:40:37,209
Gacy or Ramirez.

499
00:40:37,714 --> 00:40:38,976
l don't know.

500
00:40:39,182 --> 00:40:41,742
These guys are like viruses.

501
00:40:41,918 --> 00:40:44,580
There's always some new mutation.

502
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:25,954
The commissioner is up my ass,
saying we could use help here.

503
00:41:26,095 --> 00:41:29,258
We could use help.
We need their VlCAP, we need their...

504
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:31,724
...database thingies.

505
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:34,428
The FBl will bury you with fucking help.

506
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:35,936
During Patty Hearst...

507
00:41:36,005 --> 00:41:40,032
...some kid with a crew cut
took over my office for a month.

508
00:41:40,109 --> 00:41:42,737
So, you're saying...?

509
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:44,710
l'm saying, if you need help...

510
00:41:44,781 --> 00:41:47,875
...Nico is almost through
with the Chinatown thing.

511
00:41:47,950 --> 00:41:50,475
That really won't be necessary, sir.

512
00:41:51,154 --> 00:41:52,815
Join us. We need you.

513
00:41:52,989 --> 00:41:55,082
Anyone with a similar profile
to the Strangler.

514
00:41:55,158 --> 00:41:57,251
Or with a German wife.
Chick, can you do that?

515
00:41:57,326 --> 00:41:59,760
Anyone who wears green pants....

516
00:42:00,329 --> 00:42:01,796
The files in from Boston, yet?

517
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:04,264
Should be here in the morning.

518
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,024
What are you up to?

519
00:42:06,102 --> 00:42:07,296
Going to Chinatown.

520
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:09,668
Sit down for a minute.

521
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:14,600
What do you got?

522
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,752
Winning?

523
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:33,953
l'm pulverizing him.

524
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,463
All right, l'm off.

525
00:42:35,932 --> 00:42:37,866
-See you.
-Have a good time.

526
00:42:38,434 --> 00:42:40,197
l won't wait up.

527
00:42:43,773 --> 00:42:45,365
Got you.

528
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:10,852
She's next.

529
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,052
How do you know?

530
00:44:12,128 --> 00:44:14,289
'Cause l watched her face change to that.

531
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:16,228
Did you try to play it back?

532
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,190
How did he send this to you?

533
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:20,167
He hacked into her lnternet address.

534
00:44:20,236 --> 00:44:22,101
Can we trace it?

535
00:44:22,238 --> 00:44:24,331
-Only if he's online right now.
-He ain't.

536
00:44:24,407 --> 00:44:25,931
Can we rewind or...?

537
00:44:27,143 --> 00:44:29,634
Yeah, we should be able to play it back.

538
00:44:30,213 --> 00:44:32,340
-How long is the program?
-Thirty seconds.

539
00:44:32,415 --> 00:44:35,748
-Can we get a copy of that face?
-No, it's too big a file.

540
00:44:36,219 --> 00:44:38,312
Back up to tape.

541
00:44:38,821 --> 00:44:43,087
She's got a tape backup.
We can make a copy and take it with us.

542
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:45,217
How do you know all this?

543
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:48,090
Misspent youth in video arcades, l guess.

544
00:44:49,031 --> 00:44:50,589
A lot of quarters.

545
00:44:53,035 --> 00:44:54,559
Why would he send this to you?

546
00:44:54,637 --> 00:44:55,763
Why do you think?

547
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:57,237
No one mentioned your involvement.

548
00:44:57,306 --> 00:45:00,332
There is no involvement. l'm not involved!

549
00:45:00,476 --> 00:45:03,274
This is a game they play.
They hang around watching the cops...

550
00:45:03,346 --> 00:45:04,779
...feeling superior to them.

551
00:45:04,847 --> 00:45:07,213
And instead of catching him,
you led him to me.

552
00:45:07,283 --> 00:45:09,683
He didn't write to me,
he wrote to you. Why?

553
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:11,743
Because l'm their damn pin-up girl.

554
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:15,257
They all know me. They have libraries.
They collect clippings.

555
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:17,756
l'm the muse of serial killers.

556
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:37,110
Try the C drive.

557
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,807
Any other suggestions?

558
00:45:40,149 --> 00:45:42,379
lt's gone. The file is not here.

559
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:46,319
lt's not on C drive, and it's not in List.

560
00:45:46,689 --> 00:45:48,816
You think he put a virus in there?

561
00:45:49,225 --> 00:45:50,954
-Yeah.
-What exactly is...?

562
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,288
He wrote a virus into the program.
lf you try to copy it, it's erased.

563
00:45:54,363 --> 00:45:55,489
He booby-trapped it!

564
00:45:55,564 --> 00:45:57,327
l must hand it to the guy.

565
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:01,061
-He's a smart motherfucker.
-Do you remember what she looked like?

566
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:03,398
Yes.

567
00:46:03,539 --> 00:46:05,404
She looked like a girl.

568
00:46:05,474 --> 00:46:07,806
She looked like a million other girls.

569
00:46:10,179 --> 00:46:11,806
l barely saw her.

570
00:46:17,286 --> 00:46:20,585
l'm going to the office
to get a systems guy on this. Marty.

571
00:46:22,124 --> 00:46:23,284
What're you doing?

572
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,656
Unplugging this.

573
00:46:24,727 --> 00:46:27,389
lt's an open window.
He can crawl in any time he likes.

574
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:31,524
He comes in, we grab him.
lt's the only lead we've got.

575
00:46:31,867 --> 00:46:33,164
And what am l?

576
00:46:33,302 --> 00:46:35,270
The lamb tied to the stake?

577
00:46:35,404 --> 00:46:39,033
This is the only space
that l have in the world.

578
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:41,801
-You're not getting it.
-l'll get a guard here.

579
00:46:41,877 --> 00:46:43,606
l don't want a guard here!

580
00:46:43,679 --> 00:46:44,873
All right.

581
00:46:45,147 --> 00:46:47,411
-We're all working together.
-l'm not.

582
00:46:47,483 --> 00:46:49,713
l'm not working with anybody.

583
00:46:50,219 --> 00:46:54,952
Turn the monitor back on and l'll stay
until we figure out what's happening.

584
00:46:55,558 --> 00:46:57,321
-Go on.
-Catch you later.

585
00:46:58,361 --> 00:46:59,521
All right?

586
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:01,924
Heil, Hitler.

587
00:47:12,174 --> 00:47:15,940
l don't think he's going to send us
anything tonight. He's too busy.

588
00:47:20,783 --> 00:47:22,114
You want a drink?

589
00:47:22,718 --> 00:47:24,049
No, thank you.

590
00:47:24,286 --> 00:47:25,913
On duty?

591
00:47:26,389 --> 00:47:27,651
Always.

592
00:47:29,191 --> 00:47:30,351
So....

593
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,825
What about you and the wee inspector?

594
00:47:37,199 --> 00:47:39,099
What about us?

595
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:44,839
Are you?

596
00:47:45,941 --> 00:47:47,272
We're partners.

597
00:47:47,576 --> 00:47:48,702
Partners?

598
00:47:48,811 --> 00:47:50,506
ln every way?

599
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,106
Not yet.

600
00:47:54,917 --> 00:47:56,612
Self-confident.

601
00:47:57,620 --> 00:47:58,814
Actually, l'm...

602
00:47:58,888 --> 00:47:59,980
...shy...

603
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:01,347
...selective.

604
00:48:01,424 --> 00:48:02,982
The trouble is l'm...

605
00:48:05,561 --> 00:48:07,256
...l'm finding myself....

606
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,699
You're in the witness category, you see.

607
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:26,341
ln better times, maybe.

608
00:48:34,457 --> 00:48:35,788
Peter!

609
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:43,189
l've been calling and calling.
Didn't you hear me?

610
00:48:44,366 --> 00:48:46,266
Completely forgot about me.

611
00:48:47,102 --> 00:48:49,832
Very thirsty, weren't you,
my little sweetie?

612
00:48:50,506 --> 00:48:51,837
Come on.

613
00:48:52,141 --> 00:48:53,733
Are you teasing me?

614
00:48:53,809 --> 00:48:55,401
Naughty little boy.

615
00:48:56,479 --> 00:48:59,505
What are you doing?
Want to watch Letterman with me?

616
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:01,449
Well, l could, but....

617
00:49:01,517 --> 00:49:03,712
l don't watch talk shows on my own.

618
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:05,081
l know.

619
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:09,087
Oh, go on.

620
00:49:09,158 --> 00:49:11,683
Go back to your silly little computers.

621
00:49:12,795 --> 00:49:13,955
Thanks.

622
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:17,056
Haven't you forgotten something?

623
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:32,540
l love you.

624
00:49:32,648 --> 00:49:34,047
Yeah, me, too.

625
00:50:52,227 --> 00:50:54,695
Look's like you're in a bit of trouble.

626
00:50:56,699 --> 00:50:58,496
l'm going to place my hand...

627
00:50:58,567 --> 00:50:59,932
...right here.

628
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:04,337
l'm going to put my elbow right here.

629
00:51:05,741 --> 00:51:07,072
Just...

630
00:51:09,178 --> 00:51:10,167
...cut...

631
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,469
...there.

632
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:15,542
There, now.

633
00:51:15,684 --> 00:51:18,312
Didn't l say l'd take care of you?

634
00:51:19,388 --> 00:51:21,083
Goodness! You're so hot!

635
00:51:25,961 --> 00:51:28,896
This is going to hurt a little, l'm afraid.

636
00:51:30,666 --> 00:51:32,293
They claim they didn't see anything.

637
00:51:32,368 --> 00:51:35,496
You received a call from dispatch
at 6:35 a.m.?

638
00:51:35,704 --> 00:51:39,868
Correct. 6:35. The first unit arrived
about 15 minutes later.

639
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:41,135
Great.

640
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,235
Did you isolate the kids who found her?

641
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:45,906
Yes, they're over on the side of the hill.

642
00:51:45,981 --> 00:51:47,915
How many of you knew her?

643
00:51:48,083 --> 00:51:49,846
We just danced.

644
00:51:49,918 --> 00:51:51,078
Really?

645
00:51:51,286 --> 00:51:53,254
You just met her tonight?

646
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:56,179
Excuse me.

647
00:51:56,258 --> 00:51:57,520
Good afternoon.

648
00:51:59,061 --> 00:52:01,655
Did you stand too far
from your razor today?

649
00:52:02,698 --> 00:52:04,632
l was up all night with a sick friend.

650
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,691
l want to talk to you.

651
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:09,802
Have you got a thing going with MJ now?

652
00:52:10,706 --> 00:52:12,435
l don't believe it.

653
00:52:12,641 --> 00:52:14,973
Good God, man, you stink.

654
00:52:15,377 --> 00:52:18,346
Heavy date last night?
Are you screwing around on her already?

655
00:52:18,414 --> 00:52:19,745
What's wrong with you?

656
00:52:19,815 --> 00:52:23,444
Me? l'll tell you, you just treat her right.

657
00:52:24,086 --> 00:52:27,647
Don't go screwing around on her.
She doesn't deserve that.

658
00:52:28,657 --> 00:52:30,955
Remind me again why she dumped you.

659
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:38,528
Why is he here?

660
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,125
What do you see? Tell me what you see.

661
00:52:42,838 --> 00:52:46,239
There are stains.
So, she's been sexually assaulted.

662
00:52:46,909 --> 00:52:50,606
No defense wounds. No ligature marks
or bruising, like the others.

663
00:52:50,779 --> 00:52:52,076
Very cyanotic.

664
00:52:52,181 --> 00:52:53,705
Asphyxiation, huh?

665
00:52:53,816 --> 00:52:56,580
-Doesn't look like our guy.
-You don't think so?

666
00:52:56,719 --> 00:52:58,584
Look at her heels.

667
00:52:59,021 --> 00:53:01,455
There's abrasions, but no bleeding.

668
00:53:01,557 --> 00:53:03,525
-She's been dragged up here postmortem.
-Maybe.

669
00:53:03,592 --> 00:53:06,857
On this stuff we're not going to get
any prints or tracks.

670
00:53:07,129 --> 00:53:08,426
Long night?

671
00:53:08,497 --> 00:53:10,761
-Don't you start.
-What about her arms?

672
00:53:14,169 --> 00:53:15,659
There's needle marks.

673
00:53:15,838 --> 00:53:18,204
No tracks. Not a regular user.

674
00:53:18,307 --> 00:53:20,707
So stoned, she never knew what got her.

675
00:53:20,776 --> 00:53:21,970
Hope so.

676
00:53:22,377 --> 00:53:24,277
Lot of little hippie girls.

677
00:53:24,646 --> 00:53:28,343
They all want to make love.
They all want to be beautiful.

678
00:53:28,517 --> 00:53:30,178
That's your type, right?

679
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:32,953
What're you doing?

680
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:35,148
Want to be on the six o'clock news?

681
00:53:35,224 --> 00:53:38,193
Go down and finish taking statements.

682
00:53:46,769 --> 00:53:48,327
Let's get out of here.

683
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,478
l know. They found another one.

684
00:54:00,949 --> 00:54:02,974
What? Ruben told you already?

685
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:05,053
l heard it on my scanner.

686
00:54:05,854 --> 00:54:07,788
-Can l use your phone?
-Sure.

687
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:11,292
They want you to call the office?
Your phone is busted.

688
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:13,089
You're some piece of work.

689
00:54:13,162 --> 00:54:16,359
l turned that damn scanner off,
and then l turned it on again.

690
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:20,561
l can't listen to it, but l can't
not listen to it. So l make Andy.

691
00:54:20,736 --> 00:54:24,900
Are you on medication,
because l need your whole brain on duty.

692
00:54:25,407 --> 00:54:26,931
l'm not on duty.

693
00:54:27,042 --> 00:54:28,737
Neither is my brain.

694
00:54:29,178 --> 00:54:31,669
Everything is different. Different guy.

695
00:54:32,614 --> 00:54:34,878
She was asphyxiated, not strangled.

696
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:37,850
Dumped outdoors, sexually assaulted.

697
00:54:38,754 --> 00:54:40,449
So, nothing like DeSalvo.

698
00:54:40,622 --> 00:54:42,590
Completely different.

699
00:54:43,358 --> 00:54:45,986
Monohan, messages, please.

700
00:54:46,328 --> 00:54:47,693
Why do you need me?

701
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:49,697
l think l'm wrong...

702
00:54:50,098 --> 00:54:53,295
...because something was
artificial about it.

703
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:55,800
Like posed. She was on display.

704
00:54:56,038 --> 00:54:59,474
Why drag a body
all the way up a huge hill...

705
00:54:59,842 --> 00:55:02,242
...where it will be found by tourists?

706
00:55:02,411 --> 00:55:04,936
You think he's changed his routine?

707
00:55:05,347 --> 00:55:07,110
That doesn't happen.

708
00:55:09,017 --> 00:55:10,609
These men are robotic.

709
00:55:10,853 --> 00:55:14,516
The murder's a ritual.
The method is part of the pleasure.

710
00:55:14,890 --> 00:55:16,881
Why is that computer off?

711
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:19,058
Because l turned it off.

712
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:20,617
You can't do that.

713
00:55:21,163 --> 00:55:23,222
l believe l can.

714
00:55:23,432 --> 00:55:25,900
But would you like me to turn it back on?

715
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,737
Hello, Ruben.

716
00:55:32,908 --> 00:55:36,309
Please thank lnspector Goetz
for taking care of me last night.

717
00:55:37,546 --> 00:55:41,312
Dr. Hudson wants me to thank you
for taking care of her last night.

718
00:55:47,956 --> 00:55:50,447
Lab results on the new one.

719
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,985
Two kinds of sperm.

720
00:55:55,797 --> 00:55:57,094
l guess that's...

721
00:55:57,165 --> 00:55:58,655
...a gang thing.

722
00:56:00,335 --> 00:56:02,496
Thanks for the use of your phone.

723
00:56:11,246 --> 00:56:13,146
There were two kinds of sperm?

724
00:56:16,318 --> 00:56:19,082
They said one was a secretor,
the other was not.

725
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:22,518
How'd you know about that?

726
00:56:22,658 --> 00:56:24,592
There were needle marks.

727
00:56:28,196 --> 00:56:29,686
On her right arm?

728
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,665
So far, nothing they test for
comes out positive.

729
00:56:33,735 --> 00:56:36,533
Was the body found
near a ''No Dumping'' sign?

730
00:56:37,906 --> 00:56:39,498
Like this?

731
00:56:42,344 --> 00:56:44,005
l could've taken that picture.

732
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,309
Shit. He switched.

733
00:56:46,381 --> 00:56:49,145
From DeSalvo to Bianchi and Buono.
The Hillside Strangler.

734
00:56:49,217 --> 00:56:52,186
Two men. Two kinds of sperm.
Very witty, our guy.

735
00:56:52,521 --> 00:56:54,955
You said that they're like robots--

736
00:56:55,023 --> 00:56:58,220
Yeah, but consistency
is the hobgoblin of small minds.

737
00:56:58,293 --> 00:57:02,252
Tell them to test for chemicals found
in window cleaner: ammonia, ethanol.

738
00:57:03,332 --> 00:57:05,527
lt's what they injected into victims.

739
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,296
Why these guys? And why in such detail?

740
00:57:09,404 --> 00:57:10,962
He wants to dazzle us.

741
00:57:11,206 --> 00:57:14,039
Anyone can strangle someone in a tub.

742
00:57:14,543 --> 00:57:16,443
He's saying, ''Look out.

743
00:57:16,745 --> 00:57:18,713
''l'm just getting started.''

744
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:20,005
In San Francisco...

745
00:57:20,082 --> 00:57:23,142
...the mutilated body of an unidentified
young woman was discovered.

746
00:57:23,218 --> 00:57:25,152
Police have yet to comment
on the slaying...

747
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:29,156
...which is the fourth such body
found in the last six weeks.

748
00:57:29,391 --> 00:57:32,019
Reporting live is Susan Schiffer.

749
00:57:32,127 --> 00:57:36,427
In response to growing alarm,
a special task force is being set up...

750
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:38,398
...inside the Police Department.

751
00:57:38,467 --> 00:57:42,665
Aiding the police is noted
criminal psychologist, Dr. Helen Hudson.

752
00:57:43,038 --> 00:57:46,838
It was her expert testimony that
sent Daryll Lee Cullum to Death Row...

753
00:57:46,908 --> 00:57:48,637
...for the murders of two young women.

754
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:52,840
Cullum later escaped and attacked
Dr. Hudson, killing a police officer.

755
00:57:53,015 --> 00:57:57,281
Meanwhile, schoolyards are empty,
college campuses are deserted...

756
00:57:57,386 --> 00:58:01,220
...and a terrified city locks its doors.

757
00:58:29,451 --> 00:58:30,975
Oh, hi. Sorry.

758
00:58:31,086 --> 00:58:33,714
l'm a little lost. Can you help me out?

759
00:58:34,122 --> 00:58:35,350
Yeah, sure.

760
00:58:39,494 --> 00:58:40,654
Thanks.

761
00:58:40,996 --> 00:58:44,727
We have a white female, early 20s,
found in vehicle.

762
00:58:44,833 --> 00:58:47,927
Gunshot trauma to head.
Request CSU forensics and coroner.

763
00:58:48,003 --> 00:58:49,493
Backup is requested.

764
00:58:50,372 --> 00:58:51,737
Got you.

765
00:58:52,107 --> 00:58:53,404
lt's a beauty.

766
00:58:53,542 --> 00:58:54,634
Great.

767
00:58:54,810 --> 00:58:56,437
l'll look at it soon.

768
00:59:06,154 --> 00:59:08,816
You thought you heard a backfire?
Where were you?

769
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:11,859
l was just waiting to cross the street,
going east.

770
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,759
Excuse me.

771
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:17,993
Hi, it's me, Helen.

772
00:59:18,066 --> 00:59:19,897
Look, this isn't a good time.

773
00:59:19,968 --> 00:59:22,368
It's a woman shot in a car?

774
00:59:22,737 --> 00:59:24,932
No, it looks like a drive-by.

775
00:59:25,107 --> 00:59:28,474
She's in a parked car, shot in the head,
no sexual assault.

776
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,975
Which side is she on?

777
00:59:30,045 --> 00:59:33,173
-Look, l really got to--
-Yeah, the passenger side.

778
00:59:34,649 --> 00:59:36,276
Was the tape player on?

779
00:59:36,351 --> 00:59:38,819
l don't know. Was the tape player on
when you got here?

780
00:59:38,887 --> 00:59:43,051
Yeah, it was. lt was driving me crazy,
so l shut it off.

781
00:59:43,658 --> 00:59:46,252
Okay. Switch it on, would you?

782
00:59:48,263 --> 00:59:48,957
lt's still warm.

783
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:52,329
Don't laugh, but I think
it might be the Partridge Family.

784
00:59:53,835 --> 00:59:55,496
Put the tape player on.

785
00:59:55,637 --> 00:59:58,231
Helen thinks it might be
the Partridge Family.

786
01:00:05,614 --> 01:00:07,138
Don't hang up.

787
01:00:07,582 --> 01:00:09,573
ls a gas station nearby?

788
01:00:10,952 --> 01:00:12,749
With a phone booth?

789
01:00:12,921 --> 01:00:14,479
Go look for a note.

790
01:00:15,924 --> 01:00:18,654
Here. l got to go check the pay phone.

791
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,111
lt's Berkowitz, isn't it?

792
01:00:49,024 --> 01:00:50,787
He's doing Son of Sam.

793
01:00:51,459 --> 01:00:55,395
She was sitting in a parked car
when she was shot.

794
01:00:55,530 --> 01:00:56,929
Look in the crowd.

795
01:00:56,998 --> 01:00:59,796
Berkowitz liked to watch cops work.

796
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:47,611
Helen, we found a note.

797
01:01:48,049 --> 01:01:51,416
lt says, ''Let me haunt you
with these words: l'll be back.''

798
01:01:51,486 --> 01:01:52,748
lt's for Helen.

799
01:01:52,821 --> 01:01:54,413
l'm going over there.

800
01:01:55,323 --> 01:01:59,919
l know it's kind of late, but Ruben's
going to drop by with a few questions.

801
01:02:00,028 --> 01:02:02,496
Look, l got to go, so l'll see you later.

802
01:02:10,305 --> 01:02:12,273
lnspector Monohan, Homicide.

803
01:02:15,143 --> 01:02:18,408
l need a 10-25 to Pier One, Fort Mason.

804
01:02:18,513 --> 01:02:20,947
Approach Code 2. Wait for instructions.

805
01:02:21,216 --> 01:02:23,946
Alert the officer on security duty there.

806
01:02:54,783 --> 01:02:57,251
Just steal the car and go.

807
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:01,281
Burt?

808
01:06:36,137 --> 01:06:38,503
l'll deal with you later, asshole.

809
01:06:40,408 --> 01:06:42,672
You must think l'm a complete moron!

810
01:06:43,077 --> 01:06:46,103
Until we know better,
l say the guy's just a junkie.

811
01:06:46,214 --> 01:06:47,340
A junkie?!

812
01:06:47,448 --> 01:06:51,407
ln a full-on SWAT suit?!
Ruben, you're such a lousy liar.

813
01:06:51,486 --> 01:06:53,078
Are you sure nothing's missing?

814
01:06:53,154 --> 01:06:56,487
Yes, there is! The cop
who was supposed to be at my door!

815
01:06:56,624 --> 01:06:57,613
Where was he?

816
01:06:57,692 --> 01:06:59,887
He screwed up. That's not the point.

817
01:06:59,961 --> 01:07:03,556
lt is! You dragged me into this,
you're supposed to protect me.

818
01:07:03,965 --> 01:07:05,091
What're you doing?

819
01:07:05,166 --> 01:07:06,724
l'm checking the bed!

820
01:07:07,769 --> 01:07:10,465
That man is in and out
when he feels like it!

821
01:07:10,705 --> 01:07:13,333
We got here as quickly as we could, okay?

822
01:07:13,474 --> 01:07:14,839
Fortunately--

823
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:19,073
Why is that?! Why did you come
to my rescue so fortuitously, huh?!

824
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,283
There was a note, wasn't there?
At the gas station.

825
01:07:30,158 --> 01:07:32,092
l was right. What'd it say?

826
01:07:34,095 --> 01:07:38,088
You think the guy's been in here before?
You said that.

827
01:07:38,700 --> 01:07:40,361
l don't know.

828
01:07:41,035 --> 01:07:43,435
Someone came
and messed with my clothes.

829
01:07:44,105 --> 01:07:46,733
And they put this red suit of mine
on the bed.

830
01:07:46,808 --> 01:07:48,400
Anything special about it?

831
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:50,774
lt was the one l was wearing...

832
01:07:50,945 --> 01:07:52,537
...at the lecture hall.

833
01:07:53,915 --> 01:07:55,041
Why didn't you report it?

834
01:07:55,116 --> 01:07:56,777
l didn't know.

835
01:07:56,951 --> 01:07:59,545
l thought it was me, you know?

836
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:03,615
l had taken a lot of pills
and l had been drinking.

837
01:08:04,192 --> 01:08:07,719
l just didn't know.
l wasn't sure then, but l am now!

838
01:08:07,795 --> 01:08:11,287
So stop pretending to me
that it's a burglar!

839
01:08:11,366 --> 01:08:15,564
Stop treating me like l'm some
fucking idiot! Tell me the truth!

840
01:08:20,408 --> 01:08:23,434
l think the man who has killed
five women in this city...

841
01:08:23,511 --> 01:08:25,308
...was just in your apartment.

842
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:27,143
l don't know why.

843
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:31,418
But l do know he has a plan,
and you seem to be a part of it.

844
01:08:35,590 --> 01:08:39,424
The truth is he's very smart,
and he's way ahead of us.

845
01:08:40,895 --> 01:08:43,989
And l take it your moving is
out of the question?

846
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:48,499
So, all l know to do...

847
01:08:48,736 --> 01:08:52,604
...is run the usual checks,
change your locks, tighten security...

848
01:08:52,674 --> 01:08:54,005
...and pray.

849
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:58,339
Feel better?

850
01:09:01,215 --> 01:09:02,512
No.

851
01:09:03,785 --> 01:09:06,117
But l appreciate your candor.

852
01:09:10,892 --> 01:09:12,985
When do l get to see this note?

853
01:09:33,481 --> 01:09:37,713
''There really isn't any need for bloodshed

854
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:41,947
''Just do it with a little more finesse

855
01:09:43,391 --> 01:09:47,350
''Ifyou can slip that tablet
into someone's coffee

856
01:09:48,296 --> 01:09:52,027
''And it avoids an awful lot of mess

857
01:09:52,867 --> 01:09:55,836
''Because it's murder by numbers

858
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:57,697
''One, two, three

859
01:09:58,139 --> 01:10:00,369
''It's as easy to learn

860
01:10:00,441 --> 01:10:02,602
''As your A-B-Cs

861
01:10:02,777 --> 01:10:05,769
''It's number by number....''

862
01:10:12,587 --> 01:10:14,350
Good morning, Commissioner.

863
01:10:14,956 --> 01:10:16,184
Good morning.

864
01:10:16,624 --> 01:10:18,751
''Murder By Numbers,'' by The Police.

865
01:10:19,093 --> 01:10:23,120
Obviously, the killer wants us to hear
this song for reasons other than...

866
01:10:23,197 --> 01:10:25,097
...music appreciation.

867
01:10:25,466 --> 01:10:27,297
Familiarize yourselves with the lyrics.

868
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:30,360
We need to figure out
what he's trying to tell us.

869
01:10:30,671 --> 01:10:33,731
l think that about covers it.
Anything else?

870
01:10:34,008 --> 01:10:35,373
Yes, lnspector?

871
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:38,570
We're set up on Helen's phone line
so we can monitor calls...

872
01:10:38,646 --> 01:10:40,944
...and anything coming to her modem.

873
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:43,277
Questions?

874
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:01,298
He is not a happy camper.

875
01:11:01,969 --> 01:11:04,062
-The Hudson broad.
-What about her?

876
01:11:04,605 --> 01:11:09,042
The commissioner thinks, and l agree,
that she's leaking like a rusty bucket.

877
01:11:10,578 --> 01:11:13,069
Maybe she's trying to hype her new book.
l don't know.

878
01:11:13,147 --> 01:11:16,378
She's just not reliable.
Especially after lunch.

879
01:11:16,651 --> 01:11:20,417
She has been really useful to us
on this case.

880
01:11:21,055 --> 01:11:23,888
l don't want you discussing
this case with her...

881
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:26,256
...in any shape, way or form.

882
01:11:26,427 --> 01:11:28,088
Do l make myself clear?

883
01:11:28,162 --> 01:11:29,322
Crystal, sir.

884
01:11:44,011 --> 01:11:45,273
That help any?

885
01:11:46,047 --> 01:11:48,015
You don't feel fear, do you?

886
01:11:49,183 --> 01:11:52,675
One of those people who thinks
everything happens for a reason.

887
01:11:52,787 --> 01:11:54,721
And we're all ''God's chillun.''

888
01:11:55,122 --> 01:11:55,986
How nice.

889
01:11:56,057 --> 01:11:58,992
l put my ass on the line
to bring you that letter.

890
01:11:59,794 --> 01:12:01,785
Are you gonna help me or not?

891
01:12:06,033 --> 01:12:08,024
''Helen, don't lose your head.''

892
01:12:08,636 --> 01:12:10,763
So, we're on a first-name basis.

893
01:12:12,173 --> 01:12:15,108
ls it a threat?
Does he want to cut off my head?

894
01:12:16,177 --> 01:12:17,769
Dahmer cut off heads.

895
01:12:18,112 --> 01:12:19,170
Kemper.

896
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:22,146
l think Rifkin did.

897
01:12:23,384 --> 01:12:25,079
l'm sorry. lt's difficult.

898
01:12:25,152 --> 01:12:27,211
lt's okay. Take your time.

899
01:12:32,660 --> 01:12:35,151
''First you make a stone of your heart.''

900
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:38,396
That's the first step: disassociation.

901
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:41,566
He's saying he's suffered.
Now it's our turn.

902
01:12:43,638 --> 01:12:45,196
What made a stone of his heart?

903
01:12:45,273 --> 01:12:48,470
Usually it's rejection or humiliation
by a parent.

904
01:12:48,843 --> 01:12:51,073
Gacy's father beat him for fun.

905
01:12:51,279 --> 01:12:55,340
Kemper's mother locked him
in a cellar when he reached puberty.

906
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:57,551
Something happened to this one.

907
01:12:58,586 --> 01:13:00,076
Are these his first killings?

908
01:13:00,154 --> 01:13:01,416
I think they are.

909
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:03,423
He's thought about them.

910
01:13:05,459 --> 01:13:07,256
This guy's copycatting.

911
01:13:07,395 --> 01:13:09,124
He wants what those killers got.

912
01:13:09,196 --> 01:13:12,063
Fame, the power to terrify us....

913
01:13:12,166 --> 01:13:16,227
To take whoever, whatever he wants
without saying, ''Please.''

914
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,274
''And if your hands are still willing,
you can turn murder...

915
01:13:23,444 --> 01:13:24,877
''...into art.''

916
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:27,874
He wants us to think
what he's doing is art.

917
01:13:28,215 --> 01:13:30,843
We're looking for someone
desperate for acceptance.

918
01:13:30,918 --> 01:13:33,716
Probably has a fair academic record.

919
01:13:34,322 --> 01:13:36,381
And l think has a technical job.

920
01:13:37,525 --> 01:13:40,460
Something that demands
a certain precision.

921
01:14:08,589 --> 01:14:11,319
''Flushed with your very first success...

922
01:14:11,425 --> 01:14:14,053
''...you must try a twosome
or a threesome...

923
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:17,594
''...and you'll find your conscience
bothers you much less.''

924
01:14:17,765 --> 01:14:19,494
A gruesome twosome.

925
01:14:19,734 --> 01:14:21,429
Kemper did two in one day.

926
01:14:21,569 --> 01:14:23,434
Bundy did three.

927
01:14:23,938 --> 01:14:28,272
Boston Strangler, Hillside Strangler--
Does the order mean anything?

928
01:14:28,442 --> 01:14:31,434
lt's not chronological.
Son of Sam was before Hillside.

929
01:14:31,512 --> 01:14:34,345
He's sending you letters
like he's daring us to nail him.

930
01:14:34,415 --> 01:14:36,883
lf he wants to be famous,
he must be caught.

931
01:14:36,951 --> 01:14:39,181
So you can write a book about him.

932
01:15:45,686 --> 01:15:47,745
Good grief.

933
01:16:52,353 --> 01:16:54,048
Thanks. Stick around.

934
01:16:58,859 --> 01:17:00,986
lt's lousy, but it's hot.

935
01:17:01,562 --> 01:17:02,358
Thanks.

936
01:17:02,429 --> 01:17:03,828
You all right?

937
01:17:08,068 --> 01:17:09,797
He burnt the print off the finger.

938
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:11,599
What a surprise.

939
01:17:12,039 --> 01:17:14,166
He used it as a bookmark.

940
01:17:14,341 --> 01:17:16,832
The chapter where he attacks the doctor.

941
01:17:17,011 --> 01:17:20,572
We know that Mr. Cullum was safe
in San Quentin last night, so...

942
01:17:20,915 --> 01:17:23,110
...why did this book
show up under the mattress?

943
01:17:23,184 --> 01:17:24,947
l'll give you one better.

944
01:17:26,954 --> 01:17:28,353
lt's autographed.

945
01:17:29,757 --> 01:17:31,850
''Hey Doc, hope you like the book.

946
01:17:31,992 --> 01:17:34,961
''Love and sloppy kisses,
Daryll Lee Cullum.''

947
01:17:35,462 --> 01:17:37,123
What a cuddly.

948
01:17:44,705 --> 01:17:46,468
l know what you'll say.

949
01:17:48,108 --> 01:17:49,666
l'll do the talking.

950
01:17:53,714 --> 01:17:55,306
How you doing?

951
01:17:57,818 --> 01:18:00,878
I want you to look
into this little camera here....

952
01:18:01,655 --> 01:18:04,215
Now I want you to speak
into this microphone.

953
01:18:04,325 --> 01:18:06,293
She'll see me through that?

954
01:18:07,061 --> 01:18:10,030
-How she gonna hear me?
-Speak into the microphone.

955
01:18:10,798 --> 01:18:11,856
Hello.

956
01:18:12,099 --> 01:18:13,327
Hey, Doc.

957
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:20,040
l'm lnspector Monohan.
l'll be speaking for Dr. Hudson.

958
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:21,630
I'm hanging up.

959
01:18:21,842 --> 01:18:23,605
I ain't talking to a cop.

960
01:18:23,811 --> 01:18:27,269
Dr. Hudson just got your book.
Do you know anything about it?

961
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:29,539
I surely do, but...

962
01:18:29,717 --> 01:18:33,209
...that's all I'll say till that foxy lady
gets on the horn.

963
01:18:33,354 --> 01:18:34,548
Put her on.

964
01:18:38,659 --> 01:18:40,024
Hello, Mr. Cullum.

965
01:18:40,094 --> 01:18:41,152
Doc!

966
01:18:42,162 --> 01:18:44,323
I've been expecting your call.

967
01:18:45,299 --> 01:18:47,631
From one author to another,
how'd you like my book?

968
01:18:47,701 --> 01:18:49,965
What do you know
about the man that delivered it?

969
01:18:50,037 --> 01:18:51,231
Peter Kurten?

970
01:18:51,338 --> 01:18:52,771
What about him?

971
01:18:53,073 --> 01:18:54,631
Peter Kurten?

972
01:18:58,012 --> 01:19:02,108
Peter Kurten is the name of a serial killer
from the 30s, in Germany.

973
01:19:02,249 --> 01:19:05,309
Damn, he took that man's name.

974
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:07,280
He bothering you?

975
01:19:07,721 --> 01:19:10,417
He broke into my apartment
to leave your book.

976
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,252
Kind of a hand-delivery?

977
01:19:12,359 --> 01:19:14,088
Did you put him up to it?

978
01:19:14,662 --> 01:19:17,859
This guy, he's written me all these letters.

979
01:19:18,032 --> 01:19:20,000
I figured he owed me a couple of favors.

980
01:19:20,067 --> 01:19:24,003
So I sent a book with him to your house.
I didn't think he'd break in.

981
01:19:24,138 --> 01:19:27,005
Steer clear of him. He's a freak.

982
01:19:27,541 --> 01:19:31,341
He told me he's going to send me
$500 for some of my...spirit.

983
01:19:35,582 --> 01:19:39,074
He said that he can make me immortal
if he had some of my spirit.

984
01:19:39,153 --> 01:19:40,916
You know what I'm saying?

985
01:19:41,588 --> 01:19:43,556
This is embarrassing.

986
01:19:44,024 --> 01:19:47,118
I don't want to say it right out
in front of a lady.

987
01:19:47,428 --> 01:19:50,761
l think l know what you're referring to.
What did you do about it?

988
01:19:50,831 --> 01:19:53,732
I took some liquid soap,
put it in a sandwich baggie...

989
01:19:53,801 --> 01:19:56,702
...with a message from Jesus
to mend his ways.

990
01:19:56,937 --> 01:19:58,700
How will you contact Kurten?

991
01:19:58,772 --> 01:20:03,175
Buddy of mine got paroled.
I'll send the baggie with him.

992
01:20:03,277 --> 01:20:05,336
Kurten will hook up with him.

993
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:07,913
Do you know when and where?

994
01:20:08,015 --> 01:20:09,676
All depends.

995
01:20:09,950 --> 01:20:11,542
Depends on what?

996
01:20:12,086 --> 01:20:14,782
It gets awful lonesome in here, Doc.

997
01:20:15,289 --> 01:20:17,780
I think about you all the time.

998
01:20:19,126 --> 01:20:21,356
A personal token would be nice.

999
01:20:22,596 --> 01:20:23,654
Let's see...

1000
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:24,993
...something...

1001
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:26,530
...feminine...

1002
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:30,161
...something lacy, something frilly,
something pretty.

1003
01:20:31,372 --> 01:20:32,737
I got it.

1004
01:20:33,974 --> 01:20:36,602
Send me some ofyour squirrel covers.

1005
01:20:37,678 --> 01:20:39,145
l beg your pardon?

1006
01:20:39,546 --> 01:20:41,275
''l beg your pardon?''

1007
01:20:41,515 --> 01:20:43,142
Your panties.

1008
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,980
You wear them, don't you?
That's what I want.

1009
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:48,747
I want them autographed personally.

1010
01:20:48,889 --> 01:20:51,119
''Daryll Lee Cullum.'' Deal?

1011
01:20:51,325 --> 01:20:52,690
That's a promise.

1012
01:20:52,793 --> 01:20:58,231
My buddy's meeting Peter tonight at 10:00
at the Denver Meat Packing Company.

1013
01:21:05,172 --> 01:21:06,639
How's life?

1014
01:21:08,242 --> 01:21:11,040
How'd you like to get off
the Chinatown detail?

1015
01:21:11,712 --> 01:21:14,704
We have a lead.
l think we can get this guy.

1016
01:21:14,948 --> 01:21:16,677
Yeah, l'll be right down.

1017
01:21:18,552 --> 01:21:22,886
You've got to come talk to me,
because Jesus kept you alive for a reason.

1018
01:21:23,290 --> 01:21:25,850
He knew Satan was in my heart,
raising my hand to kill you.

1019
01:21:25,926 --> 01:21:29,555
And Satan knew I had
a good six, seven years of appeals...

1020
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:32,224
...before they'd drop the cyanide tablets.

1021
01:21:32,733 --> 01:21:34,997
And I'mjust like Jesus.

1022
01:21:35,602 --> 01:21:37,627
I got disciples, too.

1023
01:21:38,338 --> 01:21:43,207
They're dying to do whatever I ask them,
as long as Ijust say the word, Doc.

1024
01:21:45,245 --> 01:21:47,645
I'm death and life to you, Doc.

1025
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:50,474
Death and life.

1026
01:21:59,059 --> 01:22:02,187
-l speak Mandarin. They're Cantonese.
-How can l get a statement?

1027
01:22:02,262 --> 01:22:03,957
l wish l could help.

1028
01:22:04,031 --> 01:22:05,794
l'll do anything you want.

1029
01:22:15,576 --> 01:22:17,373
You speak English?

1030
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,241
You speaky English?

1031
01:22:21,482 --> 01:22:22,414
Let's go. Get up.

1032
01:22:22,483 --> 01:22:24,110
Fuck you.

1033
01:22:25,786 --> 01:22:27,549
Get your hands off me!

1034
01:22:59,686 --> 01:23:02,484
We're out of here, babe.
Say good night to Hal.

1035
01:23:03,156 --> 01:23:04,145
Good night.

1036
01:23:04,224 --> 01:23:06,454
You're going out in public like that?

1037
01:23:06,527 --> 01:23:09,155
Festival of Love. Power to the people.

1038
01:23:09,229 --> 01:23:11,197
-Hang loose.
-Heavy. Far out.

1039
01:23:11,298 --> 01:23:12,959
Like, psychedelic.

1040
01:23:24,478 --> 01:23:25,467
Doughnut?

1041
01:23:28,015 --> 01:23:29,107
Behave.

1042
01:23:29,383 --> 01:23:31,214
l'll send you to your room.

1043
01:23:31,285 --> 01:23:33,776
There's only glazed.
You can't have the chocolate.

1044
01:23:44,364 --> 01:23:46,764
Everybody take it easy.

1045
01:23:49,536 --> 01:23:51,697
Hold the gun down so it don't go off.

1046
01:23:53,774 --> 01:23:55,241
Put up your weapons!

1047
01:23:55,409 --> 01:23:56,899
Weapons up.

1048
01:23:58,378 --> 01:24:00,676
Easy, easy. Put the gun down.

1049
01:24:00,981 --> 01:24:02,972
Tell him to put the gun down.

1050
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:03,982
l don't know how to say that.

1051
01:24:04,051 --> 01:24:05,450
Take it easy.

1052
01:24:17,130 --> 01:24:18,620
Nobody out that door!

1053
01:25:15,489 --> 01:25:16,478
Freeze!

1054
01:25:16,556 --> 01:25:18,353
-l'm a juvenile!
-Don't move!

1055
01:25:38,945 --> 01:25:40,810
lt's weird, you know?

1056
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:43,681
You think you're going to crash your car...

1057
01:25:43,950 --> 01:25:47,579
...or go out in a blaze of glory
with some big bad guy.

1058
01:25:48,121 --> 01:25:49,486
And what happens?

1059
01:25:49,556 --> 01:25:51,183
Some jerk...

1060
01:25:51,358 --> 01:25:53,724
...forgets to lock his stupid drawer.

1061
01:25:55,495 --> 01:25:59,261
l can't tell you how many times
l saw the two of you together....

1062
01:26:01,968 --> 01:26:06,735
l'd see you with your heads together.
He'd be making some kind of dumb joke.

1063
01:26:14,614 --> 01:26:15,808
l wished....

1064
01:26:21,154 --> 01:26:22,781
l wished him dead.

1065
01:26:23,323 --> 01:26:24,722
Every time.

1066
01:26:29,696 --> 01:26:30,924
You know what?

1067
01:26:31,565 --> 01:26:35,524
The strange thing is,
l'd really give my life right now...

1068
01:26:36,470 --> 01:26:38,062
...to bring him back.

1069
01:26:55,122 --> 01:26:57,488
You're in terrible trouble, Nico.

1070
01:26:57,691 --> 01:26:59,249
Terrible trouble.

1071
01:26:59,493 --> 01:27:01,120
Who gives a fuck?

1072
01:27:03,096 --> 01:27:04,393
l give a fuck.

1073
01:27:15,876 --> 01:27:18,572
You know that in all the years
l've known you...

1074
01:27:18,645 --> 01:27:20,545
...l've never seen you cry.

1075
01:27:26,419 --> 01:27:30,583
He's on paid leave. l managed
to talk the commissioner out of no pay.

1076
01:27:36,696 --> 01:27:38,596
You take his, you take mine.

1077
01:27:38,865 --> 01:27:41,561
Now l'm supposed to lose
three good cops in one day?

1078
01:27:41,635 --> 01:27:42,659
Sir...

1079
01:27:45,705 --> 01:27:48,105
...l tried to control the situation.

1080
01:27:51,178 --> 01:27:53,772
l tried to control it. l made a choice.

1081
01:27:58,084 --> 01:27:59,551
lt didn't work out.

1082
01:28:02,155 --> 01:28:03,747
An officer got killed.

1083
01:28:03,824 --> 01:28:07,316
You made a decision,
and it was the right decision.

1084
01:28:08,128 --> 01:28:10,688
You just got the wrong result. That's all.

1085
01:28:15,101 --> 01:28:17,001
You go out, you get drunk.

1086
01:28:17,971 --> 01:28:19,233
l am.

1087
01:28:25,412 --> 01:28:26,777
We missed him.

1088
01:28:27,147 --> 01:28:29,206
Jesus Christ! How'd that happen?

1089
01:28:29,282 --> 01:28:30,772
lt was my fault.

1090
01:28:31,117 --> 01:28:32,607
l was so stupid.

1091
01:28:37,724 --> 01:28:39,385
We had a problem with....

1092
01:28:39,459 --> 01:28:40,824
Ruben's dead.

1093
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,392
-Come in.
-Not really. l'm okay.

1094
01:28:48,468 --> 01:28:50,163
l thought you ought to hear it
from somebody...

1095
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:52,762
...instead of seeing it on the news,
because...

1096
01:28:52,839 --> 01:28:55,672
...l know that you and he had...

1097
01:28:56,276 --> 01:28:57,538
...a thing.

1098
01:28:59,813 --> 01:29:01,838
No, we didn't.

1099
01:29:05,919 --> 01:29:07,045
He was a...

1100
01:29:07,254 --> 01:29:08,551
...sweet man.

1101
01:29:08,655 --> 01:29:10,418
l thought of him as a boy.

1102
01:29:10,657 --> 01:29:12,557
-Come in.
-No, l'm okay.

1103
01:29:12,626 --> 01:29:13,888
Come in for just a sec.

1104
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,825
Answer the phone.

1105
01:29:15,962 --> 01:29:17,657
Let me tell you something.

1106
01:29:17,797 --> 01:29:21,324
Nine out of ten serial killers
are white males...

1107
01:29:21,735 --> 01:29:24,670
...age 20 to 35,just like these.

1108
01:29:25,572 --> 01:29:29,804
The FBI estimates that there could be
as many as 35 serial killers...

1109
01:29:30,310 --> 01:29:32,870
...cruising for victims even as I speak.

1110
01:29:36,549 --> 01:29:37,777
Peter Kurten?!

1111
01:29:57,337 --> 01:29:58,395
Bitch!

1112
01:30:22,362 --> 01:30:26,059
Get the tap on Hudson's phone
and see if it traced a call two minutes ago.

1113
01:30:26,132 --> 01:30:28,066
There's a tap on my phone?

1114
01:30:28,802 --> 01:30:30,429
Yeah, just this second.

1115
01:30:30,503 --> 01:30:32,801
Don't argue. Just do it.

1116
01:30:32,906 --> 01:30:36,069
ls it possible this guy was
a student of mine?

1117
01:30:36,176 --> 01:30:38,110
Where'd you give this lecture?

1118
01:30:38,178 --> 01:30:41,511
All over the country. Dozens of times.
lt was my stock lecture.

1119
01:30:41,581 --> 01:30:43,947
When was the last time you gave it here?

1120
01:30:44,951 --> 01:30:48,011
Would have been last year, just before--

1121
01:30:48,488 --> 01:30:50,353
l'm getting it.

1122
01:30:52,592 --> 01:30:54,719
That's it. That's the order l gave it.

1123
01:30:54,794 --> 01:30:58,662
''DeSalvo, Bianchi and Buono,
Berkowitz, Dahmer.'' Dahmer's next.

1124
01:30:58,832 --> 01:31:00,857
Which means he'll kill a man
and after that--

1125
01:31:00,934 --> 01:31:02,834
He'll do Ted Bundy.

1126
01:31:05,038 --> 01:31:06,369
The Sound Factory? Perfect.

1127
01:31:06,439 --> 01:31:09,966
l know where it is. l'm going now.
Give me backup.

1128
01:31:12,245 --> 01:31:13,803
Just maybe....

1129
01:31:14,414 --> 01:31:15,472
Maybe.

1130
01:32:51,711 --> 01:32:53,770
He's going to do Ted Bundy next.

1131
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:56,441
That was the last name on the list.

1132
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:59,812
He'll pick the most extravagant murder.

1133
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:02,484
The song talked about a threesome.

1134
01:33:03,056 --> 01:33:06,822
Bundy killed three girls in one night
at that sorority house...

1135
01:33:07,494 --> 01:33:08,961
...Chi Omega.

1136
01:33:10,497 --> 01:33:12,328
He faked injuries.

1137
01:33:12,799 --> 01:33:16,257
He wore a cast on one arm,
and he used crutches...

1138
01:33:17,003 --> 01:33:19,267
...and he asked the girls for help.

1139
01:33:21,908 --> 01:33:23,205
He drove...

1140
01:33:23,843 --> 01:33:26,277
...a very distinctive car. lt was a....

1141
01:33:26,513 --> 01:33:28,174
Gold VW Bug.

1142
01:33:28,314 --> 01:33:30,214
We need to get on the DMV.

1143
01:33:30,383 --> 01:33:34,945
We want records on all gold
or tan-colored VW Bugs, any year.

1144
01:33:36,055 --> 01:33:39,582
I want an in-person check
on every registered owner.

1145
01:33:42,262 --> 01:33:46,460
Anyone who's registered a gold, yellow,
tan or any light-colored VW Bug.

1146
01:33:46,599 --> 01:33:50,126
Contact campus security
at every college within 50 miles.

1147
01:33:50,603 --> 01:33:54,869
They need to warn all female students,
especially those with long hair...

1148
01:33:54,974 --> 01:33:58,933
...to avoid any contact
with males they don't know.

1149
01:34:02,015 --> 01:34:05,746
Report any man with an injury
or a handicap.

1150
01:34:10,223 --> 01:34:12,191
DMV printouts of all Bug owners.

1151
01:34:12,258 --> 01:34:13,657
Beautiful.

1152
01:34:30,610 --> 01:34:31,975
That's him.

1153
01:34:33,012 --> 01:34:36,812
He gave him the drink,
they went onto the dance floor and....

1154
01:34:37,016 --> 01:34:38,347
You're absolutely sure?

1155
01:34:38,418 --> 01:34:39,715
Yeah, that's him.

1156
01:34:39,786 --> 01:34:42,016
Peter Foley, Daly City.

1157
01:35:08,214 --> 01:35:10,148
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

1158
01:35:15,688 --> 01:35:17,019
We've got him.

1159
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:22,690
Call the SWAT team.
l'm not taking any chances with this fuck.

1160
01:35:30,770 --> 01:35:34,069
Kind of defeats the purpose
of my Miracle Bra but...

1161
01:35:34,474 --> 01:35:35,839
...who's looking?

1162
01:35:35,908 --> 01:35:37,603
You're onto him.

1163
01:35:37,744 --> 01:35:38,802
Good work.

1164
01:35:38,945 --> 01:35:40,674
Just horseshit luck.

1165
01:35:40,780 --> 01:35:42,111
l don't think so.

1166
01:35:45,385 --> 01:35:47,444
You take care out there. Okay?

1167
01:35:47,920 --> 01:35:49,581
Don't l always?

1168
01:35:51,991 --> 01:35:53,583
l love you.

1169
01:35:54,460 --> 01:35:55,654
You know?

1170
01:35:59,032 --> 01:36:00,192
l know.

1171
01:36:15,648 --> 01:36:17,980
Looking good, team leader.

1172
01:36:21,487 --> 01:36:23,387
This is a status ''David.''

1173
01:36:23,523 --> 01:36:24,820
Go, team leader.

1174
01:36:24,891 --> 01:36:27,519
Peter Foley, this is the police.

1175
01:36:27,994 --> 01:36:29,757
Come to the front door.

1176
01:36:29,829 --> 01:36:32,730
Come out with your hands
above your head.

1177
01:36:36,202 --> 01:36:40,229
Team leader, we have a fire
in the basement window.

1178
01:36:40,340 --> 01:36:42,467
This is status ''George.'' This is go.

1179
01:37:47,039 --> 01:37:50,133
Lieutenant, can you tell us
what happened here tonight?

1180
01:37:50,410 --> 01:37:55,074
San Francisco Police developed evidence
that identified the killer...

1181
01:37:55,348 --> 01:37:58,146
...known in the media
as ''The Copycat Killer''...

1182
01:37:58,418 --> 01:38:02,980
...as one Peter Foley,
who lived at this address.

1183
01:38:03,222 --> 01:38:07,124
When Mr. Foley was asked
to step outside to be interviewed...

1184
01:38:07,226 --> 01:38:10,161
...it's believed that he set fire
to the residence.

1185
01:38:18,504 --> 01:38:21,632
Don't tell me you both want
to use the men's room.

1186
01:38:40,426 --> 01:38:41,757
Hiya, Helen.

1187
01:38:45,164 --> 01:38:47,155
l got your invitation...

1188
01:38:47,400 --> 01:38:48,765
...and l accept.

1189
01:38:48,835 --> 01:38:50,234
Helen, it's MJ.

1190
01:38:50,336 --> 01:38:53,169
I'm sure you heard on your scanner
it was a mess.

1191
01:38:53,706 --> 01:38:55,901
I know it's late, but I'm coming over.

1192
01:38:55,975 --> 01:38:57,442
That's perfect.

1193
01:38:57,510 --> 01:39:00,070
That is perfect, Helen.

1194
01:39:00,246 --> 01:39:02,680
Sounds like we have company coming.

1195
01:39:03,249 --> 01:39:05,183
l'm not going to lie to you.

1196
01:39:08,454 --> 01:39:09,944
This is gonna hurt.

1197
01:39:51,764 --> 01:39:53,925
This is lnspector Monohan, Homicide.

1198
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:58,437
l'm at Pier One, Fort Mason. l've got
an officer down. l need assistance.

1199
01:39:58,504 --> 01:39:59,971
Copy, Monohan.

1200
01:41:32,632 --> 01:41:33,997
Up we go.

1201
01:41:37,336 --> 01:41:38,963
Oh, hi there.

1202
01:41:39,305 --> 01:41:42,001
Wejoin our program already in progress.

1203
01:41:43,609 --> 01:41:45,099
Inspector Monohan...

1204
01:41:45,845 --> 01:41:47,870
...don't you ever get tired...

1205
01:41:47,980 --> 01:41:50,244
...being a day late and $1 short?

1206
01:41:52,218 --> 01:41:56,245
You probably think I'm going
to slit her throat right now.

1207
01:41:57,056 --> 01:41:59,183
Cut my losses, so to speak.

1208
01:42:02,194 --> 01:42:03,821
Wrong-o!

1209
01:42:04,263 --> 01:42:08,359
Do you really think
I'd get her all dressed up, so pretty...

1210
01:42:09,835 --> 01:42:11,427
...with no place to go?

1211
01:42:13,572 --> 01:42:15,369
Ifyou're a smart cop...

1212
01:42:15,608 --> 01:42:17,599
...you'll know where to find us.

1213
01:42:17,677 --> 01:42:20,441
And ifyou're a really smart cop...

1214
01:42:20,613 --> 01:42:22,274
...you'll come alone.

1215
01:42:24,884 --> 01:42:26,283
Otherwise...

1216
01:42:27,286 --> 01:42:28,844
...it's bye-bye Helen.

1217
01:42:30,690 --> 01:42:32,123
See you.

1218
01:43:28,314 --> 01:43:30,111
No, this is wrong.

1219
01:43:32,685 --> 01:43:34,516
Here we go, Helen.

1220
01:43:35,121 --> 01:43:36,611
There we go.

1221
01:43:36,756 --> 01:43:38,451
Much better.

1222
01:43:38,958 --> 01:43:40,289
What about him?

1223
01:43:41,260 --> 01:43:42,955
Did l get the pose right?

1224
01:43:43,195 --> 01:43:46,653
Did the best l could from the photos.
Come on, help me out.

1225
01:43:47,166 --> 01:43:50,135
Which way was his head?
This way, or this way?

1226
01:43:54,039 --> 01:43:55,165
This way.

1227
01:43:55,541 --> 01:43:57,133
Good. Excellent.

1228
01:43:57,243 --> 01:43:59,803
Everything has to be just so.

1229
01:44:03,082 --> 01:44:04,879
God, Helen, l remember...

1230
01:44:05,184 --> 01:44:07,812
...watching you on the big screen.

1231
01:44:08,120 --> 01:44:09,712
ln your red dress.

1232
01:44:09,789 --> 01:44:11,723
God, you looked huge.

1233
01:44:12,525 --> 01:44:13,924
Look at you now.

1234
01:44:14,093 --> 01:44:15,822
So sad.

1235
01:44:16,362 --> 01:44:18,523
But, look on the bright side.

1236
01:44:19,131 --> 01:44:22,066
l'm going to make you
the world's most famous victim.

1237
01:44:23,536 --> 01:44:25,504
Guess what that makes me?

1238
01:44:26,739 --> 01:44:30,903
Did you know that more books have
been written about Jack the Ripper...

1239
01:44:31,644 --> 01:44:33,407
...than Abraham Lincoln?

1240
01:44:42,421 --> 01:44:44,252
lt's a sick world...

1241
01:44:44,356 --> 01:44:45,846
...isn't it, Helen?

1242
01:44:51,831 --> 01:44:54,265
We are not to go in there alone.

1243
01:44:54,533 --> 01:44:56,398
You wait for proper backup.

1244
01:44:56,468 --> 01:44:58,629
And you acknowledge my order!

1245
01:44:58,704 --> 01:45:02,640
You stay out of that building
until backup arrives! You copy?

1246
01:45:02,708 --> 01:45:04,107
Absolutely, sir.

1247
01:45:40,145 --> 01:45:41,976
Careful, Helen.

1248
01:45:44,416 --> 01:45:45,405
See?

1249
01:45:47,686 --> 01:45:50,052
Now you've cut yourself, haven't you?

1250
01:45:55,794 --> 01:45:58,126
See, l've been practicing.

1251
01:46:01,267 --> 01:46:03,098
Want to know the trick?

1252
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:06,228
Small...

1253
01:46:07,072 --> 01:46:08,596
...incisions...

1254
01:46:10,943 --> 01:46:12,501
...with a fine...

1255
01:46:13,178 --> 01:46:14,406
...instrument.

1256
01:46:16,348 --> 01:46:17,781
That way...

1257
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:19,579
...l can make it last...

1258
01:46:19,718 --> 01:46:21,345
...for hours.

1259
01:46:22,121 --> 01:46:25,522
You will not believe
how long a minute can feel.

1260
01:46:30,195 --> 01:46:31,628
Fuck you.

1261
01:46:33,232 --> 01:46:34,290
What?

1262
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:36,368
You heard me, you little twerp.

1263
01:46:36,835 --> 01:46:38,632
You think l'm afraid of you?

1264
01:46:39,538 --> 01:46:41,028
l know you are.

1265
01:46:41,340 --> 01:46:43,535
l know all about you.

1266
01:46:44,243 --> 01:46:45,870
You're just a sad...

1267
01:46:46,078 --> 01:46:47,670
...second-rate...

1268
01:46:47,880 --> 01:46:51,111
...boring, impotent little copycat.

1269
01:46:54,186 --> 01:46:55,983
Watch it, bitch!

1270
01:46:56,088 --> 01:46:59,489
Or l will slice that smile
off your face, do you hear me?

1271
01:46:59,725 --> 01:47:02,956
-Daryll Lee couldn't get it up, either.
-Do you hear me?!

1272
01:47:15,307 --> 01:47:17,741
l see, Helen. Nice try.

1273
01:47:18,477 --> 01:47:20,342
Want to know a secret?

1274
01:47:20,913 --> 01:47:22,380
l'm onto your trick.

1275
01:47:23,282 --> 01:47:25,216
l won't kill you fast.

1276
01:47:25,951 --> 01:47:27,748
No matter how much...

1277
01:47:28,120 --> 01:47:29,781
...you gonna want me to.

1278
01:47:45,971 --> 01:47:47,268
Excellent.

1279
01:47:47,373 --> 01:47:49,705
Here's where Daryll Lee got sloppy.

1280
01:47:54,046 --> 01:47:56,276
He wasn't expecting a second cop.

1281
01:47:56,348 --> 01:47:58,213
-But l am.
-l'm in here!

1282
01:47:58,650 --> 01:47:59,844
Helen, relax.

1283
01:48:00,219 --> 01:48:03,120
The other cop's collecting his pension.
So will she.

1284
01:48:04,256 --> 01:48:06,952
But if you warn her, l'll kill her.

1285
01:48:16,268 --> 01:48:19,567
This is lnspector Monohan.
l have a message for Quinn.

1286
01:48:19,772 --> 01:48:20,830
Go ahead.

1287
01:48:20,906 --> 01:48:22,237
Tell him...

1288
01:48:22,541 --> 01:48:24,202
...l'm sorry, l blew it.

1289
01:49:47,292 --> 01:49:49,920
Now, that's my gun, isn't it?

1290
01:49:50,095 --> 01:49:52,188
What in the world are you doing...

1291
01:49:53,232 --> 01:49:54,893
...with my gun?

1292
01:49:56,235 --> 01:49:57,862
Get your ass over here.

1293
01:49:58,403 --> 01:50:01,065
Come on, Doc,
help me out in this situation.

1294
01:50:01,473 --> 01:50:03,839
What do l do? Do l stick her or shoot her?

1295
01:50:03,909 --> 01:50:05,740
Shoot her or stick her, huh?

1296
01:50:05,811 --> 01:50:07,142
Come on, help me.

1297
01:50:48,053 --> 01:50:50,954
You watch this, Helen. You watching?

1298
01:50:51,924 --> 01:50:54,051
Perfect symmetry here.

1299
01:50:54,927 --> 01:50:57,225
Get up here. You watching?

1300
01:50:58,497 --> 01:51:00,089
You watching this?

1301
01:51:06,238 --> 01:51:08,433
Helen, what are you doing? No!

1302
01:51:11,109 --> 01:51:12,303
Feet on here!

1303
01:51:23,088 --> 01:51:24,077
Damn it!

1304
01:51:33,031 --> 01:51:36,523
Good try, Helen.
But you don't get off that easy.

1305
01:51:37,169 --> 01:51:39,160
Come on, get up. Let's go.

1306
01:51:39,338 --> 01:51:40,771
Get up, bitch.

1307
01:52:08,967 --> 01:52:10,298
Shit!

1308
01:52:25,484 --> 01:52:27,714
Help us! Somebody!

1309
01:53:14,266 --> 01:53:15,358
Somebody!

1310
01:53:15,467 --> 01:53:16,593
Help us!

1311
01:53:25,711 --> 01:53:28,043
Looks like l cured the agoraphobia.

1312
01:53:29,047 --> 01:53:30,742
Help us! Help!

1313
01:53:31,750 --> 01:53:32,944
Forget it!

1314
01:53:33,518 --> 01:53:34,883
Too late!

1315
01:53:35,220 --> 01:53:37,882
Too late for you, Helen!

1316
01:53:53,905 --> 01:53:55,736
Put up your dukes!

1317
01:53:57,476 --> 01:53:59,910
What the fuck are you laughing at, bitch?

1318
01:54:03,382 --> 01:54:05,247
What are you laughing at?!

1319
01:54:06,585 --> 01:54:08,314
What're you waiting for?

1320
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:09,814
Go ahead.

1321
01:55:53,158 --> 01:55:55,126
Dear Conrad....

1322
01:55:55,327 --> 01:55:57,192
Thank you for your letter.

1323
01:55:57,262 --> 01:55:58,490
Praise the Lord.

1324
01:55:58,563 --> 01:56:02,795
I know you must be so happy
that He chose to spare Dr. Hudson.

1325
01:56:04,002 --> 01:56:07,028
The Big Guy moves
in mysterious ways, don't He?

1326
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:10,970
Itjust so happens
I'm awaiting the arrival...

1327
01:56:11,042 --> 01:56:14,705
...of a pair of genuine
Helen Hudson undies...

1328
01:56:15,514 --> 01:56:17,414
...signed personal to me.

1329
01:56:18,350 --> 01:56:21,217
A real collector's item,
I'm sure you'll know.

1330
01:56:22,220 --> 01:56:23,585
They're yours.

1331
01:56:23,688 --> 01:56:26,919
But don't forget,
a disciple must be strong...

1332
01:56:27,025 --> 01:56:29,493
...if he is to succeed where others fail.

1333
01:56:30,595 --> 01:56:34,497
Peter strayed from the path
and the Lord smote him good.

1334
01:56:35,534 --> 01:56:36,933
So keep it simple.

1335
01:56:38,069 --> 01:56:39,627
Then glory is yours...

1336
01:56:39,771 --> 01:56:42,171
...and vengeance is mine...

1337
01:56:42,674 --> 01:56:44,369
...as the Good Book says.

1338
01:56:45,477 --> 01:56:47,342
I know you'll get my meaning.

1339
01:56:52,817 --> 01:56:54,614
Happy hunting, partner.

1340
01:56:55,887 --> 01:56:57,252
Daryll Lee Cullum.
