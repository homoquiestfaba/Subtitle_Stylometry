1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,800


2
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,500
Moron.

3
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,400
Putz. Where are they biting?

4
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,600
Pop says that he spotted
Catfish Hunter at Indian Slough.

5
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,100
Catfish Hunter?
Maybe this is the year we catch him!

6
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,300
Where do you get that "we" crap?

7
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,300
That fish belongs to me.

8
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,400
I'll let you visit him
when he's mounted on my wall!

9
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,800
Honey?

10
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,200
You forgot your Thermos.

11
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Hi, Ariel.

12
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,400
See you later.

13
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,700
That's my fish!

14
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,800
Come on, just one good bite.

15
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,800
I got you!

16
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,300
Hey, dickhead!

17
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,000
Turn that radio down!

18
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,600
You're scaring all the fish away!

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,500
Turn the damn radio down, will you?

20
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,000
Who put a bug up your ass?

21
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,500
I saw him.

22
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,700
Catfish Hunter?

23
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,000
After I dropped anchor,
he stuck his head up over by that log.

24
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,400
He just looked at me, smiled,
and swam down into the mud.

25
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
He smiled?

26
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,500
Holy moly! How big is he this year?

27
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:09,500
He's the size of a Buick. I would've
had him if you hadn't shown up.

28
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,200
You couldn't catch crabs
from a $10 hooker.

29
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
How is your sister?

30
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,200
I saw Sven down at the dam.

31
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,000
He's says there's a rumor...

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,700
...that Rick Ragetti's cousin's
coming to buy Chuck's Bait.

33
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,100
An Italian running Chuck's?

34
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,800
We'll have the first mob-run
bait shop in Wabasha.

35
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,800
What are you doing?

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,700
I was here first.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,100
I got just as much right
to be here as you do!

38
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,800
You got bad luck.
You'll infect my spot.

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,400
Find your own hole!

40
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,800
Holy moly! You got a fart
in your brain or something?

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,700
And turn that down!

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,000
Where you going?

43
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,800
Not far.

44
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,900
What's the matter with that guy?
Getting goofier every year.

45
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:20,500
You don't have the balls
to take me on anymore!

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,700
Ariel's had you neutered!

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,700
Let's see what you're made of!

48
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
Let that be a lesson to you!

49
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,000
You putz!

50
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,000
All right, you chicken-livered schmeer.

51
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,100
Get out of here!

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,200
Isn't it beautiful?

53
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,300
The lava lamp?

54
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,100
The angel.

55
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,900
Ariel says he watches over the house.

56
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:06,400
Don't get too used to him. Our house
will be ready soon, then we're gone.

57
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,800
How long have you been up?

58
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,900
For a while.

59
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:15,800
What'd you do?

60
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,000
Watched you.

61
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,500
I'm up!

62
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,400
-Yes, you are!
-Morning, honey.

63
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,000
Go downstairs.
I'll be right out to make you breakfast.

64
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,800
She hates me.

65
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,200
She doesn't hate you.
She just doesn't like you very much.

66
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,100
I'll check out some reception halls
for the wedding.

67
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,900
I talked to Pop.

68
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,000
-He's already booked a place.
-He did?

69
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,000
That's great.

70
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
Did he get the Radisson?

71
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
No.

72
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,400
The Dance Hall?

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,000
That would've been great. But no.

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,900
The Majestic Ballroom?

75
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,500
Not even close.

76
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,300
What's left?

77
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,700
Slippery's Tavern.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,100
You're serious?

79
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,200
I know it's not what we wanted.

80
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,100
It's been my dream to have it in a bar
with peanut shells on the floor.

81
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,600
It's a tavern.

82
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,600
It's a bar.

83
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,900
I'll call him to cancel.
We'll find a place.

84
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,800
Forget it.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,400
Are you sure?

86
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,200
It was my idea
to let them help plan the wedding.

87
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,000
It was a great idea.

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,400
It is nice to see them getting along.

89
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
Amazing how well they're getting along.

90
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,000
What, "ha?"

91
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:56,900
Remember "ha?"

92
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,500
You didn't win. I quit.
I got better things to do.

93
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,700
Really? What?

94
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,400
We got a wedding to plan.

95
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,500
Remember?

96
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:05,800
How can I forget?

97
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,100
See you later, John!

98
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:10,400
See you later, Max.

99
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,100
Hey, Pop.

100
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,200
He's here.

101
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,700
Catfish Hunter?

102
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,800
He's by the sandbar.

103
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,000
You know the damn fish
is older than I am?

104
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,300
Thanks.

105
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,200
What the hell is this?

106
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,800
That's light beer.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I weight ninety goddamn pounds
and you bring me this slopping foam?

108
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:52,200
Ariel's got me on a diet
because my cholesterol's too high.

109
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,500
Let me tell you something, Johnnie.

110
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,900
Last Thursday I turned 95 years old.

111
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,500
And I never exercised a day in my life.

112
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,600
Every morning, I wake up...

113
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
...and I smoke a cigarette.

114
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400
And then I eat five strips of bacon.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,200
And for lunch, I eat a bacon sandwich.

116
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,500
And for a midday snack....

117
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,700
Bacon.

118
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,000
A whole damn plate!

119
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:24,100
And I usually drink my dinner.

120
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,400
According to all of them...

121
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,300
...flat-belly experts...

122
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:32,400
...I should've took a dirt nap
like 30 years ago!

123
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,800
But each year comes and goes
and I'm still here.

124
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,200
And they keep dying.

125
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,500
You know?

126
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,900
Sometimes I wonder...

127
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,300
...if God forgot about me.

128
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,000
It just goes to show you, huh?

129
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,700
What?

130
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,300
Goes to show you what?

131
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,800
What the hell are you talking about?

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,900
You said you drink beer,
you eat bacon...

133
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,900
...and you smoke cigarettes,
and outlive the experts.

134
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,300
Yeah?

135
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,900
I thought there's a moral.

136
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,100
No, there ain't no moral.

137
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,600
I just like that story.

138
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
That's all.

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,500
I like that story.

140
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,200
Good afternoon.

141
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
It's good to see you too.

142
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,200
Aren't you beautiful today?

143
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,300
Are you thirsty?

144
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,700
There we go. Drink up!

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,300
Drink up.

146
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,700
That's right.

147
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,700
There we go, there we go.
Drink up.

148
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,400
Isn't it a glorious afternoon?

149
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,000
It's not bad.

150
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,400
You okay? Feeling all right?

151
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,900
Splendid. Why?

152
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,000
I couldn't help noticing
you were talking to flowers.

153
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,400
Plants and flowers
are living organisms and...

154
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,200
...they respond to voice and touch
like any other creature would.

155
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,500
You should try it yourself.

156
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,400
I got a cactus in my bathroom,
but we got nothing to say.

157
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,300
I better get going.

158
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
See you.

159
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,500
I'm cooking Cantonese tonight.
Why don't you join us?

160
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,500
Well, I already made other plans.

161
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,400
Are you sure?

162
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,000
Thanks, anyway.

163
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,600
Appreciate it.

164
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:48,800
What happens when Bonnie and Clyde
turn out to be Bonnie and Bonnie?

165
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
"Lesbian Bandits" next on Geraldo.

166
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
Lesbians. Yummy.

167
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Yeah, but I like those.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Can I do this?

169
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,000
You've got to wait.

170
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,600
Why don't we put everything in?

171
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,700
Yeah, throw it all in there.

172
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,400
I need to borrow a screwdriver.

173
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,100
Hi, Jacob. You been here long?

174
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
-No.
-Phillips.

175
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,000
Isn't it time you started dating again?

176
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,000
Who with?

177
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,500
Florence Gilbert, for example,
thinks you're quite a catch.

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,300
She looks like Ernest Borgnine.

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,700
Is that so bad?

180
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,400
What about Jane Clark?

181
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,800
"Jane of the Jungle."

182
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,700
Got more body hair than I do. She's
a furbearing mammal, for Godsakes!

183
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,600
Doris Zabrinski?

184
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,800
I know she's a little heavy
but she loves to fish.

185
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,500
Doris Zabrinski...

186
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,600
...is dead.

187
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,800
She is?

188
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,400
She choked to death
on a stack of pancakes two weeks ago...

189
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,400
...at the Lions Club charity breakfast.

190
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
I think it's how
she would have wanted to go.

191
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,500
Listen to me...

192
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,800
...you can't sit around waiting
for another Ariel to come by.

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Thanks for the Phillips.

194
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,200
Remember when you were a kid...

195
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,400
...your mother baked
that rhubarb pie for my birthday?

196
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,400
She swelled up like a balloon.

197
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
Broke out in hives.

198
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,600
She didn't know she was allergic.

199
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,600
She knew!

200
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,900
She baked it anyway
because she knew it was my favorite.

201
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,500
Why'd you think of that?

202
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,000
I don't know.

203
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,400
I think about
things like that all the time.

204
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,600
You all right?

205
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Get out and let me watch my program.

206
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,700
Close the door when you go.

207
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,200
I don't want mosquitoes in here.

208
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,700
They're crazy about
my macaroni and cheese dish.

209
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,600
Hello?

210
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Anybody here?

211
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,800
Hey, wait a second!

212
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
My name is Max Goldman.

213
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,500
Would you relax!

214
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Mama, what are you doing?

215
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,200
I'm going to whack him!

216
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,600
-Put it down!
-He try to steal the vino rosso!

217
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,700
You think everyone's doing that!

218
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,200
-They are!
-This is a small town.

219
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,800
You can trust people here.

220
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
Like Antonio?

221
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,300
Next time he touch vino...

222
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,900
...I whack his head like a melon!

223
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,800
Holy moly.

224
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,500
I'm so sorry.

225
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,200
My mother is a little bit
too protective of the wine.

226
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,200
So I noticed.

227
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,000
She crushed the grapes
herself in Palermo.

228
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,700
It's a rare vintage
with unique bouquet.

229
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,700
Is that a nice way of saying
that the wine smells like her feet?

230
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,100
No.

231
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,300
My name's Max Goldman.
I live in the area here.

232
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,000
Maria Sofia Colletta Ragetti.

233
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,600
That's quite a name.

234
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,600
You're Spaghetti Ragetti's cousin!

235
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Yeah. Why so surprised?

236
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:38,200
Holy moly.

237
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:43,200
I thought.... I was expecting
someone that looked like Rick.

238
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
How's that?

239
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,900
You know, fat, hairy, homely.

240
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,700
But you're not so fat.

241
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,000
You're a smooth talker.

242
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,400
There's more where that
came from, Miss Ragetti.

243
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:59,600
When is the bait shop going to be
back in business?

244
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,100
Bait shop?

245
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,700
What's that?

246
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,900
That's what we call it in Minnesota.

247
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:10,100
-What do you call it where you're from?
-We call it, I think, ristorante.

248
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Ristorante.

249
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,200
You mean you're going to turn this
into a restaurant?

250
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,700
You can't be serious.

251
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,800
Why not?

252
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,500
There's going to be a lot of noise here,
people coming.

253
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
Driving with cars.

254
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,000
You'll scare the fish.

255
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,800
This is the land of 10,000 lakes.
Go find another one.

256
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,600
You're wasting your time,
I'm telling you.

257
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:38,000
People are not going
to come down here for Italian...

258
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,700
...when we got
a Chuck E. Cheese in town.

259
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:43,400
Listen, I don't know
this Cheese person.

260
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,000
But Ragetti's will be
a romantic lakefront ristorante.

261
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,800
It will be special,
classy...somewhere...

262
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,200
...you would never go.

263
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,800
You can say that again.

264
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,900
There's so much to do
before the opening of my ristorante.

265
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,400
Bait shop.

266
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,500
Ristorante.

267
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,800
Bait-a shoppie!

268
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:17,700
You should've let me whack him!

269
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,900
I'm done.

270
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,600
Pop, I wish you'd try
the low-fat bacon.

271
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,300
You can wish in one hand,
and crap in the other...

272
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,700
...and see which gets filled first.

273
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:38,000
This wagon's got to get filled first.
I'll be back.

274
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,500
Pick me up a pack of Camels.

275
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,400
All right, you got it.

276
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,500
You need a hand with that?

277
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:00,000
My name's Gustafson.

278
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Francesca Ragetti.

279
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,000
Italian girl.

280
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,600
Why don't you come back to my place?

281
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,000
I'll show you my cannelloni.

282
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,000
-Hi, Chris.
-How you doing?

283
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,000
Fine.

284
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,900
Ox!

285
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,100
Nag!

286
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,400
-Hey, moron.
-Putz. I've been looking for you!

287
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,900
-Why? What's so important?
-That.

288
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
Jeez Louise, who is that?

289
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,400
That's Spaghetti Ragetti's cousin.

290
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,000
You mean she's going to run
the bait shop?

291
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,100
Ristorante.

292
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,900
Forget about leaving your boat there.
It's all private property.

293
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,000
Chuck'd be spinning in his grave
if he knew about this.

294
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,300
You can say that again.

295
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,700
I guess there's nothing much we can do.

296
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,200
You're just going to stand there
and let all this happen?

297
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,500
I've been fishing that spot ever since
I'm 5 years old. It's all I got left.

298
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,300
What can I do about it?

299
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,400
We must come up with a plan.

300
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,800
We must find a way
to put the kibosh on all this mess.

301
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,100
It's okay!

302
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm a doctor!

303
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,700
Sounds like Dad's using
his "free exam" trick again.

304
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,300
You got to stick with what works.

305
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,400
Ask Jacob if he can pull some strings
with the city council.

306
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,400
Find out what day this ristorante
has its health inspection.

307
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,400
I think I got an idea.

308
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,000
That's good thinking.

309
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Dad!

310
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,300
Max is right. Our fishing spot
will be totally ruined.

311
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
They may as well drain the lake!

312
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,600
Stop moving.

313
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,200
You know the sign she put up?
"Parking for restaurant customers only."

314
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,200
Just a little while longer.

315
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,000
Maybe they'll have
a grease fire in the kitchen.

316
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,800
A guy can dream, can't he?

317
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:19,300
You got to let this thing go, honey.
Got to let it go.

318
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,300
Chuck is gone, the bait shop
is gone, things move on.

319
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,400
I suggest you do the same.

320
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,600
Stop fidgeting!

321
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,800
I don't know why the hell I ever
let you talk me into doing this.

322
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,500
If Max could see me now,
I'd never live it down.

323
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,400
Would you relax?
We're the only ones here.

324
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,800
No one's here but you and me.

325
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
What a putz.

326
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,400
Will you look at that poor man?

327
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,600
And then the mama bear said:

328
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,100
"Somebody's been sleeping
in my bed too."

329
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,600
And finally, the baby bear...

330
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,100
...looked and said,
"Somebody's been sleeping in my bed...

331
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,500
...and the bastard's still there."

332
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,000
But Goldilocks
had a Remington semiautomatic...

333
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,800
...with a scope and a hair-trigger.

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,900
That's not the way it goes.

335
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,500
That was the end...

336
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
...of the three bears.

337
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,800
Sing me a lullaby.

338
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,500
It's too late.

339
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,400
Please!

340
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Stars shining bright above you

341
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Light breezes seem
to whisper, "I love you"

342
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,800
Birds singing in the sycamore tree

343
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,800
Dream...

344
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,200
...a little dream of me

345
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Say nighty-night

346
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
Kiss me

347
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:05,600
Just hug me tight

348
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,600
And tell me you'll miss me

349
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,600
While stars are shining

350
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Bright as can be

351
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,100
Dream a little dream of me

352
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,800
Good night, sweet pea.

353
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,000
Good night.

354
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,200
Happy dreams.

355
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,300
That leaves Uncle Willy
sitting next to the plant lady.

356
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,800
I'm not sticking
the plant lady next to him.

357
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,100
Why not?

358
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:30,700
Because he's a groper.
He'll be all over her.

359
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,100
He's not a groper.
He's a touchy-feely person.

360
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,100
He's not going to be touchy-feely
with the plant lady.

361
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:41,400
She's not a close friend. We don't
know her name. "The plant lady."

362
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,200
She's still important.

363
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:44,700
Fine.

364
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:45,800
Good.

365
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Don't put the quarter in your mouth.

366
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,700
You're not my dad.

367
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,800
What is that?

368
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,700
A bacon sandwich.

369
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,400
What are you doing?

370
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,300
Finishing the seating arrangement.

371
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,000
You don't have to.
Max and I already have a plan.

372
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,600
You guys have done
way too much already.

373
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,500
Hello, children.

374
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,000
Hey, moron.

375
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,500
Putz.

376
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,400
You...

377
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,600
...find the rat?

378
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,700
No, but Allie said
we can borrow Sparky.

379
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,900
What if he gets away?

380
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,400
I made a leash.

381
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,200
Good thinking.

382
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,300
What are you going to do?

383
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,700
Wait.

384
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
I don't want to know.

385
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,200
-It's men talk.
-See you later.

386
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,700
Where's the quarter?

387
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,200
Did you swallow a quarter?

388
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,500
I'll call a doctor.

389
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Relax!

390
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,400
Kids swallow quarters all the time.

391
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,400
Sure! If she craps out
two dimes and a nickel...

392
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,400
...then you can start worrying, huh?

393
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,600
Come here.

394
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,600
Personally clean every little corner.

395
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
Just look.

396
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,000
Like a mirror.

397
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,700
Miss Ragetti, everything appears
to be up to our standards.

398
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,400
I'm very glad.

399
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
Of course, appearances
can be deceiving.

400
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,400
We'll see. We'll see.

401
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,200
What do you think?

402
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
Unleash the beast.

403
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,700
You will be wearing your hairnet
when you're cooking?

404
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,200
What did she say?

405
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,100
She said, "Yes, sir, of course."

406
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,000
Everything seems to be in order.

407
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
-Act rabid.
-Be rabid.

408
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
Good luck to you in there, schmuck.

409
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
It's a rat!

410
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,600
A rat? Here?

411
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,700
Vermin infestation!

412
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm writing you up.

413
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Wait!

414
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,400
It's not a rat, it's a--

415
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,600
It's a guinea pig.

416
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,400
It's a guinea pig.

417
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,900
What are the chances that a guinea pig
would run through here...

418
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,700
...on an inspection day?

419
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,200
Well, lately, I must say
that the chances are pretty good.

420
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,500
Ox.

421
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,800
Nag.

422
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,600
I don't think we've met.

423
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,400
I'm Maria Ragetti.

424
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
John Gustafson.

425
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,600
You like Italian, Mr. Gustafson?

426
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,000
Yeah, I guess so. Why?

427
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,900
Arrivederci, boys.

428
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,200
Should we ask her
for some garlic bread?

429
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,800
How could I be so wrong?

430
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,100
You have a gift.

431
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,200
Not one customer all day.

432
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,600
I mean, besides him.

433
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,500
More vino, señorita!

434
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,500
You go.

435
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,500
It's your turn.

436
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I put his bib on.

437
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,300
What's the matter, beautiful?

438
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,400
You're meaner than a dog...

439
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,800
...shitting tacks.

440
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,100
We put everything into this place!

441
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,800
We could have retired in Hawaii!

442
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,800
I have been to Hawaii.

443
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Which island?

444
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
Come-on-l-want-to-lay-you.

445
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,900
I find you disgusting.

446
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
Just as long
as you find me, dear.

447
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,300
You want to join me, Miss Ragetti?

448
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,300
What the hell.

449
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,900
That a girl.

450
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,800
Ding, dong, the witch is dead.

451
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
Here's to us.

452
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
And to those like us.

453
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,300
Yeah, there's damn few of us left.

454
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,300
That's a damn good thing.

455
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,700
To Chuck.

456
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,700
May his bait shop never die.

457
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
Get dressed!

458
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,400
We go to town.

459
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,100
Praise the Lord!

460
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,200
Holy moly.

461
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,400
Is this seat taken?

462
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,600
Beware.

463
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,400
The devil is a beautiful lady
in a red dress.

464
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,600
Can I get you something, ma'am?

465
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,000
Yes, please. It's so hot in here.

466
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,600
Maybe some...

467
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,100
...water will cool me down.

468
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,300
I've been thinking...

469
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,000
...it's such a shame
we got off on the wrong foot.

470
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,200
It's a shame.

471
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:31,000
I'll bet if we give it
another chance, we could...

472
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,700
...become good friends.

473
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,000
Friends?

474
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,100
Or maybe...

475
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,200
...even more than friends.

476
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,100
Go easy. Go easy, baby.

477
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,700
This feels so much better.

478
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,600
So nice.

479
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,200
So cool.

480
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:56,600
So nice.

481
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
How do you feel?

482
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,200
Friendly, friendly.

483
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,200
I wish I could feel like you...

484
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,700
...but this silly feud of ours
has got me so upset.

485
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,200
What silly feud of ours?

486
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,400
It's a tiny little ristorante.

487
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,300
You will never even know...

488
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,700
...it's there.

489
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,700
Ristorante...

490
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,200
...never!

491
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,300
You are a stubborn man!

492
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,400
Ragetti's will be
a very great success!

493
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,900
You shall see!

494
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,900
Not in my lifetime!

495
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:33,900
You evil temptress!

496
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,400
Maria Ragetti?

497
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,800
How do you know who I am?

498
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,000
You do sort of stand out
in a town like this.

499
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,200
I don't usually dress like this.

500
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,800
You look very nice.

501
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,800
I look like...

502
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
...a slut.

503
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,000
But a nice slut.

504
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:03,700
I want to introduce myself.
My name is Ariel Gustafson.

505
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,700
I want to say how sorry I am for what
Max and John are putting you through.

506
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,200
You know how some people
have trouble saying good-bye?

507
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,900
Believe me,
it has nothing to do with you.

508
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,800
Why do you say such nice things?
You don't even know me.

509
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,000
Because I know what it's like
to be the new kid in town.

510
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,300
Here comes another one.

511
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,800
Hello, boys.

512
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,500
Honey, how was class?

513
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,000
You two must be happy with yourselves.

514
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,000
I just ran into Maria
and she's in tears.

515
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,000
She thinks everybody hates her.

516
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,100
She's right.

517
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:45,700
John, I want you to go right down
to Ragetti's and apologize.

518
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,700
For what?

519
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,000
We tried to tell her.

520
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,600
She should've listened to us.

521
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,900
I'll meet you at home, honey.

522
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:01,800
I always knew you were on a short leash,
but not that you were on a choke collar.

523
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Nobody's in charge
in my house except me.

524
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,800
That's the way to talk, Gustafson!

525
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,600
I'm going home to get this matter
straightened out.

526
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,000
You're the man of the house, the king.

527
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,000
Max, top her off?

528
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,200
Long live the king!

529
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,300
She threw me out.

530
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:25,200
-Come on, just for tonight.
-Forget it.

531
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,700
You won't know I'm here!

532
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,900
Because you won't be!

533
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,100
What?

534
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,400
I'm cold!

535
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,600
Here's some matches!
Set yourself on fire!

536
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,700
You got 3 TV's on.
You're not looking at any of them!

537
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,200
What a pig.

538
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,500
That's my tuna on rye.
I've been looking all over for that.

539
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,800
Where was it?

540
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,400
Would you like half?

541
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,000
This milk has chunks in it.

542
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,600
What's your point?

543
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,900
What am I doing?

544
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,900
Next door...

545
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,600
...I've got a beautiful wife,
my own bed...

546
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,200
...and a refrigerator full of food
that hasn't expired.

547
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,200
What're you saying?

548
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:14,300
I'm going down to Ragetti's
to apologize!

549
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,600
You traitor! You Benedict Arnold!

550
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,500
Finally.

551
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,100
Didn't think he'd last this long.

552
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,700
Smells all right.

553
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,900
Why this change of heart?

554
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,700
I had a guilty conscience.

555
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,300
Ariel kicked me out of the house.

556
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,000
I knew I liked your wife.

557
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,700
What about Max?

558
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:50,000
Oh, my God, forget it. Max is much
too hardheaded to ever say he's sorry.

559
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,100
He's proud.

560
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,000
Of what?

561
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,400
I don't know. He has a strong
character, and I admire that.

562
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,700
You admire Max?

563
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,400
You really are from out of town.

564
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,200
Be careful. The grappa is very strong.

565
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,600
You are speaking to a Gustafson. I can
hold my liquor. And this stuff too.

566
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,400
How long you been married?

567
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,700
Six months next week. How about you?

568
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,000
I'm divorced.

569
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,200
I'm sorry.

570
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,800
Antonio was....

571
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,500
That sounds bad.

572
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,700
It ain't good.

573
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,900
Oh, jeez.

574
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,300
Enough of that.

575
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,100
I don't want to bore you.

576
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,200
Good night, Ariel.

577
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,400
Hey, Jacob. How are you?

578
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,400
Thanks for the Phillips.

579
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,000
Melanie and I wanted
to thank you and John--

580
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:39,000
We just wanted
you and John to know...

581
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,600
...how much we appreciate the help
you've given us with the wedding.

582
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
No need to thank me.

583
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,400
Yes, but--

584
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,700
Nothing would make us happier
than to see you tying the knot.

585
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,200
Thanks.

586
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:56,400
And it means a great deal to me
to be a part of it.

587
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,600
I'm proud of you.

588
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,600
Studying up on your Italian?

589
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,100
Thinking of wooing Maria?

590
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:09,500
No, I'm going to curse at her
in her own language, that's all.

591
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
I think she's a lesbian anyway.

592
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,900
You've never even seen a lesbian.

593
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:16,600
I did too! Saw them on "Geraldo"!

594
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,300
Whatever.
I think you got the hots for her.

595
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:23,900
Not in a million years.
She's just a pig-headed Italian witch...

596
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:26,700
...with piss and vinegar
running through her veins.

597
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,600
He's in love.

598
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,800
Where're you going?

599
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:55,200
Sven saw Catfish Hunter
at Indian Slough. Thought I'd go look.

600
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,200
Where's Tweedledum?

601
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:06,400
I don't know.

602
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,400
You don't know?
He didn't spend the night here?

603
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:14,000
No. Last night he said he was going
to Ragetti's to apologize to Maria.

604
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,600
You mean to tell me
he didn't come home?

605
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,400
He's alive.

606
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,300
-Take these, you'll feel better.
-What happened?

607
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
You passed out.

608
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,000
I thought you should stay.

609
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I feel like a polka band
is playing in my head.

610
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,600
You'll feel better after a hot shower.

611
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,900
But I don't really need a hot shower.

612
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,400
What if he had an accident?

613
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,200
The only accident he'll have
is when I see him.

614
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm sure there's
a logical explanation for all this.

615
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:03,500
It must be nice,
living in Never-Never Land.

616
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:08,000
Maybe I'll visit you sometime
when I need a break from reality.

617
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:12,400
Step on it.

618
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,100
He's going to explain everything...

619
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,600
...and I'll listen carefully...

620
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,800
...then I'll kill him.

621
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,500
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

622
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
All right, where is he?

623
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,700
-We know he's in here! Where is he?
-Don't deny it!

624
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,400
You don't understand.

625
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:49,000
I want to talk to him now!

626
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,100
Well, let me explain!

627
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,600
What? What's the matter with...?

628
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,100
-Nothing's going on.
-Where is John?

629
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,900
Wait a minute!

630
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,000
How could you?

631
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,800
This isn't what it looks like.

632
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,800
Gustafson, you're doing it again!

633
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,200
What do you mean?

634
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,100
First it was May! Then it was Ariel!

635
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,700
And now it's Maria!

636
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,600
Watch that damn thing.
You said you hated Maria.

637
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,200
That's not the point!

638
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,800
You're the one who said
I should apologize!

639
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:33,300
Apologize, yes! Not sleep with her!

640
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,600
There is a difference!

641
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:36,600
You think I had sex with him?

642
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,000
You sure weren't having sex with me!

643
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,500
Why should I have sex with you?
You said you hated me!

644
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:45,700
He said I hated you!
I never said I hated you!

645
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,600
Actually, I've grown quite fond of you!

646
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:53,200
So now I'm supposed
to have sex with you instead of him!

647
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,900
So you admit you slept with my husband!

648
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,800
Nobody slept with anybody!

649
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,400
Speak for yourself!

650
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,700
I had too much to drink last night.

651
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,800
Sure. Blame it on the booze.

652
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,700
You think that's an acceptable excuse
for what you did?

653
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:21,600
Will you let me finish?

654
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:27,600
I know my Maria. She don't want
nothing to do with that man.

655
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,800
How do you know?

656
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,400
Because!

657
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,800
She wants that man!

658
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,200
Me?

659
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,800
What do you want with me?

660
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,400
What does that mean?

661
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,700
"I'd rather kiss a dead moose's butt!"

662
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,800
So, I'll call you?

663
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,500
Three tiers like this!

664
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,200
The lemon cake with the white frosting
and the yellow flowers. You like?

665
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,600
-Perfect.
-Exactly what we wanted.

666
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,800
And now...

667
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,800
...for the big surprise.

668
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,900
What surprise?

669
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:24,200
We don't want surprises.

670
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,300
John thought of this by himself.

671
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,900
The groom goes here.

672
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:31,600
And the bride...

673
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,500
...goes on top, like this.

674
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,400
And then this goes here.

675
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,600
And then on top of the cake,
in the frosting...

676
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,000
...we spell out:

677
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,700
"Melanie has landed herself
another husband."

678
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,100
This is not good.

679
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,000
Maria

680
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,700
I just met a girl named Maria

681
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,100
And suddenly I see

682
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,300
She's not the bitch

683
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,600
I thought she'd be

684
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,500
Ox.

685
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,200
Nag.

686
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,500
I didn't know you were a fisherman.

687
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,800
There's a lot you don't know about me.

688
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,700
Any luck?

689
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,000
Holy moly!

690
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,000
I showed you mine,
now you show me yours.

691
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,000
You mean the fish.

692
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,700
It ain't the size that matters.

693
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,800
Are we still talking about your fish?

694
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,600
Very funny.

695
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:13,800
You know...

696
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,000
...I've lived here all my life.

697
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:20,800
Nobody knows about this place any more
than I do. I know everything.

698
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,600
I could take you around...

699
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,000
...if you would like it.

700
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,800
Are you asking me on a date?

701
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,600
Hell, no.

702
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,200
But if I were, and I'm not,
what would you say?

703
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,500
If I were to accept,
and I'm not saying I would....

704
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,300
Because I haven't asked you.

705
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,300
I would say....

706
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:44,500
What would you say?

707
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,200
Maybe.

708
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,800
Maybe? What kind of
an answer is "Maybe?"

709
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,800
Maybe's maybe.

710
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:56,000
Then maybe I'll stop by at 7:00 tonight.

711
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:59,300
Maybe I'll cook something nice
for you in the kitchen.

712
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:01,200
I'll see you then.

713
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:02,900
Maybe.

714
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,200
Whatever that means.

715
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,300
What do you think?

716
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:20,800
Wouldn't it make me look fat?

717
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,800
You should be so picky.
He's got the face of a mackerel!

718
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,300
Antonio had the face of an angel
and look where it got me.

719
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:32,000
How many times do you have to get
your heart broken?

720
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,200
Max is different, Mama.
He makes me laugh.

721
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,000
I don't like this. Not one bit.

722
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:41,000
But it's just a date.
I'm not marrying him.

723
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,400
Not yet.

724
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,000
"Not yet."

725
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,900
Sure you like the white better?

726
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:53,200
Definitely the blue.

727
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,600
I'm a little nervous.

728
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,300
Oh, come on.

729
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,400
Just be yourself. You'll be fine.

730
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:08,500
Why don't you pick up a bottle of wine
on the way? She'll appreciate it.

731
00:48:08,700 --> 00:48:09,800
Check.

732
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,300
And don't forget. Compliment her
on how great she looks.

733
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,200
-Already got that covered.
-Let me hear it.

734
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,000
There may be lots of fish in the sea...

735
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,700
...but you're the only one
I would like to mount over my fireplace.

736
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,600
That's not...bad.

737
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,500
You noticed the sexual innuendo?

738
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:37,900
I did.

739
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,200
Subliminal messages.

740
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,600
It's how you get people to do what
you want without them knowing it.

741
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,600
-Where'd you learn that?
-"Geraldo."

742
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:47,800
Oh, boy.

743
00:48:50,900 --> 00:48:52,500
Very nice.

744
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:57,400
I went to Nate's Auto Body Shop.
Had all the seats refinished.

745
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,900
It's authentic imitation leather.

746
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:05,600
Go get them, tiger.
You got nothing to worry about.

747
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,800
He's doomed.

748
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:51,200
There are many fish in the sea, Maria...

749
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,900
...but you're the only one I want
to mount over my fireplace.

750
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,900
You're the only one....

751
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,800
Holy moly.

752
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:14,400
Good evening, Maria.

753
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,000
Good evening.

754
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,000
You look nice.

755
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:19,800
Thank you.

756
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,000
I just want to say....

757
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,600
What I'm trying to say is....

758
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,200
There are many women
floating in the river...

759
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,300
...but you're the only one
I want to stuff...

760
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,000
...and stick over...

761
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,100
...on my wall over the fireplace.

762
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,400
Thank you so much.

763
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:44,900
Want to come in?

764
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,300
Please.

765
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:50,800
I didn't say it right.

766
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:57,300
I've never seen wine
that comes from a box before.

767
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,100
It's pretty fancy, huh?

768
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:01,500
Look, it's even got its own tap.

769
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,700
-It's real wine.
-That's great.

770
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:14,600
So, how do you like the old place?

771
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,900
It's changed.

772
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,600
Is that good or bad?

773
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,200
It's the worst.

774
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:22,600
I hate change.

775
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,600
Why?

776
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,200
Things never change for the better.

777
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,600
Change brought me here to Wabasha.

778
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:32,500
Are you saying you wish I hadn't come?

779
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
Is that a trick question?

780
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,200
You see?

781
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,200
Now the weather has changed!

782
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,300
So much for dining al fresco.

783
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,400
Holy moly.

784
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,000
I'm all wet.

785
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,900
It's really coming down now.

786
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,400
You know,
the night crawlers'll be out soon.

787
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,000
What's a night crawler?

788
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:06,400
Are you a communist?

789
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,000
Night crawler's the king of all worms.

790
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,900
They come out at night,
after the rain, to lay out on the grass.

791
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,500
Breathe the night air.

792
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,700
This restaurant is sitting on top of one
of the biggest and best worm beds...

793
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,000
...in Wabasha County!

794
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,000
You can imagine my excitement.

795
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:34,000
Honey, would you stop worrying?
Max is going to be just fine.

796
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,500
I hope so.

797
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:39,700
I may have given him
some bad advice earlier.

798
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,400
What'd you say?

799
00:52:42,700 --> 00:52:43,600
I told him....

800
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,900
I told him...

801
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,500
...to just be himself.

802
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,400
You said what?

803
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:54,500
Don't shine the light right on them.
They zip back into their holes.

804
00:52:54,700 --> 00:52:55,800
So I should....

805
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,000
Like this?

806
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:58,500
Up, down. Yeah.

807
00:52:58,700 --> 00:52:59,800
You know...

808
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,200
...that worms have both...

809
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:05,400
...male and female sexual organs?

810
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,800
-No, I didn't know that.
-Well, it's true.

811
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,400
You know a lot about worms, Max.

812
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,500
I don't know that much.

813
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,600
You do.

814
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,300
Every once in a while I pick up a tip.

815
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:18,800
That's it. That's good.

816
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:21,000
There's one.

817
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,200
There.

818
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,100
Quietly now.

819
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,400
-What should I do?
-Tiptoe over.

820
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,200
And then suddenly,
reach down and grab him.

821
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:34,800
When you get near him, grab him.

822
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,400
You all right, Maria?

823
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:46,600
You scared every worm away
for a radius of 5 miles.

824
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,200
I'm sorry.

825
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,900
What?

826
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,800
You have a very beautiful smile.

827
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,400
Would it be all right if I kissed you?

828
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,200
Yes.

829
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,700
I haven't been with a man
for a long time.

830
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,200
Me neither.

831
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,900
Be gentle.

832
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,000
Mamma mia.

833
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:42,800
Holy moly.

834
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:53,300


835
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,800


836
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,100
Morning, Mr. Gustafson.

837
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,500
I don't believe it.

838
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,600
You and that beautiful lady?

839
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,600
I am the thief of hearts.
I am the gangster of love.

840
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:40,100
Tell me, was it more of a holdup
than a stickup?

841
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:42,000
Never mind that.

842
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:46,600
Even your infantile penis jokes
seem charming and witty this morning.

843
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,200
Okay, Lothario, we got to get
to the Octoberfest to meet the kids.

844
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:58,200
I think I liked you better
before you were getting any.

845
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,200
-Hi, dear.
-Hi, dad.

846
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,000
What's going on?

847
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,500
We got a surprise.

848
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,200
No more surprises.

849
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,700
Attention!

850
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,000
In just 8 days...

851
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:36,000
...these two happy kids
will be husband and wife!

852
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,600
My dear friends...

853
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,000
...Max and John...

854
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,300
...have asked me...

855
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:47,600
...Handsome Hans...

856
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,300
...to be their music man!

857
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:58,000
Let's celebrate the young lovers'
nuptials with the Chicken Polka!

858
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,700
Come on, you're going to love this.

859
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:11,300
I'm in "The Twilight Zone."

860
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,600
Another one
of your father's great ideas.

861
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:18,000
Your father booked our reception hall!

862
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,600
Handsome Hans will fit
right in Slippery's bar!

863
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:22,200
It's a tavern.

864
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:26,600
It's a mistake.

865
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,200
Right. We'll get a DJ. This is crazy.

866
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,100
That's not what I meant.

867
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,600
I want to get married.
But if you're not sure, tell me.

868
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,400
I'm just not sure.

869
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,600
You tell me this now?

870
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,100
-Our wedding's in a week!
-Jacob, I love you.

871
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,800
-You just don't want to marry!
-That's not it!

872
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,100
I think we should take our time!

873
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:59,500
I've been taking my time! How does
waiting since the 2nd grade grab you?

874
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:01,300
Would you stop it!

875
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,600
It's like you are already married!

876
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:11,800
Polka!

877
00:58:18,100 --> 00:58:19,700
I know what I'm talking about.

878
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:23,200
Really? Then how come
you're the one that's divorced?

879
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:36,200
Honey?

880
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:38,800
-The wedding's off.
-What do you mean?

881
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,200
We already paid for everything!

882
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,500
Honey? What happened?

883
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,800
What happened? I'll tell you.

884
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,700
Your daughter got cold feet.

885
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:53,200
My ass! Your son insulted her.

886
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:56,700
Everything he said was true.
Maybe she can't handle the truth!

887
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,900
She can't? What is the truth, Max?

888
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,400
Her first marriage was a flop.

889
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:03,400
You know that was Mike's fault!

890
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,400
She couldn't keep Mike happy.
How can she keep Jacob happy?

891
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,600
That's a lousy thing....

892
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,600
My daughter wouldn't marry your son
if he was the last man in Wabasha.

893
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:15,800
Fine with me. I was against
the whole thing from the start.

894
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:17,200
That goes double for me.

895
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,200
It's off!

896
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,800
Yes, everything is off!

897
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,300
The wedding is off
and the friendship is off!

898
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,800
And the gloves are off.

899
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,500
Let the games begin.

900
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,300
Come on, baby!

901
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,800
Come to Papa!

902
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,200
Yes! That a boy!

903
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,200
That's it!

904
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:59,700
Oh, damn you, Goldman!

905
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:11,700
What a putz!

906
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,600
Here's your card.

907
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,800
-That's it for you?
-That'll do it.

908
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:34,000
-Have a nice day, Mr. Gustafson.
-Thanks. Same to you.

909
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,400
You dance very well.

910
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:19,800
Thank you.

911
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:25,100
I got this for you.
Hope you don't mind.

912
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:31,300
It's a cubic zirconia.

913
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,100
Got it from the Home Shopping Network.

914
01:01:34,300 --> 01:01:36,200
It's so beautiful.

915
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:37,800
Let me help you.

916
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:42,400
See how it looks.
Just put that like that.

917
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,000
You don't like it?

918
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:49,400
No, it's beautiful. It's just....

919
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:50,700
Just what?

920
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,600
I don't know.

921
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,700
Things are moving so fast.

922
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,600
What's wrong with fast?

923
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:57,500
I like fast.

924
01:01:57,700 --> 01:02:01,500
I didn't plan on meeting somebody
like you when I came to Wabasha.

925
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,700
But you're happy, huh?

926
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:07,700
Yes, but that is what worries me.

927
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:08,700
What do you mean?

928
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,200
I don't know what I'm talking about.

929
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,500
It's beautiful.

930
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:16,000
Thank you.

931
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,800
Thank you, Max.

932
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:35,200
Okay, Slick, sharpen those claws.

933
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:03,000
Get out of there!

934
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:11,300
Holy moly.

935
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,300
You just...

936
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,600
...kissed your ninth life
good-bye, Slick!

937
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,100
This one is very sweet.

938
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:25,300
That one, with the big tongue
and brown eyes, is great.

939
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,400
This one?

940
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,000
-This one?
-Yes. One eye.

941
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:31,400
No nuts.

942
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,800
You mean Lucky. You don't want him.

943
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:36,200
I'll take him.

944
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:37,700
Here, Lucky.

945
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:42,300
He's cute.

946
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,700
Good morning, Slick.

947
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:52,500
What a nice kitty-cat.

948
01:03:52,700 --> 01:03:54,000
Yes, you are.

949
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:58,100
And I see you've crapped
on my newspaper again.

950
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,600
Would you like to make
a new friend this morning?

951
01:04:02,800 --> 01:04:03,600
Lucky!

952
01:04:03,800 --> 01:04:04,600
Kill Slick!

953
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:08,500
Kill Slick!

954
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,800
Everything's under control.

955
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:04,700
How do you like that, you putz?

956
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:06,500
Why you dirty...!

957
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:11,200
I'll kill you!

958
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,600
You ruined my refinished seats!

959
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,300
You broadcast my naked ass
to half of Wabasha!

960
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,000
Big deal! Take that, you vandal!

961
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:21,500
You nearly killed my cat!

962
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:25,300
That mangy animal's been crapping
on my paper for years!

963
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,000
Give me that pole!

964
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:31,400
That pole, huh?!

965
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:40,800
That's it.

966
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,500
If my dog was as ugly as you...

967
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:46,800
...I'd shave his ass
and teach him to walk backwards!

968
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:52,200
That trick doesn't work.

969
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,800
Time out. Where are you going?

970
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:58,700
Home. You can call me
when this stupid war is over!

971
01:05:59,300 --> 01:06:00,700
She left me.

972
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:03,000
Are you surprised?

973
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,000
There we are.

974
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,400
So good.

975
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,600
Now...

976
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,200
...you want to put in...

977
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,200
...just a pinch of salt.

978
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,200
Damn it.

979
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:21,400
Not too much.

980
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,400
Yeah, now you tell me!

981
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:24,900
Not too salty.

982
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,000
Shut up.

983
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,400
There we are. Add some garnish here.

984
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:30,800
Time to check the birds.

985
01:06:30,900 --> 01:06:32,400
The bird.

986
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,300
Fire!

987
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,300
Fire!

988
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,000
I got a fire here!

989
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,700
Absolutely perfect.
Anybody can make these. It's simple.

990
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,100
What are you doing?

991
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:51,300
I'm trying to cook a gourmet dinner...

992
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,200
...for Maria.

993
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,200
-Look at this.
-She'll be impressed.

994
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:01,200
Tell her it's Cajun.

995
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,300
And what do you call this?

996
01:07:04,500 --> 01:07:05,600
Haven't decided.

997
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,200
But I'm leaning toward "Mystery Stew."

998
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:10,200
Is that right?

999
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,000
Maybe you need a backup plan.

1000
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:14,900
What else can you make?

1001
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:17,100
-Jelly sandwiches.
-Get cracking.

1002
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:20,000
I used to love jelly sandwiches
with peanut butter.

1003
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,200
So did you, when you were a kid.

1004
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:28,100
Go over and tell her you're sorry.

1005
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:32,100
I tried to. She won't even talk to me.
Not that I blame her.

1006
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:41,100
You spend too much time
with this Max Goldman.

1007
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,500
I like him, mamma. A lot.

1008
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,800
He'll break your heart, like the others.

1009
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,300
No, this time it's different.

1010
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:51,700
You said Fernando was different,
and look what happened.

1011
01:07:51,900 --> 01:07:53,500
I was a girl, mamma!

1012
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,800
And then there was Eduardo, the drunk.

1013
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,800
That was a long time ago.

1014
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,800
Marcello, the womanizer,
was not that long ago.

1015
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,300
I'm not listening.

1016
01:08:03,500 --> 01:08:06,000
And next came Carlo, the con man.

1017
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:07,600
-Are you finished?
-I wish!

1018
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,300
But then I would be forgetting Antonio!

1019
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,200
All five I warn you against...

1020
01:08:14,400 --> 01:08:17,600
...and all five you marry!

1021
01:08:18,200 --> 01:08:19,800
You are a good girl...

1022
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:22,000
...but you are cursed in love.

1023
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:23,200
That isn't true.

1024
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,600
For once, Maria, listen to your mama.

1025
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,000
Do you care for him?

1026
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,000
Yes.

1027
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,800
Then leave him be.

1028
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,800
There's a smile on my face

1029
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,900
For the whole human race

1030
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:05,000
Almost like being in love

1031
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,900
I've really done it this time.
I've really screwed it up.

1032
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,500
Jake and Melanie called it off.

1033
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:04,300
Jake's moved in with Max,
Max and I are at it again and...

1034
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:09,200
...Ariel's moved back into her house
with Melanie. What am I going to do?

1035
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:40,900
Looks like God remembered you, Pop.

1036
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,600
I'm sorry.

1037
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,800
Hey, moron.

1038
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,300
Hello, putz.

1039
01:12:19,900 --> 01:12:21,400
Mind if I join you?

1040
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:23,100
No, help yourself.

1041
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:29,000
I knew your old man longer
than I knew my own.

1042
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,600
He was always fond of you.

1043
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,200
He was a good man.

1044
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:35,500
The best.

1045
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:39,900
You know I didn't mean
what I said about Melanie.

1046
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,400
You know how I really feel about Jacob.

1047
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,200
He's a good boy.

1048
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,900
I just don't want him to be Ionely.

1049
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,600
He deserves better.

1050
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:52,200
He deserves Melanie.

1051
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,500
What do you want to do now?

1052
01:13:02,700 --> 01:13:03,800
Want to get drunk?

1053
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
Yeah.

1054
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:23,500
Come on, Grandpa John, hurry.

1055
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:27,200
I'm coming. But you already
got enough candy in this bag...

1056
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,200
...to give the neighborhood cavities.

1057
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:33,100
What will you do to ensure that
6 months from now you feel happier...

1058
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:35,700
...and more loved than you do today?

1059
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:38,600
The truth is,
if you don't do something...

1060
01:13:38,900 --> 01:13:40,500
...nothing in life will change.

1061
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:51,300
Stop the insanity!

1062
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:19,000
What are you feeding him?

1063
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:20,800
Hormel chili.

1064
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,500
He likes it.

1065
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,500
Trick or treat.

1066
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,900
Yeah, trick or treat.

1067
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,000
I forgot.
Just plain forgot.

1068
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:34,500
Hiya, kids.

1069
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:35,600
Here's your coaster.

1070
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:37,300
And a stapler for you.

1071
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,800
Open your bag. That's it. Good shot.

1072
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,200
Happy Halloween.

1073
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:43,400
Hi, Uncle Max.

1074
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:44,500
Who's that?

1075
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:48,200
-Hello, Allie.
-Is Allie here? Look at you.

1076
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:51,000
Let me hear a polar bear growl.

1077
01:14:53,900 --> 01:14:56,000
Happy Halloween there, putzo.

1078
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:57,900
How'd you know it's me?

1079
01:14:58,200 --> 01:15:02,000
You wear the same costume
every Christmas or whatever this--

1080
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,400
Halloween.

1081
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:07,900
Hey, you. How's your mom doing?

1082
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,300
Okay. Want to come over?

1083
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,100
Yeah, you want to go over
and just say hi?

1084
01:15:13,400 --> 01:15:16,300
She'd probably throw me out
the moment she saw me.

1085
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,200
Max, I think I got an idea.

1086
01:15:29,200 --> 01:15:30,400
Trick or treat!

1087
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,900
Hey, you!

1088
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:35,400
How did we do tonight?

1089
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,800
Uncle Max gave me a can opener
and a bunch of detergent.

1090
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:40,700
He did?

1091
01:15:42,500 --> 01:15:43,500
Yes, he did.

1092
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:49,000
I'm going to bed!

1093
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,800
Don't you want to watch
the scary movie?

1094
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,800
I said, I'm going to bed!

1095
01:15:55,900 --> 01:15:58,000
What has gotten into her?

1096
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:05,000
You look great.

1097
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,600
You look ridiculous.

1098
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,400
I needed to see you again...

1099
01:16:21,700 --> 01:16:24,600
...to tell you how sorry I was
for the way I acted.

1100
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:27,800
I just thought I couldn't be happy
unless we were married...

1101
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,900
...and I realize now...

1102
01:16:31,800 --> 01:16:34,200
...I just want you in my life.

1103
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:36,600
That's all I want.

1104
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:40,000
And if we ever do get married...

1105
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,600
...I promise...

1106
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,300
...we'll use a professional
wedding coordinator.

1107
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:52,600
You look terrific.

1108
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,400
They're watching us.

1109
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,800
No, they're not.

1110
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,800
No, they're not.
Yes, they are.

1111
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,800
Let's celebrate. Beers are on me.

1112
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:22,800
I'd love to, but I've got someone
very special waiting for me over there.

1113
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:28,000
If you had half a brain,
you could have the same thing.

1114
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,900
She dumped me!

1115
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:34,800
Would you park
that stupid pride of yours just once?

1116
01:17:35,900 --> 01:17:38,300
You might surprise yourself.

1117
01:17:48,100 --> 01:17:49,300
I must speak to Maria!

1118
01:17:53,100 --> 01:17:54,600
Put down that bat.

1119
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:56,100
She don't want to see you!

1120
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:59,000
I ain't leaving here until I see Maria!

1121
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:00,800
At last...

1122
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,800
...I get to whack him!

1123
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,200
Mamma, please. Please.

1124
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:12,000
Maria, we need to talk.

1125
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,700
There's nothing to talk about.

1126
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:19,200
At least give me an explanation.
I think I deserve that much.

1127
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:21,800
Yes, you're right.

1128
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:25,400
I must tell you something.

1129
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,600
I have been married before.

1130
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,400
To Antonio, I know.

1131
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,900
But also to Fernando.

1132
01:18:36,100 --> 01:18:37,000
And Carlo.

1133
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,700
And Eduardo.

1134
01:18:40,900 --> 01:18:42,700
And Marcello.

1135
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,000
Holy moly.

1136
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,600
You've been married 5 times?

1137
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:56,100
So, now you understand?

1138
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:58,400
Mother is right.

1139
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,400
I'm cursed in love.

1140
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,400
Wait! Wait!

1141
01:19:07,700 --> 01:19:09,700
Will you wait, please?

1142
01:19:13,600 --> 01:19:16,400
I don't know what happened
with those other guys, but...

1143
01:19:16,700 --> 01:19:18,800
...let me tell you something about me.

1144
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:26,000
I know I'm no great prize,
but I'm loyal...

1145
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:27,800
...I'm honest...

1146
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,600
...and I know how to treat a lady.

1147
01:19:32,600 --> 01:19:36,000
Anybody who says different
doesn't know her ass from her elbow.

1148
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,800
Look, I got a week's worth
of leftovers at the house...

1149
01:19:44,100 --> 01:19:48,700
...so if you care to join me for some
Mystery Stew and jelly sandwiches...

1150
01:19:48,900 --> 01:19:51,200
...I would be indeed honored.

1151
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:55,800
That sounds wonderful.

1152
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,700
You must really like jelly sandwiches.

1153
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:23,800
Trés magnifique, Max.

1154
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,400
Thank you.

1155
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,300
We're running a little behind.

1156
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:28,800
Meet you at church.

1157
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,600
Don't be late!

1158
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,800
Isn't that Sven over there?

1159
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,600
What's the matter?
You saw a ghost?

1160
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:04,400
Biggest fish I ever seen.

1161
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:06,400
Catfish Hunter, yeah.

1162
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:10,400
I fought the beast...

1163
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:11,700
...for an hour...

1164
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,300
...and I had him.

1165
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:16,400
Right up into the boat.
And then...

1166
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,100
...he smiled.

1167
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:20,600
-Smiled?
-See?

1168
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:22,000
Bit the pole in half.

1169
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,600
Holy moly.

1170
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:26,800
I moved my hand at the last moment.

1171
01:21:27,000 --> 01:21:28,000
Judas Priest.

1172
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,600
That was the...

1173
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,600
...biggest damn fish that...

1174
01:21:34,900 --> 01:21:36,200
...I ever saw.

1175
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,500
Don't even think of it.

1176
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:46,000
My boat is beached not more
than 100 yards from here.

1177
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:50,300
We'll give it 10 minutes. After that,
we pull anchor, go to the church.

1178
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,700
What if today is the day,
and we miss him?

1179
01:21:53,900 --> 01:21:55,400
Someone else could catch him!

1180
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,800
Some stranger with our fish
mounted on his wall.

1181
01:21:59,500 --> 01:22:02,000
It's too horrible to think about.

1182
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,400
Let's go.

1183
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,000
What do you mean?
We still have time.

1184
01:22:30,300 --> 01:22:33,200
That fish'll be halfway
to Redwing by now. Let's go.

1185
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:34,300
5 more minutes.

1186
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:35,400
We'll be late!

1187
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,500
Weddings never start on time!
What's the matter? Why are you worried?

1188
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:44,800
I'm going.

1189
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:49,300
You'll have to swim back. Where are
you going? Don't touch my motor!

1190
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:53,200
Sit down, John, for crying out loud!

1191
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:54,700
5 more minutes!

1192
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:56,600
Just sit there and shut up.

1193
01:22:56,800 --> 01:22:58,400
-Moron.
-Putz.

1194
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,300
Holy Jesus, Max.

1195
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,600
Look, look.

1196
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,200
Easy, easy!

1197
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,100
Don't worry.

1198
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:23,100
Look at him go.

1199
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:26,500
Now he will stop.

1200
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:29,800
And now I'm going to....

1201
01:23:33,000 --> 01:23:34,400
That's Catfish Hunter.

1202
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,000
I think I pissed him off!

1203
01:23:39,200 --> 01:23:42,300
Hang on, Max,
I think we're going for a ride.

1204
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:54,700
Hang on.

1205
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,800
I can't believe it's a fish.

1206
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,700
Maybe it's not a fish!

1207
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,400
Maybe it's something from outer space!

1208
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,100
Keep the tip up!

1209
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,300
-The tip is up.
-Tighten the drag!

1210
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,800
He better be dead.
That's the only excuse I'm taking.

1211
01:24:10,100 --> 01:24:12,700
-Work him!
-I'm working him, dummy!

1212
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:15,300
Pump him, pump him! Tip up!

1213
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:17,200
The tip is up, you idiot!

1214
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:21,400
You're right, it's not an important day.
No reason to be here.

1215
01:24:21,700 --> 01:24:22,700
Hang on.

1216
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:27,500
Drop the anchor.

1217
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,100
You cut the anchor, putz!

1218
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:30,700
Then grab the net.

1219
01:24:30,900 --> 01:24:34,100
You cut the net, too, you dickhead!
Here! Look!

1220
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:37,000
Forget the net!
Just give me a hand, will you?

1221
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,600
The only thing you ever caught
in your life was a virus.

1222
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:42,600
Put your gloves on.

1223
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:46,300
I'll show you how to do it.
Here's the way you do it.

1224
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:47,700
Now, watch.

1225
01:24:49,500 --> 01:24:50,600
Grab him!

1226
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,600
Crime in Italy.

1227
01:24:57,600 --> 01:24:59,300
Holy moly! My God!

1228
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,900
Look at this thing.

1229
01:25:01,100 --> 01:25:02,700
Holy moly!

1230
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,400
Get his tail.

1231
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,700
I got his tail!

1232
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,000
Now!

1233
01:25:22,100 --> 01:25:25,300
Is that the most beautiful thing
you've ever seen?

1234
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,400
If I die today...

1235
01:25:27,800 --> 01:25:29,700
...I die a happy man.

1236
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,100
If you die today, I'll take your motor.

1237
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:44,300
Let's let him go.

1238
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:46,900
Are you out of your mind?

1239
01:25:47,100 --> 01:25:50,000
Dad tried to catch that fish
for 20 years.

1240
01:25:50,200 --> 01:25:52,800
Catfish Hunter deserves
to be in the lake with Pop.

1241
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,900
Gustafson, you are one sick bastard.

1242
01:26:00,200 --> 01:26:01,100
Good boy.

1243
01:26:06,400 --> 01:26:08,300
Good-bye, Catfish!

1244
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:25,400
The wedding! What time is it?

1245
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,500
We got another wedding at 3:00.

1246
01:26:32,700 --> 01:26:35,000
We'll make it by then. 3:00!

1247
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,400
Get me to the church on time.

1248
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:41,600
Don't sing that.

1249
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,800
Move it!

1250
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,100
What are you doing?

1251
01:26:53,900 --> 01:26:55,700
Okay, just a little bit longer.

1252
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:58,000
-Just a bit longer.
-I'm done.

1253
01:26:58,100 --> 01:27:00,600
I've played, now.
How long have I played?

1254
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,000
-See my hands?
-Just keep playing.

1255
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,200
I'll play one more time.

1256
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,200
Wedding!

1257
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:39,500
-We're here!
-Wait!

1258
01:27:39,700 --> 01:27:40,400
Wait!

1259
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:45,900
Wait, we're here!

1260
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,200
We're here!

1261
01:27:47,700 --> 01:27:48,900
Why the boots?

1262
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,300
I'll explain later.

1263
01:27:50,500 --> 01:27:53,800
Explain now. Where have you been?
I've held this up for hours!

1264
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:13,000
See what we missed?

1265
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:14,700
Thank God we eloped.

1266
01:28:41,700 --> 01:28:43,000
You got the ring?

1267
01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:07,900
My son-in-law
has got the face of a mackerel.

1268
01:29:11,200 --> 01:29:12,500
Ox.

1269
01:29:12,700 --> 01:29:13,800
Nag.

1270
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:16,200
We are gathered here today...

1271
01:29:16,300 --> 01:29:18,200
...to join Maxwell Goldman...

1272
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,800
...and Maria Sofia Colletta Ragetti...

1273
01:29:20,900 --> 01:29:22,300
...in holy matrimony.

1274
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:40,300
Be sure to watch Lucky for us.

1275
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:42,800
I'll miss that ugly mug of his.

1276
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,500
Don't worry, you'll see him
before you know it.

1277
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,300
I'll miss your ugly mug, too.

1278
01:29:47,500 --> 01:29:49,300
God bless you, sir.

1279
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:51,200
Let go of my hand. I'm busy.

1280
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,200
What's that smell?

1281
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:24,000
What smell?

1282
01:30:35,900 --> 01:30:37,600
What a moron.

1283
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,700
What do you say
we go back to my place...

1284
01:30:53,900 --> 01:30:58,200
...and I'll show you my spicy,
peppy pepperoni?

1285
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,200
What do you say
we go back to my house...

1286
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:06,400
...and I'll show you
my man-sized manicotti?

1287
01:31:07,400 --> 01:31:08,400
Beautiful.

1288
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,000
I'm the gangster of love.

1289
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:13,600
I am the Lothario of farts.

1290
01:31:14,100 --> 01:31:15,600
I don't know where I am.

1291
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:17,500
Get in the car, Max.

1292
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:21,100
I can't. I farted
and I'm afraid to move.

1293
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,800
What the hell is her name?

1294
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,000
Ariel?

1295
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:27,700
What's her name again?

1296
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,100
Maria.

1297
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:30,800
She left me.

1298
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,000
You're surprised?

1299
01:31:32,100 --> 01:31:34,000
You don't even know her name.

1300
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,600
Hey, dickhead!

1301
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:39,600
I'm stuck.

1302
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,200
I've been to Hawaii.

1303
01:31:43,400 --> 01:31:44,600
Which island?

1304
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,600
l-kinda-like-to-poke-you.

1305
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:48,400
You-like-a-licky-dicky.

1306
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:50,300
I'm-a-kinda-kinky.

1307
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:51,800
Want-a-peek-a-pee-pee?

1308
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,900
Some stranger could catch our fish.

1309
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:57,600
Some schmuck with his fish...

1310
01:31:57,800 --> 01:31:59,500
...and my fish and your fish

1311
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:01,100
up on the ******* wall.

1312
01:32:01,700 --> 01:32:03,800
I am so horrible!

1313
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,100
Get another actor. Please.

1314
01:32:08,300 --> 01:32:09,200
She's nothing but...

1315
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:11,000
a pig-headed Italian with....

1316
01:32:13,200 --> 01:32:15,900
Go one more from the top,
and a little more out of breath.

1317
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:18,300
If I was more out of breath,
I'd be dead.

1318
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,900
You're still a putz.

1319
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:21,000
That's my line!

1320
01:32:21,300 --> 01:32:24,000
You will never even know it's there.

1321
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,200
I love you.

1322
01:32:32,600 --> 01:32:34,000
He's a criminal!

1323
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:39,200
Should the veil be up?

1324
01:32:43,700 --> 01:32:44,400
Ox!

1325
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:46,200
Jesus Christ!

1326
01:32:46,400 --> 01:32:49,200
Why the **** don't you look
where you're going?

1327
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:51,600
Why don't you come to my place?

1328
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:54,800
I'll show you my beefy bologna.

1329
01:32:56,700 --> 01:32:59,800
How would you like my bony macaroni?

1330
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,400
Or my fatty Alfredo?

1331
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:04,500
Or my hard salami?

1332
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:06,300
I got them all.

1333
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:16,900
