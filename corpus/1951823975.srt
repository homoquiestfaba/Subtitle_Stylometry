I'll have a word, boss.

517
00:51:12,080 --> 00:51:13,957
Annik? <i>Hola.</i>

518
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:26,071
Come on, then. Let's have it.

519
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,628
OK. [inhales]

520
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:38,076
OK, so, um...
Do you like the Buzzcocks?

521
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,312
They're a good laugh.

522
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,790
Yeah, they're all right,
apart from the "cocks" bit.

523
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,516
- There you go.
- [kisses]

524
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,831
What is the most beautiful thing
you've seen in your life?

525
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,030
I saw a beautiful drum kit down at
Johnny Roadhouse's shop once.

526
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,474
[Annik] What about music?
Is that beautiful?

527
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,631
Some of it.

528
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,357
What about Joy Division's music?

529
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:13,795
Some of it, yeah, but...

530
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,428
...some of it's
not meant to be beautiful.

531
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,917
Does anyone believe in love?

532
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:30,234
I believe in pure... sex.

533
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,516
[Hooky] I believe in feeling, yeah.

534
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:37,479
[Annik] What does that mean?

535
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,471
You know, like if I had a car,

536
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:44,279
and I felt love for the car
and somebody kicked my car.

537
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:47,671
I'd be as upset as if
they kicked my girlfriend.

538
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:50,437
[snickering]

539
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:57,155
So you're not a journalist, then?

540
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,788
It's a hobby thing, not a full-time job.

541
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:05,029
I work for the Belgian embassy,
for the chancellor.

542
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,711
Sounds interesting.

543
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,950
Free, independent woman.

544
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,111
I suppose so, yes.

545
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,790
Tell me about Macclesfield.

546
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,471
[sighs] It's grey, it's miserable.

547
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,790
I've wanted to escape it my whole life.

548
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,152
What about your wife?

549
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:46,357
She loves it in Macclesfield.

550
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,710
You were married so young.

551
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:59,153
I've never heard of people
marrying so young.

552
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,518
Yeah, I know.

553
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,709
My marriage was a mistake.

554
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:24,708
- Are you tired?
- Mmm-hmm.

555
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:35,437
[door opens and closes]

556
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,879
[door closes]

557
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:42,429
[Debbie cooing]

558
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,749
[kissing and moaning]
