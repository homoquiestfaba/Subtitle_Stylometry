At night, it's beautiful.

00:00:29,797 --> 00:00:34,568
It's the City of Angels because
you can't see the demons out

00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,369

Do you know what it's
like to be in hell?

7
00:00:41,275 --> 00:00:43,444
You have an illness.

8
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:46,280
Maybe it's more of an addiction.

and it makes you do things.

Why are these people here
in the middle of the night?

18
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:24,152
Arriving or leaving?

19
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,587
At least they have
a destination.

me about something

00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:44,697
Ah, I guess there wasn't nothin'
for me in these glad rags,

183
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:46,766
anyway.

184
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:50,103
WILLIAM BROHNER:
That special fix?

185
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:52,505
What happens if
you don't get it?

186
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,108
Nothing good.

187
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,011
It's not like this is
something that I woke up

188
00:12:58,111 --> 00:13:00,613
one morning and decided to do.

189
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:02,950
WILLIAM BROHNER: Isn't it?

190
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,417
How did it start?

191
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,687
I already told you that.

192
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,158
WILLIAM BROHNER: On
the record, please.

193
00:13:11,258 --> 00:13:13,526
Earlier this year-- May.

194
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,999
The 24th, to be exact.

195
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,436
WILLIAM BROHNER: Time of day?

196
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:29,542
Evening, night,
just after 10:00.

197
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,544
WILLIAM BROHNER: You
were attending a class.

198
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:36,249
Yes, a law class about
TRIPs-- trade-related

199
00:13:36,349 --> 00:13:39,186
intellectual property rights.

200
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,353
WILLIAM BROHNER:
And the professor?

201
00:13:40,453 --> 00:13:41,354
Not a professor.

202
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:42,155
The lecturer.

203
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:50,530
He asked me to stay after class
and discuss my proposed paper.

204
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:54,334
Do you have a minute, he said.

205
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:56,836
Now I've got all the
time in the world, time

206
00:13:56,937 --> 00:14:02,275
to wander, wait for it to
catch up to me, maybe kill me.

207
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:04,577
WILLIAM BROHNER: Earlier
you asked me if I knew

208
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,413
what it was like to be in hell.

209
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,615
ROWENA: Do you know what
it's like every waking

210
00:14:08,715 --> 00:14:12,785
moment confused and pained?

211
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:16,089
You glide through your world
thinking it must be a dream.

212
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:18,858
Can't possibly be real.

213
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,794
Where you are cannot be real
because what you're doing,

214
00:14:21,895 --> 00:14:24,397
people only do in nightmares.

215
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,967
Except you can't wake up.

216
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:28,501
And then you do.

217
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,438
And you're inside the nightmare.

218
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,874
You tell yourself that what
drives you to the unspeakable,

219
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,109
that's not you.

220
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,478
Not really.

221
00:14:38,578 --> 00:14:39,279
You lie to yourself.

222
00:14:42,249 --> 00:14:45,118
WILLIAM BROHNER: Being a little
melodramatic, aren't you?

223
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,154
Am I?

224
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:49,822
Maybe you just don't get it.

225
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:52,926
WILLIAM BROHNER: I get that you
feel afflicted by something.

226
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,894
What is that feeling?

227
00:14:54,995 --> 00:14:56,729
ROWENA: Phosphor
and sharp sparks

228
00:14:56,829 --> 00:15:00,167
without one cooling tear.

229
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,203
Like the Lamia, not
inappropriately.

230
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,173
[music playing]

231
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,612
[background chatter]

232
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,021
[announcement over loudspeaker]

[engine starting]

235
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:13,606
Wasn't I clear?

236
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:20,213
You were.

237
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,183
Maybe I want to party.

238
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:23,983
No, you don't.

239
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:30,690
Not wearing your party clothes.

240
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,559
OK.

241
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:38,331
I thought that since we
seemed to be kindred beings,

242
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,468
you might be able to
answer a few questions.

243
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:42,402
Why not?

244
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,837
What's your name, anyway?

245
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:45,638
Travis.

246
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,676
What were you expecting?

247
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:53,880
I don't know.

248
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,850
Just not something
country and western.

249
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,652
Maybe something more exotic.

250
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,453
Transylvanian?

251
00:17:03,556 --> 00:17:05,458
You've seen too many movies.

252
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:08,528
Well, like you
said, I'm new at this.

253
00:17:08,628 --> 00:17:10,297
And you are?

254
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:12,865
Rowena.

255
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:13,833
All right, Rowena.

256
00:17:17,104 --> 00:17:19,072
What?

257
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,074
It's not going to
give me cancer.

258
00:17:21,174 --> 00:17:23,276
I'm allergic.

259
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:24,744
No, you're not.

260
00:17:24,844 --> 00:17:26,413
No allergies.

261
00:17:26,513 --> 00:17:27,780
No ailments.

262
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,815
Not anymore.

263
00:17:28,915 --> 00:17:33,686
So I can't get sick
or even feel bad?

264
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:42,929
So if I say this sucks,
it's emotional only.

265
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:46,366
There are some
physical sensitivities.

266
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:47,500
So let's get out of the sun.

267
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,773
It's not like I work
off of some checklist.

268
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:56,042
I just try to follow the rules.

269
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:57,444
WILLIAM BROHNER: Rules?

270
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,246
A right way and a wrong way.

271
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:00,280
Rules.

272
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,714
WILLIAM BROHNER: Who
made these rules?

273
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,515
I did.

274
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,784
Why are you being an idiot?

275
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,853
WILLIAM BROHNER: I'm just
trying to understand.

276
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,087
Why have rules?

277
00:18:08,188 --> 00:18:11,258
It's the only way
that I can stay human.

278
00:18:11,358 --> 00:18:13,960
After humanness is
lost, then comes

279
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:17,530
righteousness, and then rules.

280
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,866
WILLIAM BROHNER: What is
that, the Dao De Jing?

281
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:21,234
Look at you!

282
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:24,404
I guess you did
read a book once.

283
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:27,774
WILLIAM BROHNER: So now you want
to tie in Daoist philosophy?

284
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:29,108
No.

285
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:33,146
Christ, Buddha, Zoroastrian
monkeys-- none of that shit

286
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:36,783
has anything to do
with the work rules.

[music playing]

288
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,094
What are you looking at?

289
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,132
I've seen you by the park.

290
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:54,767
What are you doing here?

291
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:57,937
Selling Girl Scout cookies.

292
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:00,873
How about some Thin Mints?

293
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,942
Who's that?

294
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:03,743
Your mother?

295
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,750
You're putting your
own daughter out?

296
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,453
You sorry excuse.

297
00:19:13,553 --> 00:19:16,289
How about now?

298
00:19:16,389 --> 00:19:18,591
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

299
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:23,029
I've seen you, too,
skeezing in the park.

300
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,431
But you disrespect us?

301
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,134
And I've seen you at night.

302
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:33,340
What have you seen?

303
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,642
Nothing.

304
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:38,010
Just you and that jigahoo.

305
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,713
So step off, bitch.

[music playing]

307
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,024
WILLIAM BROHNER: So
what are you saying?

308
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:55,828
Life's hard for crack whores?

309
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,029
At least they're not smug.

310
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,435
WILLIAM BROHNER: And
how about your kind?

311
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,404
My kind?

312
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:07,907
You think you know my kind?

313
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,309
You don't.

ROWENA (VOICEOVER): There are
things that come out at night.

315
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,014
Things that can't exist
in the light of day.

316
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:19,319
But at night, they
can wander freely.

317
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,921
They have nothing to fear.

318
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:24,056
And you never know when you
might run into one of them.

belaboring the obvious.

00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:48,107
I'll just go buy you some
movie passes with this money.

Well, good thing,
because I only got one

00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:15,301
It's tangential.

seems important to you.

Eddie knows me for who I am.

00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:23,810
He saw.

That's how we met.

on the uptake, are you?

00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,353
Andrew only got a tiny peek.

363
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:35,722
That's all.

364
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:37,490
WILLIAM BROHNER: You can
mock me as much as you want,

365
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:41,594
but we're not really telling
me who or what you've become,

366
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:42,895
are you?

367
00:22:42,995 --> 00:22:44,664
Andrew asked me to do this.

368
00:22:44,764 --> 00:22:48,034
So let's just cut to the chase.

369
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:54,106
My typical day, my
normal day, my yesterday.

370
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,719
[honk]

371
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,655
What's your fucking problem?

372
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,957
You don't want to
know what my problem is.

373
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,125
It's a parking lot, not
a freeway, jerk-off.

374
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:13,926
You're right.

375
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:14,761
I don't want to know.

376
00:23:14,861 --> 00:23:15,562
So move.

377
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,730
What is your problem?

378
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,098
Are you too busy
thinking about what

379
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,668
schmuck you're going to sue next
to watch where you're going?

380
00:23:21,768 --> 00:23:23,536
Get out of the way!

381
00:23:23,636 --> 00:23:24,704
Or what?

382
00:23:24,804 --> 00:23:26,706
You're going to run me over?

383
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:29,108
That might get blood on
your pretty little car.

384
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,077
[engine noise]

385
00:23:36,516 --> 00:23:39,085
Are you out of your
mind, you stupid cunt?

386
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:42,088
[music playing]

387
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,091
Oh my god.

388
00:23:51,197 --> 00:23:53,299
Jesus Christ.

389
00:23:53,399 --> 00:23:55,267
What is wrong with you?

390
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,603
Who really knows?

391
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:59,939
Maybe I just hate people
with a sense of entitlement.

392
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:02,509
You're a crazy bitch.

393
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,977
[music playing]

394
00:24:08,047 --> 00:24:09,949
[engine noise]

395
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,155
OK?

396
00:24:16,255 --> 00:24:18,825
Real guy.

397
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,059
Go ahead.

398
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,360
Call him up.

399
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,830
WILLIAM BROHNER: I don't
think that you called him up.

400
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,297
You went to see him.

401
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:27,900
Yeah, I did.

402
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,870
ROWENA (VOICEOVER): I could
hardly wait to see him again.

403
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,472
Then, it doesn't always
play out the way you expect.

404
00:24:37,176 --> 00:24:39,879
Is anything ever
the way you expect?

405
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,882
[music playing]

406
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,687
[door closing quietly]

407
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:53,425
You could tell from where the
guy lived he never met a drug

408
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:56,863
dealer, car thief,
or everyday scumbag

409
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:58,631
whose money he didn't like.

410
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,000
So he took it.

411
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,671
And he used it to
buy things he didn't

412
00:25:04,771 --> 00:25:09,008
need just because he could.

413
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:12,011
[music playing]

414
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,457
Well, what do you think?

415
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,196
One more go-round.

416
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:32,699
Get some water
from the bathroom.

417
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,202
[music playing]

418
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,006
Whoa.

419
00:25:42,909 --> 00:25:44,677
Where did you come from?

420
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,746
What is this?

421
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:48,581
Girlfriend?

422
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:50,950
Looks more like
the hired help to me.

423
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,885
How'd you get in here?

424
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,186
The door was open.

425
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,856
Well, why don't you
close it on your way out?

426
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,592
Yeah, he's plum wore out.

427
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,861
Look, I can't have come
all this way for nothing.

428
00:26:01,961 --> 00:26:04,864
If I leave without any money,
it's [inaudible] for me.

429
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:07,266
Not our problem.

430
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:08,334
Oh, come on.

431
00:26:08,434 --> 00:26:10,002
You guys are just
all hot and bothered.

432
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:12,538
How much longer you going to
be messing with that trash?

433
00:26:12,639 --> 00:26:14,874
Ain't she something?

434
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:17,076
I told you, hit the road.

435
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:19,145
Or you're going to end
up where he's going.

436
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,783
And I said I can't leave
here without any money.

437
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:25,517
We don't pay for sex.

438
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:29,756
If we want to tap some
ass, [chuckles] we tap it.

439
00:26:29,856 --> 00:26:31,891
Then let me just
search his pockets, then.

440
00:26:31,991 --> 00:26:34,393
Hey, not so rough.

441
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,261
Yeah, all right.

442
00:26:35,361 --> 00:26:36,062
All right.

443
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:36,963
But not here.

444
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,932
[music playing]

445
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,751
Wake up.

446
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,186
Huh?

447
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:02,321
[groaning]

448
00:27:10,162 --> 00:27:12,331
You know--

449
00:27:12,431 --> 00:27:14,433
[grunting]

450
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:17,770
In the end, this
is what happens

451
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,972
when you piss off your clients.

452
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:23,209
ROWENA: I'll take that.

453
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:24,476
You surprised me.

454
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:25,277
Again.

455
00:27:28,347 --> 00:27:29,048
I don't like surprises.

456
00:27:32,118 --> 00:27:33,753
Where's Lenny?

457
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,554
Taking a nap.

458
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:36,856
He's plum wore out.

459
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,028
You should've left when
I gave you the chance.

460
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:43,329
[grunt] Ah!

461
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,799
[dramatic music playing]

462
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,207
[grunting]

463
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:56,843
[thud]

464
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,815
Who are you, sweetheart?

465
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:06,585
Just a girl trying to get by.

466
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,054
Nobody special.

467
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:08,955
You could've fooled me.

468
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:14,961
[gunshots]

469
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,430
[gunshots]

470
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,934
[music playing]

471
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,488
Hey!

472
00:28:42,588 --> 00:28:44,423
What the fuck are you doing?

473
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:47,359
[dramatic music playing]

474
00:28:57,770 --> 00:28:59,038
Know how I'm gonna hurt you?

475
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:02,975
[grunts]

476
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:04,143
Is that all you got, Lenny?

477
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,251
Last chance.

478
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,521
Leave now.

479
00:29:15,621 --> 00:29:17,523
[grunting]

480
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,693
[dramatic music playing]

481
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,099
I love that under
taste of fire.

482
00:29:33,072 --> 00:29:36,442
[groaning]

483
00:29:36,542 --> 00:29:39,211
[dramatic music playing]

484
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,995
[groaning]

485
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,269
Please stay away.

486
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:04,403
Don't touch me.

487
00:30:04,503 --> 00:30:05,771
Would you just shut up?

488
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:07,706
No-- no, I'm sorry about what
happened in the parking lot.

489
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:08,507
Please don't kill me.

490
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:09,708
I swear I'll do anything.

491
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:10,542
OK.

492
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,278
Stop whining like a little girl.

493
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:15,547
I'm not going to kill you.

494
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,084
How did you find me?

495
00:30:18,184 --> 00:30:20,452
You dropped your
business card.

496
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:24,190
So if you're not, then
why did you come here?

497
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:29,161
I actually came here to kill
you, but I changed my mind.

498
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,496
So chill.

499
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:33,132
I'm not doing it.

500
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:35,767
Look, you can take it from me.

501
00:30:35,868 --> 00:30:38,637
There are worse things
than being dead.

502
00:30:38,737 --> 00:30:44,210
[stammering] You
would kill me for that?

503
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:46,745
Well, it was good
enough for them.

504
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,115
Dead is dead, dude.

505
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,683
Usually.

506
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:52,718
I was wrong.

507
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:54,386
You were kind of a prick.

508
00:30:54,486 --> 00:30:57,189
But I was out of line, too.

509
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,060
Sorry.

510
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,994
Oh.

511
00:31:02,094 --> 00:31:03,395
Huh.

512
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,432
I mean, weird as it may be,
if I hadn't come to kill you,

513
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:08,200
you'd be dead.

514
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:20,312
So what you did-- I mean,
are-- are you a-- are you--

515
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:23,315
What do I look
like, the tooth fairy?

516
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:26,452
So what happens now?

517
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,654
Well, after I
take care of Tex,

518
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:30,722
you can finish the cleanup.

519
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,059
Yeah.

520
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:37,196
And if I ever need a
lawyer, you come running.

521
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,268
Absolutely.

522
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,505
You're not buying this.

523
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:47,606
WILLIAM BROHNER:
You must realize

524
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,808
it's a little hard to swallow.

525
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,843
Believe it or not.

526
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:53,312
Whatever.

527
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:54,780
[footsteps]

528
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,715
[music playing]

529
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,650
[sirens]

530
00:32:06,058 --> 00:32:08,360
Is there a problem, ladies?

531
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,829
Yeah, there is.

532
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,701
Well, are you with
those bad boys upstairs?

533
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:17,036
What boys?

534
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:18,837
We're with ourselves.

535
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,706
I see.

536
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:24,043
Well, OK then.

537
00:32:24,143 --> 00:32:26,012
This is our turf, see?

538
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,280
Our agent wants you
to get that message.

539
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:32,784
I was just here
visiting my lawyer.

540
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,421
I had a dispute that
needed to be handled.

541
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,156
So now you've got
a dispute with us.

542
00:32:37,256 --> 00:32:39,992
Now that I understand
it's your turf,

543
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:41,460
the next time I
go see my lawyer,

544
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,662
I'll make sure to
dress more demurely.

545
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,131
Isn't that enough?

546
00:32:45,231 --> 00:32:46,632
Can I go now?

547
00:32:46,732 --> 00:32:48,167
All you've got is talk.

548
00:32:48,267 --> 00:32:52,138
Why don't you just
go tell your agent

549
00:32:52,238 --> 00:32:57,176
or whatever that I understand.

550
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,310
We're all good.

551
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,912
He said make sure
she don't forget.

552
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,117
Bad idea.

553
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,386
You know what's a bad idea?

554
00:33:07,486 --> 00:33:10,689
You coming around like
that is a bad idea.

555
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:11,623
I just gotta make a point.

556
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:13,259
I just gotta cut you a little.

557
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,095
Jesus, does everybody in this
town have a freaking knife?

558
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:16,928
No.

559
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,297
Some of us got guns.

560
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:20,899
And maybe you should
just put that shit away,

561
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,103
step aside before I get mad.

562
00:33:24,203 --> 00:33:26,372
Ooh, serious.

563
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,740
Ah!

564
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,110
Let me go, you bitch!

565
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:33,045
Call me that
again, and I'll rip

566
00:33:33,145 --> 00:33:35,414
your fucking vocal chords out.

567
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,415
Look.

568
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,384
I'm going to walk away now.

569
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:39,385
Don't follow me.

570
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:43,355
No!

571
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,893
WILLIAM BROHNER:
So that's the rule.

572
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:50,229
You only kill killers.

573
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,798
Are all your fantasies
this involved?

574
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,401
You're more
judgmental than Marty.

575
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,368
[door closing]

576
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:59,371
[footsteps]

577
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,785
[grunts]

578
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:15,254
[zipper]

579
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:25,197
[television noise]

580
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:53,024
[beep]

581
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,498
[beeping]

582
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:02,468
[television noise]

583
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:17,216
So where you been?

584
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:23,222
Out.

585
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,091
Care to elaborate
on that a bit?

586
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,293
What for?

587
00:35:27,393 --> 00:35:30,061
Out works for me.

588
00:35:30,162 --> 00:35:31,297
What?

589
00:35:31,397 --> 00:35:32,964
WILLIAM BROHNER: I'm
getting confused.

590
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,100
Who is this guy?

591
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,403
Don't be so impatient.

592
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:40,972
WILLIAM BROHNER: When we met in
the park, you were panhandling.

593
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,908
Yeah.

594
00:35:43,008 --> 00:35:45,244
I did a lot of things for money.

595
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,545
For Mexico.

596
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,146
I'm concerned about you.

597
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:50,148
Like, who do
you think you are?

598
00:35:50,249 --> 00:35:51,016
My father?

599
00:35:51,116 --> 00:35:51,817
No.

600
00:35:51,917 --> 00:35:53,285
Your friend.

601
00:35:53,385 --> 00:35:54,286
No.

602
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,021
You're not my
doctor, or my lawyer,

603
00:35:56,121 --> 00:35:58,490
or my lover, or my anything.

604
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:02,228
You're just a pathetic ex-junkie
who flushed his academic career

605
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:04,663
down the toilet,
got on SSI, and lets

606
00:36:04,763 --> 00:36:07,032
me squat in his spare room.

607
00:36:07,132 --> 00:36:08,967
I don't rate that.

608
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:12,003
Maybe not, but that's
what I'm giving out today.

609
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:15,774
So you can either
take it or leave it.

610
00:36:15,874 --> 00:36:17,376
I'm going to crash
for a couple of hours.

611
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:18,176
Great.

612
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,481
[sighs]

613
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:23,949
[door closing]

614
00:36:39,164 --> 00:36:41,066
[sighs]

615
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,946
Guess I was done
with that coffee.

616
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:55,781
I'm sorry.

617
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:56,748
You want me to make some more?

618
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,218
Look.

619
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,488
I realize this is
probably turning you on,

620
00:37:02,588 --> 00:37:04,656
but the only way you're
getting in my pants

621
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:05,924
is over my dead body.

622
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,398
What's so funny?

623
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:15,000
You think I'm that pathetic?

624
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,402
Uh-uh.

625
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,537
It's just an inside joke.

626
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,005
I only want to help.

627
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:21,707
That's all.

628
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:27,313
Thanks, really, but no.

629
00:37:27,413 --> 00:37:30,516
WILLIAM BROHNER: Why does
Marty put up with this?

630
00:37:30,616 --> 00:37:32,684
Not why you think.

631
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:33,485
He owes me.

632
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:43,462
[sighs] Marty was--
Marty's a smart guy.

633
00:37:43,562 --> 00:37:45,196
He's a tenured professor.

634
00:37:45,297 --> 00:37:48,367
Popular, but
everyone disappeared

635
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:50,602
when he crashed and burned.

636
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,237
WILLIAM BROHNER: Except you.

637
00:37:52,338 --> 00:37:53,305
Yeah.

638
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:58,610
I mean, all I did was
heat up TV dinners

639
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,812
and I drove him to meetings.

640
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:03,715
But I did do that.

641
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,652
[cart noise]

642
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,591
[traffic noise]

643
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:22,468
[police scanner]

644
00:38:32,678 --> 00:38:36,047
[moaning]

645
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:56,468
[footsteps]

646
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:01,940
[traffic noise]

647
00:39:06,412 --> 00:39:07,178
Spare any change?

648
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:09,581
I don't carry cash.

649
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,949
Right.

650
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:13,118
And I'm sure you bought that
churro with your platinum card,

651
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:15,086
asshole.

652
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:19,324
Honey's better than vinegar.

653
00:39:19,425 --> 00:39:23,061
Thanks for the advice,
but handle your own case.

654
00:39:23,161 --> 00:39:23,862
I'm just sayin'.

655
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:29,701
Good luck to you, girly.

656
00:39:29,801 --> 00:39:32,137
Same to you.

657
00:39:32,237 --> 00:39:34,139
(QUIETLY) Fuckin' bums, man.

658
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:35,140
Hang back a bit.

659
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,646
Get a job, bitch.

660
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,180
Hey, she looks
like your cousin.

661
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,381
What?

662
00:39:43,482 --> 00:39:45,283
No way that piece of white
trash is like my cousin.

663
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,285
You know, I'm
not deaf, you know.

664
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,921
And fuck you, loser.

665
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:50,722
Ah.

666
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:56,227
Fuck me?

667
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:58,597
Loser?

668
00:39:58,697 --> 00:39:59,865
Are you high?

669
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:02,300
I'm just telling
it like I see it.

670
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,903
You keep that up
if you want to die.

671
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,137
You fucking slut!
- Hey.

672
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,072
Are you nuts?

673
00:40:07,172 --> 00:40:10,008
Not here, man.

674
00:40:10,108 --> 00:40:10,909
You're right.

675
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,277
You're right.

676
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:15,013
[punch]

677
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:17,348
Who's the loser now, huh?

678
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,585
Come on, let's go.

679
00:40:19,685 --> 00:40:20,586
Dude.

680
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:23,254
Let's go.

681
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:28,159
I see you again, you punk-ass
skank, and I will put you down.

682
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,464
Fuck. [chuckling] (WHISPERING)
Fucking piece of shit.

683
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,879
Are you OK?

684
00:40:47,979 --> 00:40:51,416
Well, I'm not
great, but I'm OK.

685
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,188
I've seen what they do.

686
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:01,860
I've seen them here
before doing bad shit.

687
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,665
[speaking spanish]

688
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,268
Someday the karmic
wheel will turn.

689
00:41:10,368 --> 00:41:11,937
Como?

690
00:41:12,037 --> 00:41:16,441
[speaking spanish]

691
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:18,977
Ah, si.

692
00:41:19,077 --> 00:41:27,218
[speaking spanish]

693
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,820
I like that line of yours.

694
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,856
Hot, black, and made this year.

695
00:41:30,956 --> 00:41:32,357
WILLIAM BROHNER: Well,
it's not mine, really.

696
00:41:32,457 --> 00:41:34,059
I stole it.

697
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:36,227
That figures.

698
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,397
You know, sometimes
I feel like Diogenes.

699
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:40,866
WILLIAM BROHNER: Sometimes
it's hard to tell

700
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:43,101
when you're joking.

701
00:41:43,201 --> 00:41:44,536
Why would I joke
about someone who

702
00:41:44,636 --> 00:41:46,738
plucked a chicken
to mock Plato's

703
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:48,907
pseudo definition of man?

704
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,041
WILLIAM BROHNER: Plato.

705
00:41:50,141 --> 00:41:52,578
All I knew about it the
routine with the lamb.

706
00:41:52,678 --> 00:41:55,146
Then you'd lose on "Jeopardy."

707
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,283
Diogenes believed
that mankind is

708
00:41:58,383 --> 00:42:00,819
more concerned about
the appearance of evil

709
00:42:00,919 --> 00:42:03,188
than evil itself.

710
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:06,024
WILLIAM BROHNER: Really?

711
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:08,694
You think I'm making
this shit up as I go along?

712
00:42:08,794 --> 00:42:10,295
WILLIAM BROHNER:
I'm still not sure.

713
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:11,963
Laozi, Diogenes?

714
00:42:12,063 --> 00:42:13,198
Maybe you should go
into [inaudible],

715
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:14,600
make some of that
money you need.

716
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,367
[chuckles] Very funny.

717
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:22,007
ROWENA (VOICEOVER): I go to
the downtown library, to IM.

718
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,375
I used to love that library.

719
00:42:24,475 --> 00:42:29,247
Now it's just a place full
of useless information.

720
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:30,716
It's like a giant
version of the room

721
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:36,287
at Marty's-- books everywhere,
but no real knowledge.

722
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,490
Nothing that can help me.

723
00:42:39,591 --> 00:42:42,460
At the end of the hall, there's
a room with internet stations.

724
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,898
That's how I talk to
Hildegard, the woman in Mexico.

725
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:50,235
Like me, but older.

726
00:42:50,335 --> 00:42:53,939
At one time, long ago,
she was a scientist.

727
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,406
An alchemist.

728
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:59,678
Back then, they were suspicious
of any woman seeking knowledge.

729
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:02,147
The cures she found
using plants and herbs,

730
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:04,883
that could be witchcraft.

731
00:43:04,983 --> 00:43:06,752
WILLIAM BRONER (VOICEOVER):
How did you find this woman?

732
00:43:06,852 --> 00:43:08,553
ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
Why does that matter?

733
00:43:08,654 --> 00:43:09,888
I found her.

734
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,857
WILLIAM BRONER (VOICEOVER):
Have you ever seen this person?

735
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:15,560
ROWENA (VOICEOVER): No,
but maybe she can help me.

736
00:43:15,661 --> 00:43:18,163
Maybe she can give
me a future again.

737
00:43:18,263 --> 00:43:20,498
Can I help you, miss?

738
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,501
Oh, I'm just
waiting for the bus.

739
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:27,973
We pay someone to clean
those windows every morning.

740
00:43:28,073 --> 00:43:29,808
Think the bus stop
is over there.

741
00:43:33,745 --> 00:43:36,081
Toodles.

ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
I hate Hollywood.

745
00:44:38,744 --> 00:44:40,779
There's nothing real.

746
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:44,082
Batmen, wookies,
and Marilyn Monroes.

747
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:46,117
WILLIAM BRONER (VOICEOVER):
So why do you go there?

748
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:47,418
ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
To get money.

749
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,720
For the stuff I steal.

750
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,221

00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,224
Hey.

753
00:44:59,998 --> 00:45:02,968
These little [inaudible]
are out of fashion now.

754
00:45:03,068 --> 00:45:03,769
You don't say.

755
00:45:09,374 --> 00:45:10,541
Want the box?

756
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,177
Give me a break.

757
00:45:12,277 --> 00:45:14,445
It's worth more with the box.

758
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,815
That is, of course, if
you care about the money.

759
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,283
Right.

760
00:45:18,383 --> 00:45:19,284
$200.

761
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,786
All right.

762
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,788
Fine.

763
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:25,023
By the way, that
stuff is crap.

764
00:45:25,123 --> 00:45:26,792
I'd recommend the
Rembrandt Plus, wintergreen

765
00:45:26,892 --> 00:45:28,493
flavor with peroxide.

766
00:45:28,593 --> 00:45:32,630
Yeah, well not everyone can
afford the [inaudible] brands.

767
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,034
I'm just saying it's
cheaper than the dentist.

768
00:45:36,134 --> 00:45:37,568
I'm curious.

769
00:45:37,668 --> 00:45:39,304
What's this all about, anyway?

770
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:42,407
You don't really seem the type.

771
00:45:42,507 --> 00:45:44,375
I wasn't aware that there
was a type for petty theft

772
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:45,977
and shoplifting.

773
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:46,778
Yeah, there is.

774
00:45:46,878 --> 00:45:47,913
And it's not you.

775
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:53,351
What are you so
pissed off about?

776
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:55,220
Or is it who?

777
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,554
Punks piss me off.

778
00:45:56,654 --> 00:45:59,057
Especially those who've had
to play amateur psychologist

779
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:01,626
while giving lectures
on dental hygiene.

780
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,395
Nice doing business
with you, then.

781
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:07,332
See you next week, same time?

782
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:10,335
Yeah.

783
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:11,803
Give me a minute.

00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,673
Here, look.

788
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:51,142
Let's go over there.

789
00:46:51,242 --> 00:46:53,344
OK.

[inaudible]

791
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,620
There's a spot down there.

792
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:08,759
Uh, hey.

793
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,328
My name is Susannah.

794
00:47:10,428 --> 00:47:11,129
Hi.

795
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:12,097
I'm Rowena.

796
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:13,364
You're Rowena.

797
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:14,165
How pretty.

798
00:47:14,265 --> 00:47:15,566
What kind of name is that?

799
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,869
It's Celtic.

800
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:21,706
Uh, my fiance, Elvis,
and I, we're from Norway.

801
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:23,708
Until recently they
had super strict laws

802
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:25,510
against foreign names there.

803
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:26,311
You're kidding.

804
00:47:26,411 --> 00:47:27,245
Elvis?

805
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:28,646
Uh, yeah.

806
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:30,748
Well, that's a Norwegian name.

807
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,017
Mine is trickier.

808
00:47:32,117 --> 00:47:35,053
But it's from the
Bible, so it's OK.

809
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:37,488
My middle name is Celtic, too.

810
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,357
Arolilia.

811
00:47:39,457 --> 00:47:45,130
"Ar-oh-lily-a." [chuckles] It
means lily of the wasteland.

812
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,397
[laughs] Really?

813
00:47:46,497 --> 00:47:47,198
Yeah.

814
00:47:47,298 --> 00:47:49,000
What does your name mean?

815
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,438
Um, it means fair and slender.

816
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:55,773
Not as much character
as Arolilia.

817
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:59,010
Uh, could you help us and
take our picture, please?

818
00:47:59,110 --> 00:47:59,810
Sure.

819
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:03,848

820
00:48:03,949 --> 00:48:04,649
Hello.

821
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:05,683
Hi.

00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:07,552
Uh, so it's in still mode.

to start and stop.

00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:09,955

Well, uh, you stay safe.

ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
Looking for answers, alone,

866
00:49:43,014 --> 00:49:48,486
without a reassuring
glance was exhausting.

867
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:52,823
It's getting harder to remember
the old Rowena, the one

868
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:55,160
without a secret.

869
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:59,330
It was getting harder and
harder to go see Andrew,

871
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:06,171

say that, Rowena?

I'm really happy to see you.

00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,182
It was a joke.

She has to stay with
you, here at her home.

Around.

get stuff for me, Rowena.

If you don't talk
about something else,

I'm going to have to leave.

00:52:08,193 --> 00:52:08,893
OK.

914
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:13,198
Your mom called me.

915
00:52:13,298 --> 00:52:15,900
[sighs]

916
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,902
OK.

917
00:52:18,002 --> 00:52:19,404
You talk, then.

918
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:22,340
I'm thinking about
going to Mexico.

919
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,242
Why?

920
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:27,845
Well, it's probably
just a wild goose chase,

921
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:31,216
but I think I might
have found somebody who

922
00:52:31,316 --> 00:52:35,686
could help me with my problem.

923
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:38,088
A doctor?

924
00:52:38,189 --> 00:52:39,089
More like an anthropologist.

925
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:44,429
Don't you think a
doctor might be better?

926
00:52:44,529 --> 00:52:46,163
A head shrinker, you mean.

927
00:52:46,264 --> 00:52:49,334
Just a normal doctor.

928
00:52:49,434 --> 00:52:51,769
You just don't realize it.

929
00:52:51,869 --> 00:52:55,740
There's nothing normal
about my problem.

930
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,042
How can I realize when
you won't tell me anything?

931
00:52:58,142 --> 00:52:59,344
When I don't know anything?

932
00:53:03,414 --> 00:53:06,784
I am sorry.

933
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,786
Really.

934
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:11,256
I am.

935
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:13,258
You should eat something.

936
00:53:13,358 --> 00:53:15,760
What about you?

937
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,428
I had something earlier.

938
00:53:22,066 --> 00:53:22,767
I'll call you.

ROWENA (VOICEOVER): Even
with a reassuring glance

940
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,045
looking for answers, does it
always have to be exhausting?

941
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,147
WILLIAM BROHNER: Is
this woman in Mexico

942
00:53:37,248 --> 00:53:39,684
really an anthropologist?

943
00:53:39,784 --> 00:53:41,419
What is this all about?

944
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,687
ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
We'll get to that.

945
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,154
Just give me a moment.

946
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:47,592
[music playing]

947
00:53:58,936 --> 00:54:01,539
Did I hurt you that night?

948
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,341
Not really.

949
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:07,011
When paths cross, it
doesn't always end well.

950
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:09,747
Some don't believe
in live and let live.

951
00:54:09,847 --> 00:54:13,351
Or live and let die.

952
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:16,287
Sense of humor.

953
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:20,725
Yeah, I'm trying to get
past the graveyard humor.

954
00:54:20,825 --> 00:54:29,500
So if I wanted to end this, I
guess the sun has no effect.

955
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,502
No.

956
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:34,872
And jumping from
a tall building?

957
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:36,341
Hanging?

958
00:54:36,441 --> 00:54:37,975
Slitting my wrists?

959
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:39,577
Garlic milkshake?

960
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:40,478
Funny again.

961
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:46,951
I have never really
found much humor in it.

962
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:49,820
What if I run into
a sharpened stake?

963
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:52,156
Myth.

964
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:54,091
This whole thing is a myth.

965
00:54:54,191 --> 00:54:57,395
I mean, how can you
and I even exist?

966
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:58,896
How can anything
abnormal exist?

967
00:54:58,996 --> 00:55:01,666
Is a deadly virus abnormal?

968
00:55:01,766 --> 00:55:05,069
Are we even abnormal
except in context?

969
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:09,206
Well, a deadly
virus, you can kill.

970
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:10,575
Morality can win.

971
00:55:10,675 --> 00:55:14,912
I thought you came back to
ask me how to live with this.

972
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:15,713
No.

973
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,852
The molecular structure
of your body has changed.

974
00:55:21,952 --> 00:55:23,320
Your skin will part
to escape puncture

975
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,122
from the thickest blade.

976
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:27,157
Just stop it.

977
00:55:27,257 --> 00:55:29,360
You're telling me that
I'm living in some sort

978
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:32,262
of comic book world.

979
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:34,031
There has to be a way out.

980
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:37,668
If there's a way out,
for normality to win,

981
00:55:37,768 --> 00:55:39,236
I don't know it.

982
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,440
Do-- do we even get older?

983
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,409
Yeah.

984
00:55:44,509 --> 00:55:46,544
But slowly.

985
00:55:46,644 --> 00:55:47,344
How's that tied in?

986
00:55:50,915 --> 00:55:53,651
I'm taking a trip.

987
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:55,553
Where exactly in Mexico?

988
00:55:55,653 --> 00:55:58,856
By train?

989
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:01,358
I don't know where it is.

990
00:56:01,459 --> 00:56:04,361
I'm a little lost.

991
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:07,465
Won't change anything
to go all existential.

992
00:56:07,565 --> 00:56:08,699
I tried that.

993
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:18,308
How long ago was it for you?

994
00:56:18,409 --> 00:56:21,579
A while.

995
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:22,947
Right after Tricky
Dick resigned.

996
00:56:27,084 --> 00:56:29,119
1974.

997
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:31,355
Since then.

998
00:56:31,456 --> 00:56:32,557
Let me show you a few things.

Oh my god!

1002
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:59,083
How did you-- how did we get--

1003
00:57:04,021 --> 00:57:06,691
WILLIAM BROHNER: You OK?

1004
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,226
Obviously not.

1005
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:10,928
What did Andrew say to you?

1006
00:57:11,028 --> 00:57:12,797
WILLIAM BROHNER: That you
don't suffer fools gladly.

1007
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:20,705
Do you suffer fools gladly,
seeing you yourself are wise?

1008
00:57:20,805 --> 00:57:22,272
WILLIAM BROHNER: Sorry,
I don't know the quote.

1009
00:57:25,943 --> 00:57:27,478
St. Paul's second
letter to the Corinthians.

1010
00:57:30,314 --> 00:57:33,684
"I delight in insults
and hardships.

1011
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:37,321
For when I am weak,
then I am strong.

1012
00:57:37,421 --> 00:57:41,258
If I have become a fool,
I was driven to it."

1013
00:57:41,358 --> 00:57:44,028
WILLIAM BROHNER: Are
you still religious?

1014
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,930
I was never religious.

1015
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,532
Just forced to read the Bible.

1016
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:49,767
Stop making stupid assumptions.

00:58:16,727 --> 00:58:17,494
I'm getting tired.

00:58:17,595 --> 00:58:20,364
Are we almost done?

1021
00:58:20,464 --> 00:58:22,432
WILLIAM BROHNER: You tell me.

1022
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,902
It's not real for you.

1023
00:58:25,002 --> 00:58:28,539
Nothing-- the questions, core
values-- is real for you.

1024
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:29,540
Is it?

1025
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,780
Where you going?

1026
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:38,115
Same place I came
from this morning.

1027
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:39,249
Out.

1028
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:40,751
I was going to make dinner.

1029
00:58:40,851 --> 00:58:43,921
Oh, I had something
a while ago.

1030
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:47,224
I've never seen you eat.

Sorry I didn't check
with you or anything.

Don't worry.

00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:52,897
I'm not anorexic.

1034
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:55,265
Want something to drink, then?

1035
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:56,867
Did you buy any diet soda?

1036
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:57,868
Sure did.

1037
00:59:08,913 --> 00:59:10,214
Thanks.

1038
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:13,784
You ever going to tell me why
you go out dressed like that?

1039
00:59:13,884 --> 00:59:14,652
OK.

1040
00:59:14,752 --> 00:59:15,620
I will.

1041
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17,955
But I don't want
any static about it.

1042
00:59:18,055 --> 00:59:18,956
Deal?

1043
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:19,757
Agreed.

the local schools.

me in the morning

about finishing the term.

1052
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:42,379
Congrats.

1053
00:59:42,479 --> 00:59:46,216
Yeah, uh, we'll see.

1054
00:59:46,316 --> 00:59:49,486
So your mood is elevated.

You know I'm a night person.

1058
00:59:54,224 --> 00:59:55,125
Hm.

1059
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:55,926
And--

1060
00:59:58,195 --> 00:59:59,229
There are some
bars where I have

1061
00:59:59,329 --> 01:00:01,431
an arrangement to cage drinks.

1062
01:00:01,531 --> 01:00:03,167
No more, no less.

1063
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:04,501
Can I ask you a
question about this?

1064
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,936
No value judgments.

1065
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:07,404
Go ahead.

1066
01:00:07,504 --> 01:00:09,640
Do they give you
money for this?

1067
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:10,641
Of course not.

1068
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:12,009
I do it all for fun.

1069
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:14,444
How much money does a
b-girl make for that work?

1070
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:16,213
A b-girl?

1071
01:00:16,313 --> 01:00:18,315
You watch too many
old movies, Marty.

1072
01:00:18,415 --> 01:00:20,017

Between $15 to $20 an
hour, depending on the bar.

1074
01:00:23,688 --> 01:00:25,155
Sometimes I get $1 a drink, too.

1075
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:25,956
Really?

1076
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:27,257
And that's worth it to them?

For real, sugar.

1078
01:00:28,425 --> 01:00:30,761
Didn't you just buy me one?

1079
01:00:30,861 --> 01:00:32,529
And that works?

1080
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,665
You don't think the guys
want to buy me drinks?

1081
01:00:34,765 --> 01:00:36,834
You think I didn't notice
you checking out my thigh

when I was putting on my boots?

1083

I did not do that.

01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:10,000
So how much profit is there in
an extra $3 or $4 cocktails?

1096
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,201
Plenty.

1097
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:14,304
I mean, besides the fact
that I class the place up,

1098
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,240
they don't actually
serve me liquor.

1099
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,943
My Cuba Libre has
two drops of rum,

1100
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:20,745
watery Coke, and a used lime.

1101
01:01:20,845 --> 01:01:23,147
But I drink it right
down and I say,

1102
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:25,282
"How about another, sweetie?"

1103
01:01:25,382 --> 01:01:26,951
Which is why I'm not
going to finish this.

1104
01:01:27,051 --> 01:01:28,352
Don't worry about it.

1105
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:29,754
I won't.

1106
01:01:29,854 --> 01:01:32,122
Satisfied now?

1107
01:01:32,222 --> 01:01:34,925
Enlightened, at least.

1108
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:37,427
Epilepsy.

1109
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,396
I wish.

[music playing]

1111
01:01:48,906 --> 01:01:50,808
ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
Marty means well.

1112
01:01:50,908 --> 01:01:53,010
It's something about him.

1113
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,511
His affliction.

1114
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:56,513
His salvation.

01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:09,493
What do you want?

1118
01:02:09,593 --> 01:02:13,063
Did I do something?

1119
01:02:13,163 --> 01:02:13,864
To you?

1120
01:02:19,203 --> 01:02:20,971
Did you see this paper?

1121
01:02:27,077 --> 01:02:28,879
I thought you might like
it for your scrapbook.

1122
01:02:33,984 --> 01:02:36,787
Do you think this
is what I want?

1123
01:02:36,887 --> 01:02:40,657
What you want
and don't want, I

1124
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:42,059
ain't all up in that Kool-Aid.

1125
01:02:42,159 --> 01:02:44,594
And I ain't bent, either.

1126
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:47,364
Well, then what do
you suggest that I do?

1127
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:48,365
Oh.

1128
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,900
So now you take me for a friend.

1129
01:02:52,702 --> 01:02:57,241
Well, you talk to T. Jones,
your shrink, anybody.

1130
01:02:57,341 --> 01:03:00,110
But leave me be.

1131
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,948
You don't think that I
would like to change this?

1132
01:03:04,048 --> 01:03:06,550
But right now--

1133
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:07,985
Do you think that
I've been broke

1134
01:03:08,085 --> 01:03:12,857
and [inaudible] all of my life?

1135
01:03:12,957 --> 01:03:14,691
You think that when I
first hit the streets,

1136
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:23,400
I didn't tell myself, [sigh]
won't always be life like this.

1137
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,170
So what are you saying?

1138
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:32,409
Thought I was belaboring
the obvious again.

1139
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:33,844
You need to get ghost, girl.

1140
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:42,086
Navigate out of here
before the laws are on you.

1141
01:03:45,289 --> 01:03:47,491
I've been thinking
about going down south.

1142
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,659
There you go.

1143
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:55,432
Mexico lindo, where
life is cheap.

[music playing]

1145
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:02,206
I don't understand
all the mechanics.

1146
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:06,410
That you could think
about a place, a person.

1147
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:07,777
Somehow you go then.

1148
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,384
You really didn't like
that guy Haney, did you?

1149
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,127
Just takes a little
effort to see

1150
01:04:23,227 --> 01:04:24,694
what's inside someone's head.

1151
01:04:27,497 --> 01:04:28,832
No.

1152
01:04:28,933 --> 01:04:32,269
Or to tell what you think.

1153
01:04:32,369 --> 01:04:33,971
Why so gloomy, Rowena?

1154
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:49,053
There's nothing to be afraid
of out there in the dark.

1155
01:04:49,153 --> 01:04:51,555
No one can touch you.

1156
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:54,524
Nothing can hurt you.

Hey, I think that
chick's following us.

1165
01:06:19,509 --> 01:06:20,344
So what?

1166
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:21,678
Yeah, but why
would she do that?

1167
01:06:21,778 --> 01:06:22,679
Who gives a fuck?

1168
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:26,683
Hey!

1169
01:06:30,754 --> 01:06:32,656
Yeah?

1170
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:34,191
I know you?

1171
01:06:34,291 --> 01:06:35,825
This morning.

1172
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:40,264
You said, and I quote, "I'll see
you again, you punk-ass skank.

1173
01:06:40,364 --> 01:06:43,167
And I'll put you down."

1174
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,168
She got it.

1175
01:06:44,268 --> 01:06:45,835
Still looks like your sister.

1176
01:06:45,935 --> 01:06:47,937
Would you shut the
fuck up with that shit?

1177
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:53,310
Wow, you do look different.

1178
01:06:53,410 --> 01:06:58,082
You know, you're
as ugly as ever.

1179
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:00,250
Maybe it's the lighting.

1180
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,451
I doubt it.

1181
01:07:01,551 --> 01:07:03,487
You know, I'm going
to revise my statement.

1182
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:05,855
Instead of I will put
you down, how about

1183
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:07,824
I will fuck your brains out?

1184
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:09,626
Hm.

1185
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:11,961
But I should
probably use protection

1186
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,697
'cause you're for
sure a punk-ass skank.

1187
01:07:13,797 --> 01:07:14,498
Listen, Haney.

1188
01:07:19,503 --> 01:07:22,306
So how much you charge, honey?

1189
01:07:22,406 --> 01:07:24,074
Not that I plan on paying.

1190
01:07:24,174 --> 01:07:26,910
For you, Haney?

1191
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:28,011
On the house.

1192
01:07:28,112 --> 01:07:30,114
Ooh.

1193
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:31,014
Come on over here.

1194
01:07:31,115 --> 01:07:32,516
I know a place.

Mm, cute.

01:07:58,375 --> 01:08:00,277
Why not get comfortable?

1200
01:08:00,377 --> 01:08:01,077
How about my pal?

1201
01:08:02,779 --> 01:08:04,281
Mm, we'll see.

1202
01:08:04,381 --> 01:08:06,150
After.

1203
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,551
Oh, come on.

1204
01:08:07,651 --> 01:08:08,885
You've got to give
out some samples

1205
01:08:08,985 --> 01:08:11,155
to generate trade, right?

1206
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:13,823
All's he'd want is a blow job.

1207
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:15,825
Well, I do have a
very unusual mouth.

1208
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:16,626
Oh.

1209
01:08:16,726 --> 01:08:18,762
Pierced tongue?

1210
01:08:18,862 --> 01:08:20,730
Nice, sharp teeth.

Sting ray.

1212
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:24,168
Maybe I should try one.

1213
01:08:24,268 --> 01:08:24,968
Sure.

1214
01:08:25,068 --> 01:08:27,371
But no freebies on those.

1215
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:28,572
OK, I'll bite.

1216
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:29,806
How much?

1217
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:30,940
$100.

1218
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:33,243
And I'll [inaudible].

1219
01:08:33,343 --> 01:08:36,713
[laughs] You got a real sense
of humor, don't you, bitch?

1220
01:08:36,813 --> 01:08:40,184
You know, I really don't
like being called that.

1221
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:44,188
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause
I'm sure it happens a lot.

1222
01:08:44,288 --> 01:08:46,623
Come on.

1223
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:48,558
Let's get to it.

1224
01:08:48,658 --> 01:08:50,994

1225
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:53,697
Well, what about you, stud?

1226
01:08:53,797 --> 01:08:56,233
I'll just drop my pants.

1227
01:08:56,333 --> 01:08:57,634
What, are you shy?

1228
01:08:57,734 --> 01:09:00,637
I thought you'd be eager
to show off your muscles.

1229
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:02,239
[laughing] Can't
believe this bitch.

1230
01:09:04,941 --> 01:09:08,312
Come on, baby.

1231
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:11,781
Hey, not so fast.

1232
01:09:11,881 --> 01:09:13,750
You know why?

1233
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:15,719
I think you like it hot.

1234
01:09:19,756 --> 01:09:21,658
Happy now?

1235
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:22,626
Gettin' there.

1236
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:30,334
Hey, I said I would
do the biting.

1237
01:09:30,434 --> 01:09:31,301
So go ahead.

1238
01:09:35,805 --> 01:09:37,173
Is this getting you hot?

1239
01:09:40,710 --> 01:09:43,247
I mean, you really
aren't friendly.

1240
01:09:43,347 --> 01:09:46,316
You just like to prance around
in your [inaudible] leather

cute little wing man.

Ah, fuck, you got some claws!

Pay attention, numb-nuts,
because these are the last

1244

moments of your worthless life.

[crying out in pain]

1246
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:02,999
You sure you still want
your friend to have a taste?

01:10:03,099 --> 01:10:06,470
He doesn't seem like
a real asshole to me.

[groaning]

1249
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:11,275
He shouldn't have
to die just because he

1250
01:10:11,375 --> 01:10:13,343
hangs out with a useless
piece of shit like you.

1251
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:16,112
Should he?

1252
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,983
So Haney, what do
you think of that?

1257
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:29,926
I think we should make
this last [inaudible].

Don't you?

1259
01:10:30,827 --> 01:10:31,961
[gagging] No.

1260
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:32,962
Please.

1261
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:33,797
Don't.

1262
01:10:33,897 --> 01:10:34,598
Please?

1263
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:35,399
Sorry.

1264
01:10:35,499 --> 01:10:36,666
No mercy.

1265
01:10:36,766 --> 01:10:40,504
This is for every person,
man or woman, you've hurt.

1266
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:42,306
And you've probably
tortured animals.

1267
01:10:42,406 --> 01:10:44,073
It's for them, too.

1268
01:10:44,173 --> 01:10:46,676

ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
Eddie was right.

He said that life
was cheap everywhere.

up from your nap,

01:11:11,701 --> 01:11:14,170
what about hanging out
with another fine crowd.

1274
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:17,106
[music playing]

1275
01:11:18,708 --> 01:11:22,379
And you can rot in hell.

1276
01:11:22,479 --> 01:11:24,614
ROWENA (VOICEOVER): Life
is cheap everywhere.

1277
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:27,116
And I'm not the only
one that knows it.

1278
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:30,019
[background chatter]

1279
01:11:32,589 --> 01:11:33,323
Huh.

1280
01:11:33,423 --> 01:11:35,425
Figured you got hung up tonight.

1281
01:11:35,525 --> 01:11:37,394
Ah, I just had to
take out some trash.

1282
01:11:42,666 --> 01:11:45,935
Ever think about
getting a purse?

1283
01:11:46,035 --> 01:11:47,203
Too bulky.

1284
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:49,439
I'm talking about one of
those little black numbers

1285
01:11:49,539 --> 01:11:50,507
with gold chain strap.

1286
01:11:50,607 --> 01:11:53,042
I mean, it would go
with your outfit.

1287
01:11:53,142 --> 01:11:54,043
Mm.

1288
01:11:54,143 --> 01:11:55,178
On the other hand,
I'm guessing there

1289
01:11:55,278 --> 01:11:57,514
are some parts of town
where a purse like that

1290
01:11:57,614 --> 01:12:01,385
is an easy target.

1291
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:02,819
Oh, look!

1292
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:03,787
Cute charm.

1293
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:06,656
It's a motorcycle jacket.

1294
01:12:06,756 --> 01:12:08,257
Right.

1295
01:12:08,358 --> 01:12:10,026
So what's the total?

1296
01:12:10,126 --> 01:12:13,530
Um, tonight or all together?

1297
01:12:13,630 --> 01:12:16,332
All together, please, Jeannie.

1298
01:12:16,433 --> 01:12:19,536
$9,647.

1299
01:12:19,636 --> 01:12:21,605
I guess I have
to speed things up.

1300
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:25,875
Bye.

1301
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:29,913
Without looking through a
window, the way to salvation

1302
01:12:30,013 --> 01:12:32,616
can be seen.

1303
01:12:32,716 --> 01:12:37,387
The farther one travels,
the less one discovers.

1304
01:12:37,487 --> 01:12:38,722
WILLIAM BROHNER: So
you think this money

1305
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:42,225
will buy what you need?

1306
01:12:42,325 --> 01:12:44,694
Why are you not listening?

1307
01:12:44,794 --> 01:12:46,295
WILLIAM BROHNER: You
really expect answers from

1308
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:49,065
some mystery woman in Mexico?

1309
01:12:49,165 --> 01:12:51,067
One answer.

1310
01:12:51,167 --> 01:12:54,571
How to stop being alive
and dead at the same time.

1311
01:12:54,671 --> 01:12:56,840
WILLIAM BROHNER: Can't you
just accept the Daoist dilemma?

1312
01:12:56,940 --> 01:12:59,876
The farther one goes,
the less one knows?

1313
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:02,045
Being opposites
occupy the same space.

1314
01:13:05,148 --> 01:13:08,685
How many times are you
going to make me say fuck you?

1315
01:13:08,785 --> 01:13:10,219
WILLIAM BROHNER:
As many times as it

1316
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:14,057
takes to get to the truth.

1317
01:13:14,157 --> 01:13:16,325
It's a double effect.

1318
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:20,263
There is no truth,
only consequence.

1319
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:21,330
WILLIAM BROHNER: I don't follow.

1320
01:13:21,431 --> 01:13:22,365
Double effect?

1321
01:13:22,466 --> 01:13:24,033
MARTY: Rowena, you in there?

1322
01:13:24,133 --> 01:13:25,835
Who else would
be in here, Marty?

1323
01:13:25,935 --> 01:13:28,137
MARTY: I need to take a leak.

1324
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:29,272
All right.
Well, come on in.

1325
01:13:29,372 --> 01:13:30,073
The door's unlocked.

1326
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:35,044
MARTY: Sorry.

1327
01:13:35,144 --> 01:13:37,013
I couldn't hold it any longer.

1328
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,882
No problem.

1329
01:13:38,982 --> 01:13:40,684
You had your prostate
checked recently?

1330
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,486
MARTY: There's
nothing wrong with me.

1331
01:13:42,586 --> 01:13:45,021
Now, that's a
matter of opinion.

1332
01:13:45,121 --> 01:13:47,056
MARTY: Fuck you, Rowena.

1333
01:13:47,156 --> 01:13:47,857
Marty!

1334
01:13:47,957 --> 01:13:48,792
I'm shocked!

1335
01:13:48,892 --> 01:13:49,926
I mean it.

1336
01:13:50,026 --> 01:13:52,696
I'm tired of you running
me down all the time.

1337
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:53,830
All right.

1338
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,999
Well, it's healthy to
let those feelings out.

1339
01:13:56,099 --> 01:13:58,134
I'll try to do better.

1340
01:13:58,234 --> 01:13:59,536
You will?

1341
01:13:59,636 --> 01:14:00,870
What'd I just say?

1342
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:02,772
Good.

1343
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:04,240
[flush]

1344
01:14:04,340 --> 01:14:06,643
Marty?

1345
01:14:06,743 --> 01:14:07,611
The seat?

1346
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:11,481
Thank you.

1347
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:23,627
Telepathy seems to be based
on strong feeling-- love, hate.

1348
01:14:23,727 --> 01:14:25,962
Do you live around here?

1349
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:29,098
I told you, I ride the trains.

1350
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,366
Doesn't that get expensive?

1351
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,435
All those tickets?

1352
01:14:32,536 --> 01:14:33,970
Tickets?

1353
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:35,839
I don't need no
stinking tickets.

1354
01:14:38,775 --> 01:14:43,847
Suppose the conductor comes
up to me and says, "Excuse me,

1355
01:14:43,947 --> 01:14:51,855
sir, would you mind
showing me your ticket?"

1356
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:52,856
Thank you, sir.

1357
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:53,757
Have a nice trip.

1358
01:14:53,857 --> 01:14:57,060
[music playing]

1359
01:15:01,931 --> 01:15:05,034
Jedi mind trick.

1360
01:15:05,134 --> 01:15:06,469
For real.

1361
01:15:06,570 --> 01:15:09,338
[music playing]

1362
01:15:10,907 --> 01:15:12,241
Hi.

1363
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:14,077
I'm sorry to call so early.

1364
01:15:17,814 --> 01:15:20,349
I figured that I
know you never really

1365
01:15:20,449 --> 01:15:21,885
could sleep during a full moon.

1366
01:15:27,991 --> 01:15:33,262
Um, I need to see you,
to-- to tell you something.

1367
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,767
Sure.

1368
01:15:37,867 --> 01:15:39,769
Fine.

1369
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,571
I'll meet you outside
around the corner, OK?

1370
01:15:47,911 --> 01:15:50,880
[footsteps]

1371
01:15:55,351 --> 01:15:59,122
I've killed people.

1372
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,691
Why would you-- why
would you say that, huh?

1373
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,760
Why-- why would you kill anyone?

1374
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,094
Because I have to.

1375
01:16:07,831 --> 01:16:11,167
To drink their blood.

1376
01:16:11,267 --> 01:16:14,503
You know, I, uh, I
have tried to be patient.

1377
01:16:14,604 --> 01:16:15,304
I have listened.

1378
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,572
I have waited.

1379
01:16:16,673 --> 01:16:18,307
If you have no more regard
for me, that is one thing.

1380
01:16:18,407 --> 01:16:20,610
But if you just sit here and--

1381
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,879
Look, I know it's
hard to believe.

1382
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:24,013
Hard to believe?

1383
01:16:24,113 --> 01:16:27,283
Rowena, this is-- it is
impossible to believe.

1384
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:28,752
What's next, alien abductions?

1385
01:16:28,852 --> 01:16:32,155
I mean-- I'm sorry.

1386
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:36,225
This is just really-- [sighs].

1387
01:16:36,325 --> 01:16:37,493
Don't be [inaudible].

1388
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,630
I just-- less than
two months ago,

1389
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:43,432
I would have said the
same thing, or worse.

1390
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:48,838
Jesus.

1391
01:16:48,938 --> 01:16:53,542
I took this off of a
man before I killed him.

1392
01:16:53,643 --> 01:16:54,811
I don't know why I took it.

1393
01:17:02,585 --> 01:17:04,721
Think it's a trick?

1394
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:07,156
Pull it up.

1395
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:07,957
Go ahead.

1396
01:17:23,472 --> 01:17:25,909
That's what I do now.

1397
01:17:26,009 --> 01:17:28,678
I murder.

1398
01:17:28,778 --> 01:17:31,547
I suck the life out of victims.

1399
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:34,117
No, I-- I've seen
you during the day.

1400
01:17:34,217 --> 01:17:35,351
This morning you were fine.

1401
01:17:35,451 --> 01:17:39,022
It's not like a comic book.

1402
01:17:39,122 --> 01:17:41,524
Daylight doesn't bother me.

1403
01:17:41,624 --> 01:17:44,427
But I feed at night.

1404
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:45,361
Feed.

1405
01:17:45,461 --> 01:17:47,363
I'm stronger at night.

1406
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:51,634
Look, I'm new to this, you know?

1407
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:58,174
But I met someone in
Mexico-- to-- not a woman,

1408
01:17:58,274 --> 01:18:01,044
but something like me.

1409
01:18:01,144 --> 01:18:05,448
Dead, infected, whatever I am.

1410
01:18:05,548 --> 01:18:07,884
Not normal.

1411
01:18:07,984 --> 01:18:09,819
Not human.

1412
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:12,388
Not human.

1413
01:18:12,488 --> 01:18:15,224
No.

1414
01:18:15,324 --> 01:18:18,261
Anyways, I have been
talking with her online.

1415
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:25,401
And she says that she can
control it, the addiction.

1416
01:18:25,501 --> 01:18:27,203
Can cure it?

1417
01:18:27,303 --> 01:18:28,537
I don't know.

1418
01:18:28,637 --> 01:18:32,842
But she wants me to come see
her-- with money, of course.

1419
01:18:32,942 --> 01:18:35,211
What is this, uh, lady's name?

1420
01:18:38,181 --> 01:18:39,248
Hildegard Magistra.

1421
01:18:39,348 --> 01:18:47,190
[chuckles] How much
does this Hildegard want?

1422
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:49,658
$50,000.

1423
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:52,661
That's all?

1424
01:18:52,762 --> 01:18:58,634
Look, Rowena, I can
do whatever you want.

1425
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:02,605
It's hopeless.

1426
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,110
Just take me home.

1427
01:19:17,653 --> 01:19:20,556
[water running]

1428
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,029
Hey.

1429
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:27,196
Hey yourself.

1430
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:28,231
What's up?

1431
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:31,835
That job interview,
it's this morning.

1432
01:19:31,935 --> 01:19:34,270
Oh, at the crack of dawn?

1433
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,772
It's at Chapman
in Orange County.

1434
01:19:36,873 --> 01:19:37,773
Oh.

1435
01:19:37,874 --> 01:19:40,176
Well, break a leg.

1436
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:42,178
Thank you.

1437
01:19:42,278 --> 01:19:50,553
Hey, if you get this job, I
just want to say that I know

1438
01:19:50,653 --> 01:19:53,322
I've been a total bitch.

1439
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:57,060
But I really appreciate--

1440
01:19:57,160 --> 01:20:06,903
Rowena, you were
the only one, when

1441
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:12,041
I hit bottom, that gave a damn.

1442
01:20:12,141 --> 01:20:16,779
Now, I don't know
what's really going on.

1443
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:17,780
But I don't care.

1444
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:27,823
If you need, I'm here.

1445
01:20:27,924 --> 01:20:28,824
[kiss]

1446
01:20:30,393 --> 01:20:31,794
Thank you.

1447
01:20:31,895 --> 01:20:33,296
(WHISPERING) You're welcome.

1448
01:20:33,396 --> 01:20:36,765
[music playing]

1449
01:20:50,947 --> 01:20:57,253
[blowing out breath]

1450
01:20:57,353 --> 01:21:00,823
You ain't scaring me no more.

1451
01:21:00,924 --> 01:21:03,459
Wasn't trying to.

1452
01:21:03,559 --> 01:21:04,527
What's up?

1453
01:21:04,627 --> 01:21:06,262
You tell me.

1454
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,297
I heard on the radio
about this dead guy

1455
01:21:08,397 --> 01:21:13,702
in a dumpster up in Hollywood,
lost a lot of blood.

1456
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:14,537
Happens to people.

1457
01:21:18,107 --> 01:21:21,744
Did they say anything
about a couple of bikers?

1458
01:21:21,844 --> 01:21:24,613
Fuck, girl, how many
did you do tonight?

1459
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,415
What's the difference?

1460
01:21:26,515 --> 01:21:28,084
They all deserved it.

1461
01:21:28,184 --> 01:21:30,987
Gettin' a little out
of control, ain't it?

1462
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:35,424
I mean, do you have a plan here?

1463
01:21:35,524 --> 01:21:37,160
I asked Andrew for the money.

1464
01:21:39,963 --> 01:21:41,264
My fiance.

1465
01:21:41,364 --> 01:21:43,366
All right.

1466
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:44,367
So it's good.

1467
01:21:48,237 --> 01:21:50,073
Who the hell knows?

1468
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:52,942
[music playing]

1469
01:21:56,445 --> 01:22:01,684
This woman in Mexico who
claims she's older, I mean,

1470
01:22:01,784 --> 01:22:06,022
bring me 50 Gs
and I'll cure you?

1471
01:22:06,122 --> 01:22:08,057
It's not possible?

1472
01:22:08,157 --> 01:22:10,193
Who can say?

1473
01:22:10,293 --> 01:22:12,295
Fine that your fiance's rich,
but it sounds like a waste

1474
01:22:12,395 --> 01:22:16,132
of time and money to me.

1475
01:22:16,232 --> 01:22:17,866
I've gotta try.

1476
01:22:17,967 --> 01:22:18,667
Sure.

1477
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:23,039
Let me know how it goes.

1478
01:22:23,139 --> 01:22:25,908
[music playing]

1479
01:22:32,715 --> 01:22:34,517
Just look inside.

1480
01:22:34,617 --> 01:22:36,485
See the truth of
it for yourself.

ROWENA (VOICEOVER):
The streets of Los

1483
01:22:56,372 --> 01:23:00,009
Angeles are still dark with
something more than night.

1484
01:23:00,109 --> 01:23:03,546
I wonder if it will be
like that in Mexico.

1485
01:23:03,646 --> 01:23:05,314
Will there be an answer there?

1486
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:06,115
Anywhere?

1487
01:23:12,255 --> 01:23:15,591
I don't know if I'll
ever see Andrew,

1488
01:23:15,691 --> 01:23:20,496
or Marty, or Eddie again.

1489
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:23,999
And like I told Travis, I
don't know whether or not

1490
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,968
Hildegard can help me.

1491
01:23:26,069 --> 01:23:28,971
But I have to try.

1492
01:23:29,072 --> 01:23:34,410
Whatever happens in Mexico, I
have to find a way to end this.

WILLIAM BROHNER: So what do
you mean by double effect?

1498
01:29:50,986 --> 01:29:53,422
St. Thomas Aquinas.

1499
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:58,226
You try to do something good,
but something bad happens, too.

1500
01:29:58,326 --> 01:30:02,465
WILLIAM BROHNER: But you
intend to kill people.

1501
01:30:02,565 --> 01:30:04,633
I choose people who
deserve to be harmed.

1502
01:30:07,603 --> 01:30:09,271
You figure it out yet?

1503
01:30:09,371 --> 01:30:10,739
The ending?

1504
01:30:10,839 --> 01:30:12,274
How it ends for me?

1505
01:30:12,374 --> 01:30:13,442
WILLIAM BROHNER:
How would I know?

1506
01:30:13,542 --> 01:30:16,211
It's your story, not mine.

1507
01:30:16,311 --> 01:30:17,513
So you're not a
chicken plucker?

1508
01:30:20,282 --> 01:30:23,385
Why not bring
reality into focus?

1509
01:30:23,486 --> 01:30:25,788
WILLIAM BROHNER: What
are you talking about?

1510
01:30:25,888 --> 01:30:28,824
What reality into focus?

1511
01:30:28,924 --> 01:30:29,625
This one.

1512
01:30:29,725 --> 01:30:31,226
A day in the death.
