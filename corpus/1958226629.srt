1
00:02:11,278 --> 00:02:14,204
Police believe two men and
three women became the latest

2
00:02:14,229 --> 00:02:16,534
victims of the recent rafts
of mysterious kidnappings

3
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:20,033
when they vanished from the parking lot of
the Good Sports health club late last night.

4
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:24,032
Bringing the number of disappearances
over the last month to a total of 23

5
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:26,034
14 men and 9 women.

6
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:28,587
As with all previous
disappearances the victims were

7
00:02:28,612 --> 00:02:31,635
last seen either going to or
coming from their usual workout.

8
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,111
See you later.
- Bye

9
00:02:33,347 --> 00:02:34,967
Catch you later.
- Bye.

10
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:09,489
In the mean time people are urged to
use their gyms only during daylight hours.

11
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:13,602
If you must go at night travel
in groups and carry big sticks.

12
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:17,000
Hey, I was watching that.

13
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,479
Hi, Kathy. How's it going?

14
00:03:55,575 --> 00:03:57,376
Barbara, I thought you quit.

15
00:03:57,485 --> 00:03:59,360
When I finally looked so good, no way.

16
00:03:59,434 --> 00:04:00,954
I've just been coming in the mornings.

17
00:04:00,993 --> 00:04:02,063
I know what you mean.

18
00:04:02,114 --> 00:04:05,113
I usually try to get out of
here before dark myself.

19
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:10,747
Well, keep it up once you've
been at it as long as I have.

20
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,152
You'll really look good.

21
00:04:13,404 --> 00:04:14,070
Thanks.

22
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,000
You're an inspiration.

23
00:07:57,474 --> 00:08:01,000
Stop it. Mom, Chris keeps
making dinosaur noises at me.

24
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:04,754
- Christine, stop making dinosaurs
sounds at the breakfast table, please.

25
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:06,792
- You started it.
- Did not.

26
00:08:06,847 --> 00:08:08,542
- Did too!
- Did not!

27
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,572
- Did too!
- Did not!

28
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,382
- Mrs. Powell's cat put in our yard again.

29
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,096
- Yeah, well, he did up here.

30
00:08:17,282 --> 00:08:19,429
- Ew, that's a daddy job.

31
00:08:20,444 --> 00:08:23,311
- You know, Dad, if we had a
dog, he'd keep that cat away.

32
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,141
- Yeah, but then I'd be cleaning
up a dog poop instead of cat poop.

33
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:29,000
- If Chris gets a dog, I
want a mouse, a white one.

34
00:08:29,617 --> 00:08:32,967
- Nobody's getting a mouse or a
dog, and I'll take care of that cat myself.

35
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:35,286
- Oh, yeah? How are you gonna do that?

36
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:38,000
- Daddy, you wouldn't!

37
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,000
- Of course he wouldn't.

38
00:08:40,001 --> 00:08:41,000
- Would you honey?

39
00:08:41,001 --> 00:08:42,001
- I don't know.

40
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:48,000
- Yeah.

41
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,000
What's the body count?

42
00:08:53,306 --> 00:08:55,000
- OK, gimme that address.

43
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,153
- Here he is!

44
00:09:26,082 --> 00:09:27,676
- I understand we have a witness?

45
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,462
- Yes, sir.

46
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,347
Security guard found
her hiding in a locker.

47
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:31,534
- Where is she now?

48
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:33,667
- County Memorial under heavy sedation.

49
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,591
- Before I could question her,
whose bright idea was that?

50
00:09:36,794 --> 00:09:37,794
- Lieutenant Wisnowski.

51
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,020
- Shit. What the hell was he doing here?

52
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,382
- I don't know.

53
00:09:45,058 --> 00:09:46,433
- Is Yamata here yet?

54
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:47,946
- Women's locker room.

55
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,000
- Thank you.

56
00:09:55,503 --> 00:09:56,323
- How you doing, Trev?

57
00:09:56,437 --> 00:09:58,429
- Hey, Sully. What a mess, huh?

58
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,451
- Oh, boy.

59
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,044
- Hey, Sully, what's happening?

60
00:10:10,284 --> 00:10:11,877
- I don't know. You tell me.

61
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,531
- We've got one Kathy Carpenter.

62
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:18,000
- Best damn body I've ever seen.

63
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
- Dead or alive?

64
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:20,705
- I got one.

65
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:22,000
- Purse is in that locker.

66
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:22,851
- Anything in it?

67
00:10:22,907 --> 00:10:26,246
- Just the usual compact
lipstick, hairbrush.

68
00:10:26,318 --> 00:10:27,346
- Condoms.

69
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
- You're kind of girl.

70
00:10:29,001 --> 00:10:30,001
- Why, 'cause she's easy?

71
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:32,000
- No, cause she's dead.

72
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,232
- Oh, that's funny.

73
00:10:36,601 --> 00:10:37,892
- So what about the others?

74
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:42,099
- Well, my professional
medical opinion, they're dead too.

75
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,000
- Looks like he used a 22.

76
00:10:50,314 --> 00:10:52,000
- Yeah, that would be my guess.

77
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:54,000
All the wounds were small and clean.

78
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,000
- And all headshots, right?

79
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,500
- Yeah.

80
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,867
- You better hope you never
have to shoot it out with this guy.

81
00:11:02,075 --> 00:11:03,315
I hear he took a few with him.

82
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:05,000
- Yeah, about a half dozen or so.

83
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:07,000
- Jesus Christ.

84
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:12,000
- Well, at least he knows
I'm taking him alive.

85
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,120
- What the hell is he doing with them?

86
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,210
- You're gonna get this guy.
He left tracks this time.

87
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,361
I don't know, Phil.
It's gonna be hard to...

88
00:11:23,286 --> 00:11:24,699
You know that guy?

89
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:27,517
- What guy? - What you didn't see him?

90
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:30,344
- No, he's probably one
of the guys from uptown.

91
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:33,324
- Yeah, maybe.

92
00:11:58,753 --> 00:11:59,882
- First of the month.

93
00:13:21,986 --> 00:13:23,419
- Hey, Wyznowski

94
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:26,893
What's the deal with
you sending my witness to

95
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,717
the hospital before I
could even question her?

96
00:13:28,859 --> 00:13:30,392
- I tried talking to her.

97
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,516
It's a fucking waste of time.
Just keeps blubbering.

98
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,993
- Uh-huh. Well, next time
you should try a more sensitive

99
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:38,017
approach, like, uh, beating
her with a rubber hose.

100
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,244
- Hello, Phil.

101
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,798
Hey Sully, my dog just had puppies.
What do you say?

102
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,591
- Wear a condom next time.

103
00:13:57,861 --> 00:13:59,954
- I thought you just
might want one for the kids.

104
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,533
- Smart ass.
- No, thank you.

105
00:14:06,076 --> 00:14:08,235
- Come on, Sully, every kid needs a dog.

106
00:14:08,475 --> 00:14:10,435
- What to piss on my carpet
and chew on my shoes?

107
00:14:10,461 --> 00:14:12,956
- Uh-huh.
You just described my date last night.

108
00:14:13,256 --> 00:14:15,469
You got to start going out with
a better class of a woman, Phil.

109
00:14:15,493 --> 00:14:17,933
- All right. Tell your sister I can't
see her anymore then.

110
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:21,636
- Can't, we don't talk.
- Now Medina says

111
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:24,000
that you haven't send over
the bullets to ballistics.

112
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,270
- How come?
- There aren't any.

113
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,000
- What are you talking about?

114
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
- He must have dug
them out before he took off.

115
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,162
- Dug them out of the corpses.
- Yeah.

116
00:14:34,521 --> 00:14:35,947
And they weren't just
regular headshots, either.

117
00:14:35,971 --> 00:14:38,970
He shot him either in the ear or the eye.

118
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,385
- Holy shit.
- What?

119
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,007
- Well, I had this friend once,
Kevin, something and, uh,

120
00:14:46,525 --> 00:14:49,399
he used to stuff animals as a hobby, and
he'd always had to shoot them in the eyes

121
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:50,977
so there wouldn't be any
bullet holes in the hide.

122
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:52,224
You know what I mean?

123
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,060
- You think our boys got a trophy room?

124
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:57,006
- Sullivan, Yamada... Wyznowski

125
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,322
My office, please.

126
00:15:07,714 --> 00:15:11,920
Gentlemen, I just got off the phone with
the chief, and my ears are still ringing.

127
00:15:12,762 --> 00:15:13,912
So give me some good news.

128
00:15:13,953 --> 00:15:17,000
I wish we could captain, but our
boy covers his tracks pretty damn well.

129
00:15:17,831 --> 00:15:20,368
We don't know dick,
except that he's a dead shot,

130
00:15:20,393 --> 00:15:22,233
and he's very discriminating
about his victims.

131
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:26,493
- Let me have that with you. - Sure.

132
00:15:27,973 --> 00:15:30,583
- So, uh, you don't agree, huh?
- No, sir, I don't.

133
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:33,396
I got that these guys are
generally discriminating,

134
00:15:33,821 --> 00:15:37,820
you know, zeroing in on a specific race or
gender, but this guy is all over the map.

135
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:43,446
He'll hit men, women,
black, white, spics, chinks,

136
00:15:43,713 --> 00:15:46,446
- Hey
- I mean oriental people, sir.

137
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:50,471
The only constant thing,
sir, is where he kills them.

138
00:15:51,073 --> 00:15:52,166
And that's in health spas.

139
00:15:52,204 --> 00:15:56,133
No, if they're the wrong size, he leaves
them behind, neither too heavy or too thin.

140
00:15:56,175 --> 00:15:59,386
Our boy wants people in
perfect physical condition.

141
00:15:59,866 --> 00:16:02,000
So, why did he leave
the weightlifter behind?

142
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,529
Or that perfect ten in the shower?

143
00:16:04,669 --> 00:16:06,590
I don't know, but there is a reason.

144
00:16:07,073 --> 00:16:09,430
You bet there's a reason.
The reason is you're wrong.

145
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,505
Well, you look at this, am I
giving this too much water, or..?

146
00:16:13,863 --> 00:16:15,596
Maybe there's not enough sunlight.

147
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,751
Yamada, what do you think?

148
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:22,977
Well, um, I'm no expert, but have
you tried those little fertilizer steaks?

149
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:26,057
Oh, no, no. I mean, what do
you think about Sullivan's theory?

150
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:28,657
Oh, I think it makes sense.

151
00:16:29,237 --> 00:16:30,928
I mean, I don't know
what our boys do with the

152
00:16:30,952 --> 00:16:33,494
bodies, but he does want
him in perfect condition.

153
00:16:33,991 --> 00:16:35,751
You only saying that,
because you like him.

154
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:39,085
No, I'm only saying that
because I don't like you.

155
00:16:40,391 --> 00:16:42,205
You see, sir, that's
what I was telling you.

156
00:16:42,525 --> 00:16:45,031
These guys are constantly
talking about me like that

157
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:47,735
in front of the man of that
undermines my authority.

158
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:50,487
The only thing undermining
your authority is that suit.

159
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:51,634
And the tie.

160
00:16:51,774 --> 00:16:52,883
Well, yeah, the tie goes that same.

161
00:16:52,907 --> 00:16:54,913
Oh, right.
Look, that's enough, okay?

162
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:57,764
Now, tell me about the witness.
You got a statement yet?

163
00:16:57,924 --> 00:17:00,592
She's on a sedation and will
be unconscious until morning.

164
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:03,336
All right. I want
Wisnowski and you to be

165
00:17:03,364 --> 00:17:05,363
the first things she
sees when she wakes up.

166
00:17:06,301 --> 00:17:07,301
And Wisnowski.

167
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,065
Try getting a little closer
to your razor tomorrow.

168
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:15,943
I should have said there was a memo from my
dermatologist about the rash on my face.

169
00:17:16,781 --> 00:17:19,780
Yeah, well, you got till the weekend, okay?

170
00:17:20,153 --> 00:17:22,335
Now, everybody get out of here, will ya.

171
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:24,122
I'm going to figure
out what I'm going to

172
00:17:24,146 --> 00:17:25,996
have to say to the
press conference tonight.

173
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,000
Puppies make great Christmas presents.
- Fuck you, Phil.

174
00:17:33,336 --> 00:17:35,048
I just wanted to throw that out there.

175
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,675
Thanks for your support, guys.

176
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,023
Hey, it's a jungle in there.

177
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Is it just me or is he fat?

178
00:18:08,687 --> 00:18:09,932
Bye, Amy.
- Bye!

179
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Bye.

180
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:04,743
Yeah, Lieutenant Sullivan.

181
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,767
Hey stranger, I'm heading home.

182
00:19:06,795 --> 00:19:09,456
Should I keep it warm or
are you going to be late again?

183
00:19:10,048 --> 00:19:11,673
Keep what warm, honey?

184
00:19:12,737 --> 00:19:14,010
Dinner, of course.

185
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,649
You're such a tease.

186
00:19:16,674 --> 00:19:18,067
Look, I was just about...

187
00:19:25,342 --> 00:19:26,295
Honey, I'll call you back.

188
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,501
I got to go, OK?

189
00:19:28,621 --> 00:19:29,621
Oh, OK.

190
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,212
Love you.

191
00:19:31,261 --> 00:19:32,261
I love you, too.

192
00:19:47,913 --> 00:19:49,367
Hey, Sully.

193
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,324
Caught me in the middle of dinner.

194
00:19:51,348 --> 00:19:52,147
Christ Phil,

195
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,521
how can you eat in here?

196
00:19:53,923 --> 00:19:55,873
You've never eaten in the cafeteria.

197
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:56,937
What's up?

198
00:19:57,117 --> 00:20:00,013
The weightlifter and the dead
woman in the shower.

199
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:01,581
I haven't gotten to them yet.

200
00:20:01,714 --> 00:20:03,201
Good, let's check them out.

201
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:05,313
You mind telling me
what you're looking for?

202
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:06,673
Scars.

203
00:20:07,734 --> 00:20:09,103
Like this one.

204
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,322
Appendectomy.

205
00:20:13,965 --> 00:20:15,248
Speaking of scars.

206
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:20,248
Did you ever find out what caused
that rash on eh, Wisnovski's face?

207
00:20:20,574 --> 00:20:22,388
Could be the stress of the case.

208
00:20:22,627 --> 00:20:26,561
It either that or he's had his head up his
ass so long he finally caught something.

209
00:20:28,068 --> 00:20:29,128
No scars.

210
00:20:29,441 --> 00:20:30,441
Can I turn her over?

211
00:20:30,977 --> 00:20:32,064
Lift up her arm.

212
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,879
Oh, yeah.
- Implants.

213
00:20:36,314 --> 00:20:37,653
Primo piece of work too.

214
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:38,266
Mm-hmm.

215
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,946
Must have spend 15 grand.

216
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,166
A piece?

217
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,539
No.

218
00:20:42,564 --> 00:20:44,563
You've got to buy him in pairs like shoes.

219
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,607
You're developing a nice pair there, Phil.

220
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,626
What is that on your neck?

221
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:52,053
Is that... a hickey?

222
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,588
No, it's a birthmark.

223
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:56,675
Mm-hmm. Sure whatever you say, Phil

224
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,000
So how'd you know about the scars?

225
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,852
A Missing Persons file.

226
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,124
All 20 of the original victims
had no distinguishing scars.

227
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,540
So do we have a taxidermist here?

228
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,680
You think he's mounting trophies?

229
00:21:10,468 --> 00:21:11,267
No, Phil.

230
00:21:11,292 --> 00:21:13,291
I don't know what to think.

231
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,724
This is a loss.

232
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,490
Hi, baby.

233
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,070
Hi, baby.

234
00:21:31,361 --> 00:21:32,361
What's up?

235
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,000
Ah, just grading papers.

236
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:39,000
Miss Azbel's out with a flu, so I'm
handling her third graders for a few days.

237
00:21:39,744 --> 00:21:40,744
Christ.

238
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,464
2 a.m.

239
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,544
I was waiting up for you.

240
00:21:45,001 --> 00:21:47,000
Why what's up?

241
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,278
Well, I took the kids to your mother's.

242
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,424
Mm-hmm. Everybody okay?

243
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:52,467
Everything's fine.

244
00:21:52,801 --> 00:21:54,800
I just took them to your mother's.

245
00:21:54,893 --> 00:21:55,893
Is that a fact?

246
00:21:56,313 --> 00:22:00,312
Well, I just thought maybe
we could have some time alone.

247
00:22:01,526 --> 00:22:02,675
You tired?

248
00:22:03,306 --> 00:22:04,868
Well, actually, yeah.

249
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:08,781
How tired?

250
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:11,939
Well... tired, tired.

251
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,399
Okay.

252
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,593
I said I was tired.

253
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,210
Not dead.

254
00:22:46,314 --> 00:22:48,487
I think I just felt the eh... Earth move.

255
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,247
Maybe we should
continue this upstairs, huh?

256
00:22:51,674 --> 00:22:55,244
Okay, well, you go
upstairs and I'll clean this up.

257
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:58,138
You've got to be kidding me.

258
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,780
Mrs Brewster.

259
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:11,000
I'm Lieutenant Sullivan, and this is
lieutenant Wyznowski.

260
00:23:11,001 --> 00:23:13,648
Yeah, we'll be, uh,
serial killer task force.

261
00:23:13,885 --> 00:23:15,718
But I already told the other officer.

262
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:17,866
I didn't see anything
when I heard the gunshot.

263
00:23:18,025 --> 00:23:19,232
I hid in my locker.

264
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
Other officer?

265
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,986
The one who was just here?

266
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:24,206
You just missed him.

267
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,335
Excuse me!

268
00:23:37,741 --> 00:23:38,888
Stay.

269
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,050
Stay?

270
00:23:42,703 --> 00:23:44,653
What the fuck is that?

271
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:54,823
Out of the way!

272
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,608
Out of the way, police!

273
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,633
Go away!

274
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,092
Get out of the way!

275
00:25:32,034 --> 00:25:32,767
Hey!

276
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:33,797
He didn't go that way!

277
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:35,028
Trust me!

278
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,233
Hey, Wyznowski you alright?

279
00:26:08,529 --> 00:26:10,126
God damn it!

280
00:26:10,421 --> 00:26:11,215
Let's go!

281
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:12,246
Best damn jacket!

282
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,089
New this week!

283
00:26:15,201 --> 00:26:16,850
God damn it!

284
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:23,971
God!

285
00:26:35,726 --> 00:26:36,850
You lost him!

286
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:39,150
Great!

287
00:26:41,001 --> 00:26:42,001
Ah, come on!

288
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:43,966
Let's put out an APB.

289
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:30,726
I didn't know where you were hiding,
but I knew you'd have to come back out.

290
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,039
You got him!

291
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:51,182
Is he dead?

292
00:27:51,502 --> 00:27:54,238
Well I'd put three
rounds through this punk.

293
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:58,082
Yeah well, will generally do it.

294
00:28:09,503 --> 00:28:11,106
I thought you said you shot him.

295
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,108
Okay, I can't just hear myself, folks.

296
00:28:36,001 --> 00:28:37,507
You know, as much as I do.

297
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:41,264
You know weirdo, you
starting to get on my nerves.

298
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:47,552
At least tell us where those bodies are so
families can give them a proper burial.

299
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,618
You better start talking shit face.

300
00:28:52,093 --> 00:28:55,245
Or I'm gonna give
you a 9-millimeter enema.

301
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,181
I don't see a lawyer in there.

302
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:17,791
Has he been Mirandized?

303
00:29:18,001 --> 00:29:19,001
Yes, he has.

304
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,726
But he hasn't spoken since he came, too.

305
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,749
I'm not even sure he speaks English.

306
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:25,000
What is that smell?

307
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,976
I'm sorry, sir.
I fell into the trash can.

308
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:32,469
Oh, good.

309
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,604
Good. I was afraid I was over-fertilizing.

310
00:29:37,268 --> 00:29:38,639
Did he have any id on him?

311
00:29:38,853 --> 00:29:39,853
No id.

312
00:29:40,099 --> 00:29:42,933
He had stun gun, sunglasses,
a watch, and a key.

313
00:29:42,973 --> 00:29:44,874
Probably to his
apartment, wherever that is.

314
00:29:45,101 --> 00:29:46,427
What about his fingerprints?

315
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,814
You ran them through the FBI?

316
00:29:47,875 --> 00:29:49,689
No, Prints. His fingers were smooth.

317
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:50,569
As a baby's butt.

318
00:29:50,649 --> 00:29:51,649
What do you mean?

319
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,509
He took them off with acid or something.

320
00:29:55,395 --> 00:29:57,366
You find that unusual? Take a look at this.

321
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,166
Ah, Medina, what's a matter with you, man?

322
00:29:59,191 --> 00:30:00,822
The question is, what's
the matter with him?

323
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:03,658
You claim this device rendered
him unconscious, correct?

324
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Yeah.

325
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,391
Well, this was modified
to only transmit 10 volts,

326
00:30:07,713 --> 00:30:09,953
This contraption wouldn't
have stun a laboratory rat

327
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,010
It's probably why it wouldn't stun you.

328
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,940
I know, you gotta check out the jacket.

329
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,000
I think it's bulletproof.

330
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,553
Why don't you just admit you missed?

331
00:30:17,638 --> 00:30:19,819
It's the jacket. It isn't even scorched.

332
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,681
Well, perhaps inside.

333
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:25,328
It's chemically treated or...
Synthetically woven or something.

334
00:30:25,435 --> 00:30:27,608
Yeah, perhaps I'm Miss America.

335
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,107
Listen, why don't you take a bath, huh?

336
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:35,462
And let's just see if we can't find out who
this guy is before the awards ceremony.

337
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:39,350
Awards ceremony?

338
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:41,143
I'm getting an award.

339
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:52,000
Last night, the city slept a little easier

340
00:30:52,001 --> 00:30:55,000
because the alleged health spot
killer spent the night behind bars.

341
00:30:55,118 --> 00:30:58,530
Lieutenant Mike Sullivan
of the serial killer task force,

342
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,105
who apprehended the suspect
after a harrowing foot chase,

343
00:31:01,178 --> 00:31:02,808
was presented with a special commendation.

344
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:03,832
My hero.

345
00:31:05,512 --> 00:31:07,338
You talk about me like
I'm some kind of Rambo.

346
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:09,305
Lucky me, yeah.

347
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,977
Well, if you play your cards, right?

348
00:31:11,001 --> 00:31:12,198
You might get lucky again.

349
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:13,334
Oh, yeah?

350
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,438
Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

351
00:31:15,587 --> 00:31:16,587
Yeah?

352
00:31:16,612 --> 00:31:17,298
Mm-hmm.

353
00:31:17,401 --> 00:31:18,401
- Mm-hmm.

354
00:31:28,044 --> 00:31:29,044
Yeah?

355
00:31:32,001 --> 00:31:34,000
Mm-hmm.

356
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:36,933
OH baby.

357
00:31:42,146 --> 00:31:43,380
Tada!

358
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:45,833
What is that?

359
00:31:45,867 --> 00:31:47,540
Daddy's a hero!

360
00:31:47,585 --> 00:31:49,933
Yeah, so we made you breakfast in bed.

361
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:52,204
Wow, ain't this is great, honey?

362
00:31:52,254 --> 00:31:53,254
Yeah, this is great.

363
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:55,340
Uh, thanks, guys.

364
00:31:56,001 --> 00:31:57,000
Thanks, guys.

365
00:31:57,001 --> 00:31:57,622
Dad?

366
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:58,355
It's for you.

367
00:31:58,393 --> 00:31:58,962
Yes?

368
00:31:59,114 --> 00:32:02,113
If Superman and Mighty Mouse
had a fight, who would win?

369
00:32:02,261 --> 00:32:04,260
Yeah, dad, who?

370
00:32:04,727 --> 00:32:07,301
Well, I think that's a mommy question.

371
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:09,821
I mean, mommy gets a teacher, right?

372
00:32:10,098 --> 00:32:11,873
But she told us to ask you.

373
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:14,000
Really?

374
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,289
Superhero falls into
daddy questions category.

375
00:32:16,427 --> 00:32:17,269
Is that a fact?

376
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:17,742
Mm-hmm.

377
00:32:17,807 --> 00:32:18,322
Okay.

378
00:32:18,372 --> 00:32:21,702
Well, um, Superman is a person.

379
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,879
And Mighty Mouse isn't a person.

380
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,681
And people are smarter than animals.

381
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:29,321
Well, lab mice have proven to
be very intelligent, sweetheart.

382
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,372
Really?

383
00:32:30,457 --> 00:32:31,253
They're smart?

384
00:32:31,381 --> 00:32:32,987
But they're not as smart as people.

385
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,566
So Superman would win then?

386
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:35,753
Absolutely.

387
00:32:35,794 --> 00:32:39,388
But Mighty Mouse could fly right up
Superman's butt, and rip his heart out.

388
00:32:39,716 --> 00:32:41,925
Kathleen Sullivan, you
know better than that.

389
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:43,825
He couldn't fly up Superman's butt?

390
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
No stupid.

391
00:32:45,271 --> 00:32:48,246
Superman can just squeeze his
ass cheeks together and squish him.

392
00:32:50,472 --> 00:32:51,761
You think this is funny?

393
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:53,595
No, no, no.

394
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,035
You two, where you get language like that.

395
00:33:01,701 --> 00:33:03,268
Ah!
Honey look at the time.

396
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:04,595
I've got to go.

397
00:33:06,703 --> 00:33:08,288
Mommy, daddy's a hero.

398
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:10,326
Isn't he just like Superman?

399
00:33:10,587 --> 00:33:12,207
Oh, yeah, he certainly is.

400
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:13,534
Definitely.

401
00:33:14,681 --> 00:33:16,680
But it hasn't been treated with chemicals.

402
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:17,746
Are you sure?

403
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:20,112
Sully, I did my undergraduate
studies in the 70s.

404
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:21,207
I know my chemicals.

405
00:33:21,554 --> 00:33:23,234
So you're saying this is not real leather?

406
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,167
No, no, it, uh, most definitely is real.

407
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:29,000
I just can't seem to
place the exact species.

408
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:31,030
It's probably some kind of crocodile.

409
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,645
Medina, crocodile is not bulletproof.

410
00:33:33,801 --> 00:33:37,547
Sully, if you brought me a
dodo skin jacket to examine,

411
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,200
for example, I would
be able to place it either.

412
00:33:40,474 --> 00:33:42,634
Well, wouldn't have anything
to actually compare it to.

413
00:33:42,806 --> 00:33:44,359
I mean, we know the dodo bird existed.

414
00:33:44,384 --> 00:33:47,500
We even know what it looked like, but,
um, we don't have an actual specimen.

415
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,562
Just a head and a foot at
the British Museum in London.

416
00:33:50,747 --> 00:33:52,807
So you're telling me
this animal is extinct?

417
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,301
It's at least an endangered species.

418
00:33:57,001 --> 00:34:00,654
It's probably from Africa,
most likely from Egypt.

419
00:34:01,150 --> 00:34:02,333
What a waste.

420
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:03,900
Don't worry, buddy.

421
00:34:04,106 --> 00:34:06,906
Our perpetrator is killing humans now.

422
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,000
Sullivan.

423
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:30,833
Morning.

424
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,357
Captain.

425
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:40,339
Wyznowski is taking
over the task force.

426
00:34:40,983 --> 00:34:43,237
Another health spot
was hit late last night.

427
00:34:43,576 --> 00:34:45,426
Now the press hasn't gotten hold of it yet.

428
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:48,847
But when they do, they're gonna tear
Chief Dawes and the Mayor new assholes.

429
00:34:48,873 --> 00:34:49,873
Oh, my God.

430
00:34:49,961 --> 00:34:51,173
You got the wrong guy.

431
00:34:52,083 --> 00:34:54,963
Now we're gonna have to cut him
loose so he doesn't sue for false arrest.

432
00:34:55,001 --> 00:34:56,700
False arrest?

433
00:34:56,836 --> 00:34:58,786
Well, there's nothing to hold him on.

434
00:34:58,811 --> 00:35:00,491
What about impersonating a police officer?

435
00:35:00,879 --> 00:35:04,189
The witness at the hospital said
that she only assumed he was a cop.

436
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,150
But he never actually flashed a badge.

437
00:35:06,175 --> 00:35:07,677
Well, let's hold him resisting arrest.

438
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:10,700
Wyznowski tells me that you
never identified yourself as a cop.

439
00:35:11,066 --> 00:35:13,539
Seems like pretty sloppy police work to me.

440
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,199
You can't let him go, Captain.

441
00:35:15,267 --> 00:35:16,406
He's involved, I know it.

442
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,399
I love seeing you on your knees, Sullivan.

443
00:35:19,196 --> 00:35:20,714
So does your wife.

444
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:21,976
You.

445
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:23,001
Hey, hey, hey.

446
00:35:23,407 --> 00:35:24,407
No yelling.

447
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,849
It's bad for morale.

448
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,354
There's nothing wrong with my morale.

449
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,336
Not yours, the plants.

450
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,886
And get the fuck off my wandering Jew.

451
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:36,619
Sullivan, I'm sorry.

452
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:39,619
Hey,
do the words earlier retirement

453
00:35:39,646 --> 00:35:40,793
mean anything to you.

454
00:35:42,552 --> 00:35:44,501
Do the words blow me,
mean anything to you?

455
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:02,693
Lieutenant Sullivan!

456
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:05,643
Sully, it's Phil, I got something for you.

457
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,150
So what does that look like to you?

458
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:15,000
I don't know.

459
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,228
Looks like a tracking beacon.

460
00:36:17,607 --> 00:36:19,528
But I never seen one this small.

461
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,321
It was on this guy.

462
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:23,966
No, in him.

463
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,468
Upper vertebra right here.

464
00:36:27,001 --> 00:36:28,001
Wow.

465
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:30,462
Why?

466
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,001
Why?

467
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:34,000
I can't even tell you how.

468
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:37,000
I mean, there's not a surgical
scar anywhere on this guy.

469
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,000
Why would anybody want
to track a CPA anyway?

470
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,950
I don't know.

471
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,449
But I'm going to find out.

472
00:36:48,001 --> 00:36:49,001
Wow.

473
00:40:07,595 --> 00:40:10,288
The HANGAR gentlemen's club
Live NUDE girls

474
00:40:14,928 --> 00:40:17,613
Good evening, there's a
20 dollar cover charge...

475
00:40:17,796 --> 00:40:19,047
Oh shit!

476
00:41:30,793 --> 00:41:32,860
Hi, what'll you have?

477
00:42:28,023 --> 00:42:29,731
What is this guy? A vampire?

478
00:43:04,908 --> 00:43:06,075
Whoa.

479
00:43:24,547 --> 00:43:25,547
Holy shit!

480
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:52,459
9-1-1 state the nature of your emergency.

481
00:43:55,903 --> 00:43:58,976
All units in the vicinity of
Mannheim and Foster proceed

482
00:43:59,001 --> 00:44:02,797
to the Hangar gentlemen's club,
possible sighting of the health nut.

483
00:45:07,764 --> 00:45:10,439
This is the Police, throw
down your weapon..

484
00:45:14,262 --> 00:45:16,654
This is the Police, throw
down your weapon and

485
00:45:16,678 --> 00:45:19,069
come out with your hands
away from your body.

486
00:47:02,976 --> 00:47:05,580
Unit 5 joining pursuit of the health nut.

487
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:09,042
Be advised suspect is turning
towards Memorial parkway

488
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:22,900
Move it pal, catch up!

489
00:47:33,064 --> 00:47:34,990
Swinging around to cut him off.

490
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:41,671
Damn it, I'm boxed in

491
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:52,981
Can you cut him off, unit 5?

492
00:47:53,456 --> 00:47:56,356
Negative, there are too
many civilian vehicles

493
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:59,673
Dispatch, where the hell is our backup?

494
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:04,003
Unit 12 and 7 are responding, but
their ETA is aproximately 5 minutes

495
00:48:15,469 --> 00:48:18,205
Go to flank, cut
him off again unit 5

496
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:21,629
See if you can perform a hit
manoevre that forces him to slow down

497
00:48:35,477 --> 00:48:36,740
Mother

498
00:50:13,714 --> 00:50:15,574
What the fuck?
Let's go.

499
00:50:39,694 --> 00:50:41,502
Holy shit, is that a gun?

500
00:50:42,001 --> 00:50:43,610
There he goes, onto the highway.

501
00:50:43,653 --> 00:50:45,652
Get me close enough
so I can shoot out his tires.

502
00:50:48,563 --> 00:50:50,123
You can't even see his tires.

503
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:51,447
Yes, I can.

504
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:56,093
Oh, yeah.

505
00:51:04,154 --> 00:51:07,134
Oh, yeah. This is wild.

506
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:26,706
That's it. That's it.
Now hold steady so I can get a clean shot.

507
00:51:34,428 --> 00:51:37,208
Oh, Christ, he's got a fucking Cannon.

508
00:51:43,053 --> 00:51:44,540
Faster, he's getting away.

509
00:51:44,594 --> 00:51:46,593
I'll do the driving, you do the shooting.

510
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:48,846
Catch up so I can get
another shot of his tires.

511
00:51:48,977 --> 00:51:50,983
Fuck his tires, kill him.

512
00:51:52,001 --> 00:51:55,000
I can't.
You can try harder.

513
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:15,272
Remember, I want him alive.

514
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,540
Holy shit.

515
00:53:11,814 --> 00:53:14,244
I thought you said you
couldn't kill that son of a bitch.

516
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,507
I can't.

517
00:53:17,377 --> 00:53:18,377
Can't?

518
00:53:20,693 --> 00:53:22,054
Or wont?

519
00:53:29,238 --> 00:53:33,011
Stay. Don't talk to me
like your puppy, all right?

520
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:11,740
- Jental!

521
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:18,285
Depos su armoey.

522
00:54:20,753 --> 00:54:22,836
- Shoot him! Shoot him!!

523
00:54:25,192 --> 00:54:26,733
For Christ sake, shoot him!

524
00:54:46,808 --> 00:54:48,658
- Sayonara, son of a bitch.

525
00:55:40,618 --> 00:55:42,000
- All clear.

526
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:48,000
- He's already gone.

527
00:55:49,250 --> 00:55:51,000
Nobody packs up that fast.

528
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:55,762
- Are you sure this is the right place?

529
00:56:01,282 --> 00:56:03,312
- Sullivan, what are you doing?

530
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,000
- I'm looking for something.

531
00:56:06,381 --> 00:56:07,381
- By Braille?

532
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:14,187
- But there's nothing here, come on.

533
00:56:19,554 --> 00:56:21,314
- That fuck bitch

534
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,859
- Ah, Yamada, I'm glad you could make it.

535
00:56:37,085 --> 00:56:37,876
- Sorry.

536
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:40,625
- Getting through those reporters
is like parting the Red Sea.

537
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,616
- All right, here's what we have so far.

538
00:56:44,296 --> 00:56:46,347
A perp has changed his MO,

539
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:50,534
Probably because every health
club in this city is now closing at dusk.

540
00:56:50,734 --> 00:56:53,607
And he's left behind every
stripper with augmented breasts.

541
00:56:54,034 --> 00:56:55,660
- Is there any other kind?

542
00:56:56,087 --> 00:56:58,330
- Well, the three left on
the cart, we're all natural.

543
00:56:58,763 --> 00:57:00,643
Sully says that our original suspect

544
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:02,878
actually helped him pursue the health nut.

545
00:57:03,331 --> 00:57:05,044
That he may be a cop from another country,

546
00:57:05,191 --> 00:57:07,621
and that the health nut is
maybe from the same place.

547
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,797
- What are you saying they're both aliens?

548
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:11,000
- Definitely.

549
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:12,814
- From where? Europe?

550
00:57:13,154 --> 00:57:14,154
- Europe?

551
00:57:14,825 --> 00:57:17,208
- That might explain
the exotic leather jacket,

552
00:57:17,282 --> 00:57:20,168
but I mean, who manufactured
those sophisticated weapons?

553
00:57:20,302 --> 00:57:21,562
- Yeah, now, what about those?

554
00:57:21,795 --> 00:57:23,562
- I've never seen
anything like them before.

555
00:57:23,988 --> 00:57:27,691
- All right, I want every hospital
in a 200 mile radius checked out.

556
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,245
If our boy doesn't get
himself some medical

557
00:57:30,278 --> 00:57:33,578
attention, he's gonna take
care of our problem for us.

558
00:57:34,551 --> 00:57:38,443
- Now, Yamada, I want you to take the perp's
arm back to the morgue, keep it on ice.

559
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:40,516
- You guys get prints off of it yet?

560
00:57:40,696 --> 00:57:41,861
- Has no fingerprints.

561
00:57:41,971 --> 00:57:43,567
- Oh, deja vu.

562
00:57:43,933 --> 00:57:45,000
- I don't get it.

563
00:57:46,174 --> 00:57:50,934
If this guy was a cop, why didn't he
tell us when we had him in custody?

564
00:57:51,307 --> 00:57:52,509
- Maybe he's under cover.

565
00:57:52,735 --> 00:57:54,495
- Well, what have to
be a fucking deep cover?

566
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:57,406
- So maybe it's a fucking deep
cover, what the hell you want from me.

567
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,633
- Well, that one from
you was the fucking truth.

568
00:58:07,001 --> 00:58:08,213
- The fucking truth!

569
00:58:08,373 --> 00:58:09,373
- What are you saying?

570
00:58:09,956 --> 00:58:11,315
That I'm holding evidence?

571
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:13,000
- Well, you said it. Not me.

572
00:58:13,825 --> 00:58:15,785
- It's because there's
too many syllables for you.

573
00:58:29,107 --> 00:58:30,261
- You alright, Sully?

574
00:58:36,809 --> 00:58:37,809
I need a favor.

575
00:58:38,709 --> 00:58:41,000
I need you to do an
autopsy on that arm for me.

576
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:43,000
I already know what it died of.

577
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,000
Separation anxiety.

578
00:58:47,051 --> 00:58:51,040
- I need you to look for anything
wrong or unusual about that arm.

579
00:58:51,355 --> 00:58:52,641
What's going on?

580
00:58:52,876 --> 00:58:54,061
Was Wyznowski right?

581
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:55,274
Are you hiding something?

582
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:59,007
- Okay, I remember that homing beacon
we found on the CPA.

583
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:00,144
- Yeah.

584
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:04,222
- What if it's sort of a gaming tag like you
put on wild animals to track their migration?

585
00:59:04,367 --> 00:59:05,367
- Are you serious?

586
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:06,992
That's all part of that.

587
00:59:09,139 --> 00:59:10,335
- No, man.

588
00:59:10,987 --> 00:59:12,610
One thing people aren't migratory.

589
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,392
- So were you born here?

590
00:59:15,559 --> 00:59:16,652
- No, Chicago.

591
00:59:17,726 --> 00:59:19,409
But I didn't migrate. I moved.

592
00:59:19,921 --> 00:59:21,235
- And you spend the winters in Florida.

593
00:59:21,259 --> 00:59:22,450
What do you call that?

594
00:59:22,939 --> 00:59:24,039
- Christmas vacation.

595
00:59:24,056 --> 00:59:28,952
Listen, if you want me to help you, you
gonna have to let me know what's going on.

596
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:30,740
- Okay.

597
00:59:33,475 --> 00:59:35,131
This sounds crazy.

598
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,962
But I don't think those guys
are from another country.

599
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:42,166
I think they're from another planet.

600
00:59:43,725 --> 00:59:45,000
Let me guess.

601
00:59:45,001 --> 00:59:46,150
Uranus, right?

602
00:59:46,567 --> 00:59:47,567
- Phil.

603
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,000
The killer was bulletproof.

604
00:59:49,550 --> 00:59:52,000
And that Van disappeared
right in front of me.

605
00:59:52,393 --> 00:59:56,288
It was a dark van on a dimly lit
highway and you can't shoot worth a shit.

606
00:59:56,315 --> 00:59:58,765
I know the difference between
hard to see and invisible.

607
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,560
Maybe you should get that
head when you look that.

608
01:00:01,584 --> 01:00:04,297
Phil, just do the autopsy for me, okay?

609
01:00:05,127 --> 01:00:06,157
Please.

610
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:13,399
All right. Thanks.

611
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:18,352
You're gonna think I'm fucking crazy.

612
01:01:30,553 --> 01:01:35,000
Honey, what do you know about that
woman who did the studies on the apes?

613
01:01:35,350 --> 01:01:37,520
Which one? Dian Fossey or Jane Goodall?

614
01:01:37,836 --> 01:01:38,413
I don't know.

615
01:01:38,594 --> 01:01:40,593
The one who was in the jungle with them.

616
01:01:41,050 --> 01:01:42,740
Well, let's see. There was Dian Fossey,

617
01:01:42,789 --> 01:01:45,639
who spent 20 years with the
mountain gorillas in Rwanda.

618
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:48,000
And then Jane Goodall's been living

619
01:01:48,050 --> 01:01:52,000
with the chimpanzees in
Tanzania for 30 years.

620
01:01:53,139 --> 01:01:54,939
When did you become miss Britannica?

621
01:01:58,050 --> 01:02:00,173
Okay, something's bothering you.
What is it?

622
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:03,000
You know, I hate when you do that.

623
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:07,353
But let's say you're Jane Goodall.

624
01:02:08,053 --> 01:02:10,293
And someone is killing all the chimpanzees.

625
01:02:10,513 --> 01:02:12,160
You'd stop him if you could, right?

626
01:02:12,634 --> 01:02:13,634
If I could.

627
01:02:13,873 --> 01:02:14,873
Would you kill them?

628
01:02:15,201 --> 01:02:16,053
No, of course not.

629
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:17,880
Even if it meant saving all the chimps?

630
01:02:18,166 --> 01:02:22,812
Look, as much as I love animals, and
you know I do, they're still only animals.

631
01:02:23,786 --> 01:02:25,719
You know, Dian Fossey
had that same problem.

632
01:02:26,166 --> 01:02:27,926
Someone was trying to
kill all the gorillas?

633
01:02:27,972 --> 01:02:30,253
Yeah, I mean, she almost got
them until they murdered her.

634
01:02:30,976 --> 01:02:32,295
They murdered her!

635
01:02:34,263 --> 01:02:38,282
So what you're saying is... The
gorillas have to take care of themselves.

636
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:41,623
Right.

637
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:21,006
Lieutenant Sullivan.
- Sully it's Carlos from vehicle impound.

638
01:03:21,350 --> 01:03:22,737
Carlos, what you got for me?

639
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:24,345
Not much, I'm afraid.

640
01:03:24,719 --> 01:03:26,645
That Van is nothing but a burnt-out shell.

641
01:03:26,685 --> 01:03:28,132
Nothing weird about it?

642
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:29,180
Like what?

643
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,819
High-tech, alien-type shit.

644
01:03:32,001 --> 01:03:33,179
It's a Van, Sully

645
01:03:33,261 --> 01:03:34,692
Not the space shuttle.

646
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:37,991
Okay, thanks for calling... Carlos.

647
01:03:44,476 --> 01:03:48,976
This is a bullet from the suspect's smaller
handgun, normal over-under barrel.

648
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,533
What was it? Two-five?

649
01:03:50,739 --> 01:03:53,650
Actually, it's closer
to the caliber to 2.7 and 2.8

650
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,788
Custom jam.

651
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,405
Assuredly so.

652
01:03:57,078 --> 01:03:58,772
As evidenced by this.

653
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:02,246
What the hell is that?

654
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:03,960
Oh, dear!

655
01:04:04,662 --> 01:04:07,797
The closest I can
surmise is a, a gyroscope?

656
01:04:08,407 --> 01:04:11,641
An electronic homing
system of some configuration.

657
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,075
Modified to microscopic
proportions, of course.

658
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:17,051
But, you know, we all know your
college educated, just say it in English.

659
01:04:17,075 --> 01:04:18,921
He means it's a mini guided missile?

660
01:04:18,948 --> 01:04:21,000
That would be my hypothesis.

661
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:24,000
Based on the data and the
physical evidence presented to me.

662
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:26,207
Well, that would explain
all the fancy headshots.

663
01:04:26,232 --> 01:04:27,260
Hey, wait a minute!

664
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:28,240
Wait a minute.

665
01:04:28,265 --> 01:04:29,265
Wait a minute.

666
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:34,809
Are you saying that this bullet is
capable of chasing people down like a...

667
01:04:35,048 --> 01:04:36,745
like a heat-seeking rocket?

668
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:37,960
Precisely.

669
01:04:39,904 --> 01:04:41,067
Do you have a better theory?

670
01:04:41,101 --> 01:04:42,101
Yeah.

671
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:43,294
You're full of shit.

672
01:04:43,319 --> 01:04:44,670
How about that as a theory?

673
01:04:44,886 --> 01:04:45,726
Listen to me, Einstein.

674
01:04:45,778 --> 01:04:48,276
Have you actually fired this bullet?
- Of course not.

675
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,319
I figured, under the circumstances,

676
01:04:50,356 --> 01:04:52,998
it prudent to more fully examine
the bullets in a cable field.

677
01:04:53,050 --> 01:04:53,533
Oh, yes.

678
01:04:53,596 --> 01:04:56,093
But listen, I may not have a degree

679
01:04:56,140 --> 01:05:00,155
from the University of Scientific
Smart Asses, but I do know guns.

680
01:05:00,366 --> 01:05:06,332
When I point this barrel
at that target and pull this

681
01:05:06,377 --> 01:05:09,865
trigger here, that's where
the bullet's got to go.

682
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:13,707
Don't fire the gun..!
- Homing system or no homing system.

683
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:17,563
Oh, shit, man!

684
01:05:56,994 --> 01:05:58,638
That was gunshots

685
01:06:11,584 --> 01:06:12,848
Where you going?

686
01:06:29,340 --> 01:06:30,986
Die, you little bastard

687
01:07:36,007 --> 01:07:38,006
What the heck is going on.

688
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,516
God, who's that?

689
01:08:02,564 --> 01:08:06,376
What the hell are you doing here?
I knew he'd come back for these weapons.

690
01:08:18,006 --> 01:08:20,941
Don't do that again.
Stay out of the way and let me handle this.

691
01:08:29,956 --> 01:08:30,994
Holy shit!

692
01:08:33,393 --> 01:08:37,393
Time you got off the fucking fence ET.
You gonna kill this piece of shit or not?

693
01:08:38,001 --> 01:08:40,782
Because poach is not
a capital offense, right?

694
01:08:41,439 --> 01:08:42,748
Yeah, that's what I thought.

695
01:08:42,773 --> 01:08:45,229
Where's these other weapons? The big gamer.

696
01:08:45,613 --> 01:08:46,642
The Cannon? I don't know.

697
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:47,700
The prop room, I guess.

698
01:08:47,725 --> 01:08:48,725
Where's that?

699
01:08:49,714 --> 01:08:52,320
Oh, shit. Right there.

700
01:08:59,539 --> 01:09:00,909
Let's go!

701
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:13,229
Warden: We gotta get the
rest of these animals out of here!

702
01:09:20,764 --> 01:09:22,497
Warden: Please get the
safety, I'll use this one.

703
01:09:22,521 --> 01:09:24,856
Aw, fuck you, you ten-dollar piece of shit.

704
01:09:25,296 --> 01:09:26,296
Out!

705
01:09:27,952 --> 01:09:30,952
Voltage! You guys
can't handle high voltage.

706
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,711
Warden: What is that? A taser?

707
01:09:41,426 --> 01:09:42,978
I'm gonna fry his ass!

708
01:09:43,540 --> 01:09:44,791
Warden: Where you going?

709
01:09:45,673 --> 01:09:47,718
Warden: Thinking you can
sneak up on him, are you?

710
01:09:48,281 --> 01:09:50,280
He'll never expect me to come after him.

711
01:09:50,379 --> 01:09:51,996
When was the last time a
monkey out, spotted you?

712
01:09:52,020 --> 01:09:53,807
Oh, fuck you, Obi-Wan.

713
01:09:57,280 --> 01:09:58,280
Let's go!

714
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:01,177
- What kind of leather is that jacket?
Warden: Stegosaurus

715
01:10:01,201 --> 01:10:02,201
As in dinosaur?

716
01:10:02,241 --> 01:10:04,095
Now you know why they're extinct.

717
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:49,198
Chief Dawes, Chief Dawes.

718
01:10:49,228 --> 01:10:51,226
Do you know who is
responsible for the attacks?

719
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:53,153
Was it a militant terrorist group?

720
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,707
Could it have been a lone individual.

721
01:10:58,307 --> 01:10:59,307
Come on.

722
01:11:04,103 --> 01:11:08,567
Well, the good news is, uh, no broken
bones, but you're gonna be sore for a while.

723
01:11:08,919 --> 01:11:09,655
Daddy!

724
01:11:09,761 --> 01:11:11,929
Oh, baby, hey, hey, hey, come here.

725
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:13,114
Oh, hey.

726
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,632
Okay, where's mommy?

727
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:16,680
She couldn't keep up.

728
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:18,612
Well, it's part of the course, isn't it?

729
01:11:18,637 --> 01:11:20,504
Oh, thank God.

730
01:11:20,793 --> 01:11:21,793
Oh, sweetie.

731
01:11:22,014 --> 01:11:24,595
When I saw the news, I
thought you were...

732
01:11:25,007 --> 01:11:25,926
You okay?
I'm okay.

733
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,951
You okay?

734
01:11:27,053 --> 01:11:28,206
Really? Sure you're okay?

735
01:11:28,252 --> 01:11:29,272
I'm really fine, Okay?

736
01:11:29,297 --> 01:11:31,083
Oh, sweetie... oh, sorry.
- Aw!

737
01:11:32,014 --> 01:11:33,014
Oh, baby.

738
01:11:33,653 --> 01:11:34,653
Okay, you know what?

739
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:37,329
Just try to get some rest and
take a aspirin for the pain.

740
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:38,169
Thanks, Doc.

741
01:11:38,194 --> 01:11:39,113
Thank you so much, Doc.

742
01:11:39,151 --> 01:11:40,151
I could've told him that.

743
01:11:40,181 --> 01:11:41,796
Listen, Chief Dawes is
out in the waiting room.

744
01:11:41,820 --> 01:11:42,819
He's waiting for you.

745
01:11:42,844 --> 01:11:45,843
And he wants to see you as soon
as you get done with this

746
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:47,413
Leather.

747
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:48,760
Shit.

748
01:11:48,893 --> 01:11:49,893
Mom, dad said shit.

749
01:11:50,013 --> 01:11:51,013
I know honey.

750
01:11:51,061 --> 01:11:52,616
How come he doesn't get a lecture?

751
01:11:52,667 --> 01:11:53,616
Shit.

752
01:11:53,648 --> 01:11:55,072
Ew, he's done it again.

753
01:11:55,097 --> 01:11:55,805
Honey, what is it?

754
01:11:55,830 --> 01:11:57,313
I just realized that the
kill has been hiding.

755
01:11:57,337 --> 01:11:58,144
I need your car.

756
01:11:58,169 --> 01:11:59,505
Wyznowski will take you
home and I see you tonight.

757
01:11:59,529 --> 01:12:01,041
Keys.
- What about Chief Dawes?

758
01:12:01,496 --> 01:12:02,946
Aren't you gonna take backup?

759
01:12:02,994 --> 01:12:03,994
He's already there.

760
01:12:04,314 --> 01:12:04,988
I love you.

761
01:12:05,013 --> 01:12:05,548
I love you...

762
01:12:05,605 --> 01:12:06,405
..I love you.

763
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:09,429
If you get yourself killed, I
swear I'll never speak to you again.

764
01:13:11,734 --> 01:13:13,855
Warden: Lieutenant,
what are you doing here?

765
01:13:14,587 --> 01:13:15,587
Looking for you.

766
01:13:20,506 --> 01:13:22,038
How did you find this place?

767
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,853
Well, I figured he must have
reason for coming here the

768
01:13:24,877 --> 01:13:27,539
other night, and then you
were here waiting for him.

769
01:13:27,673 --> 01:13:31,672
Warden: I had a trap set for him until
you showed up and ruined it.

770
01:13:44,009 --> 01:13:45,142
What is this place?

771
01:13:45,283 --> 01:13:46,933
Warden: The human blind.

772
01:13:47,453 --> 01:13:48,953
What, like a duck blind?

773
01:13:49,561 --> 01:13:50,561
Yes.

774
01:13:50,655 --> 01:13:52,775
Warden: We have thousands of
them all over the planet.

775
01:13:52,994 --> 01:13:55,993
Warden: So we can study humans
unobserved in their natural environment.

776
01:13:56,227 --> 01:13:57,514
It's like a game warden.

777
01:13:58,696 --> 01:14:00,056
Warden: Something like that, yeah.

778
01:14:00,616 --> 01:14:03,966
So we're just animals to you,
even you and I are talking like this.

779
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:07,900
Warden: Your scientists
communicate with apes and dolphins.

780
01:14:08,567 --> 01:14:10,798
But that's hardly the same thing.

781
01:14:11,169 --> 01:14:13,276
Warden: You ever heard
of a gorilla named Koko?

782
01:14:13,746 --> 01:14:14,946
No.

783
01:14:15,881 --> 01:14:18,546
Warden: Well, your scientists have
taught her sign language.

784
01:14:19,016 --> 01:14:22,520
Warden: Now, she's able to communicate
like a deaf mute human.

785
01:14:23,419 --> 01:14:26,616
Warden: She even asked for pet
kitten, describing great

786
01:14:26,641 --> 01:14:28,630
detail of exact color
and type she wanted.

787
01:14:30,570 --> 01:14:31,953
Warden: She named it ball.

788
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:35,735
Warden: But she's still only an animal.

789
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:38,395
Warden: Isn't she?

790
01:14:40,513 --> 01:14:41,513
Well, yeah.

791
01:14:46,614 --> 01:14:48,613
Warden: We've been found!

792
01:14:56,050 --> 01:14:57,057
Warden: Are you alright?

793
01:14:57,082 --> 01:14:58,082
Yeah, thank you.

794
01:14:58,144 --> 01:14:59,310
Warden: You'll be safer in the back.

795
01:14:59,334 --> 01:15:02,277
Warden: He can't use his Big Gamer without
destroying his own camping ship.

796
01:15:02,301 --> 01:15:03,821
Warden: He can only use his poach gun.

797
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:09,197
That was one of those guns that shoots
many guided missiles, right?

798
01:15:09,221 --> 01:15:10,221
Warden: Yeah.

799
01:15:10,326 --> 01:15:12,325
Greg, I'd much rather
be killed by one of those.

800
01:15:17,281 --> 01:15:18,699
Warden: Here we are.

801
01:15:19,361 --> 01:15:20,075
Where?

802
01:15:20,254 --> 01:15:21,649
Warden: His craft.

803
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,439
Warden: I'm going aboard to set his
auto-destruct mechanism, so he can't escape.

804
01:15:26,994 --> 01:15:29,114
Warden: You stay out here and
keep an eye out for him.

805
01:16:04,681 --> 01:16:06,497
Warden: Alright, you've got five
minutes to get out of here.

806
01:16:06,521 --> 01:16:08,322
No way, I want him more than you do.

807
01:16:08,374 --> 01:16:09,736
Warden: I'm not the one in danger.

808
01:16:09,841 --> 01:16:11,599
You ever heard of Dian Fossey?

809
01:16:11,962 --> 01:16:13,253
Warden: We're not barbarians, human.

810
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:15,037
Warden: We don't kill
one another like you do.

811
01:16:15,061 --> 01:16:17,060
No, you're just destroying entire species.

812
01:16:17,101 --> 01:16:18,101
Warden: And you don't?

813
01:16:18,876 --> 01:16:21,976
Warden: Why do you think we made your
planet a protected game preserve?

814
01:16:22,314 --> 01:16:24,183
Warden: Why do you think I'm
trying to save your life?

815
01:16:24,207 --> 01:16:26,557
Well you're not trying
hard enough, if you ask me.

816
01:16:28,081 --> 01:16:28,663
That?

817
01:16:28,713 --> 01:16:29,713
No, stop, no.

818
01:16:30,334 --> 01:16:31,334
No.

819
01:16:46,001 --> 01:16:47,001
No!

820
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,606
You son of a bitch!

821
01:17:22,188 --> 01:17:24,288
Mother fucker.

822
01:17:54,886 --> 01:17:56,886
Oh, man.

823
01:18:07,473 --> 01:18:08,867
Phil!

824
01:19:22,677 --> 01:19:23,677
Ow man!

825
01:19:32,174 --> 01:19:33,183
Warden: You're all right.

826
01:19:34,818 --> 01:19:35,793
Warden: That's good.

827
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:36,840
Yeah, but you're not.

828
01:19:37,034 --> 01:19:38,817
We have got to get you to a hospital.

829
01:19:38,900 --> 01:19:39,900
Warden: No.

830
01:19:41,132 --> 01:19:43,135
Warden: It's nothing
your doctors can do for me.

831
01:19:44,182 --> 01:19:45,906
We won't know till we try.

832
01:19:46,387 --> 01:19:49,362
And don't give me any crap about I
wouldn't let a monkey operate on me.

833
01:19:50,176 --> 01:19:51,726
Warden: You wouldn't!

834
01:20:00,654 --> 01:20:02,667
Shit!
The auto-destruct.

835
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:34,063
- Girls, Daddy's home.

836
01:20:34,477 --> 01:20:36,202
- And he brought a surprise.

837
01:20:36,256 --> 01:20:37,736
- Oh, oh my gosh!

838
01:20:37,893 --> 01:20:40,357
Is he ours? Can we keep him?
- We can.

839
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,007
- What's his name?

840
01:20:42,038 --> 01:20:43,340
- His name is Warden.

841
01:20:43,515 --> 01:20:44,515
And...

842
01:20:47,167 --> 01:20:48,754
He brought a little friend with him.

843
01:20:50,087 --> 01:20:51,909
- Yeah, what's his name, Daddy?

844
01:20:51,934 --> 01:20:53,209
- His name is Warden two.

845
01:20:53,386 --> 01:20:54,928
- Well, wont that be a bit confusing?

846
01:20:54,986 --> 01:20:57,649
- No, just call him Warden the
puppy and Warden the mouse.

847
01:20:57,733 --> 01:20:58,733
- Yeah, I like that.

848
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:00,779
Um, it's kind of cool.

849
01:21:01,127 --> 01:21:02,876
- Well, the ayes have it.

850
01:21:03,347 --> 01:21:06,735
So why don't you light up the
coals and I'll go get the burgers.

851
01:21:06,820 --> 01:21:09,822
- Honey, I'm not really in
the mood for meat right now.

852
01:21:09,847 --> 01:21:12,846
How about we go in the house
and we boil up some pasta?

853
01:21:13,187 --> 01:21:14,523
- Say you guys want spaghetti?

854
01:21:14,566 --> 01:21:15,869
- Yeah!

855
01:21:16,264 --> 01:21:18,798
Look at him, he's so cute!

856
01:21:18,838 --> 01:21:19,485
I love him.

857
01:21:19,510 --> 01:21:21,538
- So... a dog and a mouse.

858
01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:22,720
- Yeah.

859
01:21:22,787 --> 01:21:24,273
- Why the sudden change of heart?

860
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,692
- Now whatta you saying?

861
01:21:26,053 --> 01:21:28,259
I've always loved animals, you know that.
