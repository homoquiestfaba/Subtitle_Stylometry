Good afternoon, sir. 
Sergeant Tyler.

5
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,413
This is Christo's gang. 
I think you knew 
the victim, Sam Latham.

6
00:02:09,448 --> 00:02:12,344
Three 18-year-old prostitutes
mutilated to send him
a message.

7
00:02:12,379 --> 00:02:14,448
Here I got two prosecutors...

8
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:17,448
burned to death for refusing
to accept bribes, hmm.

9
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,896

embarrassed to count 
Christo among your clients.

11
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:30,068
Now, we picked up 
a guy last night. 
We can't identify him.

12
00:02:30,103 --> 00:02:33,103
But we believe 
he's Christo.

13
00:02:33,137 --> 00:02:37,000
We have nothing 
to connect him 
to any crime.

14
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:39,275
There's no legal way 
we can hold him.

15
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:42,620
Mr. Nile, the word on the street is that you're laundering money for him.

16
00:02:42,655 --> 00:02:45,068
You're the only person 
we know who can 
identify him.

17
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:47,793
Captain Tyler, my relationship with my clients...

18
00:02:47,827 --> 00:02:50,068
is bound by strict confidentiality,

19
00:02:50,103 --> 00:02:54,000
and if you think that I'm gonna break that confidentiality for you,

20
00:02:54,034 --> 00:02:56,965

So?

26
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:26,689

00:03:45,896 --> 00:03:48,379
I have a big client.
 I mean, serious.

32
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:50,758
A black guy.
He's called Mlambo.

33
00:03:53,517 --> 00:03:57,379
He wants his accountant to testify against some motherfucker called Christo.

34
00:03:57,413 --> 00:04:01,172
Last week, the cop picked up the cunt while busting some other fucker.

35
00:04:01,206 --> 00:04:04,379
The money man has the evidence to get him banged up for life.

36
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:06,793
Mlambo wants you to protect this guy.

37
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:09,517
You go and you
take care of him.

38
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:12,034
How much?Fifty thousand dollars now,

39
00:04:12,068 --> 00:04:14,896
and 150,000 when
he goes to court.

40
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:16,586
Good money.

41
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:23,034
Just one thing.

42
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,689
It's in Cape Town.

43
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:29,896
You're kidding.

44
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:33,034

right?

45
00:04:33,068 --> 00:04:37,413
Fuck, Alex, all right,
all right. That whole thing
was 30 years ago.

46
00:04:37,448 --> 00:04:39,379
Thirty years.

47

I can't promise anything.

I don't think it's a good idea for you to stay here in town...

50

until after the trial is over.

51
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:59,965
Christo will hit us
with everything he's got
when he finds out.

52
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,965
I love Cape Town. 
I'm not running like a rat.

55

I never ask a question
 I didn't want the answer to.

56
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,931
I managed their cash.

57
00:05:17,965 --> 00:05:20,379
No books, no paper trail.
