1
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:47,524
I wrote it aII down:
4,222 square feet, four fIoors. perfect.

2
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:50,319
Courtyard in back,
south-facing garden. Perfect.

3
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:53,906
-Shouldn't we wait for the car service?
-No, we'll sit in traffic forever.

4
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:56,491
-ls that the listing sheet?
-There isn't one.

5
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:59,286
l heard about it this morning.
lt'll be gone soon.

6
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:02,456
-How many more?
-None. You know the market is tight.

7
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,543
-Sarah, do you have to ride that here?
-Mom, we're in the street.

8
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,421
Evan!

9
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,761
One day you will learn
to respect people's time, Lydia.

10
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:20,390
You'll realize that the world does not stop
and start at your convenience.

11
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,767
l'm so sorry.

12
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:24,728
l'm meeting Arthur Digby Laurence
in 26 minutes...

13
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,440
...and if you think he's the kind of man
who tolerates tardiness...

14
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,442
...you are sadly mistaken.

15
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,986
You're a saint to wait for us.

16
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,947
-Thank you.
-Hello.

17
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:41,119
lt's kind of between a townhouse
and a brownstone.

18
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:43,664
We call it a ''townstone.''

19
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:48,502
Built in 1879, this is the middle
of the house, the parlor floor.

20
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:52,798
Here is the living room.
Formal dining is in the back.

21
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:55,592
Casual dining below on the kitchen floor...

22
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:59,721
...which was renovated in '94
with all the expected amenities.

23
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,223
Sarah.

24
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,185
There are two bedroom floors above.

25
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,147
My God, it's amazing.

26
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,525
Hey, kid. No scooter.

27
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:17,155
l don't have to tell you this amount
of living space is uncommon in Manhattan.

28
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:22,578
lt's got a yard. Sort of.

29
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,206
lt is in a bit of disarray, but then again,
21-foot lot, 53 deep.

30
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:29,251
lt allows for an expansive garden.

31
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,420
Working elevator.

32
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,757
The previous owner was disabled
the last years of his life.

33
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,426
Highly unusual, the elevator.

34
00:03:37,593 --> 00:03:39,928
You will not find this
in 90 percent of brownstones.

35
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,266
Perhaps it's something of a fixer-upper,
but we anticipate enormous interest.

36
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,603
lt's a very emotional property.

37
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,189
Shall we have a look at the rest?

38
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,236
You should make an offer immediately.

39
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,738
Can l see it first?

40
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:01,366
There is nothing like this
on the market right now.

41
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,952
You can't move from Greenwich
to the Upper West Side...

42
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:07,956
...and expect to still have a house, a yard
and a dog and cat, but here it is.

43
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,709
lt's got everything
you told me you wanted and more.

44
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,004
You'll have another family.
You could have two.

45
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,380
lt's a fortune.

46
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:18,717
Mom, it's not Barneys.
You don't have to pay the price on the tag.

47
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,891
He can afford it.

48
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:31,063
lt would be so lovely
if l could show the property before l leave.

49
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,739
Hardwood floors throughout,
as many as six working fireplaces.

50
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,284
This is the top floor. Two bedrooms.
One at either end.

51
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,328
They share one small bath.

52
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:49,206
Originally, this would have been
the servants' quarters.

53
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,917
The previous owner
kept a small nursing staff.

54
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:54,378
l don't know if you have live-in help.

55
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:57,256
No, it's just the two of us.

56
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,054
Third floor, spare bedroom, den,
or what have you.

57
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:06,640
Mr. Pearlstine used this as an office.

58
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:10,811
He's talking about Sidney Pearlstine,
the financier.

59
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,647
May l ask what you do, Mrs....

60
00:05:13,939 --> 00:05:15,524
Altman.

61
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:18,151
Actually, l'm going back to school.
Columbia.

62
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,321
Her husband's in pharmaceuticals.

63
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,158
l didn't realize
you were Stephan Altman's wife.

64
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:28,036
Yes, until recently.

65
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,497
Master bath.

66
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,044
Pearlstine's been in all the papers
since he died.

67
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,714
His kids are suing each other
over the estate.

68
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,841
He was a recluse. Rich, paranoid.

69
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:43,093
Now they can't find half his money.

70
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,096
l hardly see how gossip
is germane to showing the property.

71
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:49,474
Stop calling it ''the property.''
lt sounds ridiculous.

72
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,852
Walk-in closet.

73
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,066
Could the little one please stop that?

74
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:00,777
Kid, no elevator!

75
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:04,656
And we emerge in the master suite.

76
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,374
That's strange.

77
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,626
What?

78
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,218
ls this room smaller than it should be?

79
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:26,386
You're the first person to notice.

80
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:31,183
On caravan, no one from our office
had the slightest idea.

81
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,030
lt's called a panic room.

82
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,865
-What?
-A safe room.

83
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,077
-A castle keep in medieval times.
-l've read about these.

84
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,412
They're in vogue in high-end construction.

85
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,165
One can't be too careful
about home invasion.

86
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,625
This is perfect.

87
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,961
The alarm goes off
in the middle of the night.

88
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:02,047
What will you do?
Call the police and wait till Tuesday?

89
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,801
Traipse downstairs in your underthings
to check it out? l think not.

90
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,972
Concrete walls. Buried phone line,
not connected to the house's main line.

91
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:13,809
Call the police, nobody can cut you off.
You have your own ventilation system.

92
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:18,105
A bank of surveillance monitors that covers
nearly every corner of the house.

93
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:20,399
This whole thing makes me nervous.

94
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,817
Why?

95
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,735
Ever read any Poe?

96
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,071
No, but l loved her last album.

97
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,576
What's to keep somebody
from prying open the door?

98
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:31,827
Steel.

99
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,538
Thick steel. Very thick steel.

100
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:37,207
Full battery backup,
so even if the power's out...

101
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:38,917
...it's still functional.

102
00:07:40,294 --> 00:07:43,922
Oh, my god.
Old Sidney didn't miss a trick, did he?

103
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:45,132
Open it, please.

104
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:48,802
And with kids like he's apparently got,
no wonder he wanted a place to hide.

105
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,095
Please open the door.

106
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,763
That is highly inappropriate.

107
00:07:51,847 --> 00:07:53,807
Open the door, please.

108
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,732
My room. Definitely my room.

109
00:08:01,857 --> 00:08:03,442
This is really dangerous.

110
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,945
-That door is a hazard.
-Not at all.

111
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,451
Motion detector, like an elevator.

112
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:16,163
The door won't close if it's blocked.
There's another one at your ankles.

113
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,415
lt couldn't be safer.

114
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:36,058
l know they'll take asking price.

115
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:55,619
lt's working. l hooked up the phone!

116
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:58,664
Good for you, Mom. Hooked up a phone.

117
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:00,499
579 what?

118
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,668
3000.

119
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,175
patsy's pizza. pIease hoId.

120
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,599
Hey. Enough.

121
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:27,359
Mind the pizza?

122
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,861
What do you mean?

123
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:33,323
Our first night.
l should've thought of something special.

124
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,908
l like pizza.

125
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:52,176
Fuck him.

126
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:55,721
Don't.

127
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:59,016
Fuck her, too.

128
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,976
l agree.

129
00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,770
But don't.

130
00:10:23,957 --> 00:10:26,710
Don't you think this place
has way too many stairs?

131
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:28,629
You didn't carry anything up them.

132
00:10:28,754 --> 00:10:31,215
You never asked
what l thought of this house.

133
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:33,425
l didn't want you to tell me you hated it.

134
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:36,845
-l liked our old house.
-Well, so did l.

135
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,306
You know what l was thinking?

136
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:43,060
l was thinking we could
stencil the whole bookcase.

137
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,021
We could cut the stencils, do it ourselves.

138
00:10:46,897 --> 00:10:48,023
Go ahead.

139
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:55,531
Oh, damn.

140
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:58,825
l forgot to set up that tour
of your new school.

141
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:02,287
Dad already did it.
l'm going with him on Sunday.

142
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:03,789
Oh, yeah?

143
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,333
So l'll take a cab and meet him there.

144
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,504
ls that what he said?

145
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,423
lsn't that what's so great
about Manhattan?

146
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:15,634
You don't have to drive me everywhere?

147
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,136
l'll ride with you.

148
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,473
Why'd you bring me here
if l can't go anywhere on my own?

149
00:11:21,598 --> 00:11:23,141
That's it. l quit.

150
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,062
l'm not fighting with you till tomorrow.

151
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,106
Come here.

152
00:11:30,774 --> 00:11:32,776
lt's disgusting how much l love you.

153
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,528
Tell me about it.

154
00:11:41,076 --> 00:11:43,036
-Mom?
-Yeah.

155
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,539
lt's too dark.

156
00:12:01,722 --> 00:12:02,848
Better?

157
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,808
That's better.

158
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,709
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

159
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:43,509
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

160
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,345
''Shunt. Enter.''

161
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:59,399
''Bypass non-ready zone.''

162
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:01,068
''Shunt.''

163
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,196
''Enter zone number.''

164
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,699
''Shunt again.''

165
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:16,875
ln the morning l got to figure out
how to turn this thing off.

166
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:34,494
Go, go back.

167
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,791
Do it.

168
00:20:14,882 --> 00:20:18,468
Come on. Come on. Jesus fucking Christ.

169
00:20:18,927 --> 00:20:20,220
Amateur.

170
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:28,395
We got a problem! We need to talk!

171
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:31,106
lt's about time. l'm freezing
my tits off out there.

172
00:20:35,611 --> 00:20:37,988
-Who is that?
-This is Raoul.

173
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,531
Who the fuck is Raoul?

174
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,492
Raoul is okay. Raoul has experience.

175
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:44,953
-Where'd you get him?
-Through some people.

176
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,705
Open the fucking door.

177
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,294
No shit.

178
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:58,383
What is this?

179
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:01,845
There's a girl on the top floor,
a woman on the third. They're asleep.

180
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,347
They're not supposed to be here.

181
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:06,683
-This is your department, Junior!
-They are not supposed to be here!

182
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:08,727
Videotape. We're on videotape.

183
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,814
We've been on videotape since we got here
and the tapes are upstairs.

184
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,441
-14-day escrow.
-You fucked me!

185
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:18,570
14-day escrow! That's almost 3 weeks!
They should not be in for another week!

186
00:21:20,447 --> 00:21:23,283
Exactly how is 14 days three weeks?

187
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:26,119
Business days.
Escrow is always business days.

188
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:27,955
Five-day weeks always!

189
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:33,669
Right?

190
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:36,088
l'm out of here.

191
00:21:37,005 --> 00:21:39,091
Just wait a minute. Wait a minute!

192
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,427
We can handle this.
Can we still handle this?

193
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,763
lt's just a woman and a kid?

194
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,099
-Unless Daddy comes home.
-He's not.

195
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:51,103
They're divorcing. Daddy's banging some
B model on the Upper East Side.

196
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:52,980
lt's just her and the kid!

197
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,023
Now, can we do this?

198
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,235
Yeah, we can do it.

199
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,321
Not with people here. And not with me.

200
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,787
-Wait! Twenty minutes!
-She'll call the police.

201
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:10,831
They'll be here before l unpack my bags.

202
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:13,959
So, we keep an eye on her.

203
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:17,671
Raoul can totally administrate that part.

204
00:22:17,963 --> 00:22:21,800
l don't want Raoul to administrate that!
He's not even supposed to be here!

205
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,638
Nobody gets hurt.

206
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,475
What about us? What if she has a gun?

207
00:22:33,645 --> 00:22:34,813
Who are you?

208
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:37,482
l'm Raoul.

209
00:22:51,997 --> 00:22:53,999
You know we can't do this without you!

210
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,876
This is still a good plan.

211
00:22:56,084 --> 00:23:00,214
Fuck that! This is a great plan.
lt's just got a slight twist.

212
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,632
Yeah.

213
00:23:01,924 --> 00:23:03,842
Felony kidnapping. Thirty years.

214
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:08,764
You make a lot of promises, don't you?
You promise me, you promise your kids.

215
00:23:09,806 --> 00:23:10,849
No family.

216
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:15,687
You're right. lt's all fucked up.
l fucked it up!

217
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,856
lt's not how it's supposed to be.

218
00:23:21,693 --> 00:23:26,406
But the fact of the matter is
there's still $3,000,000 in this house...

219
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:30,661
...and no one but you and l
even knows it's here.

220
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,831
Hey, l want that money. l want it!

221
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,583
But you...

222
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:40,003
...you need that money.

223
00:23:40,921 --> 00:23:44,049
Or have you forgotten why you're here?

224
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:51,223
So let's quit dicking around, okay,
and get this over with.

225
00:23:57,563 --> 00:23:59,398
Kill the phones.

226
00:26:39,808 --> 00:26:42,769
Top floor, little girl. l've got the mother.
Give me that!

227
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:46,523
You stay here! Nobody gets past!

228
00:26:57,492 --> 00:26:58,744
Wake up! Sarah!

229
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:01,413
Get up!

230
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:09,296
What did you do that for?

231
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,639
Where are you going?

232
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:31,235
-What's going on?
-People. ln the house.

233
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:36,156
They're in the elevator, heading down.

234
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:56,510
Fuck! They're coming down to you!

235
00:27:56,677 --> 00:27:59,096
l told you. l don't hurt people.

236
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:03,475
They're going downstairs.

237
00:28:05,978 --> 00:28:07,145
-That room.
-What?

238
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,730
The panic room.

239
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:11,400
No, press emergency stop.

240
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:17,072
Fuck!

241
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,077
Coming back up!

242
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:34,673
That's you.

243
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:39,011
Shit.

244
00:28:47,394 --> 00:28:48,562
Go!

245
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,856
Fuck!

246
00:28:50,981 --> 00:28:54,526
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

247
00:28:56,028 --> 00:28:57,529
Damn it! Mother--

248
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:01,491
Shit!

249
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,796
That's seven years bad luck.

250
00:29:16,882 --> 00:29:18,091
Shit.

251
00:29:32,898 --> 00:29:34,733
Tell me they're not in there.

252
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,879
Oh, damn.

253
00:29:56,797 --> 00:29:59,550
-lt doesn't work?
-lt's a different phone line.

254
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,511
l never hooked it up.

255
00:30:07,516 --> 00:30:08,684
Now what?

256
00:30:35,544 --> 00:30:37,129
l can't hear a thing.

257
00:30:38,046 --> 00:30:39,840
What do you think they want?

258
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:41,800
l don't know. Rob us....

259
00:30:44,678 --> 00:30:46,096
l don't know.

260
00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:47,764
What do we do?

261
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:49,933
We wait.

262
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,895
-What if they get in here?
-Well, they can't.

263
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,773
They can't get in. lt's not possible.

264
00:30:56,899 --> 00:30:58,483
Mom. l heard you.

265
00:31:02,404 --> 00:31:04,615
-Do you feel okay?
-Yeah.

266
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,158
-You shaky?
-No.

267
00:31:06,241 --> 00:31:07,701
-Chills?
-No.

268
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,498
Please. Don't worry about me.

269
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,435
He's got kids. What do you think he'll do?

270
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,355
Hang out while the cops waltz in?
Use your head.

271
00:31:36,605 --> 00:31:37,773
Here he comes.

272
00:31:37,898 --> 00:31:40,859
l locked the roof access.
She's not getting down from there.

273
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,904
-Good.
-She could be in there calling the cops.

274
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,198
Could she have hooked it up today?

275
00:31:46,281 --> 00:31:48,408
No. You don't just call up Bell Atlantic.

276
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:51,620
She would've had to do it through
Manhattan Security, my company.

277
00:31:51,787 --> 00:31:54,373
l checked the paperwork
and the phone is not connected.

278
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,500
You see? She couldn't have.

279
00:31:57,292 --> 00:32:00,546
-l thought she wouldn't be here.
-He said she wouldn't.

280
00:32:00,629 --> 00:32:03,549
Fuck you! And fuck you!
She is not supposed--

281
00:32:09,137 --> 00:32:10,264
Do it.

282
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,893
Excuse me.

283
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,231
The poIice are on their way.

284
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:30,951
-She's lying.
-You're full of--

285
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,165
lt's not an intercom. lt's a PA system.

286
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:39,960
l know. l'm just scaring her.

287
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,504
I suggest you Ieave before they get here.

288
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:50,179
-What?
-He's saying that we don't have a phone.

289
00:32:50,304 --> 00:32:51,722
How could he know that?

290
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:55,434
Take what you want and get outI

291
00:32:56,518 --> 00:32:58,478
lf only it were that easy.

292
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:03,817
Some paper. l need some paper.
Give me some paper.

293
00:33:03,942 --> 00:33:05,944
Hey, Zorro! You going to help us out?

294
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:07,571
You got a piece of paper?

295
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:14,453
-What is he doing?
-l don't know.

296
00:33:26,715 --> 00:33:29,009
''What we want is in that room''?

297
00:33:29,259 --> 00:33:31,261
They're coming in here, aren't they?

298
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,889
No, no. l told you. They can't get in here.

299
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:37,309
What do you know about this room?

300
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:39,144
What do we know about that room?

301
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:41,647
-Let's not tell her anything.
-Just a few details.

302
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:00,082
We're not coming out,
and we're not letting you in!

303
00:34:00,249 --> 00:34:02,125
Get out of my houseI

304
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:04,503
-Say ''fuck.''
-You fuck.

305
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:09,466
-Mom.
-What?

306
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:11,510
''Get the fuck out of my house.''

307
00:34:11,844 --> 00:34:13,762
Get the fuck out of my houseI

308
00:34:20,185 --> 00:34:21,770
Okay, l have an idea.

309
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,690
She's a woman. Women need security.

310
00:34:29,236 --> 00:34:30,737
She won't believe you.

311
00:34:31,029 --> 00:34:35,784
She needs to know she's dealing
with decent people and she can trust us.

312
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,543
Conversation's overI

313
00:34:48,297 --> 00:34:50,132
What? She's not coming down?

314
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:53,719
Shut up.
Will you please shut up and let me think?

315
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:55,971
Like that'll help you think.

316
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,432
You know what? Fine! You think!

317
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,684
-What if she did call the cops?
-She didn't.

318
00:35:00,809 --> 00:35:02,895
She said it again, that she called the cops.

319
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,480
lf cops were coming,
do you think l'd still be here?

320
00:35:05,606 --> 00:35:08,358
Okay, fine. Good, excellent.
We all believe you.

321
00:35:08,942 --> 00:35:10,736
How do we get into that room?

322
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,119
What is funny about this?

323
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,872
ls this shit funny to you?

324
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:25,292
l spent the last 12 years
building these rooms...

325
00:35:25,584 --> 00:35:27,628
...to keep out people like us.

326
00:35:27,753 --> 00:35:32,591
lt's all so ironic and amusing, okay?
Now, how do we get in?

327
00:35:34,218 --> 00:35:35,427
We can't.

328
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:38,180
You can't get in the panic room.

329
00:35:38,305 --> 00:35:41,934
That's the whole point.
We have to get her to come out.

330
00:35:42,518 --> 00:35:44,228
And why would she do that?

331
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,396
l don't know.

332
00:35:47,314 --> 00:35:50,609
But when she does,
she can't get out of this house.

333
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,988
We keep her here,
we keep her quiet for 20 minutes...

334
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:58,242
...and l don't want any help
from Joe Pesci over here.

335
00:35:58,992 --> 00:36:01,620
They want to hole up in this house? Fine.

336
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:04,206
We make it impossible for them to leave.

337
00:36:07,042 --> 00:36:09,795
And why would they come out
in the first place?

338
00:36:12,089 --> 00:36:13,841
l'm working on that.

339
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,226
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

340
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:28,730
Small space?

341
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,732
l'm okay.

342
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:33,777
-You can't wig out.
-l know.

343
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:35,612
-l mean it.
-l won't.

344
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:41,577
You know,
people never get buried alive anymore.

345
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:45,664
l guess it used to happen all the time.

346
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:47,958
Really?

347
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,626
Yeah, l read that.

348
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:53,172
And when did this happen all the time?

349
00:36:55,674 --> 00:36:57,759
Twenty, thirty years ago.

350
00:37:00,888 --> 00:37:02,723
What are they doing now?

351
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:10,772
l don't know.

352
00:38:11,458 --> 00:38:13,085
They're locking us in.

353
00:38:52,374 --> 00:38:54,209
This is not happening.

354
00:39:04,845 --> 00:39:06,263
Sarah, calm down.

355
00:39:08,473 --> 00:39:11,768
You know what could happen
if you let yourself get worked up.

356
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:14,229
Sarah!

357
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:47,221
-What the hell are you doing?
-We're coming in from below.

358
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:50,849
No, you're not. Even if you got through
the concrete, there's steel.

359
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:52,684
You won't even make a dent.

360
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:54,853
We'll see.

361
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,357
Hey. This is what l do.

362
00:39:58,649 --> 00:40:01,485
lf some idiot with a sledgehammer
could break in...

363
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:04,696
...do you really think
that l would still have a job?

364
00:40:13,664 --> 00:40:15,457
Don't get that in your eye.

365
00:40:49,867 --> 00:40:51,076
Neighbor.

366
00:40:51,326 --> 00:40:52,536
Help!

367
00:40:52,703 --> 00:40:54,955
Please help us!

368
00:40:55,539 --> 00:40:57,541
-Call the police!
-Do you hear us?

369
00:40:57,545 --> 00:40:59,042
Help us!

370
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:11,930
Help!

371
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:15,100
-Help us, please!
-Call the police!

372
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,395
Shit!

373
00:42:27,589 --> 00:42:29,675
You guys just going to stand there?

374
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:32,469
Why? What do you got, MacGyver?

375
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:09,923
He can't get in here with a hammer,
can he?

376
00:43:16,388 --> 00:43:18,599
Could you be any louder?

377
00:43:28,984 --> 00:43:30,944
Give me a hand with those boxes.

378
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:34,615
Listen, goddamn it!

379
00:43:35,032 --> 00:43:38,285
l'm in charge here.
Now, what the hell is going on?

380
00:43:44,208 --> 00:43:47,586
-They're going to get in here.
-No, they can't get in here.

381
00:43:51,215 --> 00:43:53,967
We're going to be fine. We'll be just fine.

382
00:45:00,284 --> 00:45:01,660
Oh, this is good.

383
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:04,830
This could work.

384
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,292
l was just thinking
that we should do something like this.

385
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:15,340
-Open it.
-l just did.

386
00:45:15,465 --> 00:45:17,301
Open it some more.

387
00:45:19,052 --> 00:45:21,305
We're just sending them a message.

388
00:45:22,514 --> 00:45:24,057
They'll get the point.

389
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:03,722
Honey, get down on the ground.

390
00:46:12,397 --> 00:46:15,734
Quit dicking around
and open this fucking thing up.

391
00:46:15,817 --> 00:46:17,945
-Don't be stupid.
-Quiet!

392
00:46:18,070 --> 00:46:20,656
We're trying to scare them, not kill them.

393
00:46:27,746 --> 00:46:29,164
What is it?

394
00:46:29,915 --> 00:46:30,916
lt's bad.

395
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,545
They're coughing.

396
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:37,172
lf they're coughing, they're going to die!

397
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,924
Nobody is going to die, man!

398
00:46:39,007 --> 00:46:42,344
Will you please have the balls
to follow through with something?

399
00:46:57,651 --> 00:46:58,819
Mom.

400
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,785
The worst that'll happen is they'll pass out.
They'll have a hangover.

401
00:47:06,869 --> 00:47:10,080
How are we going to get in there
if they pass out, Junior?

402
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,959
Cut it back a little.

403
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:17,045
They won't pass out, numb-nuts.
They'll throw up first.

404
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:19,214
We can't get in if they're dead!

405
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:23,760
Stay on the ground and breathe.

406
00:47:30,601 --> 00:47:32,060
Turn it down.

407
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,271
Turn it down! lt's too much!

408
00:47:34,438 --> 00:47:36,940
-Don't you start up with this shit.
-Keep it down!

409
00:47:48,076 --> 00:47:49,328
l'm turning it down.

410
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:51,914
-Keep his ass off of me.
-We're not killing anybody.

411
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:05,511
-Tell him to turn it down!
-Turn the shit off.

412
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,846
-No.
-Turn it down.

413
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:21,568
-Mom?
-Just a second.

414
00:48:26,114 --> 00:48:27,324
Get under this.

415
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:30,160
Oh, my god.

416
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,080
-Fucking amateurs, man!
-lt's my fucking idea.

417
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:46,593
Shut the fuck up!
There are people trying to sleep over there.

418
00:49:11,201 --> 00:49:12,494
What is that?

419
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,497
Turn the gas off.

420
00:49:24,673 --> 00:49:26,550
Turn the gas off right now.

421
00:49:50,199 --> 00:49:51,533
Get back!

422
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,327
Shit!

423
00:49:56,246 --> 00:49:57,581
God!

424
00:49:57,706 --> 00:49:58,999
Get it off me!

425
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:06,632
lt's okay.

426
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:13,972
You fucking bitch! You fucking bitch!
l'm coming in there!

427
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:17,142
Calm the fuck down.

428
00:50:27,361 --> 00:50:29,279
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

429
00:50:30,864 --> 00:50:35,327
Promise me you'll never do
anything like that.

430
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:37,538
l won't.

431
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:43,919
They're moving.
At least they're still moving in there.

432
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:57,349
What?

433
00:50:58,058 --> 00:50:59,351
Talk to him.

434
00:51:02,437 --> 00:51:04,815
Please, man, give it a rest.

435
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:08,253
-That Morse code?
-SOS.

436
00:52:08,504 --> 00:52:10,088
Where'd you learn that?

437
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:11,632
Titanic.

438
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,103
We got to talk. Downstairs.

439
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:33,612
No, no, no. Not you.

440
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:43,580
Come on, come on, come on.

441
00:52:44,915 --> 00:52:46,166
Get up.

442
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:48,627
Come on.

443
00:52:57,803 --> 00:52:59,137
Wake up.

444
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:08,480
The first thing l'm going to do this morning
is call my plastic surgeon.

445
00:53:08,564 --> 00:53:13,569
There's been a change here.
$100,000 is not enough. Not for this shit.

446
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:17,781
l want a third
of whatever's in that room up there.

447
00:53:21,994 --> 00:53:22,953
Fine!

448
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:27,374
Okay? Full share, one-third.
Congratulations.

449
00:53:27,378 --> 00:53:32,171
You bought a ski mask, made $1,000,000.
Your parents will be proud.

450
00:53:54,568 --> 00:53:55,819
Got him.

451
00:53:56,320 --> 00:54:00,282
Let me straighten out something else.
Get control of your goddamn expert.

452
00:54:00,532 --> 00:54:02,868
l'm not losing
my half of the money because--

453
00:54:02,993 --> 00:54:04,453
Slow down. Half?

454
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:07,998
Did you sleep through grade school?
Five seconds ago, it was a third....

455
00:54:08,957 --> 00:54:10,209
Come on.

456
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:17,549
l'm letting you know he's a problem.

457
00:54:17,799 --> 00:54:20,552
But this wasn't my idea,
so he's your problem.

458
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,971
You're right. lt wasn't your idea!

459
00:54:23,096 --> 00:54:25,224
None of this was your idea!
lt was my idea!

460
00:54:28,727 --> 00:54:30,479
Come on, look over here.

461
00:54:43,033 --> 00:54:44,117
Yes.

462
00:54:44,993 --> 00:54:46,286
Yes, yes, yes.

463
00:54:49,915 --> 00:54:52,251
Let's hope this guy's an ex-Boy Scout.

464
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:00,259
-We're here!
-Help us!

465
00:55:00,342 --> 00:55:02,135
We're over here!

466
00:55:12,646 --> 00:55:13,856
Help!

467
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:16,149
Open your window!

468
00:55:16,316 --> 00:55:17,568
Help!

469
00:55:26,118 --> 00:55:28,412
We're never going to get out of here.

470
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:40,132
l'm the loving grandson who put in
the time with the old man...

471
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:42,634
...every goddamn weekend for two years...

472
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:45,846
...talking to him, dressing him,
walking him, feeding him.

473
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:47,431
Are you done?

474
00:55:47,556 --> 00:55:50,809
No. l'm the one the old man
finally told about the safe.

475
00:55:50,934 --> 00:55:54,771
l'm the one who found the guy who built it,
and l convinced him to break into it!

476
00:55:58,483 --> 00:55:59,735
Wait a minute.

477
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:06,116
-What?
-The bedroom's empty. Where are they?

478
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:10,078
Two of them, on the stairs.

479
00:56:10,871 --> 00:56:12,414
Where's the third guy?

480
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,462
l left my cell phone by the bed.

481
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:24,468
l earned that money.

482
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,262
l will not let you jeopardize
my fucking plan...

483
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:30,682
...because you have a problem
relating to others!

484
00:56:32,267 --> 00:56:33,519
Got it?

485
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:37,022
lf l don't come back, close this door.

486
00:56:37,105 --> 00:56:38,899
Just do what l say.

487
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:43,153
He touches me again, l'll shoot him.

488
00:56:43,237 --> 00:56:44,279
Christ!

489
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:47,950
Wait!

490
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:54,790
Any other schoolyard bullshit to settle,
or can we get back to work?

491
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,209
Don't take no tone with me, jerk-wad.

492
00:56:57,417 --> 00:57:00,254
l'll shove it up your ass and snap it off.

493
00:57:00,379 --> 00:57:03,757
You're a bus driver, Raoul.

494
00:57:04,216 --> 00:57:05,551
You live in Flatbush.

495
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:08,512
Don't spout some Elmore Leonard
bullshit you just heard...

496
00:57:08,804 --> 00:57:10,556
...because l saw that movie, too.

497
00:57:11,014 --> 00:57:11,974
What is this?

498
00:57:14,268 --> 00:57:15,686
l got some news for you.

499
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,356
Go.

500
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:21,024
Go!

501
00:59:09,925 --> 00:59:10,843
Fuck!

502
00:59:12,928 --> 00:59:15,514
She got something. What did she get?

503
00:59:16,682 --> 00:59:17,599
No.

504
00:59:19,768 --> 00:59:20,936
Charger!

505
00:59:21,687 --> 00:59:23,814
She has a cell phone.

506
00:59:25,357 --> 00:59:26,316
No!

507
00:59:28,277 --> 00:59:29,611
All right, signal.

508
00:59:29,862 --> 00:59:32,531
Come on. Signal.

509
00:59:44,126 --> 00:59:47,504
l don't think they'll be talking
on no cell phone from in there.

510
00:59:48,589 --> 00:59:51,216
-Why not?
-You can't call out from in there.

511
00:59:54,178 --> 00:59:55,679
No signal.

512
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:08,066
l didn't hook up this line,
but l hooked up the main line.

513
01:00:08,192 --> 01:00:10,694
lf we can find it, we can cut into it.

514
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:17,492
l can't go to prison, man.
l'm not built for that shit.

515
01:00:28,795 --> 01:00:29,796
Be careful.

516
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,601
Get the phone.

517
01:00:42,809 --> 01:00:44,895
-lt doesn't come off.
-Rip it off!

518
01:00:56,448 --> 01:00:58,617
Screwdriver. Phillips.

519
01:01:06,124 --> 01:01:10,337
Junior, when l asked you to cut
the phone lines, did you cut the main line?

520
01:01:10,712 --> 01:01:13,924
Or did you just cut the cord on the phone
in the kitchen?

521
01:01:39,950 --> 01:01:40,826
Shit!

522
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:45,998
Strip this and expose the wires.

523
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,333
-What are we doing?
-l have no idea.

524
01:02:16,445 --> 01:02:19,031
-Okay, got it?
-Yeah. Here.

525
01:02:19,281 --> 01:02:20,365
Okay.

526
01:02:20,866 --> 01:02:22,451
Yellow, yellow.

527
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:37,758
Okay.

528
01:02:40,177 --> 01:02:41,386
Dial tone.

529
01:02:50,479 --> 01:02:51,730
911 emergency.

530
01:02:51,980 --> 01:02:54,650
Yes, this is 38 West 94th Street--

531
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:57,945
-pIease hoId.
-No, no. God.

532
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:04,535
Call Dad.

533
01:03:09,665 --> 01:03:13,460
How do you live in New York
and not have a single Percocet?

534
01:03:15,838 --> 01:03:18,966
-HeIIo?
-Stephan. Put Stephan on the line.

535
01:03:19,091 --> 01:03:20,926
-Who is this?
-lt's Meg.

536
01:03:21,802 --> 01:03:23,428
Do you know what time it is?

537
01:03:23,846 --> 01:03:27,099
-Put him on the phone, bitch.
-It's your fucking wife.

538
01:03:31,103 --> 01:03:32,062
Move.

539
01:03:34,231 --> 01:03:36,567
-HeIIo?
-You've got to help us.

540
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:37,609
Move!

541
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:41,113
There are three men upstairs.
They broke in--

542
01:03:44,533 --> 01:03:45,450
What--

543
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,551
-He'll do something.
-No, he won't.

544
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:04,178
He'll call the police.

545
01:04:04,428 --> 01:04:06,471
You don't know her. She won't let him.

546
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:10,100
No. He knows that there's trouble.
He heard me.

547
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:14,271
He's across the park. That's why
we got houses close to each other.

548
01:04:14,396 --> 01:04:16,815
Just in case we needed each other.
He'll help us.

549
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:19,193
-He won't.
-Yes, he will!

550
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:26,491
l'm sorry.

551
01:04:27,075 --> 01:04:28,911
No, l'm sorry.

552
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:31,079
Why?

553
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:34,458
l was trying not to tell you.

554
01:04:35,709 --> 01:04:36,668
What?

555
01:04:37,377 --> 01:04:39,296
l'm dizzy and hungry.

556
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:45,802
All she's got is NyQuil and fucking Midol.

557
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:50,724
Looks like that gas idea
didn't work so well.

558
01:04:51,475 --> 01:04:52,851
Whose fault was that?

559
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,353
This is impossible.

560
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:56,230
What's the plan now, hot rod?

561
01:04:56,355 --> 01:04:59,024
This is worse than impossible.
This is unpleasant.

562
01:05:01,151 --> 01:05:03,904
Here, drink this.
All right, drink lots of water.

563
01:05:04,613 --> 01:05:07,991
You dropped to the low 40s.
We have to get your blood-sugar up.

564
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:09,576
Can you hear me okay?

565
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:11,453
l'm just dizzy, not deaf.

566
01:05:12,454 --> 01:05:14,623
Great. Smart ass. That's excellent.

567
01:05:14,748 --> 01:05:19,002
Did you see anything in here?
Any candy bars or something sweet?

568
01:05:19,628 --> 01:05:20,796
Let's check it again.

569
01:05:20,921 --> 01:05:22,297
Mom, l did it.

570
01:05:22,673 --> 01:05:24,550
We got to stay calm, okay?

571
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:27,845
lf we stay calm, everything will be fine.
All right? Stay calm.

572
01:05:27,928 --> 01:05:29,471
You're making me nervous.

573
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,348
l'm sorry.

574
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:34,518
What if l keep dropping?

575
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:38,647
You won't. l'll figure something out.

576
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,943
You know, he's right.

577
01:05:43,902 --> 01:05:46,154
There's no way
we're getting into that room.

578
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:47,823
What are you talking about?

579
01:05:49,283 --> 01:05:52,077
l just got to be honest with myself here.

580
01:05:52,786 --> 01:05:54,496
l don't need to be involved...

581
01:05:54,621 --> 01:05:58,417
...with anything so harrowing
or perilous at this point in my life.

582
01:05:58,500 --> 01:06:01,378
-You're giving up?
-Hell, yes.

583
01:06:01,628 --> 01:06:05,257
l don't need the fucking aggravation.
l'll make an anonymous phone call.

584
01:06:05,382 --> 01:06:09,511
They'll find the floor safe. l'll inherit.

585
01:06:10,596 --> 01:06:12,431
Stephen, Jeffrey, Catherine, David.

586
01:06:12,681 --> 01:06:16,059
Five grandkids, 60 percent inheritance tax.

587
01:06:16,226 --> 01:06:20,355
Fuck, l'll still put away 8 or 900 grand
and keep my goddamn hair.

588
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:24,276
Take it. Go out and get loaded.

589
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,945
Wait a minute.

590
01:06:27,988 --> 01:06:30,115
Say what you just said again.

591
01:06:36,038 --> 01:06:38,790
Say that shit about the money
again, babycakes.

592
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:43,378
When? Before?

593
01:06:43,712 --> 01:06:45,005
Yeah, before.

594
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:48,800
Splitting the money in your head,
you said you'd put away 800 or 900 grand.

595
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:51,845
What are you doing?

596
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:55,933
That was after tax, which makes it more
than a million and a half gross.

597
01:06:57,267 --> 01:06:59,686
So now you're a tax attorney.

598
01:07:02,481 --> 01:07:05,609
-l'm out of here.
-Wait a minute.

599
01:07:05,943 --> 01:07:10,322
There's sugar in everything.
Places you'd never expect. Like ketchup.

600
01:07:10,572 --> 01:07:11,990
Where else?

601
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:16,578
Travel kit.

602
01:07:16,703 --> 01:07:19,456
Plus, you named eight people
you got to split it with...

603
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:22,084
...so that's 10 or 12 million bucks
in the safe.

604
01:07:22,292 --> 01:07:25,420
A fuck-up like you has got to get less
than everybody else...

605
01:07:25,546 --> 01:07:27,506
...so now l don't know what to think.

606
01:07:27,965 --> 01:07:30,467
You're adding up money
you'll never touch, buddy.

607
01:07:31,593 --> 01:07:33,512
How much is in there?

608
01:07:35,722 --> 01:07:37,140
Mouthwash.

609
01:07:38,058 --> 01:07:38,976
Saccharin.

610
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:44,565
Hey, l'm talking to you. Answer me.

611
01:07:45,065 --> 01:07:46,441
Fine. There's more.

612
01:07:47,276 --> 01:07:50,279
And when were you going to tell us
this minor economic detail?

613
01:07:50,404 --> 01:07:52,781
lt doesn't matter now.
lt's totally fucking moot!

614
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:56,743
-Why are we having this conversation?
-What were you thinking?

615
01:07:56,869 --> 01:07:59,288
How did you expect to get away with this?

616
01:07:59,413 --> 01:08:01,498
Did you think that l'd open that safe...

617
01:08:01,623 --> 01:08:04,918
...and then me and Raoul would wait
while you picked out your share?

618
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:07,713
What's the matter with you?

619
01:08:07,796 --> 01:08:10,841
You got us into this mess,
and you were going to fuck us?

620
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:14,511
You got yourself into this.
You got the custody lawyers up your ass.

621
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:17,389
Your eyes were huge
when l told you about the gig...

622
01:08:17,472 --> 01:08:18,891
...so don't play innocent.

623
01:08:19,516 --> 01:08:21,476
Things didn't work out.

624
01:08:22,936 --> 01:08:24,521
Play past it.

625
01:08:29,526 --> 01:08:31,737
Mints? Sugar-free.

626
01:08:31,778 --> 01:08:32,487
Mints? Sugar-free.

627
01:08:32,613 --> 01:08:36,116
l'm opening that safe.
You leave, you get nothing.

628
01:08:36,283 --> 01:08:38,118
lt's looking doubtful there, big guy.

629
01:08:38,243 --> 01:08:42,039
l will split the money with Raoul.
But l don't ever want to see you again.

630
01:08:42,164 --> 01:08:45,876
Cops show up on my doorstep,
we will know who sent them...

631
01:08:46,126 --> 01:08:48,212
...and we will fucking find you.

632
01:08:52,716 --> 01:08:54,092
l'll see you, Burnham.

633
01:08:55,385 --> 01:08:56,595
Later, Raoul.

634
01:09:02,851 --> 01:09:04,061
Mom!

635
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:16,114
Ride in a Town Car to 125th Street
a couple of times...

636
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:18,408
...think you know all about it.

637
01:09:21,203 --> 01:09:23,455
You don't know nothing about me.

638
01:09:24,748 --> 01:09:27,501
Sarah, listen to me:

639
01:09:27,876 --> 01:09:30,587
Go to the corner. Shut your eyes
and don't turn around.

640
01:09:30,671 --> 01:09:31,755
Okay.

641
01:09:36,468 --> 01:09:38,804
You should see the look on your face.

642
01:09:40,305 --> 01:09:41,473
What's happening?

643
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,060
-Don't move. Don't you fucking move.
-No, don't.

644
01:09:45,269 --> 01:09:46,520
Come here.

645
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:47,980
Come here.

646
01:09:48,313 --> 01:09:50,983
-Don't shoot, please.
-Come on.

647
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:55,487
Shut it, lock it
and get the fuck away from it.

648
01:10:01,702 --> 01:10:04,162
-Stop it, you fucking--
-Fucking what?

649
01:10:04,621 --> 01:10:07,833
Clown? ldiot? Fucking asshole?

650
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:11,170
Who's the clown now?

651
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:12,296
Me.

652
01:10:12,588 --> 01:10:13,839
That's right.

653
01:10:14,381 --> 01:10:16,133
lt's burning me.

654
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:17,634
Who's got the gun?

655
01:10:18,468 --> 01:10:19,386
You.

656
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:21,638
Remember that.

657
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:24,850
Find out who the fuck that is.

658
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:30,147
Give me your wallet.

659
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:32,900
Give me your wallet.

660
01:10:37,738 --> 01:10:39,364
Stephan Altman.

661
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:48,832
Did your wife give you a call, Stephan?

662
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,003
What did she say?

663
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:58,050
Don't know. Cut off.

664
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:00,886
-Phones are dead.
-Did you call anybody else?

665
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:06,225
Did you call the fucking cops, Stephan?

666
01:11:09,895 --> 01:11:10,729
No.

667
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:12,981
He's telling the truth.

668
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:15,275
Yeah.

669
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,152
Yeah, he probably is.

670
01:11:17,819 --> 01:11:20,239
Because when l do this, people don't lie.

671
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:21,657
What?

672
01:11:22,824 --> 01:11:25,202
-What do you want?
-Get us into that room.

673
01:11:25,369 --> 01:11:26,745
-l can't.
-Yeah, you can.

674
01:11:27,579 --> 01:11:30,749
You're full of ideas.
You just got to squeeze one out.

675
01:11:30,874 --> 01:11:32,876
You want me to just make something up?

676
01:11:33,210 --> 01:11:35,128
You've got till the count of three.

677
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:37,714
Then you end up like Junior over there.

678
01:11:40,551 --> 01:11:42,970
-One, squeeze.
-This is ridiculous.

679
01:11:43,095 --> 01:11:44,179
Two, squeeze.

680
01:11:44,304 --> 01:11:45,889
l don't know what to tell you.

681
01:11:45,973 --> 01:11:47,140
-Three.
-Wait!

682
01:11:47,891 --> 01:11:48,976
Okay.

683
01:11:51,770 --> 01:11:53,397
l got an idea.

684
01:11:58,193 --> 01:11:59,069
Maybe.

685
01:12:00,779 --> 01:12:01,613
Maybe.

686
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:05,200
HeIpI Rubber SouI...

687
01:12:05,409 --> 01:12:08,912
...Yesterday and Today,
MagicaI Mystery Tour, The White AIbum....

688
01:12:08,996 --> 01:12:12,291
Stay warm, baby. Stay warm, all right?

689
01:12:13,667 --> 01:12:17,713
Let It Be, RevoIver, Sgt. pepper....

690
01:12:18,172 --> 01:12:18,964
Oh, god!

691
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:24,428
Dad?

692
01:12:24,511 --> 01:12:25,721
No, no.

693
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:39,610
Take it easy.

694
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:42,821
Open the door! Open the door!

695
01:12:47,659 --> 01:12:48,702
No.

696
01:12:51,079 --> 01:12:53,123
Don't open the door!

697
01:12:57,044 --> 01:12:59,880
-Just make it look good.
-Don't you tell me what--

698
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,595
Open the door!

699
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:08,847
Don't open--

700
01:13:15,270 --> 01:13:16,897
Knock it off!

701
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:20,108
You kill him, they'll never open that door.

702
01:13:30,202 --> 01:13:31,161
Oh, god.

703
01:13:31,703 --> 01:13:34,498
All right. Lie down. Lie down.

704
01:13:34,831 --> 01:13:35,999
Lie down.

705
01:13:37,459 --> 01:13:38,418
All right.

706
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:43,966
You'll be fine. Come on.

707
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:46,260
He's fucking crazy.

708
01:13:46,385 --> 01:13:49,221
Get your hands off him,
you frightening hillbilly motherfucker!

709
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:51,473
You're a strong girl.

710
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:54,977
You be strong. Be strong, sweetheart.

711
01:13:57,604 --> 01:14:00,482
Get the fuck off him, now!
Just get off him!

712
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:02,568
lt's almost over.

713
01:14:07,614 --> 01:14:09,575
Yeah, that's it. That's it.

714
01:14:31,054 --> 01:14:33,432
All right, turn around.

715
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:37,352
l'll be right back.

716
01:15:58,934 --> 01:16:01,728
lt's got blood on it.
You might want to wear it inside out.

717
01:16:01,854 --> 01:16:02,938
Get your tapes.

718
01:16:21,832 --> 01:16:23,250
Who's this?

719
01:16:27,796 --> 01:16:29,089
lt's her kid.

720
01:16:30,549 --> 01:16:32,009
What happened to her?

721
01:16:33,594 --> 01:16:35,888
Who gives a fuck?

722
01:17:04,208 --> 01:17:06,418
Hurry up. Get your stuff.

723
01:17:40,202 --> 01:17:41,662
Hey, lady.

724
01:17:45,832 --> 01:17:46,750
Mom?

725
01:17:52,089 --> 01:17:53,590
What are you doing?

726
01:17:56,176 --> 01:17:57,970
What are you doing?

727
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:09,439
We've got your kid.

728
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,408
Come down here.

729
01:18:22,661 --> 01:18:24,246
Let's get this over with.

730
01:18:31,295 --> 01:18:32,754
Get her, get her!

731
01:18:43,515 --> 01:18:44,683
Shit!

732
01:18:55,402 --> 01:18:56,320
What happened?

733
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:58,447
No! Let her out!

734
01:19:01,366 --> 01:19:03,076
-Where's your gun?
-Open the door.

735
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:04,494
No!

736
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:08,540
-Where's your gun?
-l don't know.

737
01:19:08,665 --> 01:19:10,209
Open up!

738
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:13,754
Open it.

739
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:21,512
Shut up! Listen to me.
She's got your gun.

740
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:24,139
She's got your gun!

741
01:19:25,807 --> 01:19:28,268
Stop screaming. Stop it.

742
01:19:47,371 --> 01:19:49,081
l know you've got the gun.

743
01:19:49,414 --> 01:19:52,000
put the gun down
and step away from the door.

744
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:58,882
You got to open the door.
My daughter is very sick.

745
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:01,051
She needs an injection.

746
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:03,428
Do you hear me?

747
01:20:03,804 --> 01:20:06,098
Open the door so l can give her a shot.

748
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:09,726
Or l swear to God, l'll kill you both.

749
01:20:10,394 --> 01:20:12,604
lf l open the door, you'll shoot us.

750
01:20:14,314 --> 01:20:16,900
So give her the shot yourself.

751
01:20:18,277 --> 01:20:20,070
Give her the shotI

752
01:20:32,499 --> 01:20:33,792
Do you need this?

753
01:20:37,921 --> 01:20:39,631
Can you do this yourself?

754
01:20:45,304 --> 01:20:47,347
What happens if you don't get it?

755
01:20:48,807 --> 01:20:50,142
Coma.

756
01:20:51,768 --> 01:20:52,728
Die.

757
01:20:57,608 --> 01:20:58,901
Fuck! Open it.

758
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:07,284
put the gun on the fIoor.
And go aII the way downstairs.

759
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:09,912

764
01:22:01,755 --> 01:22:03,006
Do you hear me?

01:22:04,508 --> 01:22:07,427
lf you step outside, l'll kill her!

766
01:22:08,303 --> 01:22:13,600
If I see a uniform inside this house,
I'II cut her fucking throatI

767
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:15,686
Do you understand?

768
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:22,651
Yes.

769
01:22:27,406 --> 01:22:29,491
But please, just give her the shot.

770
01:22:30,450 --> 01:22:31,326
Please.

771
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:34,830
pIease.

772
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:39,793
Don't fucking do it.

773
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:42,796
While we're in here, she'll call the cops.

774
01:22:42,963 --> 01:22:44,882
Are you going to open the safe?

775
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:52,264
Don't you look at me.

776
01:23:05,068 --> 01:23:07,487
All l know about this is what l see on TV.

777
01:23:07,613 --> 01:23:09,531
You got to talk me through this.

778
01:23:16,622 --> 01:23:17,915
This right here?

779
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,168
lt's this?

780
01:23:27,007 --> 01:23:28,091
Yeah, okay.

781
01:23:36,266 --> 01:23:38,143
Nice house you guys got.

782
01:23:38,852 --> 01:23:40,395
Your mom's rich.

783
01:23:43,023 --> 01:23:46,318
Dad's rich. Mom's just mad.

784
01:23:59,873 --> 01:24:01,166
Tap it.

785
01:24:16,598 --> 01:24:20,352
l wish l could have put my kid in
a place like this.

786
01:24:21,520 --> 01:24:23,272
lt's not that l didn't try.

787
01:24:23,438 --> 01:24:27,109
Sometimes things, they don't work out
the way you want them to.

788
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:32,072
Done.

789
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:35,826
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

790
01:24:36,994 --> 01:24:38,704
He had it all worked out.

791
01:24:39,329 --> 01:24:41,582
Nobody was supposed to even be here.

792
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:45,586
Thanks...

793
01:24:46,962 --> 01:24:48,005
...Burnham.

794
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:55,804
Wasn't supposed to be like this.

795
01:25:00,434 --> 01:25:01,977
She's going to be okay.

796
01:25:02,936 --> 01:25:05,314
I gave her the shot. She's aII right.

797
01:25:05,981 --> 01:25:07,608
It'II be over soon.

798
01:25:26,877 --> 01:25:27,836
Stephan.

799
01:25:31,465 --> 01:25:33,050
Oh, my god.

800
01:25:36,303 --> 01:25:37,846
Can you move?

801
01:25:38,805 --> 01:25:42,267
Not much. l think my arm is broken.

802
01:26:02,621 --> 01:26:03,914
Raise your arm.

803
01:26:04,623 --> 01:26:06,291
Come on, raise your arm.

804
01:26:24,476 --> 01:26:25,811
Try again.

805
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:28,522
Come on. Try again.

806
01:26:30,607 --> 01:26:34,319
Meg, please don't do anything stupid.

807
01:26:37,030 --> 01:26:39,157
They're going to kill us.

808
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:42,077
Just do everything they ask.
lt'll be okay that way.

809
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:44,997
Stephan, they'll kill her.

810
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:01,722
Holy shit. She called the goddamn cops.

811
01:27:01,972 --> 01:27:03,307
The police.

812
01:27:04,308 --> 01:27:05,684
You called the police?

813
01:27:05,767 --> 01:27:07,603
Of course, l called them.

814
01:27:08,187 --> 01:27:09,730
You scared the shit out of me.

815
01:27:09,855 --> 01:27:11,398
She killed the kid.

816
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:14,651
She just killed her own kid.

817
01:27:15,694 --> 01:27:17,154
All right, take this.

818
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,823
Don't say a word.

819
01:27:24,995 --> 01:27:26,997
No, her husband must have called them.

820
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,875
Foreign son of a bitch. l told you!

821
01:27:31,084 --> 01:27:32,836
Where is she?

822
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,050
There.

823
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:40,886
What the fuck's she doing?

824
01:27:57,569 --> 01:27:59,238
She's going to handle it.

825
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:05,369
l'm just trying to unlock....

826
01:28:11,667 --> 01:28:14,628
-ls everything okay?
-You all right, ma'am?

827
01:28:15,796 --> 01:28:18,924
What are you.... What time is it?

828
01:28:20,676 --> 01:28:22,302
lt's a little after 4:00 a.m.

829
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,221
We got a call, ma'am.

830
01:28:25,472 --> 01:28:26,890
Somebody called you?

831
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:29,935
Can we come in?

832
01:28:30,310 --> 01:28:31,603
What do you want?

833
01:28:31,728 --> 01:28:34,898
-We'd like to come in.
-No, you can't come in.

834
01:28:35,399 --> 01:28:37,276
Ma'am, you sure you're all right?

835
01:28:38,068 --> 01:28:39,236
l'm fine.

836
01:28:40,612 --> 01:28:42,489
Ma'am, you don't look so good.

837
01:28:50,873 --> 01:28:54,376
Well, you don't look so hot yourself,
Officer Keeney.

838
01:28:56,670 --> 01:28:58,589
Come on, l'm freezing out here.

839
01:29:01,508 --> 01:29:02,801
''There are three.''

840
01:29:04,344 --> 01:29:05,179
What?

841
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:08,557
Your husband said you called for help.

842
01:29:09,016 --> 01:29:12,561
That you said, ''There are three''
right before you got cut off.

843
01:29:16,190 --> 01:29:17,816
Oh, that phone call.

844
01:29:18,192 --> 01:29:20,277
And your neighbors...

845
01:29:20,402 --> 01:29:25,157
...called in about some loud shouts
or a loudspeaker of some kind?

846
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:29,953
That was the TV. lt's off now.

847
01:29:31,330 --> 01:29:34,917
Can l just ask you one question?

848
01:29:35,876 --> 01:29:38,337
What was the end of that sentence?

849
01:29:41,298 --> 01:29:43,467
When you said, ''There are three''...

850
01:29:44,718 --> 01:29:46,136
...what was the rest?

851
01:29:50,849 --> 01:29:51,767
Look....

852
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:57,648
My husband and l just split up...

853
01:29:58,315 --> 01:30:01,693
...and it's my first night in a new house...

854
01:30:03,111 --> 01:30:05,280
...and l admit l was a little drunk.

855
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:10,035
And the sentence,
if you insist on knowing...

856
01:30:11,286 --> 01:30:12,746
...was going to be:

857
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:19,711
''There are three things that l'll do for you
if you come jump into bed with me.''

858
01:30:23,715 --> 01:30:28,554
Thank God l came to my senses
before l said all that, and l hung up...

859
01:30:29,263 --> 01:30:32,349
...so nobody would ever have to know
what l was thinking.

860
01:30:32,432 --> 01:30:33,892
Unless, of course...

861
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:38,480
...two policemen came in the middle
of the night and interrogated me.

862
01:30:42,860 --> 01:30:44,570
So, Rick, you want to go?

863
01:30:45,153 --> 01:30:47,948
Or do you want her to tell you
which three things?

864
01:30:52,369 --> 01:30:53,370
All right.

865
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:54,705
Ma'am...

866
01:30:58,292 --> 01:31:01,003
...if there's something you want
to say to us...

867
01:31:02,212 --> 01:31:05,757
...but maybe you can't say it right now...

868
01:31:08,385 --> 01:31:11,263
...you might want to make some kind
of a signal...

869
01:31:11,597 --> 01:31:14,766
...by blinking your eyes a few times.

870
01:31:16,393 --> 01:31:18,103
Something like that.

871
01:31:21,732 --> 01:31:25,277
That's something you could do safely.

872
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:36,079
Man...

873
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:39,333
...you guys are good.

874
01:31:41,126 --> 01:31:44,755
You mean, like if there was somebody
in the house or something?

875
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:49,259
They really train you guys.

876
01:31:53,222 --> 01:31:55,682
No, l'm fine. l'm fine. Cross my heart.

877
01:32:05,359 --> 01:32:07,486
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

878
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:09,655
'Night, ma'am.

879
01:32:23,710 --> 01:32:25,379
