1 
00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:40,066 
Jen! 

2 
00:35:47,435 --> 00:35:48,311 
Are you OK? 

3 
00:35:50,155 --> 00:35:52,111 
You have plans for Russell? 

4 
00:35:54,035 --> 00:35:55,388 
I am. 

5 
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:59,825 
- You had to finish yesterday. 
- I have been delayed. 

6 
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:01,992 
You can not afford you. 

7 
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:03,903 
Doug, I ... 

8 
00:36:05,435 --> 00:36:07,073 
I do not feel well. 

9 
00:36:08,755 --> 00:36:10,507 
I always those dreams. 

10 
00:36:13,315 --> 00:36:16,705 
I will tell them 
That we need more time. 

11 
00:37:13,955 --> 00:37:17,914 
- I forget thee. You are returned alone? 
- Brian brought me back. 

12 
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:20,784 
We must call. 

13 
00:37:21,635 --> 00:37:23,910 
- I can go alone. 
- No problem. 

14 
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:28,390 
- You talk college? 
- Yes. 

15 
00:37:28,915 --> 00:37:30,826 
- Where? 
- In California. 

16 
00:37:31,555 --> 00:37:33,147 
You talked about Stroudsburg. 

17 
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:35,104 
No, you. 

18 
00:37:36,315 --> 00:37:40,467 
It's a good college, Kevin. 
And it's not far from here. I do not see ... 

19 
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:42,434 
I want to remain here. 

20 
00:37:43,275 --> 00:37:44,230 
Okay? 

21 
00:37:49,515 --> 00:37:52,154 
The brother of Brian 
Sold his old van. 

22 
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:55,510 
Old? 

23 
00:37:55,795 --> 00:37:59,788 
1991. It sells $ 1200. 
She 215000 km. 

24 
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:02,305 
- I submit to the state. 
- 1991? 

25 
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:05,066 
Papa and you were in agreement. 

26 
00:38:05,755 --> 00:38:07,632 
215000 km ... 

27 
00:38:10,155 --> 00:38:12,510 
Another year and I am breaking from here. 

28 
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:16,905 
- I have to go. 
- Agreed. 

29 
00:38:17,315 --> 00:38:19,624 
- Goodbye, Mrs. Cole. 
- Au revoir, Brian. 

30 
00:38:24,915 --> 00:38:26,473 
What will not? 

31 
00:38:28,395 --> 00:38:29,589 
It's your dreams? 

32 
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:32,910 
Every night for weeks. 

33 
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,547 
And now, at the office. 

34 
00:38:36,115 --> 00:38:39,027 
It is not normal 
Dream in broad daylight. 

35 
00:38:40,715 --> 00:38:42,433 
I do well in math. 

36 
00:38:48,035 --> 00:38:50,265 
It's my money, Mom. 

37 
00:39:00,355 --> 00:39:03,427 
After trying 
For so many years. 

38 
00:39:04,395 --> 00:39:07,592 
- I thought there more. 
- Me either. 

39 
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:10,870 
How? 

40 
00:39:12,355 --> 00:39:13,788 
Six weeks. 

41 
00:39:14,995 --> 00:39:16,633 
It's incredible. 

42 
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:24,226 
- They wanted a second! 
- When Kevin was 3 years old. 

43 
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,672 
It took a little time. 

44 
00:39:27,955 --> 00:39:30,674 
C'est tout ce que tu me dis? 

45 
00:39:31,555 --> 00:39:33,352 
What do you want me to tell you? 

46 
00:39:34,235 --> 00:39:35,953 
What was not anticipated? 

47 
00:39:36,155 --> 00:39:38,111 
We will organize. 

48 
00:39:38,555 --> 00:39:40,386 
Our life will change. 

49 
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:44,950 
The important thing 
It is to keep a cool head. 

50 
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:47,467 
It does not t'angoisse? 

51 
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:51,504 
What m'angoisse, 
It is the future of our business. 

52 
00:39:52,315 --> 00:39:54,510 
It is preparing for the past 20 years. 

53 
00:39:54,795 --> 00:39:59,266 
And it was 8 months for it. 
If we do not make it, it jeopardises 

54 
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:03,025 
Kevin college, 
The new baby and the rest. 

55 
00:40:05,435 --> 00:40:06,390 
Sleep, dear. 

56 
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:26,344 
Look Mommy, 1 shilling! 
I worked longer. 

57 
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,673 
So, we arrive late. 

58 
00:41:28,955 --> 00:41:30,707 
I have 2 pence more. 

59 
00:41:32,995 --> 00:41:35,429 
Keeps 2 pence. 
Cache them. 

60 
00:41:37,395 --> 00:41:38,908 
The not candy. 

61 
00:41:39,475 --> 00:41:42,387 
Sonny, you worked hard. 
It's your money. 

62 
00:41:42,595 --> 00:41:44,267 
I want you to give. 

63 
00:41:46,155 --> 00:41:47,270 
Okay. 

64 
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:03,953 
She looked me. 

65 
00:42:05,355 --> 00:42:07,471 
I must be crazy, Mom. 

66 
00:42:08,555 --> 00:42:11,831 
But no, you are not crazy. 
You are pregnant. 

67 
00:42:15,555 --> 00:42:17,068 
I saw it ... 

68 
00:42:17,475 --> 00:42:18,908 
Hallucination. 

69 
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:21,994 
A church. 

70 
00:42:23,315 --> 00:42:24,987 
In Ireland, I think. 

71 
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:33,866 
Child, you dreamed of Ireland. 

72 
00:42:34,075 --> 00:42:35,827 
Thou shalt not talking might say. 

73 
00:42:36,315 --> 00:42:39,193 
Your family Irish 
Exaspérait your father. 

74 
00:42:39,395 --> 00:42:41,511 
With school, the dreams stopped. 

75 
00:42:44,875 --> 00:42:46,467 
Your Irish city. 

76 
00:42:48,955 --> 00:42:50,707 
You draw cards. 

77 
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:53,388 
I kept. 

78 
00:42:55,675 --> 00:42:58,872 
Tu was only 6 years 
When you designed it. 

79 
00:43:31,595 --> 00:43:33,870 
It prepares the paperwork. 

80 
00:43:35,595 --> 00:43:37,347 
Where's Daddy? II was to come. 

81 
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:40,069 
He had to go 
On the site of Owen. 

82 
00:43:41,915 --> 00:43:42,984 
Super, eh? 

83 
00:43:45,235 --> 00:43:46,714 
I have 1200 dollars, 

84 
00:43:46,995 --> 00:43:48,986 
But I will borrow 

85 
00:43:49,275 --> 00:43:52,267 
Approximately $ 400 
To change parts. 

86 
00:43:53,915 --> 00:43:57,351 
Kevin, it was something unexpected. 
Our budget will be tight. 

87 
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:05,674 
I bought anyway. 

88 
00:44:18,595 --> 00:44:19,664 
How unexpected? 

89 
00:44:24,235 --> 00:44:25,304 
A baby. 

90 
00:44:27,475 --> 00:44:28,225 
What? 

91 
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:30,594 
I am pregnant. 

92 
00:44:34,115 --> 00:44:35,309 
You gutters? 

93 
00:44:35,715 --> 00:44:37,785 
I know the past 2 days. 

94 
00:44:40,035 --> 00:44:41,707 
You are going to be big brother. 

95 
00:44:43,035 --> 00:44:43,865 
Super! 

96 
00:44:44,075 --> 00:44:46,828 
- Kevin! The papers ... 
- Super ... 

97 
00:44:48,235 --> 00:44:50,544 
- That's it? 
- Keep. 

98 
00:44:51,915 --> 00:44:52,870 
Well ... 

99 
00:45:00,035 --> 00:45:00,990 
Go Sonny! 

100 
00:45:04,755 --> 00:45:06,427 
Faster! 

101 
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:17,347 
Va raise the trap. 

102 
00:45:21,915 --> 00:45:22,904 
Quick! 

103 
00:45:51,475 --> 00:45:52,305 
So? 

104 
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:03,228 
I must kill him. 

105 
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:05,711 
You have taken one or not? 

106 
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,983 
What do you do, 
Good God? 

107 
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:13,148 
What should I do? 

108 
00:46:13,955 --> 00:46:15,707 
I can not tell you. 

109 
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:19,547 
That was your trap. 
It is up to you to decide. 

110 
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:21,467 
It is up to you to decide. 

111 
00:46:37,475 --> 00:46:38,828 
Dépechons! 

112 
00:46:41,595 --> 00:46:42,630 
Go ... 

113 
00:46:44,515 --> 00:46:45,743 
File. 

114 
00:46:49,835 --> 00:46:51,507 
Tell no one. 

115 
00:46:51,995 --> 00:46:53,144 
If you. 

116 
00:46:53,915 --> 00:46:55,234 
Promis. 

117 
00:46:55,435 --> 00:46:56,550 
It is late! 

118 
00:46:57,195 --> 00:46:58,310 
Come! 

119 
00:46:59,595 --> 00:47:01,233 
And do not tell her to him. 

120 
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:04,428 
- Certainly not. 
- No, Sonny. Never. 

121 
00:47:05,435 --> 00:47:06,914 
In person. 

122 
00:47:07,915 --> 00:47:09,234 
Promis. 

123 
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:11,744 
Kevin, your mother a bizarre air. 

124 
00:47:18,995 --> 00:47:21,145 
Dr. Wickman told me that at age 42, 

125 
00:47:21,355 --> 00:47:23,744 
It is not as a mother to 24 years. 

126 
00:47:24,515 --> 00:47:27,632 
But pregnancy goes well, 
It is not worried. 

127 
00:47:27,835 --> 00:47:29,427 
You must be delighted. 

128 
00:47:29,635 --> 00:47:30,863 
- Yes. 
- Yes. 

129 
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:36,072 
Mom told me 
That your budget would be tight. 

130 
00:47:36,275 --> 00:47:39,312 
- I forget California, then? 
- Correct. 

131 
00:47:39,515 --> 00:47:43,474 
Super. The baby is not here yet 
It rots my life already. 

132 
00:47:43,675 --> 00:47:44,630 
Kevin! 

133 
00:47:44,915 --> 00:47:46,348 
This is not the end of the world. 

134 
00:47:46,675 --> 00:47:48,791 
- For me, though. 
- Enough. 

135 
00:47:53,835 --> 00:47:54,870 
Thank you. 

136 
00:47:57,315 --> 00:47:58,907 
Tu as he spoke of dreams? 

137 
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:02,187 
The doctor said 
It is common in my state. 

138 
00:48:04,275 --> 00:48:05,594 
But it is not that. 

139 
00:48:06,515 --> 00:48:09,951 
Listen, Jen, you will tie 
Too much importance. 

140 
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:14,265 
- Only dreams. 
- However, it looks like something else. 

141 
00:48:14,555 --> 00:48:16,671 
What do you see? 

142 
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:19,147 
It's always the same. 

143 
00:48:20,515 --> 00:48:22,585 
This family in Ireland. 

144 
00:48:23,635 --> 00:48:26,069 
I did never gone, but ... 

145 
00:48:26,355 --> 00:48:28,915 
- Where does it in Ireland? 
- But nowhere. 

146 
00:48:29,235 --> 00:48:30,714 
Where do you want to come? 

147 
00:48:31,915 --> 00:48:34,065 
In geography, Doug. 

148 
00:48:34,675 --> 00:48:36,427 
Very funny, Maggie. 

149 
00:48:36,755 --> 00:48:39,223 
Please, 
Did not cheer. 

150 
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:43,946 
Where do you think it is? 

151 
00:48:44,715 --> 00:48:46,194 
I do not know. 

152 
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,187 
You know what? 

153 
00:48:48,475 --> 00:48:51,148 
I will leave my Oui--ja. 
It can help? 

154 
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:54,269 
You realize how much 
It is ridiculous? 

155 
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:07,105 
Again. 

156 
00:49:14,515 --> 00:49:15,789 
Malahide? 

157 
00:49:31,795 --> 00:49:33,706 
Hello. I am Jenny Cole. 

158 
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:36,713 
I just try map 
I commanded. 

159 
00:49:37,275 --> 00:49:39,266 
Let me see. I return. 

160 
00:49:40,155 --> 00:49:41,224 
Pardon. 

161 
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:48,384 
Apparently, there are four children. 

162 
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:53,350 
Sonny is the oldest. 
It a. .. 12 or 13 years. 

163 
00:49:55,755 --> 00:49:58,223 
She loves her children ... 

164 
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:02,111 
But I sense something else ... 

165 
00:50:03,155 --> 00:50:04,634 
A misfortune. 

166 
00:50:06,995 --> 00:50:08,633 
- This is nonsense. 
- No. 

167 
00:50:08,835 --> 00:50:10,234 
But if! 

168 
00:50:10,435 --> 00:50:11,629 
I have. 

169 
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:16,827 
It is a detailed map 
Malahide and its environs. 

170 
00:50:24,595 --> 00:50:25,664 
Look. 

171 
00:50:27,675 --> 00:50:30,064 
The village. This is the same. 

172 
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:32,830 
The road ... 

173 
00:50:35,315 --> 00:50:36,509 
The church. 

174 
00:50:38,195 --> 00:50:39,150 
The station. 

175 
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:46,714 
Roads are identical. 

176 
00:50:47,555 --> 00:50:49,625 
Look, here Swords Road. 

177 
00:50:50,035 --> 00:50:51,309 
That's Malahide. 

178 
00:50:52,275 --> 00:50:54,231 
This design is about you? 

179 
00:50:55,555 --> 00:50:57,591 
Without knowing Malahide? 

180 
00:50:58,035 --> 00:50:58,990 
Not. 

181 
00:51:03,595 --> 00:51:04,630 
Excuse me. 

182 
00:51:07,675 --> 00:51:08,903 
It exists. 

183 
00:51:12,155 --> 00:51:14,066 
If Malahide exist ... 

184 
00:51:16,155 --> 00:51:18,430 
Who are these people that I see? 

185 
00:51:20,555 --> 00:51:22,068 
Are there too? 

186 
00:51:30,795 --> 00:51:31,830 
Oh. 

187 
00:51:32,475 --> 00:51:35,114 
A book by Dr. Christopher Garrison. 

188 
00:51:35,315 --> 00:51:38,113 
He teaches theology 
At the university. 

189 
00:51:38,315 --> 00:51:41,910 
- And it is hypnothérapeute. 
- It speaks of reincarnation. 

190 
00:51:42,875 --> 00:51:43,944 
No, Mom. 

191 
00:51:45,275 --> 00:51:47,311 
You have never been to Ireland. 

192 
00:51:47,595 --> 00:51:51,383 
Child, already, you count was 
Drawings. And it resumes. 

193 
00:51:51,595 --> 00:51:55,474 
Garrison said that it is not 
Dreams, but memories. 

194 
00:51:55,675 --> 00:51:56,949 
It's impossible. 

195 
00:51:57,595 --> 00:52:01,270 
I am not saying that I believe in it. 
But it could help 

196 
00:52:01,555 --> 00:52:03,466 
Explain what you feel. 

197 
00:52:08,355 --> 00:52:09,674 
I call you. 

198 
00:52:10,395 --> 00:52:11,908 
- Au revoir. 
- Au revoir. 

199 
00:52:30,075 --> 00:52:31,144 
Money! 

200 
00:52:42,995 --> 00:52:44,110 
It is where? 

201 
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:49,106 
I know you have the money. 
Give it to me, avorton! 

202 
00:52:49,395 --> 00:52:51,545 
- The neighbors hear. 
- Well, 

203 
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,666 
Swords Road m'entende that! 

204 
00:52:54,915 --> 00:52:56,906 
- This is a child! 
- The farm! 

205 
00:52:57,835 --> 00:52:58,790 
Let her! 

206 
00:53:07,795 --> 00:53:09,023 
You have! 

207 
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:11,710 
Huh? 

208 
00:53:12,635 --> 00:53:15,103 
Come on, give it to me. 

209 
00:53:17,475 --> 00:53:19,272 
Give it to me! 

210 
00:53:20,235 --> 00:53:21,554 
Money! 

211 
00:53:48,355 --> 00:53:49,629 
Are you OK, mom? 

212 
00:54:14,755 --> 00:54:16,950 
- Jen! Congratulations. 
- Thank you. 

213 
00:54:17,155 --> 00:54:20,989 
Let me take you in a store 
Who balance the layette. 

214 
00:54:21,195 --> 00:54:22,230 
Willingly. 

215 
00:54:28,795 --> 00:54:30,387 
You have missed the reunion. 

216 
00:54:30,675 --> 00:54:33,633 
Saturday Casey, the promoter 
5 which builds houses 

217 
00:54:33,915 --> 00:54:36,270 
And seeking its contractor. 

218 
00:54:36,555 --> 00:54:38,910 
- Do you remember? 
- Excuse me. 

219 
00:54:39,435 --> 00:54:40,663 
I called. 

220 
00:54:42,475 --> 00:54:43,590 
Where have you been? 

221 
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:46,947 
I need you here. 

222 
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:49,794 
We have to stall the contract. 

223 
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,270 
- I want to go see somebody. 
- Gary? 

224 
00:54:52,635 --> 00:54:56,548 
- Advanced Delivery is at 4. 
- No problem. 

225 
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:59,064 
Dr. Garrison, a hypnothérapeute. 

226 
00:54:59,275 --> 00:55:01,027 
- Check the measures. 
- Agreed. 

227 
00:55:01,235 --> 00:55:04,147 
It treats anxiety through hypnosis. 

228 
00:55:04,355 --> 00:55:07,347 
Wickman said that you are well. 
Forget those dreams. 

229 
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:08,510 
Souvenirs. 

230 
00:55:08,715 --> 00:55:11,673 
- What? 
- Garrison spoke of memories. 

231 
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,593 
From reincarnation. 

232 
00:55:15,235 --> 00:55:17,146 
Come in the office. 

233 
00:55:23,275 --> 00:55:26,233 
He has a doctorate in theology 
And psychology. 

234 
00:55:26,435 --> 00:55:30,394 
- And he believes in reincarnation? 
- He talks about past lives. 

235 
00:55:30,675 --> 00:55:33,508 
He speaks of senseless things. 

236 
00:55:37,475 --> 00:55:38,988 
I may be ... 

237 
00:55:40,595 --> 00:55:41,948 
Lrlandaise this. 

238 
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,947 
This mother. 

239 
00:55:45,955 --> 00:55:49,470 
But finally, Jen, you realize 
What you are saying now? 

240 
00:55:49,755 --> 00:55:51,632 
Whether you croies me. 

241 
00:55:52,195 --> 00:55:54,425 
You just need to understand that you 

242 
00:55:55,475 --> 00:55:57,670 
That I have to do. 

243 
00:56:09,995 --> 00:56:12,031 
OUR LIVES EARLIER 

244 
00:56:33,275 --> 00:56:34,867 
What have you said to Casey? 

245 
00:56:35,875 --> 00:56:37,513 
Whether you had a tile. 

246 
00:56:38,155 --> 00:56:40,874 
That there was no more reliable than you. 

247 
00:56:41,195 --> 00:56:43,106 
That high school already, 

248 
00:56:43,315 --> 00:56:45,749 
Always expecting you to leave. 

249 
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:48,426 
You thought I t'attendais? 

250 
00:56:56,675 --> 00:56:59,428 
Lls lived Swords Road. 

251 
00:57:00,075 --> 00:57:01,474 
The lrlandais. 

252 
00:57:05,155 --> 00:57:07,225 
I heard him in a dream. 

253 
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:11,829 
I checked. 

254 
00:57:12,115 --> 00:57:14,310 
Swords Road exists in Malahide. 

255 
00:57:17,075 --> 00:57:18,508 
How do I know? 

256 
00:57:18,995 --> 00:57:22,590 
I know nothing. 
But reincarnation ... 

257 
00:57:23,275 --> 00:57:25,311 
I come not believe it, Jen. 

258 
00:57:28,235 --> 00:57:30,749 
There has been a lot of work here. 

259 
00:57:33,395 --> 00:57:37,070 
If going to see this type 
Can help you forget all that, 

260 
00:57:37,635 --> 00:57:38,988 
Will be seen. 

261 
00:57:45,675 --> 00:57:47,631 
I go back to work. 

262 
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:00,108 
Unwind. 

263 
00:58:00,315 --> 00:58:03,625 
You have read my book, 
You know my method. 

264 
00:58:05,075 --> 00:58:09,114 
I filmed each meeting to 
To be able to come back and analyze it. 

265 
00:58:09,955 --> 00:58:13,994 
Sometimes, one thing seems 
Insignificant at first glance, 

266 
00:58:14,635 --> 00:58:17,149 
But it often 
A detail implausible 

267 
00:58:17,435 --> 00:58:19,266 
Which can be verified. 

268 
00:58:20,195 --> 00:58:21,947 
Ms. Cole ... 

269 
00:58:23,835 --> 00:58:26,349 
We need to know 
What you see, 

270 
00:58:26,715 --> 00:58:30,344 
What you feel. 
Then we can define 

271 
00:58:30,635 --> 00:58:33,866 
If it is true memories 

272 
00:58:34,155 --> 00:58:35,429 
Or not. 

273 
00:58:36,435 --> 00:58:37,504 
Let's go? 

274 
00:58:45,075 --> 00:58:47,908 
I will count backwards 
5 to 1. 

275 
00:58:51,155 --> 00:58:54,227 
At 1, you will not hear 
That my voice. 

276 
00:58:55,755 --> 00:58:57,234 
Five. 

277 
00:58:57,755 --> 00:58:59,029 
Farther. 

278 
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:00,829 
Four. 

279 
00:59:01,675 --> 00:59:03,074 
Okay. 

280 
00:59:03,395 --> 00:59:06,512 
Three. Still later. 

281 
00:59:07,075 --> 00:59:08,144 
Two. 

282 
00:59:09,075 --> 00:59:11,111 
You are almost. 

283 
00:59:12,835 --> 00:59:14,029 
Un 

284 
00:59:17,035 --> 00:59:18,912 
It returned to Ireland. 

285 
00:59:19,515 --> 00:59:23,713 
It dates from the time 
Of this life in Malahide. 

286 
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,343 
You are safe, Jenny. 

287 
00:59:29,395 --> 00:59:31,306 
- You are in Malahide? 
- Yes. 

288 
00:59:32,915 --> 00:59:35,713 
- You are alone? 
- No. 

289 
00:59:36,595 --> 00:59:37,550 
With whom? 

290 
00:59:38,915 --> 00:59:40,587 
Two of the children. 

291 
00:59:41,675 --> 00:59:43,711 
Is everything OK? 

292 
00:59:47,995 --> 00:59:49,633 
No, it will not. 

293 
00:59:51,595 --> 00:59:53,108 
There is a problem. 

294 
00:59:53,395 --> 00:59:55,147 
I will help you, Mom. 

295 
00:59:59,875 --> 01:00:02,435 
Sonny, is up to your sister. 

296 
01:00:08,115 --> 01:00:10,549 
- Are you OK, Brigdet? 
- Mary ... 

297 
01:00:11,835 --> 01:00:13,507 
Mary, it's not going to? 

298 
01:00:13,795 --> 01:00:16,150 
Mama! Elizabeth, quickly! 

299 
01:00:19,075 --> 01:00:21,669 
- J'étouffe ... 
- Mr. Mullen! 

300 
01:00:21,955 --> 01:00:23,434 
A glass of water! 

301 
01:00:30,275 --> 01:00:32,391 
This is surely a boy. 

302 
01:00:33,555 --> 01:00:35,466 
He agitated! 

303 
01:00:37,275 --> 01:00:38,344 
Ms. O'Neill. 

304 
01:00:40,035 --> 01:00:41,514 
Thank you. 

305 
01:00:44,355 --> 01:00:45,708 
Wood everything. 

306 
01:00:49,155 --> 01:00:51,146 
Five, four, 

307 
01:00:51,635 --> 01:00:53,944 
Three, two, 

308 
01:00:54,515 --> 01:00:55,664 
One. 

309 
01:01:02,795 --> 01:01:04,513 
Her name is Mary. 

310 
01:01:05,675 --> 01:01:06,869 
Yes. 

311 
01:01:08,075 --> 01:01:10,031 
She is also pregnant. 

312 
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:15,347 
I would like to schedule 
A series of meetings, 

313 
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:18,115 
If you agree 
To continue. 

314 
01:01:18,595 --> 01:01:21,348 
Worth to go further. 

315 
01:01:22,635 --> 01:01:24,865 
I propose Tuesday. 

316 
01:01:25,075 --> 01:01:27,111 
Mary O'Neill ... 

317 
01:01:33,835 --> 01:01:36,508 
The tuition is more expensive 
If we go out of the state. 

318 
01:01:36,715 --> 01:01:40,344 
All universities offer 
Multiple student loans. 

319 
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:44,548 
But it is not in a position 
Of debt at this time. 

320 
01:01:44,755 --> 01:01:48,907 
- You can spread the payments. 
- This is not a solution. 

321 
01:01:50,235 --> 01:01:53,193 
Kevin can pretend 
Certain scholarships. 

322 
01:01:53,395 --> 01:01:54,908 
It's an option. 

323 
01:01:55,515 --> 01:01:57,710 
- We can try. 
- Sure. 

324 
01:01:57,915 --> 01:02:00,349 
And maintenance? And journeys? 

325 
01:02:00,555 --> 01:02:04,434 
- It is already doing a lot. 
- Some scholarships 

326 
01:02:04,715 --> 01:02:07,024 
Include pension and trips. 

327 
01:02:07,235 --> 01:02:09,305 
We targeted these awards then. 

328 
01:02:11,155 --> 01:02:14,033 
First, 
Universities in the region. 

329 
01:02:14,315 --> 01:02:17,068 
I want to remain in the region. 

330 
01:02:17,355 --> 01:02:19,107 
I will find a job. 

331 
01:02:19,395 --> 01:02:21,465 
I will pay my schooling myself. 

332 
01:02:21,755 --> 01:02:24,713 
Ms. Cole, 
I understand your concern, 

333 
01:02:24,995 --> 01:02:27,873 
Kevin, but also 
Say. 

334 
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:30,631 
The west coast is a good choice. 

335 
01:02:44,275 --> 01:02:45,947 
It hurts! 

336 
01:03:01,155 --> 01:03:04,511 
- The Doctor is with you? 
- Yes. 

337 
01:03:04,795 --> 01:03:06,592 
It can help you? 

338 
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,547 
Come on, Mary, grows. 

339 
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,349 
That's it. 

340 
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:40,310 
A boy. 

341 
01:03:41,475 --> 01:03:42,669 
A boy! 

342 
01:03:53,275 --> 01:03:54,503 
It is blue. 

343 
01:03:55,395 --> 01:03:56,953 
While blue. 

344 
01:04:06,195 --> 01:04:07,150 
Sorry. 

345 
01:04:09,275 --> 01:04:11,266 
Oh, my baby ... 

346 
01:04:39,395 --> 01:04:42,944 
If she is pregnant again, 
She did not survive. 

347 
01:04:43,675 --> 01:04:45,825 
More child, John. 

348 
01:04:46,155 --> 01:04:49,670 
You have a beautiful family. 
Four children vigorous. 

349 
01:04:50,555 --> 01:04:52,432 
You can thank God. 

350 
01:05:17,595 --> 01:05:18,710 
Five, 

351 
01:05:20,035 --> 01:05:21,229 
Four, 

352 
01:05:22,195 --> 01:05:23,310 
Three, 

353 
01:05:24,755 --> 01:05:25,870 
Two, 

354 
01:05:27,515 --> 01:05:28,743 
One. 

355 
01:05:37,115 --> 01:05:39,231 
This is not possible! 

356 
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,834 
Everything is fine. 

357 
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:43,306 
Everything is fine, Jenny. 

358 
01:05:45,435 --> 01:05:49,826 
Listen, the strength and 
The depth of emotions 

359 
01:05:50,115 --> 01:05:52,913 
You feel 
Through this woman 

360 
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:57,313 
Lead me to think 
It has existed. 

361 
01:05:58,515 --> 01:06:01,268 
And you can discover 
Who she was ... 

362 
01:06:02,075 --> 01:06:03,827 
When she lived ... 

363 
01:06:04,635 --> 01:06:07,911 
Which connects your life 
In his past life. 

364 
01:06:09,195 --> 01:06:11,425 
These are not dreams. 

365 
01:06:13,435 --> 01:06:15,630 
These are your memories.

366 
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:47,513 
What has? 

367 
01:06:49,235 --> 01:06:51,032 
It was so small. 

368 
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:53,990 
The tiniest babies. 

369 
01:06:55,235 --> 01:06:56,668 
It was so sad. 

370 
01:06:57,075 --> 01:06:58,428 
What baby? 

371 
01:07:00,595 --> 01:07:02,313 
The Mary. 

372 
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:04,712 
It was stillborn. 

373 
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:09,068 
And it was in my arms. 

374 
01:07:13,995 --> 01:07:16,384 
I could feel his presence. 

375 
01:07:18,675 --> 01:07:21,428 
His death fendait me your heart. 

376 
01:07:23,195 --> 01:07:25,311 
As my own child. 

377 
01:07:27,715 --> 01:07:29,467 
Calm yourself, Jenny. 

378 
01:07:30,955 --> 01:07:32,911 
It was my son. 

379 
01:07:36,715 --> 01:07:38,945 
That was my life. 

380 
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:03,385 
Hi. 

381 
01:08:03,595 --> 01:08:06,155 
- Hi. 
- You do what? 

382 
01:08:06,435 --> 01:08:10,474 
I documented on Ireland 
I know when Mary lived. 

383 
01:08:13,195 --> 01:08:14,150 
Who is it? 

384 
01:08:18,195 --> 01:08:20,425 
Mary's daughter. Elizabeth. 

385 
01:08:21,715 --> 01:08:23,706 
When I was a little girl, 

386 
01:08:23,995 --> 01:08:26,463 
I called all my dolls 
Elizabeth. 

387 
01:08:27,835 --> 01:08:32,067 
- Your grandmother says. 
- It's really bizarre. 

388 
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:35,788 
Have you reincarnated? 

389 
01:08:39,035 --> 01:08:41,549 
I can not ignore 
Certain things. 

390 
01:08:43,715 --> 01:08:46,104 
But I find it difficult to understand. 

391 
01:08:48,155 --> 01:08:52,068 
Me too. 
But when you were children, 

392 
01:08:52,355 --> 01:08:54,311 
How you could draw that? 

393 
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:59,393 
Papa returned when? 
It is for my car. 

394 
01:08:59,595 --> 01:09:01,233 
Zut! I forgot. 

395 
01:09:02,515 --> 01:09:05,473 
The meeting with Sam Casey. 
I am late. 

396 
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:07,950 
- Hi. 
- Hi. 

397 
01:09:18,035 --> 01:09:20,868 
I want the same spirit 
At Fairview. 

398 
01:09:21,075 --> 01:09:21,905 
Okay. 

399 
01:09:22,115 --> 01:09:25,471 
But I want that all 
Be more modern. 

400 
01:09:25,675 --> 01:09:28,109 
Jenny offers 
Several fronts. 

401 
01:09:28,315 --> 01:09:31,432 
- Parfait. It continues? 
- I almost finished. 

402 
01:09:32,595 --> 01:09:36,031 
- How will the business? 
- It starts well. 

403 
01:09:36,235 --> 01:09:38,510 
That's fine, you be launched. 

404 
01:09:38,715 --> 01:09:41,104 
- It had to. 
- I know that. 

405 
01:09:41,315 --> 01:09:45,513 
At the moment, 
It has four worksites. 

406 
01:09:46,435 --> 01:09:47,424 
It goes far? 

407 
01:09:51,515 --> 01:09:53,153 
17 

408 
01:09:53,475 --> 01:09:56,433 
January, 

409 
01:09:56,795 --> 01:09:58,626 
1932. 

410 
01:09:58,835 --> 01:10:00,109 
Bravo, Geoffrey. 

411 
01:10:00,315 --> 01:10:02,909 
Stops, Frank. 
You are going to tear the hem. 

412 
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:05,071 
- No. 
- Si 

413 
01:10:05,355 --> 01:10:07,152 
You do all your coats. 

414 
01:10:07,435 --> 01:10:09,744 
- This is not true. 
- If it's true. 

415 
01:10:10,035 --> 01:10:12,833 
- Why you do that? 
- What? 

416 
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:28,514 
You do what? 

417 
01:10:29,115 --> 01:10:31,231 
The hem of the coat of Frank. 

418 
01:10:37,395 --> 01:10:39,625 
Come rather in the room. 

419 
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:46,230 
- I can not, John. 
- The coat can wait. 

420 
01:10:47,275 --> 01:10:49,231 
Pose your needle and just. 

421 
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:51,187 
No, John. 

422 
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:54,753 
- I told you to come. 
- And I said no! 

423 
01:10:55,035 --> 01:10:57,265 
- Do what I tell you! 
- Let her. 

424 
01:10:58,355 --> 01:10:59,629 
Sonny, no! 

425 
01:10:59,915 --> 01:11:00,950 
You ... 

426 
01:11:02,755 --> 01:11:04,746 
Do not make him evil! 

427 
01:11:10,195 --> 01:11:11,628 
No! Children! 

428 
01:11:11,915 --> 01:11:13,189 
Come! 

429 
01:11:13,675 --> 01:11:14,869 
I beg you! 

430 
01:11:42,955 --> 01:11:45,423 
Jenny, what has? 

431 
01:11:49,355 --> 01:11:51,471 
- What has? 
- It is not finished. 

432 
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:52,710 
What? 

433 
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,231 
What is not finished? 

434 
01:11:55,435 --> 01:11:59,223 
II knew she could no longer 
Have children. She will die. 

435 
01:11:59,435 --> 01:12:02,791 
It will not die. 
Listen. These people do not exist. 

436 
01:12:02,995 --> 01:12:06,192 
Even if they existed, 
They are already dead. 

437 
01:12:08,595 --> 01:12:12,270 
Not. 
They could still be alive. 

438 
01:12:13,435 --> 01:12:14,948 
How are you? 

439 
01:12:15,235 --> 01:12:18,307 
I heard Geoffrey said. 
That was in 1932. 

440 
01:12:19,435 --> 01:12:20,868 
Children ... 

441 
01:12:22,675 --> 01:12:24,472 
They may be alive. 

442 
01:12:40,075 --> 01:12:43,624 
Ah, yes. Thank you. 
Thank you for reminding me. 

443 
01:12:44,395 --> 01:12:47,671 
Not. It is not too late. 
I go to my office. 

444 
01:12:47,875 --> 01:12:48,830 
Who is it? 

445 
01:12:49,035 --> 01:12:52,072 
The pastor of the Church of St. Joseph, 
In Malahide. 

446 
01:12:52,875 --> 01:12:54,149 
Yes, Father Kelly. 

447 
01:12:55,395 --> 01:12:59,513 
I am trying to find a family 
Who has lived in Malahide circa 1930. 

448 
01:13:00,475 --> 01:13:02,033 
The O'Neill family. 

449 
01:13:02,435 --> 01:13:06,474 
The parents called John 
And Mary, they had 4 children. 

450 
01:13:07,435 --> 01:13:09,266 
I was told that in Ireland 

451 
01:13:09,555 --> 01:13:12,149 
Registers were kept 
In churches, 

452 
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:16,234 
And I hoped 
You may get information 

453 
01:13:16,515 --> 01:13:18,312 
On this family. 

454 
01:13:18,555 --> 01:13:19,510 
It is 3 h. 

455 
01:13:19,715 --> 01:13:22,149 
Can you send me an e--mail? 

456 
01:13:22,915 --> 01:13:23,745 
Jenny ... 

457 
01:13:24,075 --> 01:13:25,872 
You are not computerized. 

458 
01:13:26,955 --> 01:13:28,786 
Who can do research? 

459 
01:13:30,755 --> 01:13:32,871 
No, I understand my father. 

460 
01:13:33,595 --> 01:13:35,711 
Thanks anyway. 

461 
01:13:48,035 --> 01:13:49,309 
The courier. 

462 
01:14:04,275 --> 01:14:05,469 
What is it? 

463 
01:14:05,675 --> 01:14:09,748 
I wrote to O'Neill 14 
In the region of Malahide. 

464 
01:14:11,275 --> 01:14:13,630 
None of them knows Mary. 

465 
01:14:18,235 --> 01:14:20,954 
- You told them as your dreams? 
- No. 

466 
01:14:22,235 --> 01:14:24,430 
But I said that was important. 

467 
01:14:28,675 --> 01:14:31,985 
But then, 
Jenny you are or you are Mary? 

468 
01:14:32,315 --> 01:14:33,987 
That is what I believe: 

469 
01:14:34,875 --> 01:14:37,628 
I am the revival of Mary. 

470 
01:14:39,435 --> 01:14:42,871 
I was Mary, 
But today, I am Jenny. 

471 
01:14:45,515 --> 01:14:48,109 
- How she died? 
- I do not know. 

472 
01:14:49,755 --> 01:14:51,666 
But memories become clearer. 

473 
01:14:51,955 --> 01:14:54,310 
- Why? 
- According to Garrison, 

474 
01:14:54,875 --> 01:14:57,309 
Souls who rise quickly 

475 
01:14:58,275 --> 01:15:01,711 
Feel the need to complete 
What is left unfinished. 

476 
01:15:04,475 --> 01:15:06,830 
I know it concerns children. 

477 
01:15:08,555 --> 01:15:10,193 
But I do not know what. 

478 
01:15:38,275 --> 01:15:41,904 
He had a beautiful wife 

479 
01:15:44,275 --> 01:15:45,788 
A pretty woman 

480 
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:49,784 
She wanted a child 

481 
01:15:54,115 --> 01:15:57,346 
He had a beautiful child 

482 
01:15:57,795 --> 01:16:01,185 
He had a beautiful child. 

483 
01:16:02,915 --> 01:16:06,225 
I love it. 
And you sing so well. 

484 
01:16:06,515 --> 01:16:09,746 
- I like it too. 
- That is why you will sing! 

485 
01:16:11,675 --> 01:16:12,744 
Wait! 

486 
01:16:23,755 --> 01:16:25,507 
You should be extended. 

487 
01:16:25,755 --> 01:16:27,427 
We need rest. 

488 
01:16:31,235 --> 01:16:33,226 
No, I need my children. 

489 
01:16:36,875 --> 01:16:38,547 
It soon. 

490 
01:16:40,035 --> 01:16:41,787 
You are going to call it? 

491 
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,672 
Gregory for a boy ... 

492 
01:16:46,475 --> 01:16:48,033 
Phyllis for a girl. 

493 
01:16:49,235 --> 01:16:50,554 
Give me a sister. 

494 
01:16:51,435 --> 01:16:53,027 
I will try. 

495 
01:17:01,475 --> 01:17:02,590 
Sonny ... 

496 
01:17:04,555 --> 01:17:05,829 
If ever ... 

497 
01:17:07,355 --> 01:17:08,834 
Everything will be fine. 

498 
01:17:11,155 --> 01:17:12,873 
Thou shalt take care of them. 

499 
01:17:13,155 --> 01:17:14,383 
Stop. 

500 
01:17:15,035 --> 01:17:16,946 
Everything will go well. 

501 
01:17:17,995 --> 01:17:19,348 
You are the eldest. 

502 
01:17:20,595 --> 01:17:24,554 
Promise me that children 
Remain together. 

503 
01:17:35,315 --> 01:17:36,714 
Promis. 

504 
01:18:10,275 --> 01:18:11,469 
What has? 

505 
01:18:11,755 --> 01:18:13,507 
I got burned. 

506 
01:18:13,795 --> 01:18:16,753 
- I had their minds elsewhere. 
- Are you OK? 

507 
01:18:17,755 --> 01:18:21,225 
Mom ... 
She knew she was going to die. 

508 
01:18:22,635 --> 01:18:25,308 
What would leave 
With the animal. 

509 
01:18:26,595 --> 01:18:30,304 
She promised to Sonny 
To watch over the children. 

510 
01:18:34,075 --> 01:18:35,827 
Despite my research, 

511 
01:18:36,035 --> 01:18:38,754 
I can not 
To trace them. 

512 
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,427 
Excuse me. Hello. 

513 
01:18:46,675 --> 01:18:48,233 
You had to go? 

514 
01:18:48,715 --> 01:18:50,273 
I took 

515 
01:18:51,635 --> 01:18:53,307 
3 airfares. 

516 
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:56,553 
You will all go to Ireland. 

517 
01:18:57,475 --> 01:18:58,305 
What? 

518 
01:18:58,595 --> 01:19:02,190 
You have to finish. For you, 
But for Doug and Kevin. 

519 
01:19:03,355 --> 01:19:04,947 
They need you. 

520 
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:09,225 
You are right. I live in the past. 

521 
01:19:10,835 --> 01:19:12,427 
I am absent. 

522 
01:19:12,715 --> 01:19:15,468 
You are going to have a baby. 
You have to be there. 

523 
01:19:16,275 --> 01:19:20,951 
Find what happened to Mary 
And her children then resume your life. 

524 
01:19:23,555 --> 01:19:24,829 
Oh, Mom ... 

525 
01:19:27,235 --> 01:19:28,793 
Thank you. 

526 
01:19:29,675 --> 01:19:31,711 
And the hotel? And the meals? 

527 
01:19:31,955 --> 01:19:34,515 
- And the car? 
- We will get there. 

528 
01:19:34,755 --> 01:19:37,030 
Jenny, you are pregnant! 

529 
01:19:37,635 --> 01:19:41,184 
- Dr. Wickman is in agreement. 
- And our case? 

530 
01:19:41,835 --> 01:19:45,430 
Suzanne and Gary are there. 
You call every day. 

531 
01:19:46,075 --> 01:19:47,667 
No question. 

532 
01:19:50,515 --> 01:19:53,871 
- I find nothing here. 
- Thou shalt not find anything there. 

533 
01:19:54,075 --> 01:19:56,589 
- I go. 
- So, you go alone. 

534 
01:19:58,075 --> 01:19:59,030 
With me. 

535 
01:20:00,755 --> 01:20:03,064 
You are all crazy? 

536 
01:20:03,275 --> 01:20:05,186 
Listen, you are Jenny Cole, 

537 
01:20:05,475 --> 01:20:07,466 
Not Mary O'Neill. 

538 
01:20:07,755 --> 01:20:10,508 
Your son is Kevin, 
Sonny or not Frank. 

539 
01:20:10,795 --> 01:20:13,593 
It was at this family there 
I believe that. 

540 
01:20:13,875 --> 01:20:17,550 
It is my life to me. 
I think not reincarnation! 

541 
01:20:18,835 --> 01:20:20,666 
So, you think not me. 

542 
01:21:11,755 --> 01:21:13,347 
Welcome to Malahide. 

543 
01:21:13,995 --> 01:21:15,223 
There is. 

544 
01:21:16,315 --> 01:21:19,751 
- You know really where is the hotel? 
- It must be there. 

545 
01:21:24,315 --> 01:21:25,873 
It's bad side. 

546 
01:21:26,155 --> 01:21:27,474 
Pardon! 

547 
01:21:28,795 --> 01:21:29,545 
Go ahead. 

548 
01:21:50,595 --> 01:21:51,869 
It is still there. 

549 
01:21:52,275 --> 01:21:54,470 
- What? 
- The slaughter. 

550 
01:22:06,035 --> 01:22:06,990 
Wait! 

551 
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:12,993 
And the hotel? 

552 
01:22:30,275 --> 01:22:31,344 
It's crazy. 

553 
01:22:33,035 --> 01:22:33,990 
Look! 

554 
01:22:35,675 --> 01:22:38,030 
Lls came there every Sunday. 

555 
01:23:07,835 --> 01:23:10,144 
Hello. Can I help you? 

556 
01:23:10,395 --> 01:23:12,431 
Hello. I am Jenny Cole. 

557 
01:23:12,715 --> 01:23:15,752 
Here is my son Kevin. 
I have been on the phone. 

558 
01:23:15,955 --> 01:23:18,947 
Yes. Ravi you know. 
Hello, Kevin. 

559 
01:23:20,275 --> 01:23:23,472 
- You come to see the records? 
- If possible. 

560 
01:23:23,675 --> 01:23:25,984 
Come, I will drive there. 

561 
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:28,824 
The O'Neill is your family? 

562 
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,228 
Not exactly. 

563 
01:23:42,995 --> 01:23:44,110 
So? 

564 
01:23:45,995 --> 01:23:47,348 
- You find? 
- No. 

565 
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:49,625 
- Sorry. 
- Me too. 

566 
01:23:49,835 --> 01:23:52,554 
You have called 
Archives Dublin? 

567 
01:23:52,755 --> 01:23:54,552 
Yes. They have nothing. 

568 
01:23:56,435 --> 01:23:59,393 
Are you sure 
Swords Road where they lived? 

569 
01:24:00,675 --> 01:24:01,630 
Yes. 

570 
01:24:03,355 --> 01:24:06,791 
Malahide is a small town. 
Ask the people. 

571 
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:09,464 
It should be there at the corner. 

572 
01:24:10,275 --> 01:24:12,106 
That tells you something? 

573 
01:24:12,915 --> 01:24:14,553 
It Swords Road. 

574 
01:24:31,755 --> 01:24:35,031 
- Their house should be there. 
- Are you sure? 

575 
01:24:36,355 --> 01:24:37,868 
Somewhere there. 

576 
01:24:46,155 --> 01:24:49,830 
It's been a very long time. 
They seem to have everything demolished. 

577 
01:24:53,075 --> 01:24:54,224 
Excuse me. 

578 
01:24:54,435 --> 01:24:58,633 
I am Jenny Cole, I seek 
A family who lived here. 

579 
01:25:21,755 --> 01:25:24,952 
Excuse me, 
I am looking for the O'Neill family. 

580 
01:25:26,315 --> 01:25:28,749 
Excuse me. My mother and I ... 

581 
01:25:45,595 --> 01:25:47,233 
Nobody knows. 

582 
01:25:47,515 --> 01:25:50,188 
It has not yet 
Asked everyone. 

583 
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,908 
It seems as if. 

584 
01:26:17,275 --> 01:26:18,264 
Mom? 

585 
01:26:21,475 --> 01:26:22,510 
I return. 

586 
01:26:41,915 --> 01:26:44,475 
Hello. I am Jenny Cole. 

587 
01:26:45,555 --> 01:26:47,227 
The United States, right? 

588 
01:26:48,075 --> 01:26:49,633 
It is your accent. 

589 
01:26:49,835 --> 01:26:52,793 
I reside at Dunleavy Inn. 
You live here? 

590 
01:26:52,995 --> 01:26:53,950 
Yes. 

591 
01:26:55,155 --> 01:26:56,190 
Tell me ... 

592 
01:26:57,435 --> 01:26:59,585 
Ask your question still. 

593 
01:27:00,475 --> 01:27:02,784 
I am looking for the O'Neill family. 

594 
01:27:03,075 --> 01:27:04,474 
John and Mary. 

595 
01:27:05,395 --> 01:27:07,545 
They lived Swords Road circa 1930. 

596 
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:11,430 
They had 4 children: Sonny, 
Geoffrey, Frank and Elizabeth. 

597 
01:27:11,755 --> 01:27:13,552 
I can not help you. 

598 
01:27:14,555 --> 01:27:17,627 
I arrived at Malahide in 1952. 

599 
01:27:17,915 --> 01:27:20,270 
I just Killybegs, in the north. 

600 
01:27:21,915 --> 01:27:22,870 
Thank you. 

601 
01:27:32,435 --> 01:27:35,268 
- We are going where? 
- Back to Swords Road. 

602 
01:27:35,675 --> 01:27:37,233 
I will reapply. 

603 
01:27:51,755 --> 01:27:53,711 
Calm yourself, Phyllis. 

604 
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,150 
I took him. 

605 
01:27:58,475 --> 01:27:59,669 
I love you 

606 
01:28:00,435 --> 01:28:01,550 
So. 

607 
01:28:03,515 --> 01:28:06,313 
Know that ... Wherever you are ... 

608 
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:10,072 
I shall always on you. 

609 
01:28:17,795 --> 01:28:21,470 
What do you have? 
You are returned to full inside. 

610 
01:28:21,675 --> 01:28:23,233 
I had not seen. 

611 
01:28:24,115 --> 01:28:26,629 
Rest here, okay? I can straighten it. 

612 
01:28:28,795 --> 01:28:31,070 
Excuse us. 

613 
01:28:31,675 --> 01:28:34,235 
She has not seen slow. 

614 
01:28:43,115 --> 01:28:44,309 
Are you OK? 

615 
01:28:46,515 --> 01:28:48,073 
I look for them. 

616 
01:29:02,395 --> 01:29:03,874 
Papa, it's Kevin. 

617 
01:29:04,075 --> 01:29:06,509 
Hi, Kev. Everything is going well? 

618 
01:29:08,355 --> 01:29:10,391 
Not really. It was an accident. 

619 
01:29:10,675 --> 01:29:12,074 
Mom was driving. 

620 
01:29:12,275 --> 01:29:14,584 
It goes far? And you? 

621 
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:16,706 
Yes, we have nothing. 

622 
01:29:17,835 --> 01:29:19,985 
How it happened? 

623 
01:29:20,275 --> 01:29:23,233 
There was a stop sign, 
But she continued. 

624 
01:29:23,515 --> 01:29:26,712 
She was totally elsewhere. 
Like the other day in Brian. 

625 
01:29:26,915 --> 01:29:27,950 
It is there? 

626 
01:29:28,195 --> 01:29:32,074 
It is at the hotel, she sleeps. 
It happened just a few hours. 

627 
01:29:32,915 --> 01:29:33,984 
You find? 

628 
01:29:35,195 --> 01:29:36,423 
No, nothing. 

629 
01:29:36,635 --> 01:29:39,354 
- Nothing at all? 
- No. 

630 
01:29:42,195 --> 01:29:44,390 
Enter immediately at home. 

631 
01:29:44,995 --> 01:29:46,394 
No, Dad. 

632 
01:29:46,595 --> 01:29:49,234 
- Why? 
- I saw the church. 

633 
01:29:49,675 --> 01:29:51,506 
- Which church? 
- Here. 

634 
01:29:51,755 --> 01:29:55,191 
The Mary. 
The mother has drawn. 

635 
01:29:55,475 --> 01:29:57,352 
- Kevin ... 
- It has drawn 

636 
01:29:57,595 --> 01:29:59,790 
Because she had already seen. 

637 
01:30:03,555 --> 01:30:05,193 
We need you to come. 

638 
01:30:05,675 --> 01:30:07,233 
She needs you. 

639 
01:30:08,835 --> 01:30:10,393 
I know nothing ... 

640 
01:30:26,075 --> 01:30:28,987 
- I was asleep. 
- Yes. It's going better? 

641 
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:30,230 
Yes. 

642 
01:30:31,515 --> 01:30:33,471 
I am going to leave you to the steering wheel. 

643 
01:30:35,635 --> 01:30:37,626 
Your father was perhaps right. 

644 
01:30:40,675 --> 01:30:44,463 
- What can be done? 
- Back to Swords Road. 

645 
01:30:44,795 --> 01:30:46,467 
You are losing our time. 

646 
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:50,668 
- Call all O'Neill. 
- It has already done. 

647 
01:30:51,555 --> 01:30:54,274 
Return consult the records. 

648 
01:30:55,275 --> 01:30:59,473 
There was no trace of a Mary 
O'Neill who lived in Malahide. 

649 
01:31:02,275 --> 01:31:03,833 
It has tried everything. 

650 
01:31:06,075 --> 01:31:08,635 
I will walk. At just now. 

651 
01:31:10,195 --> 01:31:11,310 
Okay. 

652 
01:31:34,235 --> 01:31:35,714 
Ms. Cole! 

653 
01:31:36,515 --> 01:31:37,948 
It falls well. 

654 
01:31:39,235 --> 01:31:40,304 
Arthur McSweeney. 

655 
01:31:41,635 --> 01:31:43,705 
It was seen at the port this morning. 

656 
01:31:43,995 --> 01:31:46,111 
With the accident, I was worried. 

657 
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:48,314 
I am fine. 

658 
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:51,867 
I called a few friends. 
Here Thomas Layden. 

659 
01:31:52,075 --> 01:31:52,985 
Enchanté. 

660 
01:31:53,395 --> 01:31:57,627 
Thomas grew up a few houses 
The family you are looking for. 

661 
01:31:59,235 --> 01:32:01,191 
I knew Sonny. 

662 
01:32:09,275 --> 01:32:11,630 
Everything that was in the marshes. 

663 
01:32:11,915 --> 01:32:15,225 
And there was a river 
A little higher. 

664 
01:32:15,475 --> 01:32:18,467 
Today it is dried up 
Like me. 

665 
01:32:19,355 --> 01:32:23,348 
But first, 
It would seek water. 

666 
01:32:23,555 --> 01:32:26,069 
- You live where? 
- After the river. 

667 
01:32:26,275 --> 01:32:28,470 
- There were how many families? 
- Twenty. 

668 
01:32:28,675 --> 01:32:31,030 
It formed a small neighborhood. 

669 
01:32:32,155 --> 01:32:34,305 
Therein lies. 

670 
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:38,629 
Beware of branches. 
There is almost. 

671 
01:32:41,955 --> 01:32:43,547 
They lived here. 

672 
01:33:03,555 --> 01:33:07,548 
If she is pregnant again, 
She did not survive. 

673 
01:33:08,355 --> 01:33:10,471 
- I said no! 
- Do what I tell you! 

674 
01:33:10,675 --> 01:33:11,869 
Let her! 

675 
01:33:12,075 --> 01:33:14,270 
Sonny, no! 

676 
01:33:15,635 --> 01:33:17,307 
Wherever you are, 

677 
01:33:17,675 --> 01:33:20,473 
I shall always on you. 

678 
01:34:24,035 --> 01:34:25,753 
Remember your promise. 

679 
01:34:31,435 --> 01:34:33,630 
Remember your promise. 

680 
01:35:43,995 --> 01:35:47,431 
- They went where after his death? 
- I have ever known. 

681 
01:35:47,635 --> 01:35:49,865 
- They have lived here? 
- Yes. 

682 
01:35:50,075 --> 01:35:54,068 
There were Sutton, 
The Duffy, Brennan ... 

683 
01:35:54,275 --> 01:35:55,833 
The Sutton? 

684 
01:35:56,995 --> 01:35:58,474 
Her name Sutton? 

685 
01:36:00,075 --> 01:36:01,190 
Not O'Neill? 

686 
01:36:02,795 --> 01:36:05,628 
Sutton. John and Mary Sutton. 

687 
01:37:48,395 --> 01:37:50,704 
MARY SUTTON, 37 YEARS 
DÉCÉDÉE THE 24--10--1932 

688 
01:38:45,235 --> 01:38:46,554 
This is Mary. 

689 
01:38:49,115 --> 01:38:50,468 
You have found. 

690 
01:38:54,475 --> 01:38:56,033 
You have failed. 

691 
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:58,948 
You too. 

692 
01:39:01,675 --> 01:39:03,233 
Greatly. 

693 
01:39:05,635 --> 01:39:07,432 
Mr. Layden said that children 

694 
01:39:07,675 --> 01:39:09,791 
Were all baptized here. 

695 
01:39:09,995 --> 01:39:13,067 
If you have the right name, 
We will find them. 

696 
01:39:13,275 --> 01:39:15,425 
Come, there are others nearby. 

697 
01:39:21,235 --> 01:39:24,671 
Searching for a family 
That is not yours? 

698 
01:39:28,915 --> 01:39:31,952 
The Catholic Church does not believe 
To the reincarnation. 

699 
01:39:32,755 --> 01:39:36,714 
Not. But that does not mean 
She does not believe in miracles. 

700 
01:39:37,075 --> 01:39:38,633 
When things happen. 

701 
01:39:41,675 --> 01:39:43,427 
Here's what I think. 

702 
01:39:45,155 --> 01:39:47,225 
The soul does not die. 

703 
01:39:48,075 --> 01:39:50,873 
I do not think 
It can be reborn, 

704 
01:39:51,595 --> 01:39:54,746 
But it is possible, 
In rare circumstances, 

705 
01:39:55,355 --> 01:39:57,425 
She speaks 
Through another. 

706 
01:39:58,675 --> 01:40:02,873 
The soul of this woman asks you 
To regain her children. 

707 
01:40:03,995 --> 01:40:06,304 
I am not talking about reincarnation. 

708 
01:40:06,755 --> 01:40:08,746 
That is my interpretation. 

709 
01:40:10,075 --> 01:40:11,952 
That's it! 

710 
01:40:12,235 --> 01:40:14,795 
I baptismal certificates. 

711 
01:40:15,635 --> 01:40:18,024 
Yes, that's right. 

712 
01:40:18,515 --> 01:40:20,551 
Children of John and Mary Sutton. 

713 
01:40:20,835 --> 01:40:22,314 
They are five: 

714 
01:40:22,995 --> 01:40:24,474 
Phyllis, Elizabeth, 

715 
01:40:24,755 --> 01:40:27,144 
Frank, Geoffrey 

716 
01:40:27,995 --> 01:40:30,350 
- And John Junior. 
- It Sonny. 

717 
01:40:32,795 --> 01:40:34,751 
I know of no Sonny Sutton. 

718 
01:40:35,315 --> 01:40:37,465 
It is not in my parish. 

719 
01:40:38,915 --> 01:40:40,871 
And the others either. 

720 
01:40:57,795 --> 01:40:59,228 
It will not. 

721 
01:41:02,075 --> 01:41:06,227 
This is not necessarily Sonny 
Which put flowers on his grave. 

722 
01:41:06,475 --> 01:41:08,227 
Although, I am sure. 

723 
01:41:11,075 --> 01:41:12,428 
Inevitably. 

724 
01:41:16,875 --> 01:41:18,831 
I almost scared to see it. 

725 
01:41:20,395 --> 01:41:23,034 
I am afraid to come applecart his life. 

726 
01:41:24,795 --> 01:41:26,547 
Back to the hotel. 

727 
01:41:27,075 --> 01:41:29,031 
We will return tomorrow. Viens. 

728 
01:41:31,035 --> 01:41:32,229 
Go ahead, you. 

729 
01:41:34,435 --> 01:41:36,232 
I still have a few. 

730 
01:42:19,075 --> 01:42:20,030 
Mr. Sutton? 

731 
01:42:21,955 --> 01:42:23,229 
Mr Sutton! 

732 
01:42:23,515 --> 01:42:24,630 
Sonny? 

733 
01:42:28,755 --> 01:42:30,188 
I know you? 

734 
01:42:35,675 --> 01:42:37,631 
I know you. 

735 
01:42:38,115 --> 01:42:40,834 
I know your mother, your father. 

736 
01:42:41,755 --> 01:42:45,634 
- Your brothers and sisters. 
- You know my family? 

737 
01:42:47,155 --> 01:42:48,907 
You live Swords Road. 

738 
01:42:49,475 --> 01:42:52,990 
You cross the bay 
To work in the fields. 

739 
01:42:53,875 --> 01:42:56,833 
Your mother was waiting for you 
When you return. 

740 
01:42:58,915 --> 01:42:59,950 
Who are you? 

741 
01:43:02,275 --> 01:43:05,267 
Sorry, I will take wrong. 
I am Jenny Cole. 

742 
01:43:05,555 --> 01:43:07,944 
I come from Allentown, 
Pennsylvania. 

743 
01:43:09,915 --> 01:43:14,147 
I remember your family 
Through dreams that I do. 

744 
01:43:15,275 --> 01:43:18,108 
- Dreams? 
- I want to talk about it. 

745 
01:43:18,315 --> 01:43:21,193 
Please ... 
I just want to talk to you. 

746 
01:43:21,475 --> 01:43:23,830 
But I do not want to. 

747 
01:43:24,035 --> 01:43:26,549 
I know it seems strange, but ... 

748 
01:43:26,835 --> 01:43:31,351 
I wanted to make sure that you and 
Your brothers and sisters go well. 

749 
01:43:31,755 --> 01:43:33,871 
I do not know where they are. 

750 
01:43:34,075 --> 01:43:37,033 
I have not seen for 65 years. 

751 
01:43:37,275 --> 01:43:41,234 
- But I thought ... 
- I do not know. 

752 
01:43:41,435 --> 01:43:43,232 
I do not know you. 

753 
01:43:43,995 --> 01:43:48,227 
I will not talk about my family. 
Neither you nor anyone. 

754 
01:43:48,675 --> 01:43:50,870 
You tell me know. This is false. 

755 
01:43:51,075 --> 01:43:53,111 
Totally untrue. 

756 
01:44:00,675 --> 01:44:02,506 
You freed the rabbit. 

757 
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:20,627 
Your mother was pregnant. 

758 
01:44:20,915 --> 01:44:23,634 
In slaughter 
With Elizabeth and you, 

759 
01:44:24,435 --> 01:44:27,268 
She had a malaise 
And you have to 

760 
01:44:27,475 --> 01:44:29,227 
And took his hand. 

761 
01:44:30,955 --> 01:44:32,911 
One woman asked for water. 

762 
01:44:33,675 --> 01:44:37,224 
The butcher has pushed a drink 
Saying, Ms. O'Neill. 

763 
01:44:38,075 --> 01:44:40,270 
And your mother took the glass. 

764 
01:44:41,555 --> 01:44:43,910 
I thought she was called O'Neill. 

765 
01:44:46,275 --> 01:44:50,951 
How do you know his life 
As if you had lived? 

766 
01:44:52,275 --> 01:44:55,551 
The father believes Kelly 
It is the soul of Mary 

767 
01:44:56,155 --> 01:44:58,715 
Who speaks through me. 

768 
01:45:00,675 --> 01:45:04,634 
Now that I have the right name, 
We can find the others. 

769 
01:45:04,995 --> 01:45:08,032 
You can ask them 
Malahide to come to ... 

770 
01:45:11,075 --> 01:45:13,635 
I do not know what all this means, 

771 
01:45:14,075 --> 01:45:17,863 
But it's too late now. 
Too late. 

772 
01:45:18,075 --> 01:45:19,633 
Wait, Sonny! 

773 
01:45:20,035 --> 01:45:21,991 
I can not see them. 

774 
01:45:29,435 --> 01:45:33,030 
I had Frank on the phone. 
He will be there tomorrow morning. 

775 
01:45:33,275 --> 01:45:34,867 
We talked about you. 

776 
01:45:35,475 --> 01:45:37,670 
- There certainly not believed. 
- Correct. 

777 
01:45:37,875 --> 01:45:40,708 
But he wants to see his family. 
And Sonny? 

778 
01:45:41,595 --> 01:45:45,031 
II 1 hour drive each 
Week for the fall bloom. 

779 
01:45:45,875 --> 01:45:47,831 
But he does not want to come. 

780 
01:45:48,995 --> 01:45:50,348 
I do not know why. 

781 
01:45:52,395 --> 01:45:53,350 
There they are. 

782 
01:46:06,075 --> 01:46:07,030 
She is the one. 

783 
01:46:10,515 --> 01:46:12,471 
Let's welcome him. 

784 
01:46:23,515 --> 01:46:24,470 
Elizabeth Sutton? 

785 
01:46:24,755 --> 01:46:27,872 
- Yes. 
- Hello. I am the father Kelly. 

786 
01:46:28,075 --> 01:46:30,111 
Enchantée, my father. 

787 
01:46:30,395 --> 01:46:32,306 
I have spoken to Mrs. Cole. 

788 
01:46:33,555 --> 01:46:35,227 
Enchantée, Mrs Cole. 

789 
01:46:35,675 --> 01:46:37,825 
Call me Jenny. 

790 
01:46:39,435 --> 01:46:41,949 
You can call me Bessie. 

791 
01:46:45,755 --> 01:46:46,710 
Bessie. 

792 
01:47:05,595 --> 01:47:06,994 
Hi, Sonny. 

793 
01:47:10,635 --> 01:47:11,909 
I can speak? 

794 
01:47:17,515 --> 01:47:19,631 
You remember my father? 

795 
01:47:23,515 --> 01:47:25,346 
Very bad memories. 

796 
01:47:26,555 --> 01:47:28,034 
Even today, 

797 
01:47:28,275 --> 01:47:31,233 
I hold responsible 
The death of my mother. 

798 
01:47:33,595 --> 01:47:37,554 
I have long been afraid of him 
And souvenirs. 

799 
01:47:38,955 --> 01:47:40,911 
Today, I complain. 

800 
01:47:41,995 --> 01:47:44,634 
He had a wonderful family ... 

801 
01:47:45,355 --> 01:47:48,233 
He did not know the love and enjoy. 

802 
01:47:48,435 --> 01:47:51,108 
I heard my mother talk. 

803 
01:47:56,155 --> 01:47:58,350 
Sonny, I came to tell you 

804 
01:47:59,435 --> 01:48:02,393 
We found 
Your brothers and sisters. 

805 
01:48:06,835 --> 01:48:09,429 
But Geoffrey died 
10 years ago. 

806 
01:48:12,395 --> 01:48:15,034 
We have his death certificate. 

807 
01:48:19,355 --> 01:48:21,311 
The others are alive. 

808 
01:48:22,755 --> 01:48:26,225 
Phyllis lives in Wexford 
In recent years. 

809 
01:48:27,395 --> 01:48:29,351 
It happens tonight. 

810 
01:48:30,435 --> 01:48:33,586 
Elizabeth arrived 
Kilkenny this morning. 

811 
01:48:34,835 --> 01:48:37,224 
And Frank arrives tomorrow in England. 

812 
01:48:39,075 --> 01:48:41,031 
On a visit to church. 

813 
01:48:42,075 --> 01:48:45,272 
Not. No, Ms. Cole ... 

814 
01:48:54,715 --> 01:48:56,751 
Why do you do? 

815 
01:49:01,075 --> 01:49:03,270 
After the death of mother, 

816 
01:49:04,195 --> 01:49:06,425 
Dad sent us all 
In the fields. 

817 
01:49:06,915 --> 01:49:08,633 
As daily. 

818 
01:49:09,755 --> 01:49:11,711 
Small did not arrive, 

819 
01:49:11,915 --> 01:49:14,475 
Then he struck. 

820 
01:49:16,275 --> 01:49:19,585 
He was always drunk 
Or angry. 

821 
01:49:20,915 --> 01:49:24,464 
One night, 
When he was drunk death 

822 
01:49:25,075 --> 01:49:27,225 
I have taken to the orphanage. 

823 
01:49:28,075 --> 01:49:31,829 
The orphanage has accepted, 
But I think I was too big. 

824 
01:49:32,195 --> 01:49:33,230 
Sonny ... 

825 
01:49:35,555 --> 01:49:40,026 
I knew that the component, 
I do retrouverais ever. 

826 
01:49:41,675 --> 01:49:44,872 
But I embraced 
Without telling them. 

827 
01:49:46,075 --> 01:49:47,827 
I ran away. 

828 
01:49:49,915 --> 01:49:51,633 
I left there. 

829 
01:49:53,675 --> 01:49:55,950 
I returned 
A few years after. 

830 
01:49:56,675 --> 01:49:58,950 
I felt so guilty. 

831 
01:50:00,155 --> 01:50:02,305 
But Dublin was so great. 

832 
01:50:03,515 --> 01:50:05,665 
With so many people. 

833 
01:50:06,075 --> 01:50:09,829 
I had no money, 
I did not know where to look. 

834 
01:50:19,835 --> 01:50:21,791 
I have betrayed my promise. 

835 
01:50:25,995 --> 01:50:28,270 
I betrayed everyone. 

836 
01:50:31,995 --> 01:50:33,633 
She was desperate, 

837 
01:50:35,355 --> 01:50:37,630 
You have asked for the same. 

838 
01:50:38,835 --> 01:50:40,666 
You do not have a choice. 

839 
01:50:42,715 --> 01:50:44,671 
I promised him 

840 
01:50:44,995 --> 01:50:48,032 
That the children would remain together. 

841 
01:50:50,995 --> 01:50:53,509 
Keep that promise today. 

842 
01:50:57,155 --> 01:50:58,907 
Come to church. 

843 
01:51:06,795 --> 01:51:09,434 
Thank you for coming, Mrs. Cole. 

844 
01:51:38,795 --> 01:51:41,355 
Father Kelly is there. 
With Elizabeth. 

845 
01:51:42,075 --> 01:51:43,633 
And I see Phyllis. 

846 
01:51:43,835 --> 01:51:46,303 
- Tell them ... 
- What you get? 

847 
01:51:46,915 --> 01:51:48,871 
Everything will be fine. 

848 
01:51:54,675 --> 01:51:57,314 
Détends up, Mom. 
You pay me nervous. 

849 
01:51:58,675 --> 01:52:00,108 
Everything will be fine. 

850 
01:52:04,955 --> 01:52:05,785 
What? 

851 
01:52:07,435 --> 01:52:10,950 
Mary felt guilty if 
Abandoning her children 

852 
01:52:12,435 --> 01:52:14,187 
Not to be there for them. 

853 
01:52:15,475 --> 01:52:18,626 
So I wanted 
Keep you close to me. 

854 
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:24,949 
She has not seen her children grow up. 

855 
01:52:26,235 --> 01:52:27,714 
I am lucky. 

856 
01:52:32,315 --> 01:52:34,510 
You should go in California. 

857 
01:52:37,515 --> 01:52:40,825 
I thought rather 
Make my first year 

858 
01:52:41,635 --> 01:52:43,512 
Pennsylvania. 

859 
01:52:43,795 --> 01:52:46,263 
On weekends, 
I will be a big brother 

860 
01:52:46,555 --> 01:52:48,864 
And I can also help. 

861 
01:52:49,155 --> 01:52:51,066 
I would go elsewhere later. 

862 
01:52:52,195 --> 01:52:53,787 
Nothing t'y oblige. 

863 
01:52:57,155 --> 01:52:58,429 
I know. 

864 
01:53:01,675 --> 01:53:02,710 
Let's go. 

865 
01:53:22,995 --> 01:53:24,747 
My God, Frank? 

866 
01:53:26,675 --> 01:53:29,109 
Certainly. Let's go. 

867 
01:53:41,595 --> 01:53:43,153 
Phyllis. Elizabeth. 

868 
01:53:44,355 --> 01:53:48,428 
After all these years, I thought 
That there would be more. 

869 
01:53:51,275 --> 01:53:53,584 
What you have done is wonderful. 

870 
01:53:54,595 --> 01:53:56,347 
No matter how. 

871 
01:53:57,635 --> 01:53:59,387 
It's wonderful. 

872 
01:54:19,355 --> 01:54:22,108 
- I am so happy. 
- Me too. 

873 
01:55:50,875 --> 01:55:53,708 
The farm McConnel 
Is on the other side. 

874 
01:55:55,675 --> 01:55:58,633 
I was going to work 
When I was 9 years old. 

875 
01:55:59,675 --> 01:56:02,428 
I still see my mother 
Meanwhile here 

876 
01:56:03,275 --> 01:56:05,630 
Our return. 

877 
01:56:10,075 --> 01:56:11,588 
Thank you. 

878 
01:56:12,915 --> 01:56:15,224 
Thank you for bringing us together. 

879 
01:56:18,595 --> 01:56:20,551 
Since 2 days, I realized 

880 
01:56:21,155 --> 01:56:23,794 
That all memories 
Are not painful. 

881 
01:56:26,515 --> 01:56:29,552 
Sometimes 
Before I go to work, 

882 
01:56:29,835 --> 01:56:31,393 
My mother and I 

883 
01:56:31,955 --> 01:56:34,594 
Doing a tour of boat 
On the bay. 

884 
01:56:35,275 --> 01:56:38,233 
There were only two of us, 
On the water, 

885 
01:56:39,355 --> 01:56:41,027 
At sunrise. 

886 
01:56:42,275 --> 01:56:44,311 
It was so quiet ... 

887 
01:56:45,195 --> 01:56:46,867 
If beautiful ... 

888 
01:56:50,075 --> 01:56:52,066 
You should remembered. 

889 
01:56:56,675 --> 01:56:57,710 
Yes! 

890 
01:57:10,595 --> 01:57:12,233 
When I grow up ... 

891 
01:57:14,555 --> 01:57:16,352 
I will be how? 

892 
01:57:18,875 --> 01:57:22,754 
Some people believe 
It shows that from birth, 

893 
01:57:23,595 --> 01:57:26,951 
That man look 
To the child he was. 

894 
01:57:28,795 --> 01:57:32,310 
Thou shalt be as the boy 
That you are today. 

895 
01:57:33,275 --> 01:57:35,550 
Gentil. Attentionné. 

896 
01:57:36,635 --> 01:57:39,274 
Who loves people 
And that people love. 

897 
01:57:44,435 --> 01:57:46,073 
I am so proud of you. 

898 
01:57:48,075 --> 01:57:50,111 
I love you with all my heart. 

899 
01:57:52,075 --> 01:57:54,031 
And I always t'aimerai. 

900 
01:58:09,275 --> 01:58:12,472 
- So, you go where? 
- At Penn State or Bloomsburg. 

901 
01:58:12,755 --> 01:58:13,744 
Bloomsburg! 

902 
01:58:14,275 --> 01:58:17,108 
- Why? 
- It's closer. It was the job. 

903 
01:58:17,755 --> 01:58:19,074 
Doug! 

904 
01:58:25,275 --> 01:58:26,674 
My angel! 

905 
01:58:27,075 --> 01:58:28,303 
My Allison ... 

906 
01:58:31,555 --> 01:58:33,830 
Kevin takes care of you. 

907 
01:58:34,115 --> 01:58:35,468 
Oh, I go. 

908 
01:58:37,075 --> 01:58:38,713 
- Hi. 
- Hi. 

909 
01:58:38,995 --> 01:58:41,225 
Hi, Grandma. In later. 

910 
01:58:44,715 --> 01:58:46,353 
You have mail. 

911 
01:58:47,755 --> 01:58:49,427 
Take Allison. 

912 
01:59:03,915 --> 01:59:05,348 
Dear Jenny, 

913 
01:59:05,835 --> 01:59:08,952 
I received a photo of Allison 
This morning, 

914 
01:59:09,155 --> 01:59:12,943 
I wanted to congratulate you 
For this beautiful baby. 

915 
01:59:15,835 --> 01:59:18,872 
I see the next summer, 
When you come. 

916 
01:59:20,675 --> 01:59:22,267 
Franck, Bettie 

917 
01:59:22,555 --> 01:59:24,511 
Phyllis and come too. 

918 
01:59:25,875 --> 01:59:29,629 
And they come as a family, 
This time. 

919 
01:59:33,675 --> 01:59:36,553 
I am happy 
To be part of your life. 

920 
01:59:37,395 --> 01:59:40,034 
I have lost once, 
As a child. 

921 
01:59:40,395 --> 01:59:43,034 
I do not want to 
You lose again. 

922 
01:59:47,355 --> 01:59:49,630 
I also send you a photograph. 

923 
01:59:49,995 --> 01:59:51,951 
It was between the pages 

924 
01:59:52,235 --> 01:59:53,350 
Of a book. 

925 
01:59:57,955 --> 02:00:02,346 
This is a picture of my mother. 
I wish you have. 

926 
02:00:03,755 --> 02:00:05,029 
Write soon. 

927 
02:00:05,635 --> 02:00:06,909 
Sonny.
