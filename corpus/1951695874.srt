1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,700
oh God,

2
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,800
God grant me the serenity
to accept the things

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,800
I cannot change

4
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,400
why did you fight it so hard, Earl?

5
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,800
courage to change the
things that I can...

6
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,600
come one!

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,100

8
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,400
you know you wanna do this

9
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,400
and the wisdom...

10
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:07,000
...wisdom to know the difference

11
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,700
Taking, as He did, This sinful world

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,800
as it is, Not as I would have it

13
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,800
Trusting that He will make all things
right, If I surrender to His will,

14
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,900
that I may be reasonably
happy in this life

15
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,200
And supremely happy with
Him forever and next.

16
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:29,600
Amen

17
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,800
I could go on and on

18
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,400

19
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,500
how he give us so freely
his time and his money

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:41,700
even how he, uh, beliving
how he cuts his toenails

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,700
let's get him here and speak for himself

22
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,000
ladies and gentlemen

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,800

philanthropist, a very dear friend

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,600

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,600
Man of the Year

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,400
Mr. Earl Brooks

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,200

28
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,000

29
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,900
uhm...

30
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,700
first thing i'd like
to say is that I, uh...

31
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,000
i don't even know how i cut my toenails

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,500
20... years ago

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,700
when I started the brook's box factory

34
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,300
i never dream that i will...

35
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,800
I never dream that one
day i'll be standing here

36
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:45,800
subsbusters. blogspot.
com proudly presents

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,800
did you.. did you just
see Sis Wallace's dress?

38
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,600
you can see her nipples

39
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
at that age!

40
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,200
wow, she cannot keep those things hidden

41
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,400
the only thing that would have
made this evening more perfect...

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,000
if is Jane had been here

43
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,200
Emma, she called to
congratulate me, right?

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,900
she has mid terms coming up

45
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,800
I think she's dropping out

46
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,700
let's see

47
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:20,000
nothing she does is
wrong with you, is it?

48
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
well...

49
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,000
she missed a good party

50
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,800
it's not like it's not set up

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,800
you already know I don't
like pesty and lambs

52
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,800
you know i don't pick the lox

53
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,800
no

54
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,400
you are the fucking man of the year

55
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,100
you deserve a treat

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,800
no, Marshall, I said no

57
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,300
I heard you...

58
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,500
but you don't mean no

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,000
what's wrong?

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,200
nothing

61
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,400
you are flauting

62
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm thinking about what
I didn't say in the speech

63
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:09,800
oh...

64
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,600
honey

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
you were so... moving

66
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,000
you made us all laugh

67
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,500
i don't think anybody fold left down

68
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,800
they have their dance class tonight

69
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
you can just drive by...

70
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,700
...and look at them

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,000
there's not harming,
and just having a look

72
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,400
no, means no, Marshall

73
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
please...

74
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,600
put it, please

75
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,800
I though the food tonight was very good
but I was not crazy about the dessert

76
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,700
would you like to stop somewhere
and get something sweet?

77
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,900
Ok

78
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,500
norad is an adorable small dog

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,100
the labrador is supposed to be brave

80
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,400
Goltys, when he goes into
the trailer is very happy...

81
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,600
don't let me do this,
don't let me do this, please

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,500
I don't wanna start again

83
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,900

84
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,900
please... please

85
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,000
why did you figth it so hard, Earl?

86
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,100
I'm going to stay up a while

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,200
maybe going to the studio
or play with some glaciers

88
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,000
ok

89
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm gonna read... and If I'm not
awake, wake me when you come back

90
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,600
anyway?

91
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,100
I though you were
wonderful tonight Mrs Brooks

92
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,900
thank you Mr. Brooks

93
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
oh, I love the road my
boy! I' have missed this...

94
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,000
we are going to have so much fun

95
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:15,400
this is the last time Marshall,
Understand me? It's the very last time!

96
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
don't you dare, going
on your business, shut up

97
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,700
I wanna see what they are doing

98
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
hello

99
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,400
what the fuck!

100
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,000
be quiet!

101
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,200
set up!

102
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,800
uh, Earl

103
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,600
what the fuck is this?

104
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,700
these fucking pigs like to
do with the curtains open

105
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,400
You should have know now this
is a big mistake for you, Earl

106
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:20,800
almost like a wanted
get caught on, Marshall

107
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,900
I don't fucking do that

108
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:30,000
I don't think either what a joy is to spend the
rest of your life on death row or a lethal injection

109
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,100
Yes, Sir

110
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,000
please, forgive me

111
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,200
please, forgive me

112
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,500
you are fucked hard,
Earl. I don't give you that

113
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,800
don't even think about it

114
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,600
you know the rules

115
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,300
now upstairs, make love
with your beautiful wife

116
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,000
can we have the room, please?

117
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,600
thank you

118
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
there's just a thumbprint, right there

119
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,400
one his, one hers?

120
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,600
that was really nice

121
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,300
this guy has not been
acting for over 2 years

122
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,800
he always rearranges the bodies
but this is weird, I care of dare

123
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,400
usually he is much more romantic

124
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,800
arms around each other, kissing...

125
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,600
mouths open, tongues touching

126
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,200
bullets from straight of the victims

127
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,400
killer would covered this a lot

128
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,800
these were open or
closed when you got here?

129
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,700
closed

130
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
could it be the work of a copycat?

131
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,800
that's never been or viewed to the
public that the killer will treat his logs

132
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,600
Jesus, I was hoping
this guy was out or dead

133
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,600
or in jail or in some other charge

134
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,800
we checked all neighbourhood,
but so far nobody saw a thing

135
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,000
maybe he don't like this... he must to
be really angry at them for some reason

136
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,800
where do they keep their vacuum cleaner?

137
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,600
So I bet you 100 bucks, Hawkins,
there is not bag in this vacuum cleaner

138
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,500
I have not idea of what
the hell you are look for

139
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
he vacuums the house... and took the bag

140
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
what if he kills somebody that
did never get a vacuum cleaner?

141
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,400
he won't do that!

142
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,300
Our best hope is if someone
in there saw something

143
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,000
detective Tracy Atwood?

144
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,900
- Yes
- this is for you

145
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,600
you've been served

146
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
You, fucking asshole

147
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,100
- I am in the middle of a fucking murdering investigation
- Listen lady

148
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,000
- i'm just a messanger, here
- Hawkins,

149
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:45,800
what's the deal? I don't know it

150
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,900
get his ass out of here!

151
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,200
what it is?

152
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,300
assume to be, my ex husband
scumbag lawyer's trying to show me,

153
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:58,200
just how painful she can make my life
if i don't give them what they want

154
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,100
other any new members?

155
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,000

161
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,600

162
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:38,500
if you run and you step up there and say Hi,

163
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:42,800
I really got off on it but
I need your help, to be cured

164
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm different Marshall, i
won't argue that with you

165
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,400

there's time for requirements,
this is our first to tempt

173
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
"Mr. Brooks, your daughter is
waiting for you in your office"

174
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Well I hope this is what
you have in mind, if not...

175
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,800
we would love to work with
you, further on the design

176
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,600

00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,000
Uh, Matt Johnson, wants to schedule,
lauch for friday, contact him...

182
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,600

- Can you hold this for a second?

183
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,900
did Jane call to say she was coming?

184
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,800
Uh, nobody gave me
that message Mr. Brooks

185
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
- she is...
- yeah, she is, and...

186
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,400
she has some boxes and suitcases downstairs
and she didn't have any money for the cab

187
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,200
and you paid for that

188
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,300

189
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:20,800

193
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,900
when it's appropriate

194
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,600

195
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,800
Ehy, can I've some water?

196
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,500

197
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,200
what are you doing here?

198
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,400
I'm sorry daddy

199
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,100
please, don't be angry with me

200
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I can guess what you've done

201
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
but why don't you tell
me then I'll decide

202
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,600
I've dropped out the school

203
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,300
oh Jane

204
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,000
ok

205
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,200
uh... have you told your mother?

206
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,800
no, I wanted to talk to you first

207
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,000
Well, you gonna have to
tell her, Jane All right?

208
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm not gonna do that for you

209
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,100
why can't you...

210
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,000
sit!

211
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
and then,

212
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,600
together, the three of us, we decide

213
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,300
where it goes from here

214
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,100
Well, I tought a lot all about this?
college is a waste of time for me

215
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,900
All this...

216
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,300
All this... how somebody know that,
half way through their freshmen year?

217
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,400
you did even go to college
daddy and you are successful

218
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
I wanna come work for you

219
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,800
she is not telling you
everything, she is hiding something

220
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,400
hell no!

221
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,400
I am not hiring right now, sweetheart

222
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,600
ok, but just listen to me for one second

223
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,200
all right?

224
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,900
look! what happen to the business if, God
forbid, something wouldn't happen to you?

225
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,800
ok

226
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,600
mom would probably have
to sell the strangers

227
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,500
look, I willing to start from the bottom

228
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,600
you can treat me like a regular employee

229
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,800
I just wanna learn everything there is
to know about welling the box business

230
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:05,000
then, when the time comes...

231
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,800
i can stay in the family

232
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,000
all that's sweet, honey, but

233
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,900
you are not talking about business, you
are talking about emotions, now get up...

234
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,800
infact, Your mother and I, came...
this close to selling out last year

235
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,200
what?

236
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,200
that's right, and hadn't will
been offered a little more money

237
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,900
and still, may come back to us...

238
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,000
we would sell

239
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,600
what would you do without business?

240
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,600
yes?

241
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,400
I'm sorry. The man outside insisted
that I'll give this to you, he claims

242
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,200
that you'll find what's
inside, very interesting

243
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,900
what is he, Sunday? is he a salesman?

244
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,700
No, I've never seen him before

245
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,200
I'll just give him back
and I'll tell him to call

246
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,800
No, Sunday, Sunday, here...

247
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,100
Thank you

248
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,300

249
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,500
to give yourself a chance to...

250
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,600
uh, find out...

251
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,600
who you are

252
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
and what you wanna do

253
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
I'll talk to mom

254
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,600

257
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,300
but new rules, I wanna
be treated as adult

258
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,800
would you pay for rent?

259
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,400
would you pay for food?

260
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,800
no dad, you are a very welfy man
I think you can effort to keep me

261
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,200
Sunday, would you escort the
gentleman who gave you the envelop...

262
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,300
into the conference room and
tell him i would meet him there?

263
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
no problem, Mr Brooks

264
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,400
and, uh...

265
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,600
what happen to the BMW, Jane?

266
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,000
a friend is gonna drive it up
but he will be here week-end

267
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,800
and get Jane a cab

268
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,400

269
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,800
are you gonna gimme a job?

270
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,600
if you were up to me and I think your
mother will agree with this, I, uh...

271
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,800
I think you should go back to school

272
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,100
you see that Marshall?

273
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,900
that's why I didn't wanna
do that damned couple

274
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
stop with fucking widing your own

275
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,200
you enjoyed doing that couple just as
as much I did and look at the right side

276
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,000
he cames to us, he didn't go to the cops

277
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,800
if he's trying to shake us
down, we kill him, period.

278
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,300
we make it fun but we'll kill him

279
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,300
end of the story

280
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,400
what can I do for you, Mister...

281
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,400
Let's say... Smith

282
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,800
Ok Mr. Smith

283
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,200
before you get the wrong impression, Mr
Brooks, I'm not here to shake you down

284
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,600
I hope this is the only copies of
these photos and you have no others

285
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,700
no

286
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,800
I have other copies and other photos

287
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,900
and if anything happens to me...

288
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
how did you find me Mr. Smith?

289
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,000
you are the man of the year, Mr. Brooks

290
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:27,000
your picture is in the paper

291
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:32,800
and if it had not been... I don't know,
I don't know what I would have done

292
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,000
lucky me

293
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,700
what is it that I can help you with?

294
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,400
I've been watching
that couple for months

295
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
yeah, they liked to make
love with the blinds opened

296
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,600
sometimes I would... take pictures

297
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,600
visual aids, for later

298
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,600
is a great way to get
off, I tell you that

299
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,400
was fun, I though

300
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,000
until I saw you killed them

301
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:01,600
and I have never

302
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,000
ever felt out that... rush!

303
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,200
like that, ever

304
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,500
I know you are the thumbprint killer

305
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,200
you have done this before

306
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,400
what I want?

307
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,600
it's for you, to take me with
you next time you kills someone

308
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,900
and I'd like that to be soon

309
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,900
and you were worried this
was going to be unpleasant?

310
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,400
the answer is simple

311
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Just tell Mr. Smith that you
have decided never to kill again

312
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,200
and you're going away

313
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,600
you enjoy watching me suffer, don't you?

314
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,400
in a word, yes

315
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:54,100
where do you think he
has the other pictures?

316
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,400
he put it in a safety deposit box

317
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,600
but I bet the box is in the banks
where he keeps his checking account

318
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,300
and the key...

319
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,200
it's on his key chain

320
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,100
he really wants us to do this

321
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
he is not going to the cops

322
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,900
we have a deal?

323
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,000
for the angle of these pictures...

324
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:34,600
you live at the 3rd floor at apartment building
across the alley, front of the couple house

325
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,100
uh

326
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,000
yes or no, Mr. Smith?

327
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:40,900
yes

328
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,800
what time did you get home from work?

329
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:44,700
6.30

330
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,200
7, depending of the traffic

331
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,600
you can't never come here again

332
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
you can't never call me
do you understand that?

333
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,600
yes

334
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
tomorrow night

335
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,000
not tonight, tomorrow night at 8 o'clock

336
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,400
leave your apartment
building and walk east

337
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,300
I will pick you up there

338
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,400
if you are thinking
about doing anything...

339
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,600
for both to aware the rules, Mr. Smith

340
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,600
but I feel I must warn you

341
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,000
if it turns out that you enjoy killing

342
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,000
you can become very addicted

343
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
it can ruins your life

344
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,700
I wanna do this

345
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,500
have I covered everything?

346
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,800
I can't think of anything else

347
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,300
then I'll see you
tomorrow night Mr. Smith

348
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:03,700
we've talked to our client and in common we put here
what we figure out, we feel this is more than fair

349
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
we can have a check for that
amount in your office by 6pm o'clock

350
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,400
oh, we told you at the
beginning what we wanted

351
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,800
and it hasn't changed

352
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,100
we feel our offer is more than generous

353
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,800
I paid for everything,
when we were together

354
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,800
and now I'm been asked
to give this guy a bonus?

355
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,600
for spending time with me, time that
I've already paid for in the first place?

356
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,400
you know as well as I do, counselor,
you're not gonna get a million five

357
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,900
oh, I - don't -
know that, no, I...

358
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,200
well, infact, this is the
front page of yesterday's paper

359
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
"Hangman escapes"

360
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,600
after torturing his victims

361
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,600
Thorton Meeks

362
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,100
well, hide him in public places,

363
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:50,400
church steeple, balconies,
freeways over passes...

364
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,400
where this is going?

365
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,000
Well, your client captures Mr. Meeks

366
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,800
Come on Tracy, this is
not a lot of money for you

367
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:03,300
and we both know how afraid that I was after Meeks
says that he was gonna escape and come back to kill you

368
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,600
let me ask again

369
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,500
what is your point?

370
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:10,400
Our point is that Meeks,
or someone like Meeks

371
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,900
make hurt after my client
in order to hurt your client

372
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,700
that is very imaginative, counsellor

373
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,700
but it's not based in reality at all

374
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,600
Jesse

375
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,500
let's just handle this, please

376
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,600
- Tracy
- Jesse

377
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,000
you know what will make me
feel really safe right now?

378
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,400
if you got hit by a truck...

379
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
and die

380
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,000
well, that's it?

381
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,900
Mr. Vialo and I, are leaving

382
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,800
you are threatening the safety of my client,
we are going after to get a straight order

383
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,400
we see in court

384
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,600
you hit by a truck and die?

385
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,400
fuck it, I felt good

386
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,600
what was here it's not
here, that's interesting

387
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,700
I hate the number, I'll say that
this people been killed by a ghost

388
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,600
the autopsy said there was a little tiny
piece of plastic in the female victim's brain

389
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,100
it's a dead end, the bag with the gun, he puts one
gallon plastic foresinc bag over his hand to his wrist

390
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,700
little bit of plastic comes out, when the
first one is gonna shots, it goes in the bag

391
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,900
are you looking for me?

392
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I've received the subpena from
your husband for your works records

393
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,400
where you worked, date and
time, for the past two years

394
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:26,200
he just tries to blackmail me, do you remember?
my lawyers assure me that I'll never go to court

395
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,800
I can't take that chance

396
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,600
almost three courts of
your cases is a current

397
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,400
so, until you'll set your divorce
i'm gonna have to put you on the desk

398
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,500
that's also blackmail

399
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,600
do you have any idea what
this guy has done to me?

400
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,600
while we're married, while
i was paying for everything

401
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,500
he was just out and fuck every
woman he can gets his hands on

402
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,200
he fucked my friends,
he fucked my cousin

403
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,400
he made me look as an idiot

404
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,800
- and?
- and what?

405
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,600
get over it!

406
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:57,800
you can't roll there's a woman wanna
have this one blousy man in your life

407
00:29:57,900 --> 00:30:01,000
well, I made him an offer and I
won't goin to give him a dime more

408
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,600
did you hear that Meeks escaped?

409
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,600
yeah

410
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,900
you get gonna looking for him,
you want me yo put a detail on you?

411
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,000
I think I can take care of myself

412
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:14,000
it's one of your biggest problem,
Tracy you don't know how to ask for help

413
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,200
what the fuck, what the fuck, what...

414
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,400
don't worry, if I were here to
kill you, you were already be dead

415
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,500
after you left today, I realize that our
friendship was a little one side of it

416
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,800
so, tomorrow night when we meet,
would you be so kind us to bring

417
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,000
all the pictures and the
memory card from your camera

418
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,400
that way we can like each
other simply for who we are

419
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,600
if you don't show up

420
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,100
I will presume that you have gone
to the police and I will kill you

421
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,600
even if I'll go to jail because of you Mr
Smith, someone will find you, wherever you are...

422
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,600
and they will kill you

423
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,200
Mr. Brooks

424
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,800
Mr. Brooks

425
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,300
Mr. Brooks

426
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,000
WoW

427
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,200
it's nice to have you home

428
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,800
hello, hello. You have to explain this
to me 'cause i'm your mother, that's why!

429
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,700
what's wrong, girls?

430
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
I asked your daughter what's the
real reason she dropped out the school

431
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,600
I told you, it's not the real reason

432
00:33:59,100 --> 00:33:59,900
honey...

433
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,300
you wanted to go to college

434
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,000
you have good grades, your father put
in favours to get you in that school

435
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,200
if this is not the reason...

436
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,900
please, Dear God, tell me the reason

437
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,700
what is your mother thinking
even dropped you out the school?

438
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm pregnant

439
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,300
but that's not the reason I dropped out

440
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,800
being pregnant wouldn't keep me
for going to school if I wanted to

441
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:25,800
who is the father?

442
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,600
some guy a was seeing

443
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,000
some, some guy, does he knows?

444
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,300
what he knows Dad?

445
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,200
he is married, he got two kids,
I want nothing to do with me

446
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,000
oh, honey

447
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
oh, honey

448
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,500
I'm not gonna go throw with it

449
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
there is nothing to be upset about

450
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,300
I mean, I was even
not gonna tell you guys

451
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:43,800
then would be

452
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,800
no abortion, jane

453
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,900
no Dad, you're not gonna
tell me what to do, ok?

454
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,800
it's my body and I'll
do what I want with it

455
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,600
I'm sorry, you're right. i said it wrong

456
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,000
I wasn't trying to tell
you what to do when I was...

457
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,000
what I was trying to say is that...

458
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,500
a grandchild would be a wonderful gift

459
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,100
for your mother and me

460
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,600
would you really wanna have a
grandchild? even if I'm not married?

461
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,200
yes

462
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,700
a child is what's important

463
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,400
we would... we would love him and
cheer him completely and we would...

464
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,400
we would help you raise him

465
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,600
if it means that much to
you, I will think about it

466
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,600
I'm gonna have to start getting
up little earlier, uh, honey?

467
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,400
well, we were right

468
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,800
she was hiding something

469
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,000
pregnancy is not of all of it,
she's hiding something bigger

470
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,200
something much bigger

471
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:10,600
you think so?

472
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,200
I know so

473
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,200
and so do you

474
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,800
it's darker tonight
than it was on your night

475
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,200
but still...

476
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,800
how did you managed to not
bumping into the furniture?

477
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,300
was the light on?

478
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,000
or did you turn it on?

479
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,000
because I know you and you
won't risk a shot in the dark

480
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,400
where have you been?

481
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,600
did you miss the thrill of killing?

482
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,600
what if these are stayed closed

483
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,400
because you yanked them closed

484
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,800
which would mean...

485
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,300
they were open...

486
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,400
...when you came into the room

487
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,400
thank you, I appreciate your time

488
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,100
ops, sorry, i'm sorry

489
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,200
no, I'm sorry

490
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,100
I was just about to knock

491
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I'm detective Atwood, portland police

492
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,400
hey, do you wanna see me?

493
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,500
fine

494
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,200
you are a photographer
Mr... Bafford?

495
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,600
- No
- No?

496
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
thank you

497
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:49,700
no,

498
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:52,800
uh, actually it's...
a hobby i just started

499
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,200
well, do you know, there was a murder?

500
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,100
yes, in the house, close the way

501
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,200
You didn't happen to see something
unusual or suspicious that night, did you?

502
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,100
no, I wondered that
when it happened, but

503
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,200
no

504
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm sorry, i'm supposed
to be meeting somebody

505
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,600
and I don't want to be late

506
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,000
uh, well, here is my card

507
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,800
if you did hear something
or remember anything

508
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,700
uh, i wish I could be
more helped, but,uh,sorry!

509
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,600
he looks clean

510
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,800
looks like he's alone

511
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:47,000
no,i tell you, he
really wants to do that

512
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,800
maybe I should plow
with him... pick him up

513
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
no, just honk

514
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:58,600
maybe he get killed crossing the street
and save us the mess he's doing up

515
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
almost

516
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,200
it's coming down hard

517
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,100
they said would be sunny tomorrow

518
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:35,900
I never trust those guys

519
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,600
they say it's gonna be clear, then rains

520
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,600
and they say it's gonna
rains and it's... sunny

521
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,300
I believe this is what you asked for

522
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,600
the pictures in the memory card...

523
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,400
all here

524
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,500
both

525
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,600
you and I both know that not
all the pictures are in here

526
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,200
and you made a copy of the
memory card, as an asshole

527
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
but, you understand my position?

528
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,200
yes, I do

529
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:14,400
but it's my hope you want to get to know me
better you feel confortable in giving me everything

530
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,200
that I've asked you for

531
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,400
sounds fair

532
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,100
maybe you'll be interested in this

533
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,300
this is the police woman,
who is looking for you

534
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:31,800
wow, we never know anyone
was looking for us before

535
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,600
you have to find everything
there is to know about this...

536
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,800
woman

537
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,600
this is close, Marshall

538
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,400
this is to damn close

539
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,400
so...

540
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,000
what's the plan?

541
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,200
where do we, uh, what
are we doing here tonight?

542
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,200
we'll drive around until we
see someone we think we might

543
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:58,800
enjoy killing

544
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,600
really?

545
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,100
you don't have have somebody... in mind?

546
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,800
I don't enjoy this Mr. Smith, I do it

547
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,700
because I am addicted to it

548
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,000
before you're in in my life I
had that I would never kill again

549
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,200
so, this is... your part

550
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,800
you can choose anyone you
want and we will do it together

551
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,400
can i pick somebody that I know?

552
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,800
no

553
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:40,000
you'll never kill someone you know

554
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,300
it's the easiest way to get caught

555
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,200
- ok?
- yeah

556
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,600
locked up?

557
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,100
you look a little bit like that...

558
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,700
E.T. guy

559
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,000
remember that movie? when
he flies on that bike?

560
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
- yeah, yeah
- yeah

561
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:01,300
I like that movie

562
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,200
Jesus Christ

563
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,800
fuck him

564
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
this is fault, he is an asshole

565
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:11,800
fuck you

566
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,600
maybe Mr Smith would like to kill

567
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:18,200
the driver of the pick up

568
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,100
what about the driver of the pick up?

569
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,000
what if we kill him?

570
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,000
yes

571
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,800
yes, I always wanted to fucking kill
somebody fucking to be in traffic

572
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:40,000
well, if you want to
kill the driver of pick up

573
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,800
I'll give you the honor

574
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,400
ehy, maybe not be the same

575
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,300
driver

576
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,800
ok

577
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,000
well, driver I am, to will give
a good looking at him or her

578
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,400
any problem to kill a woman?

579
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,100
no, no. an asshole is an asshole

580
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:11,600
I wasn't in town that night

581
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,300
my roommate was, maybe he saw something

582
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,200
Uh, may I speak to him?

583
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:17,700
he is in on his way to Tokyo right
now, he is also a flight attendant

584
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:21,000
did the victims ever leave
their bedroom curtains open?

585
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,000
all the time

586
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,800
I don't know if we can see them doing it and
that's why you are asking but they didn't care

587
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,100
well, here is my card

588
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,100
if you can have your roommate call me

589
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,100
and people of this number know how to
reach me at everytime, day and night

590
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:36,000
I won't be here, but
I will leave him a note

591
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,000
ok great, thank you

592
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:37,800
sure

593
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,800
would recognize him if you saw
his driving licence picture?

594
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,000
yeah

595
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,600
I'll memorize the licence
number, you write it down

596
00:46:41,700 --> 00:46:42,500
I got it

597
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:45,500
wow

598
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:49,600
well, when you get
home, go on the Internet

599
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,600
find everything you
can... about this guy

600
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,900
we are gonna kill him tonight?

601
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:55,800
no

602
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,800
we could, but then we
won't be under control

603
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,000
we can leave lose ends but we
both know the danger of that

604
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,000
ok, I will do

605
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:15,000
what are... we... doing?

606
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,200
what are you doing?

607
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,000
look at me!

608
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,000
- look at me!
- why?

609
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,600
- close your eyes
- why?

610
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:28,600
close

611
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,500
what's the licence plate number?

612
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:37,800
shit

613
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,100
P4...

614
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,200
no

615
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,400
2, uh

616
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,300
I know I tore, then

617
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
because of the tree?

618
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,900
don't feel bad

619
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,800
I've been doing this a
long time. pen and paper

620
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,000
look out the window and write it down

621
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,300
how is your first time like?

622
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:01,000
you really don't wanna know
that much about me, Mr. Smith

623
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,400
no, I don't think it was right, go back

624
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,600
ok, we are in

625
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:27,300
for all the taxes we pay you think
they'll make it more difficult

626
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:29,400
to hack into the police personnel file

627
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,200
the father is John Atwood, why...

628
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:36,200
why does that ring a bell?

629
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,500
somebody you got business with?

630
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,400
someone we...

631
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,800
killed

632
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,400
no, no somebody we killed

633
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:45,800
let me see here, MBA

634
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,200
and married, she has
been a cop for 12 years

635
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:51,400
married Dr. Carlson

636
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:55,300
divorced Dr. Carlson
married at Jesse Vialo

637
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:58,600
and so two are separated,
from Jesse Vialo sue

638
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,200
...for support by Jesse Vialo seems

639
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,800
uhm, seem a shrimp

640
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,600
because of Jesse Vialo

641
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,400
who, who, who

642
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,500
she has caught a lot of people

643
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:15,400
and look here, this is not her first
time she has been looking for us

644
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,000
ok, here we are

645
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:24,600
Jesse Vialo, good looking,
a little younger than she is

646
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,700
younger, rest of all to her

647
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:31,000
she married him in a
rebound from the doctor

648
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,400
and the boy has married her
for money and connections

649
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:38,100
just because the old men
that doesn't mean she is rich

650
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,400
maybe is one of the kind of guys
ready to give her to the oprah

651
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:43,600
and than to his kids

652
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,700
what does she have to declare?
any outside and coming holdings?

653
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,700
oh, you are a...

654
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,400
you are a genius

655
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
the oprah didn't get much

656
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,100
why would a woman, worth
60 plus million dollars...

657
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,200
and probably more to come...

658
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,600
wanna be a cop?

659
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:22,200
I like that about her

660
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:28,100
you are a such a fucking snob, Earl
you like her because she is rich

661
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,500
no, i like her because she
founds something that's hers,

662
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:33,000
is not the family business,
and she is good at it

663
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,900
I'd like Jane to find
something it's... hers

664
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,100
and than she can be good at it

665
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:46,400
That's exactly why I would
scare the shit out of me

666
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,400
she's a cop who doesn't
need the money...

667
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:51,600
and she is looking for us.

668
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:53,700
that's one fucking dangerous human being

669
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,000
the fact you are not wrong
just not making me me admire her

670
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,500
any less

671
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,000
hey Nancy!

672
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:02,800
hi Tracy,

673
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,500
thank you for meeting me here

674
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,300
I got your latte

675
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,800
you wanna be walk and talk
while I hear your big idea?

676
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:08,800
oh, sure

677
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,100
you really wanna settle this?

678
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:10,900
If I can

679
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,200
I'd like to use your father

680
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,600
no

681
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,500
my father does nothing for nothing

682
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:21,300
Tracy, I understand but your
father has a lot of political massed

683
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:22,800
his poll won't make everything go away

684
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,200
but it would be a tremendous help

685
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,200
absolutely not

686
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,500
you're right

687
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,000
we could have done this one on the phone

688
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,600
if you will wanna play the game
right on the desk for a year

689
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,700
- i'm sure we can settle it
at 1,25- 1,5... - uff, I...

690
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,000
I'm not sit on a desk

691
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,800
an the only other option is your father

692
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:36,800
or money

693
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,300
1,5 and that's it

694
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:42,700
ok

695
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:44,200
I'll call them today

696
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,100
I just need to get this
done as soon as possible

697
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:51,000
that's what Jesse is counting on

698
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,800
I'll call you when I have something

699
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,600
oh, Tracy

700
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:02,400
your husband said there's a picture of him
holding some trophy, that you still have?

701
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,300
what picture? he has everything

702
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,600
he claims it's his favourite picture

703
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,700
and you put it up when
you store your suitcases

704
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,400
I'll look

705
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:12,900
I Know?

706
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,100
petty, you are going to divorce

707
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,200
thanks for the latte

708
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:44,400
I told you I was coming back to get you

709
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:47,400
how do you find the place
where i'm gonna hang you?

710
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,100
first

711
00:52:51,800 --> 00:52:53,200
