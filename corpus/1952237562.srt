57
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:58,824
to lease at no cost
some road frontage
to the endeavor,

58
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:02,129

drive heavy tourist traffic
right to our door.

or whatever other schemes

64

you out last summer.

65

We've decided to
go classical with the
festival this year,

66
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,554
maybe a string quartet,
more contemporary,
like Morton Feldman?

67
00:05:22,622 --> 00:05:25,386
Very avant-garde.
And we've got a theater
troupe in the barn.

68
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:27,517
You have a theater
troupe in the barn?

69

The Earthlight Players.
Vassar graduates,
some of them.

70
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,861
They live in the barn?

71
00:05:36,536 --> 00:05:38,026
They do everything
in the barn.

seen the sign?
What sign?

73
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,964
The sign in
front of the barn.

74
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:45,636
Mr. Spiers, my God, please.
We come here, begging,

75
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,339
begging for mercy,
and what do you give us?

76
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,813
This fixation about the barn.
What is it with you
and the barn?

77
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:52,942
I was just...
I'm an old woman,
Mr. Spiers. I've suffered.

78
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,921
I walked here all the way
from Minsk, in Russia,

79
00:05:56,989 --> 00:06:01,050
in 20-foot snow drifts,
1,000 miles across Siberia.

80
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:04,460
I escaped the pogroms,
the Tsar's secret police,

81
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,522
with nothing but cold
potatoes in my pockets.

82

Mrs. Teichberg, please...
And for what?

83
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,197
For more persecution!
It's because we're Jewish.

84
00:06:13,272 --> 00:06:15,797
I know it, isn't it?
Mrs. Teichberg, please.

85
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,365

colonies are Jewish,
they're all our clients.

on goes the gas!

for that nightclub

112

The special way

Be free, stop throwing
your life away up there.

on them now.
Why not?

I'm the one they
still want around.

127
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:51,360
I guess that means they
love me more than you.

128
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:55,829
That must be a great
consolation to you.

129

Come on, everyone.

Last meeting, we all said
we'd each bring some
new ideas to the table.

141
00:10:05,838 --> 00:10:07,430
Well, okay.

142
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,140
We got a lot of dairy farms
around here, right?

143
00:10:12,812 --> 00:10:16,304
And a fair number of bulls.

144
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:17,644
Okay, you've all
heard of the running

145
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,083

that town in Spain,

Pampoona.
Pamplona.

147
00:10:22,521 --> 00:10:24,751
Well, no one's doing
one in the Catskills.

148
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,120
Seems to be a big
draw over there.

149
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,227
It would be very amusing
to see all those Jews

150
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,197
from Levitsky's
summer colony,

151
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:36,962
you know, the ones
with the black top hats
and the curls,

152
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,472
running for their lives
chased by our
local livestock.

153
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,831

you can't bring that up
in every meeting.

158
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,621
I've written
to the Governor,

159
00:10:58,691 --> 00:11:01,125
but I think a letter
from the entire
Chamber of Commerce

160
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,218
would be much
more effective.

161
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,321
A monorail linking
downtown New York
to White Lake

162
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,129
would be a tremendous spur
to the local economy.

334
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:27,902
Thank you, Elliot.

335
00:22:27,979 --> 00:22:31,779
For the backdrops you
painted for all of us.
Everybody loves the colors.

336
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,944
It's like a mandala.
Actually, it's not
like a mandala.

337
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,786
Well, the colors,
it's more like M&M'S.

338
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:40,788
You're welcome, Dev.

339

want some? Cholent?

341
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,262
Maybe next time.

342
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,694
No, I'm cool.

343
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,839
Hey, man,
what's up with this?

344
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,843
The festival.
The locals killed it.

345
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,139
They pulled the permit.

346
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,541
In Wallkill?

347
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,615
The Wallkillians
killed it.
DEVON: Bummer, man.

348
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:11,183
We were all hoping
to score some tickets
and go over for it.

349
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:16,891
Could have been beautiful.
Joan Baez, Grateful Dead,
The Who.

350
00:23:16,962 --> 00:23:19,726
Maybe even Dylan.
DEVON: Yeah, Dylan.

351
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:21,020
Dylan.

352
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:25,500
Can I get that
paper for a sec?

353
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,834

all right, Elliot?

He's the President of

wanna drown thousands
of kids in a swamp?

you guys can do whatever
you want to here.

That's fine
with us, really.

400
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:52,359
You could... For example,
you could detonate

401
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:53,927
an incredible amount
of explosives

402
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,269
and it would dry
everything out immediately.

403
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,775
And then you
could just compact
the ashes down, you know,

404
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,107
and people could
sit on that.

405
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:07,645
Radical thinking, Elliot.
I assume you got
a permit for that, too?

406
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:12,579
Or... Okay,
we get some big cranes

407
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:16,525
and hang, like,
a parachute over the field,
and everyone could sit on it.

408
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:17,583
No?

409
00:28:18,596 --> 00:28:20,564

We may not have
vacancy for everyone,
as the season is...

Here. Try some of this.

00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:57,727
It is the best
chocolate milk in New York.
Made just down the road.

419
00:29:01,639 --> 00:29:03,470
Have some water.
Or some chocolate milk.

420
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,672
What's his name?
Or her.
Lou.

421
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:14,311
Wow. That is excellent
chocolate milk.

422
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:17,081
Yeah, it comes
from the local cows.
Far out.

423
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:21,389
They eat local grass.
That must be
some healthy grass.

424
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:25,091
And there's a lot of it,
in big fields,

425
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,154
just a couple of miles
down the road from us.

426
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,633
I've always been
a big supporter of Elliot,
here in Bethel,

427
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:41,474
and I always enjoy
his music festival
every summer.

428
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:46,176
That's why we're here.
Miriam and I donate
the yogurt and the milk.

429
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:49,647
It's fate.

430
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,081
It's beautiful.

431
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:56,951
Although some of
the local young people,
the music they play

432
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,930
can be a little trying,
if you know what
I mean, honestly.

433
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,627
Yeah, but it's
the effort that counts,
isn't it, Miriam?

434
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,601
And they do
enjoy themselves.

435
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:07,968
There's a lot of joy
in music, Mr. Yasgur.

436
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:12,903
And we'd love to
bring that joy to your
beautiful farm, wouldn't we?

437
00:30:17,949 --> 00:30:20,816
Now, I know it's
going to be something
of an imposition,

438
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:22,045
but we're more than
willing to do anything...

439
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:25,146
You say you want to
use these fields here?

440
00:30:25,223 --> 00:30:27,487
Then you'll be
needing the land
beside the barns as well,

441
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:30,117
I'm guessing,
for access to the roads.

442
00:30:30,195 --> 00:30:31,787
And parking.

443
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:34,923
Probably best
across 17B.

444
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:38,867
I own the piece
down the road, but there
are a couple of lots.

445
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:43,330
You'll probably
want to avoid dealing
with the Browns.

446
00:30:43,474 --> 00:30:46,966
And you'll clean
up after yourselves,
I'm hoping.

447
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,376
Of course.

448
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:51,574
Well,

449
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,346
would $5,000
do it for you?

450
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:00,952
Five?

451
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,925
But you'll have to tidy up,
and you'll have to pay

452
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:05,394
for any damaged crops,
of course.

453
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:15,001
Sure, Max.
That sounds fine.

454
00:31:16,975 --> 00:31:19,170
Good. Wonderful.

455
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,678
Well, why don't you
all come into the house
for some chocolate milk?

456
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,474
Far out.

457
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,447
You know,
we're gonna need a place
for people to crash

458
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,045
while we prepare
the festival.

459
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,613
Your place looks
pretty cool.

460
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:09,717
How many vacant rooms
do you have for the
next couple of weeks?

461
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,256
Well, it depends on
how you define room.

462
00:32:13,331 --> 00:32:15,026
You know,
how many people
can crash with you.

463
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,498
What do you guys charge?

464
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:20,503
Let's see. It's $8 a night,
but that can be for doubles,

465
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:22,539
and we give
a weekly discount,
of course.

466
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,737
Plus the cabins,
you can get cots,
so four people,

467
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,301
about 150, I'd say.

468
00:32:28,379 --> 00:32:31,143
You can get
about 200 people.
Hey, man, let's make it easy.

469
00:32:31,215 --> 00:32:34,378
Why don't we just
buy the El Monaco out
for the season?

470
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,852
Just figure out the costs,
write it down, and
we'll take a look.

471
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:38,013
And if we don't
use all the rooms,

472
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:39,283
you can rent out
the free ones.

473
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,052
We need to keep
some cleanup crews
around afterwards.

474
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:42,422
And if you've got
some bigger spaces,

475
00:32:42,493 --> 00:32:43,960
for offices,
that kind of thing.

476
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,326
We need to put in
some phones and have
some space to park vehicles.

477
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:48,058
You know where we're going?
Mmm-hmm.

478
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:53,231
There you go.
That's the...

479
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,365
Looks like we can
work with this, Elli.
Cool.

480
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:02,105
You know, I was thinking,
I've got that theater
troupe in the barn.

481
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,841
A theater troupe
in the barn?

482
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:07,679
Yeah, the Earthlight Players.
It's okay if they stay, right?

483
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:11,282
Maybe you guys could
find some work for
them or something.

484
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,586
They could really
use the pay.

485
00:33:14,225 --> 00:33:17,683
They're all hired, man.
Not a problem.
Great. Thanks.

486
00:33:19,697 --> 00:33:23,030
And I hope you don't mind,
but we like to pay cash

487
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,001
in advance.

488
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,943
And not only that,
he made me a local community
liaison for the festival,

489
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,611
and we're going to be
the exclusive local
ticket agency, too.

490
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:45,383
They think at least
5,000 people are gonna
buy tickets, or more.

491
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:49,283
Five thousand coming
here to White Lake?

492
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,393
Elli, you're an idiot.

493
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,328
Twenty people, thirty,
okay, for a weekend.

494
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,458
But 1,000, 5,000?
They'll steal everything.

495
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:58,263
Ma...
We'll be sued in

a farm for the kind of
money you're asking for.

I could buy five farms.

535
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:57,319
From what I read in
the papers, Mr. Roberts,

536
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,686
you've already
spent a million dollars
in Wallkill,

537
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,851
and you've only
got until the 15th
until your festival.

538
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,327
Now, I'm sure
a wealthy young man
such as yourself

539
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:07,762
could, indeed,
buy a lot of farms.

540
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,096
But that's neither
here nor there.
All I'm saying is...

541
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:13,934
Yeah, all you're saying
is that you've got us
over a barrel.

542
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:16,902

you wouldn't be on

when you make a deal
with me, it's a deal.

545
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:25,681
Okay? So long as
you promise to put
things back in order,

546
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,775
I'll stand by you 100%.

put you together here
with Max's vision.

558
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:02,543
Right. Look, Max,
if we were willing to
consider doing this,

559
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,417
you're really gonna have to
let us make it work.

560
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:08,447
Mike, listen, really,
if this doesn't
shake out with Max...

561
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,426

gonna be fine.

come together.

them near it.

the property down there.
You don't own the property?

and I own that,

I'm sure you'll be
willing to put up a bond,

a question?
Please.

00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:46,587
Is Mike for real?
I mean, he's so relaxed.

573
00:37:47,498 --> 00:37:52,128
Michael, yeah,
he's totally real,

574

so long as
the cash is real.

575

so long as John
and Joel are real.

576

are gonna stay real because,

you down for good.

654
00:44:01,605 --> 00:44:03,266
Have a nice day.

655
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,055
What's going on?

656
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,222
Your mother says we
can triple our money.

657
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,992
Three times the rooms.

658
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:30,533
You're kidding me.

659
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:36,164
They don't seem to mind.
Honest. These people,
they like it.

660
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,572
SONIA: I'm finished here,
you start on the bunking.

661
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,505
WOMAN: I don't know.
White Lake sounds
better than Wallkill.

662
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:43,409
Don't ask me why
they call it Woodstock.

663
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,448
Everyone's gonna drive
to the fucking real Woodstock

664
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,245
and be really bummed
when they get there.

665
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:50,684
DOT's letting us
put signage up.
Just not on the Thruway yet.

666
00:44:50,754 --> 00:44:52,278
But we're working on it.
We're gonna want to run lines

667
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:53,380
all the way
back to the fence.

668
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,754
MAN: Can you trench here?

669
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,487
No, man. Everything,
water pipes, juice,

670
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,119
all the cables
gotta run aboveground.

671
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,323
I got the
specs from Hanley,
for the speakers.

672

That's a lot of juice.

When Hendrix lights up,
there won't be a bird
left in Sullivan County.

Hey, I spoke to Wavy Gravy
and the Hog Farmers.

675
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:08,595
Wavy?
Yeah.

676
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:12,335
His real name's Hugh.
He's got 80 freaks,
the Hog Farmers.

677
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,673
They've got a commune
in the desert.

678
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:17,076
They drop more acid
than Timothy Leary.

679
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,479
There's 80 of them
coming in on a
jumbo jet next week.

680
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,781
Hey, man,
I can't find the
keys to my room.

681
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:24,252
Ask my mom.

682
00:45:24,822 --> 00:45:27,086
Hey, how's your room?
Fine, man.

683
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,625
Trip tents?
Yeah, where the kids
can come down...

684
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:32,253
From the trip.
WOMAN: Wait, wait.
What have you got here?

685
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:33,852
No, no.
Don't put it down there.

686
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,126
He and his people
are willing to work
with you on security.

687
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,226
You know,
they really like your
non-confrontational approach.

688
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,329
You know,
they wanna call it
a"Please Force."

689
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,071
Not sure how Fabbri's
going to like that moniker.

690
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,837
We're still going
to need real police.

691

(EXCLAIMS)

692
00:45:49,279 --> 00:45:51,008
Hey, Mike,
do you have a second?

693
00:45:51,148 --> 00:45:52,877
I'm just feeling
a little anxious.

694
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:54,417
Did Tisha tell you about
these code violations?

695
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:55,850
Hey, Elliot.
Just the man
I wanted to see.

696
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,250
You know,
I'm getting the feeling

697
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,618
that we're really
going to be able to use

698
00:45:58,689 --> 00:45:59,917
your community
relations skills.

699
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:00,979
My what skills?

700
00:46:01,058 --> 00:46:02,525
Because, Elli,
the rumors are
already swirling,

701
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:05,027
and we need to
put a local face
on the reality here.

702
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,461
And you, Elli,
are a local face.

703
00:46:07,531 --> 00:46:09,829
I'm a local face, yes,
but about these violations.

704
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,891
There's not a hotel
around for miles that
could pass inspection.

705
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,733
Those inspector dudes?
Don't worry about that, Elli.

706
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,137
Tisha told me all
about those guys.
Just give us the papers.

707
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,733
We've got some
heavy lawyers. Right?

708
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,210
Heavy lawyers. Right.

709
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,908
Because right now,
Elli, I need you
to focus

710
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:27,575
on the positive message
that we're sending.

711
00:46:27,651 --> 00:46:30,017
You know,
rapping with
the local townspeople,

712
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,487
finding some time
with some of the papers here.

713
00:46:32,556 --> 00:46:35,047
Wait, you mean like
a press conference?

714
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:40,222
A press conference. Yeah.
Radical idea, Elli.
I love it.

715
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,822
No, actually, you don't.
Me and public speaking,

716
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:45,095
I can guarantee you,
not one of my strong suits.

717
00:46:45,169 --> 00:46:46,295
I'm speaking from
experience here.

718
00:46:46,370 --> 00:46:49,032
Hey, Michael.
Hey. I want you
to meet somebody.

719
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,505
Let me introduce
you to Reverend Don.

720
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,201
He's helping with
our community outreach

721
00:46:52,276 --> 00:46:53,334
and he'd love it if
you could help him

722
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:56,038
get to know the locals.
Hi. It's really
great to meet you.

723
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:57,273
I don't know how
much Michael's told you,

724
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:58,608
but we're thinking
of putting on

725
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:00,513
a little free concert
for the local people here,

726
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:02,313
and we thought it
would be a great idea to

727
00:47:02,386 --> 00:47:03,910
include a scene from
your theater company.

728
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,921
Do you think
they'd be open to it?

729
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:10,016
Yeah, they'd love that.
But you said it's
for the locals?

730
00:47:10,627 --> 00:47:13,118
Because the play's
very contemporary.
Cool.

731
00:47:13,197 --> 00:47:15,961
Hey, hey, you guys,
the phones are alive.

732
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:20,262

00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:25,398
Hey, your dad wants you.

734
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,659
I'll get some paint,
but they're just
going to do it again.

735
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,860
They set foot here again,
I break their heads.

736
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:53,798
Dad, let me call...

737
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,807
Call who? That little

738
00:47:57,908 --> 00:47:59,637
he's the son of
that state trooper.

739
00:48:00,510 --> 00:48:03,343
I could boil him
and his <i>put</i>z of
a father in tar.

740
00:48:03,413 --> 00:48:07,110
Just, Dad,
let's just get this painted
before Mom sees it.

741
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,812
Then you can start
warming up the tar.

742
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,898
Thanks.

743
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,065
Put some more of
those in the cooler.

744
00:48:31,141 --> 00:48:33,200
Dad, this is all we got.

745
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,470
You didn't order more?

746
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:36,876
I did.
And I called Karpen's,
too, for the kitchen.

747
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:38,574
I asked them all to
bring 10 times our usual.

748
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:39,741
Well, when they
come tomorrow,

749
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:41,875
you tell them to
bring 20 times more.

750
00:48:41,952 --> 00:48:43,852
No, 30 times.

751
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,321
Where are we
going to put it all?

752
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:50,087
These people,
they eat and
drink like animals,

753
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:53,923
and there's more of
them every minute.

754
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:59,529
It doesn't matter
where we put it.
It'll be gone in a day.

00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,103
Yes?

with people showing up
without tickets?

could be considered,

you know, to be just
another word for being free.

no train to freedom. Train
has already left the station.

Maybe it was somebody else's?

any favorite places here,

He doesn't talk.

989
01:03:42,685 --> 01:03:47,782
I didn't say it was therapy
or anything, you know.
It was just chatting.

990
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:50,485
Chatting?
His mind must be going.

991
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:56,396
Don't worry, Elliot.
I'll keep an eye on him.

992
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:01,336
If he starts to laugh
or smile or anything
suspicious like that,

993
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,133
I'll let you know.

994

Hey, Mike.
Elli, you made it.

01:52:17,831 --> 01:52:21,699
Yeah, finally.
It's amazing.

Hey, thanks for calling
and welcoming us to your
international resort, man.
