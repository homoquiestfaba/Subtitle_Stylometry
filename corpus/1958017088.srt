Yeah, we don't charge by the foot.
We charge by the yard.

Sir, I do not want your 33¢.
And this is not about 33¢.

53
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,397
This is about the fact that I got 5 feet
of rope because I want 5 feet of rope.

54

And I shouldn't have to pay
for 6 feet of rope if I don't want 6 feet.

183
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:42,281
[in English] Yes! Exactly!
That's exactly what I was saying.

184
00:13:42,364 --> 00:13:45,909
-Hey, you can't just drive here.
-[radar beeping, then stops]

185
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,911
I'm not driving.
Am I driving the car? No.

186
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:50,247
You can't just bring a car
on this street without a permit.

187
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:53,542
No, we have a parking permit.
Right here. See?

188
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,669
What the hell's it doing in your pocket?!

189
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:57,462
Well, I'm the driver.

That doesn't mean you can back
the trailer up to your front door.

193
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:12,853
No, I wasn't. I was, uh, parallel parking.

194
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:14,021
Parallel to what?

195
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,359
Yeah, that, uh, didn't go so well, huh?

196
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,153
I'll just give it another try.

-I'm sorry.

this far through life

without knowing how to back up a trailer.

215
00:14:57,481 --> 00:15:01,401
My God, a dog with one front paw and
cataracts coulda done better than that.

216
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:03,820
And an automatic, of course.
Give me the keys.

217
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,532
Oh, they're in the cupholder.

218
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:08,242
It's a push-button start.

219
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,493
No, I knew that.

Uh, that's the radar.

223
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:17,960
The trailer's too close
to the side of the car.

224
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,837
That's why it's still beeping, but--

225
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:20,963
Okay.

226
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:24,424

<i>-Perfecto!
</i>-Thank you, sir.

238
00:16:10,554 --> 00:16:13,724
Anyone who thinks
they need to use radar to back up a car

239
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,309
shouldn't be allowed to drive one.

240

They shouldn't be allowed
to use the radio.

241

That's what I said.

242
00:16:18,854 --> 00:16:21,857
And the permit goes on
the rear-view mirror. Not in your pocket!

243
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,442
-[in English] Okay, okay.
-Got it.

Why?

277

Because you looked hungry.

That's why we go so well together.

Maybe I should just run myself

[grunts] There was a deal on 'em.

What idiot thought that was a good name
for a real estate company?

00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,242
Sounds like "dying America."

It is, of course.

All right.

-Yay!

Ah. Otto, <i>pero</i> can we go in our car?

1061
01:05:07,115 --> 01:05:09,535
Because I've only ever driven automatic.

1062
01:05:09,618 --> 01:05:10,577
[Otto] No.

1063
01:05:10,661 --> 01:05:13,664

Now, coming up on the red light.
You're going to have to stop.

1067
01:05:21,547 --> 01:05:23,382
Okay, but I get the clutch, right?

1068
01:05:23,465 --> 01:05:26,301
You get the clutch
and then press in on the brake.

1069
01:05:26,385 --> 01:05:29,471
-Do I hit the brake or the clutch?
-No, keep the clutch in.

1070
01:05:29,555 --> 01:05:31,473
Put in the brake, I put the clutch.

1071
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:33,475
Clutch and brake. And now brake.

Clutch in, and brake.
Brake. Brake. Brake.

The car is stopped.
Don't hit the car! Brake, brake!

Yes. All right, let go.

-You're learning.

Oh, my God, I almost hit the car.
It's like this.

1086
01:06:05,048 --> 01:06:07,092
It doesn't matter. It's a hybrid.

1087
01:06:07,176 --> 01:06:08,385
It's a hybrid, okay.

01:06:09,011 --> 01:06:11,430
-Okay, I should move back.
-No, no, no. No.

-But I'm very close.

[Otto] What is wrong with you?

She's learning how to drive.

1110

Did you not have to learn how to drive?

1111
01:06:55,516 --> 01:06:58,685
Calm down, old man. Hey, hey.

1112
01:06:58,769 --> 01:07:02,147
I'm not your old man! You son of a bitch!

1113

If you honk that horn one more time,

01:07:05,609 --> 01:07:08,153
it'll be the last thing you do.
You hear me? Huh?

Oh, shit.

1117
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:18,413
Now you listen to me.

1118
01:07:19,248 --> 01:07:22,709
You have given birth to two children.
Soon it'll be three.

1119
01:07:22,793 --> 01:07:26,630
You have come here
from a country very far away.

1120
01:07:26,713 --> 01:07:28,298
You learned a new language,

1121
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:30,884
you got yourself an education
and a nitwit husband

1122
01:07:30,968 --> 01:07:33,053
and you are holding that family together.

1123
01:07:33,136 --> 01:07:35,639
You will have no problem
learning how to drive.

My God,
the world is full of complete idiots

who have managed to figure it out,
and you are not a complete idiot.

1126

So...

[Otto] Okay, there's a spot right there.

Just pull up, parallel,

1137

and back the car up until that bumper
is in line with your side-view mirror.

1138
01:08:26,023 --> 01:08:27,274
Now straighten out.

1139

Back up all the way up to the curb.

-Well, a little bit.

1141

-Yes.

How did you find this place?

This was Sonya's place.

1160
01:09:21,036 --> 01:09:23,580
We used to come here
every Saturday at 1:00.

1161
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:27,417
And then? What?

1162
01:09:28,001 --> 01:09:29,252
Go home at 2:00.

1163
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:32,548
I'd wash and wax the car,

1164
01:09:32,631 --> 01:09:37,176
and she would grade her papers and cook
and spend the rest of the day reading.

1165
01:09:37,803 --> 01:09:39,095
What kind of books?

1166
01:09:40,346 --> 01:09:41,974
-Her books.

1167
01:09:43,267 --> 01:09:45,519

I'm just...

1169
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:48,522
I'm not into books.

01:09:49,982 --> 01:09:52,109
Her friends said
that we were like night and day.

1171
01:09:55,279 --> 01:09:57,698
My life was black-and-white
before I met Sonya.

I would have liked her.

1175
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:06,415
She was a force of nature.

1176
01:10:07,541 --> 01:10:10,627
She convinced the school
to start up a programme

1177
01:10:10,711 --> 01:10:12,254
for the kids that needed extra help.

1178
01:10:12,337 --> 01:10:14,548
A lot of kids had problems at home

1179
01:10:14,631 --> 01:10:17,718
or, uh, social anxieties.

1180
01:10:18,343 --> 01:10:21,096
But by the time Sonya was done with 'em,

1181
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:22,764
they were reciting Shakespeare.

1182
01:10:26,643 --> 01:10:29,104

that drove everybody crazy.</i>

a forest up on that hill.</i>

<i>That's why they call it Birchwood.</i>

1206
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,339
<i>Then they started building
all those condos</i>

1207
01:11:37,422 --> 01:11:38,674
<i>and cut down all the birches.</i>

1208
01:11:38,757 --> 01:11:41,677
They didn't even realise
what they were doing until we told them,

1209

Reuben and I.

1210
01:11:43,470 --> 01:11:45,013
But this was before the coup?

01:11:45,097 --> 01:11:47,850
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Reuben and I were friends then.

1212
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:51,478
After that,
all we saw were the differences.

[quirky tense music playing]

A few years later, their son, Chris,
he, uh, took a job in Japan,

he's been back to visit them since.

Hey.

01:12:41,653 --> 01:12:44,156
Sonya gave me this a while back.

1221

Never found the occasion.

[quirky tense music continues]

1224
01:12:53,999 --> 01:12:56,210
Hey, would you like to see my new car?

1225
01:12:57,836 --> 01:12:58,962
Sure.

1226
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:00,214
It's a new model.

1227
01:13:00,881 --> 01:13:02,341
Just came out.

1228
01:13:07,971 --> 01:13:09,014
Voilà.

1229
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:12,476
A Toyota?

1230
01:13:14,102 --> 01:13:15,979
You bought a Toyota.

1231
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:18,023
Celica GT convertible.

1232
01:13:18,106 --> 01:13:20,526
Five-speed automatic.

1233
01:13:21,193 --> 01:13:23,153
You gotta change with the times.

1234
01:13:24,071 --> 01:13:25,197
Otto!

1235
01:13:27,032 --> 01:13:31,036
I don't know what went wrong with Reuben,
but that's when I knew I'd lost him.

1236
01:13:31,119 --> 01:13:33,288
I mean, a man has to stand up
for what he believes in.

1237
01:13:33,372 --> 01:13:36,041
Even if it is an F-O-R-D.

1238
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:37,292
[Marisol chuckles]

1239
01:13:39,253 --> 01:13:43,632
And you and Sonya,
did you ever think about having children?

1240
01:13:47,678 --> 01:13:49,596
Well, 2:00.

1241
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:52,975
Okay.

1242
01:13:54,810 --> 01:13:55,811
Yes.

1243
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:03,819
I was wondering
if you could help us out tonight.

1244
01:14:03,902 --> 01:14:06,613
Me and Tommy don't get a lot of time
to go out for dinner

1245
01:14:06,697 --> 01:14:07,990
before the baby comes.

1246
01:14:08,073 --> 01:14:10,409
I'm not gonna drive you two
around on a date.

1247
01:14:10,993 --> 01:14:13,871
No. We're gonna take a cab.

1248
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:16,707
What do you need me for, then?

1249
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:19,960
-Mama, I did not! Why would I?
-Yes, you did!

1250
01:14:20,043 --> 01:14:21,795
-Give it back!
-You gotta catch me!

1251
01:14:21,879 --> 01:14:23,714
You guys, <i>por favor</i>.

1252
01:14:23,797 --> 01:14:26,008
-[Marisol yelling in Spanish]
-[door slams]

1253
01:14:28,468 --> 01:14:30,762
[in English]
And learn to share your everything.

1254
01:14:30,846 --> 01:14:32,014
[speaks in Spanish]

1255
01:14:32,097 --> 01:14:33,640
I'm not sure about this.

1256
01:14:33,724 --> 01:14:36,727
[in English] No. Don't be silly.
It's gonna be very fun.

1257
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,606
If you remember,
Abbie has to be in bed by 9:00, okay?

1258
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,024
-You're good?
-[grunts]

1259
01:14:43,525 --> 01:14:46,862
So, alarm code, 4491. 4491.

1260
01:14:46,945 --> 01:14:50,115
I'm setting it to "Armed Stay."
Are you paying attention?

1261
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:51,825
So if you wanna go out,

1262
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:55,162
you just have to press this button here,
and it's disalarmed.

1263
01:14:55,245 --> 01:14:56,997
I'll be right here.

1264
01:14:58,081 --> 01:14:59,333
Right. Yeah.

1265
01:15:00,292 --> 01:15:01,668
Well, you never know.

1266
01:15:01,752 --> 01:15:03,504
[Marisol]
Be good to <i>Abuelo </i>Otto please, okay?

1267
01:15:03,587 --> 01:15:04,713
[Abbie] We will!

1268
01:15:08,926 --> 01:15:10,636
I don't see chocolate milk in here.

1269
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,473
You make it with the syrup.
But not too much. It'll keep her awake.

1270
01:15:16,642 --> 01:15:17,935
[Abbie] Give me milk.

1271
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:19,269
What is that?

1272
01:15:19,353 --> 01:15:22,231
That's the goddamn useless dishwasher.

1273
01:15:23,941 --> 01:15:26,485
Dad said he wanted
to throw it out the window,

1274
01:15:26,568 --> 01:15:28,987
but Mom said Dad isn't allowed
to open windows anymore.

1275
01:15:34,785 --> 01:15:35,786
[Abbie] Head.

1276
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:37,871
<i>Cabeza</i>.

1277
01:15:38,664 --> 01:15:40,499
<i>-Cabeza.
-Cabeza.</i>

1278
01:15:40,582 --> 01:15:41,458
Good.

1279
01:15:42,334 --> 01:15:43,210

1280

Arm. <i>Brazo.</i>

1285
01:15:54,429 --> 01:15:55,305
Good.

1286
01:16:01,186 --> 01:16:03,230
[Otto] I don't think this is a good idea.

1287
01:16:03,313 --> 01:16:04,523
Why?

1288
01:16:05,649 --> 01:16:08,485
Because no one stands a chance
against a <i>luchadoro</i>.

1289
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:10,988
<i>Abuelo Luchadoro!</i>

Help me, help me.

1292
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:17,703
Wait, no, he started it.

1293
01:16:18,662 --> 01:16:20,998
-Ready?
-Rub it and smack!

1294
01:16:21,707 --> 01:16:24,710
Rub it and smack! Smack! Karate chop!

[Abbie & Luna speaking indistinctly]

1297
01:16:35,929 --> 01:16:36,930
[Otto] Huh.

[both whispering in Spanish]

1299
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:03,373

Hi.

01:17:14,301 --> 01:17:15,969
She was already asleep.

[in English] How was it?

1308
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:23,310
-Fine.
-You did a good job tonight, Otto.

1309
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:24,937
You should pat yourself on the back.

-[Tommy] Thank you, Otto.
-[Otto] Yeah.

Okay.

01:17:57,261 --> 01:17:58,428

-[Malcolm] Hi, Otto.
-Malcolm.

1317
01:18:07,271 --> 01:18:11,024
You can't hear your chain rattle
when you switch gears like that?

1318
01:18:11,108 --> 01:18:13,652
-My bike's getting old.
-Don't blame the bike.

1319
01:18:13,735 --> 01:18:15,654
You just have to adjust your derailleur.

1320
01:18:16,905 --> 01:18:19,533
-My what?
-Your derailleur needs adjusting.

1321
01:18:23,203 --> 01:18:24,997
Uh, excuse me.

-Hi, I'm Shari Kenzie.
-Hi.

1323
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:29,084
I'm a social media journalist.

1324
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:32,337
I'm, um, looking for Otto Anderson.

1325
01:18:32,421 --> 01:18:34,423
Are you sure you wanna do that?

1326
01:18:40,888 --> 01:18:44,099
Wow. It's great. That's amazing.

1327
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:46,351
You treat it right, it'll treat you right.

1328
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:48,270
Here. Keep the set.

1329
01:18:48,353 --> 01:18:49,479
Thanks, Otto.

1330
01:18:50,272 --> 01:18:54,776
I can't believe I'm helping you
throw crap onto people's lawns.

1331
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:56,195
Isn't two jobs enough?

1332
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,864
I'm saving up for a car.

1333
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:00,282
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1334
01:19:00,365 --> 01:19:01,909
What kind?

1335
01:19:01,992 --> 01:19:03,118
Volkswagen.

Young lady, you're blocking the garage.

1339
01:19:13,795 --> 01:19:16,965
Mr Anderson? My name is Shari Kenzie.

1340
01:19:17,049 --> 01:19:19,551
I'm a social media journalist, and I--

1341
01:19:19,635 --> 01:19:20,969
What is that?

1342
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:24,640
I have an online series
called <i>Everyday Heroes</i>.

1343
01:19:24,723 --> 01:19:27,726
What you did the other day
at the train station was amazing.

1344
01:19:27,809 --> 01:19:29,144
You saved that man's life.

1345
01:19:29,228 --> 01:19:30,646
You have the wrong guy.

1346
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:35,400
No, I don't. I've watched the video
at least a dozen times.

1347
01:19:35,484 --> 01:19:36,944
-It's you.
-Video?

1348
01:19:37,027 --> 01:19:38,362
You haven't seen it?

1349
01:19:38,445 --> 01:19:42,157
Oh. A commuter recorded what happened
on their phone and posted it online.

1350
01:19:42,241 --> 01:19:45,953
Someone in the comments recognised you.
That's how I tracked you down.

1351
01:19:46,036 --> 01:19:47,955
It's gotten over a million views.

1352
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:49,790
A million? A million.

1353
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:52,167
Why can't people mind their own business?

1354
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:55,629
Because stories like yours are inspiring.

1355
01:19:55,712 --> 01:19:57,840
If I could just talk to you
for a few minutes--

1356
01:19:57,923 --> 01:20:00,342
No, now I've got too many things
I have to do.

1357
01:20:00,425 --> 01:20:02,719
I recorded a video message
from the man you saved.

1358
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:03,929
You should see this.

1359
01:20:04,012 --> 01:20:06,056
-Um... just pull it up.
-[Marisol] Otto! Hi!

1360
01:20:06,932 --> 01:20:08,058
Good morning.

1361
01:20:09,101 --> 01:20:09,977
Good morning.

1362
01:20:11,603 --> 01:20:12,604
[Shari] Uh...

1363
01:20:12,688 --> 01:20:15,315
-So you ready for another driving lesson?
-[pounding on garage door]

1364
01:20:15,399 --> 01:20:17,317
-Now's not a good time.
-No?

01:20:17,401 --> 01:20:19,611
[Shari]
Hello? Hello? Hey, I'm still in here!

1366
01:20:19,695 --> 01:20:21,405
-I didn't lock you in.
-[Shari] Hello?

1367
01:20:21,488 --> 01:20:23,699
Turn the knob, open the door.

1368
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:26,076
-[speaks in Spanish]
-Opened a door before, haven't you?

1369
01:20:26,159 --> 01:20:27,160
Idiot.

1370
01:20:29,788 --> 01:20:31,957
[Marisol in English] Otto! It's me.

1371
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,125
She's gone.

1372
01:20:34,543 --> 01:20:36,503
Good. I'm not through with my rounds.

1373
01:20:38,088 --> 01:20:39,965
"Social media journalist"?

1374
01:20:40,048 --> 01:20:41,508
What the hell does that even mean?

1375
01:20:42,301 --> 01:20:45,429
Buncha knotheads pointin'
a camera at themselves.

1376
01:20:45,512 --> 01:20:47,181
I thought you handled it really well.

1377
01:20:47,264 --> 01:20:49,308
I mean, closing her in your garage.

1378
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:53,020
That was, like, excellent strategy.

1379
01:20:53,103 --> 01:20:55,898
-[growls]
-Good job. [laughs]

1380
01:20:58,567 --> 01:21:02,112
Otto, also, I was thinking
you've done so much for us.

1381
01:21:02,196 --> 01:21:05,115
-I wanna do something for you too.
-I don't need anything.

1382
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:08,952
Well, I think you could do
with some decent food. Sometimes. No?

1383
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:10,120
Those cookies...

1384
01:21:10,204 --> 01:21:11,747
The what? The <i>"salporanz"?</i>

1385
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,208
Those are not bad. They're not bad.

1386
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:16,418
And, also, I was thinking

1387
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:20,923
that I can help you clean out your house
and clean out the front hall in your home,

1388
01:21:21,006 --> 01:21:24,384
and help you pack the coats and shoes
you have there of Sonya's.

1389
01:21:24,468 --> 01:21:25,677
That's not needed.

1390
01:21:26,386 --> 01:21:29,515
No, but it can help you move on.

1391
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:31,225
I don't wanna move on.

1392
01:21:31,308 --> 01:21:33,143
She's always gonna be with you.

01:35:17,217 --> 01:35:19,678
They convinced Anita to sell the house.

1568
01:35:19,761 --> 01:35:21,680
No, they made the deal with Chris.

1569
01:35:21,763 --> 01:35:24,433
-Chris? He can't do that.
-Yeah, he can.

1570
01:35:24,516 --> 01:35:27,686
After Dye & Merika found out
Anita had Parkinson's,

1571
01:35:27,769 --> 01:35:29,730
they tracked Chris down and--

1572
01:35:29,813 --> 01:35:30,939
-Parkinson's?
-Yeah.

1573
01:35:31,023 --> 01:35:33,984
So last year Chris convinced Anita
to give him power of attorney

1574
01:35:34,067 --> 01:35:35,360
in case she got worse.

1575
01:35:35,444 --> 01:35:38,447
So Dye & Merika made the deal
with Chris to buy the house.

1576
01:35:38,530 --> 01:35:39,615
Those pricks.

1577
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:44,244
Wait, Anita found out
she had Parkinson's last year?

1578
01:35:44,953 --> 01:35:46,038
No, that's not right.

1579
01:35:46,121 --> 01:35:48,916
She would've told Sonya.
Sonya would've told me.

1580
01:35:50,125 --> 01:35:53,879
Well, Anita and Reuben
didn't want you and Sonya to know.

1581
01:35:53,962 --> 01:35:56,757
They said you had enough
on your plate as it is.

1582
01:35:58,425 --> 01:35:59,510
They said that?

1583
01:36:03,013 --> 01:36:06,016
[lively pensive music playing]

1584
01:36:10,812 --> 01:36:14,066
I need to see everything
you ever got from Dye & Merika.

1585
01:36:14,149 --> 01:36:17,236
Notices, letters. Do you have
a copy of the power of attorney?

1586
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:18,946
How do you know about that?

1587
01:36:19,029 --> 01:36:20,614
-Do you have it?
-Yes.

1588
01:36:20,697 --> 01:36:21,698
-Get it.
-Yes.

1589
01:36:23,617 --> 01:36:28,580
And any records
of Reuben's condition and yours.

1590
01:36:28,664 --> 01:36:30,457
Did Jimmy tell you that?

1591
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:31,959
Can you get it now?

1592
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:33,043
Yes.

1593
01:36:39,216 --> 01:36:40,342
I've been an idiot.

1594
01:36:42,344 --> 01:36:45,722
I got so wrapped up in my own troubles,
I stopped thinking of anyone else.

1595
01:36:45,806 --> 01:36:48,141
And I figured
they weren't thinking about me.

1596
01:36:48,225 --> 01:36:49,852
[inhales deeply]

1597
01:36:49,935 --> 01:36:51,520
Friends shouldn't do that.

1598
01:36:51,603 --> 01:36:52,604
So...

1599
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:56,942
This isn't easy to say
after all this time.

1600
01:36:57,985 --> 01:36:59,111
But I'm sorry.

1601
01:37:01,989 --> 01:37:04,157
And I will sort all this out.

1602
01:37:07,536 --> 01:37:10,539
[lively pensive music continues]

1603
01:37:17,129 --> 01:37:18,297
I need to use your phone.

1604
01:37:20,549 --> 01:37:22,217
Why can't you use your own?

1605
01:37:23,218 --> 01:37:25,053
Mine is disconnected at the moment.

1606
01:37:27,306 --> 01:37:29,725
-Why?
-That doesn't matter.

1607
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:31,852
I just need to use your phone, okay?

1608
01:37:33,896 --> 01:37:35,063
You know what?

1609
01:37:35,147 --> 01:37:36,148
No.

1610
01:37:36,231 --> 01:37:37,691
-No?
-No.

1611
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:41,528
You won't tell me
why your phone is disconnected?

1612
01:37:41,612 --> 01:37:44,948
You won't tell me
why you need to use my phone?

1613
01:37:45,032 --> 01:37:48,160
You won't tell me what happened
to you in the street yesterday?

1614
01:37:48,827 --> 01:37:51,955
And then you went inside
and you wouldn't even open the door?

1615
01:37:53,874 --> 01:37:55,459
You scared me, Otto.

1616
01:37:57,211 --> 01:37:59,254
Do you know how long I was out there?

1617
01:37:59,338 --> 01:38:02,299
And I didn't know
if something had happened to you.

1618
01:38:03,717 --> 01:38:05,802
Or if something was gonna happen to you.

1619
01:38:07,095 --> 01:38:10,557
And I'm sorry if I said
the wrong thing about Sonya's coats.

1620
01:38:10,641 --> 01:38:12,059
But I was just trying to help.

1621
01:38:13,477 --> 01:38:16,396
And you left me out there.

1622
01:38:18,398 --> 01:38:21,193
So, no. You can't use my phone.

1623
01:38:27,241 --> 01:38:30,577
You think your life is so hard
because everybody's an idiot

1624
01:38:30,661 --> 01:38:32,579
and you have to do everything
on your own, right?

1625
01:38:34,164 --> 01:38:34,998
Right?

1626
01:38:36,333 --> 01:38:37,334
But guess what.

1627
01:38:38,460 --> 01:38:39,670
You can't.

1628
01:38:40,921 --> 01:38:41,922
No one can.

1629
01:38:43,340 --> 01:38:44,967
And I think you should just be happy

1630
01:38:45,050 --> 01:38:47,386
that someone was trying
to help you get through a crappy day.

1631
01:38:49,054 --> 01:38:50,556
Even if they're an idiot.

1632
01:38:51,723 --> 01:38:54,059
-So...
-The real estate bastards

1633
01:38:54,142 --> 01:38:57,104
are trying to force
Anita and Reuben out of their home.

1634
01:38:57,855 --> 01:38:59,398
That's why I need to use your phone.

1635
01:39:03,193 --> 01:39:04,945
Okay, fine. Come on.

1636
01:39:21,461 --> 01:39:23,338
We had never had a vacation.

1637
01:39:25,215 --> 01:39:27,634
[poignant music playing]

1638
01:39:27,718 --> 01:39:29,261
Sonya was six months pregnant.

1639
01:39:30,554 --> 01:39:34,224
And she wanted to do something special
before the baby came.

1640
01:39:35,017 --> 01:39:37,519
So we booked a trip to Niagara Falls.

1641
01:39:39,563 --> 01:39:41,440
On the way back, the bus crashed.

1642
01:39:43,233 --> 01:39:45,694
There'd been a recall on the brake lines,

1643
01:39:45,777 --> 01:39:47,821
but the company never had them fixed.

1644
01:39:49,489 --> 01:39:50,866
Sonya was paralyzed...

1645
01:39:52,451 --> 01:39:54,453
and we lost our son.

1646
01:39:58,373 --> 01:40:00,792
<i>After three months,
she was finally able to come home.</i>

1647
01:40:01,877 --> 01:40:04,796
<i>But they had started building
the new condos</i>

1648
01:40:04,880 --> 01:40:08,091
<i>and the community centre
and the walkways,</i>

1649
01:40:08,175 --> 01:40:11,303
<i>none of which were designed
for people in wheelchairs.</i>

1650
01:40:12,179 --> 01:40:14,806
The builders could have
changed their plans.

1651
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:20,062
But the laws weren't in place back then,
and they didn't care.

1652
01:40:20,687 --> 01:40:21,772
<i>I did.</i>

1653
01:40:21,855 --> 01:40:25,234
-We're putting in a new playground...
-<i>I cared.</i>

1654
01:40:25,317 --> 01:40:28,070
<i>-There's places for people like your wife.
</i>-And I was so angry.

1655
01:40:28,153 --> 01:40:31,240
What does that mean?
People like her? What does that mean?

1656
01:40:31,323 --> 01:40:33,784
-What're you tryin' to say?!
-[yells]<i> Get off of me!</i>

1657
01:40:34,493 --> 01:40:38,830
That's when they voted me out
as head of the homeowners' association.

1658
01:40:41,041 --> 01:40:43,085
I wanted to obliterate them all.

1659
01:40:43,168 --> 01:40:46,922
The builders, and the realtors,
and the bus company, the bus driver.

1660
01:40:47,005 --> 01:40:48,632
I never would have let it go...

1661
01:40:50,342 --> 01:40:51,343
but for Sonya.

1662
01:40:52,886 --> 01:40:54,555
Sonya said we had to keep living.

1663
01:40:57,808 --> 01:40:58,892
That's what I did.

1664
01:41:00,519 --> 01:41:01,770
I lived for Sonya.

1665
01:41:06,358 --> 01:41:08,026
Six months ago she passed away.

1666
01:41:08,902 --> 01:41:09,903
<i>Cancer.</i>

[whimpers]

1668
01:41:14,157 --> 01:41:15,450
I was going to join her.

1669
01:41:17,286 --> 01:41:19,663
That's why I had them disconnect my phone.

1670
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:25,794
But now I think
she wants me to keep living.

1671
01:41:28,422 --> 01:41:31,175
And I have things to do.

1672

You're wasting your time, Otto.

1676

It's a done deal. Reuben's coming with us.

1677
01:42:07,503 --> 01:42:09,546
And if you get in our way,

1678
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:10,881
I'll have you arrested.

-Don't you take another step.

You are not taking my husband
away from me.

Anita, please.
We're doing this for your own good.

1682
01:42:21,391 --> 01:42:24,478
What you're doing
is trying to take my property.

1683
01:42:25,354 --> 01:42:29,608
{\an8}I want Reuben to stay right here
for the rest of his life,

1684
01:42:29,691 --> 01:42:31,610
with me in our home.

1685
01:42:31,693 --> 01:42:35,864
Okay, but who's gonna take care of Reuben
when you're no longer able to?

Who's gonna take care of you? Otto?

01:42:38,450 --> 01:42:41,453
Otto's not in the best health either.
Are you, Otto?

1688
01:42:42,579 --> 01:42:43,789
[Jimmy] I'll take care of 'em.

1689
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:48,585
-What are you doing? Put that down.
-Anita and Reuben are like family to me.

1690
01:42:48,669 --> 01:42:50,420
I'll take care of them

They're not your family.

Uh, their son, Chris, has decided
they're not fit enough to be on their own,

1693
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:58,220
and so what we're doing is--

1694
01:42:58,303 --> 01:43:01,640
Excuse me. When was the last time
Chris saw his parents?

1695
01:43:01,723 --> 01:43:05,394
He lives in Japan.
They've been estranged for 10 years.

1696
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:07,771
Chris would have no idea
how his parents are doing,

1697
01:43:07,855 --> 01:43:09,523
except for what you told him.

1698
01:43:09,606 --> 01:43:11,441
Okay. And who are you?

1699
01:43:11,525 --> 01:43:13,402
My name is Shari Kenzie.

-Uh...

1702
01:43:18,365 --> 01:43:21,785
{\an8}All right, all right,
shut that camera off. You can't film this.

1703
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:23,662
It's a public sidewalk.

1704
01:43:24,329 --> 01:43:26,999
You told Anita's son, Chris,
that she had Parkinson's,

1705
01:43:27,082 --> 01:43:30,878
{\an8}but Anita never told anyone
about her diagnosis.

1706
01:43:30,961 --> 01:43:33,046
{\an8}So how did you know?

1707
01:43:33,130 --> 01:43:35,257
I'd have to check the records.

1708
01:43:36,133 --> 01:43:38,969
Mr Anderson over there
is something of a local hero.

about his private health records as well.

[Jimmy] Bye, thank you!

1719
01:44:05,537 --> 01:44:08,457
{\an8}I first uploaded Anita and Chris's story
an hour ago.
