they got a goddamn taser,

178
00:07:41,828 --> 00:07:43,862
[Bleep]ing mace, goddamn ticket book,

179
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:45,497
[Bleep]ing whistles, godda...

180
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,933
Goddamn walkie-Talkie
on that mother[bleep]er.

181
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,669
[Bleep]ing lie detector, dna tester.

182
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:53,805
Breathalyzer,
got a [bleep]ing breathalyzer.

183
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,509
Goddamn coffee maker
on that mother[bleep]er.

184
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,878
That's a whole lot of bullshit.

185
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,880
When you hop out that
goddamn car and start running,

186
00:08:01,948 --> 00:08:05,016
The first thing a cop
is thinking is, "goddamn.

187
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:07,185
"He gonna make me chase his ass

188
00:08:07,253 --> 00:08:12,424
With all this bullshit
on this belt!"

189
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:13,859
[Screams]
"god!"

190
00:08:13,926 --> 00:08:16,761
[Thumping]

191
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,510
Coffee spilling.
[Shrieks]

192
00:08:31,577 --> 00:08:36,515
"I'm gonna kill your ass!"

193
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:39,251
You got a backup cop hanging
off, a backup cop over here.

194
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:43,755
Another dude like...
[Stammering]

195
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,090
"Make a left, make a left, make a left.

196
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,294
[Thumping]

197
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,763
Left, mother[bleep]er,
left, left, left, left."

198
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:52,964
"Your left, your left,
my left?"

199
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:57,869
"My left, mother[bleep]er,
my left!"

200
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:01,273
You gotta be in shape
to escape two damn cops, right?

201
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,742
You want to steal, right?

202
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,277
Have your ass in shape.

203
00:09:05,344 --> 00:09:08,380
Your ass gotta be in shape to steal.

204
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:09,648
Get your ass in the gym.

205
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:10,949
Get your wind up.

206
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,317
Get your strength up.
Right?

207
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,687
You will frustrate the [bleep]
out of a police officer

208
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:17,389
If he can't catch your ass.

209
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,792
"This guy's incredible.

210
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,428
"This guy knew this day was gonna come.

211
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:26,298
"He is prepared for our ass.

212
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:28,233
I'm gonna run out of gas on
this mother[bleep]er right now."

213
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:31,336
Get your ass in the gym.
Get in the goddamn gym.

214
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,604
And get on that [bleep]ing treadmill.

215
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,771
You get on the [bleep]ing treadmill

216
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,640
And you work that shit.

217
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,882
I'ma steal everything.

218
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,092
I'm gonna get this goddamn wind up,

219
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,896
And the police can't [bleep] with me!

220
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,197
You jogging.

221
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,865
There's a white man on his treadmill,

222
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,168
A nosy-Ass white man
on his treadmill next to you.

223
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:11,409
"Are you a new member?"

224
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:13,445
Shut the [bleep] up!

225
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,359
I'm training to steal some shit, bitch.

226
00:10:27,426 --> 00:10:30,261
Give me that goddamn ipod.

227
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,275
[Laughs]

228
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,414
Got to go to the gym, man, right?

229
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,149
And work your ass out, get strong.

230
00:10:51,217 --> 00:10:52,817
See, I go to the gym.
I try... I try to go to gym,

231
00:10:52,884 --> 00:10:54,452
A little workout.

232
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,054
I get irritated when I go to gym.

233
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,023
Soon as I walk in the gym, I get irritated.

234
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,290
You know why?

235
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:01,426
'Cause everything is so damn heavy.

236
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,362
All this shit.

237
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,736
Ain't no light shit in here?

238
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:20,945
[Shrieking]

239
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:25,550
What the [bleep] is this?

240
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:26,685
My new gym's so damn heavy,

241
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:29,187
The door to get in that shit heavy.

242
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:30,455
I'd be like, goddamn,

243
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,190
How the [bleep]
you get in this goddamn gym?

244
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,191
What kind of door is this?

245
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:34,759
Goddamn.

246
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,362
[Screams]

247
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,964
What kind of goddamn door is this?

248
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,633
[Bleep].

249
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:46,838
Whew, how the [bleep]
do you get in this goddamn gym?

250
00:11:46,906 --> 00:11:49,708
Hey, man, people outside can't get in!

251
00:11:49,775 --> 00:11:52,877
What kind of goddamn door is this?

252
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,646
I got to wait outside for somebody to leave

253
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,947
To get in the goddamn gym.

254
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,682
If somebody leave,

255
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,017
I'll slide up in this mother[bleep]er.

256
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:01,252
Hold the door, hold that goddamn door,

257
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,687
Hold the door, hold the door.

258
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,422
Goddamn.

259
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,658
I'm in the gym.

260
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,860
I don't know how I'm gonna leave,

261
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:11,262
But I'm up in this mother[bleep]er.

262
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,464
I gotta pull a fire alarm to leave.

263
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:16,134
We all leaving at the same goddamn time.

264
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,374
- You ask a stupid ass question,
you get a damn statement.

265
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:25,076
'Cause that's how I dooz it.

266
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:26,845
Yeah.

267
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:29,981
You don't want to mess around
with them damn police.

268
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:31,616
You don't mess around
with the damn police, man.

269
00:12:31,683 --> 00:12:32,951
Cops don't be playing.

270
00:12:33,018 --> 00:12:34,719
They grab your ass.
They bend your wrist like this.

271
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:37,155
The first move, they bend
your damn wrist like this.

272
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:38,556
They turn it, they pull that shit,

273
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:40,592
And they rip that mo...
[Groans]

274
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,127
Put your face on the damn car like this.

275
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:45,263
Oh, oh, my god, damn, okay,
okay, okay, okay, okay.

276
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:47,165
Okay, officer, okay!

277
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:50,535
You're hurting my arm!

278
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,003
You've got to tell that damn officer,

279
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:56,908
"Officer, there's a ligament
in this [bleep]ing arm."

280
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,213
The whole body is loaded with ligaments.

281
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,783
Ligaments run the body.

282
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,918
Your body is full of [bleep]ing ligaments.

283
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:10,488
[Laughs]

284
00:13:10,556 --> 00:13:12,590
A lot of people think your body
is 75% water

285
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,259
Or whatever it is.

286
00:13:14,326 --> 00:13:18,763
It's 75% ligaments.

287
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:19,998
That officer bend your damn arm

288
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,132
And twist your wrist like this.

289
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,434
And you're [bleep]ing...
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

290
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:26,671
And you mess around and rip that
ligament while he twisting it,

291
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,306
Guess what you're stuck with
for three months.

292
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:33,011
This right here.

293
00:13:33,078 --> 00:13:36,114
I don't give a damn
how handsome your ass is.

294
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:38,950
You walk in the club
with this right here...

295
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,858
The whole body jacked up, right?

296
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:49,360
The pants crooked,
you got the pants over here.

297
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,830
You look like this.

298
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:00,271
You done jacked up your damn ligament.

299
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:03,074
Now your ligament all jacked up, right?

300
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:05,376
You walk into a club with this right here,

301
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,378
Believe me, heads will turn.

302
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:09,414
"What up, playboy?
What's going on, fools?"

303
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:10,815
"What the hell
happened to you?"

304
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:15,687
"Man, the police done
[bleep]ed up my ligament."

305
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,156
This ain't good for nothing, right?

306
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:19,791
Be in the damn club
trying to hang out and shit.

307
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,059
You know what I mean, meeting girls.

308
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:22,327
"What's up, baby?
Come here.

309
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:24,495
"Let me holler at you right quick.

310
00:14:24,563 --> 00:14:27,665
"Come here, let me talk to you right quick.

311
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,868
"Get your ass over here.

312
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:30,968
"I'll hook the hook on your arm.

313
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,737
"Get your ass over here.

314
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,439
"I'm talking to you.

315
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:35,640
Don't... Don't... Don't do that."

316
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,975
[Laughs]

317
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,710
This ain't good for nothing.

318
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,311
Know what it's good for?
Putting in ingredients.

319
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:44,148
Put a little oregano in there,

320
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,217
A dash of pepper,

321
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:48,853
And you drizzle some teriyaki, drizzle.

322
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:52,891
It's a drizzler too.

323
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,225
Then you stir it up with the same hand,

324
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,994
You stir it up.

325
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,762
[Laughs]

326
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:00,231
You serve it with
the same hand too, see that?

327
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:01,866
You want some kool-Aid?
You want some fruit punch?

328
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,267
Fruit punch, I got fruit punch over here.

329
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:04,903
Got fruit punch.

330
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,804
You say it ain't sweet,
it ain't sweet, it ain't sweet?

331
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,072
That goddamn sugar at the bottom, huh?

332
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,242
Sugar at the bottom.

333
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:18,683
Try to be cool with this.

334
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:23,087
[Cheers and applause]

335
00:15:26,558 --> 00:15:27,725
And your ass can't even get a job,

336
00:15:27,793 --> 00:15:29,460
Because your arm all jacked up, right?

337
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,895
You going to interviews everywhere.

338
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,563
Hey, I want...
Can I get a job?

339
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:33,798
All the doors slam in your face

340
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,201
'Cause your damn arm all [bleep]ed up.

341
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,537
Or you gotta get a job
doing children's parties,

342
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,738
You know what I mean?

343
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:43,608
Doing shadow puppet shows and shit.

344
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:44,809
Your ass doing shit...

345
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,713
All right, kids.

346
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:56,721
Oh, my god.

347
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,325
Did I tell you kids
what happened to my arm?

348
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:05,730
The police messed up
mr. Johnson's ligament, kids.

349
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:10,068
So I got a swan, I got a rabbit,

350
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:12,670
And a pair of scissors.

351
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:15,073
So the swan and the rabbit went to staples

352
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,511
To steal a pair of scissors.

353
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:22,380
And the rabbit was like, "come on, man.

354
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,983
"We don't got to steal no damn scissors.

355
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,651
"It ain't like we ain't got
no damn money, man.

356
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:27,819
"We got money.

357
00:16:27,886 --> 00:16:29,520
We can buy our own pair
of scissors."

358
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:34,659
And the swan was like, "[bleep] that shit!

359
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,662
"I'm not paying for no damn scissors.

360
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,664
I'ma keep it real
up in here!"

361
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,933
"Come on, man, not today, man.

362
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,134
"This ain't even cool, man.

363
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,736
You got money
in your pocket."

364
00:16:44,803 --> 00:16:47,739
"I got money!
My money in my pocket!

365
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:51,442
"Like I said, you can be
a bitch if you want to,

366
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,445
"But I'm not paying for no
mother[bleep]ing scissors."

367
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,795
[Laughs] this is...

368
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,563
This is the swan getting arrested.

369
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,533
Ah, ah, ah!

370
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,572
Took his ass to jail.

371
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,975
They put his ass in [bleep]ing jail.

372
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,878
That's how he look in jail.

373
00:17:29,415 --> 00:17:31,816
"Let me out of here!

374
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,418
"Yo, what you doing?
Stop, stop.

375
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:36,320
Stop, stop!"

376
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:48,800
I'm talking about politics.

377
00:17:48,868 --> 00:17:50,268
Everybody wants you
to vote for them, right?

378
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,335
"Vote for me,
vote for me."

379
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,404
They're sitting up there, right?

380
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,039
They're trying to be honest
with you and everything.

381
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,273
You don't know what's going on, right?

382
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,041
Honest things are coming out your mouth,

383
00:17:57,109 --> 00:18:02,780
But meanwhile, you got a dishonest ass.

384
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,417
The crack of your ass
is dishonest to america.

385
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:07,785
Have you washed your ass today?

386
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,120
I'm not gonna vote for you, no!

387
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,689
Turn around.
Let me see your face!

388
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,792
Don't talk through your ass.

389
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,694
That's how I dooz it.

390
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:26,504
Other guys ask me
after the shows about ligaments.

391
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,040
I'm a goddamn ligament expert,
you understand?

392
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,346
Your whole body is full...

393
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,415
When I tell your body...
Fellas, let me tell you about

394
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,350
Fellas and ligaments.

395
00:18:39,418 --> 00:18:42,987
Your whole body is loaded
with ligaments, fellas.

396
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,922
Right?

397
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:47,558
You got a ligament that separates

398
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:50,495
Your balls and your ass[bleep].

399
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,897
You know what I'm saying?

400
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,732
There's a ligament that runs
right here, right here,

401
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,735
Between here.

402
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,836
Put your hand down there, feel right now.

403
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:00,238
Put your hand down there, fellas.

404
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:03,207
Put your hand... Put your hand
down there, feel it.

405
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,876
It separates
your balls and your ass[bleep].

406
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:06,611
It's a little piece of ligament,
look at me, right there.

407
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,880
It's a little piece of ligament
that separates these two.

408
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,716
Right? That's how
your body's designed.

409
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,084
You've got to have a little space there.

410
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,519
You can't just go balls and ass[bleep].

411
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,721
You can't just go straight
to balls and ass[bleep],

412
00:19:16,788 --> 00:19:18,356
Right?
Your balls...

413
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,224
Your balls cannot
be too close to your ass[bleep].

414
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,325
You'll [bleep] around
and [bleep] your nuts out,

415
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,361
You know what I mean?

416
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:25,129
This is called the spring ligament.

417
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:28,266
The spring ligament, the spring ligament.

418
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,202
This ligament right here is
the spring ligament, understand?

419
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,470
Right?

420
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,437
When you use this ligament right here,

421
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,539
This is called...

422
00:19:34,606 --> 00:19:36,340
This ligament gives you the lift.

423
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:40,645
It picks your johnson up.

424
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:42,180
Somebody gotta pick your johnson up.

425
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:45,850
Think that blood's that damn
strong to pick your johnson up?

426
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:47,685
The blood gets it hard.

427
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,822
But the spring ligament
lifts it up, you understand?

428
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,758
All the guys don't even know
it's down there.

429
00:19:53,825 --> 00:19:55,660
You never know it's down there
till you get tender one day,

430
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:57,562
Like, ow, what I do last...
Ooh, ooh.

431
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,130
You having rough-Ass sex
and you realize

432
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,331
Something ain't right right there.

433
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:01,532
Anybody ever get that feeling?
Any guys?

434
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,567
Like, "ooh, what I do right there?

435
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,403
What I do?
What I do?"

436
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:06,904
You doing some acrobatic stuff,
you're all...

437
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,773
You're trying something funky,
something crazy.

438
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,474
You trying to do something crazy,

439
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,343
And you pull that little piece
of ligament right there,

440
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:13,644
You pull it.

441
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,279
She done messed your damn ligament up.

442
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:17,448
You in the bathroom like,
"ow, ow, what the hell she do?

443
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,518
"Ow, it's tender, it's tender.

444
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,453
"It's tender.

445
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:24,355
Ow, it's tender."

446
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,994
You walk in that bedroom.
Your lady's on the bed.

447
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,929
She's like, "mm,
where you been at? Come on."

448
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:36,334
You're like, "oh, shit."

449
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:38,603
'Cause now you ain't got no damn lift.

450
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:41,072
The blood came to work,

451
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,207
Your johnson hard as a rock.

452
00:20:43,275 --> 00:20:45,276
But it's aimed
to the damn ground like that.

453
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:47,812
Like that.

454
00:20:47,879 --> 00:20:49,313
You're like, "oh, man,
what am I going to do?"

455
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,314
She's like, "come on, baby,

456
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,183
What you doing?
Come on."

457
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,986
Oh, shit.

458
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,255
Now you gotta think, think,
think, think, think.

459
00:20:57,322 --> 00:20:58,589
You've got to make love
to your lady somehow.

460
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,757
What the [bleep] am I going to do?

461
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,459
What the [bleep] am I going to do?

462
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:02,693
How you gonna...

463
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:07,265
You gotta turn your lady upside down.

464
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:09,200
You gotta pogo-Stick that ass.

465
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,481
Take care of your damn lady.

466
00:21:23,548 --> 00:21:24,582
Right?
Take care of your damn lady.

467
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,883
This your lady right here, playboy?

468
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:30,187
Take care of your damn lady, man.

469
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:31,289
Take care of your lady.

470
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:35,359
He gonna touch her too.
Mm-Hmm.

471
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:36,994
[Laughs]

472
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,329
Aww, look at him.

473
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:39,397
[Audience awws]

474
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:40,798
They're so cute.

475
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,334
You buy nice things,
perfume, that kind of stuff?

476
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:46,203
Don't you ever buy no perfume!

477
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,547
A man can't buy a lady perfume, playboy.

478
00:21:56,615 --> 00:21:58,849
You know why?
Let me tell you why.

479
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,719
It takes women a thousand years

480
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,222
To find the right fragrance
that smells good on them.

481
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,658
Perfume ain't shit.
You understand?

482
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:10,795
Perfume is not what makes
your lady smell good.

483
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:13,331
Your lady makes your lady smell good.

484
00:22:13,398 --> 00:22:14,765
Every lady has their own natural chemistry.

485
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,233
You don't believe me?

486
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,103
Next time you're walking down
in times square, right,

487
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,938
Next time you in times square,
every lady you walk by,

488
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,841
Just lick their face.

489
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:34,318
You're going to go to jail, but...

490
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:37,088
You will find out that every
lady tastes a little different.

491
00:22:37,155 --> 00:22:39,523
You understand?

492
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:41,158
All you can do is
go in that damn cabinet...

493
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:42,493
That's all you can do is go in the cabinet,

494
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:43,961
See what's almost empty,

495
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,463
Take it, look at it,

496
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:49,367
And go and buy more of the stuff
that she used up already.

497
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:51,102
Know what I'm saying?

498
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:52,403
You come back,
you give her that damn perfume

499
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:53,871
That she's almost empty on,

500
00:22:53,939 --> 00:22:56,707
I'm telling you,
you're gonna get a piece of ass.

501
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:57,775
She's gonna be like, "oh, my god,

502
00:22:57,843 --> 00:22:59,410
"You are paying attention to me.

503
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,245
"You went in the cabinet
and found what was empty.

504
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,646
"Oh, my god, I love you.

505
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:08,152
I freaking love you,
you know that?"

506
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,687
But, see, now you can't
do it with this lady,

507
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:11,188
'Cause she just heard me.

508
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:14,125
Your next girlfriend...

509
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:19,930
All I buy my wife...
Let me tell you.

510
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:21,365
All I buy...
I'm smart.

511
00:23:21,433 --> 00:23:23,367
All I buy is things I know she loves.

512
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:24,635
You know what I mean?

513
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,304
All I buy is, like, high heel stilettos.

514
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:28,873
That's the sexiest shit
in t [bleep]ing world.

515
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,875
Right?

516
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,710
When a lady knows how to work
them damn high heeled shoes,

517
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,345
This shit right here.

518
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:35,613
This is how my wife walks around the house.

519
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,680
I caught her slinking
around the damn house,

520
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,015
She was slinking like this.

521
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:38,849
That's called slinking around
the damn ho...

522
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:40,251
Look at this shit.

523
