00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,416
[pensive music playing]

2
00:01:04,875 --> 00:01:06,416
[boy] <i>When my father passed,</i>

3
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,875
<i>I wanted nothing more
than my mother's happiness.</i>

4
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,083
<i>For what kind of man would I be
if I did not help my mother?</i>

5
00:01:21,416 --> 00:01:22,625
<i>If I did not save her?</i>

6
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,583
[mooing]

7
00:01:32,083 --> 00:01:33,916
[cowhand shouting indistinctly]

00:02:12,125 --> 00:02:13,666
[door closes]

10
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,833
You're not eating?

11
00:02:14,916 --> 00:02:15,750
No.

12
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,625
[housekeeper sighs]

13
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:27,791
[sighs]

14
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,333
Have you figured it out yet, fatso?

15
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:38,333
- [man] What?
- [plucking banjo]

16
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,416
How many years
since we took over the ranch

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,625
from the Old Gent and Old Lady?

18
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:45,333
Why?

19
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:47,958
Oh hell, think about it.

20
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,958
[playing melody on banjo]

21
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:55,875
You ever try the house bath, Phil?

22
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,041
No, I have not.

23
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,500
[sighs]

24
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,041
[Phil] Early up tomorrow, brother.
Big old drive.

25
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,000
[cow mooing in distance]

26
00:03:12,083 --> 00:03:14,250
[pensive music playing]

27
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:16,500
- [cows mooing]
- [cowhand whistles]

28
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:21,583
[indistinct chatter]

29
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,166
[Phil] There's a dead cow.
Keep our cattle away.

30
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,583
- [cowhand] What happened?
- [Phil] Anthrax. Don't touch.

31
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,083
Well, guess this is it.

32
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:56,458
What's "it," Phil?

33
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:02,250
What's "it"? All right, fatso,
I'll tell you what "it" is.

34
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,250
Twenty-five years
since our first run together.

35
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:09,625
Nineteen hundred and nothing.

36
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:11,916
That's a long time.

37
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,208
Well, not too damn long.

38
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,750
Know what we should do?

39
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,666
What's that?

40
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,125
Go camping again in the mountains
and shoot ourselves some fresh elk liver.

41
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:34,583
Cook it right there on the coals
like Bronco Henry taught us.

42
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,583
You got a sore gut?

43
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:42,791
No.

44
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:45,958
You act like it pains you
to hitch two words together.

45
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,541
[cowhands shout indistinctly]

46
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:01,541

[doorbell jingles]

49
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:42,583
There'll be 12 for tonight.

50
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:46,333
Do you what they'd prefer to eat?

51
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:48,166
They like the fried chicken dinner.

52
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:56,833
[humming]

53
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,291
[boy] Yes?

54
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,791
I'm going to need your room.

55
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:01,875
[boy] All right.

56
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,541
[door opens]

57
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,083
What are you doing?

58
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:10,791
Nothing.

59
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:15,833
Is that an album?

60
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:18,666
Not really.

61
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,583
- [woman] May I?
- Sure.

62
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:21,916
[woman gasps]

63
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,958
- [boy] Do you like the mansion?
- [woman] Too much to clean.

64
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:31,041
You wouldn't have to clean it.
There would be cleaners.

65
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:31,958
[both chuckle]

66
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:35,583
Oh, she's beautiful.

67
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:38,583
I like her flowers.

68
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,208
Oh! That's clever, Peter.

69
00:06:45,833 --> 00:06:47,583
They're so lovely.

70
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:48,708
Thanks.

71
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,875
[woman] For the tables?

72
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:53,958
Sure.

73
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,541
- I need three chickens. Can you do them?
- All right.

74
00:07:00,958 --> 00:07:03,916
[sighs] You're gonna have
to move your stuff to the shed.

75
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I'll make a bed for you on the floor.

76
00:07:06,083 --> 00:07:08,083
[uneasy music playing]

77
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,708
- [cows mooing]
- [cowhands whistling]

78
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:42,291
[cowhands shouting indistinctly]

79
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,833
[pensive music playing]

80
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,208
[cowhands shouting indistinctly]

81
00:08:10,583 --> 00:08:11,625
[dog barks]

82
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,708
[indistinct chatter]

83
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,583
Jake.

84
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,416
[men chattering indistinctly]

85
00:08:42,375 --> 00:08:44,208
- [Phil] He there?
- Nope.

86
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,375
Well, we can't wait forever.
The cattle are in the yards, so drink up.

87
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,083
- You gonna say something?
- Nope.

88
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:56,708
Not without my brother.

89
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:02,666
[breathes deeply]

90
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:06,875
Where were you?

91
00:09:07,458 --> 00:09:09,625
I couldn't make
the boys hold back forever.

92
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,000
That's fine.

93
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,791
Uh…

94
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:16,875
Checked the power, and it's held up.
Not coming till morning.

95
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,333
Oh, no, thanks. Phil, they're ready for us
next door at the Red Mill.

96
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,625
Dinnertime, boys.

97
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:24,791
[indistinct chatter]

98
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,250
[man] Let's get a move on.

99
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:33,708
Twenty-five years ago,
where were you, Georgie Boy?

100
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:34,958
Hmm?

101
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,458
- With you.
- I'll tell you.

102
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,791
A chubby know-nothing
too dumb to get through college.

103
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,291
People helped you, fatso.

104
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,291
One person in particular
taught you and me ranching

105
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,125
so we damn well succeeded.

106
00:09:55,291 --> 00:09:57,000
- Bronco Henry.
- Hmm.

107
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,125
[clears throat] So…

108
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:07,625
So, to us brothers, Romulus and Remus,
and the wolf who raised us.

109
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,458
- [cowhand 1] Bronco Henry.
- [cowhands] Bronco.

110
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:10,875
<i>- Il Lupo.</i>
- [George] Bronco.

111
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:13,333
- [cowhand 2] Bronco Henry.
- [cowhand 3] Bronco Henry.

112
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,458
[glasses thudding on table]

113
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:17,583
[whistles]

114
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,083
- [cowhand 4] Boss is leavin'.
- [cowhand 5] Dinner, boys.

115
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,333
[George] Much obliged.

116
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:32,416
[indistinct chatter]

117
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:39,458
Rose? Rose, play piano for us please.

118
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:40,708
[Rose] I can't!

119
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,416
- [diners] Play! Play! Play!
- [woman 1] Come on!

120
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,500
[diners banging on table]

121
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,041
[diners groaning]

122
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,458
- Is everything all right?
- [George] Yes, ma'am. Fine.

123
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,583
[man] I can play the piano.

124
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:55,666
[diners laughing]

125
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,875
[indistinct chatter]

126
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,041
Well, well…

127
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,791
Ain't them purdy.

128
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,875
[cowhands chuckle]

129
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:21,958
[diners laughing]

130
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,833
[woman 2] "I've never seen a woman
behind the wheel of a car."

131
00:11:26,916 --> 00:11:29,166
[indistinct chatter]

132
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,958
[diners laughing]

133
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:40,291
[woman 2] I said, "Have you never seen
a lady drive a car before?"

134
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,375
[indistinct chatter]

135
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,000
He thought the dog was driving.

136
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,500
No. No.

137
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,083
- No!
- [laughing]

138
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,500
Oh, yeah.

139
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,208
Well…

140
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:54,333
I wonder what little lady made these.

141
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,875
[cowhands chuckle]

142
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,875
Actually, I did, sir.

143
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,500
My mother was a florist.

144
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:06,833
So I made them
to look like the ones in our garden.

145
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,916
Oh, well, do pardon me.

146
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:16,041
They're just as real as possible.

147
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,791
[cowhands chuckle]

148
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,083
[sniffing] Mmm.

149
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,125
[sniffing]

150
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:26,833
All right. Now, gentlemen, look.
See, that's what you do with the cloth.

151
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,375
[cowhands gasping]

152
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,500
- It's really just for wine drips.
- [Phil] Ooh, you got that, boys?

153
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,666
Only for the drips. [lisps]

154
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,375
[all laughing]

155
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,041
Now get us some food.

156
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:14,416
- Did Bronco ever eat here?
- No, he did not.

157
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,333
So where did you eat?

158
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:21,750
Uh, back then we had herring at the saloon
and a whole lot of alcohol.

159
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:22,708
[scoffs]

160
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,083
Oh.

161
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:28,125
I remember this one time, Bronco made
this wager that he could jump any horse

162
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:32,000
over the tables and chairs of the saloon
piled up in the street.

163
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:36,416
Well, we chose him a nag all right.

164
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,250
[all chuckle]

165
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,500
It didn't bother him.

166
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,291
He took off his saddle,

167
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:45,916
walked the horse
up to the tables and chairs,

168
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,500
talking to him all the while,

169
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,791
stroking his big, ugly head
while the horse sniffed.

170
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:52,791
[Phil clicks tongue]

171
00:13:53,541 --> 00:14:00,083
And then he swung on
and rode him back and… [exhales]

172
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:03,833
[cowhand 1] What?

173
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:08,625
Flew over.

174
00:14:08,708 --> 00:14:10,333
- [all chuckling]
- [cowhand 2] He jumped it?

175
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,125
- [cowhand 2 groans]
- [all laughing]

176
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,541
But to get a nag to jump… ain't heard of.

177
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,458
Put it down to <i>amour.</i> [sighs]

178
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,083
What do you say, George?

179
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,750
<i>Amour?</i>

180

00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:08,000
We were married Sunday.

362
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:12,375
She got rid of her property in Beech.

363
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:23,291
[uneasy music playing]

364
00:32:36,666 --> 00:32:37,583
Quit it.

365
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:39,083
[horse grunts]

366
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,000
Stand steady, you little bitch, huh?

367
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,125
- Come on.
- [horse snorts]

368
00:32:43,875 --> 00:32:47,666
Look at me, you little bitch!
Huh? [grunts] Yeah?

369
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,541
Quit it! You fat-faced bitch!

370
00:32:54,125 --> 00:32:55,125
Whore!

371
00:32:55,208 --> 00:32:56,625
[horse whinnying]

372
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:05,375
[woman] My school boarders eat dinner
at 6:00 p.m. sharp.

373
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:07,958
No dish-washing duty if he has homework.

374
00:33:08,833 --> 00:33:11,291
Oh. No shoes inside.

375
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:19,041
[Rose] Maybe you'd like to come
to the ranch sometimes?

376
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,375
Won't that be nice?

377
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,208
[Peter] May I keep
some of these rose petals?

378
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,416
[George] Hey, ho.

379
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,750
Take the rest for later.

380
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:45,416
[sniffing]

381
00:33:56,750 --> 00:34:00,708
[George] I've been thinking
we should have some sort of dinner party

382
00:34:00,791 --> 00:34:02,541
to introduce you to my parents.

383
00:34:05,041 --> 00:34:09,416
And perhaps we could invite
the governor and his wife too.

384
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,291
I saw them in Herndon today, and, uh,

385
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,041
I… I kind of already mentioned it to them.

386
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:18,375
[chuckles]

387
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:24,416
Uh, maybe you'd be kind enough
to play something on our old piano.

388
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,291
But, George, I'm not very good.

389
00:34:29,125 --> 00:34:31,958
- I only played for the moving pictures.
- [chuckles]

390
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:36,041
You are plenty fine enough for us.

391
00:34:38,333 --> 00:34:41,333
The Old Lady can't play a note,
so… [chuckles]

392
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:43,625
If that's what you want.

393
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:49,541
This looks like a good spot.

394
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,625
Pull over here, please.

395
00:34:51,708 --> 00:34:53,291
[George] A good spot for what?

396
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,458
[Rose chuckles softly]

397
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,875
You are marvelous, Rose.

398
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:22,500
[chuckles softly]

399
00:35:30,125 --> 00:35:31,541
Stand beside me, George.

400
00:35:36,166 --> 00:35:37,833
[George] What's happening? [chuckles]

401
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:39,083
[Rose] Follow me.

402
00:35:40,166 --> 00:35:41,166
Left foot forward.

403
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:45,833
One, two, three. And to the side.

404
00:35:45,916 --> 00:35:49,083
One, two, three. And back.

405
00:35:49,166 --> 00:35:52,541
One, two, three.

406
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:56,833
- To the side again. One, two…
- Sorry, I… I really can't.

407
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:02,208
- I really can't dance. I… [chuckles]
- You're dancing. [chuckles]

408
00:36:03,416 --> 00:36:05,166
Here. This foot forward.

409
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:08,625
Don't think.

410
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,750
One, two, three. To the side.

411
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:15,166
One, two, three. And back.

412
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,500
One, two, three.

413
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,416
I told you I'd teach you. [chuckles]

414
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,458
Forward, two, three.

415
00:36:30,541 --> 00:36:31,875
Side, two…

416
00:36:31,958 --> 00:36:33,958
[humming]

417
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,208
[breathes deeply]

418
00:36:48,125 --> 00:36:49,291
What is it, George?

419
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,375
I just… [sighs]

420
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,375
I wanted to say how nice it is

421
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:05,416
not to be alone.

422
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
[somber music playing]

423
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,208
[thunder rumbling]

424
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,500
[engine idling]

425
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:54,208
[George] Go on up and get out of the cold.

426
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,208
[car door closes]

427
00:38:04,083 --> 00:38:06,083
[thunder rumbling]

428
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:11,375
[door closes]

429
00:38:14,708 --> 00:38:15,791
Hello, Phil.

430
00:38:16,958 --> 00:38:18,416
You remember Rose?

431
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:21,416
- Oh, hello there.
- Hello.

432
00:38:22,708 --> 00:38:25,583
- Something wrong with the furnace?
- Search me.

433
00:38:28,666 --> 00:38:31,875
- I'll go down and shake it up.
- I've been hanging around for you all day.

434
00:38:31,958 --> 00:38:34,541
There's a deed
the Old Gent wants sent to him.

435
00:38:36,541 --> 00:38:38,583
Well, I figure that can go till morning.

436
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:41,958
- You all right?
- I'm perfectly fine, George.

437
00:38:45,458 --> 00:38:46,833
[sighs]

438
00:38:50,583 --> 00:38:51,958
[muttering softly]

439
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,375
Well, brother Phil,

440
00:39:03,291 --> 00:39:04,791
we had such a nice trip...

441
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,083
I'm not your brother.

442
00:39:06,833 --> 00:39:08,375
You're a cheap schemer.

443
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:12,166
[housekeeper humming]

444
00:39:20,166 --> 00:39:22,166

445
00:39:27,958 --> 00:39:29,916
[mockingly] "We had such a nice trip."

[footsteps receding]

450
00:40:02,916 --> 00:40:04,125
[whispers] Come on in.

451
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:12,000
This is the bathroom.
Just make yourself at home.

452
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:19,125
Yeah, that's fine.

453
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:20,833
All right.

454
00:40:22,625 --> 00:40:23,458

[uneasy music playing]

468
00:43:52,291 --> 00:43:54,791
Now, you just make yourself comfortable.

469
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,166
Now, I'm going to bring you a surprise.

470
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:01,916
What is it?

471
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:05,208
Well, then it won't be a surprise.

472
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:06,416
[kisses]

473
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:27,708
[housekeeper] When the rains come,
the cellar gets flooded.

474
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:32,916
So, the rats all drown.
They float to the surface.

475
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:37,041
I have to get the young lads in
to scoop 'em all up with a…

476
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,333
Please keep talking. [chuckles]

477
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:51,375
Don't mind me.

478
00:44:52,541 --> 00:44:53,625
I like to keep busy.

479
00:45:00,125 --> 00:45:02,125
[dogs barking]

480

[cowhands panting]

481
00:45:08,666 --> 00:45:09,666
[George] Easy.

482
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,333
[cowhand 1] We got it.

483
00:45:12,416 --> 00:45:13,791
[George] Head to the right.

484
00:45:14,291 --> 00:45:16,291
[indistinct chatter]

485
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,458
- [George] Turn it around that way.
- [young housekeeper] Please, I'll take it.

486
00:45:22,416 --> 00:45:24,708
- What is it?
- [George] Head to the front door.

487
00:45:25,208 --> 00:45:27,125
[Rose panting] George. Is that…

488
00:45:28,083 --> 00:45:29,583
Is that a grand?

489
00:45:29,666 --> 00:45:31,583
- [George] You got it?
- [cowhand 2] Yeah, I got it.

490
00:45:31,666 --> 00:45:36,083
- [cowhand 3 grunting] Whoa, hold it.
- It's a Mason & Hamlin baby grand.

491
00:45:36,625 --> 00:45:39,000
Oh no, it's… it's too good for me. I'm…

492
00:45:39,583 --> 00:45:42,541
I'm just very average.
I… I only know tunes.

493
00:45:43,375 --> 00:45:44,958
That's what I want, tunes.

494
00:45:45,583 --> 00:45:46,875
The governor too.

495
00:45:47,708 --> 00:45:50,791
We don't want a concert.
We just wanna hear you play, Rose.

496
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,875
- I should like to look on the governor…
- [George] Easy.

497
00:45:54,958 --> 00:45:58,416

[cowhands grunting]

499
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:02,958

[sighs]

518
00:49:28,875 --> 00:49:32,958
- [cowhand] You make a rope with these?
- [Phil] These strips? Yeah.

519
00:49:48,541 --> 00:49:50,416
You boys find something needs doing.

520
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:53,416
[cowhands] Yes, sir.

00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,125
[cowhands speaking indistinctly]

522
00:50:04,458 --> 00:50:07,500
I just came over to speak about something.

523
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,625
Come on, partner.
Open your talker. What is it?

524
00:50:22,291 --> 00:50:23,375
[hesitates]

525
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:30,750
His Nibs will be here for dinner
and the Old Gent and the Old Lady.

526
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:34,666
Well, sir, ain't we going into society.

527
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,041
[both chuckle]

528
00:50:39,791 --> 00:50:41,500
[Phil] She on the pinano again?

529
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,750
Setting your teeth on edge?

530
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,458
No. Uh…

531
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:52,625
No, I… I like to hear Rose play.

532
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:55,833
Hmm.

533
00:51:01,083 --> 00:51:02,541
Well, old-timer, what is it?

534
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:03,708
What's in the noodle?

535
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:07,375
[George] Well…

536
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:11,625
Phil. [hesitates] I, uh…

537
00:51:14,916 --> 00:51:17,291
- I just…
- Go on, spit it out.

538
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:21,375
- Well, it's about His Nibs, the governor.
- [Phil] All right.

539
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:22,958
And, uh…

540
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,000
Well, it's not so much about His Nibs

541
00:51:28,291 --> 00:51:32,458
but His Nibs' wife, actually, uh…

542
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:39,041
I was thinking His Nibs
probably wouldn't mind so much,

543
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:43,333
but his missus might.

544
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:45,416
What, for dear Christ's sake?

545
00:51:46,666 --> 00:51:49,875
Well, it's sort of a hard thing…
[exhales sharply]

546
00:51:51,583 --> 00:51:52,583
…to say.

547
00:51:52,666 --> 00:51:53,750
Uh…

548
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:01,041
She might mind if you come
to the table without a washup.

549
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Yeah.

550
00:52:09,166 --> 00:52:11,166
[pensive music playing]

551
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,208
[George] Hello, Mother, Father.

552
00:52:31,291 --> 00:52:32,250
[Old Gent] Hello.

553
00:52:35,750 --> 00:52:37,583
The car's around the side.

554
00:52:37,666 --> 00:52:38,916
Is there anyone with you?

555
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:41,250
My wife.

556
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:54,041
The napkin is fanned, so…

557
00:52:54,833 --> 00:52:56,041
[whistles]

558
00:52:57,333 --> 00:52:58,875
Light the fire.

559
00:52:58,958 --> 00:53:00,333
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

560
00:53:00,416 --> 00:53:02,375
We may as well try and warm this place.

561
00:53:04,125 --> 00:53:05,916
Water, white wine…

562
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:11,291
Use your hand. Use your hand like so.

563
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:13,875
[young housekeeper] They're here.

564
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,208
You keep warm. I can bring them in.

565
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:45,541
[indistinct chatter, cheering]

566
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:56,000
[woman chuckling] Oh, how sweet.
They have their own umbrella.

567
00:53:56,083 --> 00:53:59,416
- [George] Orange blossoms.
- It's an island of civilization here.

568
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,333
[woman] Mmm.

569
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:03,875
I was, uh, telling Georgie
about your brother.

570
00:54:03,958 --> 00:54:06,125
Phi Beta Kappa at Yale, wasn't it?

571
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:08,541
Yes, in classics.

572
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,458
That's right.

573
00:54:11,208 --> 00:54:15,458
So, uh… he swears at the cattle
in Greek or Latin?

574
00:54:15,541 --> 00:54:17,958
[woman and George chuckle]

575
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:23,333
Yeah.

576
00:54:25,375 --> 00:54:30,125
Uh, Rose plays the piano very well.

577
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:31,708
Do you?

578
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,916
That's a nice surprise.

579
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:38,708
[chuckles]

580
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,708
I'll just go have a look-see
out the back for Phil.

581
00:54:47,375 --> 00:54:49,291
Oh, good. I want to meet this brother.

582
00:54:50,291 --> 00:54:51,291
[George] Yes.

583
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:55,250
[woman] I suppose
there was some sort of an injury.

584
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,041
[Old Lady laughing] Oh, Edward, Georgina.

585
00:54:57,125 --> 00:54:59,833
Ah! Here are two people we can't fool.

586
00:54:59,916 --> 00:55:03,583
Oh no, you cannot. We know everything.
We're walking encyclopedias.

587
00:55:03,666 --> 00:55:05,875
At least I am.
I have nothing to do but read.

588
00:55:05,958 --> 00:55:08,958
[Old Gent] She's been reading
"The Curse of Tutankhamun" in <i>The Digest.</i>

589
00:55:09,041 --> 00:55:11,291
So, uh, you believe in the curse?

590
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:14,416
Oh, no, no, I'm not drinking
George's concoction.

591
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,333
Yes, I do. But did you know
that Tutankhamun was just a boy?

592
00:55:18,416 --> 00:55:19,291
Only 18.

593
00:55:31,541 --> 00:55:32,958
[George] Phil, are you here?

594
00:55:42,583 --> 00:55:43,750
I was looking for you.

595
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,458
Well, you found me.

596
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,958
Everyone's here.
And we're just about to eat.

597
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:56,125
They're asking after you.

598
00:55:58,041 --> 00:55:59,000
Really?

599
00:55:59,916 --> 00:56:02,708
Yes, we're counting on your conversation.

600
00:56:08,625 --> 00:56:11,750
I shouldn't have said
what I said to you about...

601
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:15,166
You two can keep your apologies
to yourself. I'm not coming.

602
00:56:17,166 --> 00:56:18,750
And what will I say?

603
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,458
The Old Lady wants to see you too.
She's come a long way.

604
00:56:23,541 --> 00:56:24,958
You can tell them the truth.

605
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:29,083
That I stink and I like it.

606
00:56:31,833 --> 00:56:34,000
[Old Lady] Nothing could have happened
to Phil, could it?

607
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:37,958
[George] No, he'll be fine.
Something just must've come up.

608
00:56:40,625 --> 00:56:41,791
[Georgina] So, Rose…

609
00:56:44,166 --> 00:56:45,625
Are you going to play for us?

610
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:48,208
[Old Lady] Yes, George told me
you play very well.

611
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:51,083
- Oh no, I'm terribly out of practice.
- [Edward] Yes, we'd love that.

612
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:54,500
Come now, you've been playing a lot.

613
00:56:54,583 --> 00:56:55,666
You know you have.

614
00:56:56,750 --> 00:56:58,458
I don't know what to play.

615
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:00,333
[George] Why,

616
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,583
play the one I like.

617
00:57:03,625 --> 00:57:07,583
- What one?
- Why, the… the one about the Gypsy.

618
00:57:07,666 --> 00:57:09,708
I… I can't seem to remember that one.

619
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:16,416
Just play anything. [chuckles]

620
00:57:18,250 --> 00:57:19,458
[sighs]

621
00:57:49,250 --> 00:57:50,083
[clears throat]

622
00:58:02,291 --> 00:58:03,458
[Rose sighs]

623
00:58:04,041 --> 00:58:05,583
[playing discordantly]

624
00:58:07,583 --> 00:58:08,833
I'm so sorry.

625
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:12,166
I can't seem to play. [chuckles]

626
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:17,083
I… I played in a cinema pit
for hours and hours.

627
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:19,750
I'm… I'm so sorry.

628
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:24,291
Well, she got you halter trained,
right, George? That's the main thing.

629
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:26,000
- [laughing]
- [Rose] I'm so sorry.

630
00:58:26,083 --> 00:58:28,666
No, it was a lovely, lovely evening.

631
00:58:28,750 --> 00:58:29,583
Thank you.

632
00:58:30,083 --> 00:58:32,083
[Phil whistling melodically]

633
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:41,791
Oh, you're Phil.

634
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,791
So, you weren't eaten by a cougar.

635
00:58:46,125 --> 00:58:47,041
[Phil] Not yet.

636
00:58:47,541 --> 00:58:49,708
I am sorry
to have missed your conversation.

637
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:51,208
I've heard you're brilliant.

638
00:58:51,291 --> 00:58:54,458
You're gonna want to keep your distance.
I'm just off the horse.

639
00:58:55,625 --> 00:58:57,208
Anyhows, you don't want conversation.

640
00:58:57,291 --> 00:59:00,166
You've been listening to the pinano
and dancing, I guess.

641
00:59:03,208 --> 00:59:04,291
You dance?

642
00:59:10,083 --> 00:59:11,958
You didn't play?

643
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,375
You sure did practice a terrible lot.

644
00:59:17,750 --> 00:59:19,875
See, you wouldn't think
there was much difference

645
00:59:19,958 --> 00:59:22,333
between a cinema pit and a dinner party.

646
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,916
[Old Lady] Where have you been, Phil?

647
00:59:25,375 --> 00:59:27,291
I could hardly eat worrying about you.

648
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:31,041
I didn't get washed up, so I didn't come.

649
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,666
[Old Lady chuckles] You didn't wash?

650
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:39,333
Oh, he's a ranchman, isn't that right?
That's honest dirt.

651
00:59:42,375 --> 00:59:43,833
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.

652
00:59:43,916 --> 00:59:45,666
[indistinct chatter]

653
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,875
[George] I'll just run and grab you
a blanket for the ride.

654
00:59:57,958 --> 00:59:59,833
[whistling melodically]

655
01:00:11,833 --> 01:00:13,625
[continues whistling]

656
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,875
[George] All right, goodbye.

657
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:20,166
[uneasy music playing]

658
01:00:53,333 --> 01:00:55,166
[Rose] I wondered
if you didn't think about

659
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:57,583
leaving your medical books here
for the summer.

660
01:00:58,708 --> 01:01:03,125
I thought about it, but…
but you understand they were Dad's.

661
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:04,875
Turn around.

662
01:01:07,916 --> 01:01:08,958
Are you eating?

663
01:01:12,333 --> 01:01:13,333
I made a new friend.

664
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:16,041
He calls me Doctor,
and I call him Professor,

665
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:17,916
'cause that's what we wanna be.

666
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,458
Why don't you invite your friend
to the ranch?

667
01:01:21,541 --> 01:01:22,708
[scoffs] No, Rose.

668
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:24,875
Why not?

669
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:27,375
Thank you.

670
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:29,583
I don't want him to meet a certain person.

671
01:01:30,625 --> 01:01:32,625
[dramatic music playing]

672
01:01:34,333 --> 01:01:35,708
[cowhand 1] A bull calf, boss!

673
01:01:35,791 --> 01:01:38,416
[cowhand 2] Keep that leg stretched out!
You got him?

674
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,583
[cowhand 3] Grab his head!

675
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:43,541
[cowhand 4] I got it! I got it!

676
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,916
[cows bleating]

677
01:01:53,666 --> 01:01:55,500
[cowhand 5] How come
you don't wear gloves?

678
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,791
[Phil] How 'bout
'cause they're not needed.

679
01:02:04,333 --> 01:02:07,208
Castrate 1,500 head,
then nick your thumb on the last.

680
01:02:09,041 --> 01:02:10,083
[sighs]

681
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:13,625
Well, fatso, I think we're finished.

682
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:23,166
Who's that?

683
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:27,083
Miss Nancy.

684
01:02:28,208 --> 01:02:29,458
Our waiter?

685
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,333
Yep, that's him.

686
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:36,000
You're gonna see him
creeping all over the place now.

687
01:02:36,083 --> 01:02:37,875
Big eyes goggling.

688
01:02:42,708 --> 01:02:44,875
Little Lord Fauntleroy.

689
01:02:45,375 --> 01:02:47,208
[Rose speaking indistinctly]

690
01:02:56,708 --> 01:02:57,708
[sighs]

691
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:03,041
[George] Rose?

692
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:03,958
[sighs]

693
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:06,541
[George] Does he like his room?

694
01:03:07,041 --> 01:03:07,958
[Rose] Mm-hmm.

695
01:03:09,250 --> 01:03:10,166
I think so.

696
01:03:11,875 --> 01:03:14,041
[Phil] Watch your fires. Summer's coming.

697
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:18,750
Which also means any Indians camping
need to be moved off the property.

698
01:03:18,833 --> 01:03:20,000
No exceptions.

699
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:23,791
- We got animals they want to eat. Got it?
- [dog barking]

700
01:03:23,875 --> 01:03:25,375
[cowhands] Yes, sir.

701
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:26,875
We don't sell hides.

702
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:29,916
We don't sell anything here.

703
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,041
[whistles]

704
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:50,000
[cowhands laughing]

705
01:03:50,083 --> 01:03:52,125
Keep your eyes and ears open.

706
01:03:52,208 --> 01:03:55,000
Maybe find yourselves
an arrowhead up by them aspens.

707
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,500
[cowhands laughing]

708
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:01,250
[uneasy music playing]

709
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:19,833
[objects clattering]

710
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:39,041
Rose?

711
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:42,916
I have a headache.

712
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:49,750
Have a seat.

713
01:04:54,916 --> 01:04:56,666
I'm not eating tonight.

714
01:04:56,750 --> 01:05:02,166
It's George's week in town,
so it's just Phil.

715
01:05:03,458 --> 01:05:04,625
[Peter] Mm-hmm.

716
01:05:06,875 --> 01:05:08,458
I made a trap.

717
01:05:08,541 --> 01:05:11,291
Oh no. It's… it's not a snake, is it?

718
01:05:12,791 --> 01:05:14,500
[Rose chuckles sweetly]

719
01:05:15,583 --> 01:05:16,958
It's a bunny.

720
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,333
Oh. Oh! [shushing]

721
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,458
You're okay. [kissing]

722
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:22,875
[chuckles, kisses]

723
01:05:24,541 --> 01:05:26,291
[laughs, exclaims]

724
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:28,750
No, no, it's scared.

725
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,291
- [Peter] Come here.
- Get it, Peter.

726
01:05:30,375 --> 01:05:32,750
[Peter] Come here. Come here. Come here.

727
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:35,708
Bring him to me.

728
01:05:37,208 --> 01:05:38,166
Aw.

729
01:05:39,666 --> 01:05:41,125
[Rose murmuring indistinctly]

730
01:05:42,416 --> 01:05:43,375
[door opens]

731
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:45,625
[footsteps approaching]

732
01:05:52,291 --> 01:05:53,708
Don't worry about him.

733
01:05:55,750 --> 01:05:57,166
You can eat in your room.

734
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,833
[housekeeper] They dug up that graveyard
to make way for the new highway.

735
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:06,750
Among those buried there
was a friend of mine.

736
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:11,500
A clumsy tractor driver
broke open the coffin,

737
01:06:12,041 --> 01:06:17,208
and they found her hair
had continued to grow after her death.

738
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:24,000
The whole coffin just stuffed
with her lovely golden hair.

739
01:06:25,125 --> 01:06:27,250
Except for a few feet from the end,

740
01:06:28,791 --> 01:06:30,041
where it was gray.

741
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,500
Can I take it up?

742
01:06:35,583 --> 01:06:37,583
- [housekeeper] Some say she was a beauty.
- What?

743
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:39,875
[housekeeper] Golden braids
on top of her hair.

744
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:42,500
Oh! Yes, go and see. It's very sweet.

745
01:06:48,416 --> 01:06:49,916
- [knock on door]
- [door opens]

746
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,708
- No, please. Get out of my room.
- Where's your rabbit?

747
01:06:54,500 --> 01:06:56,291
[young housekeeper squeaking]

748
01:06:57,708 --> 01:06:58,833
I got it a carrot.

749
01:06:59,625 --> 01:07:00,708
It doesn't want one.

750
01:07:01,833 --> 01:07:02,833
Why?

751
01:07:02,916 --> 01:07:04,000
[squeaking]

752
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,333
[gasps]

753
01:07:08,250 --> 01:07:09,333
Holy hell.

754
01:07:18,041 --> 01:07:19,583
[clicks tongue] Shut the door.

755
01:07:20,791 --> 01:07:21,833
[door closes]

756
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:25,416
[sighs]

757
01:07:32,333 --> 01:07:35,000
Now, even if you're happy
being in your room all day,

758
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:36,416
it's good for me.

759
01:07:37,208 --> 01:07:39,000
- Mom, I have a lot to do.
- Come on.

760
01:07:40,333 --> 01:07:41,333
Peter…

761
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:44,708
I thought you liked rabbits.

762
01:07:46,750 --> 01:07:48,416
Yes. I do.

763
01:07:50,208 --> 01:07:52,666
But if I want to be a surgeon,
I have to practice.

764
01:07:53,833 --> 01:07:54,958
[scoffs]

765
01:07:55,041 --> 01:07:58,041
Well, you're not to kill them
in the house, Peter.

766
01:07:58,875 --> 01:08:00,500
No, I'm putting my foot down.

767
01:08:02,833 --> 01:08:05,375
Oh, where'd a man be
if he always did what his mother told him?

768
01:08:05,458 --> 01:08:06,458
I'll score.

769
01:08:11,333 --> 01:08:12,375
[Peter] Whoa!

770
01:08:12,958 --> 01:08:14,208
Point to Mrs. Burbank.

771
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,083
I know, Lola. You don't have to…

772
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,416
You don't have to narrate it.
I'll just… remember.

773
01:08:27,458 --> 01:08:30,250
- Whoo!
- [Lola] Yeah, that was definitely out.

774
01:08:30,333 --> 01:08:32,333
[indistinct chatter]

775
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:37,500

01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:43,875
[sighs]

777
01:08:45,416 --> 01:08:48,708
Lola, can you please take over?
I have a migraine.

778
01:08:49,541 --> 01:08:50,541
[Lola] Yeah.

779
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,291
- [cowhand 1] Where do you want me?
- Back there.

780
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,291
[cowhand 1] Yes, ma'am.

781
01:08:54,375 --> 01:08:55,875
- I hit that way.
- I was aiming for you.

782
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,291
[cowhand 2] Don't listen to Bobby.

783
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:58,708
[Peter] Are you all right, Mother?

784
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:01,833
[Rose sniffles] I feel like my eyes
are going to pop out of my head.

785
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:03,500
[breathing heavily]

786
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,958
It's Phil, isn't it?

787
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:16,500
He's cold.

788
01:09:16,583 --> 01:09:19,541
He's just a man, Peter, only another man.

789
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:22,333
You go ahead.

790
01:09:26,208 --> 01:09:27,250
[groans]

791
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:30,708

798
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:46,500

[cheering]

802
01:11:04,041 --> 01:11:06,166
Yeah? You want 'em off, do you?

803
01:11:06,250 --> 01:11:07,916
- [laughing]
- You want 'em off?

804
01:11:09,125 --> 01:11:09,958
Yeah, come on.

805
01:11:10,041 --> 01:11:11,666
Yeah, you want 'em?

806
01:11:11,750 --> 01:11:13,500
Yeah, you got 'em!

Get out of here, you little bitch!

814

You hear me?

815
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,541
[Peter grunts]

816
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:46,375

[Phil] Pete.

841
01:18:58,833 --> 01:18:59,875
Hey, Pete.

842
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,041
Peter.

843
01:19:08,416 --> 01:19:09,916
[Peter] You want me, Mr. Burbank?

844
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,250
[Phil] Well, I don't see
any Mr. Burbank here.

845
01:19:16,666 --> 01:19:17,916
I'm Phil.

846
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:19,791
Yes, Mr. Burbank.

847
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:23,041
I guess it's hard for a young'un like you
to call an old fella like me

848
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:26,166
just plain Phil, at first.

849
01:19:28,375 --> 01:19:30,041
Now come and take a look at this.

850
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,333
Have you done any braiding
or plaiting yourself, Pete?

851
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:40,166
No, I never have, sir.

852
01:19:45,083 --> 01:19:49,250
Peter, we kind of got off
on the wrong foot.

853
01:19:50,875 --> 01:19:53,333
- Did we, sir?
- [Phil] Forget the "sir" stuff.

854
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,250
That can happen to people.

855
01:19:57,875 --> 01:20:00,250
People who get to be good friends.

856
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,875
Well, you know what?

857
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:05,833
What? What, Phil?

858
01:20:08,875 --> 01:20:11,166
Now, you see? You did it.

859
01:20:12,166 --> 01:20:13,291
You called me Phil.

860
01:20:15,291 --> 01:20:19,250
I'm gonna finish this rope and give it
to you and teach you how to use it.

861
01:20:20,125 --> 01:20:23,500
Sort of a lonesome place out here, Pete.

862
01:20:24,416 --> 01:20:26,333
Unless you get in the swing of things.

863
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,458
Thank you… Phil.

864
01:20:31,958 --> 01:20:34,541
How long do you expect it would take
to finish that rope?

865
01:20:34,625 --> 01:20:37,375
I could get it finished
before you go back to school.

866

[chuckles]

867
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:42,166
[Peter] Well…

868
01:20:43,791 --> 01:20:45,458
It won't be very long then, Phil.

[Phil] Get on it.

874
01:21:54,708 --> 01:21:56,000
You can sit on it, Pete.

875
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,250
Get yourself used to it.

876
01:22:04,250 --> 01:22:05,458
You got any boots?

877
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:08,708
- [Peter] Yes.
- You should wear 'em.

878
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:13,375
Don't let your mom make a sissy of you.

879
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:25,541
[Peter] That's impressive, Phil.

880
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:29,166
Well, just by sitting there,

881
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:32,875
you're soaking up all the riding know-how
you'll ever need and then some.

882
01:22:33,666 --> 01:22:35,708
That saddle belonged to Bronco Henry.

883
01:22:37,416 --> 01:22:38,875
Greatest rider I ever knew.

884
01:22:46,708 --> 01:22:53,083
There's a cliff way out back of the ranch
with initials and 1805 carved into it.

885
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:56,250
Must have been some fella
from the Lewis and Clark Expedition.

886
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,750
They were real men in those days.

887
01:23:03,541 --> 01:23:06,333
Let's say just you and me
go out for a couple of days.

888
01:23:06,416 --> 01:23:08,708
Find those trails
and follow them to the end.

889
01:23:11,416 --> 01:23:14,541
Wouldn't be surprised if there were gold

890
01:23:15,458 --> 01:23:18,000
or precious minerals in them there rocks.

891
01:23:21,916 --> 01:23:24,291
[Peter] Do many of the calves
die from wolves?

892
01:23:27,333 --> 01:23:33,416
There's always a few that get…
tore up or hamstrung or die of anthrax.

893
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:34,375
Call it blackleg.

894
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:37,625
You know, you talk like a Victrola record.
You know that?

895
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:40,375
No, I didn't know.

896
01:23:40,958 --> 01:23:42,291
Yeah, well, you do.

897
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:54,708
- Did Bronco Henry teach you to ride, Phil?
- [Phil] Yep.

898
01:23:57,750 --> 01:24:01,541
He taught me to use my eyes
in ways that other people can't.

899
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,000
Take that hill over there.

900
01:24:12,041 --> 01:24:14,166
Most people look at it
and just see a hill.

901
01:24:15,375 --> 01:24:18,041
Where Bronco looked at it,
what do you suppose he saw?

902
01:24:22,375 --> 01:24:23,375
A barking dog.

903
01:24:25,166 --> 01:24:28,166
- The hell, you just saw that now?
- No.

904
01:24:29,416 --> 01:24:30,666
When I first came here.

905
01:24:31,458 --> 01:24:35,458
See, it looks like a dog
with its jaw wide open.

906
01:24:38,333 --> 01:24:39,833
You… you just saw that?

907
01:24:41,291 --> 01:24:42,125
Yeah.

908
01:24:42,208 --> 01:24:43,791
[running thumb over comb]

909
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:48,166
- [door opens]
- [Rose] Peter.

910
01:24:48,250 --> 01:24:49,916
[uneasy music playing]

911
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,000
Peter.

912
01:24:53,416 --> 01:24:55,458
Can't you come in and talk for a little?

913
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:11,416
You've gotten to be quite friendly
with Phil, haven't you?

914
01:25:16,208 --> 01:25:17,625
Is he nice to you?

915
01:25:17,708 --> 01:25:18,833
[running thumb over comb]

916
01:25:20,208 --> 01:25:21,541
He's making a rope for me.

917
01:25:23,291 --> 01:25:24,375
Making a rope?

918
01:25:27,166 --> 01:25:29,875
Peter, I wish you wouldn't make that sound
with your comb.

919
01:25:33,416 --> 01:25:34,500
I wasn't aware.

920
01:25:34,583 --> 01:25:36,333
[Rose] When I was little, I…

921
01:25:36,416 --> 01:25:40,625
I felt a chill in my spine when I heard
the chalk squeak on a blackboard.

922
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:46,208
Oh, Miss… [chuckling]
Mrs. Merchant, that's who it was.

923
01:25:47,541 --> 01:25:52,375
She… she drew chalk stars
by our names on the blackboard.

924
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,916
I wonder why it was stars she gave us.

925
01:25:58,416 --> 01:26:02,083
Why not diamonds? Why not hearts?

926
01:26:03,125 --> 01:26:05,708
Why not spades? [laughs] Why…

927
01:26:09,875 --> 01:26:13,375
I wonder why it was always stars.

928
01:26:14,916 --> 01:26:17,208
Because stars are supposed
to be unreachable.

929
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:20,291
[chuckles softly]

930
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:21,375
Yes.

931
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:25,666
But they weren't unreachable
because she gave them to us.

932
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,791
- And, Peter?
- [Peter] Hmm?

933
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:36,541
We had this valentine box,
and it was covered with white crepe paper.

934
01:26:38,416 --> 01:26:41,125
And we would paste big, red hearts on it.

935
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:44,416
Lopsided hearts. [chuckles]

936
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:46,333
And you had a great many valentines.

937
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:51,666
A great many?

938
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,500
[sighs]

939
01:26:55,833 --> 01:26:57,125
Because you're beautiful.

940
01:27:08,166 --> 01:27:10,458
Is there a sound that makes you shiver?

941
01:27:14,333 --> 01:27:16,041
[running thumb over comb]

942
01:27:19,750 --> 01:27:20,958
I don't remember.

943
01:27:24,333 --> 01:27:25,833
We're not unreachable.

944
01:27:30,833 --> 01:27:31,916
[Peter whispers] Hey.

945
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,750
No, we're not unreachable.

946
01:27:36,833 --> 01:27:39,250
Mother, you don't have to do this.

947
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:43,208
I'll see you don't have to do it.

948
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:54,083
[running thumb over comb]

949
01:27:54,166 --> 01:27:55,500
[cowhands laughing]

950
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:57,083
[indistinct chatter]

951
01:28:00,291 --> 01:28:02,333
- [Phil] This his first week?
- [cowhand 1] Nope, third.

952
01:28:02,416 --> 01:28:03,375
[Phil] Third?

953
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:06,208
Open up the gate. Let him out.

954
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:08,333
- You sure? He's not ready.
- Go on. Let him out.

955
01:28:09,208 --> 01:28:11,208
[cowhands laughing]

956
01:28:14,041 --> 01:28:15,083
[Phil grunts]

957
01:28:16,041 --> 01:28:18,791
- [cowhand 2] Yeehaw, cowboy! Whoo!
- [all laughing]

958
01:28:18,875 --> 01:28:19,833
There you go!

959
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,708
[cowhand 3] Grab her by the reins!

960
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:25,791
- [Phil] What you doing?
- Going to give him a hand.

961
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:26,875
Don't.

962
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:30,291
- Let him figure it out.
- [cowhand 4] Oh, oh!

963
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:31,375
[Phil] Or not.

964
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:32,750
[cowhands laughing]

965
01:28:33,833 --> 01:28:35,833
Fall off, you get back on.

966
01:28:37,291 --> 01:28:38,541
[cowhand 5] Get her over!

967
01:28:38,625 --> 01:28:40,458
[all laughing]

968
01:28:43,625 --> 01:28:45,625
[uneasy music playing]

969
01:29:26,583 --> 01:29:27,416
[grunting]

970
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:28,666
[shuddering]

971
01:29:30,833 --> 01:29:31,833
[yelps]

972
01:29:35,041 --> 01:29:36,583
[yelps and shudders]

973
01:29:54,291 --> 01:29:55,666
[flies buzzing]

974
01:30:36,583 --> 01:30:38,083
[flesh cutting]

975
01:30:49,625 --> 01:30:51,125
- [dog barks]
- [horse whinnies]

976
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:53,625
[George in distance]
Any happenings while I was away?

977
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:55,250
[Phil] Boys dug the ditch.

978
01:30:56,416 --> 01:30:57,916
Water's flowing good.

979
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,041
Fixing that stack there.

980
01:31:00,125 --> 01:31:02,333
[whistles] Hey, Pete!

981
01:31:02,416 --> 01:31:03,791
[whistles] Come here.

982
01:31:07,333 --> 01:31:09,041
Peter? Peter?

983
01:31:11,416 --> 01:31:13,125
[George] Where are you two off to?

984
01:31:14,208 --> 01:31:17,416
[Phil] We're going to the far field
to fence off the stack there.

985
01:31:17,500 --> 01:31:19,000
[Rose breathing heavily]

986
01:31:19,083 --> 01:31:20,083
Peter?

987
01:31:21,833 --> 01:31:23,208
- Rose?
- Peter!

988
01:31:23,291 --> 01:31:24,708
[panting]

989
01:31:25,666 --> 01:31:26,958
Rose, what's the matter?

990
01:31:27,041 --> 01:31:29,791
[grunts, panting]

991
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,166
[George] Rose?

992
01:31:33,250 --> 01:31:34,791
Can't Peter go with you today?

993
01:31:35,958 --> 01:31:39,208
Well, he could, but him and Phil
have kinda paired up.

994
01:31:39,291 --> 01:31:40,750
I don't want that.

995
01:31:40,833 --> 01:31:44,625
- I don't want him to be with Phil at all.
- But, Rose…

996
01:31:44,708 --> 01:31:45,666
[crying]

997
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:49,166
[splutters] He's helping him.
He taught him how to ride.

998
01:31:51,458 --> 01:31:52,583
[uneasy music playing]

999
01:32:45,041 --> 01:32:46,208
Hey, Pete, my pal.

1000
01:32:50,208 --> 01:32:51,625
Hey, Pete, my pal.

1001
01:32:52,958 --> 01:32:53,958
You gonna help?

1002
01:33:12,916 --> 01:33:15,125
You know who started riding
as late as you?

1003
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,750
- Who?
- Bronco Henry.

1004
01:33:20,208 --> 01:33:22,833
Hadn't done any of it
till he was about your age now.

1005
01:33:28,750 --> 01:33:30,166
Hello, Mr. Cottontail.

1006
01:33:37,541 --> 01:33:40,416
Hey, Peter, let's see how long it takes

1007
01:33:40,500 --> 01:33:43,166
before Mr. Cottontail
makes a run for the open.

1008
01:33:44,333 --> 01:33:49,416
Now, as kids,
we used to take bets… [grunts]

1009
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,416
…on how many poles we'd remove

1010
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:55,458
before the animals ran out
and made a run for it.

1011
01:34:06,791 --> 01:34:08,000
Oh, he's still in there.

1012
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,583
Gutsy little bugger.

1013
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:13,083
I guess he has to be gutsy.

1014
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,750
[Phil] Damn son of a bitch.

1015
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:32,250
[Peter] Come on, now. Come on.

1016
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:35,958
Think it broke his leg.

1017
01:34:37,666 --> 01:34:40,000
Well, put him out of his misery.

1018
01:34:44,625 --> 01:34:45,666
[Peter] Hmm.

1019
01:34:47,625 --> 01:34:48,625
It's all right.

1020
01:34:50,291 --> 01:34:51,291
[rabbit neck snaps]

1021
01:34:56,333 --> 01:34:57,708
[groans softly]

1022
01:35:04,083 --> 01:35:05,250
[Peter] That's deep.

1023
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,333
You okay, Phil?

1024
01:35:08,416 --> 01:35:09,500
Yeah, what the hell?

1025
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:13,083
Must be a splinter.

1026
01:35:31,083 --> 01:35:33,583
You got a tan.
That's a cowboy tan you got.

1027
01:35:34,416 --> 01:35:35,250
Hmm.

1028
01:35:40,875 --> 01:35:42,291
Bronco Henry told me that…

1029
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:47,208
A man was made
by patience and the odds against him.

1030
01:35:52,375 --> 01:35:54,041
[sighs] My father said…

1031
01:35:56,041 --> 01:35:57,208
Obstacles.

1032
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:01,041
And you had to try and remove them.

1033
01:36:01,125 --> 01:36:02,458
[Phil] Another way to put it.

1034
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:09,083
Well, you've certainly got obstacles.
That's a fact, Pete, me boy.

1035
01:36:10,791 --> 01:36:12,958
- [Peter] "Obstacles"?
- Well, take your ma.

1036
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,666
Today or any day…

1037
01:36:18,833 --> 01:36:20,083
How she's on the sauce.

1038
01:36:21,166 --> 01:36:22,375
[Peter] "On the sauce"?

1039
01:36:24,708 --> 01:36:25,708
Drinking, Pete.

1040
01:36:26,708 --> 01:36:27,833
Boozing it up.

1041
01:36:32,458 --> 01:36:34,500
I guess you know
she's been half-shot all summer.

1042
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:36,833
Yeah, I know.

1043
01:36:39,750 --> 01:36:40,958
She never used to drink.

1044
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:44,166
- Oh, didn't she now?
- [Peter] No.

1045
01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:48,125
- She never did.
- But your pa, Pete?

1046
01:36:49,875 --> 01:36:51,208
[Peter] My father?

1047
01:36:51,291 --> 01:36:52,500
Yeah, your father.

1048
01:36:55,416 --> 01:36:57,458
I guess he hit the bottle pretty hard?

1049
01:36:58,791 --> 01:36:59,791
The booze?

1050
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:04,291
Until right at the very end.

1051
01:37:10,625 --> 01:37:11,708
Then he hung himself.

1052
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:16,333
[gulps]

1053
01:37:16,875 --> 01:37:18,125
I found him.

1054
01:37:21,875 --> 01:37:22,875
Cut him down.

1055
01:37:31,166 --> 01:37:33,208
He used to worry I wasn't kind enough.

1056
01:37:36,958 --> 01:37:38,250
That I was too strong.

1057
01:37:38,333 --> 01:37:39,750
You, too strong?

1058
01:37:40,416 --> 01:37:41,333
[scoffs]

1059
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,041
He got that wrong.

1060
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:46,375
Poor kid.

1061
01:37:51,916 --> 01:37:53,583
Things will work out for you yet.

1062
01:37:56,083 --> 01:37:57,083
[Rose clears throat]

1063
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:00,333
[coughs]

1064
01:38:05,208 --> 01:38:06,416
Where's Mrs. Lewis?

1065
01:38:07,208 --> 01:38:08,416
She's with the Indians.

1066
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:12,125
What Indians?

1067
01:38:14,041 --> 01:38:14,875
These ones.

1068
01:38:14,958 --> 01:38:17,500
- [speaks Shoshone]
- You shouldn't even be here.

1069
01:38:18,625 --> 01:38:19,750
He won't like it.

1070
01:38:20,541 --> 01:38:21,791
Go now. Go.

1071
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:26,541
[footsteps approaching]

1072
01:38:26,625 --> 01:38:29,083
[Mrs. Lewis panting] Water!

1073
01:38:31,083 --> 01:38:34,291
They were standing right in front
of the damn things asking,

1074
01:38:34,375 --> 01:38:36,333
"Do we have any hides?"

1075
01:38:38,666 --> 01:38:41,958
"Do we have any hides?" Are they leaving?

1076
01:38:43,833 --> 01:38:45,625
Yes, they've got their horse going.

1077
01:38:46,416 --> 01:38:49,708
[Mrs. Lewis panting] I told them
the hides are gonna be burned.

1078
01:38:54,333 --> 01:38:55,416
Why?

1079
01:38:56,041 --> 01:38:58,291
Why are the hides going to be burned?

1080
01:38:58,375 --> 01:39:00,500
Phil doesn't want anyone else to have 'em.

1081
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,333
Waits till there's a big pile
and sets fire to the lot.

1082
01:39:05,416 --> 01:39:08,000
[chuckles] He'd blow up
if they even touched 'em.

1083
01:39:08,083 --> 01:39:10,041
[spluttering]

1084
01:39:10,125 --> 01:39:11,125
What's she doin'?

1085
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:13,208
[uneasy piano music playing]

1086
01:39:24,916 --> 01:39:27,500
[panting]

1087
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,125
Please, please.

1088
01:39:32,208 --> 01:39:33,833
Wait! Please!

1089
01:39:36,625 --> 01:39:38,708
Wait! Please, stop.

1090
01:39:39,583 --> 01:39:40,583
Please wait.

1091
01:39:40,666 --> 01:39:42,041
[panting]

1092
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:43,125
Please.

1093
01:39:44,125 --> 01:39:45,125
Come back.

1094
01:39:45,958 --> 01:39:47,333
Take the hides.

1095
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:50,916
It would be my honor
if you would take them.

1096
01:39:52,833 --> 01:39:53,833
Please.

1097
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:56,541
My husband owns the ranch.

1098
01:39:59,541 --> 01:40:01,125
Come back. Take them.

1099
01:40:03,541 --> 01:40:04,791
[man speaking Shoshone]

1100
01:40:10,458 --> 01:40:12,458
[uneasy music playing]

1101
01:40:28,625 --> 01:40:29,625
[chuckles softly]

1102
01:40:32,625 --> 01:40:34,083
They're so soft.

1103
01:40:36,416 --> 01:40:38,875
[crying softly] So deliciously soft.

1104
01:40:41,125 --> 01:40:42,125
So beautiful.

1105
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:49,583
[grunting]

1106
01:40:56,833 --> 01:40:58,291
[breathing heavily]

1107
01:41:04,166 --> 01:41:05,250
[gasps, grunts]

1108
01:41:07,958 --> 01:41:10,583
- [cowhand 1] You all right, ma'am?
- [cowhand 2] Is she breathing?

1109
01:41:10,666 --> 01:41:11,583
[cowhand 1] Ma'am.

1110
01:41:12,625 --> 01:41:13,958
- Ma'am.
- What happened?

1111
01:41:14,458 --> 01:41:16,125
[cowhand 2] She just collapsed, sir.

1112
01:41:19,708 --> 01:41:20,708
Rose?

1113
01:41:24,833 --> 01:41:26,500
[Rose groaning]

1114
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:43,500
[Lola] Sorry, sir.

1115
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:45,791
Thank you, Lola.

1116
01:41:57,708 --> 01:41:58,916
[Rose grunting]

1117
01:41:59,625 --> 01:42:00,500
[softly] Mine.

1118
01:42:03,875 --> 01:42:05,666
- [cowhand 1] Almost done.
- [cowhand 2] Howdy.

1119
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:07,541
- [cowhand 3] Hey, boss.
- [cowhand 4] All right.

1120
01:42:07,625 --> 01:42:09,833
[cowhands speaking indistinctly]

1121
01:42:19,416 --> 01:42:20,708
[Phil] I'll be damned.

1122
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,166
[grunts]

1123
01:42:22,791 --> 01:42:25,500
- [dramatic music playing]
- [Phil continues grunting]

1124
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,833
[breathing heavily]

1125
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:32,166
- [thud]
- [Phil grunts]

1126
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,375
Is there something wrong, Phil?

1127
01:42:34,458 --> 01:42:35,458
[Phil] Wrong?

1128
01:42:36,125 --> 01:42:37,791
For Christ's sake.

1129
01:42:37,875 --> 01:42:40,500
Every goddamn hide is gone!

1130
01:42:41,333 --> 01:42:43,958
Oh, she really put
her foot into it this time.

1131
01:42:45,833 --> 01:42:47,041
You think she did it?

1132
01:42:48,458 --> 01:42:50,208
- She sold them?
- Bloody tootin'.

1133
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:54,083
- Or maybe even gave them away.
- [Peter] Why? Why?

1134
01:42:54,166 --> 01:42:56,625
Why would she do that, Phil?
She knew that we needed the hides.

1135
01:42:56,708 --> 01:42:58,625
Because she was drunk!

1136
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:02,166
Pie-eyed! She was smashed!

1137
01:43:03,500 --> 01:43:05,500
I'd think you'd know
from the books your pa left you

1138
01:43:05,583 --> 01:43:07,916
that your ma's got a… a whatchamacallit.

1139
01:43:08,666 --> 01:43:12,500
Alcoholic personality.
It comes under the letter A!

1140
01:43:19,958 --> 01:43:23,208
- You're not gonna say anything to her?
- [Phil] Say anything?

1141
01:43:23,291 --> 01:43:24,625
I won't say nothin'.

1142
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:29,416
But sure as one good hell,
brother George is going to.

1143
01:43:38,875 --> 01:43:40,375
[George] Rose is not well, Phil.

1144
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,166
She's ill.

1145
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:48,375
Not well?

1146
01:43:48,458 --> 01:43:50,125
[breathing heavily]

1147
01:43:50,208 --> 01:43:54,625
It is high time
that that bozo and you got next to a few…

1148
01:43:54,708 --> 01:43:56,958
What do you ever call them? Facts!

1149
01:43:57,041 --> 01:44:02,083
She stashes alcohol all around the place,
even drinking in the stinking alley.

1150
01:44:04,708 --> 01:44:06,875
Look at your face in the mirror!

1151
01:44:06,958 --> 01:44:11,375
Is it that she could like?
Or our money? Wake the hell up!

1152
01:44:11,458 --> 01:44:12,541
That's enough, Phil.

1153
01:44:17,833 --> 01:44:20,500
Well, what is the harm?

1154
01:44:21,250 --> 01:44:23,208
The hides were only going to be burned.

1155
01:44:24,083 --> 01:44:25,166
I needed them.

1156
01:44:26,666 --> 01:44:28,250
I needed them.

1157
01:44:30,166 --> 01:44:31,583
Well, I apologize.

1158
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:44,291
They were mine!

1159
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,250
I needed them!

1160
01:45:01,291 --> 01:45:02,500
[sighs]

1161
01:45:05,458 --> 01:45:07,166
- Phil?
- Huh?

1162
01:45:14,333 --> 01:45:15,333
[Peter] Phil, I've…

1163
01:45:17,625 --> 01:45:19,458
I've got rawhide to finish the rope.

1164
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23,500
[Phil] You've got it?

1165
01:45:23,583 --> 01:45:25,541
What are you doing with rawhide?

1166
01:45:26,041 --> 01:45:27,125
I cut some up.

1167
01:45:28,500 --> 01:45:29,916
I wanted to be like you.

1168
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,458
Please take what I've got.

1169
01:45:37,500 --> 01:45:38,708
Well…

1170
01:45:38,791 --> 01:45:40,625
That's damn kind of you, Pete.

1171
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,208
Tell you something.

1172
01:46:00,250 --> 01:46:03,750
Everything's gonna be plain sailing
for you from now on in.

1173
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:08,583
And you know what?

1174
01:46:09,541 --> 01:46:10,541
I'm gonna work.

1175
01:46:11,958 --> 01:46:13,583
Finish up that rope tonight.

1176
01:46:16,958 --> 01:46:18,708
<i>You'll watch me do it?</i>

1177
01:46:18,791 --> 01:46:20,208
[uneasy music playing]

1178
01:48:40,083 --> 01:48:41,000
[dings]

1179
01:48:47,958 --> 01:48:50,083
How old were you
when you met Bronco Henry?

1180
01:48:52,291 --> 01:48:53,708
About the age you are now.

1181
01:49:04,250 --> 01:49:05,458
Was he your best friend?

1182
01:49:06,833 --> 01:49:10,166
Yeah… he was.

1183
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:12,833
He was more than that.

1184
01:49:15,000 --> 01:49:16,541
Once, he saved my life.

1185
01:49:23,458 --> 01:49:27,583
We were way off up in the hills
shooting elk, and the weather turned mean.

1186
01:49:30,083 --> 01:49:35,666
Bronco kept me alive
by… lying body against body in a bedroll.

1187
01:49:39,291 --> 01:49:40,875
Fell off to sleep that way.

1188
01:49:46,833 --> 01:49:47,833
Naked?

1189
01:49:51,000 --> 01:49:51,833
[chuckles]

[uneasy music playing]

1192
01:51:43,916 --> 01:51:46,375
- [cowhand 1] Phil left already?
- [cowhand 2] No, he's not here.

1193
01:51:48,708 --> 01:51:50,416
He say he was settin' out early?

1194
01:51:50,500 --> 01:51:51,500
[cowhand 2] No.

1195
01:51:56,958 --> 01:51:58,083
[George] Good mornin'.

1196
01:51:59,208 --> 01:52:00,625
Have you seen your brother?

1197
01:52:03,000 --> 01:52:04,416
He's not had breakfast?

1198
01:52:06,458 --> 01:52:07,916
He's not been down at all.

1199
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:13,250
[cowhand 3] Can I get
some of that coffee please?

1200
01:52:31,500 --> 01:52:33,708
I'll run you into Herndon
to see the doctor.

1201
01:52:34,375 --> 01:52:35,416
[Phil groans softly]

1202
01:52:59,541 --> 01:53:00,458
[George] Phil…

1203
01:53:02,541 --> 01:53:04,083
What happened to your hand?

1204
01:53:07,625 --> 01:53:08,958
Let's get your boots off.

1205
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:19,041
[Phil grunts]

1206
01:53:19,875 --> 01:53:21,208
I'm… I'm good.

1207
01:53:30,208 --> 01:53:31,625
[George] I'll get the car.

1208
01:53:34,500 --> 01:53:35,833

[George] Let's go, Phil.

1212
01:54:40,125 --> 01:54:41,291
Where's the boy?

1213
01:55:04,875 --> 01:55:05,791
Phil.

1214
01:55:15,333 --> 01:55:16,333
I'll get it to him.

1215
01:55:25,291 --> 01:55:26,125

[engine splutters]

1218
01:56:09,708 --> 01:56:10,958
I'll take this one.

1219
01:56:13,416 --> 01:56:14,250
Uh…

1220
01:56:17,166 --> 01:56:19,291

[indistinct chatter]

1226
01:58:16,083 --> 01:58:22,666
Rose would like you to join us
for Christmas, if you care to.

1227
01:58:26,458 --> 01:58:27,291
Yes.

1228
01:58:28,416 --> 01:58:29,583
Thank you, George.

1229
01:58:34,875 --> 01:58:36,208
I'm afraid I'm mystified.

1230
01:58:37,166 --> 01:58:39,833
I'll know in a day or two
when the results come back.

1231
01:58:40,666 --> 01:58:41,958
Those last convulsions…

1232
01:58:44,333 --> 01:58:47,458
- Yes?
- Terrible, truly frightful.

1233
01:58:49,458 --> 01:58:50,833
You know what I'm thinking?

1234
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:52,666
What?

1235
01:58:53,750 --> 01:58:54,750
Anthrax.

1236
01:58:59,458 --> 01:59:02,666
But he never handled diseased animals.

1237
01:59:02,750 --> 01:59:04,458
He was particular on that.
