Hi.

18
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:01,166
It's beautiful, isn't it?

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,233
The lights...
the music...

20
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,066
It's my favourite time
of the year.

21
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm pretty sure you're
contractually obligated

22
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:09,367
to say that, wearing that suit.

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,834
Suit?

24
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,667
What suit?
This is just me on a Tuesday.

25
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,533
Aren't you kinda young
for Santa?

26
00:01:15,667 --> 00:01:17,533
I mean, I usually picture him

27
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:20,200
with a little more seniority.

28
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,967
Maybe a bit more of a gut.

29
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,166
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,333
It's the Christmas spirit that
keeps me young.

31
00:01:26,467 --> 00:01:28,000
That and a strict
jogging routine.

32
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:29,333
Okay.

33
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,834
Good night.

34
00:01:32,433 --> 00:01:34,533
Hey, um...

35
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:36,834
Mind if I get your name?

36
00:01:36,967 --> 00:01:38,567
It's not on your list?

37
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,367
I thought you checked
that thing twice.

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,400
Well, the elves have been
slacking a bit this year.

39
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:46,133
They're a bit behind
on their paperwork.

40
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,767
Got it. You blame
the elves. Okay.

41
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,200
It's Taylor. Taylor Nichols.

42
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:57,367
Taylor Nichols.
Oh, yes, I remember now.

43
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,867
Yes, I did spot that name
on my list.

44
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:03,700
And was it on the "nice" column,
or the "naughty" column?

45
00:02:03,834 --> 00:02:07,867
You know, I've come here just
about as far back

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
as I can remember, but I don't
remember ever seeing you here.

47
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:14,734
Well, Santa,

48
00:02:14,867 --> 00:02:19,633
that's 'cause it's my first
Christmas back since...

49
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:23,266
Since I left a few years ago.

50
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,066
Well, let Santa be the first one
to welcome you back.

51
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,133
So, Taylor Nichols,
what do you want Santa

52
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:29,934
to bring you this year?

53
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,367
I'm sorry, I have to get going.

54
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,767
My grandfather's expecting me
at his store, so...

55
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,300
Come on, everyone has a
Christmas wish.

56
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:39,699
Something they want more than
anything else in the world.

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,066
What is it?

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
Some Christmas wishes just can't
be granted.

59
00:02:50,867 --> 00:02:53,633
No matter how bright the lights,

60
00:02:53,767 --> 00:02:56,800
or how beautiful the tree.

61
00:02:56,934 --> 00:03:01,467
Christmas isn't about bright
lights and ribbons.

62
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,033
It's about a feeling
you get inside.

63
00:03:05,166 --> 00:03:08,967
The feeling that even the most
unlikely Christmas wish

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,000
could come true.

65
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,934
Taylor Nichols,

66
00:03:13,066 --> 00:03:16,266
whatever that Christmas wish is,

67
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,200
I hope it comes true.

68
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:20,700
Candy cane?

69
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,033
Ho-ho-ho.

70
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,133
Oh, Merry Christmas!

71
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:33,633
Ho-ho-ho!

72
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,800
Wait, I didn't get your...

73
00:03:35,934 --> 00:03:38,867
Ho-ho-ho!
Merry Christmas!

74
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
Name.

75
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,633
Santa.

76
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,300
Frank:
Merry Christmas.

77
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:04,266
Grandpa Frank!
Excuse me one moment.

78
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,166
There she is!
Welcome home, kiddo!

79
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,266
Oh, it's so good to see you!
You too!

80
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,700
How you doing, you doing okay?
You're not too tired?

81
00:04:13,834 --> 00:04:15,366
Those bus trips can take
everything out of you.

82
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:17,166
No, I'm good, I'm good.

83
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,033
I'm just happy to be back here.

84
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:23,734
I'm sorry it was so last-minute.
Work has been crazy.

85
00:04:23,867 --> 00:04:26,000
That editor of yours still
cracking the whip?

86
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,367
Like Santa with his reindeer.
You know it.

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:31,667
It's busy in here.
Last minute Christmas rush.

88
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,166
And it's just you?

89
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,066
Had trouble finding help.

90
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,433
Why don't I stay and help

91
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,867
and you and I close up together?

92
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,867
No, no, you're on vacation.
Come on.

93
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,934
Grandpa, there's nowhere else
I'd rather be

94
00:04:42,066 --> 00:04:43,500
than right here with you.

95
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:46,333
I was hoping you'd say that.

96
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,667
Got one just your size!

97
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,266
I love it.

98
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,166
Woman:
That's for you...

99
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,734
Man:
Okay, thank you.

100
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,000
And... and...
Go, go, go, go, go!

101
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:18,734
Yes!

102
00:05:18,867 --> 00:05:20,500
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

103
00:05:20,633 --> 00:05:23,734
Merry Christmas!
Charlie: Hey, Luke!

104
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:26,233
Home just in time.
Why don't you take a seat

105
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,232
and grab one of those glue guns
and help us out.

106
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:30,433
Your mom and I are on a roll.

107
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:33,433
Yes, we just broke our old
record by 15 seconds.

108
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,834
Wow.
So if you could handle

109
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:39,433
the pasting, wreath-laying,
and tissue paper,

110
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:42,767
and Charlie takes care of tinsel
and chocolate,

111
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,632
I think we can get there
in under a minute.

112
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,100
Charlie:
Remember what I taught you.

113
00:05:46,233 --> 00:05:48,065
The secret to the perfect
Christmas gift basket

114
00:05:48,066 --> 00:05:49,600
is structure.

115
00:05:49,734 --> 00:05:51,800
It's all about a solid
foundation of chicken-wire.

116
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,800
Lets the wicker hold the weight
ten times.

117
00:05:54,934 --> 00:05:56,900
Yes, Dad, I remember.
You taught me well.

118
00:05:57,033 --> 00:05:58,467
And how was your night?

119
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,400
Did you make any Christmas
wishes come true?

120
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,467
It was pretty good.
Yeah?

121
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,900
Yeah, I made a lot
of kids laugh.

122
00:06:04,033 --> 00:06:05,734
And a few adults, too.
Ah!

123
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:08,633
Well, it's a very nice thing
you did tonight.

124
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:11,066
The world could always use
a little more holiday cheer,

125
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,533
and more men in uniform.
And...

126
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:16,367
Charlie, are you sure
you washed this thing out

127
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,233
after last Christmas?

128
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,767
I am putting this in
the laundry.

129
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,033
Speaking of uniforms, son...

130
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,926
I just heard from my old friend,
Clay Murphy.

131
00:06:27,033 --> 00:06:28,567
Colonel Clay Murphy?
That's right.

132
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,166
Seems you're impressing all the
right people out there.

133
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,800
I heard promotion chatter.

134
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,400
Promotion?

135
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:38,333
I thought that would have taken
years to achieve.

136
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:41,567
Honey, Luke just got home.

137
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,633
Do we really need to talk about
him leaving?

138
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:46,033
No, you're certainly right.

139
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,800
Hey, Peggy, would you please
pass me the packing tape?

140
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:50,467
And Luke?

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,300
Do you mind getting me another
one of these eggnogs?

142
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,667
You know that that's my
Christmas wish.

143
00:06:58,433 --> 00:07:00,113
Do you guys have any more of
those baskets?

144
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,793
Preferably one that's candy
cane-themed?

145
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,400
Uh.. oh, yes!

146
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:05,967
Will this one do?

147
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,700
That's perfect.

148
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,300
Frank: What a day.
Thanks for closing up with me.

149
00:07:17,433 --> 00:07:20,800
Nothing like a bowl of hot and
sour soup on Christmas Eve.

150
00:07:22,834 --> 00:07:24,767
Reminds me of your mother.

151
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,900
Yeah.

152
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,133
She knew how to appreciate the
good things in life,

153
00:07:29,266 --> 00:07:30,667
your mother.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,900
I've got something to show you.

155
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:47,133
You framed my first published
article?

156
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:49,734
My first online
published article,

157
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:52,300
which means
you had it printed out?

158
00:07:52,433 --> 00:07:55,066
Of course I framed it. That's
what you do with a work of art.

159
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,567
I can't tell you how much I love
reading your stories.

160
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:02,800
Like a special Christmas morning
edition, every time.

161
00:08:02,934 --> 00:08:07,000
That last one, with that quote
from Charles Dickens?

162
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:08,867
"Remembrance, like a candle,

163
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,300
"burns brightest at
Christmastime."

164
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:14,333
Makes me think of when we first
bring the tree inside.

165
00:08:14,467 --> 00:08:18,133
You know, suddenly the whole
house smells like Christmas.

166
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:20,700
The smile on your mother's face,

167
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,433
just grinning
with anticipation...

168
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:25,500
Or how the whole kitchen
would come alive

169
00:08:25,633 --> 00:08:27,934
when she'd bake a batch
of her gingerbread cookies.

170
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,533
Right.

171
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,033
You know, mom used to tell me

172
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,600
the most important part
of Christmas

173
00:08:37,734 --> 00:08:41,166
is to take the time to
truly savour it.

174
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,867
Because time is our most
precious gift of all.

175
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
Speaking of time, Taylor,

176
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:49,265
how much longer do I have you
here with me?

177
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:52,033
Three days, a week at best.

178
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:54,100
They need me back at the paper.

179
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:56,767
I'm actually supposed to be
working while I'm here.

180
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,467
I have a few leads on a few
human interest stories, so...

181
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,700
Just like your mom.
Always on the clock.

182
00:09:04,834 --> 00:09:07,967
I see so much of her in you.

183
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,200
I could say the same
about you, Grandpa.

184
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:16,000
Your smile, your laugh.

185
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:18,166
The way you'd rather risk
a stomach ache

186
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,934
than leave a single crumb
on your plate.

187
00:09:21,066 --> 00:09:24,000
You remind me of her, too.

188
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:26,834
Here's to running in the family!

189
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:36,033
I wonder who that is.
Can't be carolers.

190
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,499
I think I scared them
off last Christmas

191
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,467
bringing out my bagpipes.

192
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,600
Who was that?
I don't know.

193
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,166
There's a note here.

194
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,133
It says, "From Santa."

195
00:12:12,033 --> 00:12:14,667
I miss you, Mom.

196
00:12:18,133 --> 00:12:20,100
Merry Christmas.

197
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,233
Taylor?

198
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,333
Taylor Nichols, right?

199
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,633
We met earlier tonight.
I was all dressed in red,

200
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,834
fluffy white lapels.

201
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,567
"Ho-ho-ho"?

202
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,467
Well, if it isn't Santa Claus!

203
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,033
I'm surprised you can even
recognize me without my beard.

204
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,500
How could I forget?

205
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,200
Meeting the real Santa.

206
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:58,300
I still have your gift.

207
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,967
It's a whole lot of candy cane,
to be honest.

208
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,467
I'm gonna be working on this
thing through next New Year's.

209
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,400
I've been carrying it for
self-defence.

210
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,300
Wow.

211
00:13:09,433 --> 00:13:12,200
By the way, thanks for the
gift basket.

212
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,700
Luke:
Oh, don't worry about it.

213
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:15,265
You know, my family and I are
pretty famous

214
00:13:15,266 --> 00:13:16,967
around these parts for them.

215
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,133
We like to help Santa out with
any last-minute deliveries.

216
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:23,734
I was actually just delivering
my last basket right now

217
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:26,467
when I saw you sitting here.

218
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,367
You're not waiting for a bus,
are you?

219
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,533
Because you're gonna be waiting
a long time.

220
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,432
The next bus doesn't come until
tomorrow afternoon.

221
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:34,467
No, I know.

222
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,667
I'm not going anywhere.

223
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,400
But I'm not really here, either.

224
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:45,767
I see. Uh...

225
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,233
Mind if I sit?

226
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,734
Please.

227
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:58,033
You know, coming home
can be hard.

228
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:03,467
It's like a mirror into
your past.

229
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,633
Keeping stock,

230
00:14:05,767 --> 00:14:09,600
making you remember just
who you are.

231
00:14:09,734 --> 00:14:11,666
At least, that's what I read on
a church billboard

232
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,934
on the way over here.

233
00:14:14,066 --> 00:14:17,867
I'm Luke, by the way.
Luke Malone.

234
00:14:24,066 --> 00:14:27,433
I pictured you more as Chris.

235
00:14:27,567 --> 00:14:29,467
Or maybe a Nick.

236
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,600
I'm not so sure Luke suits you.

237
00:14:31,734 --> 00:14:34,700
It's more "outer space" and
less "Pere Noel."

238
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,633
Okay, well, how about
Bob Cratchit?

239
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:40,166
Or Tiny Tim, then?

240
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,633
Ah, a Charles Dickens fan,
no less.

241
00:14:43,767 --> 00:14:46,033
Well, I only know
A Christmas Carol.

242
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:47,600
And I didn't even read the book,

243
00:14:47,734 --> 00:14:50,700
I just saw the stage play once
with my parents.

244
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,767
Which reminds me, I...

245
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,700
I have some people waiting
on me,

246
00:14:56,834 --> 00:14:59,266
I should... I should get going.

247
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:03,667
Hey, what's your plan?
Can I...

248
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,400
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

249
00:15:05,533 --> 00:15:06,967
Um...

250
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,734
No.

251
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,467
I think I'm good to walk, thanks.

252
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,767
Okay, well,

253
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:21,166
it was great bumping into you
again, Taylor.

254
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,166
Nice bumping into you too, Luke.

255
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:32,000
Um, I wanted to thank you.

256
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Tonight.

257
00:15:36,734 --> 00:15:40,533
It's the two year anniversary of
my mother's passing.

258
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,367
And ever since then,

259
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,066
well, Christmas,
it's felt like this...

260
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,900
thing that I'm looking at
from the outside.

261
00:15:54,033 --> 00:15:57,033
Like home is this town that
I'm a tourist in.

262
00:15:59,066 --> 00:16:02,233
Tonight you helped me find a bit
of that magic again.

263
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,700
You made it feel a little more
like home.

264
00:16:09,133 --> 00:16:10,900
So, thanks.

265
00:16:15,133 --> 00:16:18,667
Well, I'd like to take credit
for that, but that wasn't me.

266
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,066
That was Old Saint Nick.

267
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,600
Ah.

268
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:26,433
Merry Christmas, Luke Malone!

269
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,633
Merry Christmas, Taylor Nichols.

270
00:16:29,767 --> 00:16:34,333
And remember, the best gifts
don't have bows.

271
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,100
Woman: It's Christmas time again,

272
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,734
a time for gift-giving and
well-wishing.

273
00:17:00,867 --> 00:17:03,533
Stocking stuffing
and carol singing.

274
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:05,667
A time for all those children
out there,

275
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,667
dreaming of their toys.

276
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,166
A time when, as Dickens wrote,

277
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,400
"A thousand odours float
in the air,

278
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,867
"each one connected with
a thousand thoughts

279
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,834
"and hopes and joys."

280
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:20,033
So make your lists,
and check them twice.

281
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:24,100
Even Santa Claus will tell you,
the best gifts don't have bows.

282
00:17:28,934 --> 00:17:30,800
So?

283
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,500
What do you think?

284
00:17:32,633 --> 00:17:35,367
Overall, I think you nailed it.

285
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,967
You are really hitting your
stride, Taylor.

286
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,867
You are fast becoming
our go-to voice

287
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,633
for everything Christmas.
Oh, wow.

288
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,667
But the irony is,

289
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,500
I'm not all that sure you even
enjoy the holidays.

290
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,200
No decorations at your desk,
no crazy quilted sweater.

291
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:53,667
I don't think I've once
seen you belt back

292
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,233
a peppermint latte.

293
00:17:55,367 --> 00:17:57,800
I suppose I'm more of an
inwardly-celebrating

294
00:17:57,934 --> 00:18:00,100
holiday goer.
Well, whatever the case is,

295
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,600
you are mining pure tinsel
up there, Taylor.

296
00:18:02,734 --> 00:18:04,467
Have a safe trip home.

297
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,400
Fingers crossed for your first
front page.

298
00:18:07,533 --> 00:18:10,700
Front page? Really?

299
00:18:10,834 --> 00:18:12,099
If the work stays at this
high level,

300
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,400
I don't see why not.

301
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,900
I'll see you when I get back.

302
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,266
And, Barb? Merry Christmas.

303
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
Merry Christmas.

304
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,133
So, excited to head home?

305
00:18:32,266 --> 00:18:34,900
Five and a half hours on a
crowded passenger bus?

306
00:18:35,033 --> 00:18:36,567
I'm thrilled!
Well...

307
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,300
Maybe you'll get a visit from a
certain Santa Claus.

308
00:18:40,433 --> 00:18:42,233
I doubt he'd even remember me.

309
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,600
Who knows if he's even around
this year.

310
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:47,700
Uh, he remembers the names of 6
billion people every Christmas,

311
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,767
I'm sure he'll remember yours.

312
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,333
Thank you, Bonnie,
for the perspective.

313
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,265
I'm telling you, Luke,
the community spirit

314
00:19:01,266 --> 00:19:02,633
is off the charts.

315
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,500
Everybody's asking to help
at the dinner.

316
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:08,433
Well, whatever you and mom are
doing seems to be working.

317
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:10,033
I think your mom is
just so happy

318
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,999
that you were able to come home
again this year.

319
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,433
You've been spoiling us.

320
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,934
I wish it was every year,
believe me.

321
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:18,000
Ah, it's perfect!
Ain't it, though?

322
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,467
I think that it's our best
find yet.

323
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,533
Excellent height, colour,
branch distribution.

324
00:19:23,667 --> 00:19:26,266
Our boy certainly hasn't lost
his touch.

325
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,433
It's like you've always had this
sense, Luke.

326
00:19:28,567 --> 00:19:30,967
You can always pick out just
the right one.

327
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,700
Charlie: A dowsing rod
for Douglas Firs.

328
00:19:32,834 --> 00:19:34,833
Yes, and you've been telling
that story every year since.

329
00:19:34,834 --> 00:19:36,767
Well, it's a holiday classic.

330
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,166
Now I know some folks prefer
Fraser Fir

331
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,367
because there's more room
for ornaments,

332
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,266
but you just can't beat that
fresh...

333
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,100
Douglas smell.

334
00:19:45,233 --> 00:19:48,600
"A thousand odours fill the air,
and with them,

335
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:52,734
"connected a thousand thoughts,
hopes, and joys."

336
00:19:55,767 --> 00:19:57,934
It's Charles Dickens.

337
00:19:58,066 --> 00:20:00,333
Since when did you get
so literary?

338
00:20:00,467 --> 00:20:02,834
I'm expanding my horizons.

339
00:20:02,967 --> 00:20:04,200
Uh-huh.

340
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,767
I'm reading more.

341
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,266
Right...

342
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,800
Okay, where do you
want the tree?

343
00:20:09,934 --> 00:20:11,433
Over there.

344
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,734
Have yourself a Merry Christmas!

345
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:39,667
Taylor, you're here.

346
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,834
Hi, Grandpa.

347
00:20:41,967 --> 00:20:43,600
Oh!

348
00:20:43,734 --> 00:20:45,367
Have you grown? You look taller.

349
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,834
No, it's just the boots,
I swear.

350
00:20:47,967 --> 00:20:49,200
So, what ya been up to?

351
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,767
I've been reading
all your articles.

352
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,100
Not much to report since
our last phone call. I...

353
00:20:54,233 --> 00:20:58,967
I work, eat, sleep, work.

354
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,165
You manage to get that editor of
yours to finally take notice?

355
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:03,834
As a matter of fact,
I think I did.

356
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:06,233
She told me
I'm front page ready.

357
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:09,166
Front page ready? Oh!

358
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,066
I am so proud of you, Taylor.

359
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,567
Your mother, she'd...

360
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,232
Well, I think you know
how she'd feel.

361
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,867
I do.

362
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,433
You got that extra apron handy?

363
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:18,700
Coming right up.

364
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:28,786
The sing-along was
such a big hit last year,

365
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:31,033
we decided to add
a couple of new carols.

366
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,500
That's great.

367
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,132
And your mother got
the whole church choir

368
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:35,733
to sing along with us
while we serve dinner.

369
00:21:35,734 --> 00:21:37,900
Well, thanks, no doubt,
to the example of

370
00:21:38,033 --> 00:21:39,600
their hard-working director.

371
00:21:39,734 --> 00:21:41,567
I just want it to
be nice for everyone.

372
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,032
You know,
for some of these folks,

373
00:21:43,033 --> 00:21:44,734
this is as close
as they get to spending

374
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,834
Christmas with family.

375
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:48,499
Charlie: These old lights
aren't working.

376
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,165
Guess we're going to
have to get some new ones.

377
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:51,667
I'm sure Frank's is still open.

378
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,666
Yeah, I'll just get
a couple of boxes of lights.

379
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,834
Great.

380
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:57,533
Let me take a look.

381
00:21:57,667 --> 00:21:59,433
Are you sure you plugged it in?

382
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:09,834
There you are.
Merry Christmas.

383
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:17,967
What can we help you with?

384
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,020
Well, I'm just looking
for some Christmas lights.

385
00:22:28,734 --> 00:22:30,333
Taylor.

386
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,400
Luke.

387
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:38,533
Hi.

388
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:42,533
Um...

389
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:45,233
Hi.

390
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,533
Luke: These two.

391
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:56,867
That's a lot of lights.

392
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,367
Well, it's a lot of tree.

393
00:23:00,867 --> 00:23:02,934
So, how will you be paying?

394
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:06,166
Oh, you can charge it, Wynona.

395
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,000
It says "Wynona."

396
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:12,467
Oh, yeah. No.
It's still Taylor. I promise.

397
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,066
I didn't know
that you worked here.

398
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,066
I... I don't.

399
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,934
I do.

400
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,633
It's my grandfather's store.

401
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:22,133
I help out when I'm home.

402
00:23:22,266 --> 00:23:24,100
Oh, Grandpa Frank, this is...

403
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,500
Malone! Luke Malone.

404
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:26,967
Frank. Good to see you.

405
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,900
Good to see you, too.

406
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:30,366
Luke's been coming around here
since he was about yea high.

407
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,000
I didn't know
you two were related.

408
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:35,567
You telling me you can't
see the resemblance?

409
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,100
Well, the mustache does throw
it off a little bit, Frank.

410
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:41,066
You dropped off a gift basket
at the house last year.

411
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,232
That was you?

412
00:23:42,233 --> 00:23:44,333
Well, that was... that was Santa,

413
00:23:44,467 --> 00:23:47,166
he asked one of his elf friends
who works for the city

414
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,967
what Taylor Nichols'
address was,

415
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,500
and that was the address he got.

416
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:55,066
Blaming the elves again, huh?

417
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,933
Well, I'm gonna be
in the back if you need me.

418
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,066
Merry Christmas, Luke.

419
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,667
Merry Christmas.

420
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,500
So, a little late
to be decorating.

421
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,473
I'm helping my parents
at the community centre,

422
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,599
and every year we just try
to go a little bit bigger.

423
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh, for the Veteran's Dinner.

424
00:24:09,133 --> 00:24:11,133
Yes. Yeah, we're planning
on having enough lights

425
00:24:11,266 --> 00:24:14,066
to land a 747 this year.

426
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,066
Well, um...

427
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,333
There you go.
Thanks.

428
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,166
It was, um...

429
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,900
It was good seeing you.

430
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:25,633
Yeah. You, too.

431
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,567
Listen, Taylor,

432
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:33,233
I know you're
probably busy tonight,

433
00:24:33,367 --> 00:24:34,567
I mean, of all nights,

434
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:36,900
um, but I was wondering...

435
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,653
Do you want to
do something later?

436
00:24:41,367 --> 00:24:42,867
I have to stay
and help my grandpa,

437
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,166
it's a really busy night, so.

438
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,867
Nonsense, dear. I got this.

439
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,467
You two go
and enjoy your little date.

440
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,700
It's not a date.

441
00:24:50,834 --> 00:24:52,266
Well, it could be.

442
00:24:54,867 --> 00:24:56,667
You want to go?

443
00:25:02,734 --> 00:25:04,233
Have fun!

444
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:07,000
Sure.

445
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,567
So, have you been keeping up
with your Charles Dickens?

446
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,660
I heard they're making
an animated kids version of

447
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:19,367
Great Expectations.

448
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,400
"I will honour
Christmas in my heart,

449
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:23,867
"and try to keep it
all the year."

450
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,033
Wait, have you been
reading my old articles?

451
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,867
I might have got a bit curious.

452
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,100
Down a rabbit hole.

453
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,967
Gosh, now I feel so exposed.

454
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,165
Don't.

455
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:35,300
It's good. It's really great.

456
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,300
Thanks.

457
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:37,834
So, what your next story about?

458
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,800
Oh, gosh.
I have an interview scheduled.

459
00:25:42,934 --> 00:25:44,066
I have to go.

460
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,567
Oh, um, well...

461
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,400
If you want, I could help you.

462
00:25:47,533 --> 00:25:48,867
How handy are you with a camera?

463
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,033
I know where to
not put my thumbs.

464
00:25:51,166 --> 00:25:52,900
That'll do. Come on.

465
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,867
These are beautiful,
Mrs. Grantham.

466
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:01,834
Oh, honey, call me Annie.

467
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:03,633
Alright, Annie.

468
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:06,300
Hi, Annie. I'm... I'm Luke.

469
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:07,834
A big fan of your work.

470
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,133
Oh. Why, thank you.

471
00:26:10,266 --> 00:26:14,133
So, when did you start
crocheting Christmas ornaments?

472
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:17,767
When my first grand-daughter
was born a few years back,

473
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,834
I wanted to do
something special,

474
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:21,600
you know,
for baby's first Christmas.

475
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:24,467
So, I picked up
my yarn and my hooks,

476
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,967
and just let
the inspiration take me.

477
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,767
Just like that.

478
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,800
Oh, once the rest of the family
saw how the first few came out,

479
00:26:31,934 --> 00:26:34,834
I started getting requests
from my own children

480
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:37,133
and my grandchildren
and all their friends,

481
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:40,133
and next thing you knew
I was shipping to strangers

482
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,667
as far away as Katmandu!

483
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,533
And I understand
that all of the proceeds

484
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:47,533
go to a local charity?

485
00:26:47,667 --> 00:26:48,967
I save some for the phone bills,

486
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,767
but it's just me here alone now,

487
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,834
so it just kinda made sense.

488
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:57,800
Do you mind if we take
some pictures for the article?

489
00:26:57,934 --> 00:26:59,800
Oh, you go right ahead.

490
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:03,333
Great. Uh, why don't we get you
guys by the Christmas tree?

491
00:27:03,467 --> 00:27:04,667
Here.

492
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,333
I'll help you up.

493
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:09,767
Oh, thank you.

494
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,133
Ready?

495
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,433
So, tell me, Luke,

496
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:17,533
how long have you
been with the military?

497
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:22,100
What gave me away?

498
00:27:22,233 --> 00:27:24,567
Oh, let's just say
I recognize the posture.

499
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:27,200
A certain straightening
to the spine.

500
00:27:27,333 --> 00:27:28,934
I've been around it
most of my life.

501
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:31,166
My late husband,

502
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,867
he looked great in uniform.

503
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Well...

504
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,500
Alright, here we go.

505
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,500
So, you're in the military?

506
00:27:50,133 --> 00:27:51,533
Captain Luke Malone.

507
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,100
U.S. Army Infantry.

508
00:27:54,233 --> 00:27:55,700
Captain.

509
00:27:55,834 --> 00:27:58,233
Wow, I... I had no idea.

510
00:27:58,367 --> 00:28:00,400
Well, you know, I don't like
to talk about it much

511
00:28:00,533 --> 00:28:02,734
when I'm home for the holidays.

512
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,767
I spend so little time here,
it just reminds me

513
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,934
that I'm going to be gone again.

514
00:28:07,066 --> 00:28:09,000
I think it's important
to stay in the present.

515
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:11,000
So...

516
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:13,266
So, the night we met,

517
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,066
I was going on about
my own inner crisis

518
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,300
and were you about to ship off?

519
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:21,233
I like the fact that you thought
that you could talk to me.

520
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,433
And I'm glad that
I was there to listen.

521
00:28:24,567 --> 00:28:25,934
Me, too.

522
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,400
A few hours ago,
I barely knew your name.

523
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:37,633
So, why does it feel like now

524
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:41,400
you're some sort of long lost...

525
00:28:41,533 --> 00:28:44,333
Don't say relative.
Don't say relative.

526
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:46,500
Fellow traveler?

527
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,100
A fellow traveler?

528
00:28:49,967 --> 00:28:51,100
Fellow traveler.

529
00:28:51,233 --> 00:28:53,633
Well, um, fellow traveler,

530
00:28:53,767 --> 00:28:56,633
seeing how
we are out all this way,

531
00:28:56,767 --> 00:28:58,066
can I show you something?

532
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,433
Sure.

533
00:29:12,433 --> 00:29:14,800
Taylor: Beautiful.
Luke: Yeah.

534
00:29:17,834 --> 00:29:19,867
Listen, I just wanna
say that I know that

535
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,533
this time of year
isn't easy for you,

536
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,633
but I think you have this...

537
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,533
This perfect way
of capturing it all.

538
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,400
Do I?

539
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:33,266
I guess I'm good
at faking it then.

540
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,567
Come on.

541
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,533
Nobody's that good at faking it.

542
00:29:36,667 --> 00:29:41,033
Well, I mean,
I can see it, and hear it,

543
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:45,000
and smell that Christmas
spirit all around me, I just...

544
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:50,200
I don't know,
I can't seem to feel it anymore.

545
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,567
It's like my heart's
been walled-off.

546
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,734
Lower your window.

547
00:29:58,867 --> 00:29:59,967
What?

548
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,734
Just roll down your window.

549
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,467
Okay.

550
00:30:05,533 --> 00:30:06,967
Close your eyes.

551
00:30:08,066 --> 00:30:09,200
Close my...

552
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,400
Close your eyes.
Okay.

553
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,567
What do you hear?

554
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,767
I don't hear anything.

555
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,220
I just hear
the snow on the truck.

556
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:25,300
Exactly.

557
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:31,133
You know, whenever I feel
the world is just too big

558
00:30:31,266 --> 00:30:33,400
or too noisy,
I like to come up here.

559
00:30:35,233 --> 00:30:37,200
Just leave it all behind,
and just...

560
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:42,433
just listen to
that silent snowfall.

561
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:45,066
I think that if you can learn to

562
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,834
appreciate that stillness...

563
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:51,507
you'll find
that your heart's not as...

564
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,800
as walled-off
as you think it is.

565
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,834
There's a poetry to you,
Luke Malone.

566
00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:10,800
Well, I think that's just
you rubbing off on me.

567
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:14,133
Maybe a little.

568
00:31:30,934 --> 00:31:32,133
Dad.

569
00:31:32,266 --> 00:31:33,467
Luke!

570
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,500
You got those lights?

571
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:36,967
What on earth took you so long?

572
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,066
I was about to
send out a search party.

573
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:43,433
Well, hello there,

574
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:44,887
I'm Charlie Malone,
Luke's father.

575
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,767
Taylor Nichols.
Wonderful to meet you.

576
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,767
Taylor, Taylor.

577
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,100
I remember Frank Tabor
at the hardware store

578
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:52,833
once mentioned that
he had a grand-daughter

579
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:54,433
by the name of Taylor.

580
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,399
Wow, Dad, you... you really
know everyone in this town.

581
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,533
What can I say?

582
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,300
I was a captive audience.

583
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:02,200
I must have spent 15 minutes
hearing all about his genius

584
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,767
granddaughter while I was
there buying a screwdriver!

585
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,100
Yeah, that's my Grandpa.

586
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:10,367
Mom, um, this is Taylor.

587
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,100
Taylor, this is my mom Peggy.

588
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,367
Hi, nice to meet you.

589
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,000
Oh, you too, Taylor.

590
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,767
You have your hands full, Peggy,
how can I help you?

591
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,066
Well, if you could take
the bag of lights there,

592
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,333
um, and follow me,
and we'll put you to work.

593
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,533
Hey, Luke.

594
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,166
She, um, she seems nice.

595
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,233
Yeah, yeah.

596
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,667
Yeah, there's something
about her, I just...

597
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,133
I can't put it into words.

598
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,000
Um...

599
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:42,800
This arrived
while you were gone.

600
00:32:46,333 --> 00:32:48,734
Oh, uh...

601
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,100
Thanks.

602
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,133
She's quite lovely.

603
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:07,600
I am so happy for you.

604
00:33:07,734 --> 00:33:09,600
Yeah, well,
don't get too excited, Mom.

605
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:11,254
We haven't even had
our first date yet.

606
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,500
Oh, your father told me
about the letter.

607
00:33:14,633 --> 00:33:15,900
What did it say?

608
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,567
I'm in charge of
winter mountain training.

609
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:23,299
Yeah, I'll be
training troops from

610
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:25,667
over half a dozen countries.

611
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,100
It's in Eastern Europe.

612
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:30,266
Eastern Europe!
Luke, I am so proud of you.

613
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,600
Yeah.

614
00:33:33,266 --> 00:33:35,300
So, what do you think?
This one looks good?

615
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:39,233
But I'm gathering you wish
the timing was a little better.

616
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,333
Well, how do you say,
"Hey, Taylor,

617
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,433
I know we don't know
each other that well,

618
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:49,300
but I think we're
meant to be together,

619
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:51,233
oh, by the way,
we just need to wait

620
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,667
a whole year to find out."

621
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,300
Just like that, son.

622
00:33:56,433 --> 00:33:58,100
And if the feeling is mutual,

623
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:01,166
you'll have to let her
decide on her own.

624
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,567
Whatever the future might
hold for the two of you,

625
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,500
Taylor should know what it
means to be with a soldier.

626
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:13,887
Oh, and it looks like
they're about to light the tree!

627
00:34:20,467 --> 00:34:21,700
You guys ready?

628
00:34:21,834 --> 00:34:23,300
Oh, yes, please.

629
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:24,734
Alright.

630
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,633
Well, on second thought,

631
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:28,900
Taylor, why don't you
do the honours this year?

632
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:30,166
Okay.

633
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,834
One, two...

634
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,900
Three.

635
00:34:52,433 --> 00:34:53,533
Merry Christmas.

636
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:55,734
Merry Christmas, honey.

637
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,467
Merry Christmas!

638
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,633
Merry Christmas.

639
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:40,200
Hey.

640
00:35:41,834 --> 00:35:43,200
Everything okay?

641
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:49,500
You wanna take a walk with me?

642
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,834
Sure.

643
00:36:12,166 --> 00:36:14,033
Taylor: Are you okay?

644
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:15,400
Luke: Yeah.

645
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:18,734
When I was a kid,

646
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,767
I was frustrated about
my dad leaving, I'd...

647
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,333
I'd come up here.

648
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:25,567
Seems like a good spot to think.

649
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,567
Mostly I just yelled, actually.

650
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,767
Yeah, I've been
known to do that, too.

651
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,667
But back in the city
I usually have to

652
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,767
resort to the fire escape.

653
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,133
Taylor, I...

654
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,232
I might be reading
into this assuming that

655
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:43,033
you would even care, but...

656
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,934
I'm shipping out again.

657
00:36:48,066 --> 00:36:50,000
Just after Christmas.

658
00:36:50,133 --> 00:36:51,734
I got my notice today.

659
00:36:51,867 --> 00:36:53,300
Oh.

660
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:55,734
Where are you going?

661
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,166
Eastern Europe.

662
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,233
Eastern Europe?

663
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:01,333
Wow, that's great!

664
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:03,967
Yeah, no. No, it is great.

665
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,600
I'm helping train a squadron of
multinational recruits.

666
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:08,200
It's pretty remote.

667
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,333
How remote?

668
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:14,333
Well, let's put it this way,

669
00:37:14,467 --> 00:37:16,632
if you have a letter you'd like
to get to the real Santa Claus,

670
00:37:16,633 --> 00:37:18,133
I'd be happy to pass it along.

671
00:37:18,266 --> 00:37:20,333
Got it.

672
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:23,867
So, how long will you be gone?

673
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,533
A year.

674
00:37:29,934 --> 00:37:31,100
When do you leave?

675
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:33,767
In a week.

676
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,467
A week.

677
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,767
That's soon.

678
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,567
Yeah, I know,
I know. I wish...

679
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,033
I wish we had more
time to spend together.

680
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:48,900
But you'll still be back
for visits though, right?

681
00:37:49,033 --> 00:37:51,667
Weekend furloughs?
That sort of thing?

682
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,600
It's doubtful.

683
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:58,300
We're helicoptered in.
Satellite communications.

684
00:37:58,433 --> 00:38:00,233
It's survival training.

685
00:38:02,467 --> 00:38:05,734
So much for fellow travelers.

686
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:09,367
Listen, I put in for this

687
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,400
a while back, before...

688
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,467
you and I...

689
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,000
I like you, Taylor.

690
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:26,233
And listen, I know
this might sound crazy,

691
00:38:26,367 --> 00:38:29,066
but just talking to you,
it just feels...

692
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,000
Right?

693
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:32,800
Yeah.

694
00:38:32,934 --> 00:38:34,333
It feels right.

695
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,734
I know.

696
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:39,533
Is this kind of how it's
gonna be for us?

697
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:42,200
We just say goodbye

698
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:43,834
only to bump into
each other at some

699
00:38:43,967 --> 00:38:46,533
random destination somewhere?

700
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:49,734
Maybe this time
we don't say goodbye.

701
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,600
Maybe...

702
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,533
Maybe we try to make it work.

703
00:38:57,667 --> 00:39:00,900
We try to keep it going.

704
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:04,467
Write and email.

705
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,734
They have phones out there,
right?

706
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:10,033
A pretty good satellite system
from what I'm told,

707
00:39:10,166 --> 00:39:11,700
weather depending.

708
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:18,567
I don't know,
maybe we make the distance work.

709
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,133
Whatever it takes, right?

710
00:39:21,266 --> 00:39:23,033
That's what
the army's slogan is.

711
00:39:23,166 --> 00:39:25,367
Close, yeah.

712
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,500
I like you, too, Luke Malone.

713
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,567
You know, my mom, she used to
tell me the most important part

714
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,300
of Christmas is taking
the time to truly savour it.

715
00:39:44,066 --> 00:39:46,633
Because time is our
most precious gift of all.

716
00:39:46,767 --> 00:39:47,900
You know that.

717
00:39:48,033 --> 00:39:50,967
And what would your mom say

718
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,000
if she knew that we only
had a week together?

719
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:55,633
She'd say...

720
00:39:57,667 --> 00:39:59,567
"Enjoy it while it lasts."

721
00:40:43,667 --> 00:40:45,800
Taylor
As another Christmas approaches,

722
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:48,400
it's time once again
to pause for a moment

723
00:40:48,533 --> 00:40:49,633
in our day-to-day lives,

724
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:52,767
look forward to the year ahead,

725
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,900
and reflect on the one
we've left behind.

726
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:59,033
It's a time to remember
all the people we love,

727
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:02,834
the people we loved,
the people above,

728
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:05,800
the familiar faces
missing from our table,

729
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:09,500
and the welcomed guests
who just weren't able.

730
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,200
Hi!

731
00:41:11,333 --> 00:41:14,600
I think fondly of my friend,
Annie Grantham,

732
00:41:14,734 --> 00:41:16,100
busy knitting ornaments,

733
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:18,367
her heart out there to show.

734
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,767
And my good friends,
Peg and Charlie,

735
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:23,000
arranging gift baskets to go.

736
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:25,200
Sorry, to be continued.

737
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:26,399
Hi!

738
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,867
Oh, hey, Luke. How's it going?

739
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,300
I think of all the moms we miss,

740
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:34,767
the doting fathers
we can't kiss,

741
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,834
the siblings we can't hug hello,

742
00:41:37,967 --> 00:41:41,467
and the soldiers
who aren't coming home.

743
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,333
So, when you make your
Christmas list this year,

744
00:41:44,467 --> 00:41:48,667
remember all those people
who you never got to thank.

745
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,934
When you make your
Christmas list this year,

746
00:41:51,066 --> 00:41:54,467
remember to leave
one side blank.

747
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:00,700
So, thoughts?

748
00:42:00,834 --> 00:42:02,500
I think it's a little sad,

749
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:05,433
but I mean, that's the thing
about the holidays,

750
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,166
you're enjoying what's there,
but you're also...

751
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,867
You're also aware
of what's missing.

752
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,600
It's not too sentimental?

753
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:15,433
Oh, if anything I thought
it was a little moving.

754
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,200
Well, I didn't see you cry.

755
00:42:17,333 --> 00:42:19,533
In front of these guys?

756
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:22,233
Come on,
it would be the end of me.

757
00:42:22,367 --> 00:42:23,700
He's lying to you, Taylor!

758
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,332
He cried when he read
your piece out loud.

759
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,166
Oh, you read it out loud?

760
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,333
To the whole squad. Twice.

761
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:32,166
Twice, okay.
Well, thank you, Adam,

762
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:35,066
for your honesty.
I appreciate it.

763
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,867
He misses you, Taylor!

764
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,366
You're all he talks about
besides Monday night football!

765
00:42:38,367 --> 00:42:40,734
Okay, bye!

766
00:42:40,867 --> 00:42:43,033
So.

767
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:46,033
About the promotion.

768
00:42:46,166 --> 00:42:48,767
I have my meeting with Barb
first thing this morning.

769
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,767
Fingers crossed.

770
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:53,100
Sweetie, you've got nothing
to be nervous about.

771
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:55,600
You worked hard for this.

772
00:42:55,734 --> 00:42:57,166
It's almost lights-out here,

773
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:00,166
so you let me know just
as soon as you can, okay?

774
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:03,200
Taylor, um...

775
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:05,667
Taylor?

776
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:07,333
Luke? Can you hear me?

777
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:10,133
Tay... It's...

778
00:43:10,266 --> 00:43:12,032
It's okay, it's just a storm
front moving through.

779
00:43:12,033 --> 00:43:13,132
It's nothing to worry about.

780
00:43:13,133 --> 00:43:15,233
Luke, I...

781
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:17,066
I think you're breaking up.

782
00:43:19,367 --> 00:43:21,333
Taylor, I love you.

783
00:43:21,467 --> 00:43:23,934
I love you...

784
00:43:24,066 --> 00:43:25,266
too.

785
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,900
Barb:
Oh, this is great. Thank you.

786
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:37,467
Excellent.

787
00:43:38,633 --> 00:43:40,433
Oh.

788
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:43,567
You wanted to see me, Barb?

789
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:46,567
Yeah. Come in, Taylor.

790
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,734
First I want you to know that
I could not be happier with

791
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:52,233
the work you've done here
over the past two years.

792
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:53,567
Thank you.

793
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:56,633
But I also sense
that you may feel a bit

794
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,500
stalled in your career?

795
00:43:58,633 --> 00:44:01,767
Stalled? No.
No, I love working here.

796
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,066
And I love having you here,

797
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,367
which is why I am offering
you the position of

798
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,433
Associate Editor for
our Features Department.

799
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,433
Editor?
Associate Editor.

800
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:16,734
You'd help find
and assign stories,

801
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:18,600
get first reads of copy,

802
00:44:18,734 --> 00:44:21,100
keep a close eye on the budget,

803
00:44:21,233 --> 00:44:23,900
as well as continuing
to write your own stories.

804
00:44:24,033 --> 00:44:26,033
Barb, I...
In other words,

805
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:29,400
a lot more work
for not a lot more money.

806
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,633
Interested?
Yes. Yes!

807
00:44:33,767 --> 00:44:36,433
Good! Now...

808
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,467
have a merry little Christmas,

809
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,433
and be ready in the new year
to hit the ground running.

810
00:44:42,567 --> 00:44:44,333
I will. Thank you.

811
00:44:52,533 --> 00:44:54,000
Thank you.

812
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:57,400
Here you go.

813
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,633
So? What's the big news?

814
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:04,934
Well, you are looking
at the next editor.

815
00:45:05,066 --> 00:45:06,166
Editor?!

816
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,266
Well, associate editor, but...

817
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,533
Congratulations!
That is fantastic.

818
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,800
What did Luke say?

819
00:45:12,934 --> 00:45:14,300
Uh...

820
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:15,633
Yeah, I messaged him.

821
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:18,300
It takes a while
to go through, so...

822
00:45:18,433 --> 00:45:20,300
I'm sure he'll be jubilant.

823
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:22,333
Luke's still coming
home for the holidays?

824
00:45:22,467 --> 00:45:26,000
After one whole year apart.

825
00:45:26,133 --> 00:45:28,100
Wow, you must be so excited.

826
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,600
And a little nervous.

827
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:33,033
Why? You guys seem perfect.

828
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,533
Everything feels perfect,

829
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,500
I can talk to
him about anything.

830
00:45:37,633 --> 00:45:39,633
My hopes, my fears.

831
00:45:39,767 --> 00:45:43,700
Somehow, even from
thousands of miles away,

832
00:45:43,834 --> 00:45:47,033
he makes me feel so safe.

833
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:49,533
Like a warm, cozy blanket.

834
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:52,200
Like a warm, ruggedly handsome,

835
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,500
tough as nails, cozy blanket?

836
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:55,934
Yes, all of that.

837
00:45:57,900 --> 00:45:59,433
I love him.

838
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,333
And he loves me, and...

839
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,767
It's magic.

840
00:46:08,467 --> 00:46:10,633
It feels like
we're living a dream.

841
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:16,100
But what if that's all it is?

842
00:46:16,233 --> 00:46:20,166
We've spent 99 percent of our
relationship long distance.

843
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,000
We've managed to make it fun,

844
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:26,767
but this thing is
no substitute for...

845
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,266
Physicality.

846
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,500
Okay, well, that is
an issue of proximity.

847
00:46:32,633 --> 00:46:34,500
But I was going to say...

848
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,900
it's no substitute
for the real thing.

849
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:40,433
Don't second-guess it.

850
00:46:40,567 --> 00:46:42,600
Hey.

851
00:46:42,734 --> 00:46:44,500
I know, without any doubt,

852
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:47,567
that my best friend is
in love with an awesome guy.

853
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,000
It's written all over your face.

854
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:52,734
I am.

855
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:54,800
I am madly in love with him.

856
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:04,133
Bad news, brother.

857
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:06,100
What's the matter?

858
00:47:06,233 --> 00:47:08,400
There's a heavy
storm front moving in.

859
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:09,967
They've grounded
all flights out.

860
00:47:10,100 --> 00:47:11,667
We're lucky we still
have comms for now.

861
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:14,900
Until it clears,
none of us are going anywhere.

862
00:47:15,033 --> 00:47:16,265
Well, there was supposed
to be enough time.

863
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,400
What is this? A bad joke?

864
00:47:17,533 --> 00:47:18,667
I wish I was joking.

865
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,160
Base says it's not
safe to fly out.

866
00:47:20,266 --> 00:47:22,567
Adam, I need to get home.

867
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,834
Okay? I made plans to...

868
00:47:23,967 --> 00:47:25,467
Sorry, brother.

869
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,934
I know how much you were
looking forward to going home,

870
00:47:28,066 --> 00:47:29,066
but it ain't happening.

871
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:40,300
Merry Christmas, John,

872
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:42,400
and thanks again
for stopping by.

873
00:47:44,033 --> 00:47:45,899
This is a really great
thing you're doing here.

874
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:47,400
Ah, we're just
doing what we can.

875
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:55,934
Excuse me, ma'am.

876
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:57,400
Is Captain Malone here?

877
00:47:57,533 --> 00:48:00,133
No, sorry he's not.

878
00:48:00,266 --> 00:48:03,233
We're actually not sure if
he's coming home right now.

879
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:07,567
There's a bad storm and no
flights are getting out, so.

880
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,066
Oh. I'm so sorry to hear that.

881
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,834
Yeah.

882
00:48:10,967 --> 00:48:13,133
Can I pass anything on
when I speak to him?

883
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,066
I just wanted to thank him.

884
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:16,533
Thank him?

885
00:48:16,667 --> 00:48:18,500
Captain Malone,
he's been helping me out with

886
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:20,700
a few things,
getting me back on my feet.

887
00:48:20,834 --> 00:48:22,233
He helped me find my last job,

888
00:48:22,367 --> 00:48:24,133
but the contract just finished,

889
00:48:24,266 --> 00:48:25,999
so I was going to see
if he had anything else.

890
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,734
You know, I might have an idea.

891
00:48:30,333 --> 00:48:31,633
It doesn't pay all that well,

892
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:34,533
but it could be a good fit.

893
00:48:34,667 --> 00:48:36,166
Really?

894
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:38,166
Thanks!

895
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,066
And thanks for doing all this.

896
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,633
It matters.

897
00:48:43,867 --> 00:48:45,633
Of course.

898
00:48:45,767 --> 00:48:48,900
And any friend of Luke's
is a friend of mine.

899
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:50,633
Merry Christmas.

900
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:11,533
I wondered where you got to.

901
00:49:13,166 --> 00:49:14,633
I was just checking.

902
00:49:14,767 --> 00:49:16,000
Ah, still no word?

903
00:49:18,600 --> 00:49:20,867
No.

904
00:49:25,533 --> 00:49:27,767
You know, it's really wonderful

905
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,867
what you do here
for so many people.

906
00:49:32,233 --> 00:49:36,100
After I lost my mom,
I didn't understand any of this.

907
00:49:36,233 --> 00:49:38,900
You know, I could talk about it,
I could even write about it,

908
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:42,467
but Christmas,
that was for everyone else.

909
00:49:44,266 --> 00:49:47,367
No matter how hard I tried,
I didn't know how to celebrate.

910
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:51,467
And now that I'm beginning
to understand...

911
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:58,600
the one person who showed me
what all of this means,

912
00:49:58,734 --> 00:50:00,900
and what I've been missing,

913
00:50:01,033 --> 00:50:05,433
he's the one person
I can't be with at Christmas,

914
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:06,734
and I don't know what to do.

915
00:50:06,867 --> 00:50:09,600
Oh, Taylor.
You will find your way.

916
00:50:09,734 --> 00:50:11,567
I know you will.

917
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:13,233
Come here, come here.

918
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,300
Luke? Is everything alright?

919
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,567
It's perfect.

920
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:21,800
Hey, Dad, I'm just calling

921
00:50:21,934 --> 00:50:23,199
because I need your help
with something.

922
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,767
Alright, son, name it.

923
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:26,232
I need you to go in
my old room and get something

924
00:50:26,233 --> 00:50:27,367
out of the dresser.

925
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,233
Okay.

926
00:50:29,367 --> 00:50:31,767
Okay, and I need
one more favour tonight.

927
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:34,967
I'm all ears.
Here's the plan.

928
00:50:50,567 --> 00:50:53,467
Taylor, honey, you've done
enough work for tonight.

929
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,667
Come, join us at the fireplace.

930
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:08,834
Luke?

931
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:11,367
Taylor? Can you hear me?

932
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,266
Yes, I can hear you.
I can hear you, Luke!

933
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:14,700
Merry Christmas!

934
00:51:14,834 --> 00:51:16,100
Luke: Merry Christmas.

935
00:51:16,233 --> 00:51:17,867
Listen, I'm sorry
I can't be there.

936
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,667
It's... Well, it's looking
more certain I'm not going to

937
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,100
make it home at all this year.

938
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,367
Still, I, uh...

939
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:26,934
I wanted to get you something.

940
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,866
Are you going to get
your whole squad to sing me

941
00:51:28,867 --> 00:51:30,433
"Silent Night" again?

942
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:34,133
Well, nothing that extravagant.

943
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,000
Just a simple question.

944
00:51:41,667 --> 00:51:43,934
Look, I really wanted to
do this in person,

945
00:51:44,066 --> 00:51:46,033
but...

946
00:51:46,166 --> 00:51:48,066
I guess this is
just going to have to do.

947
00:51:50,567 --> 00:51:51,967
Taylor...

948
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,934
from the first
moment that I met you,

949
00:51:56,066 --> 00:51:59,033
all I wanted was a life
beside you.

950
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:02,100
Will you do me the honour
of becoming my wife?

951
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,367
Will you marry me?

952
00:52:13,533 --> 00:52:16,667
Luke called me about a month ago
to ask for my blessing,

953
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:17,934
and I said yes.

954
00:52:18,066 --> 00:52:19,266
Grandpa.

955
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:31,333
Yes, Luke, I'll marry you!

956
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:34,166
Yes? You said yes?

957
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,600
I said yes.
Luke, I'll marry you.

958
00:52:37,734 --> 00:52:40,633
She said yes! Taylor?

959
00:52:40,767 --> 00:52:42,100
Luke, Luke!

960
00:52:42,233 --> 00:52:45,166
Taylor, you're breaking up.

961
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,367
The communications... Taylor?

962
00:52:54,433 --> 00:52:55,600
It's okay.

963
00:52:55,734 --> 00:52:56,834
Yeah.

964
00:52:56,967 --> 00:52:58,900
Oh, it's beautiful.

965
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:00,633
I'm so happy. Congratulations.

966
00:53:00,767 --> 00:53:01,867
Thank you.

967
00:53:03,333 --> 00:53:04,767
Thanks, Grandpa.

968
00:53:06,133 --> 00:53:07,633
What's going on?
Can we get them back?

969
00:53:07,767 --> 00:53:09,533
Comms seem to be
down all over base.

970
00:53:09,667 --> 00:53:11,633
It could be an issue
with the satellite.

971
00:53:11,767 --> 00:53:13,967
Alright, I'm gonna go
check for myself.

972
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,766
You're not thinking of
going out there alone, are you?

973
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:17,247
I know the terrain
better than anyone.

974
00:53:17,367 --> 00:53:19,165
And what's your experience
with repairing advanced

975
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:21,200
radio communications systems?

976
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:22,633
It's passable.

977
00:53:22,767 --> 00:53:24,166
I'm coming with you.

978
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,300
Arm yourself, we'll be
close to enemy territory.

979
00:53:33,333 --> 00:53:35,867
Adam: How are the wedding
plans coming along?

980
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,400
Funny.

981
00:53:37,533 --> 00:53:39,367
Well, you've been
engaged all of 30 minutes.

982
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,400
I figured you already
have it all planned out.

983
00:53:41,533 --> 00:53:43,499
Honestly, I'm just running
with my own intuition

984
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,900
on this one, brother.

985
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:46,332
You know it's not
going to be the same in

986
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:48,000
these snowy mountains
without you.

987
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:49,999
Oh, come on, you know I'm going
to miss the freezing nights,

988
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,734
the no internet, those MREs.

989
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:53,033
Good times!

990
00:53:53,166 --> 00:53:54,967
You'll be having a good time.

991
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,467
Training those newbies on
Christmas while I'm at home,

992
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:59,233
warm and cozy with my bride.

993
00:53:59,367 --> 00:54:00,967
Couldn't have
happened to a nicer guy.

994
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,100
I'm just sorry I can't be there.

995
00:54:03,233 --> 00:54:04,533
I'd better be there.

996
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:06,700
I've known you
a long time, Luke.

997
00:54:06,834 --> 00:54:08,499
I've seen you walk
into situations that would

998
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,967
have an average man buckle,

999
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:11,934
but I've never seen you
so sure about anything

1000
00:54:12,066 --> 00:54:13,600
than you are about Taylor.

1001
00:54:13,734 --> 00:54:15,533
I'd trust in your intuition.

1002
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:17,033
There it is.

1003
00:54:24,266 --> 00:54:25,700
I gotta perform a reset.

1004
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:30,900
You hear that?

1005
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:33,800
I definitely heard something.

1006
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:35,199
Probably one of
Santa's reindeer.

1007
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,734
Come on. Let's head back.

1008
00:54:39,233 --> 00:54:41,393
Come on, you're not getting
cold feet already, are you?

1009
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:43,967
Everything's cold.

1010
00:54:55,567 --> 00:54:57,767
I know it doesn't
help right now,

1011
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,100
but this isn't the first
time I've ever lost touch

1012
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:01,667
with one of my guys.

1013
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:05,033
I once didn't hear from
Charlie for over a week.

1014
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:08,467
Wow. That must've been awful.

1015
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:10,567
Longest week of my life.

1016
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,633
Sometimes I feel
like I miss Luke,

1017
00:55:14,767 --> 00:55:16,567
even when we do talk.

1018
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:19,433
He can get so quiet.

1019
00:55:20,967 --> 00:55:23,333
He doesn't want to
talk about what he's doing

1020
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:25,033
or how he's doing.

1021
00:55:25,166 --> 00:55:27,767
No, he wants to talk
about the Christmas Festival,

1022
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,600
or what's happening
at the store.

1023
00:55:30,734 --> 00:55:34,100
Or which carols the choir is
gonna sing for Christmas dinner.

1024
00:55:34,233 --> 00:55:36,200
All the little things.

1025
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:38,633
Yeah.

1026
00:55:38,767 --> 00:55:42,333
When a soldier's away
from the ones they love,

1027
00:55:42,467 --> 00:55:46,266
they miss home more
than anyone can imagine.

1028
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,700
So, hearing about
those little things,

1029
00:55:49,834 --> 00:55:52,300
those things that don't
seem important to us,

1030
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:55,066
that's something
they can hang on to.

1031
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,967
Especially at Christmas.

1032
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:06,433
So, hearing about
the lights and the music,

1033
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:08,533
he feels a little less alone.

1034
00:56:08,667 --> 00:56:10,934
Exactly.

1035
00:56:11,066 --> 00:56:12,200
Frank: Well, I'll be.

1036
00:56:12,333 --> 00:56:13,867
Look who's back!

1037
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,400
Oh!

1038
00:56:15,533 --> 00:56:17,233
Can you guys hear me?

1039
00:56:17,367 --> 00:56:19,567
We hear you
loud and clear, Luke!

1040
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:20,834
Taylor?

1041
00:56:20,967 --> 00:56:22,767
I'm here, Luke.

1042
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,833
Listen, I'm so sorry about
all the communication problems,

1043
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:26,166
but I think
we got it sorted out.

1044
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:33,200
Now, looks like
we have a wedding to plan!

1045
00:56:35,133 --> 00:56:36,333
That we do.

1046
00:56:36,467 --> 00:56:37,667
Yes.

1047
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,333
Taylor, you're still here?
I thought you already

1048
00:56:55,467 --> 00:56:57,400
turned in your last story
before the big day.

1049
00:56:57,533 --> 00:57:00,233
I'm working on
something else, actually.

1050
00:57:00,367 --> 00:57:02,533
Luke and I decided
to write our own vows,

1051
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:06,233
and let's just say the words
aren't exactly flowing.

1052
00:57:06,367 --> 00:57:08,007
Maybe I can help.
What do you have so far?

1053
00:57:11,033 --> 00:57:12,667
"Dear Luke."

1054
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,133
That's it?

1055
00:57:15,266 --> 00:57:16,533
Uh-huh.

1056
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,567
Do wedding vows
typically start with "dear?"

1057
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:21,467
It kinda sounds like
you're breaking up.

1058
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:26,066
I've managed to write two words
and one of them is so wrong.

1059
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,133
Well, don't overthink it
too much, Taylor.

1060
00:57:28,266 --> 00:57:30,367
Share what's in
your heart that day.

1061
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:32,834
Now I'm off to Honolulu!

1062
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,867
Make sure you lock up,

1063
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,800
and remember to have some fun!

1064
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:39,333
Merry Christmas.

1065
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:43,834
Yeah, I'm just about ready.

1066
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,834
Bonnie's helping me pack.

1067
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:49,400
Hey, Luke!
Hi, Bonnie.

1068
00:57:49,533 --> 00:57:51,366
She's gonna be my maid of honor,
did I mention that?

1069
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:53,333
I mentioned that.

1070
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:57,200
How about you? Everything okay?

1071
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:59,867
Yeah, no, it looks like Adam's
pretty sure he's gonna be able

1072
00:58:00,066 --> 00:58:01,467
to make it as my best man,

1073
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,899
and the weather's
looking perfect for flying.

1074
00:58:02,900 --> 00:58:05,633
So, I'll see you soon.

1075
00:58:05,767 --> 00:58:07,633
I just can't wait to see you.

1076
00:58:09,433 --> 00:58:11,734
That sounds so lame.

1077
00:58:11,867 --> 00:58:13,633
It just doesn't convey

1078
00:58:13,767 --> 00:58:16,367
the gravity of
an entire year apart.

1079
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,867
Well, only a few more days now.

1080
00:58:20,734 --> 00:58:21,867
I love you.

1081
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,367
I love you, too.

1082
00:58:28,233 --> 00:58:30,734
Bye.
Bye.

1083
00:58:39,033 --> 00:58:40,867
So? You all set?

1084
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,433
We have a wedding to finalize!

1085
00:58:44,233 --> 00:58:45,367
Let's do this.

1086
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,100
Bonnie: Let's do this!

1087
00:58:51,066 --> 00:58:52,767
Taylor: This is the shop here.

1088
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,033
It's cute, right?

1089
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,533
Bonnie:
It's so cute. Oh, my gosh!

1090
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,800
Grandpa, we're here!

1091
00:58:58,934 --> 00:59:00,133
Nathan: Oh.

1092
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:02,100
Oh, Nathan! Hi.

1093
00:59:02,233 --> 00:59:03,265
Hey!

1094
00:59:03,266 --> 00:59:04,367
It's so good to see you!

1095
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:05,860
Nathan, this is
my friend, Bonnie.

1096
00:59:05,967 --> 00:59:07,467
Bonnie, Nathan.

1097
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,800
Nice to meet you, Nathan.
Merry Christmas!

1098
00:59:09,934 --> 00:59:12,000
You, too. Merry Christmas.

1099
00:59:12,133 --> 00:59:15,667
Taylor!
You two are finally here!

1100
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,667
Hi, Grandpa.

1101
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:19,533
Grandpa, this is
my friend Bonnie.

1102
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:21,867
Great to meet you, Bonnie.
So glad you could be here.

1103
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,166
Are you kidding me?

1104
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,800
I wouldn't miss
this for the world.

1105
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,300
I adore Christmas weddings!

1106
00:59:26,433 --> 00:59:28,667
They're like a soap opera
in a snow globe!

1107
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,599
Speaking of snow globes.
Do you sell any here?

1108
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,133
I promised my mom
I'd bring back a souvenir.

1109
00:59:33,266 --> 00:59:34,667
Nathan, would you mind?

1110
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:35,934
Yeah, right over here.

1111
00:59:36,066 --> 00:59:37,467
Oh, amazing.

1112
00:59:40,967 --> 00:59:43,200
So, how are things
working out with Nathan?

1113
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:44,867
Oh, it's working great.

1114
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:49,266
I had no idea how much
I needed the help around here.

1115
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,533
We could all use a little
help every now and then.

1116
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:54,187
Sometimes we're lucky enough to
be in the position to give some.

1117
00:59:55,834 --> 00:59:57,767
How are the wedding
preparations coming along?

1118
00:59:59,166 --> 01:00:02,133
We're getting there,
inch by inch.

1119
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:04,667
I don't know what I would do
without Bonnie's help,

1120
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:06,533
and Peg and Charlie, and you.

1121
01:00:06,667 --> 01:00:08,433
Speaking of that,

1122
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:10,500
I am late for my dress fitting.

1123
01:00:10,633 --> 01:00:11,867
Bonnie?

1124
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:17,533
Okay.
I found the perfect one.

1125
01:00:17,667 --> 01:00:20,066
It's beautiful,
and it's a wedding cake.

1126
01:00:24,633 --> 01:00:26,767
Ah! Just wait one more minute.

1127
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,834
You'll ruin your appetite.

1128
01:00:28,967 --> 01:00:30,633
Impossible.

1129
01:00:30,767 --> 01:00:32,633
Ah, you.

1130
01:00:32,767 --> 01:00:35,500
Are you ready?
Mm-hmm.

1131
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,767
Taylor:
Okay, guys. I think I'm ready.

1132
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,333
Let me know if
I've got this hemline right.

1133
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,600
Oh...

1134
01:00:46,066 --> 01:00:48,467
So? What do you think?

1135
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,299
I think it might be bunching
a little bit at the back.

1136
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:52,500
You look...
Beautiful.

1137
01:00:52,633 --> 01:00:54,066
Like an angel.

1138
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,433
Oh, Charlie, are you crying?

1139
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:01,000
Uh, it's just
that mistletoe allergy of mine.

1140
01:01:03,967 --> 01:01:05,066
Bonnie:
It's perfect.

1141
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:09,667
Perfect.

1142
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:16,333
Okay. Now that we've finalized
the guest list,

1143
01:01:16,467 --> 01:01:18,500
I'll e-mail that to the caterer.

1144
01:01:18,633 --> 01:01:20,734
And the photographer said
she finally found someone

1145
01:01:20,867 --> 01:01:23,066
to assist with the video.

1146
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:25,033
Do you think two cameras
is enough?

1147
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:26,734
I was thinking,
what about a drone?

1148
01:01:26,867 --> 01:01:28,667
A couple of nice aerial shots.

1149
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:31,834
You know, I saw in this magazine
they had this crazy high shot.

1150
01:01:31,967 --> 01:01:35,100
Two cameras are plenty,
Ms. Spielberg.

1151
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,700
Okay. Florist has the order
for the bouquet.

1152
01:01:37,834 --> 01:01:39,000
Mm-hmm.

1153
01:01:39,133 --> 01:01:40,700
Poinsettias for
the table settings.

1154
01:01:40,834 --> 01:01:43,867
You don't think they're too,
I don't know, traditional?

1155
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:46,700
No. It's a Christmas wedding.
Poinsettias are mandatory.

1156
01:01:46,834 --> 01:01:50,166
Well, then the decision is made.

1157
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,767
Chapel, music, minister,

1158
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,567
final dress fitting.

1159
01:01:54,700 --> 01:01:56,620
Oh, and I can't make
any promises, but right now,

1160
01:01:56,734 --> 01:01:59,400
the weather forecast
is calling for light snow.

1161
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:01,599
Hopefully just as we're
coming out after the ceremony,

1162
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,400
for that cinematic effect.

1163
01:02:06,066 --> 01:02:08,567
We're in the home
stretch, Taylor.

1164
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:10,400
Everything else
is in the details.

1165
01:02:10,533 --> 01:02:11,967
I know.

1166
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:14,066
All we're missing now
is the groom.

1167
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:19,233
I'm so sorry.
That totally came out wrong.

1168
01:02:19,367 --> 01:02:21,633
Bonnie, it's okay.

1169
01:02:21,767 --> 01:02:23,100
I know he'll be here.

1170
01:02:23,233 --> 01:02:27,000
This time,
luck will be on our side.

1171
01:02:27,133 --> 01:02:28,600
I can feel it.

1172
01:02:34,567 --> 01:02:36,934
Thank you so much, Peggy,
for all your help.

1173
01:02:37,066 --> 01:02:38,567
I really appreciate it.

1174
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,500
You're family. Of course.

1175
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:50,333
Luke?

1176
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:54,367
Hi, Taylor.

1177
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,000
You're... you're here.

1178
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:02,300
You're early.

1179
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:04,300
Yeah. I thought I'd surprise you

1180
01:03:04,433 --> 01:03:05,800
with some good news
for a change.

1181
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,900
Charlie: So, there we were
at the tree farm,

1182
01:03:26,033 --> 01:03:28,467
all set to pick out
the perfect Christmas tree.

1183
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:31,567
Yes. And this little guy,
he's only three years old.

1184
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:33,200
It's his first time.

1185
01:03:33,333 --> 01:03:36,533
But he keeps on saying,
"Not this one. Not that one."

1186
01:03:36,667 --> 01:03:38,266
None of them were right.

1187
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,934
Okay, Mom. I don't think anybody
wants to hear this story.

1188
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:43,400
You don't want to hear
this story, right?

1189
01:03:43,533 --> 01:03:45,233
I think I do. Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

1190
01:03:45,367 --> 01:03:46,467
Hear, hear!

1191
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:48,734
So, we were walking around...

1192
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:50,633
And keep in mind,
this place goes on forever

1193
01:03:50,767 --> 01:03:52,867
and it was snowing
like the dickens.

1194
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:54,633
And you know what?

1195
01:03:54,767 --> 01:03:56,433
The daylight was running dry.

1196
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,800
And so finally,
Charlie says to Luke,

1197
01:03:58,934 --> 01:04:02,000
"Buddy, we're going to
freeze here. Give us a hint.

1198
01:04:02,133 --> 01:04:04,767
What exactly
are we looking for?"

1199
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,266
What did he say?

1200
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:09,266
Well, he said the trees
all looked too plain.

1201
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,133
He was looking for one
with decorations,

1202
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:14,133
like in the pictures.
Aww.

1203
01:04:14,266 --> 01:04:16,133
And ever since that day,
we've always let Luke

1204
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:17,967
pick out
the perfect Christmas tree.

1205
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,333
You still want to marry me?

1206
01:04:19,467 --> 01:04:21,100
Definitely.

1207
01:04:21,233 --> 01:04:22,700
Aw.

1208
01:04:22,834 --> 01:04:24,767
Okay. That calls for a cheers.

1209
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,533
Ah. Merry Christmas.

1210
01:04:26,667 --> 01:04:28,433
Merry Christmas.

1211
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:35,100
So, home two whole days early.

1212
01:04:35,233 --> 01:04:39,300
Well, that was Adam's idea,
actually, not to tell you.

1213
01:04:39,433 --> 01:04:41,133
He thought
that you would enjoy the...

1214
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:43,200
Oh, the shock? Yeah.

1215
01:04:43,333 --> 01:04:46,266
Actually, "surprise"
was the word he used.

1216
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,533
Okay. And how long
has Adam been married

1217
01:04:48,667 --> 01:04:50,900
or had a steady girlfriend?

1218
01:04:52,834 --> 01:04:54,300
You know,
now that you mention it,

1219
01:04:54,433 --> 01:04:55,633
he is a perpetual bachelor.

1220
01:04:55,767 --> 01:04:57,033
Hmm. Shocking.

1221
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,033
Oh. I, uh... Sorry, Taylor.
I just have to take this.

1222
01:05:05,166 --> 01:05:07,000
It's a call from command
at base.

1223
01:05:07,133 --> 01:05:08,367
Is everything okay?

1224
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,767
Yeah. No worries.

1225
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:12,632
Man on phone:
Captain, it's Colonel Murphy.

1226
01:05:12,633 --> 01:05:14,433
My apologies for the intrusion.

1227
01:05:14,567 --> 01:05:16,433
Luke:
That's all right, sir.

1228
01:05:16,567 --> 01:05:18,132
As you know, Captain Kerney
has been in charge

1229
01:05:18,133 --> 01:05:20,000
of the training mission
in your stead.

1230
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:21,667
Yes, sir.
Wait. Is everything okay?

1231
01:05:21,800 --> 01:05:23,600
Kerney's team was on
a training run

1232
01:05:23,734 --> 01:05:25,566
when their helicopter reported
engine trouble.

1233
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:27,300
They've been
out of contact ever since.

1234
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,500
Uh, how long ago was this?

1235
01:05:30,633 --> 01:05:32,000
Yesterday morning.

1236
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:33,499
Until we're sure,
we have to assume

1237
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:34,767
their helicopter went down.

1238
01:05:34,900 --> 01:05:37,100
Taylor, is something wrong?

1239
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:42,200
Luke just got a call

1240
01:05:42,333 --> 01:05:44,667
from base.
Oh.

1241
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:46,000
Well, you know, sir,

1242
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:47,466
communications
are tricky up there.

1243
01:05:47,467 --> 01:05:49,066
Maybe they're just not
getting through.

1244
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:50,833
We've already got a search
and rescue mission in the air.

1245
01:05:50,834 --> 01:05:52,567
Sir,

1246
01:05:52,700 --> 01:05:54,232
you're not going to see anything
from up there.

1247
01:05:54,233 --> 01:05:56,834
Not in that terrain.

1248
01:05:56,967 --> 01:05:58,867
And there's nowhere
to land, either.

1249
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,899
You're going to have to get
a team in there, sir.

1250
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:02,300
A team that knows that area.

1251
01:06:02,433 --> 01:06:04,132
Unfortunately,
there's a blizzard coming in,

1252
01:06:04,133 --> 01:06:05,633
and that window is closing.

1253
01:06:05,767 --> 01:06:07,366
Luke, I know you're home
right now, with your bride,

1254
01:06:07,367 --> 01:06:09,633
preparing for your wedding.

1255
01:06:09,767 --> 01:06:12,433
I won't order you to do this,

1256
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:14,333
but I know you're close
with Captain Kerney

1257
01:06:14,467 --> 01:06:16,900
and you'd want to be
kept informed.

1258
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:18,767
I understand. Thank you, sir.

1259
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,400
Is everything okay, son?

1260
01:06:32,800 --> 01:06:34,734
That was Colonel Murphy.

1261
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:36,934
What did he have to say?

1262
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:40,433
Uh, Adam and his team,
they were on a training mission,

1263
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:43,767
and, um, the helicopter
reported trouble

1264
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,900
and they've lost communication.
There's a blizzard coming in,

1265
01:06:47,033 --> 01:06:50,734
and it's going to cut them off
and force them to

1266
01:06:50,867 --> 01:06:53,200
make their way
down the mountain on foot.

1267
01:06:55,867 --> 01:06:57,500
Taylor, we need to talk.

1268
01:07:04,767 --> 01:07:06,734
Can they really do this?

1269
01:07:07,967 --> 01:07:10,367
Can they order you
to go like this?

1270
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,233
It wasn't an order, Taylor.

1271
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:17,166
It was my decision to make.

1272
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:19,300
The car is going to be here
in 30 minutes.

1273
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:24,667
Um...

1274
01:07:30,533 --> 01:07:33,900
My dad gave 25 years
of his life to the military

1275
01:07:34,033 --> 01:07:37,133
before he retired.
Did I ever tell you that?

1276
01:07:37,266 --> 01:07:39,400
No.

1277
01:07:39,533 --> 01:07:40,900
He was away a lot.

1278
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:47,000
Yeah.
He missed, uh, graduations,

1279
01:07:47,133 --> 01:07:48,800
countless birthdays,

1280
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:51,700
Christmas.

1281
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:55,200
I remember this one Christmas.
My mom was...

1282
01:07:55,333 --> 01:07:58,033
She was talking to my dad,
and she put me on with him.

1283
01:07:58,166 --> 01:07:59,467
And I...

1284
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:03,667
You know, I was so angry
I barely said two words.

1285
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:07,633
But I remember

1286
01:08:07,767 --> 01:08:11,967
hearing something in his voice

1287
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:14,633
that made me realize that...

1288
01:08:17,367 --> 01:08:19,900
It was harder for him
to be away for Christmas

1289
01:08:20,033 --> 01:08:22,233
than it was for me.

1290
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:26,700
It wasn't his choice to go. He...

1291
01:08:26,834 --> 01:08:28,300
He had to go.

1292
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:32,333
Because he's a soldier.

1293
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:35,367
Because it's his duty.

1294
01:08:40,934 --> 01:08:44,400
Taylor, you know,
we've lost so much time

1295
01:08:44,533 --> 01:08:46,633
already.

1296
01:08:46,767 --> 01:08:47,800
I...

1297
01:08:47,934 --> 01:08:49,934
Luke.

1298
01:08:50,066 --> 01:08:52,400
You have to do this.

1299
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:00,900
You won't make it back in time
for the wedding, will you?

1300
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:04,867
No.

1301
01:09:07,567 --> 01:09:09,133
So then, we wait.

1302
01:09:09,266 --> 01:09:12,600
We wait just a
little while longer.

1303
01:09:12,734 --> 01:09:16,867
I mean, if there's one thing
this past year has taught me,

1304
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,934
it's that some things
are worth the wait.

1305
01:09:24,934 --> 01:09:27,567
I just want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1306
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:31,500
And you will.

1307
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:33,433
As soon as you come back.

1308
01:09:36,266 --> 01:09:38,533
I love you, Luke.

1309
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:40,700
I love you.

1310
01:09:40,834 --> 01:09:44,233
Which is why I could never
ask you not to go.

1311
01:09:48,400 --> 01:09:50,400
Dance with me.

1312
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:53,300
What?

1313
01:09:57,333 --> 01:09:59,133
Dance with me.

1314
01:09:59,266 --> 01:10:00,700
Just here.

1315
01:10:02,066 --> 01:10:04,633

01:11:12,734 --> 01:11:15,934
here. You'll go on
foot from there.

1333
01:11:16,066 --> 01:11:18,099
You sure about this, soldier?
No one here would blame you

1334
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,266
for getting right back
on that plane.

1335
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:23,300
Adam would do the
same for me, sir.

1336
01:11:23,433 --> 01:11:25,734
We'll find them, Colonel.
You do that, Captain.

1337
01:11:25,867 --> 01:11:27,299
Then let's get you home
to your bride.

1338
01:11:27,300 --> 01:11:29,066
Chopper is standing by.
Thank you.

1339
01:11:37,967 --> 01:11:40,333
Could you pass me one of
those smelling salts, please?

1340
01:11:40,467 --> 01:11:42,400
Absolutely, Frank.
Thank you kindly, sir.

1341
01:11:42,533 --> 01:11:45,900
There we go.

1342
01:11:46,033 --> 01:11:49,300
Everything's going to be
just fine.

1343
01:11:49,433 --> 01:11:51,233
We'll be first to hear.

1344
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,400
I know.

1345
01:11:54,533 --> 01:11:56,900
You know, I'll be right back.

1346
01:12:39,266 --> 01:12:40,900
I've notified the caterer,
the florist,

1347
01:12:41,033 --> 01:12:43,033
the makeup artist
and the chapel rental.

1348
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:44,886
The good news is
Pastor Mandel is a veteran.

1349
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:47,467
So, and I quote,
"Whatever it takes."

1350
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,600
I'm still not exactly sure
what to tell the guests.

1351
01:12:50,667 --> 01:12:53,166
Oh, I'm so sorry, sweetie.

1352
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:54,967
I can't imagine
what you're going through,

1353
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:57,667
and here I am going on
about flower arrangements.

1354
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:00,967
Bonnie, it's okay.

1355
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,500
I really appreciate
everything you're doing.

1356
01:13:06,667 --> 01:13:08,533
Everyone's been so good.

1357
01:13:08,667 --> 01:13:10,533
Has there been any news at all?

1358
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:12,800
No.

1359
01:13:15,000 --> 01:13:16,900
Not since yesterday.

1360
01:13:30,100 --> 01:13:32,533
"The best gifts
don't have bows."

1361
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,133
Is that another
Charles Dickens quote?

1362
01:13:36,266 --> 01:13:37,767
Like "Bah, humbug"?

1363
01:13:37,900 --> 01:13:40,233
No, it's something Luke
said to me,

1364
01:13:40,367 --> 01:13:42,000
the night we first met.

1365
01:13:46,934 --> 01:13:51,767
If I'm going to have to accept
all of this uncertainty...

1366
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:56,367
then I'm going to have to
do it on my own terms.

1367
01:13:56,500 --> 01:14:01,400
I'm done waiting
and wishing and wondering.

1368
01:14:04,433 --> 01:14:06,600
Maybe sometimes,

1369
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:09,900
we have to make our
own Christmas wishes come true.

1370
01:14:12,166 --> 01:14:14,266
Taylor, are you okay, dear?

1371
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,667
Charlie:
I know it seems like worry

1372
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,467
is all we got right now,

1373
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,166
but I know Luke,
and I know the army.

1374
01:14:21,300 --> 01:14:22,467
We just have to have faith.

1375
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,300
You're right, Charlie.

1376
01:14:26,433 --> 01:14:27,867
And I know you and Peggy

1377
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:31,200
have been in this same spot
many times before,

1378
01:14:31,333 --> 01:14:32,834
and you always made it through.

1379
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:37,300
But after I lost my mother,
I made up my mind

1380
01:14:37,433 --> 01:14:39,300
to take charge of my own life.

1381
01:14:41,100 --> 01:14:42,934
I had you to help me,
Grandpa Frank,

1382
01:14:43,066 --> 01:14:47,166
but I made my own decisions.

1383
01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:51,100
And I found my own way to be
the person that I wanted to be.

1384
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:55,100
And now, now, I...

1385
01:14:55,233 --> 01:14:59,000
Now, everyone is asking
you to wait,

1386
01:14:59,133 --> 01:15:01,367
to be patient,

1387
01:15:01,500 --> 01:15:03,266
and it just doesn't feel
like enough.

1388
01:15:05,633 --> 01:15:08,533
Luke showed me what it means
to love Christmas again.

1389
01:15:10,133 --> 01:15:14,667
But all of these lights
and decorations,

1390
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,367
they just remind me that
he's thousands of miles away,

1391
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:21,934
that it's dangerous,
and he could get hurt.

1392
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:28,700
So, I can't just sit here
anymore, hoping.

1393
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:30,767
I need to do something.

1394
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,667
I need to do something
to make things better.

1395
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:39,233
If there's anything that
we can do, Taylor, you got it.

1396
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:41,166
Charlie,

1397
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:43,467
I need you to make
a call for me.

1398
01:15:52,834 --> 01:15:54,533
You made it.

1399
01:15:54,667 --> 01:15:57,433
I have to say, when you called,
I thought you were crazy.

1400
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,266
But now, seeing you
both here, well,

1401
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,934
I still think this is crazy.

1402
01:16:02,066 --> 01:16:04,500
It seems like yesterday.
Been too long.

1403
01:16:04,633 --> 01:16:07,433
Taylor, this is
Colonel Clay Murphy.

1404
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:09,934
Clay, this is Taylor Nichols,
Luke's fiancé.

1405
01:16:10,066 --> 01:16:11,300
Hi.

1406
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:12,767
It's so nice to meet you.

1407
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,166
And thank you so much
for making this happen.

1408
01:16:15,300 --> 01:16:17,166
Ah, the pleasure is all mine.

1409
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,233
Charlie called asking
for a Christmas miracle,

1410
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:20,734
and I was happy I could deliver.

1411
01:16:20,867 --> 01:16:23,233
Captain Malone
is one of a kind in my book.

1412
01:16:23,367 --> 01:16:24,667
Well, I think so, too.

1413
01:16:24,800 --> 01:16:26,233
Let's get you inside.

1414
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,266
Charlie:
So, what's the latest?

1415
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,280
Well, there was a break
in the storm long enough

1416
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:36,467
to drop the captain's unit here,
where they went on foot

1417
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:40,300
and made contact with
the downed chopper crew, here.

1418
01:16:40,433 --> 01:16:41,900
When we last received word,

1419
01:16:42,033 --> 01:16:43,400
they'd regrouped with
their chopper

1420
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:45,066
and were making their way back.

1421
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,033
We've been told to prepare
for injuries.

1422
01:16:49,700 --> 01:16:53,066
Um, do you think
they'll make it back tonight?

1423
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,600
Hard to say.
It's a wild one out there.

1424
01:16:56,734 --> 01:16:58,066
For now, they're on their own.

1425
01:17:03,033 --> 01:17:05,667
It's not unheard of
in missions like this, Taylor,

1426
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:07,500
to lose contact.

1427
01:17:07,633 --> 01:17:09,499
I'm sure that everything
is going to be just fine.

1428
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,000
We just have to wait it out.

1429
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,133
You okay, Taylor?

1430
01:17:52,967 --> 01:17:55,300
So, this is it.

1431
01:17:58,133 --> 01:18:01,467
This is all he has of home.

1432
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:02,767
Charlie:
That's right.

1433
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:04,934
It's you.

1434
01:18:05,066 --> 01:18:06,734
You're his home.

1435
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:42,800
Man:
Near the entrance.

1436
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:48,066
Man:
Warm.

1437
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:50,433
Woman:
Try to get it warmed up.

1438
01:18:50,567 --> 01:18:52,667
Woman: First aid kit.

1439
01:18:54,100 --> 01:18:56,900
Woman:
Open up. Clear in the back.

1440
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:58,367
Luke? Is Luke here?

1441
01:19:07,433 --> 01:19:09,300
Taylor?

1442
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:20,333
What are you doing here?

1443
01:19:20,467 --> 01:19:21,967
Are you okay? Is everybody okay?

1444
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:25,633
I'm fine. Yeah. Everyone's fine.
What are you doing here?

1445
01:19:27,233 --> 01:19:29,800
I couldn't wait any longer,

1446
01:19:29,934 --> 01:19:33,033
so I made our Christmas wish
come true.

1447
01:19:33,166 --> 01:19:35,433
I brought Christmas to you.

1448
01:20:15,266 --> 01:20:18,100
Luke
Taylor, when you first met me,

1449
01:20:18,233 --> 01:20:22,967
I was wearing a red suit
with a big, long, white beard.

1450
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,233
You couldn't see me,
but I could see you.

1451
01:20:27,834 --> 01:20:29,467
It's no secret to anyone here

1452
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:32,633
just how much I love Christmas.

1453
01:20:35,667 --> 01:20:38,500
You look good, brother.
Thanks.

1454
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:40,200
Luke But I didn't understand

1455
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:43,433
what it truly meant
until I fell in love with you.

1456
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:48,667
It means that wherever we are,

1457
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,500
we'll always be together.

1458
01:20:50,633 --> 01:20:53,533
Connected.

1459
01:20:53,667 --> 01:20:57,133
Feeling the joy and happiness
that we feel on this day.

1460
01:21:00,667 --> 01:21:03,066
Taylor
Luke, I remember the night

1461
01:21:03,200 --> 01:21:04,500
we first met, too.

1462
01:21:04,633 --> 01:21:06,667
Here we go.
Here we go.

1463
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:08,934
Taylor Your bright eyes,

1464
01:21:09,066 --> 01:21:11,734
your warm laugh.

1465
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:14,400
And I wondered how anyone
could be so jolly

1466
01:21:14,533 --> 01:21:16,500
wearing that scratchy beard.

1467
01:21:16,633 --> 01:21:19,233
But most of all,

1468
01:21:19,367 --> 01:21:21,567
I remember the way
you made me feel

1469
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:24,934
when you said you hoped
my Christmas wish comes true.

1470
01:21:25,066 --> 01:21:28,266
You gave me hope

1471
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,533
on a night
that I was feeling lost

1472
01:21:30,667 --> 01:21:32,934
and afraid to move on.

1473
01:21:37,967 --> 01:21:40,433
And now,

1474
01:21:40,567 --> 01:21:43,400
thanks to you,

1475
01:21:43,533 --> 01:21:46,967
I have only one wish
on my Christmas list...

1476
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:52,033
and that's to spend
every Christmas with you

1477
01:21:52,166 --> 01:21:54,467
for the rest of our lives.

1478
01:22:00,467 --> 01:22:04,233
Taylor, with this ring,

1479
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:06,800
I promise to love you

1480
01:22:06,934 --> 01:22:09,667
and care for you,

1481
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,767
and spend the rest of my life
making sure that

1482
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,066
all of your Christmas wishes,

1483
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,000
they all come true.

1484
01:22:23,967 --> 01:22:27,900
Taylor:
Luke, with this ring,

1485
01:22:28,033 --> 01:22:32,600
I promise to share with you
whatever lies ahead.

1486
01:22:32,734 --> 01:22:34,600
Laughter,

1487
01:22:34,734 --> 01:22:36,934
tears,

1488
01:22:37,066 --> 01:22:38,734
troubles,

1489
01:22:38,867 --> 01:22:40,400
and joys.

1490
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:45,767
But above all,

1491
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:49,767
a love that will last forever.

1492
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:03,300
