1
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,668
- What can I get you?
- Another Brandy, please.

2
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,612
Here you are.

3
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:09,238
- Can I get a pillow for your friend?
- He's okay. Thanks.

4
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,843
I had a dream I was a circus clown.

5
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,384
But the circus was underwater.

6
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,639
Somewhere in Japan, I think.

7
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,974
Everything was blue.

8
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,936
Normally, I associate red with the circus.

9
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,856
I think me costume was red though.

10
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,942
Like a Matisse painting, la danse.

11
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:49,153
Mmm?

12
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:53,160
There are five nudes dancing in a circle...
Four women and one man.

13
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,242
Their hands connecting,
all except the last woman

14
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,617
who's reaching back for the man.

15
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,912
And he reaches back for her,
but they don't connect.

16
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,963
Oh, so it's not an unbroken chain then.

17
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,051
Yes.

18
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,340
- Is it a big canvas?
- Very big.

19
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,296
It's in the hermitage in Leningrad.

20
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:12,054
There's a man who led a happy life,
wouldn't you say?

21
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,476
Matisse?

22
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,928
Until he was crippled.

23
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,482
But I don't imagine people
said a lot of bad things about him.

24
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,901
I wonder what they'll say about me.

25
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:24,900
Probably that he worried too much
about what people said about him.

26
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,403
- Is that wrong?
- I suppose not.

27
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,702
What do you want people to say about you
when you've gone?

28
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,371
That I gave my all for what I believed in,

29
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,915
that I never let the Beatles down,

30
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,617
that I came to know myself.

31
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:41,539
- You won't let us down.
- Kind of you to say so.

32
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:44,466
It's just a gut feeling.
I feel like you'd do anything for us.

33
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,343
Would you like a scotch and coke?

34
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,430
Sure.

35
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,301
The gentleman would like
a scotch and coke.

36
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:55,706
Would you like some nuts with that?

37
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,846
No, that'll be fine as it is. Thanks.

38
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,770
Marvelous deportment,
wouldn't you say, old chap?

39
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:04,729
Of course.
British European hire good-looking girls.

40
00:06:04,823 --> 00:06:06,863
Yeah, but she was especially nice,
wouldn't you say?

41
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,032
- Could say that.
- And what would you say?

42
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,486
I would say she's especially nice.
She seemed to like you.

43
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:14,367
Maybe I should invite her in for tea then.

44
00:06:14,457 --> 00:06:15,977
Don't be silly. This is not a long flight.

45
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:17,912
She'll probably be returning home
straightaway.

46
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:20,790
Or maybe she'll lay over
in Barcelona for 24 hours.

47
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,025
It's important that you remember
the purpose of this trip.

48
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,664
The only purpose. Rest.

49
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:27,546
And you're not gonna get it
by cavorting with pretty girls.

50
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,712
Here you are.

51
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,887
Ta.

52
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,590
Can I get you anything else?

53
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,347
Where are you from?

54
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:40,351
I'm based in London now,
but I come from Nottingham.

55
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,228
Yeah, we did a show there in January.

56
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:44,422
- They like us in Nottingham.
- The ones that came.

57
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,507
There was so much snow,
we thought that no one would turn up.

58
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,317
- But they did.
- Yes.

59
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,148
- This is Brian.
- How do you do?

60
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,154
- Pleasure's mine.
- What's your name?

61
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,245
Marianne.

62
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,616
- Beautiful name.
- Thank you.

63
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,038
I quite like it too.

64
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:59,533
Are you on holiday?

65
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:02,040
No. We're just poppin' over
to knock around at gaudi's.

66
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,667
Oh, yes. I must get back to work.

67
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:09,209
I wonder if I might have
an autograph photo sent by post?

68
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,635
Of me or the Beatles?

69
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,178
How about both?

70
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,757
I've got an even better idea.
Will you be in Barcelona long?

71
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:19,390
Uh, I'll be flying on to Rome,
but I'll be back in a couple of days.

72
00:07:19,481 --> 00:07:21,722
Yeah, well, I'm gonna give you
the number of our hotel.

73
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,931
What is it, Brian?

74
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,984
It's 318520.

75
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:28,357
Have you got a pen?

76
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,074
Now, you be sure and call us
as soon as you get back. Yeah?

77
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,409
This is smashing, isn't it?

78
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,184
I suppose this thing happens to you often?

79
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,541
What? Part of the job.

80
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,169
- But you will call?
- I will.

81
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,007
Wasn't I right? Isn't she especially nice?

82
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,098
Yes.

83
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,078
- What's your problem, eppie?
- Oh, no problem.

84
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,468
This was supposed to be
four days' solid relaxation for you

85
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,972
without any distractions.

86
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,146
But we can still have that.
She's just a bird.

87
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,518
Birds are harmless.

88
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,901
Otherwise,
we're liable to drive each other mad,

89
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,444
left to our own devices.

90
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,816
Care to elaborate?

91
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,321
Someone should put music on these flights.

92
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,790
Not a bad idea.

93
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,632
Is our hotel still as lovely as ever?

94
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,843
Excuse me?

95
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:40,516
I'm sure it is.
You always choose the best hotels, Brian.

96
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,595
I try. I haven't been to Barcelona
for a while though.

97
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,628
There's a hell of a lot
one can do to unwind.

98
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,392
- Do you agree?
- If you say so.

99
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,603
You act as though
you couldn't be less interested.

100
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,279
- You're right.
- Why is that?

101
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,987
I only came here to get away with you.

102
00:08:57,078 --> 00:09:00,115
We could've gone
to the fuckin' north pole for all I care.

103
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,486
What time do you want to eat?

104
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,081
I wanna have a rest and, uh...
Take a shower.

105
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,453
- Say 9:00?
- Sounds good.

106
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,164
Muy bien. ; Como te llamas?

107
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,170
- Miguel.
- Muchas gracias, Miguel.

108
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,261
Gracias.

109
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,385
I wonder if Elvis
drinks chateau latour '49.

110
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,015
With hamburger, no doubt.

111
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,919
Did your mother feed you a lot
of chicken liver when you were a kid?

112
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,353
Only occasionally.

113
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,527
I looked forward most
to the passover feast

114
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,925
because we got to help
the servants scrub all the utensils down,

115
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,359
make everything kosher.

116
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,331
Why? Were they dirty
the rest of the year round?

117
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,572
No, silly. They were always clean.

118
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,850
Then what's the point of scrubbing them
down if they're already clean?

119
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,614
Well, to get them cleaner, I suppose.

120
00:11:49,709 --> 00:11:51,665
Very good logic.

121
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:54,085
Does it bother you that the, uh, chef here

122
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,709
probably spits in his gazpacho soup?

123
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,084
That's an awful thought.

124
00:11:58,176 --> 00:11:59,882
What makes you think he spits in it?

125
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,960
I noticed the color was a bit off.

126
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,535
Well, I prefer not to think about it.

127
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:07,182
It's like thinking about how many people
urinate in a public pool.

128
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,975
I'm one of the worst pool pissers
there is, and I can't even swim.

129
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,348
You piss in the pool?

130
00:12:12,649 --> 00:12:14,640
Well, sometimes I suppose
it's hard not to.

131
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,725
Especially if you stand
in the right place

132
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,936
and all that hot water comes
shooting between your legs.

133
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,487
Doesn't that make you wanna piss?

134
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,280
I suppose so.

135
00:12:23,368 --> 00:12:26,030
Me best mate showed me
a game to play in the baths.

136
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,202
V-2 it was called.

137
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:31,452
The lads would queue up at the pump
where the hot water gets pushed out.

138
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,703
One by one, we'd pull down our khaks...

139
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,873
And shove our ass up against the hole.

140
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:39,547
You could only feel a strong jet
push against ya.

141
00:12:39,634 --> 00:12:41,465
Slowly you let it find your arsehole,

142
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,464
and when you did, man, it would
send a rush up through your insides

143
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,216
and you go forward like a buzz bomb.

144
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,888
Fascinating.

145
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,514
I also found a few uses for the intake
hole till me prick grew too large.

146
00:12:57,694 --> 00:12:59,104
I'm stuffed like a pig.

147
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,312
You go ahead and finish.

148
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:13,143
The lads are probably
having a big party without us.

149
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,271
You're not allowed to think about them.
Doctor's orders.

150
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:19,163
Dr. b. Epstein,
certified faith healer and proctologist.

151
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,165
What a shitty job that must be.

152
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,625
No pun intended.

153
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:29,089
Kind of like cleaning out
the sewers in liverpool.

154
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,121
Not trying to deride your occupation.

155
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,729
It's just...

156
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,430
It puts me off to think about doin' it,

157
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,311
and it hurts to think
about having it done.

158
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,233
But you think about it no less.

159
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,771
I do, but it bugs me a lot.

160
00:13:46,409 --> 00:13:48,991
I suppose the one advantage
is you can't get pregnant.

161
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,193
True.

162
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,992
Don't take away any of the pleasure.

163
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,197
None at all.

164
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:57,204
Yeah. You can't tell me it's not painful.

165
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,957
- It's a question of relaxation.
- Relaxation?

166
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,693
How can you be relaxed when some bloke's
about to ram his pecker up ya?

167
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:04,332
You look into his eyes.

168
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:06,588
- And that's reassuring?
- Yes.

169
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,299
For you, it's a reassurance.

170
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:15,602
I don't reckon I'd hurt anyone.
I'm not so very large now.

171
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,144
No.

172
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,222
- But large enough.
- Of course.

173
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,432
And you?

174
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:21,978
The same.

175
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,608
That was good cognac.

176
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,840
And at this rate,
you'll have reason to be thankful for it.

177
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,526
You act like a victim.

178
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,903
Well, the thought
does anything but relax me.

179
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,030
Well, don't think about it then.

180
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,451
How about a game of cards?

181
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,079
- What'll it be?
- Pontoon?

182
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,170
Capital.

183
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,745
All right then.

184
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:45,527
Bust.

185
00:15:51,242 --> 00:15:54,575
I was surprised you brought up
what you brought up just now.

186
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,402
Why is it so awkward
when we talk about it?

187
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,703
Don't know.

188
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,496
Puts me in a very awkward position.

189
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,826
I get the feeling I'm supposed to bring
it up, and then I'm damned for doing so.

190
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,328
I enjoy hearing about your conquests.

191
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,129
This lorry driver, that docker.

192
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:09,172
Yes, well, that's all very well.

193
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,779
But it's when it comes closer to home.

194
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,044
I just don't know what to say
when that happens.

195
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,722
- We could always talk shop.
- Of course.

196
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:19,808
Well, then what else
do we need to talk about?

197
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,306
Absolutely nothing.

198
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,139
I suppose I should realize
it's hopeless once and for all.

199
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:31,361
I find you an engaging
and remarkable man, Brian.

200
00:16:31,449 --> 00:16:33,440
I've never met a man like you.

201
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,179
I don't really want
to have it off with ya.

202
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,659
But you've never ruled it out.

203
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:38,891
That would be putting you
in an awful place, wouldn't it?

204
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:41,452
It has to be better
than what I've been feeling lately.

205
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,367
If you don't fuck me, who will you fuck?

206
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:47,044
It's a cold, cruel world out there, Brian.

207
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:52,758
Everyone thinks we're off
humping the weekend away.

208
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,087
That really fucking pisses me off.

209
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,431
Sometimes I just wanna smash something.

210
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,265
I think we better call it a night.

211
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,065
All right then.

212
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,811
Get this stuff out of here, will ya?

213
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,233
This is Mr. Epstein.

214
00:17:13,324 --> 00:17:15,485
Would you please
send someone up for our trays?

215
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,656
Thank you.

216
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:21,696
Have you had a chance
to look at what you'd like to do tomorrow?

217
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,531
Why don't you look
at the guidebook tonight

218
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,457
and we can discuss it over breakfast?

219
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,585
Get some rest.

220
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,999
Yeah?

221
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,951
John, I finally reached you.

222
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,126
Oh, hello.

223
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,000
The operator's been trying all afternoon.

224
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,377
Just as well. I've been asleep.

225
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,004
How was your flight?

226
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,676
All is well.

227
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,424
You're exhausted, aren't you?

228
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:22,131
No. What makes you think I'm exhausted?

229
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,390
Just everything.
After you left, I felt just awful.

230
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,603
You wanted me to go.

231
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:31,148
I know, but I still felt just awful.

232
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,602
There's nothing to say.

233
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,905
Why is there never anything to say?

234
00:18:37,992 --> 00:18:40,825
I've got nothing to say. Leave me alone.

235
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:44,904
Why? Because maybe you'd rather be here
with us. You're being impossible.

236
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,911
How fucking profound.
Stick it up your stinking ass.

237
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:50,584
I wanna see me son,
but I won't feel guilty for it.

238
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:54,289
He smiled the most beautiful smile foday.

239
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:58,672
Do you care? Do you care that your aunt's
driving me up the bleedin' wall?

240
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,503
You should be glad you've got her help.

241
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,635
Thats true, but it doesn't compensate
for her driving me up the wall.

242
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,056
I miss you. Is that so wrong?

243
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,389
- No.
- But that's the way it is, huh?

244
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,146
This is a fucking beautiful place.

245
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,694
I feel like I'm in another world.

246
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:20,569
This man, gaudi,
was a real original in his day.

247
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,525
- When did he live?
- Into the century,

248
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,487
but, uh, his work sort of
stands outside of time.

249
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:26,821
You know what I mean?

250
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,953
Yeah. How about the bullfights?

251
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,000
How about the bullfights? Now?

252
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,123
I only just got here.

253
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:36,080
But you're going fo the bullfights?

254
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,335
When are they, Sunday?

255
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,291
Mm-hmm, think so.

256
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:40,718
Eppie's all excited.

257
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:42,966
Sounds like a fucking bore to me.

258
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,639
Fucking brutal too.

259
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,967
Poking those poor animals till they drop.

260
00:19:48,062 --> 00:19:50,849
God. I don't know what he sees in it.

261
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,181
I think it's a sort of pageantry.

262
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,731
John. Yeah?

263
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:01,314
I don't know.
Sometimes I just wanna say so much,

264
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:04,572
and then it fizzles away
before I can get it out of me mouth.

265
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,028
- It's raining outside.
- It's not here.

266
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:13,500
Just now, I'd like to hold you.

267
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:16,162
Oh, John.

268
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:20,458
Are you gonna hang up now?

269
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:25,463
I had an awful dream last night.
Do you want fo hear it?

270
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:29,174
I dreamt it was a glorious day

271
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,352
and we were living in a big city.

272
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:33,475
- In London?
- Probably.

273
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,147
And I took the baby out in the pram.

274
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:38,692
And a horde of angry women
came down on us.

275
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:42,021
When I told them fo be gone,
they struck me and started kicking me.

276
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,027
- In the face?
- Yeah.

277
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,860
Everywhere. Then I was unconscious.

278
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:50,617
And when I came fo,
the pram was empty and everyone was gone.

279
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,164
And then a magistrate appeared

280
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,788
and announced I wouldn't be
allowed to keep the baby.

281
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,540
And I was shattered.

282
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,373
But you just stood by and said nothing.

283
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:02,959
You were wearing a wig,
like the magistrate.

284
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,672
I'm gonna hang up.

285
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,648
Bergman has a whole new language
just for that film.

286
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:46,288
The only familiar thing
is the goldberg variations.

287
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,123
It's the funniest thing but, last night,

288
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,834
when I went up to my room,
it was playing on the radio.

289
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,386
It moved me deeply.

290
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,343
Do you know why bach wrote that music?

291
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,469
As a lullaby.

292
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,551
For young goldberg
to play to his protector...

293
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:01,479
Count kaiserling...
To relieve his pain and insomnia.

294
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,396
Clever man, bach.

295
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:05,020
Clever man you are, eppie.

296
00:24:07,738 --> 00:24:09,854
That film would shatter Cynthia.

297
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,573
Sometimes I'd like to shatter her.

298
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:15,071
What do you think of Cynthia?

299
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,699
You're good for her,
though I couldn't tell you why.

300
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,701
- That's not what I asked ya.
- No.

301
00:24:19,792 --> 00:24:21,657
Well, then answer me, why don't ya?

302
00:24:21,752 --> 00:24:23,208
- No.
- Why not?

303
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,255
You don't want to know
what I think about Cynthia.

304
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,192
What you think
carries a lot of weight with me, Brian.

305
00:24:27,216 --> 00:24:28,752
I know.

306
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,424
To be honest, I was prepared to hate her,
but I don't hate her.

307
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:34,424
I mean... she's wonderful.
It's just, uh...

308
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,345
I don't know.

309
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,309
Sometimes I want a woman to push me,
like a strong wind.

310
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:45,059
Sometimes I want a woman to eat my shit.

311
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,768
What should we do tonight then?

312
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,524
What sounds good? Dancing?

313
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,526
Yeah. But at a fag joint.

314
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:56,780
But why? I don't even know the city well.

315
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,782
Surely someone back home
gave you a few suggestions.

316
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,625
Someone at the magic clock
actually did give me this.

317
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,249
"The club bauhaus.

318
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,506
Private gentlemen's salon.

319
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:13,709
This guest membership admits two."

320
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,193
My, what a swinging place this is.

321
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,646
Well, it's early yet.

322
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,076
- What would you like?
- Scotch and coke.

323
00:25:39,163 --> 00:25:41,654
- This all right?
- Fine.

324
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,582
Un Brandy y un scotch con Coca-Cola,
por favor.

325
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:50,121
I have not tried that combination.
Is it a good one?

326
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,252
It's not bad. It's for my friend.

327
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,218
Muchas gracias.

328
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,228
Ta.

329
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,974
You are both from england?

330
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,812
I'd say it's a fair guess
considering I haven't spoken to ya.

331
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,112
I love england.

332
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:18,612
I spend more time in London and New York
than I do in Barcelona.

333
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:19,612
Please.

334
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,534
Though Barcelona is my home.

335
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,328
We're from liverpool, north of england.

336
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,905
Yes, I know it.

337
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,286
I was just sayin'
what a swingin' place this is.

338
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,742
Does it get any better later on?

339
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,702
Well, this is a very exclusive club.

340
00:26:30,798 --> 00:26:32,334
Maybe a bit too exclusive, eh?

341
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,882
I prefer a certain casino,
but it's rather early yet.

342
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,550
Really? What's your game?

343
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:40,505
Blackjack, though I love roulette.

344
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:43,056
Uh, you also enjoy deep play?

345
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,303
Very deep play.

346
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:46,100
N-not so much, really.

347
00:26:46,188 --> 00:26:48,520
Perhaps I could take you
to my favorite casino.

348
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,064
Well, that's very kind of you. Um...

349
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,813
Oh, forgive me.
I have not introduced myself.

350
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,486
I'm called Quinones. Arturo Quinones.

351
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,063
Epstein. Brian Epstein.

352
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,319
- This is, uh...
- Lennon. John Lennon.

353
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,994
Mr. Epstein.

354
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,823
Your accent is not that of a person
from liverpool.

355
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,657
I was educated at various places,

356
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,494
amongst them,
the royal academy of dramatic art.

357
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:14,295
Though I'm no actor, I assure you.

358
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,999
Somehow I never tire of actors.

359
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,085
Forgive me if I've offended you.

360
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,044
No, I'm not an actor either.

361
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,630
I broker commodities.

362
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,056
Close one, eh, Brian?

363
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,806
Now, you... you could be an actor.

364
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,852
Sorry. I play rock and roll.

365
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,180
Really?

366
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:34,108
I'm radio Luxembourg's
biggest fan here in Barcelona.

367
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,855
Well, there we go. Buy the man a beer.

368
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,786
Then you've probably
already heard the Beatles.

369
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:39,105
Why, yes, of course.

370
00:27:40,826 --> 00:27:44,990
Oh, forgive me. I did not
make the connections with your names.

371
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,822
Huh. Well, this is smashing.

372
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:51,534
- Now I can say I've met a beatle and...
- His manager.

373
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,584
Just don't ask for a lock of me hair then.

374
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,872
I would love to see you perform.

375
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,707
I'm afraid we don't gyrate very much.

376
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,542
We just sort of stand there and play.

377
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,593
Compelling nonetheless.

378
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,263
- Are we compelling, Brian?
- Absolutely.

379
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,636
Oh, well, I imagine the girls think so.

380
00:28:07,728 --> 00:28:09,184
That they do.

381
00:28:09,271 --> 00:28:12,263
What an enviable position
for a young man to hold.

382
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:16,225
- It has its ins and outs.
- As does commodities, I'm sure.

383
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,435
Yes.

384
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,154
I believe their music
is being seriously appreciated

385
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:23,152
by more and more people now.

386
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,859
I, for one,
seriously appreciate Mr. Lennon.

387
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:29,572
It sometimes makes it difficult for
his wife, all this serious appreciation.

388
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,781
Me wife, yeah.

389
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,202
Would you gentleman
like another drink here,

390
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,162
or shall we go on somewhere else?

391
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,213
Our hotel's not very far from here,

392
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:42,259
so, uh, why don't we carry on there?

393
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:44,712
A smashing idea, Mr. Lennon.

394
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,343
- Sound good, Brian?
- Right.

395
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:55,685
Mr. Lennon, I'm afraid your creme de cacao
lies heavily on my stomach.

396
00:28:55,776 --> 00:28:58,233
I will be unable to face my wife tonight.

397
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,151
'Fraid you'll spew in her face then?

398
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,572
Charming thought.

399
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:05,740
You've got a wife?

400
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,237
Yes, my betrothed.

401
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:10,662
You're happily married then?

402
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,455
Yes, happily married.

403
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:15,329
But since you seem so interested,

404
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:19,129
I will tell you that, at first,
I did not want to marry her.

405
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:23,630
When I told my parents this, they
threatened to expel me from the family.

406
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,089
So... I capitulated. I'm not sorry I did.

407
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,765
But I do not look to my wife

408
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,683
for what she cannot give me.

409
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,352
Forgive me, but I wonder

410
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,306
how such a union
can be finally satisfying?

411
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:41,269
She is tender and loving
and fair as a Princess.

412
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:45,106
But, so far,
unsuccessful in bearing child.

413
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,940
What will you do about it?

414
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:52,029
She's seeing a new doctor in Paris
who promises that she's not barren.

415
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,785
So, it is a question of time.

416
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:57,743
How sad... since you seem
to want a child so badly.

417
00:29:57,838 --> 00:30:02,127
It would not be the end of the world
if she cannot bear a child.

418
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,673
My family thinks differently,

419
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,752
but, uh, I cannot help what they think.

420
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,963
You mustn't worry what they think.

421
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,173
My family worries for me too.

422
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:13,554
But you are still a bachelor.

423
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:16,307
My mother would like to see me happy.
That's all.

424
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,431
You will prevail in the end.

425
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,642
Thank you.

426
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,923
How about listening
to some of the latest in merseybeat,

427
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:25,562
seeing as how you're a fan?

428
00:30:28,035 --> 00:30:32,278
Unfortunately,
I have an early flight to Stockholm.

429
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,325
Well, we're in town till the weekend.

430
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:42,413
Unfortunately,
I'm away until the middle of the month.

431
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,964
But you will call on me
when you're next here.

432
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:49,045
Mr. Epstein, it has been a pleasure.

433
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:52,256
I wish you your own happiness.

434
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,091
How about some coffee before we go?

435
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,974
Thank you, Mr. Lennon,
but I really must be off.

436
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,265
Gentlemen, good night.

437
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:24,045
Why the hell did you go on like that?

438
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:27,044
- He was interested in you.
- Rubbish! In you maybe.

439
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,295
Yeah, well, I'm a happily married man,
just like he is.

440
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,698
Right. And as soon as he knew that,

441
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,429
he had nothing left
to say to either of us.

442
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,203
You'd have found it easier
if you loosened up.

443
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,060
He was a fascistic anti-semite.
I didn't like him one bit.

444
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,228
And I wish you'd stop
what doesn't become you.

445
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,315
Sorry.

446
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:44,729
I know you meant well.

447
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,227
It's all futile.

448
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,608
You keep saying that,
but you got the world at your fingertips.

449
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,318
I haven't the one thing that would make
the slightest difference.

450
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,077
I think we'd better say good night.
I'm feeling a trifle queasy.

451
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,937
Come in, Miguel.

452
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:29,607
I've just spent an insufferable evening
with an insufferable fascist.

453
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:32,116
Thank you.

454
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:35,825
Thank god you're here. Sit down.

455
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,202
- Like your drink?
- Yes.

456
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:48,039
It's your bloody liqueurs.
They're bloody 100-percent syrup.

457
00:32:48,133 --> 00:32:50,715
I don't know why I ever talked myself
into coming here.

458
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:53,418
It's a most unfriendly city,
wouldn't you say?

459
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,504
No, of course you wouldn't say.
You're from here.

460
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,846
Why couldn't this be
the riviera or north Africa?

461
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:03,019
Marrakesh. Now, there's a city
to sit back and grow old in.

462
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,605
Oh, don't worry, I'll take care of you.

463
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,604
Where is your friend?

464
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,777
Where's my friend?
I don't know where my friend is.

465
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:14,402
That's the bloody problem. That's why
I called you here. That's why I wanted...

466
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,109
Well, he's probably out on the town,
singing to some woman.

467
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:19,945
Which is not a bad idea.

468
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,782
Do you know
you're a most attractive young man?

469
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,371
I suppose a blow job
is out of the question?

470
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,212
I'm sorry. It's all right.

471
00:33:33,303 --> 00:33:35,715
I only really invited you here
to talk to you. You can relax.

472
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:45,262
Do you know John's just had a baby?
Well, John's wife, Cynthia.

473
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:47,222
A baby? You understand?

474
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,567
More worry in the world.

475
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,520
Another poor bastard.

476
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:57,862
Well, not quite a bastard, but I suppose...

477
00:33:57,953 --> 00:34:00,569
The little beggar
will love the bastard too.

478
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:03,326
Do you know, sometimes
I hate him so much I want to die.

479
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,450
He's my only chance.

480
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,007
Are you eating enough
and staying out of trouble?

481
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:16,960
Eating enough? I should think so.

482
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,175
And so far, there hasn't been
any trouble to get into.

483
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:20,972
Don't let John stir up any.

484
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,390
Now, how could he do that?

485
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,968
Rock and rollers know all sorts of ways.

486
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,304
I think I can handle myself, mother.

487
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,355
That's what I'm afraid of

488
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,315
can you imagine how big America is?

489
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,023
A lot bigger than New Zealand.

490
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:40,200
Doesn't America fascinate you?

491
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:41,287
Sure.

492
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:45,288
- Could anything be bigger than America?
- Yeanh.

493
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:48,412
Just stand by that bush
while I take your picture.

494
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,585
- I'm not very good at this.
- Of course you are.

495
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:51,912
Dandies love to pose.

496
00:34:52,007 --> 00:34:53,167
I beg your pardon?

497
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,544
Dandies love to pose, I said.

498
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:05,259
Come now. Look like you just found a nice
tight ass you'd like to stick it in.

499
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:21,233
Have you talked to Cynthia?

500
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,569
Supposin' I don't wanna
talk about her with you?

501
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,664
Sometimes I worry how she'll bear up.

502
00:35:27,751 --> 00:35:30,117
Well, that's something
you've got no control over.

503
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,419
Why must you be so biting?

504
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,340
You know what jung would call you?

505
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,672
One queer Jew.

506
00:35:39,763 --> 00:35:41,128
I don't think so.

507
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:46,008
Lighten up.
This is supposed to be a holiday.

508
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:52,764
How can you do this to me?

509
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,599
What choice have you but to let me?

510
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,776
- None.
- Well, shut up then.

511
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,821
- Have you got a choice?
- In the end, no.

512
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,592
All right, eppie.

513
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,679
Sounds like you're having fun.

514
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:02,269
I've been waiting for you
to scrub me back.

515
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,276
Right.

516
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:55,264
Are you all right, John?

517
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,740
Are you angry?

518
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:23,253
No.

519
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:26,746
What are you thinking?

520
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:30,713
Nothin' I can put into words.

521
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,433
Hello?

522
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:41,386
He's indisposed right now.
“Who is it?

523
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,600
Who's speaking?

524
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:47,726
Who? Oh.

525
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,861
It's marianne. “Who?

526
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,862
All right, yeah. Um, where is she?

527
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,364
Where are you, marianne?

528
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:01,786
- She's downstairs.
- Well, send her up then.

529
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,367
Marianne, John would like to see you.

530
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,702
Can you come up?

531
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,872
No, just come up. You're alone, yes?

532
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:10,877
Good. Bye.

533
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:16,023
I suppose she'll bring you
out of your state.

534
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,964
- Do you want me to leave?
- No, don't.

535
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:20,471
A minute ago,
you couldn't get away from me fast enough.

536
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:21,846
What did you expect?

537
00:41:21,938 --> 00:41:23,974
I made allowances.

538
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,865
I'm always making allowances
for other people.

539
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:29,309
Just once, I should like to feel
as if I wasn't making allowances.

540
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:32,396
I suspect Cynthia and I
have far more in common than we realize.

541
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,401
Cynthia's me wife, the mother of me child.

542
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,812
And where does that leave me, eh?

543
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:38,735
"Poor old eppie,
always getting himself into trouble.

544
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,350
The least I can do is offer him a shoulder
to rest his filthy head on."

545
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,580
Is that what you think?

546
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,291
Don't pretend to know what I think.

547
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:55,084
And with that, what never was has ended.

548
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,606
- Hello, marianne.
- Oh, hello.

549
00:42:09,694 --> 00:42:11,935
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- He's waiting for you.

550
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,903
What was your friend so upset over?

551
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:04,862
What makes you think he was upset?

552
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,677
- He looked like he was about to cry.
- That's just the way he looks.

553
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,917
I could say the same thing about you.

554
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:11,835
I'm not a morose person.

555
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,005
Lucky you. Let's drink to your gaiety.

556
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,633
- You torment him, don't you?
- He torments himself.

557
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,302
- But you torment him.
- Maybe we torment each other.

558
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:24,049
- You don't torment me.
- Pity.

559
00:43:24,143 --> 00:43:26,725
- But then again, no one does.
- I bet I could.

560
00:43:26,813 --> 00:43:28,394
No, I'm quite sure you couldn't.

561
00:43:28,481 --> 00:43:32,190
I'll have to take your stinkin' word
for it then, won't I?

562
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,518
- What's making you so low?
- What just happened.

563
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,855
- What's that?
- I can't tell ya.

564
00:43:38,950 --> 00:43:40,611
Tell me.

565
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,532
I promise I won't repeat it.

566
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,861
- Sorry.
- Okay.

567
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,999
- Was it something to do with your friend?
- Yes.

568
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,292
So I figured.

569
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:55,254
I think you both care about each other,

570
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,985
so it should work out all right
in the end.

571
00:43:57,009 --> 00:44:00,467
Sometimes I can't see that.
Sometimes pain knows no bounds.

572
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:03,297
- Imbalance is a rule.
- How can that be?

573
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:07,680
Same way our country
rapes another country.

574
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,353
Same way a man rapes a woman
when he marries her.

575
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:16,230
He comes in and establishes his presence

576
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,561
and makes himself indispensable...

577
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,571
Then drains every drop of her lifeblood.

578
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:24,617
But then she kicks him out.
So it all comes round in the end.

579
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:26,911
I'd just as soon skip the whole ordeal

580
00:44:26,998 --> 00:44:29,910
and remain imbalanced but free.

581
00:44:30,001 --> 00:44:31,741
What if I said I fancied ya?

582
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,911
Then you'd be a liar.

583
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:37,122
What if I said I wanted to lick your cunt?

584
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,217
Then I might, or I might not let you.

585
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,755
What if I asked you to leave?

586
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,386
Then I will be gone.

587
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:49,432
Would you remember me as special?

588
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:52,804
Not particularly.

589
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:54,639
You're not doing your part, Dolly bird.

590
00:44:55,568 --> 00:44:56,568
Nor you yours.

591
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:58,643
Yeah, but here we sit.

592
00:44:58,738 --> 00:44:59,853
Yes.

593
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,318
How would you most like to be remembered?

594
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,865
As kind or just?

595
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:06,905
Neither.

596
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,157
Or both.

597
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:15,334
- Do you fancy hearin'...
- Go on then.

598
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:17,753
An air hostess friend
brought it back from the states.

599
00:45:19,675 --> 00:45:21,111
I bet it's something I've already got.

600
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,500
It's not.

601
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,843
Bloody hell. I haven't.

602
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:26,762
How have you got this and not me?

603
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,181
I've only got the little Richard version.

604
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,633
But you should give this to me.

605
00:45:30,728 --> 00:45:33,515
Why should I give it to you? You're crazy.

606
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,972
- I want it.
- Too bad.

607
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,608
We opened for him in liverpool last year.

608
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,906
It's amazing, but Brian
was the only man he'd listen to.

609
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,029
Promoters hated him for it, but...

610
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:50,573
But I understood Richard.

611
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:52,872
The Georgia peach.

612
00:45:52,959 --> 00:45:55,291
Brian understands everyone
besides himself.

613
00:46:05,471 --> 00:46:08,838
J oh, yes, indeed

635
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:56,224
"Now, Lennon, that'll be too short.

636
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:58,239
Let it out another inch."

637
00:47:58,334 --> 00:48:00,245
All right, then, Brian, another inch.

638
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:06,623
"If you were wearing a wider collar,
you'd need a windsor knot, you know."

639
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:11,044
Yeah, but a four-in-hand's
easy to tie, it looks nicer too.

640
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,013
"Yes, but there'll be times
when you'll need a windsor knot,

641
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,720
and you'd better learn how to tie one."

642
00:48:20,815 --> 00:48:23,807
I don't need to learn.
You can tie it for me.

643
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,441
"Mmm. A tad long, but it'll do."

644
00:48:31,075 --> 00:48:32,861
Better long than short, eh?

645
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:37,737
"Now, then, boys, where are we going?"

646
00:48:37,832 --> 00:48:39,163
To the top, bri.

647
00:48:40,084 --> 00:48:41,290
"Where's that?"

648
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,868
To the top o' most of the pop o' most.

649
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:07,099
Where's marianne?

650
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,527
Out on the town, I expect.

651
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:13,068
Did you have a good visit?

652
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:15,608
We danced. It was very nice.

653
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:19,119
How are ya, mate?

654
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,286
Quite well.

655
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:25,785
Bullfights have got me all excited.

656
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,791
All that pageantry

657
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,622
and grace with pressure and so forth.

658
00:49:29,717 --> 00:49:31,958
- You wouldn't want to miss it.
- Hmm.

659
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,967
So, when were you first here?

660
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:40,720
A couple of years ago before I met you.

661
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,096
Mother sent me.

662
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:47,148
In a quiet section of west derby,
there's a lavatory.

663
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:48,314
And if you time it right,

664
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,643
you can find yourself
in a stream of dockers

665
00:49:50,738 --> 00:49:52,478
on their way home from work.

666
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:56,065
Sometimes my timing was right.
Sometimes it wasn't.

667
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,526
I had a fair batting average.

668
00:49:58,621 --> 00:50:01,784
But a fair batting average
doesn't always keep life interesting.

669
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:04,209
Anyway...

670
00:50:05,628 --> 00:50:06,628
One day...

671
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,338
After an especially dry spell...

672
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,501
I was sitting anxiously outside the loo...

673
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:20,848
In my sparkling hillman California,
waiting...

674
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,766
Always waiting...

675
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:25,390
When there came a savior
in a most appealing guise

676
00:50:25,481 --> 00:50:28,439
who said unto me, "come, my child."

677
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,891
Well, he didn't actually say that,

678
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,646
but happy a man was I

679
00:50:31,737 --> 00:50:33,819
until, with great brutal exactitude,

680
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:37,694
my savior proceeded to pound me
into a state of semiconsciousness,

681
00:50:37,785 --> 00:50:40,527
a river of blood like the styx
gushing from my head.

682
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:44,284
And gone were my wallet,
my watch, my money.

683
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,750
I made my way home,

684
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:52,000
and after telling my parents a slightly
laundered version of what had happened,

685
00:50:52,091 --> 00:50:55,128
believed it to be over until
the inevitable phone call demanding money,

686
00:50:55,219 --> 00:50:56,425
lots of it.

687
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,382
He'd recognized the family name

688
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,839
and decided to milk this one
for all it was worth.

689
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,014
I was all for paying him off
and forgetting about it,

690
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:08,100
but the family solicitor convinced me
that this was a matter for the police

691
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,431
who proceeded to apprehend my assailant

692
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:13,563
when the, uh, drop was finally made.

693
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,068
I don't suppose you've ever known
the honor of being addressed as Mr. x.

694
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,492
That's what I was mercifully called
during the trial.

695
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,573
My worthy opponent was put behind bars,

696
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,329
and I was sent to see a psychiatrist.

697
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:32,082
A lot of good that did me.

698
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,039
I was 25 years of age,
and by the time he came out for release,

699
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:39,252
I was in a state of nervous anxiety
I thought I would not live through.

700
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,257
Seriously.

701
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:42,617
Apparently, mother thought so, too,

702
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,241
because she sent me to Spain for a rest.

703
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:45,849
That's when I first came here.

704
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:52,314
Teetering on a precipice, as it were.

705
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:59,363
When I returned home,
I stood before another kind of precipice.

706
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,575
A month later, I met you at the cavern.

707
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:11,621
Promise me that in ten years' time,

708
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,418
no matter where each of us is,

709
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:16,292
and no matter
whom we're married to or involved with,

710
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:20,001
that you and I will meet here
on the ramblas,

711
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,336
30th of April, 1973.

712
00:52:23,766 --> 00:52:25,597
Well, at least remember it, okay?

713
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,267
Okay.

714
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,268
My god, they'll have landed
on the moon by then.

715
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:39,080
Paull -

716
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:41,298
John!

717
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:44,710
Ringo!

718
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,971
George!

719
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,430
Now please welcome...

720
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,637
The fabulous Beatles'

721
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,858
This is my special place.

722
00:54:51,330 --> 00:54:53,696
Not even my parents know I come up here.

723
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,917
You can see
all the businessmen going home.

724
00:55:00,756 --> 00:55:03,168
- You're not bored, are you?
- No.

725
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,374
I never want to bore you.

726
00:55:05,469 --> 00:55:07,551
You don't bore me.

727
00:55:07,638 --> 00:55:08,638
Good.

728
00:55:09,681 --> 00:55:12,343
- Do I bore you?
- Not at all.

729
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,469
Good.

730
00:55:18,398 --> 00:55:20,460
These times when we're together
are very special to me.

731
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,099
You know that.

732
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,151
Does my saying that embarrass you?

733
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:26,274
Not at all.

734
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:30,031
Does it embarrass you
my inviting you up here?

735
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,858
No.

736
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:34,445
I enjoy standing on the roof
of your parents' shop.

737
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:37,202
It's my shop too, you know.

738
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,907
This must be your roof then?

739
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,538
Fancy it is, yes.

740
00:55:45,217 --> 00:55:47,924
I'm gettin' cold.
It's gonna start raining soon.

741
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:50,586
That's the best time.

742
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:54,094
Best time for you maybe.
I wanna stay dry, mate.

743
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,766
You'll never leave me, will you?

744
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,390
What are you talkin' about?

745
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,062
Let's get something to eat.

746
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:06,017
Yeah? Okay.

747
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:09,071
Sure you've got time? Great. I'm starving.

748
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:26,046
I hope I'm not squeamish.

749
00:56:26,133 --> 00:56:28,215
Too far back to see any blood.

750
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:30,884
It's all very graceful from on high.

751
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,383
You're always so very reassuring.

752
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:35,930
Well, we can always leave
if it gets too much for you.

753
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:37,258
And I'm a cigarette.

754
00:56:37,282 --> 00:56:40,282
