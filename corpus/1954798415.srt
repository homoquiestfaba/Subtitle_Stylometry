1
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,956
Savitsky: I found
these paintings

2
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,626
rolled up under the
beds of old widows,

3
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,297
buried in family trash,

4
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:13,439
in dark corners of
artist's studios,

5
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,609
sometimes even patching
a hole in the roof.

6
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,383
I ended up with a collection
that no one in the.

7
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,252
Soviet Union would
dare to exhibit.

8
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:34,359
These were forbidden
works by artists who

9
00:01:34,361 --> 00:01:39,164
stayed true to their
vision, at a terrible cost.

10
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:56,074
Marinika: Russian
museums can't live

11
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:59,645
with the idea that such
a wonderful collection

12
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:03,582
was taken out from
Russia to this provincial

13
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:07,052
place somewhere in
Uzbekistan, God knows where.

14
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,862
Stephen: It really
wasn't that long ago

15
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,132
when what we now call
Uzbekistan was one of the

16
00:03:20,134 --> 00:03:23,235
most spectacular centers
of world culture.

17
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:26,772
The silk road ran right
through that region,

18
00:03:27,741 --> 00:03:31,043
but for a period of almost
a century Uzbekistan

19
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:35,147
had been just distant
province of the Soviet Union.

20
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:39,351
When the Soviet Union
collapsed I was asked to

21
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:42,688
cover this region that
nobody in the world really

22
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,556
ever thought about.

23
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,829
So, I decided I'm
going to get in a car

24
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,898
and find out what's out there.

25
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:57,936
For those people who
consider Uzbekistan to be

26
00:03:57,938 --> 00:04:00,172
hopelessly exotic and remote

27
00:04:00,174 --> 00:04:02,207
how about Karakalpakstan?

28
00:04:03,077 --> 00:04:06,945
It's an independent
republic within Uzbekistan.

29
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,483
In order to go there you
have to cross this enormous

30
00:04:11,485 --> 00:04:14,786
desert where there's
nothing but camels to see

31
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:18,056
and fly infested truck
stops once in a while

32
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,424
along the road.

33
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:47,152
The principle city in
Karakalpakstan is Nukus.

34
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:54,760
I had, I guess, assumed
that the Nukus museum

35
00:04:54,762 --> 00:04:58,597
would be to museums in
the world what Nukus

36
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,898
is to the world.

37
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,835
Kind of a dusty,
provincial town.

38
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,040
It didn't take me more than
a few minutes of walking

39
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:11,810
around this museum
for my jaw to drop.

40
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:25,090
The fact that there's such
a collection in this place

41
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:27,926
and such a concentration
of art makes it

42
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:29,895
far more interesting
than if you would see the

43
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:33,298
same paintings in a series
of galleries in Germany

44
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,733
or in New York.

45
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,535
So, how did this happen?

46
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,420
Savitsky: I was born
into a life of privilege.

47
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,083
I even had a proper
governess imported

48
00:05:51,085 --> 00:05:52,384
from France.

49
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,123
The little girl with the
bow is me, groomed in

50
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,858
the high fashion of the times.

51
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:05,931
My father was a wealthy
lawyer, while my mother

52
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,899
spent her days
presiding over tea.

53
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:10,902
My brother went to
military school and I

54
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:13,805
was supposed to follow
in his footsteps and

55
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,207
serve the czar.

56
00:06:17,144 --> 00:06:18,864
But then the
revolution broke out.

57
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,347
Our life turned upside down.

58
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,351
We were no longer
the ruling class.

59
00:06:28,322 --> 00:06:30,255
One by one our friends
and relatives began

60
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:31,590
to disappear.

61
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:36,795
We had to hide our
aristocratic roots and

62
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:41,166
blend in with the proletariat
that were now in power.

63
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,938
I had to prove that I
was ideologically pure.

64
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:51,510
So, I took a working class
job as an electrician.

65
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,814
But I dreamed of
becoming an artist.

66
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:11,430
I got my opportunity
when I joined the famous.

67
00:07:11,432 --> 00:07:13,932
Khorezm Archeological
Expedition.

68
00:07:15,369 --> 00:07:18,303
It was the greatest dig
in Soviet central Asia,

69
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:20,338
as important as the discovery of.

70
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,542
Tutankhamun's Tomb or
the Treasure of Troy.

71
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,582
My job was to draw what
could not be photographed.

72
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:37,756
Here in the desert for the
first time I felt a wonderful

73
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,191
sense of freedom.

74
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,696
There was no one
in sight except for

75
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:48,300
tarantulas, scorpions
and archeologists.

76
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,604
An ancient civilization
lay buried in the sands

77
00:07:52,606 --> 00:07:54,639
of the desert near Nukus.

78
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,777
We were literally walking
on top of antiquities.

79
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,463
Savitsky: While everybody
slept during the

80
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:29,134
midday heat I painted.

81
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:34,039
The desert trains the eye
to be especially sensitive

82
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:37,175
to subtle and intense
variations in color.

83
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,249
It is the best school for
the painter who strives

84
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:49,187
to grasp the full power
of how color sounds.

85
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:31,296
Savitsky: If an artist's
of Falk's stature tells you

86
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:35,634
you're no good you know
you'll never be great.

87
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,482
Savitsky: I destroyed all
my works and cut my ties

88
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,983
to the art world.

89
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:57,155
I decided to return to the
desert and start a new life.

90
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:59,117
Marinika: I knew Savitsky
from my childhood.

91
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:04,022
My grandmother was always
full of irony when she

92
00:12:04,024 --> 00:12:07,125
saw Savitsky saying, "Oh,
again he came to ask for

93
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,760
this old stuff."

94
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:12,997
Savitsky: I discovered that
the folk artists of this

95
00:12:12,999 --> 00:12:17,035
small nation lost in
the sands had an amazing

96
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:19,871
sensitivity to
patterns and colors.

97
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,711
Marinika: This is the
classical costume of Karakalpak

98
00:12:26,713 --> 00:12:31,149
fiance', which is exactly
the same denim cloth that is

99
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:34,385
popular all over the
world now and Karakalpaks

100
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:38,790
were using this cloth for
more than three centuries.

101
00:12:55,809 --> 00:12:58,209
Stephen: When the
Soviets were in power

102
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:02,113
they felt that the ethnic
traditions of all these

103
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:05,950
nationalities in what
was then the Soviet south

104
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,685
should be repressed.

105
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:11,856
You shouldn't be
Karakalpaks or Uzbeks.

106
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:17,428
Then if you had traditional
clothing you should hide those.

107
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,997
You should get rid of those.

108
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,570
Savitsky saved a lot of that
stuff that might otherwise

109
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,305
have disappeared.

110
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,912
Marinika: I remember in
those days Savitsky was

111
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:38,983
called a rubbish man
because he was collecting

112
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:43,121
all these garbages people
thought, washing it

113
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:46,891
in garage and he was
telling fairy tale stories

114
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,728
about the beauty of those
old rags or costumes

115
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,230
that were everywhere.

116
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,035
Savitsky: These treasures
would remain forever in

117
00:13:57,037 --> 00:14:02,140
my garage unless I found
a way to get the local

118
00:14:02,142 --> 00:14:05,977
communist party boss to
go against party policy.

119
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,700
Savitsky: I finally
had my museum,

120
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:41,706
but as an artist I still
longed to see paintings.

121
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,145
Around that time I came
across an art catolog

122
00:15:47,147 --> 00:15:50,081
from the early days
of Soviet Uzbekistan.

123
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:16,407
Savitsky: I was surprised
that I had never heard

124
00:16:16,409 --> 00:16:17,909
of Volkov.

125
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:23,815
If a work so haunting had
fallen victim to censorship

126
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,917
what else was out there?

127
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:39,557
Savitsky: I traveled all
over Uzbekistan searching

128
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:43,127
for masterpieces that
the history of our times

129
00:17:43,129 --> 00:17:45,229
had condemned to obscurity.

130
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,442
I found a whole multinational
collective of artists.

131
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:02,847
Some were Uzbeks, others
came from distant parts

132
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,415
of the Soviet Union.

133
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,519
They came here after
the revolution.

134
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:12,156
For a brief period of
time in the 20s and 30s

135
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,859
they painted freely,

136
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,728
far away from the
Kremlin's censorship.

137
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:22,700
Uzbekistan became their
second motherland.

138
00:18:28,908 --> 00:18:31,275
Voiceover: I know about
the classical case

139
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:33,644
with the great French
artist Paul Gauguin

140
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:36,981
living like the natives
on the island of Tahiti.

141
00:18:39,085 --> 00:18:43,488
I got the idea of repeating
his experience with myself.

142
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:46,591
I started learning
the Uzbek language.

143
00:18:46,593 --> 00:18:49,927
Then I got from the
library the Koran.

144
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,763
Three months later,
I told my landlord

145
00:18:52,765 --> 00:18:55,399
that I would like
to convert to Islam.

146
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,636
My landlord was rather puzzled.

147
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,772
He couldn't understand
why would a Russian artist

148
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,241
convert to Islam.

149
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,576
I told him that
I liked the faith

150
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:09,013
and wanted to live
according to Muslim customs.

151
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:13,784
Marinika: Upon his conversion
he changed his name

152
00:19:13,786 --> 00:19:18,856
to Usto Mumin which in
Uzbek means faithful master.

153
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,628
He penetrated into this
culture very deeply.

154
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:26,230
He started oriental philosophy.

155
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,066
He was very keen on Sufism.

156
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,204
His art is synthesis
of Italian Renaissance,

157
00:19:33,206 --> 00:19:36,841
Russian icon painting
and oriental miniature.

158
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,263
Savitsky: The artists
strove to find the most

159
00:19:59,265 --> 00:20:03,568
contemporary methods
and forms to depict

160
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:06,204
the Uzbek people
and their culture.

161
00:20:13,947 --> 00:20:15,179
Stephen: So you began
to have a kind of

162
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:19,250
a cross fertilization
of one of the great

163
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:23,621
world class schools of art,
the Russian Avant Garde

164
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:27,225
with this other more
interesting locally based school

165
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:29,393
and the influences that
created the Russian

166
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,530
avant garde merged and
melded with the influences

167
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,865
that came out of central Asia.

168
00:20:49,816 --> 00:20:52,250
Marinika: Mikhail Kurzin
came also to Uzbekistan

169
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:54,819
in the beginning of 1920s.

170
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:59,890
If we look at his first
impressions of Uzbekistan

171
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:04,028
they are full of sarcasm,
irony, grotesque.

172
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:05,910
He was the master
of these things.

173
00:21:06,532 --> 00:21:09,233
So this was the new,
this is the old.

174
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:14,238
The old symbolized the
tradition of Islamic country

175
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,376
when man was allowed to
have up to four wives.

176
00:21:18,378 --> 00:21:21,545
We can see two wives
following their master,

177
00:21:21,981 --> 00:21:25,082
and they're wearing
veils paranjas.

178
00:21:29,155 --> 00:21:32,323
Sarcasm of Kurzin is in
the fact that the two

179
00:21:32,325 --> 00:21:36,093
traditional wives are
combined with the new Soviet

180
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:39,096
kind of wife in the
new clothes, in the

181
00:21:39,098 --> 00:21:40,698
new way of behaving.

182
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:48,673
Stephen: Part of the
revolution that Soviet rule

183
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:51,475
brought to central Asia was
the liberation of women.

184
00:22:43,663 --> 00:22:46,397
Stephen: Central Asia had
been stuck in a far distant

185
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:50,234
past and when the Soviets
arrived it was like a

186
00:22:50,236 --> 00:22:52,636
dawning of a huge new era.

187
00:22:52,638 --> 00:22:55,106
Life changed in every
way for the people

188
00:22:55,108 --> 00:22:56,140
that lived there.

189
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:37,608
Stephen: The Soviets
decided that they were going

190
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,978
to turn central Asia into
the region where all the

191
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,748
cotton for the entire
Soviet Union was going

192
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,950
to be produced.

193
00:24:50,857 --> 00:24:53,924
Cotton is a very water
intensive project, and so

194
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:57,828
the Soviets built a huge
network of extremely

195
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:02,333
inefficient irrigation
channels so that huge amounts

196
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:06,971
of water was just lost,
and they sucked this water

197
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,293
principally out of the rivers
that fed into the Aral Sea.

198
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,612
This was one of the
world's largest inland seas

199
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:17,314
and had been since
time in memorial.

200
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:19,216
It just dried up.

201
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:33,697
This Aral Sea disaster
is truly one of the great

202
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:38,235
environmental catastrophes
of the 20th century.

203
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:51,181
Savitsky: As I was walking
across the wasteland

204
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,651
of our Soviet dream,

205
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,623
I pitied Volkov
for his idealism.

206
00:26:22,214 --> 00:26:24,014
Male voiceover: The
artist Volkov, more than

207
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:27,318
anybody else, has gone astray.

208
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,688
Volkov doesn't see
anything but colors.

209
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:40,164
The audience saw
staring at them from

210
00:26:40,166 --> 00:26:44,034
the walls, roughly
sketched monsters,

211
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,571
a deliberate
distortion of reality.

212
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,974
Stephen: You had these
paintings of hardworking

213
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:06,710
peasants and factory
workers all of whom would

214
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,679
be very healthy and vibrant.

215
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:11,882
They were supposed to
convey the satisfaction

216
00:29:11,884 --> 00:29:14,952
and the thrill that people
felt being Soviet citizens.

217
00:29:26,766 --> 00:29:29,333
John: If an artist wished
to work outside the system

218
00:29:29,335 --> 00:29:32,603
of Soviet socialist
realism then that artist

219
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:37,674
would inevitably be
removed from that system

220
00:29:38,077 --> 00:29:41,578
like a microbe from
the healthy body.

221
00:29:46,152 --> 00:29:50,354
Yevgeny: In my dream
I saw a creature,

222
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:54,324
his eyes like the
barrels of a gun.

223
00:29:55,561 --> 00:30:00,464
I called the painting
"Fascism is Advancing."

224
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:16,113
Marinika: It was a kind
of a future vision of

225
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:19,149
the threat that was coming.

226
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,953
The fact that Lysenko
finished his life

227
00:30:22,955 --> 00:30:25,656
in mental hospital means a lot.

228
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:29,593
Many artists were forced to
be sent to mental hospitals.

229
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:38,635
Marinika: Savitsky was criticized
for this very painting

230
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:41,572
when it was hung on the
walls of the museum.

231
00:30:42,241 --> 00:30:44,675
The inspection came
and said you must take

232
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:47,444
away this anti Soviet work.

233
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,948
It's degenerate painting
so there is no place

234
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,649
for it in the museum.

235
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,594
Savitsky: Anti
Soviet? Of course.

236
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,122
Of course.

237
00:30:59,124 --> 00:31:00,724
Degenerate?

238
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,293
No way.

239
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:07,097
The next day after the
commission left I put it on

240
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:08,365
the wall again.

241
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:12,169
It was too great a
work of art to hide.

242
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,673
Marinika: Here is
another painting from our

243
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:19,176
collection done by Komarovsky.

244
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,478
He was studying icon painting.

245
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:31,822
Unfortunately his life was ended
during Stalin's repressions.

246
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,259
For the only reason
that he believed in God.

247
00:31:53,445 --> 00:31:56,146
Alexander Nikolaev
was also repressed.

248
00:31:56,515 --> 00:32:01,585
The reason was his nontraditional
sexual orientation.

249
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:04,521
John: He was arrested and
imprisoned

250
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:07,057
for homosexuality,
which was considered

251
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,092
to be a crime in
Stalin's Russia.

252
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:50,834
Marinika: Two years
ago, a new information

253
00:32:50,836 --> 00:32:53,203
about this painting came to us.

254
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:57,307
We realized that this was
only part of the painting,

255
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,343
made by Mikhail Kurzin.

256
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:02,145
And the whole painting
looks like this.

257
00:33:03,749 --> 00:33:06,683
So it was a big
discovery for us.

258
00:33:07,252 --> 00:33:08,752
Very unexpected.

259
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:13,724
We don't know who
cut the painting.

260
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:17,194
The photograph came
from the KGB archives,

261
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:22,499
and now we look at this
painting with new eyes.

262
00:33:25,371 --> 00:33:29,239
In Kurzin's caricature
of western capitalism

263
00:33:29,708 --> 00:33:32,476
the millionaires cradle
their symbols of power

264
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:36,246
against a background
of exploited workers.

265
00:33:38,117 --> 00:33:41,184
At first glance it's hard
to understand why the.

266
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:45,489
Soviet Secret Police
objected to this criticism

267
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:49,993
of capitalism, but as
you take a closer look.

268
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,230
Kurzin's workers bear
a striking resemblence

269
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,266
to the ones in
Stalin's labor camps.

270
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:59,236
They are the same slaves.

271
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:04,307
In Kurzin's vision of
socialism the workers crowd

272
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:07,110
a tunnel going nowhere.

273
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:14,017
You see the self portrait
of Kurzin holding a coffin.

274
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,021
So, this is annihilation
of hopes, of the dreams

275
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,590
of an artist in that society.

276
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:30,500
Male voiceover: November
16th, 1936, interrogation

277
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:34,171
of the defendant Mikhail
Ivanovich Kurzin.

278
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:39,109
Question: Tell the
investigator about your anti.

279
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:43,613
Soviet speech at the
exhibition of the artist Malt.

280
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:48,518
Answer: I don't remember
the matter of my

281
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,590
anti Soviet speech
because I was drunk.

282
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:12,742
Marinika: Mikhail Kurzin
tried to follow the Soviet

283
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:16,079
path, painting fake,
joyous peasants,

284
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:18,315
but he couldn't stand it.

285
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:22,486
He used to say that even
in the capitalist world

286
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:25,222
the artists are living
better than here.

287
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:30,527
Voiceover: From the
interrogation of the witness,

288
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:34,865
Alexander Nikolaevich
Volkov, encouraged to testify

289
00:35:34,867 --> 00:35:39,503
against his fellow
artist and friend Kurzin.

290
00:35:44,176 --> 00:35:46,676
"In conversations with
me Kurzin said that the.

291
00:35:46,678 --> 00:35:51,047
USSR doesn't allow freedom
of expression pointing

292
00:35:51,049 --> 00:35:54,151
out that there are greater
opportunities for artists'

293
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:57,587
creativity in
capitalist countries."

294
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:25,549
Male voiceover: Witness
Alexander Nicolaevich.

295
00:36:25,551 --> 00:36:29,553
Volkov, "I am convinced
that Kurzin is an

296
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:34,524
anti-Soviet artist and
human being, hostile

297
00:36:34,526 --> 00:36:39,596
to the Soviet rule and the
politics of the party."

298
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,807
Voiceover: From the
testimony of Mikhail.

299
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:28,878
Ivanovich Kurzin, "I
plead guilty that I being

300
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:35,485
drunk expressed my
anti-Soviet opinion and

301
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:40,924
said artists throw away
your brushes and palettes,

302
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:47,197
arm yourselves, attack the
Kremlin and kill Stalin."

303
00:38:05,584 --> 00:38:07,617
Marinika: We are speaking
so much about the

304
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,688
artists who were repressed
in Stalin's time,

305
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,691
all those terrible stories,
how they were sent to

306
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,861
gulags or somewhere
driven mad, but when we

307
00:38:17,863 --> 00:38:22,932
come to our own personal
life I realize that we also

308
00:38:24,202 --> 00:38:29,272
have very many tragic
stories around us.

309
00:38:34,246 --> 00:38:36,446
My father had a
very difficult life.

310
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:42,552
His father was shot in
1938 as the enemy of people

311
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:46,156
being the president of
Karakalpakstan and he

312
00:38:46,158 --> 00:38:50,160
just wanted his people
to blossom, to flourish.

313
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:59,996
Marinika: Nadezhda Borovaya
was sent to concentration

314
00:39:59,998 --> 00:40:04,100
camp as the wife of an
admiral who was repressed.

315
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:13,743
Even children were sent
to concentration camps.

316
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,579
To women's colonies.

317
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:27,457
Once in 1983 Savitsky
prepared a big portion

318
00:40:28,293 --> 00:40:31,361
of the works for the
attention of the commission

319
00:40:31,363 --> 00:40:33,563
from the Ministry of Culture.

320
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:37,667
He was to persuade them
to give money to the

321
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:41,104
museum so that he
could pay the owners.

322
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:47,010
One of the artists that
was put on the agenda was.

323
00:40:47,379 --> 00:40:49,612
Nadezhda Borovaya.

324
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:53,516
Savitsky was very tricky.

325
00:40:53,518 --> 00:40:57,353
He said that these were
Nazi concentration camps.

326
00:40:57,989 --> 00:41:01,124
Showing all those people
who had the drawings

327
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:03,293
with the numbers
on their foreheads

328
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:09,699
and terrible scenes of
lives of those prisoners.

329
00:41:11,536 --> 00:41:14,137
So the commission was persuaded.

330
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:17,207
They decided to pay money
to Nadezhda Borovaya

331
00:41:17,909 --> 00:41:20,510
and after the commission
went away Savitsky

332
00:41:20,512 --> 00:41:24,981
came to me and whispered
into my ear with a...

333
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:30,019
with a smile on his face
that these were Stalin's

334
00:41:30,021 --> 00:41:34,691
concentration camps
and I was so shocked.

335
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:43,066
I couldn't understand at
first what he was saying.

336
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:49,072
Then later I realized the extent
of danger he exposed himself.

337
00:41:56,047 --> 00:41:57,881
Savitsky: Borovaya's
works were unique visual

338
00:41:57,883 --> 00:41:59,983
evidence of the repressions.

339
00:42:03,121 --> 00:42:05,154
I had to make sure
that one day people

340
00:42:05,156 --> 00:42:06,389
could see them.

341
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:17,333
Marinika: My father was
invited to work for the.

342
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:21,304
Regional Communist
Party Department and he

343
00:42:21,306 --> 00:42:24,240
advised Savitsky to be careful.

344
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:26,209
My father was saying,
"Oh, one day you will

345
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:27,744
get into the jail."

346
00:42:27,979 --> 00:42:30,413
But Savitsky's
obsession was so strong

347
00:42:30,415 --> 00:42:32,081
he couldn't stop.

348
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:40,456
Savitsky: The Bolsheviks
were destroying our culture.

349
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,630
Nothing was sacred.

350
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:51,367
Centuries old treasures
were vanishing in front

351
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:52,735
of our eyes.

352
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,767
Savitsky: When I
discovered Alexei Rybnikov

353
00:45:38,103 --> 00:45:40,036
he was completely
unknown as a painter.

354
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,206
John: Rybnikov was a
very interesting man.

355
00:45:43,208 --> 00:45:46,109
He was very close to the
very major Avant-Gardists.

356
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,245
In fact, in doing exactly
what Kandinsky and Chagall

357
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,713
were doing at the same time.

358
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:53,983
Therefore, any museum
that has any piece by.

359
00:45:53,985 --> 00:45:55,718
Rybnikov is blessed.

360
00:45:57,689 --> 00:46:00,690
Savitksy: Rybnikov led a
secret life as an artist.

361
00:46:02,861 --> 00:46:04,994
He was a follower of
Natalia Goncharova.

362
00:46:06,831 --> 00:46:09,565
She was the most
famous female artist

363
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:11,334
of the Russian Avant-Garde.

364
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,138
Luckily for her she left Russia.

365
00:48:20,598 --> 00:48:22,965
Marinika: Savitsky
heard about this artist.

366
00:48:22,967 --> 00:48:26,569
Ural Tanskybaev who
was recognized by the

367
00:48:26,571 --> 00:48:29,639
regime as the master
of socialist realism.

368
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:32,341
He was awarded
many state prizes.

369
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:37,213
Savitsky: At first I didn't
want to go to Tanskybaev.

370
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:41,083
He was a fat cat, enjoying all

371
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:44,620
the perks of a people's
artist of the USSR.

372
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:49,091
In return he painted
what he was told.

373
00:48:54,198 --> 00:48:59,201
But then I discovered
that Tanskybaev had

374
00:48:59,203 --> 00:49:02,338
been one of Volkov's
favorite students.

375
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:20,022
Savitsky: So, I went
to Tanskybaev's studio.

376
00:49:22,026 --> 00:49:26,696
The works were boring,
but I saw immediately

377
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,399
the hand of someone
who knew how to paint.

378
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:35,604
He was a bit suspicious
of my motives until

379
00:49:35,606 --> 00:49:39,208
we found that we both
admired Uzbek folk culture.

380
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:48,751
He showed me watercolors
of village life that he'd

381
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,052
done as a young man.

382
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:55,891
I asked him if these
were all he had.

383
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,838
Marinika: Ural Tanskybaev
took Savitsky into the

384
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:13,376
attic, opened a big chest
and Savitsky couldn't

385
00:50:13,378 --> 00:50:14,844
believe his eyes.

386
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:29,358
Savitsky: I had stumbled
upon a world created

387
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,494
by the mind of a genius.

388
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:39,769
These works that hadn't
been exhibited for many

389
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:43,506
years shocked me with
their originality.

390
00:50:50,515 --> 00:50:54,350
Marinika: We can see his real
soul in his early paintings.

391
00:50:57,121 --> 00:50:58,788
Savitsky: He told me
how much he admired.

392
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:03,192
Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Seurat.

393
00:51:07,098 --> 00:51:09,899
But his subjects came
from the oriental culture

394
00:51:09,901 --> 00:51:11,400
around him.

395
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,150
Marinika: Tanskybaev said
you can take everything

396
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:31,787
what you like and you
can pay when you can.

397
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,749
Savitsky: I quickly took
every single work before.

398
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:02,651
Tanskybaev changed his mind.

399
00:52:06,958 --> 00:52:09,825
Marinika: Nukus was so far
away, far from political

400
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:13,596
cultural centers maybe
Tanskybaev thought

401
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,098
that who will see
these paintings there.

402
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,472
Marinika: Elena
Korovay was very much

403
00:54:03,474 --> 00:54:06,875
interested by the life
of Jews of Bukhara.

404
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:11,547
Not the fact that they
were isolated and living

405
00:54:11,549 --> 00:54:15,484
in ghettos, but she saw the
beauty of their occupation.

406
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:21,490
We can see wonderful
indigo colors of her dyers

407
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,161
or tailors of Bukhara,

408
00:54:31,569 --> 00:54:33,068
carpenters.

409
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:35,037
We have the whole
series of these works

410
00:54:35,039 --> 00:54:37,406
that were created by
her during her stay

411
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:38,774
in Uzbekistan.

412
00:56:41,932 --> 00:56:43,852
Marinika: Korovay
lived in poverty.

413
00:56:43,934 --> 00:56:46,535
She had a lot of
troubles and problems.

414
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,304
Savitsky took these
paintings from Elena.

415
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:51,940
Korovay herself
already in Moscow.

416
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:58,313
Elena: For me Karakalpaks
are invented creatures

417
00:56:58,315 --> 00:57:02,451
with their city Nukus
in a land far away.

418
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:08,390
And there's Savitsky with
the eyes of a hooligan,

419
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:12,294
persuading me that I am obliged

420
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:14,363
to donate to his museum.

421
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:21,770
He looks at the paintings,
attentively, meticulously.

422
00:57:23,073 --> 00:57:28,177
Examines them again and
again, at a distance

423
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:32,681
and up close, but
doesn't get tired.

424
00:57:34,285 --> 00:57:38,120
As any fanatic he
is boring, a little,

425
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:42,391
pretending to be interested
in what I have to say.

426
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,961
But I know the only thing
on his mind is getting

427
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,363
all my works for his museum.

428
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,711
Savitsky: I would leave
Moscow with piles of aging

429
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,047
canvases and boxes of drawings.

430
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:16,718
I was such a sight that
no taxi would stop for me.

431
00:59:18,255 --> 00:59:20,455
And the porters
grumbled when I appeared

432
00:59:20,457 --> 00:59:21,623
at the train station.

433
00:59:44,949 --> 00:59:48,350
Savitsky: I traveled across
mother Russia for three days,

434
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:55,958
until the train tracks ran out.

435
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:03,832
Then I'd camp out and wait
for a truck to transport

436
01:00:03,834 --> 01:00:07,869
me and my treasures across
the desert to Nukus.

437
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,646
John: It seems very
strange that he would have

438
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,315
such enough money to have
bought all the paintings

439
01:01:27,317 --> 01:01:29,651
that he bought, these are
thousands of paintings.

440
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:32,821
Yes, he had state
subsidies for his museum,

441
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:35,323
but those state subsidies
were meant to be used for

442
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:37,659
financing expeditions
into the desert,

443
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:40,595
not to be buying
silly Russian art.

444
01:02:12,196 --> 01:02:14,162
Savitsky: One can
find art anywhere.

445
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,132
All you have to do is look.

446
01:03:42,853 --> 01:03:46,555
Marinika: So, Savitsky
was grabbed by Dr. Efuni's

447
01:03:46,557 --> 01:03:50,125
staff and brought against
his will to Moscow to.

448
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:53,295
Efuni's hospital, and when
they checked his lungs

449
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:56,198
they understood that
this is the end.

450
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:23,391
Marinika: The whole
ward was given to this

451
01:04:23,393 --> 01:04:24,826
unusual patient.

452
01:04:25,229 --> 01:04:27,362
They even allowed
him to leave the ward

453
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:28,530
if he needed.

454
01:04:28,532 --> 01:04:32,868
So we know that Savitsky
managed to collect

455
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,905
two containers of paintings
and graphics while he

456
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:38,974
was staying in Efuni's hospital.

457
01:05:40,270 --> 01:05:43,171
Marinika: We use these
trays because the climate

458
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:45,106
is very dry in summer.

459
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:48,743
It can be plus 50 in the shadow.

460
01:05:49,346 --> 01:05:54,416
And we need some kind of
humidifiers for the paintings.

461
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:57,252
This does not help much
we know, but there is

462
01:05:57,254 --> 01:05:59,054
no way out at present.

463
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:01,790
That's why we are using
this primitive method

464
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:04,960
of putting vessels
with water everywhere.

465
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:09,197
When Savitsky came
to me and said,

466
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:13,501
"I want you to be director,"
I couldn't say no to him.

467
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:22,143
The Nukus museum has been
my life's work for 25 years.

468
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:27,248
I am the granddaughter
of the first president

469
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,783
of Karakalpakstan.

470
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,356
Karakalpakstan is a very
poor country and the

471
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:38,093
only treasure that it
has now is this museum.

472
01:06:39,429 --> 01:06:41,796
When Savitsky was
gathering this art that we

473
01:06:41,798 --> 01:06:46,701
have it was not accepted
by the communist regime.

474
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:51,906
Nowadays also we live
in a very complicated

475
01:06:51,908 --> 01:06:57,078
community, which
requires from us not only

476
01:06:57,080 --> 01:07:00,782
energy, not only strength
but also some kind

477
01:07:00,784 --> 01:07:05,820
of flexibility, with radical
Islam around us, nationalism.

478
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,761
Some people are more
progressive minded.

479
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:18,166
Some people look back
to the past and it's

480
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:22,904
very difficult to survive,
to preserve this collection

481
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:24,372
for the future.

482
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,708
Stephen: Central Asia is
really not a stable region,

483
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:30,879
and Uzbekistan is in
a very turbulent area.

484
01:07:30,881 --> 01:07:32,313
Of course it borders
on Afghanistan.

485
01:07:32,315 --> 01:07:34,249
Some of the same
trends that you see in.

486
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:36,785
Afghanistan have also
emerged in Uzbekistan.

487
01:07:37,521 --> 01:07:39,554
Marinika: Remembering
the events in Afghanistan

488
01:07:39,556 --> 01:07:44,626
when those radicals destroyed
Buddha statues in Bamiyan.

489
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:48,129
This means danger
for our collection.

490
01:07:53,370 --> 01:07:55,837
Stephen: The influence
of Islamic fundamentalism

491
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:57,439
could grow substantially.

492
01:07:58,275 --> 01:08:01,943
How that would affect a
collection of art that is

493
01:08:01,945 --> 01:08:06,147
abstract, modernistic and
that is run by a woman

494
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:08,416
could be a little
bit disturbing.

495
01:08:14,124 --> 01:08:18,259
Marinika: You can
see piles of canvases

496
01:08:18,261 --> 01:08:21,262
that are hanging like this.

497
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:28,303
They are real masterpieces
but they were never

498
01:08:28,305 --> 01:08:32,073
shown to anyone because
they need to be restored.

499
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:33,608
They need to be framed.

500
01:08:34,010 --> 01:08:36,044
When we look at these
wonderful paintings

501
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,714
we understand that people
are missing so much.

502
01:08:40,317 --> 01:08:42,884
They can't see all these
treasures, and we have

503
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:45,920
thousands of works like
this in our storages.

504
01:08:51,561 --> 01:08:54,696
Stephen: When I found this
museum story I realized

505
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:57,966
this could be a great piece
for our Sunday Arts page.

506
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:00,969
The Arts and Leisure section
of the New York Times

507
01:09:00,971 --> 01:09:04,439
has a unique place in
American intellectual life.

508
01:09:09,846 --> 01:09:12,814
When any story is given
huge prominence on

509
01:09:12,816 --> 01:09:14,782
the front page of that
section it's naturally

510
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:17,285
noticed in the cultural world.

511
01:09:17,888 --> 01:09:20,722
I realized that this was
going to be an exciting story.

512
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:22,157
There were going to be
a lot of people choking

513
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:23,725
on their English muffins
over breakfast on.

514
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:25,426
Sunday when they read this one.

515
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,970
Marinika: The collectors
from the west started

516
01:09:35,972 --> 01:09:40,175
to come in their private
planes, bringing bags

517
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:42,810
of money, showing this to us.

518
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:45,246
Of course they had
very good taste.

519
01:09:45,248 --> 01:09:47,515
We understood this immediately.

520
01:09:47,517 --> 01:09:50,585
They wanted the best pieces
and all the foreigners

521
01:09:50,587 --> 01:09:54,289
used to say, "Why don't you
sell one or two paintings?"

522
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:58,092
It was a tradition for
western museums to sell

523
01:09:58,094 --> 01:10:00,461
something from their
collection in order to

524
01:10:00,463 --> 01:10:02,130
settle their problems.

525
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:05,366
Remembering the
biographies of the artists,

526
01:10:05,368 --> 01:10:08,736
they were so unhappy during
their life they found

527
01:10:08,738 --> 01:10:12,774
shelter in Nukus and even
to think of selling them

528
01:10:12,776 --> 01:10:16,778
somewhere was very
difficult for us.

529
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:20,915
Stephen: I visited another
museum in another city

530
01:10:21,585 --> 01:10:26,554
full of artifacts from Uzbek
history, fantastic fabrics

531
01:10:27,123 --> 01:10:30,225
and weavings, suddenly
a guy came over to me

532
01:10:30,227 --> 01:10:32,260
and this was the
museum director.

533
01:10:32,696 --> 01:10:36,397
I pointed to a weaving and
I said this is a spectacular

534
01:10:36,399 --> 01:10:37,899
piece of art.

535
01:10:38,368 --> 01:10:40,649
And he looked at me and he
said, "You want to buy it?"

536
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:42,770
I said, "What?"

537
01:10:43,006 --> 01:10:45,707
He said, "You want to take it?
How much would you pay for it?"

538
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,675
So essentially what
he was saying is,

539
01:10:47,677 --> 01:10:49,944
"Come loot my museum."

540
01:10:51,982 --> 01:10:55,783
The idea that you'd be
an impoverished director

541
01:10:55,785 --> 01:10:58,886
of an impoverished museum
that had piles of stuff

542
01:10:58,888 --> 01:11:01,289
that it couldn't even
exhibit, but you wouldn't

543
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:06,094
sell a single piece must
have been unique to Marinika.

544
01:11:07,697 --> 01:11:11,499
Marinika: If we start
selling something some people

545
01:11:11,501 --> 01:11:16,070
would be interested in
selling the rest with official

546
01:11:16,072 --> 01:11:19,574
excuse of buying something
for the country in such

547
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:21,776
a difficult economic situation.

548
01:11:22,312 --> 01:11:24,846
For example, buying
tractors or some equipment

549
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:28,016
for the industry of our country.

550
01:13:33,143 --> 01:13:35,143
Marinika: After Mikhail
Kurzin was released

551
01:13:35,145 --> 01:13:37,478
he was already a
very ill person.

552
01:13:39,482 --> 01:13:41,516
He had no right for a job.

553
01:13:41,718 --> 01:13:43,451
He had no means for life.

554
01:13:44,254 --> 01:13:49,257
When we look at these
wonderful dumplings

555
01:13:52,996 --> 01:13:55,763
it's interesting that
the paintings were done

556
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:59,600
by the person who was
suffering from malnutriiton.

557
01:14:00,437 --> 01:14:04,405
He had suffered so much
and food was the only

558
01:14:04,407 --> 01:14:07,108
zone for him where
he could be free.

559
01:16:30,954 --> 01:16:34,055
Savitsky: I like to think
of our museum as a keeper

560
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,923
of the artist's souls.

561
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:45,433
Their works are the
physical expression of a

562
01:16:45,435 --> 01:16:49,203
collective vision that
could not be destroyed.
