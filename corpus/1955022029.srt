Nobody's around,

We need firewood!

65
00:03:25,306 --> 00:03:26,674
[Cameraman] You're

66
00:03:28,276 --> 00:03:29,677
What did you say?

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:30,944
[Cameraman] I said
you're an idiot.

68
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,580

(Dance music)

77
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:38,278
Ah, don't touch me you troll.

78
00:04:39,447 --> 00:04:41,649
[Cameraman] Oh

91
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,050
You wanna get wet?

92
00:06:24,785 --> 00:06:26,887
Surfing. Do you wanna surf?

93
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:29,757
I just...

94
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:33,026
I just wanna go home.

00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:42,803
Hey, where you going?

96
00:06:44,071 --> 00:06:45,739

00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,545
(Ominous music)

98
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,221
Good morning.

99
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,422
Mmm.

100
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,625
We should probably...

101
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,493

102
00:07:05,526 --> 00:07:06,727
(Groans)

103
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,469
Okay people, let's
get up and outta here.

104
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,571
No. Five more minutes.

105
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,941
(Kissing)

106
00:07:20,974 --> 00:07:23,611
Seriously? I
thought I was horny.

107
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:32,986
Marsha.

108
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,592

111
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:46,800
Shh!

112
00:08:01,214 --> 00:08:02,516
Ugh.

113
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,817
Marsha, I can
see your nipples.

114
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:04,885
I can see them.

115
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:06,119
Don't look at her nipples.

116
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:07,588
[Ronnie] Where's your top?

117
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,689
Dick.

118
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,658
You seen Heather?

119
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:11,725
Oh my god.

120
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,761
Gonna kill that bitch.

121
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:15,863
Oh shit, hold on.

122
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,798
(Vomiting)

123
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,135
(Sighs)

124
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,203
(Clapping)

125
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,805
That was amazing.

126
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,542
There were like
chunks and stuff.

127
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,143
She's probably
puking in your shoes.

128
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:31,579
Nice.

129
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,956
Are you stuck?

130
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:50,598
Oh my god.

131
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:54,868
Guys, I'm sick

132
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:56,269
None of this shit Marsha.

133
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,205
Come here and let's go.

134
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,047
Marsha, don't touch the sand!

135
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:12,219
The fuck?

136
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,089
Yeah, don't touch the sand!

137
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:20,794
(Gruting)

138
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:21,695
What is it?

139
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:23,797
I don't know! I'm stuck!

140
00:09:23,831 --> 00:09:25,599
Did she say she's stuck?

141
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,034
My feet, I can't...

142
00:09:29,937 --> 00:09:31,271
[Chanda] Marsha, just get up.

143
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,608
(Marsha screams)

144
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,780
Yo, is she okay?

145
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,716
(Crying)

146
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,117
She probably
stepped on something.

147
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,655
(Screaming)

148
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,224
Yo, something's wrong.

149
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,760
No Vance, don't!

150
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,095
[Vance] We have to help her!

151
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,097
[Ronnie] No Vance, you can't.

152
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,635
Get back in the...

153
00:10:01,669 --> 00:10:03,136
No Mitch, there's something
wrong with the sand.

154
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,405
- We have to help him!
- [Ronnie] Jonah do something!

155
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,907
[Jonah] Vance!

156
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,041
[Ronnie] You guys,
why isn't he getting up?

157
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:11,779
[Vance] Ronnie! Help, help me!

158
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:15,849
I'm going.

159
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:16,984
No!

160
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,118
Just let me go!

161
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:19,853
Oh it hurts!

162
00:10:19,887 --> 00:10:22,022
Goddamn it, do something!

163
00:10:22,055 --> 00:10:24,191
Start the car
Jonah, start the car.

164
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,859
- [Ronnie] It's gonna be okay!
- Come on!

165
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,227
It's gonna be okay Vance baby.

166
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,830
Look at me, look at me baby!

167
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,932
(Vance yelling)

168
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,901
Get a rope, get something,
just see what there is!

169
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:35,035
Alright.

170
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:38,338
Coming Vance, I got you bro!

171
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:39,907
Look at me baby! Look at me.

172
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:41,074
Shit.

173
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,044
I got it.

174
00:10:46,346 --> 00:10:47,280
He's sinking.

175
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:48,315
You will too!

176
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,083
(Yelling)

177
00:10:53,821 --> 00:10:56,957
Baby no! No, God!

178
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:05,332
(Screaming)

179
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,204
Oh my god, baby!

180
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:15,776
No! Please, please get up!

181
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,816
Please, this isn't real!

182
00:11:23,483 --> 00:11:24,818
Guys.

183
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,894
Fuck!

184
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:42,435
What the hell,
somebody wanna tell me

185
00:11:42,469 --> 00:11:43,837
What the fuck just happened?

186
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:45,305
You saw!

187
00:11:45,338 --> 00:11:47,474
It was quicksand, we need
to get out there and dig!

188
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:50,510
No! You saw the sand.

189
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,913
The sand ate him,
it devoured him!

190
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:54,147
It was chemicals.

191
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,448
What?

192
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,416
Chemicals, there was
a spill or something.

193
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:58,251
Like oil or something.

194
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:00,988
That's bullshit!
Oil does not do that!

195
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:02,756
Or the fucking Quick-e-lube guy

196
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,925
Would earn more than
fucking minimum wage!

197
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:07,094
It was the government!

198
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:11,331
So it was the government oil
chemicals that killed Vance.

199
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,333
Mystery solved!

200
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,868
Okay, what do we do?

201
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:17,871
I'm gonna call my
congressman, KCAL 9, 60 minutes!

202
00:12:17,905 --> 00:12:18,972
Give me my phone, call someone,

203
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:20,908
Let's get the fuck out of here!

204
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:21,942
(Crying)

205
00:12:21,975 --> 00:12:24,144
The phones are in the trunk.

206
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,979
Oh that's just great!

207
00:12:26,013 --> 00:12:27,881
How're we supposed to get them?

208
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,884
Vegas rules, you dick!

209
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:33,320
What kinda stupid
ass plan was that?

210
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:34,822
Take our phones away so we don't

211
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,857
End up on the fucking internet.

212
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,026
You see how played out that is?

213
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,493
God!

214
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:44,331
Guys, hey, hey, it's okay.

215
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,366
You know, we're okay.

216
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,568
The fuck we are, did you
see what just happened?

217
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,771
No, he's right. Look around.

218
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,574
We're okay.

219
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,344
Vance is in the fucking sand!

220
00:12:57,377 --> 00:12:59,980
Vance is gone, but we're okay!

221
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:01,348
And we're gonna
stay okay, right?

222
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,549
Right.

223
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:07,988
[Jonah] Okay, it
can't get us in the car.

224
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,522
We gotta stay in the car.

225
00:13:09,556 --> 00:13:11,424
Okay yeah, okay drive the
car over here and get us,

226
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:13,827
And we'll get outta here and
tell somebody about this,

227
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,562
And they can come
deal with this shit.

228
00:13:15,595 --> 00:13:18,198
The car won't start.

229
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:20,600
It's the battery. Jonah stop.

230
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,870
Lights. Turn the lights off.

231
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:28,541
(Engine grinding)

232
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,312
Dead battery.

233
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,083
It's okay, alright
then we wait here.

234
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:37,951
We're just gonna wait
here, someone's gonna come.

235
00:13:37,985 --> 00:13:40,187
Someone's bound to come
and come save us right?

236
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,955
Kaylee, what are you doing?

237
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:42,990
Kaylee!

238
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,157
Kaylee!

239
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:46,593
What are you doing,
are you crazy?

240
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:48,195
No just look, listen to me.

241
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:49,529
The sand you can't!

242
00:13:49,562 --> 00:13:52,065
Okay, just, please,
shut up for a second

243
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,134
And pay attention to this.

244
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:56,469
Kaylee.

245
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:58,071
Just... watch.

246
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,877
(Dramatic music)

247
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:28,468
Assholes!

248
00:14:28,501 --> 00:14:29,970
Get me out of here!

249
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:30,904
[Mitch] No, stop!

250
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,039
Come on you assholes! Help me!

251
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:33,406
Gilbert you have
to listen to me.

252
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,942
Screw you!

253
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,243
Gilbert, stop!

254
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:37,377
Is this you Mitch?

255
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,578
Gilbert look at me.

256
00:14:38,611 --> 00:14:41,614
You better start running,
consider this a head start.

257
00:14:41,648 --> 00:14:42,782
Gilbert, don't move!

258
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,484
- [Chanda] Gilbert stop!
- This is not a joke, man!

259
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:47,554
(All yelling)

260
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:49,957
I'm jammed in a fucking
trashcan, asshole.

261
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,258
Help me out of here.

262
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:53,626
Gilbert, you have
to listen to me.

263
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,895
(Heavy breathing)

264
00:14:58,265 --> 00:14:59,532
What is it?

265
00:14:59,566 --> 00:15:00,968
There's something in the sand.

266
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,403
What?

267
00:15:03,436 --> 00:15:04,671
[Mitch] I dunno,
we don't know.

268
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,273
[Kaylee] Vance is dead!

269
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,274
[Gilbert] Dead?

270
00:15:07,307 --> 00:15:08,976
Marsha too.

271
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,143
[Gilbert] Who?

272
00:15:10,177 --> 00:15:13,080
You know her, the girl with
the... the feet like a...

273
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,447
That's not funny.

274
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:16,216
What we know is you
can't touch the sand.

275
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:19,486
Yeah man, there's something
in it, like little hairs.

276
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,988
Little hairs?

277
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,688
Yeah.

278
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,223
What am I supposed to do?

279
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,657
You're supposed to sit tight.

280
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:25,525
Sit tight?

281
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:28,028
I'm jammed in a fucking
trash can Mitch!

282
00:15:28,061 --> 00:15:30,697
It hurts dude, it really hurts!

283
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:32,932
Listen, you have to, okay?

284
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,236
You guys are fucking with me.

285
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,505
Dude, Gilbert, please.

286
00:15:38,538 --> 00:15:39,606
Gilbert, listen to me!

287
00:15:39,639 --> 00:15:40,740
I'm listening!

288
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,342
Okay, the tide's coming in.

289
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:44,777
Yeah, in about two hours dude,

290
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:46,613
That tide's gonna be
right up next to you okay?

291
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:48,715
Can you wait that long?

292
00:15:48,748 --> 00:15:49,916
It hurts Mitch.

293
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,986
Just hang in there okay?
Get some rest or somthing.

294
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,636
Just let her go.

295
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:12,005
It's nice she found someone.

296
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:18,745
(Somber music)

297
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:33,193
What do you want from me?

298
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:35,695
The same thing
you wanted from me.

299
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:40,033
Doesn't sound so bad when
I put it that way, does it?

300
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,172
It doesn't matter anymore.

301
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:59,052
(Squishing noises)

302
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:06,393
The tide is coming
in? Why'd you say that?

303
00:17:07,594 --> 00:17:10,097
Do you think it makes
Gilbert feel any better?

304
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:14,033
Being stuck in a Goddamn
trashcan without any hope?

305
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:23,676
(Waves breaking)

306
00:19:15,555 --> 00:19:17,690
What happened last night?

307
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,459
Nothing.

308
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,229
We had a few drinks, we talked.

309
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,297
Then nothing happened.

310
00:19:24,331 --> 00:19:28,535
Yeah, we walked down the
beach and talked. Then what?

311
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:32,439
I don't know, I mean,
you weren't handling

312
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:33,740
The Jonah and Chanda show.

313
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,742
So we talked about,
like, friends.

314
00:19:36,709 --> 00:19:38,378
Came back in here and crashed.

315
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,780
And that's about it.

316
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:44,751
If we'd fucked, I'd know,
I'm talking about the sand.

317
00:19:45,885 --> 00:19:47,320
What's different?

318
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:48,655
Why could we walk
on it last night,

319
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:50,557
What happened
between then and now?

320
00:20:05,838 --> 00:20:07,740
Hey! Found this!

321
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,243
Oh great, we've only
been out here for hours.

322
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:12,779
You've got a good base
Chanda, you'll be fine.

323
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,814
That's great, I'm right here.

324
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,720
What happened last night?

325
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,290
The fucking sand killed
my boyfriend is what.

326
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:26,459
Okay, how, when, what
changed, what happened?

327
00:20:26,493 --> 00:20:28,795
Who cares! Get me out of here!

328
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:31,398
Yeah, Gilbert's
right, does it matter?

329
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,799
Yeah, it does.

330
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:34,367
If we can figure
out what happened,

331
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:36,303
Then maybe we can figure...

332
00:20:36,336 --> 00:20:38,871
Maybe we can what? Do my back.

333
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:41,608
Maybe we can figure
out how to get out.

334
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,378
We were all here
last night, camped out,

335
00:20:45,412 --> 00:20:49,349
Everyone was fine,
everyone crashed out.

336
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:50,650
Oh god.

337
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:54,821
What?

338
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:59,726
(Ominous music)

339
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,564
Not everyone?

340
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:06,866
It got everyone.

341
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,402
Everyone?

342
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:19,879
(Crying)

343
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,013
Oh my god.

344
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:40,667
No way! Bullshit!

345
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,768
This is a prank.

346
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:44,371
I'm gonna fuck you guys
up when I get outta here.

347
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:48,475
I'm gonna fuck yous up!
Get me out, get me out!

348
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:50,710
Gil, Gil, just chill
out for a second man.

349
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,882
It's so fucking
hot. I'm burning.

350
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:59,886
I know, I know, calm
down, let me help you.

351
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,554
I gotta get outta here.

352
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:02,855
I gotta get outta here.

353
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:04,624
Gilbert, no no no,
wait wait wait wait,

354
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:07,394
We got sunblock, man,
okay, it'll help.

355
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,329
Sunblock? Fucking sunblock?

356
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,999
Look, sunblock's what I
got okay? Do you want it?

357
00:22:13,032 --> 00:22:14,901
It's too far, you're
not gonna make that.

358
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,604
Jonah, you can make it.

359
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:20,907
Let me try.

360
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:29,849
Oh! Son of a...

361
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,818
Good job Jonah.

362
00:22:33,953 --> 00:22:36,789
Thank you, thank you so much.

363
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,740
Oh, it's so good.

364
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:01,113
(Ominous music)

365
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,149
What?

366
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:04,484
Do you see?

367
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,519
You guys, what is that?

368
00:23:16,463 --> 00:23:19,432
Me and Vance found
it, up the beach.

369
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,437
What is it?

370
00:23:24,471 --> 00:23:25,605
It wasn't cracked last night,

371
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:26,939
I actually almost
tripped over it.

372
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,208
It's almost like it...

373
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,409
Hatched.

374
00:23:31,544 --> 00:23:33,946
It hatched? It's an egg?

375
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:37,884
Like a monster?

376
00:23:37,917 --> 00:23:39,919
Holy shit, I
think she's right.

377
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:44,190
It's under the beach,
it's under the sand.

378
00:23:47,026 --> 00:23:48,761
I don't believe in monsters.

379
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:50,830
Yeah, I don't know
about monsters but...

380
00:23:51,664 --> 00:23:52,765
It is a fucking egg.

381
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,200
What? So it's alive?

382
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,571
Alive?

383
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,972
I mean, it has to be.

384
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,474
Alive?

385
00:24:01,508 --> 00:24:04,243
Guys! Get me out of here!

386
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,978
Get me out of here!

387
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,914
Listen Gilbert, if...

388
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,550
Okay, if it just
hatched last night then

389
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:12,919
How big could it be, right?

390
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,086
Right.

391
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,823
There's gotta be a size
to it, it can't be that big.

392
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:17,990
There's gotta be a shape.

393
00:24:18,891 --> 00:24:20,827
I've got an idea, just wait.

394
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,002
Starving.

395
00:24:30,036 --> 00:24:31,938
Okay, okay.

396
00:24:46,085 --> 00:24:48,721
(Ominous music)

397
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,569
What are you doing?

398
00:25:02,602 --> 00:25:03,803
I'm trying to
see how big it is.

399
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,239
Who cares? It's all around us.

400
00:25:07,273 --> 00:25:09,642
No, maybe, maybe not.

401
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,643
That's good thinking.

402
00:25:10,677 --> 00:25:12,879
Is it? How long are we
gonna be stuck out here?

403
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,615
And you're throwing
out our only food?

404
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,258
Here, let me try.

405
00:25:40,973 --> 00:25:42,341
God I'm so... give
me another one.

406
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,143
- Just try the other way.
- Give me another one.

407
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:51,550
You got hotdogs Mitch?

408
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:54,253
What the hell, you gonna
feed the freakin bird

409
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:55,722
But you ain't
gonna feed Gilbert?

410
00:25:55,755 --> 00:25:56,923
What the fuck?

411
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,025
Throw me a hotdog, a
drink, or somethin man!

412
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,794
I'm dying over here.

413
00:26:01,828 --> 00:26:03,329
You having a
motherfucking picnic,

414
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,798
And I'm over here starving,
give me a fucking hotdog!

415
00:26:05,832 --> 00:26:07,900
(Bird screeching)

416
00:26:07,934 --> 00:26:09,769
What the fuck?

417
00:26:09,802 --> 00:26:12,639
Guys! Guys, you see this shit?

418
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,742
This fucking sand is
eating this fucking bird!

419
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,177
That's the shit that
happened to Vance?

420
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:20,212
Fucking Duck Feet?

421
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,214
We're all gonna die, man!

422
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,718
This shit is crazy, we're
all gonna fucking die!

423
00:26:25,752 --> 00:26:27,319
Hold, just hold on.

424
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:30,389
My momma told me not to bring

425
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,391
My black ass to this
motherfuckin beach.

426
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:33,926
Try the other way.

427
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,601
What the fuck?

428
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:06,926
The fuck?

429
00:27:10,997 --> 00:27:12,832
That's it.

430
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,934
Right? That's it.

431
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:15,868
That's how far it is.

432
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:16,869
Yes!

433
00:27:16,903 --> 00:27:17,870
Oh my god.

434
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:18,705
(Laughing)

435
00:27:18,738 --> 00:27:19,305
Yes!

436
00:27:19,338 --> 00:27:20,707
You guys, that's it!

437
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,808
Yes!

438
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:26,145
What does it matter? We
can't get from here to there.

439
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:28,848
No no no, it's,
it's not so far,

440
00:27:28,881 --> 00:27:30,182
We can figure something out.

441
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:31,918
- No no no,
- [Jonah] Find a way to...

442
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:33,820
It is too far.

443
00:27:33,853 --> 00:27:35,187
It's too dangerous.

444
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,023
We'll just, we'll sit
tight, we'll be okay.

445
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:38,257
Someone will come.

446
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,027
No they won't.
It's spring break.

447
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,461
Where are you supposed to be?

448
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:45,765
I'm supposed to be going to
Cabo in like three hours.

449
00:27:45,798 --> 00:27:48,868
No one's gonna come looking
for me for like two weeks.

450
00:27:48,901 --> 00:27:50,402
Okay, no, but it's a beach.

451
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:53,139
People will come.

452
00:27:53,172 --> 00:27:57,476
No one else is here. No
one's come here for hours.

453
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,379
What if they can't? What if...

454
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,248
What if every
beach is like this?

455
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:06,085
What if it's all like this?
Every beach, everywhere?

456
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,293
There was...
Matt's sleeping bag,

457
00:28:15,795 --> 00:28:18,030
Nate, Sandy was...

458
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:21,133
No one's come looking for them!

459
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:24,470
Not a single person.

460
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,240
Ronnie's right.

461
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:31,377
There's not been
a boat, or a car.

462
00:28:32,945 --> 00:28:33,946
We don't know if she's right.

463
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,314
You don't know she's wrong.

464
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,059
Okay, you know
what, screw this.

465
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:48,861
[Chanda] Jonah, Jonah.

466
00:28:48,895 --> 00:28:50,797
No, I'm not gonna
let us just sit around.

467
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,965
Jonah you're being stupid.

468
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:54,066
What are you doing?

469
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,901
It's not as stupid as
sitting around doing nothing.

470
00:28:54,934 --> 00:28:56,168
Take this.

471
00:28:56,202 --> 00:28:57,804
[Kaylee] Just be careful.

472
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,908
- Oh shit. Oh shit, Jonah!
- [Chanda] Jonah.

473
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,142
Jonah!

474
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,948
Babe.

475
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:16,956
- [Mitch] Dude.
- [Ronnie] No, don't, don't!

476
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,524
Jonah.

477
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:22,261
(All yelling)

478
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,398
It's okay. Okay.

479
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,049
No, no, wait wait!

480
00:29:43,082 --> 00:29:45,051
The fingers, fingers.

481
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:49,421
Nice job babe.

482
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,060
[Kaylee] Careful Jonah!

483
00:29:56,528 --> 00:29:58,965
Hey Kaylee, we need to talk.

484
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,234
Sure your mouth
isn't too busy?

485
00:30:02,268 --> 00:30:03,870
Get over it.

486
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:10,943
That's what
you're bitter about?

487
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:13,179
Well, it seems like you had
a pretty good night yourself.

488
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,413
Come on dude.

489
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,216
What?

490
00:30:17,249 --> 00:30:19,385
Wanna say somthin?

491
00:30:19,418 --> 00:30:22,154
No, it's for later.

492
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:25,091
No man! There is no later!

493
00:30:25,124 --> 00:30:26,558
Not today.

494
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:31,530
Why don't you ask Vance
how later's going for him?

495
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,367
Or Duck Feet?

496
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:36,535
Marsha.

497
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,505
Whatever.

498
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:42,074
Or all the other people
that left the party early?

499
00:30:42,108 --> 00:30:43,542
Dude, you're being a dick.

500
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:44,510
Am I?

501
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:47,246
Well I'm not alone.

502
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,514
Shit head.

503
00:30:54,921 --> 00:30:58,057
Can you possibly cut
the fuckin bullshit?

504
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:00,059
I'm dyin' here.

505
00:31:05,031 --> 00:31:06,865
Yeah. Walk away.

506
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:18,344
[Kaylee] Jonah, Jonah.

507
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,946
No no no, it's okay,
the board just shifted.

508
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:24,583
(Grunting)

509
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,052
Hey, hey!

510
00:31:26,085 --> 00:31:27,686
I'm okay, I'm okay.

511
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,454
Look!

512
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,056
They're moving!

513
00:31:35,127 --> 00:31:37,329
Jonah, the sand is
moving the boards, okay?

514
00:31:37,363 --> 00:31:39,031
You just have to come back.

515
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:43,235
Baby, please, come back.

516
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:44,603
Hold on!

517
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:51,643
[Chanda] Jonah!

518
00:31:51,677 --> 00:31:53,045
(Yelling)

519
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,380
[Kaylee] Get up Jonah!

520
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,485
Jonah!

521
00:31:59,518 --> 00:32:02,654
(Yelling)

522
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,924
No!

523
00:32:12,198 --> 00:32:13,532
Jonah?

524
00:32:16,135 --> 00:32:19,038
(Gasping)

525
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,941
I'm okay. I'm okay.

526
00:32:25,211 --> 00:32:27,079
Jonah, talk to us!

527
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,085
(Groaning)

528
00:32:34,486 --> 00:32:36,088
It doesn't...

529
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:37,990
Baby!

530
00:32:38,024 --> 00:32:39,158
Jonah!

531
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,094
(Heart pounding)

532
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:43,329
Jonah!

533
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,964
[Chanda] Jonah look at me!

534
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,035
Can you hear me?

535
00:32:49,068 --> 00:32:51,237
[Mitch] Jonah. Jonah?

536
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:55,374
(Heart pounding)

537
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:07,253
(Yelling)

538
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,522
Jonah.

539
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,361
Oh fuck, that really hurts.

540
00:33:15,394 --> 00:33:17,996
(Yelling)

541
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,702
Oh fuck, it really really hurts.

542
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,372
It's like a
jellyfish times 1000.

543
00:33:26,405 --> 00:33:27,773
Do something, help him!

544
00:33:27,806 --> 00:33:29,175
I don't know what to do.

545
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:32,044
Somebody tell me what
the fuck is goin on!

546
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:33,612
(Yelling)

547
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:35,281
- It's poison.
- What?

548
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,782
It's poison.

549
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,785
That's why it hurts so bad,
because he barely touched it.

550
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:43,455
(Grunting)

551
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:48,460
(Groaning)

552
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:53,399
Look at me Jonah.

553
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:58,437
You're okay. You're okay babe.

554
00:34:00,206 --> 00:34:05,177
I'm okay. I'm okay.

555
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,647
Oh, that'll wake you
up in the morning.

556
00:34:11,317 --> 00:34:13,552
(Panting)

557
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,825
Babe? What is it?

558
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:24,230
Good news guys.

559
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,667
(Dramtic music)

560
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,236
Oh shit.

561
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,803
[Kaylee] Jonah!

562
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,510
[Mitch] Jonah, what
are you doing? Hey!

563
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,590
Hey, hey Jonah!
What are you doing?

564
00:34:56,662 --> 00:34:57,763
Babe!

565
00:34:58,697 --> 00:34:59,831
Dude.

566
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:11,143
It's the fire.

567
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:12,411
Fire.

568
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:18,650
(Gasping)

569
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:35,201
[Kaylee] Oh my god,
Jonah, your stomach!

570
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:37,836
(Ominous music)

571
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,342
Jonah.

572
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:44,876
(Vomits)

573
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,685
(Yells)

574
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:57,289
Jonah.

575
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,827
You need to get on that table.

576
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,866
We all told you not to do it,
but now you're over there,

577
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:09,335
And you're gonna make
the most of it okay?

578
00:36:09,368 --> 00:36:10,836
So get on that table.

579
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:21,213
(Yelling)

580
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:22,614
Oh, I gotta sit down.

581
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:24,416
No.

582
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,951
(Panting)

583
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:27,653
I'm tired.

584
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,621
You've done a good job so
far, but your job is not done.

585
00:36:29,655 --> 00:36:30,522
You need to look
through that bag,

586
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:32,458
Tell me what you've got.

587
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43,335
(Groaning)

588
00:36:50,676 --> 00:36:53,779
Well, it's a party
you guys. We got mixers.

589
00:36:54,846 --> 00:36:55,914
That's good.

590
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,221
(Yells)

591
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:22,808
This one's for my
main man. Gilbert!

592
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,283
Thank god man, you couldn't
of did this any sooner?

593
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,336
This good?

594
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,305
You first, okay.

595
00:37:54,873 --> 00:37:56,608
I'm not so thirsty.

596
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,515
(Yells)

597
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:05,417
(Wood cracking)

598
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:07,419
(Screams)

599
00:38:07,453 --> 00:38:09,588
(Yelling)

600
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:12,824
Oh!

601
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:15,427
(Yelling)

602
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:19,898
(Wet snapping sounds)

603
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,023
Look at me. You need
to get on that table.

604
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,598
(Yells)

605
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,798
- Oh shit.
- Look.

606
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,033
They're moving.

607
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,001
They're still moving.

608
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,905
God, this is what it does!

609
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:37,909
It just sits and it waits
for food to wander onto it.

610
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,580
Why would it leave anything
for us to stand on?

611
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:47,586
Look. That's the edge of it.

612
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,856
All we have to do is get
there and we're free.

613
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,629
(Whipping noise)

614
00:39:58,664 --> 00:39:59,865
What? What is it?

615
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,103
The tires. It's
growing up the tires.

616
00:40:08,474 --> 00:40:09,608
We gotta do something,

617
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:11,209
We can't just sit
here and wait it out

618
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,178
Jonah's dying.

619
00:40:13,211 --> 00:40:15,781
So is Gilbert.

620
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,683
We're next.

621
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,084
What can I do?

622
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:21,119
You see? You see that?

623
00:40:21,152 --> 00:40:23,922
It might as well be miles away.

624
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,725
We can't just sit here
waiting to die, there's gotta...

625
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:27,993
There's gotta be what?

626
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:29,861
The phones! The phones!

627
00:40:29,895 --> 00:40:31,196
Where'd you put the phones?

628
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,998
They're in the trunk.

629
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:34,733
[Kaylee] They're
all in the trunk.

630
00:40:42,974 --> 00:40:45,010
Chanda.
[Chanda] What?

631
00:40:45,043 --> 00:40:47,012
There's isn't a release,
you have to use the keys.

632
00:40:48,614 --> 00:40:49,748
What are you doing?

633
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:52,217
In my mom's car, you can
pull the back seats down

634
00:40:52,250 --> 00:40:54,019
And get to the trunk.

635
00:40:58,156 --> 00:41:00,826
[Chanda] Does the
back seat come down?

636
00:41:00,859 --> 00:41:02,961
I never did that with Jonah.

637
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,001
I think I can stand
on the bumper.

638
00:41:10,035 --> 00:41:11,169
Ronnie, no, you'll fall!

639
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,270
No I won't! I got this!

640
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,205
Give me the keys!

641
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,775
(Ominous music)

642
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,680
(Yells)

643
00:41:21,713 --> 00:41:22,814
It's hot!

644
00:41:33,992 --> 00:41:35,927
Good, this might work.

645
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,197
Oh my god, hot.

646
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:43,735
Chanda?

647
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:45,737
What?

648
00:41:46,805 --> 00:41:49,074
It might not work,
I wrote a letter.

649
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:52,844
It's for my mom. Just some
stuff I needed to say.

650
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:53,912
If I don't make it then I...

651
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55,180
Stop!

652
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,148
Ronnie, it's bad luck.

653
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,819
Please just give it to her.

654
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:04,089
Promise.

655
00:42:04,122 --> 00:42:05,724
[Chanda] Stop.

656
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,862
Turn around.

657
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,798
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

658
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,166
Okay, go.

659
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:29,047
(Breathing heavily)

660
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,953
Guys, I think I can do this.

661
00:42:34,986 --> 00:42:37,022
Throw away your damn letter.

662
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:41,226
Gilbert?

663
00:42:42,694 --> 00:42:44,963
Gilbert, how are you doin?

664
00:42:45,764 --> 00:42:47,899
Fuck you! I'm dyin!

665
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:50,969
Jonah?

666
00:42:52,738 --> 00:42:53,772
Jonah?

667
00:42:55,140 --> 00:42:56,141
Jonah!

668
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,615
Alright, okay.

669
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:10,055
(Keys jingling)

670
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,056
I got it!

671
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,824
Be careful!

672
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:25,336
(Yells)

673
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:28,940
Sorry, sorry!

674
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:31,677
Sorry.

675
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,646
Okay, come on.

676
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:38,950
Don't move.

677
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:50,862
I got it.

678
00:43:50,896 --> 00:43:52,063
(Laughing)

679
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,033
It's hitting my shins!

680
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,669
(Dramatic music)

681
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:00,906
(Screams)
Woah.

682
00:44:00,939 --> 00:44:02,340
I don't know about that.

683
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:06,912
[Kaylee] She can't do it.

684
00:44:06,945 --> 00:44:08,079
[Chanda] What?

685
00:44:08,113 --> 00:44:09,280
She's not going
to be able to do it.

686
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:11,316
No, I don't
understand, it was open.

687
00:44:11,349 --> 00:44:12,784
That's because the trunk,

688
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:13,919
It swings really wide
when you open it.

689
00:44:13,952 --> 00:44:15,721
And she's not gonna have
anywhere to put her feet.

690
00:44:15,754 --> 00:44:17,022
Can't you lean back?

691
00:44:17,055 --> 00:44:18,890
Lean back? There's
nothing to hold onto.

692
00:44:18,924 --> 00:44:20,158
I'm gonna fucking fall.

693
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,927
Okay, no no no, here, here.

694
00:44:23,795 --> 00:44:26,064
Here hold it.

695
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,702
[Ronnie] Hold tight.

696
00:44:30,736 --> 00:44:31,970
I promise.

697
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:37,909
Okay.

698
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:39,945
Come on Ronnie.

699
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:42,247
You got this one.

700
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,083
(Ominous music)

701
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:59,264
I have an idea. The rescue hook.

702
00:45:01,066 --> 00:45:02,734
Hold on, okay?

703
00:45:19,317 --> 00:45:20,819
Take this.

704
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,456
Fuck.

705
00:45:27,993 --> 00:45:28,459
Got it.

706
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:31,930
Okay. Okay.

707
00:45:33,064 --> 00:45:33,464
Here.

708
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:34,432
Got you.

709
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:48,313
Need a little more.

710
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:49,247
Okay.

711
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:51,349
Okay.

712
00:45:51,382 --> 00:45:53,785
[Chanda] Hey, just lean back.

713
00:45:53,819 --> 00:45:55,053
Bitch I will.

714
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,054
(Tire blowing out)

715
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,356
(All yelling)

716
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,457
Oh my god.

717
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:00,792
You okay?

718
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,361
Got it?

719
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:04,495
Okay.

720
00:46:11,002 --> 00:46:12,370
I have to let go to get the key.

721
00:46:13,504 --> 00:46:14,472
Okay.

722
00:46:29,154 --> 00:46:30,555
Come on Ronnie.

723
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,357
You got it! Oh my god!

724
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,159
I can't believe you got it!

725
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:35,160
(Laughing)

726
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:37,462
I did it! I did it!

727
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:39,064
I can see them.

728
00:46:43,034 --> 00:46:44,369
(Horn honking)

729
00:46:44,402 --> 00:46:45,403
Ronnie!

730
00:46:45,436 --> 00:46:48,106
(Screaming)

731
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,107
Shit.

732
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,845
Help us!

733
00:46:53,879 --> 00:46:56,181
(All yelling)

734
00:46:58,083 --> 00:46:59,851
Come on over man.

735
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:01,352
Help!

736
00:47:01,386 --> 00:47:02,420
Help!

737
00:47:02,453 --> 00:47:04,189
[Gilbert] Come on man!

738
00:47:04,222 --> 00:47:06,925

00:47:11,596 --> 00:47:12,830

742
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:20,271
[Gilbert] What are

743
00:47:20,305 --> 00:47:21,439
[Mitch] You gotta help us!

744
00:47:21,472 --> 00:47:22,273
[Kaylee] Roll
your window down!

745
00:47:23,441 --> 00:47:25,010
(Window rolling down)

746
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,478
The hell you still doin here?

747
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:29,447
Beach is closed.

748
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,648
You need to listen to me!

749
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,451
You need to call for help,
there's something in the sand!

750
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:34,719
Something in the sand?

751
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:38,023
That's right,
there's something that
will tear you apart,

752
00:47:38,056 --> 00:47:41,026
You need to stay in your car
and you need to call for help.

753
00:47:41,059 --> 00:47:43,962
You need to call the
National fucking Guard, man!

754
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:46,064
Dude, you have to listen.

755
00:47:46,097 --> 00:47:48,333
Why is Fat Albert
in the trashcan?

756
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,568
Stay in your car,
man! Don't get out!

757
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:54,505
There's something alive
in the sand! And it kills!

758
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:55,640
She's right!

759
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,042
Who's holding?

760
00:47:57,075 --> 00:47:58,543
Look, I know what
it sounds like okay!

761
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:01,079
But, I wouldn't even
believe it myself,

762
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:03,481
But you, you have to.

763
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:06,484
Don't bullshit me, I know
when people are on drugs.

764
00:48:06,517 --> 00:48:08,053
Somebody's tweakin.

765
00:48:08,086 --> 00:48:10,321
Just stay in your car
and get on your radio.

766
00:48:10,355 --> 00:48:14,025
Call for backup, call
for lots of backup.

767
00:48:14,059 --> 00:48:15,360
Is he on drugs?

768
00:48:15,393 --> 00:48:16,294
No.

769
00:48:16,327 --> 00:48:19,064
Is he on Molly? Who has Molly?

770
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:22,433
Just stay in your car,
stay in and call for help.

771
00:48:25,336 --> 00:48:26,571
Oh my god, fuck it.

772
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:29,107
No no no no no!
Don't touch the sand!

773
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:31,609
(Screaming)

774
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:35,113
If I find one goddamn
marijuana cigarette,

775
00:48:36,047 --> 00:48:37,482
You're all going downtown.

776
00:48:39,184 --> 00:48:40,118
Fuck?

777
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,190
Oh my god, look at that.

778
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,994
You gotta just
listen to them, please.

779
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:51,229
My god. Is that pus?

780
00:48:52,663 --> 00:48:55,133
Nothing more
disgusting than pus.

781
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:57,368
Why isn't anything happening?

782
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:59,304
(Radio chatter)

783
00:49:03,074 --> 00:49:05,443
(Whipping sounds)

784
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:11,116
Jesus Christ. Man in the can.

785
00:49:13,318 --> 00:49:15,120
What's on your face, pal?

786
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:16,421
What?

787
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:18,556
You got a dick on your face.

788
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:21,959
Oh my god, what, your friends
drew a dick on your face?

789
00:49:23,194 --> 00:49:25,963
Ew, whoever did that's
a pretty good artist.

790
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:28,533
This is some weird ass shit.

791
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,570
This has gotta be
GHB. You on GHB?

792
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:36,174
Fuck. Please man, help me.

793
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:39,010
How should I get you out?

794
00:49:39,044 --> 00:49:41,546
(Grunting)

795
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:45,050
Jesus god, I'm gonna
call a forklift.

796
00:49:45,083 --> 00:49:46,384
Fuck you.

797
00:49:46,417 --> 00:49:47,585
Why are jammed in a...

798
00:49:47,618 --> 00:49:49,487
You look like a half

799
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,123
Yeah I got fucking legs man.

800
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:54,059
You look like a
fucking art exhibit.

801
00:49:55,393 --> 00:49:56,461
What?

802
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,029
This is embarrassing.

803
00:49:58,063 --> 00:49:59,397
I don't even... I'm tellin you,

804
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:01,566
I been on the beach patrol
23 years of my life.

805
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,602
This is fuckin way
worse than the lady

806
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,471
With a horseshoe
crab up her ass.

807
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,075
You're okay, someone's
coming, someone's coming.

808
00:50:11,109 --> 00:50:13,144
You're okay, you're okay.

809
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:15,813
What's her problem?

810
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,782
Well, her fingers got stuck.

811
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:19,784
Why aren't you helping?

812
00:50:19,817 --> 00:50:21,152
What is wrong with you?

813
00:50:21,186 --> 00:50:22,120
Please help us.

814
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,521
(Groaning)

815
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:26,091
Oh my god, Alright

816
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,593
They're jammed in there good.

817
00:50:28,626 --> 00:50:31,329
This is the weirdest day
on the beach in 20 years.

818
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,831
This guy's got a terrible case
of syphilis on his stomach,

819
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,700
You got can man over there,

820

00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:46,311
That's fine! Do that

824
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:49,247
Okay, call your
supervisors, whatever.

825
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:50,715
My supervisor?

826
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,752
I'm the supervisor.

827
00:50:57,122 --> 00:50:58,189
I'm the one in charge.

828
00:50:59,524 --> 00:51:02,560
Oh my god, it's his
shoes. Look at his feet.

829
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,795
You got somethin to say?

830
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:06,164
No sir.

831
00:51:06,197 --> 00:51:07,365
I wasn't talkin
to you blondie,

832
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,500
I was talking to your
little boyfriend.

833
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:10,835
He's not my boyfriend.

834
00:51:10,868 --> 00:51:13,438
He's not my boyfriend.
What are you, 12?

835
00:51:13,471 --> 00:51:15,306
Oh I'm sorry, I'm
talkin to the guy

836
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:17,542
That you're shaking up
with in a lifeguard stand.

837
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:20,111
What do you call it
now? Tinder connections?

838
00:51:20,145 --> 00:51:22,147
What, did he poke
you on Facebook?

839
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:23,581
Sir.

840
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,683
I'm sorry to insult your
sensitive female nature.

841
00:51:25,716 --> 00:51:27,285
What do you have to
say for yourself sir?

842
00:51:27,318 --> 00:51:29,254
Dude, listen, we just...

843
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:30,521
We think it's because
of your shoes,

844
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,523
That the, the sand's
not eating you.

845
00:51:32,557 --> 00:51:33,424
I think.

846
00:51:33,458 --> 00:51:34,692
Really?

847
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:36,261
[Kaylee] Two of our
friends died already.

848
00:51:36,294 --> 00:51:38,796
Two of your friends died,
where are their bodies?

849
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,565
[Kaylee] The sand ate them.

850
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:43,834
The sand ate them. And you
know what I did earlier today?

851
00:51:43,868 --> 00:51:46,771
I rode in here on my unicorn.

852
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,839
You need to
listen to us, okay?

853
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:50,708
I don't wanna
hear from you lady.

854
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:52,477
Enough, I can't even look
at you with your shorts.

855
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,845
I can't, it's like I'm
committing a crime.

856
00:51:54,879 --> 00:51:56,314
Please.

857
00:51:56,347 --> 00:51:58,183
I need you to come
down here right now.

858
00:51:58,216 --> 00:51:59,116
Fuck no.

859
00:52:00,385 --> 00:52:02,487
Come down here now.

860
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:03,854
Dude, we're not
comin down there.

861
00:52:03,888 --> 00:52:05,723
You're not comin down?

862
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:06,891
You wanna get sprayed?

863
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:11,596
Please, we're hurt, some
of us are sick, dying maybe.

864
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,797
And we really need your help,

865
00:52:12,830 --> 00:52:14,465
But we can not come
anywhere near that sand.

866
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:16,734
The hell you can't.

867
00:52:18,336 --> 00:52:19,470
I'm gonna come up.

868
00:52:19,504 --> 00:52:20,738
[Ronnie] Please,
just call somebody!

869
00:52:20,771 --> 00:52:22,873
Do not make me
use force ma'am.

870
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:25,610
Do not make me use force,
you coming down now?

871
00:52:25,643 --> 00:52:26,811
No!

872
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:28,579
Fine, get the spray.

873
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:29,914
God damn it!

874
00:52:29,947 --> 00:52:31,449
No don't touch the sand!

875
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,650
Ow!

876
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:42,193
What the hell?

877
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:44,662
Use the spray!

878
00:52:45,930 --> 00:52:47,532
Use the pepper spray!

879
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:49,867
(Dramatic music)

880
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:52,737
(Yelling)

881
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,173
Use the pepper spray!

882
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:04,315
It's working. It's working.

883
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:09,254
(All screaming)

884
00:53:09,287 --> 00:53:11,556
Shit. Oh god my arm!

885
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:13,591
Run!

886
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,360
My arm!

887
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:18,463
(Yelling)

888
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:21,599
No don't look, oh my god.

889
00:53:27,572 --> 00:53:29,340
Oh god, no.

890
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,009
(Yelling)

891
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,648
Help me.

892
00:53:37,682 --> 00:53:38,983
They're pulling me down.

893
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:40,318
Help me!

894
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,587
They're pull, pull...

895
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:46,424
(Groaning)

896
00:53:58,869 --> 00:54:01,839
Oh god, help me.
It's pulling me...

897
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,681
[Gilbert] What are
we gonna do now y'all?

898
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:12,450
This was our only chance!

899
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:14,852
We're fucked!

900
00:54:14,885 --> 00:54:16,887
We are fucked man!

901
00:54:19,657 --> 00:54:21,459
So what are we gonna do?

902
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:22,693
We're gettin outta here.

903
00:54:22,727 --> 00:54:23,661
[Chanda] Mitch, you
mind telling me how?

904
00:54:23,694 --> 00:54:26,030
Yeah. The shoes.

905
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,066
[Kaylee] What shoes?

906
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,635
These.

907
00:54:30,668 --> 00:54:31,869
Are you kidding?

908
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:32,970
[Kaylee] Those are
not gonna protect you.

909
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,071
You still got
those beach towels?

910
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,706
What are you gonna do?

911
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:37,942
Wrap my feet up. And I'm
gonna run my ass off this thing.

912
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:39,944
Okay, towels? Seriously?

913
00:54:40,811 --> 00:54:42,680
This thing's eating
through tires.

914
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:44,349
Yeah, and it's also
eating through wood.

915
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:46,451
Alright, sooner or later,
this thing's coming down.

916
00:54:47,051 --> 00:54:48,419
We gotta be gone.

917
00:54:49,387 --> 00:54:52,623
Guys! I'm fast,
I'm fast as shit!

918
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:56,594
I just need the towels to work
for a second and I got this.

919
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:57,995
I'm gonna wrap my feet up.

920
00:54:58,028 --> 00:54:59,730
I'm gonna spray my feet
down with the pepper spray.

921
00:54:59,764 --> 00:55:01,366
And I'm gonna make my move.

922
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:02,567
Go to the cars, come back,

923
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,901
We're getting the
fuck outta here.

924
00:55:03,934 --> 00:55:06,504
I think that's a
fuckin great idea, man!

925
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:07,872
Sounds awesome Mitch!

926
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,006
Throw me a towel.

927
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:09,840
This is too dangerous.

928
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,008
Throw me a towel.

929
00:55:14,845 --> 00:55:15,946
Here.

930
00:55:16,847 --> 00:55:18,916
Listen, Kaylee, I got this.

931
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,888
I'm gonna get us outta here.

932
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:25,956
Let's go.

933
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,058
Sorry.

934
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:32,497
Round two.

935
00:55:34,031 --> 00:55:36,901
(Wood cracking)
(All yelling)

936
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:38,836
Fuck

937
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:39,737
Oh shit.

938
00:55:39,770 --> 00:55:40,671
What happened to Mitch?

939
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:42,373
No. No, no!

940
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:44,108
Oh god, oh please!

941
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:47,445
Kaylee I can't feel anything!

942
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:49,514
(Screaming)

943
00:55:50,047 --> 00:55:53,150
Help me! You guys!

944
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,021
Please help, I can't
feel my body Kaylee!

945
00:55:58,489 --> 00:55:59,957
Help!

946
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,660
(Yelling)

947
00:56:03,661 --> 00:56:04,995
Help!

948
00:56:07,031 --> 00:56:08,799
Help you guys!

949
00:56:09,767 --> 00:56:11,602
A new day.

950
00:56:11,636 --> 00:56:14,905
(Dramatic music)

951
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:30,921
[Gilbert] Mitch!
Say somethin man!

952
00:56:30,955 --> 00:56:32,923
Say something!

953
00:56:37,027 --> 00:56:39,430
(Crying)

954
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:49,574
(Somber music)

955
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,907
I don't wanna die
with a dick on my face.

956
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,174
You're not going to.

957
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:25,610
[Gilbert] We're all gonna die!

958
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,478
No we're not!

959
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:28,779
Chanda?

960
00:57:30,848 --> 00:57:32,216
Snap out of it, okay?

961
00:57:32,249 --> 00:57:34,519
I need you right now to
get on the hood of the car!

962
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:36,487
Come on, let's go!

963
00:57:36,521 --> 00:57:37,788
This railing's coming for you,

964
00:57:37,822 --> 00:57:40,190
It's coming fast, I need
you to grab it okay?

965
00:57:42,727 --> 00:57:45,630
I'm gonna send this
one to you too, okay?

966
00:57:47,632 --> 00:57:48,599
Careful.

967
00:57:49,767 --> 00:57:51,969
You put it on the hood.

968
00:57:53,203 --> 00:57:55,906
(Grunting)

969
00:58:01,111 --> 00:58:03,881
The next one's coming your
way, you have to grab it,

970
00:58:03,914 --> 00:58:05,816
Are you ready, get it!

971
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,051
Careful!

972
00:58:21,999 --> 00:58:23,133
Nice job.

973
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,904
We're getting the
fuck outta here!

974
00:58:26,937 --> 00:58:28,105
How?

975
00:58:29,206 --> 00:58:30,975
Even if you have that spray,
what are you gonna do?

976
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:33,811
Not me, us.

977
00:58:33,844 --> 00:58:35,512
We are getting
outta here together.

978
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,849
What are you doing Kaylee?

979
00:58:42,186 --> 00:58:44,521
(Yelling)

980
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:49,660
Fuck!

981
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,229
That's for screwing
my boyfriend, bitch!

982
00:58:57,267 --> 00:58:58,603
We good?

983
00:58:58,636 --> 00:58:59,837
For now.

984
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:02,206
Chanda, did you just
get punched in yo face?

985
00:59:02,239 --> 00:59:03,140
(Laughing)

986
00:59:03,173 --> 00:59:04,108
Jonah.

987
00:59:05,843 --> 00:59:07,578
Jonah, I need you to look at me.

988
00:59:10,981 --> 00:59:11,949
Kaylee.

989
00:59:11,982 --> 00:59:12,983
Right here.

990
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,155
I'm sorry.

991
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,029
I didn't mean to
hurt you, I just...

992
00:59:28,833 --> 00:59:30,668
I love you.

993
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:32,136
I love you too.

994
00:59:39,143 --> 00:59:40,277
How you doin Gilbert?

995
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:41,712
Fuck you!

996
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:43,180
Listen, we're coming for you,

997
00:59:43,213 --> 00:59:45,082
But you're gonna need to
be able to move fast okay?

998
00:59:45,115 --> 00:59:46,917
Can you turn around
in there and face us

999
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:48,252
So you can see
what's up, alright?

1000
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:50,988
I can't.

1001
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:53,824
My legs and my back.

1002
00:59:53,858 --> 00:59:55,960
(Crying)

1003
00:59:55,993 --> 00:59:57,327
Just do it!

1004
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,668
Good speech. You
actually have a plan?

1005
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:05,169
How the fuck are we gonna
get all the way over there?

1006
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:06,737
One step at a time.

1007
01:00:06,771 --> 01:00:08,338
But first things first.

1008
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:14,011
You okay?

1009
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:19,149
I know it is.

1010
01:00:20,284 --> 01:00:22,119
We shoulda been
better friends.

1011
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:26,090
Three. Two.

1012
01:00:27,124 --> 01:00:30,194
Fuck! I can't do this!

1013
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:32,262
[Both] Suck it up!

1014
01:00:35,299 --> 01:00:37,434
Let's get this done.

1015
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,903
Okay.

1016
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,304
You're not goin out
like a little bitch.

1017
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:41,271
Okay.

1018
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,108
You can do this.

1019
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:46,877
Ready?

1020
01:00:46,911 --> 01:00:49,279
Pull it together.
Pull it together.

1021
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,048
On the count of...

1022
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:54,151
(Groaning)

1023
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:56,220
Three,

1024
01:00:57,187 --> 01:00:58,823
[Both] Two...

1025
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:02,126
(Screaming)

1026
01:01:03,861 --> 01:01:04,895
Hey, hey, hey.

1027
01:01:04,929 --> 01:01:07,031
You're okay, you're okay.
Come here, come here.

1028
01:01:07,064 --> 01:01:09,734
(Yelling)

1029
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,038
Look at me, look at me.
You're okay, you're okay.

1030
01:01:15,439 --> 01:01:17,274
Breathe, just breathe.

1031
01:01:17,307 --> 01:01:20,177
(Mumbling)

1032
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,247
(Crying)

1033
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,051
Heh.

1034
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,853
Gilbert.

1035
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:46,771
(Somber music)

1036
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:49,273
(Whipping noise)

1037
01:01:58,783 --> 01:02:00,951
You guys were
the perfect couple.

1038
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:05,856
Beautiful, smart.
Totally in love.

1039
01:02:07,091 --> 01:02:09,459
I think we all figured
you'd get married

1040
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:12,362
And start squirting out
a bunch of perfect kids.

1041
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,032
Yeah. Me too.

1042
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,403
You get scared?

1043
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:21,738
I have never
stopped loving him.

1044
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:25,275
Life's a long time.

1045
01:02:28,145 --> 01:02:29,914
Not always.

1046
01:02:38,956 --> 01:02:42,893
Okay. We're gonna
get to the fire pit.

1047
01:02:43,327 --> 01:02:45,863
We're gonna get Jonah,
we're gonna build a bridge

1048
01:02:45,896 --> 01:02:47,832
From there to the truck alright?

1049
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:49,199
Cool.

1050
01:02:49,233 --> 01:02:51,401
I rocked the balance
beam in eighth grade.

1051
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,008
Think it's long enough?

1052
01:02:58,042 --> 01:02:58,943
Yeah.

1053
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:01,378
Hey Gilbert, how ya doin?

1054
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:03,147
Don't worry about me.

1055
01:03:03,180 --> 01:03:06,516
(Dramatic music)

1056
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,103
The smart thing
would be to tell you

1057
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:28,538
That nothing
happened last night.

1058
01:03:30,074 --> 01:03:32,042
But I'm not even gonna
tell you I'm sorry.

1059
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:36,480
It's like you said,
life's a long time.

1060
01:03:37,882 --> 01:03:40,384
I wanted a fairytale, even
if it was just for a minute.

1061
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:43,520
Besides, you guys woulda
made up and got back together

1062
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:46,390
In a couple of days, and
I'm back to square one.

1063
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:51,996
Man-stealing bitch Chanda.

1064
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:57,201
Guys, seriously, do we really
need to talk about this now?

1065
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:05,109
[Jonah] Kaylee?

1066
01:04:05,142 --> 01:04:06,911
Chanda, what's goin
on? Is Jonah okay?

1067
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:10,414
Kaylee, you better
come here fast.

1068
01:04:18,088 --> 01:04:20,857
(Ominous music)

1069
01:04:22,226 --> 01:04:23,393
You first, alright?

1070
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:27,197
No, me dripping blood anywhere
near the sand is a problem.

1071
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:30,067
Go.

1072
01:04:30,667 --> 01:04:32,102
Okay.

1073
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:33,670
(Gilbert groaning)

1074
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,604
[Gilbert] Oh no.

1075
01:04:34,638 --> 01:04:36,273
What happened?

1076
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:39,143
I scraped my belly,
I'm fucking bleeding!

1077
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:44,048
It's cool, probably enough
sites of no feeling in my body.

1078
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,183
(Laughing)

1079
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,919
Don't worry about me.

1080
01:04:48,953 --> 01:04:50,087
It's nothin a good dose of

1081
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,322
Get me the fuck outta
here won't cure!

1082
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:14,278
(Somber music)

1083
01:05:17,181 --> 01:05:19,116
Please don't leave me.

1084
01:05:19,149 --> 01:05:20,517
I'm not going anywhere.

1085
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,594
[Chanda] Come on
Ronnie, you can do this.

1086
01:05:36,066 --> 01:05:37,434
There ya go, okay.

1087
01:05:37,467 --> 01:05:39,469
Slow. Slow and steady Ronnie.

1088
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:46,076
[Chanda] Come on, come on.

1089
01:05:50,047 --> 01:05:51,615
[Gilbert] You're almost there!

1090
01:05:56,186 --> 01:05:58,055
[Kaylee and Chanda] Come on.

1091
01:05:58,088 --> 01:05:59,456
[Kaylee] Give me your hand.

1092
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:02,459
Okay.

1093
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,694
[Kaylee] Ronnie what's
wrong? Don't stop.

1094
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,097
Ronnie!
Oh shit.

1095
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:10,700
- Spray. Spray!
- [Kaylee] I'm trying!

1096
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:13,070
(Screaming)

1097
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:14,704
