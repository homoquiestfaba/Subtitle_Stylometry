1
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:25,690
- I don't know
where to start, really.

2
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,028
Hell, you don't even know me.

3
00:00:29,612 --> 00:00:31,779
So I don't expect you to
forgive me for all the things

4
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:32,615
I've done.

5
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,772
- Bobby Hawkins.

6
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,150
- Birdy.

7
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,276
How about it, man?

8
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:17,780
- Look at you, you
look good, man.

9
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,450
- Last I heard you were
working over at the

10
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,659
County Clerk's office

11
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,785
- No, man,

12
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,454
I got on over at the plant.

13
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,872
Going on six years now.

14
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:28,750
- Shit.

15
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,419
- Worked my way
up to Team Leader.

16
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:34,921
- Good for you, man.

17
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:38,843
Come on, you got
what, 9, 10 kids now?

18
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,306
- Three, two girls and a boy.

19
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,682
Best things that
ever happened to me.

20
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,310
- I'm happy for you, brother.

21
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,853
- Been doing good.

22
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,565
Going out to First Baptist.

23
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,276
Alyssa goes out there.

24
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,696
You should come visit some time.

25
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,409
You ever talk to her?

26
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,830
- Alyssa? She don't
want to talk to me.

27
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,833
- You might be surprised.

28
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:15,838
What's your plan then?

29
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,343
- Just... don't go back.

30
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,720
- That's a good plan.

31
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,854
- Let me ask you
something, Birdy.

32
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:38,945
After all that went down, did
you ever hear from Cofield?

33
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:43,866
- You?

34
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,708
I never could figure
it out neither.

35
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,669
We was like brothers.

36
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:59,755
I always figured I'd
hear from him some day.

37
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:01,718
A letter or something.

38
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,348
- He was the only one
of us that got away.

39
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:14,439
Sometimes I feel like he's in
some sort of parallel universe

40
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:18,399
sleeping like a baby
on stacks of cash

41
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,444
while we're stuck in this one.

42
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,489
- Parallel universe, huh?

43
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,034
Man, you was in there too long.

44
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,042
Harry's done good for himself.

45
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,419
Owns a bunch of
restaurants, couple of bars,

46
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,006
even ran for city commission.

47
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:42,342
- Harry, huh.

48
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,429
- Shoot. You, me,
Cofield, Harry.

49
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,476
We was something back
in the day, wasn't we?

50
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,644
The four horsemen.

51
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,774
- Four stooges, more like it.

52
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:04,364
- Ain't that the truth.

53
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,034
It's good to see you, brother.

54
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:10,912
- Hmm.

55
00:07:15,685 --> 00:07:18,604
- Battery is low, recharge now.

56
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,564
- Hey buddy.

57
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,901
- Buddy? What is that, a joke?

58
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:07,778
- Come on, man.

59
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:13,073
- What you think that is? A
toy, something to play with?

60
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,451
- I just wanted some company.

61
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,577
- Company?

62
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,122
- It gets lonely out here, man.

63
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,917
- Would you prefer LaGrange?

64
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,129
Look, don't drag my
black ass out here again.

65
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,171
- I'm sorry.

66
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,589
- I got things to do.

67
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,965
- I know.
- I'm busy.

68
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:30,843
- I know.

69
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:33,888
- You could have called.

70
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,642
- You wouldn't have come.

71
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:43,940
- How's Mrs. Whitaker?

72
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,608
- Hell if I know.

73
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,610
Hell, man, what did you do?

74
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:51,987
- It's what I didn't do.

75
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:52,949
I didn't listen.

76
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,661
I didn't come home
every night at 6:30.

77
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,497
I didn't leave the
toilet seat down.

78
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,792
I didn't brush my teeth.

79
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,047
How's it going looking for work?

80
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,093
- Where am I
supposed to go, huh?

81
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:17,555
Mine's shut down,
factory's full up.

82
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,974
Hell, that's how I got in
this mess in the first place.

83
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,185
- Well, you gotta put
some feelers out there.

84
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,104
You know that was the deal.

85
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,982
- Well, I got plenty to
keep me busy around here.

86
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,110
Look at this place.

87
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:38,244
- Well, I might be able
to help you out with that.

88
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,872
I got a hand, he's
a hard worker.

89
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:52,550
You, you talk to Kelly?

90
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,636
- What would I say?

91
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,309
- She's still working down
there at the Hideaway.

92
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,771
- Hell, that place
ain't burned down yet?

93
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,692
- She still looks the same too.

94
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,904
- I'm done with all that mess.

95
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:17,325
- Yeah, you are.

96
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:19,869
- Whole 'nother life.

97
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,290
- Here's to a new one.

98
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,375
- Let's do it.

99
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,399
- Mr. Hawkins?

100
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,357
- Como estas?

101
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:16,358
- Bien, bien.

102
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,111
- Whitaker send you?

103
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,158
He says you need help.

104
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,776
- All right, fellas.

105
00:12:58,778 --> 00:12:59,987
Your wife picking you up?

106
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,032
- She takes the
truck on Fridays.

107
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,825
- Where to?

108
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,286
- Cleans houses in town.

109
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,208
- So you just got
the one vehicle?

110
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:14,084
- We make it work.

111
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:17,963
- Well, I got an
old beater out back.

112
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:20,549
You get her running,
she's yours.

113
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:24,929
Been sitting there 20 years.

114
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,223
- You're joking.

115
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:32,144
- It ain't like I'm doing you
a favor. It's a piece of shit.

116
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,068
- Gracias.

117
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,881
- What can I get you?

118
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,927
You want a drink?

119
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,678
- I wanna see her.

120
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,639
- For what?

121
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,099
- What do you think?

122
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,975
She's my girl.

123
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,938
- She ain't been
yours for a long time.

124
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,190
- Hell does that mean?

125
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,025
I'm her daddy.

126
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,487
- She's got a daddy,
and it ain't you.

127
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,489
- You seeing somebody?

128
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,282
- That's none of your business.

129
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,203
- Well, Lissy is my business.

130
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:55,913
Where is she?

131
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,205
- Hell, Bobby.

132
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,959
That girl ain't lived
with me in years.

133
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:03,504
- Well, if she ain't living
with you, where is she?

134
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,256
- Harry took her in.

135
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,383
- Harry.

136
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:11,301
- Shit, Bobby, he's my brother.

137
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,178
I was dead broke.

138
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,556
I couldn't afford to raise her.

139
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,349
She's better off.

140
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,061
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

141
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,063
- You gonna come in here
now like a concerned father

142
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,066
and judge me?

143
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,236
Get the fuck outta here Bobby.

144
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,403
- Give me her number.

145
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,447
- I ain't giving you shit.

146
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,449
- This guy bothering you?

147
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,953
- He's just leaving.

148
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,498
- Not till I get that number.

149
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,625
- It's time for you
to move on, hoss.

150
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,337
- Take it easy, big boy.

151
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,558
- Bobby, here, just go.

152
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,196
- Thought you'd beat me back?

153
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,366
- Had some business.

154
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,575
- I hope it was worth it.

155
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,493
- Look, I ain't going nowhere.

156
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:23,123
Hell, I'm right here, I'm
just looking for my daughter.

157
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,584
- Well, I could'a
helped you with that.

158
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,087
- Right, you didn't even tell
me she was living with Harry.

159
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,339
- I didn't want you to go
out and do something stupid.

160
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,425
Getting mixed up with
Harry Casper again

161
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,385
is something you don't need.

162
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,679
You thought he was into
bad shit back in the day,

163
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,765
you should see the
shit he's doing now.

164
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,808
- I ain't getting
mixed up with nobody.

165
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,727
I'm just trying to see Alyssa.

166
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:48,148
- It's been 10 years, why
you care all of a sudden?

167
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,233
- Fuck you, Whitaker.

168
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,071
- See, you packing
up the reasons why I
should take you in.

169
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,697
- You ain't going to take me in.

170
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:56,575
- And why not?

171
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:00,660
- As I recall, you helped me
polish off a bottle of Beam

172
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,329
the other night.

173
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,789
Getting shit-faced
with your parolee...

174
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,502
...ain't gonna look too
good to your supervisor.

175
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:09,296
- You asshole.

176
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,381
- Let me go.

177
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,177
- All right. Just this once.

178
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:20,806
This shit happens again,
blackmail ain't gonna help you.

179
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,518
I can't protect you after this.

180
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,229
- Let me get you a drink.

181
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:27,189
- You asshole.

182
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:05,144
- Look at you.

183
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,479
Ain't changed a lick.

184
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,567
Maybe a little uglier.

185
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,154
Ain't you going to invite me in?

186
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:21,451
- Hoo-wee, it's
been a long time.

187
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,164
So how long you been out and
you ain't come to see me?

188
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,581
- Been busy.

189
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:30,127
- Hmm, that's what I hear.

190
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,587
Kelly says you was
down at the Hideaway,

191
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,756
asking about Lissy.

192
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:39,761
- How's she doing?

193
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,681
- Just let me worry about her.

194
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,400
Pere... Perelandra?

195
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,780
You getting all egghead on me?

196
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,667
Hey, you remember the
time that we stacked

197
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,420
all those beer cans
up on your daddy's TV

198
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,634
and then we took
turns swinging at it?

199
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,387
- Yeah, except you missed.

200
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,266
Busted the shit outta
your daddy's Magnavox.

201
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,978
- He beat the tar outta me.

202
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,901
How can I help you, Harry?

203
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,279
- Oh, I'm glad
you asked me that.

204
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,244
You got something
that belongs to me.

205
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:52,999
- Money's long gone.
Cofield took every penny.

206
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,877
- Oh did he now?

207
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,672
- I was there.

208
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,298
I watched him cross
over into Jellico.

209
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,802
That's the last I seen him.

210
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:06,680
- Well, now I know that's
what you told the press

211
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,306
and the cops.

212
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:12,312
But, see, I never
believed that story.

213
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,816
Because, see, you was the
greediest one of the whole bunch

214
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:20,860
and there ain't no way in
hell you would've let Cofield

215
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,946
light out with all that cash.

216
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,366
- I was scared, man.

217
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,743
I figured that if
he had the money,

218
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,662
the cops would go
after him and not me.

219
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,707
I come home and there's a
shit load of cherry-toppers

220
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,458
in my driveway.

221
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,712
- So he sold you out, huh?

222
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:38,797
- Maybe.

223
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:45,345
- That is about 10 pounds of
horse shit in a 5 pound bag.

224
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,431
I think you know
exactly what happened.

225
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,850
And it had nothing
to do with Cofield

226
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:55,520
riding off into
the sunset, did it?

227
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,606
- That was 13 years ago.

228
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,859
That shit's over and done with.

229
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:04,364
- You're a changed
man. You and Birdy.

230
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,073
Done found Jesus.

231
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:09,953
You done got washed in
the blood of the Lamb.

232
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:12,664
See, the problem is,

233
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,418
the blood doesn't wash
away what you owe.

234
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,420
- I ain't in debt to you.

235
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,755
- Au contraire.

236
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:24,549
See, we made a pact.

237
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,843
We was all gonna split
that money up four ways.

238
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:31,514
Now, in my mind, when a
man makes pact, it stands

239
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:36,311
and it don't matter no
nevermind how many years pass.

240
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,438
- From what I hear, you
own half the county.

241
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,983
What do you need more money for?

242
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:43,945
Look, I wish I could
help you, Harry.

243
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,541
- I'm gonna get my money.

244
00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,796
Maybe not today.
Maybe not tomorrow.

245
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,509
But I'm gonna get what's mine.

246
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,810
Whoa, you should have
seen your face right then.

247
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,855
- I'd like to see Alyssa.

248
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:22,651
- Oh, I bet you would.

249
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,114
- Look, I appreciate you
helping her out and everything.

250
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:31,827
- Helping her out?

251
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:39,668
You make it, I don't know,
sound like I just, I don't know,

252
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,505
bought her some school
books or shit like that.

253
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,552
I raised that girl.

254
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:54,516
- And I appreciate all
you done. All the same...

255
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:58,562
- You have a good
day, Bobby boy.

256
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:12,617
- How's it coming?

257
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:17,205
- Levantando a los muertos.

258
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,209
My daughter, she
ain't picking up.

259
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,878
- She probably don't
know it's you calling.

260
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,048
Don't have you saved
on her contacts.

261
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,679
How old is she?

262
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,180
- Seventeen.

263
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:39,811
- That's it then. Ninas don't
talk anymore, they text.

264
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:44,065
- Text?
- Si, text.

265
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,926
- Sweet pea? ...the hell?

266
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,764
I gotta teach you everything?

267
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:18,767
- I reckon.

268
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,270
- Sweet pea... You know
what my wife would've done

269
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:25,772
if she seen that shit?

270
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,482
- I thought she left you.

271
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:29,234
- She came back.

272
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,569
- Well, that's good, right?

273
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,863
- And she checks my phone
at least 12 times a day.

274
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,660
So don't be sending me
no more texts, okay.

275
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,787
- So what do I do?

276
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,623
- You gotta pull up the
names on your contact list.

277
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:46,503
Since you're an asshole,
you ain't got no contacts.

278
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:50,672
But I'm going to add a
Alyssa under one condition.

279
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:52,632
You got to promise me
that you'll just keep this

280
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,218
between you and
Alyssa, understand?

281
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,803
No Harry --

282
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,971
- What do I want with Harry?

283
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,222
- Nothing.

284
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,557
No how you doing?

285
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,061
No long time no see, nothing.

286
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,853
You have to promise that
you're gonna keep this

287
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,522
between you and your daughter.

288
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,191
- Of course.

289
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,572
- All right, she's in there now.

290
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,906
So when you ready
to send a message,

291
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:19,869
all you gotta do is type the
message and then click send.

292
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,746
- Phones can do all
kinds of things, huh?

293
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:28,753
- Oh shit, you can watch TV,
watch movies, play video games.

294
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,005
You can check the
weather in Beijing.

295
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,631
- Why would I want to do that?

296
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,258
- Well, I'm just
saying you can do it.

297
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,885
You can take pictures,
record voices, just like --

298
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:40,056
- No shit, I ain't stupid.

299
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,851
No shit, I ain't stupid.

300
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,269
I really sound like that?

301
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,563
- It's worse in person.

302
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,691
- I am stupid.

303
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:55,280
- All right, it's ready to send.

304
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,160
- I think it worked.

305
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,662
- You did it.
- I did it.

306
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,667
That's the hardest
thing I ever did.

307
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,212
- There's hope for you yet.

308
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:19,505
- I'll try to give you details,

309
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:21,799
but you know, I was
kind of out of it.

310
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,469
- Hmm.

311
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:28,514
- It was a blur, but he
got to wailing on me.

312
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,810
So I grabbed my blade
and I stuck him.

313
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,811
- Did he leave
anything else behind?

314
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,521
- Nothing I seen.

315
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,234
- Well, what do you think he
was after? Drugs? Electronics?

316
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:40,779
- Have you seen my TV?

317
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,113
And no, I ain't got no drugs.

318
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,865
- All right, well he
was after something.

319
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,201
Think you might have known him?

320
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,535
Maybe one of those men
you got working for you.

321
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,915
- No, it wasn't them.

322
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,250
I didn't see their face,
but I know who sent them.

323
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,835
Harry Casper.

324
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,504
- Well, what makes you say that?

325
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:01,422
- Cause he paid me
a visit yesterday.

326
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,216
Made some threats.

327
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,467
- Such as?

328
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:07,428
- Just that he wanted money

329
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:09,889
and he was gonna get
it one way or another.

330
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:14,020
- Money... The
First Federal money?

331
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:20,107
- He thinks I still got
it, but that was ages ago.

332
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,443
Ricky Cofield took
it back in the day.

333
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:25,071
- Then why would Harry Casper
come out here looking for it?

334
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:26,199
- I don't know.

335
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,829
- You get a good
look at the truck?

336
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:34,121
- Dodge Ram, I think.

337
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,873
- Ram... License plate?

338
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,253
- Truck was blue, I saw that.

339
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:44,090
Hey, are you kin to Dick Gray?

340
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:44,926
- My uncle.

341
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,052
- I thought you favored him.

342
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,137
Old Dick hauled me off to county

343
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:51,430
more times than I care to admit.

344
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,140
How's he doing?

345
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,934
- He passed.

346
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,394
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

347
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,437
I'm gonna do the best I
can with the information

348
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:02,108
you've given me and the
evidence that we collected.

349
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,818
- So, that's it?

350
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,278
What am I supposed to do?

351
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,990
Just hang out like
a lump on a log?

352
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,908
Wait for them to come back?

353
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,034
- Maybe they won't.

354
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,872
- Oh they will, sure as shit.

355
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,831
Harry don't quit when
he wants something.

356
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,291
- That's assuming that
Harry is behind --

357
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,377
- I have no doubt.

358
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,297
- Then I suggest
you get yourself

359
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,092
a good home security system.

360
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:28,469
- That's it?

361
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:32,096
- Unless you wanna give me
the whole story, Mr. Hawkins,

362
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,556
there ain't a lot
more that I can do.

363
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,641
- The whole story, I
told you everything.

364
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,020
- Okay, well I can't
figure why you'd insist

365
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,189
that Harry Casper is
hellbent on harassing you

366
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,610
if there ain't more to it all.

367
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,571
- I am the victim here.

368
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,367
- I'll write it up.

369
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:53,451
- You do that.

370
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,161
- Have a good one.

371
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:55,997
- Shit.

372
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,012
- Well?

373
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,224
- Well, he thinks
Casper's involved.

374
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,017
- What do you think?

375
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,479
- I don't know yet.

376
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:27,111
- What's to know?

377
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:01,020
- Folks say to me, "Pastor,

378
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:07,235
what I do in private
is my own business.

379
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:10,697
Long as I don't hurt nobody."

380
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:16,577
But now the scripture says
there is nothing hidden

381
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:19,288
that will not be revealed.

382
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:25,420
And there is no
secret that's kept,

383
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:28,089
that will not come to light.

384
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:45,271
- Alyssa...

385
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,981
- I know you?

386
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:49,193
- I'm Bobby... your dad.

387
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,613
- Look what we got here.

388
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:54,991
- Harry.

389
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,119
- Get in the car.

390
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,121
Go.

391
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,751
Something I can do for you?

392
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,297
- Next time you want
to send a message,

393
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,006
you might wanna
bring it yourself

394
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,342
instead of sending your boys.

395
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,637
- That's the Bobby I remember.

396
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,685
- Take care of yourself now.

397
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,149
- Bobby! You made it.

398
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,318
You coming to church now?

399
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,237
- Probably not.

400
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,658
- Everything all right?

401
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,495
- Birdy, come on.

402
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,052
- Turn that shit back on.

403
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,222
- I got a headache.

404
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,142
- Something you wanna say to me?

405
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,393
- Was that really my dad?

406
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,479
- You got nothing to
do with Bobby Hawkins.

407
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:09,524
You understand me?

408
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,692
- Ow!

409
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,778
- Do you understand?

410
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,656
- Okay.

411
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,845
- Well, well, well,
look-ee who we got here.

412
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,679
Can I get you anything?

413
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,099
We got any sippy cups?

414
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:47,768
- Heard you paid your old
buddy Bobby Hawkins a visit.

415
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:49,687
- Not against the law, is it?

416
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,106
- No. He said you
made him some threats.

417
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,650
Funny thing is he was
assaulted outside his home

418
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,570
later that night.

419
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,112
Any connection there?

420
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,780
- You tell us,
you're the police.

421
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:00,825
- What happened here?

422
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,410
- Fell outta my tree stand.

423
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:05,786
- What were you doing
in your tree stand?

424
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,787
- I was trying to
bag an eight pointer.

425
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,788
What do you think?

426
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,582
- It ain't deer season.

427
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,583
- Well... I was...

428
00:36:10,585 --> 00:36:11,669
- Trevor, shut up.

429
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,462
- Hawkins said he saw a
vehicle leaving the scene,

430
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,590
a blue pickup, kind of
like that one out front.

431
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,592
Does that seem odd to you?

432
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:22,430
- A blue pickup in
Franklin County?

433
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,724
No, it doesn't.

434
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,601
- Girl, you gonna do
anything or just harass us?

435
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:30,644
- Funny you should ask...

436
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,731
One of the intruders left
some blood on Hawkins' lawn.

437
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,566
Lab has it now.

438
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:36,942
Same lab that has your
sample from the rape charge

439
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,569
back in '16.

440
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,820
So I find a match
between that sample

441
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:41,447
and the one from Hawkins' lawn.

442
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,492
Then, yeah, I'm
gonna do something.

443
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,829
I don't know what grievance
you still have with

444
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,247
Bobby Hawkins,

445
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,665
but you keep poking him

446
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,334
and you're bound to
stir up a shit storm.

447
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,295
It's not gonna be
good for anybody.

448
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:58,297
Hawkins is just trying
to start over up there.

449
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,717
You leave him alone.

450
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:02,676
- Let me get this straight,

451
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,972
are you suggesting we throw
him a housewarming party?

452
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,850
- I told you, Harry.

453
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:11,479
Don't make me tell you again.

454
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,703
- Baby.
- Momma.

455
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,499
- You want something to eat?
- I'm good.

456
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,876
- Help me out here.

457
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,671
- This a new one?

458
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,673
- I've done this one before.

459
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,927
For some reason, it just
never gets any easier.

460
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,346
- Ask you a question?

461
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,515
- Yeah, fire away.

462
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,353
- My dad... what's he like?

463
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,730
- What's he like?

464
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,856
Well, he was up at
LaGrange for about 10 years

465
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:59,858
and never lifted a
finger to contact you.

466
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,945
What's that tell you?

467
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:05,823
- I remember, though,
when I was just little,

468
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,951
he used to play the harmonica
to help me fall asleep.

469
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:09,870
Remember that?

470
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:12,331
- Yeah.

471
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:15,708
Well.

472
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,420
- I think I wanna talk to him.

473
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,297
- Suit yourself.

474
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,840
You're gonna be disappointed.

475
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,258
- Right.

476
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:27,636
Well... I'll leave you to it.

477
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,721
- Well, hey, you just got here.

478
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,972
Stay and help me.

479
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,390
- I got some things to do.

480
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,517
- What do you got to do?

481
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:37,062
Hey... You got anything?

482
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,897
- I ain't got nothing.

483
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:42,401
- Bullshit. I know
Harry hooks you up.

484
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:45,362
Come on, baby... just
a little something?

485
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,365
- Sorry, momma.

486
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,792
- Hell, my dad's been
locked up a bunch of times.

487
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,753
- At least you know him.

488
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:01,630
- I guess.

489
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,429
- Is he cool?

490
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:11,807
- I don't know.

491
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:14,894
He's all right.

492
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,025
At least your dad's trying.

493
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,029
I mean, he called you.

494
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:32,912
- So, what, you'd call him back?

495
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,782
- All right.

496
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,414
One for you, one for me.

497
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:19,041
All right.

498
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:41,772
So...

499
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:46,694
You look so big.

500
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,448
- I ain't a baby no more.

501
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,413
- Thanks for coming.

502
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,794
- So you really
can't go nowhere?

503
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:10,050
- Ah... grocery and church.

504
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:11,927
- That's about all.

505
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,555
Rat in a cage.

506
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,729
- Sweet pea... Why'd
you call me that?

507
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:24,565
- Your momma never told you?

508
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,150
- She never talked
much about you.

509
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:32,613
- Well, when you were
born, we wrapped you up

510
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:36,909
and you looked just like
a little pea in a pod.

511
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:37,786
So...

512
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,503
How's Harry treating you?

513
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:49,548
- All right.

514
00:41:55,554 --> 00:42:00,100
To tell you the truth, I ain't
really sure why I'm here.

515
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,187
- Hey, you like books?
- Sure.

516
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:09,818
- I read a lot in LaGrange,
as you might imagine.

517
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,947
You like science fiction?

518
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:17,282
That Harry Potter shit?

519
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,117
- I like fantasy.

520
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,955
- Oh, shit, I got that.

521
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:26,710
There's this space
trilogy. You'd love it.

522
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:32,297
There's this kid who goes to
Mars and finds out that Earth

523
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,677
has been cast out
of the solar system.

524
00:42:36,512 --> 00:42:40,641
This guy, Ransom, he fights an
evil force to restore Earth.

525
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:49,525
Let me see... listen to this.

526
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,528
"The smells in the
forest were beyond all

527
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,907
that he had ever conceived.

528
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,992
To say that they
made him feel hungry

529
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:01,996
and thirsty would be misleading.

530
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,166
They created a new kind
of hunger and thirst,

531
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,252
a longing that seemed to
flow over from the body

532
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,672
into the soul..."

533
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:13,841
What's the matter?

534
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:16,176
- I gotta go.

535
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,348
- I'd like to see you
again. I mean, if you want.

536
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,228
Well, at least take
the book, it's good.

537
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:00,846
- Hell is this?

538
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,056
- A book.

539
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,267
- Oh, no shit.

540
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:07,394
Where'd you get it?

541
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,066
Went and seen him, didn't you?

542
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:15,944
Now what did I tell
you about that?

543
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:20,614
- I just --
- Oh I just, I just what?

544
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,366
Let me ask you something.

545
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,284
Who do you think it was that
kept a roof over your head,

546
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:25,913
ever since you was yay high?

547
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,248
See, I know what
is best for you.

548
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:32,751
And he's got nothing
to say in the matter.

549
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,879
Now what part of that
does your little pea brain

550
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:37,714
not understand?

551
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,633
- I just wanted to meet him.

552
00:44:39,635 --> 00:44:40,302
- What for?

553
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:43,929
- I got a right.

554
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,639
- You what?

555
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,225
- I got a right to
see him if I want.

556
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,851
- Oh, you got a right...

557
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,729
You got a right to do
exactly what I say.

558
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,066
- Screw you, Harry.

559
00:44:57,152 --> 00:45:02,072
- Now listen, everything
you got, everything you are

560
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:06,912
is because of me, and
don't ever forget it.

561
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,727
- How you doing, Mr. Hawkins?

562
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,811
- I'm doing.

563
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,398
- Your daughter around?

564
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,357
- Why?

565
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,778
- Apparently, she
ran off last night.

566
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,198
- Well, she hadn't
come around here.

567
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,866
You check with her mother?

568
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,951
- Yeah, she ain't
been by there neither.

569
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,121
But I wouldn't worry.

570
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,747
- You wouldn't, huh?

571
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,290
- No, you know how kids are.

572
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,833
She probably got pissed at Harry

573
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,879
and ran off to a
friend's for a few days.

574
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,382
But she comes by, you
let me know, okay?

575
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,474
- Shit.

576
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:15,353
- Give it a couple
days, she'll show up.

577
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,023
- Hell, it's my fault,
I let Harry raise her.

578
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,983
I got no right to be concerned.

579
00:46:19,985 --> 00:46:21,945
- Sure you do, she's your kid.

580
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:25,866
I need your help, Birdy.

581
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:28,867
You're right.

582
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:31,745
Alyssa is my blood, I don't
care if I'm stuck out here.

583
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,997
I ain't gonna let him hurt her.

584
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,916
- What do you need me to do?

585
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,001
- I need you to go to Harry

586
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,753
and tell him he don't
run things no more.

587
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,963
- Bobby, I don't want to
get caught up in no war.

588
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:43,842
- Just give him the message.

589
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,261
You owe me that.

590
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:57,541
- Have a seat, Birdy.

591
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:08,302
So, you come here
to save my soul?

592
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,929
- Ain't nothing like that.

593
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:14,600
- That's good cause you'd
be wasting your time.

594
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:18,353
But now you gotta tell me
why you're here wasting mine.

595
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,273
- Bobby Hawkins sent me.

596
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:24,610
- You're Bobby's pigeon now.

597
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,487
- He'd have come
himself if he could.

598
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:34,411
- You got balls, Birdy,
I'll tell you that, you do.

599
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:39,080
But, you know, coming
here on Bobby's behalf,

600
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:44,046
I can't tell whether that's
really brave or really stupid.

601
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,967
- Bobby's just worried about
his little girl is all.

602
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:52,262
- Sounds like an accusation.

603
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,389
- Nothing like that.

604
00:48:57,184 --> 00:49:00,020
- Well then, tell me
what it is like, Birdy.

605
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:05,567
- Bobby just don't think
she's safe here is all.

606
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,362
- Well, that's none
of Bobby's business.

607
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,280
Sure as hell ain't
none of yours.

608
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,908
- Shoot, Harry.

609
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,205
Back in the day, he took
the fall for all of us.

610
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,164
If it hadn't been for Bobby,

611
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,293
you and me both would've done
a lot more time than we did.

612
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,088
We all robbed that place.

613
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:30,006
But you and me did
three piddly years.

614
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:32,008
Knowing that he was in
there that whole time,

615
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,678
I don't know about you,
but that killed me.

616
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,557
- So, what, you think
we owe him something?

617
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,227
Let me ask you something, Birdy.

618
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:44,231
You say Bobby's so concerned
about his little girl.

619
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:52,364
Just exactly what does
he intend to do about it?

620
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,952
- He just says to tell you

621
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,623
that he ain't afraid to
tussle if it comes to that.

622
00:50:13,301 --> 00:50:15,301
Listen, I ain't trying
to stir nothing up.

623
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,513
It's what he said.

624
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:22,684
- Come in my house uninvited.
Call me an unfit guardian.

625
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,146
Pass along a threat.

626
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:27,272
And you ain't trying
to stir nothing up?

627
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,649
- You ain't my enemy, Harry.

628
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:31,484
- Birdy, Birdy...

629
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:33,611
I really thought you were
smarter than this, I really did.

630
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,780
I mean, you went and
got yourself on the
straight and narrow

631
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:39,534
but you haven't got the sense

632
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:43,371
God gave a three-legged
coon dog who's lost his nose

633
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,792
and ought to be put down.

634
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:48,587
- Please don't
shoot the messenger.

635
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,717
- Don't worry, Birdy...
I ain't gonna shoot you.

636
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,546
- To think we used
to be friends.

637
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:38,845
- Stooges.

638
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,681
- What?
- Stooges.

639
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:50,315
- Boys, show him what we
do to uninvited guests.

640
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,916
- Morning. What are
you girls doing?

641
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:52,878
- Just walking.

642
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,587
- Why don't you get in the car?

643
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,921
- We ain't done nothing.

644
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,798
- Oh, you're not in trouble.

645
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,886
I promise. There's some
people worried about you.

646
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:02,888
Come on.

647
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,588
Mr. Hawkins.

648
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:38,924
- What's going on?

649
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:43,259
- We, uh... we pulled
Lawrence Birdwhistle's car

650
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,305
out of Benson
Creek this morning.

651
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:47,807
- Where is he?

652
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,603
- He was inside, he
was beat to death.

653
00:53:56,858 --> 00:53:59,525
His wife said y'all
spoke the other day.

654
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:00,612
What'd you talk about?

655
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,821
- You think I had
something to do with it?

656
00:54:03,823 --> 00:54:05,573
- No one is saying that.

657
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,200
- Birdy was my friend.

658
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,493
If you want to know
what happened to him,

659
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:09,786
why don't you ask Harry Casper?

660
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,663
- I intend to.

661
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:14,958
- And why aren't y'all out
there looking for my daughter?

662
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,585
- Alyssa's home, I picked
her up this morning.

663
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,504
She's over at Harry's now.

664
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,883
- Hell, then she's in more
trouble than she ever was.

665
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,426
- Harry Casper is
her legal guardian,

666
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:27,387
there is nothing we
can do about that.

667
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:30,767
- There's nothing you can
do about anything, is there?

668
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:35,770
What good are them badges

669
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,563
if y'all are all
working for Harry?

670
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:39,023
- Well, what good is this badge

671
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,358
if you won't tell
me what you know

672
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:41,486
that'll help me bring him in?

673
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,741
- I told you... I
ain't hiding nothing.

674
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:24,446
- Sorry to hear
about your friend.

675
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,284
- Who knows what
he's gonna do next?

676
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:32,287
I gotta get Alyssa out of there.

677
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,829
- And how you gonna do that?

678
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,748
The second you leave,
every black and white

679
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,583
in the county is
gonna be on your ass.

680
00:55:38,585 --> 00:55:40,460
What good you gonna
do her back in prison?

681
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,755
- I gotta do something.

682
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,672
- Bobby, let the cops
take care of this.

683
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,299
- The cops.

684
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:47,633
- They're your best
friends right now.

685
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,052
- Some friends.
- Let them do their job.

686
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:52,930
- They did their job,
and Birdy's dead.

687
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,600
I ain't gonna sit around
and wait for the same thing

688
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:56,978
to happen to Alyssa.

689
00:55:58,563 --> 00:55:59,773
- You ain't got
a lot of options.

690
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,069
- I thought you were on my side.

691
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,322
- I ain't on nobody's side.

692
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,910
My job is to keep you
out of prison, that's it.

693
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:15,622
These days, you ain't
making that very easy.

694
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:44,649
- Alyssa?

695
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:46,778
It's your... Bobby Hawkins.

696
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,907
Listen, can you come out here?

697
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:53,410
I'd like to talk to you.

698
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,496
Yeah.

699
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,538
- What do you want?

700
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,708
- Listen, I know Harry's
got a hold on you.

701
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,041
Believe it or not,

702
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:45,960
he had the same hold
on me back in the day.

703
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,670
- Nobody's got no hold on me.

704
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,088
- Then get out of there.

705
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:50,715
- And go where?

706
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:53,718
- Here. Come stay with
me. You'll be safe.

707
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,054
- I don't even know you.

708
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,434
- For the longest time,

709
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:03,102
I sat up there in
that rock thinking

710
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:08,109
I wasn't worthy or something
to be your daddy, you know?

711
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:11,863
Like you were better
off without me.

712
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:16,159
Figured you felt the same,
so I stopped writing.

713
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:19,996
- You never wrote me.

714
00:58:22,081 --> 00:58:24,083
- I wrote you two
years straight.

715
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:26,920
- I never got no letters.

716
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,675
- You may want to ask
your mom about that.

717
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:37,011
All I'm asking is that
you give me a chance.

718
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,515
- You had your chance.

719
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,767
Harry's right, he's the only
one ever gave a shit about me.

720
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,936
- Harry only cares about Harry.

721
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:47,104
- Cares more than you ever did.

722
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:49,815
Ever since you come around,
everything's gone to shit.

723
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,484
And I don't want no part of it.

724
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:52,985
- What do you want?

725
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:55,196
- I just want things
to go back to normal.

726
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:58,157
- Back to him
smacking you around?

727
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,117
- You don't get it, do you?

728
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,745
I'm glad you got that
thing on your ankle.

729
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:04,914
I don't ever wanna
see you again.

730
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,874
I don't want you to call me.

731
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:09,837
You was never my dad and
you're never gonna be.

732
01:00:53,608 --> 01:00:55,902
- What's on your mind, sugar?

733
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:00,696
- I know you're
working for Harry.

734
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:02,408
They got you keeping
an eye on me.

735
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:06,245
It's all right.

736
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:11,332
You're just doing
what you gotta do.

737
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,042
- Bobby...

738
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:14,671
- You know what's fucked up?

739
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,383
I had a plan.

740
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:26,222
Soon as I got out, I was
gonna get what was mine

741
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:28,976
and get the hell outta
here and never look back.

742
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:38,069
Then I saw Alyssa and
all this shit went down.

743
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:49,706
I thought I never wanted to
see her again, but I was wrong.

744
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:51,124
I just didn't know it.

745
01:01:58,464 --> 01:01:59,841
You got kids?

746
01:02:03,010 --> 01:02:06,303
- Two. Boy and a girl.

747
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,223
- So you know.

748
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,477
- Everything I do is for them.

749
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:16,856
- They ever have bad dreams?

750
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,985
- About every other night.

751
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,156
- I have this dream sometimes.

752
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,078
I'm underground, buried

753
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,002
but I'm still alive.

754
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:44,759
And these snakes
break through the dirt

755
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,222
and they wrap around me.

756
01:02:54,228 --> 01:02:59,190
The crazy thing is, I
don't try to fight it.

757
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:00,193
- What do you mean?

758
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:04,322
- I deserve it.

759
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,952
I belong there with the snakes.

760
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,749
- You done your time.

761
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,044
What are you still paying for?

762
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:26,928
- What are you still doing here?

763
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,055
- Oh, what you,
you want me to go?

764
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,392
- I mean here in Devil's Hollow.

765
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:40,356
If you could get outta
here, go anywhere,

766
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:41,275
what would you do?

767
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,070
- Pack up my kids.

768
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,406
Go down to Clearwater.

769
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:56,207
- Do it.

770
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,500
- I can't.

771
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:01,921
- Take your kids,
and get outta here.

772
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:18,062
- You just going to
up and skedaddle, huh?

773
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:21,188
- I'm tired of all this.

774
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:26,112
- Well, at least have one
last drink with your boy.

775
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:28,906
- I really gotta go.
- Sit.

776
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:37,162
What in that pretty
little head of yours

777
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,498
makes you think it's
going to be that easy?

778
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,376
You owe me.

779
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,921
- I done paid you
everything I owe.

780
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,882
We're square.

781
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,302
- We're square when I say so.

782
01:04:51,304 --> 01:04:52,638
- I'm serious, Trevor.

783
01:04:53,639 --> 01:04:56,976
- Oh, I know you are.

784
01:04:58,311 --> 01:04:59,145
- Don't!

785
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,277
- Now, where'd you get this?

786
01:05:20,917 --> 01:05:23,002
- Hawkins gave it to her.

787
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,346
- Oh hell yeah.

788
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:28,109
- Hello? Alyssa?

789
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,319
Hello? Shit.

790
01:06:31,612 --> 01:06:32,569
- Help!

791
01:06:32,571 --> 01:06:33,696
- Alyssa!

792
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,114
- Hey, Bobby boy.

793
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:37,574
I know you got my money.

794
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:40,413
You wanna see Lissy again,
you're gonna bring me that cash.

795
01:06:42,581 --> 01:06:44,206
- Alyssa!

796
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:45,624
- I'll kill this
little bitch, Bobby.

797
01:06:45,626 --> 01:06:47,626
You know I will, just
like I done Birdy.

798
01:06:47,628 --> 01:06:50,671
- You touch her, I will rip
your fucking throat out!

799
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:53,132
- Oh, I'd like to see that.

800
01:06:53,134 --> 01:06:56,260
Thirty minutes. Old Crow Quarry.

801
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,095
Show up a second late,

802
01:06:58,097 --> 01:06:59,638
well, you know what happens
when you disappoint.

803
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:02,143
- Alyssa! Shit!

804
01:07:10,234 --> 01:07:12,109
- Bobby.
- Hey, buddy.

805
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,069
- Sheriff's got the whole
damn county looking for you.

806
01:07:14,071 --> 01:07:15,279
You're not getting away.

807
01:07:15,281 --> 01:07:17,197
- I ain't trying to.

808
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,451
- Well, then stop. Whatever's
going on, we'll figure it out.

809
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,286
- Harry's got Alyssa.

810
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,371
He's gonna kill her
if I don't get there.

811
01:07:24,373 --> 01:07:27,166
- Where? I'll come to you.

812
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,335
Where you going, Bobby?

813
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:02,787
- Here it is.

814
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:14,840
- Hell yeah, it is.

815
01:08:16,342 --> 01:08:18,509
Been waiting a
long time for that.

816
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,553
- Hand her over.

817
01:08:21,180 --> 01:08:23,641
- Hey, girl, come
on out of the car.

818
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:36,819
You always were a
dumb son of a bitch.

819
01:08:36,821 --> 01:08:39,740
She duped you. She lied to you.

820
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,077
It's the only way I could
get you to come out here.

821
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:50,709
Oh, Bobby, I knew
you had this money.

822
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,839
Cofield, he never ran
off to Jellico, did he?

823
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,590
- We were fighting
over the cash.

824
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:01,218
Before I knew it, he drew on me

825
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,596
so I shot him first.

826
01:09:04,265 --> 01:09:05,141
- Ha! Damn, son.

827
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:08,892
- And you killed Birdy.

828
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:13,397
- Well, I ain't gonna lie
about it, it was unfortunate.

829
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:16,441
But had to be done
though, I guess.

830
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:18,110
- He was a good man.

831
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:20,237
He didn't deserve to
be beat like a dog.

832
01:09:20,239 --> 01:09:23,534
- Bobby, in this world nobody
gets what they really deserve.

833
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:27,454
- So, it's just the two of us --

834
01:09:32,710 --> 01:09:35,671
- Bobby, you really are
a dumb son of a bitch.

835
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,175
Say hello to Birdy
and Cofield for me.

836
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:41,844
- Stop!

837
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:46,138
- Oh, now you're gonna shoot me?

838
01:09:46,140 --> 01:09:47,683
- Drop it.
- Or what?

839
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:51,520
You're not gonna shoot anybody.

840
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:56,901
Adios, Bobby.

841
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:03,449
- Put it down.

842
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:15,419
- Bobby, you hold on, you
hold on now, you hold on.

843
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,798
- Probation 45, shots fired!

844
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:23,634
I have two suspects down.

845
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:26,388
I need backup and
medical services now.

846
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:28,557
- You was right.

847
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,647
These things can
do it all nowadays.

848
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:02,422
We were fighting over the cash.

849
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:04,925
Before I knew it, he drew on me

850
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:07,511
so I shot him first.

851
01:11:07,513 --> 01:11:08,472
- Ha! Damn, son.

852
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,768
- And you killed Birdy.

853
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,231
- I ain't gonna lie about
it, it was unfortunate.

854
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:19,856
But had to be done
though, I guess.

855
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:21,525
- He was a good man.

856
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:23,735
He didn't deserve to
be beat like a dog.

857
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:28,284
- Bobby, in this world nobody
gets what they really deserve.

858
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,671
- I don't know
where to start really.

859
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:26,967
Hell, you don't even know me.

860
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:29,843
So I don't expect
you to forgive me

861
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,722
for all the things I've done.

862
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,894
Just know that everything
I do from here on out,

863
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:38,771
it's for you.
