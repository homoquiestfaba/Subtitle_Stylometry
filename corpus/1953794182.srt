00:00:59,777 --> 00:01:00,677
Hi.

2
00:01:02,102 --> 00:01:03,002
I'm Karen,

3
00:01:03,461 --> 00:01:05,086
this is my husband Albert.

4
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:07,446
Hello Albert.
- Nice to meet you.

5
00:01:07,447 --> 00:01:10,202
Karen. - Hi. We just
moved in across the street.

6
00:01:10,203 --> 00:01:11,478
Welcome to
the neighborhood.

7
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:13,509
And this
is our son Edward.

8
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:14,696
Hello Edward.
- Nice to meet you.

9
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:15,932
Same here.

10
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,155
What's your name?

11
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:33,092
99, the Lakers had no trouble with

12
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,043
the Rockets winning 124 to 88.

13
00:01:35,693 --> 00:01:38,748
The Nuggets just got by
the Knicks 114 to 112.

14
00:01:39,087 --> 00:01:42,142
The Supersonics devastated
the Jazz 136 to 78.

15
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:46,248
It was the Trail Blazers over
the Bucks 98 to 94.

16
00:01:46,251 --> 00:01:49,779
The Celtics edged the Bulls
110 to 108 and the Pacers...

17
00:03:12,032 --> 00:03:14,372
Leave me alone.
Assholes!

18
00:03:14,704 --> 00:03:16,985
What are you going to do
run home to daddy?

19
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:18,557
At least
my dad is not a drunk.

20
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:23,054
Shut up!

21
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,679
You are a little
pussy aren't you.

22
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,580
Say it!

23
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:27,632
Say
I'm a little pussy!

24
00:03:27,633 --> 00:03:28,593
No, I'm not!

25
00:03:28,594 --> 00:03:29,255
Yeah you are!

26
00:03:29,256 --> 00:03:31,206
No. I'm not.

27
00:03:33,897 --> 00:03:35,067
Oh yeah.

28
00:03:37,756 --> 00:03:38,656
Ready?

29
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,930
This... pull up
to this corner right here.

30
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,296
You need more energy.

31
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:11,325
Now what?

32
00:04:11,962 --> 00:04:13,392
Now... okay.

33
00:04:13,694 --> 00:04:16,424
So, what I have to do
after I fuck him is

34
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,649
kill him.
Just...

35
00:04:17,878 --> 00:04:19,640
take out the gun
and off him.

36
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,616
Why?

37
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:24,578
'cause you get
a lot of money too.

38
00:04:28,704 --> 00:04:31,187
My mom would never
let me play this kind of game.

39
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:32,813
It's...
way too violent.

40
00:04:39,516 --> 00:04:42,181
That's the way
the world works.

41
00:05:11,611 --> 00:05:13,986
Do you feel anything?

42
00:05:13,987 --> 00:05:15,807
I don't think so.

43
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:21,579
Where is your mom?

44
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:26,093
She lives in the city now.

45
00:05:28,237 --> 00:05:29,212
Why?

46
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,439
Because my dad is an asshole.

47
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,040
And she couldn't take it.

48
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:40,508
Do you miss her?

49
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:45,706
No.

50
00:06:02,004 --> 00:06:03,759
That's the place.

51
00:06:09,489 --> 00:06:11,179
What?
Are you scared now?

52
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,525
Come too now.

53
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,801
Are you okay?

54
00:07:38,038 --> 00:07:41,353
What the fuck are you
looking at, faggot!

55
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:47,790
Hey David,

56
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,676
who gave you
that black eye?

57
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:50,738
Your dad?

58
00:12:55,972 --> 00:12:56,872
The End

59
00:12:56,972 --> 00:13:00,872
