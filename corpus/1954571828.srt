00:00:50,433 --> 00:00:51,764

That's easy, right?

5
00:00:57,273 --> 00:00:59,241
Our parents moved
to the ocean...

6
00:00:59,275 --> 00:01:01,573
and built walls
facing the other way.

7
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:03,579
They... send us
to private school.

8
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:05,672
They hire rent-a-cops
with uniforms...

9
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:09,515
and make them drive around
in little Ford Escorts, see?

10
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:11,349
This sends a powerful message.

11
00:01:11,387 --> 00:01:13,082
There's us and there's them...

12
00:01:13,123 --> 00:01:14,886

13
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:18,121

See, basically,
the thing to remember...

is that... well,
none of it really matters.

I should be talkin'
to your bitch instead, right?

83
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,451
Huh? She wasn't talkin'
to Toby then.

84
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:33,012
What's the smell?
Damn, girl, close your legs!

85

Shit, son! I guess maybe...

89
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:48,467

90
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,499
Oh, shit! It's on now!

Fuck you!

108
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,733
Come on, son.
This is a Sunday.

109
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,398
I been livin' up here in my head
for so long, it's, like...

110
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,134
I can talk to my own God.

111
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:01,974
But y'all motherfuckers
can't feel.

112
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:14,721
Hey, Eric. Good party.

113
00:06:14,757 --> 00:06:16,691
Thanks. Well,
the lease is up next month...

114
00:06:16,726 --> 00:06:19,194
and most of the furniture
that we're still gonna use...

115
00:06:19,228 --> 00:06:21,594
is in Chicago with my mom.
No one's gonna notice anything.

116
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,656
So that means you're not coming
back to school with us?

117
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:28,227
Eww!

118
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:33,298
How's it going over here?
Are you all right?

119
00:06:33,342 --> 00:06:35,173
Oh.

120
00:06:35,211 --> 00:06:37,873
I'm just a...
little sick.

121
00:06:37,914 --> 00:06:39,381
No problem. I mean...

122
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:41,246
I feel really good.

123
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:44,113
That's good.

124
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,951
See? At least now
you know your limit. That's...

125
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:48,718
Heh!

126

00:06:51,894 --> 00:06:54,226
- That's so gross.
- Yeah, girl.

129
00:06:54,263 --> 00:06:57,198
Gotta pace yourself.

130
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:58,723
Ha ha.

131
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:01,498

00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,243
Watch yourself, boy.

135
00:07:09,278 --> 00:07:11,576
Watch myself. I'll do that.

136
00:07:11,614 --> 00:07:13,912
Just for you, Allison.

137
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,884
Damn, high as shit!

138
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,160
Ha ha!

139
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:28,652
So, have you, um...

140
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,496
decided what your...
thing is on...

141
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,627
the big docudrama?

142
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:36,866
Yeah, it's on
what it means to be us.

143
00:07:38,274 --> 00:07:40,538
Shit, son, you're not one of us.

144
00:07:40,576 --> 00:07:42,601
You're the video boy.

145
00:07:42,645 --> 00:07:44,545
Ha ha ha ha.

146
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,276
What it means to be you,
what it means to be wiggers.

147
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,840
What does it mean?

148
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,943
Aw, come on.

149
00:07:49,986 --> 00:07:52,921
You don't really want
to know about that.

150
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,616
Yeah, I do, actually.

151
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:56,955
I mean, today,
kids were gettin' hurt.

152
00:07:56,993 --> 00:07:58,984
Why? For what reason, you know?

153
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,893
Please.

154
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,693
Teenagers think
they'll live forever.

155
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,324
Don't you know?

156
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:09,134
Well, yeah, but that doesn't
answer my question.

157
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,333
Yeah, well,
maybe it's a stupid question.

158
00:08:11,374 --> 00:08:12,568
Ahem.

159
00:08:14,477 --> 00:08:17,412

174
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,674
Better go get it, dawg.

176
00:08:48,644 --> 00:08:50,703
¶ How do you feel¶?

177
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:53,078
¶ Comin' up as a nigga
in the cash game¶

178
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,913
¶ Livin' in the fast lane,
now for real¶

179
00:08:57,587 --> 00:08:59,179
That's my bitch.

180
00:08:59,222 --> 00:09:01,782
I'm his bitch. Yo.

181
00:09:01,824 --> 00:09:04,054
Yeah, Ghetto T.

182
00:09:30,953 --> 00:09:33,285
You like that, don't you?

183
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,914
Yeah.

184
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,025
You're so fuckin' hot.

185
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:40,255
Ahh.

186
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,180
Oh... ha ha.

187
00:10:07,223 --> 00:10:08,986
Damn, girl.

188
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,754
Hahh...

189
00:10:13,429 --> 00:10:14,794
Shit!

190
00:10:19,468 --> 00:10:21,402
Oh... ah!

191
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,038
So, uh...

192
00:10:29,078 --> 00:10:30,773
Westsi-i-i-ide.

193
00:10:30,813 --> 00:10:33,111
How are things at home
with Alli?

194
00:10:33,149 --> 00:10:35,276
You know, the home life.

195
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:37,286
I don't know.
They're cool, I guess.

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:41,518
I mean, her mom's pretty open
about the whole recovery thing.

197
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,219
Yeah. You know,
plenty of parents get sober.

198
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,626
I mean, her moms,
she's always working...

199
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:48,789
like some twelve-step
or whatever.

200
00:10:48,831 --> 00:10:50,162
I don't know.

201
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,326
I think she's, like,
into art now or something.

202
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,061
There was a time
that, like...

203
00:10:56,105 --> 00:10:58,164
you know,
Alli would come home...

204
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,040
and she'd find her mom,
like, passed out...

205
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,807
and she'd have to call
an ambulance and shit.

206
00:11:05,648 --> 00:11:08,378
She was... she was fucked up.

207
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:13,616
But... that was a long time ago.

208
00:11:13,656 --> 00:11:15,920
She's fine now.

209
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:17,789
My pops' in A.A.

210
00:11:17,827 --> 00:11:20,261
With the fuckin' Sex Pistols.

211
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:24,027
I mean, that's the kind of shit
that could make a guy question...

212
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:27,035
like... like, what's really good?

213
00:11:29,004 --> 00:11:31,404
Oh, you poor thing.

214
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,930
Aw!

215
00:11:32,975 --> 00:11:34,738
Guys having fun, huh?

216
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,041
Ha ha ha!

217
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,973
Are you all right?

218
00:12:07,009 --> 00:12:10,911
Yeah. Just...

219
00:12:10,946 --> 00:12:13,346
same old, same old.

220
00:12:16,552 --> 00:12:19,146
I'm glad you came over.

221
00:12:21,457 --> 00:12:23,357
Love you.

222
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:24,791
Yeah.

223
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:30,628
Ha ha ha ha ha.
You're too much.

224
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:31,963
Hi!

225
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,299
- Morning, Daddy.
- Morning, girls.

226
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,530
Morning, Mr. Rubin.

227
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,035
Oh, God, thank you so much
for breakfast...

228
00:12:40,075 --> 00:12:42,373
but I really gotta run.

229
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:44,436
Allison, have some juice.

230
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,948
OK. Thank you.

231
00:12:46,982 --> 00:12:49,382
Talk to your parents
about Sun Valley.

232
00:12:49,418 --> 00:12:50,749
If you want us to call...

233
00:12:50,786 --> 00:12:52,686
No, no, no, I'll ask.
Thank you. Thanks.

234
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,211
All right. See you later, Em.

235
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:55,450
Bye.

236
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,459
Bye-bye.

237
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:00,929
I can't believe someone that hot
is your friend.

238
00:13:00,963 --> 00:13:03,864
Josh. That's enough.

239
00:13:16,111 --> 00:13:17,339
Oh.

240
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:32,951
Mom?

241
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,959
Mom, Dad?

242
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,963
Hello?

243
00:14:20,009 --> 00:14:21,943
Your daughter's here.

244
00:14:21,977 --> 00:14:23,911
Oh, great!

245
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,277
Thank you, Becky.

246
00:14:25,314 --> 00:14:26,406
Do you need anything?

247
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,847
No. I think we're all right.

248
00:14:27,883 --> 00:14:29,373
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

249
00:14:29,418 --> 00:14:30,680
Mmm!

250
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,687
- You're early.
- Yeah.

251
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,121
Oh. Cool.

252
00:14:35,157 --> 00:14:37,125
So, are we, uh,
we goin' to lunch?

253
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:39,992
- Yeah. I'm gonna grab my phone.
- Oh, great.

254
00:14:43,566 --> 00:14:45,466
Doesn't it seem arbitrary...

255
00:14:45,501 --> 00:14:49,904
people having to eat together as
an excuse to have conversations?

256
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:53,733
You want to just shoot the shit?

257
00:14:53,776 --> 00:14:56,472
OK.

258
00:14:56,512 --> 00:14:58,412
So... how are you?

259
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,472
Um... l'm good.

260
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:01,881
Yeah, I'm good.

261
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:04,385
Uh... you?

262
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,081
I'm doin' all right.

263
00:15:06,121 --> 00:15:07,486
I'm a little overworked, but...

264
00:15:07,523 --> 00:15:09,514
Yeah, I'm sure. Always.

265
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,154
So, how's Toby?

266
00:15:13,195 --> 00:15:14,890
Dad. Heh.

267
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,694
I mean, Toby... is he still
your boyfriend, or...

268
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,928
Yeah.

269
00:15:19,969 --> 00:15:21,994
I don't know. I mean...

270
00:15:23,138 --> 00:15:24,230
Whatever.

271
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:27,333
I don't believe
in relationships anyway.

272
00:15:27,376 --> 00:15:29,776
Hmm. Why not?

273
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:32,076
Is it because of
your mother and me?

274
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,680
No.

275
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:41,619
What do you think
about Mom and me...

276
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:45,184
as a couple... our marriage?

277
00:15:45,227 --> 00:15:47,320
How does it strike you?

278
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:52,300
I just... thought we could talk
about everything.

279
00:15:52,334 --> 00:15:54,825
Yeah. Um... well, Dad...

280
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,270
if you're asking me
should you stay married...

281
00:15:57,306 --> 00:16:00,173
I say yes. Stay married.
Just make sure...

282
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,269
to make love at least once a week
and continue therapy.

283
00:16:03,312 --> 00:16:06,645
Ha ha ha!

284
00:16:06,682 --> 00:16:08,547
Fair enough.

285
00:16:08,617 --> 00:16:09,948
Yo, Toby? Hey, honey.

286
00:16:09,985 --> 00:16:12,681
Come pick up me, OK? Bye.

287
00:16:26,969 --> 00:16:28,960
P.L.C. In full eect.

288
00:16:30,539 --> 00:16:33,508
Well, I foresee another night
of driving around.

289
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,510
We'll get a fuckin'
paintball gun...

290
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:38,536
and head down to Hollywood
and pick o some fuckin' tourists.

291
00:16:38,614 --> 00:16:41,481
Yeah, where the B-L-V-D, son?
Where the Hollywood?

292
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,417
Where the real Hollywood at?

Eeh!

331
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:21,774
They're lookin' at us.

332
00:18:21,817 --> 00:18:23,114
They can tell
that we're nervous.

333

Heh heh!

334
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:28,452
Shit. Hey, baby, let's get o
the main street, OK?

335
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,957
We could get busted.

336
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:31,152
Yes, sir, oicer.

337
00:18:32,261 --> 00:18:34,491
Do you think
we should be down here?

338
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:39,233
Toby?

339
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,866
Definitely o the main street.

340
00:19:00,989 --> 00:19:03,048
What you want, homey?

341
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:05,491
How 'bout some herb?

342
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,051
How much?

343
00:19:10,532 --> 00:19:12,727
I don't know.
How much for a quarter?

344
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:14,599
130.

345
00:19:14,636 --> 00:19:16,604
I'll give you 90.

00:19:18,473 --> 00:19:19,940
Come on, man. 110.

347
00:19:19,975 --> 00:19:22,102
It's gonna be 110.
That's what it is.

348
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:23,611
All right.

349
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,943
Ahem. Roca?

Hey, what the fuck, man?

352
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,824
You still counting your money
and everything?

353
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,760
- There's 5-0 all around here.
- Here, here, here.

354
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:40,819
You know that?

355
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,123
Yo, yo, you owe me 10 in change.

356
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,100
Toby, chill!

357
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:47,533
Let's go.

358
00:19:47,569 --> 00:19:49,662
Fuck! The fucking shit's light.

359
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,229
Toby.

360
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,740
- Toby. Toby!
- Relax!

361
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,639
I'll fuckin' handle this.

362
00:19:54,676 --> 00:19:55,973
Yo, Toby, get back in the car.

363
00:19:56,011 --> 00:19:58,206
- I can handle this.
- Get in the car...

364
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:08,155
Yo, dawg.

365
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,658
Yeah, this bag's fuckin' light.

366
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,321
You better back the fuck up
and get back in your car...

367
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:17,764
before you get beat down.

368
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,164
Just gimme
my fuckin' money back, all right?

369
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:21,066
You can get
your fuckin' bag back.

370
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:22,331
We're outta here.

371
00:20:22,371 --> 00:20:23,736
All right?
Here's your fuckin' bag and...

372
00:20:23,772 --> 00:20:24,966
Fuck...

373
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:26,099
Toby?

374
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,268
See? See,
now gimme your fuckin' money.

375
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:32,445
No. She didn't
fucking do anything.

376
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,743
Take the fuckin' money, man,
all right?

377
00:20:33,782 --> 00:20:35,807
We'll get the fuck outta here.

378
00:20:35,851 --> 00:20:37,113
It's my bad.

379
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,141
No shit. Get the fuck down!

380
00:20:38,186 --> 00:20:39,346
- Toby!
- Allison!

381
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,587
You don't know
how to fuckin' act right.

382
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:49,824
Ah, fuck. Come on, man!

383
00:20:49,865 --> 00:20:50,854
- Yeah.
- Stop. Don't.

384
00:20:50,899 --> 00:20:53,993
Please. Please?

385
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,734
You fucked this little fuck
right here?

386
00:21:01,777 --> 00:21:05,042
Huh? Does he pee
all over himself like that...

387
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:07,048
when he's with you? Huh?

388
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:08,276
God!

389
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:10,717
Does he shit on himself,
you wipe his ass for him?

390
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:13,778
Huh? The fuck
is wrong with you?!

391
00:21:15,223 --> 00:21:17,851
Don't you ever fuckin'
come around here again.

392
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:19,019
Bitch.

393
00:22:03,105 --> 00:22:05,403
You know what I mean?
We started swinging...

394
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,238
but my dawg Sammy,
he got my back and shit.

395
00:22:08,276 --> 00:22:10,267
It went down fast.

396
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:12,473
We shook that spot, son.
It was some bullshit.

397
00:22:12,514 --> 00:22:14,675
Yeah, that's...
no doubt, no doubt.

398
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:16,684
Yo, but for real...

399
00:22:16,718 --> 00:22:18,845
the P.L.C. Will go back
in full eect.

400
00:22:18,887 --> 00:22:20,912
All right?
Ain't nobody gonna be frontin'.

401
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:22,617
- Yeah.
- Ha ha.

402
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:25,184
Ooh.

403
00:22:25,227 --> 00:22:27,559
I'm gonna go handle
some business.

404
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,893
Be back.

405
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:33,968
- Hey.
- What's up, ma?

406
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:37,938
You OK?

407
00:22:37,973 --> 00:22:41,306
Yeah. You know,
shit was insane and crazy.

408
00:22:41,343 --> 00:22:43,971
Yeah, I know.

409
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:45,206
I'm gonna go back down there...

410
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:46,805
and find that fuckin'
punk ass cholo...

411
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:47,940
and I'm gonna stick him.

412
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:50,781
- You know, it's OK.
- No. It's not OK.

413
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,481
All right, Alli?
I'm fuckin' hard!

414
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:55,956
A'ight? Nobody does that to me.

415
00:22:58,493 --> 00:22:59,960
Come here. Gimme some sugar.

416
00:23:01,196 --> 00:23:05,064
OK, um...
I know you're OK...

417
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,933
but... if you want
to talk about it, it's OK.

418
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,869
It's cool.

419
00:23:12,941 --> 00:23:15,535
I don't know. Uh... look...

420
00:23:15,577 --> 00:23:17,909
it's just... it's, uh...

421
00:23:23,118 --> 00:23:26,144
I don't know.
What do you want me to say, Alli?

422
00:23:29,958 --> 00:23:31,482
L...

423
00:23:31,526 --> 00:23:33,357
Fuckin' cholos got me.

424
00:23:33,395 --> 00:23:35,022
Hey, Toby.

425
00:23:35,063 --> 00:23:36,997
What's up?

426
00:23:37,032 --> 00:23:39,023
But it ain't gonna happen again.

427
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:41,433
A'ight? Believe that.

428
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:42,596
Bye, Toby.

429
00:23:42,637 --> 00:23:43,934
OK.

430
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:46,131
Adios.

431
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,641
Are you OK?

432
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,007
Yeah!

433
00:23:49,044 --> 00:23:51,808
- I know what we need.
- What?

434
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,178
We need a girls' night.

435
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:54,477
- Yes!
- Yes!

436
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:00,277
Oh, my God, look at that guy.

437
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,119
He's, like,
"I'm gonna fuck a teenager."

438
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:03,488
Ha ha ha!

439
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,322
"Maybe your friends, too!"

440
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,988
Would you like another drink?

441
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,293
Oh! Yes, Richard,
I would love one.

442
00:24:10,332 --> 00:24:12,766
Heh. Could you give her
an apple martini?

443
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,291
She's got to be
getting something, right?

444
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,167
She is so good!

445
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,671
She's owning him right now.

446
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:20,072
Say... l've got some blow.

447
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:21,302
Oh?

448
00:24:21,343 --> 00:24:22,469
Watch and learn.

449
00:24:22,511 --> 00:24:23,910
He's got his hand
in his pocket.

450
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:25,378
Oh, quick, get the Viagra!

451
00:24:25,413 --> 00:24:26,880
She's giving him "fuck me" eyes.

452
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,576
"Fuck me" eyes right now.

453
00:24:28,617 --> 00:24:30,312
She's so good.

454
00:24:30,352 --> 00:24:33,219
- I'll be right back.
- Take her easy.

455
00:24:33,255 --> 00:24:34,745
You just have to
watch and learn.

456
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:37,851
She owns him.

457
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,020
Here she comes.

458
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:41,653
Oh, God.

459
00:24:41,696 --> 00:24:43,186
Right here. Come on.

460
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,096
Ah!

461
00:24:45,133 --> 00:24:47,328
Sweetie, sweetie, look...

462
00:24:51,139 --> 00:24:53,369
All right. I'm way too whacked.

463
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:56,840
I think he thought I was a pro.

464
00:24:56,878 --> 00:24:59,847
Do you think he thought that,
like he would have paid me?

465
00:24:59,881 --> 00:25:03,112
Oh, my God,
that'll be $1,500, please.

466
00:25:03,151 --> 00:25:05,881
So, now that we're wired,
what are we gonna do?

467
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:07,286
Oh, Dopa Yume...

468
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:08,880
Ha ha ha! D-Do...

469
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,289
- Dopo Yume?
- Yeah.

470
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:12,384
I love them. They're so dopo.

471
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,258
At the Roxy.

472
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:16,628
Ha ha ha ha!

473
00:25:16,665 --> 00:25:18,656
Let's go downtown.

474
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,691
Oh, yeah. That worked last time.

475
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:23,727
No. OK, you know that was
just Toby trying to be all hard.

476
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,002
There's a monetary zone
of geography...

477
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:28,134
which we're not allowed to pass.

478
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:29,734
No, OK, you know what?

479
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:32,576
Fuck that. There's a whole
dierent world down there.

480
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,844
There's nothing new here,
the same old boring shit.

481
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:37,477
I mean, come on, Em,
you were there last night.

482
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:39,077
That was so fucked up!

483
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,179
Didn't it make
your stomach feel good?

484
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:44,356
- Let's do it.
- OK.

485
00:25:44,392 --> 00:25:45,791
OK?

486
00:25:45,827 --> 00:25:46,816
- OK.
- Let's do it.

487
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,227
- OK.
- OK. Let's go.

488
00:25:50,498 --> 00:25:51,829
Bye!

489
00:26:13,855 --> 00:26:15,823
Say something.

490
00:26:15,857 --> 00:26:17,347
OK, you know what?

491
00:26:17,392 --> 00:26:19,257
I, for one, would just like
to voice an opinion...

492
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:22,092
that this is crazy wack.
I just had to say that.

493
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:25,962
Oh, my God.

494
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,525
The police should know...

495
00:26:27,569 --> 00:26:29,036
- Oh, my God!
- What?!

496
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,061
That guy's getting a blow job.
Ha ha!

497
00:26:31,106 --> 00:26:34,507
It's not fuckin' funny, Allison.
Shut up!

498
00:26:39,414 --> 00:26:41,348
Oh, my God. Stop here.

499
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,374
Aren't they the guys...

500
00:26:43,418 --> 00:26:44,612
- Yeah.
- Hey, Allison.

501
00:26:44,653 --> 00:26:46,052
Allison...

502
00:26:50,058 --> 00:26:51,286
I got your back.

503
00:26:54,062 --> 00:26:56,053
Want something?

504
00:26:56,097 --> 00:26:58,361
Uh... yeah.

505
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,767
No, I don't...
Um... no.

506
00:27:01,803 --> 00:27:03,771
I don't know.

507
00:27:03,805 --> 00:27:05,363
Not really. Heh.

508
00:27:05,407 --> 00:27:07,307
What are you smiling at?

509
00:27:07,342 --> 00:27:11,142
I'm just, um... smiling.

510
00:27:12,747 --> 00:27:15,147
What are your friends
smiling at?

511
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,882
I think they're having
a nervous breakdown.

512
00:27:24,092 --> 00:27:25,081
Oh, hi.

513
00:27:27,929 --> 00:27:30,295
Hey, let's go, homes.

514
00:27:30,332 --> 00:27:32,323
This is good.

515
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,028
Invite 'em to the party, homes.

516
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,366
Nobody's gonna kill us.

517
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,303
Yeah. They're going to kill us.

518
00:27:37,339 --> 00:27:38,533
Some stupid ass white pussy...

519
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,666
and I'm horny
like a motherfucker.

520
00:27:40,709 --> 00:27:41,801
Boo!

521
00:27:41,843 --> 00:27:43,333
- Aah!
- Aah!

522
00:27:46,281 --> 00:27:48,249
Ha ha ha!

523
00:27:49,651 --> 00:27:50,777
Ha ha!

524
00:27:56,024 --> 00:27:58,925
You guys wanna come
to a party or what?

525
00:28:01,196 --> 00:28:03,391
Yeah.

526
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:23,913
Hey! Whoa. Thanks.

527
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,011
This is so fucking intense.

528
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:29,046
No, it's just family.
You're welcome here.

529
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,648
Hector!

530
00:28:30,692 --> 00:28:33,957
Yo, Hector,
we got a situation, man!

531
00:28:33,995 --> 00:28:35,553
I'll see you later, OK?

532
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,530
- You guys.
- What?

533
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,733
I really think that we need
to call somebody right now.

534
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:50,068
- Relax.
- No, I'm serious.

535
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:51,976
OK. Let go of my arm.

536
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:55,244
Hey, you rucas
want some tequila?

537
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,979
Do I get to eat the worm? Ha ha.

538
00:28:58,019 --> 00:28:59,509
Órale.

539
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:01,579
Sí, bueno.

540
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:03,147
¿ Tu hablas español?

541
00:29:03,191 --> 00:29:04,818
Un poquito.

542
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,417
- What's she doing?
- Ohh!

543
00:29:06,461 --> 00:29:09,589
Oh, my God. Look at that.

544
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:10,928
Please don't...
Al! Please don't...

545
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:11,989
- Right now.
- Go!

546
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,762
You guys, we should go!

547
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,428
Sasha!

548
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:21,270
Hey, move, homes.

549
00:29:26,047 --> 00:29:28,311
- Hey.
- Hey.

550
00:29:30,318 --> 00:29:33,116
- Drinkin' that, man?
- Hell yeah, homes.

551
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:36,551
Oh.

552
00:29:40,829 --> 00:29:41,853
Hey.

553
00:29:41,896 --> 00:29:43,864
- Hey.
- What's your name?

554
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:45,559
Thanks. Um, Amanda.

555
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,397
- Amanda.
- Mm-hmm.

556
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,964
Thank you.

557
00:29:50,004 --> 00:29:51,631
You want to smoke rock?

558
00:29:51,673 --> 00:29:53,641
Mm-mm. No.

559
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,004
You and me, man.
It is fucking brilliant.

560
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:03,143
You think I look hot?

561
00:30:03,184 --> 00:30:05,652
Emily, you always look hot.

562
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:07,052
You're just saying that.

563
00:30:07,088 --> 00:30:08,817
Oh, bullshit.

564
00:30:08,857 --> 00:30:10,722
Girl.

565
00:30:14,629 --> 00:30:17,996
Hmm. Would you fuck that guy?

566
00:30:18,032 --> 00:30:20,933
Yeah. But he'd fuck you
in a second if he could.

567
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,961
Heh.

568
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,166
I think I'm gonna
go talk to him.

569
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:29,005
All right. Well, do it, honey.

570
00:30:29,043 --> 00:30:30,840
But no dancin'.

571
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:32,847
Because it leads
to the hard stu.

572
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:35,076
- Get your ass over there.
- OK.

573
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:40,386
Hi.

574
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,184
- What's up?
- Nothing.

575
00:30:42,223 --> 00:30:44,691
- What's your name?
- I'm Emily.

576
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:46,853
- Damn, Emily...
- Nice to meet you.

577
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:49,389
Ha ha!

578
00:30:58,006 --> 00:30:59,268
Salud.

579
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:04,676
Ooh. Ha ha.

580
00:31:06,581 --> 00:31:08,879
Any new business on Virgil,
homes?

581
00:31:08,917 --> 00:31:10,384
Virgil? No.

582
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,148
You know, we still have the...

583
00:31:18,192 --> 00:31:20,319
you know, maybe...

584
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:22,158
we still have a couple of taxes.

585
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:26,932
Hey, Amanda. Come here.

586
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,442
You know, feeling young
and being cool and...

587
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:40,345
Hey, what's up?
You guys like hip-hop?

588
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:52,350
Hey, ese, that's my homegirl.

589
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:54,657
Hey, don't talk like that.

590
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:57,028
- I'll be right back.
- What's the matter, ese?

591
00:31:57,065 --> 00:32:01,729
Hey, Em, sweetie,
OK, I think we'd better see...

592
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:04,499
about getting the girls
and gettin' home, OK?

593
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:05,972
OK.

594
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,668
Sorry.

595
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,136
Hey, I'll be right there.
Hector... thanks.

596
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,547
I'm Allison.

597
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:19,719
Hey, check it out.

598
00:32:19,754 --> 00:32:22,348
I was gonna move this party
to a motel...

599
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:24,654
- the Alvarado.
- Mm-hmm.

600
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:27,092
That's bad, girl.

601
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,096
What's that face
you got right there, huh?

602
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,927
It's not even like that.

603
00:32:30,965 --> 00:32:33,263
It's just a place
where we party, you know?

604
00:32:33,301 --> 00:32:36,702
I got a friend
who gives us a few rooms.

605
00:32:36,738 --> 00:32:39,536
Kick back.
Nobody abducted your ass so far.

606
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:43,672
Thanks for letting us chill.

607
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,408
Yeah. Hey, don't forget, OK?

608
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:51,714
Alvarado Motel,
just south of 12th Street.

609
00:32:56,024 --> 00:32:58,083
I can't believe
we just fucking did that!

610
00:32:58,126 --> 00:33:00,219
Yo, Alli's always on tip.

611
00:33:00,261 --> 00:33:01,626
That was so much more fun...

612
00:33:01,663 --> 00:33:04,393
than giving some rapper
a blow job at Jerry's Deli.

613
00:33:04,432 --> 00:33:06,366
It was hot!

614
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,699
Ha ha ha ha!

615
00:33:13,374 --> 00:33:14,773
Do you want anything?

616
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,504
No. Thank you, though.

617
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,841
Yeah.

618
00:33:20,815 --> 00:33:25,309
We don't talk so much as
leave clues for one another.

619
00:33:25,353 --> 00:33:27,947
I'm not a latchkey kid.
I have latchkey parents.

620
00:33:41,736 --> 00:33:44,534
So, uh,
are your latchkey parents...

621
00:33:44,572 --> 00:33:47,063
the reason you decided
to join a gang?

622
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,735
Oh...

623
00:33:50,211 --> 00:33:52,111
poor little rich girl
needs the gang...

624
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,943
as mi familia. That's funny.

625
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:56,973
Someone once said
friends are just God's way...

626
00:33:57,018 --> 00:33:59,384
of apologizing for family.

627
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,785
How can I complain?

628
00:34:00,822 --> 00:34:02,949
If I say one word, it's, like...

629
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:05,458
"Look at your life. There are
people starving in India."

630
00:34:05,493 --> 00:34:08,792
There are people starving
in Santa Monica, you know.

631
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:11,128
I thought they take them
downtown to starve.

632
00:34:11,165 --> 00:34:15,534
All I'm saying is, you know,
that's not an excuse.

633
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,095
I'm not making excuses.

634
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,834
Hey, you don't have
to get angry about it.

635
00:34:19,874 --> 00:34:21,398
I'm just interviewing you.

636
00:34:21,442 --> 00:34:23,307
I'm not getting angry.

637
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,507
Let me ask you something.

638
00:34:27,548 --> 00:34:29,675
Hypothetically...

639
00:34:29,717 --> 00:34:32,208
is it... possible...

640
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,585
that all... this...

641
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:38,251
is really about you...

642
00:34:38,292 --> 00:34:41,784
being attracted to me?

643
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,091
Heh.

644
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:49,001
Maybe. I don't know.

645
00:34:49,036 --> 00:34:51,163
Oh, I think you do.

646
00:34:51,205 --> 00:34:52,968
You're a smart guy.

647
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,703
You just don't know
if I feel the same way...

648
00:34:55,743 --> 00:34:57,301
so...

649
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,643
you're playing hard-to-get
in your guy way.

650
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,477
It's so dishonest.

651
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,677
Have you noticed
that when you get serious...

652
00:35:03,718 --> 00:35:06,710
you stop talking all, you know,
street and dope and shit?

653
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:08,016
Step, muthafucka!

654
00:35:08,055 --> 00:35:10,046
I'm kickin' it old school.

655
00:35:10,091 --> 00:35:13,254
A big shout-out
to all of your Gs in the house!

656
00:35:13,294 --> 00:35:16,127
Yeah, dawg!

657
00:35:16,164 --> 00:35:17,153
Heh.

658
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,428
Oh. Oh,
but you don't like that...

659
00:35:19,467 --> 00:35:21,264
all street and dope and shit.

660
00:35:21,302 --> 00:35:23,600
Oh, God. Um... OK.

661
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:25,629
How's this?

662
00:35:38,486 --> 00:35:42,047
The Grateful Dead, dude.

663
00:35:42,089 --> 00:35:45,081
1989, The Greek Theatre.

664
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:47,526
Uhh ha ha.

665
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,929
Oh, we had the kindest Humboldt.

666
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:52,899
It... it...

667
00:35:52,934 --> 00:35:55,129
Mmm.

668
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:57,433
I found God. Heh.

669
00:35:57,471 --> 00:36:00,872
I can be lots of people.
I can be like you.

670
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:02,205
Hmm.

671
00:36:03,611 --> 00:36:07,308
Gee, Dr. McConnelly, your...

672
00:36:07,348 --> 00:36:10,374
position on cultural ethics
is fascinating...

673
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,319
and really applies
to the post-Clinton era...

674
00:36:13,354 --> 00:36:14,514
in American politics.

675
00:36:14,555 --> 00:36:16,523
I... just...

676
00:36:16,557 --> 00:36:19,651
I just can't wait
till I'm old enough to vote!

677
00:36:19,694 --> 00:36:21,958
Allison...

678
00:36:21,996 --> 00:36:24,794
do you want to be
a dierent person?

679
00:36:24,832 --> 00:36:26,663
Do you want to make love to me?

680
00:36:26,701 --> 00:36:28,168
No, seriously, though.

681
00:36:28,202 --> 00:36:30,432
Isn't this what all the clothes
and the talk...

682
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:33,565
you know,
isn't that what it's all about?

683
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,974
No, seriously.

684
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:40,140
Do you want to fuck me?

685
00:36:43,684 --> 00:36:45,675
I'm just trying
to get to know you here.

686
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,745
And you're acting
like a porn star.

687
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,756
Oh, God, my nipples are hard!

688
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,657
Oh, God! Oh, God!

689
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:55,719
Oh, my God, Eric.

690
00:36:55,763 --> 00:37:00,132
Eric, hooking up with you
would feel so good. Ohh...

691
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:01,930
Do you ever take
anything seriously?

692
00:37:03,738 --> 00:37:06,536
How do you know
I'm not taking this seriously?

693
00:37:06,574 --> 00:37:07,700
Ha ha!

694
00:37:07,742 --> 00:37:09,801
Because this is
a fucked-up power game.

695
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:13,609
Games are fun.

696
00:37:14,849 --> 00:37:18,012
Could... could you
cover up, please?

697
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:27,221
Well, that's great footage, huh?

698
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:29,661
That'll really get
the math team going.

699
00:37:31,132 --> 00:37:33,498
Yeah. Thanks.

700
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,202
You know...

701
00:37:44,445 --> 00:37:45,810
What?

702
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,643
It's nothing.

703
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:51,311
No, Eric.
What were you gonna say?

704
00:37:52,586 --> 00:37:54,486
Come on, I don't want
to hurt your feelings.

705
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,990
You're gonna hurt
my feelings? Heh.

706
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,254
Come on. Say it.

707
00:37:59,293 --> 00:38:01,454
No, it's just...

708
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,189
You're one of the loneliest people
I've ever met.

709
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,309
What you doin' around here...

710
00:39:32,353 --> 00:39:35,220
Iooking all homegirl and shit?

711
00:39:36,724 --> 00:39:39,249
I always dress like this.

712
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,625
Oh, yeah? Wow.

713
00:39:41,662 --> 00:39:43,721
Here I am, trying to look
like I got the money...

714
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,096
and you're tryin'
to look like me.

715
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,101
Fuckin' white people.

716
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,136
So, you shoppin'
like the other night?

717
00:39:51,172 --> 00:39:53,367
'Cause you know
I got the real shit, huh?

718
00:39:53,407 --> 00:39:54,897
No. I'm just lookin'.

719
00:39:54,942 --> 00:39:56,910
You just looking, huh?

720
00:39:56,944 --> 00:40:00,311
Yeah, so am I.
I'm just looking, too.

721
00:40:08,622 --> 00:40:09,714
Aah!

722
00:40:09,757 --> 00:40:10,849
Hey, Hector!

723
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,791
Hey, why do you hang out here
all the time?

724
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,493
I mean, couldn't you make
more money somewhere else?

725
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,433
Somewhere else?

726
00:40:21,469 --> 00:40:25,269
Where the fuck
you want me to be at, huh?

727
00:40:25,306 --> 00:40:28,400
Beverly Hills,
sell some rock on Rodeo Drive?

728
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:30,239
It's my world right here.

729
00:40:30,277 --> 00:40:32,302
It's my home. It's where I live.

730
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,246
I got my homeys. I got my rucas.

731
00:40:34,281 --> 00:40:37,341
Who the fuck am I
someplace else, huh?

732
00:40:37,384 --> 00:40:39,375
Oh, hey, what's up?

733
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:43,551
Money comes to me, girl.

734
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:45,991
You make it sound
too fuckin' easy.

735
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,324
Hmm. Oh, you think so?

736
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,795
Shit.

737
00:41:28,936 --> 00:41:31,666
You know what
the most fucked up thing is?

738
00:41:31,705 --> 00:41:32,967
What?

739
00:41:33,007 --> 00:41:34,804
People come around here
and they think...

740
00:41:34,842 --> 00:41:37,072
that all we do
is sell drugs here, you know?

741
00:41:37,111 --> 00:41:39,136
People live here.
People grow up here.

742
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,444
You know? Look up there.

743
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:43,450
My Tia Maria lives up there.

744
00:41:43,484 --> 00:41:45,577
I got a few primos
who live over there.

745
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:47,086
What's a primo?

746
00:41:47,121 --> 00:41:49,453
Primo's a cousin.

747
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:50,514
Got it.

748
00:41:50,558 --> 00:41:52,185
Hey.

749
00:41:54,361 --> 00:41:55,623
Hey, hey...

750
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:58,564
don't talk dirty, homes.
She's here with me.

751
00:42:00,034 --> 00:42:01,729
She didn't fuck you last time.

752
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,396
You think she's gonna
fuck you this time?

753
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:04,563
Hey, hey.

754
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,504
Leave her alone, homes.

755
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:21,549
I don't think your friend
likes me.

756
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:23,523
He's my brother.

757
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,525
He's my older brother.

758
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:27,550
He's big-time here.

759
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:33,928
Listen, I want to
show you something.

760
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,026
Come here.

761
00:42:37,271 --> 00:42:38,295
Heh heh.

762
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:43,839
Come here. Have a seat.

763
00:42:49,383 --> 00:42:52,352
I want you to be
my eyes with me.

764
00:42:52,386 --> 00:42:53,876
Lookit.

765
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,516
Every... body...
smokes... rock.

766
00:42:57,558 --> 00:43:01,016
Rock doesn't only get
the poor people o.

767
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:04,497
You got everything...
got Mercedes, got BMW...

768
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,460
¡Vámonos!

769
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:16,372
L.A.P.D.! Stay where you are!

770
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:17,399
Oh, fuck!

771
00:43:17,444 --> 00:43:19,878
Hands where I can see 'em!

772
00:43:19,913 --> 00:43:21,904
Come on, now, girl.
Let me see your hands.

773
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,143
Chino.

774
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,310
Hands on your head.
Interlace your fingers.

775
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:26,717
Put 'em on the back
of your head.

776
00:43:26,754 --> 00:43:28,551
Let's go, Hector.
Spit out the cigarette.

777
00:43:28,589 --> 00:43:30,250
Spit it out.

778
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:31,280
Easy. Come on.

779
00:43:31,325 --> 00:43:32,758
Let's go. This way.

780
00:43:32,793 --> 00:43:34,761
Let's see those hands.

781
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:36,092
Turn around.
Up against the fence.

782
00:43:38,899 --> 00:43:40,764
Let's go. Keep moving.

783
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:47,968
Spread your legs.

784
00:43:50,978 --> 00:43:52,377
Spread 'em.

785
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:55,181
You got some I.D.?

786
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:57,477
Yeah.

787
00:43:57,518 --> 00:43:59,645
Is there anything in here...
Hands on your head!

788
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:01,917
Is there anything in here
I need to know about?

789
00:44:01,955 --> 00:44:04,355
- No.
- Knife? Needles? Gun?

790
00:44:06,794 --> 00:44:08,193
Pacific Palisades.

791
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,753
You get lost
looking for Hollywood?

792
00:44:10,798 --> 00:44:13,858
Spit it out! Spit it out!

793
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,459
Spit it out!

794
00:44:15,502 --> 00:44:18,266
What we got?
Forty worth of rock.

795
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:21,365
You should've swallowed it, Ace.
You're under arrest.

796
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,602
Yeah, I got something
you can swallow.

797
00:44:22,643 --> 00:44:25,305
Come on, I want to talk with
you. You can drop 'em.

798
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:29,477
Look, just tell me the truth.

799
00:44:29,516 --> 00:44:31,347
No. Listen, l... I stopped
to ask for directions...

800
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:32,784
because... I missed
the 10 by accident...

801
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,846
OK, that's it. You're underage,
you're loitering...

802
00:44:35,889 --> 00:44:37,914
and you're going
down to the station.

803
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:39,050
Oh, my...

804
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,458
Get in the car!

805
00:44:40,494 --> 00:44:42,257
Watch your head.

806
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:49,329
The cop started asking me
these really stupid questions...

807
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:53,602
like, what's closer to you now...
the moon or Europe?

808
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:56,404
Fuck you is closer to me now.

809
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,911
I've been to Knott's Berry Farm.

810
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,311
Ha ha ha ha!

811
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:03,043
What'd you do?

812
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,746
Hmm? Me?

813
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,619
No, the debutante
sitting next to you.

814
00:45:08,655 --> 00:45:11,215
Fuck. Vice cop asked me
where my dick is.

815
00:45:11,258 --> 00:45:14,022
Darling, I did Axl Rose...

816
00:45:14,061 --> 00:45:16,552
and you don't get him
with a dick down there.

817
00:45:22,002 --> 00:45:24,095
You don't got any Dilaudid
shoved up your ass...

818
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,605
to get her to stop doing that.

819
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:26,970
Heh. No.

820
00:45:28,409 --> 00:45:29,637
Positive?

821
00:45:31,712 --> 00:45:33,612
You can check if you like.

822
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,444
Ha ha ha ha!

823
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,076
Ha ha ha ha ha!

824
00:45:38,118 --> 00:45:41,053
Yeah. In your dreams.

825
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:48,216
Allison Lang?

826
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,320
Yeah.

827
00:45:49,363 --> 00:45:50,955
Your parents are here.

828
00:45:56,403 --> 00:45:57,927
Bitch got parents?

829
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:10,881
You got arrested!
With crack dealers!

830
00:46:21,455 --> 00:46:25,721
Maybe this hasn't been
the easiest place to live lately.

831
00:46:31,565 --> 00:46:34,500
All right.
Then we talk about it.

832
00:46:34,535 --> 00:46:36,503
That's what we're
supposed to do.

833
00:46:36,537 --> 00:46:39,165
One of us has a problem,
we all talk it over.

834
00:46:39,206 --> 00:46:41,504
Oh, right. Who are you kidding?

835
00:46:41,542 --> 00:46:44,375
Who could ever talk to you
when you're never even here?

836
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:46,607
Well, I'm gonna make it
easy for you to find me.

837
00:46:46,647 --> 00:46:47,773
You're grounded.

838
00:46:47,815 --> 00:46:49,874
Hasn't she already
suered enough...

839
00:46:49,917 --> 00:46:52,613
And besides,
what good would it do?

840
00:46:52,653 --> 00:46:54,348
Wha...

841
00:46:54,388 --> 00:46:56,447
I don't want any soup, Mom.

842
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:59,254
What were you doing downtown
in the first place?

843
00:47:00,928 --> 00:47:03,021
I was sick of this phony life.

844
00:47:03,064 --> 00:47:04,895
All right, stop it, stop it,
both of you.

845
00:47:04,932 --> 00:47:06,866
This whole thing
is just gonna go away.

846
00:47:08,736 --> 00:47:10,966
Tomato or chicken with rice?

847
00:47:14,875 --> 00:47:17,435
Alli, you're so fucking down.

848
00:47:17,478 --> 00:47:19,207
Like, doing hard time and shit?

849
00:47:19,246 --> 00:47:21,942
No. No, it wasn't like that.

850
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:23,347
Come on. I heard
that you hit a cop...

851
00:47:23,384 --> 00:47:24,817
and you got
into a knife fight.

852
00:47:24,852 --> 00:47:28,151
No. No, no, guys.
It was more like... detention.

853
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:29,588
See ya later.

854
00:47:30,758 --> 00:47:32,385
Bye.

855
00:47:32,426 --> 00:47:34,758
Heh. So, I wonder
what Daddy thought.

856
00:47:34,795 --> 00:47:37,958
Please. Daddy waved
his magic wand and it went away.

857
00:47:39,033 --> 00:47:40,967
- Whoa.
- What's your problem?

858
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:42,798
Hey, what the fuck
is this I'm hearing?

859
00:47:44,038 --> 00:47:46,529
Yo, she was in lockup,
motherfucker. What?

860
00:47:46,574 --> 00:47:49,372
Well, going to jail
is fucked up.

861
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:51,674
What? It was juvenile
detention center.

862
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:54,044
Did you go back down
to that fucking spot?

863
00:47:56,317 --> 00:47:57,511
Huh?

864
00:47:57,551 --> 00:48:00,076
Hey, shorty,
you gettin' a rap sheet?

865
00:48:00,121 --> 00:48:03,215
The man gonna be fuckin'
three-strikin' your ass, kid.

866
00:48:03,257 --> 00:48:04,815
How you gonna rep it
without the P.L.C., huh?

867
00:48:04,859 --> 00:48:07,919
Yo, maybe she don't need
the P.L.C., motherfucker.

868
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:10,089
Fucking P.L.C.
Is the only family we got.

869
00:48:10,131 --> 00:48:11,962
Ooh, I'm scared now.

870
00:48:11,999 --> 00:48:14,797
- Let's bounce.
- Why you gotta be like that?

871
00:48:16,637 --> 00:48:18,969
They don't even know
what family is.

872
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:21,130
You don't want to think
that you're with someone...

873
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:23,439
just because everyone else
thinks you should be...

874
00:48:23,477 --> 00:48:25,502
because we're not assigned
to people like, you know...

875
00:48:25,546 --> 00:48:27,776
parking spaces, and, um...

876
00:48:27,815 --> 00:48:30,010
and you do love him, you know?

877
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:32,518
I mean... God,
you've known him forever...

878
00:48:32,553 --> 00:48:36,819
and he's great and fun,
and it makes sense, and...

879
00:48:38,159 --> 00:48:40,252
So, yeah, the whole thing
seems predetermined...

880
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:42,421
but, um...

881
00:48:43,831 --> 00:48:46,129
Heh. You find yourself, like...

882
00:48:46,167 --> 00:48:49,728
giving him a blow job,
and it feels like a performance.

883
00:48:51,438 --> 00:48:52,803
OK, it is a performance.

884
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:54,865
But, um, ha ha ha!

885
00:48:54,909 --> 00:48:57,537
Um, what I mean is that...

886
00:48:58,846 --> 00:49:01,406
that you can't, like...

887
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:02,972
feel it.

888
00:49:04,251 --> 00:49:06,481
It doesn't even seem real.
It seems like a dream...

889
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,044
like you're just...

890
00:49:09,890 --> 00:49:13,382
sleepwalking through your life,
you know?

891
00:49:13,427 --> 00:49:14,826
Does that make any sense?

892
00:49:14,862 --> 00:49:16,261
Yeah.

893
00:49:17,765 --> 00:49:20,825
But what...
what isn't a dream?

894
00:49:20,868 --> 00:49:22,426
OK.

895
00:49:23,837 --> 00:49:25,771
Um...

896
00:49:25,806 --> 00:49:28,536
the other night,
I was with Emily...

897
00:49:28,576 --> 00:49:30,737
and we were at
this crazy party downtown...

898
00:49:30,778 --> 00:49:32,712
and...

899
00:49:34,348 --> 00:49:35,508
I don't know.

900
00:49:35,549 --> 00:49:38,109
We just sat there
together and...

901
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:39,585
And what?

902
00:49:41,021 --> 00:49:43,046
I don't know.

903
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:45,524
I just love her, you know?

904
00:49:45,559 --> 00:49:47,151
It seemed real.

905
00:49:52,333 --> 00:49:55,325
So, what was it like in there?

906
00:49:55,369 --> 00:49:58,099
It was totally fuckin' real.

907
00:49:58,138 --> 00:49:59,571
It smelled like puke...

908
00:49:59,607 --> 00:50:01,541
and it was so bright,
it made my eyes hurt.

909
00:50:01,575 --> 00:50:03,873
And there were
these hookers in there...

910
00:50:03,911 --> 00:50:06,607
and it was, like,
business as usual for them.

911
00:50:06,647 --> 00:50:09,480
And this one white chick...

912
00:50:09,516 --> 00:50:12,952
who thought
she was super-bad, but...

913
00:50:12,987 --> 00:50:16,218
I think she just wanted
to appropriate my wardrobe.

914
00:50:16,257 --> 00:50:19,192
Heh. I love your nails.

915
00:50:19,226 --> 00:50:20,557
Were you scared?

916
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:23,791
Oh, I was scared shit.

917
00:50:23,831 --> 00:50:25,423
I don't know.

918
00:50:25,466 --> 00:50:28,094
I was helpless, but...

919
00:50:28,135 --> 00:50:29,898
excited.

920
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,369
What if it's, like...

921
00:50:34,408 --> 00:50:36,808
we're on our deathbeds...

922
00:50:36,844 --> 00:50:38,675
and we're looking back
at our lives...

923
00:50:38,712 --> 00:50:40,475
and, like, all the guys
we've, like, loved...

924
00:50:40,514 --> 00:50:42,345
and just, like, fucked, and...

925
00:50:42,383 --> 00:50:46,046
and it turns out that,
like, the whole time...

926
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:49,522
like, we were supposed
to be together?

927
00:50:54,795 --> 00:50:56,990
Aah! Aah! Oh, my God!

928
00:50:57,031 --> 00:50:58,157
Oh!

929
00:50:58,198 --> 00:51:00,530
Heh.

930
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:10,240
I don't think
I could go down on you.

931
00:51:11,745 --> 00:51:13,770
- Ha!
- Ha ha ha!

932
00:51:13,814 --> 00:51:15,042
Mmm.

933
00:51:16,116 --> 00:51:18,016
It's OK.

934
00:51:18,052 --> 00:51:19,485
Mm.

935
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,612
Oh, my God.

936
00:51:20,654 --> 00:51:22,281
Oh, I can't believe
I almost forgot this.

937
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:23,551
I will be right back.

938
00:51:25,793 --> 00:51:27,420
OK. Ah.

939
00:51:27,461 --> 00:51:29,861
You're gonna love this.

940
00:51:29,897 --> 00:51:32,024
Super surprise.

941
00:51:33,534 --> 00:51:35,024
Now...

942
00:51:35,069 --> 00:51:36,366
are you ready?

943
00:51:36,403 --> 00:51:38,462
Super surprise.

944
00:51:38,505 --> 00:51:41,065
The dark dungeon, and...

945
00:51:41,108 --> 00:51:42,268
What is that?

946
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:44,368
Put out your hand.

947
00:51:45,879 --> 00:51:47,039
Crack cocaine.

948
00:51:47,081 --> 00:51:48,480
Ohh! Where did you
get this from?

949
00:51:48,515 --> 00:51:50,210
Whatever. A lady never tells.

950
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,081
Oh, my God.
Wait, how do we do it?

951
00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,610
Um... OK. So,
I called the drug hot line...

952
00:51:54,655 --> 00:51:57,886
and asked them what signs
to look for if my mom smoked crack.

953
00:51:57,925 --> 00:52:00,917
They said little pieces
of aluminum foil everywhere.

954
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:02,189
So...

955
00:52:02,229 --> 00:52:03,890
you want to try it, right?

956
00:52:03,931 --> 00:52:06,263
- Yeah.
- All right. Cool.

957
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,200
Ready?

958
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,337
You're such a crackhead.

959
00:52:11,372 --> 00:52:12,771
We are such crackheads.

960
00:52:12,806 --> 00:52:15,798
OK. Oh, shit! Go!
Just inhale it! Just...

961
00:52:15,843 --> 00:52:18,073
Aah! Shit!

962
00:52:18,112 --> 00:52:19,170
Shit, where'd it go?

963
00:52:19,213 --> 00:52:21,147
It splattered.
It got me right there.

964
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:23,274
Ohh... ohh.

965
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:25,683
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Mmm!

966
00:52:25,719 --> 00:52:27,414
Whitney's right...

967
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:29,513
- crack is wack.
- Crack is wack.

968
00:52:29,556 --> 00:52:31,217
Shit. Yeah, it is.

969
00:52:31,258 --> 00:52:32,418
Oh, my God.

970
00:52:32,459 --> 00:52:33,687
That was fun.

971
00:52:34,862 --> 00:52:36,625
Hmm.

972
00:52:36,663 --> 00:52:39,325
I want to go downtown with you.

973
00:52:39,366 --> 00:52:40,458
You do?

974
00:52:41,902 --> 00:52:42,891
Yeah, I don't know.

975
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:44,369
I just want to,
like, feel it...

976
00:52:44,405 --> 00:52:46,032
and... I don't know.

977
00:52:47,374 --> 00:52:50,571
Well, fuck you... bitch.

978
00:52:50,611 --> 00:52:52,169
¶ Bounce with me,
bounce with me¶

979
00:52:52,212 --> 00:52:54,112
Yo, tomorrow, after school!

980
00:52:54,148 --> 00:52:55,740
- Really?
- Yeah.

981
00:52:55,783 --> 00:52:57,808
¶ You don't gotta be rich,
but fuck that¶

982
00:52:57,851 --> 00:52:59,978
¶ How we gonna get around
on your bus pass¶?

983
00:53:00,020 --> 00:53:01,783
¶ Before I put this pussy
on your moustache¶

984
00:53:01,822 --> 00:53:03,289
¶ Can you aord me¶?

985
00:53:03,323 --> 00:53:05,450
¶ My niggas breadwinners,
never poor¶

986
00:53:05,492 --> 00:53:07,392
¶ Ambition gets me so horny¶

987
00:53:07,428 --> 00:53:09,123
¶ Not the fussin'
and the frontin'¶

988
00:53:09,163 --> 00:53:10,721
¶ If you got nothin', baby boy¶

989
00:53:10,764 --> 00:53:13,062
¶ You gotta get up, get out,
get somethin'¶

990
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:15,000
¶ Shit, I like a lotta Prada¶

991
00:53:15,035 --> 00:53:16,525
¶ Alize and rock¶

992
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:19,038
¶ Late nights, candlelight,
can I get a cock¶?

993
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:31,976
- Hey.
- Hey, Hector.

994
00:53:37,624 --> 00:53:40,092
I'm down. OK?

995
00:53:40,127 --> 00:53:41,822
16th Street por vida.

996
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:13,790
Ha ha!

997
00:54:32,779 --> 00:54:34,542
OK...

998
00:54:36,917 --> 00:54:39,181
that's the house.

999
00:54:39,219 --> 00:54:40,914
All right.

1000
00:54:40,954 --> 00:54:43,718
You look very hot. Let's go.

1001
00:54:54,868 --> 00:54:56,927
Hey, what are you doing here?

1002
00:54:56,970 --> 00:54:58,665
Stop right there.

1003
00:55:00,407 --> 00:55:01,840
Hey, what the fuck, eh?

1004
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,343
They took us downtown
and held us for two hours.

1005
00:55:04,378 --> 00:55:06,312
They thought they could get
something outta you.

1006
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,837
- I don't know anything.
- She didn't say shit.

1007
00:55:11,585 --> 00:55:14,281
Slow down, white girl.
I know she didn't...

1008
00:55:14,321 --> 00:55:15,879
because they didn't arrest us.

1009
00:55:18,692 --> 00:55:20,557
Check it out.
This is a party for Javy.

1010
00:55:20,594 --> 00:55:22,118
He just got baptized.

1011
00:55:22,162 --> 00:55:25,188
Oh. Is he your baby?

1012
00:55:25,232 --> 00:55:27,132
No.

1013
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:29,533
- No?
- Mm-mm.

1014
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:32,505
But we're gonna be kicking it
at the Alvarado a little later.

1015
00:55:32,539 --> 00:55:34,404
Maybe, like,
in about a half an hour.

1016
00:55:35,776 --> 00:55:37,801
So we'll see you there?

1017
00:55:37,844 --> 00:55:39,072
Yeah.

1018
00:55:41,081 --> 00:55:42,412
Later.

1019
00:55:42,449 --> 00:55:43,677
Órale.

1020
00:55:43,717 --> 00:55:45,014
Bye.

1021
00:56:10,510 --> 00:56:12,239
What up, chump? Yeah!

1022
00:56:12,279 --> 00:56:14,577
What's up? What's up, Sleepy?!

1023
00:56:15,816 --> 00:56:17,215
Cerveza?

1024
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:18,478
Thanks.

1025
00:56:46,346 --> 00:56:47,472
Let's roll.

1026
00:56:47,514 --> 00:56:49,072
Yeah.

1027
00:56:52,653 --> 00:56:55,315
- Who's your papi?
- Joto.

1028
00:57:00,961 --> 00:57:04,124
Get him a fuckin' calculator,
this motherfucker right here.

1029
00:57:04,164 --> 00:57:05,563
Ha ha ha!

1030
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:06,998
Twenty.

1031
00:57:07,034 --> 00:57:09,002
Bullshit.

1032
00:57:09,036 --> 00:57:10,060
Aah!

1033
00:57:10,103 --> 00:57:11,229
Aah!

1034
00:57:11,271 --> 00:57:12,966
- Oh!
- Oh!

1035
00:57:13,006 --> 00:57:15,839
I want to do the next one.

1036
00:57:15,876 --> 00:57:18,208
OK, here we go.

1037
00:57:26,887 --> 00:57:27,945
Mexican.

1038
00:57:27,988 --> 00:57:29,455
- Ooh!
- Oh!

1039
00:57:29,489 --> 00:57:30,786
I believe!

1040
00:57:31,858 --> 00:57:33,985
I think it's bullshit.

1041
00:57:40,867 --> 00:57:42,562
I don't lie.

1042
00:57:42,602 --> 00:57:43,626
Ohh...

1043
00:57:43,670 --> 00:57:45,103
- You gotta drink.
- Whoo!

1044
00:57:45,138 --> 00:57:46,332
Drink it, homes, drink it!

1045
00:57:46,373 --> 00:57:47,533
Here you go.

1046
00:57:47,574 --> 00:57:49,508
Ha ha.

1047
00:57:49,543 --> 00:57:52,103
- Whoo! Very nice.
- That's hot.

1048
00:57:52,145 --> 00:57:53,169
Órale.

1049
00:57:54,581 --> 00:57:56,845
Oh, I'm gonna get you
so drunk tonight.

1050
00:57:56,883 --> 00:57:58,316
Ha ha ha ha!

1051
00:57:58,351 --> 00:57:59,545
Oh, shit.

1052
00:57:59,586 --> 00:58:01,053
We'll see about that.

1053
00:58:03,457 --> 00:58:05,220
You're her bitch, homes.

1054
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:15,393
- Go! Go!
- Whoo!

1055
00:58:15,435 --> 00:58:17,130
Do that shit, man!

1056
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:19,138
- Oh. Get it!
- Go!

1057
00:58:19,172 --> 00:58:20,764
Órale.

1058
00:58:23,944 --> 00:58:27,880
¡Chupando como la 16th Street,
cabrones!

1059
00:58:27,914 --> 00:58:29,211
Órale, vato.

1060
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:32,942
Hey...

1061
00:58:32,986 --> 00:58:35,477
can you ask?

1062
00:58:35,522 --> 00:58:36,750
You ask.

1063
00:58:36,790 --> 00:58:38,121
I can't.

1064
00:58:38,158 --> 00:58:39,250
Why? Why can't you ask?

1065
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:40,657
- No, come on. You.
- No.

1066
00:58:40,694 --> 00:58:41,956
- You.
- No.

1067
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:44,429
They like you better.

1068
00:58:44,464 --> 00:58:47,092
OK. OK.

1069
00:58:47,134 --> 00:58:50,365
Um... I got to ask you
a question.

1070
00:58:50,403 --> 00:58:54,772
We were wondering
if we could join your crew.

1071
00:58:56,877 --> 00:58:58,742
Wh-what?

1072
00:58:58,779 --> 00:59:00,440
I mean, you know,
like, hang out with you...

1073
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:02,641
like... hmm...
yeah, be in your crew.

1074
00:59:07,154 --> 00:59:08,746
You mean you want to join 16th?

1075
00:59:08,789 --> 00:59:10,757
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

1076
00:59:10,791 --> 00:59:12,088
Be all down and shit...

1077
00:59:12,125 --> 00:59:14,389
like a fuckin' O.G.
In the house? Huh?

1078
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:16,361
Yo, we're down, you know.
We just thought...

1079
00:59:16,396 --> 00:59:18,626
- Are you gonna work a corner?
- Ha ha!

1080
00:59:18,665 --> 00:59:21,566
Huh? Move a little rock
o Bonnie Brae...

1081
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:23,694
like an after school job?

1082
00:59:23,737 --> 00:59:25,034
How about Beverly Hills?

1083
00:59:25,071 --> 00:59:27,266
Maybe you can open up
a fuckin' franchise, huh?

1084
00:59:27,307 --> 00:59:29,571
- Fuck you.
- Oh, shit.

1085
00:59:29,609 --> 00:59:31,543
Oh, that's some
fucked up shit, homes.

1086
00:59:31,578 --> 00:59:33,705
Ha ha!

1087
00:59:33,747 --> 00:59:35,237
No, no, no, no.

1088
00:59:35,282 --> 00:59:38,183
Not fuck me.

1089
00:59:42,355 --> 00:59:45,051
She wants to join 16th.
What do you think about that?

1090
00:59:45,091 --> 00:59:47,321
Hey, pendejo...

1091
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:55,165
What? OK, you know what?

1092
00:59:55,202 --> 00:59:57,136
You want to make fun of us?
We're gone.

1093
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,831
Hey, gabacha.

1094
00:59:58,872 --> 01:00:00,066
My name's Allison.

1095
01:00:00,106 --> 01:00:03,007
- Allison.
- Ooh.

1096
01:00:03,043 --> 01:00:04,874
Allison.

1097
01:00:04,911 --> 01:00:06,469
Allison.

1098
01:00:09,316 --> 01:00:12,649
So you want to set
16th Street, huh?

1099
01:00:12,686 --> 01:00:16,281
Well, you gotta do it like
every other lady here, girl.

1100
01:00:18,058 --> 01:00:19,821
Well, what do we gotta do?

1101
01:00:22,462 --> 01:00:25,295
It's a dice game.

1102
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,495
You got to...

1103
01:00:28,535 --> 01:00:31,299
you got to do it
with our people.

1104
01:00:31,338 --> 01:00:33,863
You know what I mean?

1105
01:00:33,907 --> 01:00:36,034
You understand?

1106
01:00:36,076 --> 01:00:37,373
Do it.

1107
01:00:37,410 --> 01:00:39,037
Heh! Stop!

1108
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:41,343
Each of you rolls one time...

1109
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:43,110
but whatever number you get...

1110
01:00:43,149 --> 01:00:45,413
that's the number
of my friends you take...

1111
01:00:45,452 --> 01:00:46,646
in there.

1112
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:47,710
Ha ha!

1113
01:00:48,855 --> 01:00:49,981
Heh.

1114
01:00:52,893 --> 01:00:54,190
OK.

1115
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:59,695
But I choose the friends.

1116
01:00:59,733 --> 01:01:01,667
Ooh. Look out.

1117
01:01:06,473 --> 01:01:07,963
All right.

1118
01:01:08,008 --> 01:01:10,169
Órale! Ha ha ha!

1119
01:01:11,611 --> 01:01:12,805
Come on.

1120
01:01:18,151 --> 01:01:19,140
Yeah, come on, man.

1121
01:01:21,221 --> 01:01:22,381
All right, man.

1122
01:01:26,626 --> 01:01:28,753
Watch me bag
that shit up, homes.

1123
01:01:32,766 --> 01:01:35,291
All right. Here we are.

1124
01:01:35,335 --> 01:01:36,996
You girls are down, right?

1125
01:01:37,037 --> 01:01:38,265
- Yeah.
- Who's going first?

1126
01:01:41,641 --> 01:01:44,007
- You?
- You.

1127
01:01:44,044 --> 01:01:45,306
I'll go first.

1128
01:01:45,345 --> 01:01:46,369
You?

1129
01:01:52,152 --> 01:01:53,551
Heh heh!

1130
01:01:54,587 --> 01:01:56,885
- Big six!
- Seven.

1131
01:01:56,923 --> 01:01:58,857
Oh, shit. Heh.

1132
01:02:00,193 --> 01:02:01,160
- Oh!
- Ohh!

1133
01:02:01,194 --> 01:02:02,627
One? Ha!

1134
01:02:02,662 --> 01:02:03,754
Just one.

1135
01:02:04,764 --> 01:02:07,324
So be thinking
about who you want, OK?

1136
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:09,629
It's your turn.

1137
01:02:09,669 --> 01:02:11,034
OK.

1138
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:15,331
Whoa. OK.

1139
01:02:16,876 --> 01:02:18,343
- Oh...
- Three?

1140
01:02:18,378 --> 01:02:20,107
- Yeah!
- Three?!

1141
01:02:20,146 --> 01:02:21,511
Big three.

1142
01:02:22,716 --> 01:02:25,810
Three is cool.
I can handle three.

1143
01:02:25,852 --> 01:02:28,252
It's just sex.

1144
01:02:29,923 --> 01:02:31,447
Well, if it's just sex...

1145
01:02:31,491 --> 01:02:33,755
who do you want
to start with first?

1146
01:02:37,197 --> 01:02:38,755
Órale.

1147
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:40,197
Ah ha!

1148
01:02:41,334 --> 01:02:43,461
All right. Hurry up, homes.

1149
01:02:47,941 --> 01:02:49,101
And you?

1150
01:03:33,286 --> 01:03:34,617
Uhh!

1151
01:03:34,654 --> 01:03:36,087
Ha ha!

1152
01:03:40,660 --> 01:03:41,684
Ha ha!

1153
01:03:52,939 --> 01:03:54,372
Mmm!

1154
01:04:27,507 --> 01:04:29,805
Uh... stop.

1155
01:04:29,843 --> 01:04:31,242
I'm so sorry.

1156
01:04:31,277 --> 01:04:32,608
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

1157
01:04:32,645 --> 01:04:34,510
I can't... I can't do it.

1158
01:04:36,483 --> 01:04:38,883
No. Please.

1159
01:04:38,918 --> 01:04:40,818
No. Please. Please.

1160
01:04:51,731 --> 01:04:53,892
Em? Em, we can go.

1161
01:04:54,234 --> 01:04:56,099
Ohh! I'm doing this.

1162
01:04:56,136 --> 01:04:58,866
What? No, Em. Come on.
OK, listen to me.

1163
01:04:58,905 --> 01:05:00,998
All I ever do
is listen to you. Ha!

1164
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,029
Fuck it. Let's go.

1165
01:05:02,075 --> 01:05:03,565
All right? Let's go. Come on.

1166
01:05:03,610 --> 01:05:04,975
Get the fuck out of here.

1167
01:05:05,011 --> 01:05:06,569
Listen, he said we could go, OK?

1168
01:05:06,613 --> 01:05:09,138
We're going, Emily.
Just... We gotta...

1169
01:05:09,182 --> 01:05:10,649
No, I'm doing this.

1170
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,652
And I want Hector first.

1171
01:05:16,689 --> 01:05:18,122
Just let me do my thing.

1172
01:05:25,498 --> 01:05:26,556
Let's go.

1173
01:05:26,599 --> 01:05:28,066
No. Emily...

1174
01:05:28,101 --> 01:05:29,295
Let's go.

1175
01:05:29,335 --> 01:05:30,632
What the f...

1176
01:05:54,460 --> 01:05:58,396
- Yeah.
- Ah ha ha! Ahh!

1177
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:07,831
Ohh. Harder. Harder.

1178
01:06:10,410 --> 01:06:11,672
Harder.

1179
01:06:25,959 --> 01:06:28,723
Ohh! Stop!

1180
01:06:28,761 --> 01:06:30,854
Ohh! Stop it! Stop!

1181
01:06:30,897 --> 01:06:33,127
What the fuck
is wrong with you?! Bitch!

1182
01:06:34,801 --> 01:06:36,530
Emily?

1183
01:06:36,569 --> 01:06:37,866
Emily? Oh, my God.

1184
01:06:37,904 --> 01:06:38,962
- Emily? Emily!
- No! No!

1185
01:06:39,005 --> 01:06:40,199
No, it's me! Emily!

1186
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:41,673
- No!
- Shh, shh.

1187
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,300
Look at me. Look at me.

1188
01:06:43,343 --> 01:06:45,208
- Shh. It's me.
- Aah!

1189
01:06:45,245 --> 01:06:47,236
OK? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1190
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,747
¡Eres loca!

1191
01:06:48,781 --> 01:06:50,612
It's OK, it's OK.

1192
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:52,584
I'm here. It's me. It's OK.

1193
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,678
You're OK. You're OK.

1194
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:56,621
What the fuck is it
with you two?

1195
01:06:56,656 --> 01:06:57,884
What do you fuckin' want?!

1196
01:07:00,526 --> 01:07:01,754
It's OK.

1197
01:07:01,794 --> 01:07:03,159
Let's go home, OK?

1198
01:07:10,837 --> 01:07:12,862
OK. It's OK.

1199
01:07:16,142 --> 01:07:17,632
I'm so sorry.

1200
01:08:06,025 --> 01:08:07,219
Hey.

1201
01:08:08,428 --> 01:08:09,861
You know...

1202
01:08:13,232 --> 01:08:16,224
you can hardly see
the mountains.

1203
01:08:16,269 --> 01:08:18,703
Because of the clouds.

1204
01:08:18,738 --> 01:08:21,673
I think it's snow on Mulholland.

1205
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:23,573
Smog in Encino.

1206
01:08:23,609 --> 01:08:26,601
How do people live out there?

1207
01:08:29,549 --> 01:08:31,779
How do they live here?

1208
01:08:39,726 --> 01:08:43,423
OK, so, you're all aware that
the government bailed out...

1209
01:08:43,463 --> 01:08:45,431
the savings and loan industry
in the Nineties?

1210
01:08:45,465 --> 01:08:47,433
We also talked about
the independent record label...

1211
01:08:47,467 --> 01:08:49,901
Hey. Hey, where's Emily?

1212
01:08:49,936 --> 01:08:52,063
I heard she went home sick.

1213
01:08:52,105 --> 01:08:53,436
Went home?

1214
01:08:53,473 --> 01:08:55,168
While he was serving time
in jail...

1215
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:59,736
he used his thug image to promote
a successful record company.

1216
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:02,043
Anyone see a correlation here?

1217
01:09:03,182 --> 01:09:07,551
Anyone? Allison?

1218
01:09:07,587 --> 01:09:10,181
Oh. Um...

1219
01:09:10,223 --> 01:09:13,192
both are examples
of legal profiteering...

1220
01:09:13,226 --> 01:09:15,023
from illegal activities.

1221
01:09:15,061 --> 01:09:17,359
You want to connect the dots?

1222
01:09:19,832 --> 01:09:23,324
Economics and ethics...
don't mix.

1223
01:09:23,369 --> 01:09:25,701
Um, individuals
and governments...

1224
01:09:25,738 --> 01:09:27,933
both pursue their own
self-interest...

1225
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:29,999
often, uh, carelessly...

1226
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:31,339
and...

1227
01:09:32,845 --> 01:09:36,975
no one's really willing to take
responsibility for anything.

1228
01:09:37,016 --> 01:09:38,415
Good.

1229
01:09:45,224 --> 01:09:47,158
Em?

1230
01:09:47,193 --> 01:09:49,855
Em, are you there? Pick up.

1231
01:09:54,567 --> 01:09:56,694
OK.

1232
01:09:56,736 --> 01:09:59,830
Call me, please.

1233
01:09:59,872 --> 01:10:01,169
Bye.

1234
01:10:11,584 --> 01:10:13,051
Oh, Alli.

1235
01:10:13,085 --> 01:10:15,918
- Alli.
- Yeah. What?

1236
01:10:15,955 --> 01:10:17,479
I want to talk to you.

1237
01:10:17,523 --> 01:10:20,686
You know I'm here for you.

1238
01:10:20,726 --> 01:10:22,387
Tha-thanks, Mom.
I just gotta...

1239
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:23,554
I don't understand.

1240
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:25,587
Why were you downtown... there?

1241
01:10:25,631 --> 01:10:29,931
What about your real life...
something to challenge you?

1242
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:31,231
You know, you've always
been into art...

1243
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,760
and I thought that maybe
we could do something...

1244
01:10:32,805 --> 01:10:34,363
Hey, Mom, listen.
I'm sorry...

1245
01:10:34,407 --> 01:10:36,136
if I've been stressing
you out lately. It's...

1246
01:10:36,175 --> 01:10:37,335
- Oh, baby.
- I'm OK...

1247
01:10:39,979 --> 01:10:41,776
I'll be back.

1248
01:10:41,814 --> 01:10:43,748
I love you.

1249
01:11:11,677 --> 01:11:13,406
What the fuck you doing here?

1250
01:11:14,614 --> 01:11:16,309
Look, we need to talk.
Can we just go...

1251
01:11:16,349 --> 01:11:17,873
Hey, whoa, stop.

1252
01:11:17,917 --> 01:11:19,475
Stop. Hey! Stop it.

1253
01:11:19,519 --> 01:11:21,180
Can you talk to me for a minute?

1254
01:11:22,388 --> 01:11:23,548
What the fuck you playin'?

1255
01:11:26,259 --> 01:11:27,851
What you want, gabacha?

1256
01:11:31,531 --> 01:11:33,590
Why did you do that to us
last night?

1257
01:11:33,633 --> 01:11:35,897
Do what?

1258
01:11:37,136 --> 01:11:40,572
Huh? We did exactly
what you wanted us to do.

1259
01:11:40,606 --> 01:11:42,767
You wanted in 16th Street,
and you didn't fuckin' make it.

1260
01:11:42,808 --> 01:11:44,605
Hold it. You think
that Emily wanted that?

1261
01:11:44,644 --> 01:11:46,771
Who? Emily?

1262
01:11:46,812 --> 01:11:48,541
Yeah. Yeah, you know...

1263
01:11:48,581 --> 01:11:50,412
Emily. ¿ Cuál es Emily?

1264
01:11:50,449 --> 01:11:52,383
Ohh, sí, la chiquita,
la putita, ¿ huh?

1265
01:11:52,418 --> 01:11:53,942
Yeah, yeah,
the one who got drunk...

1266
01:11:53,986 --> 01:11:55,317
and played us
like a fuckin' punk, huh?

1267
01:11:55,354 --> 01:11:57,185
No, no, no.
OK, she wasn't playing.

1268
01:11:57,223 --> 01:11:58,690
All right?
That wasn't a game to her.

1269
01:11:58,724 --> 01:12:00,624
Bullshit! Everything's
a fuckin' game to you two!

1270
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:02,389
You know what?
You don't know me, OK?

1271
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:04,521
You don't know shit about me!

1272
01:12:05,898 --> 01:12:07,559
Oh...

1273
01:12:07,600 --> 01:12:10,296
that's where
you're wrong, girl.

1274
01:12:10,336 --> 01:12:13,203
I know everything about you.

1275
01:12:13,239 --> 01:12:15,537
Yeah, I can see
right through you.

1276
01:12:15,575 --> 01:12:17,770
Everything to you
is a fuckin' game.

1277
01:12:17,810 --> 01:12:19,607
You ain't real.

1278
01:12:19,645 --> 01:12:20,942
That's not true.

1279
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:22,971
Oh, it's true.

1280
01:12:24,283 --> 01:12:25,875
You ain't real.

1281
01:12:25,918 --> 01:12:27,647
I'm real, right?

1282
01:12:27,687 --> 01:12:29,416
There ain't nothin' real
about you.

1283
01:12:29,455 --> 01:12:32,618
Your talk ain't real,
your walk ain't real...

1284
01:12:32,658 --> 01:12:34,626
the way you dress ain't real.

1285
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:36,560
You don't even copy 'em
from the real thing.

1286
01:12:36,596 --> 01:12:38,496
You fuckin' get it from the TV.

1287
01:12:38,531 --> 01:12:39,930
Hector.

1288
01:12:43,202 --> 01:12:44,794
Momentito.

1289
01:12:48,374 --> 01:12:49,534
What you thought?

1290
01:12:49,575 --> 01:12:51,236
You thought I was in love
with you or something?

1291
01:12:51,277 --> 01:12:52,437
Heh.

1292
01:12:52,478 --> 01:12:54,139
Is that what it is?

1293
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:55,807
Huh?

1294
01:12:55,848 --> 01:12:58,817
I don't know where you belong,
but it ain't here, girl.

1295
01:13:00,419 --> 01:13:01,818
Fine.

1296
01:13:10,363 --> 01:13:12,092
That's the guy.

1297
01:13:12,131 --> 01:13:13,723
That's definitely the guy. Yeah.

1298
01:13:13,766 --> 01:13:14,824
You sure?

1299
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:16,198
Yeah.

1300
01:13:16,235 --> 01:13:17,463
Do you know this guy?

1301
01:13:17,503 --> 01:13:19,767
Yes.

1302
01:13:19,805 --> 01:13:21,067
Excuse me.

1303
01:13:26,145 --> 01:13:27,669
Yo. Come on.

1304
01:13:27,713 --> 01:13:29,738
Come on. We got to talk.

1305
01:13:31,751 --> 01:13:34,083
You want to tell me
what happened to Emily?

1306
01:13:34,120 --> 01:13:35,849
What the fuck
were you guys doing...

1307
01:13:35,888 --> 01:13:39,016
in some hotel room in the slums
with another crew?

1308
01:13:39,058 --> 01:13:40,753
Shut up.

1309
01:13:40,793 --> 01:13:41,987
Alli, you fuckin' hear me?

1310
01:13:42,028 --> 01:13:44,326
I'm talkin' to you.
Talk to me! Come on!

1311
01:13:44,363 --> 01:13:45,887
Fuck o.

1312
01:13:45,931 --> 01:13:48,559
Yo, I ain't gonna let
this shit slide, Alli.

1313
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:50,068
You're out the P.L.C.!

1314
01:13:50,102 --> 01:13:52,798
Mr. Shapiro, we're here
to investigate a gang rape.

1315
01:13:52,838 --> 01:13:54,499
We just want to talk to her.

1316
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:56,701
Detective,
Allison knows nothing about it.

1317
01:13:56,742 --> 01:14:00,473
Her friend has been raped.
Allison was in the next room.

1318
01:14:00,513 --> 01:14:02,242
We just want cooperation...

1319
01:14:02,281 --> 01:14:04,841
in identifying the man
who violated her friend.

1320
01:14:04,884 --> 01:14:07,011
I can't believe you think
that Emily was raped...

1321
01:14:07,053 --> 01:14:08,486
and I hung out and watched.

1322
01:14:08,521 --> 01:14:10,011
Alli, let Robert handle this.

1323
01:14:10,056 --> 01:14:12,251
Detective, Alli can't be
of any use to you.

1324
01:14:12,291 --> 01:14:13,781
She didn't see anything.

1325
01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:16,852
She can't identify anyone.

1326
01:14:16,896 --> 01:14:18,227
This is insane.

1327
01:14:18,264 --> 01:14:20,255
I don't know anything
about a rape.

1328
01:14:32,745 --> 01:14:34,804
Hey.

1329
01:14:34,847 --> 01:14:36,041
Hey.

1330
01:14:38,451 --> 01:14:40,919
I'm not supposed
to talk to you.

1331
01:14:43,989 --> 01:14:45,513
Yeah?

1332
01:14:47,493 --> 01:14:49,393
Well, I mean,
it's just that what happened...

1333
01:14:49,428 --> 01:14:50,895
was almost, uh...

1334
01:14:50,930 --> 01:14:53,797
I mean, I think they took
advantage of me or something.

1335
01:14:53,833 --> 01:14:57,200
They, like, slipped me something.
Like, a roofie or something.

1336
01:14:58,437 --> 01:15:00,132
Yeah, maybe.

1337
01:15:04,143 --> 01:15:06,668
I wanted them to stop.

1338
01:15:12,384 --> 01:15:15,547
You were there.
You were my witness.

1339
01:15:15,588 --> 01:15:17,021
Mm-hmm.

1340
01:15:22,828 --> 01:15:25,558
I can't believe
I did that, Alli.

1341
01:15:27,933 --> 01:15:30,265
Oh, God. We both did it.

1342
01:15:30,302 --> 01:15:32,827
OK? We both did it.

1343
01:15:36,242 --> 01:15:37,937
I'm so sorry.

1344
01:15:47,553 --> 01:15:49,521
So, what now?

1345
01:15:53,626 --> 01:15:56,652
You've got to tell
the detectives what happened...

1346
01:15:56,695 --> 01:15:58,595
what they did to me.

1347
01:16:08,073 --> 01:16:09,335
Em?

1348
01:16:25,658 --> 01:16:28,821
Those little bitches are gonna
testify against Hector...

1349
01:16:28,861 --> 01:16:31,022
and put his ass away, homeboy.

1350
01:16:35,334 --> 01:16:37,598
What do you want to do, ese?

1351
01:16:38,771 --> 01:16:40,295
Go after them.

1352
01:16:40,339 --> 01:16:43,467
Hit 'em up, shut 'em up.

1353
01:16:43,509 --> 01:16:45,807
Órale. Vamos.

1354
01:16:54,753 --> 01:16:56,448
Sweetheart?

1355
01:16:56,488 --> 01:16:58,319
I owe you an apology.

1356
01:16:58,357 --> 01:17:00,917
We talked to the Rubins,
and they told us what happened.

1357
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,325
- They did?
- Yeah.

1358
01:17:03,329 --> 01:17:07,026
Ohh, thank God.
I told Emily yesterday.

1359
01:17:07,066 --> 01:17:09,034
I said th-th-that
I hoped that she would say...

1360
01:17:09,068 --> 01:17:10,592
Nobody blames you.

1361
01:17:10,636 --> 01:17:13,935
Emily got isolated in another room
where she got attacked.

1362
01:17:16,175 --> 01:17:17,267
What?

1363
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:18,901
You kids had been drinking.

1364
01:17:18,944 --> 01:17:20,878
They realize that
you didn't see anything.

1365
01:17:20,913 --> 01:17:22,471
They don't even need
your testimony.

1366
01:17:22,514 --> 01:17:24,243
We made sure of that.

1367
01:17:24,283 --> 01:17:26,478
They're gonna press charges?

1368
01:17:26,518 --> 01:17:29,885
Yes, of course, but you don't
need to be involved.

1369
01:17:29,922 --> 01:17:31,617
But...

1370
01:17:31,657 --> 01:17:34,524
but they... they didn't.

1371
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,187
We were the ones...

1372
01:17:37,529 --> 01:17:40,191
I know you're relieved, honey.
I know.

1373
01:17:40,232 --> 01:17:42,132
Let it all out.

1374
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:43,725
¿ Qué pasa, homes?

1375
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:47,268
Hey, yo, camera boy.

1376
01:17:47,306 --> 01:17:49,171
Say something, boy!
Say something!

1377
01:17:49,208 --> 01:17:50,266
Pussy.

1378
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:53,938
Hey, T. Hey, my pops
took out an alligator...

1379
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:56,379
with this gauge right here.
He was, like... boom!

1380
01:17:56,415 --> 01:17:59,248
For real, dawg.
This is some serious shit.

1381
01:17:59,285 --> 01:18:00,377
This is seriously illegal.

1382
01:18:00,419 --> 01:18:01,443
You're not gonna want
to be taking film...

1383
01:18:01,487 --> 01:18:03,011
Son, you better
turn that shit on.

1384
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:05,990
You hear me? Our life
is a fuckin' film, dawg.

1385
01:18:06,025 --> 01:18:08,619
We a fuckin' film.
You the fuckin' filmmaker.

1386
01:18:08,661 --> 01:18:10,492
We 'bout to mount up.
We 'bout to pay back.

1387
01:18:10,529 --> 01:18:12,656
That's why you with
the P.L.C., dawg.

1388
01:18:12,698 --> 01:18:16,259
Ain't no 16th Street punk
gonna be corrupting my goddess!

1389
01:18:16,302 --> 01:18:18,463
Yo, I would die for that girl.

1390
01:18:18,504 --> 01:18:20,995
And I will kill for her.
That's my word.

1391
01:18:23,108 --> 01:18:24,166
This is for you, girl!

1392
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:25,733
How do I look?
How do I look? Huh?

1393
01:18:25,778 --> 01:18:27,643
Huh? You gonna see me
comin' right at you!

1394
01:18:27,680 --> 01:18:29,238
Right up in
your fuckin' face, dawg!

1395
01:18:29,281 --> 01:18:30,407
That's right!

1396
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:31,711
That's right.
That's for real, dawg.

1397
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:32,774
That's real.

1398
01:19:04,650 --> 01:19:06,311
¿ Dónde vas, vato?

1399
01:19:06,352 --> 01:19:08,115
Ain't this Pacific Palisades?

1400
01:19:08,153 --> 01:19:10,280
Nah. Chale, homes.
This is Bel-Air.

1401
01:19:10,322 --> 01:19:12,119
Fuck! Turn around, turn around.

1402
01:19:12,157 --> 01:19:13,146
Keep it down.

1403
01:19:13,192 --> 01:19:14,523
Not in front of
the fuckin' police.

1404
01:19:14,560 --> 01:19:16,152
Hey, what the fuck
you want me to do?

1405
01:19:16,195 --> 01:19:17,856
Well, none of it really matters.

1406
01:19:17,896 --> 01:19:20,160
We're just teenagers,
and we're bored.

1407
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:22,064
We are totally...

1408
01:19:22,101 --> 01:19:26,003
fuckin'... bored.

1409
01:19:28,440 --> 01:19:30,067
I remember her.

1410
01:19:32,378 --> 01:19:34,243
I shot something
earlier today...

1411
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:37,874
that I would love for you
to watch, if you would. Um...

1412
01:19:45,991 --> 01:19:48,425
That's right! That's why
you rollin' with the P.L.C.!

1413
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:52,419
Ain't no 16th Street punks
gonna be corrupting my goddess!

1414
01:19:52,464 --> 01:19:54,455
Yo, I would die for that girl!

1415
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:57,765
And I will kill for her.
That's my word!

1416
01:19:57,803 --> 01:19:59,065
Yeah.

1417
01:19:59,104 --> 01:20:00,435
Don't get that shit
twisted, son.

1418
01:20:00,472 --> 01:20:01,905
That's shit's
fuckin' right, son!

1419
01:20:01,940 --> 01:20:03,703
It's fuckin' right, dawg.

1420
01:20:03,742 --> 01:20:04,970
Oh, God.

1421
01:20:11,884 --> 01:20:13,215
Yeah, what's up?

1422
01:20:13,252 --> 01:20:15,914
Toby, what are you thinking?

1423
01:20:15,954 --> 01:20:17,922
What the fuck
are you talkin' about, man?

1424
01:20:17,956 --> 01:20:19,890
The guns, Toby. What the...

1425
01:20:19,925 --> 01:20:21,187
Fuck you, bitch!

1426
01:20:21,226 --> 01:20:23,990
Don't fuckin' come at me,
telling me what to do!

1427
01:20:24,029 --> 01:20:26,054
Fuckin' bounced your ass
out the P.L.C.!

1428
01:20:26,098 --> 01:20:27,827
No, Toby!
Toby, listen to me, OK?

1429
01:20:27,866 --> 01:20:29,663
You don't know anything
about what happened, all right?

1430
01:20:29,701 --> 01:20:30,929
Emily wasn't raped.

1431
01:20:30,969 --> 01:20:32,732
Aw, fuck... You fuckin' liar.

1432
01:20:32,771 --> 01:20:36,070
You havin' fun goin' down on
your fuckin' 16th Street pole?

1433
01:20:36,108 --> 01:20:37,507
Bitch?

1434
01:20:37,543 --> 01:20:40,569
Fuck, Toby.
Just listen to me, please.

1435
01:20:40,612 --> 01:20:43,604
I'm gonna talk to you later.
I'm fuckin' busy.

1436
01:20:43,649 --> 01:20:46,447
Chicken-ass chicken heads.

1437
01:20:59,531 --> 01:21:01,726
Oh, shit, homes.
It's the jura.

1438
01:21:01,767 --> 01:21:03,496
¡Chinga!

1439
01:21:03,535 --> 01:21:05,230
So, why are you out here
in the first place?

1440
01:21:05,270 --> 01:21:06,965
Uh, we're just driving
to the beach.

1441
01:21:07,005 --> 01:21:08,029
The beach?

1442
01:21:08,073 --> 01:21:09,233
We're going home now.

1443
01:21:09,274 --> 01:21:11,003
- And where's home?
- East Los.

1444
01:21:11,043 --> 01:21:13,034
You know how
to get out of here?

1445
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:14,306
Chale, we're lost.

1446
01:21:14,346 --> 01:21:16,143
Homes, you got lost.

1447
01:21:16,181 --> 01:21:17,773
Well, we can help you out
with that.

1448
01:21:17,816 --> 01:21:20,614
I don't ever want to see you
in this neighborhood again.

1449
01:21:20,652 --> 01:21:23,621
- Órale.
- All right.

1450
01:21:23,655 --> 01:21:27,022
I just don't want
to see anybody right now.

1451
01:21:27,059 --> 01:21:29,027
So we go to Sun Valley
for a couple of weeks...

1452
01:21:29,061 --> 01:21:31,052
and we don't worry about it.

1453
01:21:31,096 --> 01:21:32,085
- Deal?
- OK.

1454
01:21:32,131 --> 01:21:33,155
Em?

1455
01:21:35,834 --> 01:21:37,859
Oh... Alli...

1456
01:21:37,903 --> 01:21:39,871
you've always been a friend
in our house...

1457
01:21:39,905 --> 01:21:40,997
Mom.

1458
01:21:41,039 --> 01:21:42,336
It's not that
we don't love you...

1459
01:21:42,374 --> 01:21:44,774
but I think we all need
a little break.

1460
01:21:47,579 --> 01:21:49,672
You didn't tell them
about the dice?

1461
01:21:49,715 --> 01:21:51,478
Alli, don't.

1462
01:21:51,517 --> 01:21:54,384
Emily... Toby, Nick, and Sam
are going downtown right now...

1463
01:21:54,419 --> 01:21:57,911
for revenge,
to defend your honor.

1464
01:21:57,956 --> 01:21:59,446
We asked...

1465
01:21:59,491 --> 01:22:03,257
I asked if we could...

1466
01:22:03,295 --> 01:22:06,093
if we could be in those guys
from East L.A.'s crew.

1467
01:22:06,131 --> 01:22:07,291
- If we could...
- Shut up.

1468
01:22:07,332 --> 01:22:10,062
No, no, no. What...
You did what?

1469
01:22:10,102 --> 01:22:13,833
The way to do that
was by rolling dice.

1470
01:22:13,872 --> 01:22:15,931
Then you, um...

1471
01:22:17,676 --> 01:22:19,735
you sleep with
whatever number comes up.

1472
01:22:19,778 --> 01:22:21,575
Oh, no.

1473
01:22:21,613 --> 01:22:23,240
Do what?

1474
01:22:23,282 --> 01:22:24,715
Dad...

1475
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:26,615
It's their initiation thing.

1476
01:22:26,652 --> 01:22:30,019
We asked for it.
We asked if we could join...

1477
01:22:30,055 --> 01:22:32,023
and then we went
into the other room with them...

1478
01:22:32,057 --> 01:22:33,388
on our own.

1479
01:22:34,927 --> 01:22:36,724
It was our decision.

1480
01:22:36,762 --> 01:22:40,425
I hate you! I can never be
your friend again!

1481
01:23:04,756 --> 01:23:06,951
Em?

1482
01:23:06,992 --> 01:23:08,892
Come on. Em?

1483
01:23:08,927 --> 01:23:10,224
Em?

1484
01:23:10,262 --> 01:23:12,594
Why don't you just fuck o?

1485
01:23:15,133 --> 01:23:17,101
Come on. Don't be like that.

1486
01:23:17,135 --> 01:23:19,160
Why not, Alli?

1487
01:23:19,204 --> 01:23:21,138
What, do you want
to spend the night again?

1488
01:23:21,173 --> 01:23:22,936
Do you want to go on vacation...

1489
01:23:22,975 --> 01:23:25,500
with me and my parents?
Is that what it is?

1490
01:23:30,249 --> 01:23:31,841
I'm sorry.

1491
01:23:33,185 --> 01:23:36,814
The one fucking time
I really, really needed you...

1492
01:23:36,855 --> 01:23:38,584
and you didn't have my back.

1493
01:23:40,959 --> 01:23:42,256
What...

1494
01:23:42,294 --> 01:23:46,663
No. Em, come on.
It's not like that.

1495
01:23:46,698 --> 01:23:47,960
No, that's exactly
what it's like.

1496
01:23:48,967 --> 01:23:50,195
Get the fuck on the ground!

1497
01:23:50,235 --> 01:23:51,759
Get on the fucking ground!

1498
01:23:51,803 --> 01:23:52,963
Aah!

1499
01:23:53,005 --> 01:23:54,199
Get the fuck on the ground!

1500
01:23:54,239 --> 01:23:55,365
Where is everybody?!

1501
01:23:55,407 --> 01:23:56,897
Sammy, check the other rooms!

1502
01:23:56,942 --> 01:23:58,671
Shut the fuck up!

1503
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:01,372
Where the fuck is everybody?!

1504
01:24:01,413 --> 01:24:02,471
Shut the fuck up!

1505
01:24:03,915 --> 01:24:05,712
What's she saying?

1506
01:24:06,685 --> 01:24:09,677
I swear to fucking God!
What the fuck's she saying?!

1507
01:24:09,721 --> 01:24:11,052
She said,
"Please don't hurt my baby."

1508
01:24:11,089 --> 01:24:12,351
Are you fuckin' serious?!

1509
01:24:12,391 --> 01:24:14,291
"Please don't hurt my baby."

1510
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:17,357
Fuck!

1511
01:24:19,231 --> 01:24:21,961
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

1512
01:24:24,870 --> 01:24:25,859
What the fuck...

1513
01:24:25,904 --> 01:24:27,394
Sammy! Yo, come on!

1514
01:24:27,439 --> 01:24:29,407
Sammy, get the fuck in the car!

1515
01:24:29,441 --> 01:24:31,568
Fuck!

1516
01:24:31,610 --> 01:24:33,737
Come on! Get the fuck over here!

1517
01:24:39,217 --> 01:24:40,946
Ah!

1518
01:24:41,953 --> 01:24:43,750
Are you using a razor?

1519
01:24:43,789 --> 01:24:44,778
Ah!

1520
01:24:44,823 --> 01:24:46,051
You know, razors really hurt.

1521
01:24:46,091 --> 01:24:47,718
And you're gonna have to
cover up your wrists...

1522
01:24:47,759 --> 01:24:48,885
for, like, a week.

1523
01:24:50,729 --> 01:24:52,253
Emily?

1524
01:24:52,297 --> 01:24:54,265
Emily, do you have a gun?

1525
01:24:54,299 --> 01:24:55,994
No.

1526
01:24:56,034 --> 01:24:58,093
It's OK. I'm taking a bath.

1527
01:24:58,136 --> 01:25:01,230
Well, you could try
taking sleeping pills...

1528
01:25:01,273 --> 01:25:02,865
but you don't have enough
to kill yourself...

1529
01:25:02,908 --> 01:25:04,535
so you're just gonna be
in the hospital...

1530
01:25:04,576 --> 01:25:06,806
in about an hour,
getting your stomach pumped.

1531
01:25:10,048 --> 01:25:13,848
Ohh, I can run home and get you
this nylon slip noose I made.

1532
01:25:13,885 --> 01:25:17,082
When you strangle yourself,
your jugular pops out...

1533
01:25:17,122 --> 01:25:19,613
and you can slice it
with a sharp knife.

1534
01:25:19,658 --> 01:25:20,784
That's great.

1535
01:25:20,826 --> 01:25:22,384
OK, that sucks.

1536
01:25:24,062 --> 01:25:27,793
I'm sure your mom's got an extra
suicide kit stashed somewhere.

1537
01:25:29,534 --> 01:25:31,399
Um...

1538
01:25:31,436 --> 01:25:33,836
yeah, I think she, uh...

1539
01:25:33,872 --> 01:25:38,104
Heh. I think she keeps it
in a fucking... pot. Heh.

1540
01:25:44,916 --> 01:25:46,315
Hey.

1541
01:25:48,453 --> 01:25:49,818
Let me in?

1542
01:25:52,023 --> 01:25:53,650
I'm OK.

1543
01:25:57,896 --> 01:25:59,796
I'm not leaving.

1544
01:26:12,911 --> 01:26:14,640
So... what's, uh...

1545
01:26:14,679 --> 01:26:17,375
what's everybody doing tomorrow?

1546
01:27:16,107 --> 01:27:18,132
Hey. ¿ Qué quieres, cabron?

1547
01:27:18,176 --> 01:27:19,370
What's up, white boy?

1548
01:27:19,411 --> 01:27:20,810
Damn. Just go. Just go.

1549
01:27:20,846 --> 01:27:22,074
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Go! Go!

1550
01:27:25,317 --> 01:27:28,480
I don't know. Shit.

1551
01:27:28,520 --> 01:27:31,421
I mean, I'm a... kid,
basically...

1552
01:27:31,456 --> 01:27:34,289
with good S.A.T. Scores.

1553
01:27:34,326 --> 01:27:37,625
But you can waste a lot of time
buying into stu like that...

1554
01:27:37,662 --> 01:27:39,630
crying over some shit
you think's important...

1555
01:27:39,664 --> 01:27:42,030
for, like, two seconds.

1556
01:27:43,969 --> 01:27:47,370
I mean, if you give us
a moment of... connection...

1557
01:27:47,405 --> 01:27:50,431
one true moment...

1558
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:52,466
and it's, like, suddenly...

1559
01:27:52,511 --> 01:27:56,709
we know everything in the world.

1560
01:27:56,748 --> 01:27:58,682
And that's us.

1561
01:27:59,951 --> 01:28:02,283
That's all there is to us.

1562
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,117
So, um...

1563
01:28:05,423 --> 01:28:07,288
is that a wrap?

1564
01:28:10,562 --> 01:28:11,790
That's it.

1565
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:18,790
