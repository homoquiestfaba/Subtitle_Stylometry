1
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,934
Much more than just a series
of small, isolated incidents...

2
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:25,564
it's apparent an organized
criminal element is at work.

3
00:00:25,742 --> 00:00:28,006
And at the moment,
business is good.

4
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:32,171
o good, in fact, there appear
to be no eyewitnesses...

5
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:33,747
to any of these crimes.

6
00:00:33,917 --> 00:00:36,249
With complaints ranging
from purse-snatching...

7
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:37,750
to breaking and entering...

8
00:00:37,921 --> 00:00:39,752
police switchboards have been
swamped...

9
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:42,756
with the angry voices
of more and more citizens...

10
00:00:42,926 --> 00:00:46,054
who have fallen prey
to the recent surge of crime...

11
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,060
that continues
to plague the city.

12
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:08,176
Instead of getting better,
things have gotten worse.

13
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:09,648
Even more alarming
is the baffling...

14
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:13,949
and often bizarre
nature of these crimes.

15
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,657
Merchandise of every size
and description...

16
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,159
from skateboards
to stereo systems...

17
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,560
has been disappearing
from store shelves...

18
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,758
and storage areas
at an alarming rate.

19
00:01:29,305 --> 00:01:33,207
Even the victims themselves
rarely glimpse the thieves.

20
00:01:33,376 --> 00:01:37,073
Many don't know they've been
victimized until it's too late.

21
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:42,412
In fact, police have yet
to come up with an eyewitness.

22
00:01:42,585 --> 00:01:44,416
Only a few vague reports...

23
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:48,921
of young boys or teenagers
at the scenes have been filed.

24
00:01:49,092 --> 00:01:52,926
But whoever is behind these
crimes, one thing is certain.

25
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:58,625
These are much more than just
a series of random incidents.

26
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,600
Come on. Hurry up.

27
00:02:15,185 --> 00:02:16,550
Good.

28
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,651
Crimes without criminals?

29
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:26,489
An invisible gang at work?

30
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,153
Who are we going to call?

31
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:31,562
Unfortunately, the police
are the only ones available...

32
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:36,194
to combat what some are dubbing
"the silent crime wave."

33
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:38,966
But perhaps the most
disturbing silence...

34
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:41,474
is that coming from City Hall.

35
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:45,102
April O'Neil,
Channel Three Eyewitness News.

36
00:02:45,281 --> 00:02:47,044
You got to stop working so hard.

37
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:50,050
What, give up all this glamour?

38
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:53,018
Good night.

39
00:03:29,726 --> 00:03:31,216
Bad timing.

40
00:03:32,362 --> 00:03:33,420
You're telling me.

41
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:35,928
Get her purse.

42
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,227
Get away from me!
What do you think... Help!

43
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:41,700
- Get her jewelry.
- I got her watch!

44
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:02,691
What the hell's going on?
Thought I'd seen it all.

45
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:08,488
All right. Come on, tough guys.

46
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:13,224
You all right, ma'am?

47
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,893
I'm fine.

48
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:18,063
Rest right here
while we deal with these guys.

49
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,905
Ted, give John a hand.

50
00:04:27,083 --> 00:04:29,415
Oh, man.

51
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,722
Let's get them in the car.

52
00:04:34,891 --> 00:04:35,949
Damn.

53
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:04,810
Oh, spectacular.

54
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:06,319
We were awesome, bros.

55
00:05:06,489 --> 00:05:07,751
Awesome!

56
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:09,118
Yes, dudes and dude-ettes...

57
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,386
major league butt-kicking
is back in town.

58
00:05:17,767 --> 00:05:19,496
Awesome!

59
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:21,834
Righteous!

60
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:25,031
- Bossa nova!
- What?

61
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,800
Bossa nova?

62
00:05:26,976 --> 00:05:28,910
Chevy Nova?

63
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:33,473
Excellent!

64
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,476
All right!

65
00:05:36,652 --> 00:05:38,483
Come on, let's move it.

66
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:39,985
I'm starving.

67
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:41,145
We're talking...

68
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:42,313
major pizza attack here, dudes.

69
00:05:42,492 --> 00:05:45,825
Pizza! I need it. Oh, baby.

70
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,929
Oh, man!

71
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,531
What's eating him, bros?

72
00:05:52,702 --> 00:05:54,033
Give me three.

73
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:55,693
You got it.

74
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,142
We were great.

75
00:06:03,413 --> 00:06:04,778
Damn!

76
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:14,353
We have had our first battle...

77
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:16,719
Master plinter.

78
00:06:16,893 --> 00:06:20,624
They were many, but we kicked...

79
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,788
We fought well.

80
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,798
Were you seen?

81
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:30,098
In this you must never lapse.

82
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:32,104
Even those who would be...

83
00:06:32,275 --> 00:06:35,836
our allies would not understand.

84
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:39,504
Our domain is the shadow.

85
00:06:39,682 --> 00:06:41,741
tray from it reluctantly.

86
00:06:41,918 --> 00:06:44,250
For when you do, you must...

87
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,253
strike hard and fade away...

88
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,157
Without a trace.

89
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,792
I lost a sai.

90
00:06:53,963 --> 00:06:55,430
Then it is gone.

91
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:56,530
But I can get it back.

92
00:06:56,699 --> 00:06:59,532
Raphael... let it go.

93
00:07:05,808 --> 00:07:09,869
Your ninja skills
are reaching their peak.

94
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:16,884
Only one truly important lesson
remains, but must wait.

95
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:21,786
I know it is hard
for you here underground.

96
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,825
I want a large thick crust
with double cheese...

97
00:07:24,994 --> 00:07:26,120
ham, pepperoni...

98
00:07:26,295 --> 00:07:30,129
Your teenage minds
are broad, eager.

99
00:07:30,299 --> 00:07:34,861
But you must never stop
practicing the art of ninja...

100
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:38,598
the art of invisibility.

101
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:40,765
Oh, but no anchovies.

102
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:42,706
And I mean no anchovies.

103
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:46,747
You put anchovies on this thing,
and you're in big trouble.

104
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:47,940
Michaelangelo!

105
00:07:48,117 --> 00:07:50,642
That'll do.
And the clock's ticking, dude.

106
00:07:54,524 --> 00:07:57,288
You are still young...

107
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,624
but one day, I will be gone.

108
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:05,665
Use my teachings wisely.

109
00:08:05,835 --> 00:08:12,399
I suggest we all meditate now
on the events of this evening.

110
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,250
Ninjitsu!

111
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:35,522
Well, this is like meditating.

112
00:08:36,966 --> 00:08:39,264
Hey, Raph, where you going?

113
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,335
Out to a movie.

114
00:08:43,005 --> 00:08:44,472
That OK with you?

115
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:54,449
ock it to me, baby.

116
00:09:13,202 --> 00:09:14,533
How you doing?

117
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:15,762
Fine.

118
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,701
Nice night.

119
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:24,343
Pizza dude's got 30 seconds.

120
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:31,210
Mikey, did you ever think about
what plinter said tonight?

121
00:09:31,387 --> 00:09:37,383
I mean, about what it would
be like not having him?

122
00:09:39,862 --> 00:09:42,660
Time's up. Three bucks off.

123
00:09:56,078 --> 00:10:00,708
Now, 122... 122 1/8?

124
00:10:00,883 --> 00:10:03,909
One-twenty-two and an eigth?

125
00:10:04,086 --> 00:10:08,250
Terrific.
Where the heck is 122 1 /8?

126
00:10:08,424 --> 00:10:11,450
You're standing on it, dude.

127
00:10:11,627 --> 00:10:13,686
Just slip it down here.

128
00:10:20,002 --> 00:10:22,470
Give me that!

129
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:28,575
This is a 10. The tab's 13.

130
00:10:28,744 --> 00:10:30,075
You're two minutes late, dude.

131
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:33,113
Come on!
I couldn't find the place!

132
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:35,443
Wise man say,
"Forgiveness is divine...

133
00:10:35,618 --> 00:10:38,451
"but never pay full price
for late pizza."

134
00:10:38,621 --> 00:10:41,715
I got to get a new route.

135
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,483
And I thought
I delivered everywhere.

136
00:10:43,659 --> 00:10:47,060
Yes, friends,
the new Turbo Ginsu!

137
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,924
It dices, it slices...

138
00:10:49,098 --> 00:10:52,158
and yet makes french fries
in 30 different...

139
00:10:53,836 --> 00:10:55,861
Kids.

140
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,744
Where do they come up
with this stuff?

141
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:25,299
omebody stop them!

142
00:11:43,486 --> 00:11:46,114
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know.

143
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:50,725
That was a crime,
you purse-grabbing pukes...

144
00:11:50,893 --> 00:11:52,724
and this is the penalty.

145
00:11:54,363 --> 00:11:56,695
Two minutes for slashing,
two minutes for hooking...

146
00:11:56,866 --> 00:12:00,199
and let's not forget
my personal favorite...

147
00:12:00,369 --> 00:12:02,803
two minutes for high-sticking.

148
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,674
How about a five-minute game
misconduct for roughing, pal?

149
00:12:07,843 --> 00:12:09,333
Hey, Bogey...

150
00:12:09,512 --> 00:12:10,945
who died and made you referee?

151
00:12:11,113 --> 00:12:12,910
You did your job. Get out
of here and let me do mine.

152
00:12:13,082 --> 00:12:14,674
These JV lowlifes need
to be taught a lesson.

153
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,047
Not like that they don't.
Not from you.

154
00:12:21,056 --> 00:12:25,550
It looks like you're
the one who needs a lesson, pal.

155
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:29,664
Class is Pain 101.
Your instructor is Casey Jones.

156
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,357
I don't want to fight you.

157
00:12:32,535 --> 00:12:34,332
Tough rocks, pal.

158
00:12:37,106 --> 00:12:39,131
A Jose Canseco bat?

159
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:41,936
Tell me... you didn't
pay money for this.

160
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:44,545
That's it.

161
00:12:44,713 --> 00:12:47,045
Was a two-for-one sale, pal.

162
00:12:48,451 --> 00:12:51,215
Hey, what are you,
some sort of punker?

163
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:55,146
I hate punkers.

164
00:12:55,324 --> 00:12:57,758
Especially bald ones
with green makeup...

165
00:12:57,927 --> 00:13:00,418
who wear masks over ugly faces.

166
00:13:00,596 --> 00:13:01,654
That's it.

167
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:05,531
New batter! Trike one!

168
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:07,430
Whiffer.

169
00:13:10,773 --> 00:13:12,263
Home run.

170
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,533
Raphael wins!

171
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,373
One-nothing!

172
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,177
Well?

173
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:24,910
New game, roundhead.

174
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,515
Cricket.

175
00:13:28,691 --> 00:13:32,320
Cricket?
Nobody understands cricket.

176
00:13:32,495 --> 00:13:35,089
You got to know what a crumpet
is to understand cricket.

177
00:13:35,264 --> 00:13:37,357
I'll teach you.

178
00:13:42,004 --> 00:13:43,164
ix runs.

179
00:13:48,811 --> 00:13:51,211
o long, freak.
I got work to do.

180
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,745
Freak?!

181
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,858
What the heck was that?

182
00:14:04,026 --> 00:14:07,860
Looked like a big turtle
in a trench coat.

183
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,123
You going to La Guardia?

184
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,767
Come back here!
I'm not finished with you!

185
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,529
Damn!

186
00:14:30,152 --> 00:14:31,813
Come sit by me.

187
00:14:31,987 --> 00:14:33,978
Couldn't this wait till morning?

188
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:36,317
You will listen now.

189
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:50,667
My master Yoshi's
first rule was...

190
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:54,671
Possess the right thinking.

191
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:58,244
Only then can one receive...

192
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:02,976
the gifts of strength,
knowledge, and peace.

193
00:15:06,789 --> 00:15:11,021
I have tried to channel
your anger, Raphael...

194
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:13,320
but more remains.

195
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:17,261
Anger clouds the mind.

196
00:15:17,433 --> 00:15:22,302
Turned inward,
it is an unconquerable enemy.

197
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:26,930
You are unique
among your brothers...

198
00:15:27,109 --> 00:15:31,944
for you choose
to face this enemy alone.

199
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:37,814
But as you face it,
do not forget them.

200
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:41,650
And do not forget me.

201
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:48,594
I am here, my son.

202
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:49,798
April, you could've called me
last night, you know?

203
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:52,995
April, you could've called me
last night, you know?

204
00:15:53,168 --> 00:15:54,965
Call it a quirk,
but I like to know...

205
00:15:55,137 --> 00:15:57,367
when one of my best reporters
has been mugged.

206
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:58,801
I wasn't mugged, Charles.

207
00:15:58,974 --> 00:16:00,805
Besides,
I knew you'd just worry...

208
00:16:00,976 --> 00:16:04,139
and rush over here
like you did this morning.

209
00:16:04,313 --> 00:16:06,474
From now on,
ecurity is gonna escort you...

210
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:08,810
to that stone-age van of yours
every night.

211
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:11,578
- Yes, sir.
- I'm not kidding, April.

212
00:16:11,754 --> 00:16:13,949
Hey, Danny, how's school going?

213
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:16,148
- Fine.
- Wonderful.

214
00:16:16,325 --> 00:16:20,159
o wonderful I have to drive
him there every morning now...

215
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:21,626
just to make sure he goes.

216
00:16:23,966 --> 00:16:27,060
That's what he does
when he wants to ignore me...

217
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,704
sticks his head in those things.

218
00:16:29,872 --> 00:16:33,364
I wonder where the hell
he got those things, anyway.

219
00:16:33,542 --> 00:16:35,339
Charles, give the kid a break.

220
00:16:36,812 --> 00:16:40,646
Just what is going on
out there, April?

221
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:43,546
I've never seen anything
like this before.

222
00:16:43,719 --> 00:16:45,516
It's like
the city's falling apart.

223
00:16:45,688 --> 00:16:48,885
It's getting so you can't step
outside in the daytime anymore.

224
00:16:49,058 --> 00:16:50,821
I'll tell you one thing.

225
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:53,826
After everything I've been
hearing out of Little Tokyo...

226
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,328
terns is gonna have some
answering to do this afternoon.

227
00:16:56,498 --> 00:16:59,058
Just take it easy.

228
00:16:59,234 --> 00:17:02,294
He's already got the mayor
breathing down my neck.

229
00:17:02,471 --> 00:17:05,372
We are presently executing
a plan of redeployment...

230
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,372
that will minimize
response time...

231
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:10,706
while maximizing coordination
between patrol units...

232
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,871
in a decentralized
networking scheme.

233
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:19,786
I'm not sure I understood
all that, Chief terns.

234
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,857
Would you mind repeating it...
in English, perhaps?

235
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:29,328
What that means, Miss O'Neil,
is everything is well in hand.

236
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:32,661
Hey, guys, look. That's her.

237
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:35,167
I didn't say that either,
Miss O'Neil.

238
00:17:35,337 --> 00:17:37,828
If you would stick
to asking questions...

239
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,302
I'm in love.

240
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,342
What do you know
about an organization...

241
00:17:43,512 --> 00:17:44,843
known as The Foot Clan?

242
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,915
There is no evidence to link
such a name to these incidents.

243
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:52,918
Are you denying an organization
known as The Foot exists?

244
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:54,988
I'm not denying anything.

245
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,887
You're putting words
into my mouth.

246
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:01,791
Find her.

247
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,057
ilence her.

248
00:18:04,233 --> 00:18:07,202
- He's great.
- An understatement as usual.

249
00:18:07,369 --> 00:18:10,031
You're telling me.
The girl is a fox.

250
00:18:10,205 --> 00:18:11,763
Take a look at the local
weather for this vicinity...

251
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,066
as it stands at this hour.

252
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:15,802
O'Neil, get in here.

253
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:18,945
Time me.

254
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:28,385
Just what is it you
hoped to accomplish out there...

255
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:29,888
besides busting my chops?

256
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:34,620
I think you know as much
as I do about this Foot Clan...

257
00:18:34,797 --> 00:18:37,027
and I don't think you're
doing anything about it.

258
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,996
You expect me to waste
precious manpower...

259
00:18:39,168 --> 00:18:41,363
because a few immigrants
are reminded of something...

260
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,563
that supposedly happened
years ago in Japan?

261
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,071
Have you got something else?

262
00:18:46,241 --> 00:18:50,337
Are you trying to tell me
how to do my job?

263
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,781
One minute, seven seconds...
a new record.

264
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:19,501
Oh... great. Just great.

265
00:19:30,485 --> 00:19:32,885
We've been waiting for you,
Miss O'Neil.

266
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:37,389
Am I behind
on my ony payments again?

267
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,893
Your mouth may yet bring you
much trouble, Miss O'Neil.

268
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,760
I deliver a message.

269
00:19:47,202 --> 00:19:48,396
hut it.

270
00:19:53,642 --> 00:19:56,270
All right. That's it!

271
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:57,339
Are you crazy?

272
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,330
Are you crazy?

273
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,936
Yeah, Leo, I'm crazy!

274
00:21:03,111 --> 00:21:04,703
A loony!

275
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,972
Why?

276
00:21:06,148 --> 00:21:08,480
Why? Oh, I don't know.

277
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:10,447
'Cause I wanted to redecorate.

278
00:21:10,619 --> 00:21:13,679
A couple of throw pillows,
a TV news reporter.

279
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,482
What do you think?

280
00:21:15,657 --> 00:21:17,488
Raphael, what are you doing?

281
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:19,627
he got jumped in the subway.

282
00:21:19,795 --> 00:21:22,855
- I had to bring her here.
- It's the news lady.

283
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,090
Can we keep her?

284
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:28,301
Bring water,
cold washcloth, pillow.

285
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,869
Far out!

286
00:21:54,763 --> 00:21:56,060
Oh, my God!

287
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,495
I'm dead! I'm dead, aren't I?

288
00:21:58,667 --> 00:22:00,498
- It's OK.
- No, I'm dreaming.

289
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:01,829
I must be dreaming.

290
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:05,599
Those guys in the black pajamas,
they jumped me.

291
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:08,504
And that rat... I saw you
in the parking lot.

292
00:22:08,677 --> 00:22:11,874
That explains you.
And you guys...

293
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:17,678
I have no idea
where you came from.

294
00:22:17,853 --> 00:22:21,619
If you will please just sit down
and calm yourself...

295
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,554
I will tell you
where we came from.

296
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:26,125
It talks!

297
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,489
It is really quite simple,
Miss O'Neil.

298
00:22:28,663 --> 00:22:33,362
And he knows my name. Perfect.

299
00:22:33,535 --> 00:22:35,662
Fifteen years ago...

300
00:22:35,837 --> 00:22:38,829
Why don't I ever dream of
Harrison Ford?

301
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:46,337
For 15 years now,
we have lived here.

302
00:22:46,515 --> 00:22:53,011
Before that time, I was a pet
of my master Yoshi...

303
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:56,919
mimicking his movements
from my cage...

304
00:22:57,092 --> 00:23:00,391
and learning
the secret art of ninja.

305
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:05,922
When we were forced to come
to New York...

306
00:23:06,101 --> 00:23:09,730
I found myself for the first
time without a home...

307
00:23:09,905 --> 00:23:16,435
wandering the sewers, scavenging
for whatever I could find.

308
00:23:16,611 --> 00:23:18,806
And then, one day...

309
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,778
I came upon
a shattered glass jar...

310
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:24,248
and four baby turtles.

311
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:25,943
That was us.

312
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,816
hut up.

313
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:34,261
The little ones were crawling
into a strange glowing ooze...

314
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:37,592
from a broken canister nearby.

315
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,965
I gathered them up
in an old coffee can...

316
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,970
and when
I awoke the next morning...

317
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:50,305
I received a shock,
for they had doubled in size.

318
00:23:50,479 --> 00:23:54,108
l, too, was growing,
particularly in intellect...

319
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:57,718
and I was amazed at how
intelligent they seemed.

320
00:23:57,886 --> 00:24:02,619
But nothing could have prepared
me for what happened next.

321
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,622
One of them spoke.

322
00:24:04,793 --> 00:24:07,353
Pizza! Pizza!

323
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,431
More words followed,
and I began their training...

324
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,434
teaching them all that
I had learned from my master.

325
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:17,572
Radical! Radical! Radical!

326
00:24:17,739 --> 00:24:21,231
And soon
I gave them all names...

327
00:24:21,409 --> 00:24:23,434
Leonardo...

328
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,773
- Michaelangelo...
- That's me.

329
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:28,381
Donatello...

330
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,245
and Raphael.

331
00:24:34,256 --> 00:24:37,487
I'm not dreaming, am I?

332
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:40,127
I'm afraid not.

333
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,433
Are you guys sure you
know where you're going?

334
00:24:48,603 --> 00:24:50,935
1 1th and Bleecker?

335
00:24:51,106 --> 00:24:52,937
Nope. This is only 9th street.

336
00:24:53,108 --> 00:24:55,099
- Get it?
- Yuck.

337
00:25:09,691 --> 00:25:12,091
I'd like
to invite you all in...

338
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:17,630
but I don't have anything to
offer you except frozen pizza.

339
00:25:17,799 --> 00:25:20,097
Let's go for it!

340
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:22,759
You said the magic word.

341
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:26,101
- You guys eat pizza?
- Doesn't everybody?

342
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:29,869
Well, all right...

343
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:32,377
Did she say pizza?

344
00:25:32,547 --> 00:25:34,845
o, you live
in an antique store?

345
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,348
- Yep. Pizza!
- Well, above, actually.

346
00:25:37,519 --> 00:25:41,182
What do you guys
like on your pizza?

347
00:25:41,356 --> 00:25:45,759
Just the regular stuff...
flies, stink bugs.

348
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:48,418
It was a joke.

349
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,638
Maybe I'll fight Apollo,
and maybe I won't, you know?

350
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,538
What do you think? Adrian!

351
00:26:02,711 --> 00:26:04,838
Hey, I got another one!

352
00:26:05,013 --> 00:26:08,540
- This is totally cool!
- Oh, no, not Cagney.

353
00:26:08,717 --> 00:26:13,620
You dirty rat.
You killed my brother.

354
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,278
You dirty rat.

355
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,385
That must be
plinter's favorite.

356
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:29,167
It was a joke.

357
00:26:36,911 --> 00:26:40,711
And speaking of which,
we better get going.

358
00:26:40,882 --> 00:26:43,146
He worries.

359
00:26:43,318 --> 00:26:46,048
I don't know what to say.

360
00:26:46,221 --> 00:26:48,451
Will I ever see you guys again?

361
00:26:48,623 --> 00:26:49,647
Indubitably.

362
00:26:49,824 --> 00:26:52,657
That depends on how fast
you stock your pizza.

363
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,658
ee you around.

364
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:56,854
- Bye.
- Later.

365
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:02,904
[Skipped item nr. 365]

366
00:27:02,904 --> 00:27:05,668
No doubt about it.
he loved us!

367
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,307
It was the impressions.

368
00:27:07,475 --> 00:27:09,136
- You wish.
- Hold it.

369
00:27:54,989 --> 00:27:56,320
What's wrong?

370
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,779
Charles Pennington?

371
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,916
Yeah. Who's this?

372
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,517
You got a son
named Danny, Charles?

373
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,301
Who is it?

374
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,802
It's me, Charles.

375
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,771
It's my boss.

376
00:28:47,942 --> 00:28:50,103
Can you guys...

377
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:51,336
hide?

378
00:28:56,518 --> 00:28:58,179
Charles, what's up?

379
00:28:58,353 --> 00:29:00,685
April... listen.

380
00:29:02,524 --> 00:29:06,961
You have been working
awful hard on this story lately.

381
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:09,358
Why don't you take it easy
for a while?

382
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,291
Just let somebody else
handle it.

383
00:29:15,537 --> 00:29:18,370
Just for a little while,
you know?

384
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,906
What are you talking about?
It's my story. No way.

385
00:29:21,075 --> 00:29:22,440
Look at you. You're exhausted.

386
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,578
I just had a rough night.

387
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:27,442
Let somebody else
help you cover City Hall.

388
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:31,016
Charles, that's ridiculous.
What's with you today?

389
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,517
Nothing's with me today.

390
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,020
I just thought you might like
a little help.

391
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:39,991
I don't.
Hand me a towel, will you?

392
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:41,856
Where do you keep the towels?

393
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,862
What's wrong?

394
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,867
I just don't want you to see
my unsightly bathtub ring.

395
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,868
Out, out, out, out.

396
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,870
I have to get ready for work.

397
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,532
Are you sure you won't
reconsider about some help?

398
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,042
Danny, will you tell
your father to relax?

399
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,510
I wish.

400
00:30:01,182 --> 00:30:04,174
Just don't push
any buttons today.

401
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:09,255
That was close.

402
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:13,656
Time to switch to decaf, April.

403
00:30:13,828 --> 00:30:15,125
I don't get it, Danny.

404
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:18,288
I make more than enough money
to provide for both of us...

405
00:30:18,466 --> 00:30:20,627
and you're stealing. Why?

406
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:22,929
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

407
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:26,005
What the heck were you doing
with a car stereo anyway?

408
00:30:26,174 --> 00:30:27,573
Or don't you know that either?

409
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:28,902
- Orry.
- Orry?

410
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,103
Not as sorry as you're
going to be after school.

411
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:37,214
Danny, come back here!

412
00:31:17,425 --> 00:31:21,259
Check it out, man.
Anything you guys want, we got.

413
00:31:21,429 --> 00:31:24,330
Anything you want to do... do it.

414
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:26,330
Know what I'm saying? Anything.

415
00:31:26,501 --> 00:31:28,264
You got any cigarettes?

416
00:31:30,038 --> 00:31:32,268
Regular or menthol?

417
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,917
Read 'em and weep, boys.
Full house!

418
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:54,591
Go. Play.

419
00:32:11,913 --> 00:32:13,005
You.

420
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:30,755
Good.

421
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:41,768
Never lower your eyes
to an enemy.

422
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:43,774
Yes, Master Tatsu.

423
00:33:58,686 --> 00:34:00,381
Master hredder.

424
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:47,862
Money cannot buy the honor
which you have earned tonight.

425
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:56,108
You make us all proud.

426
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:03,610
Only effort,
discipline, loyalty...

427
00:35:03,785 --> 00:35:07,414
earn the right to wear
the Dragon dogi.

428
00:35:07,588 --> 00:35:12,491
You are here because
the outside world rejects you.

429
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:14,958
This is your family.

430
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:18,758
I am your father.

431
00:35:18,933 --> 00:35:25,634
I want you all to become
full members of The Foot.

432
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:28,605
There is a new enemy...

433
00:35:28,776 --> 00:35:33,440
freaks of nature
who interfere with our business.

434
00:35:33,614 --> 00:35:37,015
You are my eyes and ears.
Find them.

435
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:42,020
Together we will punish these...

436
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,125
creatures!

437
00:35:45,293 --> 00:35:49,662
These... turtles!

438
00:35:49,831 --> 00:35:51,628
Master.

439
00:36:03,778 --> 00:36:06,076
This is beginning
to sound less and less...

440
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,010
like your common,
garden-variety subway mugging.

441
00:36:08,182 --> 00:36:11,413
he's a good reporter.

442
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,611
he's a babe!

443
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:15,346
...known as The Foot.

444
00:36:15,523 --> 00:36:17,491
I'm sorry... The Foot?

445
00:36:17,658 --> 00:36:21,116
I know it sounds like a funky
club for podiatrists...

446
00:36:21,295 --> 00:36:23,490
but I've been speaking with
a lot of Japanese-Americans...

447
00:36:23,664 --> 00:36:26,633
in the past few days who say
that our recent crime wave...

448
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:29,634
is reminiscent of a secret band
of ninja thieves...

449
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,635
who once operated in Japan.

450
00:36:31,806 --> 00:36:34,206
Are the police
looking into this?

451
00:36:34,375 --> 00:36:36,275
I've included everything
in my statement...

452
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:39,242
but I doubt very much
that Chief terns...

453
00:36:39,413 --> 00:36:41,745
is taking this possible
connection seriously.

454
00:36:41,916 --> 00:36:44,908
Well, perhaps
if any of our viewers...

455
00:36:45,086 --> 00:36:46,246
Oh, God.

456
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,513
Mr. Pennington,
Chief terns' office.

457
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,124
Pennington, I thought
we had a deal!

458
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:56,127
You still haven't told us how
you got away from your attacker.

459
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:59,266
It's really quite incredible.

460
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:02,596
ome citizens of New York
actually came to my rescue.

461
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:06,365
Who says everyone in the
Big Apple looks the other way?

462
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:09,668
eriously, June, I would like
to take this opportunity...

463
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:13,109
to thank one of those
individuals in particular.

464
00:37:13,281 --> 00:37:16,079
And if he's watching,
thanks, Raphael.

465
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:19,376
tudly!

466
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:22,750
Hey, look.
I think he's blushing.

467
00:37:22,924 --> 00:37:24,516
I am not.

468
00:37:24,692 --> 00:37:26,683
I think he's
actually turning red.

469
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,726
Maybe not.

470
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:34,993
o what do we do now?

471
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:37,433
What do you mean,
what do we do now?

472
00:37:37,605 --> 00:37:39,095
plinter's out there somewhere!

473
00:37:39,273 --> 00:37:40,672
I know plinter's out there.

474
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,240
- Fight?
- Fight.

475
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,809
- Kitchen?
- Kitchen.

476
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,343
What are we gonna do about it?

477
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,742
What can we do about it?

478
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:50,247
April's our only link
to these guys.

479
00:37:50,418 --> 00:37:52,784
We have to wait until she
comes up with something.

480
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:58,551
o that's the plan
from our great leader?

481
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:00,489
Just sit here on our butts.

482
00:38:00,661 --> 00:38:03,494
I never said
I was a great leader.

483
00:38:03,664 --> 00:38:05,461
You sure
act like it sometimes.

484
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:09,000
Well, you act like a jerk
sometimes.

485
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,730
And this attitude of yours
isn't helping anything.

486
00:38:11,906 --> 00:38:14,932
Maybe I'll just take
my attitude and leave!

487
00:38:15,109 --> 00:38:16,770
- Why don't you?
- I will!

488
00:38:16,944 --> 00:38:18,775
- Good!
- Great!

489
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:20,811
Go ahead.
We don't need you!

490
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:26,744
- Pork rind?
- Pork rind.

491
00:38:26,921 --> 00:38:28,786
Damn!

492
00:39:10,231 --> 00:39:13,132
Move it, will you?

493
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,927
You're letting him
blow right by you!

494
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,933
Can you believe this guy?

495
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,935
Don't just...

496
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:22,837
Ninja-kick the damn rabbit!
Do something!

497
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:25,877
April, you were great.

498
00:39:26,047 --> 00:39:27,036
Thanks, Mikey.

499
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:30,308
he called me Mikey.

500
00:39:34,889 --> 00:39:37,915
- Hear anything yet?
- Not yet.

501
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:41,220
They're going to repeat the
interview at 5:00 and at 6:00...

502
00:39:41,395 --> 00:39:44,125
and we're going
to have to wait and see...

503
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,789
if it helps generate
any new information.

504
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,128
I told them
to call me here immediately...

505
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,066
if anyone calls the station.

506
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,399
Thanks, April.

507
00:39:53,574 --> 00:39:56,509
We really appreciate,
you know, everything.

508
00:39:56,677 --> 00:39:59,373
Forget it.

509
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:03,078
Where's Raphael?

510
00:40:08,956 --> 00:40:12,858
I was going to give you guys
a tour of the store.

511
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:14,619
hall we go get him?

512
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:19,497
He just needs
to blow off some steam.

513
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:24,366
You must be studying the
abridged book of ninja fighting.

514
00:40:38,886 --> 00:40:40,513
I mean, come on.

515
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,680
How do you guys
expect to beat me?

516
00:40:45,993 --> 00:40:48,325
Good answer.

517
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:53,090
I only keep it open part-time,
mostly for my dad.

518
00:40:53,267 --> 00:40:56,259
He loved junk. I don't know.

519
00:40:56,437 --> 00:40:58,337
I guess it's kind of dumb
to lose money on a business...

520
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:00,838
just because
you miss your father.

521
00:41:01,008 --> 00:41:02,475
No, it isn't.

522
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:06,105
Ready?

523
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,181
This place has everything.

524
00:41:16,357 --> 00:41:18,086
Just about.

525
00:41:30,137 --> 00:41:32,332
Hasn't Raph
been gone a long time?

526
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:35,236
He does it all the time.
He likes it.

527
00:41:37,278 --> 00:41:38,575
Are you sure?

528
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,738
Don't worry. He'll probably
be back any minute.

529
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:48,911
- Is he...
- No, he's alive... barely.

530
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:04,026
And I thought
insurance salesmen were pushy.

531
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,541
A fellow chucker, eh?

532
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,213
Keep practicing.

533
00:42:58,225 --> 00:42:59,658
Take that!

534
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,898
One of these guys knows where
they're holding plinter...

535
00:43:09,069 --> 00:43:11,503
so don't knock them all out.

536
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:14,664
I don't think
that will be a problem, Leo.

537
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:26,678
Gotcha.

538
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:33,324
Hey, Donnie,
Wheel of Fortune, dude.

539
00:43:38,132 --> 00:43:39,724
Bisentos now!

540
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:44,531
I guess
they're not game show fans.

541
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:47,071
And I thought
everybody loved Vanna.

542
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,637
California roll!

543
00:43:53,814 --> 00:43:55,805
What a spaz.

544
00:43:55,983 --> 00:43:56,972
Missed again.

545
00:43:57,151 --> 00:43:58,311
Good thing these guys
aren't lumberjacks.

546
00:43:58,485 --> 00:43:59,509
No joke.

547
00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:03,487
The only thing safe
in the woods would be the trees.

548
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:08,218
Guys, I'm not so sure if this
is, structurally speaking...

549
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:12,354
such a good time
for your buddies to drop in.

550
00:44:22,609 --> 00:44:24,736
Whoa, wipeout.

551
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:19,694
Man, we could really use
Raph right about now.

552
00:45:27,241 --> 00:45:28,640
Now what?

553
00:45:33,013 --> 00:45:35,345
You guys mind telling me...

554
00:45:35,516 --> 00:45:38,508
what you're doing to
my little green pal over there?

555
00:45:40,454 --> 00:45:43,184
Who is the babe?

556
00:45:43,357 --> 00:45:45,655
Who the heck is that?

557
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:49,023
Wayne Gretzky on steroids?

558
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:51,391
Attack!

559
00:46:08,048 --> 00:46:10,516
We got to get out of here.

560
00:46:16,590 --> 00:46:19,753
Help me. There used to be
a trapdoor here to the basement.

561
00:46:19,927 --> 00:46:22,919
Come on, you all! Three more!

562
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,723
We're getting out of here.

563
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:33,106
Get away, man.
I'll take care of these guys.

564
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:36,240
You coming?

565
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,435
I'll cover you.

566
00:46:38,612 --> 00:46:40,045
Good idea.

567
00:46:44,017 --> 00:46:47,009
Hi, this is April.
Leave a message after the beep.

568
00:46:48,288 --> 00:46:50,051
April, it's Charles.

569
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,556
I'm sorry. I don't know
how else to say this.

570
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,057
You're fired, April.

571
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,356
I'm sorry.
I know this comes as a blow.

572
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,059
You can say that again, Chuck.

573
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,758
Come on!

574
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:03,926
Bye, guys. Got to run.

575
00:47:07,674 --> 00:47:09,335
Ninja, vanish.

576
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:55,247
What are these... freaks?

577
00:47:55,422 --> 00:47:58,914
How do they know how
to fight like this?

578
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:04,220
You will answer.

579
00:48:06,066 --> 00:48:09,035
Then hang there until you die.

580
00:48:44,237 --> 00:48:45,568
Master Tatsu, stop, please.

581
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:47,468
Please, stop it.

582
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:55,437
hinsho.

583
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,583
You'll be all right.

584
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:27,340
How can a face so young
wear so many burdens?

585
00:49:27,514 --> 00:49:29,675
o, you can talk.

586
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:34,219
Yes, and I can also listen.

587
00:49:35,589 --> 00:49:39,355
ome say that the path
from inner turmoil...

588
00:49:39,526 --> 00:49:43,462
begins with a friendly ear.

589
00:49:43,630 --> 00:49:48,363
My ear is open
if you care to use it.

590
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:50,469
I don't think so.

591
00:49:50,637 --> 00:49:52,662
What is your name?

592
00:49:55,342 --> 00:49:59,472
And have you no one to go to,
Danny? No parent?

593
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:02,080
My dad couldn't
care less about me.

594
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:05,616
I doubt that is true.

595
00:50:06,853 --> 00:50:08,184
Why?

596
00:50:09,856 --> 00:50:14,657
All fathers care for their sons.

597
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,368
- How's Raphael?
- Not so good.

598
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:30,169
Didn't they use this place
in The Grapes of Wrath?

599
00:50:30,343 --> 00:50:32,311
Very funny.

600
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:36,506
I told you, I haven't been
up here in years.

601
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:44,279
Can you fix it?

602
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:52,028
Does that answer your question?

603
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,691
The block's got a crack
the size of the an Andreas.

604
00:50:55,869 --> 00:50:57,734
Wonderful.

605
00:50:57,904 --> 00:51:00,737
I guess
I've got some walking to do.

606
00:51:00,907 --> 00:51:02,465
What for?

607
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:05,475
Our nearest neighbor
is about four miles away.

608
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:08,478
I need to get to a phone,
and I need to call my boss.

609
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,774
You mean Charles?

610
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:11,440
How did you know that?

611
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:14,587
He left a message on your
machine just before we got out.

612
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:20,891
You just saved yourself
an eight-mile round-tripper.

613
00:51:21,061 --> 00:51:23,052
You were fired.

614
00:51:26,399 --> 00:51:27,957
I just saved myself...

615
00:51:28,135 --> 00:51:31,798
Did you take classes
in insensitivity?

616
00:51:31,972 --> 00:51:33,837
I was just trying
to break it to you easy.

617
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,634
You failed miserably!

618
00:51:35,809 --> 00:51:38,710
Broadzilla, you wouldn't be
here if it weren't for me.

619
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,473
And what do you want?
Do you want a thank you?

620
00:51:41,648 --> 00:51:44,776
It's me who should thank you
for that privilege, right?

621
00:51:44,951 --> 00:51:45,781
Fine!

622
00:51:45,952 --> 00:51:47,783
Thank you.

623
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:49,080
You're welcome!

624
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:56,128
It's kind of like Moonlighting,
isn't it?

625
00:52:06,973 --> 00:52:09,407
It's strange being back
on the old farm.

626
00:52:09,576 --> 00:52:13,478
Even after all these years,
it still feels like home.

627
00:52:13,647 --> 00:52:15,615
My amazing new friends...

628
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:17,875
have suffered
their first real defeat.

629
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:21,885
That's bad enough, but they've
also lost the opportunity...

630
00:52:22,055 --> 00:52:23,886
to find out
about their mentor...

631
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,890
and I'm sure that hurts them
more than anything else.

632
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,393
Each of them deals with
this confusion in his own way.

633
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:33,397
Donatello has found
someone to latch onto.

634
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,627
Not even close, zip neck.

635
00:52:36,803 --> 00:52:39,795
The Professor and Mary Ann,
happily ever after.

636
00:52:39,973 --> 00:52:43,875
No way, atomic mouth.
Gilligan was her main man.

637
00:52:44,044 --> 00:52:46,410
They'd be married
and have six kids by now.

638
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,844
Gilligan was a geek,
barfarooni!

639
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:50,846
You're the geek, camel breath.

640
00:52:51,017 --> 00:52:52,450
Dome head.

641
00:52:53,854 --> 00:52:55,253
Elf lips.

642
00:52:57,524 --> 00:52:59,355
Let's give this a try.

643
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:01,858
ee if this transplant
worked... fungoid.

644
00:53:02,028 --> 00:53:04,360
Here goes. What are we on?

645
00:53:04,531 --> 00:53:05,896
"G."

646
00:53:06,066 --> 00:53:08,261
Here goes, gack face.

647
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,232
I'm ready, hose brain.

648
00:53:18,645 --> 00:53:21,011
It worked.

649
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:27,744
Leonardo, meanwhile, has kept
a constant vigil with Raphael.

650
00:54:03,256 --> 00:54:05,121
He'll be OK.

651
00:54:10,797 --> 00:54:12,628
And then there's Casey Jones...

652
00:54:12,799 --> 00:54:15,495
a nine-year-old
trapped in a man's body.

653
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:19,036
He might almost be cute if it
wasn't for that pigheadedness.

654
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:25,003
He's out with the others,
exercising.

655
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:28,011
Doing something together,
I don't know.

656
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,671
Want some help?

657
00:54:31,217 --> 00:54:32,548
I don't know.

658
00:54:32,719 --> 00:54:36,052
I am your man.
I am Mr. Fix-it.

659
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:37,553
Let's go.

660
00:54:37,724 --> 00:54:39,214
Lead the way, toots.

661
00:54:41,328 --> 00:54:42,386
Toots?

662
00:54:42,562 --> 00:54:44,792
Babe?

663
00:54:45,832 --> 00:54:46,821
weetcakes?

664
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:49,693
Princess!

665
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,361
Do you want to throw me a clue
here? I'm drowning.

666
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,565
You know what? That's OK.

667
00:54:55,742 --> 00:54:57,437
I'll take care of it myself.

668
00:54:57,610 --> 00:54:58,941
That's up to you.

669
00:54:59,112 --> 00:55:01,774
Just don't come around here
asking for my help anymore.

670
00:55:01,948 --> 00:55:03,472
I wouldn't
ask for your help...

671
00:55:03,650 --> 00:55:08,747
if you were the last thing
on the face of this planet.

672
00:55:08,922 --> 00:55:10,549
It's coming along nicely.

673
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:20,191
What?

674
00:55:23,870 --> 00:55:26,737
You're awake!
How do you feel?

675
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:31,138
What's a guy got to do to get
some food around here?

676
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:33,571
He's awake!

677
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:37,774
He wants some food!
Bring some food!

678
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:40,442
You're going to be OK, Raph.

679
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,281
Get a grip, will you?

680
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,188
Listen, Raph...

681
00:55:49,796 --> 00:55:51,855
About what I said before...

682
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:56,925
About not needing you and all...

683
00:55:58,505 --> 00:56:01,599
Leo, don't.

684
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,474
Oh, boy, we missed you.

685
00:56:04,644 --> 00:56:07,738
It's a Kodak moment.

686
00:56:15,355 --> 00:56:18,518
The Turtles are four
once again...

687
00:56:18,691 --> 00:56:20,750
and yet, still not whole.

688
00:56:21,861 --> 00:56:24,386
A lingering doubt remains...

689
00:56:24,564 --> 00:56:27,260
an unknown which
they can't bear to face...

690
00:56:27,434 --> 00:56:29,595
their greatest fear.

691
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:42,207
Your empire flourishes,
Master hredder.

692
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:44,213
What more from the rat?

693
00:56:44,384 --> 00:56:47,217
Nothing. It will not speak.

694
00:56:47,387 --> 00:56:50,720
And the boy
who led us to the turtles?

695
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,721
He is still missing.

696
00:56:52,892 --> 00:56:54,883
I do not understand.

697
00:56:55,061 --> 00:56:57,894
Why do the turtles
trouble you, Master?

698
00:56:58,064 --> 00:57:01,227
They have not been seen
for many days.

699
00:57:01,401 --> 00:57:06,737
omething about the way you
described their fighting...

700
00:57:06,906 --> 00:57:09,033
something familiar.

701
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:17,080
omething... from the past.

702
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,087
Ointment?

703
00:58:37,297 --> 00:58:39,288
Funny, Mikey.

704
00:59:05,792 --> 00:59:09,956
What Russian novel, embracing
more than 500 characters...

705
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:12,324
is set in the Napoleonic Wars?

706
00:59:12,498 --> 00:59:13,795
War and Peace.

707
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:14,865
He's alive!

708
00:59:15,034 --> 00:59:16,661
Thanks, spaz.

709
00:59:16,836 --> 00:59:18,303
plinter's alive!

710
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,269
We know, Leo. Of course he is.

711
00:59:21,441 --> 00:59:23,272
We all think he's alive.

712
00:59:23,443 --> 00:59:24,671
I don't think.

713
00:59:24,844 --> 00:59:26,903
I know.

714
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:38,516
Leo, if you dragged us
out here for nothing...

715
00:59:38,691 --> 00:59:41,159
Don't worry. I came prepared.

716
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,692
Put those away.

717
00:59:45,632 --> 00:59:48,567
Everybody close your eyes
and concentrate.

718
00:59:49,569 --> 00:59:51,560
Concentrate hard.

719
01:00:17,964 --> 01:00:21,957
I am proud of you, my sons.

720
01:00:22,135 --> 01:00:24,467
Tonight you have learned...

721
01:00:24,637 --> 01:00:29,472
the final and greatest truth
of the ninja...

722
01:00:29,642 --> 01:00:34,705
that ultimate mastery comes
not of the body...

723
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,645
but of the mind.

724
01:00:37,817 --> 01:00:39,785
Together, there is nothing...

725
01:00:39,952 --> 01:00:43,115
your four minds
cannot accomplish.

726
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:47,123
Help each other.
Draw upon one another.

727
01:00:47,293 --> 01:00:53,289
And always remember
the true force that binds you...

728
01:00:53,466 --> 01:00:58,130
the same as that which
brought me here tonight...

729
01:00:58,304 --> 01:01:03,708
that which I gladly return
with my final words.

730
01:01:04,877 --> 01:01:08,813
I love you all, my sons.

731
01:01:46,652 --> 01:01:48,449
o you actually
played professionally?

732
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:50,452
Before I got hurt.

733
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:52,318
Less than a year.

734
01:01:54,327 --> 01:01:55,624
I'm sorry.

735
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,524
o was I.

736
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,164
Just a minute.

737
01:02:01,334 --> 01:02:02,699
Guys, I told you...

738
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:06,032
I hate it when
you do that, all right?

739
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:07,695
What is it?

740
01:02:08,975 --> 01:02:10,966
It's time to go back.

741
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:36,995
Home sweet home.

742
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:42,137
Now I know what it's like
to travel without a green card.

743
01:02:42,308 --> 01:02:44,173
This isn't bad.
Nice place, guys.

744
01:02:46,546 --> 01:02:48,309
You coming or not, dude?

745
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:54,880
This is great.

746
01:02:55,054 --> 01:02:58,114
First, it's the farm
that time forgot, and now this.

747
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:02,057
Why don't I ever fall in
with people who own condos?

748
01:03:02,228 --> 01:03:05,629
Guess it's hard to get
good maid service in a sewer.

749
01:03:05,798 --> 01:03:08,289
Maybe you guys should try
Roto-rooter.

750
01:03:08,468 --> 01:03:11,631
Would you quit complaining?
It's just for the night.

751
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:15,137
I still don't see why we don't
get started right away.

752
01:03:15,308 --> 01:03:16,969
It's been a long drive, Raph...

753
01:03:17,143 --> 01:03:19,976
and before we go out advertising
to The Foot that we're back...

754
01:03:20,146 --> 01:03:22,546
we could all use
a few hours' sleep.

755
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,706
You're right. I'm just...

756
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:25,873
What's that?

757
01:03:29,522 --> 01:03:30,887
Don't shoot!

758
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:33,048
I don't think it's loaded, kid.

759
01:03:33,226 --> 01:03:35,217
Danny, what are you doing here?

760
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:37,624
- Hey, where'd he come from?
- Beats me.

761
01:03:37,797 --> 01:03:39,628
I ran away from home.

762
01:03:39,799 --> 01:03:42,962
Your father's
going to have kittens.

763
01:03:43,135 --> 01:03:44,295
Does this thing work?

764
01:03:46,205 --> 01:03:47,365
Please don't call.

765
01:03:47,540 --> 01:03:49,235
Just let me stay here
the night with you.

766
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,807
We can call in the morning.
I promise.

767
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:51,807
Danny, listen...

768
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:53,309
Hold on.

769
01:03:53,479 --> 01:03:58,507
What is all this talk about
spending the night down here?

770
01:03:58,684 --> 01:04:00,948
You're a claustrophobic.

771
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:04,482
Do you want a fist in the mouth?

772
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:08,758
I've never even looked
at another guy before.

773
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:12,625
What he means is that you're
afraid of enclosed areas.

774
01:04:12,798 --> 01:04:13,890
Afraid?

775
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:20,265
What, me?
Is that what you think?

776
01:04:20,439 --> 01:04:24,466
I don't have to take
this stuff about being afraid.

777
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,471
I'm going to sleep in the truck.

778
01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:41,286
These are good.

779
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,128
Do you think
maybe I could have one?

780
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,630
ure. Why not?

781
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:48,960
I could really go...

782
01:04:49,135 --> 01:04:51,467
for a little deep-dish action
right about now.

783
01:04:51,637 --> 01:04:53,832
I had some pizza down here
the other day.

784
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:56,031
There might be some left over.

785
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:03,713
- Well?
- Question.

786
01:05:03,883 --> 01:05:06,875
Do you like penicillin
on your pizza?

787
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,665
"Afraid of enclosed areas."

788
01:05:50,429 --> 01:05:55,423
You are here because
the outside world rejects you.

789
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:59,037
And you have
no one to go to, Danny?

790
01:05:59,205 --> 01:06:00,695
This is your family.

791
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:04,639
All fathers
care for their sons.

792
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:16,270
Look out, man.

793
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:45,303
I have not seen you for days.

794
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:50,108
I've been down
at my hideout a lot lately.

795
01:07:50,282 --> 01:07:55,117
And do you now hide from
your surrogate family as well?

796
01:07:58,124 --> 01:07:59,955
I don't know.

797
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:04,529
l, too, once
had a family, Danny.

798
01:08:05,798 --> 01:08:10,132
Many years ago,
I lived in Japan...

799
01:08:10,302 --> 01:08:13,294
a pet of my master Yoshi...

800
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:16,236
mimicking his movements
from my cage...

801
01:08:16,408 --> 01:08:20,970
and learning the mysterious art
of ninjitsu.

802
01:08:21,147 --> 01:08:25,982
For Yoshi was one of Japan's
finest shadow warriors.

803
01:08:26,152 --> 01:08:31,852
His only rival was a man
named Oruku aki...

804
01:08:32,024 --> 01:08:35,118
and they competed
in all things...

805
01:08:35,294 --> 01:08:40,459
but none more fiercely
than for the love of a woman...

806
01:08:40,633 --> 01:08:42,726
Tang hen.

807
01:08:44,303 --> 01:08:47,136
hen's love
was only for my master...

808
01:08:47,306 --> 01:08:51,140
and rather than see him fight
aki for her hand...

809
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:55,474
she persuaded Yoshi
to flee with me to America.

810
01:08:55,648 --> 01:08:58,139
But aki vowed vengeance.

811
01:08:58,317 --> 01:09:03,277
I remember it well
as my master returned home...

812
01:09:03,455 --> 01:09:07,289
to find his beloved hen
lying on the floor.

813
01:09:07,459 --> 01:09:09,984
And then he saw her killer.

814
01:09:10,162 --> 01:09:13,654
aki wasted no words,
and during the struggle...

815
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,266
my cage was broken.

816
01:09:15,434 --> 01:09:18,801
I leapt to aki's face,
biting and clawing...

817
01:09:18,971 --> 01:09:20,700
but he threw me to the floor...

818
01:09:20,873 --> 01:09:24,536
and took one swipe with
his katana, slicing my ear.

819
01:09:25,978 --> 01:09:29,379
Then he was gone,
and I was alone.

820
01:09:32,318 --> 01:09:36,311
Whatever happened
to this Oruku aki?

821
01:09:37,489 --> 01:09:40,117
No one really knows.

822
01:09:40,292 --> 01:09:44,626
But you wear his symbol
upon your brow.

823
01:10:16,295 --> 01:10:18,627
What are you
doing in there, boy?

824
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,287
Nothing.

825
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:31,871
Where have you been?

826
01:10:32,044 --> 01:10:34,638
Nowhere.

827
01:10:34,813 --> 01:10:37,145
You're lying to me.

828
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:40,342
And you're hiding
something as well.

829
01:11:06,645 --> 01:11:08,306
They're back!

830
01:11:12,384 --> 01:11:14,318
Master.

831
01:11:14,486 --> 01:11:17,284
There will be
no mistake this time.

832
01:11:17,456 --> 01:11:19,481
I go myself.

833
01:11:19,658 --> 01:11:21,523
And the rat...

834
01:11:21,694 --> 01:11:23,252
kill it.

835
01:11:30,869 --> 01:11:32,666
What do you want?

836
01:11:32,838 --> 01:11:34,328
Recognize me now, kid?

837
01:11:34,506 --> 01:11:36,201
What's the deal?

838
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,273
You got to come with me!

839
01:11:37,443 --> 01:11:38,876
What are you talking about,
come with you?

840
01:11:39,044 --> 01:11:41,035
They're going to kill plinter.

841
01:12:28,060 --> 01:12:30,051
No sweat.

842
01:12:31,563 --> 01:12:34,555
I do hope
there's more of them.

843
01:12:41,206 --> 01:12:42,366
Good!

844
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:53,574
Where are the keys?

845
01:12:56,722 --> 01:12:59,213
Who are you?

846
01:13:02,561 --> 01:13:04,552
The name's Casey Jones.

847
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:08,722
A friend.

848
01:13:13,906 --> 01:13:16,238
Let's get out of here.

849
01:13:34,993 --> 01:13:36,392
A little to the right...
A little to the left.

850
01:13:36,562 --> 01:13:38,393
One more time.

851
01:13:38,564 --> 01:13:40,395
A little bit
more like... that!

852
01:13:40,566 --> 01:13:42,761
And stop. Perfect.

853
01:13:44,736 --> 01:13:46,727
You're a natural, sis.

854
01:13:56,048 --> 01:14:01,111
A little Primatene might just
help to clear that up there.

855
01:14:03,722 --> 01:14:06,020
That's going to cost you,
Tinkerbell.

856
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:10,627
I don't think
that you're listening.

857
01:14:16,735 --> 01:14:19,067
You know,
I'm starting to pick up...

858
01:14:19,238 --> 01:14:22,401
on a little language barrier
thing going here.

859
01:14:44,196 --> 01:14:45,458
Fore!

860
01:14:54,573 --> 01:14:57,565
I'll never call golf
a dull game again.

861
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:04,237
Gangway!

862
01:15:17,062 --> 01:15:18,529
how-off!

863
01:15:20,065 --> 01:15:23,091
What are we just standing
here for? Let's get him!

864
01:15:24,736 --> 01:15:27,204
Do you want to be first, Junior?

865
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:30,300
We have a loyalty
to The hredder.

866
01:15:30,475 --> 01:15:32,306
The hredder uses you.

867
01:15:32,477 --> 01:15:37,141
He poisons your minds to obtain
that which he desires.

868
01:15:39,084 --> 01:15:43,043
He cares nothing for you
or the people you hurt.

869
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:46,580
We're a family.

870
01:15:48,193 --> 01:15:52,061
Family? Is that what you said?

871
01:15:52,231 --> 01:15:58,295
You call this here
and that down there "family"?

872
01:16:35,641 --> 01:16:38,007
Hey, dudes, where you going?

873
01:16:39,378 --> 01:16:43,337
Donnie, looks like this one's
suffering from shell shock.

874
01:16:43,515 --> 01:16:45,312
Too derivative.

875
01:16:47,286 --> 01:16:49,516
Boy, I guess we can
really shell it out.

876
01:16:49,688 --> 01:16:51,519
Too cliche.

877
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:55,558
Well, it was
a shell of a good hit.

878
01:16:55,727 --> 01:16:58,025
I like it. Tep up.

879
01:16:59,831 --> 01:17:01,230
Awesome!

880
01:17:04,503 --> 01:17:07,472
Where do you think you're going?

881
01:17:13,145 --> 01:17:15,875
Wait for me!

882
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,542
God, I love being a turtle!

883
01:18:07,065 --> 01:18:08,623
Aw, no more?

884
01:18:23,081 --> 01:18:27,916
Does anybody have any idea
about who or what this is?

885
01:18:28,086 --> 01:18:29,178
I don't know...

886
01:18:29,354 --> 01:18:32,323
but I'll bet it never has
to look for a can opener.

887
01:18:32,491 --> 01:18:36,518
You fight well
in the old style...

888
01:18:36,695 --> 01:18:40,153
but you've caused me
enough trouble.

889
01:18:40,332 --> 01:18:43,324
Now you face...

890
01:18:43,502 --> 01:18:45,299
The hredder.

891
01:18:47,806 --> 01:18:50,934
Maybe all that hardware's
for making coleslaw.

892
01:18:51,109 --> 01:18:53,168
I got him.

893
01:18:58,583 --> 01:18:59,914
This guy's good.

894
01:19:00,085 --> 01:19:02,576
Why don't you go next?

895
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,321
Match you for it?

896
01:19:13,465 --> 01:19:15,456
Damn. Great.

897
01:19:18,103 --> 01:19:19,764
Come on.

898
01:19:26,912 --> 01:19:28,903
o much for family.

899
01:19:34,052 --> 01:19:38,489
Now... at exactly what point...

900
01:19:38,657 --> 01:19:40,716
did we lose control here?

901
01:19:40,892 --> 01:19:45,386
Maybe somebody ought to tell
him that we're the good guys.

902
01:19:45,564 --> 01:19:46,553
Any thoughts?

903
01:19:46,731 --> 01:19:48,392
I've only got one thought.

904
01:19:48,567 --> 01:19:51,263
This guy knows
where plinter is.

905
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:59,440
Looks like your boys are
going to need a little...

906
01:19:59,611 --> 01:20:02,079
Where did he go?

907
01:20:23,068 --> 01:20:24,330
Leftovers.

908
01:20:52,764 --> 01:20:53,992
It's a talent.

909
01:21:10,615 --> 01:21:12,913
Where's plinter?

910
01:21:13,084 --> 01:21:15,109
Ah, the rat.

911
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:17,585
o it has a name.

912
01:21:17,756 --> 01:21:21,021
It had a name.

913
01:21:22,727 --> 01:21:24,661
You lie!

914
01:21:25,864 --> 01:21:27,593
Do I?

915
01:21:35,941 --> 01:21:37,704
He dies.

916
01:21:38,843 --> 01:21:40,140
Weapons.

917
01:21:43,348 --> 01:21:44,508
Now!

918
01:21:53,858 --> 01:21:55,416
Fools.

919
01:21:55,594 --> 01:21:58,324
The three of you
might have overpowered me...

920
01:21:58,496 --> 01:22:00,760
with the loss of but one.

921
01:22:00,932 --> 01:22:05,528
Now your fate will be his!

922
01:22:13,678 --> 01:22:18,741
Yes, Oruku aki,
I know who you are.

923
01:22:18,917 --> 01:22:22,717
We met many years ago...

924
01:22:22,887 --> 01:22:27,620
in the home of my master...
Hamato Yoshi.

925
01:22:33,932 --> 01:22:36,093
It's him.

926
01:22:40,872 --> 01:22:46,105
Now I will finish
what I began with your ear.

927
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:03,052
Death comes for us all,
Oruku aki...

928
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:06,322
but something much worse
comes for you.

929
01:23:06,498 --> 01:23:08,796
For when you die, it will be...

930
01:23:18,710 --> 01:23:21,110
Without honor.

931
01:23:32,891 --> 01:23:34,882
plinter, are you OK?

932
01:23:37,395 --> 01:23:39,625
We were so worried.

933
01:23:39,798 --> 01:23:41,095
Kids.

934
01:24:09,327 --> 01:24:11,192
All right, guys,
let's get to it.

935
01:24:16,334 --> 01:24:18,894
April, here.

936
01:24:19,904 --> 01:24:21,838
What's this for?

937
01:24:22,006 --> 01:24:23,871
It's something I owe you.

938
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:25,031
Trust me.

939
01:24:28,680 --> 01:24:30,147
Dad!

940
01:24:34,419 --> 01:24:36,250
Where have you been?

941
01:24:36,421 --> 01:24:39,015
I've had the whole city
looking for you.

942
01:24:39,190 --> 01:24:41,681
Are you all right?

943
01:24:41,860 --> 01:24:43,725
It's OK, Dad. I'm OK, really.

944
01:24:43,895 --> 01:24:46,762
And, Dad?

945
01:24:46,931 --> 01:24:49,923
It's just Dan now, OK?

946
01:24:58,743 --> 01:24:59,971
What have you been up to, freak?

947
01:25:00,145 --> 01:25:01,942
I want some stretchers in here.
Get some doctors.

948
01:25:02,113 --> 01:25:03,102
On the sidewalk. Don't move.

949
01:25:03,281 --> 01:25:04,270
Get those kids over there.

950
01:25:04,449 --> 01:25:06,007
Don't let them get away.
I want to talk to them.

951
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:09,483
April, I told you
there were circumstances.

952
01:25:09,654 --> 01:25:12,316
I really need you to cover this.

953
01:25:12,490 --> 01:25:13,821
I don't know, Charles.

954
01:25:13,992 --> 01:25:16,984
Did you know that May Williams
over at Channel Five...

955
01:25:17,162 --> 01:25:18,652
has her own office?

956
01:25:18,830 --> 01:25:20,127
You can have an office.

957
01:25:20,298 --> 01:25:22,289
he has her own corner office.

958
01:25:22,467 --> 01:25:24,025
You can have a corner office.

959
01:25:24,202 --> 01:25:27,000
But she's also one of the
highest-paid field reporters...

960
01:25:27,172 --> 01:25:28,332
in New York City.

961
01:25:28,506 --> 01:25:29,837
Now you are.

962
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:36,009
You are a tough negotiator,
Charles.

963
01:25:37,348 --> 01:25:39,873
I want some answers.

964
01:25:40,051 --> 01:25:44,681
What in God's name
happened out here tonight?

965
01:25:44,856 --> 01:25:47,450
omebody better talk to me.

966
01:25:49,727 --> 01:25:52,662
Go check out the east warehouse
over at Lairdman Island.

967
01:25:52,831 --> 01:25:54,731
You'll get your answers there.

968
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:00,761
Let's go.

969
01:26:03,875 --> 01:26:07,038
I've been looking
all over for you.

970
01:26:07,212 --> 01:26:09,112
Casey, hi.

971
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,406
"Hi"?

972
01:26:12,450 --> 01:26:16,682
I look like I just called
Mike Tyson a sissy.

973
01:26:18,189 --> 01:26:20,180
And all you just say is hi?

974
01:26:20,358 --> 01:26:25,057
You don't need
an ambulance, do you?

975
01:26:25,230 --> 01:26:27,494
No, but... I was...

976
01:26:27,665 --> 01:26:28,962
Will you just shut up
and kiss me?

977
01:26:29,133 --> 01:26:30,691
I got a report to do.

978
01:26:33,504 --> 01:26:34,835
I love it when you're pushy.

979
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:43,372
9.95!

980
01:26:47,886 --> 01:26:49,615
That's the way to go!

981
01:26:49,787 --> 01:26:52,415
We were awesome!

982
01:26:52,590 --> 01:26:55,354
Bodacious!

983
01:26:55,526 --> 01:26:57,721
Bitchin'.

984
01:26:59,530 --> 01:27:01,464
Gnarly.

985
01:27:01,633 --> 01:27:03,430
Radical.

986
01:27:04,435 --> 01:27:05,766
Totally tubular, dude.

987
01:27:05,937 --> 01:27:08,098
Wicked!

988
01:27:08,273 --> 01:27:10,104
Hellacious!

989
01:27:10,275 --> 01:27:12,470
Uh, mega...

990
01:27:13,544 --> 01:27:16,707
I have always liked...

991
01:27:19,350 --> 01:27:21,079
Cowabunga.

992
01:27:27,792 --> 01:27:29,760
I made a funny.
