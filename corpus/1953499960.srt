1
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,971
Hey, good morning!

2
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,745
Last night was -- it was
awesome.

3
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:50,516
Yeah.

4
00:00:55,855 --> 00:00:58,357
What time is it?

5
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,393
Why, you got some place you
need to be?

6
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:20,045
Work? That sucks.

7
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:26,251
I was hoping that you'd stay
here and smoke some of this
"dank nug" with me.

8
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,053
Hey, you know --

9
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:31,790
-- we should get together
sometime and do this again.

10
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:35,961
Yeah, just give me a call
sometime.

11
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:40,399
Hey, I got a pen around here
somewhere if -- if I could just
find it.

12
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:46,705
Okay.

13
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,774
Hey! You better watch where
you're going!

14
00:03:28,776 --> 00:03:30,475
"Qu'est-ce la chance?"

15
00:03:30,477 --> 00:03:33,011
Lynn. The fuck are you?

16
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:35,514
Copacetic. In the cosmic sense.

17
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:37,149
How's your mom these days?

18
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,019
Fine. She's good.

19
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:45,490
So, I don't know if you've
heard, but I just moved in with
some friends here.

20
00:03:45,492 --> 00:03:48,727
Here? As in Columbia?

21
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:51,296
Well, Rosemary Lane, but same
difference.

22
00:03:51,298 --> 00:03:54,032
Great.

23
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,335
So, you should make it out to
ecstatic dance sometime.

24
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,570
What's "ecstatic dance"?

25
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:02,307
Okay, so we all get together
Sunday mornings at the armory.

26
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:06,545
And we, well -- I -- put
together this music.

27
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:10,349
And, everybody just sort of
follows the rhythm of the music.

28
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,518
Really.

29
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,857
It's -- okay. It's basically
about this moment where you
find yourself at this higher
place.

30
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:23,195
Your mind is at a higher level,
but your body's vibrating.

31
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:28,267
You feel the music and your
body just completely follows
suit.

32
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,271
So when does all this happen?

33
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:34,873
Sunday mornings at the armory.

34
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,241
Sunday mornings when?

35
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:39,878
9:00 AM. You should make it out!

36
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,916
Yeah, well, if I don't it
probably has more to do with
that whole Sunday morning at
9:00 AM thing, you know?

37
00:04:44,918 --> 00:04:48,353
Right. Well, if you change your
mind -- Yeah, probably not.

38
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,956
Um, okay. Well, it was really
nice to see you --

39
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,591
It was good to see you too,
Lynn.

40
00:05:14,847 --> 00:05:18,016
Brad, Pizza for Brad. Come get
your pizza, Brad. Hurry up.

41
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:21,286
Hey.

42
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:24,723
Hey.

43
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,860
Hey, you want a soda with that?

44
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:32,197
Yes please.

45
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:32,798
Thank you.

46
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,803
Howdy strangers.

47
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,771
Hey there.

48
00:05:39,773 --> 00:05:40,906
Cookie and a soda?

49
00:05:40,908 --> 00:05:42,140
Sure thing.

50
00:05:42,142 --> 00:05:43,241
And for you?

51
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,343
Just a cookie.

52
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:45,177
Nothing to drink?

53
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,779
Water's fine.

54
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:54,353
$4.93 for you.

55
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,922
$2.95 for you.

56
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,530
Hello, Kirsten.

57
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,767
Straub. What's shakin'?

58
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:14,005
I know you're off tomorrow
night, because -- you're off
every night -- but you should
stop by around closing.

59
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:16,641
Oh yeah?

60
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:21,813
Yeah, I don't know if you've
heard but ... Jeremy's moving
to Austin to keep the band
going.

61
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:24,483
So, no hard feelings, we're
getting together tomorrow night
...

62
00:06:24,485 --> 00:06:27,986
...you know, going to toast the
deal and make it legal.

63
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,688
Well, maybe I'll stop by.

64
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:32,791
Yeah, you should stop by!

65
00:06:32,793 --> 00:06:36,928
But, what's really at the heart
of it, is that we're going to
need somebody to take over his
shift starting next week.

66
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,131
Sure, makes sense.

67
00:06:39,133 --> 00:06:43,935
So, what do you think?

68
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:47,038
Do you mean do I want to take
Jeremy's bartending shift?

69
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,076
You know the deal, six to close
Tuesday through Saturday.

70
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:56,815
Since you'll be working thirty
hours a week, you can even buy
into our employee health
insurance plan.

71
00:06:56,817 --> 00:07:01,753
I mean, I appreciate the offer
and everything, but --

72
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:08,093
-- I don't understand why
anyone would want to give up
part of their paycheck every
single week

73
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:11,263
when they're still perfectly
healthy.

74
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:15,934
'Cause it's like, if you get
sick, you get sick, and then
you have to pay a ton of money
anyway --

75
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,304
-- it just seems like a little
bit of a scam to me.

76
00:07:19,306 --> 00:07:23,675
Well, you at least want to
think about it?

77
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:25,877
Think about it, at least.

78
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:48,600
Hey, we need a miracle!

79
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,568
Yeah, me too.

80
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:01,079
What's up, small fry? What's on
the menu?

81
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:11,156
Nice!

82
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,892
It got sent back, but it's only
been sitting there for like
thirty minutes,though.

83
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:17,529
Cool!

84
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:23,335
Hey wait. Who's that girl you
were hanging out with at
Eastside the other night?

85
00:08:23,337 --> 00:08:27,105
Uh, Beth? She's cool.

86
00:08:27,107 --> 00:08:35,814
It's her first year at MU, she
moved here from Baltimore last
fall, she's nice.

87
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:37,816
Where'd you two crazy kids meet?

88
00:08:37,818 --> 00:08:40,986
Shakespeare's, where else?

89
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:44,756
Right. I forget sometimes.

90
00:08:46,626 --> 00:08:49,794
So I guess you heard Jeremy's
moving to Austin?

91
00:08:49,796 --> 00:08:54,266
No, I hadn't, but to be honest
-- it doesn't surprise me.

92
00:08:54,268 --> 00:08:57,402
I'd be surprised if Jeremy
weren't moving to Austin!

93
00:08:57,404 --> 00:09:00,839
I never hear anyone say they're
going to move to Tulsa,
Oklahoma.

94
00:09:00,841 --> 00:09:04,709
Or, like Casper, Wyoming. I
mean ...

95
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:11,616
... like Austin, Texas or
Olympia, Washington or Chicago
...

96
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:17,088
... what do those places have
that we don't have here in
Columbia, Missouri?

97
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:22,160
Whataburger, K Records, Old
Style.

98
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:25,730
That's just three.

99
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:30,769
A bunch of people are getting
together at Shakes to give
Jeremy a proper send-off.

100
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,471
You want to come?

101
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:35,640
So we can all go get drunk with
the same people we always get
drunk with

102
00:09:35,642 --> 00:09:39,277
at the same place we always get
drunk at -- one last time?

103
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,013
Don't be hatin'.

104
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,988
Hey kitty!

105
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,667
Oh hey, Dennie.

106
00:10:02,669 --> 00:10:08,340
Hey, I hope you don't mind, I
let myself in. Had to fix the
relay compressor on the fridge.

107
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,009
I tried calling, I even left a
message.

108
00:10:11,011 --> 00:10:16,681
Yeah, well my cell got turned
off, and uh -- the machine's
dead, so ...

109
00:10:16,683 --> 00:10:22,621
Right. Well, as long as you're
here, I should mention that I'm
going to be selling the place.

110
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:25,223
Really? To who?

111
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,358
Whoever wants it.

112
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,062
So does that mean that Katie
and I have to move out?

113
00:10:31,064 --> 00:10:33,898
It depends on who buys it, what
they want to do with it ...

114
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,135
... whether or not I can even
sell the goddamned place.

115
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,604
So, uh, we'll just have to see.

116
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:42,540
Yeah, well, it's a great house,
so --

117
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:48,480
-- I mean, I'm sure that it's
going to move, especially,
like, in this market. You know?

118
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,583
Well, you know you guys got
right of first refusal on this
place.

119
00:10:51,585 --> 00:10:54,719
What's that, like, we have the
right to refuse to buy it?

120
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,788
Okay.

121
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:59,424
Look, mention it to Katie, okay?

122
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,060
I'm going to list it for
one-o-two, but ...

123
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:03,962
... it's hers in a heartbeat
for eighty-eight if she wants
it.

124
00:11:03,964 --> 00:11:06,097
Thousand?

125
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,566
Mention it to Katie.

126
00:11:08,568 --> 00:11:13,271
She could -- well, you could --
own this place in ten years or
so

127
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:16,241
for what the lot of you guys
are choking up in rent every
month.

128
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:19,944
Yeah, but I mean, where am I
going to be in ten years?

129
00:11:19,946 --> 00:11:23,882
It's a pretty uncertain
arrangement, so ...

130
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:27,385
Well, listen. Just mention it
to Katie, okay?

131
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:31,056
I will! Thanks, Dennie.

132
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:33,925
Later later.

133
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:07,492
"You always know when best to
be assertive or to simply wait."

134
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:24,642
Wakey wakey, pudding pie.

135
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:39,691
... what I'll see a lot of
times, sitting on the front
porch --

136
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:44,362
is little birds chasing great
big birds out of the tree.

137
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:48,500
I mean big birds! And they come
flying in, landing on a limb --

138
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,935
and the little bird comes and
chases it out --

139
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,605
and sometimes two or three of
them will chase that big one.

140
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,373
Well, they're territorial ...

141
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:10,955
I know. Why don't you and I go
grocery shopping?

142
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:18,329
Can I at least hose myself off
first?

143
00:13:36,749 --> 00:13:40,218
Can you put your safety belt on?

144
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:45,123
It's just that I get the ticket
if we get pulled over, so ...

145
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:56,334
When do you get your license
back again?

146
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,403
When I can afford to take that
SATOP class.

147
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:01,539
That shit is not cheap.

148
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:07,345
Oh, by the way, Dennie stopped
by today and he said he's
thinking about selling the
house.

149
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:10,849
Shit. Are you serious, we have
to move out?

150
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,551
Well, when were you going to
let me know that?

151
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:15,753
I just did! I just told you!

152
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:21,593
I took a nap, and then I woke
up, and I told you you as soon
as I saw you!

153
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:23,127
Fuck!

154
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,867
We only have to move out if
someone actually decides to buy
the place.

155
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:31,002
Great.

156
00:14:31,004 --> 00:14:33,771
And he said that you had right
of first refusal.

157
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:38,643
For real? Like, what -- what's
he asking?

158
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:42,580
$88,000.

159
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,315
He says it's yours if you want
it.

160
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,787
88?

161
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:04,269
[ canned grocery store music ]

162
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,171
Ooh look! Stuffed portobello
mushrooms!

163
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:45,877
These look good. You just throw
them in the oven, and ...

164
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:49,480
Yeah, you should get them.

165
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:55,586
Yeah. Well, I thinking that we
could go "half-sies" on some of
these groceries?

166
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:59,090
You know, save some money?

167
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:04,295
The problem with that, I think
right now, is ...

168
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:10,268
I have a hard time visualizing
what I'm going to want to eat
three nights from now,

169
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:13,338
'cause I'm not a food psychic,
and ...

170
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,075
... so I just generally pick
stuff up when I'm out on the
town,

171
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:19,310
and then I'm coming home, I'll
get something ...

172
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:20,311
you know, burrito, or whatever,
or ...

173
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,047
Fine! Fine.

174
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,317
Then don't fuck with my
portobello mushrooms.

175
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:29,087
Don't even.

176
00:16:30,522 --> 00:16:31,889
Fine!

177
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,558
These are mine, too.

178
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,593
Okay!

179
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:39,497
Katie.

180
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:44,035
I know. Why don't I just, like,
pick up some beer?

181
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,243
Oh, hey. Can you just let me
out up here on the right?

182
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:56,481
I have a little business to
attend to.

183
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:01,986
Uh, yeah. Well, you just passed
it, but that's fine.

184
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:04,822
Um, just anywhere. Up here is
good.

185
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,999
Oh, um. Do me a hot favor, love
biscuit --

186
00:17:15,001 --> 00:17:20,438
don't forget to put those beers
in the fridge so they're nice
and icy cold when I get home. K?

187
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,375
Later later!

188
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:56,741
Pants!

189
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:57,909
Hey.

190
00:17:57,911 --> 00:17:58,342
- Hey.

191
00:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,013
You want to see my ID?

192
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,581
No.

193
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,117
Thank you, sir.

194
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:19,330
Hi!

195
00:18:19,332 --> 00:18:22,300
Hey. What're you having?

196
00:18:22,302 --> 00:18:26,437
How about a "Bully Wheat."

197
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:37,315
There you go.

198
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,650
Thanks.

199
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:41,219
You know I'm good for it.

200
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,353
Yeah.

201
00:18:53,665 --> 00:18:54,866
That's just wrong.

202
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,345
... no, this is not "new age,"
this is older than time.

203
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:10,081
No, it's not "new age," but --
oh, Kirsten!

204
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,415
It's my friend Kirsten!

205
00:19:11,417 --> 00:19:15,453
Kirsten, hey! Twice in one day,
huh?

206
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,555
The odds.

207
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,224
So I want you to meet my
friends Doug and Charity.

208
00:19:20,226 --> 00:19:20,858
What's up?

209
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,959
Hi.

210
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:23,027
They're in town from Boulder.

211
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,163
Of course they are.

212
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:28,900
So anyway, it's kind of lucky
we ran into you like this,
because uh ...

213
00:19:28,902 --> 00:19:32,370
Doug and Charity need a place
to crash tonight ...

214
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,506
Yeah, maybe load up on a
"twelve-r" of Stag and hang out?

215
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,375
Sorry guys, couch is taken.

216
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:40,144
Oh, no. Um --

217
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,581
Seriously, Katie's cousin's up
from Lamar, she's going to
theater camp at Stephens.

218
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,317
They're doing "Pippin."

219
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:50,788
That's -- that's actually not
what I was going to say, I was
just going to say that ... um,
maybe --

220
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,591
I'm just saying that maybe we
can think outside the box here,

221
00:19:53,593 --> 00:19:56,194
maybe if you had a backyard
where we could lay down a tarp,

222
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:59,130
or pitch a tent?

223
00:19:59,132 --> 00:20:00,431
No fucking way.

224
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:05,903
Maybe you know about any
affordable camping spots around
here?

225
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:11,209
At least something with public
showers and hopefully not
crawling with rapists,but ...

226
00:20:11,211 --> 00:20:13,244
Yeah.

227
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,279
Excuse me.

228
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:23,821
Um, sorry?

229
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:37,868
Hey, is that Kirsten?

230
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,938
Kirsten! Hey you'ze!

231
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,874
Yes. Hi!

232
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,944
I don't know if I've properly
introduced you to Beth.

233
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:50,881
Beth, this is my esteemed chum
Kirsten.

234
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:52,316
"Esteemed."

235
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,618
Nice to meet you.

236
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,286
Totally.

237
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:58,356
You just moved here from
Baltimore?

238
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:02,627
Yes. My aunt works at MU, so I
had an opportunity to join up
at the journalism school ...

239
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,295
... so, yeah.

240
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:08,633
That's cool. I mean, it's a
good program and, uh ...

241
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:12,637
... it's a great time to be in
journalism with all the ...

242
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:16,607
... stuff that's going on and
everything, so that sounds like
a --

243
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,342
-- really choice opportunity!

244
00:21:18,344 --> 00:21:19,644
Cool, thanks!

245
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:30,288
File under "ironic
coincidences," but my aunt Barb
lives in Columbia, Maryland.

246
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,522
Get out!

247
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:34,191
There's a Columbia, Maryland?

248
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:36,327
Have you been to visit her?

249
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,063
No, but I thought about it.

250
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:45,403
She teaches sign language to
deaf and hearing kids in
integrated classrooms.

251
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:49,040
Wow. That's great!

252
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:54,845
We were just going to go home
because we couldn't figure out
anything else to do tonight ...

253
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:56,781
Tell me about it.

254
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,248
Did you want to go get a drink
at Eastside?

255
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,283
No!

256
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:02,953
No, I don't. I, uh --

257
00:22:02,955 --> 00:22:05,122
Come to think of it, though ...

258
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:07,992
... Beth here is new in town
and maybe we should just take
her

259
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,029
to one of Columbia's more "off
the beaten path" kind of
destinations?

260
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:13,564
Like what?

261
00:22:13,566 --> 00:22:15,566
I'm talking McNally's!

262
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,103
McNally's?

263
00:22:19,105 --> 00:22:25,042
Yes! Oh, my God. McNally's has
quickly endeared itself to me
in so many ways.

264
00:22:25,044 --> 00:22:26,377
Really.

265
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:27,945
I'm game!

266
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,421
I could have sworn it was right
here ...

267
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,924
That's Tony's!

268
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:47,398
I have to pee.

269
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:50,134
I told you it was on Sixth
Street.

270
00:22:50,136 --> 00:22:51,435
I know.

271
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,271
Why wouldn't you listen?

272
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,842
I thought you said this was
your new favorite hangout.

273
00:22:57,844 --> 00:23:01,779
Was? Is. New champion.

274
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,414
How's everyone doing?

275
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,949
Great!

276
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,418
Another one of these for me,
please.

277
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,186
And can I get you guys anything?

278
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:11,188
Actually ...

279
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:14,125
... do you think I could a
ginger ale with bitters?

280
00:23:14,127 --> 00:23:16,527
You know what? That sounds
good, I'll have one of those
too.

281
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:21,098
Great. Well, I'm going to go
and figure out what a "bitters"
is, but --

282
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,633
I'll be right back!

283
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,434
Cheers!

284
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,170
So, Kristen ...

285
00:23:26,172 --> 00:23:26,670
Kirsten.

286
00:23:26,672 --> 00:23:27,671
Kirsten.

287
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:27,972
It's Kirsten.

288
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,910
I hear you work at
Shakespeare's.

289
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:37,848
Indubitably. I work the lunch
rush Monday through Friday.

290
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:41,819
Mike tells me it's something of
a rite of passage around here.

291
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:44,355
Yeah, it's like, "take your
pick," you know?

292
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,292
Do you deliver sandwiches for
the Sub Shop,

293
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:51,128
do you tear tickets at the
Ragtag --

294
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,863
"Do you sleep around at the
Ranch?"

295
00:23:52,865 --> 00:23:55,533
Do you end up bussing tables at
Ernie's?

296
00:23:55,535 --> 00:23:59,170
You know, "take your pick."

297
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,607
Well, I don't know what the
Ranch is, but --

298
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:08,446
-- I do think it's a little
weird that you would allow your
identity

299
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,149
to be so wrapped up in the
social cachet

300
00:24:12,151 --> 00:24:14,118
of a job in the service sector.

301
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,586
What she said.

302
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,324
Well, yes and no, I mean, like
--

303
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:23,794
-- when I first moved to town I
didn't know anyone. So --

304
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,530
-- and I think it's like that
for a lot of people, like --

305
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:28,666
-- the friends you first meet
through work,

306
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:30,968
and then through friends at
work, and then --

307
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:39,143
And before you realize it, all
of these things have come to
define who you are as a person.

308
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:48,686
"McNally's!"

309
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,423
McNally's was pretty awesome.

310
00:24:53,925 --> 00:24:56,560
So you were just going to walk
home?

311
00:24:56,562 --> 00:25:05,002
Well, it's more of a moonlight
constitutional than a
neighborly stroll, I suppose ...

312
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:07,571
... but it's a nice night for
it!

313
00:25:09,474 --> 00:25:13,177
Mike! Let's listen to records!

314
00:25:13,912 --> 00:25:14,979
Nice to meet you!

315
00:25:14,981 --> 00:25:16,180
Nighty night.

316
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:26,190
Oh, shit.

317
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:32,563
"Sub Shop."

318
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:37,935
Is it too late to order
delivery with a credit card?

319
00:25:37,937 --> 00:25:41,672
"We stopped taking orders like
half an hour ago, so ... "

320
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:43,140
God damn it!

321
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:58,322
It's Pepper time!

322
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:05,663
"You're watching KOMU-TV 8.
Live -- it's Pepper and
Friends."

323
00:26:17,275 --> 00:26:18,242
That puppy is so cute!

324
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,651
Pepper.

325
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:28,752
This show.

326
00:26:32,157 --> 00:26:39,229
"Good morning! Welcome to our
show. Monday the 25th, it is
Thanksgiving week ... "

327
00:26:39,231 --> 00:26:41,265
"And didn't we dodge that snow?"

328
00:26:41,267 --> 00:26:46,637
"Oh, yeah. But it's cold
outside! It is cold. If you're
going to go out

329
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,806
-- if you haven't been outside
yet -- man, you go outside and

330
00:26:48,808 --> 00:26:52,476
you might be in for a surprise,
so bundle up warmly."

331
00:26:52,478 --> 00:26:55,312
"When you bundle up, you
usually do bundle up warmly."

332
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,648
"Yeah, warmly. Thursday we're
not going to be here -- "

333
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:24,775
" -- I want you to meet them
all by name. Here we have -- "

334
00:27:24,777 --> 00:27:25,409
"I'm Josh."

335
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,911
"I'm Jeff."

336
00:27:27,913 --> 00:27:29,513
"Now there's one guy who's
missing. Where is the other
one?"

337
00:27:29,515 --> 00:27:32,683
"He couldn't make it today."

338
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,154
(drunken mutterings)

339
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,828
"Then you're playing the spoons
... is that for this song?"

340
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,331
"And then you all have jingle
bells?"

341
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:49,333
"A little bit of rhythm."

342
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:52,069
"And you're just playing -- "

343
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:52,536
"Just a plain old electric
guitar."

344
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,071
"Okay."

345
00:27:54,073 --> 00:27:55,072
"No gimmicks!"

346
00:27:55,074 --> 00:27:59,076
Cheers to you, Jeff Carrillo!

347
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:02,346
You're so cute!

348
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,230
I totally know where you're
coming from.

349
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:24,468
Except when did you guys end up
signing with K Records?

350
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,705
It was fall of 2007.

351
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:31,241
They heard our last album on
Cold Crush, and they liked what
they heard,

352
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:35,512
and we knew each other from all
the requisite industry shindigs,

353
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:36,580
and you know, it was a natural
fit.

354
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:38,382
That is so cool.

355
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:41,719
Yeah, I remember walking into
Salt of the Earth and picking up

356
00:28:41,721 --> 00:28:44,388
that first Dub Narcotic
seven-inch and taking it home,

357
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,256
and it was like ... wow.

358
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,357
Yeah.

359
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,796
You mind if we have a seat?
These heels are killing me.

360
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:55,299
Okay.

361
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:02,539
... I thought, you know this is
so corny, but just for a brief
second,

362
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:04,541
"maybe I'll put a record out on
K one day," you know,

363
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:08,078
just oozing childish naiveté.

364
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,849
Well, here's to the
intersection of fantasy and
reality, right?

365
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:13,584
Cheers.

366
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:15,552
Life's a funny thing sometimes.

367
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:18,722
It's so funny! You know,
because, like, well --

368
00:29:18,724 --> 00:29:22,593
-- I never harbored any
ambition of being, you know,

369
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,561
an internationally renowned
recording artist or anything --

370
00:29:24,563 --> 00:29:26,864
"Down, boy."

371
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:29,266
-- no, but seriously.

372
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:32,603
I used to write the music
reviews for my high school
paper,

373
00:29:32,605 --> 00:29:37,574
and I couldn't carry a tune or
play an instrument to save my
life, but --

374
00:29:37,576 --> 00:29:40,577
-- I always thought, you know,
maybe I could still contribute

375
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,248
to the scene in some meaningful
way, like work for a Thrill
Jockey

376
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:47,084
or a K Records or a Touch and
Go. You know?

377
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:51,288
If you're willing to roll up
your sleeves and put in your
hours at the "merch" table ...

378
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,690
I am so up for it! Seriously.

379
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,593
All right, here's what I'm
thinking. You got a pen?

380
00:29:56,595 --> 00:30:00,097
Pen. Uh ... wait, pocket? No.

381
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,800
Hold on one second.

382
00:30:02,802 --> 00:30:04,968
Excuse me! Does anyone have a
pen?

383
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,171
Anything I could use to write
with ...

384
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,175
Sharpie!

385
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:14,344
I was thinking you should maybe
give Calvin Johnson a call.

386
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,614
Really?

387
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,184
Yeah, I mean maybe he doesn't
have anything percolating at
the moment,

388
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:23,453
but you could just introduce
yourself, do the whole
"hi-how-you-doing" routine

389
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,222
and see where it goes.

390
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,359
Wow. I mean ...

391
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:35,032
that would be amazing, to be a
part of the whole K Records
enterprise!

392
00:30:35,034 --> 00:30:36,900
Cool. All right, are you ready?

393
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:39,403
I am! Okay, shoot!

394
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:46,376
360 - 555 ...

395
00:30:46,378 --> 00:30:50,380
Hang on, let me try that again.
I don't know. Just one more try
--

396
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:54,384
360 - 555 ...

397
00:30:54,386 --> 00:30:57,855
... 7777.

398
00:30:57,857 --> 00:31:00,090
Um, no.

399
00:31:00,092 --> 00:31:06,096
Okay, I don't -- I don't
understand. You know what? Just
tell it to me.

400
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:08,599
I have a killer memory and --
it's -- you know.

401
00:31:08,601 --> 00:31:10,834
A killer memory.

402
00:31:10,836 --> 00:31:13,904
It's a little safety deposit
box up there.

403
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:19,910
360 - 555 - 7777.

404
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:22,512
7777. Got it.

405
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,614
Not even going to write it down.

406
00:31:23,616 --> 00:31:25,282
Nope!

407
00:31:25,284 --> 00:31:27,618
360 - 555 - 7777. I got it.

408
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,354
Well, it was nice to meet you,
Kirsten.

409
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:35,959
You too! And you know, if you
guys are ever in town -- hook
me up!

410
00:31:35,961 --> 00:31:38,896
You got it! All right, bye.

411
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:42,065
Take care of yourself ...

412
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:45,335
... Jeff Carrillo.

413
00:31:49,807 --> 00:31:52,342
360 - 555 ...

414
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,848
360 ...

415
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:08,859
Holy fuck!

416
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:24,107
(smoke alarm, fire extinguisher)

417
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,109
God damn it!

418
00:32:31,849 --> 00:32:33,450
Fuck!

419
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:39,256
Fuck off and die!

420
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:02,145
(alarm clock)

421
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:33,176
Word!

422
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:36,146
You understand what I'm saying!

423
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:39,850
We need to do something because
nobody understands what is
happening with the workers!

424
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:43,854
Just a regular old coffee to go.

425
00:33:45,723 --> 00:33:48,091
It's gonna be $1.87.

426
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,764
Sorry.

427
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:56,400
It's fine.

428
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:17,554
I swear that I wasn't trying to
--

429
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:22,092
Fuck you, fuck off, eat a
fucking dick, I don't fucking
care!

430
00:34:22,094 --> 00:34:24,027
Don't fucking talk to me!

431
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:35,906
Pizza for Stacey with an E-Y.
Stacey with an E-Y, come and
get your pizza already.

432
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,114
Would you like something to
drink with that?

433
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:46,616
I would, please. How about a
Stag?

434
00:34:46,618 --> 00:34:49,052
No problem.

435
00:34:54,992 --> 00:34:57,294
That will be $3.75, please.

436
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,865
Keep the change.

437
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:03,233
Have a great day!

438
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:05,001
Thanks.

439
00:35:07,538 --> 00:35:08,772
Hey guys.

440
00:35:08,774 --> 00:35:10,874
Hey there!

441
00:35:10,876 --> 00:35:13,410
Cookie and a soda ... cookie
and no soda?

442
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,912
Water's fine.

443
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:19,783
You know, you guys really
should ask your parents for a
little extra lunch money.

444
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:24,154
I mean, I'm sure they're
willing to spring for the
occasional soda pop...

445
00:35:27,725 --> 00:35:29,092
You know, I'm sorry.

446
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:32,262
No, no -- it's fine.

447
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,166
No, I shouldn't have said that.

448
00:35:36,168 --> 00:35:42,139
It's fine -- for the both of
us, uh -- keep the change!
Thanks.

449
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:50,180
Do you take Discover?

450
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:55,519
I can't, I'm sorry, I have to
go pick up Beth from school

451
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,654
and then drive her to her
meeting.

452
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:01,057
Meeting? What kind of meeting?

453
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:05,762
It's, uh -- the kind of meeting
where people go and exchange
ideas.

454
00:36:05,764 --> 00:36:08,298
Usually while seated.

455
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,299
You are not cool!

456
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,634
Yeah, I am.

457
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:18,675
No way, it's -- too far.

458
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,566
Please tell me you take
Discover.

459
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,637
Grumble.

460
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,454
Shit!

461
00:38:00,711 --> 00:38:03,813
Please tell me he is not
bartending at his own going
away party.

462
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:06,716
Yep! That's Jeremy for you.

463
00:38:08,919 --> 00:38:09,919
... there's a story by Miranda
July about a dog named Potato --

464
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,354
Hey Straub!

465
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:14,891
Oh. Hey, Kirsten. Talk to
Jeremy yet?

466
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:20,597
Oh. Nah, he looks all busy,
embroiled in conversation, and
--

467
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:22,198
Hey, Kirsten.

468
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,733
Hey, Jeremy.

469
00:38:23,735 --> 00:38:25,702
You look like you need a drink!

470
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:29,439
You know what, I'm good right
now, thanks.

471
00:38:29,441 --> 00:38:34,444
So I was going to ask you about
that job that you asked me
about --

472
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:38,214
Oh, yeah ... Katie's picking up
that shift.

473
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:40,417
Really?

474
00:38:40,419 --> 00:38:42,185
Yeah, she's hungry for it,
she's good to go, and --

475
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:45,855
-- I detected a sense of, shall
we say,

476
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:50,026
tentativeness in my response to
my original inquiry?

477
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,494
Right.

478
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:55,632
Okay, that's fair, I guess.

479
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,868
Thanks anyway!

480
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:08,745
... just as dirty, right?
Because you know how linoleum,

481
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:11,948
in the cracks and the creases
of it, it just gets dirty

482
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,783
and you can't get it out no
matter how hard you scrub,

483
00:39:13,785 --> 00:39:18,321
even with bleach? I hate that.
So then I was --

484
00:39:18,323 --> 00:39:19,022
Hey.

485
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:20,690
Fuck off.

486
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:22,258
I bought groceries!

487
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,427
Well, hoo-fucking-ray.

488
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,765
So I guess you talked to Straub
today.

489
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:33,470
Yeah, and I talked to Dennie
today. Just so you know.

490
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:35,472
Okay.

491
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,007
I'm buying the house. It's
mine. The house is mine.

492
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:39,275
Really.

493
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,277
Yeah, well, fuck it, I mean --

494
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,680
I'm practically paying Dennie's
mortgage as it is

495
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,849
and I figured why not cut out
the middleman, you know?

496
00:39:45,851 --> 00:39:47,851
Right.

497
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:51,020
I mean, I'm months away from
settling, but it's practically
a done deal.

498
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:53,223
Okay, cool.

499
00:39:53,225 --> 00:39:57,193
Could you at least not be such
a total bitch about it between
now and then?

500
00:39:57,195 --> 00:40:01,898
Wow! Uh ... sure, why not?

501
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:05,235
Thanks, Katie!

502
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:06,936
You're welcome.

503
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,408
So I was thinking tile. I could
do that myself --

504
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:17,714
Oh, hey Kirsten. Where you
going?

505
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,916
I'm going to fucking McNally's!

506
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,501
Is that for real?

507
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,570
Yeah, they're leftover from
Halloween.

508
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,605
Let's giddy up.

509
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:52,348
Hey! How much for the whole
shirt? I want it.

510
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,317
Get lost!

511
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:55,618
Yeah, real mature.

512
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:58,188
Yeah, get your old ass out of
here!

513
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,256
I ain't leaving 'til I got that
shirt.

514
00:41:00,258 --> 00:41:05,762
I got sixteen bucks, so that's
like sixteen sucks?

515
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,665
Strike three, captain.

516
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:11,100
Oh, come on!

517
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,139
That guy, huh?

518
00:41:16,141 --> 00:41:17,941
Welcome to my world.

519
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:20,343
Thank you. I love your world.

520
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,513
Hey, "wrong way" --

521
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:25,148
What?

522
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,852
-- I mean "Wang Mei"! I mean --

523
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:31,821
-- get us another round of
"pink tacos," will you?

524
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,590
Copy that.

525
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,825
How many more of those?

526
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,396
What the hell is a "pink taco"?

527
00:41:40,398 --> 00:41:46,069
It's ... Knockov orange,
Knockov strawberry,

528
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:50,240
Knockov raspberry, Knockov sour
apple --

529
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:52,842
Basically it's a pint of vodka.

530
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:55,211
With cranberry and sour.

531
00:41:55,213 --> 00:41:57,480
That's nutty.

532
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:02,085
Hey, we're going to go grab a
smoke. Can you watch our drinks?

533
00:42:02,087 --> 00:42:03,786
You got it.

534
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,856
Killer.

535
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,343
No shit!

536
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,814
Where'd they go?

537
00:42:31,816 --> 00:42:35,552
Just out for a smoke, but --
I'm ready to settle up.

538
00:42:35,554 --> 00:42:36,886
You're not going to start a tab?

539
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,888
Not tonight.

540
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,723
All right, well have a good
night!

541
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,902
Lynn!

542
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,237
Hey.

543
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,371
Small world!

544
00:42:55,373 --> 00:42:56,973
Yep!

545
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:59,542
What's up?

546
00:42:59,544 --> 00:43:04,013
I was just going to check out
McNally's, I got a coupon --
"Ad Sheet"!

547
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:07,350
It's a cool place, I like it a
lot.

548
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,221
Hey, you know what? I just
wanted to let you know that

549
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:16,759
I'm really sorry that I
disappointed you and your
friends the other night,

550
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,862
I've just been fighting a ton
with Katie

551
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:22,198
and just couldn't handle a
couple more people at my house.

552
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,200
You know what I'm saying?

553
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:29,372
Yeah -- they're gone, they took
off late last night, to ...

554
00:43:29,374 --> 00:43:34,877
Champaign to go crash at his
cousin's, so you know ...

555
00:43:34,879 --> 00:43:37,714
Hey listen, if your coupon's
still good for another couple
of days,

556
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:42,085
I have something in this bag
that you might take a shine to.

557
00:43:46,156 --> 00:43:47,223
Shall we?

558
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:53,496
Except ... where are we going
to get a "whip-it cracker" at
this time of night?

559
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,333
We could always stop by the
Olde Un.

560
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:59,802
I have an idea! "Andiamo!"

561
00:44:03,207 --> 00:44:05,942
Kirsten, shit! What's up?

562
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,610
We've come to party, earthlings.

563
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,981
You brought a friend, it's --
Lynn, right?

564
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:13,049
Didn't I give you a lift home
from Mojo's the other night?

565
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:15,451
"Absolutement!"

566
00:44:15,453 --> 00:44:18,721
Can I get you ladies anything
to drink? I got some stones in
the fridge.

567
00:44:18,723 --> 00:44:19,989
Hells yes!

568
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,226
That's pretty awesome ...
they're not cold or nothin,

569
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:25,762
but they're pretty expensive,
so ...

570
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,497
... here you go.

571
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,401
Is he going to be OK?

572
00:44:31,403 --> 00:44:33,569
Yeah, he's fine. That's just
Brantly,

573
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:36,606
just fucking passed out drunk.

574
00:44:36,608 --> 00:44:40,376
Ever since he got this
disgusting nipple piercing at
Dreamcatcher,

575
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:44,347
it's like he won't put his
shirt back on for nothin', and
...

576
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:48,151
it's like he's showing off his
fucking engagement ring or some
shit.

577
00:44:51,622 --> 00:44:52,855
Check this out, hold on.

578
00:44:55,793 --> 00:44:57,894
What the fuck?

579
00:44:57,896 --> 00:44:59,896
Motherfucker!

580
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,771
You can't stay in there
forever, man, I live here now!

581
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,306
Fuck, man!

582
00:45:20,451 --> 00:45:22,385
What the fuck you crazy bitches
want?

583
00:45:23,487 --> 00:45:24,854
We brought "whip-its"!

584
00:45:26,657 --> 00:45:28,191
That sounds pretty good,
actually.

585
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,195
Hey, I'm sorry I called you all
a bunch of crazy bitches --

586
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:34,664
you saw that fucker put hot
sauce in my shit!

587
00:45:34,666 --> 00:45:37,900
You know what would really help
that, actually? Some fresh aloe
vera.

588
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:40,203
Yeah, well, you know what would
be really good?

589
00:45:40,205 --> 00:45:43,039
Some nitrous oxide in my lungs
and brains, "yo."

590
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:45,141
Okay, you got a "whip-it
cracker"?

591
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:47,009
Oh, yeah!

592
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,714
Sweet.

593
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,385
Oh, shit. Balloons!

594
00:45:56,387 --> 00:46:00,189
We got some balloons leftover
from Dawson's birthday party!

595
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,162
Yeah, I know how to treat the
ladies.

596
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,799
So, Brantly, you know my
friend, Lynn?

597
00:46:09,801 --> 00:46:11,200
What's up? I'm Brantly.

598
00:46:11,202 --> 00:46:13,236
"Avec plaisir."

599
00:46:13,238 --> 00:46:15,471
What, are you from Mexico or
some shit?

600
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,810
Hey, you guys ever seen, like,
mixed martial arts fighting?

601
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:23,412
I'm into that shit, man, I
fucking rock out, man ...

602
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:31,420
What're you doing? Give me that.

603
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:34,223
Bunch of amateurs!

604
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:37,960
Show you how it's done -- show
you how we do it!

605
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:04,754
Oh! It's cold, it's cold.

606
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,427
Why, thank you madam.

607
00:47:13,463 --> 00:47:17,366
Dude. I'm fucking flyin', man,
like --

608
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,639
Come to Kirsten!

609
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,627
I want my wings!

610
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:50,366
Oh my God!

611
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:53,836
You all ever go out to the
country, like, late at night,

612
00:47:53,838 --> 00:47:56,372
and like, listen to bullfrogs
and shit?

613
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:58,941
Man -- they talk to you, dude.

614
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:26,335
God damn.

615
00:48:27,871 --> 00:48:29,772
Hey, Kirsten ...

616
00:48:29,774 --> 00:48:34,343
... do you remember that
weekend when we went looking
for the red fern?

617
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,815
It was because we'd both just
read "Where the Red Fern Grows"
...

618
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,422
... and I borrowed your dad's
hacksaw from the garage

619
00:48:46,424 --> 00:48:51,027
because we thought that if we
cut down the red fern,

620
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:55,932
we would be rich for the rest of
our lives?

621
00:48:59,503 --> 00:49:02,271
I needed seven stitches.

622
00:49:03,340 --> 00:49:05,508
I know.

623
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:11,147
On the way to Columbia General,
though, your mom --

624
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:14,517
-- have I told you this story
before?

625
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:22,825
We were speeding down I-70 ...

626
00:49:22,827 --> 00:49:27,363
... and I remember seeing this
station wagon --

627
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:35,438
this white station wagon. It
was over in the right lane,

628
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:40,409
and it was kind of wobbling,
like something was wrong with
the tire.

629
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:51,253
And all of a sudden, it skidded
and hit the shoulder --

630
00:49:53,056 --> 00:49:59,795
ran over the grass, and just
plunged into ...

631
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,002
... into oblivion, I guess.

632
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:13,943
But, your mom -- I remember
your mom,

633
00:50:13,945 --> 00:50:20,316
I looked at her and I said,
"Mrs. Reister, shouldn't we
stop?"

634
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,085
She just looked at me and she
said,

635
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:25,921
"no, honey, we have to get you
to the hospital."

636
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,560
And just kept driving.

637
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:36,732
Really? With all that blood and
everything?

638
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:44,073
So, but -- you said she was
good?

639
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:58,988
She and my dad got a divorce
right after I graduated school
and moved to Columbia.

640
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,292
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

641
00:51:03,294 --> 00:51:07,329
Where does she live now?

642
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:11,734
I can't remember.

643
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,338
Don't you talk to her?

644
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:20,242
Oh, you know, I honestly doubt
she wants to hear

645
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:25,514
that her daughter is a
drunk-driving fuck-up with a
suspended license

646
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:28,818
and $30,000 worth of credit
card debt.

647
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,194
Last call. Any takers?

648
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:41,430
They're all mine.

649
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,373
You know what, guys --

650
00:51:51,375 --> 00:51:58,247
it's times like this that you
really start to learn stuff
about life, you know?

651
00:51:58,249 --> 00:52:02,551
It's like -- you can finally
get a handle on shit, you know,

652
00:52:02,553 --> 00:52:06,155
everything's so hard everyday
and then --

653
00:52:06,157 --> 00:52:09,391
-- suddenly, it's all better.

654
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,633
Holy shit! Kirsten!

655
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:20,136
Whoopsies.

656
00:52:20,138 --> 00:52:20,970
No, Kirsten, don't! Because
you're going to --

657
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:23,806
Damn!

658
00:52:26,209 --> 00:52:27,042
God!

659
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:29,245
Oh, man. That ain't good.

660
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,749
Okay, stay right there, okay?

661
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:37,887
Lynn?

662
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:49,899
Oh my God, Lynn. How bad is it?

663
00:52:51,468 --> 00:52:53,836
What the fuck is going on in
here?

664
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:02,811
Kirsten, this doesn't look so
good.

665
00:53:02,813 --> 00:53:05,814
Damn. You got to get that bitch
to the ER, "yo."

666
00:53:05,816 --> 00:53:07,716
Seek medical attention and shit.

667
00:53:07,718 --> 00:53:08,384
No!

668
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:09,485
We walked here!

669
00:53:09,487 --> 00:53:11,153
You can just use my bike!

670
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:17,560
Todd!

671
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:19,662
Todd!

672
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:22,965
I need to borrow your car.

673
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:25,401
Todd!

674
00:53:27,437 --> 00:53:29,605
I'm so embarrassed I want to
die.

675
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:35,878
Lynn, I don't know how many
times I have to ask, but please
--

676
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:39,348
Just, you know, don't talk!
It's going to be fine!

677
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:42,885
No it isn't, I can't afford
this shit! Just please, just --

678
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:46,055
turn around and take me home,
okay?

679
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:49,458
Maybe we could just call your
Aunt Barb, you know? She's
always been cool.

680
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:53,329
No! You can't do that, please!

681
00:53:53,331 --> 00:53:56,532
We don't have to tell her what
really happened. You could just
--

682
00:53:56,534 --> 00:53:59,368
tell her that you ran into a
door or something, I don't know.

683
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:11,447
Please don't, Lynn. Just
promise me you won't do that,
okay?

684
00:54:12,382 --> 00:54:14,617
Do you take Discover?

685
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:18,320
Um, hi.

686
00:54:18,322 --> 00:54:22,024
Is this Kirsten's Aunt Barb?

687
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:24,693
Kirsten Reister. Yes.

688
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:33,035
Um, I'm a friend of your
niece's, you probably don't
remember me, but I --

689
00:54:33,037 --> 00:54:39,041
I'm here with Kirsten right
now, we're at the hospital --

690
00:54:40,043 --> 00:54:43,679
no, she'll be fine.

691
00:54:43,681 --> 00:54:48,050
She just had a little bit of an
accident, and --

692
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,889
no, no, she'll be fine.

693
00:54:53,891 --> 00:54:59,895
I was just calling, actually,
because I was wondering if --

694
00:54:59,897 --> 00:55:03,032
maybe I could get your credit
card information

695
00:55:03,034 --> 00:55:06,001
and give it to these nice folks
here at the hospital?

696
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:10,205
Yeah.

697
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,809
No, no, you're right, it --

698
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:17,212
it doesn't seem sketchy,
doesn't it?

699
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,857
Yeah, you know --

700
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:32,461
maybe you were right, maybe we
should just get out of here.

701
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:39,702
All I want, Lynn, is just a big
Band-Aid for my face.

702
00:55:42,739 --> 00:55:43,972
Please!

703
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:51,780
It's really starting to clot ...

704
00:55:54,084 --> 00:55:57,753
... I bet that it's going to
scab in a couple of days, and --

705
00:55:57,755 --> 00:56:02,458
in a week, or in a month --

706
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,526
you'll look great!

707
00:56:26,449 --> 00:56:28,450
It's bleeding through a little
bit, so --

708
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:32,855
I'm just going to get that guy.

709
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:34,423
Okay, that's better -- right?

710
00:56:35,525 --> 00:56:37,793
It's a little bit better, right?

711
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:52,107
You know what?

712
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:54,510
I'm going to call you tomorrow.

713
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,880
And I'm going to stop by.

714
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,820
Feel better, okay?

715
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:23,872
My life is over.

716
00:57:29,679 --> 00:57:31,613
You look pretty "beat the fuck
up" there, Kirsten.

717
00:57:33,383 --> 00:57:34,616
Seriously, what happened?

718
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:46,428
Um, I think that -- if I'm not
fired already, I quit.

719
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:48,831
No, no -- listen.

720
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:53,902
We're concerned. I'm concerned.
We just want to know --

721
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:58,240
Can we all just please act like
none of this ever happened
ever, please?

722
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:03,312
I have to go.

723
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:16,325
Kirsten?

724
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,327
Come on. open up, I can smell
you!

725
00:58:21,498 --> 00:58:24,867
Okay. I was just kidding. Open
up.

726
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:28,403
Seriously. open up.

727
00:58:28,405 --> 00:58:30,272
You're making me worried and
I'm getting pissed off. okay?

728
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:53,662
(cordless phone ringing)

729
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:06,041
Where is my fucking phone?

730
00:59:09,112 --> 00:59:14,283
Hello?

731
00:59:14,285 --> 00:59:16,084
Kirsten?

732
00:59:16,086 --> 00:59:18,420
Oh. Hi. Aunt Barb.

733
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:20,556
Well. I'm on-line looking at
flights into Lambert. I'll
probably just end up

734
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:24,993
getting a rental car at the
airport. and if you need me to
--

735
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:28,096
No. please, Aunt Barb! Please,
please don't do that.

736
00:59:28,098 --> 00:59:32,100
How do I get a call like that
and not want to come and see
you?

737
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:35,938
There's just really no need for
it.

738
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:38,574
What do I have going on that's
more pressing than being your
Aunt Barb?

739
00:59:38,576 --> 00:59:42,110
I don't know. Stuff?

740
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:45,914
If you weren't okay. you'd let
me know, wouldn't you?

741
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,684
I am one-hundred percent
"okie-dokie." Aunt Barb. Double
pinkie swear.

742
00:59:48,686 --> 00:59:53,488
And if that ever changes.
you'll let me know, right?

743
00:59:53,490 --> 00:59:57,459
I will. I swear.

744
00:59:57,461 --> 01:00:00,829
You know. you were always such
a headstrong and outgoing
child, Kirsten.

745
01:00:00,831 --> 01:00:05,167
But I worry because I just
don't see that outgoing side of
you so much anymore.

746
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:09,304
The headstrong part is still
alive and well!

747
01:00:09,306 --> 01:00:12,708
Doesn't surprise me that your
mom never could keep up with
you.

748
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:16,545
Hey. you remember that time I
took you to that matinee of
"Herbie Goes Bananas"

749
01:00:16,547 --> 01:00:19,915
at the Forum and you were so
determined to go to the
restroom all by yourself.

750
01:00:19,917 --> 01:00:24,586
but then you got locked in the
--

751
01:00:24,588 --> 01:00:26,488
I love you Aunt Barb. but I'm
hanging up on you.

752
01:00:29,092 --> 01:00:35,731
Jesus.

753
01:00:37,433 --> 01:00:38,867
Still. you've got to admit --

754
01:00:38,869 --> 01:00:41,303
-- it makes for a really funny
story.

755
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,138
Fuck off!

756
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:45,707
Sorry.

757
01:00:45,709 --> 01:00:46,775
Whatever.

758
01:00:46,777 --> 01:00:51,313
I just came by to see if I
could borrow your internet. I
have to send an email.

759
01:00:51,315 --> 01:00:54,383
Sure. Beth's hanging out over
there if you want to stop by.

760
01:00:54,385 --> 01:00:55,050
Thanks.

761
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,095
Hey.

762
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,367
I don't mean to interrupt --

763
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:14,803
-- and I know it's none of my
business --

764
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:22,644
-- but I just thought I would
say --

765
01:01:22,646 --> 01:01:25,947
-- I've done some stupid stuff.
too, you know.

766
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,254
Excuse me?

767
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:35,657
I don't mean it like that.

768
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:37,826
I really don't. I just --

769
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,265
-- I've been through some
pretty serious shit in my life.
too.

770
01:01:43,267 --> 01:01:48,036
The kind of stuff you don't
always feel

771
01:01:48,038 --> 01:01:49,638
like sharing over polite dinner
conversation.

772
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:53,642
If you get my drift.

773
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,380
So. I just thought I would let
you know that

774
01:01:58,382 --> 01:02:02,217
if you ever get to a point
where you feel like you've lost
control --

775
01:02:02,219 --> 01:02:06,388
I'll let you know.

776
01:02:09,292 --> 01:02:14,563
You got it.

777
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:21,136
"You're listening to 89.5 KOPN
in Columbia. Missouri."

778
01:02:21,138 --> 01:02:24,940
"The show tonight is Women's
Issues. Women's Voices

779
01:02:24,942 --> 01:02:27,476
and I'm your host Corri Flaker."

780
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:29,778
We have a special guest on
tonight.

781
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,813
Her name is Lynn Marie and
she's from New Franklin.

782
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:34,716
Say hi. Lynn!

783
01:02:34,718 --> 01:02:36,618
Hi!

784
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:37,719
I was just thinking that. since
it's your first show,

785
01:02:37,721 --> 01:02:39,387
what do you want to talk about?

786
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:41,323
Okay. First of all. Corri, I
guess I just want to thank you
for

787
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:46,895
giving me an opportunity to
intern here and be a part of
this station

788
01:02:46,897 --> 01:02:51,666
because I think it's a really
special place.

789
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:55,871
In my life. you know I'm from
New Franklin

790
01:02:55,873 --> 01:02:59,775
and I spent a lot of my life in
a pretty dark place.

791
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:03,879
and just sort of feeling stuck.
and judging myself --

792
01:03:03,881 --> 01:03:09,217
-- and just recently. I don't
know, something just changed,

793
01:03:09,219 --> 01:03:13,155
and I've been able to embrace
the positivity.

794
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:15,891
And since I've done that. I've
started interning here, you
know,

795
01:03:15,893 --> 01:03:19,995
I started doing ecstatic dance.
which is just a conduit

796
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:24,299
to become more positive and
more aware. and --

797
01:03:24,301 --> 01:03:27,302
-- I just ramble. sorry!

798
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:30,705
But I guess. yeah, I like
positivity. That's what I'd
like to talk about.

799
01:03:46,455 --> 01:03:48,123
You know. thank you so much for
getting back to me,

800
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:50,792
that was really incredibly cool
of you.

801
01:03:50,794 --> 01:03:53,295
Hey. no problem.

802
01:03:53,297 --> 01:03:55,730
So what's up?

803
01:03:55,732 --> 01:03:57,899
I'm sure you probably inferred
this from the email that I sent
you. but --

804
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:00,802
-- I would really love to help
you guys out on your tour.

805
01:04:04,373 --> 01:04:06,441
I mean. if you'd have me.

806
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:07,609
I personally am not a fan of
last-minute additions to the
tour staff.

807
01:04:07,611 --> 01:04:12,047
It's pretty cramped in the van
already.

808
01:04:12,049 --> 01:04:15,383
Yeah. Right.

809
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,384
Listen. don't get me wrong, you
seem like a nice person and
everything --

810
01:04:16,386 --> 01:04:20,021
Here's what I was thinking.
right?

811
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,858
You know. you guys are kicking
your tour off in Chicago, right?

812
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,594
Right.

813
01:04:25,596 --> 01:04:27,562
Okay. So. what if I meet you
guys in Chicago and,

814
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:31,600
you know what. I just keep an
eye on your CDs and T-shirts
and stuff

815
01:04:31,602 --> 01:04:35,804
and make sure nobody runs off
with them. and then --

816
01:04:35,806 --> 01:04:38,573
you know. I could help schlep
gear and stuff to your van, and
--

817
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:43,311
as long as maybe I'm not a
total pain in the ass.

818
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,981
I could graduate to some
ride-along detail.

819
01:04:45,983 --> 01:04:48,650
I mean. you know -- I'm also
really flexible,

820
01:04:48,652 --> 01:04:51,987
I could probably try to get
rides to the next show.

821
01:04:51,989 --> 01:04:54,256
I'm a resourceful girl!

822
01:04:54,258 --> 01:04:56,191
I mean. if you want to help out
at the show in Chicago,

823
01:04:56,193 --> 01:04:58,927
I'm not going to tell you "no."

824
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:00,795
Even that. You have no idea
what this would mean to me.

825
01:05:00,797 --> 01:05:04,633
Yeah. I don't want to speak for
the other guys, but --

826
01:05:04,635 --> 01:05:07,302
if you cart as much gear as
everybody else.

827
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:09,371
I'm sure they'll be cool with
it.

828
01:05:09,373 --> 01:05:11,206
Yeah. you can count on me for
that. You know, I'm good.

829
01:05:11,208 --> 01:05:15,744
Then. that's awesome!

830
01:05:15,746 --> 01:05:17,979
Um. give me a call if you need
to check in, otherwise --

831
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:21,816
-- I'll see you next week?

832
01:05:21,818 --> 01:05:23,852
Totally. See you then!

833
01:05:23,854 --> 01:05:25,620
All right. I'll see you later.

834
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:34,296
Okay. so what's the address
again?

835
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:42,037
It's "mike4204ever" at
bluntster dot com.

836
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:50,178
B-L-U-N-T-S-T-E-R dot com. Got
it.

837
01:05:51,914 --> 01:05:57,552
So I will email you from the
road and let you know how
things are going.

838
01:05:57,554 --> 01:05:59,321
Sure thing.

839
01:05:59,323 --> 01:06:01,856
Okay.

840
01:06:01,858 --> 01:06:03,224
And. uh, thanks for letting me
store my vinyl at your place.

841
01:06:03,226 --> 01:06:05,660
No sweat. You could say it's a
--

842
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:08,596
mutually beneficial arrangement.

843
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:12,367
All right. wish me luck!

844
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:14,502
Bye!

845
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:24,679
Nice!

846
01:06:25,982 --> 01:06:28,249
Amazing!

847
01:06:28,251 --> 01:06:29,818
I know!

848
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:33,221
Lynn. I can't thank you enough
for this.

849
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:35,223
You would not believe the
amount of convincing I had to do

850
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:38,994
to get Todd to sign off on this.

851
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,429
Count me as grateful and
appreciative.

852
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,200
Todd. right?

853
01:06:47,036 --> 01:06:48,670
At least something good came of
all this.

854
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:50,605
Shotgun!

855
01:06:52,608 --> 01:06:57,512
Later later. Columbia! Road
trip!

856
01:07:42,124 --> 01:07:47,829
Mom.

857
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:49,164
Honey! Hey!

858
01:07:50,900 --> 01:08:01,076
It's good to see you.

859
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:03,645
What took you so long?

860
01:08:03,647 --> 01:08:05,447
Well. that's a complicated
question.

861
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,417
Honey. I'm sorry. It doesn't
matter. Really.

862
01:08:13,722 --> 01:08:16,825
So Aunt Barb told me that
you're living in Cedar Rapids.

863
01:08:16,827 --> 01:08:20,962
How long has that been?

864
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:22,931
Almost four years. Can you
believe it?

865
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:25,900
Yeah. I can. It's been a long
time. Except that --

866
01:08:33,075 --> 01:08:34,075
Time passes so quickly. right?

867
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:43,251
Well. I'm having a glass of the
shiraz. How about you?

868
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:47,689
I can't even remember the last
time I had a drink before
sundown.

869
01:08:47,691 --> 01:08:51,493
Oh. Kirsten, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to put you on the
spot or anything.

870
01:08:51,495 --> 01:08:54,629
No. mom, it's fine.

871
01:08:54,631 --> 01:08:56,631
Sounds good. I'll have one too.

872
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:00,135
Hey ladies.

873
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:02,237
Hi.

874
01:09:02,239 --> 01:09:03,738
Can I start you off with
something to drink?

875
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:04,472
Yes. we're going to have two
glasses of the shiraz, please.

876
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,006
Okay. I'll be right back.

877
01:09:05,008 --> 01:09:06,141
Thank you.

878
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,678
So Aunt Barb tells me that
you're back in Columbia

879
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:14,782
and you're working with some
local record label?

880
01:09:14,784 --> 01:09:16,417
Aunt Barb sure does love to
talk!

881
01:09:16,419 --> 01:09:19,187
Yeah!

882
01:09:19,189 --> 01:09:23,858
Yeah. I just started out as a
filing clerk, and then --

883
01:09:26,562 --> 01:09:27,328
I was managing the on-line
division. and then --

884
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:31,499
I was balancing the books. And
then --

885
01:09:34,837 --> 01:09:36,204
Yeah?

886
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:41,209
Well. now -- I'm the vice
president of business affairs.

887
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:44,512
Wow. Really? Well well!

888
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:47,182
It's a vanity title.

889
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:51,853
Hey. you were never one to
promote your achievements.
Bully for you!

890
01:09:55,090 --> 01:10:03,398
So. uh -- what's the label
called?

891
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,099
Emergency Umbrella.

892
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:07,435
Well. that's a peculiar name.

893
01:10:10,139 --> 01:10:10,972
But. it doesn't matter.

894
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:15,109
Kirsten ...

895
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:16,144
... I'm really proud of you.

896
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:23,117
Are there any bands on the
label that I might have heard
about?

897
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:28,623
Bald Eagle?

898
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:35,196
No.

899
01:10:35,198 --> 01:10:35,997
Just goes to show you how out
of touch your mom is.

900
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:48,676
Gosh. I wonder where our drinks
are.

901
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:56,451
Kirsten.

902
01:10:56,453 --> 01:10:57,552
Hey. Kirsten!

903
01:10:59,622 --> 01:11:01,289
Kirsten!

904
01:11:01,291 --> 01:11:02,857
I didn't want you to miss this.

905
01:11:17,973 --> 01:11:23,945
"Quel tableau. n'est-ce pas?"

906
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:27,982
"Mais oui."
