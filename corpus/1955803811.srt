00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:25,000
I said to Batroc...

3
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,730
If we want to make S.H.i.E.L.D. pay us...

4
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,100
We have to start sending them
bodies now!

5
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,980
I have a bullet for someone...

6
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,250
You want a bullet in your head?

7
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:37,020
Move that foot.
You want a bullet in the head...?

8
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:49,060
I don't like waiting.

9
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,190
Call Durand.

10
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,560
I want this ship ready to move
when the ransom comes.

11
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,280
Start the engines.

12
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,730
Okay.

13
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,970
Shut up.

14
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,430
You want to be a hero?
Is that it?

15
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:40,170
All right, I've waited long onough...

16
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,920
Hey!

17
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,990
Find Batroc...

18
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,090
If I don't hear anything in two minutes...

19
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,280
...I'll start killing them!

20
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,560
I'll find him.

21
00:08:58,670 --> 00:08:59,460
Two minutes.

22
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,190
Radio silence
from S.H.i.E.L.D., Batroc...

23
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,310
Time is up.

24
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,240
Who wants to dies first...?

25
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,880
You!

26
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:20,950
Get that one.

27
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,200
The line just went dead.

28
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:45,070
I've lost contact with them...

29
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,430
I thought you were
more than just a shield...

30
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,150
Let's see.
