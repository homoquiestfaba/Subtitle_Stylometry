1
00:01:38,698 --> 00:01:43,502
<i>As life progresses, images blur.</i>

2
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:48,974
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

3
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:54,012
<i>Some of them true,</i>

4
00:01:54,014 --> 00:01:55,547
<i>some of them false.</i>

5
00:01:57,417 --> 00:01:59,284
<i>I remember her well.</i>

6
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,187
<i>At least I think I do.</i>

7
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,756
<i>She was a warrior.</i>

8
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,927
<i>In the old century
you had to be,</i>

9
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,696
<i>in order to survive.</i>

10
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,593
Breathe in and out,
the way she does.

11
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:45,631
And now, push. Now!

12
00:02:59,212 --> 00:03:00,746
Thank you so much.

13
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:03,682
Bye.

14
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:07,619
See you in a couple
of days, right?

15
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:22,801
Mama...

16
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,903
Are you coming?

17
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,345
- Good morning!
- Hi, Liz!

18
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,391
Here.

19
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,395
Liz, the boy's gotta learn
how to shoot.

20
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:26,198
Well, he's gonna do it anyway.

21
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,767
Better here than sneaking
off somewhere else.

22
00:04:34,073 --> 00:04:36,775
You're scaring your mother.
She ain't my mother.

23
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:41,740
Beware of false prophets,

24
00:05:41,742 --> 00:05:45,377
who come to you
in sheep's clothing...

25
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:50,382
For inwardly,
they are ravening wolves.

26
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:53,952
Jesus is the Shepherd
who protects you

27
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:56,521
and your family
from those wolves.

28
00:05:57,256 --> 00:06:01,193
And I am his dog.

29
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,329
The sheepdog that gets
the lambs back on track

30
00:06:04,331 --> 00:06:06,064
when they stray off the path.

31
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:12,104
And some of you
have strayed, haven't you?

32
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,576
What do you people think?

33
00:06:17,578 --> 00:06:19,978
That god is well disposed
towards you?

34
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:23,815
Let me set things straight.

35
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:26,918
Those who deserve it,
go to hell.

36
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,455
I could tell you about hell.

37
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:33,558
About its flames.

38
00:06:34,327 --> 00:06:37,129
About the pain.

39
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:40,699
I'm sure you people have tried
to imagine what it's like.

40
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,036
It's worse.

41
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,974
Retribution is coming.

42
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:54,579
Now, let us join in singing.

43
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:57,582
<i>Abide with me.</i>

44
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,806
You all right?

45
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:28,280
Thank you.

46
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,338
How're you doing, sir?
This is my daughter, Sam.

47
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,741
My boy, Matthew.
And, uh...

48
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,177
My wife.

49
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,749
Where were you?

50
00:08:12,592 --> 00:08:14,726
That man is a stranger here,

51
00:08:14,728 --> 00:08:16,495
he doesn't know anybody yet.

52
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:19,397
I'd have expected a little
more compassion from you.

53
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:22,400
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

54
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:24,002
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

55
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,687
Just breathe, all right?

56
00:08:42,689 --> 00:08:44,556
Breathe, just breathe.

57
00:08:44,558 --> 00:08:48,527
- Everybody outside.
- We don't need no busybodies.

58
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,762
Go on, get. Get out!

59
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,868
Nathan, I think you better
go outside too.

60
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,671
Some things aren't meant
for a man's eyes.

61
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,975
It's gonna be just fine,
right, Liz?

62
00:09:05,845 --> 00:09:08,046
You're gonna
take care of her, right?

63
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:09,147
Promise?

64
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:15,020
I'm going to be right outside, okay?
I love you. I love you.

65
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,624
You take care of her.

66
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,961
Close the door behind you.

67
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,854
It's gonna be all right, honey.

68
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:04,302
The baby's head is too big.

69
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:06,705
What's that supposed to say?

70
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,641
We're going to have to choose
between the baby and the mother.

71
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,477
Can't save both of them.

72
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,479
You have to.

73
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:17,315
Your mother said everything
would be all right.

74
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,791
No, I wanna stay.
I wanna help.

75
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:39,838
Hey... how's it
going in there?

76
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,374
Everything all right?

77
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,076
Yeah?

78
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:11,136
Push, Abby. Hard as
you can now, come on!

79
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,982
Good girl!

80
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,991
Where's the baby?

81
00:11:32,993 --> 00:11:36,061
I wanna see my baby.
Where is he?

82
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,697
Give me my baby!

83
00:12:40,326 --> 00:12:41,426
It ain't your fault.

84
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:48,199
The lord gives
and the lord takes away.

85
00:12:56,709 --> 00:12:58,042
The reverend?

86
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,212
Liz...

87
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,382
The reverend is a man of god.

88
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:08,953
You're seeing things
that ain't there.

89
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,312
<i>If Jesus came back to
life after he was dead...</i>

90
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:38,249
Couldn't that happen
to Abigail's baby, too?

91
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:46,558
Can you face-paint me?

92
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,240
I'm doing something.
Can't you tell?

93
00:15:03,602 --> 00:15:05,870
We've come to see
if everything's all right.

94
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:07,338
Everything's just fine.

95
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,374
No reason for you folks
to go wasting your time.

96
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,878
We'd like to look for ourselves.

97
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,348
Rather not. There's a
doctor coming in an hour,

98
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,050
it's better if he takes a look.

99
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:23,121
The reverend arranged it.

100
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:41,105
Hello!

101
00:16:19,278 --> 00:16:21,212
- What the hell?
- Liz!

102
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,151
Liz!

103
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,489
You get down here, Liz!

104
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,425
You get down here!

105
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,130
I wanna see your face.

106
00:16:41,634 --> 00:16:45,169
I wanna see your face.

107
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:02,487
Nathan! Don't take it out
on my boy!

108
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:06,290
We can talk about this
like decent folk!

109
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,593
I got no quarrel with you, Eli!

110
00:17:09,928 --> 00:17:11,529
I'm here for your wife.

111
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,099
She's gotta be punished
for her sins.

112
00:17:16,168 --> 00:17:18,369
She's gotta burn
at the stake, Eli!

113
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:21,105
Try to be reasonable
now, Nathan.

114
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,941
I know your sorrow, believe me.

115
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:26,677
I lost a loved one too,
remember?

116
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:29,047
I know you're out of
your mind with grief,

117
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:34,085
but believe me, your pain will
pass, just like mine did!

118
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:37,021
I could accept that real easy,

119
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,092
as long as that tongueless
murderess ends up at the stake!

120
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:44,362
I demand retribution!

121
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,600
You know what she did, Eli?

122
00:17:52,271 --> 00:17:54,539
She murdered my baby boy.

123
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:59,677
Before he could even be
baptized, she murdered him.

124
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,618
What's gonna happen to him now?

125
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,291
Do you think
he's gonna find salvation?

126
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,398
You know how she did it, Eli?

127
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:24,602
I seen him.

128
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,108
His brains had leaked out.

129
00:18:34,513 --> 00:18:36,514
Your wife broke his skull.

130
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,553
She cracked his skull wide open!

131
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:44,989
She should go to hell for this!

132
00:18:47,392 --> 00:18:49,160
That will be enough.

133
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,330
There has been suffering...

134
00:18:53,432 --> 00:18:56,067
It is the whiskey talking now.

135
00:18:56,069 --> 00:18:58,202
This is not the moment
to solve this.

136
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:02,640
She belongs in hell, reverend.

137
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,340
Did he do you any harm?

138
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,380
He just helped us
out of a real fix.

139
00:20:16,415 --> 00:20:18,282
Do I get one, too?

140
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,518
You ain't old enough
for that yet.

141
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,653
Why be so hard on the boy?

142
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,722
He only acted
to protect his family.

143
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,058
That makes him an adult.

144
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,061
His mother doesn't want
him playing with guns.

145
00:20:30,063 --> 00:20:34,298
It's natural for a young man to
want to hold a rifle in his hands.

146
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,801
May I offer my glass to Matthew?

147
00:20:52,718 --> 00:20:55,019
I think it's about time you
went back to bed, Matthew.

148
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:57,955
- Aw, dad!
- Come on, drink up.

149
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:16,874
None of this would have happened

150
00:21:16,876 --> 00:21:19,310
if that baby had been born
in perfect health.

151
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:24,582
But Liz couldn't do
nothing about that.

152
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:27,918
She decided who was to live
and who was to die.

153
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:31,589
That decision belongs
to god, and god only.

154
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:35,459
Why did she not leave
that choice up to him?

155
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,533
Maybe I should go fetch her.

156
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,412
I know you're there,

157
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,881
and I know you can hear me.

158
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,720
You may have no tongue,

159
00:22:35,722 --> 00:22:37,855
but there is nothing wrong
with your ears.

160
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,129
Why do doubts rise
in your heart?

161
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,400
Why are you troubled?

162
00:22:53,004 --> 00:22:54,972
How do you sleep at night?

163
00:22:57,509 --> 00:23:00,444
How does it feel to be
a murderess?

164
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:14,492
Do you know why I'm here?

165
00:23:17,028 --> 00:23:18,562
I'm here to punish you.

166
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,634
Do you love this family?

167
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,839
I've looked at your daughter.

168
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:33,077
She's almost
a young woman already.

169
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,717
There you are.

170
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,488
I must be going.

171
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:48,793
Please don't bear a grudge
against Nathan in your heart.

172
00:23:48,795 --> 00:23:51,896
Losing a child is the worst
thing a body can go through.

173
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,434
I was just talking to your
wife about that same thing.

174
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,730
You didn't even thank him.

175
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:30,935
Fact is, you didn't even
say hello to him.

176
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,943
Liz, Nathan will come around.

177
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,520
Right, you know what?

178
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,424
Give me a couple of days.

179
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,192
I'll get someone
to come in for the sheep...

180
00:24:56,795 --> 00:24:58,829
And then we'll go up
to my pa's for a bit.

181
00:25:00,732 --> 00:25:02,766
He's all alone up there anyway.

182
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Dad?

183
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,271
Dad?

184
00:26:55,213 --> 00:26:58,682
I'm just going to talk.
This has got to stop.

185
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:01,552
First shootin' our
windows up, now this.

186
00:27:01,554 --> 00:27:03,687
Yah! Come on!

187
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:07,791
Yah! Yah!

188
00:27:12,263 --> 00:27:14,264
I want you
to stay with your mother.

189
00:27:14,266 --> 00:27:15,532
She ain't my mother.

190
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:18,035
Matthew!
You're gonna need my help.

191
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,640
All right, as long
as you stay outside.

192
00:27:26,845 --> 00:27:29,013
But why can't
i just play inside?

193
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:32,049
Why?

194
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:35,252
And why can't I help out?

195
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:55,232
I think we can take that
blindfold off, now.

196
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,934
But I promised.

197
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,335
Your mother won't mind.

198
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,771
She has a lot to do.

199
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:06,310
Here, see?

200
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:09,880
Everything will be fine.

201
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:13,517
And mama?

202
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:15,552
She had to work in the barn.

203
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:19,323
And she did not want you
there, do you remember?

204
00:29:22,961 --> 00:29:25,295
I would like to talk
to you about your mother.

205
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,060
Nathan!

206
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:41,004
They've gone and moved.

207
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,752
Liz?

208
00:30:55,754 --> 00:30:57,120
Where are you?

209
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:11,869
No, no, Nathan's gone.
And Abigail.

210
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,370
Packed up, moved out.

211
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,459
Oh! Where'd you
get to, huh?

212
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,462
You scared your mother.

213
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:40,731
Had her worried sick.

214
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,067
Mama, are you evil?

215
00:32:19,504 --> 00:32:21,939
The reverend said
you murdered a man.

216
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,243
He says he's here to punish you.

217
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:28,412
To take you back
where he came from.

218
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,556
Why?

219
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,293
Because she loves you.

220
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:55,899
Shoot me.

221
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,869
Behind you.

222
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,680
Please.

223
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,783
Stop the pain.

224
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,171
Take them to grandpa.

225
00:40:55,686 --> 00:40:58,721
Mama? Mama?

226
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:10,533
It was the reverend.
He woke me up.

227
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,545
Yah! Yah!

228
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:08,044
Joanna. My name is Joanna.

229
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:51,854
Frank!

230
00:44:53,057 --> 00:44:54,190
Frank!

231
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,993
Meng!

232
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:21,851
Meng, you prosperous fucker,
you. Look at you.

233
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:23,853
And what do we have here?

234
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,155
My name's Joanna.

235
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:28,691
Well, it is a pleasure
to meet you.

236
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:32,028
Come on now, spin around,
let me get a look at you.

237
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,797
There you are.

238
00:45:34,799 --> 00:45:36,999
- Sally!
- Yeah.

239
00:45:37,001 --> 00:45:39,168
Would you be so kind
as to treat Joanna here

240
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:42,138
to a glass of cold lemonade?

241
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,307
Yeah, but of course.
Come, honey.

242
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:50,379
All right, meng,
let's talk fucking Turkey.

243
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,052
Here you go.

244
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,660
Lookie here! Fresh meat.

245
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:06,429
Swallow it right
on down, girlie.

246
00:46:06,431 --> 00:46:08,865
Soon you'll be swallowing
something else.

247
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:11,968
What's your name, girl?
Joanna.

248
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,903
Did your daddy bring you here?

249
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,973
No? Are you sure?

250
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:18,574
Didn't he just think
you were so good,

251
00:46:18,576 --> 00:46:21,177
he had to let the rest
of the world in on it, too?

252
00:46:31,688 --> 00:46:33,489
Hyah! Hyah!

253
00:46:37,828 --> 00:46:40,096
Whoa, there now, where
do you think you're going?

254
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,564
They're leaving without me!

255
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,399
Yes, they are, but don't
you worry about a thing

256
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,536
'cause from now on, this is
where you live, darling.

257
00:46:47,571 --> 00:46:48,871
Right here.

258
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:57,513
Now, come on now.
Let's get you cleaned up.

259
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,205
Yes.

260
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:42,825
Shh, shh.

261
00:47:51,635 --> 00:47:54,070
Yeah, yeah!

262
00:47:54,072 --> 00:47:55,905
So that's the work
we do around here.

263
00:47:55,907 --> 00:47:57,206
And we do all the moaning
and groaning

264
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:59,909
because that makes sure
it's over faster.

265
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:03,312
Why?
Why? That's what men like.

266
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:10,887
So, um...
You ever bled yet?

267
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:15,358
'Twixt your legs, honey.

268
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,928
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
You have, haven't you?

269
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:24,967
Yeah? Well, then, that's
gonna be our little secret

270
00:48:24,969 --> 00:48:26,469
for the time being, okay?

271
00:48:27,804 --> 00:48:29,171
Now, you go to bed.

272
00:49:07,878 --> 00:49:09,345
And who are you?

273
00:49:10,514 --> 00:49:12,081
What's your name, girl?

274
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:14,283
Joanna.

275
00:49:16,553 --> 00:49:19,989
Frank, what's it cost to go
upstairs with this one?

276
00:49:19,991 --> 00:49:22,858
Come on now, Fred,
you cannot afford her.

277
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,193
Oh, I don't know about that.

278
00:49:24,195 --> 00:49:26,495
I got pretty damn lucky
at cards today.

279
00:49:26,497 --> 00:49:28,397
Hey, eastman.

280
00:49:28,399 --> 00:49:31,634
I'm horny as hell
and I feel like doing you!

281
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,936
What would you say
to a free ride, huh?

282
00:49:33,938 --> 00:49:36,272
That ain't yours to decide.

283
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,740
I'll pay for it myself.

284
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,176
Damn, Sally, what, you been
holding out on me now, huh?

285
00:49:40,178 --> 00:49:44,080
I'll go along with that.
But then she gets to watch.

286
00:49:44,082 --> 00:49:46,315
No way.
Then, it's no deal.

287
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:50,086
Oh, it sounds like
a fine idea to me.

288
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:52,688
It'll be most educational,
I'm sure.

289
00:50:06,203 --> 00:50:09,472
What's wrong, don't you
like it, honeybunch?

290
00:50:16,646 --> 00:50:17,747
Oh, yeah.

291
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,050
Hit me.

292
00:50:21,052 --> 00:50:23,152
- What?
- Hit me!

293
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:24,687
No, I ain't gonna do that.

294
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:26,422
Hit me, god damn it!

295
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,293
I'm not taking this, eastman.

296
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:33,329
Hit me again.

297
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:36,732
Hit me again!

298
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:44,473
No, no, no, no, don't shoot!

299
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,877
Don't shoot.
I don't mind it, Joanna.

300
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,145
It's just a game, right?

301
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:54,083
You do that again
and I'm going to shoot.

302
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,218
Please put the gun down.

303
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:59,488
Don't you ever.
Just keep pointing it at me.

304
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,162
Don't you dare drop
that gun on me.

305
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:13,302
That's right.
Keep pointing it at me.

306
00:51:13,970 --> 00:51:16,338
Don't you dare.

307
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,675
I'm gonna strangle
the life out of her!

308
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:25,781
Shoot me!

309
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:32,321
Do it, Joanna.
Shoot me, god damn it!

310
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:38,360
Shoot, god damn it, bitch!

311
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:01,684
You're gonna make a fine little
whore, i can see that already.

312
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,590
I just bet that you can make
me real nice and clean too.

313
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:24,707
The whole world may see
our fair city of bismuth

314
00:52:24,709 --> 00:52:27,376
as a place
of sodom and gomorrah,

315
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,247
but rules do apply here.

316
00:52:31,249 --> 00:52:36,752
A whore cannot be allowed to shoot
down her customers with impunity.

317
00:52:36,754 --> 00:52:39,088
My brother runs
the inferno as a place

318
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:40,723
where hard-working miners

319
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:43,225
can find well-deserved
recreation.

320
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,961
That must remain so,

321
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:47,396
and so it will.

322
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,746
Let this be an example.

323
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:33,976
Come on now...

324
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:36,478
A mining town has a need
for organized entertainment.

325
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:43,986
And I need to know that
customers here feel safe.

326
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:47,389
That's why I brought
my brother Zeke to bismuth.

327
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,925
He's a better sheriff
than this town deserves.

328
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,262
Everybody at the inferno knows

329
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,898
that if a girl so much
as scratches a customer

330
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,466
she's gonna be punished.

331
00:53:58,602 --> 00:54:00,803
So Sally knew
what she had coming.

332
00:54:01,938 --> 00:54:03,572
But he strangled her.

333
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:09,812
Yeah... I know,
it hurt me too.

334
00:54:09,814 --> 00:54:12,615
Damn, she was
one of my oldest employees.

335
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:16,585
But rules are rules.

336
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,554
If you don't obey the rules,
you're guilty.

337
00:54:18,556 --> 00:54:20,923
And if you're guilty,
you're gonna pay.

338
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,262
You understand that,
don't you? Hmm?

339
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:28,964
Tell me you understand.

340
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:44,380
You know how old i was when I
first went to bed with a girl?

341
00:54:47,917 --> 00:54:49,451
I was 21.

342
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,488
Twenty-one.

343
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:55,658
While Zeke, he was 14.

344
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,361
I got to watch, though.

345
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:01,764
I spied on him
through the peephole.

346
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:09,905
I never did see
what all the fuss was about.

347
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,408
You know, what everybody
talked about.

348
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:15,010
I couldn't see it.

349
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:20,482
You're not a child anymore.

350
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:26,722
I haven't been for a long time.

351
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,670
The time has come.

352
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,909
I'm gonna be gentle.

353
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,099
That's right.

354
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,203
Oh, stud, you sure are good.

355
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:15,270
Joanna!

356
00:56:15,272 --> 00:56:17,139
Joanna!

357
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:18,607
Frank is in a gunfight!

358
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,876
Hey, what the hell!
I'm almost done.

359
00:56:27,485 --> 00:56:29,218
You see that?

360
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:31,553
What do you say we have
her join us next time?

361
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:49,538
This is just between
me and frank.

362
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,575
All I want is a fair fight.

363
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,244
Then what are you doing here?

364
00:56:56,914 --> 00:56:58,347
Blow him to hell!

365
00:56:58,349 --> 00:56:59,748
Yeah!

366
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,583
I'm not a violent man.

367
00:57:02,318 --> 00:57:03,986
I usually work with numbers.

368
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,590
But now, I'm standing
here in front of you

369
00:57:08,592 --> 00:57:10,125
to shoot you dead, frank.

370
00:57:11,461 --> 00:57:14,463
My daughter is dead
because of you.

371
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:20,169
It's men like you who think their
actions have no consequences,

372
00:57:20,171 --> 00:57:23,172
who are making the country turn
into what it's turning into.

373
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,643
So, for my daughter's sake,

374
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:30,612
for every daughter's sake,

375
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:33,615
I have to kill you.

376
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,984
Because I am a father.

377
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,588
So you can count.

378
00:57:40,824 --> 00:57:43,759
And you can sure as shit talk.

379
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,761
But what we all wanna know is,

380
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,096
can you shoot?

381
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:15,190
So, when do we elope?

382
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,594
Where to?

383
00:58:20,063 --> 00:58:21,797
Anywhere.

384
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,699
Wherever we can be free.

385
00:58:25,568 --> 00:58:28,003
But we are free here.
Sort of.

386
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:30,839
No, we're not.

387
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:32,875
And you know it.

388
00:58:36,546 --> 00:58:38,046
Face-paint me.

389
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:41,083
What?

390
00:58:41,085 --> 00:58:43,719
Paint my face with your fingers.

391
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,607
You, uh, remind me of my wife.

392
00:59:05,609 --> 00:59:08,710
But you dress better, you smell
better, you look better.

393
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,779
Thank you.

394
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:18,854
No fucking kissing.

395
00:59:19,455 --> 00:59:21,290
I said, no kissing!

396
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,329
No kissing!
God damn it!

397
00:59:27,331 --> 00:59:29,464
So, are you gonna buy me
that drink, or what?

398
00:59:29,466 --> 00:59:31,700
Sure. Whiskey.

399
00:59:40,843 --> 00:59:42,911
I warned you,
you son of a bitch!

400
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,547
Nobody kisses me,
do you understand?

401
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,616
Fucking whore,
you bit my tongue off.

402
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:50,018
Frank? Frank?

403
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:52,754
Oh, girl, you really
gone and done it now.

404
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:54,656
I warned him six times!

405
00:59:54,658 --> 00:59:58,360
Well, the fella you warned is kind
of important up at the gold mine.

406
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,230
Now, I got me a whole saloon

407
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:05,167
full of drunken fucking idiots
all howling for retribution.

408
01:00:05,169 --> 01:00:06,768
Tell 'em to go fuck themselves.

409
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,303
Give them a drink
on the house or something.

410
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:10,005
Well, you think I'm gonna
waste my hard-earned money

411
01:00:10,007 --> 01:00:13,008
because you girls refuse
to obey the fucking rules?

412
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,043
Get the fuck up! Come on!

413
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,413
Get out there!
Fuck you!

414
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,316
Now, where's Mike?

415
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,453
I demand retribution!

416
01:00:24,455 --> 01:00:26,321
You're gonna get it, Mike.

417
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:29,224
You see, the rules
in bismuth are clear,

418
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:32,561
and all customers will get
the respect they got coming.

419
01:00:32,563 --> 01:00:34,796
Hang the stupid whore!

420
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:38,100
No, no, Elizabeth here,
she's not gonna hang.

421
01:00:38,102 --> 01:00:39,735
Gotta hang her, frank!

422
01:00:39,737 --> 01:00:42,504
Mike ain't dead now
neither, is he?

423
01:00:42,506 --> 01:00:46,008
But he was a victim
of her lawlessness,

424
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:49,311
so he gets to make
a fucking proposal.

425
01:00:49,313 --> 01:00:51,880
Now what's it gonna
be, Mike? Huh?

426
01:00:51,882 --> 01:00:54,783
You want this free pussy
for a week? Is that it?

427
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,155
You cut that fucking
bitch's tongue off!

428
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:07,996
You want a trade, Mike, huh?

429
01:01:07,998 --> 01:01:10,465
You want an eye for an eye?
Is that what you want, Mike?

430
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:29,117
Rinse it five times
a day with alcohol

431
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,153
and it should heal up
sooner than you'd think.

432
01:01:31,921 --> 01:01:34,022
No solid foods.
No blow jobs.

433
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,924
Will she ever be able
to talk again?

434
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:37,859
Not much chance of that.

435
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:39,428
Here you go.

436
01:01:41,964 --> 01:01:43,031
Goodbye.

437
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:48,704
I...

438
01:01:49,505 --> 01:01:50,772
Dance...

439
01:01:51,741 --> 01:01:53,608
On Tuesday?

440
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:57,312
I only drink

441
01:01:58,481 --> 01:01:59,915
on Tuesdays.

442
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,450
I only drink on Tuesdays.

443
01:02:05,455 --> 01:02:06,755
I...

444
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,125
Kill...

445
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,728
Frank?

446
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:15,797
That's suicide.

447
01:02:19,502 --> 01:02:21,636
But they'll come after you.

448
01:02:21,638 --> 01:02:22,738
Besides, what're you gonna do?

449
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:24,172
Work in some other cathouse?

450
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:29,311
Please don't do it.

451
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:32,080
I couldn't stand to miss you.

452
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,459
Don't think

453
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:48,430
just because this is a
lawless, godless place

454
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:52,000
that your actions will go
without consequences.

455
01:02:54,737 --> 01:02:58,073
Ladies, do you want
to end up in hell?

456
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:02,310
The nice clothing
doesn't fool anybody.

457
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:05,647
I know who you are

458
01:03:05,649 --> 01:03:07,215
and I know what you are.

459
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,087
What would your fathers
think if they knew?

460
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,390
Your mothers weep.

461
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:21,096
Your fathers pluck out
their eyes in shame!

462
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,812
I've managed to find
someone who doesn't mind

463
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:38,413
marrying a woman
without a tongue,

464
01:03:38,415 --> 01:03:40,215
but it will take some traveling.

465
01:03:41,617 --> 01:03:44,219
He's been a widower
since the last six months.

466
01:03:44,221 --> 01:03:46,254
He's looking for a wife
who can cook

467
01:03:46,256 --> 01:03:49,124
and who doesn't mind
that he already has a son.

468
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:53,395
No, I figured as much.

469
01:03:58,334 --> 01:04:00,168
"We will welcome you
with open arms

470
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:02,470
"and make sure you feel right at
home, as quickly as possible.

471
01:04:02,472 --> 01:04:05,874
"Respectfully yours." And so on and
so forth, and there's a picture.

472
01:04:10,012 --> 01:04:11,613
You're gonna have a real family.

473
01:04:17,753 --> 01:04:19,221
How am I gonna do that?

474
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,225
We're sisters?

475
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,385
Frank would kill us.

476
01:04:52,088 --> 01:04:54,189
No, you never know.

477
01:04:54,191 --> 01:04:55,757
And when you've convinced
your new husband,

478
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:57,599
you can pay for the
stagecoach from down there.

479
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:02,564
How long you think you'll need?

480
01:05:06,335 --> 01:05:08,036
You two gotta come right away.

481
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:09,571
Some fella just paid
a whole pile of cash

482
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:12,607
to buy out the inferno.
Get your asses moving.

483
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,346
Your last night
and you got to work too.

484
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,652
All right now, listen up!

485
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:27,022
Usually, we don't earn Jack-shit
at the end of the month.

486
01:05:28,392 --> 01:05:30,358
Jackie, shut the fuck up
right fucking now

487
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,960
or I'm gonna fucking make you.

488
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:35,297
This customer right here
is a godsend

489
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:37,198
and he bought the right
to all of y'all this evening

490
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:39,534
and if he becomes
a regular customer,

491
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:43,972
well, you can all expect a big,
fat, fucking bonus, courtesy of me.

492
01:05:45,074 --> 01:05:47,409
But I demand
total commitment here.

493
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:50,512
I mean, whatever happens,

494
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,715
whatever the fuck he wants,

495
01:05:53,717 --> 01:05:55,317
he is gonna get it.

496
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:00,755
Now if anybody,

497
01:06:00,757 --> 01:06:04,459
I mean, anyone does anything
to ruin it for me...

498
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:10,065
Well, they're gonna be punished.

499
01:06:10,067 --> 01:06:13,568
Shit, they're gonna be punished worse
than I've punished anyone before.

500
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:18,006
But with that fucking said,
you do a good job, and, uh,

501
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,141
shit, he'll take you all.

502
01:06:27,783 --> 01:06:29,150
I want this one.

503
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:54,209
All right now, come on!

504
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,414
You are gonna like this.

505
01:07:00,883 --> 01:07:03,151
That's right, there you are.

506
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:05,186
My little doves.

507
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,994
Now, will you look at that, huh?

508
01:07:12,996 --> 01:07:16,998
These two right here, they're
real young, real fresh.

509
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,700
Untouched, if you know
what I mean.

510
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,636
We got all kinds here.

511
01:07:21,638 --> 01:07:24,439
We've got Chinese, if you
like that kind of thing.

512
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:29,077
Oh, this one here, she's Jackie.

513
01:07:29,079 --> 01:07:31,980
Jackie likes you, i can tell.

514
01:07:31,982 --> 01:07:34,215
We've got anything
you want here.

515
01:07:34,217 --> 01:07:36,785
All your heart's desire.

516
01:07:36,787 --> 01:07:39,587
Right here in the inferno.

517
01:07:39,589 --> 01:07:42,223
Oh, this one here,
well, she got a fire in her.

518
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:44,225
And I had to cut out her tongue

519
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:45,493
just to keep her in line.

520
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:49,230
Good thing, she can't talk back.

521
01:07:56,439 --> 01:08:00,909
Oh, you have fine taste, sir.

522
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:04,412
This one right here, well,
she is a mystery to me.

523
01:08:05,481 --> 01:08:07,982
I bought her from a band
of traveling gypsies.

524
01:08:07,984 --> 01:08:10,085
You know, colorful types.

525
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,121
Uh-huh.

526
01:08:13,123 --> 01:08:15,256
Damn, I don't even know
her real name.

527
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,791
She's the one.

528
01:08:49,793 --> 01:08:52,026
Well, that's an excellent
choice, sir.

529
01:08:52,028 --> 01:08:53,728
May I suggest a couple
of other gi...

530
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:54,796
Only her.

531
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,299
But you paid
for the whole inferno.

532
01:08:58,301 --> 01:09:00,335
I paid not to be seen
doing this.

533
01:09:38,741 --> 01:09:40,742
This evening has cost me
a lot of money.

534
01:09:43,913 --> 01:09:46,915
Is there something wrong with your voice?
Can't you talk?

535
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,350
Yes, I can.

536
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:00,895
Would you like me
to dance for you?

537
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,718
I had to wait
a long time to find you.

538
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:29,290
I am very disappointed. I had
considered many things, but not this.

539
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:35,230
Is this what you wanted?

540
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,465
What you looked for?

541
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,377
I am prepared
to forgive all your sins.

542
01:10:50,212 --> 01:10:52,480
I have also sinned.

543
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:54,682
I am going to burn
in hell forever.

544
01:10:56,285 --> 01:10:58,286
I gave up the right
to go to heaven.

545
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:00,822
But you made me do it.

546
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:04,359
And only you can save me.

547
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:19,140
No.
Yes.

548
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:21,976
I have sinned because we should
have finished the ceremony first.

549
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:24,946
Paul, the apostle, wrote it
in the first corinthians.

550
01:11:24,948 --> 01:11:27,148
Help me, Joanna.
I can't.

551
01:11:27,150 --> 01:11:29,384
Then we shall both burn in hell.

552
01:11:29,386 --> 01:11:31,853
I am here to save you,
so that you can save me.

553
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:37,358
I will make you do it.
You know I will.

554
01:11:37,360 --> 01:11:39,294
I won't let you do that again.

555
01:11:39,296 --> 01:11:40,728
I'll kill you first.

556
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:45,500
I tried.
You leave me no choice.

557
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:50,071
Help! Somebody... ah!

558
01:11:50,073 --> 01:11:51,973
Somebody, help! Ah!

559
01:11:51,975 --> 01:11:54,342
You are mine! It is god's will!
Help!

560
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:57,145
Help!

561
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:59,514
Help! Somebody!

562
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,751
Get out!

563
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:10,358
You whore!

564
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,709
You're coming with me tonight.

565
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,615
I need your help.

566
01:14:16,652 --> 01:14:18,753
You're not gonna get me
into trouble, are you?

567
01:14:55,525 --> 01:14:56,991
Are you sure about this?

568
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:00,528
All right.

569
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:13,941
I can't do this.

570
01:15:55,884 --> 01:15:57,752
Are you Elizabeth brundy?

571
01:16:14,870 --> 01:16:16,737
Are you sure you're up
to making this trip?

572
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:19,774
Well, good luck.

573
01:16:22,644 --> 01:16:25,346
Don't let anyone see that for a while.
It's still pretty fresh.

574
01:20:24,253 --> 01:20:26,253
And forgive us our trespasses,

575
01:20:26,255 --> 01:20:29,390
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

576
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:31,425
And lead us not into temptation,

577
01:20:31,427 --> 01:20:32,560
but deliver us from evil.

578
01:20:33,528 --> 01:20:34,728
For thine is the kingdom

579
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:36,997
and the power and the glory,

580
01:20:36,999 --> 01:20:38,632
forever and ever. Amen.

581
01:21:02,991 --> 01:21:04,258
Tonight.

582
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,865
Joanna is still speaking Dutch.

583
01:21:10,867 --> 01:21:13,367
I hold you responsible for that.

584
01:21:13,369 --> 01:21:15,302
I'll pray
for the lord's assistance.

585
01:21:17,172 --> 01:21:19,173
As a wife, you have your duties.

586
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,543
"The wife does not have
authority over her own body

587
01:21:22,545 --> 01:21:25,512
"but yields it to her husband."
Please come with me.

588
01:21:28,383 --> 01:21:29,516
Not tonight.

589
01:21:32,787 --> 01:21:34,154
You leave me no choice.

590
01:22:06,655 --> 01:22:09,690
<i>We know why we came here.</i>

591
01:22:09,692 --> 01:22:12,192
<i>This is god's nation.</i>

592
01:22:12,194 --> 01:22:16,363
<i>The lord shed his grace
on this beautiful new country.</i>

593
01:22:17,232 --> 01:22:19,133
This was our exodus.

594
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:21,502
In this city on a hill,

595
01:22:21,504 --> 01:22:25,172
we will develop
a purer form of christianity.

596
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,876
Hadn't we all agreed

597
01:22:28,878 --> 01:22:32,046
to leave the old
language behind?

598
01:22:32,048 --> 01:22:35,482
Hadn't we sworn to do
things better over here?

599
01:22:35,484 --> 01:22:39,119
The new world would free us
from the sins of the old.

600
01:22:41,056 --> 01:22:44,258
We are the bright hope
of humanity.

601
01:22:44,993 --> 01:22:46,794
This is the promised land,

602
01:22:46,796 --> 01:22:50,698
and by coming here, we have
become his chosen people.

603
01:22:52,767 --> 01:22:54,335
Agatha,

604
01:22:54,337 --> 01:22:56,417
would you tell everyone
how you received the calling?

605
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,177
I was at home, peeling potatoes,

606
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:06,380
when this
huge white light appeared.

607
01:23:06,382 --> 01:23:09,683
In that light,
i saw a beautiful young man

608
01:23:09,685 --> 01:23:11,852
with white wings.

609
01:23:11,854 --> 01:23:14,555
I asked if he was an angel,

610
01:23:14,557 --> 01:23:17,758
and the young man
nodded and smiled.

611
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:19,193
Hmm...

612
01:23:20,528 --> 01:23:22,129
Arie,

613
01:23:22,131 --> 01:23:25,065
would you be so kind to share
your story of witness with us?

614
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:32,306
For me, it was more
or less the same thing,

615
01:23:32,308 --> 01:23:34,041
but it wasn't a man.

616
01:23:34,043 --> 01:23:38,312
It was a beautiful young woman
who showed herself to me.

617
01:23:40,181 --> 01:23:43,650
You see?
We are the chosen people.

618
01:23:43,652 --> 01:23:46,020
A visitation like that is not
something that happens

619
01:23:46,022 --> 01:23:48,288
to just anybody.
You have to earn it.

620
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,694
Anna,

621
01:23:53,696 --> 01:23:55,596
would you please
come to the front?

622
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:15,115
What about you, Anna?

623
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:16,717
Have you received
the calling yet?

624
01:24:20,321 --> 01:24:23,891
I have not been blessed
in such a way.

625
01:24:23,893 --> 01:24:28,095
In our community, everyone of age has
received such a calling, you have not.

626
01:24:29,230 --> 01:24:33,634
What did you do, Anna,
to anger god this much?

627
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,473
My own wife,

628
01:24:39,475 --> 01:24:41,842
who cannot
find the lord's favor.

629
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:44,511
I am ashamed of you.

630
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,495
Father,

631
01:26:41,497 --> 01:26:43,697
I pray that my wife will
grow in her love for you,

632
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:45,399
and me.

633
01:26:45,401 --> 01:26:47,501
May she love us
with all her heart,

634
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:50,871
all her soul, all her mind,
and all her might.

635
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,373
Give me the strength
to lead her to the salvation

636
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:55,209
provided by your grace.

637
01:26:55,211 --> 01:26:57,878
In Jesus' name, amen.

638
01:28:57,598 --> 01:28:59,333
You must wash your daughter.

639
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:01,668
She is unclean.

640
01:29:09,043 --> 01:29:11,445
But he never raises
a finger to help out.

641
01:29:14,649 --> 01:29:15,916
It's a woman's fate.

642
01:29:16,851 --> 01:29:18,218
Says who?

643
01:29:18,220 --> 01:29:19,519
Says the Bible.

644
01:29:21,155 --> 01:29:22,489
It's not fair.

645
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:26,193
Your father's
a man of the cloth.

646
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:28,795
He serves god and leaves
earthly chores to his wife.

647
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,734
What do you want?

648
01:29:33,736 --> 01:29:35,416
Leave us alone,
i have to talk to the girl.

649
01:29:48,816 --> 01:29:50,951
Has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman?

650
01:29:53,154 --> 01:29:54,721
Yes.

651
01:29:54,723 --> 01:29:56,356
And the blood
has penetrated into your life

652
01:29:56,358 --> 01:29:58,392
and driven out the innocence.

653
01:29:58,394 --> 01:30:01,428
It won't be long before men
start to find you attractive.

654
01:30:06,968 --> 01:30:09,236
Woman?
I know you're listening.

655
01:30:09,238 --> 01:30:11,438
From now on, you must treat
Joanna like a woman.

656
01:30:12,840 --> 01:30:14,674
As of today,
you will do the hogs.

657
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:31,425
Hey.

658
01:30:58,553 --> 01:30:59,886
Hello, lady.

659
01:31:12,533 --> 01:31:14,768
I saw the pump.

660
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,903
I was hoping
you'd be kind enough

661
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:18,638
to let me quench my thirst.

662
01:31:41,562 --> 01:31:44,998
Allow me to express
my deepest thanks.

663
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:47,567
Where are you men from?

664
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:49,202
Oh, that's a long story.

665
01:31:50,571 --> 01:31:51,938
Maybe some other time.

666
01:31:54,008 --> 01:31:55,141
What about him?

667
01:31:55,143 --> 01:31:57,544
You take care of him.

668
01:31:57,546 --> 01:31:59,813
After all, you are
a Christian, I assume?

669
01:32:02,116 --> 01:32:03,250
God damn me.

670
01:32:31,312 --> 01:32:33,113
Get the horse.

671
01:32:33,115 --> 01:32:34,714
My parents would find you two.

672
01:32:35,850 --> 01:32:39,753
Then get the goddamn saddle.

673
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:49,863
Go!

674
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:53,733
Go on, get out of here!
Go on!

675
01:33:05,112 --> 01:33:07,147
Damn bullet needs
to get taken out.

676
01:33:11,986 --> 01:33:13,853
And I need taking care of too.

677
01:33:14,789 --> 01:33:16,556
My father won't like that.

678
01:33:16,558 --> 01:33:18,191
Yeah...

679
01:33:18,193 --> 01:33:20,794
You know what?
Don't fuckin' tell him.

680
01:33:44,251 --> 01:33:45,652
Here it comes.

681
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:13,146
I reckon, it's about time
i introduced myself.

682
01:34:16,350 --> 01:34:17,417
I'm Samuel.

683
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:21,021
It's nice to meet you...

684
01:34:21,422 --> 01:34:23,023
Joanna.

685
01:34:23,025 --> 01:34:24,090
Joanna.

686
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,260
Thank you.

687
01:34:42,576 --> 01:34:44,177
The girl is growing fast.

688
01:35:09,370 --> 01:35:10,737
Hi, sweetie.

689
01:35:11,806 --> 01:35:13,473
He's running a fever.

690
01:35:13,475 --> 01:35:15,108
Are you sure?

691
01:35:15,110 --> 01:35:17,310
'Cause they say the best way
to take someone's temperature

692
01:35:17,312 --> 01:35:18,812
is with the lips, huh?

693
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:40,500
How old are you now, child?

694
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:43,136
Thirteen.

695
01:35:47,141 --> 01:35:49,709
A full-grown woman has...

696
01:35:49,711 --> 01:35:52,746
Has duties in life that a
young girl can't fulfill.

697
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:58,017
Duties imposed
by our lord himself.

698
01:36:03,691 --> 01:36:04,958
Come with me, please.

699
01:36:16,670 --> 01:36:19,706
Your mother does not always
assume responsibilities

700
01:36:19,708 --> 01:36:21,107
the way she should.

701
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:24,077
She does not comply
with her natural duties.

702
01:36:25,846 --> 01:36:27,280
Do you understand what I mean?

703
01:36:31,819 --> 01:36:36,256
God has made you a woman
so soon for a reason.

704
01:36:36,258 --> 01:36:37,824
You might believe it
to be a curse,

705
01:36:37,826 --> 01:36:39,826
but he has a reason
for everything.

706
01:36:41,162 --> 01:36:44,831
You have,
as the apostle Paul put it,

707
01:36:44,833 --> 01:36:46,499
"passed the flower
of your age."

708
01:36:47,501 --> 01:36:48,802
This is not right.

709
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,238
You have seen the blood.

710
01:36:53,908 --> 01:36:55,308
She's just a child.

711
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:00,980
I need not answer to you.
Only to god.

712
01:37:38,853 --> 01:37:40,186
No, thank you, Anna.

713
01:37:41,121 --> 01:37:42,622
Our god has other plans.

714
01:38:10,484 --> 01:38:11,885
It'll be all right.

715
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:15,655
Use both hands.

716
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:20,193
Don't let the blast scare you.

717
01:39:21,989 --> 01:39:23,423
You're a grown
woman now, Joanna.

718
01:40:25,319 --> 01:40:27,153
Could I talk to you
for a moment?

719
01:40:35,062 --> 01:40:37,597
I want to offer my apologies.

720
01:40:37,599 --> 01:40:40,299
I withheld from you that
to which you have a right.

721
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:42,568
That was wrong of me.

722
01:40:45,806 --> 01:40:46,939
Apology accepted.

723
01:40:46,941 --> 01:40:48,441
Let me make it up to you.

724
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:51,277
It's too late for that.

725
01:40:52,613 --> 01:40:54,247
I have seen how you look at her.

726
01:40:57,084 --> 01:40:58,384
She's your own daughter.

727
01:41:06,860 --> 01:41:08,294
It's a sin.

728
01:41:08,296 --> 01:41:10,096
It does not have to be.

729
01:41:10,098 --> 01:41:12,899
"If any man thinks that he is
behaving himself unseemly

730
01:41:12,901 --> 01:41:15,768
"towards his virgin daughter, if
she pass the flower of her age,

731
01:41:15,770 --> 01:41:18,971
"and if need so requires,
let him do what he will,

732
01:41:18,973 --> 01:41:21,207
"he is not sinning,
let them marry."

733
01:41:27,981 --> 01:41:29,315
You shall be scolded.

734
01:41:43,130 --> 01:41:44,397
Good girl.

735
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:16,796
That sure as hell
took long enough.

736
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:21,901
Where are you going?

737
01:42:21,903 --> 01:42:23,236
Gonna take a crap.

738
01:42:26,006 --> 01:42:27,286
Where do you
want me to put this?

739
01:42:28,175 --> 01:42:29,542
I need some rope
and I need it fast.

740
01:42:29,544 --> 01:42:30,910
Can you get that for me?

741
01:42:32,613 --> 01:42:33,713
Good.

742
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:46,145
I had to do that.

743
01:44:46,147 --> 01:44:49,415
If I hadn't, he'd have
killed me at some point.

744
01:44:50,417 --> 01:44:52,051
Better him than me, I'd say.

745
01:44:55,722 --> 01:44:58,591
I heard that story once,

746
01:44:58,593 --> 01:45:01,327
the one about turning the
other cheek and all that.

747
01:45:02,996 --> 01:45:05,865
The only person who'd
say something like that

748
01:45:05,867 --> 01:45:08,534
is someone who's in control.

749
01:45:10,137 --> 01:45:12,738
Someone who doesn't want
you to stand up to him.

750
01:45:17,010 --> 01:45:18,077
I've seen your mother.

751
01:45:20,013 --> 01:45:22,615
She's the kind of person
that turns the other cheek.

752
01:45:24,885 --> 01:45:25,985
Are you like her?

753
01:46:48,835 --> 01:46:50,536
Why do you let him do this?

754
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:54,006
I'll never be like you.

755
01:46:55,142 --> 01:46:56,542
This is no way to live.

756
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:00,846
I'd rather die first.

757
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:29,208
The serpent said to the woman,

758
01:47:29,210 --> 01:47:31,143
"you surely will not die!

759
01:47:31,145 --> 01:47:33,612
"For god knows that in
the day you eat from it,

760
01:47:33,614 --> 01:47:34,980
"your eyes will be opened,

761
01:47:34,982 --> 01:47:38,851
"and you will be like god,
knowing good and evil."

762
01:47:38,853 --> 01:47:41,720
And when the woman saw that
the tree was good for food,

763
01:47:41,722 --> 01:47:43,222
and was a delight to the eyes,

764
01:47:43,224 --> 01:47:47,226
and that the tree was
desirable to make one wise,

765
01:47:47,228 --> 01:47:49,695
she took from its fruit and ate.

766
01:47:51,198 --> 01:47:53,966
And then the lord god said
to the woman,

767
01:47:53,968 --> 01:47:57,236
"i will greatly multiply
your pain in childbirth.

768
01:47:57,238 --> 01:47:59,705
"In pain you will
bring forth children,

769
01:47:59,707 --> 01:48:03,642
"yet your desire
will be for your husband.

770
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:05,744
"And he will rule over you."

771
01:48:13,854 --> 01:48:15,521
This is an abomination.

772
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:19,158
This is an abomination!

773
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,060
Does she not know
that her body is

774
01:48:21,062 --> 01:48:24,530
the temple of the holy spirit,
which she received from god?

775
01:48:25,566 --> 01:48:27,566
This is a disgrace.

776
01:48:27,568 --> 01:48:29,902
She will be punished in hell.

777
01:48:29,904 --> 01:48:33,472
She will be transformed
into a thorny tree,

778
01:48:33,474 --> 01:48:36,942
and in a tortured wood, she
will be punished by harpies,

779
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:39,545
who will dig their sharp
talons into her,

780
01:48:39,547 --> 01:48:41,814
until the blood
comes flowing down!

781
01:48:46,354 --> 01:48:47,620
Oh, lord.

782
01:48:48,421 --> 01:48:49,655
Forgive me.

783
01:48:49,657 --> 01:48:50,856
You know I have
tried to keep her

784
01:48:50,858 --> 01:48:53,492
on the narrow way to repentance.

785
01:48:53,494 --> 01:48:54,960
But like the gospel
of Matthew says,

786
01:48:54,962 --> 01:48:57,696
"the way is broad
that leads to destruction."

787
01:48:59,266 --> 01:49:00,533
I spoke to her.

788
01:49:02,002 --> 01:49:03,269
I chastised her.

789
01:49:06,239 --> 01:49:07,573
But to no avail.

790
01:49:10,076 --> 01:49:11,143
I failed.

791
01:50:02,062 --> 01:50:04,296
There, there.

792
01:50:04,298 --> 01:50:05,364
It's all right.

793
01:50:06,766 --> 01:50:08,033
It's all right.

794
01:50:21,581 --> 01:50:22,848
I'm old enough.

795
01:50:26,653 --> 01:50:27,920
I know.

796
01:51:09,963 --> 01:51:11,296
God has forgiven me.

797
01:51:12,565 --> 01:51:13,832
I am ready.

798
01:51:24,978 --> 01:51:28,347
<i>Thank you, lord.
Thank you, almighty.</i>

799
01:51:28,349 --> 01:51:31,250
<i>You saw, and foresaw all.</i>

800
01:51:31,252 --> 01:51:34,153
<i>You saw that my wife did not
do what you expected of her.</i>

801
01:51:34,155 --> 01:51:39,224
That she did not love you,
or me, as my daughter will.

802
01:51:39,226 --> 01:51:42,494
Lot lay with his daughters and
they bore children unto him.

803
01:51:42,496 --> 01:51:45,664
Joanna and I shall enter
a state of matrimony

804
01:51:45,666 --> 01:51:48,000
and she shall bear my children.

805
01:51:48,002 --> 01:51:50,302
We shall be joyous
and honor you.

806
01:51:51,471 --> 01:51:53,072
Let me go!

807
01:51:53,074 --> 01:51:54,440
Fear not.

808
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:56,375
No!

809
01:51:56,377 --> 01:51:58,744
No!

810
01:51:58,746 --> 01:52:01,447
It is the will of god.
We are his chosen ones.

811
01:52:03,284 --> 01:52:06,285
When two people make their vows
in the name of the everlasting,

812
01:52:06,287 --> 01:52:09,722
they pronounce their wish to belong
to each other fully in love.

813
01:52:09,724 --> 01:52:13,225
Together they shall search for
what god wants from their lives.

814
01:52:13,227 --> 01:52:15,561
Together they shall
perform their duties

815
01:52:15,563 --> 01:52:16,929
and care for their family.

816
01:52:43,256 --> 01:52:46,358
My father was a real bastard.

817
01:52:46,360 --> 01:52:49,762
He used to put cigars out
on my arm, the sadistic fuck.

818
01:52:51,831 --> 01:52:55,934
And he was a pervert,
just like you.

819
01:52:55,936 --> 01:52:58,270
I killed him
when I was nine years old.

820
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:01,206
Who are you?

821
01:53:01,208 --> 01:53:03,308
You have a real
special daughter.

822
01:53:04,544 --> 01:53:06,145
She deserves to be free.

823
01:53:13,820 --> 01:53:16,989
You think you can come in here and
take that which belongs to me?

824
01:53:17,957 --> 01:53:21,927
Yeah. What do you think?

825
01:53:21,929 --> 01:53:24,163
That god's gonna come
down here and save you?

826
01:53:30,303 --> 01:53:31,970
I am as god.

827
01:53:31,972 --> 01:53:34,273
He is as I am.

828
01:53:45,251 --> 01:53:47,386
I will love you.

829
01:53:47,388 --> 01:53:49,121
And you will learn to love me.

830
01:53:49,123 --> 01:53:51,723
It is god's will.
I will kill you.

831
01:53:51,725 --> 01:53:53,492
That would not stop me.

832
01:53:53,494 --> 01:53:54,827
You're mad.

833
01:53:54,829 --> 01:53:56,361
Who was that man?

834
01:53:56,363 --> 01:53:58,630
He put foolish thoughts
in your mind.

835
01:53:58,632 --> 01:54:00,933
He helped me.
I love him.

836
01:54:03,269 --> 01:54:05,237
No, you do not.

837
01:54:05,805 --> 01:54:07,139
It is lust.

838
01:54:09,742 --> 01:54:11,009
Yes.

839
01:54:16,149 --> 01:54:18,283
I will beat your mother
out of you.

840
01:54:44,177 --> 01:54:47,613
The time has come.

841
01:54:47,615 --> 01:54:48,881
I will be gentle.

842
01:57:18,265 --> 01:57:20,599
He ain't never
gonna stop, is he?

843
02:00:44,036 --> 02:00:45,370
I'll be fine.

844
02:00:58,284 --> 02:00:59,851
Are we there yet?

845
02:01:23,175 --> 02:01:24,643
Ah!

846
02:01:26,312 --> 02:01:28,346
What was that?

847
02:01:28,348 --> 02:01:30,582
No, let me go!

848
02:01:30,584 --> 02:01:32,651
- Stay there!
- Matthew!

849
02:01:32,653 --> 02:01:35,053
Stay there, Sam.
Whatever happens!

850
02:01:35,055 --> 02:01:36,321
Matthew!

851
02:01:39,258 --> 02:01:40,592
Ah!

852
02:01:46,299 --> 02:01:47,699
Matthew!

853
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:47,051
Oh, Liz...

854
02:03:49,155 --> 02:03:52,590
I'd always hoped this place
would be Eli's someday.

855
02:03:55,194 --> 02:03:56,561
I mean...

856
02:03:56,563 --> 02:03:57,829
He could've...

857
02:03:59,064 --> 02:04:00,732
I don't know...

858
02:04:00,734 --> 02:04:02,567
A sawmill or something...

859
02:04:27,560 --> 02:04:29,727
Are you sure?

860
02:04:29,729 --> 02:04:31,796
Have you ever fired
one of those things before?

861
02:04:36,535 --> 02:04:38,670
I should be the one
holding the gun.

862
02:05:14,340 --> 02:05:16,875
There's no use
shooting from that distance.

863
02:05:28,487 --> 02:05:29,954
It's more difficult
than you think,

864
02:05:31,557 --> 02:05:33,057
especially with a gun like that.

865
02:05:46,372 --> 02:05:49,674
I was truly prepared to
forgive you, back in bismuth.

866
02:05:51,310 --> 02:05:52,577
I loved you.

867
02:05:53,379 --> 02:05:54,646
You should have seen that.

868
02:05:58,884 --> 02:06:00,585
You've turned against me,

869
02:06:02,187 --> 02:06:03,288
just like your mother.

870
02:06:05,224 --> 02:06:08,259
But again, I have been
provided with an alternative.

871
02:06:11,697 --> 02:06:13,197
That's right, Joanna.

872
02:06:14,967 --> 02:06:17,268
Your daughter shall
suffer for your actions.

873
02:06:18,904 --> 02:06:22,674
And I will make you watch
as I chastise her.

874
02:06:22,676 --> 02:06:25,944
And after that, you will witness
how i make her a woman.

875
02:06:28,847 --> 02:06:30,715
You believe she's safe in there?

876
02:06:31,717 --> 02:06:33,751
That I cannot get to her?

877
02:06:35,454 --> 02:06:37,155
You left her alone, Joanna.

878
02:06:37,990 --> 02:06:40,692
Never leave your
loved ones alone.

879
02:06:40,694 --> 02:06:42,293
You should know that by now.

880
02:06:47,267 --> 02:06:50,068
What is the worst thing
i could do to you, Joanna?

881
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:53,905
Lucky for her, she was asleep.

882
02:06:54,640 --> 02:06:56,107
She did not see a thing.

883
02:07:11,256 --> 02:07:12,957
Huh, what...

884
02:07:35,381 --> 02:07:38,650
Beware of false prophets

885
02:07:39,818 --> 02:07:42,854
who come to you
in sheep's clothing...

886
02:07:44,223 --> 02:07:48,092
For inwardly,
they are ravening wolves.

887
02:08:18,090 --> 02:08:19,157
Mama!

888
02:08:22,661 --> 02:08:24,762
No, mama! Mama!

889
02:08:25,364 --> 02:08:26,431
No!

890
02:08:31,336 --> 02:08:32,837
Mama!

891
02:08:33,572 --> 02:08:34,872
Mama!

892
02:08:57,029 --> 02:08:59,931
I will do to your daughter
exactly as I did to you.

893
02:09:03,836 --> 02:09:06,003
I am going to hurt you
as much as I can.

894
02:09:48,547 --> 02:09:49,981
I will leave the door open.

895
02:10:27,286 --> 02:10:28,419
I brought you this.

896
02:10:35,227 --> 02:10:37,929
Has your mother told you
what it means to be a woman?

897
02:10:40,632 --> 02:10:44,068
Many people believe that god
does not approve of violence.

898
02:10:45,404 --> 02:10:48,139
They have not read their Bible.

899
02:10:48,141 --> 02:10:51,909
"Violence cleanses evil.
It purifies the heart."

900
02:10:53,679 --> 02:10:55,546
Does your heart need purifying?

901
02:10:57,115 --> 02:10:58,449
Have you had bad thoughts?

902
02:11:00,018 --> 02:11:02,053
About men, perhaps?

903
02:11:04,623 --> 02:11:05,890
Do you like men?

904
02:11:13,632 --> 02:11:14,966
Have you bled yet?

905
02:11:33,919 --> 02:11:36,120
I am a doomed man, Sam.

906
02:11:38,523 --> 02:11:40,591
Beyond salvation.

907
02:11:40,593 --> 02:11:42,560
I can do whatever I want.

908
02:11:48,600 --> 02:11:51,602
Young girls still carry
the scent of innocence.

909
02:11:53,138 --> 02:11:56,240
Older women smell different.

910
02:12:07,819 --> 02:12:09,287
The time has come.

911
02:12:57,536 --> 02:13:00,538
People think it's the flames
that make hell unbearable.

912
02:13:02,641 --> 02:13:03,708
It's not.

913
02:13:05,010 --> 02:13:07,144
It is the absence of love.

914
02:14:13,011 --> 02:14:14,278
Hey.

915
02:14:18,984 --> 02:14:20,251
Mmm-hmm.

916
02:14:49,514 --> 02:14:53,484
Well...
Long time no see, Liz.

917
02:15:01,793 --> 02:15:03,194
I was a broken man.

918
02:15:04,229 --> 02:15:05,663
Couldn't go on living there.

919
02:15:07,399 --> 02:15:08,532
Good thing the new
preacher showed me

920
02:15:08,534 --> 02:15:11,235
I had to go try somewhere else.

921
02:15:11,237 --> 02:15:13,804
He was the one, told me they
was lookin' for deputies...

922
02:15:14,940 --> 02:15:16,240
Up in bismuth.

923
02:15:17,576 --> 02:15:19,543
I made myself up
a new life there.

924
02:15:22,347 --> 02:15:25,616
About a year ago, the sheriff
there got himself shot.

925
02:15:26,685 --> 02:15:28,385
And I was chosen to replace him.

926
02:15:30,288 --> 02:15:32,423
And while I was
cleaning out his office...

927
02:15:36,061 --> 02:15:37,328
I found this.

928
02:15:42,567 --> 02:15:44,702
You should've changed
your name, Liz.

929
02:15:46,805 --> 02:15:48,038
How many Elizabeth brundys

930
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:49,807
you figure there
are in this world?

931
02:15:49,809 --> 02:15:52,843
And how many of 'em you
figure don't got no tongue?

932
02:15:58,049 --> 02:15:59,850
Elizabeth brundy,

933
02:15:59,852 --> 02:16:03,521
I hereby arrest you for the
murder of frank blain,

934
02:16:03,523 --> 02:16:07,324
your former employer and
proprietor of frank's inferno.

935
02:16:38,390 --> 02:16:40,624
Your past done
caught up with you, Liz.

936
02:17:40,685 --> 02:17:44,388
<i>As life progresses, images blur.</i>

937
02:17:46,725 --> 02:17:48,559
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

938
02:17:58,270 --> 02:17:59,370
<i>I remember her well.</i>

939
02:18:02,073 --> 02:18:03,407
<i>She was a warrior.</i>

940
02:18:04,175 --> 02:18:05,576
<i>Always in control.</i>

941
02:18:27,365 --> 02:18:31,001
<i>I've often wondered what she was
thinking about on her way down.</i>

942
02:18:35,006 --> 02:18:36,974
<i>I like to think
she thought of me.</i>

943
02:18:40,845 --> 02:18:44,348
<i>I like to think she knew
I would grow up to be strong.</i>

944
02:19:39,104 --> 02:19:40,537
<i>I remember her well.</i>

945
02:19:41,673 --> 02:19:43,107
<i>At least I think I do.</i>

946
02:19:47,011 --> 02:19:49,680
<i>It feels like she always
stayed with me.</i>

947
02:19:54,285 --> 02:19:55,552
<i>Watching over me.</i>

948
02:19:57,689 --> 02:19:59,223
<i>Protecting me.</i>

949
02:19:59,225 --> 02:20:01,558
Hey, come on.
Put that down.

950
02:20:17,308 --> 02:20:18,575
Mama?

951
02:20:19,144 --> 02:20:20,411
You coming?
