1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,712
- [Narrator] See the most
fantastic terror thrills

2
00:00:06,712 --> 00:00:09,385
the screen has ever brought you.

3
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:12,998
(Women screaming)

4
00:00:12,998 --> 00:00:15,203
(man screaming)

5
00:00:15,203 --> 00:00:17,494
(woman screaming)

6
00:00:17,494 --> 00:00:19,087
(man screaming)

7
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:19,920
Beware.

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,256
(Demon laughing maniacally)

9
00:00:21,256 --> 00:00:23,760
(man laughing creepily)

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,350
- The first Roman Grocer film I ever saw

11
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,570
was called Scream Queen Massacre,

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,620
the one where the bathing
beauty contestants

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,900
were stalked and killed by
the raving, psycho maniac.

14
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,980
I was 10 years old

15
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,710
and that was when I decided
to become a filmmaker

16
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:48,810
Slaughter Studios in its day was the best.

17
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:52,766
Roman Grocer had produced 122 films here,

18
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:56,423
and I have seen every single one of them.

19
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,580
- [Man] But we were (mumbles)

20
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,442
- Not cooked, you?

21
00:01:01,442 --> 00:01:02,810
(Mumbles) is cooked.

22
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:04,170
This was a lobster.

23
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,873
No, one lobster, a giant lobster.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,930
Lemme talk to the boss.

25
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,450
- [Steve] I don't know
how many you've seen,

26
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:14,270
but I have a few of my favorites.

27
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:16,530
Lumberjack, my dad took me.

28
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,707
After 10 minutes, he
wanted to leave the theater

29
00:01:18,707 --> 00:01:21,143
but I talked him into staying.

30
00:01:21,143 --> 00:01:25,270
Fungus, I loved the
tagline: It'll grow on you.

31
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:27,950
His first and only western, Tin Can Kelly.

32
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,600
Brilliant.

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,400
Hobbes, the only feminist
(mumbles) I can recall.

34
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:34,960
Cherry Hill High.

35
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,590
Loved Cherry Hill High, just because.

36
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:41,610
Of course, Rock n' Roll Diner,

37
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,390
which I first saw with my little brother.

38
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,343
This film made my brother piss his pants.

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,910
Too bad the Justin Kirkpatrick
thing had to happen.

40
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:53,030
- Where the fuck are my actors?!

41
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,390
- Hey, you don't have
to wait for me, Roman.

42
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,671
- You don't have to wait
for me either, baby.

43
00:01:58,671 --> 00:01:59,847
(Bell dinging)

44
00:01:59,847 --> 00:02:01,421
- Mr Kirkpatrick!

45
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,671
Mr Kirkpatrick!

46
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:06,160
Mr. Kirkpatrick, they need you on the set.

47
00:02:07,405 --> 00:02:08,443
They're ready for you.

48
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,693
- We're almost done, one minute.

49
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:18,914
- That feel okay, Justin?

50
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:22,610
- You know some of this
tape's pinchin' me, man.

51
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,673
It's fuckin' cold.

52
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,780
- If you think it hurts now,
wait 'til we take it off.

53
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:27,693
- (Scoffs) Jesus.

54
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,583
- Where have you been?

55
00:02:31,583 --> 00:02:33,660
Can you get on set, please?
- Alright, alright.

56
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,500
- I'm waitin' forever.

57
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,810
What the hell took you?

58
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,163
Come on!

59
00:02:37,163 --> 00:02:39,230
Tryin' to make a movie here, will ya?

60
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,063
Put yourself where you're supposed to be.

61
00:02:40,063 --> 00:02:41,940
Okay, is everybody set?

62
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,090
Is everybody in places?

63
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,770
Could we have some quiet?

64
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,705
Alright, roll sound!
- Speed!

65
00:02:47,705 --> 00:02:48,538
(Bell dinging)

66
00:02:48,538 --> 00:02:49,371
- Roll camera!

67
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:50,204
Mark it!

68
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,650
- [Man] 78-1, mark.

69
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:52,483
- Are we ready?

70
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,261
Action!

71
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:57,928
(Film whirring)

72
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,581
- What're you whacked-out
horse bags doin' here?

73
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:05,741
How many times I gotta tell
you to stay away from my club?

74
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:10,741
- (Chuckles) If it ain't Rock
Candy, all rag and sweet-like.

75
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:12,683
Ooh.

76
00:03:12,683 --> 00:03:13,516
- Oh yeah?

77
00:03:13,516 --> 00:03:15,102
That's the way you want to play it, huh?

78
00:03:15,102 --> 00:03:15,935
Huh?

79
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:16,768
Let's go, (mumbles).

80
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:17,740
You want a piece of me?

81
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:18,970
You're goin' down, bitch.

82
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,880
Down.
- No way, Rock Candy.

83
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,964
(Rock Candy grunting)

84
00:03:22,964 --> 00:03:23,905
Eat lead!

85
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:26,488
(Gun blasting)

86
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,785
- Cut!

87
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:38,618
Cut, cut!

88
00:03:38,618 --> 00:03:39,550
(Crowd cheering)

89
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,600
What the fuck was that?

90
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:44,167
Nobody dies like that
in a Roman Grocer film!

91
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:45,552
Nobody!

92
00:03:45,552 --> 00:03:46,597
Ya understand, Justin?

93
00:03:47,987 --> 00:03:48,820
Justin!

94
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,927
Justin!

95
00:03:51,927 --> 00:03:54,927
(Soft somber music)

96
00:04:01,755 --> 00:04:02,939
- Justin?

97
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:03,858
- [Man] He's not movin'.

98
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:07,025
(Muffled whispering)

99
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:21,392
- Call an ambulance, Justin's been shot!

100
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:30,323
- That was the last film ever
made at Slaughter Studios.

101
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,983
It's been rotting away for
more than 20 years now.

102
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:37,564
(Door creaking)

103
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,177
Some say this place is haunted

104
00:04:45,052 --> 00:04:46,270
and the ghost of Justin Kirkpatrick

105
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,050
still roams these hallways
and empty sound stages

106
00:04:50,856 --> 00:04:53,213
to this day looking to
finish his last film.

107
00:04:59,794 --> 00:05:01,830
That's where we come in.

108
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,830
- Steve, what have you got up your sleeve?

109
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,040
- A secret plan, Madi.

110
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,700
He's right on time like clockwork.

111
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,536
- What's so secret you can't
tell your own girlfriend?

112
00:05:10,536 --> 00:05:15,536
- You'll find out along with
the others. (Laughs maniacally)

113
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:19,450
- Naughty Sex Kittens versus
the Giant Praying Mantis?

114
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,920
- We're gonna make it
in the truest tradition

115
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,200
at Slaughter Studios.

116
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,680
No time, no money, it'll be great!

117
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,440
But we've got to hurry before
they demolish the place.

118
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,273
- How many weeks?

119
00:05:28,273 --> 00:05:29,106
- Nine hours.

120
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,363
- Nine hours?

121
00:05:31,363 --> 00:05:32,640
- That's right, tonight!

122
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,650
- How are we possibly gonna do that?

123
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,640
- Digital video.

124
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,080
Everyone's goin' digital these days.

125
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,390
Gary's got a camera, it'll work.

126
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,370
Tell 'em, Gary.

127
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,050
- I've got a camera, it'll work.

128
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,050
- Now what we do need is

129
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,688
four or five great-looking actresses

130
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:46,150
who can stay up all night
and do nudity for free.

131
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,310
- I've got some girls in my class.

132
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:48,345
They'll totally do it.

133
00:05:48,345 --> 00:05:49,178
- Great!

134
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:50,812
- Some of them are actually good.

135
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:51,645
- It doesn't matter.

136
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:53,290
This script is bulletproof.

137
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:56,064
Bring as many as you
can; any actors as well.

138
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:57,040
(Silverware crashing)

139
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,873
- Dammit!

140
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,263
- I'm sorry.

141
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:03,096
Sorry.
- Yeah.

142
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,149
- [Woman] This is Kevin.

143
00:06:06,149 --> 00:06:06,982
- Hey.

144
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:09,130
Hi, hey.
- Hey.

145
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,323
- This is Steve, Madigan, Gary.

146
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,790
- Hi, how are ya?
- Nice to meet you, Kevin.

147
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:16,318
It's a pleasure.

148
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:17,618
- Alright get a seat, Kev.

149
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,440
Kevin is classically trained.

150
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,820
He studied in London;
Shakespeare for four years.

151
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,583
He's great.
- Is that so?

152
00:06:26,857 --> 00:06:29,860
- Thou art a fellow of good respect.

153
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,483
Thy life had some smatch of honor in it.

154
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,970
Take then my sword and turn away thy face

155
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,423
while I do run upon it.

156
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,327
Wilt thou, Strato?

157
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,003
Farewell, good Strato.

158
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:48,930
Caesar, now be still! (Breathes heavily)

159
00:06:50,543 --> 00:06:53,634
- That was amazing.
- Thanks.

160
00:06:53,634 --> 00:06:55,809
- Can I be in it?

161
00:06:55,809 --> 00:06:59,182
- Sweetheart, I was hoping
you'd do makeup and wardrobe.

162
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:00,770
- Oh.

163
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,370
- Hello Sex Kittens, what is up?

164
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,657
I'm seeing party started without me.

165
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:06,640
Did I miss anything?

166
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,342
- Well Ollie, only the greatest
opportunity of your life.

167
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:12,153
- (Mumbles), count me inside.

168
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,180
Ready to do some acting?

169
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,080
- You bet.

170
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,943
What's my role?

171
00:07:19,516 --> 00:07:22,310
(Praying mantis growling)

172
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,143
- Brilliant.

173
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:26,480
The movie is only as good
as the monster is bad.

174
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,340
- That's pretty awful.

175
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,740
- Did you remember to pack the blood?

176
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,844
- A whole gallon.

177
00:07:29,844 --> 00:07:30,677
- Great!

178
00:07:32,163 --> 00:07:36,206
Here they come. (Laughs)

179
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:37,422
Hello, hello!

180
00:07:37,422 --> 00:07:38,520
- How ya doin'?
- Great!

181
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,419
- Ready to meet your cast?
- Absolutely.

182
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:41,843
- Alright.

183
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:43,050
Here you go.

184
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:45,087
Rebecca, this is Steve.

185
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:46,100
(Van banging)

186
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,591
- Hi, Sam.

187
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:48,760
What's your name again?

188
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,680
- Steve.

189
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,370
- Oh hi Steve, I'm Rebecca.

190
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:52,203
- It's a pleasure.

191
00:07:52,203 --> 00:07:53,591
Nice to meet you, Rebecca.

192
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:57,258
- Nice to meet you too.
- Lovely, very, very.

193
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,870
- Hi there, Darlene Valentine.

194
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:02,020
- Yes.
- Nice to meet you.

195
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,187
- Nice to meet you, Darlene.

196
00:08:03,187 --> 00:08:04,985
I'm Steve.

197
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,027
Very beautiful.
- Oh, hi.

198
00:08:07,027 --> 00:08:09,277
- Hello.
- Hey, I'm Candyce.

199
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,543
I'm here to meet Justin.

200
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:13,270
- Nice to meet you, Candyce.

201
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:14,603
Very, very nice.

202
00:08:16,747 --> 00:08:18,160
- Oh no, germs too rampant.

203
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,730
I'm allergic.

204
00:08:19,730 --> 00:08:21,040
- You are?

205
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,220
- Portia, like the car only spelled

206
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,180
so you can understand how to pronounce it.

207
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:26,280
- Portia, charming.

208
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,580
- Listen, I've never done

209
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,530
one of these monster flicks before.

210
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:32,130
I don't wanna leave that
slimy stuff on my body

211
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,130
otherwise I'll walk.

212
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,363
Oh be a doll and carry
this for me, will ya?

213
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,930
- She's just a little bitch.

214
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:41,130
- Hey there, everybody.

215
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,360
I'm Chad Daniels.

216
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,310
Glad to be here.

217
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:45,230
- Hello Chad, I'm Steve Sperg.

218
00:08:45,230 --> 00:08:47,510
Nice to meet you.
- Right, bro.

219
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,343
You're the man.

220
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:49,580
- Yes, I suppose.
- Right.

221
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,380
- I'm ready for my up-close, Mr (mumbles).

222
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,371
- Hello, Ollie.

223
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:56,748
- Do your worst.

224
00:08:56,748 --> 00:08:57,740
I gave him all the script I have.

225
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,740
I kinda noticed there
wasn't that many lines.

226
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,540
- I only counted 8 1/2 lines for my part.

227
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,797
- Yeah.
- Yeah, what's up with that?

228
00:09:04,797 --> 00:09:08,240
- That's because this is
a conceptual horror story

229
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,360
about the obsessive love

230
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,800
between humans and overgrown nature.

231
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,480
We'll be improvising most
of the lines. (Laughs)

232
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,690
Right this way.

233
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,223
- He must be a genius.

234
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:22,420
(Van door slamming)

235
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,829
- [Ollie] I'd kill for
eight lines in a movie.

236
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:26,412
- You counted them?

237
00:09:29,325 --> 00:09:32,318
- Gather 'round, gather 'round.

238
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,190
The only thing we must watch out for

239
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,150
is a security guard who makes his rounds

240
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,000
five minutes 'til every hour at which time

241
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,713
we must shut off all the
lights until he's finished.

242
00:09:45,815 --> 00:09:46,648
(Energetic fanfare music)

243
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:47,863
Let's make history.

244
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,153
We're going in!

245
00:09:51,813 --> 00:09:52,980
Gary, help me.

246
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:56,727
(Steve grunting)

247
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:58,440
- The fuck's in here?

248
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,266
- This thing is heavy.

249
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:05,266
(All screaming)
(startling music)

250
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:07,562
- (mumbles) head back to the cage.

251
00:10:07,562 --> 00:10:10,160
- Get away, you (mumbles) mortal.

252
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,993
- Sorry.

253
00:10:12,097 --> 00:10:15,014
(Intriguing music)

254
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:22,220
- What's the hold up?

255
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,285
- Laughter Studios?

256
00:10:23,285 --> 00:10:25,483
Ooh, did they make comedies here?

257
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,513
- Yeah, sort of.

258
00:10:31,044 --> 00:10:33,711
(Ominous music)

259
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,453
this way, everyone.

260
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:46,286
This way.

261
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:48,643
- Ooh god.

262
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:54,272
Shit, this is (mumbles).

263
00:10:54,272 --> 00:10:56,516
- It's so creepy.

264
00:10:56,516 --> 00:10:57,920
- Come on, everyone.

265
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,500
I think it's right ahead.

266
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,780
(Eerie music)

267
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,927
- Hey, can I get a flashlight?

268
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:05,687
(Muffled crosstalk)

269
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:06,520
- Oh god, my (mumbles).

270
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,456
I can't breathe in this dust.

271
00:11:08,456 --> 00:11:09,378
What's that smell?

272
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:10,211
- [Ollie] I am getting heebie-jeebie.

273
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:12,798
- Do we have craft services on this shoot?

274
00:11:12,798 --> 00:11:14,360
You're gonna watch your step.

275
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,110
- Shit (mumbles), your tail.
- Oh I'm sorry, Gary.

276
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:17,943
- What a dump.

277
00:11:19,024 --> 00:11:20,603
- I'm gonna see Justin.

278
00:11:20,603 --> 00:11:21,436
(Mumbles) Justin was.

279
00:11:21,436 --> 00:11:23,560
- I don't have any
flashlights or (mumbles).

280
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:26,380
- Huh, who's that?

281
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,917
- [Chad] I'm supposed to star in this

282
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,000
and I don't even have a flashlight.

283
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,433
- Alright already, Chad.

284
00:11:31,549 --> 00:11:32,602
- Disgusting.

285
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,500
- Come on princess, move along up there.

286
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,730
- Slut.
- Excuse me?

287
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,110
What'd you say to me?

288
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:38,943
- Nothing.

289
00:11:38,943 --> 00:11:40,977
- Come back here and say that to my face.

290
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,668
- Come on you guys, don't fight.

291
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,137
We're making a movie.

292
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:44,970
(Body thudding)

293
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,803
Oh jeez.

294
00:11:45,803 --> 00:11:46,716
Chad, are you okay?

295
00:11:46,716 --> 00:11:47,549
- Yeah.

296
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:50,310
- (Screams) Spider!
- Shut up.

297
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,220
- You don't understand.

298
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,910
I'm allergic to spiders.
- You know what?

299
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,220
I'm allergic to you.

300
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:55,482
- Come on, (mumbles).

301
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,350
- Well if I could see, I
wouldn't be fallin' over stuff.

302
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,330
- Just stick close to us, okay?

303
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,163
- I don't have another flashlight.

304
00:12:00,163 --> 00:12:00,996
Keep it moving.

305
00:12:00,996 --> 00:12:01,829
- Steve, do you know where we're going?

306
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:03,640
- I think I see it.

307
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,990
- I can't see anything
and I need a flashlight.

308
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,093
I bet Eric Roberts doesn't work like this.

309
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:11,539
- Are we almost there?

310
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:12,562
- It's down this way.

311
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:14,660
It's down this way.

312
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,950
Stage 17.
- Why Stage 17?

313
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:20,331
- That's where Justin
Kirkpatrick was murdered.

314
00:12:20,331 --> 00:12:21,367
- It's just a rumor.

315
00:12:21,367 --> 00:12:24,270
- Crowbar.
- No, it's true.

316
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,253
He really was.

317
00:12:29,878 --> 00:12:33,791
- That was a cover up.
- Guys, watch your step.

318
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:34,967
(Mirror shattering)
(Portia screaming)

319
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:37,517
- [Ollie] Shut up, the
security guard will hear us!

320
00:12:39,687 --> 00:12:40,520
- It's alright, he's alright.

321
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,810
Security guy is deaf.

322
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:44,760
He can't hear a thing
just as long as the lights

323
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,490
are out at the proper time, alright?

324
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:48,693
- That's bad luck.

325
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,360
- No no, that was Justin.

326
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,473
I know it.

327
00:12:52,473 --> 00:12:53,610
It was Justin.

328
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,443
- Enough with the Justin.

329
00:12:54,443 --> 00:12:56,473
- No, it was him.

330
00:12:56,473 --> 00:12:58,973
(Eerie music)

331
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:05,863
- Alright everyone, come on inside.

332
00:13:05,863 --> 00:13:07,852
Right this way.

333
00:13:07,852 --> 00:13:08,999
There we go.

334
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:09,832
Right in slowly.

335
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:10,665
I know it's dark.

336
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,360
Don't worry, come on.

337
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,070
Madigan, come on in.

338
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,200
Here we go.

339
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,170
Chad over here, come on.

340
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:19,070
- Oh god, I can't believe
we're actually making a movie.

341
00:13:19,070 --> 00:13:20,883
- Don't worry honey,
you'll get used to it.

342
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:21,716
- Where's my trailer?

343
00:13:21,716 --> 00:13:23,338
- Smells literal ca-ca here.

344
00:13:23,338 --> 00:13:24,498
- [All] Ooh!

345
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:27,498
(Muffled crosstalk)

346
00:13:28,454 --> 00:13:31,204
(mystical music)

347
00:13:34,288 --> 00:13:36,024
- Guys, look at that.

348
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:36,989
What is that?

349
00:13:36,989 --> 00:13:38,251
(Chad coughing)

350
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:39,263
- Comin' from?

351
00:13:39,263 --> 00:13:41,096
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

352
00:13:43,566 --> 00:13:45,399
- Welcome to Stage 17!

353
00:13:46,277 --> 00:13:48,629
(All cheering)

354
00:13:48,629 --> 00:13:51,500
So many great films shot right here.

355
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:54,773
Madigan, clear this space.

356
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,600
- Can I get a hand?

357
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,851
- Where's my camera bag?
- I got it.

358
00:13:59,851 --> 00:14:00,702
(Muffled crosstalk)

359
00:14:00,702 --> 00:14:01,856
- Comin' through, excuse me.

360
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:04,630
- Yeah, I heard you.
- Thank you very much.

361
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:05,980
- Where's prop services?

362
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:09,277
- Yes, right over there.

363
00:14:09,277 --> 00:14:12,324
- [Ollie] All you'll do (mumbles).

364
00:14:12,324 --> 00:14:13,650
- You wanna help me with
somethin', sweetcheeks?

365
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,553
- [Chad] Oh, sure.

366
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,533
- What's that?

367
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:19,850
- I bought digicam to
document this historic event.

368
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:21,370
- Great idea, Ollie!

369
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,203
- Thank you.

370
00:14:22,203 --> 00:14:23,192
Who is the man?

371
00:14:23,192 --> 00:14:24,907
- Can I see that?
- Of course, dudie.

372
00:14:28,517 --> 00:14:30,365
- Sexy, isn't it? (Chuckles)

373
00:14:30,365 --> 00:14:32,312
You like that?

374
00:14:32,312 --> 00:14:34,130
- Oh shit, we have no batteries.

375
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:34,990
- What?
- Wait.

376
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:36,130
No no no, I packed them.

377
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,963
- There's no mistake.

378
00:14:36,963 --> 00:14:38,690
There is no batteries in here.

379
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:39,860
- Dude, get the camera out of here.

380
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,014
- Chad, would you please
go study your lines?

381
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:43,847
(Chad mumbling)

382
00:14:43,847 --> 00:14:45,790
- I wish I could help, but
I don't know what to do.

383
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,030
I'm just an actress.

384
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:48,440
- A monster?

385
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,510
I'm afraid.

386
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,360
- The batteries are in
here, I know they are.

387
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,260
Shit.

388
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,040
- No, they are not in here.

389
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:55,333
Do you wish to insult me?

390
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,166
(Muffled shouting)

391
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,630
- No one's insulting anyone.

392
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,200
Gary, where are they, Gary?

393
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,850
- I swear I brought them.

394
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,070
- I can't fuck with this bastard

395
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,570
if he continues to insult me.

396
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,910
- Please do not kill me.

397
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:08,660
- Chad, what are you doing?

398
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:10,680
- Practicing my lines.

399
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,772
- Here they are.

400
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:13,720
- (Mumbles) magic, very funny.

401
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,790
- C'mon people, (claps)
we got a film to shoot.

402
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,030
- Shoot it with your gun

403
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:18,972
now!

404
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,980
- Chad, please!

405
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,493
Go study your lines somewhere else.

406
00:15:32,654 --> 00:15:34,480
- I found one.
- What?

407
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,650
- Look.
- Cockroach!

408
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:38,030
- No, it's a bullet hole.

409
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:42,880
Justin Kirkpatrick was killed
right here in this very spot.

410
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,860
It's sacred.

411
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,720
- Jesus, get a therapist, will you?

412
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,810
- Steve, where do the actors changE?

413
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:51,900
- There's a dressing room across the hall.

414
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,547
Okay ladies, let's go.

415
00:15:55,448 --> 00:15:56,281
- When's lunch?

416
00:15:56,281 --> 00:15:57,114
I need to eat.

417
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,763
- Portia, we haven't even
got much time sweetheart.

418
00:16:03,848 --> 00:16:06,848
(Muffled crosstalk)

419
00:16:08,694 --> 00:16:10,611
- Alright, here we are.

420
00:16:12,008 --> 00:16:12,841
- Look.

421
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:18,210
I wonder if Justin wore
any of these clothes.

422
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:19,784
- Yeah maybe, just look
for the bullet holes.

423
00:16:19,784 --> 00:16:22,550
- I am not wearing any of this stuff.

424
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,550
- You don't have to.

425
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,015
- Does everybody have clean underwear?

426
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:28,848
- What?

427
00:16:28,848 --> 00:16:29,820
- You're gonna be in your
underwear most of the time.

428
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,900
- But I don't wear underwear.

429
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,530
- Don't worry, I brought
some extra just in case.

430
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,050
- So what do you think?

431
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:34,883
- It's you.

432
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,040
- Okay, let's all get dressed.

433
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,830
- Candyce, are you ready?

434
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,960
- Yeah, uh huh.

435
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,050
- What's that?

436
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:43,653
- It's my scrapbook on Justin.

437
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:45,920
- God, I love him.

438
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,230
Such a tragedy.

439
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,450
- They say it was an accident.

440
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,850
Nobody was murdered.

441
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,950
- That's the man.

442
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,100
That's the man that killed
my Justin, Daryl James.

443
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,843
He did, he killed my Justin.

444
00:16:58,581 --> 00:17:01,430
- She's just a good actress.

445
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:03,296
- There's somethin' behind you.

446
00:17:03,296 --> 00:17:06,343
No!
- Chad, Chad, Chad!

447
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:11,823
Go to another room far away, please?

448
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,320
- It's dark out there and there's spi--

449
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:21,030
- Find a room, turn on the lights,

450
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,180
close the door and I'll find
you when I need you, alright?

451
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,643
- Okay,

452
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:32,983
sir.

453
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,120
Bye, Ollie.

454
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:38,953
- Bye bye.

455
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,388
Chad is quite friendly
fellow, would you think?

456
00:17:43,388 --> 00:17:44,440
He's great actor.

457
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,572
One day superstar, win Oscar.

458
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:49,072
(Eerie music)

459
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,752
(eerie growling)

460
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:06,630
(door creaking)

461
00:18:17,586 --> 00:18:22,586
(praying mantis screeching)
(Chad screaming)

462
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,211
- Sorry.
- I wasn't scared.

463
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,711
(Eerie music)

464
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,113
- You okay?

465
00:18:37,005 --> 00:18:38,018
- Anybody have any scissors?

466
00:18:38,018 --> 00:18:38,893
Does anybody have scissors?

467
00:18:38,893 --> 00:18:39,923
- I think I might.

468
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:43,835
(Foreboding music)

469
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,490
- Hey, get outta here!
- Oh my god, stop that.

470
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,768
What are you doing?

471
00:18:54,768 --> 00:18:55,860
Some of your nipples are showing.

472
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:57,730
- Ollie, what the hell do
you think you're doing?

473
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:59,880
- I am making super-duper documentary.

474
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,208
- Document this.

475
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,358
- Very real.

476
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:03,318
Very real.

477
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:04,151
- What about this?

478
00:19:04,151 --> 00:19:04,984
(Muffled shouting)

479
00:19:04,984 --> 00:19:05,973
- Ollie, get out.

480
00:19:07,117 --> 00:19:07,950
- I'm going.

481
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,570
I will to tell you we want
you on set to take you.

482
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:12,500
- We'll be right there.

483
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,370
Okay?

484
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,203
Good.

485
00:19:15,585 --> 00:19:18,850
- Document my ass.
- Thank you, I will.

486
00:19:18,850 --> 00:19:19,683
- Get out.

487
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,990
- Hey, where'd you get that?

488
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,690
- From your scrapbook.

489
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:31,760
- Give it back.

490
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,310
- Gary?
- Ready.

491
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:36,210
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

492
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,480
- Naughty Sex Kittens versus
the Giant Praying Mantis.

493
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,683
Scene one, take one.

494
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,276
- Action!

495
00:19:43,276 --> 00:19:44,109
- Cut!

496
00:19:44,109 --> 00:19:44,960
- Cut?

497
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,110
Portia, never ever say
cut to the director.

498
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,860
Not on my set, what's wrong with you?

499
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,260
- I wanna take a break.

500
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,230
- We haven't even started yet.

501
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:53,820
- But I'm thirsty!

502
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,210
- Just finish the scene then
you can take a break, okay?

503
00:19:58,210 --> 00:20:02,120
- Okay, but I'm working under protest.

504
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,663
- Roll camera.
- Rolling.

505
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,383
- Action!

506
00:20:07,383 --> 00:20:10,170
- Oh great spirits of the underworld,

507
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:14,660
we call upon you to show
yourself in flesh and blood.

508
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,073
Repeat after me.

509
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:21,073
(Women chanting)
(eerie music)

510
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:48,827
- (gasps) Oh gentle fair one, we see you.

511
00:20:48,827 --> 00:20:49,787
- Oh my god, it's Justin!

512
00:20:49,787 --> 00:20:52,090
(Sinister music)

513
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,817
- Tell me you got that.

514
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:56,250
- I got it.

515
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,700
- It was, it was Justin.

516
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,340
It really was, just like you said.

517
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,647
- I told you.

518
00:21:00,647 --> 00:21:02,840
Did you see anything?
- No, I saw something.

519
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,890
- Think my eyes are playing tricks on me.

520
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:06,633
- Justin.

521
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,253
I saw you.

522
00:21:13,512 --> 00:21:14,870
I know you're here.

523
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,230
- Did you have anything to do with it?

524
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,200
- Not a bloody thing.

525
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,703
- Can we take a break now?

526
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,930
- Shit, the security guards.

527
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:24,383
Kevin quick, cut the lights.

528
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,373
Gary, Gary.

529
00:21:29,062 --> 00:21:31,726
(Lights clunking)
(ominous music)

530
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,726
(crickets chirping)

531
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:41,271
I hope he didn't see anything.

532
00:21:41,271 --> 00:21:44,163
Madigan, you have got to watch the time.

533
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,370
- You guys, where's Chad?

534
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:53,120
- Don't turn around, something behind you.

535
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:53,953
Run.

536
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:59,043
Don't turn around.

537
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,393
There is something behind you.

538
00:22:04,009 --> 00:22:04,842
Run.

539
00:22:06,843 --> 00:22:09,926
(Ominous whispering)

540
00:22:22,024 --> 00:22:24,774
(eominous music)

541
00:22:30,927 --> 00:22:33,196
There's something behind you.

542
00:22:33,196 --> 00:22:34,310
Run.

543
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,120
Don't turn around.

544
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,553
There's somethin' behind you, run!

545
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:40,791
(Film whirring)

546
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,624
- You're okay?
- Hey,

547
00:22:41,624 --> 00:22:42,530
you guys want a strawberry (mumbles)?

548
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:43,980
- She wants a beer (mumbles).

549
00:22:45,167 --> 00:22:46,413
- Yeah right, we'll be back.

550
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:52,778
(Car horn honking)

551
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:00,030
(woman screaming)
(ominous music)

552
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:08,022
(Chad screaming and grunting)
(pickax slashing)

553
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:12,716
- (whimpers) No, no!

554
00:23:12,716 --> 00:23:17,716
(Chad screaming)
(blood spattering)

555
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:23,387
- You guys, what was that?

556
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,300
- Chad.

557
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,510
- Was that real?

558
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:31,400
- No he's doing his
lines badly, I might add.

559
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,140
Madigan, come with me.

560
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:35,473
Remember, no lights.

561
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,743
- I wonder where they're going. (Chuckles)

562
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:47,826
(ominous music)

563
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:55,860
- Steve, where are we going?

564
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:02,077
- This way.

565
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:07,817
- I can't see.
- Neither can I.

566
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,233
There he is, right on schedule.

567
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,803
I need you to keep watch.

568
00:24:23,939 --> 00:24:26,893
- You want me to stay up
here in the dark all alone?

569
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,573
- Yeah, that's right.

570
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,583
- Forget it.

571
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:43,811
- (Laughs maniacally) I have heard of

572
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:46,210
(mumbles) combinations.

573
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,740
- C'mon everyone, no lounging around.

574
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:50,130
We got a film to make.

575
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,430
C'mon everyone, let's get set up.

576
00:24:51,430 --> 00:24:53,990
This is the romantic scene.

577
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:54,930
Get the lights!

578
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,660
- So how was it?

579
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,540
- Will someone please find Chad?

580
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,563
Madigan?
- Where is he?

581
00:25:00,563 --> 00:25:02,483
- I don't know, find him.

582
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,740
Where's the tent?

583
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,573
Where's the bloody tent?

584
00:25:05,573 --> 00:25:07,115
We had it right here.

585
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:07,948
- Chad?

586
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,693
Chad?

587
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,873
You're needed on set.

588
00:25:17,302 --> 00:25:22,302
(Ghastly whispering)
(eerie music)

589
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,520
Chad, is that you?

590
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:29,912
Chad?

591
00:25:29,912 --> 00:25:34,912
(Books crumbling)
(Madigan yelping)

592
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:51,782
Chad?

593
00:25:51,782 --> 00:25:54,449
(Intense music)

594
00:25:55,427 --> 00:25:58,260
(Madigan wincing)

595
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,590
- C'mon people, we still
got seven more pages to fill

596
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,700
in this hour block and we've
only got 34 minutes left.

597
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,533
Hustle up!

598
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:06,366
- I can't find Chad.

599
00:26:06,366 --> 00:26:07,430
- Go look again.

600
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,280
- I have to do makeup.

601
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,900
- Did you look everywhere?

602
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,390
- No, the place is too big.

603
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:12,223
- Let's hope he left.

604
00:26:12,223 --> 00:26:13,056
He wasn't very good.

605
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:14,893
- Fucking actors!

606
00:26:14,893 --> 00:26:16,458
Alright, we can film around it.

607
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:18,366
- He's the lead.

608
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:19,410
- We'll have to make due without him.

609
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,950
- Hey Steve, I could do it!

610
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,430
- Right, Ollie.

611
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,700
- Yes?
- Come here.

612
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:28,397
You, my friend, are
now Hamilton (mumbles).

613
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,000
- Goodie gumdrops.

614
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,210
I am now big gonad like daddy (mumbles).

615
00:26:33,210 --> 00:26:34,860
- Wait, who's gonna do sound?

616
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,290
- Ooh good.

617
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,143
- Madigan?

618
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,450
- Where's Chad?

619
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:41,310
- I think he went home.

620
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,840
- If I wasn't such a committed actress,

621
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,200
I'd be right behind him.

622
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,373
- Quiet please, quiet!

623
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,683
- And--
- I have to pee.

624
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,343
- Not now.

625
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,210
- Okay, I'll just pee in the tent then.

626
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:02,453
- And action.

627
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,647
- Tanya, I've waited so long
to caress your firm bootay.

628
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,407
- Oh Hamilton, I've missed you so.

629
00:27:13,395 --> 00:27:15,480
- But Darlin', where are the others?

630
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,410
- I sneaked out of the slumber party

631
00:27:17,410 --> 00:27:18,510
while they wasn't lookin'.

632
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,050
- Ooh, you naughty minx.

633
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,710
I long to mount your molten milk jugs.

634
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,793
- Ooh, I long for you.

635
00:27:29,632 --> 00:27:32,299
(Both grunting)

636
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:35,140
- Who's your daddy?

637
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,311
- Take me, take me!

638
00:27:37,311 --> 00:27:38,366
Take me, Hamilton.
- I will!

639
00:27:38,366 --> 00:27:39,420
(Portia squealing)

640
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,436
Come on.
- Stop it!

641
00:27:40,436 --> 00:27:42,290
- God what the fuck was that, Portia?

642
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,160
- He's tryin' to take my top off.

643
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,833
- That's what the script calls for.

644
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,060
- I would very much like
to do that scene again.

645
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,330
- I don't care, I will not do nudity

646
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:50,240
unless I get paid for it.

647
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,340
- I got a quarter.

648
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,420
- Is that what you get paid?

649
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,363
- No, but it would be a pay raise for you.

650
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,392
- [Steve] Okay, who wants
to stand in for Portia?

651
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:58,225
- (Slaps) Jerk.

652
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,058
(Ollie yelping)

653
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:00,590
- How long would I have to stand for?

654
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,610
- I will.

655
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,110
- What?

656
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:03,943
Darlene?

657
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,151
- I'd love to.

658
00:28:07,151 --> 00:28:08,651
- I feel distress.

659
00:28:13,647 --> 00:28:14,730
- And action.

660
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:18,255
(Intriguing carnival music)

661
00:28:18,255 --> 00:28:20,074
(both grunting)

662
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,431
- Take me, take me.
- Yes!

663
00:28:21,431 --> 00:28:22,660
- Oh Hamilton, take me.

664
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,897
- I wouldn't lie to you.
- Oh, take me.

665
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:25,740
- I goin' to bite you.

666
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,530
Ooh yes, come on.

667
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:29,340
- Cut, brilliant!

668
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,010
- Exceptionally sorry for the--

669
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,768
- It's alright.

670
00:28:32,768 --> 00:28:34,500
- This will edit nicely.

671
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,960
Now let's finish the scene.

672
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,030
Where's Portia?

673
00:28:37,030 --> 00:28:38,033
Portia?

674
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,493
Portia.

675
00:28:40,493 --> 00:28:42,120
- I'm very upset.

676
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,300
- What's wrong?

677
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,133
Talk to me.

678
00:28:44,133 --> 00:28:45,773
- I have a chemical imbalance.

679
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,250
- Here, take a couple of these.

680
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:50,150
They'll relax you.

681
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:52,799
Here.

682
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,913
- What are they?

683
00:28:54,913 --> 00:28:57,490
- It's Somadome or something like that.

684
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:58,323
I don't remember.

685
00:28:58,323 --> 00:28:59,983
All I know is I'd explode without them.

686
00:29:01,295 --> 00:29:02,295
- I need some water.

687
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,418
- There we are.

688
00:29:06,418 --> 00:29:07,418
There we go.

689
00:29:08,397 --> 00:29:09,480
There we are.

690
00:29:15,096 --> 00:29:16,960
(Portia coughing)

691
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:20,193
Take a minute, then come back alright?

692
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:23,540
(Mumbles) sweet.

693
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,480
Portia, Portia?

694
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,313
Portia.

695
00:29:28,803 --> 00:29:31,673
Look, you're the best
actress I've ever seen.

696
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:34,820
Even better than Madonna.

697
00:29:38,155 --> 00:29:38,988
- I know.

698
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,613
(Somber music)

699
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,663
(man grunting)

700
00:30:00,613 --> 00:30:02,110
- And action.

701
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:05,160
- Ooh Tanya, I long to
pounce on the package

702
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,553
of your pulsating action.

703
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:08,670
- The room is spinning.

704
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,580
- Daddy has (mumbles).

705
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,030
I think there's someone outside.

706
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:13,643
- Hello.
- Hello.

707
00:30:13,643 --> 00:30:15,393
There you are, Tanya.

708
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,004
We were looking for you
at the slumber party.

709
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:22,120
(Gasps) Who is your friend?

710
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,260
- I'm Hamilton Bigfoot III.

711
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,830
Hello, join me in my tent of love.

712
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:30,070
- I'd love to.

713
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,592
- That's it, lovely lovely.

714
00:30:31,592 --> 00:30:32,867
Room for more.

715
00:30:32,867 --> 00:30:33,700
Hello.

716
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:38,318
- C'mon in, girls.
- Come to Papa.

717
00:30:38,318 --> 00:30:40,360
- What are we doing?

718
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,947
- I'm in a bad place.

719
00:30:41,947 --> 00:30:45,115
(Muffled crosstalk)

720
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:46,464
Perfect, lovely.
- Sorry.

721
00:30:46,464 --> 00:30:50,297
(Intense investigative music)

722
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,040
- Good, let's get to the exit shots

723
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,260
so we can set up the (mumbles) sequence.

724
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,400
Madigan, how much time?

725
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,720
- Two minutes, better shut it down now.

726
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,880
- No no, we've got time.

727
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,210
Roll camera and--

728
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,210
- What are we doing?

729
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,390
- Just climb out of the tent.

730
00:31:18,390 --> 00:31:21,723
Everyone else stay put and go!

731
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,150
- Now?

732
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:25,983
- Yes, now.

733
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:26,863
Go go go!

734
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:29,170
- Me?

735
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,097
- Shit, Candyce you just climb
outta the tent fast and go!

736
00:31:34,439 --> 00:31:36,652
(Candyce chuckling)

737
00:31:36,652 --> 00:31:37,485
Cut!

738
00:31:37,485 --> 00:31:38,318
Brilliant, turn off the lights.

739
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:39,151
The flashlights as well.

740
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:39,984
Move it, move it.

741
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,170
(Lights clunking)

742
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,577
- Candyce, where you goin'?

743
00:31:46,577 --> 00:31:47,963
- I'm goin' to see Justin.

744
00:31:49,812 --> 00:31:51,082
- Hey, hey, hey.

745
00:31:51,082 --> 00:31:51,915
What are you doin'?

746
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:52,812
- You don't have to hit me,

747
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:54,612
I was only tryin' to stretch my arm.

748
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,770
- She's gone over the edge.

749
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:00,603
- She's great.

750
00:32:00,603 --> 00:32:03,220
Maybe it'll help her performance.

751
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,203
- Justin?

752
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,633
Justin.

753
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,693
Where are you, Justin?

754
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:14,788
Justin, I'm looking for you.

755
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:17,705
(Foreboding music)

756
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,609
(Portia farting)

757
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,059
- Dammit!
- Getting out of here.

758
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:29,309
- Eww.
- Eww, that's stinky.

759
00:32:31,094 --> 00:32:33,700
- It was not me, I am going to (mumbles).

760
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,600
- It must've been Portia.

761
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,110
She's the only one still in there.

762
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,421
- It doesn't smell like a girl did it.

763
00:32:38,421 --> 00:32:40,000
- Portia?
- Portia.

764
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,453
- Oh my god, the smell killed her.

765
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,117
- Jesus Christ.

766
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,103
Portia.

767
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,780
Portia, wake up.

768
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,020
Portia, Portia.

769
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,437
- What's wrong, Steve?

770
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,240
- She's sleeping.

771
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,410
She's probably tired or something.

772
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:01,690
- She must've been real
tired to sleep through that.

773
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,700
- Be nice.

774
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,740
She told me she had some
sort of chemical imbalance.

775
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,453
Probably makes her tired.

776
00:33:06,453 --> 00:33:08,060
Kevin, get her outta the the tent.

777
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,050
We're gonna need it.

778
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,943
- Yeah okay, sure.

779
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,133
- Justin, where are you?

780
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,189
Come to me, baby.

781
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:23,189
(Light comical music)
(ghastly whispering)

782
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,314
Right.

783
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:34,364
When I went to the Chinese man's theater,

784
00:33:35,915 --> 00:33:37,113
I saw your hand print.

785
00:33:39,551 --> 00:33:41,390
I put my hand there, Justin.

786
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:43,033
I placed it in your print.

787
00:33:44,470 --> 00:33:46,790
You're not gonna believe
this, but it fit perfectly.

788
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,790
It fit perfect.

789
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:51,411
It was a perfect, perfect match.

790
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:55,886
(Eerie music)
(stairs creaking)

791
00:33:55,886 --> 00:33:59,136
Plus I needed to come here and tell you

792
00:34:00,737 --> 00:34:05,737
I've been dreaming about you (mumbles).

793
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,660
I've collected everything
of yours from the scrapbook

794
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,910
from the beginning of
your career to the end.

795
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:16,989
Madigan, he's here.

796
00:34:16,989 --> 00:34:17,889
He's here.

797
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,512
He's physically here in his physical form.

798
00:34:20,512 --> 00:34:22,914
I can see him, I can hear him.

799
00:34:22,914 --> 00:34:25,940
He's walking around me.

800
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,043
Do you hear him?

801
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:30,279
Ssh, listen.

802
00:34:30,279 --> 00:34:31,946
I'm serious, listen.

803
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,580
Alright, fine.

804
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,020
You don't believe he's here, that's fine.

805
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,850
What's the next scene?

806
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,213
What do we have to do?

807
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,613
- We have to get back
'cause we're almost ready.

808
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:47,380
Why don't you come along?

809
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,443
- You think I'm nuts, don't you?

810
00:34:49,443 --> 00:34:53,350
- No, I just don't think you
should be here all by yourself.

811
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,700
- I'm not by myself at all.

812
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,813
I got my Justin.

813
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:07,890
I got my Justin.

814
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,370
- Here we go, nice.

815
00:35:11,370 --> 00:35:12,470
Easy does it.

816
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,387
Easy, okay.

817
00:35:15,162 --> 00:35:15,995
Alright, sweetheart.

818
00:35:15,995 --> 00:35:19,093
- It's called acting from the outside in.

819
00:35:19,093 --> 00:35:21,900
I think for your scene
you should use this face.

820
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,050
- That one right there?

821
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,490
Like this?

822
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,811
- Oh my god, that's so good.
- You like that?

823
00:35:25,811 --> 00:35:27,250
- Have you done this before?

824
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,080
- No, but I've done this one. (Moans)

825
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,963
- I don't see that one on here.

826
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,130
- Alright chief, we're
onto the fantasy sequence.

827
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,240
- Wait, where?

828
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,390
- Company move.

829
00:35:36,390 --> 00:35:37,590
- What fantasy sequence?

830
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,590
- Script revision.

831
00:35:40,590 --> 00:35:42,780
No dialogue, won't take long.

832
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,258
(Relaxing rhythmic music)

833
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:47,858
C'mon everybody, right this way.

834
00:35:51,011 --> 00:35:51,928
Here it is.

835
00:35:53,901 --> 00:35:54,880
Here it is.

836
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,253
Ollie, Gary!

837
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,600
- Touch me again and I'll kick your ass.

838
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,174
- Mind of its own.

839
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:03,530
I can't control it, sorry.

840
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,363
- What's the bed for?

841
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,943
- It's a girl love scene.

842
00:36:07,401 --> 00:36:08,234
- Oh brother.

843
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:09,210
- Who's fantasy is this?

844
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,680
- It represents the changing nature

845
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,180
of the duality of the human animal.

846
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,823
Trust me, you'll understand
once it's edited in.

847
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:17,990
- Sounds like bullshit.

848
00:36:19,224 --> 00:36:21,430
- You wouldn't understand, it's art.

849
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,930
- Right here, light it low Gary.

850
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,010
- I would very much like to
be in lesbian love scene.

851
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,340
- I need two actresses for this.

852
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,310
- Count me out.

853
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:29,300
- I'll do it.

854
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,870
- Not you.

855
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,770
Darlene?

856
00:36:31,770 --> 00:36:32,603
- Sure, what the hell?

857
00:36:32,603 --> 00:36:33,607
I'll do it.

858
00:36:33,607 --> 00:36:34,700
- Come here, sweetie.

859
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,420
- Candyce?
- Want to get down with brown?

860
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,480
- Candyce?

861
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,517
- No I don't think Justin
would like that, would you?

862
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,173
- Rebecca?

863
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:45,006
- Steve, c'mon.

864
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:47,700
- You just shoot the pictures, Gary.

865
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,511
Rebecca, sweetheart.

866
00:36:49,511 --> 00:36:50,360
- Why do I have to do it?

867
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,593
Why can't Ollie do it?

868
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,702
- Tell me when this is done.

869
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:57,300
- Lemme talk to you for just one second.

870
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,900
- I just don't know how this
could be good for my career.

871
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,733
- What are you talking about?

872
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:01,910
This could be the best thing

873
00:37:01,910 --> 00:37:03,930
that has happened to your career.

874
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,340
- How can that be?

875
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,670
- Truest test of an actor is when an actor

876
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,830
has to play a role that
is in direct opposite

877
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,483
to that actor's real character.

878
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,543
- You mean if I had to play a man,

879
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:17,513
then it would make me a better actress?

880
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:18,520
- Exactly!

881
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,780
You hit the nail on the head.

882
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:23,110
In this scene, the giant
mantis has you so terrified

883
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,263
that you take solace in
the arms of another woman.

884
00:37:26,263 --> 00:37:30,570
You are like a man making
love to that woman.

885
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,853
- But I don't have a--

886
00:37:32,853 --> 00:37:34,650
- It doesn't matter just as long,

887
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:37,039
sweetheart, as you believe it.

888
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,300
Nobody will notice.

889
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,133
- Ooh,

890
00:37:41,404 --> 00:37:42,237
I get it.

891
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,130
Okay, I'll do it.

892
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,130
- That's the spirit.

893
00:37:52,255 --> 00:37:55,088
(Darlene purring)

894
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:56,943
And action.

895
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,250
Rebecca, go over to Darlene.

896
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,671
That's nice.

897
00:38:01,671 --> 00:38:02,504
There we go.

898
00:38:02,504 --> 00:38:04,968
Darlene, (mumbles), there we are.

899
00:38:04,968 --> 00:38:05,801
Kiss her.

900
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:12,049
Good, good.

901
00:38:12,049 --> 00:38:14,799
Slowly bring her down to the bed.

902
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:20,772
There we are.

903
00:38:20,772 --> 00:38:25,605
(Darlene and Rebecca pleasurably moaning)

904
00:38:26,906 --> 00:38:30,436
(Steve drowned by music)

905
00:38:30,436 --> 00:38:31,269
- Right there, right there.

906
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:34,269
Take her (mumbles).

907
00:38:35,391 --> 00:38:39,859
(Rebecca and Darlene moaning loudly)

908
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,442
(Steve drowned by moaning)

909
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:57,014
(Madigan drowned out by moaning)

910
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:07,824
Cut!

911
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:30,562
(Darlene and Rebecca breathing heavily)

912
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:41,806
(soft, romantic music)

913
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:47,640
- Oops, wrong way.

914
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:57,123
(Chanting in foreign language)

915
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:08,897
(ghastly whispering)
(foreboding music)

916
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,720
(bats fluttering)
(Trish screaming)

917
00:41:07,901 --> 00:41:08,984
- Jeez, fuck!

918
00:41:14,208 --> 00:41:19,208
(Water trickling)
(both chuckling)

919
00:41:21,781 --> 00:41:26,781
(door squeaking)
(ominous music)

920
00:41:28,831 --> 00:41:31,591
(both yelping)

921
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:32,424
- You scared us.

922
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:34,864
- Sorry, we need you two back on set.

923
00:41:34,864 --> 00:41:37,624
- Alright we'll hurry, won't we? (Laughs)

924
00:41:37,624 --> 00:41:41,451
- Sure. (Giggles)

925
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:44,534
(soft sensual music)

926
00:41:46,622 --> 00:41:48,322
- (chuckles) Okay, alright Portia.

927
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:53,320
Gonna have to move this a
little bit here, there we go.

928
00:41:54,384 --> 00:41:55,591
Nice and easy.

929
00:41:55,591 --> 00:41:58,372
(Kevin mumbling)

930
00:41:58,372 --> 00:41:59,205
Gotcha.

931
00:42:04,807 --> 00:42:05,890
Oh god, okay.

932
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:13,320
Oh god, this is strangely arousing.

933
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,220
Reminds me of seventh grade gym class.

934
00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:20,023
Oh, can I get a towel please?

935
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,460
- I'm getting the creeps in here.

936
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:30,960
- You getting the creeps?

937
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,140
- I keep hearin' noises like somebody else

938
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,153
is in here with us.

939
00:42:35,416 --> 00:42:36,566
- Me, too.
- You, too?

940
00:42:37,413 --> 00:42:41,150
- There's so much film history.

941
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:43,840
If I concentrate, I can hear the sounds

942
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,460
of all the horror films gone by.

943
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:48,460
It's like we're invoking the spirits

944
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,980
of all these dead filmmakers.

945
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:53,440
It will permeate the fabric of the story

946
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,180
and get into the blood of my film!

947
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,450
- Video.

948
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,393
- Yeah, whatever.

949
00:43:00,277 --> 00:43:02,023
Okay, are we ready?

950
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,413
Where's everybody at?

951
00:43:05,605 --> 00:43:06,610
Goddammit, late again.

952
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,513
Kevin quick, cut the lights.

953
00:43:10,923 --> 00:43:12,587
(Lights buzzing)

954
00:43:12,587 --> 00:43:13,910
- (snorts) Huh?

955
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,093
- We're gonna get caught.

956
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:16,136
He's already makin' his rounds.

957
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,635
- Where the hell is Madigan?

958
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:18,955
- I thought it was this way,

959
00:43:18,955 --> 00:43:21,120
but it all looks the same to me now.

960
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:21,953
Oh wait.

961
00:43:21,953 --> 00:43:22,786
- Whoa!

962
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:26,837
- Oh my god, Rebecca.

963
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,670
Check this out.
- Wow.

964
00:43:32,097 --> 00:43:33,549
- Oh my god, check this out.

965
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:34,600
- Wow.
- This is so cool.

966
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,155
- Ooh cool.

967
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,690
- Oh my god.
- Look at--

968
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:40,997
- Oh my god, I haven't seen one of these.

969
00:43:43,176 --> 00:43:45,237
- Oh look at this.

970
00:43:45,237 --> 00:43:46,913
(Tape whirring)

971
00:43:46,913 --> 00:43:47,913
Cool.
- Woo!

972
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,433
- Yeah.

973
00:43:51,364 --> 00:43:52,750
- You shouldn't have done that to Rebecca.

974
00:43:52,750 --> 00:43:53,730
You know she's not very smart.

975
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:54,670
You took advantage of her.

976
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,880
- Gary, the process of filmmaking

977
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,320
is a process of discovery.

978
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,920
Rebecca made a discovery tonight.

979
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:04,500
It's a beautiful thing.

980
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,630
- I do completely agree with you, Steve.

981
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:08,942
I, too, want to discover her boobies.

982
00:44:08,942 --> 00:44:13,942
(Honky-tonk music)
(both chuckling)

983
00:44:14,172 --> 00:44:15,005
- Cool.

984
00:44:16,344 --> 00:44:17,448

987
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,393

- Ooh, what the--

1055
00:47:47,347 --> 00:47:48,760
- I can't believe you did that to me.

1056
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,270
You're such an asshole.

1057
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,477
(Rhythmic music)

1058
00:47:52,477 --> 00:47:54,420
You keep your filthy hands off of me.

1059
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,823
- Not my fault.

1060
00:47:55,823 --> 00:47:57,304
Hey!

1061
00:47:57,304 --> 00:47:58,463
- Where the hell have you been?

1062
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:00,493
- Steve.

1063
00:48:00,493 --> 00:48:01,787
- We went three minutes past the hour.

1064
00:48:01,787 --> 00:48:04,480
The security guard was already
makin' his bloody rounds.

1065
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,010
You should've been here to tell me.

1066
00:48:06,010 --> 00:48:07,240
- You have a watch.

1067
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:08,073
- Whatever.

1068
00:48:08,073 --> 00:48:09,443
Kevin, get the lights.

1069
00:48:13,067 --> 00:48:14,580
Where's Rebecca and Darlene?

1070
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:16,032
- They were showering.

1071
00:48:16,032 --> 00:48:16,865
- Go get them!

1072
00:48:16,865 --> 00:48:18,440
- I will be really happy to get them.

1073
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,140
- Shit no, you stay here.

1074
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,700
- I have a feeling they'll be a while.

1075
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:24,240
- Why?!

1076
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,150
- I don't think they were
done enjoying themselves.

1077
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,640
- Jesus, nice goin' Steve.

1078
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:31,473
- Fuck it.

1079
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:32,306
Alright, alright.

1080
00:48:32,306 --> 00:48:33,139
Who do I have?

1081
00:48:33,139 --> 00:48:35,195
- Candyce, Trish and me.

1082
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:36,517
- Not you.

1083
00:48:36,517 --> 00:48:40,110
Fuck, how can I have
five girls go into a tent

1084
00:48:40,110 --> 00:48:41,827
and only two come out?!

1085
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,420
Kevin, wake up Portia.

1086
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,870
- Portia, Portia.

1087
00:48:46,870 --> 00:48:48,110
Gotta come back.
- I wanna sleep.

1088
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,150
- Steve wants you back on set.

1089
00:48:49,150 --> 00:48:50,245
Come on.

1090
00:48:50,245 --> 00:48:51,078
(Hand slapping)

1091
00:48:51,078 --> 00:48:51,911
Oh!

1092
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:55,600
She ain't comin' back, Steve.

1093
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,600
- I'll make three.

1094
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,010
- I said no.

1095
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:00,023
Go get Rebecca and Darlene right now.

1096
00:49:00,970 --> 00:49:01,803
- No.

1097
00:49:03,147 --> 00:49:04,000
- What?
- No!

1098
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,210
No more Rebecca.

1099
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:07,470
I'll even take the camera with me.

1100
00:49:07,470 --> 00:49:09,460
- You just shoot, Gary.

1101
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,120
I'm the director and I make the decisions.

1102
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:13,953
- Try me.

1103
00:49:13,953 --> 00:49:16,540
- Steve, why don't you let Madigan do it?

1104
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,963
- Who's gonna do sound?

1105
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,510
- C'mon, lemme do it.

1106
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,120
I don't mind being naked.

1107
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:25,723
- Nobody wants to see you naked!

1108
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,010
- I am one person who would
like to see her butt-naked.

1109
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,450
- Shut up!

1110
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:37,330
Trish, go get Candyce.

1111
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:39,030
C'mon, (claps) let's go, let's go!

1112
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:43,773
Portia.

1113
00:49:44,870 --> 00:49:47,420
She can sleep all she wants,
we just need her body.

1114
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,400
Kevin, go get her.

1115
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,233
- Okay.

1116
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:53,717
- Putting on the buttocks.

1117
00:49:53,717 --> 00:49:56,080
Ass first, ass first.

1118
00:49:56,080 --> 00:49:58,520
Ooh, me so horny.
- Ooh yeah, there you go.

1119
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,430
- Come on.
- You get her?

1120
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:00,860
- I am (mumbles), oh god.

1121
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,010
- Is that good for you?

1122
00:50:04,654 --> 00:50:06,334
- Where is Madigan?

1123
00:50:06,334 --> 00:50:10,571
(Sensual saxophone music)

1124
00:50:10,571 --> 00:50:11,404
- Yes.

1125
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:15,010
- Who's gonna do sound?

1126
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:17,430
- Be a true independent filmmaker.

1127
00:50:17,430 --> 00:50:19,450
Go (mumbles) 95 using existing sound

1128
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,380
that the camera mic picks up.

1129
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:22,213
- Alright.

1130
00:50:23,441 --> 00:50:25,716
(Singers vocalizing)
(sensual music)

1131
00:50:25,716 --> 00:50:27,443
C'mon Candyce, right this way.

1132
00:50:27,443 --> 00:50:28,276
Here we are.

1133
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:30,109
C'mon sweetheart, yes.

1134
00:50:31,336 --> 00:50:33,358
Alright, where's the blood?

1135
00:50:33,358 --> 00:50:35,080
- In the tent.
- Great, great.

1136
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:39,220
Remember girls, look dead
when you're supposed to.

1137
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,080
Alright, inside the tent.

1138
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,320
Here we go, come on.

1139
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:43,083
Ladies, Kevin?

1140
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:44,867
- I am ready, Steve.

1141
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:45,733
- And action!

1142
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,608
(Praying mantis growling)

1143
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:52,520
- [Candyce] Ooh Hamilton,
you haven't had enough?

1144
00:50:53,437 --> 00:50:56,270
(Girls screaming)

1145
00:50:57,589 --> 00:50:59,922
- Don't stop, keep on goin'.

1146
00:51:04,809 --> 00:51:05,642
Cut!

1147
00:51:05,642 --> 00:51:07,790
That was brilliant!

1148
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:08,850
There we are.

1149
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:11,093
Take her outta the tent, just like that.

1150
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:13,213
Alrighty, that's it.

1151
00:51:13,213 --> 00:51:14,493
That's it, yes.

1152
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:17,287
You are taking her back to your lair.

1153
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:21,303
Remember, you are the
giant, evil praying mantis.

1154
00:51:24,106 --> 00:51:25,130
Continue on.

1155
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:27,120
Very good.

1156
00:51:28,409 --> 00:51:31,021
(Portia thudding and farting)

1157
00:51:31,021 --> 00:51:32,417
- Good, c'mon Portia help me out here.

1158
00:51:32,417 --> 00:51:34,401
- I'm so tired.

1159
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:36,244
- Oh god, Steve is such a jerk.

1160
00:51:36,244 --> 00:51:38,718
(Water trickling)

1161
00:51:38,718 --> 00:51:40,743
- (chuckles) That tickles.

1162
00:51:40,743 --> 00:51:42,028
I have to pee.

1163
00:51:42,028 --> 00:51:45,361
(Light accordion music)

1164
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:57,210
- Ooh shit.

1165
00:51:57,210 --> 00:51:58,157
- Ollie, what are you doing here?

1166
00:51:58,157 --> 00:51:59,980
- Excuse me, please.

1167
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,130
I'm only here because the
toilet is not working.

1168
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:03,461
Poo-poo will go everywhere.

1169
00:52:03,461 --> 00:52:04,861
- Get out, get out!
- Poo-poo is going everywhere.

1170
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:05,791
- Get out!

1171
00:52:05,791 --> 00:52:07,202
(Ollie mumbling)

1172
00:52:07,202 --> 00:52:10,923
Get out!

1173
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:13,980
- Here Madigan, you can put her head here.

1174
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:26,006
You're a good person, Madigan.

1175
00:52:26,006 --> 00:52:27,509
- At least somebody notices.

1176
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:28,342
- Yeah.

1177
00:52:28,342 --> 00:52:30,000
How'd you hook up with Steve anyway?

1178
00:52:31,036 --> 00:52:32,963
- We had an editing class together.

1179
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:38,120
- Hey look, here I may
be oversteppin' my bounds

1180
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,440
but he doesn't really seem

1181
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:42,780
to appreciate you for your talents.

1182
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,030
He's awfully mean to you.

1183
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,560
- I know.

1184
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,630
He won't even cast me
in one of his movies,

1185
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:52,186
but I guess he's the genius.

1186
00:52:52,186 --> 00:52:53,359
- Why do you say that?

1187
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:55,286
- Because he always tells me he is.

1188
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:56,846
Why would he lie? (Chuckles)

1189
00:52:56,846 --> 00:52:59,679
(Kevin chuckling)

1190
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:08,609
(Portia snoring)
(soft somber music)

1191
00:53:08,856 --> 00:53:10,189
- I am so sorry.

1192
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:12,149
- That's okay.

1193
00:53:12,149 --> 00:53:12,982
- I'm such a dork.

1194
00:53:12,982 --> 00:53:13,861
- No, that's okay.

1195
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,361
- [Steve] Madigan!

1196
00:53:20,749 --> 00:53:23,962
- (Grunts) Damn!

1197
00:53:23,962 --> 00:53:24,795
- Justin,

1198
00:53:26,999 --> 00:53:28,982
where are you?

1199
00:53:28,982 --> 00:53:30,815
- [Justin] Come to me.

1200
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,593
- Justin?
- Yes.

1201
00:53:36,471 --> 00:53:37,388
Come to me.

1202
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:41,480
- I'm comin' to you.

1203
00:53:41,480 --> 00:53:43,980
- Yes.
- You won't regret this.

1204
00:53:45,613 --> 00:53:48,696
(Ghastly whispering)

1205
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:52,482
- Come into me, baby.

1206
00:53:54,550 --> 00:53:56,300
Justin?
- Hi, Candyce.

1207
00:53:59,798 --> 00:54:02,928
- What do I have to do to be with you?

1208
00:54:02,928 --> 00:54:04,511
- [Justin] Find me.

1209
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:10,460
- Justin?

1210
00:54:12,339 --> 00:54:16,839
- [Justin] Find me, Candyce;
I'm here waiting for you.

1211
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:18,543
Candyce.

1212
00:54:21,605 --> 00:54:24,355
Come inside, be together forever.

1213
00:54:26,663 --> 00:54:28,343
- I'm here.

1214
00:54:28,343 --> 00:54:32,434
- I'm inside, Candyce
- I'm comin' for you.

1215
00:54:32,434 --> 00:54:34,095
Justin,

1216
00:54:34,095 --> 00:54:34,928
I'm here.

1217
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:38,695
Where are you hiding?

1218
00:54:38,695 --> 00:54:40,514
- [Justin] Come to me, Candyce.

1219
00:54:40,514 --> 00:54:41,347
Find me.

1220
00:54:41,347 --> 00:54:44,100
- Come on, work work. (Screams)

1221
00:54:45,613 --> 00:54:49,363
(Justin laughing maniacally)

1222
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,883
- Gary, lights.

1223
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:57,700
Madigan, Candyce has wandered off again.

1224
00:54:57,700 --> 00:54:59,020
We're gonna need her for the final lair

1225
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:00,460
of the praying mantis.

1226
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,550
Now go find her!

1227
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:02,383
Quickly, c'mon!

1228
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:03,840
- Steve, I am about ready...

1229
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:05,682
Okay.

1230
00:55:05,682 --> 00:55:08,599
(Foreboding music)

1231
00:55:09,863 --> 00:55:12,696
- (scoffs) Shoot.

1232
00:55:15,569 --> 00:55:20,569
(Ghastly whispering)
(ominous music)

1233
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,247
(intriguing music)

1234
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:32,699
(ominous music)

1235
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:51,296
What the hell?

1236
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:52,129
What is that? (Wheezes)

1237
00:55:52,129 --> 00:55:56,629
(Trish gasping and breathing heavily)

1238
00:56:05,910 --> 00:56:07,983
- Don't spill the blood.

1239
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:11,843
Are you gonna help us?

1240
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,100
- Anything you need, Steve.

1241
00:56:15,100 --> 00:56:16,050
- Look, find Trish.

1242
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,550
She's gonna have to play
queen of the moth eaters.

1243
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:20,920
- Steve, I would very much like

1244
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,833
to play king of the moth eaters.

1245
00:56:24,470 --> 00:56:25,303
- Trish?

1246
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:28,333
Hey.

1247
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,723
Where are you?

1248
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:33,813
Goddammit.

1249
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:39,245
(Ghastly whispering)

1250
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,153
What the fuck?

1251
00:56:46,296 --> 00:56:47,629
Oh Jesus Christ.

1252
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:54,150
What the hell is this?

1253
00:56:54,150 --> 00:56:56,790
I found it hidden in the
dressing room recording.

1254
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:57,730
- Whose is it?

1255
00:56:57,730 --> 00:56:59,030
- It's Ollie's.

1256
00:56:59,030 --> 00:57:00,290
- Why was it in the dressing room?

1257
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:01,310
- Why do you think?

1258
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:02,753
- We undress in there.

1259
00:57:03,770 --> 00:57:04,740
- My cousin (mumbles),

1260
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:07,560
he owns this site buldgingboobies.com.

1261
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,110
I wanted to make some money on the side.

1262
00:57:10,110 --> 00:57:11,820
- Over my dead body!

1263
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:13,080
Steve please.

1264
00:57:13,080 --> 00:57:14,994
- Can we hook this up to the monitor?

1265
00:57:14,994 --> 00:57:15,827
- What for?

1266
00:57:15,827 --> 00:57:16,813
- Maybe there's something here we can use.

1267
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:18,283
- I think I should go now.

1268
00:57:19,290 --> 00:57:20,210
- Find Trish!

1269
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,650
- She wasn't in the dressing room.

1270
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:22,923
- Well go find her!

1271
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,070
- I can't believe you!

1272
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:27,340
- What do you want me to do?

1273
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,570
I have a film to finish!

1274
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:31,761
Where the hell is everybody?

1275
00:57:31,761 --> 00:57:32,850
Fuckin' where's Ollie?

1276
00:57:32,850 --> 00:57:34,490
Go find him, we need our leading man!

1277
00:57:34,490 --> 00:57:37,010
- I'm gonna find him and rip his guts out!

1278
00:57:37,010 --> 00:57:39,453
- Bring him back first,
maybe we'll film it!

1279
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,447
(Door slamming)

1280
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,610
- Alright Steve, it's ready.

1281
00:57:50,488 --> 00:57:53,288
- I wonder what Chad looks
like under those tight pants.

1282
00:57:54,773 --> 00:57:56,305
- (Mumbles) he's your type.

1283
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:58,480
- What do you mean?

1284
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,150
- What, you haven't seen
the way he looked at Ollie?

1285
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:02,743
- You mean he's--
- Yeah.

1286
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:05,180
- Huh.

1287
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,580
I wonder what Ollie looks like

1288
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,977
under those baggy plaid pants.

1289
00:58:08,977 --> 00:58:10,060
- Eww, gross.

1290
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:13,713
- Steve is such an asshole.

1291
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,363
- I got my uterus adjusted today.

1292
00:58:18,394 --> 00:58:20,207
- Really?
- The doctor did it.

1293
00:58:20,207 --> 00:58:21,210
It was really wild.

1294
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:23,060
He like pressed on my stomach

1295
00:58:23,060 --> 00:58:26,670
and he pushed my leg over kinda like that.

1296
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:28,530
It's just so cool.

1297
00:58:28,530 --> 00:58:29,940
- Alright Steve, c'mon
this stuff is private.

1298
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,230
- Gary, you must learn that in filmmaking

1299
00:58:33,230 --> 00:58:38,230
nothing (chuckles) I mean
nothing is private. (Laughs)

1300
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:44,557
(door creaking)
(foreboding music)

1301
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:49,179
- Trish, Candyce?

1302
00:58:51,636 --> 00:58:52,469
Ollie?

1303
00:59:12,425 --> 00:59:13,258
- Oh shit!

1304
00:59:17,454 --> 00:59:22,128
(Security guard grunting)
(intense music)

1305
00:59:22,128 --> 00:59:25,626
(Ollie whimpering)

1306
00:59:25,626 --> 00:59:28,209
(door banging)

1307
00:59:42,615 --> 00:59:45,115
(eerie music)

1308
00:59:55,076 --> 00:59:57,909
(Ollie screaming)

1309
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:01,970
- Alright, this is boring.

1310
01:00:01,970 --> 01:00:02,810
Nothing I can use.

1311
01:00:02,810 --> 01:00:04,460
C'mon people, let's go, let's go.

1312
01:00:08,041 --> 01:00:09,452
- What the hell?

1313
01:00:09,452 --> 01:00:14,119
What is that? (Gasps)

1314
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:23,170
- Tell me it's not real.
- Jesus Christ.

1315
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:29,280
- Is this is one of your
fucking games, Steve.

1316
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,113
- Honestly, no.

1317
01:00:33,107 --> 01:00:33,940
- Tell me it's not real.

1318
01:00:33,940 --> 01:00:35,230
- Look, this is what we're gonna do.

1319
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,445
We're gonna get everybody and
round 'em up and leave, okay?

1320
01:00:37,445 --> 01:00:38,278
- Why?

1321
01:00:38,278 --> 01:00:39,111
Where are you going?

1322
01:00:39,111 --> 01:00:40,776
- Steve you just saw that, right?

1323
01:00:40,776 --> 01:00:41,650
- (Weeps) Trish.

1324
01:00:41,650 --> 01:00:43,383
- What about the movie?

1325
01:00:45,314 --> 01:00:46,696
(Stool crashing)

1326
01:00:46,696 --> 01:00:48,290
- The movie?!

1327
01:00:48,290 --> 01:00:50,543
- Candyce, Chad, Darlene, Rebecca.

1328
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,190
There's someone else in here.

1329
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,587
- With black boots and dark pants.

1330
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:59,420
(Ollie screaming)

1331
01:01:00,524 --> 01:01:05,524
(pipe clanking)
(Ollie whimpering)

1332
01:01:08,745 --> 01:01:09,720
- Gary, Gary, wait up!

1333
01:01:09,720 --> 01:01:10,820
We should stick together!

1334
01:01:10,820 --> 01:01:11,985
C'mon, Madigan.

1335
01:01:11,985 --> 01:01:13,145
Gary!

1336
01:01:13,145 --> 01:01:14,195
- What about my film?

1337
01:01:17,292 --> 01:01:18,125
- Gary!

1338
01:01:19,803 --> 01:01:20,636
Gary!

1339
01:01:21,481 --> 01:01:22,467
Gary!

1340
01:01:22,467 --> 01:01:23,300
- What about Ollie?

1341
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:24,775
We have to help him!

1342
01:01:24,775 --> 01:01:27,347
- What about my film?

1343
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:29,563
- Fuck your film, come on!

1344
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:35,607
(Security guard grunting)
(foreboding music)

1345
01:01:41,662 --> 01:01:42,912
- [Kevin] Gary!

1346
01:01:49,733 --> 01:01:50,566
Gary, no!

1347
01:01:54,859 --> 01:01:55,692
- Ollie.

1348
01:01:55,692 --> 01:01:57,663
(Door rattling)

1349
01:01:57,663 --> 01:01:58,496
Dammit!

1350
01:02:00,093 --> 01:02:01,269
(Ominous music)

1351
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:02,102
- Come on!

1352
01:02:02,982 --> 01:02:05,899
(Muffled shouting)

1353
01:02:07,009 --> 01:02:08,900
He's this way.

1354
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:11,516
(Madigan screaming)

1355
01:02:11,516 --> 01:02:12,933
Oh my god, Trish.

1356
01:02:14,432 --> 01:02:17,213
- Oh shit, who's doing this?

1357
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:19,009
- Portia? (Grunts)

1358
01:02:19,009 --> 01:02:20,521
Get up.

1359
01:02:20,521 --> 01:02:22,521
C'mon, you gotta get up.

1360
01:02:23,712 --> 01:02:24,959
Gotta get up.

1361
01:02:24,959 --> 01:02:29,823
Good, gotta go.

1362
01:02:31,607 --> 01:02:34,350
(Grunts) Ooh boy, (mumbles).

1363
01:02:38,937 --> 01:02:41,097
(Foreboding music)

1364
01:02:41,097 --> 01:02:42,828
- [Kevin] Gary!

1365
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:43,661
- Fuck.

1366
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,463
Shit, come on!

(Spear swishing)
(ghastly whispering)

1368
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,640
- Here!

01:03:04,411 --> 01:03:07,328
(Ollie whimpering)

1370
01:03:11,794 --> 01:03:14,127
- There's someone down here.

1371
01:03:17,616 --> 01:03:20,283
(Ollie wincing)

1372
01:03:23,038 --> 01:03:24,673
- What are we gonna do
when we get to save him?

1373
01:03:24,673 --> 01:03:25,756
- We can try.

1374
01:03:28,467 --> 01:03:30,967
(Eerie music)

1375
01:03:32,713 --> 01:03:35,546
- (mumbles) door.

1376
01:03:38,098 --> 01:03:40,931
(Ollie screaming)

1377
01:03:49,253 --> 01:03:52,253
(muffled crosstalk)

1378
01:03:54,714 --> 01:03:56,603
- Come on, we've got to get outta here.

1379
01:03:56,603 --> 01:03:57,436
- Shut up!

1380
01:03:59,750 --> 01:04:03,638
(Foreboding music)
(door creaking)

1381
01:04:03,638 --> 01:04:05,971
- Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

1382
01:04:10,089 --> 01:04:13,006
(Muffled chanting)

1383
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:21,058

01:04:28,572 --> 01:04:31,405
(blood trickling)

1385
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:35,821
- Open it, Steve.

1386
01:04:38,130 --> 01:04:40,913
- Madigan, you go ahead.

1387
01:04:40,913 --> 01:04:42,163
I'll cover you.

1388
01:05:00,237 --> 01:05:01,994
(Door squeaking)

1389
01:05:01,994 --> 01:05:06,994
(Ollie thudding)
(Madigan screaming)

1390
01:05:12,094 --> 01:05:12,927
- Steve.

1391
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:28,296
(Intriguing music)

1392
01:05:37,006 --> 01:05:42,006
(knife swishing)
(Portia screaming)

1393
01:05:45,105 --> 01:05:47,688
- Ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh, ssh.

1394
01:05:50,788 --> 01:05:53,258
Be quiet, do you wanna get killed?

1395
01:05:53,258 --> 01:05:54,782
(Muffled screaming)

1396
01:05:54,782 --> 01:05:55,615
Be quiet.

1397
01:05:57,436 --> 01:05:58,269
Be quiet.

1398
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:03,170
- If you're gonna rape
me, don't scratch my face.

1399
01:06:03,170 --> 01:06:04,560
I'm an actress, you know.

1400
01:06:06,241 --> 01:06:08,341
It's cold in here, I need another blanket.

1401
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:12,943
- Mother.

1402
01:06:15,791 --> 01:06:16,624
Ooh, fuck.

1403
01:06:18,180 --> 01:06:19,860
- Don't try anything weird.

1404
01:06:19,860 --> 01:06:22,160
I'm not into that stuff.

1405
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:24,610
Go real slow 'cause I have
a moisture deficiency.

1406
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:27,320
Don't try to kiss me either.

1407
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,120
I don't want any of your icky germs.

1408
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,800
Oh and bring me water when you're done.

1409
01:06:38,114 --> 01:06:40,697
- (Winces) Ow.

1410
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:43,249
- Wear a condom.

1411
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:45,740
I don't wanna have an ape baby.

1412
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,160
- Come on, get dressed!

1413
01:06:49,798 --> 01:06:50,631
- What are you doing?

1414
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,190
- We gotta get outta here.

1415
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,090
- Come back here and finish
what you started, you bastard.

1416
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:57,970
- Shut up, Portia.

1417
01:06:57,970 --> 01:07:00,420
- Don't you tell me to shut up!

1418
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,660
Nobody tells me to shut up!

1419
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:03,920
I'm leaving!

1420
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,590
- Portia, come back! (Thuds)

1421
01:07:06,590 --> 01:07:09,470
- I'm not coming back until you apologize.

1422
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:14,903
- Portia!

1423
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:19,690
Portia, come here!

1424
01:07:21,336 --> 01:07:24,003
(Ominous music)

1425
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,477
Portia!

1426
01:07:39,477 --> 01:07:40,727
Portia, Portia!

1427
01:07:47,227 --> 01:07:50,977
(Light bonking and jingling)

1428
01:07:52,557 --> 01:07:55,474
(foreboding music)

1429
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,458
(yelping softly)

1430
01:08:13,594 --> 01:08:14,427
Portia.

1431
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,071
Portia!

1432
01:08:20,643 --> 01:08:21,476
Portia.

1433
01:08:24,804 --> 01:08:27,137
- It's me, it's me, it's me.

1434
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:30,706
- Where's everybody?

1435
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,456
- We have to get out.

1436
01:08:36,998 --> 01:08:39,498
(Eerie music)

1437
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:49,953
- (gasps) Shit.

1438
01:08:59,745 --> 01:09:01,507
(Screaming)
(leg cracking)

1439
01:09:01,507 --> 01:09:02,340
Ow!

1440
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:28,982
(Pitchfork grinding)

1441
01:09:34,328 --> 01:09:37,015
(gate rattling)

1442
01:09:37,015 --> 01:09:38,015
Ooh, please.

1443
01:09:45,277 --> 01:09:50,277
(Screaming)
(blood sloshing)

1444
01:09:56,635 --> 01:09:58,385
- Madi, try the door.

1445
01:10:00,228 --> 01:10:02,895
(Ominous music)

1446
01:10:09,477 --> 01:10:10,810
This way, c'mon.

1447
01:10:11,813 --> 01:10:12,646
Whoa.

1448
01:10:12,646 --> 01:10:16,071
(Madigan yelping)

1449
01:10:16,071 --> 01:10:17,328

Candyce.

1452
01:10:28,886 --> 01:10:31,903
They're all dead!

01:10:31,903 --> 01:10:34,820
(Foreboding music)

1454
01:10:49,714 --> 01:10:53,714

(Audience applauding)

1456
01:11:00,620 --> 01:11:03,150
A movie will never join

1457
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:05,730
the great ones.

1458
01:11:05,730 --> 01:11:07,363
Masterpieces!

Cut.

1467
01:11:42,210 --> 01:11:43,850
- Steve showed me this room.

1468
01:11:43,850 --> 01:11:45,490
- Can we go out through the window?

1469
01:11:45,490 --> 01:11:47,250
- [Madigan] It's pretty high.

1470
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:48,863
- Madi, isn't that his car?

1471
01:11:50,930 --> 01:11:52,616
- What time is it?

1472
01:11:52,616 --> 01:11:54,452
- It's quarter after, he
should be there by now.

1473
01:11:54,452 --> 01:11:57,178
- You're right.

1474
01:11:57,178 --> 01:11:58,011
- Listen.

1475
01:11:59,188 --> 01:12:00,438
His radio's on.

1476
01:12:01,445 --> 01:12:02,817
He's not dead after all.

1477
01:12:02,817 --> 01:12:04,734
- Let's get outta here.

1478
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:10,870

(Board cracking)
(ominous music)

1488
01:13:05,824 --> 01:13:08,507

Run.

(intense orchestral music)

1497
01:15:10,256 --> 01:15:11,089
C'mon.

1498
01:15:13,137 --> 01:15:16,054
(Tires screeching)

1499
01:15:28,365 --> 01:15:31,036
Anyone else get out?
- No.

1500
01:15:31,036 --> 01:15:33,210
(Siren wailing)

1501
01:15:33,210 --> 01:15:34,043

(Tires screeching)
(cars smashing)

1503
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:09,422
- I know who the security guard is.

1504
01:16:09,422 --> 01:16:10,255
- Who?

1505
01:16:10,255 --> 01:16:11,088
- It's Daryl James

1506
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:11,921
- Who's that?

1507
01:16:11,921 --> 01:16:12,754
- Do you remember in Candyce's scrapbook

1508
01:16:12,754 --> 01:16:13,587
the face was X'd out?

1509
01:16:13,587 --> 01:16:14,420
That's him.

1510
01:16:14,420 --> 01:16:15,253
- You mean the guy who shot--

1511
01:16:15,253 --> 01:16:18,535
- Yeah, the guy who shot--
- Justin?

1512
01:16:18,535 --> 01:16:20,993

(Madigan shouting)

1518
01:17:09,199 --> 01:17:10,032
Madi.

1519
01:17:14,075 --> 01:17:15,158
Just in case.

1520
01:17:17,250 --> 01:17:22,250
(Intense chase music)
(tires screeching)

1521
01:17:28,925 --> 01:17:30,642
- Kevin, what's the plan?

1522
01:17:30,642 --> 01:17:32,856
- Just keep your head down.

1523
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:35,439

1524
01:17:37,968 --> 01:17:39,289

1527
01:17:42,263 --> 01:17:43,096
Kevin!

(Gun blasting)

1529
01:17:49,419 --> 01:17:50,874
Kevin!

1530
01:17:50,874 --> 01:17:53,541
(Both grunting)

1531
01:17:54,991 --> 01:17:55,824
- You killed them.

1532
01:17:55,824 --> 01:17:57,407
You killed them all, you son of a bitch!

1533
01:17:57,407 --> 01:17:58,669
- I didn't.
- Then why are you chasin' us?

1534
01:17:58,669 --> 01:17:59,967
- 'Cause I thought you killed them.

1535
01:17:59,967 --> 01:18:01,880
- I thought you were deaf.

1536
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:02,910
- I may be deaf.

1537
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:04,920
I'm not dumb; I read lips.

1538
01:18:05,896 --> 01:18:07,600
- So why are you were
listening to the radio?

1539
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,883
- So people think I can hear.

1540
01:18:11,241 --> 01:18:12,074
- Get out of the way,
I'll knock his head in.

1541
01:18:12,074 --> 01:18:13,840
- Madigan no, he's not the killer.

1542
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:14,850
- What are you talking about?

1543
01:18:14,850 --> 01:18:16,475
- He followed us 'cause
he thought we were.

1544
01:18:16,475 --> 01:18:17,308
Look, look.

1545
01:18:17,308 --> 01:18:19,183
He's got brown shoes, not black boots.

1546
01:18:22,870 --> 01:18:24,510
- You're Daryl James, aren't you?

1547
01:18:24,510 --> 01:18:25,343
- Yeah.

1548
01:18:25,343 --> 01:18:26,650
- They said you disappeared after Justin--

1549
01:18:26,650 --> 01:18:29,881
- Justin tried to blow my brains out.

1550
01:18:29,881 --> 01:18:31,331
That's how I lost my hearing.

1551
01:18:32,635 --> 01:18:36,070
(Mumbles) felt sorry for
me and he give me a job.

1552
01:18:36,070 --> 01:18:38,730
- If you didn't do it
and we didn't do it--

1553
01:18:38,730 --> 01:18:41,608
- Whoever did it, must
still be back at the studio.

1554
01:18:41,608 --> 01:18:43,240
- Oh my god.

1555
01:18:43,240 --> 01:18:45,033
Oh my god, Portia.

1556
01:18:46,533 --> 01:18:48,700
- Hey, where is everybody?

1557
01:18:51,002 --> 01:18:52,585
I need some water!

1558
01:18:59,645 --> 01:19:00,895
Hey guys, look!

1559
01:19:02,922 --> 01:19:04,505
I found your ghost.

1560
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:06,680
Justin, woo!

1561
01:19:10,793 --> 01:19:11,626
Hey!

1562
01:19:15,313 --> 01:19:17,143
Where'd you guys go?

1563
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:18,893
Trish?

1564
01:19:21,010 --> 01:19:23,436
(Chain squeaking)

1565
01:19:23,436 --> 01:19:24,269
Steve.

1566
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,887
Where are you?

1567
01:19:32,512 --> 01:19:35,012
You guys playin' tricks on me?

1568
01:19:42,796 --> 01:19:45,713
(Foreboding music)

1569
01:19:56,991 --> 01:19:57,870
I don't know how I got hooked up

1570
01:19:57,870 --> 01:19:59,593
with such a bunch of losers.

1571
01:20:00,741 --> 01:20:05,102
(Anchor whooshing)
(Portia screaming)

1572
01:20:05,102 --> 01:20:07,769
(intense music)

1573
01:20:52,877 --> 01:20:56,319
- Folks shouldn't fuck with a man's house.

1574
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:58,047
It ain't right.

1575
01:20:58,047 --> 01:21:00,852
Shouldn't fuck with him.

1576
01:21:00,852 --> 01:21:02,935
Ain't that right, Justin?

1577
01:21:04,315 --> 01:21:05,497
- Ain't that the truth, huh.

1578
01:21:05,497 --> 01:21:07,997
