Come, bring all food.

27
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:31,796
So, all you find available.

28
00:01:32,046 --> 00:01:35,149
Mole, what level of food now?

29
00:01:35,999 --> 00:01:38,379
I think i thin this year.

30
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,600
Sure we could rephrase.

31
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,149
We are at a dramatically!

32
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:46,899
We will all die!

33
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:50,553
No, no, no!
Be optimistic, brothers.

34
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:52,518
Everything is under control.

35
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,193
Look ... food!

36
00:01:55,453 --> 00:01:58,552
I'm afraid that
it's not edible!

37
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,753
Brilliant!

38
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:03,054
What is it?

39
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:05,257
A cart with peanuts?

40
00:02:05,607 --> 00:02:07,517
A cart of peanuts ...

41
00:02:07,656 --> 00:02:10,255
This could be our salvation
for the winter!

42
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:13,090
- Andie!
- I left, you will not regret it.

43
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:15,656
Grayson ... will go with you.

44
00:02:15,756 --> 00:02:19,006
With all due respect, sir,
I can do this myself.

45
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:19,909
Grayson!

46
00:02:20,059 --> 00:02:22,209
Ole!

47
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:24,559
Girls like tail!

48
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,359
Help Andie,
to gather as many nuts!

49
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,910
- To the park!
- To the park!

50
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,509
What she said.

51
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:36,513
But above all,
Watch the ... I know who.

52
00:02:37,263 --> 00:02:39,463
No! Not him!

53
00:02:39,613 --> 00:02:41,913
Yes ... himself.

54
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:45,563
Yeah, come to daddy.

55
00:02:47,064 --> 00:02:50,204
Hey, buddy,
I do not know where the bank?

56
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,317
Thank you!

57
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,916
Hey ... moron!

58
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,789
I head crime,
released early </ i>

59
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,323
Hey, sir ...

60
00:03:23,473 --> 00:03:25,638
I want some peanuts!

61
00:03:25,673 --> 00:03:27,873
Off, we closed!

62
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:30,322
The sign says ... it's open!

63
00:03:30,323 --> 00:03:31,473
Get out!

64
00:03:34,024 --> 00:03:36,227
Heard?
I want peanuts!

65
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:37,497
You nuts?

66
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:46,875
You get our hands on those nuts
before we know the whole park.

67
00:03:46,876 --> 00:03:50,876
Let's plan!
That's us, that's the cart.

68
00:03:50,877 --> 00:03:55,057
We rob the wagon and eat
all winter until squished!

69
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:58,845
What are you watching?

70
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,130
Great!
Company.

71
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,979
Well, we must act.

72
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,683
Get in the bucket!

73
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:14,898
Officer,
man that attacked me nuts!

74
00:04:14,933 --> 00:04:17,733
Do not listen to him Officer ...

75
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,034
I want to see,
Authorization for sale!

76
00:04:23,637 --> 00:04:24,987
There he is!

77
00:04:25,387 --> 00:04:29,186
It's food that you feed the
Park all winter.

78
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,870
But the dog,
We will do the job more complicated!

79
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,936
Grayson ...

80
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:34,186
Grayson!?

81
00:04:34,936 --> 00:04:37,139
- Quiet!
- What are you doing?

82
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:39,738
Tracks after the scoundrel sniff that.

83
00:04:39,739 --> 00:04:42,539
Though sniff
strange odors!

84
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,490
Gene? Smell of man?

85
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,840
Dog hair!

86
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:54,193
I knew it!
You stay here!

87
00:04:54,443 --> 00:04:58,092
Honestly, woman! I'm still
hero of this park!

88
00:04:58,093 --> 00:05:03,603
Which makes me wonder,
Why do not you ask me on a date?

89
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:10,797
I smell a rat!

90
00:05:14,896 --> 00:05:16,806
What are you doing here, Grayson?

91
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,500
Great!

92
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,034
So, would you and I
cart with peanuts?

93
00:05:30,035 --> 00:05:31,899
Of course, the park needs them.

94
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,299
Well, you're late, sis!
Better go!

95
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,150
Me and Buddy, got here first
and they will not share.

96
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,902
Yes, we are in the middle of autumn
and reserves are extremely low that!

97
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:44,268
Cart that,
We can feed everyone!

98
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,837
Let's work together,
We can make a deal!

99
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:50,169
Would you give me that?

100
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:54,254
I do not understand, you can help
entire park, but you did it.

101
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:58,491
This is your chance to prove,
Raccoon I was wrong about you.

102
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,956
I do not care what you think, Raccoon!

103
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:05,165
Then do it for the park.
Do not think only of you.

104
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:09,343
There are independent.
That means I'm number one.

105
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:12,308
I suggest you do the same,
if you want to survive.

106
00:06:12,309 --> 00:06:13,329
Do you understand?

107
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,410
I'm sorry for you, Surly.

108
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,313
Aha! I found, Andie,
in a tree.

109
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:27,138
Very clever, Surly.

110
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:31,712
You should be arrested z?d?rnicirea
assault the wagon with peanuts!

111
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:35,713
- It's okay, Grayson, I understand.
- He understood better help her.

112
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:38,564
Hey, Supergirl ... calm down!

113
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,617
We pull out the tail.

114
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:42,966
How about you hang out?

115
00:06:42,967 --> 00:06:46,816
Listen, I'd like to stay and chat,
but I have a date with destiny.

116
00:06:46,817 --> 00:06:49,116
Fate? I know her?

117
00:06:49,366 --> 00:06:51,516
Good luck, suckers!

118
00:06:51,766 --> 00:06:54,317
It was fantastic!

119
00:06:54,669 --> 00:06:56,819
That was painful.

120
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:59,270
This will end badly.

121
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,949
Excuse me, officer.
I saw everything.

122
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,623
Little girl, a little exaggeration.

123
00:07:11,658 --> 00:07:12,948
Not true!

124
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:22,874
I Understand, officer, she attacked me.
I am innocent ... </ i>

125
00:07:33,527 --> 00:07:35,477
That's not good.

126
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,630
Enjoy your meal!

127
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,284
Hey!
Cart, go!

128
00:07:57,834 --> 00:08:00,683
- My cart!
- Let's go!

129
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:07,133
Peanuts!

130
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:09,734
What a woman!

131
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,640
It will cost you ten percent!

132
00:08:44,644 --> 00:08:47,293
I saved the day?

133
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:57,746
Grayson, trying to take
how many nuts you!

134
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,496
Hey! What's that smell?

135
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,722
It's my perfume.

136
00:09:00,723 --> 00:09:04,547
Made from tree sap
hawk and tears.

137
00:09:04,647 --> 00:09:07,346
- Get back!
- Watch the tail, is inflamabil?!

138
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,017
These nuts are ours!

139
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:12,798
These nuts are mine!

140
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:16,599
Surly, to negotiate,
must we share the park.

141
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,300
Yes, fair enough.
One hundred thousand and zero to you!

142
00:09:27,754 --> 00:09:31,044
Absolutely not have
clearance for this.

143
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:35,503
You have to stop the wagon!

144
00:09:35,803 --> 00:09:36,853
Help me!

145
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,094
Surly, help me, my friend!

146
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,767
Damn you, Surly!

147
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:00,759
Surly, you coward!

148
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,710
Thank you.

149
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,710
Grayson, oak!

150
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,864
We have the result.
Stocat? food in our oak tree ...

151
00:10:16,114 --> 00:10:19,212
There will be enough,
to get out of the winter.

152
00:10:19,213 --> 00:10:21,213
We will die!

153
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:22,513
Raccoon!

154
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,264
Raccoon holding a speech!

155
00:10:25,364 --> 00:10:27,463
- Although the situation seems sumbr? ...
- Excuse me!

156
00:10:27,464 --> 00:10:30,166
- Andie and Grayson are ...
- You listen to me!

157
00:10:30,167 --> 00:10:35,267
This park will go away!
You have courage and hope!

158
00:10:37,017 --> 00:10:38,017
Raccoon!

159
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,214
- Andie and Grayson are ...
- Quiet ... shut up!

160
00:10:41,215 --> 00:10:43,215
Grayson,
do not let us down yet.

161
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:46,968
I think it's on the way,
even at this point, bringing ...

162
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:49,770
A cart with nuts on fire!

163
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:51,770
What?

164
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,519
Our food will be destroyed!

165
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,480
Why did not you say anything!

166
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,874
Tree, our tree.

167
00:11:13,474 --> 00:11:16,484
My face will be disfigured perfect!

168
00:11:26,427 --> 00:11:27,826
Grayson!

169
00:11:27,926 --> 00:11:29,179
Grayson!

170
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:30,879
Where are you?

171
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,699
What happened here!

172
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,529
Who's responsible for this?

173
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:42,830
Let go of me, clowns,
making a big mistake!

174
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,234
I have an alibi, I have witnesses!

175
00:11:45,884 --> 00:11:50,333
I found it hidden like a snake,
in one of our galleries!

176
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:54,584
Recover buried nuts,
That's what I was doing!

177
00:11:55,133 --> 00:11:58,118
Smells like burnt peanuts?
Or is it me?

178
00:11:58,119 --> 00:12:00,085
What's going on?

179
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,437
Look at this!

180
00:12:03,587 --> 00:12:05,786
You gave this up in winter!

181
00:12:05,787 --> 00:12:11,377
Look at this the camp fire!
I've never seen anything like this, right?

182
00:12:12,387 --> 00:12:15,988
Do not be afraid,
This great body is unharmed!

183
00:12:15,989 --> 00:12:19,223
Raccoon, let me organize
process, just give me the order!

184
00:12:19,224 --> 00:12:22,239
Another process?
Do not shoot ?nv???minte.

185
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,489
It takes a bit more!

186
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,690
He's a real danger.

187
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,455
No!

188
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,693
No, we respect the law,
justice will take care of him.

189
00:12:31,694 --> 00:12:36,444
They will be right, right?
Right, it's what they get.

190
00:12:36,794 --> 00:12:40,892
Raise your hands,
all those who are for banning.

191
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:42,793
- Banished!
- Chasing?

192
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,694
Feet?
Yes, please.

193
00:12:45,594 --> 00:12:48,793
Why hesitate,
refused to join us.

194
00:12:48,794 --> 00:12:51,534
He ridiculed our hard work!

195
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,912
He stole, cheated us,
lied to us and now

196
00:12:54,913 --> 00:12:59,083
destroyed our only source
of food for the winter!

197
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,398
To decide!

198
00:13:02,849 --> 00:13:07,399
And ... give up paws.
Why is rising ground in front of me!

199
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,650
We do not condemn without trial,
do not like.

200
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,460
We ran out of options
to squirrel it, Andie.

201
00:13:16,501 --> 00:13:20,104
Do what you want,
Do what is right!

202
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:31,554
Wait, Buddy did not vote.

203
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:34,191
Must be unanimous,
that's right!

204
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:36,956
I will not disappoint?
Right, Buddy?

205
00:13:36,957 --> 00:13:37,957
Buddy?

206
00:13:40,007 --> 00:13:42,907
You were saying?

207
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:49,059
I assume authority granted Raccoon By </ i>

208
00:13:49,109 --> 00:13:51,209
I and a community park ... </ i>

209
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,060
I is not up ... </ i>

210
00:13:53,095 --> 00:13:57,110
I squirrel Surly,
will be banished to town </ i>

211
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,294
I is not never coming back
in our beloved Liberty Park. </ i>

212
00:14:01,295 --> 00:14:03,675
Now, please, can I get off?

213
00:14:11,364 --> 00:14:14,504
You had to have part of the process, Surly.

214
00:14:14,964 --> 00:14:16,214
Sorry.

215
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,717
That's my punishment, Buddy.

216
00:15:07,927 --> 00:15:09,967
I apple pie mother </ i>

217
00:15:10,927 --> 00:15:13,027
Not so bad!

218
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,830
Dirty rat!

219
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:47,984
I Look, a rat </ i>

220
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:53,477
No shoes!

221
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,449
Buddy, Buddy, talk to me!
Come on!

222
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,640
Talk to me, buddy, come on!

223
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,600
How good I feel that I am ...

224
00:17:03,853 --> 00:17:07,323
What are you doing?
Get your hands off me.

225
00:17:08,954 --> 00:17:10,754
Go back to the park!

226
00:17:12,004 --> 00:17:14,354
This is dangerous!

227
00:17:14,504 --> 00:17:19,204
Besides, you're in my way.
I need one.

228
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:03,314
Look for that squirrel?
And I!

229
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,215
Come on boys, come on, come on,
I love rats!

230
00:18:27,216 --> 00:18:30,612
My best friend
it's a rat!

231
00:18:30,613 --> 00:18:31,762
Forget it!

232
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:46,970
Come on, come on, come on, you fly!

233
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,323
Come on, Buddy, you got it!

234
00:19:29,149 --> 00:19:30,999
Let's call the boss!

235
00:19:33,149 --> 00:19:34,848
I can not do this!

236
00:19:34,849 --> 00:19:37,799
No food, no home ...
gangs of rats!

237
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,851
I'm dying here, Buddy.

238
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:42,785
I do not know, maybe I get back.

239
00:19:42,786 --> 00:19:44,299
I work in community service.

240
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,134
I will read marmots blind!

241
00:19:46,135 --> 00:19:47,898
I'll even listen to the Raccoon.

242
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:51,379
I'll do anything, anything I need a ..

243
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:53,401
I SHOP FOR PEANUTS </ i>

244
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:19,453
All right. We go and do not fill bellies.

245
00:20:19,704 --> 00:20:22,903
But ... do it my way!

246
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:27,413
I do not stuck, cars will be lifted. </ i>

247
00:21:07,395 --> 00:21:09,130
You can forget, Buddy, will not work!

248
00:21:09,131 --> 00:21:10,891
I'll handle this!

249
00:21:34,992 --> 00:21:38,855
Hey, look who's here!
Our boss!

250
00:21:38,890 --> 00:21:41,988
Fresh out of jail!
How did you get out?

251
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:43,740
How long were you in prison?
8 years, 7 years!

252
00:21:43,741 --> 00:21:45,891
It does not matter! Give me coat!

253
00:21:45,892 --> 00:21:48,392
I No, no, no. I'll take it. </ I>

254
00:22:00,134 --> 00:22:04,281
Hey, Precious, come here!
Say hello to your boss!

255
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:24,271
Yes! Hey ...

256
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,852
I want you to meet
with our new partner.

257
00:22:27,853 --> 00:22:28,833
Knuckles!

258
00:22:28,868 --> 00:22:31,119
It will be guns and safes expert!

259
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,566
Knuckles,
Say hello to Fingers and Lucky.

260
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:36,249
Hi, I'm Lucky
welcome aboard!

261
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,013
Nice, dude.

262
00:22:39,613 --> 00:22:44,212
- All right.
- What genius to find this place!

263
00:22:44,813 --> 00:22:45,528
Me!

264
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:48,060
- Yes ... I was sure.
- I found him.

265
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:52,771
And look what we have here, boss.
We even a cart!

266
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,308
I think ...

267
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,806
It is enough.

268
00:22:55,956 --> 00:23:00,455
I bought it very cheap.
And the place is perfect cover.

269
00:23:00,456 --> 00:23:04,456
And the view too!
Let's get to ...

270
00:23:04,458 --> 00:23:05,803
Plans.

271
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:07,690
Like I said.
A lot of money.

272
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:10,141
That's the bank.
The safe is here.

273
00:23:10,146 --> 00:23:12,299
Steel reinforced, solid as a rock.

274
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,890
That's why I brought these little girls.

275
00:23:15,353 --> 00:23:18,963
I go with a "bum"
and go with a prey. </ i>

276
00:23:19,102 --> 00:23:20,882
Turn out the light, come on!

277
00:23:20,903 --> 00:23:22,823
Probably rats!

278
00:23:22,955 --> 00:23:25,257
You said rats?

279
00:23:26,156 --> 00:23:28,059
What's his problem?

280
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:34,908
- Something happened, Fingers?
- I got this.

281
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:47,118
Hear my dog whistle?

282
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:51,367
You can hear this ...
If talking on tone so tall?

283
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,865
- Are you serious?
- I have not asked you!

284
00:23:54,866 --> 00:23:56,226
I asked ...

285
00:23:57,915 --> 00:23:59,415
Stop it!

286
00:23:59,515 --> 00:24:02,120
I have enough on my plate and no will.

287
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:07,068
Boss. Let me show you the basement.

288
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,305
Just if we eat
for the next three days.

289
00:24:16,306 --> 00:24:18,303
Not to mention for the winter.

290
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:21,016
That's all I can give.

291
00:24:21,067 --> 00:24:22,367
Come on, Grayson!

292
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:25,065
Five more!
Yes, another five, baby!

293
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:26,714
It's time for the fun!

294
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:27,665
All right. That!

295
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:30,517
Well ...

296
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:32,926
Let's try last scheme.

297
00:24:33,468 --> 00:24:35,268
Yes, Grayson!

298
00:24:37,469 --> 00:24:39,903
Really think Grayson,
should come with me.

299
00:24:39,904 --> 00:24:42,519
I do not think recovered
after that shot to the head.

300
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,068
Raccoon thinks it would boost morale
in these difficult times.

301
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,419
After all,
Grayson is the hero of the park.

302
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:52,542
What a champion!

303
00:24:52,674 --> 00:24:53,920
Good luck, honey.

304
00:24:53,921 --> 00:24:56,021
Find food for us.

305
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:57,220
To the park!

306
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:59,660
Our hope is in you.

307
00:25:03,425 --> 00:25:05,022
We know you'll find food!

308
00:25:05,023 --> 00:25:06,324
Take me with you!

309
00:25:06,325 --> 00:25:08,473
We have a great time.

310
00:25:08,624 --> 00:25:11,673
Hundred Eighty sun
zero chance of winter!

311
00:25:11,674 --> 00:25:13,164
Take me with you!

312
00:25:13,275 --> 00:25:14,473
Watch!

313
00:25:14,523 --> 00:25:17,860
The city is full of germs
and bright lights!

314
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:19,275
The sun is coming out.

315
00:25:19,677 --> 00:25:21,311
I have to take refuge
the safety of darkness.

316
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,627
Out of my way!

317
00:25:22,628 --> 00:25:24,479
Goodbye!

318
00:25:24,579 --> 00:25:28,476
Look at us!
We're in a heroic mission!

319
00:25:28,477 --> 00:25:31,678
I think it's the best way
to celebrate our anniversary.

320
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,445
We are not together!

321
00:25:33,479 --> 00:25:35,428
That's an important mission
as to find food!

322
00:25:35,429 --> 00:25:36,629
- Right?
- You're right.

323
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,780
Let the shit!

324
00:25:38,815 --> 00:25:41,145
Our mission is love.

325
00:25:44,532 --> 00:25:46,082
What scenet? romantic!

326
00:25:46,083 --> 00:25:47,486
I'll take it.

327
00:25:47,585 --> 00:25:53,148
Hello, rodents urban?.
That's scabies or bubonic plague?

328
00:25:53,183 --> 00:25:57,480
Anyway, my lady and me
We thought we could ...

329
00:25:57,481 --> 00:26:01,321
- Hey, leave your backpack!
- Go back backpack!

330
00:26:01,384 --> 00:26:03,436
The backpack ... Give it back!

331
00:26:06,637 --> 00:26:07,737
Hey!

332
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:12,637
Grayson!

333
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,479
Leave me!

334
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,240
Retrieve backpack!

335
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:49,009
Buddy, I ate too much cheese.

336
00:26:50,793 --> 00:26:54,063
I think I will
a baby cheese.

337
00:26:56,045 --> 00:26:57,445
I'm down.

338
00:26:58,945 --> 00:27:01,345
God!

339
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:07,646
Lana!

340
00:27:11,248 --> 00:27:13,928
God, Lana ...
You look great.

341
00:27:14,599 --> 00:27:15,946
Lana, what a surprise.

342
00:27:15,947 --> 00:27:18,598
You could and you'd call first?

343
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:19,748
There was no need.

344
00:27:19,749 --> 00:27:22,599
I told your mom
where to find you, King!

345
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,601
Look! E, Lana!

346
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,700
Who are you, monstrule??

347
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:35,554
It's a fierce bitch, watch.
He does not do very good job.

348
00:27:35,589 --> 00:27:37,002
There is only one.

349
00:27:37,404 --> 00:27:38,852
What does that mean?

350
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:40,202
Nothing!

351
00:27:40,353 --> 00:27:42,249
- What do you mean nothing?
- I said ... nothing.

352
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,403
I can not believe it!
But, you've really changed.

353
00:27:45,404 --> 00:27:48,756
Let's talk about second chances
weird.

354
00:27:48,757 --> 00:27:50,605
Yes, but do not tell anyone.

355
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:52,628
It was given still in folosin??

356
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,853
and we want to make a surprise
the grand opening!

357
00:27:55,854 --> 00:27:59,404
- Right, guys?
- Not again, you dog!

358
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:08,278
Hey, my whistle!

359
00:28:10,009 --> 00:28:11,508
You're screwed.

360
00:28:17,907 --> 00:28:19,957
A rat! A rat!

361
00:28:21,209 --> 00:28:23,362
It's in my pants!

362
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:39,164
We'll be back there on the first occasion
to get our hands on those nuts.

363
00:28:39,165 --> 00:28:41,048
But I can not go back to the park.

364
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:42,312
Better forget that.

365
00:28:42,313 --> 00:28:43,746
Thing to look glamorous!

366
00:28:43,747 --> 00:28:45,163
Come on!

367
00:28:47,114 --> 00:28:49,163
No, there's nothing here.

368
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:55,816
Dog stuff
mine!

369
00:28:58,517 --> 00:29:01,449
- Surly! What are you doing here?
- What are you doing here?

370
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,515
- Looking to eat!
- Looking to eat!

371
00:29:02,516 --> 00:29:03,513
- No!
- No!

372
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:04,915
- I'm looking for food!
- I'm looking for food!

373
00:29:04,916 --> 00:29:06,153
Hey, you find food?

374
00:29:06,154 --> 00:29:08,570
No! Nothing.
You give me that, please?

375
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:10,570
Why?
What's this?

376
00:29:10,571 --> 00:29:13,068
It's my musical instrument ...

377
00:29:13,103 --> 00:29:14,593
To sing the blues.

378
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:19,369
I did have friends, I eat, </ i>

379
00:29:19,569 --> 00:29:21,908
I thing has nothing
to do with food. </ i>

380
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:26,521
I This is a blues for the hungry. </ i>

381
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
For God!

382
00:29:28,121 --> 00:29:30,320
You got to eat, right?

383
00:29:30,355 --> 00:29:32,154
And this,
has something to do with it.

384
00:29:32,155 --> 00:29:33,624
It's silly.

385
00:29:33,973 --> 00:29:36,476
Tell me the truth!

386
00:29:38,011 --> 00:29:40,672
I think you've gone crazy.
Pardon my expression!

387
00:29:40,673 --> 00:29:42,873
Surly, I had a bad day.

388
00:29:42,874 --> 00:29:44,924
All food park went.

389
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,672
Grayson crazy
and I've just lost.

390
00:29:47,673 --> 00:29:50,723
I'm hungry and alone
and very cranky.

391
00:29:50,724 --> 00:29:54,610
Start talking or winter
will launch a new coat of squirrel.

392
00:29:54,611 --> 00:29:55,827
Do you understand?

393
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:56,979
The door!

394
00:29:57,077 --> 00:29:59,128
What? What door?

395
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:02,610
Nothing, it's just my door,
you're always open.

396
00:30:02,611 --> 00:30:04,676
- Must go.
- Come back!

397
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:07,337
Do not lose that thing, right?

398
00:30:45,835 --> 00:30:48,301
Yes!

399
00:30:48,837 --> 00:30:51,036
Buddy, I found it!

400
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:55,839
The city lost Aluntlantis!

401
00:31:26,544 --> 00:31:27,728
Thanks, buddy.

402
00:31:27,729 --> 00:31:32,844
Sorry for that outburst.
I did not say anything stupid today.

403
00:31:34,395 --> 00:31:37,455
Hey, how much is twenty percent.

404
00:31:40,332 --> 00:31:41,713
I Really </ i>

405
00:31:41,748 --> 00:31:43,095
I Twenty to hundred ... </ i>

406
00:31:43,096 --> 00:31:45,595
Gathering nuts for the winter ...

407
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:47,247
Very well, listen.

408
00:31:47,248 --> 00:31:48,795
Dig a tunnel
from here to the alley.

409
00:31:48,796 --> 00:31:51,496
And we all take reserves
to get better in winter. Do you understand?

410
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:54,699
I Twenty out of a hundred,
is twenty percent. You went to school? </ I>

411
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,015
What about it?

412
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:59,560
Maybe crying
The conditions of this work.

413
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:02,101
Okay, smarty.
Let's go.

414
00:32:19,252 --> 00:32:23,682
Well, Surly, you'd tell me
What's going on here.

415
00:32:23,805 --> 00:32:25,954
Yes, yes, give me that!

416
00:32:25,955 --> 00:32:27,988
Park's food there, right?

417
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:29,990
And you have to share it, right?

418
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:31,203
- Never!
- OK!

419
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:32,289
Okay, share.

420
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,604
- Whatever.
- Fifty-fifty!

421
00:32:33,605 --> 00:32:36,790
Fifty-fifty? I've never shared
fifty-fifty in my life.

422
00:32:36,791 --> 00:32:37,807
Fifty-fifty ...

423
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:38,758
Fifty-fifty!

424
00:32:38,791 --> 00:32:39,881
We have a deal!

425
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:44,591
I have four words for you.

426
00:32:44,592 --> 00:32:45,524
Okay!

427
00:32:45,559 --> 00:32:48,557
Thing for dogs.
How about that?

428
00:32:48,558 --> 00:32:49,856
Okay, you win, you win!

429
00:32:49,857 --> 00:32:53,857
- Get that thing out of my face!
- So can you talk?

430
00:32:53,858 --> 00:32:56,345
Okay, no more talk,
but do not blow the whistle!

431
00:32:56,346 --> 00:32:59,445
- I'm not gonna feel sorry for you.
- Sure, yeah, I understand.

432
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:01,585
Wait! Well ...
You can step down.

433
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:04,693
I'll tell you what happens,
because I seem like a reasonable guy.

434
00:33:04,694 --> 00:33:08,861
If you do not elongate
I will send back to the paddock.

435
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,862
Okay?

436
00:33:09,962 --> 00:33:13,014
And I can not go back there!

437
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:14,613
Yeah, sure, I believe.

438
00:33:14,614 --> 00:33:16,045
I'm just a victim
the circumstances.

439
00:33:16,046 --> 00:33:18,110
That's not my problem dog.

440
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:21,309
You're all right?
Do not worry about it.

441
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:23,661
It's incredible!

442
00:33:24,112 --> 00:33:27,260
It's so much food here, you can
feed park for years!

443
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:30,761
Hey, wait, wait, what?

444
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,613
- We could be friends.
- Great.

445
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:33,614
Come on ...

446
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,261
I can do all sorts of things.

447
00:33:36,296 --> 00:33:37,409
You know ...

448
00:33:37,459 --> 00:33:39,162
I can stay like this ...

449
00:33:39,212 --> 00:33:41,722
Look at this, it's crazy.

450
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:44,360
It has its own life.

451
00:33:44,711 --> 00:33:46,558
Can I make the dead look.

452
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,010
Now I resurrected, it's incredible!

453
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,311
I dynamite </ i>

454
00:33:50,312 --> 00:33:52,212
Dead and then alive. No?

455
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,443
Duc something to eat in the park!

456
00:33:54,444 --> 00:33:56,116
- What?
- We have a deal!

457
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,965
- I can attack if you want.
- I told you to shut up.

458
00:33:58,966 --> 00:34:01,349
The deal's .. I'll take part,
's my take ...

459
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,710
And we split.

460
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:05,714
I can not take all this
safe in the park.

461
00:34:05,715 --> 00:34:08,116
We need an effective plan!

462
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:09,365
Good luck with that!

463
00:34:09,366 --> 00:34:11,369
Me and Buddy,
we dig a tunnel!

464
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:13,019
It's crazy.

465
00:34:13,054 --> 00:34:15,669
No, it's brilliant!

466
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:20,118
Raccoon and other animals
will go crazy when they hear this.

467
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:21,701
I'll be back.
First thing tomorrow we start the tunnel.

468
00:34:21,702 --> 00:34:23,252
But that was our deal!

469
00:34:23,253 --> 00:34:25,964
- So now appeals.
- What? No, wait.

470
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:28,266
I said I'd work
for the park.

471
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:31,026
Well, I invite
get back to me if you want.

472
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:33,866
Who knows?
could you become a hero.

473
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:35,101
I will return with a team.

474
00:34:35,102 --> 00:34:36,672
Well done, Surly.

475
00:34:36,814 --> 00:34:38,313
No escape from the eye.

476
00:34:38,314 --> 00:34:40,012
You know what I mean!

477
00:34:40,013 --> 00:34:44,069
Hey, boss,
can I lick your face?

478
00:34:45,267 --> 00:34:46,967
Come on, do not be weird.

479
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:52,506
I propose to make a team
and bring peanuts in the park </ i>

480
00:34:53,258 --> 00:34:55,412
Listen to what I say. </ i>

481
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,664
I sun comes up </ i>

482
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:58,962
Again the street I us ... </ i>

483
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:00,612
Wait.
We have to work with Surly.

484
00:35:00,613 --> 00:35:01,947
That's right, we're working with ...

485
00:35:01,948 --> 00:35:03,375
Are you crazy!

486
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,760
We have negotiated a deal with him.
We split everything fifty-fifty.

487
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:10,091
- Have you negotiated?
- The Surly?

488
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:14,208
Are you kidding? He's the reason
for which we do not have peanuts.

489
00:35:14,209 --> 00:35:16,611
No, no, listen up!

490
00:35:18,911 --> 00:35:21,740
We always worked together
and we kept the promises!

491
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:24,553
We are not wild animals.

492
00:35:27,848 --> 00:35:30,315
These two are animals!

493
00:35:30,316 --> 00:35:31,816
Winter is coming.

494
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:35,696
If you do not work with Surly
we will not survive.

495
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:38,839
He saw and Grayson,
Book this nutty?

496
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,936
No, we separated.

497
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:43,933
Is there any way that Grayson to ...

498
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:47,694
I do not know if Grayson
will be back again.

499
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,720
Wait, then who will be ...

500
00:35:53,721 --> 00:35:55,284
I made a decision.

501
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:59,863
Beavers, Mole and Andie
will dig a tunnel to get peanuts.

502
00:35:59,864 --> 00:36:02,062
Mole will be in charge.

503
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:04,322
Who ... Me?

504
00:36:04,357 --> 00:36:07,136
Though I do not trust Surly,
we will work with him.

505
00:36:07,137 --> 00:36:10,133
Yet.
When peanuts are safe,

506
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:11,747
we take what's ours.

507
00:36:11,748 --> 00:36:14,390
Do not do business with Surly.

508
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,137
To the park!

509
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:33,963
Why not do it at night?

510
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:37,911
Well ...
Let's do it!

511
00:36:37,912 --> 00:36:38,912
Back!

512
00:36:40,055 --> 00:36:44,505
Guys ... Store nuts
was never there.

513
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,050
Allow me.

514
00:36:55,396 --> 00:36:57,595
What do you think the green!

515
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:58,828
Read my thoughts.

516
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:00,879
Wait!
I do not know that.

517
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:05,291
Andie, I'm in charge.
Go ahead, dear.

518
00:37:09,939 --> 00:37:10,939
Wake up!

519
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:11,990
Move!

520
00:37:11,991 --> 00:37:16,640
I was ready for
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

521
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:18,386
It's good!

522
00:37:26,335 --> 00:37:27,535
Grayson?

523
00:37:33,832 --> 00:37:37,081
A few days
I'm watching this place.

524
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:40,813
I have in mind every window
or vent hole.

525
00:37:40,814 --> 00:37:44,384
You want to come in,
to survive the winter ...

526
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:47,632
Talk ... with me!

527
00:37:48,029 --> 00:37:51,364
We cut the alarm wire tunnel.
When you two get to safe,

528
00:37:51,365 --> 00:37:55,126
You have three minutes to it dinamita?i
and take your money.

529
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:57,625
Dig here in the alley in the basement.

530
00:37:57,626 --> 00:37:59,407
Why not use the door?

531
00:37:59,408 --> 00:38:01,467
It can not,
a close inside.

532
00:38:01,468 --> 00:38:03,001
Listen carefully.

533
00:38:03,002 --> 00:38:06,522
We fill the vault with bags of peanuts.
I shut down and cross the border.

534
00:38:06,523 --> 00:38:10,504
It will take a few days
until they find out they have peanuts in storage.

535
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:11,518
Agree?

536
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,865
Agree.
But I do not dig.

537
00:38:13,866 --> 00:38:15,916
Because you're blind as a bat.

538
00:38:15,917 --> 00:38:18,356
What? Who said that, where are you?

539
00:38:18,357 --> 00:38:20,620
What bust talk, boss?

540
00:38:20,621 --> 00:38:24,317
Talk of almonds, peanuts,
pistachios, chestnuts ...

541
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:28,427
Enough to buy you
a race track.

542
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,416
I mention peanut candy?

543
00:38:30,417 --> 00:38:33,116
Candy ... or peanuts?

544
00:38:34,218 --> 00:38:35,664
Both.

545
00:38:37,714 --> 00:38:39,712
Listen, this is my last shot.

546
00:38:39,713 --> 00:38:42,511
I'm not going to jail that
full of rats.

547
00:38:42,512 --> 00:38:43,563
Did you hear?

548
00:38:44,513 --> 00:38:46,553
That's all we know to do.

549
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:49,860
I Fire </ i>

550
00:38:52,108 --> 00:38:53,456
I'll kill you!

551
00:38:53,606 --> 00:38:56,259
What happens there?

552
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:00,103
I's always the same </ i>

553
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:03,206
I always find the stuff that gray. </ i>

554
00:39:03,554 --> 00:39:04,654
Speak of bricks?

555
00:39:04,655 --> 00:39:07,940
We can speculate
if you are or bricks.

556
00:39:07,941 --> 00:39:12,899
But we can say that this material
has similar properties bricks.

557
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,614
Well, this is it!

558
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:17,647
I think we have a choice.

559
00:39:17,683 --> 00:39:20,849
I - Wait a minute.
- Here is a missing brick </ i>

560
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:24,050
I do not look like a brick, look good </ i>

561
00:39:25,197 --> 00:39:29,094
I Jimmy!
Jimmy </ i>

562
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:31,279
I Here is a brick off </ i>

563
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,248
I help me with this, come on </ i>

564
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:34,249
I together. </ i>

565
00:39:38,594 --> 00:39:39,943
Hey!

566
00:39:41,393 --> 00:39:43,175
It was open all the time?

567
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:44,474
I do not know, I just got.

568
00:39:44,475 --> 00:39:48,235
- Come on, I lick your face?
- Lick yourself.

569
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:51,988
What are those guys?

570
00:39:52,038 --> 00:39:54,639
Digging for bones.
Move!

571
00:40:04,384 --> 00:40:06,952
I That move. </ i>

572
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,577
Okay. I think moving.
Come on. </ I>

573
00:40:09,584 --> 00:40:14,485
Right. You're doing great.
Let him fight next.

574
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:16,486
J1, I think you are.

575
00:40:36,174 --> 00:40:37,925
Where is Surly?

576
00:40:43,175 --> 00:40:46,795
Hey guys, I found this!
Not that great?

577
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,976
Come on. No! Go!

578
00:40:51,763 --> 00:40:54,063
- Let go of the stick that.
- It's impossible.

579
00:40:54,064 --> 00:40:57,624
- Let go of the stick this!
- I do not know how ...

580
00:40:59,697 --> 00:41:01,057
Okay, all right.

581
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:03,938
Hey, Surly!

582
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:13,584
What did you eat for breakfast?

583
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:21,707
You brought peanuts!

584
00:41:22,141 --> 00:41:23,475
I Good job, Surly ... </ i>

585
00:41:23,476 --> 00:41:24,944
I'm dead!

586
00:41:27,739 --> 00:41:29,792
I will send
back to the paddock, I know.

587
00:41:29,793 --> 00:41:31,841
I want to know what to do.

588
00:41:31,842 --> 00:41:35,172
What to do? I do everything you say.
Please ...

589
00:41:38,801 --> 00:41:40,400
What happened here.

590
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:42,985
What happened?
I want answers!

591
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:45,400
Guys, look!

592
00:41:47,203 --> 00:41:50,391
Squirrel that tried
to blow up the store.

593
00:41:50,392 --> 00:41:54,212
And Precious stop her!
Can you believe it!

594
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:57,787
- Good girl, good girl!
- What about you?

595
00:41:57,857 --> 00:42:02,387
Fix the wall quickly!
I shut the door all the time!

596
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:03,759
Did you hear?

597
00:42:07,313 --> 00:42:08,659
Repay bitch!

598
00:42:08,696 --> 00:42:10,312
And fix the wall.

599
00:42:13,207 --> 00:42:15,855
That bitch is smart!

600
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,496
- Smarter than you.
- Smarter than you.

601
00:42:17,531 --> 00:42:18,888
He's smarter than me?

602
00:42:18,922 --> 00:42:20,214
He's smarter than me?

603
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:21,195
No one is smarter than you!

604
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:25,421
That's it!

605
00:42:25,456 --> 00:42:26,794
Okay!

606
00:42:26,845 --> 00:42:27,843
We again disagree.

607
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:43,679
Surly?

608
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:46,891
What's going on!

609
00:42:46,926 --> 00:42:49,090
This trash basket
has a hole.

610
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:52,234
We'll use cover
to dig a new tunnel.

611
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:53,829
Till tunnel people.

612
00:42:53,879 --> 00:42:55,081
No bricks.

613
00:42:55,482 --> 00:42:58,230
That mole was thinking there!

614
00:42:58,265 --> 00:42:59,144
How long will that take?

615
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:02,980
A day or two. Depends if you do not give
over pipes or stones.

616
00:43:03,481 --> 00:43:05,545
- There will be three days!
- There will be two days!

617
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:07,583
- Three!
- It's ridiculous!

618
00:43:07,634 --> 00:43:11,095
It will not work.
We need his approval Raccoon.

619
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:14,681
Are you kidding? I think it's Raccoon
going to like the idea.

620
00:43:14,931 --> 00:43:19,436
Yes, Raccoon.
No not here and ruin my life.

621
00:43:23,784 --> 00:43:25,485
I'll tell you one thing.

622
00:43:25,535 --> 00:43:27,784
E contempt on his face.

623
00:43:28,684 --> 00:43:30,932
Raccoon will approve it,
not serious?

624
00:43:30,966 --> 00:43:34,501
Raccoon, guy
is a thief older than me.

625
00:43:34,536 --> 00:43:37,433
But they can not see,
are blind as a marmot.

626
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:39,137
I'm the brains of this team.

627
00:43:39,172 --> 00:43:41,601
I'm the guy with ... Brain.

628
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:43,139
I already said that?

629
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:45,589
Raccoon Mountain is just a skin.

630
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,890
What?

631
00:44:26,145 --> 00:44:28,254
Hey, Surly.
You.

632
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,438
What are you doing here?
Did not have to work on that tunnel?

633
00:44:33,489 --> 00:44:35,683
Are orders of Raccoon.

634
00:44:35,718 --> 00:44:37,882
It's something you should know.

635
00:44:38,131 --> 00:44:40,782
- I was totally honest.
- Yeah, right.

636
00:44:41,335 --> 00:44:43,631
Raccoon intends
you cheat.

637
00:44:44,277 --> 00:44:45,679
We were all in agreement.

638
00:44:45,713 --> 00:44:47,075
Sorry, but ...

639
00:44:48,025 --> 00:44:50,819
Raccoon always carried my grudge.

640
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,370
And besides ...
Who says you help?

641
00:44:54,421 --> 00:44:57,221
But you help us, right?

642
00:45:00,267 --> 00:45:03,426
I'll help ... myself.

643
00:45:03,461 --> 00:45:06,110
That's right I was wrong.

644
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:11,204
Remember, Surly,
These nuts park needs.

645
00:45:12,005 --> 00:45:13,408
Do what you have.

646
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:31,640
I never authorized any ?mp?r?eal?.
Not you?

647
00:45:32,088 --> 00:45:34,835
Do you know Andie,
it was her idea.

648
00:45:35,384 --> 00:45:37,783
Looking for this?

649
00:45:39,782 --> 00:45:40,832
I know Andie.

650
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,980
Not subject
not follow orders.

651
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:45,678
But I follow the Surly.

652
00:45:46,179 --> 00:45:49,223
You know ... A tamed
even guard dog.

653
00:45:49,257 --> 00:45:52,318
Could even
and to solve our problem.

654
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:55,834
All day she Surly
will save the park ...

655
00:45:55,869 --> 00:45:59,813
There will be great celebration.

656
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:03,713
But an accident can happen.

657
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:11,356
Have you considered sabotage?

658
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:14,419
What? What are you talking about?
Talk about Surly.

659
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:16,363
A petty thief garbage.

660
00:46:16,364 --> 00:46:17,364
It's not theft ...

661
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:21,693
That's about food,
that reaches these animals.

662
00:46:21,793 --> 00:46:24,317
Forgot our motto ...

663
00:46:24,352 --> 00:46:28,004
Animals are controlled
the amount of food they have.

664
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:31,040
It is our duty
to keep them hungry.

665
00:46:31,139 --> 00:46:33,946
All right.
Where was I?

666
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:36,283
Yes, to sabotage.

667
00:46:37,082 --> 00:46:38,880
Yes ... sabotage.

668
00:46:39,577 --> 00:46:41,279
What's this? French?

669
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:01,165
What are you up to, Mole?

670
00:47:06,908 --> 00:47:08,304
Grayson?

671
00:47:08,339 --> 00:47:09,704
Surly?

672
00:47:11,105 --> 00:47:12,276
Surly!

673
00:47:12,310 --> 00:47:13,555
- Surly ...
- Get your hands.

674
00:47:13,604 --> 00:47:15,105
What's wrong with you?

675
00:47:15,204 --> 00:47:19,736
Everything. I was there
with people and cars.

676
00:47:19,771 --> 00:47:24,043
And cats ... And ... Rat.
A rat!

677
00:47:27,038 --> 00:47:29,991
Keep me.
No, you keep it.

678
00:47:29,992 --> 00:47:32,936
Watch! What are you doing?
I ... drowning.

679
00:47:33,935 --> 00:47:35,248
Buddy, take care of him.

680
00:47:35,283 --> 00:47:37,228
And keep it away
pointy things.

681
00:47:38,983 --> 00:47:40,431
Okay, okay how about this?

682
00:47:46,232 --> 00:47:48,378
Mole! What are you doing?

683
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,479
Wait, wait, it's water?

684
00:47:55,031 --> 00:47:56,378
Let's get out of here!

685
00:48:07,177 --> 00:48:09,476
I take a small zoo.
What you gonna them?

686
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,287
- A new partner.
- That's it!

687
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:13,979
Forget it.
Do you hear something?

688
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:15,578
No.

689
00:48:27,725 --> 00:48:32,339
Dog, dog, open ...

690
00:48:33,374 --> 00:48:36,321
This bird
kill me.

691
00:48:36,323 --> 00:48:40,228
Hello, Lana, no honey,
I can not right now.

692
00:48:40,581 --> 00:48:41,681
What?

693
00:48:41,882 --> 00:48:44,348
You want to pee?
Now ...

694
00:48:44,383 --> 00:48:45,885
No, no, honey, listen ...

695
00:49:01,801 --> 00:49:04,865
What was that?
Mom, are you?

696
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,202
- Go up the driveway and stop water.
- Turn the water off, I understand.

697
00:49:08,955 --> 00:49:10,805
Hey, you're not my boss!

698
00:49:11,161 --> 00:49:13,014
It seems you are.

699
00:49:13,663 --> 00:49:14,963
I love you ...

700
00:49:21,265 --> 00:49:23,518
Surly, you do?

701
00:49:25,973 --> 00:49:27,723
Shoot that rat.

702
00:49:28,474 --> 00:49:29,622
Kill him!

703
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:39,023
Quick, where water stops?

704
00:49:39,058 --> 00:49:41,968
It seems it was a rat, boss.

705
00:49:42,003 --> 00:49:43,570
Rats did this?

706
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,586
Find him.

707
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:49,074
I'm confused. What kind of rat
talk, boss?

708
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:50,824
There, there it is, the rat!

709
00:49:57,771 --> 00:49:58,915
Good?

710
00:49:58,967 --> 00:50:00,021
You'll both be fine.

711
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:03,372
Do not tell the others
I and dogs are friends, right?

712
00:50:03,407 --> 00:50:04,623
Does not look good.

713
00:50:06,722 --> 00:50:08,870
That guy needs glasses.

714
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:10,719
- Girl!
- You get ...

715
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:16,787
Surly, you left!
Wait, do not leave me!

716
00:50:16,822 --> 00:50:19,622
Up there, it's a rat crazy.

717
00:50:19,657 --> 00:50:23,736
- Grayson?
- You are?

718
00:50:23,769 --> 00:50:28,619
I can not believe!
What are you doing here?

719
00:50:40,219 --> 00:50:42,919
- He has the face!
- Not that his face.

720
00:50:44,767 --> 00:50:47,217
You're the mole?
The liar in the park.

721
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,684
There are baby chicken.

722
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:51,069
I saw sabotaging tunnel.
Raccoon put you?

723
00:50:51,104 --> 00:50:52,435
Speak!

724
00:50:53,067 --> 00:50:55,432
- Let me torture her.
- You sit six.

725
00:50:55,467 --> 00:50:56,469
Okay, boss.

726
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:58,915
Give me what you want.
Come on!

727
00:50:59,016 --> 00:51:02,852
I am a sealed vault.
Resist interrogation.

728
00:51:02,886 --> 00:51:05,469
I'm a hard nut to crack.
A concrete spine.

729
00:51:05,505 --> 00:51:07,210
A jar ...

730
00:51:07,245 --> 00:51:08,882
My eyes!

731
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,568
Raccoon tried
to stop the robbery.

732
00:51:10,603 --> 00:51:12,519
Do not bite it.

733
00:51:14,067 --> 00:51:15,869
Food a little less
means more control.

734
00:51:15,904 --> 00:51:18,671
If you succeed robbery, Raccoon
will lose control of the park.

735
00:51:21,469 --> 00:51:24,667
So what ...
You do not care about the park.

736
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:26,633
- No?
- I do not care.

737
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,368
But when I say this team
I get double.

738
00:51:29,466 --> 00:51:31,769
Do you think they believe
a criminal like you.

739
00:51:31,804 --> 00:51:33,467
After all I've done for them?

740
00:51:33,505 --> 00:51:35,486
Of course I will listen.

741
00:51:35,521 --> 00:51:37,867
Yeah, do not lie to yourself.

742
00:51:45,015 --> 00:51:47,369
Dude I was water everywhere. </ i>

743
00:51:47,406 --> 00:51:49,231
Jimmy I suffocate I'm suffocating ... </ i>

744
00:51:49,266 --> 00:51:52,868
And all I saw afterwards,
was Grayson!

745
00:51:52,903 --> 00:51:55,633
- He saved my butt.
- No, mine!

746
00:51:55,668 --> 00:51:57,879
- It was my ass.
- Yes?

747
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:00,719
Stop talking about ass
talk to me.

748
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:05,132
Grayson ...
Glad you're back.

749
00:52:05,968 --> 00:52:07,516
It was a disaster.

750
00:52:07,566 --> 00:52:09,964
I had to do with Surly.

751
00:52:10,714 --> 00:52:12,668
Surly?

752
00:52:13,165 --> 00:52:14,030
Yes, Surly ...

753
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:16,214
They think we saved your asses.

754
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:17,830
Surly!

755
00:52:17,865 --> 00:52:19,168
Watch. Vin.

756
00:52:19,203 --> 00:52:21,381
What happened?
You were not here.

757
00:52:21,414 --> 00:52:24,905
You really wanna know what happened?

758
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:25,964
It was ... Mole.

759
00:52:26,014 --> 00:52:28,014
I saw him trying
to drown twins.

760
00:52:28,212 --> 00:52:29,818
He confessed everything.

761
00:52:30,017 --> 00:52:31,676
Mole?

762
00:52:31,711 --> 00:52:33,615
Raccoon was his idea.

763
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,768
So I blame the Raccoon,
because you drove out of the park.

764
00:52:38,803 --> 00:52:40,231
No, not true.

765
00:52:40,265 --> 00:52:42,166
Raccoon
we had never done anything wrong.

766
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,330
But he did.

767
00:52:43,364 --> 00:52:46,964
Listen, I want my
and I'm out of here. Okay?

768
00:52:47,514 --> 00:52:48,529
- Grayson?
- Yes.

769
00:52:48,564 --> 00:52:51,032
- Were you there?
- Yes.

770
00:52:51,065 --> 00:52:51,978
Where?

771
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:54,379
- You think I was not?
- No!

772
00:52:54,414 --> 00:52:55,639
Nobody said that.

773
00:52:55,674 --> 00:52:56,864
Explain yourself.

774
00:52:57,664 --> 00:52:59,111
Buddy, did you see anything?

775
00:52:59,364 --> 00:53:01,611
Wait.
I ask him?

776
00:53:02,311 --> 00:53:05,418
He can not help.
You're wasting your time.

777
00:53:05,453 --> 00:53:08,214
It's useless.
He can not talk.

778
00:53:09,813 --> 00:53:11,413
He knows only
to obey orders.

779
00:53:12,363 --> 00:53:13,762
Just like you, Andie.

780
00:53:25,164 --> 00:53:28,213
So you treat him the only
animal defends you?

781
00:53:28,410 --> 00:53:31,828
No, no, leave him alone.
The tunnel is open.

782
00:53:31,863 --> 00:53:35,763
We take what our morning
and let him take his him.

783
00:53:35,798 --> 00:53:37,364
We can not trust him!

784
00:53:37,401 --> 00:53:40,459
We let him go.
We honor the deal.

785
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,776
Pa, Surly,
come back soon.

786
00:53:43,812 --> 00:53:47,363
I mean, do not come back.
I do not like at all.

787
00:54:13,008 --> 00:54:16,516
Surly, gather the team?
Another robbery.

788
00:54:16,552 --> 00:54:18,147
Not the time now.

789
00:54:18,182 --> 00:54:20,540
Yes, I understand.
Not now.

790
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:22,729
How about ... now?

791
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,342
I told him no.

792
00:54:25,377 --> 00:54:27,122
The job is done,
ready and the team.

793
00:54:27,157 --> 00:54:28,470
You want to look?

794
00:54:30,561 --> 00:54:33,054
Go back to your people,
I'm on my own.

795
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:34,301
We play again, right?

796
00:54:35,390 --> 00:54:39,790
No, no, go, run away!
Look what you've done.

797
00:54:48,401 --> 00:54:49,801
I Watch </ i>

798
00:55:01,914 --> 00:55:03,763
What shall we do with him, boss?

799
00:55:04,066 --> 00:55:05,130
Shut.

800
00:55:05,165 --> 00:55:07,113
Go and bring me that lamp.

801
00:55:18,105 --> 00:55:18,905
Lana ...

802
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:21,519
Glad to see you.

803
00:55:21,554 --> 00:55:24,755
Go check tunnel.

804
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:26,852
So now you know.

805
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:29,051
When were you gonna tell me, King?

806
00:55:29,198 --> 00:55:34,895
I already said ...
You can not change what you are.

807
00:55:35,147 --> 00:55:37,147
I Chief, come here. </ i>

808
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:41,194
Go robbing the bank.

809
00:55:42,744 --> 00:55:45,437
This will be my last shot.

810
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:47,039
I Chief, come on </ i>

811
00:55:56,032 --> 00:55:58,174
It's a gold mine here,
above our heads.

812
00:55:58,770 --> 00:56:00,469
Let's give this thing in the air.

813
00:56:01,213 --> 00:56:02,412
But Lana?

814
00:56:31,984 --> 00:56:33,977
But ...
No more whistle.

815
00:56:34,127 --> 00:56:35,325
I know.

816
00:57:07,291 --> 00:57:10,080
What have we here?

817
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,427
A hero or a thief?

818
00:57:13,523 --> 00:57:16,361
You think you can starve Park
to keep him under control?

819
00:57:16,396 --> 00:57:17,962
He told me everything, Mole.

820
00:57:18,012 --> 00:57:19,677
What? What are you talking about?

821
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:20,944
I said nothing.
It jumped.

822
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:26,199
It's again one of your illusions?

823
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,225
Another revenge
pl?nuit? against me?

824
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:31,182
It's something else, is not it?

825
00:57:31,517 --> 00:57:33,218
Trying to impress.

826
00:57:33,614 --> 00:57:35,214
Grayson can ...

827
00:57:35,763 --> 00:57:36,816
Andie?

828
00:57:38,018 --> 00:57:40,968
I see ...

829
00:57:41,814 --> 00:57:43,014
It does not matter.

830
00:57:43,215 --> 00:57:46,915
My accomplices will take care of them
very soon.

831
00:57:46,965 --> 00:57:48,932
They do not follow me, hate me.

832
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:51,364
Maybe, but I can not let
no evidence, Surly.

833
00:57:51,399 --> 00:57:53,680
Any good thief knows that.

834
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:56,318
It seems a bit absurd, do not you think?

835
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,877
You might want to follow you ...

836
00:57:59,011 --> 00:58:01,813
Where's that shiny thing
that supposedly has it?

837
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:04,064
Okay, that's it ..

838
00:58:04,065 --> 00:58:06,065
Ten ... new ...

839
00:58:06,163 --> 00:58:09,559
You get the rest when finished
Andie and the others.

840
00:58:09,596 --> 00:58:12,309
Mr. "Hero"
I'll handle it myself.

841
00:58:12,357 --> 00:58:15,354
Park will banish,
will elect new leaders.

842
00:58:15,905 --> 00:58:21,250
How many leaders ... think ...
I can park?

843
00:58:22,004 --> 00:58:23,622
Three ... two ...

844
00:58:23,659 --> 00:58:24,847
One '!

845
00:58:42,384 --> 00:58:44,136
He will warn the others.

846
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:46,683
What are you waiting for?
After him!

847
00:58:56,675 --> 00:58:58,271
Bingo, guys.

848
00:58:58,771 --> 00:59:00,567
Look at all this money!

849
00:59:01,811 --> 00:59:05,701
Put the money in the truck.
Let's get out of here.

850
00:59:09,288 --> 00:59:10,601
You two ...

851
00:59:10,638 --> 00:59:13,030
Put peanuts in the vault.
See you later.

852
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:22,658
What do you get your money?

853
00:59:22,694 --> 00:59:24,017
A pet?

854
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:26,993
I take three pets.
And I d?ruiesc to you two of them.

855
00:59:27,027 --> 00:59:29,152
And a pony.
Do not forget the pony ...

856
00:59:29,384 --> 00:59:32,778
Dearly them.
They're beautiful and gentle.

857
00:59:32,813 --> 00:59:34,231
Another one.

858
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:40,112
What's going on?

859
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,510
I told them to put peanuts in the vault.

860
00:59:42,543 --> 00:59:45,547
Yes? Then you put
car of the tunnel?

861
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,746
What are you playing?

862
00:59:47,779 --> 00:59:49,145
What game do you?

863
00:59:49,539 --> 00:59:51,088
Relax.
They pushed the car out.

864
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:53,878
Or maybe they were ...

865
00:59:53,926 --> 00:59:55,273
Rats!

866
00:59:56,073 --> 00:59:57,368
God!

867
00:59:58,965 --> 01:00:01,512
- Take care!
- I'll take care of these rats.

868
01:00:13,154 --> 01:00:14,854
Squirrel!

869
01:00:23,646 --> 01:00:24,410
Get out.

870
01:00:24,445 --> 01:00:25,694
And you,
what you gonna do?

871
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:28,009
I told you to leave.

872
01:00:28,044 --> 01:00:29,443
Everything was perfect.

873
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:40,199
Grayson, you're an idiot.

874
01:00:40,233 --> 01:00:41,683
Surly, I must disguise.

875
01:00:41,717 --> 01:00:43,301
Into something spectacular.

876
01:00:43,336 --> 01:00:44,846
Cut the crap.

877
01:00:44,881 --> 01:00:48,047
Go team in the tunnel
And Run by sp?rtur?.

878
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:49,680
I distract him guy.

879
01:00:49,714 --> 01:00:52,503
I need skates,
a mustache and maybe a crank.

880
01:00:52,538 --> 01:00:54,378
You do not need cloak.

881
01:00:54,413 --> 01:00:57,590
I can not help yourself park.
I'm not a hero.

882
01:00:57,628 --> 01:00:58,890
But you are.

883
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:00,889
Last summer,
in that the heat wave ...

884
01:01:00,925 --> 01:01:03,019
Who discovered sprinklers
and everyone had water?

885
01:01:03,055 --> 01:01:04,835
- I?
- Yes, it is!

886
01:01:05,117 --> 01:01:06,814
They believe in heroes.

887
01:01:06,915 --> 01:01:09,016
So, act like a hero.

888
01:01:09,051 --> 01:01:10,404
Time for heroes.

889
01:01:10,437 --> 01:01:11,765
Time for heroes!

890
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:13,382
Why do you fear me?

891
01:01:13,417 --> 01:01:14,929
The rats!

892
01:01:14,963 --> 01:01:18,560
Rats!
Run, save your life!

893
01:01:18,593 --> 01:01:20,276
Grayson?

894
01:01:20,311 --> 01:01:21,687
He comes to save us!

895
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,001
This is our chance.
Let's go!

896
01:01:40,295 --> 01:01:42,690
Mole, what are you doing here?

897
01:01:43,096 --> 01:01:45,592
Andie.
Thank God you're here.

898
01:01:45,742 --> 01:01:46,909
Raccoon?

899
01:01:47,243 --> 01:01:49,890
Surly planning
betray us all.

900
01:01:49,927 --> 01:01:52,252
- He confessed to everything.
- What?

901
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:55,334
He said you and Mole
You tried to drowned the beavers.

902
01:01:55,369 --> 01:01:58,583
But
He works for Surly.

903
01:01:58,934 --> 01:02:00,284
What do I do?

904
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:12,972
Will you stop doing that?

905
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:19,616
Jimmy, Johnny ...

906
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:22,195
Go to the park
and bring more help.

907
01:02:22,229 --> 01:02:23,356
Yes, sir.

908
01:02:23,392 --> 01:02:25,149
- Get out of the way!
- Me first.

909
01:02:25,183 --> 01:02:27,676
Get the rest of the truck nuts.

910
01:02:27,711 --> 01:02:28,791
To the park!

911
01:02:28,826 --> 01:02:31,866
- To the park!
- Come on, guys.

912
01:02:32,463 --> 01:02:35,258
I do not want to tell me
how to spend my money. </ i>

913
01:02:35,859 --> 01:02:37,400
Look at it, Buddy!

914
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:39,842
Celebrate later.
The truck can go anytime.

915
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:41,003
Let's fight!

916
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:44,430
Raccoon, sorry
that I doubted you.

917
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,019
Raccoon I open the door </ i>

918
01:02:55,397 --> 01:02:56,597
Better go.

919
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,493
That will not change the plan.

920
01:03:03,182 --> 01:03:04,277
Fantastic!

921
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:06,422
What? It's weird!

922
01:03:17,688 --> 01:03:19,187
We go to the left.

923
01:03:22,631 --> 01:03:26,066
We need to get everybody,
out of the truck.

924
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:28,054
- Look for a way to enter.
- Follow me.

925
01:03:39,575 --> 01:03:41,269
I put it!

926
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:45,594
- I did it!
- Yes.

927
01:03:45,595 --> 01:03:48,357
- It was strangely easy.
- I'm going to take a look.

928
01:03:52,294 --> 01:03:53,639
What?

929
01:03:56,431 --> 01:03:58,324
I'm just nuts?

930
01:03:58,357 --> 01:04:00,707
- We were tricked!
- What?

931
01:04:01,442 --> 01:04:04,313
There is no money.
Rat bastards!

932
01:04:04,348 --> 01:04:05,473
A squirrel.

933
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:07,351
It's a squirrel ...

934
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:09,593
And a bird?

935
01:04:10,185 --> 01:04:12,851
It looks like they realized.

936
01:04:12,885 --> 01:04:15,424
It's time to end it
this little charades.

937
01:04:19,818 --> 01:04:21,264
Turn.

938
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:23,021
I can not see.

939
01:04:23,055 --> 01:04:24,650
At left, now!

940
01:04:42,101 --> 01:04:44,647
Annual contest cat I </ i>

941
01:04:48,883 --> 01:04:50,281
Can I do it. </ i>

942
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:53,138
Try again.

943
01:04:53,172 --> 01:04:55,072
We need Grayson!

944
01:04:59,617 --> 01:05:01,115
I contest donuts </ i>

945
01:05:05,120 --> 01:05:06,418
Grayson, you there?

946
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,116
Do not worry,

947
01:05:28,866 --> 01:05:29,879
Thank you, thank you!

948
01:05:29,915 --> 01:05:33,265
Mole. Do not play
and help us to open this door.

949
01:05:33,302 --> 01:05:35,012
Grayson, pushing me.

950
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:42,111
Grayson came to save us!

951
01:05:44,508 --> 01:05:46,432
Let me explain ...

952
01:05:46,466 --> 01:05:47,924
Wait a second ...

953
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:51,513
Leave him. The door is open.
We push the peanuts out.

954
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:53,861
Raccoon?

955
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,023
Go ahead, asshole.

956
01:05:58,057 --> 01:06:00,254
Help me throw him,
otherwise we will kill them all.

957
01:06:00,289 --> 01:06:02,067
To kill us?

958
01:06:02,102 --> 01:06:04,505
That squirrel ... is a hero.

959
01:06:05,209 --> 01:06:07,168
Almost hero, actually.

960
01:06:07,202 --> 01:06:10,201
Raccoon,
is a fucking traitor.

961
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:12,002
He's a traitor.

962
01:06:12,255 --> 01:06:13,566
Hang on, Mole!

963
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,602
What do I do?

964
01:06:17,053 --> 01:06:18,655
Why have you locked up here?

965
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:19,921
Waste time.

966
01:06:19,955 --> 01:06:22,707
That's the only time
get rid park guy.

967
01:06:23,451 --> 01:06:24,801
To the park!

968
01:06:27,097 --> 01:06:28,799
Still have not answered my question.

969
01:06:28,834 --> 01:06:30,501
- That's treason.
- No, Andie?

970
01:06:30,647 --> 01:06:32,678
Answer the question, Raccoon.

971
01:06:32,711 --> 01:06:34,702
Surly, told us the truth?

972
01:06:34,737 --> 01:06:35,848
Answer it!

973
01:06:37,448 --> 01:06:40,323
Vote, agreed.

974
01:06:40,358 --> 01:06:43,194
Raise your hands,
those guys for evacuation.

975
01:06:59,142 --> 01:07:01,095
Yes, shiny thing.

976
01:07:29,388 --> 01:07:33,584
Stay calm until we cross the border.
And then we'll be free.

977
01:07:41,388 --> 01:07:46,834
You're the thief, not Surly.
He was right about you.

978
01:07:47,182 --> 01:07:49,586
No, no, no.
We dynamite there.

979
01:08:06,681 --> 01:08:12,428
Well boys, you're surrounded.
Come out with your hands up.

980
01:08:12,464 --> 01:08:14,142
Get out, now!

981
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:16,730
I knew this would happen.

982
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:17,774
No, did not know.

983
01:08:27,277 --> 01:08:28,572
Mole, where are the others?

984
01:08:28,607 --> 01:08:29,887
Still there.

985
01:08:29,924 --> 01:08:32,039
But Andie
is in the other car with Raccoon.

986
01:08:32,075 --> 01:08:34,248
You can not stop yourself.

987
01:08:34,283 --> 01:08:36,389
Surly, I'm talking!

988
01:08:36,423 --> 01:08:38,723
I just wanted a pet.

989
01:08:38,759 --> 01:08:39,920
You will not get away with this.

990
01:08:42,075 --> 01:08:43,370
I want my pony.

991
01:08:44,072 --> 01:08:46,670
They took hostages.
Wait.

992
01:09:31,508 --> 01:09:32,274
God ...

993
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:34,657
I bet it was that squirrel.

994
01:09:34,692 --> 01:09:36,005
No more squirrels!

995
01:09:36,006 --> 1:09:38, 606
Andie? Andie?

996
01:09:43,507 --> 01:09:44,907
Surly?

997
01:10:32,645 --> 01:10:34,845
Andie? Andie?

998
01:10:40,646 --> 01:10:42,145
Can I still save money. </ i>

999
01:10:45,292 --> 01:10:49,446
What are you gonna do?
Are ? lot of money.

1000
01:10:54,497 --> 01:10:56,719
What are you trying to prove, Surly?

1001
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,369
Raccoon's unstable.

1002
01:10:58,405 --> 01:11:01,040
What is this.
Tell me.

1003
01:11:05,438 --> 01:11:07,589
Buddy!
Great friend.

1004
01:11:15,987 --> 01:11:18,785
Surly. Give it to me.

1005
01:11:31,283 --> 01:11:32,984
Not so fast, thief.

1006
01:11:35,228 --> 01:11:36,398
Look!

1007
01:11:36,431 --> 01:11:38,400
Surly and Raccoon.

1008
01:11:38,434 --> 01:11:40,433
They fall into the waterfall.
Come all.

1009
01:11:40,468 --> 01:11:42,483
Come on!

1010
01:11:48,328 --> 01:11:49,679
- Gotcha!
- Do not let go.

1011
01:11:50,878 --> 01:11:52,380
Raccoon, jump.

1012
01:11:53,978 --> 01:11:56,197
But you can save them both.
Hurry!

1013
01:11:56,231 --> 01:11:58,578
I never make a deal
worms traitors.

1014
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:04,082
- Surly falls to me.
- Buddy ...

1015
01:12:04,924 --> 01:12:08,726
What great adventure!
Almost there.

1016
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:10,728
Surly, you do not dare
I let him go.

1017
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:12,677
Sorry, Andie.

1018
01:12:12,713 --> 01:12:14,177
- What?
- No!

1019
01:12:14,178 --> 01:12:15,378
Surly not!

1020
01:12:51,068 --> 01:12:52,419
What's this?

1021
01:13:03,715 --> 01:13:04,811
Look!

1022
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:06,679
E, Grayson!

1023
01:13:06,713 --> 01:13:07,581
Thank you, thank you.

1024
01:13:07,617 --> 01:13:09,209
Do not worry, I'm fine.

1025
01:13:09,262 --> 01:13:11,778
We arrive at the park
and I give autographs.

1026
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:17,063
Jump out!

1027
01:13:20,057 --> 01:13:21,504
Grayson!

1028
01:13:39,103 --> 01:13:40,755
- Do not be afraid!
- Grayson?

1029
01:13:40,856 --> 01:13:42,656
And you're here?

1030
01:13:42,693 --> 01:13:44,103
Hello!

1031
01:13:46,651 --> 01:13:47,851
Come on, guys!

1032
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:03,268
Rats ...

1033
01:14:03,301 --> 01:14:04,601
A lot of rats!

1034
01:14:07,602 --> 01:14:09,599
Officers, save me!

1035
01:14:12,649 --> 01:14:13,998
Get me out of here, officer.

1036
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,048
Get me out of here.

1037
01:14:15,099 --> 01:14:17,100
Save me from these rats.

1038
01:14:17,504 --> 01:14:19,994
Percy King, you are a fool.

1039
01:14:20,645 --> 01:14:23,244
You and I are done.

1040
01:14:29,647 --> 01:14:32,342
Precious ...
Where are you going, girl?

1041
01:14:34,744 --> 01:14:35,494
Precious?

1042
01:14:48,742 --> 01:14:52,841
Buddy ... Come with me.

1043
01:15:21,836 --> 01:15:24,486
The best ... friend.

1044
01:15:54,474 --> 01:15:56,073
What are you staring?

1045
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,270
Wait, Buddy.
I can not ... speak.

1046
01:16:13,321 --> 01:16:15,424
Well, well, well.
Enough.

1047
01:16:17,156 --> 01:16:18,873
Precious!

1048
01:16:20,872 --> 01:16:23,234
Well, Surly ...

1049
01:16:23,268 --> 01:16:24,371
See the store of nuts.

1050
01:16:24,405 --> 01:16:25,887
Wait, what? There?

1051
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,367
Yes.
Lana's new owner.

1052
01:16:28,403 --> 01:16:30,772
And no more whistles.
Only lins?turi.

1053
01:16:32,118 --> 01:16:33,716
Hi, Andie!

1054
01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:35,915
Surly!

1055
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:47,067
When you fell in the waterfall,
I thought I'll never see.

1056
01:16:48,766 --> 01:16:49,932
You go, come on!

1057
01:16:49,966 --> 01:16:51,032
Relax.
Where are we going?

1058
01:16:51,068 --> 01:16:53,162
You risked your life
as to save this park.

1059
01:16:53,458 --> 01:16:54,360
You know all.

1060
01:16:54,395 --> 01:16:58,761
Do not ...
The team saved the park.

1061
01:17:01,711 --> 01:17:04,663
I do not touch the tail,
Stop. </ i>

1062
01:17:07,058 --> 01:17:08,911
What will you do now?

1063
01:17:10,358 --> 01:17:12,707
I will continue to look for food
for this park.

1064
01:17:12,741 --> 01:17:16,311
But from now on,
we do together.

1065
01:17:16,346 --> 01:17:18,158
Agree?

1066
01:17:18,557 --> 01:17:21,107
This park his respects
always promises Surly.
