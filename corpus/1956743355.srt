2054
01:22:22,534 --> 01:22:24,666
You're in a movie!

2055
01:22:25,537 --> 01:22:27,626
[LAUGHING]

2056
01:22:27,669 --> 01:22:29,193
What were you thinking?

2057
01:22:29,236 --> 01:22:31,064
I was thinking somebody
was coming after him,

2058
01:22:31,108 --> 01:22:32,544
and they was gonna come
after me right away.

2059
01:22:32,587 --> 01:22:34,415
I'm like, "Oh, I have to hide
under the table."

2060
01:22:34,459 --> 01:22:35,547
[LAUGHTER]

2061
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:40,378
I'm just
a typical white chick.

2062
01:22:40,421 --> 01:22:42,684
MAN: [ON RADIO] Got the number and the name

2063
01:22:42,728 --> 01:22:43,859
of a honky-tonk bar.

2064
01:22:43,903 --> 01:22:46,297
Shit. You scared
the shit outta me, dude.

2065
01:22:46,340 --> 01:22:48,516
KITAO SAKURAI: Make sure

2066
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:49,691

2067
01:22:49,735 --> 01:22:51,345

you're making eye contact.

2072
01:22:59,571 --> 01:23:02,356
Like, you're just like,
"Who's next."

2073
01:23:02,400 --> 01:23:05,229
- [APPLAUSE]
- You guys are in a movie.

2074
01:23:07,492 --> 01:23:10,103
- You guys are in a movie.
- [LAUGHING]

2075
01:23:10,147 --> 01:23:11,670
I had no idea
y'all was shooting a movie.

2076
01:23:12,932 --> 01:23:16,631
I ought to beat your butt.
Oh, my God.

2077
01:23:16,675 --> 01:23:18,329
Hey, man, you're a hero.

2078
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:19,852
Hey, man, I was just trying
to make sure everything's...

2079
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:21,332
You're a goddamn hero.
You're a goddamn hero.

2080
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:23,725
Thanks for doing
the movie, buddy.

2081
01:23:23,769 --> 01:23:24,944
They should've
probably put, like,

2082
01:23:24,987 --> 01:23:26,728
a towel over this
when we ain't filming.

2083
01:23:26,772 --> 01:23:28,382
It's a buddy film.

2084
01:23:28,426 --> 01:23:29,427
ANDREÉ: Thank you.
Thank you, folks.

2085
01:23:29,470 --> 01:23:30,558
TIFFANY HADDISH: Hey!

2086
01:23:30,602 --> 01:23:32,125

2087
01:23:32,169 --> 01:23:33,561
You are so good.

2088
01:23:33,605 --> 01:23:37,174
- You're an angel.
- I didn't know what to do.

2089
01:23:37,217 --> 01:23:38,566
HADDISH: You was doing
a good job.

2090
01:23:38,610 --> 01:23:39,828
But y'all just standing there,

2091
01:23:39,872 --> 01:23:41,395
y'all weren't even trying
to help or nothing.

2092
01:23:41,439 --> 01:23:42,788
Because y'all scared as hell.

2093
01:23:42,831 --> 01:23:43,702
Y'all just
standing there like...

2094
01:23:43,745 --> 01:23:45,269
[LAUGHS]

2095
01:23:45,312 --> 01:23:46,748
- I know.
- WOMAN: That ain't right.

2096
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:48,272
You ain't right.

2097
01:23:48,315 --> 01:23:51,231
You was gonna let me
kill this black man.

2098
01:23:51,275 --> 01:23:52,841
I always wanted to talk
to her, you know what I...

2099
01:23:52,885 --> 01:23:54,626
Oh, shit. Oh, my God.

2100
01:23:54,669 --> 01:23:56,889
Oh, shit! What the fuck?
[GRUNTS]

2101
01:23:57,759 --> 01:23:58,760
What the fuck?

2102
01:23:59,718 --> 01:24:00,719
What happened?

2103
01:24:02,286 --> 01:24:04,418
What in the fuck happened?

2104
01:24:04,462 --> 01:24:06,420
- What did you do?
- Okay. You're naked, man.

2105
01:24:06,464 --> 01:24:07,769
Hey, Craig.

2106
01:24:07,813 --> 01:24:09,423
CRAIG:
You're selling it, woman.

2107
01:24:09,467 --> 01:24:11,512
You're selling it.

2108
01:24:11,556 --> 01:24:13,775
That is awesome.

2109
01:24:13,819 --> 01:24:15,821
- That blew my mind.
- [LAUGHTER]

2110
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,607
MALE CUSTOMER:
They've caught us on film.

2111
01:24:20,478 --> 01:24:21,827
MAN: Good job, guys.

2112
01:24:21,870 --> 01:24:24,612
I just saw this girl
snatch a door off a cop car.

2113
01:24:24,656 --> 01:24:26,310
[LAUGHS]

2114
01:24:26,353 --> 01:24:28,225
And I was wondering.
I was like, "She's strong."

2115
01:24:29,487 --> 01:24:32,446
That's wrong. You better
get my good side too.

2116
01:24:32,490 --> 01:24:33,752
ANDREÉ: Did you think
I was, like...

2117
01:24:33,795 --> 01:24:35,623
Did you think I was,
like, schizophrenic?

2118
01:24:35,667 --> 01:24:37,321
I thought you were fucked up.

2119
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:38,887
[ALL LAUGH]

2120
01:24:38,931 --> 01:24:39,801
Three...

2121
01:24:43,327 --> 01:24:44,458
Four...

2122
01:24:45,633 --> 01:24:46,852
