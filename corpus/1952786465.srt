00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:29,468
We have
a big problem here, girls.

2
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,370
Your behavior is
completely unacceptable.

3
00:00:36,483 --> 00:00:38,678
Mr. Connor...

4
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,550
Did we do something wrong?

5
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:42,782
The three of you have
been disrupting my class

6
00:00:42,823 --> 00:00:44,654
and you're making it difficult
for the students

7
00:00:44,691 --> 00:00:46,989
who actually want
to learn something.

8
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,419
Not only am l going
to call your parents,

9
00:00:50,464 --> 00:00:52,523
but you all have detention.

10
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:56,960
Not only am l gonna
call your parents...

11
00:00:57,003 --> 00:00:59,062
But you all have detention.

12

You've got detention
You've got detention

13

You girls think this is funny?

14
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:10,615
No, Jim!

15
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,585
l don't find anything
funny about this.

16
00:01:14,821 --> 00:01:15,981
l wasn't finished!

17
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:18,790
Put these on!

18
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:21,123
l don't think these
are appropriate to wear here.

19
00:01:21,161 --> 00:01:24,255
You fucking imbecile,
did l stutter?!

20
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:25,559
l said put 'em on.

21
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,226
This is outrageous!

22
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:30,395
l'm just trying to give
you girls a good education!

23
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:31,665
Ooooh...

24
00:01:31,705 --> 00:01:36,199
We'll give you
a good education...

25
00:01:36,243 --> 00:01:38,370
ADULT education!

26
00:01:38,712 --> 00:01:39,906
Just let me go!

27
00:01:39,946 --> 00:01:41,811
Somebody really needs detention.

28
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,820
That was fun, right?

29
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:50,084
Yeah, that was crazy.

30
00:01:50,123 --> 00:01:52,353
l love it when it's
the three of us together.

31
00:01:52,392 --> 00:01:55,122
lt's like Charlie's Angels,
look out!

32
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:57,626
More like Hells Angels.

33
00:01:57,664 --> 00:01:59,063
And Natalie...

34
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,092
that dildo was way too big
to use on him like that.

35
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,502
But l think he liked it
the way he was moaning.

36
00:02:05,539 --> 00:02:07,097
You think he liked it?

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,471
Who cares.
l liked it.

38
00:02:10,043 --> 00:02:11,340
Are you girls hungry?

39
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:15,405
So hungry l could eat
the balls off a snake right now.

40
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,283
You know, l have the strangest
craving for foie gras.

41
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,219
Eew! That's nasty!

42
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,814
The way they force-feed
those poor little geese -

43
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:25,586
it's animal cruelty, you know.

44
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:28,150
Honey, you the last one to
be talking about animal cruelty

45
00:02:28,195 --> 00:02:29,924
after what you just
did to that poor man.

46
00:02:31,198 --> 00:02:32,256
Ashtray.

47
00:02:36,803 --> 00:02:38,600

00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:47,171
- Hey V.
- Hey.

53
00:02:47,647 --> 00:02:49,342
Do l have any new bookings?

54
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:52,840
You have Tony at 3 o'clock...

You have a 4:30

and heavy bondage,

57
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:00,619
and Karen and her
husband want to push to 7.

58
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,992
- Can you e-mail me that to me?
- Sure.

59
00:03:03,029 --> 00:03:04,621
Jim should be ready.

60
00:03:04,664 --> 00:03:07,827
Let me write him up
so you can get out of here.

61
00:03:07,868 --> 00:03:09,768
All right, we got
an all-girl gang bang,

62
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:13,534
CBT, nipple, humiliation -
verbal and physical -

63
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,700
foot fetish, spitting,
forced fem,

64
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,710
rape fantasy, heavy cursing...

65
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:20,907
Ah! Face slapping...

basic trampling and a golden.

68
00:03:26,653 --> 00:03:27,847
Any takers?

69
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,355
Nah, l'm good.

70
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:31,888
l'll do it.

71
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,916
All right.
Don't do nothing l wouldn't do.

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,086
Later, beauties.

73
00:03:35,562 --> 00:03:37,689

in 20 minutes.

Hi, Mommy.

82

Sure, l'd love to.

83
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:36,745
OK...

84
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:37,807
l'll see you later.

85
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,624
Natalie, l think you should
go back to being blond

86
00:05:52,666 --> 00:05:54,258
or at least put some blond
highlights in your hair.

87
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,767
lt looked so beautiful that way.

88
00:05:55,802 --> 00:05:58,100
Thanks, Ma, but the bleach
dried out my hair.

89
00:05:58,138 --> 00:05:59,230
l like it better natural.

90
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:01,137
Ma, she looks
beautiful the way she is.

91
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,436
l know she does.

92
00:06:03,476 --> 00:06:05,103
What's going on with your hair?

93
00:06:05,145 --> 00:06:06,510
l just got it cut this morning.

94
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:07,877
lt's a little too short,
isn't it?

95
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:09,506
l mean, just don't go
any shorter.

96
00:06:09,549 --> 00:06:12,017
l've been getting my hair cut
like this for a year.

97
00:06:12,052 --> 00:06:13,747
Nat, you think it's too short?

98
00:06:13,787 --> 00:06:17,120
No, it looks real cute.
l like that dykie look.

99
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:18,181
What?

100
00:06:18,224 --> 00:06:20,317
l mean, if l saw you
on the street

101
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,260
l'd definitely think
you were gay.

102
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:30,296
Natalie, not everybody
sees things the way you do.

103
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:31,803
Maybe it's not about the hair.

104
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,203
Then what is it?

105
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,867
You know what it is?

106
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:38,776
lt's the hair with the clothes,
it's the way you carry yourself.

107
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:40,370
Everything about you screams,

108

''l don't need a man.''

109
00:06:42,282 --> 00:06:45,046
Some people might
confuse that with being gay.

110
00:06:46,119 --> 00:06:48,587
Well, just because l don't
walk around town

111
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:51,488
with long, red, flowing hair
and my tits and ass hanging out,

112
00:06:51,524 --> 00:06:53,151

C'mon, Becca, forgive me,

Well, that's something new.

Now, l know you don't
wanna hear this,

134

but l think it would be nice
if one of you young ladies

135
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:49,474
would just start to think
about settling down

136

l don't know what time it is.

She turned the extra room
into a dungeon

work done on the side.

Why can't we go
to a straight club?

180
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:48,090
Because we're lesbians.

181

We ready to get outta here?

360
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:22,544
Noah, you do know we're goin'
to a lesbian club?

361
00:18:22,581 --> 00:18:23,707
Hell, yeah!

362
00:18:23,749 --> 00:18:25,683
Some of my best motherfuckin'
clients is up in there.

363
00:18:25,718 --> 00:18:27,242
The herb has no problem

with da
girl-on-girl action, mon!

365
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:31,422
Don't matter if you're
black, white, red or brown.

366
00:18:31,457 --> 00:18:34,187
As long as you got cash,
you can all be down.

367
00:18:34,226 --> 00:18:35,750
Woo! That shit is tight!

368
00:19:31,984 --> 00:19:34,179
l can connect with
my feminine side,

369
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:38,281
which allows me an ethereal
connection with lesbians, so...

[phone ringing]

371
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:03,188
Hi, Natalie.
lt's your Grandma.

372
00:23:03,228 --> 00:23:06,493
Sara's friend's son,
he's a nice Jewish boy.

373
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:08,193
We want you to meet him.

374
00:23:08,233 --> 00:23:09,962
You're not so young anymore.

375
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,993
You should live to 1 20.

376
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:16,666
Damn, ma...

377
00:23:16,709 --> 00:23:19,610
You still got
an answering machine?

378
00:23:22,047 --> 00:23:23,844
You got a beeper too?

379
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:28,913
lt's for my grandmother.

380
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:31,548
She just figured out
how to leave a message.

381
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,154
You are a lesbian, right?

382
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:45,298
Couldn't you tell?

383
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:52,401
Oh, shit...

384
00:23:54,379 --> 00:23:56,176
l'm sorry.

385
00:23:56,215 --> 00:23:57,614
ls this some kind of sign?

386
00:23:57,649 --> 00:24:00,083
l just met you and you're
already bleeding on me?

387
00:24:00,119 --> 00:24:02,178
l'm so embarrassed.
l'll clean it up.

388
00:24:02,221 --> 00:24:03,654
l'll get it.

389
00:24:08,994 --> 00:24:10,393
You want somethin' to drink?

390
00:24:10,429 --> 00:24:11,691
Do you have a tampon?

391
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:13,391
ln the cabinet, under the sink.

392
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,625
Where are we, anyway?

393
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,329
Lower East Side.

394
00:24:32,618 --> 00:24:34,381
So, l'll call you.

395
00:24:34,987 --> 00:24:36,648

[phone rings]

397
00:24:48,233 --> 00:24:49,063
Hello?

398
00:24:49,101 --> 00:24:50,693
- Hey.
- Hey.

399
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:52,294
What a surprise.

400
00:24:52,337 --> 00:24:54,703
l didn't expect to
hear from you so soon.

401
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,401
Yeah, l know.

402
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,671
The rules and all...
but l just wanted to say

403
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,110
l had a really good time
with you last night.

404
00:25:01,146 --> 00:25:03,307
Yeah, me too.

405
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,615
Bye.

406
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:20,129
So, how was it last night?

407
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:22,599
AKA, this morning?

408
00:25:22,634 --> 00:25:25,262
And don't leave out
the hot details.

409
00:25:25,304 --> 00:25:27,966
Well, put it this way...

410
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:31,134
she ate my cookies
until the box was empty.

411
00:25:31,176 --> 00:25:33,144
Now that's what
l'm talking about!

412
00:25:33,178 --> 00:25:35,408
l won't get with a chick
if the sex ain't right!

413
00:25:35,447 --> 00:25:36,914
lt's all about the pussy!

414
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,746
That's the real way
to a woman's heart.

415
00:25:38,784 --> 00:25:41,048
True. l'm definitely
gonna see her again.

416
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:42,348
Well, hell yeah!

417
00:25:42,387 --> 00:25:46,050
You'd better see her...
before someone else sees her.

418
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:48,523
The Viking Killer.

419
00:25:48,827 --> 00:25:51,796
Very useful if you're
trying to stretch him out.

420
00:25:53,799 --> 00:25:55,232
Does she know you're a domme?

421
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:55,926
Nah.

422
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,993
That shouldn't be a problem.
She seems mad chill.

423
00:25:58,036 --> 00:25:59,196
l don't know, babe,

424
00:25:59,238 --> 00:26:01,604
usually it's only
a matter of time...

425
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,006
unless you find someone
who thinks it's normal.

426
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,934
Who would think this is normal?

427
00:26:06,979 --> 00:26:08,742
l do.

428
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:12,308
Yeah, but eventually
l wanna have

429
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:15,184
a serious and
normal relationship.

430
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:16,881
With a girl, of course.

431
00:26:16,922 --> 00:26:19,482
You just need someone
that's open-minded.

432
00:26:19,524 --> 00:26:21,583
Or a domme who understands.

433
00:26:22,794 --> 00:26:26,230
We are doing exactly
what we want to be doing.

434
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:28,028
How many people can say that?

435
00:26:28,066 --> 00:26:30,000
That's true, but...

436
00:26:30,035 --> 00:26:31,730
l don't think l'm
gonna be doin' this

437
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:33,169
for too much longer.

438
00:26:33,205 --> 00:26:35,173
l want to go back
to nursing school,

439
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:38,176
and l wanna have
a wifey and a kid.

440
00:26:39,211 --> 00:26:40,769
Really?

441
00:26:40,812 --> 00:26:43,337
l could see that.
You'd be a cute mommy.

442
00:26:43,382 --> 00:26:44,747
Yeah.

443
00:26:45,751 --> 00:26:49,482
But for now just remember,
we're alternative therapists.

444
00:26:49,521 --> 00:26:52,979
And this is our
contribution to society, right?

445

Hey, hey, hey!

448
00:27:03,869 --> 00:27:04,836
Hi.

449
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:08,839
Got some presents for you.

450
00:27:12,778 --> 00:27:15,338

451
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,472

452
00:27:19,584 --> 00:27:21,677
- You wanna stay?
- Hell, yeah.

453
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:25,681
What's up with that
little dime piece

454
00:27:25,724 --> 00:27:27,214

455
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:28,283
You in love yet?

456
00:27:28,327 --> 00:27:29,351
Shut the fuck up.

457
00:27:29,394 --> 00:27:31,191
You know how you lez out
at lighting speed.

458
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,028
What's up with your script?

What's it about?

462
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:42,598
lt's kind of
a 'slice of life' thing...

463
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:46,077
about being happy
and an individual.

464
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:47,635
ls that it?

465
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,806
- Yeah.
- Cool.

466
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,786

with some dialogue.

What, what?

468
00:28:07,432 --> 00:28:08,660
That's pretty funny.

469
00:28:09,634 --> 00:28:11,966
But a woman
wouldn't say it like that.

470
00:28:12,004 --> 00:28:13,403
That sounds like a dude.

471
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,529
Do you mind?

472
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:17,735
No, go ahead.

473
00:28:32,491 --> 00:28:33,753
That's tight.

474
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,858
How about we change
this whole scene?

475
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:44,095
Yeah, l was thinkin'

476
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:45,569
we should have her
shit on him.

477

'cuz l ain't never seen that
in a movie before.

00:31:36,441 --> 00:31:38,432
l mean, you don't seem
like the type.

539
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:39,340
What type is that?

540
00:31:39,377 --> 00:31:40,344
l don't know.

541
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:41,845
l just imagined
old German women

542
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,007
with big tattoos and piercings.

543
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:49,619
OK...
Well, you gonna tie me up,

544
00:31:49,654 --> 00:31:51,679
spank me,
and call me Shirley?

545
00:32:14,846 --> 00:32:16,905
Where do you find
these fucking actors -

546
00:32:16,948 --> 00:32:18,313
in the mental home?

547
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,942
Jesus Christ!

548
00:32:19,985 --> 00:32:22,283
You call yourself
a casting director?

549
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,515
l need these people in a week!

550
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,689
[knock on door]

551
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:27,589
Excuse me.

552
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,785

Commodities is here.

00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:32,296

00:32:39,904 --> 00:32:42,304

559
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,604
By the way...
it's Michael.

560
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,041

561
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:48,909

00:32:53,818 --> 00:32:55,718
We got the Af-Gooey.

565
00:32:55,754 --> 00:32:58,052
And that right there

567
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:01,356
Hey!

568
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:03,327
What did l tell you
about knocking?

569
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,350
Sorry.

570
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,864
Can l...um, have some?

571
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:10,594
Only because you
look so delicious.

572
00:33:10,635 --> 00:33:12,193
Try the Purple Sour O.G Kush.

573
00:33:12,237 --> 00:33:14,467
lt'll ease whatever
pain that ails you, or--

574
00:33:14,506 --> 00:33:16,167
Or my money back?

575
00:33:17,142 --> 00:33:18,632
How about dinner?

576
00:33:18,677 --> 00:33:20,304
l'll let you know.

577
00:33:23,014 --> 00:33:24,538
Sick body, right?

578
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,311
You should see her naked!

579
00:33:26,351 --> 00:33:28,114
You wouldn't know
what to do with that, bro.

580
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,279
You 'da man!

581
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:30,219
Yeah?

582
00:33:30,255 --> 00:33:32,120
Do l get the same guarantee?

583
00:33:32,157 --> 00:33:33,886
l play for the home team...

584
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:35,756
You know my shit
is always guaranteed.

585
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:37,659
Whatever.
Just get the fuck out of here.

586
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,493
Some of us have
some real work to do.

587
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:42,466
All right...
Look, Mike...

588
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,296
Forgive me...

589
00:33:43,335 --> 00:33:45,064
l know you must get
this all the time,

590
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,799
but l got this
great idea for a script.

591
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh, great. Another script.
Just what l need.

592
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:51,906
lt's in the beginning stages,
but l was hopin'

593
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,501
you'd take look at it
when l'm finished.

594
00:33:53,545 --> 00:33:54,842
Finish?

595
00:33:54,879 --> 00:33:58,110
lf you ever finish,
it'll get thrown onto a pile

596
00:33:58,149 --> 00:34:00,617
with a million other scripts
after a million re-writes

597
00:34:00,652 --> 00:34:03,246
and then some sweet-ass
little intern will read it

598
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:05,916
and steal your fucking idea!

599
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,925
Look, Nomar--

600
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:09,324
Noah.

601
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:10,851
l know.

602
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,829
You're always on time
and your weed's pretty good,

603
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,058
so stick to your day job

604
00:34:14,099 --> 00:34:15,930
and leave the movie making
to us professionals!

605
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:17,264
OK, Spike Lee?

606
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:20,136
OK.

607
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:22,435
Success and nothin' less,
my man.

608
00:34:22,474 --> 00:34:23,600
Yeah, whatever.

609
00:34:27,112 --> 00:34:28,943
Close the fucking door!

610
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:30,607
Were you born in a tent?

611
00:34:33,151 --> 00:34:34,880
Close the door!

612
00:34:40,692 --> 00:34:42,592
And then it got stuck.

613
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,060
Stuck?

614
00:34:44,095 --> 00:34:45,494
Up his ass.

615
00:34:46,865 --> 00:34:48,560
l hate stickys.

616
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:51,160
He was jumping up and down
and everything,

617
00:34:51,202 --> 00:34:53,363
but his ass just
swallowed it whole.

618
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:55,032
Did you try the forceps?

619
00:34:55,073 --> 00:34:57,837
Of course.
lt was in way too deep.

620
00:34:57,876 --> 00:35:00,470
Birthing position?
Squatting position?

621
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,844
- Hospital?
- Had to.

622
00:35:02,881 --> 00:35:04,246
St. Vincent's or Roosevelt?

623
00:35:04,282 --> 00:35:05,510
St. Vincent's...

624
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:08,075
They have a lot of experience
with this type of thing.

625
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:10,019
OK, this is disgusting.

626
00:35:10,054 --> 00:35:11,954
Honey, they love it.

627
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:14,151
Damn, these dudes will have
you do anything they want.

628
00:35:14,192 --> 00:35:15,523
You got it twisted.

629
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,653
Even if they come in
for something specific,

630
00:35:17,695 --> 00:35:19,162
l just figure out
their weakness

631
00:35:19,197 --> 00:35:21,097
and get them to do
whatever l want.

632
00:35:21,132 --> 00:35:22,497
So let me get this straight.

633
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,092
They tell you
what they want,

634
00:35:24,135 --> 00:35:25,659
but then you don't do it?

635
00:35:25,703 --> 00:35:28,137
Well, every Mistress
has her methods.

636
00:35:28,173 --> 00:35:29,800
l like to expand their horizons.

637
00:35:29,841 --> 00:35:31,103
You're doin'
a whole lot more

638
00:35:31,142 --> 00:35:32,609
than expanding their horizons.

639
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:34,236
They love this shit.

640
00:35:34,279 --> 00:35:36,474
lt sounds like you all love it.

641
00:35:36,514 --> 00:35:37,879
They love it!

642
00:35:37,916 --> 00:35:40,544
l just think we're all goddesses
and men should be serving us.

643
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:42,849
- Amen.
- Yeah!

644
00:35:42,887 --> 00:35:44,115
Yeah!

645
00:35:57,969 --> 00:35:59,493
OK, great.

646
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,004
l'll see you tomorrow.

647
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:02,336
Thanks so much.

648
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:06,601
What's up, mama?

649
00:36:06,644 --> 00:36:07,906
l just got an interview

650
00:36:07,946 --> 00:36:10,107
to possibly intern
on a feature film tomorrow.

651
00:36:10,849 --> 00:36:12,339
Ooh!

652
00:36:12,383 --> 00:36:15,045
Oh, my God.
l'm so happy for you.

653
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:16,984
Good luck.

654
00:36:17,388 --> 00:36:18,753
Thanks.

655
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:21,156
lf l get it, we'll have
to celebrate this weekend.

656
00:36:22,861 --> 00:36:26,228
Well, l just hope
you put some money aside,

657
00:36:26,264 --> 00:36:27,856
'cuz, you know...

658
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:29,764
being a domme spoils you.

659
00:36:29,801 --> 00:36:31,530
l mean...

660
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:33,127
You are gonna make
in a week

661
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:35,969
what you can make
in an hour doing this.

662
00:36:36,007 --> 00:36:39,101
That's why eventually,
everyone comes back.

663
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:42,374
Yeah, l know, but...
l gotta try.

664
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:45,678
And you are trying!
That's awesome.

665
00:36:45,717 --> 00:36:49,084
But when you do come back,

666
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:54,854
l'll be here to welcome you
and tell you it's OK.

667
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:57,191
l never said l was quitting...

668
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,525
Just takin' a break.

669
00:37:00,031 --> 00:37:03,467
He said he wants
to be mummified!

670
00:37:03,501 --> 00:37:05,298
What should l do?!

671
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:07,031
Wrap him up in Saran Wrap.

672
00:37:07,071 --> 00:37:09,164
Waist up first,
then the bottom half.

673
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,072
Just remember to cut
air holes for the head.

674
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,235
Tape 'em up.

675
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:15,906
Oh...OK.
Thanks.

676
00:37:20,852 --> 00:37:22,342
Wow...

677
00:37:22,387 --> 00:37:24,753
You look amazing,
you little shit.

678
00:37:24,789 --> 00:37:26,381
Thanks.

679
00:37:26,424 --> 00:37:28,016
lt doesn't even look like me.

680
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,754
No, it doesn't!

681
00:37:29,794 --> 00:37:31,159
What are you wearing?

682
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:32,924
Fetish gear.

683
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:35,455
Oh, my God.

684
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,263
Has Mommy seen this yet?

685
00:37:37,302 --> 00:37:39,270
Yeah. She wants a copy.

686
00:37:43,374 --> 00:37:45,365
So who's this new girl
you're in love with?

687
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,901
- What new girl?
- Oh, c'mon.

688
00:37:47,946 --> 00:37:49,971
Her name is Jasmine.

689
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:52,676
She's wonderful.
l met her at Juicy's.

690
00:37:52,717 --> 00:37:54,685
Does she know what you do?

691
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:56,914
Yeah. She doesn't care.

692
00:37:58,356 --> 00:37:59,983
Really?

693
00:38:01,826 --> 00:38:03,487
That's great.

694
00:38:17,976 --> 00:38:19,341
Hey!

695
00:38:19,978 --> 00:38:21,570
l got hung up at work.

696
00:38:21,813 --> 00:38:22,905
OK.

697
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:26,213
Are you OK?

698
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,274
Yeah.

699
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:29,078
You sure?

700
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,018
Yeah.

701
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:32,486
What's up?

702
00:38:32,523 --> 00:38:33,512
Nothin.

703
00:38:37,562 --> 00:38:38,927
A'ight.

704
00:38:38,963 --> 00:38:40,828
You know
l'm feelin' you, right?

705
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,389
Yeah.

706
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:45,266
When l met you
l didn't think l'd care,

707
00:38:45,303 --> 00:38:46,998
but the more l'm feelin' you

708
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:49,233
the more it's starting
to bother me.

709
00:38:49,273 --> 00:38:51,002
l don't know how long
l can deal with

710
00:38:51,042 --> 00:38:53,101
this stuff that you do.

711
00:38:53,144 --> 00:38:55,203
lt's fuckin' with my head.

712
00:38:55,246 --> 00:38:56,611
Really?

713
00:38:56,648 --> 00:38:58,047
Yeah.

714
00:38:58,716 --> 00:39:00,547
Do you like it?

715
00:39:00,585 --> 00:39:04,043
l mean, do you get off on it
or is just your job?

716
00:39:04,088 --> 00:39:06,022
To be honest...

717
00:39:06,057 --> 00:39:08,491
it's a little of all three.

718
00:39:08,526 --> 00:39:11,017
Look, it's what l do.

719
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:15,092
lt's what l chose to do
way before l met you.

720
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:15,997
l know.

721
00:39:16,034 --> 00:39:17,331
l'm just tryin'
to be honest with you

722
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:18,960
and tell you how l feel.

723
00:39:19,003 --> 00:39:22,461
And l want you to be honest,
but don't judge me.

724
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:24,202
No. no. l'm not.

725
00:39:24,242 --> 00:39:26,335
l think you're really
creative and smart.

726
00:39:26,377 --> 00:39:28,242
l feel like there's so much
more to you

727
00:39:28,279 --> 00:39:30,372
than just beating
men's asses...

728
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:32,940
Even though most men
need their asses beat.

729
00:39:32,984 --> 00:39:35,077
But you know what l'm sayin'.

730
00:39:36,721 --> 00:39:39,121
Look, Noah's hooking me
up on a job

731
00:39:39,157 --> 00:39:42,285
one of his customers
is directing.

732
00:39:42,326 --> 00:39:43,884
Are you serious?

733
00:39:43,928 --> 00:39:46,226
Why didn't you tell me?
That's what l'm talkin' about.

734
00:39:46,264 --> 00:39:48,323
lt's just as an intern.
l'm not even hired yet.

735
00:39:48,366 --> 00:39:50,197
No, but you're on your way!

736
00:39:50,234 --> 00:39:51,394
Yes!

737
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,901
[machine beeps]
Natalie...

738
00:39:57,942 --> 00:40:01,776
He said he called you
but you're not calling him back.

739
00:40:01,813 --> 00:40:03,280
What's going on?

740
00:40:03,314 --> 00:40:06,579
l wanna live long enough
to be a great-grandmother.

741
00:40:06,617 --> 00:40:08,517
Why aren't you calling him back?

742
00:40:08,553 --> 00:40:09,747
What's good, baby girl?

743
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:11,084
Noah!

744
00:40:11,122 --> 00:40:13,090
Thank you so much
for hooking that up.

745
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,648
- All right.
- l hope l get it.

746
00:40:14,692 --> 00:40:16,990
We'll see if you thank me
after you meet him.

747
00:40:17,028 --> 00:40:18,495
He's a real dickhead.

748
00:40:18,529 --> 00:40:20,190
Whatever, l'm sure
l can handle him.

749
00:40:20,231 --> 00:40:21,323
All right.

750
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:22,832
How bad can he be?

751
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:27,902
You got somethin' new?

752
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:28,963
Yeah.

753
00:40:29,006 --> 00:40:32,169
l was thinkin' that Natalie
needs to be more vulnerable.

754
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,177
You understand?

755
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,202
Like, we have to have her
learn something.

756
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:37,111
Dude, we have to
change her name.

757
00:40:37,148 --> 00:40:39,412
- Why?
- Because that's what you do.

758
00:40:39,450 --> 00:40:41,748
You don't use your own name
in a movie based on yourself.

759
00:40:41,786 --> 00:40:43,981
l wanna use my name.
l'm proud of my shit.

760
00:40:44,021 --> 00:40:45,579
lt's unprofessional.

761
00:40:46,858 --> 00:40:48,018
Done.

762
00:40:49,594 --> 00:40:52,119
l can not wait till we get
this shit in the can.

763
00:40:52,163 --> 00:40:53,687
l can stop sellin' weed,

764
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:55,699
you could stop
beatin' dudes up.

765
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:56,927
l like beating dudes up.

766
00:40:56,968 --> 00:40:58,196
And l like selling weed.

767
00:40:58,236 --> 00:41:00,500
But l do see bigger
and better things for us.

768
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:02,836
Let me see if l can
get this internship first.

769
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,034
All right, cool.
l like that.

770
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,872
Baby steps...
baby steps!

771
00:41:07,044 --> 00:41:08,011
You ready?

772
00:41:08,045 --> 00:41:09,672
Yeah, come on.
Next scene.

773
00:41:13,751 --> 00:41:17,448
[alarm clock buzzing]

774
00:41:20,358 --> 00:41:22,326
Nobody should
be up at this time.

775
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,227
lt's OK, baby.
l'm gonna make you breakfast.

776
00:41:25,963 --> 00:41:27,430
You're so cute.

777
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:30,298
We gotta get up
and take a shower.

778
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:32,632
l'll make you some coffee
and some eggs.

779
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:43,875
So, are you nervous?

780
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:46,349
Nah, l'm fine,
kind of excited.

781
00:41:47,251 --> 00:41:49,845
l really appreciate you tryin'.

782
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:52,082
l didn't even do anything yet.

783
00:41:56,794 --> 00:41:58,421
All right, l am
a little bit nervous.

784
00:41:58,462 --> 00:42:00,259
You wanna meet me at Meow Mix
for a drink later?

785
00:42:00,298 --> 00:42:01,560
l think l'm gonna need it.

786
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:03,726
Stop trippin.
You'll be fine.

787
00:42:03,768 --> 00:42:05,429
And yes, l'll meet you.

788
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:06,731
l gotta go.

789
00:42:06,771 --> 00:42:09,501
Try not to start directing
on your first day.

790
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:11,508
Direct? Fuck that!

791
00:42:11,542 --> 00:42:12,634
l wanna produce!

792
00:42:16,681 --> 00:42:18,444
- Bye.
- Knock 'em dead!

793
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:31,992
Hey...

794
00:42:32,029 --> 00:42:33,792
Uh, do you know
where l can find Omar?

[chain saw revving]

796
00:43:12,036 --> 00:43:14,163
No! No!

797
00:43:15,072 --> 00:43:16,300
Cut!

798
00:43:17,174 --> 00:43:19,267
Cut! Cut! Cut!

799
00:43:19,644 --> 00:43:20,941
Who the fuck tied her up?

800
00:43:20,978 --> 00:43:22,878
l did.
Let me try again. Sorry.

801
00:43:22,914 --> 00:43:24,404
Jesus Christ!

802
00:43:28,486 --> 00:43:29,282
No, no, no!

803
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,083
Get outta here,
you milk toast motherfucker!

804
00:43:31,122 --> 00:43:32,589
Jesus Christ!

805
00:43:32,623 --> 00:43:34,989
Doesn't anybody know how
to tie a fucking knot?

806
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,525
l could do it.

807
00:43:37,561 --> 00:43:38,528
Who the hell are you?

808
00:43:38,562 --> 00:43:39,961
l'm Natalie, a P.A.

809
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:41,624
l've been bringing you
coffee all day.

810
00:43:41,666 --> 00:43:43,031
Really?

811
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:44,591
Well, sure, give it a shot.

812
00:44:11,195 --> 00:44:12,992
So what do you guys think?

813
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:15,590
l am very impressed.

814
00:44:15,633 --> 00:44:18,329
And maybe you've got some other
skills that we could explore.

815
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:21,304
Just glad to help.

816
00:44:22,606 --> 00:44:24,073
Hmm, chill.

817
00:44:24,108 --> 00:44:25,507
She's got ambition.
l like it.

818
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:26,475
What do you think?

819
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,341
Tasty cakes for sure.

820
00:44:28,379 --> 00:44:30,711
l will be fucking her.

821
00:44:31,916 --> 00:44:33,781
What the fuck?
Let's shoot! Come on!

822
00:44:33,818 --> 00:44:35,149
All right, everyone,
back to 1 !

823
00:44:35,186 --> 00:44:36,983
Let's lock it up
and let's roll this puppy!

[chain saw revs]

825
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:42,782
OK, if we could drop
this one and this one,

826
00:44:42,827 --> 00:44:44,294
we might make it before lunch.

827
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:45,056
OK, let's do it.

828
00:44:45,096 --> 00:44:46,154
Um, Natalie!

829
00:44:47,398 --> 00:44:48,456
Hey! What's up?

830
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:50,899
l just wanted to thank you
for what you did before.

831
00:44:50,935 --> 00:44:52,232
lt made a huge difference.

832
00:44:52,269 --> 00:44:53,293
Oh, no problem at all.

833
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:55,464
l don't think we've been
officially introduced.

834

835
00:44:56,707 --> 00:44:58,800
lt's a pleasure to
actually work with someone

836
00:44:58,843 --> 00:45:00,140
who makes my job easier.

837
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:02,543
Most of these assholes
don't know what they're doing.

838
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:03,308
Thanks.

839
00:45:03,347 --> 00:45:05,474
lt's just fascinating watching
a movie come together.

840
00:45:05,516 --> 00:45:07,507
What part of the business
are you interested in?

841
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:09,849
Writing, directing, producing -
all of it!

842
00:45:10,755 --> 00:45:12,017
Should have known.

843
00:45:12,056 --> 00:45:13,318
Well, stick close to the camera.

844
00:45:13,357 --> 00:45:14,654
Maybe l can teach you
a thing or two.

845
00:45:14,692 --> 00:45:16,125
OK, l will.

846
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,422
See you tomorrow?

847
00:45:17,461 --> 00:45:19,622
Sure. Bright and early.

848
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:20,687
Bye.

849
00:45:22,867 --> 00:45:25,392
You know she's total Lesbianese?

850
00:45:28,372 --> 00:45:30,738
So nice to lay in bed with you.

851
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:34,911
At least you don't have to
wake up at the crack of dawn.

852
00:45:34,945 --> 00:45:38,278
Yeah, now l'm gonna be
getting in at the crack of dawn.

853
00:45:38,315 --> 00:45:40,078
We're shootin' nights
this week.

854
00:45:40,117 --> 00:45:41,141
Damn...

855
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,652
Let me take you to breakfast.

856
00:45:42,686 --> 00:45:45,655
Then we can chill in the park
for a few before you go to work?

857
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:49,424
l have an appointment.

858
00:45:50,528 --> 00:45:51,995
What kind of appointment?

859
00:45:52,029 --> 00:45:53,394
With a client.

860
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:55,399
l thought you stopped
doin' all that.

861
00:45:55,966 --> 00:45:59,766
Yeah, for the most part,
but l kept a few regulars.

862
00:45:59,804 --> 00:46:01,032
Why?

863
00:46:01,906 --> 00:46:04,204
You know l'm interning
and l'm not getting paid.

864
00:46:04,241 --> 00:46:05,765
This isn't about the money.

865
00:46:07,511 --> 00:46:09,706
Look, l told you before
it's not all about the money.

866
00:46:09,747 --> 00:46:11,009
l'm gonna stop when l'm ready.

867
00:46:11,048 --> 00:46:12,982
By the time you're ready
l may not be here.

868
00:46:13,017 --> 00:46:14,075
And you know what?

869
00:46:14,118 --> 00:46:16,109
l hate the fact that some
random guy's jerkin' off

870
00:46:16,153 --> 00:46:19,179
to your fucking picture and
it doesn't even bother you!

871
00:46:19,223 --> 00:46:21,851
lt's just a picture.
Why does it bother you?

872
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,689
l'm your fuckin' girl,
that's why.

873
00:46:47,384 --> 00:46:50,046
Ashley!
You can't be here!

874
00:46:50,087 --> 00:46:52,578
Really? Why?
l just wanted to come visit you.

875
00:46:52,623 --> 00:46:54,454
This is not part
of our arrangement.

876
00:46:54,492 --> 00:46:56,824
l've been shopping all day.
l wanna show you what l bought.

877
00:46:56,861 --> 00:46:58,829
Ashley, l have to
get back to work!

878
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:01,092
No, Jim.

879
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:02,292
Walk with me.

880
00:47:07,238 --> 00:47:09,536
l gave you my credit card.
What more do you want?

881
00:47:09,573 --> 00:47:11,040
That's only part of it.

882
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:12,406
l want to know what
you think of what l bought

883
00:47:12,443 --> 00:47:13,876
with your hard-earned money.

884
00:47:13,911 --> 00:47:15,469
But Ashley,
l have a board meeting.

885
00:47:15,513 --> 00:47:16,605
Then you better get started.

886
00:47:16,647 --> 00:47:17,841
Ashley, please don't
do this to me.

887
00:47:17,882 --> 00:47:19,850
This is not cool.
l really gotta go.

888
00:47:19,884 --> 00:47:21,146
Perhaps we should
play the video of

889
00:47:21,185 --> 00:47:23,449
your extra-curricular activities
at your board meeting.

890
00:47:25,422 --> 00:47:26,548
Hey, Jim.

891
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:43,596
Down on one knee.

892
00:47:45,142 --> 00:47:46,439
Down here.

893
00:47:51,015 --> 00:47:52,539
Try those first.

894
00:47:57,121 --> 00:47:59,089
What are you waiting for, Jim?
Put them on.

895
00:48:08,566 --> 00:48:10,693
Let's go, Jim.
l don't have all day.

896
00:48:16,807 --> 00:48:20,208
Ooooh, l like these!

897
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:21,768
What do you think, Jim?

898
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:25,041
They're beautiful.

899
00:48:25,783 --> 00:48:26,841
You know...

900
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:28,545
l think l need
a woman's opinion.

901
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,253
Excuse me.

902
00:48:31,288 --> 00:48:33,051
Do you mind if l ask...

903
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,990
What do you think
of these shoes?

904
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:38,125
l like 'em.
l think they're hot.

905
00:48:38,162 --> 00:48:40,357
l like 'em too.
l just love shoes.

906
00:48:40,397 --> 00:48:42,194
They make me so happy.

907
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,963
l guess you could say
l have a little shoe fetish.

908
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:47,870
Right, Jim?

909
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:51,267
Now take out that next box.

910
00:48:53,510 --> 00:48:55,876
Not that one.
The other one.

911
00:48:57,414 --> 00:48:58,574
Forget that for now.

912
00:48:58,616 --> 00:48:59,810
l've been shopping all day

913
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,681
and l could really use
a foot massage.

914
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:04,948
Why are you doing this to me?

915
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:07,985
Because...

916
00:49:08,025 --> 00:49:09,583
lt's fun.

917
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:12,088
Now get to work.

918
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:29,472
l put something extra in it.

919
00:49:30,014 --> 00:49:31,276
Thank you.

920
00:49:31,315 --> 00:49:33,442
That was better than l expected.

921
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:36,180
l'm glad you enjoyed it.
lt was fun for me, too.

922
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,847
lt felt so real.

923
00:49:37,888 --> 00:49:39,355
You make it so real!

924
00:49:39,390 --> 00:49:41,085
Even my fantasies
aren't this good.

925
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,319
l love you!

926
00:49:44,094 --> 00:49:45,925
Are you in college?

927
00:49:45,963 --> 00:49:46,895
No. Why?

928
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:48,056
What is that?

929
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:49,292
lt's just a script.

930
00:49:49,333 --> 00:49:51,062
Oh, you're a writer?

931
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,329
Yeah.
lt's somethin' l'm working on.

932
00:49:52,369 --> 00:49:54,394
- l'd love to read it.
- Oh, God, no.

933
00:49:54,438 --> 00:49:55,837
Besides, l'm not finished yet.

934
00:49:55,873 --> 00:49:56,771
Come on..

935
00:49:56,807 --> 00:49:58,274
l'd give you my honest opinion.

936
00:50:00,244 --> 00:50:01,370
OK.

937
00:50:01,412 --> 00:50:02,470
l'll send it to you.

938
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:04,278
Thanks.

939
00:50:04,982 --> 00:50:05,949
Enjoy.

940
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:08,509
Taxi!

941
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:25,194
Are you ready to be my slave?

942
00:50:27,237 --> 00:50:29,398
lt's your turn now, Jasmine.

943
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,399
lt's only a a matter of time.

944
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:36,845
Eventually...
everyone becomes my slave.

945
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,905
[evil laughter]

946
00:50:57,634 --> 00:50:59,261
Fuck!

947
00:50:59,303 --> 00:51:01,328
l'm goin' fuckin' crazy.

948
00:51:23,127 --> 00:51:24,321
[knock at door]

949
00:51:24,361 --> 00:51:25,623
Nobody's home!

950
00:51:26,330 --> 00:51:27,490
Hi!

951
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:29,294
l just want to drop these off.

952
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:30,493
Come in, come in.

953
00:51:35,205 --> 00:51:36,900
Sit down...

954
00:51:36,940 --> 00:51:37,964
Relax.

955
00:51:38,709 --> 00:51:40,506
They are taking forever
to light this set,

956
00:51:40,544 --> 00:51:43,672
so we can talk
about your career,

957
00:51:43,714 --> 00:51:46,706
your goals, your dreams...

958
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,913
And what you're doin'
to achieve them.

959
00:51:49,953 --> 00:51:52,478
Well, l want to make movies.

960
00:51:52,523 --> 00:51:54,150
l've been writing this script...

961
00:51:54,191 --> 00:51:56,216
and l want to
produce films as well.

962
00:51:56,260 --> 00:51:57,818
Creative energy excites me.

963
00:51:59,363 --> 00:52:02,332
lt is exciting...sometimes.

964
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:03,560
But if you wanna
be a filmmaker

965
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,999
you just gotta go for it.

966
00:52:05,035 --> 00:52:07,367
Don't let anything
or anyone stop you.

967
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:10,673
And believe me...

968
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:12,470
They will try and stop you!

969
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:13,601
Yeah?

970
00:52:13,644 --> 00:52:16,545
But...l'm sure you've
heard all this before.

971
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,344
Well, yeah,
but l asked you, right?

972
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:21,078
l'm interested
in what you're doing.

973
00:52:21,118 --> 00:52:24,019
You're...smart.

974
00:52:24,054 --> 00:52:26,352
So you're writing a screenplay?

975
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:27,220
Yeah...

976
00:52:27,257 --> 00:52:29,191
Maybe when you get a minute,
you could take a look,

977
00:52:29,226 --> 00:52:30,716
give us some notes?

978
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:32,558
Sure, sure.

979
00:52:32,596 --> 00:52:34,257
What am l here for?

980
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:37,494
When you're finished,
drop off a copy for me.

981
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,532
Well...

982
00:52:51,348 --> 00:52:53,475
l'm impressed.

983
00:52:53,517 --> 00:52:55,417
You're really
on top of your shit.

984
00:52:57,054 --> 00:52:58,578
Well, l'm a fast learner.

985
00:52:58,622 --> 00:52:59,486
Trust me -

986
00:52:59,523 --> 00:53:01,286
When l put my mind
to something...

987
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:03,156
l usually get what l want.

988
00:53:03,193 --> 00:53:09,154
You know...l think that
you will have no trouble

989
00:53:09,199 --> 00:53:11,997
working your way up
in this business.

990
00:53:12,035 --> 00:53:15,198
ln fact, l might be able
to help you.

991
00:53:16,406 --> 00:53:19,034
Maybe we can help each other,
if you know what l mean.

992
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:22,644
l think l do.

993
00:53:26,183 --> 00:53:28,083
ls that what you want, Michael?

994
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:31,954
Actually, yes.
That is what l want.

995
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,260
Well, l gotta warn you.

996
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:42,425
l'm a real...naughty girl.

997
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:46,057
Yeah...

998
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:48,837
l like naughty girls.

999
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,432
l bet you do.

1000
00:53:53,777 --> 00:53:55,438
So...

1001
00:53:55,479 --> 00:53:57,640
Have you ever been tied up?

1002
00:53:57,681 --> 00:54:01,208
No, but l've tied
a bunch of girls up.

1003
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:05,888
l love being in control.
lt makes me hot.

1004
00:54:05,923 --> 00:54:07,390
Yeah?

1005
00:54:07,424 --> 00:54:09,324
Whatever turns you on, sweetie.

1006
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,496
This is getting me
so fucking excited.

1007
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:18,592
Yeah?

1008
00:54:18,635 --> 00:54:20,296
Are your panties getting wet?

1009
00:54:30,213 --> 00:54:31,475
Fuck!

1010
00:54:31,515 --> 00:54:33,449
You are good.

1011
00:54:35,319 --> 00:54:38,720
l really can't
move here, sweetie.

1012
00:54:38,755 --> 00:54:40,222
Good.

1013
00:54:40,257 --> 00:54:43,749
l want you completely helpless.

1014
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:46,419
l wanna fuck
the shit out of you.

1015
00:54:46,463 --> 00:54:49,261
And l want you
to shut the fuck up.

1016
00:54:50,901 --> 00:54:53,529
l have a special surprise
for you.

1017
00:54:54,771 --> 00:54:57,205
l want you to feel
as hot as l do.

1018
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:02,211
Do you want to fuck me, Michael?

1019
00:55:02,245 --> 00:55:03,906
Uh huh...

1020
00:55:03,947 --> 00:55:05,141
You wish.

1021
00:55:06,149 --> 00:55:07,844
You see...

1022
00:55:07,884 --> 00:55:10,682
You've been a bad boy.

1023
00:55:10,721 --> 00:55:13,622
And bad boys have to
be punished, Michael.

1024
00:55:14,424 --> 00:55:16,449
And l want you to know...

1025
00:55:18,629 --> 00:55:20,290
what you have coming to you.

1026
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:23,365
First l'm gonna start
with your balls,

1027
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:26,892
and l'm gonna
tie 'em up real tight.

1028
00:55:26,937 --> 00:55:28,871
And then l'm gonna
whip your ass

1029
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,169
until you're crying
like a little bitch!

1030
00:55:32,442 --> 00:55:34,842
Then l'm gonna
spit in your face,

1031
00:55:34,878 --> 00:55:37,972
and pee right in your mouth.

1032
00:55:39,182 --> 00:55:41,013
That's right, Michael.

1033
00:55:41,051 --> 00:55:42,746
l'm gonna make you drink me.

1034
00:55:43,987 --> 00:55:45,579
l'm gonna show you

1035
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:50,286
what a real bad girl
does to a bad boy!

1036
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:59,194
l don't think
you're ready for this.

1037
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,607
Hey, Michael, Miley said--

1038
00:56:12,816 --> 00:56:14,443
What the fuck are you doin'?

1039
00:56:18,121 --> 00:56:20,715
Can we get some scissors
for him in here, please?

1040
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:26,319
Fuck!

1041
00:56:27,364 --> 00:56:28,922
Tell that fuckin', crazy bitch

1042
00:56:28,965 --> 00:56:31,160
that she is never allowed
on my set again!

1043
00:56:36,106 --> 00:56:38,540
Come on, sleepy head,
Get up!

1044
00:56:38,575 --> 00:56:40,065
Stop.

1045
00:56:40,110 --> 00:56:42,704
l'm sleeping
and l have a hangover.

1046
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:43,508
See?

1047
00:56:43,547 --> 00:56:45,481
You were totally
the designated drunk last night.

1048
00:56:45,515 --> 00:56:47,415
l told you
to slow your ass down.

1049
00:56:47,451 --> 00:56:49,783
Wake up.
You gotta get up for work.

1050
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:54,486
l got downsized.

1051
00:56:54,524 --> 00:56:55,650
We can cuddle all day.

1052
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:58,060
Downsized?

1053
00:56:58,095 --> 00:57:00,791
How does an intern
get downsized?

1054
00:57:01,865 --> 00:57:02,957
What happened?

1055
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,727
All right...

1056
00:57:05,769 --> 00:57:07,236
l got fired.

1057
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:09,431
Fired?

1058
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,498
For what?

1059
00:57:11,541 --> 00:57:13,031
What did you do?

1060
00:57:14,511 --> 00:57:15,876
What did l do?

1061
00:57:15,912 --> 00:57:18,073
Why do you immediately
think it was my fault?

1062
00:57:24,421 --> 00:57:25,979
Look...
lt's complicated, OK?

1063
00:57:26,022 --> 00:57:28,388
Me and the director, who is
a complete fucking asshole,

1064
00:57:28,425 --> 00:57:29,915
had a big misunderstanding.

1065
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:31,587
l'm not surprised...

1066
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:34,362
You stomp around like you're
the Queen of the City

1067
00:57:34,397 --> 00:57:37,025
and whatever you say goes
and that's that!

1068
00:57:40,103 --> 00:57:41,627
ls that how you see me?

1069
00:57:41,671 --> 00:57:43,605
Yeah...

1070
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,870
Well, sometimes.

1071
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:47,536
lt's just your energy.

1072
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:50,706
Jazzy, you're not
makin' any sense.

1073
00:57:50,747 --> 00:57:54,649
l thought this was gonna work
when you got that new job.

1074
00:57:56,486 --> 00:57:57,714
Obviously it's not.

1075
00:57:57,754 --> 00:58:00,279
You'll probably just go back and
do that same shit again, right?

1076
00:58:00,323 --> 00:58:02,723
But l never stopped.

1077
00:58:02,759 --> 00:58:05,523
What l do has no reflection
on how l feel about you.

1078
00:58:05,562 --> 00:58:07,860
l have to share you with all
these perverts and freaks

1079
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:10,128
looking at you,
droolin' all over you.

1080
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:13,000
lt's bad enough the shit
we gotta go through day to day

1081
00:58:13,036 --> 00:58:16,096
as lesbians in this city,
and you invite that shit.

1082
00:58:17,307 --> 00:58:19,935
You don't have to
share me with anybody!

1083
00:58:21,044 --> 00:58:23,535
And the crazy thing is
you like that shit!

1084
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:26,540
l see how much you love it.

1085
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:30,314
l see how much your eyes
light up when you talk about it.

1086
00:58:30,353 --> 00:58:32,184
You try and find a girl
who's gonna love you

1087
00:58:32,222 --> 00:58:34,087
and deal with this shit.

1088
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:37,093
l'm sorry...
lt's givin' me nightmares.

1089
00:58:38,695 --> 00:58:40,253
What do you want me to do?

1090
00:58:40,997 --> 00:58:43,158
lt doesn't even matter.

1091
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,634
lt's who you are...

1092
00:58:45,669 --> 00:58:47,637
lt's what you are.

1093
00:58:47,671 --> 00:58:50,731
Sorry, l'm scared of all
this dominatrix shit.

1094
00:58:50,774 --> 00:58:52,401
l don't wanna
get caught up in it.

1095
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:58,047
l don't know what to say.

1096
00:59:20,237 --> 00:59:21,636
- Hey.
- Hey.

1097
00:59:22,405 --> 00:59:23,770
Hey!

1098
00:59:24,674 --> 00:59:25,868
Hey what?

1099
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:27,467
Are you all right?

1100
00:59:27,510 --> 00:59:29,068
Yeah, l'm fine.

1101
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:30,670
OK...

1102
00:59:30,714 --> 00:59:31,942
Well, um...

1103
00:59:31,982 --> 00:59:33,142
l was on the subway

1104
00:59:33,183 --> 00:59:34,741
and there was this
really hot guy--

1105
00:59:34,784 --> 00:59:36,445
Jazz and l
got into another fight.

1106
00:59:37,621 --> 00:59:38,781
l'm sorry.

1107
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:40,483
What was that about
the subway guy?

1108
00:59:40,523 --> 00:59:41,990
Oh, nothing.

1109
00:59:42,025 --> 00:59:43,219
Your girlfriend troubles

1110
00:59:43,260 --> 00:59:45,820
trump my almost getting
picked up by a blue-eyed hottie.

1111
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:48,092
lt just keeps happening.
lt's crazy.

1112
00:59:48,131 --> 00:59:50,292
Well, are you doing
anything different?

1113
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:51,994
What do you mean?

1114
00:59:52,602 --> 00:59:56,971
Well, some people might think
that the definition of crazy

1115
00:59:57,007 --> 00:59:59,339
is doing the same thing
over and over again

1116
00:59:59,376 --> 01:00:01,344
and expecting different results.

1117
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:03,972
What?

1118
01:00:04,447 --> 01:00:06,381
Didn't Mommy say that?

1119
01:00:06,416 --> 01:00:08,008
Oh, shit.

1120
01:00:09,386 --> 01:00:11,411
Oh, fuck, l'm quoting Mommy?

1121
01:00:12,589 --> 01:00:14,989
Am l becoming Mommy?

1122
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:16,515
Yeah...

1123
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,459
The transformation has begun.

1124
01:00:20,697 --> 01:00:22,130
My life is over.

1125
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:25,962
Oh, God...

1126
01:00:53,330 --> 01:00:55,423
Holy shit.

1127
01:01:15,685 --> 01:01:16,879
Hey, sis.

1128
01:01:18,388 --> 01:01:20,015
Are you all right?

1129
01:01:21,558 --> 01:01:23,025
Yeah, l'm fine.

1130
01:01:25,328 --> 01:01:27,057
Mommy says you're depressed.

1131
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:29,923
Ma!

1132
01:01:29,966 --> 01:01:32,127
Why are you telling
everyone l'm depressed?

1133
01:01:32,168 --> 01:01:34,227
Rebecca's not everyone.

1134
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,101
And you're all emotional.

1135
01:01:36,139 --> 01:01:37,606
Emotional?

1136
01:01:37,640 --> 01:01:39,699
Me and my girlfriend
just broke up.

1137
01:01:39,743 --> 01:01:41,370
Of course l'm emotional.

1138
01:01:41,411 --> 01:01:44,175
Don't you think you're
being overly sensitive?

1139
01:01:44,214 --> 01:01:46,944
No, l think you're being
a little insensitive.

1140
01:01:46,983 --> 01:01:49,747
lt's just because
we care about you.

1141
01:01:49,786 --> 01:01:52,653
The right person
will love you for who you are.

1142
01:01:53,456 --> 01:01:54,616
l know.

1143
01:01:57,327 --> 01:01:59,124
She wasn't right for you anyway.

1144
01:01:59,929 --> 01:02:01,294
How do you know?

1145
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:03,959
She was just a little
too normal for you.

1146
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,524
l liked her for me.

1147
01:02:08,571 --> 01:02:11,233
Natalie, your hair
looks really pretty.

1148
01:02:11,274 --> 01:02:13,469
Why don't you
leave it down today?

1149
01:02:14,244 --> 01:02:15,768
Enough with the hair thing, Ma.

1150
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:17,279
ls there some fetish
we should know about?

1151
01:02:17,313 --> 01:02:19,304
What's your fascination
with our hair?

1152
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:25,113
[all laughing]

1153
01:02:27,190 --> 01:02:29,420
No, no, no.

1154
01:02:29,459 --> 01:02:32,917
l just want you guys
to be healthy and happy.

1155
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:36,465
l am happy...

1156
01:02:36,499 --> 01:02:38,057
l'm just tryin' to find myself.

1157
01:02:38,101 --> 01:02:39,363
You'll find yourself.

1158
01:02:39,402 --> 01:02:41,461
The important thing
to use your passion

1159
01:02:41,504 --> 01:02:44,098
to define your place
in this world.

1160
01:02:59,255 --> 01:03:00,984
[knocking at door]

1161
01:03:05,261 --> 01:03:06,990
- Hey, Noah.
- Are you all right?

1162
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:08,588
How did you know?

1163
01:03:08,631 --> 01:03:10,496
Melanie told me.

1164
01:03:10,533 --> 01:03:13,229
lt's just stupid.
Everything's so stupid.

1165
01:03:13,269 --> 01:03:14,361
l know.

1166
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:16,668
lt's gonna be all right.
l got you.

1167
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:17,673
You're gonna bounce back.

1168
01:03:17,707 --> 01:03:19,072
You're the motherfuckin'
queen bee,

1169
01:03:19,109 --> 01:03:20,804
the bad girl extraordinaire!
C'mon now.

1170
01:03:21,678 --> 01:03:23,168
Bad girl...

1171
01:03:23,213 --> 01:03:26,410
The job, the relationship,
the director.

1172
01:03:26,449 --> 01:03:27,882
Bad, bad, bad.

1173
01:03:27,917 --> 01:03:29,043
You're right...

1174
01:03:29,085 --> 01:03:31,053
l am the
bad girl extraordinaire,

1175
01:03:31,087 --> 01:03:32,213
but not in a good way.

1176
01:03:32,255 --> 01:03:33,813
Come here...

1177
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:35,449
ln times like these,

1178
01:03:35,492 --> 01:03:38,154
there's only two things
you can turn to -

1179
01:03:38,194 --> 01:03:39,752
Friends...

1180
01:03:39,796 --> 01:03:42,993
And of course...
da ganja, mon.

1181
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:44,329
Come on.

1182
01:03:46,102 --> 01:03:48,502
l'm so upset right now
l don't even wanna smoke.

1183
01:03:48,538 --> 01:03:50,597
Come on, girl!
Get the fuck outta here!

1184
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:51,800
Last week we were like

1185
01:03:51,841 --> 01:03:53,001
Cheech and Chong
in this muthafucker!

1186
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:54,168
l can't even focus.

1187
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:55,837
You got a bad case
of girl drama,

1188
01:03:55,879 --> 01:03:57,540
which means you're
gonna forget about

1189
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,548
this shit in a week.
Now come on.

1190
01:04:05,388 --> 01:04:06,480
All right.

1191
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,151
Here we go...

1192
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:22,229
l gave him a copy of the script.

1193
01:04:22,272 --> 01:04:23,899
You did?

1194
01:04:25,708 --> 01:04:28,074
Can't have our shit
out there all unfinished...

1195
01:04:30,313 --> 01:04:31,940
l'll get our shit back.

1196
01:04:31,981 --> 01:04:34,711
Even if l have to beat his ass,
l will get our shit back.

1197
01:04:34,751 --> 01:04:37,447
You gonna get all
gansta on his ass?

1198
01:04:37,487 --> 01:04:39,045
l will haunt that motherfucker

1199
01:04:39,088 --> 01:04:40,749
like the soul
of a child molester.

1200
01:04:41,724 --> 01:04:43,749
[phone rings]

1201
01:04:43,793 --> 01:04:45,454
That's probably my grandmother.

1202
01:04:46,196 --> 01:04:47,322
Natalie!

1203
01:04:47,363 --> 01:04:49,490
lt's me, Michael.

1204
01:04:49,532 --> 01:04:51,124
Hey...

Holy shit!

Damn, you got him

Tell me what happened.

1216
01:05:16,893 --> 01:05:20,021
Well, your boy was
gettin' all nasty with me,

1217
01:05:20,063 --> 01:05:21,792
and l had to show him
what nasty really is.

1218
01:05:21,831 --> 01:05:23,025

Damn, ma.

How the fuck
did he get my number?

1226
01:05:41,551 --> 01:05:42,916
Let's get to work.

1227

the last time we all hung out

1231
01:06:10,246 --> 01:06:11,577
since l left the dungeon.

1232
01:06:11,614 --> 01:06:13,013
- Do you?
- Nope.

1233

For real!

l never thought l'd hear that
out of your mouth.

01:06:43,546 --> 01:06:45,275
Well, there comes
a point in life

1246
01:06:45,315 --> 01:06:48,250
where you must grow up
and leave certain things behind.

1247
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,617

l mean, l think he's really
kind of into it.

1254
01:07:05,001 --> 01:07:07,196
l've been having
an amazing time.

1255
01:07:08,504 --> 01:07:10,165
What about you, Nat?

1256
01:07:10,206 --> 01:07:12,003
l kept a couple of regulars.

1257
01:07:12,041 --> 01:07:14,202
But me and Noah are busy
with our script.

1258
01:07:14,243 --> 01:07:16,871
Oh, and how is that going?

1259
01:07:16,913 --> 01:07:19,882
The film business is rough,
but l love it!

1260
01:07:20,983 --> 01:07:23,508
Do you all wanna
get some ices?

1261
01:07:23,553 --> 01:07:25,180
- Yes!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!

1262
01:07:26,589 --> 01:07:28,113
l wanna go first!

1263
01:07:39,001 --> 01:07:41,026
What are you doing
with your script?

1264
01:07:41,070 --> 01:07:42,731
l'm not sure what
the next step is,

1265
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:44,296
except getting it produced.

1266
01:07:44,340 --> 01:07:46,399
l have to find someone
who believes in it...

1267
01:07:46,442 --> 01:07:48,171
and believes in me.

1268
01:07:48,211 --> 01:07:50,042
Well, l believe in you.

1269
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:52,411
l care about you
and l want to help you.

1270
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:54,075
That's sweet.

1271
01:07:55,218 --> 01:07:56,776
Thank you.

1272
01:07:56,819 --> 01:07:58,616
No, l'm serious.

1273
01:07:58,654 --> 01:08:01,714
l'm a good businessman
and l know people.

1274
01:08:01,758 --> 01:08:04,158
But l don't know
anything about film.

1275
01:08:04,193 --> 01:08:06,593
lf you can find
a hotshot director...

1276
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:08,324
l'll back it.

1277
01:08:08,364 --> 01:08:10,389
Just leave all the finances
up to me.

1278
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:12,466
Really?

1279
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:14,561
You'd do that for me?

1280
01:08:14,604 --> 01:08:16,538
l'd do anything
for you, Mistress.

1281
01:08:22,745 --> 01:08:24,235
Psst...

1282
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:25,804
My real name's Natalie.

1283
01:08:45,034 --> 01:08:46,331
Natalie!

1284
01:08:46,369 --> 01:08:48,667
Hey, um...
We need to talk.

1285
01:08:48,704 --> 01:08:50,069
Michael, what the fuck
are you doing here?

1286
01:08:50,106 --> 01:08:51,266
Are you stalking me?

1287
01:08:51,307 --> 01:08:53,867
No! l-l just...

1288
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:55,673
l needed to see you.

1289
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,814
What do you want, Michael?

1290
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,373
You did something to me.

1291
01:09:01,417 --> 01:09:05,410
You unlocked something in me
l didn't know existed.

1292
01:09:05,455 --> 01:09:07,582
Something l can't control.

1293
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:09,955
You know me...
l gotta control everything.

1294
01:09:09,992 --> 01:09:11,653
Yeah, you're an asshole.

1295
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:14,662
lf we could just...

1296
01:09:14,697 --> 01:09:16,995
lf l could just
spend some time with you...

1297
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:19,691
Maybe we can work something out?

1298
01:09:21,504 --> 01:09:22,732
Sure...

1299
01:09:22,772 --> 01:09:24,399
We can work somethin' out.

1300
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,805
Step into my office.

1301
01:09:33,382 --> 01:09:34,781
Somebody will be here shortly

1302
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:36,682
to prepare you
for your Mistress.

1303
01:10:38,748 --> 01:10:40,215
Hi.

1304
01:10:44,820 --> 01:10:46,447
l've been thinking about
what you said about me

1305
01:10:46,489 --> 01:10:48,047
not being ready...

1306
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:49,955
And you were right.

1307
01:10:49,992 --> 01:10:51,289
But l'm ready now.

1308
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:54,729
Oh, really?

1309
01:10:56,766 --> 01:10:58,324
Ready for what?

1310
01:10:58,367 --> 01:11:00,335
Ready to do whatever l...

1311
01:11:03,873 --> 01:11:06,341
Ready to do whatever
you want me to do.

1312
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:09,873
OK.

1313
01:11:09,912 --> 01:11:12,574
The first thing
l want you to do...

1314
01:11:46,849 --> 01:11:50,512
My Normal, by Natalie Lawna
and Noah Cohen.

1315
01:11:50,553 --> 01:11:51,884
Scene One.

1316
01:11:51,921 --> 01:11:54,185
James, a middle-aged man
dressed in a suit

1317
01:11:54,223 --> 01:11:56,418
sits behind a desk
shuffling papers.

1318
01:11:56,459 --> 01:11:58,324
He shakes his head
and mutters...

1319
01:12:01,897 --> 01:12:04,092
We have a very
big problem here, girls.

1320
01:12:05,067 --> 01:12:09,128
Girls, we have
a very big problem.

1321
01:12:09,171 --> 01:12:12,732
We have a very
big problem, girls.

1322
01:12:12,775 --> 01:12:15,403
Girls, we have
a very big problem.

1323
01:12:16,846 --> 01:12:18,507
How big is our problem?

1324
01:12:19,849 --> 01:12:22,477
[dialogue continues
and fades]

1325
01:13:16,505 --> 01:13:17,802
Ashtray.

1326
01:13:45,401 --> 01:13:46,868
What have l done?

1327
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:47,766
Marker.

1328
01:13:48,437 --> 01:13:50,132
You don't even know!

1329
01:13:54,677 --> 01:13:55,803
Hi.

1330
01:14:15,631 --> 01:14:18,395
Tell us a little bit
about your character.

1331
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:23,599
My character is,
l guess, the gimp...

1332
01:14:23,639 --> 01:14:26,369
the ashtray.

1333
01:14:26,408 --> 01:14:29,002
He's the bitch of
the main character

1334
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:33,105
and he's only there as
a receptacle for her garbage.

1335
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:53,425
Can you tell me your name
and what you do?

1336
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:55,999
My name is Storm,

1337
01:14:56,038 --> 01:14:57,767
and l'm a physical therapist.
