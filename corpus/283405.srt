1
00:00:18,444 --> 00:00:20,207
Are we still partners?

2
00:00:22,248 --> 00:00:24,580
We've been business partners
for nearly three years.

3
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:27,512
This is the first time
we've ever sat together.

4
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:30,214
We hardly ever see each other.

5
00:00:31,057 --> 00:00:33,525
l know how hard it is for a man
to control his passion.

6
00:00:33,893 --> 00:00:36,384
Partners shouldn't get emotionally
involved with each other.

7
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,141
Fallen Angels

8
00:04:16,182 --> 00:04:17,046
Paging 3662.

9
00:04:17,083 --> 00:04:18,516
l'd like to leave a message.

10
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:19,984
l'll meet his friends tomorrow.

11
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:22,381
Where and when?

12
00:04:40,373 --> 00:04:42,898
Most people work from 9 to 5.

13
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,502
l'm the opposite.

14
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,813
My job is simple.

15
00:04:48,848 --> 00:04:52,113
l visit friends now and again.

16
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:55,579
l don't know any ofthese people.

17
00:04:55,788 --> 00:04:58,018
They don't interest me, either.

18
00:04:58,491 --> 00:05:00,459
Soon, they'll be history.

19
00:06:45,631 --> 00:06:48,031
- Going out?
- Yes.

20
00:06:52,838 --> 00:06:56,001
One's profession is very often
determined by one's personality.

21
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:59,267
l love my job...
no decision making.

22
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,647
Like who's to die, where and
when - is all planned by others.

23
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:10,746
l'm a lazy person. l like others
to arrange things for me.

24
00:07:11,123 --> 00:07:12,613
That's why l need a partner.

25
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,274
Ming?

26
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:55,784
Ming

27
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,990
lt is Ming, isn't it?

28
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:01,557
Remember me? l'm Hoi.

29
00:10:01,894 --> 00:10:06,388
Remember? We were in the same
class at junior high

30
00:10:06,699 --> 00:10:07,427
Yes...

31
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,997
What a coincidence

32
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:12,128
lf my Merc hadn't broken down.
we wouldn't have met

33
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:14,571
Everyone has a past.

34
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:18,674
Even an assassin once had
classmates at junior high.

35
00:10:19,445 --> 00:10:21,310
Whenever l bump into old pals...

36
00:10:21,614 --> 00:10:24,481
...they always ask the
same old questions.

37
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:27,641
What do you do for a living?

38
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:31,113
Got a card?
We must keep in touch

39
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:34,325
Let's arrange something.
What d'you think?

40
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:37,187
As long as there's money
to make...

41
00:10:38,998 --> 00:10:42,126
You run your own business?

42
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,163
Are you married?

43
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,303
Don't tell me you're still single?

44
00:10:47,673 --> 00:10:52,201
Hey A son
He looks exactly like you

45
00:10:52,545 --> 00:10:56,037
You're telling me... Your
wife's a nigger, eh?

46
00:10:56,348 --> 00:10:59,442
You're very liberal.
Blacks... They're beautiful.

47
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:04,189
Colour doesn't matter, does it?
You really look like a couple.

48
00:11:04,523 --> 00:11:06,718
Say, are you insured?

49
00:11:07,026 --> 00:11:11,554
Think about it. l'm a pro.
insurance is my business.

50
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,027
You know, l've been crowned
'King ofthe Brokers...

51
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,591
...in Southeast Asia.

52
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:20,600
TlME are doing an interview
with me in the next few days.

53
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:23,307
Look, for old time's sake...

54
00:11:23,576 --> 00:11:26,409
...l'll work out a decent plan for you.

55
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:29,944
You may not want to hear this...

56
00:11:30,249 --> 00:11:34,345
...but accidents happen, your
family needs protection.

57
00:11:34,587 --> 00:11:36,248
Your job involves travel.

58
00:11:36,288 --> 00:11:38,722
You must think ofyour
family unit.

59
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:41,050
Would an insurance company...

60
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:43,557
...underwrite a professional
killer, l wonder?

61
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:48,096
l'd love to take up his offer...
but who do l name as beneficiary?

62
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,029
Remember the big bosom?
The one we both fancied?

63
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:55,165
We're getting married next week.
Here's an invitation card.

64
00:11:55,207 --> 00:11:59,268
Just fill in you name, okay?

65
00:11:59,712 --> 00:12:03,011
Please come, and l'll have
the insurance ready for you.

66
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:05,676
Bring your wife along, too.
See you

67
00:12:06,251 --> 00:12:10,381
Ages ago l paid a black woman
$30 to pose with me for a photo.

68
00:12:10,723 --> 00:12:13,954
Whenever people asked
l'd say she's my wife.

69
00:12:14,326 --> 00:12:18,319
And the kid in the picture? l think
l bought him an ice cream.

70
00:12:18,764 --> 00:12:21,858
l always wanted to go
to a wedding reception.

71
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:26,094
But l know it's not my scene.

72
00:14:23,021 --> 00:14:24,886
Sifting through a man's rubbish...

73
00:14:25,257 --> 00:14:28,522
...one can easily find clues
as to his background.

74
00:14:29,595 --> 00:14:32,291
He visits this bar a lot.

75
00:14:35,534 --> 00:14:36,967
Likes the laid-back atmosphere.

76
00:14:37,402 --> 00:14:41,429
l always sit at the same table
he sat at.

77
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:45,170
Makes me feel sort of
closer to him.

78
00:14:48,914 --> 00:14:54,614
There are some people you
can never get close to.

79
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:00,324
Get too close,
and you'll find him boring.

80
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:05,364
l'm someone
who plays by the rules.

81
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:10,529
l know how to be easygoing.

82
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:48,039
No, he hasn't come home.

83
00:19:48,346 --> 00:19:52,214
- You're telling the truth?
- Why should l lie?

84
00:19:53,552 --> 00:19:56,316
You live here?

85
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:58,216
Of course.

86
00:19:58,457 --> 00:20:00,721
- Ever seen this person?
- No.

87
00:20:13,505 --> 00:20:17,100
Keep out of sight.
The cops are still outside.

88
00:20:31,156 --> 00:20:32,248
Where is your son?

89
00:20:32,724 --> 00:20:35,215
We rub shoulders with people
every day.

90
00:20:35,927 --> 00:20:39,829
Strangers who may even become
friends or confidants.

91
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:45,029
One thing l do know-these cops
will never be my friends.

92
00:20:45,937 --> 00:20:49,771
My name's He Qiwu.
My prison number was 223.

93
00:20:50,742 --> 00:20:54,075
l haven't seen him for days.
l'll inform you when he returns.

94
00:20:54,446 --> 00:20:57,074
l saw him come in.
l want the truth

95
00:21:01,786 --> 00:21:03,515
That's enough Keep still

96
00:21:23,308 --> 00:21:25,139
l'm a very happy man.

97
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:27,774
l was very talkative
when l was small.

98
00:21:28,113 --> 00:21:32,174
But since eating an out of date can
of pineapple when l was five...

99
00:21:32,484 --> 00:21:34,679
...l lost my voice.

100
00:21:35,587 --> 00:21:38,385
For this reason.
l have very few friends.

101
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,716
l also found it diffiicult
to find a job.

102
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:45,551
So l finally decided
to be my own boss.

103
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:06,174
Having no capital,
my only option...

104
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:10,684
...was to enter shops after hours
and run my business that way.

105
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:14,982
l don't mean to take advantage,
but it's practical...

106
00:22:15,694 --> 00:22:18,720
to run an all-night business.

107
00:22:19,297 --> 00:22:25,964
Customers do come in at 3 a.m.
to buy meat. Business is business.

108
00:22:26,004 --> 00:22:28,837
Always satisfy the needs
ofyour customer.

109
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:32,804
As the old saying goes:
'The customer is always right'.

110
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:36,976
And as the boss, l must be
kind, caring and tolerant.

111
00:22:37,015 --> 00:22:39,279
One can't afford to be selfish...

112
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:42,514
...there's no such thing as a
free lunch in this world.

113
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:46,183
l always work very hard at night
- well, until very late.

114
00:22:46,524 --> 00:22:50,187
l don't make a fortune,
but l'm happy.

115
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:10,975
Are you crazy? Why are you
making me wash my clothes?

116
00:23:11,016 --> 00:23:14,508
l'm a beggar The last thing
l need is a laundry

117
00:23:14,552 --> 00:23:16,315
Leave me alone...

118
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:21,815
You are crazy
Get your hands off my clothes

119
00:23:22,093 --> 00:23:26,553
Sod off
l'll smash you to pulp

120
00:23:26,865 --> 00:23:30,631
Okay, l'll pay you...
if it's money you want

121
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,294
Cretin

122
00:23:34,706 --> 00:23:37,698
Leave it
l don't want an aubergine

123
00:23:37,976 --> 00:23:41,503
No, l don't want them
l must act like a lady.

124
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:44,943
l don't accept freebies from
strangers. People will talk

125
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:47,411
l'll have a melon, okay?

126
00:23:49,587 --> 00:23:50,417
Here

127
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:59,625
What the hell
You crazy or something?

128
00:24:00,198 --> 00:24:01,859
Stop that

129
00:24:04,002 --> 00:24:08,336
Listen, l washed
my hair yesterday...

130
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:16,270
Ouch Take it easy...

131
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:18,980
Don't scratch

132
00:24:22,354 --> 00:24:24,914
l just want a late snack.

133
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:27,057
l don't need a shampoo

134
00:24:30,995 --> 00:24:33,793
Okay, you win.
Do what you like

135
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:39,994
No

136
00:24:40,972 --> 00:24:43,805
l don't want a shave

137
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:52,310
Don't touch me...

138
00:24:57,155 --> 00:24:59,817
Listen, l know l'm diffiicult,
but l know some...

139
00:25:00,992 --> 00:25:02,050
...who aren't

140
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:08,892
Please don't shave me...
l don't want a shave...

141
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:11,431
l'll pay you not to, okay?

142
00:25:12,804 --> 00:25:14,101
Thanks.

143
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:17,368
A double cone, please.

144
00:25:19,444 --> 00:25:20,934
Fuck lt's you

145
00:25:21,246 --> 00:25:23,771
l'm sorry... sorry...

146
00:25:32,724 --> 00:25:35,887
Stop pulling my hair, okay?

147
00:25:35,927 --> 00:25:38,487
l'll serve myself.

148
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:47,532
l'll do it.

149
00:25:54,879 --> 00:25:58,610
Hi, it's me.
What are you doing?

150
00:26:00,919 --> 00:26:02,944
Go to bed, don't wait up.

151
00:26:05,557 --> 00:26:08,219
l'm having some ice-cream.

152
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:12,724
l hope l can come home soon.

153
00:26:13,164 --> 00:26:16,691
l don't know how much more
l'll have to eat.

154
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:19,929
Of course l'll have to pay

155
00:26:25,043 --> 00:26:28,240
Look, l've run into this guy, and...

156
00:26:28,813 --> 00:26:31,281
What's to explain?
lt's the truth

157
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:35,912
Come down and see for yourself.

158
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:37,984
Hey

159
00:26:42,427 --> 00:26:46,261
Oh, no way
l can't eat that

160
00:26:48,733 --> 00:26:50,598
lt'll burn my moustache.

161
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:54,133
This is beyond a joke...

162
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,636
What the hell's going on?

163
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,941
l said come by yourself. l didn't
say bring dad and the kids

164
00:27:06,384 --> 00:27:09,353
Too much ice cream's
bad for dad.

165
00:27:09,587 --> 00:27:11,953
What if something happens?

166
00:27:12,991 --> 00:27:15,755
And the kids have school tomorrow.

167
00:27:16,094 --> 00:27:17,994
What's that...?

168
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:28,764
l don't want to die
from eating too much ice cream.

169
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:31,238
Look, l'm being serious.

170
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,910
l'll pay you, okay?

171
00:27:35,213 --> 00:27:39,377
Tell me how much, and l'll
buy all the ice cream. Go on.

172
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,888
My ice cream maybe a
bit more expensive...

173
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:48,550
...but l think this family's
having a great time tonight.

174
00:27:49,994 --> 00:27:53,862
l love ice cream.
When l was a kid...

175
00:27:53,898 --> 00:27:56,890
...an ice cream van always
stopped outside our place.

176
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,096
Every time l saw it.
l was happy.

177
00:28:00,071 --> 00:28:04,371
l even asked my dad why he
didn't drive an ice cream van.

178
00:28:04,976 --> 00:28:08,104
He didn't answer me.
l later found out...

179
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:11,710
...that my mum was killed
by an ice cream van.

180
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,783
l was born in Taiwan...

181
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:19,017
...and came to Hong Kong
with dad when l was five.

182
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:21,855
He worked as an assistant
in Chungking Mansions.

183
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:26,426
After my mum's death.
he very rarely talked.

184
00:28:26,464 --> 00:28:28,659
And we never ate ice cream.

185
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,168
The fact that we're both
quiet and subtle...

186
00:28:33,204 --> 00:28:35,798
...probably explains the
close bond between us.

187
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,079
What are you thinking of?

188
00:28:43,781 --> 00:28:46,113
And why the ice cream?

189
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:05,859
You know l don't like ice cream.
lt's too cold...

190
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,864
...and it gives me the runs.

191
00:29:22,286 --> 00:29:23,617
You're crazy

192
00:29:38,503 --> 00:29:42,303
Let me out
What are you playing at?

193
00:29:45,343 --> 00:29:49,245
What are you doing?
l'll kill you

194
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,105
Open this door
You hear?

195
00:30:06,364 --> 00:30:08,355
Paging 9090.

196
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,394
l'd like to leave a message.

197
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:14,229
l'll meet his frinds tomorrow.

198
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:17,635
Let me know where and when.

199
00:32:00,511 --> 00:32:03,708
lt's crystal clear...crystal clear...

200
00:32:04,816 --> 00:32:09,048
l just want to check
that l've got the right place.

201
00:32:09,287 --> 00:32:12,313
lt's a fast-food store,
not a barber shop.

202
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:16,288
You may think that we're
making a lot of money.

203
00:32:17,261 --> 00:32:19,957
What price a human life?

204
00:32:20,231 --> 00:32:21,630
Depends on your luck.

205
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,425
Business can be slack for ages.

206
00:32:23,701 --> 00:32:25,760
So, to make a living...

207
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:28,028
...l'll occasionally invest
in other businesses.

208
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,438
Like debt collection.

209
00:32:30,474 --> 00:32:31,566
Thanks.

210
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:36,639
Hold on. l'll get your money.

211
00:32:42,386 --> 00:32:43,080
Here.

212
00:34:21,552 --> 00:34:23,816
But lately. l've suffered
quite a few injuries.

213
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:27,917
l hate digging bullets
out of my own body.

214
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,894
lt's very exhausting.

215
00:34:33,864 --> 00:34:35,525
l went to bed early that night.

216
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:39,761
When l awoke next morning,
l came to a decision.

217
00:34:54,452 --> 00:34:56,579
Lady, we're closed.

218
00:34:57,521 --> 00:35:00,149
Two weeks after l was
injured, l asked her out.

219
00:35:01,125 --> 00:35:02,820
l wanted to tell her my decision.

220
00:35:04,128 --> 00:35:07,894
But... l didn't show up.

221
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:35,182
l'm sure she'll come looking
for me in a couple of days.

222
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,257
After all, we've been partners
for a long time.

223
00:35:47,371 --> 00:35:51,603
Being partners, you get to
understand each other.

224
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:53,742
Almost able to read
each other's minds.

225
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:55,746
l'd often leave her some clues...

226
00:35:57,481 --> 00:36:00,041
...to trace my actions, or
my whereabouts.

227
00:36:01,252 --> 00:36:03,652
After all these years.
she's become part of my life.

228
00:36:10,661 --> 00:36:12,754
But nothing can remain
the same forever.

229
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:16,360
l have to tell her
that l desperately want out.

230
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:20,596
But l don't know how to start.

231
00:36:22,573 --> 00:36:25,041
So, l've devised another method.

232
00:36:31,415 --> 00:36:33,747
A woman may come in
asking for me.

233
00:36:34,018 --> 00:36:35,508
Please give her this coin...

234
00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:38,277
...and tell her that 1 81 8
is my lucky number.

235
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:55,195
1 81 8...it's the code for one of
the songs in this jukebox.

236
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,107
After she's listened to the song.

237
00:36:58,375 --> 00:37:00,104
...she'll understand my message.

238
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,048
Okay if l sit here?

239
00:38:42,513 --> 00:38:44,913
lt's raining

240
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:51,114
Let's have some fun
Oh, it feels so great

241
00:38:51,522 --> 00:38:53,183
Come on

242
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:13,003
Why?

243
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:16,071
Perhaps l'm tense...

244
00:39:16,614 --> 00:39:17,478
Why?

245
00:39:18,682 --> 00:39:19,842
You coming?

246
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:21,983
No?

247
00:39:24,054 --> 00:39:25,248
Okay

248
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:31,962
Sure you don't want to come?

249
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:34,026
Made up your mind?

250
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:36,091
Forget it

251
00:39:41,939 --> 00:39:45,067
Hey...come and get it

252
00:39:57,021 --> 00:40:00,115
lt's not drying.

253
00:40:02,159 --> 00:40:05,151
l'll take it to the cleaners
for you tomorrow.

254
00:40:05,629 --> 00:40:06,823
Okay?

255
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,732
Did you hear me?

256
00:40:13,604 --> 00:40:15,333
Answer me

257
00:40:18,776 --> 00:40:21,074
Open the door

258
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:30,280
Hmm, nice. Fits you well.

259
00:40:31,855 --> 00:40:33,220
Whose is this?

260
00:40:34,658 --> 00:40:36,023
Why?

261
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:38,861
Do l know you?

262
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,398
You bastard

263
00:40:46,537 --> 00:40:49,199
What are you doing?

264
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,871
Help

265
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,307
What now?

266
00:41:01,218 --> 00:41:03,550
What do you want?

267
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:22,839
What do you want?

268
00:41:24,308 --> 00:41:26,799
l'm overwhelmed

269
00:41:27,144 --> 00:41:28,111
Great

270
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:54,031
Guess why l became a blonde?

271
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:56,299
l don't know.

272
00:41:58,342 --> 00:42:00,333
So no one will forget me.

273
00:42:01,211 --> 00:42:02,576
Looks great

274
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,770
You're making fun of me.

275
00:42:05,082 --> 00:42:07,175
No, you're very special.

276
00:42:07,584 --> 00:42:09,643
l've heard it all before.

277
00:42:09,853 --> 00:42:11,184
From whom?

278
00:42:13,991 --> 00:42:15,083
You

279
00:42:16,126 --> 00:42:18,185
We were together for some time.

280
00:42:18,462 --> 00:42:20,259
l had long hair.

281
00:42:22,132 --> 00:42:25,158
You called me 'Baby'.

282
00:42:26,503 --> 00:42:28,266
Really?

283
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:31,035
Yes.

284
00:42:32,476 --> 00:42:35,240
Let bygones be bygones.

285
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,309
You like me now, that's fine.

286
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:43,811
l didn't say that.

287
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:48,047
l want some female company.

288
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:50,153
Fine.

289
00:42:51,094 --> 00:42:52,618
Just for the night.

290
00:42:54,398 --> 00:42:57,890
Maybe you'll like me
better in the morning.

291
00:46:27,978 --> 00:46:31,243
Get out On your way

292
00:46:32,015 --> 00:46:36,076

00:46:46,229 --> 00:46:47,491

295
00:46:53,603 --> 00:46:55,798
You want to have kids?

296
00:46:56,373 --> 00:46:58,204
What's all this crap?

297
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:03,004
You want to get marrid? Fine

298
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:07,574
l'll marry you...but
l'll need some time.

299
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:11,887
There's no need? Why?
What do you mean?

300
00:47:12,255 --> 00:47:15,122
Oh, you dickhead

301
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:20,819

Well, what a perfect couple

306
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:42,408

308
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:49,849
Chinese style? Me, as a pageboy?

And now you're marrying him
You scheming bitch

321

He doesn't love you

He's using you to bear him

The night's full ofweirdos.

next time l see you.

l wish l could tell her...

339
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:09,993
...you can't solve
problems over the phone.

340
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:12,531
You have to talk, face to face.

341
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:14,833
lt that fails, you can
punch him on the nose.

342
00:50:15,372 --> 00:50:17,704
l keep my thoughts to myself.

343
00:50:18,074 --> 00:50:21,441
But somehow, she appears
to be able to read my mind.

344
00:50:24,547 --> 00:50:27,675
l think you're right. Let's go.

345
00:50:47,537 --> 00:50:52,099
Blondie, l know you're there
Come out ifyou've got the guts

346
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:54,970
We're gonna torch the place

347
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:57,241
One, two, three

348
00:50:58,815 --> 00:50:59,645
Wrong floor

349
00:51:01,651 --> 00:51:04,381
Blondie Come on out

350
00:51:04,421 --> 00:51:09,222
3 seconds and you burn
One, two, three

00:51:11,194 --> 00:51:12,718
Let's try the next floor.

352
00:51:15,165 --> 00:51:16,189
ls that a wig?

353
00:51:16,466 --> 00:51:18,957
No way, it comes with age

354
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:22,069
Looks blond, not grey.
You related to Blondie?

355
00:51:22,772 --> 00:51:24,433
l don't know any Blondie.

356
00:51:24,674 --> 00:51:26,164
Her nickname's 'Stowaway'
Well?

357
00:51:26,443 --> 00:51:29,276
- Funny name
- ls she your chick?

358
00:51:29,546 --> 00:51:32,014
Leave me alone, you loonies

359
00:51:32,716 --> 00:51:35,583
Pervert Follow her...

360
00:51:36,786 --> 00:51:38,754
- ls Blondie your daughter?
- No.

361
00:51:39,022 --> 00:51:41,991
l can see a resemblance.
You've forgotten her?

362
00:51:42,258 --> 00:51:44,089
- Think hard
- Leave it

363
00:51:44,327 --> 00:51:46,227
We searched high and low
all night.

364
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:49,329
l don't think she knows
where this blondie lives.

365
00:51:49,933 --> 00:51:51,230
l give up.

366
00:51:51,868 --> 00:51:56,202
Everyone protects her, hides
her away. Where the hell is she?

367
00:51:56,473 --> 00:51:58,338
Why won't anyone help me?

368
00:51:58,608 --> 00:52:00,269
The slut

369
00:52:00,577 --> 00:52:03,273
lt's not fair
What kind of game is this?

370
00:52:03,513 --> 00:52:05,140
l'm not playing anymore

371
00:52:05,382 --> 00:52:08,146
You must have slept with her.

372
00:52:08,418 --> 00:52:12,411
l bet you have, but you won't
admit it. Right?

373
00:52:12,789 --> 00:52:14,552
You on vacation?

374
00:52:14,858 --> 00:52:18,021
Think the whole world's
on your side, bitch?

375
00:52:29,072 --> 00:52:30,733
Blondie

376
00:52:31,508 --> 00:52:35,308
You slut You dare show
your face? You're finished

377
00:52:36,146 --> 00:52:40,207
You bitch Slut Tramp

378
00:52:40,517 --> 00:52:43,577
Fuck you You bitch

379
00:52:48,658 --> 00:52:51,821
Where does all this energy
come from?

380
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,667
Stop eating - watch the door.

381
00:52:58,935 --> 00:53:01,267
Blondie could show up
any minute now.

382
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:03,597
She comes here with her dad.

383
00:53:07,677 --> 00:53:10,373
How do you spell 'Blondie'?

384
00:53:14,751 --> 00:53:18,209
Oh, what the hell...

385
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:21,952
Listen to this.

386
00:53:22,192 --> 00:53:26,526
l, Blondie, a.k.a. Stowaway,
behaved in an ugly & shameless way.

387
00:53:26,796 --> 00:53:29,890
l'm returning Johnny Kwong to his
rightful girlfriend Charlie Young.

388
00:53:30,166 --> 00:53:32,726
l hereby terminate all
relations with him.

389
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:36,995
Our signatures binding until
death. Great. You think so?

390
00:53:38,541 --> 00:53:41,009
l'll make Blondie sign this.

391
00:53:41,277 --> 00:53:43,905
Must get her fingerprints
and l.D. number on it.

392
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:46,978
Get her dad as a witness.
photograph them together.

393
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:48,512
Blondie?

394
00:53:49,552 --> 00:53:50,883
You're Blondie?

395
00:53:56,092 --> 00:53:57,491
You're Blondie?

396
00:53:57,727 --> 00:53:58,853
Yeah, so what?

397
00:54:02,298 --> 00:54:03,993
Hey, you Blondie?

398
00:54:05,201 --> 00:54:09,399
l'll fucking chop you
into little pieces

399
00:54:53,883 --> 00:54:56,044
They say women are
made ofwater.

400
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:57,752
So are some men.

401
00:54:58,955 --> 00:55:01,515
Most folk experience first love
in their teens.

402
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:03,921
l was a bit older.

403
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:06,322
Maybe l'm too choosy.

404
00:55:07,163 --> 00:55:10,064
On May 30th, 1 995...

405
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,359
...l fell in love for the first time.

406
00:55:12,835 --> 00:55:15,065
lt was raining that night.

407
00:55:15,939 --> 00:55:17,873
l looked at her...

408
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:21,042
...and had this feeling
like l was a store.

409
00:55:21,444 --> 00:55:23,435
...and that she was me.

410
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:27,141
Without any warning, she
suddenly enters the store.

411
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:31,811
l don't know how long she'll stay
The longer the better, of course.

412
00:57:22,632 --> 00:57:26,033
When did you last wash?
You need a bath.

413
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:29,065
Huh? You stink all over

414
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:33,835
When did you dye your hair?

415
00:57:38,247 --> 00:57:40,579
They say love can change a man.

416
00:57:40,883 --> 00:57:44,512
l find myself looking handsome
and becoming more charming.

417
00:57:44,787 --> 00:57:47,813
Suddenly, l discover
my hair's turning blond.

418
00:57:48,157 --> 00:57:50,455
Perhaps it's because
my mum was Russian.

419
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:54,056
Dad speaks in a Taiwanese
dialect...

420
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:56,127
...which no on can understand...

421
00:57:57,467 --> 00:57:59,059
...because of his strong
Russian accent.

422
00:57:59,302 --> 00:58:01,634
Hello? Chungking Mansions.

423
00:58:02,038 --> 00:58:04,632
Who's speaking? Blondie?

424
00:58:21,691 --> 00:58:24,091
On June 22nd, 1 995...

425
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:27,952
...the ltalian team Sampdoria
came to play in Hong Kong.

426
00:58:28,297 --> 00:58:30,231
l took Charlie to the match.

427
00:58:30,633 --> 00:58:32,464
She's a fan of Ruud Gullit.

428
00:58:33,836 --> 00:58:36,270
She was ecstatic that night.

429
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:40,173
She insisted in staying on
after the game.

430
00:58:40,443 --> 00:58:44,880
lt's not right
What was the point of playing?

431
00:58:45,748 --> 00:58:50,344
They had the better team.
Our boys were outclassed

432
00:58:51,287 --> 00:58:55,519
There's no miracles in this
world. Fat chance

433
00:58:59,095 --> 00:59:01,188
Do you know why l came?

434
00:59:02,965 --> 00:59:06,662
l was actually hoping
for a miracle.

435
00:59:07,170 --> 00:59:10,571
Johnny's a great fan of Gullit.

436
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,501
l thought he would come.

437
00:59:13,042 --> 00:59:16,409
He wouldn't have had time.
He's getting married tomorrow.

438
00:59:18,281 --> 00:59:20,613
Guess why l was
yelling and waving...

439
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:24,876
...and acting crazy earlier?
l hoped he'd see me on TV.

440
00:59:32,128 --> 00:59:36,292
He promised me he'd come
So why didn't he?

441
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:43,467
l realise that she still misses
Johnny, but it hurts me.

442
00:59:43,739 --> 00:59:46,833
But l'm an optimistic person.
lt's said...

443
00:59:47,577 --> 00:59:49,511
...nothing remains the same forever.

444
00:59:49,846 --> 00:59:52,337
But will it apply
to Johnny and Charlie?

445
00:59:53,249 --> 00:59:55,308
Time will tell. l suppose.

446
01:00:10,766 --> 01:00:12,825
Perhaps l'm being
a bit too optimistic.

447
01:00:13,970 --> 01:00:17,406
A few days later, l invited
her to another match.

448
01:00:18,274 --> 01:00:19,764
She didn't turn up.

449
01:00:21,444 --> 01:00:24,345
l really thought she'd soon
get over Johnny.

450
01:00:25,515 --> 01:00:29,611
How wrong could l have been?
lt was me she got over.

451
01:00:33,322 --> 01:00:35,813
l stayed on after the match.

452
01:00:36,325 --> 01:00:40,159
As the stadium lights dimmed.
l redlised she wouldn't show.

453
01:00:40,396 --> 01:00:43,092
l'm heartbroken.
Not a hope

454
01:00:51,374 --> 01:00:53,808
They say 'love hurts'...

455
01:00:54,243 --> 01:00:56,438
...but it's different with me.

456
01:01:03,953 --> 01:01:05,045
Something strange happens.
My hair changes colour.

457
01:01:05,421 --> 01:01:06,149
Just like with my first love.

458
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:09,424
l also realised how irresponsible
l had been in the past.

459
01:01:11,027 --> 01:01:14,656
l shouldn't have taken over
other people's shops...

460
01:01:14,864 --> 01:01:16,695
...the way l did.

461
01:01:16,933 --> 01:01:19,231
Every shop
must have its own feeling.

462
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,902
This realisation cheered me up
and prompted me...

463
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:25,703
...to change my life.

464
01:01:40,256 --> 01:01:41,553
Welcome.

465
01:01:43,259 --> 01:01:44,624
Just for one.

466
01:01:45,695 --> 01:01:49,461
We'll have a new menu
next time you come.

467
01:01:49,999 --> 01:01:51,159
Am l keeping you?

468
01:01:54,103 --> 01:01:56,537
Get a glass. Be my guest.

469
01:02:07,016 --> 01:02:08,074
How's business?

470
01:02:21,731 --> 01:02:24,427
What's it cost to set up
a place like this?

471
01:02:40,549 --> 01:02:45,612
Hi, there.
You interested in a business?

472
01:02:47,490 --> 01:02:50,789
Just wondered how much
a place like this cost.

473
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,789
At least a million.

474
01:02:53,162 --> 01:02:56,427
When you live out of a suitcase...

475
01:02:56,666 --> 01:02:59,464
...you don't need a place
ofyour own.

476
01:03:00,469 --> 01:03:02,266
Things have changed, though.

477
01:03:02,538 --> 01:03:05,029
Got to start planning ahead.

478
01:03:05,908 --> 01:03:08,376
l had a good chat that evening.

479
01:03:08,778 --> 01:03:10,678
He even offered to help me...

480
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:15,974
...if l started up my own place.

481
01:03:16,886 --> 01:03:18,581
- Another beer?
- Why not?

482
01:03:37,506 --> 01:03:39,667
What are you really worth?

483
01:03:54,523 --> 01:03:57,014
l'd stayed away from the bar
for some time.

484
01:03:57,626 --> 01:04:00,026
l couldn't bear hearing
that song.

485
01:04:02,398 --> 01:04:04,958
But some things you can't
escape from.

486
01:04:05,901 --> 01:04:09,098
So, after that evening,
l never went back.

487
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:13,638
Happy birthday to you

488
01:04:44,273 --> 01:04:47,868
Happy birthday to you

489
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:52,408
Happy birthday to you

490
01:04:52,815 --> 01:04:56,876
Happy birthday, happy birthday

491
01:04:57,153 --> 01:05:03,114
Happy birthday to you

492
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:07,022
- Okay?
- Good.

493
01:05:41,764 --> 01:05:43,425
How are you?

494
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:48,964
Dad's fine. No need to worry.

495
01:05:52,308 --> 01:05:54,902
l know it's your birthday soon.

496
01:05:55,411 --> 01:05:57,845
Sorry l can't be with you.

497
01:05:59,148 --> 01:06:02,345
ls mum feeling better now?

498
01:06:03,819 --> 01:06:08,518
ls your sister okay?
Doing well at school?

499
01:06:12,895 --> 01:06:14,590
How was that?

500
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:17,428
Sato-san loves his family
very much.

501
01:06:18,100 --> 01:06:22,969
Before his present job he
used to be a film director.

502
01:06:23,239 --> 01:06:26,402
So whenever he has family
business to talk about...

503
01:06:26,642 --> 01:06:29,110
...he just makes a video recording.

504
01:06:30,379 --> 01:06:34,645
l'm sure his son gets great
pleasure in receiving the tapes.

505
01:06:35,417 --> 01:06:38,215
l'd like to do the same...

506
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:40,718
...but who would l send
the tapes to?

507
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:44,457
l can't really send them
to myself.

508
01:07:53,929 --> 01:07:56,159
Maybe l could be like
Sato-san's son...

509
01:07:56,832 --> 01:07:59,300
...and imagine the happiness
he gets from the tapes.

510
01:08:01,003 --> 01:08:02,800
How much for a double room?

511
01:08:03,072 --> 01:08:04,630
With twin beds?

512
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:05,602
Yes...

513
01:08:05,808 --> 01:08:08,038
Twin room - four fifty.

514
01:08:08,310 --> 01:08:09,834
Too damned expensive.

515
01:08:10,412 --> 01:08:12,437
You've got to be kidding.

516
01:08:17,853 --> 01:08:19,718
Forget it

517
01:08:19,989 --> 01:08:21,581
Calm down...

518
01:09:16,345 --> 01:09:18,677
Stop filming
Go to bed

519
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:30,858
That's enough
Go on, get out of here

520
01:10:33,622 --> 01:10:35,817
Later that night...

521
01:10:36,191 --> 01:10:38,989
...l caught dad having a
sneak look at the tape.

522
01:10:39,461 --> 01:10:41,224
He really enjoyed it.

523
01:10:42,197 --> 01:10:44,495
My memory's not that good.
but...

524
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:49,534
...l did remember that it was
his 60th birthday.

525
01:10:50,739 --> 01:10:54,937
God knows why. But he gets
great amusement watching it.

526
01:10:55,244 --> 01:10:57,508
And l do know that he's happy.

527
01:10:59,615 --> 01:11:01,378
Silly devil...

528
01:11:25,174 --> 01:11:27,574
Working with someone
for a long time...

529
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:30,539
...you're bound to be influenced
in some way.

530
01:11:30,812 --> 01:11:32,746
l know that fragrance...

531
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:37,543
...but l'm not used to smelling
it on other women.

532
01:11:44,793 --> 01:11:47,284
This suits me just fine.

533
01:11:47,896 --> 01:11:50,660
lt's shrunk a bit, though.

534
01:11:55,537 --> 01:11:58,836
l always thought the perfume
was a bit overpowering.

535
01:12:00,042 --> 01:12:03,534
l smelt it on this other woman
this afternoon.

536
01:12:04,513 --> 01:12:06,640
She wants to see you.

537
01:12:07,015 --> 01:12:09,040
l fixed up a meeting.

538
01:12:10,686 --> 01:12:11,744
Will you go?

539
01:12:16,925 --> 01:12:20,520
l think you should go and
get things sorted out.

540
01:12:23,966 --> 01:12:26,230
Perhaps it's not such a good idea.

541
01:12:32,874 --> 01:12:35,035
Anyway, l thought you'd go.

542
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:37,873
This is for you.

543
01:13:31,733 --> 01:13:33,291
l'd like...

544
01:13:34,403 --> 01:13:35,961
...a packet of crisps.

545
01:13:36,638 --> 01:13:39,106
Not the red pack, the yellow

546
01:14:16,578 --> 01:14:19,046
They sit there together
for ages.

547
01:14:19,614 --> 01:14:21,605
l wonder what they're talking about?

548
01:14:22,050 --> 01:14:25,383
Meanwhile the rain keeps
bucketing down.

549
01:14:25,721 --> 01:14:29,657
lt's raining so heavily, how will
l get home by myself?

550
01:14:45,874 --> 01:14:48,502
And just when l need
a raincoat...

551
01:14:49,378 --> 01:14:51,437
...he appears at my side.

552
01:14:54,583 --> 01:14:56,414
l hope the rain...

553
01:14:57,819 --> 01:14:59,081
...will never stop.

554
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:06,052
l'm not coming in.

555
01:15:06,661 --> 01:15:12,156
Then why walk me home?

556
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:16,900
You could've let me walk

557
01:15:17,172 --> 01:15:19,231
l was going to do that anyway.

558
01:15:19,541 --> 01:15:22,339
You trying to be funny?

559
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:26,803
Oh, what the hell
Just fuck off, will you?

560
01:15:30,819 --> 01:15:32,377
We came to an agreement.

561
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:34,485
l never agreed anything

562
01:15:35,123 --> 01:15:38,684
You insisted on seeing her, not me
What d'you want from me now?

563
01:15:40,529 --> 01:15:44,260
You think l'm stupid?
Oh, get lost

564
01:15:47,402 --> 01:15:50,132
You're a cheat and a liar

565
01:15:55,177 --> 01:15:57,407
Give me your hand...

566
01:16:03,418 --> 01:16:06,910
Why?

567
01:16:07,189 --> 01:16:09,419
l've left my mark, okay?

568
01:16:09,991 --> 01:16:13,722
You may forget my face, but
you won't forget my bite

569
01:16:16,932 --> 01:16:19,560
l'm easily recognised, though...

570
01:16:19,868 --> 01:16:23,531
...by the mole on my face.

571
01:16:23,805 --> 01:16:27,502
lf a woman with a mole on her
face ever comes up to you...

572
01:16:28,944 --> 01:16:31,606
...it could be me.

573
01:16:35,116 --> 01:16:37,482
Will you remember that?

574
01:16:41,256 --> 01:16:42,985
l'll remember.

575
01:17:09,885 --> 01:17:11,978
Will l remember her?

576
01:17:13,788 --> 01:17:15,881
Actually, it's not important.

577
01:17:16,191 --> 01:17:21,128
For her l was an oasis in
her journey through life.

578
01:17:21,396 --> 01:17:23,523
l hope she soon reaches
her destination...

579
01:17:23,798 --> 01:17:26,460
...and finds her soulmate
for life.

580
01:17:26,735 --> 01:17:28,669
We all need a partner.

581
01:17:30,438 --> 01:17:32,668
When will l find mine?

582
01:17:40,916 --> 01:17:42,713
Are we will partners?

583
01:18:01,970 --> 01:18:06,407
l don't know how to answer
her question.

584
01:18:06,708 --> 01:18:10,405
l've come to look at partners
from a new angle.

585
01:18:11,546 --> 01:18:13,639
As a business partner,
she's perfect...

586
01:18:13,982 --> 01:18:18,442
...but not one you could
spend your life with.

587
01:18:20,822 --> 01:18:23,552
l'm terminating
our business relationship.

588
01:18:36,538 --> 01:18:39,268
Do me one last favour, will you?

589
01:18:46,982 --> 01:18:48,711
l don't know why l agreed.

590
01:18:49,417 --> 01:18:51,612
Probably because it's a last favour.

591
01:19:17,979 --> 01:19:19,810
l want to place an advert
for my friend.

592
01:19:24,419 --> 01:19:26,216
l want the front page.

593
01:22:53,394 --> 01:22:58,627
The best thing about my job -
l don't have to make decisions.

594
01:22:59,467 --> 01:23:05,201
Who's to die, when and where,
it's all been planned by others.

595
01:23:08,343 --> 01:23:09,901
l'm a lazy person.

596
01:23:11,112 --> 01:23:13,580
l like others to arrange things for me.

597
01:23:15,216 --> 01:23:17,616
But l've been doing some
thinking lately.

598
01:23:18,019 --> 01:23:20,487
l feel the need for change.

599
01:23:21,656 --> 01:23:23,681
Whether it's right or wrong...

600
01:23:24,592 --> 01:23:28,028
...l must make a decision
for myself.

601
01:24:11,239 --> 01:24:13,104
'Being photographed will
shorten your life'.

602
01:24:14,175 --> 01:24:16,234
Seems there's some truth in it.

603
01:24:17,378 --> 01:24:19,437
One evening,
dad was taken ill.

604
01:24:20,281 --> 01:24:21,942
l took him to hospital.

605
01:24:23,718 --> 01:24:26,448
A little later, he passed away.

606
01:24:29,123 --> 01:24:30,681
Thanks to him, all my life...

607
01:24:30,725 --> 01:24:33,592
...l've always felt like
a little boy.

608
01:24:35,029 --> 01:24:38,157
He was always there to
sort out my problems.

609
01:24:39,834 --> 01:24:42,701
Packing his things away
that evening...

610
01:24:42,737 --> 01:24:49,666
He was always there to
sort out my problems.

611
01:24:49,711 --> 01:25:10,794
Packing his things away
that evening...

612
01:25:11,733 --> 01:25:12,461
...l felt grown-up for the first time.

613
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:13,933
l didn't want to be grown-up...
...l just wanted dad with me.

614
01:25:13,968 --> 01:25:16,596
When l left the hotel...

615
01:25:16,938 --> 01:25:17,836
...l took the videotapes with me.

616
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:19,403
l watched them
over and over again.

617
01:27:04,745 --> 01:27:07,714
Watching dad cooking
made me very happy.

618
01:27:09,217 --> 01:27:13,176
l know l'll never taste
his steaks again...

619
01:27:13,721 --> 01:27:17,054
...but l'll never forget
just how they tasted.

620
01:27:23,364 --> 01:27:26,162
Oh, hell, it's you again

621
01:27:26,434 --> 01:27:28,129
Not the hair Leave it...

622
01:27:29,403 --> 01:27:32,770
l'm happy to be your client.

623
01:27:33,241 --> 01:27:35,106
Did l ever refuse?

624
01:27:35,576 --> 01:27:37,601
l didn't, did l?

625
01:27:37,879 --> 01:27:40,643
Just look at me
Let go of me...

626
01:27:40,882 --> 01:27:42,873
My wife's visiting China...

627
01:27:43,151 --> 01:27:46,143
...and l've some business
to attend to.

628
01:27:46,487 --> 01:27:49,115
Give me three hours and
l'll be back.

629
01:27:49,357 --> 01:27:52,087
Three hours, okay?
Three hours...

630
01:27:53,494 --> 01:27:55,155
Two hours?

631
01:27:55,396 --> 01:27:57,762
Two hours and l'll be back. Deal?

632
01:27:58,866 --> 01:28:03,394
Trust me. We're old friends,
aren't we?

633
01:28:03,437 --> 01:28:06,998
People cross all the time.
Two hours...

634
01:28:07,308 --> 01:28:11,369
Trust me, you have my word
We're like brothers, right?

635
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:15,780
You want it written in blood?

636
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:18,314
You're kidding, right?

637
01:28:18,719 --> 01:28:21,017
Leave it out...

638
01:28:21,289 --> 01:28:24,383
Just one hour, okay?

639
01:28:24,659 --> 01:28:28,288
Don't do this...
have mercy... Wait...

640
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:33,928
Can l have some
small change, please?

641
01:28:40,808 --> 01:28:41,797
Thanks.

642
01:28:46,314 --> 01:28:48,942
l'm downstairs already.

643
01:28:49,283 --> 01:28:51,945
l'm waiting for you. 'Bye.

644
01:29:01,028 --> 01:29:03,622
Talk about bad timing...

645
01:29:04,031 --> 01:29:08,195
Shortly after dad died,
Sato-san returned to Japan.

646
01:29:09,237 --> 01:29:11,637
l haven't got much money saved...

647
01:29:11,672 --> 01:29:15,108
...so l can only do what l'm
best at - being my own boss.

648
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:18,438
l'm being very cautious this time.

649
01:29:18,479 --> 01:29:21,073
l pick only the stronger ones.

650
01:29:21,115 --> 01:29:23,743
Ones that won't get hurt easily.

651
01:29:24,051 --> 01:29:27,111
Take this one for example.
guts of steel.

652
01:29:27,388 --> 01:29:29,356
Saves a lot of hassle.

653
01:29:29,890 --> 01:29:33,018
Sometimes l run into
old acquaintances.

654
01:29:33,060 --> 01:29:35,722
Some haven't changed at all.

655
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:38,555
Others l hardly recognise.

656
01:29:39,066 --> 01:29:41,500
l'm always glad to see them...

657
01:29:41,836 --> 01:29:44,999
...even though they may not
remember me.

658
01:29:46,340 --> 01:29:50,299
Of course, there are some
exceptions to the rule.

659
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:53,273
On August 29th, 1 995...

660
01:29:53,547 --> 01:29:56,448
...l ran into my first love again.

661
01:29:56,484 --> 01:29:58,714
l don't think she recognised me.

662
01:30:00,821 --> 01:30:03,312
l guess l'm more handsome now.

663
01:30:11,666 --> 01:30:14,100
- You're late.
- Sorry.

664
01:30:14,402 --> 01:30:17,860
- What's up with him?
- l've no idea.

665
01:30:34,455 --> 01:30:37,424
lt turned quite cold that evening.

666
01:30:38,426 --> 01:30:41,953
l hadn't expected winter
to come so soon.

667
01:30:48,302 --> 01:30:50,702
l'm not used to this
kind ofweather.

668
01:30:52,106 --> 01:30:55,667
lt seems to have been
a long winter.

669
01:30:56,544 --> 01:30:59,707
Although l eat well every day...

670
01:31:00,581 --> 01:31:02,742
...l still feel cold.

671
01:31:03,484 --> 01:31:07,045
l've got used to working alone.

672
01:31:08,723 --> 01:31:13,319
Occasionally l do work
with others...

673
01:31:13,361 --> 01:31:16,797
...but not on a regular basis.

674
01:31:17,898 --> 01:31:20,662
l've learnt to be more careful.

675
01:31:21,836 --> 01:31:26,170
For instance, l won't work
in hotels any more.

676
01:31:26,741 --> 01:31:29,835
And no more checking out
rubbish bins.

677
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:33,102
l firmly believe...

678
01:31:33,414 --> 01:31:37,350
...one mustn't get emotionally
involved with one's partner.

679
01:32:35,109 --> 01:32:37,703
We rub shoulders with many
people every day.

680
01:32:38,612 --> 01:32:42,309
Some may become close friends,
or confidants.

681
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:45,810
That's why l'm always optimistic.

682
01:32:47,154 --> 01:32:49,247
Sometimes it hurts.

683
01:32:49,657 --> 01:32:52,455
Not to worry -
l try to stay happy.

684
01:32:57,598 --> 01:33:01,193
That night,
l saw that woman again.

685
01:33:01,469 --> 01:33:04,438
l knew we'd never be friends
or confidants...

686
01:33:04,672 --> 01:33:08,073
...we'd let too many chances
pass us by.

687
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:12,243
Nothing happened,
there was no chemistry.

688
01:33:12,646 --> 01:33:15,080
Maybe it was the weather...

689
01:33:15,416 --> 01:33:18,977
...but that night
l found her very alluring.

690
01:33:55,289 --> 01:34:00,022
l'm about to leave,
l ask him to take me home.

691
01:34:00,561 --> 01:34:03,997
l haven't ridden pillion
for a long time...

692
01:34:04,331 --> 01:34:07,926
...nor have l been this close
to a man in ages.

693
01:34:08,969 --> 01:34:12,427
The road home isn't very long...

694
01:34:13,307 --> 01:34:17,175
...and l know l'll be
getting off soon.

695
01:34:17,211 --> 01:34:19,736
But at this moment, l'm feeling
such lovely warmth.
