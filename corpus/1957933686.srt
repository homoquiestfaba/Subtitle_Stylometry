1
00:00:23,917 --> 00:00:25,541
Oh, shit!

2
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:30,874
Don't you run!

3
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,708
Don't you fucking run!

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,833
Ah!

5
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:01,833
Oh!

6
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:03,917
Oh!

7
00:01:04,917 --> 00:01:05,917
Oh!

8
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:07,750
Oh!

9
00:01:10,583 --> 00:01:13,333
Now, where's my fuckin' money?

10
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,666
You think I'm fuckin' around?

11
00:01:16,667 --> 00:01:18,166
No, no, no.

12
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,582
What'd you say?

13
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:20,417
No, no, yeah.

14
00:01:20,418 --> 00:01:22,374
You told me you would pay me back

15
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:24,457
when you sold your film.

16
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:25,916
That's what you said, remember?

17
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:26,917
Yeah.

18
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:29,249
You sold the fuckin'
thing, so fuckin' pay me.

19
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,541
10,000 by next week, or
I'll shoot your fuckin' dog.

20
00:01:33,542 --> 00:01:36,207
Wait, I don't have a dog.

21
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:37,332
- Cats.
- No.

22
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:38,541
- Hamster.
- No.

23
00:01:38,542 --> 00:01:39,875
- Goldfish.
- No.

24
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:43,207
- Your grandma, then.
- No, no.

25
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,624
Yeah.

26
00:01:44,625 --> 00:01:46,707
I'll shoot your fuckin' grandma.

27
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:47,957
Wait, it was 5,000.

28
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:49,332
Plus the interest, you little shit.

29
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:50,167
"Fuck you. Pay me."

30
00:01:50,168 --> 00:01:52,999
Do you know that line? That movie?

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Good stuff.

32
00:01:54,001 --> 00:01:56,832
You got problems, I don't care.

33
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:58,250
Fuck you. Pay me!

34
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:00,208
10,000?

35
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:03,499
Ten fucking thousand, by next week.

36
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,791
Okay, got it.

37
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:06,499
And if you,

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,416
if you try to ditch me.

39
00:02:08,417 --> 00:02:09,417
Pop, pop!

40
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,375
No more grandma cookies.

41
00:02:13,208 --> 00:02:14,042
You get me?

42
00:02:14,043 --> 00:02:15,624
Yes, I got you.

43
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,625
I got it.

44
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:24,499
You're a good kid.

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,833
Tell grandma I said hello.

46
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:29,416
- What?
- Nothing, nothing.

47
00:02:29,417 --> 00:02:30,791
Well, ho-ho-ho, motherfucker.

48
00:02:30,792 --> 00:02:32,999
You're not gonna wish
me a merry Christmas?

49
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,292
Merry Christmas?

50
00:02:36,542 --> 00:02:37,542
Good.

51
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:40,917
Now get out my face and go get my money.

52
00:03:04,792 --> 00:03:05,792
Hey.

53
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,667
Anything?

54
00:03:10,125 --> 00:03:12,499
Shit, what happened to you?

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,500
Marco.

56
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:19,750
He gave us a card.

57
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,166
Ugh, it's gettin' worse, huh?

58
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,458
Yeah, yeah.

59
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:26,499
Anyway, did you call?

60
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,542
Uh, I called.

61
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,833
Sent an email, sent a
notarized fuckin' letter.

62
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:33,791
He's ghosting us.

63
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:35,083
Not cool, man.

64
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:37,791
Well, osh, call again.

65
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:41,499
Ivan, I've called a
thousand fucking times.

66
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,666
Lust get the same voicemail
over and over again.

67
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:47,124
"This is Max rampage!

68
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,582
Rampage media.

69
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:50,082
Largest distributor of horror films

70
00:03:50,083 --> 00:03:50,958
in the entire fucking world."

71
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,291
Blah-blah-blah-blah-blegh.

72
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,666
I think we're screwed, man.

73
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,624
Hey, we owe everyone money.

74
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,542
Casting crew was on deferments.

75
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,999
Even Lauren's mad at me.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,332
That's fucked.

77
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,541
I'm sorry, bro.

78
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:09,207
We, uh, where were we?

79
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,916
- Money.
- Right, money.

80
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,457
Yeah, uh.

81
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,666
Good news.

82
00:04:13,667 --> 00:04:14,957
If we don't start paying off our loans,

83
00:04:14,958 --> 00:04:16,957
they're gonna kick us out
of the dorm this month.

84
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:18,707
Merry Christmas.

85
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,500
Josh, what are we gonna do now, bro?

86
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,000
I don't know.

87
00:04:24,042 --> 00:04:26,500
But I gotta go to work.

88
00:04:27,417 --> 00:04:29,833
You won't have to deliver
pizzas forever, bro.

89
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,582
You know, I've made more
money delivering pizzas

90
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:35,125
than I ever did as a filmmaker?

91
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:39,375
You're a great writer, osh.

92
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:41,833
Youust need a break.

93
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,583
Yeah, don't we all.

94
00:05:03,542 --> 00:05:04,542
My gosh.

95
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,208
Ugh.

96
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:14,500
So?

97
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Hold on.

98
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,042
Well?

99
00:05:25,043 --> 00:05:28,000
Hold on.

100
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:33,667
And?

101
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,124
Looks like we're making a movie.

102
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,125
Oh! Yeah!

103
00:05:40,417 --> 00:05:42,249
Where are we gonna get the money?

104
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,874
School. I know a guy.

105
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,875
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

106
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:46,917
What's his name?

107
00:05:46,918 --> 00:05:48,833
Marco something-or-another.

108
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,374
He wants to fund our movie?

109
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,958
He'll loan us the money, yeah.

110
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:57,250
Gmm!

111
00:05:57,251 --> 00:05:58,624
I guess we're makin' a movie, man!

112
00:05:58,625 --> 00:05:59,625
Yeah!

113
00:06:03,792 --> 00:06:05,291
Oh, shit!

114
00:06:05,292 --> 00:06:06,292
Fuck!

115
00:06:13,167 --> 00:06:15,249
Hey, Ivan. What's up?

116
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,083
Oh, we'reust makin' a movie.

117
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,000
Oh, cool.

118
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,541
Could we like audition?

119
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,042
Yeah, of course.

120
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,624
- Dude.
- Huh?

121
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:23,625
Oh, yeah.

122
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,333
Uh, mmm-hmm.

123
00:06:25,334 --> 00:06:26,707
- Thanks!
- See ya later.

124
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:27,625
Yeah.

125
00:06:27,626 --> 00:06:29,542
Yeah, you too.

126
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:33,624
Josh, let's go.

127
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:35,208
This way. Let's go.

128
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:13,832
Oh, hi!

129
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,917
Yeah, you can come on in.

130
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:25,541
You guys are makin' a movie?

131
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,749
I mean, you are, right?

132
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,041
I saw the signs everywhere.

133
00:07:30,042 --> 00:07:32,291
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's us.

134
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:33,292
Can I help?

135
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:35,874
Are you an actress?

136
00:07:35,875 --> 00:07:36,750
No.

137
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:38,499
What about crew?

138
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,333
No.

139
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,332
Maybe. I don't know.

140
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:44,291
Okay, you got any experience?

141
00:07:44,292 --> 00:07:46,208
I like horror movies.

142
00:07:47,917 --> 00:07:48,957
And I'll work for free.

143
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,166
- You're in.
- Awesome.

144
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,499
Wait, you said you like horror movies.

145
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,458
Yeah.

146
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,249
I'must, I'm serious.

147
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,374
I'm asking because we
don't have any horror fans

148
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:00,332
on our crew.

149
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,291
I mean, Ivan here is a, uh, rom-com fan.

150
00:08:03,292 --> 00:08:05,416
He likes to cry himself to sleep at night.

151
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:06,499
It's true.

152
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,833
I'm a very lonely man.

153
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,332
I still cry when I masturbate.

154
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,791
- I, uh.
- Um.

155
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:12,625
Ignore him, please.

156
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:14,707
He's, he's an idiot.

157
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:15,874
I'must asking, you know?

158
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:16,875
Fan to fan.

159
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,166
Okay, well.

160
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,291
Lately I've been really
into Italian retro horror.

161
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:26,291
You know, like Freda, bavo, bulriva.

162
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,666
Fulci, argento, of course.

163
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:31,458
But I have to go back to, hmm.

164
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:38,082
Let's say "no one gets out
alive," the 73rd version.

165
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,166
I saw it the first year with
my dad at a horror revival

166
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:43,458
when I was like six, I think?

167
00:08:44,292 --> 00:08:46,541
Yeah, we used to go all the time.

168
00:08:46,542 --> 00:08:47,582
Okay, yeah.

169
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:48,666
I mean, I can dig it.

170
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:50,832
It's a little obscure, but uh, yeah.

171
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,791
It was pivotal to the
American stalk and slash

172
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,166
type of movies and kind of had that bird

173
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:59,166
with the crystal plumage
vibe, ust a tighter story.

174
00:08:59,167 --> 00:09:00,749
So, yeah.

175
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,999
Yeah, I can agree with that.

176
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,875
Cool, yeah.

177
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:03,708
What's your name?

178
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,999
Oh, essica.

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,707
Well, I'mosh. I'm the writer/director.

180
00:09:06,708 --> 00:09:11,624
And this is Ivan, the uh, the
crying masturbator, I guess.

181
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:12,458
Hey.

182
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:14,042
Oh, no. I'm good.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Uh.

184
00:09:18,417 --> 00:09:20,582
For the record, I'm ambidextrous.

185
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:24,291
I, eh.

186
00:09:24,292 --> 00:09:25,957
Anyway, aren't you a little young to be

187
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:27,624
a film school student?

188
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:29,499
Aren't you a little old?

189
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,582
Ow.

190
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:34,082
Josh dropped out of real
college to go to film school.

191
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,291
Yeah, and I got the
student debt to prove it.

192
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,042
- Mmm, that sucks.
- Yeah, it does.

193
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:43,000
So now what?

194
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,542
Mmm, you wanna help with auditions?

195
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,000
- Yeah, scoot over.
- Cool.

196
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,958
No-ho-ho!

197
00:09:58,625 --> 00:10:02,083
Ned, if you stay, he's
gonna turn you into meat.

198
00:10:03,792 --> 00:10:04,625
All right, kids.

199
00:10:04,626 --> 00:10:06,624
Are you guys ready for the
best hike of your lives?

200
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,582
We got...

201
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:10,582
This is gonna be the
best hike of your life.

202
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,499
We're gonna find all sorts
of warm, cuddly animals,

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:16,749
like bears and snakes,
and maybe we'll even find

204
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,916
a honey badger.

205
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,332
Sorry, camp wannabe warriors.

206
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:20,832
Looks like old bungalow bill has eaten

207
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:22,292
all the hiking snacks.

208
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:25,833
Uh, line?

209
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:27,082
No.

210
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,457
Not you!

211
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,041
Don't give up!

212
00:10:30,042 --> 00:10:33,749
He'll, he'll kill you if you stay.

213
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,249
He'll turn you into meat!

214
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,457
Oh, ned!

215
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,791
No, no, no, no, no!

216
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:44,875
Be my food!

217
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:52,749
Jarvis, this stew tastes funny,

218
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,874
and not like a clown with a meat cleaver

219
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,792
at midnight kind of funny.

220
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,499
More like when you're drunk
aunt tries to French you

221
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,708
at your college graduation.

222
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:07,625
No, no!

223
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,832
No, no, no!

224
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:15,499
We got snakes and bears,
and uh, honey badgers.

225
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,250
Um, maybe we'll look at some trees.

226
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:19,208
Uh.

227
00:11:24,792 --> 00:11:25,792
I know!

228
00:11:26,542 --> 00:11:28,082
Let me do that one more time.

229
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:33,083
Jarvis, this stew tastes funny.

230
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,916
Not like a clown at midnight
with a meat cleaver funny,

231
00:11:36,917 --> 00:11:40,916
but more like when your drunk
aunt tries to French kiss you

232
00:11:40,917 --> 00:11:42,999
at your college graduation.

233
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,166
It'sust not right, arvis.

234
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,957
It's not right.

235
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,041
Oh, no!

236
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,792
No, no, no.

237
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,374
My god, will!

238
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:55,500
Where are the kids?

239
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,792
Where are the kids!

240
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:04,124
Alrighty, kids.

241
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:08,666
This will be the best hike of your life.

242
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,124
Do you hear?

243
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,833
I'm telling you I know!

244
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:17,832
Oh, ned!

245
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:18,667
Is that right?

246
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:19,999
All right, kids.

247
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,874
We're gonna have the
best times of our lives,

248
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,166
and, and there's gonna be hiking,

249
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:28,500
and, and we're gonna find
all kinds of cuddly, uh.

250
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,916
We're going to find all
the kinds of cuddly and,

251
00:12:32,917 --> 00:12:35,417
try to find all kinds of, yeah, what?

252
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,957
No.

253
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,958
No.

254
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:41,583
No.

255
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:43,832
Ah, I know.

256
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,333
Do you hear what a, wait.

257
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:49,333
Um, okay, do you wanna keep rollin' or?

258
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:54,625
No!

259
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,207
You have to go for help.

260
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:39,791
I'll stay here and fight him off.

261
00:13:39,792 --> 00:13:43,332
No, you can't. He'll kill you.

262
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:44,832
It doesn't matter if I die,

263
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,666
as long as you live, my love.

264
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,917
Now go!

265
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,458
Scene.

266
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:57,791
So you do a lot of theater, do ya?

267
00:13:57,792 --> 00:13:58,792
Correct.

268
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:00,958
That was really good.

269
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,750
What? It was good.

270
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,041
Okay.

271
00:14:07,042 --> 00:14:08,750
Thanks for comin' in today.

272
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,291
Evan.

273
00:14:12,292 --> 00:14:14,042
You know, like even, but with an a.

274
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:18,666
Right. With an a.

275
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,499
Got it. Thanks.

276
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:24,874
And I'm Ivan, with an I.

277
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,708
So like Evan with an I.

278
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,582
Evan, Ivan, dude!

279
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:30,749
We're like brothers!

280
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,124
Sure.

281
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,124
So did I get the part?

282
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:37,000
I think... uh, yeah, uh, um.

283
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,042
We'll be in touch.

284
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,582
Rude.

285
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,124
What the heck was that for? Geez.

286
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,666
Oh, well, you can't
do that with everyone

287
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,624
who walks through the door.

288
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,583
He's not everyone.

289
00:14:51,584 --> 00:14:53,457
He's special, I'm telling you.

290
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:55,582
Yeah, with the a part.

291
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:56,500
What the hell is that part?

292
00:14:56,501 --> 00:14:58,417
- Yeah, yeah.
- A? Ivan?

293
00:15:06,542 --> 00:15:07,792
Even with an?

294
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:11,832
I don't know if wanna
be stuck with that guy.

295
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:12,833
Cool.

296
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:16,542
Wow. I gotta follow that?

297
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:20,166
Oh, hey! Hi, hi!

298
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,000
Uh, you made it.

299
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,125
Yes, I did.

300
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:27,875
Uh, hi.

301
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:29,749
My name's Lauren Moore,

302
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:33,000
and today I'm gonna
audition for the role of,

303
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:39,958
uh, Alice black, the lead
in the movie "slash camp,"

304
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:44,749
which great title, by the way.

305
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,374
Did you come up with it?

306
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:47,208
Yup.

307
00:15:47,209 --> 00:15:49,332
Yeah, that was me.

308
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,666
It's hot.

309
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,208
It's not. It's...

310
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:55,583
You know what?

311
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:58,708
Cool. Let's see you audition.

312
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:04,833
Oh.

313
00:16:06,417 --> 00:16:09,583
Um.

314
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:16,541
Can I ask you a question?

315
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:18,792
Of course, ned. What is it?

316
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,374
Well, don't be scared.

317
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,125
You can ask me anything.

318
00:16:31,667 --> 00:16:33,458
Do you like me?

319
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:35,917
Yes or no?

320
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,083
Oh.

321
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,958
Oh, ned!

322
00:16:48,167 --> 00:16:50,167
I can't answer this.

323
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:52,458
But why?

324
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,458
Because.

325
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:00,833
I don't have a pencil.

326
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,750
Cut.

327
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,666
Do you need me to do it again?

328
00:17:10,667 --> 00:17:13,542
Is there? Anything, anything you want.

329
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,417
No, no, that was, that was great.

330
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,624
We're making a fucking movie.

331
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,874
This is gonna be so fucking awesome.

332
00:17:43,417 --> 00:17:45,832
Hey, uh, can we get some more steam

333
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,458
on these entrails here?

334
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,374
All right, people.

335
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:54,457
Let's get some smoke on these guts!

336
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,332
Be my food!

337
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,333
Cut!

338
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,332
Hey, man. How's the movie comin'?

339
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:36,624
Oh, all right.

340
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,375
Good talk, good talk.

341
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,499
All right,
will. Where are the kids?

342
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,500
Where are?

343
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,832
Hi, Ivan. How's it goin'?

344
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,624
You get the movie done yet?

345
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:51,625
Come on.

346
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,207
Hey, yo, Ivan.

347
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:00,583
Is the movie ready yet?

348
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:10,624
What the fuck, bro?

349
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:11,999
Come on!

350
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,707
We've been waitin' all damn day.

351
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:14,708
Hurry up!

352
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,292
Oh, wait. Hey.

353
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:34,541
How's it goin'?

354
00:19:36,292 --> 00:19:37,292
Ivan.

355
00:19:40,668 --> 00:19:43,666
"Queen 3" is far
superior to "blood bank 2."

356
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:45,207
"Blood bank 2" is crap.

357
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,874
They didn't even bring back electra count,

358
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,791
the main vampire.

359
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:49,957
She owned that film.

360
00:19:49,958 --> 00:19:52,666
Heck, she is that franchise.

361
00:19:52,667 --> 00:19:56,291
Ugh, and Carmen Carlisle
freaking slayed in that role.

362
00:19:56,292 --> 00:19:57,457
Le-gend.

363
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,666
Okay, all right.

364
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,374
Look, I like the electra count character

365
00:20:01,375 --> 00:20:03,541
just as much as anyone else, totally.

366
00:20:03,542 --> 00:20:05,291
You gotta understand that they were trying

367
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,207
to do something new with the franchise.

368
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,666
They were trying to move the franchise

369
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,500
in a different direction.

370
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:12,624
Introduce some players
and create a whole new

371
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,082
cinematic universe.

372
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:15,332
Yeah, all right. I can see that.

373
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,582
But they still needed
to keep electra in it.

374
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:20,707
Even if it was a small
part, they could've used her

375
00:20:20,708 --> 00:20:22,374
to connect the horror universe.

376
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,207
And they corrected that in part three,

377
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:26,083
which is why it's superior.

378
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,083
Fine.

379
00:20:29,084 --> 00:20:31,957
All right, part three's slightly better.

380
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,207
I know it is.

381
00:20:38,708 --> 00:20:40,374
Lauren.

382
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:41,375
Jessica.

383
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,749
Lauren.

384
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,750
Josh.

385
00:20:46,042 --> 00:20:47,083
Uh, essica.

386
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:49,499
- Osh.
- Ess-

387
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,833
- Can you guys not?

388
00:20:54,625 --> 00:20:56,000
What's up, bro?

389
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:00,792
It's done.

390
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:03,791
Whoa, are you serious?

391
00:21:03,792 --> 00:21:07,416
- No fucking way.
- Oh my gosh!

392
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,791
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

393
00:21:10,792 --> 00:21:12,416
Listen.

394
00:21:12,417 --> 00:21:13,832
You gotta be quiet.

395
00:21:13,833 --> 00:21:14,667
I want quiet in here.

396
00:21:14,668 --> 00:21:17,583
No talking and everybody
can enjoy the video, ayit?

397
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,666
Oh, no.

398
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:31,249
And if you take a look around, kids,

399
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:34,000
you might be lucky enough
to find some poison Ivy.

400
00:21:35,042 --> 00:21:37,166
Or, oh, I know!

401
00:21:37,167 --> 00:21:40,125
Everybody's favorite
itchy bad guy: Poison oak!

402
00:21:44,167 --> 00:21:48,500
Bungalow bill, are you
eating all the hiking snacks?

403
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,332
Sorry. Sorry, camp wannabe warriors.

404
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,624
Looks like bungalow bill has
eaten all of our hiking snacks.

405
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,749
Kids?

406
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,374
My god, bill!

407
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:02,792
Where are the kids?

408
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,750
No!

409
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,291
Don't be scared.

410
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:19,292
You can ask me anything.

411
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,666
Do you like me?

412
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:35,333
Check yes or no.

413
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:42,667
Oh, ned!

414
00:22:44,917 --> 00:22:47,125
What? What is it? What's wrong?

415
00:22:50,542 --> 00:22:52,957
I can't answer this.

416
00:22:52,958 --> 00:22:54,292
What? Why not?

417
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:58,458
Because

418
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,291
I don't have a pencil.

419
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,333
No!

420
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:17,958
Run, bill!

421
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:24,917
Be my foods!

422
00:23:28,917 --> 00:23:30,416
Oh!

423
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:35,292
Bill!

424
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:52,541
Ned, he'll kill you!

425
00:23:52,542 --> 00:23:54,832
It doesn't matter if I die,

426
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:57,082
as long as you live, my love.

427
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:58,083
Now go!

428
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,124
Okay.

429
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Really?

430
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,333
Oh!

431
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,250
Oh!

432
00:24:27,542 --> 00:24:30,708
And the winner for the best actor is

433
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:32,832
Bob!

434
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:37,374
- Bob!
- Yeah!

435
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,625
- Oh, way to go, Bob!
- Woo!

436
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,750
Best actor ever!

437
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,000
Aw, this is crazy.

438
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,458
And our nominees are

439
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,417
"corpse love".

440
00:24:56,542 --> 00:24:58,000
"Dangerous mice."

441
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:01,332
"Slash camp."

442
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,500
And "Gore whore 3: Gore whore on wheels."

443
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:07,042
And the winner is

444
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,207
"slash camp"!

445
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,291
Oh!

446
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,250
Bob! Bob!

447
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:38,250
Where are you going?

448
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:39,999
You're going to the after party, right?

449
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,749
Uh, yeah.

450
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,333
Bob's got a limo!

451
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,292
Well, I can have a limo.

452
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:50,125
Really, you do?

453
00:25:52,833 --> 00:25:54,207
No.

454
00:25:57,792 --> 00:25:59,375
Bye.

455
00:26:30,958 --> 00:26:33,916
Oh, is that the one where
they kill animals for young,

456
00:26:33,917 --> 00:26:36,707
and the director was arrested
because they really thought

457
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:38,332
he killed people?

458
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:41,749
No, you're thinking of
"cannibal apocalypse."

459
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,666
Not the same film at all.

460
00:26:44,667 --> 00:26:47,499
"Hannibal dancer" has a
bit of a comedy flair to it

461
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,874
and stars Mary thore.

462
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,124
You know, follows a young cannibal dancer,

463
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:54,457
moves to Italy to pursue dance,

464
00:26:54,458 --> 00:26:56,583
but she ends up being chased.

465
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,541
Cool.

466
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:01,542
I know you.

467
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:05,291
Dammit, Holland.

468
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,166
So we're being chased,

469
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:12,167
and I say, "I doesn't matter if I die,

470
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:14,167
as long as you live, my love.

471
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:18,249
Now go."

472
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,083
That's it.

473
00:27:19,084 --> 00:27:20,499
My movie's completely original, right?

474
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,416
It's an '803 throwback slasher,

475
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:24,999
but with a twist.

476
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,791
Yeah, you actually don't
do so good at parties,

477
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,166
but it makes all the
difference when we win, yeah.

478
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:31,667
Check that out. I know, right?

479
00:27:35,417 --> 00:27:38,166
It's about a group of
teens who go into the woods,

480
00:27:38,167 --> 00:27:41,292
but there's this giant,
hulking killer in a mask.

481
00:27:42,542 --> 00:27:49,499
J“ rock star”

482
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:57,500
j“ style your heart out“

483
00:27:57,958 --> 00:28:01,957
j' blast off“

484
00:28:01,958 --> 00:28:05,499
j“ get lost'

485
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:12,832
style your heart out

486
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:14,874
that sounds phenomenal.

487
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:17,249
Please, tell me more.

488
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,207
Yeah, okay.

489
00:28:19,208 --> 00:28:21,582
Anyways, you'd be great in it.

490
00:28:21,583 --> 00:28:24,374
I mean, there's no pay, but hey,

491
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:26,624
the exposure would be great.

492
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:27,625
I mean, uh.

493
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,458

Yes, quite lovely.

00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,832
Wow! Uh, yeah!

519
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:41,832

558
00:31:28,292 --> 00:31:29,500
Can I keep this pen?

559
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,832
Of course.

560
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:33,833
And the contract, too. That's your copy.

561
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:38,417
So, now what?

562
00:31:39,792 --> 00:31:41,582
Enjoy the party.

563
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:44,291
Go. Be with your friends.

564
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,375
Arvid will send you the deliverables soon.

565
00:31:47,542 --> 00:31:48,708
Really? That's it?

566
00:31:50,333 --> 00:31:51,458
That's it, gentlemen.

567
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:55,166
Wow.

568
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,000
Wow, man!

569
00:31:56,001 --> 00:32:00,417
Uh, thank you, thank
you so much.

570
00:32:03,375 --> 00:32:04,749
Rampage media.

571
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:08,958
The largest distributor of
independent horror on the planet.

572
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,042
Yeah, yeah, you know it.

573
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:15,000
Thank you for coming. Goodbye.

574
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,417
Cool, I'm gonna take these.

575
00:32:32,125 --> 00:32:33,582
Youust ditched me?

576
00:32:33,583 --> 00:32:35,582
Why would youust leave like that?

577
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:37,292
We got fucking distribution!

578
00:32:39,292 --> 00:32:42,374
Yes!

579
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:43,624
Hey, hey, hey!

580
00:32:43,625 --> 00:32:44,625
Shh.

581
00:32:45,417 --> 00:32:47,083
We got distribution!

582
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:57,333
Free from sexual inhibitions

583
00:32:57,792 --> 00:33:01,874
j“ falling at my doorstep“

584
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:03,999
Unreal.

585
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,707
What's all this?

586
00:33:05,708 --> 00:33:07,791
Max rampage's mansion.

587
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:09,041
He lives in a freakin' mansion.

588
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:12,332
Big house, big cars, but he can't pay us.

589
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:13,333
I don't get it.

590
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,457
He can afford it, I guess.

591
00:33:15,458 --> 00:33:17,207
Yeah, 'cause he's busy fucking over

592
00:33:17,208 --> 00:33:19,125
any filmmakers and never paying them.

593
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,416
Oh, that's our money. Ours.

594
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,666
Who knows how many
filmmaker's lives he's ruined.

595
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,124
I mean, look at this shit.

596
00:33:27,125 --> 00:33:30,374
He has hundreds and hundreds
of films on his website.

597
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:32,624
What do you wanna bet he
hasn't paid any of 'em.

598
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:33,999
Yeah, it's fucked up, dude.

599
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,416
Exactly.

600
00:33:35,417 --> 00:33:37,582
We can't let him get away with this.

601
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:40,624
People need to get paid for their work.

602
00:33:40,625 --> 00:33:42,124
Marco.

603
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:43,624
He needs to get paid back or-

604
00:33:43,625 --> 00:33:44,625
- what?

605
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,916
Or nothin', nothin'.

606
00:33:47,917 --> 00:33:50,458
Weust gotta pay Marco back by next week.

607
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,083
Okay, what do you propose we do?

608
00:33:57,167 --> 00:33:58,707
We Rob his house, get our money.

609
00:33:58,708 --> 00:33:59,583
Fuck him!

610
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:00,500
Come on, man.

611
00:34:00,501 --> 00:34:02,666
We're not robbing anyone.

612
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:03,500
Well, listen, listen.

613
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:05,124
He fucked us.

614
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:07,125
He owes us money, right?

615
00:34:07,958 --> 00:34:09,791
Now I'm not talkin' about hurting anyone.

616
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,667
No, no, no.

617
00:34:10,668 --> 00:34:14,707
Just go down to his house,
demand that he pays us.

618
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:15,874
That's it.

619
00:34:15,875 --> 00:34:17,291
That's a bad move, dude.

620
00:34:17,292 --> 00:34:19,541
Oh my gosh, osh. You got a better one?

621
00:34:19,542 --> 00:34:21,666
'Cause if don't pay Marco
back by next week, he's gonna-

622
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,207
- What?

623
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,625
Wait, I don't have a dog.

624
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,041
- Cats.
- No.

625
00:34:27,042 --> 00:34:28,249
- Hamster.
- No.

626
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,625
- Goldfish.
- No.

627
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,583
- Your grandma then.
- No, no.

628
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:34,708
Nothin'.

629
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:36,292
No, bullshit. What, man?

630
00:34:39,293 --> 00:34:41,832
Okay, he's gonna shoot my grandma.

631
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:42,916
Yeah.

632
00:34:42,917 --> 00:34:45,582
I'll shoot your fuckin' grandma.

633
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,291
All right, there.

634
00:34:47,292 --> 00:34:49,750
If I don't pay him back,
my grandma's toast.

635
00:34:50,917 --> 00:34:52,917
No more grandma cookies.

636
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,249
You get me?

637
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,749
I'm sorry. What?

638
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,082
Okay, osh. He has a gun.

639
00:34:59,083 --> 00:35:00,666
If I don't pay him back by next week, pow!

640
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:01,957
Pow! Pow!

641
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:03,374
He's gonna shoot my grandma.

642
00:35:03,375 --> 00:35:07,416
No, I, I, I heard you, but what?

643
00:35:07,417 --> 00:35:08,666
I like my grandma, dude.

644
00:35:08,667 --> 00:35:09,500
Yeah.

645
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:12,124
She doesn't deserve any of this shit.

646
00:35:12,125 --> 00:35:13,166
She makes cookies, remember?

647
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:14,167
The little macaroons.

648
00:35:14,168 --> 00:35:15,332
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, I remember.

649
00:35:15,333 --> 00:35:16,957
They tasted like bingo halls smells.

650
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:19,999
That doesn't mean she
deserves to get shot, bro.

651
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,416
Yeah, yeah, I know.

652
00:35:21,417 --> 00:35:22,250
I'm not saying that.

653
00:35:22,251 --> 00:35:23,749
I love your grandma.

654
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:24,583
Most people's grandmas are great.

655
00:35:24,584 --> 00:35:26,166
I'must saying what kind of sick mind

656
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,832
operates like that?

657
00:35:27,833 --> 00:35:31,249
Josh, that's why we gotta
do something, all right?

658
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,624
We'llust go down to his house,

659
00:35:33,625 --> 00:35:37,291
demand that he pays us, that's it.

660
00:35:37,292 --> 00:35:39,832
And if he doesn't, then we'll, we'll,

661
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:41,957
we'll steal his fucking TV.

662
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:42,958
Yeah, yeah.

663
00:35:47,125 --> 00:35:48,125
All right.

664
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:51,541
Let's say we do that.

665
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,499
Not, not the stealing the TV part,

666
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:56,125
but the asking for our money part.

667
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,333
Do you have a plan?

668
00:35:59,334 --> 00:36:01,374
Josh, osh, osh.

669
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:03,583
All I've got are plans.

670
00:36:08,375 --> 00:36:13,375
Ugh.

671
00:36:20,208 --> 00:36:23,416
Hey.

672
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:24,417
Hey.

673
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,042
What's up?

674
00:36:29,043 --> 00:36:30,291
Wanna help us Rob a mansion?

675
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:33,500
Not exactly how I was gonna
start that conversation, but.

676
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:37,416
Um, okay.

677
00:36:37,417 --> 00:36:39,458
How were you gonna start it then?

678
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:42,875
Like this.

679
00:36:47,208 --> 00:36:49,375
All right. Sorry.

680
00:36:52,208 --> 00:36:54,041
So you're gonna Rob a mansion?

681
00:36:54,042 --> 00:36:56,416
- No.
- Yes.

682
00:36:56,417 --> 00:36:57,666
No.

683
00:36:57,667 --> 00:37:00,375
Look, first and foremost,

684
00:37:01,292 --> 00:37:02,666
you deserve to get paid.

685
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:04,957
Yeah, ya think?

686
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:06,166
Movie's out, it's a big hit.

687
00:37:06,167 --> 00:37:09,582
Everybody says so, but here I am back in

688
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,082
the game store working for minimum wage,

689
00:37:11,083 --> 00:37:13,124
dealing with nerds whoust wanna stare

690
00:37:13,125 --> 00:37:14,666
at my tits all day.

691
00:37:14,667 --> 00:37:17,082
Yeah, I deserve to get paid.

692
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,957
Oh, andosh, fuck you for not calling me!

693
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:23,249
In my defense, I was really embarrassed.

694
00:37:23,250 --> 00:37:25,125
Oh? Louder.

695
00:37:28,125 --> 00:37:29,874
Look, I screwed up, okay?

696
00:37:29,875 --> 00:37:31,957
We trusted that distributor
and he hasn't paid us

697
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,874
a single fucking dime.

698
00:37:33,875 --> 00:37:35,916
You haven't gotten paid like at all?

699
00:37:35,917 --> 00:37:37,499
Nothing.

700
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,624
Everyone thinks
you'reust ducking them

701
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,457
and keeping the money for yourselves.

702
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,916
That's great, 'cause we're not.

703
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,332
There's no money, I swear.

704
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,874
It's true. We got hosed.

705
00:37:45,875 --> 00:37:49,791
Okay, okay, well, let's say that's true.

706
00:37:49,792 --> 00:37:51,166
What are you even gonna do about it then?

707
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:52,000
Rob that fucker.

708
00:37:52,001 --> 00:37:53,832
We're not robbing anybody.

709
00:37:53,833 --> 00:37:55,874
We'reust going to go to his house.

710
00:37:55,875 --> 00:37:58,833
We're gonna demand that he
gives us our money, politely.

711
00:37:59,708 --> 00:38:00,542
That's it.

712
00:38:00,543 --> 00:38:03,083
And you're telling me because?

713
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,499
Come on, you know.

714
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
You're my, my girlfriend.

715
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,750
Or you were. I don't know.

716
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,749
I'm sorry. We fucked up.

717
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,124
We kind of fell in love with the dream.

718
00:38:18,125 --> 00:38:20,124
You know, I thought that we
were gonna be like famous

719
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:23,124
and living in Hollywood
and now I'm sleeping alone

720
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:27,082
on a futon, delivering
pizzas, and it sucks.

721
00:38:27,083 --> 00:38:28,208
And I'm sorry, okay?

722
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:30,957
And if I don't start paying
back my student loans-

723
00:38:30,958 --> 00:38:33,416
- for what it's worth, I'm sorry, too.

724
00:38:33,417 --> 00:38:34,417
Look, you were great in the movie.

725
00:38:34,418 --> 00:38:35,499
Fantastic.

726
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,082
But we're out of options.

727
00:38:37,083 --> 00:38:38,083
We got a plan.

728
00:38:39,792 --> 00:38:41,708
Jessica and Bob are in. Evan, too.

729
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,749
We are getting the gang back together,

730
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,957
but Lauren, we need your help.

731
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:48,958
Robbing a mansion?

732
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:50,125
- Yes.
- No.

733
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,125
Look.

734
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:57,166
Jessica, Bob and Evan are in?

735
00:38:57,167 --> 00:38:58,167
Yeah.

736
00:39:02,417 --> 00:39:03,749
Okay, fine. Whatever.

737
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,082
I'm in.

738
00:39:05,083 --> 00:39:06,457
Really?

739

I gotta keep an eye on
my investment, you know?

761
00:41:05,958 --> 00:41:07,124
I gotta piss, dude.

762

Oh, great. Me, too.

Lots of piss. Let's piss together.

00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:13,708
Yeah.

766
00:41:25,667 --> 00:41:27,291
You want anything?

767
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:29,957
Uh, my tummy kinda hurts.

769
00:41:39,042 --> 00:41:40,042

00:41:41,417 --> 00:41:42,417
Yes.

771
00:41:43,208 --> 00:41:45,916
Are you, are you sure about this, osh?

772
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:48,416
Yeah. No. I don't know.

773
00:41:48,417 --> 00:41:49,250
Who's this Marco guy?

774
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:51,124
How do you guys know him?

775
00:41:51,125 --> 00:41:52,291
Oh, I don't know him.

776
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:53,292
He's Ivan's friend.

777
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:54,292
He gave us some money.

778
00:41:54,293 --> 00:41:55,541
I think he wants it back now.

779
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:57,666
He has a gun in hisacket.

780
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,082
I saw it.

781
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,707
I know, I know.

782
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:01,708

785
00:42:05,292 --> 00:42:06,833
What does our friendosh know?

786
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:10,749
Nothin'.

787
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,750
What is it?

788
00:42:13,208 --> 00:42:16,791
What does our friend
Josh the filmmaker know?

789
00:42:16,792 --> 00:42:18,291
I'm dying to hear.

790
00:42:18,292 --> 00:42:19,457
Do I look like I know something?

791
00:42:19,458 --> 00:42:22,582
I don't know. I don't know nothin'.

792
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,916
Here's that.

793
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:25,707
Must be somethin', no?

794
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:26,708
Hang on.

795
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:31,666
Surely a smart guy
like Ivan's friendosh

796
00:42:31,667 --> 00:42:32,667
knows somethin'.

797
00:42:34,417 --> 00:42:35,417
Tell me!

798
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,042
Your card declined.

799
00:42:39,917 --> 00:42:40,750
What?

800
00:42:40,751 --> 00:42:42,125
Your card declined.

801
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,291
Yeah, uh, that makes sense.

802
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:46,749
Um, okay.

803
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,832
I got, I got like nine bucks, so.

804
00:42:50,833 --> 00:42:51,833
I got you, man.

805
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:54,125
We're friends, right?

806
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:56,250
You can pay me back later.

807
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:00,250
Thanks.

808
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:02,750
All right.

809
00:43:02,751 --> 00:43:04,624
I'm talking about story.

810
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:07,416
The way Dracula's
portrayed in the original.

811
00:43:07,417 --> 00:43:10,332
John comet killed it, literally.

812
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:12,541
Classic, yes, I agree,

813
00:43:12,542 --> 00:43:15,291
but I think that Sean Becker
in the remake isust,

814
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:18,582
I mean, oh god, he is
Dracula in that movie.

815
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:19,749
He carries the entire film.

816
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,666
Friendosh.

817
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:22,874
Yeah?

818
00:43:22,875 --> 00:43:24,166
If you do not stop talking,

819
00:43:24,167 --> 00:43:26,124
do you know what I'll do?

820
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,791
Shoot my grandma?

821
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,875
And bingo was his name-o.

822
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:32,083
Maybe some music, huh?

823
00:43:34,375 --> 00:43:37,624
J' he's comin' for me“

824
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:39,416
killer clown

825
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:43,249
comin' to kill me

826
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:44,291
killer clown

827
00:43:44,292 --> 00:43:45,874
Ain't that's it?

828
00:43:45,875 --> 00:43:48,041
Should be. Yeah, think so.

829
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,916
And this guy, this Maxim,

830
00:43:50,917 --> 00:43:52,249
he owes you money?

831
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,250
Yes.

832
00:43:54,167 --> 00:43:55,917
Then he owes me money, too.

833
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,957
What?

834
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:01,374
Well, we kind of have a plan,

835
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:03,167
and I worked really hard on it.

836
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,542
I have a plan, too.

837
00:44:05,542 --> 00:44:06,542
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

838
00:44:06,543 --> 00:44:07,791
And it goes like this.

839
00:44:07,792 --> 00:44:09,832
Get out of the fucking car!

840
00:44:16,125 --> 00:44:17,707
See?

841
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,374
Better. My plan is good.

842
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,417
More direct.

843
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,541
But I worked really hard on the plan.

844
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:25,957
I made little maps and everything.

845
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:28,291
Maybe you should've tried harder.

846
00:44:28,292 --> 00:44:30,624
Maybe you should've done lots of things.

847
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,416
Maybe you should've paid me back,

848
00:44:32,417 --> 00:44:33,666
othennise we wouldn't be here.

849
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:34,583
Hey, look, man.

850
00:44:34,584 --> 00:44:37,207
I don't think it's very fair to, ah-ah!

851
00:44:37,208 --> 00:44:39,457
What? You don't like my plan?

852
00:44:39,458 --> 00:44:40,458
Well?

853
00:44:40,459 --> 00:44:43,416
What, you don't want to get shot?

854
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:44,583
Wha? Uh! Uh!

855
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:46,916
What?

856
00:44:46,917 --> 00:44:47,917
Well, don't ya?

857
00:44:47,918 --> 00:44:49,542
We, weust want our money.

858
00:44:52,708 --> 00:44:53,916
That's good.

859
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:55,042
We're on the same team.

860
00:44:56,417 --> 00:44:58,792
We, uh, what are you doing?

861
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,542
Texting my dad.

862
00:45:02,417 --> 00:45:03,583
Phones, now.

863
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:05,583
Come on, all of ya!

864
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:07,041
Don't make me shoot your dog!

865
00:45:07,042 --> 00:45:08,916
What is it with you and shootin' dogs?

866
00:45:08,917 --> 00:45:10,957
I saw it in a movie once, all right?

867
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:11,875
It works.

868
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:15,707
People love their dogs
more than their family.

869
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:18,166
Sometimes, I think.

870
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:19,832
So you shoot dog.

871
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:24,166
But, um, notohn wick's dog.

872
00:45:24,167 --> 00:45:30,666
That's, uh, that's bad.

873
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:32,500
Anyway, doesn't matter.

874
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:49,124
All right, good, good.

875
00:45:49,125 --> 00:45:51,666
We're the same team.

876
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:53,082
Good, good.

877
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,624
Uh, come on.

878
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:58,749
Let's go and say hello to
our new friend, shall we?

879
00:45:58,750 --> 00:45:59,750
Ah, ah.

880
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:22,082
Don't fuck me about.

881
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,500
This better be the place.

882
00:46:24,458 --> 00:46:27,042
Yeah, that's what
it said on the Internet.

883
00:46:51,458 --> 00:46:52,458
Knock.

884
00:46:53,458 --> 00:46:55,541
You, little girl who talks to much.

885
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:56,542
Knock on the door.

886
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,208
Well, hello, Santa.

887
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,625
Are these your little elves?

888
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,416
This is most interesting.

889
00:47:26,417 --> 00:47:28,916
We weren't expecting guests,

890
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:31,499
and you brought your actress friends, too.

891
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,457
You have great taste.

892
00:47:33,458 --> 00:47:34,542
They look yummy.

893
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,957
Excuse me, I'm not some floozy actress.

894
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:39,875
I'm a pa.

895
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:42,124
Um, excuse me.

896
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,291
Just saying.

897
00:47:43,292 --> 00:47:44,125
You guys, stop!

898
00:47:44,126 --> 00:47:46,582
Okay, well then. Here we are.

899
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:49,957
Santa and his bitchy elves.

900
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:51,292
What can I do for you?

901
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:56,541
Oh, we'd like our money, please.

902
00:47:56,542 --> 00:47:58,416
Your money?

903
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:01,416
You owe us money from
the sales of our film,

904
00:48:01,417 --> 00:48:03,291
and we need it, please.

905
00:48:03,292 --> 00:48:06,582
Your money? You want your money?

906
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:09,916
That's why you came here,
tonight of all nights?

907
00:48:09,917 --> 00:48:12,249
Did he fucking stutter?

908
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:14,749
You owe us money, our money.

909
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:17,000
$20,000.

910
00:48:17,917 --> 00:48:19,375
Oh, I see.

911
00:48:21,042 --> 00:48:22,458
- Good.
- No.

912
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:26,875
What did you say to me?

913
00:48:28,542 --> 00:48:31,125
I said quite clearly, no.

914
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:33,624
You don't get to come here making demands.

915
00:48:33,625 --> 00:48:35,042
That's not how this works.

916
00:48:38,417 --> 00:48:39,666
What are you doing?

917
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,666
Looking for your dog.

918
00:48:41,667 --> 00:48:43,207
Odd.

919
00:48:43,208 --> 00:48:45,374
Gonna fuckin' shoot him.

920
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:46,500
Odder still.

921
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:50,333
We don't have a dog.

922
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:55,457
You have to help us. He has a gun.

923
00:48:55,458 --> 00:48:56,458
I know.

924
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:59,417
Must be very frightening, I'm sure.

925
00:49:00,917 --> 00:49:03,124
He seems quite unhinged.

926
00:49:03,125 --> 00:49:04,457
Perhaps you should put him in a movie.

927
00:49:04,458 --> 00:49:05,750
He's quite the character.

928
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,583
Perhaps you should come in, please.

929
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,125
What is his name?

930
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,207
Marco something-or-another.

931
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:28,916
- Marco.
- Polo.

932
00:49:28,917 --> 00:49:30,082
You did not.

933
00:49:30,083 --> 00:49:31,832
We don't have a dog.

934
00:49:31,833 --> 00:49:32,999
Any pets?

935
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,916
No, I'm afraid not.

936
00:49:34,917 --> 00:49:36,125
Have you got a grandma?

937
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:39,249
Well, yes, grandma's here, but.

938
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:40,374
I'm gonna fuckin' shoot her.

939
00:49:40,375 --> 00:49:42,707
You can't shoot her, I'm sorry.

940
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:44,416
We're quite fond of her.

941
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:47,707
Please, do come in.

942
00:49:47,708 --> 00:49:49,417
We'reust sitting down to dinner.

943
00:49:53,125 --> 00:49:55,332
Really, do come in.

944
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:57,417
Let's get to the bottom of this, shall we?

945
00:50:01,333 --> 00:50:02,583
Come, let's settle this.

946
00:50:23,958 --> 00:50:24,958
Ho-ho-ho!

947
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:28,667
Dude, don't do the thing.

948
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:35,291
Max rampage. Rampage media.

949
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:40,125
The largest distributor of
independent horror on the planet!

950
00:50:41,292 --> 00:50:42,667
Yes, you did.

951
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:46,125
Yeah, yeah, we've met before.

952
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,208
At the hotel.

953
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:55,582
The video screen film festival?

954
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,707
You gave us distribution.

955
00:50:57,708 --> 00:50:59,417
For yourfilm.

956
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:01,624
Yeah.

957
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:02,832
Excellent!

958
00:51:02,833 --> 00:51:05,291
We are the largest distributor

959
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:09,041
of independent horror on the planet!

960
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,250
Right.

961
00:51:16,125 --> 00:51:20,458
I'm sorry, but, um, what
the fuck is going on here?

962
00:51:21,375 --> 00:51:23,292
That's a very good question.

963
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:27,874
You come to our home on
Christmas Eve, nonetheless,

964
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:30,208
just as we're preparing our evening meal,

965
00:51:31,125 --> 00:51:32,708
with hobo Santa.

966
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,166
So you tell me, child.

967
00:51:35,167 --> 00:51:36,708
What exactly is going on here?

968
00:51:37,750 --> 00:51:39,749
Go on. We're all listening.

969
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42,582
Well, I didn't bring. I mean...

970
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:44,999
What is going on, Victoria?

971
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,920
Nothing,
grandma. Everything's fine.

972
00:51:47,708 --> 00:51:49,416
Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

973
00:51:49,417 --> 00:51:51,499
It's grandma time!

974
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,916
Goodbye, gran!

975
00:51:56,458 --> 00:51:58,291
Ah! Oh my god!

976
00:51:58,292 --> 00:51:59,457
Ah!

977
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:00,625
Ah! Oh my god!

978
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:03,124
Oh, geez!

979
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,208
Oh! Ah! Ah!

980
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:08,707
Ah! Oh, god. Oh, fuck!

981
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,875
She bit him!

982
00:52:14,167 --> 00:52:15,250
What is this?

983
00:52:16,875 --> 00:52:19,207
He shot you, grandma.

984
00:52:19,208 --> 00:52:21,958
That little cocksucker shot me?

985
00:52:22,875 --> 00:52:23,750
Yes, he shot you.

986
00:52:23,751 --> 00:52:25,875
What do you suggest we do about it?

987
00:52:27,167 --> 00:52:29,667
Let's tie 'em up

988
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,457
and rip their intestines

989
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:35,957
out through their assholes

990
00:52:35,958 --> 00:52:40,416
and hang them like
garlands around the house,

991
00:52:40,417 --> 00:52:43,208
and bathe in their blood,

992
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:48,166
and dance naked to the sounds

993
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,250
of their screams!

994
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:56,166
Just like in the old days.

995
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,541
That seems completely reasonable.

996
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:02,499
Arvid, love, would you be so
kind as to call the children?

997
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:03,833
Yes, my queen.

998
00:53:06,708 --> 00:53:09,208
Dog whistle in the key of bauhaus.

999
00:53:10,417 --> 00:53:12,082
You said you didn't have a dog.

1000
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,749
We don't.

1001
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:14,916
What?

1002
00:53:14,917 --> 00:53:16,291
Doesn't call dogs.

1003
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:18,541
It calls the gods, dear.

1004
00:53:18,542 --> 00:53:22,291
Out from their shallow
lairs and underground clubs,

1005
00:53:22,292 --> 00:53:25,374
out of their basements and
away from their video games,

1006
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:28,333
they come, marching to
a gothic dance beat.

1007
00:53:29,792 --> 00:53:30,792
Pleaseust shut up!

1008
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,333
You don't like goth music?

1009
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:37,458
Nobody really likes gothic music.

1010
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:41,375
Well, you're an offensive
little toad, aren't you?

1011
00:53:42,458 --> 00:53:45,082
First you barge in here uninvited,

1012
00:53:45,083 --> 00:53:46,541
then you shoot grandma,

1013
00:53:46,542 --> 00:53:51,042
and now you have the nerve to
criticize my taste in music?

1014
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:54,249
Lust can't with you.

1015
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:55,250
Nina?

1016
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,541
Oof.

1017
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,832
Yum, yum, yum!

1018
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:05,958
What the fuck?

1019
00:54:06,833 --> 00:54:09,666
Yum, yum, yum!

1020
00:54:09,667 --> 00:54:10,667
Yum, yum!

1021
00:54:38,125 --> 00:54:40,416
Are you kidding me right now?

1022
00:54:40,417 --> 00:54:42,041
You're vampires?

1023
00:54:42,042 --> 00:54:43,792
Like actual freaking vampires?

1024
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:51,666
Really?

1025
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:54,124
This is so cool! On my gosh!

1026
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,416
I have like a hundred questions!

1027
00:54:56,417 --> 00:54:58,624
Um, first one.

1028
00:54:58,625 --> 00:54:59,833
How do you guys... run!

1029
00:55:24,625 --> 00:55:25,625
Goths.

1030
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,124
We've gotta get to the car.

1031
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:29,125
Back door!

1032
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:43,249
Let them run, get their blood pumping.

1033
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:44,667
But don't let them escape.

1034
00:55:46,792 --> 00:55:48,249
Max.

1035
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:51,582
Max rampage. Rampage media.

1036
00:55:51,583 --> 00:55:56,583
The largest distributor of
independent horror on the planet!

1037
00:55:56,792 --> 00:55:59,957
Max dear, I want you to go with arvid.

1038
00:55:59,958 --> 00:56:02,499
Chase them, scare them.

1039
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:05,041
I like my dinner served hot and messy.

1040
00:56:05,042 --> 00:56:08,166
Adrenaline is the spice
of life, after all.

1041
00:56:08,167 --> 00:56:09,416
Do you understand?

1042
00:56:09,417 --> 00:56:13,707
We are the largest distributor
of independent horror

1043
00:56:13,708 --> 00:56:15,249
on the planet!

1044
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,541
Yes, I know.

1045
00:56:16,542 --> 00:56:18,082
So go distribute some horror.

1046
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,541
Can you do that for me?

1047
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,708
- I can.
- Okay.

1048
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,625
We're surrounded.

1049
00:56:33,626 --> 00:56:35,582
Oh, shit! There's so many of 'em.

1050
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,874
We'll never make it!

1051
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:37,875
Josh?

1052
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:41,457
I never loved you.

1053
00:56:41,458 --> 00:56:43,582
Lust wanted to be in your movie.

1054
00:56:43,583 --> 00:56:46,125
And honestly, it wasn't even that good.

1055
00:56:48,333 --> 00:56:49,917
The movie or the sex?

1056
00:56:51,042 --> 00:56:51,958
Both.

1057
00:56:51,959 --> 00:56:54,124
Oh, ouch.

1058
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,125
Arvid?

1059
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:58,874
I'd like you to lead the hunt.

1060
00:56:58,875 --> 00:57:01,374
Chase them, torment them.

1061
00:57:01,375 --> 00:57:03,874
You can take Max with you or lose him.

1062
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,541
I don't really care anymore.

1063
00:57:05,542 --> 00:57:07,666
Just keep an eye on the time.

1064
00:57:07,667 --> 00:57:11,457
I will rip the meat from their bones.

1065
00:57:11,458 --> 00:57:12,458
Lovely.

1066
00:57:14,167 --> 00:57:16,999
Torson, I'd like you to
make sure they don't get

1067
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,833
past the children, okay?

1068
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,792
Nina, you're with me. Let's have some fun.

1069
00:57:22,958 --> 00:57:24,749
And grandma?

1070
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:26,583
Oh, right, yeah. Grandma?

1071
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:29,041
What?

1072
00:57:29,042 --> 00:57:30,249
What's going on?

1073
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,416
We're hunting now, grandma.

1074
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:33,916
Hunting who?

1075
00:57:33,917 --> 00:57:35,333
The interlopers.

1076
00:57:36,625 --> 00:57:37,625
Where are they?

1077
00:57:37,626 --> 00:57:40,041
They're in the house.

1078
00:57:40,042 --> 00:57:41,582
Do you want to hunt them?

1079
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,083
Yes!

1080
00:57:44,542 --> 00:57:46,874
Now? You wanna do this now?

1081
00:57:46,875 --> 00:57:47,708
Like right now?

1082
00:57:47,709 --> 00:57:49,666
Like right now you wanna do this?

1083
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:51,375
Nope, that's it. Bye.

1084
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:53,417
Wait.

1085
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:55,541
You have to go get help.

1086
00:57:55,542 --> 00:57:56,542
I'll fight 'em off.

1087
00:57:57,667 --> 00:57:58,916
They'll kill you, Evan.

1088
00:57:58,917 --> 00:58:00,874
This is not some stupid movie.

1089
00:58:00,875 --> 00:58:04,249
Doesn't matter if I die,
as long as you live, my love.

1090
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:05,250
Now go!

1091
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:07,667
Whatever.

1092
00:58:10,667 --> 00:58:11,832
Huh?

1093
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,457
Are you serious right now?

1094
00:58:13,458 --> 00:58:16,041
That was some of the worst
acting I've ever seen!

1095
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:17,707
Hers or mine?

1096
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:19,791
- Yours.
- Both.

1097
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:21,458
Okay, do you need a hand?

1098
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:24,374
I'm old,

1099
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,500
you scraggly, little cock monkey!

1100
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,500
I'm not.

1101
00:58:30,708 --> 00:58:32,874
I'm not, what's that word?

1102
00:58:32,875 --> 00:58:34,416
- Incompetent?
- Irate.

1103
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:36,874
- Irregular.
- Irascible.

1104
00:58:36,875 --> 00:58:39,249
Incapable!

1105
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:40,250
That's the word.

1106
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,000
I'm not incapable.

1107
00:58:45,042 --> 00:58:50,042
I'm gonna rip their assholes
through their mouths.

1108
00:58:50,375 --> 00:58:53,124
That sounds truly unpleasant.

1109
00:58:53,125 --> 00:58:55,291
I like it. Can I borrow it?

1110
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:56,458
Borrow this!

1111
00:59:00,167 --> 00:59:02,667
I think that is physically impossible.

1112
00:59:03,833 --> 00:59:05,999
Grandma's very creative.

1113
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,582
Well, she has been at this
for more than 5,000 years.

1114
00:59:09,583 --> 00:59:12,499
If anyone can make it happen, she can.

1115
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,916
Okay, well, we can
discuss the possibility

1116
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:18,249
of ripping someone's asshole
through their mouth later.

1117
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:20,083
Off you go, grandma. Have fun.

1118
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:46,249
Fine. Fuck you, then.

1119
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,250
Wait for me!

1120
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:52,207
Evan!

1121
00:59:52,208 --> 00:59:54,625
You can'tust leave me here!

1122
00:59:56,500 --> 00:59:57,500
Oh!

1123
01:00:17,792 --> 01:00:19,874
No! osh! osh!

1124
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:20,875
Stop.

1125
01:00:22,292 --> 01:00:24,541
Close the door! Lock it!

1126
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,749
Where are the vampires?

1127
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,250
Why haven't they attacked yet?

1128
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:38,374
They're gone.

1129
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:39,375
Where?

1130
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,082
Keep watch.

1131
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:43,624
This isn't happening.

1132
01:00:43,625 --> 01:00:46,374
I mean, this isn't happening.

1133
01:00:46,375 --> 01:00:47,375
Oh, it's happening.

1134
01:00:47,376 --> 01:00:49,125
And it's freaking awesome!

1135
01:00:50,833 --> 01:00:52,541
What is wrong with you?

1136
01:00:52,542 --> 01:00:54,041
Dude, so many things.

1137
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:55,250
You don't even know.

1138
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:58,791
Oh!

1139
01:00:58,792 --> 01:01:00,582
Fuck! I should've stopped her, man!

1140
01:01:00,583 --> 01:01:02,249
I should've fucking stopped
her because I really loved her.

1141
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:03,666
I, mmm!

1142
01:01:03,667 --> 01:01:04,667
- You good?
- Yeah.

1143
01:01:06,250 --> 01:01:07,624
We have to get out of here.

1144
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:08,749
We need a plan.

1145
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,582
Well, I had a plan, but Marco-

1146
01:01:10,583 --> 01:01:12,249
- shut up!

1147
01:01:12,250 --> 01:01:14,292
Bob. With us?

1148
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,791
Listen, we can't go outside
because of the goths.

1149
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:20,916
We can't stay inside
because of the vampires.

1150
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:22,750
So we have to fight.

1151
01:01:23,958 --> 01:01:24,958
Can we?

1152
01:01:26,375 --> 01:01:28,541
"Night of the blood freaks," 1984.

1153
01:01:28,542 --> 01:01:30,957
Oh, yeah. "Blood freaks," '84.

1154
01:01:30,958 --> 01:01:33,166
When family pets begin to go missing,

1155
01:01:33,167 --> 01:01:34,874
a group of plucky teenagers suspect

1156
01:01:34,875 --> 01:01:37,124
that their neighbors might be a vampire,

1157
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:38,999
and they set out to
destroy him before he works

1158
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:40,416
his way up to human prey.

1159
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:43,041
It's got the vhs box cover art
with the light up green eyes.

1160
01:01:43,042 --> 01:01:44,374
Such a great film, man.

1161
01:01:44,375 --> 01:01:45,666
I don't know if I'd call it great.

1162
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:46,947
You know, no "blood haunt," but.

1163
01:01:47,917 --> 01:01:48,750
Oh, yeah. "Blood haunt."

1164
01:01:48,751 --> 01:01:52,374
Three vampires in a carnival
house with, uh, Marilyn carp?

1165
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:53,457
It was Marilyn blanks.

1166
01:01:53,458 --> 01:01:55,207
You're thinking of "funhouse from hell."

1167
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:57,041
But that doesn't matter.

1168
01:01:57,042 --> 01:01:58,332
What happens in "blood freaks"?

1169
01:01:58,333 --> 01:02:00,082
Uh, they fight.

1170
01:02:00,083 --> 01:02:01,332
And?

1171
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,791
They, uh, they win.

1172
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:05,791
- Say it again.
- They win.

1173
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:07,791
That's right. They win.

1174
01:02:07,792 --> 01:02:09,125
We have to do this.

1175
01:02:10,458 --> 01:02:11,458
Okay.

1176
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:16,207
Now, who knows about
vampires better than you?

1177
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:17,874
Besides obviously me.

1178
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:18,708
Uh, nobody.

1179
01:02:18,709 --> 01:02:21,166
I've seen every vampire
film, foreign and domestic.

1180
01:02:21,167 --> 01:02:22,000
Exactly.

1181
01:02:22,001 --> 01:02:25,082
You've been preparing for
this moment your entire life!

1182
01:02:25,083 --> 01:02:26,249
Yeah.

1183
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:27,208
Yeah.

1184
01:02:27,209 --> 01:02:28,291
Yeah, you're right.

1185
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:30,624
Yeah, fuck Lauren, man!

1186
01:02:30,625 --> 01:02:32,582
She's dead. Gross.

1187
01:02:32,583 --> 01:02:33,500
But okay, fuck Lauren.

1188
01:02:33,501 --> 01:02:36,041
Well, I mean, I didn't
literally mean fuck Lauren.

1189
01:02:36,042 --> 01:02:38,707
But I did. I did fuck Lauren.

1190
01:02:38,708 --> 01:02:40,707
I know what you mean, osh.

1191
01:02:40,708 --> 01:02:42,291
- Right.
- Right.

1192
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:45,291
Uh, guys? Grandma's coming!

1193
01:02:48,417 --> 01:02:49,707
Yum!

1194
01:02:49,708 --> 01:02:51,207
Yum!

1195
01:02:51,208 --> 01:02:55,249
Yum, yum, yum, yum!

1196
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,832
We need a plan now!

1197
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:58,291
Uh, uh!

1198
01:02:58,292 --> 01:03:00,083
Oh, quick! Run upstairs!

1199
01:03:01,167 --> 01:03:02,499
I'must, I'moking.

1200
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,541
I'm not that stupid.

1201
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:05,457
But we should probably split up.

1202
01:03:05,458 --> 01:03:06,458
Yeah.

1203
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:15,917
Yummy, yummy, yum, yum.

1204
01:03:21,792 --> 01:03:22,874
Oh, essica!

1205
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:24,291
Remember that you're a girl,

1206
01:03:24,292 --> 01:03:25,457
so don't like trip or fall down

1207
01:03:25,458 --> 01:03:26,916
or do something stupid like that, okay?

1208
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:28,125
- Got it.
- Yeah.

1209
01:03:41,750 --> 01:03:43,082
There.

1210
01:03:43,083 --> 01:03:47,082
I'll go find the others
and deal with grandma.

1211
01:03:47,083 --> 01:03:48,750
You know what to do.

1212
01:03:50,125 --> 01:03:51,125
Ho-ho-ho!

1213
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:06,958
Grandma?

1214
01:04:22,125 --> 01:04:23,125
Grandma?

1215
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:31,875
Grandma?

1216
01:04:56,042 --> 01:04:57,042
Gramps?

1217
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:07,832
Max rampage! Rampage media!

1218
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:12,042
The largest distributor of
independent horror on the planet!

1219
01:05:17,292 --> 01:05:19,708
Max seems to be degenerating.

1220
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,791
Yes, well, he's
never been the brightest

1221
01:05:22,792 --> 01:05:24,791
screw in the drawer, but he
does seem to be slipping a bit.

1222
01:05:24,792 --> 01:05:25,792
Yes.

1223
01:05:26,583 --> 01:05:27,583
It happens sometimes.

1224
01:05:28,667 --> 01:05:30,417
Eternity breaks them.

1225
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:34,582
He didn't even make a
decent Santa this year.

1226
01:05:34,583 --> 01:05:36,249
Or the year before that.

1227
01:05:36,250 --> 01:05:37,750
Or the year before that.

1228
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:39,833
Or the year before that.

1229
01:05:41,167 --> 01:05:42,000
You're right.

1230
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:44,082
This has been going on too long.

1231
01:05:44,083 --> 01:05:45,833
Perhaps it's time to replace him.

1232
01:05:49,208 --> 01:05:50,208
Perhaps.

1233
01:05:51,792 --> 01:05:54,417
I could have legal
draw up a new company.

1234
01:05:58,083 --> 01:06:00,332
Bankrupt rampage media.

1235
01:06:00,333 --> 01:06:01,417
Find fresh blood.

1236
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:04,499
That's a good idea.

1237
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,916
Men are so unreliable.

1238
01:06:06,917 --> 01:06:09,583
Truer words have never
been spoken, my queen.

1239
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:12,333
Okay.

1240
01:06:13,542 --> 01:06:14,708
Max goes.

1241
01:06:16,375 --> 01:06:18,625
Arvid and torson, too. They bore me.

1242
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:22,541
A clean house is a pretty house.

1243
01:06:22,542 --> 01:06:24,250
And, um, grandma?

1244
01:06:25,667 --> 01:06:28,791
She's family.

1245
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:29,792
Understood.

1246
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:32,874
Bring me one of the girls, though.

1247
01:06:32,875 --> 01:06:34,624
I have an idea.

1248
01:06:34,625 --> 01:06:35,958
As you command, my queen.

1249
01:07:31,833 --> 01:07:32,833
Hey.

1250
01:07:33,708 --> 01:07:35,457
What are you doing?

1251
01:07:35,458 --> 01:07:37,042
She's chasing me.

1252
01:07:37,917 --> 01:07:39,082
All right.

1253
01:07:39,083 --> 01:07:41,917
Don't you think you should get up?

1254
01:07:43,250 --> 01:07:44,624
Duh, I knew that.

1255
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:47,416
Just tripped and started crawling.

1256
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:48,916
Mmmhmm.

1257
01:07:48,917 --> 01:07:51,666
Sorry, got caught up in a
cliche there for a minute.

1258
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:52,500
No, that's fine.

1259
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,667
It happens to the best of us.

1260
01:08:02,875 --> 01:08:06,333
I can smell ya, ya little shit.

1261
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,582
No, you can't!

1262
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:09,791
Oh, fuck!

1263
01:08:09,792 --> 01:08:11,042
I can! I can!

1264
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:15,874
Fuck! Fuck you, cocksucker!

1265
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,292
Wait the fuck up!

1266
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:58,500
Help me.

1267
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:06,166
Queen, you've got a little
something on your face there.

1268
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:07,167
Mmm.

1269
01:10:08,333 --> 01:10:09,167
Better?

1270
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:11,208
No. More here.

1271
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:14,541
What about now?

1272
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:16,499
Perfection, my queen.

1273
01:10:16,500 --> 01:10:18,582
You're so good to me, sweet Nina.

1274
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:19,583
And you to me.

1275
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:25,832
Arvid, find the rest and hurry.

1276
01:10:25,833 --> 01:10:28,791
I hunger and the night grows short.

1277
01:10:28,792 --> 01:10:30,042
I understand.

1278
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:33,457
Come along, grandma.

1279
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:36,041
No, no, I want, I
want, I want the blood.

1280
01:10:36,042 --> 01:10:39,791
I want, I, I, I want the
blood, I want the blood.

1281
01:10:39,792 --> 01:10:40,625
Come.

1282
01:10:40,626 --> 01:10:43,166
We'll find you some man meat.

1283
01:10:43,167 --> 01:10:44,208
Man meat? Man meat?

1284
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,082
Oh, I love man meat!

1285
01:10:49,083 --> 01:10:51,374
Arvid, it's nearly dawn.

1286
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:53,582
The goths will retreat.

1287
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:55,082
We have to end this now.

1288
01:10:55,083 --> 01:10:56,208
I understand.

1289
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,791
What shall we do with the leftovers?

1290
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:03,792
They never keep.

1291
01:11:05,292 --> 01:11:07,208
Prop him out. He could be useful.

1292
01:11:10,208 --> 01:11:11,332
Oh, shit!

1293
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:12,625
Uh, hide somewhere.

1294
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:15,750
Oh, god.

1295
01:11:18,833 --> 01:11:21,707
So did see you Ivan? Did he get away or?

1296
01:11:21,708 --> 01:11:24,582
I don't know. I heard a scream.

1297
01:11:24,583 --> 01:11:26,832
Oh, shit! Shit!

1298
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,124
I think it's worse.

1299
01:11:28,125 --> 01:11:29,291
I think they got Bob.

1300
01:11:29,292 --> 01:11:32,291
Oh, not Bob. Not Bob.

1301
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:34,082
First Lauren and Evan,

1302
01:11:34,083 --> 01:11:35,124
Marco something-or-other,

1303
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:37,166
now Ivan's missing and Bob?

1304
01:11:37,167 --> 01:11:39,041
We've gotta somehow vomit ourselves

1305
01:11:39,042 --> 01:11:40,292
out of this situation.

1306
01:11:42,708 --> 01:11:43,957
"Blood queen 4."

1307
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:44,833
Oh.

1308
01:11:44,834 --> 01:11:47,499
"Blood queen 4." 1987.

1309
01:11:47,500 --> 01:11:49,457
The blood queen returns to Los Angeles

1310
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:51,457
to hunt those who hunt her,

1311
01:11:51,458 --> 01:11:53,041
taking the city on a wild ride

1312
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,791
that will soon not forget.

1313
01:11:54,792 --> 01:11:57,457
Yeah, it's got that scene
with the vampire dogs

1314
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,582
and that actress.

1315
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,542
Uh, what's her name?

1316
01:11:59,542 --> 01:12:00,375
Quinley rod.

1317
01:12:00,375 --> 01:12:01,208
Right, quinley rod.

1318
01:12:01,209 --> 01:12:02,749
She was also in "hell basket."

1319
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,541
She did that thing with
her boobs and the lipstick.

1320
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:06,957
Yeah, classic.

1321
01:12:06,958 --> 01:12:07,917
Oh, instant classic.

1322
01:12:07,918 --> 01:12:09,499
Scared the shit out of
me when I was a kid.

1323
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,166
- Kind of turned me on.
- Totally dope.

1324
01:12:12,167 --> 01:12:13,249
What?

1325
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,250
Nothing.

1326
01:12:15,750 --> 01:12:16,916
Okay.

1327
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,416
"Blood queen 4."

1328
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,957
I mean, how does that help us now?

1329
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:24,207
Bathtub full of holy water?

1330
01:12:24,208 --> 01:12:26,041
Bathtub full of holy water.

1331
01:12:26,042 --> 01:12:28,332
Right, okay. Don't we need a priest?

1332
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,541
- I'm ordained.
- What?

1333
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,416
- Yeah, did it online.
- Took like 10 minutes.

1334
01:12:32,417 --> 01:12:33,999
Church of the midnight munchies.

1335
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:34,917
I'm a minister.

1336
01:12:34,918 --> 01:12:37,041
That's, uh, that's really, uh-

1337
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:38,457
- handy?
- Convenient.

1338
01:12:38,458 --> 01:12:40,916
I know. Turn the water on.

1339
01:12:40,917 --> 01:12:42,750
Let's get this ritual started.

1340
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,707
Ho-ho-ho!

1341
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:34,499
Max rampage!

1342
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,332
Rampage media!

1343
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:39,832
The largest distributor
of independent horror

1344
01:13:39,833 --> 01:13:41,000
on the planet!

1345
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:45,124
Jesus Christ, hurry up!

1346
01:13:55,750 --> 01:13:57,417
Come on! Is that it?

1347
01:14:00,958 --> 01:14:02,082
- I think so.
- What?

1348
01:14:02,083 --> 01:14:02,917
What do you mean you think so?

1349
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:05,041
It's my first time. It's fine.

1350
01:14:05,042 --> 01:14:06,000
It's not fine!

1351
01:14:06,001 --> 01:14:07,707
We based our entire plan around this

1352
01:14:07,708 --> 01:14:09,388
and you don't even know
if it's gonna work!

1353
01:14:11,793 --> 01:14:12,958
Oh, shit! Quick, hide!

1354
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:20,082
Max rampage!

1355
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:22,458
You're a really shitty
distribution company!

1356
01:14:42,583 --> 01:14:44,582
- One down.
- Five to go.

1357
01:14:44,583 --> 01:14:46,166
Ugh.

1358
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:47,167
Plan?

1359
01:14:48,792 --> 01:14:49,957
What?

1360
01:14:49,958 --> 01:14:51,999
"Vampire holocaust."

1361
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:53,167
Oh, Italian!

1362
01:14:54,292 --> 01:14:58,332
Directed by Mario pesulli,
starring ilene cordacelli.

1363
01:14:58,333 --> 01:14:59,250
Well, that's brilliant.

1364
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:01,166
That's, that's brilliant.

1365
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:04,291
Thank you.

1366
01:15:04,292 --> 01:15:05,541
Ugh.

1367
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,125
Do ya, do ya think?

1368
01:15:08,375 --> 01:15:10,625
Only one way to find out.

1369
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:18,458
Stinks!

1370
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,707
I think it...

1371
01:15:25,458 --> 01:15:26,458
Got it.

1372
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,333
- All you.
- Oh.

1373
01:15:33,750 --> 01:15:37,291
Oh, fuck!

1374
01:15:37,292 --> 01:15:38,916
"Vampire holocaust?"

1375
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:40,750
"Vampire holocaust."

1376
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,667
You got it, you got it.

1377
01:15:48,333 --> 01:15:49,916
How does it look?

1378
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,333
Oh, ust great.

1379
01:15:52,208 --> 01:15:55,499
Oh, come on. Suck it up. Geez.

1380
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,750
Get the other one.

1381
01:15:58,917 --> 01:16:00,999
I'm bored.

1382
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,416
We have to find the interlopers.

1383
01:16:03,417 --> 01:16:04,874
I'm hungry!

1384
01:16:04,875 --> 01:16:07,082
You'll eat soon, grandma.

1385
01:16:07,083 --> 01:16:09,332
I'm hungry now!

1386
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:12,833
What?

1387
01:16:13,750 --> 01:16:15,707
Perhaps you should go to bed now.

1388
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:17,207
It's getting early.

1389
01:16:17,208 --> 01:16:18,500
Fuck that.

1390
01:16:19,542 --> 01:16:21,333
I wanna kill someone.

1391
01:16:22,208 --> 01:16:24,125
You promised me man meat.

1392
01:16:25,333 --> 01:16:26,333
So I did.

1393
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:31,167
Stay here.

1394
01:16:32,208 --> 01:16:33,208
What?

1395
01:16:35,250 --> 01:16:36,250
Man meat.

1396
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:38,625
I want man meat.

1397
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,042
I want man meat now.

1398
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:45,292
Man meat.

1399
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,000
Yum, yum.

1400
01:16:51,667 --> 01:16:54,207
Have you found him?

1401
01:16:54,208 --> 01:16:55,375
I, I've not.

1402
01:16:57,792 --> 01:16:59,416
I don't understand.

1403
01:16:59,417 --> 01:17:00,250
Did the queen-

1404
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:02,291
- turn me into a vampire?

1405
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:03,957
Of course, you fool.

1406
01:17:03,958 --> 01:17:06,416
I am one of you now.

1407
01:17:10,708 --> 01:17:14,207
I can smell your blood.

1408
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:16,666
You dare to question, oh shit.

1409
01:17:16,667 --> 01:17:18,249
Hold on, these fucking things.

1410
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:19,332
They suck.

1411
01:17:19,333 --> 01:17:22,916
Okay, I am a vampire!

1412
01:17:36,625 --> 01:17:37,458
Aw!

1413
01:17:37,459 --> 01:17:40,374
I think I got some in my mouth.

1414
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:41,416
It's gross.

1415
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:42,582
Yeah, well, you aren't the one with

1416
01:17:42,583 --> 01:17:44,625
the rotten vampire teeth in your mouth.

1417
01:17:49,833 --> 01:17:51,166
Oh!

1418
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,292
Christ, what?

1419
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:54,875
Stabby, stabby.

1420
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:58,374
"Vampire holocaust." It worked!

1421
01:17:58,375 --> 01:18:00,499
I can't believe it.

1422
01:18:00,500 --> 01:18:02,499
I'm very happy for you.

1423
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:03,500
Wait.

1424
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:05,542
Do you hear that?

1425
01:18:06,750 --> 01:18:08,207
What?

1426
01:18:08,208 --> 01:18:09,499
I don't hear anything.

1427
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,291
Exactly. The music.

1428
01:18:11,292 --> 01:18:12,292
It stopped.

1429
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,457
But why?

1430
01:18:18,458 --> 01:18:20,458
Dude, who cares! Let's go!

1431
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,082
- It's almost dawn.
- I'm aware.

1432
01:18:28,083 --> 01:18:30,833
If we can't catch them, then we've lost.

1433
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:32,916
What shall we do?

1434
01:18:32,917 --> 01:18:34,416
We retreat.

1435
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:36,082
We live to fight another day.

1436
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,083
We are immortal.

1437
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:39,917
We have all the time in the world.

1438
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:42,457
This isn't the end, my love.

1439
01:18:42,458 --> 01:18:43,667
It's only the beginning.

1440
01:18:44,917 --> 01:18:46,499
My friend

1441
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:49,833
on the last slay ride

1442
01:18:59,667 --> 01:19:03,332
Whoa.

1443
01:19:03,333 --> 01:19:04,333
Lauren.

1444
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:07,667
Can you hear it, osh?

1445
01:19:08,583 --> 01:19:09,583
The beat?

1446
01:19:10,542 --> 01:19:11,875
The driving tempo?

1447
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:15,375
Fills your veins.

1448
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:17,750
It moves you.

1449
01:19:20,292 --> 01:19:21,333
Come, lover.

1450
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:23,917
Sing this corrosion to me.

1451
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:27,042
Join me in this dance of death.

1452
01:19:29,250 --> 01:19:31,708
Sway your body against mine.

1453
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:34,875
Live forever.

1454
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:37,207
Oh!

1455
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:39,666
"Vampire holocaust," bitch!

1456
01:19:39,667 --> 01:19:42,707
Ah!

1457
01:19:42,708 --> 01:19:44,042
My kidneys!

1458
01:19:45,792 --> 01:19:47,749
God, you pushed me on the stairs.

1459
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:48,750
Lauren!

1460
01:19:50,708 --> 01:19:52,291
Where'd she go?

1461
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,791
Who cares? Let'sust go.

1462
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:07,708
Yeah!

1463
01:20:07,709 --> 01:20:09,207
Way to go, Bob!

1464
01:20:09,208 --> 01:20:10,832
Best background actor ever!

1465
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:12,207
Come on! Let's get out of here, man!

1466
01:20:12,208 --> 01:20:13,208
We're gonna get...

1467
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,500
But, I.

1468
01:20:17,625 --> 01:20:20,417
Oh, Bob!

1469
01:20:22,333 --> 01:20:23,458
Isn't fair.

1470
01:20:24,917 --> 01:20:28,000
"The dead within," 1968.

1471
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:32,833
"The dead within," 1968.

1472
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:38,082
A brave explorer on safari
through the darkest corners

1473
01:20:38,083 --> 01:20:42,332
of Africa sacrifices
himself to save his friends

1474
01:20:42,333 --> 01:20:44,292
from the evil that threatened them all.

1475
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,833
The first black vampire.

1476
01:20:48,708 --> 01:20:53,416
With Bella namoha and
Jack labaron and Bob targon

1477
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:54,375
as the hero.

1478
01:20:54,376 --> 01:20:56,749
Yeah, Bob. Bob targon, man.

1479
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,249
Bob targon's like my favorite actor.

1480
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:00,207
Do you know he got death threats for years

1481
01:21:00,208 --> 01:21:01,624
after he made that movie?

1482
01:21:01,625 --> 01:21:03,791
I read all about it in his autobiography.

1483
01:21:03,792 --> 01:21:05,916
And that movie is actually
a lot more important

1484
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:08,707
to the cinematic history of
horror than one might think.

1485
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:10,707
It really opened the
door for blaxplotation

1486
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:12,582
vampire films, you know?

1487
01:21:12,583 --> 01:21:15,041
Like, uh, "vampula" and "ebony Vixen."

1488
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:16,791
Oh, I love "ebony Vixen."

1489
01:21:16,792 --> 01:21:18,582
Right, "die, vampula, die."

1490
01:21:18,583 --> 01:21:19,624
And the "African gods."

1491
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,249
Right, yeah. 1981.

1492
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,749
Although that's a little bit
more of a voodoo-xplotation

1493
01:21:23,750 --> 01:21:25,082
film than a vampire flick.

1494
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:26,416
That's true, I guess.

1495
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:27,624
But it still has vampires in it.

1496
01:21:27,625 --> 01:21:28,791
Well, sure, but I mean,

1497
01:21:28,792 --> 01:21:30,624
if we're gonna go by that criteria,

1498
01:21:30,625 --> 01:21:31,666
then all of a sudden we have to start

1499
01:21:31,667 --> 01:21:33,416
counting Dr. Night as a vampire.

1500
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:36,958
Of course he's a vampire!

1501
01:21:47,917 --> 01:21:49,332
I'll miss you, Bob.

1502
01:21:49,333 --> 01:21:50,500
You're the best, Bob.

1503
01:21:51,417 --> 01:21:52,666
You're the best.

1504
01:21:52,667 --> 01:21:54,291
You know, I was even
gonna give you a couple

1505
01:21:54,292 --> 01:21:55,416
of lines in the next film!

1506
01:21:55,417 --> 01:21:57,625
You really, really earned it.

1507
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:01,249
Bye, Bob.

1508
01:22:01,250 --> 01:22:03,166
Thanks for everything.

1509
01:22:03,167 --> 01:22:04,624
You're the best.

1510
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:06,374
You were always there for us.

1511
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:07,874
You're very professional.

1512
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,749
You taught me so much.

1513
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,249
You're a good friend.

1514
01:22:11,250 --> 01:22:12,750
You deserve more lines.

1515
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:18,249
You, uh, you had an
impeccable fashion sense.

1516
01:22:18,250 --> 01:22:21,250
You had a great smile.

1517
01:22:23,917 --> 01:22:26,166
You were mostly clean shaven.

1518
01:22:26,167 --> 01:22:30,792
You, uh, were a good driver?

1519
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:33,874
Oh, you were tall.

1520
01:22:33,875 --> 01:22:36,166
Yeah, yeah. He was kind of tall.

1521
01:22:36,167 --> 01:22:37,000
Uh-huh.

1522
01:22:37,001 --> 01:22:38,125
You, uh.

1523
01:22:39,625 --> 01:22:40,625
You.

1524
01:22:42,042 --> 01:22:43,207
Shit.

1525
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:44,208
Well.

1526
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:48,207
He gave us the, ah, fuck it.

1527
01:22:48,208 --> 01:22:49,291
I got nothin'.

1528
01:22:49,292 --> 01:22:51,082
- Yeah, me neither.
- Yeah.

1529
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:52,583
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1530
01:23:04,958 --> 01:23:07,166
I should've worn aacket.

1531
01:23:07,167 --> 01:23:09,083
Yeah, what's the forecast?

1532
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:11,417
It's December.

1533
01:23:14,208 --> 01:23:15,916
Ugh.

1534
01:23:15,917 --> 01:23:17,666
Hey!

1535
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:19,041
Hey!

1536
01:23:19,042 --> 01:23:21,332
Great, you made it.

1537
01:23:21,333 --> 01:23:22,916
Well, duh. Clearly.

1538
01:23:22,917 --> 01:23:24,791
Sorry for what I said about your acting.

1539
01:23:24,792 --> 01:23:26,541
It wasn't that bad.

1540
01:23:26,542 --> 01:23:28,875
It was golden. Shut up.

1541
01:23:31,667 --> 01:23:32,667
So what now?

1542
01:23:34,083 --> 01:23:36,374
"Midnight in the garden of blood."

1543
01:23:36,375 --> 01:23:37,749
The reboot?

1544
01:23:37,750 --> 01:23:40,166
The original, 1987?

1545
01:23:40,167 --> 01:23:42,707
Oh, yeah. With Aaron
Murray, frank delito,

1546
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:43,999
and Eve durden, right?

1547
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,833
Eve Parker.

1548
01:23:44,834 --> 01:23:49,082
Eve durden was the "catness of
black: Blood muncher," 1988?

1549
01:23:49,083 --> 01:23:50,624
You sure about that?

1550
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:51,625
I'm sure.

1551
01:23:52,917 --> 01:23:54,124
All right.

1552
01:23:54,125 --> 01:23:55,624
"Midnight in the garden of blood."

1553
01:23:55,625 --> 01:23:58,124
The survivors of a brutal vampiric attack

1554
01:23:58,125 --> 01:23:59,874
decide to band together to snuff out

1555
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,624
the evil that escaped their vengeance.

1556
01:24:02,625 --> 01:24:03,957
That's the one.

1557
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:07,874
"Midnight in the garden of blood."

1558
01:24:07,875 --> 01:24:08,875
Pssshh!

1559
01:24:10,208 --> 01:24:12,792
All right, put your seatbelt on.

1560
01:24:30,167 --> 01:24:31,167
Where?

1561
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:33,000
Where?

1562
01:24:34,125 --> 01:24:35,125
Where?

1563
01:24:36,083 --> 01:24:38,207
Where is everybody?

1564
01:24:38,208 --> 01:24:41,916
I can't be found

1565
01:24:41,917 --> 01:24:46,166
sunset all around

1566
01:24:46,167 --> 01:24:49,333
and the waves shine

1567
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:51,833
oh, fuck!

1568
01:24:52,833 --> 01:24:54,291
Oh!

1569
01:24:58,917 --> 01:25:06,917
Sunshine

1570
01:25:15,750 --> 01:25:19,499
the place I go

1571
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:23,749
to feel truly free

1572
01:25:23,750 --> 01:25:27,749
never caught or held down

1573
01:25:27,750 --> 01:25:32,082
no storms around

1574
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:36,082
and the waves shine

1575
01:25:36,083 --> 01:25:40,291
and your all mine

1576
01:25:40,292 --> 01:25:44,749
in the wind I breathe

1577
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:52,750
sunshine

1578
01:26:35,375 --> 01:26:38,957
I met with an old friend the other day

1579
01:26:38,958 --> 01:26:42,916
she said she hadn't
seen me in 13 long years

1580
01:26:42,917 --> 01:26:46,624
I looked down on the tarmac and I said

1581
01:26:46,625 --> 01:26:50,457
I haven't seen you in that long either

1582
01:26:50,458 --> 01:26:53,082
we exchanged smiles and
heartbreak and stories

1583
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:56,207
by the parked vans
with bumper stickers

1584
01:26:56,208 --> 01:26:58,374
and without word she said

1585
01:26:58,375 --> 01:27:00,166
my husband left me and
I'm raising these kids

1586
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:05,167
on a minimum three
part-timeob and shit

1587
01:27:05,917 --> 01:27:09,791
well, I hope you're doing
all right with your life

1588
01:27:09,792 --> 01:27:13,624
and I'm doing okay with mine, I guess

1589
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:17,457
well, the last time I
saw you, we were thriving

1590
01:27:17,458 --> 01:27:22,458
well, we were doingust fine

1591
01:27:23,542 --> 01:27:28,542
well, I hope you're doingust fine

1592
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:35,750
I hope you're doingust fine

1593
01:27:37,625 --> 01:27:41,541
I hope you're doing all right

1594
01:27:41,542 --> 01:27:45,499
doingust fine, too

1595
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:50,500
I guess I'm doing all
right myself, I guess

1596
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:53,458
sometimes

1597
01:27:59,792 --> 01:28:03,416
I haven't seen my uncle
in a shit ton of years

1598
01:28:03,417 --> 01:28:07,416
and we know his heart
stopped and he died

1599
01:28:07,417 --> 01:28:10,999
and my grandmother, the
one on my dad's side

1600
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,041
I have to remind her who
I am every time I see her

1601
01:28:15,042 --> 01:28:16,666
but I hope that when his kids

1602
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:18,957
have Christmas dinner each year

1603
01:28:18,958 --> 01:28:20,874
they remember the way that I look

1604
01:28:20,875 --> 01:28:23,374
and I said the things like

1605
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:25,791
that fire has a good log on it

1606
01:28:25,792 --> 01:28:30,499
it's burning bright
like grandma's eyes

1607
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:34,291
and I told my mom I like
the way that she cooks

1608
01:28:34,292 --> 01:28:38,166
I hope she likes the
way that I cook, too

1609
01:28:38,167 --> 01:28:46,167
and we have Christmas dinner each year

1610
01:28:47,583 --> 01:28:51,207
and we'reust doing all right
