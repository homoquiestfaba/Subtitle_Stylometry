Proudly Presents
WATER FOR ELEPHANTS

3
00:00:09,233 --> 00:00:11,487
Translated from dutch

4
00:01:07,361 --> 00:01:09,772
Excuse me, sir,
Can We Help?

5
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:14,279
Can we help you with something?
- Did I miss the show?

6
00:01:14,575 --> 00:01:18,472
I am afraid so.
The show was this afternoon.

7
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:25,234
Did you participate with the group from Green Haven?
Come, we will call them for you

8
00:01:26,203 --> 00:01:29,323
No, I was on my own.
- It's okay.

9
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:32,283
We call it home
so they pick you up.

10
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:40,192
I say that I was alone. Maybe you
without those rings are not deaf and dumb.

11
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:45,767
He is very attentive.
- Sorry, I meant it not.

12
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:51,727
Your rings look very nice.

13
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:57,460
Take that back to my trailer walker
so we can pack.

14
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:01,877
I have to pick this car park.
Go sit in the wheelchair...

15
00:02:02,077 --> 00:02:05,783
and then we go inside to call.
Please.

16
00:02:08,756 --> 00:02:12,523
Drive through.
- How are you?

17
00:02:12,524 --> 00:02:18,116
I seek 's song I do not think.
A nursing home, Greenhaven.

18
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:20,564
Hopefully, they sweat.

19
00:02:20,565 --> 00:02:23,724
I went without anyone noticing
out.

20
00:02:23,824 --> 00:02:30,091
Greenhaven. A nursing home.
Hello?

21
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:33,986
Hagenbeck-Wallace for bankruptcy.

22
00:02:34,325 --> 00:02:38,121
Yes, you know circuses?
- I've been on two.

23
00:02:38,122 --> 00:02:43,418
Can I still call to someone else?
- The first was the Benzini Brothers.

24
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:47,398
Benzini Brothers. When?
- 1931.

25
00:02:47,498 --> 00:02:50,007
How long?

26
00:02:52,741 --> 00:02:58,267
You know them by the end of 1931
have never met.

27
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:01,702
Tell me now that you were there...
- There in the middle.

28
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:05,759
Incredibly, because after the fire at Harper
and the bankruptcy of Hagenbeck-Wallace...

29
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,841
is the most famous circus tragedy ever.

30
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,603
Are you okay?

31
00:03:20,604 --> 00:03:24,387
Need something else to drink
than apple juice?

32
00:03:26,413 --> 00:03:28,774
Yes, I think so.

33
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,485
Please.

34
00:03:49,451 --> 00:03:52,926
I remember you.
- How long have you been in that nursing home?

35
00:03:53,026 --> 00:03:58,007
Too long. Why do they call it
a house? You know nobody there.

36
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:02,373
They give you so many drugs
that you do not care anymore.

37
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:07,104
Five children and none of them
I can stay since their mother died.

38
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,310
They take turns visiting.

39
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:17,178
My son forgot whose turn it was, limiting speeds...

40
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:21,616
I can 't blame him.
He is 71, begin to forget.

41
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:26,342
'S are not bad kids.
It's not their fault that I am old.

42
00:04:26,343 --> 00:04:30,198
I had a good life.

43
00:04:30,964 --> 00:04:34,275
A grand life.

44
00:04:34,792 --> 00:04:37,355
Sit down.

45
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,733
I'm sorry.
My name is Charlie O'Brian III.

46
00:04:44,444 --> 00:04:48,062
Jacob Jankowski, the only one.

47
00:04:48,769 --> 00:04:51,155
Well found.

48
00:04:51,156 --> 00:04:54,205
You should not call the nursing home?

49
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:56,930
Let them sweat.

50
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:02,019
But if I could, I was wondering...

51
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,378
can you tell me what
happened in 1931?

52
00:05:10,219 --> 00:05:13,272
We will need another bottle.

53
00:05:14,512 --> 00:05:17,921
It was a big day:
My last exam.

54
00:05:17,922 --> 00:05:21,535
I was not fast enough.
My life was finally beginning.

55
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:24,560
And I knew exactly where it lives
bring me to send it.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,003
In our house there was no sign of 's depression.

57
00:05:34,038 --> 00:05:37,469
My mother and father had
Poland in worse condition.

58
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:42,733
According to them, none could be poor in America.

59
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,732
I love you.
- I love you.

60
00:06:05,654 --> 00:06:10,524
After six years of dissections,
castrations and my hand in a cow of his hole...

61
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:17,289
more often than I care to remember,
I was in 't end of the day a veterinarian.

62
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:21,603
And that at the end of that evening I was
the first boy to Catherine Hale...

63
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:25,900
ever 'r bed had been invited.
She loved me.

64
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:30,874
You have two hours for the exam
finish. When it is finished...

65
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:36,013
close the book, put the
upside down and raise your hand.

66
00:06:36,048 --> 00:06:40,518
With my approval you can 't
exam to bring me...

67
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:44,205
and leave. Play on.

68
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:48,437
I had a new life mapped out.

69
00:06:48,472 --> 00:06:51,848
And then with it open to show a door...

70
00:06:51,883 --> 00:06:56,274
lost all my plans.
- Mr. Jankowski?

71
00:06:57,552 --> 00:07:00,889
May we talk here?

72
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:19,021
Jacob, I fear that there is a
car accident.

73
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:49,289
Can we still call relatives?

74
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:08,868
According to our record, there is no
error, Mr. Jankowski.

75
00:08:08,869 --> 00:08:12,230
The house and all possessions,
with the practice of your father...

76
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,298
his possession of the bank loan due.
- You got it wrong.

77
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:21,330
My father owned the house.
- These documents were four years ago...

78
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:25,322
signed by him.
They had something when money is needed?

79
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:29,275
My school.
- There you have it.

80
00:08:29,276 --> 00:08:32,927
If you're not going to college
gone, you had a house.

81
00:08:33,856 --> 00:08:37,580
But as your father did his business,
is highly unlikely.

82
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:42,325
My father was feeling good man.
He offered more assistance to...

83
00:08:42,326 --> 00:08:45,606
He was a irresponsible man.

84
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:49,923
People could pay him
with chickens and eggs, everything...

85
00:08:49,924 --> 00:08:52,441
instead of money.

86
00:08:52,476 --> 00:08:55,725
This longstanding depression on.

87
00:08:55,726 --> 00:09:01,202
And the only people who do not suffer
are the ones who take what is needed.

88
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:03,972
Do not make the same mistake as him.

89
00:09:44,104 --> 00:09:47,501
I remember that through the front door
left.

90
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,191
I forced myself not to look back.

91
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:00,749
I could not stay where I
I would remember them.

92
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,707
I saw it again at no point in
go to school.

93
00:10:04,857 --> 00:10:08,502
There were many men when
no home, no family.

94
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:11,200
Living in small villages
where they died.

95
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,727
It was rumored that there was work
in the big cities.

96
00:10:13,762 --> 00:10:17,282
So I got it in my head
to walk to Albania.

97
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:19,819
I've never met.

98
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:50,577
Do not tamper with Blackie. People
Trains throwing is part of his work.

99
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:53,034
We do not need bums on this train.

100
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:58,630
Quiet. Put the gun away.
Let him go.

101
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:01,977
And I mean on the inside
of the train.

102
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,607
I say not you, we want no problems.
Look at his clothes.

103
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,842
He's not a tramp.

104
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:16,573
No fear, it's almost a reflex of the m.

105
00:12:16,574 --> 00:12:20,955
I am Camel.
They are Grady and Wade.

106
00:12:21,463 --> 00:12:25,669
I'm Jacob Jankowski.
- Jankowski?

107
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:27,190
Poland?

108
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:37,957
Thanks.
- You're young to roam. Are you running?

109
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,125
No, no such thing.
- Where are you going?

110
00:12:42,077 --> 00:12:44,557
No idea.
- Are you hungry?

111
00:12:44,558 --> 00:12:48,473
No work? You must therefore
not ashamed.

112
00:12:48,508 --> 00:12:52,856
What can you do?
- Everything, I suppose.

113
00:12:53,155 --> 00:12:57,145
We are in Deposit morning.
We look for work there for you...

114
00:12:57,146 --> 00:13:00,081
and if you still alive in the evening,
I'll take you to August...

115
00:13:00,181 --> 00:13:03,632
the master of the
known and unknown universe itself.

116
00:13:03,732 --> 00:13:05,485
Who is that?

117
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:09,246
Hang on, you start
the ride of your life.

118
00:13:58,752 --> 00:14:01,554
Quiet.

119
00:14:06,265 --> 00:14:10,702
See that?

120
00:15:34,077 --> 00:15:38,031
I do not know if that train me
train if I have chosen...

121
00:15:39,993 --> 00:15:43,781
but something told me that my parents
I have moved ahead.

122
00:15:44,466 --> 00:15:47,024
That is all I believe.

123
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,942
Hello, ma'am.

124
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:54,659
What are you doing here?
Go out of there.

125
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,875
You do not hear from the menagerie.
Come on.

126
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,497
I have work for you.
- Animal?

127
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:02,444
Be sure.

128
00:16:06,368 --> 00:16:10,682
Much manure I've never seen.
It holds 27 in a wagon.

129
00:16:16,502 --> 00:16:20,924
How do you endure the smell?
- What smell?

130
00:16:20,932 --> 00:16:26,214
Ladies and gentlemen, come see
to the staggering collection...

131
00:16:26,314 --> 00:16:30,618
of miracles in this world.

132
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,788
If he gives the signal,
we ought to push people to the entrance.

133
00:16:34,789 --> 00:16:37,526
The rest follows
all will be well.

134
00:16:37,852 --> 00:16:40,421
Utter perfection.

135
00:16:40,983 --> 00:16:45,627
All but a dime
and believe me it will be your best edition ever.

136
00:16:45,628 --> 00:16:49,537
I guarantee you.
This way.

137
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:52,177
Ladies on the right side,
men left.

138
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,387
Foot for foot and the body follows.

139
00:16:55,388 --> 00:16:59,598
Take this. Save with it...

140
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:03,274
when you see heads peek
without paying.

141
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,603
Silver.

142
00:18:25,773 --> 00:18:29,179
Good boy.

143
00:18:29,658 --> 00:18:31,932
You okay?

144
00:18:32,406 --> 00:18:34,728
You're shaking "a bit.

145
00:18:43,912 --> 00:18:46,003
Excuse me, ma'am?

146
00:18:47,867 --> 00:18:50,443
Can I see?

147
00:19:04,044 --> 00:19:06,529
Walk on.

148
00:19:08,698 --> 00:19:10,983
Stacey, walking.

149
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:25,796
Showtime. Forward.

150
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:37,490
Ladies and gentlemen...

151
00:19:37,491 --> 00:19:43,003
and children of all ages,
welcome to 's most extravagant...

152
00:19:43,038 --> 00:19:45,115
it 's human eye can see.

153
00:19:45,215 --> 00:19:51,643
Welcome the stars of the Benzini Brothers
most spectacular show in the world.

154
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,590
She seemed at first not really.

155
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:06,375
How she looked in that big arena.
Among those lights.

156
00:21:07,137 --> 00:21:10,461
This phenomenon almost blinded me.

157
00:21:10,814 --> 00:21:15,449
Benzini Brothers surpass God.
They created the sky in one day.

158
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:21,146
And just as soon the sky again.

159
00:21:25,843 --> 00:21:29,401
Take a breath, but otherwise
throw it all out again.

160
00:21:36,531 --> 00:21:41,436
What is that?
- Jake, all we have.

161
00:21:41,437 --> 00:21:44,088
Damn cheap junk.

162
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:47,418
I am not an American man
a drink to remember.

163
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,366
Will not change the constitution,
then a man is entitled to happiness?

164
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:56,981
Come on, I'll take you to August.

165
00:21:57,016 --> 00:22:01,132
Now? It is night.
- Then the circus alive.

166
00:22:01,232 --> 00:22:04,619
Musicians and entertainers
standing above us, but...

167
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:10,010
In the special numbers
which are under the trainer.

168
00:22:10,011 --> 00:22:13,850
Everyone is under the bosses.
Never forget that.

169
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,050
Note these clowns.
Nobody touched by this corridor intact.

170
00:22:18,423 --> 00:22:22,562
Lucinda, my dear.
Good evening, how are you?

171
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,059
You let it shine here.
- I know you. I saw you in my show.

172
00:22:28,094 --> 00:22:31,306
Do you want a private dance?

173
00:22:32,065 --> 00:22:35,542
How's your pipe?
- Calm down, Barbara.

174
00:22:35,543 --> 00:22:38,635
Good evening, ladies.
- We can do it.

175
00:22:39,661 --> 00:22:43,298
We think like him.
- Good evening. Do not talk...

176
00:22:43,398 --> 00:22:46,839
Before you familiar with our language
if your head is stamped...

177
00:22:46,939 --> 00:22:50,788
as a villager in the city
and artists are artists...

178
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:55,298
certainly not directly say.
- How do I call them?

179
00:22:55,398 --> 00:22:58,303
Artists.
Do not talk to them and you live longer.

180
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:04,476
Be quiet in here, because we have
show respect to the ladies. Men.

181
00:23:05,448 --> 00:23:08,353
Camel, who is the woman who
the horses work?

182
00:23:08,388 --> 00:23:10,912
That is the wife of the boss.

183
00:23:10,913 --> 00:23:15,081
Marlena. The main attraction
and they talk to anyone.

184
00:23:15,181 --> 00:23:18,447
And you are not with her.
She points on you anyway.

185
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:23,107
I have a son same age as you.
He lives in Pennsylvania.

186
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,349
I 'm not seen for years.

187
00:23:28,455 --> 00:23:31,030
Put your shirt properly.

188
00:23:32,383 --> 00:23:35,862
Before we do this, I ask you something
and I want to use does not interfere...

189
00:23:35,863 --> 00:23:38,746
but I do know that you still
not long wandering.

190
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:44,439
So, before you start I must ask you:
If you got a life back to where you can...

191
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:47,427
you should do that.

192
00:23:47,462 --> 00:23:49,222
I did not.

193
00:23:49,282 --> 00:23:52,279
I'm sorry.

194
00:23:52,741 --> 00:23:58,500
Remember, let me talk.
And never talk about the Ringling Brothers.

195
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:01,506
He hates them tremendously.

196
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:05,476
This is Earl and he will let you in.

197
00:24:05,511 --> 00:24:08,116
This is Jacob.

198
00:24:08,117 --> 00:24:10,452
Pleasant.

199
00:24:18,162 --> 00:24:20,623
What is this?
- A stowaway...

200
00:24:20,624 --> 00:24:23,505
Polish those alcoholic
took under his wing.

201
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,804
A college boy.

202
00:24:26,087 --> 00:24:29,777
I think we know each other yet.
- Jacob Jankowski, sir.

203
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:33,261
And what do I do with 'n Jacob Jankowski do?

204
00:24:34,212 --> 00:24:37,558
I'm looking for other work.
- Have you ever worked?

205
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:39,802
No, sir.
- Ever seen a show?

206
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:42,623
Yes, the Ringling Brothers.

207
00:24:49,032 --> 00:24:54,016
Ringling, eh?
- Yes, they were bad.

208
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:00,853
They try to do, right guys?

209
00:25:03,107 --> 00:25:06,786
Have you seen our show?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:25:06,821 --> 00:25:08,970
What is your favorite act?

211
00:25:09,005 --> 00:25:11,673
The one with the white and black horses.

212
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,940
You notice a lot.
My best part.

213
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:20,624
I do believe that we have someone
Search for the elephants.

214
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:22,984
We do not have elephants.

215
00:25:23,361 --> 00:25:26,214
That sounds perfect.
I like working with animals.

216
00:25:26,249 --> 00:25:27,815
Come here.

217
00:25:33,228 --> 00:25:35,830
Is this a day?

218
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:41,013
Why would a college boy are
hands dirty?

219
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:44,437
I think because among all
sweat and dirt...

220
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:48,457
you like working with these men that
do not participate in daylight to be seen.

221
00:25:49,128 --> 00:25:52,152
So much beauty.
- Streaming now with me?

222
00:25:52,153 --> 00:25:55,557
No, sir.
- That was nicely said.

223
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:59,706
Still traveling in my train,
eat my dinner without permission...

224
00:25:59,707 --> 00:26:03,747
while hard working men
every day for the same things.

225
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:07,080
And this mess is my family.
You're an intruder.

226
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:12,070
Throw him there the next stop.
He studied poetry down.

227
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,267
I study veterinary science,
no poetry.

228
00:26:15,268 --> 00:26:17,960
And I can tell you something:
That top horse of your...

229
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:21,422
can in a couple weeks not walk,
let alone make a presentation.

230
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,408
Wait.

231
00:26:25,198 --> 00:26:28,226
Veterinary Medicine?
What school?

232
00:26:28,227 --> 00:26:31,647
Cornell.
- A Cornell graduate?

233
00:26:33,479 --> 00:26:37,392
He shoveled manure or afternoon.
Pretty good.

234
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:41,207
He is not a horse doctor
horse shit all day because he was intercepted.

235
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,420
Ringling has established its own vet.

236
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,178
Cornell, come on.

237
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,309
Are you sure?
- Yes.

238
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,404
Good.

239
00:27:12,594 --> 00:27:15,029
Unbelievable.

240
00:27:15,354 --> 00:27:18,383
Breathtaking, huh?

241
00:27:24,323 --> 00:27:28,939
My star is lame and I get no horse
middle of it season.

242
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:34,045
So, make sure the horse is acting
and you get the job. Nine dollars a week.

243
00:27:35,339 --> 00:27:40,976
If you do not mind doing
I give you a dream life.

244
00:27:42,588 --> 00:27:44,669
Come on.

245
00:27:47,986 --> 00:27:51,266
I can make a man 's degree is used.

246
00:27:53,502 --> 00:27:58,045
You are tired to talk
guys with no sense.

247
00:27:58,046 --> 00:28:00,105
Come on.

248
00:28:17,025 --> 00:28:19,293
Kinko.
- August.

249
00:28:19,294 --> 00:28:21,948
I got a roommate for you.
- What is it?

250
00:28:22,048 --> 00:28:25,007
Jacob Jankowski.
- I asked what, not whom.

251
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:27,728
He is our new vet.

252
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:32,095
Iveay League, thereby
He is estimated to be higher than you.

253
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:35,914
Maybe you want your bed to offer.

254
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,982
See you tomorrow morning.
Then we're talking about that horse.

255
00:28:44,552 --> 00:28:46,572
I had a Jack Russell.

256
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:49,287
He was smart.

257
00:28:50,114 --> 00:28:52,941
You get the bed.

258
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:58,996
May I introduce you to...
- Jacob Jankowski.

259
00:28:59,031 --> 00:29:03,011
Benzini Brothers' own vet.

260
00:29:03,602 --> 00:29:06,268
Is he the vet?

261
00:29:06,303 --> 00:29:09,096
That he studied at Cornell University.

262
00:29:11,965 --> 00:29:14,068
On the right front hoof.

263
00:29:15,335 --> 00:29:18,294
It's an abscess.
- Honey.

264
00:29:22,151 --> 00:29:25,515
In the show it looked not so bad off.
Do you need a star need?

265
00:29:25,516 --> 00:29:28,219
I do not think so.
- It is cold and heat.

266
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,767
And a salt link.
It'll be fine.

267
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:36,239
Come on, boy.
Help him to enter.

268
00:29:37,182 --> 00:29:40,174
Come on, boy.

269
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:47,857
Well?

270
00:29:48,877 --> 00:29:51,755
I wanted to say anything on her.

271
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:55,192
The horse has laminitis.
- In english.

272
00:29:57,032 --> 00:30:01,726
The connective tissue between
the hoof and the bone is inflamed.

273
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:05,099
If he is running, the bone
to allow the hoof.

274
00:30:05,951 --> 00:30:09,637
Until it is through.
- But not yet?

275
00:30:09,737 --> 00:30:13,055
No, but they will.

276
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:15,724
And he suffers much pain.
- How much time?

277
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:18,433
Two or three days.

278
00:30:18,681 --> 00:30:21,171
He must be completed.

279
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,311
You know all that by just
watch? Can you do anything?

280
00:30:27,312 --> 00:30:29,834
No, it's pretty serious.

281
00:30:31,253 --> 00:30:35,048
'M sorry.
- I appreciate it.

282
00:30:37,212 --> 00:30:40,657
Honey, Cornell agrees
with you that it is okay.

283
00:30:40,658 --> 00:30:44,484
Joe, Pete lets help Marlena.
- That will feed the tigers.

284
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,858
We are doing well.
You care for him.

285
00:30:54,442 --> 00:30:56,787
They each have a bucket.

286
00:30:58,143 --> 00:31:01,283
Are you sure this stuff they like?
It's already rotten.

287
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,600
They love goats.

288
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,480
The goats are all.

289
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:14,280
Start with Rex here in the middle.

290
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,200
Should I open the door
and throw it inside?

291
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,440
Unless you want to formally sit down?

292
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:35,280
Slow and quiet.

293
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,200
Then he notices that you're not.

294
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,680
Have they not learned in school?

295
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,520
Lay it gently.
Not throw.

296
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,880
You want to scare him.

297
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,560
Do you think that's funny?
- Yes.

298
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:18,280
I had lost my arm can be.
- Not true.

299
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:21,440
He has no teeth.

300
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,440
Does it hurt?

301
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,080
Something?

302
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,160
You wanted to finish my star?

303
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,040
No treatment, no need star,
Cornell only your courage.

304
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,480
You know what a circus survives?
You said it yourself.

305
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,040
Blood, sweat, pain and shit.

306
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,240
When the circus comes ill with food
animal waste. People eat anything.

307
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,560
Your heart goes out to the animals.
Very noble.

308
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:54,760
Very good, but you've obviously
people never suffer.

309
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:59,559
Before I get back from the city do
everything they have learned from you...

310
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,997
and you make sure that horse
ready for the parade.

311
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:05,880
Until we can walk
we give a performance.

312
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,800
It is not an abscess, is it?

313
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,080
He has an infection in his hoof.

314
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,160
It's okay, honey.

315
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:35,160
We had him from the show
should achieve.

316
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,440
It's not your fault.
It just happens.

317
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,840
It is not uncommon.

318
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,280
However, he suffers.

319
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:47,480
The pain is worse.

320
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,960
He would be killed.

321
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,920
That will not happen, do you?

322
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,920
Not if he has a few ideas
For August can do.

323
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:08,400
Here everyone works
to them under the ground.

324
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,840
He can only die if August says so.

325
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,920
And then August?
- I am a vet. It is my decision.

326
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,080
That's your last.

327
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,120
Just go.

328
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,600
No, I keep him quiet.

329
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,200
Good boy.

330
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,040
Okay?

331
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,120
It'll be fine.

332
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,800
Mr. Jankowski...

333
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,080
I will be sorry when you leave.

334
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:06,080
This circus, my circus
is a sovereign nation.

335
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,560
If you break my law,
you pay a price.

336
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,840
I tell you that your horse hoof
to heal.

337
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,200
Then you break my law.
The penalty is the red light.

338
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,554
You need to get out.
Only we do not stop.

339
00:37:17,654 --> 00:37:19,560
So unlikely that you survive.

340
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,133
Let me explain.
- Not required.

341
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,040
You took the initiative.
I respect that.

342
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:29,237
I keep the law.
Throw him.

343
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:33,640
Wait.

344
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,428
The only reason you are not permanent
forms part of the landscape...

345
00:37:46,528 --> 00:37:48,840
is that you might have avoided
that Marlena would get hurt.

346
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,880
And you have a big problem
solved for me.

347
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:54,560
You saw what we gave the tigers to eat.
That was not good.

348
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,227
Through them you will Silverstar
We provide fresh meat to sell tickets.

349
00:38:01,327 --> 00:38:03,244
You have my best song being killed.

350
00:38:03,344 --> 00:38:05,040
If we do not sell tickets
and the men are not paid...

351
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,080
they want someone to blame.

352
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,640
Welcome to the circus, Cornell.

353
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,000
In three cities, we had
cancel performances.

354
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,040
It was rumored that there are four men
were piloted to save money.

355
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,000
Then we might save.

356
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
We lost a lot of circuses in 1931.

357
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
The people were tired of being mistreated
be, so they revolted.

358
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,480
The directors saw the end approaching
and went with all the money away.

359
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:38,160
There were a lot of animals and performers around.
Bones that you could take.

360
00:38:38,195 --> 00:38:40,470
Fortunately we found one in Cochin.

361
00:38:40,505 --> 00:38:42,746
And August was all for a bargain.

362
00:38:42,846 --> 00:38:46,403
The rest of them would never
play a show.

363
00:38:46,438 --> 00:38:49,960
When I saw their faces I thought,
August is right.

364
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,640
I've never seen
people were hungry.

365
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,080
Honey, one moment please.

366
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,840
Erwin, here.
Joe, pour the champagne.

367
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,520
I want you all
the 'earthquake effect' experience...

368
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,759
from what I'm going to show you.

369
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,193
I have made a purchase which
The Gasoline Brothers are at the top.

370
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,617
Treasure.
- Yes?

371
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,981
Silver Star I can not really replace you,
but give me a chance to try it.

372
00:39:22,016 --> 00:39:25,344
You should not have to do.
- Joe the doors.

373
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,560
Kids, meet our salvation.

374
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,023
Here's a guaranteed sale.
Elephant acclaimed by the crowd.

375
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:36,240
Her name is Rosie.
She was 53.

376
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,800
And she's beautiful.
- What's in her mouth?

377
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,520
She ran away.
She was eating at a cemetery.

378
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,680
I'm going to invent a whole star attraction
around you and her.

379
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,120
Since I did not climb.
I've never ridden an elephant.

380
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:52,720
You did not know how to ride a galloping
horse to stand, until I showed up.

381
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,680
You learn fast.
This piece will be the highlight.

382
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,120
Where we let her?
- Make it instead.

383
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,920
How we pay her?

384
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,320
I pay the men just
a few weeks.

385
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,358
We've done it before.

386
00:40:05,393 --> 00:40:09,240
If we sell out, the men so much
money that they do not know what to do with them.

387
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,880
This is great.
I know.

388
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,960
Are you the olifantenman?
- He is my vet.

389
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,051
If you do not have olifantenman,
I must inform the municipality.

390
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:24,189
Otherwise I can not sell her.

391
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:29,083
I am the olifantenman.
- Say that then.

392
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:35,229
This beast is the dumbest beast
that God's good earth around.

393
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,320
Here's your stick elephants.
He will need you.

394
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,960
Success. An elephant dumber
I have never seen in my life.

395
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,440
Cornell, go look at her.

396
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,320
Jump to know.
You will write history.

397
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:10,480
He has gone mad.

398
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:15,680
You know how hard it is
to a new song to do?

399
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,920
My name is Jacob Jankowski.

400
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:25,560
Pleasant.
This is...

401
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,560
Marlena Rosenbluth.

402
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,805
You're a beauty.
Your skin is somewhat dry.

403
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:37,440
We need to do something. The first thing you
Notes on a woman her age is her skin.

404
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,400
Great. That is what we needed that.
Another alcoholic.

405
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,040
You're welcome.

406
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,840
Flirting as elephants?

407
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,440
Will you be alone?

408
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,440
I think she loves music.

409
00:42:15,814 --> 00:42:19,440
It's a beautiful song.

410
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:24,920
"I confess that I love you."

411
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,590
So hot that song.
- Of course.

412
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,360
Louis Armstrong.

413
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:38,958
It might as well be now.

414
00:42:39,058 --> 00:42:41,783
Climb it.
So jump into the deep.

415
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:45,600
Can you help me with this step?

416
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:48,600
August gave me bluntly
a monkey song.

417
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:53,270
The meanest monkeys you've ever seen.
They bit me during the entire performance.

418
00:42:53,305 --> 00:42:56,960
And I laugh and pretend it belonged.

419
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,960
I think it is very important to a band
to build off-piste around.

420
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,285
How do I look?
Stupid for sure.

421
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,200
No, you were made for each.

422
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:21,680
She is beautiful.

423
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,329
Mr. and Mrs. Rosenbluth invite you
for cocktails and dinner.

424
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:51,561
Come inside.

425
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,422
Glad you could come, Jacob.
To celebrate our beautiful new elephant.

426
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,640
Is something wrong?

427
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,280
I do not really have the right clothing.
- Nonsense, I told you already

428
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:20,480
Nothing but the best for our own
Cornell graduate vet...

429
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,440
what the bastards of Ringling
have not. I have checked.

430
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,280
I thought you ever could use new clothes.

431
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,000
And a shave.

432
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:37,320
My vet can not smell
to his patients.

433
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:44,148
Do you do that?
- Of course. Perfection.

434
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,680
When I started it was Benzini
this show is nothing but a scam.

435
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,120
And man could not walk straight
without having been robbed.

436
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,840
Benzini was an impostor.

437
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,720
He invested a cent
new songs.

438
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:02,840
When he stopped it, everybody thought
that was with us.

439
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,165
Not me.
- You were 19 right?

440
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,520
August sent all pickpockets
and crooks from office.

441
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:16,418
He sold two clowns and a wagon to
Lucinda, our beautiful colt now.

442
00:45:16,453 --> 00:45:17,760
And Rex.

443
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:23,153
You kept the dancers.
- Their earnings were convincing.

444
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,924
I needed money.

445
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:30,804
I had every bankrupt circus stripping
to every song that we have.

446
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:33,600
I do not have to buy.

447
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:37,720
With you I had married.
- That's right.

448
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:42,645
Were you an artist?
- August taught me everything I know now.

449
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:45,960
He said that on one day as large
would like the Ringling Brothers.

450
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,400
That damn brothers were brilliant.

451
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:55,200
That gave the family the idea that they show a
saw their mothers and sisters could see.

452
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,880
No sex, no scam.

453
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,868
Safe for children.
And no one could surpass their visitor.

454
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:05,000
But, we're on the right track.

455
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,120
That elephant should be spectacular.

456
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:14,360
I care for the show, now I have someone
needed that allows for the elephant.

457
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:16,447
August olifantenman want you to be.

458
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,720
You alone will train Rosie.
With increase in salary.

459
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,160
A modest increase in salary.
You notice you do not agree.

460
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,120
I know nothing about elephants.

461
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:26,360
Shall we tell him the truth?

462
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,926
A group of us will eat carcass
if we the people entry.

463
00:46:31,026 --> 00:46:37,392
And I mean a crowd on their feet
falls to us to come inside.

464
00:46:37,968 --> 00:46:43,850
That elephant must make. She has to.
- I gotta tell you something.

465
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,640
I do not know if you remember me familiar
after you have heard.

466
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:54,720
Cornell I've never finished.

467
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:59,830
I am not a real vet. I have
no diploma. I have no license.

468
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:12,480
Do you think Lucinda, the fat lady,
400 weighs?

469
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,720
Up to 200.

470
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:19,240
Do you think the lady her getatoerde
has tattoos of headhunters in Borneo?

471
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,640
She is from Pittsburgh.
Those tattoos, because she did about nine years.

472
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:25,480
Tell him about the hippo.

473
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,485
When she died, we did formaldehyde
in her water and let her see...

474
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:32,960
last two weeks we traveled
with a stuffed hippo.

475
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,440
The world is run with tricks.

476
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:39,200
Everyone plays.

477
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:45,320
It is a true talent.
A gift you can give a diploma.

478
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,280
You have such talent.

479
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,200
A Look at Silver Star and you knew it.

480
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,083
You must learn, dear boy...

481
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:59,725
that the rules of the 'United Bastards'
not apply to us.

482
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,600
On talent and illusion.

483
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,600
On Rosie.

484
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:13,040
On Rosie.
- In everyone we love.

485
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:46,480
Softly, dear.
We have a guest.

486
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:57,200
You squeeze too hard.

487
00:48:57,460 --> 00:49:02,436
I'm here.

488
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,760
Come to bed.

489
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:16,480
Excuse us, Jacob.

490
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:57,440
Is everything okay?
- Yes, he has too much to drink.

491
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,440
Bessie Smith.
I wish I was able to sing.

492
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,600
Should I leave?

493
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:06,680
No, I want to dance.

494
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:11,840
A dance, then you go home.

495
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,440
Was it fun tonight?

496
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:40,640
August can you really like.

497
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,320
He can use a friend.

498
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,480
We both.

499
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,560
That's a nice song.

500
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:03,560
"Tell him what happened."

501
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,599
No, I would never do.

502
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,720
So hot that song.
"Tell him what has happened to me."

503
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,200
That song?
- Yes.

504
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,000
Go ahead.

505
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,200
I think you should go.

506
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,320
Exactly.

507
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:53,040
Good night.

508
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,160
Bravo, Queenie.

509
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:25,399
This is my new friend...

510
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,655
and roommate, Jacob.

511
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:34,840
I want you all to ensure
that he feels at home.

512
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:40,440
I want you to feel at home.

513
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,640
Hello, beautiful.

514
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:29,920
What did I do last night?

515
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,200
You gave to Barbara.

516
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:38,480
Your balls itch?

517
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,840
Yes.

518
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,400
Thank you did.

519
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,760
It is growing again.
Bundles.

520
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:52,765
What happened to Queenie?
- Why?

521
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,320
She hates me anymore.
There is something wrong.

522
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,354
She must have eaten something wrong.
- Give her some honey from the kitchen...

523
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,440
and if you can some ground oak bark.

524
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:05,600
If that fails, we can tomorrow
see if they have parasites.

525
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,960
My real name is Walter.

526
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,080
Good morning.

527
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,160
I had forgotten how great you were.

528
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:30,920
Want to work?

529
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,560
Go easy on me today.
I'm not really in shape.

530
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,360
Do you want to walk?

531
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,800
Rough party I've heard.

532
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,960
The most I lost it.

533
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:56,960
The rest of those guys apparently do not.

534
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,094
About last night...
It was champagne.

535
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:08,645
What?
- You're not familiar with it.

536
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:14,320
If a woman tells you right in your face,
do not like you forget it.

537
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,760
Good.

538
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:20,240
I meant what I said
about friends.

539
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:29,720
What are you doing?

540
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,551
Good morning, children.
- Good morning, darling.

541
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:35,960
Where were you?
- I was early for her to practice.

542
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:39,480
Your charms seem to work well
to that yearning for love pachyderm.

543
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:42,240
Too bad they are with Barbara
not have worked well.

544
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,920
Barbara?

545
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:48,240
Rumor has it that you did not,
but you did it on his "Cornell's" tried.

546
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,800
Can we please continue?
- Of course.

547
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:56,280
Cornell, if you work with an elephant,
you need absolutely no charm.

548
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,960
Every living creature needs to know
who's the boss.

549
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:05,640
They smell when a man
power at its strongest.

550
00:56:05,840 --> 00:56:10,155
And if that is not.

551
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,461
First, you start anything with an elephant
Gaddafi stick.

552
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:28,920
And with that, you have the role of master
claim immediately.

553
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:35,480
You use it just above her shoulder.

554
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,560
You use a loud voice for the command.

555
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,680
Run.

556
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,800
Rosie, run.
- Put her.

557
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:57,880
They must know that you mean it.

558
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,720
Rosie, run.

559
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,240
Run. Come on.

560
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:13,560
Rosie, run.

561
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,800
Look at me.
Backwards.

562
00:59:49,600 --> 00:59:54,745
Ladies and gentlemen and children
of all ages.

563
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:58,480
Welcome to the most buitensporigste
extravagance...

564
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,720
that the human eye can comprehend.

565
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:04,582
Welcome the stars
The Benzini Brothers...

566
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:07,394
the most spectacular show in the world.

567
01:02:05,631 --> 01:02:09,249
Okay?
- I landed wrong on my heel.

568
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:12,428
Grab the elephant before we left the city
off. Forget elephants do not stick.

569
01:02:14,956 --> 01:02:17,152
The boys go into town.

570
01:02:17,776 --> 01:02:20,991
I'll help. Come on.

571
01:02:25,935 --> 01:02:30,758
Sorry.

572
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:33,363
Sorry.

573
01:02:34,331 --> 01:02:37,060
Is yours.
- We will be there for.

574
01:02:37,061 --> 01:02:40,135
Thanks.
- Pay my cabbage.

575
01:02:40,136 --> 01:02:43,632
They love to drink.

576
01:02:43,633 --> 01:02:47,141
One sip of this and she thinks
no more grain.

577
01:02:49,201 --> 01:02:53,433
This I got from Wade and Grady.
The master gives me enough.

578
01:02:54,327 --> 01:02:57,522
Pay, sir.
- I will.

579
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:01,699
That is wasted on such a pachyderm.

580
01:03:02,759 --> 01:03:05,440
My leg.

581
01:03:05,441 --> 01:03:09,906
Follow them?
- Yes.

582
01:03:09,907 --> 01:03:12,276
Good.

583
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:19,852
Okay?
- Fine. My joints hurt.

584
01:03:19,853 --> 01:03:22,167
A bruised heel.
It'll be fine.

585
01:03:22,817 --> 01:03:28,102
August wants to drink something.
You take some. To relax.

586
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:31,571
Did you catch that elephant?

587
01:03:32,199 --> 01:03:37,006
Eventually she got back in the car.

588
01:03:37,007 --> 01:03:39,268
Good.

589
01:03:46,165 --> 01:03:48,391
Do not.

590
01:03:50,913 --> 01:03:53,418
She did well.
She came back alone.

591
01:03:53,419 --> 01:03:55,845
She needs more time.
She was not ready.

592
01:04:17,105 --> 01:04:19,829
Stop.
- Stay down.

593
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:22,340
I mean it.

594
01:05:25,242 --> 01:05:27,783
You do need a lot of whiskey.

595
01:05:31,943 --> 01:05:35,446
I do not understand why such a man
near animals want to be.

596
01:05:36,115 --> 01:05:39,220
If you ask me he has no right.

597
01:06:02,110 --> 01:06:04,513
Marlena.

598
01:06:06,673 --> 01:06:09,924
Marlena has sent you?

599
01:06:09,925 --> 01:06:12,877
No.

600
01:06:12,878 --> 01:06:17,100
She does not see me.
She will not talk to me.

601
01:06:20,599 --> 01:06:22,819
This time she forgives me.

602
01:06:23,483 --> 01:06:26,525
Maybe you can talk to her?

603
01:06:30,017 --> 01:06:32,919
There is no excuse for what I did.

604
01:06:33,601 --> 01:06:36,631
Rosie is okay?
- She needed whiskey.

605
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:39,759
Here, take everything but what I have.

606
01:06:46,277 --> 01:06:49,721
Take it.
Do you want to tell Marlena.

607
01:06:50,307 --> 01:06:54,187
What?
- I saw her go up to the elephant...

608
01:06:54,188 --> 01:06:57,019
and run away with her,
then I lost my mind.

609
01:06:57,439 --> 01:07:00,308
I know this is no excuse.

610
01:07:07,126 --> 01:07:10,627
I've already spent the money to the elephant.

611
01:07:11,362 --> 01:07:14,646
I have to work with it.
I have to repay debts.

612
01:07:15,225 --> 01:07:18,551
I have to sell tickets.

613
01:07:18,552 --> 01:07:21,865
The elephant we can no longer use.

614
01:07:21,866 --> 01:07:24,891
Marlena If I lose, you lose
I get this all.

615
01:07:36,568 --> 01:07:39,265
What was your plan, stick with that elephant?

616
01:08:01,948 --> 01:08:03,932
Is this too much?
Soon she is drunk.

617
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,598
She weighs four tons.
She is just sleepy.

618
01:08:07,599 --> 01:08:10,985
They can thus have hardly move.
- It'll be fine.

619
01:08:15,579 --> 01:08:18,509
I do not know what to do.

620
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:21,528
The next time he will kill her.
- You can not do.

621
01:08:21,529 --> 01:08:26,144
Thus a man throws people off a moving train
so he does not have to pay.

622
01:08:26,145 --> 01:08:31,054
You'd think he think twice
God's innocent creatures to murder.

623
01:08:33,884 --> 01:08:38,238
Give me that other cloth at once.
Under your feet.

624
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:42,501
Put your leg up.

625
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:57,078
Read it aloud to Rosie.

626
01:09:12,602 --> 01:09:15,135
It helps if he "please" says.

627
01:09:16,208 --> 01:09:20,824
Say...

628
01:09:20,825 --> 01:09:24,052
What does this mean?
- Try it now but.

629
01:09:33,073 --> 01:09:35,728
Next.

630
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:11,216
In the only authentic miracle of success.

631
01:10:12,438 --> 01:10:15,877
This removes all sins.

632
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,199
Do not you think? Only the thought.
Put all things right.

633
01:10:21,247 --> 01:10:23,574
Anyway, on Rosie...

634
01:10:23,575 --> 01:10:30,163
our great big, beautiful
bullseye of a star.

635
01:10:34,428 --> 01:10:37,208
I still need more champagne.
- You got it.

636
01:10:37,209 --> 01:10:39,615
No, sit down.
It's my party.

637
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:50,296
It is good to see him like.

638
01:10:50,297 --> 01:10:53,556
Seems that from now on
only his pitches.

639
01:10:53,557 --> 01:10:56,296
You know how many star attractions we have
had to pack them?

640
01:10:56,842 --> 01:11:00,018
How much money we earned
and lost?

641
01:11:00,019 --> 01:11:02,930
Earned and lost.

642
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:06,840
Silver Star paid our new track.
Look what happened to him.

643
01:11:09,507 --> 01:11:12,388
Why do you do with him?

644
01:11:13,199 --> 01:11:16,056
I was born in a train.

645
01:11:16,057 --> 01:11:20,176
I lay wrapped in newspaper under
a chair in the Baltimore Ohio.

646
01:11:20,177 --> 01:11:22,462
I was only three days old.

647
01:11:22,463 --> 01:11:26,125
I grew up in foster care.
I always dreamed about who my parents were.

648
01:11:27,127 --> 01:11:31,907
When I was five, I did one year long
though my mother was an Appaloosa.

649
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:34,061
Really.

650
01:11:34,062 --> 01:11:39,167
And I had a foal.
I dreamed that when I was a girl.

651
01:11:40,731 --> 01:11:44,173
And one day I woke up
and then would run home.

652
01:11:46,154 --> 01:11:49,558
I was safer than in those stables
home I've ever been.

653
01:11:51,616 --> 01:11:55,315
Then came the circus in town.

654
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:59,016
And there were those six wonderful
black horses.

655
01:11:59,017 --> 01:12:01,260
Red tassels hanging in their manes.

656
01:12:02,002 --> 01:12:05,893
It was so beautiful.
August and went in front.

657
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:11,102
As soon as he looked at me, I knew
I never would live with strangers.

658
01:12:13,512 --> 01:12:16,307
So I got married.

659
01:12:16,308 --> 01:12:18,300
And where I finished?

660
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:21,829
In a train.
The only home I ever knew.

661
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:29,365
And you know I'm the star.

662
01:12:31,502 --> 01:12:35,738
Not there.
I have nothing.

663
01:12:35,739 --> 01:12:38,457
Just like everyone else.

664
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:43,047
You're a beautiful woman.
You deserve a wonderful life.

665
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:46,093
So it's just.

666
01:12:48,953 --> 01:12:51,861
Where were you when I was 17?

667
01:12:57,700 --> 01:13:00,300
Let's dance.

668
01:13:48,780 --> 01:13:51,140
Robbery.

669
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:56,460
Robbery.

670
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,020
Jacob.
- Hold it.

671
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:13,340
This way.

672
01:14:18,380 --> 01:14:20,140
You okay?
- That was close.

673
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:24,460
My stockings.
They are also of silk.

674
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,860
How do we find our way back?

675
01:14:31,020 --> 01:14:34,580
If we do not find it August?

676
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:38,500
We should probably go look for him.

677
01:15:11,180 --> 01:15:14,060
Follow me.

678
01:15:31,340 --> 01:15:34,100
I told myself to let her go.

679
01:15:34,260 --> 01:15:37,060
August to say that I lost
was in the crowd...

680
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:40,860
was the best.
The best for everyone.

681
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:43,980
I could not do it.

682
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:47,540
I convinced me that I had to stay
to protect Rosie.

683
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:52,220
In order to protect Marlena.
You could not trust August.

684
01:15:56,460 --> 01:16:01,020
The truth was that I might
The man who could not be trusted.

685
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,980
There is something wrong with Camel.

686
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,700
Hello, boy.

687
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:19,540
Nice to see you.

688
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:22,660
What is it?
- I do not know.

689
01:16:22,820 --> 01:16:27,180
I woke up this morning and
zwabberden my feet.

690
01:16:27,340 --> 01:16:30,620
I feel they are not good.

691
01:16:30,780 --> 01:16:35,412
That's not all.
There are also other things.

692
01:16:35,820 --> 01:16:38,860
Down there?
Things Men?

693
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:42,220
What is wrong with him?
- An alcohol leg.

694
01:16:42,380 --> 01:16:47,140
I've seen.
- Nonsense, doctor?

695
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,717
Plastids are installing it in...

696
01:16:49,817 --> 01:16:54,820
the loophole that Jamaican
ginger extracts are not sold as beverages.

697
01:16:54,980 --> 01:16:57,100
That stuff you should not drink.

698
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:00,340
What should I drink that shake
counter?

699
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:04,460
It is prohibition.
I'm not a millionaire.

700
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:08,140
Tomorrow we get paid.
We take care of drinks.

701
01:17:08,300 --> 01:17:12,333
Do not lie to him. You get paid.
Blackie has nine persons discharged.

702
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:14,676
That can not be true.

703
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:18,140
Nine men have disappeared
between Goshen and Weehawken.

704
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:21,700
We have not stopped.

705
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:24,860
Will he get better?

706
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,580
As Earl of Camel as Blackie sees it's over.

707
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:30,700
We need to keep him out of sight.

708
01:17:44,500 --> 01:17:48,260
About one week he may have legs
do not move.

709
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:52,705
He told me that he has a son,
in Reading.

710
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,620
We are about three weeks.

711
01:17:54,780 --> 01:17:57,260
He needed only three weeks.

712
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:02,780
Blackie and his men watch
not in my closet.

713
01:18:11,180 --> 01:18:13,420
Good morning.

714
01:18:15,660 --> 01:18:19,100
May I sit?
- Of course.

715
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,900
Can we talk confidentially?

716
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:31,900
Why? Is something wrong?

717
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:35,100
I wanted to apologize
for what happened last night.

718
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:38,580
What weird.
Why would you apologize?

719
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:41,300
You were not even there.

720
01:18:41,460 --> 01:18:45,260
August I have explained everything.
As far as I remember something.

721
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:48,540
With the champagne I'm not in his right mind.

722
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,780
There was a crowd.
They began to push.

723
01:18:51,940 --> 01:18:56,060
I fell and tore my stockings.

724
01:18:56,620 --> 01:18:58,740
Good morning, children.

725
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:02,780
That was quite an adventure last night.

726
01:19:03,060 --> 01:19:05,100
Thanks, Paulie.

727
01:19:05,260 --> 01:19:07,580
I do not have to pay bail for you.

728
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:09,660
How did you get home?

729
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:11,940
By ferry.
- Great.

730
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:14,820
And cheap.
Fine, man.

731
01:19:14,980 --> 01:19:18,140
I have slept last night.

732
01:19:20,780 --> 01:19:24,060
Thanks, honey.
- August, not in public.

733
01:19:24,220 --> 01:19:28,260
You have nothing to be ashamed.
Man and woman united in the marital bed.

734
01:19:28,420 --> 01:19:30,480
This is a sacred act.

735
01:19:30,620 --> 01:19:33,460
My Marlena has forgiven me.

736
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:37,180
The world looks good again.

737
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,820
No, in a circle.

738
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:01,140
Wonderful, Jacob.

739
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:07,540
I was really worried last night
to you two.

740
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:12,540
If something happens to Marlena...

741
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:16,020
if anyone hurt her or something,
or touch her but...

742
01:20:19,460 --> 01:20:21,660
I should not think.

743
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:24,300
Bring her back.

744
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,100
Up.

745
01:20:32,180 --> 01:20:35,100
If August already knew something about that night
could you not notice.

746
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,740
He seemed just to Rosie
to worry.

747
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:40,860
Out of love she played her role
without batting an eyelid.

748
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,780
We all did.

749
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:45,380
Everything was as it was before.

750
01:20:45,540 --> 01:20:48,100
So it seemed.

751
01:20:48,260 --> 01:20:50,300
But nothing was the same.

752
01:20:50,460 --> 01:20:52,620
August was again right.

753
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:56,140
Everything is an illusion.

754
01:22:50,260 --> 01:22:52,220
All seats were sold out.

755
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:54,220
August promised the men that he
would finally pay them.

756
01:22:54,380 --> 01:22:57,780
With interest if his debts
would be paid.

757
01:22:57,940 --> 01:23:01,100
Success of August had a new man
made, they all said.

758
01:23:01,260 --> 01:23:05,580
But, I looked at him and knew that
but it would be a matter of time.

759
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,860
The circus is nothing without its traditions.

760
01:23:18,020 --> 01:23:20,580
It's a family.
And as with any family...

761
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:26,840
when a new family member that is born must
celebrated. And we should be grateful.

762
01:23:27,300 --> 01:23:30,826
We were all busy
sold out performances.

763
01:23:30,926 --> 01:23:33,620
Praise the Lord.

764
01:23:36,940 --> 01:23:41,620
This morning, for the show,
I wish we were together.

765
01:23:42,540 --> 01:23:45,380
We do our eyes closed.

766
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:50,180
And we owe, who is there
also above for steering...

767
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:53,740
of desperate men to the track.

768
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:58,100
Because it was a happy day
When Jacob Jankowski...

769
01:23:58,260 --> 01:24:00,522
jumped on our train.

770
01:24:00,622 --> 01:24:05,580
It is because of his discovery,
the biggest star that we have...

771
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:08,780
in the history of
The Benzini Brothers.

772
01:24:12,900 --> 01:24:14,420
Therefore...

773
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:18,660
We welcome him officially welcome
in our family...

774
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,780
We do our eyes open...

775
01:24:20,940 --> 01:24:26,427
and we give him the traditional
Gasoline Brothers baptism.

776
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:54,220
Congratulations, Jacob.

777
01:24:57,180 --> 01:25:01,980
Rosie bring to my tent
and tell it to anyone.

778
01:25:16,580 --> 01:25:19,900
Where do you want her?

779
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,980
There. That's perfect.

780
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:25,020
I have a surprise for August
preparing.

781
01:25:25,180 --> 01:25:27,820
I've never been so happy having company.

782
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:30,452
Maybe we can Ringling Brothers
still repay.

783
01:25:32,780 --> 01:25:34,500
Do you need anything?

784
01:25:34,660 --> 01:25:37,500
No thanks.

785
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:42,100
A handkerchief.

786
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:50,820
What is this?
- For you. A surprise.

787
01:25:50,980 --> 01:25:54,500
Congratulations, honey.
- Thanks, honey.

788
01:25:54,660 --> 01:25:56,620
Where you going, Jacob?

789
01:25:56,780 --> 01:26:00,496
It's for you.
- Join us.

790
01:26:02,980 --> 01:26:05,620
Of course.

791
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:22,940
In August. A man who performed miracles
by making me a star.

792
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,660
Thanks.

793
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:29,660
Thank you both.

794
01:26:31,060 --> 01:26:34,380
Sorry I was so early and so
ruining the surprise.

795
01:26:34,540 --> 01:26:37,549
I can go outside again.
Then you have more time.

796
01:26:38,180 --> 01:26:42,900
Or better yet, I can raid 'call
and everyone will flee.

797
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:46,380
That's an idea for the show.
A new number.

798
01:26:47,220 --> 01:26:49,860
It goes like this.

799
01:26:50,020 --> 01:26:53,660
A first dance.
Two people.

800
01:26:53,820 --> 01:26:58,068
A remarkable young man, hopelessly
love with a woman beyond his reach...

801
01:26:58,168 --> 01:27:02,540
who plays games with his affection.

802
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:08,460
We start with a romantic melody
them on the dancefloor swing.

803
01:27:08,820 --> 01:27:11,940
He does his arms around her.

804
01:27:12,100 --> 01:27:15,300
He does his arms around her.

805
01:27:16,820 --> 01:27:20,836
Do me a favor.
I'm inspired.

806
01:27:21,130 --> 01:27:24,300
The public will love it.

807
01:27:27,024 --> 01:27:32,300
Now they look into each others eyes.

808
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:36,380
August...
- Look at him.

809
01:27:38,860 --> 01:27:42,260
She touches his cheek.

810
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:45,500
Puts her hand gently on his neck...

811
01:27:45,660 --> 01:27:48,820
and plays with his hair.

812
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:56,060
Always keeps her eyes on him.

813
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,240
Let him believe that it is his own.

814
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,800
He let his hand slide lower.

815
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:06,800
And lower, under her plea.

816
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:14,600
But, she gives him a blow.

817
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:18,560
As if to defend her honor
against that insolent Don Juan.

818
01:28:22,160 --> 01:28:25,767
The audience will love it.
They love the illusion.

819
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:27,920
They will never think that you do not honor
have to protect.

820
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:31,240
August, please.

821
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,240
It's funny how things
prove.

822
01:28:34,400 --> 01:28:37,560
I always knew what
kind of woman you really are.

823
01:28:37,720 --> 01:28:40,120
Sit in front of your dress.

824
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,520
To watch the parade.

825
01:28:42,680 --> 01:28:45,680
That little girl with eyes that do not
knew what to do.

826
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,480
With such a beautiful almost transparent skin.

827
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:53,360
Clear to me.
I could always see through.

828
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:57,200
I'm sorry that I say,
you're pretty ordinary.

829
01:28:57,360 --> 01:29:01,281
Marlena, we gotta go.
- Is this the plan?

830
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:04,290
You leave me for him?
- No.

831
01:29:04,390 --> 01:29:07,339
You must be special.
- Please, August.

832
01:29:07,440 --> 01:29:10,560
If he does nothing for you,
say that I should sack him.

833
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:12,360
Sack him.

834
01:29:12,520 --> 01:29:15,381
Tell me I Blackie and his men
on him to release him a lesson...

835
01:29:15,481 --> 01:29:19,040
so he does not touch my stuff.
- It's okay, Marlena.

836
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,960
Go away, Jacob.

837
01:29:22,120 --> 01:29:26,155
A disagreement in grades.

838
01:29:26,255 --> 01:29:30,440
Betrayal is beyond lust.
That sell your cards with.

839
01:29:30,480 --> 01:29:33,680
August, look at me.

840
01:29:33,840 --> 01:29:38,480
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here.

841
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:42,400
Do you want me to leave?
- No.

842
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:45,760
But, I'm your wife.
Not one of your things.

843
01:29:45,920 --> 01:29:48,520
Prove it.

844
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:55,823
Look at me.
There is nothing wrong. Can you hear me?

845
01:29:56,355 --> 01:30:00,280
I'm never leaving you.

846
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:14,760
An innocent woman would naturally
must not kneel.

847
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:18,440
You can not help it.

848
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:22,760
It is a habit for a woman like you.

849
01:30:51,280 --> 01:30:54,600
Baas, spectators.

850
01:31:01,568 --> 01:31:05,458
Go away, otherwise it will be much worse.

851
01:31:06,640 --> 01:31:09,680
I trade it off.

852
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:17,120
The only thing you now stay afloat
are spectators.

853
01:31:17,280 --> 01:31:19,560
August hatred witnesses.
- What did you do?

854
01:31:19,720 --> 01:31:23,760
I leave her with him.

855
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:27,000
Come back. Close the door.
- I must find her.

856
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:30,200
If you go outside, he shoots you down.
Nobody can stop him.

857
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:34,280
You just got fired.
So you're an intruder.

858
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,360
Is everything okay?

859
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:43,089
The girls learned that August Blackie
instructed...

860
01:31:43,090 --> 01:31:45,146
to follow you to go if we went riding.

861
01:31:45,181 --> 01:31:48,780
Make sure you're rid of the train.

862
01:32:00,660 --> 01:32:02,900
Hurry.

863
01:32:05,220 --> 01:32:07,940
We are not far from a hotel.

864
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:10,620
Stay no longer than one night.
- Come with me.

865
01:32:10,780 --> 01:32:14,740
You think there is nothing out there for you.
That is there. You just do not see it.

866
01:32:16,820 --> 01:32:19,943
You do not understand.
I can not. He finds me anyway.

867
01:32:20,043 --> 01:32:23,740
Marlena, there's a better life
that is for you.

868
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:26,217
Or that living with me or not.

869
01:32:26,460 --> 01:32:28,237
Whether you love me or not.

870
01:32:28,660 --> 01:32:31,180
It does not matter.

871
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:35,420
It must happen now.

872
01:35:33,980 --> 01:35:36,580
How long have I slept?

873
01:35:36,740 --> 01:35:39,700
We can not stay here.
We must continue.

874
01:35:39,820 --> 01:35:41,620
Do not worry.

875
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,100
We take the best first bus.

876
01:35:43,260 --> 01:35:46,817
We go to Ithaca, I exam...

877
01:35:46,917 --> 01:35:49,500
We tackle each job in
until I get my license.

878
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:52,140
Then we go to Ringling.

879
01:35:52,300 --> 01:35:54,140
You will not just at Ringling.

880
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:56,900
You can not just eat them.

881
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:59,820
Not if we offer ourselves as a team.

882
01:35:59,980 --> 01:36:03,420
You as an artist, I as a veterinarian.
Nice outfit.

883
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:06,860
Do you think they take?

884
01:36:07,020 --> 01:36:10,980
No.
- There's nobody on.

885
01:39:52,100 --> 01:39:57,366
Ladies and gentlemen. This way.
Follow my voice. Do not be shy.

886
01:39:57,466 --> 01:40:00,870
Enough time for the big show starts.

887
01:40:00,905 --> 01:40:03,620
Jacob, it's good.
I do not have much time.

888
01:40:04,460 --> 01:40:08,199
Where are Walter and Camel?
- They jumped off the train last night.

889
01:40:08,299 --> 01:40:11,378
August was crazy. He Blackie's men
all night search.

890
01:40:11,478 --> 01:40:15,060
Wade and Grady were lucky
and found Walter and Camel.

891
01:40:15,700 --> 01:40:18,460
They were on the rocks cases.

892
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:21,900
They did not make it.

893
01:40:24,340 --> 01:40:28,660
Wade and Grady take August to address.
I do not know how, but you have to leave.

894
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:31,980
I seem to matinee begins here.

895
01:40:32,140 --> 01:40:35,140
Then I go to town.
There will be a church or so.

896
01:40:35,300 --> 01:40:37,380
That is there.

897
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,372
You do your number.

898
01:40:39,472 --> 01:40:41,860
Come to me when the show starts.

899
01:40:42,020 --> 01:40:44,291
August will not know that you're gone for
the second song starts...

900
01:40:44,391 --> 01:40:47,260
so we have a lead.
- I gotta go.

901
01:40:47,420 --> 01:40:49,620
Promise me you will.

902
01:40:49,780 --> 01:40:53,900
Otherwise I'll get you.
I swear.

903
01:40:54,060 --> 01:40:56,380
I'll be there.

904
01:41:02,380 --> 01:41:04,020
I love you.

905
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:06,900
Ladies and Gentlemen
and children of all ages.

906
01:41:07,060 --> 01:41:11,268
Welcome the stars
the Benzini Brothers...

907
01:41:11,368 --> 01:41:15,180
most spectacular show in the world.

908
01:42:11,220 --> 01:42:14,540
Take Queenie.

909
01:42:15,046 --> 01:42:18,980
The tigers have escaped.

910
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:26,460
Official reports
August was trampled.

911
01:45:26,620 --> 01:45:30,380
Blackie was not seen when
Grady Wade and dragged him out of that tent.

912
01:45:30,540 --> 01:45:33,620
No one was accused of being
those animals from their cages had left.

913
01:45:33,780 --> 01:45:37,580
According to police, it could be anyone.

914
01:45:45,140 --> 01:45:49,780
The Benzini Brothers were officially bankrupt.
Ownership of Altona Pennsylvania.

915
01:45:49,940 --> 01:45:54,460
The other smell that soon enough circuses
and then take our remnants along.

916
01:45:54,620 --> 01:46:00,060
I would not expose Rosie.
Nobody would ever have her touch the stick.

917
01:46:00,540 --> 01:46:03,300
As I was going, I did my exam...

918
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:09,483
and my diploma was a Ringling
nice thing with our animals and Marlena's number.

919
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:13,948
Our first son was born that season.
Walter.

920
01:46:14,860 --> 01:46:20,420
He spent his first seven years
at Ringling by, so I can not...

921
01:46:20,580 --> 01:46:24,060
understand why he did today
not come.

922
01:46:24,220 --> 01:46:26,493
There was a circus in town.

923
01:46:26,593 --> 01:46:29,170
By the time our third son
was born, we had enough.

924
01:46:29,905 --> 01:46:31,410
Rosie retired.

925
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:34,563
Luckily the vet to
the Albany zoo death...

926
01:46:34,564 --> 01:46:36,710
So I got that job.

927
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:43,200
We bought some land. The horses could
keep Rosie and five children.

928
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:47,033
Before you know it, the kids borrowing
the car and leave.

929
01:46:47,120 --> 01:46:50,800
When we were alone with Rosie.

930
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:56,720
When Rosie died...

931
01:46:57,300 --> 01:47:01,100
Marlena cried for days.

932
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:05,220
We had our whole life thanks to Rosie.

933
01:47:05,380 --> 01:47:07,980
And Marlena?

934
01:47:10,780 --> 01:47:14,460
Marlena is dead in her bed.

935
01:47:15,780 --> 01:47:18,540
Still beautiful.

936
01:47:27,620 --> 01:47:29,820
We have been together many years.

937
01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:34,740
I do not know how, but I find everything
given what I had ever promised.

938
01:47:34,900 --> 01:47:38,540
And boy, that was life.

939
01:47:38,700 --> 01:47:41,540
I tell you.

940
01:47:45,700 --> 01:47:49,020
You take me?

941
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:52,580
I do not know.
What about your health?

942
01:47:52,740 --> 01:47:55,260
Nothing wrong with me.
I'm just old.

943
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:58,020
Work is the best against old age.

944
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,580
A man like me to work
at a cash register...

945
01:48:00,740 --> 01:48:03,831
not trapped
like a freak show.

946
01:48:04,540 --> 01:48:08,420
If you think that I can not cost
deserve, call it home then.

947
01:48:08,580 --> 01:48:11,340
They will not argue.

948
01:48:11,500 --> 01:48:14,380
You will not regret it.

949
01:48:15,140 --> 01:48:19,940
We have put you in the record book.
The oldest man who ran away with the circus.

950
01:48:20,100 --> 01:48:22,820
I'm not running.

951
01:48:25,300 --> 01:48:28,380
I come home.

952
01:49:19,047 --> 01:49:23,752
