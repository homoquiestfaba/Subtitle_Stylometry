1
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,160
(panting)

2
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,040
(rattling)

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,680
(clock ticking)

4
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,240
(screaming)

5
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,440
- Jane! Jane! It's Momma.

6
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,320
(screaming)
Look at me!

7
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,440
J-Jane. Jane.

8
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,200
- No! No!

9
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:57,400
(panting)

10
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,000
- Oh, thank God.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,600
D'you have another nightmare,
honey?

12
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,560
Let's get you
into a nice hot bath, huh?

13
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,080
- Can I do it later? Please?

14
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:12,640
- All right.
But you have to get ready

15
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,200
for your father.
It's his weekend with you.

16
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,240
- I know. I know.

17
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,800
- What's this?

18
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
- I found it in the attic.

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,640
- Honey, you know
the attic's off-limits.

20
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,080
- Sorry.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,760
- Just don't do it again, okay?

22
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
I know how you feel.

23
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,280
<i>- November 1848.</i>

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,560
<i>I hoped that no one
would ever find cause</i>

25
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,960
<i>to open this letter.
If you have,</i>

26
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,880
<i>I must assume
that unexplained...</i>

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,320
<i>or even supernatural events</i>

28
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,880
<i>have begun to occur.</i>

29
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,000
<i>The story of the Bell witch</i>

30
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,720
<i>had always been considered
to be a tall tale.</i>

31
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,000
(laughter)

32
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,480
<i>This is not so.</i>

33
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,640
<i>Please, read this journal
with great care...</i>

34
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>... for its contents
may save your life.</i>

35
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,400
- Now where are you gonna go?

36
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,880
Just one kiss.
- No, Joshua.

37
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,080
- Leave that young lady alone.

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,400
(laughter)

39
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,000
Did he try to kiss you again?

40
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
- Isn't there something
you should be doing, Miss Bell?

41
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,640
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mother.
I was thinking about something else...

42
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,280
- Probably about torturing poor Joshua.

43
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,240
You really should be nicer to him,
Betsy.

44
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,960
- A woman must keep a man
on his toes at all times.

45
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
Isn't that what you taught me?

46
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,800
- I taught you no such thing,
Betsy Bell.

47
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
- I'm gonna make Joshua

48
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,360
love me forever.

49
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,280
- Well, then you better
stop mistreating him.

50
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,560
- You think I was too hard on him?

51
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
- Just a little bit.

52
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,720
- What would I do without you?
- Oh, you'd just shrivel up

53
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,480
and blow away.
Now, don't forget your schoolwork.

54
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,760
- I won't!

55
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,040
(children laughing)
- Good evening, sir.

56
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,960
- My hat, thank you.

57
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,240
Ah.

58
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,720
(jig music playing)

59
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,400
...then James Johnson grabbed it,
swallowed a swig of it,

60
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,320
wiped his mouth,

61
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,480
then he took hold of the wheel
at the axle

62
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,880
and in an instant, that carriage
was up and and out of that snowbank

63
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,440
as if 10 men had had a hold of it.
Ten! Ten!

64
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,360
- Speak of the devil!

65
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,560
I thought you'd gotten lost!
- I'm not stewed

66
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,560
that I can't find
the fob next door.

67
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,000
- I was telling them about you
and that carriage last winter.

68
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,400
- Ha-ha! I did...
- Not yet!

69
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:05,920
...that carriage!

70
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,440
- With the help
of a good swig of horse liniment.

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,440
- Who has the drink?

72
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,480
- You're three sheets to the wind
already.

73
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
(children giggling)

74
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,160
- I'm so sorry, Professor Powell.
- It's all right.

75
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,760
They're just having fun.

76
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:23,000
(laughter)
- Theny!

77
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,720
- Is there not a... tradition
connected to mistletoe,

78
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,800
Professor Powell?
- Well...

79
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,400
(John laughing)
- Yes, but...

80
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,080
- Elizabeth Bell,
it's not appropriate

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,120
for a student to place a teacher
in such a compromising situation.

82
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,520
You know better than that, precious.
- Well...

83
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,920
it is Christmas, Father.

84
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
And I am simply attempting
to learn the traditions.

85
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
Who better to learn from
than one's teacher?

86
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,240
- My prize pupil always seems

87
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,560
to have a ready answer
for everything, John.

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,000
Would you settle
for a dance, Betsy?

89
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,840
- Oh, John,
let them have their dance.

90
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
- May I steal this Bell
for a dance?

91
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,800
(Mrs. Bell laughing)
I promise not to step on your toes.

92
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,320
(sobbing)

93
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,720
- John!

94
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,120
(rapid thumping)

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,800
(moaning sound)

96
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,680
(quick sobbing sound)

97
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,400
(child crying)

98
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,720
(rapid thumping)

99
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,440
(gasping)

100
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,440
John...

101
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,200
I heard noises on the roof.
- It's coming from the attic.

102
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
(pattering)

103
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,520
- Squirrels?

104
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,280
- No, it's too loud for squirrels.
(running footsteps)

105
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,120
It's the third time I've heard it

106
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,000
in as many nights.
- I hadn't heard it.

107
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
- You sleep so sound,

108
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,000
you don't even feel me
get out of bed.

109
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,240
- Yes, I do.

110
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,960
(wind blowing softly)

111
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,440
Listen.

112
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,440
It stopped.
- Yeah.

113
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,520
- What was it?

114
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,160
- Probably that witch trying
to wear me out before tomorrow's trial.

115
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,280
- Oh, bite your tongue, John Bell!

116
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,960
(creaking)

117
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,000
(soft breathing)

118
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,640
<i>- Man's a lyin'pig!
- Miss Batts!</i>

119
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,920
<i>- Stole my land!
(pounding)</i>

120
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,920
<i>- Miss Batts,</i>

121
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,400
we have heard

122
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
your side of the story.

123
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,840
Please allow John Bell
to finish his.

124
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,240
- So, we offered her the use
of our slave, Samuel,

125
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,960
and the loan of $100

126
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,880
in exchange for our use
of that small piece of her land

127
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,680
that abuts our own.
- At 20% interest!

128
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,240
(gavel pounding)
- We shook on it!

129
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,680
- Oh!
- Spit and shook,

130
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,920
I gave you two harvests to pay

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,440
and you didn't pay for it,
so you forfeited the land.

132
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,520
(gavel pounding)
It was a fair price for it.

133
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,400
- Twenty-percent interest?

134
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,680
- Well...

135
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,560
it seemed like a reasonable charge
under the circumstances,

136
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,880
given her reputation.

137
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,520
- John Bell,

138
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,440
you broke church law.

139
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,560
Twenty-percent interest...

140
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,760
...under church canon...

141
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,960
...is usury.

142
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,160
Miss Batts's land
will be returned to her.

143
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,480
- What about my timber?
He took it off my land and sold it!

144
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,800
- You would not have allowed

145
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,400
the cutting of the wood
had you not received that money

146
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,160
and the use of the slave.

147
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,680
- But he broke church law.

148
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,400
- You have the $100
and Samuel.

149
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,000
The profit on the land
is John Bell's.

150
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,000
His loss,

151
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,920
the loss of his good name...

152
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,360
...is punishment enough.

153
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,160
- That's not fair!

154
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,520
<i>That's their punishment for you,</i>

155
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,240
John Bell.

156
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,320
Just wait until you see mine.

157
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,440
- Witchery can't touch me, woman.

158
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,040
- Treasure your land,

159
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,200
health and happy family

160
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,840
while you can.

161
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,480
For I swear,

162
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:44,120
dreadful darkness
will fall upon you.

163
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,880
You...

164
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,760
...and your precious daughter too.

165
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,200
<i>- Kate Batts...</i>

166
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,680
<i>... well, she was feared
by everyone in the village.</i>

167
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,880
<i>They were all convinced
she was a witch.</i>

168
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,040
<i>So the Bells took her cursing them
very seriously.</i>

169
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,400
<i>At the time,</i>

170
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,440
<i>I didn't believe in curses,
ghosts or spirits.</i>

171
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,520
<i>I do now.</i>

172
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,160
- John.

173
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,760
- Father, you all right?

174
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,000
- Yeah.

175
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,840
- We got it, Father.
- The wolf?

176
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,600
- Wolf?

177
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,200
We shot a deer.

178
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,440
Come see it, Father.

179
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,640
(low growling)

180
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,240
Father!

181
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,800
- I heard it.

182
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,080
- Back there.

183
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,760
(low growling)

184
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,280
(growling)

185
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,560
- Keep your eyes peeled,
it's black as night.

186
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,840
(growling)

187
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,080
(growling)

188
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,960
(snarling)

189
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,160
(growling)

190
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:24,920
(thumping)

191
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,640
(young boy):
Momma! Momma! Momma!

192
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,360
- Oh, let me hold you.

193
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,760
(panting)

194
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,760
(banging)

195
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,880
(growling)

196
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,320
(panting)

197
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,360
(growling)

198
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,280
(crashing)

199
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
- Betsy, what was that crash?
- Mother, there's something in my room!

200
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,880
There's something in my room!

201
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,000
- Oh, the wind blew the window open.
I'll close it.

202
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,440
- No! There's something in here.

203
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
It got inside.

204
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,520
- Well, there doesn't seem
to be anything in here now, Betsy.

205
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,440
It was probably just mice, darling.

206
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,160
- I don't think so, Mother.

207
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,840
- Let's go find your brothers.

208
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,160
Come along.

209
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,800
(snarling)

210
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,480
Let's go find that big, scary mouse!
(boys): Yeah!

211
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,760
(footsteps)

212
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,440
(door creaking)

213
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,560
- Everyone all right?

214
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,040
- We're fine.

215
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,600
Let's get back to bed.

216
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,600
<i>You could have killed us.</i>

217
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,320
- Yeah, it was young John.

218
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,520
- He shot a musket into the house.
- It discharged accidentally.

219
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,600
- He shot a musket
into the house, John!

220
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,320
- We were taken aback.

221
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,320
I can't get Kate Batts
out of my head.

222
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,680
<i>- What's done is done!</i>

223
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,680
<i>The church has had its say
and that's that,</i>

224
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,120
<i>so just put it out of your mind!</i>

225
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,120
(whispering sound, building)

226
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,040
(eerie music)

227
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,080
(eerie, discordant sounds)

228
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,360
- Now, class,
who were the couriers

229
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,840
ordered to ride to Concord
to warn that the British were coming?

230
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,400
Yes, Theny.
- Paul Revere,

231
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,120
Samuel Prescott and William Dawes.
- Right, Theny.

232
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,240
And did they succeed, Betsy?

233
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,280
Betsy?

234
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,760
All right, class,
let's leave this for a moment.

235
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,160
It's time for your physical exercise
anyway. Fifteen minutes now!

236
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,240
Fifteen minutes only.

237
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,680
You all right, Betsy?

238
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,080
- I'm tired.

239
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,040
Our house makes...
strange noises at night.

240
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,880
It's hard to sleep.

241
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,000
(child): Pass it to me, quick!

242
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,760
(creaking)

243
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,200
(creaking)

244
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,240
- Betsy!
- Betsy? You hurt?

245
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,920
- W-where'd she go?
- Who?

246
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,160
- The girl who was swinging with me.

247
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,080
- You were swinging alone, Betsy.

248
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,760
(crying)

249
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,680
- Did you see a girl?
- No.

250
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,040
("screaming")

251
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,480
(clomping)

252
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,760
(creaking)

253
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:30,040
(creaking)

254
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,200
(creaking)

255
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,800
(gasping)

256
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,840
(panting)

257
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,960
(blowing sound)

258
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,920
(heavy-breathing sound)

259
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,040
(screaming)

260
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,200
- Betsy! I'm here, darling.
- Momma! Momma!!!

261
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,760
Momma!!!!!!!! Momma!!!!!!!!!!
- It's me! Betsy!

262
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,880
- Momma!!!!!!!!!!!
- Betsy, Momma's here!

263
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,200
- Momma!!!!!
(John): Betsy!!

264
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,800
Betsy! Betsy.

265
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,200
- It touched me.
- Where?!

266
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,560
Who touched you?
- I don't know.

267
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
I couldn't see.

268
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,080
(John exclaiming)
- It was just a bad dream, darling.

269
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,840
- But it was so real.

270
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,960
- It's all right, John.

271
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,920
She's had a bad dream.

272
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,720
- Let's just get you back to sleep.

273
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:45,720
It was just a dream.

274
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,680
- It wasn't a dream.

275
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,600
There was someone on the roof.
- What?

276
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,400
- I think maybe Kate Batts
sent one of her slaves to torment us.

277
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,880
When I find him...
- John!

278
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,120
...I'll whip him
to within an inch of his life!

279
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,520
- My God.
- What?

280
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,480
- John, look at this.

281
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,840
- That sonofabitch!

282
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,960
- John!

283
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,080
John!!

284
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,520
John... Wait.

285
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,040
John!

286
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,600
Stop. We don't know
who did this!

287
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,160
- I know who did this!
- You don't!

288
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,360
Listen to me!
- Batts is not gonna hurt my daughter.

289
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
- Oh, go on, then! Be a fool!

290
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,520
- What are the two foundations
of any civilized community?

291
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:29,400
- Church and...
- Church and education, that's what.

292
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,600
And this man pioneered them both
for our community,

293
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,160
with his money and with his hands.

294
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,560
- He built the church
and the church condemns him.

295
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,960
- Usury. I broke church law.

296
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,040
- But, Father...
- Moral turpitude.

297
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,280
- Moral turpitude, pah!

298
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,240
He charged a rate of interest

299
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,120
<i>that was just a little higher
than church canon.</i>

300
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,400
But what the elder didn't realize
was who he was dealing with!

301
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,840
- Shhh, James.

302
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,080
The boys are finally asleep.

303
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,640
- Th-that's good. Bless their...

304
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,800
Now, a few chapters...

305
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,480
from the Bible

306
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,680
will take care
of this house's troubles.

307
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,160
- Quietly, James.

308
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,400
- "Hannah prayed and said,

309
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,600
"'My heart exalts in the Lord...

310
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,160
"My mouth is enlarged
over mine enemies... '

311
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:22,760
"'Who am I?
An untamed spirit that spoke to him

312
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:25,400
"and Jesus answered,

313
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,680
"'Be silent

314
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,040
"and come out of there.'

315
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,440
"The spirit gave a loud cry

316
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,240
and departed."

317
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,120
Please...

318
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,600
all join hands.

319
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,640
As one,
we shall speak this prayer

320
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,040
three times.

321
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,160
Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ,

322
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,520
be silent

323
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,040
and leave this house forever.

324
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,400
(all): Demon,
in the name of Jesus Christ,

325
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,160
be silent

326
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,880
and leave this house forever.

327
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,120
Demon, in the name

328
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,880
of Jesus Christ,

329
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,640
be silent
and leave this house forever.

330
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,360
Demon, in the name of Jesus Christ,

331
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,120
be silent
and leave this house forever.

332
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,640
(thunder)

333
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,600
Almost 12:00

334
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,120
and all is well.

335
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,400
I believe your home is safe.

336
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,040
- I'm sure Kate Batts
is at the root

337
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,240
of these disturbances.
- Yeah.

338
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,400
- A few nights ago,

339
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,880
I saw something.

340
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,800
A man, I think.

341
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,480
Moving about the property.

342
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
- Who was he?

343
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,240
- Couldn't make out for sure.

344
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,280
- Was probably the professor.
He's the only one who lives nearby.

345
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,600
- You don't think Richard
has his eye on Betsy, do you?

346
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,040
- He's her teacher,
for goodness sake.

347
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,960
(clock chiming)

348
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,520
Hallelujah, Lucy.

349
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:05,320
God has answered.

350
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,680
It's midnight
and your house is quiet.

351
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,000
- Thank you, James.

352
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:13,080
- I beat him, Lucy.
- Oh, did you?

353
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,360
(laughing)

354
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,680
Oh, good night, all.
- Good night, dear.

355
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,640
- Good night.
Now, I wasn't looking, John.

356
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,400
I was talking to your wife.
That game don't count.

357
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,920
- Don't you blame that on me!

358
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,240
(James laughing)
- I'll set for another one.

359
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,920
- Ain't gonna play
if you're gonna cheat.

360
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
- I never cheat.

361
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,040
My move.

362
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,080
(rattling)

363
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,120
(panting)

364
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,600
(screaming)

365
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,440
(panting)

366
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:08,440
(screaming)

367
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,200
- Ahhhh! Dad! Daddy!!

368
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,400
(screaming)

369
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,360
- Open the door!
(John shouting)

370
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,360
(Betsy screaming)

371
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,640
(Lucy): Betsy!!!

372
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,720
(John): Open the door!!

373
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,200
(slapping sound)
(screaming)

374
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,160
- Help me!!!!!!

375
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,240
Help me!!!!! Help!!!!!!!

376
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,600
- In the name of Jesus Christ,

377
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,320
cease this at once!

378
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,520
(John): Oh...
- It's all right.

379
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,920
(shrieking)

380
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:12,840
- Demon, ghost,

381
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,560
entity - call it what you will,

382
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,920
it is not natural.
- James, James,

383
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,400
listen to yourself.
You're not being realistic.

384
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,160
(James sputtering)

385
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,520
There must be a rational explanation.

386
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,800
- Listen, Richard,

387
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,520
I have documented evidence.

388
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,040
It's the testimony
of Joan Jordan

389
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,520
at the witch trial

390
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,440
of Olive Barthram,
Suffolk Assizes,

391
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,840
of 1599.

392
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,200
First,

393
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,360
scraping on the walls.

394
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,480
Then, knocking.

395
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,080
After that, shuffling.

396
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,160
And then, it clapped the maid

397
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,400
on the cheek...

398
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,040
half-a-score times.

399
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,360
- Do you not think

400
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,080
it is far more likely

401
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,480
that Kate Batts,
unhappy with the ruling,

402
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,600
has sent her slaves to exact
a pound of flesh from you?

403
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,800
- Well, that's what I thought,

404
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,800
but this was not the work of slaves.

405
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:06,560
- Lord, no!
She was dangling there!

406
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,760
Two feet off the ground!

407
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,080
- All right.

408
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,360
The incidents
always happen at night

409
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,080
and always in Betsy's room.
Correct?

410
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,360
- That's right, Professor.
- So it was dark.

411
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:24,240
Well, it would've been quite easy
for you not to have seen

412
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,800
someone holding her.
- She was suspended in midair

413
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,080
by something not of this Earth!
- John!

414
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,000
Now, the only logical explanation
is that someone was holding her.

415
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,000
- There was nobody in that room.

416
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,720
- And what about the door?

417
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,040
The strength of three of us
couldn't budge it.

418
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,720
- Well...

419
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,280
the rain that night
could've cause the door to swell.

420
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,880
- It could've.

421
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,760
- And the slaps?

422
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,680
How did we imagine them?

423
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,480
- Now, that's a boy's trick.

424
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,280
Dried peas
blown through a hollow reed.

425
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,400
- A pea shooter?

426
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,760
- Huh!
- No pea shooter

427
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,120
could smack her face

428
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,320
that violently.

429
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,640
- Did you actually see
someone slapping her?

430
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,360
- No, I saw her being slapped.

431
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,840
- But you did not see
someone slapping her?

432
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,240
- No, that's the point.
- So it stands to reason

433
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,560
you may also not have seen
someone holding her.

434
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,400
Now, whatever happened,

435
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,280
it's very clear
that confusion was about that room.

436
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:25,200
- Professor, we did not all imagine
the same thing.

437
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,280
- There was something unholy

438
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,360
in that room.
- John...

439
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,200
...when the school week is over,

440
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,680
I will come and spend the night
at your house

441
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,520
and I will prove to you
that this is nothing more

442
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,640
than someone
trying to frighten you.

443
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,600
(bell tinkling)
All right, time's up, class.

444
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,920
Leave your slates
on my desk, please.

445
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,480
- Betsy.

446
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,160
Hurry up.

447
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,560
We gotta get to the river
before it gets dark.

448
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,320
- Not today, Joshua.

449
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,560
- We've been planning this for weeks.

450
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,800
- I just don't feel like it.

451
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,040
- Come on, Betsy.
- I said no!

452
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,880
Leave me alone!

453
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

454
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,480
<i>- This will pass, Betsy.</i>

455
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,960
(screaming)

456
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,720
- Why?

457
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,840
Why?

458
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,680
(child): Give that back!

459
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,880
(gasping)

460
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,440
- Remember what?

461
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,000
(ominous music)

462
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,520
(door creaking)

463
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
(creaking)

464
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,840
(panting)

465
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,640
- No!

466
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,880
No.

467
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,280
(banging)

468
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,640
Shhh!
- No, no!

469
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,200
- No! Don't!

470
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,720
(John): Lucy, what's happening?!

471
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,000
(Lucy): What's happening?

472
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,120
- Richard, you should not be watching.
- Somebody wake her!

473
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,240
- Oh!
- John!

474
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,200
(door creaking)

475
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,960
(water pouring)

476
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,520
- Open your eyes, John.

477
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,920
- He'll be all right in the head
come morning, Miss Bell.

478
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,360
- And the poultice?

479
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,600
- He keep them roots
on his head a while.

480
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:21,080
- Well...

481
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,560
Betsy appears to suffer
from violent nightmares.

482
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,200
- Did you see my sister?

483
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,880
- Of course.
- You think what my daughter

484
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,160
just went through...
- Bear with me

485
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,760
for a minute here...
- The covers were pulled off her bed!

486
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,080
That was no nightmare.

487
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,160
- Nightmares may appear
to be more than they are.

488
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,200
People often imagine

489
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,200
they've seen...
- We didn't imagine any of this!

490
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,560
You were there, you saw it!

491
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,360
It was not natural!
- There's something evil here.

492
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,800
- This is blasphemy!

493
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,160
- Who's there?

494
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:58,360
Show yourself!

495
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,120
- Betsy, is that you?

496
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,760
- Destroy them, O Lord!

497
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,720
Let them fall by their own counsel!

498
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,400
- Quiet, James!

499
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,760
- Destroy them! Destroy them!

500
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,360
Cast them out!
- Can you see anyone?

501
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,160
- A multitude of their...
- Who is that?

502
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,040
- O Lord,
they have rebelled against thee!

503
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,000
Cast them out!
- Stop that, James!

504
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:23,960
- The foolish shall not stand!

505
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,840
They shall not stand

506
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,320
in thy sight!

507
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,080
Cast them out! Cast them...

508
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,800
Stop it!!

509
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,920
Damn you to hell!!

510
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,760
- Are you familiar
with that which Mr. Johnson reads?

511
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,360
- Of course it understands
the words of the Lord.

512
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,120
That's why it's gone.

513
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,360
(noise)

514
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:09,760
- Was the reading
from the Gospel According to Matthew?

515
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,680
(noise)

516
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,600
- Was that a yes...

517
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,080
or a no?

518
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,440
- Shhh!

519
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,560
The Gospel According to Mark?

520
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,720
(noise)

521
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,880
- Is it a Psalm of David?

522
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,480
(loud noise)

523
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,840
Why are you here?

524
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,720
Have the Bells disturbed you?

525
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,240
- Are we all having nightmares now,
Professor?

526
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,400
- My mess. I'll clean it.

527
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,920
(knocking)

528
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,840
- Anky, could you answer
the door, please?

529
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:00,280
- Yes, ma'am.

530
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,960
- Hi, Anky.
- Zach.

531
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,280
What you doing here?

532
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,640
- Miss Batts told me

533
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:12,920
to bring this bag to the Bells.
She say she found it on her land.

534
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,800
Bye, Anky.
- Bye, Zach.

535
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:21,720
- Who was it, Anky?

536
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,240
- It was Zach, ma'am.

537
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,360
- Who works for Kate Batts?
- Yes'm.

538
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:28,120
She give him this bag
to give to you.

539
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,520
- I don't want anything of hers
brought into this house.

540
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:33,080
- She say it belong
to the Bell family.

541
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,600
- No, Mom.

542
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:52,960
- This is Betsy's.
- Yes, Miss Lucy.

543
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,960
And that be Mr. Bell's shirt.

544
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:58,920
They's been missing for over a year.
- Why would she have their clothes?

545
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:07,520
What is it, Chloe?

546
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,920
What do you know?

547
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,120
Tell me what you know.

548
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:16,520
- You heard about Miss Kate
being a witch and all.

549
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,480
Well, Miss Lucy,

550
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,400
when witches
get a critter's blood on folks' clothes,

551
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,160
why, that mean

552
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,440
the person gonna...

553
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,920
- Gonna what, Chloe?

554
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,320
Gonna what?

555
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,360
- Gonna...

556
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,760
Gonna die, Miss Lucy!

557
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,960
Gonna die!

558
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:40,680
- I'll burn it!!

559
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:41,960
- No, Miss Lucy!!

560
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:44,120
That'll make it worse.

561
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,720
They're gonna let the devil in!

562
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:51,560
(eerie music)

563
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,720
(children shouting)

564
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,080
- Hey, come on, come on!

565
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,720
Hey, give it back!

566
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,800
("angelic" music)

567
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,920
- Stop! Wait!

568
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:44,000
Please, stop!

569
00:48:13,480 --> 00:48:14,840
(water dripping)

570
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,760
(screaming)

571
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,040
- You're having a nightmare!

572
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,440
(breathing heavily)

573
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:17,720
It's all right.

574
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,480
It's all right.

575
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,040
It's all right.

576
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:29,720
What happened?

577
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,160
- I don't remember.

578
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,040
I never remember.

579
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:37,240
- Should I wake your parents?
- No!

580
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,400
Please.
Please just stay here with me.

581
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:42,840
- Of course, Betsy.

582
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:48,600
Let's get you covered up.

583
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,760
(coughing)

584
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,880
- John!

585
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:23,400
- I'll kill her. I'll kill her!
- No, John.

586
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,680
<i>When they hang you for her murder,
what happens to us?</i>

587
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,160
- You won't be any worse off

588
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,840
than you are already...

589
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,320
- John, I want to have you,
John Bell!

590
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:33,080
- But sacrificing my life
could end this torment!

591
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,520
(coughing)

592
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,720
- We'll find another way, John.

593
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,640
We'll find another way.

594
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:48,760
- Theny?

595
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,200
- Yes, Betsy?

596
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,560
- Do you believe in the Lord?

597
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:54,200
- Of course I do.

598
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,240
Don't you?

599
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,960
- I used to.

600
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,720
- Oh, Betsy.

601
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:05,840
- I'm so afraid.

602
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,160
- Don't be.

603
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:08,600
I'm here with ya.

604
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,360
Good night, Betsy.

605
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,720
- Good night.

606
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,800
<i>(whisper): Betsy...
(echoing)</i>

607
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,240

<i>(whisper): Betsy...</i>

Let me out!!!!

618
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,160

<i>- Betsy, Betsy, Betsy, Betsy!

(Theny whimpering)

623
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,600
- How long has she been this way?

624
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,960
- Uh, maybe 30 minutes,

625
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,200
hmm?
- No, more than that.

626
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,960
- Theny?
(Theny whimpering)

627
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,560
Can you tell us what happened?

628
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,480
- It's all right, Theny.

629
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,360
- She was having a nightmare.

630
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,840
She was...

631
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,600
fighting with someone.

632
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,120
She started...

633
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,040
hitting herself.

634
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:16,480
I woke her up and then...

635
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:20,120
...then this...

636
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,480
voice...

637
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,920
(screaming)

638
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,080
- Betsy! Betsy, you're all right.

639
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,120
Shhh...

640
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,440
Shhh...

641
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:43,880
Betsy! Betsy! Come on!

642
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,520
Come here, come here!
Shhh! Shhh!

643
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:48,040
Shhh! Here, look at me.

644
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,720
Look at me, look at me!

645
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,480
Shhh, shhh.

646
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,280

647
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,800

00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,800

Betsy! No! No!

667
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,280
Betsy!!!!!!!

<i>(Professor): It spoke.</i>

670
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:58,520
<i>It had a voice.</i>

671
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:01,640
<i>But what did it want?</i>

672
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,880
<i>Why was it making Betsy suffer so?</i>

673
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,760
<i>What did she do
to make it so angry?</i>

674
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,280
<i>The black wolf?</i>

675
00:56:10,360 --> 00:56:11,960
<i>The young girl,</i>

676
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,200
<i>visible only to Betsy;</i>

677
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,320
<i>the spirit
which none of us could see.</i>

678
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,840
<i>How did they relate to each other?
Were they one and the same?</i>

679
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,160
<i>The attacks on Betsy got worse.</i>

680
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:24,680
<i>It spoke more and more.</i>

681
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,080
<i>I tried to get it to tell us</i>

682
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,960
<i>why it had come.</i>

683
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:31,800
<i>My questions
were answered with silence.</i>

684
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,840
<i>Why wouldn't it answer?</i>

685
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:56,320
- In my life...

686
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,160
I've done far more good than not.

687
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,680
Even saints...

688
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,440
commit sins of some sort.

689
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,200
How can you allow...

690
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,400
my family...

691
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:15,360
to be punished like this?!

692
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,840
It's the way of Satan!

693
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,560
I've offered you my life...

694
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,040
in recompense.

695
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,920
Why do you not take it?

696
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:34,560
I beg you.

697
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:37,040
I beg you, Lord.

698
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:38,520
Rid us of this curse.

699
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,640
Take my life.

700
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,360
The Lord has forsaken me, Richard.

701
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,800
(coughing)

702
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,200
- That which attacks Betsy...

703
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,480
attacks you as well.

704
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:18,680
"Someone who was once happy."

705
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,080
To whom do you think that refers?

706
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:25,880
- Kate Batts.

707
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:29,840
Everything points to her.

708
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,240
- Well, look, if she is the cause,
than why not just return the profit

709
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:35,320
and the timber to her?
- I tried.

710
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,840
Two months ago.

711
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:40,280
I sent Chloe to see her.

712
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,160
Money in hand.

713
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,320
She sent it back.

714
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,160
- Then she does mean
to torment you.

715
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,280
- Until I die.

716
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,240
- This...

717
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,320
entity...

718
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,680
...do you believe
it can read your mind?

719
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,200
- No, I do not.

720
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:08,760
No.

721
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:10,800
But I do believe it can...

722
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,400
hear our conversations.

723
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,480
That's how it knows
our every move.

727
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,520
(horses whinnying)
- You know,

728
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,600
the fog is awfully thick.
- We made good time.

729
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:35,520
We should be out of the woods soon.

Whoa!

It's gone.

743
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,360

745

- I'm right here, darling.

747
01:03:24,480 --> 01:03:26,680
- I had the most terrible nightmare.

748
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:27,960
- Shhh.

749
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,280
- You were sending me away.

750
01:03:30,360 --> 01:03:32,360
- Oh, I would never send you away.

751
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:34,600
- Mother?

752
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,280
- Yes, darling?

753
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:37,720

754
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:40,520
- No.

755
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,040
You're not gonna die.

756
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,360
Now, you just rest.

757
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,120
Just rest.

758
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,800
- If this entity...

759
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,960
...can hear us at all times...

760
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,840
...and is in all places...

761
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:07,640
- Then...

762
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,720
there's no escaping it.

763
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,560
- You care for her,
don't you, Richard?

764
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:20,560
More than the normal concern
of a teacher for a student.

765
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,000
- Why would you say that?

766
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,320
- I've seen you look at her.

767
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:38,960
- It is true,

768
01:04:39,040 --> 01:04:41,680
there is no one for a day's ride

769
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,480
as comely as your daughter, Lucy.

770
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,840
I would not presume to...

771
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:49,120
- Maybe you should.

772
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:00,920
- I'm almost 20 years her senior.

773
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,680
- The same is true of John and me.

774
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,240
- Can she love me?

775
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,680
- She will.

776
01:05:20,200 --> 01:05:23,080
I'm so afraid for her.
Richard, please, marry her.

777
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:26,400
- Your faith in me
is flattering, Lucy.

778
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,200
- Please.

779
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:31,640
- But I could not,

780
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,400
with good conscience,

781
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:37,600
marry Betsy
merely to be her protector.

782
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,640
I'm sorry.

783
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:45,880
I'm sorry.
