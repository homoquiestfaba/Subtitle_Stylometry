1
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,311
Man:
ON JUNE 8th, 1712,

2
00:02:17,354 --> 00:02:21,315
THE SANTA CRUZ,
FLAGSHIP OF SPAIN'S
LUCRATIVE GALLEON TRADE,

3
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:24,056
LEFT BARCELONA HEADED
FOR THE NEW WORLD.

4
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,277
- [ grunting ]
- [ shouting in Spanish ]

5
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,027
SLEEK AND FAST,

6
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,551
SHE CROSSED THE ATLANTIC
IN RECORD TIME.

7
00:02:42,553 --> 00:02:45,121
BUT AS THE SANTA CRUZ
NEARED THE NEW WORLD,

8
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,515
SHE ENCOUNTERED
A STORM AT SEA,

9
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,170
THE LIKES OF WHICH THE CREW
HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

10
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,304
TERRIBLE WIND AND WAVES POUNDED
THE VESSEL,

11
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:56,524
MAKING IT IMPOSSIBLE
TO NAVIGATE.

12
00:03:03,357 --> 00:03:05,185
[ yelling in Spanish ]

13
00:03:06,925 --> 00:03:10,799
FOR DAYS THE CREW SAILED ON,
OBLIVIOUS TO THEIR COURSE.

14
00:03:19,938 --> 00:03:23,115
THE DOOMED SHIP FOUNDERED
ON AN UNCHARTED REEF

15
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:25,640
AND QUICKLY DISAPPEARED
BENEATH THE WAVES...

16
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,775
TAKING THE ENTIRE CREW
WITH HER.

17
00:03:38,566 --> 00:03:40,394
IT IS RUMORED THAT
THE SANTA CRUZ

18
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:43,092
CARRIED PRICELESS DIAMONDS
AND JEWELS--

19
00:03:43,135 --> 00:03:45,268
THE CROWN JEWELS
OF THE SPANISH MONARCHY.

20
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,628
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU GUYS
WE'RE GONNA FIND ANY
DIAMONDS DOWN THERE,

21
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:59,282
BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU
A BEAUTIFUL DIVE

22
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:01,284
IF YOU PAY ATTENTION
TO A FEW SIMPLE RULES.

23
00:04:01,328 --> 00:04:05,288
IT'S IMPORTANT WE STAY TOGETHER
AT ALL TIMES AND LOOK OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

24
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:07,116
WHEN WE DIVE
AND EXPLORE THE OCEAN,

25
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:10,337
IT'S POTENTIAL
WILDERNESS ADVENTURE,
BUT IT'S ALSO DANGEROUS.

26
00:04:13,427 --> 00:04:15,342
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
THAT WE COMMUNICATE.

27
00:04:15,385 --> 00:04:17,082
ARE YOU
THREATENING US, FLYBOY?

28
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:20,085
IT'S YOUR DIME, PAL.
MISTAKES DOWN THERE
CAN GET YOU KILLED.

29
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,957
I'M JUST WARNING YOU.

30
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,915
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS,
YOU'RE BORING US SILLY.

31
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,701
- Woman: TYLER, PLEASE.
- WHAT?

32
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,355
WE GOT YOU, MR. WAGNER.

33
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:43,935
OKAY, IGOR,
WE'RE COMING CLOSE.
BRING US DOWN.

34
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,720
- FIVE MINUTES.
- OKAY.

35
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,548
IGOR?
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

36
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:49,680
WHAT, DID DR. FRANKENSTEIN
TAKE THE DAY OFF?

37
00:04:49,724 --> 00:04:52,379
- [ laughing ]
- HE'S RELIABLE
AND HE'S REASONABLE.

38
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:55,730
LET'S HIT THE DRINK,
BABE.

39
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:57,558
I COULD USE ONE
ABOUT NOW.

40
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,740
THIS IS TYLER'S IDEA
OF CELEBRATING OUR
ANNIVERSARY.

41
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:07,263
Tyler:
COME ON, RILEY.

42
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,918
YOU KNOW A LITTLE ADVENTURE
ALWAYS SPICES UP THE MARRIAGE.

43
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:12,529
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE DID
ON OUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY?
- WHAT?

44
00:05:12,573 --> 00:05:16,054
WE GOT CERTIFIED
TO BE DIVERS.

45
00:05:16,098 --> 00:05:18,056
I GAVE RILEY A CHOICE
THIS WEEKEND.

46
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,449
IT WAS EITHER SCUBA DIVING,

47
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:23,105
OR A MARATHON
OF MUD WRESTLING
AND HOT, STEAMY SEX.

48
00:05:23,148 --> 00:05:24,802
WHICH EXPLAINS
WHY I AM HERE.

49
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:32,984
THREE MINUTES.

50
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,465
YOU BETTER LOSE THAT TRINKET
BEFORE WE GO DIVING.

51
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:38,642
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MUCH THIS COST?

52
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:41,079
JUST DO IT, OKAY?
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU
TO BE TOO APPETIZING

53
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,516
TO THE MARINE LIFE
DOWN THERE.

54
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,388
AYE AYE, MR. COUSTEAU.

55
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:47,869
OKAY, WE JUMP OUT
HERE AT CAPE DEL ORO,

56
00:05:47,912 --> 00:05:49,392
WE DIVE DOWN
ABOUT 100 FEET,

57
00:05:49,436 --> 00:05:51,873
WE SWIM WEST ABOUT 150 METERS
TOWARD THE VESSEL,

58
00:05:51,916 --> 00:05:53,396
AND THEN THE VESSEL'S
RIGHT ABOUT HERE.

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,963
THE WATER'S GONNA BE
REALLY MURKY,

60
00:05:55,006 --> 00:05:57,052
SO IT'S IMPORTANT WE STAY
REALLY CLOSE TOGETHER.

61
00:05:57,095 --> 00:05:59,968
COMMUNICATION
IS VERY IMPORTANT.

62
00:06:00,011 --> 00:06:03,188
YOU'RE AN EX-NAVY MAN,
MR. WAGNER?

63
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:06,496
YEAH, SEALS.
JUST TRYING TO MAKE
ENDS MEET NOW.

64
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:08,716
IT SUCKS TO BE YOU,
DOESN'T IT?

65
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,154
- TYLER, PLEASE.
- WHAT?

66
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:15,070
HEY, DAD, ARE THEY PAYING YOU
ENOUGH MONEY TO PUT UP
WITH THIS JERK?

67
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:17,638
- NOT HARDLY.
- I DIDN'T THINK SO.

68
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:19,030
YOUR MOM COST ME MORE
WHEN WE SPLIT UP

69
00:06:19,074 --> 00:06:20,771
THAN SHE DID
WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.

70
00:06:20,815 --> 00:06:24,427
- YEAH, I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
- DON'T BE. IT'S NOT
YOUR FAULT.

71
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:26,690
WE'RE JUST HERE TO HAVE
A GOOD TIME. STICK WITH ME.

72
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:28,344
OKAY.
I TELL YOU WHAT,

73
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,651
HOW ABOUT NEXT TIME
WHEN WE GET TOGETHER
FOR THE WEEKEND,

74
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,393
- WE JUST GO TO DINNER
AND CATCH A BALLGAME?
- DEAL.

75
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:39,529
- [ beeping ]
- Igor: THIS IS IT.

76
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:45,056
Wagner:
OKAY, IGOR,
CIRCLE AROUND THE AREA.

77
00:06:58,026 --> 00:07:00,550
- RILEY, YOU'RE NEXT.
- READY.

78
00:07:03,161 --> 00:07:05,163
OKAY, MELISSA,
JOIN UP WITH RILEY.

79
00:07:05,207 --> 00:07:06,426
YOU GOT IT.

80
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:16,174
OKAY, BILLY,
JOIN UP WITH THE REST
OF THE GROUP.

81
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,707
YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED
OF YOUR OLD MAN, ARE YOU?

82
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:29,492
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YOU'RE MY HERO, DAD.

83
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:30,972
YOU ALWAYS WILL BE.

84
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:33,453
- I LOVE YOU, SON.
- I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD.

85
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:35,063
LET'S GO SWIMMING.

86
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:56,911
Everyone good?
Everything okay?

87
00:07:56,954 --> 00:07:59,217
- Jimbo, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Dad.

88
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,524
- Yeah, we're good.
- Melissa: We're good to go.

89
00:08:01,568 --> 00:08:03,091
Okay, now follow me
everyone,

90
00:08:03,134 --> 00:08:04,484
and remember,
stay together.

91
00:08:45,568 --> 00:08:47,352
Wagner:
Everyone stop!

92
00:08:49,006 --> 00:08:51,574
- What is it, Mr. Wagner?
- Kelp forest.

93
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,881
They provide food
and shelter to the sharks.

94
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:56,057
Stay together.
Jimbo, you okay?

95
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,102
Okay.

96
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:02,063
- You doing okay, Melissa?
- Yeah, I'm doing fine.

97
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,804
Come on, let's take
a look over there.

98
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:06,981
Come on, baby,
We've never done it
in a kelp bed.

99
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:09,113
They're not listening
to you, Dad.

100
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:11,768
- Melissa, check this out.
- Right behind you.

101
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:13,901
Wagner:
Billy, Melissa,
let's stay together.

102
00:09:13,944 --> 00:09:16,077
Give us a kiss.

103
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,125
Tyler, Riley,
let's skip the romance

104
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:22,605
and come back
with the group.

105
00:09:22,649 --> 00:09:24,520
I'll stick
with this group.
It's so pretty.

106
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,956
Hey, you guys,
let's stay together.

107
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,524
Riley, Melissa, Tyler.

108
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:33,268
They're not listening
to you either, Dad.

109
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,096
Damn weekend warriors.

110
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,018
Wagner:
Do me one big favor,
Jimbo,

111
00:09:44,061 --> 00:09:46,673
and I'll try
to get season tickets
to the games next year.

112
00:09:46,716 --> 00:09:48,979
What favor?

113
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:51,460
Don't tell your mother
what we did this weekend.

114
00:09:51,503 --> 00:09:53,157
Okay, you got it.

115
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,470
Tyler:
Hey. Hey, there it is.

116
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:04,038
Riley:
Wow, look at the size
of that thing.

117
00:10:04,081 --> 00:10:06,954
- Wow!
- Beautiful.

118
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,918
Let's see what we can find.

119
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,703
Riley:
Tyler, be careful now.

120
00:10:16,746 --> 00:10:19,096
It's bigger than I thought
it was gonna be.

121
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,359
Yeah, a lot bigger.

122
00:10:21,403 --> 00:10:24,188
- Hey, Tyler.
- Check this out.

123
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:26,103
Tyler, wait up.
Wait for me!

124
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,166
[ screaming, growling ]

125
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:04,680
[ screaming ]

126
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,647
[ screaming ]

127
00:12:43,675 --> 00:12:45,155
JESUS, SHARKS!

128
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,681
Jim:
SHIT, DAD!

129
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,947
SWIM, JIMBO!
SWIM!

130
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,296
Jim:
DAD, COME ON!

131
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:59,474
- RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
- KEEP SWIMMING, JIMBO!
MOVE!

132
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:05,959
[ screaming ]

133
00:13:54,311 --> 00:13:56,096
HELP!

134
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,013
COME ON.

135
00:14:01,405 --> 00:14:03,146
IGOR!

136
00:15:12,694 --> 00:15:14,739
I MISS YOU, DAD.

137
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,959
Boy:
HEY, DAD.

138
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:20,006
MOM JUST CALLED.
SHE SAID DINNER WAS READY.

139
00:15:20,049 --> 00:15:22,051
I'M HUNGRY
AND SHE CAN'T EAT WITHOUT US.

140
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:24,010
SO COULD WE GO HOME NOW?

141
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:27,535
YEAH, DANNY.
WE'LL GO HOME.

142
00:15:27,578 --> 00:15:30,146
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HERE ANYWAY?

143
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,369
THINKING.

144
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,066
ABOUT SHARKS?

145
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:40,243
- YOUR MOM TELL YOU THAT?
- YEAH.

146
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,464
- WELL, SHE'S RIGHT.
- SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT,
ISN'T SHE?

147
00:15:43,507 --> 00:15:45,857
I SUPPOSE
SHE TOLD YOU THAT, TOO.

148
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:47,903
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

149
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,519
- REMEMBER TO PUT
YOUR SEATBELT ON.
- OKIE-DOKE.

150
00:16:15,931 --> 00:16:18,673
MAYOR CORTELL CALLED TODAY.

151
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:22,807
HE SOUNDED VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THE BEACH FIESTA
NEXT WEEKEND.

152
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,027
HE CANCELED
THE BEACH FIESTA.

153
00:16:25,071 --> 00:16:27,725
- I'M JUST THE MESSENGER.
- Danny: WHY'D THEY CANCEL IT?

154
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:31,773
WELL, THE TOWN JUST
DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SPONSORS
TO FINANCE IT, HONEY.

155
00:16:31,816 --> 00:16:35,385
AMWAY, CORTELL WANTS
TO SEE YOU FIRST THING
IN THE MORNING.

156
00:16:35,429 --> 00:16:38,388
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING?
I WAS GOING TO TAKE DANNY--

157
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,699
PROBABLY JUST WANTS
TO MAKE SURE THE BEACHES
ARE SAFE FOR MEMORIAL DAY.

158
00:16:44,742 --> 00:16:46,483
AND WHAT'S THE VERDICT
ON THAT?

159
00:16:46,527 --> 00:16:49,095
THINK WE'LL BE ALL RIGHT,
BUT I'D LIKE TO SEND OUT
SOME PATROLS.

160
00:16:49,138 --> 00:16:53,795
- OF COURSE HE'S GONNA TELL ME
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY.
- WHAT ABOUT THE SHARKS?

161
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:55,014
[ sighs ]

162
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,016
EAT YOUR VEGETABLES,
DANNY.

163
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:58,843
WE LIVE ON THE BEACH,
JIMMY,

164
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:01,977
AND YOU HAVE MANAGED
TO SCARE HIM TO DEATH
ABOUT THE OCEAN.

165
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,587
HE'S AFRAID
TO GO SWIMMING.

166
00:17:03,631 --> 00:17:05,633
AND HE WON'T EVEN

CAN'T BLAME ME
FOR THE VEGETABLES.

THIS IS SO BEAUTIFUL,
HONEY, ISN'T IT?

171
00:17:43,366 --> 00:17:46,239
- NOT AS BEAUTIFUL
AS YOU ARE, DARLING.

172
00:17:46,282 --> 00:17:49,068
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I FINALLY GET YOU

173
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,863
OH, NO.

174
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:04,213
I THINK WE SPOKE
TOO SOON.

175
00:18:05,823 --> 00:18:07,695
I HATE TO TELL YOU, SEÑORITA,

176
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:09,958

DO YOU WANT ME
TO COME OVER THERE
AND PLAY?

189
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,930
I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE A RAIN CHECK.

190
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:21,437
Woman:
DON'T YOU LOOK NICE TODAY?

191
00:20:21,481 --> 00:20:23,265
I'M TAKING DANNY
TO THE BALLGAME.

192
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:25,049
THAT'S WHY
I'M WEARING THIS.

193
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:26,877
- MORNING.
- HEY.

194
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,836
I'D LIKE YOU
TO MEET MR. VOLKOFF.

195
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:30,707

00:20:30,751 --> 00:20:32,796
R.S.S. AND ASSOCIATES,
IS GOING TO UNDERWRITE

197
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,972
THE ENTIRE FESTIVAL
THIS YEAR.

198
00:20:35,016 --> 00:20:37,061
- SINCE WHEN?
- SINCE RECENTLY.

199
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,063
THE 11TH HOUR,
IF YOU WILL.

200
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:41,065
WOW. THAT'S GREAT.

201
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:44,025
JIM HERE IS IN CHARGE
OF HORSENECK BEACH SECURITY.

202
00:20:44,068 --> 00:20:47,071
THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND.
HOW ARE THINGS LOOKING
OUT THERE?

203
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:48,508
PRETTY GOOD.

204
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:52,033
I ALSO UNDERSTAND
YOU ARE ANDREW WAGNER'S SON?

205
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,819
YEAH.
YOU'VE DONE YOUR HOMEWORK.

206
00:20:55,863 --> 00:20:57,865
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

207
00:20:57,908 --> 00:21:02,261
MR. VOLKOFF IS INTERESTED
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE OUT
AT THE SANTA CRUZ.

208
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,001
GOT TO SPEND MONEY
TO MAKE MONEY.

209
00:21:04,045 --> 00:21:05,655
IT'S PART OF OUR
BUSINESS ARRANGEMENT.

210
00:21:05,699 --> 00:21:07,788
MR. VOLKOFF HAS BEEN MORE
THAN GENEROUS

211
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,965
AND I THINK THE LEAST WE CAN DO
IS POINT HIM IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE DIAMONDS.

212
00:21:11,008 --> 00:21:13,097
NO. I CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH THAT.

213
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,795
AND WHY IS THAT?

214
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:17,276
PERSONAL REASONS.

215
00:21:21,323 --> 00:21:24,500
I'LL LET YOU TWO DISCUSS
THE DETAILS.

216
00:21:26,502 --> 00:21:29,723
I TRUST YOU'LL DO
THE RIGHT THING.

217
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:40,429
I WON'T TAKE HIM
TO THAT SHIP, JOHN.

218
00:21:40,473 --> 00:21:42,431
- JIMMY, YOU KNOW--
- IT'S A LEGEND.

219
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:43,867
THERE IS
NOTHING OUT THERE.

220
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:46,435
SO LET VOLKOFF FIGURE
THAT OUT FOR HIMSELF.

221
00:21:46,479 --> 00:21:48,655
HE'S PAYING THE BILLS.
I PAY YOURS.

222
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:50,439
YOU DO THE MATH.

223
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,833
SO THIS IS WHY
YOU CALLED ME OUT HERE
THIS MORNING?

224
00:21:52,876 --> 00:21:57,316
NO, I ALSO CALLED YOU IN
TO TALK ABOUT NEXT WEEK'S
SECURITY AT THE BEACH.

225
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:02,495
WE NEED TO TAKE
SPECIAL MEASURES
THIS YEAR.

226
00:22:02,538 --> 00:22:04,845
I'D LIKE TO THINK
THAT I DO THAT EVERY YEAR.

227
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,803
YES, BUT THIS
IS A SPECIAL YEAR.

228
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,893
GOD KNOWS WE NEED IT AFTER
LAST YEAR'S FINANCIAL DISASTER.

229
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:12,505
OH, COME ON.
I SAW GREAT WHITES
LAST YEAR.

230
00:22:12,548 --> 00:22:13,767
WE AVERTED DISASTER.

231
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,727
AND ANOTHER THING,
JUST PROMISE ME

232
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:20,121
YOU WON'T WRITE
ANY MORE ARTICLES
IN THE NEWSPAPER

233
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,906
ABOUT SHARK INFESTED WATERS
OFF HORSENECK BEACH.

234
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,995
WELL, I'M HOPING
THAT I WON'T HAVE TO,

235
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,868
BUT I GOTTA TELL YOU THE "SWIM
AND FEED THE REEF SHARK PROGRAM"

236
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:29,391
CERTAINLY ISN'T
HELPING MATTERS.

237
00:22:29,435 --> 00:22:31,132
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- WHAT I MEAN IS,

238
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:35,441
EVENTUALLY THOSE SHARKS
MAY START TO ASSOCIATE
FOOD WITH PEOPLE.

239
00:22:35,484 --> 00:22:38,400
- THAT CAN ATTRACT
THE GREAT WHITES.
- GREAT WHITES?!

240
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:40,402
SIR, THEY ARE OUT THERE.
I'VE SEEN THEM.

241
00:22:40,446 --> 00:22:42,361
AND I'VE SEEN
WHAT THEY CAN DO.

242
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,972
IF THERE'S SO GODDAMN MANY
GREAT WHITES OUT THERE,

243
00:22:45,015 --> 00:22:46,887
HOW COME YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT SEES THEM?

244
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,846
BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
WHO'S LOOKING FOR THEM!

245
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:53,328
- MAYOR CORTELL,
I NEED PATROLS.
- WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

246
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,025
DON'T GO DOWN
THAT ROAD AGAIN, OKAY?

247
00:22:55,069 --> 00:22:57,941
LOOK, THIS SUMMER HOLDS
THAT SPECIAL PROMISE.

248
00:22:57,985 --> 00:22:59,421
I JUST WANT YOU TO DO
YOUR BEST.

249
00:22:59,465 --> 00:23:02,293
- THAT'S ALL I ASK.
- YEAH.

250
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:07,037
IT'S A DEAL, SIR.

251
00:23:07,081 --> 00:23:09,475

00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:12,434
JUST THIS WEEKEND'S

253
00:23:12,478 --> 00:23:14,001
THE ANNIVERSARY
OF MY DAD'S DEATH.

254
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:16,046
CAN'T GET HIM OUT
OF MY HEAD.

255
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:18,571
I KNOW IT'S GOT TO BE TOUGH
DEALING WITH THE WAY
YOUR DAD DIED.

256
00:23:18,614 --> 00:23:22,009
BUT I'M ASK YOU,
AND I'M PAYING YOU,

257
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:24,838
TO GET HIM OUT
OF YOUR HEAD FOR THE SUMMER.

258
00:23:24,881 --> 00:23:25,926
COULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME?

259
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:28,407

PROMISE YOU, JOHN.

00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,454
YEAH, SON,
THAT'S GRANDPA.

263
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,281
WAS GRANDPA COOL?

264
00:24:18,892 --> 00:24:21,634
- WAY COOL.
- WHEN DID GRANDPA DIE?

265
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,374
BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,
DANNY,

266
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,551
WHEN HE SAVED MY LIFE.

267
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,988
SEE, GRANDPA,
HE WASN'T JUST COOL,

268
00:24:28,031 --> 00:24:30,991
HE WAS ALSO
THE BRAVEST GUY I EVER KNEW.

269
00:24:31,034 --> 00:24:33,820
IF IT WASN'T FOR HIM,
I WOULDN'T BE HERE RIGHT NOW.

270
00:24:33,863 --> 00:24:36,039
I WOULDN'T HAVE MET MOM

271
00:24:36,083 --> 00:24:38,477
AND YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE
RIGHT NOW EITHER.

272
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,479
I DON'T GET IT.

273
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:45,048
THAT'S A STORY
FOR ANOTHER TIME, SON.

274
00:24:46,223 --> 00:24:48,443
WAS GRANDPA ATE UP
BY SHARKS?

275
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,271
- YOUR MOTHER TELL YOU THAT?
- YEP.

276
00:24:50,314 --> 00:24:52,969
AND SHE'S ALWAYS RIGHT,
RIGHT?

277
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:55,102

I HATE SHARKS.
THEY SUCK.

THING TO WASTE.

287
00:26:07,783 --> 00:26:09,480

I'M NOT PAYING YOU
TO LOOK AT THE LADIES,

WE DON'T WANT THEM
TOO WELL BEHAVED.

- We don't?
- NO.

302
00:26:51,044 --> 00:26:52,654
THAT WOULD SIGNAL BEER SALES
ARE DOWN.

303

Good news all around,

THAT'S INSANITY.
I CAN'T DO THAT.

337
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:56,376
I KNOW SOME PEOPLE LOST
THEIR LIVES OUT THERE.

338
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,595
I'M NOT COMPLETELY
INSENSITIVE TO THAT, OKAY?

339
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:01,381
BUT I GOTTA DEAL WITH PEOPLE
THAT MAKE THEIR LIVELIHOOD
IN THIS TOWN.

340
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:03,818
I'M NOT GONNA LET
A BUNCH OF PEOPLE LOSE
THEIR BUSINESSES

341
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,341
OVER SOME RANDOM ACT
OF NATURE.

342
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:07,909
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
A STRAY DOG HERE!

343
00:31:07,953 --> 00:31:09,780
YOU LET PEOPLE OUT
IN THAT WATER,

344
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,957
YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE
RINGING THE DINNER BELL.

345
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,917
- PEOPLE WILL USE CAUTION.
- YOU USE CAUTION WHEN YOU'RE
DRIVING ON WET ROADS!

346
00:31:15,961 --> 00:31:18,746
- WITH THESE THINGS
IT'S KILL OR BE KILLED.
- SO KILL THEM!

347
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:21,880
IF YOU MESS WITH THIS FIESTA,
IT'S GONNA BE MORE VICIOUS
THAN A SHARK ATTACK.

348
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:24,752
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT.
IF YOU HAVE EDUCATE THEM,
EDUCATE THEM!

349
00:31:24,795 --> 00:31:28,974
- BUT THE BEACH STAYS OPEN!
- LET ME EXPLAIN SOMETHING
TO YOU.

350
00:31:29,017 --> 00:31:32,586
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
THAN AN EVOLUTIONARY BLIP

351
00:31:32,629 --> 00:31:34,501
THAT SEPARATES
THE GREAT WHITE

352
00:31:34,544 --> 00:31:36,895
FROM THE JURASSIC SHARKS
OF 50 MILLION YEARS AGO.

353
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:40,811
WE'RE PRACTICALLY TALKING
ABOUT MODERN-DAY DINOSAURS
OUT THERE.

354
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:43,292
AND JUST LIKE THEY DID
FOR 50 MILLION YEARS,

355
00:31:43,336 --> 00:31:45,686
SHARKS ARE GONNA GIVE BIRTH
IN SPRING AND SUMMER

356
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:48,167
IN WARM TEMPERATURE WATERS
JUST LIKE OURS.

357
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,995
I'LL TELL YOU
ANOTHER THING--

358
00:31:50,038 --> 00:31:53,781
NOBODY KNOWS
WHAT THE GESTATION PERIOD
IS FOR A GREAT WHITE.

359
00:31:53,824 --> 00:31:57,176
WAGNER, THANKS A LOT FOR
THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC LESSON.

360
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:58,960
WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU
TRYING TO TELL ME?

361
00:31:59,004 --> 00:32:01,789
THESE SHARKS ARE BIGGER
AND FASTER

362
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:03,922
AND MORE AGGRESSIVE
THAN ANY I'VE EVER SEEN

363
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,663
AND WE COULD BE TALKING
ABOUT AN ENTIRE SCHOOL
OF THEM.

364
00:32:06,707 --> 00:32:09,362
A GIANT SCHOOL OF MAN-EATING
JURASSIC SHARKS?

365
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,973
YOU'VE BEEN READING
TOO MANY COMICS.

366
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:13,932
TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE
WHO DIED TODAY.

367
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,987
GLAD TO SEE YOU GUYS
ARE KEEPING YOURSELVES BUSY.

368
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,947
YOU WANT A TURN?
THE RECORD'S FIVE MINUTES.

369
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,818
FIVE MINUTES,
THREE SECONDS.

370
00:32:30,861 --> 00:32:33,777
NOT ANYMORE MORE.
I'M GONNA BEAT IT.

371
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:37,042
YOU GUYS HEARD WHAT HAPPENED
AT THE BEACH, RIGHT?

372
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:39,000
YEAH, WE KNOW.

373
00:32:39,044 --> 00:32:40,262
BUSINESS
IS DOWN 50%.

374
00:32:40,306 --> 00:32:41,960
WE MIGHT HAVE
TO FIND ANOTHER JOB.

375
00:32:42,003 --> 00:32:44,614
WELL,
IT'S GONNA GET WORSE.

376
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:47,356
BEACH IS ON HIGH ALERT
UNTIL THOSE SHARKS ARE KILLED.

377
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,967
SO I'M GONNA NEED
A LITTLE HELP.

378
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:51,273
- YOU BOYS UP FOR IT?
- WE THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER ASK.

379
00:32:51,317 --> 00:32:55,016
- YEAH, WELL, SO DID I.
- LET'S DO IT. I'M IN.

380
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,800
HOW ABOUT YOU, GORDO?

381
00:32:58,063 --> 00:33:00,804
THINK YOU'LL BE OVER
THIS HANGOVER BY TOMORROW?

382
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,807
HEY, YOU KNOW ME, JIMMY.
I'M THERE.

383
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:05,548
ALL RIGHT.

384
00:33:05,592 --> 00:33:07,376
SEE YOU AT THE MARINA
AT 7:00.

385
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:09,465
DON'T FORGET TO BRING
YOUR GEAR.

386
00:33:10,597 --> 00:33:12,903
IT'S NOT GOING
TO BE A PLEASURE CRUISE.

387
00:33:19,127 --> 00:33:21,434
GOOD AFTERNOON
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

388
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,566
I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES

389
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:26,134
to those of you
who lost loved ones
on the beach yesterday.

390
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:28,832
SON OF A BITCH.

391
00:33:28,876 --> 00:33:31,052
I've assembled a crack team
of divers...

392
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,749
YEAH, RIGHT.

393
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:35,274
...to go out to the beach
and kill the sharks,

394
00:33:35,317 --> 00:33:37,145
and make our great beach
safe once again.

395
00:33:37,189 --> 00:33:39,756
I'd like to second
the mayor's sentiments.

396
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,454
SO THAT'S
MR. VOLKOFF, HUH?.

397
00:33:41,497 --> 00:33:43,760
YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

398
00:33:43,804 --> 00:33:46,502
And I fully support him.

399
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:50,463
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- YEAH, I'VE BEEN BETTER.

400
00:33:50,506 --> 00:33:53,161
- WORRYING ABOUT TOMORROW?
- A LITTLE BIT.

401
00:33:53,205 --> 00:33:55,076
IT'S NOT JUST THAT,
IS IT?

402
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,904
CARRIE.

403
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:59,167
HE DIED A LONG TIME AGO,
JIMMY.

404
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,517
- IT WASN'T--
- WHAT?

405
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:03,302
IT WASN'T MY FAULT?

406
00:34:03,345 --> 00:34:05,434
YOU DON'T THINK I'VE HEARD THAT
A MILLION TIMES?

407
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:06,870
IT DOESN'T
CHANGE ANYTHING.

408
00:34:06,914 --> 00:34:09,830
WHEN I WAS IN THAT WATER
AND I SAW THOSE SHARKS...

409
00:34:18,708 --> 00:34:21,059
Move!

410
00:34:21,102 --> 00:34:22,886
Swim, Jimbo, swim!

411
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:25,976
THE ONLY THINK I COULD THINK
ABOUT WAS SAVING MYSELF.

412
00:34:36,204 --> 00:34:38,815
THE ONLY THINK MY DAD
COULD THINK ABOUT WAS SAVING ME.

413
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,991
YOU'RE NOT ASHAMED
OF YOUR OLD MAN, ARE YOU?

414
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:43,124
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU'RE MY HERO, DAD.
ALWAYS WILL BE.

415
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,909
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING,
CARRIE.

416
00:34:45,953 --> 00:34:48,129
I JUST LEFT HIM THERE.

417
00:34:48,173 --> 00:34:50,958
- I LEFT HIM THERE,
AND MY FATHER DIED.
- I KNOW.

418
00:34:51,001 --> 00:34:53,656
AND I'M SORRY.

419
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:57,007
BUT YOUR FATHER
LOVED YOU, JIMMY.

420
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:00,272
AND YOU WOULD'VE DONE
THE EXACT SAME THING FOR DANNY.

421
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:04,798
THANKS.

422
00:35:04,841 --> 00:35:06,756
I WOULD.

423
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:11,848
YOU'RE THE BEST THING
THAT'S EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

424
00:35:13,807 --> 00:35:16,244
I DIDN'T MEAN TO TAKE
ALL THAT OUT ON YOU.

425
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:19,204
- IT'S JUST THIS WHOLE THING--
- I KNOW, BABE.

426
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,293
COME HERE.

427
00:35:21,336 --> 00:35:23,208
COME HERE.

428
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:26,820
NOW WHY DON'T WE
GO TO BED?

429
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:28,865
- I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.
- YEAH?

430
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:30,824
I PROMISE.

431
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:33,043
I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL
A LOT BETTER.

432
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,396
I'M GONNA LOOSEN
YOU UP.

433
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:39,659
BET YOU ARE.

434
00:35:47,841 --> 00:35:49,799
BUT I LIKE TO BE
ON TOP.

435
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:51,192
OH, YEAH?

436
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,849
YOU'VE BEEN VERY BAD.

437
00:36:29,796 --> 00:36:32,929
GUYS I WANT TO TAG
AT LEAST THREE OR FOUR
OF THESE SHARKS, OKAY?

438
00:36:32,973 --> 00:36:34,583
JIMMY, WHY DON'T
WE JUST KILL THEM?

439
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:36,759
I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE THEY CAME FROM, GORDO,

440
00:36:36,803 --> 00:36:38,283
JUST IN CASE THERE'S MORE.

441
00:36:38,326 --> 00:36:40,981
WHATEVER YOU SAY, CHIEF.

442
00:36:54,821 --> 00:36:57,215
HERE YOU ARE.

443
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,042
OH.

444
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:05,875
TOURIST BUSINESS
WAS OFF 40% LAST YEAR

445
00:37:05,919 --> 00:37:08,008
BECAUSE WAGNER
MADE SUCH A BIG STINK
ABOUT A BUNCH

446
00:37:08,051 --> 00:37:10,837
OF GREAT WHITE SHARKS
HE THOUGHT WE SAW OUT THERE.

447
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,534
HIS FATHER
WAS A NAVY MAN, NO?

448
00:37:14,623 --> 00:37:17,583
SO WAGNER MUST KNOW
THE SEA QUITE WELL.

449
00:37:17,626 --> 00:37:19,759
MUST BE
A KNOWLEDGEABLE MAN.

450
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,587
NOT ABOUT ECONOMICS,
HE'S NOT.

451
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,371
THE WHOLE PLACE
WAS EMPTY LAST SEASON.

452
00:37:23,415 --> 00:37:25,591
EVERYBODY WENT TO FUCKING
DISNEYLAND INSTEAD.

453
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:27,636
WHEN IS HE GOING
TO TAKE US TO THE BOAT?

454
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,812
I DON'T KNOW.

455
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:32,511
HE'S FIGHTING ME ON THAT.
I CAN'T SAY FOR SURE.

456
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:37,603
MAYOR CORTELL,

457
00:37:37,646 --> 00:37:39,561
THIS WAS PART
OF THE ARRANGEMENT.

458
00:37:39,605 --> 00:37:41,911
I WILL PULL THE FUNDING
FOR THE FIESTA

459
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:44,827
IF I AM NOT OUT THERE
DIAMOND HUNTING BY THE END
OF THE WEEK.

460
00:37:44,871 --> 00:37:46,220
BUT MR. VOLKOFF--

461
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,309
WHICH WILL LEAVE
YOUR SUNNY LITTLE COMMUNITY

462
00:37:48,353 --> 00:37:51,094
WITH NO MONEY
AND A TERRIBLE SHARK PROBLEM.

463
00:37:51,138 --> 00:37:52,182
THE CHOICE IS YOURS.

464
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,190
MAKE THE RIGHT ONE.

465
00:38:09,591 --> 00:38:12,028
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
I WANT YOU TO BE CAREFUL
ABOVE ALL ELSE.

466
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:13,639
OKAY?

467
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:15,510
ARE YOU SURE THAT
THESE ARE GREAT WHITES?

468
00:38:15,554 --> 00:38:18,121
I'M POSITIVE, GORDO.
YOU SAW THE DAMAGE.

469
00:38:18,165 --> 00:38:20,776
IT'S THE WAY THEY ATTACK--
FROM BELOW, WITHOUT WARNING.

470
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,735
THERE'S THREE KINDS
OF SHARK ATTACK.

471
00:38:22,778 --> 00:38:25,215
THE BUMP AND BITE,
THE HIT AND RUN AND
THE SNEAK ATTACK.

472
00:38:25,259 --> 00:38:27,043
[ laughing ]
WHAT DO YOU GET

473
00:38:27,087 --> 00:38:29,045
WHEN YOU CROSS
THREE DIVERS IN A CAGE

474
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,309
AND A PISSED OFF
GREAT WHITE?

475
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,875
- HUH?
- WHAT DO YOU GET?

476
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:36,749
- A BOXED LUNCH.
- Man: OH, MAN.

477
00:38:36,792 --> 00:38:38,968
Jim:
WHERE'D YOU FIND
THIS GUY, CAESAR?

478
00:38:39,012 --> 00:38:40,970
COME ON. IT'S JUST
A LITTLE SHARK HUMOR.

479
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,930
ALL RIGHT, STAY FOCUSED.
ESPECIALLY YOU, GORDO.

480
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:19,052
Jim:
YOU KNOW, FELLAS,

481
00:39:19,095 --> 00:39:21,141
MOST PEOPLE WHO'VE EVER
GONE SWIMMING IN THE OCEAN

482
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:24,492
HAVE BEEN WITHIN 15 FEET
OF A SHARK WITHOUT EVER
KNOWING IT.

483
00:39:24,536 --> 00:39:26,668
OH GREAT.
HOW REASSURING.

484
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:31,020
REMEMBER,
ONLY THE UNDERBELLIES
OF THE GREAT WHITE

485
00:39:31,064 --> 00:39:32,805
ARE WHITE IN COLOR.

486
00:39:32,848 --> 00:39:35,938
THEIR TOPS ARE GRAY
SO THEY CAN BLEND IN
WITH THE DARK WATER,

487
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:38,201
ALLOWING THEM TO ATTACK
THEIR PREY UNNOTICED.

488
00:39:38,245 --> 00:39:40,682
REMEMBER THAT.
ANY QUESTIONS?

489
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:42,423
- I'VE GOT ONE.
- WHAT'S THAT?

490
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:43,772
CAN WE GO HOME?

491
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:48,037
DON'T WORRY ABOUT US, BOSS.
WE'RE SOLID.

492
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:50,431
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

493
00:39:50,475 --> 00:39:52,390
KEEP THAT CHUM LINE GOING.

494
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:54,522
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S GONNA DRAM THEM IN?

495
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,045
A SHARK CAN SMELL
A DROP OF BLOOD

496
00:39:56,089 --> 00:39:57,438
IN 2,000 GALLONS
OF WATER.

497
00:39:57,482 --> 00:40:00,702
- THAT SHOULD DO IT.
- THAT SHOULD DO IT.

498
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:04,532
REMEMBER,
ANY SHARKS YOU CAN'T KILL,
TRY AND TAG.

499
00:40:04,576 --> 00:40:07,100
BUT, ABOVE ALL,
BE CAREFUL.

500
00:40:07,143 --> 00:40:09,581
COMMUNICATE WITH ME
AT ALL TIMES, ALL RIGHT,

HOW'S YOUR AIM,
JORDAN?

00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:53,285
I'M BETTER AT BETTING
ON GAMES THAN PLAYING THEM.

680
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:55,156
PRETEND WE'RE PLAYING
FOR MONEY.

681
01:00:13,871 --> 01:00:16,743
- NICE.
- THAT'S ONE.

682
01:00:24,664 --> 01:00:26,753
HEY, HOW MANY SHARKS
ARE WE DEALING WITH?

683
01:00:26,797 --> 01:00:29,843

I'LL JOIN YOU IN ONE

692
01:01:43,787 --> 01:01:45,876
THAT IS WHY YOU'RE
CELEBRATING, ISN'T IT?

693
01:01:45,919 --> 01:01:48,095
IT'S HARD TO SAY, SIR.

694
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:51,708
THE GESTATION PERIOD
OF THE GREAT WHITE

695

IS THAT A YES OR A NO?

696
01:01:53,884 --> 01:01:56,234
IT'S A MAYBE.

I'm very happy to announce
the beach is now open and safe,

01:02:03,763 --> 01:02:06,723
Thanks mostly to Jim Wagner
of Beach Security.

And Larry Foster
and Jordan McNeil.

701
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:10,683
Couldn't have done it
without them.

702
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:13,642
Due to the courage
and determination
of these fine men,

703
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:16,384
the beach is now open
and the fiesta will

704
01:02:16,428 --> 01:02:18,909
So enjoy the festivities.

705

I KNOW YOU, WAGNER.

706

YOU STILL THINK
THERE'S SHARKS OUT THERE,
DON'T YOU?

707
01:02:25,567 --> 01:02:27,526
I'D HAVE LIKED

IF YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S SAFE,

712
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:37,710
THEN YOU NEED
TO TELL THE MAYOR.

713
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,059
COME ON, HONEY,
YOU HEARD THE GUY.

714
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:41,148

THAT DEPENDS ON WHAT
YOU'RE SELLING.

We'd like to set up
a meeting with you.

726
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:08,915

WHAT KIND OF MEETING?

727
01:03:08,959 --> 01:03:12,701
We want to know
if you're interested
in investing with us.

THANKS TO YOU, THIS WENT OFF
WITHOUT A HITCH.

YEAH.

741
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,876
IT WAS THE RUSSIAN GUY,
WASN'T IT?

742
01:03:58,530 --> 01:04:00,662
WHAT DOES HE WANT?

743
01:04:00,706 --> 01:04:03,491
HE WANTS ME TO TAKE HIM
OUT TO THE SANTA CRUZ.

744
01:04:03,535 --> 01:04:06,494
HE'S CONVINCED
THAT THOSE DIAMONDS
ARE STILL THERE.

745
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:09,715
YOU ARE NOT GOING BACK
OUT THERE AGAIN, ARE YOU?

746
01:04:09,758 --> 01:04:11,760
OF COURSE NOT.
I CAN'T.

747

01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:15,808
BECAUSE YOU HAVE ENOUGH
TO WORRY ABOUT RIGHT NOW.

752
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:43,880
I APOLOGIZE
IF SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES
ARE A BIT AGGRESSIVE.

753
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:48,885
I ASSURE YOU I CAME HERE
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

754
01:04:50,712 --> 01:04:53,890
OKAY, AT LEAST LET ME BUY
THE LOCAL HERO A DRINK.

YOU'RE GONNA FIND ANY
DIAMONDS OUT THERE.

763
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:21,265

CONSIDER IT AN INVESTMENT

FOR YOUR FAMILY.

OUT THERE.

I CAN'T GO BACK
TO THAT PLACE.

769
01:05:37,150 --> 01:05:40,110
MY BROTHER SURVIVED
OUT THERE,

770
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:42,155
BUT DIED
THREE MONTHS AGO.

771
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:44,070
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOUR BROTHER?

772
01:05:44,114 --> 01:05:47,291
IN FACT, I BELIEVE
YOU TWO ONCE MET.

- IGOR THE PILOT?
- YES.

HE TOLD ME
ABOUT SANTA CRUZ

777
01:05:58,737 --> 01:06:00,521

- PAYBACK?
- OR CONSIDER IT
A BUSINESS DEAL.

788
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,817

IS MOST GENEROUS.

789

BUT YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME UP WITH A PLAN B.

792
01:06:41,736 --> 01:06:42,911
THAT IS A SHAME TO HEAR,

793

BECAUSE PLAN B'S
ARE OFTEN MISGUIDED,
