1
00:00:35,537 --> 00:00:38,604
I'm telling you, Tommy,
I never felt better in my life.

2
00:00:38,628 --> 00:00:41,694
Everyone should have
a heart attack. Even you.

3
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:44,634
Especially you.

4
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:50,920
No, I'm not in my office.
I'm in Johnny's truck.

5
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,357
Because they won't let me drive yet.

6
00:00:53,381 --> 00:00:57,274
I can't even take a piss
without asking the Pope.

7
00:00:57,298 --> 00:01:00,756
Look, Tommy,
what I want you to... Tommy?

8
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,826
Tommy? Hello?

9
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:05,718
- What the hell's...
- Hey, hey, hey!

10
00:01:05,742 --> 00:01:07,482
Hey.

11
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:10,418
The lighter doesn't work.

12
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:14,509
You mean you got a telephone in
the truck and no cigarette lighter?

13
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:20,036
- What kind of values did I give you kids?
- Mom said I shouldn't let you smoke.

14
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,778
Your mother married me.
What the hell does she know?

15
00:01:22,802 --> 00:01:26,477
Hey, come on! Put that thing
away.

16
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:32,741
You just had a major heart attack,
for Christ's sake.

17
00:01:35,772 --> 00:01:37,861
He's here.

18
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:41,623
What the hell is eating you?
You and Amy still going at it?

19
00:01:41,647 --> 00:01:43,799
- Amy and me are fine.
- Good.

20
00:01:43,823 --> 00:01:46,280
Cos you mess up with her
and you're crazy.

21
00:01:46,304 --> 00:01:50,937
That woman is the best thing that
ever happened to you. Amen.

22
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:55,419
Hey, I er... got a buyer coming
to look at the business tomorrow.

23
00:01:55,443 --> 00:01:56,575
Who?

24
00:01:56,618 --> 00:01:58,596
You remember Norm Gillis?

25
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,165
- Norm Gillis?- Yeah. He
runs a fishing fleet on the Cape.

26
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:05,952
I know who Norm Gillis is.
What about him?

27
00:02:05,976 --> 00:02:09,869
- He's looking for new partners.-
Are you out of your mind?

28
00:02:09,893 --> 00:02:12,436
- I knew you'd like it.
- Oh, boy.

29
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,439
It sounds like one of your
brother's harebrained schemes.

30
00:02:15,463 --> 00:02:22,063
Did you ever wake up one day and say,
"To hell with it"?

31
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,839
Not go to work.

32
00:02:23,863 --> 00:02:26,320
Not deal with the union.

33
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:28,844
Take a trip. A risk.

34
00:02:29,869 --> 00:02:31,566
Yeah.

35
00:02:33,568 --> 00:02:35,721
You don't know what I'm talking
about.

36
00:02:35,745 --> 00:02:37,635
I know what you're talking
about.

37
00:02:37,659 --> 00:02:38,878
Yeah?

38
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:43,424
- You had the urge to do that?
- Of course I did!

39
00:02:43,448 --> 00:02:49,568
- What did you do?
- Oh, you'd be surprised, Johnny.

40
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:51,238
What?

41
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:54,157
I'll tell you sometime.

42
00:02:54,546 --> 00:02:56,722
Tell me now.

43
00:02:56,766 --> 00:03:00,366
You come by the house tonight.

44
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,860
I will.

45
00:03:03,903 --> 00:03:06,926
If you need anything, anything
at all...

46
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,213
ask Frank.

47
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:12,453
Go chop down a tree!

48
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:15,436
See you tonight.

49
00:03:31,496 --> 00:03:33,866
- Faye.
- Good morning, Mr Scanlan.

50
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,370
- Hey, boss.
- Hi, Mr Scanlan.

51
00:03:37,937 --> 00:03:41,264
- Morning, BJ.
- Good morning, Mr Scanlan.

52
00:03:41,288 --> 00:03:44,920
The union social committee sent the plant.

53
00:03:44,944 --> 00:03:49,166
These are are your calls, your
mail.

54
00:03:51,385 --> 00:03:53,260
One more thing.

55
00:03:53,866 --> 00:03:55,546
Welcome back.

56
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:03,310
Surprise!

57
00:04:16,497 --> 00:04:17,977
Dad?

58
00:04:20,371 --> 00:04:24,211
Poems are made by fools like me.

59
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:28,553
But only God can make a tree.

60
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,708
If I have to listen to that poem one
more time, I'm gonna puke.

61
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:37,364
I told you, Mrs Wysocki,
we're helping this tree.

62
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:40,410
- Johnny, you got a call.
- Thanks.

63
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:43,109
- Chuck. Down.
- Let me take that.

64
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:47,311
Yeah. Up and down my whole
life.

65
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:51,465
I got more mileage than an astronaut
and I'm where I was 20 years ago.

66
00:04:51,489 --> 00:04:53,139
I hear you.

67
00:04:55,406 --> 00:05:00,953
- The murder weapon.
- Mrs Wysocki, look at that tree.

68
00:05:00,977 --> 00:05:04,260
It's smiling. Hey, do me a
favour.

69
00:05:04,284 --> 00:05:10,404
Keep and eye on the murder
weapon for me. Thank you.

70
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:14,816
- Hello.
- Johnny.

71
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,012
- Frank?
- Dad's dead.

72
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:19,362
I don't know how it happened.

73
00:05:19,386 --> 00:05:22,409
He was alive one minute
and then he wasn't.

74
00:05:22,433 --> 00:05:28,154
Nothing like this has ever happened
to me before. I think I killed him, Jack.

75
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:31,679
Are you there? Did you hear what I said?

76
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:34,682
- I killed Dad.
- Calm down.

77
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:36,882
Frank, calm down!

78
00:05:36,926 --> 00:05:43,169
- I killed him.
- Stop saying that. You didn't kill him.

79
00:05:43,193 --> 00:05:46,955
- How did it happen?- I set
up a surprise party for him.

80
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,957
You know, to welcome him back.

81
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,568
We were all in his office,
waiting for him.

82
00:05:51,592 --> 00:05:53,875
He opened the door like he
always does.

83
00:05:53,899 --> 00:05:57,009
We yelled "Surprise"
and he dropped dead.

84
00:05:57,033 --> 00:06:01,622
- You gotta be kidding me.-
You're blaming me too, aren't you?

85
00:06:01,646 --> 00:06:04,562
No, I didn't mean...

86
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:07,541
Of course I'm not blaming you.

87
00:06:07,565 --> 00:06:09,543
I don't know what to do.

88
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:12,546
Everybody's waiting for me to
say something. I don't know what to say.

89
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:14,330
Frank, listen to me!

90
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:15,984
- Just listen.
- What?

91
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,988
- Did you call Mom?
- No, I called you.

92
00:06:20,012 --> 00:06:24,601
OK, now, what you gotta do
is call her doctor.

93
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,474
- Dr Doyle?
- No, not Dr Doyle.

94
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:30,651
- Why not?
- He's a dentist, that's why.

95
00:06:30,675 --> 00:06:33,132
- Oh, right.
- Dr Goodman.

96
00:06:33,156 --> 00:06:38,676
- Dr Goodman.
- Now, you call the funeral home.

97
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,227
- I killed him, Johnny.
- What?

98
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:45,318
- He came back to work and I killed him.
- He was an old man.

99
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:47,755
He's just got over a massive
heart attack.

100
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:51,498
- Right, he did. I didn't kill him, did I?
- No. No.

101
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:54,544
Of course you didn't kill him.
No.

102
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:57,318
I'll see you at Mom's.

103
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:00,183
He killed him.

104
00:07:13,848 --> 00:07:15,435
It's about time.

105
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:18,655
Thank you, Aunt Maureen.
Is my mother upstairs?

106
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:21,571
- She is.
- Where shall we put all the food?

107
00:07:21,595 --> 00:07:23,312
In the kitchen, I guess.

108
00:07:23,336 --> 00:07:26,968
- What about these fruit
baskets?- What church is the service in?

109
00:07:26,992 --> 00:07:31,103
- I don't know. Why ask me?
- You're the oldest man in the family.

110
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:34,976
- Next to die.
- Thank you, Aunt Maureen.

111
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,241
I wouldn't have thought of
that if you hadn't reminded me.

112
00:07:39,265 --> 00:07:42,853
- My condolences, Johnny.
- They're all yours.

113
00:07:42,877 --> 00:07:46,446
- Father...
- Please...

114
00:08:07,815 --> 00:08:12,405
- God took him, Johnny.
- He's in a better place now.

115
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:15,843
- I want your father laid out here.
- In the house here?

116
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:19,716
I told Francis. I want a fine
Irish wake.

117
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,154
Nothing shabby about it. He
deserves that.

118
00:08:22,178 --> 00:08:26,245
We'll give Dad a wake he'll
never forget.

119
00:08:26,269 --> 00:08:29,552
- You're getting lines in your face like him.
- I know.

120
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:33,904
- You should put something on them.
- I know.

121
00:08:33,928 --> 00:08:38,779
- You're my oldest now,
Johnny.- I've always been your oldest, Mom.

122
00:08:38,803 --> 00:08:43,000
I need you now.
You won't leave me, will you?

123
00:08:43,024 --> 00:08:46,864
No. Of course I won't leave you.

124
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:53,206
Where else am I gonna go?

125
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:57,153
Come on. Get some sleep.

126
00:08:59,476 --> 00:09:02,194
- Who's taking care of
the body?- The Syracusas.

127
00:09:02,218 --> 00:09:04,413
You should have called the
Fitzregans.

128
00:09:04,437 --> 00:09:08,896
- They did a beautiful job on Tom Walsh.
- He looked better dead than alive.

129
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,422
Mr Scanlan, my heart goes out to you
during this trying time.

130
00:09:13,446 --> 00:09:16,208
Deirdre Floss. Greenside Realty.

131
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:20,299
- Your sister-in-law called...
- The body's still warm.

132
00:09:20,323 --> 00:09:21,648
- John Scanlan?
- Yeah.

133
00:09:21,672 --> 00:09:24,129
Here's Francis now. Let's ask
him.

134
00:09:24,153 --> 00:09:27,873
Answer some of these questions.

135
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:32,789
- Thank God you're here, Francis.
- Is my brother here?

136
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:36,619
- Nervous as a fish on Friday.
- Excuse me.

137
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,689
- Johnny.
- Yeah.

138
00:09:38,732 --> 00:09:42,692
- Frank, I'll take them.
- Thanks.

139
00:09:44,085 --> 00:09:46,586
- How's Mom doing?
- She's asleep.

140
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,719
Can you believe Aunt Maureen?
She loves a funeral.

141
00:09:49,743 --> 00:09:55,029
- Where did you get the band?
- At the office. They're for when people die.

142
00:09:55,053 --> 00:09:56,726
In here, guys.

143
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,599
- Did Mom tell you the wake's here?
- Who's paying for this?

144
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:02,471
- This is gonna be big, Johnny.- Yeah.

145
00:10:02,495 --> 00:10:05,561
Did you call Terry and Nora?

146
00:10:05,585 --> 00:10:08,521
Nora's in a convent.
They can't use the phone.

147
00:10:08,545 --> 00:10:10,420
Send her a fax.

148
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:14,222
- They've got a fax?
- I sent her one after Dad's operation.

149
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:17,617
- In the kitchen.
- I'll call Terry from Dad's office.

150
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:22,561
Where do you want these cases,
Mr Scanlan?

151
00:10:24,691 --> 00:10:30,717
You'd pay three times what I
charge anywhere else in the city.

152
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:35,243
- I give everything to your alimony.
- I haven't gotten a cheque in six months.

153
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,289
I don't make that kind of money.

154
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:41,684
The hell you don't. You have two shows
on Broadway and six national tours.

155
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:45,297
No-one wants me in New York.
They don't want dance.

156
00:10:45,321 --> 00:10:51,390
They want chandeliers and
helicopters. I don't speak to Broadway.

157
00:10:51,414 --> 00:10:56,264
You don't speak to Broadway,
fine. Speak to my lawyer.

158
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:57,550
Hello.

159
00:10:59,204 --> 00:11:00,988
Johnny. Hi.

160
00:11:01,032 --> 00:11:03,282
What's the matter?

161
00:11:10,433 --> 00:11:12,870
God.

162
00:11:12,913 --> 00:11:15,307
When?

163
00:11:16,439 --> 00:11:18,789
How?

164
00:11:20,443 --> 00:11:22,923
You're kidding.

165
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:27,252
How's Mom?

166
00:11:27,276 --> 00:11:31,517
- She's fine.- Oh,
man. I can't handle this.

167
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:34,389
You gotta come, Terry. He was
your father.

168
00:11:34,413 --> 00:11:36,913
- Dad hated me.
- Who said that?

169
00:11:36,937 --> 00:11:41,048
- Your psychiatrist?
- No, Dad, a couple of Christmases ago.

170
00:11:41,072 --> 00:11:45,661
Oh. And you didn't say
the same thing to him?

171
00:11:45,685 --> 00:11:48,906
Terry. Mom needs you.

172
00:11:48,949 --> 00:11:51,319
I'll be there. You know I will.

173
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:53,389
That's my girl.

174
00:11:53,432 --> 00:11:56,150
- As soon as possible.
- OK.

175
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:59,074
I love you, Johnny. Bye.

176
00:12:04,878 --> 00:12:08,238
My father died this morning.

177
00:12:11,015 --> 00:12:13,863
I fear death terribly. Don't
you?

178
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:17,727
Not as much as I fear my family.

179
00:12:19,763 --> 00:12:21,939
Boyd.

180
00:12:21,982 --> 00:12:25,484
- I'll make you a deal.
- What kind of a deal?

181
00:12:25,508 --> 00:12:30,428
You can use my studio
any time you want...

182
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:33,864
rent-free.

183
00:12:33,907 --> 00:12:38,410
- What do I have to do?
- Come to my father's funeral with me.

184
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,697
Is that all?

185
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,613
As... my husband.

186
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:45,092
Oh.

187
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:49,072
You still haven't told them
we're divorced.

188
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:52,641
- I love it.- I haven't gotten round to it,
OK?

189
00:12:52,665 --> 00:12:57,017
- It was four years ago.
- So what?

190
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:59,692
I'm not gonna tell them now.

191
00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:02,716
What would I do up there?

192
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:07,332
Francis.

193
00:13:07,376 --> 00:13:09,421
Johnny.

194
00:13:09,465 --> 00:13:13,009
My sincerest condolences
in this difficult time.

195
00:13:13,033 --> 00:13:15,490
Your father was a wonderful man.

196
00:13:15,514 --> 00:13:20,016
He helped me when I was negotiating
a contract with the gravediggers.

197
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,433
Louise.

198
00:13:21,477 --> 00:13:25,718
My sincerest condolences
in this difficult time.

199
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:28,721
I understand
the wake will be in your home.

200
00:13:28,745 --> 00:13:33,203
For a man like your father,
a wake at home is only fitting.

201
00:13:33,227 --> 00:13:37,556
I presume we're anticipating
deluxe arrangements.

202
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,950
Only the best. No expense
spared.

203
00:13:40,974 --> 00:13:44,301
- Absolutely, Carmine.
- Frank, we're not made of money.

204
00:13:44,325 --> 00:13:46,869
No, we're made of dust.

205
00:13:46,893 --> 00:13:50,493
And unto dust we shall return.

206
00:13:51,855 --> 00:13:55,051
- Johnny's the family
tight-wad.- I'm not a tight-wad.

207
00:13:55,075 --> 00:14:00,230
Let's get the great man a great casket,
shall we?

208
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:03,973
Francis was always the risk-taker,
weren't you.

209
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:07,499
- Were you?- I remember that playoff game.

210
00:14:07,523 --> 00:14:11,024
Three hits, four RBIs.
Beautiful.

211
00:14:11,048 --> 00:14:12,895
Just beautiful.

212
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,488
The finest casket available.

213
00:14:16,532 --> 00:14:21,774
32-ounce Persian bronze with
a Neapolitan ecru crepe interior.

214
00:14:21,798 --> 00:14:24,298
Hermetically sealed.

215
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:27,325
Oh. Mrs Piskuris.

216
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,328
95 years old.

217
00:14:31,068 --> 00:14:35,388
- Who wants to be 95?
- 94-year-olds.

218
00:14:44,429 --> 00:14:48,583
Next door we have a
45-year-old. Bill Sullivan.

219
00:14:48,607 --> 00:14:52,892
- Wasn't he in your class?
- No, he wasn't.

220
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:58,680
- Never too early to make plans, Johnny.
- I'm in great shape.

221
00:14:58,704 --> 00:15:00,837
I need some air.

222
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,512
Get something made out
of mahogany or walnut.

223
00:15:04,536 --> 00:15:07,733
This looks like something
you store nuclear waste in.

224
00:15:07,757 --> 00:15:09,507
See you later.

225
00:15:16,026 --> 00:15:17,723
Oh!

226
00:15:36,873 --> 00:15:38,396
Young?

227
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:41,418
Sorry, Johnny, I didn't mean to scare you.

228
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:43,943
- It's Peter Syracusa.
- Oh.

229
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:47,250
Hi, John. How you doing? I'm
sorry to hear about your dad.

230
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:50,602
I'm finishing here. I do the
embalming for my cousin.

231
00:15:50,626 --> 00:15:53,082
Bill Sullivan. Wasn't he in your class?

232
00:15:53,106 --> 00:15:55,171
- No, he wasn't.
- Sorry.

233
00:15:55,195 --> 00:16:00,220
- We decided on the double-sided coffin.
- Johnny, come here.

234
00:16:00,244 --> 00:16:04,311
I was telling Carmine how in our family the
oldest son digs the father’s grave.

235
00:16:04,335 --> 00:16:08,750
- My father dug his father's grave.
- And your son will dig yours.

236
00:16:08,774 --> 00:16:11,536
Dig the grave the way you
usually do it.

237
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,930
- You're not gonna do it?!
- It's a beautiful tradition.

238
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,977
We're not talking
about planting an azalea bush.

239
00:16:18,001 --> 00:16:22,242
It'd take me a month to dig a hole
that size. You do it. OK? Thank you.

240
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:25,506
Come on, let's get out of here.

241
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,944
Kids,
your grandfather died this morning.

242
00:16:28,968 --> 00:16:30,579
Back off.

243
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:33,732
Is that the depth of
your emotion? Back off?

244
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,212
That's how they express
themselves nowadays.

245
00:16:36,236 --> 00:16:38,867
If I die, is that what you'll
say? "Back off"?

246
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:44,090
- The phrase is "when I die", Dad.
- Thank you for clearing that up.

247
00:16:44,114 --> 00:16:47,484
Why does everyone
always have to yell at me?

248
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:51,793
- What did I say?
- Nice move there, Dad.

249
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:56,450
Maybe Dad's death is the event that says,
"Things are gonna change."

250
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,714
- "This part's over."
- What's gonna change?

251
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:04,284
I got a brochure from that
marina I was telling you about.

252
00:17:04,308 --> 00:17:06,136
Oh. Yeah.

253
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:08,462
A guy from the chamber
of commerce called me.

254
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,465
Fishing's a business
with a hell of a future.

255
00:17:11,489 --> 00:17:14,163
Think what you like. It's a
fact.

256
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:16,383
The diet of this country is
changing.

257
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:20,082
Yeah, well, with all this
cholesterol,

258
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,868
fish is the cattle of the
future.

259
00:17:22,892 --> 00:17:25,479
- Are you serious about this?
- Yeah.

260
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:28,221
I was talking to Dad about it
this morning.

261
00:17:28,245 --> 00:17:31,877
- And what did he say?
- He said it was a good idea.

262
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:34,923
Oh. When would we do this?

263
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:37,036
Now.

264
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,691
Next month. Soon.

265
00:17:39,735 --> 00:17:42,670
You can't change everything
in the middle of your life.

266
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:46,152
When else do you change it?
Nobody changes in the beginning.

267
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:49,656
And at the end it's too late.

268
00:17:52,486 --> 00:17:55,361
What time did they say?

269
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:59,644
- What are you doing?- I'm
marking the things I want.

270
00:17:59,668 --> 00:18:02,081
Your father wanted me to have
this.

271
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:05,388
- When did he say that,
Denise?- My condolences, Frank.

272
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,521
Councilman Chaney.

273
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:10,263
Thanks for coming. It means a
lot to me.

274
00:18:10,287 --> 00:18:13,222
- I hope I can count on your support.
- Of course.

275
00:18:13,246 --> 00:18:17,444
- Stop Denise, she's plundering again.
- Would you hold the chair?

276
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,620
This is a wake, not a garage
sale.

277
00:18:19,644 --> 00:18:21,883
Why don't you go and see my
mother?

278
00:18:21,907 --> 00:18:25,104
- Your mother hates me.
- She doesn't hate you.

279
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:29,325
She tells everyone I got
pregnant so Frank would have to marry me.

280
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:32,154
I've listened to that for 20
years.

281
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:34,461
I've earned this stuff.

282
00:18:34,485 --> 00:18:37,812
I never noticed that before.

283
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:40,685
The body's almost ready for
viewing.

284
00:18:40,709 --> 00:18:42,928
All right. OK.

285
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:46,821
The potato salad is much
better than the Riley funeral.

286
00:18:46,845 --> 00:18:50,433
- That's a relief.
- But not as good as the Grotowskis'.

287
00:18:50,457 --> 00:18:52,784
Watch what you're doing. Down.

288
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:56,888
Easy. Easy. Jesus. Move over
there.

289
00:18:59,858 --> 00:19:02,489
We should have got the deluxe
casket.

290
00:19:02,513 --> 00:19:04,210
Shut up.

291
00:19:04,254 --> 00:19:08,234
I think you're gonna love the
job Peter did with your father.

292
00:19:08,258 --> 00:19:11,978
He's gonna open the casket now.

293
00:19:16,396 --> 00:19:18,224
Beautiful.

294
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:24,709
Beautiful. If I must say so
myself.

295
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:27,254
Very nice.

296
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:38,307
We'll leave you alone now
to view the body in private.

297
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:39,855
Thanks.

298
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:43,467
All right, let's go.

299
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:50,319
Do we have to whisper in here?

300
00:19:50,343 --> 00:19:52,084
I don't know.

301
00:19:52,128 --> 00:19:54,304
Who is this?

302
00:19:55,044 --> 00:19:57,500
This doesn't even look like Dad.

303
00:19:57,524 --> 00:20:04,116
- He does look a little soft.-
Soft? He looks like Liberace.

304
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,901
I could sure use his advice
right now.

305
00:20:06,925 --> 00:20:09,991
Unsworth's making a play
for control of the union.

306
00:20:10,015 --> 00:20:12,733
- Who's Unsworth?
- He's a lawyer.

307
00:20:12,757 --> 00:20:15,214
For the banks
we got our pension money in.

308
00:20:15,238 --> 00:20:16,737
Went to Harvard.

309
00:20:16,761 --> 00:20:20,436
Thinks he'll push Frank Scanlan aside?
He's crazy.

310
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,875
The son of a bitch has got
himself a fight. You know?

311
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:26,336
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

312
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:30,079
- Go get Mom. For the...
- Oh.

313
00:20:46,878 --> 00:20:49,503
Who are you, old man?

314
00:20:53,842 --> 00:20:59,242
What the hell got you
through all these years?

315
00:21:06,115 --> 00:21:07,856
There you go.

316
00:21:08,465 --> 00:21:10,206
That's you.

317
00:21:12,643 --> 00:21:16,843
What were you gonna tell me
tonight?

318
00:21:22,392 --> 00:21:25,762
Father Hallahan. They
could have sent a monsignor.

319
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,939
He looks like an altar boy.

320
00:21:27,963 --> 00:21:33,843
If we might bow our heads
and say a silent prayer.

321
00:21:52,074 --> 00:21:54,380
Spec that action.

322
00:22:02,998 --> 00:22:04,956
Amen.

323
00:22:10,527 --> 00:22:12,921
- Amen.
- Amen.

324
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:15,247
Let us partake of the bounty

325
00:22:15,271 --> 00:22:21,253
the neighbours have provided
for this solemn occasion.

326
00:22:21,277 --> 00:22:23,540
Who is she?

327
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,478
- Do you want to come with me?
- Thank you.

328
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:33,342
I never thought she'd come here.

329
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:02,405
I'm John Scanlan.

330
00:23:03,449 --> 00:23:04,973
Johnny.

331
00:23:06,583 --> 00:23:09,368
John... or Johnny.

332
00:23:11,066 --> 00:23:13,653
So you were a friend of my
father's?

333
00:23:13,677 --> 00:23:15,809
Cassie Slocombe.

334
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:21,269
- Are you here alone?
- Yeah.

335
00:23:21,293 --> 00:23:23,271
Do you live around here?

336
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:27,014
I run a business on Independence Hill.

337
00:23:27,038 --> 00:23:30,061
- What kind of business?
- A salon.

338
00:23:30,085 --> 00:23:32,696
A beauty salon.

339
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:36,579
- You cut my father's hair?
- No.

340
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,810
- You cut my mother's hair?
- I never met your mother.

341
00:23:40,834 --> 00:23:42,725
- So what...
- Johnny.

342
00:23:42,749 --> 00:23:45,511
Did I tell you how bad my hip
is?

343
00:23:45,535 --> 00:23:47,208
- Ten minutes ago.
- It's worse.

344
00:23:47,232 --> 00:23:50,037
Well, it's a look, Mrs Wysocki.

345
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:55,216
- Don't be such a snob.
- What should I say to these people?

346
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,002
- Just make small talk.
- Small talk.

347
00:23:58,026 --> 00:24:00,506
- Terry.
- Frank.

348
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,095
- Boyd.- Death is the great equalizer.

349
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,227
A little smaller than that.

350
00:24:06,251 --> 00:24:08,751
Mom. Mom, are you OK?

351
00:24:08,775 --> 00:24:11,972
Oh, yes, dear. Yes. I'm fine.

352
00:24:11,996 --> 00:24:16,455
Oh, I haven't seen you two
in such a long time.

353
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:19,066
Boyd's on the road a lot, aren't you, dear?

354
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,918
I try to be.

355
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:24,941
Your eyes are getting a little
puffy. You should put tea bags on them.

356
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:27,814
My mom sleeps with tea bags on
her eyes.

357
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:29,033
Fascinating.

358
00:24:29,057 --> 00:24:31,165
Come in the parlor, dear.

359
00:24:31,189 --> 00:24:32,869
Think small.

360
00:24:37,369 --> 00:24:40,024
Hello.

361
00:24:40,068 --> 00:24:43,788
We never did get along, did we?

362
00:24:44,246 --> 00:24:46,335
Two hard-heads.

363
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:55,984
Who am I gonna argue with now?

364
00:24:56,693 --> 00:25:00,653
Who are you gonna argue with?
God?

365
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,855
I'm gonna miss you.

366
00:25:21,109 --> 00:25:23,609
I loved him so much.

367
00:25:24,677 --> 00:25:27,332
Yeah. It's OK.

368
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:32,400
I'm glad Boyd could come.

369
00:25:32,424 --> 00:25:34,837
- We're divorced.
- Divorced?!

370
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:39,190
Why don't you say it louder?
I don't think Dad heard you.

371
00:25:39,214 --> 00:25:41,583
When did this happen?

372
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:45,263
- Four years ago.
- Four years?

373
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:47,483
Does Mom know?

374
00:25:47,526 --> 00:25:50,984
- You're the only one I told.
- Why did you tell me?

375
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,160
I tell you everything, Johnny.

376
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:56,468
- Don't tell anybody else. Nobody.
- Oh, thanks.

377
00:25:56,492 --> 00:25:58,818
- Terry, honey.
- Hi, Aunt Sissy.

378
00:25:58,842 --> 00:26:03,649
So, when are you going to
give your mother a grandchild?

379
00:26:03,673 --> 00:26:06,173
When all else fails.

380
00:26:08,547 --> 00:26:10,723
Hiya, Terry.

381
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:13,746
- Peter.
- Sorry about your dad.

382
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:18,142
My family took care of the
arrangements. I did your father personally.

383
00:26:18,166 --> 00:26:19,665
He looks great.

384
00:26:19,689 --> 00:26:21,386
Yeah.

385
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:24,148
I started with a neutral
foundation base.

386
00:26:24,172 --> 00:26:26,889
Then I followed that
with mostly earth tones.

387
00:26:26,913 --> 00:26:29,414
That's Cherokee red on his
cheeks.

388
00:26:29,438 --> 00:26:31,179
Really?

389
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:35,333
Boy, I can't believe I'm here.

390
00:26:35,357 --> 00:26:38,553
It seems like every time I come home
the clocks have stopped.

391
00:26:38,577 --> 00:26:41,861
- So the dance career's flying?- Oh, yeah.

392
00:26:41,885 --> 00:26:44,211
Probably saw me in People
magazine.

393
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:48,041
The 200 million most interesting people
in the United States.

394
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:50,440
I just squeaked in.

395
00:26:52,722 --> 00:26:55,222
Is that the gentleman you ran
away with?

396
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:58,356
Yeah, the gentleman
I danced into the sunset with.

397
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,749
Caused a lot of conversation
round here.

398
00:27:00,773 --> 00:27:02,925
Oh, I'll bet it did.

399
00:27:02,949 --> 00:27:05,189
- So, you have a wife?
- A wife?!

400
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:09,584
Yeah. One of those women who
seemed such a good idea at the time.

401
00:27:09,608 --> 00:27:12,508
No, I don't have a wife.

402
00:27:12,611 --> 00:27:16,112
- Whatever happened to Paula?
- To Paula?

403
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:19,377
She married Anthony Tambini.

404
00:27:19,401 --> 00:27:23,121
- Am I smiling?
- Yeah, you are.

405
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:27,080
- So what have you been doing?
- Me?

406
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:29,256
I got out of the service.

407
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,302
Did a lot of drugs. Got busted.

408
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:33,956
Did some time. Got born again.

409
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:36,394
Got unborn again. Did rehab.

410
00:27:36,418 --> 00:27:38,831
Now I do the embalming.

411
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,730
And I work out.

412
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:44,950
Well, you've kept busy.

413
00:27:46,558 --> 00:27:49,058
You're still pretty.

414
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,911
Yeah, right!

415
00:27:54,044 --> 00:27:57,153
- How could you come here like this?
- How else was I to come?

416
00:27:57,177 --> 00:28:01,288
- Leave her. I'm glad you
came.- I'm glad someone is.

417
00:28:01,312 --> 00:28:04,160
- Is this guy gonna marry you?
- I don't want him to.

418
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:07,338
- Tell me I didn't hear that.
- She doesn't need this from you.

419
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:11,322
Big sister is much bigger sister!

420
00:28:11,975 --> 00:28:13,692
- Would you shut up?
- Why?

421
00:28:13,716 --> 00:28:15,694
I told you to get rid of that
earring.

422
00:28:15,718 --> 00:28:18,349
- Councilman. My son Tony.
- Hi.

423
00:28:18,373 --> 00:28:23,136
Was mugged by a gang of
transvestites. They pierced his ear.

424
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,964
- Go outside.
- What did I do?

425
00:28:24,988 --> 00:28:29,098
Walk around the block a few times,
then go home.

426
00:28:29,122 --> 00:28:31,144
- How's New York?
- OK.

427
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:32,667
Explain it to them.

428
00:28:32,691 --> 00:28:34,539
I have an image to maintain.

429
00:28:34,563 --> 00:28:37,324
Is that all you ever
think about? Your union?

430
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:41,981
Don't worry. I'll stay with Uncle
Johnny and Aunt Amy. They understand.

431
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:43,939
Yeah, sure. Right.

432
00:28:43,963 --> 00:28:45,854
- Understand what?
- I...

433
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:48,204
Of course you can stay any time you want.

434
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:51,033
I can't believe this.
Illegitimate pregnancy.

435
00:28:51,057 --> 00:28:53,471
You always think it only
happens to the other guy.

436
00:28:53,495 --> 00:28:57,518
I was gonna wait till I had the baby,
but I had to come see Grandpa!

437
00:28:57,542 --> 00:29:00,913
- Is she going into Labour?
- Hormones.

438
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:05,657
Same as me. I cried for
the last seven months.

439
00:29:05,681 --> 00:29:07,963
Here's your mother. Does she know?

440
00:29:07,987 --> 00:29:09,859
Does she?

441
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:13,404
- Does she?
- I don't know. Does she?

442
00:29:13,428 --> 00:29:15,212
No.

443
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,104
- Somebody better tell her.
- She better not find out like this.

444
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:20,976
- Get that coat.
- Here. Put this coat on.

445
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,239
Come on. Cover up.

446
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:28,157
- Hello, Grandmother. I'm so sorry.
- Sweetheart, thank you for coming.

447
00:29:28,181 --> 00:29:30,595
Come and see your grandfather.

448
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:35,556
Keep your coat on, honey.
She's coming down with a cold.

449
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:38,330
Keep warm, sweetheart.

450
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:42,544
My little girl.

451
00:29:42,587 --> 00:29:44,957
I remember the day she was born.

452
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:47,263
I gave up a baseball career for her.

453
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:54,127
You gave up because you
couldn't hit left-handed pitching.

454
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:09,104
So when is my first
great-grandchild due?

455
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:12,617
In three weeks.

456
00:30:15,141 --> 00:30:18,580
Oh, baby.

457
00:30:18,623 --> 00:30:21,365
Thank you for asking.

458
00:30:21,409 --> 00:30:23,691
Where's the father?

459
00:30:23,715 --> 00:30:27,850
Well, he's er... he's not
involved.

460
00:30:27,893 --> 00:30:31,853
Well, he was involved at one
time.

461
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:38,046
I want this child,
but just not with him.

462
00:30:38,251 --> 00:30:40,839
Your mom got pregnant
so she could marry the man.

463
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:44,451
Now you get a man
so you can get pregnant.

464
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:48,195
That's what they call progress.

465
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:52,962
Johnny, what is this?

466
00:30:53,005 --> 00:30:56,985
Denise is staking out
the pieces she wants.

467
00:30:57,009 --> 00:30:59,727
How can Frank put up with her?

468
00:30:59,751 --> 00:31:02,600
I love this son of a bitch!

469
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:04,776
- He needs a beer.
- Yeah.

470
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,692
- Take him upstairs.
- Right in the kitchen?

471
00:31:07,716 --> 00:31:10,466
Oh, Johnny, who's she?

472
00:31:12,024 --> 00:31:16,222
You know what pissed me off
most about Dad and his lady friends?

473
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:18,964
He used to use me as an alibi.

474
00:31:18,988 --> 00:31:21,164
- What?
- Yeah.

475
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:26,537
He'd say he was going to
a game or a movie with me.

476
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:30,018
He'd give me five bucks
and tell me not to tell Mom.

477
00:31:30,042 --> 00:31:32,064
I didn't know that.

478
00:31:32,088 --> 00:31:35,688
There's a lot you didn't know.

479
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:24,420
- Bye.
- - Save the next dance for me!

480
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:28,337
She reminds me of you. Way back when.

481
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:30,514
Don't even think about it.

482
00:32:30,538 --> 00:32:34,256
- Mom.
- Amy says you're staying at a hotel.

483
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,826
Well... Mom, the last thing you
need to think about are house guests.

484
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:42,482
You wouldn't mind sleeping
in Frank's old room, Boyd?

485
00:32:42,506 --> 00:32:44,615
I'll sleep anywhere.

486
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:47,250
We all know that.

487
00:32:47,293 --> 00:32:49,794
- You did his grave yet?
- What?

488
00:32:49,818 --> 00:32:52,797
- Your father said it was a tradition.
- He told you that?

489
00:32:52,821 --> 00:32:57,381
- You gonna do it?
- Dig his grave? No.

490
00:32:58,217 --> 00:33:00,718
Too bad. It's kinda romantic.

491
00:33:00,742 --> 00:33:04,199
It's not as if I'd be digging
in the bogs of Kilkenny.

492
00:33:04,223 --> 00:33:07,507
Still, there's something
kind of sexy about it.

493
00:33:07,531 --> 00:33:10,360
- Sexy?
- Oh.

494
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,992
You only have to dig
a symbolic amount.

495
00:33:14,016 --> 00:33:15,515
Not the whole thing.

496
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:18,562
This is my last obligation to
the family.

497
00:33:18,586 --> 00:33:21,477
Just so you know,
Dad was the ruler of this family.

498
00:33:21,501 --> 00:33:24,916
Sure. When it came to the normal stuff,
yeah.

499
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,268
But when it came to the dirt,
you was all so scared of him.

500
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:31,313
You wouldn't tell him that.

501
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:35,013
That's the stuff I got.
Hang on tight, everybody.

502
00:33:35,037 --> 00:33:38,756
- We have liftoff!- Boys,
come on. Let's get down.

503
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,802
- Get up!
- What are you doing? Let go!

504
00:33:41,826 --> 00:33:43,499
- Oh, my God!
- All aboard!

505
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,719
- Here we go!
- Get on, Sam.

506
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,993
Let's go bury Dad!

507
00:33:48,877 --> 00:33:52,639
Just like old times.
I'm carrying you two again.

508
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:55,599
You never carried me.- Oh, no?

509
00:33:55,623 --> 00:34:00,125
Who drove you to New York to
elope with that suicidal tap-dancer?

510
00:34:00,149 --> 00:34:02,736
- Ancient history.
- Yeah?

511
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,869
Who else did you tell that you
and Boyd...

512
00:34:04,893 --> 00:34:09,438
Hey, don't you dare
say anything about that.

513
00:34:09,462 --> 00:34:12,770
Boyd's gay. Right?

514
00:34:12,814 --> 00:34:14,642
I knew it.

515
00:34:14,685 --> 00:34:19,864
Frank, I almost forgot
how dumb you can be.

516
00:34:19,908 --> 00:34:24,366
Which reminds me. Who took your exam
so you could graduate?

517
00:34:24,390 --> 00:34:27,065
I had a learning disability.

518
00:34:27,089 --> 00:34:29,839
Yeah. You were stupid.

519
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,985
Nora was the only one
that left me alone.

520
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:36,465
Oh, God. Daddy's little Nora.

521
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:39,014
The perfect child.

522
00:34:39,057 --> 00:34:42,254
Excuse me while I go throw up.

523
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:46,867
- End of the line.
- Hey, wait a minute.

524
00:34:46,891 --> 00:34:49,565
Yeah, go on. You've seen Mom.

525
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:53,526
She can't drive any more.
Electric things scare her.

526
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:56,398
Do you know what music she
listens to?

527
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:59,164
- Reggae.
- Come on!

528
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:04,711
I walk in last night and she
was listening to Bob Marley.

529
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:09,542
When this hole is filled up
the day after tomorrow,

530
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:12,438
I am a free man.

531
00:35:17,661 --> 00:35:20,161
That's it. I'm done.

532
00:35:20,664 --> 00:35:25,079
- You're done?
- Yeah. Is something wrong?

533
00:35:25,103 --> 00:35:26,777
It's kind of crooked.

534
00:35:26,801 --> 00:35:30,302
- I think it's too deep.
- Are you two finished?

535
00:35:30,326 --> 00:35:32,415
Dad's dead.

536
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:42,227
- Let's go home.
- You go. Take Sam.

537
00:35:42,251 --> 00:35:45,317
- OK? I wanna stay for a
while.- See you at home.

538
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:46,559
Yeah.

539
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:59,287
What do they mean, too deep?

540
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:05,551
What are they gonna bury in here,
a canary? What a...

541
00:36:11,846 --> 00:36:15,110
Frank? Oh, shit!

542
00:36:33,606 --> 00:36:35,759
Come on, take my hand.

543
00:36:35,783 --> 00:36:38,196
- Come on, take it.
- Yeah.

544
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,178
OK, I'm...

545
00:36:41,049 --> 00:36:43,636
I'm gonna... I'm gonna jump.

546
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,246
You got it. Come on.

547
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:46,794
I got you.

548
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:51,339
Thanks. I slipped.

549
00:36:51,363 --> 00:36:53,496
I should hope so.

550
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:57,258
- What are you doing here?
- I wanted to see if you'd dig his grave.

551
00:36:57,282 --> 00:37:00,157
You saw. Are you happy?

552
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:05,049
Your father'd be happy, Johnny.

553
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,528
What do you do?

554
00:37:06,552 --> 00:37:09,705
Hang round cemeteries
and pull people out of graves?

555
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:12,104
Not as a habit, no.

556
00:37:13,168 --> 00:37:18,568
- Night.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

557
00:37:20,001 --> 00:37:22,307
Who are you?

558
00:37:22,351 --> 00:37:25,199
There's so much I didn't know
about my dad.

559
00:37:25,223 --> 00:37:28,724
You should find one of his
friends and ask them about him.

560
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,620
Like who?

561
00:37:30,663 --> 00:37:33,991
Aunt Amy and I were trying to figure
out who that strange woman was.

562
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:36,254
- Yes.
- What strange woman?

563
00:37:36,278 --> 00:37:38,517
At the wake. Didn't you see her.

564
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:40,911
- She was very pretty.
- Very.

565
00:37:40,935 --> 00:37:43,067
Very pretty?

566
00:37:43,111 --> 00:37:46,917
- Maybe she was your father's mistress.
- Or his love child.

567
00:37:46,941 --> 00:37:49,484
That would make her your sister.

568
00:37:49,508 --> 00:37:51,684
My sister?

569
00:37:52,685 --> 00:37:55,036
I'll get it.

570
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:58,406
If that's Tom, tell him I'm
asleep.

571
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,171
Hello?

572
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:06,215
Oh, hi. Listen,
let me take this in the other room.

573
00:38:06,612 --> 00:38:10,679
My father did have a mistress.
A few of them.

574
00:38:10,703 --> 00:38:12,828
Did Grandma know?

575
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,839
Everybody knew.

576
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:21,554
You know, I hate men.

577
00:38:22,367 --> 00:38:26,086
Except for you. Cos you'd
never have a mistress.

578
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:30,438
- Why do you say that?
- You're not the type. It's obvious.

579
00:38:30,462 --> 00:38:34,162
What... What type am I?

580
00:38:34,205 --> 00:38:36,120
Well, you know.

581
00:38:36,164 --> 00:38:37,706
No, I don't. I don't.

582
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,907
Tell me.

583
00:38:41,734 --> 00:38:44,128
Well, you're safe.

584
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:46,193
You know, predictable.

585
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:51,137
You'd never do anything, like,
outrageous.

586
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,182
Thanks.

587
00:39:11,547 --> 00:39:13,201
We're here.

588
00:39:14,463 --> 00:39:16,073
Get out.

589
00:39:16,117 --> 00:39:19,226
You said you'd drop me at the
mall.

590
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,450
- I've got to do some work.
- Where?

591
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:27,974
Look, none of your business
where!

592
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:29,957
Listen, Sam.

593
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,220
If your mom asks,

594
00:39:32,263 --> 00:39:36,463
- I took you to the mall, OK?
- Why?

595
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:41,466
Because I'm telling you,
that's...

596
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:43,492
that's why.

597
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,801
20 bucks.

598
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:51,595
Cool. Catch you later.

599
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:58,550
What am I doing?

600
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:38,044
Get out, you animal!

601
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:40,264
Cassie, I got him!

602
00:40:40,288 --> 00:40:42,701
- You touch me...
- What is it?

603
00:40:42,725 --> 00:40:44,572
Wait! I know him!

604
00:40:44,596 --> 00:40:47,662
I don't care! These pudgy
ones are most dangerous.

605
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:49,273
I'll be watching for you!

606
00:40:49,297 --> 00:40:52,406
- See how she was jabbing
it?- I know you less than a day...

607
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,062
and I save your ass twice.
You shouldn't spy on me.

608
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:58,021
- I wasn't.
- What were you doing?

609
00:40:58,045 --> 00:41:02,832
I was... I came here to...

610
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:05,332
to thank you for helping me last night.

611
00:41:05,356 --> 00:41:07,291
Oh. You're welcome.

612
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:10,294
Sit down. Let me see that hand. Come here.

613
00:41:10,318 --> 00:41:12,146
Oh.

614
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:14,950
- You have a tetanus shot recently?
- Why?

615
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,849
Just wondering.

616
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:22,610
It was weird... being
at your house last night.

617
00:41:22,634 --> 00:41:26,353
I felt I knew everybody by name,
but last night they all got faces.

618
00:41:26,377 --> 00:41:29,095
You never seen any of us before?

619
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,446
Well... Frank. Everybody's seen Frank.

620
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,516
Mr Congeniality?

621
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:44,439
What about me? You ever see me
before?

622
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:47,548
I've seen your truck around
town.

623
00:41:47,572 --> 00:41:50,856
Usually you'd be way up in some tree.

624
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,273
Yeah.

625
00:41:52,316 --> 00:41:55,034
One time, though, you dropped
your glove.

626
00:41:55,058 --> 00:42:00,218
- I picked it up and gave it to you.
- Yeah?

627
00:42:00,498 --> 00:42:03,240
Sorry.

628
00:42:03,284 --> 00:42:05,895
- What?
- Nothing.

629
00:42:05,938 --> 00:42:08,027
What?

630
00:42:08,071 --> 00:42:11,398
- You remind me of your
father.- I'm nothing like him.

631
00:42:11,422 --> 00:42:13,547
Whatever you say.

632
00:42:15,644 --> 00:42:19,964
What was your relationship with him?

633
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:23,758
What if I told you he made me
promise never to tell anyone?

634
00:42:23,782 --> 00:42:25,697
I'm his son.

635
00:42:25,741 --> 00:42:28,116
Especially his son.

636
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,374
- He said you'd be the first to ask.
- He didn't.

637
00:42:30,398 --> 00:42:33,290
- Cassie!
- I'll be right there, Sally.

638
00:42:33,314 --> 00:42:36,031
How come he told you all this
stuff?

639
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:38,295
Maybe I'm a good listener.

640
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,210
- Yeah?
- Comes with the job.

641
00:42:40,234 --> 00:42:42,845
You'll live.

642
00:42:44,151 --> 00:42:49,001
Next time... use the front
door like everybody else.

643
00:42:49,025 --> 00:42:50,896
Yeah. OK.

644
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,704
- How's Mom?
- Pretty good.

645
00:42:56,728 --> 00:42:59,229
Listen. Unsworth wants to meet
with me.

646
00:42:59,253 --> 00:43:03,755
I told him to come to the wake. I
figured I'd have a position of power.

647
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:08,194
- That's not bad. Did you think of that?
- Yeah.

648
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,437
No.

649
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,023
It was BJ's idea.

650
00:43:11,047 --> 00:43:15,419
I thought so.- I am trying, for God’s sake.

651
00:43:15,443 --> 00:43:19,883
I even talked to Frank about
baseball.

652
00:43:21,753 --> 00:43:25,385
Don't bullshit me.
I know what you're doing.

653
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:28,083
- Kiss me. My mother's looking.- What?

654
00:43:28,107 --> 00:43:32,427
My whole family's here. Just
kiss me.

655
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,602
You son of a bitch.

656
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:53,560
If you're not back in less than an hour,
I'll rip your eyeballs out.

657
00:43:56,048 --> 00:43:57,136
Bye!

658
00:43:57,180 --> 00:43:59,226
Have fun.

659
00:44:00,009 --> 00:44:01,880
Love you.

660
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,666
Love you!

661
00:44:09,018 --> 00:44:12,378
Oh, look. This must be Nora.

662
00:44:15,372 --> 00:44:23,372
Just what I need to feel totally worthless.
Saint Nora, the perfect child.

663
00:44:29,125 --> 00:44:32,365
- Nora?
- Over here, Johnny.

664
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,934
- Are you still a nun?
- Of course I'm still a nun.

665
00:44:35,958 --> 00:44:38,110
I worked with the poor
for three years.

666
00:44:38,134 --> 00:44:40,884
- Where?
- El Salvador.

667
00:44:43,226 --> 00:44:47,337
- What kind of poor?
- What kind do you think, Francis?

668
00:44:47,361 --> 00:44:50,427
Thank God you haven't changed.
You're still handsome.

669
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:52,864
Here. Help me with my bags.

670
00:44:52,888 --> 00:44:55,258
- Hey, big sister.
- Hi.

671
00:44:55,282 --> 00:44:57,085
- You got red hair.
- Yeah.

672
00:44:57,109 --> 00:45:01,394
- Nice jacket. How much did it cost?
- Good to see you too, Nora.

673
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:05,335
Enrique. Mi familia. Family.

674
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:07,337
Enrique.

675
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:12,231
Johnny, you still a gardener?

676
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:14,407
- I'm an arborist.
- An arborist?

677
00:45:14,431 --> 00:45:17,932
Maybe you could give
Enrique something to do. Keep him busy.

678
00:45:17,956 --> 00:45:23,476
GO WITH MY BROTHER.
HE'S SMARTER THAN HE LOOKS.

679
00:45:23,527 --> 00:45:26,574
Oh. It's Peter. Oh, God.

680
00:45:27,052 --> 00:45:34,492
- I gotta pick out a headstone.-
Think of it as accessorizing.

681
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,300
- Mom inside?
- Yeah.

682
00:45:43,417 --> 00:45:46,396
I can't believe this place is
still open.

683
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:49,007
I practically lived here as a
kid.

684
00:45:49,031 --> 00:45:52,631
Look over your right shoulder.

685
00:45:56,255 --> 00:45:59,563
Oh, God. Sheila Pajoli.

686
00:46:01,173 --> 00:46:04,283
- You used to go with her.
- She dumped me.

687
00:46:04,307 --> 00:46:06,633
She stole Freddie Balboni from
me.

688
00:46:06,657 --> 00:46:10,420
- That's cos she put out.
- So did I.

689
00:46:10,444 --> 00:46:13,074
She's coming over.Shit.

690
00:46:13,098 --> 00:46:16,339
- Why did we come here?
- Destiny.

691
00:46:16,363 --> 00:46:20,560
- Hey, Petey-boy! How you doing?-
Hey. Remember Terry Scanlan?

692
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:23,152
Terry Scanlan.

693
00:46:23,195 --> 00:46:26,479
Are you really here or am
I having an acid flashback?

694
00:46:26,503 --> 00:46:28,046
I'm really here.

695
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:33,230
Right. I heard about your
father. I'm sorry.

696
00:46:34,642 --> 00:46:37,490
Well, if you'll excuse me for a moment,

697
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:39,666
I'll let you two ladies talk.

698
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:42,440
I'm gonna take a leak.

699
00:46:50,658 --> 00:46:56,422
Jeez. What does he do
when he's gonna take a shit?

700
00:46:56,446 --> 00:47:00,687
- Did he bring you in to make me suffer?
- I think that's the general plan.

701
00:47:00,711 --> 00:47:04,082
Well, he never forgave me
for dumping him.

702
00:47:04,106 --> 00:47:05,823
Petey's all right, though.

703
00:47:05,847 --> 00:47:11,263
Prison's good for some guys.
Makes them appreciate women.

704
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:16,327
- You still with that dancer?
- I left him.

705
00:47:17,728 --> 00:47:21,360
- He left me.
- Same difference.

706
00:47:21,384 --> 00:47:24,972
What am I supposed to do?
Hang around and look devastated?

707
00:47:24,996 --> 00:47:28,976
Yeah. I think it'd make him feel
great.

708
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,806
Every dog's got its
day. I guess this is his.

709
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:35,548
- You look good.
- So do you.

710
00:47:35,572 --> 00:47:38,116
- Oh, God.
- Come on. You do. You look great.

711
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,510
Please. I look like hell.

712
00:47:40,534 --> 00:47:45,574
My only hope is to marry a
plastic surgeon.

713
00:47:53,416 --> 00:47:56,221
- Dance with me.
- Get outta here.

714
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:58,528
- Come on.
- I'm not dancing with you.

715
00:47:58,552 --> 00:48:03,232
Terry, don't leave me hanging
like this.

716
00:48:18,572 --> 00:48:21,899
- Sheila looking?
- Yeah, she's looking.

717
00:48:21,923 --> 00:48:23,315
Good.

718
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:27,559
- She look pissed?
- She's steaming.

719
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,193
Great.

720
00:48:45,642 --> 00:48:47,775
Anyone asks...

721
00:48:48,471 --> 00:48:50,580
we trimmed a few hedges here.
OK?

722
00:48:50,604 --> 00:48:52,277
What are you doing here?

723
00:48:52,301 --> 00:48:56,760
I saw your hedges needed
trimming. I brought my best man.

724
00:48:56,784 --> 00:48:59,023
You can help me while he's doing that.

725
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:00,483
Right.

726
00:49:00,527 --> 00:49:03,027
- Corta la matas.
- Sí.

727
00:49:03,051 --> 00:49:06,421
Shut up. Just trim the damn bushes,
will you?

728
00:49:06,445 --> 00:49:07,814
Where we going?

729
00:49:07,838 --> 00:49:10,213
You're a communist?

730
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:13,516
I'm not a communist.

731
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:16,997
- I'm a liberation theologian.
- Oh. Excuse me.

732
00:49:17,021 --> 00:49:19,826
- But you're still a nun?- Yes,
I'm still a nun, Mother.

733
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:23,308
But this way I help people more
than by just praying for them.

734
00:49:23,332 --> 00:49:25,179
By organizing hit squads?

735
00:49:25,203 --> 00:49:27,138
I don't understand.

736
00:49:27,162 --> 00:49:30,402
Let me try to explain this.

737
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:34,014
OK. So one day
I'm praying praying, praying.

738
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:37,365
And then I read the Sermon on
the Mount.

739
00:49:37,389 --> 00:49:39,803
For the first time it makes
sense to me.

740
00:49:39,827 --> 00:49:43,371
It doesn't say put up with the poor,
or patronize them.

741
00:49:43,395 --> 00:49:51,395
It doesn't try to change them. All
it says is, "Blessed are the poor."

742
00:49:52,317 --> 00:49:55,383
- Do you understand?
- I understand.

743
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:57,995
The rank and file
hears my sister's a bolshevik,

744
00:49:58,019 --> 00:50:01,739
I'm finished. I understand
that.

745
00:50:03,502 --> 00:50:10,702
I have no idea what you're doing,
but I think it's wonderful.

746
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:13,401
Who are you guys?

747
00:50:13,425 --> 00:50:16,535
Immigration and naturalization.

748
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:20,278
We're looking for Enrique
Hernandez.

749
00:50:20,302 --> 00:50:24,262
- Who?
- We're having a wake here.

750
00:50:24,872 --> 00:50:27,067
Show a little respect.

751
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,466
Goodbye, gentlemen.

752
00:50:32,401 --> 00:50:35,162
Why didn't you pull out your
Uzi and mow them down?

753
00:50:35,186 --> 00:50:39,746
Francis, you watch too much
television.

754
00:50:40,322 --> 00:50:42,193
That was her.

755
00:50:48,547 --> 00:50:51,483
- I made a big decision.
- You're doing better than me.

756
00:50:51,507 --> 00:50:54,529
- I'm gonna leave my wife.
- No, you're not.

757
00:50:54,553 --> 00:50:55,922
Yes, I am.

758
00:50:55,946 --> 00:50:58,708
Your father said you'd be lost
without your wife.

759
00:50:58,732 --> 00:51:02,276
That shows how much he
didn't know me. I'd made plans.

760
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,888
- You tell your wife yet?
- No.

761
00:51:04,912 --> 00:51:08,413
- Then you haven't done anything.
- What do you mean?

762
00:51:08,437 --> 00:51:13,113
I'm gonna sell the business
and... I'm gonna buy a boat.

763
00:51:13,137 --> 00:51:16,987
I might even build a boat. A
50-footer. Do you like boats?

764
00:51:17,011 --> 00:51:22,166
Every time a man goes on a boat,
his IQ drops by half.

765
00:51:22,190 --> 00:51:26,039
I'm not talking about a bear and bass boat.

766
00:51:26,063 --> 00:51:28,912
I'm talking about the real
thing.

767
00:51:28,936 --> 00:51:30,696
What's wrong with your wife?

768
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,743
Nothing. She just doesn't
wanna go with me.

769
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:36,746
There's nothing between us any
more.

770
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:39,618
There's no passion. There's no
risk.

771
00:51:39,642 --> 00:51:44,082
Everything's become so tame, so safe.

772
00:51:44,603 --> 00:51:52,603
Her idea of danger is to go out at
night and not leave the phone machine on.

773
00:51:53,395 --> 00:51:55,982
I wanna be scared again.

774
00:51:56,006 --> 00:51:58,768
Then check out the price on this dress.

775
00:51:58,792 --> 00:52:02,597
What do you think?
Is it too sexy for a funeral.

776
00:52:02,621 --> 00:52:04,687
Anything you wear is sexy.

777
00:52:04,711 --> 00:52:07,951
You are a flirt, just like your father.

778
00:52:07,975 --> 00:52:11,781
No, no, I'm not. I'm terrible at flirting.

779
00:52:11,805 --> 00:52:13,981
- Unzip.
- What?

780
00:52:14,024 --> 00:52:16,924
- The dress.
- Oh, right.

781
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:18,918
There you go. Yeah.

782
00:52:18,942 --> 00:52:22,772
You know, I... I envy you.

783
00:52:24,034 --> 00:52:25,882
You have freedom.

784
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:29,973
You can do anything you want.
Go anywhere you want.

785
00:52:29,997 --> 00:52:32,236
Who told you that?

786
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,566
Let's go.

787
00:52:35,176 --> 00:52:37,589
You're not gonna buy it?

788
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,418
- Too expensive for a working girl.
- Come on.

789
00:52:40,442 --> 00:52:41,724
What are you doing?

790
00:52:41,748 --> 00:52:43,508
- I'm gonna buy it for you.
- Why?

791
00:52:43,532 --> 00:52:46,119
- Cos I want to.
- You're crazy.

792
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:50,820
Maybe. Excuse me. How much is this dress,
please?

793
00:52:50,844 --> 00:52:51,932
£375.

794
00:52:52,715 --> 00:52:54,824
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

795
00:52:54,848 --> 00:52:57,328
Cash? Or charge?

796
00:52:57,372 --> 00:52:59,243
Cash.

797
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:01,637
Of course.

798
00:53:08,078 --> 00:53:12,711
- Did Boyd make it back home?
- No, he didn't.

799
00:53:12,735 --> 00:53:17,295
What about this one? I think
it's nice.

800
00:53:19,307 --> 00:53:23,940
It's ugly. Looks like the horse is
gonna piss all over the grave.

801
00:53:23,964 --> 00:53:26,856
- What are these brats doing?
- They're angels.

802
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,033
- With dicks?
- Little ones.

803
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:33,417
What catechism did you read?

804
00:53:33,974 --> 00:53:35,714
What?

805
00:53:35,758 --> 00:53:39,738
Boyd and you, you're not really together
any more, are you?

806
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:42,741
No, we're not together
any more. We're divorced.

807
00:53:42,765 --> 00:53:47,877
They're dedicating a volume to us
in the Time-Life series on divorce.

808
00:53:47,901 --> 00:53:51,576
- Why did you bring him?
- For my mother, my family.

809
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,404
- I thought they hated him.
- They do.

810
00:53:53,428 --> 00:53:58,496
They consider the institution
of marriage more important than the players.

811
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:00,827
Like baseball.

812
00:54:01,828 --> 00:54:04,154
If I told my mother, it'd kill her.

813
00:54:04,178 --> 00:54:08,506
- You're not worried about your mother.
- I'm not?

814
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:11,204
No. You didn't drag him back
here for her.

815
00:54:11,228 --> 00:54:12,684
Who for, then?

816
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,294
- For you.
- For me?

817
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:16,731
- You're embarrassed.
- About what?

818
00:54:16,755 --> 00:54:21,432
- I don't know. About failing.
- What are you talking about?

819
00:54:21,456 --> 00:54:25,218
You wanted to shock people and
married him to make your point,

820
00:54:25,242 --> 00:54:27,003
but the guy's a shit.

821
00:54:27,027 --> 00:54:29,657
Spare me the talk-show
psychology!

822
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:34,967
Miss Rebel! She lies to defend
marriage, the most bourgeois thing of all.

823
00:54:34,991 --> 00:54:37,970
Where did you learn "bourgeois"?

824
00:54:37,994 --> 00:54:41,844
What will you say next?
"Enchanté"? "Contraire"?

825
00:54:41,868 --> 00:54:45,412
- You know what the problem with you is?
- No! Tell me!

826
00:54:45,436 --> 00:54:48,415
- You take yourself too seriously.
- Is that right?

827
00:54:48,439 --> 00:54:50,591
You need someone
to make you laugh at yourself.

828
00:54:50,615 --> 00:54:53,618
Who's that gonna be? You?

829
00:54:53,662 --> 00:54:55,620
No.

830
00:55:01,061 --> 00:55:04,301
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

831
00:55:04,325 --> 00:55:09,306
- Which stone do you want?
- You know so much about me. Pick one.

832
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:14,490
Terry, I don't know
which tombstone to pick.

833
00:55:14,988 --> 00:55:17,251
Terry!

834
00:55:23,039 --> 00:55:26,192
This is nuts. It's outrageous.

835
00:55:26,216 --> 00:55:28,740
No, it's not.

836
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:31,004
Yes, it is.

837
00:55:31,047 --> 00:55:34,287
That's why you're doing it.

838
00:55:36,313 --> 00:55:38,857
Hi. Why aren't you at school?

839
00:55:38,881 --> 00:55:42,556
Nora's been calling me. I've
looked for you all afternoon.

840
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:45,603
- Yeah.- The Millers
said you didn't go to work.

841
00:55:45,627 --> 00:55:48,519
- I thought something had happened.
- I was at work.

842
00:55:48,543 --> 00:55:51,914
- Not with George.
- No, not with George.

843
00:55:51,938 --> 00:55:53,785
- Will you stand still?
- What?

844
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:58,790
What? You're like a pinball,
bouncing around all over the place.

845
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,859
Sit down.

846
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:02,209
OK.

847
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:06,667
What's the matter with you?

848
00:56:06,691 --> 00:56:12,456
- My father just died.
- It's more than that, Johnny.

849
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:14,806
Just talk to me, all right?

850
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:18,636
Don't give me that speech about the
lobster boats and the sea breeze.

851
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:21,682
Tell me what's going on, all
right?

852
00:56:21,706 --> 00:56:24,187
Are you unhappy?

853
00:56:24,231 --> 00:56:26,949
Is it me? Am I doing something
wrong?

854
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:33,651
- Of course not.
- I can carry things, but I'd like some help.

855
00:56:33,675 --> 00:56:35,783
Just let me in. Tell me what's
going on.

856
00:56:35,807 --> 00:56:38,656
- Talk to me.
- It's nothing.

857
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,267
All right. Fine. Don't talk to
me.

858
00:56:41,291 --> 00:56:45,837
- I want to ask you one question.
- Yes. I love you.

859
00:56:45,861 --> 00:56:48,535
That's not what I was going to
ask you.

860
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,679
I gotta go to my mother's.

861
00:56:55,566 --> 00:56:58,023
- Have a drink, Father.
- Thank you.

862
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,460
This is my first wake. It's very exciting.

863
00:57:00,484 --> 00:57:07,324
It's tragic, of course,
but in a theological sense it's...

864
00:57:15,151 --> 00:57:16,761
Holy shit!

865
00:57:18,676 --> 00:57:21,636
Oh, no. Excuse me.

866
00:57:21,679 --> 00:57:23,986
Hi, Dad.

867
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,182
- Mom and I came with Cassie.
- Cassie?

868
00:57:26,206 --> 00:57:28,271
- The woman with Mom.
- Oh, her.

869
00:57:28,295 --> 00:57:31,361
Her car broke down in the
gas station. We gave her a ride.

870
00:57:31,385 --> 00:57:35,234
- She says she knows you.
- Everybody knows me.

871
00:57:35,258 --> 00:57:40,898
Boyd, please don't go.
It's only one more night.

872
00:57:41,047 --> 00:57:44,113
I can't take another minute
of your mood swings.

873
00:57:44,137 --> 00:57:47,029
Simpering one moment, snarling
the next.

874
00:57:47,053 --> 00:57:50,423
Oh, God, what am I gonna tell my mother?

875
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:52,710
I don't care!

876
00:57:57,672 --> 00:58:01,391
You know what, Boyd? My father
was right.

877
00:58:01,415 --> 00:58:04,461
You're a shit!

878
00:58:09,640 --> 00:58:11,096
What are you staring at?

879
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:16,760
Don't you have a body
somewhere to go and stuff?

880
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:35,903
- Here they come.
- Relax, Francis. Button your coat.

881
00:58:35,927 --> 00:58:38,104
Relax.

882
00:58:43,196 --> 00:58:45,174
Francis Scanlan?

883
00:58:45,198 --> 00:58:46,808
Yes.

884
00:58:46,851 --> 00:58:51,963
Mr Unsworth would like to
talk to you in his car a minute.

885
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:56,098
You tell Mr Unsworth that the
rank and file will take it as an insult

886
00:58:56,122 --> 00:59:02,362
if he doesn't come in and
pay his respects to my dad.

887
00:59:07,133 --> 00:59:09,744
Nice going, Francis.

888
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,479
You were right, OK? You win.

889
00:59:29,503 --> 00:59:32,830
I brought him back here
for me. No-one else. Me.

890
00:59:32,854 --> 00:59:35,615
I hate being wrong and
being told "I told you so".

891
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:39,967
I was wrong to my father and now he’s
dead and I'm wrong and he's right.

892
00:59:39,991 --> 00:59:43,928
I hate that you figured it
out. Am I that transparent?

893
00:59:43,952 --> 00:59:47,236
- No. I'm remarkably perceptive.- Oh!

894
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,281
Do you know what you are?

895
00:59:49,305 --> 00:59:53,242
You are everything I ran away
from in this insipid little burg.

896
00:59:53,266 --> 01:00:00,706
Everything small, narrow-minded,
insignificant and bush league.

897
01:00:13,503 --> 01:00:16,403
Close the door, Froggie.

898
01:00:18,552 --> 01:00:22,967
No-one's dared call me that
since I was ten.

899
01:00:22,991 --> 01:00:25,616
I was talking to him.

900
01:00:32,348 --> 01:00:35,936
- Tell us where he is.
- Do you have a warrant?

901
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,832
Come on.

902
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,034
- Cassie. Listen to me.
- Not now. I'm praying.

903
01:00:47,058 --> 01:00:48,930
I love you.

904
01:00:48,973 --> 01:00:54,346
- I love you too, Johnny.
- No, I mean I love you that way.

905
01:00:54,370 --> 01:00:57,262
- Which way?
- The other way.

906
01:00:57,286 --> 01:01:01,658
At first I thought it was because
I was intrigued by what you were.

907
01:01:01,682 --> 01:01:04,878
- Tell me I'm not hearing this.-
Then it became something else.

908
01:01:04,902 --> 01:01:06,880
- Slow down.
- I looked at you today

909
01:01:06,904 --> 01:01:11,450
and thought, "This is someone who
could play a role in my new life."

910
01:01:11,474 --> 01:01:14,888
- What role? What new life?
- Someone I could start again with.

911
01:01:14,912 --> 01:01:16,586
- What about your wife?
- Amy?

912
01:01:16,610 --> 01:01:18,979
Remember Amy? Your wife?

913
01:01:19,003 --> 01:01:21,808
I love Amy. But not like this.

914
01:01:21,832 --> 01:01:24,898
- Was it the dress?- I
know what you're gonna say.

915
01:01:24,922 --> 01:01:28,511
- Good, because I don't.-
Couldn't you tell how I felt?

916
01:01:28,535 --> 01:01:33,167
Yeah, I thought, "Maybe he's
got a crush on me." Big deal.

917
01:01:33,191 --> 01:01:37,781
That kind of thing happens.
Especially when someone's in a state...

918
01:01:37,805 --> 01:01:40,479
I didn't think you'd ask me
to run away with you.

919
01:01:40,503 --> 01:01:42,568
- That's what you're asking me.- Yeah.

920
01:01:42,592 --> 01:01:45,963
- Are you crazy? This is nuts!
- I know it is!

921
01:01:45,987 --> 01:01:49,619
- Will you get a hold of yourself?
- I can't explain it.

922
01:01:49,643 --> 01:01:53,013
That's a good rule. You can't
explain something, don't do it!

923
01:01:53,037 --> 01:01:56,278
- Johnny, we're in trouble.
- Not now, I'm praying.

924
01:01:56,302 --> 01:01:57,564
Oh...

925
01:01:57,607 --> 01:01:59,392
Right. Listen.

926
01:01:59,435 --> 01:02:01,239
Enrique's an illegal.

927
01:02:01,263 --> 01:02:03,894
So what? Half the guys
that work for me are.

928
01:02:03,918 --> 01:02:06,157
No, he's really illegal.

929
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:09,421
He's a big shot in the underground
railroad. INS agents are here.

930
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:12,119
What, now? In this house?

931
01:02:12,143 --> 01:02:14,644
- They're gonna pull the place apart.
- Great.

932
01:02:14,668 --> 01:02:17,299
You turn Mom's house
into Uncle Tom's Cabin.

933
01:02:17,323 --> 01:02:19,126
Why don't we just turn him in?

934
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:21,999
Does the name Judas
mean anything to you?

935
01:02:22,023 --> 01:02:23,957
Let me explain something.

936
01:02:23,981 --> 01:02:27,134
If he gets caught here,
the owner of the house gets arrested.

937
01:02:27,158 --> 01:02:30,964
Perfect! Mom can go to the
funeral with a parole officer.

938
01:02:30,988 --> 01:02:33,077
Where is he?

939
01:02:37,647 --> 01:02:41,172
Oh! Oh, God!

940
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:43,827
Oh, God!

941
01:02:43,871 --> 01:02:48,791
She adored her father so much.
Poor thing.

942
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:53,010
Oh, God!

943
01:02:56,231 --> 01:03:01,031
- We have to hide him somewhere.- Where?

944
01:03:02,977 --> 01:03:05,109
Oh, no.

945
01:03:07,634 --> 01:03:08,634
Shit.

946
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:27,064
Get it in. All right. Stand
still.

947
01:03:27,088 --> 01:03:30,448
- Here.
- Métete en el cofre.

948
01:03:30,657 --> 01:03:33,636
- Oh, no!
- Put him in. Come on.

949
01:03:33,660 --> 01:03:36,271
- All right.
- Stay.

950
01:03:36,314 --> 01:03:40,860
- Where's the baby powder?
- Gracias, señorita.

951
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:43,123
That's my position, Mr Unsworth.

952
01:03:43,147 --> 01:03:47,867
And the rank and file are fully behind him.

953
01:03:47,891 --> 01:03:50,641
So, what do you think?

954
01:03:51,721 --> 01:03:53,854
What do I think?

955
01:03:53,897 --> 01:03:59,076
I think you're exceptionally
obtuse.

956
01:04:01,252 --> 01:04:03,341
Well, thank you.

957
01:04:06,301 --> 01:04:09,609
Obtuse means stupid.

958
01:04:11,393 --> 01:04:16,461
Fuck you. My father worked his
way up to the head of this union.

959
01:04:16,485 --> 01:04:21,292
You see where the flags at city hall
are flying? At half-mast. For him.

960
01:04:21,316 --> 01:04:24,687
They fly half-mast
when the school janitor dies.

961
01:04:24,711 --> 01:04:27,385
Spare the maudlin bullshit.

962
01:04:27,409 --> 01:04:31,476
I have your pension money buried so deep

963
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,000
it'll take you ten years to find it.

964
01:04:34,024 --> 01:04:39,484
If your loyal rank and file
think you've lost their money,

965
01:04:39,508 --> 01:04:45,534
they'll be on their knees
in front of me in no time.

966
01:04:45,558 --> 01:04:49,102
- My father was loved...
- Your father was a dinosaur.

967
01:04:49,126 --> 01:04:51,501
And you're his egg.

968
01:04:53,827 --> 01:04:56,849
But admittedly a popular one.

969
01:04:56,873 --> 01:04:59,702
So, here's my offer.

970
01:04:59,746 --> 01:05:02,357
Me, I'm boss.

971
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,926
You, you're a PR type,

972
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:08,731
where you can flash those pearly whites

973
01:05:08,755 --> 01:05:12,759
and that low-budget Kennedy
charm.

974
01:05:12,802 --> 01:05:14,476
Nice salary, perks.

975
01:05:14,500 --> 01:05:20,260
But you don't wipe your ass
unless I tell you to.

976
01:05:21,681 --> 01:05:24,031
That's my offer.

977
01:05:24,074 --> 01:05:26,574
Take it or leave it.

978
01:05:56,150 --> 01:05:58,345
- Could you close the doors, please?
- Why?

979
01:05:58,369 --> 01:06:01,369
Close the door, will you?

980
01:06:37,191 --> 01:06:39,473
There's no-one here.

981
01:06:39,497 --> 01:06:42,247
Let's try the kitchen.

982
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:08,807
- I can't believe this. Watch the table!
- Let's talk later.

983
01:07:08,831 --> 01:07:11,984
- Listen to what you're
saying!- I don't do this every day!

984
01:07:12,008 --> 01:07:14,944
- Watch his head!
- He's trying to seduce you.

985
01:07:14,968 --> 01:07:18,382
- Keep out of this!
- He looks goofy when he tries to be sexy.

986
01:07:18,406 --> 01:07:19,557
Shut up!

987
01:07:19,581 --> 01:07:21,690
- Come on.
- In my room.

988
01:07:21,714 --> 01:07:23,063
Yeah.

989
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:24,847
Watch it!

990
01:07:24,891 --> 01:07:28,044
- Come on.
- Oh, my God, it's my father!

991
01:07:28,068 --> 01:07:30,046
- Keep it down!
- I'll put a pillow here.

992
01:07:30,070 --> 01:07:34,311
- What's going on?
- What the hell are you doing?

993
01:07:34,335 --> 01:07:38,489
- You were having sex, weren’t you?
- No!

994
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:41,971
- Oh, God!
- At your father's wake?

995
01:07:41,995 --> 01:07:45,355
What is it with this family?

996
01:07:47,827 --> 01:07:50,719
Don't panic. I've heard
about things like this.

997
01:07:50,743 --> 01:07:52,851
It's a muscle reaction. They
happen.

998
01:07:52,875 --> 01:07:54,592
Hold on to his legs!

999
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:58,422
- I'll never have sex again. I swear.
- Fat chance.

1000
01:07:58,446 --> 01:08:00,642
Why did you bring him in here
anyway?

1001
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:03,949
We put Enrique in the casket because
the INS agents are after him.

1002
01:08:03,973 --> 01:08:08,867
- What INS agents?
- They're looking for her Salvadoran.

1003
01:08:08,891 --> 01:08:11,783
- Who are you?
- Don't ask.

1004
01:08:11,807 --> 01:08:15,787
Wait a minute. You mean
there are agents in this house?

1005
01:08:15,811 --> 01:08:18,790
You mean cops? After you?

1006
01:08:18,814 --> 01:08:21,227
You broke the law? You?

1007
01:08:21,251 --> 01:08:23,558
Oh, I love it!

1008
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:33,190
They're starting the final
prayer downstairs.

1009
01:08:33,786 --> 01:08:35,309
Enrique!

1010
01:08:41,054 --> 01:08:43,772
Let's get downstairs. Come on.

1011
01:08:43,796 --> 01:08:47,819
- Don't let anybody near that body.
- We'll be right here.

1012
01:08:47,843 --> 01:08:51,281
Instead of a prayer, Mrs...

1013
01:08:52,979 --> 01:08:56,199
- Scanlan.
- ..Scanlan...

1014
01:08:56,243 --> 01:08:59,843
...has asked that Daniel sing.

1015
01:09:04,425 --> 01:09:08,927
The first time I ever sang this song was
at Jack and Mary's wedding.

1016
01:09:08,951 --> 01:09:12,452
I was a lot younger than them.

1017
01:09:12,476 --> 01:09:18,356
Jack always said this song
made him think of Mary.

1018
01:09:42,115 --> 01:09:44,571
- I love it! This is perfect.
- What's perfect?

1019
01:09:44,595 --> 01:09:47,836
All my life I've had to play
juvenile delinquent to your saint.

1020
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:50,752
Always compared to you.
"You should be more like Nora."

1021
01:09:50,776 --> 01:09:53,711
- "Your sister would never do that."
- Oh, grow up!

1022
01:09:53,735 --> 01:09:57,019
Now you're dragging your doting father’s
body through the house

1023
01:09:57,043 --> 01:09:59,151
so the feds don't nail you.

1024
01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:01,763
Are you seeing this, Dad? Are
you?

1025
01:10:01,787 --> 01:10:05,244
- Well, finally I'm vindicated.- Oh,
come on!

1026
01:10:05,268 --> 01:10:09,727
I'm not the one caught
fornicating with my boyfriend.

1027
01:10:09,751 --> 01:10:14,911
Typical. So smug.
So self-righteous. So you.

1028
01:10:15,104 --> 01:10:17,126
- You know what I should do?
- What?

1029
01:10:17,150 --> 01:10:18,910
- I should turn you in.
- Yeah?

1030
01:10:18,934 --> 01:10:22,000
Yeah. I should go
and tell the cops everything

1031
01:10:22,024 --> 01:10:24,002
and nail your holy ass to the
wall.

1032
01:10:24,026 --> 01:10:27,179
- Go on, then. Do it.
- Don't push me. I will.

1033
01:10:27,203 --> 01:10:29,828
- I dare you.
- Go on.

1034
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:34,119
Who's that?

1035
01:10:41,696 --> 01:10:48,176
It's my Uncle Jerry. He
had a little too much to drink.

1036
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:51,732
Do you mind?

1037
01:10:58,495 --> 01:11:03,476
- They're all frigging drunks.
- He's not here. Let's go.

1038
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,068
- Ter...
- Don't.

1039
01:11:15,208 --> 01:11:18,796
I can't believe I had you where I've
always wanted you and let you go.

1040
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:21,233
I can't believe
you were having sex with him.

1041
01:11:21,257 --> 01:11:23,257
Give me a break!

1042
01:12:29,021 --> 01:12:31,086
- I've got a ride home.
- Oh.

1043
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:34,828
Let's get Enrique out of the casket.
His contacts will be here in an hour.

1044
01:12:34,852 --> 01:12:36,376
What?

1045
01:12:55,786 --> 01:12:59,505
- Wasn't that lovely?
- It was unforgettable.

1046
01:12:59,529 --> 01:13:01,488
Mrs Cassidy.

1047
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:04,815
- You knew my father really well.
- Very well.

1048
01:13:04,839 --> 01:13:08,123
You know his mistress was here
tonight?

1049
01:13:08,147 --> 01:13:10,018
Yes, I do.

1050
01:13:10,062 --> 01:13:12,344
This is a time of healing.

1051
01:13:12,368 --> 01:13:15,478
I think we should rid
ourselves of all reproach.

1052
01:13:15,502 --> 01:13:18,127
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

1053
01:13:18,505 --> 01:13:21,527
Could you give her this message for me,
please?

1054
01:13:21,551 --> 01:13:23,640
Thank you.

1055
01:13:28,254 --> 01:13:32,934
Wait a minute. Her car's in the garage.

1056
01:13:39,743 --> 01:13:42,592
- What are you doing here?
- Didn't you get my note?

1057
01:13:42,616 --> 01:13:45,073
- What note?
- Jesus Christ!

1058
01:13:45,097 --> 01:13:47,423
Who did she give my key to?

1059
01:13:47,447 --> 01:13:51,647
You better get down here, will you?

1060
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:57,607
No way. I am not going
to any motel with you.

1061
01:13:57,631 --> 01:14:00,305
- I just wanna talk.
- You ever hear of the telephone?

1062
01:14:00,329 --> 01:14:02,873
- Did you think about what I said?
- No.

1063
01:14:02,897 --> 01:14:04,831
I shouldn't be in this truck
with you.

1064
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:07,486
It's been a nightmare. Your
family's crazy.

1065
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,749
- That's what I want to get away from.
- So go.

1066
01:14:09,773 --> 01:14:12,491
- With you.
- Don't take this personally,

1067
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:15,233
but I've told you already, I
have a life here.

1068
01:14:15,257 --> 01:14:17,801
Have a nice night.
I can get home by myself.

1069
01:14:17,825 --> 01:14:24,808
What are you saying? My father was
good enough for you but I’m not?

1070
01:14:24,832 --> 01:14:27,724
What are you talking about?

1071
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:30,466
I know what you were to my
father.

1072
01:14:30,490 --> 01:14:33,121
What? What was I to your father?

1073
01:14:33,145 --> 01:14:38,065
- Everybody knows.
- Everybody knows what?

1074
01:14:38,367 --> 01:14:41,675
That you were his mistress.

1075
01:14:41,718 --> 01:14:43,968
You're kidding me.

1076
01:14:44,417 --> 01:14:47,537
Tell me you're kidding me.

1077
01:14:48,769 --> 01:14:50,703
He had women all his life.

1078
01:14:50,727 --> 01:14:55,602
They think that I was his...
mistress?

1079
01:14:57,082 --> 01:14:59,301
Oh, man!

1080
01:14:59,345 --> 01:15:02,465
That really pisses me off.

1081
01:15:02,826 --> 01:15:05,327
And you thought that too?

1082
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:09,940
What am I saying? You're
handing me from one generation to the next

1083
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:12,160
like the family recipe for baked
beans!

1084
01:15:12,184 --> 01:15:15,989
- I love you.
- And who will love me after you?

1085
01:15:16,013 --> 01:15:18,190
Frank? Your son?

1086
01:15:18,233 --> 01:15:20,168
I wasn't your father's mistress.

1087
01:15:20,192 --> 01:15:23,519
- You were his daughter?
- No, you stupid shit!

1088
01:15:23,543 --> 01:15:27,000
My mother worked for the
union. She died when I was nine.

1089
01:15:27,024 --> 01:15:29,133
My father left before I was
born.

1090
01:15:29,157 --> 01:15:34,269
Your father pulled some strings so my
grandmother got more pension money.

1091
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:36,271
- Will you...
- We became friends.

1092
01:15:36,295 --> 01:15:40,275
He talked me into staying in school,
lent me money for the shop.

1093
01:15:40,299 --> 01:15:42,233
- Cassie...
- I went to him for advice.

1094
01:15:42,257 --> 01:15:45,628
He was always there for me
and never laid a hand on me.

1095
01:15:45,652 --> 01:15:48,674
He never even kissed me
except on the cheek.

1096
01:15:48,698 --> 01:15:51,416
His mistress? I don't believe
this.

1097
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:54,139
Jesus Christ!

1098
01:15:55,052 --> 01:15:57,272
Johnny?

1099
01:15:57,316 --> 01:15:59,468
- Johnny!
- Mrs Cassidy!

1100
01:15:59,492 --> 01:16:02,601
- Is that you?
- What are you doing here?

1101
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:06,910
- You gave me the note.
- To give to my father's mistress.

1102
01:16:06,934 --> 01:16:10,414
I was your father's mistress.

1103
01:16:10,981 --> 01:16:13,395
Oh, Christ. Look, get in the
truck.

1104
01:16:13,419 --> 01:16:17,225
It was a brief affair.
Eisenhower was president.

1105
01:16:17,249 --> 01:16:21,098
We would go into the bomb
shelter and have martinis.

1106
01:16:21,122 --> 01:16:24,580
- He called me Buttercup.
- I don't want to listen to this.

1107
01:16:24,604 --> 01:16:27,713
I confessed to your mother
and she forgave me.

1108
01:16:27,737 --> 01:16:29,889
- Cassie!
- Don't worry about me.

1109
01:16:29,913 --> 01:16:35,913
- Cassie, wait, please.
- I can get home by myself.

1110
01:16:51,805 --> 01:16:55,524
We should have gotten the good
casket.

1111
01:16:55,548 --> 01:17:00,588
Boyd'd love this. 500 people all in black.

1112
01:17:30,931 --> 01:17:36,211
Does anyone have anything
they'd like to say?

1113
01:17:40,854 --> 01:17:42,116
Get up.

1114
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,342
I keep thinking about the time
I...

1115
01:18:14,366 --> 01:18:18,998
asked my grandfather
what heaven was like.

1116
01:18:19,022 --> 01:18:24,700
He said, "Heaven's a place
where your father's a boy

1117
01:18:24,724 --> 01:18:27,553
and your dog talks."

1118
01:18:28,554 --> 01:18:32,621
If my father's there now,
I only hope there's a smoking section.

1119
01:18:32,645 --> 01:18:34,753
He left some big shoes to fill.

1120
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:39,454
I've... I've got pretty small
feet myself.

1121
01:18:39,478 --> 01:18:44,328
We're just gonna have to learn
to do without him.

1122
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:46,977
We're gonna miss him.

1123
01:19:05,330 --> 01:19:11,355
How will you run for the senate if you
can't deliver a eulogy for your father?

1124
01:19:11,379 --> 01:19:13,662
We should try elocution lessons.

1125
01:19:13,686 --> 01:19:16,586
A very manly thing, Dad.

1126
01:19:25,741 --> 01:19:29,341
- Did you sleep with her?
- No.

1127
01:19:29,658 --> 01:19:34,338
What about the boat? Are you
going away?

1128
01:19:51,941 --> 01:19:54,833
What was that he was saying
about talking dogs?

1129
01:19:54,857 --> 01:19:59,142
This car's ridiculous. Look at
it. Decadent.

1130
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:03,276
Didn't anyone tell him they
don't have dogs in heaven?

1131
01:20:03,300 --> 01:20:05,627
How come you didn't say
anything about Grandpa?

1132
01:20:05,651 --> 01:20:07,585
I didn't feel like it.

1133
01:20:07,609 --> 01:20:12,808
Your father's been served
a healthy dose of reality.

1134
01:20:12,832 --> 01:20:15,463
You think I'm obtuse, don't you?

1135
01:20:15,487 --> 01:20:18,944
I know what people think
about me. They think I'm a joke.

1136
01:20:18,968 --> 01:20:20,859
No, they don't, Daddy.

1137
01:20:20,883 --> 01:20:22,537
Oh, really?

1138
01:20:22,581 --> 01:20:26,038
To top it all, my daughter
saunters down the aisle pregnant,

1139
01:20:26,062 --> 01:20:28,606
without a husband, like it's
normal.

1140
01:20:28,630 --> 01:20:31,990
I was completely humiliated.

1141
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,810
Well, I'm sorry.

1142
01:20:45,517 --> 01:20:48,476
Excuse me, who are you?

1143
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:51,880
I'm the father of her child.

1144
01:20:57,746 --> 01:20:59,507
Son of a bitch! I'll kill you!

1145
01:20:59,531 --> 01:21:00,967
Stop!

1146
01:21:01,010 --> 01:21:04,729
- You do this to my little girl?- Daddy,
stop it! Daddy!

1147
01:21:04,753 --> 01:21:09,313
Frank! Get control of yourself, Frank!

1148
01:21:13,414 --> 01:21:17,307
Could we have a little bit of privacy,
please? Maybe.

1149
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:19,178
Where would you like us to go?

1150
01:21:19,202 --> 01:21:24,242
Of course. We'll get out at the next stop.

1151
01:21:30,475 --> 01:21:33,782
Nice to meet you, Tom.

1152
01:21:34,391 --> 01:21:35,978
Where are you going?

1153
01:21:36,002 --> 01:21:38,720
- I just have to do something.
- Oh.

1154
01:21:38,744 --> 01:21:42,201
I've got to find a normal car.

1155
01:21:42,225 --> 01:21:43,975
Where's Peter?

1156
01:21:48,318 --> 01:21:52,385
You won't believe
who just popped into our car.

1157
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:57,089
We didn't have one of those in
our limo.

1158
01:21:59,678 --> 01:22:03,758
- What's going on?
- We gotta talk.

1159
01:22:05,597 --> 01:22:09,437
Mercedes. Worse than a
limousine.

1160
01:22:12,517 --> 01:22:16,597
- Hello.
- Nora, what's the matter?

1161
01:22:26,052 --> 01:22:28,620
- Where to?
- Funny.

1162
01:22:35,931 --> 01:22:39,389
Terry, come on,
you gotta tell your mother you're divorced.

1163
01:22:39,413 --> 01:22:42,435
- I'm not telling her I'm divorced.
- You have to tell her.

1164
01:22:42,459 --> 01:22:44,089
I have to tell her.

1165
01:22:44,113 --> 01:22:46,463
I can't. I will.

1166
01:22:46,507 --> 01:22:47,615
I can't.

1167
01:22:47,639 --> 01:22:51,239
I was pretty nasty last night.

1168
01:22:51,338 --> 01:22:53,558
I deserved it.

1169
01:22:55,211 --> 01:22:57,961
You're right, you did.

1170
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:04,806
I was just having coffee
with her. That's all. Coffee.

1171
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:09,898
Actually, it wasn't even coffee,
it was tea. Herbal tea.

1172
01:23:09,922 --> 01:23:12,857
She'd broken up with her
boyfriend and needed to talk.

1173
01:23:12,881 --> 01:23:14,990
- Sure.
- Honest. That's all.

1174
01:23:15,014 --> 01:23:17,451
I failed, Mom.

1175
01:23:17,494 --> 01:23:19,845
How did you fail?

1176
01:23:19,888 --> 01:23:22,780
I let him down. Everything he
worked for.

1177
01:23:22,804 --> 01:23:25,740
I was supposed to step in and
take over.

1178
01:23:25,764 --> 01:23:30,179
You have never disappointed me,
Francis Xavier Scanlan.

1179
01:23:30,203 --> 01:23:32,442
And you never will.

1180
01:23:32,466 --> 01:23:36,141
Now, we're burying your father
this morning. Life goes on.

1181
01:23:36,165 --> 01:23:38,666
Now, sit up and act like a man.

1182
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:44,810
That's what your father
would have wanted you to do.

1183
01:23:58,535 --> 01:24:00,731
He's thick as a brick.

1184
01:24:00,755 --> 01:24:03,908
But he's nice-looking, isn't he?

1185
01:24:03,932 --> 01:24:06,108
Beautiful teeth.

1186
01:24:13,202 --> 01:24:17,162
I wanna speak to my mother.
Alone.

1187
01:24:18,817 --> 01:24:21,447
Frank, we're in here, honey.

1188
01:24:21,471 --> 01:24:26,191
Would you get in the car? We've
got to talk about Rachel and Tom.

1189
01:24:26,215 --> 01:24:31,855
- Where?
- Take our car. We'll take another one.

1190
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:46,385
Hi. Can we get in?

1191
01:24:46,409 --> 01:24:48,284
- Sure.
- Great.

1192
01:24:53,242 --> 01:24:55,331
Oh.

1193
01:24:57,856 --> 01:25:03,446
Mom, I know this is the wrong time
to tell you, and I'm sorry.

1194
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:06,579
I just can't lie to you any
more.

1195
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:09,503
Boyd and I are divorced.

1196
01:25:09,824 --> 01:25:11,304
I know.

1197
01:25:12,784 --> 01:25:17,464
- Who told you?
- Nobody had to tell me.

1198
01:25:19,268 --> 01:25:21,662
Of course you knew.

1199
01:25:21,706 --> 01:25:24,706
What about you and Peter?

1200
01:25:26,798 --> 01:25:29,254
You know so much.
What about me and Peter?

1201
01:25:29,278 --> 01:25:33,630
Well, your father loved to
scheme.

1202
01:25:33,674 --> 01:25:38,089
Maybe he brought the two of you together.

1203
01:25:38,113 --> 01:25:43,529
Well, there's easier ways
of introducing people.

1204
01:25:43,553 --> 01:25:50,153
I still can't figure out why
he never told us about you.

1205
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:55,933
He said what he liked about
me was that he couldn't disappoint me.

1206
01:25:55,957 --> 01:25:58,631
Cos I never expected anything
from him.

1207
01:25:58,655 --> 01:26:01,571
He was bigger than life.

1208
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,159
Maybe that wasn't enough for
him.

1209
01:26:04,183 --> 01:26:06,465
That's what he was about.

1210
01:26:06,489 --> 01:26:08,796
Maybe it wasn't.

1211
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:13,760
Maybe that was
what he was gonna tell you.

1212
01:26:19,111 --> 01:26:21,437
OK, go on. Get out.

1213
01:26:21,461 --> 01:26:24,440
I'll go to the cemetery with
you.

1214
01:26:24,464 --> 01:26:28,064
I'm not going to the cemetery.

1215
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:30,687
Why not?

1216
01:26:31,732 --> 01:26:34,256
It's not my place.

1217
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:37,900
I said my goodbyes. I'm happy.

1218
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,708
Go on. Get outta here.

1219
01:26:44,223 --> 01:26:46,007
OK.

1220
01:27:07,376 --> 01:27:11,139
- You don't want this child.
- I didn't, but I do now.

1221
01:27:11,163 --> 01:27:16,923
- Why should I believe you?
- Because I love you.

1222
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:27,600
If he shot the sheriff but didn't
shoot the deputy, who did?

1223
01:28:03,563 --> 01:28:05,652
Thank you.

1224
01:28:12,485 --> 01:28:15,845
I'm the father of her child.

1225
01:28:50,175 --> 01:28:53,806
Tony, I didn't want to upset you.
I know you've got enough trouble.

1226
01:28:53,830 --> 01:28:56,287
- You know you lost an earring?- I know.

1227
01:28:56,311 --> 01:28:59,029
We're driving along.
This kid hops in and says,

1228
01:28:59,053 --> 01:29:04,600
"Hi. I'm Tom. I'm the father
of your daughter's child."

1229
01:29:04,624 --> 01:29:07,061
Just beautiful.

1230
01:29:13,981 --> 01:29:17,178
Your parents seem really nice.
I think they like me.

1231
01:29:17,202 --> 01:29:19,508
Oh, my God!

1232
01:29:19,552 --> 01:29:21,791
- Oh, my God!
- What?

1233
01:29:21,815 --> 01:29:24,272
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

1234
01:29:24,296 --> 01:29:27,864
Somebody help!

1235
01:29:27,908 --> 01:29:31,564
It's Rachel. Honey!

1236
01:29:33,392 --> 01:29:37,472
- It's Rachel.
- Come on, let's go.

1237
01:29:39,267 --> 01:29:40,810
I'm OK. I'm fine.

1238
01:29:40,834 --> 01:29:43,334
- She's having her baby.
- Good guess. Out of the way.

1239
01:29:43,358 --> 01:29:45,902
- I'm not due for two weeks.
- Tell your baby that.

1240
01:29:45,926 --> 01:29:48,035
- Give her room.
- I'm so embarrassed.

1241
01:29:48,059 --> 01:29:49,688
I'm the father of her child.

1242
01:29:49,712 --> 01:29:53,257
- Is there a doctor here?
- I birth babies all day long.

1243
01:29:53,281 --> 01:29:55,956
Someone go and call the
paramedics.

1244
01:29:55,980 --> 01:29:58,088
- I'll go.
- Relax, darling.

1245
01:29:58,112 --> 01:30:00,612
- I can't believe this.
- What do I do? Tell me.

1246
01:30:00,636 --> 01:30:02,658
First of all, shut up.

1247
01:30:02,682 --> 01:30:05,487
- OK. I can do that.- Stand
there and block the sun.

1248
01:30:05,511 --> 01:30:08,707
- Daddy. Daddy.
- I'm right here, honey.

1249
01:30:08,731 --> 01:30:11,275
I'm so sorry. I didn't
know this would happen.

1250
01:30:11,299 --> 01:30:15,323
No, no, no, no. I'm the one who's
sorry. I've been acting like a jerk.

1251
01:30:15,347 --> 01:30:18,108
- That's OK.
- No, it's not OK.

1252
01:30:18,132 --> 01:30:22,199
It's just that with Grandpa dying
and things at the union not working out

1253
01:30:22,223 --> 01:30:24,723
and you being pregnant, I...

1254
01:30:24,747 --> 01:30:27,726
I love you so much,
sweetheart. I've been thinking...

1255
01:30:27,750 --> 01:30:29,641
Can we talk about this later?

1256
01:30:29,665 --> 01:30:33,495
Oh, sure. Right. Later.

1257
01:30:33,539 --> 01:30:37,998
Everything's gonna be OK,
sweetie. Later.

1258
01:30:38,022 --> 01:30:41,286
What's so funny?

1259
01:30:41,329 --> 01:30:44,079
Will you look at that?

1260
01:30:47,466 --> 01:30:55,026
What other family would have
someone go into Labour at a burial?

1261
01:30:55,126 --> 01:30:57,060
- It's him.
- What?

1262
01:30:57,084 --> 01:31:00,084
Son of a bitch set me up.

1263
01:31:00,392 --> 01:31:04,154
The last thing I said to him was,
"I wanna climb a mountain."

1264
01:31:04,178 --> 01:31:07,810
"Shoot a lion. Catch a whale.
Anything."

1265
01:31:07,834 --> 01:31:09,986
- And what did he say?
- That.

1266
01:31:10,010 --> 01:31:12,447
Right down there.

1267
01:31:12,491 --> 01:31:17,298
That's what he was trying to
tell me those last couple of days.

1268
01:31:17,322 --> 01:31:22,433
If I can lead that bunch of lunatics,
I can do anything.

1269
01:31:22,457 --> 01:31:24,914
There's gonna be one more of us pretty soon.

1270
01:31:24,938 --> 01:31:29,018
What a family
that poor kid picked.

1271
01:31:35,427 --> 01:31:37,802
Why do you love me?

1272
01:31:38,560 --> 01:31:43,840
Because you always
end up in the right place.

1273
01:31:45,001 --> 01:31:50,281
You always make getting there
so interesting.

1274
01:31:50,485 --> 01:31:53,140
Thank you.

1275
01:31:53,184 --> 01:31:56,970
Johnny, get down here!

1276
01:31:57,013 --> 01:31:59,973
Johnny! Johnny!

1277
01:32:00,016 --> 01:32:01,690
I think they need you.

1278
01:32:01,714 --> 01:32:04,432
I think they need both of us.
Come on.

1279
01:32:04,456 --> 01:32:06,825
- Here he is.
- Let's get some water here.

1280
01:32:06,849 --> 01:32:09,959
- Back off, everybody.
- Oh, there you are.

1281
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,310
That means you too, Maureen.
Back off. Come on.

1282
01:32:13,334 --> 01:32:17,140
Johnny, don't let Nora
deliver this baby all by herself.

1283
01:32:17,164 --> 01:32:20,056
- Did you call an ambulance?
- I did. They're coming.

1284
01:32:20,080 --> 01:32:23,103
Good job. Has anybody
got a blanket in the car?

1285
01:32:23,127 --> 01:32:25,192
- I got jumper cables.
- Oh, thank you.

1286
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,845
- I got one in mine.
- Thanks.

1287
01:32:26,869 --> 01:32:29,674
Uncle Johnny,
I think my dad's gonna faint.

1288
01:32:29,698 --> 01:32:32,808
Don't worry,
somebody'll catch him. How are you?

1289
01:32:32,832 --> 01:32:35,400
I'm so scared.

1290
01:32:35,443 --> 01:32:38,030
- Don't worry.
- Is everything gonna be all right?

1291
01:32:38,054 --> 01:32:40,729
- It's gonna be fine.
- Will you stay here with me?

1292
01:32:40,753 --> 01:32:43,123
- I'm not going anywhere.
- You promise?

1293
01:32:43,147 --> 01:32:44,647
I promise.

1294
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:49,738
- Who are you?
- I'm the father of the child.

1295
01:32:49,762 --> 01:32:56,842
Take her hand and don't let go
no matter what she calls you.

1296
01:36:13,885 --> 01:36:16,290
