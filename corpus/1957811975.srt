1
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,611
Yes. Wonderful!

2
00:01:41,945 --> 00:01:43,154
Burning, baby!

3
00:01:43,238 --> 00:01:45,741
You want the car?
Do you want the car?

4
00:01:45,824 --> 00:01:50,538
Take the goddamn car.
Just a deal, isn't it, baby?

5
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:54,167
Take all the money!
Take it all, I don't need it.

6
00:01:54,251 --> 00:01:57,421
Just fucked my life over, baby.

7
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,508
What are you doing here? Get back.

8
00:02:03,303 --> 00:02:05,347
Get back, son-of-a-bitches!

9
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,852
Go away. Stay away! Shit!

10
00:02:12,188 --> 00:02:16,276
Oh yeah. You're screwed
from the moment you start.

11
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:19,989
Don't believe anything
they ever tell you.

12
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:21,824
It's all shit!

13
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:41,680
No, shit. You saw him jump
into a burning car?

14
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:44,308
Yeah. And it was like...
after a couple of minutes, man...

15
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:46,519
I could hear him frying.

16
00:02:47,228 --> 00:02:52,526
I can still smell him. Kinda like...
burning bacon mixed with rubber.

17
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:55,029
He didn't understand money.
Like you, Jack.

18
00:02:55,113 --> 00:02:56,948
Maybe he was trying to
tell you something.

19
00:02:57,032 --> 00:02:59,826
Come on, don't start with that.
You know it's a good deal.

20
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:03,456
Yeah. Good deal. I can also
flush my money down the toilet.

21
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:05,959
But I think about it,
like I told you.

22
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:08,879
A banker friend of mine...

23
00:03:09,629 --> 00:03:11,924
once took me inside a vault.

24
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:15,845
It was stacked with
a couple of million in cash.

25
00:03:15,928 --> 00:03:21,059
And the... whole room had this
strange but familiar odor to it.

26
00:03:21,143 --> 00:03:23,312
So, I started sniffing the money.

27
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:28,610
It was a mixture of a salty smell,
with a little bit of ammonia.

28
00:03:28,693 --> 00:03:32,072
And I started getting a hard-on.

29
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,242
And then, I realized
what it smelled like.

30
00:03:35,326 --> 00:03:39,622
It was pussy. I swear, Jack.
Go ahead, take a whiff.

31
00:03:40,248 --> 00:03:41,833
Go on, smell it.

32
00:03:45,337 --> 00:03:47,882
Marvin, I don't know who you've
been sleeping with, man, but that...

33
00:03:47,965 --> 00:03:50,635
that money sure don't smell like
any pussy I've ever smelled.

34
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:55,182
Hey, Jack. It smells like pussy.
That's why a man can't do without it.

35
00:03:55,266 --> 00:03:56,559
Leads him by the nose?

36
00:03:56,642 --> 00:04:00,188
And it's no coincidence that all of
our U.S. Treasurers are named...

37
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:01,898
Mary Ellen and Catalina.

38
00:04:01,982 --> 00:04:04,568
Come on, think about it.
They research this stuff.

39
00:04:04,651 --> 00:04:06,612
Wait a minute. Are you
telling me that the...

40
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:10,617
that the U.S. Mint adds the scent
of pussy to all printed money?

41
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,952
Is that what you're telling me?

42
00:04:12,035 --> 00:04:15,164
Why is it they love dollars
all over the world?

43
00:04:15,247 --> 00:04:18,960
Everybody loves dollars. Not just
likes and uses, but loves.

44
00:04:19,043 --> 00:04:22,380
Why is that, Jack?
For Christ's sake, wake up.

45
00:04:22,547 --> 00:04:25,592
You've got to understand money
before I decide to invest.

46
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:28,137
Because if I believe you
really understand money...

47
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,224
then I might be inclined
to trust you with mine.

48
00:04:34,603 --> 00:04:36,855
Sometimes, you know, I just
give her a piece of bologna...

49
00:04:36,939 --> 00:04:39,191
and put some mayonnaise
on it and just...

50
00:04:39,483 --> 00:04:41,152
let her whack me off.

51
00:04:42,195 --> 00:04:44,614
You know, you've got some
sick habits, dude.

52
00:04:45,574 --> 00:04:46,909
What's sick?

53
00:04:47,618 --> 00:04:50,454
Hey, man, you gotta take it
where you can get it.

54
00:04:50,538 --> 00:04:51,706
Yeah, I can see you
out there in the jungle...

55
00:04:51,789 --> 00:04:54,125
fucking gas tanks,
gopher holes, flashlights.

56
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,919
Why don't you tell me something?
What else do you fuck?

57
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:59,548
Man, you don't understand nothing.
Sometimes, people just gotta do it.

58
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:03,553
Like my Uncle Arto. We used to
work at a slaughterhouse.

59
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,847
They had all kinds of animals.

60
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,310
Sometimes, Arto or somebody else
would get real horny, you know...

61
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,187
so they couldn't take it anymore.

62
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,273
You know, a man has his needs.

63
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:14,816
So, they'd do one of the ducks.

64
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:17,945
They'd take it up
to the loft... you know.

65
00:05:18,362 --> 00:05:19,822
Know what?

66
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:21,991
They did it with the duck.
He'd fuck a duck

67
00:05:22,074 --> 00:05:23,368
I saw him.

68
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:25,245
And when he was done...

69
00:05:25,662 --> 00:05:27,414
he'd just twist his neck.

70
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:30,501
So, your uncle fucked a duck
and then he killed it?

71
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,588
It's tough on the duck.

72
00:05:33,713 --> 00:05:36,257
A man can't fuck a duck
and let it live.

73
00:05:36,341 --> 00:05:38,385
Well, you do a lot of damage.

74
00:05:38,468 --> 00:05:42,014
I mean, you have to turn his head,
so he doesn't face you.

75
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:44,434
Doggy style with a duck.

76
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:47,729
Let me ask you something,
what do ducks have?

77
00:05:47,812 --> 00:05:50,691
Do they have a vagina or... what?

78
00:05:50,774 --> 00:05:53,986
Hey, I don't know. I just watched.

79
00:05:55,363 --> 00:05:57,198
I don't need no duck.

80
00:05:58,825 --> 00:06:02,746
You're a duck fucker.
No more erotic duck fucking.

81
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:19,182
Wait!

82
00:06:21,768 --> 00:06:25,106
- I'm so sorry!
- That's okay.

83
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:27,567
- Oh my God, I am so sorry.
- It's perfectly okay.

84
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,069
- Are you alright?
- I'm okay.

85
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:31,905
- I didn't see you. I'm so sorry.
- Are you alright?

86
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,908
Oh yeah. A hundred percent. I just...

87
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:36,410
deduct two minutes off
the course and I'll be fine.

88
00:06:36,494 --> 00:06:39,998
Oh God. I can't believe
how clumsy I am.

89
00:06:40,582 --> 00:06:42,125
Do you rollerblade?

90
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:44,253
No, I just...

91
00:06:44,336 --> 00:06:47,215
I seem to
just jog and that's... plenty.

92
00:06:47,465 --> 00:06:50,552
You should try it some time.
It's a great workout.

93
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:54,306
I think I'm probably a little
too old for that now.

94
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,351
You don't seem that old to me.

95
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,270
You're in great shape.

96
00:07:00,605 --> 00:07:02,149
And you're kinda cute.

97
00:07:02,232 --> 00:07:04,735
Get outta here! Well...

98
00:07:04,818 --> 00:07:07,571
Well, you know, you should try it
some time. It's fun.

99
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,744
Excuse me. Are you...
from around here?

100
00:07:12,994 --> 00:07:14,204
- Yeah.
- You are?

101
00:07:14,288 --> 00:07:15,873
- Yeah.
- Do you drink coffee...

102
00:07:15,956 --> 00:07:16,999
from time to time?

103
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:18,334
- Yes, I do.
- You know, some athletes...

104
00:07:18,417 --> 00:07:21,087
Okay, now, he's...

105
00:07:21,337 --> 00:07:23,048
asking her to meet him...

106
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:25,551
and he definitely wants a date.

107
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:29,430
Fucking bastard! I can't believe
I was gonna marry this jerk.

108
00:07:29,806 --> 00:07:31,891
It's better to find out now.

109
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,519
I mean, it's one simple test.

110
00:07:34,603 --> 00:07:37,314
You know, it's one chance
to prove that he...

111
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,650
and he's all over you.

112
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:43,571
I can't believe I was that stupid.

113
00:07:43,655 --> 00:07:46,992
Well, you did come to us,
so you must have had a suspicion?

114
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:50,496
No, not really.

115
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,668
I was more curious, you know.
I was hoping he would pass.

116
00:07:55,752 --> 00:07:57,588
I asked him if he was married
and he told me...

117
00:07:57,671 --> 00:07:59,757
he was between relationships.

118
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:03,678
Let me ask you something.
Are they all like this?

119
00:08:03,761 --> 00:08:06,473
Yeah. About seventy-five
percent of the time.

120
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,643
Oh, boy.

121
00:08:10,603 --> 00:08:13,147
Laura, I think the best thing
you can do is just move on.

122
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:15,650
You know, don't... harp on this.

123
00:08:15,734 --> 00:08:19,154
But don't you feel he should
suffer some for what he's done?

124
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,031
Tim, how much would you charge...

125
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:23,868
to have him suffer a little
for what he's done?

126
00:08:24,077 --> 00:08:26,246
Just give me a round estimate.

127
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:28,081
Off the record?

128
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,542
We can help you out.

129
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:44,642
Well...

130
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,647
see, I figure you gotta
have your values.

131
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,108
You gotta... stick by them,
no matter what.

132
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:56,114
I mean... take your people...
down in Belize, for instance, right?

133
00:08:56,197 --> 00:08:57,949
They'd cut out someone's heart
and they'd run up...

134
00:08:58,033 --> 00:08:59,785
to the top of the temple steps.

135
00:08:59,868 --> 00:09:01,996
Now, if that heart stopped beating...

136
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:03,539
by the time they got up there,
they'd just run down...

137
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:05,374
and they'd get another one.
Now, that's fucking weird, right?

138
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:08,253
But it worked for them.
You see what I'm saying?

139
00:09:08,712 --> 00:09:10,422
What I'm saying is that
you gotta have values...

140
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:11,673
and you gotta stick
by them, no matter what.

141
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:13,759
You stay true to yourself
and everything flows your way.

142
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,845
- You become a servant of the...
- Servant?

143
00:09:15,928 --> 00:09:18,306
Why you want to become
a servant, Bobby Ray?

144
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,767
Not a servant... like
a servant servant, duck-brain.

145
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,895
What I'm talking about here
is you become a...

146
00:09:22,978 --> 00:09:25,022
a servant of fate, Leon.

147
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:28,026
See, I figure that conscience...

148
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,862
only produces people afraid
of getting caught, right?

149
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:32,614
So, if you shed that, you shed fear.

150
00:09:32,698 --> 00:09:35,451
And if you shed fear,
you're free, you understand?

151
00:09:35,534 --> 00:09:37,495
You're free to act out
your fullest potential.

152
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,038
Do you know what I'm saying?

153
00:09:39,664 --> 00:09:42,876
Fuck. I just need some money.

154
00:09:43,627 --> 00:09:44,962
You smell that?

155
00:09:45,045 --> 00:09:48,591
- Shit, man, that stinks, man.
- There's money in the bank.

156
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,772
Park Service!

157
00:10:08,322 --> 00:10:10,867
I don't want to sublet to my funeral.

158
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:12,285
What the fuck you talking about?

159
00:10:12,369 --> 00:10:14,872
Get the fuck up and
speak American, okay?

160
00:10:15,956 --> 00:10:17,082
Honey.

161
00:10:18,542 --> 00:10:19,710
Answer.

162
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:23,131
- Calm down.
- I'm a good girl.

163
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:27,136
- And I'll bet you are.
- I have a student visa.

164
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:30,098
Honey, I'm not with Immigration.

165
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,729
- Fuck you!
- Got a live one.

166
00:10:39,734 --> 00:10:41,319
Pull over right here.

167
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:54,376
No, Jack... come on.

168
00:10:54,584 --> 00:10:56,336
We're just taking a look.

169
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,464
I just want to show you some history.

170
00:10:58,547 --> 00:11:00,466
See that apartment building?

171
00:11:00,841 --> 00:11:04,471
I built that back in 1957.
First of its kind.

172
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:07,683
I sunk every cent I owned into it.

173
00:11:08,517 --> 00:11:11,145
Yeah, I had this idea...

174
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:14,566
instead of building boxes
for people to live in...

175
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,444
with the stairway
going up on the outside...

176
00:11:17,694 --> 00:11:21,699
that I would build it with
the apartments facing one another...

177
00:11:21,907 --> 00:11:24,828
with a tropical courtyard in between.

178
00:11:24,911 --> 00:11:26,454
Sort of a mini-neighborhood,
you know...

179
00:11:26,538 --> 00:11:31,418
where people could socialize
and get to know one another.

180
00:11:32,086 --> 00:11:34,422
Had a lot of ideas of what
to call it, but then...

181
00:11:34,505 --> 00:11:39,553
some reporter came up with
Garden Apartments and the name stuck.

182
00:11:39,636 --> 00:11:41,138
That's how you made all your money?

183
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:45,685
Yep, that was the start.
We had a vision.

184
00:11:46,144 --> 00:11:48,438
L.A. could have been paradise.

185
00:11:49,898 --> 00:11:53,736
Now, I'd like to level
the entire L.A. basin.

186
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,615
Turn it into the world's
biggest parking lot.

187
00:12:04,332 --> 00:12:07,043
Jack, have you ever had
an area fifty-one?

188
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:09,421
What the fuck is an area fifty-one?

189
00:12:09,504 --> 00:12:11,006
It's a secret, but everybody knows...

190
00:12:11,131 --> 00:12:13,926
- about it. Yeah.
- Shit. Is this about her?

191
00:12:14,009 --> 00:12:17,055
Christ, you know, I really hate
when people get too personal.

192
00:12:17,138 --> 00:12:19,224
What makes you say a dumb
fucking thing like that?

193
00:12:19,349 --> 00:12:21,351
Because it's always bad news.

194
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:23,938
You know, like some horrible thing
happened in their life and...

195
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:26,566
I gotta listen to it. You know?

196
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:29,069
It's natural. There's always
a woman who's gonna...

197
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:31,154
fuck up your life real good.

198
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:36,828
You see that building over there?
That's the old Ambassador Hotel.

199
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,164
Big party place in
the fifties and sixties.

200
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,792
That's where Bobby Kennedy got shot.

201
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,461
And I was in the kitchen
once where he got shot.

202
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:46,923
In the spot where he fell,
all the tiles have been...

203
00:12:47,006 --> 00:12:49,300
picked up for souvenirs.

204
00:12:49,384 --> 00:12:50,969
That's where we met.

205
00:12:51,261 --> 00:12:52,637
In the kitchen?

206
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:55,015
No. In the hotel.

207
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:58,436
Yeah.

208
00:12:58,936 --> 00:13:00,063
Yeah.

209
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,731
What's going on, Emma?

210
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:04,109
Same guy?

211
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:07,989
Alright, well, thanks for
getting her out of detox.

212
00:13:08,197 --> 00:13:09,574
Is she there?

213
00:13:11,242 --> 00:13:15,581
Alright, I'll do something.
Right. Yeah, I know. Bye.

214
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,209
Bad news?

215
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:21,546
Jack, have you got balls?
I mean, I don't do business...

216
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,256
with a guy who doesn't have balls.

217
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,133
What? Now, you're asking me to unzip?

218
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:28,471
Don't be a wise-ass. Just head
for the Hollywood freeway.

219
00:13:30,974 --> 00:13:37,064
Isn't it amazing how it seems
like everything is... chemical?

220
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:38,190
I mean...

221
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:44,865
I once read that love
is a chemical thing.

222
00:13:44,948 --> 00:13:46,074
That...

223
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,078
the chemical creates the obsession...

224
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:52,874
that makes us fall in love. And then,
like two or three years later...

225
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,337
our bodies change chemically
and we just fall out of love.

226
00:13:57,838 --> 00:14:01,300
I mean, as a chemist,
what do you think about that?

227
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:08,434
You're not my boyfriend.

228
00:14:13,064 --> 00:14:14,524
Leon!

229
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,778
Leon, you wanna make her
your little duck?

230
00:14:17,861 --> 00:14:19,029
Sure.

231
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,365
You gotta take it
where you can get it.

232
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:24,077
Now, what do you think about that?

233
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,829
Would you like to be
Leon's little duck?

234
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:27,998
Would you like to come
and cook for us?

235
00:14:30,292 --> 00:14:32,503
You could... think of it
as an internship...

236
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:35,507
and you could teach Leon
there how to cook.

237
00:14:36,091 --> 00:14:38,301
You ever seen a dolphin's dick?

238
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,928
Huge!

239
00:14:40,637 --> 00:14:42,723
I saw one once at Sea World.

240
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:45,894
I'm not no duck!

241
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,730
I'm not no duck!

242
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:53,694
Let's get this show on the road!

243
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:16,095
- Hi.
- Hi. How are you?

244
00:15:16,179 --> 00:15:17,597
Good, how are you?

245
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,016
Better now. Did you have
any trouble finding this place?

246
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,437
- Nope. None at all.
- Well, you look just delicious.

247
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,440
- Well, thank you.
- Oh my. My!

248
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:03,442
It looks like she's alone.

249
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:09,198
But just in case she shows up
or she's got some low-life guests.

250
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,576
Ain't this a bit extreme?

251
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,662
You know how to use it, don't you?

252
00:16:32,308 --> 00:16:33,602
Natalie?

253
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,371
Hey, Marvin.

254
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:28,123
Over here.

255
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:50,023
I thought I was dying.

256
00:17:51,692 --> 00:17:55,780
My heart... my heart's been
beating like a hummingbird.

257
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,576
I feel the earth spin.

258
00:18:04,457 --> 00:18:07,126
Looks like you're trying
real hard to die.

259
00:18:08,169 --> 00:18:10,088
Don't be a shit.

260
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,135
Take me up to bed.

261
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,221
No!

262
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:20,016
Mar!

263
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,269
Jack, do me a favor.

264
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:24,814
Pick her up, take her to the car.

265
00:18:29,319 --> 00:18:31,154
Take me inside.

266
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,245
- I think I'm gonna puke.
- Nah, don't do that.

267
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,631
Did you see my rooster?
His name is Zeus.

268
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,801
He thinks that he's an eagle.

269
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:57,101
And he eats tuna fish
and he drinks Jack Daniels.

270
00:18:57,393 --> 00:18:59,646
He's my baby.

271
00:19:38,482 --> 00:19:40,318
A race car driver.

272
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:47,576
Okay.

273
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:24,827
Nat!

274
00:20:31,418 --> 00:20:33,170
Pussycat!

275
00:20:49,398 --> 00:20:53,194
You are so... doggone beautiful.

276
00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:00,285
No, I... I'm not actually
into... that kind of thing.

277
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:02,288
It's just not my style. No big deal.

278
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:06,417
Just relax, Joe. It's
a game I always play.

279
00:21:06,876 --> 00:21:10,255
And if you wanna play with me,
you have to play the game.

280
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:13,300
Well, what... kind of... game?

281
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:16,512
Well, I like to be in control.

282
00:21:16,596 --> 00:21:18,681
I like it when a man
is totally helpless.

283
00:21:18,765 --> 00:21:21,101
- Yeah?
- And I can do anything...

284
00:21:21,184 --> 00:21:23,103
and all things to him.

285
00:21:23,854 --> 00:21:26,190
You do want to be my slave,
don't you, Joe?

286
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:27,650
I think so.

287
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:29,903
Aren't you getting a little excited
just thinking about...

288
00:21:29,986 --> 00:21:31,905
- what might happen?
- Yeah, I am.

289
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:33,991
This is never simple, is it?

290
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:35,993
The way I like to have fun.

291
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:37,745
- Next time...
- Yeah?

292
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:41,875
- It's your turn. I'll be the slave.
- Yeah.

293
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:43,418
Dominance...

294
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,546
- and submission.
- I know what you're talking about.

295
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:47,632
- Don't you ever think about it?
- Right now, I am.

296
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,593
It makes everything more intense.

297
00:21:55,641 --> 00:21:59,020
Sign me the fuck up! Come on, baby.

298
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:02,816
Let's get on board.
Go ahead. One time.

299
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:04,109
Yes!

300
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:06,862
Now, I know what
you're talking about.

301
00:22:06,946 --> 00:22:08,030
I thought you were kidding before...

302
00:22:08,114 --> 00:22:09,866
but you're the real thing,
aren't you?

303
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,243
You know what I like.

304
00:22:12,953 --> 00:22:14,413
You a mind reader?

305
00:22:14,496 --> 00:22:17,833
You saw it from go, didn't you?
You saw it from go.

306
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:21,629
You said, "Joe, I know you like
to get chained up a little bit."

307
00:22:21,713 --> 00:22:25,175
Well, I do. I always have.
Never been, but I always have.

308
00:22:27,595 --> 00:22:29,055
Put it on tight.

309
00:22:29,138 --> 00:22:31,015
You don't want me escaping, do you?

310
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,310
Cause if I escape,
I'm gonna beat your ass.

311
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,895
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

312
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:38,023
I'm gonna beat your ass!
Put it on tight.

313
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:39,775
- Yeah, you know what I'm saying.
- You're a woozy.

314
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,819
My little petite chu-chu.

315
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:45,490
Is that what you are? Are you
my little puppy spank dog?

316
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:48,035
Yeah, grab it.

317
00:22:48,202 --> 00:22:50,872
It's your world, baby. I'm just
a squirrel looking for a nut.

318
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:52,498
You know what I'm
trying to say to you?

319
00:22:52,582 --> 00:22:55,710
You window shopping?
Do you like what you see?

320
00:22:55,794 --> 00:22:58,589
Get a little cooking oil
and put it on my power source.

321
00:22:58,672 --> 00:22:59,757
You know what we could do?
We could...

322
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,218
get a little wax
and put it on my nipples.

323
00:23:03,803 --> 00:23:05,138
What are you doing?

324
00:23:05,305 --> 00:23:09,059
Amanda, what are you doing?

325
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:12,480
You're my favorite muffin
in the history of the world.

326
00:23:14,107 --> 00:23:15,233
Wha...

327
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,778
Oh, shit!

328
00:23:18,654 --> 00:23:20,739
Amanda, are you gonna rip me off?

329
00:23:20,823 --> 00:23:23,326
Is that what this whole thing
is about? With thi...

330
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:26,121
Is that what this is about?

331
00:23:26,746 --> 00:23:29,041
I mean, why are you getting
dressed? That's... crazy.

332
00:23:29,124 --> 00:23:31,252
Have you seen me lately?
It's all good.

333
00:23:31,335 --> 00:23:33,504
I mean, where could you
possibly be going?

334
00:23:33,588 --> 00:23:35,214
Amanda, would you please
just talk to me?

335
00:23:35,298 --> 00:23:38,593
Come on. I'm your guy.
Just talk to your guy.

336
00:23:40,804 --> 00:23:42,723
Stop the bombing.

337
00:23:43,182 --> 00:23:45,685
Baby, this is all part
of the game, isn't it?

338
00:23:46,436 --> 00:23:47,812
You're a freak.

339
00:23:48,104 --> 00:23:49,898
You're my little freak, aren't you?

340
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:53,486
This is the part where I watch you
and tell you how much I want you...

341
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:57,699
and you torment me until I'm just
completely and utterly psyched out.

342
00:23:57,782 --> 00:24:02,162
I want you, baby. I do.

343
00:24:02,246 --> 00:24:04,582
I want you to come over
here and touch it.

344
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,584
I want you to rub it
around a little bit.

345
00:24:06,668 --> 00:24:11,006
I want you to do, quite frankly,
whatever you want to do to it.

346
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:15,595
Listen, I'm begging you.
I want you to dominate my ass.

347
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:17,138
Baby...

348
00:24:17,639 --> 00:24:20,141
- you're pathetic.
- I know!

349
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,644
- I'll be seeing you.
- Oh God!

350
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:25,106
You destroy me, you're so fine.

351
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:29,194
You're so fine, you blow
my mind, Amanda!

352
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:32,281
Amanda?

353
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,410
So, how badly was the building
damaged in the quake?

354
00:24:36,494 --> 00:24:39,414
Bad enough. Joe and I picked it up
from the Japanese...

355
00:24:39,497 --> 00:24:41,374
at twenty cents on the dollar.

356
00:24:41,458 --> 00:24:43,919
We'll keep her in
one of the model units.

357
00:24:57,184 --> 00:24:59,896
Stash her in there.
Let her sleep it off.

358
00:25:03,525 --> 00:25:05,527
Son-of-a-bitch.

359
00:25:06,862 --> 00:25:09,824
Okay. Here we go...

360
00:25:12,661 --> 00:25:14,913
- Bad.
- There you go.

361
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,734
This is nice.

362
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:42,612
Pour yourself a drink.

363
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:49,119
How ya doing?

364
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:50,913
I'm beat.

365
00:25:51,789 --> 00:25:53,875
She knocks the hell out of me.

366
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:59,632
She pisses me off and breaks
my heart at the same time.

367
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:06,765
Natalie was such a...
pretty, talented kid.

368
00:26:08,809 --> 00:26:12,188
She could have done anything.
Had everything.

369
00:26:13,523 --> 00:26:15,316
She's always strung out.

370
00:26:17,486 --> 00:26:19,154
Just like her mother.

371
00:26:21,782 --> 00:26:24,953
I think women aren't the adults
they pretend to be.

372
00:26:25,036 --> 00:26:27,080
They live in their imagination.

373
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:30,584
They're like kids. They make up
the world in their own heads.

374
00:26:30,668 --> 00:26:33,504
That's why you never know
what the hell they're gonna do.

375
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:36,049
Yeah, but that's what makes 'em
interesting, right?

376
00:26:36,132 --> 00:26:37,592
Bullshit!

377
00:26:37,801 --> 00:26:40,387
It's what makes them untrustworthy.

378
00:26:41,472 --> 00:26:43,557
Yeah. Like you, Jack.

379
00:26:43,641 --> 00:26:47,729
You've been doing jobs for me
a long time, but can I trust you?

380
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:49,856
What the fuck are you talking about?

381
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:52,026
Can I, Jack? Can I trust you?

382
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,865
Don't!

383
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,624
These... can you put away
the garbage and clean up?

384
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,337
I don't do garbage.

385
00:27:18,765 --> 00:27:20,767
So, how are the lovebirds doing?

386
00:27:22,185 --> 00:27:23,604
Well, that's good.

387
00:27:29,736 --> 00:27:32,322
You sure do got small feet
there, Dot. Is that a...

388
00:27:32,406 --> 00:27:35,951
- Is that an Oriental thing?
- I don't know.

389
00:27:37,495 --> 00:27:39,455
My feet are okay.

390
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,958
Who wants big feet?

391
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:45,546
Farmer have big feet.
Not people from the city.

392
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,258
I have big feet.

393
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:51,303
Size thirteen.

394
00:27:51,928 --> 00:27:55,557
Hey, a man needs big feet
to conduct real business.

395
00:27:55,683 --> 00:27:58,519
People with big feet... smell.

396
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,690
Don't!

397
00:28:02,232 --> 00:28:04,067
Touchy.

398
00:28:04,151 --> 00:28:05,652
I don't smell.

399
00:28:06,862 --> 00:28:10,450
- Bobby Ray, do I smell?
- Get your armpit out of here.

400
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:14,371
- I ain't no dog.
- Hey, smell is important.

401
00:28:14,454 --> 00:28:16,790
It's alright if people smell some.

402
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:19,836
It's not good to smell like nothing.

403
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:23,965
I gotta take a leak.

404
00:28:24,466 --> 00:28:28,179
Okay, Dot, dear. Come on
over here and have a seat.

405
00:28:28,637 --> 00:28:29,805
What?

406
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:32,433
- Come over here and sit down.
- No.

407
00:28:32,517 --> 00:28:36,522
- I'm gonna get you.
- Don't.

408
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:38,023
- Come on! Put it down.
- Don't.

409
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,359
- Set it down.
- What?

410
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:42,487
Everything's gonna be okay. Come on.

411
00:28:44,197 --> 00:28:45,323
I just want you to have
a little seat...

412
00:28:45,407 --> 00:28:46,742
- Don't...
- I wanna have a little talk.

413
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:50,746
No!

414
00:28:51,664 --> 00:28:53,291
Come on. Sit down.

415
00:28:53,833 --> 00:28:55,085
No!

416
00:28:58,922 --> 00:29:00,382
There you go!

417
00:29:00,466 --> 00:29:02,844
Fuck you!

418
00:29:04,554 --> 00:29:05,764
Yes!

419
00:29:12,438 --> 00:29:14,440
So pretty.

420
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:19,112
There we go.

421
00:29:22,491 --> 00:29:24,953
Why are you treating me like a dog?

422
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:28,498
Well, because you look like
you might bark at any time.

423
00:29:31,377 --> 00:29:32,753
Me and Leon...

424
00:29:33,087 --> 00:29:34,255
we got some business
to take care of...

425
00:29:34,338 --> 00:29:36,132
so we're gonna be
going out for a while.

426
00:29:36,216 --> 00:29:39,052
That means you're gonna
be alone, okay?

427
00:29:39,136 --> 00:29:41,055
Now, if I was you,
when I was cooking...

428
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:42,681
I'd make sure I get it right.

429
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:46,102
Cause if you don't, you're gonna
fry in this fucking place.

430
00:29:46,185 --> 00:29:47,979
Do you understand what I'm saying?

431
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,275
I'm not going to cook for you.

432
00:29:54,528 --> 00:29:56,281
You are cute.

433
00:30:01,537 --> 00:30:03,539
That was beautiful!

434
00:30:04,373 --> 00:30:06,960
I can't leave you two
alone for a minute!

435
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:10,046
I gonna go out and make
some calls. Natalie's gone.

436
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,381
Gone where?

437
00:30:12,382 --> 00:30:14,760
You know that dumb fuck in
the Lincoln that almost hit us?

438
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:16,345
- Yeah?
- I've never seen that car...

439
00:30:16,429 --> 00:30:18,348
here before. I think that's that
old man we've been talking about...

440
00:30:18,431 --> 00:30:21,685
so I'm... gonna go get
the ball rolling, okay?

441
00:30:36,243 --> 00:30:38,037
Alright, she's asleep.

442
00:30:39,372 --> 00:30:42,000
I want you to stay here
with her this afternoon, okay?

443
00:30:42,084 --> 00:30:45,170
Oh, man, I don't know. I mean,
what if she gets sick, you know?

444
00:30:45,462 --> 00:30:47,882
You know, I don't got
my car. I mean...

445
00:30:48,674 --> 00:30:50,468
maybe we should take her to a clinic.

446
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:52,888
No. She'll just freak out.

447
00:30:52,971 --> 00:30:57,476
There's no phone here, so...
here's my cellphone if you need me.

448
00:30:57,727 --> 00:30:59,395
I'll come back later.

449
00:31:00,063 --> 00:31:01,231
Hey!

450
00:31:02,566 --> 00:31:03,984
You want this?

451
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:07,822
No. You keep it... for now.

452
00:31:09,157 --> 00:31:12,160
Come on, Amanda, bring it
back in here, baby.

453
00:31:12,243 --> 00:31:16,039
Bring it back in here and
put it right on my nose.

454
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,966
Hiya, Joe.

455
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,138
Gee, what a strange place
to meet you.

456
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:32,183
You remember me, don't you?

457
00:31:34,394 --> 00:31:37,481
The woman you're supposed
to marry in four weeks.

458
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:40,484
The woman you're supposed
to be faithful to.

459
00:31:41,444 --> 00:31:43,530
The woman you love, remember?

460
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:45,365
Yeah, baby. I remember.

461
00:31:45,741 --> 00:31:48,160
I just... have to tell you one thing,
right off the bat here.

462
00:31:48,243 --> 00:31:51,205
This is not what it looks like.

463
00:31:51,497 --> 00:31:53,625
- What does it look like, Joe?
- I don't know...

464
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,669
but if you just help me out of
these cuffs, I can explain...

465
00:31:55,752 --> 00:31:58,547
- the entire thing to you.
- Well, I don't have the keys, Joe.

466
00:31:58,756 --> 00:32:01,509
Joe, I wonder who has the keys?

467
00:32:02,593 --> 00:32:05,889
You know what... here, let me look.

468
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:10,686
Let me just look for something
to help you out of this situation.

469
00:32:10,769 --> 00:32:13,064
Look what I found.

470
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:15,400
Look what I found, Joe.

471
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:16,860
I see what you've found,
but that sure as shit's...

472
00:32:16,943 --> 00:32:18,111
not gonna help us out
of these cuffs.

473
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:19,822
These are fucking steel,
they're not clay.

474
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,157
- This is real, baby.
- You know what I...

475
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,783
you know what I'm gonna do?

476
00:32:22,867 --> 00:32:25,453
I am gonna punish you
for what you've done to me...

477
00:32:25,537 --> 00:32:27,831
- What?
- you fucking pathetic bastard!

478
00:32:27,914 --> 00:32:31,085
You wanna know what I'm gonna do,
baby? I'm gonna cut it off.

479
00:32:31,168 --> 00:32:33,671
Get the fuck out of here!
You can't cut it off.

480
00:32:33,754 --> 00:32:35,131
There's no cutting it off!

481
00:32:35,214 --> 00:32:36,257
- Yes...
- No!

482
00:32:36,341 --> 00:32:39,678
- I can.
- Oh no! No! Laura, look!

483
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:42,973
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

484
00:32:43,057 --> 00:32:46,603
I gave you all my love and trust
and some girl comes along...

485
00:32:46,686 --> 00:32:49,189
and shows a little interest
in you and...

486
00:32:49,272 --> 00:32:51,984
- you're ready to give up everything?
- No!

487
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:56,072
You are a selfish bastard who doesn't
give a shit about anybody else!

488
00:32:56,155 --> 00:32:58,491
Baby, listen! Now, come on!

489
00:32:58,575 --> 00:33:00,953
Everything you're saying
is true. It is.

490
00:33:01,036 --> 00:33:03,664
I don't know why I did what
I did, but I'm so sorry...

491
00:33:03,747 --> 00:33:06,125
and I love you more than...
I love you more than my breath.

492
00:33:06,209 --> 00:33:07,919
I love you more than air, baby.

493
00:33:08,002 --> 00:33:11,632
You're a sorry excuse
for a human being!

494
00:33:12,132 --> 00:33:15,303
You never thought about how much
this was gonna hurt me...

495
00:33:15,386 --> 00:33:18,932
and you hurt me!
And now, it's your turn.

496
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:23,103
No. You can't!

497
00:33:23,187 --> 00:33:27,692
No, I'm sorry.

498
00:33:28,651 --> 00:33:32,823
You're not worth it.
You're not even worth it.

499
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:36,577
God, how I hate you.

500
00:33:36,911 --> 00:33:40,039
- I hate you!
- No, baby, come on.

501
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:46,088
Laura, baby, don't go.
Come on! Don't go. Come on...

502
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:49,175
why does everybody go around here?

503
00:33:49,258 --> 00:33:51,386
Laura, come on.

504
00:33:51,678 --> 00:33:54,681
You gotta help me with
these fucking cuffs.

505
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:56,684
Laura!

506
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:02,899
Amanda! Laura! You wacky
fucking bitches!

507
00:35:13,022 --> 00:35:15,483
This guy doesn't live like he's rich.

508
00:35:21,824 --> 00:35:23,117
Look at this.

509
00:35:23,451 --> 00:35:25,620
Beets, potatoes, bananas.

510
00:35:26,621 --> 00:35:28,957
There's not even a beer here.
There's no bread, no mayo.

511
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:31,377
This guy's a big shot
real estate developer...

512
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:32,878
lives like a truck driver.

513
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:34,839
Hey, I could cook us something.

514
00:35:34,922 --> 00:35:36,216
Yeah, like what?

515
00:35:36,299 --> 00:35:37,968
Tomato soup.

516
00:35:39,511 --> 00:35:40,888
Tomato soup?

517
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,267
Tomato soup is not a real food, okay?

518
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:46,269
I need some real food. Do you know
what I mean? Like steak and eggs.

519
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,645
Something to re-grease
my stomach with.

520
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:52,359
Yeah, I make it real good.
Some garlic, some chili pepper.

521
00:35:53,068 --> 00:35:54,362
See, chili...

522
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:57,657
now, there's a real food.
A little pork, a little beef.

523
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,618
Add a can of beer and...

524
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:02,871
And there's something
with some calories. Yeah.

525
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:05,625
Hey, maybe you oughta go out
and get us some chili!

526
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:08,086
No, maybe I shouldn't.

527
00:36:10,714 --> 00:36:12,883
I could add some milk.

528
00:36:13,717 --> 00:36:15,511
Oh yeah, that's a good idea.

529
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:17,013
Add some milk to your chili.

530
00:36:17,096 --> 00:36:21,226
What is that, some kind of
jungle food? Probably bugs too.

531
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,479
Yah, I don't eat bugs.

532
00:36:26,858 --> 00:36:29,736
Yeah, he probably fries 'em up
till they're nice and crunchy.

533
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,760
Amanda!

534
00:38:03,136 --> 00:38:05,263
I know you can hear me, baby!

535
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:08,308
You got cottage cheese thighs!

536
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:13,356
You got a double chin and
you got droopy fucking eyes.

537
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:15,734
Hey, Laura, you wanna know something?

538
00:38:16,151 --> 00:38:20,781
I'm currently sleeping with
your sister! Oh my God!

539
00:38:20,864 --> 00:38:23,075
And she's not a moaner like you.

540
00:38:23,159 --> 00:38:26,454
She a groaner... at least she...
Lisa goes like this...

541
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:33,254
Instead of your quiet ass in bed.

542
00:38:33,421 --> 00:38:36,090
"Joe, take it out of there
and put it in my ass."

543
00:38:36,174 --> 00:38:40,929
I would never fuck you in the ass!
I wouldn't do you the favor!

544
00:39:57,309 --> 00:39:58,769
That was nice.

545
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,105
So...

546
00:40:01,648 --> 00:40:03,692
you're my babysitter.

547
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:05,319
I guess.

548
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,488
Just for a little while.

549
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,823
Do you golf?

550
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,493
But I'm gonna learn.

551
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,162
That's where the money is.

552
00:40:17,917 --> 00:40:21,421
- So, what's your name?
- Jack. With a "J".

553
00:40:21,796 --> 00:40:24,090
Well, I'm Natalie, Jack.

554
00:40:25,133 --> 00:40:26,802
And you work for Mar?

555
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,804
I help him out.

556
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,976
And he's gonna do you a favor.

557
00:40:33,518 --> 00:40:36,897
Are you a little entrepreneur
without money?

558
00:40:37,105 --> 00:40:39,525
You got a nasty mouth, babe.

559
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:44,239
Don't take it personally.
See, I know Mar pretty well.

560
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:46,950
And the kind of people he attracts.

561
00:40:47,326 --> 00:40:48,744
Anyway...

562
00:40:49,036 --> 00:40:50,830
I don't give a shit.

563
00:40:50,913 --> 00:40:53,124
He's just trying to help you out.

564
00:40:53,416 --> 00:40:56,586
He's a liar. You'll find out.

565
00:40:57,713 --> 00:41:00,090
You never know what's real with him.

566
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:03,803
So...

567
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:06,932
if I wanna leave...

568
00:41:07,474 --> 00:41:09,393
are you gonna try to stop me?

569
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,313
Probably. Look,
why don't you just relax?

570
00:41:12,396 --> 00:41:14,858
Just kick back,
wait till he gets here.

571
00:41:14,941 --> 00:41:17,152
Then, you guys can
work this shit out?

572
00:41:17,611 --> 00:41:20,739
You don't look particularly
stupid. Are you?

573
00:41:22,032 --> 00:41:23,743
Oh, brother.

574
00:41:26,371 --> 00:41:30,542
Let me ask you something. It's...
been bugging me for a while.

575
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,379
You can call a man an asshole...

576
00:41:34,088 --> 00:41:36,216
but what if it's a woman?

577
00:41:36,382 --> 00:41:39,136
I mean, there's names like bitch
and cunt but, you know...

578
00:41:39,219 --> 00:41:41,138
that's not the right sentiment.

579
00:41:41,221 --> 00:41:44,392
They're the wrong flavor.
So, what is the right word?

580
00:41:44,475 --> 00:41:49,022
Like prince and princess,
actor, actress...

581
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:51,942
Is it asshole-ess?

582
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:05,875
Oh, man.

583
00:42:32,864 --> 00:42:35,993
- Can you help me, please?
- Hey! This is private property!

584
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:39,622
- How'd you get back here?
- Oh God! My foot!

585
00:42:41,541 --> 00:42:42,876
What's wrong?

586
00:42:43,335 --> 00:42:45,003
I'm lost.

587
00:42:45,421 --> 00:42:47,715
What'd you do to your foot?
Some dog chew on it?

588
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,218
I cut it and...

589
00:42:50,718 --> 00:42:52,095
it hurts.

590
00:42:53,722 --> 00:42:55,391
So dizzy.

591
00:42:55,641 --> 00:42:57,852
I thought you were a burglar.
I mean, I...

592
00:42:58,019 --> 00:42:59,103
I hate thieves.

593
00:42:59,187 --> 00:43:01,105
I hate 'em more than anything!

594
00:43:01,523 --> 00:43:04,151
Except maybe liars. Here...
what's going on?

595
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:08,656
I am not... I'm not
a thief, but I'm just...

596
00:43:09,031 --> 00:43:12,243
Jesus. You are really messed up.

597
00:43:12,327 --> 00:43:14,830
- I'm so tired.
- Are you here with anybody?

598
00:43:14,913 --> 00:43:16,415
Come on, don't go out on me. Come on.

599
00:43:16,498 --> 00:43:17,875
Hurts.

600
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:19,627
Alright. I'll bring you
inside. Come on.

601
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,796
It's okay. I'll take care of you.

602
00:43:22,672 --> 00:43:23,924
Alright.

603
00:43:24,216 --> 00:43:26,260
Here we go. It's okay.

604
00:43:26,343 --> 00:43:28,637
Come on. Stay with me.

605
00:43:30,139 --> 00:43:31,474
I got you.

606
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:37,773
- Hey, Leon.
- What?

607
00:43:38,190 --> 00:43:39,817
Come here and take a look at this.

608
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,363
Shit.

609
00:43:44,364 --> 00:43:46,158
Shit, somebody's here.

610
00:43:57,838 --> 00:44:01,300
Hey, Marvin. How's it hanging?

611
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,596
Has she got talent or what?

612
00:44:06,348 --> 00:44:10,269
What the fuck are you doing here?
Get your ass outta my house.

613
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:13,898
Well, actually, I'm watching
this show and it's not done yet.

614
00:44:13,981 --> 00:44:15,024
Hey, you want something to eat?

615
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:17,194
Cause Leon's in the kitchen
making some... tomato soup.

616
00:44:17,277 --> 00:44:19,988
Hey, Leon! You like
tomato soup, don't you?

617
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,166
Fuck off. What do you want?

618
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:32,127
Straight to the point.

619
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,589
You know who I am?

620
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,426
How the hell would I know who
you are? I never met you before.

621
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,929
You are a tricky old
bastard, aren't you?

622
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:42,890
Hey, you never did
answer my question.

623
00:44:42,973 --> 00:44:45,101
You think she's got talent or what?

624
00:44:47,228 --> 00:44:51,608
Yeah, she's... she was talented.
She had potential.

625
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:53,194
And her daughter?

626
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:55,905
Yeah. The same.

627
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,410
Well, that wasn't so hard, was it?

628
00:45:00,952 --> 00:45:04,498
Well, you know me and you know her,
so you know what I want, right?

629
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,461
Yeah, I know what you want.

630
00:45:08,795 --> 00:45:09,963
And I...

631
00:45:10,464 --> 00:45:13,634
And I want you to leave her alone.

632
00:45:15,177 --> 00:45:18,014
Well, you wanna tell me, when did you
get into the kidnapping racket?

633
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:19,140
Didn't kidnap her.

634
00:45:19,224 --> 00:45:20,684
- Well, where is she?
- Don't know.

635
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,311
- Don't know?
- No.

636
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,981
He don't know where she is.

637
00:45:26,065 --> 00:45:30,278
Well, if you don't know nothing,
I guess we should just leave?

638
00:45:30,362 --> 00:45:32,489
I guess we should just... but
are you sure that you don't know...

639
00:45:32,572 --> 00:45:35,075
cause me and Natalie, we...

640
00:45:35,826 --> 00:45:37,787
sorta had this thing going.

641
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:39,330
Can't help you.

642
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:57,852
You know that lying is the only
thing that separates the...

643
00:45:57,935 --> 00:46:00,772
animal from the people.
Did you know that?

644
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:03,567
It's the one thing that
they just cannot do.

645
00:46:03,650 --> 00:46:08,155
You see, that's what makes us humans.
That's what makes us people.

646
00:46:08,406 --> 00:46:09,574
You know

647
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:12,702
the Eskimos have twenty-two
ways for saying snow.

648
00:46:12,786 --> 00:46:15,205
I bet there are just as many
ways to tell a lie...

649
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:18,918
- I can't help you.
- I can't hear you! What's that?

650
00:46:19,001 --> 00:46:21,587
I can't help you. Can't help.

651
00:46:21,671 --> 00:46:22,756
You can't help me. You know what?

652
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:25,467
You're really starting to
fuckin' piss me off!

653
00:46:26,134 --> 00:46:27,469
Let's go.

654
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:30,848
Come on. You must be getting senile.

655
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:33,309
Must be all that shit food
you've been eating.

656
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:36,939
You still have a thing
for her mother...

657
00:46:37,022 --> 00:46:38,482
and now you think you're
gonna save her daughter.

658
00:46:38,565 --> 00:46:40,651
Kiss my ass!

659
00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:45,240
Spunk, you shut up, you... got spunk.

660
00:46:48,494 --> 00:46:51,998
- What in the hell smells?
- Shit, the soup is burning.

661
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:56,002
I got an idea. It's in the kitchen.

662
00:47:11,687 --> 00:47:12,730
Fuck.

663
00:47:34,839 --> 00:47:36,758
Son-of-a-bitch!

664
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:45,435
Last one.

665
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:47,520
Okay.

666
00:47:48,438 --> 00:47:50,023
That wasn't so bad.

667
00:48:09,629 --> 00:48:10,881
Okay.

668
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:23,187
You just sleep it off.

669
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,901
Help me!

670
00:48:29,319 --> 00:48:32,614
I am on the other side of this wall.

671
00:48:33,323 --> 00:48:34,950
Help!

672
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:36,911
Don't stop.

673
00:48:38,246 --> 00:48:39,706
What the fuck?

674
00:48:40,290 --> 00:48:42,959
I have been tricked!

675
00:48:44,253 --> 00:48:46,714
S... O... fucking S!

676
00:48:46,797 --> 00:48:48,549
Hey, don't move.

677
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:51,761
- I'll be right back.
- I'm on the other side of this wall!

678
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,638
Help me!

679
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,992
What the fuck is going on?

680
00:49:25,425 --> 00:49:28,554
Man, you're into some serious shit!

681
00:49:30,765 --> 00:49:32,684
Thank God you heard me!

682
00:49:32,767 --> 00:49:36,355
I'm so... glad to see you.

683
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:38,023
Do you think you could
help me out of this thing?

684
00:49:38,107 --> 00:49:39,942
It's very precarious for me.

685
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:41,652
Well, I don't know, man.

686
00:49:44,614 --> 00:49:46,950
You're a strong man. You should
be a real weightlifter.

687
00:49:47,034 --> 00:49:48,911
You're a strong...

688
00:49:48,994 --> 00:49:51,414
Yes!

689
00:49:51,497 --> 00:49:53,541
Why don't you just
come in and sit down?

690
00:49:58,547 --> 00:50:01,008
That fucking bitch!

691
00:50:02,468 --> 00:50:04,429
I mean, do you realize that
the worst ones are the ones...

692
00:50:04,512 --> 00:50:06,806
you think you'd really just die for?

693
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,475
And do you know why?

694
00:50:08,684 --> 00:50:10,352
- Why?
- Because you really think...

695
00:50:10,436 --> 00:50:12,021
you've got something.

696
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:15,900
And then, they start
messing with your head.

697
00:50:15,984 --> 00:50:17,736
And you know what the funny thing is?

698
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,530
You can spot 'em a mile away...

699
00:50:19,613 --> 00:50:22,867
because they all got that
one special physical feature.

700
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:26,788
They do. I don't care if it's the way
their hipbone protrudes or...

701
00:50:26,871 --> 00:50:29,416
the way their lip curls up
or something about her...

702
00:50:29,499 --> 00:50:31,877
delicious belly button
or her lips or ears...

703
00:50:31,961 --> 00:50:35,465
whatever it is, it sucks you in
and suddenly, you're doomed.

704
00:50:35,548 --> 00:50:40,429
And you start acting stupid so fast.
And that's when it begins.

705
00:50:40,512 --> 00:50:43,974
Everything you do is wrong.
Everything you know is wrong.

706
00:50:44,058 --> 00:50:46,019
If you even open up your mouth
to speak, she wants to start...

707
00:50:46,102 --> 00:50:49,147
a fucking war. A fucking war!

708
00:50:49,231 --> 00:50:52,401
Usually over trivia.
Really small, dumb shit.

709
00:50:52,484 --> 00:50:55,112
Like... leaving the cap
off the toothpaste.

710
00:50:55,196 --> 00:50:57,031
That's good for a forty-eight
hour war right there.

711
00:50:57,115 --> 00:51:00,994
And that's why people go postal.
Trust me, that's just exactly why.

712
00:51:01,078 --> 00:51:05,124
It's the little things in life.
They just push us too far.

713
00:51:05,207 --> 00:51:06,626
But I'm going to get her.

714
00:51:09,045 --> 00:51:12,591
I'm sorry, but I am going to get her.

715
00:51:13,801 --> 00:51:17,096
Major league! I mean, just who does
this cunt think that she is?

716
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,101
Coming into my life and dictating
the terms of it to me. Okay?

717
00:51:21,184 --> 00:51:25,189
Fucking do this! Fucking do that!

718
00:51:25,272 --> 00:51:26,816
Gotta be a complete wacko
for even thinking...

719
00:51:26,941 --> 00:51:28,484
she can pull off a stunt like that.

720
00:51:28,609 --> 00:51:30,779
Okay? So, fuck her!

721
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:32,406
Fuck her!

722
00:51:38,913 --> 00:51:40,540
Fucking pussy.

723
00:51:40,623 --> 00:51:42,584
Oh no.

724
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:44,503
- Jesus Christ!
- Just hold it, hold it.

725
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:45,671
Come on!

726
00:51:47,757 --> 00:51:48,841
Ready...

727
00:51:53,805 --> 00:51:55,390
It's only gonna get worse, Marvin!

728
00:51:55,474 --> 00:51:56,892
You're gonna end up
looking like tomato soup.

729
00:51:56,976 --> 00:51:58,352
Why don't you just
tell me where she is?

730
00:51:58,436 --> 00:52:00,980
- No.
- You got something to say?

731
00:52:02,941 --> 00:52:07,404
Jesus Christ! I'll make you a deal.

732
00:52:07,488 --> 00:52:09,615
- I'll pay you to leave her alone!
- So, I would say...

733
00:52:09,699 --> 00:52:11,826
about 200,000 dollars oughta
get you what you want.

734
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,161
How does that sound?

735
00:52:13,244 --> 00:52:15,539
You'll get out of the state, right?

736
00:52:15,622 --> 00:52:17,374
- I'm as good as gone.
- Okay.

737
00:52:17,458 --> 00:52:20,545
- I'm as good as fucking gone.
- I'll make the arrangements then.

738
00:52:20,628 --> 00:52:22,714
Okay. Take it easy.

739
00:52:25,175 --> 00:52:27,553
When a man sees a beautiful woman...

740
00:52:28,429 --> 00:52:30,139
a beautiful woman...

741
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,393
he reacts.

742
00:52:33,852 --> 00:52:36,104
He does something.

743
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:40,693
End of story.

744
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:44,406
I mean, what... did she expect?

745
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:47,618
I go for runs on my lunch break.

746
00:52:47,701 --> 00:52:50,454
I'm a certified fucking
public accountant.

747
00:52:50,538 --> 00:52:55,585
I crunch numbers all night and
all day! What did she expect?

748
00:52:56,294 --> 00:52:58,171
I'll tell you what she should expect!

749
00:52:58,255 --> 00:53:02,301
To fucking have her fucking thyroid
ripped out with my nuts!

750
00:53:02,885 --> 00:53:04,470
Nice friend.

751
00:53:05,805 --> 00:53:09,810
Next time, when we hear banging,
don't let me leave the room, okay?

752
00:53:10,853 --> 00:53:12,521
What next time?

753
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:23,951
Hello?

754
00:53:30,417 --> 00:53:32,211
Hello!

755
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:51,720
It's what I do for a living.

756
00:54:54,848 --> 00:54:55,933
Come on.

757
00:54:57,059 --> 00:54:58,311
Are you a chemist?

758
00:54:58,394 --> 00:54:59,937
Actually, I..

759
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,023
I prefer to...

760
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:05,068
I prefer to think of myself
as an alchemist.

761
00:55:06,612 --> 00:55:10,575
I read about that once. You change
ordinary metal into gold?

762
00:55:10,658 --> 00:55:12,786
Transmitting matter. Yeah.

763
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:14,996
I don't think that can be done.

764
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:17,249
Well, I can't make gold but...

765
00:55:17,708 --> 00:55:20,837
some things... better than gold.

766
00:55:21,963 --> 00:55:26,510
Well, I was a chemistry student
at Stanford. What are you making?

767
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:31,516
This is just venom. Later, I turn it
into antitoxin, antisera.

768
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:35,479
- No gold?
- No. No gold. Just anti-venom.

769
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:38,065
How do you make it?

770
00:55:38,148 --> 00:55:40,526
Well, I've got some horses.

771
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:44,114
When I inject them with the venom,
their immune system kicks in...

772
00:55:44,197 --> 00:55:45,657
and creates antibodies.

773
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:50,454
Later, I withdraw the blood
and I extract the antibodies.

774
00:55:50,538 --> 00:55:53,583
Does it, you know, harm the horses?

775
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:58,213
No. Not at all. As a matter
of fact, it pays the bills.

776
00:55:58,297 --> 00:55:59,798
Let me ask you something.

777
00:56:00,007 --> 00:56:03,219
Have you ever heard of
a place called Vilcabamba?

778
00:56:03,511 --> 00:56:06,598
- Vilcabamba?
- Yeah, it's a place in Ecuador...

779
00:56:06,681 --> 00:56:08,976
where people live to be
about a hundred and thirty...

780
00:56:09,059 --> 00:56:12,271
to a hundred and forty years.
It's sort of a valley...

781
00:56:12,355 --> 00:56:14,732
where five valleys converge
beneath the Reclining God.

782
00:56:14,816 --> 00:56:18,195
Anyway, people live
incredibly long lives there.

783
00:56:18,278 --> 00:56:19,905
It's sort of a...

784
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,074
a natural paradise.

785
00:56:22,158 --> 00:56:24,076
So, I went down there to go
do some research, right?

786
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,870
To check out the chemistry.
To see if this is true...

787
00:56:25,954 --> 00:56:27,330
see if it's even possible.

788
00:56:27,414 --> 00:56:30,793
The only thing I could find
was a Huilca tree...

789
00:56:30,876 --> 00:56:33,838
which puts out about
twenty-five percent more oxygen...

790
00:56:33,921 --> 00:56:36,299
than almost any other tree.
Doesn't that sound great?

791
00:56:36,382 --> 00:56:39,928
But another thing they had
was the San Pedro cactus.

792
00:56:40,012 --> 00:56:43,891
It's kind of like peyote,
only much stronger.

793
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:46,436
Do you get high?

794
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:49,523
You mean drug?

795
00:56:51,191 --> 00:56:52,693
Something like that.

796
00:56:52,818 --> 00:56:56,823
I make drug sometime for people,
but it's not a good drug.

797
00:56:56,906 --> 00:56:58,742
Really? What were you making?

798
00:56:58,825 --> 00:57:00,702
Methamphetamine.

799
00:57:01,662 --> 00:57:03,831
That's like synthetic bullshit.

800
00:57:03,914 --> 00:57:07,293
That's pretty unsophisticated
for a Stanford chemist.

801
00:57:08,586 --> 00:57:10,547
I didn't graduate yet.

802
00:57:11,298 --> 00:57:15,720
Well, the real stuff
is refined from nature.

803
00:57:15,803 --> 00:57:17,764
It's transmuted.

804
00:57:18,097 --> 00:57:19,682
Like... wine?

805
00:57:19,766 --> 00:57:24,104
Yes! Exactly! Like old wine
or aged scotch.

806
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:27,483
The thing is, it's gotta have
an edge. It's gotta go both ways.

807
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:29,569
And when you're there
and they collide...

808
00:57:29,652 --> 00:57:32,948
man, it's combining opposites.

809
00:57:33,031 --> 00:57:36,327
I think this is the secret
to eternal life.

810
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,455
Really?

811
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:41,958
Really.

812
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,379
Keep your eyes number...

813
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:50,468
Come to shoot me. That's what
I should have done.

814
00:57:50,552 --> 00:57:54,348
And I worried that... I'm looking
for you and looking...

815
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:55,891
Christ!

816
00:58:00,897 --> 00:58:02,983
Alright, son-of-a-bitch.

817
00:58:10,533 --> 00:58:11,993
Natalie!

818
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,621
Pussycat!

819
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:19,377
Come on. Honey,
honey bunny, I'm here!

820
00:58:21,337 --> 00:58:24,299
It's Bobby Ray. He can
get real ballistic.

821
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,765
- Natalie!
- Tell him you need some time alone.

822
00:58:30,848 --> 00:58:33,309
- Do it. Go on.
- Okay.

823
00:58:33,434 --> 00:58:36,480
Bobby Ray! I need some time to think!

824
00:58:36,563 --> 00:58:39,692
Come on! Open up the door!
I don't got any time to...

825
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:42,278
patience or anything! Come on.

826
00:58:45,532 --> 00:58:52,248
Natalie, open the door!

827
00:58:52,331 --> 00:58:55,919
- Natalie!
- Okay, stop pounding!

828
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:00,925
Shit.

829
00:59:01,008 --> 00:59:03,511
You better leave. He's got a gun!

830
00:59:03,594 --> 00:59:05,972
- He don't have no gun.
- Is that right?

831
00:59:09,142 --> 00:59:10,394
Fuck.

832
00:59:13,606 --> 00:59:16,317
What did I tell you, you moron?

833
00:59:20,239 --> 00:59:22,199
She's trying to kill you, man.

834
00:59:22,575 --> 00:59:24,368
Relationships.

835
00:59:24,786 --> 00:59:26,412
Let's get outta here, man.

836
00:59:26,496 --> 00:59:28,915
There's always somebody
behind these doors.

837
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,922
What was that... like a five iron?

838
00:59:59,618 --> 01:00:01,119
Come on.

839
01:00:03,038 --> 01:00:05,624
I hate this fucking car!

840
01:00:10,338 --> 01:00:12,591
Can anybody hear me?

841
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:16,804
I do like the trunk though.

842
01:00:16,929 --> 01:00:21,184
Ain't one of them hatchbacks!
Waste of a fucking car!

843
01:00:21,268 --> 01:00:25,564
Cause to me, a car isn't really
a car unless it's got a real trunk.

844
01:00:25,648 --> 01:00:27,567
Shut up!

845
01:00:27,650 --> 01:00:30,820
Hell, doesn't anybody
fucking listen to me?

846
01:00:43,001 --> 01:00:45,713
- Bitch.
- I could give you a jump...

847
01:00:45,796 --> 01:00:47,757
but I don't have any cables.

848
01:00:51,469 --> 01:00:53,346
Hey, you're a lifesaver.

849
01:00:53,638 --> 01:00:56,308
I've been having a lot of
problems with this here car.

850
01:00:57,852 --> 01:01:00,271
I'll just get the cables
out of the back, okay?

851
01:01:06,153 --> 01:01:08,155
Just don't open your mouth, okay?

852
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:10,950
There's gonna be a lot of dead,
dying bystanders. You got me?

853
01:01:13,203 --> 01:01:15,163
Hey, he...

854
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:19,001
he gets motion sickness
really bad and he...

855
01:01:19,085 --> 01:01:21,212
- Are you alright?
- has to travel back here.

856
01:01:21,295 --> 01:01:23,798
Oh yeah, yeah. I'm alright.

857
01:01:24,174 --> 01:01:26,426
I just feel like I gotta heave.

858
01:01:27,386 --> 01:01:29,722
Are we leaving pretty
soon, Bobby Ray?

859
01:01:29,805 --> 01:01:32,183
Oh yeah. Yeah, Dad.

860
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:34,227
We're gonna be going as soon as
this nice lady gives us a jump.

861
01:01:34,310 --> 01:01:36,146
Okay? Just watch your knee.

862
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:40,901
He's a little...

863
01:01:41,402 --> 01:01:43,738
He's a little... you know, crazy.

864
01:01:43,821 --> 01:01:47,326
He suffers from... What's that thing
where you fear being outside?

865
01:01:47,409 --> 01:01:49,411
- It's called...
- Agoraphobia?

866
01:01:49,495 --> 01:01:50,955
Yeah! Agoraphobia.

867
01:01:59,256 --> 01:02:00,799
Shit!

868
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:15,275
Fuck!

869
01:02:24,118 --> 01:02:26,037
Man, it's not your day?

870
01:02:33,838 --> 01:02:37,425
It's... red positive, black negative.

871
01:02:37,509 --> 01:02:39,261
Yeah. I know.

872
01:02:40,137 --> 01:02:43,974
I mean, you... you should have
seen how hard it was just to...

873
01:02:44,058 --> 01:02:45,518
just to get him out of
the house this morning.

874
01:02:45,601 --> 01:02:49,189
I mean, just a little trip
to the bank was like a...

875
01:02:49,272 --> 01:02:51,316
like a nightmare. I mean...

876
01:02:51,859 --> 01:02:53,152
it just seems like it's that way...

877
01:02:53,235 --> 01:02:56,614
with everybody these days. You know,
everybody has some sort of...

878
01:02:56,697 --> 01:03:00,160
some sort of excuse for... something
they're not doing or some sort of...

879
01:03:00,243 --> 01:03:03,622
you know, childhood psycho problem
for, you know, for the way they are.

880
01:03:03,706 --> 01:03:05,791
And to me, it's just... I don't know.

881
01:03:05,875 --> 01:03:09,254
I just think it's bullshit. I...
I just think people are afraid.

882
01:03:10,005 --> 01:03:11,298
Afraid?

883
01:03:11,798 --> 01:03:13,300
Afraid of what?

884
01:03:14,259 --> 01:03:16,721
Well, they're afraid of
everything, really.

885
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:19,516
But...

886
01:03:20,517 --> 01:03:24,396
mostly, they're...
afraid of themselves.

887
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:31,696
You baking back there, old man?

888
01:03:34,992 --> 01:03:39,247
If you don't get me out of
this fucking trunk right now...

889
01:03:39,330 --> 01:03:41,583
you're not gonna see a dime.

890
01:03:41,958 --> 01:03:43,460
You hear me?

891
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:47,840
Get your toaster or whatever,
I don't give a shit what you do...

892
01:03:47,923 --> 01:03:50,468
you gotta get me out of
here right now!

893
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:55,682
Hey... hey, man, I know
where you're coming from.

894
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:00,062
I told him, leave the old man
with me. He don't have to travel.

895
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:02,273
Get what I'm saying? Cause
I'm looking out for you.

896
01:04:02,357 --> 01:04:04,776
You're dealing with
a crazy motherfucker.

897
01:04:05,027 --> 01:04:08,030
I mean, he don't know the difference
between pussy and money.

898
01:04:08,113 --> 01:04:11,659
Jesus Christ! What the hell
are you talking about?

899
01:04:15,122 --> 01:04:16,540
Every day...

900
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:21,796
I get up and I go over to
my coffee shop, have a mocha.

901
01:04:22,005 --> 01:04:23,673
And you know what I see?

902
01:04:24,007 --> 01:04:26,468
I see a titty bar across the way.

903
01:04:26,718 --> 01:04:29,013
Big picture of this babe, big.

904
01:04:29,096 --> 01:04:31,557
I mean, it takes up
the whole side of the building.

905
01:04:32,308 --> 01:04:36,605
I see this picture
every day for a year.

906
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:39,525
And I think, "Man, wow!"

907
01:04:41,319 --> 01:04:44,948
So, I meet the owner
and we start talking.

908
01:04:45,782 --> 01:04:47,826
He's real friendly,
you know, real helpful...

909
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,703
tells me about the business.

910
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:53,541
You see, when I went to
a... community college

911
01:04:54,167 --> 01:04:56,670
I spent an entire summer
reading Freud.

912
01:04:56,753 --> 01:04:58,964
Now, I'd sit in
that library every day...

913
01:04:59,047 --> 01:05:02,093
until I read every one of
his books. And then...

914
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:05,847
I just stopped because
it was all there.

915
01:05:06,514 --> 01:05:07,974
What was there?

916
01:05:08,558 --> 01:05:14,148
Well, it's simple really.
It's... wish fulfillment.

917
01:05:14,399 --> 01:05:17,569
I mean, you have a wish
and it has to be fulfilled.

918
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:20,948
Otherwise, you just... go crazy.

919
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:23,284
And of course, it's...

920
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,955
it's very important
to have good sex too.

921
01:05:27,330 --> 01:05:28,665
Always.

922
01:05:28,999 --> 01:05:31,710
I want to open up a place in Belize.

923
01:05:31,835 --> 01:05:33,963
And he thinks it's a good idea.

924
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,840
See, I got a lot of ideas.

925
01:05:35,923 --> 01:05:38,301
Now, I got dreams, I got drive.

926
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:40,178
I've got new blood.

927
01:05:41,722 --> 01:05:44,725
You crazy motherfucker,
you've got dreams!

928
01:05:44,850 --> 01:05:46,769
Everybody's got dreams.

929
01:05:46,853 --> 01:05:49,481
I'm dreaming about
getting out of this trunk.

930
01:05:50,607 --> 01:05:53,319
That's what I'm talking about. See?

931
01:05:55,363 --> 01:05:58,491
Bobby Ray, he's out of control.

932
01:05:58,575 --> 01:06:00,368
You don't know what he's going to do.

933
01:06:00,452 --> 01:06:02,120
So, I'm saying...

934
01:06:02,371 --> 01:06:03,747
listen to me.

935
01:06:05,791 --> 01:06:07,460
I'm a businessman.

936
01:06:08,628 --> 01:06:10,672
Maybe we can make a deal.

937
01:06:11,673 --> 01:06:13,592
We can make a deal.

938
01:06:14,802 --> 01:06:18,556
Get me... into the back seat.
We can start talking.

939
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:19,933
Alright...

940
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:23,520
you got it! Come here.

941
01:06:24,938 --> 01:06:27,108
You look out for Natalie, don't you?

942
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,819
She's a real nice piece of work.

943
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:35,117
She talks about you all the time.

944
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,621
She says you built
a lot of this city.

945
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:41,291
Hey, building's good work.

946
01:06:45,921 --> 01:06:48,007
- Now...
- Don't touch that.

947
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:51,970
- How's it feel?
- It's okay. It sting a little.

948
01:06:54,848 --> 01:06:56,308
Well... Boy, that was nasty,
I'm telling you.

949
01:06:56,392 --> 01:06:58,394
But I think it's
going to heal alright.

950
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:01,147
It's going to leave
a little bit of a scar though.

951
01:07:03,233 --> 01:07:05,193
I think you saved my life.

952
01:07:05,944 --> 01:07:07,863
I wouldn't go that far.

953
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:16,915
It's to... make it heal faster.

954
01:07:19,585 --> 01:07:21,671
You are nice, snake man.

955
01:07:23,089 --> 01:07:24,549
I like you.

956
01:07:25,383 --> 01:07:26,969
I like you.

957
01:07:31,265 --> 01:07:33,142
Are you afraid of snakes?

958
01:07:33,768 --> 01:07:36,062
Me? No.

959
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:38,607
Not really.

960
01:07:46,116 --> 01:07:48,118
The number.

961
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:52,039
Hey.

962
01:08:42,389 --> 01:08:44,058
You see what I mean?

963
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:47,145
I can solve two of
your problems at once.

964
01:08:47,729 --> 01:08:49,814
What do you think?
It's worth the price?

965
01:08:50,690 --> 01:08:51,984
Wanna touch him?

966
01:08:52,067 --> 01:08:53,193
Go ahead, come on.
You wanna touch him?

967
01:08:53,277 --> 01:08:54,779
- No.
- Go ahead. He won't spit.

968
01:08:54,862 --> 01:08:57,615
I know, because those...
cobras, they spit.

969
01:08:57,699 --> 01:09:00,702
That's right. Very good.
This is a western diamondback.

970
01:09:00,786 --> 01:09:02,496
Their venom is just
as strong as a cobra...

971
01:09:02,579 --> 01:09:04,665
it's a very strong neurotoxin.

972
01:09:04,748 --> 01:09:06,375
Go ahead, touch him.

973
01:09:07,752 --> 01:09:09,587
- Soft.
- Soft?

974
01:09:11,339 --> 01:09:12,466
Hey...

975
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:14,718
what's your name?

976
01:09:14,802 --> 01:09:17,096
- Dot.
- Dot.

977
01:09:17,263 --> 01:09:18,848
Short for Dotty.

978
01:09:18,932 --> 01:09:22,269
- I'm Jerry. This is Ted.
- Ted.

979
01:09:22,352 --> 01:09:25,522
Dot. I like that. Very specific.

980
01:09:25,689 --> 01:09:28,109
You know, I'm experimenting with
something totally incredible.

981
01:09:28,192 --> 01:09:30,320
I mean, something totally unique.

982
01:09:30,445 --> 01:09:32,823
Do you want to experience
something totally unique?

983
01:09:33,240 --> 01:09:36,911
Something that'll make you
feel... immortal?

984
01:09:37,244 --> 01:09:38,538
What is it?

985
01:09:38,788 --> 01:09:41,458
It's kinda scary.
It's sort of like...

986
01:09:41,541 --> 01:09:43,919
strapping yourself to
the front of a roller coaster...

987
01:09:44,002 --> 01:09:45,921
only it's a lot more intense.

988
01:09:46,005 --> 01:09:48,716
- Roller coaster?
- Yeah.

989
01:09:55,599 --> 01:09:59,061
- I do him, we drive.
- Where to?

990
01:09:59,604 --> 01:10:02,774
I got a place I gotta cross.
There's still the price.

991
01:10:03,233 --> 01:10:04,609
You got a deal.

992
01:10:11,159 --> 01:10:13,036
Nice shot, Bobby Ray.

993
01:10:15,414 --> 01:10:18,375
Shit! No answer at Marvin's.

994
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:20,378
Oh, man.

995
01:10:20,836 --> 01:10:23,757
That's the only way he could
have known where we'd be.

996
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:26,718
He's got Marvin. Damn!
He's got Marvin.

997
01:10:29,597 --> 01:10:31,265
I think we should go over there.

998
01:10:31,349 --> 01:10:33,768
Men are such pigs.

999
01:10:36,605 --> 01:10:39,149
I bet the women's
isn't this disgusting.

1000
01:10:40,359 --> 01:10:43,196
I can't believe that
I let you fuck me.

1001
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:46,575
I just saved your fucking life!

1002
01:10:47,075 --> 01:10:49,203
They weren't shooting at me.

1003
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:51,914
Hey!

1004
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:55,376
This is private. Take a walk!

1005
01:10:56,044 --> 01:10:59,089
I don't know what you two
got going and I don't care...

1006
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,467
but I got to piss bad.

1007
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:06,765
I don't have anywhere else to go.
My cab is still idling.

1008
01:11:07,557 --> 01:11:09,518
I don't piss in the street.

1009
01:11:09,601 --> 01:11:12,188
Let the man piss, for Christ's sake.

1010
01:11:12,313 --> 01:11:13,648
Thank you.

1011
01:11:17,861 --> 01:11:20,072
Why'd you say that about fucking me?

1012
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:24,285
Cause you're a fucking loser.
Cause people are shooting at me...

1013
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:27,372
and because I'm stuck
in a public men's toilet.

1014
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:29,541
I ain't a loser!
Why do you say that shit?

1015
01:11:29,666 --> 01:11:31,376
Oh God. And now, you're gonna whine.

1016
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:34,463
God, men are such egomaniacs.

1017
01:11:34,547 --> 01:11:39,845
One little negative comment and
your whole fragile ego just crumbles.

1018
01:11:40,679 --> 01:11:44,350
Well, I thought it was really great.
I mean, you were into it.

1019
01:11:44,642 --> 01:11:47,061
I mean, don't say
you're sorry you fucked me.

1020
01:11:47,395 --> 01:11:49,189
It was a mistake.

1021
01:11:49,314 --> 01:11:52,609
See, I always get myself
involved with the wrong people.

1022
01:11:52,693 --> 01:11:55,029
It's not your fault. Okay?

1023
01:11:55,279 --> 01:11:58,825
Now, you're calling me wrong?
I don't like that shit.

1024
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:06,626
This whole area used to be the
back lot of Twentieth Century Fox.

1025
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:08,294
No shit.

1026
01:12:08,419 --> 01:12:10,005
See that building over there?

1027
01:12:10,088 --> 01:12:11,423
- Where?
- That's where Ronald Reagan...

1028
01:12:11,506 --> 01:12:13,050
has his office.

1029
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:17,263
Oh my God. You mean
the gipper himself?

1030
01:12:17,346 --> 01:12:18,598
You know it.

1031
01:12:18,890 --> 01:12:20,809
Old Mr Trickle Down?

1032
01:12:20,976 --> 01:12:23,896
That shit never trickled
down to us, did it?

1033
01:12:24,521 --> 01:12:26,607
Are you a Republican, Marvin?

1034
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:29,068
- No. I'm a Democrat.
- Democrat?

1035
01:12:29,152 --> 01:12:32,239
I don't... think I ever voted.

1036
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:34,366
What about you, Leon? Do you... vote?

1037
01:12:34,449 --> 01:12:36,744
I mean, do they let Mayans vote?

1038
01:12:37,078 --> 01:12:40,707
What vote? I don't vote.
You need money to vote.

1039
01:12:40,832 --> 01:12:43,502
Yeah. Hey, you see that, Marvin?

1040
01:12:43,585 --> 01:12:45,671
Me and Leon, we're
your ordinary citizens.

1041
01:12:45,754 --> 01:12:48,424
You see, we don't vote because...
well, it don't mean shit.

1042
01:12:48,507 --> 01:12:50,885
I mean, it's always the same
asshole with a different face.

1043
01:12:50,969 --> 01:12:53,847
You know what I mean?
And so, we create sideshows.

1044
01:12:53,930 --> 01:12:56,892
We create our... own show.

1045
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:58,644
But it probably wouldn't
make a difference...

1046
01:12:58,769 --> 01:13:02,857
cause I don't really think they'd...
let a duckfucker vote anyway.

1047
01:13:03,358 --> 01:13:05,903
I told you I don't fuck ducks.

1048
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:08,113
Quack, quack.

1049
01:13:10,116 --> 01:13:12,118
So, what kind of bank
did you say this is anyway?

1050
01:13:12,201 --> 01:13:14,913
- It's a private bank.
- Right, a... private bank.

1051
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:16,290
I mean, isn't that illegal...

1052
01:13:16,373 --> 01:13:18,626
- or something?
- No, it isn't.

1053
01:13:18,834 --> 01:13:20,002
You learn something new every day...

1054
01:13:20,086 --> 01:13:23,131
because I didn't know
you could have a private bank.

1055
01:13:35,353 --> 01:13:37,064
Let's go, Grandpa.

1056
01:13:55,084 --> 01:13:56,336
Hello.

1057
01:13:57,045 --> 01:13:58,296
Where am I?

1058
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:04,178
In an ambulance. You've
been shot. You passed out.

1059
01:14:07,682 --> 01:14:09,893
Go ahead. Just... you... go ahead.

1060
01:14:09,977 --> 01:14:13,648
How bad is it? And don't lie to me.

1061
01:14:14,065 --> 01:14:15,400
Flesh wound.

1062
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:21,407
Sir?

1063
01:14:22,199 --> 01:14:24,452
We're gonna have to
stop the ambulance now.

1064
01:14:25,119 --> 01:14:27,539
Can't do that, Jack. We're expected.

1065
01:14:27,789 --> 01:14:29,458
We need to stop
the ambulance right now!

1066
01:14:29,541 --> 01:14:34,797
Because I know who did this
horrible thing to me. I do.

1067
01:14:34,881 --> 01:14:36,382
And I'm going to make her pay.

1068
01:14:36,466 --> 01:14:39,886
Every single remaining
miserable minute of her life.

1069
01:14:39,970 --> 01:14:42,055
Just relax. We'll be there soon.

1070
01:14:42,139 --> 01:14:44,767
There is no relaxing,
you don't understand.

1071
01:14:44,850 --> 01:14:46,602
She's trying to kill me.

1072
01:14:46,686 --> 01:14:48,813
She's trying to...

1073
01:14:56,531 --> 01:14:57,740
Hey, you!

1074
01:14:59,701 --> 01:15:03,038
How come there's no ambulance
siren going off right now?

1075
01:15:03,122 --> 01:15:05,332
If we're in some big ambulance?

1076
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:07,335
You'll be okay. No need for one.

1077
01:15:07,418 --> 01:15:09,963
Oh yeah? I'll tell you
what, Mister...

1078
01:15:10,046 --> 01:15:14,301
Mister... Mister Fincher.
Mister... Mister Guy.

1079
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,929
How about some I.D. right now?
That's... what I'd like to see.

1080
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,431
Right now!

1081
01:15:19,307 --> 01:15:22,436
- I.D. for what?
- Well, you don't strike me...

1082
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:26,524
exactly as a... paramedic worker.
As an E.M.S. guy.

1083
01:15:27,066 --> 01:15:30,361
- I'm in training.
- Great! Somebody in training.

1084
01:15:30,445 --> 01:15:32,489
That's just exactly what I need
with a bullet in my leg.

1085
01:15:32,572 --> 01:15:34,658
Hey, maybe you hit your head
when you fell down.

1086
01:15:34,741 --> 01:15:37,745
Why don't you just chill out?
You'll be okay.

1087
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:39,914
She was probably just mad at you...

1088
01:15:41,082 --> 01:15:45,295
You know how they get. Just wanna
cut it off, feed it to the ducks.

1089
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:49,842
Hey, Mr Man. Excuse me.

1090
01:15:50,259 --> 01:15:51,636
Mr Trainee...

1091
01:15:51,928 --> 01:15:53,555
how much did she pay you?

1092
01:15:53,763 --> 01:15:56,016
Was this a big score for you?

1093
01:15:56,100 --> 01:15:58,310
A lot of money?
Cut off a man's penis?

1094
01:16:00,688 --> 01:16:02,398
She didn't pay me anything.

1095
01:16:03,566 --> 01:16:05,277
That's some sick shit.

1096
01:16:05,736 --> 01:16:07,404
That makes you a sick motherfucker.

1097
01:16:07,488 --> 01:16:09,991
Just... the whole thing...
just for joy.

1098
01:16:10,116 --> 01:16:12,994
Joy. You have nothing better to do
but to get involved...

1099
01:16:13,077 --> 01:16:15,038
in conspiracies
to cut off a man's penis.

1100
01:16:15,122 --> 01:16:18,876
- You're a sick motherfucker...
- Hey, hey man! Stop.

1101
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,519
You forgot something.

1102
01:16:50,996 --> 01:16:52,123
Hi.

1103
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:56,336
Name is Bond... Jaime Bond.

1104
01:17:00,591 --> 01:17:02,176
Race car driver.

1105
01:17:41,221 --> 01:17:42,431
Wait here.

1106
01:18:04,999 --> 01:18:06,626
What the fuck are you looking for?

1107
01:18:06,709 --> 01:18:08,544
Something personal.

1108
01:18:10,004 --> 01:18:12,007
What is it with you and Marvin?

1109
01:18:12,549 --> 01:18:15,386
I mean, you got a real thorn
up your ass about him.

1110
01:18:16,512 --> 01:18:18,806
All he seems to do is help you out.

1111
01:18:18,931 --> 01:18:21,309
You know, I... don't get it.

1112
01:18:21,518 --> 01:18:23,353
What's he... what's he done to you?

1113
01:18:24,062 --> 01:18:27,400
It's not what he's done,
it's what he hasn't done.

1114
01:18:30,570 --> 01:18:32,614
Has he ever talked to you
about my mother?

1115
01:18:32,697 --> 01:18:35,659
Yeah. Sometimes, I can't
get him to shut up.

1116
01:18:37,119 --> 01:18:38,913
She was the best.

1117
01:18:40,206 --> 01:18:41,499
Yeah.

1118
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:44,753
Yeah, I know he's in love with her.

1119
01:18:45,546 --> 01:18:49,801
See, she left when I was about six.
She just sorta vanished.

1120
01:18:49,884 --> 01:18:51,678
So, I grew up with my aunt.

1121
01:18:51,761 --> 01:18:56,433
Marvin, he paid for my schooling
and lots of other things.

1122
01:18:56,558 --> 01:18:58,352
I mean, why'd he do that?

1123
01:18:59,937 --> 01:19:03,942
I don't know. I guess... he had
this thing for your mother.

1124
01:19:04,609 --> 01:19:06,904
- Maybe.
- What do you think?

1125
01:19:07,237 --> 01:19:10,408
I think that nobody tells me shit.

1126
01:19:14,412 --> 01:19:16,039
Jack, come here.

1127
01:19:17,082 --> 01:19:18,584
Look at me.

1128
01:19:19,001 --> 01:19:20,544
Do you...

1129
01:19:20,628 --> 01:19:25,050
think that I have any features
that might slightly resemble...

1130
01:19:25,467 --> 01:19:28,011
What the hell is so fucking funny?

1131
01:19:28,846 --> 01:19:31,474
To think that you might
actually be his daughter.

1132
01:19:33,017 --> 01:19:34,269
Well...

1133
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:40,985
Well, I don't really see anything.
I mean, but that don't mean nothing.

1134
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,153
I mean...

1135
01:19:43,738 --> 01:19:46,741
you got some of the same
psychological things.

1136
01:19:46,867 --> 01:19:48,118
Like what?

1137
01:19:48,201 --> 01:19:50,704
You believe everything's
a conspiracy, for one.

1138
01:19:50,788 --> 01:19:53,750
And you got that same
hard-ass attitude.

1139
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:57,462
- Fuck you, Jack!
- Well, have you ever asked him?

1140
01:19:58,463 --> 01:20:00,257
No, not really.

1141
01:20:00,549 --> 01:20:03,511
I mean, I've hinted around
a little and...

1142
01:20:03,594 --> 01:20:07,432
he just goes into this total act.
He just closes up.

1143
01:20:07,933 --> 01:20:11,103
He ever tell you why
your mother left?

1144
01:20:11,186 --> 01:20:13,689
No. He said he wasn't sure.

1145
01:20:13,773 --> 01:20:17,193
He said that she was having
a tough time and...

1146
01:20:17,277 --> 01:20:19,613
she had some kind of breakdown.

1147
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:21,240
But then...

1148
01:20:21,699 --> 01:20:23,200
who knows?

1149
01:20:29,750 --> 01:20:31,126
Shit!

1150
01:20:33,003 --> 01:20:35,006
What do we have here?

1151
01:20:35,089 --> 01:20:37,050
Hey, look at you!

1152
01:20:38,009 --> 01:20:39,344
Maybe we...

1153
01:20:41,221 --> 01:20:42,931
If you were a little bigger...

1154
01:20:43,265 --> 01:20:44,558
you and me, we could have something.

1155
01:20:44,642 --> 01:20:46,519
You could work for me, baby.

1156
01:20:47,896 --> 01:20:49,606
You're pretty cute.

1157
01:20:50,565 --> 01:20:52,568
Let's see what you got on top.

1158
01:20:53,318 --> 01:20:56,489
Come on. Take it off slowly.

1159
01:20:56,864 --> 01:20:59,075
Tease me. Yeah.

1160
01:20:59,492 --> 01:21:02,579
You're teasing me? You're a teaser?

1161
01:21:03,372 --> 01:21:04,456
Yes.

1162
01:21:04,915 --> 01:21:06,167
Baby.

1163
01:21:07,043 --> 01:21:09,128
That's a nice pair, baby.

1164
01:21:11,506 --> 01:21:13,717
Leon, yeah!

1165
01:21:13,884 --> 01:21:17,096
Leon!

1166
01:21:18,931 --> 01:21:20,725
Well, this is it.

1167
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,021
This is the anti-venom.

1168
01:21:25,397 --> 01:21:28,234
Here, a small one for you
and a big one for me.

1169
01:21:28,568 --> 01:21:30,028
Ready? Drink it.

1170
01:21:30,111 --> 01:21:33,240
It takes about two minutes before
it gets into the blood system.

1171
01:21:33,323 --> 01:21:35,743
Then, home free.

1172
01:21:38,496 --> 01:21:40,290
I'll go move the tarp.

1173
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:46,422
Don't know why I am
always taking drugs.

1174
01:21:48,507 --> 01:21:51,636
You know, a doctor once told me...

1175
01:21:51,928 --> 01:21:54,222
I have a disorder.

1176
01:21:55,807 --> 01:21:57,601
She called it what...

1177
01:21:58,060 --> 01:21:59,353
compulsive.

1178
01:21:59,437 --> 01:22:03,233
You know, like, you know,
one minute I'm like a maniac and...

1179
01:22:03,316 --> 01:22:04,901
the next, I'm...

1180
01:22:05,110 --> 01:22:07,112
I'm quiet like a baby.

1181
01:22:10,992 --> 01:22:12,994
Like when I'm first born...

1182
01:22:13,745 --> 01:22:15,330
very calm.

1183
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:18,584
I was a calm baby.

1184
01:22:27,094 --> 01:22:28,762
Come on, have a look.

1185
01:22:36,229 --> 01:22:39,149
Look at 'em. Aren't they beautiful?

1186
01:22:47,951 --> 01:22:52,331
Yeah, I thought there would be
one or two, not so many.

1187
01:22:52,456 --> 01:22:54,542
No, this is what I've been
experimenting with.

1188
01:22:54,626 --> 01:22:56,836
This is what I was telling you about.

1189
01:23:01,467 --> 01:23:03,845
Jerry, if I do this...

1190
01:23:04,470 --> 01:23:06,181
you have to marry me.

1191
01:23:06,473 --> 01:23:09,184
- Sure. Okay.
- No, you know, I'm serious.

1192
01:23:09,267 --> 01:23:12,396
This is... not funny. This is
not like taking drugs.

1193
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:14,190
No. I... look, I know it's not funny.

1194
01:23:14,273 --> 01:23:15,900
I know it's serious, but
you told me you were...

1195
01:23:15,984 --> 01:23:19,029
- you weren't afraid of snakes.
- No, I'm not afr...

1196
01:23:19,321 --> 01:23:22,741
- You know, I don't feel so good.
- Okay, look, Dot... listen.

1197
01:23:22,825 --> 01:23:26,579
Just relax, okay? I mean, this is...
what I was talking about.

1198
01:23:26,663 --> 01:23:29,791
Combining opposites.
I mean, it's totally safe.

1199
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:32,044
The ant... you know what?

1200
01:23:32,544 --> 01:23:34,255
If you do this for me...

1201
01:23:34,672 --> 01:23:36,174
I'll marry you.

1202
01:23:40,220 --> 01:23:41,805
If I do this...

1203
01:23:42,681 --> 01:23:44,767
I'm going to close my eyes.

1204
01:23:45,643 --> 01:23:46,894
Okay.

1205
01:23:47,437 --> 01:23:48,605
Come on.

1206
01:26:43,974 --> 01:26:46,269
Oh, shit!

1207
01:26:48,354 --> 01:26:51,066
Sweetheart!

1208
01:26:52,067 --> 01:26:53,444
Laura, come here!

1209
01:26:54,695 --> 01:26:59,033
The car... I bought
the fucking thing for you.

1210
01:27:03,914 --> 01:27:05,165
Laura!

1211
01:27:05,583 --> 01:27:07,126
Come here, honey!

1212
01:27:07,502 --> 01:27:10,714
I gotta... just talk
to you for a second.

1213
01:27:40,581 --> 01:27:41,624
What are you doing?

1214
01:27:41,708 --> 01:27:44,127
Well, I'm making a mushroom
and scallion omelet.

1215
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:47,172
- What are you doing?
- No, I... need to use your phone.

1216
01:27:47,256 --> 01:27:49,091
It's an emergency.

1217
01:28:02,649 --> 01:28:05,235
Fucking outrageous! The mother lode.

1218
01:28:05,318 --> 01:28:08,906
- You get all the money?
- Sweet as a young girl's ass.

1219
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,952
You know, even if there's
a S.W.A.T. team out there, I'm ready.

1220
01:28:13,369 --> 01:28:15,664
- Is there a S.W.A.T. team out there?
- No.

1221
01:28:15,789 --> 01:28:17,833
- Shit!
- Bobby Ray, you know...

1222
01:28:17,916 --> 01:28:20,211
I told you I never fuck ducks.

1223
01:28:20,544 --> 01:28:23,172
Why are you always
telling me I fuck ducks?

1224
01:28:23,673 --> 01:28:25,675
I don't fuck ducks.

1225
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:35,520
Fuck!

1226
01:28:39,650 --> 01:28:41,318
Your turn to drive!

1227
01:28:51,747 --> 01:28:53,666
Head for the four-oh-five.

1228
01:29:13,397 --> 01:29:14,982
Laura, I know you're in here!

1229
01:29:15,066 --> 01:29:19,780
You nasty lowlife, disgusting
cold-hearted bitch!

1230
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:25,411
What happened, Joe?

1231
01:29:25,536 --> 01:29:28,498
I was humiliated.

1232
01:29:29,040 --> 01:29:32,586
I was beaten. I was shot.

1233
01:29:32,753 --> 01:29:36,424
My ear is missing.
Have you seen me lately?

1234
01:29:36,507 --> 01:29:40,137
All because you just had to pull off
that little stunt, didn't you?

1235
01:29:40,429 --> 01:29:43,265
Well, now, I'm going to give you
some of your own medicine.

1236
01:29:43,349 --> 01:29:46,269
Look, it was a test
and you failed it...

1237
01:29:46,352 --> 01:29:50,357
because you couldn't keep
your pants up. You ruined everything!

1238
01:29:51,608 --> 01:29:53,944
I ruined everything?

1239
01:29:54,862 --> 01:29:56,906
Give me a break!

1240
01:29:56,989 --> 01:30:01,495
I mean, come on! You got some nerve!
You sicked a hooker on me!

1241
01:30:01,578 --> 01:30:05,708
No, she was not a hooker.
She was a love decoy.

1242
01:30:05,791 --> 01:30:08,503
What the hell is a love decoy?

1243
01:30:09,045 --> 01:30:12,340
Do you understand that none
of this would have happened...

1244
01:30:12,424 --> 01:30:15,469
unless you planned it?
Do you see how sick that is?

1245
01:30:15,552 --> 01:30:17,597
I mean, what do you do at night?

1246
01:30:17,680 --> 01:30:21,518
How do you come up with
these... cockamamie things?

1247
01:30:21,601 --> 01:30:24,021
Do you sit home
and think to yourself...

1248
01:30:24,313 --> 01:30:30,445
"I wonder what would happen if I set
my beautiful, young fiance up...

1249
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:33,824
with this firm, young,
ultra-gorgeous bitch?"

1250
01:30:33,907 --> 01:30:36,619
That, what did you...
think would happen?

1251
01:30:36,702 --> 01:30:39,956
I had to know. I'm the jealous type.

1252
01:30:40,039 --> 01:30:43,585
And it's very hard for me
to trust people.

1253
01:30:43,668 --> 01:30:48,799
So, you've gotta... set things up
so that you make sure they fail?

1254
01:30:48,883 --> 01:30:52,512
Is that the idea? You couldn't stand
if somebody was faithful to you?

1255
01:30:52,595 --> 01:30:56,099
- Would that just drive you nuts?
- I'm sorry!

1256
01:30:56,183 --> 01:30:58,519
I... maybe it was
the wrong thing to do.

1257
01:30:58,602 --> 01:30:59,770
Maybe I shouldn't have done it.

1258
01:30:59,854 --> 01:31:02,524
You know, but maybe I needed
to know that you cared.

1259
01:31:02,607 --> 01:31:04,109
Care?

1260
01:31:04,568 --> 01:31:08,572
Laura, sweetheart, being with you...

1261
01:31:08,739 --> 01:31:12,994
is like being shot out of
a circus cannon every day...

1262
01:31:13,077 --> 01:31:16,331
without a net into a pool of cactus.

1263
01:31:16,415 --> 01:31:18,834
It literally is like eating nails...

1264
01:31:18,917 --> 01:31:20,378
- honey. It is like...
- Joe...

1265
01:31:20,461 --> 01:31:23,923
drinking... gasoline.
That's what it's like.

1266
01:31:24,007 --> 01:31:27,719
You do care. You do care, Joe.

1267
01:31:27,844 --> 01:31:30,431
- Of course I do.
- I know that I'm a handful...

1268
01:31:30,514 --> 01:31:32,308
and I know
that you put up with a lot...

1269
01:31:32,391 --> 01:31:35,937
but I can't help myself. I'm sorry.
I'm afraid things are gonna...

1270
01:31:36,021 --> 01:31:38,440
- get too normal.
- Too normal?

1271
01:31:38,524 --> 01:31:39,733
Laura...

1272
01:31:40,609 --> 01:31:41,986
look at me.

1273
01:31:44,072 --> 01:31:48,911
They could never, ever
going to get too normal.

1274
01:31:51,872 --> 01:31:53,374
Joe.

1275
01:31:53,833 --> 01:31:55,794
- Joe...
- My ear!

1276
01:31:58,046 --> 01:31:59,089
- Joe.
- I love you.

1277
01:31:59,172 --> 01:32:02,259
- I love you too, Joe. I'm sorry.
- Baby.

1278
01:32:05,013 --> 01:32:07,807
Welcome to Thrifty Drugs.
Thank you for shopping with us.

1279
01:32:07,891 --> 01:32:09,434
It's not as sticky.

1280
01:32:09,518 --> 01:32:11,645
Yeah, okay, but it tastes bad.

1281
01:32:17,026 --> 01:32:20,197
Man, I wish you were back on
the pill, I hate buying these things.

1282
01:32:20,656 --> 01:32:21,824
Hey.

1283
01:32:32,503 --> 01:32:34,004
Man.

1284
01:32:36,758 --> 01:32:38,593
It's not as bad as it looks.

1285
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:43,724
I got struck by lightning once...

1286
01:32:44,683 --> 01:32:46,769
all it did was singe my hair.

1287
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:50,774
You got any Super Glue?

1288
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:54,486
Yeah. Here. Okay.

1289
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:57,406
And one of those...

1290
01:34:22,088 --> 01:34:24,007
What the hell are you going
to do with the money?

1291
01:34:24,132 --> 01:34:26,384
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

1292
01:34:27,177 --> 01:34:28,720
Like I told you...

1293
01:34:29,012 --> 01:34:31,349
I'm gonna open up a nudie club.

1294
01:34:31,682 --> 01:34:34,018
See, I've been thinking
about it a long time.

1295
01:34:34,102 --> 01:34:35,895
And I know the location.

1296
01:34:35,979 --> 01:34:39,817
Lots of tourists, rich tourists
with plenty of spending cash.

1297
01:34:39,900 --> 01:34:44,030
See, all you need is a bar,
a stage, some poles...

1298
01:34:44,113 --> 01:34:45,532
crank out some good music and man...

1299
01:34:45,615 --> 01:34:47,993
you're rolling in
plenty of green chili.

1300
01:34:48,076 --> 01:34:51,163
And I got an idea. What you need...

1301
01:34:51,247 --> 01:34:52,832
is good lighting.

1302
01:34:53,249 --> 01:34:57,462
You get a nice blonde girl,
put her in some pink lights...

1303
01:34:57,838 --> 01:34:59,715
and man, that's all you need.

1304
01:34:59,798 --> 01:35:01,926
And pink is the best color.

1305
01:35:03,678 --> 01:35:05,847
You know, yellow's nice too.

1306
01:35:06,723 --> 01:35:10,602
When I open up my club,
I'm gonna get a porn star.

1307
01:35:10,936 --> 01:35:13,105
You know, get some publicity
and stuff like that.

1308
01:35:13,189 --> 01:35:16,734
And I'm gonna hire a guy
to paint a mural outside.

1309
01:35:16,860 --> 01:35:18,653
On the outside wall. Real nice mural.

1310
01:35:18,737 --> 01:35:23,325
I mean, a nice blonde laying down.

1311
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:27,747
Some big tits,
a waterfall behind her.

1312
01:35:27,831 --> 01:35:31,543
I mean, classy. You know,
people see that and think.

1313
01:36:00,577 --> 01:36:02,120
Oh, man.

1314
01:36:04,081 --> 01:36:05,916
What is all this shit?

1315
01:36:16,011 --> 01:36:18,681
Did you know this shit can
blow up and burn down your house?

1316
01:36:45,504 --> 01:36:47,298
Hey, Natalie!

1317
01:36:51,260 --> 01:36:54,055
That was real cute
setting me up with Leon!

1318
01:36:56,016 --> 01:37:00,146
- Where is he?
- I don't know! He's not with you?

1319
01:37:00,229 --> 01:37:03,066
That's real... that's real funny!

1320
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:08,155
Who's your boyfriend?

1321
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,866
Hey, boyfriend!

1322
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:16,248
I've got a real high tolerance
for pain. I sure hope you do!

1323
01:37:24,424 --> 01:37:26,218
Bobby Ray!

1324
01:37:26,635 --> 01:37:28,512
Bobby Ray!

1325
01:37:29,304 --> 01:37:33,476
Jack's dick's got
more brains than you do!

1326
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:46,032
Natalie, come back here
right now! Natalie!

1327
01:38:22,616 --> 01:38:24,368
You like Natalie a lot?

1328
01:38:25,244 --> 01:38:28,498
Let me tell you something about her.
I think you deserve to know.

1329
01:38:28,581 --> 01:38:31,209
This whole money thing was her idea.

1330
01:38:31,293 --> 01:38:34,797
I mean, not the way it turned out,
but it was her idea.

1331
01:38:35,089 --> 01:38:38,051
I had a feeling about it,
but I wasn't sure.

1332
01:38:38,593 --> 01:38:40,595
Don't mean she don't like you.

1333
01:38:41,847 --> 01:38:43,223
Wait a minute.

1334
01:39:27,900 --> 01:39:30,695
- Hot enough for you?
- Shit.

1335
01:39:38,371 --> 01:39:40,206
How do you like this border?

1336
01:39:42,375 --> 01:39:45,003
Legal... illegal.

1337
01:39:47,089 --> 01:39:49,342
Un... fucking... believable.

1338
01:39:55,349 --> 01:39:56,850
Car is yours.

1339
01:39:57,434 --> 01:39:59,395
I don't need the hassle.

1340
01:40:00,229 --> 01:40:02,690
That can get you in
deep shit real quick.

1341
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:19,084
When I open up my club...

1342
01:40:19,418 --> 01:40:21,170
I'll send you a postcard.

1343
01:40:22,171 --> 01:40:23,882
Maybe you'll come and visit.

1344
01:40:25,342 --> 01:40:28,387
Sure. I'm paying for it.

1345
01:40:29,304 --> 01:40:30,681
Hey, Leon.

1346
01:40:32,099 --> 01:40:35,061
Blonde ladies, pink lights.

1347
01:40:47,117 --> 01:40:49,536
- [Buenos dias!]
- [Buenos dias!]

1348
01:40:49,620 --> 01:40:51,247
- [Spanish]
- [Spanish]

1349
01:41:54,612 --> 01:41:56,072
You alright?

1350
01:41:56,322 --> 01:41:57,865
Are you hurt?

1351
01:41:58,408 --> 01:42:00,618
- Hi.
- Fuck.

1352
01:42:02,162 --> 01:42:03,747
Have you seen Leon?

1353
01:42:05,499 --> 01:42:06,667
No.

1354
01:42:06,792 --> 01:42:09,337
I think you need to
go to the hospital.

1355
01:42:09,420 --> 01:42:10,714
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1356
01:42:10,797 --> 01:42:12,257
- Okay.
- Can you stand?

1357
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:14,259
- Yeah.
- Okay, we'll get in the car then...

1358
01:42:14,384 --> 01:42:16,887
- okay? Come this way.
- Okay.

1359
01:42:18,681 --> 01:42:20,016
Does that hurt?

1360
01:42:20,099 --> 01:42:23,103
No, it stings a little bit.

1361
01:42:23,395 --> 01:42:24,980
He's got a knife in his head.

1362
01:42:25,063 --> 01:42:27,149
- Okay. In you go.
- Yeah, I know, I saw that. Alright.

1363
01:42:27,233 --> 01:42:29,277
Can you watch out, honey?
Don't hit your head.

1364
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:33,323
- Okay...
- Oh my gosh! Oh dear.

1365
01:42:33,406 --> 01:42:34,825
Watch your fingers.

1366
01:42:35,284 --> 01:42:39,080
Look. Can I... take this for you?

1367
01:42:39,163 --> 01:42:41,124
- It won't...
- Oh dear. Okay, well...

1368
01:42:41,207 --> 01:42:45,045
you hang on to that and
we're gonna get you some help.

1369
01:42:46,296 --> 01:42:47,756
I wonder if we can...

1370
01:42:54,890 --> 01:42:57,810
Jesus Christ. Okay, I think
we should go to Memorial...

1371
01:42:57,893 --> 01:42:58,978
that's probably the closest place.

1372
01:42:59,061 --> 01:43:01,022
No, take him to the clinic.
It's much closer.

1373
01:43:01,105 --> 01:43:04,317
I don't think the clinic's equipped
to handle something like this.

1374
01:43:04,401 --> 01:43:07,070
What do I hear you saying?
I hear you saying...

1375
01:43:07,154 --> 01:43:08,864
that you don't like the clinic.

1376
01:43:08,948 --> 01:43:11,909
Honey, he doesn't need a homeopath
or some guy waving a crystal...

1377
01:43:11,993 --> 01:43:13,745
over his head for a hundred
and sixty bucks a pop.

1378
01:43:13,828 --> 01:43:15,997
I am so tired of
your thinking this way.

1379
01:43:16,081 --> 01:43:18,667
Maybe that's exactly what he needs.
It's what helped me.

1380
01:43:18,751 --> 01:43:20,836
- Those cramps would have gone on...
- Folks.

1381
01:43:20,920 --> 01:43:22,129
You got anything up there to eat?
I'm really...

1382
01:43:22,213 --> 01:43:23,756
- hungry.
- Oh yeah.

1383
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,718
Really, maybe there's like a...

1384
01:43:26,802 --> 01:43:28,053
- Take a look in the...
- A mint?

1385
01:43:28,136 --> 01:43:30,055
- Yeah.
- What are these?

1386
01:43:30,139 --> 01:43:31,182
- Some kind of a...
- Yeah.

1387
01:43:31,265 --> 01:43:34,102
- It's emergency food.
- cheesy, fried food?

1388
01:43:34,185 --> 01:43:35,603
It's not cheesy, fried food.

1389
01:43:35,687 --> 01:43:38,065
- It's got vitamins... Vitamin D.
- You're eating that, aren't you?

1390
01:43:38,148 --> 01:43:39,358
- It's got beta-carotene in it...
- Oh no.

1391
01:43:39,441 --> 01:43:40,567
- it's got salt. You need salt.
- You've got it... Well, you...

1392
01:43:40,651 --> 01:43:43,362
Hey. Stop right over there
and get some hot food!

1393
01:43:43,446 --> 01:43:44,739
I'm really...

1394
01:43:45,490 --> 01:43:46,533
really hungry.

1395
01:43:46,616 --> 01:43:48,952
Are you sure? Because you know,
I don't really think we should stop.

1396
01:43:49,036 --> 01:43:51,497
You really need to
go to a hospital now.

1397
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:53,583
If you don't stop and
get me some food right now...

1398
01:43:53,666 --> 01:43:55,126
I'm gonna die right here in your car.

1399
01:43:55,209 --> 01:43:56,377
Hey, come on, pull in.

1400
01:43:56,461 --> 01:43:58,255
- Pull in.
- Alright.

1401
01:44:05,805 --> 01:44:08,642
- Hello!
- Hi, can I take your order?

1402
01:44:08,725 --> 01:44:10,894
Yeah, and we're in a hurry, okay?

1403
01:44:10,978 --> 01:44:12,021
- Okay.
- You know, numbers are...

1404
01:44:12,104 --> 01:44:13,814
a strange thing.

1405
01:44:14,440 --> 01:44:17,151
Did you ever notice how
a number will follow you...

1406
01:44:17,235 --> 01:44:20,739
throughout your whole life
like some kind of conspiracy?

1407
01:44:23,534 --> 01:44:25,703
Did you wanna order something?

1408
01:44:26,955 --> 01:44:28,665
I'll have a...

1409
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:32,544
twenty-two cheeseburgers...

1410
01:44:33,045 --> 01:44:34,713
with everything on them.

1411
01:44:35,297 --> 01:44:36,799
Oh my.

1412
01:44:37,467 --> 01:44:39,719
- Quite a number.
- Okay.

1413
01:44:39,803 --> 01:44:42,347
Twenty-two cheeseburgers
with everything.

1414
01:44:42,431 --> 01:44:44,224
- Okay.
- Twenty-two...

1415
01:44:44,975 --> 01:44:46,853
orders of fries.

1416
01:44:47,395 --> 01:44:50,398
- Add twenty-two French fries.
- Okay.

1417
01:44:50,732 --> 01:44:52,484
Twenty-two...

1418
01:44:53,360 --> 01:44:54,653
onion rings.

1419
01:44:54,737 --> 01:44:56,739
- Twenty-two...
- Twenty-two...

1420
01:44:58,700 --> 01:45:00,910
And twenty-two onion rings.

1421
01:45:01,411 --> 01:45:03,372
Is that a real knife?
Can I touch that?

1422
01:45:03,455 --> 01:45:05,291
Yeah, sure. Just be careful
not to cut yourself.

1423
01:45:05,374 --> 01:45:09,087
Terry! No, that's not
a good idea, I don't think.

1424
01:45:11,047 --> 01:45:12,799
Hey! Have we missed the hospital?

1425
01:45:12,883 --> 01:45:14,468
I don't know. It doesn't
look familiar, does it?

1426
01:45:14,551 --> 01:45:15,594
- No.
- Did you see any more...

1427
01:45:15,678 --> 01:45:17,555
- of those blue signs?
- I don't know.

1428
01:45:17,638 --> 01:45:22,435
- Maybe we should ask somebody.
- Now, you two kids. Let's stop this.

1429
01:45:24,605 --> 01:45:26,065
Well...

1430
01:45:26,231 --> 01:45:27,441
- Bye.
- Bye.

1431
01:45:27,525 --> 01:45:29,318
Bye, tiger!

1432
01:45:29,402 --> 01:45:30,486
- Bye!
- Bye!

1433
01:45:30,570 --> 01:45:32,530
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.

1434
01:45:32,614 --> 01:45:33,740
- We miss you!
- Feel better.

1435
01:45:33,824 --> 01:45:35,701
- Keep your chin up.
- Bye!

1436
01:45:35,784 --> 01:45:37,703
Oh, gosh.

1437
01:45:37,953 --> 01:45:40,456
They'll take good care of you.

1438
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:43,293
Do you think he'll be okay?

1439
01:45:43,376 --> 01:45:45,504
Well, the attendant who
wheeled him in said as soon as...

1440
01:45:45,587 --> 01:45:47,715
they pull that thing
out of his skull...

1441
01:45:48,132 --> 01:45:49,842
he's a dead man.

1442
01:45:50,968 --> 01:45:53,555
Then, Dad, why don't they
just cut it out?

1443
01:45:53,638 --> 01:45:55,223
I don't know, honey.

1444
01:45:55,432 --> 01:45:57,893
You know, maybe they will.
Maybe they'll just...

1445
01:45:57,977 --> 01:46:01,564
go get a Sawzall and
cut that sucker off.

1446
01:46:01,689 --> 01:46:04,943
Roger, stop it. God!
I'm gonna be sick.

1447
01:46:05,026 --> 01:46:08,489
- Terry's gonna be sick.
- I am not going to be sick, Mom.

1448
01:46:12,535 --> 01:46:13,745
Shot him.

1449
01:46:14,454 --> 01:46:16,123
That's really unique.

1450
01:46:19,668 --> 01:46:21,712
Alright, here we go.

1451
01:46:21,921 --> 01:46:24,215
Thank you, Pat. Thank you.

1452
01:46:27,386 --> 01:46:28,470
Yeah...

1453
01:46:28,679 --> 01:46:30,097
Leon told me about this place.

1454
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:32,725
He used to drink coffee
here every morning.

1455
01:46:35,228 --> 01:46:36,396
Yeah.

1456
01:46:39,024 --> 01:46:40,150
What?

1457
01:46:43,279 --> 01:46:45,281
So, when are you gonna come clean?

1458
01:46:46,116 --> 01:46:47,576
Don't follow.

1459
01:46:49,286 --> 01:46:51,497
Natalie thinks you might
be her father.

1460
01:46:53,374 --> 01:46:54,625
Are you?

1461
01:47:00,132 --> 01:47:02,009
Do you really want to know?

1462
01:47:02,760 --> 01:47:04,720
Of course I do.

1463
01:47:04,846 --> 01:47:07,056
I've got nobody, Mar.

1464
01:47:07,599 --> 01:47:10,185
Do you know what it feels like
to be abandoned?

1465
01:47:10,352 --> 01:47:13,272
Every time I get close to somebody,
I just push them away...

1466
01:47:13,355 --> 01:47:15,149
cause I'm so scared that...

1467
01:47:15,233 --> 01:47:17,527
they're gonna leave me
sooner or later.

1468
01:47:17,694 --> 01:47:19,738
So, I've gotta sort it out.

1469
01:47:22,449 --> 01:47:25,453
I guess the answer is that
I don't really know.

1470
01:47:29,124 --> 01:47:31,293
Yeah, but you could take a test.

1471
01:47:32,211 --> 01:47:34,964
Yeah, I could take a test.
What's the point of that?

1472
01:47:35,339 --> 01:47:37,383
Your mother never told me
one way or another.

1473
01:47:37,467 --> 01:47:39,302
Why don't you just leave it that way?

1474
01:47:40,804 --> 01:47:42,598
What about Natalie, Marvin?

1475
01:47:42,681 --> 01:47:45,142
Don't you ever think
how she might feel?

1476
01:47:45,351 --> 01:47:48,479
Sure, I think about the way
she feels all the time.

1477
01:47:57,240 --> 01:47:58,658
Alright.

1478
01:47:59,367 --> 01:48:00,910
I got this...

1479
01:48:01,328 --> 01:48:03,413
about four years ago.

1480
01:48:11,881 --> 01:48:15,886
Dear Mar, I'm still alive.
Please don't be mad at me.

1481
01:48:15,970 --> 01:48:18,097
Take care of Natalie, if you can.

1482
01:48:18,180 --> 01:48:20,224
Don't tell her about me.

1483
01:48:20,350 --> 01:48:23,270
It's too late and
much too complicated.

1484
01:48:23,812 --> 01:48:26,440
Kiss you. Love, C.C.

1485
01:48:32,989 --> 01:48:34,199
So...

1486
01:48:36,577 --> 01:48:38,287
you go to Ecuador...

1487
01:48:40,540 --> 01:48:43,710
to the Valley of the Reclining God...

1488
01:48:44,544 --> 01:48:46,046
and you ask her.

1489
01:48:46,672 --> 01:48:48,465
She owes you an answer.

1490
01:48:49,008 --> 01:48:50,843
And she owes me an answer.

1491
01:48:53,513 --> 01:48:54,556
Jack...

1492
01:48:54,806 --> 01:48:57,977
I decided I'm not going to
build parking lots anymore.

1493
01:48:58,060 --> 01:48:59,895
I'm tired of tearing buildings down.

1494
01:48:59,979 --> 01:49:04,693
I've come to really hate
the stink of asphalt, so...

1495
01:49:05,277 --> 01:49:08,781
I've decided to invest
in your wacky scheme.

1496
01:49:08,864 --> 01:49:11,284
It can't be any worse than Leon's.

1497
01:49:11,367 --> 01:49:15,121
But just remember, you gotta
have good lighting.
