         Yeah. I don't think so.

123

What happened?

124

            Nothing.

125

      She's too busy with
      her new friends.

126
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,787
   I have too much going on,
   though, anyway.

127
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,255
Yes, you do.

128
00:11:30,257 --> 00:11:33,024
Have to get your essay
in their hands by the 15th.

129
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,826

My ticket out of
this town, thank God.

131
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:46,037
   Hey, Mom, do you think dad
   would have loved you

132
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,741
if you were like deformed

133
00:11:49,743 --> 00:11:53,078
      or had flapjacks
      or something?

134
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,746
             What?

135
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,848
I don't know.
Never mind.

136
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,383
             What would make you
             ask that, sweetie?

137
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,486
Nothing, nothing.
Just drop it.

138
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:03,221
          Of course, your father
          would have.

139
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,825
                         He did.

140
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,093
        That's why he married me

141
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:10,962
              and not that bimbo
              Judy DeZulla.

142
00:12:10,964 --> 00:12:13,398
Okay, Mom, we can't all be
as beautiful as you are.

143
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,836
        Honey, I'm sure whatever
        is going on with you and
        Angel is just a phase.

144
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,843
What's his sudden interest
in you anyway?

145
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,377
I mean, he only likes
skanks like Brooke.

146
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:28,113
               Well, I guess
               I'm a skank then.

147
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,181
            Because he likes me.
            And I like him.

148
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:31,516
      Brad?

149
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,951
I mean, come on.

150
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,285
He's such an asshole
'roid head.

151
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:36,788
               Amy, he's not!
               He's really nice.

152
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,789
          If you would just give
          him a chance...

153
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,257
No, thanks.

154
00:12:39,259 --> 00:12:40,492
I'd rather die than hang out
with those douchebags.

155
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:43,228
             Everything's always
             about you.

156
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,031
              Why can't you just
              be happy for me?

157
00:12:56,876 --> 00:12:58,409
                            Amy?

158
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,378
What?

159
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:02,480
Just drop it.

160
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,220
          ( screaming )

161
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,460
           ( laughs )

162
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,129
     - ( tires screeching )
     - ( screaming )

163
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:22,233
     Such a YouTube queen.

164
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:25,503
 I guess she is used to having
 her legs open, isn't she?

165
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,105
         Unbelievable.

166
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:34,312
              Whoo!

167
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,984
          ( shouting )

168
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,121
      - I wanna do it.
      - You wanna do what?

169
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:44,489
         I wanna ride the space.

170
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,991
            - Yeah?
            - Yeah.

171
00:13:46,993 --> 00:13:49,160
Okay.

172
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,096
      My baby's gonna
      ride the space! Whoo!

173
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,132
          Woo-hoo-hoo!

174
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,407
          Wait. What.?

175
00:14:09,582 --> 00:14:11,449
         Check it out!
         Whoo-hoo!

176
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:13,484
        - I'm doing it!
        - Whoo!

177
00:14:13,486 --> 00:14:14,853
                            Man!

178
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,159
             Stop.

179
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:24,195
                           Babe?

180
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:28,399
    - Come on, baby.
    - Look, stop! Seriously!

181
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:29,567
      Brooke, I'm driving!

182
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,969
             Guys?

183
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,638
       Easy, easy!

184
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,606
         Angel, Angel!

185
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:39,244
           Oh, shit!

186
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:42,914
No, no, no, no!

187
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:46,351
      No, no, no, no, no,
      no, no, no.

188
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,555
    No, no, no, no, no, no.

189
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,390
   You're okay, you're okay.

190
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,459
<i> 9-1-1.</i>

191
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,094
There's been an accident.

192
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:58,296
           ( crying )

193
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,101
We're gonna be in
so much trouble!

194
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:04,235
         Don't worry.
         We'll be fine.

195
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:07,171
             We? What about her?

196
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:09,040
                           Shit.

197
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:11,009
      ( ambulance siren )

198
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:12,977
About fucking time.

199
00:15:12,979 --> 00:15:14,212
    - Tim, come on, man!
    - What are we gonna say?

200
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,318
What the fuck
are you doing?

201
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,453
        Let's just say she fell.

202
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,555
How'd the fuck would she
fall out of a moving car?

203
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,324
         I don't know!

204
00:15:39,705 --> 00:15:42,340
     She was always just
     goofing off like that.

205
00:15:42,342 --> 00:15:45,243
So she climbed out
without anyone noticing?

206
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:47,645
And just fell?

207
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,380
                        I swear.

208
00:15:49,382 --> 00:15:51,149
     - Dude, what happened?
     - It was an accident.

209
00:15:51,151 --> 00:15:52,450
You! You!

210
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:54,218
          ( yelling )

211
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,587
       It wasn't anyone's fault.
       It was an accident!

212
00:15:56,589 --> 00:15:59,023
Cut the crap.

213
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,358
Breathe! Relax!

214
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,660
     What took you guys so
     long to get here?

215
00:16:02,662 --> 00:16:07,198
We got one ambulance
covering 300 square miles.

216
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,967
Do the math.

217
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,145
              Amy:
 In the past couple of months,

218
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:25,016
 Angel and I had grown apart.

219
00:16:25,018 --> 00:16:29,320
    not because we didn't
    want to see each other.

220
00:16:29,322 --> 00:16:34,092
  But because she wanted
  to try new things and grow.

221
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:35,360
Your hair looks so good.

222
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,728
             I know, right?

223
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,696
     The guy who does hair
     in Top Model did it.

224
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:39,697
He's really good.

225
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:41,466
                 Unreal.

226
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:44,535
  I'll remember her for
  the free spirit that she was

227
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:48,272
and how she taught me
the meaning of friendship.

228
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,141
        - Shut up!
        - It's awesome.

229
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:52,410
             It's a funeral,
             not a fashion show.

230
00:16:53,645 --> 00:16:57,048
I love you, Angel.

231
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:59,150
I'm gonna miss you so much.

232
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:01,586
( giggles )

233
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,354
You're so bad.

234
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,125
That was beautiful.

235
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:10,328
All right now. I'm going
to get you out of here.

236
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:13,798
But first, a few words about
automobile safety

237
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,267
from Sergeant Higgins.

238
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,202
          I feel sick.

239
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,038
  That's because you're drinking
  at 10:30 in the morning.

240
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,773
                        Shut up!

241
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,175
Thank you,
Principal Stockton.

242
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:28,312
   Obviously, not my
   favorite part of the job.

243
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:32,517
      Statistics show
      that vehicle crashes

244
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:36,054
   are the number one cause
   of death in this country.

245
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,655
   So I know you're out
   there having a good time.

246
00:17:37,657 --> 00:17:39,257
      And you're texting.
      And you're jamming.

247
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:40,358
       And you're rockin'
       out to the radio.

248
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,559
        But let me tell
        you something,

249
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:43,428
    by the time I get there,
    the fun is over

250
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,163
       and what I see is
       not so pretty.

251
00:17:45,165 --> 00:17:49,067
    So could you please just
    keep in mind, please,

252
00:17:49,069 --> 00:17:52,503
       that a car is not

253
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,205
             a toy.

254
00:17:59,711 --> 00:18:02,613
Hey, good job in there.

255
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,182
It was really nice.

256
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:06,284
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:08,486
                         Thanks.

258
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,359
Hey, Mary.

259
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:16,761
Hey, Amy.

260
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:20,865
I just wanted to personally
give you my condolences.

261
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:24,402
Those kids friends
of yours too?

262
00:18:24,404 --> 00:18:25,837
                  Not at all.

263
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:27,772
That's good because I think
Angel would have fared

264
00:18:27,774 --> 00:18:29,640
a little bit better if
she hadn't been friends
with them either.

265
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,243
 Do you suspect that there
 is more to their story than...

266
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,678
Following up on
a couple of things.

267
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,382
We're gonna go.

268
00:18:38,384 --> 00:18:42,420
             Right.

269
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:45,189
        - See you soon.
        - Yeah.

270
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:48,826
Oh, and, Amy, you need
anything, don't hesitate
to call day or night, okay?

271
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:54,799
I always promised your
father I'd watch after you.

272
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,135
He would have done
the same for me.

273
00:18:57,137 --> 00:18:58,736
                 Well, I'm fine.

274
00:18:58,738 --> 00:19:00,338
Okay.

275
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,418
           ( crying )

276
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,364

287
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:42,573
                    God damn it!

288
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,875
           Why does nothing work
           in this office?

289
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,444
What's the problem?

290
00:20:46,446 --> 00:20:47,778
                   Stupid mouse.

291
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,714
            The mouse is stupid.

292
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:52,650
 Listen, by the way,
 there's this kid, Jordan Banks.

293
00:20:52,652 --> 00:20:54,385
            He went away
            for the weekend

294
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,287
             and didn't check in
             with his mommy yet.

295
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,955
Big surprise there.

296
00:20:57,957 --> 00:21:00,625
  His mom's been up my dick hole
  like a goddamned kangaroo.

297
00:21:00,627 --> 00:21:03,661
Sounds painful.

298
00:21:03,663 --> 00:21:05,563
             It is.

299
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:12,503
      I just don't get guys.
      I think they're all jerks.

300
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,972
         Some are, kid.

301
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,440
          ( chuckles )

302
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:18,276
Not all of them.

303
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:20,578
         You got home late again
         last night.

304
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,414
Mm-hmm.

305
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:26,584
      You and your new boyfriend
      must be having quite
      the time together.

306
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,753
Archie's not
my boyfriend.

307
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,055
But thank you for asking.

308
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,958
          So do we have step dad
          material here or what?

309
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,728
What are you doing?

310
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:39,497
          I'm sorry. I'm just...

311
00:21:44,903 --> 00:21:47,972
                     I miss Dad.

312
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,741
I know.

313
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:52,543
Me too.

314
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,850
And now with Angel,

315
00:21:59,852 --> 00:22:02,653
I can't imagine.

316
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,528
    You know what I was thinking
    about the other day?

317
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,430
What?

318
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:15,766
              Do you remember
              the July 4th Fair?

319
00:22:15,768 --> 00:22:17,468
Of course.

320
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:19,036
        - The fireworks?
        - The fireworks.

321
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,538
          ( laughing )

322
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:24,075
              They were so low
              and I was so lost.

323
00:22:24,077 --> 00:22:27,011
Daddy jumped on you
like you were on fire.

324
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,021
            I just don't get
            what he sees in her.

325
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:38,723
Who?

326
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,492
                          Jason.

327
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,667
               Okay, if you like
               him so much,

328
00:22:49,669 --> 00:22:51,469
              why don't you just
              ask him to chill?

329
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,437
Chill, Mom?

330
00:22:53,439 --> 00:22:54,939
        What? I can't say chill?

331
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,808
No, you can.

332
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,110
It's just...

333
00:22:59,112 --> 00:23:03,414
I just, um, I wanted
to run something by you.

334
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:05,383
      - Okay.
      - ( doorbell rings )

335
00:23:05,385 --> 00:23:07,051
              Hold that thought.

336
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,821
I think I want a boob job.

337
00:23:12,157 --> 00:23:14,458
          A boob job?

338
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,461
I thought you were doing so
well with your jazzercise tapes.

339
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:20,131
It's cardio kickboxing, Mom.
And it's not enough.

340
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,834
      But, baby, you're so
      beautiful the way you are.

341
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,636
Can't we at least
talk to Dr. Monroe?

342
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,171
           We'll talk about this
           in a bit, okay?

343
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,873
       ( doorbell rings )

344
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,909
             Phil?

345
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,978
Hi. Come on in.

346
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,979
                         Thanks.

347
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:36,814
What brings you by?

348
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:40,418
    Well, actually, I wanted
    to talk to Amy.

349
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:45,990
             So what do you know
             about Jordan Banks?

350
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:48,926
That he's
a walking STD?

351
00:23:48,928 --> 00:23:50,060
              Amy!

352
00:23:50,062 --> 00:23:51,862
                    ( chuckles )
                    All right.

353
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:53,164
     Any idea where he might be?

354
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,599
    No, not a clue.

355
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:56,967
        Why do you ask?

356
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:59,503
     Well, his folks filed
     a missing persons.

357
00:23:59,505 --> 00:24:02,706
      And I didn't know if there
      was any word on the street
      as to his whereabouts.

358
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:06,010
                Hopefully, well,

359
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,778
      hopefully, there's nothing
      to be concerned about.

360
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,114
We are hardly concerned.

361
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:13,751
        Amy, what has
        gotten into you?

362
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:20,524
I can't stop
thinking about Angel.

363
00:24:20,526 --> 00:24:22,726
          Well, stop.

364
00:24:22,728 --> 00:24:23,928
What if somebody
finds out?

365
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,029
We could be in deep shit.

366
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:27,231
  Oh, the dead don't speak, J.

367
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,700
          Let it die.
          They did.

368
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,168
How do you sleep at night?

369
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,636
             Naked.

370
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:34,638
What is wrong with you?

371
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,740
    What's wrong with me is
    that you're acting like
    a little bitch.

372
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:39,210
        Brooke, this is serious.

373
00:24:39,212 --> 00:24:43,180
    I'm sure your little friend,
    Amy, would love to know
    how serious it is.

374
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,949
                Are you kidding?

375
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:46,050
               You can't
               just threaten me.

376
00:24:46,052 --> 00:24:47,551
            Oh, no?

377
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,853
It's not your place
to tell her anything.

378
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:50,988
      I can do whatever
      I want to do, okay?

379
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:54,258
I'm laying here being
all hot and stuff.

380
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,062
And you're over there whining
about all this bullshit!

381
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:00,097
    No, Brooke. I'm just sick
    of playing this game.

382
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:02,533
          ( sighs )
          I gotta go.

383
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:05,736
         I'm gonna have to touch
         myself since you can't
         seem to handle it.

384
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,072
      - You're the Devil.
      - Bye, little bitch!

385
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:26,557
Is that what
you're gonna wear?

386
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,294
              No.

387
00:25:30,296 --> 00:25:33,297
Maybe just something you just
slip easily on and off, yeah?

388
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:37,167
 <i> ¶ This love was never easy ¶</i>

391
00:25:43,809 --> 00:25:48,078
Amy, you look to be a
perfect candidate for
breast augmentation.

392
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,146
             Great.

393
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:50,814
          Thank you, Dr. Monroe.

394
00:25:50,816 --> 00:25:53,817
Now, Mary, you know
you can call me Dennis.

395
00:25:53,819 --> 00:25:56,153
                      Of course.

396
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,888
You can call me
anything you want.

397
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,990
Just don't call me
late for supper.

398
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,293
( chuckles )

399
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:04,728
So how soon can we schedule?

400
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,864
Oh, let me see.

401
00:26:06,866 --> 00:26:10,167
Looks like I have a
cancellation on the 15th.

402
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,635
Does that work?

403
00:26:11,637 --> 00:26:13,170
                       That's...

404
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,339
       Yes, I'll take it.

405
00:26:15,341 --> 00:26:17,074
                           Soon.

410

Your hair looks awesome.

411
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,971
       Thanks. Didn't want it to
       be too obvious.

412
00:26:46,973 --> 00:26:48,806
God, no,
it's totally subtle.

413
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,676
What's Jason wearing
to the party?

414
00:26:52,678 --> 00:26:54,244
       Oh, if I even invite him.

415
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:55,779
Really?

416
00:26:55,781 --> 00:26:57,348
I guess Jordan's not
gonna be there either.

417
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,949
Now that he's missing.

418
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,050
          ( chuckles )

419
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:01,385
      Ugh, guys are so annoying.

420
00:27:01,387 --> 00:27:03,120
So are their mothers.

421
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:05,289
She will not stop
calling me.

422
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,857
              Zip it up, chatty.

423
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,326
I am.

424
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,797
I think it's about time
that I hang out with Brad.

425
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,333
I think he's perfection.

426
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,335
               He's kind of gay.

427
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:21,739
He's not gay.
It was a rumor.

428
00:27:21,741 --> 00:27:23,807
         I started it.

429
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,843
Oh!

430
00:27:25,845 --> 00:27:27,011
He's not gay.

431
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,278
        I'm sure you would know.

432
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,247
Not yet.

433
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,750
             Skank.

434
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,885

438
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:55,773
Hey, Jason.

439
00:27:55,775 --> 00:27:56,974
          How are you?

440
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,275
                       I'm okay.

441
00:27:58,277 --> 00:27:59,943
              Man:
       What's up, Jason?

442
00:27:59,945 --> 00:28:04,048
                So are you going
                to Brooke's?

443
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:07,317
Yeah. Something
I gotta take care of.

444
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,386
                       Is there?

445
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:11,989
Only one way to find out.

446
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:14,992
Come with me.

447
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,061

 with some of that young meat.

00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:51,955
                            Hey!

463
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:56,026
     I think he took that chick,
     Sam, to the Golden Gears
     Muscle Car Extravaganza!

464
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,463
Wait? That little jailbait slut
from the pizza place?

465
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,231
   - Yeah.
   - She's like 15 years old.

466
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:03,901
                Oh, but have you
                seen that ass?

467
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:05,269
      Gross, Spaz, gross.

468
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:07,938
Excuse me?
She's a nobody.

469
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,940
        She's a nobody.

470
00:30:15,113 --> 00:30:17,514
Ow, why do you
keep doing that?

471
00:30:17,516 --> 00:30:19,283
              See?

472
00:30:19,285 --> 00:30:21,084
       It'll be fine, I promise.

473
00:30:21,086 --> 00:30:22,186
                Let me go get us
                some drinks.

474
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:25,322
Hey, Red Riding Hood.
You lost?

475
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:27,157
     I think I'm gonna go.

476
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:29,259
     - You guys talking
       about me over here?
     - No.

477
00:30:29,261 --> 00:30:30,494
       Oh, this should be
       a train wreck.

478
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:33,363
            Then maybe you were
            talking about Angel.

479
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,199
             And her "accident".

480
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,534
      - Brooke...
      - Oh, that's right.

481
00:30:37,536 --> 00:30:40,270
               The loser sisters
               were friends.

482
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,271
Yeah. Let's go.

483
00:30:41,273 --> 00:30:42,539
Hey, where you going?

484
00:30:42,541 --> 00:30:44,508
  Yeah, well, not here.
  Later, J.

485
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,877
 What do you mean, "accident"?

486
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:49,279
    Don't put your fingers
    where they don't belong.

487
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,914
     - You might lose them.
     - What?

488
00:30:50,916 --> 00:30:52,883
Brooke, stop!
You're drunk!

489
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:54,551
The bitch thing is getting
kind of old, all right?

490
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,053
       It's not the 80s anymore.

491
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,922
    Go drive your scooter
    into a tree and film it!

492
00:30:58,924 --> 00:31:01,491
     Nobody would care,
     especially not Rachel!

493
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:04,528
     And you, Mr. Innocent.

494
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:05,996
            Don't act like Angel
            was your first.

495
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:08,365
     What?

496
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:11,301
  Tell me you and Jordan didn't
  leave that little old lady
  for dead in the woods.

497
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,121
          ( screams )

498
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:06,290
Oh, shit!

499
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:12,930
          Oh, my God!

500
00:32:12,932 --> 00:32:14,064
         What'll we do?

501
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:15,132
            I'm getting
            the hell outta here.

502
00:32:15,134 --> 00:32:16,533
We have to wait
for the police!

503
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,468
        - Fuck that!
        - We can't just
        leave her here!

504
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:21,305
 You wanna do five to ten for
 manslaughter, be my guest, pal!

505
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,940
      - Not me!
      - He's right, Jason.

506
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:24,174
                Look, she's old.

507
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,542
                She probably had
                a good life.

508
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,511
            We can't go to jail!
            Come on, let's go!

509
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:29,579
Shit!

510
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:05,415
                     Is it true?

511
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,517
              Baby, you better
              believe it's true.

512
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:11,421
      He's a real piece of shit.
      Just like the rest of us.

513
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,056
      I can't believe it.

514
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:15,392
      Why? 'Cause you loved him?

515
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:18,628
           ( crying )

516
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,198
Hey.

517
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,699
Fuck, Brooke!

518
00:33:22,701 --> 00:33:24,267
            - What?
            - What?

519
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:28,238
You're gonna get us all
arrested for starters!

520
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,073
What is wrong with you?

521
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:32,142
                        Anyways.

522
00:33:34,445 --> 00:33:36,380
Brad, it's Tim.

523
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:39,249
Brooke has lost
her shit, okay?

524
00:33:39,251 --> 00:33:43,787
She's just spewing words
in front of everybody.

525
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,089
Chaos. Call me back.

526
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,640
( cell phone rings )

527
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:08,378
Are you gonna get that?

528
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:10,580
                 Just ignore it.

529
00:34:10,582 --> 00:34:13,083
                    You want me?

530
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:15,052
You know I do.

531
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,586
              You think I'm hot?

532
00:34:16,588 --> 00:34:19,322
Yeah.

533
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:20,657
                Tell me I'm hot.

534
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,460
You're so fucking hot.

535
00:34:25,663 --> 00:34:27,798
        Am I hotter than Brooke?

536
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,167
Yeah, you're so hot.

537
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:33,170
         Yeah, but tell me
         I'm hotter than Brooke.

538
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:34,371
You're hotter than Brooke.

539
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,139
             Yeah?

540
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,282
                  ( clattering )

541
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:47,684
             Wait!

542
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:50,754
         What was that?

543
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:52,422
I don't hear anything.

544
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,723
        Brad, seriously.

545
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,459
What?

546
00:34:55,461 --> 00:34:57,160
           Just look.

547
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,462
I'm looking.

548
00:34:58,464 --> 00:35:00,497
Yeah, I don't
see anything.

549
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:03,166
Babe, don't worry.

550
00:35:03,168 --> 00:35:05,469
I'll protect you.

551
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:19,649
She shouldn't have been
running her mouth where
she doesn't belong.

552
00:35:19,651 --> 00:35:21,251
How dare you bring
her here, by the way!

553
00:35:21,253 --> 00:35:22,786
                     She's nice!

554
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:24,588
    Maybe you'd realize that if
    you could get over yourself!

555
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,894
               No wonder your
               parents hate you.

556
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,829
Get the fuck out
of my house!

557
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,431
And don't come back till
you're ready to treat me

558
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:37,300
the way I deserve
to be treated!

559
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:39,669
      I do treat you the way
      you deserve to be treated.

560
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,521
                 It's so fucking
                 hot in here.

561
00:35:57,523 --> 00:35:58,755
            I'm ready to go now.

562
00:35:58,757 --> 00:36:00,290
Okay.

563
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Oh, fuck.

564
00:36:03,362 --> 00:36:04,794
          ( chuckles )

565
00:36:04,796 --> 00:36:05,829
                     ( screams )

566
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:07,297
            Rachel?

567
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,666
            Rachel?
            Rachel!

568
00:36:13,371 --> 00:36:15,238
          ( yelling )

569
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,441
         - Bitch!
         - ( whirring )

570
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:20,410
            Rachel!

571
00:36:43,401 --> 00:36:44,701
      Guys?

572
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:53,276
             Guys?

573
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,848
           Oh, shit.

574
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,753
            Rachel?

575
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:07,490
             Brad?

576
00:37:21,439 --> 00:37:22,939
             Brad?

577
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:26,309
( clattering )

578
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,748
            Rachel?

579
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,686
Rachel?

580
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,678
          ( exhaling )

581
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,755
         Damn it, boys.

582
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,991
      What have you gotten
      yourselves into now?

583
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:50,560
           ( crying )

584
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:03,506
    I told you not to go messing
    around out there, didn't I?

585
00:39:03,508 --> 00:39:04,941
Please don't!

586
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:07,977
It's not even that bad!

587
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:09,079
( crying )

588
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,647
                        Shut up.

589
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,095
     ( muffled screaming )

590
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,835
  You're an animal!

591
00:39:31,837 --> 00:39:33,670
                     Mama's boy.

592
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:36,906
           ( crying )

593
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:08,191
     ( gasps ) Oh, my God!

594
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:14,831
             Shit!

595
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:27,744
          ( screams )

596
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,318
   - Man:<i> Dispatch for 113. </i>
   - Man #2:<i> Go for 113.</i>

597
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,888
<i> Abandoned vehicle found</i>
<i> on Ash Pine Road by</i>
<i> the scrap yard.</i>

598
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:40,957
               <i> Yeah. On my way.</i>

599
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,219
          ( banging )

600
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,224
         What's all the banging?
         We're fuckin' closed!

601
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:18,027
I wanna take a look around.

602
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,363
Got a call about
a missing car

603
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:22,332
and some missing kids.
You seen anything?

604
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:25,969
       Once they're behind
       this gate, it's too late.

605
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:29,005
        For the wrecks, that is.

606
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:30,640
Yeah, yeah.
Just open up.

607
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:32,041
              Yes, sir, Officer.

608
00:43:40,184 --> 00:43:41,884
                     Come on in.

609
00:43:48,892 --> 00:43:50,860
       Have any visitors
       last night?

610
00:43:50,862 --> 00:43:53,296
                           Nope.

611
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:58,368
Pretty early to be
working, isn't it?

612
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:00,837
          Cars ain't gonna crush
          themselves.

613
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:03,172
No. No, I guess
they wouldn't.

614
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:07,110

             Guess he missed
             the smell of blood.

620

           Now I'm gonna fix
           those teeth of yours.

649
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:39,328

            Honey, remember what
            the doctor said.

653
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:39,856
        No food or drink for
        24 hours before surgery.

654
00:47:39,858 --> 00:47:41,457
      Mom, I know,
      but my throat is so dry.

655
00:47:41,459 --> 00:47:42,859
         Just one sip.

             isn't it?

658
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:56,939
Well, they probably got
what they deserved.

00:47:56,941 --> 00:47:58,608
                All righty then.

660
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,115
   Well, tomorrow's the big day.

Yeah, I guess so.

663
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:14,257
But I had the worst
nightmare about it last night.

664
00:48:14,259 --> 00:48:17,593

     like going through with it,
     we can always reschedule.

     Well, all I know is that if
     I could do it, anyone can.

762
00:54:05,843 --> 00:54:07,876
          Before, I had nothing.

763
00:54:07,878 --> 00:54:12,815
      And now I have a
      super cute boyfriend
      who drives an amazing car.

764
00:54:12,817 --> 00:54:17,720
And you didn't remember to
send in your essay, did you?

765
00:54:20,457 --> 00:54:22,424
              No.

766
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:26,462
Well, I guess some things
are just more important
to different people.

767
00:54:26,464 --> 00:54:28,530
              Why can't you just
              be happy for me?

768
00:54:28,532 --> 00:54:31,367
I am, but I need you to be
able to deal with the fact

769
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:35,004
that I'm friends
with other men.

770
00:54:35,006 --> 00:54:38,641
      ( knocking on door )

771
00:54:38,643 --> 00:54:40,542
Speak of the devil.

772
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:47,683
Come on in.

773
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:49,318
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

774
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:53,822
So, Amy, this is Darryl.

775
00:54:53,824 --> 00:54:56,425
Darryl, this is my daughter,

776
00:54:56,427 --> 00:54:59,628
Amy, who I've been
telling you so much about.

777
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:01,630
Hey.

778
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,734
So, where'd you guys meet?

779
00:55:05,736 --> 00:55:07,903
( voice fades )

780
00:55:34,397 --> 00:55:36,899
Mom, what's wrong with him?

781
00:55:36,901 --> 00:55:38,567
              Amy!

782
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,569
      You look awfully familiar.

783
00:55:40,571 --> 00:55:43,439
( car honks )

784
00:55:43,441 --> 00:55:47,343
That's Jason.
I'll see you later.

785
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,853
                        Mom?

786
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,788
              Mom!

787
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,125
Darryl: Jon Roy!

788
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:39,962
           ( crying )

789
00:57:11,728 --> 00:57:14,830
    <i> ( music over dialogue )</i>

790
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:33,549
Darryl, where did you go?

791
00:57:44,227 --> 00:57:47,463
      Come on. There's something
      I want to show you.

792
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:02,010
      So what schools are
      you looking at?

793
00:58:02,012 --> 00:58:05,013
     Um, I was actually thinking
     I was taking a year off.

794
00:58:05,015 --> 00:58:06,782
            Really?

795
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,484
                     Yeah.

796
00:58:08,486 --> 00:58:10,219
                  Yeah, fuck it.

797
00:58:10,221 --> 00:58:12,955
 I mean, I don't want to be tied
 down to school and schedules

798
00:58:12,957 --> 00:58:16,091
          and professors
          telling me what to do.

799
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:19,995
           You know, I just want
           to drink beer.

800
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:21,630
          ( chuckles )

801
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,198
            - Whoa!
            - Shit!

802
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,801
     God, these shoes were $300.

803
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:29,004
           You'd think that
           I could walk in them.

804
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,205
                           What?

805
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,275
Where is Amy?
Is she in there?

806
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:36,812
                       I'm here.

807
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:38,213
                I'm just better.

808
00:58:38,215 --> 00:58:40,816
I thought you were
better before.

809
00:58:40,818 --> 00:58:44,887
I mean, you're beautiful.

810
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:46,855
                       But?

811
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,258
But you're acting
like an ass.

812
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:52,261
                  What? I mean..

813
00:58:52,263 --> 00:58:54,930
             I thought that this
             is what you wanted.

814
00:58:54,932 --> 00:58:58,300
You thought I cared
how much your shoes cost?

815
00:58:58,302 --> 00:59:02,104
     Okay, I guess I was
     just trying to impress you.

816
00:59:02,106 --> 00:59:04,973
All right. Maybe just
don't try so hard.

817
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:08,744
And besides,
I'm a sneaker guy.

818
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:21,323
Come on. Let's go get
you that beer.

819
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:30,999
Man:
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

820
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:35,237
Hey, that search warrant
you requested was denied.

821
00:59:35,239 --> 00:59:36,772
                         Really?

822
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:39,641
Guess the judge
thought better of it.

823
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:44,913
           We'll see about that.

824
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:55,757
              Man: You piece
              of shit! Fuck you!

825
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:59,194
     What's going on here?

826
00:59:59,196 --> 01:00:01,897
    I don't know.
    Hope everything's okay.

827
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,800
                 You big retard!

828
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:07,302
What is going on in there?

829
01:00:13,142 --> 01:00:15,143
         ( screaming )

830
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:20,849
        ( Amy shrieks )

831
01:00:29,892 --> 01:00:31,159
         ( screaming )

832
01:00:33,196 --> 01:00:35,063
             Jason!

833
01:00:35,065 --> 01:00:36,732
              Run!

834
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,773
      Hey, let's play
      where's Amy's mommy!

835
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:19,675
   Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

836
01:01:22,278 --> 01:01:24,813
   Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

837
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,824
          ( tapping )

838
01:01:35,826 --> 01:01:37,726
              Amy?

839
01:01:41,164 --> 01:01:43,465
Nobody's gonna help you, Amy.

840
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:04,252
Bunch of self-entitled maggots!

841
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,288
No common decency!

842
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,295
       No consideration!

843
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,406
You killed my mother,
you fuckin' bitch!

844
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:29,111
Look, I just wanna talk.

845
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:34,950
I'm not gonna hurt you.

846
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:39,454
You don't have to hide.

847
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,760
Gotta learn respect!

848
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:47,462
Back in my day, we had manners!

849
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:48,430
           ( grunts )

850
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,514
              Mom?

851
01:03:45,555 --> 01:03:47,923
              No!

852
01:04:04,874 --> 01:04:07,075
           ( crying )

853
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,044
              Mom.

854
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:18,520
              Mom.

855
01:04:22,458 --> 01:04:24,326
          ( screams )

856
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:52,320
          ( shouting )

857
01:04:52,322 --> 01:04:54,923
           Start working on
           those fuckin' floors!

858
01:04:54,925 --> 01:04:57,359
             Why don't you do
            some fuckin' dishes?

859
01:04:57,361 --> 01:04:59,027
               Shut the fuck up!

860
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:02,397
        All you do is sit around

861
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:05,567
       and praise fuckin' Jesus!

862
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:08,603
          ( continues shouting )

863
01:05:12,275 --> 01:05:13,508
              You piece of shit!

864
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,644
                       Fuck you!
                       Fuck you!

865
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:23,585
        Don't hurt him.

866
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:27,088
 He was only tryin' to help me.

867
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:31,459
Wait'll I get my goddamn
hands on you again!

868
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:34,262
        When I was away, I read
        a lot of books, old man.

869
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:35,630
         A lot of fuckin' books!

870
01:05:35,632 --> 01:05:37,432
    You can't fuckin' read!

871
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:39,301
         Oh, yeah?
         You know what I can do?

872
01:05:39,303 --> 01:05:43,071
I can give you a transorbital
fuckin' lobotomy if I wanted to!

873
01:05:43,073 --> 01:05:44,940
      - You piece of shit!
      - ( whirring )

874
01:05:44,942 --> 01:05:46,675
( screaming )

875
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,452
               God bless us all!

876
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:11,299
Darryl: Jon Roy!

877
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,588
       I'm gonna cut you
     so deep your mother's

878
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,091
     gonna feel it in hell,
       you little bitch!

879
01:06:46,035 --> 01:06:49,537
             Hello?

880
01:06:49,539 --> 01:06:51,272
         Somebody here?

881
01:07:19,168 --> 01:07:22,504
                     ( screams )

882
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:47,562
               ( Amy screaming )

883
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:50,598
              Help me, somebody,
              please!

884
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,605
Hung, it's Higgins.

885
01:07:57,607 --> 01:07:59,441
Listen, I'm down here
at Jimmy's Scrap Yard.

886
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:01,576
Send any available units
down here right now, okay?

887
01:08:01,578 --> 01:08:03,244
Immediately.

888
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,712
         Where is she?

889
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:06,414
                 ( Amy screams )

890
01:08:13,556 --> 01:08:16,157
                            Amy?

891
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:20,829
      Here, kitty, kitty.

892
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,698
           ( gasps )

893
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:07,802
            Brooke?

894
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:13,208
( footsteps )

895
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:19,214
Come on, Amy.

896
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:22,550
         Come to Daddy.

897
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:28,323
        Brooke, come on.
        We have to go.

898
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:30,858
           I... I...

899
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:33,394
    Brooke, please, come on!

900
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,396
      Please, we have
      to get out of here!

901
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,498
Jon Roy!

902
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:38,766
  Jon Roy!

903
01:10:43,839 --> 01:10:45,607
       ( engine starts )

904
01:11:12,801 --> 01:11:14,702
                       Hello?

905
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:39,460
         ( whimpering )

906
01:11:44,333 --> 01:11:45,933
                   Help me.

907
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,671
           ( grunts )

908
01:11:56,679 --> 01:11:58,413
           ( crying )

909
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,762
        I'm gonna turn
        you inside out.

910
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:38,419
           ( grunts )

911
01:12:39,755 --> 01:12:41,522
          ( screams )

912
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:56,738
       No! Get off of me!

913
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,539
        Leave me alone!

914
01:12:58,541 --> 01:13:00,108
They coddle you.

915
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:02,377
Driving around in fancy cars

916
01:13:02,379 --> 01:13:06,147
