00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,489
At the end of the 19th century,
the West's growing interest in China...

2
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:28,493
threatened the cultural traditions
of the Qing Dynasty.

3
00:00:30,096 --> 00:00:32,963
The following was inspired
by the true story of a Westerner...

4
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:35,001
who journeyed to China in 1902.

5
00:02:11,998 --> 00:02:14,796
Father, may I have
my photo taken too?

6
00:02:16,169 --> 00:02:17,727
We will see.

7
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,391
We must catch the light.

8
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:43,622
Open all the shades.

9
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,325
What do we need photographs for?

10
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,369
We know what we look like.

11
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,461
I know an actor
who posed for a photograph...

12
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:56,168
and the camera stole his soul.

13
00:02:56,242 --> 00:02:57,971
He never performed again.

14
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,847
Protect the camera.

15
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,658
Chang, how could you put
the reflector there?

16
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:18,561
What kind of lighting is this?

17
00:03:18,631 --> 00:03:21,691
Has anyone seen Liu?
Has anyone seen Liu?

18
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:23,702
I'll find him.

19
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:26,705
Come back here, Fu Guan!

20
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:31,341
Don't just stand there!
Wait.

21
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,345
Clean this up.
I'll find him myself.

22
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:12,583
" Pho-no-graph."

23
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,514
Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

24
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:44,311
I've got precious cargo here!

25
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,925
Liu! Father's been looking for you
everywhere! You're in trouble!

26
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,666
What's that?

27
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:03,326
Come and see.

28
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,908
Close your eyes.

29
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:20,641
He's so happy. He must have
stuffed himself with sweets.

30
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,654
Put me in the box too!

31
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:27,015
Where have you been?

32
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:29,288
We're losing the light.

33
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,296
What are you doing in here?

34
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,440
Master Ren, look.

35
00:05:51,317 --> 00:05:54,184
When I crank this,
sounds are produced.

36
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:59,086
Think of the customer's face when
he hears this. Imagine the portraits!

37
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:01,823
Liu, that's enough.

38
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,828
You've gone too far!

39
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,359
Do you know how many people
want your job?

40
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:13,169
Last week,
it was the wind machine.

41
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,173
Now it's this noisy contraption.

42
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,844
Liu, if you can't be serious,
I'm going to have to--

43
00:06:22,115 --> 00:06:23,377
Master!

44
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:27,215
Lord Tan has arrived.

45
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,220
Hurry up, then.

46
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,424
Welcome, Lord Tan!

47
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:44,367
Look! That's Lord Tan!

48
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:47,133
Lord Tan!

49
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,198
I've never seen him up close!

50
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,474
Stop, stop! Stop!

51
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,220
Welcome, Lord Tan!

52
00:07:09,328 --> 00:07:11,262
Please, come this way.

53
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:27,912
Keep an eye on my stuff.

54
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:44,487
I hope you had a pleasant journey,
Lord Tan.

55
00:07:57,844 --> 00:08:01,746
We are most honored to welcome you
to Feng Tai Photo Studio.

56
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,816
Are you ready to begin?

57
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,116
Your Lordship.

58
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,420
Play something.

59
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,695
May I introduce Liu,
our chief photographer.

60
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:45,723
Opera. Opera.

61
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:04,601
I admit, these Western tunes
have some merit, but on the whole...

62
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:06,907
I find their music
ostentatious and...

63
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:10,875
lacking in the refinements...

64
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,145
of our tradition.

65
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,254
Sing us a song!

66
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:40,504
Are you the, uh--

67
00:10:40,573 --> 00:10:42,336
Are you the proprietor?

68
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:45,536
Who are you?
What do you want?

69
00:10:46,612 --> 00:10:48,603
We're the same.

70
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:53,516
My-My name is Raymond Wallace.
Raymond Wallace.

71
00:10:54,553 --> 00:10:56,885
- Sir, good day.
- What is your business here?

72
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,550
My business-- The same.

73
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,651
Better.

74
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:06,022
My pictures...

75
00:11:06,098 --> 00:11:07,861
they move.

76
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:19,007
Living photographs that move.

77
00:11:19,078 --> 00:11:22,411
- It's a worldwide phenomenon.
- Be gone!

78
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:27,310
- Hello.
- You speak English.

79
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:30,378
- Hello.
- You speak English.

80
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:32,617
A little.

81
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:36,184
Speak Chinese better.

82
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,423
Yeah. He understands.

83
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:54,606
Please leave my studio.

84
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:59,076
No, wait, wait.
You don't understand.

85
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:12,261
Lord Tan, sorry for the disruption.
Please, come this way.

86
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:32,247
What are you doing?
Don't touch me.

87
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:50,802
Pull back the shades!

88
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,971
Good! That's it!

89
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:57,471
Who is that?

90
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:59,568
An employee named Liu.

91
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,854
Lord Tan...

92
00:13:09,922 --> 00:13:11,583
please forgive me.

93
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:13,488
Would you lift your head a little...

94
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,618
when you pose?

95
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,897
Perfect! That's it!

96
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:27,166
Let's try it now with music.

97
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:32,306
You two, start playing.

98
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,901
Keep an eye on my stuff.

99
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:03,867
My dearest Claire, I do miss you...

100
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:08,339
and I miss our children more than
these feeble words can convey.

101
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:14,440
I will be able to earn more here
than my creditors back home desire.

102
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:15,878
And Claire...

103
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:18,007
there will be yet more to come.

104
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,746
As I've told you many times...

105
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,754
my fortunes are on the rise.

106
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:28,354
I remain your loving husband,
Raymond.

107
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:47,779
There's always something new
in Lord Tan's performances!

108
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,815
At my age, there's nothing new.

109
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:58,849
I 'm surprised to see you here.

110
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,852
Well, I-I just--

111
00:17:08,794 --> 00:17:12,059
You dropped your fan at Feng Tai.

112
00:17:12,131 --> 00:17:15,328
- I came to return it.
- That's very kind of you.

113
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:28,569
Ling, you are expected backstage!

114
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,239
I'm coming!

115
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,853
Come again, if you like.

116
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,854
Thank you. I will.

117
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:42,727
Keep it for me for now.

118
00:17:57,976 --> 00:18:01,207
Ladies and gentlemen!

119
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,043
Direct from Paris!

120
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,285
Moving pictures!

121
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:11,813
Only five coins.

122
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,825
Another crazy contraption
from the West.

123
00:18:14,893 --> 00:18:17,327
Step on up!
Be the first person in Peking...

124
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,591
to witness this amazing
new invention.

125
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,064
Come on, sir.

126
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:24,595
You, ma'am, come and see.
Only five--

127
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,298
You, sir, come and see
a new invention.

128
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:30,170
- Hello.
- You speak English.

129
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,641
You remember me?

130
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:35,407
I remember you
from the photo shop.

131
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,813
Yeah, that's right.
Please, just go away.

132
00:18:37,883 --> 00:18:40,147
You, sir, step on up.

133
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,278
Step on up.
Be the first person--

134
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,651
I friend.

135
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,587
Look, please, I don't want
any trouble.

136
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:49,616
Please, just go away, okay?
Go away. Yes? Thank you.

137
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,255
You, sir, step on up.
Come on.

138
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,061
You wanna be the first person
to see Yin Shing?

139
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,466
A new invention.

140
00:18:57,536 --> 00:19:00,130
You, sir.
Only five coins.

141
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,670
You, sir.
You, sir.

142
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,955
You tell truth?
Picture move?

143
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:25,054
You want to see?
Yeah. You wanna see?

144
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,155
All right.

145
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:29,029
Five. Five.

146
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:32,903
Yeah, five.

147
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:40,303
Oh, God.
You don't have the money.

148
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:43,212
Come on. On your way.
Come on.

149
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,451
I'm not a charity.
Come on. On your way.

150
00:19:49,121 --> 00:19:50,247
Move.

151
00:19:50,322 --> 00:19:52,950
You don't want to show me.

152
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,585
Picture can't move.

153
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:59,995
-Just brag.
- Eh?

154
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:03,058
Just brag.

155
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:07,200
I don't believe it.

156
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:10,764
How can picture move?
Must be lie.

157
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,572
Are you calling me a liar?

158
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:15,704
- Are you calling me a liar?
- Liar.

159
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,520
All right, you come with me.

160
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:22,721
Through these doors.

161
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,313
Through these doors.

162
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,983
Yep, through there.
Through there. Come on.

163
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,926
In you come.
Sit there.

164
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:32,293
Sit.

165
00:20:32,364 --> 00:20:33,956
Don't move.

166
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,304
Believe me now, don't you?

167
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,612
You can't come in here.

168
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,515
More, more! More!

169
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:03,281
Look, if you want to see more,
you'll have to pay.

170
00:22:03,355 --> 00:22:05,346
- Yes? Pay.
- Work, work.

171
00:22:06,458 --> 00:22:07,823
Go help.

172
00:22:07,893 --> 00:22:10,191
You've changed your tune,
haven't you, mate? Now, come on.

173
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:12,196
- Show me. Show me.
- Come on.

174
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:15,700
Even if I told you, you wouldn't
understand it in a million years.

175
00:22:15,767 --> 00:22:18,565
How can picture move?
Show me, please!

176
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:21,197
Please! Please!
How can picture move?

177
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:23,207
- Thank you very much.
- Hey! No, no!

178
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:26,005
Show me!
Please! Wait!

179
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:25,895
Madame Jiang, Liu will be here
any minute.

180
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,073
I've got it!

181
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,085
I've figured it out!

182
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,954
The foreigner was right!

183
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,548
Pictures can move!

184
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,557
- You know what this is?
- A butterfly?

185
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,630
- And this?
- Also a butterfly.

186
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,295
Watch closely!

187
00:24:09,648 --> 00:24:11,081
Hey! It's flying!

188
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,781
Respect for order is paramount
at Feng Tai.

189
00:24:23,161 --> 00:24:27,291
A well-run business
must be orderly.

190
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:29,993
When a customer is here
for a portrait...

191
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,400
there should be no distractions.

192
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,735
We must pay strict attention
to propriety.

193
00:24:59,898 --> 00:25:01,832
About this morning.

194
00:25:03,101 --> 00:25:07,231
I'm truly sorry.
Please punish me.

195
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:12,071
You could have cost us a customer.

196
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,212
And the Widow Jiang, no less.

197
00:25:17,315 --> 00:25:19,783
Don't let it happen again.

198
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,512
No, sir.

199
00:25:23,054 --> 00:25:24,681
I promise I won't.

200
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,663
Perhaps my wife is right.

201
00:25:33,732 --> 00:25:36,701
Maybe marriage
would settle you down.

202
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,827
Marriage?

203
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,197
Good evening, neighbor.
This rain.

204
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:12,862
It could be worse.

205
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,740
Jewelry Tower.

206
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,086
Liu.

207
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,987
You're not a child anymore.

208
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:35,026
Get to the point, Jewelry Tower.

209
00:26:37,195 --> 00:26:38,719
This is a wonderful
opportunity for you.

210
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:40,765
The Widow Jiang
has her heart set on you.

211
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:42,424
The Widow Jiang!

212
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:45,794
Wants me?

213
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:52,103
Your worries would be over.

214
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:56,204
I was proud like you
when I was young.

215
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:02,250
Another leak.

216
00:27:04,356 --> 00:27:07,120
Don't worry, Father.

217
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,956
I'll fix it.

218
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:13,464
You don't want to end up like me.

219
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,431
Listen to me.

220
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:19,430
Father...

221
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:22,371
I can't marry the widow.

222
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,206
When my father spoke,
I obeyed!

223
00:27:27,512 --> 00:27:30,606
My only son has no respect for me.

224
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:37,616
Jewelry Tower.
Choose a wedding date.

225
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,694
He's so stubborn.

226
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:29,834
Western music!
Western show!

227
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:32,376
Step up!
Don't be shy!

228
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:38,676
Seeing is believing!
Come see for yourself!.

229
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,184
Is it magic?

230
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:43,015
It's better than magic!

231
00:28:49,594 --> 00:28:52,062
See pictures come alive in the dark!

232
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,360
Is music part of the show?

233
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:58,459
- Yes! It's all part of the show.
- I love a good show.

234
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,902
Let's go in and see it!

235
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:07,374
Five coins.
Thank you.

236
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:14,378
Right this way.

237
00:29:19,224 --> 00:29:22,318
What the bloody hell do you think
you're doing? This is my place!

238
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:27,690
- I help you.
- What?

239
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:30,098
I don't want your bloody help.
Go on, get out of here.

240
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:34,468
This is all very strange.

241
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:47,608
I don't have all day!

242
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,856
What sort of show is this?
No tea or seeds?

243
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,858
Right this way, young fellow.

244
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,200
Come on!

245
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:14,107
Look, why don't you go outside
and make sure everything is okay, yeah?

246
00:30:14,179 --> 00:30:16,613
All right? Go ahead.
Go outside.

247
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,309
And close the door.
It's got to be dark in there.

248
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,475
Please, don't panic!

249
00:31:58,816 --> 00:32:02,912
It's just an illusion.
See? It's all right.

250
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,113
What happened?

251
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:40,787
Typical, isn't it?

252
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:45,386
This is a special trick.
Keep your eyes on the screen.

253
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,164
Watch the screen!

254
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,868
Come on!

255
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,370
Put it on my account!

256
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:38,081
I've had enough of this!

257
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:42,445
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

258
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:45,756
Help-- Help you.

259
00:33:52,997 --> 00:33:54,191
Bloody hell.

260
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,267
I don't believe it.

261
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,704
A little bit to the left.
A little bit to the left.

262
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,409
To the left, to the left,
to the left.

263
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:14,542
Up a bit, up a bit.

264
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,917
No, over there-- Yeah.
Hold it there.

265
00:34:18,656 --> 00:34:21,284
Slightly to the left.
Perfect! Perfect!

266
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,951
Let's go!

267
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:42,070
I don't believe it.
It's bloody working.

268
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,627
White light that moves.
Incredible!

269
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,290
What a strange experience.

270
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:06,693
Young man...

271
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:09,763
how did you get those foreigners
to come here?

272
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:14,073
Behind that funny face
is a magic lens.

273
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:17,706
When we shine light through it,
another world is revealed.

274
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,115
I am lucky to have witnessed this.

275
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:24,677
As the old proverb says, "There are
mountains beyond the mountains."

276
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:28,555
-It's true!
-Come back with your family and friends.

277
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,753
Thank you. We will!

278
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,321
Something new at my age!

279
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,670
This is for you.
Be careful with that.

280
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,833
Be careful with that.
It's very expensive.

281
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:48,675
One, two, three--

282
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:53,745
Four. For you.

283
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,012
Thank you.

284
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:03,991
No, no, it's for you.

285
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,029
They're for you.
It's yours.

286
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,689
It's yours.

287
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,726
No, it's yours.
You earned it. Yours.

288
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:27,010
- Not enough.
- Eh?

289
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,020
Not enough?

290
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,990
This is my show.
It's my show.

291
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:38,221
Mine. Mine.

292
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:40,230
The show.

293
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,028
But no I...

294
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:47,597
no-no people.

295
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:49,606
No people, no I.

296
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:56,669
Fair enough.
All right.

297
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:59,739
Four, five...

298
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:02,285
six.

299
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:04,947
There you are.

300
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,112
Seven.

301
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,927
Eight.

302
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:21,098
How much do you want? I mean,
I've got expenses to pay, you know?

303
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:31,204
I need job.

304
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:38,488
It's like that, is it?

305
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:48,126
Well, I suppose I could find
some use for you somewhere.

306
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,896
All right.
You can call me Raymond.

307
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:57,630
- Master Raymond.
- Raymond.

308
00:37:59,176 --> 00:38:00,905
Your name?

309
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,878
Liu Jing Lun.

310
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,245
- Shou Liu.
- Shou Liu.

311
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:13,987
Congratulations, Shou Liu.

312
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,720
You've got yourself a job
working for Raymond Wallace...

313
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,955
showman extraordinaire.

314
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:20,622
See you tomorrow.

315
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,196
Oh, Liu.

316
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:32,032
They liked it, didn't they?

317
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,704
- Like.
- Good.

318
00:38:36,781 --> 00:38:39,614
- Good.
- This enough.

319
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,743
We're in...

320
00:39:17,955 --> 00:39:20,423
I think, luck.

321
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:35,529
Your future husband
is very attentive.

322
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:02,632
Let's get out of here!

323
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,396
I want to see Shadow Magic.

324
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:07,403
What about Lord Tan's new opera?

325
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:12,137
Listen to this.

326
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:15,804
"Shadow Magic comes alive
in the dark.

327
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:21,375
Every moment is a delightful surprise.
A Western girl dances...

328
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,716
her yellow hair flies in the air."

329
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,722
It's silly, but lovely.

330
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,483
It's true.
I've seen it.

331
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:35,658
Wonders from a thousand miles away
appear before your eyes!

332
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:38,167
I've got to see this!

333
00:40:40,204 --> 00:40:41,831
That's foreign mischief.

334
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,932
We should be loyal
to Lord Tan's opera.

335
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:03,424
Such coarse food!

336
00:41:05,396 --> 00:41:11,028
I chop my carrots so delicately,
they melt on your tongue.

337
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,831
I looked upon foreigners as soldiers.

338
00:41:13,904 --> 00:41:17,601
I never imagined them with families.

339
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,611
They appear to have feelings.

340
00:41:21,679 --> 00:41:24,614
Even a sense of humor.

341
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:28,118
The next scene
is a snowball fight.

342
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:31,848
It's very realistic.

343
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:11,251
Thank you, thank you.
Come again. Please.

344
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,694
Watch your step.

345
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,929
Liu?

346
00:42:24,675 --> 00:42:26,734
Miss Tan.

347
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,138
This is a strip of film.

348
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:36,346
Look. All the pictures are similar.

349
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,090
So this is Shadow Magic.

350
00:42:41,158 --> 00:42:44,150
I'm surprised you're playing
with these Western tricks.

351
00:42:45,362 --> 00:42:48,024
I never got your full name.

352
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:51,158
It's Liu Jing Lun.

353
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,732
But you can call me Liu.

354
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,240
Liu.

355
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:01,437
Why are you so intrigued
by Western gimmicks?

356
00:43:03,847 --> 00:43:07,681
They're wonderful inventions.

357
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,312
Why should we care
where they come from?

358
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:14,891
Let me show you something.

359
00:43:18,195 --> 00:43:20,493
There's old Zhang--
a new grandfather.

360
00:43:20,564 --> 00:43:22,555
His life is suddenly full of hope.

361
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,499
And there's Xiao Xing...

362
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,769
with her lover.

363
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,308
What a smile she has for him.

364
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:42,813
I can capture all this
with that machine.

365
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,855
You see what I mean?

366
00:43:56,767 --> 00:43:58,928
What do you think?

367
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,168
What does it matter what I think?

368
00:44:04,241 --> 00:44:07,802
It matters.
It matters very much.

369
00:44:07,878 --> 00:44:10,005
You're important to me.

370
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,183
I think about you often...

371
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,185
Miss Tan.

372
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,622
Revenues have dropped
considerably, sir.

373
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:03,091
Lord Tan, how have you been?

374
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,560
Please, sit.

375
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:12,935
Your photograph.

376
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,750
It's kind of you to bring it to me.

377
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,056
It's my privilege, sir.

378
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,991
See how it captures
your magnificence?

379
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:37,124
The lighter background...

380
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,635
makes your shoulders appear broader.

381
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:42,763
The darkness of the foreground...

382
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,330
suggests strength.

383
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:48,276
He means to say
you're very photogenic.

384
00:45:57,387 --> 00:45:59,355
Greetings, Master Ren.

385
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,525
Lord Tan, I have news for you.

386
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,030
It's the same foreigner...

387
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,726
who disrupted your photo session.

388
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,668
They call it Shadow Magic.

389
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,575
Shadow Magic?

390
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,111
Master Ren,
there's a Western show in town.

391
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:26,616
They play ghostly tricks
in the dark.

392
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:29,083
It's surprising...

393
00:46:29,153 --> 00:46:32,247
how many of our people...

394
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,450
are captivated by its spectacle.

395
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:41,888
Our opera is an ancient art.

396
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:48,399
It takes years to turn a student...

397
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:51,964
into an artist.

398
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:57,439
Why should we compare ourselves...

399
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,345
to this "Shallow Magic"?

400
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:01,213
It's called Shadow Magic.

401
00:47:03,587 --> 00:47:05,885
The foreigner had trouble at first.

402
00:47:05,956 --> 00:47:08,186
But then...

403
00:47:08,258 --> 00:47:11,159
after a young Chinese man...

404
00:47:11,228 --> 00:47:14,959
started helping him,
business picked up.

405
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,000
Pathetic.

406
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:20,167
Our culture will be destroyed...

407
00:47:20,237 --> 00:47:23,866
by our own people.

408
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:26,043
I'm gonna show you
a new foreign trick.

409
00:47:26,043 --> 00:47:27,840
I'm gonna show you
a new foreign trick.

410
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,142
There we go.

411
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,292
Here, put that in the middle.

412
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,426
Then you get a little bit of glue.

413
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:53,398
It's called "splicing."

414
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:54,903
Okay.

415
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:12,754
Ready?

416
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:16,058
Yeah.

417
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,937
Hey, how did that happen?

418
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:37,743
- That's called editing.
- Editing?

419
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:39,782
- Editing, yeah.
- Editing.

420
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,978
Watch this. Ready?
Watch.

421
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,921
Just fooling around, you know?

422
00:48:56,967 --> 00:48:58,992
How'd they get on this reel?

423
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:04,203
Family. Your family.

424
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,673
That's right-- family.

425
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,657
To my sister.

426
00:49:25,729 --> 00:49:29,165
To my nephews.

427
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:33,668
Don't worry.

428
00:49:33,737 --> 00:49:35,967
Now...

429
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:39,099
I take care of Raymond.

430
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,396
Raymond...

431
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:07,494
how can put that
on the Shadow Magic?

432
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,163
Put what?

433
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:16,277
- Kissing.
- Kissing.

434
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:21,276
Kissed many girls, have you, Liu?

435
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:23,376
No, never.

436
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:25,512
You know how to flirt,
don't you?

437
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,456
Flirt?

438
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,618
You tell her that...

439
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,992
she's the most beautiful woman...

440
00:50:33,063 --> 00:50:35,258
you've ever seen
in all your life.

441
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,425
No, no.

442
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:40,368
Exaggerating.
Women can't believe.

443
00:50:40,437 --> 00:50:43,031
She'll believe it if you mean it.

444
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,666
When you fall in love,
you'll mean it.

445
00:50:46,643 --> 00:50:48,076
Raymond.

446
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:56,685
I have a beautiful woman...

447
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:00,621
in my heart, here.

448
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:05,824
But my father...

449
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:08,091
want me to marry...

450
00:51:08,165 --> 00:51:11,430
a rich widow, you know?

451
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:13,469
- Yeah.
- He think it's good for me.

452
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,600
But I want to marry--

453
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:23,269
Why can't you live your own life?
Why not marry her?

454
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:26,281
How? No possible.

455
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:27,646
Why not?

456
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:33,014
Her here, rich.

457
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:36,787
My family, you know.
Long distance.

458
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:41,892
I thought Shadow Magic...

459
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:44,866
could change my situation.

460
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,994
But now...

461
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:51,664
our work...

462
00:51:51,741 --> 00:51:55,734
offend her family's business.

463
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,781
This is something I cannot do.

464
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,910
Liu, I'll tell you something.

465
00:52:02,986 --> 00:52:05,045
The truth is that...

466
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,650
my wife, she left me.

467
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,620
Took my children...

468
00:52:14,698 --> 00:52:16,495
went to live with another man.

469
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,033
Why?

470
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,165
Because I'm--

471
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:28,276
Because--

472
00:52:32,215 --> 00:52:34,615
Because I'm poor.

473
00:52:34,684 --> 00:52:38,916
You know why? I've frittered away
every cent I've ever earned.

474
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:41,890
That's all gonna be different.
I-- Liu.

475
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:48,823
Leave your home. Leave that
stupid photo shop and come with me.

476
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:53,330
A few years from now,
our women will be begging at our feet.

477
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:56,065
- Leave home?
- Yeah.

478
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:58,733
- Leave Fung Tai?
- Yeah.

479
00:52:58,808 --> 00:53:03,370
Only worst and lowest man
shows no loyalty.

480
00:53:17,327 --> 00:53:19,955
Why is Liu late?

481
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,467
Sir, I would like
to talk to you about Liu.

482
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,698
Mi Hu, what are you doing?

483
00:53:28,772 --> 00:53:30,740
Put that thing where it belongs.

484
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,003
What were you mumbling about?

485
00:53:35,078 --> 00:53:38,206
I hear that Liu--

486
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:45,549
Master, I apologize for being late.

487
00:53:47,490 --> 00:53:50,323
Master Ren has been waiting
for over an hour.

488
00:53:54,531 --> 00:53:59,798
At home, my father-- my father is ill.
He needs my help.

489
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:01,894
I'll send Dr. Zhang to visit him.

490
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:07,069
No, thank you.
He is better now.

491
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:08,974
What a quick recovery.

492
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:12,310
Chang, go prepare
the photo plates.

493
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,119
Liu, you stay.

494
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:26,723
You seem tired.

495
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,730
Is anything wrong?

496
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:32,029
Well, my father has been ill...

497
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:34,832
and I've been busy
preparing for the wedding.

498
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:41,175
Becoming a husband
is a big change.

499
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:45,772
To have a good family and fortune...

500
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:47,976
these are great things
for a man.

501
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,750
The Widow Jiang--

502
00:54:55,892 --> 00:55:00,522
Well, I know--
I know you don't fancy her much.

503
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:06,466
But Liu...

504
00:55:06,536 --> 00:55:08,868
it's not so bad.

505
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,141
Compromise is the essence of life.

506
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:23,916
My father arranged my marriage.

507
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,417
You know, I wasn't happy
about it either.

508
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:32,951
But my wife's family provided
the money for this business.

509
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:35,827
And now,
Fu Guan is growing up.

510
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,202
And one day...

511
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:45,571
all this will be his.

512
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:51,579
Liu, stay for dinner.

513
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:53,582
Master, tonight I-I--

514
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:57,051
We won't be able to do this so often
once you're married.

515
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:00,419
I'll do what you say, sir.

516
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,093
Cheers.

517
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:10,131
Cheers.

518
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:24,513
I invited him to dinner.

519
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,516
You can't invite just anyone.

520
00:56:27,584 --> 00:56:29,848
But he's already here.

521
00:56:29,919 --> 00:56:32,285
Uncle hates dining
with your little workers.

522
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,620
And so do I.

523
00:56:42,966 --> 00:56:45,662
Liu's not just a worker to me.

524
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,896
He's a dear friend.

525
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:51,566
You liked him enough
to arrange his marriage.

526
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:53,575
Exactly. And once he's married...

527
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,436
the Widow Jiang
will keep him in his place.

528
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:30,710
Oh, Miss Tan!

529
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,113
What a pleasant surprise.

530
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,948
Does your father know you're here?

531
00:57:38,988 --> 00:57:41,923
No, he doesn't, and he needn't.

532
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:45,390
I would like my photograph taken.

533
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:51,259
But I can't take your photograph
without your father's permission.

534
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:58,000
You mean even you are afraid
the camera will steal my soul?

535
00:57:58,074 --> 00:58:02,670
Then no woman
will come to your studio.

536
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:07,349
Please, come this way.

537
00:58:15,725 --> 00:58:19,058
Liu, take her photograph.

538
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:20,561
Ladies.

539
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,713
Liu.

540
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:45,113
Don't worry. I won't tell my father
about your Shadow Magic.

541
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,152
Thank you, but...

542
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:51,716
I plan to tell him myself.

543
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:55,286
That you are the one
ruining his business?

544
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,526
Well, yes.

545
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,628
If you tell him that,
he'll never accept you.

546
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:05,196
Does that mean if I don't tell him,
I would be accepted?

547
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,909
Look right here.

548
00:59:24,861 --> 00:59:27,591
Straight into the lens.

549
00:59:31,434 --> 00:59:34,198
He's touching her!

550
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,646
A little smile.

551
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,556
You are captured forever.

552
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:11,464
I need another plate.
Excuse me.

553
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:22,747
Poor Liu.

554
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:27,279
He's unusually distracted.

555
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:29,325
He's been so busy...

556
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:33,624
preparing for his wedding.

557
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:35,027
His wedding?

558
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,191
Liu is engaged
to marry a widow.

559
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:55,479
I brought more plates.

560
01:00:55,551 --> 01:00:58,349
- I must go.
- Wait!

561
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,816
I'll bring the prints
to you.

562
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,986
You needn't bother.
I'll send for them.

563
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:30,076
He's coming, he's coming.

564
01:01:33,656 --> 01:01:35,749
What's going on?

565
01:01:35,825 --> 01:01:38,293
You should know better.
Why humiliate yourself?

566
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,063
People like us...

567
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:46,567
we're born small...

568
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,536
and we die small.

569
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,538
That's our fate.

570
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:59,440
Master Ren...

571
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,676
my father is sick.

572
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:04,914
I need some time off.

573
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:08,690
You told me he was doing well.

574
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:11,124
Yes, but--
but now he is sick again.

575
01:02:11,194 --> 01:02:12,923
I have to go.

576
01:02:28,611 --> 01:02:31,512
We need new film.

577
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,912
Like this.

578
01:02:35,952 --> 01:02:38,216
Claire?
She's in England.

579
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:39,982
No. No.

580
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:45,523
I say... Chinese film.

581
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,961
Local people, local scenes.

582
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,295
- You know?
- Chinese people.

583
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:53,699
- Chinese film.
- Film.

584
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,465
You're crazy.
Who'd want to see that?

585
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:58,098
They can walk outside their door
and see it anytime they want.

586
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,439
Bloody fantastic.

587
01:03:49,258 --> 01:03:52,056
- We are in trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

588
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:31,797
Local people, local scenes.

589
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,802
Sure.

590
01:04:57,260 --> 01:05:01,424
I can see you fine from here.
Why should I look in there?

591
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:03,260
Uncle...

592
01:05:03,332 --> 01:05:05,960
when this machine looks at you...

593
01:05:06,035 --> 01:05:07,969
your image is saved.

594
01:05:08,037 --> 01:05:10,870
In a hundred years,
your image will still be there.

595
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,238
I'm 70 now.

596
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:15,641
That would make me 1 70!

597
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:17,872
- Right.
- How would I look then?

598
01:05:17,947 --> 01:05:19,881
Exactly as you do now.

599
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:22,076
You won't have aged a bit.

600
01:05:23,386 --> 01:05:25,684
Say no more. I'm ready.

601
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:29,717
If you please.

602
01:05:38,801 --> 01:05:42,567
I feel better already. Your turn.

603
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:44,868
Look at the hole.

604
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:51,798
Good. Good.

605
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:02,748
Good.

606
01:07:02,818 --> 01:07:04,752
Good, good, good.

607
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,163
Slow down, will you?

608
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:25,404
Beautiful. Huh?

609
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,136
- It's a good shot.
- Good.

610
01:07:39,488 --> 01:07:41,422
Beautiful!

611
01:07:45,494 --> 01:07:48,019
I'm overwhelmed.

612
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:50,588
Love China.

613
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:56,596
First emperor...

614
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:58,640
build this wall...

615
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,540
to defend against...

616
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:03,578
foreign invader.

617
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:06,240
Like me?

618
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,249
Less dangerous.

619
01:08:23,833 --> 01:08:26,028
China doesn't need more walls.

620
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,929
It needs someone like you
to carry this...

621
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:35,499
this magnificence
to the outside world.

622
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,341
Just think of it.

623
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,974
You, me...

624
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:43,848
recording life before it changes...

625
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,354
show it to the whole world.

626
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:50,821
Might even go down in history.

627
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:55,021
Whole world? Huh?

628
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:58,861
Where?
Where is that?

629
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:05,299
Liu, leave that photo shop...

630
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:07,604
and become my partner.

631
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:11,310
The future belongs
to the moving picture.

632
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:07,234
Liu, what is this all about?

633
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,767
I've come...

634
01:10:13,842 --> 01:10:15,776
to apologize.

635
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:38,729
I want to say...

636
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:42,794
I'm truly sorry, but...

637
01:10:44,573 --> 01:10:47,041
I must continue with Shadow Magic.

638
01:10:48,110 --> 01:10:49,975
I can't help it.

639
01:10:50,045 --> 01:10:52,479
Without Shadow Magic...

640
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,846
I'm nobody.

641
01:10:54,917 --> 01:10:57,750
I know our show hurts the opera.

642
01:10:57,820 --> 01:10:59,310
I'm sorry.

643
01:10:59,388 --> 01:11:01,549
You needn't concern yourself.

644
01:11:01,624 --> 01:11:04,320
You're no competition for my father.

645
01:11:04,393 --> 01:11:08,124
Western culture can't overshadow
our opera.

646
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:12,291
Even if there were
20 Shadow Magics in town...

647
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:17,738
there would be only one Lord Tan.

648
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:23,205
The people will always love him.

649
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,577
Of course. You are right.

650
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:34,655
Actually...

651
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,025
I came to see you.

652
01:11:41,096 --> 01:11:42,188
You came to see me?

653
01:11:47,803 --> 01:11:49,168
Why?

654
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,199
Don't you know by now?

655
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:13,387
You're the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

656
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:18,559
I love you and I think
you love me too.

657
01:12:18,634 --> 01:12:20,966
You must not speak like this.

658
01:12:21,036 --> 01:12:24,062
We cannot see each other.

659
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,039
But why?

660
01:12:26,108 --> 01:12:28,042
You know why.

661
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,675
Wait!

662
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,646
Just wait and see.

663
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:41,213
I'm going to make a name for myself!.

664
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:58,973
Where is Liu?

665
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,703
He's absent again, Master.

666
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:04,007
Again?

667
01:13:04,079 --> 01:13:07,537
Please, have a seat.

668
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:13,217
His father must be very ill.

669
01:13:13,288 --> 01:13:15,153
Liu is a good son.

670
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:24,700
Tell me, why do Chinese people bow?

671
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:28,498
If I look at your shoes...

672
01:13:28,570 --> 01:13:31,198
I know you're poor...

673
01:13:31,273 --> 01:13:33,207
you're rich.

674
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,708
Oh, Liu.

675
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,715
If only all Chinese people
were as charming as you are.

676
01:13:41,984 --> 01:13:46,148
All Chinese people
are charming like me.

677
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:49,520
Others as kind as you?

678
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:51,923
Well, they are
when you get to know them.

679
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:58,099
Good.

680
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:04,264
Raymond, I must go now.

681
01:14:04,339 --> 01:14:07,308
Too late.
Master Ren will be upset.

682
01:14:08,677 --> 01:14:10,736
- Hang on a sec.
- Huh?

683
01:14:10,813 --> 01:14:13,839
Put a feather in my cap.
Look at this.

684
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:17,113
- It's from the British envoy.
- What?

685
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:20,815
"The envoy wishes to entertain
Her Royal Highness...

686
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:24,017
the Empress Dowager--"
Dou Fouai--

687
01:14:24,092 --> 01:14:25,855
- Dou Fouai?
- Yeah.

688
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:30,422
"with a presentation of Shadow Magic,
the latest innovation from the West...

689
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,626
at the Royal Palace."

690
01:14:32,701 --> 01:14:35,169
Hah!
How about that?

691
01:14:38,006 --> 01:14:41,169
We're going to the Royal Palace!
Us!

692
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,975
Wait until Claire gets
a load of this, then, eh?

693
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,180
I told you I'd amount to something!

694
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:34,261
Hello, Fu Guan.

695
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,480
Master Ren knows you lied to him.

696
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:54,641
Your father was never sick.

697
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,207
You haven't been at home.

698
01:15:57,286 --> 01:15:59,720
Wait, I can explain.

699
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:06,053
I should hope so.

700
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,163
Where have you been all this time?

701
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:12,857
I was--

702
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:15,798
No more lies!

703
01:16:15,871 --> 01:16:17,930
I've been making films
with the foreigner.

704
01:16:19,141 --> 01:16:22,110
- What did I tell you?
- Please, Master Ren!

705
01:16:22,177 --> 01:16:25,874
I know I betrayed your trust.

706
01:16:25,948 --> 01:16:27,939
I lied to you.

707
01:16:28,016 --> 01:16:29,950
I was wrong.

708
01:16:39,962 --> 01:16:43,420
I beg of you.
I'm not a bad person.

709
01:16:43,498 --> 01:16:46,331
I'll prove to you
I have a loyal heart.

710
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:56,641
He's trying to sweet-talk you.

711
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,817
We have important work to do.

712
01:17:07,889 --> 01:17:10,289
I don't have time for this.

713
01:17:12,127 --> 01:17:16,086
I'll give you one last chance.

714
01:17:16,164 --> 01:17:18,758
But you must come to your senses...

715
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:20,734
or I will cut you off.

716
01:17:22,638 --> 01:17:24,572
Now, get up.

717
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:31,644
We have much to do before our visit
to the Royal Palace.

718
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,476
The Royal Palace?

719
01:17:35,183 --> 01:17:37,208
We're going to take
the empress' picture!

720
01:17:37,285 --> 01:17:39,310
On her birthday!
At the palace!

721
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:41,322
Isn't that exciting?

722
01:17:44,292 --> 01:17:47,056
Master...

723
01:17:47,129 --> 01:17:53,500
please allow me to work for you
and Raymond at the same time.

724
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,370
What?

725
01:17:57,706 --> 01:18:02,040
Raymond, the foreigner, and I
were also invited...

726
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:06,410
to the Royal Palace
to show Shadow Magic.

727
01:18:06,481 --> 01:18:13,717
It's our big chance. Let us do our
show first, then I'll assist you.

728
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:16,087
Please, Master.

729
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:20,254
Our city is changing every day.

730
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:24,890
They say the time will come when men
will cut off their pigtails...

731
01:18:24,966 --> 01:18:26,934
and women will unbind their feet.

732
01:18:28,537 --> 01:18:32,166
We can't turn back the clock.

733
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:37,177
I want to record life
before it changes forever.

734
01:18:37,245 --> 01:18:40,271
So our children will understand us...

735
01:18:40,348 --> 01:18:44,751
and the rest of the world
will appreciate us.

736
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:51,490
So many people...

737
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:54,893
are touched by our films.

738
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:57,295
For the first time...

739
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:00,425
I feel part of
something bigger than myself.

740
01:19:00,502 --> 01:19:01,867
Please, Master Ren.

741
01:19:01,937 --> 01:19:04,872
Let's do this together.

742
01:19:06,508 --> 01:19:08,738
Let's make our own shows...

743
01:19:08,810 --> 01:19:11,244
and present them...

744
01:19:11,313 --> 01:19:13,611
to the whole world!

745
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:16,173
You could be like Raymond--

746
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,048
your own master...

747
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:21,351
free from your wife's family.

748
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:25,091
Please, Master.

749
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:36,833
- Chang!
- Yes, Master.

750
01:19:36,905 --> 01:19:40,363
You are now my chief photographer.

751
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:45,641
Tell Liu he is forbidden
to return to Feng Tai.

752
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:49,616
Fu Guan, come here!

753
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,866
Back to work!

754
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,735
Didn't expect you back so soon.

755
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:44,863
No takers at the photo shop, eh?

756
01:20:58,353 --> 01:21:02,346
Here's the ungrateful little wretch!

757
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,024
Liu! Come with me.

758
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:11,293
What's the trouble, old man?

759
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:13,698
You're the trouble!

760
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:16,669
You've ruined my son's life!

761
01:21:16,738 --> 01:21:19,468
You foreigners have no respect!

762
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:21,509
No loyalty!

763
01:21:21,576 --> 01:21:23,168
No tradition!

764
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:26,009
You just want to use us!

765
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,912
And you!

766
01:21:30,986 --> 01:21:32,954
You've brought me nothing but shame!

767
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:40,420
How could you betray
a dear friend like Master Ren...

768
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:44,295
who has been so good to us,
and ally yourself with this foreigner?

769
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:47,392
So he can play his dirty tricks
and cheat our people.

770
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50,764
I'll tear you apart!

771
01:22:02,717 --> 01:22:05,049
Now you will obey me.

772
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:08,753
Marry this woman.

773
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:12,753
Do it!

774
01:22:18,066 --> 01:22:20,557
Apologize to your father.

775
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:23,195
Say you'll return to Feng Tai.

776
01:22:23,271 --> 01:22:24,761
Please.

777
01:22:24,839 --> 01:22:27,706
Say you'll marry her.
Do it.

778
01:22:45,694 --> 01:22:49,323
You bastard!

779
01:22:49,397 --> 01:22:52,889
You continue to disgrace me.

780
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,937
You are no longer my son!

781
01:23:27,802 --> 01:23:29,861
You can stay with me, Liu.

782
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,932
I've got plenty of clothes.

783
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:42,806
Hey.

784
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:46,752
You could be the first
moving-picture man in all of China.

785
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:54,351
Was she your intended?

786
01:23:54,429 --> 01:23:56,363
The widow?

787
01:23:57,599 --> 01:24:00,568
I think you're well out
of that one, mate, eh?

788
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:02,102
Eh?

789
01:24:02,170 --> 01:24:04,570
I think that alone calls
for celebration, eh?

790
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,276
Raymond, I can't wear this.

791
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:13,473
- I feel foolish.
- Come on.

792
01:24:13,548 --> 01:24:15,812
You really don't like my present?

793
01:24:17,652 --> 01:24:20,382
Come on.

794
01:24:20,455 --> 01:24:21,888
No.

795
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,357
Look, Liu, you've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

796
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,691
Nothing.

797
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:30,287
Listen, look.
We'll sit in the back, yeah?

798
01:24:30,365 --> 01:24:33,391
That way you can see her
and she won't be able to see you.

799
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:35,436
Come on. Come on.

800
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:38,739
Come on.

801
01:24:55,490 --> 01:24:57,424
Excuse me. Excuse me.

802
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:03,927
The foreigner!
How could he appreciate opera?

803
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:46,633
I can't believe they let him in.

804
01:25:48,943 --> 01:25:51,707
Hey, Liu, are you Chinese
or a barbarian?

805
01:25:58,553 --> 01:26:01,283
Traitors don't belong here.

806
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:04,491
Look at the two of them.

807
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:14,529
He isn't applauding.

808
01:26:14,602 --> 01:26:17,366
He's insulting Lord Tan!

809
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:27,280
Well, my friend, this appears
not to be such a good idea after all.

810
01:26:27,348 --> 01:26:29,282
Perhaps I'd better leave.

811
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:31,580
- No, Raymond. We can't leave.
- You stay.

812
01:26:31,653 --> 01:26:34,053
You enjoy the show.
You stay.

813
01:26:34,122 --> 01:26:36,716
Don't shame me more
in front of my people.

814
01:26:36,791 --> 01:26:38,850
He's leaving in the middle
of the performance!

815
01:26:38,927 --> 01:26:40,918
He should be taught a lesson!

816
01:27:13,428 --> 01:27:15,362
Go away!

817
01:27:16,698 --> 01:27:20,464
Don't touch me!
You devil! You devil!

818
01:27:22,437 --> 01:27:24,871
Because you, I lost everything.

819
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:27,931
My job, my family, my honor.

820
01:27:28,009 --> 01:27:30,102
The woman I love.

821
01:27:30,178 --> 01:27:34,080
I meet you,
it's my downfall!

822
01:27:35,850 --> 01:27:38,751
If you want to quit,
go ahead, quit.

823
01:27:38,820 --> 01:27:41,414
I don't need you.

824
01:27:41,489 --> 01:27:45,289
I didn't come halfway around the world
to be held back by a coward!

825
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,796
Go ahead! Leave!
It's okay.

826
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:50,797
Huh? Leave!

827
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:57,831
Let me tell you something, Liu.
You've changed.

828
01:27:57,905 --> 01:28:00,703
You're not like
these other people anymore.

829
01:28:00,775 --> 01:28:03,642
You've got nowhere
to go back to!

830
01:28:19,761 --> 01:28:22,286
Wait, wait!
Liu, wait, wait!

831
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:28,460
I'm sorry, Liu.
I'm sorry!

832
01:28:28,536 --> 01:28:29,867
I'm sorry.

833
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:35,104
After the private screening...

834
01:28:35,176 --> 01:28:37,508
hey, we'll be laughing.

835
01:29:07,241 --> 01:29:09,175
You all listen to me.

836
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,806
I'm the one.

837
01:29:15,083 --> 01:29:19,144
I'm the one who has been
invited to the palace!

838
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:24,620
You think I'm nothing...

839
01:29:24,692 --> 01:29:27,183
but I'll show you.

840
01:30:54,849 --> 01:30:56,840
This way, please.

841
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:48,895
You may begin.

842
01:33:39,981 --> 01:33:43,747
We are very intrigued
by the foreigner's technology.

843
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:45,649
Indeed, Your Benevolent Majesty.

844
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:47,654
They know how to entertain.

845
01:33:47,722 --> 01:33:48,882
You are right, Your Majesty.

846
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:53,120
They invented this
just for your pleasure.

847
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:23,614
Shouldn't we be leaving, Master?

848
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:37,236
She likes me.

849
01:34:57,491 --> 01:34:59,925
Fire! Fire!

850
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:22,874
- Get away from him!
- What? I'm trying to help!

851
01:35:38,032 --> 01:35:42,366
The barbarian and his accomplice
must be punished.

852
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:46,338
They threatened Her Majesty's life.

853
01:35:48,776 --> 01:35:51,745
What do you suggest?

854
01:35:52,980 --> 01:35:54,072
Execute them.

855
01:36:05,392 --> 01:36:06,620
Lord Tan...

856
01:36:07,862 --> 01:36:10,729
you wish to say something?

857
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:14,063
Please inform Her Majesty...

858
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:19,605
I believe this young Chinese man
meant no harm.

859
01:36:21,976 --> 01:36:24,774
Like so many others
in our country...

860
01:36:24,845 --> 01:36:27,279
he was led astray
by foreign influence...

861
01:36:27,348 --> 01:36:30,909
but I believe he can mend
the error of his ways.

862
01:36:34,755 --> 01:36:36,950
Small employee.
I'm responsible.

863
01:36:42,663 --> 01:36:45,496
The young man knows
some of the foreigner's tricks.

864
01:36:45,566 --> 01:36:49,730
Her Majesty feels he might be
useful to us in the future.

865
01:36:52,940 --> 01:36:54,874
You may rise.

866
01:37:00,414 --> 01:37:04,646
Lord Tan, your performance today
so pleased Her Majesty...

867
01:37:04,718 --> 01:37:08,449
she finds her spirit made forgiving
by the beauty of your art.

868
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:12,684
The young man will be released.
The foreign conspirator...

869
01:37:12,760 --> 01:37:14,352
will be expelled from the country.

870
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,726
Thanks to Her Benevolent Majesty!

871
01:37:16,797 --> 01:37:18,890
Guards!

872
01:37:23,604 --> 01:37:25,902
Hey! Liu! Liu!

873
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:30,266
What's going on?
Where are they taking me?

874
01:37:32,713 --> 01:37:34,908
Long live Her Majesty!

875
01:38:29,236 --> 01:38:31,227
Is there a Liu Jing Lun here?

876
01:38:33,073 --> 01:38:36,099
- I am Liu.
- This package is for you.

877
01:38:39,113 --> 01:38:41,047
From England.

878
01:39:11,779 --> 01:39:13,747
"Dear Liu.

879
01:39:13,814 --> 01:39:17,750
It's hard to believe that one's fate
can change in the blink of an eye.

880
01:39:17,818 --> 01:39:21,777
We were parted from each other
in flames and smoke...

881
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:24,790
without even being able
to say good-bye.

882
01:39:24,858 --> 01:39:28,624
I find myself looking at
the ocean between us.

883
01:39:28,696 --> 01:39:31,722
Memories of you bring
smiles to my face.

884
01:39:34,935 --> 01:39:39,031
Our Shadow Magic was the one thing in
my life that made me feel truly alive.

885
01:39:41,775 --> 01:39:44,243
That is why I need to
continue filming.

886
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,641
Wherever I find
interesting people...

887
01:39:48,716 --> 01:39:51,116
or wherever I see
interesting lives...

888
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:53,551
I want to be there
with my camera.

889
01:39:55,356 --> 01:39:58,382
Enclosed are the films
we shot in China.

890
01:39:58,459 --> 01:40:00,586
I want you to have them.

891
01:40:02,196 --> 01:40:07,133
Our friendship is preserved
in the fond memories of these frames.

892
01:40:07,201 --> 01:40:09,396
My thoughts are with you.

893
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:11,404
Raymond. "

894
01:40:50,077 --> 01:40:52,875
Why is it blurry, Liu?

895
01:40:52,946 --> 01:40:55,346
I need a lens and I can't afford it.

896
01:40:57,885 --> 01:40:59,876
A lens?

897
01:40:59,953 --> 01:41:03,480
Like eyeglasses...

898
01:41:03,557 --> 01:41:05,491
for the projector.

899
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:10,996
I know what you need.

900
01:41:11,065 --> 01:41:13,829
I'll trade you something
that might work.

901
01:41:14,968 --> 01:41:16,230
I'll take a look.

902
01:41:22,443 --> 01:41:24,434
Jewelry Tower!

903
01:41:34,888 --> 01:41:37,550
One night only!

904
01:41:37,624 --> 01:41:40,593
"Shadow Magic Show" at Fu Shou Hall!

905
01:41:42,996 --> 01:41:47,194
Come one! Come all!
Shadow Magic at Fu Shou Hall!

906
01:41:52,372 --> 01:41:54,602
Shadow Magic?

907
01:41:54,675 --> 01:41:57,769
If we wanted to, we could ruin it.

908
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:02,405
We could ruin nothing.

909
01:42:02,483 --> 01:42:04,508
It will come sooner or later.

910
01:42:06,620 --> 01:42:09,783
This is only the beginning.

911
01:42:13,293 --> 01:42:15,557
Father, can we go?

912
01:42:17,764 --> 01:42:21,757
Liu has not invited us.

913
01:42:21,835 --> 01:42:23,769
Forget about Shadow Magic.

914
01:42:23,837 --> 01:42:27,705
Liu was almost killed.

915
01:42:27,774 --> 01:42:29,708
Crazy!

916
01:42:38,352 --> 01:42:40,286
What am I doing?

917
01:42:47,427 --> 01:42:50,055
What am I trying to prove?

918
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:55,725
We can't escape what drives us.

919
01:43:19,226 --> 01:43:22,525
Tell me how I'm going
to feel this time.

920
01:43:22,596 --> 01:43:25,497
Take a seat and you'll see.

921
01:43:28,101 --> 01:43:30,365
There's Liu.

922
01:43:30,437 --> 01:43:31,529
Father?

923
01:43:31,605 --> 01:43:34,802
You came!

924
01:43:36,476 --> 01:43:38,410
Where are your glasses?

925
01:43:40,614 --> 01:43:43,242
How can you see without your glasses?

926
01:43:43,317 --> 01:43:45,251
I can see what I need to see.

927
01:43:46,987 --> 01:43:50,616
Show me to the front.

928
01:43:50,691 --> 01:43:52,625
Go on, Liu.

929
01:43:54,494 --> 01:43:57,361
- We should leave.
- We might go up in smoke!

930
01:43:57,431 --> 01:44:00,264
I love Shadow Magic.
I'll take the risk.

931
01:44:11,111 --> 01:44:14,137
Wel--Welcome.

932
01:44:14,214 --> 01:44:16,876
Welcome, everyone...

933
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:21,410
to-to Shadow Magic.

934
01:44:23,357 --> 01:44:27,316
Tonight, for the first time...

935
01:44:27,394 --> 01:44:31,262
we will see ourselves...

936
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:33,765
the way we are.

937
01:44:33,834 --> 01:44:37,395
We will watch our lives unfold...

938
01:44:37,471 --> 01:44:39,405
as we live them every day.

939
01:45:08,802 --> 01:45:10,793
Why put out the lights?

940
01:45:10,871 --> 01:45:14,602
Certain things should be
kept in the dark.

941
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:19,677
I was already in the dark.

942
01:45:31,591 --> 01:45:33,115
Hey! That's me!

943
01:45:34,728 --> 01:45:36,662
Do I look that old?

944
01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:42,031
My camel! That's my camel!

945
01:45:50,444 --> 01:45:52,935
Next should be me!

946
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,947
It is me!

947
01:45:56,883 --> 01:45:59,147
Thrilling!

948
01:45:59,219 --> 01:46:01,380
What do you see?

949
01:46:01,455 --> 01:46:04,390
A man and a camel on a street.

950
01:46:05,459 --> 01:46:07,086
What's so thrilling about that?

951
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,651
Shadow Magic is good for the eyes.

952
01:46:09,730 --> 01:46:12,164
But you can only see it...

953
01:46:12,232 --> 01:46:13,665
not hear it.

954
01:46:13,734 --> 01:46:16,760
Your ears feel something's lacking.

955
01:46:16,837 --> 01:46:19,806
Now that you mention it,
it does seem that way.

956
01:46:19,873 --> 01:46:23,172
That's why you need us
talkative comedians.

957
01:46:23,243 --> 01:46:24,870
We bring the pleasure to your ears.

958
01:46:27,247 --> 01:46:29,374
Shadow Magic has no mercy.

959
01:46:29,449 --> 01:46:32,043
Everything is magnified...

960
01:46:32,119 --> 01:46:34,087
larger than life.

961
01:46:34,154 --> 01:46:36,088
- The thin--
- The fat--

962
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:40,024
- The round--
- Wrinkle upon wrinkle!

963
01:46:40,093 --> 01:46:43,256
- There's nowhere to hide!
- Nope!

964
01:46:44,164 --> 01:46:46,223
Our people know how to be courteous.

965
01:46:46,299 --> 01:46:49,097
- Can't you tell?
- Look!

966
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:51,103
How are you?

967
01:46:51,171 --> 01:46:53,162
Have you eaten?

968
01:46:53,240 --> 01:46:55,071
Thank you. My pleasure.

969
01:46:55,142 --> 01:46:57,667
Why do we greet each other like this?

970
01:46:57,744 --> 01:47:00,542
It means:
"I've had the pleasure of eating.

971
01:47:00,614 --> 01:47:03,378
If you haven't,
come to my house."

972
01:47:03,450 --> 01:47:06,442
- Have you eaten?
- My pleasure!

973
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:13,984
That's too much eating!

974
01:47:14,060 --> 01:47:17,496
Of course! But eating is
the main talent of our civilization!

975
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:19,896
So true!

976
01:47:27,874 --> 01:47:30,536
Ling! Come in. Please sit.

977
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:33,442
I want to try.

978
01:47:49,496 --> 01:47:53,193
Here.

979
01:47:53,266 --> 01:47:55,200
Now count evenly.

980
01:47:55,268 --> 01:47:57,463
One, two, three.

981
01:48:14,921 --> 01:48:17,549
My friend Raymond...

982
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:19,524
explained to me--

983
01:48:19,593 --> 01:48:23,654
He said,
if we love each other...

984
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:26,494
it's all right to show affection.

985
01:48:58,632 --> 01:49:00,998
I never knew I was so fast!

986
01:49:01,067 --> 01:49:03,058
You're amazing!

987
01:49:12,646 --> 01:49:14,307
That's incredible!

988
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:16,645
I can't believe my eyes.

989
01:49:26,726 --> 01:49:29,388
Those mountains.

990
01:49:29,462 --> 01:49:32,693
The river--

991
01:49:32,766 --> 01:49:34,393
how it sings.

992
01:50:02,395 --> 01:50:06,923
The horizon--
it seems to extend forever.

993
01:50:31,491 --> 01:50:33,186
That's neat!

994
01:50:37,230 --> 01:50:39,061
My son--

995
01:50:42,335 --> 01:50:44,860
My son did all this!

996
01:51:07,594 --> 01:51:12,122
Ding Jung Shan, the first
Chinese film ever made...

997
01:51:12,198 --> 01:51:15,759
was produced at Feng Tai Studio in 1905
by Liu Jing Lun and Ren Jing Feng.

998
01:51:19,039 --> 01:51:25,171
It starred Peking's legendary
opera singer Lord Tan Xinpei.

999
01:52:07,320 --> 01:52:09,311
At the turn of the century...

1000
01:52:09,389 --> 01:52:11,880
a handful of foreigners brought
motion pictures to China.

1001
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:19,362
The name of the first Shadow Magic
showman remains unknown.
