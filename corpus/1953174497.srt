4
00:01:22,108 --> 00:01:23,825
Holy shit! Shit!

5
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,826
It's okay.

6
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:27,077
We'll be all right.

7
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,429
Okay, it's okay. It's okay.

8
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:29,929
- Shh. Be cool.
- No, we are far from cool!

9
00:01:29,996 --> 00:01:31,781
What the fuck
is wrong with you?!

10
00:01:31,848 --> 00:01:32,382
Oh, fuck.

11
00:01:32,449 --> 00:01:33,516
What's happening?

12
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:35,285
She's bleeding. Is she okay?

13
00:01:35,402 --> 00:01:36,753
I... I don't know. I don't know.

14
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:38,738
Why the fuck is she
bleeding so much?

15
00:01:38,806 --> 00:01:40,723
'Cause she's shot in the fucking face.
What do you think?

16
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:42,008
Shit!

17
00:01:42,076 --> 00:01:43,309
Hold on, man.

18
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:45,827
- What the fuck?
- Everybody hold on.

19
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:46,678
Hold on!

21
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,371
Hi, Ms. Williams.

22
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:32,766
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

23
00:04:32,834 --> 00:04:35,236
Don't worry. We're still
waiting on Michael.

24
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:37,271
Shit. Did someone call him?

25
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:39,106
No. You want me to?

26
00:04:39,173 --> 00:04:41,442
No. I'll call him.

27
00:04:48,032 --> 00:04:49,166
Hello.

28
00:04:49,233 --> 00:04:51,034
Hi. It's Carley.

29
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:52,418
Um...

30
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:53,970
You coming to school?

31
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:55,539
Oh, shit.

32
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,339
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

33
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:59,775
Um, all right.
I'll be right there.

34
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:05,114
Babe, where are you going?

35
00:05:05,181 --> 00:05:07,016
I gotta go.

36
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,467
Where?

37
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:11,203
It's a group class thing.

38
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,770
Right now?

39
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:13,888
Come on, Lena.

40
00:05:13,956 --> 00:05:16,607
You're not gonna be
insecure about this, too.

41
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:19,444
No. I'm not insecure.

42
00:05:24,917 --> 00:05:27,784
Okay. Well, are we
still on for tonight?

43
00:05:27,852 --> 00:05:29,936
Uh, I can't tonight, baby.

44
00:05:32,307 --> 00:05:34,057
Another group?

45
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,392
I got a thing.

46
00:05:35,459 --> 00:05:38,661
Listen, this insecurity thing
is really starting to wear...

47
00:05:38,729 --> 00:05:40,947
Why can't you just tell me
what you're doing tonight?

48
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:44,383
Why do I have to?
Can't you just trust me?

49
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,487
I gotta go.

50
00:05:48,555 --> 00:05:50,606
See you later.

51
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:52,058
Wait.

52
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:54,994
I love you.

53
00:06:28,325 --> 00:06:29,509
Morning, handsome.

54
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,710
Hey, Ms. Brown.

55
00:06:30,778 --> 00:06:32,211
You look ravishing today.

56
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:33,513
- Today?
- Always.

57
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:36,349
Uh... Huh. You get
the final word yet?

58
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:38,017
Nah, not yet.

59
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:42,387
I'm gonna say
a prayer for you, kid.

60
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,556
Appreciate it.

61
00:06:44,623 --> 00:06:45,957
Need all that I can get.

62
00:06:50,296 --> 00:06:51,863
Don't be late
for school, little man.

63
00:06:51,931 --> 00:06:54,516
Yeah. Yeah, I... I'm going.

64
00:06:56,885 --> 00:06:58,518
What's on your mind, Ray?

65
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,988
I... Look, I know I'm
supposed to be on tonight,

66
00:07:01,056 --> 00:07:04,091
but you think it'd be okay
if I cut out a little early?

67
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,058
Say what?!

68
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:07,661
Can I cut out
a little early tonight?

69
00:07:07,729 --> 00:07:10,013
How early? I don't know.

70
00:07:11,665 --> 00:07:12,431
Early.

71
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,718
So I gotta stay late and close?

72
00:07:14,785 --> 00:07:17,170
Can I go? Who is she?

73
00:07:18,505 --> 00:07:19,773
Come on, Uncle Duane.

74
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,557
Come on. Come on. Come on.

75
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:22,908
Who's the lucky lady?

76
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:24,377
Can I go?

77
00:07:24,445 --> 00:07:26,678
Don't hold out on me, man.

78
00:07:26,746 --> 00:07:29,080
You're asking me
for a favor, so...

79
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,417
Who is she?

80
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:34,319
Her name's Sarah.

81
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,123
Sarah.

82
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:40,891
Dre!

83
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:41,926
Whoo!

84
00:07:42,077 --> 00:07:43,344
Ha ha!

85
00:07:43,412 --> 00:07:44,611
Sarah.

86
00:07:44,679 --> 00:07:46,530
That's a nice name.

87
00:07:46,598 --> 00:07:49,066
That's a nice name.

88
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,142
Go on. I'll see you
after school.

89
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,143
Uh, what about...

90
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:01,228
Go on. Go on, Ray.

91
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:09,403
Out the back way. Out the back.

92
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,503
Brother got a .22 out.

93
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,755
What you mean?

94
00:08:12,823 --> 00:08:14,406
Drop that nigger, bro.

95
00:08:14,474 --> 00:08:16,875
Just, like,
rolled up on that ass.

96
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,632
Gonna roll up and shoot
that game and shit.

97
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,667
Ribs ready yet?

98
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:28,652
Just started the fire.
We open at 11:00.

99
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,154
Hey, come on, bro.
I'm hungry, cuz.

100
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:31,873
Y'all ain't got
nothin' back there?

101
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,126
Come back later. I'll have
something for you then.

102
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:38,396
Why don't you go
fetch me some chips,

103
00:08:38,464 --> 00:08:39,797
a couple cokes.

104
00:08:54,529 --> 00:08:55,861
Keep the change.

105
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,348
Let's get out of here.

106
00:08:59,883 --> 00:09:01,951
Fuck is you looking at?

107
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,941
Now, everyone has
to get these exams signed

108
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:11,976
by a parent or guardian, okay?

109
00:09:12,044 --> 00:09:14,746
Those of you with exceptions
know who you are,

110
00:09:14,814 --> 00:09:16,248
but unfortunately,

111
00:09:16,315 --> 00:09:20,885
some of you will be back
again for another semester,

112
00:09:20,953 --> 00:09:23,871
and some of you will be needing
to go to the front office

113
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:28,375
to pick up your cap and gown
for graduation next week.

114
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:30,211
Congratulations.

115
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,552
Hi.

116
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,287
What are you doing here?

117
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:42,488
I live here. Heh.

118
00:09:42,556 --> 00:09:43,656
You pay rent here,

119
00:09:43,724 --> 00:09:45,558
but you don't
exactly live here.

120
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,026
I forgot my key.

121
00:09:47,094 --> 00:09:48,561
Okay.

122
00:09:48,628 --> 00:09:50,429
I'm leaving him, so...

123
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:52,264
You took his cat?

124
00:09:52,332 --> 00:09:53,432
Yes.

125
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:56,401
Can I come in?

126
00:09:56,468 --> 00:09:58,553
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

127
00:09:58,588 --> 00:10:00,222
Come in.

128
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:03,658
Oh, wow. Okay.

129
00:10:04,727 --> 00:10:06,127
Why?

130
00:10:06,195 --> 00:10:10,598
Well, I just don't think
he deserves the cat.

131
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,866
Like, he doesn't
take care of her.

132
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,602
He never cleans her litter box.

133
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,870
She's always hungry.

134
00:10:15,937 --> 00:10:18,306
No, no, no. I mean with
you and Michael. Why?

135
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:25,978
He's just...

136
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:29,716
Nothing's ever
gonna change, you know?

137
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,651
I mean,
he's never gonna change.

138
00:10:31,719 --> 00:10:34,287
There are all these girls,
and they just...

139
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:38,825
I just feel really stupid.
That's all.

140
00:10:38,891 --> 00:10:41,494
Well, I hate to say
that I told you so.

141
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,115
I just wish I didn't
love him so much.

142
00:10:47,183 --> 00:10:49,818
You need him...

143
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:52,471
But you wish you
didn't need him so much.

144
00:10:52,539 --> 00:10:55,506
Nobody loves anyone that treats
them that badly. Coffee?

145
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:57,842
Is that the strongest
thing we have?

146
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,760
At this hour, yeah.

147
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,401
When... when was this?

148
00:11:07,469 --> 00:11:08,835
Last weekend.

149
00:11:08,903 --> 00:11:11,638
I called you, but you were
out with the man-whore.

150
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:13,256
I'm such an idiot.

151
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:14,257
Mm-hmm.

152
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:21,064
Well, you're better off
without him.

153
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:25,985
I wish I could stay, but I
gotta go to class, so...

154
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,587
No, that's fine.

155
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:29,755
Just gonna be sitting here,

156
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,157
watching soap operas
and wallowing.

157
00:11:32,225 --> 00:11:34,727
Okay, maybe I should stay.

158
00:11:34,794 --> 00:11:36,762
No, you're fine. Go.

159
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,196
I know. Tonight we'll go out,

160
00:11:39,264 --> 00:11:41,633
and we'll have some fun, and
we'll forget all about it.

161
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,385
Yeah.

162
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,455
I'll call you after class.

163
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:49,391
Yeah. All right.

164
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,458
Hang in there.

165
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:45,225
Mom?

166
00:13:17,641 --> 00:13:18,974
Hi, mom.

167
00:13:20,443 --> 00:13:21,277
Where you been?

168
00:13:21,344 --> 00:13:23,344
Boy, where you think I've been?

169
00:13:24,813 --> 00:13:27,582
I don't know.
That's why I asked.

170
00:13:29,084 --> 00:13:30,752
None of your goddamn business

171
00:13:30,819 --> 00:13:32,970
is where I've been,
you little bitch.

172
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:35,773
Keep that shit down.
I need some sleep.

173
00:13:35,841 --> 00:13:37,024
Where have I been?

174
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,326
Fuck you. Fuck you!

175
00:13:41,929 --> 00:13:43,213
Shit!

176
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,798
- Holy shit.
- Shh.

177
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,766
Be cool. It's okay.

178
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:46,733
How the fuck is that?

179
00:13:46,801 --> 00:13:48,318
You just shot her
in the fucking face.

180
00:13:48,386 --> 00:13:50,053
Are you out of
your fucking mind, Kevin?

181
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,638
Come on. She was
making a scene.

182
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:52,938
And what do you think this is?!

183
00:13:53,005 --> 00:13:54,105
What do you think this is?!

184
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:56,074
It's okay.

185
00:13:56,142 --> 00:13:59,327
Man, shut her the fuck up!
goddamn!

186
00:13:59,395 --> 00:14:00,479
Yo, put that out
of her face, okay?!

187
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,715
You just freaking out!
Chill the fuck out!

188
00:14:02,782 --> 00:14:04,766
Fuck you care about
these bitches?

189
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:06,118
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

190
00:14:06,186 --> 00:14:07,669
I'm trying to get this
under control, okay,

191
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:10,405
so sit back and shut the
fuck up for a second.

192
00:14:10,472 --> 00:14:13,641
It's okay. Shh. It's okay. Shh.

193
00:14:17,896 --> 00:14:19,831
We could get her to a hospital.

194
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:21,182
We need to get her...

195
00:14:21,249 --> 00:14:22,916
What the fuck did I tell you?

196
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:25,736
Shut the fuck up! God.

197
00:14:27,922 --> 00:14:29,673
" My chick and the cold beer. "

198
00:14:29,675 --> 00:14:31,741
" Come and throw
kegs on me... "

199
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:32,776
That's it.

200
00:14:32,844 --> 00:14:34,044
" Blow your whole set, "

201
00:14:34,112 --> 00:14:35,729
" niggas try to get
the best of me. "

202
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:37,096
" Didn't succeed. "

203
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:38,797
" Tey wound up
in the chesapeake. "

204
00:14:38,865 --> 00:14:41,000
" 20 sucking chests at sea, "

205
00:14:41,068 --> 00:14:42,401
" see, you neglect the beef. "

206
00:14:42,403 --> 00:14:43,720
" Don't disrespect this heat. "

207
00:14:43,787 --> 00:14:45,004
" Somebody, here it come, "

208
00:14:45,071 --> 00:14:46,806
" have a nigga rest in peace. "

209
00:14:46,873 --> 00:14:48,324
" We never left the streets, "

210
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:49,976
" just nothin' left to eat, "

211
00:14:50,043 --> 00:14:51,693
" so I made
some new connections, "

212
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:53,161
" to connect the streets. "

213
00:14:53,229 --> 00:14:55,947
" We own that
through the South and the West. "

214
00:14:56,015 --> 00:14:57,131
" Save it all for the get. "

215
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,866
" Nigga, now we get respect. "

216
00:14:58,934 --> 00:15:00,252
" Yeah, we in the 'hood, "

217
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:01,870
" where the drama take place. "

218
00:15:01,937 --> 00:15:03,304
" So we trying to make moves, "

219
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,539
" so you better make way. "

220
00:15:04,607 --> 00:15:06,473
" You think you crunk
if you wanna, "

221
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,042
" fo' sure, you's a goner. "

222
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:09,676
" The pills and marijuana, "

223
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:11,194
" gonna last me to the summer. "

224
00:15:11,262 --> 00:15:13,663
" Yeah, we on the rise,
motherfuckin' 9 to 5. "

225
00:15:13,731 --> 00:15:15,799
Where the fuck are we?

226
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:18,235
What are you doing?

227
00:15:18,303 --> 00:15:20,604
What, you trying to draw
attention to us?

228
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,071
Fuck that.

229
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:24,173
Do you see people
bouncing to hip-hop

230
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,558
in this fucking neighborhood?

231
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,725
Turn that shit down.

232
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:28,227
What? We trying to blend in?

233
00:15:28,295 --> 00:15:30,780
I'm trying to get us the
fuck out of here, okay?

234
00:15:30,848 --> 00:15:33,299
We're in the land of fucking
Mayberry right now,

235
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:34,784
and you're blasting
dumb-ass music.

236
00:15:34,851 --> 00:15:36,835
Sit back, and turn
that shit down.

237
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,758
All the way down.

238
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:48,397
Man, what is that?

239
00:15:48,464 --> 00:15:49,214
What?

240
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:52,049
That Mayfair Huckleberry shit?

241
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:53,317
From old fucking reruns.

242
00:15:53,384 --> 00:15:55,720
Fuck kind of question is that?

243
00:15:55,787 --> 00:15:58,155
Just sit back and fucking look
for signs for the highway

244
00:15:58,223 --> 00:15:59,523
so we can get this girl
to the hospital.

245
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,292
What? No fucking way.

246
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,327
We're not going
to the fucking hospital.

247
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:04,645
Okay, what? You want
to let this girl

248
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,029
bleed to death in the
back of the fucking car?

249
00:16:06,097 --> 00:16:07,297
Is that your fucking
plan, genius?

250
00:16:07,365 --> 00:16:08,731
It's better than showing up

251
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:09,782
with a half-dead chick,

252
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,851
just begging the cops
to bag us.

253
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:16,456
I ain't about to go to
fucking jail for this shit.

254
00:16:18,292 --> 00:16:19,976
What's going on back there?

255
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:21,143
Man, sit up!

256
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,695
Will you put the gun down?

257
00:16:22,846 --> 00:16:24,630
How many times
I gotta tell you?

258
00:16:24,698 --> 00:16:25,647
Damn it.

259
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:29,301
It's okay.

260
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:31,654
What the fuck are you doing?

261
00:16:31,721 --> 00:16:33,622
I'm just trying
to stop the bleeding.

262
00:16:34,857 --> 00:16:36,507
Just put it down.

263
00:16:36,575 --> 00:16:37,575
Let her bleed.

264
00:16:37,642 --> 00:16:39,811
Let her do it.

265
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:45,449
You go ahead.

266
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:50,854
But the court struck
down the death penalty

267
00:16:50,921 --> 00:16:53,373
in Kennedy vs. Louisiana
because it was not

268
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,524
a proportional reaction
to rape,

269
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:56,310
not because it was
cruel and unusual.

270
00:16:56,377 --> 00:16:57,778
Yes, but the court
explicitly cited

271
00:16:57,845 --> 00:16:59,946
a national consensus
against the death penalty

272
00:17:00,214 --> 00:17:01,465
as a basis for their decision.

273
00:17:01,532 --> 00:17:03,300
A national consensus
in rape cases only,

274
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,534
a premise, by the way,

275
00:17:04,686 --> 00:17:06,535
which the dissenting option
clearly discredited.

276
00:17:06,603 --> 00:17:09,522
The point is there are some
crimes so heinous in nature,

277
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,191
they not only deserve, but they
demand the ultimate punishment.

278
00:17:12,493 --> 00:17:14,026
A punishment that is so
heinous in and of itself

279
00:17:14,093 --> 00:17:16,294
that almost all the Western nations
have outlawed it completely.

280
00:17:16,362 --> 00:17:17,947
Why do you guys think it is

281
00:17:18,014 --> 00:17:19,281
that the U.K.,
Germany, Spain, France

282
00:17:19,348 --> 00:17:20,782
and most of the civilized world

283
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,433
have deemed capital
punishment cruel and unusual?

284
00:17:22,618 --> 00:17:23,702
Because they're wrong.

285
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:24,786
Welcome, Mr. Hastings.

286
00:17:24,853 --> 00:17:25,987
Please come join your team.

287
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:27,989
Oh. Sleeping beauty awakens.

288
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:29,541
Proportionality is
the determining factor,

289
00:17:29,608 --> 00:17:31,525
as was stated in
Kennedy vs. Louisiana.

290
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:33,495
And the death penalty
as it applies to murder

291
00:17:33,562 --> 00:17:34,395
is completely proportional

292
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,895
and therefore
totally acceptable.

293
00:17:35,963 --> 00:17:38,749
Guys, you're not dealing
with the issue of morality.

294
00:17:38,934 --> 00:17:42,052
If we as a society believe that
it is morally wrong to murder,

295
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:44,154
then how can we turn around
and murder someone

296
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,389
in the name of morality?

297
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:46,640
Because it's a bigger
issue than that.

298
00:17:46,708 --> 00:17:48,258
We're talking
about murder here.

299
00:17:48,326 --> 00:17:50,009
The punishment has to be
as serious as the crime.

300
00:17:50,077 --> 00:17:51,027
We have to govern by example.

301
00:17:51,178 --> 00:17:52,562
Someone that needs
to be shown by example

302
00:17:52,629 --> 00:17:54,363
that it's wrong to kill
doesn't deserve to live.

303
00:17:54,598 --> 00:17:57,816
Spoken like the narrow-minded
son of privilege that you are.

304
00:17:57,884 --> 00:17:59,435
Okay, privileged or not,

305
00:17:59,503 --> 00:18:01,771
when you're born into this
world, you're given a ticket,

306
00:18:01,839 --> 00:18:04,273
a free pass that says
you're free to eat,

307
00:18:04,575 --> 00:18:06,224
breathe and pursue whatever
you want in this life,

308
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,993
but there is one thing
that you cannot do.

309
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,528
And if you choose to do it,
you turn in your ticket,

310
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,230
and when you get caught
without a ticket,

311
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:13,865
you get kicked off the ride.

312
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,934
That's what I'm saying.
Get 'em on up out of here.

313
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:19,121
Okay, okay. Settle.

314
00:18:19,188 --> 00:18:20,520
Look, we're out of time,

315
00:18:20,588 --> 00:18:22,389
but we're gonna come back
with these same teams

316
00:18:22,457 --> 00:18:25,292
next class, focusing
on the moral issue,

317
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,993
not just legal precedent.

318
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:28,061
And, Mr. Hastings,

319
00:18:28,129 --> 00:18:29,896
please try to be on time.

320
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:32,767
Dre.

321
00:18:32,834 --> 00:18:34,567
Hey.

322
00:18:34,635 --> 00:18:35,234
Hey.

323
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:36,987
So what happened?

324
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:39,739
What?

325
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,177
Oh, my God.

326
00:18:45,245 --> 00:18:46,896
Oh, my God.
I'm so proud of you.

327
00:18:46,964 --> 00:18:47,881
Can't believe it.

328
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:49,297
I mean, you studied
your ass off

329
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:50,632
for that thing.
Are you kidding me?

330
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,284
I know. I'm gonna graduate.

331
00:18:52,351 --> 00:18:53,819
- You know?
- I know.

332
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:54,853
Oh, my God. Okay.

333
00:18:55,005 --> 00:18:57,272
So let's celebrate tonight,
just me and you.

334
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,490
We have to do something.

335
00:18:58,558 --> 00:19:00,442
- I can't.
- What do you mean?

336
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:04,478
I told the guys that I was
gonna meet up with them.

337
00:19:04,546 --> 00:19:06,263
- What are you doing, Dre?
- What?

338
00:19:06,331 --> 00:19:08,182
What are you doing?

339
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:09,166
Keisha, come on.

340
00:19:09,234 --> 00:19:10,467
You're better than all that.

341
00:19:10,535 --> 00:19:11,952
Look at how hard
you're working.

342
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,689
Look at where you're
headed, and look at them.

343
00:19:14,756 --> 00:19:16,557
Okay, those are
my family, okay?

344
00:19:16,624 --> 00:19:18,325
But you're not one of them.

345
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:19,375
They're all I've got, okay?

346
00:19:19,443 --> 00:19:21,061
No, they're not.

347
00:19:21,128 --> 00:19:24,214
Look, I just don't want to
see you throw your life away

348
00:19:24,281 --> 00:19:25,331
for a bunch of gangbangers

349
00:19:25,450 --> 00:19:27,351
who are so busy watching
their own backs,

350
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:28,618
they can't even see you.

351
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:29,869
You know I'm not
throwing away my life.

352
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:30,903
Look at this, right?

353
00:19:30,971 --> 00:19:33,223
- Okay, okay.
- Okay.

354
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,092
Okay, so... so are you
coming tonight?

355
00:19:36,159 --> 00:19:37,643
Keisha, I just told you I...

356
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,862
Andre, you gotta start
making some choices.

357
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,747
You can't keep walking
the middle line,

358
00:19:41,815 --> 00:19:43,298
'cause at some point
you're gonna fall

359
00:19:43,366 --> 00:19:45,233
to one side or the other.

360
00:19:45,301 --> 00:19:47,353
You keep hanging out
with them... Look at me.

361
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:48,903
You keep hanging out with them,

362
00:19:48,971 --> 00:19:50,905
and one day, you're gonna
get caught in something

363
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,157
that's gonna undo
all that you're doing.

364
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:54,893
Then it's in God's hands.

365
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,461
I can handle myself, okay?

366
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,230
These guys are from where I'm from.
You know that.

367
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:00,765
They're not where
you're from, Andre.

368
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,167
They're just where you've been.

369
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,056
I'm gonna call you later, okay?

370
00:20:09,123 --> 00:20:10,557
No, I know.

371
00:20:10,624 --> 00:20:11,608
All right.

372
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:15,228
Hey, Mussolini.

373
00:20:15,296 --> 00:20:17,030
What's up, flower power?

374
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:18,031
Nice job today.

375
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:19,565
If only you were right,

376
00:20:19,632 --> 00:20:21,567
things would have
gone so much better.

377
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:25,304
Maybe if my teammate wouldn't
have made your point for you.

378
00:20:25,371 --> 00:20:26,906
Eh, he's an idiot.

379
00:20:26,973 --> 00:20:29,641
Oh, he drives me crazy.

380
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,110
Really?

381
00:20:31,178 --> 00:20:33,678
Not like that. Eww.

382
00:20:33,746 --> 00:20:34,946
Are you blushing?

383
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:36,848
I do not blush.

384
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:37,949
Oh. That's right.

385
00:20:38,017 --> 00:20:38,917
You a tough girl.

386
00:20:38,985 --> 00:20:41,503
And don't you forget it.

387
00:20:41,571 --> 00:20:44,139
So you coming out tonight?

388
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:45,673
No, I don't think so.

389
00:20:45,741 --> 00:20:47,476
Um, I got a lot of work to do.

390
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:49,543
School's almost over.
You should come out,

391
00:20:49,611 --> 00:20:51,278
- have a little fun.
- I can't.

392
00:20:51,346 --> 00:20:54,815
Oh. You're afraid I'm gonna
kick your ass in darts again.

393
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:57,284
What?! That was me
kicking your ass

394
00:20:57,352 --> 00:20:58,419
in darts last weekend.

395
00:20:58,487 --> 00:21:00,121
That's not how I remember it.

396
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:01,655
I think you're trying to appeal

397
00:21:01,723 --> 00:21:03,123
to my competitive nature.

398
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,640
Is it working?

399
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,691
A little bit.

400
00:21:05,759 --> 00:21:06,626
All right.

401
00:21:06,693 --> 00:21:08,110
- You did it.
- I did.

402
00:21:08,178 --> 00:21:09,311
You are bold, girl.

403
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,480
When you know what you want,

404
00:21:10,547 --> 00:21:12,081
you just gotta
go for it, right?

405
00:21:12,148 --> 00:21:13,966
Hey, guys.

406
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:14,884
Hey, Carley. Hi.

407
00:21:14,952 --> 00:21:17,787
Shit. Girl, you got
more books in your arms

408
00:21:17,854 --> 00:21:19,538
than I've read all year.

409
00:21:19,605 --> 00:21:21,823
Carley didn't get the memo
that school's almost out.

410
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:23,374
If the memo you're talking
about is a degree

411
00:21:23,442 --> 00:21:24,809
that reads summa cum laude,

412
00:21:24,877 --> 00:21:27,146
then, no, I haven't
gotten it. Yet.

413
00:21:28,414 --> 00:21:29,947
Are you still working
on your thesis?

414
00:21:30,015 --> 00:21:30,966
Day and night, yep.

415
00:21:31,033 --> 00:21:32,350
Gotta make daddy proud, right?

416
00:21:32,418 --> 00:21:34,935
No wonder you never get laid.

417
00:21:36,121 --> 00:21:37,754
I am single by choice.

418
00:21:37,822 --> 00:21:41,308
That's her line, and
she's sticking to it.

419
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,693
Oh, is this your show?

420
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,928
Yeah. It's tomorrow,
so you better be there.

421
00:21:44,996 --> 00:21:47,298
No excuses about a
thesis or some bullshit.

422
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,319
That is not true!

423
00:22:45,470 --> 00:22:46,985
What happened?

424
00:22:48,855 --> 00:22:52,458
I never should have gotten
out of bed this morning.

425
00:22:53,726 --> 00:22:55,761
I saw you running out
of the student center.

426
00:22:55,828 --> 00:22:56,762
I...

427
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:57,763
God.

428
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,690
What's going on?

429
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:12,160
Michael was in there
with some girl.

430
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:14,312
Already.

431
00:23:17,732 --> 00:23:20,133
Why didn't you say something?

432
00:23:20,201 --> 00:23:22,168
I...

433
00:23:22,236 --> 00:23:24,655
What... I don't know.

434
00:23:25,974 --> 00:23:30,660
And I'm just
completely paralyzed

435
00:23:30,728 --> 00:23:33,662
by the thought of him
not loving me.

436
00:23:34,447 --> 00:23:35,898
Hey. Come here.

437
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,169
Get your hands up!

438
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,204
Get down!

439
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,988
- Come on, man!
- Get down!

440
00:24:01,056 --> 00:24:02,156
Get off me, man.

441
00:24:02,223 --> 00:24:03,607
I didn't even do anything!

442
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,844
Shut the fuck up.
What is this shit?

443
00:24:07,045 --> 00:24:08,862
What the fuck you think it is?
Books, man.

444
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,148
Fuck I think it is? You
gonna get smart with me?

445
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:12,500
Shut the fuck up!

446
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:13,684
You little smartass.

447
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:15,452
Where you going?

448
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,335
I'm going home, man.

449
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:17,721
Home? Where you live?

450
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:19,623
I live up the block, man.
This is bullshit.

451
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,357
I didn't even do anything.
Get off me.

452
00:24:21,425 --> 00:24:24,661
We didn't ask you did you
do something, smartass.

453
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:26,079
Get the fuck off me, man.

454
00:24:27,748 --> 00:24:29,231
He's clean.

455
00:24:29,299 --> 00:24:31,216
Let his bitch ass up.

456
00:24:31,284 --> 00:24:33,952
Get off the streets, boy.

457
00:25:24,534 --> 00:25:25,935
Yaah!

458
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:41,399
Where's your mom?

459
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:42,967
Sleeping.

460
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,236
Where are your manners, boy?

461
00:25:46,304 --> 00:25:47,971
Get out of my way.

462
00:25:51,042 --> 00:25:52,859
Come on, man. She's sleeping.

463
00:25:53,945 --> 00:25:56,046
And what are you gonna do, boy?

464
00:25:57,515 --> 00:25:59,082
You gonna stop me?

465
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:02,851
Why don't you go out and play
with your little boyfriends.

466
00:26:02,919 --> 00:26:03,953
Heh. Go.

467
00:26:25,607 --> 00:26:27,242
Hi.

468
00:26:57,371 --> 00:26:58,655
What?

469
00:27:01,557 --> 00:27:03,792
Tokyo?

470
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:07,045
Well, did you tell them that...

471
00:27:11,884 --> 00:27:14,618
Yeah. Everything else
is going really good.

472
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:20,290
I haven't really talked
to missy in a while, dad.

473
00:27:21,726 --> 00:27:23,928
Dad, um...

474
00:27:25,197 --> 00:27:28,232
It would really mean a
lot to me if there was...

475
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,334
If there was any way that you
could... you would come here,

476
00:27:31,402 --> 00:27:34,037
because, you know, I only
graduate once, and...

477
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:39,842
Well, law school
is a long way away.

478
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,463
Um...

479
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,648
Dad, you've never
even visited me

480
00:27:46,716 --> 00:27:49,218
this entire time
that I was here,

481
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:52,288
so, I mean, is this meeting
really that important?

482
00:27:59,194 --> 00:28:00,494
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

483
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:01,980
No, I totally understand.

484
00:28:05,067 --> 00:28:08,036
Okay. Okay, call me back.

485
00:28:24,785 --> 00:28:27,020
Fuck this.

486
00:28:31,591 --> 00:28:33,993
Max. Hey.

487
00:28:34,061 --> 00:28:38,281
Heh. You feel like getting your
ass kicked at darts again?

488
00:28:38,348 --> 00:28:40,599
It is so on.

489
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:43,219
No. Nah, nah.

490
00:28:43,286 --> 00:28:45,686
You're gonna have to
rewind it, run that back.

491
00:28:45,755 --> 00:28:47,521
Ain't no way
it went down like that.

492
00:28:47,589 --> 00:28:48,790
Nigger, I ain't bullshitting.

493
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:51,626
There I was minding
my own fucking business,

494
00:28:51,693 --> 00:28:53,628
and she walk up butt-ass naked.

495
00:28:53,695 --> 00:28:55,363
- No drawers at all?
- No drawers.

496
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,999
Damn, boy, why shit like
this don't happen to me?

497
00:28:58,067 --> 00:28:59,733
'Cause you ain't
got no swag, nigger.

498
00:28:59,801 --> 00:29:00,901
Swag. You know it.

499
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:03,503
- I got swag.
- What... Your girl just a ho.

500
00:29:03,571 --> 00:29:04,838
Yo, what up, wigger?

501
00:29:04,906 --> 00:29:06,173
What you doing round here?

502
00:29:06,241 --> 00:29:07,791
Yeah, ain't you supposed
to be in school?

503
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:09,309
School is for pussies.

504
00:29:09,377 --> 00:29:11,729
Why don't you go grab
me a beer or something?

505
00:29:11,796 --> 00:29:13,412
Why don't you go
grab yourself one?

506
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,247
Listen to the little tough man.

507
00:29:15,315 --> 00:29:17,083
Man, why you always
calling me little,

508
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:19,018
like I'm 12 or some shit?

509
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,786
'Cause you look like
you 12 or some shit.

510
00:29:20,854 --> 00:29:22,438
- I'm not a kid.
- Is that right?

511
00:29:22,506 --> 00:29:25,641
Just as tough as any
of you motherfuckers.

512
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:29,461
Oh, you want to be
a gangster now, huh?

513
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:32,430
Yeah, y'all just won't let
me in 'cause I'm white.

514
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:33,781
Hey, that's bullshit.

515
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:35,734
See, we an equal-opportunity
street crew around here.

516
00:29:35,801 --> 00:29:38,152
And I know Dre daddy
a cracker just like you,

517
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:41,473
and, see, Keith, he got some
chink in him, don't you, Keith?

518
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,507
Shut the fuck up.

519
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:44,758
So then why not let me in?

520
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,493
Yo, this ain't playtime, man.

521
00:29:46,561 --> 00:29:48,762
This shit here is for real.

522
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,213
Yo, J.J., what about Dre?

523
00:29:50,232 --> 00:29:52,048
Fuck Dre.

524
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:56,654
Go on.

525
00:30:09,783 --> 00:30:11,818
Another time.

526
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:16,171
Pshew pshew.

527
00:30:16,239 --> 00:30:17,473
25 points.

528
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,673
What?

529
00:30:18,741 --> 00:30:20,742
You know, shooting a cop.
25 points.

530
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:24,413
Damn. I mean, I think that
at least be like 50 points

531
00:30:24,547 --> 00:30:25,998
or something like that,
bro. Come on.

532
00:30:26,065 --> 00:30:27,999
Nah, nigger, 25.
You trippin', man.

533
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:29,800
Hell you thinking 'bout?

534
00:30:29,868 --> 00:30:30,968
So that's it?

535
00:30:31,036 --> 00:30:31,902
I'm in now?

536
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:33,253
Nah. That's just us

537
00:30:33,355 --> 00:30:35,455
having some fun
whupping your ass.

538
00:30:35,523 --> 00:30:37,358
Come on, man.

539
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:38,792
What do I gotta do?

540
00:30:38,861 --> 00:30:41,562
Why don't you go steal us
a car or something, bro?

541
00:30:41,629 --> 00:30:45,098
Yeah. Matter of fact,

542
00:30:45,166 --> 00:30:46,900
why don't you go steal
your daddy's ride?

543
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:48,802
He's not my fucking daddy.

544
00:30:48,869 --> 00:30:50,820
Look, you ain't got no daddy,

545
00:30:50,888 --> 00:30:52,989
so whoever fucking
your mama right now,

546
00:30:53,057 --> 00:30:55,274
not including myself, that's
your daddy right now.

547
00:30:55,342 --> 00:30:56,293
Man, fuck you!

548
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:59,611
Yo, ease up. Ease the fuck off.

549
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,530
Okay, okay,

550
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:03,832
go get your
not-your-daddy's car then.

551
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,517
And then I'm in?

552
00:31:05,585 --> 00:31:07,753
Patience, kid.

553
00:31:07,821 --> 00:31:09,254
One step at a time, homeboy.

554
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:11,723
I don't know if I can.

555
00:31:11,791 --> 00:31:13,908
Oh, you so gangster now, you can't
even go get your daddy keys?

556
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:15,276
I could get 'em!

557
00:31:15,344 --> 00:31:18,329
Get the fuck out of here. Go.

558
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:21,483
Hey, yo, your boy wilding, bro.

559
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:25,336
You not gonna let him in
for real, is you, brah?

560
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:26,204
Hell, nah.

561
00:31:26,272 --> 00:31:28,405
Just fucking with
the white boy.

562
00:31:29,774 --> 00:31:31,942
Pow pow!

563
00:31:34,545 --> 00:31:36,563
50 points.

564
00:31:41,552 --> 00:31:42,351
How's she doing?

565
00:31:43,837 --> 00:31:46,438
She really needs
to get to a hospital.

566
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,108
What's your name?

567
00:31:53,596 --> 00:31:54,680
Carley.

568
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:57,232
Carley, you know where we are?

569
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,483
Yeah.

570
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:03,238
You want to let us know how
to get out of here, Carley?

571
00:32:07,393 --> 00:32:08,410
I don't know.

572
00:32:08,477 --> 00:32:10,344
What do you mean
you don't know?

573
00:32:10,412 --> 00:32:13,029
You're gonna tell us how to
get the fuck out of here.

574
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:15,416
Would you shut
the fuck up, Kevin?

575
00:32:15,483 --> 00:32:17,968
Seriously, Carley, we
don't want to get this

576
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:20,420
any more fucked up than
it already is, do we?

577
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:22,406
Are you gonna take her
to a hospital?

578
00:32:22,474 --> 00:32:25,175
I need you to tell me
where the highway is.

579
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,676
She really needs
to get to a doctor.

580
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,928
That wasn't my fucking
question, now, was it?

581
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,014
I don't think
that had anything to do

582
00:32:31,081 --> 00:32:32,649
with what you were asking her.

583
00:32:42,008 --> 00:32:44,342
Carley.

584
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:47,312
Just, um... Just go up here.

585
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,164
If you keep going straight,

586
00:32:49,199 --> 00:32:50,999
the highway's on the left.

587
00:32:51,234 --> 00:32:53,569
You'll see the sign
to the hospital.

588
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:55,220
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

589
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:57,071
What the fuck we listening
to this bitch for?

590
00:32:57,139 --> 00:32:58,672
She don't know shit.

591
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,990
Why you acting like you know

592
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:01,158
when you don't know shit?

593
00:33:01,226 --> 00:33:03,560
You know, don't you, Carley?

594
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,180
Yeah. It's... It's up here.

595
00:33:06,298 --> 00:33:08,565
You best not be messing
with us, girl.

596
00:33:08,633 --> 00:33:09,399
Thank you.

597
00:33:09,467 --> 00:33:11,517
Thank you very much, Carley.

598
00:33:15,339 --> 00:33:16,505
Yeah.

599
00:33:16,573 --> 00:33:18,224
Dumb bitch.

600
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:20,576
Man, look for the signs.

601
00:33:22,162 --> 00:33:25,131
Man, I ain't ever
seen any of this shit.

602
00:33:28,568 --> 00:33:31,236
I don't know
where the fuck we are.

603
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:33,972
I'm supposed to be
at dad's right now.

604
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:48,068
" ...ball, motherf..."

605
00:33:48,136 --> 00:33:49,304
" Test, motherf..."

606
00:33:49,371 --> 00:33:52,557
" Club up, ah, yeah,
'bout to clown. "

607
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,125
" On the town. "

608
00:33:54,192 --> 00:33:57,644
" Start off at the shot
that came down. "

609
00:33:57,711 --> 00:33:59,212
" I got you up always. "

610
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:01,081
" I got you crunk always. "

611
00:34:01,149 --> 00:34:02,682
" I got the dance club. "

612
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,234
" Club up all day... "

613
00:34:04,252 --> 00:34:06,870
Man, why they gotta do that?

614
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,004
What?

615
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:11,557
Cut off the lyrics of the song.

616
00:34:11,624 --> 00:34:14,143
It's the radio.

617
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,162
I know, but...

618
00:34:16,229 --> 00:34:20,616
He chose that word to
express himself, you know.

619
00:34:20,684 --> 00:34:22,451
They shouldn't be able
to do that, man.

620
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:25,037
They just trying to keep the
track from being heard.

621
00:34:26,305 --> 00:34:29,240
Hey, Kevin, you know what?
Then buy the fucking cd,

622
00:34:29,308 --> 00:34:31,443
and you get all the
self-expression you want.

623
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,344
I will, fool.

624
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:35,113
Seriously, turn this shit down.

625
00:34:35,181 --> 00:34:37,281
Man, why?

626
00:34:37,583 --> 00:34:38,917
'Cause I'm trying
to fucking think, okay?

627
00:34:38,984 --> 00:34:40,234
You got me in this
fucking situation.

628
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:41,318
Turn this shit down.

629
00:34:41,385 --> 00:34:43,069
I'm trying to think.

630
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,242
I don't know why I have to tell
you so many fucking times.

631
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:51,178
I turned it down, all right?

632
00:35:13,499 --> 00:35:14,599
Come on.

633
00:35:15,250 --> 00:35:17,435
I really just want to go home.

634
00:35:17,503 --> 00:35:19,187
You've had the shittiest
day on record.

635
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:21,206
I'm not gonna let it
end this way.

636
00:35:21,274 --> 00:35:22,340
You need a beer.

637
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:24,342
Can't believe I wrecked my car.

638
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:26,343
Oh, you should have
seen the tree.

639
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:27,861
Come on. Let's go.

640
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:31,582
He's gonna show up here at
some point with that girl.

641
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,983
Exactly.

642
00:35:33,051 --> 00:35:34,401
This should be fun.

643
00:35:36,087 --> 00:35:37,788
Rach, what are
you talking about?

644
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,073
We're gonna go bust
Mike's next date.

645
00:35:40,141 --> 00:35:41,408
- No, we're not.
- Yes.

646
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,009
- No, we're not.
- Yes. It's payback time.

647
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:44,327
Please. Please, oh...

648
00:35:44,445 --> 00:35:47,163
You know, I have such a
bad feeling about this.

649
00:35:55,588 --> 00:35:56,789
Shit.

650
00:35:56,856 --> 00:35:58,323
I should have walked.

651
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,195
Fuck this.

652
00:36:39,262 --> 00:36:40,262
Fuck this.

653
00:36:42,065 --> 00:36:43,783
Fuck this.

654
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,917
Dre, what the fuck you doing?

655
00:36:44,985 --> 00:36:46,635
I'm taking her to the hospital.

656
00:36:46,703 --> 00:36:49,372
You're gonna make us go to
prison for the rest of our lives

657
00:36:49,439 --> 00:36:50,806
just so she can go
to the hospital?

658
00:36:50,873 --> 00:36:52,324
I'm not letting her
die in here! You hear me?

659
00:36:52,392 --> 00:36:53,492
She's gonna die anyway, Dre.

660
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:55,092
Not gonna let her die
in the fucking car!

661
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,745
Well, then let's
fucking dump her.

662
00:36:56,812 --> 00:36:58,630
We'll ice her fucking friend, too.
My God.

663
00:36:58,931 --> 00:37:00,999
Just let us out right here.
I swear to God you won't...

664
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:02,500
Shut up, bitch!

665
00:37:03,219 --> 00:37:05,353
What the fuck...

666
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,189
What the fuck are you doing?

667
00:37:09,257 --> 00:37:11,208
What the fuck did you do, girl?

668
00:37:11,275 --> 00:37:12,943
What the fuck is this?

669
00:37:13,011 --> 00:37:15,095
What the fuck is this?

670
00:37:15,163 --> 00:37:17,047
- Ah, shit.
- What?

671
00:37:17,115 --> 00:37:18,115
Shit.

672
00:37:18,183 --> 00:37:19,500
Man, what?

673
00:37:19,567 --> 00:37:20,901
It's a cop, man.

674
00:37:20,968 --> 00:37:22,352
Is it?

675
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,603
Oh, motherfucking bitch.

676
00:37:24,671 --> 00:37:25,638
Shit!

677
00:37:27,908 --> 00:37:30,042
Fuck! Oh, shit.

678
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:31,777
Okay. Shit.

679
00:37:31,844 --> 00:37:33,112
Carley, you fucked up!

680
00:37:34,665 --> 00:37:35,480
You fucked up!

681
00:37:35,799 --> 00:37:37,533
You just gotta floor it, Dre.

682
00:37:37,601 --> 00:37:38,900
Oh, yeah.
That's a fucking good idea,

683
00:37:39,002 --> 00:37:41,303
have a fucking full-on
police chase right now.

684
00:37:41,370 --> 00:37:42,754
You can't get pulled over, man.

685
00:37:42,922 --> 00:37:44,172
Look, we're not being
pulled over right now.

686
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,856
They just behind us,
so calm down.

687
00:37:45,924 --> 00:37:49,344
Don't do anything
else stupid, bitch.

688
00:37:49,412 --> 00:37:50,846
- God.
- I trusted you!

689
00:37:50,913 --> 00:37:53,165
Fuck! Fuck!

690
00:37:53,232 --> 00:37:56,100
I swear to God. Oh, God.

691
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:58,035
Kevin, stop looking back there.

692
00:37:58,103 --> 00:37:59,787
God.

693
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:00,921
Shit.

694
00:38:00,923 --> 00:38:03,056
Stop looking back there.

695
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:05,125
What the fuck
is this cop doing?

696
00:38:05,193 --> 00:38:06,527
He's just creeping on us, man.

697
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:09,579
Man, he's just
creeping there, Dre.

698
00:38:11,082 --> 00:38:12,748
I'm gonna turn off up here.

699
00:38:12,816 --> 00:38:13,883
Fuck, man.

700
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:15,902
Moment of truth.

701
00:38:24,627 --> 00:38:26,928
Ah, fuck.

702
00:38:49,918 --> 00:38:51,552
We can still go back.

703
00:39:04,315 --> 00:39:06,616
How the fuck did we get here?

704
00:39:06,683 --> 00:39:07,417
Ray!

705
00:39:07,484 --> 00:39:09,401
Got food stacking up here.

706
00:39:09,469 --> 00:39:10,735
Sorry. Sorry, man.

707
00:39:16,593 --> 00:39:17,676
Ray!

708
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:21,029
Yeah?

709
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:25,033
You can go now.

710
00:39:25,935 --> 00:39:27,152
Really?

711
00:39:27,219 --> 00:39:28,919
Yeah.

712
00:39:28,987 --> 00:39:30,605
Thanks, man.

713
00:39:30,673 --> 00:39:32,723
Hey, hey, little man,
little man.

714
00:39:33,759 --> 00:39:35,043
Uh...

715
00:39:39,414 --> 00:39:42,049
So you like this girl, huh?

716
00:39:42,116 --> 00:39:43,883
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

717
00:39:45,887 --> 00:39:47,086
You gonna kiss her?

718
00:39:47,154 --> 00:39:48,655
I don't know, Uncle Duane.

719
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,090
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

720
00:39:50,158 --> 00:39:51,090
I hope so.

721
00:39:51,158 --> 00:39:52,975
You hope so?

722
00:39:53,042 --> 00:39:54,326
Okay. Okay.

723
00:39:54,394 --> 00:39:56,361
You be a gentleman now.

724
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,197
Don't kiss her so hard
you scare her.

725
00:39:58,265 --> 00:40:00,549
Treat her with respect, and
she'll want to kiss you back.

726
00:40:00,617 --> 00:40:01,967
Know what I'm saying?

727
00:40:02,035 --> 00:40:03,853
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

728
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,372
All right.

729
00:40:09,442 --> 00:40:11,009
Little man Ray.

730
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,310
Sarah. Ha ha.

731
00:40:12,378 --> 00:40:14,979
Guess I need to call
you big man now, huh?

732
00:40:15,047 --> 00:40:16,148
Yeah.

733
00:40:16,215 --> 00:40:17,682
Go on. Have fun.

734
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,251
Hey, mama.

735
00:40:19,318 --> 00:40:21,253
Go easy on the cologne now.

736
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,369
Gotcha.

737
00:40:27,475 --> 00:40:30,043
I believe he gonna get it.
What you think?

738
00:40:30,111 --> 00:40:31,578
Man, he gonna do it, too.

739
00:40:31,646 --> 00:40:33,179
Look at that white boy.

740
00:40:33,247 --> 00:40:34,715
Hey, Rodger, grab me a beer.

741
00:40:34,783 --> 00:40:36,650
What the fuck I look like,

742
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:38,468
Geoffrey from the Fresh
Prince or some shit?

743
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,469
Yeah, nigger.

744
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,053
Look, look, you really do.

745
00:40:41,121 --> 00:40:42,222
Little bit, you do.

746
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:43,423
Get the fuck out.

747
00:40:43,490 --> 00:40:45,841
Yo, what up, Dre?

748
00:40:45,909 --> 00:40:48,061
How was school, dear?

749
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,412
Fuck you, Rodg.

750
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,497
Look. Oreo came to hang
with the niggers.

751
00:40:51,565 --> 00:40:53,131
Why, 'cause I'm the only one

752
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,483
of y'all motherfuckers
getting an education?

753
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:55,884
Hey, we educating our
motherfucking self

754
00:40:55,952 --> 00:40:56,918
around here, partner.

755
00:40:56,986 --> 00:40:58,020
Oh, yeah, Rodg?

756
00:40:58,087 --> 00:41:00,088
That's... that theory
working for y'all?

757
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:02,624
Yeah. It's
working out real good.

758
00:41:02,691 --> 00:41:04,759
I got my niggers,
and I got respect.

759
00:41:04,827 --> 00:41:06,495
Think your pussy ass
commanding respect

760
00:41:06,562 --> 00:41:08,562
packing Dr. Seuss
in your book bag?

761
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,514
What, you think
that thing on your waistband

762
00:41:10,582 --> 00:41:12,332
- gives you respect, J.J.?
- Yeah.

763
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,268
This piece gives me power,

764
00:41:14,335 --> 00:41:16,036
and power gets me respect.

765
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:18,422
Fear and respect are two
different things, brother.

766
00:41:19,657 --> 00:41:21,192
Let me learn you
something, nigger.

767
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:24,544
You may think you something
special, but you ain't shit.

768
00:41:24,611 --> 00:41:25,812
In the eyes of the world,

769
00:41:25,879 --> 00:41:27,630
there ain't no difference
between you and me.

770
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:29,782
So no matter what you do,

771
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,000
they ain't gonna
see you as nothin'

772
00:41:31,068 --> 00:41:33,970
but a gangbanger,
homeboy. Believe that.

773
00:41:34,037 --> 00:41:36,388
Hey, y'all got
some beers around here?

774
00:41:36,456 --> 00:41:38,774
Somebody get this pussy-ass
schoolboy a beer.

775
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:46,765
Hey, where Kevin off to?

776
00:41:49,402 --> 00:41:51,385
Where you got him going, J.J.?

777
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,004
Told him to go steal
his daddy's ride.

778
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:56,507
You know that's not
his daddy. Come on, man.

779
00:41:56,509 --> 00:41:57,624
Whatever.

780
00:41:57,692 --> 00:41:59,477
So, what? Y'all
letting him in now?

781
00:41:59,544 --> 00:42:00,828
He's gotta do
his initiation, bro.

782
00:42:00,896 --> 00:42:02,680
J.J., I thought
we talked about this.

783
00:42:02,748 --> 00:42:03,881
He's too young.

784
00:42:03,949 --> 00:42:04,749
Man, he's 16.

785
00:42:04,817 --> 00:42:07,267
Yeah, but he's not like us.

786
00:42:07,334 --> 00:42:09,369
Oh, now you and me
alike in some way.

787
00:42:09,436 --> 00:42:11,755
- I just thought we had a deal man.
- Fuck your deal, man.

788
00:42:11,822 --> 00:42:15,308
His big cousin wasn't
here to protect him.

789
00:42:15,376 --> 00:42:17,160
He was off at nursery school,

790
00:42:17,227 --> 00:42:18,811
and here we were.

791
00:42:21,481 --> 00:42:23,014
Hey, let me tear up
that black, nigger.

792
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:25,351
Hey, didn't you
smoke a cigarette?

793
00:42:25,418 --> 00:42:26,419
Walking cancer-ass nigger.

794
00:42:26,486 --> 00:42:28,420
Fuck you.

795
00:42:28,488 --> 00:42:30,222
Now will you get me a beer?

796
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,874
No, man.

797
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:43,968
You know, Dre,
I'm getting hungry.

798
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,052
What?

799
00:42:45,121 --> 00:42:46,287
I'm hungry.

800
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,923
How the fuck are you thinking
about food right now?

801
00:42:49,158 --> 00:42:51,024
I don't know. I'm just hungry.

802
00:42:51,092 --> 00:42:54,711
Okay, man, I'm looking for a way for
us to get the fuck out of here.

803
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:57,848
I told you
to go left back there.

804
00:42:57,915 --> 00:42:59,399
You know, Dre, seriously,
let's find a place.

805
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:01,168
What the fuck
are you talking about?

806
00:43:01,236 --> 00:43:03,470
I'll get directions.

807
00:43:03,538 --> 00:43:05,005
I'll be in and out real quick.

808
00:43:05,072 --> 00:43:07,139
I'll just get me a
Slushee or something.

809
00:43:07,207 --> 00:43:08,007
A Slushee?

810
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:10,476
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

811
00:43:10,544 --> 00:43:11,477
That's so nasty.

812
00:43:11,545 --> 00:43:14,880
All right, maybe a corn dog.

813
00:43:14,948 --> 00:43:17,116
Craving a corn dog
I could actually understand.

814
00:43:17,184 --> 00:43:19,819
At least it's got some
food value or something.

815
00:43:19,886 --> 00:43:21,787
What we gotta find's
a place we know.

816
00:43:21,821 --> 00:43:22,854
Yo, pull in up there.

817
00:43:22,922 --> 00:43:24,072
We're not stopping, Kevin.

818
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:27,108
You don't know where
the fuck we are.

819
00:43:27,176 --> 00:43:28,609
I'll get directions.

820
00:43:28,677 --> 00:43:30,712
Okay, man, if I pull in there,

821
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:33,114
you gotta be in and out.
That's it,

822
00:43:33,182 --> 00:43:34,282
and just get directions.

823
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:35,315
All right.

824
00:43:35,383 --> 00:43:37,117
I'm fucking serious, Kevin.

825
00:43:37,184 --> 00:43:38,853
I heard you.

826
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,087
All right.

827
00:43:45,143 --> 00:43:48,645
Hey, yo, pull up closer so I
don't have to walk so far.

828
00:43:48,713 --> 00:43:50,430
Go get directions,
okay, and hurry up.

829
00:43:52,683 --> 00:43:54,317
Hey, you want something?

830
00:43:54,385 --> 00:43:56,152
Just go. Go.

831
00:44:27,516 --> 00:44:28,916
You okay?

832
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:36,840
You don't have to do this.

833
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,044
You can make this stop.

834
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,111
Nah, I can't.

835
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,148
Yes, you can.

836
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:47,917
You can. You can just...

837
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:50,653
just let me take her
to a hospital.

838
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:51,987
Please.

839
00:44:54,424 --> 00:44:56,292
Look, it's a situation,

840
00:44:56,359 --> 00:44:59,244
but I'm gonna handle it.

841
00:45:01,948 --> 00:45:04,632
You guys are gonna
be okay. Just...

842
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:06,000
Take care of her, okay?

843
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:08,920
I can handle it. It'll be fine.

844
00:45:08,988 --> 00:45:11,939
He looks up to you.

845
00:45:14,860 --> 00:45:16,994
I swear to God
if you just let us go,

846
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:19,980
I won't say anything. You
won't get caught. I promise.

847
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,551
Yeah, why would you do that?

848
00:45:24,719 --> 00:45:26,820
Because...

849
00:45:26,938 --> 00:45:29,606
I think you got
caught in something

850
00:45:29,673 --> 00:45:31,975
that you don't know
how to get out of,

851
00:45:32,043 --> 00:45:35,644
and I think you're just
trying to save your friend.

852
00:45:36,947 --> 00:45:39,398
And I'm just trying
to save mine.

853
00:45:41,134 --> 00:45:43,002
Please don't let her die.

854
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,221
Please don't let her die.

855
00:45:50,826 --> 00:45:52,827
You have some I.D., son?

856
00:45:57,483 --> 00:46:01,336
Well, you're gonna need some I.D.
To buy alcohol.

857
00:46:01,404 --> 00:46:02,871
I'm 21.

858
00:46:02,938 --> 00:46:04,104
Yeah, well,

859
00:46:04,172 --> 00:46:06,440
I'm still gonna need
to see some I.D.

860
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:07,958
What are you laughing at?

861
00:46:08,793 --> 00:46:11,645
Do you want the rest
of the items?

862
00:46:11,712 --> 00:46:12,946
Son...

863
00:46:13,181 --> 00:46:14,732
I'm not your son.

864
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:18,235
Just shut up.
Shut the... get out, son.

865
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:21,103
Son, I can't sell you
beer without proper I.D.

866
00:46:21,238 --> 00:46:23,606
- I'm not your son.
- Do you want...

867
00:46:23,673 --> 00:46:24,523
...some of this, son?
No! Get out!

868
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:26,275
Stop! Get off her!

869
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,077
What do you think
you're doing? Get... son!

870
00:46:28,145 --> 00:46:29,896
Kevin, get out! You
piece of shit!

871
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:31,865
You want some of this?
Son, what did I just say?

872
00:46:31,932 --> 00:46:33,865
Get out. This is
not your business.

873
00:46:33,933 --> 00:46:35,900
I'll give you some of this.
Come on!

874
00:46:35,968 --> 00:46:37,669
Put the shit in the bag.

875
00:46:37,736 --> 00:46:39,838
O... okay, son. Just take it easy.

876
00:46:39,905 --> 00:46:41,640
Put the shit in the bag!

877
00:46:41,707 --> 00:46:43,142
Let's take it easy.

878
00:46:43,209 --> 00:46:44,209
Let's take it easy, all right?

879
00:46:44,277 --> 00:46:45,093
Okay. All right.

880
00:46:45,161 --> 00:46:46,361
Look at me!

881
00:46:46,429 --> 00:46:47,963
Kevin, get out. You
piece of shit!

882
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:48,863
Rodney, get the...

883
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:50,481
stay the fuck out of here.

884
00:46:50,549 --> 00:46:51,749
Rodney... you, shut up!

885
00:46:51,817 --> 00:46:52,749
Get back here!

886
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:54,152
Hurry up, old man!

887
00:46:54,219 --> 00:46:56,536
Just leave, okay, son, please.

888
00:46:56,604 --> 00:46:58,622
I'm not your fucking son!

889
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,440
Check your boy out.

890
00:47:00,508 --> 00:47:01,758
He all geeked up,

891
00:47:01,827 --> 00:47:03,459
like fixing to go wild.

892
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:07,663
He ain't about to do nothin'.

893
00:47:07,731 --> 00:47:08,932
I need a gun.

894
00:47:08,999 --> 00:47:10,800
What the fuck
you gonna do, nigger?

895
00:47:10,802 --> 00:47:11,751
What's going on, Kevin?

896
00:47:11,819 --> 00:47:13,236
I need a gun.

897
00:47:15,272 --> 00:47:18,140
Why don't we
start you off with this.

898
00:47:20,977 --> 00:47:22,427
It'll get the job done.

899
00:47:22,495 --> 00:47:24,429
Kevin. Kevin! Kevin!

900
00:47:25,915 --> 00:47:26,748
Shut the fucking door!

901
00:47:26,816 --> 00:47:28,817
Shut the door! Come on!

902
00:47:28,884 --> 00:47:30,970
Carley, you shut the door!

903
00:47:31,037 --> 00:47:33,054
Get in the car!

904
00:47:33,121 --> 00:47:34,855
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

905
00:47:49,553 --> 00:47:51,088
What happened?

906
00:47:54,491 --> 00:47:55,908
I didn't feel like paying.

907
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:57,327
You didn't feel like it?

908
00:47:58,812 --> 00:48:00,046
I mean, I was...

909
00:48:00,114 --> 00:48:02,698
So I'm standing there
with all this shit,

910
00:48:02,766 --> 00:48:05,468
and I realize,
fuck, I got a gun,

911
00:48:05,535 --> 00:48:07,135
so I ain't gotta pay.

912
00:48:07,203 --> 00:48:10,155
Did you shoot
the fucking clerk?

913
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,374
Nah.

914
00:48:12,442 --> 00:48:14,025
I just scared him, though.

915
00:48:16,947 --> 00:48:18,579
You want some of these?

916
00:48:18,847 --> 00:48:20,565
No.

917
00:48:20,633 --> 00:48:22,533
I got a 40 in here.

918
00:48:25,304 --> 00:48:27,555
Hey, girl, you want
some of these?

919
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:38,098
So this guy's all "son"
this and "son" that,

920
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,451
and I ain't
no fucking son of yours.

921
00:48:40,518 --> 00:48:41,602
Anyone else in there?

922
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:42,553
No.

923
00:48:44,973 --> 00:48:47,623
You are a fucking fool.

924
00:48:47,690 --> 00:48:50,592
Fucking fool! You know that?

925
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:52,644
I'm sitting there, trying
to pull damage control,

926
00:48:52,712 --> 00:48:55,114
and you'll fuck up, and you
gonna pull some shit like this?

927
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,032
You should have brought us to
the fucking police station

928
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:59,335
and just fucking
throw cuffs on us.

929
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:02,821
Dre, it's just
some munchies, man.

930
00:49:02,889 --> 00:49:04,372
You think this is a joke?

931
00:49:06,826 --> 00:49:08,293
That clerk saw you.

932
00:49:08,361 --> 00:49:10,662
He saw your face.
He heard your voice.

933
00:49:10,729 --> 00:49:11,796
He got you on camera.

934
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:13,431
I bet you he saw
the fucking car.

935
00:49:13,566 --> 00:49:16,000
Now he's gonna call
the fucking cops.

936
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:18,035
They're gonna be
looking for us.

937
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:19,920
Then what? You know
what happens then?

938
00:49:19,988 --> 00:49:21,788
You know what happens
if we get caught?

939
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,290
Look behind you.

940
00:49:25,127 --> 00:49:27,128
It's not a fucking joke.

941
00:49:28,130 --> 00:49:29,680
I knew this was a bad idea.

942
00:49:29,747 --> 00:49:31,265
I knew this was
a fucking bad idea.

943
00:49:31,332 --> 00:49:32,549
I'm trying to have your back.

944
00:49:34,334 --> 00:49:36,069
Why couldn't you
just go in there

945
00:49:36,137 --> 00:49:37,203
like a regular
fucking customer,

946
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,421
in and out, that's it?

947
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:40,090
Just 'cause
you got a fucking gun

948
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:41,725
doesn't mean you
gotta fucking use it.

949
00:49:41,792 --> 00:49:45,145
We're going away for the rest of our life.
You know that?

950
00:49:45,262 --> 00:49:47,229
Dre, I didn't
kill him or nothing.

951
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:49,098
Well, you should have
fucking killed him.

952
00:49:49,165 --> 00:49:50,699
You should have fucking
finished the job,

953
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,400
finished it like a man.

954
00:49:58,291 --> 00:50:00,209
Dre, we cool. It's...

955
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:03,194
We're not fucking cool,
Kevin! Are you serious?!

956
00:50:07,265 --> 00:50:09,466
We gotta ditch the car.

957
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:12,353
It's okay, man. I mean,

958
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:15,155
we'll tell J.J., a... and
he'll have to let me in,

959
00:50:15,223 --> 00:50:16,023
and it's gonna be okay.

960
00:50:16,090 --> 00:50:17,440
Shut the fuck up, okay.

961
00:50:17,508 --> 00:50:19,242
I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

962
00:50:20,711 --> 00:50:21,944
Dre, I'm sorry.

963
00:50:22,012 --> 00:50:24,280
I'm done
hearing you talk, Kevin.

964
00:50:27,851 --> 00:50:29,102
Potty training's over.

965
00:50:29,169 --> 00:50:31,369
I'm not your fucking
friend right now.

966
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:34,706
- Hey, hold up.
- I'm not gonna take it anymore.

967
00:50:34,774 --> 00:50:36,508
- What happened?
- I'm gonna fucking kill him.

968
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:37,777
Come on, man.

969
00:50:37,844 --> 00:50:40,445
No, Dre, I'm gonna put a
bullet in his fucking head.

970
00:50:40,513 --> 00:50:41,163
Hey! What?

971
00:50:42,882 --> 00:50:45,451
It ain't worth it, man, okay?

972
00:50:45,518 --> 00:50:46,717
What do you know?

973
00:50:46,785 --> 00:50:48,753
I know you're gonna go to jail

974
00:50:48,821 --> 00:50:50,104
for the rest
of your life, okay,

975
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:52,339
over some asshole your
mom brought home, okay?

976
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,358
Let's think about it
for a second.

977
00:50:56,394 --> 00:50:59,263
Can you just
take a walk with me?

978
00:51:00,749 --> 00:51:02,732
Kevin, take a walk with me.

979
00:51:04,535 --> 00:51:05,735
You trust me, right?

980
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,842
Yeah, all right.

981
00:51:11,909 --> 00:51:13,343
Let's do this.

982
00:52:18,254 --> 00:52:20,488
I don't know about this whole
"winner buys the drinks" thing.

983
00:52:20,556 --> 00:52:22,273
Well, it's the least
you two can do

984
00:52:22,341 --> 00:52:24,209
after making me look
like a chump over there.

985
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:25,811
It's all in the wrist, baby.

986
00:52:25,878 --> 00:52:26,812
- Is that right?
- Uh-huh.

987
00:52:26,879 --> 00:52:29,047
Whoa. Tequila shots already?

988
00:52:29,115 --> 00:52:31,031
Mm. I like to think of these

989
00:52:31,099 --> 00:52:33,033
as little shots of courage.

990
00:52:33,101 --> 00:52:34,251
Courage for what?

991
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:36,103
Nothing. We're
aborting the mission.

992
00:52:36,105 --> 00:52:38,105
Oh, I think someone
needs another shot.

993
00:52:38,173 --> 00:52:40,475
Um, Michael has
a date here tonight.

994
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:43,043
- What?
- I thought you two were still together.

995
00:52:43,111 --> 00:52:44,761
- Yeah, me, too.
- What an asshole.

996
00:52:44,829 --> 00:52:46,078
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

997
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:47,146
Speak of the devil.

998
00:52:47,214 --> 00:52:49,749
Is that the girl?

999
00:52:49,817 --> 00:52:51,718
Yeah.

1000
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:53,053
He's such an ass.

1001
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,570
Are you okay?

1002
00:52:54,638 --> 00:52:56,105
Yeah.

1003
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,958
Can we just go?

1004
00:52:58,025 --> 00:53:00,359
No. No, you have
to say something.

1005
00:53:00,426 --> 00:53:01,610
Seriously,
now's the time. Go on.

1006
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,762
Taking the reins
of life, baby. I love it.

1007
00:53:03,830 --> 00:53:07,049
- So does that mean he's single now?
- Jill.

1008
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:08,067
- I'm kidding.
- Yeah.

1009
00:53:08,134 --> 00:53:09,451
Seriously, I'm kidding.

1010
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:10,952
Well, I'm gonna go see if
I can find some sucker

1011
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,554
to try to take me on in darts.

1012
00:53:12,622 --> 00:53:13,438
I'll take that challenge.

1013
00:53:13,506 --> 00:53:14,906
Rach, I'm kind of ready to go.

1014
00:53:14,974 --> 00:53:16,107
Oh, you can't go.

1015
00:53:16,375 --> 00:53:17,342
The night's just
getting started.

1016
00:53:17,492 --> 00:53:18,692
Yeah, and... and I'm driving,

1017
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,261
so if I'm staying,
you're staying.

1018
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:22,346
My God. I wrecked my car.
Please just have some mercy.

1019
00:53:22,414 --> 00:53:24,265
You wrecked your car?

1020
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:25,983
It's been a long day.

1021
00:53:26,051 --> 00:53:27,218
Well, I can take you home.

1022
00:53:27,285 --> 00:53:28,602
Really?

1023
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,254
Yeah. No, I think I've squeezed

1024
00:53:31,322 --> 00:53:33,006
all the fun I can
out of this place.

1025
00:53:33,074 --> 00:53:34,024
- No. Stay.
- No...

1026
00:53:34,092 --> 00:53:35,775
No, I'm taking the reins, baby.

1027
00:53:35,843 --> 00:53:36,927
Touch.

1028
00:53:36,995 --> 00:53:38,294
All right,
well, go easy on him.

1029
00:53:38,362 --> 00:53:40,113
He's already had his ass
handed to him once tonight.

1030
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:41,264
I'll see you at home?

1031
00:53:41,332 --> 00:53:42,899
Yeah. You have your keys?

1032
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:44,000
Yes. I think.

1033
00:53:44,268 --> 00:53:45,868
Bye, guys.

1034
00:53:45,936 --> 00:53:47,219
Have a good night. Bye.

1035
00:54:03,952 --> 00:54:06,588
Oh, Jesus, help me, please.

1036
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:09,573
It's okay.

1037
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:12,843
You're gonna be okay.

1038
00:54:12,911 --> 00:54:14,778
I want to go home.

1039
00:54:22,803 --> 00:54:24,137
Oh, God.

1040
00:54:24,205 --> 00:54:25,405
Gonna be all right.

1041
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:27,791
Please, help me.

1042
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:29,892
Please help me.

1043
00:54:30,944 --> 00:54:31,877
" Open up the shells. "

1044
00:54:31,945 --> 00:54:33,329
" Put your 5-o out. "

1045
00:54:33,397 --> 00:54:35,031
" No mercy, no pleas, "

1046
00:54:35,098 --> 00:54:36,499
" let my trigger finger
squeeze. "

1047
00:54:36,567 --> 00:54:38,033
" My money's on my mind, "

1048
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:39,768
" and I'll pay
to make you bleed, "

1049
00:54:39,836 --> 00:54:40,736
" 'cause I sneak a... "

1050
00:54:44,023 --> 00:54:45,574
Shh. Shh.

1051
00:55:00,321 --> 00:55:01,889
Hey. Hey.

1052
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:06,927
Shh.

1053
00:55:06,995 --> 00:55:08,662
Oh, God.

1054
00:55:16,636 --> 00:55:18,504
Are you okay?

1055
00:55:20,390 --> 00:55:22,675
Hey. Hey, wake up.

1056
00:55:24,644 --> 00:55:25,912
Hey. Hey.

1057
00:55:28,881 --> 00:55:30,248
Shh.

1058
00:55:32,952 --> 00:55:34,586
Shit.

1059
00:56:27,136 --> 00:56:28,636
What are you doing?

1060
00:56:30,856 --> 00:56:32,757
I gotta think.

1061
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:42,066
Shit.

1062
00:57:04,121 --> 00:57:06,055
You want to have sex?

1063
00:57:07,557 --> 00:57:08,891
No.

1064
00:57:13,996 --> 00:57:16,698
Take your pants off.

1065
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:18,667
No. No. No.

1066
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:21,786
I'm not fucking around, girl!

1067
00:57:28,376 --> 00:57:29,643
Come on!

1068
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:31,044
O... okay.

1069
00:57:31,112 --> 00:57:32,146
Please don't do this.

1070
00:57:32,213 --> 00:57:33,914
Please don't do this.

1071
00:57:41,189 --> 00:57:42,388
Please don't do this.

1072
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:43,722
Now, bitch.

1073
00:57:47,861 --> 00:57:50,746
I cannot wait
for this day to be over.

1074
00:57:50,814 --> 00:57:51,747
I hear you.

1075
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:56,169
Oh, shit, I forgot my credit
card back at the bar.

1076
00:57:56,236 --> 00:57:57,169
I'll wait here.

1077
00:57:57,236 --> 00:57:58,503
I'll be right back.

1078
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,791
Where the fuck are we?

1079
00:58:20,859 --> 00:58:21,575
By the college.

1080
00:58:21,643 --> 00:58:23,861
What are we doing over here?

1081
00:58:24,796 --> 00:58:27,563
Come on, man. I'll show you.

1082
00:58:27,631 --> 00:58:30,267
It's a good place
right up here.

1083
00:58:30,367 --> 00:58:32,468
I'm hungry.

1084
00:58:32,536 --> 00:58:34,938
It'll be a'ight.

1085
00:58:35,006 --> 00:58:35,638
Hey.

1086
00:58:35,706 --> 00:58:36,539
Got it?

1087
00:58:36,606 --> 00:58:39,092
Yep. Let's get out of here.

1088
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,413
Hey, thanks for
rescuing me back there.

1089
00:58:45,481 --> 00:58:47,399
No problem.

1090
00:58:47,466 --> 00:58:49,902
You sure you're okay?

1091
00:58:49,969 --> 00:58:51,720
Heh.

1092
00:58:51,787 --> 00:58:52,988
Yeah.

1093
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:56,458
You been here before?

1094
00:58:56,526 --> 00:58:59,160
Yeah, man, a few times.

1095
00:59:00,896 --> 00:59:03,564
I mean, I know it's
for the best, so...

1096
00:59:03,632 --> 00:59:06,133
You deserve a lot better,
seriously.

1097
00:59:06,168 --> 00:59:08,869
I just can't believe
it took me so long.

1098
00:59:10,589 --> 00:59:12,355
- Hey, Dre...
- Hmm?

1099
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:13,824
You ever kill someone?

1100
00:59:13,891 --> 00:59:14,825
Hell, no.

1101
00:59:14,892 --> 00:59:16,860
Come on, man. You know
better than that.

1102
00:59:17,895 --> 00:59:20,314
Can you believe we're
about to graduate?

1103
00:59:20,464 --> 00:59:21,514
God, I know.

1104
00:59:21,582 --> 00:59:23,699
You're going
to law school, right?

1105
00:59:23,767 --> 00:59:26,969
Yeah, that's the plan.

1106
00:59:27,037 --> 00:59:29,704
You don't sound
too stoked about that.

1107
00:59:31,524 --> 00:59:35,710
I was, but I don't know.
People tell you

1108
00:59:35,896 --> 00:59:38,664
your whole life you're gonna
be this certain thing,

1109
00:59:38,731 --> 00:59:43,251
and then somehow you just
one day end up becoming it.

1110
00:59:43,319 --> 00:59:45,003
J.J.'S killed lots of people.

1111
00:59:45,070 --> 00:59:47,722
Yeah, well, J.J.'S out of his damn mind.
You know that.

1112
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:49,991
He's a real fucking gangster.

1113
00:59:50,058 --> 00:59:51,509
Yes, he is.

1114
00:59:52,811 --> 00:59:54,946
Hey, about J.J.
And those guys...

1115
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:56,079
Yeah?

1116
00:59:56,147 --> 00:59:57,080
You joining, man?

1117
00:59:57,148 --> 00:59:59,850
J.J. Said if
I steal a car, I'm in.

1118
01:00:00,051 --> 01:00:01,835
It's about fucking time, too.

1119
01:00:01,902 --> 01:00:04,605
I don't know why they
didn't let me in before.

1120
01:00:04,673 --> 01:00:06,406
Kev, they didn't
let you in before

1121
01:00:06,474 --> 01:00:08,208
'cause I asked them not to.

1122
01:00:08,275 --> 01:00:09,526
What?

1123
01:00:09,593 --> 01:00:11,677
I didn't want to see you
get caught up

1124
01:00:11,744 --> 01:00:13,562
in something that you
have no idea about.

1125
01:00:13,630 --> 01:00:16,048
So you don't want
to be a lawyer?

1126
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:19,785
I don't know.

1127
01:00:20,637 --> 01:00:22,355
In a way, I guess I've never

1128
01:00:22,422 --> 01:00:23,555
really thought about it before.

1129
01:00:23,623 --> 01:00:25,491
Why would you do
something like that?

1130
01:00:25,559 --> 01:00:28,427
I was just trying to
protect you. That's it.

1131
01:00:28,494 --> 01:00:30,195
You're not
my fucking daddy, Dre!

1132
01:00:30,263 --> 01:00:32,314
Yeah, I know that, but I'm
the closest thing you got

1133
01:00:32,382 --> 01:00:34,149
to family, okay?

1134
01:00:34,217 --> 01:00:35,533
Man, fuck you!

1135
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:37,452
All I was trying to do
was protect you.

1136
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:38,537
Yeah? Protect me from what?

1137
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:39,704
From... from what? From all this.

1138
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:40,737
From everything. From yourself.

1139
01:00:40,805 --> 01:00:42,039
Fuck this! This is bullshit!

1140
01:00:42,107 --> 01:00:44,140
Come on. Kevin! Kevin, hold on!

1141
01:00:44,208 --> 01:00:45,960
Well, what would you do?

1142
01:00:48,530 --> 01:00:53,334
I would just pack up
my car and just go.

1143
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,901
Where would you go?

1144
01:00:55,970 --> 01:00:57,603
Anywhere.

1145
01:00:58,973 --> 01:01:00,823
Come on! Hurry up, girl.

1146
01:01:03,793 --> 01:01:06,095
Please don't do this.

1147
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:10,016
What the fuck are you doing?

1148
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:13,885
Give me the fucking gun.
Give me the gun!

1149
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:14,886
A'ight!

1150
01:01:16,539 --> 01:01:18,306
Everybody out!

1151
01:01:18,374 --> 01:01:19,942
Everybody out.

1152
01:01:21,745 --> 01:01:22,911
What are you doing?

1153
01:01:22,979 --> 01:01:25,130
I know what I got to do now.

1154
01:01:25,197 --> 01:01:26,280
I'm finishing it.

1155
01:01:30,285 --> 01:01:31,135
Get out!

1156
01:01:31,203 --> 01:01:32,286
Dre, wait up!

1157
01:01:32,354 --> 01:01:33,954
Hold up!

1158
01:01:34,990 --> 01:01:37,575
This is you.
This is you, Kevin.

1159
01:01:47,618 --> 01:01:50,053
You next to her.

1160
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,155
Dre, don't do this, please.

1161
01:01:53,424 --> 01:01:55,691
What'd you call me?

1162
01:01:59,029 --> 01:01:59,778
Shit.

1163
01:01:59,846 --> 01:02:01,463
Get down next to her!

1164
01:02:01,731 --> 01:02:03,733
Next to her on your knees!

1165
01:02:05,435 --> 01:02:07,636
What are you gonna do, Dre?

1166
01:02:07,704 --> 01:02:09,104
We're finishing it.

1167
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:11,956
We're gonna finish
what you started.

1168
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:18,729
Face the wall!

1169
01:02:18,964 --> 01:02:20,364
Put your face against the wall.

1170
01:02:20,432 --> 01:02:21,733
Face up against the wall.

1171
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:22,867
Please don't do this.

1172
01:02:22,935 --> 01:02:25,068
Turn your face to the wall!

1173
01:02:35,029 --> 01:02:37,314
Okay.

1174
01:02:37,382 --> 01:02:39,898
Ah, jeez.

1175
01:02:46,657 --> 01:02:48,558
Can I do it?

1176
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,493
What?

1177
01:02:54,730 --> 01:02:57,048
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1178
01:02:59,818 --> 01:03:02,069
You think this is fun?

1179
01:03:03,539 --> 01:03:05,940
You think this
is some gangster shit?

1180
01:03:07,677 --> 01:03:09,893
You want to shoot somebody?

1181
01:03:09,961 --> 01:03:11,945
I should fucking shoot you!

1182
01:03:12,013 --> 01:03:13,914
Come on, Dre. Chill out.

1183
01:03:13,982 --> 01:03:15,866
"Chill out!" "Chill out!"

1184
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,818
I worked my whole life...

1185
01:03:17,885 --> 01:03:21,522
My whole life
to not be like this,

1186
01:03:21,589 --> 01:03:24,490
for you not to get like this!

1187
01:03:24,558 --> 01:03:25,525
Look at us now,

1188
01:03:25,592 --> 01:03:27,944
exactly what
they thought we'd be!

1189
01:03:28,011 --> 01:03:30,179
Kevin, what do you think's
gonna happen after this?

1190
01:03:30,247 --> 01:03:32,815
Look at these girls!
Look at them. Look at us.

1191
01:03:32,883 --> 01:03:35,317
It's over.
It's all fucking over.

1192
01:03:35,385 --> 01:03:39,020
I got a gun in my hand 'cause I
don't see any other way out!

1193
01:03:41,541 --> 01:03:42,840
It's all right, man.

1194
01:03:42,908 --> 01:03:46,311
If we kill 'em, no
one'll know it was us.

1195
01:03:48,131 --> 01:03:49,798
Ah, Kevin...

1196
01:03:54,236 --> 01:03:55,702
We'll know.

1197
01:04:02,010 --> 01:04:03,860
I'm outta here.

1198
01:04:03,928 --> 01:04:05,579
I'm getting outta here.

1199
01:04:05,814 --> 01:04:07,164
Where the fuck are you going?

1200
01:04:07,232 --> 01:04:08,432
Just go. No.

1201
01:04:08,500 --> 01:04:10,566
Just go.

1202
01:04:10,634 --> 01:04:12,435
I can't leave you here.

1203
01:04:14,689 --> 01:04:16,756
Okay. Okay, just stay here.

1204
01:04:16,824 --> 01:04:18,091
I'll be right back.

1205
01:04:20,945 --> 01:04:22,162
Where the fuck you going?

1206
01:04:22,229 --> 01:04:23,762
You can't leave!

1207
01:04:23,829 --> 01:04:25,730
They'll go to the cops! Shit.

1208
01:04:25,798 --> 01:04:27,416
Hey, girl!

1209
01:04:27,484 --> 01:04:29,117
- This is bullshit!
- You're not hearing what I'm trying

1210
01:04:29,185 --> 01:04:30,652
- to say to you, okay?
- Just shut up!

1211
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,854
Stop for a second.
Listen to me.

1212
01:04:31,921 --> 01:04:33,355
Get away from me!

1213
01:04:33,423 --> 01:04:34,956
You're not hearing what
I'm trying to say to you.

1214
01:04:35,024 --> 01:04:36,658
Stop. Listen to me
for a second.

1215
01:04:36,726 --> 01:04:38,676
Kevin, you don't understand
what I'm trying to tell you.

1216
01:04:38,744 --> 01:04:41,028
I... I was just trying to
protect you, that's it. Okay?

1217
01:04:41,096 --> 01:04:42,847
I'm gonna Jack
this car right here.

1218
01:04:42,915 --> 01:04:43,915
Kevin, what are you doing?

1219
01:04:43,983 --> 01:04:45,767
I'm gonna do
my initiation right now!

1220
01:04:45,834 --> 01:04:46,934
Kevin, come on.

1221
01:04:47,002 --> 01:04:49,403
Let's just get
out of here, okay?

1222
01:04:49,471 --> 01:04:51,706
Kevin, come on! Kevin!

1223
01:04:51,773 --> 01:04:53,740
Let's get out of here, okay?

1224
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:54,925
- God.
- Kevin, stop!

1225
01:04:54,993 --> 01:04:57,143
Kevin, get off the car!

1226
01:04:57,211 --> 01:04:59,412
- You know there's an alarm on that car!
- Let's...

1227
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,547
man, fuck that shit!

1228
01:05:03,334 --> 01:05:05,652
Oh, my God.

1229
01:05:06,854 --> 01:05:09,171
Give me the keys, bitch!

1230
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:11,006
- Kevin, stop, okay?
- Give me the keys!

1231
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:13,042
- Kevin, put the gun down!
- Shut up!

1232
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:14,860
Let's just go, Kevin!
What are you doing?

1233
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:15,962
- Shut up!
- Kevin!

1234
01:05:16,029 --> 01:05:17,796
Purse! Give me your purse!

1235
01:05:17,864 --> 01:05:19,965
Get in the fucking car!

1236
01:05:20,033 --> 01:05:21,500
Get in the car!

1237
01:05:21,568 --> 01:05:22,718
Kevin, what are you doing?

1238
01:05:22,786 --> 01:05:24,052
- Get in the fucking car!
- Kevin, put it down.

1239
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:25,654
Get in the car!
Get in the fucking car!

1240
01:05:25,804 --> 01:05:27,171
- Take whatever you want. Please.
- Drive.

1241
01:05:27,239 --> 01:05:29,273
Take it. Take it.
Just don't hit me.

1242
01:05:29,275 --> 01:05:30,825
- Get in the car!
- Just don't do this.

1243
01:05:30,893 --> 01:05:31,959
Kevin! Please don't do this!

1244
01:05:32,028 --> 01:05:33,094
Come on.
Get in the fucking car.

1245
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:34,211
Please, please don't do this.

1246
01:05:34,279 --> 01:05:35,379
Shut the fuck up!

1247
01:05:35,481 --> 01:05:36,631
- Take whatever you want.
- Shit.

1248
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:38,131
Get in! Let's go! Come on.

1249
01:05:38,199 --> 01:05:40,717
Get in the car! Shut up!

1250
01:05:40,785 --> 01:05:42,019
- Please!
- Kevin, what are you doing?

1251
01:05:42,186 --> 01:05:43,720
- Now!
- Kevin, put the gun down!

1252
01:05:43,788 --> 01:05:44,988
Shut the fuck up!

1253
01:05:45,056 --> 01:05:47,157
- Kevin!
- Please don't... help!

1254
01:05:47,375 --> 01:05:49,410
- Kevin, stop!
- Get in the fucking car!

1255
01:05:49,477 --> 01:05:51,528
Help!

1256
01:05:51,596 --> 01:05:53,062
No!

1257
01:05:58,602 --> 01:06:00,119
What the fuck
did you do, Kevin?

1258
01:06:00,187 --> 01:06:01,804
What the fuck did you do?

1259
01:06:01,872 --> 01:06:05,107
Get in the car! Get in the car!

1260
01:06:05,175 --> 01:06:06,242
Oh, shit.

1261
01:06:11,948 --> 01:06:13,799
Shit.

1262
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:16,117
Fuck.

1263
01:06:37,288 --> 01:06:38,371
Come on, man.

1264
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:39,939
Dre...

1265
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:45,044
You know I had to do it.

1266
01:06:45,112 --> 01:06:47,630
Let's just get out of here.

1267
01:06:47,698 --> 01:06:49,666
Let's go find J.J., man.

1268
01:06:49,733 --> 01:06:51,417
You hear me?

1269
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:54,686
You have any idea
what's going on?

1270
01:06:54,754 --> 01:06:56,889
You don't tell J.J. Anything.

1271
01:06:56,956 --> 01:06:58,957
Nothing, you hear me?

1272
01:07:00,459 --> 01:07:03,294
This is really bad.
You know that?

1273
01:07:03,362 --> 01:07:05,180
Really fucking bad right now.

1274
01:07:37,693 --> 01:07:39,378
Kevin...

1275
01:07:40,731 --> 01:07:43,132
That place
I took you to today...

1276
01:07:45,869 --> 01:07:48,003
That's some place I go to...

1277
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:54,458
I wanted to show you
that there's... there's...

1278
01:07:57,546 --> 01:08:00,381
There's... there's a place
you can escape.

1279
01:08:05,538 --> 01:08:11,191
Hey, listen, just don't say anything
to anybody about tonight, okay?

1280
01:08:11,258 --> 01:08:13,159
It's a different world.

1281
01:08:13,227 --> 01:08:15,546
Those girls aren't
from this world.

1282
01:08:17,348 --> 01:08:20,517
We're in a lot of trouble.
You know that?

1283
01:08:24,087 --> 01:08:25,220
Go home, Kevin.

1284
01:08:25,288 --> 01:08:26,923
Go home.

1285
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:31,427
And don't say anything
to anyone. You hear me?

1286
01:08:36,699 --> 01:08:38,533
It's in God's hands now.

1287
01:08:57,502 --> 01:09:01,488
Help! Help me! Help me!
I need help!

1288
01:09:01,556 --> 01:09:03,790
Help!

1289
01:09:03,858 --> 01:09:07,860
Please, I need help! Please!

1290
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:12,532
Oh, my God.

1291
01:09:12,599 --> 01:09:13,800
Oh, my God.

1292
01:09:16,186 --> 01:09:19,338
Hello. Help me.
Help me. Help me, please.

1293
01:09:23,142 --> 01:09:25,176
No! No! No!

1294
01:09:25,244 --> 01:09:25,978
No!

1295
01:09:26,045 --> 01:09:27,695
No, no.

1296
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:29,497
No, no, no.

1297
01:09:29,565 --> 01:09:30,498
Oh, my God.

1298
01:09:30,566 --> 01:09:31,299
Please.

1299
01:09:31,367 --> 01:09:35,320
Please, somebody help me!

1300
01:09:35,388 --> 01:09:36,670
Please!

1301
01:09:40,575 --> 01:09:41,508
Oh, my God.

1302
01:09:43,111 --> 01:09:45,612
Help me! Please!

1303
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,799
Somebody help me!

1304
01:09:52,737 --> 01:09:54,671
Holy shit.

1305
01:09:54,738 --> 01:09:57,140
W-what happened to you?

1306
01:09:58,125 --> 01:09:59,375
What happened?

1307
01:09:59,443 --> 01:10:01,644
Come on. Come on. Get... get in.

1308
01:10:01,712 --> 01:10:02,846
L.. let me help you.

1309
01:10:02,914 --> 01:10:04,580
Come on. Come on.

1310
01:10:04,648 --> 01:10:06,348
Get in, lady.

1311
01:10:06,416 --> 01:10:07,800
Come on, lady. Let me help you.

1312
01:10:08,785 --> 01:10:10,536
Come on. Let me help.

1313
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,575
What happened?

1314
01:10:16,642 --> 01:10:19,328
They shot me.

1315
01:10:22,397 --> 01:10:24,115
What's your name, sweetie?

1316
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:26,133
Where are you taking me?

1317
01:10:26,201 --> 01:10:28,169
There's a hospital nearby.

1318
01:10:28,236 --> 01:10:29,370
They'll take care of you.

1319
01:10:30,355 --> 01:10:31,639
W... what's your name?

1320
01:10:31,707 --> 01:10:33,391
Carley.

1321
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:34,991
All right.

1322
01:10:35,059 --> 01:10:37,811
Oh, my God. Lena.

1323
01:10:37,878 --> 01:10:39,479
What happened? What happened?
Who's Lena?

1324
01:10:39,547 --> 01:10:41,264
They took her to the tunnel,
and then she's just...

1325
01:10:41,432 --> 01:10:43,216
She's waiting there.
We have to go back.

1326
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:44,050
We have to go back!

1327
01:10:44,118 --> 01:10:45,652
No. We... we cannot go back!

1328
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:47,404
When we get to
the hospital, we'll...

1329
01:10:47,472 --> 01:10:48,622
No, no, she...

1330
01:10:48,690 --> 01:10:50,489
No, we'll send someone
to go find her. You...

1331
01:10:50,557 --> 01:10:52,858
we got to get you taken
care of, all right?

1332
01:10:52,926 --> 01:10:54,377
Carley, can you hear me?

1333
01:10:56,713 --> 01:10:58,930
Carley?

1334
01:10:59,199 --> 01:11:01,484
She graduates in two weeks.

1335
01:11:01,551 --> 01:11:05,303
She's probably just waiting
there like I told her.

1336
01:11:07,390 --> 01:11:09,808
I promise we'll go back
to find her, all right?

1337
01:11:09,876 --> 01:11:10,809
We'll find your friend.

1338
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,061
Look, h...hold this up
for me, sweetie.

1339
01:11:14,130 --> 01:11:15,330
Hold that... hold that up.

1340
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:18,399
Okay. That's it.

1341
01:11:20,701 --> 01:11:22,219
Carley, stay with me.
Stay with me.

1342
01:11:22,286 --> 01:11:23,821
Look at me, Carley. Carley!

1343
01:11:25,306 --> 01:11:26,840
Somebody's been shot!

1344
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:28,391
Help!

1345
01:11:33,681 --> 01:11:35,814
That's it. That's it now.

1346
01:11:35,882 --> 01:11:36,782
It's all right.

1347
01:11:39,219 --> 01:11:40,819
Okay, come on.

1348
01:11:44,791 --> 01:11:46,659
Somebody's been shot!

1349
01:11:46,727 --> 01:11:48,494
Hurry up!

1350
01:11:48,562 --> 01:11:49,761
Somebody come!

1351
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:52,881
All right,
what have we got here?

1352
01:11:52,949 --> 01:11:54,449
- She was shot in the head.
- Lay your head down, ma'am.

1353
01:11:54,517 --> 01:11:56,751
- I don't know how many times.
- Who are you?

1354
01:11:56,819 --> 01:11:58,203
I found her in the streets.

1355
01:11:58,270 --> 01:11:59,337
She... she was
wandering the streets.

1356
01:11:59,505 --> 01:12:00,438
What's your name, honey?

1357
01:12:00,506 --> 01:12:01,322
Carley Mitchell.

1358
01:12:01,390 --> 01:12:03,108
She had a friend with her.

1359
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,342
She's in the tunnel.
She said she was in a tunnel.

1360
01:12:04,476 --> 01:12:05,392
All right. You know what, sir?

1361
01:12:05,460 --> 01:12:06,543
We can take it from here.

1362
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:08,211
- What?
- No, no, no, go with me.

1363
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:09,564
- I'm... I...
- Please don't...

1364
01:12:09,631 --> 01:12:11,114
Carley. Don't leave me!

1365
01:12:11,132 --> 01:12:12,616
I'll be right here!
I'll be right here!

1366
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:14,018
I'm sure the police
want to speak with you.

1367
01:12:14,086 --> 01:12:14,985
No! Carley!

1368
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:16,019
I'll be right here!

1369
01:12:16,087 --> 01:12:18,339
I ain't going nowhere.

1370
01:12:42,512 --> 01:12:44,930
Where exactly was she
when you found her?

1371
01:12:44,932 --> 01:12:49,683
I saw her wandering on Jett
not far from the tracks.

1372
01:12:49,751 --> 01:12:52,420
She give you any details
about what happened?

1373
01:12:52,487 --> 01:12:57,324
Nah. Well, it seemed like,
uh, they were in her car,

1374
01:12:57,392 --> 01:13:00,995
and, um, she said
her friend was with her,

1375
01:13:01,063 --> 01:13:04,180
and they left her
in... in a tunnel.

1376
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:06,616
She tell you anything
about who they were?

1377
01:13:06,684 --> 01:13:07,768
Nah.

1378
01:13:07,835 --> 01:13:09,803
You didn't ask?

1379
01:13:09,871 --> 01:13:13,072
Well, I was kind of focused on
getting her to the hospital.

1380
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,541
She'd been shot in the head.

1381
01:13:14,609 --> 01:13:16,893
Where were you going when
you encountered the victim?

1382
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,794
What?

1383
01:13:18,796 --> 01:13:22,214
This receipt has the girl
leaving a bar called the tavern

1384
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:25,400
approximately 96 minutes
before she was admitted.

1385
01:13:25,468 --> 01:13:27,369
Were you anywhere
within that vicinity?

1386
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:33,675
No. I told you I saw her
running in the street.

1387
01:13:33,743 --> 01:13:34,842
Where were you going?

1388
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:37,012
I was headed home.

1389
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,513
Where's that?

1390
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:40,448
I live on Elizabeth Avenue.

1391
01:13:40,515 --> 01:13:42,383
Where were you coming from?

1392
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,287
I have a restaurant.

1393
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:48,288
I run a barbecue place
in the neighborhood.

1394
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:49,489
I was coming from there.

1395
01:13:49,557 --> 01:13:50,557
Anybody see you there?

1396
01:13:50,624 --> 01:13:51,859
What kind
of a question is that?

1397
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:53,227
- What you mean...
- Just answer the question, sir,

1398
01:13:53,294 --> 01:13:54,461
or we can do this
down at the station.

1399
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:55,795
My customers. My
customers saw me there.

1400
01:13:55,830 --> 01:13:57,564
- You know any of their names?
- What, all of them?

1401
01:13:57,631 --> 01:14:00,100
Does anybody work with you?

1402
01:14:00,168 --> 01:14:01,668
My nephew,

1403
01:14:01,736 --> 01:14:04,269
but he left early, so I closed.

1404
01:14:05,655 --> 01:14:08,590
We're gonna need his name
and contact information.

1405
01:14:18,283 --> 01:14:20,985
Heh. Shit.

1406
01:14:30,879 --> 01:14:32,763
We'll be in touch.

1407
01:16:16,695 --> 01:16:21,381
Dr. Bradley, 2744.

1408
01:16:21,449 --> 01:16:25,368
Dr. Bradley, 2744.

1409
01:16:33,025 --> 01:16:35,945
Hey, little man.

1410
01:16:35,947 --> 01:16:39,281
Ray? Yeah, it's me.

1411
01:16:39,349 --> 01:16:40,850
Oh, uh...

1412
01:16:40,917 --> 01:16:44,019
I didn't mean to bother
you on your date.

1413
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:48,706
It's almost curfew.
You know that, right?

1414
01:16:52,895 --> 01:16:54,328
Nah, nah.

1415
01:16:54,396 --> 01:16:56,297
I'm not home yet. Uh...

1416
01:16:56,365 --> 01:16:58,015
Just running a little late.

1417
01:17:00,536 --> 01:17:04,254
Nah. Uh, just, uh...

1418
01:17:04,322 --> 01:17:06,106
just helping a friend.

1419
01:17:08,510 --> 01:17:11,177
Yeah, okay, no.
I was just checking in.

1420
01:17:13,014 --> 01:17:14,731
You get home safe, okay?

1421
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:18,718
Yeah, all right.

1422
01:17:18,785 --> 01:17:19,836
Ray?

1423
01:17:22,222 --> 01:17:23,823
Um...

1424
01:17:31,347 --> 01:17:33,097
You're my heart.

1425
01:17:35,001 --> 01:17:36,801
You know that, right?

1426
01:17:40,840 --> 01:17:42,040
Yeah.

1427
01:17:45,011 --> 01:17:46,276
Yeah, okay.

1428
01:17:46,344 --> 01:17:48,111
Yeah, you...

1429
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:50,981
you be safe, all right?

1430
01:17:51,049 --> 01:17:54,018
All right, yeah. Okay.
All right, bye. Yeah.

1431
01:17:57,889 --> 01:18:00,124
Dr. Gateau to the pharmacy.

1432
01:18:00,192 --> 01:18:03,376
Dr. Gateau to the pharmacy.

1433
01:19:32,544 --> 01:19:34,744
Hi.

1434
01:19:36,914 --> 01:19:38,549
Hey.

1435
01:19:43,187 --> 01:19:45,254
I'm... I'm Duane.

1436
01:19:45,322 --> 01:19:46,489
I... I brought you here.

1437
01:19:46,557 --> 01:19:49,892
Where's Lena?

1438
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,594
Um...

1439
01:19:51,662 --> 01:19:53,596
Hey, you... you might want to...

1440
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:55,598
No, no. Lay back. Come on.

1441
01:19:55,666 --> 01:19:57,800
Is she okay?

1442
01:19:57,835 --> 01:20:00,135
Look, y... you got really lucky.

1443
01:20:00,203 --> 01:20:02,637
They say the bullets
shattered in your skull,

1444
01:20:02,705 --> 01:20:04,606
d.. didn't even
get to your brain, so...

1445
01:20:04,674 --> 01:20:05,941
Where's Lena?

1446
01:20:08,711 --> 01:20:11,746
They found her in the
tunnel, like you said.

1447
01:20:13,916 --> 01:20:15,749
She didn't make it.

1448
01:20:18,536 --> 01:20:20,671
I'm... I'm sorry.

1449
01:20:22,474 --> 01:20:25,593
No. No, she was... she was okay.

1450
01:20:27,412 --> 01:20:28,295
I'm... I'm sorry.

1451
01:20:28,363 --> 01:20:30,480
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1452
01:20:30,547 --> 01:20:32,148
Oh, my God!

1453
01:20:32,215 --> 01:20:33,650
I left her there!

1454
01:20:33,717 --> 01:20:35,217
- I left...
- A.. all right...

1455
01:20:35,286 --> 01:20:37,320
Oh, my God!

1456
01:20:37,388 --> 01:20:40,106
No! No!

1457
01:20:40,174 --> 01:20:42,224
I'm... I'm sorry.

1458
01:20:42,293 --> 01:20:43,793
Oh, no!

1459
01:20:43,860 --> 01:20:46,311
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1460
01:20:46,379 --> 01:20:48,379
No! God!

1461
01:20:48,447 --> 01:20:49,798
All right.

1462
01:20:53,085 --> 01:20:55,854
All right, all right,
I... I got you. I got you.

1463
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:58,106
I got you. I got you.

1464
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:00,146
Let's go, Riggs.

1465
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,268
Hands on the wall.

1466
01:22:19,215 --> 01:22:20,015
Okay.

1467
01:22:21,685 --> 01:22:22,835
Inmate name?

1468
01:22:22,903 --> 01:22:23,869
Um...

1469
01:22:23,937 --> 01:22:26,405
Who are you here to see, honey?

1470
01:22:26,472 --> 01:22:28,107
Andre Riggs.

1471
01:22:42,688 --> 01:22:44,822
Down the hall.
Through the doors.

1472
01:23:19,172 --> 01:23:21,039
Hi.

1473
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:24,042
Hi.

1474
01:23:26,796 --> 01:23:28,796
I heard about your cousin.

1475
01:23:30,365 --> 01:23:34,067
They sent me a letter
to tell me that he died.

1476
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:38,505
Yeah, it happened
in the yard. He, um...

1477
01:23:38,574 --> 01:23:40,975
he got what was coming to him.

1478
01:23:42,477 --> 01:23:44,227
I'm leaving Georgia,

1479
01:23:44,294 --> 01:23:47,214
but they want me to
put a statement on file

1480
01:23:47,281 --> 01:23:49,849
for when you're up for parole.

1481
01:23:49,917 --> 01:23:53,052
So, um...

1482
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:57,923
I have to do this to... to know
what I'm gonna tell them.

1483
01:24:02,578 --> 01:24:05,430
I've thought about this
moment a thousand times...

1484
01:24:09,268 --> 01:24:11,403
About what I'd say to you.

1485
01:24:17,509 --> 01:24:19,744
I'm sorry.

1486
01:24:19,812 --> 01:24:21,546
I'm so sorry.

1487
01:24:24,716 --> 01:24:26,851
I've tried to forgive you.

1488
01:24:28,619 --> 01:24:32,989
Everybody says that you have
to try to forgive and move on,

1489
01:24:33,057 --> 01:24:35,158
but what people
don't understand

1490
01:24:35,226 --> 01:24:37,861
is that I can't move on.

1491
01:24:39,797 --> 01:24:44,149
I see you every time
I close my eyes.

1492
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:48,086
I see you every time
I go to sleep at night.

1493
01:24:50,123 --> 01:24:52,791
You took something away
from me that night,

1494
01:24:52,859 --> 01:24:54,994
that I will never get back.

1495
01:24:57,029 --> 01:25:00,114
I hate you. I hate you.

1496
01:25:00,182 --> 01:25:01,966
I hate you for what you did.

1497
01:25:02,034 --> 01:25:03,601
I hate you for letting her die.

1498
01:25:03,669 --> 01:25:06,805
You could have stopped
it, and you didn't!

1499
01:25:06,872 --> 01:25:09,941
I saw you... Look at me!

1500
01:25:10,009 --> 01:25:11,175
Look at me!

1501
01:25:12,777 --> 01:25:14,210
I saw your eyes that night,

1502
01:25:14,278 --> 01:25:16,613
and you didn't have to let
it happen, and you did. Why?

1503
01:25:16,681 --> 01:25:18,448
I don't know.

1504
01:25:18,516 --> 01:25:20,050
Bullshit!

1505
01:25:23,404 --> 01:25:24,504
I was weak.

1506
01:25:24,572 --> 01:25:27,256
You're a monster.

1507
01:25:29,309 --> 01:25:31,477
Somewhere that night,
I got lost.

1508
01:25:32,963 --> 01:25:35,948
I let my fear take over.
I was...

1509
01:25:38,885 --> 01:25:43,355
I became everything
I vowed not to be.

1510
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,561
I was weak.

1511
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:55,667
And I'd do anything...

1512
01:25:55,735 --> 01:25:58,068
I mean anything...

1513
01:26:01,973 --> 01:26:03,641
Anything to take it back...

1514
01:26:03,709 --> 01:26:05,376
Well, you can't. I know.

1515
01:26:08,363 --> 01:26:10,498
You made your choice
that night...

1516
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:15,001
And I can't change that,

1517
01:26:15,068 --> 01:26:17,270
but I'm gonna make my choice.

1518
01:26:17,338 --> 01:26:19,439
I'm gonna live my life.

1519
01:26:22,143 --> 01:26:24,177
I'm gonna show you
the same humanity

1520
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,945
that I wish you
would have shown me.

1521
01:26:29,349 --> 01:26:33,485
You don't deserve to live in
the same world that I do...

1522
01:26:35,021 --> 01:26:38,323
But your life is
not mine to take...

1523
01:26:39,242 --> 01:26:41,659
Just like Lena's wasn't yours.

1524
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:48,715
I pray to God you
don't get lost again.

1525
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:52,486
I'm so sorry.

1526
01:26:52,554 --> 01:26:53,371
I am.

1527
01:27:44,051 --> 01:27:48,672
" How did I get here? "

1528
01:27:48,739 --> 01:27:50,257
Step in the cell.

1529
01:27:56,562 --> 01:28:04,562
" I can't feel your heart. "

1530
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:10,791
" Ohh, ohh. "

1531
01:28:21,169 --> 01:28:24,155
" Holding "

1532
01:28:24,223 --> 01:28:29,492
" Feeling blue, "

1533
01:28:33,131 --> 01:28:40,269
" around you, hold on. "
