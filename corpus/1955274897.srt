1
00:00:27,853 --> 00:00:31,957
* I learned the truth
at seventeen *

2
00:00:31,957 --> 00:00:33,859
* That love was meant *

3
00:00:33,859 --> 00:00:35,493
Turn it off!

4
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:37,528
What are you,
the fucking music czar?

5
00:00:37,528 --> 00:00:39,230
Okay, language, Ellen!

6
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,332
Please, this song can not be
playing when we drive up.

7
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,168
What is wrong with it?

8
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,503
Ellen, I'm begging you.
It's like announcing
you're a loser.

9
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:49,340
Oh, great. Then you'll fit
right in with the other weirdos.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,010
I don't get what you're doing
at this creative arts camp
anyway.

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,912
Aren't you supposed to have
some sort of talent?

12
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,347
I thought she was a hoot
in "Bye, Bye, Birdie."

13
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,416
She played the mayor's wife.
She had no lines.

14
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,952
All she had to do was faint
and spread her legs.

15
00:01:00,952 --> 00:01:02,688
I thought
she was very inventive.

16
00:01:02,688 --> 00:01:05,023
Please! The only reason
Miss Liebman recommended her

17
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:08,794
for this stupid scholarship
is 'cause she felt sorry
for her that Daddy died.

18
00:01:08,794 --> 00:01:10,561
Hey! Fuck you, Ellen!

19
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:12,463
At least I'm not working
at Carvel,

20
00:01:12,463 --> 00:01:14,733
hanging out at the mall,
and stealing lip gloss.

21
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:16,702
Enough, both of you!
Put that down!

22
00:01:16,702 --> 00:01:18,369
Turn it off, Ellen.
Enough!

23
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,709
Your sister is trying
something new.

24
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,210
Besides, after the year
we've had,

25
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,047
someone in this family
should have a little fun.

26
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:35,453
Welcome, campers.
If you haven't checked in yet.

27
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:37,889
Please report
to the dining room.

28
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:41,727
- Hey!
- Wow!

29
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:43,594
What a freak show.

30
00:01:43,594 --> 00:01:45,764
You can still sign up
for tonight's talent show.

31
00:01:45,764 --> 00:01:48,133
Sign-ups are
in the dance studio,

32
00:01:48,133 --> 00:01:51,302
and each performer
is limited to 10 minutes.

33
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:55,106
Ooh, check out Paddington Bear
at 10:00.

34
00:01:55,106 --> 00:01:57,508
There's your hot summer romance.

35
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,144
- Shut up.
- Ellen!

36
00:01:59,144 --> 00:02:01,747
Help your sister schlep the
duffel bag up to her wigwam.

37
00:02:01,747 --> 00:02:03,448
Teepee,
and I don't need any help.

38
00:02:03,448 --> 00:02:07,185
Maybe you can ask that strong
boy over there to help you.

39
00:02:07,185 --> 00:02:10,856
Oh, yeah, Julie, why don't you
go over and ask that strong boy?

40
00:02:10,856 --> 00:02:12,991
Hi. Need a hand?

41
00:02:12,991 --> 00:02:15,360
- No, thanks. I can do it.
- Cool.

42
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,429
- Ethan!
- My name's Ethan Figman.

43
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,766
If you need anything,
I'm at your service.

44
00:02:26,905 --> 00:02:29,775
Listen, Mom, it's five hours
to Underhill,

45
00:02:29,775 --> 00:02:31,009
and you'll have to stop
for lunch.

46
00:02:31,009 --> 00:02:32,778
She wants us to go, Mom.

47
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:34,012
Okay.

48
00:02:35,646 --> 00:02:38,383
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

49
00:02:38,383 --> 00:02:40,786
- I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

50
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:47,392
First time away from home.

51
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:50,461
You'll adjust.
It just takes time.

52
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,266
- Mom?
- I got this.

53
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:00,338
Mom!

54
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,582
* Don't you feel it growin' *

55
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:13,484
* Day by day *

56
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:17,823
* People gettin' ready
for the news *

57
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:20,525
* Some are happy *

58
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:22,127
* Some are sad *

59
00:03:22,127 --> 00:03:25,864
* Oh, we got to let
the music play *

60
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:32,337
You think Goodman Wolf
would let me sculpt him?

61
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,738
I mean, naked?

62
00:03:33,738 --> 00:03:36,908
This guy on the swim team
said his dick is so big

63
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,543
they nicknamed it Excalibur.

64
00:03:38,543 --> 00:03:40,846
You know,
like Sword and the Stone?

65
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:43,581
Thank you, Sandy, now
I will never be able
to listen to Camelot

66
00:03:43,581 --> 00:03:48,119
without imagining King Arthur
pulling his penis out of a rock.

67
00:03:48,119 --> 00:03:50,221
It's not like they think
they're better than everyone.

68
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:52,290
They just sort of are,
you know?

69
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:53,859
You make them sound like
they're royalty or something.

70
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,862
Well, they are, sort of.

71
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,864
Everybody comes here
with big dreams,

72
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,866
thinking they've got
some great talent,

73
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,434
until Ash Wolf
blows them away onstage,

74
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:05,403
or they hear one
of Jonah Dey's songs,

75
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:09,007
which are twice as good
as his mother's.

76
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:12,077
- Corinna Dey is his mother?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

77
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:14,145
He's gonna be twice as huge.

78
00:04:14,145 --> 00:04:17,048
And Cathy Kiplinger?

79
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:19,885
She's been dancing
since she was three.

80
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,519
Deep down,
everyone knows those guys

81
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,721
are the only ones
that are really gonna do it.

82
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:28,226
and not just as a hobby
or for a summer, but for life.

83
00:04:40,906 --> 00:04:43,208
Hmm, what smells so nice?

84
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:46,544
Um, it's Gee Your Hair
Smells Terrific.

85
00:04:46,544 --> 00:04:48,746
Too bad it looks like
a Brillo pad.

86
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,817
- Oh, come on.
- It's perfect
for removing rust,

87
00:04:52,817 --> 00:04:56,687
stripping paint,
scouring pots.

88
00:04:56,687 --> 00:04:58,789
- You're funny.
- It's the hair.

89
00:04:58,789 --> 00:05:01,626
I get it from a clown.

90
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,194
- I'm Ash Wolf.
- Oh, I know.

91
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:07,065
I mean, I'm Julie Jacobson.

92
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,967
- I know.
- You do?

93
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,668
We're in the same improv class.

94
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:13,638
You were hysterical
in that elevator exercise.

95
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:16,942
When you fainted,
and your legs spread wide open.

96
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,944
- I nearly peed myself laughing.
- Thanks.

97
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,946
It just came to me.

98
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,683
Listen, if you're not
doing anything later,

99
00:05:25,683 --> 00:05:29,154
a few of us are getting
together, and maybe you'd
like to join us.

100
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:33,058
Um... Yeah.

101
00:05:33,058 --> 00:05:34,960
- Sure. Cool.
- Great.

102
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,228
After lights out,
my brother's tent,
Teepee 3.

103
00:05:39,164 --> 00:05:41,566
It's the one
that reeks of weed.

104
00:05:43,834 --> 00:05:45,236
See you there.

105
00:05:51,742 --> 00:05:53,678
I'm not even that stoned yet.

106
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:58,083
- Goodman, leave it alone.
- "The Tin Drum"
is a literary masterpiece.

107
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,884
"House of Incest"
is female porn!

108
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:01,586
It's feminist surrealism!

109
00:06:01,586 --> 00:06:04,589
Where did you hear that?
From your fancy English teacher

110
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,324
with the Harvard PhD?

111
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:07,993
Günter Grass is basically God.

112
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,060
I think Anaïs Nin is God.

113
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,695
- Anaïs Nin?
- Yes.

114
00:06:10,695 --> 00:06:13,398
She's so full
of pretentious girly shit.

115
00:06:13,398 --> 00:06:15,700
She's literally one of
the worst writers to ever live.

116
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,504
Anaïs Nin and Günter Grass
both have umlauts.

117
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,872
Maybe that's the key
to their success.

118
00:06:21,872 --> 00:06:24,642
I'm thinking of getting
one for myself.

119
00:06:24,642 --> 00:06:27,145
Increase the velocity,
the natives are restless.

120
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:30,848
Voila.
Cannabis Perfectus.

121
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,584
What are you doing reading
Anaïs Nin anyway, Goodman?

122
00:06:33,584 --> 00:06:35,686
- Um, Ash made me.
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,223
And I do everything
that my sister tells me.

124
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,691
Maybe Ash is God.

125
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,528
Ash-- Ash is definitely not God.

126
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,763
All right, she's way too much
of a perfectionist.

127
00:06:45,763 --> 00:06:49,734
She'd never let a mistake
like Dick Nixon go unchecked.

128
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,302
I wish.

129
00:06:52,803 --> 00:06:56,507
The thing is, he's just such
a bad actor. He's so obvious.

130
00:06:56,507 --> 00:06:59,044
Why don't people see
when they're being lied to?

131
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,678
Because they don't wanna see.

132
00:07:00,678 --> 00:07:04,049
- Just look at My Lai.
- You sound like your mother.

133
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,650
- Fuck you, Goodman.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:07,185
At least Corinna uses her music
to tell the truth to the world.

135
00:07:07,185 --> 00:07:09,087
That's what art is for.

136
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,721
Right?

137
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,590
That's what "Spirit
in the Woods" is all about,

138
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:16,161
using your talent to tell
the truth to the world.

139
00:07:16,161 --> 00:07:20,431
Gosh, Ash, maybe you are God.

140
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:22,200
- No, don't!
- Maybe you are God, Ash.

141
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,169
- Ooh!
- You're not ticklish anymore?

142
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:25,903
- Stop!
- I don't know.

143
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,405
I just dance because I love it.

144
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,708
I've never really wanted
to do anything else...

145
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:34,812
except I'm probably fucked
because of these sacks of mail.

146
00:07:34,812 --> 00:07:38,783
I doubt your bodacious ta-tas
are gonna stand in your way.

147
00:07:38,783 --> 00:07:40,285
It's not funny, Goodman.

148
00:07:40,285 --> 00:07:41,986
How many ballerinas
do you know with big tits?

149
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:44,822
- Hey, calm down.
- What am I supposed to do?

150
00:07:44,822 --> 00:07:45,956
Quit?

151
00:07:45,956 --> 00:07:47,925
No, nothing should stand
in our way.

152
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,829
We should try to do
whatever we want to in life.

153
00:07:51,829 --> 00:07:53,598
What is the point otherwise?

154
00:07:56,801 --> 00:07:58,603
All right.

155
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:03,941
So, Jonah, have you given
any thought to a future career?

156
00:08:06,377 --> 00:08:08,579
There's a girl in our cousin's
school in Pennsylvania

157
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,449
- named Crema Semens.
- No.

158
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:14,419
- You made that up.
- No, she didn't.

159
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:17,988
Ash never lies.
It's one of the most
irritating things about her.

160
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:19,023
- Crema Semens?
- Yes.

161
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:22,393
It's like...
it's, like, a soup

162
00:08:22,393 --> 00:08:24,729
made from various strains
of semen.

163
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,934
- A medley of semen.
- Ew, Ethan, you're being
totally graphic.

164
00:08:29,934 --> 00:08:32,503
Well, he is a graphic artist.

165
00:08:32,503 --> 00:08:35,540
Hey, show her
some Planet Figman.

166
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,810
This is Wally Figman
and his horrible parents

167
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,313
before his mother runs off
with his pediatrician.

168
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,150
Any similarities between Wally's
life and my own

169
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,652
are purely intentional.

170
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,821
- The world according
to Ethan Figman.
- Can I see?

171
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:53,824
- **
- Which one's that?

172
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:56,294
I haven't seen that one.

173
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,799
I think we should all observe
a moment of silence

174
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,168
for Crema Semens.

175
00:09:06,571 --> 00:09:10,175
Well, the girl
from Long Island speaks.

176
00:09:10,175 --> 00:09:12,343
- Hey!
- You're being elitist.

177
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:16,181
Jacobson knows that I'm kidding.
Right, Long Island?

178
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,716
Oh, Crema Semens!

179
00:09:18,716 --> 00:09:20,185
Wherever thou art!

180
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,719
Your life will be tragic.

181
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:25,390
It will be cut short
in an accident involving

182
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:30,195
animal de-semenizing equipment.

183
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:35,233
See? I told you there was
a reason I brought her in.

184
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,502
- Desemenizing! Go, Jules!
- Go, Jules!

185
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:42,240
- Here you go, Jules.
- You have definitely
earned another toke.

186
00:09:44,509 --> 00:09:46,411
Every year we sit here
just like this.

187
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:48,213
Maybe we should name
ourselves something.

188
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,647
Why?
So everyone will know how

189
00:09:49,647 --> 00:09:52,250
just how unbelievably
interesting we are?

190
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,553
The Interestings.

191
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,988
That works!

192
00:09:57,988 --> 00:09:59,990
From this day forward,

193
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:03,428
because we are clearly
the most interesting people

194
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,763
- whoever fucking lived.
- Fuck, yes.

195
00:10:05,763 --> 00:10:09,133
Because our lives
are so compelling.

196
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:13,037
Because our brains are
so swollen

197
00:10:13,037 --> 00:10:15,105
with intellectual thoughts.

198
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:18,676
Let us henceforth be known
as the Interestings!

199
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:24,382
Let everyone who sees us
be blinded

200
00:10:24,382 --> 00:10:28,919
by our brilliant
and scintillating lives.

201
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:34,091
- Come on.
- Oh, thank you.

202
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:39,764
- Toast to the Interestings!
- To our scintillating lives!

203
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,266
Whoo!

204
00:10:45,836 --> 00:10:48,539
You sure you don't wanna come?
I can still get the sitter.

205
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,643
It'll be good
to get out, you know?

206
00:10:52,643 --> 00:10:56,013
Get some air, see people.

207
00:10:56,013 --> 00:10:58,916
I see people everyday
in the park with Rorie.

208
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,319
I'm on a first-name basis
with every nanny

209
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:03,821
and alcoholic mom
on the Upper West Side.

210
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:05,823
Everyone's gonna be
asking for you.

211
00:11:05,823 --> 00:11:08,326
Jules, I've got
the interview tomorrow.

212
00:11:08,326 --> 00:11:11,396
- I just want to veg.
- Veging's good.
Wish I could veg.

213
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:13,097
Probably gonna be
a snooze fest anyway.

214
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:16,033
You know how Ethan goes on
at these things.

215
00:11:16,033 --> 00:11:17,402
You look nice.

216
00:11:17,402 --> 00:11:19,704
Can you see it's ripped
in the shoulder?

217
00:11:19,704 --> 00:11:23,608
- No, not at all.
- Thank God for safety pins.

218
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,379
Say hi to the gang
for me.

219
00:11:28,379 --> 00:11:31,015
Tell them we'll
have dinner soon.
I'll cook.

220
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:38,323
Hey, listen. Be good and do
everything your daddy says.

221
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,659
Okay? I'll be home
when you wake up.

222
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:50,034
You forgot to kiss Daddy.

223
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,172
Pucker up, Daddy.

224
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,342
I love you.

225
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,844
Don't obsess, hmm?

226
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,779
I love you, too.

227
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:29,407
* Take a straight
and stronger course *

228
00:12:29,407 --> 00:12:33,043
* To the corner
of your life *

229
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,381
* Make the white queen
run so fast *

230
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:42,186
I mean, Ethan is
a great guy, I know.

231
00:12:42,186 --> 00:12:44,389
He is incredibly smart.

232
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,091
- And totally honest.
- So is Winnie the Pooh,

233
00:12:47,091 --> 00:12:50,227
- but I wouldn't fuck him.
- You're horrible.

234
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,796
- I'm serious.
- Sorry.

235
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:54,131
Look, it's nothing personal.
It's just the truth.

236
00:12:54,131 --> 00:12:58,536
People are attracted to their
own levels of attractiveness.

237
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:01,772
Like me and your brother,
and you and Jonah.

238
00:13:01,772 --> 00:13:04,174
I mean, Ethan will probably
end up with someone

239
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:09,914
incredibly brilliant
and badly disfigured.

240
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,817
Cathy!

241
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:14,084
She's horrible.

242
00:13:16,053 --> 00:13:19,957
Seriously, you wouldn't go out
with him if he asked you?

243
00:13:19,957 --> 00:13:22,460
I don't know.
I don't think so.

244
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,862
- Would you?
- Ash and Ethan?

245
00:13:24,862 --> 00:13:28,866
I mean that's
like Beauty and the Beast.

246
00:13:28,866 --> 00:13:30,635
I don't know.

247
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,937
I can't imagine myself
with anyone other than Jonah.

248
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,773
- Yeah. Okay.
- We're just so right
for each other, you know?

249
00:13:40,077 --> 00:13:42,480
Jesus, Jonah, get a room.

250
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,883
Guess who finally agreed
to move in with me?

251
00:13:45,883 --> 00:13:49,554
- Who?
- Me. It's me.

252
00:13:49,554 --> 00:13:52,256
Really? Oh, my God!

253
00:13:52,256 --> 00:13:56,827
- It's about time.
- Some things can't be rushed.

254
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:01,466
I admire your perseverance.

255
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,900
If he had let you go,

256
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,335
we were all ready to have
an intervention again.

257
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,672
You've got
such fabulous friends.

258
00:14:07,672 --> 00:14:09,907
God bless that faggot camp
you went to.

259
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:14,945
Congratulations to the winners
of our silent auction,

260
00:14:14,945 --> 00:14:19,149
especially the new owner of--

261
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,951
...the Wally Figman
punching bag!

262
00:14:24,354 --> 00:14:28,025
Certain to save you
thousands in therapy bills.

263
00:14:28,025 --> 00:14:31,729
But if you leave here with
nothing but our gratitude,

264
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,498
just know that
what you're doing tonight

265
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,066
is making a real difference.

266
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:39,870
If you don't believe me,
ask the true conscience

267
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:43,207
of the Figman Foundation,
my beautiful wife, Ash Wolf.

268
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:53,984
Ash has seen firsthand what
Doctors Without Borders--

269
00:14:53,984 --> 00:14:55,820
I can't believe
you guys were a thing.

270
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:59,824
It was never that sexual.

271
00:14:59,824 --> 00:15:02,893
- We were more like--
- Sisters?

272
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:07,798
I was gonna say lesbians.

273
00:15:07,798 --> 00:15:10,234
Lastly, I'd love to thank
the gang at Figland for
their generous support.

274
00:15:14,939 --> 00:15:18,108
Pardon, good sirs,
the Queen of Figlandia beckons.

275
00:15:18,108 --> 00:15:20,010
I shall return anon.

276
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,680
So, yeah, make sure
to eat the food.

277
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,550
I can personally recommend
the tiramisu.

278
00:15:36,426 --> 00:15:38,563
Wow. This one's new.

279
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:41,599
"If only I were President
of Figland.

280
00:15:41,599 --> 00:15:44,034
With respect, Bill."

281
00:15:44,034 --> 00:15:46,203
Oh, I can't believe
I missed that weekend

282
00:15:46,203 --> 00:15:48,405
because Rorie had
that 104 fever.

283
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,341
I should have just sold her
to gypsies and come anyway.

284
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,943
I have to go to Iceland.

285
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,881
Goodman's in trouble.

286
00:15:56,881 --> 00:16:00,084
- What's going on?
- He's fucked up, Jules.

287
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,987
He's got no money.
For all I know,
he's living on the streets.

288
00:16:02,987 --> 00:16:06,591
- He sounded confused.
- I think he's using again.

289
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,226
- Your parents gonna go?
- They can't.

290
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,596
The doctor says
my mom can't travel,

291
00:16:11,596 --> 00:16:14,899
and my dad doesn't want
to leave her, so...

292
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:18,268
He's still making a mess
of his life and ours.

293
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:22,773
- I'm so sorry, Ash.
- She's desperate to see him.

294
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,141
It's so sad.

295
00:16:26,644 --> 00:16:28,979
I told Ethan I had
to go to Bali

296
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,716
to research these masks for
a production of "Midsummer."

297
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:34,719
You told him you're going
to Indonesia

298
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:38,055
to get masks for
a play set in Greece

299
00:16:38,055 --> 00:16:40,190
that you're doing
in Lower Manhattan?

300
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:44,094
I know. I told him
it was part of my concept.

301
00:16:44,094 --> 00:16:46,330
I feel badly than I'm missing

302
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:49,299
this Museum of Broadcasting
thing they're doing
in his honor,

303
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:53,638
and I told him I'd see
if you could go in my place.

304
00:16:56,907 --> 00:17:00,410
I hate this.
I really do.

305
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,812
- I--
- I do.

306
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:05,282
Just fucking tell him already.

307
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:07,351
I can't do that.
You know I can't.

308
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:09,053
He'd be devastated.

309
00:17:09,053 --> 00:17:12,189
You should have told him
before you got married,
or I should have.

310
00:17:12,189 --> 00:17:14,258
We couldn't take the chance.
You know how he is.

311
00:17:14,258 --> 00:17:17,662
He's never really believed
Goodman was innocent.

312
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,297
It's fine.
I'll go.

313
00:17:20,297 --> 00:17:23,901
What's one more lie
amongst friends, right?

314
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:27,204
- Was I that boring?
- No!

315
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:29,406
No, if I had any money
to spare,

316
00:17:29,406 --> 00:17:31,208
I would have stayed
until the hat was passed,

317
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,743
but alas, I hate passing up
a passed hat.

318
00:17:32,743 --> 00:17:34,144
I forgive you.

319
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:35,880
You get a pass for passing up
the passed hat

320
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,381
as long as it's in the past.

321
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:39,049
I really hate it
when you guys do this.

322
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:40,550
I know.

323
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,787
That's what makes it
so much fun.

324
00:17:42,787 --> 00:17:44,454
I wish she'd let me
auction her off.

325
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:47,191
What? there are so many things
wrong with that sentence.

326
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,860
Strictly look but don't touch.
Just dinner and drinks

327
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,762
with the most beautiful woman
in Manhattan.

328
00:17:51,762 --> 00:17:53,530
We'd make a killing.

329
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,232
We'd never have to throw one
of these awful things again.

330
00:17:55,232 --> 00:17:58,703
What do you say?
Take one for the team.

331
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:00,738
Where's Dennis?
I thought he was coming.

332
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:03,774
Oh, Rorie has a cold,
but he sends his love.

333
00:18:03,774 --> 00:18:06,777
Guess what?
Jules can go to the Museum
of Broadcasting with you.

334
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:09,013
Really? That's fantastic.

335
00:18:09,013 --> 00:18:11,515
Oh, it will be just like
old times.

336
00:18:11,515 --> 00:18:13,250
Just the two of us.

337
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,753
Yeah, and afterwards,
we can go to that restaurant

338
00:18:15,753 --> 00:18:18,723
- that Robert De Niro
keeps talking about.
- No fair!

339
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:23,060
That's what you get for having
the gall to choose your career
over mine.

340
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,562
I mean, who goes to Indonesia

341
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,365
to get masks for a Greek play
she's doing in the Village?

342
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:31,401
It's a concept, right?

343
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,338
Well, we better get
back out there

344
00:18:34,338 --> 00:18:36,373
while there are still pockets
to be picked.

345
00:18:36,373 --> 00:18:38,475
Ah, yes.
These things are gonna kill me.

346
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:41,011
But that's what I get
for marrying a saint.

347
00:18:48,518 --> 00:18:50,755
What would I do
without you?

348
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,057
The law is very clear.

349
00:18:53,057 --> 00:18:54,825
Anyone who hinders or delays

350
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:57,194
The discovery of
Goodman Wolf's whereabouts

351
00:18:57,194 --> 00:18:59,797
is guilty of harboring
a fugitive.

352
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:02,900
Detective, if we knew
where my son was,

353
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,503
we would insist
he turn himself in.

354
00:19:06,503 --> 00:19:09,406
Good. 'Cause it doesn't get
any better for him.

355
00:19:09,406 --> 00:19:13,944
Fugitive warrants
don't expire ever.

356
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,545
Until he comes back
to stand trial,

357
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:18,648
he will be considered
a wanted criminal.

358
00:19:18,648 --> 00:19:23,120
Listen, did it ever occur
to you that we are missing
our son?

359
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,022
We've lost our son.
We don't know if he's alive.

360
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:29,359
Please try to find
a little compassion.

361
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:34,098
I'm sorry, Mr. Wolf.
I can see you're a close family,

362
00:19:34,098 --> 00:19:37,501
which is probably why I think
you will hear from Goodman soon,

363
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:39,904
if you haven't already.

364
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,006
But just bear in mind
that when you do,

365
00:19:42,006 --> 00:19:43,407
you are legally required
to contact us.

366
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:46,010
And if you don't,
you will go to jail.

367
00:19:55,285 --> 00:19:58,422
God, they're like
the Gestapo.

368
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:01,425
Instead of barging into
your home and intimidating you,

369
00:20:01,425 --> 00:20:03,327
they should be out there
trying to find Goodman.

370
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,295
We can handle this, Jules.
Thanks.

371
00:20:05,295 --> 00:20:06,096
No, we can't.

372
00:20:06,096 --> 00:20:07,998
- Ash.
- I can't.

373
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,900
You have Mom to talk to,
but who do I have?

374
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,602
- This is a family matter.
- Jules is family.
We can trust her.

375
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,973
- Ash, please.
- We've been in touch with
Goodman and we know where he is.

376
00:20:15,973 --> 00:20:19,343
Jesus Christ, Ash!
I hope your happy!

377
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:22,146
'Cause now our lives are in
the hands of a 16-year-old!

378
00:20:22,146 --> 00:20:25,415
No, I'll be careful,
Mr. Wolf, I promise.

379
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:26,483
You didn't tell Ethan?

380
00:20:26,483 --> 00:20:28,785
No, I couldn't. I mean,
you know how he is.

381
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:30,620
He'd probably think he had
to report it or something.

382
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,222
No, you're the only one.

383
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,392
And nothing leaves
this room

384
00:20:35,392 --> 00:20:37,928
until we can prove
Goodman's innocence.

385
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:53,143
- So what do you think?
- It's fantastic.

386
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:56,013
- Not too much?
- I'd hire you.

387
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:57,882
Or at least sleep with you.

388
00:20:57,882 --> 00:21:00,284
You don't think
I'm too overdressed?
Maybe I should just wear jeans.

389
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:01,518
No!

390
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:05,489
I think you look really nice,
very professional.

391
00:21:05,489 --> 00:21:07,324
I got a good feeling
about this, Jules.
I really do.

392
00:21:07,324 --> 00:21:09,093
Me, too.
You're gonna be great.

393
00:21:09,093 --> 00:21:11,128
Too many things about it
are just so right, you know?

394
00:21:11,128 --> 00:21:13,898
- I do.
- The clinic's on the west side.

395
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,000
I'm great with
sonographic scanners.

396
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,701
And the fact that they're
looking for someone

397
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:20,204
who's had
experience with obstetric
and gynecologic ultrasounds.

398
00:21:20,204 --> 00:21:22,940
They would be lucky
to have you, Dennis, really.

399
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,110
- Nothing to be nervous about.
- I'm not.

400
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,512
Good, 'cause
you shouldn't be.

401
00:21:28,512 --> 00:21:33,517
Keep breathing and be yourself.
You look great, Den.

402
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,920
You really do.

403
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,122
I'm gonna nail this fucker.

404
00:21:38,122 --> 00:21:41,125
- You said the "F" word.
- All right.

405
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:42,759
Don't have to be a wisenheimer.

406
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,095
Go give your daddy a kiss.
Wish him good luck.

407
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,770
* Baby, we can do it *

408
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,772
* Take the time,
do it right *

409
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:58,042
* We can do it, baby *

410
00:21:58,042 --> 00:22:00,177
* Do it tonight *

411
00:22:00,177 --> 00:22:01,678
* Baby, we can do it *

412
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:03,847
* Take the time,
do it right *

413
00:22:03,847 --> 00:22:06,283
* We can do it, baby *

414
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,152
* Do it tonight *

415
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:30,140
Is it me, or is sex, like,

416
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:35,312
so much better than
when we were in college?

417
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,415
I'm not sure.
Maybe we should try it again

418
00:22:38,415 --> 00:22:40,450
and confirm your hypothesis.

419
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:42,686
No!

420
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:49,426
No, you're amazing.
You have some serious skills.

421
00:22:49,426 --> 00:22:52,997
But there are other factors
to consider, you know?

422
00:22:52,997 --> 00:22:55,265
Okay, like what?

423
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:59,069
Well, look at us.

424
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:04,108
I'm looking.

425
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:08,812
I mean, our bodies, they
may not be perfect, perfect,

426
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:10,680
but they're probably more
perfect than they'll ever be

427
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,350
for the rest of our lives,
you know?

428
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,420
Okay. That's really
depressing, Jules.

429
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,789
Yeah, but it's true, right?

430
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,327
And we're not all insecure
and fumbling around,

431
00:23:23,327 --> 00:23:25,029
like when we were in college,
you know?

432
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:29,266
Well, you know,
I've been practicing
a lot since graduation,

433
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:31,035
Of course,
most of it's been by myself.

434
00:23:32,336 --> 00:23:34,671
But you know what
they say about practice.

435
00:23:38,142 --> 00:23:41,278
I can't. I have to go.

436
00:23:41,278 --> 00:23:43,747
I'm gonna be late
for work again.

437
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,624
So when am I gonna
see you again?

438
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,061
Um, I don't know.

439
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:59,163
I have to figure out
what my work schedule is

440
00:23:59,163 --> 00:24:02,766
and prepare this thing
for acting class.

441
00:24:02,766 --> 00:24:05,669
I bet you're a great actress.

442
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,105
I really admire you,
Jules, you know?

443
00:24:08,105 --> 00:24:10,140
Going after your dream,
working your butt off.

444
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,810
Well, you're doing
the same thing, right?

445
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:15,712
I mean,
you're not gonna be a lab tech

446
00:24:15,712 --> 00:24:17,914
for the rest of your life,
right?

447
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,617
I don't know.
The work's pretty cool,

448
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,152
and the hours are great,
you know?

449
00:24:22,152 --> 00:24:23,653
I get to spend time
with my friends

450
00:24:23,653 --> 00:24:25,189
and play ball with
some of the guys from work.

451
00:24:25,189 --> 00:24:27,757
I think I actually
really lucked out.

452
00:24:31,628 --> 00:24:33,730
I think that's great

453
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,699
that you're so content.

454
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,769
I mean, if a lab tech
is what you wanna be--

455
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:43,107
Is not what I wanna be,
it's just what I'm doing.

456
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,109
For now. It's my job.

457
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:46,610
Maybe one day
I'll wanna do something else,

458
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:49,546
but for the moment,
it really makes me happy,
you know?

459
00:24:49,546 --> 00:24:54,251
- We can't all be Hackneys.
- Who?

460
00:24:54,251 --> 00:24:56,686
That guy who's exhibit we went
to who paints all those swimming
pools.

461
00:24:56,686 --> 00:25:00,224
- Hockney. David Hockney.
- Right. We can't
all be Hockneys.

462
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:02,692
Or Jacobsons.
Some of us have other gifts.

463
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:09,999
- Stop it.
- It's your fault.

464
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:13,237
You and your perfect body.
Hey, come by the park tomorrow.

465
00:25:13,237 --> 00:25:14,571
We got a game
in the late afternoon.

466
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:16,506
I don't know.
I'll try.

467
00:25:16,506 --> 00:25:20,510
Well, we will be thinking
of you.

468
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:28,252
So when are we
going to meet him?

469
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:30,154
What's wrong with him?
Is he married?

470
00:25:30,154 --> 00:25:31,321
- No.
- Is he deformed?

471
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,889
Ethan.

472
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:34,158
He's Republican.

473
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,492
- Mm-hmm.
- Jesus.

474
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,795
He's a-- a fuck buddy.
Okay?

475
00:25:38,795 --> 00:25:41,831
I'm sorry to be so crude,
but that's all he is.

476
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,167
Nobody cares, Jules.

477
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,768
It's just you've
been seeing him

478
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:45,935
for, like, three months,

479
00:25:45,935 --> 00:25:47,471
which surpasses
the official

480
00:25:47,471 --> 00:25:49,173
fuck buddy time limit.

481
00:25:49,173 --> 00:25:50,640
What are you
talking about?

482
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,376
It's impossible
to allow someone

483
00:25:52,376 --> 00:25:55,612
access to your vagina
for three consecutive
months

484
00:25:55,612 --> 00:25:58,215
and not develop
some feelings for them.

485
00:25:58,215 --> 00:26:01,185
Okay, no more
Dr. Ruth for you.

486
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,952
Look, he's a very nice guy,

487
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:05,255
but we have zero in common.

488
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:08,258
And he's a lab
technician, okay?

489
00:26:08,258 --> 00:26:10,327
He's the guy who squirts
jelly on your belly

490
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:11,761
and takes X-rays.

491
00:26:11,761 --> 00:26:13,930
He's not exactly Proust,
if you know what I mean.

492
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:15,999
- I've never read Proust.
- Me, either.

493
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:17,434
Okay, neither have I,

494
00:26:17,434 --> 00:26:19,703
but the point is we could.

495
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,070
So he's blind?

496
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,472
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Ethan.

497
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:26,210
He's part of your life,
Jules, for however long.

498
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,745
Since when do we keep
secrets from each other?

499
00:26:32,115 --> 00:26:33,417
Bring him to dinner next week

500
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:34,918
when we celebrate
Ethan's first paycheck.

501
00:26:34,918 --> 00:26:36,220
Yeah, I've never met

502
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,854
a bona fide fuck buddy
before, so--

503
00:26:37,854 --> 00:26:39,656
Look, I know I sound
like a big fat snob,

504
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:42,526
but I just think
I can do better, okay?

505
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:45,529
I mean, I want
to be with somebody

506
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:47,597
who wants to do something
important with his life, right?

507
00:26:47,597 --> 00:26:50,066
I'm playing a mermaid
for one week

508
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,535
outside the New York Aquarium.

509
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:53,537
You are being paid to act.

510
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:55,905
And you just got a job
on a network television show.

511
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:58,542
It's an animated
piece of shit, Jules.
Have you seen it?

512
00:26:58,542 --> 00:27:01,044
The point is you're
going somewhere,

513
00:27:01,044 --> 00:27:02,346
and so am I.

514
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:05,249
Not getting there as fast
as you two, clearly,

515
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:07,517
but I'm aspiring,

516
00:27:07,517 --> 00:27:10,520
and frankly, I don't want
to be with somebody who isn't.

517
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,889
I mean, we're artists, right?

518
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,559
What about your tits?

519
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,897
Your nipples.

520
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:24,734
Uh...

521
00:27:24,734 --> 00:27:27,337
you do know where your
nipples are, don't you?

522
00:27:27,337 --> 00:27:30,274
Do not look at Miss Wolf.

523
00:27:30,274 --> 00:27:31,508
She can't help you.

524
00:27:31,508 --> 00:27:32,909
You're the one
in the shower.

525
00:27:34,711 --> 00:27:36,346
Now take the soap

526
00:27:36,346 --> 00:27:38,915
and wash your asshole.

527
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,961
Your pussy.

528
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,664
Oh, excuse me.
Your vagina.

529
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,411
You know, I hope

530
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:09,846
that you really do wash
your private parts

531
00:28:09,846 --> 00:28:12,015
on occasion.

532
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:16,320
You think that's funny?

533
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:18,422
Do you?

534
00:28:19,956 --> 00:28:22,626
I don't. I think it's sad.

535
00:28:24,193 --> 00:28:25,462
You want to be actors?

536
00:28:25,462 --> 00:28:29,333
Why? To become stars?

537
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:32,402
Or to hold a mirror
up to nature,

538
00:28:32,402 --> 00:28:35,372
to show what it means
to be human?

539
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:37,607
That's what
this exercise is about:

540
00:28:37,607 --> 00:28:39,343
to be willing
to be brave enough

541
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:41,445
to be private in public,

542
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:45,682
to risk revealing
your own humanity.

543
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,418
The audience pays you

544
00:28:48,418 --> 00:28:51,154
to show them who they
really are inside

545
00:28:51,154 --> 00:28:54,223
because they're too busy
or they're too frightened

546
00:28:54,223 --> 00:28:56,059
to look.

547
00:28:56,059 --> 00:29:00,129
But if you walk on that stage
looking for approval,

548
00:29:00,129 --> 00:29:02,799
you're cheating them.

549
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,601
You're not acting.

550
00:29:07,771 --> 00:29:09,105
You're begging.

551
00:29:09,105 --> 00:29:14,010
You, Ms. Jacobson,
are a beggar.

552
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,380
You don't want to be seen.

553
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,448
You just want to be liked.

554
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:20,884
You're an approval junkie.

555
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,753
To me, that is sad.

556
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:29,526
You're an approval junkie.

557
00:29:29,526 --> 00:29:31,294
You care too much
what others think of you.

558
00:29:31,294 --> 00:29:32,496
We know this.

559
00:29:32,496 --> 00:29:35,098
It's what you think
that matters.

560
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:37,200
You need
to find your voice

561
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,469
and listen to it.

562
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:43,807
I'm leaving you.

563
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,212
I'm sorry.

564
00:29:49,212 --> 00:29:51,848
I don't think talk therapy
is that effective--

565
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:53,049
for me, anyway.

566
00:29:53,049 --> 00:29:54,718
Uh, I-- I think it's time

567
00:29:54,718 --> 00:29:57,687
for me to try
something else.

568
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,392
Well, I think it's...

569
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:04,394
interesting
that you want to leave

570
00:30:04,394 --> 00:30:07,263
just as we're
starting to understand
the underlying issues.

571
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,066
What's the point
of understanding
why you're miserable

572
00:30:10,066 --> 00:30:11,568
if you're still miserable?

573
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:13,269
It's like the booby prize.

574
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,672
I disagree, Shauna.

575
00:30:15,672 --> 00:30:19,208
I have seen tangible
behavioral improvement in you.

576
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:21,110
You've been
so much more confident

577
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,345
and more optimistic.

578
00:30:24,047 --> 00:30:25,815
I'm taking Prozac.

579
00:30:27,717 --> 00:30:29,619
My doctor
prescribed it for me.

580
00:30:31,187 --> 00:30:32,656
Okay.

581
00:30:33,657 --> 00:30:35,358
I wish you'd told me.

582
00:30:35,358 --> 00:30:37,226
You obviously feel
it's helping?

583
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:40,664
Well, if I wasn't taking it,

584
00:30:40,664 --> 00:30:42,932
I don't think I'd have
the courage to leave you.

585
00:31:23,707 --> 00:31:25,408
Can I help you?

586
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:26,876
Uh, sure.

587
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:28,244
Is this good?

588
00:31:28,244 --> 00:31:29,779
Good for what?

589
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:32,516
Uh, my husband. New job.

590
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:35,519
Is it paying six figures?

591
00:31:37,086 --> 00:31:38,522
No.

592
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,689
Good enough.

593
00:31:45,529 --> 00:31:47,664
Julie Jacobson.

594
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,268
You don't recognize me.

595
00:31:52,268 --> 00:31:56,139
Maybe if I was mixing
a couple vodka Tangs.

596
00:31:56,139 --> 00:31:59,175
Oh, my God. Cathy?

597
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:01,077
I didn't even--

598
00:32:01,077 --> 00:32:03,179
Wow.

599
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:04,548
You look great.

600
00:32:04,548 --> 00:32:05,982
Thank you.

601
00:32:05,982 --> 00:32:08,552
I guess I'm just
blessed with good genes.

602
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:11,855
Oh, I trimmed
those mail bags down

603
00:32:11,855 --> 00:32:14,323
when I was dancing with
Paul Taylor's company.

604
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:17,060
Didn't make the big difference
I was hoping for, though.

605
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,929
I'm in finance now,
but I don't miss them.

606
00:32:19,929 --> 00:32:22,298
Although he might.
My big tits.

607
00:32:22,298 --> 00:32:24,267
Ah.

608
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:27,303
This is Julie Jacobson.

609
00:32:27,303 --> 00:32:28,371
Hi.

610
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:30,039
We were at camp
together.

611
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:31,941
She was
part of that group.

612
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:34,911
Huh.

613
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:39,148
So you and Ash
are still best buds?

614
00:32:39,148 --> 00:32:43,219
Uh, I don't know about that,
but we do speak occasionally.

615
00:32:43,219 --> 00:32:46,122
According to Ethan,
it's more than just
occasionally.

616
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,759
He calls me
every now and then.

617
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,861
It's been a few years,

618
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:54,764
but at least one of you
had the decency to care.

619
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:57,100
It's a complicated
time, Cathy.

620
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,835
Bullshit.

621
00:32:58,835 --> 00:33:01,370
But then it must be
very hard to see clearly

622
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,106
with your lips glued
to Ash's ass.

623
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,375
I'm sorry you feel that way.

624
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,744
No, you're not.

625
00:33:07,744 --> 00:33:09,613
You don't
give a shit how I feel.

626
00:33:11,615 --> 00:33:15,118
So no one's ever heard
from Goodman?

627
00:33:17,253 --> 00:33:19,088
I don't think so, no.

628
00:33:19,088 --> 00:33:20,489
Amazing, huh?

629
00:33:20,489 --> 00:33:22,626
He just disappeared.

630
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,928
No body found.
Never contacted anyone,

631
00:33:24,928 --> 00:33:27,897
not even his nearest
and dearest.

632
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:32,301
I guess not.

633
00:33:33,637 --> 00:33:34,938
Well,
it doesn't mean he won't,

634
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,239
does it?

635
00:33:36,239 --> 00:33:38,541
I know you were all
goo-goo over him,

636
00:33:38,541 --> 00:33:39,843
so maybe he'll come back

637
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:41,210
and carry you off
into the sunset,

638
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:43,379
or maybe he'll just
fuck up your life

639
00:33:43,379 --> 00:33:44,681
like he did mine.

640
00:33:44,681 --> 00:33:46,215
- You ready, hon?
- Yeah, yeah.

641
00:33:46,215 --> 00:33:47,751
Let's get out of here.

642
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:50,654
We're, uh, celebrating
my big promotion.

643
00:33:50,654 --> 00:33:52,188
Senior VP
at Kanter-Fitzgerald.

644
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:54,758
Just crashing through
the proverbial glass ceiling.

645
00:33:54,758 --> 00:33:56,359
That's right.

646
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:57,326
Well...

647
00:33:59,128 --> 00:34:01,998
your life doesn't look
that fucked up to me.

648
00:34:03,266 --> 00:34:05,935
You never did understand.

649
00:34:05,935 --> 00:34:07,170
Did you?

650
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,281
Your parents leave?

651
00:34:19,582 --> 00:34:21,284
Hour ago.

652
00:34:21,284 --> 00:34:23,219
Right after Ash's big show.

653
00:34:24,921 --> 00:34:27,090
So what are you
doing here?

654
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:29,693
Fuck if I know.

655
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,701
They should fucking
outlaw visiting weekend.

656
00:34:37,701 --> 00:34:39,202
Really.

657
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:43,506
Except your parents
seem so, you know...

658
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:45,474
Charming?

659
00:34:45,474 --> 00:34:48,845
Intelligent?
Cosmo-fucking-politan?

660
00:35:08,865 --> 00:35:11,300
I showed them my
urban planning project.

661
00:35:12,301 --> 00:35:14,403
My mother smiled,
sort of confused,

662
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,972
and said
it was very nice.

663
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,908
My father asked me
if I figured out a way

664
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,343
to keep the buildings
from collapsing.

665
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:21,878
Oh, I'm sure he didn't
mean it like--

666
00:35:21,878 --> 00:35:23,179
Oh, he meant it.

667
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,490
Great expectations suck.

668
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:36,092
Let me tell you.

669
00:35:39,495 --> 00:35:40,797
It's hard
to live up to them

670
00:35:40,797 --> 00:35:42,131
unless you're Ash.

671
00:35:46,069 --> 00:35:48,905
You'll have the last
laugh, you know.

672
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:53,109
You're going to be another
Frank Lloyd Wright.

673
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,311
There's not a doubt
in my mind.

674
00:36:00,083 --> 00:36:02,151
You're funny, Jacobson.

675
00:36:04,988 --> 00:36:06,489
And you made it
to the inner circle.

676
00:36:06,489 --> 00:36:08,457
Not many people do that.

677
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:11,961
Good for you.

678
00:36:25,408 --> 00:36:26,910
Goodman?

679
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,812
Goodman,
where the fuck are you?

680
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:29,979
Keep your tits on.

681
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,381
I'm giving Jacobson here
a pep talk.

682
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:37,453
This never happened.

683
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,293
What did she
need a pep talk for?

684
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:45,829
Nothing.

685
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:06,850
Where's Rorie?

686
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,953
Downstairs with Sophie.
They're having Chinese.

687
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:18,494
I guess
it didn't go so well?

688
00:37:18,494 --> 00:37:20,296
It was a fucking disaster.

689
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,268
What happened?

690
00:37:25,268 --> 00:37:28,471
She asked me
why I left my last job

691
00:37:28,471 --> 00:37:30,940
and what I'd been doing
in the interim.

692
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,641
You knew that would
probably come up.

693
00:37:32,641 --> 00:37:34,743
You were prepared.

694
00:37:34,743 --> 00:37:37,881
It was the first
thing that came up.

695
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:39,983
The only thing that came up.

696
00:37:39,983 --> 00:37:41,951
She takes one look
at my résumé,

697
00:37:41,951 --> 00:37:44,720
and she notices the huge gap
in my employment record.

698
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,222
How could she not?

699
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,057
And she asked me
why I left Medfair

700
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,658
and what I'd been doing.

701
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:51,394
I told her that I left

702
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:52,929
because I wanted
to take some time off

703
00:37:52,929 --> 00:37:54,497
to be with my daughter
while my wife worked.

704
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:57,901
And she asked me who my boss
was when I was there.

705
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,937
"Was it Karen Wallace?"
she asked.

706
00:38:00,937 --> 00:38:03,672
Whom she knows very well,
she said.

707
00:38:03,672 --> 00:38:06,575
Basically letting me know
that she would call Karen

708
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,911
and find out what happened,

709
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,578
so I might as well
just tell her,

710
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,514
which I then proceeded to do.

711
00:38:13,516 --> 00:38:15,118
I told her
about what happened,

712
00:38:15,118 --> 00:38:16,552
the reason I was fired.

713
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:20,990
You should have
seen her face.

714
00:38:25,929 --> 00:38:27,730
What did she say?

715
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,532
She said...

716
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:32,735
"Thank you for coming in

717
00:38:32,735 --> 00:38:34,403
and for being so honest."

718
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:38,607
Well, I think it's great
that you went in.

719
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:39,608
I do.

720
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,711
I mean,
you got back out there,

721
00:38:42,711 --> 00:38:44,113
which is a huge
accomplishment.

722
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,950
I think you should
feel good about that.

723
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,818
Is that how you talk
to your patients?

724
00:38:49,818 --> 00:38:52,455
Like they're fucking
12 years old?

725
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,992
It's like I'm
some disabled child

726
00:38:55,992 --> 00:38:58,561
that you're helping
to get through the day.

727
00:38:58,561 --> 00:39:00,296
That's not how I feel.

728
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,965
Well,
that is how it sounds.

729
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,732
Oh, God.

730
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,468
I fucking hate it.

731
00:39:08,204 --> 00:39:10,506
I never
should have married you.

732
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:17,346
You should have trusted
your instincts.

733
00:39:34,397 --> 00:39:35,764
Mm.

734
00:39:35,764 --> 00:39:37,233
May I have another?

735
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:40,736
Behold the bounty that
selling out hath wrought.

736
00:39:40,736 --> 00:39:42,771
560 big ones.

737
00:39:42,771 --> 00:39:44,107
We're rich!

738
00:39:44,107 --> 00:39:45,508
- Rich.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

739
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:48,444
And all it took
was selling my soul.

740
00:39:48,444 --> 00:39:51,180
Really? Where do I
sign up to sell mine?

741
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,082
To the sweet smell of success.

742
00:39:53,082 --> 00:39:55,784
May we all reek of it soon.

743
00:39:55,784 --> 00:39:56,986
Hey.

744
00:39:56,986 --> 00:39:58,421
- Mm.
- Mm.

745
00:39:58,421 --> 00:40:00,489
Slow down, Jules.
It's going to be fine.

746
00:40:00,489 --> 00:40:02,258
I never should have
invited him.

747
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:03,826
Seriously,
it was a mistake.

748
00:40:03,826 --> 00:40:05,294
- I know.
- Hey, hey. Relax.

749
00:40:05,294 --> 00:40:06,795
All right? We're not
going to eat him alive.

750
00:40:06,795 --> 00:40:08,364
It just sends
the wrong message.

751
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,832
It's not fair
to him, either.

752
00:40:09,832 --> 00:40:11,267
Oh, God, he's here.

753
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:12,801
Oh, shit, I knew
he'd wear that.

754
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:14,203
Hey.

755
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,039
Hey, you made it.

756
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,173
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

757
00:40:17,173 --> 00:40:18,507
I was, like,
glued to the TV.

758
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:19,975
Ewing just hit
a buzzer beater.

759
00:40:19,975 --> 00:40:21,710
Put the Lakers away.
Ha ha!

760
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,911
That's another
20-point game.

761
00:40:22,911 --> 00:40:24,413
Even if the Knicks
finish fifth,

762
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:27,316
there is no way this man
is not Rookie of the Year.

763
00:40:27,316 --> 00:40:31,154
It's not the champagne
you get drunk on.

764
00:40:31,154 --> 00:40:34,057
It's the friends
you get drunk with.

765
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:35,224
- Hey!
- Err!

766
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,026
- Hear, hear!
- Cheers.

767
00:40:38,427 --> 00:40:40,129
I can't believe you guys
have all stayed friends

768
00:40:40,129 --> 00:40:41,897
for so long. I mean,
I went to Boy Scout Camp.

769
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,199
I can't remember
a single name.

770
00:40:43,199 --> 00:40:44,900
Then again,
no one at Camp Nayaki

771
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,535
exactly stood out.

772
00:40:46,535 --> 00:40:47,403
Except

773
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,572
maybe this one kid----

774
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,640
who could burp for
ten straight minutes

775
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,541
without barfing.

776
00:40:52,541 --> 00:40:55,278
Ten straight minutes?

777
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:56,912
And you forgot his name?

778
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:59,115
How the great
are soon forgotten.

779
00:40:59,115 --> 00:41:00,749
Chris Gunther.
That was his name.

780
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,585
Like that guy
you're always
bugging me to read:

781
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:03,452
"Gunther" Grass.

782
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:05,388
Oh, forget about it,
Dennis,

783
00:41:05,388 --> 00:41:07,723
unless you're Jonesing
for a 600-page book
about a German child

784
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:10,259
with an unhealthy
attachment to a toy drum

785
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,095
and a voice that
can shatter glass.

786
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,462
Wow. Ha ha.

787
00:41:13,462 --> 00:41:15,664
I guess I'll miss it.

788
00:41:15,664 --> 00:41:18,767
Unless Ethan makes it
into an animated movie.

789
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,104
So, Dennis, Jules says

790
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,539
you are an ultrasound
technician.

791
00:41:23,539 --> 00:41:24,640
Yes, I am.

792
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,808
That sounds pretty cool.

793
00:41:25,808 --> 00:41:26,975
How'd you get into that?

794
00:41:26,975 --> 00:41:28,511
I just sort of fell
into it, actually.

795
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:29,612
After college,

796
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:31,314
I didn't really know
what I wanted to do.

797
00:41:31,314 --> 00:41:32,948
I saw this ad
on the subway

798
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,483
about becoming
a lab technician.

799
00:41:34,483 --> 00:41:36,119
Seemed like something
I could be good at.

800
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,620
- Huh.
- You make it sound

801
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,322
like you just flipped
a coin, Dennis.

802
00:41:39,322 --> 00:41:42,125
You must have given it
a little more thought
than that.

803
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:43,626
Not really.

804
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,760
Do you like it?

805
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,395
I do, actually.
Yes.

806
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:47,930
The other techies
are great.

807
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,232
We got our own
basketball team.

808
00:41:49,232 --> 00:41:50,366
The doctors are cool.

809
00:41:50,366 --> 00:41:51,734
Also,
it's in Chinatown.

810
00:41:51,734 --> 00:41:53,402
It's surrounded by all
these amazing vendors.

811
00:41:53,402 --> 00:41:54,737
I like to cook,
so sometimes

812
00:41:54,737 --> 00:41:57,005
on my way home
I pick up these really...

813
00:41:57,005 --> 00:41:59,208
bizarre ingredients
like...

814
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:02,178
star anise or, like,
these twisted roots

815
00:42:02,178 --> 00:42:03,346
that look like
wizard's hands.

816
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:05,348
- Yeah.
- How's your job, Jonah?

817
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:06,715
When are you going
to give that all up

818
00:42:06,715 --> 00:42:08,417
and go back
in the family business?

819
00:42:08,417 --> 00:42:10,153
His mother's Corinna Dey.

820
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,221
Oh. Right.
Jules was telling me

821
00:42:12,221 --> 00:42:13,622
about what an amazing
musician you are.

822
00:42:13,622 --> 00:42:15,191
I would love to hear you
play some time.

823
00:42:15,191 --> 00:42:17,560
Yeah. Well, I guess
she forgot to mention

824
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:19,061
that was in a former life.

825
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:20,596
Yeah, actually, I design

826
00:42:20,596 --> 00:42:22,431
tech innovations
for the disabled.

827
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:24,600
I just can't understand

828
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,003
how you could walk away
from so much talent.

829
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,973
Your music was
such a part of you.

830
00:42:30,973 --> 00:42:33,176
A part.

831
00:42:33,176 --> 00:42:35,544
Not the only part.

832
00:42:35,544 --> 00:42:38,547
You could have been
a huge star.

833
00:42:38,547 --> 00:42:41,217
Really, you should have
heard him.

834
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:43,186
There's more to life
than being famous.

835
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,220
At least I hope so,

836
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,021
or the rest of us
are screwed.

837
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,823
Besides, I don't think

838
00:42:47,823 --> 00:42:51,327
recognition has that much
to do with happiness.

839
00:42:51,327 --> 00:42:52,628
Like we say
at the clinic,

840
00:42:52,628 --> 00:42:53,929
it's what's inside
that counts.

841
00:42:53,929 --> 00:42:56,765
Words of wisdom from
the ultrasound technician.

842
00:43:00,936 --> 00:43:03,806
Excuse me. I have
to use the restroom.

843
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,479
That was funnier
in my head.

844
00:43:11,914 --> 00:43:13,249
He's great, Jules.

845
00:43:13,249 --> 00:43:16,852
You're an asshole,
but he is great.

846
00:43:36,038 --> 00:43:37,306
Fuck!

847
00:43:55,458 --> 00:43:57,893
Some fancy
moves.

848
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:58,894
Thank you.

849
00:44:18,581 --> 00:44:20,983
You didn't return
any of my phone calls.

850
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:29,325
My friends really liked you.

851
00:44:30,326 --> 00:44:31,760
At this point,
it's safe to say

852
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:33,962
they like you a lot more
than they do me.

853
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,305
I'm so sorry, Dennis.

854
00:44:42,305 --> 00:44:44,873
I was awful to you at dinner.

855
00:44:44,873 --> 00:44:47,075
I don't even know
what came over me.

856
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:48,444
- I just--
- I do.

857
00:44:48,444 --> 00:44:50,546
I'm not the right guy
for you, Jules.

858
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,751
You want this...

859
00:44:58,687 --> 00:44:59,888
big life.

860
00:45:01,023 --> 00:45:02,157
And you deserve it,

861
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,492
and you deserve
the right guy

862
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,793
to go along with it.

863
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,696
And that guy just isn't me.

864
00:45:07,696 --> 00:45:10,333
- Dennis--
- Let me finish, Jules.

865
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,335
I'm regular.

866
00:45:12,335 --> 00:45:14,036
You know?

867
00:45:14,036 --> 00:45:15,971
And you're...

868
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,708
Irregular?

869
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:22,044
Special.

870
00:45:23,346 --> 00:45:24,947
Big dreams.

871
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,484
I'm just an ordinary guy,
Jules.

872
00:45:28,484 --> 00:45:30,619
I'm never going to read
Günter Grass.

873
00:45:31,887 --> 00:45:32,921
I looked it up.

874
00:45:34,723 --> 00:45:37,092
I can't offer you this
extraordinary life,

875
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:38,894
just a real one.

876
00:45:38,894 --> 00:45:40,763
But...I don't know

877
00:45:40,763 --> 00:45:42,365
if that's going to be
enough for you.

878
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:43,766
I don't think
that life with me

879
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:45,534
is the life that you want.

880
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,603
I don't think
you should settle.

881
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:55,010
You know what I really
want, Dennis?

882
00:45:57,112 --> 00:45:58,847
I want to be like you.

883
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:02,017
I do.

884
00:46:02,017 --> 00:46:04,753
I want to be able to walk
into a room full of strangers

885
00:46:04,753 --> 00:46:06,589
and just be okay with myself,

886
00:46:06,589 --> 00:46:09,792
to feel like who I am
is good enough.

887
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:14,296
The thing is the only time
I've ever felt like that

888
00:46:14,296 --> 00:46:15,731
is when I'm with you.

889
00:46:19,702 --> 00:46:23,572
So to me, real is looking
pretty extraordinary right now.

890
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:32,648
Here.

891
00:46:35,117 --> 00:46:37,085
It's the "Hoya Destroya."

892
00:46:40,022 --> 00:46:42,057
I feel like anyone
who leads Georgetown

893
00:46:42,057 --> 00:46:43,526
to three final fours

894
00:46:43,526 --> 00:46:45,093
deserves to be
immortalized in plastic.

895
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,732
You're not the only one
with an encyclopedia.

896
00:47:17,059 --> 00:47:20,262
You look like a famous
actress, Mommy.

897
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:21,797
Oh.

898
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,868
Well, thank God I'm not

899
00:47:25,868 --> 00:47:28,471
because they're all
miserable and unhappy.

900
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:31,039
Money does not
buy you happiness.

901
00:47:31,039 --> 00:47:32,140
Remember that.

902
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:36,512
All right, go wash up
for supper, huh?

903
00:47:46,388 --> 00:47:47,590
Wow.

904
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:50,192
You look amazing.

905
00:47:50,192 --> 00:47:51,760
That's quite some dress.

906
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,695
Thanks.

907
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:54,897
I got it
at Alice's Underground.

908
00:47:54,897 --> 00:47:57,500
It was practically
brand-new.

909
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,267
I figured if I was going
to go to this thing,

910
00:47:59,267 --> 00:48:00,836
I might as well
get in the spirit.

911
00:48:02,204 --> 00:48:04,039
Ash owes me big time.

912
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:05,741
This is--

913
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:07,309
I can't believe she still
hasn't told Ethan

914
00:48:07,309 --> 00:48:08,611
about her brother.

915
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,982
That they've lived with this
gigantic lie between them

916
00:48:13,982 --> 00:48:15,518
all this time.

917
00:48:15,518 --> 00:48:18,186
It's shocking.

918
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,688
We may have our problems,

919
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:21,957
but at least what we have
isn't built on lies.

920
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:26,061
I'm going to get better,
Jules.

921
00:48:26,061 --> 00:48:27,229
I know.

922
00:48:28,531 --> 00:48:30,566
You'll figure it out.

923
00:48:30,566 --> 00:48:32,334
Prozac isn't for everyone.

924
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:34,537
I don't want to lose you.

925
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:42,410
Hello.

926
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:43,846
Your date has arrived.

927
00:48:43,846 --> 00:48:44,980
I'll be right down.

928
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,653
A limo. Wow.

929
00:48:50,653 --> 00:48:51,854
Beats the subway.

930
00:48:51,854 --> 00:48:53,989
Oh, they're perks he's given.

931
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:56,759
I don't think he really
cares about them that much.

932
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:58,994
- Um...
- Have fun.

933
00:49:00,295 --> 00:49:02,598
Of course I know how much
you'd rather stay home

934
00:49:02,598 --> 00:49:04,767
and play "Legend
of the Sword and the Fairy."

935
00:49:06,268 --> 00:49:07,570
I would, actually.

936
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,304
I'm not really
looking that forward

937
00:49:09,304 --> 00:49:11,574
to a bunch of bloated,
self-important people

938
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:12,675
congratulating
themselves

939
00:49:12,675 --> 00:49:14,577
on how rich and
successful they are.

940
00:49:14,577 --> 00:49:16,178
You could have said no.

941
00:49:19,648 --> 00:49:22,284
I should go. He's waiting.

942
00:49:22,284 --> 00:49:23,752
I love you.

943
00:49:26,488 --> 00:49:27,956
I love you, too.

944
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:30,092
I'll tell you all about it
in the morning.

945
00:49:31,159 --> 00:49:32,260
Mm. Sorry.

946
00:49:49,912 --> 00:49:52,147
Your chariot awaits,
my lady.

947
00:49:54,750 --> 00:49:56,251
Wow. I mean, look at you.

948
00:49:56,251 --> 00:49:57,920
You look like
a fairy princess.

949
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,888
**

950
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:21,644
Yes.

951
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:36,892
Oh, my God. Ethan,
this is amazing.

952
00:50:36,892 --> 00:50:38,360
This could be
in a movie theater

953
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,561
or on TV right now.

954
00:50:39,561 --> 00:50:41,263
Seriously, Ethan,
it's brilliant.

955
00:50:41,263 --> 00:50:45,300
It's just so smart
and original, you know?

956
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:46,401
Thanks.

957
00:50:46,401 --> 00:50:48,003
See, I knew--

958
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,938
I knew you'd get it,
that we--

959
00:50:49,938 --> 00:50:52,675
that we shared
a certain sensibility

960
00:50:52,675 --> 00:50:53,976
and that you might like it.

961
00:50:53,976 --> 00:50:55,343
I love it.

962
00:50:59,114 --> 00:51:00,448
Wow.

963
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:02,584
What do you know?

964
00:51:02,584 --> 00:51:05,220
Jules Jacobson loves it.

965
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:31,246
Mm-mm. Uh, what--
what are you doing?

966
00:51:33,581 --> 00:51:34,850
I'm s-- I'm sorry. I--

967
00:51:34,850 --> 00:51:36,051
- I-- I just--
- No. It was my fault.

968
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,720
- Wow.
- Forget it, really.

969
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,721
- I-- I--
- It's fine.

970
00:51:38,721 --> 00:51:39,855
I feel terrible.

971
00:51:39,855 --> 00:51:41,757
No, no, no, no.
You've nothing

972
00:51:41,757 --> 00:51:43,726
to feel terrible
about, Jules.

973
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,261
It's not a big deal.

974
00:51:52,735 --> 00:51:55,270
Look, look, seriously,

975
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:58,240
I don't want this
to come between us.

976
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,844
People have been
rejected by other people

977
00:52:01,844 --> 00:52:03,812
since the dawn of time.

978
00:52:04,813 --> 00:52:06,048
W-W-We're--

979
00:52:06,048 --> 00:52:09,251
We're just riding
the wave of history.

980
00:52:11,386 --> 00:52:14,823
I've never rejected anyone
before in my life,

981
00:52:14,823 --> 00:52:18,827
although I've never accepted
anyone before, either.

982
00:52:18,827 --> 00:52:21,764
What I mean
is it's never come up.

983
00:52:31,039 --> 00:52:33,175
Well, maybe the reason

984
00:52:33,175 --> 00:52:35,778
that you don't want
to do this with me

985
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,813
isn't even because of me.

986
00:52:37,813 --> 00:52:39,047
What do you mean?

987
00:52:39,047 --> 00:52:42,785
Well, you say that you
haven't accepted

988
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:46,054
or rejected anyone
before, right?

989
00:52:46,054 --> 00:52:50,793
So you are 100%
inexperienced.

990
00:52:50,793 --> 00:52:53,195
Maybe
you're just nervous.

991
00:52:53,195 --> 00:52:56,364
Your nervousness
could be masking
your real feelings.

992
00:52:56,364 --> 00:52:58,166
Uh, maybe.

993
00:52:58,166 --> 00:53:00,803
It happens to girls
sometimes.

994
00:53:03,071 --> 00:53:05,808
I-- I have
a proposition for you.

995
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:09,711
Just reconsider.

996
00:53:09,711 --> 00:53:11,013
Spend some more time
with me

997
00:53:11,013 --> 00:53:12,480
and see what happens.

998
00:53:14,382 --> 00:53:15,818
All right.

999
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:18,386
Sure. Why not?

1000
00:53:18,386 --> 00:53:19,487
Excellent.

1001
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:22,424
To be continued.

1002
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:34,870
You look sensational,

1003
00:53:34,870 --> 00:53:36,171
Jules, really.

1004
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,240
It's hard not to
in Valentino.

1005
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,176
I can't even imagine
what this thing costs.

1006
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:43,445
Oh, come on.
Ash was adamant,

1007
00:53:43,445 --> 00:53:46,448
and she picked it out
before she left for Bali.

1008
00:53:47,850 --> 00:53:51,219
Well, it's very sweet,
both of you.

1009
00:53:51,219 --> 00:53:53,856
Here.
Come on. Tradition.

1010
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,423
Tradition.

1011
00:53:55,423 --> 00:53:57,292
For special nights.

1012
00:53:57,292 --> 00:53:58,961
You've won
about a million awards.

1013
00:53:58,961 --> 00:54:00,896
What's special
about this one?

1014
00:54:00,896 --> 00:54:03,665
Because tonight
I'm spending it

1015
00:54:03,665 --> 00:54:05,733
with my oldest,
dearest friend.

1016
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:10,338
No kids, no spouses.

1017
00:54:10,338 --> 00:54:12,574
Just the two of us,
like old times.

1018
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:18,346
To us.

1019
00:54:19,581 --> 00:54:20,949
Two old friends

1020
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,317
sharing our lives
together.

1021
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:27,289
Jules.

1022
00:54:29,591 --> 00:54:31,193
Hey.

1023
00:54:33,461 --> 00:54:34,897
Jules.

1024
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,502
I don't think Dennis and I
are going to make it.

1025
00:55:01,789 --> 00:55:04,592
This is a final boarding
call for Flight--

1026
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:09,131
Mom and Dad must have
paid a fortune for this.

1027
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:10,933
Will you
keep your voice down?

1028
00:55:10,933 --> 00:55:12,467
It's really good.

1029
00:55:12,467 --> 00:55:14,269
How did they even
know where to go?

1030
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,938
Dad invested something
for someone once.

1031
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:18,240
I don't know.
He was owed a favor.

1032
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:21,509
"Raymond Price."
I like the name.

1033
00:55:21,509 --> 00:55:23,111
It suits me, kind of.

1034
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:25,480
Can we not talk
about this right now?

1035
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:26,548
Hey, chill out, Ash.

1036
00:55:26,548 --> 00:55:28,116
You're acting like
a fucking criminal.

1037
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,517
I am a fucking criminal.

1038
00:55:29,517 --> 00:55:31,253
You're not the only one
who'll go to jail

1039
00:55:31,253 --> 00:55:33,688
if we're caught. You realize
that, right, Goodman?

1040
00:55:33,688 --> 00:55:36,524
I'm touched, Ash, really.

1041
00:55:36,524 --> 00:55:38,626
It's fucking noble of you.

1042
00:55:41,096 --> 00:55:43,031
And it's Raymond.

1043
00:55:44,699 --> 00:55:46,201
I'm doing this for Mom.

1044
00:55:46,201 --> 00:55:47,970
You're all she talks about,

1045
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,173
couldn't bear the idea
that she wouldn't see you
before she left.

1046
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:56,611
How long did they say?

1047
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,286
How about Jacobson?

1048
00:56:04,286 --> 00:56:06,554
She know about me being back?

1049
00:56:06,554 --> 00:56:09,724
No. She doesn't.
Neither does Ethan.

1050
00:56:09,724 --> 00:56:12,094
And you're not going
to be here long enough

1051
00:56:12,094 --> 00:56:14,229
for either of them
to find out.

1052
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:15,897
Wow.

1053
00:56:15,897 --> 00:56:18,733
You still haven't
told him about me?

1054
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:20,635
That is fucking
impressive, Ash.

1055
00:56:20,635 --> 00:56:21,636
Next.

1056
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,154
Next.

1057
00:56:53,401 --> 00:56:55,803
Business or pleasure,
Mr. Price?

1058
00:56:55,803 --> 00:56:56,871
Sorry, what?

1059
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,273
Your trip.

1060
00:56:58,273 --> 00:57:00,508
Was it business
or pleasure?

1061
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:06,314
Uh, pleasure. Yeah.

1062
00:57:06,314 --> 00:57:09,051
Always
wanted to see Iceland.

1063
00:57:18,660 --> 00:57:20,795
Welcome home, Mr. Price.

1064
00:57:20,795 --> 00:57:22,464
Next.

1065
00:57:48,656 --> 00:57:50,092
Hmm.

1066
00:59:59,086 --> 01:00:00,788
Just not funny, Richard.
