1
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,930
Why is this thing so heavy?

2
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,660
Oh, cool!

3
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,550
How do I look?

4
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,070
Was that hat in the trunk
you just brought up?

5
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:50,630
What else is in there?

6
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,500
These are.

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,600
Oh...

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,960
We may have brought up
the wrong trunk.

9
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,040
Oh, yeah.

10
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,740
Your mother wouldn't want
this up here.

11
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,910
This is her...

12
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,710
Her treasure chest.

13
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,840
Can you play this?

14
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,050
No, I can't play 'em.

15
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,070
Your mother can, though.

16
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,970
She loves
the bagpipes.

17
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,240
I didn't think girls could
play the bagpipes.

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,090
Your mother's not a girl.

19
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,680
That is, your mother's
never really been a girl

20
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,640
the way that
other girls...

21
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,810
Are girls.

22
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,850
Dad, I'd just leave that alone
If I were you.

23
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:40,410
I wonder if it still works.

24
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,880
What's this?

25
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:55,160
It's a story...

26
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,950
about your mom.

27
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,450
Come on. I have an idea.

28
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,810
Tell mom to tell you
the story

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,800
just like she told it to me.Okay.

30
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:32,450
Well, my, my, my, my...

31
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:36,300
Hi.
Hi. How are you, so?

32
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,630
And what brings you out
to the fields today, Lassie?

33
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,110
I got something for ya.

34
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,350
Dad says there's a story in there.

35
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,650
Oh, yes.

36
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm afraid I don't see it.

37
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,680
Well, that's because
there's a lot missing.

38
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,220
You can see this is our farm,
though, right?

39
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:04,420
Yeah, and these mountains
are those over there.

40
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,370
Right.
And this is the old cemetery.

41
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,310
And Ira is you, right?

42
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,070
You don't like the name Iris,
do you?

43
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:15,410
Nope.

44
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,440
Well, how old were you
In that picture?

45
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,320
I was 11 years old.

46
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,050
I only had one more year left
of freedom.

47
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,830
What do you mean?

48
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,230
I mean that the next year

49
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,810
I had to go out on the farm

50
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,890
and work everyday
like my older sisters.

51
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,800
What happened in this picture?

52
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,280
Who's Oscar?

53
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,280
We have to go back
quite a'ways

54
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,040
before we get to what
happened in this picture.

55
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,660
The enemy has advanced
far enough.

56
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,450
Fire the cannons.

57
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,990
Ira!

58
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,180
We are waiting, Oscar.

59
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,770
Sorry.

60
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,570
We're not leaving
grandmother, Oscar.

61
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,440
She will be with us.

62
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,730
She's with us now.

63
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,120
If grandmother had been treated
the way people should be treated...

64
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:17,360
when we work in the fields all our
life, she would still be alive today.

65
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,490
- Please, don't say that.
- But it's true and it's how I feel.

66
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,180
- Then, please don't say it around Oscar.
- Momma...

67
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:26,260
The foreman said that the place
where we will be working this summer,

68
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,050
It will be different.

69
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,150
But that doesn't bring our
grandmother back, does it?

70
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,050
But it can be good for us.

71
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:34,340
And that will be good for Oscar.

72
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,890
That is what I want now.

73
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,720
Please, Marcus, help me to make
It good for him.

74
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,470
Go out and tell the girls
to come in for dinner.

75
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:31,200
Okay.

76
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,120
No funny business, okay?

77
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,060
Please. Just deliver the message.

78
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,840
If we have do the same thing again
for our vacation next year

79
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,080
As we do every year.

80
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
I'll just soon stay out here
and hoe beets.

81
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,840
Look how sick that I am!

82
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm not sick of it.

83
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,080
What, you're not sick
of hoeing beets,

84
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,680
or you're not sick of
the same vacation?

85
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:03,270
- I'm not sick of the same vacation.
- I know.

86
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:06,030
You like cotton candy.

87
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,990
Little pigs. And birds.

88
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,030
And little bunny rabbits.

89
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,140
And popcorn! And so does Ira.

90
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,990
That's why we have to go do the same
old stupid thing we do every year.

91
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:22,000
You just want to go see
the Beach Boys.

92
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:23,430
Don't you?
Yeah.

93
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,400
Well, then get on the train.

94
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,560
If we're gonna talk mom and
dad into doing this,

95
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:29,940
then we've all got to be
on board, including Ira.

96
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:31,570
Well, that will never happen.

97
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,770
She hates the beach boys.
She hates everything.

98
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:37,810
Except her army men and baseball.

99
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,800
She should have been born a boy.

100
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,420
She is a boy.

101
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,570
She doesn't do one thing or like
one single thing that girls like.

102
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,170
She doesn't even like her name.

103
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:48,420
Would you like your name if
is its Iris?

104
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,940
No.

105
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,070
But I wouldn't give myself
a man's name.

106
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,510
It's not normal. Who's not skin
off your nose how she acts.

107
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,410
Wrong, I can't go anywhere,
do anything with my friends...

108
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,090
without somebody asking me,

109
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:01,950
"why is Ira like that?"

110
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,400
She makes our whole family
look strange.

111
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,770
No!

112
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,410
Ira, no!

113
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,490
Dinner's ready!

114
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,090
Ira!

115
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,480
Get back here, Ira!

116
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,270
I'm gonna kill you!

117
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:43,090
You will die!

118
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,220
Hey, dad, I heard about
this machine...

119
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:53,110
It goes along the fields,
cuts out all the weeds

120
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,710
And takes care of the beets...

121
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,960
I never heard of anything
like that.

122
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:58,670
They might be working on
something like that.

123
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:00,110
What's it called?

124
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,060
It's like a corilla...

125
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,560
rilla...

126
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,870
No, no, you mean a corrugator.

127
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,820
See, that goes along and cuts
the furrows

128
00:11:08,930 --> 00:11:11,080
and then we run the water
down to irrigate.

129
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,900
No, that's not what I'm
talking about.

130
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,970
I can't remember.

131
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,330
Well, I got the exact acreage...

132
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,260
on the crop for this year.
From who?

133
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,950
Jack, the surveyor.

134
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,610
How much?No.

135
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,370
Don't say it. I don't want
to know.

136
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,260
It's a lot more than last year.
Let's just leave It at that.

137
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,250
If we know it just makes
it worse

138
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,790
You wannna to go to
college next year, right?

139
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:39,540
This is part of the price we
have to pay to make that happen.

140
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,810
Besides, you don't have to hoe
the whole crop by yourself.

141
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:44,320
What do you mean?
I mean you're gonna have help.

142
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,520
From who?
From the little crop-hoeing
fairies, of course.

143
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,630
You are such a
dip, Iris.

144
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:50,970
Thank you.

145
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,740
No names, please.

146
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,510
It's not a name.
It's what she is.

147
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,370
Do you want to hear the rest
of this or not?

148
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,570
Sorry.

149
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,370
I went out to the labor camp,
maybe with the foreman,

150
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,620
and gonna hire a couple of
mexican families to move in...

151
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,530
and help us with the crop.

152
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:08,600
That's what I was afraid you're
gonna say.

153
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,090
Why?

154
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,100
Because dad, you know all
that stuff that goes on

155
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,690
when the mexicans
come in to work.

156
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,060
It's a mess.

157
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,030
Yes, but whose fault is that
most of the time, Jane?

158
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,570
That's not the point, mom.

159
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,420
Then what is the point?
Ira...

160
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,850
When the mexican workers
come in Summer

161
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,300
It means trouble.

162
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,060
It doesn't matter
who starts it.

163
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,610
I'm sure it matters to them.

164
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:31,180
I didn't mean like that.

165
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,780
What I mean is when the fights
break out,

166
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,110
What ends happening it's
always the same.

167
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,560
Well, still the weeds are not
going to hoe themselves,

168
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,330
and we can't do it all.

169
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,140
Maybe we could hire some other
people to come the work.

170
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:45,860
Like who? Your friends?
Sure.

171
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,920
Right, Afton.
They'd come.

172
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,030
Terry and chris?

173
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,820
And Nancy?

174
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,740
There's a picture for ya.

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,830
I don't think you're being fair.

176
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:04,990
Well, maybe not, but it's Ok
just this once,

177
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,750
I'd like to hire somebody who
knows which end of the hoe to hold.

178
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,940
When will the workers
be here?

179
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,820
They should be here
ready to work monday.

180
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,100
D-day.

181
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:18,050
D-day?

182
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,760
Invasion day, Aftonia.

183
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,900
Dad?

184
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,400
Can we go into town tomorrow?

185
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,940
A little saturday day off.

186
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,320
But, if you don't
work tomorrow,

187
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,760
It doesn't go away. It just
gets moved to later.

188
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,160
That's okay.
I believe in later.

189
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,120
Who were they, mama?

190
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,370
It doesn't matter.

191
00:14:43,810 --> 00:14:45,000
Where you going?

192
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,580
To the railroad tracks.

193
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,320
If you're not back here when
the girls...

194
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:50,240
leave for town no go without you.

195
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,890
Down and pick me up there.

196
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,390
I'll tell them, but that doesn't
mean they'll do it.

197
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,520
She's going for the record today,
ladies and gents.

198
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,220
The last time we saw
this young lady,

199
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,660
she tossed eight rocks
through the moving cars.

200
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,670
Today she's gonna do ten.

201
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,620
It seems impossible,
but she's vowed to do it.

202
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,390
The first throw goes
right through

203
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,160
and the crowd goes wild.

204
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,450
Two.

205
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,320
Three.

206
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:39,750
Four.

207
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,740
Five.

208
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,990
Six.

209
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,630
Seven.

210
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,660
Eight.

211
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,870
Nine.

212
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,370
The poofy-headed sisters
are closing in.

213
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,440
Only a few more seconds left
to break the record.

214
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:12,740
Can she do it?

215
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,220
Come on, let's go!

216
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,890
She does it!

217
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,660
Drop the bike!

218
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,470
We'll pick it up later!

219
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:39,380
She breaks the record with one
last throw.

220
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,150
This kid is incredible.

221
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,660
What a kid!

222
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,910
What a future!

223
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:45,340
What a dip!

224
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,470
Where you two been?

225
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,500
Just down there.

226
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,370
Seen Afton?

227
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,680
Yeah, I saw her.

228
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,910
She was talking with
Tav Jobarth.

229
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,440
I've got to have a talk
with that girl

230
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:12,040
about her taste in men.

231
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:13,820
Teddy Allen was there, too.

232
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,430
See what I mean.

233
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,140
Tav and Teddy, ugh!

234
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,170
So, Jane, how ya doing?

235
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,470
Fine, fine.

236
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,660
Did you get a free bowl of soup

237
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,200
with that haircut, Randy?

238
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:45,240
You're not being
too friendly today, Jane.

239
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,440
I'm being friendly.

240
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,070
I like Randy's hair.

241
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,890
You don't think I'm being
too unfriendly,

242
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,710
do you, Randy?
I don't know.

243
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,000
Why don't you jump in with us?

244
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:02,250
I'd love to, but I'm in
charge today.

245
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,860
They'll be okay.

246
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,050
Come on, two minutes.
Maybe some other time.

247
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,820
You mean it?
Sure.

248
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,200
Maybe sometime when
Blake's driving, maybe...

249
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,370
Why does he gotta be driving?

250
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:17,040
He doesn't even have a car.

251
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,720
I don't know.

252
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,360
Well, would ya look at that.

253
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,690
Summer's here.

254
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:36,710
Hey, Jane, you know what we call
those trucks?

255
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,960
Mexican airliners.

256
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:51,870
They've had a long, hard trip.

257
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,880
Come on, they don't need us to
stand here and stare at them.

258
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,480
What happened? What is this?

259
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,400
What did they threw?

260
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,560
Marcus, where are you going?

261
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,600
You got something to say
to me, bug?

262
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:37,580
Did you drop this?

263
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:40,730
Did you drop this?

264
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,600
That's a nice beaner boy.

265
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,610
You know what?

266
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,320
You can have it.

267
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,330
Morons.

268
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,150
I don't figure Blake
in with those two.

269
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:04,860
What?
Nothing.

270
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:33,940
What happened to Ira?

271
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,550
I had her go out to the pasture

272
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,130
to pick up all those
army men.

273
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:39,150
There must be a million of them
out there.

274
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,870
What are we gonna do with her?

275
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,110
In six months, she's going to be
12 years old.

276
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,970
I wouldn't worry about
it too much.

277
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,180
I wasn't so different
when I was her age.

278
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,490
You know, the funniest
part is, she'll probably...

279
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:51,610
turn out to be the prettiest
of all the girls.

280
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:55,630
Anyway, she should be back.

281
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,090
Well, I'll go find her.

282
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,600
I thought she might like
to ride

283
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,110
to the labor camp with me.

284
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,560
1,

285
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,500
2,

286
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,410
3,

287
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,150
4,

288
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:41,840
5,

289
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,780
6,

290
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:43,620
7,

291
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,760
8,

292
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:45,570
9,

293
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,460
10,

294
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,380
11,

295
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,340
12,

296
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,350
13, 14, 15, 16,

297
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,760
17, 18, 19, 20,

298
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,140
21!

299
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,270
21!

300
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,750
A new record!

301
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,140
Dad...
Yeah?

302
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,180
What do they do in Scotland

303
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,710
when somebody dies?

304
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,120
Where did that question
come from?

305
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,490
You been losing a lot of men
in battle lately?

306
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,150
No.

307
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:29,250
Do you know how the people in
the old cemetery died?

308
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,150
No, I don't actually.

309
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,060
That's a good question.

310
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,260
I should know, I guess.

311
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:42,160
I wonder if anybody did
anything for them when they died?

312
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,840
Somebody buried 'em.

313
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:51,310
Where are all these questions
coming from?

314
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,160
I thought that old cemetery
was scary to ya.

315
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,520
It is.

316
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,890
I'll be right over here, Ira.
I'm gonna talk to the foreman.

317
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,540
Do you want play?

318
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,230
Play?

319
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:14,940
Yes, you play?

320
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:37,050
So you couldn't sleep because
Oscar was coming?

321
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,070
No.

322
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:42,200
I didn't even know Oscar's
family would work for us.

323
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,460
I didn't even
know his name, yet.

324
00:25:44,570 --> 00:25:46,130
You didn't?
Nope.

325
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,180
How come you couldn't
go to sleep?

326
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,120
Because I had just gone into
this whole different world.

327
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,770
And very soon,

328
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,900
that world was going to be
coming to my own front door.

329
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,010
I was so wound up,

330
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,880
I could have drilled myself
right Into the ground.

331
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,130
That next monday morning,

332
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,460
I was up before the sun.

333
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,390
Battle stations.

334
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,230
Invasion...

335
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,940
Dad?
Ira?

336
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,730
Ira, what are you doing?

337
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,560
Surveillance.

338
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,780
I was spotted, though. Dang it!

339
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,600
Spotted?

340
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,480
You ruined my cover...

341
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,190
at the last second.

342
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,840
What's all this sneaking
around about?

343
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:08,790
You've gotta know where
the enemy's gonna be first.

344
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:11,350
Then you know what to do with
the enemy later.

345
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,040
I see.

346
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,700
You have an amazing
Imagination, Ira.

347
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:23,140
I wouldn't change that
for the world. That's a gift.

348
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:27,080
And I know you're excited to
have these people...

349
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,720
come up to our farm.

350
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,350
And I'm glad you're excited.

351
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,120
They are amazing.

352
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,020
There's no question
they're different from us.

353
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,810
They're mexicans.

354
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,170
They're people.

355
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:44,910
They're people, Ira. They're not
just big life-sized versions...

356
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,440
of your army men.

357
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,600
You see what I'm saying?

358
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,010
See, Ira, sometimes in the
world...

359
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,830
when a group of people
who are pretty much alike

360
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,530
suddenly come in contact with
a group of people

361
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:04,040
who are different, they...

362
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:07,800
They tend to stop thinking
of them as people.

363
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,070
Instead, they think of them
as things

364
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,860
Because it's easy, with
a little effort,

365
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:16,600
to understand a thing.

366
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,590
But it takes a lot of effort
to understand a person.

367
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,270
Especially one who's different.

368
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,840
Will you try to think
about that

369
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:28,970
while we have them here
with us?

370
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:36,220
How much do you pay 'em?

371
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:41,620
About twice what they'd get
anywhere else.

372
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,260
That's our little secret, okay?

373
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,720
Okay.

374
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,190
Would you go outside
and tell Ira to come in?

375
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,870
Sure, where is she?
Front porch, I think.

376
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:32,990
Ira, come and eat!

377
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,630
I'm not hungry...

378
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,670
Is that your name?

379
00:33:45,050 --> 00:33:46,300
Oscar.

380
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:48,060
My name.

381
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:51,060
Era?

382
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,230
I...

383
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,930
Ira.

384
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,950
I...

385
00:33:58,390 --> 00:33:59,760
Irrra.

386
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,770
I was watching the workers
out there today

387
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,640
from the field
we were working in...

388
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,540
They were zooming
up and down the rows.

389
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,460
They are pretty fast.

390
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,900
When you could tell
clear from the field

391
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,700
we were working in they got
a lot done.

392
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,870
Dad, you keep saying,
"uh-huh, uh-huh,"like

393
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,910
- You think I'm leading up to something.
- Are you?

394
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:26,400
No.

395
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,890
But, I was just...

396
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,540
Dad!
What?

397
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,370
I'm sorry, you're not leading
up to something

398
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,280
even though it sounds like
you are.

399
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:36,480
Goa ahead.

400
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,390
I was gonna say is...

401
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,240
is that if they can get that
much done in one day, then...

402
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,390
maybe we could go just a little
bit further away on you vacation.

403
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,130
And gonna see the Beach Boys.

404
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,390
Rene!

405
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:50,240
I didn't say anything.
That's true, she didn't.

406
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:56,020
Hello, Ira.

407
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,390
Hi.

408
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,450
This is my friend, Oscar.

409
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,710
Nice to meet you, Oscar.

410
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,930
I invited him over for dinner.

411
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:12,560
His mom said it was okay,
didn't she, Oscar?

412
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,180
Okay?Eat?

413
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,210
Yes.

414
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,780
Well, why don't you
get another plate

415
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,190
and maybe we could just scoot
everybody up this way.

416
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:27,430
Rene, yes, thanks.

417
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:28,930
Scoot toward me.

418
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,260
Thank you.

419
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,080
All right.

420
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:44,140
He's a person,just like we are.

421
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,770
So everybody just
act normal, okay.

422
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:50,030
Right, dad?

423
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,530
That's right.

424
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,980
Dad!

425
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:31,350
What are you doing?

426
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,150
You're gonna die in those beds.

427
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:35,680
Up and on your feet, lasses.

428
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:38,130
You're moving into the field
with the other workers today.

429
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,570
So hurry up!

430
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:01,100
That's the way to 'rouse the
poofy heads, dad.

431
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,450
Wish I'd thought of it myself.

432
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,640
Now, I know how
Marilyn Monroe feels.

433
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,440
Where you goin'?

434
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,200
What are you doin'?

435
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:40,450
You family?

436
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:41,910
Huh-uh.

437
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,420
We don't know 'em.

438
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,420
They died a long time ago.

439
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,990
You no know who buried?

440
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,720
It was here when we started
the farm.

441
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,170
I like it.

442
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,530
You do?
Yes.

443
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,530
You don't?

444
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,550
Huh-uh.

445
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:05,080
Why?

446
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,790
Because...

447
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,600
It's spooky.

448
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,130
Spoky?

449
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:14,310
No, spoo-ky.

450
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,300
You know, oooo, like ghosts.

451
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,420
Oooo, you scared, then.

452
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:23,360
Come on, let's get out of here.

453
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:27,130
From that day on,

454
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,360
the cemetery became our
meeting place.

455
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:31,090
Every morning we'd meet up
there

456
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:32,810
and launch out
on our adventures.

457
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,280
And what did you go do?

458
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:35,970
Oh, about everything
you could think of.

459
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:38,350
Like what?
Like everything.

460
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:12,220
Gotcha!

461
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:56,480
La vida es como un rio.

462
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:00,680
La vida es como un rio.

463
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,580
Rio.

464
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,980
Un rio.

465
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,960
Good.

466
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:09,870
So, what does it mean?

467
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:11,780
Life is like a river.

468
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,690
Life is like a river.

469
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,410
Okay, I got one.

470
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,740
How do you say "poofy-headed
sisters" in spanish?

471
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:27,510
Poofy head?

472
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,360
Yeah.

473
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:30,940
What mean it?

474
00:43:31,170 --> 00:43:32,810
It means...

475
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:35,350
girls who act too much
like girls.

476
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,330
I think I no tell you.

477
00:43:38,670 --> 00:43:40,210
Why?

478
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,960
To be better to your sisters.

479
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:45,580
You be better... nicer.

480
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,710
Yeah, well, you can say that

481
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:49,380
'cuz you don't have any
sisters.

482
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,250
So you don't know
how they are.

483
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,160
They don't deserve
better, nicer.

484
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:58,540
Sometimes getting all primped
up, I just wanna smack 'em.

485
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,530
But they you famly.

486
00:44:00,690 --> 00:44:02,660
You no ever want hit famlly,

487
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,430
not any person, anytime
or anywhere.

488
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,140
Hit no help.

489
00:44:08,870 --> 00:44:11,660
You be better and nicer
to your sisters.

490
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:15,410
Then I teach you how
to say "poofy head."

491
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,470
Deal.

492
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,830
Well, I gotta get back to work.

493
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,330
Yeah, right.

494
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,150
But we're on, right?
Uh-huh.

495
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,330
So, I'll see you Saturday?

496
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:43,850
Yes.

497
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,540
Jane, you're not gonna
back out?

498
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:49,070
Oh, no.

499
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,830
Is that her little mexi-man?

500
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,050
Shut up.

501
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:16,280
Make it quick; we gotta
get back.

502
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:21,210
This one. This one is the
absolute best.

503
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:23,990
I could eat these until I die
and I wouldn't care.

504
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,940
You probably no have
to eat too many.

505
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,000
Is this one of the tacos that
work for your dad?

506
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,800
Get lost, okay.

507
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,500
Your face is turning red.

508
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,120
You know, if I were you,

509
00:45:54,210 --> 00:45:56,020
I would never bring
him out in pubiic.

510
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,270
You okay?

511
00:46:12,130 --> 00:46:13,720
Just ignore 'em.

512
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:17,230
Okay.

513
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,180
Hey, guys. Hang on a sec.

514
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,530
Hi.

515
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,940
Seems like every time I see
you're in the back seat of that car.

516
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:09,210
When you don't have wheels of
your own, what else can you do?

517
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,980
Got a point there,
I guess.

518
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,760
Can I ask you something?

519
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:19,320
Sure.

520
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:21,960
Why you cruisin' around
with Todd and Randy?

521
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:26,140
Why not? They're okay.

522
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,170
Maybe it's the only way
I can see the people

523
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,890
I really want to see.

524
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,220
Hey, how's your mexican
buddy doing?

525
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,360
You guys seemed pretty chummy
other day.

526
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:44,040
Anything wrong with that?

527
00:47:44,650 --> 00:47:46,200
You tell me.

528
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,220
You know what,

529
00:47:48,330 --> 00:47:50,370
I'm just
going to forget this part of
our conversation...

530
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,110
because I don't think
you really buy in to all that.

531
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,610
All what?

532
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,920
All that talk Todd and
Randy dish out

533
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,010
about anybody who isn't
as white as they are.

534
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,430
Maybe I do feel the same
way they do.

535
00:48:02,730 --> 00:48:04,230
Well.

536
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,050
Maybe.

537
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,780
But I hope not.

538
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,650
Are you coming tonight?

539
00:48:15,540 --> 00:48:17,110
Oh, yeah.

540
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:19,860
You don't seem too excited.

541
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:22,560
Who's your date?

542
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:24,430
Todd's old girlfriend.

543
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:27,940
Sorry.

544
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,510
It's okay.

545
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,100
I'll just pretend
It's somebody else.

546
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,720
Maybe next time
you could work it out

547
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,720
so you won't have to pretend.

548
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:43,510
Yeah,

549
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:45,480
maybe...

550
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:47,540
see you later.

551
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:51,720
Bye.

552
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,730
That was an interesting
conversation.

553
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,960
You heard all that?

554
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:05,880
Sure, I heard it.

555
00:49:08,790 --> 00:49:10,860
I didn't understand it,
though.
Good.

556
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:15,080
No, what I mean is, If Blake's
the one you like,

557
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,680
why are you going out with
T-T-Todd tonight?

558
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:19,680
I don't get it.

559
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,680
Well, the way I look at it is,

560
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,250
I go out with him tonight,

561
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:25,010
have a terrible time,

562
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:26,910
and then, maybe he'll leave
me alone.

563
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,370
And since we're going to
a dance

564
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:33,490
and we're all going together,
then, you know...

565
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:35,740
maybe I'll get to spend some
time with Blake.

566
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:39,450
See how complicated
being a girl is.

567
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,310
Remember the deal now.

568
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,880
No playing tricks on Jane When
she comes home from her date.

569
00:49:50,990 --> 00:49:52,260
Promise?

570
00:49:52,350 --> 00:49:53,960
I promise.

571
00:49:55,790 --> 00:49:57,570
Doesn't mean we can't spy
on 'em.

572
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:05,600
Hey, Oscar, can I ask you
something?

573
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,720
Okay.

574
00:50:08,050 --> 00:50:10,860
How come you always want
to meet down at the cemetery?

575
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,180
Because I like it.

576
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,770
Oh, yeah, I know.

577
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,980
But how come you don't ever
want to meet anywhere else?

578
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,900
Like at the lookout or
something?

579
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,700
It's not okay at cemetery?

580
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:28,960
No, it's okay.

581
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,430
It's just
not normal.

582
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,770
You know what I mean?

583
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:37,310
It's not normal to like to be
around dead people.

584
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:38,970
Why?

585
00:50:39,050 --> 00:50:41,460
Because they're spooky.

586
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:43,340
Why?

587
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:45,930
Because they're dead.

588
00:50:47,530 --> 00:50:50,270
My grandmother dead and
she no spoky.

589
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:52,250
Spoo-ky.

590
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,590
Spoo-ky.

591
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:56,700
She's not.

592
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:59,030
But your grandma isn't
in that cemetery.

593
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:02,620
But when I go there,

594
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,100
I feel like she is there.

595
00:51:07,470 --> 00:51:09,430
My grandma died last year.

596
00:51:10,990 --> 00:51:12,480
I'm sorry.

597
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,290
Where is your grandmother
buried?

598
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:20,260
In the cemetery in by town.

599
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,820
Do you think that cemetery
is spooky, too?

600
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,230
Yeah, I guess.

601
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,180
It's kinda creepy.

602
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:29,590
Creaky?

603
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:31,530
Cree-py.

604
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:34,650
You know, spoo-ky.

605
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,300
Do you like your grandmother?

606
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:42,600
Uh huh.

607
00:51:43,150 --> 00:51:44,680
I like my grandma a lot.

608
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:48,000
Did you go visit her?

609
00:51:48,770 --> 00:51:50,270
At the cemetery?

610
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:53,170
Well, no.

611
00:51:53,870 --> 00:51:55,420
You should.

612
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:58,120
It lets you feel quiet.

613
00:51:59,830 --> 00:52:01,250
Quiet?

614
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,690
Inside.

615
00:52:11,390 --> 00:52:12,910
You're not normal, too.

616
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,540
I'm not normal?
No, you're not.

617
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,950
What's not normal about me?

618
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:20,660
You live like boys do.

619
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,510
I like living like a boy.

620
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:26,300
I'm gonna have to be a girl
soon enough.

621
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:29,140
You don't even use girl's name.

622
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,920
Your real name is Iris.

623
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,040
Who told you that?

624
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,080
They're back early.

625
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,930
Come on, Jane!
Calm down, will ya?

626
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:03,530
I brought you home.
I should have walked.

627
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,730
You're not giving me a chance...
To what?

628
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:08,440
I don't know, to say something.
To say something?

629
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:12,190
What you need to do, Todd,  is keep
your mouth shut and not say so much.

630
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,760
I don't understand why you
get so mad about what I said.

631
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,890
Because I'm sick of hearing
it, that why.

632
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:20,050
I am sick of hearing about
what you want to do to anybody...

633
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,480
who isn't just like you are.

634
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,990
So?
So?!

635
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:26,670
As far as I concerned you're just
like all those people on TV...

636
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:30,070
all those people who throw bricks
and set fires and hurt people!

637
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,580
What are you talking about?

638
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:33,740
Nevermind!

639
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:37,180
I honestly don't think you're smart
enough to know what I am talking about.

640
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:41,490
What? You don't think I could
do the things I say I do?

641
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:44,780
No, that's not what I'm talking
about, but suit your brother...

642
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,170
But let me tell you what I think.

643
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,860
I think if you and your goons
ever got a chance to do anything,

644
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:52,010
any of those people around
you'd all get your faces kicked in.

645
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:53,390
Is that right?
That's right!

646
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,350
Does that go for your beaner
boyfriend, too?

647
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,340
I don't have a beaner boyfriend.

648
00:53:57,620 --> 00:54:00,080
But if you're talking about a
certain person that works here,

649
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:02,140
I'd say that goes especially
for him.

650
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:05,790
I'm gonna walk home.

651
00:54:12,310 --> 00:54:14,460
That was incredible.

652
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,160
Are we leaving?

653
00:54:20,050 --> 00:54:21,530
Yup, we're leavin'.

654
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,430
What a show!

655
00:54:34,350 --> 00:54:37,790
Remind me never to get Jane
that mad at me.

656
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,900
She ate Todd up and spit
him out.

657
00:54:41,480 --> 00:54:44,080
I can see pieces of him all
over the driveway.

658
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,720
Hey, where you goin'?

659
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,200
It time to go.

660
00:54:53,720 --> 00:54:55,000
You all right?

661
00:54:55,110 --> 00:54:56,470
All right, yes.

662
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:58,420
I'll see you tomorrow.

663
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:06,000
What is this, huh?

664
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:08,500
Get a little soft,
huh, Blakey boy.

665
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,510
Why don't you go back up
there to Jane

666
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,250
and tell her how great you
are now.

667
00:55:13,430 --> 00:55:15,170
Yeah, she'll cuddle
right up to ya.

668
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,040
Come on, this is your big
chance to win her heart.

669
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,820
Okay, fine, walk home and
don't say anything.

670
00:55:23,930 --> 00:55:26,460
It's no skin off my nose.
All right. I'll say something.

671
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,660
Jane is right!

672
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:39,370
Get out!
What?

673
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:41,220
Get out, I said.
Hurry up!

674
00:55:41,290 --> 00:55:42,610
Randy?
Todd?

675
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,340
Shut up! Look, get out
right now!

676
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:46,050
Make couple seconds or you're
gonna be trapped...

677
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:47,660
And you're not gonna like it!

678
00:55:47,730 --> 00:55:49,180
Come on!

679
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:55,590
So, you think Jane was
right, huh?

680
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:57,580
Well, let's find out.
What are you gonna do?

681
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,190
Watch!

682
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:00,880
Todd!

683
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,710
Ira, go get your dad!

684
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,200
What's goin' on?
Just go get him.

685
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,680
Hurry!

686
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,260
Todd, don't do this!

687
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,030
This isn't right.
Shut up!

688
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,710
What's goin' on?
Todd's gone crazy.

689
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,830
This isn't just calling names
and picking fights.

690
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:51,050
This is bad, Todd, come on!
Shu up!

691
00:56:52,830 --> 00:56:54,250
Oscar!

692
00:57:06,780 --> 00:57:08,170
Come on!

693
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:10,450
You wanna kick my face in now?
Come on!

694
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:15,980
Come on! Come on, hurry up!

695
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:27,340
There's Todd's car.

696
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,250
Down here.

697
00:57:48,970 --> 00:57:50,860
I'll get an ambulance.
There's no time for that.

698
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,800
Let's get him out. Right.
Be carefull.

699
00:57:54,790 --> 00:57:56,350
Let's get him in the back.

700
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,480
I'll go get Todd.

701
00:58:27,380 --> 00:58:29,000
George, what happened?

702
00:58:29,070 --> 00:58:31,600
I don't have time to explain.
Just get in and get us to the hospital.

703
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,220
I wanna go, too.
Ira, please stay.

704
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,140
Where's Todd?

705
00:58:58,820 --> 00:59:01,040
Where is he?!
I didn't want that to happen!

706
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:04,620
Then why didn't you do
something?!

707
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,730
I didn't want that to happen.

708
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,500
Why didn't I do something?

709
01:00:24,410 --> 01:00:26,640
Everything was different after
that night.

710
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:29,590
Marcus was in the hospital and...

711
01:00:30,690 --> 01:00:33,000
there was this sudden change
of feeling.

712
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:36,240
Like a wall had gone up
between us.

713
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:38,150
We all felt it immediately.

714
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:40,200
What did they say?

715
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,900
They didn't have to say
anything.

716
01:00:42,950 --> 01:00:44,450
What do you mean?

717
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:48,350
Well, it was like they connected
us to what had happened.

718
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,570
But you didn't do anything.

719
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:53,450
Yeah, but try and put yourself
in their position.

720
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:56,190
I mean, one night suddenly
some boys...

721
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:57,770
come driving through your home,

722
01:00:57,830 --> 01:00:59,670
and one of them was seriously
hurt.

723
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:03,650
Well, I think they did what we
all tend to do...

724
01:01:03,750 --> 01:01:05,500
when something bad happens,

725
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:08,630
Just lump people into groups.

726
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:12,600
And I think they lumped us into
the same group with those boys.

727
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:14,790
Do you see what I mean?

728
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:16,670
Not really.

729
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,790
Well, I didn't either.

730
01:01:21,150 --> 01:01:22,850
But all I could understand...

731
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,990
is that Oscar and me weren't
friends anymore.

732
01:01:27,590 --> 01:01:29,540
The workers were still doing
their job,

733
01:01:29,950 --> 01:01:31,740
but nothing was the same.

734
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:34,170
Oscar and me didn't play
anymore.

735
01:01:36,030 --> 01:01:38,410
He spent everyday in the
fields with his family...

736
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,210
because Marcus couldn't work.

737
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,590
One day when Marcus got out
of the hospital,

738
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,830
Jane and Blake went down to
see him,

739
01:01:49,060 --> 01:01:52,100
but his mother just told them
that he didn't want to see anybody.

740
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:01,710
Summer finally ended,

741
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,410
but the workers still weren't
finished.

742
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,900
Mom talked to Oscar's mother

743
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,920
and told her we could
hire more workers to help
finish...

744
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,800
the job before their permits
ran out.

745
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:13,340
But she told mom
they'd made a commitment

746
01:02:13,460 --> 01:02:15,140
and they would keep it.

747
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,330
Almost everyday I saw trucks
with other workers...

748
01:02:23,410 --> 01:02:25,330
heading south to go home
to mexico.

749
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:30,260
It was a sad time for me.

750
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:33,820
Those last days of summer
passed by very slowly.

751
01:02:55,790 --> 01:02:58,570
Hey, Ira! Is that your little
beaner boyfriend?

752
01:03:00,900 --> 01:03:02,740
Your little brother's got a
big mouth, Tim.

753
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,540
So? So...

754
01:03:05,010 --> 01:03:07,410
maybe you should talk with
him about his language.

755
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:09,370
Maybe I don't have a problem
with his language.

756
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:12,340
Maybe you won't have a problem
if I put my fist in his face then.

757
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:13,950
Stay out of this, Rene.

758
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,080
Since you put it that way,
Rene...

759
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:18,420
I know how tough you MacLaren
girls are.

760
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:21,440
Not so sure about the boys.

761
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:26,190
Just don't let 'em get to
you, Ira.

762
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,840
Yeah, just ignore them.

763
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,000
Did you really make friends
with a mexican?

764
01:03:49,070 --> 01:03:51,500
I mean, It really doesn't
matter to me.

765
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,850
Besides, I think those guys
on the bus are creeps.

766
01:03:55,210 --> 01:03:57,500
And I bet your sister could
have put 'em in their place.

767
01:03:59,870 --> 01:04:01,050
Who are you?

768
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:02,840
My name's Jim. I'm new.

769
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:06,370
Where'd you move from?

770
01:04:06,460 --> 01:04:08,010
American falls.

771
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:10,320
Ever heard of it?
Nice place.

772
01:04:11,050 --> 01:04:12,950
All eyes to the front now,
please.

773
01:04:15,610 --> 01:04:18,340
Who can tell me what's different
about becoming a sixth grader?

774
01:04:20,820 --> 01:04:23,140
Well, the first thing is we
get right to work.

775
01:04:23,660 --> 01:04:27,260
In fact, tonight all of you
will be going home with homework.

776
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,550
Hi.

777
01:04:46,270 --> 01:04:47,610
Hi.

778
01:04:47,990 --> 01:04:49,800
Saw you sitting here all alone.

779
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,180
Yeah, I think I got a disease
or something.

780
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:53,800
Better be careful.

781
01:04:54,130 --> 01:04:55,810
You look okay to me.

782
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:01,890
Are you lost?

783
01:05:01,980 --> 01:05:05,170
I don't like the way your sister
talked to me and my brother on the bus.

784
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:07,890
Well, why don't you go talk to
her, then.

785
01:05:10,170 --> 01:05:11,600
Very funny.

786
01:05:12,900 --> 01:05:14,570
I'm not trying to be funny.

787
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:17,060
I heard about what happened
on your farm...

788
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,880
How the mexi got hit
by the car.

789
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,730
We all think it would have
been a lot better

790
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:24,530
If more of the car had
hit him.

791
01:05:25,540 --> 01:05:27,030
Well, though.

792
01:05:27,160 --> 01:05:30,530
You know, it's too bad that his
whole family didn't get hit,

793
01:05:31,620 --> 01:05:32,930
If you ask me.

794
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:34,780
Well, she didn't ask you.

795
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:37,030
Watch your mouth, new boy.

796
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:38,930
Yes, sir.

797
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:41,190
So...

798
01:05:41,890 --> 01:05:45,290
what's it like having a mex
for a friend?

799
01:05:47,930 --> 01:05:49,310
That's what I thought.

800
01:05:49,390 --> 01:05:51,100
I wouldn't talk about it,
either.

801
01:06:20,050 --> 01:06:21,620
Here, can you take this?

802
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,060
Yeah.

803
01:06:23,810 --> 01:06:25,520
I'll see you inside.

804
01:06:33,070 --> 01:06:35,190
So, are you lost?

805
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:38,840
My friends aren't mexs or
anything else you call them.

806
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:42,300
They're people, just like you and me.
They are peolple.

807
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:45,870
I think they're greasy
little animals...

808
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,750
Things that like to eat bugs...

809
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:49,720
My friend's name is Oscar.

810
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:51,810
He's the best friend I ever had.

811
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:54,160
He's the best friend anyone
could ever have.

812
01:06:54,780 --> 01:06:57,270
I'd pick him for a friend
over anyone else,

813
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,590
So don't ever call him any of
your little names again.

814
01:07:08,610 --> 01:07:11,230
You better be ready to take back
what you said to me.

815
01:07:11,370 --> 01:07:13,210
I'm not gonna take it back.

816
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,460
Then you better be ready to fight.

817
01:07:16,110 --> 01:07:17,900
I'm not gonna fight, either.

818
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,520
Look, I'm not gonna fight

819
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,620
and I'm not gonna take back
what I said.

820
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:30,640
If you don't decide what you're
gonna do, we'll decide for you.

821
01:07:31,140 --> 01:07:34,700
It's three to one, Iris.

822
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:36,550
It's three to two.

823
01:07:39,820 --> 01:07:41,860
There's a fight on the
playground!

824
01:07:46,290 --> 01:07:47,680
Whatever it is, we'll take
care of it.

825
01:07:48,370 --> 01:07:50,140
Come on, Ira.
Let's go.

826
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:53,720
Mom.

827
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,310
Jim, what in the world...?

828
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,870
I'm  okay.
You got a great kid there.

829
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,820
You should be very proud
of him.

830
01:08:03,020 --> 01:08:04,480
See ya tomorrow, Ira.

831
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:07,070
Yeah, see ya.

832
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:08,640
Thanks.

833
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:42,040
Do you want to let any of those
deep thoughts spill out over to me?

834
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,260
I'm proud of you, Ira.

835
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:48,430
I just hate to see you get
into fights.

836
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,430
Why? 'Cuz I'm a girl.

837
01:08:50,660 --> 01:08:52,510
No, because I don't think
it's right.

838
01:08:53,010 --> 01:08:54,850
Do you think a fight on the
playground...

839
01:08:54,930 --> 01:08:56,920
changed those boys' minds
about anything?

840
01:08:58,410 --> 01:08:59,740
No.

841
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,990
But it wasn't really a fight.

842
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:04,120
I was just defending myself.

843
01:09:04,650 --> 01:09:06,290
Well, that's what the principal
told me.

844
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:08,040
Glad to hear you  say the
same thing.

845
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:10,490
You had every right to
defend yourself.

846
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,850
All I was trying to do
was stand up for Oscar.

847
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,160
I know you were. That was the
right thing to do.

848
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:19,250
Yeah, I guess.

849
01:09:20,410 --> 01:09:23,220
- But...
- What's the point of standing up for him?

850
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:25,300
It didn't do anything,

851
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,720
Except that everybody
hates me now.

852
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,840
Sometimes that's the price you
get paid for being a real friend.

853
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:34,920
Well, why should I be a real friend...

854
01:09:35,010 --> 01:09:37,210
to someone that doesn't want to
be my friend anymore?

855
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:39,430
Oscar hates me now too,

856
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:41,940
And I didn't even do anything
to him.

857
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,680
Are you really sorry you
stood up for Oscar?

858
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:47,050
Maybe.

859
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:49,680
Well, I'll tell you something.

860
01:09:50,190 --> 01:09:52,720
If Oscar had seen how you
stuck up for him today,

861
01:09:52,810 --> 01:09:54,640
he would feel a lot different.

862
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,840
Yeah, well...
He didn't see.

863
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,480
Hello.

864
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:39,970
How are you, Oscar?

865
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:41,560
Maria?

866
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:43,920
We've missed you.

867
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,610
I came over 'cuz I wanted
to tell you

868
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,550
about something that happened
to Ira today.

869
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:51,110
At school?

870
01:10:51,270 --> 01:10:52,770
At school, yes.

871
01:10:53,390 --> 01:10:55,100
I also brought this for you.

872
01:10:58,000 --> 01:10:59,770
She was going to give it to
you,

873
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:02,350
but after Marcus got hurt,

874
01:11:05,830 --> 01:11:08,590
What happened to Ira at school?

875
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,450
Hi.

876
01:11:21,630 --> 01:11:24,100
Hi. Is Iris here?

877
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:27,410
Oscar wants to know if Iris
is here.

878
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:30,100
Umm, no, she's outside,
somewhere.

879
01:11:30,300 --> 01:11:31,910
You want me to try and find
her?

880
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,310
No, I know where is.

881
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:41,680
I wonder if you could give
this to your friend.

882
01:11:42,250 --> 01:11:43,700
My friend?

883
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:46,510
The one who tried to help.

884
01:11:46,620 --> 01:11:48,060
Oh, you mean Blake.

885
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,250
Yeah, he helped the sheriff
find the boy

886
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:51,890
who was driving the car.

887
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:54,230
Yes, your mother tell me.

888
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,640
This tell him thank you
very much.

889
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:59,350
This will mean a lot to him.

890
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:00,890
I'll make sure he gets it.

891
01:12:01,020 --> 01:12:02,440
Thank you.

892
01:12:02,970 --> 01:12:05,020
It's nice to see you again.

893
01:12:09,660 --> 01:12:12,880
You know, i was just about
to go for a walk.

894
01:12:13,470 --> 01:12:15,030
Would you like to come?

895
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,980
We could talk some more.

896
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:20,350
Yes, yes, thank you.

897
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:47,760
I thought I'd bought the farm.

898
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,960
Yes, very spooked.

899
01:14:55,560 --> 01:14:57,890
Is that the end of the story?
Just about.

900
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,150
But that's why you drew
the picture, isn't it?

901
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,880
Because of what happened
with the snake.

902
01:15:01,970 --> 01:15:03,930
I didn't draw the picture.
Oscar did.

903
01:15:04,770 --> 01:15:06,790
Well, Oscar gave it to you?

904
01:15:07,390 --> 01:15:08,500
Sort of.

905
01:15:08,590 --> 01:15:10,290
Well, did he or didn't he?

906
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,960
Well, let me finish telling
you the story

907
01:15:13,030 --> 01:15:14,880
and you'll understand.

908
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:18,310
Hey, what's mom doin'?

909
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:32,950
Are you okay?

910
01:15:34,140 --> 01:15:35,420
Oh, yeah.

911
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:37,600
Just a little sad.

912
01:15:38,020 --> 01:15:39,390
Why?

913
01:15:39,950 --> 01:15:41,220
Well...

914
01:15:42,130 --> 01:15:44,820
U.S. immigration agents
came out today...

915
01:15:46,010 --> 01:15:48,610
and told our workers they had
to leave the country,
immediately.

916
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:50,360
Why did they do that?

917
01:15:51,230 --> 01:15:54,040
Their permits expired about
two or three weeks ago.

918
01:15:57,890 --> 01:15:59,370
So, they're gone?

919
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:41,400
I didn't even get to say
goodbye.

920
01:16:49,820 --> 01:16:51,620
Will we ever see them again?

921
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,180
I don't know.

922
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,390
Sometimes when they stay
as long as they did,

923
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,360
they don't let them come
back again.

924
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:05,220
Do you wanna ride back
with us?

925
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:13,450
Yeah, I guess.

926
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,330
What's that?

927
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,630
It's a story.

928
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,950
Did you ever see Oscar again?

929
01:18:13,270 --> 01:18:15,350
No, I never did.

930
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,470
But I've thought about him
many, many times.

931
01:18:21,350 --> 01:18:23,380
I've wondered where he
ended up living.

932
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:27,750
I've wondered if he had
a chance

933
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:29,750
to have a family like I did.

934
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:38,510
I've wondered if he thinks
about me

935
01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:40,570
and the time we spent together
that summer.

936
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:42,780
Do you ever wonder if he kept...

937
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,850
the picture that you
made for him?

938
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,620
I even wonder about that.

939
01:18:49,730 --> 01:18:51,110
Really?

940
01:18:51,250 --> 01:18:52,650
Really!

941
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:56,710
Because except for you and dad.

942
01:18:56,940 --> 01:18:58,950
And the rest of our family,

943
01:18:59,670 --> 01:19:01,960
I've never had a better friend
than Oscar.

944
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:03,970
I don't think I ever will.

945
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,290
Did you guys ever find out

946
01:19:14,370 --> 01:19:16,810
who was buried at the
old cemetery?

947
01:19:16,940 --> 01:19:18,640
Nope, we never did.

948
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:23,600
My attitude changed
toward the cemetery because Oscar.

949
01:19:24,660 --> 01:19:28,580
# Somewhere children are playing, #

950
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:32,460
# and somewhere children
are saying, #

951
01:19:32,650 --> 01:19:40,430
# I see that we don't look
the same. #

952
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:50,930
# Though now and then your
words are strange, #

953
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:55,120
# I wonder if we'll see the day #

954
01:19:55,320 --> 01:20:03,100
# Where you and I as friends
can stay. #

955
01:20:04,210 --> 01:20:05,810
Did your dad ever tell you

956
01:20:05,910 --> 01:20:08,030
what they do in scotland for
people who died?

957
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,960
Yeah?

958
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,630
I got an idea.

959
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:03,380
# In friendship's field #

960
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:07,900
# We'll meet each other.#

961
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:15,410
# We'll make our way there
to grow together. #

962
01:21:15,700 --> 01:21:22,640
# We'll find our way back home #

963
01:21:23,470 --> 01:21:26,590
# to friendship's field. #

964
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:32,330
# The years have come and gone, #

965
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,880
# but inside there still lives on #

966
01:21:36,310 --> 01:21:43,990
# All the strength you gave me,
warm and safe. #

967
01:21:46,170 --> 01:21:50,410
# Tonight I'm wishing on a star #

968
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:54,720
# Somehow the world will hear
my heart #

969
01:21:54,870 --> 01:22:02,450
# That reached-out arms
all feel the same. #

970
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:07,310
# That different's
just another way #

971
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:11,560
# And kindness leads us
to that place #

972
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:20,060
# Where soon we all
as friends can stay. #

973
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:28,800
# In friendship's field
we'll meet each other. #

974
01:22:28,850 --> 01:22:36,140
# We'll make our way there
to grow together. #

975
01:22:36,340 --> 01:22:43,500
# We'll find our way back home. #

976
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,690
# In friendship's field #

977
01:22:48,120 --> 01:22:51,600
# We are forever, #

978
01:22:51,740 --> 01:22:58,970
# Where friends together
are for each other. #

979
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:06,850
# We'll always be at home #

980
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,970
# in friendship's field. #

981
01:23:18,110 --> 01:23:22,670
# Tonight, I'm wishing on a star #

982
01:23:23,220 --> 01:23:33,110
# That all the world can hear
their hearts. #
