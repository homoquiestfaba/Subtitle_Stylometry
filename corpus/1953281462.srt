1
00:00:33,266 --> 00:00:35,268
Define "violence."

2
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,771
- What?
- Okay, everyone,

3
00:00:38,271 --> 00:00:40,774
I need you to step back.
Step back. Violence. Define it.

4
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,776
I don't know.
Violence?

5
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,779
You're making a movie about it.
Shouldn't you know what it is?

6
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:48,281
Maybe we should
just get ready.

7
00:00:48,281 --> 00:00:50,784
I'm ready.

8
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,286
All right, silence.

9
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:55,405
We're going in 20,
here we go.

10
00:00:55,405 --> 00:00:57,407
Try and define it.

11
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:59,409
Fifteen,
okay, bring it in now.

12
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:01,411
In my line of work,

13
00:01:01,411 --> 00:01:03,913
if you don't know what
something really is...
ten, nine,

14
00:01:04,414 --> 00:01:06,416
instead of what it looks like,
eight, seven,

15
00:01:06,416 --> 00:01:08,418
you don't mess with it,
six, five,

16
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:10,420
or you could get
yourself killed.
Four, three,

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,922
hold your places, everyone.
That's good.
Two, one.

18
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:18,928
And cut!

19
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:21,931
Way to go!

20
00:01:21,931 --> 00:01:25,935
Beautiful.
I think we've got it.
No, no.

21
00:01:25,935 --> 00:01:28,938
We got a problem down here.
Oh, boy.

22
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,441
Get the paramedics
down here immediately.
You're okay.

23
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:34,828
We have an accident.
Hold on.

24
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:58,411
Something about that day
reminded me of when I was a kid.

25
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:01,414
We lived by the sea.
A tiny town.

26
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:05,668
Lots of fishing boats.
One movie theater.

27
00:03:05,668 --> 00:03:08,171
My brother fished.

28
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:10,673
I watched movies.

29
00:03:10,673 --> 00:03:14,677
They got me wondering what
we'd do if we were ever attacked.

30
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:18,681
We suddenly seemed
so vulnerable to killer sharks,
nuclear submarines,

31
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,184
an alien invasion.

32
00:03:21,684 --> 00:03:23,686
The enemy
could come from anywhere.

33
00:03:24,687 --> 00:03:28,191
The land, the water, the sky,
the chinese.

34
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:33,196
Couldn't trust
any of 'em anymore.

35
00:03:33,196 --> 00:03:36,699
Yeah, Brian.
Mike, I've gone through
the whole thing.

36
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:38,701
There's absolutely
nothing you can do.

37
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:41,204
You're telling me
you couldn't find
one loophole?

38
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:44,707
- I went over it all night.
- Who wrote that contract, Brian?

39
00:03:44,707 --> 00:03:46,709
Look, I can
call Tokyo for you.

40
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:50,213
No.
Okay.

41
00:03:50,713 --> 00:03:53,216
Guess I've been kinda edgy
ever since.

42
00:03:54,717 --> 00:03:56,719
Looking over my shoulder.

43
00:03:58,221 --> 00:04:02,225
Always ready
for that sudden attack.

44
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:11,234
- Claire, go ahead.
- Welcome back. How was your flight?

45
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:17,240
Oshima called from Tokyo.
She said the three million
won't be in the account...

46
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,742
till Friday noon,
our time.

47
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:21,744
The studio said they are only
releasing the video in June.

48
00:04:21,744 --> 00:04:24,247
You can sue them.
Brian doesn't think you'll win.

49
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:26,249
Yeah, I know he doesn't.

50
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:30,753
Listen, I don't want
you to take any more
of Briars fucking calls!

51
00:04:33,256 --> 00:04:37,260
Tell them I gotta
talk to them myself.
It's urgent.

52
00:04:59,282 --> 00:05:01,784
Seeds of violence
got through the night shoot,

53
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:04,287
but there was an accident
with one of the stunts.

54
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:09,292
- Cat, the stuntwoman for daisy,
got hurt in the explosion.
- How is she?

55
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,295
She cut her face
and got banged up,
but she's fine.

56
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:15,298
Did we get the shot?

57
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:18,301
Yeah, it looks great.

58
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:20,803
- Great.
- On the other picture
there was a problem.

59
00:05:21,304 --> 00:05:24,807
- The company
was actually evacuated.
- Uh, Claire?

60
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:26,309
- Yeah?
- I gotta put you on hold.

61
00:05:26,309 --> 00:05:28,561
Okay.

62
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:36,069
Yeah?
I'm leaving...

63
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:40,073
where are you going?
You.

64
00:05:42,575 --> 00:05:45,578
What?

65
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,081
I'm leaving you.
Honey.

66
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:51,584
I can't get your attention
anymore.

67
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:54,587
I'm not sure I want it.

68
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,590
Where you gonna go?
Guatemala.

69
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,094
- What?
- I was thinking
about guatemala.

70
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:04,347
Guatemala?
You have a yearning
for squalor?

71
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,467
Life.

72
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:14,474
I have a yearning for life.
Real life.

73
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,476
Christ, not again.

74
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,481
Paige, look, uh,

75
00:06:21,981 --> 00:06:26,486
I'm coming upstairs.

76
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:30,990
I'm coming in a minute.
I've been waiting
for this call.

77
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:43,503
Yeah?
I've got hiyawa on the line.

78
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,505
All right.
Put me through.
It's early morning there.

79
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,525
Look,

80
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,028
my highly overpaid lawyers
are confident we can win
this on three counts.

81
00:07:09,028 --> 00:07:12,532
How can this be possible?
I have to check
with our new york lawyers.

82
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,535
Be my guest.
This will take time.

83
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:17,537
You have all day.
You'll hear from us.

84
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:20,540
I look forward to it.

85
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:31,050
Go ahead, Claire.

86
00:07:31,434 --> 00:07:36,055
Six is here. He wants to know
whether you're gonna use
his title track forviolence.

87
00:07:36,055 --> 00:07:40,560
Yo, Mike.
What's up, baby?
How's that view?

88
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,062
Look, man,
you know my shit is phat.

89
00:07:43,062 --> 00:07:47,066
It's hot, man.
So you gonna be using it
or you gonna be losing it?

90
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:50,069
Go ahead and show me
the Dailies and you can
put the song on over it.

91
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:54,073
Okay, one more thing.
Someone dumped a 400-page file
into your e-mail.

92
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:58,077
Some weird, secret FBI file
with diagrams.

93
00:07:58,077 --> 00:08:01,080
An FBI file in my e-mail?

94
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,584
Yeah, about some new
surveillance system.

95
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,088
That's it?
Nothing from the pope?

96
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,090
Ha ha.
Check it yourself.

97
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,593
Remember we did research on
high-tech crime forviolence?

98
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:16,095
Anyway, here's the Dailies
and Six's demo track.

99
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:30,610
You never quite realize
the way things affect you.

100
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:34,614
When I was a kid movies scared
the shit out of me,

101
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,617
so then when I grew up,

102
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,119
I went into
the movie business.

103
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:45,625
Turned what you could call
a basic fear of strangers...

104
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:48,628
into a multimillion-dollar
enterprise.

105
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:51,631
After all, paranoia
is our number one export.

106
00:08:51,764 --> 00:08:53,766
Everybody needs an enemy.

107
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:59,772
It's only now I've come
to understand that there are
no enemies or strangers...

108
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,774
just a strange world.

109
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,731
Good morning, guys.

110
00:10:34,734 --> 00:10:36,736
Don't you guys ever sleep?

111
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,279
Hey, Ray.

112
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:24,283
If you're so smart,
why not try getting a license?
You could drive to work.

113
00:11:24,283 --> 00:11:27,286
Oh, and good morning
to you too.

114
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:32,291
Truth is, I try
to avoid modern technology
whenever I can.

115
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:35,795
Hey, you still
want the tr-5 macros
linked to your base matrix?

116
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:39,799
Do you have them rigged up yet?
What have you been doing
all night?

117
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:43,803
Just teasing.
See ya.

118
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:47,807
Dispatch, this is 2-mary-19.
We have a visual on suspects.

119
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:49,809
10-4, 2-mary-19.

120
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,313
Dispatch, 2-mary-19.
Suspects are being
questioned at location.

121
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:56,816
10-4, 2-mary-19.

122
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:31,350
Hey, we'll have another 25 X-rs
going by Friday,

123
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,353
all with the 10-to-500 zooms.

124
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,355
Mmm. Good.

125
00:12:36,355 --> 00:12:39,608
- Trying to keep up with you, Ray.
- You're doing good down there.

126
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,613
- I'll check in with you later.
- We're here.

127
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,947
No, she did not
over-rotate.

128
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:14,954
Mm-hmm.

129
00:14:17,957 --> 00:14:19,959
Mm-hmm.

130
00:14:22,461 --> 00:14:24,964
The scene? Yeah.

131
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,469
I talked to
the stunt coordinator
and the insurance guy.

132
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:33,973
They say the whole thing
can be attributed
to our negligence.

133
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,977
She can definitely sue
if she wanted to.
Oh, fuck!

134
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:41,480
You might want to stop
by the hospital and talk to her
before the meeting.

135
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,524
Oh.

136
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,051
Okay, where is she?
She's right in there.

137
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:02,061
Wow. Am I delirious, or is
a famous Hollywood producer
coming to visit me?

138
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:10,069
You're delirious.

139
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:15,574
Ohh!
You're a pro.

140
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:18,577
And you're brave.

141
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:21,580
And you're beautiful.
What's the catch?

142
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:25,084
A sick sense of humor.

143
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,088
I don't know about that.
I...

144
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:34,593
- I don't have to answer this.
- Please.

145
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,098
Yeah?
Is this a good time, Mike?

146
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,600
No, I'm coming...
in a minute.
Don't start.

147
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,104
- Go on. It's okay.
- Hang on.

148
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,606
Mm-hmm.

149
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:52,611
You're the stuff.

150
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:58,117
- Okay, yes?
- Hey.

151
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:01,120
I wasn't going
to sue you anyway.

152
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,626
Get out.

153
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:11,630
Hang on, Brian.
Claire, call Zoltan...

154
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,133
and have 'em screen-test Cat
for the part of the sister.

155
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,635
Cat?
She's a stuntwoman,
not an actress.

156
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:20,139
Schwarzenegger.

157
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,641
Everybody there? Brian?
Yeah.

158
00:17:23,142 --> 00:17:24,643
You're fired.
What?

159
00:17:25,144 --> 00:17:29,648
Why? Because I don't pay
lawyers to tell me I can't win.

160
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,651
Look, take some time,
wrap it up.

161
00:17:32,651 --> 00:17:34,653
Do me a favor.

162
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:38,157
Plot your revenge
on your own time.
Mike...

163
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,659
Let's go.

184
00:18:03,699... > 00:18:06,201
Senora! Senora!

164
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,714
Mike.
Honey, I'm glad
I caught you.

165
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:21,216
I know we didn't get to talk.
I'm sorry.

166
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:24,219
I made some reservations...

167
00:18:24,219 --> 00:18:27,723
Mike, I'm losing you.
Hey. Hey. Hey.

168
00:18:27,723 --> 00:18:31,226
Hey! Hey!
Jesus!

169
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:33,228
What the fuck... hey!

170
00:18:33,228 --> 00:18:35,230
Hey!
Mike?

171
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:50,496
All right, this is good.
Right here.

172
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,503
Kill him.

173
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,007
Kill him.

174
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,512
You kill him.
Oh, man!

175
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,516
Just kill him.

176
00:19:10,516 --> 00:19:12,518
Yeah?

177
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:14,520
You just kill him.

178
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,522
Lowell,

179
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:19,525
kill him... now.

180
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:21,527
Shit. Thanks
for mentioning my name.

181
00:19:21,527 --> 00:19:24,530
It don't matter if I mention
your stupid, inbred name.

182
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:27,533
He's about to die.
Now shoot him!

183
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:29,535
You shoot him.

184
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:34,540
You don't want
that mercedes anymore?
Yeah, I want it.

185
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,042
Well, if we don't kill him,

186
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:40,045
they probably won't give us
the money, will they?

187
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:43,048
And they might
kill us instead.

188
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,050
Do you understand?

189
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:49,054
We kill him...
we live, plus mercedes.

190
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:54,059
We don't...
we die, minus mercedes.

191
00:19:56,061 --> 00:19:58,063
You choose.

192
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:08,073
Lowell, you've got...

193
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,576
five seconds to tell me...

194
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:13,579
what the fuck
this is really all about.

195
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,081
Five seconds?
I'm not sure I could...

196
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,584
three.
I didn't think
it'd be so hard!

197
00:20:19,084 --> 00:20:21,587
What's hard about it?
Bullshit. Two.

198
00:20:21,587 --> 00:20:23,589
Oh, man, no!
This is it!

199
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:27,092
It's all gone downill.
Don't you see that?

200
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,595
No. One!
No, no, no!

201
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,098
Fuck! Wait!
All right.

202
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,601
All right, fine.
I'll tell you.

203
00:20:38,604 --> 00:20:40,606
Uh...

204
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,611
Uh...

205
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:50,115
I like him.

206
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,117
I like him.

207
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,620
What? Who?

208
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,122
Him.

209
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:59,124
His name's Mike Max.
Remember?

210
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:05,130
I was talking to him in
the garage while I covered him.

211
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:08,634
- You were talking to him?
- I'm telling you,
he made some good points.

212
00:21:09,134 --> 00:21:12,137
Max... made good points?

213
00:21:12,638 --> 00:21:15,140
He said we were
wasting our talents...

214
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,142
taking risks that were
not necessary for peanuts.

215
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,144
We had the guts
and the brains to kidnap him.

216
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:25,150
If we did that,
then there's executive jobs
that we could make fortunes in.

217
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,152
You on fucking drugs again?

218
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:29,655
I'm telling ya,
he's right.

219
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:32,157
I mean,
this is going nowhere.

220
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:34,660
He sussed it.
This guy's amazing.

221
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,662
Think about it now.

222
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:39,164
You don't wanna
kill him.

223
00:21:39,665 --> 00:21:42,167
I don't wanna
kill him.

224
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:46,672
Maybe there's some other way
we can enter the 20th century
driving a mercedes.

225
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:50,175
I am not going back
to stealing!

226
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:52,678
Maybe there's other stuff
we could do.

227
00:21:52,678 --> 00:21:55,681
What other stuff?
I don't know.
Something.

228
00:21:56,181 --> 00:21:58,684
Some... business.

229
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,687
We could go into business,
maybe.

230
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,690
Maybe... maybe
the entertainment business.

231
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,698
The what?

232
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:18,203
Now I've fucking heard
everything!

233
00:22:18,203 --> 00:22:21,206
Shh! Shh!
Keep it down.

234
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:25,210
First you talk
to the hostage.

235
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:28,714
Then you renege
on your part.

236
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:32,334
And now,
now you wanna go...

237
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:35,337
into the entertainment
business!

238
00:22:49,985 --> 00:22:53,989
What kind of bullshit
you been telling him?

239
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:55,991
It's not bullshit.

240
00:22:55,991 --> 00:23:00,495
- He produced your favorite movie.
- It's true.

241
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:02,497
It happens
to be my favorite too.

242
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:09,504
In my pocket...
is my card.

243
00:23:11,506 --> 00:23:17,012
You have your what?

244
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:19,514
Your...
your card? Huh?

245
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:22,017
You want me to take
your fucking card?

246
00:23:22,017 --> 00:23:25,020
- You dipshit, slimy,
no-good little weasel!
- Frank... no.

247
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,523
Huh? Huh?
Let me give you
my business card.

248
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:34,029
You know what you can both do
with your stupid, stinking,
fucking entertainment business?

249
00:23:34,029 --> 00:23:36,031
Jesus, Frank, no!

250
00:23:36,031 --> 00:23:38,033
I want to give you...

251
00:23:38,033 --> 00:23:41,036
a million bucks...

252
00:23:41,036 --> 00:23:43,038
in points.

253
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,543
Points!

254
00:23:48,543 --> 00:23:51,546
What the hell's "points" mean?

255
00:23:51,546 --> 00:23:55,050
It means a piece
of the profits.

256
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:59,054
It means...
a percentage.

257
00:23:59,054 --> 00:24:02,057
It means percentage!

258
00:24:02,557 --> 00:24:05,060
When was the last time
somebody gave you percentage?

259
00:24:06,561 --> 00:24:08,063
Shut up, Lowell,

260
00:24:08,563 --> 00:24:10,065
or I will torture you.

261
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:12,567
Never is when.

262
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:14,569
Never did, never will.

263
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:23,078
Come over here.
Come over here.

264
00:24:28,083 --> 00:24:30,085
One more...

265
00:24:30,085 --> 00:24:32,587
fucking chirp,

266
00:24:32,587 --> 00:24:36,091
and there's gonna be
a percentage of your carcass...

267
00:24:36,091 --> 00:24:38,593
all over this hill!

268
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:11,126
Hi, Ray.

269
00:25:12,627 --> 00:25:15,130
Didn't think
I'd find you there so late.

270
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,634
Anyway, I'm finally sending you
a cleaning lady... mathilda.

271
00:25:20,135 --> 00:25:22,637
She'll start tomorrow.
She's from salvador.

272
00:25:23,638 --> 00:25:26,641
She passed security.

273
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:29,144
Speaks five words of english,
badly.

274
00:25:29,144 --> 00:25:32,147
Her family was wiped out
by the death squads,

275
00:25:32,147 --> 00:25:35,150
except for
her little daughter.

276
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,653
They have you working late
at nasa every night like this?

277
00:25:39,154 --> 00:25:41,656
Yeah. Um,
why don't you, uh...

278
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:44,659
why don't you
send her over?

279
00:25:46,161 --> 00:25:48,163
Okay.

280
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:52,167
Get some sleep.

281
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:08,683
What the fuck?

282
00:26:16,057 --> 00:26:19,060
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

283
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:26,067
So dark and empty, with spikes
in the aing and the room
so small it sweats.

284
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:28,570
But I know it's no different
on the street,

285
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:32,073
except if you get shot,
be one of them
lucky victims you can see.

286
00:26:32,073 --> 00:26:36,077
"Drive by. Drive by."
Everybody love to say it.

287
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:39,080
But when you're in that room
you can lie there, play dead,

288
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,082
stand up on your head.

289
00:26:41,082 --> 00:26:44,586
Make no difference.
Daddy don't go by.

290
00:26:45,086 --> 00:26:48,590
He comes inside.
He comes right in.

291
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,592
After a hard day
at whittier,

292
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:56,097
he comes all the way
inside that room,
that bed, my pajamas.

293
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:59,601
He comes all the way
inside my room,
and he don't stop there.

294
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:02,604
He goes inside my crack,
and he don't stop there.

295
00:27:02,604 --> 00:27:07,108
He keeps going, tearing
everything apart while he
makes them sweet loving sounds,

296
00:27:07,108 --> 00:27:09,110
and he don't stop there.

297
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,114
He calls me names so hard
and bad it hurts my heart
more than it hurts my crack,

298
00:27:13,114 --> 00:27:15,116
and he don't stop there.

299
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:18,620
See, he's lookir
for my soul.

300
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:21,623
Everything they took from him
he wanted back.

301
00:27:22,123 --> 00:27:24,125
He's starving for it,

302
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:26,628
starving so bad
he'd kill me for it.

303
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,631
But I don't want to die.

304
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:31,633
I don't want to die.

305
00:27:31,633 --> 00:27:34,135
I don't want to die.

306
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:38,139
So I flip the script,
trick the dick and make him
think he got it all.

307
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,644
I make him think he got it all.
Make him think he got it all.

308
00:27:42,644 --> 00:27:45,647
And I slip away inside my head
and visit...

309
00:27:45,647 --> 00:27:49,150
the princess of beverly hills.

310
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:53,655
Haing blond, eyes green,

311
00:27:54,155 --> 00:27:56,658
painting her fingernails
like jellybeans,

312
00:27:57,158 --> 00:27:59,160
vanilla skin shimmering.

313
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,163
She don't even notice
when I slip inside her soul...

314
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:05,166
like a ghost
in a crystal palace.

315
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:09,170
I be all up in there eating
sugar cakes and bonbons and...

316
00:28:10,171 --> 00:28:13,174
she don't even notice me
while I'm inside her soul.

317
00:28:14,676 --> 00:28:18,179
See, she ain't never
needed to know
she needed a soul.

318
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,683
# Don't even know
she got one #

319
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:26,187
and I watch her...
I'm so close...

320
00:28:26,187 --> 00:28:29,190
while her fingernails dry.

321
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:32,694
And the princess,
she don't feel a thing.

322
00:28:33,194 --> 00:28:36,698
She can't smell
the burning knife
that's splitting me in half.

323
00:28:36,698 --> 00:28:41,202
One time, I think,
she smiled at me,
I think she saved my life.

324
00:28:41,202 --> 00:28:44,706
And now...

325
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,710
it's over...

326
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,713
and daddy start to cry.

327
00:28:53,715 --> 00:28:57,719
We go walking and talkir
in macan'thur park,

328
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:01,222
and I forgive him sometimes.

329
00:29:01,222 --> 00:29:03,725
The princess
of beverly hills...

330
00:29:04,225 --> 00:29:06,227
I don't need her soul
no more.

331
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,732
I give her back to you.

332
00:29:36,257 --> 00:29:37,759
I, uh...

333
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:43,765
I never knew
my father.

334
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:48,269
Transition to the southbound
side of the santa ana freeway.

335
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,773
Disabled big rig in
the left lane. Backed up
to the pasadena freeway.

336
00:29:51,773 --> 00:29:54,776
Montebello, a sig alert
for the 60 eastbound at finley.

337
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:56,778
The freeway's still closed
because of an accident.

338
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,281
What is the point
of you having a phone...

339
00:30:00,281 --> 00:30:03,284
if you don't answer it?

340
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:15,797
What the hell
are you doing here?

341
00:30:15,797 --> 00:30:18,299
Yesterday,
ten days, any days.

342
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,301
You never...

343
00:30:20,802 --> 00:30:23,805
you didn't send me my...

344
00:30:25,306 --> 00:30:27,308
I know, dad.

345
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:30,311
What should I do?

346
00:30:34,816 --> 00:30:38,319
What is your dad for?

347
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,322
Hmm?

348
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:47,328
Dad, I wish
you'd answer the phone.

349
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:50,331
It's important for me...

350
00:30:50,331 --> 00:30:52,333
that I know
that you're okay.

351
00:30:54,335 --> 00:30:56,337
All right, okay.
I'll buy that.

352
00:30:56,337 --> 00:30:58,339
Okay, good.
I got your favorite.

353
00:31:00,842 --> 00:31:04,345
Pepperoni.
You first.

354
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:06,848
Go ahead.

355
00:31:09,851 --> 00:31:11,352
Mmm.

356
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:24,365
Oh, I'm tired.

357
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:30,872
You know,

358
00:31:31,873 --> 00:31:33,875
I was right, dad.

359
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:39,380
I was more right than
I could ever have imagined.

360
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:52,527
Give me a second.
I'll call it back in.

361
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:55,029
We already checked it out.
We didn't find nothing.

362
00:31:55,029 --> 00:31:58,032
Oh, man. Jeez.

363
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:00,034
Yeah, they're, uh...

364
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:03,538
they were blown off.

365
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:07,542
Shotgun, three feet.
Uninged, clean at
the cortex.

366
00:32:08,042 --> 00:32:11,546
That one, two feet max,
between the cerebellum
and the frontal lobe.

367
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:14,048
Yeah, what'd I say?
Headless.

368
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:17,051
I heard they I.D.'d
the killer.

369
00:32:17,418 --> 00:32:21,422
See, that's where I took
the liberty of saying
"only in Hollywood."

370
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:25,426
So the killer's
a deranged hooker?

371
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:28,930
No, he was a regular guy.
Uh-huh.

372
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,932
Just liked to kill
on the weekends.

373
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:33,935
Nope, no record
of his killing
on weekends.

374
00:32:33,935 --> 00:32:35,937
MacDermot, come on.
Be a little more creative.

375
00:32:35,937 --> 00:32:39,941
There's two people dead here.
You guys are a little cynical,
aren't you?

376
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:42,443
Okay,
here's the spin.

377
00:32:42,944 --> 00:32:45,947
The gentleman in question,
the apparent killer,

378
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:48,449
was, in fact,
originally the victim.

379
00:32:48,449 --> 00:32:50,952
You got that?
The killer was
the kidnap victim...

380
00:32:50,952 --> 00:32:54,455
who was brought here
by these two
now-headless kidnappers,

381
00:32:54,956 --> 00:32:58,459
a Mr. Lowell Lewis
and a Mr. Frank Cray,

382
00:32:58,459 --> 00:33:01,462
and during
an apparent altercation
between the two of them,

383
00:33:01,462 --> 00:33:06,968
said victim, Mr. Michael Max,
the guy they carjacked
in that mercedes there,

384
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:09,971
freed himself
and blew both theing heads off.

385
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:13,474
Wait a minute.
Michael Max...
Mike Max the producer?

386
00:33:17,478 --> 00:33:19,480
I know who this guy is.

387
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,984
This guy's great.
Did you see creative killing?

388
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:25,987
What is the other one...
odd sudden death.

389
00:33:25,987 --> 00:33:28,990
You see odd sudden death?
He's great.
Yeah, yeah.

390
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:30,992
This is very, uh, uh...

391
00:33:30,992 --> 00:33:34,495
it's, like,
very realistic action,
murder, real crime-type stuff.

392
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:37,999
Is that his car?
Let me go check out his car.

393
00:33:37,999 --> 00:33:40,001
We have a film buff,
MacDermot.

394
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,255
I'm Ruby.

395
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:49,761
I'm Ruby.

396
00:33:51,262 --> 00:33:53,264
Hi. I'm Ruby.

397
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,769
Uh, what now?

398
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:05,777
I want to fuck you.

399
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,781
Can I do my line first?

400
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,784
Sure.

401
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:16,287
- Great. What is it?
- "I want to fuck you."

402
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,292
I'm sorry.
I thought... good.

403
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:24,295
Very good.

404
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,297
Um...

405
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:29,801
I don't remember that line
from my script.

406
00:34:31,803 --> 00:34:37,308
"Ruby: Hi. I'm Ruby.
I want to fuck you."

407
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,812
"Jack: Well,
that's very honest.

408
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,816
- I want to fuck you too."
- You're joking.

409
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:49,821
No. This part is bad
on purpose, just like
a cheap porno movie.

410
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:52,824
And then, all of a sudden,
it gets good.

411
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:55,326
That's the trick.

412
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,829
Oh, so that's
the trick.

413
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,831
That's the trick.

414
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:04,836
Maybe Mike was right.
She can do it, but...

415
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:09,340
she doesn't work
for another month.
It'll be fine.

416
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:13,845
Are you still rolling?

417
00:35:25,106 --> 00:35:27,608
You must be mathilda.
Si, gentleman.

418
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:30,611
...florinda.

419
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:45,186
El hospital?
No. No.
No hospital.

420
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,692
No.
No, not the house.

421
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:54,195
- Senor...
- Hmm?

422
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:13,097
Maybe I jinxed him.
Who?

423
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:15,099
Weren't you gonna ask me
about Mike?

424
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,101
I was just
building up to it.

425
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,104
You're a pretty slow
builder.

426
00:37:20,104 --> 00:37:22,106
I was gonna say...

427
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,109
here we are,
studios.

428
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:27,612
You're beautiful.

429
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:30,615
Movies, murder.

430
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,618
I was gonna segue
into it from there.
Crafty.

431
00:37:33,618 --> 00:37:37,622
Med school.
Clinical psych.
Hmm.

432
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:41,626
I was always curious...
why people do what they do.

433
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:46,130
And now, who cares?
You just wanna
find your man.

434
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:49,133
No, I wanna find my woman,
marry, settle down.

435
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,137
I wanna find my man first,
I guess.

436
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:55,640
Unless my man turns out
to be a woman.

437
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:59,644
Better than if your woman
turns out to be a man, I suppose.

438
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,647
You know, you have
an interesting approach, Doc.

439
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:07,652
We have barely spoken,
and yet I feel I could be
a murder suspect or a fiancee.

440
00:38:10,154 --> 00:38:12,156
Sorry.
No offense.

441
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:17,662
# 'Cause I'd miss you
forever #
you could be.

442
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:23,167
# So love me right now #
I'd better get this
back to wardrobe.

443
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:27,171
# For it won't last #

444
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,174
hey, you're a cop.

445
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:32,176
Define "violence."

446
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:40,184
# 'Cause I'd miss you forever #
uh, fear, absence of love,
emotional revenge.

447
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:44,188
# Every time #

448
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:50,194
# every time #

449
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,197
# every #
hmm.

450
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,597
What the hell
are you doing?

451
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,600
Do you realize
what you've just
thrown away?

452
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,604
Little things around here
have big importance.
Do you understand?

453
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,608
Big importance.
Mucho importante.
Importante! Understand?

454
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:24,111
I can't have people around here
who don't know what's what.

455
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:30,117
Then again,
I can't afford
people who do.

456
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,132
You cannot stay here.

457
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:48,135
Not possible here.
Understand?

458
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:50,137
You must stay outside.

459
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:54,642
Yes? Thank you.

460
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:04,151
That girl can never
be allowed in here
under any circumstances.

461
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,154
Do you understand that?
Never.

462
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,662
Okay.

463
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:17,164
Here... no.

464
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:21,168
There... si.

465
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:25,673
Comprende?
Si, gentleman.

466
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,675
Good.

467
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,719
No.

468
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:13,721
Mike's discovered
a lot of people.

469
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,841
He sees something in them
no one else sees.

470
00:41:16,841 --> 00:41:18,843
He believes in them.

471
00:41:18,843 --> 00:41:20,845
His love is like a rocket...

472
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:25,349
it blasts you forward
into your future,
into your destiny.

473
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:27,351
But no matter who you are,
sooner or later,

474
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:32,356
you wake up in
your shiny new rocket...
alone...

475
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:35,359
and realize
he's in the cockpit,
and he has the keys.

476
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,364
The view is amazing.

477
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,869
But somewhere
in the back of your mind,

478
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,371
you can hear
the crash coming,

479
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:51,876
somewhere, somehow,
anytime.

480
00:41:53,878 --> 00:41:55,880
Some people
don't like that feeling.

481
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:01,385
I suppose everyone's
wanted to kill him
at some point.

482
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,388
I know I have.

483
00:42:07,892 --> 00:42:09,894
Do you think
he's still alive?

484
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:13,397
Absolutely.
But I'm an optimist.

485
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:18,903
I mean, there's no evidence
that he's dead.
Maybe he's in shock.

486
00:42:18,903 --> 00:42:21,405
Maybe he's unable
to communicate,
for one reason or another.

487
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,411
Do you think...

488
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:33,918
feelings, intentions,
bad thoughts...

489
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:38,923
can have an effect
on reality, like,

490
00:42:38,923 --> 00:42:41,425
sort of...

491
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:43,928
unintentional prayers?

492
00:42:43,928 --> 00:42:47,431
Definitely. I think
everything's connected.

493
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,934
Did you know that
in nuclear physics,

494
00:42:49,934 --> 00:42:52,937
if you just look at
a so-called particle,
you change it?

495
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:57,942
Imagine, just by looking
at something you can actually
change what it is.

496
00:42:57,942 --> 00:42:59,944
Sometimes you can even
destroy it.

497
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,947
It's like turning on the light
to see the darkness.

498
00:43:04,448 --> 00:43:06,450
We know what we look at
can change us. Take me.

499
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:09,954
One of the main reasons
I'm standing here is because
of your husband's movies.

500
00:43:09,954 --> 00:43:12,957
Now I'm here fighting crime,
and he's a victim of it.

501
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,960
We're connected,
and we never even met.

502
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:20,464
God only knows the amount
of subnuclear transference
that goes on in a marriage.

503
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:22,967
It's almost incalculable.
Why do you ask?

504
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:39,984
No, no.

505
00:43:58,752 --> 00:44:01,255
I didn't know where I was,

506
00:44:01,255 --> 00:44:03,257
but I knew I was alive.

507
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:10,764
There's nothing quite like
a couple of killers
with a shotgun at your head...

508
00:44:10,764 --> 00:44:12,766
to make you pay attention.

509
00:44:15,269 --> 00:44:19,273
But seeing
theing heads blown off
instead of mine,

510
00:44:19,273 --> 00:44:21,775
like toy targets exploding,

511
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:26,280
that's the part
that scared me the most.

512
00:44:38,292 --> 00:44:41,295
You can wash up
over here.

513
00:45:00,314 --> 00:45:02,316
Buenos dias.

514
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:05,452
Buenos dias.

515
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:23,971
I wanted to tell Paige...

516
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:26,974
"a couple
of killers changed me.

517
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,976
"They made your point.

518
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,980
And a bunch of gardeners
saved my life."

519
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:34,982
But something told me...

520
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,102
I might never get
the chance to tell her.

521
00:45:38,102 --> 00:45:40,104
Maybe what they say
is true.

522
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:44,108
You never can
go home again.

523
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,022
- Hey, filipe. Catch.
- Huh?

524
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,039
Gracias.

525
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:34,041
Silencio, por favor.

526
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:58,565
Mike.

527
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:05,572
- Amen.
- Amen.

528
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:08,075
Amen.

529
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:11,078
Ahora.

530
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:17,084
Mike, can you help me
with my homework tonight?

531
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,589
Come on.

532
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,591
Are you gonna come
fishing with us on sunday?

533
00:47:24,591 --> 00:47:26,593
It's our favorite thing
to do.

534
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,595
I like it too.

535
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm not turning over
his computer.

536
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,603
- Can you use it?
- No, I don't know how to use it.

537
00:47:36,603 --> 00:47:41,108
That's the last thing I want.
Then I'll come by
to pick it up, okay?

538
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,110
Don't push me.
You're trying
to be difficult.

539
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,612
I'm not trying
to be difficult.
I'm sorry.

540
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,614
But sooner or later,
you're gonna have to get
your head out of the sand...

541
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:50,617
and start dealing
with this.

542
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,619
Hang on, Paige.

543
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:57,624
Six just came up from
the recording studio.
He wants to tell you something.

544
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,127
Yo, madam Max.

545
00:48:00,127 --> 00:48:03,130
I'm supposed to tell you to
hand over the computer...

546
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,632
and cooperate
with the powers that be,

547
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:09,136
but you know that's
not exactly my style.

548
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:13,640
I say just take your
own sweet time, madam Max.

549
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:17,644
It's a cold world out here,
even in the sun.

550
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,148
You're a beautiful lady.

551
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,150
You stay warm.

552
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:25,152
Thanks, Six.

553
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:33,220
Well, yeah,
you can see down there
from here,

554
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,723
which means they could've
shot 'em from up here, yeah.

555
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:39,726
But they were headless corpses,
remember?

556
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:41,728
I don't think you can
blow heads off
from 300 yards.

557
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:45,732
- That's like three
football fields, right?
- All right.

558
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,734
The coroner said the recovered
skull fragments...

559
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,737
were in a state of critically
infarcted bifurcation,

560
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:53,740
meaning all the bone
was thoroughly shattered,

561
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,245
meaning the bullets
could have been high-density,
army-style splinter shot,

562
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:02,749
which can be fired
from three feet or 3,000 feet
with the same effect.

563
00:50:02,749 --> 00:50:04,751
See what I'm saying?

564
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,754
Get outta here.
You play too many
video games, kid.

565
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:11,758
You think maybe low-flying
F-16 fighters shot 'em, huh?

566
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:14,761
Like I said,
only in Hollywood.

567
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,763
Can't be coffee
and danish.

568
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:20,767
Has to be cappuccino
or that thick, creamy stuff,
that italian thing...

569
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,769
what is that?
Tiramisu.

570
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,771
- Tiramisu.
- Well, whatever.

571
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,274
Anyway,
this Michael Max,

572
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:30,277
he looks to me
like one of these guys that'd
have his own murder catered...

573
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,281
gentlemen, Michael Max
is a very innovative guy.

574
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,284
If he's gonna do something,
he's gonna do it first,

575
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,786
and he's gonna do it big,
he's gonna do it right.

576
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:42,789
That's exactly why somebody
probably wanted him dead.

577
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:47,294
I'd say someone
very professional,
obviously...

578
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,298
and very paranoid.

579
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,800
I don't exactly understand
what I just did for you.

580
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,804
It's okay. I'm just
trying to debug
a little number here.

581
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:00,807
So, uh...
so, thanks.

582
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,810
You're the wizard.

583
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,813
Well, I guess I'd better
head back to the shop.

584
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,316
Okay. See you.
See you.

585
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,096
Look. Two more.

586
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,600
They gotta be feds.
Still waiting
for me to come home.

587
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:51,108
Yeah?
Maybe you should
turn yourself in, eh?

588
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,610
You're wasting
my tax dollars, hombre.

589
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,729
Hey, hey.

590
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:20,387
Come through for me, baby.

591
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,889
Yes, baby.

592
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:26,393
Yes.
Come through for me.

593
00:52:26,893 --> 00:52:29,896
There they are.

594
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,899
Yes.

595
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:37,904
Fucking clouds.

596
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,909
Progress...

597
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,412
twenty seconds.

598
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:51,418
Oh, my god.

599
00:53:02,295 --> 00:53:04,798
Do you think
they're watching us?

600
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:07,300
What?

601
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,805
Do you think
they're watching us?

602
00:53:16,810 --> 00:53:19,312
It'll be all right,
hombre.
Yeah?

603
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,314
We'll feed you good.

604
00:53:21,314 --> 00:53:25,318
We'll feed youcocido,
menudo, carnitas, pozole.

605
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:29,322
Sounds good.

606
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,242
Wait.

607
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,249
Wait.

608
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,261
I never...

609
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:26,263
I never noticed.

610
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,830
Hey.

611
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,832
Two questions.

612
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:39,836
Are you here
to do something bad
with our father?

613
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:43,340
No.

614
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,345
Are you the guy
in the newspapers?

615
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:55,852
Yeah, I am.
But don't tell anybody.

616
00:55:56,853 --> 00:56:00,857
I told you.
Now pay up.

617
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,360
Yeah!

618
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,363
Some friend.
Sorry about that.

619
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:10,367
It's okay.
Good night.

620
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,369
Yeah.

621
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,371
Good night.

622
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:26,383
I still love my wife...

623
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:29,886
so much.

624
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,889
Senora, there are
three gentlemens.

625
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:34,891
Let them wait.

626
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,395
I always did,
even when I made her suffer,

627
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,898
on purpose,
for long periods of time,

628
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,401
and enjoyed it perversely.

629
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,413
"Perversely."

630
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:59,416
That's one thing
I think I can define now.

631
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:03,920
It's when things
are upside-down and you start
to like 'em that way.

632
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,925
Oh.

633
00:57:25,058 --> 00:57:27,060
Hey,
you got your phone?

634
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:38,571
You talk to him.

635
00:57:43,076 --> 00:57:45,078
Six. What's up?

636
00:57:45,078 --> 00:57:47,580
He's got to change.
You have to change.

637
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,583
What? Who this?

638
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,586
I'm a friend
who you don't know yet.

639
00:57:53,586 --> 00:57:55,588
Oh, shit.
I know all my friends.

640
00:57:55,588 --> 00:58:00,093
Oh, I'm an amigo,
closer than you think.

641
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:02,595
There's a message
I must give you.
There's no time.

642
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:05,098
You must change.
"Gangsta" rap is dying.

643
00:58:05,098 --> 00:58:07,100
What the fuck
are you talking about?

644
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,104
- Violence is dead.
- No, no, no, no, no.

645
00:58:11,104 --> 00:58:14,607
Let me tell you something,
friend. Violence is
bigger than ever.

646
00:58:14,607 --> 00:58:19,612
You see, little baby white girls
be piercing every floppy piece
of skin they got,

647
00:58:19,612 --> 00:58:22,115
creaming to every flavor
of gangsta.

648
00:58:22,115 --> 00:58:26,119
Pretty soon records
just gonna have the sound
of gunshots on 'em.

649
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:30,623
Everywhere you look,
billboards got some movie star
holding some big-ass gun.

650
00:58:30,623 --> 00:58:33,626
Let me tell you something,
motherfucker.

651
00:58:33,626 --> 00:58:37,130
Violence rules, man.
Violence is flip.

652
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:39,632
You don't like it,
run with the nuns,
but it is here,

653
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:41,634
it is now,
and Six is on it.

654
00:58:49,142 --> 00:58:51,144
Brian.

655
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:55,148
Hello, Paige.

656
00:58:59,152 --> 00:59:03,156
This is Terry Gromer, president,
music and movies divisions.

657
00:59:05,158 --> 00:59:08,661
And Ian Whitley,
your head of business affairs.

658
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:16,169
Hello, gentlemen.

659
00:59:20,173 --> 00:59:22,175
You can smoke, Brian.

660
00:59:24,677 --> 00:59:26,679
Thanks.

661
00:59:27,180 --> 00:59:29,682
Champagne? Coffee?

662
00:59:29,682 --> 00:59:33,686
I feel like
I've grown very close
to you in this short time.

663
00:59:40,193 --> 00:59:44,197
But now I'm about
to do something that
I think is important...

664
00:59:45,198 --> 00:59:47,200
but it is risky.

665
00:59:52,205 --> 00:59:54,207
Just in case
anything happens to me,

666
00:59:54,207 --> 00:59:58,711
I just wanted to say
thank you and adios.

667
00:59:58,711 --> 01:00:00,713
Que?
Que?

668
01:00:06,219 --> 01:00:08,221
Si, vamos!
"Vamos."

669
01:00:30,457 --> 01:00:33,460
- How you doing?
- Hi, ramon.
Take any station.

670
01:00:36,463 --> 01:00:39,466
Maybe it'll look better
with colored paper.
Yeah, I guess.

671
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:43,970
Hi.
Hi.

672
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:45,972
Do you have
any work station
that's available?

673
01:00:45,972 --> 01:00:48,975
Did you check in?
Got a friend
taking care of it.

674
01:00:48,975 --> 01:00:51,478
Great.
How about this one?

675
01:00:53,980 --> 01:00:56,483
Okay.

676
01:00:56,483 --> 01:00:59,486
Excuse me.
Can you help me?
Just a second.

677
01:00:59,486 --> 01:01:02,489
In a minute.
He's fine.
He can take care of himself.

678
01:01:27,013 --> 01:01:30,016
The thing about
sudden attack is...

679
01:01:30,016 --> 01:01:33,520
you never know
where it's coming from.

680
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,523
But it's usually not
from where you expect it,

681
01:01:36,523 --> 01:01:38,525
unless you expect it
from everywhere,

682
01:01:38,525 --> 01:01:41,027
which makes you paranoid.

683
01:01:48,034 --> 01:01:51,538
Mike, you'll probably
never get this.

684
01:01:51,538 --> 01:01:53,540
The FBI's
been all over everything.

685
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:57,544
But if you're out there...
this is very strange.

686
01:01:57,544 --> 01:02:01,548
A guy called you.
He wanted to talk
to you very urgently.

687
01:02:01,548 --> 01:02:06,052
He asked me whether you'd
had a chance to read the file
he sent you on e-mail.

688
01:02:06,553 --> 01:02:10,056
He sounded scared.
He didn't want to leave
his name or number.

689
01:02:10,056 --> 01:02:13,059
He insisted that
you would know
how to reach him.

690
01:02:13,059 --> 01:02:17,063
Apparently you met
at the technology fair
in florida last year.

691
01:02:17,063 --> 01:02:20,567
He said
you liked each other.

692
01:02:20,567 --> 01:02:26,072
I hope this means
something to you,
and I hope you're alive.

693
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:32,078
Ramon, jose.

694
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,082
Let's go.

695
01:02:49,095 --> 01:02:51,097
Let's just
get out of here.

696
01:02:52,599 --> 01:02:55,101
Okay, amigo.
Come on.

697
01:02:55,101 --> 01:02:58,104
- Out of the way, ma'am.
- What?

698
01:02:59,606 --> 01:03:02,609
Oh, shit.
Ramors got the keys.

699
01:03:02,609 --> 01:03:05,111
That's all the locks.

700
01:03:05,111 --> 01:03:07,614
Securing the back entrance?
Is that all you need?

701
01:03:10,116 --> 01:03:12,118
Gracias.

702
01:03:12,619 --> 01:03:14,120
Vamanos, vamanos, vamanos.

703
01:03:16,122 --> 01:03:18,625
Under control.

704
01:03:25,632 --> 01:03:27,634
All right,
let's get outta here.

705
01:03:34,140 --> 01:03:37,143
What are we looking for?
I don't know.

706
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:47,403
That was...
that was orion.

707
01:03:47,403 --> 01:03:49,906
This one is taurus.

708
01:03:51,407 --> 01:03:56,913
If you look really close,
you can see
the shape of a bull.

709
01:03:56,913 --> 01:04:00,416
Wow. Which one
did you go to?

710
01:04:00,416 --> 01:04:02,418
I didn't go
to the stars.

711
01:04:02,418 --> 01:04:05,421
I just helped build
one of these
big telescopes...

712
01:04:05,922 --> 01:04:07,924
so we can
see them better.

713
01:04:09,425 --> 01:04:11,427
My daddy's up there.

714
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:15,431
It'd be nice
if we could see him.

715
01:04:17,934 --> 01:04:20,937
But I guess
we can't always
have what we want.

716
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:07,043
Hey, Paige.
Hi, Six.

717
01:06:07,043 --> 01:06:09,545
Bad time?
No, I was just reading.

718
01:06:09,545 --> 01:06:12,548
I thought I heard something.
It gets kinda spooky
up here sometimes.

719
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:15,551
You seem tense.
Oh, no, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

720
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:19,055
I'll check on that
contract tomorrow.
You shouldn't be alone.

721
01:06:19,555 --> 01:06:22,058
No, I'm doing all right.

722
01:06:26,562 --> 01:06:29,065
Well, I'll see you
at the studio.

723
01:06:29,065 --> 01:06:31,067
Yeah, on thursday.

724
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:33,569
I'll see you
thursday evening.

725
01:06:33,569 --> 01:06:36,572
Right. Yeah.

726
01:06:39,575 --> 01:06:43,079
No, I like poetry.
Yeah.

727
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:46,082
I'm doing a lot of things
I've never done before.

728
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:50,086
I guess it's exciting,
yeah.

729
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:56,592
So I'll see you
thursday night.

730
01:09:02,101 --> 01:09:04,603
Pretty small.
Hmm.

731
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:07,106
Big memory though.

732
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:16,615
- A man I met once chose me
to reveal a secret to.
- Yeah?

733
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:23,122
He'd been working on
a government project.
I guess he...

734
01:09:23,122 --> 01:09:27,126
doesn't believe in it
anymore and needed
somebody on the outside.

735
01:09:29,628 --> 01:09:35,134
Why did he pick you?
Weren't you a big-shot
movie producer or something?

736
01:09:35,134 --> 01:09:37,636
I thought everybody
hated you guys.

737
01:09:39,138 --> 01:09:43,642
They do, but for some reason,
I guess... he liked me.

738
01:09:48,147 --> 01:09:50,149
Don't like us too much.

739
01:09:54,653 --> 01:09:56,655
I try not to.

740
01:09:59,158 --> 01:10:01,660
Good.

741
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:06,165
Just let us like you.
That's less dangerous.

742
01:10:06,165 --> 01:10:08,667
Hmm.
I hope so.

743
01:10:18,794 --> 01:10:22,798
You're doing great, Ray.
They're getting it all going.

744
01:10:25,301 --> 01:10:28,804
That, uh, maid
working out okay?

745
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:31,307
Yeah, fine.

746
01:10:32,308 --> 01:10:34,810
It's hard to get
good help
these days.

747
01:10:37,313 --> 01:10:39,815
Your part
should be done in
a couple of months.

748
01:10:39,815 --> 01:10:42,818
Then the operators
will take over.
That will be good.

749
01:10:45,321 --> 01:10:50,326
Just wanted to touch base,
tell you we're all
very happy with your work.

750
01:10:50,326 --> 01:10:52,828
Country's grateful
and all that.

751
01:10:59,335 --> 01:11:01,837
If we can
get this thing
fully operational soon...

752
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:04,340
it'll be
an awesome tool.

753
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,344
Cut down on
crime response time
by 200 percent.

754
01:11:08,344 --> 01:11:11,847
Accuracy,
eyewitness evidence.

755
01:11:12,848 --> 01:11:16,852
Could mean
the end of violence
as we know it.

756
01:11:16,852 --> 01:11:19,855
That would be good.

757
01:11:19,855 --> 01:11:25,361
Of course if there was
just one little, tiny,
infinitesimal leak...

758
01:11:25,361 --> 01:11:27,863
before congress
approved it,

759
01:11:27,863 --> 01:11:30,866
we'd have to wipe
the whole thing out.

760
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:34,870
Everything
down the drain.

761
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:36,872
Poof.

762
01:11:36,872 --> 01:11:38,874
Oh, they'd crucify
all of us.

763
01:11:40,876 --> 01:11:43,379
Not a perfect system.

764
01:11:43,379 --> 01:11:47,383
I've worked on projects
before that weren't popular
with the public.

765
01:11:51,387 --> 01:11:54,890
You're not in
nasa anymore, toto.

766
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,893
You're not watching
the heavens from earth.
That's easy.

767
01:11:59,895 --> 01:12:03,899
You're watching earth
from the heavens.
That's messier.

768
01:12:05,901 --> 01:12:09,905
A system like this,
there's the chance
for abuse.

769
01:12:15,911 --> 01:12:20,416
If you, uh, see anything
that I miss...

770
01:12:21,417 --> 01:12:23,419
any misuse,

771
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:27,923
anything, uh, strange...

772
01:12:27,923 --> 01:12:30,426
you'll let me know,
right?

773
01:12:30,926 --> 01:12:33,929
I'm a computer scientist.
This is Hollywood.

774
01:12:33,929 --> 01:12:36,432
What's not strange?

775
01:12:57,453 --> 01:13:00,456
Don't worry about
seeds of violence, Paige.

776
01:13:00,456 --> 01:13:03,459
The movie's a drain
on your cash flow anyway.

777
01:13:03,459 --> 01:13:07,963
It's the record company
that'll be your top asset with
the merger after the divorce.

778
01:13:07,963 --> 01:13:11,467
Hmm.
How do you divorce
a missing husband?

779
01:13:11,467 --> 01:13:14,470
Trust me.

780
01:13:16,472 --> 01:13:18,474
Hold on, Brian.

781
01:13:18,474 --> 01:13:21,977
- Go ahead, Claire.
- The production reports
are just about...

782
01:13:39,995 --> 01:13:41,997
okay, dad...
what's the matter?

783
01:13:43,999 --> 01:13:46,001
Now, is nothing
the matter?

784
01:13:48,003 --> 01:13:50,005
Dad, i, uh...

785
01:13:54,009 --> 01:13:58,013
- I have a problem, and, um...
- shoot.

786
01:14:00,516 --> 01:14:02,518
People are being killed.

787
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:08,023
I don't know, dad.

788
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:10,526
I don't even know if...

789
01:14:13,028 --> 01:14:15,030
I don't even know
if this place is safe.

790
01:14:15,531 --> 01:14:19,034
Can you be...
let out of anything?

791
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:26,542
We've got to get
to-together on that.

792
01:14:26,542 --> 01:14:29,545
Now, I think...

793
01:14:29,545 --> 01:14:32,047
it's a different
"doll" game.

794
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:36,051
Any-anything,
anything?

795
01:14:38,554 --> 01:14:41,557
You better hold on.

796
01:14:41,557 --> 01:14:44,059
All right.

797
01:14:44,059 --> 01:14:46,061
I will, dad.

798
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:54,203
I ain't never done this shit.

799
01:14:56,705 --> 01:14:58,207
I'm a rapper, so...

800
01:15:00,209 --> 01:15:02,211
I don't know.

801
01:15:03,712 --> 01:15:08,217
- This here is called
"when I close my eyes."
- Okay.

802
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:11,720
I'm gonna try
and lay it down for you...

803
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:16,225
like the black man
and not the gangster man do,

804
01:15:16,225 --> 01:15:19,728
because you ladies like
to watch your figure.

805
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:23,232
I'll take the fat out
and the sugar too.

806
01:15:27,236 --> 01:15:29,738
See, I'm talking about
a new sound.

807
01:15:32,241 --> 01:15:35,744
Somebody tell me just
the other day, like a...

808
01:15:35,744 --> 01:15:39,248
voice from heaven while
I'm riding down the freeway.

809
01:15:39,248 --> 01:15:42,751
He say that gangster sound
is dead and gone.

810
01:15:43,752 --> 01:15:46,255
He say that nasty groove
is something to prove,

811
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:48,757
that getting in your face
can leave an angry taste,

812
01:15:48,757 --> 01:15:51,260
get you up in arms
about the disgrace...

813
01:15:51,260 --> 01:15:53,262
and make you shake it
all over the place.

814
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:55,764
He say, that's been here,
and now it's gone.

815
01:15:55,764 --> 01:15:57,766
It's time for the wise
to move on.

816
01:15:58,267 --> 01:16:03,272
He talking about
some new kind of sound
with a different view.

817
01:16:03,272 --> 01:16:06,775
We used a hammer.
A golf club would do.

818
01:16:07,276 --> 01:16:10,279
He say machine-gun lyrics
just fire blanks.

819
01:16:10,779 --> 01:16:15,284
You're outta the trenches,
put on those
pink-checkered pants.

820
01:16:15,284 --> 01:16:19,788
He say don't matter
what you say, it's what
they see that win the day.

821
01:16:19,788 --> 01:16:22,291
He say change your name
from Six to Four,
you'll win the game,

822
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:25,794
gain much more.

823
01:16:25,794 --> 01:16:29,798
I'm talking about
some new kind of sound...

824
01:16:29,798 --> 01:16:32,301
that's so phat,

825
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:34,803
kinda cool in a suit
like some old hep cat.

826
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:41,810
But me? I don't know,
and I need it loud and proud,

827
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:44,313
not 'cause I need
to stick out the crowd,

828
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:46,315
it's 'cause
the sound of silence,

829
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:49,818
see, it makes me cry.

830
01:16:50,319 --> 01:16:54,323
Burns my ears
and spits blood in my eye.

831
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:58,327
'Cause it's not
the echo of the shots
still ringing in my head...

832
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:02,831
or the line on page three
saying some other
black man dead.

833
01:17:02,831 --> 01:17:07,336
For me, when I close my eyes,
I only hear one sound.

834
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,843
The sound of my brother ashe
when he hit that ground.

835
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,365
I sure admire the way
you guys have jumped back
in the saddle here.

836
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:38,867
Some people'd be in hawaii
under protection.

837
01:17:38,867 --> 01:17:41,370
Police protection
gives me the shivers.

838
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,372
I know what you mean.

839
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:46,875
In the movies,
it always turns out that
there's a leak on the force,

840
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:49,378
or the guard
just went for a piss
when the killer comes.

841
01:17:49,378 --> 01:17:54,383
I hate that stuff.
You guys are way more original.

842
01:17:54,383 --> 01:17:58,387
- I got eyes
in the back of my head.
- My god, she is something.

843
01:17:58,387 --> 01:18:00,889
I don't know how you keep
your mind on your work.

844
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:04,893
Listen, detective Doc,

845
01:18:04,893 --> 01:18:07,396
the investigation
is basically over.

846
01:18:07,396 --> 01:18:11,900
Mike is not
a suspect anymore.
He's a missing person.

847
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:17,406
You're the only one
who's trying to figure out
the big, hidden story.

848
01:18:17,406 --> 01:18:21,410
If there is a connection
between the movie
and Mike's case,

849
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:24,413
I think the link
is in your head.

850
01:18:24,413 --> 01:18:28,417
Have a nice day,
detective Doc.

851
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:33,422
Boom is in the shot.

852
01:18:33,422 --> 01:18:37,426
Look, Claire,
this is impossible.

853
01:18:37,426 --> 01:18:40,929
You cannot just
waltz in here with anybody.
I know. I'm sorry.

854
01:18:40,929 --> 01:18:42,931
It won't happen again.

855
01:18:44,433 --> 01:18:48,437
The guard just went for a piss
before the killer comes in.

856
01:18:48,437 --> 01:18:54,443
I mean, why do I
make films in America?
I should've stayed in Europe.

857
01:18:56,445 --> 01:18:59,448
All right,
there's a one-hour break.
We'll shoot it after dinner.

858
01:18:59,448 --> 01:19:01,950
Anyway,
let's take a break.

859
01:19:01,950 --> 01:19:03,952
Okay, I'll see you.

860
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,963
You got the part.
Yep. Did you
find your man?

861
01:19:15,464 --> 01:19:17,966
Nope.
Hmm. What about
your woman?

862
01:19:21,470 --> 01:19:23,472
Now, I remember
the first line.

863
01:19:24,973 --> 01:19:28,977
What happens next?
Well, see, I overheard this guy...

864
01:19:28,977 --> 01:19:30,979
before he killed
my sister,

865
01:19:30,979 --> 01:19:33,982
and the last thing
she said was,
"how did you find me?"

866
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:37,486
And he says,
"I've got eyes
in the back of my head."

867
01:19:37,486 --> 01:19:41,490
Now, that guy,
he works here.

868
01:19:41,490 --> 01:19:44,493
So I decide to come pay him
a little visit.

869
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:50,499
Hmm.
Sex, murder, revenge.

870
01:19:50,499 --> 01:19:55,504
- Old-fashioned american fun.
- Hey, whatever brings
people together.

871
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:58,006
You never know.

872
01:20:43,802 --> 01:20:48,807
# When we make love
you know we're making love #

873
01:20:49,808 --> 01:20:51,810
# to everyone #

874
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:56,314
# we've ever made love to #

875
01:20:57,816 --> 01:21:03,321
# so when you take him
down inside #

876
01:21:04,823 --> 01:21:09,828
# just know I'm there
with you #

877
01:21:10,829 --> 01:21:15,333
# and you may
feel me crying #

878
01:21:16,835 --> 01:21:19,838
# and, oh, I hope you do #

879
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:23,341
# I'm out there somewhere
all alone #

880
01:21:24,342 --> 01:21:26,845
# with memories of you #

881
01:21:28,847 --> 01:21:33,218
# and you may
feel me crying #

882
01:21:42,861 --> 01:21:45,864
uh, this one is...
a little silly.

883
01:21:45,864 --> 01:21:49,367
It's called
"I'm a fluff ball."

884
01:21:49,367 --> 01:21:53,371
"I'm a fluff ball,
living my fluffy life
in scarcity.

885
01:21:53,371 --> 01:21:57,375
The life I choose
is an illusion.
The world is an intrusion."

886
01:21:58,877 --> 01:22:00,879
- What's your name?
- Ruby.

887
01:22:01,379 --> 01:22:05,383
I'm Ruby,
and I want to fuck you.

888
01:22:05,383 --> 01:22:08,887
Well,
that's honest.

889
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:11,890
And coincidentally,
I want to
fuck you too.

890
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:15,393
No, no, I mean,
I want to fuck you.
I want to fuck you.

891
01:22:15,393 --> 01:22:18,396
Hey, you get that
special feeling.

892
01:22:18,530 --> 01:22:24,035
I don't think you understand
exactly who's going to be
doing the fucking here.

893
01:22:27,038 --> 01:22:30,542
Yeah, right.
No, no, it's in here.

894
01:22:31,042 --> 01:22:34,546
You're kidding.
Show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

895
01:22:34,546 --> 01:22:37,549
Listen, baby,
I got a better...
forget it.

896
01:22:37,549 --> 01:22:40,051
My way or no way.
What is this?

897
01:22:40,051 --> 01:22:43,555
The ultimate
good news/bad news
situation?

898
01:22:43,555 --> 01:22:47,559
See ya.
Hold on.
This takes a minute.

899
01:22:47,559 --> 01:22:49,561
Jesus.

900
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:52,063
- You remind me of someone.
- Witty.

901
01:22:52,063 --> 01:22:56,067
Okay, all right,
whatever you want.

902
01:22:58,069 --> 01:23:01,072
Good, I'll have
a cream soda.
I'll have a cream soda.

903
01:23:01,072 --> 01:23:04,075
Doesn't a sweet thing
like you worry about
getting hurt?

904
01:23:04,075 --> 01:23:06,578
There's a lot
of bad boys
out there.

905
01:23:06,578 --> 01:23:08,580
Mm-hmm. I know.

906
01:23:09,581 --> 01:23:12,083
But I've got eyes
in the back of my head.

907
01:23:15,086 --> 01:23:18,590
And cut!
Excellent, Cat.

908
01:23:18,590 --> 01:23:22,594
That's a print.
Wire them for the bullets
and lots of blood.

909
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:25,096
Nice work!

910
01:23:25,597 --> 01:23:27,599
Good going!

911
01:23:32,103 --> 01:23:36,107
Great. Great scene, Zoltan.
It was great.
Mm-hmm.

912
01:23:36,107 --> 01:23:40,612
Thank you, Brian.
But you're not here to
make compliments, right?

913
01:23:43,114 --> 01:23:46,618
Listen, uh,
I've done all I can do,
all right?

914
01:23:46,618 --> 01:23:49,120
They pulled the money.
That's it.

915
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,122
I'm sorry.

916
01:23:53,124 --> 01:23:57,629
Liar. I know who pulled
the money. You don't waste
much time, do you, Brian?

917
01:23:58,129 --> 01:24:01,132
That's it, Cat.
They're shutting the movie down.

918
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:08,139
That's it? It's just...
it's-it's over?

919
01:24:09,641 --> 01:24:11,643
I'm sorry.

920
01:24:20,151 --> 01:24:22,654
I guess that's a wrap.

921
01:24:30,662 --> 01:24:32,664
I'll just be a minute.

922
01:24:34,165 --> 01:24:36,167
I'm sorry.
You were good.

923
01:24:36,668 --> 01:24:38,169
You'll get
another break.

924
01:24:38,670 --> 01:24:41,172
Define "break."

925
01:25:12,203 --> 01:25:16,207
I guess sometimes your friends
are really your enemies.

926
01:25:16,207 --> 01:25:19,210
Sometimes your enemies
are your friends.

927
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:22,213
Sometimes they're one
and the same.

928
01:25:22,213 --> 01:25:25,216
Who can you trust?

929
01:25:25,216 --> 01:25:28,720
It reminds me
of what a prick I was.

930
01:25:28,720 --> 01:25:32,223
I'm starting to think
that fairy tales are overrated.

931
01:25:32,223 --> 01:25:36,728
Sometimes a good old-fashioned
catastrophe can really cut
to the heart of the matter.

932
01:25:36,728 --> 01:25:39,230
Ready or not.

933
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:43,234
Yeah, well,
I can feel it
cutting right now.

934
01:25:43,234 --> 01:25:45,236
I'll just go.

935
01:25:48,740 --> 01:25:51,242
Try and make
the most of it.

936
01:25:54,245 --> 01:25:56,748
Whew.

937
01:25:56,748 --> 01:25:58,750
Shit.

938
01:26:01,252 --> 01:26:03,254
Huh.

939
01:26:10,261 --> 01:26:13,264
Hey!

940
01:26:16,768 --> 01:26:19,270
# My heart #

941
01:26:19,270 --> 01:26:22,273
# animals on wheels #

942
01:26:22,273 --> 01:26:27,779
# faster, faster
animals on wheels #

943
01:26:27,779 --> 01:26:32,283
# faster all the time #

944
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:51,920
you sure you didn't
break something?
No, it's okay.

945
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:53,922
Don't worry, I won't sue.

946
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:59,427
Well, I gotta say,
you know how
to tell a story.

947
01:27:00,929 --> 01:27:04,432
It must all seem
completely bizarre to you.

948
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:07,435
Just a little.
And if it's all true,

949
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:10,438
you're gonna have
to trust someone.

950
01:27:10,939 --> 01:27:13,942
You know, I hate it
in movies when the guy
running from the government...

951
01:27:14,442 --> 01:27:17,445
meets a well-intentioned,
beautiful girl,

952
01:27:17,946 --> 01:27:20,448
gives her
top-secret information.

953
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:24,452
That character,
she always dies.

954
01:27:24,953 --> 01:27:28,456
Look, just because some
real FBI guy believes
in movies so much...

955
01:27:28,456 --> 01:27:30,458
doesn't mean
you have to.

956
01:27:30,959 --> 01:27:33,461
He doesn't know any better.
You should.

957
01:27:33,962 --> 01:27:36,965
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not exactly
the stupid actress...

958
01:27:36,965 --> 01:27:39,968
who stands at
the edge of the cliff
screaming for help.

959
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:42,470
No.

960
01:27:42,470 --> 01:27:45,974
You're the stupid stuntwoman
who jumps off the cliff.

961
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:48,977
This is a lot more dangerous
than the cliff.

962
01:27:51,980 --> 01:27:53,481
Define "dangerous."

963
01:27:53,982 --> 01:27:56,484
It comes up fast...

964
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,988
and...

965
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:04,993
you see those two guys
over there?

966
01:28:04,993 --> 01:28:08,496
If I went for a piss,
they would eat you alive.

967
01:28:08,496 --> 01:28:10,498
Those two guys?

968
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,501
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey!

969
01:28:14,002 --> 01:28:16,004
# On the town #

970
01:28:17,005 --> 01:28:20,508
# with a little drop
of poison #

971
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:25,513
# nobody knows #

972
01:28:25,513 --> 01:28:29,517
# they're lining up
to go insane #

973
01:28:31,519 --> 01:28:34,022
# I'm all alone #

974
01:28:35,523 --> 01:28:40,028
# I smoke my friends
down to the filter #

975
01:28:43,031 --> 01:28:48,036
# but I feel much cleaner
after it rains #

976
01:28:48,536 --> 01:28:50,538
yeah.

977
01:28:50,538 --> 01:28:55,043
# She left in the fall
that's her picture
on the wall #

978
01:28:55,043 --> 01:28:58,046
# she always had
that little drop #

979
01:28:58,046 --> 01:29:00,548
# of poison #

980
01:29:06,554 --> 01:29:08,556
hey, where you going, honey?
Party just started.

981
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:13,061
# She left in the fall
that's her picture
on the wall #

982
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:17,065
# she always had
that little drop of poison #

983
01:29:17,065 --> 01:29:19,067
hey, easy.

984
01:29:19,067 --> 01:29:23,571
Guys, can we do
a little negotiation here?

985
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:26,074
Ow!

986
01:29:26,074 --> 01:29:28,576
Fight!

987
01:29:29,077 --> 01:29:31,079
I'm sorry.

988
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:35,583
I don't know.

989
01:29:35,583 --> 01:29:38,086
Nobody ever gave me
a break before.

990
01:29:41,089 --> 01:29:43,591
I guess I didn't want
to let you down.

991
01:30:04,612 --> 01:30:09,117
This is the name
and the number.
Don't use it yourself.

992
01:30:09,117 --> 01:30:13,121
Wait until you find
somebody capable
you can absolutely trust.

993
01:30:17,125 --> 01:30:19,127
Like I trust you.

994
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:44,652
You've been through
a lot lately. Why don't
you lie low for a while?

995
01:30:46,654 --> 01:30:49,657
You know, Doc,
I've known guys like you
over the years.

996
01:30:49,657 --> 01:30:51,659
Sharp, tenacious,

997
01:30:51,659 --> 01:30:53,661
real prize winners,

998
01:30:53,661 --> 01:30:58,166
generally obsessed
over the dangerous cases
you've been taken off of.

999
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:01,669
Truth is,
there's usually some kind
of personal motive.

1000
01:31:01,669 --> 01:31:06,174
Some hook in the gut.
Is that what's going on
with you, Doc?

1001
01:31:08,176 --> 01:31:10,678
What's going on with me
is that you're trying
to infect me...

1002
01:31:10,678 --> 01:31:15,683
with your
good old-fashioned cynicism,
so I doubt myself and decide...

1003
01:31:15,683 --> 01:31:18,686
that we're really not trying
to cover up some...

1004
01:31:18,686 --> 01:31:21,189
covert, totally illegal,
murderous operation.

1005
01:31:21,189 --> 01:31:23,691
Listen, you just
watch your step.

1006
01:31:24,192 --> 01:31:28,196
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I think we found Cat.

1007
01:31:28,196 --> 01:31:32,200
We ran a trace on a letter
to her brother in seattle
on his birthday.

1008
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,703
It's from south central.
We're verifying
the address right now.

1009
01:31:35,703 --> 01:31:37,705
Thank you.

1010
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:03,364
Hi there.
Can you tell me
where number 14 is?

1011
01:32:03,364 --> 01:32:05,366
Up there.
Thank you.

1012
01:32:16,377 --> 01:32:18,880
A cop!
A cop!
Let's go in the car.

1013
01:32:20,882 --> 01:32:23,885
I'm Doc.
I'm here to see Cat.

1014
01:32:23,885 --> 01:32:26,888
You must be Ade.
Hmm.

1015
01:32:26,888 --> 01:32:29,390
So, you here as a cop
or as a human being?

1016
01:32:29,390 --> 01:32:32,393
Umm...
human cop possible?

1017
01:32:32,393 --> 01:32:34,395
Hmm.

1018
01:32:34,395 --> 01:32:36,397
Flying camel possible?

1019
01:32:38,900 --> 01:32:42,403
Seen 'em.
Rare but beautiful.

1020
01:32:44,405 --> 01:32:48,409
Okay, I am here
as a human being.

1021
01:32:49,911 --> 01:32:51,913
Welcome.

1022
01:32:56,417 --> 01:32:58,419
Cat's told me
all about you.

1023
01:32:59,420 --> 01:33:01,923
The Doc's here
on a social call,
blanche.

1024
01:33:02,924 --> 01:33:05,927
It's okay.

1025
01:33:10,932 --> 01:33:15,436
I realized after,
uh... after they tried
to close the case...

1026
01:33:15,436 --> 01:33:21,442
and stop me from digging,
even on my own time,
that, uh...

1027
01:33:22,443 --> 01:33:24,946
this instinct
I had about you...

1028
01:33:24,946 --> 01:33:28,449
that you had some
valuable information,

1029
01:33:28,449 --> 01:33:33,454
some key to the whole puzzle
and that I had to see you...
was...

1030
01:33:33,454 --> 01:33:37,458
based on nothing
except that...

1031
01:33:37,959 --> 01:33:39,961
I wanted to see you.

1032
01:33:40,962 --> 01:33:43,965
I wanted to see you
more than anything.

1033
01:33:45,967 --> 01:33:48,970
- Really?
- Truly.

1034
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,973
Took you a while
to find me.

1035
01:33:52,473 --> 01:33:54,475
You were
pretty well-hidden.

1036
01:33:56,978 --> 01:33:58,980
It's nice to see you.

1037
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:01,983
It's nice to see you.

1038
01:34:06,487 --> 01:34:11,492
I thought that, um,
maybe you came by because you'd heard...

1039
01:34:11,492 --> 01:34:13,995
you'd heard
that I'd met with Mike.

1040
01:34:13,995 --> 01:34:17,498
What? You saw Mike?

1041
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:23,004
Since he disappeared?
Briefly.
We had a few beers.

1042
01:34:23,004 --> 01:34:27,008
You had a few beers
with Mike?
Are you kidding?

1043
01:34:27,508 --> 01:34:30,511
What happened?
What did he say?
Hey, flashback.

1044
01:34:30,511 --> 01:34:32,513
Remember, we have
an agreement.

1045
01:34:32,513 --> 01:34:36,517
You are on a special visa,
or you can fly your camel ass
outta here. Okay?

1046
01:34:36,517 --> 01:34:39,020
He's a missing person,
and this is
a double murder case.

1047
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:42,023
That's just the tip
of the iceberg.
All right.

1048
01:35:04,545 --> 01:35:07,548
By the way,

1049
01:35:07,548 --> 01:35:09,550
I love you.

1050
01:35:41,198 --> 01:35:43,200
They missed him.

1051
01:36:12,863 --> 01:36:16,367
I'm, uh, just going
for something to eat,
guys.

1052
01:37:33,594 --> 01:37:35,596
Come out.

1053
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,103
I could've killed you.

1054
01:37:44,105 --> 01:37:46,107
I've been considering that.

1055
01:37:46,107 --> 01:37:50,111
Yeah, me too.
I've been considering a lot.

1056
01:37:55,116 --> 01:37:57,618
I've been watching you.

1057
01:37:57,618 --> 01:38:00,621
I think you've been doing
more than considering.

1058
01:38:06,627 --> 01:38:09,130
You were here,
weren't you?

1059
01:38:11,132 --> 01:38:13,134
You were here before.

1060
01:38:16,137 --> 01:38:18,139
You took your organizer.

1061
01:38:19,140 --> 01:38:23,144
I could feel you,
just like I felt you now.

1062
01:38:24,645 --> 01:38:27,648
You came right in,
but you didn't say anything.

1063
01:38:27,648 --> 01:38:30,151
You let me wonder.

1064
01:38:31,152 --> 01:38:34,155
You haven't communicated once
in two months...

1065
01:38:34,655 --> 01:38:37,658
not a call, not a message.

1066
01:38:38,659 --> 01:38:40,661
I could feel you
punishing me.

1067
01:38:42,163 --> 01:38:44,165
It hurt.

1068
01:38:45,666 --> 01:38:47,668
I couldn't communicate
with you.

1069
01:38:47,668 --> 01:38:52,173
It was too dangerous
for both of us.
For both of us?

1070
01:38:52,173 --> 01:38:57,178
A guy slipped me a
government file, an FBI file.
Now they're trying to kill me.

1071
01:38:57,178 --> 01:39:00,181
Did you kill
those two guys?
No, I didn't.

1072
01:39:00,181 --> 01:39:02,183
I could kill you
right now.

1073
01:39:16,697 --> 01:39:19,700
Somebody tell me
just the other day,
like a voice...

1074
01:39:24,705 --> 01:39:26,707
# somebody tell me
just the other day #

1075
01:39:26,707 --> 01:39:29,710
# like a voice from heaven
while I'm riding
on the freeway #

1076
01:39:32,713 --> 01:39:34,215
look.

1077
01:39:34,715 --> 01:39:38,719
All I can think of while
they had the gun to my head
was how much I loved you.

1078
01:39:40,221 --> 01:39:42,223
I think it saved me.

1079
01:39:43,224 --> 01:39:46,227
I pictured you...

1080
01:39:46,227 --> 01:39:48,729
starting over again...

1081
01:39:48,729 --> 01:39:51,732
but starting over
in a better way.

1082
01:39:53,234 --> 01:39:55,736
I guess guatemala
is out of the question.

1083
01:39:55,736 --> 01:39:58,739
I'm not kidding around.
Everybody thinks
you're dead...

1084
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:01,242
or a murderer,
a fugitive.

1085
01:40:01,242 --> 01:40:05,246
I can't turn myself in.
Don't you see?

1086
01:40:05,246 --> 01:40:08,249
Who can I
turn myself in to?
Good question.

1087
01:40:08,249 --> 01:40:12,753
I see who you've
turned yourself into.
Kinda like looking in a mirror.

1088
01:40:13,254 --> 01:40:15,256
No.
It's me, Paige.

1089
01:40:16,757 --> 01:40:19,760
It doesn't matter.
You're an intruder
in the middle of the night.

1090
01:40:20,261 --> 01:40:22,263
I'd have every right
to kill you,
every right.

1091
01:40:23,764 --> 01:40:27,768
It's nice to see you
so motivated.
People change.

1092
01:40:30,771 --> 01:40:34,775
Maybe.
It feels good to be
appreciated sometimes,

1093
01:40:34,775 --> 01:40:37,278
to have someone
support you emotionally,

1094
01:40:37,278 --> 01:40:40,781
to have someone
who gives a shit about
who you really are inside.

1095
01:40:40,781 --> 01:40:42,783
Say, baby.

1096
01:40:42,783 --> 01:40:45,786
Baby, you down there?

1097
01:40:46,787 --> 01:40:49,790
I'm coming.
You want some water?

1098
01:40:49,790 --> 01:40:52,293
I want you, baby.

1099
01:40:52,293 --> 01:40:54,795
You got it.

1100
01:41:08,309 --> 01:41:11,812
I keep the company
and the house.

1101
01:41:11,812 --> 01:41:15,816
When everything's settled,
I'll send you
half the cash.

1102
01:41:17,318 --> 01:41:20,821
You would've never let me
have half. You would've
wiggled out of it.

1103
01:41:20,821 --> 01:41:22,823
You bastards always do.

1104
01:41:24,825 --> 01:41:29,330
If there's anything
specific you want,
you let me know now.

1105
01:41:44,345 --> 01:41:46,347
The robe.

1106
01:41:46,347 --> 01:41:50,851
- What?
- I want your robe.

1107
01:41:52,853 --> 01:41:56,357
If you think I'm gonna...

1108
01:41:56,357 --> 01:42:00,361
it's just a robe.
Hmm? That's all I want.

1109
01:42:02,863 --> 01:42:06,367
- Then you'll leave?
- Mm-hmm.

1110
01:42:07,868 --> 01:42:11,872
- That's the deal.
- Half the cash later.

1111
01:42:13,874 --> 01:42:16,377
The robe now.

1112
01:42:16,877 --> 01:42:20,881
Say, baby,
you all right?
Yeah!

1113
01:42:20,881 --> 01:42:25,886
I'm coming!
Oh, could you
put some music on?

1114
01:42:35,896 --> 01:42:39,900
Half my kingdom for a robe.
It's a pretty good deal...

1115
01:42:41,402 --> 01:42:43,404
even in Hollywood.

1116
01:43:02,423 --> 01:43:04,925
Mmm.

1117
01:43:06,927 --> 01:43:11,432
First time I've seen it
with a woman with a gun
who takes her clothes off.

1118
01:43:12,433 --> 01:43:14,435
I like it.

1119
01:43:14,435 --> 01:43:16,437
Now everybody has
what they want.

1120
01:43:28,949 --> 01:43:31,452
Is it won'th dying for?

1121
01:43:31,452 --> 01:43:33,454
It always was.

1122
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,962
Ramon gomez.

1123
01:43:43,464 --> 01:43:46,967
Whatever you were
gonna give to me,
give to him.

1124
01:43:48,969 --> 01:43:50,971
If you're gonna
run a company...

1125
01:43:51,972 --> 01:43:53,974
trust your instincts.

1126
01:43:53,974 --> 01:43:56,477
You got what it takes.

1127
01:44:04,485 --> 01:44:07,488
Be careful with those things.
They can be dangerous...

1128
01:44:07,988 --> 01:44:10,491
if you can get 'em to work.

1129
01:44:16,997 --> 01:44:19,500
Paige! What happened?

1130
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:22,002
Paige! Answer me!

1131
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:38,986
I don't know how
you work on that junk,
that antiquated typewriter.

1132
01:44:38,986 --> 01:44:43,490
You gotta change to a computer.
I can hook it up for you.
No, no!

1133
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:46,994
I think the idea
of this is right.

1134
01:44:47,494 --> 01:44:49,496
Yeah?
Not your computer.

1135
01:44:49,496 --> 01:44:51,999
Not the computer?
Oh, no, no, no.

1136
01:44:51,999 --> 01:44:54,001
Umm...

1137
01:44:54,001 --> 01:44:58,005
well, an old man...
is an old man.

1138
01:44:58,005 --> 01:45:03,010
I have nothing to...
to lose except that...

1139
01:45:03,510 --> 01:45:06,513
as long as you
remain with me.

1140
01:45:19,143 --> 01:45:22,646
Stop sliding around
with your gun like some
paranoid drug lord.

1141
01:45:22,646 --> 01:45:26,650
If somebody wanted to get you,
they'd probably just blow up
your little house.

1142
01:45:28,152 --> 01:45:31,155
Cat?

1143
01:45:31,155 --> 01:45:35,159
I'm the one asking
the questions here.

1144
01:45:45,169 --> 01:45:47,671
What are you
doing here?

1145
01:45:48,172 --> 01:45:50,174
Depends.

1146
01:45:54,178 --> 01:45:56,180
On what?

1147
01:45:57,681 --> 01:45:59,683
Define that thing
you said.

1148
01:46:09,193 --> 01:46:12,196
Define it.

1149
01:46:12,696 --> 01:46:16,200
I can't believe you're here.
Don't change the subject.

1150
01:46:26,710 --> 01:46:28,712
Define it.

1151
01:46:31,715 --> 01:46:33,717
Mmm!

1152
01:46:39,223 --> 01:46:41,225
Be more specific.

1153
01:46:42,726 --> 01:46:46,230
# I was wounded #

1154
01:47:17,144 --> 01:47:20,647
kcrw, a community service
of santa monica college...

1155
01:47:20,647 --> 01:47:22,649
and national public radio.

1156
01:48:58,245 --> 01:49:02,749
# She tucks me in
and then she screams #

1157
01:49:04,251 --> 01:49:09,373
# one day you will
have to choose #

1158
01:50:01,425 --> 01:50:05,429
what a city.
Nothing like it.

1159
01:50:05,429 --> 01:50:07,931
If we could see it.

1160
01:50:13,937 --> 01:50:16,440
Are you Doc?
Yeah.

1161
01:50:18,942 --> 01:50:21,445
So, you, uh...
uuh!

1162
01:50:29,453 --> 01:50:31,455
Oh!

1163
01:50:32,956 --> 01:50:34,958
Come here!

1164
01:50:34,958 --> 01:50:37,961
Don't move, don't move.
My god, they could
shoot anybody.

1165
01:51:00,984 --> 01:51:04,988
Come on, kids, come on.

1166
01:51:26,009 --> 01:51:28,011
Mommy.

1167
01:51:36,520 --> 01:51:39,022
I'll spare you
the speech.

1168
01:51:39,022 --> 01:51:42,025
3,500 murders
last year.

1169
01:51:44,027 --> 01:51:47,531
Anything that helps you
see the truth is good.

1170
01:51:47,531 --> 01:51:49,533
Ray is the traitor.

1171
01:52:21,314 --> 01:52:26,953
Ray dug his own grave.
You don't change your mind
on the battlefield.

1172
01:52:26,953 --> 01:52:28,955
At least I knew
you wouldn't.

1173
01:52:28,955 --> 01:52:32,959
They said, get us someone
who'll risk her life.

1174
01:52:32,959 --> 01:52:36,963
I said,
I'll get you somebody
who owes us her life,

1175
01:52:36,963 --> 01:52:39,966
who owes us
for her salvation,

1176
01:52:39,966 --> 01:52:43,970
a woman whose husband was killed
in front of her eyes.

1177
01:52:44,471 --> 01:52:46,973
I don't know why I'm trying
to cheer you up.

1178
01:52:46,973 --> 01:52:50,477
I'm the one who had to shut down
this whole operation.

1179
01:52:52,479 --> 01:52:54,481
We were trying to do
something good.

1180
01:52:54,481 --> 01:52:57,484
Ray was trying
to do something good.

1181
01:52:57,484 --> 01:52:59,486
Ray was doing
something stupid.

1182
01:53:00,987 --> 01:53:03,490
You're good, mathilda.

1183
01:53:05,492 --> 01:53:07,994
People with good intentions
aren't enough.

1184
01:53:11,998 --> 01:53:14,000
Changing things takes guts.

1185
01:53:15,502 --> 01:53:19,506
Changing yourself...
that takes guts.

1186
01:53:28,515 --> 01:53:32,018
Listen to us.
A couple of killers...

1187
01:53:32,018 --> 01:53:35,021
trying to change the world.

1188
01:53:40,527 --> 01:53:42,529
I'm finished.

1189
01:53:44,030 --> 01:53:46,032
I've paid you back.

1190
01:53:47,033 --> 01:53:49,536
We are even now.

1191
01:53:49,536 --> 01:53:52,539
I'm gonna
take my daughter...

1192
01:53:52,539 --> 01:53:54,541
and start my life over.

1193
01:53:56,042 --> 01:53:59,546
And if you think
that you still own me...

1194
01:54:02,048 --> 01:54:04,551
then you can shoot me
in the back.

1195
01:54:17,063 --> 01:54:19,065
Mathilda!

1196
01:54:35,081 --> 01:54:37,584
Habla espanol?

1197
01:54:38,585 --> 01:54:40,587
Poco.

1198
01:54:40,587 --> 01:54:44,591
- How poco?
- Very poco.

1199
01:54:48,845 --> 01:54:50,847
Why don't you
teach me some?

1200
01:54:52,849 --> 01:54:54,851
Uhh...

1201
01:54:54,851 --> 01:54:57,854
madre.
Mm-hmm.

1202
01:54:59,856 --> 01:55:03,359
- Los angeles.
- Los angeles.

1203
01:55:03,359 --> 01:55:05,862
Los angeles.

1204
01:55:09,365 --> 01:55:12,869
- Sky.
- Cielo.

1205
01:55:12,869 --> 01:55:14,871
I thoughtcielo
meant heaven.

1206
01:55:15,371 --> 01:55:17,373
Cielomeans
both heaven and sky.

1207
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:30,386
They're watching us.

1208
01:55:32,889 --> 01:55:34,390
Mommy!

1209
01:55:34,891 --> 01:55:37,393
Don't get too close
to the edge.

1210
01:55:59,916 --> 01:56:04,921
Funny. Just when you think
you've got it all figured,

1211
01:56:04,921 --> 01:56:07,423
in a heartbeat
it changes again.

1212
01:56:10,426 --> 01:56:12,428
Thing is,

1213
01:56:12,428 --> 01:56:17,433
all those years
while I was waiting
for that sudden attack,

1214
01:56:17,433 --> 01:56:20,436
I became the enemy.

1215
01:56:20,436 --> 01:56:24,440
And when the enemy I'd expected
finally came,

1216
01:56:24,440 --> 01:56:26,943
they set me free.

1217
01:56:30,446 --> 01:56:32,949
It's strange, hmm?

1218
01:56:47,080 --> 01:56:50,083
Now, when I look over
the ocean...

1219
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:56,589
I don't expect
nuclear submarines
or alien attackers anymore.

1220
01:56:57,590 --> 01:57:00,093
I can see china now,

1221
01:57:01,094 --> 01:57:03,596
and I hope they can see us.

1222
01:57:42,518 --> 01:57:45,521
# It's a beautiful day today #

1223
01:57:45,521 --> 01:57:48,524
# everything is going my way #

1224
01:57:48,524 --> 01:57:51,027
# even the words
doing what I say #

1225
01:57:51,027 --> 01:57:54,030
# oh, babe
got to get away #

1226
01:57:54,030 --> 01:57:56,532
# to be impossible #

1227
01:57:56,532 --> 01:57:59,535
# isn't that difficult #

1228
01:57:59,535 --> 01:58:02,038
# in the city you're invisible #

1229
01:58:02,038 --> 01:58:05,541
# when you come from
a small town #

1230
01:58:05,541 --> 01:58:08,161
# everything is all right #

1231
01:58:08,161 --> 01:58:10,163
# everything is all right #

1232
01:58:10,163 --> 01:58:12,665
# I'm not your baby #

1233
01:58:13,166 --> 01:58:16,169
# please #

1234
01:58:16,169 --> 01:58:18,671
# tourist in a traffic jam #

1235
01:58:18,671 --> 01:58:21,674
# baby sham and handy cam #

1236
01:58:21,674 --> 01:58:24,177
# I'm not your mother

1237
01:58:24,677 --> 01:58:26,679
# I'm not your baby #

1238
01:58:26,679 --> 01:58:29,682
# don't treat me
like I'm a trick #

1239
01:58:29,682 --> 01:58:32,185
# I won't treat you
like you're a prick #

1240
01:58:32,185 --> 01:58:35,188
# don't need no doctor
I'm not ill #

1241
01:58:35,188 --> 01:58:38,691
# I'm not your baby #

1242
01:58:38,691 --> 01:58:41,194
# everything is all right #

1243
01:58:41,194 --> 01:58:43,696
# everything is all right #

# I'm not your baby #

1245
01:58:46,199 --> 01:58:50,703
# please #

1246

# cut out the poetry #

1247
01:59:14,227 --> 01:59:16,729
# let's hit the main artery #

1248
01:59:16,729 --> 01:59:19,732
# no time for a "tourniquey" #

1249
01:59:19,732 --> 01:59:22,235
# the colors all run out on me #

1250
01:59:22,235 --> 01:59:25,238
# you brought me
all kinds of goods #

1251
01:59:25,238 --> 01:59:27,740
# now my heart is so full up
it hurts #

1252
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:30,743
# it's heavy as a shopping bag #

1253
01:59:30,743 --> 01:59:34,247
# it's full of things
I should give back #

# don't want you to cover me #

1261

1262
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:26,299
# I like to feel

1263
02:00:26,299 --> 02:00:29,802

# didn't drink nothing fizzy #

1270

1271
02:00:56,829 --> 02:00:59,832
# don't know what got into me #

1272
02:00:59,832 --> 02:01:02,335
# daylight's a kind of robbery #

1273
02:01:02,335 --> 02:01:04,837
# the night is your geography #

1274
02:01:05,338 --> 02:01:08,341
# so you're not white
you're pink and rosy #

1275
02:01:08,341 --> 02:01:10,843
# could be right
but you're way above me #

1276
02:01:10,843 --> 02:01:13,346
# me, I'm in recovery #

1277
02:01:13,346 --> 02:01:16,349

# I'm a tourist

1279
02:01:18,851 --> 02:01:21,854
# you don't like
the photographs of me #

1280
02:01:21,854 --> 02:01:24,357
# so you've got a lot to say #

1281
02:01:24,357 --> 02:01:27,360
# you don't sleep around
but sometimes you stray #

1282
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:30,363
# you don't believe
often times you pray #

1283
02:01:30,363 --> 02:01:33,366
# for something
what is it, babe #
