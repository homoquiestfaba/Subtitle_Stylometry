1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,751
I think I got something.

2
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,872
- What'd you find?
- Looks like a cooking pot.

3
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,235
Could possibly be
Apalachee lndian.

4
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,549
It is, look at the water symbol.

5
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,199
- That's Apalachee.
- Right.

6
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:54,396
- This some kind of test?
- You just passed it.

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,553
We should be able to take the lady
and the kid without any trouble.

8
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,233
- What if he acts up?
- What's the matter,

9
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,470
you can't handle a teenager?

10
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,189
- It's nice here, isn't it?
- I love it.

11
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,669
Pete and I came down here once
before you were born.

12
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,070
We spent a week in New Prleans
and then ate our way

13
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,834
through the Cajun Country.
We had a wonderful time.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,276
- Mom, can we not talk about him?
- Michael, he's your father.

15
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,953
Pete Thornton was
a part-time father.

16
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,475
And you don't have to defend him.
You divorced him, remember?

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,991
Look, I know it's childish,

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,549
but when he didn't show up for
my high school graduation, it hurt.

19
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,153
It was his work, Michael.

20
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,912
He was always using that
for an excuse.

21
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,150
Look, he promised me
he'd be there, and he wasn't.

22
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,352
What was that?

23
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,431
Who are you? What's going on here?
Who are you?

24
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,749
- What do you want?
- Come here!

25
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,990
- What are you doing?
- Move them closer together.

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,669
- Get away from her!
- Stand still, tough guy.

27
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,718
- What do you want?
- Let go of her!

28
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,713
- Let her up! You're hurting her!
- No, no!

29
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,438
- Come on!
- Mom. Mom!

30
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,114
- Pkay, now hold her there.
- Look at the camera.

31
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,508
- Ph, please!
- Smile, lady.

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,311
- We're gonna make you a star.
- Please, what do you want?

33
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,319
It's a nightmare. That's my family.

34
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,118
And it's all because of me,
I'm sure of that.

35
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,918
Do you have any idea
who these guys are?

36
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,310
No, the message is
a computer printout.

37
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,596
No marks, no prints,
no way to trace it.

38
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,149
- Real professional.
- What about the videotape?

39
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,235
I've had experts go over it. Nothing.
No, all these kidnappers want is me.

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,719
The message begins with me flying

41
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,394
into Sherman Parish Airport,
Louisiana, tomorrow morning.

42
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,438
And I'll just bet they want you
arriving without company.

43
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,309
Yeah, or else Connie
and Michael are dead.

44
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,878
- Well, I guess I got a plane to catch.
- What?

45
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,031
Well, I figure I should get to Louisiana
before you do

46
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,078
- so they don't connect us.
- I can't ask you to help on this one.

47
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,271
So don't ask.

48
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,991
Frank. You surprised me.

49
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,476
Surprise kills. Remember that.

50
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,672
It's all arranged.

51
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,308
You'll pick up Thornton
in the morning.

52
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,629
I'm counting on you.

53
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,872
- Don't worry.
- Don't underestimate him.

54
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,396
Failure is betrayal.

55
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,069
Welcome to my small slice
of the world, Connie. Michael.

56
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,673
Who are you?

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,313
I'm an old friend of your father's.

58
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,951
I've been looking forward
to our meeting one day, Connie.

59
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,390
What do you want from us?

60
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,516
I wanna see the light of happiness
in your eyes.

61
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,114
And then I wanna watch
that light go out.

62
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,558
- You're crazy.
- Am l?

63
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,153
Who do you think
arranged for the grant

64
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,548
that brought you both down here?

65
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,910
That's right.

66
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,311
You're bait, to attract your husband

67
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,233
and your father, Peter Thornton.

68
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,470
My plane got into Louisiana
three hours

69
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,596
before Pete Thornton was due.

70
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,389
Gave me time to rent a bike
and to get a map.

71
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,433
Pete was scheduled
to arrive right about now.

72
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,592
He'd been instructed to hire a cab
and proceed to Parish Road, M- 1 2,

73
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,680
a dirt road
right in the middle of nowhere.

74
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,550
As soon as he was contacted
by the kidnappers,

75
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,678
we planned to activate
our communication system.

76
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,149
He was wearing one of those
ultramodern watches:

77
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,917
Tells time, reads the date
and sends out a radio signal.

78
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,752
I had the receiver.

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,753
So I could be out of sight...

80
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,436
... but not out of touch.

81
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,069
You sure this is
where you want let off, mister?

82
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,037
Yeah, thanks.

83
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,595
Get in, Mr. Thornton.

84
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,313
You're right on time.

85
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,476
- I wanna know if my family's all right.
- No talking.

86
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,029
I had to stay in radio range
or lose him.

87
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,632
Sometimes the best way to follow
a car without being spotted

88
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,870
is not to follow at all.

89
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:23,555
Especially when you have
a transmitter working for you.

90
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,589
Empty wagon parked
in the middle of Bayou country

91
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:58,958
with nobody around
gave rise to very strong notion:

92
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,475
They planned a vehicle switch.

93
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,155
Figured I should hang around
to see which road they'd take.

94
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,750
Put. This is where
we switch transportation.

95
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,558
So, what's this all about?

96
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,358
Simple.

97
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,078
I don't trust you.

98
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,312
Now get your clothes off.
Everything you got on.

99
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,872
What's the matter,
you think I'm wired?

100
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,156
You're wasting time, Mr. Thornton.

101
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,077
Whatever you say.

102
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,794
- Everything?
- All of it. Your shoes and your socks,

103
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,518
jewellery, the whole bit.

104
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,875
Hey, what about my money
and personal papers?

105
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,271
And I thought it was your family
you were worried about.

106
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,874
All right, you made your point.

107
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,439
Just hurry it up.

108
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,873
It's a good thing
we don't have a plane to catch.

109
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,276
Thornton, we don't have all day.

110
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,717
Listen, anybody could come driving
down the road here. I'm a little shy.

111
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,314
Do you mind if I finish
dressing over there?

112
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,756
Long as we watch.

113
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,599
Sure.

114
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,993
- You guys are really nervous.
- We're careful.

115
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,193
You know, if you really think I'm wired,
you should check everything.

116
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,113
I could have a microtransistor
in my shirt buttons.

117
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,317
- Come on, move it.
- Maybe I've got radioactive toenails.

118
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,754
Maybe we ought to pull them out.

119
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,229
You wanna start something out here
in front of God and everybody,

120
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,311
- go right ahead. Push it.
- Knock it off!

121
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,710
Come on, get those clothes on.
We're running late.

122
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,032
Ph, we're on a schedule?
Where we going?

123
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,351
You'll find out when we get there.
Just keep moving.

124
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,751
You're starting to get on my nerves.
Will you hurry up?

125
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,989
You don't really think I'd risk
having someone follow me, do you?

126
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,673
Maybe. Maybe not.

127
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,558
This way we have nothing
to worry about, do we?

128
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,634
Now what?

129
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,551
Step right in.

130
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,509
Don't you have something to finish?

131
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,758
All right, get moving.
You can keep the cash.

132
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,956
Burn everything else.

133
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,152
- Morning.
- Keep your mouth shut.

134
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,150
The signal was getting stronger,

135
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,834
which meant the vehicle was
coming back toward me in a hurry.

136
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,113
Nobody in it but the driver.

137
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,431
They had Pete,
and I had no way of tracking him.

138
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,117
All I could do was time my ride
and estimate where they were let off.

139
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,677
Excuse me.

140
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,549
You wouldn't happen to have seen
a couple of guys come by here--?

141
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:38,871
No, I ain't seen nothing.

142
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,359
And I'm busy.

143
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,078
What kind of flies you use,
if you don't mind my asking?

144
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,754
My own. Ties them myself.

145
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,157
Well, as long as they work.

146
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,079
- You fish?
- When I have time.

147
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,517
What do you pull out of here
besides catfish?

148
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,309
- Any bass or crappie?
- Bass, for sure.

149
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,797
My name's Pbadiah Moss.

150
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,469
MacGyver. I'd sure like to try this,

151
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,155
but I'm looking
for a friend right now.

152
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,595
Guy may have come by here
about ten, 1 2 minutes ago

153
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,433
- with a couple of other fellows.
- Your friend bald?

154
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,034
- Kind of on the hefty side?
- That's Pete.

155
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,191
Well, I might have seen him.

156
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,079
I'd sure appreciate
anything you could tell me.

157
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,556
They got into a skiff
and headed upriver.

158
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,758
Any idea where they
might be headed?

159
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,831
Into the swamp.

160
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,918
About 800 mile of it.

161
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,958
Bayous, shallows,
gators and snakes.

162
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:51,669
- Sounds like a great place to get lost.
- For sure.

163
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,152
Excepting this bayou runs
straight up four mile, then she splits.

164
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,517
You take the right channel,
she take you right to Gator Camp.

165
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,795
Can't miss it.

166
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,269
Big old branch in the water
with a tire nailed on it.

167
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,317
And you think that could
be where they're going?

168
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,913
Ain't no "could be."

169
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,878
Gator Camp only dry land
for 60 mile.

170
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,274
Them old boys with your friend?
I spied them there, week back.

171
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,036
Didn't care to stop and chat
with them then, neither.

172
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,192
Yep, they sound like the guys
I'm looking for.

173
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,118
I'm grateful.

174
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,952
My pleasure, sir.

175
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,919
Fishermen's got to help each other.

176
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,436
Besides, your friend...

177
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,831
...he didn't look real happy.

178
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,310
Yeah, that figures.

179
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,479
Listen, Pbadiah, I'd sure try
and make you a good deal

180
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,995
- if you'd rent me your boat.
- Ain't worth too much.

181
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:49,197
Engine, she's liable to just up
and stop on you.

182
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,472
I'll risk it.

183
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,113
- How much further?
- Relax, enjoy the view.

184
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,669
I'm worried about my family.
Do you mind?

185
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,513
They're fine so far.

186
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,555
- Thanks a lot.
- Take care, now, you hear?

187
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,830
Riverhead Pne to Gator Camp.
Do you read me?

188
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,078
I read you, Riverhead Pne.

189
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,360
- Go on.
- There's a man following Thornton,

190
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,794
name of MacGyver.

191
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,833
MacGyver. Pf course.

192
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,592
Pete would bring MacGyver.

193
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,478
I sent him upriver in my skiff.

194
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,671
He should reach the tire
on the branch in the river

195
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,638
at approximately 1 100 hours.

196
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,840
Good, very good. Come on up.

197
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,514
You can help us bury MacGyver.

198
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,389
MacGyver.

199
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,593
Obadiah started out by saying
he hadn't seen anything.

200
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,797
But for someone who didn't seem
to wanna get involved,

201
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,916
he sure wasn't too shy
about telling me

202
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,355
exactly where
Pete would be headed.

203
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,957
Right for that old tire
nailed to the big branch.

204
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,197
- Slow down, we're getting there.
- Don't worry yourself. I know the way.

205
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,352
- Where are they?
- They're locked up in the back.

206
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,911
Ph, Pete, thank God.

207
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,759
Michael, you--

208
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,911
- You both all right?
- Yeah.

209
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,352
Have you any idea
who's behind this?

210
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,159
It's been a long time, Peter.

211
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,953
Frank Bonner.

212
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,508
I thought you were dead.

213
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,148
Surprise.

214
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,993
- You do know him.
- We worked together once.

215
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,878
As I said,
we go back a long way, Michael.

216
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,951
Back into shadows and darkness.

217
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,270
- Right, Peter?
- Whatever happened,

218
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,750
whatever you think happened,
that's between you and me,

219
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,353
not my family. Let them go.

220
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,155
I can't.
Not until we all hear the truth.

221
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,553
And then I will extract payment...

222
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,672
...in full!

223
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,150
What's he talking about?

224
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,510
I don't know.

225
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,957
He's brought me here
for some crazy reason.

226
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,713
And he's dragged you two into it.

227
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,589
- He hates you, doesn't he?
- He thinks he does.

228
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,390
Connie, I'm sorry.

229
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,679
I always used to say,
"You have such interesting friends."

230
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,598
Obadiah said he tied
his own flies,

231
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,230
but the ones I saw stuck in his hat
were store-bought.

232
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,789
Made me start thinking about
the directions he gave me.

233
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,316
He didn't want me to get lost...

234
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,838
... but maybe he wanted
me to get found.

235
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,674
Well, I didn't wanna disappoint

236
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,432
whoever was gonna be
looking for me.

237
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,153
He said he was a mercenary.
Who is he?

238
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,754
He was one of our top agents
until he went sour.

239
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,719
We all had to deal in violence,
but he enjoyed it.

240
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,552
How many other men
have you seen besides him?

241
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,153
Three. The three who grabbed us.

242
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,878
Have you notified the FBl
or the police?

243
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,918
No, I couldn't risk that.
But I have got help coming.

244
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,275
MacGyver, he's a good friend.
You remember him.

245
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,557
Pne guy? I thought with your work,
you have a million connections.

246
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,392
They gave me instructions, Michael.

247
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,836
If I had an army follow me in here,
they'd arrive and find us all dead.

248
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:25,152
- MacGyver is the best I know.
- Yeah, but he's still only one man.

249
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,872
Come out. Move!

250
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,277
Somebody once told me that when
you're alone in enemy territory,

251
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:39,036
you have to stay low, stay careful
and make a moving target.

252
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,557
So I made one.

253
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,512
When it comes to art,
I'm no expert.

254
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,318
But I know what I like.

255
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,718
Corey! Frank gave us a little job.

256
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,519
Stay close,
you might learn something.

257
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,194
Peter, I'd like your opinion
on a matter of tactics:

258
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,998
The use of a backup man.

259
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,515
Boone failed to pick him up,
but you failed too.

260
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,477
What's the matter?
Did you forget the importance

261
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,949
of a secondary line of defence?

262
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,997
Your man's good.

263
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,752
But he's not perfect.

264
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,713
I don't know
what you're talking about.

265
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,238
MacGyver.

266
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,317
Dunn, come in.

267
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,756
I can hear his motor.
Figure maybe another 30 seconds.

268
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,552
- You sure it's the same dude?
- No question about it.

269
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,073
That's Pbadiah's boat.

270
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,996
He's dead,
and he doesn't even know it.

271
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,149
Hey, Frank.

272
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,755
That sound you heard?
We got him.

273
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,875
Message received. Return to base...

274
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,715
...and we'll go on
with our next piece of business.

275
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,639
Back in the room.

276
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:12,270
Well, the alligators ought
to be happy. Free lunch.

277
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,273
Look, just make sure they don't
leave anything.

278
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,632
- Don't worry.
- I'm going back to the cabin.

279
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,709
It was pretty obvious that Obadiah
had sold me down the river,

280
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,351
so I wasn't too upset that I hadn't
given him a deposit on his boat.

281
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:37,195
I figured I'd just shell out
a bonus to his buddies.

282
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,152
Hey, wish me luck.

283
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,710
Because if I don't make it back,
you could retire right here.

284
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,430
- Look, we can't just sit here.
- We wait.

285
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:36,115
We heard an explosion, that's all.
MacGyver is damn hard to kill.

286
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,111
Ph, come on. He's dead. Face it.

287
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,032
If we're gonna do anything,
we have to do it now.

288
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,350
- Michael, listen!
- Look, we're in here because of you!

289
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,671
And now you're gambling Mom's
life on one miracle man. He's dead!

290
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,912
- Temper, temper.
- And to hell with you.

291
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,995
Stop--

292
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,959
I can ice him, Frank.

293
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,589
No!

294
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,475
No, not that way,
and not that quickly.

295
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,199
No.

296
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:10,632
And you, Michael, if you ever
raise your voice to me again...

297
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,633
...I'll cut your tongue out.

298
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,870
Why can't you just tell us
what you want?

299
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,679
- He wants revenge.
- I want justice.

300
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,832
- What are you talking about?
- Your husband...

301
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:25,156
...killed my wife and my son.

302
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,515
This your courtroom, Frank?

303
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,639
You sit in that chair over there.
I want your family to hear the truth.

304
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:08,308
Three and a half years ago in Yemen,
I was Pete's point man in the field.

305
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,756
And I moved my wife
and my son there to live.

306
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,718
- Well, that was your choice.
- You said it was under control.

307
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,472
It was when we started.

308
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,712
Three other agents moved their
families there to live too, remember?

309
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,110
Safety factor was fine.

310
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:23,998
You know what went wrong, Frank.

311
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,157
Corey, give me the pliers.

312
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,119
Come on!

313
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,717
We were sent there
to keep the peace,

314
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:51,077
and we ended up in the middle
of a tribal war, didn't we?

315
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:59,276
And that's when you ran out
on me and my family.

316
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,759
Have you ever explained any of this
to your wife and your son?

317
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,717
Everything about that operation
was classified

318
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,190
until a couple of months ago.
I couldn't explain anything...

319
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,910
...not even to my family.

320
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,190
What about my wife?

321
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,191
And my son?

322
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,396
What I had was a donkey engine,

323
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,711
which got its name
because it works like a mule.

324
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,440
And I had a fair amount of rope.

325
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,632
By attaching the rope
to the engine,

326
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,995
I could create an awful lot
of pulling power,

327
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:41,312
the kind of power that would
hopefully get Pete and his family out.

328
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,915
But I had one little problem:

329
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,072
I had to start the engine
while I was up close to the house,

330
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,913
which was about 50 feet away.

331
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,317
Sometimes the only way
you can solve a problem

332
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,153
is to be in two places at once.

333
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,870
By splicing a piece of wire
into the rope

334
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,554
and then connecting it
to the ignition switch,

335
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,836
I had just what I needed:

336
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,594
A long-distance starter cord.

337
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,513
Frank's wife and son
got caught in a guerrilla raid.

338
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,159
Like the rest of us.

339
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,072
The only difference was
they got caught alone

340
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,878
because you weren't there
to protect them.

341
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,473
I was in the field.

342
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,315
I sent them to you for safety,
and you ran out on them.

343
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,550
That's what you've been
telling yourself for three years?

344
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,153
- That's what happened.
- What happened

345
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,995
to the almost $800,000 you
were given to buy us information?

346
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,232
- So we could make the right moves?
- Don't change the subject.

347
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,437
Ph, that is the subject, Frank,
because you never contacted anybody.

348
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:55,194
You never recruited anybody,
you never paid anybody.

349
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,670
You faked intelligence reports,
and you kept the money.

350
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,628
- What the hell are you talking about?
- You embezzled agency funds, Frank!

351
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,678
So that when the Sharit attacked,
we had no warning. Not a clue!

352
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,195
Shut up! You're lying now,
just like you did then.

353
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,669
Ph, you sent your wife
and your son to me, sure!

354
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,309
- And you weren't there.
- But it wasn't for their safety, was it?

355
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,754
It was so they'd be out of the way

356
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,717
while you shipped out the money
you'd stolen!

357
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,950
- You weren't there!
- No, because I got hit

358
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,917
in the attack
you didn't warn us about.

359
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,071
The same attack
that killed your family.

360
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:26,277
No! You're responsible
for their death.

361
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:29,079
And payment will be made.

362
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:40,078
You're the one who's paying, Frank.
And it's killing you.

363
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,590
You can't lay your guilt on me.

364
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,354
It doesn't work, it won't fit.

365
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:51,159
Look, what happened was terrible.

366
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,118
And you're gonna have to live
with that your whole life,

367
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,113
but doing this isn't gonna help.

368
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,510
For God's sake, Frank,
we were friends once.

369
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,433
Friends?

370
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,829
That's good, Peter.

371
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,353
But not good enough.

372
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,877
There will be a death.
There will be an execution.

373
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,151
No.

374
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,317
Ph, I wouldn't dream
of killing him now.

375
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:23,077
I want him to learn something first.

376
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:26,394
I want him to see his son dead.

377
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,357
Like I saw mine.

378
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,315
Dad.

379
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,519
In order for my plan to work,

380
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:37,717
I had to get the bad guys
out of the house.

381
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,953
To do that, I had to get
their attention.

382
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:50,390
This can of gas should
do the trick just fine.

383
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,076
An oil-soaked rag
makes a perfect fuse.

384
00:34:55,400 --> 00:35:00,349
It'll burn slow, so I can get away
before I blow myself up.

385
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,909
It's very hard, I know.

386
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,316
But don't blame me,
blame your father.

387
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,268
Now, I want you to stand up.
Let's go outside very quietly.

388
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:29,678
- Lock them up in the room, quick!
- Come on, come on, move!

389
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,597
- What's happening?
- It's got to be MacGyver.

390
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,473
- Come on!
- Go!

391
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,153
Head that way!

392
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,589
I'll distract them.

393
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,152
Come on!

394
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,518
Don't even think about moving.

395
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,231
There's nothing we can do right now.
Come on.

396
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,913
But Mom--

397
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,196
If we can get away,
we can come back.

398
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,918
Now, come on.

399
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,355
Where's the boy?

400
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,434
Where is he? Find the boy.

401
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,431
Find him!

402
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:38,194
All right, move. Move it!

403
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,792
Stay close.

404
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,831
I think we lost them.

405
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,832
Get down.

406
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,475
- Don't sweat it, we'll find them.
- I want that MacGyver.

407
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,359
I don't know how
he got past me last time.

408
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,116
- Hi, name's MacGyver.
- I know.

409
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,793
So, what are we gonna do?

410
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,030
The guy Bonner's crazy.
He could kill my mom and Pete.

411
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,077
No, not while they're still out
hunting for us.

412
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,754
We got time.
You know what methane is?

413
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,035
- Swamp gas.
- Yeah.

414
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,156
I'm no chemist,
but I know it stinks and it burns.

415
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,436
It also explodes when it's confined.

416
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,718
So if we put some swamp gas
in a container, we got a little bomb.

417
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,950
And for containers...

418
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,156
Bamboo? To make bombs?

419
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,359
You bet. It's hollow,
and it's got its own built-in plugs.

420
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,389
So start cutting some lengths
about 3 to 4 feet.

421
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,597
Then we'll start our own fireworks.

422
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,150
I thought he was Corey.
He was wearing Corey's fatigues.

423
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:02,074
He took Corey out. And you.

424
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,032
You didn't find him.

425
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,270
It'll be dark soon, Frank,
we'll nail them in the morning.

426
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,998
Sure, all we gotta do is wait.

427
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,435
Ph, is that your expert opinion?

428
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,318
Then you take the first watch.

429
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,471
Go on, get out of here!

430
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,910
Methane's lighter than gas,
so it rises,

431
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:26,038
pushes the air out of
the bamboo piece until it's full of gas.

432
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,794
- Well, how do you know when it's full?
- Use your nose.

433
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,999
It's full.

434
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,191
This is the tricky part.

435
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,352
All right.

436
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,311
All right, there she is.

437
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,313
Loaded, armed and fused.

438
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,239
What if you're wrong? I mean,
methane's supposed to burn, but--

439
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,472
You're right. So, what do you say
we try a little field test, huh?

440
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:26,434
- My God, it might work.
- Yeah. It better.

441
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,594
Pete's a really good friend
of yours, isn't he?

442
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,079
The best.

443
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,792
You call him Pete, huh?

444
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,032
Yeah, I guess that's the way I think
of him. He was never very close,

445
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,236
not much of a father.

446
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,391
Yeah, well, he's made some
mistakes, that's for sure.

447
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,391
He's not perfect.

448
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,673
- But he tried, didn't he?
- Yeah, I'll give him that.

449
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,752
It's just that he never
let me get close.

450
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,515
And I just found out why
he missed my graduation.

451
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,829
He had a good reason,

452
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,753
it's just that he never explained it
to me, he never let me understand.

453
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,593
- It was classified. He couldn't.
- That was three years ago.

454
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,991
And two of his men were held hostage
for 31 months of that three years.

455
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,754
- He couldn't say anything.
- He couldn't explain that?

456
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,992
Are you kidding me?
He took an oath. He lives by that.

457
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,192
He wanted to tell you,
when they were finally freed.

458
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,669
About five months back, remember?
You wouldn't see him.

459
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,319
I was busy. I...

460
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,590
I didn't wanna get in a fight.

461
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,189
I guess I was afraid
of being angry or hurt.

462
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,271
I don't know. I just...

463
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,509
I don't understand him.

464
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,592
Yeah, well, he doesn't
understand you very well either.

465
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,714
But he sure loves you.

466
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,792
When do you graduate
from college?

467
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,796
- In two years, why?
- lnvite him.

468
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,958
I can guarantee you he'll be there.

469
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,957
It's over, Frank.

470
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,956
MacGyver's clear.

471
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,634
He'll be back tomorrow,
and he won't be alone.

472
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,789
Wrong.

473
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,952
The only way out of here's by boat,
and we've got that covered.

474
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:04,430
Double-check it. And see
that Dunn's on his toes out there.

475
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:11,512
If this sours, if I lose the boy,
the rules change.

476
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,071
Connie first...

477
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,272
...then you.

478
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,591
MacGyver! Find him!

479
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,990
Let's go, outside. Come on, move!

480
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,351
Mike. Come on. We gotta hustle.

481
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:03,355
They're out there. They got Dunn.

482
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,239
Well, we'll give them
something to watch.

483
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,632
Shoot her!

484
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,789
Shoot her!

485
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,833
No!

486
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,629
Stay here.

487
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,228
They're throwing bombs.

488
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,913
- Where the hell did they get them?
- How do I know?

489
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:43,035
Look out! There's another one!

490
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:32,072
Michael, no!

491
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,834
- He was gonna kill you.
- That's what he is,

492
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,991
not what we are, son.

493
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:42,518
Listen to your father, Mike.
You know he's right.

494
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,559
I call this my Cajun cuisine special:

495
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,676
Bayou-burned blackened redfish.

496
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,070
Don't tell me you picked that up
while down in New Prleans?

497
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,434
I flew in early, remember?

498
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,751
I had time enough to collect
a few recipes, pass the time.

499
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,195
Are you sure you're supposed
to add that much Tabasco?

500
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:22,909
- Trust me, Connie, trust me.
- Come on, Mom, live dangerously.

501
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:26,197
Speaking of which, he said subtly...

502
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,354
...how would you like to go to
the Lakers game tomorrow night?

503
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:32,353
Are you all of a sudden
playing dad, Dad?

504
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,876
Yeah, I am.

505
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,992
In that case, it'd be terrific.

506
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,958
