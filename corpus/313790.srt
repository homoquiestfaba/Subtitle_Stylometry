1
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:35,827
You mustn't listen
to what your younger brother says.

2
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,023
I can't think of anyone less
an authority on female anatomy.

3
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:41,032
He can see. It's enormous.

4
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,934
- No, it isn't.
- It's hideous.

5
00:01:45,038 --> 00:01:48,007
Why don't you show me that dress again?

6
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:54,013
It is a bit full here.
Let me have it.

7
00:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,384
Thanks, Mom.

8
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:10,129
Tsk.

9
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,097
<i>- Taxi.!
- Taxi. Taxi.!</i>

10
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:46,859
<i>- Is this your cab?
- It's not my cab.</i>

11
00:02:46,966 --> 00:02:49,594
- Is this your cab?
- Really, it's not my cab.

12
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:51,693
- We'll share it.
- But I don't want it.

13
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:55,171
No, we'll share it. I insist.
That way there'll be no ill feelings.

14
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,175
<i>- Are you going to Sally's too?
- No.</i>

15
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:01,043
Well, that settles it. Come with us.
That way we'll all be going the same direction.

16
00:03:01,147 --> 00:03:03,615
You should come, otherwise
we're all gonna freeze out here.

17
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:06,184
<i>Come on.!</i>

18
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,920
- Hi. I'm Nick.
- Hi, Nick. I'm Tom.

19
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,923
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Jane. This is Audrey.

20
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,960
- Hi,Jane.
- You are going to Sally's, aren't you?

21
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,961
Of course there's a God.
We all basically know there is.

22
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,464
<i>- I know no such thing.
- Of course you do.</i>

23
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:24,435
When you think to yourself-And most of our
waking life is taken up thinking to ourself-

24
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,700
<i>you must have that feeling
that your thoughts aren't entirely wasted...</i>

25
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:29,707
<i>that, in some sense,
they are being heard.</i>

26
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,801
Hey, I think it's this sensation
of silently being listened to...

27
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:34,812
with total comprehension...

28
00:03:34,914 --> 00:03:37,314
- Hi, Sally.
- You got here so fast.

29
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:40,113
- Hello!
- that represents our innate belief in a supreme being.

30
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,120
- Nice to meet you.
- We stole his cab.

31
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,123
- What's his name again?
- Tom Townsend.

32
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,625
No, I think it was something else.

33
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,218
No, it's Tom Townsend, I'm sure.

34
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,230
He looks familiar.

35
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,063
He's the guy that was sitting at the table
behind ours without talking to anyone all evening.

36
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:59,070
Then, outside, he got the cab
that we were trying to flag down.

37
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,073
But he insisted that we take it,
so Nick insisted that he come along too...

38
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,075
so that there should be no ill feeling.

39
00:04:04,177 --> 00:04:07,305
What it shows is that a kind of belief
is innate in all of us.

40
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,313
At some point
most of us lose that...

41
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,316
after which it can only be regained
by a conscious act of faith.

42
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,318
You've experienced that?

43
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,320
Uh, no, I haven't.

44
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,822
I- I hope to someday.

45
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,190
Actually, it wasn't my cab. I was just there
waiting for the light to change when it pulled up.

46
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,786
- I never take cabs.
- You never take cabs?

47
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,297
No, I either walk
or take public transportation.

48
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,300
- Why?
- A lot of reasons.

49
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:32,735
So you're one of those
public transportation snobs.

50
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:36,297
- You look down on people who take taxis.
- No, not at all.

51
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:40,641
<i>That's how New York's seen,
at least in the popular imagination.</i>

52
00:04:40,747 --> 00:04:43,648
I don't think that there is
a popular imagination.

53
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,650
- What do you mean?
- Just that.

54
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,721
I don't think that there is
a popular imagination.

55
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,721
- Pomfret. Where did you go?
- Farmington.

56
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,723
Both of us did.

57
00:04:52,825 --> 00:04:54,725
Did you know Serena Slocum there?

58
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:56,727
- The inevitable question.
- What?

59
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:01,232
All the guys ask that. Serena had
an incredible number of boyfriends. At least 20.

60
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,235
She could manage it because
they were all at different schools...

61
00:05:04,337 --> 00:05:06,237
and she wrote letters
incredibly quickly.

62
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,536
Three in a single study hall.
She became really famous.

63
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:12,805
<i>It's incredible how naive some guys are.
How do you know Serena?</i>

64
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:15,813
<i>Actually, that might give someone
the wrong impression.</i>

65
00:05:15,915 --> 00:05:18,816
She wrote a lot of guys, but I'm sure
she liked some a lot more than others.

66
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:22,251
Oh, you think so? I never noticed that.
How do you know Serena?

67
00:05:23,356 --> 00:05:25,221
I was one of her boyfriends.

68
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:28,226
Oh.
You must be Pomfret.

69
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,228
- Your letters were really good.
- Yes.

70
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,423
<i>- What do you mean?
- They were interesting.</i>

71
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,659
Serena let you read my letters?

72
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,325
No. She read them aloud.

73
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,365
I can't believe it.

74
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:41,872
She only read us the ones
that she thought were really good.

75
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,874
Or really bad.
But yours were really good.

76
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:47,275
There was no suggestion of ridicule, if that's
what's worrying you. At least not that I can recall.

77
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:50,281
I remember a long letter you wrote Serena
about agrarian socialism.

78
00:05:50,383 --> 00:05:53,284
I think it was one of the first things
to set Alice Dreyer off about Marxism.

79
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,946
Since then she's joined
the Red Underground Army.

80
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:58,546
If she blows herself up,
it'll be your fault.

81
00:05:58,658 --> 00:06:01,559
<i>It's actually surprising
to see you at something like this.</i>

82
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:04,391
In your letters, you expressed
a vehement opposition to deb parties...

83
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:06,397
and to conventional society
in general.

84
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,399
- I take it you've changed your mind.
- No.

85
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:12,130
- I'm just as much opposed to them as ever.
- Then what made you decide to come tonight?

86
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:13,865
He got an invitation.

87
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:18,637
He's right. I got an invitation and didn't
particularly have anything else to do.

88
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:21,373
I think that's the case
with almost everybody.

89
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,915
No. Nick goes
whether he's invited or not.

90
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:28,476
Unlike Tom, I'm in favor of these kind of parties,
and I wanna show that support however I can.

91
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:32,922
It's a bit ridiculous for someone to say
they're morally opposed to deb parties...

92
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:34,925
and then attend them anyways.

93
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:36,927
It's - It's untenable.

94
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,395
- Everyone does.
- But that's no contradiction.

95
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,399
I wasn't trying to.

96
00:06:41,501 --> 00:06:44,629
I think it's justifiable to go once,
to know firsthand what it is you oppose.

97
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,638
I'd read Veblen, but it was amazing to see
that these things still go on.

98
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,971
- You're a Marxist?
- No, I'm a committed socialist, not a Marxist.

99
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,241
I favor the socialist model developed by
the 19th-century French social critic Fourier.

100
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:57,077
You're a Fourierist?

101
00:06:57,183 --> 00:06:59,151
Yes.

102
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,619
Fourierism was tried
in the 19th century and failed.

103
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,054
I mean, wasn't Brook Farm Fourierist?

104
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,490
- It failed.
- That's debatable.

105
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,619
- Whether Brook Farm failed?
- That it ceased to exist, I'll grant you.

106
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:13,722
But whether it was really a failure
I don't think can be definitively said.

107
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:17,394
Well -Well, for me,
ceasing to exist is failure.

108
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:20,131
I mean, that's -
that's pretty definitive.

109
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:24,300
Well, everyone ceases to exist.
That doesn't mean everyone's a failure.

110
00:07:26,312 --> 00:07:28,542
- You really feel that way?
- I really do.

111
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,946
- Really?
- Really!

112
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,950
Tom Townsend.

113
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:34,952
Tom Townsend.

114
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,954
It's a fine name.

115
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,684
What about Tommy?
Tommy Townsend?

116
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,692
It's sounds more U.C.

117
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,694
Really? What's that?

118
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,562
Well, we come here all the time,
thus the S.F.R.P. -

119
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:50,067
- Sally Fowler Rat Pack.
- Oh.

120
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,003
Mine and Charlie's are too.

121
00:07:53,105 --> 00:07:55,005
But that's the ex -
exception though.

122
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:59,009
I mean, divorce is actually comparatively rare
among standard New York social types...

123
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:01,011
contrary to what people might think.

124
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,013
Well, usually there's
something wrong though.

125
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:05,015
Dead fathers are a common problem.

126
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:07,244
Jane's father's dead.
Very suddenly, last year.

127
00:08:07,353 --> 00:08:09,583
- Must have been awful for her.
- Yes.

128
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:11,589
It was tough on him too.

129
00:08:11,691 --> 00:08:14,592
That's different though.
That doesn't mean a broken home.

130
00:08:14,694 --> 00:08:16,924
Well, it still means having your mother
go out on dates.

131
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:20,430
My point was that the common image
of divorce and decadent behavior...

132
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,933
being prevalent among
New York social types...

133
00:08:23,035 --> 00:08:24,935
is not really accurate.

134
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,028
That's more Southampton.

135
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,119
<i>Okay, Cynthia, let's cha-cha-cha.</i>

136
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:44,121
It's completely ridiculous.

137
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:46,623
Oh, now, the cha-cha
is no more ridiculous than life itself.

138
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,217
- I don't know how to do it.
- You must have learned it in dancing school.

139
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,421
<i>- Cynthia was a dancing school dropout.
- I've got it.</i>

140
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,692
<i>? Cha-cha-cha?</i>

141
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:55,630
Ah, the cha-cha.

142
00:08:55,735 --> 00:08:59,535
I don't think it's possible to forget the cha-cha.
I think you're blocking it out.

143
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:03,439
# Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha #

144
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,374
# Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha #

145
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:08,936
# Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha
Cha-cha, cha-cha-cha #

146
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,107
Tom! Audrey!
# Cha-cha-cha #

147
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:14,118
<i>Tom! Audrey! # Cha-cha-cha #</i>

148
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,154
<i>I love this.</i>

149
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:18,155
<i>? Cha-cha-cha?</i>

150
00:09:18,257 --> 00:09:20,623
Oh!
# Cha-cha-cha #

151
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:23,092
Bob! # Cha-cha-cha ##
Bob!

152
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,866
- Hi.
- Hi.

153
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,636
- What are you doing here in the dark?
- I was just getting a glass of water.

154
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,706
Oh.

155
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,136
- It's gone awfully late.
- Yes.

156
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,145
What time do after-parties end?

157
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,147
There's no set time.

158
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,410
They usually end
whenever people go...

159
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:48,009
or whenever the parents get up.

160
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,520
Although the last time I was here,
over Thanksgiving...

161
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:52,853
Sally's parents asked us
to stay for breakfast.

162
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,859
That's amazing.

163
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:57,862
- No one stayed except Nick.
- Really?

164
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,864
He likes everyone's parents.

165
00:09:59,966 --> 00:10:02,867
I don't think I've ever met
anyone's parents, except Serena's.

166
00:10:02,969 --> 00:10:05,938
I once had quite a long talk
with her father.

167
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:10,765
What's the situation
between you and Serena now?

168
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:12,844
There is none.

169
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:17,049
- When did you stop seeing each other?
- Yale game weekend.

170
00:10:23,856 --> 00:10:25,824
<i>Dawn in the big city.</i>

171
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,928
There are eight million stories
out there.

172
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,575
- Give our apologies to them.
- Oh, it's not necessary.

173
00:10:44,677 --> 00:10:46,577
No, I think it is.
Good night.

174
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,579
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.

175
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,581
- Good night.
- Thank you.

176
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,583
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Thanks a lot.

177
00:10:52,685 --> 00:10:54,585
- You're welcome. We'll see you tonight?
- No.

178
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,554
<i>- You should come. Hope's a friend of ours.
- You won't be coming to any more dances?</i>

179
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,887
- No.
- Oh, well, that's a shame.

180
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:02,552
- It was nice meeting you.
- Thank you. It was nice to meet you.

181
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,062
- Ciao, Sally. Ciao!
- Ciao!

182
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:07,792
- Good luck with your Fourierism.
- Thank you.

183
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,738
Unless we get a Checker,
we're gonna have to take two cabs.

184
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,741
- Don't worry about me. I'm gonna walk.
- Really? But it's terribly cold.

185
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,243
- I prefer to walk.
- You'll freeze dressed like that.

186
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,315
This is actually very warm.
It has a lining.

187
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,789
- Good-bye. Ciao, Tom.
- Bye-bye, Tom.

188
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:36,862
- Good night.
- Bye.

189
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,301
Where are we headed?

190
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:47,463
He's gonna freeze dressed like that
in weather like this.

191
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,235
Driver, follow that pedestrian.

192
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,812
- Hey, fella!
- We have a Checker. Can we give you a lift?

193
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,910
- No, thanks.
- You sure?

194
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,989
Yep. Thanks anyway.

195
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,967
He's getting a crosstown bus.

196
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:19,037
That explains it.

197
00:12:20,172 --> 00:12:22,140
A Westsider is amongst us.

198
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,061
There is a real escort shortage.

199
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,028
It's no joke.

200
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:23,625
- What was your impression of him?
- He seemed nice. I didn't talk to him much.

201
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:26,637
Mom, I don't want to seem rude.
I know I got up very late.

202
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,639
But I'm having what,
for me, is breakfast...

203
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:31,642
and I really don't want to think about
returning my tuxedo right now.

204
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:34,645
- It's just that I think it's getting too late -
- Mom, get off my back!

205
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:37,215
It's nearly 6:00.
They're going to close.

206
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,943
Jesus!

207
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,123
If I have to pay for another day-

208
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,479
<i>Was it already closed?</i>

209
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:16,953
<i>How much extra will it cost?</i>

210
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,718
Twenty-five dollars.

211
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:22,726
- I'm sorry about what I said earlier.
- Not at all.

212
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:25,456
A girl called.
Her number's by the kitchen phone.

213
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,794
<i>She said it was a bit urgent.</i>

214
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,801
I know it's very late,
but we had trouble getting your number.

215
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:34,566
Basically, we'd all be going together,
although officially you'd be Audrey's escort.

216
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:36,607
- Who?
- Audrey Rouget.

217
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,041
The party should be
of some sociological interest.

218
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:42,011
Peter Duchin,
the Plaza ballroom, et cetera.

219
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,947
- You think you'll be able to come?
- Um -

220
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,178
Well, actually, there's a bit
of an escort shortage.

221
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,841
Hi, Rick.

222
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:25,015
<i>What a mystery. Rick Von Sloneker
and Serena Slocum, still together.</i>

223
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:27,615
<i>- Seems like months.
- It has been months.</i>

224
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,126
Well, one thing's for certain -
she's lost her virginity by now.

225
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,325
- How can you say that?
- You're right. Maybe she wasn't a virgin.

226
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,174
- Riffraff.
- He's hardly that.

227
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,439
Oh, you mean because of his title.
We're supposed to be impressed by that.

228
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:51,277
On the contrary, I think the titled
aristocracy are the scum of the Earth.

229
00:15:54,219 --> 00:15:56,710
<i>By Tolstoy, War and Peace...</i>

230
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,916
<i>and byJane Austen,
Persuasion and Mansfield Park.</i>

231
00:16:00,025 --> 00:16:02,653
<i>Mansfield Park?
You've got to be kidding.</i>

232
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:05,457
- No.
- But it's a notoriously bad book.

233
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,964
Even Lionel Trilling,
one of her greatest admirers, thought that.

234
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,661
Well, if Lionel Trilling thought that,
he's an idiot.

235
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,966
The whole story
revolves around, what...

236
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,473
<i>the immorality of a group of young people
putting on a play.</i>

237
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:19,510
In the context of the novel
it makes perfect sense.

238
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:22,512
But the context of the novel,
and nearly everything Jane Austen wrote...

239
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,514
is near ridiculous
from today's perspective.

240
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,608
Has it ever occurred to you that today,
looked at from Jane Austen's perspective...

241
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,688
would look even worse?

242
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,629
You must be freezing
dressed in that.

243
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:42,030
- It has a lining.
- What kind of lining is it?

244
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:44,034
You gonna wear a raincoat all winter?

245
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,900
Princeton's south of here.
I guess it's a lot warmer.

246
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,907
No, I just didn't know
where to get a good overcoat.

247
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,409
Uh, Brooks,J. Press, Tripler-

248
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,911
Actually, I haven't had time to buy one.

249
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:20,271
<i>I'm not sure I wanna go back to Princeton
next year. It's too much of a country club for me.</i>

250
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,272
You really shouldn't
treat Serena that way.

251
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:24,934
- What?
- Giving her the silent treatment.

252
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,945
- I'm not giving her the silent treatment.
- Come on.

253
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,948
I'm not giving her the silent treatment.
I just don't have anything to say to her.

254
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,951
Listen, I know you're angry with her.
You're probably right to be.

255
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,454
But it's still not right to treat her that way.
I think Serena really feels hurt by it.

256
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,456
Oh, give me a break!

257
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:41,788
Serena Slocum, a real feeling?

258
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,795
Serena's basically a good person.

259
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,424
- She has feelings like anybody else.
- I find that very hard to believe.

260
00:17:48,534 --> 00:17:50,968
All this is - is pretty deceptive.

261
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,971
- All what?
- Well, I -

262
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,804
I think that - that -
that we are all, in a sense, doomed.

263
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,775
What are you talking about?

264
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:01,778
Downward social mobility.

265
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,781
We hear a lot about
the great social mobility in America...

266
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:08,546
with the focus usually on
the comparative ease of moving upwards.

267
00:18:08,654 --> 00:18:12,522
What's less discussed is
how easy it is to - to go down.

268
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,525
I think that's the -
the direction that we're all heading in.

269
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:18,528
And I think that the downward fall
is gonna be very fast.

270
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:23,124
Not just for us as individuals,
but the whole preppy class.

271
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,635
Where do you get all this?

272
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:29,833
Well,just look around. Take those
of our fathers who grew up very well off.

273
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:32,536
<i>Maybe their careers
started out well enough...</i>

274
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,772
<i>butjust as their contemporaries
really began to accomplish things...</i>

275
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:37,849
<i>they started to quit...</i>

276
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,850
on rising above office politics...

277
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,853
or- or refusing to compete
and risk open failure.

278
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,515
Or not - not doing
the humdrum part of the job.

279
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,524
<i>Or only doing the humdrum part.</i>

280
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:51,756
Or gradually spending more and more time
on something more interesting -

281
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,764
um, conservation, or the arts...

282
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,198
where even if they were total failures
no one would know it.

283
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,360
Okay.

284
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,371
I guess we all know
who you're talking about.

285
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,441
I can't deny your point, but...

286
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:07,171
unlike you, I've always
assumed I'd be a failure anyway.

287
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,305
That's why I plan to marry
an extremely rich woman.

288
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,250
Pretty depressing.

289
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,912
A bit overstated, don't you think?

290
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,922
- I'm not so sure.
- "Doomed. "

291
00:19:19,024 --> 00:19:20,924
Even if he were right...

292
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,189
it wouldn't be any great tragedy if some
of these people lost their class prerogatives.

293
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:26,696
"These people" are everyone I know.

294
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:31,758
And besides, it's not a question of losing
class prerogatives, whatever that means...

295
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,771
but the prospect of wasting
your whole productive life...

296
00:19:34,873 --> 00:19:36,773
of personal failure.

297
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,775
That's so melodramatic.

298
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,778
Life is melodramatic,
if you look at the whole sweep of it.

299
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,280
I don't know.

300
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,284
I think my father
considers himself a failure...

301
00:19:47,386 --> 00:19:49,354
although I don't think he's one.

302
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,954
I guess few people's lives...

303
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:55,026
match their own expectations.

304
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,867
I always drink two glasses of water
before going to bed anyway.

305
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:05,937
It's great for your complexion.

306
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:10,939
I thought I should mention I'm putting you
on the floor committee for the Christmas ball.

307
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:14,638
Essentially, all it means is, you'll be able to go
on your own rather than as someone's escort...

308
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,647
and that you'll get
a white carnation for your lapel.

309
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:20,650
Thanks a lot, but actually I'm not
planning to go to any more dances.

310
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,652
You weren't?

311
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:25,154
Well, I strongly advise you
to change your mind.

312
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:27,555
Is it that your resources
are limited?

313
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,924
This is about the only economical
social life you're gonna find in New York.

314
00:20:31,029 --> 00:20:34,931
Music, drinks, entertainment,
hot, nutritious meals...

315
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,228
all at no expense to you.

316
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,237
Basically, all you need
is one suit of evening clothes...

317
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,239
and a tailcoat.

318
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:46,243
Dances are either white tie or black tie,
so you only need two ties.

319
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,679
- You rented that from where?
- A.T. Harris.

320
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:52,011
Oh, good!
You know about Harris.

321
00:20:52,117 --> 00:20:54,483
They also sell them secondhand,
very inexpensively.

322
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,486
<i>- It's a good arrangement.
- Thanks a lot.</i>

323
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,148
My resources are limited,
but actually that's not it.

324
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,750
<i>I know. You're opposed
to these parties on principle.</i>

325
00:21:02,861 --> 00:21:05,261
- Yes.
- Exactly what principle is that?

326
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,264
Well -

327
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,267
The principle that one shouldn't be out
at night eating hors d'oeuvres...

328
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,270
when one could be home
worrying about the less fortunate.

329
00:21:13,372 --> 00:21:15,272
Pretty much, yes.

330
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:19,367
<i>Has it ever occurred to you
that you are the less fortunate?</i>

331
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,472
I mean, there's something
a tiny bit arrogant...

332
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:28,315
about people going around feeling sorry
for other people they consider less fortunate.

333
00:21:28,420 --> 00:21:31,116
<i>Are the more fortunate
really so terrific?</i>

334
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,783
Do you want some much-richer guy
going around saying...

335
00:21:33,892 --> 00:21:38,386
"Poor Tom Townsend doesn't even have
a winter jacket - I can't go to any more parties"?

336
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,397
That's a bit cynical.

337
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:43,400
This is not just a matter
of what you personally prefer.

338
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:46,699
I'll tell you this in confidence.
You've made a big impression on these girls -

339
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,705
<i>- Oh, come on.!
- No, I'm serious.</i>

340
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:53,210
They like you and are now
counting on you as an escort.

341
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,678
Well, I like them, too,
but that doesn't -

342
00:21:55,781 --> 00:21:59,683
<i>I'm not sure if you realize this, but these girls
are at a very vulnerable point in their lives.</i>

343
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:04,779
All of this is much more emotional
and difficult for them than it is for us.

344
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,790
They're on display.

345
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:10,157
They have to call the guys up
and invite them as escorts.

346
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:13,163
And preppy girls mature socially
much later than others do.

347
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,166
For many of them, this is the first
serious social life they've had...

348
00:22:16,268 --> 00:22:20,398
and if you just disappear now,
they're gonna take that as personal rejection.

349
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,668
- Give me a break.
- I'm not entirely joking.

350
00:22:23,775 --> 00:22:25,834
You should go.

351
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:29,436
IfThorstein Veblen were here,
he'd tell you the same thing.

352
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:35,252
I'll meet you at 4:30 at Brooks,
main floor, southwest corner...

353
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,879
where the pajamas intersect
with the expensive shirts...

354
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:39,957
right across from
the undershorts counter.

355
00:22:42,094 --> 00:22:44,460
As a romance,
it never really existed.

356
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,054
- Really?
- I made a classic mistake.

357
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,633
I fell in love with Serena
long before I met her.

358
00:22:49,735 --> 00:22:53,068
I'd seen her at a Chapin dance,
but I didn't really meet her until a year later.

359
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:58,074
Even before we started going out,
I'd built up this huge romantic vision about her.

360
00:22:58,176 --> 00:23:00,076
It should be just the reverse.

361
00:23:00,178 --> 00:23:02,578
You should get to know someone
gradually, over time...

362
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,081
before the possibility of falling in love
even occurs to you.

363
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:07,083
Possibly not even then.

364
00:23:07,185 --> 00:23:09,346
So the experience
has somewhat hardened you?

365
00:23:09,454 --> 00:23:14,153
Yes. At least, it's a very bad idea to fall
for someone who doesn't for you.

366
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:19,863
Yes, but you can't know that you'll feel
exactly the same way all the time.

367
00:23:19,965 --> 00:23:22,866
I mean, I suppose
there will be risk in any romance.

368
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:24,868
I suppose so.

369
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,438
Well, this is my building.

370
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,839
- Thanks very much for coming.
- Thank you.

371
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,507
You'll come again tomorrow?
It'll be as a group.

372
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,582
Yes.

373
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,249
Thanks, Mom.
I know how tight things have been.

374
00:24:13,351 --> 00:24:16,013
<i>- Things haven't been that tight.
- I'll pay you back next month.</i>

375
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,021
Or in February.

376
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,024
- Has Dad called?
- He's never called here. You know that.

377
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,720
- I thought maybe his office had.
- No.

378
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:25,797
Thanks a lot.

379
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,264
- They're normally this long in the back?
- Yes, sir.

380
00:24:33,371 --> 00:24:35,669
- Uh-huh.
- Like to try on the tuxedo?

381
00:24:35,774 --> 00:24:37,742
Okay.

382
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,877
Here you go.

383
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,648
I think I'd prefer one
more like the one I rented.

384
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,514
<i>- That is the one you rented.
- Oh.</i>

385
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,612
I didn't realize it looked like this.
I guess it'll be all right.

386
00:24:51,723 --> 00:24:53,691
Thank you.

387
00:24:57,195 --> 00:25:00,164
You haven't seen this?
Detachable collar.

388
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:03,723
Not many people wear them anymore.
They look much better.

389
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:07,737
So many things which were better in the past
have been abandoned for supposed convenience.

390
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:12,435
- I had no idea anyone wore those anymore.
- It's a small thing, but symbolically important.

391
00:25:12,544 --> 00:25:15,445
Our parents' generation was never
interested in keeping up standards.

392
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:20,450
They wanted to be happy, but the last way
to be happy is to make it your objective in life.

393
00:25:20,552 --> 00:25:22,782
I wonder if our generation's
any better than our parents'.

394
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:27,791
Oh, it's far worse. Our generation's probably
the worst since the Protestant Reformation.

395
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:32,796
It's barbaric, but a barbarism even worse
than the old-fashioned, straightforward kind.

396
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:37,597
Now barbarism is cloaked with all sorts
of self-righteousness and moral superiority.

397
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,502
- Will you look at this?
- You're obviously talking about a lot more than just detachable collars.

398
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,971
Yeah, I am.

399
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:58,614
<i>Because he's obviously
not an interesting guy.</i>

400
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,123
Why is he so successful
with girls then?

401
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:04,923
Rick Von Sloneker is tall,
rich, good-looking...

402
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,260
stupid, dishonest, conceited...

403
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,266
a bully, liar, drunk and thief...

404
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:12,598
an egomaniac
and probably psychotic.

405
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:15,002
In short,
highly attractive to women.

406
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:18,234
You're completely unfair.
You don't know anything about Rick.

407
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,903
<i>- In fact, he's quite shy.
- God!</i>

408
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,912
He's a considerate and sensitive man.

409
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:25,983
The rest is just
a superficial game he plays, a façade...

410
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,984
which you've obviously
been taken in by.

411
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,453
It's incredible, the eagerness of girls like you
to justify the worst bastards imaginable...

412
00:26:31,556 --> 00:26:33,683
as being sensitive and shy.

413
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:36,693
But if any guy who really was shy
dared talk to you...

414
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,696
you wouldn't give him the time of day-
your eyes would glaze over.

415
00:26:39,798 --> 00:26:42,699
You're really hung up on Rick, aren't you?
He must really threaten you somehow.

416
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:44,701
You're right.
I do feel threatened...

417
00:26:44,803 --> 00:26:48,466
that I may get a venereal disease
from one of the St. Tim's girls he's been with.

418
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:53,135
Did you learn that
from your lovemaking with Rick?

419
00:26:53,244 --> 00:26:55,212
I hear it can get really rough.

420
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:58,282
- Hey!
- Don't do that again.

421
00:26:59,584 --> 00:27:01,677
For me, it isn't erotic.

422
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,322
- What are you looking at?
- My father's apartment.

423
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,360
<i>- Where?
- The fourth floor.</i>

424
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:13,397
<i>- Corner apartment.
- That's Kate Preston's building.</i>

425
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:16,262
Have your parents been divorced long?

426
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,268
The actual divorce
was three years ago...

427
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,271
but they were separated
for a year before that.

428
00:27:21,373 --> 00:27:24,672
- Do you see your father much?
- We have lunch when I'm in town.

429
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,904
- That's very little.
- No, actually we have a very good relationship.

430
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:30,914
Probably much better than most people
who see their father all the time.

431
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:34,179
It's just that my stepmother is a writer
and having us around makes her nervous.

432
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,888
I read that Lionel Trilling essay
you mentioned.

433
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:41,151
- You really like Trilling?
- Yes.

434
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,354
I think he's very strange.

435
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:48,091
<i>He says that nobody could like
the heroine of Mansfield Park.</i>

436
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,099
<i>I like her.</i>

437
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:54,194
Then he goes on and on about how we modern
people of today with our modern attitudes...

438
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:58,571
<i>bitterly resent Mansfield Park
because its heroine is virtuous?</i>

439
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:01,578
What's wrong with a novel
having a virtuous heroine?

440
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,580
His point is that the novel's premise -

441
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,083
that there's something immoral in a group of
young people putting on a play- is simply absurd.

442
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,210
You found Fanny Price unlikable?

443
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,754
She sounds pretty unbearable.
But I haven't read the book.

444
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,087
- What?
- You don't have to have read a book to have an opinion on it.

445
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,093
I haven't read the Bible either.

446
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,062
WhatJane Austen novels have you read?

447
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:22,065
None. I don't read novels.

448
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,067
I prefer good literary criticism.

449
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:27,070
That way, you get both the novelist's ideas
as well as the critic's thinking.

450
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,073
With fiction, I can never forget
that none of it ever really happened...

451
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,143
that it's all just made up
by the author.

452
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:39,039
<i>One thing I like about him is
he doesn't say all the expected things.</i>

453
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,051
He doesn't just agree with everything
everyone else is saying.

454
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:45,714
<i>That's true. He disagrees
with everything everyone else says.</i>

455
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,724
I'm not sure I prefer that.

456
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,023
He's quite good-looking though.
I think serious guys tend to be better-looking.

457
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,256
Ow!

458
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:10,005
The term "bourgeois" has almost always
been - been one of contempt.

459
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:15,018
Yet it is precisely the - the bourgeoisie
which is responsible for-

460
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,580
well, for nearly everything good that has happened
in our civilization over the past four centuries.

461
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:23,320
<i>You know the French film,
The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie?</i>

462
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,828
When I first heard that title I thought...

463
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,922
"Finally, someone's gonna tell the truth
about the bourgeoisie. "

464
00:29:29,033 --> 00:29:31,365
<i>What a disappointment.</i>

465
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:34,961
It would be hard to imagine
a less fair or accurate portrait.

466
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,973
Well, of course.
Buñuel's a surrealist.

467
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,169
<i>- Despising the bourgeoisie is part of their credo.
- Where do they get off?.</i>

468
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:44,180
<i>But the truth is,
the bourgeoisie does have a lot of charm.</i>

469
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,182
Of course it does.

470
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,878
The surrealists
were just a lot of social climbers.

471
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:50,682
Is there any more wine?

472
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:53,623
<i>I like the French.</i>

473
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,455
- Really?
- At least those I met in Grenoble.

474
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,088
Actually, the only girl I ever knew who studied
in France stayed over there and got married.

475
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,098
So I guess she liked the French too.

476
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,828
I'm not sure I like them that much.

477
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,549
<i>S.P.S., we used to call him.</i>

478
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:22,552
Never mind.

479
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,622
<i>Look.</i>

480
00:30:56,521 --> 00:31:00,048
- I think I'll visit the powder room.
- What really goes on in there?

481
00:31:00,158 --> 00:31:02,126
Oh, it's fabulous.

482
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,435
You seem to be in an awfully
good mood tonight, Townsend.

483
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,438
- Of course, you're in your element here.
- Are you kidding?

484
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,566
You're part of it all -
the whole Manhattan thing.

485
00:31:18,676 --> 00:31:20,576
It's different for those of us
from the country.

486
00:31:20,678 --> 00:31:23,579
- You're from Greenwich.
- North Greenwich.

487
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:26,241
- This is your world, not mine.
- Oh, come on.

488
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:30,412
You're part of that whole Sally Fowler crowd.
Doesn't get much more inside than that.

489
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,490
<i>Not that I particularly care.
I don't believe in those things.</i>

490
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:38,795
<i>- Oh, hi, Serena.
- Hi. Hi, Tom.</i>

491
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,127
- How's your brother?
- Fine.

492
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,532
<i>Tom, I think we should talk.</i>

493
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:50,935
I haven't been giving you the silent treatment.
I just haven't been talking to you.

494
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,010
Well, I felt it.

495
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,812
I love the St. Regis.

496
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,816
There's all sorts of
hidden nooks and crannies.

497
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,818
It's really charming.

498
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,388
Yes. They'll probably
knock it down soon.

499
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,298
It hardly explains why you just left me there
waiting for you to call...

500
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,302
without even a phone call
to explain why you didn't show up.

501
00:32:19,404 --> 00:32:23,431
I'm sorry it was such a bad time for you, but I don't
see how that should make me feel any better.

502
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:27,671
You don't? Well, it always
makes me feel better.

503
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:31,510
Well, it makes me feel somewhat better,
but it still doesn't change anything.

504
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,016
It shows that it wasn't intentional.

505
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,313
To me,
that's an important distinction.

506
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,697
Things are definitely over with Rick.

507
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,971
With some relationships,
the breaking up is easier to understand...

508
00:32:55,073 --> 00:32:58,042
than how you got involved
in the first place.

509
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,379
Do you think I'd have
any trouble getting a cab?

510
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:06,211
- You're going already?
- Yes. I'm exhausted.

511
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:10,083
My mother's doctor's been giving me these
vitamin shots. They've worn off or something.

512
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,030
Oh, Fred, something's come up
and I've got to go out for a while.

513
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:24,226
<i>Would you tell Audrey I should be back soon,
but if there's any problem I'll meet her at Sally's?</i>

514
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,236
<i>Should I not get back,
could you see that she gets there okay?</i>

515
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,909
Thought I was gonna puke.

516
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:43,619
I had hardly anything to drink.

517
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:47,680
It must have been something I ate -
those Vienna sausages.

518
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,608
Actually, I was surprised to see you
at the dances this week.

519
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:08,543
You used to be so opposed
to that sort of thing.

520
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:10,546
I still am, basically.

521
00:34:10,648 --> 00:34:13,208
I went to the first one almost accidentally
and that night just happened to fall in...

522
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:15,217
with an extraordinarily nice
group of people.

523
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,219
Otherwise I wouldn't have
gone to any more.

524
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,950
I'd hardly call Nick Smith nice.
He's a terrible snob.

525
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,721
He's basically a nice guy, I think.

526
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,989
His behavior toward Rick
has been vicious.

527
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:28,588
What did he do?

528
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,499
Tried to make a big stink about some girl.
Rick didn't want to talk about it.

529
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,571
Apparently it was awful.

530
00:34:36,174 --> 00:34:38,335
Rick thinks Nick
could be really crazy.

531
00:34:38,443 --> 00:34:41,139
I'm just worried
that something's happened to him.

532
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,146
I don't see how - how anything
could happen to him in a hotel.

533
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,648
Maybe it was the same thing
that happened to Fred.

534
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,151
Tom hasn't had much experience
in places like these.

535
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:53,155
Maybe he went through one of those fire doors that
lock from the inside and shut himself in the stairwell.

536
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:56,658
The fire stairs here aren't like that. I've had to use them
when people have forgotten to invite me to their parties.

537
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,991
I've never had any trouble.

538
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,497
I just don't understand
where he could be.

539
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,598
Well, that - that's interesting...

540
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:10,606
because actually there's very little
social snobbery in the United States.

541
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:12,608
I mean, it's considered unacceptable.

542
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:15,008
There's almost
a national taboo against it.

543
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,014
- It's looked down upon.
- That's good, isn't it?

544
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:21,017
No, I'm not talking about
what's good or bad.

545
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,519
I'm just making
a- a-an observation of fact.

546
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,521
<i>Well, I think it is good.</i>

547
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:28,751
I can't stand snobbery
or snobbish attitudes of any kind.

548
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,921
<i>Could you see who's there?</i>

549
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:41,070
<i>- Sorry to be so late.
- Where were you?</i>

550
00:35:41,172 --> 00:35:43,538
- Didn't Fred tell you?
- Tell us what?

551
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,542
The only thing we heard from Fred was -

552
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,545
- Fred left ages ago.
- God, Audrey, I'm sorry.

553
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:52,548
- Why?
- I asked Fred to tell you if I didn't get back-

554
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,618
Don't worry.
It's nothing.

555
00:35:56,354 --> 00:35:59,255
- Well, where were you?
- I had to take Serena home.

556
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:02,326
She was feeling badly
and she was going to go home alone.

557
00:36:09,033 --> 00:36:12,491
She's broken up with Rick.
It just took longer than I expected.

558
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:15,504
I asked Fred to tell you that if I didn't
make it back, I'd meet you here.

559
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:19,007
- We didn't get that message.
- We thought you'd gotten trapped somewhere in the hotel.

560
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:21,670
<i>- Audrey was very concerned.
- I'm very sorry.</i>

561
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,747
You sound very sorry.

562
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:29,384
I find it very hard to believe
that Serena broke up with Rick.

563
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,455
It was probably the other way around.

564
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:39,890
I'm worried about Audrey.
She seems to have taken this so hard.

565
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,897
I'm a bit surprised.

566
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:44,832
I had no idea
Fred was gonna get sick.

567
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,097
You know, where -
where do you get off?

568
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,105
I mean, you're surprised?

569
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:53,610
You were Audrey's escort, yet you blithely
left her stranded in the middle of the dance.

570
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:56,111
And then you try to
shirk the whole thing off on Fred.

571
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,115
I was not trying to shirk
the whole thing off on Fred.

572
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:02,118
And I wasn't even Audrey's escort.
We were all there as a group.

573
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,882
- In any case, I'm very sorry there was a mix-up.
- There was no mix-up.

574
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,388
Well, it wasn't intentional.

575
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:10,324
When you're an egoist,
none of the harm you do is intentional.

576
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,630
You're going already?

577
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,132
- Yes. I'm really tired.
- Just a second. I'll get my coat.

578
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,135
No, that's okay.
Charlie said he'd take me.

579
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,137
- I'd like to.
- No, really.

580
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,139
Don't bother.

581
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,641
Listen, I'm really sorry
about what happened tonight.

582
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:28,644
- I thought I'd be back much more quickly.
- It's not important.

583
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,646
- Thank you very much.
- Oh, good night.

584
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,239
- You ready?
- Good night.

585
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,253
- Good night, Audrey.
- Feel better.

586
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:40,689
I never thought of myself
as a bastard, an egoist.

587
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,691
Listen, don't flatter yourself.

588
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,694
<i>Charlie's standard of polite behavior
is so exaggerated.</i>

589
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,697
At school he used to
individually answer all his junk mail.

590
00:37:48,799 --> 00:37:52,360
I suppose he thought someone's feelings
would be hurt if he didn't.

591
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,770
I like him a lot, but don't try to
understand his thought processes.

592
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:58,774
The summer I met him -
We were 10-

593
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:02,937
he was trying to establish communications
with the seagulls of Easthampton.

594
00:38:03,047 --> 00:38:05,948
It was utterly hopeless.
The Easthampton seagulls are complete morons.

595
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:08,951
We still spent several afternoons
approaching shore birds, saying...

596
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:10,953
"We come in friendship. "

597
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:14,957
They could not have cared less - much like
his efforts with girls in recent years.

598
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,687
Great. I'm hated
by the preppy St. Francis.

599
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,695
I wouldn't worry about it.

600
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,197
That's the building
where my father lives.

601
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,928
- Do you know Kate Preston? She lives there.
- No.

602
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,704
Will you look at this?

603
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:32,207
It's incredible,
the things some people throw away.

604
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,677
Steiff stuffed animals.
An Aurora model motoring set.

605
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:38,078
A Derringer.
Do you remember the Derringer craze?

606
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,483
These are the toys of our generation.

607
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:44,486
The childhood of our whole generation
is represented here...

608
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:47,216
and they're just throwing it out.

609
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:50,226
Maybe we should rescue
the electric car set.

610
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:52,455
Could really add
to these after-parties.

611
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,898
- Uh, I turn here.
- Oh. See you tonight.

612
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,996
Listen, don't take this thing
with Charlie too seriously.

613
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:05,075
No. See you tonight.

614
00:39:15,653 --> 00:39:20,181
My feeling is that what happened last night
had no real significance.

615
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:22,725
It was just bad luck
that Fred got sick.

616
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,795
I can't believe
you're talking like this.

617
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:27,295
He totally humiliated you last night.

618
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:31,494
Whether I've been humiliated or not
is something I can judge for myself.

619
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:34,196
Besides, I don't think Tom's that way.

620
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:37,468
<i>Well, I'm not sure
you can judge for yourself.</i>

621
00:39:37,575 --> 00:39:39,475
Be careful, Audrey.

622
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,477
- There's something dubious about Tom.
- What?

623
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:44,810
This whole thing about his being a radical
when he's obviously not...

624
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,816
<i>and being over Serena
when he's obviously not.</i>

625
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,284
Everyone has some contradictions.

626
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,288
Anybody with
as many conflicts as Tom...

627
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,881
even if he seems nice,
is better not to get involved with.

628
00:39:54,992 --> 00:39:57,392
By those standards,
none of us should get involved with anyone.

629
00:39:57,495 --> 00:39:59,554
<i>Well,you're probably right,
but in this case certainly.</i>

630
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,793
Tom is the only guy I've ever liked
in my whole life.

631
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,632
I'm not gonna forget about him
because of some apparent inconsistencies.

632
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:11,139
- You hardly even know him.
- I know him very well.

633
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,574
You couldn't.
You only just met him.

634
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:16,145
Well, I do.

635
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,678
I didn't know
you sent out Christmas cards.

636
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:25,688
Well, I haven't in years.

637
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:29,351
When we moved, do you know what happened
to my toys and things?

638
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,796
They were put in storage.

639
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:36,128
Do you think some of them
could have been sent to Dad's?

640
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,793
It's possible.
Why? Do you want them?

641
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:42,805
- You're a bit old for that sort of thing.
- No, I just had a feeling they went to Dad's.

642
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:46,536
<i>- Well, why don't you call him then?
- I have. There's been no answer.</i>

643
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,654
There's something about winter in the city
at night, with everyone dressed up...

644
00:40:58,756 --> 00:41:00,656
<i>that reminds me of War and Peace.</i>

645
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,658
- Really?
- Do you know what I mean?

646
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,059
Yeah, I think so,
though I haven't read it.

647
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,738
Well, I don't think "preppy"
is a very useful term.

648
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,037
I mean, it might be descriptive for
someone who is still in school or college...

649
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:24,046
but it's ridiculous to refer to a man in his 7 Os,
like Averell Harriman, as a preppy.

650
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:28,847
And none of the other terms people use -
WASP, P.L.U., et cetera - are of much use either.

651
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:32,081
And that's why
I prefer the term "U.H.B."

652
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:34,384
- What?
- U.H.B.

653
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,552
It's an acronym for
urban haute bourgeoisie.

654
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,754
Is our language so impoverished...

655
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:43,231
that we have to use acronyms or French phrases
to make ourselves understood?

656
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,235
- Yes.
- U.H.B.

657
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:49,568
The term is brilliant
and long overdue.

658
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,574
But it's a bit of a mouthful, isn't it -
U.H.B.?

659
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:57,204
Wouldn't it be better
just to pronounce it simply "UHB"?

660
00:41:57,314 --> 00:42:00,215
Well, I didn't expect it
to gain immediate acceptance.

661
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:04,378
No, no, I think it's a useful term. The fact that
it sounds ridiculous could be part of its appeal.

662
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:06,888
You see the world from such lofty heights...

663
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:09,960
that everything below
is a bit comical to you, isn't it?

664
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,663
- Yes.
- You're so obnoxious.

665
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:18,567
I don't see how you can stand him.

666
00:42:18,669 --> 00:42:21,832
You're always complaining about people
being frauds and phonies.

667
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:24,339
Well, this guy is
the phony of the decade...

668
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:27,342
yet you act like
he was your long-lost best friend.

669
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:31,346
Tom Townsend is hardly a phony-
just mildly deluded. He's a perfectly nice guy.

670
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,906
That's just another aspect of his phoniness.
He's a complete phony.

671
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,920
And when he's not being a phony,
h- he's a bastard.

672
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:39,922
Oh, come on.

673
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,925
- You saw how he treated Audrey last night.
- Audrey seems to have forgotten it.

674
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:47,430
She has to act that way.
Otherwise, it would be even more humiliating.

675
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:50,932
But I don't have to pretend
that Tom Townsend's a nice guy.

676
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,004
You're really gaga about Audrey,
aren't you?

677
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,665
Well, if by "gaga"
you mean, "Do I like her?"...

678
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,675
yeah.

679
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,177
Well, why don't you
do something about it then...

680
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:05,180
instead of just going on and on
about what a bastard Tom Townsend is.

681
00:43:05,282 --> 00:43:08,843
What am I supposed to do? Declare myself?
That would be an absolute disaster.

682
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:11,854
And don't think
I haven't thought about these things.

683
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,853
Yes, Rick and Serena broke up.

684
00:43:13,958 --> 00:43:17,189
But this afternoon they both went down
to Washington for Holly Gilchrist's party.

685
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:20,195
It was Holly who was responsible
for getting them together in the first place.

686
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:22,765
<i>- Oh, so she was responsible.
- They went together?</i>

687
00:43:22,866 --> 00:43:25,699
<i>They went separately.
How they'll come back-</i>

688
00:43:25,803 --> 00:43:28,363
I don't think that Rick is the sort of guy
who lets himself be dropped.

689
00:43:28,472 --> 00:43:31,270
- Ha!
- What is that supposed to mean?

690
00:43:31,375 --> 00:43:33,206
Ha!

691
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,210
Rick really threatens you somehow.

692
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:37,212
How does he threaten me?

693
00:43:37,314 --> 00:43:40,181
Maybe by being
more of a man than you are.

694
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,878
<i>- You stupid slut.
- Oh, come on.!</i>

695
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:45,046
What has Rick done
that's so terrible?

696
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:47,055
<i>He is terrible.</i>

697
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,887
I shouldn't have to go into
all the sordid details.

698
00:43:49,994 --> 00:43:52,121
Could you go into
a few sordid details?

699
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:55,130
I don't think there are any reasons,
except for maybe jealousy.

700
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,962
Rick makes him feel
terribly inadequate somehow.

701
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:02,027
Okay, I'll tell you
about Rick Von Sloneker.

702
00:44:06,176 --> 00:44:09,373
Does the name Polly Perkins
mean anything to you?

703
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,243
Sounds familiar.

704
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:14,249
She grew up in Virginia.

705
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:16,251
A horse fanatic since childhood.

706
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,652
Went to one of those horsey girls schools -
Garrison Forest, I think.

707
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,885
Sometime in her senior year
she started feeling depressed.

708
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:25,985
Now, partly it was finally
becoming disillusioned with horses.

709
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:29,998
But there were some
real psychological problems too.

710
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:34,002
That summer she got a job in Edgartown
and seemed completely recovered...

711
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,005
except for a couple of idiosyncrasies -
she'd only dress in blue...

712
00:44:37,107 --> 00:44:40,008
and she wouldn't eat hamburgers
unless they were completely well done.

713
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,011
<i>Any hint of redness
and she'd send them back.</i>

714
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,947
Out of loyalty to her boyfriend
in Virginia...

715
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:50,020
she'd only go on group dates,
never individual ones.

716
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:55,217
Von Sloneker met her when
he came to Edgartown for the regatta.

717
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,927
She showed
no interest in him at all initially...

718
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:02,396
which makes sense because
he's a completely uninteresting guy.

719
00:45:02,499 --> 00:45:05,024
But for someone like Von Sloneker,
that's just inciting.

720
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:08,036
So he swung into action
with a full rigamarole...

721
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,663
about how desperately
in love he was with her...

722
00:45:10,774 --> 00:45:13,800
how she was the first girl
that ever made him feel that way...

723
00:45:13,911 --> 00:45:15,742
<i>how it was their obligation
to themselves...</i>

724
00:45:15,846 --> 00:45:18,314
<i>to do everything they could
to live life to the fullest.</i>

725
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:23,011
Polly had, meanwhile, quit her summer job
and joined his boat for the rest of the cruise.

726
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,020
He now completely ignored her.

727
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,590
She, in turn,
became obsessed with him.

728
00:45:29,193 --> 00:45:32,458
Polly was a bit of a masochist
and prone to drink too much.

729
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:37,194
Von Sloneker exploited this
to get her drunk...

730
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,201
and had her-

731
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:42,033
Do you know what
"pulling a train" means?

732
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:45,166
I don't think so.

733
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,312
When Von Sloneker had gotten her
blind drunk one night...

734
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,314
he talked her into pulling a train -

735
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,611
him, Victor Lemley,
the other crew member.

736
00:45:56,386 --> 00:46:00,550
When she arrived at Wheaton for her first
semester, she was acting very strangely...

737
00:46:00,657 --> 00:46:02,921
always wearing the same clothes...

738
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:06,928
never washing, except just putting on
more and more makeup and perfume.

739
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,930
She'd remain silent for hours...

740
00:46:09,032 --> 00:46:11,330
and then talk obsessively
about Paul McCartney.

741
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:16,204
After two weeks,
she was sent to McLean's for treatment...

742
00:46:16,306 --> 00:46:19,207
but was able to go home
to Virginia for Thanksgiving.

743
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:22,210
The day after Thanksgiving,
she went into their stables...

744
00:46:22,312 --> 00:46:24,439
and killed herself.

745
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:27,813
I've heard about that girl,
and it wasn't Rick's fault.

746
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:30,853
She was just some girl who had a crush on him,
but whom he hardly knew.

747
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:35,789
She'd always had psychological problems
and was, in fact, a pathological liar.

748
00:46:35,893 --> 00:46:39,090
It was very sad what happened,
but Rick had absolutely nothing to do with it.

749
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,164
<i>I don't know.</i>

750
00:46:42,332 --> 00:46:45,028
She was carrying his photo
when she killed herself.

751
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:47,569
That doesn't mean anything.

752
00:46:48,605 --> 00:46:50,664
- What an appalling story.
- Yep.

753
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:52,674
Not many people could know about it.

754
00:46:52,776 --> 00:46:55,176
Von Sloneker could hardly
show his face around here.

755
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,180
- You really showed up Cynthia. Whew.
- Yeah.

756
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:00,409
That's what made it
worthwhile for me.

757
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:02,417
What do you mean?

758
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:04,680
- There is no Polly Perkins.
- What?

759
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:07,916
- There's no girl. I made it up.
- You're kidding!

760
00:47:08,025 --> 00:47:11,517
I couldn't let Cynthia get away
with that nonsense about Von Sloneker.

761
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:16,531
And basically it's all true. I mean, Von Sloneker's
doing those kinds of things all the time.

762
00:47:16,633 --> 00:47:19,727
Though Polly Perkins is,
essentially, a composite...

763
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,738
<i>based on real people,
like New York magazine does.</i>

764
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,072
- But Cynthia said she knew all about her.
- Yeah. That was priceless.

765
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,738
I think it just shows that Von Sloneker's
doing those sorts of things.

766
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:33,749
But you really do have some factual basis
for saying all those things about him?

767
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,149
Of course, there's a factual basis.

768
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:52,558
# In keeping their sheep #

769
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:55,900
<i>? On a cold winter's night?</i>

770
00:47:56,006 --> 00:47:58,133
<i>? That was so deep?</i>

771
00:47:58,242 --> 00:48:00,142
<i>Excuse me.</i>

772
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:04,146
<i>By any chance, would you have any book
on the French social philosopher Fourier?</i>

773
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,784
I can tell he's still
obsessed with Serena.

774
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,413
You're actually much better off not being
involved with a guy who's clearly so mixed-up.

775
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:15,980
<i>There's not gonna be good news
for anyone for a long time.</i>

776
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:23,832
<i>?Dry your eyes?</i>

777
00:48:23,934 --> 00:48:26,164
<i>? There's no need to?</i>

778
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:31,139
<i>? Cry?</i>

779
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,438
<i>?I am so sorry, but?</i>

780
00:48:35,545 --> 00:48:38,013
<i>?Bye-bye?</i>

781
00:48:38,115 --> 00:48:40,140
<i>?So long?</i>

782
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:46,516
<i>?Mother's gotta go now?</i>

783
00:48:46,623 --> 00:48:50,855
<i>?La-la-la, la-la-la?</i>

784
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:55,854
<i>?I?</i>

785
00:48:55,966 --> 00:48:59,026
<i>?I am so sorry to?</i>

786
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,972
<i>?See you cry?</i>

787
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:06,838
<i>? Wipe those tears from your-?</i>

788
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,242
<i>- Hi, Audrey.
- Hi.!</i>

789
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:12,315
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

790
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,816
Oh, I was talking with Tom Townsend
the other night.

791
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,943
- He spoke very highly of you.
- Really?

792
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:22,959
Yes, he - he said
you were very... well-read.

793
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:30,864
# O come, all ye faithful #

794
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:35,769

Um,Jane? Are you familiar
with Dr. Pomeroy's work?

806
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:55,314
Who?

807
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:59,185
<i>Girls And Sex by Wardell B. Pomeroy.</i>

00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:04,455
"The long-needed modern guide
to the understanding of girls growing up. "

809
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:08,793
<i>Quote: "'The most frank and objective
book currently available. ' LibraryJournal. "</i>

810
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,094
Oh, that.

811
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:15,865
"The years of puberty and early womanhood
are difficult, even frightening, for many girls.

812
00:51:15,972 --> 00:51:19,100
"This is the time they most need
objective, factual information...

813
00:51:19,209 --> 00:51:23,009
and sympathetic advice about
their physical and emotional changes. "

814
00:51:23,113 --> 00:51:26,014
You know, we don't have enough for two tables.
There's only seven of us.

815
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,914
- That's impossible.
- Tom's not here yet.

816
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,850
Is he coming?

817
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:34,651
<i>Sure. He is coming, isn't he?</i>

818
00:51:35,792 --> 00:51:38,989
- You didn't call him?
- I thought there were eight of us. He would have been the ninth.

819
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:42,156
- You told me that he - - Well,just call him
up. I'm sure he isn't doing anything else.

820
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:45,564
Well, surely there's - there's someone else
in New York who can play bridge...

821
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:47,694
other than Tom Townsend.

822
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:49,772
I mean, you know, seven can play.

823
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:52,000
What have you got against Tom?

824
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:54,737
Just one thing -
He's not - not a good person.

825
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,507
- Oh, what nonsense.
- Oh, all right. Go ahead.

826
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,548
Call him if you want.
I don't care.

827
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:03,176
Actually, I don't think Tom approves of bridge,
but we should ask him anyway.

828
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:10,426
Well, have a seat.

829
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:14,453
Then just say you pass.

830
00:52:14,564 --> 00:52:16,464
I pass.

831
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:21,226
I couldn't believe you were actually going to
play bridge. It's such a cliché of bourgeois life.

832
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:24,774
That's exactly why I play.
I don't enjoy it one bit.

833
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:28,243
I intended to go
and got as far as the door.

834
00:52:28,345 --> 00:52:31,143
- What happened?
- My mother got upset.

835
00:52:31,248 --> 00:52:33,546
She said that she couldn't face
being alone on Christmas Eve...

836
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:36,881
and that it was really important
that the family be together then.

837
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:39,455
My brother never comes home
at Christmas anymore.

838
00:52:39,556 --> 00:52:43,549
So, anyway, I just stayed and had a traditional
Christmas with Channel 11 's traditional yule log.

839
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:46,390
Oh, yeah. I think I've seen that.

840
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:50,398
<i>Noon on Christmas Day, every other year,
we go to my father's place.</i>

841
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:54,596
I was a bit reluctant to go this year, actually, because
I hadn't been able to get in touch with my father all week.

842
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:57,400
But my mother insisted.
It was a real nightmare.

843
00:52:57,507 --> 00:52:59,975
First, the doorman at my father's building
wouldn't let me up.

844
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,375
I guess he didn't remember me there
from Christmas two years ago.

845
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,607
Then there was
some confusion and whispering...

846
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:09,708
and, finally, they gave me a piece of paper
with a Santa Fe, New Mexico address on it.

847
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:13,755
They told me he'd moved to Santa Fe.
I couldn't believe it.

848
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,849
<i>They took me up to the apartment,
and except for some paper and litter...</i>

849
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:20,828
<i>and wire coat hangers lying around,
it was completely empty.</i>

850
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,695
He hadn't told me
anything about moving.

851
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,598
It was quite a surprise.

852
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:30,002
That's awful.
There must be some explanation.

853
00:53:30,106 --> 00:53:32,870
He must have written you or something,
and the letter got delayed.

854
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:35,604
<i>I don't know.</i>

855
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,805
And you had such a good relationship.

856
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:42,283
In retrospect, I wonder how good it was.
I hadn't seen him since last spring.

857
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,649
Maybe I was just kidding myself.

858
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,923
<i>Oh, I've been reading Jane Austen.
Persuasion.</i>

859
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,995
<i>I like it. I was surprised.</i>

860
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,081
The titled aristocracy
are the scum of the Earth.

861
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:15,981
What really makes me furious
is that you have a whole class of people-

862
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,919
mostly Europeans-
all looking down at me.

863
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:22,958
You always say "titled aristocrats. "
What about untitled aristocrats?

864
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,789
I couldn't very well despise them,
could I?

865
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,762
That would be self-hatred,
which is unhealthy.

866
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,799
You're so conceited.

867
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:33,869
Well, saying that the titled aristocracy
are the scum of the Earth...

868
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:36,837
is -well, is obviously
an exaggeration.

869
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,239
<i>But - But it's true that the forces
that oblige members of the U.H.B...</i>

870
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,904
to at least appear to act
productively and responsibly...

871
00:54:44,014 --> 00:54:45,982
carries little weight,
or none at all...

872
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:49,848
with members of society whose social positions
are secure no matter what they do.

873
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,925
So you had a trust fund?
The pieces are beginning to fall into place.

874
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:01,497
I don't have one anymore.

875
00:55:01,598 --> 00:55:03,566
Well, that's less important.

876
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:07,660
I mean, so-so - sociologically,
I mean, what's important is...

877
00:55:07,771 --> 00:55:10,604
having grown up with the assumption
of material security.

878
00:55:10,707 --> 00:55:13,369
It - It explains a lot.

879
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,376
I call.

880
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,780
I had no cards.
Why did you call?

881
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,146
I felt like it.

882
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:24,709
Playing strip poker with an exhibitionist
somehow takes the challenge away.

883
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:33,961
His name is Frank Goodrich.
He handles some financial things for my father.

884
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:37,431
Actually, it's a tremendous relief,
not having that hanging over my head anymore.

885
00:55:37,534 --> 00:55:39,434
Really?

886
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:42,505
There was a big load of guilt that went with it,
even though it wasn't that much money...

887
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,233
and I never really counted
on having it.

888
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,108
You're a tragic case. You've just been robbed,
and it's a great relief to you.

889
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:51,180
In part, regarding the money.

890
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:54,409
Regarding my relationship with my father,
of course I'm concerned.

891
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,508
He moves to another state
without telling me...

892
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:58,587
he doesn't write or call me
for over a month...

893
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,156
and basically has me disinherited.

894
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:05,353
- Obviously, our relationship is not what I thought it was.
- Geez.

895
00:56:05,462 --> 00:56:09,922
It's as if he were incredibly angry with me,
but I can't think of why.

896
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,558
- I don't know what it could be.
- You don't?

897
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,296
No.

898
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:19,740
One word - "stepmother. "

899
00:56:22,278 --> 00:56:25,543
Well, I hope I can talk to them
and straighten things out.

900
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:29,880
<i>I'm sure nothing you did or said
has anything to do with it...</i>

901
00:56:29,986 --> 00:56:33,422
and nothing you say or do
will change anything.

902
00:56:33,523 --> 00:56:36,185
- That's awfully pessimistic.
- It's the way things are.

903
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:40,025
The most important thing
to realize about parents...

904
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:42,997
is that there's absolutely nothing
you can do about them.

905
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:46,999
You look terrific.

906
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,003
You like it?

907
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,630
- This is really decadent.
- This is nothing.

908
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:11,327
- Something's happened to Nick.
- It's my head.

909
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:14,591
<i>- It's my head. It's my head.
- What's happened?</i>

910
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:17,165
There was this guy at school
Nick liked to imitate saying this.

911
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:20,100
He had taken mescaline, and he
went around doing this about his head.

912
00:57:20,203 --> 00:57:22,933
- It's my head. It's my head.
- "It's my head. "

913
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:27,169
- Nick took mescaline?
- No. I mean, it was the other guy, Voss.

914
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:29,802
- We did take mescaline.
- You what?

915
00:57:29,913 --> 00:57:32,973
He shouldn't be reacting this way though.
I don't know what happened.

916
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:34,982
It was really mild.

917
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:38,354
Are you joking?

918
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,193
It's called Truth.

919
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:48,560
You stretch a Kleenex over the mouth
of a glass and place a dime on it.

920
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,395
We each take turns
burning a hole in it with a cigarette.

921
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:54,436
If the dime falls in on your turn,
you lose...

922
00:57:54,537 --> 00:57:57,165
and you have to answer,
with absolute honesty...

923
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,731
whatever question you're asked,
no matter how embarrassing.

924
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,508
Yeah. The more embarrassing,
the better.

925
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,580
What are you reading?

926
00:58:12,689 --> 00:58:14,657
<i>The Story of Babar.</i>

927
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,527
I forgot how beautiful it was.

928
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:22,896
Sometimes you can find out
the most amazing things.

929
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,899
It can really be incredible.

930
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,767
- I don't think we should play this.
- Why not?

931
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:32,535
There are good reasons why people don't go around
telling each other their most intimate thoughts.

932
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:34,542
What do you have to hide?

933
00:58:34,644 --> 00:58:37,613
No, I just know that games like this
can be really dangerous.

934
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:40,239
- Dangerous?
- I don't see what's dangerous about it.

935
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:45,117
You don't have to. Other people have.
That's how it became a convention.

936
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,781
People saw the harm
that excessive candor can do.

937
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,519
You admit that it's basically
just a social convention then.

938
00:58:50,627 --> 00:58:53,187
What you say might be true among people
who don't know each other well...

939
00:58:53,296 --> 00:58:55,196
<i>but surely not with us.</i>

940
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:59,200
<i>- Then it's even worse.
- Okay. Let's discuss this.</i>

941
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:02,328
Basically, what this game requires
is complete candor...

942
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,963
which means honesty, openness.

943
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,201
I don't see how that can be bad.

944
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,073
Well, it can.

945
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:12,204
Well, then don't play,
but don't wreck it for everyone else.

946
00:59:12,315 --> 00:59:15,716
No, if we're going to play, we all should.
That's the whole point.

947
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:19,845
I think if one of us isn't going to play,
then none of us should.

948
00:59:19,956 --> 00:59:24,586
- I mean, maybe Audrey's right.
- Come on. Let's not disagree.

949
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,162
You're really both saying
the same thing -

950
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,322
Either we should all play
or none of us should.

951
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,401
Well, it's really all up to Audrey then.

952
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:39,339
- Well, this isn't fair. If Audrey doesn't -
- No. Go ahead. I'll play.

953
01:00:00,296 --> 01:00:04,096
- What now?
- You get to ask me the most embarrassing question you can think of.

954
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:07,169
- I'm supposed to ask you the most
embarrassing question I can think of? - Uh-huh.

955
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,795
What's the most embarrassing thing
that's ever happened to you?

956
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:11,874
<i>No, something specific.</i>

957
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:16,278
<i>Like who was your most recent conquest?
Something like that.</i>

958
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:19,837
- Who was your most recent conquest?
- You mean, who did I sleep with last?

959
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,417
- You don't have to answer that.
- No, it's okay. I'm not embarrassed.

960
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:25,282
I have nothing to hide.
It was Nick.

961
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,814
After all that
about what a slut she was.

962
01:00:28,925 --> 01:00:31,689
But a very attractive slut.

963
01:00:31,794 --> 01:00:35,252
<i>So,you'rejust another hypocrite.</i>

964
01:00:35,365 --> 01:00:38,459
<i>That's not hypocrisy. It's sin.</i>

965
01:00:38,568 --> 01:00:40,536
It was hardly that.

966
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,248
Oh!

967
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:56,250
I have a question.

968
01:00:56,352 --> 01:00:58,684
With absolute honesty and frankness...

969
01:00:58,788 --> 01:01:01,256
list all the girls you're
interested in romantically...

970
01:01:01,357 --> 01:01:05,919
in descending order of interest, and why,
including significant detail.

971
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:09,130
I thought that was pretty obvious.

972
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:12,599
I've had a crush on Serena,
with some ups and downs, for over two years.

973
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:16,103
Recently it seems to have developed
into something more serious.

974
01:01:16,205 --> 01:01:18,867
But who else do you like romantically?

975
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,144
I don't think it works that way.

976
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:25,646
If you're really interested in one person,
you're not interested in anyone else.

977
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:28,012
I suppose it's possible,
but what's the point?

978
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:31,348
But if that doesn't work out,
there must be someone else.

979
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:36,619
If it doesn't work out this time,
I'll be off romance for a long time.

980
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,423
I suppose this is embarrassing,
but it's hardly a revelation.

981
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,234
I'm sorry I asked him that.
It was my fault.

982
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:56,271
I always think other people are foolish.
I'm the big fool.

983
01:02:00,016 --> 01:02:04,419
It's better for her to know the truth. I don't see
how knowing the truth could do anyone any harm.

984
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,045
It's not just the truth.
It's how and when you learn it.

985
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,124
I don't accept that.

986
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,188
I mean, you -
you were right about that game.

987
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,560
It's terrible.

988
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:19,863
You know, you may not realize it, Audrey,
but everyone li - likes you a lot.

989
01:02:19,969 --> 01:02:22,767
Thank you, but I find that
very hard to believe.

990
01:02:22,872 --> 01:02:25,272
It's the truth.

991
01:02:25,374 --> 01:02:29,743
And it's not just because
you're smart and good-looking and -

992
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:33,509
and charming and have principles.

993
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:37,575
<i>It's because they can see that-
that you're a good person.</i>

994
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,155
If you want to tease me,
this is not the best time.

995
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,692
<i>I mean, maybe this isn't the best time,
but for some time now, I-</i>

996
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:47,955
Well, I like you very much.

997
01:02:48,064 --> 01:02:50,692
I mean, I-I know that
you don't yet feel that way, but -

998
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,768
No, please. Stop.

999
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:04,602
Doesn't Serena look awful here?
She's not exactly photogenic.

1000
01:03:04,714 --> 01:03:06,682
There's one of you and Tom.

1001
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,343
There it is.

1002
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:22,060
- Maybe Cynthia's right.
- That's impossible.

1003
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,499
Her essential view is experience is good,
and she's set out to acquire it.

1004
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,799
I've been just the opposite.
Everything's been in my imagination.

1005
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:32,136
All the romance imaginary,
nothing real.

1006
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,766
- She's a slut.
- That's what Nick says.

1007
01:03:34,877 --> 01:03:37,209
- He proved it.
- That's unfair.

1008
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,213
I don't think so.

1009
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,714
I'm catching the dawn train upstate
to East Aurora.

1010
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:46,789
My father's place.

1011
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,187
It's the first time
they've invited me in years.

1012
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:53,422
I can't help wondering why my stepmother's
suddenly so willing to have me come.

1013
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,901
If I should die while there, would you see
that there's a thorough investigation...

1014
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:03,802
even if it looks like an accident
or natural causes?

1015
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,704
- Would you promise me that?
- Yes.

1016
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:12,937
Even if I do return alive, I don't think I'll be
attending any more dances after this one.

1017
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:16,746
With everything that's going on, this is
probably the last deb season as we know it.

1018
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:19,321
I don't want to just hang around,
watching the decline.

1019
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:22,118
- Everyone's going tonight?
- No. Just me.

1020
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:27,094
The International
is an inorganic debutante ball.

1021
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:30,097
The others were natural outgrowths
of local UHB formations.

1022
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:32,827
This was assembled
like a tourist attraction.

1023
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,332
Each girl has two escorts -

1024
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:40,375
one, a cadet in uniform
from one of the service academies...

1025
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,944
the other a civilian like myself.

1026
01:04:43,045 --> 01:04:45,377
<i>And the whole thing's televised
on Channel 9.</i>

1027
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:48,678
- You're kidding.
- No.

1028
01:04:48,784 --> 01:04:51,514
I guess you could say
it's extremely vulgar.

1029
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:54,249
I like it a lot.

1030
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:58,020
And these Texas and Oklahoma debs
are really nice...

1031
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:01,927
a real relief from
these hypercritical New York girls.

1032
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,555
What's everyone else doing then?

1033
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:07,430
I imagine they'll be glued
to the set.

1034
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:10,937
<i>Male Announcer ]
From the state of Texas, Miss Sabina Johnston...</i>

1035
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,668
daughter of
Mr. and Mrs. RoderickJohnston.

1036
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:16,745
- She's cute.
- But what about the dress?

1037
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:19,974
Nick said he thought this would be
the last real deb season.

1038
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:23,540
- How come?
- Because of everything going on.

1039
01:05:23,653 --> 01:05:27,851
- Like what?
- Well, everything.

1040
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:33,652
The stock market, the economy,
c- contemporary social attitudes.

1041
01:05:33,763 --> 01:05:36,493
Is Audrey coming tonight?

1042
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,067
She said she felt tired
and thought she'd stay at home.

1043
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:42,535
She can watch Channel 9
equally well from there.

1044
01:05:42,638 --> 01:05:45,163
<i>Announcer ] From the state of
Kentucky- - [ Intercom Buzzes ]</i>

1045
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,242
<i>- I'll get it.
- Thanks.</i>

1046
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,049
<i>Band ]
- [ Man ] Miss McLean, Mr. Von Sloneker coming up.</i>

1047
01:05:56,686 --> 01:06:00,122
Um, Cynthia's coming up
with-with Rick Von Sloneker.

1048
01:06:00,222 --> 01:06:02,952
- Oh, she mentioned they might come by.
- What would Nick say?

1049
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:06,358
What Nick says or thinks
I couldn't care less.

1050
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,926
I'll get it.

1051
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:17,369
See you. Hi! Hi!

1052
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:21,068
This is Rick Von Sloneker
and Victor Lemley.

1053
01:06:21,177 --> 01:06:24,203
- Tom Townsend.
- I've heard a lot about you.

1054
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:28,909
Of course you have.
So, who was talking about me?

1055
01:06:29,018 --> 01:06:32,613
- Nick Smith?
- Yes, actually.

1056
01:06:32,722 --> 01:06:34,917
That jerk. How could anyone
take him seriously?

1057
01:06:35,024 --> 01:06:38,960
- He's just a jerk.
- I think he feels incredibly threatened by you.

1058
01:06:39,061 --> 01:06:41,655
- What a clown.
- Is it true you're a baron?

1059
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:44,130
As a matter of fact, it is.

1060
01:06:44,233 --> 01:06:46,895
I don't take that sort of thing
seriously though.

1061
01:06:47,003 --> 01:06:49,471
<i>That was Audrey.
She is coming after all.</i>

1062
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:51,472
- Oh, Audrey Rouget?
- Uh-huh.

1063
01:06:51,574 --> 01:06:55,101
- She's getting pretty attractive.
- What are we watching?

1064
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,805
Oh, the International.

1065
01:06:57,913 --> 01:07:01,940
In a little bit more than an hour,
the, uh, season will be over.

1066
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:05,418
You really take that sort
of thing seriously? I can't.

1067
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:08,354
<i>There are a lot of things
you don't take very seriously.</i>

1068
01:07:08,457 --> 01:07:10,948
One could get the impression
you're not a very serious person.

1069
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:15,929
Who is this guy, some Nick Smith impersonator?
I was already sick of the original.

1070
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:18,592
Yeah, Tom, cut it out.
That's really gotten tiresome.

1071
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:21,670
The things that Nick said
were completely untrue.

1072
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:26,399
I'm sorry about last night.
I didn't mean what I said.

1073
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:32,106
No. I mean, it was idiotic of me
to... approach you that way.

1074
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:35,672
- I hadn't intended to.
- No, it wasn't idiotic.

1075
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,087
Miss Sabina Johnston
ofTyler, Texas...

1076
01:07:45,194 --> 01:07:48,322
and Cadet Lieutenant George Frawley
of our armed services.

1077
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:50,331
- Hello.
- Hi.

1078
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,269
- I still have a feeling.
- It's his age.

1079
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:59,466
I go away for a couple of hours,
and you have Von Sloneker up here?

1080
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,601
- I can invite anyone I want.
- So you invited him.

1081
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:06,477
I didn't, but even if I did,
it's none of your business.

1082
01:08:06,582 --> 01:08:09,483
How can you say that?
I mean, you know what kind of guy he is.

1083
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:13,487
I don't. It's just what you say,
and you're completely untrustworthy.

1084
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:16,558
- Not about something serious.
- Hey, Smith!

1085
01:08:16,659 --> 01:08:20,356
You're a liar. I've heard the crap
you've been telling about me.

1086
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:24,593
- Ah, you have?
- Yeah, about some girl I supposedly mistreated.

1087
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:28,796
A Polly Perkins? There isn't any Polly Perkins.
You know that.

1088
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:32,635
<i>Such a girl never even existed.</i>

1089
01:08:32,741 --> 01:08:35,266
Go on. Tell 'em. You made it up.

1090
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:39,039
<i>Is this true?</i>

1091
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:41,048
Yes and no.

1092
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,277
<i>- Oh, God, Nick!
- You did make it up.</i>

1093
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:47,446
<i>There is no one Polly Perkins.
There are many of them.</i>

1094
01:08:47,556 --> 01:08:49,854
So you admit you lied!

1095
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,122
<i>Polly Perkins is a composite,
like New York magazine does.</i>

1096
01:08:55,231 --> 01:08:57,324
Name one girl.

1097
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:59,901
Girls that have been degraded by you
don't need the further humiliation...

1098
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:03,961
of having their names bandied about
nonexclusive Park Avenue after-parties.

1099
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:08,407
- You see? There isn't one.
- This looks really bad, Nick.

1100
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,208
Cathy Livingstone. No more harm
can be done to her now.

1101
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:18,377
I had nothing to do with that,
and, anyway, she was completely unstable.

1102
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:22,856
Oh, that didn't stop you from boozing her up and then
talking her into pulling a train for you and Lemley.

1103
01:09:22,958 --> 01:09:26,189
- That is not how it happened.
- Aw, what did happen, Ricky?

1104
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:29,389
Anything that happened
between Cathy Livingstone and myself...

1105
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:32,626
<i>is entirely private
and entirely personal...</i>

1106
01:09:32,735 --> 01:09:35,932
<i>and had nothing to do with her suicide,
which was months afterwards.</i>

1107
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:39,235
<i>She kept trying to call and talk to you,
but you wouldn't even see her.!</i>

1108
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:43,778
I liked Cathy, but sometimes these things don't
work out, and a clean break is usually the best.

1109
01:09:43,879 --> 01:09:48,043
Oh, spare us this fake sensitivity.
Are her panties still in your collection?

1110
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,414
Rick keeps a collection of panties
of the girls that he's seduced.

1111
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:54,546
Oh, when they later kill themselves, do you
do anything special to memorialize them?

1112
01:09:54,657 --> 01:09:58,616
I don't let anyone
say that kind of thing to my face.

1113
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:01,195
Before you complained
that I said it behind your back.

1114
01:10:01,297 --> 01:10:04,357
Now it's that it's to your face.
Frankly, how can you tell which is which?

1115
01:10:09,438 --> 01:10:12,339
He had that coming for a long time.

1116
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:19,013
How dare he hit me!

1117
01:10:19,114 --> 01:10:21,605
He's the scoundrel.
I should have thrashed him.

1118
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,617
Well, you missed your chance.

1119
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:28,850
I would have if I hadn't been doing my damnedest
not to splatter blood all over the apartment.

1120
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:31,392
I got back, he was gone.
Nobody did anything to help me.

1121
01:10:31,493 --> 01:10:33,961
I'm facing one of the worst guys
of modern times...

1122
01:10:34,063 --> 01:10:36,429
and all I get's this whining criticism -

1123
01:10:36,532 --> 01:10:38,762
"Oh, this looks really bad, Nick. "

1124
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:41,165
Why should we believe you over Rick?

1125
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,297
We know you're a hypocrite. We know
your Polly Perkins story was a fabrication.

1126
01:10:45,407 --> 01:10:47,967
A composite!

1127
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:51,069
That you're totally impossible and out of control
with some sort of drug problem...

1128
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,013
and a fixation on what you consider
Rick Von Sloneker's wickedness.

1129
01:10:54,116 --> 01:10:58,018
<i>You're a snob, a sexist,
totally obnoxious and tiresome...</i>

1130
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:00,088
and, lately, you've gotten just weird.

1131
01:11:00,189 --> 01:11:04,785
- Why should we believe anything you say?
- I am not tiresome.

1132
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,861
What's Rick to you anyway?

1133
01:11:06,962 --> 01:11:08,987
Your shy friend hits me in the face...

1134
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:13,057
I'm about to go upstate to the domain of
a stepmother of untrammeled malevolence...

1135
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,136
very possibly to be killed...

1136
01:11:15,237 --> 01:11:17,467
and I get this.

1137
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:20,371
Well, who could blame her?

1138
01:11:20,476 --> 01:11:24,913
If not spattering blood was your objective,
you weren't terribly successful.

1139
01:11:28,851 --> 01:11:31,149
Well...

1140
01:11:31,253 --> 01:11:33,346
I'm going to Grand Central.

1141
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,389
The people are friendlier.

1142
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:37,891
I'll help you with your stuff.

1143
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:41,555
Why don't we all go see Nick off?

1144
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:55,298
Even within this group,
there are certain standards.

1145
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:58,380
Apparently,
I failed to live up to them.

1146
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:06,277
- Thanks for coming. Will you write?
- Yes.

1147
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:08,982
- Good-bye. Thanks for coming.
- Good-bye, sir.

1148
01:12:10,025 --> 01:12:11,959
- Good-bye, Tom.
- Good luck.

1149
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:16,930
I leave, counting on you and Charlie to maintain
the standards and ideals of the U.H.B.

1150
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:19,000
I've obviously failed to.

1151
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:21,729
You and Charlie are the only ones
who understand this kind of thing.

1152
01:12:21,837 --> 01:12:23,805
- What?
- Here.

1153
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:26,067
Thank you.

1154
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,643
- Oh. Also, you remember, in case I die -
- Yes.

1155
01:12:28,744 --> 01:12:31,178
- All right. Good-bye.
- Bye.

1156
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,180
<i>- Bye.
- Good-bye.</i>

1157
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:03,945
Is the 21 Club very expensive?

1158
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,946
<i>I believe so.</i>

1159
01:13:08,117 --> 01:13:09,744
That's priceless.

1160
01:13:09,852 --> 01:13:13,151
And then she told Miss Radford,
"They look awfully big for mice. "

1161
01:13:13,255 --> 01:13:15,155
- She believed it?
- Oh, completely.

1162
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:17,157
Oh, that's priceless.

1163
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:20,126
You mentioned something about it
in one of your letters.

1164
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:23,687
When I was going through some stuff over
Christmas, I found a packet of your old letters.

1165
01:13:23,799 --> 01:13:26,563
- You saved my letters?
- Of course.

1166
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:30,195
I save all the personal letters I get.
Don't you?

1167
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:33,001
No.

1168
01:13:33,108 --> 01:13:35,633
You mean, you threw away
all the letters I wrote you?

1169
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,712
I throw away nearly everything.

1170
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:41,476
I don't want to go through the rest of my life
with the mail I got when I was 16.

1171
01:13:41,583 --> 01:13:43,483
I'm surprised.

1172
01:13:43,585 --> 01:13:47,214
Someone goes through the trouble
of writing you a real letter, I save it.

1173
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:49,449
People don't write
many personal letters anymore.

1174
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:52,118
People in boarding school do.

1175
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,024
And what if someone who wrote you
becomes famous?

1176
01:13:56,131 --> 01:14:00,261
Those letters could be the only record of what they were
thinking at that time. Crucial for their biographers.

1177
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:03,861
Anybody who writes me who expects
to become famous should keep carbons.

1178
01:14:05,841 --> 01:14:08,469
It just seems to me
that it's a kind of trust.

1179
01:14:08,577 --> 01:14:13,480
If someone takes the trouble to write you
a substantial letter, you do not throw it out.

1180
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:18,217
I didn't save your letters,
but I didn't throw them out.

1181
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,653
I don't understand.
Is that a riddle?

1182
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:25,284
<i>There was a girl at school
who had some kind of a crush on you.</i>

1183
01:14:25,394 --> 01:14:29,455
She came into my room when I was throwing
things out, so I gave her your letters.

1184
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:31,465
Really?

1185
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:34,695
I know it sounds queer.

1186
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:38,000
- She kept them?
- Mmm. I'm sure.

1187
01:14:38,106 --> 01:14:40,836
How strange.
She must be really odd.

1188
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:43,741
No, she's very nice.

1189
01:14:43,846 --> 01:14:46,610
In fact, you know her.

1190
01:14:46,715 --> 01:14:48,615
Audrey Rouget.

1191
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:58,854
You mean, you think
you've gotten over Serena again.

1192
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:00,929
Yes, but it's different this time.

1193
01:15:01,029 --> 01:15:05,125
Then I was still intensely involved with her,
though in a negative way. Full of bitterness.

1194
01:15:05,234 --> 01:15:07,361
I don't feel that way now.

1195
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:10,165
<i>Charlie's on his way up.</i>

1196
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:12,467
Damn. There's something
I wanted to ask you.

1197
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:15,099
Oh, yeah. What was that surprising thing
Serena told you?

1198
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:19,078
Well, you probably already knew about it, but I was surprised
- about Audrey saving my letters.

1199
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:22,639
<i>- What letters?
- The ones I wrote Serena.</i>

1200
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,946
Audrey saved them?

1201
01:15:26,054 --> 01:15:27,954
God, how queer.

1202
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,990
Well, it's not so queer really.

1203
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,957
Serena was about to throw them out...

1204
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:34,858
and Audrey apparently didn't think
people's letters should be destroyed that way.

1205
01:15:34,963 --> 01:15:39,662
The really odd thing was though, while I was with
Serena, who's really nice and who's so good-looking -

1206
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,759
Yeah, Serena's basically a good person.

1207
01:15:41,870 --> 01:15:44,168
On the big night
I'd looked forward to for a week...

1208
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:47,174
I started feeling this incredible loneliness
being with Serena...

1209
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:50,404
and nostalgia for all those conversations
with Audrey before the big blowup.

1210
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,742
That was before I knew anything
about the letters.

1211
01:15:52,848 --> 01:15:56,978
<i>I think I preferred arguing with Audrey
than to agreeing with Serena or someone else.</i>

1212
01:15:57,085 --> 01:16:01,749
I'd only had that calmly unemotional perspective
on my relationship with Serena for a little while...

1213
01:16:01,857 --> 01:16:06,260
<i>when I started getting this warm glow at
the prospect of seeing Audrey here again tonight.</i>

1214
01:16:06,361 --> 01:16:08,124
Uh-oh.

1215
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:12,860
It surprised me because I thought that if-
if it didn't work out with Serena this time...

1216
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,869
I'd put that sort of thing
on hold for a long time.

1217
01:16:15,971 --> 01:16:18,997
People shouldn't get married till their late 20s,
and that's a long way off.

1218
01:16:19,107 --> 01:16:22,076
- Well, your timing is really awful.
- What do you mean?

1219
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:29,380
Damn. I'll get it.
I want to continue this.

1220
01:16:35,090 --> 01:16:37,388
- Where's Jane?
- She's still in her room.

1221
01:16:37,492 --> 01:16:39,960
- What would you like to drink?
- So you're our host?

1222
01:16:40,062 --> 01:16:42,496
I don't know. What do people
who don't drink have?

1223
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:47,399
Ginger ale? Ice water?
Ah, maybe a Coke with an aspirin.

1224
01:16:48,570 --> 01:16:51,198
You don't need to put on
pink eye shadow for us.

1225
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:53,934
It's not for you.
I've got a date.

1226
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:57,671
A date? What's that?
It sounds like something from the 1950s.

1227
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,679
Yeah. Who's the fella?

1228
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:02,978
None of you know him,
and I'd like to keep it that way.

1229
01:17:07,356 --> 01:17:10,450
What did you mean when you said that
about my timing being off?

1230
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,255
Audrey's gone to Cynthia's
in Connecticut for the weekend...

1231
01:17:13,362 --> 01:17:15,557
and then on Wednesday
she flies back to France.

1232
01:17:15,664 --> 01:17:17,655
And besides that,
she thinks you're a total jerk.

1233
01:17:17,766 --> 01:17:18,960
<i>- She hates you.
- She hates me?</i>

1234
01:17:19,067 --> 01:17:22,161
Well, she despises you.
Actually, it's a bit my fault.

1235
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:24,830
<i>I asked for that Truth question
with a specific idea in mind...</i>

1236
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:27,340
<i>of showing her
you hadn't gotten over Serena yet.</i>

1237
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:31,670
- A Mr. Andrews is downstairs for you.
- Say I'll be right down.

1238
01:17:31,780 --> 01:17:34,010
- We'll go down with you.
- No, you won't.

1239
01:17:34,116 --> 01:17:36,516
- We can all go out together.
- No. This is a date.

1240
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,086
Well, it seems rude
not to go down and check him out.

1241
01:17:39,187 --> 01:17:44,056
Please don't. Feel free to stay here.
There's plenty of food and stuff.

1242
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,219
But it's all right if we stay here
and wait for everyone else?

1243
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,559
Sure, but what "everyone else"?

1244
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:53,333
Well, the rest of the S.F.R.P.

1245
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,063
You are the S.F.R.P. tonight.

1246
01:17:56,171 --> 01:18:00,232
Oh, could you be out by midnight?
Feel free to stay until then though. Bye!

1247
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:02,242
- Bye.
- Bye.

1248
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:06,405
Bye. Be out by midnight?
What's going on?

1249
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:10,713
Jane brings this guy she hardly knows
back for some kind of assignation?

1250
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:13,253
- We don't know that.
- Well -

1251
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,516
I'm really surprised atJane.

1252
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:18,388
Some guy asks her out,
and she abandons everything.

1253
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:21,792
The rest of us can, well,
just go to heck.

1254
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:24,923
The whole Rat Pack thing
seems to have disintegrated.

1255
01:18:25,033 --> 01:18:27,968
The Rat Pack is down to the rats.

1256
01:18:28,070 --> 01:18:31,597
This is really depressing.
Let's get out of here.

1257
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,739
I guess it's understandable that she
would prefer to go out on a date...

1258
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:45,149
which offers some romantic promise,
even if very slight, than stay with us.

1259
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:49,314
Still, it's a bit disappointing.
I thought we were better friends than that.

1260
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:51,949
I wonder whether
we're really friends for them at all.

1261
01:18:52,060 --> 01:18:54,187
We're just way stations
between dates.

1262
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:59,097
I mean, for them, men are either dates,
potential dates or date substitutes.

1263
01:18:59,201 --> 01:19:01,226
I find that dehumanizing.

1264
01:19:01,336 --> 01:19:04,567
That might be the case
with Cynthia or Sally...

1265
01:19:04,673 --> 01:19:06,868
but Audrey, for instance,
is completely different.

1266
01:19:06,975 --> 01:19:09,876
She's someone who would keep up
her friendships no matter what.

1267
01:19:09,978 --> 01:19:14,438
And Audrey has a rare largeness of mind.
She's not obsessed with her love life.

1268
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:18,076
She's good-looking, smart...

1269
01:19:18,186 --> 01:19:20,620
charming, principled.

1270
01:19:20,722 --> 01:19:22,690
It's an unusual combination.

1271
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:29,996
<i>What do you mean?</i>

1272
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:33,295
<i>You've given her nothing but grief all the past week.
- I think I'll be going now.</i>

1273
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:36,928
I have nothing to say,
and I'm completely boring without a drink.

1274
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:39,506
It's only midnight.
You can't go.

1275
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:44,102
I'm sorry, but without cocktails,
staying up all night loses its charm.

1276
01:19:44,212 --> 01:19:47,181
Besides, I haven't had anything amusing
to say since I stopped drinking.

1277
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,274
Did you have anything amusing to say
before you stopped?

1278
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:53,081
I know, but it seemed amusing.
Now it doesn't.

1279
01:19:53,188 --> 01:19:56,282
- Well, you were asleep.
- Was that it?

1280
01:19:56,391 --> 01:20:00,293
- Good night, Charlie. Ciao, Tommy.
- Ciao, Fred.

1281
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:06,526
<i>?I won't be loved, baby?</i>

1282
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:10,435
When I was in college, we'd go to dances
during Christmas vacations.

1283
01:20:10,539 --> 01:20:13,337
- Do they still go on?
- Yes.

1284
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,205
- Pretty much reduced though.
- Yeah.

1285
01:20:16,311 --> 01:20:18,575
<i>Ah, well, I wouldn't put
much stock in them.</i>

1286
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,308
You go to a party, you meet a group
of people, you like them, you think...

1287
01:20:21,416 --> 01:20:24,783
"These people are going to be my friends
for the rest of my life. "

1288
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:28,822
Then you never see them again.
I wonder where they go.

1289
01:20:28,924 --> 01:20:31,392
Do you think it's true, though,
that, generally speaking...

1290
01:20:31,493 --> 01:20:33,927
people from this sort of background
are doomed to failure?

1291
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:36,657
Doomed?
That would, uh, be far easier.

1292
01:20:36,765 --> 01:20:40,326
No, we simply fail
without being doomed.

1293
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:43,836
- But you feel that you have failed.
- Yeah.

1294
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,998
You can still afford
to come to places like this though.

1295
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:49,235
<i>I'm not destitute.
I've got a goodjob that pays decently.</i>

1296
01:20:49,344 --> 01:20:53,940
It's just that it's all so mediocre,
so unimpressive.

1297
01:20:54,049 --> 01:20:58,179
The acid test is whether you take any pleasure
in responding to the question...

1298
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,754
"What do you do?"

1299
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,552
I can't bear it.

1300
01:21:03,658 --> 01:21:08,561
You start out expecting something much more,
and some of your contemporaries achieve it.

1301
01:21:08,663 --> 01:21:12,030
You start reading about them in the papers
or seeing them on TV.

1302
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:14,431
That's the danger
of midtown Manhattan -

1303
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:17,767
running across
far more successful contemporaries.

1304
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,967
I try to avoid them whenever I can.

1305
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:24,773
But when I can't,
they're always very friendly...

1306
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:28,577
but inevitably they ask,
what am I doing, or think it.

1307
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:32,710
I - I find it hard to believe that many people
from our background are successful.

1308
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:36,052
Aren't you confusing them with people
that you might have known from college...

1309
01:21:36,157 --> 01:21:38,387
who came from normal backgrounds?

1310
01:21:38,493 --> 01:21:43,294
It's not surprising that -
that an energetic, self-confident achiever...

1311
01:21:43,398 --> 01:21:45,366
free of UHB illusions...

1312
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:47,435
should be successful.

1313
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:49,469
- UHB? What's UHB?
- UHB.

1314
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:53,837
U.H.B. It's an acronym
for Urban Haute Bourgeoisie.

1315
01:21:53,942 --> 01:21:57,036
It's a more sociologically precise
alternative...

1316
01:21:57,145 --> 01:21:59,978
to "preppy" and other terms.

1317
01:22:00,081 --> 01:22:02,641
Well, you're partly right.

1318
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:06,346
Some of the people whom I mentioned
were not from... UHB?

1319
01:22:06,454 --> 01:22:08,922
- That's right.
- UHB backgrounds, but some of them were.

1320
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:12,152
You're going to have to accept
that people from our background...

1321
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,990
are not doomed to failure.

1322
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:20,060
I - I wonder if they were typical UHBs.

1323
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:24,366
There was -There was probably
some factor which set them apart.

1324
01:22:24,472 --> 01:22:26,599
And, also, their-
their career is not over.

1325
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:29,006
I mean, the failure
could still be to come.

1326
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:41,144
- He seems less pessimistic than you.
- I know. It doesn't ring true.

1327
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:48,561
Look, there's a light on.

1328
01:22:48,663 --> 01:22:51,029
We can't go up to her place
unannounced after midnight.

1329
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:54,761
- It all depends who's on the elevator.
- It's not a question of who's on the elevator.

1330
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:56,928
I mean, you've known Sally
for, what, 10 days?

1331
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:59,506
And you're barging in on her uninvited
in the middle of the night?

1332
01:22:59,607 --> 01:23:03,509
She said we should come up anytime we saw the
living room lights on, which they clearly are.

1333
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:06,136
- At least call first.
- What, and wake up her parents?

1334
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:08,715
Well, you act as if her apartment
were our living room.

1335
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:10,785
<i>It is our living room.</i>

1336
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:13,720
<i>Thanks, Ed.</i>

1337
01:23:16,791 --> 01:23:20,090
- What are we doing here?
- It'll be all right.

1338
01:23:22,964 --> 01:23:26,923
- What are you doing here?
- You told us to come up if we saw the lights on.

1339
01:23:27,035 --> 01:23:30,402
- I'm sorry to bother you.
- I was just about to go out.

1340
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,269
<i>- Oh.
- Who is it?</i>

1341
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,173
Just some friends.

1342
01:23:36,277 --> 01:23:38,177
Well, come on in.

1343
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:45,942
<i>Allen, these are my friends,
Charlie and Tommy.</i>

1344
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:48,955
Allen is the record producer
who discovered The Hated Few.

1345
01:23:49,057 --> 01:23:51,617
- They're very good.
- Yes, they are.

1346
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:55,127
And Sally will be very good.
She's got a wonderful voice.

1347
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:58,666
<i>I think we also have a friend in common-
Rick Von Sloneker.</i>

1348
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:01,292
Yeah. You're a friend of Rick's?

1349
01:24:01,403 --> 01:24:04,930
Oh, sure. Rick's a great guy. Our houses
are next to each other in Southampton.

1350
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,508
Wow, it's late.
Uh, we'd better get going.

1351
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:10,237
I don't think there's time for drinks
after all.

1352
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:19,518
Do you have any idea when everyone's getting back?
It's as if the whole S.F.R.P. had disintegrated.

1353
01:24:19,621 --> 01:24:23,580
We can't just keep getting together with the same
people every night for the rest of our lives.

1354
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:25,591
I don't see why not.

1355
01:24:25,693 --> 01:24:28,161
It's inevitable that things
get more back to normal sometime.

1356
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:30,458
- This wasn't normal?
- No.

1357
01:24:30,565 --> 01:24:32,692
I wish somebody
had told me that before.

1358
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,269
Could you tell me, at least,
when Cynthia and Audrey are getting back?

1359
01:24:35,370 --> 01:24:37,600
I don't know. That's their affair.

1360
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:40,105
<i>- Your friend Cynthia's gone to that house party at Rick's.
- In Southampton?</i>

1361
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,335
<i>- Uh-huh.
- I'm not sure if she was really going.</i>

1362
01:24:42,444 --> 01:24:44,412
<i>You guys are so tiresome.</i>

1363
01:24:59,727 --> 01:25:02,457
That was really embarrassing.
Thank you for including me.

1364
01:25:02,564 --> 01:25:04,498
I can't believe it. God!

1365
01:25:04,599 --> 01:25:08,729
Maybe, underneath it all, he's a nice guy, but he
sure doesn't make a very good first impression.

1366
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:11,499
- No, not about that. What he said about Cynthia.
- Oh.

1367
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:14,131
Look, if Audrey's supposed to be
visiting Cynthia in Connecticut...

1368
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:17,006
and Cynthia's in Southampton
with Von Sloneker, what does that mean?

1369
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,410
That Audrey and Cynthia
are in different states.

1370
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,414
No. There's only one explanation.

1371
01:25:21,516 --> 01:25:25,475
Audrey has gone with Cynthia
to Von Sloneker's house party in Southampton.

1372
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:28,920
You know, you're always
selling Audrey awfully short, aren't you?

1373
01:25:29,023 --> 01:25:31,787
I mean, I find that - that
really despicable.

1374
01:25:31,893 --> 01:25:34,919
Could you stop calling me despicable?
I'm really worried about Audrey.

1375
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:37,691
Jane says that since that Truth session,
she's been in a very strange mood...

1376
01:25:37,799 --> 01:25:39,767
and said some really odd things.

1377
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:42,302
She told Jane she didn't feel
like a real woman.

1378
01:25:42,403 --> 01:25:44,803
- She said that?
- That's the way Cynthia talks.

1379
01:25:44,906 --> 01:25:46,806
Yeah.

1380
01:25:46,908 --> 01:25:49,672
I can't - I can't really share
your concern.

1381
01:25:49,777 --> 01:25:53,076
I mean, Audrey wouldn't put herself
in the situation you describe.

1382
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:55,809
She's got very, very clear views
on these things.

1383
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,647
I mean, you know that -
that she's a big admirer ofJane Austen.

1384
01:25:58,753 --> 01:26:02,120
- But she's turned her back on all that.
- Oh, I don't believe that.

1385
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:04,191
She's probably at home,
asleep right now...

1386
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:07,887
with her pink coverlet tucked up tight
and her stuffed animals looking down over her.

1387
01:26:07,996 --> 01:26:10,863
- Well, let's call her then.
- We can't.

1388
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:15,334
- It's only a local call.
- We can't call her up now. It's nearly 3:00 a. m.

1389
01:26:15,436 --> 01:26:17,563
We'd -We'd wake up her parents.

1390
01:26:17,672 --> 01:26:20,641
This is important to them too.
What if she's already at Von Sloneker's?

1391
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,710
I'm sure he's not asleep.

1392
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:28,072
Older people tend to get up really early.
I'll call the Rougets at 7:00.

1393
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:32,620
If there's any risk of Audrey going out
to Von Sloneker's, I'll give you a call.

1394
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:35,450
But - But I don't expect to have to.

1395
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:37,457
Could you call me either way?

1396
01:26:37,559 --> 01:26:40,551
At 7:00? Okay.

1397
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:42,926
Thanks.
You're not such a bad fellow.

1398
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:45,693
- I'll call you.
- Call me.

1399
01:26:57,912 --> 01:27:00,176
I hate him.

1400
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:04,917
<i>- Audrey Rouget?
- Uh-huh.</i>

1401
01:27:05,019 --> 01:27:08,978
- She's getting very attractive.
- She was the first girl that ever made him feel that way.

1402
01:27:09,090 --> 01:27:11,456
She thinks you're a total jerk.
She hates you.

1403
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,289
When you're an egoist,
none of the harm you do is intentional.

1404
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:19,332
- Well, she despises you.
- Him. Victor Lemley, the other crew member.

1405
01:27:19,434 --> 01:27:23,393
- I want to be a real woman.
- You're the only girl who's ever made me feel this way.

1406
01:27:23,504 --> 01:27:26,268
I had nothing to do with that,
and, anyway, she was completely unstable.

1407
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:28,342
I want to be a real woman.

1408
01:27:37,518 --> 01:27:40,214
I called Audrey's parents
exactly at 7:00.

1409
01:27:40,321 --> 01:27:42,755
It turns out that they're
not - not such early risers.

1410
01:27:42,857 --> 01:27:46,884
But they- they thought that Audrey
was with Cynthia in Connecticut too.

1411
01:27:46,995 --> 01:27:49,862
So I called Cynthia's,
and her mother answered.

1412
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:51,932
Apparently,
she was sleeping late also.

1413
01:27:52,033 --> 01:27:55,969
But she said that Cynthia
was visiting Audrey.

1414
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:59,801
- Jesus!
- Well, Cynthia borrowed her mother's car.

1415
01:27:59,907 --> 01:28:02,341
And the last anyone has seen
of either of them...

1416
01:28:02,443 --> 01:28:04,411
was about 4:00 yesterday afternoon.

1417
01:28:04,512 --> 01:28:07,481
So they might have gotten
to Von Sloneker's already last night.

1418
01:28:07,582 --> 01:28:09,550
You were right.

1419
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,420
But I am authorized
to use my mother's card.

1420
01:28:16,524 --> 01:28:18,958
I use it all the time.

1421
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,563
- She wasn't very polite.
- No, she wasn't.

1422
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,568
That should be plenty.

1423
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:34,834
Yeah.

1424
01:28:40,882 --> 01:28:44,682
- I can't believe you don't have a license.
- Of course I don't. I live in Manhattan.

1425
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,778
- I'm just really surprised, that's all.
- Oh, give me a break.

1426
01:28:47,889 --> 01:28:50,858
I don't go out to the Hamptons.
You could have gotten one easily.

1427
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:54,086
- I'm no jock.
- God, what a disaster.

1428
01:28:54,195 --> 01:28:56,959
No, I'm -
I'm gonna get a license soon.

1429
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,631
This must be how
the - the, um, failure starts -

1430
01:29:00,735 --> 01:29:04,535
an incompetence in mastering
the common tasks of everyday life.

1431
01:29:04,639 --> 01:29:07,733
- Doesn't Fred have a license?
- Yeah.

1432
01:29:07,842 --> 01:29:09,742
Okay.

1433
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,712
Bye.

1434
01:29:13,781 --> 01:29:17,080
He says he can't.
He's about to get fired as it is.

1435
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:19,210
He was always saying
what a lousy job it was.

1436
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:22,346
- Did you tell him how serious the situation is?
- Yes.

1437
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:27,192
He's always complaining
about what a lousy job it is.

1438
01:29:27,295 --> 01:29:30,731
You know, it's possible that, to other people,
the situation might not seem so ominous...

1439
01:29:30,832 --> 01:29:32,800
<i>as it does to you and me.</i>

1440
01:29:32,900 --> 01:29:36,028
<i>I- I mean, what can really happen?</i>

1441
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:39,106
Of course, you have been right up till now,
and Von Sloneker is a bad guy...

1442
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,107
I mean, capable of anything.

1443
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:44,474
It might sound melodramatic
to say that he's ruined girls.

1444
01:29:44,579 --> 01:29:47,548
<i>I mean, what does that
really mean today?</i>

1445
01:29:47,648 --> 01:29:51,140
But it's true. I mean,
he's done some unspeakable things.

1446
01:29:51,252 --> 01:29:54,813
<i>And if Audrey's as upset and bitter as it seems,
well, then anything could happen.</i>

1447
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:57,958
We gotta get out there
as fast as possible.

1448
01:29:58,059 --> 01:30:01,460
While we sit here, flailing around, anything
could be happening out at Von Sloneker's.

1449
01:30:01,562 --> 01:30:03,928
If only Nick were here.
He'd know what to do.

1450
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:06,499
Yeah, he's got all sorts
of licenses and credit cards.

1451
01:30:06,601 --> 01:30:09,570
<i>What would Nick do?
How would he get out of this?</i>

1452
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:14,002
You've got a lot of cash on you now.

1453
01:30:14,108 --> 01:30:16,269
Yes. Lots.

1454
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:53,945
Whenever I think we might be overreacting,
I remember Polly Perkins.

1455
01:30:54,048 --> 01:30:57,848
- Or Cathy Livingstone.
- I think I knew her.

1456
01:30:59,821 --> 01:31:02,119
What are you gonna do
when we get there?

1457
01:31:02,223 --> 01:31:05,249
I don't know.
It depends on what the situation is.

1458
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:12,355
Yesterday I was thinking,
maybe Fourier was a crank...

1459
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,901
his ideas completely unworkable.

1460
01:31:15,002 --> 01:31:18,836
I wouldn't want to live on a farm
with a lot of other people.

1461
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:26,413
You know, Rick's a strange guy.
He's pretty violent.

1462
01:31:28,115 --> 01:31:30,640
He might not be
too pleased to see us.

1463
01:31:30,751 --> 01:31:32,719
I've thought of that.

1464
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:13,486
Thanks a lot.
We shouldn't be long.

1465
01:32:13,594 --> 01:32:16,791
Well, take as long as you want.
I'm leaving.

1466
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:21,426
Oh, no. Um, we need you to take us back.
That -That was understood.

1467
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,027
Think I'm gonna wait around
for you guys? You're crazy.

1468
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:34,672
But I - I don't know how
we're going to get back.

1469
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:36,977
What's this shit?

1470
01:32:37,084 --> 01:32:39,746
- Oh, a gratuity is included.
- What's this shit?

1471
01:32:47,628 --> 01:32:50,756
I was sure th-that we agreed
on 120 as the full price.

1472
01:32:58,072 --> 01:33:01,098
- Hey, look at this.
- What is it?

1473
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:03,904
- Looks like some girl's panties.
- Jesus. That bastard.

1474
01:33:41,215 --> 01:33:44,446
<i>What are you clowns doing here?</i>

1475
01:33:44,552 --> 01:33:46,884
<i>- What are you doing?
- This is my place.</i>

1476
01:33:46,988 --> 01:33:49,718
- I can do whatever I want here.
- That's not true.

1477
01:33:49,824 --> 01:33:52,816
<i>How dare you break in here?
Did they break that?</i>

1478
01:33:52,927 --> 01:33:55,157
What are you doing here?
This is so embarrassing.

1479
01:33:55,262 --> 01:33:58,129
A little embarrassment
could do you some good.

1480
01:33:58,232 --> 01:34:00,530
And by the way, whose are these?

1481
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:03,502
I haven't the slightest idea.
Just get out of here, you twerps!

1482
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:08,132
<i>- They buy them new and scatter them around. It's one of Rick's little delicacies.
- That's a lie.</i>

1483
01:34:08,242 --> 01:34:11,075
Look, get out of here and take this flat-chested
goody-goody pain in the neck with you.

1484
01:34:11,178 --> 01:34:14,875
- Thank you.
- She is not a goody-goody.

1485
01:34:14,982 --> 01:34:17,542
<i>Oh, oh, before you go-</i>

1486
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,847
Hey! Hey!

1487
01:34:19,954 --> 01:34:22,582
- Jesus! He's got a gun!
- What are you, crazy?

1488
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:26,353
- I warn you, he's a Fourierist.
- It's only a joke, Rick.

1489
01:34:26,460 --> 01:34:29,657
<i>It's a toy or an antique or something.</i>

1490
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:34,064
Well, then let the jerk
play his little game.

1491
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:48,814
No, it's not that far.
It's, like, an hour.

1492
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:51,043
Or- Or maybe two, probably.

1493
01:34:51,152 --> 01:34:53,552
Did anything happen?

1494
01:34:53,654 --> 01:34:55,554
Of course not.

1495
01:34:55,656 --> 01:34:58,750
Then you were never really interested
in Von Sloneker at all.

1496
01:35:00,861 --> 01:35:03,056
Well, then why did you
come out here?

1497
01:35:03,164 --> 01:35:05,132
To get a suntan.

1498
01:35:06,233 --> 01:35:09,225
The whole thing with the Rat Pack
was getting claustrophobic.

1499
01:35:09,336 --> 01:35:12,897
And Cynthia insisted I come.
She's terribly impressed with Rick.

1500
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:16,443
It's not something Jane Austen
would have done.

1501
01:35:16,544 --> 01:35:19,342
No.

1502
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:22,143
I suppose Europe is over there.

1503
01:35:22,249 --> 01:35:25,013
No, that'd be more Brazil.
Europe would be more that way.

1504
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:29,181
Are you really going back next week?

1505
01:35:29,290 --> 01:35:31,918
I guess so.

1506
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:34,995
What can you study in France
that you can't study here?

1507
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:40,192
French.

1508
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:43,634
Actually, I was thinking of coming back
when the semester ends.

1509
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:47,936
I was thinking of going over, though not
necessarily to Grenoble, but to France or Italy.

1510
01:35:48,042 --> 01:35:49,942
Though my resources are limited.

1511
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:53,673
There are some awfully cheap
airfares these days.

1512
01:35:53,781 --> 01:35:56,511
It would seem a shame
not to take advantage of them.

1513
01:35:56,617 --> 01:35:58,744
That's the way I feel.

1514
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:04,550
Do you really think
I'm flat-chested?

1515
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:07,354
Well, I never thought about it.
Well, I shouldn't say that.

1516
01:36:07,461 --> 01:36:11,192
The thing is, you look really great,
and that's what's important.

1517
01:36:11,298 --> 01:36:13,391
You don't wanna overdo it.
