1
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:32,699
-What about the kid who rings the bell?
-What kid? What bell?

2
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:37,704
The kid. After the mine caves in,
he rings the bell to alert the town.

3
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:42,292
-Is that in the script?
-What if we gave the kid a disease?

4
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,254
-A disease?
-Braces on the leg, that sort of thing.

5
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,590
-But he runs.
-He could hobble.

6
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:53,636
A How Green Was My Valley thing.
Is that McDowall kid available?

7
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,473
-Too old. Plus, he’s English.
-So?

8
00:00:56,639 --> 00:01:00,018
-The script’s set in Tennessee.
-Did I get that page?

9
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:03,605
Forget the disease. Nobody wants it.
It’s depressing.

10
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:07,192
-Boss is right. Who needs disease?
-It’s horrible.

11
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,694
-I hate disease.
-Box-office poison.

12
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,739
Hold on. I think I got a "what if."

13
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,451
What if we give the character--
What’s his name?

14
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,703
-Floyd.
-Terrible name. Change it.

15
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,165
-Say we give no-name a dog.
-A dog?

16
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:24,959
A dog. No-name’s faithful companion.

17
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,755
Toils at his master’s side
in the coal mine.

18
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:32,175
Cave-in happens,
only the dog gets out.

19
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,594
‘Cause dogs are smaller, usually.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:39,432
And it’s the dog that runs
up the hill and rings the bell.

21
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,601
Holy crap, that’s beautiful.

22
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,104
-I’m choked up.
-I got goose bumps.

23
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,898
Lassie pictures always gross high.

24
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:50,110
Instead of a disease,
we give the kid a dog?

25
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:56,282
-There is no kid. The kid’s a dog.
-Could be just what the movie needs.

26
00:01:56,491 --> 00:02:00,036
Let’s ask the writer.
What do you think, Pete?

27
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:09,129
Wow. That’s just...

28
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,674
...amazing.

29
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,392
Of course, it’s not
like the postcards say it is.

30
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,186
It’s not glamour everywhere you look.

31
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:30,275
I should know. I live here.

32
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,694
This is my town.

33
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,129
It seems like everyone here’s
from someplace else.

34
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,590
The reason? Movies.

35
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,218
Everybody loves the movies...

36
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:41,346
... which makes Hollywood
everybody’s town.

37
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:44,182
They come here by the busload.

38
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:48,395
The next show will be starting
in five minutes.

39
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:53,441
Please step up
to purchase your tickets....

40
00:04:20,135 --> 00:04:22,262
Candy.

41
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,930
Treats.

42
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,268
-Bonbons.
-There you go.

43
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,729
For most, Grauman’s Chinese Theater...

44
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:33,940
...is the most exciting place
on the planet.

45
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,902
For me, it’s that and more.

46
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,197
It’s the theater playing
my first film credit.

47
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,616
No, not that one.

48
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,618
I wish.

49
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,916
No, I’m the B movie tonight.
Sand Pirates of the Sahara.

50
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,295
Not a bad picture, if I say so myself.

51
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,132
You gotta start somewhere.

52
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:06,306
God, I love seeing my name
on a poster.

53
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:11,978
Four years ago, in film land’s
darkest hour...

54
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,147
...the so-called Hollywood 10...

55
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:18,526
...testified before the House Committee
on Un-American Activities...

56
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,738
...investigating the Communist menace
in Hollywood.

57
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:25,241
Have you ever been a member
of the Communist Party?

58
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,703
Communism is not related to this.

59
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:30,705
Refusing to answer questions...

60
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:34,626
...the 10 writers dared
Congress to come after them.

61
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,755
After years of wrangling,
it’s time to pay the piper.

62
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,592
It’s off to jail.
The charge: contempt of Congress.

63
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:45,595
A new round of hearings
begins this fall.

64
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:49,224
The mandate: Get the Reds
out of Hollywood!

65
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,977
-Miss me?
-Every second.

66
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:59,109
That’s my girlfriend, Sandra Sinclair.
This is her town too.

67
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:03,196
She’s from Cleveland.
She came out here to be an actress.

68
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,323
And that’s what she’s doing.

69
00:06:05,532 --> 00:06:08,284
The first picture
she ever appeared in...

70
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:11,579
... was the first picture I ever wrote.

71
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,920
The lovely Emily. My desert dove.

72
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:27,679
Did you think you could
just fly away from me?

73
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,099
-Hands off, Khalid!
-Roland!

74
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,063
-You! I thought you were dead.
-You thought wrong.

75
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:54,247
-Let her go.
-I find your persistence tiresome.

76
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,833
I get that a lot.

77
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,129
Roland, look out!

78
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,431
This time I’ll make sure
you’re dead.

79
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,684
Taste my steel, you dog.

80
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:17,645
Taste my steel, you dog.

81
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:20,440
We were young, we were in love...

82
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:26,237
...and we were working
in the pictures. Life was good.

83
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,012
Louise, what gives?

84
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:53,932
They gave everyone the day off.

85
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:57,852
-What about my pages? Are they typed?
-Pages?

86
00:07:58,061 --> 00:08:00,980
I’m on a deadline, I need my pages.

87
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:05,318
-Those men took them.
-What men? Those pages aren’t ready.

88
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:09,614
Pete, I’m not even supposed
to be talking to you.

89
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,210
They say you attended those meetings
while in college.

90
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:23,712
Who’s they?

91
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:27,716
Congress, FBI, Red Channels.
It doesn’t matter.

92
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,512
They know who they are,
that’s enough. Answer the question.

93
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:36,599
Meetings, meetings.
How the hell should I know?

94
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:40,729
It was a long time ago.
I went to college on the G.I. Bill.

95
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,690
The Bread Instead of Bullets Club.

96
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:50,113
They were Communists?
What do I know?

97
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:53,575
I couldn’t figure out
what they were saying.

98
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:57,579
-Why did you go, Peter?
-There was this girl.

99
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,457
You consorted with Communists
for a girl?

100
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,961
I went to poetry readings too.
That doesn’t make me Carl Sandburg.

101
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,089
Leo, you know me. I’m non-political.

102
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:12,385
Republicans, Democrats, Communists.
They all look alike to me.

103
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:15,764
As legal counsel for this studio...

104
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,434
...I strongly advise you
to watch what you say.

105
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,438
Leo, put your agent hat on.

106
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,776
-There must be an angle you can work.
-I’m out of angles.

107
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:32,155
We’re in the middle of negotiating
my new contract.

108
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:36,284
The studio suspended
negotiations this morning.

109
00:09:36,785 --> 00:09:40,413
I’ve been blacklisted?
I’ve been goddamn blacklisted?

110
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:44,250
-There is no blacklist.
-Right. No blacklist.

111
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:49,255
Studio just doesn’t wanna know you
with this hanging over your head.

112
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,968
I can’t leave.
We’re shooting in three weeks.

113
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,763
Ashes to Ashes has been pulled.

114
00:09:56,971 --> 00:10:00,517
-You believe it?
-I’m sorry, Peter.

115
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:03,645
So, what does this mean?
I have to testify?

116
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,730
Assuming they let you.

117
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:08,900
The least they can do
is let me defend myself.

118
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:14,489
The studio will lobby on your behalf.
That’s all I can promise you.

119
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:17,534
No guarantees.

120
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:23,415
-You up for testifying?
-What choice do I have?

121
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:27,711
They feed on names.
You’ll have to give them some.

122
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:31,172
I’m a writer.
I’ll make up names if I have to.

123
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:34,718
We’re talking about my career,
my life.

124
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,471
Christ, I’ll give them anything
they want.

125
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,915
Come on, toast with me.

126
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:11,504
To the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

127
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:20,388
Hey, Pete.
Think maybe you’ve had enough?

128
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:25,810
Tell me something, Jerry.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

129
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,023
I wouldn’t know Hoover if he walked
in here wearing a dress.

130
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:34,027
Too bad. He says I’m a Communist.

131
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,240
In fact, at this very moment
some grey little FBI guy...

132
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,452
...in a grey little FBI suit...

133
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:49,084
...is hunched over my screenplay,
checking it, line by line...

134
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:55,757
...for the poisonous Marxist
propaganda which surely lurks therein.

135
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,551
Hope they check for spelling.

136
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:02,097
-I can always use help with that.
-You’re babbling.

137
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,725
Ashes to Ashes, my movie!

138
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:14,109
Could’ve been good.
Even with the stupid dog.

139
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,861
My Grapes of Wrath.

140
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,615
My shot at doing something
really good, something....

141
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,993
Something.

142
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:29,666
-What’s it about?
-Pain, nobility.

143
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,419
The human condition.

144
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:37,257
Truth.

145
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,600
It was my chance to get out
of B movies and onto the A list.

146
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:52,939
Go home. Why don’t I call
that gal of yours, Sandy?

147
00:12:53,148 --> 00:12:56,359
Can’t, she dumped me.

148
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,989
Don’t you worry about me.

149
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:05,785
Hey, I’m gonna give you
a little extra something...

150
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:11,124
...because you took a big chance
talking to me.

151
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:15,670
Pete, you’re not gonna drive
in this condition, are you?

152
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:22,344
I can’t take this constant nagging.
I’m leaving you, Jerry.

153
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:26,973
I’m leaving, and I’m taking
the monkey with me.

154
00:14:09,391 --> 00:14:12,227
Hey, I got a "what if."

155
00:14:12,394 --> 00:14:16,731
What if you and me
just drive up the coast...

156
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:21,319
...till the sun comes up
or the gas runs out?

157
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:27,075
We change our names,
start new lives...

158
00:14:28,451 --> 00:14:30,662
...never come back.

159
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:37,127
Sound good?
Oh, you’re just saying that.

160
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:43,591
I’m talking to the monkey.

161
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:11,471
Oh, my God! Okay. Okay, come on.

162
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,225
It’s okay. It’ll be fine.

163
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:20,021
It’s gonna be fine.
It’s gonna be fine.

164
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:23,274
It’s gonna be...

165
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:32,367
...fine. Oh, shit!

166
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:36,413
Come on. Come on!

167
00:16:41,835 --> 00:16:43,753
We got it. We got it.

168
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:55,015
Jesus, no! God! Oh, God!

169
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,897
Come on. What the hell?! Let me out!

170
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,194
Help!

171
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,451
Teddy, what you got there? Hey, Teddy.
I Knock it off! Get out of there!

172
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,246
What in God’s name--?

173
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:49,004
What in the hell happened to you, son?

174
00:18:49,212 --> 00:18:54,134
-I’m not exactly sure.
-You think you can sit up?

175
00:18:54,342 --> 00:18:56,720
I could try.

176
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:59,014
Easy. Easy.

177
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,727
Easy. All right. Oh, my God.

178
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:07,188
Wait a minute.
Maybe you shouldn’t stand.

179
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:10,150
Do you wanna try it? Great God.

180
00:19:10,358 --> 00:19:13,278
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

181
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:16,740
What in the hell--?

182
00:19:17,365 --> 00:19:21,828
The town is a fair piece down there.

183
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:26,875
Do you wanna try walking?

184
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:30,128
-Okay.
-You sure?

185
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:33,214
All right, take it easy.
Now, just go slow.

186
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:35,508
Go slow, damn it.

187
00:19:39,637 --> 00:19:42,557
Oh, easy. Easy. Here, here.

188
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:45,977
-Use that. I think it’s clean.
-Thank you.

189
00:19:47,062 --> 00:19:52,817
You know, you seem an odd bit
familiar to me.

190
00:19:53,026 --> 00:19:55,111
Do I know you?

191
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:02,243
I don’t know. Do you?

192
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:12,045
-It’s so quiet.
-Yeah, well, it’s early yet.

193
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:18,093
Most folks are just waking up.
It’s usually pretty quiet even then.

194
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:37,404
That’s Ernie Cole’s place.
He’s our druggist and mayor.

195
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,739
Lost two boys in the war.

196
00:20:39,948 --> 00:20:43,952
Joe at Anzio and Willy at Bastogne.

197
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:48,957
-They were good boys, both of them.
-There’s so many.

198
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:52,252
All told, this town gave 62...

199
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:55,797
...of its young men to the war.

200
00:20:56,006 --> 00:20:59,884
More than our share.
17 of them at Normandy alone.

201
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,971
Even got a letter from Roosevelt.

202
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,266
They commissioned this town
a war memorial.

203
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:10,645
Been in the basement of the town hall
for years now.

204
00:21:10,854 --> 00:21:13,940
Folks never had the heart
to put it up.

205
00:21:14,149 --> 00:21:16,776
Mabel over at that diner...

206
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:22,657
...her husband Max was killed
in action on Okinawa.

207
00:21:24,868 --> 00:21:30,749
Say, son?
The woman does wonders with an egg.

208
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:36,463
-You hungry?
-Yes. Very.

209
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:45,513
Doc Stanton pops in every morning
on his way to the office.

210
00:21:45,722 --> 00:21:49,142
Let’s have breakfast while we wait.

211
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:57,317
Morning, Mabel.

212
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,197
-My gosh.
-Doc been by yet?

213
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:06,701
He should be along any moment.
Has there been an accident?

214
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:12,624
I found him down by the wash. He was
lying there like a landed trout.

215
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:13,833
Who is he?

216
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,545
We’re still working on that.
The boy could use a meal.

217
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:20,507
Are those eggs spoken for?

218
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:25,011
-Harry, you mind?
-No, not at all. I can wait.

219
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,274
You trying to set a record?

220
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:45,782
-It’s good.
-Like you could tell.

221
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:54,582
-Have you ever been in here before?
-I’d remember these eggs.

222
00:22:54,791 --> 00:23:00,255
-It’s just that you look sort of--
-Familiar? I said the same thing.

223
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:04,426
Hello, Stan. Mabel.
My bear claw ready to go?

224
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:07,470
There’s someone you should
say hello to.

225
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,556
Hello, son.

226
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:14,561
-How’d that happen?
-I have no idea.

227
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:24,237
Perhaps you better come along with me.
Let me take a closer look at you.

228
00:23:34,664 --> 00:23:38,168
-On my tab?
-Of course.

229
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:45,300
Food was wonderful. Thank you.

230
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:47,385
My pleasure.

231
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:50,847
Come again.

232
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:55,935
Watch your step, son.

233
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:15,121
Follow my finger. Just with your eyes.

234
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:18,041
That’s it.

235
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:32,013
Muriel, call the sheriff.
Tell him we could use him.

236
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:37,018
-Yes, doctor.
-So? Doc?

237
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,396
What do you think?

238
00:24:39,604 --> 00:24:44,567
-I think he looks strangely--
-Familiar?

239
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,740
-I’m getting that a lot lately.
-That’s what Mabel and I said.

240
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:56,871
-Vexing, isn’t it?
-Aside from vexing, how am I?

241
00:24:57,038 --> 00:25:00,583
You took a pretty good knock
on the head.

242
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:03,503
Good news is, you’ll live.

243
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,881
Go ahead and put your shirt--

244
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,177
Better yet-- Excuse me, Stan.

245
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,763
Take one of mine.

246
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:17,517
Big, but it’s clean.

247
00:25:20,103 --> 00:25:23,690
That’s very kind. Thank you.

248
00:25:32,157 --> 00:25:36,411
-She’s very pretty.
-That’s my daughter, Adele.

249
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:38,663
My pride and joy.

250
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,375
Charms the fish right
out of the river, she does.

251
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:49,341
Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare.

252
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,386
It’s just that your face
really does seem familiar.

253
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:02,103
Wish I could say the same thing.

254
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,787
Cecil! Cecil, listen to me.

255
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:22,666
Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack
right here?

256
00:26:22,874 --> 00:26:26,586
-There’s a young man--
-I know, I’m here to investigate.

257
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:30,131
Anything interesting
will be in the paper--

258
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,134
Listen to me! It’s Luke.

259
00:26:36,763 --> 00:26:41,976
You have no recollection
prior to waking up on our beach?

260
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,230
No idea who you are
or how you got here?

261
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:51,027
I remember a dog licking my face.

262
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,238
Before that...

263
00:26:55,615 --> 00:26:56,616
...blank.

264
00:26:57,325 --> 00:27:01,496
There’s someone who might be able
to shed light on this.

265
00:27:01,705 --> 00:27:05,000
-Is it okay if I bring him in?
-Please.

266
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,410
It is you.

267
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:44,873
It is.

268
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:50,503
Oh, Luke. I never gave up hoping.

269
00:27:50,712 --> 00:27:56,384
You’re alive! My boy! God!

270
00:27:58,762 --> 00:28:01,222
My son.

271
00:28:15,278 --> 00:28:17,864
Break it to her gently.

272
00:28:22,202 --> 00:28:23,828
Sir?

273
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:28,875
-What did you say your name was?
-Harry.

274
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,587
Harry Trimble. And you’re Luke.

275
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:36,424
Everybody’s called you Luke
since you were a baby.

276
00:28:37,676 --> 00:28:40,595
Where exactly are we going?

277
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:45,266
Where do you think, son?
I’m taking you home.

278
00:28:46,434 --> 00:28:48,937
You fellas have a good rest
of the day.

279
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:54,234
-If you need anything, call me.
-Bless you, Cecil, for everything.

280
00:29:06,037 --> 00:29:08,164
What are we doing here?

281
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,917
This is it.

282
00:29:16,214 --> 00:29:18,717
"Hem Jesti."

283
00:29:18,925 --> 00:29:21,302
The Majestic.

284
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:24,806
A few of the letters are missing.

285
00:29:27,142 --> 00:29:28,977
We live in a movie theater?

286
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:33,815
No. In the apartment above it.

287
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,211
Harry?

288
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:00,383
How long have I been gone?

289
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:03,511
Nine and a half years.

290
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:11,478
Nine and a half years?

291
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:18,485
That was high school.

292
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:22,030
You ran 11 touchdowns that season.

293
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,207
My mother?

294
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,959
You remember?

295
00:30:36,252 --> 00:30:39,881
Just a guess.

296
00:30:42,717 --> 00:30:48,056
-She’s beautiful.
-Yes, she was, rest her soul.

297
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:59,901
I’m sorry. It’s so much to take in.

298
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:03,571
Me blathering away like a fool.

299
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,575
Why don’t I make some coffee?

300
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:40,734
Harry, why did you close The Majestic?

301
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:45,864
After the war, people here just
didn’t feel like going to the movies.

302
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:50,243
Some moved away. Los Angeles...

303
00:31:50,452 --> 00:31:54,039
...Sacramento, San Francisco.

304
00:31:54,247 --> 00:31:57,125
You still take cream, no sugar?

305
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,672
Luke?

306
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,940
Just us, son.

307
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:31,279
-How long have I been asleep?
-Since yesterday.

308
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:35,283
You slept through the night
and most of this morning.

309
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,914
I’d like to reintroduce you
to the staff of The Majestic.

310
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:46,753
-Irene Terwilliger, our candy lady.
-So glad to have you back, Luke.

311
00:34:46,961 --> 00:34:48,963
He’s even more handsome now.

312
00:34:49,255 --> 00:34:53,051
This is Emmett Smith,
our head usher and fix-it man.

313
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:55,595
Tell him about the watch.

314
00:34:55,804 --> 00:34:59,933
One step at a time.
Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.

315
00:35:00,141 --> 00:35:01,685
Luke....

316
00:35:03,645 --> 00:35:08,483
Fact is, we’ve been talking it over
while you slept, and....

317
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:10,986
Well, good news, son.

318
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:15,031
Now that you’re back,
we’ve decided to reopen.

319
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,534
Reopen?

320
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:21,830
How hard can it be?
We fix the place up, sell tickets.

321
00:35:22,038 --> 00:35:24,958
Harry. Look around.

322
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,169
-It’s a dump.
-Told you so.

323
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:32,674
I am looking around,
and all I see is potential.

324
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:38,513
The place is ready to fall down. All
you’d have to do is give it a shove.

325
00:35:38,722 --> 00:35:44,394
You’re wrong. You are. I know
she doesn’t look like much now...

326
00:35:44,602 --> 00:35:47,897
...but once--
Once, this place was like a palace.

327
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:51,234
-Palace.
-That’s why we called her Majestic.

328
00:35:51,443 --> 00:35:54,946
Any man, woman, child could buy
a ticket, walk in.

329
00:35:55,155 --> 00:36:00,327
Here they’d be, here we’d be.
Yes, sir. Yes, ma’am. Enjoy the show.

330
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:04,873
In they’d come, entering a palace.
Like a dream. Like in heaven.

331
00:36:05,081 --> 00:36:08,877
Maybe you had worries and problems,
but once you came in...

332
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:13,006
...they didn’t matter anymore.
And you know why?

333
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:20,972
Chaplin, that’s why.
And Keaton, and Lloyd.

334
00:36:21,556 --> 00:36:25,935
Garbo, Gable, and Lombard.
And Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy Cagney.

335
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:29,064
Fred and Ginger. They were gods!

336
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:31,566
And they lived up there.

337
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:34,319
That was Olympus.

338
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,697
We felt so lucky just to be here.

339
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,576
To have the privilege
of watching them.

340
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:45,121
This TV thing, why stay
home and watch a box?

341
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:49,334
Convenience? You don’t have
to dress up, you can sit there?

342
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:53,421
You call that entertainment?
Alone in your living room?

343
00:36:53,588 --> 00:36:57,926
Where’s the other people?
Where’s the audience?

344
00:36:58,093 --> 00:37:00,428
Where’s the magic?

345
00:37:01,054 --> 00:37:06,559
I’ll tell you. In a place like this,
the magic is all around you.

346
00:37:06,768 --> 00:37:09,562
The trick is to see it.

347
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:12,774
Luke...

348
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:17,112
...I think you loved The Majestic
even more than I did.

349
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,657
-You’ve got to remember that.
-I don’t.

350
00:37:22,617 --> 00:37:27,288
It sounds crazy, but I promise
we can make this place like it was!

351
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:31,084
I don’t know how it was.
Don’t you get that?

352
00:37:31,292 --> 00:37:36,423
-None of this means anything to me!
-It used to mean so much.

353
00:37:36,631 --> 00:37:42,470
It doesn’t. How can it?
Harry, I don’t even know who I am.

354
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,057
No.

355
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:50,478
No.

356
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,483
Come with me.

357
00:38:02,907 --> 00:38:06,077
Bobby Rilke. Red hair and freckles.

358
00:38:06,286 --> 00:38:10,457
Always charging up and down the street
on his bike, screaming.

359
00:38:10,665 --> 00:38:14,252
Scaring the crap out
of the old ladies.

360
00:38:15,795 --> 00:38:17,922
Brad Hendersen.

361
00:38:19,132 --> 00:38:24,763
Virgil Toynbee. And Patrick Vitger.
He was on the football team with you.

362
00:38:26,723 --> 00:38:29,142
Stevie Wardlow.

363
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:33,480
His old man was a drinker,
used to beat him.

364
00:38:33,688 --> 00:38:37,150
You’d bring him home,
we’d give him a hot meal.

365
00:38:37,442 --> 00:38:41,154
Kid practically lived with us
for a few years.

366
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:47,535
He died on Saipan.
Silver Star for bravery.

367
00:38:48,828 --> 00:38:50,997
Teddy Parker.

368
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:53,041
Jimmy Trask.

369
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,671
And this boy over here...

370
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:03,218
...bright kid. Honour student.

371
00:39:03,718 --> 00:39:06,513
Joined up right after Pearl Harbor.

372
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:12,143
Parachuted into France on D-Day,
June 6th, 1944.

373
00:39:12,727 --> 00:39:18,108
Three days later, his platoon
got pinned down by German artillery.

374
00:39:18,316 --> 00:39:23,905
They were nearly wiped out. Most boys
dead or wounded, torn up by the shells.

375
00:39:24,114 --> 00:39:26,282
But this fella here...

376
00:39:26,491 --> 00:39:32,080
...carried the injured back
to safety, one by one.

377
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,625
Always going back till
all men were accounted for.

378
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:39,754
He never wavered. He just kept doing
what he had to do...

379
00:39:39,963 --> 00:39:42,465
...until it got done.

380
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:56,354
He was reported missing
in action a month later.

381
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,482
His body was never found.

382
00:40:00,108 --> 00:40:05,989
Congress gave him the Medal of Honor
for saving the lives of eight men...

383
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:08,992
...without thought to himself.

384
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:26,092
His name...

385
00:40:26,301 --> 00:40:30,472
...was Albert Lucas Trimble.

386
00:40:31,931 --> 00:40:37,520
We called him Luke. He was my son.

387
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:45,528
That’s who you are.

388
00:40:49,282 --> 00:40:52,869
-Well, I’ll be!
-Morning, Ernie.

389
00:40:53,078 --> 00:40:57,957
I heard about it, couldn’t believe it.
I had to come see for myself.

390
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,044
There he stands.
I still can’t believe it!

391
00:41:01,252 --> 00:41:04,130
-It’s really him.
-I can see that!

392
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:09,386
My God, Luke, it sure is good
to see you again.

393
00:41:10,637 --> 00:41:14,057
-Luke, this is Ernie Cole, our mayor.
-Mayor Cole.

394
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:18,645
You don’t have to go that far, son.
You can just call me Ernie.

395
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,649
-Care to join us at Mabel’s for lunch?
-I’d love it.

396
00:41:22,857 --> 00:41:24,317
Good.

397
00:41:26,194 --> 00:41:29,030
Oh, my God!

398
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:33,952
Watch your step.

399
00:41:39,958 --> 00:41:43,503
-I missed you.
-Not as much as I missed you.

400
00:41:43,712 --> 00:41:48,341
-Well? How did it go?
-Not so bad. I think I passed.

401
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:54,889
-That’s my girl! What about the....
-Hiccups? Not a trace, thank goodness.

402
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:59,978
Who wants an attorney who hiccups
when she’s nervous?

403
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:03,857
Like I always said, honey,
it’s all up here.

404
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,737
It’s so good to be home.

405
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:13,241
Dad, what is it?

406
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:19,497
-Oh, my God. Did somebody die?
-Well...

407
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:23,376
...somewhat the opposite, actually.

408
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:27,047
Look at you! Look at you!

409
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:31,801
Great to have you back, son!

410
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:40,393
Luke! Remember the time, you and me,
we were playing with firecrackers?

411
00:42:40,602 --> 00:42:45,523
One of them went off too soon
and singed all the hair off my head?

412
00:42:48,985 --> 00:42:50,945
No. What happened?

413
00:42:52,322 --> 00:42:55,950
Well, all the hair
got singed off my head.

414
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:00,246
It was pretty funny.

415
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,874
You really don’t remember?

416
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:06,628
I’m sorry.

417
00:43:07,629 --> 00:43:12,342
Heck, that’s okay. It’s good
to have you back, that’s all.

418
00:43:13,134 --> 00:43:15,095
Ain’t that right, Bob?

419
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:20,100
Luke, you remember my cousin Bob?
You two joined up the same day.

420
00:43:20,308 --> 00:43:23,061
Bob, nice to meet you.

421
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:28,149
Welcome back.

422
00:43:33,905 --> 00:43:35,865
Thank you.

423
00:43:41,246 --> 00:43:43,331
-More coffee?
-No, I’m fine.

424
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:48,420
-What are your plans?
-We’re gonna reopen The Majestic.

425
00:43:48,878 --> 00:43:51,798
-Is that right?
-We were discussing it.

426
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:56,678
That’s the spirit, fellas!
We need a little more of that.

427
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,890
Where is Spencer Wyatt?

428
00:44:01,349 --> 00:44:03,309
-Spence?
-Spencer!

429
00:44:03,518 --> 00:44:06,104
-There he is.
-Come here.

430
00:44:08,898 --> 00:44:12,819
-Hey, Luke.
-Hi, Spencer.

431
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:16,698
-Is your big band ready to play?
-Yes, sir.

432
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:18,533
What are you thinking?

433
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:24,456
This town has had a blessing of good
fortune after a long dry spell.

434
00:44:24,664 --> 00:44:27,542
I’m thinking that we ought
to celebrate.

435
00:44:28,835 --> 00:44:32,714
So, what do you say?
Saturday night, out at the point...

436
00:44:32,881 --> 00:44:36,843
...a big welcome-home celebration
for Luke.

437
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:46,353
No, it’s too much.

438
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:58,698
Luke?

439
00:45:05,705 --> 00:45:07,540
Adele?

440
00:45:11,002 --> 00:45:12,921
I saw your picture.

441
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:24,224
Do you remember me?

442
00:45:26,101 --> 00:45:29,062
No, but I’ll sure try.

443
00:45:38,863 --> 00:45:41,783
-Adele?
-Yes?

444
00:45:42,117 --> 00:45:44,661
It may just be my imagination...

445
00:45:46,246 --> 00:45:49,124
...but I feel like we’re not alone.

446
00:45:54,004 --> 00:45:57,465
Go about your business.
He’s not going anywhere.

447
00:45:57,757 --> 00:46:02,262
It’s okay, folks. Go ahead home.
And thanks for the welcome.

448
00:46:03,138 --> 00:46:06,516
You two have a lot
to catch up on, I expect.

449
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:14,607
I think we’d better--
Go on.

450
00:46:19,946 --> 00:46:22,449
You handled that well.

451
00:46:22,657 --> 00:46:23,992
Thanks.

452
00:46:25,493 --> 00:46:29,164
So, where to?

453
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:39,215
Town hall?

454
00:46:42,177 --> 00:46:43,803
Come on.

455
00:46:48,558 --> 00:46:50,518
You first.

456
00:46:51,269 --> 00:46:52,520
Why me?

457
00:46:52,729 --> 00:46:56,107
In case the vicious guard dogs
haven’t been fed.

458
00:46:56,941 --> 00:47:00,737
So you can be a gentleman
and help me down.

459
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,500
Careful.

460
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:16,002
There you go.

461
00:47:20,423 --> 00:47:22,384
I got you.

462
00:47:36,523 --> 00:47:39,150
Big, gloomy basement.

463
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,277
Nice.

464
00:47:41,486 --> 00:47:45,740
It was a lot roomier before they put
the monument down here.

465
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:54,457
The gift from Roosevelt.
Stan Keller told me about it.

466
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,932
Your name’s on there.

467
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:14,894
So are the others.

468
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,564
I knew all these guys?

469
00:48:18,773 --> 00:48:20,567
We both did.

470
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:26,323
We went to school with most of them.
You really don’t remember?

471
00:48:32,537 --> 00:48:34,456
I’m sorry.

472
00:48:34,789 --> 00:48:37,751
We used to sneak in here
when we were kids.

473
00:48:37,959 --> 00:48:41,504
This was our secret place.

474
00:48:41,713 --> 00:48:45,133
You, me, Stevie Wardlow...

475
00:48:46,134 --> 00:48:48,345
...Tully Wentworth.

476
00:48:53,308 --> 00:48:58,063
-That’s why you brought me here?
-It’s a stroll down memory lane.

477
00:48:58,271 --> 00:49:01,149
Dad said if I took you places
we used to go...

478
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:06,655
...and showed you things only we knew
about, it might help you remember.

479
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:11,034
So we’re here for...

480
00:49:11,242 --> 00:49:14,454
...purely medical reasons?

481
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:18,583
Not entirely.

482
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:23,171
I’m trying to make up my own mind
about you being Luke.

483
00:49:23,505 --> 00:49:26,132
Join the club.

484
00:49:27,008 --> 00:49:29,636
So, what do you think?

485
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:32,347
The jury’s still out.

486
00:49:33,515 --> 00:49:36,059
Fair enough.

487
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:42,315
Any other secret places
I should know about?

488
00:49:48,029 --> 00:49:51,533
-Really, it fueled my dream.
-That can’t be true.

489
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:54,160
I’m serious.

490
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:58,748
You’ll have to start making sense
sometime soon.

491
00:49:58,957 --> 00:50:02,669
You wanted to be a lawyer because
of The Majestic?

492
00:50:02,877 --> 00:50:05,714
We used to go
to the movies all the time.

493
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:10,593
Once, when I was 11, the movie playing
was The Life of Emile Zola.

494
00:50:10,802 --> 00:50:13,763
About the Dreyfus affair.
Great picture.

495
00:50:13,972 --> 00:50:18,101
You remember movies,
but you don’t remember your life?

496
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,397
Yeah.

497
00:50:23,898 --> 00:50:27,902
-Weird, huh?
-It’s unbelievable.

498
00:50:28,236 --> 00:50:34,367
In the movie, Zola stood up in court
and accused the French government...

499
00:50:34,576 --> 00:50:38,788
...of forfeiting its honor
for wrongly accusing an innocent man.

500
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:44,544
Zola wasn’t a lawyer, of course,
but the way he spoke....

501
00:50:45,003 --> 00:50:48,757
I decided right then
that’s what I wanted to be.

502
00:50:48,965 --> 00:50:53,094
-Just from that?
-Just? Come on, it was great!

503
00:50:53,303 --> 00:50:58,433
"In the presence of this tribunal,
the representative of human justice...

504
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:03,229
...before you, gentlemen of the jury,
before France, before the world...

505
00:51:03,438 --> 00:51:05,899
...I swear that Dreyfus is innocent!

506
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:10,362
By all I’ve won, all I’ve written
to spread the spirit of France...

507
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:12,739
...I swear, Dreyfus is innocent."

508
00:51:12,947 --> 00:51:18,078
"May all that melt away, may my name
perish if Dreyfus not be innocent."

509
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:21,122
"He is innocent."

510
00:51:22,290 --> 00:51:24,417
It’s pretty good stuff, huh?

511
00:51:25,794 --> 00:51:27,587
Not bad at all.

512
00:51:31,299 --> 00:51:35,136
The sun’s going. Come on.

513
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,029
Watch your eyes.

514
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:16,636
-Is this another secret place?
-Our special one.

515
00:52:18,179 --> 00:52:22,434
We used to come up here all the time
to watch the sunset.

516
00:52:25,770 --> 00:52:28,231
And that’s what made it special?

517
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,112
This is also where we had
our first kiss.

518
00:52:36,197 --> 00:52:38,575
We were 14.

519
00:52:43,121 --> 00:52:44,789
That is special.

520
00:52:45,623 --> 00:52:48,335
Wish I could remember that.

521
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:51,963
Me too.

522
00:52:54,007 --> 00:52:56,551
We were in love, weren’t we?

523
00:52:57,552 --> 00:52:59,471
Yeah.

524
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,355
-What was that?
-Nothing.

525
00:53:08,563 --> 00:53:12,317
-I’m fine. Really.
-You don’t sound fine.

526
00:53:12,525 --> 00:53:15,403
Just ignore it. It’s going away.

527
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:22,202
So were we gonna be married?

528
00:53:22,410 --> 00:53:25,205
When you got back from overseas.

529
00:53:25,705 --> 00:53:29,584
We were engaged
just before you shipped out.

530
00:53:30,085 --> 00:53:32,879
Anything I can do
to help you with that?

531
00:53:34,422 --> 00:53:38,510
Yeah. But it’s something
that only we knew about.

532
00:53:38,718 --> 00:53:43,723
-Tell me.
-No. I think I’d rather die first.

533
00:53:43,932 --> 00:53:47,727
Your father said any little thing
could jog my memory.

534
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:12,752
It still works.

535
00:55:29,120 --> 00:55:33,166
-Found me.
-Sorry. I didn’t know who was here.

536
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,960
Just me and the dog.

537
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:41,341
-What’s his name?
-Dog.

538
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:45,387
-Simple. I like it.
-Come on in.

539
00:55:57,816 --> 00:56:04,072
-Is that you? In the first World War?
-Yeah. 1917, thereabouts.

540
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:08,243
-It’s okay with you that I live here?
-Why wouldn’t it be?

541
00:56:08,743 --> 00:56:13,164
Just checking.
Think I’ll get me a watch?

542
00:56:13,581 --> 00:56:17,293
Right, the watch. What’s that for?

543
00:56:17,502 --> 00:56:23,008
So I make sure the shows always start
on time. That’s important.

544
00:56:23,216 --> 00:56:27,262
-I’ll see what I can do.
-Thank you.

545
00:56:27,762 --> 00:56:31,182
I had me a nice watch once.

546
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:35,020
The pocket watch kind, with a chain.

547
00:56:35,228 --> 00:56:38,565
Kept good time until it broke.

548
00:56:38,773 --> 00:56:41,901
Never had the money to get it fixed.

549
00:56:42,110 --> 00:56:46,239
By then, the theater closed down,
I didn’t think I needed it.

550
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:49,075
I put it away somewhere
for safekeeping.

551
00:56:49,451 --> 00:56:52,162
But that was years ago...

552
00:56:52,370 --> 00:56:55,332
...and I can’t remember where.

553
00:56:55,540 --> 00:57:00,879
Lost me a medal for bravery once too,
back during the Great War.

554
00:57:01,087 --> 00:57:05,967
Lost it in the hospital, I think.

555
00:57:06,676 --> 00:57:09,429
I forget things sometimes...

556
00:57:10,472 --> 00:57:13,099
...since the war.

557
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:16,144
Yeah...

558
00:57:16,978 --> 00:57:19,105
...me too.

559
00:57:22,025 --> 00:57:25,612
Trash. Vile, despicable trash.

560
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:30,075
It’s about the West Virginia
coal miners’ strike of 1920.

561
00:57:30,283 --> 00:57:33,578
The plight of the downtrodden worker
and all that.

562
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:37,290
-Communist propaganda, start to end.
-That bad?

563
00:57:37,499 --> 00:57:40,960
There’s a dog in it I like,
but aside from that....

564
00:57:41,169 --> 00:57:44,923
-Tell me about Appleton.
-His agent reported him missing.

565
00:57:45,131 --> 00:57:47,634
He’s been gone four or five days.

566
00:57:47,842 --> 00:57:52,472
Four or five days? Gentlemen, we may
be onto something here.

567
00:57:52,681 --> 00:57:55,809
What kind of man hides
after being implicated?

568
00:57:56,017 --> 00:58:00,146
Not an innocent one. What if Appleton
is more than he seems?

569
00:58:00,355 --> 00:58:04,651
Not just another schmuck, but an
important Communist operative.

570
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:08,279
One with lots of secrets to spill.

571
00:58:08,488 --> 00:58:12,534
The Reds would do anything
to keep him out of our hands.

572
00:58:14,285 --> 00:58:16,871
We have one of two scenarios here.

573
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:22,836
Number one: His Communist friends
killed him to shut him up.

574
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:30,719
Number two: They’re trying to get him
out of the country as we speak.

575
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:35,515
I don’t intend
to open a copy of Pravda...

576
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:38,893
...and see him get a hero’s welcome
in Red Square.

577
00:58:39,102 --> 00:58:44,065
-What shall we tell Mr. Hoover?
-Tell him this has top priority.

578
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:50,572
You find him. Living or dead.

579
00:58:50,739 --> 00:58:52,949
Whatever it takes.

580
00:58:53,158 --> 00:58:56,369
His trail will lead us
to a nest of Communists...

581
00:58:56,578 --> 00:59:01,333
...that will make the Rosenbergs look
like Ma and Pa Kettle.

582
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:05,420
Adele!

583
00:59:05,587 --> 00:59:07,255
Got it!

584
00:59:11,926 --> 00:59:13,803
Hi.

585
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:22,312
-Do I have a stain? What?
-Nothing.

586
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:25,690
Seeing you there gave me
a weird feeling.

587
00:59:26,441 --> 00:59:30,570
-You wore that when we last went out.
-I could go change it.

588
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:35,075
-Don’t be silly. It still fits.
-You kids ready?

589
00:59:36,618 --> 00:59:37,869
Shall we?

590
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:53,176
-Good evening.
-How are you?

591
00:59:55,136 --> 00:59:56,388
-Hi.
-Good evening.

592
00:59:56,596 --> 00:59:59,391
Smells good. I caught it from here.

593
01:00:21,830 --> 01:00:23,748
Luke’s here!

594
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,584
Here he comes! Here he comes!

595
01:00:26,793 --> 01:00:28,628
I’ll be right back.

596
01:00:33,091 --> 01:00:36,678
Hey, buddy. We’ll take it from here.

597
01:01:12,547 --> 01:01:14,966
I’ll get you for that.

598
01:01:15,383 --> 01:01:20,347
I think Luke and Adele should lead
the first dance, don’t you?

599
01:01:41,284 --> 01:01:43,620
Care to dance?

600
01:01:44,579 --> 01:01:47,207
I think we’d better.

601
01:02:19,406 --> 01:02:21,658
You’re pretty good.

602
01:02:21,908 --> 01:02:23,410
Thanks.

603
01:02:23,994 --> 01:02:25,620
You too.

604
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:30,375
When did you learn to dance?

605
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:50,437
That was nerve-racking.

606
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:54,774
I’d kill that Spencer kid,
except he’s really good.

607
01:02:55,066 --> 01:02:59,112
-Looks like your investment paid off.
-Investment?

608
01:02:59,321 --> 01:03:02,532
In high school,
you saved up for a clarinet.

609
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:06,244
You wanted to be Benny Goodman
in the worst way.

610
01:03:06,453 --> 01:03:08,788
-And?
-You were Benny Goodman...

611
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:11,416
...in the worst way.

612
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:14,377
You gave the clarinet to Spencer.

613
01:03:14,586 --> 01:03:19,341
He used to drive you crazy, following
you around like a lost puppy.

614
01:03:19,549 --> 01:03:24,095
I gave him the clarinet. He started
practicing and left me alone.

615
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:28,808
-Did you remember that, or...?
-Just filling in the blanks.

616
01:03:58,129 --> 01:04:00,590
Aren’t they a sight?

617
01:04:01,216 --> 01:04:03,677
So they are, Harry.

618
01:04:04,678 --> 01:04:06,888
Something wrong?

619
01:04:14,938 --> 01:04:17,273
Something is troubling me.

620
01:04:17,482 --> 01:04:20,402
What could trouble you
on a night like this?

621
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:24,364
Just look. Your daughter,
dancing with my son.

622
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:28,618
Everything the way it should be.
God’s in his heaven, Ben.

623
01:04:28,827 --> 01:04:33,665
Still, I can’t help wondering,
where has Luke been all this time?

624
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:38,753
-I mean, 9 1/2 years!
-What’s it matter? He’s home now.

625
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:41,923
He went missing during the war, right?

626
01:04:42,132 --> 01:04:46,928
So he must have been injured overseas,
lost his memory then.

627
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:52,100
So, what happened when he came back,
not knowing who he was?

628
01:04:52,309 --> 01:04:56,479
Did he start a new life for himself?
Career?

629
01:04:56,688 --> 01:05:02,402
What if Luke spent the last decade
actually thinking he’s somebody else?

630
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,989
I don’t care.
I care about his life here.

631
01:05:06,197 --> 01:05:10,201
But don’t you see?
He might have people looking for him.

632
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:14,581
People who care about him.
Maybe even a wife and family.

633
01:05:15,582 --> 01:05:19,586
You could be a grandfather
and not even know it.

634
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:25,717
I’m not trying to step on your joy.
My joy too.

635
01:05:26,301 --> 01:05:30,013
But what happens
if his memory does come back?

636
01:05:30,221 --> 01:05:32,974
Which life will he remember?

637
01:05:33,642 --> 01:05:35,769
Which would he choose?

638
01:06:01,419 --> 01:06:06,132
-So are you proud of your boy, Avery?
-What?

639
01:06:06,758 --> 01:06:10,178
Oh, yeah!
I couldn’t be any more proud, Ernie.

640
01:06:10,387 --> 01:06:14,975
I think Spencer’s got a big future
ahead of him. What do you say?

641
01:06:21,356 --> 01:06:25,026
You know, folks, here in Lawson...

642
01:06:25,235 --> 01:06:28,446
...we gave a lot to our country.
A lot.

643
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:31,908
And we never complained.

644
01:06:32,117 --> 01:06:34,995
And we never faltered.

645
01:06:35,203 --> 01:06:38,039
And we never forgot.

646
01:06:40,041 --> 01:06:42,585
We never forgot.

647
01:06:43,044 --> 01:06:46,464
And so, when one of our own...

648
01:06:46,673 --> 01:06:49,342
...came back to us,
it was like a miracle.

649
01:06:49,551 --> 01:06:51,177
Luke...

650
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:56,850
...seeing you walk down the street,
it was....

651
01:06:57,559 --> 01:07:01,521
It was kind of like seeing one
of my own boys alive again.

652
01:07:02,314 --> 01:07:06,526
I think I speak for all of us here
when I say...

653
01:07:06,735 --> 01:07:09,029
...that not a day goes by...

654
01:07:09,237 --> 01:07:13,074
...that we don’t keep
our boys’ memories alive.

655
01:07:13,783 --> 01:07:17,746
But, Luke, having you back among us...

656
01:07:18,163 --> 01:07:21,916
...that helps us keep
their spirits alive too.

657
01:07:22,208 --> 01:07:25,879
God bless you, son. God bless you.

658
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:35,555
Now, on a lighter note...

659
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:39,809
...we’ve had a special request
from one of Lawson’s luminaries...

660
01:07:40,018 --> 01:07:44,147
...Irene Terwilliger.
Irene, come up here.

661
01:07:46,358 --> 01:07:48,234
There you are.

662
01:07:50,070 --> 01:07:52,614
I’ve tutored music in this town...

663
01:07:52,822 --> 01:07:56,076
...for more years than I care to say.

664
01:07:56,993 --> 01:08:02,332
In fact, many of you here tonight have
been my students through the years.

665
01:08:02,540 --> 01:08:05,585
And as talented as you all were...

666
01:08:05,794 --> 01:08:09,089
...the most talented pupil
I ever taught...

667
01:08:09,464 --> 01:08:12,300
...was Luke Trimble.

668
01:08:20,141 --> 01:08:24,229
Luke, you played the piano
like an angel.

669
01:08:24,437 --> 01:08:28,400
It would do my heart a world of good
to hear you play again.

670
01:08:28,608 --> 01:08:30,694
Won’t you come up?

671
01:08:30,902 --> 01:08:33,530
-Yes, come up!
-Come on!

672
01:08:33,738 --> 01:08:35,031
Come.

673
01:08:40,829 --> 01:08:46,167
-You never told me about the piano.
-Go. Anything could jog your memory.

674
01:08:49,671 --> 01:08:51,506
That’s right.

675
01:09:08,648 --> 01:09:13,653
I’m not sure I remember ever playing.

676
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:19,200
Music is in the soul, Luke.
Just put your fingers on the keys...

677
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,037
...and let it all come back to you.

678
01:09:22,245 --> 01:09:27,584
Franz Liszt. Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.

679
01:09:33,923 --> 01:09:36,760

680
01:09:48,396 --> 01:09:50,398
Now you.

681
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:29,789
Really, Luke! That’s no way
to treat Mr. Liszt. Stop that!

682
01:11:30,498 --> 01:11:32,792
Stop it, I say!

683
01:11:33,001 --> 01:11:37,005
Who taught you to play like that?
I demand to know!

684
01:11:37,213 --> 01:11:40,633
Where did you learn
to play such a thing?

685
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:44,638
I taught him that!
When you weren’t looking.

686
01:12:12,999 --> 01:12:16,002
-I think Spencer was loopy.
-No.

687
01:12:16,211 --> 01:12:20,423
He was blowing some bad notes
there at the end.

688
01:12:46,241 --> 01:12:48,201
Good night.

689
01:12:50,328 --> 01:12:52,163
Good night.

690
01:13:30,076 --> 01:13:32,203
Bob?

691
01:13:36,541 --> 01:13:39,502
Bob Leffert.
You work for Mabel at the diner.

692
01:13:39,711 --> 01:13:43,423
That’s who I am.
Question is, who are you?

693
01:13:43,631 --> 01:13:48,219
-I’m not sure what you mean.
-I knew Luke Trimble.

694
01:13:48,511 --> 01:13:50,764
I didn’t like him much.

695
01:13:50,972 --> 01:13:54,517
Not saying he’s bad,
just rubbed me the wrong way.

696
01:13:54,934 --> 01:14:00,273
You know the feeling? Someone rubs you
the wrong way, you can’t explain why?

697
01:14:00,482 --> 01:14:05,111
You kind of rub me that way.
Not that that makes you Luke.

698
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:09,741
What I want to know is, what game
are you running? Who are you?

699
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:13,578
Just a guy
trying to figure things out.

700
01:14:13,953 --> 01:14:17,040
This town’s had enough heartbreak.

701
01:14:17,707 --> 01:14:19,668
Too much.

702
01:14:20,168 --> 01:14:23,963
Me, I think you’re setting
everybody up for more.

703
01:14:26,925 --> 01:14:29,344
I hope I’m wrong.

704
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:32,847
I haven’t had to kill anybody
since the war.

705
01:14:38,311 --> 01:14:40,939
Why didn’t you dance with her?

706
01:14:41,982 --> 01:14:44,067
Excuse me?

707
01:14:45,402 --> 01:14:48,947
Mabel. Why didn’t you dance with her?

708
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:53,201
Seems to me, a pretty girl asks you
to dance and you say no...

709
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:56,830
...you came home more crippled
than you thought.

710
01:15:06,798 --> 01:15:08,466
Hero.

711
01:15:27,235 --> 01:15:29,321
Welcome home, Luke.

712
01:17:00,453 --> 01:17:03,915
This was the first movie
we ever showed here.

713
01:17:04,207 --> 01:17:07,335
Your mother loved it.
I bought the print.

714
01:17:08,128 --> 01:17:10,839
Cost us our first month’s profits.

715
01:17:10,964 --> 01:17:13,758
That was back in 1925.

716
01:17:14,634 --> 01:17:17,804
Before sound.
You were just a little kid then.

717
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:22,976
Dad, I...

718
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:27,147
What?

719
01:17:26,313 --> 01:17:31,943
That’s the first time you’ve called me
Dad since you’ve been back.

720
01:17:41,328 --> 01:17:45,498
You know--

721
01:18:09,397 --> 01:18:11,191
Harry.

722
01:18:13,443 --> 01:18:15,528
Dad.

723
01:18:17,489 --> 01:18:18,740
Wake up.

724
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:23,703
-What time is it?
-6:30.

725
01:18:23,870 --> 01:18:25,914
I thought we’d get an early start.

726
01:18:27,415 --> 01:18:29,292
Candy counter.

727
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:42,222
Display wiring needs help.

728
01:18:44,683 --> 01:18:45,976
Should have stayed in bed.
