this anymore awkward
than it already is--

170
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:51,790
Really?
What?

171
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,492
Darren, we've been broken up
for a few months now.

172
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,794
Really?

173
00:09:55,796 --> 00:09:58,396
Yes.

174
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,966
Well, you must've said
something, come on in, man.

175
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,767
Hey, honey, Neal's here.

176
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:06,004
I'm not saying come down,
I'm just saying

00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,406
I'm not asking you to.

179
00:10:08,408 --> 00:10:09,808
JILLIAN: What?

180
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,676
Nothing.

181
00:10:11,678 --> 00:10:12,777
Where are the kids?

182
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:13,979
Oh, they're at their
grandparents.

183
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,380
Adults only tonight.

184
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,214
Really?

185
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:18,416
Anything you want to do.

186
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,517
Orgy?

187
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,720
Anything within reason.

188
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:24,222
Give me $10,000.

189
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,023
No.

190
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,725
$20,000.
No.

191
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:30,629
and I have given you
three pretty
good suggestions.

192
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:33,531
Well, comparatively the orgy
would be good,

193
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,934
because I will be
sleeping with your sister.

194
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:37,402
No, I don't want to have sex
with my sister.

195
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:40,705
Yeah, I know, only
I get to do that.

196
00:10:40,707 --> 00:10:42,140
You talking about me?

197
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,241
Talking about having sex.

198
00:10:43,243 --> 00:10:44,909
With me?
Yeah, having sex with you.

199
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:46,344
Damn right you do.

200
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,747
And I love it.

201
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:50,015
Fantastic.
Yeah.

202
00:10:50,017 --> 00:10:51,049
Happy birthday, bro.

203
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,251
Got you something
for the party.

204
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:54,252
Aw.

205
00:10:54,254 --> 00:10:55,620
Yeah.

206
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:03,461
The chicken was great, dear.

207
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,929
Thank you.

208
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:08,333
Is anyone else
coming to this thing?

209
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:11,636
Supposedly.

210
00:11:11,638 --> 00:11:15,173
It's no big deal, I just
cooked this amazing meal,

211
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,574
and sent the kids away,

212
00:11:16,576 --> 00:11:19,577
and spent the whole day
cleaning the house but--

213
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:26,084
Well, the three of us
are having a great time.

214
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:32,757
Oh, Neal, you know
who I was thinking of?

215
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,792
No.

216
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,994
Do you remember
Professor Henry?

217
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,462
Yeah.

218
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,397
That guy was nuts.

219
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,601
Yeah.

220
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,275
Happy birthday--
Let's just clean up.

221
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:51,276
Please.

222
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,911
Okay.

223
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:53,912
DARREN: So Professor Henry

224
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,613
was this crazy old history
professor

225
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:58,316
He worked in the White House
under Kennedy.

226
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:01,486
Anyway, he was
giving us this lecture
once on Kissinger.

227
00:12:01,488 --> 00:12:04,422
And this girl raises
her hand and asks him
if he knew Kissinger,

228
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,726
and he goes, "Knew him?
I shat on his chest!"

229
00:12:09,428 --> 00:12:10,528
JILLIAN: Gross.

230
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,731
(Door closes off screen)

231
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,135
Neal?

232
00:12:23,642 --> 00:12:25,510
And I'm like, why would
I fake heartburn.

233
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,513
Holy shit, are you getting
ready to fuck your guitar?

234
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:30,749
Yeah, do you want us to
come back some other time?

235
00:12:30,751 --> 00:12:32,250
Thanks for coming
to my birthday party.

236
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,752
Was that tonight?
Yes.

237
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:38,056
Guys, I just sat there,
with my sister and Darren.

238
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,357
Nobody showed up?

239
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:42,861
Seriously though,
what's with the underwear?

240
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44,062
Christine came over.

241
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:45,063
Holy shit.
Great.

242
00:12:45,065 --> 00:12:46,731
She found the engagement ring.

243
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,766
Great.
Holy shit.

244
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:48,967
Oh, and I quit my job.

245
00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:49,968
Great.
Holy shit.

246
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,136
Can you please
stop doing that?

247
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,937
What happened with Christine?

248
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,072
She kissed me.

249
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:55,640
So, you're guys
are back together.

250
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:57,175
No, she said she didn't
want to cheat.

251
00:12:57,177 --> 00:12:58,376
Wait, she cheated.

252
00:12:58,378 --> 00:13:00,278
Yes, and then, I left
Jillian's house

253
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,281
because no one came
to my birthday party.

254
00:13:03,283 --> 00:13:04,783
BARRY: Yeah,
I would hate that.

255
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,050
And so, I'm in my underwear.

256
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,352
BARRY: You're out of beer.

257
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:08,787
Make yourself at home Barry.

258
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,288
BARRY: Done.
Great.

259
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,690
Okay, so you could probably
use a little cheering up?

260
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,160
From the two guys
who can't even
make it to my party?

261
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,594
Hey, can I drink this?

262
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:20,465
Well, we have the greatest
birthday gift for you.

263
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:21,599
Yeah, look, just bear with us,

264
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:23,067
because
what we're gonna tell you

265
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:24,702
is going to sound crazy
at first, but trust me,

266
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:25,804
it is genius.

267
00:13:25,806 --> 00:13:27,605
If I said no, would it
make a difference?

268
00:13:27,607 --> 00:13:30,175
We're gonna to get you back
into the dating game.

269
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,209
No, come on.

270
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:33,077
No, no, just listen.

271
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:35,079
What I have in mind
will almost assuredly

272
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:37,816
get you laid,
and at the very least

273
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:38,917
will get you a handy.

274
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,018
A hand job?

275
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,119
Really?

276
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,720
Do people still do that?

277
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,022
Yes!

278
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,590
Just fucking
show him, Barry.

279
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:46,591
A hand job?

280
00:13:46,593 --> 00:13:47,826
No, the thing.

281
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,227
Oh, yeah.
Check this out.

282
00:13:51,897 --> 00:13:54,299
An internet date.
Really?

283
00:13:54,301 --> 00:13:56,334
Shut the fuck up please
and trust me.

284
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:00,939
Oh, I get it.

285
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:02,640
Casual encounters.
Great.

286
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:03,842
Better.

287
00:14:03,844 --> 00:14:05,410
Casual encounters is where
desperate people

288
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,945
who are looking to get
laid meet up.

289
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,147
Those are two desperate people
having meaningless sex.

290
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,815
I mean,
where's the fun in that?

291
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,350
Do I really need to tell you?

292
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:14,719
No, no, no, I have
something better.

293
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,254
Missed Connections.

294
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,459
See, these people
are beyond desperate.

295
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:23,928
They're so obsessed
with the idea of making

296
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,430
any sort of human connection,

297
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:27,465
that they put
all of their faith in destiny,

298
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:29,467
and they post it out
on the internet.

299
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,468
Like this.

300
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,872
We were driving
northbound on the 5.

301
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,641
I was in a black pick-up,
you were in a red hybrid.

302
00:14:36,643 --> 00:14:37,876
You caught my eye.

303
00:14:37,878 --> 00:14:39,878
I hope to hear from you.

304
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,279
You see.

305
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,981
No.
Dude.

306
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:46,084
This girl was so turned on,
so aroused by even

307
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:48,086
the sight of this
fucking guy,

308
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,153
that she goes to a website

309
00:14:49,155 --> 00:14:50,788
where people sell
used couches,

310
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:53,091
on the off-chance
that the same guy
is going to see

311
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:54,959
that same website
and write her back.

312
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:59,597
She's got to know that the odds
of that are a million to one.

313
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,598
But...

314
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,968
what if he actually
did write her back?

315
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,203
She'd probably go insane.

316
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,405
Yep, she probably would.

317
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,510
So you are going
to write her back.

318
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:14,012
What?
But I'm not the guy.

319
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,314
You're not the guy,
but here's the beauty part.

320
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:17,482
You don't have to be.

321
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,183
You write her back
as the guy.

322
00:15:19,185 --> 00:15:21,319
You tell her to meet you
somewhere.

323
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,820
That guy's not gonna show up.

324
00:15:22,822 --> 00:15:27,525
You go and you watch
as her disappointment grows.

325
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:31,829
And then she is at her most
vulnerable, her most exposed.

326
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:35,133
You walk over to her and say,
"Hey, what's wrong?"

327
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:37,735
as her new knight
in shining armor.

328
00:15:37,737 --> 00:15:39,437
And she's gonna
take all that emotion,

329
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,939
all that anticipation

330
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,907
and she's gonna
transfer it into you.

331
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:45,310
Whoa.

332
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:46,611
I know.
It's crazy, right?

333
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,047
I mean, when girls are
at their absolute lowest point,

334
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:50,148
they will fuck you.

335
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,649
That's just science.

336
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,750
Wow.

337
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,252
Does this actually work?

338
00:15:54,254 --> 00:15:56,020
I have no idea,
we're gonna find out.

339
00:15:56,022 --> 00:16:01,059
No. But I mean, you know,
it seems like
it would work, right?

340
00:16:01,061 --> 00:16:02,160
I don't know, guys.

341
00:16:02,162 --> 00:16:03,661
I mean, it sounds
really great in theory,

342
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:05,229
but I don't know
if I could actually do this.

343
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:06,331
Well, we thought
you might say that,

344
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,598
so we already
set one up for you.

345
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,133
What?
We gotta be there
in like 10 minutes.

346
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,268
No, no, guys.

347
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,235
I don't know anything
about this person.

348
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,270
There's nothing
you need to know

349
00:16:12,272 --> 00:16:13,371
except she saw some guy
in a Prius,

350
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:14,639
and she wants to fuck.

351
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,140
She doesn't want to fuck.

352
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,843
Girls looking for nice guys
don't post ads
on the internet.

353
00:16:20,245 --> 00:16:21,279
We'll take your car.

354
00:16:21,281 --> 00:16:22,847
Can't.
I left it at work.

355
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,948
Why?

356
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:25,984
Reminds me of Christine.

357
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,251
Wow. We need
to leave right now.

358
00:16:27,253 --> 00:16:28,453
Okay, look,
just get dressed,

359
00:16:28,455 --> 00:16:29,921
we'll go down there
and check it out,

360
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:31,122
if you don't like her,
you don't have
to even talk to her.

361
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,391
No. No.
You have to talk to her.

362
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:36,494
Listen, how much more
pathetic can your day get?

363
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:38,696
I could embarrass myself
in front of some random,

364
00:16:38,698 --> 00:16:41,399
severely disappointed girl
from the internet.

365
00:16:42,901 --> 00:16:44,569
This is so stupid.

366
00:16:44,571 --> 00:16:46,404
Just relax,
it's gonna work.

367
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:47,905
How do we even know
which one is her?

368
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:49,374
There's like
10 or 11 girls here.

369
00:16:49,376 --> 00:16:50,708
That's her.

370
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,212
How do you know?

371
00:16:54,214 --> 00:16:57,015
Let's see, number one,
she reeks of desperation.

372
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,317
Number two,
she's scanning around the room

373
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:01,386
every 5 seconds
looking for somebody.

374
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:03,521
Three,
she's milking that drink.

375
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,789
She doesn't want
to order a second drink,

376
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,190
because she knows
that one drink

377
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,426
by yourself in a bar,
that's okay.

378
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:09,494
Two drinks?

379
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,796
Now you're pushing
on lush or alcoholic.

380
00:17:11,798 --> 00:17:13,931
Four, she's checking
the time constantly.

381
00:17:13,933 --> 00:17:17,835
She's thinking, he's not
that late, but he is.

382
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:18,903
Five...

383
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,939
Is there a five?
There's no five.

384
00:17:21,941 --> 00:17:23,441
There's no five, okay.

385
00:17:23,443 --> 00:17:25,343
So what, I just--
I just go over?

386
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,211
Not yet.
You gotta wait, man.

387
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,279
You got to wait until

388
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,148
she's just about
to leave, you know.

389
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,649
Till she gets to
that point where she's like,

390
00:17:31,651 --> 00:17:33,017
this was a terrible idea.

391
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:36,154
I don't why
I'm doing this, I feel silly.

392
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,755
That's when you go over.

393
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:40,358
Trust in this.

394
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,659
Trust in this?

395
00:17:41,661 --> 00:17:42,460
Yeah.

396
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:43,861
George, you have a girlfriend.

397
00:17:43,863 --> 00:17:46,464
I know. I don't get to do
cool stuff like this anymore.

398
00:17:46,466 --> 00:17:48,966
Okay. Please.
I need this.

399
00:17:48,968 --> 00:17:50,735
Shit, shit.
This is it.
She's leaving.

400
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,070
NEAL: What, now?
BARRY: Go, yes.

401
00:17:52,072 --> 00:17:53,771
I don't even,
I don't know what to say.

402
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:56,874
Just go up to her and say,
"Giving up, huh?"

403
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:57,675
That's it?

404
00:17:57,677 --> 00:17:59,010
Oh, you also
have to say, um,

405
00:17:59,012 --> 00:18:01,279
"Hey, if I was him,
I wouldn't
have stood you up,

406
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:02,380
because I'm cool."

407
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:04,182
Don't say the cool part.

408
00:18:04,184 --> 00:18:05,249
Guys, I can't--

409
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,984
I can't do this,
this is crazy.

410
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:10,388
Picture Christine and Allan,
just twisted,

411
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,889
sitting on
each other's faces.

412
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:13,291
Assholes in mouths.

413
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,692
Fingers in ears.

414
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:16,194
God knows
where their feet are.

415
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,995
All kinds of weird
oiled up shit.

416
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:18,996
Picture that.

417
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,398
Smells.
Go.

418
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,399
Why would that motivate me?

419
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,800
Just go.
Go, go, go.

420
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:25,103
Okay, okay, okay
okay, okay, okay.

421
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:36,914
Giving up?

422
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,416
What?
What?

423
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,517
Did you say something?

424
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,520
I don't--
I don't think so.

425
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,123
It sounded like
you said giving up?

426
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,025
Oh. Yeah.

427
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:52,430
I was just asking you
if you were giving up?

428
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,632
What's that
supposed to mean?

429
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,134
Nothing.
Just forget I said it.

430
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,435
Thanks.

431
00:18:57,437 --> 00:18:58,836
How could you tell that?

432
00:18:58,838 --> 00:19:02,640
How could you tell
that I was giving up?

433
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,809
Well, I don't
mean to intrude

434
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:07,845
but, you're sitting here
and you're, you know,

435
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,347
kind of playing
with your drink,

436
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:11,449
and you know,
looking around a lot,

437
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,950
and you're dressed
really nice.

438
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:14,452
So, I just, you know,
figured you were,

439
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:16,420
you know,
here to meet someone.

440
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,356
I guess,
it is pretty obvious.

441
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,725
It's not that bad.

442
00:19:20,727 --> 00:19:21,826
Thanks.

443
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:32,370
Look, um, for what it's worth,
if I was that guy,

444
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:33,638
I wouldn't have stood you up.

445
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,575
Okay, I'm gonna go.

446
00:19:37,577 --> 00:19:39,243
You, you keep up.

447
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:40,645
Hold on.

448
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,447
Have a drink with me.

449
00:19:43,449 --> 00:19:44,949
Seriously?

450
00:19:44,951 --> 00:19:46,784
Yeah.

451
00:19:46,786 --> 00:19:48,052
Okay.

452
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,156
I'm Danielle.

453
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,291
Oh, I'm Neal.

454
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:54,392
Nice to meet you.

455
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,960
It's nice to meet you.

456
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,998
What brings you out
tonight, Neal?

457
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,369
Um, it's--
it's my birthday.

458
00:20:05,371 --> 00:20:06,604
Really?
Yeah.

459
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:08,105
Happy birthday.

460
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:09,407
Thank you.

461
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:11,676
So did you get
anything nice today?

462
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:15,913
Um, well, I think
I'm talking to her.

463
00:20:17,816 --> 00:20:21,519
Wow, I'm sorry.
That's really stupid.

464
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:23,287
You're sweet.

465
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,590
Oh, well, if you--if you
think my stupid is sweet,

466
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,892
I got a boat load
of stupid for you.

467
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:28,826
Such as.

468
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,027
Um. Can I borrow
your phone?

469
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:31,429
Why?

470
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,898
So I can call my mother
and tell her I met
the girl of my dreams.

471
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:37,034
If I could rearrange
the alphabet,

472
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:40,037
I would put you
and I together.

473
00:20:40,039 --> 00:20:42,039
Yeah, is that a mirror
in your pants,

474
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,108
because I can see
myself in them?

475
00:20:47,212 --> 00:20:49,447
You know, I'm sorry.
That was also dumb.

476
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:52,250
You have nothing
to worry about.

477
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,551
Oh, okay.

478
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,719
( cell phone buzzes )

479
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:55,953
Oh, you know, I'm sorry,
I got to take this.

480
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,222
I told my friend to call me
and make sure

481
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:00,925
I wasn't in
a basement somewhere,
with a rapist.

482
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,462
Oh, well,
the night's still young.

483
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,664
You should probably
take that call. Okay.

484
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,269
Holy shit, I cannot
believe this is working.

485
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,069
Who says it's working?

486
00:21:12,071 --> 00:21:13,337
It looks like
it's going great?

487
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:14,338
I have no idea.

488
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,475
Dude, I can't keep this up.
I'm flying blind up here.

489
00:21:17,477 --> 00:21:19,577
You're going to have to
because here she comes.

490
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:20,745
Can I stay?
No, get out of here.

491
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:21,946
You're glowing.
I wanna stay.

492
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:23,080
Get out of here.

493
00:21:24,182 --> 00:21:25,182
Who were those guys?

494
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,984
I have no idea.

495
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:30,154
Um, listen,
it's pretty loud in here.

496
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:33,991
How would feel
about getting that drink
someplace a little quieter?

497
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:36,260
Yeah, sure.
Where were you thinking?

498
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,401
How'd it go?
Holy shit!

499
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,303
We want details.

500
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,370
Did you guys sleep here?

501
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:47,405
Yeah.

502
00:21:47,407 --> 00:21:48,873
Why?
We were too excited.

503
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:49,907
Yeah, we wanted
to hear how it went,

504
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:53,511
and please,
be very specific.

505
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,979
Why did you move
my furniture?

506
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:56,213
Stop stalling!

507
00:21:56,215 --> 00:21:57,915
Okay, I guess
I can look past the fact

508
00:21:57,917 --> 00:21:59,917
that you guys broke
into my house last night

509
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,821
and slept here,
and just say that,
it was awesome.

510
00:22:03,823 --> 00:22:04,922
Yes.

511
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:07,158
I barely had to even say
anything before,

512
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:08,626
you know, she's asking me
back to her place for a drink.

513
00:22:08,628 --> 00:22:09,794
And when we get there
it was like

514
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,630
she couldn't get
the door closed fast enough.

515
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:16,734
<i>I had never been with a woman</i>
<i>who had so much pent up energy.</i>

516
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:18,436
<i>She literally said...</i>

517
00:22:18,438 --> 00:22:20,237
Let me do
all of the work.

518
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:24,208
<i>The only weird thing was</i>
<i>that she insisted that...</i>

519
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,446
The dolphin
stays on the bed.

520
00:22:28,448 --> 00:22:30,147
Wait,
a dolphin?

521
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,148
Like a stuffed animal?

522
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,719
He likes to watch.

523
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:48,766
I like that.

524
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:51,435
It's just weird enough
to be sexy.

525
00:22:51,437 --> 00:22:54,038
I was able to look
past that though
because the sex was--

526
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,740
BOTH: Amazing.

527
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:57,341
Happy birthday, my man.

528
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:58,376
Thank you, guys.

529
00:22:58,378 --> 00:22:59,643
Don't mention it.

530
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:05,783
So what's
the plan for today?

531
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,186
Don't you have work?

532
00:23:09,188 --> 00:23:10,254
Yeah.

533
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,989
Shouldn't you go?

534
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:13,791
What are you
going to do?

535
00:23:13,793 --> 00:23:14,959
I don't know.

536
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,227
I probably should start
looking for a new job.

537
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:17,294
Good, because we lined up
another girl for you.

538
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,196
Yeah, we figured
it went well last night,

539
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,498
because you
didn't come home.

540
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,732
Yes, but--

541
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:22,900
And we also figured
that since you have no job

542
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:24,101
and you have
no girlfriend,

543
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,503
you probably just sit
around here all day

544
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,505
in your underwear thinking
about how miserable you are.

545
00:23:27,507 --> 00:23:30,007
And we're getting
little tired of you acting
miserable all the time.

546
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:32,176
So we got a new girl
for you to fuck.

547
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:34,011
Because we love you.

548
00:23:34,013 --> 00:23:36,614
Last night was really great,
but it was a fluke.

549
00:23:36,616 --> 00:23:37,615
You're a fluke.

550
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:39,617
That's not an insult.

551
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,618
Guys, let's be honest.

552
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,685
I got lucky.

553
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:43,421
Okay, here comes
Captain Miserable again.

554
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:45,289
It's not going to work
every time.

555
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,991
Well, prove that to us.

556
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,826
Just go to work,
and let me enjoy my day.

557
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,928
No. Come on, big boy.
Show us.

558
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,129
Show us it was a fluke.

559
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:53,731
Will you leave me alone
if I'm right?

560
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,734
Yep.

561
00:23:56,736 --> 00:23:58,335
Okay, then.

562
00:23:58,337 --> 00:23:59,136
All right.

563
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:00,805
Saw you
at Culver City Park.

564
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:02,039
You had
the cutest little dog,

565
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,442
and I was sipping coffee
by that big tree.

566
00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:05,643
Did you see me?

567
00:24:05,645 --> 00:24:07,945
Okay, so we know
she likes dogs.

568
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:10,347
We thought you maybe you knew
somebody who had one.

569
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:12,950
I do, but he is
the craziest person I know.

570
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,118
Good. We're taking it.
Where is he?

571
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,854
He's next door.
Let's go.

572
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:17,955
What do you guys
want her for?

573
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,523
Just give us
the fucking dog, Bryce.

574
00:24:19,525 --> 00:24:22,927
No, we're gonna have the dog
for maybe an hour or two.

575
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,028
We'll bring her
right back.

576
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,163
Thing's gotta walk
or something, right?

577
00:24:26,165 --> 00:24:28,365
Okay, hey, whoa.

578
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,867
Slow down, fella.

579
00:24:29,869 --> 00:24:32,970
It's not an it,
it's a Zoe dog.

580
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,973
That's a kind of dog
named Zoe, it's my dog.

581
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,876
Second of all I take
her for three walks a day,

582
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,277
and one of them
is a dinner walk.

583
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:43,581
Well, just tell me
what you guys are doing.

584
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:45,382
Fuck, fine.

585
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,284
We need the dog
so Neal can get laid

586
00:24:47,286 --> 00:24:50,688
by manipulating some girl
we met on the internet.

587
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,490
Huh?

588
00:24:52,492 --> 00:24:53,491
Okay.

589
00:24:53,493 --> 00:24:55,893
Okay, you can have the dog,
but I want in.

590
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:58,195
No, Bryce, you cannot
fucking join them.

591
00:24:58,197 --> 00:25:00,397
Neal's not going to have
a three-way with some dude.

592
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:02,700
Oh, no, no--

593
00:25:02,702 --> 00:25:04,134
No, I don't want that.

594
00:25:04,136 --> 00:25:07,605
I mean, I want you to teach me
how you internet the girls.

595
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:09,807
Well, it doesn't even
really for sure work--

596
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:10,875
You know, what? Sold.

597
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:11,876
What?
Yeah.

598
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:13,310
We'll have her
back soon.
Bye, Zoe.

599
00:25:13,312 --> 00:25:16,914
Oh, sometimes she likes
to pretend she's a horse.

600
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,215
But don't let her
take it too seriously,

601
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,783
I don't want her to think
she is a horse.

602
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:21,218
This is a bad idea.

603
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,229
She said
by the picnic table,

604
00:25:32,231 --> 00:25:34,598
she's not
by the picnic table.

605
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,766
And she's
reading a book.

606
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,235
Does someone waiting
for someone read a book?

607
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,738
Dude, that is the only girl
in this entire park.

608
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,339
That has to be her.

609
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:45,309
Oh, my God, she's
practically begging for it.

610
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,312
George, when was the last time
you and your girlfriend had sex?

611
00:25:48,314 --> 00:25:49,313
What month is it?

612
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:51,849
Stop stalling.
Go talk to her.

613
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:54,151
Okay, I will go,
and you guys will see

614
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:56,954
that last night
was just luck,
and we can go home.

615
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:58,856
Okay.
That'll be fun for us.

616
00:25:58,858 --> 00:26:00,157
To see that.

617
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,534
Giving up?

618
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,670
Excuse me?

619
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:13,837
Giving up.

620
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:15,039
You seem like you were
waiting for someone,

621
00:26:15,041 --> 00:26:16,240
and they don't seem
to be coming,

622
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,576
so I was asking
if you were giving up.

623
00:26:18,578 --> 00:26:21,979
Oh, I'm not, I'm not waiting
for anyone, I'm sorry.

624
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,247
You're not?

625
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,250
I think I'd remember
something like that.

626
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,184
Yeah, yeah.

627
00:26:27,186 --> 00:26:29,353
That's--That's
what I thought. Okay.

628
00:26:29,355 --> 00:26:32,189
I'm just reading,
and enjoying the weather.

629
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,758
Are you
waiting for someone?

630
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,694
Oh, no.
No, I'm not.

631
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:37,828
You sure?

632
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:41,699
Yeah, yeah.
I'm just, you know,
walking my dog.

633
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:42,700
She's a pretty dog.

634
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,401
Yeah, she is, yeah.

635
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,803
I groom her myself.

636
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:47,371
Is that true?

637
00:26:47,373 --> 00:26:48,272
No, it's not.

638
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:50,507
I don't know
why I said that--

639
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,508
why I said that.

640
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,610
You lie a lot?

641
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,914
Anyway, I'm gonna go.

642
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,015
Sorry for
bothering you.

643
00:26:58,017 --> 00:26:59,383
You're not bothering me.

644
00:26:59,385 --> 00:27:02,686
Actually this book
is not as good as I remember.

645
00:27:02,688 --> 00:27:04,088
Oh, <i>Little Women.</i>

646
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:07,324
Oh, well, maybe I'll--
Maybe I'll see you
at the park here again.

647
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:08,525
I walk her here
all of the time.

648
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,527
So...
You do?

649
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:15,399
I come here a lot
and I've never seen you here.

650
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,234
I don't know
why I keep doing that.

651
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:19,937
I don't walk her here
all the time.

652
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,206
You must make me
nervous or something.

653
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,543
Okay, bye.

654
00:27:31,516 --> 00:27:32,349
How'd you fuck it up?

655
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:34,051
She wasn't waiting
for anyone.

656
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,419
She's the only one here.

657
00:27:35,421 --> 00:27:36,854
It has to be her.

658
00:27:36,856 --> 00:27:38,122
There's no
other explanation.

659
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:39,757
How about
last night was a fluke?

660
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,559
Come on,
I'll buy the first round.

661
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:44,962
Oh, you know what sounds
good right now is a mai tai?

662
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:48,866
BARRY: Hi, I drink mai tais,
and I don't sleep
with my girlfriend.

663
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:50,267
Who am I?
I'm you.

664
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:55,239
NEAL: No, he lives
in total squalor,

665
00:27:55,241 --> 00:27:56,974
but the weird thing
is that Bryce is like

666
00:27:56,976 --> 00:27:58,175
really rich.

667
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,843
Neal.

668
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,345
What are you doing home?

669
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,181
He still lives here,
remember?

670
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,749
Shouldn't you
be at work?

671
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:07,384
I quit.

672
00:28:07,386 --> 00:28:08,786
You did, why?

673
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,888
I just didn't want
to go anymore.

674
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,590
because I didn't see
your car out front.

675
00:28:13,592 --> 00:28:15,092
I left it at work.

676
00:28:16,162 --> 00:28:19,897
Just didn't want to
drive it anymore.

677
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,999
Well, I just came
to get my stuff.

678
00:28:22,001 --> 00:28:23,500
Yeah, I figured.

679
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:26,270
Did you find my
<i>Three Men and a Baby?</i>

680
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,471
No.

681
00:28:27,473 --> 00:28:28,706
Do you want to look?

682
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,211
You seem busy.
I mean,
Barry and George are here.

683
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,212
Oh, don't mind us.

684
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,114
Yeah, we'll be
quiet as mice.

685
00:28:37,116 --> 00:28:38,716
Not gonna say anything.
GEORGE: Uh-uh.

686
00:28:38,718 --> 00:28:41,185
Yeah, I think
I'm gonna try again later.

687
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:42,686
All right.
Suit yourself.

688
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:45,622
Oh.

689
00:28:45,624 --> 00:28:46,423
Can I?

690
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:47,424
You can absolutely
take those.

691
00:28:47,426 --> 00:28:48,792
Yeah.
I don't want them.

692
00:28:48,794 --> 00:28:49,927
Take 'em.

693
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,495
Thank you.

694
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,297
Uh, Christine?

695
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,033
Yep.
Maybe, call next time.

696
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:57,234
I will.

697
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,808
Because for me,
my heart is racing right now.

698
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,909
What is with her
and the

699
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,244
<i>Three Men and a Baby</i>
<i>thing?</i>

700
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,513
It's signed
by the entire cast.

701
00:29:09,515 --> 00:29:10,547
Even Gutenberg?

702
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,548
Yep.

703
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,616
Oh.

704
00:29:12,618 --> 00:29:13,717
All right.

705
00:29:13,719 --> 00:29:16,453
Hey, I have an idea.

706
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,663
Giving up?

707
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:28,031
What?

708
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:29,466
I thought you were
waiting for someone,

709
00:29:29,468 --> 00:29:31,268
so I was just asking
if you were giving up.

710
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,436
How would you know that?

711
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:34,271
Well,
not to sound weird,

712
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,373
but I've been here
for a little bit,

713
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:38,142
and I've noticed
you checking your watch,

714
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:39,176
and looking around.

715
00:29:39,178 --> 00:29:40,377
Yeah,
I'm meeting a friend.

716
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,147
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.

717
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,684
Just so you know,
if it was me,

718
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:49,553
I wouldn't have
kept you waiting.

719
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:53,157
Wait.

720
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,961
Was I that obvious?

721
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,164
I'm mean, you're
the prettiest girl
in this bar,

722
00:30:00,166 --> 00:30:01,765
how could
I not notice you.

723
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:05,702
Thank you.

724
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,171
Um, would you--

725
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,772
would you like
to sit down?

726
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:10,174
Yes.

727
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,710
I'm Michelle.

728
00:30:13,712 --> 00:30:16,213
Neal.

729
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:17,714
My place might be
a little bit of a mess.

730
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,016
Oh, I won't hold it
against you.

731
00:30:19,018 --> 00:30:20,784
Oh, thank you.

732
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,019
No, it's really great.

733
00:30:22,021 --> 00:30:23,020
Can I just make
a suggestion though?

734
00:30:23,022 --> 00:30:24,021
Sure.

735
00:30:24,023 --> 00:30:25,422
Can you
do more of this?

736
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,925
You could
tell that I did that?

737
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:29,092
Oh, yeah, I mean,

738
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:30,694
it hits your eyes,
right when you walk in.

739
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,496
Of course, you're
showing it off, you know.

740
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,031
How could you not
be proud of this?

741
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,733
It's just that most people
don't even notice it.

742
00:30:36,735 --> 00:30:38,101
Yeah. Well, those
people are dense.

743
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,102
I mean,
the amount of detail

744
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,537
you put just
into the musculature.

745
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:41,538
Whoa.

746
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,142
Hold that.
Hold that.
Okay.

747
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:48,545
I've always
wanted to do that.

748
00:30:48,547 --> 00:30:49,646
Sure.

749
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,654
Neal, you came back
to the party.

750
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,622
You're a little late.

751
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:00,958
Can Darren come
outside and play?

752
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,959
Do you think
I find that funny?

753
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,828
Okay, you walked out
in the middle of a party

754
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:05,929
that we threw for you.

755
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:08,732
Do you know
how important a night away
from the kids is?

756
00:31:08,734 --> 00:31:11,735
No, you wouldn't know
because you don't have kids,

757
00:31:11,737 --> 00:31:13,270
you don't have
a girlfriend,

758
00:31:13,272 --> 00:31:14,605
you don't have a job--

759
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:16,073
Can I just talk
to Darren please?
I'm not done yet.

760
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:17,074
Apparently you
don't have a car now?

761
00:31:17,076 --> 00:31:18,242
Neal, hey, man.

762
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:19,276
How are you doing?
We missed you.

763
00:31:19,278 --> 00:31:20,611
Where did you go?

764
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:22,246
It's a long story,
I just came over
to apologize.

765
00:31:22,248 --> 00:31:24,848
Well, get in here.
We didn't get a chance
to give you your present.

766
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:26,283
Oh, yeah, we also have
three day old cake.

767
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:27,951
You want some of that?
I would love some.

768
00:31:27,953 --> 00:31:28,952
I would love
some of that cake.

769
00:31:28,954 --> 00:31:30,153
Thank you, sis.

770
00:31:30,155 --> 00:31:32,089
Excuse me.

771
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,357
And before I knew it,
we're doing it

772
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:34,858
on her coffee table.

773
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,093
That is
easily the coolest thing

774
00:31:36,095 --> 00:31:38,161
I have ever heard
in my life.

775
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:39,496
What about
your kid's first word?

776
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:41,198
No.

777
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,399
Does it work every time?

778
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,567
I've only done it
three times,

779
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:46,303
and one time
the girl didn't show up.

780
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,604
I gotta tell Jillian
about this.

781
00:31:47,606 --> 00:31:48,705
No.
Why?

782
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,707
I don't want you talking
to my sister

783
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:51,775
about me having sex.

784
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:54,111
She doesn't talk to you
about me and her having sex?

785
00:31:54,113 --> 00:31:55,479
No, she doesn't.

786
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:56,713
What are you saying
about me, Neal?

787
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,015
He didn't say anything
about you.

788
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,116
I got to try this.

789
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:00,384
Dude.
I'm just kidding.

790
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:03,086
Jillian would turn my balls
into a magic trick.

791
00:32:03,088 --> 00:32:04,121
Did you say
my name, honey?

792
00:32:04,123 --> 00:32:05,122
No.

793
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,123
This is
a really good cake.

794
00:32:06,125 --> 00:32:07,324
Go fuck yourself.

795
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:08,725
Are you gonna let her
talk to me like that?

796
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,627
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's why I love him.

797
00:32:11,997 --> 00:32:14,631
So, there was something
about a present?

798
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,500
Oh, yeah.

799
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:19,836
Thanks.

800
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,538
It's a moleskin,
'cause you are always talking

801
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:24,308
about doing more writing,
so I thought you'd enjoy that.

802
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,642
Wow, this is--

803
00:32:25,644 --> 00:32:27,544
This is actually
really cool. Thanks.

804
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:30,514
Yeah, we figured since you
weren't working right now.

805
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,748
Thanks.

806
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,517
Anyway, I got to go.

807
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,518
Thanks for the cake, sis.

808
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,852
Oh, it was my pleasure.

809
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:37,754
I have an appointment.

810
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:38,655
For sex?

811
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,856
Do you want to,
we have time

812
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:40,657
before the kids come home

813
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:42,125
now that Neal's
leaving.

814
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,028
Oh, uh, yeah, yeah.

815
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,463
Let's do it.

816
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:47,931
Ugh, I'm got to throw up.

817
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,454
The girl from the park.

818
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,811
Hey, thanks for letting me
use your shower.

819
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:35,712
Again with you.

820
00:33:35,714 --> 00:33:37,414
Why are you always
in my dreams?

821
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,415
You tell me, pal.

822
00:33:38,417 --> 00:33:39,983
Well, at least
you're not naked.

823
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,118
And there it is.

824
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,320
Look,
I want you to know

825
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,688
how bad I feel
about the whole--

826
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,390
Just save it.

827
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,327
I don't want
to hear it right now.

828
00:33:50,329 --> 00:33:52,896
Okay, let me
get this straight.

829
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:55,599
You're bummed
because you've been stood up

830
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:57,734
by a girl
that you were going to trick

831
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,536
into thinking that
she'd been stood up?

832
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:00,804
It's not that.

833
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,607
You're thinking about
the girl in the blue shoes

834
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,641
right now, aren't you?

835
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:06,009
It was her
at the beach, right?

836
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:07,310
I don't know.

837
00:34:07,312 --> 00:34:08,512
But it's time
for you to--

838
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,418
God dammit.

839
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,762
( cell phone ringing )

840
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:28,532
What do you want, Barry?

841
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,566
<i>BARRY:</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

842
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,567
I'm at the laundromat.

843
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:31,568
<i>Oh, okay, great.</i>

844
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,270
<i>You're out of underwear.</i>

845
00:34:33,272 --> 00:34:34,471
You're
wearing my underwear?

846
00:34:34,473 --> 00:34:35,472
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

847
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,840
What difference
does it make?

848
00:34:36,842 --> 00:34:38,075
<i>We're bored.</i>

849
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:40,377
<i>Hey, do you mind</i>
<i>if we start a small fire</i>

850
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:41,445
<i>in your apartment?</i>

851
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:43,246
<i>Bryce!</i>
<i>Oh, my God, that's huge.</i>

852
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,281
I got to go.

853
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,949
<i>I said small.</i>

854
00:34:54,692 --> 00:34:55,826
Has the book
gotten any better?

855
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,163
The book.

856
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:01,198
<i>Little Women.</i>

857
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,301
Yes,
I am reading this book.

858
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:08,004
Do you not remember me
from the park?

859
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,272
( cell phone ringing )

860
00:35:09,274 --> 00:35:10,073
You can get that.

861
00:35:10,075 --> 00:35:11,775
'Cause I'm gonna--
I have to.

862
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:15,579
Remember, I was asking if
you were waiting for someone?

863
00:35:15,581 --> 00:35:17,614
I--I had my dog with me.

864
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,382
The one you
groom yourself.

865
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,118
Yes.
The one I groom myself.

866
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,819
Yes, very funny.

867
00:35:22,821 --> 00:35:24,921
Hey, were you
at the beach yesterday?

868
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,523
I think I saw you.

869
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,525
No, I wish.

870
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,227
I was...working.

871
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,896
Oh, well, I guess
I must have
been seeing things.

872
00:35:32,898 --> 00:35:34,131
Unless you have
a twin sister.

873
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:34,931
Do you have
a twin sister?

874
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,233
No, I don't have
a twin sister.

875
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,534
Do you have
any sisters?
No.

876
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,136
Effeminate brothers that
like to dress up like you?

877
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:39,936
No.

878
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:41,037
So you're
an only child?
Wow.

879
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,639
Do you want to see
my tax returns?

880
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,241
I get it, too far.

881
00:35:44,243 --> 00:35:45,642
I don't even know you.

882
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,410
I'm Neal, by the way.

883
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,913
I'm Jane.

884
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:50,847
Are you sure?
Yeah.

885
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,549
Pretty sure
my name is Jane.

886
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,851
Okay, do you mind
if I sit down?

887
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,353
Well, I'm gonna be
leaving.

888
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:57,454
Oh, okay.

889
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:00,157
So, has the book
gotten any better?

890
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,525
Not really.

891
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:02,959
Then why do you
keep reading it?

892
00:36:02,961 --> 00:36:06,329
Well, I have a thing
about finishing things
that I start,

893
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:09,065
which usually means I stay
with them too long, so...

894
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,271
Are you sure you weren't
at the beach yesterday?

895
00:36:14,273 --> 00:36:15,372
Yeah, I'm sure.

896
00:36:15,374 --> 00:36:16,740
I mean, I saw
those blue shoes.

897
00:36:16,742 --> 00:36:18,642
The same blue shoes that
you were wearing at the park.

898
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:19,876
You got a foot fetish?

899
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:20,677
What? No.

900
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,978
I don't even
own blue shoes.

901
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,380
I don't even
like the color.

902
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,481
( alarm buzzing )

903
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,482
Oh,
those are my clothes.

904
00:36:25,484 --> 00:36:27,250
Okay, it was
nice talking to you.

905
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:28,285
Where?
You're leaving?

906
00:36:28,287 --> 00:36:32,088
and I don't usually hang out
in laundromats.

907
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,690
Hey, shopping is done.

908
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,091
You ready to go?
Yes.

909
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:36,092
Ready to go.

910
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:36,893
Jane, if I could just--

911
00:36:36,895 --> 00:36:39,996
Well, well, well,
who is this?

912
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:40,797
This is Neal.

913
00:36:40,799 --> 00:36:42,299
Hello Neal.
I'm Cassandra.

914
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,366
Her roommate.

915
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,602
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

916
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:47,103
How old are you, Neal?

917
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:47,904
32.

918
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:49,105
Did you go to college?
Yep.

919
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:51,975
What'd you study?
Creative writing.

920
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:53,176
You have
a girlfriend, Neal?

921
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,010
No.

922
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,012
When was
your last relationship?

923
00:36:56,014 --> 00:36:57,013
I know it's--

924
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,315
Answer the question.

925
00:36:58,317 --> 00:36:59,382
It ended
three months ago.

926
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,383
Did you dump her?
No.

927
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:01,918
You cheated on her?
She cheated.

928
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,421
You have a job, Neal?
In between.

929
00:37:04,423 --> 00:37:05,722
Times are tough.
Yeah.

930
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:07,123
You exercise?
Try to.

931
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:08,124
Sense of humor?

932
00:37:08,126 --> 00:37:10,126
( imitates horn )

933
00:37:10,128 --> 00:37:11,728
Oh, my God.

934
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:13,530
Where did you
find this guy?

935
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:15,799
He was sticking to
the lint screen.

936
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:17,534
You have to get back
to that, right?

937
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,336
( alarm buzzing )

938
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:20,537
Looks like I'm done.

939
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:21,771
Great, you can come
join us.

940
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:23,707
We were just about to get
an afternoon cocktail.

941
00:37:23,709 --> 00:37:25,108
JANE: Cassandra.
What?

942
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,743
Were we not just
about to go do that?

943
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:29,746
Yeah, but Neal's
practically a stranger,

944
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,448
a very busy stranger.

945
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:33,049
I literally have
nothing to do all day.

946
00:37:33,051 --> 00:37:35,252
Oh, great, then you
can come join us.

947
00:37:35,254 --> 00:37:37,020
We're just going to a place
right around the corner.

948
00:37:37,022 --> 00:37:38,221
Oh, I would
love to come.

949
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,724
Oh, I walked here.
I live just down the block.

950
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:42,359
So that means
we're all neighbors.

951
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:44,127
What?
That is very convenient.

952
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:46,963
You want to throw
your clothes in my cart?

953
00:37:46,965 --> 00:37:49,065
Oh, well, don't mind
if I do, m'lady.

954
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,333
Yeah, he's fun.

955
00:37:50,335 --> 00:37:51,768
Did you hear that?
"He's fun."

956
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,970
Okay, I'm going
to have one drink.

957
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:54,771
Yeah, right.

958
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,573
This girl is a lush.

959
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,341
I am no such thing.
I am--

960
00:37:58,343 --> 00:37:59,976
CASSANDRA:
Probably drunk right now.

961
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:07,884
Oh, right here.

962
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,288
This is
a really cool place.

963
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,692
Nice blue shoes.
Thanks.

964
00:38:15,694 --> 00:38:17,360
Yeah, this lady
has a pair just like them,

965
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:21,998
but they are way too big
for my tiny little feet.

966
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:22,899
Is that right?

967
00:38:22,901 --> 00:38:24,301
Lots of people
have blue shoes, Neal.

968
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,870
Yeah, but how many
who look exactly like you?

969
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,772
Okay, about that drink,

970
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,907
we don't want to
keep Neal all day.

971
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,175
Again, you're not
keeping me from anything.

972
00:38:32,177 --> 00:38:33,410
Well, there
really must be something

973
00:38:33,412 --> 00:38:34,678
that we're
keeping you from.

974
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,380
I have absolutely nowhere
to be but right here.

975
00:38:37,382 --> 00:38:38,815
Yay, that's great.

976
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,083
Yay.

977
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:41,918
So what's your
story, Neal?

978
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,987
Oh, so now you want to know
something about me?

979
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:44,821
Yeah.

980
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:47,424
I mean,
who is Neal?

981
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,525
Let's see.

982
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:51,027
Um, born,

983
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:52,095
grew up,

984
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:52,929
middle class,

985
00:38:52,931 --> 00:38:55,298
college, Los Angeles,
here.

986
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:57,500
I mean, I'm sure there's
some stuff in between,

987
00:38:57,502 --> 00:38:59,336
but I don't
really remember.

988
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:00,537
You?

989
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,771
About the same.

990
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:05,542
Born, grew up, parents
divorce, two Christmases,

991
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:06,943
yay.

992
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:10,914
Uh, college,
Los Angeles, here.

993
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:13,350
Mine just
goes born, here.

994
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:14,417
Two steps?

995
00:39:14,419 --> 00:39:15,618
Yeah.

996
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:17,454
Sounds about right.

997
00:39:17,456 --> 00:39:19,222
So, what
should we drink to?

998
00:39:19,224 --> 00:39:23,460
Here's to a long life
and a merry one.

999
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,061
A quick death
and an easy one.

1000
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:28,965
A pretty girl
and an honest one.

1001
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:31,368
A cold pint
and another one.

1002
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,469
Huzzah.

1003
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:35,238
Yassas l'chaim.

1004
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,674
All right, now
that the pleasantries
are out of the way,

1005
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:38,875
what's next?

1006
00:39:53,991 --> 00:39:59,162

1007

( in accent )
Hello, my name
is Michael Caine.

1016
00:40:23,388 --> 00:40:28,425
Sometimes as an actor,
you will find yourself

1017
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,994
breaking during a scene.

1018
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,328
So, I don't know.

1019
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,430
No, it's really good.

1020
00:40:33,432 --> 00:40:34,431
Yeah.

1021
00:40:34,433 --> 00:40:36,699
Your accent is amazing.

1022
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:38,501
My father
is from London, so...

1023
00:40:38,503 --> 00:40:40,637
My father is from London.

1024
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,338
You don't say.

1025
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:43,540
I have dual-citizenship.

1026
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:44,741
So do I.

1027
00:40:48,245 --> 00:40:49,312
I'm sorry.

1028
00:40:49,314 --> 00:40:50,146
I, uh...

1029
00:40:50,148 --> 00:40:51,347
I don't know
where that came from.

1030
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,117
I'd like to apologize.

1031
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:02,759
It was you
on the beach yesterday.

1032
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,629
No.

1033
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,731
You little liar.

1034
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:09,766
Don't turn it on me.

1035
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:12,335
You're the liar.

1036
00:41:12,337 --> 00:41:14,437
Wait, I'm sorry.

1037
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:16,172
How am I the liar?

1038
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:19,642
Because you've been lying
to women on the internet, Neal.

1039
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:20,910
What?

1040
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,446
You've been responding to
Missed Connections ads.

1041
00:41:23,448 --> 00:41:24,948
What?

1042
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:27,283
Yeah, you've been
lying to women online.

1043
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:29,085
I don't know--I don't know
what you're talking about.

1044
00:41:29,087 --> 00:41:31,554
I was your
"Missed Connection"
on the beach yesterday.

1045
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:32,889
I knew it was you.

1046
00:41:32,891 --> 00:41:34,090
God, why did you run away

1047
00:41:34,092 --> 00:41:35,492
when I was trying
to talk to you yesterday--

1048
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,460
Oh, stop. Just stop.

1049
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:42,499
Because it was
the second fake ad

1050
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,300
that you responded to.

1051
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,002
Fake ad.

1052
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:48,972
Second.

1053
00:41:48,974 --> 00:41:52,208
You were
my "Missed Connection"
at the park too.

1054
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,209
Yep.

1055
00:41:57,214 --> 00:42:00,416
I'm sorry,
why would you post a fake ad?

1056
00:42:00,418 --> 00:42:01,918
What do you
possibly get out that?

1057
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,720
What do you get out
of lying to women?

1058
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:05,054
What do you do
when they realize

1059
00:42:05,056 --> 00:42:07,824
that you are not the guy
that they were hoping to see?

1060
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,526
I don't pretend
to be anything I am not.

1061
00:42:09,528 --> 00:42:10,727
I just sit around

1062
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,395
and, you know, wait.

1063
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:15,331
Wait, you don't pretend
to be the guy.

1064
00:42:15,333 --> 00:42:16,332
No.

1065
00:42:18,235 --> 00:42:20,803
Oh, man.

1066
00:42:20,805 --> 00:42:23,806
Like a knight
in shining armor.

1067
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:24,807
Yeah.

1068
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:26,142
Fuck.

1069
00:42:26,144 --> 00:42:27,343
What?

1070
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:32,415
So wait, you gave a fake
response to my fake ad?

1071
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:35,351
Hoping that you would use
my vulnerability

1072
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:37,820
to sleep with me?

1073
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:41,858
You never answered
my question.

1074
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,259
What do I get out of it?

1075
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:45,061
Yeah.

1076
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:47,363
I think
this conversation is over.

1077
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:54,037
Wait, no, I'm sorry,
I just confided a lot into you,

1078
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:55,338
and I think
I deserve a little bit

1079
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,172
of an explanation.

1080
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:57,173
Shut up.
Shut up.

1081
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,541
So, we're back
to this again.

1082
00:42:58,543 --> 00:43:00,043
Yeah.
Okay, okay.

1083
00:43:05,849 --> 00:43:06,983
I'm having a hard time.

1084
00:43:06,985 --> 00:43:08,585
I feel like
the room is spinning.

1085
00:43:08,587 --> 00:43:09,586
It's definitely spinning.

1086
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:11,054
Hold on.
All right.

1087
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,455
I just wanna...
Yes.

1088
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:14,390
I just need to close
my eyes for a second.

1089
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,592
It's so spinning.

1090
00:43:15,594 --> 00:43:16,659
I'm just gonna
close--

1091
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:18,962
Okay.
All right.

1092
00:43:38,515 --> 00:43:40,316
Fuck.

1093
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,519
Jane?

1094
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,231
No, that's totally fine.

1095
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,940
I should
probably go.

1096
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,314
Morning.
Go fuck yourself.

1097
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:12,548
See, honey,
it's like I always say.

1098
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:13,616
No hesitation.

1099
00:44:24,561 --> 00:44:25,928
Welcome home.

1100
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,364
For fuck's sake,
do you guys not pay
rent somewhere?

1101
00:44:28,366 --> 00:44:30,466
I do, but my place
is kind of a dump.

1102
00:44:30,468 --> 00:44:32,568
Plus, you have cable.

1103
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,871
Oh, my girlfriend's out
of town for the weekend,

1104
00:44:34,873 --> 00:44:36,372
and I don't know
how to be alone anymore.

1105
00:44:36,374 --> 00:44:37,373
So...

1106
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:38,174
Bryce?

1107
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,742
I live next door.

1108
00:44:39,744 --> 00:44:40,877
That's terrific.

1109
00:44:40,879 --> 00:44:42,278
There's a new painting
on the wall

1110
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,379
that wasn't here
when I left.

1111
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:46,749
Yeah, this clown
is in my top five clowns.

1112
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:49,686
Uh, there's a grill
here in the living room.

1113
00:44:49,688 --> 00:44:50,653
It's off now.

1114
00:44:50,655 --> 00:44:52,588
Yeah, but it's
still probably a fire hazard.

1115
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,190
Not anymore.
Anymore?

1116
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,792
Well, when it was on
it was dangerous as hell.

1117
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:57,994
Also, thanks for
all those phone calls

1118
00:44:57,996 --> 00:44:58,995
yesterday afternoon.

1119
00:44:58,997 --> 00:45:00,063
Appreciate that.

1120
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:01,197
Yeah, we
ran out of beer.

1121
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,165
I was gonna see
if you could pick some up.

1122
00:45:02,167 --> 00:45:03,366
Just go get it yourself.

1123
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,367
I did.

1124
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,669
Thank you.

1125
00:45:06,671 --> 00:45:07,704
So where you been?

1126
00:45:07,706 --> 00:45:10,807
I ran into the girl
with the blue shoes.

1127
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:11,808
Really?

1128
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:13,509
I spent
the night with her?

1129
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:14,577
Really?

1130
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:15,778
It was a little of weird.

1131
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,913
Oh, did she get freaky?

1132
00:45:16,915 --> 00:45:18,014
Here we go.

1133
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:19,015
What,
she try to like dress you up

1134
00:45:19,017 --> 00:45:20,817
and like do you
with a strap on?

1135
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:21,884
Or was there a swing?

1136
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,786
Sex swing?
Or video tape?

1137
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:24,987
She wanted to tape it.
Naughty.

1138
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:26,622
Wait, was it
something really specific,

1139
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:28,991
like, oh, you can't breathe
while we're doing it?

1140
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,927
Or did she try
and strap you down

1141
00:45:30,929 --> 00:45:32,195
to an apparatus
of some sort,

1142
00:45:32,197 --> 00:45:33,629
or like, go
second knuckle on you,

1143
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:34,897
or try to bite you
on the dick or--

1144
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:35,932
Are you done?

1145
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:37,433
No, she was a furry.

1146
00:45:37,435 --> 00:45:39,035
She was one of those furries
and you had to like dress up

1147
00:45:39,037 --> 00:45:40,937
in rabbit costumes,
and like there was holes

1148
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:42,605
in the costume you had
to hump through.

1149
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,608
Did she
try to shit on you?

1150
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,442
Are you done?

1151
00:45:46,444 --> 00:45:47,443
Yeah, probably done.
Yeah.

1152
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:48,811
I don't mean
weird sexually.

1153
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:51,848
I just mean, it just
wasn't what I expected.

1154
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:52,849
In a good way
or a bad way?

1155
00:45:52,851 --> 00:45:54,050
It wasn't her house.

1156
00:45:54,052 --> 00:45:56,152
And, now
I'm interested.

1157
00:45:56,154 --> 00:45:58,054
Yeah, so I wake up,
and she's gone

1158
00:45:58,056 --> 00:45:59,956
So I get up
and go to look for her

1159
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,157
and it wasn't
her apartment.

1160
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:03,526
Wait, what do you mean
it wasn't her apartment?

1161
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,228
Say those
last four words again.

1162
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,729
It wasn't her apartment.

1163
00:46:06,731 --> 00:46:08,030
That's what I mean.

1164
00:46:08,032 --> 00:46:09,665
Did you fuck her or not?

1165
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,668
I'm pretty sure we passed out
before we could.

1166
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:15,838
Bryce.

1167
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:18,975
The problem is
the she posted a fake ad.

1168
00:46:18,977 --> 00:46:20,076
Whoa, what?

1169
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:21,477
Say those
last four words again.

1170
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:22,879
Uh, fuck you.

1171
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:24,580
So, so wait a minute.

1172
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:28,284
You posted a fake response
to a fake ad.

1173
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,386
Yeah, but she's
not doing it to get laid.

1174
00:46:30,388 --> 00:46:32,555
In fact, I don't think
she even talks to the guys

1175
00:46:32,557 --> 00:46:33,356
who show up.

1176
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:35,291
That's fucking sick.
I know.

1177
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:36,592
I want to meet this woman.

1178
00:46:36,594 --> 00:46:38,594
Oh, yeah, I could drive.
I'll drive us right now, go.

1179
00:46:38,596 --> 00:46:39,996
You're okay,
you're okay.

1180
00:46:39,998 --> 00:46:41,197
All right.

1181
00:46:41,199 --> 00:46:42,532
So wait a minute,
wait a minute.

1182
00:46:42,534 --> 00:46:44,100
The two people that are lying
about missed connections

1183
00:46:44,102 --> 00:46:45,401
actually met up?

1184
00:46:45,403 --> 00:46:47,870
Well,
that's serendipitous.
I know, right?

1185
00:46:47,872 --> 00:46:49,071
Yeah.
I don't see that.

1186
00:46:49,073 --> 00:46:50,206
No, it is.
Okay.

1187
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:51,274
Okay.
Good.

1188
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:53,009
I mean...
Fine.

1189
00:46:53,011 --> 00:46:54,210
What's happening?
No one knows.

1190
00:46:54,212 --> 00:46:55,611
Yeah.
It's a mystery.

1191
00:46:55,613 --> 00:46:56,813
But seriously...

1192
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:59,415
Are you going to go back
to fucking random women?

1193
00:47:04,888 --> 00:47:06,022
Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1194
00:47:06,024 --> 00:47:07,023
Okay.
Oh, good.

1195
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,257
Yeah.

1196
00:47:08,259 --> 00:47:09,625
Good, because I have
the perfect woman for you.

1197
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:11,227
Have you now?

1198
00:47:11,229 --> 00:47:14,330
I never do this but I saw
a very good looking
tall man today

1199
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:16,999
at the supermarket
on Colorado Blvd.

1200
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,401
If this is you
and you are single

1201
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:22,405
and possibly interested
feel free to e-mail me back.

1202
00:47:22,407 --> 00:47:23,639
I mean,
she is practically begging for
it.

1203
00:47:23,641 --> 00:47:24,440
I'll take her.

1204
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:25,808
No, you're in training.

1205
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:26,943
Hand down.

1206
00:47:26,945 --> 00:47:28,044
Thank you, sir.

1207
00:47:28,046 --> 00:47:29,045
You are
very much welcome.

1208
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:30,246
Oh, why, thank you.
Why, thank you.

1209
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,347
Oh, indeed.
Indeed.

1210
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:32,448
Indeed.
Indeed.

1211
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,016
Okay, okay, okay,
are we done?

1212
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,218
Yeah, that was weird.

1213
00:47:54,671 --> 00:47:55,671
Jane.

1214
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,475
Yes.

1215
00:48:00,377 --> 00:48:01,844
What are you doing here?

1216
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:03,379
It's a seafood
restaurant, Neal.

1217
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,382
I'm eating seafood.

1218
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:08,251
You're my missed connection,
aren't you?

1219
00:48:09,152 --> 00:48:10,786
I'll take that

1220
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,288
as a yes.

1221
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:13,990
So what happened
last night?

1222
00:48:13,992 --> 00:48:14,991
You don't remember?

1223
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:16,592
No, I remember.

1224
00:48:16,594 --> 00:48:17,760
Where were we?

1225
00:48:17,762 --> 00:48:18,794
Whose place was that?

1226
00:48:18,796 --> 00:48:20,796
Oh, I didn't mention
I was housesitting?

1227
00:48:20,798 --> 00:48:21,898
No.

1228
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,899
I'm housesitting.

1229
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,767
Great.

1230
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,202
Why weren't you there
when I woke up?

1231
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:28,170
Oh, I'm sorry,
were you lead to believe

1232
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,505
that one thing
was going to happen,

1233
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:31,173
and then something else
happened?

1234
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:32,675
You know like you do.

1235
00:48:32,677 --> 00:48:35,511
These women expect
to meet a guy and they do.

1236
00:48:35,513 --> 00:48:40,116
They don't expect to just meet
some guy and hook up.

1237
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:41,517
Do you even call them again?

1238
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,886
Not yet.

1239
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:45,121
That's fantastic.

1240
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:46,722
Neal, you seem
like a nice guy,

1241
00:48:46,724 --> 00:48:50,092
but what you're doing
is more than a little douchey.

1242
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:51,594
You're a bad guy now.

1243
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,796
Hmmm?

1244
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:57,433
But I'm not looking to
get rewarded for it.

1245
00:48:57,435 --> 00:48:58,834
CASSANDRA: Hey, Neal.

1246
00:48:58,836 --> 00:49:00,336
You're late.

1247
00:49:00,338 --> 00:49:02,104
I was just saying
what a great time

1248
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:03,239
we had with you
last night.

1249
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:04,640
Yeah, I had a great time
last night too,

1250
00:49:04,642 --> 00:49:06,709
but Jane here thinks
I'm a bad guy.

1251
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:09,445
Okay, you guys need
to leave me out of this.

1252
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,513
All right, I'm done.

1253
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,847
I'm done.
I'm done.

1254
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,451
Sorry, Neal.

1255
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,124
Hey.

1256
00:49:22,126 --> 00:49:23,459
Hey, you're right,
you know.

1257
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,529
He really is a bad guy.

1258
00:49:26,531 --> 00:49:28,164
He's such a bad guy.

1259
00:49:28,166 --> 00:49:29,532
I know.
You should have known

1260
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:34,236
by his thin mustache
and ambiguously
European accent.

1261
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:36,472
His weird obsession
with hairless cats.

1262
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,541
Always detailing
how he's going to kill you

1263
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:39,976
before he
actually kills you.

1264
00:49:39,978 --> 00:49:40,943
I don't understand that.

1265
00:49:40,945 --> 00:49:43,079
Like we're there,
just kill us already.

1266
00:49:43,081 --> 00:49:44,747
I know right?

1267
00:49:44,749 --> 00:49:48,250
So Neal
was your missed connection
again, wasn't he?

1268
00:49:48,252 --> 00:49:49,485
Ah-ha.

1269
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,188
I see, you used a European,
thin mustached,

1270
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,556
cat-lover to trap me
into this.

1271
00:49:53,558 --> 00:49:55,257
Yeah, I'm really
good like that.

1272
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:00,396
Yes, he was
my missed connection again.

1273
00:50:00,398 --> 00:50:02,098
That's pretty serendipitous.

1274
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,766
Not really.

1275
00:50:03,768 --> 00:50:05,501
He lies
to a lot of women.

1276
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:07,003
You lie
to a lot of men.

1277
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,204
It's not the same thing.

1278
00:50:08,206 --> 00:50:11,173
Anyway, you're not supposed
to worry about this.

1279
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,208
Oh, yeah, I know.

1280
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,509
I'm--I'm aware.

1281
00:50:13,511 --> 00:50:14,910
Hey, remember
when I promised you

1282
00:50:14,912 --> 00:50:18,214
that I would not ask
why you were setting up fake ads

1283
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:19,915
and kind of going
bat-shit crazy?

1284
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:22,585
Why are you
setting up those ads
and going bat-shit crazy?

1285
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,120
None of your business.
Can I take a guess?

1286
00:50:24,122 --> 00:50:27,023
I think that you are
doing this to see

1287
00:50:27,025 --> 00:50:31,727
if men are capable
of being hurt like you were.

1288
00:50:32,896 --> 00:50:33,729
Okay, all right.

1289
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,531
So you set up
these like vague ads

1290
00:50:35,533 --> 00:50:38,034
and you sit there
and you watch these men

1291
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:42,505
and you see if they are
able to be hurt or affected

1292
00:50:42,507 --> 00:50:45,808
by this potential new love
that just never shows up.

1293
00:50:45,810 --> 00:50:47,009
Yeah.
I knew it.

1294
00:50:47,011 --> 00:50:49,712
I thought I knew.
I wasn't really sure actually.

1295
00:50:49,714 --> 00:50:51,914
Really? You're some
kind of evil genius.

1296
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:52,848
I am.

1297
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,417
I will never
like cats though.

1298
00:50:54,419 --> 00:50:55,751
Me either.

1299
00:50:55,753 --> 00:50:57,953
Hey, listen.

1300
00:50:57,955 --> 00:50:59,722
Mike was an asshole.

1301
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:00,756
All right?

1302
00:51:00,758 --> 00:51:01,757
He was a liar,

1303
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:05,361
he was unfaithful,
he was stupid.

1304
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:06,629
He had a stupid face.

1305
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,564
He did have a stupid face.

1306
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,566
He never
washed his hands.

1307
00:51:10,568 --> 00:51:12,468
Why?

1308
00:51:12,470 --> 00:51:13,536
You know they never are.

1309
00:51:13,538 --> 00:51:14,770
Who?
What now?

1310
00:51:14,772 --> 00:51:16,272
The guys.

1311
00:51:16,274 --> 00:51:17,339
They're never hurt.

1312
00:51:17,341 --> 00:51:19,742
They just act
like nothing happened.

1313
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,078
I think
you just hurt Neal.

1314
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:24,880
Neal is a bad guy.

1315
00:51:24,882 --> 00:51:26,449
He said he had
a girlfriend that cheated.

1316
00:51:26,451 --> 00:51:29,452
So maybe this is his way
of dealing with it.

1317
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,654
Maybe.

1318
00:51:31,656 --> 00:51:32,655
Aw--

1319
00:51:32,657 --> 00:51:34,090
You are so fucked up.

1320
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:35,458
I know.

1321
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,193
But now
that you know my secret

1322
00:51:37,195 --> 00:51:38,894
I'm going
to have to kill you.

1323
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:39,895
And I'm going
to tell you how.

1324
00:51:39,897 --> 00:51:41,497
Here is how
I'm going to kill you.

1325
00:51:41,499 --> 00:51:42,498
No, don't tell me,
don't tell me.

1326
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,566
I'm going to--

1327
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:44,600
I'm just
gonna shoot you.

1328
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,302
That's what I'm going to do.
No.

1329
00:51:46,304 --> 00:51:47,303
I'm just
gonna shoot you.

1330
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:49,004
I think
I'm gonna shoot you.

1331
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,209
Thank you so much
for letting me in.

1332
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:55,111
I really needed to talk
to someone.
Sure.

1333
00:51:55,113 --> 00:51:57,880
Yeah, I can't go home
right now because--

1334
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:01,217
I told you,
he'd show up here.

1335
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:02,418
What are
you guys doing here?

1336
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,519
Oh, my God,
great question.

1337
00:52:03,521 --> 00:52:04,587
They just showed up.

1338
00:52:04,589 --> 00:52:06,388
This is good cake.

1339
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,191
Can I please just talk
to my brother-in-law
and my sister?

1340
00:52:09,193 --> 00:52:10,259
About what?

1341
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:11,427
Nothing.

1342
00:52:11,429 --> 00:52:12,962
You saw
Jane again, didn't you?

1343
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:13,963
How could you tell?

1344
00:52:13,965 --> 00:52:14,997
Holy fuck balls.

1345
00:52:14,999 --> 00:52:17,633
Is this one
of your internet sex girls?

1346
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,734
Darren?
Oh, come on.

1347
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:19,935
You know I can't hide
anything from her.

1348
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:22,037
She'd kill me.
I'd cut his balls off.

1349
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,407
Did you at least
have sex with her?
No.

1350
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:26,542
Really?
Holy fuck balls.

1351
00:52:26,544 --> 00:52:27,610
Stop saying that.

1352
00:52:27,612 --> 00:52:28,844
Just let it--
just give it a chance.

1353
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:30,746
I can't.
Just let it breathe.

1354
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:33,716
No. She saw me,
she got freaked out,
and she left.

1355
00:52:33,718 --> 00:52:35,518
She has to admit
there's some kind of force

1356
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,319
that's dragging
you two together.

1357
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:39,155
She doesn't.
She just blows it off.

1358
00:52:39,157 --> 00:52:40,156
That's what she said.

1359
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,224
That's great.
Thanks for the sensitivity.

1360
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:43,359
That's what she said.

1361
00:52:43,361 --> 00:52:44,660
Oh, well done, master.

1362
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,861
She definitely said that.

1363
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,264
Okay,
you all have to leave. Okay.

1364
00:52:48,266 --> 00:52:49,832
And then she said
I was a bad guy.

1365
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:50,666
Am I a bad guy?

1366
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:51,967
Absolutley not.
No.

1367
00:52:51,969 --> 00:52:53,169
You're my hero.

1368
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,273
No, you're
not a bad guy.

1369
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,575
I mean, there's
nothing you can do.

1370
00:52:59,577 --> 00:53:01,477
She's clearly got
issues of her own, so.

1371
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:02,912
So I do nothing.

1372
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:04,680
Yes. You wait for her
to reach out to you.

1373
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:05,948
She has
your phone number, right?

1374
00:53:05,950 --> 00:53:06,949
No.

1375
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:08,284
E-mail address?

1376
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:09,852
The fake ones
that Barry set up.

1377
00:53:09,854 --> 00:53:12,655
Yeah, I forgot those passwords
right when I set them up.

1378
00:53:12,657 --> 00:53:15,791
Two words,
plausible deniability.

1379
00:53:15,793 --> 00:53:17,793
He doesn't know
what that means.
I do too.

1380
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:19,695
Okay,
you know what then?

1381
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,763
You're fucked.

1382
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:21,797
That's not
what I want to hear.

1383
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:23,299
Okay, well, here's
something else

1384
00:53:23,301 --> 00:53:24,600
you might not want to hear.

1385
00:53:24,602 --> 00:53:26,202
I think it's time
you get another job, Neal.

1386
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:27,269
Oh, eat me.

1387
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:28,704
Oh...Pass.

1388
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:29,705
All right,
let's not start you two.

1389
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,706
Come on.
He started it.

1390
00:53:30,708 --> 00:53:31,907
You started it.
I started it?

1391
00:53:31,909 --> 00:53:33,209
All right. Okay.
All right.

1392
00:53:33,211 --> 00:53:34,510
Why is everyone
so against employment here?
Okay.

1393
00:53:34,512 --> 00:53:35,611
Guys, come on.
It's America.

1394
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:37,012
Come on.
Get jobs.

1395
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:38,080
( doorbell rings )

1396
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:39,114
Oh, they're early.

1397
00:53:39,116 --> 00:53:41,517
That is Darren's
boss and his wife

1398
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:42,685
and we're having
them over for dinner.

1399
00:53:42,687 --> 00:53:44,119
Yes, we're staying.
No.

1400
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:45,521
Everybody out.
Get--

1401
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:47,022
go. Get out.

1402
00:53:47,024 --> 00:53:47,823
Out, out, out.

1403
00:53:47,825 --> 00:53:49,091
No, no.
Take the back door.

1404
00:53:49,093 --> 00:53:50,226
Take the back door.

1405
00:53:50,228 --> 00:53:51,293
That's what she said.

1406
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:52,895
Get out of my life.

1407
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,431
I'm just gonna go ahead
and bring the cake with me.

1408
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,333
I will bring back
your pretty green plates.

1409
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:58,634
What's good?
Midnight?
Just go. Go.

1410
00:53:58,636 --> 00:53:59,835
Okay, bye, I miss you.

1411
00:53:59,837 --> 00:54:00,636
Bryce!

1412
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:01,704
Oh, my God.

1413
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:04,540
Look, I'm sorry.

1414
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:05,641
Um, eat me?

1415
00:54:05,643 --> 00:54:06,709
I'm your sister.

1416
00:54:06,711 --> 00:54:08,644
It's the best I could do
on short notice.

1417
00:54:08,646 --> 00:54:09,945
It's disgusting.
I'm sorry.

1418
00:54:09,947 --> 00:54:11,614
All right, I'll do
better next time.

1419
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,249
Oh, and
this is my brother-in-law,

1420
00:54:13,251 --> 00:54:15,951
Neal. Neal, I'd like you
to meet Ted and Alicia.

1421
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:23,225
Do you guys
know each other?

1422
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,226
No.

1423
00:54:24,228 --> 00:54:25,127
Yeah.

1424
00:54:25,129 --> 00:54:26,662
Seriously, guys,
what's going on?

1425
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:29,565
We saw him
in his underwear

1426
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,866
in our house.

1427
00:54:32,168 --> 00:54:34,770
Randomly.

1428
00:54:34,772 --> 00:54:36,939
There was a woman
staying at your place.

1429
00:54:36,941 --> 00:54:39,942
Do you by any chance
have her phone number?

1430
00:54:39,944 --> 00:54:40,976
Are you serious?

1431
00:54:40,978 --> 00:54:42,945
No.

1432
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,483
You know what the best cure
is for a bad date?

1433
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:48,784
Nyquil.

1434
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:50,286
Dayquil.

1435
00:54:50,288 --> 00:54:53,289
Just got to get right back up on
that horse.

1436
00:54:53,291 --> 00:54:54,390
Oh, I don't know, guys.

1437
00:54:54,392 --> 00:54:56,659
I mean, I really feel like
this whole Jane thing

1438
00:54:56,661 --> 00:54:58,961
is the universe
telling me to stop doing this.

1439
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:00,162
No.

1440
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:05,768
Look, I have
like nothing interesting
in my life right now,

1441
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,770
but what you've been doing--

1442
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:08,604
What?

1443
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:09,805
I have been
doing it too.

1444
00:55:09,807 --> 00:55:11,507
Yeah, but you have been
having meaningless sex

1445
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:12,775
with women for years.

1446
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:14,677
True.

1447
00:55:14,679 --> 00:55:16,011
( clearing throat )

1448
00:55:16,013 --> 00:55:19,014
Bryce, you did it once,
and it was a disaster.

1449
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,015
Yeah.

1450
00:55:20,017 --> 00:55:21,116
Yeah.

1451
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:22,985
He needs a chaperone.

1452
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:24,119
I think
it's a good idea.

1453
00:55:24,121 --> 00:55:28,490
Look, for Neal to do it,
it makes me feel

1454
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:29,725
like I'm right there
with you.

1455
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:31,627
While I'm having sex?

1456
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:32,928
Yeah.

1457
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:35,931
Okay, I just don't
feel up to it, guys, okay.

1458
00:55:35,933 --> 00:55:38,133
Are you
fucking falling for Jane?

1459
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,704
No, the last thing
I need is another Christine.

1460
00:55:41,706 --> 00:55:44,006
Do you
really believe that?

1461
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,274
I don't know.
I don't know.

1462
00:55:45,276 --> 00:55:46,942
I just--I'm not sure if
I should have anymore sex.

1463
00:55:46,944 --> 00:55:48,911
I think it's
just gonna get me more twisted.

1464
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,145
That's not a bad thing.

1465
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,615
Oh, my God.

1466
00:55:53,617 --> 00:55:55,551
I just don't think
I can do it, Barry.

1467
00:55:55,553 --> 00:55:57,653
So the universe
made you a pussy?

1468
00:55:57,655 --> 00:55:59,054
No, that's not what
I meant.

1469
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,225
Allan.

1470
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:07,229
Hey, Neal.
What's up?

1471
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,163
Oh, what's up?

1472
00:56:08,165 --> 00:56:10,332
You mean,
what's up since I walked in

1473
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,768
on you fucking my girlfriend,
and the two of you then

1474
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,236
consequently moving
in together?

1475
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:16,071
Is that what you mean
by what's up?

1476
00:56:16,073 --> 00:56:17,873
Is that
what you're getting at?

1477
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,675
I just wanted to see
how things were going.

1478
00:56:19,677 --> 00:56:21,377
How are things going?

1479
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:24,279
What an awesome question.

1480
00:56:24,281 --> 00:56:29,051
Let's see, I have quit my job,
I have two to three people

1481
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:30,853
in my apartment
at all times,

1482
00:56:30,855 --> 00:56:32,187
none of whom pay
any sort of rent,

1483
00:56:32,189 --> 00:56:35,457
I have started to feel guilty
for all the random sex

1484
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,559
I've been having
with girls on the internet,

1485
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:44,299
But on that note,
how has fucking
Christine been going?

1486
00:56:44,301 --> 00:56:45,401
Look, man, I'm sorry.

1487
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:46,402
I know you're mad.

1488
00:56:46,404 --> 00:56:47,669
Oh, do you now?

1489
00:56:47,671 --> 00:56:49,304
Oh, what's
giving that away?

1490
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,305
I can come back.

1491
00:56:50,307 --> 00:56:51,106
Oh, no, no, no.

1492
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:52,174
Please don't go.
Please don't go.

1493
00:56:52,176 --> 00:56:53,776
We don't even know
why you're here yet.

1494
00:56:53,778 --> 00:56:55,577
Well, Christine has been
trying to come over

1495
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:57,079
to get the rest of her stuff,
and I wanted--

1496
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,514
Jesus, fuck
with the stuff.

1497
00:56:58,516 --> 00:57:00,816
She is obsessed
with the stuff.

1498
00:57:00,818 --> 00:57:02,785
Let me guess,
"Three Men and a Baby" tape.

1499
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:04,319
It's her favorite movie.

1500
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:06,555
It's that
limited edition copy--

1501
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:07,689
Signed by
Steve Guttenberg.
Signed by Steve Guttenberg.

1502
00:57:07,691 --> 00:57:08,824
Yes.
It's fantastic.
I know.

1503
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:10,125
So she sent you over?

1504
00:57:10,127 --> 00:57:12,027
No, I told her
I wanted to see you.

1505
00:57:12,029 --> 00:57:13,328
I wish I could say
the same to you.

1506
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,531
Come on, man,
we've known each other

1507
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:16,532
since we were eight.

1508
00:57:16,534 --> 00:57:17,599
You don't mean that.

1509
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:18,934
The last time I saw you

1510
00:57:18,936 --> 00:57:21,303
it was a view of your bare
ass fucking my girlfriend.

1511
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:23,238
That fucking haunts me.

1512
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:24,039
God,

1513
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,441
why you
two insisted on doing it

1514
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,009
on the couch is beyond me.

1515
00:57:27,011 --> 00:57:28,644
Well, she said you guys
always did it on the bed,

1516
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,012
so I just didn't want
to overstep my boundaries.

1517
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:31,046
Okay, you should
probably go now.
Thank you.

1518
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:32,147
Can't we just
talk about this, man?

1519
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:34,416
Can't you just
shut the fuck up, Allan?

1520
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,120
You know what, Neal,
you weren't listening to her.

1521
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,455
From what
I saw on your end, there

1522
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:41,156
wasn't a lot of listening
going on either.

1523
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:43,025
You know what, don't talk
to me like you know.

1524
00:57:43,027 --> 00:57:44,626
Just get
the fuck out of here.
Real mature.

1525
00:57:44,628 --> 00:57:47,029
Yeah, whatever. Go shave
your ass, you fucking yeti.

1526
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:51,967
Thanks for the help
there, guys.

1527
00:57:51,969 --> 00:57:53,969
We thought you were doing
pretty good on your own.

1528
00:57:53,971 --> 00:57:57,439
Yeah. Right up
to the shave your ass thing.

1529
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:58,974
Otherwise pretty good.

1530
00:57:58,976 --> 00:58:00,242
I like the ass line.

1531
00:58:00,244 --> 00:58:01,477
Thanks.

1532
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:02,478
So what now?

1533
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,681
Get back on that horse.

1534
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:07,082
Yeah, daddy!

1535
00:58:07,084 --> 00:58:08,684
Yeah. Let's get me
an internet girl too

1536
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:10,486
and then you can be
my chaperone.

1537
00:58:10,488 --> 00:58:11,553
Chaperone!

1538
00:58:11,555 --> 00:58:12,588
Mmm-mmm.

1539
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,655
Absolutely not.

1540
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:15,457
He does
need a chaperones.

1541
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:20,162
And I thought
for some reason,

1542
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:21,763
the guy was going
to meet me here.

1543
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:22,798
It's crazy.

1544
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,199
No, no, it's not.

1545
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:26,001
You have
to take risks sometimes.

1546
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,103
Bottom line is, you came here
to meet someone, and you did.

1547
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:29,771
Oh,
look what you did there.

1548
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,607
I try to bring it
back to myself
as much as possible.

1549
00:58:31,609 --> 00:58:33,208
It doesn't make you
seem conceited at all.

1550
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:35,711
Good, good.
I just wanted to be sure.

1551
00:58:35,713 --> 00:58:36,912
Dude, I don't know

1552
00:58:36,914 --> 00:58:38,981
if my sex stranger
is even here.

1553
00:58:38,983 --> 00:58:40,282
Should I like--
I don't know,

1554
00:58:40,284 --> 00:58:42,718
make an announcement
or something?

1555
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,420
Excuse me,
I'm in the middle
of a conversation right now.

1556
00:58:45,422 --> 00:58:47,289
Fuck off.

1557
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:51,727
I'm sorry,
I'm very confused.

1558
00:58:51,729 --> 00:58:53,729
My drink is red.

1559
00:58:53,731 --> 00:58:54,997
Who was that?

1560
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,533
I have no idea
who the fuck
that person was.

1561
00:58:57,535 --> 00:58:59,301
Probably just
some crazy guy.

1562
00:59:01,404 --> 00:59:03,138
I need another drink.

1563
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,006
Um, actually

1564
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:06,041
it's getting
kind of loud.

1565
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,843
Do you want
to get out of here?

1566
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:10,045
Yes.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1567
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,348
And you're
taller than me.

1568
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:14,950
That never happens.

1569
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,228
You know what,
I see an old friend of mine.

1570
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,863
Do you mind if I go over
and just say hi real quick?

1571
00:59:27,865 --> 00:59:29,131
Okay.

1572
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:30,132
Great.

1573
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:36,471
Jane?

1574
00:59:36,473 --> 00:59:37,539
Not now, Neal.

1575
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:38,974
What are you doing here?

1576
00:59:38,976 --> 00:59:40,542
I'm a bit
busy right now.

1577
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:46,848
Holy fuck.

1578
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:48,383
You do not
want to do this.

1579
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:50,085
You don't see me
stopping you.

1580
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,253
Everything okay, Neal?

1581
00:59:51,255 --> 00:59:54,890
Hi, I'm Jane.
I'm Neal's friend.

1582
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:56,992
Neal was just leaving.

1583
00:59:56,994 --> 00:59:58,260
No, I wasn't.
Everything is fine.

1584
00:59:58,262 --> 00:59:59,761
Jane's
an old friend of mine.

1585
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:00,896
I was just giving her
some advice.

1586
01:00:00,898 --> 01:00:02,064
But I don't need
any advice,

1587
01:00:02,066 --> 01:00:03,799
especially from him.

1588
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:05,067
You do realize
what he's doing--

1589
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:06,768
That's probably
enough. Thank you.

1590
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,403
I don't think
she's gonna come.

1591
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,208
Actually,
she's right here.

1592
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,776
Really?
Yes,
she was just leaving.

1593
01:00:14,778 --> 01:00:16,211
Giving up?

1594
01:00:16,213 --> 01:00:17,279
Nope.

1595
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,414
I'm a little confused
what's going on right now.

1596
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:21,383
Okay, so what
he's doing tonight,

1597
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:23,919
he has done over
and over and over again.

1598
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:24,987
What is she talking about?

1599
01:00:24,989 --> 01:00:27,089
She's lying.
That's what she likes to do.

1600
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,124
She thinks it's impossible
for two people to meet,

1601
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,093
and she wants the whole world
to feel the same way.

1602
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:32,227
Well, that's not it at all.

1603
01:00:32,229 --> 01:00:33,729
Well, then why don't you
enlighten me?

1604
01:00:33,731 --> 01:00:35,230
Wait, is this
your ex-girlfriend?

1605
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:36,832
Oh, fat chance.
No.

1606
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:38,300
Absolutely not.

1607
01:00:40,436 --> 01:00:41,436
Happy?

1608
01:00:41,438 --> 01:00:42,504
Yeah.

1609
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,444
I'm so okay with you using me
to get back at her.

1610
01:00:49,446 --> 01:00:51,546
Nothing bothers you.
Nothing.

1611
01:00:51,548 --> 01:00:55,350
you just seem to move right on
like everything is fine.

1612
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:57,519
Are you talking about me
or all men?

1613
01:00:57,521 --> 01:00:59,321
All men.
What? Even me?

1614
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:01,657
Okay, you know that men
aren't the only ones

1615
01:01:01,659 --> 01:01:02,858
who do horrible things.

1616
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,426
I was hurt
just like you were.

1617
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:05,427
Not just like me.

1618
01:01:05,429 --> 01:01:06,862
Because you were
able to move on

1619
01:01:06,864 --> 01:01:09,264
and start fucking
random women.

1620
01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,065
Excuse me?

1621
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:11,466
I can't let it go.

1622
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:14,469
He hurt me, and moved on
with his new life.

1623
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:16,038
So why don't you
move on with yours?

1624
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,372
Oh, like this?

1625
01:01:17,374 --> 01:01:19,041
Hi.

1626
01:01:19,043 --> 01:01:20,676
No, that's not what I was
getting at--

1627
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,880
I didn't want her
to beat you.

1628
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:26,481
Oh, it's on.

1629
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,357
Oh, blue shoes.

1630
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,995
But don't feel bad, anyone
would have lost to blue shoes.

1631
01:01:39,997 --> 01:01:41,563
How tall are you?

1632
01:01:41,565 --> 01:01:43,498
Um, like two websters.

1633
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,879
We shouldn't
have done that.

1634
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,015
Which part?

1635
01:02:00,017 --> 01:02:01,283
All of it.

1636
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,120
Was I not just
in the same room?

1637
01:02:05,122 --> 01:02:06,722
I thought
that was pretty amazing.

1638
01:02:06,724 --> 01:02:09,224
All the more reason,
we shouldn't have done that.

1639
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:15,731
I get it.

1640
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,201
Good.

1641
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:22,437
You know what?

1642
01:02:22,439 --> 01:02:23,839
No.

1643
01:02:23,841 --> 01:02:25,540
No, I'm sorry, no.

1644
01:02:25,542 --> 01:02:26,908
I like you, okay.

1645
01:02:26,910 --> 01:02:28,643
I said it, I like you.

1646
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:31,346
You really haven't been
that cool to me lately,

1647
01:02:31,348 --> 01:02:32,547
but I can't deny the fact

1648
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:34,549
that we have
some sort of connection.

1649
01:02:34,551 --> 01:02:35,851
It's great.

1650
01:02:35,853 --> 01:02:37,252
It's--it's really great.

1651
01:02:37,254 --> 01:02:40,455
In fact, I can't
get you out of my head.

1652
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:43,024
And I can't deny
that we keep meeting up.

1653
01:02:43,026 --> 01:02:44,826
That means
something to me.

1654
01:02:44,828 --> 01:02:48,330
That means that someone
or something somewhere,

1655
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:49,965
maybe wants us
to be happy.

1656
01:02:49,967 --> 01:02:51,533
Maybe thinks
that we've been trying

1657
01:02:51,535 --> 01:02:54,669
some really fucked up ways
to find happiness,

1658
01:02:54,671 --> 01:02:56,071
but in spite of all that,

1659
01:02:56,073 --> 01:02:58,173
maybe thinks
we deserve to be happy.

1660
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:03,678
Let's face it,
we're damaged goods.

1661
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,280
We're cracked.

1662
01:03:05,282 --> 01:03:06,648
And anyone
in their right minds

1663
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:09,151
would see how fucked up
we are and run away.

1664
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,487
But after all that,
I still like you.

1665
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,658
Any reaction to that?

1666
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:17,793
Anything?

1667
01:03:19,362 --> 01:03:23,098
I can't get
hurt again, Neal.

1668
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:25,200
I don't think I could
pick myself up again.

1669
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:51,593
Sorry.

1670
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:03,839
Holy fuck.

1671
01:04:03,841 --> 01:04:04,639
Jesus.

1672
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:06,641
I thought
she'd never leave.

1673
01:04:06,643 --> 01:04:08,043
Were you guys
in there all night?

1674
01:04:08,045 --> 01:04:09,744
Yeah.
We hid when you came in.

1675
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:11,947
George, are you ever
with your girlfriend?

1676
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14,049
No, that girl hates me.

1677
01:04:14,051 --> 01:04:17,619
Wait, did you guys
hear me having sex?

1678
01:04:17,621 --> 01:04:19,421
This door
is not soundproof.

1679
01:04:19,423 --> 01:04:21,523
Yeah, I know. Is that right?

1680
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:22,958
How did you keep
the dog quiet?

1681
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:26,228
Um, she has a lot
on her mind.

1682
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,929
Uh, well,
there's good news.

1683
01:04:27,931 --> 01:04:28,964
Oh, there's good news?

1684
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:32,033
we found Christine's copy
of "Three Men and a Baby."

1685
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,134
Really?

1686
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:34,269
It's signed by
all three of them.

1687
01:04:34,271 --> 01:04:36,171
Yeah, even Guttenberg.
That's a tough get.

1688
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,672
Not really.

1689
01:04:48,684 --> 01:04:49,684
Neal?

1690
01:04:49,686 --> 01:04:50,886
Hi.

1691
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:53,288
What are you doing here?

1692
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:55,690
Oh, you found it.

1693
01:04:55,692 --> 01:04:59,160
It was buried under a bunch
of stuff in the closet.

1694
01:04:59,162 --> 01:05:02,197
Oh, my God, thank you.

1695
01:05:02,199 --> 01:05:03,798
Did you walk here?

1696
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,800
Yeah.

1697
01:05:05,802 --> 01:05:09,304
No, no, no.
I can't--I can't stay.

1698
01:05:09,306 --> 01:05:11,706
I just wanted to come by
and bring you that,

1699
01:05:11,708 --> 01:05:16,111
and let you know that if you
wanted to come over tomorrow

1700
01:05:16,113 --> 01:05:17,512
and pick up
the rest of your stuff,

1701
01:05:17,514 --> 01:05:19,814
I'd be okay with that.

1702
01:05:19,816 --> 01:05:20,916
Are you feeling okay?

1703
01:05:20,918 --> 01:05:21,917
Yeah.

1704
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,685
Well, no,
not in general,

1705
01:05:23,687 --> 01:05:25,020
but I do know
that I'm okay

1706
01:05:25,022 --> 01:05:26,588
with what
I just said about you

1707
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,923
coming over
to get your stuff.

1708
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,392
So...all right.

1709
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,528
Hey, Neal?

1710
01:05:36,132 --> 01:05:38,233
Did you really
want to marry me?

1711
01:05:38,235 --> 01:05:39,501
I mean,
you bought that ring.

1712
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:42,237
Why--
why didn't you propose?

1713
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,407
I don't know.

1714
01:05:45,409 --> 01:05:46,541
I think maybe I was doing

1715
01:05:46,543 --> 01:05:48,143
what I thought
I was supposed to.

1716
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:50,845
You could have
quit at any time.

1717
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,147
I know.

1718
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:53,548
Now.

1719
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:56,651
Okay, seriously,
what is going on with you?

1720
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:57,819
What?
What do you mean?

1721
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,554
I haven't seen you
this rational

1722
01:05:59,556 --> 01:06:01,523
since we started dating.

1723
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:04,025
The party side
got raped out of me,

1724
01:06:04,027 --> 01:06:06,861
and this is all that's left.

1725
01:06:06,863 --> 01:06:10,031
That's like
one of the weirdest things
I've ever said.

1726
01:06:10,033 --> 01:06:12,634
I don't know why,
that was really weird.
I'm not sure what that means.

1727
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,235
Please, let me--

1728
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:17,572
Christine, I--
I just want you to know that

1729
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:19,341
in spite of everything,

1730
01:06:19,343 --> 01:06:22,077
I do genuinely
want you to be happy.

1731
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,779
I am happy.

1732
01:06:24,781 --> 01:06:26,881
And that's all
I ever wanted for you.

1733
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:30,986
I know.

1734
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,990
Thanks.

1735
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:36,291

Hey, fuck you, man.

1750
01:08:20,297 --> 01:08:21,496
Excuse me?

1751
01:08:21,498 --> 01:08:23,698
I'll handle this. Excuse me?

1752
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,167
It sounded like
you said fuck you.

1753
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:28,169
I did.

1754
01:08:28,171 --> 01:08:30,405
Well done.

1755
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,807
Thank you.

1756
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:33,875
Waiting for someone?

1757
01:08:33,877 --> 01:08:34,909
Yes.

1758
01:08:34,911 --> 01:08:37,412
They're not
coming, are they?

1759
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:38,413
It doesn't seem that way.

1760
01:08:38,415 --> 01:08:40,315
Love.

1761
01:08:40,317 --> 01:08:43,084
It's a sticky business.

1762
01:08:43,086 --> 01:08:44,486
Yes.

1763
01:08:44,488 --> 01:08:47,188
Yes, indeed.

1764
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:50,492
See, honey, you have
to allow a man to respect you.

1765
01:08:50,494 --> 01:08:51,793
I love you, baby.

1766
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,398
Giving up so easy?

1767
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,399
What?

1768
01:08:58,401 --> 01:08:59,701
I asked
if you were giving up.

1769
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:01,136
It seemed like you were
waiting for someone.

1770
01:09:01,138 --> 01:09:03,238
And you wanted to know
if I was giving up.

1771
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:06,241
If it was you, you
wouldn't have made me wait.

1772
01:09:06,243 --> 01:09:08,543
Um,
how did you know that--

1773
01:09:08,545 --> 01:09:10,745
Look, I'm--
I'm really flattered. I am.

1774
01:09:10,747 --> 01:09:13,515
On two levels, one, because
you're hitting on me,

1775
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:15,517
but two, because
you're using my technique,

1776
01:09:15,519 --> 01:09:17,152
which either means
I'm not the only person

1777
01:09:17,154 --> 01:09:20,955
or I 'm just
this amazing trendsetter.

1778
01:09:20,957 --> 01:09:22,457
But either way,
I'm just going to go ahead

1779
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:23,858
and just end
this right here

1780
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,560
because I'm
in a really weird place,

1781
01:09:25,562 --> 01:09:26,661
which in the short term,

1782
01:09:26,663 --> 01:09:28,129
could make
for some really interesting

1783
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:30,031
and bizarre sex,
but in the long term,

1784
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:32,233
is probably just going
to fuck me up more.

1785
01:09:32,235 --> 01:09:36,538
So I'm just gonna say,
good day to you.

1786
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,140
And, uh, shake your hand.

1787
01:09:39,142 --> 01:09:44,279
And take my leave, and yes,
I did just say take my leave.

1788
01:09:44,281 --> 01:09:46,648
So keep on trying.

1789
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:49,751
Oh, and the guy
you want is over there.

1790
01:09:52,888 --> 01:09:53,922
But...

1791
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:11,773
Hello?

1792
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:13,474
Coming.

1793
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:15,109
Good morning.

1794
01:10:15,111 --> 01:10:17,412
Yeah,
we don't believe in Jesus

1795
01:10:17,414 --> 01:10:19,214
if that's what
you're selling.

1796
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,715
No, no.
I, uh,

1797
01:10:20,717 --> 01:10:22,417
responded to an ad
about a couch.

1798
01:10:22,419 --> 01:10:25,420
Oh, oh, well fuck,
yeah, I'm sorry.

1799
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:27,589
Um, oops.
I'm Derek.

1800
01:10:27,591 --> 01:10:28,823
Hi, come on in.

1801
01:10:28,825 --> 01:10:31,092
Sorry, we get a lot of
Jesus pushers around here.

1802
01:10:31,094 --> 01:10:32,093
No, it's all right.

1803
01:10:32,095 --> 01:10:33,428
Yeah, oh, good. Um,

1804
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:35,930
well, uh, you are looking
to redecorate?

1805
01:10:35,932 --> 01:10:37,832
No, I walked in
on my girlfriend

1806
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:40,001
and my best friend
fucking on my old couch.

1807
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:42,837
Oh, well,
that's a good enough reason.

1808
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:44,339
So,
uh, well, this is the couch.

1809
01:10:44,341 --> 01:10:45,673
Okay.

1810
01:10:45,675 --> 01:10:48,009
Oh, and these are my roommates
Jessica and Cassandra.

1811
01:10:48,011 --> 01:10:50,745
Oh, you've got to be
fucking kidding me.

1812
01:10:50,747 --> 01:10:52,847
I'm sorry,
Jessica was it?

1813
01:10:52,849 --> 01:10:56,851
Wow, I could have sworn
your name was Jane.

1814
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:58,519
No, it's actually Jessica.

1815
01:10:58,521 --> 01:11:02,357
That's weird, I knew a Jane
that looks just like you.

1816
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:05,226
It might have been you.
No, it wasn't.

1817
01:11:05,228 --> 01:11:07,562
Okay.
So this is the couch.

1818
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:08,563
It's vintage.

1819
01:11:08,565 --> 01:11:09,831
It's
totally comfortable.

1820
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:11,966
But not like in a suffocating,
like scary way

1821
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:14,469
like I shouldn't be afraid
to go with this couch.

1822
01:11:14,471 --> 01:11:19,340
Um, and it also has all of
it's original upholstery.

1823
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:21,776
So you know what, what you
see is what you get.

1824
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:23,645
There's no surprises,
but at the same time,

1825
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,879
I'm never going
to get bored with this.

1826
01:11:24,881 --> 01:11:27,849
No, it's just
what you are looking for.

1827
01:11:27,851 --> 01:11:30,451
Well, I'm not really looking
for anything in particular.

1828
01:11:30,453 --> 01:11:32,754
Oh, good because I'm the one
buying the couch, not you.

1829
01:11:32,756 --> 01:11:34,188
Okay, so if this couch fits--

1830
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,890
I don't really feel like anyone
should be looking

1831
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:37,191
for anything
in particular.

1832
01:11:37,193 --> 01:11:39,661
Good, because usually
when you are not looking

1833
01:11:39,663 --> 01:11:40,762
is when you find
the best stuff.

1834
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:42,096
Or potential pitfalls.

1835
01:11:42,098 --> 01:11:43,398
Or potential awesome.

1836
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,999
Okay.
Back to task.

1837
01:11:45,001 --> 01:11:46,200
Uh--uh,

1838
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:48,803
but I'm totally
willing to negotiate.

1839
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,104
Oh, as am I.
Okay.

1840
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,006
How do you know
if the couch is worth it?

1841
01:11:52,008 --> 01:11:52,807
Jessica?

1842
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:54,475
What are you
afraid of?

1843
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:55,877
You see a couch.

1844
01:11:55,879 --> 01:11:57,512
You like it.
You sit on it.

1845
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:58,713
You know it feels nice,

1846
01:11:58,715 --> 01:12:00,081
so you want to sit
on it again, right, Derek?

1847
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,816
Sure.
It's a fucking couch.

1848
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:02,817
We're not asking you
to take out

1849
01:12:02,819 --> 01:12:04,686
a car loan or a mortgage.

1850
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:06,988
Neal, just relax.
It's just a couch.

1851
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:08,890
It is a really
great couch.

1852
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,191
Goddamn
right, it is.

1853
01:12:10,193 --> 01:12:13,227
Yeah, but a couch could lead
to a matching love seat

1854
01:12:13,229 --> 01:12:15,430
or an apartment
or a fucking house

1855
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:16,831
with a goddamn
picket fence.

1856
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,933
Or it could lead to this
really great partner in crime.

1857
01:12:18,935 --> 01:12:19,934
Or another
totally devastating--

1858
01:12:19,936 --> 01:12:21,035
What are you afraid of?

1859
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,937
This couch
punching me in the gut.

1860
01:12:22,939 --> 01:12:24,739
This couch
would never do that.

1861
01:12:24,741 --> 01:12:25,740
Okay, we're clearly

1862
01:12:25,742 --> 01:12:27,342
not talking about
the couch anymore.

1863
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:28,343
You don't know that?

1864
01:12:28,345 --> 01:12:29,344
I do know that.

1865
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:30,244
But I don't know that

1866
01:12:30,246 --> 01:12:31,746
and I don't think
that this couch

1867
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:33,848
or any couch
can change my mind.

1868
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:35,850
Well, this couch is not leaving
without a fight.

1869
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:37,151
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.

1870
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,621
Oh, this is the guy?

1871
01:12:40,623 --> 01:12:42,023
Yeah.
Oh.

1872
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,360
BOTH: Awww.

1873
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:55,169
So you're
wearing clothes this time?

1874
01:12:55,171 --> 01:12:58,673
Neal, for the tenth time,
this isn't a dream.

1875
01:12:58,675 --> 01:12:59,674
It isn't?

1876
01:12:59,676 --> 01:13:01,476
No, it is.

1877
01:13:01,478 --> 01:13:03,478
It's a dream.

1878
01:13:03,480 --> 01:13:04,479
Okay.

1879
01:13:04,481 --> 01:13:05,680
Yeah.

1880
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:07,882
So Jessica seems nice.

1881
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,083
Don't even
think about it.

1882
01:13:09,085 --> 01:13:10,184
What?

1883
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:11,886
This is a dream,

1884
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:14,088
and in actuality
every person in a dream

1885
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,891
is like a manifestation
of yourself, so.

1886
01:13:16,893 --> 01:13:18,493
What are you
talking about?

1887
01:13:18,495 --> 01:13:20,161
By me saying
Jessica seems nice,

1888
01:13:20,163 --> 01:13:22,663
it's basically like you saying
Jessica seems nice.

1889
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,701
Oh, well, then,
yeah, she is.

1890
01:13:26,703 --> 01:13:28,369
She's nice.

1891
01:13:28,371 --> 01:13:30,505
She is, isn't she?

1892
01:13:30,507 --> 01:13:31,873
Why are you naked?

1893
01:13:37,212 --> 01:13:38,379
What's wrong?

1894
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:42,817
Nothing.

1895
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:44,118
