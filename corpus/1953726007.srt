1
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,595
My mother made me promise
to be an artist.

2
00:00:38,938 --> 00:00:42,841
She taught me that imagination
could take a person anywhere.

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,102
Mine took me from Indiana...

4
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:48,304
...to Broadway to Hollywood.

5
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:49,982
She was right.

6
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:55,946
- Hello, Lou.
- Mr. Kazan, how are you?

7
00:00:56,157 --> 00:00:59,126
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, sir.

8
00:00:59,427 --> 00:01:02,260
- Otto. How are you?
- Good morning, sir.

9
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:05,955
- Good morning, Mr. Kazan.
- Good morning, Miss Harris.

10
00:01:09,504 --> 00:01:11,734
You look beautiful, Julie.

11
00:01:13,208 --> 00:01:14,505
Thank you.

12
00:01:15,077 --> 00:01:17,477
- Perfect, Anna.
- Thank you, Mr. Kazan.

13
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,714
- Let's film this, Mike.
- Yes, sir.

14
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:22,511
What else do we have?

15
00:01:22,752 --> 00:01:25,585
- Raymond. Where is he?
- Let's clear.

16
00:01:26,089 --> 00:01:29,320
Good morning. Hello!
It's nice to see you again.

17
00:01:29,525 --> 00:01:32,188
Elia, good heavens,
they're shooting.

18
00:01:32,396 --> 00:01:34,626
It's okay.
We're not shooting with sound.

19
00:01:34,832 --> 00:01:37,300
Good. How are you?
Good morning, Anna.

20
00:01:37,501 --> 00:01:39,594
Julie, you look marvelous.

21
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:41,668
Thank you. Good morning, Raymond.

22
00:01:41,905 --> 00:01:43,999
- Good morning, Mr. Massey.
- Good morning.

23
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,336
Good morning. Lovely day.

24
00:01:46,544 --> 00:01:49,741
This is what he'll wear
in the birthday scene.

25
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:51,415
I like the cloth.

26
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,844
Just for you, Raymond.

27
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:56,282
Do you think I'm back playing
Abe Lincoln in this get-up?

28
00:01:56,521 --> 00:01:58,581
Not at all.
It seems right to me.

29
00:01:58,791 --> 00:02:00,656
All right. It feels good.

30
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,021
Thank you.
Let's shoot Mr. Massey next.

31
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:04,423
Can I have one that works?

32
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,589
Absolutely. We'll get Props on that.
Props, Mr. Massey needs you!

33
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,827
I am so looking
forward to this.

34
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,098
- So am I, Raymond. So am I.
- Good.

35
00:02:14,308 --> 00:02:17,368
- Do you want this smiling or natural?
- Natural.

36
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:19,943
I wanted to call you last night.

37
00:02:20,147 --> 00:02:23,948
I wanted to tell you how wonderful
you were in rehearsals.

38
00:02:24,152 --> 00:02:26,416
Just so beautifully...
Just very pleased.

39
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:31,251
- I think we've broken through.
- Oh, yes. I do too.

40
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:33,059
James Dean is here.

41
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,127
Send him in.

42
00:02:35,331 --> 00:02:36,958
Be right back.

43
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:39,665
Raymond, let's stop this for a moment.

44
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:41,560
Sorry, everybody.

45
00:02:42,338 --> 00:02:45,865
The boy I've cast as Cal is coming in
and I'd like you to meet him.

46
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:47,805
Well, I'd be happy to.

47
00:02:48,178 --> 00:02:50,339
He's never done a feature before.

48
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:55,176
He's done some first-rate stage
and TV work. He's a natural.

49
00:02:55,785 --> 00:02:59,313
He may strike you as odd,
but he's enormously talented.

50
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,581
Well, let's take a look.

51
00:03:02,493 --> 00:03:03,824
Jimmy.

52
00:03:04,428 --> 00:03:06,794
Jimmy, come meet Raymond Massey.

53
00:03:06,997 --> 00:03:10,023
- Oh, he's probably shy.
- Come on.

54
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:11,932
All right.

55
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,012
This man can't play my father.
He's too old.

56
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:27,946
Get somebody else.

57
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:37,225
- I'll talk to him. I'll talk to him.
- What-

58
00:03:48,308 --> 00:03:50,004
What the hell
were you thinking in there?

59
00:03:51,012 --> 00:03:55,472
Raymond Massey is a highly respected
actor and you've offended him.

60
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:59,718
- He said I offended him?
- Of course you deeply offended him.

61
00:04:00,155 --> 00:04:01,315
Good.

62
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:04,481
Why good?

63
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,226
Because I need him to hate me.

64
00:04:23,613 --> 00:04:26,013
Yeah, we're still a little hot.

65
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,084
Mark, you up there?

66
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:10,457
Hey, Al!

67
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,732
Al, pan that lamp around.

68
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,861
All right, who isn't ready?

69
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:42,762
Good. Let's shoot this one.

70
00:05:42,966 --> 00:05:46,458
Okay, we're going, people.
Let's all settle down.

71
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:50,073
- And... roll camera.
- Rolling.

72
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:53,300
Scene 163 Apple, take three.

73
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,502
Okay, marker!

74
00:05:58,283 --> 00:05:59,443
And action!

75
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:04,278
Cal, you'll have to give it back.

76
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:10,193
No, I- I made it for you, Dad.

77
00:06:10,396 --> 00:06:11,556
You'll have to give it back.

78
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:15,991
- To who? I can't give it back-
- To the people you got it from.

79
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:17,992
The British Purchasing Agency?

80
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:19,500
I can't give it back to them.

81
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:21,298
Then to the farmers you robbed.

82
00:06:21,508 --> 00:06:24,636
We didn't rob anybody, Dad.
We paid two cents a pound...

83
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:27,870
- Two cents over market for that stuff.
- Cal.

84
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,748
I sign my name...

85
00:06:32,218 --> 00:06:35,120
...and boys go out
and some of them die.

86
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:38,019
And some live helpless
without arms or legs.

87
00:06:38,225 --> 00:06:41,194
Not one will come back untorn.

88
00:06:41,395 --> 00:06:44,023
Do you think I could take
a profit from that?

89
00:06:45,901 --> 00:06:49,064
I don't want the money, Cal.
I couldn't take it!

90
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,134
But thank you for the thought.

91
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:54,969
I'll keep it for you.
I'll wrap it up and-

92
00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:58,341
I can't take it! I won't take it!

93
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,005
Son...

94
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:04,752
...I'd be happy if
you gave me something...

95
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,216
Well, something like your brother.

96
00:07:07,423 --> 00:07:09,391
Something honest and...

97
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:11,451
...and human and good.

98
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,325
Now, don't be angry, son.

99
00:07:14,531 --> 00:07:17,932
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

100
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:20,761
That's something I can value.

101
00:07:24,743 --> 00:07:26,370
No, Cal.

102
00:07:34,552 --> 00:07:36,714
No. Damn it!

103
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,280
I'm sorry, IKaz. I'm...

104
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:40,789
Cut it!

105
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:44,786
IKaz, may I speak to you
a moment? Privately!

106
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,658
Let's not everybody fall apart.

107
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:49,061
- What's up?
- Why is he trying to hug me?

108
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:53,899
It's infuriating! What he's supposed
to do is turn from me and exit.

109
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,768
That is what-

110
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,137
The last moment is mine.

111
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:01,371
- I understand.
- He's humiliating my character.

112
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:05,279
- I'll talk to him and take care of it.
- Please do.

113
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:13,219
He'll be fine.
He's right where we want him.

114
00:08:13,429 --> 00:08:16,057
But I need one more.
You got another one in you?

115
00:08:16,265 --> 00:08:18,927
You just let me know
when you're ready, okay?

116
00:08:19,134 --> 00:08:21,932
This time, try to kiss him.

117
00:08:25,307 --> 00:08:26,502
Raymond.

118
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:35,678
- I've talked to him. He's very sorry.
- I should think.

119
00:08:35,885 --> 00:08:38,912
I don't know what to do either.
I need your help.

120
00:08:39,123 --> 00:08:40,784
- If you could do me one favor...
- What?

121
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:45,018
If you could stay in the scene
and react in character.

122
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:47,697
No matter what he does, wait
for me to yell, "Cut. "

123
00:08:47,898 --> 00:08:49,923
You have no idea how difficult it is.

124
00:08:50,134 --> 00:08:52,103
- He's so unprofessional.
- He's a young man.

125
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:55,501
- Yes, he is.
- You're a brilliant actor. Help him.

126
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:58,938
Help him. Help me because
I don't know what else to do.

127
00:08:59,144 --> 00:09:00,577
All right, all right, all right.

128
00:09:00,979 --> 00:09:05,314
Thank you. Everybody, let's take it
from Adam's line "I sign my name"...

129
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:08,487
...right through Cal's exit
and no stops, no matter what!

130
00:09:08,688 --> 00:09:11,156
Okay, everyone,
back to one, back to one!

131
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:14,986
- "I sign my name" right to the end.
- All right.

132
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:31,435
- Let's go. Quickly.
- Roll camera.

133
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,944
Scene 163 Apple, take four.

134
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,941
- Slate it.
- Marker!

135
00:09:41,223 --> 00:09:42,212
And action.

136
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:45,993
Cal, I sign my name...

137
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:48,925
...and boys go out and some die.

138
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,691
And some live helpless
without arms or legs.

139
00:09:51,901 --> 00:09:56,498
Not one will come back untorn. Do you
think I could take a profit from that?

140
00:09:56,706 --> 00:10:00,437
I don't want the money, Cal!
I couldn't take it!

141
00:10:00,877 --> 00:10:02,708
Well, thank you for the thought.

142
00:10:02,913 --> 00:10:04,710
I'll keep it.
I'll wrap it up-

143
00:10:04,915 --> 00:10:07,111
I'll never take it!

144
00:10:08,219 --> 00:10:09,447
Son...

145
00:10:10,922 --> 00:10:14,050
...I'd be happy
if you'd given me something...

146
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,891
...like your brother's given me.

147
00:10:17,094 --> 00:10:19,120
Something honest and human and good.

148
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,765
Oh, don't be angry, son.

149
00:10:23,168 --> 00:10:26,569
If you want to give me a present,
give me a good life.

150
00:10:26,772 --> 00:10:28,967
That's something I could value.

151
00:10:43,256 --> 00:10:44,349
Cal.

152
00:10:45,693 --> 00:10:47,126
Cal, I-

153
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:54,965
Cal!

154
00:11:05,614 --> 00:11:06,774
Cut!

155
00:11:07,215 --> 00:11:09,207
Print that one, please.

156
00:11:09,819 --> 00:11:11,719
Gets no better than that.

157
00:11:13,222 --> 00:11:14,519
Did you see that?

158
00:11:14,724 --> 00:11:18,285
I did. It was brilliant.
Thank you, Raymond.

159
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:23,530
Okay, that's it.
Let's print three and four.

160
00:11:47,893 --> 00:11:51,124
"O the raggedy man
He works for Pa

161
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,696
And he's the goodest man you ever saw

162
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,764
He comes to our house every day

163
00:11:57,569 --> 00:11:59,435
Waters the horses and feeds them hay

164
00:12:00,073 --> 00:12:03,042
And he opens the shed
And we just all laugh

165
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:06,542
When he just drives out
Our little wobbly calf"

166
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,445
What is he saying?

167
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:11,949
It's a poem, Daddy.

168
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:14,751
He's memorized three entire verses...

169
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,685
...of James Whitcomb Riley's
"Raggedy Man. "

170
00:12:17,124 --> 00:12:19,456
I am trying to read my paper.

171
00:12:21,896 --> 00:12:23,831
It's a lovely poem, Win.

172
00:12:24,032 --> 00:12:27,024
Fine, you two take the front room.

173
00:12:34,743 --> 00:12:36,336
It's not you, honey.

174
00:12:36,546 --> 00:12:39,913
Daddy's upset with me.
Now, he loves you.

175
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:43,381
Come on, come here.
It's not your fault, Jimmy.

176
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:49,389
- It was a long time ago.
- I need a place by myself.

177
00:12:49,593 --> 00:12:51,720
- But I'll be lonely.
- A place where I'm being respected.

178
00:12:51,929 --> 00:12:55,387
Please don't leave me, Win. Please!

179
00:13:19,792 --> 00:13:21,589
You asleep, Jimmy?

180
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,254
No.

181
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:29,459
- Jimmy, I have to go away for a while.
- Where, Mama?

182
00:13:29,703 --> 00:13:31,762
I have to go to the hospital.

183
00:13:37,844 --> 00:13:38,833
Why?

184
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,213
Because I'm not well.

185
00:13:43,284 --> 00:13:45,718
The doctors, they need to...

186
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:52,988
They need to do some things
to make me get better.

187
00:13:54,129 --> 00:13:55,391
Can I go with you?

188
00:13:55,697 --> 00:13:57,790
I wish you could.

189
00:13:58,801 --> 00:14:02,134
Who's gonna get me up for school?
Who's staying with me?

190
00:14:02,337 --> 00:14:03,326
Daddy.

191
00:14:07,811 --> 00:14:09,540
Daddy doesn't like me anymore.

192
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:13,011
No, of course he does.
He loves you.

193
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:14,874
He won't hug me.

194
00:14:15,552 --> 00:14:19,580
Listen, Daddy's not mad at you, Jimmy.

195
00:14:20,324 --> 00:14:24,761
Just keep showing Daddy
your love and he'll love you back.

196
00:14:27,498 --> 00:14:29,990
It's not Daddy's fault, Jimmy.

197
00:14:34,439 --> 00:14:36,407
Now go to sleep.

198
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,440
I love you.

199
00:15:25,327 --> 00:15:28,228
I was nine years old
when my mother died.

200
00:15:28,564 --> 00:15:30,555
My grandmother Emma
came out to Los Angeles...

201
00:15:30,766 --> 00:15:34,100
...to bring my mother's body
back to Indiana for the funeral.

202
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:36,795
I think it would be better
if you came with us now-

203
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,168
I can't do that, Mother.

204
00:15:39,743 --> 00:15:41,973
- The boy is so upset.
- I can't leave work just now.

205
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:44,272
I really can't.
I'll be there at the funeral.

206
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:46,245
All aboard!

207
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:56,186
Take good care of your grandma, Jim.

208
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:01,623
Winton, you shouldn't
take this out on the boy.

209
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,767
Now, for God's sake, give him a kiss.

210
00:16:04,436 --> 00:16:07,428
Say something encouraging.

211
00:16:13,213 --> 00:16:16,341
I'll be coming out to Indiana
in a couple of days, Jim.

212
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,721
All aboard!

213
00:16:36,304 --> 00:16:37,396
You gotta go, Jim.

214
00:16:48,718 --> 00:16:50,583
All aboard, please.

215
00:17:20,918 --> 00:17:22,044
Jimmy?

216
00:17:23,021 --> 00:17:24,045
Jimmy.

217
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:28,892
No, thanks, Grandma.
I'll go sit with her.

218
00:17:53,954 --> 00:17:55,512
I'm right here with you...

219
00:17:55,723 --> 00:17:58,920
...so don't worry about nothing, okay?

220
00:17:59,126 --> 00:18:03,757
Can you hear me?
Mama, can you hear me?

221
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:14,299
My father never came
to my mother's funeral.

222
00:18:14,509 --> 00:18:17,343
In fact, he never came
to Indiana at all.

223
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:20,978
I moved in with my Aunt Hortense
and Uncle Marcus.

224
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,117
Son, you can't stay here.

225
00:19:05,532 --> 00:19:07,466
You almost got me
that time, Mr. Walther.

226
00:19:08,034 --> 00:19:10,468
Yeah, one of these days, James.

227
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:13,871
You got anything for me from California?

228
00:19:15,242 --> 00:19:17,176
No, just the usual.

229
00:19:17,712 --> 00:19:19,976
Want ads, circulars.

230
00:19:20,848 --> 00:19:21,837
I'm sorry.

231
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:24,009
Yeah.

232
00:19:34,663 --> 00:19:38,463
Our next graduate holds
the Grant County record...

233
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,498
...for the pole vault.

234
00:19:40,702 --> 00:19:43,001
He is a four-letter man...

235
00:19:44,007 --> 00:19:46,498
...an outstanding dramatic speaker...

236
00:19:46,709 --> 00:19:51,009
...and as everybody knows,
a fine actor.

237
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:06,022
And he will soon be off
to study Business Administration...

238
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:11,266
...at Santa Monica
Community College in California.

239
00:20:11,736 --> 00:20:15,365
James Byron Dean!

240
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,155
Jim, is that you?

241
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,862
Come on in.

242
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,834
Thank you for letting me
stay here with you.

243
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,842
You can stay here
a month or so, till you're on your feet.

244
00:21:24,048 --> 00:21:25,948
It's fine with us.

245
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:27,810
This is Ethel.

246
00:21:28,452 --> 00:21:29,510
Oh, hi.

247
00:21:30,054 --> 00:21:33,751
Your dad's told me so much about
you. I'm glad to meet you.

248
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,894
Ethel's my wife, Jim. We're married.

249
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:40,664
You're married.

250
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,730
That- That's great.

251
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,469
Let me show you the guest room.

252
00:21:47,673 --> 00:21:48,902
I mean, your room.

253
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,914
I hated business school.

254
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,488
Felt like I was wasting my time.

255
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:12,696
I'd done some acting in high school
and I loved it.

256
00:22:13,602 --> 00:22:17,129
And more than anything,
I wanted to study acting.

257
00:22:17,339 --> 00:22:20,172
Oh, Winnie. Oh, Winnie.

258
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:52,334
Acting?

259
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,568
Like in plays and movies?

260
00:22:57,382 --> 00:22:58,644
Yes, sir.

261
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:07,282
How you planning on making a living?

262
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:10,056
Acting.

263
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,335
You are a dreamer.
Just like your mama.

264
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,768
That wasn't our understanding.

265
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,803
You stay in business school...

266
00:23:27,947 --> 00:23:29,677
...and you can stay here.

267
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:33,686
But you study acting...

268
00:23:37,425 --> 00:23:39,416
...you're on your own.

269
00:23:41,096 --> 00:23:43,155
Next in is...

270
00:23:43,365 --> 00:23:47,825
...Byron and/or James Dean?

271
00:23:48,036 --> 00:23:49,025
Over here, kid.

272
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:54,666
Which is your real name?
Byron or James?

273
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:56,438
Well...

274
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,805
What do you think is better
for an actor?

275
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:03,110
Go with your real name. Less confusing.

276
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:06,015
What can I do for you?

277
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:09,516
I want to study here...

278
00:24:09,793 --> 00:24:13,058
...in your professional acting class,
Mr. Whitmore.

279
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,665
Are you any good?

280
00:24:19,003 --> 00:24:23,167
Well, I did a couple plays
in high school...

281
00:24:23,908 --> 00:24:26,138
...and people said
I was pretty good, but I...

282
00:24:26,711 --> 00:24:29,942
Sir, I don't want to be just good.

283
00:24:30,148 --> 00:24:31,707
I want to be great.

284
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,251
Got any money?

285
00:24:38,324 --> 00:24:39,518
No.

286
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:41,419
I sure don't.

287
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,826
Great ones never do.

288
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:46,362
All right, kid. You're in.

289
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:11,717
It's 12 a week, man. Cash, no checks.

290
00:25:22,405 --> 00:25:23,599
I'll take it.

291
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:30,935
So how come you got a card
up at Whitmore's studio?

292
00:25:31,147 --> 00:25:32,614
You an actor?

293
00:25:34,151 --> 00:25:36,984
Next to Brando,
I'm the world's greatest actor.

294
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:39,289
Who's Brando?

295
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:41,714
Jimmy, Billy, up front.

296
00:25:41,926 --> 00:25:44,759
Billy owns a watch repair shop.

297
00:25:44,962 --> 00:25:47,693
Jimmy's picking up a watch
that he cleaned.

298
00:25:47,899 --> 00:25:50,060
Billy, come here. Come here.

299
00:25:53,004 --> 00:25:56,440
You know it's stolen,
you called the cops.

300
00:25:57,409 --> 00:26:01,346
You gotta keep Jimmy here till they
arrive so you can collect the reward.

301
00:26:01,681 --> 00:26:04,172
Don't let him go. Okay?

302
00:26:09,755 --> 00:26:10,813
All right.

303
00:26:11,525 --> 00:26:14,153
You have an appointment
in 15 minutes...

304
00:26:14,862 --> 00:26:17,490
...to deliver this watch
across town to a buyer...

305
00:26:17,698 --> 00:26:19,757
...for $2000 cash.

306
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:24,166
You want to get the watch fast.
You need the money, Jimmy.

307
00:26:24,772 --> 00:26:27,536
- All right. You both got the setup?
- Yeah.

308
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:34,473
Whenever you're ready.

309
00:26:41,023 --> 00:26:42,513
Hi.

310
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:46,451
I'm here to pick up that watch
right there in the case.

311
00:26:47,162 --> 00:26:49,563
It's not ready yet.
Just give me a minute.

312
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,292
No, that's fine.

313
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:52,967
No, no, no. Stay cool.

314
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:54,227
Give me the watch, man!

315
00:26:54,471 --> 00:26:55,938
Okay, give me a minute.

316
00:26:56,139 --> 00:26:57,401
Hey!

317
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:04,373
- Hey! IKnock it off!
- Come on, you stinking black!

318
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,879
Jimmy, knock it off!

319
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,415
- IKnock it off, Jimmy!
- I'm gonna kill you!

320
00:27:08,686 --> 00:27:11,484
Jimmy, knock it off. Jimmy!

321
00:27:12,189 --> 00:27:15,318
Hey. Enough, enough.

322
00:27:16,495 --> 00:27:17,655
Enough.

323
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:31,732
Stanislavski, you're next. Come on in.

324
00:27:42,957 --> 00:27:44,925
You get into a lot of fights?

325
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:47,093
No, not a lot.

326
00:27:47,461 --> 00:27:48,450
You will...

327
00:27:48,862 --> 00:27:52,026
...if you let yourself go
over the edge like you just did.

328
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:55,334
Jimmy, acting is acting.

329
00:27:55,537 --> 00:27:59,439
You can't get confused.
You gotta know where to draw the line.

330
00:28:01,576 --> 00:28:04,910
Yeah, I know. I know.

331
00:28:06,315 --> 00:28:07,873
I mean, it was good, right?

332
00:28:09,552 --> 00:28:10,951
Yeah, yeah.

333
00:28:11,654 --> 00:28:13,087
Yes, it was good.

334
00:28:13,289 --> 00:28:15,052
Wait, Mr. Whitmore.

335
00:28:15,725 --> 00:28:17,717
I want to ask you something.

336
00:28:21,298 --> 00:28:23,823
Do you think I got the goods
to be a real actor?

337
00:28:27,337 --> 00:28:28,964
Yes, I do, Jimmy.

338
00:28:30,641 --> 00:28:32,472
Yes, I do.

339
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,576
I decided to move to New York.

340
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:43,411
Every actor I cared about,
Brando, Clift, even Whitmore...

341
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,783
...all worked in New York.

342
00:28:45,991 --> 00:28:48,391
New York was big and lonely...

343
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:50,118
...and I loved it.

344
00:28:50,362 --> 00:28:54,389
Being a struggling actor in New York
in the 1950s was the best.

345
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,296
The right place at the right time.

346
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:00,796
I stopped worrying about
my mother and father for a while.

347
00:29:01,174 --> 00:29:02,903
I was dead broke.

348
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,838
It didn't matter.

349
00:29:05,145 --> 00:29:06,669
I was home.

350
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:11,181
Off the stage! Off the stage!
Let's go!

351
00:29:11,385 --> 00:29:15,981
Next five numbers. 120 through 124.

352
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:17,784
Shut up!

353
00:29:17,992 --> 00:29:20,461
Shut up! I want to see those numbers!

354
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:22,458
I want to see them today!

355
00:29:22,697 --> 00:29:26,258
123, 120, 124!

356
00:29:26,468 --> 00:29:30,063
Today, today! Thank you.

357
00:29:33,743 --> 00:29:34,937
Smoke?

358
00:29:35,144 --> 00:29:36,202
Yeah.

359
00:29:37,246 --> 00:29:39,578
- Thanks, man.
- No problem.

360
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:42,148
What's your name?

361
00:29:42,351 --> 00:29:44,148
I can't decide.

362
00:29:44,487 --> 00:29:46,388
What are your choices?

363
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:49,923
Well, I got James Dean, Jimmy Dean...

364
00:29:50,494 --> 00:29:52,359
...or Byron Dean.

365
00:29:52,563 --> 00:29:54,360
Which one's your real name?

366
00:29:54,565 --> 00:29:57,364
James. Byron's my middle name.

367
00:29:58,036 --> 00:29:59,970
Go with your real name.

368
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:03,272
- You think?
- I know.

369
00:30:03,475 --> 00:30:07,206
Jimmy's an 8-year-old boy
and Byron's a dead poet with a clubfoot.

370
00:30:08,446 --> 00:30:10,381
And James is king.

371
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,539
What's your name?

372
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:13,843
Martin Landau.

373
00:30:17,089 --> 00:30:18,249
Where you from?

374
00:30:18,457 --> 00:30:20,618
Why? You wanna come home
and meet my mom?

375
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,054
Yeah, can she cook?

376
00:30:22,261 --> 00:30:24,924
- You like matzo ball soup?
- My favorite.

377
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:28,065
You're invited.
Where you living?

378
00:30:28,268 --> 00:30:30,862
Some dirt-hole rented room.

379
00:30:31,071 --> 00:30:32,129
Let's go, fellas.

380
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:36,969
125 through 129, you're up!

381
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:38,505
What number you got?

382
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:40,510
231.

383
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:41,875
I'm 216.

384
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,180
Let's cut out, man.
Cattle calls are for losers.

385
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:46,353
Yeah?

386
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,955
Unless you got an agent sending you in,
you're kidding yourself.

387
00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:50,318
All right.

388
00:31:00,837 --> 00:31:01,997
Thanks.

389
00:31:03,306 --> 00:31:04,432
You got an agent?

390
00:31:04,641 --> 00:31:06,268
If I had an agent...

391
00:31:08,077 --> 00:31:11,274
...would I be blowing my time
with a goof like you?

392
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:12,975
Come on.

393
00:31:13,184 --> 00:31:16,244
Hey, who was Brando's agent
in New York?

394
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:18,283
Louis.

395
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:19,556
What?

396
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:23,454
I'll take him on.
I have a hunch I can sell him.

397
00:31:23,661 --> 00:31:26,324
To who? To The Ringling Brothers?

398
00:31:26,531 --> 00:31:28,761
Jane, he's too strange!

399
00:31:28,967 --> 00:31:32,266
It's a "strange" people
won't get out of their minds.

400
00:31:32,470 --> 00:31:36,998
I think he's a star.
Let me see what I can do with him.

401
00:31:39,345 --> 00:31:43,042
All right. You do it on your own time,
not on my time.

402
00:31:44,283 --> 00:31:46,217
What am I gonna do with you?

403
00:31:58,498 --> 00:31:59,590
Bring your chair over.

404
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,337
You put "Leads only. "
You can't just audition for leads.

405
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:14,140
Why not?

406
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:17,177
For one thing, you've got to eat.

407
00:32:17,987 --> 00:32:19,921
No, Miss Deacy...

408
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:25,052
Look, I only want to audition
for important parts.

409
00:32:25,494 --> 00:32:28,191
I mean, parts that I care about.

410
00:32:28,765 --> 00:32:30,756
Even if I have to starve.

411
00:32:36,172 --> 00:32:37,434
Fine.

412
00:32:40,578 --> 00:32:42,341
Thank you, Miss Deacy.

413
00:32:44,949 --> 00:32:46,177
I'm a...

414
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:49,344
I'm a really lucky guy.

415
00:32:50,588 --> 00:32:52,180
I've got the best agent in the world.

416
00:32:53,025 --> 00:32:55,391
Get me those 8 x 10s.

417
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,400
Hi.

418
00:33:08,808 --> 00:33:10,969
You work here?

419
00:33:11,544 --> 00:33:13,034
I don't work here.

420
00:33:13,546 --> 00:33:14,604
So...

421
00:33:15,548 --> 00:33:17,243
...you're a writer or something?

422
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,713
You're an actor?

423
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,015
Jane Deacy just signed me.

424
00:33:21,221 --> 00:33:23,553
Well, congratulations.

425
00:33:24,658 --> 00:33:26,057
Are you an actor?

426
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,455
Actress. I'm an actress.

427
00:33:28,662 --> 00:33:31,223
What are you writing,
Miss Actress?

428
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,957
Audition scene.

429
00:33:33,635 --> 00:33:35,125
Yeah? Who wrote it?

430
00:33:35,337 --> 00:33:37,202
That's what I'm trying to do.

431
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:39,066
Can I see it?

432
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:40,741
Yeah.

433
00:33:41,109 --> 00:33:43,271
Well, this is the first page.

434
00:33:57,094 --> 00:34:00,222
- So?
- Yeah, this is good.

435
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,657
What are you auditioning for?

436
00:34:02,866 --> 00:34:03,855
The Studio.

437
00:34:06,269 --> 00:34:07,531
Actors Studio?

438
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:09,034
Yeah.

439
00:34:10,808 --> 00:34:12,105
Wow.

440
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:16,441
Brando's like some kind
of lifetime member there, right?

441
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:18,270
Yeah.

442
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:21,376
What's your name?

443
00:34:21,787 --> 00:34:23,448
No, wait, don't, don't, don't.

444
00:34:24,323 --> 00:34:26,621
- Why not?
- I don't know.

445
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:28,782
How about...

446
00:34:30,996 --> 00:34:33,864
How about I take you out tonight?

447
00:34:34,234 --> 00:34:36,702
I'll give you a ride on my motorcycle.

448
00:34:38,037 --> 00:34:41,336
And then after I take you home
after the movie...

449
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:45,569
...when I lean in to kiss,
you can tell me then.

450
00:34:49,016 --> 00:34:50,176
You got a scene partner?

451
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:52,643
I did.

452
00:34:53,654 --> 00:34:54,848
Come on!

453
00:34:58,427 --> 00:35:00,759
- I can't...
- Come on!

454
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:02,929
- Come on!
- Let's do it!

455
00:35:03,165 --> 00:35:04,427
Let's go!

456
00:35:10,005 --> 00:35:11,496
Oh, this is great.

457
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,279
What's the matter?

458
00:35:26,523 --> 00:35:27,751
White.

459
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:29,717
Christine White.

460
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,358
My name.

461
00:35:32,529 --> 00:35:33,962
Good to meet you.

462
00:35:37,035 --> 00:35:41,472
Okay, I need Morty Chase
and Stanley Rushton.

463
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:44,231
Yes, gentlemen, please. Thank you.

464
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:47,206
Ah, excuse me. Excuse me.

465
00:35:48,046 --> 00:35:49,275
Who's watching the auditions?

466
00:35:49,482 --> 00:35:52,542
Kazan, Lee Strasberg,
and Cheryl Crawford.

467
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,653
- They're all here.
- Who?

468
00:35:55,888 --> 00:35:59,449
Strasberg, Elia Kazan
and Cheryl Crawford.

469
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,490
- Oh, my God.
- Good.

470
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,728
Hey, that's my prop! Don't drink it!

471
00:36:10,937 --> 00:36:14,840
Jimmy. Jimmy, stop! Come on.

472
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:18,276
You just drank my prop, Jimmy.

473
00:36:18,479 --> 00:36:21,209
Okay, Christine White and James Dean?

474
00:36:21,415 --> 00:36:22,473
Yes, that's us.

475
00:36:22,683 --> 00:36:25,743
- You're on next. Are you ready?
- We're ready. Thank you.

476
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,511
Oh, my God.

477
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:29,883
Where are your glasses?

478
00:36:30,092 --> 00:36:31,559
No, they're wrong for my character.

479
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,955
Wait, can you see anything
without your glasses?

480
00:36:34,162 --> 00:36:36,596
Yeah, I see fine.
What do you think, man? How-

481
00:36:37,432 --> 00:36:39,594
Yeah, very, very funny.
Put on your glasses.

482
00:36:39,802 --> 00:36:42,066
I can't, Chris.
They're back at my place.

483
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:43,830
Why'd you leave them at your place?

484
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:47,066
They're wrong for my character.
I don't want to be tempted to use them.

485
00:36:47,277 --> 00:36:49,177
Dean, White, let's go!

486
00:36:50,046 --> 00:36:51,344
Oh, sorry. I didn't-

487
00:36:51,549 --> 00:36:54,712
That's a chair.
You're apologizing to a chair.

488
00:36:55,986 --> 00:36:57,715
I'm telling you, Jimmy, you never know.

489
00:36:57,955 --> 00:36:59,855
Look at me when I auditioned
for Tennessee Williams.

490
00:37:00,057 --> 00:37:01,718
I thought I was terrible.

491
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:04,959
You were terrible.
You didn't get the part.

492
00:37:05,163 --> 00:37:07,028
It's just a detail.

493
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:09,222
Hi.

494
00:37:09,467 --> 00:37:11,492
I'm Rogers Brackett.

495
00:37:11,903 --> 00:37:14,337
Oh, God. The director?

496
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:19,807
A mutual friend tells me that
you're enormously talented.

497
00:37:22,815 --> 00:37:24,043
Yeah, I guess.

498
00:37:25,585 --> 00:37:29,454
I know of something that
you just might be right for.

499
00:37:29,656 --> 00:37:33,217
A TV drama. It's a very good role.

500
00:37:33,427 --> 00:37:36,396
So... would you like to audition?

501
00:37:37,331 --> 00:37:38,662
Yeah, sure.

502
00:37:39,399 --> 00:37:43,530
There's a party at my place tonight.
How would you feel about stopping by?

503
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:46,735
We could chat about the project.

504
00:37:47,875 --> 00:37:49,536
There'll be some interesting men there.

505
00:37:52,413 --> 00:37:55,212
Yeah, that sounds like a ball.

506
00:37:56,852 --> 00:37:57,841
Here's my card.

507
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:01,113
Why don't you come by late?

508
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:03,450
Say midnight?

509
00:38:05,027 --> 00:38:07,360
Yeah, midnight. That...

510
00:38:07,597 --> 00:38:08,859
Perfect.

511
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:11,359
Good. See you later.

512
00:38:12,435 --> 00:38:13,766
Right on.

513
00:38:16,106 --> 00:38:19,042
That man's a class-A faygalah,
you know that, right?

514
00:38:20,044 --> 00:38:24,037
Yeah, the man's a class-A faygalah
with a paying job.

515
00:38:44,069 --> 00:38:46,834
Oh, Lord, you look like Hamlet!

516
00:38:47,306 --> 00:38:48,739
Come in.

517
00:39:06,827 --> 00:39:08,124
I'm drumming. Go to hell!

518
00:39:08,328 --> 00:39:11,457
Come on, Jimmy. It's important!

519
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:15,702
Open up, open up! Come on!

520
00:39:15,904 --> 00:39:17,166
Come on!

521
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,134
You want to break my door down?

522
00:39:20,975 --> 00:39:23,069
- What's that?
- Actors Studio.

523
00:39:23,279 --> 00:39:25,076
- Let me see.
- No.

524
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:27,577
Chris, let me see.

525
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,410
- Chris!
- Wait, wait!

526
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:32,086
- I'm gonna pour water on you.
- Wait, wait, wait!

527
00:39:33,689 --> 00:39:34,782
You want to open it?

528
00:39:35,258 --> 00:39:36,316
Or should I?

529
00:39:42,866 --> 00:39:43,958
Here, you do it.

530
00:39:47,038 --> 00:39:48,528
Oh, God.

531
00:39:54,545 --> 00:39:55,534
Come on!

532
00:40:07,726 --> 00:40:08,715
What?

533
00:40:10,629 --> 00:40:11,892
We're in.

534
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,065
Both of us?

535
00:40:15,335 --> 00:40:19,032
Both of us. We are in!

536
00:40:23,977 --> 00:40:27,004
Give me that Actors Studio butt!

537
00:40:37,592 --> 00:40:39,059
Dear Father...

538
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:42,662
...I hope you're well.
I think of you often.

539
00:40:43,198 --> 00:40:45,359
My life in New York is a happy one.

540
00:40:45,634 --> 00:40:47,898
I'm finding work as an actor.

541
00:40:48,103 --> 00:40:50,937
I'm in a TVplay
that will be broadcast live...

542
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:53,574
...all over the country
in two weeks' time.

543
00:40:53,776 --> 00:40:55,744
I hope you can watch.

544
00:40:58,681 --> 00:41:00,239
And he'd yell up to me:

545
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:04,910
"Yo, Joey.

546
00:41:05,589 --> 00:41:08,956
Come on down and play, Joey.

547
00:41:09,193 --> 00:41:11,593
Joey. "

548
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,530
I hate to be wrong, but you were right.

549
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,192
Thank you, Louie.

550
00:41:23,241 --> 00:41:27,201
Jimmy, you were fantastic!
I'm so proud. We all watched.

551
00:41:27,413 --> 00:41:28,937
Saw it, saw it.

552
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:34,050
Here, here, here. Double Black Label,
the nectar of the gods.

553
00:41:34,253 --> 00:41:37,780
- Jerry, give me two more of these.
- Thank you.

554
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:40,585
That's for me, man.
I was just on national TV.

555
00:41:40,794 --> 00:41:43,456
So you're on TV,
and too cheap to buy me a drink.

556
00:41:43,663 --> 00:41:45,130
Raise your glasses, everybody.

557
00:41:45,332 --> 00:41:48,859
Raise your glasses.
I'd like to make a toast to James Dean...

558
00:41:49,069 --> 00:41:53,097
...who's just achieved
what we all aspire to. Paid work!

559
00:41:57,645 --> 00:42:00,079
Father, it's James.

560
00:42:01,082 --> 00:42:04,883
Did you get a chance
to watch the play on TV?

561
00:42:08,991 --> 00:42:13,189
It was tonight.
It was the one I wrote you about.

562
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:24,105
No. No, I don't mind.

563
00:42:25,608 --> 00:42:26,939
I understand.

564
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,781
Yes, sir.

565
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:16,052
Okay, James Dean is next. James Dean!

566
00:43:16,263 --> 00:43:17,355
Yeah.

567
00:43:27,175 --> 00:43:28,836
That's James Dean.

568
00:43:30,044 --> 00:43:33,412
Mr. Dean, you're reading
for an Arab, not a cowboy.

569
00:43:33,615 --> 00:43:35,105
Would you mind removing your hat?

570
00:43:35,451 --> 00:43:36,679
Sure.

571
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:48,726
Can you read
with broken glasses?

572
00:43:49,332 --> 00:43:51,391
No, not so well, but...

573
00:43:51,701 --> 00:43:55,694
I'd like to give it a shot, if you
don't mind, Mr. Rose and Mr. Mann.

574
00:43:57,207 --> 00:44:00,439
It's okay with me. Let's start from...

575
00:44:00,878 --> 00:44:04,609
...act two, scene one,
Bachir's entrance.

576
00:44:05,316 --> 00:44:09,480
Okay, page 36. We're gonna
pick it up in the middle of the page.

577
00:44:14,259 --> 00:44:15,590
Right there.

578
00:44:22,734 --> 00:44:25,898
"Sir, did that doctor tell you
anything about me, sir?"

579
00:44:26,105 --> 00:44:28,335
"Why? Is there something to tell?"

580
00:44:30,109 --> 00:44:31,838
"Uh, no, sir. "

581
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,079
"He's a- He's a good doctor. "

582
00:44:36,683 --> 00:44:37,911
"Are you hungry?"

583
00:44:38,118 --> 00:44:39,176
"No. "

584
00:44:41,688 --> 00:44:42,950
Okay.

585
00:44:47,929 --> 00:44:49,920
I'm sorry, I...

586
00:44:50,231 --> 00:44:53,997
I'm having trouble
seeing through the tape on my glasses.

587
00:44:54,202 --> 00:44:56,033
How long will it take to fix them?

588
00:44:57,338 --> 00:44:59,670
It's not the time, it's...

589
00:44:59,874 --> 00:45:01,342
It's the 10 bucks.

590
00:45:03,179 --> 00:45:04,441
Hang on.

591
00:45:05,481 --> 00:45:06,607
Come here, kid.

592
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:14,723
Get your glasses fixed.

593
00:45:15,525 --> 00:45:18,050
Come back this afternoon. Around 4:30?

594
00:45:20,163 --> 00:45:22,996
Yeah, okay, 4:30's great.

595
00:45:25,035 --> 00:45:28,130
- All right, thank you.
- Don't forget your hat.

596
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:29,670
All right.

597
00:45:31,242 --> 00:45:33,506
That's a nice rose there.

598
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:39,040
Nice kid.

599
00:45:41,186 --> 00:45:43,313
- You think?
- He's adorable.

600
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:49,855
Now, let's try it again, okay?
Let's do one more.

601
00:45:51,431 --> 00:45:52,728
We can get it this time.

602
00:45:53,333 --> 00:45:54,391
Okay.

603
00:45:55,168 --> 00:45:58,228
Sir, did the doctor tell you
anything about me?

604
00:45:58,438 --> 00:46:01,100
No, no, no, no. That doctor.

605
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:04,807
There's another "sir" at the end.
See it?

606
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,775
Let's try it again.

607
00:46:08,115 --> 00:46:12,142
Sir, did that doctor tell you
anything about me, sir?

608
00:46:12,353 --> 00:46:14,184
Perfect!

609
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:17,224
All right, here.
You got change for a 10?

610
00:46:21,129 --> 00:46:22,221
Sir...

611
00:46:23,465 --> 00:46:27,196
...did that doctor tell you
anything about me, sir?

612
00:46:28,571 --> 00:46:31,062
"Why? Is there something to tell?"

613
00:46:31,274 --> 00:46:34,402
Oh, no, sir. He's a good doctor.

614
00:46:37,947 --> 00:46:39,380
Are you hungry?

615
00:46:45,155 --> 00:46:46,383
"No. "

616
00:46:48,358 --> 00:46:50,588
I brought it too soon.

617
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:53,224
What a shame.

618
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:56,426
That's enough.

619
00:46:57,068 --> 00:46:59,468
- Thank you, Jimmy.
- Wait, wait, wait.

620
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:02,263
I really like him, Danny.

621
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:04,538
He's good.

622
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:08,903
- A little too weird, though.
- I'd like to hear him read with Geri.

623
00:47:09,982 --> 00:47:11,415
I'll try it.

624
00:47:13,819 --> 00:47:15,787
Can you stick around
for a half-hour?

625
00:47:15,988 --> 00:47:18,423
We'd like you to read
with Geraldine Page.

626
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,660
Yeah, sure, I'll...

627
00:47:22,862 --> 00:47:26,263
I'm open. I'll be over there.

628
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:31,128
You took my 10 bucks
and didn't get your glasses fixed!

629
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,501
Yeah, I used it to eat.

630
00:47:35,876 --> 00:47:38,970
But I memorized it
so I didn't have to read it.

631
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:40,813
Do you...

632
00:47:42,283 --> 00:47:43,307
...forgive me?

633
00:47:44,553 --> 00:47:45,645
Sure.

634
00:47:47,589 --> 00:47:49,454
We're very interested in you
for this part.

635
00:47:51,293 --> 00:47:52,521
Thanks.

636
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,695
Biskra is a confusing place.
Don't you think so, Michel?

637
00:48:04,107 --> 00:48:05,096
No.

638
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:07,707
Well, perhaps not.

639
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:12,280
Perhaps I think so because
you've been in that awful hospital.

640
00:48:12,483 --> 00:48:15,748
Jimmy, come on, that's your cue.
Come on, get up.

641
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:22,251
Ah, sorry.

642
00:48:22,727 --> 00:48:24,695
Madame, I'm...

643
00:48:26,231 --> 00:48:29,223
...so happy that my gentleman
came home that...

644
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:31,066
...I was too lively.

645
00:48:31,269 --> 00:48:35,229
Hold it! Hold it!
Everybody, take 10.

646
00:48:35,508 --> 00:48:37,635
We're on 10, but let's stay close!

647
00:48:37,843 --> 00:48:40,437
Jimmy, come over here. Over here!

648
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:44,939
Come on! Clear the set,
but don't go too far.

649
00:48:51,792 --> 00:48:53,020
Sit.

650
00:48:59,033 --> 00:49:01,593
Now, I've been saying this
40 ways to Christmas...

651
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:03,896
...but you don't seem to want
to get it through your head.

652
00:49:04,105 --> 00:49:05,732
- Thick head.
- What?

653
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:09,735
The expression is
"get it through your thick head. "

654
00:49:11,547 --> 00:49:15,711
I'm breaking my ass trying
to get this turkey off the ground.

655
00:49:15,918 --> 00:49:18,614
I have no time for your games.

656
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:22,018
Now, the name of the play
is The Immoralist.

657
00:49:22,224 --> 00:49:24,193
It's not
"Let's Hear James Dean Mumble. "

658
00:49:24,394 --> 00:49:26,362
When will I have the privilege...

659
00:49:26,563 --> 00:49:29,657
...of hearing you clearly?

660
00:49:33,503 --> 00:49:36,837
I have been extremely patient thus far.

661
00:49:37,742 --> 00:49:40,870
But frankly, you cut my part down
so much, I don't even know...

662
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,012
...who I am playing anymore.

663
00:49:43,381 --> 00:49:44,905
And this upsets me.

664
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:48,147
If that means mumbling
through rehearsals...

665
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:51,015
...then you'll have
to be patient too.

666
00:49:51,623 --> 00:49:52,817
Okay?

667
00:50:06,305 --> 00:50:08,865
How'd you like that acting?

668
00:50:09,308 --> 00:50:10,468
Could you hear me okay?

669
00:50:11,711 --> 00:50:13,611
It's very convincing.

670
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,283
While we were rehearsing
The Immoralist...

671
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:27,257
...I got a call from Jane Deacy
to audition for Elia Kazan...

672
00:50:27,462 --> 00:50:29,293
...for East of Eden.

673
00:50:29,531 --> 00:50:32,694
Kazan had directed Brando
in Streetcar...

674
00:50:33,134 --> 00:50:34,328
...and On the Waterfront.

675
00:50:46,682 --> 00:50:48,172
Morning, Jimmy.

676
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:52,053
Have a seat.

677
00:51:08,172 --> 00:51:09,833
Tell us about yourself, Jimmy.

678
00:51:15,012 --> 00:51:16,070
Well...

679
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:21,945
You know, there's not much to tell.
I was born in Indiana...

680
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:26,917
...and moved out to California
when I was about 5...

681
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,428
...till I was 9...

682
00:51:31,097 --> 00:51:32,428
...when my mother died.

683
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:34,789
And then...

684
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:41,099
...I was sent back to Indiana to live
with my aunt and uncle on a farm.

685
00:51:41,876 --> 00:51:43,537
What was it like living on a farm?

686
00:51:48,249 --> 00:51:50,581
I wasn't much of a farmer.

687
00:51:54,255 --> 00:51:55,814
I rode my motorcycle.

688
00:51:57,392 --> 00:51:58,950
I used to...

689
00:52:00,662 --> 00:52:02,391
...chase the cows.

690
00:52:02,864 --> 00:52:06,630
They'd run and their udders
would swing from side to side.

691
00:52:07,336 --> 00:52:08,496
How about your father?

692
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:14,408
Well, we don't...

693
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,407
We don't really talk much.

694
00:52:19,917 --> 00:52:22,010
We don't like each other.

695
00:52:25,322 --> 00:52:27,415
In fact, we hate each other.

696
00:52:31,528 --> 00:52:33,759
See, I'm an actor because...

697
00:52:33,965 --> 00:52:35,956
...it's how I express myself.

698
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:39,102
I'm not very good with talking.

699
00:52:39,771 --> 00:52:41,602
I think you can tell.

700
00:52:44,777 --> 00:52:46,574
When do you open in the Gide play?

701
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:48,940
Next Thursday.

702
00:52:49,148 --> 00:52:52,049
Mr. Steinbeck and I
will be coming on-

703
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:54,951
If you're coming, don't tell me when.

704
00:52:55,654 --> 00:52:56,985
It's better if I don't know.

705
00:52:59,159 --> 00:53:00,854
You think you can handle Cal?

706
00:53:03,029 --> 00:53:04,690
Yes, I do, sir.

707
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:06,123
Good.

708
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,334
We'll contact your agent.
Jane Deacy, right?

709
00:53:10,538 --> 00:53:12,062
Right. Yeah.

710
00:53:14,175 --> 00:53:15,164
Is that it?

711
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:16,972
That's it.

712
00:53:21,849 --> 00:53:22,976
Thanks.

713
00:53:29,491 --> 00:53:32,085
That's the kid I want
to go with for Cal.

714
00:53:34,998 --> 00:53:36,727
What do you think?

715
00:53:37,333 --> 00:53:40,894
Mr. Kazan, that young man is Cal.

716
00:53:41,771 --> 00:53:44,501
Five minutes, Miss Page.
Five minutes, Mr. Jourdan.

717
00:53:44,707 --> 00:53:47,404
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know, Mr. Rose.

718
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:49,442
Geri. Geri.

719
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,873
Oh, my heart. Oh, my God.

720
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:54,016
- Can't catch my breath.
- You're the greatest actress.

721
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:56,083
Go enjoy yourself.

722
00:53:56,286 --> 00:53:59,153
Louis! How are you?
Look how handsome you are.

723
00:53:59,356 --> 00:54:01,291
- Merde!
- Merde!

724
00:54:02,127 --> 00:54:04,789
Look, five minutes. Five minutes!

725
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:07,089
I want that understudy dressed.
We're going up in 10.

726
00:54:07,298 --> 00:54:09,732
It's already done.
We looked everywhere!

727
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:12,426
Get this kid on a leash.
Put him on a leash!

728
00:54:12,638 --> 00:54:14,401
How is this happening?

729
00:54:23,983 --> 00:54:27,476
Are you crazy? You're on
in three minutes! Get dressed!

730
00:54:38,733 --> 00:54:39,631
Good job, Jimmy!

731
00:54:39,834 --> 00:54:43,292
Jimmy! Come over here.
I'm so proud of you.

732
00:54:43,705 --> 00:54:46,299
So proud of you.
You're gonna be a star!

733
00:54:46,507 --> 00:54:48,168
I'll be right back.

734
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:54,478
You were better than I ever imagined.

735
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:56,207
- Thanks, beautiful.
- Ever!

736
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,717
Louis, you're improving.
You raised both hands upstage.

737
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,585
IKid, kid. You stole the show!

738
00:55:02,859 --> 00:55:06,226
We can run a year on your reviews.
Congratulations!

739
00:55:06,429 --> 00:55:09,091
Congratulations. What's this?

740
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:11,324
My two-week notice. I'm quitting.

741
00:55:11,534 --> 00:55:15,062
- Oh, very funny. Very funny!
- I'm not joking.

742
00:55:15,272 --> 00:55:18,366
I've got a movie.
I'm going to California in two weeks.

743
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:20,774
You're not kidding?

744
00:55:20,978 --> 00:55:22,138
No.

745
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,450
Good luck to you, kid.

746
00:55:35,227 --> 00:55:37,252
Why'd I do it like that, Marty?

747
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:42,025
He was nice to me. Why must I
make people reject me? Why?

748
00:55:42,235 --> 00:55:45,398
You're an ambitious,
selfish son of a bitch.

749
00:56:08,096 --> 00:56:09,529
Mr. Kazan.

750
00:56:09,731 --> 00:56:13,963
Can we make a stop near here?
There's somebody I want you to meet.

751
00:56:14,169 --> 00:56:15,693
An actor?

752
00:56:16,771 --> 00:56:19,104
No, sir, it's my father.

753
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:25,238
I'd love to, but another time.
We really have to keep moving.

754
00:56:25,514 --> 00:56:26,947
Please, sir?

755
00:56:27,583 --> 00:56:29,175
It's important.

756
00:56:31,021 --> 00:56:32,716
- Driver.
- We can go?

757
00:56:32,923 --> 00:56:34,015
Sure.

758
00:56:34,791 --> 00:56:36,418
Take a right, the next right.

759
00:56:39,763 --> 00:56:41,060
Father.

760
00:56:42,599 --> 00:56:43,658
Hello.

761
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:50,637
This is Mr. Elia Kazan.
He's directing the film that I'm doing.

762
00:56:51,542 --> 00:56:53,601
- Happy to meet you, sir.
- Same here.

763
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:58,408
And you two will have to tell me when
this moving picture of yours comes out...

764
00:56:58,917 --> 00:57:00,475
...so Ethel and I can go see it.

765
00:57:00,919 --> 00:57:03,285
Yeah, you'll be
the first person I tell.

766
00:57:03,488 --> 00:57:05,183
Well, that's good.

767
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:08,883
I'm sorry, but I can't invite you in.

768
00:57:09,095 --> 00:57:12,121
Ethel and I are expecting guests.

769
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,630
Thank you, sir, for taking Jim
into your moving picture.

770
00:57:20,774 --> 00:57:23,368
- Nice to see you, Father.
- Thanks for the time, Mr. Dean.

771
00:57:23,577 --> 00:57:24,908
Yes, sir.

772
00:57:32,586 --> 00:57:33,849
Winnie.

773
00:57:34,456 --> 00:57:35,514
Winnie.

774
00:57:36,591 --> 00:57:38,183
That must have hurt.

775
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:41,785
We'll use it.

776
00:57:47,003 --> 00:57:49,164
All your boy has to do is sign it.

777
00:57:51,908 --> 00:57:54,433
Jane Deacy hooked me up
with Dick Clayton...

778
00:57:54,644 --> 00:57:57,135
...an agent to look
after me in Hollywood.

779
00:57:59,716 --> 00:58:01,911
Here we go.
We're all signed, Mr. Warner.

780
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:06,383
Before we start shooting Eden,
I think I'm gonna send your boy off...

781
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:09,354
...to Palm Springs
for a couple of weeks.

782
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:12,290
Have you lying out in the sun,
get a tan.

783
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:15,456
Maybe we should
fatten him up a bit too.

784
00:58:15,967 --> 00:58:17,867
You're too skinny. Way too skinny.

785
00:58:18,069 --> 00:58:19,969
You look like a refugee.

786
00:58:20,238 --> 00:58:23,036
You're never gonna get rich
unless you look rich.

787
00:58:23,242 --> 00:58:24,334
Jack.

788
00:58:25,978 --> 00:58:28,242
IKid's been seen around town
riding a motorcycle.

789
00:58:28,948 --> 00:58:31,610
How much am I getting paid for this?

790
00:58:31,817 --> 00:58:34,718
Thousand a week,
10 weeks guaranteed.

791
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:38,884
This true?

792
00:58:39,693 --> 00:58:40,853
You ride a motorcycle?

793
00:58:41,795 --> 00:58:44,730
Oh, yeah. I...

794
00:58:44,998 --> 00:58:47,228
I just bought a Triumph 110.

795
00:58:47,434 --> 00:58:50,427
You know, like they used
in The Wild Ones?

796
00:58:50,638 --> 00:58:51,764
Get rid of it.

797
00:58:51,973 --> 00:58:54,942
The studio backs stars, not corpses.

798
00:58:55,676 --> 00:58:57,143
You understand me, don't you?

799
00:58:59,113 --> 00:59:00,705
Say yes.

800
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:04,947
Yeah.

801
00:59:05,153 --> 00:59:06,711
Attaboy.

802
00:59:06,955 --> 00:59:07,979
Thank you, Dick.

803
00:59:08,223 --> 00:59:11,659
What's wonderful about Massey
is that he's easy to get off guard.

804
00:59:11,860 --> 00:59:14,295
He's so stiff and he's so wooden that...

805
00:59:14,497 --> 00:59:18,490
...those quick moments are
the moments that I'm gonna use.

806
00:59:18,701 --> 00:59:20,134
Those are the wonderful moments.

807
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:23,464
What I want you to do when
we're dealing with the Bible scene...

808
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:28,043
...just on his close-ups, is to swear
like never before...

809
00:59:28,245 --> 00:59:30,475
...because he hates that stuff.

810
00:59:30,681 --> 00:59:34,082
He hates it. He's so wooden,
but it works for us. It's wonderful.

811
00:59:35,252 --> 00:59:36,446
Who's that?

812
00:59:37,287 --> 00:59:39,313
That's Caesar and that's Brutus.

813
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:40,684
No.

814
00:59:41,326 --> 00:59:42,793
The girl.

815
00:59:43,428 --> 00:59:47,626
It's Pier Angeli. She's working
opposite Newman in Silver Chalice.

816
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:51,632
Do me a favor.

817
00:59:51,837 --> 00:59:55,000
Bring the guy in the skirt over here.

818
00:59:55,674 --> 00:59:57,904
Come on, he looks more like your type.

819
01:00:00,546 --> 01:00:02,343
Can I have a word with you?

820
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,418
- Hello. What is your name?
- Stephan.

821
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:10,155
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

822
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,588
Oh, my God, I have to ask.
Where did you find that dress?

823
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:17,561
I've been looking everywhere
for something like this.

824
01:00:18,566 --> 01:00:21,433
You may try it on
if you want.

825
01:00:22,203 --> 01:00:25,900
I hear he's up against Paul Newman
for the big fight movie MGM's doing.

826
01:00:26,107 --> 01:00:28,668
Well, I'm sure he'd trade in
the movie for the girl.

827
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:31,368
- What girl?
- That girl.

828
01:00:34,183 --> 01:00:36,378
He's gonna have a problem there.

829
01:00:36,585 --> 01:00:37,984
What do you mean?

830
01:00:48,498 --> 01:00:49,931
And who is this?

831
01:00:50,133 --> 01:00:54,571
Mama, this is James Dean.
He's an actor.

832
01:00:54,972 --> 01:00:58,635
This is my mother, Mrs. Pierangeli.

833
01:00:59,944 --> 01:01:03,345
So, what do you want
with my daughter?

834
01:01:06,585 --> 01:01:07,711
Nothing.

835
01:01:07,919 --> 01:01:10,581
Good. You won't be disappointed.

836
01:01:40,888 --> 01:01:41,946
Hands up.

837
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,557
Go, go, go, go!

838
01:01:55,637 --> 01:01:59,836
Her real name was
Anna Maria Pierangeli.

839
01:02:00,409 --> 01:02:03,742
I loved her like
I'd never loved anyone.

840
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,076
She was my reason for being alive.

841
01:02:07,416 --> 01:02:09,885
I used to wish that if she died...

842
01:02:10,086 --> 01:02:12,987
...that I would die
in the very same moment.

843
01:02:13,823 --> 01:02:18,157
I borrowed a beach house in Malibu
where we could be totally alone.

844
01:02:31,108 --> 01:02:33,042
Higher, higher, higher, higher.

845
01:02:39,618 --> 01:02:41,142
One, two, three.

846
01:02:50,897 --> 01:02:51,921
Come on in here, kid.

847
01:02:58,471 --> 01:03:02,738
I got an actress' mother telling me
that you're molesting her daughter.

848
01:03:02,943 --> 01:03:06,470
It's lucky I've been watching your
dailies or you'd be out on your ass.

849
01:03:07,615 --> 01:03:11,073
It's walnut.
You scratch that, it costs me $2000.

850
01:03:14,289 --> 01:03:15,756
That's more polite.

851
01:03:15,957 --> 01:03:17,117
You got anything else?

852
01:03:17,792 --> 01:03:20,283
Yes, there's plenty else, wise guy.

853
01:03:20,495 --> 01:03:22,463
If you're thinking
of marrying her, forget it.

854
01:03:22,664 --> 01:03:26,396
You think 14- and 15-year-old girls
want their heartthrob married?

855
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:29,070
On the other hand,
you want to marry Miss Ravioli?

856
01:03:29,272 --> 01:03:31,433
Go ahead.
Find yourself another studio.

857
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,742
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

858
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:37,413
You got two weeks left on Eden.

859
01:03:37,614 --> 01:03:40,811
I know Nick Ray's been talking to you
about Rebel Without a Cause.

860
01:03:41,018 --> 01:03:44,351
And he wants you for it.
But you know what I told him?

861
01:03:44,554 --> 01:03:46,920
I told him I gotta think about it.

862
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:49,924
Is there anything else?

863
01:03:51,696 --> 01:03:55,359
Don't play it smart with me, Jimmy.
I'm tougher than you.

864
01:03:57,468 --> 01:03:59,299
A lot tougher.

865
01:04:00,338 --> 01:04:02,170
Now get out of my car, please.

866
01:04:07,379 --> 01:04:08,505
Drive on.

867
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:12,749
Put your chin right there. That's good.

868
01:04:12,951 --> 01:04:15,443
You know, because she's Catholic.

869
01:04:15,655 --> 01:04:17,987
So she's not going to break us up
once we're married.

870
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:21,855
Jimmy, we just need to be married.

871
01:04:22,128 --> 01:04:23,789
Put the cig in your mouth.

872
01:04:25,298 --> 01:04:26,265
Eyes here.

873
01:04:26,466 --> 01:04:29,334
- Can you understand me?
- Yes.

874
01:04:30,071 --> 01:04:31,163
Yes?

875
01:04:31,572 --> 01:04:32,561
You do?

876
01:04:32,773 --> 01:04:34,434
Get over here.
I understand you.

877
01:04:34,642 --> 01:04:38,578
We've gone over it cinquanta times.

878
01:04:38,846 --> 01:04:40,314
Go over there. Get right.

879
01:04:40,515 --> 01:04:42,710
Why do we have to wait?

880
01:04:42,918 --> 01:04:44,681
Oh, that's perfect.

881
01:04:44,986 --> 01:04:46,851
That's perfect.

882
01:04:47,055 --> 01:04:48,317
Why do we have to wait?

883
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:51,157
I'm making a movie right now.

884
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:55,058
Oh, God, you look great.
You look like...

885
01:04:55,264 --> 01:04:57,323
You look like the Madonna.

886
01:04:59,335 --> 01:05:00,927
We can elope.

887
01:05:01,337 --> 01:05:02,895
We can elope.

888
01:05:03,106 --> 01:05:04,164
Yes!

889
01:05:04,374 --> 01:05:06,673
Sure, that's crazy.

890
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:09,539
Hey, hey, look at me. All right.

891
01:05:09,747 --> 01:05:11,237
Come here. Look, look, look.

892
01:05:13,217 --> 01:05:16,152
Just let me finish making this movie...

893
01:05:16,353 --> 01:05:18,345
...and then we'll get married.

894
01:05:18,723 --> 01:05:20,520
- Yes.
- I promise.

895
01:05:20,925 --> 01:05:24,224
Well, maybe my mother's right.

896
01:05:25,897 --> 01:05:29,264
Maybe you're just using me
to get into the papers.

897
01:05:29,567 --> 01:05:30,933
How can you think that?

898
01:05:31,137 --> 01:05:33,264
That's what my mother thinks.

899
01:05:33,472 --> 01:05:34,996
That's your mother, not you.

900
01:05:35,574 --> 01:05:39,977
Okay? Can we just have
one night here, alone...

901
01:05:40,179 --> 01:05:42,546
...without your mother in bed with us?

902
01:05:48,388 --> 01:05:50,379
She wants me to marry Vic Damone.

903
01:05:51,825 --> 01:05:52,814
She what?

904
01:05:53,059 --> 01:05:56,757
She wants me to marry Vic Damone.
You know, he's Catholic.

905
01:05:56,964 --> 01:05:57,988
She likes him a lot.

906
01:05:58,266 --> 01:06:00,200
So is the Pope.
Why don't you marry him?

907
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:01,766
I can't fight her!

908
01:06:01,969 --> 01:06:03,834
Why not? Don't you have
a will of your own?

909
01:06:04,305 --> 01:06:06,796
- It's not about will!
- What is it?

910
01:06:07,008 --> 01:06:10,274
It's a matter of family
and being Catholic!

911
01:06:10,479 --> 01:06:11,503
- Listen.
- What?

912
01:06:12,147 --> 01:06:14,980
You tell Vic Damone
and your crazy mother...

913
01:06:15,184 --> 01:06:17,243
...to stay out of our lives,
all right?

914
01:06:17,453 --> 01:06:19,114
- You don't understand!
- I understand!

915
01:06:19,321 --> 01:06:22,086
- You're not listening!
- Stop yelling at me!

916
01:06:31,367 --> 01:06:32,699
Open it.

917
01:06:50,589 --> 01:06:52,614
I love Aron, I do.

918
01:06:53,859 --> 01:06:55,827
Really, I do.

919
01:06:56,628 --> 01:06:58,290
I do, I do.

920
01:07:03,503 --> 01:07:04,868
Cut.

921
01:07:07,006 --> 01:07:11,239
Jimmy, wonderful.
It was just wonderful.

922
01:07:12,012 --> 01:07:14,640
- Julie, you're beautiful. Beautiful.
- Thank you.

923
01:07:16,083 --> 01:07:20,486
Ladies and gentlemen, that's a print,
a wrap, and we are finished!

924
01:07:26,227 --> 01:07:29,492
Have you seen Jimmy?
He's not in his trailer.

925
01:07:34,235 --> 01:07:35,225
Jimmy?

926
01:07:37,907 --> 01:07:38,999
Come on up.

927
01:08:01,065 --> 01:08:02,692
You okay?

928
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:10,630
It's over.

929
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:16,308
I know, Jimmy.
It's so sad.

930
01:08:19,952 --> 01:08:23,149
You know, this is like my family.

931
01:08:26,826 --> 01:08:29,317
I can't just let that go.

932
01:08:46,246 --> 01:08:49,181
Always knew I would get
an actor like you for Rebel.

933
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,518
I think...

934
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:55,814
...divine fate calls the shots
for a director like me.

935
01:08:56,024 --> 01:08:57,958
You know what I mean? Brando.

936
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:01,925
What, are they kidding?
Brando is too old, man.

937
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:06,124
You are fresh.
You are perfect for this part. Perfect!

938
01:09:07,503 --> 01:09:08,834
We just gotta...

939
01:09:09,038 --> 01:09:10,801
We gotta find somebody...

940
01:09:11,007 --> 01:09:13,874
...somebody great for the girl.

941
01:09:17,014 --> 01:09:19,278
What about Natalie Wood?

942
01:09:20,484 --> 01:09:22,349
No, really, what do you think of her?

943
01:09:22,552 --> 01:09:25,146
I want to know.
I really want to know.

944
01:09:25,355 --> 01:09:28,450
Because, Jimmy, it's just you and I.

945
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,151
We are on this quest together, baby.

946
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:34,661
All the way down the line.
What do you think?

947
01:09:34,932 --> 01:09:37,230
She's a child star, man.

948
01:09:37,435 --> 01:09:38,868
Child star, huh?

949
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:42,268
Jimmy, this girl is 17 years old...

950
01:09:42,474 --> 01:09:46,604
...and she is built like the Pieta.

951
01:09:46,945 --> 01:09:48,378
I know. She doesn't look it, right?

952
01:09:48,580 --> 01:09:52,380
But I'm telling you that
underneath those simple childish...

953
01:09:52,584 --> 01:09:57,045
...cotton frocks, she is built
like a marble masterpiece.

954
01:09:59,359 --> 01:10:00,348
Jimmy.

955
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,494
- Jimmy, listen to me.
- What?

956
01:10:02,696 --> 01:10:03,993
You're young.

957
01:10:04,197 --> 01:10:05,859
You're wonderful and you're young...

958
01:10:06,067 --> 01:10:09,366
...but if you'd been there
for the start of Helen Hayes' career...

959
01:10:09,570 --> 01:10:11,629
...you would know
what I see in this girl.

960
01:10:11,839 --> 01:10:14,740
Genius. Pure genius.

961
01:10:15,342 --> 01:10:18,540
That's what I see in you, Jimmy.
Genius!

962
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:24,049
Man, Rebel Without a Cause...

963
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:28,018
...is gonna be the first
visionary movie ever made...

964
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:30,054
...about teenagers.

965
01:10:30,258 --> 01:10:33,854
You mark my word. Mark my word!

966
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:37,798
- You like jazz?
- Yeah, I like jazz.

967
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,399
Chet Baker mean anything to you?

968
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:41,659
Yeah.

969
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,402
He's playing down on the beach
tonight. You want to go?

970
01:10:45,876 --> 01:10:47,036
Yeah, I'd love to.

971
01:10:47,845 --> 01:10:49,142
Solid, baby.

972
01:10:49,346 --> 01:10:50,540
Solid.

973
01:10:52,082 --> 01:10:53,140
Pier!

974
01:10:53,584 --> 01:10:56,315
Pier, listen, I have to go to New York.

975
01:10:56,755 --> 01:11:00,191
I have to go to New York,
all right? Come here, look.

976
01:11:00,391 --> 01:11:01,380
What?

977
01:11:01,593 --> 01:11:04,619
Look, come to New York
with me, all right?

978
01:11:04,829 --> 01:11:07,559
I can't go to New York!
I can't leave my mother.

979
01:11:07,766 --> 01:11:08,927
Why?

980
01:11:09,135 --> 01:11:10,625
You wouldn't understand.

981
01:11:10,836 --> 01:11:12,565
- Look.
- What?

982
01:11:12,905 --> 01:11:15,135
It'll be two weeks, okay?
Two weeks.

983
01:11:15,341 --> 01:11:16,808
I have to be back to do Rebel.

984
01:11:17,009 --> 01:11:19,170
I may not be here
when you come back.

985
01:11:19,411 --> 01:11:21,539
- What?
- You heard me.

986
01:11:21,748 --> 01:11:23,716
I may not be here when you come back.

987
01:11:23,917 --> 01:11:25,282
What is that supposed to mean?

988
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:28,113
I don't want to stay here anymore!
I want to go!

989
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,318
James, I'm gone!

990
01:11:31,825 --> 01:11:33,156
Fine, go!

991
01:11:33,361 --> 01:11:34,794
I'm leaving! I'm gone!

992
01:11:35,062 --> 01:11:36,791
Hey, Pier!

993
01:11:37,799 --> 01:11:40,768
You're breaking my heart

994
01:11:40,968 --> 01:11:43,562
Cause you're leaving

995
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:15,403
Hi, is my father here?
I want to talk to him.

996
01:12:15,639 --> 01:12:17,163
He's away for a while.

997
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:20,810
Is there something that
I can help you with, James?

998
01:12:21,011 --> 01:12:23,708
No, no. I need to talk to him.

999
01:12:25,050 --> 01:12:26,984
I'll tell him that.

1000
01:12:28,086 --> 01:12:29,815
Are you all right, James?

1001
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:34,415
Yeah.

1002
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:38,825
We follow you in the newspapers.

1003
01:12:39,031 --> 01:12:42,330
Your father's very proud
of your success.

1004
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:44,996
He is?

1005
01:12:45,538 --> 01:12:47,972
Of course he is, James.

1006
01:12:52,279 --> 01:12:53,405
Thanks.

1007
01:12:55,349 --> 01:12:58,011
Nice to see you, James.

1008
01:13:00,687 --> 01:13:03,054
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

1009
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:21,368
Can't you even talk
to the boy, Winnie?

1010
01:13:21,577 --> 01:13:23,044
I can't.

1011
01:13:36,826 --> 01:13:39,022
Her mother wants her
to marry Vic Damone.

1012
01:13:39,330 --> 01:13:42,163
Why?
Can't she just buy one of his records?

1013
01:13:42,667 --> 01:13:46,467
- She's driving me bananas, Marty.
- For you, bananas is not a long drive.

1014
01:13:47,905 --> 01:13:49,065
Jimmy.

1015
01:13:49,307 --> 01:13:52,641
You guys are meant for each other.
It's perfect casting.

1016
01:13:53,278 --> 01:13:57,305
Pick up the phone, tell her
you love her, tell her you're sorry.

1017
01:13:57,516 --> 01:13:59,040
Tell her anything.

1018
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:01,242
Go, call her. You got the nickels.

1019
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,117
Pronto. Hello.

1020
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:08,352
Is Pier there?

1021
01:14:08,962 --> 01:14:09,951
Who is this?

1022
01:14:11,130 --> 01:14:12,188
It's James Dean.

1023
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,301
She does not want to talk.

1024
01:14:17,171 --> 01:14:18,968
Just put her on the phone, please!

1025
01:14:19,173 --> 01:14:23,610
No, no, no. She's out there
choosing the flowers for her wedding.

1026
01:14:23,844 --> 01:14:25,334
Goodbye.

1027
01:14:54,811 --> 01:14:57,279
I don't know where he is.

1028
01:14:57,481 --> 01:15:01,008
He'll show, Jack. It's a benefit
for the studio. He'll show.

1029
01:15:01,218 --> 01:15:02,947
I'll tell you something.

1030
01:15:03,153 --> 01:15:05,178
He doesn't show,
I'm gonna ruin the bastard.

1031
01:15:05,389 --> 01:15:07,051
Even if I have to pull
the plug on Rebel.

1032
01:15:07,258 --> 01:15:09,726
- Jack, you look great!
- Nice to see you.

1033
01:15:10,261 --> 01:15:13,230
We should get going, guys.
We'll be late.

1034
01:15:13,431 --> 01:15:15,160
All right, let me do it.

1035
01:15:22,074 --> 01:15:23,098
God!

1036
01:15:25,077 --> 01:15:27,477
- We're not going.
- What do you mean?

1037
01:15:27,679 --> 01:15:31,206
I'm not even interested
in this glitzy glamour crap, all right?

1038
01:15:31,417 --> 01:15:34,649
They want to wear monkey suits, fine!
Not me.

1039
01:15:34,854 --> 01:15:37,982
Jimmy, I spent $174 on this dress.
Come on.

1040
01:15:38,191 --> 01:15:39,351
This is my first tuxedo.

1041
01:15:39,559 --> 01:15:42,722
Jerry, why don't you give
a round to everybody on me?

1042
01:15:42,962 --> 01:15:44,487
We're spending the night.

1043
01:15:47,768 --> 01:15:50,134
Maybe he's laying dead somewhere.

1044
01:15:50,337 --> 01:15:52,202
That's no excuse.

1045
01:16:02,050 --> 01:16:04,951
Jack, congratulations. Fantastic.

1046
01:16:22,306 --> 01:16:25,469
What did I tell you, Hedda?
What did I tell you?

1047
01:16:26,577 --> 01:16:28,238
Oh, God.

1048
01:16:28,745 --> 01:16:32,078
It's an Academy Award performance.

1049
01:16:33,784 --> 01:16:37,277
He is a great actor. God!

1050
01:16:39,224 --> 01:16:40,885
I'm going to write that, Jack.

1051
01:16:41,092 --> 01:16:44,584
I'm so pleased, Hedda.
I'm so truly pleased.

1052
01:16:45,296 --> 01:16:48,858
Now, is he really as difficult...

1053
01:16:49,068 --> 01:16:50,933
...as everyone says he is?

1054
01:16:51,170 --> 01:16:54,264
- Difficult? Jimmy?
- Yes, everyone says it.

1055
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:56,335
Hedda, he's like a son to me.

1056
01:16:56,709 --> 01:16:58,734
Oh, come on, Jack.

1057
01:16:58,944 --> 01:17:00,344
Come on.

1058
01:17:01,014 --> 01:17:03,107
He is a teensy bit difficult.

1059
01:17:03,316 --> 01:17:05,648
But you mustn't write that.

1060
01:17:05,852 --> 01:17:07,843
You have to promise me
that you will not write that.

1061
01:17:08,054 --> 01:17:09,351
Please.

1062
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:11,618
All right.

1063
01:17:12,193 --> 01:17:13,785
You'll owe me one.

1064
01:17:15,696 --> 01:17:17,254
Nothing for nothing, huh?

1065
01:17:17,465 --> 01:17:18,693
- Yeah.
- It's a deal.

1066
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,334
- Great. You know what I'm gonna write?
- What?

1067
01:17:21,536 --> 01:17:25,974
I'm going to write
that he is America's...

1068
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:29,373
...new...

1069
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:32,302
...free spirit.

1070
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,810
Hedda, Hedda, listen.

1071
01:17:36,018 --> 01:17:40,251
Write he's America's newest rebel.

1072
01:17:41,424 --> 01:17:43,051
- Rebel?
- Yes, he's a rebel.

1073
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,227
Like us.

1074
01:17:45,895 --> 01:17:48,887
I don't care about reviews
or about grosses.

1075
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,995
There's gonna be no more crap
like you pulled on me in New York.

1076
01:17:53,938 --> 01:17:54,996
Shut up!

1077
01:17:57,775 --> 01:17:59,766
Bernie Plotkin gave me this.

1078
01:18:00,144 --> 01:18:01,270
"Question:

1079
01:18:02,714 --> 01:18:04,739
Are you a homosexual, Mr. Dean?

1080
01:18:04,950 --> 01:18:07,646
Answer: No, I'm not a homosexual...

1081
01:18:07,852 --> 01:18:10,582
...but I won't go through life
with one hand tied behind my back. "

1082
01:18:10,789 --> 01:18:13,019
Did you say that?
You said that to a fan magazine?

1083
01:18:14,326 --> 01:18:15,316
It's true.

1084
01:18:15,728 --> 01:18:18,720
"It's true. " What are you,
a crazy person?

1085
01:18:19,232 --> 01:18:22,065
You think homosexuals
sell tickets to teenagers?

1086
01:18:22,268 --> 01:18:25,066
I don't want you saying
any more crazy things to magazines.

1087
01:18:25,705 --> 01:18:28,607
You say,
because I'm making you a star...

1088
01:18:28,809 --> 01:18:31,869
...you say, "Thank you, Mr. Warner.
Thank you. "

1089
01:18:32,079 --> 01:18:34,809
You sided with Pier's mother against me.

1090
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:38,950
You should kiss my ass for that.
You'd be miserable with Pier Angeli.

1091
01:18:39,152 --> 01:18:42,748
Her mother would cut your balls off
and plant them on Mussolini's grave.

1092
01:18:42,991 --> 01:18:45,653
Let me tell you something.
Pier Angeli's gone.

1093
01:18:45,994 --> 01:18:47,325
She is really gone.

1094
01:18:47,662 --> 01:18:49,892
She's married. Forget her!

1095
01:18:52,233 --> 01:18:54,725
You got such a wonderful talent...

1096
01:18:56,905 --> 01:18:59,669
...and a wonderful career
ahead of you.

1097
01:19:00,776 --> 01:19:02,573
You should learn to trust me.

1098
01:19:04,613 --> 01:19:05,945
You're like a son to me.

1099
01:19:08,251 --> 01:19:09,343
What's funny?

1100
01:19:10,787 --> 01:19:12,345
You just gotta trust me too.

1101
01:19:12,722 --> 01:19:14,553
Of course I trust you.

1102
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,691
Oh, you gonna light my cigar?

1103
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:25,458
Smells good, huh?
You want to try it?

1104
01:19:52,632 --> 01:19:54,759
All right, everybody, he's coming.
Roll sound!

1105
01:19:54,967 --> 01:19:56,765
76, take one.

1106
01:20:01,008 --> 01:20:03,238
Shh! We're rolling!

1107
01:20:07,247 --> 01:20:08,237
All right, Jimmy.

1108
01:20:13,955 --> 01:20:17,686
Stop! You're killing him!
You want to kill your own father?

1109
01:20:20,663 --> 01:20:21,925
And cut!

1110
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:26,733
Jimmy.

1111
01:20:26,936 --> 01:20:28,961
Jimmy, it's over. It's over, Jimmy!

1112
01:20:35,645 --> 01:20:37,078
How you doing, son?

1113
01:20:39,649 --> 01:20:42,049
It's got 200 horsepower...

1114
01:20:42,152 --> 01:20:44,347
...1300cc engine.

1115
01:20:44,721 --> 01:20:47,657
Right here, dual Solex carbs.

1116
01:20:47,859 --> 01:20:51,989
Whole body's made of aluminum
so it weighs about 1100 pounds.

1117
01:20:52,330 --> 01:20:55,026
- Watch it, man.
- Oh, sorry.

1118
01:20:57,068 --> 01:21:00,232
You know that
car racing is for idiots.

1119
01:21:01,974 --> 01:21:04,807
Well, you're working for me.

1120
01:21:05,010 --> 01:21:07,535
And I say no racing cars.

1121
01:21:09,014 --> 01:21:10,778
You find that funny, huh?

1122
01:21:10,984 --> 01:21:12,952
We're signing a deal that
will pay you a million dollars.

1123
01:21:13,153 --> 01:21:17,089
And for a million dollars,
I'm telling you, no more racing cars.

1124
01:21:17,924 --> 01:21:21,018
- While I'm shooting.
- I beg your pardon?

1125
01:21:22,095 --> 01:21:25,088
When I'm not shooting,
I'm on my own, Jack.

1126
01:21:26,667 --> 01:21:29,158
If you don't like that,
you can take your million bucks-

1127
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:30,928
You're gonna say something
you're gonna regret.

1128
01:21:32,106 --> 01:21:33,095
Smile, Jack.

1129
01:21:33,808 --> 01:21:34,968
Why?

1130
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:42,249
Get rid of it.

1131
01:21:44,052 --> 01:21:46,885
Ladies and gentlemen,
could I have your attention please?

1132
01:21:47,088 --> 01:21:48,078
Please gather round.

1133
01:21:48,291 --> 01:21:49,952
Everybody, come on in.

1134
01:21:50,326 --> 01:21:53,989
We're here today to celebrate
a great new Warner's movie star...

1135
01:21:54,197 --> 01:21:55,221
...James Dean.

1136
01:21:55,598 --> 01:21:57,259
Jimmy, come on up.

1137
01:22:01,538 --> 01:22:03,597
James Dean, who drives me crazy...

1138
01:22:03,807 --> 01:22:06,970
...and a million-dollar contract
which proves me crazy.

1139
01:22:07,978 --> 01:22:10,708
When the cork pops, the deal is done.

1140
01:22:11,582 --> 01:22:14,984
All right, but no deal
unless I get the cork out.

1141
01:22:15,220 --> 01:22:17,882
Right. Watch out,
everybody, you know he's crazy.

1142
01:22:26,232 --> 01:22:27,824
Oh, you're crazy.

1143
01:22:28,067 --> 01:22:29,056
You are nuts.

1144
01:22:29,268 --> 01:22:31,202
Oh, you sweetheart.

1145
01:22:32,004 --> 01:22:33,232
I love you and I hate you.

1146
01:22:33,606 --> 01:22:36,336
I hate you and I hate you.

1147
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,642
When I started shooting Giant...

1148
01:22:46,186 --> 01:22:49,883
...nothing went right between
the director, George Stevens, and me.

1149
01:22:50,223 --> 01:22:52,749
Maybe it was because I missed Pier.

1150
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:56,794
Or maybe it was because
Stevens reminded me of my father.

1151
01:23:02,970 --> 01:23:04,666
Where the hell is he?

1152
01:23:04,873 --> 01:23:06,841
I'm sorry, Mr. Stevens,
but he won't come to the set.

1153
01:23:06,975 --> 01:23:08,875
He said you kept him
waiting too long between takes.

1154
01:23:09,044 --> 01:23:12,036
- What?
- He says he's done for the day.

1155
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,050
Come on, we'll take care of it.

1156
01:23:24,060 --> 01:23:26,392
Jim, we're ready to shoot.

1157
01:23:28,131 --> 01:23:29,565
Not me.

1158
01:23:29,900 --> 01:23:30,924
Not today.

1159
01:23:31,135 --> 01:23:33,069
Come on, son, let's go.

1160
01:23:33,337 --> 01:23:37,068
The well's rigged, we're losing the light.
Let's get out on the set.

1161
01:23:40,177 --> 01:23:43,011
You keep me waiting hours
preparing for a scene...

1162
01:23:43,214 --> 01:23:45,045
...you never get around to shooting.

1163
01:23:46,051 --> 01:23:47,382
I ain't working today.

1164
01:23:48,086 --> 01:23:52,079
And you do it again, I'm gonna
take two days. And then three.

1165
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:58,920
All right. Put Dean's clothes on
his stand-in. We'll shoot it without him.

1166
01:24:01,834 --> 01:24:02,823
Come on!

1167
01:24:03,035 --> 01:24:04,332
Come on!

1168
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:08,672
You can push that mug Rock Hudson
around, but not me!

1169
01:24:08,942 --> 01:24:12,070
You don't know what acting is,
you stupid son of a bitch!

1170
01:24:12,279 --> 01:24:13,610
Come on, old man!

1171
01:24:14,281 --> 01:24:16,681
I guess that's a wrap for today.

1172
01:24:53,623 --> 01:24:55,648
Is that you?

1173
01:24:56,060 --> 01:24:58,187
- I need to talk to you.
- Ethel's waiting for me.

1174
01:24:58,562 --> 01:24:59,756
Why don't you let her wait?

1175
01:24:59,964 --> 01:25:02,956
Hold on, young man.
Don't take that attitude with me.

1176
01:25:03,167 --> 01:25:05,795
- I need to talk to you!
- I don't have to talk to you-

1177
01:25:06,003 --> 01:25:07,766
Everybody thinks I'm great except you!

1178
01:25:07,972 --> 01:25:09,668
- Fine, listen to them.
- Don't you read the papers?

1179
01:25:09,875 --> 01:25:13,936
I'm in the papers! Everybody wants
to meet me except you. Why?

1180
01:25:14,146 --> 01:25:15,977
- every stupid mistake
you've ever made.

1181
01:25:16,181 --> 01:25:18,115
Shut up! Listen to me!

1182
01:25:18,316 --> 01:25:20,807
Why don't you talk to me?
You're my father!

1183
01:25:21,019 --> 01:25:23,079
- Please!
- I deserve some damn respect.

1184
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:25,280
Dad, I was 9 years old!

1185
01:25:25,658 --> 01:25:29,287
9 years old! Now open
your mouth and talk to me!

1186
01:25:29,662 --> 01:25:33,895
You talk to me! Dad, please. Please!

1187
01:25:34,101 --> 01:25:35,659
- Hey, Winton.
- Talk to me, please!

1188
01:25:35,869 --> 01:25:37,598
What's going on here?

1189
01:25:37,805 --> 01:25:39,705
This is my father.
Now get in your house!

1190
01:25:39,907 --> 01:25:42,637
- Is this your son?
- Yeah, this is my boy.

1191
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:48,843
- You two all right?
- We'll be fine. We'll be fine.

1192
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:51,985
Winton, you shouldn't be fighting
with him out here in public.

1193
01:25:52,187 --> 01:25:53,984
I understand.

1194
01:25:56,291 --> 01:26:00,228
Now, where do you want to go?
We gotta go somewhere else.

1195
01:26:01,030 --> 01:26:02,895
- Okay?
- All right.

1196
01:26:08,738 --> 01:26:10,569
Beautiful view.

1197
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:18,537
This is where my house is gonna be.

1198
01:26:19,149 --> 01:26:21,845
And I own that land over there too.

1199
01:26:22,052 --> 01:26:23,542
Nice car.

1200
01:26:24,989 --> 01:26:28,720
Yeah, it's aluminum.
They only made 30.

1201
01:26:28,926 --> 01:26:30,951
That must have cost a lot.

1202
01:26:31,863 --> 01:26:33,694
I got a lot.

1203
01:26:34,198 --> 01:26:38,602
Yeah, this town is yours, isn't it?

1204
01:26:39,271 --> 01:26:41,637
I'm doing pretty good.

1205
01:26:43,876 --> 01:26:46,071
You like L.A., Father?

1206
01:26:47,646 --> 01:26:49,274
Do I like L.A.?

1207
01:26:51,918 --> 01:26:55,285
Well, I'll tell you something,
young man.

1208
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:58,316
If I could find the edge
of this town...

1209
01:26:58,525 --> 01:27:00,117
...I'd leave it.

1210
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:03,891
But you're the edge of this town now.

1211
01:27:04,698 --> 01:27:07,531
And you are everywhere.

1212
01:27:10,938 --> 01:27:13,202
Why'd you do it, Father? Why-

1213
01:27:14,276 --> 01:27:17,006
Why'd you send me away?

1214
01:27:17,212 --> 01:27:19,874
Why didn't you come
to Mother's funeral?

1215
01:27:21,550 --> 01:27:24,951
- Just talk to me.
- But I don't have to talk to you.

1216
01:27:25,153 --> 01:27:26,211
You're my father.

1217
01:27:26,589 --> 01:27:29,114
No, I'm not. I'm not your father.

1218
01:27:29,325 --> 01:27:32,123
And your mother told me that.

1219
01:27:34,931 --> 01:27:38,799
Your mother, my wife,
told me that I'm not-

1220
01:27:40,904 --> 01:27:43,998
Well, I might not be your dad.

1221
01:27:46,009 --> 01:27:49,570
Told me just before she died.

1222
01:27:49,813 --> 01:27:53,807
She wanted to set
things straight, I guess.

1223
01:27:54,586 --> 01:27:58,682
When she was 18,
she started seeing this other guy.

1224
01:28:00,091 --> 01:28:02,992
He was married with kids...

1225
01:28:04,062 --> 01:28:07,726
...and she just couldn't
break it off, I guess.

1226
01:28:09,101 --> 01:28:11,865
A couple of weeks
after we were married...

1227
01:28:12,071 --> 01:28:14,505
...she found out that
she was pregnant with you.

1228
01:28:16,575 --> 01:28:20,068
And not knowing, I was
the happiest man alive...

1229
01:28:20,447 --> 01:28:22,677
...for about nine years.

1230
01:28:22,916 --> 01:28:25,680
But then, she just had
to tell me the truth.

1231
01:28:31,125 --> 01:28:34,925
And I just couldn't live with that.

1232
01:28:40,935 --> 01:28:45,498
Yeah, you know,
your mother was brave.

1233
01:28:46,942 --> 01:28:49,604
Telling me the truth like she did.

1234
01:28:50,445 --> 01:28:52,106
And I was...

1235
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,985
...too prideful.

1236
01:28:57,787 --> 01:29:01,985
I couldn't find the damn courage...

1237
01:29:02,191 --> 01:29:04,455
...to forgive her.

1238
01:29:05,561 --> 01:29:08,554
And so I got cheated
out of my wife...

1239
01:29:09,867 --> 01:29:12,529
...and I cheated myself...

1240
01:29:12,803 --> 01:29:16,170
...out of having you as my son.

1241
01:29:17,808 --> 01:29:19,674
And I'm proud of you, Jim.

1242
01:29:23,848 --> 01:29:28,148
And I'm sorry that I acted so bad
to you all these years.

1243
01:30:02,857 --> 01:30:03,846
Mr. Stevens?

1244
01:30:05,793 --> 01:30:07,192
Ready to go to work, sir.

1245
01:30:09,030 --> 01:30:10,123
Good, son.

1246
01:30:11,633 --> 01:30:12,622
Good.

1247
01:30:24,114 --> 01:30:25,945
Ready? Let's go!

1248
01:30:26,449 --> 01:30:28,212
Let's go for picture, everybody!

1249
01:30:28,585 --> 01:30:31,816
Now, that's picture.
Here we go. Make it happen.

1250
01:30:32,689 --> 01:30:33,815
Effects, ready?

1251
01:30:34,825 --> 01:30:35,849
Ready!

1252
01:30:36,060 --> 01:30:37,550
Sound, ready?

1253
01:30:37,762 --> 01:30:38,660
Ready!

1254
01:30:38,796 --> 01:30:40,991
- Camera, ready?
- Ready!

1255
01:30:45,036 --> 01:30:46,799
Let's roll!

1256
01:30:47,639 --> 01:30:48,503
Speed!

1257
01:30:48,707 --> 01:30:51,073
Scene 253, take one!

1258
01:30:52,110 --> 01:30:53,839
And action!

1259
01:31:01,654 --> 01:31:02,814
Blow!

1260
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:33,587
Looks good.

1261
01:31:34,622 --> 01:31:37,022
Weird thing to name a car, man.

1262
01:31:37,225 --> 01:31:38,750
I don't know.

1263
01:31:39,428 --> 01:31:40,656
Maybe.

1264
01:31:47,603 --> 01:31:50,095
My mechanic, Rolf Wutherich,
and I decided...

1265
01:31:50,307 --> 01:31:52,867
...to drive my car
to a race in Salinas.

1266
01:31:53,643 --> 01:31:55,975
It was a beautiful, clear day.

1267
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:59,706
The road seemed almost deserted.

1268
01:32:04,989 --> 01:32:06,752
You got it.

1269
01:32:11,629 --> 01:32:13,995
See that piece on you
in the L.A. Times?

1270
01:32:14,599 --> 01:32:15,760
No, why? I get hammered?

1271
01:32:16,735 --> 01:32:20,865
Opposite. They said you're gonna get
bigger than Brando and Clift together.

1272
01:32:21,073 --> 01:32:22,700
Can you believe it?

1273
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:34,844
Watch that Ford.

1274
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:41,850
He's turning left.

1275
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,927
He's gotta see us.

1276
01:33:24,441 --> 01:33:26,602
There's been a terrible accident.

1277
01:33:32,717 --> 01:33:35,880
I took the train ride
back to Indiana again.

1278
01:33:36,588 --> 01:33:39,113
This time my father came with me.
