1
00:02:14,473 --> 00:02:17,045
Mom?

2
00:02:17,149 --> 00:02:19,548
Mom!

3
00:02:19,652 --> 00:02:21,041
We're gonna have to go, hun.

4
00:02:21,147 --> 00:02:22,258
We have to get to safety, OK?

5
00:02:22,363 --> 00:02:23,363
Go!

6
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:30,670
Mom, mom, I'm scared!

7
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:31,774
Come on!

8
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:45,163
Oh no, not the cellar.

9
00:02:48,187 --> 00:02:49,752
Run to the thresher, babe.

10
00:03:13,351 --> 00:03:14,394
Run!

11
00:03:14,498 --> 00:03:15,498
Run!

12
00:03:23,605 --> 00:03:25,134
Mom, come on!

13
00:03:53,356 --> 00:03:54,886
I love you!

14
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:01,726
Mom!

15
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:05,444
Mom!

16
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:18,451
The boy and his mother are
running from a tornado,

17
00:04:18,556 --> 00:04:20,711
and they come to a wheat thresher.

18
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:23,108
Then the mother gets sucked up into the air.

19
00:04:23,213 --> 00:04:25,681
And the boy grabs on,
but he's not strong enough,

20
00:04:25,785 --> 00:04:27,001
and he lets her go.

21
00:04:27,105 --> 00:04:29,226
She flies up into the air.

22
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:31,868
He never saw his mother again.

23
00:04:53,313 --> 00:04:56,337
Thanks again for working on a Saturday,
Stacy.

24
00:04:56,441 --> 00:05:00,055
I don't think it's going
to be a permanent thing.

25
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:01,159
Stacy?

26
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,095
Stacy.

27
00:05:09,474 --> 00:05:10,474
Oh.

28
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,608
I'm not in the mood to
explain why Jake still

29
00:05:17,712 --> 00:05:18,825
has sleepovers at his age.

30
00:05:25,671 --> 00:05:27,236
I had a great time last night.

31
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,591
Me too.

32
00:05:28,695 --> 00:05:30,502
So, are you going to call me?

33
00:05:30,607 --> 00:05:31,607
Of course.

34
00:05:31,685 --> 00:05:34,708
You didn't call Louisa.

35
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:36,028
Louisa?

36
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:36,884
Well...

37
00:05:36,899 --> 00:05:38,740
It's OK move on you know.

38
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:40,477
Yeah.

39
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,180
That's what I was doing last night.

40
00:06:09,395 --> 00:06:11,550
It was a story, mom, just a story.

41
00:06:11,655 --> 00:06:13,183
I don't see what the big deal is.

42
00:06:13,288 --> 00:06:15,409
The big deal is that you're
the only one who seems

43
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,737
to think it has a happy ending.

44
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,545
It wasn't a happy ending.

45
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:22,395
It was just scary.

46
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:23,499
It was fun to tell.

47
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:30,389
Campbell, honey,
I know that you are angry about the move

48
00:06:30,493 --> 00:06:31,242
here.

49
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,787
I'm not angry.

50
00:06:32,891 --> 00:06:34,630
It's not my story.

51
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:36,054
Jake told it to me.

52
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:37,584
Jake?

53
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:39,251
Did Jake?

54
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,398
Jake told you that story?

55
00:06:40,504 --> 00:06:41,511
Uh-huh.

56
00:06:46,308 --> 00:06:49,853
Hey,
did you see that girl he had over last night?

57
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,173
She was so hot.

58
00:06:59,237 --> 00:07:01,496
OK, gotta go.

59
00:07:01,601 --> 00:07:04,729
Stacy, here is some cash if you want

60
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,850
to take him out for dinner.

61
00:07:06,954 --> 00:07:07,946
No.

62
00:07:07,961 --> 00:07:10,707
Can we order in and play some games?

63
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:13,383
Uh, yeah.

64
00:07:13,488 --> 00:07:15,017
Give me a kiss.

65
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,990
There he is.

66
00:07:30,031 --> 00:07:31,491
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Campbell.

67
00:07:31,596 --> 00:07:35,036
He's got a free lane.

68
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:35,926
Yeah!

69
00:07:35,941 --> 00:07:36,941
I can't even do that.

70
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:39,416
Trying to make me lift that.

71
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,935
Campbell, I need to talk to Jake.

72
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,151
Mom.

73
00:07:45,255 --> 00:07:46,924
Come on, just for a minute.

74
00:07:47,027 --> 00:07:48,592
You can play with him all day.

75
00:07:48,697 --> 00:07:49,697
All day?

76
00:07:56,482 --> 00:07:57,440
Hi.

77
00:07:57,455 --> 00:07:58,497
Can I talk to you?

78
00:07:58,602 --> 00:07:59,561
Yeah, sure.

79
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,104
What's up?

80
00:08:01,209 --> 00:08:03,224
That story that you told Campbell

81
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:06,771
about the mother being killed
in front of her little boy.

82
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,952
Yeah.

83
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,620
Not a good story?

84
00:08:09,725 --> 00:08:12,226
Not a good story, no.

85
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:16,780
Campbell, come inside and help me clean up.

86
00:08:16,884 --> 00:08:19,247
His father just left us, and we've

87
00:08:19,351 --> 00:08:22,307
just moved here, and Campbell...

88
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:24,739
well, he doesn't need to be scared right now,
Jake.

89
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:25,767
I know, Corrine.

90
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:26,999
I'm sorry.

91
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:29,814
I didn't... I didn't even think about that.

92
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,027
Well, he likes you,
and I'm glad he likes you,

93
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:36,055
and I like you too.

94
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,495
Just be careful.

95
00:08:41,631 --> 00:08:43,926
And there's one more thing.

96
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,072
Oh no.

97
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:46,810
Now, I wasn't even going to mention this,

98
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:52,476
because really,
it's none of my business, but the women.

99
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,727
The women?

100
00:08:53,831 --> 00:08:55,291
Campbell is 12, and when he sees

101
00:08:55,395 --> 00:08:56,890
these women coming and going...

102
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,871
Now, Corrine, you know, that is not fair.

103
00:08:58,975 --> 00:09:02,208
Coming and going...
there's been two women in two months,

104
00:09:02,312 --> 00:09:03,598
all right?

105
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,092
It's not like I'm sleeping
with the whole town.

106
00:09:05,196 --> 00:09:06,413
I know.

107
00:09:06,517 --> 00:09:07,594
And I know that you're just trying

108
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:08,658
to move on with your life.

109
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,631
Yes, yes, that's right.

110
00:09:09,646 --> 00:09:10,897
I am.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,844
I'm trying to move on with my life no less.

112
00:09:12,948 --> 00:09:16,875
Man, this town talks.

113
00:09:16,979 --> 00:09:18,369
I'm sorry.

114
00:09:18,473 --> 00:09:21,323
I am out of line,
and this is none of my business.

115
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:24,139
No.

116
00:09:24,243 --> 00:09:25,634
Listen, I don't want to give Campbell

117
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:28,101
the wrong impression about
that sort of thing either.

118
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:31,298
Believe me, I don't.

119
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,044
I'll tell you what, I make this,

120
00:09:34,148 --> 00:09:36,165
and you start sleeping at their house.

121
00:09:36,269 --> 00:09:37,276
What, from right here?

122
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:38,772
- Yeah.
- All right.

123
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:40,266
I think that's an
excellent way to handle it.

124
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,421
We can play horse to see
what college he goes to too.

125
00:09:48,538 --> 00:09:52,709
Yeah, yeah, but can you dunk?

126
00:09:52,813 --> 00:09:55,663
I don't want you to change, Jake.

127
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:58,062
But just keep in mind that
Campbell looks up to you.

128
00:10:01,398 --> 00:10:03,971
It was a lucky shot, wasn't it, Corrine?

129
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:06,055
Don't forget to take your toothbrush.

130
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:26,354
Sheriff, we got weather reports coming in.

131
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:27,953
Looks like tornado weather.

132
00:10:28,056 --> 00:10:30,282
Rollins, I want you to find Jake.

133
00:10:30,386 --> 00:10:32,263
We need all the manpower we can get.

134
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:36,885
What?

135
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,187
Well, Sheriff, why Jake?

136
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,438
I mean, why not Carter?

137
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,037
If you want to fire Jake, just fire him,

138
00:10:43,141 --> 00:10:44,428
but don't keep punishing him.

139
00:10:44,532 --> 00:10:45,679
Punishing him?

140
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:48,737
He's doing that all by himself.

141
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,788
You're not going to find him standing there,
deputy.

142
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,577
Don't think I didn't see that.

143
00:11:21,131 --> 00:11:22,800
Good morning, Miss Maguire.

144
00:11:22,904 --> 00:11:24,399
Hi, Stu.

145
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:25,650
How's your little girl doing?

146
00:11:25,754 --> 00:11:26,761
Oh, she's doing well.

147
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:27,909
Thanks for asking.

148
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:30,515
She got right back on her bike,
cast and all.

149
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,852
You should see her try to pedal
when she can't bend her knee.

150
00:11:33,956 --> 00:11:36,250
No points for style, but she's got guts.

151
00:11:36,355 --> 00:11:37,466
She takes after her father.

152
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,892
Oh, no.

153
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:41,290
When I was laid up,
I just sat in front of the TV.

154
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:44,383
Rang that cowbell every
time I wanted another beer,

155
00:11:44,487 --> 00:11:45,913
drove my wife crazy.

156
00:11:46,017 --> 00:11:47,859
It was a damn good month.

157
00:11:47,964 --> 00:11:50,257
Good times.

158
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:51,718
You have a good day, Miss Maguire.

159
00:11:51,822 --> 00:11:52,822
You too, Stu.

160
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:22,844
Good morning.

161
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:24,945
Morning.

162
00:12:25,048 --> 00:12:26,048
Hi, Corrine.

163
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:26,947
Hi, Manuel.

164
00:12:26,962 --> 00:12:28,177
Neville and Potter here yet?

165
00:12:28,281 --> 00:12:29,289
Neville's around.

166
00:12:29,393 --> 00:12:31,723
Potter's giving us first tour, Boy Scouts.

167
00:12:31,827 --> 00:12:33,669
Oh no, they're going to eat him alive.

168
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:34,696
Potter?

169
00:12:34,711 --> 00:12:36,310
He's a grown man.

170
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:38,117
You don't understand, Manuel.

171
00:12:38,221 --> 00:12:40,864
12-year-olds can smell fear.

172
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:41,968
What's a meltdown?

173
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:48,614
The term meltdown refers to
the fuel rods in the reactor,

174
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:50,491
that they overheat and melt. But we

175
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:54,175
have backup system after backup
system so that doesn't happen.

176
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:59,250
And even if it does,
which it won't, but if it does,

177
00:12:59,354 --> 00:13:03,072
the reactor is in containment,
which means just that.

178
00:13:03,178 --> 00:13:05,298
We can seal it up like a tomb.

179
00:13:05,402 --> 00:13:09,051
Nothing gets in,
nothing gets out, ever again.

180
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:11,101
If the fuel rods are in
the containment room,

181
00:13:11,206 --> 00:13:14,717
then what are those?

182
00:13:14,821 --> 00:13:16,976
Those are used fuel rods.

183
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,783
This is where we store
them after they've done

184
00:13:18,888 --> 00:13:20,486
all their hard work for us.

185
00:13:24,519 --> 00:13:27,890
See,
the fuel rods are still hot and radioactive.

186
00:13:27,994 --> 00:13:29,593
People think radiation is man-made.

187
00:13:29,697 --> 00:13:31,052
It's not.

188
00:13:31,157 --> 00:13:33,416
It's as powerful as the sun,
but if you just left these things

189
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:37,518
out, exposed, I mean, sunblock don't help

190
00:13:37,622 --> 00:13:38,615
if you don't have any skin.

191
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,673
Know what I mean?

192
00:13:42,627 --> 00:13:44,121
Anyway, so this is where we store

193
00:13:44,226 --> 00:13:48,709
them before we can move them
to safe and protective story...

194
00:13:48,814 --> 00:13:49,772
storage.

195
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:52,602
How long is that?

196
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,958
About 20 years.

197
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,696
How long do they have to be
in the protective storage

198
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,877
you take them to?

199
00:13:56,982 --> 00:14:04,871
About, uh, 300,000 to 400,000 years.

200
00:14:04,976 --> 00:14:07,756
OK, well that about wraps up our tour.

201
00:14:07,861 --> 00:14:10,919
Shelly here will be glad
to show you out and explain

202
00:14:11,022 --> 00:14:13,212
to you on the way how nuclear power

203
00:14:13,317 --> 00:14:15,820
gets safer and safer every day.

204
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,574
Well done.

205
00:14:19,678 --> 00:14:21,103
Well done.

206
00:14:21,207 --> 00:14:22,737
Only a few of them were in tears.

207
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:23,625
Come on.

208
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:25,030
No one was in tears.

209
00:14:25,134 --> 00:14:26,421
A little hint...

210
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:32,016
the key to planned tours with
kids is evading questions.

211
00:14:36,987 --> 00:14:37,980
What were you doing?

212
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:39,350
Were you checking up on me?

213
00:14:39,454 --> 00:14:41,297
I thought you hated those tours.

214
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,324
Corrine sent me out.

215
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:43,799
She didn't trust you.

216
00:14:43,903 --> 00:14:45,606
Why did they bring in someone for that job,
man?

217
00:14:45,711 --> 00:14:46,753
That should've been yours.

218
00:14:46,858 --> 00:14:47,858
That wasn't fair.

219
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,325
It's called affirmative action, Potter.

220
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,890
They wanted a woman for the job.

221
00:14:54,052 --> 00:14:55,052
Corrine.

222
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,988
It's time to start our shift.

223
00:15:04,723 --> 00:15:05,723
Have a good one.

224
00:15:19,146 --> 00:15:21,580
You know something about women, right Jake?

225
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:23,005
Less and less every year.

226
00:15:23,109 --> 00:15:24,109
Why?

227
00:15:27,871 --> 00:15:30,755
No, not the babysitter.

228
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,972
No. No.

229
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:33,223
Nothing good can come from that.

230
00:15:33,328 --> 00:15:34,405
You hear me, all right?

231
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,692
She's just a little too old for you.

232
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:37,603
I'm not a kid.

233
00:15:37,707 --> 00:15:38,924
There's an old saying in the south.

234
00:15:39,028 --> 00:15:41,009
You're not a man until your father says so.

235
00:15:43,824 --> 00:15:46,257
I never did believe that though, all right?

236
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:48,099
So just be patient.

237
00:15:48,204 --> 00:15:49,247
You're going to have to grow older

238
00:15:49,351 --> 00:15:50,532
whether you like it or not.

239
00:15:50,637 --> 00:15:52,165
Mom says you haven't.

240
00:16:07,111 --> 00:16:10,309
Rollins, any sign of Jake?

241
00:16:10,413 --> 00:16:11,421
No.

242
00:16:11,526 --> 00:16:13,298
We've just been upgraded to tornado watch.

243
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,744
You cannot possibly be checking

244
00:17:09,848 --> 00:17:10,856
those systems that fast.

245
00:17:23,646 --> 00:17:24,793
- Hey.
- Hey.

246
00:17:24,898 --> 00:17:26,323
- Hey now.
- How's it going?

247
00:17:26,427 --> 00:17:27,504
Oh, I see.

248
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:28,687
You want to be handcuffed again, don't you?

249
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,445
This is not a coincidence.

250
00:17:37,549 --> 00:17:40,016
Every girl he dates is a girl who hates me.

251
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:41,964
Nobody hates you.

252
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:44,536
Gloria hates me.

253
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,787
That's really nice.

254
00:17:45,891 --> 00:17:48,184
OK, Gloria hates you.

255
00:17:48,288 --> 00:17:49,610
But he's angry.

256
00:17:49,714 --> 00:17:50,637
You dumped him.

257
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:54,024
Let him get it out.

258
00:17:54,128 --> 00:17:56,143
You're just all kinds of naughty,
aren't you?

259
00:17:56,248 --> 00:17:57,534
Hey, Gloria?

260
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:58,890
Hey, Ashley.

261
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,393
Can I talk to you, like now?

262
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:07,544
What are you doing?

263
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:09,074
Are you a child?

264
00:18:09,178 --> 00:18:11,506
You're targeting the woman
that pisses me off the most.

265
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:13,488
She just came over to talk to me.

266
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,052
I just worked out.

267
00:18:15,156 --> 00:18:17,206
My pheromones happen to be
projecting very far right now.

268
00:18:17,311 --> 00:18:18,667
Don't make me start swinging.

269
00:18:18,771 --> 00:18:19,953
Just wait.

270
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:22,455
First of all, the women who, let's say,

271
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,297
aren't that fond of you are the only ones

272
00:18:24,401 --> 00:18:26,418
that will talk to me, OK?

273
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,406
And second, no.

274
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:31,039
No second. No.

275
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,102
No first of all either.

276
00:18:32,117 --> 00:18:33,125
I take it back. What do you care?

277
00:18:33,229 --> 00:18:34,084
You dumped me.

278
00:18:34,099 --> 00:18:35,489
You broke off the engagement.

279
00:18:35,593 --> 00:18:37,435
Because when you get engaged,
Jake, there's something

280
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,068
called setting a date.

281
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:41,015
And not setting a date for like eight months

282
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,892
is going to convince me that
you want to get married.

283
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,317
Ashley, we set a date.

284
00:18:44,422 --> 00:18:45,812
It was going to be June.

285
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,723
June of what year, Jake?

286
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:49,844
You're supposed to be
specific about what year.

287
00:18:49,948 --> 00:18:53,040
Please, please, just keep it down please.

288
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:53,896
What is this?

289
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:55,300
Did you call your father?

290
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:57,317
What, am I going to get
arrested for flirting in public?

291
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:59,367
Don't blame me if you get
further on your treadmill

292
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,584
than you do with your job.

293
00:19:00,688 --> 00:19:01,800
Jake, Sheriff put you on duty today.

294
00:19:01,905 --> 00:19:02,828
Why?

295
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:03,886
Carter's off too.

296
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,944
Why can't... that's right, I forgot.

297
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,273
I'm the Sheriff department whipping boy.

298
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,741
Well, everyone needs a job skill,
don't they, Jake?

299
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,928
That's nice.

300
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:20,639
I swear,
sometimes I miss driving those damn trucks.

301
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,779
Do you want to play a game or something?

302
00:19:42,883 --> 00:19:43,668
OK.

303
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,830
Can I choose?

304
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:45,934
Mm-hmm.

305
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:29,039
It's only a tornado watch right now.

306
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:30,673
Yeah, of course.

307
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,168
They don't give you a tornado
warning until your house is 50

308
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:33,272
feet from where you built it.

309
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:38,842
Where've you been?

310
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:55,266
You go.

311
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:56,281
OK.

312
00:21:15,788 --> 00:21:16,573
Hello?

313
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:17,595
Hey, sweetie.

314
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,612
It's me, just checking in.

315
00:21:19,716 --> 00:21:20,723
How are things going?

316
00:21:24,756 --> 00:21:27,119
Campbell?

317
00:21:27,223 --> 00:21:30,908
My mom just hung up on me.

318
00:21:31,011 --> 00:21:33,235
Can we start over?

319
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:34,341
OK.

320
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:38,929
Campbell?

321
00:21:42,864 --> 00:21:45,227
Is anyone else having
trouble with their phones?

322
00:21:56,071 --> 00:21:58,087
Jake, I can't contact Helman-Klein.

323
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,173
I can't tell if they got the tornado watch.

324
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,235
Telephone's down?

325
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,467
Yeah.

326
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:05,108
Cell phones won't go through the concrete.

327
00:22:05,213 --> 00:22:07,368
I've seen this kind of weather before.

328
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:09,001
Yeah.

329
00:22:09,105 --> 00:22:10,495
I'll go out there and make sure
we have some contact with them,

330
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,558
just in case.

331
00:22:11,573 --> 00:22:12,650
All right.

332
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:13,833
Here you go.

333
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,924
Nothing.

334
00:22:22,939 --> 00:22:23,939
They're all down, Corrine.

335
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:59,781
Listen, we've got a tornado touching down.

336
00:22:59,886 --> 00:23:03,569
Six miles on 129,
heading straight towards Helman-Klein.

337
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,632
Do you hear me?

338
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:06,176
Straight at Helman-Klein.

339
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,636
It's going to hit the nuclear plant.

340
00:23:19,975 --> 00:23:22,303
OK, I'm going outside to see if I

341
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:23,937
can get a signal on my cell.

342
00:23:24,041 --> 00:23:25,466
What about the satellite phone?

343
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:28,560
We only use the satellite
uplink for stage one alert.

344
00:23:28,664 --> 00:23:29,951
Neville, take over while I'm gone.

345
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,240
Look, has there been a tornado watch

346
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,805
issued or anything like that?

347
00:23:53,863 --> 00:23:55,392
I love you too.

348
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,009
Now what the hell's going on?

349
00:25:18,114 --> 00:25:21,033
Something happened to the power.

350
00:25:21,138 --> 00:25:26,803
The transformer just got hit by a tornado,
and Stu's dead.

351
00:25:29,758 --> 00:25:32,712
He's dead?

352
00:25:32,816 --> 00:25:33,816
Yeah.

353
00:25:37,195 --> 00:25:39,002
We're losing power, Corrine.

354
00:25:39,106 --> 00:25:40,289
Where's the backup?

355
00:25:40,393 --> 00:25:44,356
The backup system should be initiating.

356
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,954
Why are we browning out, Gail?

357
00:25:46,058 --> 00:25:47,901
Where's the backup?

358
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,430
I don't know.

359
00:25:49,534 --> 00:25:50,959
Only one of the backup
generators is working.

360
00:25:51,063 --> 00:25:54,087
Generator A is right
next to the transformers.

361
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:57,041
If they went,
there's a good chance it went too.

362
00:25:57,146 --> 00:25:59,440
OK.

363
00:25:59,544 --> 00:26:00,502
OK.

364
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,324
Are we in control of the systems?

365
00:26:02,429 --> 00:26:04,340
Negative.

366
00:26:04,445 --> 00:26:07,538
Well, are the instruments working at least?

367
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:10,005
They're on the same grid.

368
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,431
OK.

369
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:16,506
We need to find a way to
reduce power consumption.

370
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,034
We should call the NRC, Corrine.

371
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:19,668
There's a procedure for this I'm sure.

372
00:26:19,773 --> 00:26:21,301
The procedure is to call the NRC

373
00:26:21,406 --> 00:26:23,527
and evacuate all unnecessary personnel.

374
00:26:23,631 --> 00:26:27,628
On a Saturday with a skeleton crew,
that's irrelevant.

375
00:26:27,732 --> 00:26:29,992
Neville, can you cut power by, say, 50%?

376
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:31,208
Yeah.

377
00:26:31,312 --> 00:26:32,270
I can save some juice, start shutting

378
00:26:32,285 --> 00:26:33,641
down non-vital systems.

379
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:34,529
Yeah.

380
00:26:34,544 --> 00:26:35,970
OK, here it is.

381
00:26:36,073 --> 00:26:38,194
We call the NRC,
and then we get everybody out of here.

382
00:26:38,298 --> 00:26:39,445
- Yeah.
- Great.

383
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:40,473
Thanks, Potter.

384
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:41,948
Duly noted.

385
00:26:42,051 --> 00:26:43,477
Neville, I'm going to need
these instruments working ASAP.

386
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:06,992
Yes.

387
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,502
Hello, NRC.

388
00:27:08,606 --> 00:27:10,796
This is Corrine Maguire at
Helman-Klein in Bassett County,

389
00:27:10,901 --> 00:27:11,978
Tennessee.

390
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:14,620
I'm the active shift supervisor and I

391
00:27:14,724 --> 00:27:17,191
am declaring a stage one alert.

392
00:27:39,053 --> 00:27:41,000
We got a serious problem here.

393
00:27:41,103 --> 00:27:42,460
I don't know what it's like inside,

394
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:44,997
but it's a mess out here.

395
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,360
Jake,
what kind of damage are we talking about?

396
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:48,507
Is anyone hurt?

397
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:49,828
I don't know.

398
00:27:49,932 --> 00:27:51,671
I don't see Stu,
and his guard house was hit.

399
00:27:57,475 --> 00:28:01,994
Dr. Jennings,
a tornado just hit Helman-Klein in Tennessee.

400
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,523
They've declared a stage one alert.

401
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,219
Where's the review board meeting?

402
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:14,889
End of the hall.

403
00:28:28,443 --> 00:28:30,946
Ms. Maguire,
we're ready to receive the uplink.

404
00:28:31,049 --> 00:28:32,266
I'm transmitting now.

405
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,793
We're receiving

406
00:29:12,898 --> 00:29:15,051
your transmission, Ms. Maguire.

407
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:50,644
Melissa, this is Jake.

408
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,911
I'm going in to check for some more damage.

409
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,757
Hello?

410
00:30:01,836 --> 00:30:02,878
Hello?

411
00:30:07,048 --> 00:30:08,048
Are you there?

412
00:30:11,706 --> 00:30:12,706
Corrine.

413
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,275
We just lost the NRC.

414
00:30:27,138 --> 00:30:31,448
Gail,
try to get us back online with the NRC.

415
00:30:31,552 --> 00:30:33,533
Neville, we still need to reduce power.

416
00:30:33,637 --> 00:30:35,062
So shut down any of the non-vitals

417
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,166
that we still have control of.

418
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:37,948
Where the hell are you going?

419
00:30:38,051 --> 00:30:39,755
Going outside to try to
get a signal on my cell.

420
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,145
I didn't have a chance to before.

421
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,744
I should call them.

422
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:47,575
I am the shift supervisor,
Neville, and it has to be me.

423
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,679
Corrine?

424
00:30:52,128 --> 00:30:53,310
This only works locally, right?

425
00:30:53,414 --> 00:30:55,117
Just the radios inside here, yeah.

426
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:02,660
Cooling pumps.

427
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:04,119
We can shut down some of the cooling pumps.

428
00:31:04,224 --> 00:31:05,232
No.

429
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,622
Non-vitals only.

430
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:07,943
No, wait a minute.

431
00:31:08,046 --> 00:31:09,681
Wait a minute.

432
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:10,786
He's right.

433
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:12,183
We've got two systems... two.

434
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,141
They're redundant.

435
00:31:13,156 --> 00:31:14,685
The diesel pumps will be enough.

436
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:17,675
We can shut down the electric
pumps and save a lot of power.

437
00:31:17,779 --> 00:31:19,134
Go ahead.

438
00:31:19,238 --> 00:31:21,359
You want to shut down the
electric coolant pumps?

439
00:31:24,557 --> 00:31:26,050
They're redundant systems, Gail.

440
00:31:45,654 --> 00:31:47,183
Corrine, is everyone all right?

441
00:31:47,287 --> 00:31:49,268
Is anyone hurt?

442
00:31:49,373 --> 00:31:52,362
Stu's dead.

443
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:55,490
We only have partial power.

444
00:31:55,595 --> 00:31:57,541
I need to contact the NRC.

445
00:31:57,646 --> 00:31:59,627
Are all the phones down?

446
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:02,129
Yeah, some of them are.

447
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:06,438
A power relay station was hit,
but I have an emergency radio.

448
00:32:09,949 --> 00:32:13,565
The Sheriff can call for you
and hook the two of you up.

449
00:32:13,669 --> 00:32:14,990
OK.

450
00:32:15,093 --> 00:32:16,970
And I want to call Campbell
and make sure he's all right.

451
00:32:17,074 --> 00:32:18,326
He's fine, Corrine.

452
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:22,705
The tornado didn't hit town, not even close.

453
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:25,381
I can check on him if you want me to, but...

454
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:26,479
Yeah, do that.

455
00:32:26,494 --> 00:32:27,452
Thanks.

456
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,475
Anything else?

457
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,004
Yeah.

458
00:32:30,108 --> 00:32:31,742
Leave the emergency radio here,
It may be the only way

459
00:32:31,846 --> 00:32:33,062
that we can contact the NRC.

460
00:32:33,166 --> 00:32:34,349
It'll only work outside.

461
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,453
OK.

462
00:32:44,568 --> 00:32:47,591
Remember, only outside.

463
00:32:47,696 --> 00:32:50,754
I'm declaring a stage one alert.

464
00:32:50,859 --> 00:32:51,859
Tell the Sheriff.

465
00:32:51,901 --> 00:32:52,979
He'll know what that means, OK?

466
00:32:53,082 --> 00:32:56,071
A stage one alert.

467
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:59,791
How bad are we, Corrine?

468
00:32:59,895 --> 00:33:02,919
We're all right.

469
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,344
Don't worry.

470
00:33:04,448 --> 00:33:07,646
Just go back to town and
take care of things there.

471
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,331
Who's the shift supervisor at Helman-Klein?

472
00:33:33,435 --> 00:33:35,138
- Karen Maguire.
- Give me her file.

473
00:33:35,242 --> 00:33:36,200
What line is she on?

474
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,536
We just lost her.

475
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:38,823
You lost her?

476
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:40,318
Well, get her back, don't care how.

477
00:33:40,422 --> 00:33:42,263
I want a site team in the air in 30 minutes.

478
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,397
Hey, Melissa.

479
00:33:50,501 --> 00:33:52,831
Yeah, that message to the NRC from Corrine,

480
00:33:52,935 --> 00:33:55,228
a stage one alert, you know what that means?

481
00:33:55,332 --> 00:33:56,549
Let me ask the Sheriff.

482
00:33:56,653 --> 00:33:59,086
Sheriff, what does a stage one alert mean?

483
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:03,291
Stage one alert means they have a problem.

484
00:34:03,396 --> 00:34:04,474
Call the NRC.

485
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:05,968
Well, that's not anything, is it?

486
00:34:06,071 --> 00:34:09,305
Stage two,
evacuation personnel they put on standby.

487
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:13,510
Stage three, potential radiation leak,

488
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,909
total evacuation of the area.

489
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:17,924
Is there a stage four?

490
00:34:18,029 --> 00:34:21,017
Stage four?

491
00:34:21,122 --> 00:34:22,269
Stage four means boom.

492
00:34:26,788 --> 00:34:28,421
No more West Tennessee.

493
00:34:43,018 --> 00:34:44,374
What are you doing?

494
00:34:44,479 --> 00:34:46,008
This is tornado weather.

495
00:34:46,112 --> 00:34:47,070
How would you know?

496
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,789
You're from Los Angeles.

497
00:34:48,893 --> 00:34:52,299
Look, if there were tornadoes,
they'd put a warning on the TV.

498
00:34:57,443 --> 00:34:58,436
Mm-hmm.

499
00:34:58,451 --> 00:35:02,239
Go, go, run.

500
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:06,897
We've got the relay set up to Helman-Klein,
line two.

501
00:35:07,001 --> 00:35:07,959
This is Martin Jennings.

502
00:35:07,974 --> 00:35:09,156
Who am I speaking to?

503
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,581
This is Martin Jennings.

504
00:35:10,686 --> 00:35:13,605
Who am I speaking to?

505
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,996
It's Corrine Maguire.

506
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,698
Corrine, what's your situation there?

507
00:35:16,804 --> 00:35:18,784
We only have partial power.

508
00:35:18,889 --> 00:35:20,869
Backup is at 50%.

509
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:22,433
One generator down.

510
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,032
Do you have control of the facility?

511
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:25,213
Negative.

512
00:35:25,318 --> 00:35:28,237
We are only partially in control.

513
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,914
On some of the systems,
some of the instruments

514
00:35:31,018 --> 00:35:33,451
are down, frozen.

515
00:35:33,555 --> 00:35:34,877
OK, have you started the procedure?

516
00:35:34,981 --> 00:35:36,823
Have you shut down all non-vital systems?

517
00:35:36,928 --> 00:35:38,909
In the process, but we do

518
00:35:39,012 --> 00:35:43,704
not have control of some of
the systems to shut them down.

519
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,025
OK, Corrine.

520
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:46,129
We have a site team on its way, should be

521
00:35:46,207 --> 00:35:48,084
arriving in maybe three hours.

522
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,405
I don't know.

523
00:35:49,509 --> 00:35:52,602
This storm does not seem to be letting up.

524
00:35:52,707 --> 00:35:55,556
You let us worry about that.

525
00:35:55,662 --> 00:35:59,693
Martin, I'd give you all of
my worries if you'd take them.

526
00:35:59,797 --> 00:36:00,721
That's my job, Corrine.

527
00:36:00,736 --> 00:36:01,987
You know that.

528
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,343
Now listen,
we need to determine the intervals

529
00:36:03,447 --> 00:36:04,594
that will be in contact.

530
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:09,459
Well, this radio only works outside.

531
00:36:09,564 --> 00:36:14,012
We cannot communicate if
I am in the control room.

532
00:36:14,116 --> 00:36:15,116
OK.

533
00:36:15,159 --> 00:36:17,489
How about every 15 minutes then?

534
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:18,342
Fine.

535
00:36:18,357 --> 00:36:19,887
That's fine.

536
00:36:19,991 --> 00:36:21,311
15 minutes it is.

537
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:22,807
Now, so far you've done everything right.

538
00:36:22,911 --> 00:36:24,440
So until we arrive, you just keep

539
00:36:24,544 --> 00:36:25,935
doing what you're doing, OK?

540
00:36:26,038 --> 00:36:28,228
I'll speak with you in 15 minutes.

541
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:29,332
Understood.

542
00:36:49,465 --> 00:36:50,423
Hello?

543
00:36:50,438 --> 00:36:51,550
Hey, how are you?

544
00:36:51,654 --> 00:36:53,740
Daddy, I'm fine.

545
00:36:53,844 --> 00:36:55,721
Someone told you about my fight with Jake,
huh?

546
00:36:55,826 --> 00:36:57,041
I don't know anything about that.

547
00:36:57,146 --> 00:36:59,544
Then why are you calling?

548
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,038
It's getting nasty.

549
00:37:01,143 --> 00:37:02,143
A tornado hit.

550
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,611
Oh no. BISHOP: Yeah.

551
00:37:03,715 --> 00:37:05,488
Look, I think it might be a good idea,
I don't know,

552
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:09,346
for you to just get out of town.

553
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,443
You want me to do what?

554
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:11,501
Get out of town.

555
00:37:11,606 --> 00:37:13,482
Just get in a car and drive west.

556
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:15,254
Since when do you evacuate a town

557
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,358
because of tornado warnings?

558
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,401
It's just...

559
00:37:20,886 --> 00:37:22,797
What, you're not going to tell me?

560
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:24,500
All right, that's it. I'm coming over.

561
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:25,604
Ashley, no.

562
00:37:25,682 --> 00:37:26,864
You're acting crazy, OK?

563
00:37:26,968 --> 00:37:28,531
I'm coming over.

564
00:37:28,636 --> 00:37:31,173
Ashley...

565
00:37:58,979 --> 00:38:01,724
Melissa,
tell the Sheriff we've got two more.

566
00:38:06,138 --> 00:38:07,390
We've shut down everything

567
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,162
we can control from here.

568
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:10,309
Good.

569
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,875
I just talked to the NRC, and they're going

570
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:13,021
to be here in three hours.

571
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:14,515
Thank god.

572
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,079
Until then,
we are going to start shutting down all

573
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,922
non-essential systems manually.

574
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:25,255
Does anyone know how to do that?

575
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,341
Yeah.

576
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:43,502
Corrine,
you've got two more tornadoes out there.

577
00:38:43,607 --> 00:38:45,866
Corrine?

578
00:38:45,971 --> 00:38:46,964
Corrine, answer me.

579
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,542
You've got two more coming at you.

580
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,154
Can that plant take another hit?

581
00:39:09,083 --> 00:39:10,404
What the hell is going on, Jake?

582
00:39:10,509 --> 00:39:12,037
Ash, I don't have time to fight with you.

583
00:39:12,142 --> 00:39:14,437
Yeah, that's why I came here,
to have a discussion with you

584
00:39:14,541 --> 00:39:15,584
about us.

585
00:39:15,688 --> 00:39:17,147
All right, then why are you here?

586
00:39:17,251 --> 00:39:19,928
Because my father just told
me to get out of town, OK?

587
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:21,631
Because of a tornado, Jake?

588
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:24,133
Can you tell me what the hell is going on?

589
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:25,454
You might want to ask your dad.

590
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:32,286
Sheriff.

591
00:39:32,301 --> 00:39:33,378
Jake.

592
00:39:33,483 --> 00:39:34,665
If the second twister turns west,

593
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:35,986
it's going to head straight towards town.

594
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,445
Ashley, damn it, what are you doing here?

595
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:38,766
I want to know what the hell is going on.

596
00:39:38,871 --> 00:39:40,539
There's nothing you can do about it.

597
00:39:48,637 --> 00:39:49,994
It's Helman-Klein.

598
00:39:50,097 --> 00:39:51,097
Was it hit?

599
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,425
It's about to get hit again.

600
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,963
Again?

601
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:56,067
Can it handle another one?

602
00:39:56,109 --> 00:39:57,709
I mean, two twisters?

603
00:39:57,813 --> 00:39:59,933
It's supposed to.

604
00:40:00,037 --> 00:40:01,359
We don't know.

605
00:40:01,463 --> 00:40:02,470
Nobody knows.

606
00:40:15,505 --> 00:40:17,450
It can't be another one, can it?

607
00:40:17,555 --> 00:40:18,555
Corrine?

608
00:40:22,908 --> 00:40:23,908
Oh my god.

609
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:36,219
Corrine,
did we just get hit by another twister?

610
00:40:36,323 --> 00:40:38,061
Neville, we still need to reduce power.

611
00:40:38,166 --> 00:40:40,147
Just keep shutting down anything that's

612
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:41,920
not absolutely necessary.

613
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:43,344
Did we get hit by another tornado?

614
00:40:51,826 --> 00:40:54,537
We still need more power, Neville.

615
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:55,564
That's a yes.

616
00:40:55,579 --> 00:40:56,970
Oh great.

617
00:40:57,073 --> 00:40:58,568
We're in a nuclear power plant,
and we can't get power.

618
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:01,210
This is no time for irony, Potter.

619
00:41:01,314 --> 00:41:03,225
The instruments we do have read fine,
Corrine.

620
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:05,032
Yeah, well,
I'd prefer it if all our instruments

621
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:06,423
were working, Gail.

622
00:41:06,528 --> 00:41:07,883
I'd feel better.

623
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:35,654
The site team's been grounded.

624
00:41:35,758 --> 00:41:36,801
By whom?

625
00:41:36,905 --> 00:41:38,539
The pilots grounded themselves in Memphis.

626
00:41:38,643 --> 00:41:40,138
We've made a request to the military

627
00:41:40,242 --> 00:41:41,667
for some all-weather craft.

628
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:43,161
Send them on the ground then,
in trucks, I don't care.

629
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:44,224
It's already been done.

630
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,943
They're en route.

631
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,123
It's been 15 minutes.

632
00:41:47,227 --> 00:41:48,792
Get in contact with Corrine again.

633
00:41:48,897 --> 00:41:52,615
Let them know the
cavalry's stuck in the mud.

634
00:41:54,284 --> 00:41:56,960
Sheriff, I got the National
Weather Service on the line.

635
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:59,427
The second twister's turned west
towards the east side of town.

636
00:41:59,532 --> 00:42:01,026
Initiate the siren. Call the clinic.

637
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,556
- Tell them to expect casualties.
- Jake, where are you going?

638
00:42:02,660 --> 00:42:04,154
I told Corrine I'd take care of Campbell.

639
00:42:04,259 --> 00:42:05,510
I need you at the power plant.

640
00:42:05,614 --> 00:42:06,797
I gave her my word, Sheriff.

641
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,151
I'll head out and help the plant.

642
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,889
Thanks, Rollins.

643
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:10,995
Ashley, where are you going?

644
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:12,218
Dad, I'm a nurse, OK?

645
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:14,790
I need to be there when the tornado hits.

646
00:42:14,895 --> 00:42:17,432
Where's the siren?

647
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,600
Rollins, tell Corrine when you see her I'm

648
00:42:25,704 --> 00:42:26,712
heading over to Campbell.

649
00:42:26,816 --> 00:42:27,600
OK.

650
00:42:27,615 --> 00:42:30,466
Jake, are you OK?

651
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,099
Why wouldn't I be OK?

652
00:42:32,203 --> 00:42:37,696
Just with what happened, the tornadoes.

653
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:40,371
It was a long time ago, Ash.

654
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:52,606
OK, 4A, last one.

655
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,668
I don't think it's anything.

656
00:42:53,683 --> 00:42:55,177
I think it's the cafeteria.

657
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,790
Did you bring a flashlight?

658
00:43:06,578 --> 00:43:08,977
Campbell, let's go.

659
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,610
In the hall.

660
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:11,714
Stay here.

661
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:22,358
We've got more power.

662
00:43:22,462 --> 00:43:25,208
Nice work, Neville.

663
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:26,165
How's the reactor?

664
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,989
It's running a little hot.

665
00:43:28,092 --> 00:43:29,413
A little hot?

666
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:30,804
Only two degrees.

667
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:31,866
Is it rising?

668
00:43:31,881 --> 00:43:32,840
I don't know.

669
00:43:32,855 --> 00:43:35,078
I'm watching.

670
00:43:35,183 --> 00:43:37,060
Waste pool is definitely running hot.

671
00:43:37,164 --> 00:43:38,164
They both are?

672
00:43:38,207 --> 00:43:40,327
Well, that's not a coincidence.

673
00:43:40,432 --> 00:43:42,796
We just lost pressure on the diesel pumps.

674
00:43:54,055 --> 00:43:55,308
What the hell is going on?

675
00:43:55,412 --> 00:43:57,323
We got our instruments back,
but we're running

676
00:43:57,428 --> 00:43:59,235
hot along the coolant lines.

677
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:00,904
The diesel pumps are damaged,
and something's

678
00:44:01,007 --> 00:44:02,050
wrong with the electrical pumps.

679
00:44:02,154 --> 00:44:04,448
I shut down the electrical pumps.

680
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:05,553
Why would you do that?

681
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:06,987
You said you wanted power.

682
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,654
I gave you power.

683
00:44:08,758 --> 00:44:09,871
Turn them back on, Neville.

684
00:44:21,723 --> 00:44:22,723
Get down.

685
00:44:26,867 --> 00:44:28,639
Is it going to hit us?

686
00:44:28,744 --> 00:44:32,323
It doesn't even know
where it's going to hit.

687
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:44,732
Gail, how are we doing on the waste pool?

688
00:44:44,836 --> 00:44:47,234
It's getting hotter, too hot.

689
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:50,849
It's not getting enough water coolant.

690
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:55,437
We have a leak somewhere.

691
00:44:55,541 --> 00:44:57,697
At this rate, water in the waste pool

692
00:44:57,801 --> 00:44:59,921
will evaporate in 45 minutes.

693
00:45:07,011 --> 00:45:08,506
I need those electrical pumps, Neville.

694
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,870
If that water evaporates and
those fuel rods are exposed...

695
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:12,363
We know, Potter.

696
00:45:12,468 --> 00:45:13,824
It's going to throw radiation
up into the atmosphere

697
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:14,852
like a volcano.

698
00:45:14,867 --> 00:45:15,874
Potter, we know.

699
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:18,028
Neville, where are the electrical pumps?

700
00:45:18,133 --> 00:45:21,401
They're...
they're not responding, The electrical

701
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:25,258
pumps aren't turning back on.

702
00:45:25,363 --> 00:45:26,788
Go to SCRAM procedures now.

703
00:45:26,893 --> 00:45:27,900
Shut off the reactor.

704
00:45:28,003 --> 00:45:29,951
Without the NRC?

705
00:45:30,054 --> 00:45:31,480
And what would the NRC say, Neville?

706
00:45:31,584 --> 00:45:33,809
They would say go to SCRAM procedures.

707
00:45:33,914 --> 00:45:34,914
The NRC is not here.

708
00:45:34,991 --> 00:45:36,207
We are.

709
00:45:36,311 --> 00:45:37,876
I don't need the checklist.

710
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:38,980
Use the checklist, Neville.

711
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,361
We need water in that waste pool, Neville.

712
00:45:51,465 --> 00:45:52,508
It is steaming up.

713
00:45:59,076 --> 00:46:00,606
It's bad, Corrine.

714
00:46:00,710 --> 00:46:01,530
We have another problem.

715
00:46:01,545 --> 00:46:03,734
I don't want to hear it.

716
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,785
The reactor's not shutting down.

717
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,314
Shut it down, Neville.

718
00:46:07,418 --> 00:46:08,565
I can't.

719
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:10,512
We've lost computer control from here.

720
00:46:23,511 --> 00:46:25,735
I'm going to alert the NRC.

721
00:46:25,841 --> 00:46:29,559
Neville, Potter,
prepare to shut the reactor down manually.

722
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:47,076
Where's the radio?

723
00:47:07,896 --> 00:47:09,460
Oh.

724
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:14,604
Corrine, Potter recalculated the math.

725
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,341
The used fuel rods will be exposed

726
00:47:16,446 --> 00:47:18,148
in less than 39 minutes.

727
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,539
Corrine, this is going to make Chernobyl

728
00:47:19,644 --> 00:47:20,999
look like a firecracker.

729
00:47:31,496 --> 00:47:32,887
No.

730
00:47:32,991 --> 00:47:36,292
We've got to go to stage two procedures now.

731
00:47:36,397 --> 00:47:38,378
Dump the emergency tanks
into the waste pool.

732
00:47:38,482 --> 00:47:42,062
That might buy us some time.

733
00:48:13,134 --> 00:48:14,943
We lost our radio.

734
00:48:15,046 --> 00:48:18,243
So we are on our own, everybody.

735
00:48:18,348 --> 00:48:19,348
We're on our own.

736
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:23,597
We've got half of the state in our radius,

737
00:48:23,701 --> 00:48:27,559
including our families and my little boy.

738
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:30,235
Now,
this is not going to happen on our watch.

739
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:32,669
Do you understand me?

740
00:48:32,773 --> 00:48:35,240
We are not going to let this happen.

741
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,506
Lisa, why haven't we heard from them?

742
00:48:51,610 --> 00:48:53,383
The Sheriff's office is sending out a car,

743
00:48:53,487 --> 00:48:55,851
but they think Helman-Klein
was hit by a second tornado.

744
00:49:00,717 --> 00:49:02,942
We're going to shut down
the reactor manually,

745
00:49:03,045 --> 00:49:04,958
and then we'll divert the reactor's water

746
00:49:05,061 --> 00:49:08,746
coolant into the waste pool.

747
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:11,457
It's getting hotter faster, Corrine.

748
00:49:11,561 --> 00:49:13,543
At this rate,
the water coolant will evaporate in the pumps

749
00:49:13,647 --> 00:49:15,767
before it even gets to the
waste pool to replenish it.

750
00:49:15,871 --> 00:49:16,871
Great.

751
00:49:16,914 --> 00:49:19,207
We're leaking and evaporating.

752
00:49:19,312 --> 00:49:21,606
Wait,
if we increase the pressure of the pumps,

753
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:24,108
it will raise the boiling point.

754
00:49:24,212 --> 00:49:25,847
It'll still be leaking,
but it won't evaporate.

755
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:27,480
That can give us a few more minutes until we

756
00:49:27,584 --> 00:49:29,079
can shut down the reactor.

757
00:49:29,183 --> 00:49:30,817
Can the pipes handle more pressure?

758
00:49:30,921 --> 00:49:32,485
If the pipes burst, then nothing gets

759
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,856
through, no coolant, nothing.

760
00:49:35,961 --> 00:49:38,150
Can the pipes handle it?

761
00:49:38,254 --> 00:49:40,061
Well, if we don't try,
it doesn't matter either way,

762
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,174
does it?

763
00:49:46,457 --> 00:49:47,534
OK, let's do it.

764
00:49:47,639 --> 00:49:48,639
Gail, you stay here and you increase

765
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:50,837
the pressure to 2,200 PSI.

766
00:49:50,941 --> 00:49:51,726
2,200?

767
00:49:51,741 --> 00:49:53,548
Shut up, Potter.

768
00:49:53,652 --> 00:49:55,251
If there's damage in the containment room,

769
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:56,313
it could be hot.

770
00:49:56,328 --> 00:49:57,579
We'd better suit up.

771
00:50:09,467 --> 00:50:10,996
We're going to be fine, OK?

772
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,629
We're going to be fine.

773
00:50:17,634 --> 00:50:18,634
It stopped.

774
00:50:22,570 --> 00:50:23,528
I'm going to go take a look.

775
00:50:23,543 --> 00:50:24,551
Stay here.

776
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,706
Wait.

777
00:50:26,811 --> 00:50:27,811
Wait!

778
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:41,999
Stacy, you're scaring me.

779
00:51:13,975 --> 00:51:16,234
We need a damage assessment, Manuel.

780
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:17,590
Communication is down.

781
00:51:17,694 --> 00:51:20,266
I'm here for a relay so
you can talk to the NRC.

782
00:51:20,371 --> 00:51:21,588
I understand.

783
00:51:31,701 --> 00:51:34,655
Corrine, we've only got six feet of water

784
00:51:34,761 --> 00:51:37,575
separating those fuel rods from us.

785
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:38,688
It's getting hotter.

786
00:51:58,499 --> 00:52:00,480
Stacy, Stacy, are you OK?

787
00:52:12,054 --> 00:52:13,054
Stacy.

788
00:52:22,794 --> 00:52:25,922
How's the pressure holding up, Gail?

789
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:29,746
You're on borrowed time.

790
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:32,422
Where the hell is everyone?

791
00:52:32,526 --> 00:52:34,820
In the containment room
shutting down the reactor.

792
00:52:34,924 --> 00:52:36,349
My god, why?

793
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:37,453
Did the NRC recommend that?

794
00:52:37,496 --> 00:52:40,277
No, Corrine did.

795
00:52:40,381 --> 00:52:42,675
Our coolant's at 20% capacity.

796
00:52:42,780 --> 00:52:44,482
The waste pool is not
getting enough water coolant

797
00:52:44,587 --> 00:52:45,942
to contain the fuel rods.

798
00:52:46,047 --> 00:52:47,472
After we shut down the reactor, we're

799
00:52:47,576 --> 00:52:49,488
going to divert some of the
coolant to the waste pool.

800
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,463
Ready?

801
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:00,567
No.

802
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,359
Oh.

803
00:53:01,374 --> 00:53:02,417
Damn, that's too bad.

804
00:53:02,521 --> 00:53:03,634
Let's go.

805
00:53:06,692 --> 00:53:08,917
Corrine, I'm sorry about shutting

806
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:10,133
down the electric pumps.

807
00:53:10,237 --> 00:53:13,122
I... I didn't...

808
00:53:13,226 --> 00:53:15,207
it never occurred to me we
couldn't turn them back on.

809
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:17,050
Neville,
you're forgiven for not expecting us

810
00:53:17,154 --> 00:53:18,753
to be hit by another tornado.

811
00:53:34,811 --> 00:53:38,842
There's our leak.

812
00:53:38,947 --> 00:53:40,476
There are the circuits.

813
00:53:44,090 --> 00:53:46,002
Gail, how's the pressure?

814
00:53:46,106 --> 00:53:47,984
Just hurry up and shut it down.

815
00:53:56,846 --> 00:53:58,793
Wait, hold it.

816
00:53:58,897 --> 00:54:00,009
What is it?

817
00:54:04,737 --> 00:54:08,629
You were right, radiation leak.

818
00:54:08,734 --> 00:54:09,587
Shut it down.

819
00:54:09,602 --> 00:54:11,549
The pipes can't take anymore.

820
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:17,318
Corrine, this is Manuel.

821
00:54:17,423 --> 00:54:18,674
What the hell are you doing?

822
00:54:18,779 --> 00:54:20,690
No time to explain, Manuel.

823
00:54:20,794 --> 00:54:21,752
You've got three minutes.

824
00:54:21,767 --> 00:54:23,157
Do you understand that?

825
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:25,104
Then I lock down the containment building

826
00:54:25,208 --> 00:54:27,189
and reduce the water pressure to normal.

827
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:30,248
You reduce that water pressure
without shutting that reactor

828
00:54:30,352 --> 00:54:32,403
down and the water is going
to evaporate before it

829
00:54:32,507 --> 00:54:34,419
even reaches the waste pool.

830
00:54:34,523 --> 00:54:36,887
Those rods will be exposed in 20 minutes.

831
00:54:36,991 --> 00:54:39,319
If those pipes burst, the whole reactor

832
00:54:39,424 --> 00:54:42,900
is exposed in five with
a meltdown as its encore.

833
00:54:43,003 --> 00:54:46,792
Now, you've got three minutes
to shut the reactor down

834
00:54:46,896 --> 00:54:48,739
or you're locked in there.

835
00:54:48,843 --> 00:54:50,094
I've got a million other people to worry

836
00:54:50,198 --> 00:54:51,206
about, not just you three.

837
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,132
Three minutes, Gail.

838
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:02,398
That's all they get.

839
00:55:02,502 --> 00:55:05,875
You reduce pressure and you lock down.

840
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:20,020
We're going to have to
walk through this water.

841
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:22,279
That's 100 microcuries, Corrine.

842
00:55:22,383 --> 00:55:24,816
We go in there,
we got about a week to make our peace.

843
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:42,569
Campbell?

844
00:55:45,706 --> 00:55:46,706
Campbell!

845
00:55:54,986 --> 00:55:56,723
Campbell?

846
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:59,156
Stacy?

847
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:00,218
Stacy?

848
00:56:00,233 --> 00:56:01,122
Stacy, stay with me.

849
00:56:01,137 --> 00:56:02,667
Stacy, come on. Look at me.

850
00:56:02,771 --> 00:56:03,591
Look at me. We got to go.

851
00:56:03,606 --> 00:56:04,563
Look at me.

852
00:56:04,578 --> 00:56:06,316
Come on, stay with me.

853
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,205
Come on.

854
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,061
I need some help here.

855
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:10,089
Come on, Stacy.

856
00:56:10,104 --> 00:56:11,182
Campbell?

857
00:56:11,287 --> 00:56:12,503
Stacy, stay with me.

858
00:56:12,608 --> 00:56:13,608
Look at me.

859
00:56:13,685 --> 00:56:14,685
Stay with me.

860
00:56:28,699 --> 00:56:30,089
Have you got the NRC yet?

861
00:56:35,756 --> 00:56:38,397
This is Manuel Fluentez,
supervisor of Helman-Klein.

862
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:39,823
Martin Jennings, Manuel.

863
00:56:39,927 --> 00:56:41,316
Martin, we have a serious risk

864
00:56:41,421 --> 00:56:42,985
of a fuel rod exposure.

865
00:56:43,088 --> 00:56:44,654
The coolant is at 20%.

866
00:56:44,758 --> 00:56:46,878
We're risking a drop to 0%.

867
00:56:46,982 --> 00:56:49,380
I cannot... I repeat, I cannot...
assure you that

868
00:56:49,485 --> 00:56:50,840
the waste pool is contained.

869
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:52,335
Start evacuation.

870
00:56:52,439 --> 00:56:53,794
No, Martin, you don't understand.

871
00:56:53,899 --> 00:56:55,115
It's too late for that.

872
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:57,130
You'll only start a panic.

873
00:56:57,234 --> 00:56:59,355
We've only got minutes, not hours.

874
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,279
What?

875
00:57:00,294 --> 00:57:01,252
Minutes.

876
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:02,310
This is not a stage three.

877
00:57:02,414 --> 00:57:04,325
We are at an imminent stage four.

878
00:57:04,429 --> 00:57:07,906
I repeat, we are at a stage four.

879
00:57:27,613 --> 00:57:30,219
I think Manuel's right.

880
00:57:30,323 --> 00:57:35,224
I will lock down containment in 60 seconds.

881
00:57:35,328 --> 00:57:37,275
I don't want to, but I will.

882
00:57:55,314 --> 00:57:57,712
Get.

883
00:57:57,817 --> 00:57:58,929
I shut down the pumps.

884
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:00,736
It's my fault. I gave that order.

885
00:58:00,840 --> 00:58:02,022
You didn't know, Neville.

886
00:58:02,126 --> 00:58:03,308
That's why they didn't give me the plant.

887
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,428
You see, I kind of crack under pressure.

888
00:58:05,533 --> 00:58:07,479
Now listen, get out.

889
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,564
Get out!

890
00:59:45,424 --> 00:59:46,424
You did it.

891
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:48,900
It's shutting down.

892
00:59:49,003 --> 00:59:51,124
The reactor's shutting down.

893
01:00:14,585 --> 01:00:15,440
They did it.

894
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:16,984
They shut down the reactor.

895
01:00:19,694 --> 01:00:21,397
How much time did that
buy us before the fuel

896
01:00:21,502 --> 01:00:23,379
rods are exposed?

897
01:00:23,483 --> 01:00:26,159
We reroute what coolant we can.

898
01:00:26,264 --> 01:00:28,140
Maybe another 20 minutes?

899
01:00:28,244 --> 01:00:30,678
Lower the pressure below danger levels.

900
01:00:30,782 --> 01:00:33,354
We're not out of this yet,
not by a long shot.

901
01:00:49,516 --> 01:00:51,950
Get the fire trucks, Corrine.

902
01:00:52,053 --> 01:00:53,409
What?

903
01:00:53,513 --> 01:00:55,007
The fire trucks.

904
01:00:58,657 --> 01:00:59,657
Good call.

905
01:01:14,506 --> 01:01:16,418
Campbell!

906
01:01:16,522 --> 01:01:17,844
Campbell!

907
01:01:17,948 --> 01:01:18,991
Have you seen the boy
that lives in this house?

908
01:01:19,094 --> 01:01:20,450
Has anyone seen Campbell?

909
01:01:20,554 --> 01:01:21,547
Deputy!

910
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:22,562
Has anyone seen the boy?

911
01:01:22,639 --> 01:01:23,752
Deputy!

912
01:01:23,856 --> 01:01:24,814
What?

913
01:01:24,829 --> 01:01:26,497
I saw him go.

914
01:01:26,602 --> 01:01:27,595
Where?

915
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:29,173
I tried to stop him, but he took off

916
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:31,607
down the road on his bike
after the tornado hit.

917
01:01:31,711 --> 01:01:32,711
Thank you.

918
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:54,442
This is Corrine

919
01:01:54,547 --> 01:01:56,005
Maguire at Helman-Klein.

920
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:57,745
We need fire engines immediately.

921
01:01:57,849 --> 01:02:00,176
This is of the utmost importance.

922
01:02:00,281 --> 01:02:03,096
This is an emergency.

923
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:03,951
Corrine, this is Jake.

924
01:02:03,966 --> 01:02:05,460
What the hell is going on?

925
01:02:05,564 --> 01:02:06,522
Jake?

926
01:02:06,537 --> 01:02:09,909
Is Campbell OK?

927
01:02:10,013 --> 01:02:12,864
I'm looking for him, Corrine.

928
01:02:12,968 --> 01:02:14,254
What do you mean you're looking for him?

929
01:02:14,358 --> 01:02:16,826
Your house took a hit, the tornado.

930
01:02:21,309 --> 01:02:22,421
Is Campbell OK?

931
01:02:22,526 --> 01:02:23,519
He took off.

932
01:02:23,534 --> 01:02:24,785
Someone saw him on his bike.

933
01:02:24,890 --> 01:02:26,697
My guess is that he's trying to get to you.

934
01:02:26,801 --> 01:02:27,879
I'm heading out there now.

935
01:02:27,983 --> 01:02:30,938
But why didn't Stacy stop him?

936
01:02:31,041 --> 01:02:32,640
Stacy's dead, Corrine.

937
01:02:32,745 --> 01:02:34,830
She didn't make it.

938
01:02:34,934 --> 01:02:35,943
Corrine?

939
01:02:41,016 --> 01:02:42,859
Are you talking to the NRC?

940
01:02:42,964 --> 01:02:44,457
Where's their site team?

941
01:02:44,562 --> 01:02:47,134
No, this is the deputy.

942
01:02:47,238 --> 01:02:49,602
My son is missing.

943
01:02:49,706 --> 01:02:51,095
We need you in here, Corrine.

944
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,123
He's my son.

945
01:02:52,138 --> 01:02:52,958
I know, but...

946
01:02:52,973 --> 01:02:53,966
Give me your keys, Manuel.

947
01:02:53,981 --> 01:02:55,302
No, you cannot go, Corrine.

948
01:02:55,406 --> 01:02:56,329
We need you.

949
01:02:56,344 --> 01:02:57,344
He is my son.

950
01:03:00,202 --> 01:03:01,202
Jake?

951
01:03:01,280 --> 01:03:04,547
Corrine, I will find him.

952
01:03:04,651 --> 01:03:06,041
You understand me?

953
01:03:06,145 --> 01:03:07,571
I will find Campbell.

954
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,444
Corrine, can you trust me?

955
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:17,615
Just this one time, trust me.

956
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:18,728
I will find him.

957
01:03:22,759 --> 01:03:24,115
We need you in there, Corrine.

958
01:03:24,219 --> 01:03:25,213
It's going to be bad.

959
01:03:25,228 --> 01:03:28,460
The place is going to blow.

960
01:03:28,564 --> 01:03:30,684
Corrine, if Jake says he'll do it,
he'll do it.

961
01:03:37,497 --> 01:03:41,980
Jake, you find him and you keep him safe.

962
01:03:44,935 --> 01:03:46,150
Get him away from here.

963
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,611
You get as far away from here as possible.

964
01:03:47,716 --> 01:03:48,716
Do you understand me?

965
01:03:51,782 --> 01:03:56,856
Take care of my little boy, Jake.

966
01:03:56,961 --> 01:04:00,645
I am trusting you.

967
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:01,749
I know.

968
01:04:34,115 --> 01:04:37,870
Dr. Jennings,
they found the original blueprints.

969
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:39,120
Original blueprints?

970
01:04:39,224 --> 01:04:41,101
It was modernized in '87, but we found

971
01:04:41,206 --> 01:04:44,056
the original '67 blueprints.

972
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:45,655
And?

973
01:04:45,759 --> 01:04:48,052
There is another diesel engine
in the old maintenance area,

974
01:04:48,157 --> 01:04:49,548
near the waste pool.

975
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,946
The 10 electric pumps that
are down without power,

976
01:04:52,049 --> 01:04:56,116
we can hook them up to that diesel engine.

977
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:57,179
Good work.

978
01:04:57,194 --> 01:04:59,140
Good work.

979
01:05:09,986 --> 01:05:11,340
Campbell.

980
01:05:11,445 --> 01:05:12,974
Oh, thank God.

981
01:05:22,324 --> 01:05:25,173
Hey, Campbell.

982
01:05:25,278 --> 01:05:26,947
Came on, Campbell, get in the car.

983
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,997
Let's go.

984
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:30,059
It's Jake.

985
01:05:30,074 --> 01:05:31,082
Come on, Campbell.

986
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,749
Come on.

987
01:05:38,764 --> 01:05:40,641
Let's go.

988
01:05:40,745 --> 01:05:41,745
Come on.

989
01:05:46,689 --> 01:05:48,217
You're all right.

990
01:05:55,342 --> 01:05:58,332
Put your seat belt on.

991
01:05:58,436 --> 01:06:01,042
Manuel, have you heard from Jake yet?

992
01:06:01,146 --> 01:06:03,197
I've just been talking to the NRC.

993
01:06:03,302 --> 01:06:04,693
They found some original blueprints.

994
01:06:04,797 --> 01:06:06,604
There's another diesel engine in the plant.

995
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:10,044
It hasn't been used in 15 years,
but it's there.

996
01:06:10,148 --> 01:06:11,003
What about fuel?

997
01:06:11,018 --> 01:06:12,025
We need to get some.

998
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:13,172
All right.

999
01:06:13,277 --> 01:06:14,772
This is Raymond Ziff

1000
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:16,615
reporting from where a tornado has just

1001
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:18,526
crossed paths with Highway 6.

1002
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,333
There are no casualties at this time,

1003
01:06:20,437 --> 01:06:22,244
but traffic is backed up for miles.

1004
01:06:22,349 --> 01:06:24,991
And there's damage at the
Helman-Klein nuclear power

1005
01:06:25,094 --> 01:06:26,276
plant.

1006
01:06:26,381 --> 01:06:27,381
Multiple residents have been evacuated...

1007
01:06:31,177 --> 01:06:32,359
Melissa, you there?

1008
01:06:32,463 --> 01:06:33,387
Yeah.

1009
01:06:33,402 --> 01:06:35,487
We're here, Jake.

1010
01:06:35,592 --> 01:06:37,050
Jake.

1011
01:06:37,155 --> 01:06:38,580
Listen, I can't get a hold of the plant.

1012
01:06:38,684 --> 01:06:40,736
If you talk to Corrine,
tell her that I have Campbell.

1013
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:41,833
He's with me.

1014
01:06:41,848 --> 01:06:43,203
He's safe.

1015
01:06:43,307 --> 01:06:44,524
Jake, listen to me, we've got a...

1016
01:06:44,628 --> 01:06:45,628
We've got a situation.

1017
01:06:45,705 --> 01:06:46,705
Jake, look.

1018
01:06:47,861 --> 01:06:49,494
Sheriff, I'll have to call you back.

1019
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:51,092
Jake, damn it, listen to me!

1020
01:06:58,600 --> 01:07:00,581
Don't move.

1021
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:02,667
Sir, you need to get in my car.

1022
01:07:02,771 --> 01:07:04,022
There's a tornado.

1023
01:07:04,127 --> 01:07:05,169
There's a good chance it's heading this way.

1024
01:07:05,274 --> 01:07:06,386
There's a woman down there.

1025
01:07:06,491 --> 01:07:07,344
What?

1026
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:08,889
She's driving the other car.

1027
01:07:08,993 --> 01:07:10,105
Stay there.

1028
01:07:17,925 --> 01:07:19,420
Ma'am are you OK?

1029
01:07:19,524 --> 01:07:21,958
Help me.

1030
01:07:22,061 --> 01:07:23,061
Are you OK?

1031
01:07:27,483 --> 01:07:30,716
I'm scared.

1032
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:33,497
Ashley?

1033
01:07:33,601 --> 01:07:34,455
Jake?

1034
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:36,521
Oh my god, Jake, is that you?

1035
01:07:39,579 --> 01:07:41,178
Ashley, just hold on, all right?

1036
01:07:41,282 --> 01:07:42,240
Just hold on.

1037
01:07:42,255 --> 01:07:43,255
I'm coming down.

1038
01:07:47,434 --> 01:07:48,824
Hurry, Jake.

1039
01:07:48,928 --> 01:07:51,918
Can you please hurry?

1040
01:08:00,537 --> 01:08:01,537
Dear god.

1041
01:08:10,130 --> 01:08:11,381
Going to find the diesel engine.

1042
01:08:11,485 --> 01:08:12,528
Go there.

1043
01:08:12,632 --> 01:08:13,313
We'll take care of the waste pool.

1044
01:08:13,328 --> 01:08:14,475
Follow me.

1045
01:08:14,579 --> 01:08:16,004
Corrine,
we're sitting at 200 gallons per minute,

1046
01:08:16,108 --> 01:08:17,638
but the waste pool is getting hotter.

1047
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,189
Potter, this could be it.

1048
01:08:45,999 --> 01:08:47,529
Can you get the gate?

1049
01:09:01,605 --> 01:09:03,552
Gail, we found the diesel engine.

1050
01:09:03,656 --> 01:09:05,185
Now, we're going to need a hose, let's

1051
01:09:05,289 --> 01:09:07,027
say 50 yards just to be safe.

1052
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:10,120
Now where's the damn fuel tanker?

1053
01:09:13,353 --> 01:09:17,837
Sir, I need your help.

1054
01:09:17,941 --> 01:09:20,095
The thing's almost on top of us.

1055
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,181
Listen to me.

1056
01:09:22,285 --> 01:09:23,642
I need you to lower me.

1057
01:09:23,746 --> 01:09:27,360
When it's over,
lift the winch and bring it back up.

1058
01:09:27,465 --> 01:09:28,465
There's not enough time.

1059
01:09:28,507 --> 01:09:29,465
There's time.

1060
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:30,489
You can lower me.

1061
01:09:34,137 --> 01:09:36,710
Ashley, I'm coming.

1062
01:09:36,815 --> 01:09:39,247
Hurry Jake!

1063
01:09:39,351 --> 01:09:40,464
Let's go!

1064
01:09:43,557 --> 01:09:45,851
We have to rearrange the grid.

1065
01:09:45,956 --> 01:09:48,667
Put the pumps on the diesel engine.

1066
01:09:48,771 --> 01:09:50,021
We're losing an inch a minute.

1067
01:09:50,126 --> 01:09:51,760
We've only got a foot left.

1068
01:09:51,864 --> 01:09:52,872
Manuel's got it covered.

1069
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:26,621
I don't care how damn hot it gets.

1070
01:10:26,725 --> 01:10:29,297
We keep filling that pool with water.

1071
01:10:29,401 --> 01:10:32,216
If water evaporates and
the assembly is exposed,

1072
01:10:32,321 --> 01:10:34,093
we've got a nuclear bomb going off.

1073
01:10:37,743 --> 01:10:39,272
Ash, just hold on!

1074
01:10:42,505 --> 01:10:44,904
Jake, please hurry.

1075
01:10:45,007 --> 01:10:46,571
Just stay there, baby.

1076
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:47,676
Stay there.

1077
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:49,699
I got you.

1078
01:10:49,805 --> 01:10:50,805
Grab my hand.

1079
01:10:50,847 --> 01:10:51,847
There you go.

1080
01:11:00,648 --> 01:11:02,177
Jake, it's coming!

1081
01:11:05,828 --> 01:11:08,433
This isn't some plea to get my attention,
is it?

1082
01:11:08,538 --> 01:11:09,546
Get me out of here, Jake.

1083
01:11:09,650 --> 01:11:10,608
Please.

1084
01:11:10,623 --> 01:11:11,623
Get a hold.

1085
01:11:17,888 --> 01:11:19,869
Come on, kid.

1086
01:11:19,974 --> 01:11:21,015
I'm not leaving Jake.

1087
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,120
Come on.

1088
01:11:22,162 --> 01:11:24,491
We're not going to die here, OK?

1089
01:11:24,596 --> 01:11:26,125
Fine, fine, kill yourself.

1090
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:39,707
Hurry, Jake!

1091
01:11:42,356 --> 01:11:43,399
Ready?

1092
01:11:50,246 --> 01:11:51,246
Hold on.

1093
01:12:07,277 --> 01:12:08,270
Jake.

1094
01:12:08,285 --> 01:12:09,397
I got you.

1095
01:12:12,455 --> 01:12:16,105
I'm not going to let you go.

1096
01:12:16,209 --> 01:12:18,191
Jake, I'm slipping.

1097
01:12:18,295 --> 01:12:19,650
Jake.

1098
01:12:19,755 --> 01:12:20,755
I've got you.

1099
01:12:20,797 --> 01:12:21,910
I got you.

1100
01:12:28,096 --> 01:12:29,089
Hold tight.

1101
01:12:29,104 --> 01:12:32,755
Hold tight, mom!

1102
01:12:32,859 --> 01:12:34,213
Mom!

1103
01:12:41,164 --> 01:12:42,164
Hit the winch!

1104
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:04,035
Campbell, you listen to me.

1105
01:13:04,139 --> 01:13:05,251
You listen.

1106
01:13:05,356 --> 01:13:08,275
You never ever let anyone
tell you different...

1107
01:13:08,379 --> 01:13:10,987
What you did was incredibly brave.

1108
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:13,072
You saved our lives.

1109
01:13:13,176 --> 01:13:15,748
You're a man now.

1110
01:13:15,853 --> 01:13:16,853
Let's go.

1111
01:13:16,895 --> 01:13:18,251
Come on, let's go.

1112
01:13:18,355 --> 01:13:19,467
Get inside.

1113
01:13:39,522 --> 01:13:42,024
Hold it steady, hold it steady.

1114
01:13:42,129 --> 01:13:43,136
I've got your lines.

1115
01:13:43,241 --> 01:13:44,597
Needs more pressure.

1116
01:13:44,702 --> 01:13:45,702
Aim it over there.

1117
01:13:45,779 --> 01:13:48,768
Hold it steady now.

1118
01:13:48,873 --> 01:13:50,575
Keep that centered.

1119
01:13:55,093 --> 01:13:58,429
The water level's still dropping.

1120
01:13:58,535 --> 01:14:00,863
Gail, how are we doing?

1121
01:14:00,967 --> 01:14:02,496
It's slowing down.

1122
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:04,791
The hoses are helping,
but we still need that diesel engine

1123
01:14:04,896 --> 01:14:05,853
up and running.

1124
01:14:05,868 --> 01:14:07,049
All right.

1125
01:14:07,153 --> 01:14:09,240
Deputy, got any word on that diesel fuel?

1126
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,437
It's Jake.

1127
01:14:12,541 --> 01:14:13,758
Jake, is Campbell all right?

1128
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,597
Mom?

1129
01:14:19,702 --> 01:14:21,857
Oh, baby, hi.

1130
01:14:21,961 --> 01:14:23,524
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

1131
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:24,622
Mom, I'm OK.

1132
01:14:24,637 --> 01:14:27,070
Jake found me.

1133
01:14:27,174 --> 01:14:29,607
You are a very, very brave boy.

1134
01:14:29,711 --> 01:14:30,711
You know that?

1135
01:14:30,754 --> 01:14:31,936
I'm a very brave man.

1136
01:14:36,523 --> 01:14:37,636
Oh, hold on, buddy.

1137
01:14:37,740 --> 01:14:40,381
You got plenty of time for that.

1138
01:14:40,486 --> 01:14:41,668
I love you.

1139
01:14:41,773 --> 01:14:42,815
I love you too, mom.

1140
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,204
Let me talk to Jake, OK?

1141
01:14:51,678 --> 01:14:52,601
He's OK, Corrine.

1142
01:14:52,616 --> 01:14:53,574
I know.

1143
01:14:53,589 --> 01:14:54,597
I can hear that.

1144
01:14:54,702 --> 01:14:58,107
Jake, thank you.

1145
01:14:58,212 --> 01:15:00,610
You don't have to thank me.

1146
01:15:00,715 --> 01:15:05,372
Campbell and I are even.

1147
01:15:05,476 --> 01:15:06,728
Jake, what direction you heading?

1148
01:15:06,832 --> 01:15:08,291
West. Why?

1149
01:15:08,396 --> 01:15:10,203
There's supposed be a Salter
diesel truck heading west,

1150
01:15:10,307 --> 01:15:12,045
but it's late. We need that fuel.

1151
01:15:12,149 --> 01:15:14,896
I just saw Salter truck going east,

1152
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,181
heading away from you guys.

1153
01:15:16,286 --> 01:15:18,023
What did he say?

1154
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:20,735
Jake, you run that bastard down.

1155
01:15:20,839 --> 01:15:21,839
Do you hear me?

1156
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:23,932
You get that truck here to this plant.

1157
01:15:24,036 --> 01:15:27,964
If we don't get that diesel fuel here,
we lose everything.

1158
01:15:28,068 --> 01:15:32,239
And I mean everything for 100 miles.

1159
01:15:32,343 --> 01:15:33,804
Do you understand me?

1160
01:15:33,908 --> 01:15:35,854
I gotcha.

1161
01:15:45,864 --> 01:15:47,567
Unconfirmed reports have

1162
01:15:47,671 --> 01:15:49,723
at least two tornadoes hitting
the Helman-Klein nuclear power

1163
01:15:49,827 --> 01:15:51,007
plant.

1164
01:15:51,111 --> 01:15:53,023
Significant damage has been sustained,
but as of yet

1165
01:15:53,127 --> 01:15:54,170
there are no details.

1166
01:15:54,275 --> 01:15:55,387
No way.

1167
01:15:55,491 --> 01:15:56,491
Storm watch warnings remain

1168
01:15:56,534 --> 01:15:57,959
in effect until further notice.

1169
01:15:58,064 --> 01:15:59,064
No way am I turning around,
not for this kind of pay.

1170
01:16:06,753 --> 01:16:09,394
We're losing that water too fast.

1171
01:16:09,498 --> 01:16:12,035
He's not going to have enough time.

1172
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,991
Corrine, we're losing 250 gallons a minute.

1173
01:16:50,094 --> 01:16:51,659
Even with the hoses, we're still losing

1174
01:16:51,763 --> 01:16:52,763
more than we're putting in.

1175
01:16:55,586 --> 01:16:56,907
Can you get more hoses in there?

1176
01:16:57,010 --> 01:16:58,958
We'll have to save one
hose for the diesel fuel.

1177
01:17:03,371 --> 01:17:06,222
Gail, how's Potter coming on
switching those water pumps

1178
01:17:06,326 --> 01:17:08,690
over to the diesel generators?

1179
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,115
I think I got it.

1180
01:17:10,219 --> 01:17:11,470
If that diesel engine starts,
I think we should

1181
01:17:11,575 --> 01:17:12,583
have those pumps going again.

1182
01:18:10,348 --> 01:18:11,272
Pull over.

1183
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:12,399
Pull over now.

1184
01:18:16,501 --> 01:18:18,029
Hold on, all right?

1185
01:18:44,131 --> 01:18:45,131
Get out.

1186
01:18:45,174 --> 01:18:46,174
Get out.

1187
01:18:54,525 --> 01:18:56,923
This is not a good idea.

1188
01:19:12,703 --> 01:19:13,703
Crap!

1189
01:19:19,932 --> 01:19:21,983
Get out of the vehicle now!

1190
01:19:22,087 --> 01:19:23,860
Get out.

1191
01:19:23,965 --> 01:19:24,972
Now.

1192
01:19:25,075 --> 01:19:26,034
Get over there.

1193
01:19:26,049 --> 01:19:27,049
Get over there.

1194
01:19:27,126 --> 01:19:28,969
Stand right there, right here.

1195
01:19:29,073 --> 01:19:30,637
Move the car to the driveway, sweetheart.

1196
01:19:30,742 --> 01:19:32,374
It's blocking me.

1197
01:19:32,479 --> 01:19:33,905
I love you.

1198
01:19:34,008 --> 01:19:35,001
I love you too.

1199
01:19:35,016 --> 01:19:36,016
Come on.

1200
01:19:39,605 --> 01:19:41,551
Woo hoo, it's been a while.

1201
01:19:54,481 --> 01:19:56,288
Where's the site team?

1202
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:57,888
30 miles away from the plant.

1203
01:19:57,992 --> 01:19:59,520
Great, close enough to be killed,

1204
01:19:59,625 --> 01:20:00,806
too far to be of any use.

1205
01:20:03,656 --> 01:20:04,656
I'm sorry.

1206
01:20:29,445 --> 01:20:31,497
We just lost another hose, Corrine.

1207
01:20:31,601 --> 01:20:33,582
Three men have passed out from the heat.

1208
01:20:33,686 --> 01:20:34,765
We're down to minutes here.

1209
01:20:38,379 --> 01:20:39,908
I got you.

1210
01:20:40,012 --> 01:20:41,333
Here we go.

1211
01:20:41,437 --> 01:20:44,078
Let's get him out of here.

1212
01:20:44,183 --> 01:20:45,295
It's too hot!

1213
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:50,126
I don't know how long I can hold this.

1214
01:20:50,231 --> 01:20:51,189
Take five, Jesse.

1215
01:20:51,204 --> 01:20:52,351
That's an order.

1216
01:20:52,455 --> 01:20:53,846
We're going to need more
men to man those hoses.

1217
01:20:53,950 --> 01:20:55,409
We'll try.

1218
01:20:55,513 --> 01:20:57,286
They're going to need containment suits.

1219
01:20:57,390 --> 01:20:59,998
OK.

1220
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:26,865
Jake, follow me.

1221
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:27,969
Down there.

1222
01:21:44,590 --> 01:21:45,584
It's a water hose.

1223
01:21:45,599 --> 01:21:46,522
Yeah.

1224
01:21:46,537 --> 01:21:47,684
Improvising.

1225
01:21:47,789 --> 01:21:49,422
We just lost another one, Corrine.

1226
01:21:49,526 --> 01:21:50,777
We're not going to make it.

1227
01:21:50,882 --> 01:21:53,314
I don't have time for that right now, Gail.

1228
01:21:53,418 --> 01:21:54,984
Corrine, is this under control?

1229
01:21:55,087 --> 01:21:56,130
- Yeah.
- I'll go with them.

1230
01:21:56,234 --> 01:21:57,234
All right.

1231
01:22:01,169 --> 01:22:02,127
I got it.

1232
01:22:02,142 --> 01:22:03,135
They need you.

1233
01:22:03,150 --> 01:22:04,150
OK.

1234
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:15,976
Having trouble here.

1235
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,610
Keep holding on.

1236
01:22:22,754 --> 01:22:25,396
Keep it in the pool.

1237
01:22:25,500 --> 01:22:26,500
Hang on.

1238
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:32,172
It's too hot!

1239
01:22:36,726 --> 01:22:39,019
Jake, I've heard this room is radioactive,
right?

1240
01:22:39,123 --> 01:22:40,123
Yeah.

1241
01:23:00,187 --> 01:23:01,299
It's not filling!

1242
01:23:04,915 --> 01:23:06,478
Keep it going.

1243
01:23:13,046 --> 01:23:14,681
Warning... fuel rods

1244
01:23:14,786 --> 01:23:17,322
will be exposed in one minute.

1245
01:23:36,334 --> 01:23:40,922
Warning...
fuel rods will be exposed in 45 seconds.

1246
01:23:44,954 --> 01:23:46,449
It's really cooking.

1247
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:52,844
Warning... fuel rods

1248
01:23:52,948 --> 01:23:54,373
will be exposed in 25 seconds.

1249
01:23:59,030 --> 01:24:00,525
We're losing it.

1250
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:01,776
We're losing it.

1251
01:24:05,843 --> 01:24:07,964
Start, you son of a bitch!

1252
01:24:33,475 --> 01:24:34,475
We got it!

1253
01:24:34,518 --> 01:24:35,873
We got it! We got it!

1254
01:24:35,977 --> 01:24:36,977
We got it!

1255
01:24:37,019 --> 01:24:38,019
We got it!

1256
01:24:38,062 --> 01:24:39,175
We got it!

1257
01:24:44,318 --> 01:24:46,891
That's all we were waiting for, right?

1258
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:48,385
I think so.

1259
01:24:48,489 --> 01:24:50,436
Can you help my men over there?

1260
01:24:50,541 --> 01:24:53,565
Yeah.

1261
01:24:53,669 --> 01:24:54,669
Oh my god.

1262
01:24:54,712 --> 01:24:56,275
God, I hate this job.

1263
01:25:03,644 --> 01:25:06,077
We did it.

1264
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:07,815
We did it!

1265
01:25:07,919 --> 01:25:08,919
We did it!

1266
01:25:22,482 --> 01:25:23,482
Hey.

1267
01:25:27,069 --> 01:25:28,112
Hey.

1268
01:25:55,919 --> 01:25:58,212
Nice work.

1269
01:25:58,316 --> 01:25:59,316
Yeah.

1270
01:26:02,383 --> 01:26:03,383
You too.

1271
01:26:13,435 --> 01:26:15,452
Helman-Klein just reported in.

1272
01:26:15,556 --> 01:26:17,572
They're damaged, but they're stable.

1273
01:26:17,676 --> 01:26:22,159
They're downgrading back to stage one.

1274
01:26:22,263 --> 01:26:23,342
Thank you.

1275
01:26:30,641 --> 01:26:31,926
Company officials and the NRC

1276
01:26:32,031 --> 01:26:33,629
have confirmed that quick thinking

1277
01:26:33,735 --> 01:26:36,202
by the well-trained staff may have very well

1278
01:26:36,306 --> 01:26:39,086
diverted a nuclear disaster.

1279
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:40,929
This is Louise Wallace at the Helman-Klein

1280
01:26:41,032 --> 01:26:41,991
- nuclear power plant...
- Mom!

1281
01:26:42,006 --> 01:26:42,930
Campbell?

1282
01:26:42,945 --> 01:26:43,903
Campbell!

1283
01:26:43,918 --> 01:26:44,918
Mom.

1284
01:26:55,318 --> 01:26:56,326
Are you OK?

1285
01:26:56,430 --> 01:26:57,430
Yeah.

1286
01:27:01,366 --> 01:27:03,207
Jake said you saved the day, huh?

1287
01:27:19,335 --> 01:27:20,335
Thank you.

1288
01:27:37,722 --> 01:27:39,320
Never going to let you go, you know that?

1289
01:27:39,425 --> 01:27:40,432
I know that.

1290
01:27:40,537 --> 01:27:41,579
I do.

1291
01:27:45,125 --> 01:27:48,496
How does June of this year sound?

1292
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:50,129
That sounds like a plan.

1293
01:28:00,069 --> 01:28:03,268
Yeah, Sheriff,
your little girl's safe and sound, sir.

1294
01:28:03,372 --> 01:28:04,727
She's in good hands.

1295
01:28:04,833 --> 01:28:05,875
Rollins, thank you.

1296
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,056
Thank you for the Update.

1297
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:08,586
Oh, and Sheriff?

1298
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:10,950
Looks like Jake's back in the family again.

1299
01:28:11,053 --> 01:28:15,711
They just set a date for him
to become your son-in-law.

1300
01:28:15,815 --> 01:28:16,815
Copy that.

1301
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,126
The mess is in there.

1302
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:50,816
Oh, I'm so proud of you.
