1
00:01:26,652 --> 00:01:28,153
Do I look gross?

2
00:01:29,655 --> 00:01:31,656
No, I just don't need
to see you half-naked.

3
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:37,497
Mom, you need to get dressed.

4
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:40,866
I can't.

5
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:42,135
You can't what?

6
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:46,906
Go. I can't go.

7
00:01:46,938 --> 00:01:48,440
This trip was your idea,
though.

8
00:01:48,474 --> 00:01:50,009
I don't know what else to say.

9
00:01:56,515 --> 00:01:59,117
I'm sorry, Clark. I'm sorry
I'm always failing you.

10
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,486
It's okay.

11
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:03,122
I... I'm sorry.

12
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,492
I don't know,
what are we gonna tell Dad?

13
00:02:06,524 --> 00:02:08,026
Tell him to come upstairs?

14
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,729
Okay.

15
00:02:10,862 --> 00:02:14,467
Clark.
Thank you for your sensitivity.

16
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:18,537
-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah.

17
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:23,142
-Mom needs you.
-What?

18
00:02:23,175 --> 00:02:25,177
She doesn't wanna go.

19
00:02:27,546 --> 00:02:29,081
Wait here.

20
00:02:32,183 --> 00:02:33,785
You're not ready?

21
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,087
It's too much for me
right now.

22
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:36,554
Shit, May.

23
00:02:36,588 --> 00:02:37,923
I'm sorry, Roger,
I can't do it.

24
00:02:37,956 --> 00:02:39,792
-This weekend was your idea.
-No teaming up.

25
00:02:51,202 --> 00:02:52,837
Look, he was looking forward
to this!

26
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,106
Well, then, you go together!

27
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,107
W-without you?
What, just the two of us?

28
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:58,577
Dad, can you take me
to Etta's?

29
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,112
Couldn't you see her
when we get back?

30
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:03,882
-Just leave Mom here?
-Shoot. Gosh.

31
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,886
I just realized we have dinner
with the Friedlanders tomorrow.

32
00:03:06,918 --> 00:03:08,921
And Shira's gonna be there.

33
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:12,224
I knew we had something.
Yeah, I'm not going to that.

34
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,660
I'd rather not go either, May.
Come on, I'll take you.

35
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,298
Wait. Can I...

36
00:03:20,332 --> 00:03:22,235
Can I drive Clark?

37
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:27,540
I really... I'd really like
to spend some time with you.

38
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:34,679
So... tell me, is Etta's family
anything like ours?

39
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:37,049
In what way?

40
00:03:37,082 --> 00:03:40,819
You know, close, open,
full of love.

41
00:03:42,254 --> 00:03:44,756
Well, her parents
are getting a divorce, so...

42
00:03:47,259 --> 00:03:50,828
Well... I do think
you'll find it easier

43
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:53,933
to date someone
with a strong family foundation.

44
00:03:53,965 --> 00:03:56,834
-We're just friends.
-I knew that. I just...

45
00:03:56,868 --> 00:03:59,338
It was just a... an unrelated
thought that I was having.

46
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:02,808
But you should experiment.

47
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,243
I had a lot of boyfriends
before Dad.

48
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:07,613
Mom, keep your focus
on the road.

49
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:09,748
My planner's in my purse.

50
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,116
Okay, just focus on the road.

51
00:04:11,148 --> 00:04:13,117
No, if you're not going
to the restaurant,

52
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,654
then I have to let them know.
Okay.

53
00:04:18,624 --> 00:04:20,124
I just...

54
00:04:20,158 --> 00:04:21,761
I just...

55
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:25,264
Can I have the planner, please?
I need the planner now.

56
00:04:25,297 --> 00:04:27,232
-Yeah, yeah, sorry.
-Okay, where's my page?

57
00:04:27,264 --> 00:04:29,834
Boy, I am just, you know,
I am busy.

58
00:04:29,867 --> 00:04:31,636
Mom, you need to take a left
up here.

59
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,937
Busy, busy.

60
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:34,739
Where is it, dammit?

61
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:35,908
There it is.

62
00:04:40,177 --> 00:04:44,649
Clark! Baby! Sweetie?

63
00:04:44,682 --> 00:04:46,952
Are you okay?

64
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:51,957
Can you respond to me, Clark?
Please, can you say something?

65
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:55,026
Answer me, please! Are you okay?
Are you okay, Clark?

66
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,330
Are you okay, baby?

67
00:04:58,864 --> 00:05:00,199
Clark!

68
00:05:02,867 --> 00:05:04,869
Clarky, where are you going?

69
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,208
Come on back!

70
00:05:13,145 --> 00:05:17,049
Clarky? Where are you going?

71
00:05:17,081 --> 00:05:20,819
Please. Clark?
Who are you calling?!

72
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,656
No. No, no, no, please.

73
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,024
Please, Clark.

74
00:05:26,057 --> 00:05:27,692
Let's just keep this
between you and me.

75
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,028
I'm just so tired.
I just need to go home and rest.

76
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:32,030
I'd like to report
a car accident, in the Presidio.

77
00:05:32,064 --> 00:05:34,199
Please?
Please, please, please.

78
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:36,735
Please hang up.

79
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,237
<i>Still there?</i>

80
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:40,072
I'd like to report
an accident.

81
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,708
Please. Come on.
I'll be good.

82
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,108
Central and Washington.

83
00:05:44,141 --> 00:05:47,245
I'll just lie down. Please.
Come on, please.

84
00:05:59,256 --> 00:06:01,927
Clark? Clark?!

85
00:06:13,175 --> 00:06:17,789
<b>QUITTERS
Subrip: Pix</b>

86
00:06:19,376 --> 00:06:21,379
Hello, Mr. Rayman.

87
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:23,415
I have your paperwork.

88
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:29,121
If you could just initial here.

89
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:32,925
Here.

90
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:35,961
Here

91
00:06:36,294 --> 00:06:37,797
and... here.

92
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,300
Roger,
benzodiazepine withdrawal

93
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:44,102
can feature
a range of symptoms.

94
00:06:44,136 --> 00:06:46,405
Insomnia, irritability,

95
00:06:46,437 --> 00:06:47,772
depersonalization,

96
00:06:47,805 --> 00:06:50,308
derealization... psychosis.

97
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,277
I think you missed one.

98
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,780
In order to alleviate
the severity of those symptoms,

99
00:06:55,814 --> 00:06:57,482
we need to perform
a gradual withdrawal

100
00:06:57,516 --> 00:06:59,818
tailored to the individual
patient.

101
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,953
Chemically, this involves...

102
00:07:01,987 --> 00:07:03,489
delivering a dose of diazepam

103
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,824
equivalent to the quantity

104
00:07:05,857 --> 00:07:07,760
of benzodiazepines
May was taking,

105
00:07:07,792 --> 00:07:11,362
and then reducing it by 10%
every two to three weeks.

106
00:07:11,396 --> 00:07:13,398
What is derealization?

107
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,466
Feeling like the world
isn't real.

108
00:07:17,102 --> 00:07:18,537
The acute withdrawal phase
generally lasts

109
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,138
about two months.

110
00:07:20,172 --> 00:07:23,441
She needs to be here
for the entirety of that.

111
00:07:23,475 --> 00:07:26,445
But... symptoms can persist
for a year or more

112
00:07:26,477 --> 00:07:28,980
and we recommend
she make regular visits

113
00:07:29,013 --> 00:07:30,982
during that period.

114
00:07:31,016 --> 00:07:34,953
Our goal is not just to take May
off of her medication, but...

115
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:37,321
to find a more appropriate way
to treat the disorder

116
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,324
that made her seek help
in the first place.

117
00:07:39,357 --> 00:07:44,229
Roger... it can very painful
for a parent to admit to herself

118
00:07:44,261 --> 00:07:46,364
that being away
from her loved ones

119
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:48,033
is what's best for everyone.

120
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,400
But you can help with that,

121
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:51,470
by reminding her
how brave she is,

122
00:07:51,502 --> 00:07:53,337
how proud of her you are.

123
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:55,340
And that during
this difficult time,

124
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:58,209
she can have absolute confidence
in you as a husband

125
00:07:58,242 --> 00:08:00,045
and as a father.

126
00:08:13,225 --> 00:08:14,393
Hey.

127
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,131
Look at this view.

128
00:08:19,163 --> 00:08:22,166
Not bad.

129
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:25,036
Are you leaving?

130
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:27,538
They're gonna take really
good care of you, I promise.

131
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,841
So you're going home?

132
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:32,977
I got a hotel nearby,
in case you need anything.

133
00:08:33,011 --> 00:08:36,515
-So Pinky's with Clark, okay?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

134
00:08:36,548 --> 00:08:38,482
C'mere. Come on.
Is he okay?

135
00:08:38,516 --> 00:08:41,886
Yes, yeah, he's fine.
Come on now. Come on now.

136
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,155
Hey.

137
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:46,290
Come on now. It's okay.

138
00:08:46,324 --> 00:08:47,525
It's okay.

139
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,227
Okay?

140
00:08:49,261 --> 00:08:51,530
Yeah. Alright.

141
00:08:58,102 --> 00:09:00,271
I love you.
Me, too.

142
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:12,384
How did you know
when the revolution was over?

143
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,085
When they couldn't fire
on their own people.

144
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,620
That's amazing.

145
00:09:15,654 --> 00:09:18,056
Is there a more traditional
name for this dish?

146
00:09:18,088 --> 00:09:19,558
Pork adobo, with rice.

147
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:21,460
Okay, great. Guess
I can take it from here.

148
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:27,532
-I just make myself a bowl?
-No, no, no, I'll bring it up.

149
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,569
Okay.

150
00:09:34,973 --> 00:09:37,609
Should I get the door?
No, I got it.

151
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:53,492
Hey. What's up?
Hey. Nothin'.

152
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:57,963
Okay, just come on in.
I'm finishing up in the kitchen.

153
00:09:57,996 --> 00:10:00,465
-Alright.
-Have a seat here?

154
00:10:00,497 --> 00:10:02,467
I never heard your house
so quiet.

155
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,971
-Yeah, it's kind of nice?
-Yeah. Are you doing alright?

156
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:07,338
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

157
00:10:07,372 --> 00:10:09,141
I'm sorry to cancel on you
the other day.

158
00:10:09,174 --> 00:10:10,608
Things in my world
got a bit hectic.

159
00:10:10,641 --> 00:10:12,076
No, no, no, that's okay.

160
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:14,178
So how are things
at your house?

161
00:10:14,212 --> 00:10:17,482
Well, my sister caught
my dad jerking off

162
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:18,617
last night.

163
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,151
With porn?

164
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,219
No, she said
he was just hunched over.

165
00:10:22,252 --> 00:10:23,988
God, I wonder
what he was thinking about.

166
00:10:24,021 --> 00:10:27,325
Hope at the age
I still have a good sex life.

167
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,393
Alright, I'm gonna run this up
to Pinky.

168
00:10:29,426 --> 00:10:33,364
-Okay. Tell her I said hey?
-Yeah, yeah. And then wait.

169
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,667
Alright.

170
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,043
D'you mind keeping it down
on the TV?

171
00:10:45,043 --> 00:10:47,112
<i>Yeah, hello?
Hey, bud.</i>

172
00:10:47,145 --> 00:10:49,614
Just wanna let you know
everything's okay.

173
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,315
Okay, cool. Etta's here.

174
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:53,352
<i>I don't wanna keep you,
but if you could just...</i>

175
00:10:53,385 --> 00:10:56,188
for now, you know,
if we could just,

176
00:10:56,221 --> 00:10:59,324
respect Mom's
or our family's privacy.

177
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:02,194
<i>What you tell Etta,
Etta might tell her parents,</i>

178
00:11:02,227 --> 00:11:04,362
and her parents might tell...
God knows who.

179
00:11:04,396 --> 00:11:07,232
<i>Not because they're malicious,
but people get curious and...</i>

180
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:12,170
So if you could just say,
Mom's travelling for work.

181
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:15,441
-What would I say she does?
-Don't be... Let's just...

182
00:11:16,574 --> 00:11:18,075
let's just get through this
quietly.

183
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:20,078
<i>Okay?
Okay.</i>

184
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:22,414
Okay. Knock 'em dead, bud.

185
00:11:22,447 --> 00:11:25,250
Thanks.

186
00:11:34,092 --> 00:11:36,395
Jesus, you're so tight.

187
00:11:36,428 --> 00:11:38,429
That feels good.

188
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,404
It's nice to be finally settled.
Yeah.

189
00:11:46,438 --> 00:11:48,707
How'd I do?

190
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,275
It's great.

191
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,253
So can you take me
through it play-by-play?

192
00:12:02,554 --> 00:12:04,289
The divorce talk.

193
00:12:08,626 --> 00:12:11,096
Well, my sister picked me up
from volleyball

194
00:12:11,128 --> 00:12:12,596
and then we went home

195
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,665
and sat in the living room
with my parents.

196
00:12:14,699 --> 00:12:16,834
That's where your dad's
been sleeping?

197
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:19,237
Yeah, and whacking off.

198
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,540
Right.

199
00:12:21,573 --> 00:12:24,675
And then they said...

200
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:29,114
Take your time. It's fine.

201
00:12:29,146 --> 00:12:30,614
They said...

202
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:34,118
"Guys... obviously things..."

203
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:35,554
Wait, your mom said this?

204
00:12:35,587 --> 00:12:39,324
Yeah.
My dad couldn't really speak.

205
00:12:39,357 --> 00:12:41,126
So your mom said,
"Obviously things..."

206
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,561
Yeah.

207
00:12:42,593 --> 00:12:47,498
"Obviously things...
aren't really... working."

208
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:50,668
Nothing more
needed to be said.

209
00:12:52,436 --> 00:12:54,271
I dunno, sounds like a lot
more needed to be said.

210
00:12:57,675 --> 00:12:59,777
Do you have any idea
who's gonna come out on top?

211
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:00,878
No.

212
00:13:00,911 --> 00:13:02,713
Do you have any alcohol?

213
00:13:02,747 --> 00:13:04,649
Maybe we shouldn't
if you're upset.

214
00:13:04,681 --> 00:13:06,684
No, it's... it's fine.
I'm fine.

215
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:09,521
Okay.

216
00:13:12,189 --> 00:13:14,325
You wanna watch a movie
after dinner?

217
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,227
I'd love to, but I can't.

218
00:13:16,261 --> 00:13:18,497
I've gotta go
to Liam's party later.

219
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:21,333
His parties
are always more fun drunk.

220
00:13:21,366 --> 00:13:24,203
-You're going out?
-Yeah. Sorry.

221
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,545
Thanks.
Welcome.

222
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:42,721
-Clark.
-What?

223
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:45,857
We can't
just casually hook up.

224
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:48,792
I don't want it to be casual.

225
00:13:48,825 --> 00:13:50,694
I know that and...

226
00:13:50,727 --> 00:13:53,765
I'm not ready
for something more intense.

227
00:13:53,798 --> 00:13:55,867
Well, I-I just think
we have to learn

228
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,702
how to embrace intensity now,

229
00:13:57,734 --> 00:14:00,404
or we run the risk of ending up
just like your parents.

230
00:14:07,411 --> 00:14:08,546
I'm sorry.
Clark!

231
00:14:12,883 --> 00:14:15,586
I'll get you a Band-Aid.

232
00:15:31,663 --> 00:15:33,332
Fuck.

233
00:15:57,988 --> 00:16:00,358
You guys see Etta?

234
00:16:15,707 --> 00:16:17,542
You seen Etta anywhere?

235
00:16:26,883 --> 00:16:30,388
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

236
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,877
-Hey.
-Hey, dude.

237
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,414
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

238
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,717
-What happened?
-Nothing.

239
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:01,520
You know, I... I...

240
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,022
I'd really like to try
and be there for one another.

241
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,925
You need to go away.

242
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:10,761
-Okay, can we just...
-Dude.

243
00:17:12,597 --> 00:17:15,032
Alright, I'm gonna go get
a drink. Are you good?

244
00:17:15,066 --> 00:17:17,836
-Great.
-You probably shouldn't.

245
00:17:37,789 --> 00:17:41,059
Hey, hey, you and I play
volleyball together, right?

246
00:17:41,091 --> 00:17:43,094
-Yeah.
-Cool, cool.

247
00:17:44,628 --> 00:17:46,630
Is her depression
slowing her down?

248
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,103
You think she's depressed?

249
00:17:52,904 --> 00:17:55,940
-Yeah, I do.
-She's always laughing.

250
00:17:55,973 --> 00:17:59,077
That's true. But, you know,
like... bigger the smile,

251
00:17:59,109 --> 00:18:00,811
the deeper the frown.

252
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:05,083
She told me to keep an eye
on her. It's like she's...

253
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:07,452
putting me
in an awkward position.

254
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:09,053
I think she's gonna be fine.

255
00:18:11,121 --> 00:18:14,592
-Alright, I'm gonna go home.
-Did you take a cab?

256
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:17,729
No, I drove. Why?

257
00:18:17,761 --> 00:18:19,897
Think you can give me
a ride home?

258
00:18:19,931 --> 00:18:21,466
Left.!

259
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:37,515
-That party was pretty lame.
-I was having a good time.

260
00:18:38,683 --> 00:18:40,652
I'm supposed to call
my boyfriend.

261
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:43,620
It's morning where he is.
Who, who's your boyfriend?

262
00:18:43,654 --> 00:18:47,058
His name's Lassë.
He lives in Germany.

263
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:49,159
He lives in...
So he's German.

264
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:52,597
-Danish.
-What's he doing in Germany?

265
00:18:52,629 --> 00:18:54,832
He's studying
to be an architect.

266
00:18:54,866 --> 00:18:56,835
He should've stayed
in Denmark.

267
00:18:58,636 --> 00:19:00,805
Did you meet him
on the Internet?

268
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:03,907
No, actually, at a lecture
my stepdad gave in Berlin.

269
00:19:03,941 --> 00:19:06,911
So you just asked him
questions in the Q&A?

270
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:10,682
He made a comment.

271
00:19:10,714 --> 00:19:13,050
Was he like, "This is actually
more of a comment?"

272
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:16,855
Yeah... just like that.

273
00:19:16,887 --> 00:19:18,622
Yes, exactly like that.

274
00:19:21,192 --> 00:19:23,561
-Thanks for the ride.
-No problem.

275
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:57,594
<i>"Dear Etta,</i>

276
00:19:57,627 --> 00:20:00,298
<i>"I'm disappointed in myself
for falling for you.</i>

277
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:04,068
<i>"I'm disappointed in the part of
myself that is attracted to you.</i>

278
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,070
<i>"Most of all,
I'm disappointed in you.</i>

279
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:08,673

Etta,</i>

280
00:20:08,705 --> 00:20:10,308

00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,642

285
00:20:20,917 --> 00:20:22,753
<i>who refuses help."</i>

286
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:25,189
Hey. I'm gonna go drop Dad off
at his hotel. You should come.

287
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:26,925
I have to write an essay.

288
00:20:26,957 --> 00:20:29,093
We should make it clear
that we're not taking sides.

289
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,029
I really have to work.

290
00:20:32,062 --> 00:20:33,764
I think your teacher
will understand.

291
00:20:35,866 --> 00:20:38,136
Etta, don't be a selfish bitch.

292
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:50,147
<i>"For that reason, I recommend
we put an end to our friendship.</i>

293
00:20:51,682 --> 00:20:53,751
<i>Sincerely, Clark."</i>

294
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,787
As you filter out...

295
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,624
I'm gonna play a song
that always reminds me

296
00:20:59,656 --> 00:21:01,358
of Raskolnikov
sitting in his cell.

297
00:21:01,392 --> 00:21:04,295
Alright, please be sure
to grab your essays

298
00:21:04,328 --> 00:21:07,264
on Benjamin's The Storyteller
on your way out.

299
00:21:15,138 --> 00:21:17,641
-Mr. Becker?
-Yeah.

300
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:20,377
I'm really sorry, I didn't get
to finish my essay. I've got

301
00:21:20,411 --> 00:21:22,146
some stuff going on at home.
No problem.

302
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:23,180
Have it in by Friday.

303
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:25,082
Okay, thanks.

304
00:21:26,317 --> 00:21:27,652
Mr. Becker?

305
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:31,755
Mr. Becker?
Yeah.

306
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:33,124
You... you have a minute?

307
00:21:33,156 --> 00:21:35,158
What's up?

308
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:37,161
I was just wondering,
out of curiosity,

309
00:21:37,194 --> 00:21:39,163
what I could've done
differently to get an A.

310
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:41,198
I only gave two As. A minuses.

311
00:21:41,232 --> 00:21:43,901
Okay, so you're not...
grading on a curve.

312
00:21:43,934 --> 00:21:46,203
No.

313
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:47,771
Do you have a rubric?

314
00:21:48,873 --> 00:21:52,010
C is satisfactory, B is good,
A is exceptional.

315
00:21:52,042 --> 00:21:54,378
And a B+ is?

316
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,881
Better than good,
but not exceptional.

317
00:21:56,914 --> 00:21:59,250
So what makes an essay
exceptional?

318
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:03,021
If it makes me
feel something.

319
00:22:03,053 --> 00:22:05,689
And mine...
mine didn't do that.

320
00:22:05,723 --> 00:22:07,224
Correct.

321
00:22:07,258 --> 00:22:10,428
So I feel like, if you
explained your grading criteria

322
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:13,830
to the class, it, you know,
might help us improve.

323
00:22:13,864 --> 00:22:16,267
You mean it might help
you get an A.

324
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,703
Obviously, that's the goal.

325
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:21,204
For some. You know,
for others, the goal is to have

326
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,241
an encounter
with a work of literature.

327
00:22:23,273 --> 00:22:26,376
And those students who surrender
themselves to that experience

328
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,245
are the one who are awarded
the As.

329
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,881
You mean A minuses.

330
00:22:31,248 --> 00:22:32,350
Right.

331
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:37,755
Tsk.

332
00:22:38,388 --> 00:22:40,090
Here, Clark. Ahem.

333
00:22:44,761 --> 00:22:47,765
Thank you.

334
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:15,893
So the place where Mom is
is full of addicts, right?

335
00:23:15,925 --> 00:23:19,297
No, it's nothing like...
Your mother's not an addict.

336
00:23:20,798 --> 00:23:22,934
Ahem. She has a dependency.

337
00:23:22,966 --> 00:23:25,168
What's the difference?

338
00:23:25,202 --> 00:23:27,905
Well, actually,
it's pretty interesting.

339
00:23:27,937 --> 00:23:30,474
They explained to me that...

340
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,277
Mom was taking
what she was prescribed,

341
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:35,780
but Dr. Willner was
over-prescribing.

342
00:23:35,812 --> 00:23:37,147
So...

343
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:40,384
if anyone's really to blame,
it's Dr. Willner.

344
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,819
Technically...

345
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:44,456
we could sue.

346
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,795
Maybe it'd be useful if...

347
00:23:51,828 --> 00:23:53,931
to talk to somebody
about all this.

348
00:23:53,963 --> 00:23:56,032
What, instead of us...
just talking now?

349
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:59,837
No. I don't want it
to sound like...

350
00:23:59,869 --> 00:24:02,139
this conversation has to stop.

351
00:24:02,173 --> 00:24:04,342
This... this should...
this should keep going.

352
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,477
But maybe somebody who's...

353
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:09,213
who's less involved,
who's more objective,

354
00:24:09,245 --> 00:24:13,484
would be a good... outlet...

355
00:24:14,484 --> 00:24:16,053
in addition.

356
00:24:18,021 --> 00:24:20,325
I-I didn't mean to...
to end this conversation.

357
00:24:23,527 --> 00:24:26,431
No, I know. It's just kind of
hard to watch you eat.

358
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:32,170
Mom's, withdrawal is...

359
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:34,238
gonna be bad, right?

360
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,507
I'm gonna go visit her
in a couple of weeks.

361
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,809
You know, when it gets...
it'll get really brutal.

362
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,213
That'll be nice.

363
00:25:16,547 --> 00:25:19,416
-Nice job, Coach.
-Hey, thanks. He was great.

364
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,053
I'll see you at practice, Clark.

365
00:25:22,086 --> 00:25:24,422
Can we stop at the grocery
store on the way home?

366
00:25:24,454 --> 00:25:25,956
What for?

367
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:29,126
Groceries.
To give Pinky the night off.

368
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:48,546
Hello?

369
00:25:48,578 --> 00:25:50,548
<i>Hi, Roger.
How's it going?</i>

370
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:55,919
Good. I'm at the market.
Going home to cook for Clark.

371
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,954
<i>I've been trying
to reach him.</i>

372
00:25:57,988 --> 00:25:59,557
<i>How is he doing?</i>

373
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:03,426
Gonna try my hand at,
miso... halibut mushrooms.

374
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,097
<i>Sounds good.</i>

375
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:08,098
Yeah, I'm excited to see you.

376
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:11,435
<i>Well, I just think it might be
best if we...</i>

377
00:26:11,467 --> 00:26:13,470
<i>if we just kept it really
quiet around here</i>

378
00:26:13,503 --> 00:26:15,438
<i>for the moment.</i>

379
00:26:15,472 --> 00:26:19,443
<i>If you hold off visiting.
Can you understand?</i>

380
00:26:19,475 --> 00:26:22,579
What... I just... I mean,
I had some, meetings...

381
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:24,649
<i>-Okay.
-scheduled in the area.</i>

382
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:26,384
<i>-I'm sorry,
-No, no, no. I get it.</i>

383
00:26:26,416 --> 00:26:28,285
Hey, Rog!

384
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,088
Shit. Bradley Friedlander
spotted me, so I gotta go. Bye.

385
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,957
How the hell are ya?

386
00:26:33,991 --> 00:26:37,028
You know, we never got dinner
back on the books.

387
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:39,463
I know. I-I...
Hey, Shira.

388
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:42,532
It worked out. I mean, Shira's
been having some problems.

389
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:45,136
-What... what's going on?
-It'll be fine.

390
00:26:45,168 --> 00:26:46,937
Well, it's these college
acceptance letters.

391
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:50,141
They keep coming in, and
these kids can be so cruel.

392
00:26:50,174 --> 00:26:52,276
Just when Shira needs
her friends to help her

393
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,244
pick a school,
they get resentful. And why?

394
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:55,246
-Why?
-Why?

395
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:56,614
I...

396
00:26:56,646 --> 00:26:58,950
Because, well,
she got accepted to all of them.

397
00:26:58,982 --> 00:27:01,418
That sounds hard.

398
00:27:01,452 --> 00:27:02,453
I'm just worried
about balancing

399
00:27:02,485 --> 00:27:04,354
hard work and happiness.

400
00:27:04,387 --> 00:27:08,326
Hey, hey, hey, I just got a
Chris-Craft. Old wooden thing.

401
00:27:08,358 --> 00:27:12,429
-Gosh. What... what year?
-'74. New engine, old cut.

402
00:27:12,463 --> 00:27:16,533
You know, my grandpa had a,
a '50-something.

403
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:18,636
It was... Wisconsin.
No shit.

404
00:27:18,668 --> 00:27:22,238
Yeah, we'd get up early every
morning, before everybody else.

405
00:27:22,271 --> 00:27:25,675
I was his favourite. And...
and we'd motor into town,

406
00:27:25,709 --> 00:27:27,712
say hi to his old buddies,
Irv and Al...

407
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:30,548
Yeah, the lines on this thing
are just boom. I'm telling you,

408
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,415
mwah! I got it here
at Richardson Bay.

409
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:34,617
Gosh, man, I'd love
to get out on the water.

410
00:27:34,651 --> 00:27:36,087
You know what water gives you,
right?

411
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,053
Perspective.

412
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:38,521
-Right.
-Yeah.

413
00:27:38,555 --> 00:27:40,591
If your boat's got the pull,
I got the skis.

414
00:27:40,624 --> 00:27:42,193
Why don't you talk to Clark,

415
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,127
then the four of us
can do a double date?

416
00:27:44,161 --> 00:27:46,030
That sounds...
that sounds great.

417
00:27:46,062 --> 00:27:49,032
I mean, I...
I'll run that by him.

418
00:27:49,066 --> 00:27:51,102
He would just...
he would love that.

419
00:27:51,135 --> 00:27:52,770
What can I get for you?

420
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:55,473
No, I'm... I...
I'm... I'm good.

421
00:27:55,505 --> 00:27:58,542
Okay, well, it's...
Good luck with the...

422
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:15,259
The fish looked funky.
Let's get Mexican.

423
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:19,462
-Hey, what's Body Garden?
-What?

424
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:21,765
It says Body Garden. You were
there the day before yesterday?

425
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:24,402
-It's a spa.
-What do you go for?

426
00:28:24,434 --> 00:28:26,569
I think I had a...
a manicure.

427
00:28:26,603 --> 00:28:28,339
Mom wants you to call her.

428
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:32,276
No, from the car.

429
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:36,146
Yeah, hi.
Do you have manicures?

430
00:28:37,614 --> 00:28:41,752
No. Okay. Just massages. I see.
How much are those?

431
00:28:44,288 --> 00:28:46,290
Got it. Thank you.

432
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:51,428
What... what happened to
that masseuse you and Mom liked?

433
00:28:51,462 --> 00:28:53,463
Dina talks too much.

434
00:28:53,496 --> 00:28:56,399
So, what, you just wanna be
touched in silence?

435
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,667
She's overpriced.

436
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,636
You know, they... they said,...

437
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,405
a 30-minute costs $30.
Bradley's on his...

438
00:29:02,438 --> 00:29:04,441
And an hour long costs $50.

439
00:29:04,474 --> 00:29:07,278
And you paid 100.
Two hours.

440
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,545
Isn't it degrading?

441
00:29:10,313 --> 00:29:13,117
-I feel better after.
-For the women, I mean.

442
00:29:13,149 --> 00:29:15,552
Bradley and Shira are
on their way out.

443
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,621
Let's not do this here.

444
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:19,857
-You can go.
-What about dinner?

445
00:29:19,889 --> 00:29:23,726
-Yeah, go ahead and eat.
-I... I cleared my night!

446
00:29:25,796 --> 00:29:29,467
Hey... is there any chance
you guys would give me a ride

447
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,268
to Clement St.?

448
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:34,137
-Sure, Clark, yeah.
-Let me help you guys.

449
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,372
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

450
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:37,075
Thanks, Clark.

451
00:30:57,788 --> 00:30:59,589
-Clark?
-Hey.

452
00:30:59,623 --> 00:31:01,959
-What's... going on?
-Just browsing.

453
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,560
You ready, Nat?

454
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:05,563
Mom, this is Clark.
He's the boy

455
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:07,565
who drove me home
the other night.

456
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:09,934
Hello. Veronica.
Nice to meet you.

457
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:11,968
Likewise, yeah.
Are you guys cooking?

458
00:31:12,001 --> 00:31:13,937
Do you wanna join us?

459
00:31:13,971 --> 00:31:15,806
No, I didn't mean
to invite myself.

460
00:31:15,838 --> 00:31:18,242
I just invited you.

461
00:31:18,274 --> 00:31:20,476
Well, thanks. I just haven't
showered since cross-country.

462
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:23,747
We have running water, but,
of course, no pressure.

463
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:26,416
Was that a pun?

464
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,487
-Never mind. Sorry.
-It-it's okay.

465
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:33,256
So, I mean,
if it's not an imposition...

466
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:36,460
-I think he's saying yes.
-Yes. Yes, I'm saying yes.

467
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:44,468
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

468
00:31:46,536 --> 00:31:48,372
Natalia's always singing
Mr. Becker's praises.

469
00:31:48,405 --> 00:31:51,242
-Do you like him, Clark?
-He's clearly smart, but,

470
00:31:51,274 --> 00:31:53,009
I don't know, he seems
to get off on feeling

471
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:54,811
like he's tricked us into
believing that he's brilliant,

472
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,313
even though
he actually might be.

473
00:31:56,346 --> 00:31:57,780
I don't know if that makes
any sense.

474
00:31:57,813 --> 00:31:59,550
I think he actually is.

475
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:02,252
At his age, I wanted people
to think I had talent.

476
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:04,555
Whether we had it or not
was a secondary concern.

477
00:32:04,588 --> 00:32:06,957
-But you were talented, Todd.
-How did you two meet?

478
00:32:08,858 --> 00:32:10,360
-He found me under a tank.
-What?

479
00:32:10,394 --> 00:32:11,694
First, when we met,
it was 1986...

480
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:13,397
Come on.

481
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,366
She thought it prudent
to lay down in the middle

482
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:18,334
of a street right in front
of one of Marcos's tanks.

483
00:32:18,367 --> 00:32:20,271
-I thought it would stop.
-Did it?

484
00:32:20,303 --> 00:32:21,838
-No. God, no!
-So it just...

485
00:32:21,871 --> 00:32:23,406
Rolling and rolling
and rolling.

486
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,309
-So what'd you do?
-I got up and ran.

487
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:26,809
-My God.
-Made for one hell

488
00:32:26,842 --> 00:32:28,911
of a photograph. I was there
taking pictures for Time

489
00:32:28,944 --> 00:32:31,482
and I tried to sell my editor
on putting this great photo

490
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:32,782
on the cover.

491
00:32:32,816 --> 00:32:35,552
Young British girl
engaging in a failed act

492
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:37,354
of civil disobedience.

493
00:32:38,855 --> 00:32:41,358
It's incredible.

494
00:32:43,859 --> 00:32:47,830
Here it is. He says
his editor didn't go for it.

495
00:32:47,864 --> 00:32:50,501
I couldn't tell if it was a...

496
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:52,802
good photo or
if I just loved the girl in it.

497
00:32:56,673 --> 00:32:59,676
Well, we stayed in touch.

498
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,980
She met Patrick
and they had Natalia.

499
00:33:03,012 --> 00:33:05,549
And later, after Patrick passed,

500
00:33:05,581 --> 00:33:07,684
rest his soul...

501
00:33:07,717 --> 00:33:12,488
you know, well, after
an appropriate interval...

502
00:33:12,521 --> 00:33:15,559
it comes time
to take what's yours.

503
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,333
So... so you were both in the
Philippines for People Power.

504
00:33:22,366 --> 00:33:23,867
Exactly.

505
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:26,703
A friend of mine, Pinky
Lapeira - she's a family friend,

506
00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:28,438
friend of the family...
told me about it.

507
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:31,608
What happened...

508
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:37,548
No, please let me help you.

509
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,482
We got it.
You go and join Natty.

510
00:33:39,515 --> 00:33:40,717
No, you go on.

511
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:42,920
Okay. Thanks for dinner,
you guys.

512
00:33:51,528 --> 00:33:52,762
Hey.

513
00:33:55,432 --> 00:33:56,900
What a dinner.

514
00:33:56,933 --> 00:33:58,969
-You have fun?
-Yeah, I did.

515
00:34:05,776 --> 00:34:07,611
-Here.
-Thank you.

516
00:34:18,789 --> 00:34:20,790
-You alright there, champ?
-Yeah.

517
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:29,667
I was wondering
where your boyfriend is.

518
00:34:30,801 --> 00:34:32,803
Another beautiful day
in Germany.

519
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:38,141
I should probably leave before
I build the courage to kiss you.

520
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:42,813
It's giving you a lot of
confidence, isn't it?

521
00:34:47,984 --> 00:34:49,819
Sto...

522
00:35:00,664 --> 00:35:03,566
<i>-Sorry to keep you waiting.
-Hi.</i>

523
00:35:05,502 --> 00:35:09,106
<i>-If a suite becomes available?
-We will let you know.</i>

524
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:12,709
<i>And, in the meantime,
if there's anything else...</i>

525
00:35:25,856 --> 00:35:28,658
-Clark?!
-Yeah?!

526
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:34,030
-How was your night?
-Good, good.

527
00:35:34,064 --> 00:35:36,167
I'm gonna visit Mom...

528
00:35:37,566 --> 00:35:40,170
in a couple of weeks.
Nice!

529
00:35:42,037 --> 00:35:44,140
It'd be easy to get...

530
00:35:44,173 --> 00:35:47,677
get an adjoining room
if you wanna see her.

531
00:35:47,711 --> 00:35:51,848
Sorry. I gotta go do homework.

532
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:54,551
-Can I help?
-No, no, no, I'm okay.

533
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:09,566
Get it, get it, get it!

534
00:36:30,086 --> 00:36:31,988
-Hey.
-Good game.

535
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:35,259
Thanks. I'm, happy you're
seeing Natalia. She's awesome.

536
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:37,861
Thank you. Thanks.

537
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:40,531
Does that mean
we can be friends again?

538
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:43,834
-No, I don't think so.
-Why not?

539
00:36:46,602 --> 00:36:49,272
can we just not talk
about this now?

540
00:36:49,305 --> 00:36:51,274
-I miss you.
-Hey.

541
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:53,743
Hi! You killed it, girl.

542
00:36:53,776 --> 00:36:56,713
Thanks. Am I interrupting
something or...?

543
00:36:56,745 --> 00:36:58,214
No.

544
00:36:58,247 --> 00:37:00,550
I told Todd and your mom
that we're gonna feed Gus

545
00:37:00,584 --> 00:37:02,586
when they go out to dinner
with the Owens, so...

546
00:37:02,618 --> 00:37:04,086
Okay.

547
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,222
Okay, have a good night, guys.

548
00:37:05,254 --> 00:37:07,223
You, too.

549
00:37:07,256 --> 00:37:09,091
-Hey, look who's here.
-Hey.

550
00:37:09,124 --> 00:37:11,661
Look at you, girl.
You did so great.

551
00:37:11,694 --> 00:37:13,597
Great game, Natty.

552
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:37,019
-I don't wanna finish.
-Why?

553
00:37:37,053 --> 00:37:41,124
-I'm just nervous.
-You're doing great.

554
00:37:42,892 --> 00:37:45,995
It's just, you know,
seeing Etta after your game,

555
00:37:46,028 --> 00:37:49,632
I kinda got... hard.
Not in a good way, though.

556
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:52,635
Like... I was really
uncomfortable.

557
00:37:52,669 --> 00:37:54,972
But... you know,

558
00:37:55,004 --> 00:37:56,973
I really like you,
I just don't...

559
00:37:57,006 --> 00:37:59,776
want you to finish something
she started.

560
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,216
Won't it hurt
if you don't come?

561
00:38:07,249 --> 00:38:09,152
No, it'll be fine.

562
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,324
Looks sort of... puffy.

563
00:38:16,426 --> 00:38:19,296
Yeah, yeah, I think
if we just stop looking at it,

564
00:38:19,328 --> 00:38:21,031
it'll go away.

565
00:38:35,211 --> 00:38:38,180
Were you and your dad close?

566
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:42,953
Yeah, but he didn't really
like to hug or touch.

567
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:45,355
Even with your mom?

568
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:48,425
He could be warm with her.

569
00:38:48,457 --> 00:38:50,660
She and Todd seem
pretty affectionate.

570
00:38:50,693 --> 00:38:53,229
I was actually surprised
they've only been together

571
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:54,731
for a few years.

572
00:38:55,999 --> 00:38:59,002
She was seeing Todd
before that.

573
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:02,339
-When your dad was sick?
-Yeah.

574
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:04,074
Did your dad know?

575
00:39:04,106 --> 00:39:05,875
I told him.

576
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:07,711
Did he have long enough
to fix things with your mom

577
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:08,979
or find somebody else?

578
00:39:09,011 --> 00:39:11,180
He was pretty sick
at that point.

579
00:39:11,214 --> 00:39:12,883
Guess it was the right thing
to do.

580
00:39:14,383 --> 00:39:15,851
I think I told because...

581
00:39:15,885 --> 00:39:17,354
I was mad at my mom,

582
00:39:17,386 --> 00:39:20,356
'cause she wouldn't let me go
to Tahoe with my cousins

583
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,359
or something.
Did it work?

584
00:39:22,392 --> 00:39:24,060
I went to Tahoe, but...

585
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:26,062
I probably should've been
hanging out with my dad

586
00:39:26,095 --> 00:39:27,697
instead of getting drunk

587
00:39:27,731 --> 00:39:29,332
and making out
with all my cousins' friends!

588
00:39:29,365 --> 00:39:32,368
Kind of hard to imagine
you having a promiscuous phase.

589
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:34,804
I think that's giving
my 13-year-old self

590
00:39:34,838 --> 00:39:36,073
a little too much credit.

591
00:39:36,106 --> 00:39:38,008
Okay.

592
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,910
When do I get
to see your house?

593
00:39:40,943 --> 00:39:44,380
-There's nothing there.
-What about your parents?

594
00:39:44,414 --> 00:39:47,383
-They're not really around.
-Where are they?

595
00:39:47,417 --> 00:39:50,319
My dad is visiting my mom
at rehab.

596
00:39:51,787 --> 00:39:54,057
What's she there for?

597
00:39:57,127 --> 00:39:59,362
You don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

598
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:00,430
She just has, like, problems.

599
00:40:01,430 --> 00:40:03,166
I'm sorry.

600
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,002
You got lucky with the way
things turned out here

601
00:40:07,035 --> 00:40:08,304
at the Abernathy residence.
Williams.

602
00:40:08,338 --> 00:40:10,973
I didn't take Todd's name.

603
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:57,153
When I get outta here,

604
00:40:57,187 --> 00:40:59,322
I'll make it up to them
and I'm bringing my girls

605
00:40:59,354 --> 00:41:01,157
on the most amazing trip
of a lifetime.

606
00:41:01,191 --> 00:41:03,526
'Cause you don't get that
a whole lot with your girls.

607
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,529
Once they're grown up,
they're outta there.

608
00:41:05,562 --> 00:41:07,998
It's, you know,
it's the way it goes.

609
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:10,567
-Hi.
-Roger.

610
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,435
Hi. Sorry,
I didn't mean to interrupt.

611
00:41:12,468 --> 00:41:14,004
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah. Yeah.

612
00:41:14,037 --> 00:41:15,805
No, no, no, no, it's...
it's fine.

613
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,407
Well... my God... Roger...

614
00:41:17,439 --> 00:41:21,343
Wh-wh-why don't you guys
finish up here

615
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:25,115
and I'll wait for you in your
room? Okay? Go ahead.

616
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:45,435
Hi.
Hi, Roger. What's going on?

617
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:49,339
-I had a meeting nearby.
-So you just came to...?

618
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,607
-To see you.
-You can't just show up.

619
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,077
Well, you know,
I wanted to see what

620
00:41:54,109 --> 00:41:55,878
we're spending our money on.

621
00:41:55,912 --> 00:41:58,548
I... I...I thought we could
have a night together.

622
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:01,017
I booked a room
at a bed-and-breakfast.

623
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,151
R-R-Roger, I'm...

624
00:42:02,185 --> 00:42:04,020
I'm in the middle of rehab.

625
00:42:04,053 --> 00:42:05,288
You can take a night off.

626
00:42:05,321 --> 00:42:07,057
Who's with Clark?

627
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,425
<i>-I could call Pinky.
-You could call Pinky?</i>

628
00:42:08,457 --> 00:42:10,093
I could call Pinky.

629
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:12,028
You're not the only one
who needs a vacation.

630
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,231
This is not a vacation!

631
00:42:15,265 --> 00:42:18,033
When I'm out of here,
you can do whatever you want,

632
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:20,970
but right now, I need you
to be a father to our son.

633
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:24,241
What the fuck do you think
I've been doing?

634
00:42:25,274 --> 00:42:26,542
Roger...

635
00:42:26,575 --> 00:42:29,378
Why can't we just have... fun
together?

636
00:42:29,412 --> 00:42:33,884
'Cause it doesn't sound
like fun right now.

637
00:42:33,917 --> 00:42:36,419
-Okay.
-I need more time here.

638
00:42:36,452 --> 00:42:39,555
I'm getting better.
I-I'm feeling better.

639
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:41,558
But when you show up
out of the blue and...

640
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:43,426
and I see what kind of state
you're in

641
00:42:43,459 --> 00:42:45,562
and how this is affecting you,

642
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:48,966
I feel terrible for leaving
Clark alone with you.

643
00:42:53,002 --> 00:42:55,606
Okay. Okay.

644
00:43:05,981 --> 00:43:09,118
I'd like to cancel the room
I booked for tonight.

645
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:12,488
<i>We do have a 24-hour
cancellation fee.</i>

646
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:14,290
<i>-Okay. How much?
-$462.</i>

647
00:43:14,323 --> 00:43:15,959
What, to... to cancel?

648
00:43:15,992 --> 00:43:18,662
<i>We'll have to charge you
for a night.</i>

649
00:43:18,694 --> 00:43:21,298
<i>-Okay.
-We have a card on file.</i>

650
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,599
<i>-That's fine.
-I can go ahead and run that.</i>

651
00:43:23,633 --> 00:43:26,269
<i>-It's a little steep, but...
-I'm sorry, sir.</i>

652
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:27,604
No, fine.

653
00:43:27,636 --> 00:43:30,173
<i>We have a VISA that ends
in 8446.</i>

654
00:43:30,205 --> 00:43:32,309
<i>I'll go ahead and charge $462...
Okay.</i>

655
00:43:32,341 --> 00:43:34,144
<i>I'm gonna go ahead
and run that now.</i>

656
00:43:34,176 --> 00:43:35,511
Okay, thanks.

657
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,361
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

658
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:54,330
-So you all set?
-Yeah, I'm good.

659
00:43:54,363 --> 00:43:56,365
-Okay, good night.
-Good night.

660
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:18,689
Clark?

661
00:44:21,223 --> 00:44:22,691
Clark?

662
00:44:22,725 --> 00:44:24,194
Good morning, Mr. Rayman.

663
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:26,229
Hi, Pinky.

664
00:44:26,261 --> 00:44:28,131
-Should I go wake Mr. Clark?
-He's not there.

665
00:44:28,164 --> 00:44:31,600
He must've slept out.
They do grow up so fast.

666
00:44:33,102 --> 00:44:35,105
My son is applying
to high school.

667
00:44:35,138 --> 00:44:37,340
He's been asking
about Seneca.

668
00:44:37,372 --> 00:44:40,010
Goddammit.

669
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:42,044
I understand Seneca
is sort of political.

670
00:44:42,077 --> 00:44:43,545
It can be sometimes.

671
00:44:43,578 --> 00:44:46,383
Despite his good grades
and strong sense of humor,

672
00:44:46,415 --> 00:44:48,584
his application
might be ignored.

673
00:44:50,252 --> 00:44:51,488
I think their admissions
process actually is

674
00:44:51,521 --> 00:44:53,323
pretty thorough.

675
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:55,691
If you'd be willing to say
something to the administration,

676
00:44:55,725 --> 00:44:57,493
it would go a very long way.

677
00:45:03,066 --> 00:45:04,667
-Clark?
-Yeah?

678
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:07,004
Can you come in here, please?

679
00:45:11,673 --> 00:45:13,142
-Can I make you breakfast?
-No, I'm okay.

680
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:15,278
Can you show Francis
around Seneca?

681
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,446
-Who?
-My son.

682
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:19,415
-Pinky's son.
-Yeah, sure.

683
00:45:19,448 --> 00:45:21,350
She's afraid,
without a proper introduction,

684
00:45:21,383 --> 00:45:23,586
his application might fall
through the cracks.

685
00:45:23,618 --> 00:45:26,022
-Yeah, of course.
-Thank you.

686
00:45:27,122 --> 00:45:28,758
Hey, c-can I make you
breakfast, Clark?

687
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:31,394
I wanna... I wanna tell you
about my visit with Mom.

688
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:40,636
She blames me
for you not having called her.

689
00:45:40,669 --> 00:45:42,704
-What would I say?
-Tell her you miss her,

690
00:45:42,738 --> 00:45:44,573
that you're excited for her
to come home,

691
00:45:44,606 --> 00:45:47,209
that you can't wait
for us to be a family again.

692
00:45:47,243 --> 00:45:49,578
That would be selfish.

693
00:45:49,611 --> 00:45:51,247
-Why?
-If she's getting better there,

694
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,383
I don't know
why she'd come back here.

695
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:55,417
Well, she can't stay there
forever.

696
00:45:55,450 --> 00:45:57,786
Yeah, but maybe she'd be
happier somewhere else.

697
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:00,656
We talked about buying
that loft by the ballpark.

698
00:46:00,689 --> 00:46:03,225
No, no, I mean like a divorce.

699
00:46:06,495 --> 00:46:08,330
What I'm trying to say, Clark,

700
00:46:08,363 --> 00:46:11,266
is that I'm judged not only as
a husband, but also as a father,

701
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,470
and I can only be as good
of a father as you are a son.

702
00:46:14,504 --> 00:46:17,307
Well, if I'm honest, I don't
think I can be a very good son

703
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:19,508
right now.

704
00:46:19,542 --> 00:46:22,479
I never wanted to be the kind
of dad to make a lot of rules,

705
00:46:22,511 --> 00:46:25,314
but when I see start
to lose your way,

706
00:46:25,347 --> 00:46:27,550
I have a responsibility
to get you back on track.

707
00:46:27,582 --> 00:46:29,285
What makes you think
I'm off-track?

708
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:32,222
Where were you last night?

709
00:46:33,689 --> 00:46:35,725
At my girlfriend's.

710
00:46:35,758 --> 00:46:37,694
What, they just let you
sleep over?

711
00:46:37,727 --> 00:46:40,263
Yeah, when I told them
about you and Mom,

712
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:41,830
I think they kinda felt bad.

713
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,768
You're a mean-spirited
little shit, you know that?

714
00:46:45,801 --> 00:46:48,471
I know you feel that way.

715
00:46:48,504 --> 00:46:49,839
Yeah...

716
00:46:49,872 --> 00:46:53,209
Think I found two people
who don't.

717
00:46:53,242 --> 00:46:55,745
I got a feeling that
when they figure you out,

718
00:46:55,778 --> 00:46:57,680
they're not gonna want you
around anymore.

719
00:47:30,879 --> 00:47:32,314
Mr. Becker?

720
00:47:51,466 --> 00:47:53,269
-Hi, Etta.
-Hi.

721
00:47:53,903 --> 00:47:56,638
-Do you know why you're here?
-Not really.

722
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,407
The essay you handed in
you didn't write.

723
00:47:59,908 --> 00:48:01,577
What do you mean?

724
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:02,913
You plagiarized it
from the Internet.

725
00:48:03,778 --> 00:48:05,747
Did you think I didn't know
about the Internet?

726
00:48:05,781 --> 00:48:08,718
I thought maybe
you just wouldn't care.

727
00:48:08,751 --> 00:48:10,252
What does that mean?

728
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,757
Y... you know, you're...
like a cool young guy.

729
00:48:15,790 --> 00:48:18,560
So I wouldn't care
if you cheated?

730
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:22,965
I thought that since the
whole theme of your class

731
00:48:22,999 --> 00:48:27,270
is that nothing external
can inflict as much pain

732
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:29,272
on a person as a person
inflicts on themself,

733
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:32,309
it... it might be
enough that I feel bad.

734
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:37,446
If I don't report this,
I could lose my job.

735
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:41,251
My parents are getting
divorced.

736
00:48:41,283 --> 00:48:43,819
So did mine.

737
00:48:43,852 --> 00:48:46,923
And I took it as an opportunity
to get lost in literature.

738
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,659
-Where would you read?
-At the library.

739
00:48:52,327 --> 00:48:54,296
Right, but by the time
volleyball's over,

740
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:56,566
the library's closed.
Then go to a cafe.

741
00:48:56,598 --> 00:48:58,801
I don't know
of any good ones.

742
00:48:58,834 --> 00:49:00,971
That's not my problem, Etta.

743
00:49:04,839 --> 00:49:07,809
Look, I'm having
a really hard time.

744
00:49:07,843 --> 00:49:10,547
Just... please give me
another chance.

745
00:49:14,350 --> 00:49:16,353
You didn't hand this in.

746
00:49:17,519 --> 00:49:18,920
Thank you.

747
00:49:18,953 --> 00:49:22,959
Kelly's Cafe
in Selma is open 24 hours.

748
00:49:22,992 --> 00:49:24,426
Okay.

749
00:49:24,459 --> 00:49:25,961
So I'm there writing
most nights.

750
00:49:25,995 --> 00:49:27,998
Alright, thank you.

751
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,470
try and finalize the deal.

752
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:37,973
We're having some people
over on the 4th,

753
00:49:38,006 --> 00:49:39,809
so I hope you can make it.

754
00:49:39,841 --> 00:49:41,877
Okay, love. Bye.

755
00:49:44,379 --> 00:49:45,881
Here you go.

756
00:49:49,417 --> 00:49:50,819
If I'm in your way,
let me know.

757
00:49:50,852 --> 00:49:52,488
You're fine here for now.

758
00:49:53,722 --> 00:49:56,558
So, guys, in order for me
to feel comfortable

759
00:49:56,591 --> 00:49:58,994
with this arrangement,
I'm going to need you

760
00:49:59,028 --> 00:50:02,365
to stay down here and you
to stay up there after, say,

761
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:05,635
10 p.m.
Totally understand. Yeah.

762
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:07,336
Natty?

763
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,905
Me, too.

764
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:12,408
Thanks, Veronica.

765
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:36,765
<i>At approximately 7:15 a.m.
on Tuesday, September 14, 1999,</i>

766
00:50:36,798 --> 00:50:39,634
<i>Barnabas Q. entered Control Room
B of the Oceanside Waste Water</i>

767
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:42,704
<i>Treatment Plant and sat at his
desk and turned on his computer.</i>

768
00:50:42,738 --> 00:50:44,941
<i>It was his three-thousandth day
at the job</i>

769
00:50:44,973 --> 00:50:47,809
<i>and today was supposed to be
the day that he quit.</i>

770
00:50:47,843 --> 00:50:49,578
<i>Nothing theatrical,
no fireworks.</i>

771
00:50:49,611 --> 00:50:51,580
<i>He would spare his colleagues
his honest feelings</i>

772
00:50:51,613 --> 00:50:53,582
<i>about the quality
of their work and character,</i>

773
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,384
<i>and so spare himself
their honest feelings</i>

774
00:50:55,417 --> 00:50:57,586
<i>about the quality of his work
and his character.</i>

775
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,589
<i>"It is just time for me,
in my own life,</i>

776
00:50:59,622 --> 00:51:01,991
<i>to move on to other things,"
he was going to say.</i>

777
00:51:15,470 --> 00:51:18,774
<i>But by 7:24 a.m., Barnabas Q.
Had not only failed to quit,</i>

778
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:20,943
<i>he had accepted an assignment
his boss emailed,</i>

779
00:51:20,975 --> 00:51:23,011
<i>which Q thought would only
take him the morning,</i>

780
00:51:23,044 --> 00:51:25,447
<i>but ended up taking him
the rest of his life.</i>

781
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:26,982
Hi.

782
00:51:28,117 --> 00:51:31,086
-Hey.
-Mind if I sit here?

783
00:51:34,055 --> 00:51:36,091
how about one of these?

784
00:51:37,126 --> 00:51:38,995
Okay.

785
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:04,020
-Thank you.
-No problem.

786
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:09,285
-She know you're living here?
-I don't know.

787
00:53:09,318 --> 00:53:11,086
When did you talk to her last?

788
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:14,958
Not since she left.

789
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:19,928
Maybe you should take it?

790
00:53:24,098 --> 00:53:26,167
<i>-Hello.
-Hey! How are you?</i>

791
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,570
-Natty?
-Yeah.

792
00:53:28,604 --> 00:53:30,205
I'm sorry.

793
00:53:30,238 --> 00:53:31,941
Bedtime.

794
00:53:34,109 --> 00:53:36,112
<i>-Are you there?
-Yep.</i>

795
00:53:36,144 --> 00:53:38,747
<i>-What's been going on?
-Nothing, just school.</i>

796
00:53:38,781 --> 00:53:41,918
<i>How are things with Etta?</i>

797
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:44,553
Good. They're good.

798
00:53:44,586 --> 00:53:46,255
Yeah?

799
00:53:47,789 --> 00:53:52,594
So... lots of interesting people
here.

800
00:53:52,627 --> 00:53:55,597
<i>I think that you would find
their stories fascinating.</i>

801
00:53:55,631 --> 00:53:58,100
<i>Very different experiences,</i>

802
00:53:58,133 --> 00:54:00,669
different from the people
that I find at home.

803
00:54:02,271 --> 00:54:04,573
<i>Clark?
Yeah.</i>

804
00:54:04,606 --> 00:54:06,074
Where are you?

805
00:54:10,278 --> 00:54:12,347
I'm at home.

806
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:14,350
I miss you.

807
00:54:14,383 --> 00:54:16,252
<i>So much.</i>

808
00:54:16,285 --> 00:54:18,154
Okay, bye.

809
00:54:41,843 --> 00:54:43,979
-Okay, I've got one.
-Yeah.

810
00:55:28,057 --> 00:55:30,859
I'll take this.

811
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:32,861
-Do you want me to?
-No, no, I got it.

812
00:55:34,729 --> 00:55:37,032
Come on, Gus. Come on, Gus.

813
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:47,709
Todd, would you
bring me a glass of water

814
00:55:47,743 --> 00:55:50,279
on your way back up, please?
Yeah.

815
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:54,349
<i>scattered
quickly, each to his own house,</i>

816
00:55:54,383 --> 00:55:58,053
<i>while the suitors strolled back
to King Odysseus' palace.</i>

817
00:55:58,086 --> 00:56:01,222
<i>Telemachus, walking the beach
now, far from others,</i>

818
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:03,359
<i>washed his hands
in the foaming surf</i>

819
00:56:03,392 --> 00:56:07,864
<i>"Dear god, hear me!"</i>

820
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:10,732
-Clark?
-Yeah.

821
00:56:10,765 --> 00:56:13,101
-Do you know where Gus is?
-I have him.

822
00:56:20,975 --> 00:56:23,378
You have to let somebody know
if you're going to take him.

823
00:56:23,412 --> 00:56:25,747
I thought... I thought
he could use a walk.

824
00:56:25,781 --> 00:56:28,117
I, also wanted to get
some stuff for the house.

825
00:56:50,439 --> 00:56:53,341
When's your flight?
Midnight.

826
00:56:53,374 --> 00:56:57,412
What's the book about?
If you don't mind me asking.

827
00:56:57,446 --> 00:56:59,015
Malaysia, mostly.

828
00:57:00,149 --> 00:57:02,984
Natalia told me that your last
book was about Burma.

829
00:57:28,176 --> 00:57:30,445
Friday should be fun.
You know, the party?

830
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:32,781
Shit, I have to get wine.

831
00:57:32,814 --> 00:57:35,150
No, no, I can... I can pick up
something for you

832
00:57:35,184 --> 00:57:36,819
while you're away.
In what world, darling?

833
00:57:36,852 --> 00:57:39,421
I'll just go now.
Can I come with you?

834
00:57:39,453 --> 00:57:41,323
Natalia will be home
any second.

835
00:57:41,356 --> 00:57:43,459
No, it's fine. I should
probably give her some space

836
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:44,926
after practice anyways.

837
00:57:47,028 --> 00:57:49,030
Clark, honey?

838
00:57:49,064 --> 00:57:51,332
Can I pitch in?

839
00:57:51,365 --> 00:57:53,201
No, when somebody's paying
for something,

840
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:55,069
it's rude to stand so close.

841
00:57:55,102 --> 00:57:56,805
Well, don't be ashamed.

842
00:57:56,839 --> 00:57:59,041
I think it's nice that
you splurge on your guests.

843
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:04,213
-Have a good night.
-You, too.

844
00:58:11,053 --> 00:58:12,555
Have you read this yet?

845
00:58:12,588 --> 00:58:15,356
No, but your parents'
books are much better

846
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,092
than the ones Mr. Becker's
been assigning.

847
00:58:17,124 --> 00:58:18,860
-Babe?
-Yeah?

848
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:20,863
Better get going if you're
gonna make your flight.

849
00:58:20,896 --> 00:58:22,131
Okay.

850
00:58:22,164 --> 00:58:24,133
Todd talked to your dad today.

851
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:27,102
Todd wouldn't have invited him
to the party, would he?

852
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:29,338
-I don't know.
-I really hope not.

853
00:58:29,370 --> 00:58:31,307
That would be embarrassing
for him

854
00:58:31,339 --> 00:58:33,341
in front of
your parents' friends.

855
00:58:33,374 --> 00:58:35,276
Bye, guys. Be right back.

856
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:36,612
If the dancing girls come,

857
00:58:36,644 --> 00:58:39,514
tell them I said go ahead
and start a bath.

858
00:58:39,548 --> 00:58:41,082
-Hey, Todd?
-Yeah.

859
00:58:41,115 --> 00:58:44,252
You wouldn't have happened
to invite my dad

860
00:58:44,285 --> 00:58:46,387
to your cocktail party,
would you?

861
00:58:46,421 --> 00:58:47,623
It didn't occur to me.

862
00:58:47,656 --> 00:58:49,892
Okay, just checking.

863
00:58:49,925 --> 00:58:51,926
I did tell him Natalia had
a tournament this weekend,

864
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:54,329
so he should be expecting you.
You didn't tell me that.

865
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,068
-Bye, Natty.
-Bye, Mom.

866
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,035
-I love you.
-Love you.

867
00:59:01,068 --> 00:59:02,537
-Bye, Clark.
-Safe travels.

868
00:59:02,571 --> 00:59:06,275
Come on. Okay, guys.
Let's go, let's go.

869
00:59:06,307 --> 00:59:08,910
-Behave, you two.
-Be back in a few, guys!

870
00:59:19,453 --> 00:59:23,124
So... I've been thinking more
about sex.

871
00:59:24,126 --> 00:59:26,361
Would you mind if I stayed
here while you're away?

872
00:59:26,394 --> 00:59:29,931
Could you ask your mom
if that's okay?

873
00:59:32,466 --> 00:59:33,935
Maybe when she gets back.

874
00:59:33,968 --> 00:59:36,137
It'll be hectic
with the party.

875
00:59:37,606 --> 00:59:39,575
I could call her tomorrow,

876
00:59:39,607 --> 00:59:42,611
but she doesn't usually
respond well to me being pushy.

877
00:59:47,481 --> 00:59:50,952
so do you think
you're ready?

878
00:59:50,986 --> 00:59:53,321
Yeah, I think so.

879
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,492
Are you?

880
00:59:56,524 --> 01:00:00,963
Yeah. It'll feel good to be
that close to each other.

881
01:00:02,631 --> 01:00:06,002
-Yeah.
-I will get a condom.

882
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:02,390
-Will that fit?
-Why wouldn't it?

883
01:02:29,144 --> 01:02:31,312
-Clark?
-Yeah?

884
01:02:32,481 --> 01:02:34,783
Were you planning
on coming back up?

885
01:02:34,816 --> 01:02:37,586
I promised your mom
we weren't gonna share a bed.

886
01:02:37,618 --> 01:02:39,722
Todd wouldn't say anything.

887
01:02:41,323 --> 01:02:44,060
I'm just kind of towing
a very delicate line here.

888
01:02:47,796 --> 01:02:49,832
I'm just trying
to understand...

889
01:02:49,865 --> 01:02:51,533
Natalia, I love you, okay?

890
01:02:53,468 --> 01:02:55,671
I just don't wanna fuck anything
up.

891
01:03:39,214 --> 01:03:41,817
Hey, Todd?
I've been meaning to ask.

892
01:03:41,850 --> 01:03:43,886
I'd love to buy
one of your prints.

893
01:03:43,919 --> 01:03:47,223
-I'd be happy to give you one.
-Really? Thank you.

894
01:03:51,325 --> 01:03:54,896
-Hey, did you call your dad?
-No.

895
01:03:54,930 --> 01:03:57,366
Is it too late?

896
01:03:57,399 --> 01:03:58,700
Yeah.

897
01:03:58,732 --> 01:04:00,702
You know, I was thinking
on the ride home

898
01:04:00,734 --> 01:04:03,671
it might be nice
to invite him to the party.

899
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:06,908
Or dinner?
Or to something?

900
01:04:06,941 --> 01:04:09,243
Yeah, I was thinking
about the same thing,

901
01:04:09,276 --> 01:04:11,612
but I sort of came
to the opposite conclusion.

902
01:04:11,646 --> 01:04:14,216
You know, I don't have
all the facts, but,

903
01:04:14,249 --> 01:04:16,285
from my conversation with him,
it seems like

904
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:17,886
he wants to be
a part of your life.

905
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,756
Yeah, but he's really never
found a healthy way

906
01:04:20,789 --> 01:04:23,158
to be a part of anybody's life.

907
01:04:28,263 --> 01:04:29,731
Alright, buddy.

908
01:04:29,763 --> 01:04:33,434
I'm gonna enjoy
a little quiet time now.

909
01:05:42,636 --> 01:05:44,006
Come on.

910
01:05:45,339 --> 01:05:47,508
I can take
the next eight in line.

911
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:51,046
Next.

912
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:54,048
I'm... I'm actually
still waiting on my guest.

913
01:05:54,082 --> 01:05:56,818
I can only give one ticket
to each person in line.

914
01:05:56,850 --> 01:05:58,787
any chance
you'd be willing to part

915
01:05:58,819 --> 01:06:00,488
with your ticket?

916
01:06:00,522 --> 01:06:03,359
I've been looking forward
to this all year. Sorry.

917
01:06:04,859 --> 01:06:06,962
It was worth a shot.

918
01:06:06,995 --> 01:06:08,830
Thank you.

919
01:06:08,863 --> 01:06:10,366
Thank you.

920
01:06:22,743 --> 01:06:25,881
-Am I too late?
-It's sold out.

921
01:06:25,914 --> 01:06:28,316
Sorry,
I got held up at the hotel.

922
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:29,985
My sister got rejected
from Sarah Lawrence

923
01:06:30,017 --> 01:06:32,853
and is freaking out because
she thinks it's the only place

924
01:06:32,886 --> 01:06:34,890
she can be comfortably lesbian.

925
01:06:36,557 --> 01:06:38,693
So are we going to Kelly's?

926
01:06:38,727 --> 01:06:42,698
I'm trying to get some
distance from the manuscript.

927
01:06:42,731 --> 01:06:47,368
okay. Well, I think
I might just head there anyway.

928
01:06:47,401 --> 01:06:49,671
Maybe you could give me a ride?

929
01:06:55,709 --> 01:06:58,012
Are you a big fan of Eggers?

930
01:06:58,046 --> 01:07:00,348
Yeah, he's not my favourite.

931
01:07:11,426 --> 01:07:14,029
-Veronica.
-Thank you.

932
01:07:27,075 --> 01:07:30,611
Veronica? Hon?

933
01:07:33,615 --> 01:07:35,417
-Hey.
-Hey.

934
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:38,053
-You look nice.
-Thanks.

935
01:07:38,086 --> 01:07:40,789
Gonna get outta your way
so you can go talk to your mom.

936
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:49,765
-Mom?
-Yeah.

937
01:07:49,798 --> 01:07:52,968
How do you feel about Clark
staying the weekend?

938
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:55,804
-With you away?
-Yeah.

939
01:07:57,104 --> 01:07:59,774
We've been very generous,
but I can't in good conscience

940
01:07:59,807 --> 01:08:02,743
explain to Clark's father
that his son is staying with us

941
01:08:02,776 --> 01:08:04,178
while you're out of town.

942
01:08:04,211 --> 01:08:06,480
Do we actually owe his dad
an explanation?

943
01:08:06,513 --> 01:08:09,950
As to the whereabouts of
his child? Yes, Natalia, we do.

944
01:08:09,984 --> 01:08:12,187
Mo... Tell him he's happy
here.

945
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:14,156
-Is he?
-I think so.

946
01:08:14,189 --> 01:08:15,656
Are you?

947
01:08:16,824 --> 01:08:18,592
Yeah.

948
01:08:18,626 --> 01:08:20,462
Perhaps you should think
on that before picking a fight

949
01:08:20,494 --> 01:08:22,863
you may not want to win.
I'm not picking a fight.

950
01:08:22,896 --> 01:08:24,432
It feels awfully soon

951
01:08:24,466 --> 01:08:26,535
for you to be living
with your boyfriend.

952
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:31,140
How long after Dad died were
you and Todd living together?

953
01:08:32,507 --> 01:08:34,709
-Excuse me?
-Five weeks?

954
01:08:34,742 --> 01:08:36,077
It was not five weeks.

955
01:08:36,110 --> 01:08:38,113
Eight? Twelve?

956
01:08:38,145 --> 01:08:40,080
Within three months,
he was living here.

957
01:08:40,114 --> 01:08:42,484
All I'm asking is for you
to be a decent host

958
01:08:42,516 --> 01:08:43,684
to my boyfriend for two nights.

959
01:09:17,185 --> 01:09:19,654
Russia has been around
for millennia.

960
01:09:19,686 --> 01:09:21,222
We know who we are.

961
01:09:21,256 --> 01:09:22,923
Middle East's
as old as it gets

962
01:09:22,957 --> 01:09:24,693
and there's no more
unstable place in the world.

963
01:09:24,726 --> 01:09:26,862
I'm gonna have to agree
with Todd on this one.

964
01:09:26,895 --> 01:09:30,699
Age doesn't bring wisdom, just
stretch marks and cellulite.

965
01:09:30,731 --> 01:09:32,501
How old are you, Daria?

966
01:09:34,202 --> 01:09:36,137
Let me get you a drink, Daria.

967
01:09:44,078 --> 01:09:46,181
What brings you
to the States?

968
01:09:46,213 --> 01:09:48,115
I am visiting artist friend.

969
01:09:48,149 --> 01:09:50,084
Cool. What medium
does he work in?

970
01:09:50,118 --> 01:09:51,953
Flesh.

971
01:09:51,985 --> 01:09:53,687
What?

972
01:09:53,721 --> 01:09:56,191
She explores the stigma
surrounding plastic surgery

973
01:09:56,223 --> 01:09:57,659
and prostheses.

974
01:09:57,691 --> 01:09:59,627
My mom always wanted
a new nose.

975
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:01,596
Have you had any work done?

976
01:10:01,628 --> 01:10:03,631
'Cause... 'cause you look...
really great.

977
01:10:03,664 --> 01:10:07,068
Veronica, the boy wants
to know if my tits are fake.

978
01:10:07,101 --> 01:10:10,805
He's a very verbal boy.
Come in for a drink.

979
01:10:24,785 --> 01:10:27,087
<i>Hey, it's Clark.
Leave a message.</i>

980
01:10:28,690 --> 01:10:30,592
-I hate that building.
-I knew it.

981
01:10:30,624 --> 01:10:33,093
-Did you get enough to eat?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

982
01:10:33,127 --> 01:10:35,030
and the whole building
will turn green.

983
01:10:35,062 --> 01:10:37,198
I guess it'll look like shit
until then.

984
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:38,966
-Exactly.
-What are they talking about?

985
01:10:38,999 --> 01:10:41,002
You wanna go upstairs?

986
01:10:41,034 --> 01:10:43,939
It'd be kind of rude
to just sneak off.

987
01:10:43,971 --> 01:10:45,873
I don't think
anyone really cares.

988
01:10:45,906 --> 01:10:48,075
She's become
quite a pretentious snob.

989
01:10:48,109 --> 01:10:49,177
Clark?

990
01:10:51,044 --> 01:10:53,882
Clark.
Did you invite him?

991
01:11:06,293 --> 01:11:09,830
-What are you doing here?
-It's time to come home.

992
01:11:09,864 --> 01:11:12,033
You weren't even invited.

993
01:11:12,065 --> 01:11:14,868
Yes, I was.

994
01:11:14,901 --> 01:11:16,171
Yeah? By who?

995
01:11:16,204 --> 01:11:17,939
Pack your stuff.

996
01:11:17,971 --> 01:11:21,609
-I think you should go.
-Pack your shit, Clark.

997
01:11:21,642 --> 01:11:24,212
-Please keep your voice down.
-I'll give you two minutes

998
01:11:24,244 --> 01:11:25,879
to say your goodbyes

999
01:11:25,913 --> 01:11:27,882
and let these people know
it's time to come home!

1000
01:11:27,914 --> 01:11:29,350
-Don't embarrass yourself.
-You're coming home.

1001
01:11:29,383 --> 01:11:31,019
Tomorrow I'm taking you
to visit your mother!

1002
01:11:31,052 --> 01:11:32,687
Don't you fucking shush me!

1003
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,954
You're pathetic.
You look pathetic.

1004
01:11:33,988 --> 01:11:35,656
You're coming home
with your father

1005
01:11:35,690 --> 01:11:37,158
right this fucking minute!

1006
01:11:37,190 --> 01:11:39,760
That place is not my home
and you're not my father.

1007
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:41,296
You don't even know
how to live.

1008
01:11:41,329 --> 01:11:43,398
You don't know shit
about shit!

1009
01:11:43,431 --> 01:11:46,001
And I hope to God
someday you are cursed

1010
01:11:46,034 --> 01:11:48,337
with a little
cunt son like yourself!

1011
01:12:03,051 --> 01:12:06,421
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1012
01:12:06,454 --> 01:12:07,789
-Clark...
-What?

1013
01:12:07,821 --> 01:12:09,356
I'm sorry.

1014
01:12:09,390 --> 01:12:12,026
No, don't be.
Really, it's cool.

1015
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:15,397
-Sh-should we call your mom?
-About what?

1016
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,767
I mean...

1017
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,869
When does she come home?

1018
01:12:20,901 --> 01:12:24,705
I-I don't know. What sane
person would go home to that?

1019
01:12:24,739 --> 01:12:27,375
Well, where else could she go?

1020
01:12:27,408 --> 01:12:29,010
She'll find something.

1021
01:12:29,043 --> 01:12:31,146
Maybe you should just...

1022
01:12:31,178 --> 01:12:34,281
I'm not really looking
for advice, okay?

1023
01:12:36,083 --> 01:12:37,818
Only trying to help.

1024
01:12:37,851 --> 01:12:41,122
I... I know you are.
It's just, being here's enough.

1025
01:12:44,926 --> 01:12:46,895
What are you gonna do
about this weekend?

1026
01:12:46,927 --> 01:12:50,898
well, I thought
it was okay with your mom

1027
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:52,400
if I stayed here.

1028
01:12:55,936 --> 01:12:57,738
That's what I'll do. I mean...

1029
01:12:59,140 --> 01:13:03,445
Nat?..Todd didn't invite
him, did he?

1030
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:06,381
I think he did.

1031
01:13:06,413 --> 01:13:08,248
Why would he do that?

1032
01:13:08,281 --> 01:13:11,386
I don't think he or my mom
really want you here.

1033
01:13:11,418 --> 01:13:13,887
What can't he do to your mom
when I'm around?

1034
01:13:13,921 --> 01:13:17,391
I just think there's...

1035
01:13:17,425 --> 01:13:19,794
Like, I'm pretty
low-maintenance.

1036
01:13:22,296 --> 01:13:24,365
Maybe you shouldn't be here.

1037
01:13:27,435 --> 01:13:29,404
I'll sleep on the couch
tonight,

1038
01:13:29,436 --> 01:13:31,205
and we can talk
about this in the morning.

1039
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:33,007
-I'm leaving in the morning.
-When you get back.

1040
01:13:33,039 --> 01:13:36,110
I don't... wanna come home
to you.

1041
01:13:36,144 --> 01:13:37,779
Why?

1042
01:13:39,312 --> 01:13:43,417
It just doesn't...
doesn't sound very nice and...

1043
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:45,921
I don't think you're very nice.

1044
01:14:45,378 --> 01:14:47,515
-Hello?
-Hey.

1045
01:14:49,516 --> 01:14:51,485
<i>What's going on?</i>

1046
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:54,489
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

1047
01:14:55,922 --> 01:14:57,858
How are you?

1048
01:14:57,891 --> 01:15:00,028
<i>-I'm okay.
-Where are you?</i>

1049
01:15:00,061 --> 01:15:01,596
<i>At a cafe.</i>

1050
01:15:01,628 --> 01:15:05,098
Could I, come and see you?

1051
01:15:08,535 --> 01:15:10,370
I'm on my way out.

1052
01:15:10,404 --> 01:15:12,507
No, no, just let me come
and see you first.

1053
01:15:12,539 --> 01:15:16,243
<i>Actually, what's the address?
My phone's about to die.</i>

1054
01:15:20,114 --> 01:15:22,050
Kelly's Cafe.

1055
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:24,252
<i>Between 6th and Brannan.
Okay, cool. Thanks.</i>

1056
01:15:27,421 --> 01:15:28,923
Hey!

1057
01:15:35,096 --> 01:15:37,265
-Declined.
-Just try again.

1058
01:15:41,569 --> 01:15:45,406
Hey, I'm so sorry. Can you spot
me 20 bucks for the taxi?

1059
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:47,441
I think my card was cancelled.

1060
01:15:52,113 --> 01:15:54,281
Great. Can you look at my stuff?
Thanks.

1061
01:16:12,967 --> 01:16:14,603
Sorry.

1062
01:16:19,973 --> 01:16:22,310
Am I holding you up?
Sort of.

1063
01:16:22,976 --> 01:16:25,445
You have to be up early
tomorrow, right,

1064
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:26,981
for your tournament?

1065
01:16:28,481 --> 01:16:30,385
I was crashing at Natalia's...

1066
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:32,654
but it was... it was time.

1067
01:16:36,489 --> 01:16:38,292
Where're you headed?

1068
01:16:38,325 --> 01:16:40,595
Mr. Becker said
I could spend the night.

1069
01:16:40,628 --> 01:16:43,498
He lives nearby.

1070
01:16:44,998 --> 01:16:46,466
So why are you here?

1071
01:16:46,499 --> 01:16:49,037
'Cause I wasn't sure
if it was a good idea.

1072
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:52,507
-But?
-But then I got pretty tired.

1073
01:16:52,539 --> 01:16:55,275
Wh-why don't you just go home?

1074
01:16:55,309 --> 01:16:57,979
My parents sold their house.

1075
01:16:58,012 --> 01:17:00,982
I've been sharing a hotel room
with my sister.

1076
01:17:01,015 --> 01:17:03,084
But she's pretty
much taken it over.

1077
01:17:03,117 --> 01:17:05,352
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

1078
01:17:09,656 --> 01:17:13,494
Is there... is there
something you wanted

1079
01:17:13,526 --> 01:17:16,364
to talk to me about?
Just wanted to see you.

1080
01:17:18,665 --> 01:17:21,035
-Well?
-That's it.

1081
01:17:31,311 --> 01:17:34,048
Any chance I could come
with you?

1082
01:17:55,703 --> 01:17:57,504
That's a lot of books.

1083
01:17:57,538 --> 01:18:01,542
Yeah, it's,
it's for a story I'm writing.

1084
01:18:01,574 --> 01:18:03,677
What are you writing
about?

1085
01:18:05,145 --> 01:18:09,750
How... how would you
describe it?

1086
01:18:09,784 --> 01:18:12,220
It's a love story?

1087
01:18:12,253 --> 01:18:15,189
about late capitalism.

1088
01:18:15,221 --> 01:18:18,158
Don't you wish you had the
patience to read all of those?

1089
01:18:18,191 --> 01:18:22,062
Yeah, well, the stuff worth
reading is usually a slog.

1090
01:18:22,096 --> 01:18:23,698
Yeah, but what you assign
is pretty fun.

1091
01:18:23,730 --> 01:18:26,066
Those are the hits.

1092
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:28,703
I figure if I can hook you guys
early

1093
01:18:28,735 --> 01:18:31,271
that maybe you'll dig
for the deep cuts later.

1094
01:18:35,443 --> 01:18:37,412
So just you here?

1095
01:18:37,445 --> 01:18:38,713
It's just me.

1096
01:18:38,745 --> 01:18:40,647
Did you decorate it yourself?

1097
01:18:40,681 --> 01:18:42,583
yeah.

1098
01:18:42,615 --> 01:18:45,619
It's good. You did a good job.
What do you think?

1099
01:18:45,653 --> 01:18:49,723
-Yeah, I like it.
-Reminds me of you.

1100
01:18:49,757 --> 01:18:53,394
It's... feels like,
you know, all your stuff.

1101
01:18:53,427 --> 01:18:56,597
Could I get you
a glass of water?

1102
01:18:56,629 --> 01:18:58,199
Sure, yeah.
Actually, you know...

1103
01:18:58,231 --> 01:19:01,468
I could do with a drink,
if that's okay with you.

1104
01:19:03,137 --> 01:19:06,307
-sure, yeah.
-Awesome.

1105
01:19:13,346 --> 01:19:16,450
Do you want any?
No. No, thank you.

1106
01:19:16,484 --> 01:19:19,687
-Etta?
-I'm okay.

1107
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:21,422
So have you been here
for a while?

1108
01:19:21,454 --> 01:19:25,126
-A few years.
-Where's the bathroom, Jake?

1109
01:19:25,159 --> 01:19:29,763
It's just...
it's right around...

1110
01:19:29,797 --> 01:19:31,399
Okay.

1111
01:19:58,525 --> 01:20:00,194
Ahem-hem.

1112
01:20:11,372 --> 01:20:13,540
She needed a place to stay.

1113
01:20:14,708 --> 01:20:16,711
No, it's nice
that you offered.

1114
01:20:21,214 --> 01:20:23,383
If you're not careful
with this information,

1115
01:20:23,417 --> 01:20:25,352
I could be fired.

1116
01:20:25,386 --> 01:20:26,754
Yeah, no, of course.

1117
01:20:30,391 --> 01:20:33,194
I'm gonna...

1118
01:20:33,226 --> 01:20:36,530
Okay. I'm gonna get
some work done,

1119
01:20:36,564 --> 01:20:38,833
but you guys can hang out
in here. That's cool.

1120
01:20:38,865 --> 01:20:40,568
Okay.

1121
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:41,736
Hey, Jake?

1122
01:20:41,769 --> 01:20:45,673
Can I crash on your couch?

1123
01:20:49,877 --> 01:20:52,213
I guess so.
Thank you.

1124
01:20:52,245 --> 01:20:55,315
And... and I guess
I'll sleep in your bed.

1125
01:20:55,348 --> 01:20:57,886
Yeah, okay.

1126
01:21:21,307 --> 01:21:22,842
You sure you don't want
a drink?

1127
01:21:22,876 --> 01:21:24,979
No, I don't wanna be tired
at my tournament tomorrow.

1128
01:21:25,012 --> 01:21:28,482
Right. Well, thanks for making
this happen, anyways.

1129
01:21:33,787 --> 01:21:35,789
-Good night, Clark.
-Good night.

1130
01:21:43,797 --> 01:21:46,467
I'm sorry...

1131
01:24:13,079 --> 01:24:14,748
<i>-Hello?
-Hi.</i>

1132
01:24:14,781 --> 01:24:16,016
<i>Clark!</i>

1133
01:24:16,048 --> 01:24:19,854
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1134
01:24:19,887 --> 01:24:23,857
I've been trying to reach you.
Where are you, sweetie?

1135
01:24:23,891 --> 01:24:27,061
I'm at Mr. Becker's apartment
with Etta.

1136
01:24:27,093 --> 01:24:31,098
<i>Mr. Becker, your teacher?
Tell me what's going on.</i>

1137
01:24:32,098 --> 01:24:37,105
I... I don't really know
what's going on.

1138
01:24:41,074 --> 01:24:45,745
they're in bed together,
so...

1139
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:47,815
Should you call her parents?

1140
01:24:49,115 --> 01:24:52,185
Well, should you...
should you knock?

1141
01:24:52,218 --> 01:24:54,821
<i>-She likes it.
-Honey, no.</i>

1142
01:24:54,855 --> 01:24:57,425
You... you go there
and you knock

1143
01:24:57,458 --> 01:24:59,560
and you see if she's okay.

1144
01:25:09,002 --> 01:25:10,504
<i>Clark?</i>

1145
01:25:12,506 --> 01:25:13,641
Clark?

1146
01:25:13,673 --> 01:25:16,843
Yeah, no, I-I'm still here.

1147
01:25:18,846 --> 01:25:21,149
<i>I'm happy to be hearing
your voice.</i>

1148
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:27,788
Does your dad know you're there?

1149
01:25:29,522 --> 01:25:30,990
Shit.

1150
01:25:31,024 --> 01:25:32,493
<i>Clark?</i>

1151
01:25:37,096 --> 01:25:39,499
-Everything okay?
-Yeah.

1152
01:25:39,533 --> 01:25:41,169
Okay.

1153
01:25:44,971 --> 01:25:46,473
She's sleeping.

1154
01:26:07,895 --> 01:26:10,131
Are you okay?

1155
01:26:11,565 --> 01:26:12,900
Yeah.

1156
01:26:14,568 --> 01:26:17,738
I think I'm gonna head out.
Do you wanna come?

1157
01:26:20,740 --> 01:26:22,510
No.

1158
01:27:00,113 --> 01:27:02,048
He's home.

1159
01:27:50,297 --> 01:27:52,667
So your call last night
scared me.

1160
01:27:54,167 --> 01:27:56,136
Yeah, sorry.

1161
01:27:56,168 --> 01:27:58,805
No, I-I'm glad you called.

1162
01:27:58,838 --> 01:28:00,640
But you scared me.

1163
01:28:00,673 --> 01:28:03,676
Yeah, you, kinda sounded
like you were out of breath,

1164
01:28:03,709 --> 01:28:06,346
like I just woke you up
from a bad dream.

1165
01:28:06,379 --> 01:28:09,182
Well...

1166
01:28:11,651 --> 01:28:13,988
it was a long night
for everybody.

1167
01:28:14,020 --> 01:28:17,724
Yeah. Where in the process
are you?

1168
01:28:19,025 --> 01:28:21,796
-Near the end.
-Yeah?

1169
01:28:22,863 --> 01:28:25,333
It's kind of scary to think
about coming home?

1170
01:28:29,035 --> 01:28:30,671
I'm...

1171
01:28:30,704 --> 01:28:32,340
I'm gonna wait in the car.

1172
01:28:37,377 --> 01:28:40,815
Well, it seems like you...
you like it here. It's helping.

1173
01:28:42,348 --> 01:28:44,619
I've missed you.

1174
01:29:43,510 --> 01:29:46,079
You want me to time you
around the block?

1175
01:29:46,113 --> 01:29:47,448
I'm okay.

1176
01:29:47,480 --> 01:29:50,083
Come on,
what was your best time?

1177
01:29:50,117 --> 01:29:52,386
A little over four minutes
when I was, like, 13.

1178
01:29:53,820 --> 01:29:55,756
Well, you think
you can beat that?

1179
01:29:55,788 --> 01:29:58,291
-I dunno. Probably.
-Give it a shot.

1180
01:30:00,293 --> 01:30:04,131
On your mark... get set... go!
