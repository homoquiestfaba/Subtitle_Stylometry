1
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,930
Yeah! Nice job! Nice pass!

2
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,311
<i>St. Francis High School
basketball phenom</i>

3
00:01:20,513 --> 00:01:22,811
Ty Crane,
who they recruited just last year,

4
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,177
is widely held as
the next LeBron James.

5
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:27,649
We simply know him
as "The Crane."

6
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,289
Come on.

7
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,899
Come on, y'all!
Timo, let's go man, come on.

8
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,337
Yeah, whatever.

9
00:02:00,153 --> 00:02:01,848
Where you at? Where you at?

10
00:02:03,022 --> 00:02:04,512
Pick him up! Pick him up!

11
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,124
- Hey, son.
- Hey.

12
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:13,560
Right here, right here.

13
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,327
- Blue ball!
- Good D, baby!

14
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:20,199
- Damn!
- What the hell are you doing, y'all?

15
00:02:20,406 --> 00:02:23,398
- You took three steps this way.
- Yo, I put my fist up, man.

16
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,942
Yo, homey, look where you're throwing
the ball, man. Damn.

17
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,444
- Get your man!
- I knew it. I knew it.

18
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:33,680
Yeah!

19
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,718
St. Francis is up by 22.

20
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,459
Stay out of my way, bitch.
I own you.

21
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,601
- Oh, hell no!
- Bitch!

22
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:51,702
Let's go! Let's go!

23
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,299
Oh, no. Come on, guys, stop that!

24
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,675
- Let me go!
- Hey! Hey!

25
00:03:01,447 --> 00:03:03,074
I'm good. Get off me!

26
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,949
Get off me, get off me!

27
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:07,413
That's it! Game's over!

28
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,853
Game's over!

29
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,421
Crane. Great game, great game.

30
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:15,685
Tell everyone out there what it
feels like to be the next LeBron James.

31
00:03:15,895 --> 00:03:19,456
LeBron James?
I'm the only Ty Crane.

32
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,963
All right, you heard it here first,
"the only Ty Crane."

33
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:27,669
Why do all the benchwarmers
always got something to say?

34
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,307
We watching the damn game,
that's why.

35
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:30,999
- You got a good view, huh?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,179
Ty Crane outscored
our whole team by himself.

37
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,745
- Wonder how that happened.
- We had nothing but 32 points.

38
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,849
I got 12 of them.
What did you get, Kenyon?

39
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,848
Just shut up, dog.
The Crane swooped down on you

40
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,180
and delivered a basket of beat-down.
He clowned you, dog.

41
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:45,118
- Yeah, you better shut the hell up.
- He had you on lock the whole game.

42
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,759
Lyle, why don't you shut your mouth
before I close it for good.

43
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:49,485
You didn't do shit either
the whole game.

44
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,664
What, homey?
I will slap the taste out your mouth!

45
00:03:51,864 --> 00:03:53,889
- Can we all just get along?
- Shut your little ass up!

46
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,159
- You didn't even play!
- That's what I'm talking about.

47
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:59,099
- Shay, pass the ball, dog!
- You got two points in 16 minutes,

48
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,466
- that's why coach got rid of your ass.
- Exactly!

49
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:04,108
Timo, you was in the whole time,
you never even touched the rock.

50
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,937
You didn't do shit.
You might as well...

51
00:04:06,145 --> 00:04:09,478
- Who was you passing the ball to?
- You were playing and didn't do shit!

52
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:19,457
Kenny Ray Carter, Richmond
High School all-American, 1972.

53
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,424
Good to see you, sir.

54
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,789
I was really happy to see you
in the stands tonight.

55
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:27,296
I have to tell you, sir,
I haven't made up my mind yet.

56
00:04:28,735 --> 00:04:31,499
As I've told you,
it's time for me to step down.

57
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,968
Last few years
have been really tough.

58
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,141
Well, losing's hard, sir.

59
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,278
This isn't about
losing games, Kenny.

60
00:04:41,547 --> 00:04:45,779
I can't get them to show up
for school, for practice.

61
00:04:46,252 --> 00:04:49,449
I can't get parents involved, and I'm
done chasing kids in the streets

62
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:51,146
and pulling them into the gym.

63
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,949
Yeah, it's a tough job.

64
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,320
Richmond is a tough little city.

65
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:58,959
When I saw you here tonight,
I thought, "I got him. He's in."

66
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:02,066
Well, actually,
I was here for another reason.

67
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,896
My son plays for St. Francis.

68
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:06,594
He does?

69
00:05:07,073 --> 00:05:09,803
- Which kid was he?
- Well, you didn't see him.

70
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:13,274
- He's a freshman. He didn't play.
- That's great. Great school.

71
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:15,975
What, you wanna go?

72
00:05:18,618 --> 00:05:20,518
- Hey!
- Lyle, bring it!

73
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,951
Let him go. You think everybody's
scared of you? I ain't scared of you!

74
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:28,491
Cruz, chill, man. Why you gotta be
trying to act all hard all the time, man?

75
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,126
God, I'm sick of you, man!

76
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,865
You know, that school was rough
when I went there.

77
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,560
It's way beyond that now.

78
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,467
Well, then, just forget about it.
Don't even discuss it again.

79
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:45,804
I can't quite do that. Coach officially
offered me the job tonight.

80
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,206
The clock's ticking.

81
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,280
And when you say "offering job,"
there's usually money involved.

82
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,850
Yeah, there might be
a thousand bucks in it for me.

83
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,452
For five months of work?

84
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:58,590
Oh, well, you can't say no to that.

85
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,089
And the team, it's so bad.

86
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:04,092
Those boys,
they're so angry and undisciplined.

87
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,231
And besides, you know,
you don't have the time.

88
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:07,922
You're trying to open up
a second store.

89
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,534
Exactly, I don't have the...
Hell, I don't have any time.

90
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,762
And you promised to take
your girlfriend to Mexico.

91
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:14,439
And I'm definitely
keeping that promise.

92
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,870
There's no way
I'm not going to Mexico

93
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:20,136
and hanging out on the beach
with you in your bikini.

94
00:06:20,346 --> 00:06:21,540
I can't take that job.

95
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,482
So when do you start?

96
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,922
- You should've spoken to me first.
- Why?

97
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:34,491
- It was a personal choice for me.
- So, what happens to me?

98
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:36,218
You still gonna come to my games?

99
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:39,262
I'll probably miss most of
your games, Damien. I'm sorry.

100
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:40,989
Then I'll go to Richmond
and play for you.

101
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,394
No.

102
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,229
Well, why not?

103
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:49,106
- Dad, you've always been my coach.
- This is a great school, Damien.

104
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,134
It puts you in a great position
for college.

105
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:52,777
Dad, I'm a freshman!

106
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,571
Just because I'm coaching
at Richmond,

107
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,249
it doesn't change our plans
for your future, all right?

108
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:27,306
Yo, my man, I need a vial, man.
You got that good dope? How much?

109
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,227
You forgot to bring your ID,
didn't you?

110
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,454
- I forgot it.
- Every day.

111
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,495
Good morning. Ken Carter.

112
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:53,504
- Thanks.
- Here you go, sir.

113
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,268
Hey, yo, what's up?

114
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,878
- Nice to see you again, Mr. Carter.
- You too, ma'am.

115
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:08,315
If the offer still stands,
I'd like to coach the team.

116
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,288
Well, I hope you're up for the task.
These young men need discipline.

117
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,027
The job comes with a $1,500 stipend

118
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:19,323
and a major time commitment
for the next four months.

119
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,529
- I accept.
- Great.

120
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:25,302
We're thrilled to have you.
Gentlemen, I hate to be abrupt,

121
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,700
but I do have a budget meeting
I need to run to.

122
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:30,034
Mr. Carter, is there anything
you need from us?

123
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:34,612
Well, I just need about
25 copies of this document.

124
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,480
- I'm all set.
- Ray, would you see to it

125
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,845
that Mr. Carter...?
Coach Carter gets these copies?

126
00:08:41,053 --> 00:08:43,521
- Will do.
- Gentlemen.

127
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,559
I'm not saying this is
not gonna be a challenge,

128
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,229
but, Kenny, you know the deal here.

129
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:54,422
Just keep in mind,
these are good boys.

130
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,898
Guys! Guys!

131
00:08:57,103 --> 00:08:58,695
Guys!

132
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:02,204
Now, as you know, I've been... Hey!

133
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:03,966
You know I've been looking
for a new coach

134
00:09:04,176 --> 00:09:06,303
to take over for me this season.

135
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,006
This is Ken Carter.
He went to Richmond.

136
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,741
He was a two-sport all-American.

137
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:16,251
Still holds records
for scoring, assists, steals.

138
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:19,891
Basketball scholarship to
George Mason University.

139
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,219
We're lucky to have Coach Carter.

140
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,420
Now, let's give him
the respect he's due.

141
00:09:25,631 --> 00:09:28,065
- They're all yours, coach.
- Thank you, sir.

142
00:09:31,537 --> 00:09:33,164
Good afternoon, young men.

143
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:38,241
As Coach White said, I'm your
new basketball coach, Ken Carter.

144
00:09:39,278 --> 00:09:41,212
I guess I need to speak louder
so you can hear me.

145
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,848
I'm Ken Carter,
your new basketball coach.

146
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:47,349
We hear you, dog.
But we can't see you.

147
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:49,043
The glare from your
big, black-ass head

148
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,223
is hella shiny, man.
Damn, do you buff it?

149
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,791
Oh, you got jokes to go along
with that ugly jump shot of yours, huh?

150
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,491
First of all, if you need to know
my credentials,

151
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:03,066
as Coach White said,
they're on the wall there behind you.

152
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:09,907
Secondly, if basketball practice
starts at 3, you are late as of 2:55.

153
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:14,672
You, shooting the ball.
What's your name, sir?

154
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,815
Jason Lyle, but I ain't no sir.

155
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:19,416
You're not a sir.

156
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,643
Well, are you a madam?

157
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:27,050
- Little bitch. Bitch.
- As of now, you are a sir.

158
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,954
So are the rest of you.

159
00:10:29,161 --> 00:10:31,721
"Sir" is a term of respect.

160
00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:35,492
And you will have my respect
until you abuse it.

161
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:40,129
Mr. Lyle, how many games
did you guys win last season?

162
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,464
Like four wins, 22 losses.

163
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,936
- Sir.
- Sir.

164
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,712
I'm going to give you contracts.

165
00:10:52,718 --> 00:10:56,552
If you sign and honor
your side of them,

166
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,917
we are going to be successful.

167
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,559
Damn, do I get a signing bonus
for signing this contract?

168
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:05,527
Yes, sir.
You get to become a winner.

169
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,698
Because if there's one thing I know,
it is this:

170
00:11:10,202 --> 00:11:12,636
The losing stops now.

171
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:17,167
Starting today, you will play
like winners, act like winners,

172
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:21,210
and most importantly,
you will be winners.

173
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:24,941
If you listen and learn,
you'll win basketball games.

174
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:28,444
And, gentlemen, winning in here...

175
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,151
...is the key to winning out there.

176
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,084
This contract states that you will
maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

177
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:38,126
You will attend all your classes

178
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,094
and you will sit in the front row
of those classes.

179
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,962
- Yo, this a country-ass nigga, dog.
- Excuse me.

180
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,832
- Did you say something, sir?
- Worm was wondering,

181
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,974
are you some country church nigga,
with your tie on and all that?

182
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:51,768
- Right.
- That's what you wanna say, right?

183
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:53,205
And what is your name, sir?

184
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,443
I'm Timo Cruz, sir.

185
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,842
Well, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Worm,

186
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:04,555
what you should both know
is we treat ourselves with respect.

187
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:06,190
We don't use the word "nigga."

188
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:08,292
Are you some preacher man
or some shit?

189
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:10,724
Because God ain't gonna do you
no good in this neighborhood.

190
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,023
- I live in this neighborhood, sir.
- Sir.

191
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,224
Can you believe
this uppity Negro, sir?

192
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:19,429
Okay, Mr. Cruz...

193
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:23,040
...leave the gym right now.
- For what?

194
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:27,076
I'll ask you one last time
to leave the gym

195
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,806
- before I help you leave.
- Before you what?

196
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,648
Do you even know who I am?

197
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:37,383
From what I can see, a very confused
and scared young man.

198
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,991
Scared of who? Scared of you?
I'm supposed to be scared of you?

199
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,261
Nigga, I ain't scared of nobody.
I will lay your ass out.

200
00:12:44,463 --> 00:12:45,725
I don't think so.

201
00:12:51,737 --> 00:12:53,227
All right.

202
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,143
What you doing? Get off me!

203
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,175
Teachers ain't supposed
to touch students.

204
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,182
I'm not a teacher.

205
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,779
I'm your new basketball coach.

206
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,666
This ain't over!

207
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:39,115
Is there anybody else
who's not feeling this contract?

208
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,717
Come on, man, where you going?

209
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,182
I don't do high school contracts.

210
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:48,860
Tell us when you need
the real ballers.

211
00:13:49,061 --> 00:13:51,154
I will do that, sir.

212
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:53,859
There goes our two leading scorers
from last season, man.

213
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,229
Then I guess we'll have new
leading scorers this season, huh?

214
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,268
Now, I cannot teach you the game
of basketball

215
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:05,466
until your conditioning is at a level
that allows me to do so.

216
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,841
Gentlemen, report to the baseline.

217
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:13,150
To the baseline!

218
00:14:20,559 --> 00:14:23,357
I presume you all know
what suicides are.

219
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:24,790
So...

220
00:14:32,771 --> 00:14:35,296
I saw the St. Francis game
the other night.

221
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,535
None of you have a problem
shooting the ball.

222
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,405
You all had a problem
getting up and down the court.

223
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,341
If you are late, you will run.

224
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:50,386
If you give me attitude,
you will do push-ups.

225
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,725
So you can push-up or shut up.

226
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:55,393
That's up to you.

227
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:58,025
- Yo, how many we gonna do?
- Sir.

228
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,725
Yo, sir, how many we gonna do?

229
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:06,997
Let's see how many you can do
in one hour and seven minutes.

230
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:10,574
Fellas, don't make me
commit homicide.

231
00:15:10,943 --> 00:15:14,310
I said, suicides!
Put your hand on the line!

232
00:15:14,513 --> 00:15:17,380
Put your hand on the line!

233
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:23,554
Damn, I can't keep this shit up, man.
I can barely walk.

234
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:27,214
- I know, my legs is hella sore, son.
- Need some Gatorade or something.

235
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:31,386
- There go your girl right there, son.
- Yeah.

236
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:34,157
Hey, what's with you and her homeys?
You gonna try to holler at them?

237
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:36,561
Man, I'm hollering
at both of the friends.

238
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,361
- Both of them?
- Yeah, because I need that.

239
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:41,562
You know, I need variety in my life.
I can't just have one girl.

240
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:43,139
You know what I'm saying?
I need both.

241
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,570
Hey.

242
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,039
- What's up, baby?
- How you doing?

243
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:49,408
Ladies, ladies, ladies. Y'all heard
about that two-for-one special, right?

244
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,513
Two of you, one of me.
Now, that's special.

245
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:57,415
- Please. Whatever, Worm.
- Yeah, special ed.

246
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,215
- Get your arm off me.
- I like this fox.

247
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:01,859
You working that chinchilla.
But, look, baby, me and you...

248
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:05,622
You need to tell him to stop playing it
so close. She don't even like him.

249
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:10,763
- Why not? Worm's the man.
- Worm is Worm.

250
00:16:13,372 --> 00:16:17,069
Anyway, I got something
for the baby today.

251
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:29,277
We don't even know if it's a baby yet.
I mean, it's kind of early.

252
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,183
You ain't even been
to the doctor yet.

253
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:35,451
Hello? I passed the pregnancy test,
Kenyon. Three times.

254
00:16:42,568 --> 00:16:45,696
- These are kind of cute, though.
- I know, I got good taste, right?

255
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,371
Yeah, all right.

256
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,568
Precious little shoes.

257
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,835
Well, I got a little
somethin'-somethin' for you too.

258
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:57,738
Thank you.

259
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,683
This definitely is a little something.

260
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:06,083
- Where'd you get this?
- Don't sleep on the 99 Cent Store.

261
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:08,821
Kenyon!

262
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,292
- What? What's up?
- What are you doing? Give me!

263
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:13,328
- Are you crazy?
- Are you crazy?

264
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,090
You got that for 99 cents?
I've been there.

265
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,235
You can get three brooms and a bucket
for 99 cents, with some toilet paper.

266
00:17:18,437 --> 00:17:21,372
That's like thread.
That's not even half a shoelace.

267
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,108
Well, would you like to see me
in this shoelace?

268
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,105
Quick feet! Let me see quick feet!

269
00:17:30,315 --> 00:17:33,011
Touch the floor! Stay big! Stay big!

270
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,846
Three push-ups and move.
One! Two! Three!

271
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,852
Let's go. Explode!

272
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,356
Let me hear you. Let me hear you!
Let me hear it.

273
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,755
Explode! Worm, explode!

274
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,327
Touch the floor! Touch the floor!

275
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:47,590
Give me five!
Just give me five! Push!

276
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,826
Push! Go! Go!
Let me hear you!

277
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:54,233
Come on, close out!
Explode! Let's go!

278
00:17:56,475 --> 00:17:58,534
Sir, you're 20 minutes late.

279
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:05,141
That's ten suicides for the
whole team, 250 push-ups for you.

280
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,783
This ain't the track team, man.

281
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,419
Nor is it the debate team, Mr. Lyle.

282
00:18:09,621 --> 00:18:11,111
But you're right.

283
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:15,459
And because you're right,
that's 20 suicides for the entire team

284
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:17,822
and you get the privilege
of joining Mr. Battle

285
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,863
- with 250 push-ups of your own.
- What, are you serious?

286
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:22,829
- Yeah.
- This is bullshit!

287
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,668
Good answer, Mr. Battle.

288
00:18:26,872 --> 00:18:28,396
Johnny, tell him what he's won.

289
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,040
Because you gave
such a good answer

290
00:18:30,242 --> 00:18:31,766
and you gave the coach attitude,

291
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:35,504
you win the bonus prize
of 500 push-ups!

292
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,950
And would you like to go
for the grand prize of a thousand?

293
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,381
No, sir.

294
00:18:43,922 --> 00:18:47,358
To the baseline!
On my whistle! Let's go!

295
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,356
J.B., come on, baby.

296
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:52,386
I can't even move, son.
Like, every muscle on my body hurts.

297
00:18:52,598 --> 00:18:55,533
- You can't say nothing to him.
- Why can't I say nothing to him?

298
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:58,025
I'm a white boy? Man, what the...?

299
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:01,328
Right here. Right here.
Get this dude right here. Get this dude.

300
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,698
Where you going, homey?
Where you going, huh?

301
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,069
- I ain't got shit.
- What?

302
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:07,745
Please don't shoot me, man.
Go on, take my bag, dog!

303
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,914
Run your shit, homey!

304
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,382
That's some bullshit, Cruz!

305
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:21,058
Yo, I'm gonna visit you in County, dog.

306
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,956
I'm just playing, B.
Look at you!

307
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:28,331
Damn! I seen y'all
walking from up the block

308
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,025
like somebody put a pipe
in your asses.

309
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,270
You all right, dog?

310
00:19:34,473 --> 00:19:36,100
Look, y'all wasn't winning with me,

311
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,833
but y'all damn sure
look sad without me.

312
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,103
But you know what?
I'm gonna watch y'all play.

313
00:19:41,313 --> 00:19:42,746
See y'all get your asses kicked.

314
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:47,248
Yo! I'd love to shoot the shit with
you bitches all night, but I gotta go.

315
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,747
- All right.
- Yo, who that, man?

316
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,684
That's my cousin, Renny.

317
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,448
I'm gonna check y'all.
Come on, let's go.

318
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:55,593
Yo, Worm, you need a ride?

319
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,159
- No, I'm straight, man.
- You sure?

320
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:59,193
- Yeah, I'm good.
- All right, my nigga.

321
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:01,593
- One love.
- All right, Lyle!

322
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,759
Don't let nobody else put a pipe
up your ass, or you might like it!

323
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:12,610
Hey, you was scared, huh?
I wasn't scared.

324
00:20:13,011 --> 00:20:15,502
The state only requires
that they have a 2.0 average to play.

325
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:17,204
Now, you got in here
they need a 2.3.

326
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,715
If you have a 2.0, you have to score
at least 1050 on the SAT

327
00:20:20,919 --> 00:20:23,444
to be eligible
for an athletic scholarship.

328
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,953
If you have a 2.3,
you only need 950.

329
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,820
Now, 2.3 is just a C-plus.

330
00:20:30,195 --> 00:20:33,028
It shouldn't be that hard
to maintain a C-plus.

331
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,593
These boys are student athletes.

332
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,796
"Student" comes first.

333
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,495
It says they gotta wear
coat and ties on game days.

334
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:44,232
They don't own ties!
You gonna supply the ties?

335
00:20:44,443 --> 00:20:46,502
There's a Goodwill
and a Salvation Army store

336
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,737
less than two blocks from here.

337
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,415
They got a box full of ties
for 50 cents apiece.

338
00:20:51,617 --> 00:20:53,482
Yo, man, what you
trying to say, huh?

339
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:57,146
Oh, we too good to shop at the
Goodwill and Salvation Army, is that it?

340
00:20:57,356 --> 00:20:59,756
- Yeah, I ain't that broke.
- This is crazy!

341
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:02,859
A dress code and they have to sit
in the front row in class?

342
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:07,828
- This is basketball, man!
- And basketball is a privilege, ma'am.

343
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,966
If you want to play basketball
on this team,

344
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,899
these are the simple rules
you have to follow

345
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:16,836
if you want to enjoy that privilege.

346
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:20,370
Now, if you decide
to follow these simple rules,

347
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,409
I need you and the boys
to sign this contract.

348
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:28,548
They can bring the contracts
to practice tomorrow.

349
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:30,654
If you come to practice.

350
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:34,049
I wanna thank you all for coming out
and showing your support,

351
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:37,160
and I hope I have your support
the rest of the season.

352
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,158
- Good night.
- Get up and leave like that?

353
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,596
Look, I have a hard enough time
getting my nephew to...

354
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,068
- How you gonna make them wear ties?
- I want the other coach back!

355
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:04,379
It's one of your contracts, sir.
I've amended that contract.

356
00:22:04,856 --> 00:22:07,848
You require your players
to maintain a 2.3 grade point average.

357
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,688
I've committed to maintaining a 3.5.

358
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:14,125
You require ten hours of community
service, and I've committed to 50.

359
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:18,531
Any unexcused absences, any other
disciplinary issues at school,

360
00:22:18,737 --> 00:22:21,900
you can nullify this agreement
and send me to any school you want.

361
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:26,143
And how many days do I have
to consider this offer?

362
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,710
None.

363
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,505
The second page
is a letter you need to sign

364
00:22:29,715 --> 00:22:31,808
that confirms my withdrawal
from St. Francis.

365
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,442
- They know I'm leaving.
- What?

366
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,178
- You withdrew from St. Francis?
- I called Richmond.

367
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,119
- They expect me there in the morning.
- You called Richmond?

368
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,322
You should have spoken to me
about this.

369
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,662
It was a personal choice for me.

370
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,392
Well, I can fix all that in the morning.

371
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:55,239
Sir, please listen.
All I wanna do is play for you.

372
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:57,465
If I'm one of the top students
at Richmond,

373
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:01,243
I mean one of the top in the whole
school, and I have great SATs,

374
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,778
I can go to any college
in the country.

375
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:06,547
I'm asking you to trust me.

376
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,920
You really wanna do this, huh?

377
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:17,985
Okay.

378
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,631
Part of growing up
is making your own decisions

379
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,630
and living with the consequences.

380
00:23:28,306 --> 00:23:30,831
3.7.

381
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:35,174
And you will earn every minute
of playing time.

382
00:23:38,483 --> 00:23:39,814
Open it, please.

383
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:42,243
Morning, sir.

384
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:49,356
<i>My name is J. Lyle
They call me wild</i>

385
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,354
<i>It's all right
Kenyon's mom tonight</i>

386
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,658
<i>- Say what?
- You might think I'm wrong</i>

387
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:58,065
<i>But she's got these thongs</i>

388
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:01,802
Hey, yo, yo, yo.
It's Malcolm X from St. Francis.

389
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,641
- Hey, yo, Malcolm!
- Whatever.

390
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,174
- What's up, man?
- What are you doing here, son?

391
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,940
- I transferred to Richmond.
- Oh, no, son, I think you're just lost.

392
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,616
Well, I am actually lost.
Can you tell me how to get to...?

393
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:16,117
Bel Air? Hey, yo, Worm,
tell your man Fresh Prince here

394
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,290
- how to get to his mansion.
- Fresh bitch.

395
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:26,391
I hope seeing you in this hallway mean
I get to see you on the court today.

396
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:31,693
I can't wait. With your five browns.

397
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,404
Everybody up.

398
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:39,803
Today we're going to play defense.

399
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:42,836
Sorry, sir.

400
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:47,016
Gentlemen, this is a new player,
Damien Carter.

401
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:49,952
He is my son, and he is late.

402
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:52,623
Sir, you owe me 20 suicides.

403
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,621
Sir, it's my first day of school,
I had to stay...

404
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,726
Basketball practice starts at 3.

405
00:24:57,095 --> 00:25:00,587
As of 2:55, you are late.
Get changed in the locker room.

406
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,701
Do your suicides on the far side
of the court so as not to disturb us.

407
00:25:04,903 --> 00:25:07,235
All right, gentlemen,
give me two lines!

408
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,901
Okay, young sirs, we're gonna
take it to the next level.

409
00:25:12,644 --> 00:25:15,272
Everything I knew about basketball,

410
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,371
I learned from women.

411
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,576
I have a sister, her name's Diane.

412
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:26,017
She was always on my case
about every little thing.

413
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,726
Matter of fact, she still is.

414
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,226
"Turn down that radio!
You eat the last piece of cake?

415
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,421
Did you drink all the Kool-Aid?"

416
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,927
She was always in my face.

417
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,295
So when I call "Diane,"

418
00:25:40,505 --> 00:25:44,168
we're gonna play straight
man-to-man pressure defense.

419
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,447
Worm! No, no, no, no, sir.

420
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,912
Look at your defensive posture.

421
00:25:53,118 --> 00:25:56,451
Come on. Split your man.
Back straight, butt down.

422
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,681
This hand guards against the passing
lane, this hand protects the crossover.

423
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,689
All right? Palms up!
Get your head in the game.

424
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:05,596
Now we have Delilah.

425
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,196
She was my childhood sweetheart.

426
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,799
Sir, was she hot?

427
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:14,597
Oh, yes, sir.
She was steaming hot.

428
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:20,376
But she was the devil.
That girl was evil.

429
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,680
I remember once she tricked me
into stealing brownies

430
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:27,283
from Christ the King
First Baptist Church bake sale.

431
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:29,643
She smiled
and got her way out of it,

432
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:32,618
while I damn near had to wear
a pillow on my butt

433
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:34,451
for a month
before I could sit down.

434
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,293
Delilah, gentlemen.
She's our trap defense.

435
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,926
Take notes, freshman. This is as
close as you gonna get to playing.

436
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,767
Come on, come on. Move, move!
Delilah! Delilah! Delilah!

437
00:26:56,681 --> 00:26:58,945
Now, I know you're all
concerned that

438
00:26:59,150 --> 00:27:01,380
we didn't work
on our offense during practice.

439
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:03,611
We have all season to do that.

440
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:07,121
But what did we do in practice,
Mr. Stone?

441
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,689
- Run.
- That's right.

442
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,419
So, what do you think I want you
to do on offense tonight?

443
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:15,026
- Run?
- Correct again.

444
00:27:15,233 --> 00:27:17,463
I want you to run.

445
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:22,800
<i>I want you to run every second
that clock is ticking, all game long.</i>

446
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,008
Put him back on the bench!

447
00:27:31,716 --> 00:27:35,482
Rebound! Rebound!
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

448
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:41,449
Nice pass, baby!

449
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,290
Push it! Push it!

450
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,960
- Screen.
- Screen, baby. Screen. Screen.

451
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:50,263
- Worm.
- Let's go, Worm.

452
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,242
Stay alert! Pick him up right there!

453
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,777
- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!
- What's the call, ref?

454
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:05,779
White four, fifth.
He's out of the game.

455
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,282
- Oh, ref, come...
- That's his fifth foul, coach.

456
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,386
- Time, sir.
- Time out, white.

457
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,079
Bad call, ref!
That was a jump ball, damn it!

458
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:14,883
- Time out, white.
- Come on, fellas.

459
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:17,653
Come on, huddle up. Hustle up.
Get over here.

460
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:19,227
All right. Huddle up, huddle up.

461
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,423
- Carter, you're in.
- But, coach, he a freshman.

462
00:28:22,634 --> 00:28:24,363
You wanna coach?

463
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,267
All right, take a deep breath, guys.
Come on, deep breaths.

464
00:28:29,307 --> 00:28:31,104
- You tired?
- No, sir.

465
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,104
Those guys are exhausted.

466
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:35,176
That's why this guy's gonna miss
that free throw.

467
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,406
When he does,
Worm and Lyle are our first option.

468
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:41,949
Push the ball. Go hard to the hole.
Everybody attack the boards, got that?

469
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:44,280
- Yes, sir.
- All right, Richmond on three.

470
00:28:44,789 --> 00:28:46,416
- One, two, three!
- Richmond!

471
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,252
- All right, let's out, all right?
- Step it up, let's go!

472
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,326
Look alive out there.

473
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,925
All right, guys, you're in better shape
than they are. Push it.

474
00:28:58,136 --> 00:28:59,728
Box out, box out.

475
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,303
One shot.

476
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:09,610
Kenyon, right here. Kenyon!

477
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,542
- Come on! Come on!
- Come on, baby!

478
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:21,625
All right.

479
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,523
Kenyon!

480
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,899
- Worm!
- Yo, yo.

481
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:34,970
Oh, yeah!

482
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:38,532
Yeah! That's what I'm talking about!

483
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:49,451
- Tight pass, baby. Nice pass, dog.
- It was all you.

484
00:29:49,654 --> 00:29:50,951
A win like that don't mean nothing,

485
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:52,748
because they can't play anyway,
you feel me?

486
00:29:56,194 --> 00:30:00,290
Okay, Shaq, so you dominated
down low tonight. Any thoughts?

487
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,295
I dropped a 20-piece.
Kobe played his game.

488
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:06,663
We the champions
till we ain't the champions no more.

489
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:09,669
- Junior Battle.
- Undefeated until...

490
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,603
Yo, man, on the real,

491
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,675
that was the worst game
I've ever seen in my life.

492
00:30:13,878 --> 00:30:16,346
I thought that shit would never end.
I was dying in the bleachers.

493
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,516
That's right, you were in
the bleachers, weren't you?

494
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:20,274
We were on the court
handling our business.

495
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,715
That's right. We 1-0, bitch.

496
00:30:22,921 --> 00:30:26,516
Yo, on the real, Hercules is weak, B,
and y'all barely beat them.

497
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,589
Damn, Timo,
why you throwing salt, man?

498
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:31,455
We undefeated. Show us love, son.

499
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,528
Yeah, that's right, we undefeated.

500
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,722
I'll knock all y'all off.

501
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:09,827
- Yo. I'll check y'all later, all right?
- All right.

502
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,594
Yo. Let's do this.

503
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:21,876
- What's up?
- Here's two bundles.

504
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,844
- All right.
- Yo, be careful. The block is hot.

505
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,573
Yo, I got you.

506
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,020
- How you doing, man?
- Chilling, man.

507
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,086
You look good.

508
00:31:32,423 --> 00:31:33,617
Got some paper for you.

509
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,185
Now we're talking, yeah.

510
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,760
How you living, Timo?

511
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,100
I'm good.

512
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,832
- You all right? For real?
- Yeah.

513
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,176
- Here, take some.
- I'm all right.

514
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:56,347
No, no, no, take some, please.

515
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,349
You did good, man.
You're doing good, bro.

516
00:32:02,053 --> 00:32:04,078
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me, thank you.

517
00:32:04,289 --> 00:32:05,881
You earned it.

518
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,255
Take a nickel bag, okay?

519
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:14,528
Go get yourself something, man.

520
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,160
- I'm gonna see you?
- Yeah, next week.

521
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,496
Okay, I'm gonna see you.

522
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,239
- Keep it up.
- Yeah.

523
00:32:41,192 --> 00:32:43,057
<i>Hey, Shaqua, Denise, holler at me.</i>

524
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,222
Rafeca, I see you looking.

525
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,331
Ain't nobody
thinking about you, Worm.

526
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,433
- Oh, okay.
- Gentlemen,

527
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,569
let's review the Hercules game,
shall we?

528
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,601
Yo, yell out my numbers, sir.

529
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,037
Mr. Worm, you were five and four.

530
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,437
No, sir. I had 12 points
and eight assists, sir.

531
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:05,105
No, sir, Mr. Worm. You had five
turnovers and four missed free throws.

532
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:09,283
Now, we're talking
about fundamentals here.

533
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:14,049
Until we learn them, I'm adding
a practice every morning at 6 a.m.

534
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:18,388
- Six a.m.?
- We shot 56 percent at...

535
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,722
Mr. Cruz.

536
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,565
Are you lost, sir?

537
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:25,229
What I gotta do to play?

538
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:30,601
Mr. Cruz, you do not want to know
the answer to that question.

539
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,004
Now, as I was saying,

540
00:33:33,211 --> 00:33:38,046
as a team,
we shot 56 percent from the line.

541
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,047
From now on,
before you leave my gym,

542
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:46,519
you must pay an exit price of 50
made free throws before you can go.

543
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,555
- What?
- That's everybody.

544
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,887
- Come on.
- That's a lot of free throws.

545
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,733
Okay, Mr. Cruz.

546
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,234
Before you can play on this team...

547
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,400
...you owe me...

548
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,175
...2,500 push-ups...

549
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,004
...and 1,000 suicides.

550
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,907
- Damn.
- Damn.

551
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,781
And they must be
completed by Friday.

552
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:18,785
- He ain't finishing that by Friday.
- He ain't making that.

553
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:22,918
Today's flavor: Offense.

554
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,095
- Now we talking.
- Now, I have a sister.

555
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,457
Her name is Linda.

556
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,130
Linda is smart, she's political.

557
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,530
Well, actually, she's radical.

558
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,468
Linda's got a big Afro.

559
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:40,542
Linda is our pick-and-roll offense.

560
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:43,072
Before we get into that,
let's warm up.

561
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,341
Give me a lay-up line.

562
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,450
- Let's go.
- All right.

563
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,313
Let's do it.

564
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,250
- Damn, how many sisters he got?
- Who knows.

565
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:54,288
- Come on, get two more over here.
- Break it out.

566
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,826
- Let's go, guys.
- Energy, guys, energy.

567
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,519
We got this, let's go.

568
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:01,061
- I'm open.
- I got him, I got him.

569
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,823
Right here, right here.
I'm open. I'm open.

570
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,331
I'm sorry.

571
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:05,559
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

572
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,862
- Come on.
- It's not my fault.

573
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:08,265
- He was early.
- Hey.

574
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:11,137
Yes, it's important to move
without the ball,

575
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:14,175
but you gotta be patient
on the weak-side screen.

576
00:35:14,378 --> 00:35:18,405
Set up your man
and come off his shoulder hard. Okay?

577
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,743
Okay. Switch it up.

578
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,386
We got it, come on.
Let's go. Let's get it.

579
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:26,523
- And call out them picks.
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

580
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:31,862
What is your deepest fear,
Mr. Cruz?

581
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:34,622
That you're inadequate?

582
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:36,598
Give up, Mr. Cruz.

583
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:40,937
Go home.

584
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,243
All right, I want seven passes
before you shoot.

585
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,141
- Seven.
- All right.

586
00:35:50,615 --> 00:35:53,448
- I got him. I got him.
- Get that ball in there.

587
00:35:56,754 --> 00:35:59,552
You know your task is impossible
before Friday, right?

588
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,127
Move.

589
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,422
Work it, work it.

590
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,998
Run it back.

591
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:35,390
What time your mom getting home?

592
00:36:35,593 --> 00:36:37,356
She doesn't get off for another hour.

593
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,235
Oh, that's Myles.

594
00:36:48,439 --> 00:36:50,236
What?

595
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:07,514
Say, "Hi, Uncle Kenyon."

596
00:37:07,725 --> 00:37:09,488
Say, "Hi."

597
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:10,956
All right, don't worry about it.

598
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,722
He'll go back to sleep
right after his bottle.

599
00:37:13,931 --> 00:37:15,159
Right, boo-boo?

600
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,732
Yeah, probably in time
for your mom to get home.

601
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,403
Or when your cousin get back
from getting her hair fried and dyed,

602
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:23,301
like she can afford all that shit.
It's her baby anyway.

603
00:37:23,507 --> 00:37:26,704
Well, my mother had to work
a double shift,

604
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,469
but they cut her overtime.

605
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,977
And my cousin,
don't be trying to dis her.

606
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,945
You said we'd be alone.
You call this alone?

607
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:35,914
Well, that's why we need
our own spot.

608
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,854
Did you turn this off?

609
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:44,255
- Yeah, it was boiling.
- Oh, come on.

610
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:46,327
Well, turn it down, not off.

611
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:50,330
This is milk, butter and cheese.
We can't afford to waste this.

612
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:52,863
And hold him up.

613
00:37:58,643 --> 00:38:02,511
Making the baby's bottle for Myles.

614
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:04,613
All right, Myles, here we go.

615
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:07,283
Gotta cool off a minute.

616
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,982
Ever think about what you were
gonna do before you were pregnant?

617
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,390
What you mean,
going to junior college?

618
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:19,756
Yeah.

619
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,489
I mean, yeah, I thought about it.

620
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,701
I could go later, I guess.

621
00:38:25,903 --> 00:38:28,565
You have to get some work
after you have the baby.

622
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,735
Me too.

623
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:33,736
- So I'll work.
- How you gonna go to school?

624
00:38:33,944 --> 00:38:35,605
Why you asking me
all these questions?

625
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:38,407
And you gotta put your hands
under his arm.

626
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,449
You gotta sit him on your chest.
Hold him.

627
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,054
- I am holding him.
- You ain't doing it right.

628
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,746
You gotta soothe him, Kenyon.

629
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:48,515
Look...

630
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,226
I don't know how to do this.

631
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,128
You'll get it.

632
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,800
Right?

633
00:39:00,871 --> 00:39:04,773
Look, I gotta help my mom
with some stuff.

634
00:39:05,543 --> 00:39:08,341
- See you later, all right?
- All right.

635
00:39:10,915 --> 00:39:12,439
Call me later, okay?

636
00:39:12,817 --> 00:39:14,546
Later.

637
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,880
All right, keep it riding on somebody.

638
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,116
- Don't get lost in there.
- Move it. Move it.

639
00:39:23,928 --> 00:39:25,156
Stay with your man.

640
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:28,030
- Box out, box out!
- Position.

641
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:31,765
Guys...

642
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:33,536
Up. Up.

643
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:34,705
Hey, hey, hey.

644
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,396
You don't get to your man, stand,
watch the ball.

645
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,133
When the ball goes up,
get in good defensive position,

646
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,279
get your body on your man
and explode to the ball.

647
00:39:43,481 --> 00:39:45,847
All right? Let's go.

648
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,347
Run it. You got it.

649
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,951
- Go on, do it.
- Forward pass. Forward pass.

650
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:51,917
- Work it.
- There you go.

651
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:55,320
Mrs. Fenton, the police are telling
a very different story.

652
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,926
I wish you would.
Yes, ma'am, I'm here all week.

653
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,230
Mr. Carter, how are the boys?

654
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:02,831
Oh, they're great, ma'am. We're 1-0.

655
00:40:03,033 --> 00:40:04,432
Very good.

656
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:05,897
How may I help you?

657
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,934
Well, I had my boys sign contracts

658
00:40:10,141 --> 00:40:12,803
requiring them to meet
certain academic standards.

659
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,643
Yes, I believe one of the faculty
members mentioned that.

660
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:17,711
Very interesting scare tactic.

661
00:40:19,383 --> 00:40:21,783
Well, in order for that
to be successful,

662
00:40:21,986 --> 00:40:24,648
I need their teachers to fill out
weekly progress reports

663
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,915
so I'll know how the boys
are doing in their classrooms.

664
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:30,826
- Okay.
- Well, I haven't received anything

665
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:32,222
from their teachers.

666
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:39,133
I don't see how this ties in to your job
as the basketball coach, Mr. Carter.

667
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:43,204
Well, I took this job with the
understanding I could do it my way.

668
00:40:43,574 --> 00:40:44,802
And you can.

669
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:46,772
Our next faculty meeting
is in two weeks.

670
00:40:46,977 --> 00:40:48,410
I'll remember to bring it up.

671
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,241
Why, that would be great.
Thank you, ma'am.

672
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:55,348
Thank you, sir.

673
00:40:57,855 --> 00:40:59,914
Bring it in, guys.

674
00:41:00,691 --> 00:41:02,124
Let's go, hustle up.

675
00:41:02,326 --> 00:41:04,123
Yo, bring it in, y'all.

676
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,294
All right, that's it for today.

677
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,262
We have a game tomorrow,
so get some rest tonight.

678
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:14,905
And remember,
ties and jackets tomorrow.

679
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,467
Clyde.

680
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,840
Mr. Cruz.

681
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:31,849
I'm impressed with
what you've done.

682
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:34,589
But you came up short.

683
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:37,590
You owe me 80 suicides
and 500 push-ups.

684
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,660
Please leave my gym.

685
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,159
Thanks, Clyde.

686
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,903
Gentlemen, see you tomorrow.

687
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:52,370
I'll do push-ups for him.

688
00:41:58,249 --> 00:41:59,739
You said we're a team.

689
00:42:00,918 --> 00:42:03,614
One person struggles,
we all struggle.

690
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:06,849
One player triumphs,
we all triumph, right?

691
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:24,998
I'll do some.

692
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,770
I'll run suicides too.

693
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,148
I'll do some too.

694
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:15,287
Clyde, keep count.

695
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,462
Call me when they're done.

696
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:26,061
<i>Defense! Defense!</i>

697
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,329
Push it. Push it. Move, move!

698
00:43:28,539 --> 00:43:29,801
Let's go.

699
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:31,666
Ball, ball, ball.

700
00:43:33,143 --> 00:43:35,008
Ball, ball, ball.

701
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,170
- Yeah!
- Go.

702
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:42,146
Move your feet, move your feet.

703
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,310
Go, defense. Go.

704
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:46,747
Good job. Good job.

705
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,151
- Worm.
- White ball.

706
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:52,523
Palms up, move your feet, right?
Come out. Come out. Come out.

707
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:54,220
- Mr. Cruz!
- Good game, boy.

708
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,995
Hey, hey.

709
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,231
What is your deepest fear,
young man?

710
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,601
Go on.

711
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:09,277
Why he keep saying that, "What's
your deepest fear?" What that mean?

712
00:44:10,481 --> 00:44:12,449
Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

713
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,517
Move. Move. Move.

714
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,550
No, one more pass.

715
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:27,060
Hands up.

716
00:45:14,011 --> 00:45:15,205
Three points, Cruz!

717
00:45:17,448 --> 00:45:20,212
What the hell are you doing, Cruz?
You allergic to lay-ups?

718
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:22,681
You do that again and you're going
to be glued to the bench.

719
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,520
- Swing it.
- Right here.

720
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,230
Come on, last kick.

721
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,923
Kick it in. Kick it in. Let's go.

722
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,874
You can't guard me, can you?
What you gonna do?

723
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,309
- Can't do nothing about it, can you?
- Delilah. Delilah.

724
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:53,881
Come on, come on, come on.

725
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:56,575
- Shot.
- Yeah, Jason.

726
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,382
Kenyon, pose for me.

727
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,086
- Smile.
- Kenyon! Maddux! Get back!

728
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,456
Just play the damn game.

729
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:10,258
Linda, Linda, Linda!

730
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:14,837
There he is. Yeah.

731
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:17,939
That's me, baby.
That's me. I did that.

732
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,542
I drew that up. Yeah.

733
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:23,074
Run it again.

734
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:27,379
All right, 1-4, 1-4.
Linda, Linda, Linda!

735
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:35,083
All day, baby. All day!
Can't stop that.

736
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,192
Can't stop that!

737
00:46:38,328 --> 00:46:42,287
- Hey, coach, your shoe's untied, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Worm.

738
00:46:45,435 --> 00:46:47,665
Look at that bow. Look at that.

739
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:50,601
I tied that. I tied that shit.

740
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:52,776
Can I get something on the bow?
Let me get some.

741
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:55,211
Are you crazy?

742
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:57,770
What is wrong with you?

743
00:46:58,015 --> 00:47:00,313
What's wrong with all of you?

744
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:04,050
Since when is winning not enough?

745
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:07,621
Playing hard not enough?

746
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:11,494
No, you have to humiliate
your opponent.

747
00:47:11,695 --> 00:47:14,493
Taunt him after every score.

748
00:47:14,965 --> 00:47:17,433
You won four games last season.

749
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,828
Four.

750
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:22,267
What gives you the right
to taint the game that I love

751
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:25,168
with trash talk and taunting?

752
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:28,674
What gives you the right to wear
Richmond on your chests

753
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:29,971
and act like punks?

754
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:32,614
- Coach, they were jawing too.
- So?

755
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:34,443
You can't show some class?

756
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,085
Act like a champion?

757
00:47:40,057 --> 00:47:42,753
You owe me 500 push-ups apiece.

758
00:47:43,293 --> 00:47:45,659
On the line. Now.

759
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,855
- Damn.
- Oh, man, come on.

760
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:08,017
Listen, shorty, I'm just gonna be real
with you, okay?

761
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,379
You're my girl.

762
00:48:10,587 --> 00:48:13,988
I get out on that court
and everything is just getting crazy,

763
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,921
all I gotta do is just think about you.

764
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:18,321
Mr. Lyle.

765
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:21,393
Why aren't you in...

766
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:25,230
...geometry?
- I'm going there right now, sir.

767
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:27,934
- Sir, this is Betty.
- Bella.

768
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:30,003
Bella. Bella. This is Bella, sir.

769
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,799
Go to class.

770
00:48:36,914 --> 00:48:40,350
Don't forget that these projects
are due at the end of this week.

771
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,781
- So if any of you need extra time...
- Excuse me, sir. Are you Mr. Gesek?

772
00:48:43,987 --> 00:48:46,080
- Yes.
- I...

773
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:49,389
...don't see Junior Battle
in this class.

774
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:52,494
Junior Battle is like a solar eclipse.

775
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:56,689
We rarely see him, but when we do,
it's always special.

776
00:48:58,802 --> 00:49:00,235
Thank you.

777
00:49:01,972 --> 00:49:04,964
"Surprise arrival to the poll
is Richmond High at 19th."

778
00:49:05,175 --> 00:49:07,871
- Top 20, baby.
- We're 19th, dog.

779
00:49:08,078 --> 00:49:10,342
"The Oilers have posted
a perfect 9-0 mark,

780
00:49:10,547 --> 00:49:12,538
winning on the road against
perennial powerhouses

781
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:14,148
Xavier and Baxter Union."

782
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,846
Junior, you should read
the rest of this.

783
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:21,854
They blowing you up
in this paper.

784
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,421
- Come on, man, read it.
- Man, you know he can't read.

785
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:28,325
- Man, shut up.
- Shut up, Maddux.

786
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:34,963
"Richmond center has been big
as the Oilers are 'boyed."'

787
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:39,108
Buoyed. The word is "buoyed."

788
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:44,773
"Buoyed by Junior Battle's
19.8- Rebound-a-night numbers."

789
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:48,646
See, that's my big nigga
right there, son. Hey.

790
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:51,320
If you was any bigger,
you'd be my bigger nigga.

791
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:54,980
Sit down. Sit down!

792
00:50:03,767 --> 00:50:10,331
"Nigger" is a derogatory term
used to insult our ancestors.

793
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:14,402
See, if a white man used it,
you'd be ready to fight.

794
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:17,444
Your using it teaches him to use it.

795
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,639
You're saying it's cool.
Well, it's not cool.

796
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,115
And when you're around me,
I don't wanna hear that shit.

797
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,880
- We clear?
- Yes, sir.

798
00:50:26,089 --> 00:50:27,522
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

799
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:29,021
Yes, sir.

800
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,454
Mr. Worm,

801
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:35,130
what is it you want
out of this basketball season?

802
00:50:35,665 --> 00:50:38,964
To win that state championship, sir.

803
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:44,199
Well, who won the state basketball
championship last season, Lyle?

804
00:50:44,674 --> 00:50:46,471
Hell if I know, sir.

805
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:48,842
Does anybody know?

806
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,438
Okay.

807
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,511
What's your father do for a living,
Mr. Lyle?

808
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,892
My father's in jail, sir.

809
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,557
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

810
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:11,290
But that doesn't have to be your life.

811
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:14,069
My point's this:

812
00:51:14,271 --> 00:51:16,603
I have four seniors on this team,

813
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:19,776
Junior, Lyle, Kenyon and Worm.

814
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:23,742
All of whom I think can play
basketball at the college level.

815
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:25,311
College.

816
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:29,284
That's a viable option for all of you.

817
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:33,622
But you have to perform in the
classroom to have that chance.

818
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,354
You have to have a vision.

819
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:41,488
Tell me, how do you
see yourselves?

820
00:51:43,667 --> 00:51:46,192
ESPN, baby.

821
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:48,969
That reminds me, Mr. Battle.

822
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:53,666
Mr. Gesek tells me he doesn't
see you in his classroom very often.

823
00:51:54,144 --> 00:51:56,669
Yeah, we cool, though, me and him.

824
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,871
Mr. Gesek is a big basketball fan.

825
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,585
Well, as of now, you're suspended.

826
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,583
Oh, you can practice,
but you can't play

827
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:08,383
until Mr. Gesek tells me
you're caught up in his class.

828
00:52:08,592 --> 00:52:11,026
And that's a shout out
to the rest of you.

829
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,627
You signed a contract.

830
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,524
You made a commitment.

831
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:17,928
Now, I have your schedules and I'll be
getting reports from your teachers.

832
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:22,336
If you don't perform in the
classroom, you will not play.

833
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,937
What's up with that?

834
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,139
Sit down, Mr. Battle.

835
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:32,546
All right, that's 500 push-ups.

836
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:38,119
Man, this is bullshit!
We won those games, not you.

837
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,381
That's 1,000 push-ups
for Mr. Battle, Clyde.

838
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,752
You wanna try for 2,000?

839
00:53:00,277 --> 00:53:06,147
Young man, think about the choice
you're making if you walk out that door.

840
00:53:14,758 --> 00:53:16,749
To the baseline.

841
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:24,027
All right. How about LaQuisha,
if it's a girl.

842
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:28,728
LaQuisha? Okay, yeah, the ghetto
called and they want they name back.

843
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:31,032
Girl, LaQuisha? Be for real.

844
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,539
You might as well call the baby
Food Stamp.

845
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:35,335
You're stupid.

846
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:40,073
All right, I was thinking
I could call her Harmony.

847
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,218
- I like Harmony.
- Harmony, oh, that's good. I like that.

848
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:46,685
- What did Kenyon say?
- Please, he want a boy.

849
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,256
- Figures.
- Speaking of Michael Jordan...

850
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:50,858
Yo, what's wrong with a girl?

851
00:53:51,194 --> 00:53:54,686
Yeah, dog, boys grow into men,
and men ain't worth the trouble.

852
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,264
Don't you have someplace to go?
Something to do?

853
00:53:58,368 --> 00:54:01,132
Guess he wants me all to himself.

854
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:02,362
See you later.

855
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,233
Don't forget,
I need your notes for history.

856
00:54:04,441 --> 00:54:07,638
- All right, I got you.
- Yeah. See you later.

857
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,772
I bought us tickets to the dance.

858
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:15,016
Why you telling these
loudmouth girls about the baby?

859
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,152
Now everybody's gonna know.

860
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:18,912
People are gonna know, Kenyon.

861
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:22,289
- It's not people's business, Kyra.
- Why you jumping down my throat?

862
00:54:22,492 --> 00:54:23,925
What's wrong with you?

863
00:54:24,961 --> 00:54:29,261
Look, me and coach been talking,
and he thinks I can play college ball.

864
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:30,490
All right, so?

865
00:54:31,368 --> 00:54:33,893
So how am I gonna do that
and raise a baby?

866
00:54:36,673 --> 00:54:40,131
I don't know. I mean,
I'm not saying it won't be hard.

867
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:42,742
Hard? It's already hard.

868
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:44,504
The kid ain't even here yet
and I'm worried

869
00:54:44,714 --> 00:54:47,842
about how I'm gonna feed it,
how I'm gonna pay for this and that.

870
00:54:48,318 --> 00:54:49,512
Everything.

871
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:51,877
- I'm not ready.
- So, what are you saying?

872
00:54:52,088 --> 00:54:55,182
You want out?
Is that what you're saying?

873
00:54:55,392 --> 00:54:56,859
Go ahead and say it.

874
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,893
Look, if I wanted to be out,
I would've been out by now, Kyra.

875
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,791
That's not it at all. I love you.

876
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:03,392
I wanna be with you.

877
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,625
Yeah, as long as it's convenient.

878
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:07,200
I'm thinking about
what's best for us.

879
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:09,634
You're not trying to think about
what's best for both of us,

880
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,431
you're thinking about
what's best for you.

881
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:15,277
You don't want me to have this baby.
You wanna leave Richmond.

882
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:18,311
You wanna go play college ball.
So guess what?

883
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:22,417
We ain't got to be ready enough
for nothing, all right?

884
00:55:22,952 --> 00:55:25,546
I'm ready enough to do what
I gotta do all by my damn self.

885
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:28,724
So you can take these
and go to the dance yourself.

886
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:32,988
Progress reports?
You're the basketball coach.

887
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,687
Look, ma'am, we talked about this.
I don't see what the problem is.

888
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,423
Do you know what the API is,
Mr. Carter?

889
00:55:37,634 --> 00:55:38,965
No, I don't.

890
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,830
The Academic Performance Index.

891
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:44,063
They judge schools on a scale
of one to ten, ten being the best.

892
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:46,708
Do you have any idea
where Richmond falls on that scale?

893
00:55:46,910 --> 00:55:48,172
No, ma'am, I have no idea.

894
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,108
We're a one, Mr. Carter, and have
been for the last seven years.

895
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,282
The state rewards schools
for their performance.

896
00:55:53,483 --> 00:55:55,849
So every year I have less money
to pay faculty and staff.

897
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:58,987
- Look, ma'am...
- Can I ask what it is you want?

898
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:01,180
- I want my boys to go to college.
- College?

899
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,053
Mr. Carter, Richmond graduates
50 percent of its students,

900
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:05,557
the higher percentage being girls.

901
00:56:05,762 --> 00:56:08,629
Now, in my very educated opinion,
you have 15 players on your team,

902
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:10,561
you'll be lucky to graduate
five of them.

903
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:12,564
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but I don't agree with you.

904
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:15,567
Look, these boys signed contracts.
Maybe if you'd read one of them...

905
00:56:15,772 --> 00:56:18,240
Your job is to win basketball games,
Mr. Carter.

906
00:56:18,441 --> 00:56:23,071
- I suggest you start doing your job.
- And your job is to educate these kids.

907
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:26,874
I suggest you start doing yours.

908
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,590
Well...

909
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,156
...we had another good week.

910
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,700
Yeah, business is very good, Kenny.

911
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:50,770
But I'm on my own.
You're never here.

912
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:53,670
- It gets crazy.
- Look, I appreciate everything you do.

913
00:56:53,877 --> 00:56:55,970
And I promise you... We're closed.

914
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,739
- As soon as the season is over,
I will be here for you.

915
00:56:58,948 --> 00:57:00,381
Mr. Carter?

916
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,174
- I'm...
- Junior Battle's mother.

917
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:03,943
Yes, ma'am, I remember you.

918
00:57:04,154 --> 00:57:06,816
Willa. Willa Battle.

919
00:57:08,191 --> 00:57:09,385
How may I help you, ma'am?

920
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:10,991
Mr. Carter, I got a phone call today

921
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:13,890
from a coach at a junior college
in Sacramento.

922
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,122
Now, they wanna see
Junior play this Friday.

923
00:57:16,332 --> 00:57:18,664
Well, that's great, ma'am,
but Junior broke some rules...

924
00:57:18,868 --> 00:57:20,392
And I agree with them.

925
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,163
I'm not here to argue
with your rules.

926
00:57:23,373 --> 00:57:24,965
I'm not.

927
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,245
Almost two years ago now,

928
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:34,743
Junior's older brother, Anton, was...

929
00:57:35,418 --> 00:57:40,754
...killed, and it's been confusing
and hard for me and for Junior.

930
00:57:41,858 --> 00:57:44,122
After you lose a son...

931
00:57:45,261 --> 00:57:50,255
...every time the phone rings,
your heart stops.

932
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:54,760
Now, I'm not asking
for special attention.

933
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:58,566
I agree he needs to get straight
with his classes.

934
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:02,805
But the idea of junior college
had never even occurred to my son.

935
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:06,880
Now, I could move to the Hercules
school district, and he could play there.

936
00:58:07,083 --> 00:58:11,816
- But moving is not gonna solve...
- But I want him to play for you.

937
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:14,821
Look, I'm not gonna stand here

938
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:18,551
and say I know how it feels
to lose a son, because I don't.

939
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:23,627
And I do appreciate you
putting your trust in me.

940
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:26,632
But I need to hear that from Junior.

941
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,766
He in the car.

942
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:35,275
Junior!

943
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,646
Go on.

944
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,327
I'm sorry for what I said and did
at practice,

945
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:58,626
and I promise to get caught up
with my classes, sir.

946
00:59:03,806 --> 00:59:06,138
Look me in the eye, sir.

947
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:13,778
Everything inside me tells me
if I take you back,

948
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:16,543
I'd be making a mistake
and you'll make a fool of me.

949
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,653
No, sir.

950
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,156
You owe me 1,000 push-ups

951
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:26,021
and 1,000 suicides
before you can play.

952
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,864
I'll see you at practice tomorrow.

953
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,931
Thank you, sir.

954
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,774
And you gonna do
every last one of them.

955
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,038
Quitting basketball like you pay rent.

956
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,648
I don't know who you think you are.

957
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:51,217
The next time you make a decision,
you better ask me first.

958
00:59:51,521 --> 00:59:53,887
Yo, Junior,
you did your thing tonight, man.

959
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,718
- Good looking out, yo.
- Yeah, good shot, Junior.

960
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,520
- Yeah, no doubt.
- Gentlemen, listen up.

961
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:04,194
I just received a call from the director
of the Bayhill Holiday Tournament.

962
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,732
You have been invited.

963
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,427
- Yeah!
- Yeah, baby!

964
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,306
Now, I have more good news.

965
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,604
I spoke to Principal Garrison today.

966
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,682
She informs me that your teachers will
have your academic-progress reports

967
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:23,784
prepared by the end
of holiday break.

968
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:25,477
Sir, our grades are tight, yo.

969
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:27,551
Yo, not only are our grades
all right, coach,

970
01:00:27,757 --> 01:00:30,419
- but we undefeated, homeboy.
- Yeah!

971
01:00:31,828 --> 01:00:34,854
<i>We undefeated
We undefeated</i>

972
01:00:35,064 --> 01:00:39,296
<i>We undefeated
We undefeated</i>

973
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:43,302
<i>We undefeated
We undefeated</i>

974
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:48,600
Big ups to everybody who came out to
the Richmond High winter dance, y'all!

975
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,369
Get down!

976
01:01:12,935 --> 01:01:15,768
So give it up for the new
kings of Richmond, y'all!

977
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,837
Yeah! Give it up, baby!

978
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:19,975
Yo, we 12-0, y'all,
and I just wanna say

979
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,838
I wanna see all the beautiful people
up at that tournament.

980
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,570
You know!

981
01:01:24,781 --> 01:01:27,545
Y'all gonna wanna see the look on
the faces of them rich fancy-schoolers

982
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,479
when the Richmond Oilers
roll into town.

983
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,916
Holla!

984
01:02:52,301 --> 01:02:54,633
Kyra, what are you thinking?
You can't drink!

985
01:02:54,837 --> 01:02:56,634
- You're pregnant, girl.
- Stop.

986
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:58,067
It's soda, all right?

987
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,071
So why don't you just go
back downstairs

988
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,141
and find one of your little girlies
to freak with.

989
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:04,575
It ain't even like that.
Some girl just danced up on me.

990
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:06,442
- That ain't shit.
- Whatever.

991
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,549
You shouldn't be here.
If you're serious about this,

992
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,548
you need to check this bullshit.
Because if not...

993
01:03:10,753 --> 01:03:13,984
If not, what, Kenyon? You wanna hold
my hand through an abortion?

994
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:16,158
- Is that what you want?
- I don't know what I want.

995
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:17,883
You so damn sure you wanna
have this baby,

996
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,584
why don't you tell me how
it's gonna be.

997
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,491
Everything's great, right?

998
01:03:21,697 --> 01:03:24,325
Your cousin is 19 with two kids
already, Kyra.

999
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:25,899
It's great?

1000
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:27,967
It was great when we
was getting down.

1001
01:03:28,171 --> 01:03:29,866
You ain't having no second
thoughts about that.

1002
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:32,370
You loved me
when it came to that.

1003
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,504
Look, Kyra, I can't tell you
what to do,

1004
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:39,710
but I look around and I see exactly
how I don't wanna live.

1005
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:41,213
Paycheck to paycheck?

1006
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,907
Dead-end job?

1007
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,451
You make it seem like everything's
gonna be all good,

1008
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,919
like everything's so wonderful.

1009
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:51,189
You don't care about me.

1010
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:55,559
You just wanna go to college,
play ball and forget about me.

1011
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:58,298
- Kyra, that's not even how it is.
- I don't care what you say.

1012
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,402
- I'm having this baby.
- And then what?

1013
01:04:01,604 --> 01:04:03,071
You got everything figured out, right?

1014
01:04:03,873 --> 01:04:06,171
So tell me what comes next.

1015
01:04:32,134 --> 01:04:35,535
<i>The third and final day of
the 22nd Bayhill Tournament</i>

1016
01:04:35,738 --> 01:04:37,797
<i>finds the host team, Bayhill,</i>

1017
01:04:38,007 --> 01:04:42,171
<i>trying to win the championship against
the surprising Richmond Oilers.</i>

1018
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,777
<i>Defense! Defense!</i>

1019
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:45,379
Get your hands up!

1020
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:52,582
Get that ball!

1021
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:06,401
<i>Richmond uses their last timeout with
1:20 remaining in the fourth quarter</i>

1022
01:05:06,602 --> 01:05:08,934
<i>- and Bayhill up by six.
- Time out!</i>

1023
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,366
Come on, man.
We still in the game. Come on.

1024
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,655
Don't panic.

1025
01:05:27,390 --> 01:05:29,358
We're six down with 1:20 left, right?

1026
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:31,389
We've been in these guys' ass
the whole game.

1027
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:32,788
We can do this.

1028
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,395
- This is our time, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

1029
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,660
All right, set up the 1-4.
Run Candy.

1030
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:40,460
Damien's gonna hit the three.

1031
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:43,264
Kenyon, Lyle,
set a hard screen down here.

1032
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,099
When he hits the three,
go right into Diane.

1033
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:47,571
Pressure the inbound pass.

1034
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,404
Suffocate that pass.

1035
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,239
I want the ball back!

1036
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,278
- Come on, baby, lock up.
- Hands in.

1037
01:05:53,482 --> 01:05:55,507
- Let's go.
- "Our time" on three!

1038
01:05:55,718 --> 01:05:57,777
- One, two, three!
- Our time!

1039
01:05:57,987 --> 01:05:59,352
Come on, let's go.

1040
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:09,027
One, two, three, Cougars!

1041
01:06:09,231 --> 01:06:10,858
Let's go, guys!

1042
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,699
1-4! 1-4! Candy!

1043
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:23,504
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Ball, ball, ball, ball!

1044
01:06:24,246 --> 01:06:25,804
Watch him!

1045
01:06:27,283 --> 01:06:31,219
- Watch your back! Come in!
- Watch the screen!

1046
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,420
Make the shot, Damien!

1047
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:39,357
Diane! Diane!

1048
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:40,859
<i>Defense!</i>

1049
01:06:44,100 --> 01:06:46,159
Go, go, go. Ball, ball, ball.

1050
01:06:47,069 --> 01:06:49,128
Right there, right there. I got him.

1051
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,074
- Off him, man. Off him.
- Richmond's ball!

1052
01:06:53,275 --> 01:06:55,004
Richmond's ball!

1053
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,468
Yeah!

1054
01:07:00,483 --> 01:07:03,316
Kenyon! Kenyon!
Hattie Jean! Hattie Jean!

1055
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,749
Hattie Jean, Hattie Jean,
Hattie Jean!

1056
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:08,048
- D up!
- Check! Check!

1057
01:07:12,061 --> 01:07:13,358
- Get there!
- Right there!

1058
01:07:19,735 --> 01:07:20,997
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1059
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:24,365
Move your feet!
Move your feet!

1060
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:36,347
A foul, ref!

1061
01:07:40,289 --> 01:07:42,780
Right wing, Kenyon, wing!

1062
01:07:49,265 --> 01:07:51,893
<i>Richmond takes the lead
for the first time in the game,</i>

1063
01:07:52,101 --> 01:07:54,865
<i>78 to 76.</i>

1064
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:03,772
Slow the ball down!
Slow the ball down!

1065
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:08,173
<i>Let's go, Cougars, let's go!</i>

1066
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:13,447
<i>Defense! Defense!</i>

1067
01:08:19,328 --> 01:08:23,628
- That's a charge! Driving!
- Basket's good!

1068
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:28,769
<i>The basket counts,
and the Cougars have tied the game.</i>

1069
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:32,606
That was a bad call, ref!

1070
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:39,076
- Basket counts! One shot!
- That's a charge!

1071
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:42,512
- Foul's on red five. On the block.
- Don't tie me like that!

1072
01:08:43,352 --> 01:08:45,479
Coach! Please get back in the box.

1073
01:08:45,688 --> 01:08:47,747
Please get in the box?
Please get your head in the game!

1074
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,185
Give me a break!

1075
01:08:49,391 --> 01:08:51,621
Cruz. In for Lyle.

1076
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,995
- Kenyon! Damien!
- Sub, for five.

1077
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:57,055
Let's go.

1078
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,665
Listen, we got nine seconds left.
Get the ball, push it hard.

1079
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:03,395
The ball's coming to you, Kenyon.
Run Linda. Run Linda.

1080
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,471
You be open, all right?
Let's go. You can do this.

1081
01:09:05,674 --> 01:09:07,835
Do it. Let's go.
Come on, sirs. Hurry.

1082
01:09:08,043 --> 01:09:10,068
Let's go, guys! Let's go!

1083
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:13,943
Let's go! Let's go!

1084
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:16,713
One shot.
