00:00:06,716 --> 00:00:09,251

00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:18,260

(flushes toilet)

8
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,294
Hi, Mom.

9
00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:55,765
No, everything's fine.

10
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,267
(clears throat)

11
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:00,135
Yeah.

12
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:02,437
I was just thinking
about that cabin

13
00:01:02,471 --> 00:01:06,174
that Uncle Andy used
to take us to when I was a kid.

14
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:11,279
Do they still own that?

15
00:01:11,313 --> 00:01:12,347
What are you doing this week?

16
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,486
(tired grunt)

17
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:20,222
I don't know, nothing.

18
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:21,958
Great.

19
00:01:21,991 --> 00:01:23,826
We're gonna leave.

20
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:25,595
Where are we goin'?

21
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:29,666
It's this beautiful old cottage
in the middle of the woods.

22
00:01:29,699 --> 00:01:30,833
I used to go there
for holidays

23
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:33,770
and sometimes
in the summer.

24
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:34,771
Does your uncle
still live there?

25
00:01:34,804 --> 00:01:36,371
No, he never lived there.

26
00:01:36,405 --> 00:01:38,540
He just owns it.

27
00:01:38,573 --> 00:01:40,643
So it's like
a real summer home.

28
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,379
Yeah.

29
00:01:44,413 --> 00:01:46,214
It's kind of weird
to think about now, right?

30
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:48,584
Hm, must be nice.

- I want to see somethin'.

(crickets chirring)

59
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,589
But why would they renovate it?

60
00:03:35,357 --> 00:03:36,826
Look, I can't...

61
00:03:36,859 --> 00:03:38,928
Why would they do that?

62
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,430
That's bullshit.

63
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:51,941
What's goin' on?

64
00:03:51,974 --> 00:03:53,709
They tore down
the old cottage,

65
00:03:53,743 --> 00:03:56,045
and then they built this.

66
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,547
Thought your uncle
didn't even come here anymore.

67
00:03:58,581 --> 00:04:01,684
They're gonna rent it out
as a vacation home.

68
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,753
Oh...

69
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,754
I'm sorry, that sucks.

70
00:04:04,787 --> 00:04:07,657
Yeah! It does suck.

71
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:16,799
You still wanna stay?

72
00:04:27,109 --> 00:04:28,443
Yeah.

73
00:04:30,012 --> 00:04:31,848
We'll stay.

00:04:36,451 --> 00:04:38,721

Looks like
someone's burning something.

81
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,615
How far does
your uncle's land extend?

82
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:48,851
I don't know.

83
00:06:48,884 --> 00:06:51,519
Pretty far,
from what I can remember.

84
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:09,038
Nature is so... big.

85
00:07:11,573 --> 00:07:13,009
For real.

86
00:07:17,847 --> 00:07:19,582
I'm tired.

Hey.

98
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:14,770
Do you wanna fuck?

99
00:08:21,377 --> 00:08:23,712
Do you mind
if we didn't tonight?

100
00:08:23,746 --> 00:08:25,681
I'm really tired.

101
00:08:28,084 --> 00:08:29,218
Okay.

Do you want me
to make you a PB and J?

Who... what... what is this?

110
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,770
Hello.

111

Who are you?

112
00:10:28,971 --> 00:10:31,307
I'm a person.

113
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,875
You don't look like a person.

00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:43,986
You know her?

00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,789
- Yes.
- How?

121
00:10:46,822 --> 00:10:49,191
It's been a long time.

122
00:10:49,225 --> 00:10:50,993

Hey. Are you okay?

126
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,899
I can come back later.

127
00:10:56,932 --> 00:10:58,834
Hey, you want to take
that fuckin' mask off?

128
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,003
This is my face.

129
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,339
Hey, mask man,
you gotta go.

130
00:11:03,372 --> 00:11:06,909
Okay, I'll... I'll leave.

131
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:08,310
I'm sorry.

133
00:11:13,148 --> 00:11:16,285
Hey, let's get you to
lie down, all right? Come on.

00:11:28,998 --> 00:11:31,333
(soft, escalating
whooshing sound)

135
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,799
Maybe he really left.

Maybe.

137
00:12:07,303 --> 00:12:09,872
He said
he was coming back though.

138
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,474
Yeah.

139
00:12:16,178 --> 00:12:19,081
It knew your name.

140
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,082
Did you tell that thing
your name?

141
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:23,919
No, he acted like he knew me.

142
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,555
That freaked me out
even more than how he looked.

143
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:32,595
You sure
you didn't ever, like,

144
00:12:32,629 --> 00:12:37,266
hang out with cults
or something, like,

145
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,334
when you were a kid?

146
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:41,937
No. I don't think so.

147
00:12:43,439 --> 00:12:46,041
Might be some
repressed memories.

148
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:48,877
Shut up.

149
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,655
Oh, God.

150
00:12:58,688 --> 00:13:00,522
Here we go.

151
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:11,200
Hello.

152
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:14,136
What do you want, man?

153
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,071
I want to talk to Brynn.

154
00:13:16,105 --> 00:13:17,172
Yeah, well, she doesn't
want to talk to you.

155
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:21,176
No, it's okay.
It's fine.

156
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,178
Are you all right?

157
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,949
Yeah.

158
00:13:26,982 --> 00:13:29,318
You seemed disturbed.

159
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,653
I was.

160
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:33,555
You scared me.

161
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,190
Why?

162
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:39,561
You're... scary.

163
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:42,131
You don't remember me?

164
00:13:42,164 --> 00:13:43,298
No.

165
00:13:45,735 --> 00:13:48,137
It's been a long time,

166
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:50,439
but I thought
you were here to see me.

167
00:13:50,472 --> 00:13:52,241
I'm sorry, I don't mean
to hurt your feelings.

168
00:13:52,274 --> 00:13:55,944
I just don't know
what you're talking about.

169
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,913
I understand.

170
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:03,419
Hey, man, um,
what are you supposed to be?

171
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,088
What am I?

172
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:09,659
Yeah, with the mask
and the woods and everything.

173
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,564
What's your species,
your name?

174
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:19,334
There's no need
to name things in nature.

175
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:20,569
To identify
a natural thing

176
00:14:20,603 --> 00:14:24,006
is like addressing
a ripple of water.

177
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:28,977
So you don't have a name.

178
00:14:29,011 --> 00:14:31,013
When you were here before,

179
00:14:31,046 --> 00:14:33,650
you decided
my name was Rue.

180
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:36,218
You can call me that
if you want.

181
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,621
- Rue?
- Yeah.

182
00:14:42,024 --> 00:14:43,325
Okay.

183
00:14:45,461 --> 00:14:46,663
I'm Laika.

184
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:49,364
I'm sorry,
this is my boyfriend Laika.

185
00:14:52,367 --> 00:14:54,470
Are you in love?

186
00:15:00,209 --> 00:15:02,077
- Yeah.
- Sure.

187
00:15:07,082 --> 00:15:09,251
I have to go now.

188
00:15:09,284 --> 00:15:11,119
Okay.

189
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:25,234
(crickets chirring)

190
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:28,036
- I'll pour it.
- No, I'll pour it.

191
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,240
That's... that's enough,
that's enough!

192
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:33,442
Mm.

193
00:15:36,345 --> 00:15:37,412
(video plays on phone)

194
00:15:37,446 --> 00:15:39,448
Hey, guys, if I get a million
likes on this video,

195
00:15:39,481 --> 00:15:42,184
I will eat this bagel,
I swear to God!

196
00:15:42,217 --> 00:15:43,318
Oh, my God.

197
00:15:47,089 --> 00:15:48,090
Hi.

198
00:15:49,191 --> 00:15:50,192
Hey.

199
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:57,299
Damn, whiskey makes
you smell so good.

200
00:15:58,835 --> 00:16:00,168
(agreeable moan)

201
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:10,479
No.

202
00:16:12,815 --> 00:16:15,317
I don't really feel good.

203
00:16:17,219 --> 00:16:18,755
(groans)

204
00:16:18,788 --> 00:16:20,790
I'm sorry.

205
00:16:27,396 --> 00:16:29,666
Uh... are you okay?

206
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:30,833
No.

207
00:16:36,572 --> 00:16:38,841
Oh, do you need anything?

208
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:42,344
No, I don't need anything.

209
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:45,682
I'm fine, obviously.

210
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,784
Whoa, hey.

211
00:16:47,817 --> 00:16:49,184
It's a joke.

212
00:16:49,217 --> 00:16:50,887
(laughs)

213
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,254
Hey.

214
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,843
It was a joke.

215
00:17:17,346 --> 00:17:19,114
(vomiting, coughing)

216
00:17:24,553 --> 00:17:28,423
(fire crackling)

217
00:17:55,517 --> 00:17:57,854
I think Rue left a gift for ya.

218
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:07,262
What's this?

219
00:18:09,364 --> 00:18:11,934
That was nice of him.

220
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:22,912
You want to do anything today?

221
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:25,280
I don't know.

222
00:18:33,488 --> 00:18:37,927
Well, actually,
we could go on a picnic.

223
00:18:40,262 --> 00:18:42,364
We could do that.

224
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:48,236
Yeah, I wanna go on a picnic.

225
00:18:54,711 --> 00:18:56,846
Where do you think he lives?

226
00:18:56,879 --> 00:18:58,815
I don't know.

227
00:18:58,848 --> 00:18:59,982
The woods or something.

228
00:19:00,016 --> 00:19:01,851
(Brynn laughs)

229
00:19:01,884 --> 00:19:06,956
Yeah, but is it, like,
a house or a hut or a treehouse?

230
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:13,730
I think he lives in, like,
a interdimensional hammock.

231
00:19:13,763 --> 00:19:14,764
What?

232
00:19:14,797 --> 00:19:19,001
What the hell is an
interdimensional hammock?

233
00:19:19,035 --> 00:19:22,304
It's like a hammock that exists
between two parallel universes.

234
00:19:22,337 --> 00:19:23,773
Oh, right.

235
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:26,508
Come on.

236
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:29,779
I just hope he don't pop up
out of nowhere anymore.

237
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:37,552
So, do you, like, eat food?

238
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:41,991
Not really.

239
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:44,727
Word.

240
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,532
(hawk cries)

241
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:55,370
What do you do in the woods?

242
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:59,008
I make sure that things grow.

243
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:04,346
Like a... like a groundskeeper?

244
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:06,348
I don't really know
what that is,

245
00:20:06,381 --> 00:20:07,917
but I think so.

246
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,886
You take care of the woods.

247
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,053
Yeah.

248
00:20:14,624 --> 00:20:17,093
So where are you from, man?

249
00:20:17,126 --> 00:20:19,595
I've always been here.

250
00:20:19,629 --> 00:20:21,496
How long is that?

251
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:25,367
I couldn't say.

252
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,302
Nature doesn't keep track
of time.

253
00:20:28,905 --> 00:20:30,940
That's not true.

254
00:20:30,973 --> 00:20:32,608
Trees have rings.

255
00:20:32,642 --> 00:20:34,442
Mammals know
when it's winter or spring.

256
00:20:34,476 --> 00:20:35,611
Laika...

257
00:20:36,746 --> 00:20:38,948
I'm just saying.

258
00:20:38,981 --> 00:20:40,049
It's not like
nature's some void

259
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:42,618
where nothing means anything.

260
00:20:42,652 --> 00:20:44,486
That's not what I meant.

261
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,487
That's what it sounded like.

262
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,056
Say what you mean.

263
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,897
I'm sorry.

264
00:20:54,931 --> 00:20:56,766
I wasn't trying to be a dick.

265
00:20:58,835 --> 00:21:01,037
I didn't think anything of it.

266
00:21:19,589 --> 00:21:21,858
Why are you being
that way to him?

267
00:21:21,891 --> 00:21:23,626
Like what?

268
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,761
You're kind of being an asshole.

269
00:21:25,795 --> 00:21:27,096
Am I?

270
00:21:27,129 --> 00:21:27,997
Yeah, you are.

271
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:31,667
You're being a dick,
starting fights.

272
00:21:31,701 --> 00:21:33,636
He's a weird dude.

273
00:21:33,669 --> 00:21:35,403
He says weird things.

274
00:21:35,437 --> 00:21:37,505
So I'm not weird?

275
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:38,506
You're not weird?

276
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,542
What's so weird about him?

277
00:21:40,575 --> 00:21:41,677
He doesn't believe in time.

278
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:44,814
And he says he's known you
since you were a kid.

279
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,415
And you don't remember
any of it.

280
00:21:47,449 --> 00:21:50,385
That's weird.
That's a weird thing.

281
00:21:52,221 --> 00:21:54,957
Just don't think
you're being very nice.

282
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:57,860
I don't understand why
you're being nice at all.

283
00:21:57,894 --> 00:22:00,462
Because I'm a nice person.

284
00:22:00,495 --> 00:22:01,697
Are you?

285
00:22:01,731 --> 00:22:03,799
What the fuck does that mean?

286
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,501
You can be a bitch.

287
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,970
Like in a good way.

288
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:09,038
That's our whole dynamic.

289
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:10,472
You're a bitch,
I'm an asshole.

290
00:22:10,505 --> 00:22:12,440
That's our thing.

291
00:22:14,844 --> 00:22:17,647
Sorry I'm not being enough
of a bitch for you.

292
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:20,182
- Jesus.
- You know what I mean*.

293
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:24,120
You know what, that... that...
that doesn't make any sense.

294
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:26,188
I'm taking a walk.

295
00:22:48,177 --> 00:22:50,613
Ow, shit!

00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:51,614

I was... I was just callin'
to see how you're doin'.

304
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:18,868
And it just seems like
you kind of disappeared

305
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:20,770
these past few months, so...

306
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:24,073
Yeah, well,
I hope things are going well.

307
00:24:24,106 --> 00:24:29,211

375
00:31:48,585 --> 00:31:50,452
You adored it.

376
00:31:54,657 --> 00:31:55,991
Wow.

377
00:31:57,559 --> 00:31:58,695
Yeah.

378
00:32:00,062 --> 00:32:01,631
Yeah, I...

379
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:04,166
I loved this pond.

380
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:09,171
I liked it because it was
the perfect temperature.

381
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:13,108
You used to say
it was like lying on the...

382
00:32:13,141 --> 00:32:15,410
On the kitchen floor.

383
00:32:18,748 --> 00:32:20,082
Whoa.

384
00:32:26,488 --> 00:32:28,825
This is crazy.

385
00:32:28,858 --> 00:32:30,459
I'm remembering.

386
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:33,495
We used to play here
all the time.

387
00:32:33,529 --> 00:32:36,498
Yeah, we did.

388
00:32:36,532 --> 00:32:38,300
I would always...

389
00:32:40,536 --> 00:32:43,606
I made things.

390
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:46,141
That's very easy here.

391
00:32:53,816 --> 00:32:55,818
Holy shit.

392
00:32:58,287 --> 00:33:00,389
You try.

393
00:33:00,422 --> 00:33:03,191
See if you remember.

394
00:33:03,225 --> 00:33:05,327
I have no idea.

395
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,664
Pick something up.

396
00:33:10,499 --> 00:33:12,635
Anything?

397
00:33:25,748 --> 00:33:35,692
(♪♪♪)

398
00:33:40,195 --> 00:33:43,198
(wings fluttering)

399
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,434
It's like you never left.

400
00:33:45,467 --> 00:33:46,736
(♪♪♪)

401
00:33:46,769 --> 00:33:48,838
Still good at making things.

402
00:33:48,871 --> 00:33:52,709
(♪♪♪)

403
00:33:52,742 --> 00:33:56,345
I haven't been told that
in a long time.

404
00:33:56,378 --> 00:33:59,181
You don't still make things
where you're from?

405
00:33:59,214 --> 00:34:00,650
Not really.

406
00:34:00,683 --> 00:34:02,752
(♪♪♪)

407
00:34:02,785 --> 00:34:05,287
We say I do...

408
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,624
I want to.

409
00:34:07,657 --> 00:34:09,358
But it's hard.

410
00:34:09,391 --> 00:34:11,493
(♪♪♪)

411
00:34:11,526 --> 00:34:14,229
I don't see
why you couldn't do so now.

412
00:34:14,262 --> 00:34:20,770
(♪♪♪)

413
00:34:20,803 --> 00:34:22,005
Sometimes the world
seems like

414
00:34:22,038 --> 00:34:25,540
if you're not built right
it's designed to hurt you.

415
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:35,918
That sounds terrible.

416
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:53,803
(♪♪♪)

417
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:19,528
(train bell clanging)

418
00:35:22,665 --> 00:35:24,299
It's Vera.

419
00:35:24,332 --> 00:35:28,771
I was... I was just callin'
to see how you're doin'.

420
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:30,940
And it just seems like
you kind of disappeared

421
00:35:30,973 --> 00:35:33,408
these past few months.

422
00:35:38,781 --> 00:35:39,916
Hey.

423
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,485
Hey.

424
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,024
You called back.

425
00:35:48,057 --> 00:35:49,726
I did.

426
00:35:52,461 --> 00:35:54,797
(soft crackling sound)

427
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:10,245
What's happening
to that thing?

428
00:36:13,816 --> 00:36:16,418
The forest is taking it back.

429
00:36:21,724 --> 00:36:23,926
That's terrifying.

430
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:28,363
It's just becoming
something else.

431
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:38,708
Why didn't you leave the woods
with the rest of your family?

432
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:48,885
I'm sorry.

433
00:36:48,918 --> 00:36:51,386
I didn't mean
to upset you.

434
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:55,825
There's nothing
to be sorry for.

435
00:36:57,425 --> 00:36:59,796
I should have had more tact.

436
00:37:01,563 --> 00:37:05,400
It's hard for me sometimes.

437
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,936
I say the wrong thing
and then fuck up

438
00:37:06,969 --> 00:37:09,672
what I'm actually
trying to say.

439
00:37:12,507 --> 00:37:14,844
I don't think
you fuck anything up.

440
00:37:16,579 --> 00:37:17,713
(Brynn laughs softly)

441
00:37:20,817 --> 00:37:21,951
What?

442
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:25,721
It's just funny
to hear you swear.

443
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:28,891
You seem so old-world
or something.

444
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,525
I like it.

445
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:33,696
You do?

446
00:37:33,729 --> 00:37:34,931
Yeah.

447
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:39,969
Fuck.

448
00:37:40,002 --> 00:37:41,737
(laughing)

449
00:37:43,806 --> 00:37:45,007
Fuck!

450
00:37:45,041 --> 00:37:48,611
(laughing)

451
00:38:04,026 --> 00:38:05,027
Oh, shit.

452
00:38:06,729 --> 00:38:08,931
What time is it?

453
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:11,601
I completely lost track.

454
00:38:11,634 --> 00:38:13,401
Is that bad?

455
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:15,470
I've been gone
since before Laika woke up.

456
00:38:15,503 --> 00:38:18,506
He might be worried.

457
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:21,677
Would he worry?

458
00:38:21,711 --> 00:38:23,579
Probably.

459
00:38:24,947 --> 00:38:28,784
He seems somewhat...
unconcerned to me.

460
00:38:28,818 --> 00:38:30,820
Well...

461
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:33,555
you're wrong.

462
00:38:33,589 --> 00:38:35,892
Okay.

463
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:37,994
Look, I just...
I need to get back.

464
00:38:38,027 --> 00:38:39,996
Can you please take me back...

465
00:38:40,029 --> 00:38:42,665
to the normal forest?

466
00:38:42,698 --> 00:38:44,901
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said...

467
00:38:44,934 --> 00:38:47,569
No, it's okay, I just...
I really need to get back.

468
00:38:47,603 --> 00:38:49,171
Please, can we go?

469
00:38:59,215 --> 00:39:00,917
(footsteps rustling)

470
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,184
Do you want me
to walk you back?

471
00:39:02,218 --> 00:39:04,020
No, it's fine,
I just need to get back.

472
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:07,023
- Just hold on for a second.
- Don't fucking grab me!

473
00:39:07,056 --> 00:39:09,659
(smoke bellowing)

474
00:39:20,202 --> 00:39:22,738
(crickets chirring)

475
00:39:34,516 --> 00:39:35,985
Hey.

476
00:39:36,018 --> 00:39:37,620
Where the hell you been?

477
00:39:37,653 --> 00:39:40,623
I'm sorry, I was in the woods
with Rue all day.

478
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:42,224
You wanna wait
for me to wake up

479
00:39:42,258 --> 00:39:44,994
next time you decide
to disappear?

480
00:39:45,027 --> 00:39:49,031
Look, I'm sorry,
I know I lost track of time.

481
00:39:49,065 --> 00:39:52,034
I thought we were coming
out here to chill out,

482
00:39:52,068 --> 00:39:54,637
not for you to hang out
with some dude in a fucking mask

483
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,972
all day.

484
00:39:56,005 --> 00:39:58,808
Okay, he's... he's not some... dude
in a mask.

485
00:39:58,841 --> 00:40:00,609
You don't know what he is

486
00:40:00,643 --> 00:40:02,845
because all he does
is talk in circles.

487
00:40:02,878 --> 00:40:05,915
He never says anything real.

488
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,685
Fuck you.

489
00:40:11,921 --> 00:40:13,055
(sighs)

490
00:40:13,089 --> 00:40:15,091
(door opens, closes)

491
00:40:27,870 --> 00:40:29,872
Look, I'm really sorry.

492
00:40:29,905 --> 00:40:31,573
I didn't mean to worry you.

493
00:40:31,607 --> 00:40:34,810
I should have kept
better track of time.

494
00:40:34,844 --> 00:40:36,145
Yeah, you fucking should have.

495
00:40:36,178 --> 00:40:38,047
Don't...

496
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,716
Look, I'm fucking trying
to apologize,

497
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:43,285
and you insist on continuing
to be an asshole.

498
00:40:43,319 --> 00:40:44,854
I'm not being an asshole.

499
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:46,856
I'm pissed.
I'm not being an asshole.

500
00:40:46,889 --> 00:40:48,691
What is this,
are you jealous

501
00:40:48,724 --> 00:40:50,793
that I'm... that I'm
in the woods with Rue?

502
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:52,995
- Is that what this is?
- I'm not anything.

503
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:54,296
You just said you were pissed.

504
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,765
Well, what were you guys
even doing?

505
00:40:55,798 --> 00:40:57,700
Were you just out there
touching trees and shit?

506
00:40:57,733 --> 00:40:58,566
Yeah.

507
00:40:58,601 --> 00:41:00,568
Yeah, we fucking...
we touched trees.

508
00:41:00,603 --> 00:41:01,569
It was great.

509
00:41:01,604 --> 00:41:02,872
Um, I'm gonna go to bed.

510
00:41:02,905 --> 00:41:04,707
Yeah, I'm going to bed too.

511
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,708
- What?
- Yeah.

512
00:41:05,741 --> 00:41:06,642
Maybe you'll hate-fuck me.

513
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:09,111
Is that the only way
I can get laid anymore?

514
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:14,817
Oh.

515
00:41:16,919 --> 00:41:19,955
So... so that's what this is?

516
00:41:19,989 --> 00:41:21,690
I'm just saying,
like, we don't...

517
00:41:21,724 --> 00:41:22,892
No, you...

518
00:41:22,925 --> 00:41:25,694
you said
what you're just saying.

519
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:26,695
(sighs)

520
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:30,833
Well, I'm gonna sleep
in the car tonight.

521
00:41:30,866 --> 00:41:32,902
- Hey, wait...
- No, no, um... you know what,

522
00:41:32,935 --> 00:41:35,071
I hope you have a lot of fun
with yourself tonight

523
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:37,807
since I'm obviously
so useless to you.

524
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:39,175
Asshole.

525
00:41:39,208 --> 00:41:40,709
(door slams)

526
00:41:43,179 --> 00:41:44,380

529
00:41:49,051 --> 00:41:51,754
(groaning)

530
00:41:51,787 --> 00:41:53,122
God.

531
00:41:53,155 --> 00:41:54,723
(can opens)

532
00:41:54,757 --> 00:41:56,158
Oh...

533
00:41:56,192 --> 00:41:58,027
Fuck me!

534
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:59,028
God.

535
00:41:59,061 --> 00:42:00,362
(can smacks, door closes)

536
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,299
(sighs)

537
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:05,034
Damn it!

538
00:42:07,236 --> 00:42:08,604
(sighs)

539
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,647

(♪♪♪)

551
00:43:05,094 --> 00:43:06,695
Good morning.

552
00:43:10,766 --> 00:43:11,967
Morning.

553
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:15,771
Where are we?

554
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:17,973
I just thought we'd take
a Sunday drive

555
00:43:18,007 --> 00:43:20,976
but not on Sunday.

556
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:23,078
Whatever day this is.

557
00:43:27,283 --> 00:43:29,084
That sounds nice.

558
00:43:39,528 --> 00:43:41,730
I'm still upset.

559
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,803
I get it.

560
00:43:47,836 --> 00:43:51,340
This is a nice thing to make me
not think about that though.

561
00:43:52,374 --> 00:44:02,351
(♪♪♪)

562
00:44:02,384 --> 00:44:05,221

566
00:44:21,403 --> 00:44:23,005
Look.

567
00:44:23,038 --> 00:44:26,075
(♪♪♪)

568
00:44:26,108 --> 00:44:28,844
Some big-ass trees.

569
00:44:28,877 --> 00:44:31,113
The biggest-ass trees.

570
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:32,915
God, I love them.

571
00:44:35,017 --> 00:44:37,119
We could take one home with us.

572
00:44:37,152 --> 00:44:39,021
- Really?
- Yeah.

573
00:44:41,190 --> 00:44:43,125
(birds chirping)

574
00:44:46,996 --> 00:44:49,398
We couldn't though.

575
00:44:49,431 --> 00:44:51,400
Not really.

576
00:44:56,572 --> 00:44:59,074
We could plant one.

577
00:44:59,108 --> 00:45:01,210
Plant one?

578
00:45:01,243 --> 00:45:03,846
Yeah.

579
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:06,382
We'd have to wait
for it to grow.

580
00:45:09,885 --> 00:45:11,387
I got time.

581
00:45:14,156 --> 00:45:15,858
You have time?

582
00:45:31,874 --> 00:45:33,309
(leaves rustling)

583
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:45,888
(ambient whirring)

584
00:45:57,066 --> 00:45:59,001

00:46:08,911 --> 00:46:10,245
(door closes)

587
00:46:23,292 --> 00:46:26,128
Um...

588
00:46:26,161 --> 00:46:28,931
I'm sorry...

589
00:46:28,964 --> 00:46:32,234
for, uh... last night.

590
00:46:32,267 --> 00:46:35,204
I know.

591
00:46:35,237 --> 00:46:37,973
I get it, I know things
have been weird.

592
00:46:38,006 --> 00:46:39,975
Yeah.

593
00:46:40,008 --> 00:46:43,479
It's been...
it's been really weird.

594
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:46,014
And...

595
00:46:46,048 --> 00:46:47,416
Can we...

596
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:49,686
Can we just spend some...

597
00:46:49,719 --> 00:46:54,423
Can we just hang out, just us,
the last few days, you know?

598
00:46:54,456 --> 00:46:57,226
You mean, without Rue.

599
00:46:57,259 --> 00:47:00,630
I... I just don't think you should
spend that much time with him.

600
00:47:06,101 --> 00:47:07,536
Fine.

601
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:11,340
If that's what you want.

602
00:47:13,409 --> 00:47:14,510
Okay.

603
00:47:48,143 --> 00:47:51,614
(deep breaths)

604
00:47:58,788 --> 00:48:08,731

00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:03,252
(footsteps rustling)

608
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:15,798
Hey.

609
00:49:18,433 --> 00:49:20,703
I'm sorry about what I did.

610
00:49:20,737 --> 00:49:22,772
You didn't deserve that.

611
00:49:24,674 --> 00:49:28,377
I shouldn't have tried
to make you stay.

612
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,213
I understand
why you were angry.

613
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:39,254
That doesn't change
how I responded.

614
00:49:41,456 --> 00:49:44,493
Is your face okay?

615
00:49:44,526 --> 00:49:45,795
Yeah.

616
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:49,732
Did I hurt you?

617
00:49:51,233 --> 00:49:52,568
No.

618
00:50:00,242 --> 00:50:03,412
This place isn't like anything.

619
00:50:03,445 --> 00:50:06,248
It's like...

620
00:50:06,281 --> 00:50:08,851
the absence of things.

621
00:50:10,385 --> 00:50:12,321
That's true.

622
00:50:15,825 --> 00:50:19,461
It's like...

623
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:21,430
what could be.

624
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,534
What could be?

625
00:50:27,202 --> 00:50:28,638
I don't know.

626
00:50:30,305 --> 00:50:32,240
Anything.

627
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:43,318
(crow squawking)

628
00:50:43,352 --> 00:50:45,688

630
00:50:54,196 --> 00:50:56,531
Hey, morning.

631
00:50:56,565 --> 00:50:57,867
Hi.

632
00:51:00,937 --> 00:51:03,205
You been up for a while?

633
00:51:05,775 --> 00:51:08,176
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

634
00:51:09,378 --> 00:51:10,713
Huh.

635
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:20,657
(gentle footsteps)

636
00:51:20,690 --> 00:51:30,633

644
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:31,453
Morning.

646
00:53:33,656 --> 00:53:34,690

(♪♪♪)

650
00:54:02,652 --> 00:54:05,054
What's happening to your arm?

651
00:54:06,388 --> 00:54:09,058
Nothing to be concerned about.

652
00:54:44,894 --> 00:54:46,662
Can I?

653
00:54:53,603 --> 00:54:55,370
It's okay.

654
00:55:06,215 --> 00:55:08,751
(smoke bellowing)

655
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:17,994
When you first arrived here,
I saw you playing in the woods,

656
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:20,663
but you couldn't see me.

657
00:55:20,696 --> 00:55:22,732
I didn't have a form
like you did.

658
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:28,671
So, all of this...

659
00:55:29,772 --> 00:55:32,407
I wanted you to see me.

660
00:55:37,545 --> 00:55:38,814
Oh.

661
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:03,538

664
00:56:39,041 --> 00:56:42,510
You can just stay
in the forest tomorrow night.

Hey.

00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,286
Hey.

672
00:58:33,189 --> 00:58:35,224
Um...

673
00:58:35,257 --> 00:58:37,326
how's everything going?

674
00:58:42,965 --> 00:58:44,700
It's okay.

675
00:58:50,439 --> 00:58:51,841
Um...

676
00:58:56,412 --> 00:58:58,347
I gotta talk to you.

677
00:59:03,285 --> 00:59:05,087
Okay.

678
00:59:06,155 --> 00:59:07,990
I don't...

679
00:59:08,023 --> 00:59:09,358
(sighs)

680
00:59:14,296 --> 00:59:15,965
- I...
- Just say it.

681
00:59:19,001 --> 00:59:21,137
I...

682
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:24,373
I don't think we should...
do this anymore.

683
00:59:34,383 --> 00:59:36,085
Okay.

684
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:42,758
I think maybe...
you have some things

685
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:44,960
you can figure out
on your own, and...

686
00:59:47,263 --> 00:59:50,166
...I thought I could help
with that, but...

687
00:59:52,234 --> 00:59:55,371
...I just make things worse.

688
00:59:55,404 --> 00:59:57,339
You don't.

689
01:00:00,309 --> 01:00:01,844
I feel like I do.

690
01:00:05,848 --> 01:00:07,249
(sniffles)

691
01:00:11,253 --> 01:00:14,023
Well, we...
you can't take my car,

692
01:00:14,056 --> 01:00:16,425
so it's a good thing
you did this now.

693
01:00:16,458 --> 01:00:20,996
I'm just...
I'm gonna take the bus back.

694
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:25,134
If you could...
drive me to the stop,

695
01:00:25,167 --> 01:00:27,870
maybe?

696
01:00:27,903 --> 01:00:29,772
Let's go.

697
01:00:46,055 --> 01:00:47,756

698
01:00:48,824 --> 01:00:50,759

(sighs, door closes)

701
01:01:00,536 --> 01:01:02,371
This is yours.

702
01:01:07,076 --> 01:01:09,545
(keys jingling)

703
01:01:09,578 --> 01:01:10,946

704
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:13,315

01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:15,217
(truck honking)

706
01:01:29,965 --> 01:01:31,300
Bye.

707
01:01:32,501 --> 01:01:33,936
Bye.

708
01:02:16,478 --> 01:02:19,214
(crinkling)

709
01:02:38,967 --> 01:02:40,536
Oh.

710
01:02:40,569 --> 01:02:42,171
Hi.

711
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:45,441
Hi.

712
01:02:48,277 --> 01:02:50,212
How are you doing?

713
01:02:55,451 --> 01:02:57,386
Not super great.

714
01:02:59,355 --> 01:03:01,290
I'm sorry.

715
01:03:10,366 --> 01:03:12,167
Laika left.

716
01:03:15,404 --> 01:03:17,139
I know.

717
01:03:18,273 --> 01:03:20,442
I'm sorry that happened.

718
01:03:24,012 --> 01:03:26,882
I don't think you are, but...

719
01:03:28,550 --> 01:03:31,153
Needed to happen, I guess.

720
01:03:33,355 --> 01:03:35,023
I am sorry.

721
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:39,962
You found an oasis
after you grew up.

722
01:03:43,232 --> 01:03:46,335
I think that's why
there's tension between us.

723
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,339
It's hard to know
that someone you loved

724
01:03:50,372 --> 01:03:52,675
lives in someone else now.

725
01:04:00,717 --> 01:04:03,252
I was so happy as a kid.

726
01:04:07,156 --> 01:04:09,091
Then I grew up and I...

727
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:13,996
...felt ruined,

728
01:04:14,029 --> 01:04:17,734
felt like I'd changed, and I...

729
01:04:17,767 --> 01:04:20,436
I didn't get a choice in it.

730
01:04:23,272 --> 01:04:31,380
(♪♪♪)

731
01:04:31,413 --> 01:04:35,384
When it was good,

732
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:39,722
you made it seem like
that was okay to feel that way.

733

(♪♪♪)

734
01:04:41,691 --> 01:04:45,294
That's just how life was.

735
01:04:45,327 --> 01:04:48,030
I'd share it with somebody.

736

(♪♪♪)

737
01:04:51,066 --> 01:04:53,469

739
01:04:56,706 --> 01:04:59,441
I don't think
that you're ruined.

741
01:05:05,615 --> 01:05:07,584

746
01:05:24,634 --> 01:05:28,070
I was walking in the woods,

747
01:05:28,103 --> 01:05:30,539
and...

748
01:05:30,572 --> 01:05:32,775
(exhales)

749
01:05:32,809 --> 01:05:35,511
...I got to the pond.

750
01:05:35,544 --> 01:05:37,546
- Are you...
- And...

751
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:41,216
Are you trying to come up
with something right now?

752
01:05:41,250 --> 01:05:43,686
(wind howling)

753
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:45,254
No.

754
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:48,524
Well, you're not very good
at it, so don't do it.

755
01:05:48,557 --> 01:05:51,728
Just tell me what's going on.

756
01:06:03,438 --> 01:06:05,775
(crackling)

757
01:06:12,381 --> 01:06:14,617
Follow me.

758
01:06:22,157 --> 01:06:25,093
(ambient rumbling, crackling)

759
01:07:07,269 --> 01:07:10,305
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

760
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:15,377
I understand.

761
01:07:23,418 --> 01:07:26,288
Just so fucking exhausted.

762
01:07:36,398 --> 01:07:38,635
Are you afraid?

763
01:07:41,236 --> 01:07:42,204
Yeah.

764
01:07:45,608 --> 01:07:48,577
Well, can't you do anything
about it?

765
01:07:48,611 --> 01:07:51,648
I don't have the answers, Brynn.

766
01:07:51,681 --> 01:07:55,818
What about your family,
where are they?

767
01:08:00,857 --> 01:08:04,259
Maybe it already took them.

768
01:08:04,292 --> 01:08:08,230
Maybe that's why they left
in the first place.

769
01:08:08,263 --> 01:08:11,634
They knew our home
would get eaten up.

770
01:08:11,668 --> 01:08:14,503
They just never thought
to tell me.

771
01:08:26,548 --> 01:08:29,686
I've been here
for a very long time,

772
01:08:29,719 --> 01:08:33,555
not doing much of anything,

773
01:08:33,589 --> 01:08:36,491
and it's probably a good thing.

774
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:43,331
That's not true.

775
01:08:43,365 --> 01:08:47,603
You've been taking care
of an entire forest by yourself.

776
01:08:49,337 --> 01:08:52,340
Maybe.

777
01:08:52,374 --> 01:08:54,711
Or maybe I've just
been fooling myself

778
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:57,880
into thinking
the forest needed me.

779
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:03,886
You're important.

780
01:09:14,664 --> 01:09:18,467
I'm sorry I couldn't make you
a new home here.

781
01:09:28,376 --> 01:09:30,880
That's not your job.

782
01:09:33,950 --> 01:09:36,786
(ambient rumbling, crackling)

783
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:46,763
(♪♪♪)

784
01:10:01,978 --> 01:10:04,580
I need you to take something.
