right there.

176
00:09:33,181 --> 00:09:37,054
He just sired

- Yeah, it's my mother's name.

180
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,844

the name's Bob.

- So where's Lucinda?

184
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:56,639
- Lucinda's back at the barn.
Her mother died of some disease.

185
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,772
She's got no mom
to suckle.

186

and she won't eat.

to keep her going.

on her.

Better yet, tell him.

eating much, is she?

00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,857
- What are we gonna do?

218
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,685
I don't even want to think
about putting her down.

219

- I don't think so.

220
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,343
You gave her
your grandma's name.

what to do, Madison.

Just being neighborly.

247

Your dad and I went
to school together

when he was the runt and I was
captain of the football team.

if me and my people

But, uh...I guess
I'd have to say no.

- That's it?
Just no?

when he asked you
to leave the property, Cody.

262
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,515
- You really might want
to think about it, Bobby.

263
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,474
- Why don't you go on
in the house, honey.

264
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:44,606
- Or she can come with me.

265

Bobby?

- Cody McMichael.

269
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,882
I actually dated him
when I got here

'til I found out
he was married.

271
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,322
Looking back, I suspect
all he really wanted

272
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,281
was to buy my land.

273
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:10,327

and I had a great connection...

coming back.

I didn't want to come.

Not everybody wants to.

old man.

back here.

surveyors to test for a well?

my advice...

[Panting]

704
00:44:06,382 --> 00:44:09,559
What?

705
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,387
Ok, if you don't like 'em
together,

706
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:13,085
I can make grilled cheese.

707
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,348
- Come here, come here,
Madison.

708
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,438
Know what. I just want you
to stand here, ok.

709
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:21,484
Just don't move and keep talking
to mama here like you were.

710
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,661
Ok?
- Ok.

711
00:44:25,184 --> 00:44:26,620
- Hey.

712
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:30,711
You all right?
[Wolf moans]

713
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:35,368
It's ok. It's ok.

714
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:38,414
It's ok.

715
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:39,502
- Keep talking. That's good.

716
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,766
- Yeah, you're ok.

717
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,551
- There you go.
- You're all right.

718
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:49,687
Good girl.

719
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,912
[Tapping keys]

720
00:44:58,086 --> 00:45:02,787
Dear dawn, you know how people
say nothing lasts forever?

721
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,180
Let me tell you,
it's so true, girl.

722
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:07,705
Things have changed a lot
since we came here.

723
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:09,184
Dad's doing great,

724
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:11,360
although he's crazy busy
these days.

725
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,623
He comes in after working
all day,

726
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:16,888
eats dinner and stays up
all night guarding the animals.

727
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:20,500
We had two mustangs killed.
It was awful.

728
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:22,676
Dad only sleeps
a couple of hours

729
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,199
right when the sun
comes up.

730
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:25,635
I don't know how he does it,

731
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,725
but I don't care because
he's happier

732
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,378
than I've ever seen him
in a long time.

733
00:45:29,552 --> 00:45:31,163
I've changed too.

734
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:34,166
When we got here, I'd never been
on a horse before.

735
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,690
And now you can't get me
off one.

736
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:38,474
I spend as much time
as I can riding,

737
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,215
and even Hank says
I'm turning into

738
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:41,739
a pretty good horsewoman.

739
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:44,219
That's what he calls me.
Can you imagine?

740
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:47,396
I haven't bought
a cowboy hat yet, but who knows.

741
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,747
Maybe I will.
Would you still talk to me?

742
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:57,363
And I wish you could see
the wolf pups.

743
00:45:57,537 --> 00:46:00,409
They're growing so fast!
Believe me, they're adorable!

744
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:04,674
And a big responsibility.

745
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,112
Emily says that without
their mom

746
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:08,853
to teach them
for the time being,

747
00:46:09,027 --> 00:46:11,246
it's up to us
to keep them active and strong.

748
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,249
She leaves most of that to me.
Well, Tim and me.

749
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:16,425
He's got a really good way
with animals,

750
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,645
and Emily says
we make a good team.

751
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,908
I think all three of us do.

752
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:24,216
Five, if you count
Montana and Indiana.

753
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,783
[Low growling]

754
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:28,263
As much as I love
working with them,

755
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:29,743
I don't like to think about

756
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,527
Dakota getting well
for very long.

757
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:33,747
I know she needs to take
her family back to their home,

758
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:36,489
but I don't know
what I'll do when they're gone.

759
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:39,492
[Sighs]
Onto other things.

760
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:40,798
Remember our favorite spot
at Zuma beach

761
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,669
near lifeguard stand 40?

762
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:45,019
Well, I'm a long way from there,
chick,

763
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:47,979
but I do have a favorite spot
to swim on hot afternoons.

764
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:49,850
And we get plenty of those,
I can tell you.

765
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:51,460
There's not a lifeguard,

766
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:53,375
but I don't really need one
with Tim around.

767
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:58,946
Oh, and my dad's
doing great at work.

768
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,732
His job's a lot easier
than it was in L.A.,

769
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,734
and I think he really likes it

770
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:07,302
that it's mainly about
helping people here,

771
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:10,349
instead of chasing bad guys.

772
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:12,612
One more thing...

773
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,483
you'll really think
I'm a hillbilly,

774
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:16,616
but I don't care.
[Laughs]

775
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,400
I learned how to milk a cow.

776
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:20,315
Stop laughing!

777
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:22,143
It was pretty cool,

778
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:25,712
but I don't think I'll be
like a milkmaid or anything.

779
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:29,411
Tim taught me how to do it.
Tim.

780
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:32,850
You know, I wouldn't have
talked to him back at school,

781
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:37,332
but there's something
so good about him.

782
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:43,469
He's cute, too,
with his cowboy hat and boots.

784
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:47,342
And funny!
He makes me laugh.

That's all for now, Madison.

- Arliss.
- Uh...[Laughs]

789
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,396
Glenda here says
you wanted to see me.

790
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,311
- Take a load off.

791
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:00,878
- Well, Iâ€™s...
- sit down.

792
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,534
- Right.

793

[Sighs]
Yes, sir?

794
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,669
- You know, arliss, Iâ€™m
beginning to think

795
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:11,801
that fire was no accident.

796
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,542
- Bobby, this ain't
no los ang-eles.

797
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:15,588
- Maybe not, but that fire
was no accident.

798
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:17,807
- Oh, for goodness sake.

799
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,679
Sam can't even remember
what he had for breakfast

800
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,637
this morning.

801
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,074
Let me see,
about two months ago

802
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:24,597
he had a short
in one of them machines,

803
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,512
and it started smoking.

804
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:28,818
And I said, "Sam, you better
get rid of all this junk!"

805
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,343
Bobby, that place
was a fire trap.

806
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:32,735
- Hmm.

807
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:38,741
- Excuse me.
Are those the land deals?

808
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,613
- Yep.

809
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:43,616
- What? You just went
and took 'em out of my office?

810
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,618
- Arliss, these aren't
your personal files.

811
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,533
They're municipal property.

812
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:50,797
Did you know that Cody and that
bunch up in San Francisco

813
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:53,887
were trying to buy all the land
they can around here?

814
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:57,673
This isn't just about a mall,
I'll tell you that.

815
00:48:57,847 --> 00:48:59,849
- Well, I'm going to tell you
this.

I don't know what it's about,

but I do know that
I am mayor of this town

818

and that Iâ€™m, uh,
going home for lunch.

819
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,733
- Don't look at me like that.
I didn't vote for him.

- How'd that happen?
- How about that, huh?

826
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:32,752
She started eating
a few days ago just like that.

827
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:35,885
- Well, that's a miracle.
- You're not kidding.

- A blessing from above.

832
00:49:45,765 --> 00:49:48,072
- Yeah, maybe it is.

833
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:51,553
We're still going to have to
keep a watch on her though.

834
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:57,864
- Hey, dad! Dad.

835
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,474
Look at Lucinda.
She's better.

Great.

it's a sign, a blessing.

- This was a great dinner, guys.
Thanks.

00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,320
- You're welcome.

842
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:23,803

Bob's lasagna.

Well, it looks like you've got
everything under control.

pretty good bottles of wine

00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:39,471
You want to take a look at 'em
and choose one?

851
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:41,212
- Well, how about you choose,

852
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:42,691
and I'll just pretend
to know the difference.

853
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:45,912
- [Laughs]
All right.

854
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:48,045
- Let's go check on Lucinda.

855
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:08,935
What do you think
they're talking about?

856
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:12,112
- I don't know.

857
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:14,375
What? Do you want to
go spy on 'em?

858
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:15,942
Ok.

859
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,688
- I appreciate you spending
so much time with Madison.

860
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:24,211
- The pleasure is mine.

861
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:26,996
You really have
an amazing daughter.

862
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,130
She's got a connection
with that mother wolf

863
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:31,958
like I've never seen.

864
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:34,787
- Are you telling me
that she was

865
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:37,616
with those wolves today?

866
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,836
- Yeah. She said that
you were all right with it.

867
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,142
- I'm not all right with it.

868
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:44,710
- Why?
- Well, I'm just not.

869
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,886
- Well, I didn't know.

870
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,801
- I said I did not want
her getting too attached.

871
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:50,977
- Or what?

872
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:52,805
I mean, what?
She'll get hurt?

873
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:55,590
- That's right.

874
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,636
She's suffered enough loss

01:02:04,982 --> 01:02:07,071
- You have a good lunch, Glenda.
- All right.

1050
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:08,768
- Make sure that envelope
gets mailed for me.

1051
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,291
- I will.

1052
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:16,471
- Hey.
- Hey.

1053
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:18,604
- The diner makes
the best lemonade around.

1054
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:21,476
My treat?
- Sure.

1055
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:24,784
- I was out of line
the other night,

1056
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,439
and I wanted to apologize.

1057
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:30,485
- I ought to be
apologizing.

1058
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:32,183
- No, you're her dad,

1059
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,837
and I should respect
your decision.

1060
01:02:34,011 --> 01:02:35,621
- I thought a lot
about what you said.

1061
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:36,970
I don't want to
break her spirit.

1062
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:39,973
Why else do you think
I let her

1063
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:41,496
keep going back
to your place?

1064
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,281
- You knew.
- Hey, I'm the sheriff.

1065
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,586
- Yeah.
[Laughs]

1066
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:48,547
Well, the wolves are ready
to be released.

1067
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:51,680
Could I borrow Hank tomorrow?
- Sure.

1068
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,118
- Just so you know,
Madison's fine with it.

1069
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,423
- Good.

1070
01:02:57,425 --> 01:03:00,472
Well, I've got to get back
to work.

1071
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:02,169
Thanks for the lemonade.

1072
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:06,739
- Hey.

1073
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:11,439
Everything is ok
between us?

1074
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:15,226
- I think so.
Yeah.

1075
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,271
- Ok. Good.

1076
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:20,492
- Good.

1077
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:24,148
- Everything's going to be
all right.

1078
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:28,108
You're a sign, Lucinda.
A blessing.

1079
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:32,678
And the wolves are just...
they belong in the mountains.

1080
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:35,812
They're wild.

1081
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:37,901
And they're just
going home tomorrow.

1082
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:39,598
Everything's going to be
all right,

1083
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:41,034
and I'm not going to cry.

1084
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,603
[Horse snorts]
Yeah, I promised myself.

1085
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:54,308
- How are those wolf pups doing?

1086
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:57,398
- You mad at me?

1087
01:03:57,572 --> 01:04:00,749
- [Sighs]
How could I be mad at you?

1088

I'm so glad we came here.

1090
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:12,326
I am.

1091
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,329
And I'm ok about
the wolves leaving.

1092
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:19,943
I just... I just
have to cry about it.

1093
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:22,293
And that's ok, right?
- It's ok.

1094
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:27,515
- [Sniffling]

1095
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:28,647
Dad?

1096
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:30,779
When you... when you cry,

1097
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:33,173
will you let me hold you
like this?

1098
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:35,959
I just...

1099
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:38,439
I just think that if
you let me hold you

1100
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:41,878
that it won't hurt so much.

1101

- [Sighs]

1102
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:49,755
- Do you remember when
Gus carved that?

1103
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:52,236
- Hmm. Yep.

1104
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:56,631
After he was thrown by
that big old bay stallion.

1105
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:59,547
- [Sighs] Broke his hip,
got right back on.

1106

forget it either.

- [Laughs]
That's how legends are made.

1108
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,686
- You remember how many people
he threatened

1109
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,948
to hit over the head
with this thing?

1110
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,908
- Oh, over 100.
- Yeah.

1111
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:15,346
That's what legends
are made of.

1112

He looks it, doesn't he?

1113
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:23,615
Handsome devil.

1114
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:25,965
- You know, Bob,

1115
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:31,797
taking on his legacy
is not a bad thing.

1116
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:37,846
- Maybe not.

1117
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,848
- Hey, they're going to
have corn beef and cabbage.

1118
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,634
$2.50, and it's good!
I'm going to see you there.

1119
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,723
[Laughs]
- Morning, arliss.

1120
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:49,162
- Morning.

1121
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:53,384
- You know, this belongs
to your son-in-law.

1122
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:54,689
- It does?

1123
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:57,866
- Arson's a serious crime.

1124
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,738
- Oh, see, I don't know
anything about that.

1125
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:00,782
- What about silver?

1126
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,741
- Silver?

1127
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:06,049
- Dry drilling,
killing some horses.

1128
01:06:06,223 --> 01:06:08,573
- I don't know anything
about that.

1129
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:09,530
- I wonder if Cody does.

1130
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,010
Where is he?

1131
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,447

Bobby, I have no idea.

You know, arliss,
for a politician

1134
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:18,713
you're not a very good liar.

1135
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:20,715
- Well, he left town
yesterday.

1136
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:22,152
- Well, that's all right.

1137
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:23,718
I'll arrest him
when he gets back.

1138
01:06:23,892 --> 01:06:25,590
Him and anybody else
who's involved.

- Yeah, arliss, what is it?
- You just shut up and listen.

1144
01:06:39,821 --> 01:06:41,301
- What? What do you want?

1145
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:43,521
- When you come back,
don't go into town.

1146
01:06:43,695 --> 01:06:44,957
- Ok, where then?

1147
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:46,698
- Meet me... meet me at the mine.
- Where?

1148
01:06:46,872 --> 01:06:48,656
- The mine.
- All right.

walk back down on my own

Pretty neat, huh?

is not a good idea.

give you a black eye.
