- Yeah, it's my mother's name.

180
00:09:42,407 --> 00:09:43,844
The little one there,

the runt,
the name's Bob.

- So where's Lucinda?

184
00:09:51,765 --> 00:09:56,639
- Lucinda's back at the barn.
Her mother died of some disease.

185
00:09:56,813 --> 00:09:58,772
She's got no mom
to suckle.

186

and she won't eat.

to keep her going.

on her.

set your watch by this vet.

Better yet, tell him.

eating much, is she?

00:11:22,072 --> 00:11:23,857
- What are we gonna do?

218
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,685
I don't even want to think
about putting her down.

219
00:11:27,556 --> 00:11:28,557
- I don't think so.

220
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,343
You gave her
your grandma's name.

221

what to do, Madison.

Just being neighborly.

247

Your dad and I went
to school together

when he was the runt and I was
captain of the football team.

Bobby...

254
00:13:15,751 --> 00:13:18,101
What would you say
if me and my people

But, uh...I guess
I'd have to say no.

00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:32,724
- That's it?
Just no?

260
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:34,944

261
00:13:35,118 --> 00:13:37,947
when he asked you
to leave the property, Cody.

262
00:13:38,121 --> 00:13:40,515
- You really might want
to think about it, Bobby.

263
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:43,474
- Why don't you go on
in the house, honey.

264
00:13:43,648 --> 00:13:44,606
- Or she can come with me.

265

Bobby?

Make you a good offer.

00:13:56,444 --> 00:13:57,793
- Cody McMichael.

269
00:13:57,967 --> 00:13:59,882
I actually dated him
when I got here

'til I found out
he was married.

271
00:14:03,016 --> 00:14:05,322
Looking back, I suspect
all he really wanted

272
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:07,281
was to buy my land.

273
00:14:07,455 --> 00:14:10,327

and I had a great connection...

coming back.

I didn't want to come.

- Well, not everybody
can live in Los Angeles.

Not everybody wants to.

old man.

But you finally got me
back here.

surveyors to test for a well?

- No. Not that I know of.

289

unpacking.

tell her you're here.

to scare you.

Your daddy used to
come down here at night

it broke his heart,

my advice...

What?

705
00:44:09,734 --> 00:44:11,387
Ok, if you don't like 'em
together,

706
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:13,085
I can make grilled cheese.

707
00:44:13,259 --> 00:44:15,348
- Come here, come here,
Madison.

708
00:44:15,522 --> 00:44:18,438
Know what. I just want you
to stand here, ok.

709
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:21,484
Just don't move and keep talking
to mama here like you were.

710
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,661
Ok?
- Ok.

711
00:44:25,184 --> 00:44:26,620
- Hey.

712
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:30,711
You all right?
[Wolf moans]

713
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:35,368
It's ok. It's ok.

714
00:44:35,542 --> 00:44:38,414
It's ok.

715
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:39,502
- Keep talking. That's good.

716
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,766
- Yeah, you're ok.

717
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:44,551
- There you go.
- You're all right.

718
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:49,687
Good girl.

719
00:44:55,518 --> 00:44:57,912
[Tapping keys]

720
00:44:58,086 --> 00:45:02,787
Dear dawn, you know how people
say nothing lasts forever?

721
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,180
Let me tell you,
it's so true, girl.

722
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:07,705
Things have changed a lot
since we came here.

723
00:45:07,879 --> 00:45:09,184
Dad's doing great,

724
00:45:09,358 --> 00:45:11,360
although he's crazy busy
these days.

725
00:45:11,534 --> 00:45:13,623
He comes in after working
all day,

726
00:45:13,798 --> 00:45:16,888
eats dinner and stays up
all night guarding the animals.

727
00:45:17,062 --> 00:45:20,500
We had two mustangs killed.
It was awful.

728
00:45:20,674 --> 00:45:22,676
Dad only sleeps
a couple of hours

729
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,199
right when the sun
comes up.

730
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:25,635
I don't know how he does it,

731
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:27,725
but I don't care because
he's happier

732
00:45:27,899 --> 00:45:29,378
than I've ever seen him
in a long time.

733
00:45:29,552 --> 00:45:31,163
I've changed too.

734
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:34,166
When we got here, I'd never been
on a horse before.

735
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,690
And now you can't get me
off one.

736
00:45:36,864 --> 00:45:38,474
I spend as much time
as I can riding,

737
00:45:38,648 --> 00:45:40,215
and even Hank says
I'm turning into

738
00:45:40,389 --> 00:45:41,739
a pretty good horsewoman.

739
00:45:41,913 --> 00:45:44,219
That's what he calls me.
Can you imagine?

740
00:45:44,393 --> 00:45:47,396
I haven't bought
a cowboy hat yet, but who knows.

741
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,747
Maybe I will.
Would you still talk to me?

742
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:57,363
And I wish you could see
the wolf pups.

743
00:45:57,537 --> 00:46:00,409
They're growing so fast!
Believe me, they're adorable!

744
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:04,674
And a big responsibility.

745
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:07,112
Emily says that without
their mom

746
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:08,853
to teach them
for the time being,

747
00:46:09,027 --> 00:46:11,246
it's up to us
to keep them active and strong.

748
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:14,249
She leaves most of that to me.
Well, Tim and me.

749
00:46:14,423 --> 00:46:16,425
He's got a really good way
with animals,

750
00:46:16,599 --> 00:46:18,645
and Emily says
we make a good team.

751
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,908
I think all three of us do.

752
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:24,216
Five, if you count
Montana and Indiana.

753
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:25,783
[Low growling]

754
00:46:25,957 --> 00:46:28,263
As much as I love
working with them,

755
00:46:28,437 --> 00:46:29,743
I don't like to think about

756
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:31,527
Dakota getting well
for very long.

757
00:46:31,701 --> 00:46:33,747
I know she needs to take
her family back to their home,

758
00:46:33,921 --> 00:46:36,489
but I don't know
what I'll do when they're gone.

759
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:39,492
[Sighs]
Onto other things.

760
00:46:39,666 --> 00:46:40,798
Remember our favorite spot
at Zuma beach

761
00:46:40,972 --> 00:46:42,669
near lifeguard stand 40?

762
00:46:42,843 --> 00:46:45,019
Well, I'm a long way from there,
chick,

763
00:46:45,193 --> 00:46:47,979
but I do have a favorite spot
to swim on hot afternoons.

764
00:46:48,153 --> 00:46:49,850
And we get plenty of those,
I can tell you.

765
00:46:50,024 --> 00:46:51,460
There's not a lifeguard,

766
00:46:51,634 --> 00:46:53,375
but I don't really need one
with Tim around.

767
00:46:55,987 --> 00:46:58,946
Oh, and my dad's
doing great at work.

768
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:02,732
His job's a lot easier
than it was in L.A.,

769
00:47:02,907 --> 00:47:04,734
and I think he really likes it

770
00:47:04,909 --> 00:47:07,302
that it's mainly about
helping people here,

771
00:47:07,476 --> 00:47:10,349
instead of chasing bad guys.

772
00:47:10,523 --> 00:47:12,612
One more thing...

773
00:47:12,786 --> 00:47:14,483
you'll really think
I'm a hillbilly,

774
00:47:14,657 --> 00:47:16,616
but I don't care.
[Laughs]

775
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:18,400
I learned how to milk a cow.

776
00:47:18,574 --> 00:47:20,315
Stop laughing!

777
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:22,143
It was pretty cool,

778
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:25,712
but I don't think I'll be
like a milkmaid or anything.

779
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:29,411
Tim taught me how to do it.
Tim.

780
00:47:29,585 --> 00:47:32,850
You know, I wouldn't have
talked to him back at school,

781
00:47:33,024 --> 00:47:37,332
but there's something
so good about him.

782
00:47:37,506 --> 00:47:43,469
He's cute, too,
with his cowboy hat and boots.

784
00:47:45,514 --> 00:47:47,342
And funny!
He makes me laugh.

That's all for now, Madison.

00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:55,611
- Arliss.
- Uh...[Laughs]

789
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,396
Glenda here says
you wanted to see me.

790
00:47:57,570 --> 00:47:59,311
- Take a load off.

791
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:00,878
- Well, I’s...
- sit down.

792
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:05,534
- Right.
[Laughs]

793
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:07,362
[Sighs]
Yes, sir?

794
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:09,669
- You know, arliss, I’m
beginning to think

795
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:11,801
that fire was no accident.

796
00:48:11,976 --> 00:48:13,542
- Bobby, this ain't
no los ang-eles.

797
00:48:13,716 --> 00:48:15,588
- Maybe not, but that fire
was no accident.

798
00:48:15,762 --> 00:48:17,807
- Oh, for goodness sake.

799
00:48:17,982 --> 00:48:19,679
Sam can't even remember
what he had for breakfast

800
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:21,637
this morning.

801
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,074
Let me see,
about two months ago

802
00:48:23,248 --> 00:48:24,597
he had a short
in one of them machines,

803
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,512
and it started smoking.

804
00:48:26,686 --> 00:48:28,818
And I said, "Sam, you better
get rid of all this junk!"

805
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:31,343
Bobby, that place
was a fire trap.

806
00:48:31,517 --> 00:48:32,735
- Hmm.

807
00:48:36,043 --> 00:48:38,741
- Excuse me.
Are those the land deals?

808
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,613
- Yep.

809
00:48:40,787 --> 00:48:43,616
- What? You just went
and took 'em out of my office?

810
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,618
- Arliss, these aren't
your personal files.

811
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:47,533
They're municipal property.

812
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:50,797
Did you know that Cody and that
bunch up in San Francisco

813
00:48:50,971 --> 00:48:53,887
were trying to buy all the land
they can around here?

814
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:57,673
This isn't just about a mall,
I'll tell you that.

815
00:48:57,847 --> 00:48:59,849
- Well, I'm going to tell you
this.

816
00:49:00,024 --> 00:49:02,461
I don't know what it's about,

817
00:49:02,635 --> 00:49:05,377
but I do know that
I am mayor of this town

818
00:49:05,551 --> 00:49:06,944
and that I’m, uh,
going home for lunch.

819
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:13,733
- Don't look at me like that.
I didn't vote for him.

820
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,869

- How'd that happen?
- How about that, huh?

826
00:49:29,836 --> 00:49:32,752
She started eating
a few days ago just like that.

827
00:49:32,926 --> 00:49:35,885
- Well, that's a miracle.
- You're not kidding.

828
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,628

it's a sign.

831

- A blessing from above.

832
00:49:45,765 --> 00:49:48,072
- Yeah, maybe it is.

833
00:49:48,246 --> 00:49:51,553
We're still going to have to
keep a watch on her though.

834
00:49:55,731 --> 00:49:57,864
- Hey, dad! Dad.

835
00:49:58,038 --> 00:49:59,474
Look at Lucinda.
She's better.

836
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:01,694
- [Laughs]
Great.

it's a sign, a blessing.

- Well, isn't that something.

00:50:15,882 --> 00:50:17,666
- This was a great dinner, guys.
Thanks.

841
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:19,320
- You're welcome.

842
00:50:19,494 --> 00:50:23,803
- You ought to try some of
Bob's lasagna.

Well, it looks like you've got
everything under control.

that beauty sleep.

- I think it's working.

- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

00:50:34,161 --> 00:50:36,511
Hey, I got a couple of
pretty good bottles of wine

I brought from L.A.

850
00:50:38,426 --> 00:50:39,471
You want to take a look at 'em
and choose one?

851
00:50:39,645 --> 00:50:41,212
- Well, how about you choose,

852
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:42,691
and I'll just pretend
to know the difference.

853
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:45,912
- [Laughs]
All right.

854
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:48,045
- Let's go check on Lucinda.

855
00:51:07,368 --> 00:51:08,935
What do you think
they're talking about?

856
00:51:09,109 --> 00:51:12,112
- I don't know.

857
00:51:12,286 --> 00:51:14,375
What? Do you want to
go spy on 'em?

858
00:51:14,549 --> 00:51:15,942
Ok.

859
00:51:20,033 --> 00:51:22,688
- I appreciate you spending
so much time with Madison.

860
00:51:22,862 --> 00:51:24,211
- The pleasure is mine.

861
00:51:24,385 --> 00:51:26,996
You really have
an amazing daughter.

862
00:51:27,171 --> 00:51:30,130
She's got a connection
with that mother wolf

863
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:31,958
like I've never seen.

864
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:34,787
- Are you telling me
that she was

865
00:51:34,961 --> 00:51:37,616
with those wolves today?

866
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:40,836
- Yeah. She said that
you were all right with it.

867
00:51:41,010 --> 00:51:42,142
- I'm not all right with it.

868
00:51:42,316 --> 00:51:44,710
- Why?
- Well, I'm just not.

869
00:51:44,884 --> 00:51:46,886
- Well, I didn't know.

870
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,801
- I said I did not want
her getting too attached.

871
00:51:48,975 --> 00:51:50,977
- Or what?

872
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:52,805
I mean, what?
She'll get hurt?

873
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:55,590
- That's right.

874
00:51:55,764 --> 00:51:57,636
She's suffered enough loss
already.

875
00:51:57,810 --> 00:52:00,160

1050
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:08,768
- Make sure that envelope
gets mailed for me.

1051
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,291
- I will.

1052
01:02:14,426 --> 01:02:16,471
- Hey.
- Hey.

1053
01:02:16,645 --> 01:02:18,604
- The diner makes
the best lemonade around.

1054
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:21,476
My treat?
- Sure.

1055
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:24,784
- I was out of line
the other night,

1056
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,439
and I wanted to apologize.

1057
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:30,485
- I ought to be
apologizing.

1058
01:02:30,659 --> 01:02:32,183
- No, you're her dad,

1059
01:02:32,357 --> 01:02:33,837
and I should respect
your decision.

1060
01:02:34,011 --> 01:02:35,621
- I thought a lot
about what you said.

1061
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:36,970
I don't want to
break her spirit.

1062
01:02:38,798 --> 01:02:39,973
Why else do you think
I let her

1063
01:02:40,147 --> 01:02:41,496
keep going back
to your place?

1064
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,281
- You knew.
- Hey, I'm the sheriff.

1065
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,586
- Yeah.
[Laughs]

1066
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:48,547
Well, the wolves are ready
to be released.

1067
01:02:48,721 --> 01:02:51,680
Could I borrow Hank tomorrow?
- Sure.

1068
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,118
- Just so you know,
Madison's fine with it.

1069
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,423
- Good.

1070
01:02:57,425 --> 01:03:00,472
Well, I've got to get back
to work.

1071
01:03:00,646 --> 01:03:02,169
Thanks for the lemonade.

1072
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:06,739
- Hey.

1073
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:11,439
Everything is ok
between us?

1074
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:15,226
- I think so.
Yeah.

1075
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,271
- Ok. Good.

1076
01:03:17,445 --> 01:03:20,492
- Good.

1077

- Everything's going to be
all right.

1078
01:03:24,322 --> 01:03:28,108
You're a sign, Lucinda.
A blessing.

1079
01:03:28,282 --> 01:03:32,678
And the wolves are just...
they belong in the mountains.

1080
01:03:32,852 --> 01:03:35,812
They're wild.

1081
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:37,901
And they're just
going home tomorrow.

1082
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:39,598
Everything's going to be
all right,

1083
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:41,034
and I'm not going to cry.

1084
01:03:41,208 --> 01:03:44,603
[Horse snorts]
Yeah, I promised myself.

1085
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:54,308
- How are those wolf pups doing?

1086
01:03:54,482 --> 01:03:57,398
- You mad at me?

1087
01:03:57,572 --> 01:04:00,749
- [Sighs]
How could I be mad at you?

1088

I'm so glad we came here.

1090
01:04:09,628 --> 01:04:12,326
I am.

1091
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,329
And I'm ok about
the wolves leaving.

1092
01:04:15,503 --> 01:04:19,943
I just... I just
have to cry about it.

1093
01:04:20,117 --> 01:04:22,293
And that's ok, right?
- It's ok.

1094
01:04:22,467 --> 01:04:27,515
- [Sniffling]

1095
01:04:27,689 --> 01:04:28,647
Dad?

1096
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:30,779
When you... when you cry,

1097
01:04:30,954 --> 01:04:33,173
will you let me hold you
like this?

1098
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:35,959
I just...

1099
01:04:36,133 --> 01:04:38,439
I just think that if
you let me hold you

1100
01:04:38,613 --> 01:04:41,878
that it won't hurt so much.

1101

- [Sighs]

1102
01:04:48,536 --> 01:04:49,755
- Do you remember when
Gus carved that?

1103
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:52,236
- Hmm. Yep.

1104
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:56,631
After he was thrown by
that big old bay stallion.

1105
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:59,547
- [Sighs] Broke his hip,
got right back on.

1106

forget it either.

- [Laughs]
That's how legends are made.

1108
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:07,686
- You remember how many people
he threatened

1109
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:08,948
to hit over the head
with this thing?

1110
01:05:09,122 --> 01:05:11,908
- Oh, over 100.
- Yeah.

1111
01:05:12,082 --> 01:05:15,346
That's what legends
are made of.

He looks it, doesn't he?

1113
01:05:20,742 --> 01:05:23,615
Handsome devil.

1114
01:05:23,789 --> 01:05:25,965
- You know, Bob,

1115
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:31,797
taking on his legacy
is not a bad thing.

1116
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:37,846
- Maybe not.

1117
01:05:38,021 --> 01:05:39,848
- Hey, they're going to
have corn beef and cabbage.

1118
01:05:40,023 --> 01:05:42,634
$2.50, and it's good!
I'm going to see you there.

1119
01:05:42,808 --> 01:05:44,723
[Laughs]
- Morning, arliss.

1120
01:05:47,682 --> 01:05:49,162
- Morning.

1121
01:05:51,817 --> 01:05:53,384
- You know, this belongs
to your son-in-law.

1122
01:05:53,558 --> 01:05:54,689
- It does?

1123
01:05:54,863 --> 01:05:57,866
- Arson's a serious crime.

1124
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,738
- Oh, see, I don't know
anything about that.

1125
01:05:59,912 --> 01:06:00,782
- What about silver?

1126
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,741
- Silver?

1127
01:06:02,915 --> 01:06:06,049
- Dry drilling,
killing some horses.

1128
01:06:06,223 --> 01:06:08,573
- I don't know anything
about that.

1129
01:06:08,747 --> 01:06:09,530
- I wonder if Cody does.

1130
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:11,010
Where is he?

1131
01:06:11,184 --> 01:06:13,447

Bobby, I have no idea.

You know, arliss,
for a politician

1134
01:06:17,495 --> 01:06:18,713
you're not a very good liar.

1135
01:06:18,887 --> 01:06:20,715
- Well, he left town
yesterday.

1136
01:06:20,889 --> 01:06:22,152
- Well, that's all right.

1137
01:06:22,326 --> 01:06:23,718
I'll arrest him
when he gets back.

1138

Him and anybody else
who's involved.

- Yeah, arliss, what is it?
- You just shut up and listen.

1144

- What? What do you want?

1145
01:06:41,475 --> 01:06:43,521
- When you come back,
don't go into town.

1146
01:06:43,695 --> 01:06:44,957
- Ok, where then?

1147
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:46,698
- Meet me... meet me at the mine.
- Where?

1148

- The mine.

walk back down on my own

Pretty neat, huh?

is not a good idea.

give you a black eye.
