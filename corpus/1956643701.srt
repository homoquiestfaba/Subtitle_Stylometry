00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,454
[Missy]
We didn't choose this love...

3
00:00:21,454 --> 00:00:22,789
It chose us.

4
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:27,494
It spoke for us...

5
00:00:27,494 --> 00:00:29,629
and it guided our hand.

6
00:00:32,232 --> 00:00:35,201
We saw each other
for who we really are...

7
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:39,539
and nothing
can keep us apart.

8
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,477

[male #1]
Get down, get down, get down!

14
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,263
Let's go!

15
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,203
-Are you men or are you boys?
-Men!

16
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,437
Are you warriors?

17
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,372
-Or are you cowards?
-Warriors!

18
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:48,608
I want to see blood out
on that field tonight.

19
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,310
[all]
Yes, sir!

20
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:51,377
My boy is going to lead you

21
00:01:51,377 --> 00:01:52,645
to victory out there tonight.

22
00:01:52,645 --> 00:01:54,714
Are you ready, son?

23
00:01:54,714 --> 00:01:57,750
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir!

24
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,552
-Are you ready?
-Yes, sir.

25
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,454
Then get out there
and show me!

00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:03,223
[all cheering]

27
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:05,658
We'll smash the Red Bulls.
Yeah!

Let's go!

00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,639
[Duncan]
You let me down.
You let yourself down.

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,407
You let the whole
damn school down!

32
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:22,775
[Mac]
Ah! Please.

33
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:23,843
[Duncan]
You're too chicken-shit

34
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:25,145
running in yourself.

35
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,412
[Mac grunts]

00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,847
[door opens]

37
00:02:57,911 --> 00:02:59,379
Oh, my God!

38
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,185
I gotta play better.

39
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,953
Mac.

40
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,590
It's okay. I can take it.

41
00:03:12,292 --> 00:03:14,360
It would be worse
if he knew about us.

42
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,530
What if I had a way out?

43
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,970
No way.

44
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,207
[chuckles]
No way.

45
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,708
-You got in?
-Yeah.

46
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,977
[both laughing]

47
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:34,681
Really, it's, uh, just a routine
English program.

48
00:03:34,681 --> 00:03:38,351
-Six more months.
-Only six more months.

49
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,420
High school will be over.

50
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,821
Then we can be done
with this town

51
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,656
and everyone in it.

52
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,325
I got a surprise
for you too.

53
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,499
What is it?

54
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:57,503
[camera shutter clicks]

55
00:03:57,503 --> 00:03:58,771
[both chuckle]

56
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,348
It's so retro.
I love it.

57
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,916
I think it belonged
to my mom.

58
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,585
How do you know?

59
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,723
Sitting on top of this.

60
00:04:16,723 --> 00:04:18,625
[Missy]
She's beautiful.

61
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:21,461
[Mac]
This is the first picture
of her I'd ever seen.

62
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:22,695
I think it's why
he makes me sleep

63
00:04:22,695 --> 00:04:25,265
in the pool house.

64
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,267
He says it's to focus me
on football

65
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,669
but I think it's 'cause
I remind him of her.

66
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,808
She was an amazing woman.

67
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,612
I wouldn't know.

68
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:45,051
She loved you more than
her own life.

69
00:04:45,051 --> 00:04:46,819
And that's all
that matters.

70
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:51,824
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

71
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,562
[Missy chuckling]

72
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:57,897

74
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,068

Flash is bright.

[instrumental music]

76
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:31,464
[Missy]
Gran, you want some breakfast?

77
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:33,032
Oh, there you are, Sarah.

78
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,368
Grandma...

79
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,605
It's me, Missy.

80
00:05:39,605 --> 00:05:41,541
[sighs]
Did you move my lavender shawl?

81
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,347
Here. Gran.

82
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,781
-Grandma.
-Oh!

83
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,020
I have to go to school, okay?

84
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,621
Do not forget your bus pass
on the way

85
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:56,956
to your doctor's appointment,
right?

86
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,791
[chuckles]
Okay.

87
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,961
[Mac]
Twenty two rights,
Green two, River.

88
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:03,129
Twenty two. Left.

89
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,797
Draw the defenders away
from the box.

90
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,733
The lineman must apply
strong zone principles.

91
00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:08,968
Two left spread. QBS to make
a quick indecisive decision.

92
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:10,103
Could be as if he has...

93
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,871
Red 22, hut!

94
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:13,639
Hut!

95
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:17,810
[Duncan]
Get your ass up, boy.

96
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,417
[birds chirping]

97
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,463
[Duncan sighs]

98
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:48,007
LSU, USC, Georgia.

99
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:49,842
Gone.

100
00:06:49,842 --> 00:06:52,612
'Cause you're too afraid to gut
something out on your own.

101
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:55,915
We still have a shot
at a few of these.

102
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:58,584
OSU is looking for a backup.

103
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,653
Dad, maybe I don't wanna
play in college.

104
00:07:05,858 --> 00:07:07,627
You got somethin' better
to do, boy?

105
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:09,962
No, sir.

106
00:07:09,962 --> 00:07:12,432
[Duncan]
I saw you after the game.

107
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,768
Kissin' on that
squirrelly girl.

108
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,838
You think she cares
about your scholarship?

109
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,675
Little gig just wants
to be Prom Queen.

110
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,660
[sighs]

111
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,563
Hell, I don't know
how to get through to you.

112
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:46,566
This parenting thing
wasn't supposed to be my job.

113
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:48,100
Sometimes, I'm glad
she's not here

114
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,735
to see what her son
has become.

115
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,709
Do I need to step in here, son?

116
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:59,979
-No, sir.
-Do I need to step in here?

117
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,914
No, sir, I'm sorry, I...

118
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:03,816
I'm sorry,
she's a jersey chaser.

119
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:06,886
I'll get rid of her.

120
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,824
There's gonna be
a lot of skirts chasing you.

121
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:15,795
You respect the game...

122
00:08:15,795 --> 00:08:17,864
-Always.
-Yes, sir.

123
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:19,832
[car honks]

124
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:22,702
That's Troy.
I gotta go.

125
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,604
You're just gonna
leave your bowl?

126
00:08:28,274 --> 00:08:30,877
[instrumental music]

127
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,765
[car honks]

128
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,104
Hey, Mac.

129
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,040
Hey, Candy.

130
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,042
Still can't believe your pops
won't let you have a car.

131
00:09:36,042 --> 00:09:37,577
He owns the dealership.

132
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,011
He should be driving me
to school.

133
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,181
San Diego's coming
to Friday's game.

134
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:44,083
Throw me a touchdown pass,
we'll call it even, alright?

135
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,585
Yeah.

136
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,256
Hey, Mac.
You got a second, buddy?

137
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,161
Rough game on Friday.

138
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:57,296
Yeah.

139
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,299
[sighs]

140
00:10:00,299 --> 00:10:04,203
There's a method
to his madness, you know.

141
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,938
It's your dad
that got me into college.

142
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,275
Yeah? And how's your head doing?

143
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,113
[sighs]

144
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,615
-Sorry.
-No.

145
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,884
I mean, I... I get it.

146
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,888
I remember being so angry after
games I wanted to kill somebody.

147
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:27,660
But, everything has a way
of falling into place.

148
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,298
Do you know that
we're getting married?

149
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,170
That's really great, Duff.

150
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:39,805
What I'm trying
to say is that...

151
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:43,809
everything happens
for a reason so...

152
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:47,313
don't be too hard
on yourself, alright?

153
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:50,149
Yeah.

154
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,053
-I, uh, got to get to class.
-Yeah.

155
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,827
-Have a good day, buddy.
-Thanks.

156
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:06,399
[Missy]
I chose Jane Eyre
as my hero from literature.

157
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:10,036
Not, um...

158
00:11:11,871 --> 00:11:13,973
for the hardships
she endured

159
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:16,776
or because
Jane was an orphan

160
00:11:16,776 --> 00:11:19,345
whose family
abandoned her but...

161
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,946
because...

162
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,049
[sighs]

163
00:11:27,987 --> 00:11:31,290
But, b-because Jane created
her own identity

164
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,793
when women weren't allowed
to have one.

165
00:11:33,793 --> 00:11:35,161
She...

166
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:37,163
refused to be
chained down

167
00:11:37,163 --> 00:11:39,999
by the rules
pushed on her by others.

168
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,834
She took matters
into her own hands

169
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,369
and wrote her own future.

170
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:47,306
Hmm.

171
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:49,008
She made her own
moral code

172
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:50,910
that guided her to happiness

173
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:55,214
and... despite all the odds

174
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,849
even though the man
she fell for

175
00:11:56,849 --> 00:12:00,086
was above her station

176
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:02,254
she found her true love.

177
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,726
Like you'll ever know
what love feels like.

178
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,327
It's probably similar
to that feeling

179
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,496
you get when you're being passed
around by the football team.

180
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:11,797
-Girls.
-Nice comeback.

181
00:12:11,797 --> 00:12:12,832

I can handle it.

364
00:25:17,148 --> 00:25:21,152
Well, uh, guess I need to
head over to the house

365
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:23,522
tell young Mac
he's now an orphan.

366
00:25:24,623 --> 00:25:25,957
I'll do it, sheriff.

367
00:25:27,692 --> 00:25:28,927
You sure?

368
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:31,897
Yeah.

369
00:25:32,797 --> 00:25:34,199
Alright.

370
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:38,803
Bill, how much longer
are you gonna be here?

371
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,544
[both chuckle]

372
00:25:52,183 --> 00:25:53,985
Oh, crap.

373
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,154
You can do this.

374
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:02,961
[Mac]
Morning, Duff.

375
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,230
What's going on?

376
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,903
There was a, an incident
last night

377
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,672
involving your father.

378
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,740
Okay.

379
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,744
Mac, I'm sorry to
tell you this, but...

380
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:23,348
he was killed last night.

381
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:30,655
Oh, Mac. I'm so sorry.

382
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,896
We're gonna get through this.

383
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:40,732
I'm sorry, I-I don't think
we've met.

384
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,734
This my girlfriend, Duff.

385
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,836
[Duffy]
Oh, I...

386
00:26:44,836 --> 00:26:48,139
I didn't know you had one.
That's... that's good.

387
00:26:49,708 --> 00:26:51,242
Look, I want you to know that
you're more than welcome

388
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:52,877
to come and stay
with Alice and I.

389
00:26:52,877 --> 00:26:54,212
Want you to
think of us as family.

390
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:55,814
Okay.

391
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,984
Absolutely.

392
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:01,920
We'll get through this.

393
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,990
[instrumental music]

394
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,978
Hey when you called me
your girlfriend...

395
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,248
that's all
I ever wanted.

396
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,221
I can't take back
what happened.

397
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,091
Even if I could,
I wouldn't.

398
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:49,100
What happens next
is up to you.

399
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:55,040
Just know I did it
because I love you.

400
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,451
Wait.

401
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:16,061
I can't live without you.

402
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,398
I don't want to.

403
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:29,874
Come on.

404
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:35,480
[indistinct chatter]

405
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,054
[both chuckle]

406
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,392
This is all yours now.

407
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,128
No.

408
00:28:50,862 --> 00:28:52,230
It's ours.

409
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,832
[Missy chuckles]

410
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,836
Wait. Wait...

411
00:28:57,836 --> 00:28:58,970
What's wrong?

412
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,440
Marry me.

413
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,342
[laughs]
What?

414
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,412
-Marry me.
-What?

415
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:10,482
[Missy chuckles]

416
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,865
I can't get it
out of my head.

417
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:29,434
What, Duncan?

418
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:33,037
Just seein' him...

419
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:36,040
laying there.

420
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,446
It's bloody,
and it's cold.

421
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:45,850
I wish I didn't see him
like that.

422
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:52,157
He told me to call him dad.

423
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,559
He would.

424
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,299
How's Mac doing?

425
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,902
Boy bawled his eyes out.

426
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,039
But he's stronger
than he thinks.

427
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:16,414
Apparently, he's got
a new girlfriend.

428
00:30:17,081 --> 00:30:18,183
Missy.

429
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,984
Yeah.

430
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:22,420
How'd you know?

431
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,023
Some kids actually
do come to counseling.

432
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,493
-She takes counseling?
-Mm-hmm.

433
00:30:29,561 --> 00:30:30,962
What for?

434
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:32,530
Baby, you know,
I can't talk about that.

435
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:36,501
Yeah, it's just I've...

436
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,102
I've never seen
this girl before

437
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:39,204
and all of a sudden,
she's...

438
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,872
Honey. Honey.

439
00:30:40,872 --> 00:30:42,607
Just know she's...

440
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:44,509
really good
for Mac right now.

441
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:47,111
Yeah.

442
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,121
Bye, dad.

443
00:30:57,121 --> 00:31:00,191
[instrumental music]

444
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:22,580
Come on, Gran.

445
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,316
This is your home now too,
grandma.

446
00:31:36,661 --> 00:31:38,062
[Missy]
You okay?

447
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,170
I knew your dad, Duncan.

448
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:48,373
He gave me my first job,
and I just...

449
00:31:48,373 --> 00:31:49,641
See you, coach.

450
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,611
Dude.

451
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:56,581
-Mac, seriously?
-Yeah.

452
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,383
Hey, good luck.

453
00:31:58,383 --> 00:32:01,085
[Connelly]
Did you ever find out
if this plastic

454
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,353
belonged to the car?

455
00:32:02,353 --> 00:32:04,522
No. It doesn't.

456
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:07,025
It doesn't belong to any other
vehicle in the lot either.

457
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:08,660
I think it maybe it could
belong to one of our killers.

458
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:11,362
I'm sending it all
to Tulsa Forensics now.

459
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:13,598
Mrs. Pearson is going
to rehab.

460
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:14,632
It's crazy...

461
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,034
Missy.

462
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:17,468
Over here.

463
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:19,671
Wait, Mac, I know you're
going through some stuff but--

464
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,306
Candice, scoot over.

465
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,441
You heard him?

466
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,111
-Hi, Missy.
-Hey...

467
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,324
Excuse me, deputy.

468
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:48,266
Missy. I wasn't expecting you.

469
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:52,136
Mm, Mac's having a really
hard time with all this

470
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:55,573
and he asked if I could come
instead. I hope that's okay.

471
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,475
This is usually
done with family.

472
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,413
I guess we can make
an exception this time.

473
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,751
These are the items that were
deemed non-crucial to the case.

474
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:08,486
Um...

475
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:11,689
I'm sure Mac would like to
have them back.

476
00:33:12,457 --> 00:33:13,691
Definitely.

477
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,696
Uh, his wallet's in here.

478
00:33:18,696 --> 00:33:21,099
Cash, credit cards.

479
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,734
Weren't very good thieves,
were they?

480
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,170
What do you mean?

481
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,772
They just left the money.

482
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,011
How well did you know Duncan?

483
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:40,385
T-though we did get pretty close
there right at the end.

484
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,487
Really? I...

485
00:33:42,487 --> 00:33:45,456
I just don't ever
remember him

486
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:47,525
saying anything about
Mac having a girlfriend.

487
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,395
[chuckles]
Yeah.

488
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:52,397
Well, Duncan didn't really
talk about much

489
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:54,198
other than football now,
did he?

490
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:58,136
Not really sure if he cared
about anything else.

491
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:03,775
Thank you, deputy.
I'll be sure Mac gets these.

492
00:34:07,645 --> 00:34:09,714
[instrumental music]

493
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:16,721
Come on.

494
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,427
Same make, same model,
same everything.

495
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,266
[chuckles]

496
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:34,405
-I love you.
-Love you too.

497
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,840
[Missy chuckles]

498
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:45,183
I got one more surprise
for you.

499
00:34:57,695 --> 00:34:59,297
[Mac]
Are you sure?

500
00:35:22,253 --> 00:35:23,454
Wait, stop, stop.

501
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:24,856
I would die for you.

502
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,624
Stop. Stop, stop.

503
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,726
-I would kill for you.
-Stop. Get off, get off!

504
00:35:37,168 --> 00:35:39,137
What? Did I
do something wrong?

505
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,872
No, it's not you,
it's just...

506
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,346
[exhales forcefully]

507
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,248
[doorbell dinging]

508
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:51,349
-H-hi.
-Hi.

509
00:35:51,349 --> 00:35:52,583
Come on in.

510
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,851
I brought you
a little something.

511
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:56,254
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, thank you so much.

512
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:57,855
I figured we could all spend
some time together.

513
00:35:57,855 --> 00:36:00,424
Of course.

514
00:36:00,424 --> 00:36:03,194
So, uh, no more pool house, huh?

515
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,495
[Mac]
No, I felt kinda weird
in there

516
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:06,197
big empty place
just sitting here.

517
00:36:06,197 --> 00:36:08,432
Figured it'd be hard
you bein' here all alone.

518
00:36:08,432 --> 00:36:10,835
No, I'm not alone. Missy's
really helped me through it all.

519
00:36:11,936 --> 00:36:15,173
Oh, and this is Grandma Sherrie.

520
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,208
-Hi.
-Wow.

521
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:19,443
-One big happy family.
-Really great, Mac.

522
00:36:19,443 --> 00:36:21,779
You know, you need all the
support you can get right now.

523
00:36:21,779 --> 00:36:23,614
Thank you, Alice.

524
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:25,850
You have no idea
how good it is to see you.

525
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,186
Hey, guys.

526
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:29,854
Come on, man.

527
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,489
-You okay?
-Yeah.

528
00:36:31,489 --> 00:36:34,225
Oh, sorry.
It's just a new present here.

529
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:36,794
-Let's eat.
-Yeah. Come on in, guys.

530
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:41,666
[Duffy]
So photography, huh?

531
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:43,534
I don't know,
it's something new.

532
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,537
New is good.

533
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,406
[dramatic music]

534
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,413
-Well...
-That bad, huh?

535
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,516
Flashin' lights got a

536
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,818
a way of messing with my head.

537
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,486
You got to admit, it was
pretty funny though, right?

538
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,690
[chuckles]
Yeah.

539
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,824
You know what, you keep it.

540
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:12,964
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

541
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,400
[Duffy]
I'll catch the guys
that did this.

542
00:37:20,271 --> 00:37:21,572
[Alice]
I know what you did, Missy.

543
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,740
[dramatic music]

544
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,279
I'm proud of you.

545
00:37:28,279 --> 00:37:30,014
Staying here instead of leaving
for Stanford

546
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:32,717
after what happened
and the way you've helped Mac.

547
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:34,352
Mac would have done
the same for me.

548
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:40,591
I know that Mac and Duncan
had a very strained relationship

549
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,694
but still, it's incredibly hard
to lose a parent.

550
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:45,363
[plate shatters]

551
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:48,766
I want you
to know that

552
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,368
we're doing everything
in our power

553
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,469
to catch the guys
that did this.

554
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:55,640
[Mac]
I just wanna forget about it.

555
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,879
I just wanna make sure
that you're not being confused

556
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,015
by any bad influences.

557
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,817
What bad influences?

558
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:09,287
With your dad gone, there's
gonna be a lot of people around

559
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,554
trying to take
advantage of you.

560
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:11,789
Well, Missy isn't one of them.

561
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,526
I'm not accusing anyone.

562
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,798
Come on, let's go inside.

563
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,337
How do you do that?

564
00:38:28,406 --> 00:38:29,740
[Mac]
What're you talking about?

565
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,877
How you just
turn it off like that?

566
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,813
Just got to keep moving.

567
00:38:37,915 --> 00:38:39,917
-Thanks again for dinner.
-Oh, of course, sweetheart.

568
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:41,752
Okay. I'll see at school
tomorrow, okay?

569
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,421
-Okay.
-Alright, have a good night.

570
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:45,323
-If you need anything.
-Yeah, of course.

571
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,857
-Bye. Drive safe.
-Bye, guys.

572
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,660
They're so great together.

573
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,597
He doesn't like me.

574
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:57,635
Duncan's body
isn't even cold yet.

575
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,438
-Of course he does.
-Really?

576
00:39:00,438 --> 00:39:02,640
What were you two
talking about outside?

577
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,943
Hey, what's wrong with you?

578
00:39:05,943 --> 00:39:07,611
He just needs some time
to get to know you.

579
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:10,614
It's just, uh...

580
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,852
Nothin'.
I'm just tired.

581
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:17,688
He could be dangerous.

582
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:20,925
Remember that.

583
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:25,730
There's only us.

584
00:39:27,998 --> 00:39:31,068
[upbeat music]

585
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:57,728
[Candice]
Hey, Missy, I was
wondering if maybe

586
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,029
you'd like to go
to lunch with me today?

587
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,898
Me and the girls
are going off campus.

588
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,768
Uh, yeah, that,
that would be nice.

589
00:40:03,768 --> 00:40:05,069
Good, because we need
someone to help...

590
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:06,604
Mac, Can I talk to you
for a second?

591
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:07,671
Yeah.

592
00:40:07,671 --> 00:40:09,073
You hear we got
murdered Friday?

593
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,674
Yeah, sorry, man.

594
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,011
Dude, I'm not Duffy
or Coach Clyde. I get it.

595
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:15,913
Your pops could be
kind of a dick.

596
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,516
-It's not like that.
-Yeah, right?

597
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:20,584
I can see daddy's love
all over you, man.

598
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,721
-Troy, I quit... for good.
-Yeah.

599
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:26,724
But the thing is all those
scouts were coming to see you.

600
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:29,160
I need those scouts
at the games

601
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,530
or I ain't going
to college.

602
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,031
Well, you better start
studying then.

603
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,068
Mac, what the hell
happened to you?

604
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:39,603
[bell ringing]

605
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:47,445
[instrumental music]

606
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:56,821
On his way to
the theater of Pompeii

607
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,923
Julius Caesar boasts

608
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:01,725
"The ides of March have come

609
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:04,462
yet still I stand."

610
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,797
To which the soothsayer replies

611
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,166
"Yes, Caesar

612
00:41:09,166 --> 00:41:13,137
but the ides
have not yet gone."

613
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:18,476
Julius Caesar, betrayed and
murdered by his closest friends.

614
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:22,580
So, what is Shakespeare
trying to tell us?

615
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,648
Your bros don't always
have your back.

616
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,917
[chuckles]
In a sense.

617
00:41:26,917 --> 00:41:28,552
What else?

618
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,155
Mac!

619
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,159
Mac!

620
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,095
Mac!

621
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:40,030
Dammit son, answer the man.

622
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:42,099
[breathing heavily]

623
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:50,241
Alas! Not everyone
hath the stomach...

624
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:53,544
for Shakespeare.

625
00:41:55,946 --> 00:41:59,016
[instrumental music]

626
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,900
[dramatic music]

627
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,070
[music continues]

628
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,921
Whoa!

629
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,623
Oh, my God.
Sorry.

630
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,095
[sniffling]

631
00:43:24,635 --> 00:43:25,836
You okay?

632
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,305
I don't know.

633
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:31,942
I guess...

634
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,384
I guess I'm just not used to
all this attention.

635
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,120
The whole school
watches Mac like...

636
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:48,959
like the sun
rises and sets with him.

637
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:52,396
This place is pretty sad,
isn't it?

638
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,900
Just remember, the boys might
walk all high and mighty

639
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,104
during the day, but they always
want to cuddle at night.

640
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:03,173
So, really, we're the ones
with all the power.

641
00:44:05,376 --> 00:44:06,744
Touch-up?

642
00:44:06,744 --> 00:44:08,379
[retching]

643
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:10,381
[Mac groaning]

644
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,732
[sobbing]

645
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:53,290
[Hecate]
We're seeing a lot of damage
from multiple concussions.

646
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,394
Some were diagnosed earlier, and
others we're discovering now.

647
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:00,330
I'm so sorry, Duffy.

648
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,167
You're showing signs
of atrophy, not improvement.

649
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:04,401
It's my recommendation
that you

650
00:45:04,401 --> 00:45:06,437
have a drastic
lifestyle change.

651
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,138
Take some time off from work.

652
00:45:08,138 --> 00:45:10,708
Get some rest.

653
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:12,076
Do you understand
what I am saying?

654
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,080
This is not going to go away.

655
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,918
[Sherrie]
You're gonna be so good.

656
00:45:20,918 --> 00:45:23,053
[talking indistinctly]

657
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,389
Hey, babe.

658
00:45:33,363 --> 00:45:35,766
Hey, what's wrong?

659
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:36,967
Nothing. Nothing.

660
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,001
-Hey.
-I'm fine.

661
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:39,236
Hey!

662
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,340
I see you, Mac.

663
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,075
And we may have to fake it
for the town

664
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,910
but you don't
have to hide from me.

665
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,248
I saw him.

666
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,485
My dad.

667
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:56,920
It's okay.

668
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,455
The blood, it's not washing off.

669
00:46:00,491 --> 00:46:03,293
My neck, it's like it's on fire.

670
00:46:03,293 --> 00:46:07,030
Something's crawling around
in my mind like a damn scorpion.

671
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,532
I can't get him out.

672
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:18,942
[instrumental music]

673
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,029
[Missy]
Everything's
gonna be okay, baby.

674
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,035
See, isn't that better?

675
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:47,871
This isn't as easy for me.

676
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,241
I don't think
I can keep doing it.

677
00:46:51,909 --> 00:46:53,310
Yes, you can.

678
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,582
No. No.

679
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,986
I'm not strong like you.

680
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:06,857
Are you kidding me?

681
00:47:06,857 --> 00:47:10,828
You just have a different
kind of strength.

682
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,897
[music continues]

683
00:47:34,384 --> 00:47:37,054
[Mac]
What are you doing?
I can't do this right now.

684
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:38,555
I'll take care of everything.

685
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:02,212
[instrumental music]

686
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:08,518
Hey.

687
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,555
What do you think?
Time to turn in?

688
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:14,057
I'll be up in a bit.

689
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,127
You need to listen
to your doctor.

690
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:20,330
Rest, relax.

691
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:25,569
Gotta move on, babe.

692
00:48:28,438 --> 00:48:30,407
Okay. I'll go to bed.

693
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:37,414
You know, you sound like them.

694
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,083
-What?
-Mac and his new girlfriend.

695
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:44,121
His dad gets murdered and
they act like they don't care

696
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,422
and now you too.

697
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:47,257
Of course they do, and I do too.

698
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,293
Yeah, I'm sure Missy's
over there bawling her eyes out

699
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,561
in that big-ass mansion.

700
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,031
-Gold-digging whore.
-Hey.

701
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,100
You have no idea what that
little girl has been through.

702
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,603
That's right.
Of course you two are close.

703
00:49:01,238 --> 00:49:03,373
It figures, with two girls
from the wrong side of the track

704
00:49:03,373 --> 00:49:04,641
to get chummy doesn't it?

705
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:06,109
Okay.

706
00:49:07,144 --> 00:49:08,512
Damn it!

707
00:49:09,546 --> 00:49:10,647
[sighs]

708
00:49:25,329 --> 00:49:29,066
Seventies is just so played out.
I'm sick of bell bottoms.

709
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,234
Classic always works,
renaissance.

710
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,337
Oh, my God. A corset
with these babies.

711
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,172
You might as well
skip the Sadie Hawkins Dance

712
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:37,007
and come straight
to my after-party.

713
00:49:37,007 --> 00:49:38,709
It's gonna be savage.

714
00:49:38,709 --> 00:49:40,277
Uh, yeah.

715
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,712
Yeah, okay, we're in.

716
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:43,747
Dress shopping
this weekend, Missy?

717
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:45,248
Wouldn't miss it.

718
00:49:46,016 --> 00:49:47,684
Guys, look.

719
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:49,252
[Duffy]
Excuse me.

720
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:50,687
[Troy]
What's Duffy doing here?

721
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:00,597
I need to see that photo
from my engagement party.

722
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,566
I wanna confirm that Duncan
was wearing his belt

723
00:50:02,566 --> 00:50:04,034
the night he was killed.

724
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:05,502
It wasn't found
at the crime scene.

725
00:50:06,536 --> 00:50:08,338
[Clyde]
Yeah, sure.

726
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,443
There's your belt right there.

727
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,313
Text this to me right now.
Good work, coach.

728
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:18,181
[Clyde]
Hey, Duff.
Hey, what's going on?

729
00:50:22,285 --> 00:50:24,054
[Alice]
Come on, Missy.

730
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:27,791
I can't help you if I don't
know what's going on.

731
00:50:29,626 --> 00:50:31,261
Missy, please let me in.

732
00:50:37,067 --> 00:50:39,302
"May you never appeal
to heaven...

733
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:48,145
"in prayers so hopeless
and so agonized...

734
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:50,647
"as in that hour
left my lips.

735
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,452
"For never may you...

736
00:50:57,387 --> 00:50:59,056
"like me...

737
00:51:02,325 --> 00:51:06,229
dread to be an instrument
to what you wholly love."

738
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,468
I am an instrument of evil.

739
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,771
That's not true.

740
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:18,241
Mac's father
was horrible to him.

741
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:23,280
And I wanted him dead.

742
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:28,285
I wanted him dead
so we could be together.

743
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,459
And now he is.

744
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:37,527
No. No.

745
00:51:37,527 --> 00:51:41,731
Missy, what happened
to Duncan is truly evil

746
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:43,300
but it wasn't you.

747
00:51:44,701 --> 00:51:47,804
These feelings...

748
00:51:47,804 --> 00:51:52,242
these desires
to protect Mac...

749
00:51:52,242 --> 00:51:56,546
If love is not the one thing
worth fighting for

750
00:51:56,546 --> 00:51:58,181
then what is?

751
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:03,120
[thunder rumbling]

752
00:52:06,656 --> 00:52:09,726
[intense music]

753
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:28,178
[Candice]
Highlanders!

754
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,780
♪ Fair is foul
and foul is fair ♪

755
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:33,750
♪ Troy is here
you best beware ♪

756
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:38,421
Whoo! Missy! Hey!

757
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:40,757
So, what do you think
of the new routine?

758
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,893
-Loved it.
-Thank you.

759
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,162
Coach Clyde wants to see you
in his office.

760
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:48,865
Oh, God. It's probably
'cause of my absences.

761
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:52,936
It's probably because
he's totally obsessed with you.

762
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,305
Well, I better
give the all-purpose show

763
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:57,474
if I mean to get out
of detention.

764
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,409
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck.

765
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:08,785
Coach Clyde,
you wanted to see me?

766
00:53:08,785 --> 00:53:13,390
Um, hello! I'm here.

767
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,411
Duff. Great call
on the belt, son.

768
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:35,812
Damn cheerleader called it in.

769
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:39,382
Found Duncan's belt
tucked away in Clyde's office.

770
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,651
No. No, this can't be right.
It--

771
00:53:41,651 --> 00:53:44,754
Now, just enjoy it, son. Your
first homicide and you nail it.

772
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:47,390
You're a superstar again.

773
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,594
Sheriff, I'm telling you. I have
known this man for eight years.

774
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:51,895
That's a good man
that you have in there

775
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,496
and I'm not telling you,
he did not do it.

776
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:54,831
This ain't our guy.

777
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,833
Duffy, you're gonna learn
in time

778
00:53:56,833 --> 00:53:57,968
that people are not always

779
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,703
how they appear on the surface.

780
00:53:59,703 --> 00:54:00,937
Now, first thing tomorrow

781
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:02,339
I want you down
at that high school.

782
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:04,241
You go interview
the other coaches

783
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:06,610
any teachers
he's close with, the players.

784
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:10,280
Hell, anybody that might
give us something on Clyde.

785
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:14,618
This ain't our guy... but I'll
find you the person that is.

786
00:54:17,621 --> 00:54:18,989
[bell ringing]

787
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,590
You know, I can't wait
for this weekend.

788
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,899
What are you doing?

789
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:31,701
We had to give Duffy something.

790
00:54:31,701 --> 00:54:33,970
Clyde didn't do anything.

791
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,705
I don't like it anymore than you

792
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:37,374
but if it's between him or us

793
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:38,942
I'd chose us, wouldn't you?

794
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:44,347
[Mac]
Yeah.

795
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,951
Then, what's the problem?

796
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,623
You just seem
awful comfortable about it.

797
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,892
You set up a man for murder
and still find time

798
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:57,060
to go dress shopping.

799
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:03,333
Ever since that night, you
haven't looked at me the same.

800
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,337
You're scared of me.

801
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:11,474
No.

802
00:55:21,618 --> 00:55:22,886
Not of you...

803
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:26,056
of us.

804
00:55:29,759 --> 00:55:32,529
I'm scared of what
this is turning us into.

805
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:42,739
I have seen things too, Mac.

806
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:47,410
Things that only belong
in nightmares.

807
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,949
Why didn't you tell me?

808
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,453
I thought I was losing my mind.

809
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,689
I had to be strong.

810
00:56:01,725 --> 00:56:05,061
I would live a thousand
nightmares to be with you.

811
00:56:06,796 --> 00:56:09,466
But I need you to be strong too

812
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:13,036
'cause I... I can't do it
all on my own.

813
00:56:18,842 --> 00:56:20,043
Aah. Yippie-ki-yay, boys.

814
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,581
Mac, heads up.

815
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,150
Hey, Mac, will you teach me
how to throw a spiral?

816
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:31,821
Yeah. You, uh, be real gentle
to start with.

817
00:56:31,821 --> 00:56:33,490
-Not too gently.
-Yeah.

818
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:36,760
You grip it kinda like that.

819
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:42,432
Just...
You grip right about...

820
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:49,038
Yo, let's bounce. I wanna stop
for a burger on the way home.

821
00:56:49,038 --> 00:56:50,974
Yeah, you guys go on ahead.

822
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:53,910
Wait, Mac, are you leaving me?

823
00:56:56,112 --> 00:56:58,748
Uh, no. I'm just
not feeling too hot.

824
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:00,683
I'm gonna walk this off
before I get home.

825
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:01,985
You know how my dad is.

826
00:57:06,689 --> 00:57:08,057
Hey! It's, uh...

827
00:57:11,027 --> 00:57:12,695
Missy, right?

828
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,436
Hey, are we both
in drama with Mr. Perez?

829
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:29,546
You know, I can tell
what time it is in class

830
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:31,014
without looking at the clock.

831
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,450
Do you wanna know how?

832
00:57:35,718 --> 00:57:40,056
Well, you see,
class faces west.

833
00:57:40,056 --> 00:57:41,891
When I starting getting glare
off his bald spot

834
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:43,960
that's how I know
it's almost over.

835
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,229
[chuckles]

836
00:57:46,229 --> 00:57:49,165
Yeah, his head's
like the world's last sundial.

837
00:57:51,734 --> 00:57:53,670
[sobbing]

838
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,847
Can you, um...

839
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:05,248
Can you turn around now?

840
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:11,988
I never thought my jokes
were bad enough to make someone

841
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,990
to make someone
pretty as you cry.

842
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:16,593
[laughing]

843
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:18,828
-What's wrong?
-I'm all alone.

844
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,764
[instrumental music]

845
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,611
[Missy]
So really, the biggest
takeaway from this novel

846
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:36,946
is that both love
and evil are relative.

847
00:58:36,946 --> 00:58:38,681
We can't have one
without the other.

848
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,783
And where there is love,
there will also be...

849
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:42,719
[farts]

850
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,621
That's quite enough,
Mr. Wayleigh.

851
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:47,624
I'm sorry, Missy,
please continue.

852
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:52,795
[Missy]
Ah, yeah. Uh...

853
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,864
Like I said, love is evil.

854
00:58:57,867 --> 00:58:59,302
Wh... Uh...

855
00:58:59,302 --> 00:59:01,671
Where there is love,
there will also be--

856
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,173
-Boring!
-Hey!

857
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:05,642
Would you like a trip
to the principal's...

858
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,878
Hey, Mac! Mac, get off of him!

859
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:10,713
Stop! Mac, get off of him!

860
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:14,284
Hey! Break it up!
Stop it! Get off...

861
00:59:14,284 --> 00:59:16,719
What is wrong with you?

862
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,021
Go to the principal's office
right now.

863
00:59:18,021 --> 00:59:19,889
-Troy started it.
-It doesn't matter.

864
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,190
You can't just attack someone

865
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,825
because you don't like
what they said.

866
00:59:22,825 --> 00:59:24,761
If you had more control
over your classroom--

867
00:59:24,761 --> 00:59:26,696
-Missy!
-It wouldn't have happened.

868
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:28,831
Wait outside for me, please.

869
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,767
Whatever. Let's go, Mac.

870
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,071
Are you alright?

871
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:36,773
Coach Clyde's been here
eight years now.

872
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:40,243
How well do you know him?

873
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,012
The coaches keep to themselves.

874
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:46,950
High school clerks
go way beyond the students.

875
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:50,687
Of course, Clyde respected me

876
00:59:50,687 --> 00:59:52,789
as the head
of the drama department.

877
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:56,326
Yeah. Yeah.

878
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,027
I'm sure he does.

879
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,196
Well, he was, like,
always so obsessed

880
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,031
with us cheerleaders, you know.

881
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:03,733
Mm-hmm.

882
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,802
So, what was it like
when you went to school here?

883
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,837
I mean, you played ball too,
right?

884
01:00:07,837 --> 01:00:09,072
Yeah.

885
01:00:09,072 --> 01:00:11,608
-That was a long time ago.
-Oh.

886
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,343
[Troy grunting]

887
01:00:15,878 --> 01:00:17,180
Can you wrap that up?

888
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:21,351
[Troy]
Coach Clyde didn't do it.

889
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,020
What makes you say that?

890
01:00:25,888 --> 01:00:27,924
You cops need motive, right?

891
01:00:27,924 --> 01:00:29,359
Coach Clyde
was the complete opposite.

892
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,162
He loved Coach Duncan.
He frickin' worshipped the dude.

893
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:35,932
If anybody needed a reason
to kill Duncan

894
01:00:35,932 --> 01:00:37,333
it's his own kid.

895
01:00:37,333 --> 01:00:40,136
-You're talking about Mac.
-Yeah.

896
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:43,339
I mean, he wasn't exactly
the kid Duncan always wanted

897
01:00:43,339 --> 01:00:45,808
and he reminded Mac
of that almost every day.

898
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:47,010
You should have seen
Mac's neck the day

899
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:49,679
after the king showed up dead.

900
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,347
Looked like coach
took a belt to it.

901
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:55,818
A belt, huh?

902
01:00:57,153 --> 01:00:59,322
This is your best friend
you're accusing.

903
01:01:01,257 --> 01:01:03,292
Best friend?

904
01:01:03,292 --> 01:01:05,928
You mean the golden boy
and his bitch girlfriend?

905
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:07,397
He does whatever
she tells him to do.

906
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:09,699
Taking instructions,
following orders.

907
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:12,201
He used to be a leader.
He used to run this place.

908
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,904
Now... I don't even recognize
the dude when I see him.

909
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:15,938
My best friend?

910
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,907
[indistinct chatter]

911
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:21,044
Missed you in our session today.

912
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,845
Yeah, I don't need
counseling anymore.

913
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:26,849
It doesn't exactly work that
way. And after what happened--

914
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,152
Missy, you coming or what?

915
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,787
I got to run.
I'll make it next time.

916
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:33,089
Missy...

917
01:01:41,297 --> 01:01:42,799
Hey, Mac.

918
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,269
Mac, hold up a minute,
will you, buddy?

919
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,405
Look, if you're here
to ask me about Clyde

920
01:01:49,405 --> 01:01:50,807
I don't know anything.

921
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,209
No. I'm here to ask about you.

922
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:55,712
I want to know how you're doing.

923
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:57,346
I'm doing alright.

924
01:01:57,346 --> 01:01:59,916
I'm actually supposed to
go meet Missy right now, so...

925
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,451
How well do you
even know this girl, huh?

926
01:02:05,221 --> 01:02:07,724
Clyde is going down for murder.

927
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:10,193
You know that, right?

928
01:02:10,193 --> 01:02:12,895
And they're gonna give him
the death penalty unless

929
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,064
maybe you know something
that can change that.

930
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:18,034
You're the cop.
You arrest him. I trust you.

931
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,802
Mac. Let me see something.

932
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:23,306
Do not touch me.

933
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:24,340
I know you and Duncan

934
01:02:24,340 --> 01:02:26,275
fought the night that he died.

935
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,111
You need to tell me
what happened.

936
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:29,846
You call beating
the shit out of me "fighting"

937
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,214
then yeah, we fought that night.

938
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:32,915
Look, if you just
tell me the truth

939
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,117
we can work this out together.

940
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,319
I can help you.

941
01:02:36,319 --> 01:02:37,754
I can't protect you
if you don't--

942
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,021
Then again, he beat me
the week before too

943
01:02:39,021 --> 01:02:40,990
so it's hard to know
which night you mean.

944
01:02:42,492 --> 01:02:45,094
It's funny.

945
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,763
I don't remember
you asking about the truth

946
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:50,133
after any one of these fights
before he died.

947
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,934
You know what he was.

948
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:55,505
Who are you?

949
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,041
My dad wanted me to be a man.

950
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,376
He finally got it.

951
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,311
This isn't just gonna go away.

952
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,046
If you think you could
go around playin' house

953
01:03:04,046 --> 01:03:05,281
after something
like this happens

954
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,549
you got another thing coming.

955
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:09,118
I'm coming, for you
and your girlfriend.

956
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:10,520
You hear me?

957
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:13,956
You come after my house...

958
01:03:15,091 --> 01:03:16,793
I burn yours
to the ground.

959
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,862
[dramatic music]

960
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,066
[engine revving]

961
01:03:47,256 --> 01:03:50,193
[woman on phone]
We found micro traces
of blood on that belt.

962
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,929
There's a genetic similarity
to the victim.

963
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:55,331
Probably a close relative.

964
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:59,268
[knocking on door]

965
01:03:59,268 --> 01:04:00,303
-Mac, open the door.
-Gran.

966
01:04:00,303 --> 01:04:01,871
This is really important.

967
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:05,074
Anything y'all need,
I'm here for ya.

968
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:09,111
[knocking on door]

969
01:04:09,111 --> 01:04:10,313
Mac, open the door.

970
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:16,018
Let them in.

971
01:04:23,125 --> 01:04:24,627
Tell me about the fight
between you and your dad

972
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:26,229
the night that he died.

973
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,563
I told you everything at school.

974
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,131
How did the fight start?

975
01:04:29,131 --> 01:04:30,867
What were you two
fighting about?

976
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:38,307
I couldn't take the pressure
of football anymore.

977
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,544
I told him I wanted to quit.

978
01:04:42,645 --> 01:04:44,614
Then what happened next?

979
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:47,116
[sobbing]

980
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:50,052
Look, I love my dad.

981
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,153
I didn't want the whole town

982
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:52,555
to think bad about him.

983
01:04:56,192 --> 01:04:58,527
You sit still.

984
01:04:58,527 --> 01:05:00,563
Look, just because
that boy's blood

985
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:03,499
was on a belt, that don't mean
he killed his dad.

986
01:05:03,499 --> 01:05:05,401
And just because we found
a belt in Clyde's office

987
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:07,503
doesn't mean
he killed him either.

988
01:05:07,503 --> 01:05:09,639
By finding blood
on that belt at least gives us

989
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,942
probable cause
to question him, doesn't it?

990
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:15,611
Are you telling me
that that's the only night

991
01:05:15,611 --> 01:05:17,380
your dad ever put hands on you?

992
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,448
He was a good dad.

993
01:05:19,448 --> 01:05:22,251
Mac, stop lying to me.

994
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,420
You know there are plenty
of people who can corroborate

995
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,089
that your father was rough
on you plenty of times.

996
01:05:28,357 --> 01:05:30,293
Well, they're cowards then.

997
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,928
If someone thought my dad
was hurting me

998
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,696
they should have
reported it earlier.

999
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:36,032
I mean, it's pretty convenient
that someone would say

1000
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:38,334
these things after he's dead,
right?

1001
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,672
I see you put in your transfers
for early graduation.

1002
01:05:45,141 --> 01:05:48,444
Stanford, huh?
You must be pretty damn smart.

1003
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:52,548
Just honest hard work
and I'm an avid reader.

1004
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:54,383
You put down those transcripts

1005
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,152
the same day Duncan
was murdered.

1006
01:05:56,152 --> 01:05:59,221
That afternoon actually.

1007
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:01,157
The day that you decide
to leave high school

1008
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,392
the only person
keeping you two apart

1009
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:06,329
your secret boyfriend's dad

1010
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:08,331
just somehow turns up murdered?

1011
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,535
It's pretty convenient,
don't you think?

1012
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:16,505
If I tell you something...

1013
01:06:18,074 --> 01:06:19,642
will you promise
not to tell Mac?

1014
01:06:19,642 --> 01:06:22,011
-Absolutely.
-And you leave him out of it?

1015
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,479
You have my word.

1016
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:28,651
Mac came to my house
to say goodbye that night.

1017
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,588
He had bruises all over him.

1018
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:38,127
I've never been so mad
in my whole life.

1019
01:06:38,127 --> 01:06:40,730
So I decided right then.

1020
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:43,065
Mac needed my help.

1021
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,106
I couldn't leave him like that.

1022
01:06:50,106 --> 01:06:53,009
So...

1023
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,745
I decided to stay.

1024
01:06:55,745 --> 01:06:58,581
Mac cried in my arms
the entire night.

1025
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,418
I never let him out of my sight.

1026
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,355
I know it's terrible to say...

1027
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:12,361
but I'm not sad about Duncan.

1028
01:07:15,798 --> 01:07:18,234
I swore I'd never tell anyone.

1029
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:24,640
But Duncan had been hurting Mac
for years.

1030
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:29,378
To be honest, I'm surprised
you never knew, deputy.

1031
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:33,549
I mean, you were so close
with their family.

1032
01:07:34,817 --> 01:07:37,420
But I suppose it's for the best.

1033
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,690
Because if you had known
about the domestic violence

1034
01:07:41,690 --> 01:07:44,326
and did nothing...

1035
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:47,396
I guess that would make you

1036
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:50,232
an accessory
after the fact, right?

1037
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:55,671
Can anyone prove Mac
was there with you that night?

1038
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,675
Yes.

1039
01:07:59,675 --> 01:08:04,213
That poor child
seemed awfully hurt.

1040
01:08:04,213 --> 01:08:07,483
I wouldn't normally
let a boy spend the night.

1041
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:09,685
It's not proper.

1042
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:11,620
I...

1043
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:15,825
made him some
of my banana nut bread...

1044
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,461
my specialty.

1045
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,429
I'll bake some for the station.

1046
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,731
-Excuse me.
-I saw boxes of those old...

1047
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:24,366
stale donuts.

1048
01:08:26,368 --> 01:08:29,105
It was awfully nice of Mac

1049
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,706
to let your grandma stay
with the two of you

1050
01:08:30,706 --> 01:08:31,774
in that two-story mansion.

1051
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:35,211
Yes. It is.

1052
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,379
He is very kind.

1053
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:39,248
I think that's why
I love him so much.

1054
01:08:39,248 --> 01:08:41,550
You have been pulling his
strings all along, haven't you?

1055
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,818
Ever since the beginning.

1056
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:48,824
I would never make Mac
do anything he didn't want to.

1057
01:08:48,824 --> 01:08:51,627
Every word that comes out
of your mouth is a lie.

1058
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,429
How do you live with yourself

1059
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,564
just lying with every word
that comes out of your mouth.

1060
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,736
[Duffy]
Big-ass crocodile tears.
I see through you--

1061
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:02,805
That's about enough, deputy.

1062
01:09:04,607 --> 01:09:07,409
You and your family,
you're, you're free to go on.

1063
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,845
-Wait, I have one more ques--
-No, deputy.

1064
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:12,181
You have no other questions.

1065
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,851
[dramatic music]

1066
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:24,193
Mac, your, uh, dad was greatly
admired in this community.

1067
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,762
It's a loss for everyone.
I'm sorry.

1068
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:28,764
