Nitrohlycerin himself.

343
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,465
Number 2 1 ,

344
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,806

That was 4/ 1 0 of a second .

352
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,491
That's how much time you have

353
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,829
after the ball
leaves the pitcher's hand

354
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,995
to decide whether it's
a fastball , a split-finher.

355
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,096
Wait, wait.
Hold on , hold on , hold on .

356
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,698
What you know about the hame?
You played in the majors?

No, l've just been
a Brewers fan my whole life

359
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:06,576
while you treated the team and
the fans and the city like dirt.

360
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:15,283
Yo, Boca, het this man

Boca.

367
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,176
Three more of these.

368
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,412
Three more hits.

369
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:45,651
As l said before,
Stan Ross is back.

370
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,589
Better talk to him , Boca.

371

MAN : l thouhht

00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,274
MAN #2 : He's a senior citizen .
Do you think l want him here?

377
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:05,503
And he hasn't played the hame
in nine years.

378
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:07,943
lt's not like we're in
the American Leahue anymore,

379
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,004
so he's hotta play the field .

380
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,518
Can he even handle first base
at his ahe, let alone hit?

381
00:19:13,585 --> 00:19:15,382
Fellas.

382
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:20,721
We are in fifth place,
and we are not drawinh flies.

383
00:19:20,792 --> 00:19:24,125
And we've hot two
very lonh months ahead of us.

384
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,960
The bihhest crowd
we've had all year

385
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,024
was the day we retired
Stan's number.

386
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:32,899
Now, we hive him a physical .

387
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,303
Give him a month
to het in shape.

388
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:37,308
Then after that September
roster expansion ,

389
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:40,311
if he's up to it,
we put him in the lineup.

390
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,310
Bo, all l need is a bat.

391
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:44,815

lt's called
modern technolohy, Stan .

Actually, it's very hentle.

436
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:51,200

Next pitch .
Now, wait a second .

713
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:37,452
What was it that Stan said
about the rest of his team?

714
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:39,689
The Milwaukee Brewers are weak.

715
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,890
Who they hot?

716
00:36:40,965 --> 00:36:43,058
They're a Little Leahue team .

Uh-huh .
Little Leahuers, huh?

719
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,001
Well , my 9-year-old
has a better swinh

720
00:36:48,072 --> 00:36:49,733
and better eyes than that.

721
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:52,469
Oh ! Just chillin'
at a called strike three,

722
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:55,808
and , well , that'll het you
some halitosis action .

723
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,678
Yeah , when you het just a
little too close to the umpire.

724
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:01,445
Stan's not done. He decided
to do a little sprinh cleaninh .

725
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,953
Either that,
or he just wants to symbolize

726
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,852
how well he's been playinh .

727
00:37:05,923 --> 00:37:07,447
Yeah , harbahe!

Now, l'm not honna say that
every Brewer but Stan had a hit,

729
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,659
but l am honna say that every
Brewer but Stan that played

730

731

Our Maureen Simmons was at
the hame and had posthame duty.

Not the day Stan Ross or
the Milwaukee fans had in mind .

733
00:37:22,707 --> 00:37:25,642
Word around the orhanization
is that manaher Gus Panas

734
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,543
is particularly unhappy havinh
Ross back in the lineup.

735
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:32,105
Apparently he hasn't forhotten
the way Stan abandoned the team
