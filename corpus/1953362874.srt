Ow!

105
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:43,980
Why are you hitting me?

106
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,454
Because it's more fun
than watching you stress.

107
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,649
Get out of your head.

108
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,726

109
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,761

- Soon?

113
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,703
Pussy.

114

Now you're in the Air Force, right?

115
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,811
Marines, actually.

116
00:06:15,908 --> 00:06:18,189
Yeah? I got a cousin that joined.
Where are you stationed?

117
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,217
I was in Najaf.

118
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,051
Down in California?

119
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,186
Close. Iraq.

120
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,261
Can I have another beer, please?

121
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:36,704
I mean, what are we

125

Our families...

126
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,681
Our families used to go camping
together, I remember.

127
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,588
And you were always the oldest,
so you'd end up babysitting.

128
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:59,787
I used to think of it more
as being a scout leader or something.

129
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,294
Or babysitting.

130
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,194
Or babysitting, maybe, yeah.

131
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:08,503
Oh, God, and your mom used to make us
sing the most ridiculous songs.

132
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:14,007
Shit. I'm sorry.

133
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,645
Nothing to be sorry about.

134
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,338
I know it was hard on you guys.

135
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:20,717
Yeah.

136
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,046
So, how long are you here for?

137
00:07:23,242 --> 00:07:25,051
- A few weeks.
- Then what?

138
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,487
Then it's off to wherever
they want to send me next.

139
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,197
HEY. Toni!

140
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:37,425
- We're right here. Hi.
- Okay.

141
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:41,906
- I'll see you.
- Yeah.

142
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:47,586
You guys won't miss these, right?

143
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:49,474
- No, of course not.
- Not at all, Toni.

144
00:07:53,706 --> 00:07:55,583
Hey, sweetie.

145
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:59,080
What's gotten into you?

146
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:02,083
- Matt, nice game.
- Yeah, wasn't it amazing?

147
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,327
- You out?
- Yeah, man, I'm out.

148

00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,851
You didn't tell me your brother was back
and all grown up.

153
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,317
Why are you so interested?

154
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:38,621
Because I'm an only child
and I'm curious about sibling rivalry.

155
00:08:43,422 --> 00:08:45,698
I wish you had told us you were coming.

156
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:49,135
I still can't find the extra sheets
for the foldout. I've looked everywhere.

157
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:52,241
Dad, don't worry about it.
The couch is fine.

158
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:03,883

So, you saw the game?

166
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,471
Yes, sir, I saw it all.

167
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,274
I'm proud of you.

168
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,270
You played your hardest.
That's what matters.

You want a beer?

172
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,771
Hey, Matty, what are you doing?

173
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,575
I'm getting a drink.

174
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,217
Okay, you got a drink.
Close the door, the power's out.

175
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,179
Lighten up, man.

176
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,617
Hey, don't you have to
secure the perimeter or something?

177
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,022
A rendezvous with douche company?

178
00:11:00,092 --> 00:11:01,799
What's going on?

179
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:35,239
Matty! We've got to find Dad. Come on.

180
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:49,378
I got no reception!

181
00:11:49,508 --> 00:11:50,509
Try the radio.

182
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,021
Son of a bitch.

183
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,086
What is this?

184
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,724
I don't know.

185
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,626
Shit.

186
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,524
Hang on!

187
00:12:18,637 --> 00:12:20,116
Stay on my ass!

188
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,103
Hang on!

189
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,437
Shit!

190
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:54,175
- Get to the cabin!
- What? No!

191
00:12:55,374 --> 00:12:56,478
The cabin!

192
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:58,295
Jed, take care of your brother,
you hear me?

193
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,050
Get out of here while you still can.
Go now! Go!

194
00:13:01,247 --> 00:13:03,454
- No!
- Come on!

195
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,694
Jed. go!

196
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:18,106
- Jed, we got to get Erica.
- Where?

197
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,369
Next right!

198
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,448
Hold on!

199
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,083
Pool!

200
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,130
Erica.

201
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,474
- Matt!
- Erica!

202
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,668
No, Matty!

203
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:00,145
Get off me!

204
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,613
Erica!

205
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,445
Matty!

206
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,526
Matt! Jed!

207
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:12,154
Come on! Come on!

208
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,421
Jump in!

209
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:16,959
Go, go, go!

210
00:14:20,492 --> 00:14:22,529
No, no, no!

211
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,436
No, that's my son!

212
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,011
They're just boys, okay? They're just boys.

213
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:47,592
- What do we do?
- Just follow us!

214
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:48,891
Come on!

215
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:04,206
Oh, shit!

216
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,089
- Jed!
- I know, I see it.

217
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,928
Jed!

218
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:41,142
Shit.

219
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:44,649
Come on!

220
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:49,293
- Go!
- Yes.

221
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:40,205
Anyone hurt?

222
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,707
I don't know.

223
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:44,013
I don't think so.

224
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:47,577
We had to leave, okay?

225
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,019
I'm Pete.

226
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,396
They're from out of town.

227
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:05,432
San Diego or something.

228
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,470
They just saw their dad get killed.

229
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,566
Okay, listen.

230
00:17:12,765 --> 00:17:15,939
I want you to take these guys
and see what you can find in there.

231
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:17,307
I'll get the generator going.

232
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:19,104
Jed, we got to find out what's going on.

233
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,172
My parents, what about my mom?

234
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:23,514
Robert, you're right. That's your job.
So, find a radio or TV

235
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,486
and get us reception. Get it working, okay?

236
00:17:25,611 --> 00:17:27,731
- But Jed, we can't just stay here.
- Say yes, Robert.

237
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,384
Yeah.

238
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,389
Okay.

239
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,346
Hook it in there.

240
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:20,070
<i>Coming to you live from Seattle.</i>

241
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,039
There.

242
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:24,441
- Is that it?
- No, no. Go back.

243
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:25,907
Freeze, freeze.

244
00:18:26,004 --> 00:18:28,143
<i>No longer controlled
by the government of the United States.</i>

245
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,049
<i>Dan 't go outside
unless it's an absolute emergency.</i>

246
00:18:31,243 --> 00:18:35,214
<i>A ccidents are more likely to happen when
people move about unnecessarily.</i>

247
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,516
Accidents?

248
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,221
<i>If you've become separated from someone
and you don't know where they are,</i>

249
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:41,594
<i>a hotline has been set up to help you.</i>

250
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,925
Hey, what the hell, man?

251
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:44,500
Bullshit.

252
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,362
What does that mean?

253
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:49,937
It means we're screwed.

254
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:09,517
Hey!

255
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,161
Hey! Do you hear that?

256
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,694
Matty, kill the lights. Let's go!

257
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,196
What are you doing?

258
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,565
I'm going to draw them away
and hope like hell they take the bait.

259
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,798
I'll come with you.

260
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:25,375
No, you're gonna be cutting the lights
and keeping those assholes quiet.

261
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,001
- What if I cut the...
- Just do what I say.

262
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,352
Come on, Matty.

263
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,005
No!

264
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:06,139
Stop! Hold your fire.

265
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,028
- What did I tell you to do?
- It wasn't me.

266
00:20:11,109 --> 00:20:12,417
You almost took my head off!

267
00:20:12,511 --> 00:20:13,751
I thought they got past you.

268
00:20:16,648 --> 00:20:17,820
You give me the gun.

269
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,026
I'm not giving you dick.

270
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,628
Who the hell put you in charge, anyway?

271
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,731
Okay, let's compromise.

272
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,134
What?

273
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,805
More?

274
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:40,746
Shit.

275
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,849
Give me that.

276
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,714
Danny.

277
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,485
Man!

278
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:49,856
Your dad said you were up here.

279
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,022
You saw him? Was he okay?

280
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,856
Yeah, but it's bad down there, man.

281
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,234
Where are our troops, Jed?

282
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,459
I don't know.

283
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,632
Toni.

284
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:05,600
You hurt?

285
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:07,299
No, I'm fine.

286
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,037
Fine.

287
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,211
Is Erica here?

288
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:15,085
I think they took her.

289
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,086
Everybody inside.

290
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:40,366
Wake up.

291
00:21:40,932 --> 00:21:42,002
What's wrong?

292
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,104
That asshole Pete and his buddy
took off with all the food.

293
00:21:46,204 --> 00:21:48,047
I need you guys
to take anything we can use,

294
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,041
put it in the truck and
hide it in the woods.

295
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,883
And that prick knows
where we are so keep your eyes open.

296
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:55,551
Matty, come with me. Let's go. Get up.

297
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:03,728
North Korea.

298
00:22:03,955 --> 00:22:05,764
It doesn't make any sense.

299
00:22:05,857 --> 00:22:08,667
There's a bigger picture here.
They had to have had help.

300
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,663
You think it's like this everywhere?

301
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:14,536
I don't think they've come all this way
just for Spokane and Seattle.

302
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:23,014
Where do you think Dad is?

303
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:24,778
Probably down there.

304
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:29,821
With anyone else they think is a threat
or they can get information from.

305
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,793
You think Erica is in there?

306
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:38,126
Your girl is a fighter.

307
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,230
She'll be okay.

308
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,640
<i>We got to get them out of there.</i>

309
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,908
We can't just call 911, Matty.

310
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:49,376
We got to stay put for now and just pray
like hell it doesn't get any worse.

311
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:52,247
Hey!

312
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:59,020
Hey! They found us.

313
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:10,528
There's no one here.

314
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,930
I swear. This is where they were.

315
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,535
Son of a bitch. It's Pete.

316
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:25,072
Holy shit. Daryl, that's your dad.

317
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,908
What? Let me see.

318
00:23:27,005 --> 00:23:28,643
Quiet. Stay down.

319
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,752
Jesus Christ.

320
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,866
<i>Bays,</i>

321
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:50,100
<i>it's Mayor Jenkins.</i>

<i>Captain C110 here is the acting prefect

324
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,178
<i>and he's given me his word,</i>

<i>I 'd like you to come home.</i>

Guys, shouldn't we do what he says?

331
00:24:43,915 --> 00:24:45,053
What do we do, Jed?

332
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:46,491
We don't move.

333
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:49,088
- But if my dad trusts this guy...
- Daryl, shut up.

334
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,067
Everybody stay still.

335

“N0! NO! 'Matt?! Stay here!

They're going to find us.

351

Guys, what are we even doing up here?

352
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,636
We should just go back.

353
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:45,865
Matt, I'm sorry.

354
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,873
My parents are still down there.

355
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,473
I'm worried somethings
going to happen to my dad.

356
00:27:50,802 --> 00:27:51,974
Maybe he could help us.

357
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,047
He can't help us, Daryl.

358
00:27:54,239 --> 00:27:55,377
He's helping them.

359
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:56,733
What's that supposed to mean?

360
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,719
It means he's helping them.

361
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,845
You saw him, he just stood there
and watched.

362
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,459
What else was he supposed to do?

363
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,221
Our dad made a choice.

364
00:28:05,283 --> 00:28:07,957
And Daryl's dad's got to make one, too.
We all do.

365
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,001
We're going home.

366
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,401
Robert,

367
00:28:18,496 --> 00:28:20,305
your parents aren't down there.

368
00:28:27,572 --> 00:28:30,280
I saw it. I didn't know how to tell you.

369
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,528
We can't go home.

370
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:46,963
We can't keep running.
What are we supposed to do?

371
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:52,675
I'm going to fight.

372
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,571
I'm going to fight.

373
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:01,908
Now this is easier for me
because I'm used to it.

374
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,281
But the rest of you
are going to have a tougher choice.

375
00:29:05,877 --> 00:29:08,756
Look, I don't want to sell it to you,
it's too ugly for that.

376
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,860
It's ugly, and it's hard.

377
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:14,495
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

378
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,257
and you're fighting for your family,

379
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:20,662
it all hurts a little less
and it makes a little more sense.

380
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:24,674
And for them, this is just some place.

381
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:26,771
But for us,

382
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,404
this is our home.

383
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:37,645
<i>Obviously, we don't stand a chance
against these guys in a straight-up fight.</i>

384
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,120
<i>Bu!' if you look at the Vie!' Cong</i>
<i>or the Mujahideen,</i>

385
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:43,656
<i>or even the Minutemen, it's clear.</i>

386
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:47,386
<i>Even the tiniest ﬂea
can drive a big dog crazy.</i>

387
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,902
<i>So, the first thing we ha ve to do
is learn haw to work together.</i>

388
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:57,365
<i>Became a unit.</i>

389
00:29:58,496 --> 00:30:00,806
<i>And that's going to take some time.</i>

390
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,806
That's gross.

391
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,679
<i>It doesn't take much to pull a trigger.</i>

392
00:30:08,072 --> 00:30:12,316
<i>But keeping your shit together
in a firefight is a whole different story.</i>

393
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:15,051
<i>So we 're going to ha ve to evolve.</i>

394
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:18,621
<i>Re wire our reﬂexes.</i>

395
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:22,363
<i>Learn new skills andadapt old ones.</i>

396
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:28,196
<i>There's alm 0st half a million faces
down there and they can't track them all.</i>

397
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,067
<i>So, we 'll find people we can trust.</i>

398
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:33,807
<i>Friends with their ears to the ground</i>

399
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:37,445
<i>who can help us get the things
we need to fight back.</i>

400
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:41,941
<i>We 'll watch what they do.</i>

401
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,916
<i>Study their tactics, their routines.</i>

402
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:48,587
<i>The more we know,
the easier it will be to hurt them.</i>

403
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,585
<i>Bu!' we 7f need to be smart.</i>

404
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,456
<i>And we 'llneed to be patient.</i>

405
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:56,321
<i>We 'll hit them an our terms.</i>

406
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,759
<i>When we 're good andready.</i>

407
00:31:05,797 --> 00:31:07,333
<i>We inherited our freedom.</i>

408
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,281
<i>[Vow it's up to all of us to fight for it.</i>

409
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:19,248
These things are bad ass.

410
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:21,219
Not if you know anything.

411
00:31:45,803 --> 00:31:47,612
We need to get better weapons.

412
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,980
<i>Your livelihood is our utmost concern.</i>

413
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,883
<i>We are creating a better world</i>

414
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:57,152
<i>where you and your family
can be taken care of.</i>

415
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:36,564
Forty seconds.

416
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,693
The weapons and ammo, get it all.

417
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:55,776
Robert, you okay?

418
00:32:56,074 --> 00:32:57,348
Yeah.

419
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,414
Let's go.

420
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,779
Come on, come on!

421
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,783
We've got what we need. Let's go!

422
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,789
Holy shit!

423
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:42,930
Hey, Jed. Isn't this C4?

424
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,266
I can't. This is stupid.

425
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:23,635
Yes, you can. Come on, just sight it up.

426
00:34:26,397 --> 00:34:28,343
Now, one shot, behind the shoulder.

427
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:30,812
Just relax.

428
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,542
Breathe out and squeeze.

429
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,613
Shit.

430
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:39,585
You got him.

431
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,174
What is this?

432
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:04,809
You drink the blood latte,
or the deer's spirit, or some shit?

433
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:07,374
It's not "some shit," Robert.

434
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:09,547
It's tradition, Robert.

435
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,017
Drink up.

436
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:27,359
Dude, it's not that bad actually.

437
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,730
No?

438
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,167
What did it taste like?

439
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,632
Well, you know.

440
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,336
- Hell, no, we don't.
- We never drank that shit.

441
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,579
That can't be safe!

442
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,161
Okay, you guys ready?

443
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,601
How you feeling?

444
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,461
I don't know.

445
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,903
It's all right, man. I feel the same way.

446
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,736
Look, I know we're outnumbered
and we're out-gunned.

447
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,070
But that doesn't mean
we can't make a difference.

448
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,473
So it's up to us to let people know

449
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,876
that there is a fight on.

450
00:36:47,071 --> 00:36:49,483
A fight that we need them to join.

451
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:52,553
Most of those soldiers down there,
they don't want to be here.

452
00:36:52,743 --> 00:36:55,019
So we have to make it too hard,

453
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:59,252
and too difficult and too bloody
for them to stay.

454
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:03,491
When I was overseas,
we were the good guys. We enforced order.

455
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:06,464
Now we're the bad guys

456
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:08,295
and we create chaos.

457
00:37:10,027 --> 00:37:11,472
We are creating a better world

458
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,873
<i>where you and your family
can be taken care of.</i>

459
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,807
<i>We are here to serve the people.</i>

460
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,923
Come on! Come on!

461
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,288
Move! Let's go!

462
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,724
Come on, let's go.

463
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,010
That's Captain Cho.

464
00:38:15,993 --> 00:38:17,233
Let's go.

465
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,714
Okay, 15 seconds.

466
00:38:38,215 --> 00:38:39,353
Who are they?

467
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:40,894
Collaborators.

468
00:38:41,218 --> 00:38:42,492
Had to happen.

469
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,400
Okay, here we go. Look alive.

470
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,382
Hey!

471
00:39:02,573 --> 00:39:04,075
Hey, Pete!

472
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:05,720
The Wolverines!

473
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,623
It's the Wolverines...

474
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:46,451
Dude.

475
00:39:49,854 --> 00:39:51,026
Dude!

476
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:55,270
Nobody move!

477
00:39:58,028 --> 00:40:00,099
Sandwich artist! Fill this shit with bread!

478
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:02,268
- What kind?
- I don't care! Just no flat bread.

479
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,570
- Wheat! Honey oat!
- Tuna! Turkey!

480
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:06,941
Shit!

481
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,112
Did they see us?

482
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,916
I don't know. Just get the food.

483
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,780
Go! Get the food!

484
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,796

Oh, my God, that was good.

489
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:33,665
I missed this.

490
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:36,073
You know what else I miss?

491
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:37,836
Pizza.

492
00:40:38,035 --> 00:40:39,412
Toilets that flush.

And it sucks.

496
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:46,416
You guys are amateurs, man.

497
00:40:46,877 --> 00:40:48,254
I miss girls.

498
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,517
No, not like you.

499
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:53,288
I mean like hot, sexy,

voluptuous girls.

501
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:56,988
Nice.

So why don't we just forget it?

517
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:22,650
Forget what?

518
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:25,851
That you've been putting
everyone here at risk?

519
00:42:27,444 --> 00:42:28,752
Erica's still out there, Jed.

520
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,186
And what happens when you get caught?

521
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,224
Because if it were me,
you wouldn't keep looking, right?

522
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:35,022
Not if it meant putting everyone else's ass
on the line.

523
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,392
- I'm not you, Jed.
- No, you're not.

524
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:38,862
The team has got to come first.

525
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,399
Get that through your head.

00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,901
Erica's my family, Jed.

527
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,333
She's more family than you are.

528
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:45,669
Yeah?

529
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,835
You're going to get us all killed.

530
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,715
That's how you get Cho.

531
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,569
The rally is at 2:00 at the main square.

532
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,176
So, decoy, like before.

533
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:25,244
A little car bomb goes off here.

534
00:43:26,203 --> 00:43:28,649
The crowd clears, security rushes in,

535
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,184
and that is when Mr. Big-Ass Mother-F
bomb under the stage

536
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:34,754
is going to blow that bastard
to kingdom come.

537
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,226
<i>We are not your enemies.</i>

538
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,797
<i>Because you, too, are victims.</i>

539
00:43:44,989 --> 00:43:49,233
<i>Victims afan American culture
in which greed, irresponsibility</i>

540
00:43:49,426 --> 00:43:52,168
<i>and fraud were openly encouraged.</i>

541
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:53,865
<i>Victim s of a corrupt go vernm en I'</i>

542
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,567
<i>in bed with the tyrants of Wall Street.</i>

543
00:43:57,501 --> 00:44:00,914
<i>It is our sincerest belief
that with the right lea dership</i>

544
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,675
<i>and with your support,</i>

545
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,377
<i>this country will rise again, better,</i>

546
00:44:07,378 --> 00:44:10,120
<i>morally superior to what was here before.</i>

547
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:12,928
<i>But we need your help.</i>

548
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:18,198
<i>We ha ve teams of engineers
ready to restore power and utilities.</i>

549
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,391
<i>But we cannot provide these things</i>

550
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:22,730
<i>until the situation stabilizes.</i>

551
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:26,635
<i>We must all arouse
the political consciousness of the people.</i>

552
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:28,442
Son of a bitch!

553
00:44:28,565 --> 00:44:29,566
What?

554
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,613
The guy sitting behind Cho, he's Russian.

555
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:32,940
Are you serious?

556
00:44:33,070 --> 00:44:34,470
The blue beret means he's Spetsnaz.

557
00:44:34,605 --> 00:44:35,948
Russian Special Forces.

558
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,246
What's his specialty?

559
00:44:37,441 --> 00:44:39,512
Counter-insurgency, for starters.

560
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:41,122
Are they here because of us?

561
00:44:41,211 --> 00:44:43,248
Well, if they are, they're a little late.

562
00:44:48,318 --> 00:44:50,559
You got to get out of here.
Some shit is about to happen.

563
00:44:51,221 --> 00:44:54,100
<i>So the collective states can rise again</i>

564
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:56,202
<i>and stand united again.</i>

565
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:01,666
<i>We are here to facilitate
this important objective...</i>

566
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:04,243
Ninety seconds.

567
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:08,383
<i>While a new social and economic</i>
<i>initia five is implant en ted.</i>

568
00:45:09,073 --> 00:45:11,713
<i>Illow, regular curfews
will comm ence tonight.</i>

569
00:45:12,242 --> 00:45:15,689
<i>They're designed
to preserve the social order.</i>

570
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,153
Daryl.

571
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:21,491
You okay?

572
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:26,230
Yeah.

573
00:45:30,761 --> 00:45:33,401
<i>But full compliance is mandatory.</i>

574
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:35,201
<i>Illa exceptions.</i>

575
00:45:35,399 --> 00:45:39,779
<i>The regulatory board
has suspended all visiting hours</i>

576
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:42,610
<i>at the United Workers 'Reform.</i>

577
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:47,714
<i>And so, it is with your well-being in mind</i>

578
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,447
<i>that we ask for your cooperation</i>

579
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:54,322
<i>in bringing these cowardly
Wolverine terrorists to justice.</i>

580
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:57,023
Blow it.

581
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:58,482
- It's not time yet.
- Blow it now!

582
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,632
Hold your fire. Do not engage.

583
00:46:21,812 --> 00:46:22,790
Shit.

584
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,392
Ambush!

585
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,225
Daryl, come on!

586
00:46:41,498 --> 00:46:42,875
Matt!

587
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,770
Erica!

588
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,613
Let's go! Let's go!

589
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,785
Ican't!

590
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,715
Oh, no.

591
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:56,417
Where's the key? Where's the key, baby?
Where's the key?

592
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,529
- Matt!
- We gotta fall back!

593
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:02,696
Greg, come on!

594
00:47:02,886 --> 00:47:04,388
Greg!

595
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:11,002
- No! No!
- He's gone. We got to go now!

596
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:12,469
Let's go!

597
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:20,974
Shit! Stay down!

598
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:22,241
Stay down!

599
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,485
90! "Go!"

600
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:08,422
Go, go, go!

601
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:49,770
Here!

602
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,304
Are you all right? Are you all right?

603
00:48:54,131 --> 00:48:57,169
Shit! We got to go, baby! We got to go!
We got to go!

604
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,055
Oh, shit. Get going!

605
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,735
Come on!

606
00:49:39,042 --> 00:49:41,420
Get in here! Get in here!

607
00:49:56,626 --> 00:49:58,264
Take what you need.

608
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:16,216
- Thank you.
- Be safe.

609
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:29,228
Don't worry.

610
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:31,661
Stay calm, we're almost home.

611
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:39,672
Danny, bring me the scissors.

612
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:45,250
I need more light.

613
00:50:52,149 --> 00:50:54,459
Toni, I'm going to need some ice.

614
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:56,324
Can you bring some from outside?

615
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,540
Oh, my God. Erica!

616
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:16,748
- Hey.
- I wouldn't go in there right now.

617
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,681
- Why?
- Julie's freaking out.

618
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:20,252
What does that mean?

619
00:51:24,714 --> 00:51:26,751
When you decided to run off

620
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:28,395
and do your own thing,

621
00:51:29,619 --> 00:51:31,963
Greg was killed trying to help you.

622
00:51:50,173 --> 00:51:51,914
It was a few days ago.

623
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:55,113
These Russian soldiers
came to the stadium.

624
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:58,255
They kept asking me who you guys knew

625
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:02,026
and who might be helping you.

626
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:03,823
And they even had a list of names.

627
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:07,294
Jed, all our contacts in town, man.
We can't...

628
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:10,438
Look, we are not a rescue unit.
We can't save everyone.

629
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:13,664
Wait. So we're not going to do anything?

630
00:52:19,002 --> 00:52:22,074
I didn't say that, did I?

631
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:34,921
You are guilty

632
00:52:35,552 --> 00:52:37,725
of giving aid to the terrorist Wolverines.

633
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,509
Shit.

634
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:31,282
Wolverines! Wolverines!

635
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:34,019
Wolverines!

636
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,822
Wolverines!

637
00:54:04,307 --> 00:54:06,947
Matt's been gone for days.

638
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,388
I'm worried about him.

639
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,052
Yeah, I know.

640
00:55:10,407 --> 00:55:12,944
What are you doing here, Matty?

641
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:20,090
Topping everything off.
Making sure the ammo's dry.

642
00:55:20,183 --> 00:55:22,993
That's great. That's where we need you.
Off on your own, doing your own thing.

643
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:25,259
- We really gonna do this now, Jed?
- Yeah, we are.

644
00:55:25,455 --> 00:55:26,866
I couldn't just leave her there.

645
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:29,594
- You left your post.
- What the hell else was I supposed to do?

646
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,238
I need to know I can count on you.

647
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,873
Well, maybe you can't.

648
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:36,636
What did you expect?

649
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:39,780
You think you're the first to feel this?

650
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,745
To see one of your friends get killed?

651
00:55:42,939 --> 00:55:44,509
This is war.

652
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,483
So rub some dirt on it
and get your ass back in the fight.

653
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,916
Spare me, Jed.

654
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,320
I left for three days.

655
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:58,157
When Mom died, you left for six years.
Right?

656
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,003
Yeah.

657
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,972
Yeah, Matty, you're right.

658
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:17,210
I messed up. I left you
right when you needed me the most.

659
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,520
And I'm sorry.

660
00:56:25,849 --> 00:56:28,989
I need you to be stronger than I was.

661
00:56:29,185 --> 00:56:31,392
- Mom and Dad are both gone.
- Shut up, Jed.

662
00:56:31,588 --> 00:56:33,158
It's just us.

663
00:56:33,356 --> 00:56:36,735
And more than anyone else in the group,
if I don't have you...

664
00:56:49,105 --> 00:56:51,745
Okay. Do what you want.

665
00:57:03,353 --> 00:57:05,560
<i>To the resistance fighters in Humboldt.</i>

666
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:08,167
<i>The chair is against the wall.</i>

667
00:57:08,358 --> 00:57:11,066
<i>The chair is against the wall.</i>

668
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:39,523
<i>And for the Wolverines of Spokane...</i>

669
00:57:39,722 --> 00:57:42,396
Guys, they're talking about us.

670
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:46,199
<i>Keep up the pressure, patriots.</i>

671
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,377
Wolverines, baby.

672
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,603
Wolverines.

673
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,125
It's beautiful, huh?

674
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,555
Very.

675
00:58:09,185 --> 00:58:12,860
I wish I could look at it
without thinking of Laurie Stewart.

676
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,364
What?

677
00:58:14,557 --> 00:58:16,400
Laurie Stewart.

678
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:17,970
Who?

679
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,108
Camping? Memorial Day weekend?

680
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:22,469
I have no idea what you're talking about...

681
00:58:22,665 --> 00:58:25,874
We had that huge barbecue
and I ended up getting food poisoning,

682
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:28,313
so I was in and out of my tent
all night puking,

683
00:58:28,404 --> 00:58:31,408
and that's when I saw the two of you
ducking into the lake together.

684
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:35,314
- Oh, that Laurie Stewart.
- Oh, yeah, that one.

685
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:39,286
Oh, man.

686
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,259
You know, she was a good kisser.

687
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,164
- She smelled like Aqua Net.
- What?

688
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,459
Hairspray.

689
00:58:46,956 --> 00:58:48,867
Shit, that's right.

690
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:50,662
She had that terrible haircut.

691
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:53,437
The one that I immediately copied
and wore all through middle school,

692
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,634
which you never noticed, by the way.

693
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:57,107
No, I noticed. It was awful.

694
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:11,783
Oh, shit. Go, go!

695
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,862
Go! Go! Go!

696
00:59:19,422 --> 00:59:21,422
- We're safer inside!
- No way I'm staying in here!

697
00:59:36,806 --> 00:59:38,615
Julie? Julie?

698
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:40,847
Julie!

699
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:43,854
- Danny? Danny?
- Robert, she's gone.

700
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:46,118
- We gotta go. He's gone.
- Danny!

701
00:59:46,215 --> 00:59:47,922
Daryl? Daryl? Can you hear me?

702
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,092
Come on, we gotta go. We gotta go.
Grab your weapon.

703
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,459
Let's move, come on.

704
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:13,910
Run.

705
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,790
Let's go, Matty. Matty, come on!

706
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:40,537
I gotta stop.

707
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:42,045
Come on.

708
01:00:42,572 --> 01:00:44,142
You can do it. I'll help you.

709
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:46,712
I got it.

710
01:00:47,343 --> 01:00:48,413
Let's go.

711
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,354
Let's go.

712
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,103
Here.

713
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:27,620
Jed?

714
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:35,002
You should try to get some sleep.

715
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,000
I'm okay.

716
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,871
You know, this was...

717
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,842
This was bound to happen, sooner or later.

718
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,639
Yeah.

719
01:01:52,675 --> 01:01:55,349
I was talking to the group, Jed.

720
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,119
They're starting to question everything.

721
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:07,598
Nobody's saying they want to quit, but...

722
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:09,893
Yeah?

723
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,675
What do you think, Matty?

724
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,652
Rub some dirt on it.

725
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:38,925
Who are you?

726
01:03:39,115 --> 01:03:41,857
You might want to answer that first.

727
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,765
Let's put down those weapons.
Then we can lose the masks.

728
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,035
What kind of shit-show did we drop into?

729
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:56,576
Sergeant Major Andrew Tanner.
Marine Corps.

730
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:58,270
We're Alpha Company.

731
01:03:58,467 --> 01:03:59,741
Recently un-retired.

732
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,210
Out of where?

733
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:02,813
Camp Pendleton.

734
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,076
When there was a Camp Pendleton.

735
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:06,981
Now we're part of the Free American Army.

736
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,655
Three guys?

737
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,085
That's it?

738
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,484
What good are three guys?

739
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,092
Hey, shit-for-brains.

740
01:04:13,482 --> 01:04:15,120
You're sassing a United States Marine.

741
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:18,822
All right, look, we're trying to link up
with a group of insurgents working the area.

742
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:20,193
Call themselves Wolverines.

743
01:04:21,123 --> 01:04:23,330
- You ever hear of them?
- Yeah, we've heard of them.

744
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:25,130
You here to help them out?

745
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:29,301
No. Actually, we were hoping
they could help us out.

746
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,246
We're camped just below here.

747
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:36,883
We got clean water and bandages

748
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:39,385
and another camp
about six miles west of here.

749
01:04:39,575 --> 01:04:42,146
We were gonna try and push on
after we ate.

750
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:44,752
We're the Wolverines.

751
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:52,556
I was afraid of that.

752
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:58,767
So how did we get here?
What happened to our defense?

753
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,233
It went defunct.

754
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:01,635
Shit-ified.

755
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,072
There's a new class of weapon.

756
01:05:03,432 --> 01:05:05,878
It caused a massive electrical pulse.

757
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:08,045
Everything went off-line
and never came back.

758
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:10,341
Grids fried, subs drowned.

759
01:05:10,873 --> 01:05:14,013
They mopped up by hitting cities
with tactical non-nuke warheads

760
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,016
and landed ground troops
where they needed strategic pressure.

761
01:05:17,213 --> 01:05:18,590
What about the Russians?

762
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:20,461
Shit, they got the whole Eastern seaboard.

763
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,889
We know they supplied hardware
and aircraft,

764
01:05:22,985 --> 01:05:25,431
but North Korea locked down
the Pacific Northwest.

765
01:05:26,822 --> 01:05:28,165
So it's over?

766
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,531
Over?

767
01:05:29,825 --> 01:05:31,395
What is this?

768
01:05:32,061 --> 01:05:33,233
A rifle.

769
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,935
That's right, motard. A
marine and his rifle.

770
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,947
It's the baddest shit-kicking weapon
in the world.

771
01:05:41,037 --> 01:05:44,280
And I'm still breathing, so it ain't over.

772
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,084
Far from it.

773
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,619
Lucky for us, they bit off
more than they could chew.

774
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,172
A lot of this country is still free
and up for a fight.

775
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,215
Hoorah.

776
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:54,818
Michigan to Montana, Alabama to Arizona,

777
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,828
that's still free America right now.

778
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:59,158
We're only 50, 60 miles from the border.

779
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:00,460
That's right.

780
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:02,832
And other places, too,
swinging back our way.

781
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:04,694
Wide-open shooting war in Florida.

782
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,397
Texas-Mexican border
has been burning for weeks.

783
01:06:07,763 --> 01:06:10,209
All because of folks like you.

784
01:06:12,335 --> 01:06:14,645
You've made a difference. Hell, you...

785
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,208
You are the difference.

786
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:23,484
So how can we help?

787
01:06:23,779 --> 01:06:27,158
What we can't figure out is how come
they're not crippled by their own weapon.

788
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:29,895
You guys ever see them using something
like this?

789
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,259
Hey, Matt, is your phone still working?

790
01:06:51,941 --> 01:06:53,579
Well, Semper Ff, Wolverines.

791
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:55,649
What is it?

792
01:06:56,178 --> 01:07:00,684
It's how they talk to each other.
A closed network for communication.

793
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,295
So it can't be hacked.

794
01:07:02,485 --> 01:07:04,089
But if we had it,

795
01:07:04,286 --> 01:07:07,358
it'd be the foothold we need
to start pushing them out

796
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:09,194
and take our homes back.

797
01:07:11,827 --> 01:07:13,329
And you want to steal it?

798
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,570
Rapidly.

799
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,764
- You good?
- Yeah.

800
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,410
They've fortified the police station
with bunkers on all four sides.

801
01:07:54,637 --> 01:07:56,742
A couple of mobile structures
acting as barracks

802
01:07:56,939 --> 01:07:58,543
that house the off-duty personnel.

803
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:02,080
There is at least 20 guys in there
at any one time.

804
01:08:02,278 --> 01:08:03,416
And a ton of firepower.

805
01:08:03,612 --> 01:08:05,683
I got a news flash for you.
There's no way in there.

806
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:06,953
Oh, there's one.

807
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:09,029
What, we jump?

808
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:10,958
Yeah, that's the plan.

809
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:13,999
That's not a plan.
That's a shit sandwich without the bread.

810
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:15,762
Cover me.

811
01:08:18,694 --> 01:08:19,832
Shit!

812
01:08:28,137 --> 01:08:29,445
I hate these kids.

813
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:31,879
Hate 'em.

814
01:08:45,287 --> 01:08:46,857
Son of a bitch!

815
01:08:59,335 --> 01:09:02,009
Hodges, you're with me.
Smith, you grow roots up here.

816
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:05,185
You hear anything that sounds
like Americans getting their asses kicked,

817
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:08,378
you make damn sure those girls know
when it's their turn to dance.

818
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:10,984
Any guesses where that little green box is?

819
01:09:11,247 --> 01:09:12,624
Yeah.

820
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,189
We're gonna follow the wire.

821
01:09:56,959 --> 01:09:58,768
Down! Down! Down!

822
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:04,537
Welcome to shit's creek, motards.

823
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:18,285
All right.

824
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,819
Our wire just split
into three different directions.

825
01:10:21,283 --> 01:10:22,421
Nothing's easy.

826
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:24,154
All right, here's the plan.

827
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:27,994
You two, take the back stairs.
Follow the line down to the ground floor.

828
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:31,333
Jed, Matt, you stay up here,
trace the other two.

829
01:10:31,794 --> 01:10:34,536
Hodges, you're with me.
We're going to secure the front door.

830
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:38,371
Let's find this thing
and get back to the hood.

831
01:10:38,567 --> 01:10:40,205
It's a good day to die, gentlemen.

832
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:42,441
What did he say?

833
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:46,814
Don't worry about it. Marines don't die.
They just go to hell and regroup.

834
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:49,417
What did he say?

835
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:10,337
Clear.

836
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,629
Dude, they're not gonna keep
their uber box under the frigging couch!

837
01:11:30,753 --> 01:11:31,891
How do you know?

838
01:11:31,987 --> 01:11:34,866
It's a vital piece of military equipment,
not your porn stash.

839
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,366
You got this.

840
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,554
My wire goes to Cho's office.

841
01:12:02,751 --> 01:12:05,391
And he's home... Shit!

842
01:12:12,261 --> 01:12:13,899
This is about to get interesting.

843
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:15,608
Matty, where are you?

844
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,157
Smith, you're on.

845
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,833
C'mon, ladies, show us your guns.

846
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:04,649
Shit!

847
01:13:05,914 --> 01:13:06,892
Come on!

848
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:24,638
We gotta get out of here!

849
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:27,941
Run!

850
01:13:37,479 --> 01:13:38,856
He was just here.

851
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:51,332
Keep them away from the box.

852
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,018
Shit!

853
01:14:18,086 --> 01:14:19,360
Not gonna happen.

854
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:50,029
Grenade!

855
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:05,237
Tanner!

856
01:16:11,567 --> 01:16:14,248
- Get that thing out of here. I'll cover.
- No, I'm not leaving you.

857
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:17,307
God damn it, Matty.
Get that thing out of here. Go!

858
01:17:31,113 --> 01:17:32,786
Matt Eckert!

859
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,342
You fucked with the wrong family.

860
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:01,913
Get this out of here, Robert.

861
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,786
Where's the box?

862
01:18:08,984 --> 01:18:10,019
It's safe.

863
01:18:10,118 --> 01:18:12,530
All right, let's get out of here.

864
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:24,435
It's pretty deep.

865
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,571
Yeah, but it doesn't hurt. It's okay.

866
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:30,149
Hey.

867
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,027
Hey.

868
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:58,004
I'm okay.

869
01:19:05,201 --> 01:19:06,908
I'll be right there.

870
01:19:09,772 --> 01:19:11,410
Collateral.

871
01:19:18,414 --> 01:19:20,587
Hey, can I talk to you for a second?

872
01:19:20,716 --> 01:19:22,423
Yeah. Sure.

873
01:19:26,422 --> 01:19:28,368
What's up?

874
01:19:28,591 --> 01:19:30,502
Nothing. I...

875
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,902
I was just thinking, you know, and...

876
01:19:36,799 --> 01:19:38,938
I'm not very good at this, man.

877
01:19:39,335 --> 01:19:40,712
Good at what?

878
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:47,587
Giving you props when you get it right.

879
01:19:49,545 --> 01:19:51,786
And letting you know that

880
01:19:52,748 --> 01:19:54,591
I'm proud of you.

881
01:20:03,593 --> 01:20:05,095
Yeah.

882
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:07,635
Yes, Jed. That's not one of your strengths.

883
01:20:07,763 --> 01:20:11,233
- No.
- No, it's not.

884
01:20:20,209 --> 01:20:23,520
So, how about that beer now?

885
01:20:29,051 --> 01:20:30,587
Wow.

886
01:20:31,087 --> 01:20:33,567
My first one.

887
01:20:37,793 --> 01:20:39,830
Where's yours?

888
01:20:40,763 --> 01:20:42,470
She stole it from me.

889
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:45,679
Go get it.

890
01:21:04,587 --> 01:21:07,090
Matt! Watch the back!

891
01:21:18,234 --> 01:21:20,612
Tanner! Cover me!

892
01:21:24,807 --> 01:21:26,184
Robert, get Erica out of here.

893
01:21:26,275 --> 01:21:28,983
- I'm not leaving without you!
- God damn it, do what I say, Robert!

894
01:21:29,145 --> 01:21:31,250
When you hit the deck, watch your ass.

895
01:21:33,349 --> 01:21:34,953
I'll catch up. Go!

896
01:21:42,725 --> 01:21:45,001
Help me! Jed!

897
01:21:45,695 --> 01:21:47,868
- Come on, Toni.
- We can't leave him!

898
01:21:48,030 --> 01:21:49,338
Come on!

899
01:21:49,599 --> 01:21:51,840
God damn it, Toni.
We need you back in the fight.

900
01:21:51,934 --> 01:21:55,381
Come on! I know. I know.
Tanner! Can we get out your way?

901
01:21:55,471 --> 01:21:56,472
Make it quick.

902
01:21:56,606 --> 01:21:58,176
Go, go, go, go!

903
01:22:00,142 --> 01:22:02,053
Move your asses!

904
01:22:11,887 --> 01:22:13,230
Let's go!

905
01:22:21,964 --> 01:22:23,307
Smith!

906
01:23:18,120 --> 01:23:19,827
How did they know?

907
01:23:23,559 --> 01:23:25,971
How did they know where we were, bro?

908
01:23:26,162 --> 01:23:27,732
- They must have followed us.
- No.

909
01:23:28,264 --> 01:23:29,766
No way they could track us.

910
01:23:38,407 --> 01:23:40,080
Daryl, lift up your jacket.

911
01:23:41,677 --> 01:23:43,315
Let me see this. Let me see it.

912
01:23:45,581 --> 01:23:47,322
Oh, shit.

913
01:23:47,817 --> 01:23:49,490
What is it?

914
01:23:49,952 --> 01:23:51,158
It's not a knife wound.

915
01:23:52,855 --> 01:23:54,129
They tagged him with something.

916
01:23:54,323 --> 01:23:55,927
Like what they do with animals.

917
01:23:56,525 --> 01:23:57,731
What?

918
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,371
They're tracking him?

919
01:24:00,196 --> 01:24:01,641
Daryl.

920
01:24:02,064 --> 01:24:03,134
You...

921
01:24:03,232 --> 01:24:04,643
- No.
- You led them right to us.

922
01:24:04,834 --> 01:24:07,906
- I didn't know!
- You led them right to us!

923
01:24:08,237 --> 01:24:09,807
Let go!

924
01:24:10,706 --> 01:24:12,208
You killed Jed!

925
01:24:14,677 --> 01:24:16,850
Matty, he killed Jed.

926
01:24:26,455 --> 01:24:29,197
You can cut it out of him, right, Robert?
Cut it out of him.

927
01:24:29,291 --> 01:24:30,964
There's no way. With what?

928
01:24:31,193 --> 01:24:32,570
Matt, we got to move.

929
01:24:33,329 --> 01:24:34,569
Let's just get back in the car.

930
01:24:34,663 --> 01:24:36,540
- Let's keep going.
- We can't.

931
01:24:38,267 --> 01:24:39,644
They'll find us.

932
01:24:39,969 --> 01:24:41,744
What else are we supposed to do?

933
01:24:50,679 --> 01:24:52,215
Robert.

934
01:24:52,414 --> 01:24:54,416
Get me some gear.

935
01:24:54,717 --> 01:24:55,787
What?

936
01:24:56,085 --> 01:24:57,655
They could be here any minute.

937
01:25:03,559 --> 01:25:05,004
Daryl.

938
01:25:17,473 --> 01:25:19,043
Can I borrow your SAW?

939
01:26:13,796 --> 01:26:17,437
So anyone want a lift back
to the land of the free?

940
01:26:17,633 --> 01:26:19,943
We got plenty of room.

941
01:26:21,737 --> 01:26:23,717
I'm sorry for the loss of your men.

942
01:26:24,607 --> 01:26:26,314
We've all lost something, Matt.

943
01:26:28,777 --> 01:26:30,188
You've done enough.

944
01:26:31,780 --> 01:26:34,386
You've done more than enough.

945
01:26:35,451 --> 01:26:37,522
I appreciate that.

946
01:26:44,093 --> 01:26:45,936
The fact is

947
01:26:47,596 --> 01:26:49,974
we're not doing too bad

948
01:26:50,165 --> 01:26:52,338
for a bunch of kids.

949
01:26:53,035 --> 01:26:55,140
We're going to fight.

950
01:26:55,337 --> 01:26:58,784
And we're going to keep fighting
because it's easier now.

951
01:26:58,974 --> 01:27:01,955
And we're used to it.

952
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:05,557
The rest of you are going to
have a tougher choice.

953
01:27:05,748 --> 01:27:09,161
Because we're not going to sell it to you.

954
01:27:09,351 --> 01:27:12,059
It's too ugly for that.

955
01:27:12,788 --> 01:27:14,734
But when you're fighting
in your own backyard,

956
01:27:14,924 --> 01:27:17,768
when you're fighting for your family,

957
01:27:18,494 --> 01:27:20,474
it all hurts a little less

958
01:27:21,997 --> 01:27:23,738
and makes a little more sense.

959
01:27:25,801 --> 01:27:30,307
<i>Because for them, this is just a place.</i>

960
01:27:31,640 --> 01:27:35,144
<i>But for us, this is our home.</i>

961
01:27:35,344 --> 01:27:36,982
Wolverines!

962
01:27:37,179 --> 01:27:38,317
Wolverines!

963
01:27:38,514 --> 01:27:39,993
Wolverines!
