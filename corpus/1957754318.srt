[music playing]

2
00:01:06,282 --> 00:01:07,463
Mr. Wong.

3
00:01:07,568 --> 00:01:08,784
Yes?

4
00:01:08,889 --> 00:01:10,243
I didn't mean to rattle your cage

5
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:13,164
but, uh, you've been a little difficult

6
00:01:13,268 --> 00:01:15,215
to get hold of lately.

7
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:18,240
Well, business has been going very bad.

8
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:22,932
I have been trying to find new curios to sell.

9
00:01:23,037 --> 00:01:23,905
Any luck?

10
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:25,471
You see all of this?

11
00:01:25,575 --> 00:01:26,896
Very rare.

12
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:30,094
It will, uh, bring good price in shop.

13
00:01:30,198 --> 00:01:31,415
Owner die.

14
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,909
I get very cheap.

15
00:01:33,014 --> 00:01:34,578
Cut the shit, Wong.

16
00:01:34,682 --> 00:01:36,386
I'm here to collect the money you owe.

17
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:38,646
I get money by the end of week.

18
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,801
I sell antique tomorrow.

19
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:43,061
Special collector coming by.

20
00:01:43,165 --> 00:01:45,355
You get money end of week.

21
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:47,787
I want the money now, or I'm gonna start breaking fingers.

22
00:01:47,892 --> 00:01:49,213
You tell Mr. Scott--

23
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:53,489
Scott wants his money, and he wants it today.

24
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:54,845
You take this.

25
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:57,069
It's very valuable.

26
00:01:57,173 --> 00:01:59,503
L-- look.

27
00:01:59,607 --> 00:02:03,326
I wouldn't give you 50 bu--

28
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,934
Please, Mr. Gus.

29
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:07,603
What the hell is this thing?

30
00:02:07,707 --> 00:02:08,541
No one knows.

31
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:13,478
What you think?

32
00:02:13,582 --> 00:02:16,293
I, uh--

33
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:19,944
I think I'll let you slide for a few days.

34
00:02:20,048 --> 00:02:23,177
But by the end of the week.

35
00:02:23,281 --> 00:02:24,393
No bullshit.

36
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:25,923
No bullshit, Mr. Gus.

37
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,055
Hey, Mr. Wong.

38
00:02:38,159 --> 00:02:39,898
Getting a new shipment in?

39
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,400
Many strange things.

40
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:44,730
My girlfriend really liked the necklace I got from you.

41
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,328
You got any more stuff? Can I see?

42
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:49,249
Sure, if you help me carry it inside.

43
00:02:49,353 --> 00:02:50,222
Here.

44
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:51,613
Let me help you with that.

[ominous music]

46
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:55,714
Really weird.

47
00:02:55,818 --> 00:02:57,070
What the hell is this?

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,789
What is this?

49
00:03:00,893 --> 00:03:04,127
I tell you, it very old.

50
00:03:04,231 --> 00:03:07,465
You must handle it very carefully.

51
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:09,793
Maybe I should carry it inside.

52
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,287
Fuck off, old man.

53
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:12,748
What's wrong, Kim?

54
00:03:12,853 --> 00:03:13,825
Nothing.

55
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:14,903
Just don't need any creepies like you

56
00:03:15,007 --> 00:03:16,676
and Grandma in our neighborhood.

57
00:03:16,781 --> 00:03:17,719
You crazy.

58
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,179
Give me the jar.

59
00:03:19,283 --> 00:03:20,117
Go away.

60
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,359
Fuck off.

61
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:27,870
[yelling]

62
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,130
Stop it!

63
00:03:30,234 --> 00:03:31,728
[laughing]

64
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:34,996
Leave me alone!

65
00:03:35,101 --> 00:03:38,194
Why don't you guys take a hike before someone gets hurt?

66
00:03:42,192 --> 00:03:45,599
You're the one taking a hike, asshole.

67
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:49,318
[grunting]

68
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,004
Thank you.

69
00:04:23,109 --> 00:04:23,942
I don't know what happened.

70
00:04:24,047 --> 00:04:25,054
They're very nice boys.

71
00:04:25,159 --> 00:04:26,027
Ah!

72
00:04:31,382 --> 00:04:32,216
Ugh!

73
00:04:44,557 --> 00:04:45,843
Be seeing you around.

80
00:10:29,785 --> 00:10:32,983
Honey, what's the matter?

81
00:10:33,088 --> 00:10:36,043
Can't sleep.

82
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:38,233
Want me to make you some hot chocolate?

83
00:10:42,543 --> 00:10:43,412

00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:14,560
Stop!

87
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:15,568
Stop it!

88
00:11:15,671 --> 00:11:16,541
Stop it!

89
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,790
No!

00:11:21,894 --> 00:11:23,285

[phone ringing]

94
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:57,005
Honey. It's Murray.

95
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:04,965
Why don't you let me tell him you're taking a nap?

96
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:06,043
That'll just make him crazier.

97
00:12:13,412 --> 00:12:14,491
Make it short, Murray.

98
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:15,706
I'm right in the middle of something.

99
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:16,889
Glad to hear, Howie, glad to hear it.

100
00:12:16,993 --> 00:12:18,140
Guess where I am?

101
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:19,218
HOWARD (ON PHONE): You're in your car.

102
00:12:19,323 --> 00:12:20,817
Yeah, but guess where in my car.

103
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:22,521
Well, I hope you're in the front seat if you're driving.

104
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,328
You must not be getting any, you know?

105
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,346
I mean, you're turning into a real crab.

106
00:12:26,449 --> 00:12:27,700
Fuck you, Murray.

107
00:12:27,804 --> 00:12:29,230
MURRAY (ON PHONE): All right, all right, OK.

108
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:30,273
I'll tell you where I am.

109
00:12:30,377 --> 00:12:31,489
I don't care where you are.

110
00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:32,776
I'm about five minutes from your place.

111
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,479
I thought I'd drop in for a few minutes.

112
00:12:34,584 --> 00:12:35,800
Listen, Murray.

113
00:12:35,905 --> 00:12:37,157
I'm never gonna get this novel done with you

114
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,164
breathing down my neck.

115
00:12:38,268 --> 00:12:39,277
What breathing?

116
00:12:39,381 --> 00:12:40,805
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

117
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:42,996
You've called me every day for the last week.

118
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,082
Every time you call, I lose my concentration.

119
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:47,028
It takes me at least an hour to get back into it.

120
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,106
Haven't you heard?

121
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,949
Digression is the spice of life.

122
00:12:50,053 --> 00:12:52,103
I think Faulkner said that.

123
00:12:52,208 --> 00:12:53,564
I think it was Raymond Chandler,

124
00:12:53,669 --> 00:12:54,954
and he was an alcoholic.

125
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,180
Oh, yeah, I could use a drink myself.

126
00:12:57,284 --> 00:12:58,952
Have one ready for me, will you?

127
00:12:59,057 --> 00:12:59,892
Murray--

128
00:13:04,827 --> 00:13:06,774
Trade you.

129
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:07,852
He's coming over.

130
00:13:07,956 --> 00:13:09,416
When?

131
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,425
Any minute.

132
00:13:10,529 --> 00:13:11,850
[sighing]

133
00:13:12,962 --> 00:13:15,325
Why can't he leave you alone?

134
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:18,941
Isn't it enough that you work on the weekends?

135
00:13:19,046 --> 00:13:21,131
I guess not when you have a deadline.

136
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:23,217
Thanks for the drink.

137
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:24,329
You're welcome.

138
00:13:24,433 --> 00:13:25,337
Mmm.

139
00:13:25,441 --> 00:13:26,971
[knocking]

140
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,861
- Hi, doll. - Hey.

141
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:36,322
How's the real estate biz?

142
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,060
- Fine, Murray. - Where's Howard?

143
00:13:38,165 --> 00:13:39,173
Is he upstairs?

144
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:40,354
No, the patio.

145
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:41,884
The patio. Oh.

146
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:43,344
Then, uh, let's walk down to the patio.

147
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,387
Come on.

148
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:46,195
You walk to the patio, Murray.

149
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:47,620
I'm going to do some laundry.

150
00:13:57,632 --> 00:13:58,466
Hmm.

151
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:09,937
Jesus Christ.

152
00:14:14,352 --> 00:14:17,899
Jesus Christ, no wonder you never get anything done.

153
00:14:18,002 --> 00:14:20,020
I'm thinking, Murray.

154
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:23,252
I bet you got a whole tree there.

155
00:14:23,356 --> 00:14:24,990
I told you right from the get-go I didn't want

156
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:26,380
to write a horror novel.

157
00:14:26,485 --> 00:14:28,675
I don't have a flair for it.

158
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:31,491
You need inspiration.

159
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:34,862
And so do I. You got another one of these now you're working?

160
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:44,318
You know, Howard, maybe what you need to do is go someplace.

161
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:45,396
You know what I mean.

162
00:14:45,499 --> 00:14:47,586
Get out of here and see something new.

163
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:49,081
It gives you a fresh outlook.

164
00:14:49,184 --> 00:14:50,784
What I need is to be left alone, Murray.

165
00:14:50,888 --> 00:14:51,931
I know that.

166
00:14:52,035 --> 00:14:53,217
But look what's happening to you.

167
00:14:53,322 --> 00:14:54,851
You're guzzling down martinis for lunch.

168
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:56,867
And all you got to show for it is a pile of trash out there.

169
00:14:56,971 --> 00:14:58,154
Eh.

170
00:14:58,258 --> 00:14:59,718
Just promise me you're gonna get out of here today.

171
00:14:59,823 --> 00:15:01,839
How do you expect me to write?

172
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:03,020
Will you promise me?

173
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,029
Will you?

174
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:07,122
Anything to get rid of you, Murray.

175
00:15:07,227 --> 00:15:08,201
Don't you have an olive?

176
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:11,294
A little onion or something?

177
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,267
[sighing]

178
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,180
Oh.

179
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:17,030
Listen, I-- I'm not leaving until you do.

180
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:18,664
Do you mind if I change my clothes?

181
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:19,706
OK, OK.

182
00:15:19,811 --> 00:15:21,306
But make it snappy, all right? - Oh!

183
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:22,279
Oh, gosh!

184
00:15:22,383 --> 00:15:23,600
Oh, excuse me, honey.

185
00:15:23,704 --> 00:15:24,574
I'm going out for a while.

186
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:25,685
Where to?

187
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,702
I don't know yet. Ask Murray.

188
00:15:27,806 --> 00:15:29,092
No thanks.

189
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,066
Hmm.

190
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,203
Man oh man.

191
00:15:34,307 --> 00:15:35,141
Hmm.

192
00:15:42,267 --> 00:15:45,570
[birds chirping]

193
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:04,377
[man moaning]

194
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:08,722
A little harder.

195
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:15,293
Looks like you have a visitor.

196
00:16:15,397 --> 00:16:16,230
Yeah.

197
00:16:19,324 --> 00:16:20,541
What's going on, Scott?

198
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:22,071
It's my day off.

199
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,156
You want a massage?

200
00:16:24,261 --> 00:16:24,922
No.

201
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,903
Are you sure?

202
00:16:27,007 --> 00:16:28,120
GUS: No thank you.

203
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,406
Hmm.

204
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,144
You should make some time for yourself.

205
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:32,499
Ah.

206
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:36,427
Well, you know, that's what I was trying to do.

207
00:16:36,533 --> 00:16:38,861
OK, girls.

208
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:41,885
We are gonna talk him into it later.

209
00:16:41,989 --> 00:16:44,528
Right now, we have to have a serious conversation.

210
00:16:44,632 --> 00:16:46,474
So just run along, OK?

211
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,413
OK.

212
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:48,874
But don't go too far.

213
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:49,881
Oh, that's so nice.

214
00:16:49,985 --> 00:16:51,480
Another one.

215
00:16:51,584 --> 00:16:52,627
Oh, baby.

216
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:53,566
Oh.

217
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:56,207
I mean.

218
00:16:56,312 --> 00:17:00,031
Hmm. - Hi.

219
00:17:00,136 --> 00:17:02,778
I'm Tina.

220
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:03,542
Hi.

221
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,088
I'm Trina.

222
00:17:07,193 --> 00:17:08,305
[whistling]

223
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,599
I don't give a shit what anybody says.

224
00:17:10,704 --> 00:17:12,998
I love bimbos!

225
00:17:13,102 --> 00:17:14,354
You got no argument here.

226
00:17:18,735 --> 00:17:24,053
Tomorrow morning I want you to pay a little visit to Murray.

227
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:28,329
I want you to make him aware that his due date

228
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,275
is around the corner.

229
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:32,987
And I want you to make an impression on him.

230
00:17:33,091 --> 00:17:34,378
You want me to break something.

231
00:17:34,482 --> 00:17:35,871
Well, I don't want to be that vulgar.

232
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:39,592
But 25 grand is a big piece of change.

233
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:41,678
Gamblers, they think they're so lucky.

234
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:43,972
And I want you to teach him a lesson.

235
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:44,981
OK?

236
00:17:45,085 --> 00:17:45,918
OK.

237
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:51,967
I miss your face.

238
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,784
You don't come by much, except on business.

239
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:56,973
Yeah, well, uh--

240
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:58,850
I've been kind of busy.

241
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:01,805
Yeah, I know.

242
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,196
You've changed, Gus.

243
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:05,004
I hope you don't mind my saying this,

244
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,689
but there was a time when you and I were so much alike.

245
00:18:08,793 --> 00:18:10,565
I used to know what you were thinking.

246
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,998
Now these days, I, uh--

247
00:18:13,103 --> 00:18:14,668
I'm not so sure.

248
00:18:14,772 --> 00:18:17,066
You want to know what I've been thinking?

249
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,430
I've been thinking about getting out of this crummy business.

250
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,411
Jesus Christ.

251
00:18:21,515 --> 00:18:22,697
Nah, I mean it this time.

252
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,088
You've just gone crazy over some broad.

253
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:26,834
It's got nothing to do with the lady.

254
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,241
Then that's obviously the problem.

255
00:18:30,345 --> 00:18:33,961
I want to introduce you to Trina.

256
00:18:34,065 --> 00:18:34,934
I've met Trina.

257
00:18:39,001 --> 00:18:40,148
I want you to meet her again.

258
00:18:44,737 --> 00:18:45,780
OK.

259
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:54,922
[music playing]

260
00:19:36,812 --> 00:19:38,724
- Good afternoon. - Hi.

261
00:19:38,828 --> 00:19:39,940
Looks good.

262
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,157
Fattening though.

263
00:20:17,484 --> 00:20:21,100
[wind chimes ringing]

264
00:20:41,401 --> 00:20:44,286
Yeah-- OK.

265
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:46,060
No-- Mom, this is stupid.

266
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,632
Look, I don't-- I don't care about the shop.

267
00:20:48,737 --> 00:20:50,822
I should be there with you.

268
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:51,795
OK--

269
00:20:51,899 --> 00:20:53,602
[sighing]

270
00:20:54,576 --> 00:20:56,593
Look, Mom-- Mom, listen to me.

271
00:20:56,697 --> 00:20:57,914
How am I supposed to get anything

272
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,999
done if I'm worrying about Dad?

273
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:01,251
And besides, he's the only one who

274
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,224
knows where everything goes.

275
00:21:02,328 --> 00:21:06,570
I-- I-- I don't.

276
00:21:06,674 --> 00:21:08,203
[sighing] OK.

277
00:21:08,307 --> 00:21:09,176
OK, fine.

278
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,089
Mom, I don't-- Mom, listen to me.

279
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:13,139
I don't even know how much to charge people.

280
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:14,878
Dad never priced anything.

281
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,130
No, he-- no, really.

282
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:18,598
He kept everything in his head.

283
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:20,022
[sighing]

284
00:21:20,126 --> 00:21:22,629
OK-- OK, fine.

285
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,473
OK.

286
00:21:24,577 --> 00:21:25,758
Mom, listen-- Mom, listen.

287
00:21:25,863 --> 00:21:26,801
Call me back in five minutes.

288
00:21:26,905 --> 00:21:28,782
Somebody just came in the shop.

289
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,868
Call-- call me back in five minutes, OK?

290
00:21:30,972 --> 00:21:32,259
OK. Bye.

291
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:33,266
[phone clicking]

292
00:21:35,458 --> 00:21:36,327
Hey.

293
00:21:36,431 --> 00:21:37,161
Hey.

294
00:21:37,265 --> 00:21:38,621
May I help you find something?

295
00:21:38,725 --> 00:21:41,263
Uh, yeah, but it sounds like you have some trouble.

296
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:43,453
Yeah, my father had an accident today.

297
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:44,774
Oh, I'm sorry.

298
00:21:44,878 --> 00:21:46,165
He's at the hospital now.

299
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:47,658
Well, is it serious?

300
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:48,841
Broken leg maybe.

301
00:21:48,945 --> 00:21:49,952
Oh, he'll be all right.

302
00:21:50,057 --> 00:21:51,587
Thank you.

303
00:21:51,691 --> 00:21:53,187
Can I help you find something in particular?

304
00:21:53,291 --> 00:21:54,368
Well, yeah.

305
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:55,411
You see, I'm a writer, and I'm just

306
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,252
looking for something, um--

307
00:22:00,173 --> 00:22:03,094
what in the hell is that in the jar?

308
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:05,319
That is the reason my dad's in the hospital.

309
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:09,385
He was about to throw it out when he fell and hit his head.

310
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,784
Yeah, but what is it?

311
00:22:11,888 --> 00:22:12,654
Oh.

312
00:22:12,757 --> 00:22:14,495
What it is is hard to describe.

313
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,693
Uh-- something left over from an old carnival or circus,

314
00:22:17,798 --> 00:22:18,633
I guess.

315
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:20,474
Where'd he get it?

316
00:22:20,579 --> 00:22:21,831
An estate sale, I think.

317
00:22:21,935 --> 00:22:24,403
You ever heard of the Arlin Reece collection?

318
00:22:24,508 --> 00:22:25,794
No.

319
00:22:25,899 --> 00:22:27,880
Well, a few months back, the owner went nuts.

320
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:30,487
He killed two of his employees and burned

321
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:32,294
his place to the ground.

322
00:22:32,398 --> 00:22:34,658
He had a private museum with weird and strange stuff,

323
00:22:34,762 --> 00:22:38,343
like this two-headed calf out front.

324
00:22:38,447 --> 00:22:40,811
This was just about the only thing that survived.

325
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,931
But my old man doesn't want to sell it now.

326
00:22:43,035 --> 00:22:46,130
- Why? - He gets funny about stuff.

327
00:22:46,234 --> 00:22:48,598
I don't always understand his reasons.

328
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:50,788
Well, I'll tell you what.

329
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:53,499
How about you sell it to me and you can tell him you tossed it.

330
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:54,751
- No. - OK-- come on--

331
00:22:54,855 --> 00:22:56,976
Sir, I'd love to sell it to you, I really would.

332
00:22:57,081 --> 00:22:57,914
I--

333
00:22:58,018 --> 00:22:59,201
Don't let me stop you.

334
00:23:06,987 --> 00:23:08,343
OK.

335
00:23:08,447 --> 00:23:10,151
Maybe he won't miss it for a while.

336
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,688
I'll write you a receipt. - Thanks.

337
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:13,905
[phone ringing]

338
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:14,844
Excuse me, please.

339
00:23:14,948 --> 00:23:15,991
Mm-hmm.

340
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:20,267
FOK: Hello?

341
00:23:20,371 --> 00:23:23,534
Hi, Mo-- what did the the doctor say?

342
00:23:23,639 --> 00:23:24,786
Mom.

343
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,080
Mom, Mom, just-- just tell me what the doctor said.

344
00:23:27,184 --> 00:23:30,765
[ominous music]

345
00:24:52,945 --> 00:24:57,254
Honey, what do you want for dinner?

346
00:24:57,359 --> 00:24:58,193
Howard?

347
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:03,234
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:03,338 --> 00:25:04,242
No, no, it's OK.

349
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:05,389
Come on in.

350
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:12,133
Whatever possessed you?

351
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:13,106
I don't know.

352
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:16,027
I just felt like buying something.

353
00:25:16,131 --> 00:25:17,904
That is the weirdest thing.

354
00:25:20,755 --> 00:25:22,596
Don't you like it?

355
00:25:22,701 --> 00:25:25,134
Seriously?

356
00:25:25,239 --> 00:25:28,332
I'd like to put it in the closet.

357
00:25:28,437 --> 00:25:31,636
Not after what I paid for it.

358
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,964
Just knowing it's in the house is enough.

359
00:25:37,337 --> 00:25:39,805
Yeah, but the shop didn't want to sell this to me.

360
00:25:39,909 --> 00:25:41,368
[laughing]

361
00:25:41,472 --> 00:25:44,497
Well, it would be a hard thing to part with, all right.

362
00:25:44,601 --> 00:25:47,487
He said it was an old sideshow exhibit or something.

363
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:51,693
Probably just a mutant unborn animal.

364
00:25:51,797 --> 00:25:54,995
Well then, you just had to have it.

365
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,699
I did have to have it.

366
00:25:56,804 --> 00:25:58,506
I felt drawn to it.

367
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:00,280
So I gather.

368
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:03,721
Now, what do you want for dinner?

369
00:26:03,825 --> 00:26:06,641
You. [laughing]

370
00:26:06,745 --> 00:26:08,171
Well, you can not have us both,

371
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,813
so it's either me or that thing.

372
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:13,837
- Well, I'm having both. - Howard.

373
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:15,018
- Peggy. - Howard.

374
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:16,201
[laughing]

375
00:26:16,305 --> 00:26:17,730
Put on a little weight, haven't you?

376
00:26:17,835 --> 00:26:18,599
Oh!

377
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:20,581
That puts me in a romantic mood.

378
00:26:20,686 --> 00:26:23,258
Would you-- [laughing] would you put me down.

379
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:29,237
Ah, you're not exactly a feather yourself, you know.

380
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,280
Oh, no?

381
00:26:30,384 --> 00:26:31,254
No.

382
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,173
What are you doing, honey?

383
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:39,944
I need to make love to you.

384
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:41,925
Need to?

385
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:42,864
Need to.

386
00:26:48,495 --> 00:26:51,103
Do you know how much I love you?

387
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:52,598
No.

388
00:26:52,702 --> 00:26:53,675
How much?

389
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,613
Hmm.

390
00:26:57,673 --> 00:26:59,620
About this much.

391
00:26:59,724 --> 00:27:00,558
Liar.

392
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,783
[laughing]

393
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:04,312
Oh, Howard.

394
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:06,989
Come on.

395
00:27:07,094 --> 00:27:07,927
Howard--

396
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:13,003
Oh.

397
00:27:13,108 --> 00:27:14,429
Mm.

398
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,653
Ooh, yes, yes.

399
00:27:16,758 --> 00:27:18,218
Howard, take it easy.

400
00:27:18,322 --> 00:27:19,504
Howard--

401
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:20,894
Stop.

402
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:25,066
OK, just not so hard.

403
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,074
Howard.

404
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,828
Come-- Howard.

405
00:27:29,932 --> 00:27:30,767
Ouch!

406
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,720
Ow, Howard!

407
00:27:40,813 --> 00:27:42,343
What is the matter with you? - Come on.

408
00:27:42,447 --> 00:27:44,498
I just want to make love to you. - Would you stop--

409
00:27:44,603 --> 00:27:46,097
- Come on. - Howard.

410
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:47,975
This is going too far. Come on, stop it.

411
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:48,913
Come on.

412
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:50,339
I said stop it.

413
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:08,589
Peggy--

414
00:28:08,693 --> 00:28:09,632
[gasping]

415
00:28:09,736 --> 00:28:10,570
Ah!

416
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:14,812
Howard.

417
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:18,948
Howard.

418
00:28:19,053 --> 00:28:19,956
Howard!

419
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,911
What-- what's wrong, baby?

420
00:28:23,015 --> 00:28:24,268
I gotcha.

421
00:28:24,372 --> 00:28:26,700
I gotcha, it's all right.

422
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:29,794
You are a bastard.

423
00:28:29,899 --> 00:28:30,976
What?

424
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,410
You scared me half out of my mind.

425
00:28:33,514 --> 00:28:34,452
What did I do?

426
00:28:34,557 --> 00:28:35,878
You know goddamn well what you did.

427
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:38,346
You put that goddamn thing in our bed.

428
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,980
Honey, what goddamn thing?

429
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,230
That thing!

430
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:44,359
That thing from the-- from the jar.

431
00:28:44,465 --> 00:28:46,689
I don't know what you're talking about.

432
00:28:46,793 --> 00:28:47,523
No?

433
00:28:47,627 --> 00:28:49,331
Then follow me.

434
00:28:49,435 --> 00:28:52,251
Come on.

435
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,511
If it is there, it's because you put it there.

436
00:28:54,615 --> 00:28:58,021
Oh, it's there all right.

437
00:28:58,126 --> 00:29:01,671
[ominous music]

438
00:29:12,309 --> 00:29:16,063
It was there, I swear it!

439
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,219
And I suppose I made it disappear too.

440
00:29:21,903 --> 00:29:22,773
Hon.

441
00:29:34,313 --> 00:29:35,148
Ugh.

442
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,549
Did you kiss your little friend goodbye?

443
00:29:53,363 --> 00:29:56,632
I'm sorry, that was a stupid things to say.

444
00:29:56,735 --> 00:29:58,231
And I'm sorry about last night too.

445
00:29:58,335 --> 00:30:00,073
I don't know what happened.

446
00:30:00,177 --> 00:30:01,186
Come on.

447
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,367
I promise you it'll never happen again.

448
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:13,804
[sighing]

449
00:30:33,097 --> 00:30:35,045
[phone ringing]

450
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:36,192
Hello.

451
00:30:36,296 --> 00:30:37,721
Hi, honey, it's me.

452
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:38,660
Hey, honey.

453
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:39,633
How you feeling?

454
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:40,954
Good.

455
00:30:41,058 --> 00:30:42,241
I saw the doctor this morning.

456
00:30:42,344 --> 00:30:43,492
And?

457
00:30:43,595 --> 00:30:46,516
And-- he says it's going to be a boy!

458
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,254
No kidding, a boy.

459
00:30:48,358 --> 00:30:49,193
Ah.

460
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:50,305
That's great.

461
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,383
That's really great.

462
00:30:51,487 --> 00:30:53,260
Gus?

463
00:30:53,364 --> 00:30:55,867
You coming home soon?

464
00:30:55,972 --> 00:30:58,579
Soon as I can.

465
00:30:58,683 --> 00:30:59,552
Are you all right?

466
00:30:59,657 --> 00:31:00,734
You sound kind of funny.

467
00:31:00,838 --> 00:31:02,194
Everything's fine.

468
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:04,489
I'll be home just as soon as I can, OK?

469
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:06,227
- Love you. - Love you too.

470
00:31:12,554 --> 00:31:13,979
Whoa.

471
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,907
It's finally getting a little class.

472
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:19,124
You new?

473
00:31:19,228 --> 00:31:21,244
Yeah?

474
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:22,322
Is Murray in?

475
00:31:22,426 --> 00:31:24,026
Your name, sir?

476
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,041
Oh, hey, don't worry about it.

477
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:28,544
I'll announce myself.

478
00:31:28,648 --> 00:31:31,568
Excuse me, I'm supposed to announce you.

479
00:31:31,672 --> 00:31:33,932
Yeah, next Thursday at 4:45?

480
00:31:34,036 --> 00:31:34,871
I'll be there.

481
00:31:38,312 --> 00:31:39,181
[knocking]

482
00:31:40,642 --> 00:31:41,719
Gus, baby.

483
00:31:41,823 --> 00:31:42,658
What's happening?

484
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:43,840
What's happening?

485
00:31:48,811 --> 00:31:50,896
I'll tell you what's happening.

486
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:53,156
My old lady's pregnant.

487
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,390
My grandmother hasn't recovered from her stroke.

488
00:31:56,494 --> 00:31:59,170
My doctor tells me that I should take it easy,

489
00:31:59,274 --> 00:32:01,882
learn how to relax a little.

490
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:06,784
So I come here hoping, uh, that you got some good news from me.

491
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:08,869
I don't like you coming in like this, Gus.

492
00:32:08,973 --> 00:32:10,956
You'll get your money.

493
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:12,240
You're damn straight.

494
00:32:12,345 --> 00:32:15,788
I never welshed on you before, have I?

495
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:16,725
Well?

496
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,428
Have I?

497
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,341
You've never been in this deep before.

498
00:32:22,844 --> 00:32:24,547
I keep having these fucking nightmares

499
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:27,015
that your meal ticket's gonna get writer's cramp.

500
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,927
He's right on schedule, I swear it.

501
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:30,560
I'm turning in the manuscript next week,

502
00:32:30,665 --> 00:32:32,230
and you'll get your money.

503
00:32:32,334 --> 00:32:33,828
Good.

504
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:35,428
'Cause I'd hate to tell Howard Hansen

505
00:32:35,532 --> 00:32:37,375
that you've been ripping him off for the last eight years.

506
00:32:40,469 --> 00:32:42,867
How much you figure you've taken from him, Murray?

507
00:32:42,971 --> 00:32:44,049
90, 100 grand?

508
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,757
Why do you keep doing this to yourself?

509
00:32:50,863 --> 00:32:52,392
What, you think I like coming here like this?

510
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,430
Take it easy, chief.

511
00:33:01,534 --> 00:33:03,099
Yeah, take it easy.

512
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:09,670
Why don't you go powder your nose, sweetheart.

513
00:33:09,774 --> 00:33:11,477
I need to use the phone in private.

514
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:12,485
I can't just go.

515
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:13,701
It's OK.

516
00:33:13,806 --> 00:33:15,266
Murray said it was fine. - Are you sure?

517
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,204
Yes, I'm sure.

518
00:33:16,309 --> 00:33:17,177
Go on.

519
00:33:26,772 --> 00:33:27,677
SCOTT (ON PHONE): Hello.

520
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,615
It's me.

521
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,832
Gus, make it quick.

522
00:33:29,936 --> 00:33:30,979
I had one foot out the door.

523
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,265
All right, I gave Murray the word.

524
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:35,984
Did you bust his jaw like I asked you?

525
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,739
Well, uh-- he knew I meant business.

526
00:33:39,843 --> 00:33:40,922
Gus.

527
00:33:41,025 --> 00:33:42,902
What the hell am I gonna do with you?

528
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:44,570
If you want to make an impression,

529
00:33:44,675 --> 00:33:46,100
you gotta do a little damage.

530
00:33:46,204 --> 00:33:49,091
Look, Scott, I don't think it's necessary.

531
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:51,036
We've never had any problems with him before.

532
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:53,192
He's at the bottom of the well, and you know it.

533
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:55,451
- Look, Scott, I-- - I don't want to hear that now.

534
00:33:55,556 --> 00:33:57,920
We have to talk about this, but not on the phone.

535
00:33:58,024 --> 00:34:02,716
Tomorrow morning, bright and early, be here.

536
00:34:02,822 --> 00:34:03,691
OK.

537
00:34:07,514 --> 00:34:09,426
I gotta get into landscaping.

538
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:16,170
[phone ringing]

539
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:17,769
Hello.

540
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:19,125
PEGGY (ON PHONE): It's me.

541
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,550
I was hoping you'd call.

542
00:34:20,655 --> 00:34:21,802
PEGGY (ON PHONE): I couldn't get anything done.

543
00:34:21,906 --> 00:34:24,097
I was snapping at my clients all day.

544
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,381
I'm so sorry, babe.

545
00:34:25,487 --> 00:34:26,598
PEGGY (ON PHONE): Yeah, me too.

546
00:34:26,702 --> 00:34:29,102
This novel's been driving me nuts.

547
00:34:29,206 --> 00:34:30,806
PEGGY (ON PHONE): I know.

548
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:33,724
Not that it's any excuse.

549
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,464
Anyway, I think I got this thing licked.

550
00:34:35,568 --> 00:34:37,237
PEGGY (ON PHONE): That's great.

551
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,705
So how about you and I do a little celebrating tonight?

552
00:34:39,809 --> 00:34:42,137
A little dinner, a little dancing?

553
00:34:42,242 --> 00:34:43,771
PEGGY (ON PHONE): Dancing?

554
00:34:43,877 --> 00:34:46,135
I can't even remember the last time we went dancing, Howard.

555
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,943
Then it's settled.

556
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:48,917
When are you coming home?

557
00:34:49,021 --> 00:34:50,099
PEGGY (ON PHONE): Um--

558
00:34:50,203 --> 00:34:53,435
probably not till about after 6:00, maybe later.

559
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,035
Whenever.

560
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:56,009
I love you.

561
00:34:56,113 --> 00:34:57,120
PEGGY (ON PHONE): I love you too.

562
00:34:57,225 --> 00:34:58,094
Bye.

563
00:35:05,221 --> 00:35:06,750
[knocking]

564
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:16,032
Hey.

565
00:35:16,136 --> 00:35:17,213
Long time no see.

566
00:35:17,317 --> 00:35:18,743
Carol McKay, I'd like you to meet the world's

567
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:20,273
greatest writer, Howard Hansen.

568
00:35:20,378 --> 00:35:21,907
Nice to meet you.

569
00:35:22,011 --> 00:35:23,054
Hi.

570
00:35:23,158 --> 00:35:24,549
Well, are you gonna invite us in or what?

571
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:25,939
Uh-- yeah, sure.

572
00:35:26,043 --> 00:35:27,086
Come on.

573
00:35:30,458 --> 00:35:33,135
Did we have, um, a meeting or something today?

574
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,089
I want you to meet your new secretary.

575
00:35:36,193 --> 00:35:37,446
What?

576
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,905
Carol, you know, this guy is the only writer

577
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:41,130
I know that hasn't moved into the 20th century.

578
00:35:41,235 --> 00:35:43,251
He still uses a quill pen and writes by candlelight.

579
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:44,884
[chuckling]

580
00:35:44,989 --> 00:35:46,936
I bought a computer last month just for you, Murray, remember?

581
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I remember, yeah.

582
00:35:48,395 --> 00:35:50,029
But you still haven't learned how to use it.

583
00:35:50,134 --> 00:35:51,732
So I figured that Carol could speed things up a little,

584
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:53,332
you know?

585
00:35:53,436 --> 00:35:54,757
You write, and, uh, she'll feed it right into the computer.

586
00:35:54,861 --> 00:35:56,357
Hmm?

587
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,408
Could we step into the kitchen for a second, please?

588
00:35:58,512 --> 00:35:59,519
- Huh? - We'll be right back.

589
00:35:59,625 --> 00:36:00,841
Come on. MURRAY: What?

590
00:36:00,945 --> 00:36:02,301
HOWARD: You've been a pain in the ass

591
00:36:02,406 --> 00:36:03,760
before, but, you know, this is too much.

592
00:36:03,865 --> 00:36:05,256
MURRAY: What? - Murray.

593
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,064
You know, there was a time when I actually liked you.

594
00:36:07,168 --> 00:36:08,662
But right now, I don't.

595
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:12,869
You're even starting to get on my nerves.

596
00:36:12,973 --> 00:36:14,294
I didn't think you'd mind a little help.

597
00:36:14,398 --> 00:36:15,684
She probably can't even type.

598
00:36:15,788 --> 00:36:16,728
You can't type.

599
00:36:16,831 --> 00:36:18,291
She types 105 words a minute.

600
00:36:18,396 --> 00:36:20,655
She's going to annoy me.

601
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:22,359
Humor me, please?

602
00:36:22,463 --> 00:36:23,854
She can sleep upstairs in your office.

603
00:36:23,958 --> 00:36:25,487
- You want her to stay here? - Lookit, Howard.

604
00:36:25,591 --> 00:36:27,573
This could be a major turning point in your career.

605
00:36:27,677 --> 00:36:29,416
I don't want to see you blow this.

606
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,744
As soon as you're done, she's out of here.

607
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:33,900
I'm not gonna blow it.

608
00:36:34,004 --> 00:36:36,646
Please?

609
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:38,419
Pretty please?

610
00:36:38,523 --> 00:36:41,200
Pretty please?

611
00:36:41,304 --> 00:36:42,870
I'm sorry we don't have a spare bed.

612
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:49,335
But, uh, there's a futon in the closet you can use.

613
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:53,855
Oh, my god.

614
00:36:53,959 --> 00:36:55,766
Look, if you don't like it, you can-- um--

615
00:36:59,137 --> 00:36:59,799
I'm sorry.

616
00:36:59,903 --> 00:37:00,877
That was rude.

617
00:37:00,981 --> 00:37:02,198
It's OK.

618
00:37:02,302 --> 00:37:04,596
I understand it's a bit of an imposition.

619
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:07,099
HOWARD: So how long have you been with Murray?

620
00:37:07,202 --> 00:37:08,037
You're it.

621
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,061
It's my first day.

622
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:13,286
OK.

623
00:37:13,391 --> 00:37:14,989
That's what I've done so far.

624
00:37:15,095 --> 00:37:16,450
It won't take me long.

625
00:37:16,554 --> 00:37:18,848
Hopefully, I'll have some more for you soon.

626
00:37:18,953 --> 00:37:19,683
OK.

627
00:37:19,787 --> 00:37:21,352
Uh-- make yourself at home.

628
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:23,611
If you get hungry or thirsty, you know where the kitchen is.

629
00:37:23,715 --> 00:37:25,175
Thanks.

630
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:27,157
Um, I noticed the gym set in your bedroom on the way up.

631
00:37:27,261 --> 00:37:28,860
Would it be OK if I used it--

632
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:29,904
after I finish my work?

633
00:37:30,007 --> 00:37:31,258
Sure.

634
00:37:31,362 --> 00:37:32,545
It's about time somebody got some use out of it.

635
00:37:32,649 --> 00:37:33,970
Thanks. I don't want to get flabby.

636
00:37:51,282 --> 00:37:53,055
[growling]

637
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,774
[ominous music]

638
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:15,964
Ah!

639
00:38:16,068 --> 00:38:19,058
Take it easy.

640
00:38:19,161 --> 00:38:24,585
You are just one big knot of tension, aren't you?

641
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,628
There.

642
00:38:25,732 --> 00:38:28,235
How's that?

643
00:38:28,339 --> 00:38:30,008
That's better.

644
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:32,406
You know, I had a dream last night.

645
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,587
Would you like to hear about it?

646
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:34,735
Sure.

647
00:38:37,551 --> 00:38:40,159
It was wonderful.

648
00:38:40,263 --> 00:38:44,782
We had this pretty little house.

649
00:38:44,887 --> 00:38:47,529
And it was in a small town.

650
00:38:47,633 --> 00:38:48,536
Not LA.

651
00:38:51,248 --> 00:38:53,716
And you were in the front yard playing with the baby.

652
00:38:53,821 --> 00:38:56,115
Was I teaching him baseball?

653
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,019
No.

654
00:38:57,123 --> 00:38:58,549
He was squirting you with a hose.

655
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:00,147
[laughing]

656
00:39:00,251 --> 00:39:01,920
And we had friends.

657
00:39:02,024 --> 00:39:05,431
Regular people.

658
00:39:05,535 --> 00:39:07,934
They respected us.

659
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:08,873
Well, that sounds great.

660
00:39:13,148 --> 00:39:14,608
Gus, you know, I was thinking--

661
00:39:14,712 --> 00:39:15,409
Ah.

662
00:39:15,512 --> 00:39:16,382
Jill, not tonight, please.

663
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:17,424
Why?

664
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:18,502
'Cause I'm tired, that's why.

665
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,962
Yeah, well, I'm tired too.

666
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,361
I'm tired of waiting for the phone to ring.

667
00:39:22,465 --> 00:39:23,856
And I'm tired of wondering if you're

668
00:39:23,959 --> 00:39:25,280
gonna come home at night.

669
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,540
Like I told you before, I can take care of myself.

670
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:28,653
Stop worrying about it.

671
00:39:28,756 --> 00:39:29,627
How can I?

672
00:39:34,979 --> 00:39:37,621
You just have to trust me.

673
00:39:37,726 --> 00:39:41,411
(CRYING) Gus, you've gotta get free from all this.

674
00:39:41,515 --> 00:39:45,270
I mean, you've gotta get away while you still can.

675
00:39:45,374 --> 00:39:48,607
Don't cry.

676
00:39:48,711 --> 00:39:55,489
Gus, I'm so afraid that some day you won't come home at all.

677
00:39:59,661 --> 00:40:00,391
[sighing]

678
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:01,608
[dance music playing loudly]

679
00:40:01,712 --> 00:40:04,041
That works.

680
00:40:04,146 --> 00:40:07,134
[weights clanking]

681
00:40:08,386 --> 00:40:09,256
She is fast.

00:40:16,903 --> 00:40:19,058
[sighing]

683
00:40:47,703 --> 00:40:51,318
[ominous music]

684
00:41:48,503 --> 00:41:51,180
No, no.

685
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:52,153
Courage.

686
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,368
It's probably just as well.

687
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:41,308
That'll do.

688
00:43:41,412 --> 00:43:43,985
[growling]

689
00:43:44,089 --> 00:43:44,923
Hello?

690
00:44:05,016 --> 00:44:08,597
Did you want me for something?

691
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:09,465
No.

692
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:12,560
I thought I heard you call.

693
00:44:12,664 --> 00:44:13,707
No, I didn't.

694
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:17,357
What are you doing?

695
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:21,806
Couldn't seem to write.

696
00:44:21,912 --> 00:44:24,170
Thought I'd at least make use of myself.

697
00:44:24,274 --> 00:44:27,021
I can clean this for a while.

698
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,002
I've never seen a gun.

699
00:44:29,107 --> 00:44:31,610
Up close, I mean.

700
00:44:31,714 --> 00:44:34,357
Was my side arm in the service.

701
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:37,450
Do you mind?

702
00:44:37,554 --> 00:44:38,910
Sure.

703
00:44:39,015 --> 00:44:40,023
Be careful, it's loaded.

704
00:44:42,977 --> 00:44:45,098
Does it have much of a--

705
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:46,418
a kick?

706
00:44:46,522 --> 00:44:47,358
Some.

707
00:44:49,826 --> 00:44:53,233
It could be dangerous.

708
00:44:53,337 --> 00:44:56,952
[dramatic music]

709
00:45:36,477 --> 00:45:37,416

Hi.

714
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,121
You must be Peggy.

715
00:47:22,225 --> 00:47:24,138
That's right.

716
00:47:24,242 --> 00:47:25,667
Uh, who are you?

717
00:47:25,772 --> 00:47:28,970
Carol McKay, Mr. Dunlap's secretary.

718
00:47:29,074 --> 00:47:29,907
Oh.

719
00:47:35,436 --> 00:47:36,270
OK.

720
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:41,137
You're home early.

721
00:47:41,241 --> 00:47:43,048
Man, have I been sailing today.

722
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:45,412
Howard, what's with the new addition?

723
00:47:45,516 --> 00:47:48,714
- You mean Carol? - Uh-huh.

She's putting everything into the computer.

I know, she told me.

726
00:47:52,572 --> 00:47:53,825
But why is she living here?

727
00:47:53,929 --> 00:47:55,703
It was Murray's idea.

728
00:47:55,807 --> 00:47:57,092
You know how he's been about this book.

729
00:47:57,196 --> 00:47:58,413
He's like an old hen. He's worried--

00:47:58,517 --> 00:47:59,838
It would have been nice if you would have

731
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:01,854
asked me how I felt about it. - OK.

732
00:48:01,958 --> 00:48:03,385
How do you feel about it?

- Hello? - Carol.

735
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:11,102
It's Murray.

736
00:48:11,206 --> 00:48:12,215
How's it going?

737
00:48:12,319 --> 00:48:13,500
Actually, it's going great.

738
00:48:13,605 --> 00:48:14,926

Maybe more.

Do you want to talk to Howard?

741
00:48:17,081 --> 00:48:18,507
No, actually, I want to talk to you.

742
00:48:18,611 --> 00:48:19,688
I need a favor to ask you.

00:48:21,426 --> 00:48:24,207
About a year ago, Howard tried his hands on a romantic novel.

745
00:48:24,312 --> 00:48:26,014
Uh, I think it was called "Thunder Over Paris"

746
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:27,614
or something like that.

747
00:48:27,718 --> 00:48:30,708
He hated it so much that he never showed it to anyone.

748
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:32,516
It's gotta be in his office somewhere.

749
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:33,559
He never throws anything out.

750
00:48:33,663 --> 00:48:34,706
See if you can find it.

751
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:35,783
Well, he must know where it is.

752
00:48:35,887 --> 00:48:37,139
I'll ask him. - Oh, no, no.

753
00:48:37,244 --> 00:48:38,495
Don't say anything to him or Peggy about it.

754
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:39,712
I'm cooking up a little surprise.

755
00:48:39,816 --> 00:48:43,605
It's between you and me, OK?

756
00:48:43,710 --> 00:48:44,822
Sure.

757
00:48:44,927 --> 00:48:46,560
MURRAY (ON PHONE): Uh, is he around?

758
00:48:46,664 --> 00:48:47,602
He's out on the patio.

759
00:48:47,707 --> 00:48:48,542
Oh.

760
00:48:48,645 --> 00:48:49,585
Then go look for it now.

761
00:48:49,689 --> 00:48:51,009
As soon as you find it, call me.

762
00:48:51,113 --> 00:48:52,817
I'll be at the office here until about 9:00 or so.

763
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:53,999
After that, I'll be at my house.

764
00:48:54,104 --> 00:48:55,041
All right.

765
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:55,980
MURRAY (ON PHONE): Good girl.

766
00:48:56,084 --> 00:48:56,919
Catch you later.

767
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:05,748
[ominous music]

768
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:12,320
[growling]

769
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:23,964
HOWARD: You know what happens if I call your office.

770
00:49:24,069 --> 00:49:25,599
They put me on hold.

771
00:49:25,703 --> 00:49:26,746
Come on, give me a break.

772
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:27,893
I am giving you a break.

773
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,179
You should have called, you should

774
00:49:29,284 --> 00:49:30,569
have said it was important, and you should

775
00:49:30,673 --> 00:49:32,203
have asked me about this. - I called.

776
00:49:32,307 --> 00:49:33,768
It was Murray's idea. You know how how he is--

777
00:49:33,872 --> 00:49:34,845
I don't care about Murray.

778
00:49:34,949 --> 00:49:35,923
He drives me crazy.

779
00:49:36,027 --> 00:49:37,209
I'm your wife, OK? Ask me.

780
00:49:37,313 --> 00:49:38,670
HOWARD: Well, what am I supposed to do?

781
00:49:38,774 --> 00:49:40,267
What are you supposed to do?

782
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:43,362
Figure it out, Howard.

783
00:49:43,466 --> 00:49:44,718
Holy Jesus Christ.

784
00:49:44,822 --> 00:49:46,525
You'd think I'd really done something terrible.

785
00:49:46,630 --> 00:49:48,889
Honey, all I'm asking for is a little bit of consideration.

786
00:49:48,993 --> 00:49:50,071
All right!

787
00:49:50,175 --> 00:49:51,114
I'm sorry.

788
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:52,435
Does that make you feel better?

789
00:49:52,539 --> 00:49:54,868
Not if you don't say it like you mean it.

790
00:49:54,973 --> 00:49:55,946
Ah, for Christ's sake.

791
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:57,059
I'm getting out of here.

792
00:50:22,435 --> 00:50:26,050
[piano playing]

793
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,185
[clearing throat]

794
00:50:34,289 --> 00:50:35,854
Eh-- eh-- can I-- can I get another one of these, please?

795
00:50:35,958 --> 00:50:37,870
Yes, sir.

796
00:50:37,974 --> 00:50:39,295
Oh, Mr. Beckman.

797
00:50:39,399 --> 00:50:40,234
Mr. Dunlap.

798
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:41,207
How are you, sir?

799
00:50:41,311 --> 00:50:43,641
Won't you sit down?

800
00:50:43,745 --> 00:50:46,283
Thank you.

801
00:50:46,387 --> 00:50:50,141
It was your good fortune that I happened to be in town.

802
00:50:50,246 --> 00:50:52,887
Well, perhaps, uh, your good fortune as well.

803
00:50:52,993 --> 00:50:54,452
Thanks. What about you?

804
00:50:54,556 --> 00:50:55,565
Oh, no.

805
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:58,415
Just some mineral water for me, please.

806
00:50:58,519 --> 00:51:01,509
I did enough drinking last night to last a lifetime.

807
00:51:01,613 --> 00:51:02,865
I know what you mean.

808
00:51:02,969 --> 00:51:04,359
These conventions can wear you out all right.

809
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:07,036
[chuckling] - That they can, that they can.

810
00:51:07,141 --> 00:51:10,165
Now, what kind of a novel are we talking about?

811
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:11,833
A romantic novel.

812
00:51:11,937 --> 00:51:14,023
Romantic novel?

813
00:51:14,127 --> 00:51:16,318
That's a little out of Howard's line, isn't it?

814
00:51:16,422 --> 00:51:17,882
Well, he's ready to branch out.

815
00:51:17,986 --> 00:51:20,490
Right now he's writing a horror novel for Randall House.

816
00:51:20,594 --> 00:51:21,463
Oh, I see.

817
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:25,599
Thanks.

818
00:51:25,704 --> 00:51:27,094
Aren't you going to order anything?

819
00:51:27,198 --> 00:51:28,310
No, thank you, I'm not hungry.

820
00:51:28,415 --> 00:51:29,597
But you go ahead.

821
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:30,535
Well, fine.

822
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,926
Thank you, that's it.

823
00:51:34,777 --> 00:51:37,176
Now, where were we?

824
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,983
Oh, yeah, you were gonna make me an offer.

825
00:51:39,087 --> 00:51:42,007
That was merely your assumption, Mr. Dunlap.

826
00:51:42,112 --> 00:51:44,823
You call me Murray.

827
00:51:44,927 --> 00:51:48,196
Why isn't Randall House interested in this property?

828
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:51,671
What makes you think they're not?

829
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:55,738
You better let me think it over, Murray.

830
00:51:55,842 --> 00:51:58,137
You know, I'll be honest with you, Calvin--

831
00:51:58,241 --> 00:51:59,736
Mr. Beckman.

832
00:51:59,841 --> 00:52:01,092
Look, the only reason I'm even here

833
00:52:01,197 --> 00:52:03,282
is because my client's got an eye on New House,

834
00:52:03,386 --> 00:52:05,125
and I know that he needs some quick cash.

835
00:52:05,228 --> 00:52:06,827
Now, if you're not interested, just say so

836
00:52:06,932 --> 00:52:08,114
and I'll take it someplace else.

837
00:52:08,218 --> 00:52:10,026
Don't get excited.

838
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:11,069
I'm not getting excited.

839
00:52:11,174 --> 00:52:13,399
Just don't high hat me.

840
00:52:13,503 --> 00:52:15,657
My apologies.

841
00:52:15,763 --> 00:52:16,944
OK.

842
00:52:17,048 --> 00:52:19,690
Now, uh, what kind of figure are we talking about?

843
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:22,158
$35,000 flat, and you could own it outright.

844
00:52:22,262 --> 00:52:24,314
That's a bargain no matter how you look at it.

845
00:52:24,418 --> 00:52:25,287
It's a good price.

846
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:26,574
A damn good price.

847
00:52:26,678 --> 00:52:29,841
Naturally, I'd have to run this past a few people.

848
00:52:29,945 --> 00:52:31,545
When could I have delivery?

849
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,969
As soon as possible.

850
00:52:33,073 --> 00:52:36,654
Assuming I can get approval, would it be possible to have

851
00:52:36,758 --> 00:52:39,331
it before I leave for New York? MURRAY: When is that?

852
00:52:39,435 --> 00:52:40,443
Tomorrow evening.

853
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,416
Oh, no problem.

854
00:52:41,521 --> 00:52:43,364
I'll deliver it myself.

855
00:52:43,468 --> 00:52:45,728
Do I make out the check to you?

856
00:52:45,832 --> 00:52:46,771
That's correct.

857
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:48,231
Upon delivery?

858
00:52:48,335 --> 00:52:51,255
Upon delivery.

859
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,044
Don't bother to get up, but I really have to get going.

860
00:52:55,148 --> 00:52:57,130
Nice doing business with you, Mr. Beckman.

861
00:52:57,234 --> 00:52:58,242
See you tomorrow.

862
00:53:09,505 --> 00:53:12,078
[phone ringing]

863
00:53:13,225 --> 00:53:13,990
Yo.

864
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:15,275
I'll make this quick, Gus.

865
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:18,266
And I don't want your fuckups anymore.

866
00:53:18,369 --> 00:53:21,777
I just got a call from the guy Maxwell, the paint man.

867
00:53:21,881 --> 00:53:23,132
What now?

868
00:53:23,236 --> 00:53:25,044
Go over and bust his jaw, or I'll bust yours.

869
00:53:25,148 --> 00:53:26,052
He's trying to weasel on me.

870
00:53:26,156 --> 00:53:27,095
Can you believe it?

871
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:29,285
He told me to go fuck myself.

872
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:30,814
Yeah, I believe it.

873
00:53:30,919 --> 00:53:32,066
SCOTT (ON PHONE): I want you to get the hell over there

874
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:35,056
and get the cash. - He ain't due yet.

875
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:42,287
Gus.

876
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,485
I want you to wake him up and get my money.

877
00:53:48,961 --> 00:53:50,038
OK.

878
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,360
I'll do it.

879
00:53:51,464 --> 00:53:55,600
And tomorrow, bright and early, be here.

880
00:53:55,705 --> 00:53:59,320
Yeah, yeah.

881
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:03,005
[music playing]

882
00:54:11,835 --> 00:54:12,842
Help me.

883
00:54:12,948 --> 00:54:13,816
Ooh!

884
00:54:17,014 --> 00:54:18,544
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:54:23,236 --> 00:54:27,721
You set my soul on fire.

886
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:33,909
Got me burning up with sweet desire.

887
00:54:34,013 --> 00:54:37,907
Been trying to keep my cool.

888
00:54:38,011 --> 00:54:44,720
But if I keep holding back, I'll be one horny fool.

889
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:48,440
Ooh, baby, just wanna love you.

890
00:54:48,544 --> 00:54:53,620
So let me hug you tonight.

891
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:55,496
Come on, baby.

892
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:59,216
Ooh, baby, just wanna squeeze you.

893
00:54:59,321 --> 00:55:02,171
Let me please you tonight.

894
00:55:02,276 --> 00:55:03,319
Where's Big Ed?

895
00:55:07,664 --> 00:55:09,610
If you don't tell me, I'll find him myself.

896
00:55:24,593 --> 00:55:28,035
[thudding]

897
00:55:32,693 --> 00:55:36,272
[drill whirring]

898
00:55:45,068 --> 00:55:46,389
How you doing, Big Ed?

899
00:55:50,318 --> 00:55:51,465
Doing fine, Gus.

900
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:52,542
You?

901
00:55:52,647 --> 00:55:54,384
Same old same old.

902
00:55:54,489 --> 00:55:56,783
Did Scott call you?

903
00:55:56,888 --> 00:55:59,077
Yeah.

904
00:55:59,182 --> 00:56:01,789
You ain't getting any more dough out of me, Gus.

905
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:04,222
I've had it with you fucking sharks.

906
00:56:04,326 --> 00:56:05,405
Ha.

907
00:56:05,509 --> 00:56:07,559
I can't believe you're talking to me this way.

908
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:10,445
I mean, didn't Scott bail you out when you was in deep?

909
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:13,400
Now you want me to tell the man to go fuck himself.

910
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:17,154
I think these paint fumes have been getting to your head.

911
00:56:17,259 --> 00:56:18,440
Take a hike, man.

912
00:56:18,544 --> 00:56:20,318
I don't need to pay you or anybody else.

913
00:56:20,422 --> 00:56:21,882
Hey.

914
00:56:21,986 --> 00:56:26,263
One phone call from me to the cops, you all go to jail.

915
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,410
Give me the money, Ed.

916
00:56:35,126 --> 00:56:37,144
You know what?

917
00:56:37,248 --> 00:56:39,994
You can go fuck yourself too, Gus.

918
00:56:40,098 --> 00:56:41,071
Is that the way you want it?

919
00:56:47,120 --> 00:56:49,448
Ugh!

920
00:56:49,553 --> 00:56:51,048
[yelling]

921
00:56:51,152 --> 00:56:52,473
Ugh!

922
00:56:52,577 --> 00:56:54,872
Ugh!

923
00:56:54,977 --> 00:56:58,452
[grunting]

924
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:21,744
Give me the money, Ed.

925
00:57:29,356 --> 00:57:32,311
I want the rest by next week, OK?

926
00:57:32,416 --> 00:57:34,084
OK, Gus.

927
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:35,057
Good.

928
00:57:35,161 --> 00:57:36,136
[music playing]

929
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:37,491
(SINGING) Baby, just wanna squeeze you.

930
00:57:37,595 --> 00:57:38,465
Squeeze you.

931
00:57:38,568 --> 00:57:41,976
Let me please you tonight.

932
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:43,992
Tonight, tonight.

933
00:57:44,096 --> 00:57:46,529
Since we last met, I kept it all in check.

934
00:57:46,633 --> 00:57:48,302
But now he's getting out of hand,

935
00:57:48,406 --> 00:57:50,736
and you can surely bet he's gonna track you down.

936
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:53,204
And when you're finally found, he's gonna do what he do

937
00:57:53,308 --> 00:57:55,046
and take a bite out of you.

938
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:32,555
[suspenseful music]

939
00:58:43,054 --> 00:58:43,992
Ah, finally.

940
00:58:54,526 --> 00:58:57,098
[growling]

941
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:22,510
[knocking]

942
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,183
Peg.

943
00:59:29,288 --> 00:59:38,917
Um-- I'm sorry, Peg.

944
00:59:39,022 --> 00:59:41,768
You were right about this afternoon.

945
00:59:41,873 --> 00:59:44,132
I don't know why I got so bent out of shape.

946
00:59:47,503 --> 00:59:49,555
I never want to hurt you, Peg.

947
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:51,918
It's not called "Thunder Over Paris."

948
00:59:52,023 --> 00:59:53,274
It's called "Thunder Over Hawaii."

949
00:59:53,378 --> 00:59:54,699
MURRAY (ON PHONE): Beautiful.

950
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:56,229
I'll pick it up in the morning.

951
00:59:56,333 --> 00:59:57,654
What time?

952
00:59:57,759 --> 00:59:58,767
MURRAY (ON PHONE): Uh, say between 8:30 and 9:00.

953
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,957
And remember-- - I know.

954
01:00:01,061 --> 01:00:01,895
It's a secret.

955
01:00:08,500 --> 01:00:10,308
There's something bothering you, isn't there?

956
01:00:13,125 --> 01:00:14,306
I have to tell you, Peg.

957
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:20,320
Um-- I think the reason I blew up at you--

958
01:00:20,424 --> 01:00:21,884
because I was feeling guilty.

959
01:00:36,276 --> 01:00:37,840
You know, honey, the sooner she's out of here,

960
01:00:37,944 --> 01:00:39,647
the better I'll feel.

961
01:00:39,751 --> 01:00:40,587
Thank you.

962
01:00:45,836 --> 01:00:48,234
Maybe she's not the problem.

963
01:00:48,338 --> 01:00:50,251
You mean we're the problem?

964
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,449
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

965
01:00:53,553 --> 01:00:55,430
You think it's that thing in the jar, don't you?

966
01:00:55,534 --> 01:00:57,064
Yes.

967
01:00:57,168 --> 01:00:59,776
I mean, it's like there's some dark force gripping this house.

968
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:09,336
Listen to yourself, would you, honey?

969
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,552
Come on.

970
01:01:10,656 --> 01:01:12,186
You sound like a little kid, and you're

971
01:01:12,290 --> 01:01:15,766
trying to blame our problems on a dead thing in a pickle jar.

972
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:19,416
I don't know.

973
01:01:19,521 --> 01:01:21,120
I'm scared.

974
01:01:21,224 --> 01:01:22,093
Don't be.

975
01:01:25,361 --> 01:01:26,925
Where are you going?

976
01:01:27,029 --> 01:01:28,872
I'm getting rid of that jar.

977
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:30,019
And when I'm done with this book,

978
01:01:30,123 --> 01:01:31,375
we're going on a long vacation.

979
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:45,697
Howard--

980
01:01:45,801 --> 01:01:47,366
I don't think so, Howie.

981
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:51,606
Howard?

982
01:02:08,745 --> 01:02:09,717
Howard?

983
01:02:09,823 --> 01:02:10,692
We're in here.

984
01:02:17,018 --> 01:02:19,139
Come on in, Peg.

985
01:02:19,243 --> 01:02:20,460
Carol, listen to me--

986
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:21,954
No, you listen to me.

987
01:02:22,059 --> 01:02:24,075
I'm in charge now.

988
01:02:24,179 --> 01:02:25,152
You're not in charge.

989
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:28,351
That thing is in charge.

990
01:02:28,456 --> 01:02:31,028
Take off your clothes.

991
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:31,897
What?

992
01:02:32,001 --> 01:02:32,871
You heard me.

993
01:02:32,975 --> 01:02:34,851
Take off your clothes.

994
01:02:34,956 --> 01:02:36,416
We don't need her.

995
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,449
Shut up. Do it.

996
01:02:40,553 --> 01:02:41,387
Now!

997
01:02:44,724 --> 01:02:47,227
Have a little fun with it, Peg.

998
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:49,313
Come on.

999
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:51,989
Better.

1000
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,450
That's it.

1001
01:02:53,554 --> 01:02:54,423
Let's see it.

1002
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:02,279
Come on.

1003
01:03:07,981 --> 01:03:10,379
That's better.

1004
01:03:10,483 --> 01:03:11,596
Get over here.

1005
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:12,535
Come on.

1006
01:03:21,434 --> 01:03:23,833
That's nice.

1007
01:03:23,936 --> 01:03:25,501
OK.

1008
01:03:25,605 --> 01:03:28,004
Come.

1009
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,186
Come on.

1010
01:03:34,296 --> 01:03:37,912
[erotic music]

1011
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:44,411
Now get busy.

1012
01:03:53,555 --> 01:03:54,702
The bra, Howie.

1013
01:03:54,806 --> 01:03:56,892
Come on, take it off.

1014
01:03:56,996 --> 01:03:57,935
Rip it off.

1015
01:03:58,039 --> 01:03:59,394
Ah!

1016
01:03:59,499 --> 01:04:01,133
That's it.

1017
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:02,107
Ah!

1018
01:04:10,970 --> 01:04:12,083
That's it.

1019
01:05:11,353 --> 01:05:14,969
[moaning]

1020
01:06:11,736 --> 01:06:14,448
[growling]

1021
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:20,080
You can't squeeze blood out of a turnip.

1022
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:22,270
Murray isn't a turnip.

1023
01:06:22,374 --> 01:06:24,077
You push him too hard, he's gonna fold.

1024
01:06:24,181 --> 01:06:27,936
You don't push him, you'll walk away with nothing.

1025
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:30,334
Yeah, well, you run that risk anyways.

1026
01:06:30,438 --> 01:06:31,377
Sit down.

1027
01:06:31,481 --> 01:06:32,907
No, I don't want to sit down.

1028
01:06:33,012 --> 01:06:34,437
I know, but I want you to sit down.

1029
01:06:34,541 --> 01:06:36,592
I don't like people talking to me looking down at me.

1030
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:45,665
I think you're making a mistake, Scott.

1031
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:48,690
Let me tell you something about human nature.

1032
01:06:48,794 --> 01:06:51,123
You give a guy a deadline, especially

1033
01:06:51,228 --> 01:06:54,564
a sleaze like Murray, and right away he begins to wonder

1034
01:06:54,669 --> 01:06:56,963
if you really mean it.

1035
01:06:57,067 --> 01:06:59,397
And when there's money involved, he

1036
01:06:59,501 --> 01:07:02,803
begins to convince himself that you don't mean it,

1037
01:07:02,907 --> 01:07:06,174
especially since he is running on empty.

1038
01:07:13,232 --> 01:07:14,343
Ah.

1039
01:07:14,449 --> 01:07:16,603
Man, I told you before, that shit's out.

1040
01:07:16,707 --> 01:07:17,855
I'm no shooter.

1041
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,698
I'm not asking you to use it.

1042
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,027
Just flash it.

1043
01:07:22,132 --> 01:07:23,383
Sit down.

1044
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:24,530
Not this time, Scott.

1045
01:07:24,634 --> 01:07:25,677
I want out.

1046
01:07:25,781 --> 01:07:27,588
You're getting too goddamn greedy.

1047
01:07:27,693 --> 01:07:30,300
Greed makes the world go 'round.

1048
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:33,116
Yeah, maybe your world, but not mine.

1049
01:07:33,221 --> 01:07:36,105
Half.

1050
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,461
What are you talking about?

1051
01:07:37,565 --> 01:07:39,756
I'll give you half of what I get from Murray.

1052
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:42,433
$12,500.

1053
01:07:42,537 --> 01:07:43,476
I don't get it.

1054
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:46,257
From now on, we split 50/50.

1055
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:47,229
I'm making you my partner.

1056
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,843
Why, Scott?

1057
01:07:54,947 --> 01:07:56,998
Because I need a partner.

1058
01:07:57,102 --> 01:07:58,389
I'm tired.

1059
01:07:58,492 --> 01:08:01,413
And you are the only son of a bitch that I trust.

1060
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:22,618
Welcome to my world.

1061
01:08:22,722 --> 01:08:23,625
[gunshot]

1062
01:08:27,623 --> 01:08:30,788
In your world, Scott, you can't trust nobody.

1063
01:08:35,516 --> 01:08:37,914
You wanna know what I'm gonna do?

1064
01:08:38,017 --> 01:08:40,382
I'm gonna go tell Murray he's off the hook.

1065
01:08:40,486 --> 01:08:43,024
That you won't be needing the money anymore.

1066
01:08:55,016 --> 01:08:56,269
Good morning.

1067
01:08:56,373 --> 01:08:59,084
Sleep well?

1068
01:08:59,188 --> 01:09:00,371
I didn't.

1069
01:09:00,475 --> 01:09:04,716
I've been up all night thinking.

1070
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:06,037
I'll make some coffee.

1071
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:09,444
You know what I've been thinking about?

1072
01:09:09,548 --> 01:09:10,904
No.

1073
01:09:11,008 --> 01:09:12,433
I've been thinking about how I've

1074
01:09:12,538 --> 01:09:16,084
never really been able to do the things I wanted to do.

1075
01:09:16,188 --> 01:09:17,509
You did pretty well last night.

1076
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:24,877
Yeah.

1077
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:28,875
We had fun, didn't we?

1078
01:09:28,981 --> 01:09:32,422
Sit down.

1079
01:09:32,526 --> 01:09:34,681
Why don't I go get the coffee started?

1080
01:09:34,786 --> 01:09:35,724
[gun cocking]

1081
01:09:36,836 --> 01:09:37,775
Sit down.

1082
01:09:46,500 --> 01:09:48,759
You've slipped back, haven't you?

1083
01:09:48,864 --> 01:09:50,429
I don't know what you mean.

1084
01:09:50,533 --> 01:09:53,210
Yes, you do.

1085
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:55,052
You've been away from him too long.

1086
01:09:59,293 --> 01:10:02,317
I'm scared of him, Carol.

1087
01:10:02,421 --> 01:10:07,289
He doesn't make you do anything you don't want to do.

1088
01:10:07,393 --> 01:10:12,190
You know, for the first time in my life, I feel in control.

1089
01:10:12,294 --> 01:10:15,597
I was told what to think and how to feel for so long.

1090
01:10:15,701 --> 01:10:19,177
I don't know what I feel anymore.

1091
01:10:19,282 --> 01:10:20,811
That is until he came along.

1092
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:27,172
Let's discuss this further over a cup coffee, OK?

1093
01:10:27,276 --> 01:10:28,147
Don't be long.

1094
01:10:35,863 --> 01:10:39,479
[suspenseful music]

1095
01:10:57,973 --> 01:11:00,372
You know what else I was thinking?

1096
01:11:00,476 --> 01:11:02,596
What?

1097
01:11:02,701 --> 01:11:06,524
I was wondering what it would be like to kill someone.

1098
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:07,984
How pleasant.

1099
01:11:08,088 --> 01:11:09,479
Seriously.

1100
01:11:09,584 --> 01:11:16,327
If you wanted to kill someone, how would you do it?

1101
01:11:16,431 --> 01:11:19,631
I never really thought about it.

1102
01:11:19,735 --> 01:11:23,627
Well, think about it.

1103
01:11:23,732 --> 01:11:27,660
Would you poison them?

1104
01:11:27,764 --> 01:11:28,877
Stab 'em?

1105
01:11:28,981 --> 01:11:31,449
- I don't want to kill anyone. - Never?

1106
01:11:31,553 --> 01:11:35,134
You've never wanted to kill anyone?

1107
01:11:35,238 --> 01:11:36,698
Yes, I have.

1108
01:11:36,803 --> 01:11:38,158
I knew it.

1109
01:11:38,262 --> 01:11:41,843
Only I'd worry that the person I wanted to kill would kill me.

1110
01:11:44,277 --> 01:11:46,605
Well, you'd have to make sure you had the advantage.

1111
01:11:50,290 --> 01:11:52,272
What would you like for breakfast?

1112
01:11:52,376 --> 01:11:54,324
I'm not hungry.

1113
01:11:54,428 --> 01:11:55,262
Well, I am.

1114
01:12:01,866 --> 01:12:04,230
How you doing?

1115
01:12:04,334 --> 01:12:05,378
Murray at home?

1116
01:12:05,481 --> 01:12:06,907
I'm sorry, he's out for a meeting.

1117
01:12:07,011 --> 01:12:07,985
Can I help you?

1118
01:12:08,089 --> 01:12:09,479
He left something on his desk for me.

1119
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:10,662
I'll get it myself.

1120
01:12:10,766 --> 01:12:13,164
Hey, excuse me.

1121
01:12:13,268 --> 01:12:14,834
You're not supposed to go back there.

1122
01:12:17,649 --> 01:12:19,005
Where is that little weasel?

1123
01:12:50,744 --> 01:12:53,003
Howard Hansen, 2338 Observatory Lane.

1124
01:13:00,164 --> 01:13:03,362
Would you watch the eggs? I'm gonna wake Howard.

1125
01:13:25,297 --> 01:13:28,114
I'd use my hands.

1126
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:29,434
What?

1127
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,312
That's how I'd kill somebody.

1128
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:33,570
With my hands.

1129
01:13:33,676 --> 01:13:36,699
I'd strangle the bloody life out of them.

1130
01:13:36,804 --> 01:13:38,090
If you had the advantage.

1131
01:13:38,194 --> 01:13:40,349
If I had the advantage.

[suspenseful music]

1133
01:13:52,342 --> 01:13:54,185
Howard, wake up.

1134
01:13:54,290 --> 01:13:55,715
Hurry.

1135
01:13:55,818 --> 01:13:57,731
No, there's no time for that.

1136
01:13:57,835 --> 01:13:59,226
There's always time for that.

1137
01:13:59,330 --> 01:14:02,841
We have got to get out of here.

1138
01:14:02,945 --> 01:14:05,483
Why?

1139
01:14:05,587 --> 01:14:06,282
Why?

1140
01:14:06,388 --> 01:14:07,916
Because we're in danger.

1141
01:14:08,021 --> 01:14:09,794
Danger from what?

1142
01:14:09,899 --> 01:14:11,601
Too much sex?

1143
01:14:11,706 --> 01:14:14,626
Would you forget about that?

1144
01:14:14,731 --> 01:14:16,120
Not likely.

1145
01:14:16,224 --> 01:14:18,450
Howard, we have got to get out of here now while we

1146
01:14:18,553 --> 01:14:21,160
can still think straight.

1147
01:14:21,266 --> 01:14:22,795
Would you listen to me?

1148
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:24,429
Now, I just spent the last 10 minutes

1149
01:14:24,533 --> 01:14:26,966
talking to Carol about different ways to kill people.

1150
01:14:29,817 --> 01:14:32,146
Well, if you're not up for getting a little,

1151
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:34,301
I guess I'll go take a shower.

1152
01:14:34,405 --> 01:14:36,179
What is wrong with you?

1153
01:14:36,283 --> 01:14:39,029
Nothing's wrong with me.

1154
01:14:39,133 --> 01:14:41,567
But I can guess what your problem is.

1155
01:14:41,671 --> 01:14:43,339
You had a good time last night.

1156
01:14:43,444 --> 01:14:47,997
And now you're feeling guilty about it.

1157
01:14:48,103 --> 01:14:49,180
I guess you're right.

1158
01:14:49,284 --> 01:14:51,440
You bet I'm right.

1159
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:00,130
This is insane.

1160
01:15:04,406 --> 01:15:05,276
It's got him too.

1161
01:15:21,231 --> 01:15:22,135
Ugh.

1162
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,282
Here comes Murray.

1163
01:15:30,929 --> 01:15:33,189
Boy is he gonna be surprised.

Murray.

1168
01:15:58,322 --> 01:15:59,365
Huh?

1169
01:15:59,469 --> 01:16:00,930
For Christ's sake, keep it down. CAROL: What?

1170
01:16:01,035 --> 01:16:02,876
Come on, I don't want to make a lot of noise over here.

1171
01:16:02,980 --> 01:16:04,024
Oh, hi, Peg.

1172
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:05,762
Uh, I just dropped in to see Carol.

1173
01:16:05,867 --> 01:16:07,188
Well, here I am.

1174
01:16:07,292 --> 01:16:08,613
Uh, can I see you in private?

1175
01:16:08,717 --> 01:16:10,350
Peg, you don't mind if I, uh-- - Not at all.

1176
01:16:10,455 --> 01:16:12,124
You want some coffee? I got some made.

1177
01:16:12,228 --> 01:16:14,801
Sit down, Peg.

1178
01:16:14,904 --> 01:16:16,921
What-- what the hell is going on here?

1179
01:16:17,026 --> 01:16:18,868
Well, Murray, right at the moment,

1180
01:16:18,972 --> 01:16:21,614
I'm trying to decide whether I want to shoot you

1181
01:16:21,718 --> 01:16:23,456
or cut you in little pieces.

1182
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:24,430
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1183
01:16:24,534 --> 01:16:26,481
If this is a gag, it isn't funny.

1184
01:16:26,585 --> 01:16:27,732
Get in there.

1185
01:16:27,837 --> 01:16:28,670
Now.

1186
01:16:38,856 --> 01:16:40,246
I thought I heard your voice, Murray.

1187
01:16:40,351 --> 01:16:41,603
What are you doing here?

1188
01:16:41,707 --> 01:16:42,993
He came to get one of your old manuscripts.

1189
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,747
What old manuscript?

1190
01:16:46,852 --> 01:16:47,686
"Thunder Over Hawaii."

1191
01:16:50,467 --> 01:16:52,274
What in the hell were you gonna do with that?

1192
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:53,735
Well, you see, I--

1193
01:16:53,839 --> 01:16:55,299
I can't think straight what that gun pointed on me.

1194
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:56,932
Oh, sorry.

1196

Try real hard.

1197

I was gonna sell it.

1198
01:17:02,669 --> 01:17:04,406
- Sell it? - Yeah, man.

1199
01:17:04,511 --> 01:17:05,623
I-- I'm in debt up to my eyeballs.

1200
01:17:05,728 --> 01:17:08,821
I needed the money.

1201
01:17:08,926 --> 01:17:10,143
You could have asked me.

1202
01:17:10,247 --> 01:17:11,602
I would have loaned you the money, Murray.

1203
01:17:11,707 --> 01:17:13,098
You don't have it to loan.

1204
01:17:13,202 --> 01:17:14,245
You're broke.

1205
01:17:18,068 --> 01:17:19,981

How can I be broke, Murray!

1208
01:17:24,222 --> 01:17:25,196
I lose.

Why don't you kill him, Howie?

And who's gonna say any different?
