00:00:55,071 --> 00:01:00,841
.

2
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,879
Richard.

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,686
Sorry.

4
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:49,056
Hello, everyone.

5
00:01:52,428 --> 00:01:53,995
So, how goes
your first day?

6
00:01:54,029 --> 00:01:55,296
Are you meeting people?

7
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,165
One right after the other.

8
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:59,066
I hope there's not
going to be a quiz.

9
00:01:59,101 --> 00:02:01,536
I'm sure it's all
very confusing
at the moment.

10
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:02,937
We couldn't believe
our good fortune

11
00:02:02,971 --> 00:02:04,139
When you agreed
to help us out

12
00:02:04,173 --> 00:02:05,473
At such short notice.

13
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:07,208
Yes, the headmaster's
bottomless well of gratitude

14
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,244
Is all that prevents me
from pointing out

15
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:10,545
That you're not...

16
00:02:10,579 --> 00:02:11,879
(<i>chuckles</i>)

17
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:12,913
Well, when was the last time

18
00:02:12,948 --> 00:02:14,249
That you saw an art teacher
wearing a tie?

19
00:02:14,283 --> 00:02:17,118
Yesterday
at your predecessor's funeral.

20
00:02:19,054 --> 00:02:21,722
Actually, the students do
have a dress code and so do we.

21
00:02:21,757 --> 00:02:22,857
Of course.

22
00:02:22,891 --> 00:02:23,958
(<i>Bell rings</i>)

23
00:02:23,992 --> 00:02:27,828
And there you have it--
the end of the honeymoon.

24
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:34,202
Actually, you know,
I haven't met everyone.

25
00:02:34,236 --> 00:02:37,372
Ah, Cornelia Engelbrecht,
lady of mystery.

26
00:02:37,406 --> 00:02:38,806
Teaches European history.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,942
I wouldn't expect much
from Cornelia.

28
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:44,412
She's not terribly
collegial.

29
00:02:44,446 --> 00:02:46,147
Lives alone
with her father.

30
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:47,882
Does her job.

31
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:12,740
(<i>Door opens</i>)

32
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,913
Ah, miss...

33
00:03:18,947 --> 00:03:20,748
Engelbrecht.

34
00:03:20,782 --> 00:03:22,483
Yes.

35
00:03:22,518 --> 00:03:23,651
Cornelia.

36
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:24,952
Come in.

37
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:46,341
A month into it and you're still
making time to paint.

38
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,176
Such selfishness
is unusual.

39
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:01,456
So, are you going to tell them?

40
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,158
I'm sorry. Tell who?

41
00:04:04,192 --> 00:04:08,396
The ones who have no talent.

42
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,797
16 years old is a little early

43
00:04:09,831 --> 00:04:11,299
To be passing judgment
on talent.

44
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,468
Why?

45
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:14,802
If they possess it

46
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:18,239
They will have demonstrated
the fact by then.

47
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:22,109
Mozart, Picasso.

48
00:04:22,144 --> 00:04:23,544
Why encourage drones?

49
00:04:23,579 --> 00:04:26,013
So you don't believe
in late bloomers.

50
00:04:26,047 --> 00:04:28,283
How long should we wait?

51
00:04:28,317 --> 00:04:32,754
For this particular talent
to bloom, I wonder?

52
00:04:32,788 --> 00:04:36,291
That one might be a while.

53
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:48,503
So

54
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:49,504
What brings you

55
00:04:49,538 --> 00:04:51,872
To our charming
little academic fiefdom?

56
00:04:51,907 --> 00:04:57,445
Drug problems? Alcohol?

57
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,480
Have you run afoul
of the law?

58
00:04:59,515 --> 00:05:01,081
Nothing so dramatic.

59
00:05:01,116 --> 00:05:03,451
Well.

60
00:05:03,485 --> 00:05:05,853
Never mind.

61
00:05:05,887 --> 00:05:14,195
Everyone in a place like this
is hiding from something.

62
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:17,064
For most, it's their own
militant ignorance

63
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,634
Of the subjects
they're paid to teach.

64
00:05:19,668 --> 00:05:23,538
Does that include you, Cornelia?

65
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,247
I wonder if...
I might show you something?

66
00:05:42,157 --> 00:05:44,258
Daddy...

67
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,327
Daddy

68
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:48,329
This is Richard

69
00:05:48,364 --> 00:05:50,264
The new painter
I was telling you about.

70
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,265
Painter?

71
00:05:51,299 --> 00:05:53,768
I'm going to borrow
the key, daddy.

72
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,069
I'll bring it right back.

73
00:05:55,103 --> 00:05:57,071
We talked about this,
daddy, remember?

74
00:05:57,105 --> 00:06:00,408
After supper, we'll
look at it together.

75
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,042
Together?

76
00:06:12,254 --> 00:06:15,456
A series of small
strokes, actually,

77
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:18,058
Each more damaging
than the last.

78
00:06:18,093 --> 00:06:22,530
And you are
the sole caregiver?

79
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:24,432
Well, there's no one
else, is there?

80
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:25,466
Yes, but there's...

81
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,602
Would you mind
standing over there

82
00:06:27,636 --> 00:06:28,636
By the pew?

83
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:37,578
But there are
services, agencies.

84
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:39,881
Yes, but that would mean
someone else in the house

85
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:42,149
Which, I'm afraid,
is out of the question.

86
00:06:42,183 --> 00:06:44,552
Do you mind me asking why?

87
00:06:46,789 --> 00:06:47,955
Because of that.

88
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:01,001
Oh, my.

89
00:07:03,204 --> 00:07:05,205
I knew it.

90
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,008
I knew the first time
I laid eyes on you

91
00:07:08,043 --> 00:07:11,378
That finally
there is someone

92
00:07:11,413 --> 00:07:13,648
Capable of appreciating.

93
00:07:13,682 --> 00:07:16,884
Your predecessor
was a philistine,

94
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:19,320
A <i>complete</i> ignoramus.

95
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:31,265
Look...

96
00:07:33,234 --> 00:07:35,870
Look at her eye...

97
00:07:35,904 --> 00:07:37,204
Like a pearl.

98
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:43,911
The longing in her expression,
the delft light spilling on her.

99
00:07:43,946 --> 00:07:46,647
And look, look, see here?

100
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:49,784
The Grace of her hand,

101
00:07:49,818 --> 00:07:54,722
Idle, palm up.

102
00:07:54,756 --> 00:07:57,124
It's beautiful.

103
00:07:57,158 --> 00:07:59,927
Certainly done in the style
of Vermeer.

104
00:08:02,664 --> 00:08:07,134
It <i>is</i> a Vermeer.

105
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,639
There are so few,

106
00:08:11,673 --> 00:08:13,508
Only 40 canvases in all

107
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:16,377
And most of them
already identified.

108
00:08:16,411 --> 00:08:17,945
Look, Richard, look!

109
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:21,448
Look at the
window glass,

110
00:08:21,483 --> 00:08:22,850
Smooth as
liquid light.

111
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:23,885
And look

112
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,419
Look at the basket.

113
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:27,822
Tiny grooves of brushstrokes

114
00:08:27,856 --> 00:08:31,893
Creating the textures
in the Reed.

115
00:08:31,927 --> 00:08:34,094
That's Vermeer.

116
00:08:34,129 --> 00:08:36,898
It's perfectly
exquisite,

117
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:40,501
But isn't its beauty enough?

118
00:08:40,536 --> 00:08:41,903
What does it matter
if it's authentic?

119
00:08:41,937 --> 00:08:43,738
It's a Vermeer!

120
00:08:46,341 --> 00:08:48,242
If you're right,

121
00:08:48,276 --> 00:08:51,012
Then why isn't it hanging
in a museum?

122
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:52,146
Paintings have histories.

123
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,515
Its previous owners
would have been real people

124
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,516
As real as yourself.

125
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,784
They would have left
a record.

126
00:08:56,818 --> 00:09:00,621
Yes, you're right.

127
00:09:00,656 --> 00:09:01,422
They did.

128
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:13,701
Here they are, Richard,

129
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:15,836
Very real, as you say.

130
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:17,972
Each of them

131
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:19,574
In one brief moment in time

132
00:09:19,608 --> 00:09:25,613
The sole owner of a genuine,
lost Vermeer.

133
00:09:25,647 --> 00:09:29,516
I don't know what to say.

134
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:33,621
Well, it's taken years
of research

135
00:09:33,655 --> 00:09:37,758
And single-minded devotion

136
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:41,195
Tracking this painting down
through the centuries.

137
00:09:41,229 --> 00:09:44,832
It's required nothing less
than a lifetime.

138
00:09:44,866 --> 00:09:49,169
Not a lifetime, a life.

139
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:52,206
Mine, actually.

140
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,542
Not that I regret a moment
of it, you understand.

141
00:09:55,577 --> 00:09:59,013
We've been privileged, too,
my father and I.

142
00:09:59,047 --> 00:10:01,682
Keepers of the flame.

143
00:10:02,784 --> 00:10:07,354
Okay, you have my attention.

144
00:10:07,388 --> 00:10:08,723
Tell me.

145
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:10,758
<i>Very well.</i>

146
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:14,128

00:10:14,162 --> 00:10:16,563
<i>Who in the Autumn of his life</i>

148
00:10:16,598 --> 00:10:20,567
<i>Learned that love could not be</i>
<i>maintained without effort.</i>

149
00:10:27,509 --> 00:10:28,509

Laurens!

152
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,249
Yes, dear.

153
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:36,684
Laurens!

154
00:10:36,718 --> 00:10:38,853
Coming, dear.

155
00:10:38,887 --> 00:10:42,056
Laurens, the day's wasting!

156
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:55,636
Oh, finally.

157
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:56,837
Where did they go?

158
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:59,740
They grew tired
of waiting for you, as did I.

159
00:10:59,775 --> 00:11:03,443
Honestly, husband, you would try
the Patience of a saint.

I don't think little

To marry you.

167

Little dirk
isn't the only one.

168
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,570
Laurens,
don't be that way.

169
00:11:29,604 --> 00:11:31,839
Fritz is a fine young fellow.

170
00:11:31,873 --> 00:11:32,940
Handsome, too.

171
00:11:32,974 --> 00:11:34,641
We must give them
a fine gift.

172
00:11:34,676 --> 00:11:36,777
Something of ours
she's always loved.

173
00:11:36,812 --> 00:11:39,513
Give them a broom
and a butter churn.

174
00:11:39,547 --> 00:11:41,615
He'll take her
away, you know.

175
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:43,984
To Amsterdam,
in all likelihood.

176
00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,054
I could give her my mother's
Opal ring, of course

177
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,424
But that wouldn't be
from both of us to both of them.

178
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:53,527
Look at him with his city shoes.

179
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:57,031
There's nothing wrong
with his shoes.

180
00:11:57,065 --> 00:12:01,335
Nor with good,
solid clogs.

181

183
00:12:05,173 --> 00:12:07,007
Go!

the painting.

00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:14,882
Out of the question.

187
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:19,120
But she's always loved it,
Laurens.

188
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,654
Why are you so ungenerous?

189
00:12:20,688 --> 00:12:24,191
Just think
of something else, Digna.

190
00:12:24,226 --> 00:12:25,860
But why?

191
00:12:25,894 --> 00:12:28,162
It is
the perfect gift.

192
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:29,296
It would be

193
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,832
A touch of our home in theirs.

194
00:12:31,867 --> 00:12:33,433
I'm sorry, Digna.

195
00:12:33,468 --> 00:12:37,838
The truth is I would not
want to be without it.

196
00:12:37,873 --> 00:12:40,407
Why don't you want to give them
the painting?

197
00:12:40,441 --> 00:12:44,044
Is it because
of her, then?

198
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,545
Who?

199
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,948
Oh, Laurens!

200
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,818
Digna!

201
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,454
Digna!

202
00:13:11,506 --> 00:13:14,842
Did you think I didn't know
about her, then?

203
00:13:16,044 --> 00:13:18,879
It is not what you think.

204
00:13:18,914 --> 00:13:21,548
We were very young.

205
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,450
Her name was Tanneke.

206
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:26,053
I do not want to know her name.

207
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:30,691
I do not want to know who
it is you think of every night

208
00:13:30,725 --> 00:13:32,592
When you stop
to look at that painting

209
00:13:32,627 --> 00:13:34,461
Before you come upstairs
to our bed.

210
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:41,468
Joanna:
Papa?

211
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:48,408
There's a chill
in the air.

212
00:13:50,946 --> 00:13:57,384
Remember how you used
to call them wishbone boats?

213
00:13:57,418 --> 00:13:59,419
Are you not happy
for me, papa?

214
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:03,257
Yes. I am.

215
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:07,427
Isn't love absolutely
the most stupendous thing?

216
00:14:07,462 --> 00:14:11,198
I mean, I know
you and mama love each other

217
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,268
But still, I
wasn't prepared.

218
00:14:14,302 --> 00:14:15,469
Prepared?

219
00:14:15,503 --> 00:14:18,405
For the power.

220
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,374
Will it last forever,
do you think?

221
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:23,777
Yes.

222
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:25,779
Yes, it will.

223
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:29,850
Aren't you going to come in?

224
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,789
As soon as I finish my pipe.

225
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,791
All right.

226
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:40,827
Come, dirk.

227
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,897
(<i>Barks</i>)

228
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:49,103
Cornelia:
<i>Perhaps it was</i>
<i>the euphoria of first love</i>

229
00:14:49,137 --> 00:14:51,571
<i>Or maybe it was</i>
<i>simply the painting</i>

230
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:53,607

00:14:56,144 --> 00:14:58,379
Tanneke:
<i>Oh, Laurens.</i>

232
00:14:58,413 --> 00:15:01,515
Is it not the most
glorious day ever?

233
00:15:01,549 --> 00:15:03,150
No. It's the worst.

234
00:15:03,184 --> 00:15:05,786
The Sky is full
of thunderheads.

235
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,323
It'll rain and rain
and we will all drown.

00:15:09,357 --> 00:15:11,525
Melodramatic boy.

237
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,893
Must you go tomorrow?

238
00:15:12,928 --> 00:15:14,494
My aunt has fallen seriously ill

239
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,196
And there's no one
to care for her.

240
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:17,197
What about me?

241
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,198
Will I not be

242
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:19,533
Sick at heart
until your return?

243
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:20,534
No.

244
00:15:20,568 --> 00:15:22,269
Why will you not marry me?

245
00:15:22,304 --> 00:15:25,005
I didn't say I
wouldn't marry you.

246
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,674
I said I'd consider
marrying you.

247
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,344
Which means you're also
considering not marrying me.

248
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:32,313
Yes, that, too.

249
00:15:32,347 --> 00:15:36,016
I know we've not known
each other very long

250
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:37,952
But, Tanneke

251
00:15:37,986 --> 00:15:39,886
Surely you must see
how much I love you

252
00:15:39,921 --> 00:15:41,355
And what's more,
you love me.

253
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,159
Don't pretend you don't
because I know you do.

254
00:15:45,193 --> 00:15:47,962
Isn't that the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?

255
00:15:47,996 --> 00:15:50,364
No.

256
00:15:50,398 --> 00:15:51,832
Do you see how patiently

257
00:15:51,866 --> 00:15:53,033
She waits for him?

258
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:54,234
For him?

259
00:15:54,269 --> 00:15:55,502
For her lover.

260
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:58,605
She loves him and maybe
one day they will marry.

261
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,875
Well, I hope she
doesn't wait <i>too</i> long.

Won't you never
let it down?

Perhaps, one day.

Um... Will
you come

Of course.

Yes, yes, yes.

more kissing

for breaking your promise

Why don't we live inland?

350
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:43,697
Because land
is expensive

351
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:48,435
And because the farm
your father inherited is here.

352
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:04,050
It's bad.

353
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,420
The drainage mills
can't begin their work

Until the sea dike is repaired

355
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,790

be ruined by then.

The baby took milk
five times today.

00:25:17,765 --> 00:25:21,368
What kind of mother would
leave an Infant in a flood?

and saw no way out.

What's this?

363
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,049
It was stuck
at the back of the painting.

364
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:39,018
It's the work
of a man from delft

365
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,722
And... There's a message

00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:56,737
We've been given
a sacred trust, Stijn.

369
00:25:56,771 --> 00:25:59,539
And the means to fulfill it.

370
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:01,408
Take the painting to Groningen.

371
00:26:01,442 --> 00:26:03,143
See what you can get for it.

372
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:06,112
We'll be needing
the money soon.

373
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:07,648
Saskia.

374
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:12,952
Sell the painting.

375
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,241
Man:
<i>Where did you get this?</i>

376
00:26:35,276 --> 00:26:36,876
Saskia:
<i>It was given to me.</i>

377
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:47,454
Do you know who
Johannes Vermeer is?

378
00:26:47,488 --> 00:26:48,555
No, sir.

379
00:27:01,101 --> 00:27:04,103
24 gilders.

380
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:16,650
They offered
only three gilders.

381
00:27:16,684 --> 00:27:20,119
Three gilders.

382
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:29,429
Meat and cheese could be
purchased for three gilders.

383
00:27:29,464 --> 00:27:32,799
The man who did the painting's
name was Vermeer.

384
00:27:32,834 --> 00:27:35,101
Johannes Vermeer.

385
00:27:35,135 --> 00:27:37,170
He's famous, Stijn.

386
00:27:37,204 --> 00:27:41,641
And yet you were only offered
three gilders.

387
00:27:43,911 --> 00:27:46,446
Just as well, then.

388
00:27:46,481 --> 00:27:50,984
If he's famous,
it'll fetch more in Amsterdam.

389
00:27:51,018 --> 00:27:54,988
Don't be long
about it.

390
00:27:55,022 --> 00:27:57,624
How many more potatoes?

391
00:27:57,658 --> 00:28:00,627
Almost a barrel.

392
00:28:00,661 --> 00:28:04,030
Leave the seed potatoes, Saskia.

393
00:28:04,064 --> 00:28:07,901
I know, Stijn.

394
00:28:12,573 --> 00:28:17,277
Are you certain
we can't keep it, Stijn?

395
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:19,946
Yes.

396
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:22,516
And so are you.

397
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:30,857
It's just that there's
so little beauty in this life.

398
00:28:33,895 --> 00:28:36,863
I'm sorry I don't
grow tulips, Saskia.

399
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:39,733
I'm sorry we're not
more prosperous.

400
00:28:39,767 --> 00:28:42,636
I am a potato farmer...

401
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,904
Like my father before me

402
00:28:43,938 --> 00:28:47,741
And his father
before him.

403
00:28:47,775 --> 00:28:51,711
And you are
a potato farmer's wife.

404
00:29:52,239 --> 00:29:54,007
(<i>Cow moos</i>)

405
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:57,644
Papa said not to touch
the seed potatoes.

406
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,016
(<i>Cow moos</i>)

407
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:05,184
These are the eating potatoes.

408

(<i>Mooing</i>)

409
00:30:16,463 --> 00:30:17,697
Set the table, Marta.

410
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,699
Papa will be
home soon

411
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,235
And we don't want him
to be cross with us.

412
00:30:36,116 --> 00:30:39,385
Meat?

413
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,287
I sold the spice chest.

414
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:45,491
Not the painting.

415
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:52,532
No.

416
00:30:52,567 --> 00:30:55,535
Well, there's some
good news, at least.

417
00:30:55,570 --> 00:30:58,304
The sea dike is repaired.

418
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,808
Tomorrow the drainage mills
will start up again

419
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:04,410
And next week the
water board will allow

420
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,380
Each landowner one day
free of dike work.

421
00:31:09,283 --> 00:31:11,051
Will our land come back, papa?

422
00:31:11,085 --> 00:31:13,887
(<i>Chuckles</i>)

423
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:15,521
It never went anywhere, Piet.

424
00:31:15,556 --> 00:31:18,257
It's still there
down under all the water.

425
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,060
Before long you'll be
playing and running

426
00:31:20,094 --> 00:31:22,361
All over the farm just
like you used to, son.

(<i>Mooing</i>)

428
00:32:33,934 --> 00:32:36,435
I'll be in the barn, then.

No! No!

432
00:33:15,876 --> 00:33:17,510
How could you?

433
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:29,189
How could you?

434
00:33:29,223 --> 00:33:31,624
Every farm wife knows

435
00:33:31,658 --> 00:33:35,929
You never touch
the seed potatoes.

436
00:33:35,963 --> 00:33:39,065
There's only a
quarter barrel left.

437
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:42,635
Not enough to seed
more than a few rows.

438
00:33:42,669 --> 00:33:45,205
We are ruined, Saskia.

439
00:33:45,239 --> 00:33:48,174
A man's seed potatoes
are his future.

440
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:51,077
They were us.

441
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:53,579
This family.

442
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:58,317
Nothing more?

443

Stijn...

444
00:34:01,455 --> 00:34:06,760
We're nothing more
than seed potatoes?

445
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,395
That's all God wants for us?

446
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:12,331
Work and more work?

447
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:14,467
Row upon row
of potatoes?

(<i>Sobbing</i>)

449
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:20,606
I need more, Stijn.

450
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:24,744
We need more.

(<i>Sobbing</i>)

452
00:34:37,591 --> 00:34:42,528
Tomorrow, I'll take the children
to Westerbork.

453
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:46,332
They can stay
with my mother and father

454
00:34:46,366 --> 00:34:52,005
While I go to Amsterdam.

455
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:58,544
Then we will have money
for... Seed potatoes.

Father:
"the king rides
through the water.

457

The king rides
through the stars."

458
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,388
Now what do you
think of that?

459
00:35:13,093 --> 00:35:15,195
I don't think I've ever
beheld a painting

460
00:35:15,229 --> 00:35:16,595
Quite so beautiful.

461
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,965
I call it <i>Morningshine.</i>

462
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:21,234
Yes.

463
00:35:21,268 --> 00:35:25,138
Yes, I see.

464
00:35:25,172 --> 00:35:28,674
But the seed
potatoes, Saskia.

465
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:30,343
You know better.

466
00:35:30,377 --> 00:35:34,747
Yes, I know.

467
00:35:34,781 --> 00:35:40,453
But may we stay for a while
until he gets over it?

468
00:35:40,487 --> 00:35:42,822
It's so lovely here.

469
00:35:48,528 --> 00:35:49,662
No.

470
00:35:49,696 --> 00:35:53,032
No, tomorrow you
go to Amsterdam

471
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:56,535
Where you will sell this
most beautiful painting.

472
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,372
You can return for
the children afterward.

473
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:06,112
And there's something else
you should do.

474
00:36:06,146 --> 00:36:07,613
You should get down

475
00:36:07,647 --> 00:36:09,015
On your knees and thank the Lord

476
00:36:09,049 --> 00:36:11,450
You have a man
as hardworking as your Stijn.

477
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:25,564
I'm not sure he... Finds me
beautiful anymore.

478
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:29,335
Before the children
he used to...

479
00:36:32,572 --> 00:36:36,809
Now he works
until he's exhausted...

480
00:36:36,843 --> 00:36:43,082
Until sometimes, when he's done,
there's nothing left.

481
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,685
Have we taught you nothing,
daughter?

482
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,854
Such work is love made plain

483
00:36:48,889 --> 00:36:53,659
And you're a fool
if you don't recognize that.

484
00:36:53,693 --> 00:36:58,864
The child's the blessing,
not the painting.

485
00:37:07,574 --> 00:37:11,710
Stunning. Magnificent.

486
00:37:11,745 --> 00:37:15,781
Look at the window glass...
Smooth as liquid light.

488
00:37:17,751 --> 00:37:22,388
Tiny grooves of brushstrokes
to show its texture.

Good morning,

560

What time is it?

561
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:42,114
Oh, you've slept away most
of the morning, dear boy.

562
00:41:42,148 --> 00:41:45,183
Is that why you left the
university, then, hmm?

563
00:41:45,218 --> 00:41:47,653
You were tossed
out for laziness?

564
00:41:47,687 --> 00:41:50,088
I left of my own volition, aunt.

565
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:51,356
As you well know.

566
00:41:51,391 --> 00:41:53,559
Well, if that's
your story...

567
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:57,396
I don't suppose you've seen
an insolent servant girl

568
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:59,665
Who's nearly as lazy
as you are

have you?

570
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:05,103
I saw one such yesterday
afternoon in the stocks.

571
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:06,238
Yes, the same.

572
00:42:06,272 --> 00:42:09,074
I'll have her bring you
something to eat

573
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:12,645
If I can resist the temptation
to skin her alive

574
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:14,246
When I find her.

575
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,948
Aletta?

576
00:42:17,083 --> 00:42:20,185
What was the poor
girl pilloried for?

577
00:42:20,219 --> 00:42:21,954
"Poor girl,"
indeed!

578
00:42:21,988 --> 00:42:25,157
She nearly frightened
your uncle to death.

579
00:42:25,191 --> 00:42:27,225
In the middle of the night

580
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,828
She hid outside
his bedroom window

581
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:35,300
Caused the curtains to move
and made moaning sounds.

582
00:42:35,334 --> 00:42:40,172
Convinced Herbert that
his bedroom was haunted

583
00:42:40,206 --> 00:42:43,442
By the spirits
of dead Africans.

584
00:42:43,476 --> 00:42:46,445
He shipped for the dark
continent yesterday

585
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:47,980
Full of terrors

586
00:42:48,014 --> 00:42:51,083
And believing that
that girl had cursed him.

587
00:42:51,117 --> 00:42:53,786
Well, I hardly think a servant
can be held responsible

588
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,754
For a slaver's
guilty conscience, aunt.

589
00:42:55,789 --> 00:42:57,823
Your uncle is a
legitimate trader.

590
00:42:57,857 --> 00:43:00,492
Yeah, and we

<i>he trades in.</i>

591

And human souls.

Profitable ventures, all

594
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:05,798
From the look of things,
dear aunt.

595
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:09,001
You weren't tossed
out of the university

596
00:43:09,035 --> 00:43:11,570
For laziness,
but for insolence.

597
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:12,871
Aletta?

598
00:43:32,191 --> 00:43:34,292
Hello again.

599
00:43:38,865 --> 00:43:41,399
And now your kiss has
been returned, witch.

(<i>Rattling rumble</i>)

601
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,635
Master de koonig?

602
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:18,170
I have arrived.

603

So I see.

604
00:44:19,338 --> 00:44:21,373
And who <i>are</i> you?

605
00:44:21,407 --> 00:44:25,410
Adrian Kuypers, from the
university in Groningen.

606
00:44:25,444 --> 00:44:27,546
Ah, you are the young man
who is tired

607
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,847
Of Dusty old books

608
00:44:28,882 --> 00:44:31,083
And the wisdom
of ancient philosophers.

609
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:33,752
I believe that science
can master nature

610
00:44:33,787 --> 00:44:35,620
For the benefit of mankind.

611
00:44:35,655 --> 00:44:39,758
Well, <i>there's</i> your science,
Adrian Kuypers.

612
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:42,561

Connected to the screw

614
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:47,166
And 28 staves
connected to the shaft

615
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,735
Is all that keeps
our land above water.

616
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:53,739
But master, if the head
were made of 56 staves

617
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:57,076
Would it not displace water
twice as fast?

618
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,777
Excellent idea.

619
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:00,112
Except it would require

620
00:45:00,146 --> 00:45:02,347
Twice the wind power
to turn the screw.

621
00:45:02,381 --> 00:45:05,317
In any case,
what you're witnessing

622
00:45:05,351 --> 00:45:09,154
Is merely one element
of nature controlling another.

623
00:45:09,189 --> 00:45:11,556
You and I don't
control anything.

624
00:45:11,591 --> 00:45:14,392
We are inconsequential
grains of sand.

625

I saw a stork here
last week.

629
00:45:41,988 --> 00:45:44,723
Storks are good luck,
you know.

630
00:45:44,758 --> 00:45:48,227
If one nests on your roof,
it means you'll be rich.

631

And if it eats out of your hand,

They're all
one big machine

Perfectly synchronized
for the good of everyone.

When the waterwolf wants
to come over the dikes, he will.

There's no such thing
as a waterwolf, Aletta.

Maybe.

644
00:46:24,497 --> 00:46:26,765
Anyway, their belief
that I am

Is the only protection
I have against them.

646
00:46:30,069 --> 00:46:33,471
Yes, and they'll
grow up irrational

647

Thinking storks
bring good luck.

he's very foolish

915

Spending money
on paint and canvas

916

and so many mouths to feed.

When he drops his trousers
in the convent courtyard?

When he goes on one of
his drunken rampages?

out of jail, Maria?

It's a remarkable painting,

And a remarkable story.

1009
01:22:23,020 --> 01:22:25,422
But?

1010
01:22:25,456 --> 01:22:29,225
You make a compelling case,
though I don't have to tell you

1011
01:22:29,260 --> 01:22:32,396
That much of it rests on
speculation, conjecture,

1012
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:34,865
And that's not even
taking into account

1013

The real problem,
which is the gap.

You know what I'm talking
about, don't you, Cornelia?

1015
01:22:40,104 --> 01:22:43,172
Because even if we concede
the accuracy of your history

1016
01:22:43,207 --> 01:22:45,208
It leaves out the
one thing necessary

1017

To establish provenance.

1018
01:22:46,611 --> 01:22:48,578
It doesn't explain
how that painting

Comes to be here
in this room.

You think I haven't anticipated
this question?

both feared and longed

There lived a family
who owned pigeons.

1028

They were against the law,
of course, pigeons.

Isn't that
the most astonishing thing--

1030

That a bird should be
against the law?

1031

01:26:35,439 --> 01:26:36,740
(<i>Whispers</i>):
Good.

1091
01:27:10,641 --> 01:27:11,641
(<i>Gasps</i>)

1092
01:27:41,305 --> 01:27:44,307
(<i>cooing</i>)

1093
01:27:53,584 --> 01:27:55,585
(<i>snapping</i>)

1094
01:28:01,092 --> 01:28:03,026
(<i>cooing</i>)

1095
01:28:06,931 --> 01:28:08,965
(<i>snapping</i>)

1096
01:28:19,910 --> 01:28:21,978
(<i>snapping</i>)

1097
01:29:22,606 --> 01:29:24,707
That's enough now.

1098
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:26,810
They're clean.

1099
01:29:31,748 --> 01:29:32,816
(<i>Door opens</i>)

1100
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:34,117
Who can this be?

1101
01:29:34,151 --> 01:29:35,351
Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.

1102
01:29:35,385 --> 01:29:36,519
In the room...
You...

1103
01:29:36,553 --> 01:29:39,322
(<i>clanging</i>)

1104
01:29:39,356 --> 01:29:41,157
This way.
Put them in here.

1105
01:29:44,929 --> 01:29:47,197
I'll go check
upstairs.

1106
01:29:47,231 --> 01:29:49,265
(<i>Door closes</i>)

1107
01:29:58,843 --> 01:30:01,044
(<i>indistinct shouting</i>)

1108
01:30:22,933 --> 01:30:25,335
Pigeons everywhere.

1109
01:30:43,287 --> 01:30:45,188
Keep moving.

1110
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:55,164
(<i>Hand taps</i>)

1111
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:59,468
Is this possible, then?

1112
01:30:59,503 --> 01:31:01,704
The delft light?

1113
01:31:03,573 --> 01:31:07,643
Lion-head finials on the chairs.

1114
01:31:09,280 --> 01:31:11,247
And...

1115
01:31:11,282 --> 01:31:14,650
The tapestry on the table.

1116
01:31:16,520 --> 01:31:18,854
All Vermeer.

1117
01:31:33,103 --> 01:31:35,571
You may come out now.

1118
01:31:38,675 --> 01:31:41,844
Do you hear me, little boy?

1119
01:31:49,353 --> 01:31:52,155
So...

1120
01:31:52,189 --> 01:31:55,024
Do you miss your pigeons?

1121
01:32:03,800 --> 01:32:05,335
Would you like

1122
01:32:05,369 --> 01:32:07,803
To come along with me?

1123
01:32:22,019 --> 01:32:24,988
What happened
to the boy?

1124
01:32:25,022 --> 01:32:27,823
My father...

1125
01:32:27,858 --> 01:32:29,993
Took him to the trains,

1126
01:32:30,027 --> 01:32:32,661
And the trains took him
to the camps.

1127
01:32:38,568 --> 01:32:43,039
Do you know what
he's ashamed of-- my father?

1128
01:32:43,073 --> 01:32:47,076
If not that,
then I can't imagine.

1129
01:32:48,912 --> 01:32:52,515
That he never Rose higher
in the ranks.

1130
01:33:19,543 --> 01:33:21,610
You could give it up, you know

1131
01:33:21,645 --> 01:33:23,846
Put it in a museum.

1132
01:33:25,249 --> 01:33:28,084
He's my father.

1133
01:33:34,691 --> 01:33:37,527
Well, good-bye, Cornelia.

1134
01:33:38,895 --> 01:33:40,729
I see I was wrong about you.

1135
01:33:40,764 --> 01:33:43,732
Hmm.

1136
01:33:43,767 --> 01:33:45,734
You call yourself an artist?

1137
01:33:45,769 --> 01:33:47,336
You're just as blinded

1138
01:33:47,371 --> 01:33:49,939
By conventional morality
as the rest.

1139
01:33:49,973 --> 01:33:53,309
"Conventional morality"?

1140
01:33:53,343 --> 01:33:57,613
Yes, I suppose that I am.

1141
01:33:57,647 --> 01:33:59,715
You have no right
to judge us.

1142
01:33:59,749 --> 01:34:01,750
We saved that painting,
my father and I.

1143
01:34:01,785 --> 01:34:03,852
We'd have given our lives
for it, gladly.

1144
01:34:03,887 --> 01:34:05,488
We <i>have</i> given our lives for it.

1145
01:34:05,522 --> 01:34:07,590
Do you know
what such devotion is called?

1146
01:34:07,624 --> 01:34:08,791
Such sacrifice?

1147
01:34:08,825 --> 01:34:10,126
Well, I'll tell you.

1148
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:11,694
It's called love.

1149
01:34:11,728 --> 01:34:13,729
Richard!

1150
01:34:25,442 --> 01:34:28,010
(<i>Panting</i>)

1151
01:35:17,394 --> 01:35:20,229
(<i>sobbing</i>)

1152
01:36:31,785 --> 01:36:33,786
(<i>door closes</i>)

1153
01:36:35,755 --> 01:36:38,490
It's not one
of their better faculty houses

1154
01:36:38,525 --> 01:36:40,492
But it would give you
a studio.

1155
01:36:40,527 --> 01:36:43,462
Oh, thanks, Adam.
I think I'll pass.

1156
01:36:43,496 --> 01:36:45,031
Suit yourself.

1157
01:36:45,065 --> 01:36:47,834
Does feel haunted, I admit.

1158
01:36:47,868 --> 01:36:49,268
Imagine, packing up

1159
01:36:49,303 --> 01:36:51,637
And leaving
in the middle of the night.

1160
01:36:51,671 --> 01:36:53,973
Not a word to anyone.

1161
01:36:56,977 --> 01:37:00,579
And you're saying
that she had a Vermeer?

1162
01:37:01,581 --> 01:37:03,950
Right.

1163
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:06,385
Should we call the authorities?

1164
01:37:06,419 --> 01:37:08,287
They should be punished.

1165
01:37:08,322 --> 01:37:11,824
No, their lives are punishment
enough, I should think.

1166
01:37:11,859 --> 01:37:14,493
What about
the painting?

1167
01:37:14,527 --> 01:37:16,428
Oh...

1168
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:19,298
I wouldn't worry too much
about the painting.

1169
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:22,101
It's inspired
several of its previous owners

1170
01:37:22,135 --> 01:37:23,469
To finally let it go.

1171
01:37:23,503 --> 01:37:26,372
I don't think Cornelia
will be any different.

1172
01:37:26,406 --> 01:37:30,176
So, you <i>really</i> think
it's authentic?

1173
01:37:30,210 --> 01:37:31,911
Well, I can't
be sure

1174
01:37:31,945 --> 01:37:34,713
But I think it is, yeah.

1175
01:37:42,322 --> 01:37:44,123
So...

1176
01:37:44,157 --> 01:37:47,093
It's still out there, then.

1177
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:49,495
Somewhere.

1178
01:37:49,529 --> 01:37:52,564
A Vermeer
that nobody knows about.

1179
01:37:59,839 --> 01:38:03,242
I just can't seem
to get it out of my mind.

1180
01:38:06,846 --> 01:38:09,548
And I don't think I want to.

1181
01:40:37,006 --> 01:40:38,548
---The end---
