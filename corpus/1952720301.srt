1
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,119
Your hands are beautiful.
You play the piano?

2
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:10,239
Not really.

3
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,039
Mind if I join you?

4
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,679
Allan.

5
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,639
Jane.

6
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,199
The way you're tapping the
table you should play the piano.

7
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,559
Do you live here?

8
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,559
Born here.
Raised here.

9
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,279
Stuck here.

10
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,319
Well I'm just passing though.
Want another?

11
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:41,102
Okay.

12
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,039
Well. I'm in insurance
I insure farm machinery.

13
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,679
You have beautiful eyes, Jane.

14
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,079
I'm trying to think of an interesting
question about farm machinery.

15
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,839
There aren't any, trust me.

16
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,319
- No?
- No.

17
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,399
- So what are we gonna talk about?
- You.

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,799
You're interesting.
I can tell.

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,759
So, what brings you to this bar?

20
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,839
I live around here.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,319
Nothing on TV
Monday night.

22
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,119
Tell me, Jane, what do
you do in life?

23
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,319
Apart from being
disappointed by TV.

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,159
Not to much..

25
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,479
What is it, some kind
of secret?

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,519
It's not a secret.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,839
What?
You must do something.

28
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,039
I am a singer.

29
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,439
I wasn't far off with
my piano question.

30
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,079
The night is young, we're
just getting started.

31
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,039
How about a game of pool?

32
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,399
Alright, if you do not mind losing.

33
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,879
We'll see about that.

34
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,119
I didn't realize how late it is.
I gotta get home.

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,919
Something wrong?

36
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,839
No, I'm just afraid I
gotta be somewhere.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,879
Thanks for the beer.

38
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,572
I remember pickin' a wild orange

39
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,599
at the edge of the woods
surrounding our house.

40
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,399
I threw the orange right at the stars,
and it never fell back.

41
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,599
I held that fruit for
a second.

42
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,159
Today, I look at the orange tree through
the window of a dark train... and...

43
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:58,239
Seems like it is
painted on the glass.

44
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,839
Are you sure?

45
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,199
It was a crisis.

46
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,359
If I were an angel

47
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,079
I wouldn't let things
like that happen.

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,119
- Alright.
- See you tomorrow, Mike.

49
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:30,639
- Alright.
- Get up, Joey.

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,119
Get up.

51
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,999
Want a ride home?

52
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,559
No.

53
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,479
I'll walk.

54
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,279
Be careful who you bother
with your bullshit.

55
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,679
It's not... it's not... it's not bullshit.

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,119
I knew you'd still be awake.

57
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,319
You tore your shirt.

58
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,879
I know.

59
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,319
I don't want to share like talking tonight.

60
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,719
I've got something
I want to show you.

61
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,679
I found this.

62
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,039
Ever listen to it?

63
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,359
Why don't you go home, Joey?

64
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,675
We've got big plans for tomorrow, right?

65
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,759
Good night.

66
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,919
You have a bathing suit underneath?

67
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,159
Many too many people are here!

68
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,719
Now that's a fashion statement.

69
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:35,959
You look like some dorky
superhero.

70
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,931
And I'll make you
my sidekick.

71
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,679
- Show me what you've got.
- I don't feel like it.

72
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,559
- Come on wheels!
- No!

73
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,439
Come on!
Do not be shy.

74
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,785
They told me you are
very sexy on the stage.

75
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,599
Forget it.
Give me my candy back.

76
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,399
Put on your suit. Want some candy...

77
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,879
Put your suit on.

78
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,739
Suit on.

79
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,394
Red suit.

80
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,079
Oh come on, I want to feel the water.

81
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,288
I bet it's not even that cold.

82
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,119
Could you feel?

83
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,079
Okay!
Let's go out, let's get out. Be careful.

84
00:08:05,148 --> 00:08:06,974
Hurry... Be careful!

85
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,999
Shit, Joey!

86
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,963
- It was on purpose.
- Okay.

87
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:21,559
Joey, I'm fine.
Calm down. Come on come on.

88
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,839
Stop it.
Nobody died.

89
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,499
Nobody died, there's no crisis.
Stop, okay?

90
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:40,079
I gotta tell you something.

91
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,439
I saw an ad...
in the paper yesterday.

92
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,959
And guess who's givin' a special talk
in New Orleans next week?

93
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,479
Who?

94
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,239
Jeff Noffray.

95
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,279
Who is Jeff Noffray?

96
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,519
You're jokin' right?

97
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,079
- Who is it?
- Jeff Noffray?

98
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,519
It's not ringing any bells.

99
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:22,559
"Join Jeff Noffray,
on September 26,

100
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,319
for a special discussion
on his latest book:

101
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,639
"I to talk to angels and to ghosts. "

102
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,759
"Free your soul from the fall.
Angels are a creation of God... "

103
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,999
"All you have heard is true...

104
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,739
- Allow them to speak to you. "
- Okay, I get it.

105
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,019
I got... I gotta be there.

106
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,319
I have read all his books.
I lent one to you.

107
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,399
Didn't you even look at it?

108
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,759
You know how I feel about
all that crap Joey.

109
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,879
Yeah, but didn't you even look at it?

110
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,399
I mean, didn't you even
look at it?

111
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,159
Because if you looked it,
you'll know it is not crap, Jane.

112
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,699
When I met you at
the hospital, you were in bad shape

113
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:08,339
And I listened to you talk about your
angels, crap, and your dumb ghosts

114
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,899
because I knew that you needed to

115
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,879
But shit, Joey,
it's been seven years!

116
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,039
You need to get over it now.

117
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,870
- Don't lecture me.
- I'm not lecturing you, Joey.

118
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:22,739
- It's just the truth.
- Do you think I'm crazy?

119
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,979
- Just look at yourself.
- What about me?

120
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,599
If I didn't come and get you up everyday,
you'd just stay in bed until you die.

121
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,119
Oh shut up, Joey.
You know anything.

122
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,479
- You hide from the world because...
- Shut up.

123
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,959
...you have two wheels instead of legs.
- Shut up, Joey!

124
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:43,359
- You don't sing anymore... Shut up!
You're barely alive.

125
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,339
All you do is sleep.

126
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:49,919
At least I don't talk to the air
like some crazy freak!

127
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,761
- I'm not crazy.
- You can't talk to ghosts, Joey.

128
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,859
- Yes I can.
- No you can't!

129
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,119
- Yes I can!
- No you can't!

130
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,239
Yes I can!

131
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,919
- Can you believe her?
- Oh great.

132
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,439
- Can you believe her?
- Don't just... I know... stop it

133
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,479
- I know! I know!
- Stop it!

134
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,599
No... she called me
a crazy freak.

135
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,459
I do not know, I'm
not in my body right now.

136
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,319
Is there something wrong man?

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,097
I don't understand.
What are you talking about?

138
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,119
- Of course, of course you're being mean!
- Quit it!

139
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:44,479
Can... can I sleep on your
couch tonight, Jane?

140
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,119
I just don't want to
be alone tonight.

141
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,519
Yes

142
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,319
You know that they give out
citations for unsightly yards...

143
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,439
I hate to have to report you.

144
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,399
Asshole.

145
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,879
Joey!

146
00:13:05,427 --> 00:13:07,559
- Joey?
- Ms. Wyatt?

147
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,519
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been? We had no idea where you were.

148
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,799
- It's your buddy...
- What?

149
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,139
He tore your house up, then he
ran out in the street

150
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,479
and threatened my wife.

151
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,599
And the cops came, and
they tackled him

152
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,959
and he's screaming at everybody about a fire
somewhere. Ranting, like a mad man.

153
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,759
- They took him away?
- Like an animal, straight to hospital.

154
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,459
My wife is still in
shock. He pulled her hair.

155
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,839
Can you drive me there?

156
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,439
Can you not find your room?

157
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,839
Do I look sick?

158
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,199
You bastard!

159
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,719
You son of a bitch!
I broke all my dishes!

160
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,059
This smashed up my whole house!

161
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:54,959
Whatta you think, I'm just loaded and I can just buy
all new stuff every time you freak out?

162
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,659
Well I don't give a shit if you hear voices!
You can't just wreck my house!

163
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,959
Do not touch me!

164
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,439
- Doctor!
- Let me ask you something, Joey...

165
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,359
Who's gonna fix it, Joey?!

166
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,479
- Madam, this is a hospital.
- I know that!

167
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,079
He trashed up my home!

168
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,639
- Calm down.
- You broke everything I had, Joey!

169
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,979
You're going to disturb every
patient on this floor! Stop it!

170
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,159
Jane or Mommy Jane...

171
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:07,119
I'm ten, and my communion
is on September 27th.

172
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,519
I would like to invite you
and talk to you,

173
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,159
because I'm a man now,
or will be so soon.

174
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,559
I hope I'll see you soon
and will be able to tell you how I'm doing at school

175
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,919
and show you my
science report.

176
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,839
My new mom and dad agree that
we should see each other again

177
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,759
but they told me that
you might not want to.

178
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,679
So, I do not know if you'll
be there on the day 27th

179
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,919
at 1345 Bleek Street,
Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

180
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,267
Hey

181
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,719
What are you doing here?

182
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,679
I cleaned everything up.

183
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,619
So what?
You want a big "thank you" parade?

184
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,359
Go home, Joey.

185
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,479
- I can't.
- Yeah you can, Joey. Go home.

186
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,619
I can't.

187
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,279
Yes, you can! First street on the right
after you leave my house.

188
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,079
Now get out of here!

189
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,359
Calm down.

190
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,039
- He's here. Go get him! Lock him up!
- Calm down.

191
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,799
Good morning, ma'am. I'm Dr. Clark,
Marshall County psychiatric hospital.

192
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,379
This guy is dangerous!

193
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,299
- We don't have time for introductions.
- Calm down!

194
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:58,359
- Mam, do you know a Joey Navinsky?
- Yes

195
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,159
Well he escaped from the hospital last night and your
neighbor said he saw him coming into your house.

196
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:07,019
I know I won't need to tell you that
harboring a fugitive is a violation of the law.

197
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:10,839
Look, look officer, this intervention is first
and foremost medical so...

198
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,519
Your patient is clearly dangerous
to himself and others

199
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,759
- He comitted an assult and it is my duty to make sure that...
- Well he's not here so...

200
00:18:17,794 --> 00:18:22,039
well, you see, the thing is Mr. Navinsky
is still on probation.

201
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,719
And he could go to jail this time.
He needs treatment.

202
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,864
Well he came by last night,
and he left.

203
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,178
Well she's lying!

204
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:33,385
Now I won't stand for this! My
wife is still scared to come out of the house!

205
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,079
- Just calm down, alright?
- Well do something! - Last time, calm down.

206
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,439
Now mam, this is serious.
Now if you see him,

207
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,679
I want you to call me.
Do you understand?

208
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,859
- I will call. Understood officer.
- Alright, thank you, ma'am. That's it.

209
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,226
Joey?

210
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:15,039
Joey, get out of there.

211
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,039
- I ain't going back to the hospital.
- They're talking about jail.

212
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,039
I can't take those pills cramed
down my throat.

213
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,519
I ain't going to get no
needles in my arm.

214
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:44,316
And I ain't gonna be sedated.

215
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,439
anymore.

216
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,799
I need to come with
me to New Orleans.

217
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,379
I need to know if
the only one to hear these voices.

218
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,652
- Jeff Noffray can help me.
- No.

219
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,500
Please. Jane...

220
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,199
You're the only one
that cares about me.

221
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,519
Please!

222
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,416
Please.

223
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,839
Whatta you bringing
the guitar for?

224
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,119
I might get inspired to write
a song, you never know.

225
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,999
- What for?
- Why not?

226
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,319
Take off your hat.

227
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,559
And those stupid sun glasses.

228
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,599
Born leader, Jane.

229
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,959
- Hey. Is that smoke?
- It's nothing.

230
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,759
Well I don't think it's nothing Joey.

231
00:22:09,601 --> 00:22:11,839
It's overheating.
It happens sometimes.

232
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,506
- I got it.
- Joey...

233
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,859
...I think I'm wanna get out.

234
00:22:20,052 --> 00:22:22,199
- Joey.
- It's nothin', It's nothin', It's nothin'.

235
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,539
I do.
I wannta get out, Joey.

236
00:22:26,571 --> 00:22:27,975
Joey?

237
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,319
- Joey, I wanna get out!
- Okay. Okay.

238
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:35,329
Well, let's go.

239
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,511
Oh!
It's my wheelchair!

240
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:48,079
My wheelchair... and our bags and guitar!
Hurry!

241
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,079
Hurry up, Joey.

242
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:53,539
- Shit! Hurry Joey.
- I'll save you, I'll save you.

243
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,959
Be careful.
Really fast Joey. Hurry.

244
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,839
Hurry.

245
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,499
Get hit by a missile?

246
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,399
Idiot.

247
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,019
Well I am back.

248
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,599
Promised ya.
Promised ya I'd find one.

249
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,089
Here it is.

250
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,479
- Whose car is it?
- A friend.

251
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,159
It's a nice Christian's car.

252
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,039
It's green.

253
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:01,159
- Is it reliable?
- As, you know, reliable as Jesus Christ.

254
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,479
It's got new tires...

255
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,759
and plenty of space here.

256
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,239
- It's green?
- What next?

257
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,719
Listen to this.

258
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,299
Runs like a charm.

259
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,619
It's only $600.

260
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,279
Five.

261
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,279
It's green.

262
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,319
Yeah. So?

263
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,199
It's ugly. That's what.

264
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:35,439
500.
If you take me to St. Louis.

265
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,839
52 degrees in St. Louis

266
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,439
55 in Cape Girardeau,
48 in Springfield

267
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,439
45 in Columbia, Missouri.

268
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,759
Who is it?

269
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,199
Hello, I was...

270
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:12,119
I was sitting in my
room and was wondering...

271
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,299
If you need...
you know... uh...

272
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,739
Do you want me to give you
a shower or something?

273
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,039
I mean, if you need one.

274
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,119
- Or a bubble bath?
- That's fine.

275
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,699
"I can ask you something?

276
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,039
Do you feel anything?

277
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,079
I mean...

278
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,659
You know what I mean.

279
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,388
What do you mean?

280
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,799
I want us to have a good time? You know.
Just a... let's screw just for the fun of it.

281
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:46,099
You know, everybody need
to have their tank filled.

282
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,759
I'm tired, Dean.

283
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,479
You do not have to do much.
Just a little.

284
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,919
It's up to you, Jane.

285
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,919
How afraid are you?

286
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,479
Dean. Just go.

287
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,279
You know what, Jane?

288
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,479
For a long time I... uh

289
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,039
I don't feel anything inside here.

290
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,599
I mean I can walk, but...

291
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,079
I think I'm crippled too.

292
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,199
Is it possible to break this glass?
Put your arm through window

293
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,639
Feel the air and the speed on your skin.

294
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:19,079
Being able to talk with you is the
most precious thing.

295
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,919
We're all in this together.

296
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:29,199
All on the same train.
Alone and isolated.

297
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,359
one day I'm gonna break this glass.

298
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,119
One day I will break it.
I'll watch in shatter in pieces,

299
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:45,199
making stars of the night sky.

300
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,879
I will.

301
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,199
I will.

302
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:27,978
- Where's our ride?
- It was there.

303
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,179
It was there.

304
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,159
What's it say?

305
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,599
"Have this one.
I filled the tank. Dean. "

306
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,339
Excuse me?

307
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,799
Excuse me. I lost my ring.
Do you see it over there?

308
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:06,999
Excuse me, I lost my ring. Do you see...
It fell?

309
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,599
I was playing with it,
and it fell.

310
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,219
I have to find my ring.

311
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,779
Is this it?

312
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,439
Here it is. It was right in front of my
eyes and didn't even see it.

313
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,079
You're my hero!

314
00:29:34,152 --> 00:29:37,399
- Joey.
- Billie.

315
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,478
Have a seat, Joey.

316
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,239
So, where are you headed?

317
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,559
New Orleans.
Then Baton Rouge.

318
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:55,959
I've been traveling with Jane.
She's a singer.

319
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,259
We travel together
but we are not... together.

320
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:04,139
I mean, we are together,
but we're just friends.

321
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:07,999
She's pretty.
You on tour?

322
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,999
In a way.

323
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,679
And you?

324
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,359
My husband disappeared.

325
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,785
He was there, and then one evening,
disappeared. No one.

326
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,799
It's been a month, and...

327
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,079
I haven't heard anything from him.

328
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,239
No calls.

329
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:35,079
I've got one minute left on
this stupid phone for him, but...

330
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,699
no ring yet.

331
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,559
I went to the warehouse where he worked,

332
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,319
and they said they haven't
had any news either, and that...

333
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,439
If he didn't show
up in a week...

334
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,299
hire a new man.

335
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,999
I don't know where he's at.

336
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,759
I don't think he went
to the Moon

337
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,159
Don't worry.

338
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,519
I saw the angel wings on your back.

339
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,379
It's a sign.

340
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,119
I did that myself.

341
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,279
I like angels.

342
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,639
Sorry.
Sorry!

343
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,479
It's alright. I won't break.

344
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,519
I don't think.

345
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,579
Here we go.

346
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,568
Now, I'd like to
propose a toast.

347
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,919
As you know, Dale, Chris,
Suzie and I have recently won first place

348
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,479
in the state's fireworks competition.

349
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,259
Yes! Yes!
Thank you.

350
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:04,559
Okay, which means, that
we are very happy to be able to say to

351
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,539
Jake here this evening, that the
entire $5000 prize

352
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,239
will go to his charity to
help soldiers' families.

353
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,279
But, to tell you the truth

354
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,226
the toast that I'd like to propose
this evening, is not to us

355
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,199
Why not? Toast us!
We deserve it.

356
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:29,199
The toast that I'd like to propose tonight,
is to my little sister, Billie.

357
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,459
I know times have been hard,
but take heart,

358
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,079
You'll always have a home
here with me.

359
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,599
And welcome, Joey and Jane.

360
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,319
Cheers. Cheers.

361
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:55,039
Jane, did I hear you're a singer...?

362
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,159
I used to be in a band,
but that was a long time ago. A long time ago.

363
00:33:01,592 --> 00:33:06,739
Jane. Jane she has a gig
in a few days in Baton Rouge.

364
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,919
Really?

365
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,010
- Baton Rouge?
- In a club?

366
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,359
No, I definitely don't have a gig.

367
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:18,199
But if she did have a gig,
it would be great!

368
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,719
- I bet you would.
- And what do you do Joey?

369
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,979
- I am Jane's bodyguard.
- Really?

370
00:33:27,668 --> 00:33:29,170
No!

371
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,239
- I'm a fireman, I mean I'm an ex
fireman, I used to be a fireman. - Seriously?

372
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,279
Yes, I fought fires.

373
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,259
That's exactly what we need on here
for our surprise tonight.

374
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,139
- Norah!
- What?

375
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,839
- Wait. What a surprise?
- Curiosity killed the cat.

376
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:50,519
- But the satisfaction brought him back?
- It's a surprise.

377
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,419
Said so, but I think you're gonna have to wait
like everyone else.

378
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,459
You'll like it, believe me.

379
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,039
I'm gonna walk
for a bit.

380
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,259
Uh... do you wanna
come with me?

381
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,299
Come on,
I'll show you the well.

382
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,619
Some French wine?

383
00:34:06,796 --> 00:34:09,032
- This way.
- Okay.

384
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,394
Jane?

385
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,799
Sure, thank you.

386
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,079
Not very deep.

387
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,239
It's a wishing well.

388
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,679
My father had it made to amuse
us when we were little.

389
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,039
I used to come out here when
I really wanted something.

390
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,519
I like close my eyes

391
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,599
and make my wish.

392
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,379
Really,

393
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,399
I don't know where my
husband could have disappeared to.

394
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,479
You should come with us to New Orleans.

395
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,679
There's a guy.

396
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,799
A specialist in talking to ghosts.

397
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,799
You can get them to find
your husband. He can help you.

398
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,799
I know he can. I know.

399
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,149
Thank you, Joey.

400
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,859
Guess we're all missing something.

401
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,879
Let's make a real wish.

402
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,279
- Do you got any...
- Oh, yeah.

403
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,439
Oh, that was loud!

404
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,799
Okay, everybody get up and
very calmly go over by the swing

405
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,599
Dale and Suzie to behind the scenes

406
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,119
Take your drink

407
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,839
"I can I drive you?
The ground is a little muddy.

408
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,799
I don't know,
you got a license for that?

409
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,779
Oh, I can drive a tractor
It hard can this be?

410
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,599
I'm in good hands.

411
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,739
Who's excited?

412
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,199
Alright alright, it's just
a little surprise. Not much.

413
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,159
- You ready?
- Ready.

414
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,419
Alright, I've gotta get going, but the lady for
the bus will be here in just a few minutes.

415
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,679
It was very nice for you
to drive us this far.

416
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,119
I happy for the company.

417
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,959
Tell my sister I'll be okay, and
the fireworks were amazing.

418
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:57,159
- Apple pie?
- Thank you.

419
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,519
Oh, and the check please.

420
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:02,879
My purse.

421
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:05,359
I must have left my
purse in the car!

422
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,819
Here's your check.

423
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,279
I did.
I left my purse in the car.

424
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,779
Too late.

425
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:23,391
$ 37.

426
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,806
I don't have anything.

427
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,559
$ 16.
I'm broke.

428
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:37,199
The bus is here.

429
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,879
Sorry.

430
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,999
I have a plan.

431
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,559
I've done this before.

432
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,119
The key is, separate.
That's the basis of this whole operation.

433
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,759
Billie, you're gonna go to the
bathroom, and you're gonna wait.

434
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:03,799
I'm gonna get the bags and the guitar,
and I'm gonna go out of the restaurant, first...

435
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,199
What do I
wait for in the bathroom?

436
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,439
Wait.

437
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:11,319
Because I'm gonna go out
calmly to the bus.

438
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,839
I'm gonna get on
and stay on.

439
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:16,279
But somebody's got to stay here, right here,
til the very last moment.

440
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,919
They won't suspect anything

441
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:23,439
because Billie, you come out of the bathroom
and go straight out of the restaurant.

442
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,398
Jane, you'r gonna see me get
on the bus, and you're gonna count

443
00:40:29,223 --> 00:40:34,954
...to 30. And then, you're gonna
come out and join us

444
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:37,999
like nothing ever happened.
Okay?

445
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:40,279
Let's go for it!

446
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,919
It is assumed that
I get up first?

447
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,999
Yes, he was supposed to
take the bags too.

448
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,959
- What do we do?
- Take the bags and go.

449
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,239
Discreetly.

450
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,959
Sorry.

451
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,079
Sorry.

452
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,239
Let me give you a hand, ma'am.

453
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,439
Where do you need to go?

454
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,679
The bus.

455
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:38,039
You know, my sister is in a wheelchair
but she never lets me push her.

456
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,159
It's leaving.

457
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,599
- Stop!
- Let me handle this.

458
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,679
Stop the bus, in the name of the law!
Hang on tight.

459
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,999
Stop the bus!

460
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,379
- I've always wanted to do this.
- No problem.

461
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:56,547
- Here you go.
- When you stole the car,

462
00:41:56,628 --> 00:42:01,719
- did you get to check the engine?
- I don't think so. I didn't have enough time

463
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,759
When? When did you have
time to check the engine?

464
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,599
- Did you change the oil?
- Don't blame me.

465
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,479
- Well that's not the point anyway!
- Well what really is the point?

466
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,639
Hey hey. You get out without paying any money
then you start bawling each other out!

467
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,739
Get out of my bus. Now!

468
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,879
The point is, I was almost was arrested.

469
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,899
But you weren't and we're all okay.

470
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,019
No, thanks to him.

471
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,099
It would have worked if
you guys just had of done it right.

472
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:39,419
What? You screwed up. And now
we're all stranded here in the middle of

473
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,199
God knows where!

474
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,919
We're in Cairo.

475
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,319
Well guess what?
I don't want to be in Cairo.

476
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,679
I didn't even want to come
on this stupid trip.

477
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,199
Well, you're gonna thank
me for this later.

478
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:56,239
Thank you? Asshole!
Thank you for what? For what?

479
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,599
We're all up shit creek!

480
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,499
We're on this trip for
you too, believe me.

481
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,579
Shut up, Joey!

482
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,079
I don't want to hear another one of your theories
about how I need to find myself

483
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:09,859
by the grace of whatever.
Stupid angels hanging over my head.

484
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:13,059
I'm done! I'm done Joey.
I quit.

485
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:18,939
- You've gotta start living again, Jane.
- Stop trying to rescue me!

486
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,839
And you gotta go see your son.

487
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,499
What?

488
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:50,219
I found this letter that
he sent you.

489
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,439
It is an invitation to
his communion party.

490
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,239
In Baton Rouge.

491
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:05,199
If I had of told you, you never would
have gotten in the car in the first place.

492
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,819
Read this.

493
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,509
I don't want to.

494
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,879
It is true that your father
died in a car accident?

495
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,559
He died when I was 3.

496
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,199
And your first mother...

497
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:55,879
did she die with
your first father?

498
00:44:56,133 --> 00:45:00,599
- No.
- Then why do you have a new mother?

499
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:06,039
Because the first one is sick, and she couldn't
take care of me after the car accident.

500
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,639
- Why?
- she was in a coma.

501
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,299
What's that?

502
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,959
It's worse than being asleep.

503
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:18,079
And when you wake up,
your brain's changed, and

504
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:20,379
you can't give love anymore.

505
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:27,039
A week later, they told me
I'd never walk again.

506
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,239
His mom helped our a lot,
when she was alive.

507
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,879
When she passed away, I just...

508
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,159
...I guess I went crazy.

509
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,999
The state put Devon
in Foster Care.

510
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,399
Seven years now.

511
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:46,639
He's inviting you.
It's time to start over again.

512
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,319
I don't have a job, and

513
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,759
I got no money,
I don't have a nice home.

514
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,479
I wouldn't even know
what to say to him.

515
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,859
Joey says you're
gonna sing him a song.

516
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:04,799
No, that's not gonna happen.

517
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,319
Do you know Joey a long time?

518
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,759
Since the accident,
when they put me in the psych ward.

519
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,659
What was he doing in
the psych ward?

520
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:29,199
There was a fire, in the subdivsion
where Joey's family lived, and

521
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,279
He saw his parents, and his sister
and his little niece die.

522
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,279
His ghosts are
his angels, or whatever...

523
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,499
It's them that
he talks to.

524
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:51,079
Do you hear music over there?

525
00:46:51,723 --> 00:46:53,128
Yeah.

526
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:58,279
If there is music, I'll
bet there'll be food.

527
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,039
We're stranded, and
we heard your guitar.

528
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:49,999
I'm Billie and,
this is Jane and Joey.

529
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,439
Come in.

530
00:47:57,960 --> 00:47:59,679
He sent ya.

531
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:03,639
You know who sent us?

532
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:08,199
He sent ya. He sent ya and
you don't even know it

533
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,879
He heard the guitar
that's why he sent ya.

534
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,159
Who?

535
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,219
You know all about Clarksdale?

536
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:23,679
Why Robert Johnson
met with the devil.

537
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:26,479
Robert Johnson?

538
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,479
He was a traveler, like you.

539
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:34,719
Stranded, lost,

540
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,799
a night like tonight.

541
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:41,199
It was 1932

542
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:45,439
and young Robert had
been walking for hours

543
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,979
with his guitar on his back,
and he was lost.

544
00:48:51,480 --> 00:48:53,639
and as far as he could see

545
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,779
and saw trees
lining the road

546
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,759
that were black as coal.

547
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:04,579
That's when he seen,
the cross.

548
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:12,599
Not knowing what direction to go,

549
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:17,919
he decided to spend the night
where the 4 roads met.

550
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:28,199
As he was starting
to fall asleep,

551
00:49:28,360 --> 00:49:32,599
the birds of the night went quiet
and a fresh breeze woke him.

552
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:37,839
he looked up and a dark shadow
appeared in the night sky

553
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:40,539
cloaked in a black cape,
and a large hat.

554
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,639
a human like form
descended upon him.

555
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:47,039
The creature reached across Robert
grabbing his guitar,

556
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,359
and with long thin,
terrifying fingers

557
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,879
tuned it to a sound that
never been imagined before

558
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,479
and dropped it
by Robert's side.

559
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:01,559
Now Robert Johnson had
just signed a pact

560
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:06,559
that would make him the most
extraordinary blues man that ever lived

561
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:11,439
all he had to do,
was trade his precious soul.

562
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,699
- I really like this cake.
- Yeah.

563
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,079
I'm still hungry.

564
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,399
I gotta tell ya, there's something
special about this cake.

565
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:39,479
It can make you may feel
happy, or sad.

566
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:44,079
Or it can make you
feel huge, or tiny.

567
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:01,839
My father used to say
that every spot in the world

568
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:04,399
has it's own particular vibration.

569
00:51:05,780 --> 00:51:09,039
This was my grandparent's garden.

570
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:12,999
And hundreds of years
before them,

571
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:17,359
it was the garden of the
Choctaw and Quapaw tribes.

572
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,499
this was one of
the world's gardens.

573
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:28,679
the garden where you can dream.

574
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,159
In the Bible, it's
called the Garden of Eden

575
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:41,899
which in Hebrew means,
the Garden of Pleasure.

576
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:47,799
We can understand the world
if we look at it from here.

577
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:58,199
We are all innocent
in this garden.

578
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:04,879
We can be reborn here
every evening.

579
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,679
Mom...

580
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:14,479
Mom..

581
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,179
I don't know how to live with that.
The things that I've lost.

582
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,459
I know.

583
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:43,719
But I would just like to
be able to walk again.

584
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:59,679
What are you doing?
Got a couple Screws loose?

585
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,599
Just a couple.

586
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:04,239
Hey, I've got a proposal for you.

587
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,559
Coming from the guy who changes
his license plates soon as he wakes up...?

588
00:53:07,866 --> 00:53:10,959
Come on, thats... you know, it's nothing.
Straight up.

589
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,479
Are we leavin'?

590
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,399
Caldwell wants to get you
in a little moretrouble first.

591
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:18,999
No... no. I've got a gig,
it's way south of here, and I

592
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:21,219
got this singer,
and she can't make it.

593
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:24,119
So if I show up alone
I lose a gig.

594
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,999
So I want her to sing.

595
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,045
Come on. It's just two songs.
We'll split fifty to fifty.

596
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:33,119
Then I'll drive you guys the rest of
the way to New Orleans.

597
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:36,299
That sounds like a great plan.

598
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:58,039
I'll drop you off here because
I've got some business to do.

599
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,359
but the Rose Inn Hotel is right up the street,
and I'll meet you there at 9 o'clock sharp.

600
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:06,059
Just two songs.

601
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:11,699
You're gonna be amazing.
Did you decide what song you're gonna do?

602
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:14,639
- I can't wait to hear you.
- I'm not going to do it.

603
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,919
- You can do it.
- I can't.

604
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:19,199
Yes you can.

605
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,239
You're super wheels, remember
You can do anything.

606
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,119
Do you want me to break out
cape would ya?

607
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,719
I not gonna do it just because
you've decided that I should,

608
00:54:29,823 --> 00:54:32,039
- okay?
- Where you going?

609
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:35,199
Leave me alone.
I'm not a child!

610
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,939
"Jane or Mommy Jane,
I've ten years and my communion...

611

613
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,519
and will be able to tell you how I'm doing
and show you my science reporft... "

614
00:55:59,120 --> 00:56:02,459
- Got a cigarette?
- No.

615
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,519
Got a smile?

616
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,319
Just a smile.

617
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,359
I'm Carol.
My husband, Jim.

618
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:26,559
And Bush, the dog.

619
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,559
- You from around here?
- No, no... I'm traveling.

620
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,459
Us too.

621
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:39,339
We're headed for Iowa
You want to come along?

622
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,879
I had that flower
in the palm of my hand.

623
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:45,119
You seem sad.

624
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,399
The petals and and the glass
were mixed together.

625
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,335
- Play her a song.
- A song?

626
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,779
Oh, I've got a song for you.

627
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,359
I don't play this...
for just anybody.

628
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,919
Should I believe,
or should I disappear.

629
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:18,999
Damn!
I trusted you, son of a bitch!

630
00:59:19,060 --> 00:59:21,119
The deal was for you
and a singer.

631
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,599
And now it's you, alone,
and an hour late.

632
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,579
I'm gonna play.

633
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:28,679
Do you think people give a shit
about you and your guitar?

634
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:30,579
- Dick head!
- Faggot.

635
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:33,559
I'm the only one who
still hires you anywhere around these parts

636
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,499
and you... you pull this crap.

637
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,519
- Go find it for me.
- Joey, get down.

638
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,399
- Go find it for me.
- Who's he?

639
00:59:42,536 --> 00:59:44,519
- Go find it for me.
- He's alright

640
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,768
Come on, get down... please,
we're in the kitchen.

641
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:50,219
- Go find it for me. Great!
- What's he wacked out on?

642
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:55,367
- This is who you show up with?
- Joey, Joey... what'd he say?

643
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,819
They said that they we're
gonna bring her back, right here.

644
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:01,611
She's on her way.

645
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,959
Ladies and Gentlemen,

646
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:12,399
while waiting for the angels
to hear our request

647
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,879
and answer our prayers,

648
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:18,279
a little guitar
won't hurt you.

649
01:00:42,088 --> 01:00:43,678
Now.

650
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:27,959
Thanks.

651
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:32,319
Tonight we have a
real special treat

652
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,119
for the Rose Inn Hotel,

653
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:38,779
a great singer...
Jane Wyatt.

654
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,679
Sorry I'm late,
I was in the park.

655
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,959
had a lot on my mind.

656
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:10,919
I met Jim and Carol,
they're on their way to Iowa.

657
01:02:13,040 --> 01:02:16,860
Carol is dying and they're taking
one last trip to say goodbye to their friends

658
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,399
and to each other.

659
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:24,579
They don't travel, behind windows
on buses or trains.

660
01:02:28,040 --> 01:02:30,919
Nothing is painted
the glass for them.

661
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:41,759
This is for them...

662
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,999
...and anybody who's

663
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:50,059
who's trying to make their way.

664
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:33,559
Oh... you sang right to the
heart, just like a bird.

665
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:35,719
An out of practice
unrehearsed bird.

666
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,399
Ah, they come in all
shapes and sizes.

667
01:06:38,560 --> 01:06:42,499
Whoever heard of a bird,
that has lost it's voice?

668
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,479
We must be getting close.

669
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,539
- You said you're from New Orleans,?
- Yep

670
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,579
Where were you when
the storm hit?

671
01:07:07,360 --> 01:07:12,247
You've got to be kidding!
Joey. Joey!

672
01:07:12,280 --> 01:07:16,199
- What?
- That car. Right there. It's him!

673
01:07:16,360 --> 01:07:17,931
- Yes, it's him.
- It's him!

674
01:07:17,966 --> 01:07:20,639
- What's happening?
- Yes, that's our car.

675
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:23,879
- Slow down, what the hell going on?
- He stole our car!

676
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,679
Oh, can you believe?

677
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:31,759
- He's getting away, he's getting away!
- don't miss it.

678
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:36,092
He's gettin' away!
He's gettin' away!

679
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:42,479
- Give us back our car!
- Give us back our car right now!

680
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:46,879
You gotta stop him.

681
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:52,436
- Come on, come on Police!
Police! Police!

682
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:56,014
don't utter that word in this car!

683
01:07:56,080 --> 01:07:58,639
- You can cut him off here.
- I'm trying.

684
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:05,479
- Do something.
- Get your hands off the wheel.

685
01:08:05,552 --> 01:08:06,639
- Joey!
- don't miss it.

686
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,519
- I'm trying.
- You're losing him... you're losing him.

687
01:08:09,600 --> 01:08:12,499
- My God, we're all gonna die.
- That's our car!

688
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,877
I don't care!

689
01:08:13,912 --> 01:08:17,479
Open the glove box.
Open it.

690
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:24,039
- What are you doing?
- He's got a gun!

691
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,119
I don't know Caldwell,
just stop!

692
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:29,319
- Drop the gun!
- Take the wheel.

693
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:31,359
- No!
- Take the wheel!

694
01:08:32,360 --> 01:08:35,999
- Stop!
- I'm was just shootin' at his.

695
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,579
Stop!

696
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:39,759
Come on.
Be serious.

697
01:08:47,440 --> 01:08:49,319
We're going down!

698
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:14,299
- Shit!
- Alright, I picked you up hitchhiking.

699
01:09:14,360 --> 01:09:16,979
- What?
- You were hitchhiking. I picked you up.

700
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,159
Get out of the car!
Hands on your head! Get out of the car!

701
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,639
Hands on your head.
Hands on your head.

702
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,199
Get in the car now.
Get in the car now!

703
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:32,799
I can't move my legs!

704
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,719
- Get out of the car!
- I can't move my legs!

705
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:36,519
Put your hands behind your back!

706
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:43,159
- We need an ambulance!
- Don't take me to the hospital, did you hear me!

707
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,359
Alright, calm down.

708
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,919
- I'm gonna die!
- Nobody is going to die.

709
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:49,239
- The ambulance is on it's way.
- Shut up!

710
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:53,479
- Up against the car. Help her up against the car.
- I'm paralyzed!

711
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:57,759
- I won't go to a hospital...
- Next to the car!

712
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:03,159
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Put them in the car.

713
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,839
Nothing is clear in our world.

714
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:19,599
Nothing happens the way
we expect it to.

715
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,279
Caldwell was a musician
and barman.

716
01:10:24,440 --> 01:10:27,879
After the levees failed,
he lost everything.

717
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,839
His house, his job,
his way.

718
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:33,599
His whole life went under water.

719
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:36,559
He found other
ways to survive.

720
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:41,359
The police typed out his crimes
on a sheet of paper.

721
01:10:41,520 --> 01:10:44,839
They noted that he had saved
his neighbors during the flood

722
01:10:44,960 --> 01:10:47,399
but there are no excuses.

723
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:51,079
The reasons come in
all shapes and sizes.

724
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,599
Cells aren't the best places
to spend the night right now.

725
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:09,439
Gather your things
and make it quick.

726
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:11,359
But what about our testimony?

727
01:11:11,520 --> 01:11:14,099
We have your statement,
You're better off not asking questions.

728
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,279
And New Orleans has enough vagrants already,

729
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:21,079
I suggest you move along...

730
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,359
Your friend is in San Patricks
Hospital. They say he'll pull through.

731
01:11:28,420 --> 01:11:30,626
- Can we see him?
- No, no.

732
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,919
He's headed back to prison
as soon as he's out of danger.

733
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:36,959
Will you give him this?

734
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:41,819
I can't.

735
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:44,019
It's just a song.

736
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,439
Caldwell,

737
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:50,119
Do you know the black oropendola,
or the goldfinch

738
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,079
Tengmalm's owl that
lives in a forest of spruces

739
01:11:54,520 --> 01:12:00,319
you ever heard of the zebra finch
or seen a blue cervert hummingbird?

740
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:04,399
Look at this one.
It lives along the rivers.

741
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:08,039
It fishes at dusk
when it's shadows disappears.

742
01:12:10,800 --> 01:12:13,839
Did you know that the scarlet ibis'
color comes from the shrimp it eats?

743
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:15,399
Isn't that funny?

744
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,519
Look at this one...
a green and ruthless kingfisher.

745
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:25,959
It's songs like two
stones knocking together.

746
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:30,639
Some say they've heard it
sing differently.

747
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,639
Nobody looks at it much anymore,
but the house sparrow...

748
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:41,079
it doesn't migrate,
it stays in it's neighborhood

749
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,879
and eats at the local restaurant.

750
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:47,479
This is the little
wing sova

751
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:50,119
they say that it's song is sad.

752
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:53,959
On the ground, it runs so fast that
it's legs become invisible.

753
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,799
Whatta you think of that?

754
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:03,799
It's Jeff Noffray!
He's here. He's here.

755
01:13:05,200 --> 01:13:07,599
Excuse me, Sorry,
excuse me, sorry.

756
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,079
Mr. Noffray! Mr. Noffray!

757
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:18,759
It's such an honor.

758
01:13:19,060 --> 01:13:20,439
You are... uh...

759
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:25,999
...a magician, really.
- Good to meet you.

760
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:30,639
I can see, you have the
angel aura about you.

761
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,039
You all do.
I'll see you inside.

762
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:37,899
Before the talk you've all been
waiting begins...

763
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:39,279
we've got a little surprise for you.

764
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,079
now, they've been rehearsing
for two weeks now.

765
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,079
So sit back, and get ready
to dream a little.

766
01:13:45,220 --> 01:13:47,039
Let's give it up,
for the students

767
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:49,399
of the San Bernardo School

768
01:13:55,880 --> 01:13:57,959
I'm gonna miss this.

769
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:00,199
I've got to go to the bathroom.

770
01:14:01,840 --> 01:14:05,529
You can see God's hand
on their little faces.

771
01:14:07,480 --> 01:14:10,679
You can not tell me angels
do not exist. Can I get an "Amen"

772
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:12,439
Amen! there are angels.

773
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,279
I'm fed up with this crap! Do you hear me?
You really pissed me off.

774
01:14:22,440 --> 01:14:24,599
Not so loud

775
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:29,639
Look at me. Am I, or am I not, a bestselling author?
I write the books don't I? Answer me!

776
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:32,312
Look. As your manager, I have to
say, a lecture is a lecture.

777
01:14:32,347 --> 01:14:33,845
Have you seen this place?

778
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,439
I'm Jeff Noffray. I'm not
one of your crummy beginners

779
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,959
I've been a major
reference for thirty years!

780
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,979
You told me this would be a nice venue.
Look around, we're in a rathole.

781
01:14:50,140 --> 01:14:51,419
They're your readers!

782
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:55,899
My readers are white. They come
to hear me in five star hotels.

783
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,919
- Have you seen this crowd?
- Calm down.

784
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:02,079
A bunch of Black and Mexican retards.
Who knows what diseases we're catching,

785
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:05,599
exposed to these third world losers
dumb enough to think angels exist!

786
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:10,559
- Help!
- What are you doing? Let him go!

787
01:15:10,720 --> 01:15:12,279
You need to know what he
said about you!

788
01:15:12,580 --> 01:15:16,219
Hey man. Just let the man go, please!
Help!

789
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:17,919
What are you doing?
What's going on?

790
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,479
Help!

791
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:22,879
- Joey? No!
- So you really think I'm a retard huh?

792
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:25,730
Joey, let him go!

793
01:15:26,440 --> 01:15:27,939
- You're a liar!
- Stop!

794
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,659
- We came from Kansas City to see you!
- The guy's crazy.

795
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:35,679
- and you're a racist, and you're a liar!
- Hey get back in here!

796
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,039
Look. Look at them.

797
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,839
I can't see anything.

798
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,019
Right there.

799
01:16:14,360 --> 01:16:19,319
There is nothing there, Joey.
Or maybe there is, but...

800
01:16:19,640 --> 01:16:22,899
I don't want to think things
exist that I can't see.

801
01:16:23,960 --> 01:16:28,279
It's not encouraging.
It's depressing.

802
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,639
They're there.
They all are.

803
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,499
But if you're the only
that can see them...

804
01:16:37,560 --> 01:16:41,279
You can't share them,
And if you can't share them...

805
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,619
they'll miss the point?

806
01:16:54,400 --> 01:16:58,779
You don't need angels
or ghosts or magic...

807
01:16:59,560 --> 01:17:02,419
the sharing is what's extraordinary.

808
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:17,999
Let's just... share the moon

809
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:34,119
Now boarding
Amtrac train number 345,

810
01:17:34,180 --> 01:17:37,319
for Baton Rouge,
on track two.

811
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,519
I'm starving.

812
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,199
Uh, there is a vending machine back there.
I can go get you something.

813
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:47,519
- We don't have time.
- Just a second. I'll be back.

814
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:50,919
Where is it?

815
01:17:53,592 --> 01:17:57,545
Hello?
Hello?

816
01:18:00,388 --> 01:18:04,359
I'm a... I'm at a train station.
Are you okay?

817
01:18:06,120 --> 01:18:09,299
I know. I know.

818
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,907
I never thought that.
No.

819
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:20,779
Okay, I'll do it.

820
01:18:21,781 --> 01:18:24,457
Okay. Yes

821
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,799
Wait, don't hang up!
Say something... to me.

822
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:33,759
It's him.

823
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,419
Plain or peanuts?

824
01:18:47,080 --> 01:18:48,779
What... what happened?

825
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:51,739
Her husband's back.

826
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:03,679
He called me just like that,
on a train station platform.

827
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,437
I'm ready to go.

828
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:29,239
- You have everything?
- Got your wish.

829
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:31,839
Now you gotta go to him.

830
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:35,899
You better go.

831
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,139
I don't know what to say.

832
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:46,359
You want plain,
or you want peanuts?

833
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:48,619
Plain.

834
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:53,219
Thanks... for everything.

835
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:01,088
Take care of yourself, okay?

836
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,179
I have half the Moon!

837
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:33,719
I'm still looking at this tree,
through the window.

838
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,339
What I see through
the window is real.

839
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:48,079
I guess someone is alone
as they think.

840
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:56,519
I... am... walking.

841
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:01,359
angels and magic
aren't important, Jane.

842
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,479
Yet you have to share
what actually exists.

843
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:09,319
Is that what you say, Joey?

844
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:13,799
Somebody whispered that
in my ear.

845
01:21:15,080 --> 01:21:17,399
Maybe we'll see her
again sometime.

846
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,639
We all do what we can to
feel a little of this wind on our skin.

847
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:28,599
A breath, pushing in the warmth,
that makes the journey sweeter.

848
01:21:34,360 --> 01:21:38,039
How many people can
you meet in one life?

849
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:43,177
How many trains must you take,
before you find yourself again?

850
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:48,559
I don't know if I believe in God.

851
01:21:50,820 --> 01:21:54,359
Why would I believe in
anything other than myself?

852
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:59,199
Why would I believe in
anthing other than my neighbor?

853
01:22:10,840 --> 01:22:14,839
Mama, will I ever walk again?

854
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:33,692
I... am... walking.

855
01:22:36,035 --> 01:22:38,458
I am walking.

856
01:22:39,870 --> 01:22:42,372
I am walking.

857
01:22:47,681 --> 01:22:50,069
I am walking...!

858
01:23:11,526 --> 01:23:15,359
Devon!
Devon, come over here honey.

859
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:19,182
Devon, come see. Your Uncle Joseph
has something for you.

860
01:23:19,832 --> 01:23:22,799
- Tell him to come over here.
- It's not important, let him play.

861
01:23:22,913 --> 01:23:26,439
Devon! Devon.
Want another gift?

862
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:30,159
- I'm coming.
- I knew that would get his attention.

863
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,359
- What is it?
- No no, you shouldn't ask what it is.

864
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,959
Let him be.

865
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:44,439
I was given this pen at my own
communion, long time ago.

866
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:46,599
I've had my initials changed.

867
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:50,439
See? It has your initial now.
It is only for writing important things.

868
01:23:50,920 --> 01:23:53,379
That's very lovely.
Take good care of it.

869
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,680
Yes

870
01:23:56,480 --> 01:23:58,361
- Will you hold it for me please?
- Sure.

871
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:02,119
Hey Devon, stay close,
we're leaving in five minutes.

872
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,959
Are you waiting for someone?

873
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:18,279
No.

874
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:25,759
You know if letters sometimes
get lost in the mail?

875
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,879
I have no idea.

876
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:33,119
Let's go, Devon.

877
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,079
Hey.. here's the big man!

878
01:24:36,240 --> 01:24:38,359
Alright, say thank you to grandpa
for organizing everything.

879
01:24:38,420 --> 01:24:40,142
- Thank you Grandpa.
- What a good boy.

880
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:41,939
Say goodbye to everyone.

881
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,399
- Thank you so much.
- My pleasure.

882
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,139
- We'll talk to you later.
- Bye.

883
01:24:56,280 --> 01:24:57,759
Can you see him?

884
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,907
There's a dozen kids in there.

885
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:03,879
dark blond hair.

886
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:09,159
Let's just go inside.

887
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,879
I don't know if I can, Joey.

888
01:25:12,600 --> 01:25:14,939
Yes you can,
because you're invited.

889
01:25:15,760 --> 01:25:17,539
I want to leave.

890
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:23,839
- There is a platform... and it's got a piano on it.
- So?

891
01:25:24,480 --> 01:25:27,319
So, we'll just go in,
and play your song.

892
01:25:27,480 --> 01:25:30,159
No, this isn't the right time.
That would feel right at all.

893
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:34,479
- It would be a great surprise.
- Are we coming back later?

894
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,479
No, honey.
We're sleeping over at Aunt Nancy's.

895
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,099
Say goodbye to Mimi?
No.

896
01:25:40,240 --> 01:25:44,519
It was wonderful.
You know, I cried all though the ceremony.

897
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,099
I cried too.

898
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:48,519
You know he's a man now.
I know.

899
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:51,979
Alright honey, go get in the car.
I'll be there in a sec.

900
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:55,919
- I'm not letting you leave, Jane.
- It's not up to you.

901
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,659
What are you doing?

902
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:11,659
I can't even tell which
one is Devon.

903
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:17,559
Go in.
Sing.

904
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:22,159
He'll know who you are.

905
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:39,199
I'm scared

906
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,519
The evening wind are still

907
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:07,239
I lost the way and will

908
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:11,319
Can't tell you where they went

909
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,099
I just know what they meant

910
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:19,219
I'm always on my guard

911
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:24,002
Admitting life is hard

912
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,079
without you near me

913
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,719
- Devon!
- The friend you used to be

914
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:38,159
So near and dear to me

915
01:28:38,600 --> 01:28:41,559
You slipped so far away

916
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:45,899
Where did we go a-stray

917
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,839
I forgot my hat.

918
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,479
Devon, Nancy's waiting on us.

919
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,959
...admitting life is hard

920
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:58,959
Without you near me

921
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:03,439
Ever since the day...

922
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:06,959
...the day went away...

923
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:12,979
When I felt that
emptiness so wide

924
01:29:14,940 --> 01:29:18,439
I don't know what's wrong or right

925
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,459
But I know I need
strength to fight

926
01:29:22,520 --> 01:29:27,879
Strength to fight that world outside

927
01:29:29,720 --> 01:29:33,359
Since we've been out of touch

928
01:29:33,520 --> 01:29:37,719
I haven't felt that much

929
01:29:37,880 --> 01:29:41,439
From day to barren day

930
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,919
My heart stays locked away

931
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:48,139
I walk the boulevard

932
01:29:49,080 --> 01:29:53,159
Admitting life is hard

933
01:29:54,120 --> 01:29:58,279
without you near me

934
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:03,119
The sun is sinking low

935
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:06,819
I guess it's time to go

936
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:10,799
I feel a chilly breeze

937
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:14,239
In place of memories

938
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:18,679
My dreams are
locked and barred

939
01:30:18,840 --> 01:30:23,299
Admitting life is hard

940
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:28,419
without you near me

941
01:30:37,350 --> 01:30:44,405
without you near me

942
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:50,359
You hear about that monster
that lives on a lake in Scotland?

943
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:53,739
Why?
You seeing stuff again?

944
01:30:53,840 --> 01:30:56,659
- No. Are you?
- No.

945
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:59,339
We're in Kansas.
There aren't monsters in lakes.

946
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:02,459
Just tornadoes and,
yellow brick roads.

947
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:09,639
Can you.. uh.. give me a lift
back to the hospital on the way back?

948
01:31:10,240 --> 01:31:12,839
I gotta get my final
evaluation today.

949
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:15,439
The therapist says I can...

950
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:17,319
I can live on my own again.

951
01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:22,879
You know what's scary is...
you're the most stable person I know.

952
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:34,139
I think they're late.

953
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,359
- Are you nervous?
- No.

954
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:42,499
Cause I did catch you
tapping your foot earlier.

955
01:31:44,720 --> 01:31:46,399
Real funny.

956
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:56,779
I think that...
they're here.

957
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:48,288
It's gonna be alright.
