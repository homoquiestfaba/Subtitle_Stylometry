00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,118
You're gonna have to
dance with me at the wedding.

181
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,628
Morning.
Morning.

182
00:09:21,695 --> 00:09:23,063
Or should I say
  afternoon.

183
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:25,331
Did you type up
the Sulley/Seth revisions?

184
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,800
Yes, I put them

     on your desk.

185
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:27,834
Great.

186
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,336
And merry Christmas.

187
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,370
Ooh.

188

If you hate it,
you can return it.

you'll return it.

Your sister called,
      and she can't

192
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:39,379
spend Christmas Eve
  with you after all.

193
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,648
Seems it's too painful
  since your father died,

194
00:09:41,715 --> 00:09:43,183

the next week

195
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,952

in the Catskills.

196
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,787
Good for her.
Also, your ex-husband called.

197
00:09:47,854 --> 00:09:49,089
Wanted to know
if you would like

198
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,157
to spend tonight with him
and his beautiful wife

199
00:09:51,224 --> 00:09:53,326
and their two perfect kids
in Connecticut.

00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,562
And...oh, finally,
your shrink called.

201
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:57,330
She's got to cancel
your session today

202
00:09:57,397 --> 00:09:58,732
because her husband
surprised her

203
00:09:58,798 --> 00:10:01,134
with a fabulous trip
to Paris for Christmas.

204
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:03,570
That's...all?

205
00:10:03,636 --> 00:10:04,771
It rang
a couple more times,

206
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,307
but I was scared for you,
so I stopped answering it.

[chuckling]
What's so funny?

208
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:12,712
Oh, it just struck me
    as being funny

209
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,381
that a, you know,
  a woman

210
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,750
who's never had a child
is editing a children's book

211
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:18,485
when maybe
it would be more appropriate

212
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,920
for me to work on
       Cooking For One

213
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,422

      that way.

Do you want
my advice?

218
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,563
No.

219
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,565
You've been looking
      after your mother for...

220
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,200
nearly ten years now,
right?

221

÷ ÷      Yeah.
Before that,

222
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,337
you were looking after
your father

223
00:10:37,404 --> 00:10:39,305
and also your husband,
who walked out on you

224
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:40,874
the day your mother
came to live with you,

225
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,841
and let's not forget--

226
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:42,876
What is the point?

227
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,711
It's time that you stop

00:10:44,778 --> 00:10:46,312

of everybody else

229
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:47,947
and start thinking
about yourself.

230
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:49,883
As my nana used to say,
what you need is--

231
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:50,950
I know; I know.

232
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,053
Someone to take care
  of me for a change.

233
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:54,354
Wrong, what you need
is sex.

234
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:55,722
Good sex.

235
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,324
Your nana
    said that?

236
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,160
Yes, she did.

237
00:11:00,226 --> 00:11:01,261
And by the way,

238
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,530

looking for you again.

He's too young
  for me.

Every woman
in the building wants him.

00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:15,875

some coffee.

 all the details.

I'll love it.
     No.

No, but it wasn't.

357
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:40,206
That's what I'm trying
to tell you,

358
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42,308
because they threw
this killer Christmas party

359
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,010
where the nurses
were dressed as elves,

360
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,345
and they were
singing songs,

361
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:46,813
and they were
handing out eggnog

362
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,181
with a little bit
of booze in it,

363
00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:49,816
and they even made
little presents,

364
00:15:49,883 --> 00:15:50,917
which was really cool.

365
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:54,220
That was awesome.

366
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,456
That was the best time
I ever had.

367
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:01,127
I know.

368
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:02,829
What--
I...

369
00:16:02,896 --> 00:16:04,097
I know.
I'm sorry.

370
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,665
You know what cup
    of cu fee this is?

371
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,334
Number four.
Where the hell you been?

372
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,302
Wedding plans,
you know.

373
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:11,304
Just one cup, I promise,
and we're out of here.

374
00:16:11,371 --> 00:16:12,972
What can I get you?

375
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,075
Just coffee.

376
00:16:15,141 --> 00:16:16,343
Oh, hi.

377
00:16:17,944 --> 00:16:19,145
Hi.

378
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:21,481
Just coffee,
and we're in a bit of a hurry.

379
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:23,049
Okay.

380
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,656
What was that
    all about?

381
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,790
I don't know.
Beats me.

382
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:32,258
You know the guy?

383
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,927
No, I never laid eyes
on him before.

384
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:34,994
You sure?

385
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,664
Yeah, I'm sure.

386
00:16:37,731 --> 00:16:40,133
Because he's looking at you
with that, you know, like...

387
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,068
it's, like, weird,
      you know what I'm saying?

388
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:44,070
No, what are you saying?

389
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,071
Okay, here you go.

390
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:46,473
Here's your coffee.

391
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:48,241
I had a feeling
you'd want it black.

392
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,876
Right, black.

393
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:52,145
And I got you
    almond butter cookies.

394
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,414
Almond butter cookies,
those are my favorite.

395
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,983
I know.

396
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:02,922
Ah, he's got
  a thing for ya.

397
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,257
Come on.
Cut it out.

398
00:17:04,324 --> 00:17:06,092
Come on; his eyes
      are all over you.

399
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:06,226
And that silly smile.
    I know that smile.

400
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:09,929
I'm gonna straighten this out
    right now.

401
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:11,031
All right,
   Mikey.

402
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,032
All right,
calm down now.

403
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:12,999
Come on;
      come on.

404
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:14,134
Now, you're a cop,
    for

405
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,201
Come on now.

406
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:16,636
You're a cop,
     okay?

407
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,139
÷ ÷     (man)
   Your turkey club's up,
   Artie.

408
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:21,508
You got my money?

409
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,076
Not yet.

410
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:24,611
Aw, come on,
Jules, look,

411
00:17:24,678 --> 00:17:25,712
if you want
to meet Arizona,

412
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:27,213
I have
    to get paid first.

413
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,782
Look, you know
I'm good for it, right?

414
00:17:28,848 --> 00:17:30,250
I just got to go d
this one thing,

415
00:17:30,316 --> 00:17:31,818
so why don't you
tell me where to meet you,

416
00:17:31,885 --> 00:17:33,153
and I'll bring you
the money.

417
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,255
All right, look.

418
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:36,690
Meet me
    at the old theater

419
00:17:36,756 --> 00:17:39,392
on Avenue A
    at about 10:00, all right?

420
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:41,428
But don't go in
  without me.

421
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,796
You wait for me.

422
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:44,497
Why?

423
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,666
Oh, you don't want
      to surprise a guy

424
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,134
like Arizona;
  that's why.

425
00:17:48,201 --> 00:17:49,803
All right.

426
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:50,837
Well, Glen,
you know

427
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:52,772
I really appreciate this,
right?

428
00:17:54,274 --> 00:18:00,714
It's Christmastime,
man.

429
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:05,785
^^ ^^

430
00:18:05,852 --> 00:18:07,253
He never has
any visitors,

431
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,388
not even family.

432
00:18:08,455 --> 00:18:10,156
Oh, except
for this one guy

433
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:11,358
that was there
this morning,

434
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:12,559
but I've never
seen him before,

435
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:13,693
and I just--
I don't know.

436
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,495
I wish there was something
I could do, you know.

437
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:18,631
To be sick and alone
and during the holidays,

438
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:20,834
it's awful.

439
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,569
You know, that's what
  I like about you, Rose.

440
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:26,539
What?
You care
  about other people.

441
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:28,308
You know,
I have to say

442
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:30,343
that I--
I'm...

443
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:33,446
Well, I just don't feel
like I'm really your type.

444
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:38,885
[laughing]
    I think you should
  let me decide that.

445
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:43,556
I'm a little uncomfortable
with you, Marco, sometimes.

446
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,492
Let's just relax
  and have fun, Rose.

447
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:47,227
Okay.

448
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,895
Good, because that's all
I really want to do

449
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:51,064
is just have some fun.
Hey, me too.

450
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:56,870
&@
    Didn't I tell you?

451
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:57,871
Best pizza
in the city.

452
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:58,872
Mm, mm.

453
00:18:58,938 --> 00:19:00,006
It's very good.

454
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:01,241
This place
    has been here forever.

455
00:19:01,307 --> 00:19:03,810
On the weekends,
there's a line around the block.

456
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:13,153
Why don't you
have a girlfriend?

457
00:19:13,219 --> 00:19:14,521
Or do you have
a girlfriend?

458
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,689
Well, I did,

459
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:17,724
but we broke up
      a few months ago.

460
00:19:17,791 --> 00:19:20,226
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

461
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,961
Don't be.
      It was good that it happened.

462
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,229
Why was it good
that it happened?

463
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:24,464
Ooh, hold it.
What?

464
00:19:24,531 --> 00:19:25,498
Cheese.

465
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:26,966
Cheese?

466
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,402
Yeah, on the side
    of your mouth.

467
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:30,804
Oh, God.

468
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:32,505
No, let me do it.

469
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,221
So now that I've saved you
    from Tony's pizza--

470
00:19:48,288 --> 00:19:49,222
[laughing]

471
00:19:49,289 --> 00:19:50,990
what shall we do now?

472
00:19:53,827 --> 00:19:55,362
Um...

473
00:19:55,428 --> 00:19:56,896
You want to see a movie?

474
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:59,833
No, not really.

475
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:04,204
Want to walk somewhere?

476
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,806
Yeah, but it's getting cold.

477
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,208
Don't you live around here?

478
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:12,445
Yes.

479
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,715
Well, we could, uh,
go back to your place,

480
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:17,751
maybe have a nightcap.

481
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:21,488
Um...

482
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,256
Marco, I-I...

483
00:20:23,323 --> 00:20:25,492
Rose, we work together
  in the same building.

484
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,726
What's the big deal?

485
00:20:26,793 --> 00:20:28,395
[laughing nervously]

486
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,864
You know me,

487
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:32,699
and it's Christmas Eve.

488
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,304
I don't have any...
  real liquor.

489
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:39,506
I just have eggnog.

490
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,408
No, I love eggnog.

491
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,842
Let's do it.

492
00:20:47,514 --> 00:20:48,882
Okay.

493
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,085
Okay.

494
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,800
Do you have family
  in the city?

495
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:07,801
No.

496
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,636
My family's
all down in Florida,

497
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:11,338
so it's just me here.

498
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:14,474
Great place.

499
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,675
You live here
all by yourself?

500
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:16,242
It's my mother's house.

501
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20,814
Well, here we are.

502
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:25,085
I'll get the eggnog.

503
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,053
You know, Rose.

504
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,621
I find you
    very sexy.

505
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,957
Thank you.

506
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:34,694
I'm gonna get
the nog.

507
00:21:37,897 --> 00:21:39,599
You're not
attracted to me?

508
00:21:42,302 --> 00:21:45,538
No, um...

509
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,806
I'm attracted to you.

510
00:21:49,576 --> 00:21:53,613
But this, you know,
it's going a little fast for me.

511
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,382
Okay.

512
00:21:55,448 --> 00:21:57,417
Let's just start
with a kiss.

513
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,785
All you have to do
is say stop,

514
00:21:58,852 --> 00:22:00,353
and I promise I will.

515
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:04,824
Okay.

516
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:06,192
Okay.

517
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:10,263
You promise?

518
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,699
Yes.

519
00:22:30,417 --> 00:22:31,384
Okay, stop.

520
00:22:31,451 --> 00:22:34,087
All right,
that was a little quick.

521
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,357
Yeah, I know it was,
but I'm--I...

522
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,758
How long has it been, Rose?

523
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:39,993
What?

524
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,796
How long it's been
since you've been on a date.

525
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:43,830
Um...

526
00:22:43,897 --> 00:22:45,932
You're a very
beautiful woman.

527
00:22:45,999 --> 00:22:48,635
You should be
      with someone.

528
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:49,636
Someone like me.

529
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,504
[giggles]

530
00:22:51,571 --> 00:22:52,906
You know,
    you work all the time.

531
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:54,841
I never see you go out,
      you know.

532
00:22:54,908 --> 00:22:57,110
You got to live
      a little.

533
00:22:57,177 --> 00:22:58,411
Life ain't that bad, Rose.

534
00:22:58,478 --> 00:22:59,646
You just got to lighten up.

535
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,616
Relax.

536
00:23:03,683 --> 00:23:06,820
Oh, gosh,
I just, uh...

537
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,688
It's just not
working for me.

538
00:23:08,755 --> 00:23:10,890
What did I say?

539
00:23:12,125 --> 00:23:14,928
Someone tells me
to lighten up and relax,

540
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,331
I just tighten up
    and get tense.

541
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,133
Hey, I just thought
    we could have a good time.

542
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,335
Yeah, me too,
but...

543
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:23,870
I was just trying
     to make you feel better.

544
00:23:23,937 --> 00:23:27,607
I know;
I know.

545
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,275
It didn't, though.

546
00:23:30,577 --> 00:23:34,014
I see.

547
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,315
I guess I better go.

548
00:23:37,317 --> 00:23:38,752
Yeah.

549
00:23:39,786 --> 00:23:41,654
Okay.

550
00:23:41,721 --> 00:23:42,756
I'm sorry.

551
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:43,823
No, no, no,
I'm sorry.

552
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,392
I was too forward.
I was wrong.

553
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,426
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

554
00:23:46,493 --> 00:23:49,029
It's not you.
      It's me.

555
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:52,265
You're right, Rose.
 It is you.

556
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,802
Merry Christmas, Rose.

557
00:23:58,304 --> 00:24:00,073
Merry Christmas.

558
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,641

Hey, you okay?

561
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:20,794
My stomach
      is a little nauseous.

562
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,929
I think I'm just
  stressed out.

563
00:24:22,996 --> 00:24:26,466
Nina, can you please
  just relax?

564

Hey.

569
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:38,378
What are you doing home
    so early?

570
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:40,880
You must be Mike.

571
00:24:40,947 --> 00:24:42,315
Surprise.

572
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,452
(Nina)
 What are you doing?

573
00:24:45,518 --> 00:24:46,586
This was for you,
you idiot.

574
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,754
He hit my lip.

575
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,789
What's going on
with this guy, Nina?

576
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,257
You can
    clean up here.

577
00:24:51,324 --> 00:24:52,759
What the hell is he doing
     in the apartment?

578
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:53,893
You have a serious problem.

579
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,061
Oh, I got a problem?

580
00:24:55,128 --> 00:24:56,429
What's he doing
      in the apartment?

581
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,198
Are you insane?

582
00:24:58,264 --> 00:24:59,399
Who is that guy, Nina?

583
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,234
This guy's my friend!

584
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:03,336
He was helping me
to prepare a surprise for you.

585
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:04,637
What kind of surprise?

586
00:25:04,704 --> 00:25:05,939
He's a tree decorator!

587
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,908
All right, look,
      I'm sorry, all right?

588
00:25:08,975 --> 00:25:10,410
I made a mistake.
You know what?

589
00:25:10,477 --> 00:25:12,412
You always
make a mistake.

590
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,214
Last week, you started
  a fight on the street

591
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,882
because you thought a guy
    was looking at me.

592
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,083
He was looking--
So what!

593
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,651
[screaming]
Men look at me.

594
00:25:18,718 --> 00:25:19,819
Get over it.

595
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,688
All right, look,
      I'm sorry, all right?

596
00:25:21,755 --> 00:25:22,956
It was just
  a misunderstanding.

597
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,090
It's just
      driving me crazy.

598
00:25:24,157 --> 00:25:25,625
I saw the two of you
  talking today--

599
00:25:25,692 --> 00:25:26,826
Talking when?

600
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:28,261
When I dropped you off
    at work today.

601
00:25:28,328 --> 00:25:30,130
I dropped you off at the office,
  and I saw you guys.

602
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:31,598
Do you spy on me?

603
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:32,866
||
  No, I don't spy on you.

604
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:34,334
Listen to me.

605
00:25:34,401 --> 00:25:35,835
I just--I saw
      the two of you talking, okay?

606
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:37,904
And then the next thing I know,
    you're hugging and kissing

607
00:25:37,971 --> 00:25:39,372
on each other...

608
00:25:39,439 --> 00:25:41,708
It was innocent, all right,
      believe me, completely.

609
00:25:41,775 --> 00:25:42,809
She was thanking me.

610
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:43,843
Thanking you
      for what?

611
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,911
This is insane.

612
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:46,279
Look, I can
      clear everything up.

613
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:47,414
Oh, that's not
the point.

614
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,515
I'm gay.

615
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:53,787
All right?

616
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,129
Nina, look,
  I'm sorry.

617
00:26:03,196 --> 00:26:04,330
I'm sorry.
Come on.

I don't know.

629
00:27:51,237 --> 00:27:53,006
Yeah, I don't know.
    Look, uh...

630
00:27:53,073 --> 00:27:55,742
Look, just tell her
I called, okay?

631
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:58,578
And tell her I love her.

are you doing here?

I need to see you.

00:28:21,501 --> 00:28:22,769
I have to talk to you.

Look, pal, you picked
a bad day to mess with me.

Now, you obviously
got me mixed up

00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:28,742
I just need
      ten minutes of your time.

I'm not gonna give you
ten seconds.

You beat it.
Ten minutes,
      that's all I ask.

I hope I didn't.

I was never gonna see you again.

it's obvious

Mm-hm.

693
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:37,430
I might be pregnant.

00:31:37,497 --> 00:31:38,798
Oh.

00:31:38,865 --> 00:31:40,767

who I am supposed to marry
    in one week

and who I love
very, very much

700
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,078
but who is
  a jealous psychopath

701
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:55,081
who thinks that every guy
wants to sleep with me

702
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:57,150
and who drives me crazy.

703
00:31:58,952 --> 00:32:02,088
You must think
I'm some crazy person,

blurting all this out.

705
00:32:04,357 --> 00:32:06,793
Oh, no, no.
    Not at all.

706
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,129
You know, because I'm
      a blurter myself.

707
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:11,097
Sometimes, you know,
you just have to

708
00:32:11,164 --> 00:32:12,766
get it out
    so that you can figure out

709
00:32:12,832 --> 00:32:14,200

00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,605
I'm Nina,
by the way.

712
00:32:20,607 --> 00:32:22,676
Nice to meet you.

713
00:32:22,742 --> 00:32:23,877
Rose.

714
00:32:25,845 --> 00:32:28,782
Uncle Pedro's friend
from Pittsburgh, right?

715
00:32:28,848 --> 00:32:30,016
[knocking]

716
00:32:30,083 --> 00:32:31,017
Dinner's ready.

717
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:33,353
Let's go inside.

718
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,388
Do I look like
I've been crying?

719
00:32:35,455 --> 00:32:37,490
No, no, no,
  you look beautiful.

720
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:38,692
I really--
      I can't--

721
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:41,227
Let's go have some fun.

722
00:32:41,294 --> 00:32:42,762
I have to go.
    I really--

723
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:43,997
Nina, por favor.

724
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:45,265
I could use a hand inside.
      Come on.

725
00:32:46,833 --> 00:32:49,035
Oh, please...

726
00:32:49,102 --> 00:32:50,770
Thank you.

727
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:54,107
(woman)
 Cariño,
pasamé ese plato.

728
00:32:54,174 --> 00:32:55,208
(man)
 Maria, come on.

729
00:32:55,275 --> 00:32:56,910
Everyone's at the table.

730
00:33:00,814 --> 00:33:03,183
Um, maybe there's somewhere
      I could use the bathroom?

731
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:04,250
Oh, yeah,
      right behind you.

732
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:06,086
Thanks.
      Thank you.

733
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,454
A ver,
     venga.

734
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,289
A comer.

735
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:17,864
[melancholy music]

736
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:21,534
^^ ^^

737
00:33:21,601 --> 00:33:23,570
Why not?

738
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:28,308
Yeah, okay.

739
00:33:32,078 --> 00:33:39,919
^^ ^^

740
00:33:42,756 --> 00:33:44,691
[conversation stops]

741
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:52,899
¿¿No es ella?

742
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:01,007
Wait, Rose.

743
00:34:01,074 --> 00:34:02,242
Rose, wait.

744
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:04,477
Oh, I'm so sorry,
really.

745
00:34:04,544 --> 00:34:06,513
That was so stupid.

746
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:07,647
Stay with us please.

747
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:08,715
Please stay with us.

748
00:34:08,782 --> 00:34:10,250
Tell your--
Please come back inside.

749
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:11,484
Tell your family
I am so sorry.

750
00:34:11,551 --> 00:34:12,485
Sorry for what?

751
00:34:12,552 --> 00:34:13,920
For crashing
your Chrtmas dinner.

752
00:34:13,987 --> 00:34:14,954
For trespassing.

753
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:16,056
For breaking
and entering.

754
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:18,024
For being just...
crazy.

755
00:34:18,091 --> 00:34:19,092
Please come back inside.

756
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,093
We'll make room.

757
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:22,028
That is so sweet,
but I am...

758
00:34:22,095 --> 00:34:23,263
Please.

759
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,532
I don't...

760
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:27,634
I don't fit in.

761
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,376
Me neither.

762
00:34:37,911 --> 00:34:39,346
Not tonight.

763
00:34:40,814 --> 00:34:42,315
I know a place
    around the corner.

764
00:34:42,382 --> 00:34:44,584
Maybe we can go there
      and talk.

765
00:34:44,651 --> 00:34:47,053
They're gonna
miss you.

766
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,655
Yeah.

767
00:34:48,722 --> 00:34:51,324
I'll come back.

768
00:34:51,391 --> 00:34:52,659
Okay?

769
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:55,028
You're crazier
than I am.

770
00:34:55,095 --> 00:34:56,396
Come on,
it's freezing.

771
00:34:56,463 --> 00:35:03,870
(Rose)
  It's so cold.

772
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:07,540
(man)

  ^^ Once again,
 it's Christmastime. ^^
    ^^ I'm not feeling chipper ^^

773
00:35:07,607 --> 00:35:10,744
^^ 'cause my girlfriend
just left me ^^

774
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:14,180
^^ for a male stripper. ^^

775
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:17,417
^^ She says
 I'm a total dweeb ^^

776
00:35:17,484 --> 00:35:20,920
^^ and I have no money. ^^

777
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:22,689
I know he loves me,

778
00:35:22,756 --> 00:35:25,158
and he's a great guy
with a huge heart.

779
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:27,460
Otherwise,
I wouldn't be with him,

780
00:35:27,527 --> 00:35:28,995
but he's just so--

781
00:35:29,062 --> 00:35:30,663
Controlling?

782
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:33,199
[sighs]
      Yes, controlling.

783
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:35,001
He doesn't have faith
      in what we have,

784
00:35:35,068 --> 00:35:36,036
how we feel.

785
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:37,203
He won't trust it.

786
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,373
I mean,
  I find myself praying

787
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,942
that he will change,
      but I don't know anymore.

788
00:35:44,544 --> 00:35:46,946
I mean, we're supposed
    to get married in one week.

789
00:35:47,013 --> 00:35:49,749
This is it.
      This is forever.

790
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,085
And I can't live like this.

791
00:35:52,152 --> 00:35:54,587
But I can't picture my life
    without him either.

792
00:35:54,654 --> 00:35:56,589
You love him very much.

793
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:59,225
[sighing]
Yeah, so much.

794
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,360
We even decided

795
00:36:00,427 --> 00:36:02,228
that we were gonna try
to have a baby

796
00:36:02,295 --> 00:36:05,198
since we just got
the apartment.

797
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:08,168
We both want a baby
    very badly.

798
00:36:08,234 --> 00:36:10,470
Even though it's a long shot.

799
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:11,738
I thought you were pregnant.

800
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:13,273
Yeah.

801
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,175
To tell you the truth,
  I'm not sure.

802
00:36:16,743 --> 00:36:20,080
Well, then you have
  to take a test and find out.

803
00:36:20,146 --> 00:36:21,381
Doctors have always told me

804
00:36:21,448 --> 00:36:24,050
that I have a very low chance
  of getting pregnant,

805
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:25,852
and I thought I was
    a few times before,

806
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,153
and then I wasn't,

807
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,922
so I don't want to take
  another test

808
00:36:28,988 --> 00:36:30,590
and be disappointed again.

809
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,260
Besides,
      I know I'm just nauseous

810
00:36:34,327 --> 00:36:36,196
from all the stress
of everything going on.

811
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:37,831
(man)
 Excuse me,
 ladies and gentlemen.

812
00:36:37,897 --> 00:36:40,066
We're having
    a little impromptu contest.

813
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,769
Winner takes home
    the stunning Christmas tree

814
00:36:42,836 --> 00:36:44,037
on my piano.

815
00:36:44,104 --> 00:36:45,505
Just step up to the mic
 and tell us

816
00:36:45,572 --> 00:36:46,940
why you hate Christmas.

817
00:36:47,007 --> 00:36:48,174
Best reason wins.

818
00:36:48,241 --> 00:36:51,444
All those interested,
    follow me.

819
00:36:55,382 --> 00:36:59,386
Look, all I know is
    that, um...

820
00:36:59,452 --> 00:37:01,688
nobody's perfect,
  and if you find love,

821
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:03,123
I mean real love,

822
00:37:03,189 --> 00:37:07,560
you just don't throw it away
    without a hell of a fight.

823
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,766
Yeah.

824
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:15,335
Yes.

825
00:37:15,402 --> 00:37:18,171
My wife used to do that
with her coffee.

826
00:37:18,238 --> 00:37:21,107
It was her one vice,
if you can call it that.

827
00:37:21,174 --> 00:37:23,410
It was more like
a simple pleasure, really,

828
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:26,713
just to put a little brandy
in her evening coffee,

829
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:29,916
and B&B,
just the way you do it.

830
00:37:29,983 --> 00:37:32,252
Who are you?

831
00:37:34,054 --> 00:37:36,156
Look, you've been
very, very kind to me,

832
00:37:36,222 --> 00:37:37,857
and I owe you
 an explanation.

833
00:37:37,924 --> 00:37:40,560
It's just very hard for me
  to get the words out.

834
00:37:40,627 --> 00:37:41,561
What I would like...

835
00:37:41,628 --> 00:37:43,296

and laughing]

838
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:53,907
(woman)
 Anybody home?

839
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:55,275
Oh, he's home.

840
00:37:55,342 --> 00:37:57,811
Ho ho ho.
  Merry Christmas, Mikey.

841
00:37:57,877 --> 00:37:59,145
What are you
    doing here?

842
00:37:59,212 --> 00:38:00,280
What am I doing here?

843
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,381
I come
      to cheer you up, man.

844
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:02,982
Look, this is Holly
    and Mary.

845
00:38:03,049 --> 00:38:04,517
Mikey, get it?

846
00:38:04,584 --> 00:38:06,453
Holly and Mary.

847
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:07,954
Come on,
    Christmas.

848
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:08,988
Dennis, I'm not sure

849
00:38:09,055 --> 00:38:10,423
this is such
a good time right now.

850
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:12,459
Yeah, the girl's room
is right around the corner here.

851
00:38:12,525 --> 00:38:14,294
Okay, okay,
 we're going.

852
00:38:14,361 --> 00:38:16,496
[giggling]

853
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,064
Look what
    I brought you.

854
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:19,232
Yeah, but, Dennis--

855
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,900
Mike, I get
    the redhead, okay?

856
00:38:22,836 --> 00:38:24,270
What's going on here,
Mikey?

857
00:38:24,337 --> 00:38:25,472
That's the guy
from the diner.

858
00:38:25,538 --> 00:38:26,773
What's he doing here?

859
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,441
I'm trying to get
to the bottom of this thing.

860
00:38:28,508 --> 00:38:29,809
You invited him
to your apartment.

861
00:38:29,876 --> 00:38:31,077
Mikey,
what are you thinking?

862
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:32,545
He could be
some sort of psycho.

863
00:38:32,612 --> 00:38:33,780
He's not a psycho.

864
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:35,448
Little strange maybe,
  but he's sweet.

865
00:38:35,515 --> 00:38:36,916
Sweet?

866
00:38:36,983 --> 00:38:38,585
Mike, is there something
  you want to tell me?

867
00:38:38,651 --> 00:38:40,253
What are you
    talking about?

868
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,655
I'm just trying to figure out
    what's going on with this guy.

869
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:45,158
I'm your partner.
You could tell me anything.

870
00:38:45,225 --> 00:38:46,593
[women's voices]

871
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:47,994
[laughing]

872
00:38:48,061 --> 00:38:50,330
Dennis, you got to get them
out of here.

873
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:52,232
Girls, Dennis,
I really appreciate

874
00:38:52,298 --> 00:38:54,701
you coming by
and your concern and everything.

875
00:38:54,768 --> 00:38:56,336
Mike, I don't trust
  this guy, okay?

876
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:57,437
I'm on my cell
  if you need me.

877
00:38:57,504 --> 00:38:58,805
Nah, I'll be all right.

878
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,740
Mike, I'm on my cell, okay?

879
00:39:00,807 --> 00:39:03,176
I'll be fine.

880
00:39:08,248 --> 00:39:09,916
What?

881
00:39:09,983 --> 00:39:12,652
I find that I'm very
attracted to you.

882
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:16,156
Oh, wait a minute.

883
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:17,157
I'm not gay.

884
00:39:17,223 --> 00:39:18,558
I'm not gay either.

885
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,859
I like women.

886
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:20,827
I love women.

887
00:39:20,894 --> 00:39:22,562
No, I mean
I really like women.

888
00:39:22,629 --> 00:39:23,997
I love women too.

889
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:24,998
And I'm getting married.

890
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:26,399
I'm getting married
  really soon

891
00:39:26,466 --> 00:39:28,501
to a really great woman
  that I love very much.

892
00:39:28,568 --> 00:39:31,504
I was married once
to a woman that I really loved,

893
00:39:31,571 --> 00:39:34,274
and that woman was you.

894
00:39:36,109 --> 00:39:37,043
Excuse me?

895
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:38,678
Do you believe
in reincarnation?

896
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:39,913
How could you not?

897
00:39:39,979 --> 00:39:41,448
When I looked at you
and you looked at me,

898
00:39:41,514 --> 00:39:43,183
I knew it was she.

899
00:39:43,249 --> 00:39:44,351
I knew it was
my Angeline,

900
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:45,652

901
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:47,220
All right, that's it.
  You're out of here.

902
00:39:47,287 --> 00:39:48,755
No, you're out of here!
  You're my wife.

903
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:50,523
Stay away from me!

904
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,992
Please, don't do this
    to me.

906

908

You're no fun tonight.

Give me one second,
 all right?

910
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:09,709
I don't trust this guy
 with my partner.

911
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:10,710
Something's wrong.

912
00:40:10,777 --> 00:40:13,013

Oh, nothing's wrong.

 Come on, Dennis.

915
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:20,587
Son of a bitch.
    I knew it.

916
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:23,123
No, no, Dennis.

 All right, listen,

921
00:40:30,196 --> 00:40:31,398
I got to straighten
 this guy out.

922
00:40:31,464 --> 00:40:33,433
I got to.
      I got to.

923

924
00:40:35,402 --> 00:40:38,638
What I do
 for my friends, my God.

925
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:40,874
All right, just--
     I got to.

926
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:42,042
All right,
 listen,

927
00:40:42,108 --> 00:40:44,310
I got to straighten
     this guy out.

928
00:40:44,377 --> 00:40:45,912
Just stay here.
Stay in the car.

929
00:40:45,979 --> 00:40:47,113
Oh, come on.

930
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,381
Dennis,
wait in the car?

931
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,488
Nina.

932
00:40:58,391 --> 00:40:59,526
What's the matter?

933
00:41:14,507 --> 00:41:16,476
I really love you.

934
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:22,782
But your jealousy
is killing me.

935
00:41:24,851 --> 00:41:28,521
You hold on so tight.

936
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:29,756
I can't breathe.

937
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:32,625
That's because
  I love you so much, though.

938
00:41:32,692 --> 00:41:34,194
Too much.

939
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,229
Come on,
      that's crazy.

940
00:41:36,296 --> 00:41:39,366
No, it's not.

941
00:41:39,432 --> 00:41:42,502
You have to let go,
Mike.

942
00:41:42,569 --> 00:41:43,770
If we're gonna make it,

943
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:48,641
then you have to
let go a little.

944
00:41:48,708 --> 00:41:50,677
I do have
another life,

945
00:41:50,744 --> 00:41:53,146
a career,

946
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:56,049
a job where I have to
talk to men.

947
00:41:56,116 --> 00:41:58,151
There's nothing
the matter with that.

948
00:41:58,218 --> 00:41:59,886
Yeah, but all
  these guys want

949
00:41:59,953 --> 00:42:01,421
is to take you
  to bed.

950
00:42:01,488 --> 00:42:04,057
So some of them try.
So what?

951
00:42:04,124 --> 00:42:06,693
You have
to trust me.

952
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,228
Who?

953
00:42:09,963 --> 00:42:11,031
Who what?

954
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:12,332
What guys try?

955
00:42:12,399 --> 00:42:13,566
tr
No.

956
00:42:13,633 --> 00:42:14,901
No, are they
friends of mine?

957
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,436
Do I know
  these guys?
I didn't say that.

958
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:17,704
No, are they guys
  from your work?

959
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:18,872
Did I ever
    meet them?

960
00:42:18,938 --> 00:42:20,340
Mike, did you hear
a word that I said?

961
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,708
What guys?

962
00:42:21,775 --> 00:42:23,243
Who are they?

963
00:42:24,744 --> 00:42:26,546
Why the hell
      did I come here?

964
00:42:26,613 --> 00:42:28,281
Come on.
      Listen to me.

965
00:42:28,348 --> 00:42:29,949
I don't want
to talk to you.

966
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:31,217
Now you're starting
to scare me.

967
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:32,485
You're gonna have
    to talk to me.

968
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:34,387
(Mike)
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

969
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:36,923
(Dennis)
      Mikey, your friend here's
waiting in the doorway hiding.

970
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:37,891
I wasn't hiding.

971
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:38,825
I wanted
 to be near you.

972
00:42:38,892 --> 00:42:40,026
I thought you might
come down again.

973
00:42:40,093 --> 00:42:41,027
Not now, Artie.

974
00:42:41,094 --> 00:42:42,328
Nina, please.
 Come on.

975
00:42:42,395 --> 00:42:43,329
Don't leave.

976
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:44,998
Get in the car.

977
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,501
This is all
  your fault.

978
00:42:48,568 --> 00:42:50,236
Why do you keep
      doing this to me?

979
00:42:50,303 --> 00:42:51,271
You're my life.

980
00:42:51,338 --> 00:42:52,739
You stay away
from me.

981
00:42:52,806 --> 00:42:53,707
I'm warning you.

982
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:55,008
Stay away from me!

983
00:42:55,075 --> 00:42:56,476
You understand me?

984
00:42:56,543 --> 00:42:57,544
Shit.

985
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,012
[groaning]

986
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,213
Mikey,
    what'd you do?

987
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,114
I didn't
       do anything.

988
00:43:01,181 --> 00:43:02,115
Get an ambulance.

989
00:43:02,182 --> 00:43:04,351
Get an ambulance.

990
00:43:04,417 --> 00:43:08,288

    Ms. Rose Harrison.

All right,
let's see.

993
00:43:16,463 --> 00:43:20,266
I hate Christmas
    because, uh...

994
00:43:20,333 --> 00:43:21,601
Well, you know,
  actually,

995
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:23,370
I don't completely
    hate Christmas.

996
00:43:23,436 --> 00:43:25,672
I, um...

997
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:28,441
There's...quite frankly,
a lot of things

998
00:43:28,508 --> 00:43:29,676
I love about Christmas:

999
00:43:29,743 --> 00:43:32,779
those little
  dome things that you shake--

1000
00:43:32,846 --> 00:43:34,514
[booing]

1001
00:43:34,581 --> 00:43:36,983
Right, okay, sorry.

1002
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:38,585
Um...

1003
00:43:38,651 --> 00:43:41,488
Okay, I got pregnant
  the summer that I turned 25,

1004
00:43:41,554 --> 00:43:43,656
and it wasn't something
  that my husband and I

1005
00:43:43,723 --> 00:43:45,892
really planned,
but, you know,

1006
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,461
we always wanted kids,
  so we were thrilled.

1007
00:43:48,528 --> 00:43:51,197
And we found out we were
      gonna have a little girl

1008
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:52,365
and we painted the room pink

1009
00:43:52,432 --> 00:43:53,800
with little bunnies
 and all that.

1010
00:43:53,867 --> 00:43:58,104
And we named her
after our maternal grandparents,

1011
00:43:58,171 --> 00:43:59,572
Olivia May.

1012
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:02,509
And the pregnancy was great,
    and the delivery was great,

1013
00:44:02,575 --> 00:44:05,879
and when she came out of me,
    she looked perfect.

1014
00:44:05,945 --> 00:44:09,082
She had just
    these little tiny,

1015
00:44:09,149 --> 00:44:10,750
tiny little fingers,
 all of them

1016
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:12,585
and little toes,
 and she was blonde.

1017
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:16,456
And you know, I don't know
what color eyes she had

1018
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:19,626
because, um,
      well, I never...

1019
00:44:19,693 --> 00:44:22,529
um, I never saw her eyes

1020
00:44:22,595 --> 00:44:25,598
because she, um...

1021
00:44:25,665 --> 00:44:28,535
Well, she...
    her heart stopped.

1022
00:44:28,601 --> 00:44:29,636
It just stopped,

1023
00:44:29,703 --> 00:44:31,871
and they told us
 that it was defective.

1024
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:33,807
And I tried to get pregnant
      again after that,

1025
00:44:33,873 --> 00:44:35,342
and it didn't happen.

1026
00:44:35,408 --> 00:44:40,013
And so I guess that's why
    I hate Christmas sometimes

1027
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:44,017
when I think
of Olivia May.

 That's a sad story,
     lady,

1029

but what's that got to do
with Christmas?

1030
00:44:52,492 --> 00:44:53,493
Oh, right.

1031
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,128
She, um...

1032
00:44:55,195 --> 00:45:00,567
Olivia May was born
    and died on Christmas Day.

and then turned the gun
    on herself.

1037

All right,
you go.

1060
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:25,352
I'll wait here.

1061
00:46:25,418 --> 00:46:26,419
You're not
      gonna goith me?

1062
00:46:26,486 --> 00:46:28,822
It's cool.
  Don't worry about it.

1063
00:46:28,888 --> 00:46:30,857
(Jules)
 Hi.

1064
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,740
So what can I do for you, son?

1065
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:50,276
Well, Glen said that, um...

1066
00:46:50,343 --> 00:46:52,812
Glen said what?

1067
00:46:52,879 --> 00:46:54,981
Glen said that you break hands.

1068
00:46:55,048 --> 00:46:57,717
Yes.

1069
00:46:57,784 --> 00:46:59,052
That's absolutely right.

1070
00:47:01,187 --> 00:47:02,822
And whose hands
  are we talking about?

1071
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:06,793
Mine.

1072
00:47:25,912 --> 00:47:26,980
Oh, sheez.

1073
00:47:27,047 --> 00:47:27,981
I'm s--oh, oh.

1074
00:47:28,048 --> 00:47:29,015
I'm sorry.

1075
00:47:29,082 --> 00:47:30,784
I'm so--
      my fault.

1076
00:47:30,850 --> 00:47:31,751
Everything okay?

1077
00:47:31,818 --> 00:47:33,353
I'm fine.

1078
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:36,856
Just maybe a few too many
      Christmas parties, but...

1079
00:47:36,923 --> 00:47:38,091
You meant me,
  didn't you?

1080
00:47:38,158 --> 00:47:39,559
[laughing]
Right.

1081
00:47:39,626 --> 00:47:41,261
I was just checking.

1082
00:47:41,327 --> 00:47:43,963
Um...

1083
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:45,432
So how's Helen?

1084
00:47:45,498 --> 00:47:49,636
Well, her blood pressure's
still a little high,

1085
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,304
but it's much improved
since this morning.

1086
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,872
Good.

1087
00:47:52,939 --> 00:47:56,009
But she's still
 not eating.

1088
00:47:56,076 --> 00:47:58,311
And I'm very concerned
    about that.

1089
00:47:58,378 --> 00:48:01,114
If she doesn't
eat something tonigh    I'm gonna come back  a little later and...

1090
00:48:01,181 --> 00:48:03,016
check on her.

1091
00:48:07,954 --> 00:48:08,888
All right.

1092
00:48:08,955 --> 00:48:10,290
Let's start
the celebration

1093
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:13,426
with some carrot cake,
huh?

1094
00:48:13,493 --> 00:48:15,462
Let's see.

1095
00:48:15,528 --> 00:48:17,163
Here we go.

1096
00:48:20,533 --> 00:48:22,369
Just a little nibble.

1097
00:48:22,435 --> 00:48:23,703
Here you go, Mom.

1098
00:48:23,770 --> 00:48:25,839
Come on.

1099
00:48:25,905 --> 00:48:27,507
Please.

1100
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:28,508
Come on.

1101
00:48:28,575 --> 00:48:29,542
Did you hear
the doctor?

1102
00:48:29,609 --> 00:48:31,277
It's really important
that you eat, okay?

1103
00:48:31,344 --> 00:48:33,346
Let's just try,
just a little nibble.

1104
00:48:33,413 --> 00:48:34,814
Please.

1105
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:37,050
Come on.

1106
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:39,085
Why won't you
eat anything?

1107
00:48:39,152 --> 00:48:41,421
[sighing]
Oh, God.

1108
00:48:44,424 --> 00:48:46,126
Okay, let's do the tree.

1109
00:48:46,192 --> 00:48:49,896
Look what I won, Mom.

1110
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:51,431
Huh, nice tree?

1111
00:48:51,498 --> 00:48:54,267
It'll cheer up
the room.

1112
00:48:54,334 --> 00:48:55,268
Okay.

1113
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:56,836
Let's see.

1114
00:49:02,542 --> 00:49:04,411
You like that, Mom,
    hm?

1115
00:49:04,477 --> 00:49:05,745
Merry Christmas.

1116
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:07,080
[hissing]

1117
00:49:07,147 --> 00:49:08,381
Oh.

1118
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,449
[laughing]
      Hold on.
  I'll get it.

1119
00:49:09,516 --> 00:49:10,583
I can fix it.

1120
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,352
Let's see.

1121
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:14,754
Just a little bit of...

1122
00:49:14,821 --> 00:49:17,657
What the hell's
 wrong with this thing?

1123
00:49:17,724 --> 00:49:19,225
Ah, just get this.

1124
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,193
I'm gonna fix it.

1125
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:22,796
Don't worry.

1126
00:49:22,862 --> 00:49:24,564
Damn it!

1127
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:28,868

I love you.

(woman)
   Get him in room two.

1133
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:38,138
What's going on here?

1134
00:50:38,204 --> 00:50:39,806
It's a pileup
on the West Side Highway.

1135
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:41,174
[woman screaming]
     You save him!

1136
00:50:41,241 --> 00:50:42,709
He needs help!

1137
00:50:42,776 --> 00:50:44,511
(man)
 Sir, I'll be
 right with you.

1138
00:50:44,577 --> 00:50:45,745
Looking for my mother.

1139
00:50:45,812 --> 00:50:47,414
She was involved
    in an accident on the highway.

1140
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,815
Her name
 is Evelyn Jents.

1141
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:51,484
I guess there isn't
  gonna be a party now.

1142
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:53,420
Not tonight, sweetie.

1143
00:50:53,486 --> 00:50:56,556
I'll try to scrounge up
some leftover eggnog for you.

1144
00:50:56,623 --> 00:50:58,024
Hi.

1145
00:50:58,091 --> 00:51:00,460
Sure wasn't like this
when I was 14.

1146
00:51:00,527 --> 00:51:02,662
That was the best Christmas
I ever had.

1147
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:03,663
That's great.

1148
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:04,798
Excuse me.

1149
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:06,499
Excuse me,
but I've been waiting for hours.

1150
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:08,034
Is there any news
on Artie Venezelos yet?

1151
00:51:08,101 --> 00:51:09,969
You're gonna have
  to talk to Nurse Stein.

1152
00:51:11,738 --> 00:51:12,672
Excuse me.

1153
00:51:12,739 --> 00:51:14,474
I was hoping
you could give me some news

1154
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:15,442
on Artie Venezelos.

1155
00:51:15,508 --> 00:51:16,676
Are you family?

1156
00:51:16,743 --> 00:51:18,378
No, not really.
I just--

1157
00:51:18,445 --> 00:51:20,113
Either you are,
  or you're not.

1158
00:51:21,781 --> 00:51:22,949
I'm a friend.

1159
00:51:23,016 --> 00:51:24,351
I'm sorry;
I can't give out

1160
00:51:24,417 --> 00:51:25,552
any medical information.

1161
00:51:25,618 --> 00:51:26,653
He's his friend.

1162
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:28,555
You know,
like his friend-friend.

1163
00:51:28,621 --> 00:51:29,989
I don't care
  if he's his priest.

1164
00:51:30,056 --> 00:51:31,691
Okay, thank you,
Nurse Ratched.

1165
00:51:31,758 --> 00:51:33,493
Listen.

1166
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,028
I will find out
      what I can, okay?

1167
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,463
Oh, man,
I really appreciate that.

1168
00:51:36,529 --> 00:51:37,664
You know,
but the truth of it is,

1169
00:51:37,731 --> 00:51:38,898
we're not even
really friends.

1170
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,233
Really?

1171
00:51:41,401 --> 00:51:42,569
It's okay.

1172
00:51:42,635 --> 00:51:44,738
I figured that.

1174
00:52:21,975 --> 00:52:22,909

 Can't swim.

[gasping]

1176
00:52:24,477 --> 00:52:27,814
Love to learn.

1177
00:52:27,881 --> 00:52:29,182
You're the guy
    from the hospital.

1178
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:30,183
Yeah, Charlie Boyd.

1179
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,217
You're the angel lady.

1180
00:52:32,919 --> 00:52:34,421
What are you doing here?

1181
00:52:34,487 --> 00:52:35,722
Did you follow me?

1182
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,924
No, not at all.

1183
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,659
Well, then,
well, why are you here?

1184
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:41,628
I could ask you
    the same question.

1185
00:52:41,695 --> 00:52:43,730
I just want you
    to leave me alone.

1186
00:52:43,797 --> 00:52:44,731
Can't do that.

1187
00:52:44,798 --> 00:52:45,899
I see a woman
standing alone

1188
00:52:45,965 --> 00:52:47,701
on a pier looking over a ledge,
  I gotta help.

1189
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:50,003
I don't want any help.

1190
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,504
If you jump in,
I'm gonna have to

1191
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:52,839
jump in right after you.

1192
00:52:52,906 --> 00:52:55,308
Who said anything
      about jumping in?

1193
00:52:55,375 --> 00:52:57,644
But if I did jump,
   you'd jump in after me

1194
00:52:57,711 --> 00:53:00,080
after you told me
  that you can't swim?

1195
00:53:00,146 --> 00:53:02,816
Yeah, because it's
the right thing to do.

1196
00:53:02,882 --> 00:53:04,117
And you always do
      the right thing?

1197
00:53:04,184 --> 00:53:05,418
Yeah, I do.

1198
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:06,953
It's a bad habit.

1199
00:53:09,823 --> 00:53:11,524
You want to tell me
 your sad story?

1200
00:53:11,591 --> 00:53:15,395
I'm a really good
      listener.

1201
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:18,398
I'm all ears.

1202
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:20,633
Good,
  I'll tell you mine.

1203
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:24,971
It's Christmas Eve,
    and I'm all alone.

That's it?

1205
00:53:28,842 --> 00:53:30,510
You're all alone?

1206
00:53:30,577 --> 00:53:32,112
That's the best
    you can do?

1207
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:34,080
There's more.

1208
00:53:34,147 --> 00:53:35,382
I'm a priest.

1209
00:53:35,448 --> 00:53:36,683
Really?

1210
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,984
Yeah, for 20 years.

1211
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:40,286
Then last year,
I left the priesthood.

1212
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:42,655
Kicked the habit.

1213
00:53:42,722 --> 00:53:44,491

Take anything
    off the top shelf.

      and get a cup of coffee,

and I'll guess more
of your story?

       to guess, Rose?

You're this amazing person,

but you're too busy
    helping others

1234

to see it.

00:54:42,515 --> 00:54:45,185
You take good care
of your friend, right?

1236
00:54:45,251 --> 00:54:46,820
Thanks.

1237
00:54:46,886 --> 00:54:48,822
Is he a close friend?

1238
00:54:50,990 --> 00:54:53,593
What's the matter?

1239
00:54:53,660 --> 00:54:56,296
Kind of a bad stomach.

1240
00:54:56,363 --> 00:54:59,065
[gasping]
    Hurts.

1241
00:54:59,132 --> 00:55:01,267
Hope we get
  someplace soon.

1242
00:55:06,973 --> 00:55:08,608
I don't feel
so good.

1243
00:55:08,675 --> 00:55:10,710
All right, well...

1244
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:13,480
My place is actually
not far from here.

1245
00:55:13,546 --> 00:55:15,281
Do you want
to go there?

1246
00:55:15,348 --> 00:55:16,783
You sure?
    Yeah.

1247
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:19,519
Driver,
three lights,

1248
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:21,421
take a left.

1249
00:55:22,589 --> 00:55:24,491
Hey, you know, I really
appreciate you doing this.

1250
00:55:24,557 --> 00:55:25,825
Aw, man,
I'm glad I could help.

1251
00:55:25,892 --> 00:55:27,727
I know hospital policy
      isn't always on our side.

1252
00:55:27,794 --> 00:55:28,895
They can be
      a little stuffy.

1253
00:55:28,962 --> 00:55:30,263
I remember when
  my lover got sick--

1254
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:31,531
Hey, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

1255
00:55:31,598 --> 00:55:33,066
You made a mistake,
uh, Randy.

1256
00:55:33,133 --> 00:55:34,801
Yeah, you're making
the wrong assumption

1257
00:55:34,868 --> 00:55:35,869
about Artie and I.

1258
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:38,138
I appreciate you
bringing me up here and all,

1259
00:55:38,204 --> 00:55:39,706
but the truth of it is,
we ain't a couple.

1260
00:55:39,773 --> 00:55:41,141
As a matter of fact,
I just met the guy.

1261
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:42,809
He's a waiter,
and I ordered some coffee--

1262
00:55:42,876 --> 00:55:44,577
Oh, my God,
    that's how my parents met.

1263
00:55:44,644 --> 00:55:46,046
My mother
waited on my father,

1264
00:55:46,112 --> 00:55:47,447
only he ordered
a tuna fish sandwich

1265
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:48,481
and a ginger ale.

1266
00:55:48,581 --> 00:55:49,883
No, now, now look.

1267
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:52,052
I just, I want
to make it clear that--

1268
00:55:52,118 --> 00:55:53,586
Don't worry.

1269
00:55:53,653 --> 00:55:55,355
Your secret's
      safe with me.

1270
00:56:00,894 --> 00:56:02,228
He's stable now.

1271
00:56:02,295 --> 00:56:05,131
Just thank God
 for small blessings, right?

1272
00:56:05,198 --> 00:56:06,232
Let him know
you're here.

1273
00:56:06,299 --> 00:56:08,101
I don't care
      what the doctors say.

1274
00:56:08,168 --> 00:56:09,803
Talk to him.
 Tell him how you feel.

1275
00:56:09,869 --> 00:56:11,204
He'll hear you.

1276
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:13,273
Mike,
    we got to talk.

1277
00:56:13,340 --> 00:56:14,341
Oh, hi.

1278
00:56:14,407 --> 00:56:15,342
Oh, my.

1279
00:56:15,408 --> 00:56:16,309
Who's that?

1280
00:56:16,376 --> 00:56:17,610
Nah, forget about it.

1281
00:56:17,677 --> 00:56:19,279
What do you got?
    I went
  to the station.

1282
00:56:19,346 --> 00:56:20,680
I got some info
on this guy.

1283
00:56:20,747 --> 00:56:22,816
Did you know your friend here
      served four years

1284
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:26,186
on a ten-year sentence
  for manslaughter back in '79?

1285
00:56:26,252 --> 00:56:28,355
This guy?
      Yeah, that's him.

1286
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:30,090
It was
  a domestic dispute.

1287
00:56:30,156 --> 00:56:32,459
This Venezelos
  comes home,

1288
00:56:32,525 --> 00:56:34,160
finds his wife
with another guy, right,

1289
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:36,096
but it's no boyfriend
  or nothing,

1290
00:56:36,162 --> 00:56:37,530
just an old friend.

1291
00:56:37,597 --> 00:56:39,032
He goes into a rage,

1292
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:40,633
accuses her
  of being unfaithful, right?

1293
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:42,602
Him and this guy
get into some words.

1294
00:56:42,669 --> 00:56:44,270
They start
going at each other.

1295
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:46,873
He throws the guy
down a flight of stairs.

1296
00:56:46,940 --> 00:56:48,375
The guy's neck breaks.

1297
00:56:48,441 --> 00:56:49,743
He died
  in the hospital

1298
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:50,744
a few hours later.

1299
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,045
Wait,
    it gets worse.

1300
00:56:52,112 --> 00:56:54,614
The wife takes off
before the cops show up, right?

1301
00:56:54,681 --> 00:56:56,416
She jumps in her car
      and speeds away.

1302
00:56:56,483 --> 00:56:57,817
She's doing, like,
      about 80

1303
00:56:57,884 --> 00:56:59,819
when she skids out
      on this icy curve

1304
00:56:59,886 --> 00:57:02,355
and hits an oncoming car
      head on.

1305
00:57:02,422 --> 00:57:04,591
She was killed instantly.

1306
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,495
Mike.

1307
00:57:10,497 --> 00:57:12,499
Whoa, Mikey,
   you all right?

1308
00:57:12,565 --> 00:57:13,733
Yeah.

1309
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,769
Yeah, I'm okay.

1310
00:57:15,835 --> 00:57:17,570
Well, at least we know
    who the nut is now, right?

1311
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:19,339
Naw, he's not nuts.

1312
00:57:19,406 --> 00:57:20,607
Yeah, all right.
      Whatever.

1313
00:57:20,674 --> 00:57:22,008
Let's get out of here.
    I'll take you home.

1314
00:57:22,075 --> 00:57:23,677
Nah, I'm gonna stay
      around here for a while.

1315
00:57:23,743 --> 00:57:25,178
For what?
    They can take care of him.

1316
00:57:25,245 --> 00:57:26,413
Come on,
let's get out of here.

1317
00:57:26,479 --> 00:57:29,082
Dennis, listen to me.

1318
00:57:29,149 --> 00:57:30,417
Something's going on here.

1319
00:57:30,483 --> 00:57:32,752
I don't know what it is,
but I'm gonna find out.

1320
00:57:32,819 --> 00:57:34,587
I appreciate you coming by
and everything,

1321
00:57:34,654 --> 00:57:36,556
but I got to
  figure this one out.

1322
00:57:38,058 --> 00:57:39,459
You gonna be all right?

1323
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:41,761
Yeah, I'm gonna be all right.

1324
00:57:41,828 --> 00:57:43,163
All right.

1325
00:57:44,764 --> 00:57:46,366
All right,
merry Christmas, partner, huh?

1326
00:57:46,433 --> 00:57:47,567
Merry Christmas.

1327
00:57:47,634 --> 00:57:48,568
Whoa.

1328
00:57:48,635 --> 00:57:49,536
I didn't see
nothing.

1329
00:57:49,602 --> 00:57:50,537
What is it
with this guy?

1330
00:57:50,603 --> 00:57:51,638
You don't even
want to know.

1331
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:53,139
All right, later.

1332
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:55,475
Take care.

1333
00:57:59,412 --> 00:58:01,614
[sighs]

1334
00:58:01,748 --> 00:58:03,116
This is really hot.

1335
00:58:03,183 --> 00:58:04,384
Be careful.

1336
00:58:04,451 --> 00:58:05,585
It's tea
  with bitters.

1337
00:58:05,652 --> 00:58:07,320
It's good
      for your stomach.

1338
00:58:07,387 --> 00:58:08,588
Thanks for letting me
come here.

1339
00:58:08,655 --> 00:58:09,589
Oh, sure.

1340
00:58:09,656 --> 00:58:10,557
It's not right,
you know.

1341
00:58:10,623 --> 00:58:12,092
I should be the one
helping you.

1342
00:58:12,158 --> 00:58:13,693
Oh, no, I'm the one
  that always

1343
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,762
takes care of everybody,
      remember?

1344
00:58:15,829 --> 00:58:17,097
My thing.

1345
00:58:17,163 --> 00:58:18,798
Must be something
      you need, though.

1346
00:58:18,865 --> 00:58:19,866
What do you mean?

1347
00:58:19,933 --> 00:58:21,267
Well,

1348
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:23,169
what do you want most
      in the whole world, Rose?

1349
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:31,444
I guess just to make it
through the night would be nice.

1350
00:58:31,511 --> 00:58:33,747
Now we're talking.

1351
00:58:33,813 --> 00:58:35,615
I can definitely
help with that.

1352
00:58:39,052 --> 00:58:41,187
Did I just invite myself
    to spend the night?

1353
00:58:41,254 --> 00:58:43,189
[giggles]
      Sort of.

1354
00:58:44,758 --> 00:58:46,026
Maybe I should go.

1355
00:58:46,092 --> 00:58:47,193
No.

1356
00:58:48,628 --> 00:58:49,996
Stay.

1357
00:58:50,063 --> 00:58:51,931
You sure?

1358
00:58:53,066 --> 00:58:54,534
Yeah.

1359
00:58:54,601 --> 00:58:56,970
On condition that you tell me
      what it is that you want.

1360
00:58:57,037 --> 00:58:59,572
That's fair.

1361
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:01,975
I don't want to be alone
    when I die.

1362
00:59:02,042 --> 00:59:04,077
Is that too much?

1363
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,982
No. No.

1364
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:10,650
No.

1365
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:15,388
You sure that's him?

1366
00:59:15,455 --> 00:59:16,356
Doctor,
believe me.

1367
00:59:16,423 --> 00:59:17,524
He was just here
this morning.

1368
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:19,125
So you think
  that it was self-inflicted.

1369
00:59:19,192 --> 00:59:20,427
Absolutely.

1370
00:59:20,493 --> 00:59:22,796
(doctor)
 Well, if that's the case,

1371
00:59:22,862 --> 00:59:25,165
we can hold him
 for up to 24 hours

1372
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:27,600
for observation if we think
 he's a danger to himself.

1373
00:59:27,667 --> 00:59:29,502
Have the resident psychiatrist
    have a talk to him

1374
00:59:29,569 --> 00:59:30,804
before we decide
    to let him go.

1375
00:59:30,870 --> 00:59:32,672
Okay.

1376
00:59:35,041 --> 00:59:36,476
Look, if there's not
      gonna be a party,

1377
00:59:36,543 --> 00:59:37,577
I want to go now.

1378
00:59:37,644 --> 00:59:39,346
Can't leave right now.
Why?

1379
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:41,081
You have to speak
    to another doctor.

1380
00:59:41,147 --> 00:59:42,248
For what?

1381
00:59:42,315 --> 00:59:43,616
Those are the rules.

1382
00:59:43,683 --> 00:59:46,019
Look, you can't
    just keep me here.

1383
00:59:46,086 --> 00:59:47,721
I can't,
but he can.

1384
00:59:50,457 --> 00:59:51,858
Now sit down.

1385
00:59:55,428 --> 00:59:56,930
[both chuckle]

1386
00:59:59,032 --> 01:00:02,836
Charlie, I hope
you don't mind my asking, but...

1387
01:00:02,902 --> 01:00:06,272
Why did you leave the priesthood
after 20 years?

1388
01:00:09,109 --> 01:00:10,710
I lost my faith.

1389
01:00:13,146 --> 01:00:16,416
And I began to question
      the existence of God.

1390
01:00:16,483 --> 01:00:19,753
If you're a priest,
that's not good.

1391
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:22,655
So here I am.

1392
01:00:22,722 --> 01:00:23,623
I'm sorry.

1393
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:24,891
It's all right.

1394
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:28,094
What about you?
What about me?

1395
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:29,229
How's your faith?

1396
01:00:29,295 --> 01:00:30,330
Oh, it's pretty shaky.

1397
01:00:30,397 --> 01:00:31,531
Really?
  Why?

1398
01:00:32,999 --> 01:00:34,434
Well, my mom's been sick

1399
01:00:34,501 --> 01:00:36,069
for a long time
      with Alzheimer's,

1400
01:00:36,136 --> 01:00:37,470
and she was always the glue

1401
01:00:37,537 --> 01:00:38,972
that kind of
      kept the family together.

1402
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,807
Now she can't even
bathe herself.

1403
01:00:40,874 --> 01:00:43,576
And I keep trying
to reconnect with her.

1404
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:45,412
How do you do that
  with someone who's not there?

1405
01:00:45,478 --> 01:00:48,281
Well, I put...

1406
01:00:48,348 --> 01:00:50,150
I put pictures of the family
  all around the room,

1407
01:00:50,216 --> 01:00:51,518
and I bring her
    her favorite foods.

1408
01:00:51,584 --> 01:00:52,819
I play her favorite music.

1409
01:00:52,886 --> 01:00:54,154
You know,
    I'm just trying to find her

1410
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,456
just even for, like,
      a second,

1411
01:00:56,523 --> 01:00:59,059
just to have some kind
of moment of clarity, you know,

1412
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:02,028
so that I know
    she's still there.

1413
01:01:02,095 --> 01:01:05,065
Does it work?

1414
01:01:05,131 --> 01:01:08,735
No.

1415
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:10,704
Do you pray?

1416
01:01:10,770 --> 01:01:13,406
No, not anymore.

1417
01:01:13,473 --> 01:01:15,575
Yeah, I know
  how that is.

1418
01:01:21,648 --> 01:01:23,650
Only five more hours
to go.

1419
01:01:23,717 --> 01:01:25,852
Till what?

1420
01:01:25,919 --> 01:01:27,987
Till you make it
    through the night.

1421
01:01:32,992 --> 01:01:35,195
This is mesmerizing.

1422
01:01:35,261 --> 01:01:36,296
Not for five hours.

1423
01:01:36,363 --> 01:01:37,397
No.

1424
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:38,932
We should put
      another tape on.

1425
01:01:43,370 --> 01:01:44,704
How you doing?

1426
01:01:44,771 --> 01:01:46,106
[vomiting]

1427
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:48,742
Look, I want
to go home now!

1428
01:01:48,808 --> 01:01:50,310
All right?
    This is all wrong.

1429
01:01:50,377 --> 01:01:52,579
This is not the way
  it's supposed to be!

1430
01:01:52,645 --> 01:01:53,747
Calm down, Mr. Calvert.

1431
01:01:53,813 --> 01:01:54,981
Oh, you want me
  to calm down.

1432
01:01:55,048 --> 01:01:56,583
Calm down, Mr. Calvert.

1433
01:01:56,649 --> 01:01:58,218
Calm down.
      I can calm down.

1434
01:01:58,284 --> 01:01:59,219
That calm enough
       for you?

1435
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:01,654
What about that?

1436
01:02:01,721 --> 01:02:03,957
[struggling
and yelling]

1437
01:02:04,024 --> 01:02:05,258
Get him on the other side.

1438
01:02:05,325 --> 01:02:06,292
What are you doing?

1439
01:02:06,359 --> 01:02:08,028
I got a broken hand.

1440
01:02:08,094 --> 01:02:09,162
Put me--

1441
01:02:09,229 --> 01:02:10,764
I didn't
 do anything wrong.

1442
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:12,399
÷ ÷Orderly!
  Let me go.

1443
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:13,767
Come on.
Come on.

1444
01:02:15,468 --> 01:02:18,004
You know, Artie,
I got to tell you,

1445
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,739
I feel really bad
about what happened

1446
01:02:19,806 --> 01:02:22,042
at the apartment today,
and I want you to know that,

1447
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:24,310
you know,
I wasn't mad at you.

1448
01:02:24,377 --> 01:02:26,846
See, I was...
I was mad...

1449
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:30,483
[sighing]
Man, Artie,

1450
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:33,319
I really screwed things up
between Nina and me.

1451
01:02:33,386 --> 01:02:35,021
You have no idea.

1452
01:02:37,891 --> 01:02:41,061
Actually, you probably do,
don't you?

1453
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,907
Hey, Artie.

1454
01:02:53,973 --> 01:02:56,743
I got to know.

1455
01:02:56,810 --> 01:02:59,012
That stuff
you were saying today,

1456
01:02:59,079 --> 01:03:04,250
about you and me,
      you know,

1457
01:03:04,317 --> 01:03:07,020
about your wife,
    that was just crazy, right?

1458
01:03:07,087 --> 01:03:10,090
Just some
  big misunderstanding, right?

1459
01:03:10,156 --> 01:03:11,257
[footsteps]

1460
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,195
Who are you?

1461
01:03:15,261 --> 01:03:16,896
I'm a friend.

1462
01:03:18,998 --> 01:03:21,001
I've never
met you before.

1463
01:03:21,067 --> 01:03:22,569
Paul Venezelos.

1464
01:03:22,635 --> 01:03:24,337
Hi.

1465
01:03:24,404 --> 01:03:26,206
Michael Reilly.

1466
01:03:26,272 --> 01:03:28,041
I'm the guy
that took him here.

1467
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:29,342
I'm a cop.

1468
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,377
Oh, thank you.

1469
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:31,478
Yeah.

1470
01:03:31,544 --> 01:03:33,480
So how's he doing?

1471
01:03:33,546 --> 01:03:35,115
He's stable.

1472
01:03:38,718 --> 01:03:40,086
All right.

1473
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:41,988
Well, thanks for sitting
      with him.

1474
01:03:42,055 --> 01:03:43,323
It was good to meet you.

1475
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,525
Yeah, of course.

1476
01:03:51,998 --> 01:03:52,999
Mike.

1477
01:03:54,034 --> 01:03:55,735
Yeah?

1478
01:03:55,802 --> 01:03:57,337
He didn't give you
  some cockamamy story

1479
01:03:57,404 --> 01:03:59,639
about you being
my reincarnated mother, did he?

1480
01:04:02,809 --> 01:04:04,978
He did, didn't he?

1481
01:04:06,613 --> 01:04:08,982
He's been doing that
to some poor unsuspecting chump

1482
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:10,583
every Christmas
 since she died.

1483
01:04:12,452 --> 01:04:13,553
Well, look,

1484
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:14,854
I promise I'll let him know

1485
01:04:14,921 --> 01:04:16,589
that you were here
  when he wakes up, all right?

1486
01:04:16,656 --> 01:04:18,825
Yeah.

1487
01:04:18,892 --> 01:04:20,694
I appreciate it.

1488
01:04:29,436 --> 01:04:37,377

      Can't believe
    you're still here.

1490
01:05:33,667 --> 01:05:34,801
So he likes to tell people

1491
01:05:34,868 --> 01:05:36,469
they're your
reincarnated mother, huh?

1492
01:05:36,536 --> 01:05:37,771
Yeah.

1493
01:05:37,837 --> 01:05:39,739
Always around Christmas.

1494
01:05:44,344 --> 01:05:45,578
Look, I'm sorry
about your mother

1495
01:05:45,645 --> 01:05:46,846
and all that happened.

1496
01:05:48,915 --> 01:05:50,617
He told you what happened?

1497
01:05:50,684 --> 01:05:52,485
Yeah, a little.

1498
01:05:52,552 --> 01:05:54,154
You know,
he mentioned it once.

1499
01:05:54,220 --> 01:05:55,255
Wow.

1500
01:05:55,321 --> 01:05:57,691
My father
never talked about that.

1501
01:06:00,326 --> 01:06:02,529
Anyhow, I'm sorry.

1502
01:06:02,595 --> 01:06:05,365
Pop, you know,
he just can't seem to forget it.

1503
01:06:05,432 --> 01:06:07,934
It's the past
that holds onto him.

1504
01:06:08,001 --> 01:06:10,136
We don't count.

1505
01:06:10,203 --> 01:06:11,438
No matter what we do,

1506
01:06:11,504 --> 01:06:13,039
no matter how much
  we try to be there for him,

1507
01:06:13,106 --> 01:06:16,142
we just can't reach him.

1508
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:18,745
I can't reach him.

1509
01:06:20,013 --> 01:06:21,014
Do you know he still keeps

1510
01:06:21,081 --> 01:06:22,816
that glass angel by his bed?

1511
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:25,885
I swear he sees
her face in it.

1512
01:06:25,952 --> 01:06:29,022
Glass angel?

1513
01:06:29,089 --> 01:06:30,557
Yeah, my mother
      had it blown out of glass

1514
01:06:30,623 --> 01:06:32,058
to put on top of the tree.

1515
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,861
It was a surprise for Pop.

1516
01:06:36,496 --> 01:06:38,865
Sounds like
they loved each other very much.

1517
01:06:38,932 --> 01:06:40,300
They did.

1518
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,337
All my father's looking for
      is a little forgiveness.

1519
01:06:44,404 --> 01:06:45,772
Where's the harm in that?

1520
01:06:47,674 --> 01:06:49,976
Forgiveness from who?

1521
01:06:50,043 --> 01:06:51,911
From her.

1522
01:06:51,978 --> 01:06:54,848
He screwed up,
 and he's sorry.

1523
01:06:54,914 --> 01:06:57,851
He just never got a chance
  to tell her.

1524
01:07:03,923 --> 01:07:05,658
I got to take
a walk.

1525
01:07:05,725 --> 01:07:09,629
I'll be right back.

1526
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:10,797
Keep an eye on him.

1527
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:13,900
Yeah, you got it.

1528
01:07:21,441 --> 01:07:24,310
[melodramatic music]

1529
01:07:24,377 --> 01:07:32,318
^^ ^^

1530
01:08:54,401 --> 01:08:56,336
(Rose)
 Morning.

1531
01:08:57,804 --> 01:08:59,172
Morning.

1532
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:01,341
How you feeling?

1533
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:02,942
Rose.

1534
01:09:03,009 --> 01:09:04,544
Charlie,
if you have to leave,

1535
01:09:04,611 --> 01:09:05,779
I understand,
really.

1536
01:09:05,845 --> 01:09:07,147
It's fine.

1537
01:09:07,213 --> 01:09:09,049
Look, I made it
through the night, didn't I?

1538
01:09:09,115 --> 01:09:10,917
Yes, you have.

1539
01:09:10,984 --> 01:09:13,253
But is that
  what you really wanted?

1540
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,521
Just to make it
      through the night

1541
01:09:14,587 --> 01:09:16,556
and that's all?

1542
01:09:16,623 --> 01:09:20,326
Well, I suppose
I'd like to think

1543
01:09:20,393 --> 01:09:22,328
that my life matters.

1544
01:09:22,395 --> 01:09:24,531
Oh, your life matters.

1545
01:09:24,597 --> 01:09:26,099
You've touched
other people's lives

1546
01:09:26,166 --> 01:09:27,600
in ways you don't
      even realize.

1547
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:29,102
[scoffing]
How do you know that?

1548
01:09:29,169 --> 01:09:30,236
Because you touched
my life.

1549
01:09:30,303 --> 01:09:32,405
You're just
being nice, Charlie.

1550
01:09:32,472 --> 01:09:33,606
No, Rose,
      I'm not.

1551
01:09:33,673 --> 01:09:34,641
It's more than that.

1552
01:09:34,708 --> 01:09:36,843
You saved me, Rose.

1553
01:09:38,645 --> 01:09:39,746
I was wondering
where God was,

1554
01:09:39,813 --> 01:09:42,015
and the next thing you know,
  there you are

1555
01:09:42,082 --> 01:09:44,250
at the bedside
   of a complete stranger

1556
01:09:44,317 --> 01:09:47,520
telling him you love him
    with such meaning.

1557
01:09:47,587 --> 01:09:49,322
And then I knew
      God was there

1558
01:09:49,389 --> 01:09:51,825
in that room
      with you.

1559
01:09:51,891 --> 01:09:53,226
You were there?

1560
01:09:53,293 --> 01:09:54,361
?
  Yeah.

1561
01:09:54,427 --> 01:09:56,196
Why did you do that,
  Rose?

1562
01:09:58,198 --> 01:09:59,933
I...

1563
01:10:03,069 --> 01:10:04,771
Because he was just so alone,

1564
01:10:04,838 --> 01:10:07,207
and...

1565
01:10:09,209 --> 01:10:12,078
I guess I know
    what it feels like.

1566
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:13,513
I know.

1567
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,515
That's why your mother
 wants you to let go

1568
01:10:15,582 --> 01:10:18,118
and live a life.

1569
01:10:18,184 --> 01:10:19,686
What?

1570
01:10:19,753 --> 01:10:21,988
Your mother wants you
      to live your life, Rose.

1571
01:10:22,055 --> 01:10:23,156
You don't know my mother.

1572
01:10:23,223 --> 01:10:24,057
She knows
       you love her

1573
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:25,358
and you're there for her.

1574
01:10:25,425 --> 01:10:26,659
Why are you doing this?

1575
01:10:26,726 --> 01:10:27,994
Because she told me
  to tell you.

1576
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:29,896
That's not funny.

1577
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:31,498
And you're scaring me.

1578
01:10:31,564 --> 01:10:32,699
No, Rose,

01:10:32,766 --> 01:10:33,833
I don't have
    much time.

01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:34,834
Charlie, please.

1581
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:36,102
I don't want
to listen.

1582
01:10:36,169 --> 01:10:37,637
Please listen
    to what I have to say.

1583
01:10:37,704 --> 01:10:38,638
Get out of the house.

1584
01:10:38,705 --> 01:10:39,806
I don't want you
here anymore.

1585
01:10:39,873 --> 01:10:40,974
I'm not gonna leave

1586
01:10:41,041 --> 01:10:42,275
till you hear
  what I have to say.

1587
01:10:42,342 --> 01:10:44,811
She spoke to me
  last night.

1588
01:10:44,878 --> 01:10:46,279
All right,
I'm calling the police.

1589
01:10:46,346 --> 01:10:47,447
I know it's hard
 to believe.

1590
01:10:47,514 --> 01:10:48,548
I mean it, Charlie.
Get out!

1591
01:10:48,615 --> 01:10:49,716
That's what
  she wants.

1592
01:10:49,783 --> 01:10:51,484
I know that
      would make her happy.

1593
01:10:51,551 --> 01:10:52,819
Happy?

1594
01:10:52,886 --> 01:10:54,421
Happy.

1595
01:10:54,487 --> 01:10:56,856
My mother doesn't even know
she's my mother.

1596
01:10:56,923 --> 01:10:57,991
She doesn't hear me.

1597
01:10:58,058 --> 01:10:58,992
She doesn't see me.

1598
01:10:59,059 --> 01:11:00,393
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1599
01:11:00,460 --> 01:11:02,495
When you look in her eyes,
you see absolutely nothing.

1600

She's not there,
do you understand?

1601
01:11:03,997 --> 01:11:06,499
I'm watching
my mother die bit by bit.

1602
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,601
So don't you tell me
about my mother.

1603
01:11:08,668 --> 01:11:09,769
Get out of here!

1604
01:11:09,836 --> 01:11:11,571

I love you, Rose.

1606

Did you do that
  to yourself, Jules?

1607
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:31,091
No.

1608
01:11:31,157 --> 01:11:33,259
Well, there are some people
here at the hospital

1609
01:11:33,326 --> 01:11:35,829
that think you might have.

Hey, look,
this is bull have to
go through with this?

If you want
    to leave, yes.

1612
01:11:41,401 --> 01:11:42,535
All right.

1613
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:44,604
Fine.

I'll play
this game.

1615
01:11:46,006 --> 01:11:48,842
My dad died
when I was real young.

1616
01:11:48,908 --> 01:11:50,176
My mother
      married some guy

1617
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:52,379
with quick hands
  who didn't have time for me.

1618
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:53,713
So he hit you?

1619
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:54,748
Yes.

1620
01:11:54,814 --> 01:11:55,749
A lot?

When he felt like it.

1622
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,852
They still married?

1623
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:00,220
I heard he died
years ago,

1624
01:12:00,286 --> 01:12:02,522
which made me
very happy.

1625
01:12:02,589 --> 01:12:04,457
When was the last time
      you spoke to your mother?

1626
01:12:04,524 --> 01:12:06,860
I told you,
I don't have a mother.

1627
01:12:06,926 --> 01:12:08,461
I want to help you, Jules,

1628
01:12:08,528 --> 01:12:09,963
but unless
you tell me the truth,

1629
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:10,930
I can't.

1630
01:12:10,997 --> 01:12:12,732
So tell me,

1631
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:15,068
did you do that
  to your hand?

1632
01:12:16,870 --> 01:12:19,305
Yes.

1633
01:12:19,372 --> 01:12:21,441
Why?

1634
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:25,478
By the time I was 14,

1635
01:12:25,545 --> 01:12:27,714
I was taking a beating
    every day.

1636
01:12:27,781 --> 01:12:29,449
And once,
 it got so bad,

1637
01:12:29,516 --> 01:12:30,550
he even threw
 my mother

1638
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:32,218
halfway across the room.

1639
01:12:32,285 --> 01:12:34,754
And that's when
    I told him to stop.

1640
01:12:34,821 --> 01:12:36,389
That's all I said.

1641
01:12:36,456 --> 01:12:37,691
"Stop it."

1642
01:12:37,757 --> 01:12:39,526
And you know what he did?

1643
01:12:39,592 --> 01:12:42,295
He broke my nose
in three places

1644
01:12:42,362 --> 01:12:44,297
and then threw me
      out of the house.

1645
01:12:46,099 --> 01:12:47,500
And after
      they fixed me up,

1646
01:12:47,567 --> 01:12:48,802
the hospital
      called my mother,

1647
01:12:48,868 --> 01:12:50,470
and she never showed.

1648
01:12:50,537 --> 01:12:53,039
Never even picked me up.

1649
01:12:53,106 --> 01:12:55,775
Maybe she was scared, Jules.

1650
01:12:55,842 --> 01:12:57,610
Maybe she was just as scared
as you

1651
01:12:57,677 --> 01:13:00,914
when she allowed those things
      to happen to you.

1652
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,816
She might have been happy
     when you ran away

1653
01:13:02,882 --> 01:13:07,420
because she knew
  he couldn't hurt you anymore.

1654
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:09,689
Maybe she loved you that much.

1655
01:13:09,756 --> 01:13:13,126
Why don't you call her?

1656
01:13:13,193 --> 01:13:15,762
I'm sure she'd love
      to hear from you.

1657
01:13:15,829 --> 01:13:17,430
I can't.

1658
01:13:17,497 --> 01:13:22,168
It's just a phone call, Jules.

01:19:21,628 --> 01:19:22,729
Excuse me.

1753
01:19:22,796 --> 01:19:24,597
I have rounds
to make.

1754
01:19:45,852 --> 01:19:47,721
[whispering]
      Charlie.

1755
01:19:47,787 --> 01:19:50,156
Oh, my God.

1756
01:19:50,223 --> 01:19:52,392
It is you.

1757
01:19:54,928 --> 01:19:57,797
[melodramatic music]

1758
01:19:57,864 --> 01:20:05,772
^^ ^^

1759
01:20:13,346 --> 01:20:14,948
Hey, Charlie.

1760
01:20:17,884 --> 01:20:24,858
^^ ^^

1761
01:20:24,924 --> 01:20:27,761
Charlie.

1762
01:20:27,827 --> 01:20:29,262
Hi.

1763
01:20:37,303 --> 01:20:38,672
It's okay.

1764
01:20:40,573 --> 01:20:42,742
I'm here now, Charlie.

1765
01:20:45,945 --> 01:20:48,615
You can leave now.

1766
01:20:48,682 --> 01:20:50,917
It's okay
to let go.

1767
01:21:01,828 --> 01:21:04,330
Look what
you forgot.

1768
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:20,113
^^ ^^

1769
01:21:20,180 --> 01:21:21,614
Thank you, Charlie.

1770
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,668
[knocking]

1771
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:21,641
Hi.

1772
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:23,777
Hi.

1773
01:22:25,211 --> 01:22:26,613
Can I come in?

1774
01:22:26,680 --> 01:22:29,215
Yeah, come on in.

1775
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:37,757
I thought I'd come by and...

1776
01:22:37,824 --> 01:22:40,060
give you your gift.

1777
01:22:42,262 --> 01:22:44,998
Where is it?

1778
01:22:50,503 --> 01:22:52,105
It's right here.

1779
01:23:01,181 --> 01:23:03,717
Merry Christmas, Mike.

1780
01:23:03,783 --> 01:23:06,786
Really?

1781
01:23:08,688 --> 01:23:10,724
Really?

1782
01:23:10,790 --> 01:23:13,026
Yeah.

1783
01:23:15,261 --> 01:23:16,930
Oh, I love you.

1784
01:23:16,996 --> 01:23:18,031
I love you.

1785
01:23:18,098 --> 01:23:19,666
So will you
      marry me now?

1786
01:23:19,733 --> 01:23:22,202
Yeah.

1787
01:23:22,268 --> 01:23:23,603
Let's get married.

1788
01:23:23,670 --> 01:23:25,305
Oh, my God.
  I missed you.

1789
01:23:25,372 --> 01:23:27,907
I love you
      so much.

1790
01:23:45,225 --> 01:23:46,960
So, Helen,
do you think your daughter

1791
01:23:47,027 --> 01:23:48,862
would go out
  to dinner with me?

1792
01:23:48,928 --> 01:23:50,597
You know,
  I was hoping

1793
01:23:50,663 --> 01:23:52,799
you might put in
    a good word for me.

1794
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:54,668
What do you think?

1795
01:23:54,734 --> 01:23:55,669
I'm a nice--

1796
01:23:55,735 --> 01:23:56,903
She's eating.

1797
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:59,673
Mom, you're eating.

1798
01:23:59,739 --> 01:24:01,307
That's so great.

1799
01:24:01,374 --> 01:24:04,010
Congratulations.

1800
01:24:04,077 --> 01:24:05,011
I was just--

1801
01:24:05,078 --> 01:24:06,880
You're talking,
I know that.

1802
01:24:06,946 --> 01:24:07,881
She's a great listener.

1803
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:09,616
Yes, she is.

1804
01:24:09,683 --> 01:24:11,818
I suppose I should
continue my rounds.

1805
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:13,019
Oh, Doctor.

1806
01:24:15,655 --> 01:24:17,557
What's your first name?

1807
01:24:19,626 --> 01:24:20,760
Matthew.

1808
01:24:20,827 --> 01:24:21,861
Matthew.

1809
01:24:21,928 --> 01:24:25,432
That's Matthew, Mom.

1810
01:24:25,498 --> 01:24:26,700
I'm sorry
  about what you heard

1811
01:24:26,766 --> 01:24:28,068
when I was talking
to your mother.

1812
01:24:30,003 --> 01:24:32,272
You know, as a doctor, you say
things to your patients that--

1813
01:24:32,339 --> 01:24:35,342
You don't really mean.

1814
01:24:35,408 --> 01:24:36,776
No, no,
    it's just that sometimes--

1815
01:24:36,843 --> 01:24:39,546
You don't...you don't want
  to take me to dinner.

1816
01:24:39,612 --> 01:24:40,547
No.

1817
01:24:40,613 --> 01:24:43,116
I mean yes.

1818
01:24:43,183 --> 01:24:44,684
I would like
to take you to dinner.

1819
01:24:46,419 --> 01:24:47,921
Oh.

1820
01:24:47,987 --> 01:24:49,889
Well, good,
because, uh...

1821
01:24:49,956 --> 01:24:53,126
Well, I think,
    I think that's a good idea.

1822
01:24:53,193 --> 01:24:54,627
Really?

1823
01:24:54,694 --> 01:24:57,764
Yes.

1824
01:24:57,831 --> 01:24:59,366
That's great.

1825
01:24:59,432 --> 01:25:01,034
I would really like that.

1826
01:25:01,101 --> 01:25:02,836
Me too.

1827
01:25:02,902 --> 01:25:04,671
Merry Christmas, Rose.

1828
01:25:04,738 --> 01:25:08,942
Merry Christmas, Matthew.

1829
01:25:11,177 --> 01:25:12,979
You too, Helen.

1830
01:25:15,015 --> 01:25:17,117
He seems like
  a good guy.

1831
01:25:17,183 --> 01:25:18,151
What do you think,
  Mother?

1832
01:25:18,218 --> 01:25:20,453
Do you like him?

1833
01:25:39,639 --> 01:25:43,143
Merry Christmas, Mom.

1834
01:25:46,413 --> 01:25:49,315
[uplifting music]

1835
01:25:49,382 --> 01:25:57,290
