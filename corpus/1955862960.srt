Since when?

26
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:56,682
You're no better than

27
00:01:58,984 --> 00:02:00,719
Look, can we just talk?

28
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,721
I know this has
been rough on you.

29
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,057
Do you?

30
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:07,859

31
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,094

So we'll start with the most
important room in the whole house.

37
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:31,083
This is the kitchen,

38
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:34,419
and it was completely remodeled
about five years ago.

39
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:37,789
And as you can see they put
in beautiful cherry cabinets,

40
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:42,327
that I love, and these cute
tile accents in the backsplash,

41
00:02:42,427 --> 00:02:44,329
and the, um...

42
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:48,467
open floor plan
for entertaining.

43
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:52,070
Uh... what else?

44
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,306
The neighborhood is wonderful,

45
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:56,274
and the schools are fantastic.

46
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:58,777
My daughter Dina plays for the
varsity field hockey team,

47
00:02:58,877 --> 00:03:01,346
and she just got
recruited by Price.

48
00:03:01,446 --> 00:03:02,981
I'm a proud mom, so I brag.

49
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,550
She got a scholarship
and everything.

50
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:07,886
Do you guys have kids?

51
00:03:13,058 --> 00:03:14,793
Mom?

52
00:03:43,722 --> 00:03:45,157
OK. Oh!

53
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,392
Damn it!

54
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,262
Damn it!

55
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:53,498
That's it.

56
00:03:56,068 --> 00:04:00,238
I wish I could just...

57
00:04:00,338 --> 00:04:02,741
fast forward my life.

58
00:04:02,841 --> 00:04:05,343
See how this all turns out.

59
00:04:05,444 --> 00:04:09,815
If I actually make it through.

60
00:04:14,386 --> 00:04:16,088
Stop dripping.

61
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:18,990
Anyway...

62
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:22,661
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

63
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:30,268
Dina?

64
00:04:30,368 --> 00:04:33,038
Hey, sweetie. I'm home.

65
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:35,073
Sorry, I know.

66
00:04:35,173 --> 00:04:36,942
I know, I'm late again.

67
00:04:37,042 --> 00:04:40,045
Thought I was gonna get
a speeding ticket.

68
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:42,814
I tried.

69
00:04:42,914 --> 00:04:44,282
Oh.

70
00:04:44,382 --> 00:04:46,284
You didn't want Chinese?

71
00:04:46,384 --> 00:04:49,588
Well, if you're lucky,
I'll cook pasta.

72
00:04:49,688 --> 00:04:53,759
If you're lucky, we can order
in from somewhere else.

73
00:04:54,226 --> 00:04:55,093
Sweetie?

74
00:04:55,193 --> 00:04:57,028
Oh, come on.

75
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,563
Dina!

76
00:04:58,663 --> 00:05:00,565
I'm starving.

77
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:32,964
Come on, girls.

78
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:41,606
That's it, stay together.
Work together.

79
00:05:41,706 --> 00:05:42,808
All right, Dina.

80
00:05:42,908 --> 00:05:44,676
Great shot!

81
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:47,212
That's what I'm talking about!
Nice!

82
00:05:47,312 --> 00:05:50,415
Good job, girls. Nice teamwork.

83
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:51,635
All right, let's line it up.

84
00:05:51,683 --> 00:05:53,652
Let's hustle!

85
00:05:57,022 --> 00:05:58,022
Sub!

86
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:00,091
Claire, you're up.

87
00:06:02,594 --> 00:06:04,062
You OK, Dina?

88
00:06:04,162 --> 00:06:06,565
Oh, fine. Just my ankle. I
just gotta re-tape it again.

89
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:08,166
- All right, good job.
- Thanks.

90
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:10,902
Let's line it up! Hustle!

91
00:06:22,047 --> 00:06:25,851
Owww!

92
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:40,398
Hi.

93
00:06:40,498 --> 00:06:42,634
- Hi, honey.
- Sorry I'm late.

94
00:06:42,734 --> 00:06:43,935
I rushed. All right.

95
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:45,503
- How we doing?
- It's a close game.

96
00:06:45,604 --> 00:06:47,014
It's 2-1, they're
playing really good,

97
00:06:47,038 --> 00:06:48,807
but this other
team is very good.

98
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:51,610
Oh, God, Skylar's playing great.

99
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,321
She is, she's kinda
keeping us in the game.

100
00:06:53,345 --> 00:06:54,613
She's killin' it.

101
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:55,780
Where's Dina?

102
00:06:55,881 --> 00:06:58,350
Oh, uh... she's on the bench.

103
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,818
- Ankle?
- Yep.

104
00:06:59,918 --> 00:07:02,621
Don't worry, they're taping it.

105
00:07:08,226 --> 00:07:10,862
Come on, Skylar!

106
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,430
Concentrate!

107
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,165
She's doing all right.

108
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:15,843
I spent all that money
on that summer clinic,

109
00:07:15,867 --> 00:07:17,936
and she cannot keep
her stick down.

110
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:21,640
Hey. Congratulations
about Price.

111
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,408
I'm really thrilled for her.

112
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:24,788
- It's a good thing.
- I am too.

113
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,444
It's good. It's so good.

114
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:27,784
How about Sky, how she's doing?

115
00:07:27,812 --> 00:07:30,482
- Oh. Make up your mind!
- Oh, she will.

116
00:07:30,582 --> 00:07:33,118
She will, but she's
taking her time

117
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,886
and it's making me a little...

118
00:07:34,986 --> 00:07:37,689
She's got time. Ah,
she's a good girl.

119
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,591
- Yeah, she does.
- Hey, Mrs. Reid.

120
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,526
Oh, my God, Mrs. V. Did
you see Dina's goal?

121
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:42,694
I did.

122
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,071
Mom, can we give
Claire a ride home?

123
00:07:44,095 --> 00:07:45,397
No. Yes, get in.

124
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:46,998
We always give her a ride home.

125
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:48,900
- Bye, Sky.
- - Good game, Sky.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,769
Thanks, you too. I'll
see you tomorrow.

127
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:52,637
Hey. I'm proud of you.

128
00:07:52,737 --> 00:07:54,973
Thanks, Mom.

129
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,982
Needless to say, this has
been a difficult year.

130
00:08:04,082 --> 00:08:07,852
But for our team, a
very successful one.

131
00:08:07,953 --> 00:08:10,989
Twelve and three.
And the league MVP,

132
00:08:11,089 --> 00:08:12,824
Skylar Reid.

133
00:08:15,293 --> 00:08:16,294
Congratulations.

134
00:08:16,394 --> 00:08:17,963
- Well done.
- Thanks.

135
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:25,136
And congrats on your early
acceptance to Price as well,

136
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:26,771
that is very good news.

137
00:08:26,871 --> 00:08:31,376
Now I would like to award the
individual varsity letters.

138
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:35,647
If there's anything you need.
I mean...

139
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:36,747
Anything at all.

140
00:08:39,584 --> 00:08:41,019
First, I would like to award

141
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:43,254
a posthumous varsity letter.

142
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,923
To Dina Van Cleve.

143
00:08:45,023 --> 00:08:48,460
Her mother, Rachel, is here
to receive Dina's letter.

144
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:19,624
Rachel. Hang on for a sec.

145
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:24,195
I'm sorry, this was too soon.

146
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:26,798
The team wanted
you to have this.

147
00:09:26,898 --> 00:09:30,035
Skylar had all the girls
sign their names.

148
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:32,170
Oh, sweetie.

149
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:36,074
I am so sorry.

150
00:09:38,143 --> 00:09:40,478
If there's anything
that I can do...

151
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:45,350

My friend, Claire...

176
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:22,046
she always flips to the last page
of the book before she reads it.

177
00:11:22,147 --> 00:11:26,017
She says she doesn't want to
waste her time on a story

178
00:11:26,117 --> 00:11:29,487
if it ends badly.

179
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:33,258
I guess she'd tell
me to start there.

180
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:35,894
She would...

181
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:39,264

I've spent the past
few weeks being...

183
00:11:46,771 --> 00:11:49,407
absolutely tortured

184
00:11:49,507 --> 00:11:54,112
by the people that I
used to call my friends.

185
00:11:54,212 --> 00:11:57,448
They...

186
00:11:57,549 --> 00:12:01,052
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

187
00:12:12,997 --> 00:12:15,333
North Carolina?

188
00:12:24,609 --> 00:12:25,910
Jealous, Van Cleve?

189
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,879
It's better in high res.

190
00:12:27,979 --> 00:12:29,581
Who is this?

191
00:12:29,681 --> 00:12:31,049
Hello?

192
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:32,660
Do you think it's funny
sending filth like this

193
00:12:32,684 --> 00:12:35,186
- to my daughter's phone?
- What? No, I...

194
00:12:35,286 --> 00:12:37,255
Who is this? What is your name?

195
00:12:37,355 --> 00:12:38,957
- Valerie.
- Valerie who?

196
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,559
I played field hockey
with Dina last year.

197
00:12:41,659 --> 00:12:43,127
Look, Mrs. Van Cleve,

198
00:12:43,228 --> 00:12:45,797
Dina didn't know I was gonna
send her that, I swear.

199
00:12:45,897 --> 00:12:48,666
So, please don't be mad at her.

200
00:12:48,766 --> 00:12:50,368
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

201
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:53,972
Could you just let her know
that I'm back in town.

202
00:12:57,075 --> 00:12:58,509
We should talk.

203
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:01,913
Oh, my God.

204
00:13:02,013 --> 00:13:04,382
I had no idea.

205
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:09,687
I think... Dina was
being harassed

206
00:13:09,787 --> 00:13:11,956
at school before she died.

207
00:13:12,056 --> 00:13:13,658
So when I saw the
picture you sent,

208
00:13:13,758 --> 00:13:16,628
I automatically assumed it was you.
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:17,962
Of course.

210
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:20,298
God, I feel like such an idiot.

211
00:13:21,299 --> 00:13:23,801
Did she ever say
anything to you?

212
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:27,305
About feeling like she was
being bullied at school?

213
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:30,208
We haven't talked in awhile.

214
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,710
I just got back from a
semester in South Africa.

215
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,380
I've been unplugged for months.

216
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,749
Are you close with
any of her friends?

217
00:13:37,849 --> 00:13:39,083
Not really.

218
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:42,287
I mean, I know some of
them from the team.

219
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:47,158
I want to understand

220
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:49,494
what she went through.

221
00:13:49,594 --> 00:13:51,996
But honestly, I...

222
00:13:52,096 --> 00:13:53,631
I don't even know
where to start.

223
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:56,100
Have you tried looking online?

224
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,370
I mean, if she had a falling
out with her friends

225
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,173
it's probably
catalogued somewhere.

226
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,975
These days, most dirty laundry

227
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:05,576
is offered up for
public consumption.

228
00:14:05,677 --> 00:14:08,880
Would I still be able to
find it after all this time?

229
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:11,883
The Internet never forgets.

230
00:14:11,983 --> 00:14:16,421
When was the first time you
thought something might be wrong?

231
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:17,955
Homecoming.

232
00:14:18,056 --> 00:14:20,425
- OK, everybody get together.
- - Everybody smile.

233
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:22,827
- Skylar, honey, stand up straight.
- - Bigger teeth.

234
00:14:22,927 --> 00:14:25,496
- All right. Oh, God, they're beautiful.
- They're stunning.

235
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:27,975
- One, two, three.
- - Wait, you guys get in a little closer.

236
00:14:27,999 --> 00:14:30,668
Homecoming!

237
00:14:30,768 --> 00:14:31,969
- Smile!
- Big smiles.

238
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,138
Perfect.

239
00:14:34,238 --> 00:14:35,773
- Good?
- Done yet?

240
00:14:35,873 --> 00:14:37,041
Very pretty.

241
00:14:37,141 --> 00:14:39,510
- Get outta here!
- Have a great time.

242
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,046
Wait, wait.

243
00:14:42,146 --> 00:14:43,948
You look beautiful.

244
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,583
Thank you very much.

245
00:14:45,683 --> 00:14:48,720
Now, can you fit everything you
need in that little bitty purse?

246
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,054
Like money and ID?

247
00:14:50,154 --> 00:14:53,958
Well, I am not driving
and I can't buy alcohol.

248
00:14:54,058 --> 00:14:56,160
Or drink yet.

249
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,363
So, listen, I went
to high school once.

250
00:14:58,463 --> 00:15:00,064
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:15:00,164 --> 00:15:02,533
And I know that there's
a lot of pressure

252
00:15:02,633 --> 00:15:03,534
on a night like tonight.

253
00:15:03,634 --> 00:15:06,938
And people have... wait.

254
00:15:07,038 --> 00:15:09,540
People have expectations,

255
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,518
and I'm just trying to tell
you that you don't ever,

256
00:15:11,542 --> 00:15:14,679
ever have to do anything you're not
100 percent comfortable doing.

257
00:15:14,779 --> 00:15:16,714
Like the Electric Slide?

258
00:15:18,282 --> 00:15:20,485
- Come on, Mama, you can save the PSA.
- Mm-hmm.

259
00:15:20,585 --> 00:15:22,787
It's just gonna be some
friends hanging out.

260
00:15:22,887 --> 00:15:26,457
Making a lifetime of memories.

261
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:29,293
- Good, clean fun.
- Love you.

262
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:30,394
- Love you too.
- Bye.

263
00:15:30,461 --> 00:15:32,130
- Bye.
- Have fun.

264
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:33,574
- OK, one more, one more.
- Take a picture.

265
00:15:33,598 --> 00:15:35,299
Pretty.

266
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:40,638

Nothing.

273
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:14,739
Can we just slow down for a sec?

274
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,508
How slow are we talking?

275
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:21,746

I'm sorry.

277

You said Homecoming

- I know, I...
- I got you flowers.

279
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:32,123
I got us this room at
the Beechwood, which...

280
00:16:32,223 --> 00:16:33,057
wasn't cheap.

So, now what?

285
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:50,274
Maybe you should
just take me home.

286
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:57,582
You know, it's not
that big of a deal.

287
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:59,317
Yeah, well...

288
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,519

and you're home before midnight.

295
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,591
Yeah, the dance ended at ten.

296
00:17:40,691 --> 00:17:44,028
Rest of the night was
kinda uneventful.

297
00:17:44,128 --> 00:17:46,397
- Sweetie?
- Yeah?

298
00:17:46,497 --> 00:17:48,132

Yeah.

300
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:51,802
That's fantastic!
Congratulations.

301
00:17:51,903 --> 00:17:54,005
It's not that big
of a deal, Mom.

302
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:55,139
It is a big deal.

303
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,416
Oh, my God. When I was your age,

304
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,075
it was like the
biggest deal ever.

305
00:17:58,175 --> 00:18:01,012
Seriously, they had
posters and pins

306
00:18:01,112 --> 00:18:02,446
and cupcake bribes.

307
00:18:02,547 --> 00:18:04,882
I swear, it was like a
presidential election.

308
00:18:04,982 --> 00:18:08,819
Except possibly for the cupcake
part cause that would be odd.

309
00:18:09,921 --> 00:18:12,223
So, something happened
with Mark, didn't it?

310
00:18:12,323 --> 00:18:13,891
Why would you say that?

311
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:16,294
I can tell.

312
00:18:17,195 --> 00:18:18,763
Did you...

313
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:20,197
You know.

314
00:18:20,298 --> 00:18:23,668
Mom, no!

315
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,503
You can talk to me
about stuff like that.

316
00:18:25,603 --> 00:18:27,884
Well, I don't want to talk to
you about my sex life, so...

317
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:30,208
Are you telling me that
you have a sex life?

318
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:32,176
No, that's not what I'm saying,

319
00:18:32,276 --> 00:18:33,311
I just...

320
00:18:33,411 --> 00:18:34,912
Will you please just get out?

321
00:18:35,012 --> 00:18:36,080
OK, I'm going.

322
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,883

Yes, I know.

00:23:09,353 --> 00:23:11,856
OK, OK, just breathe.
Dina, Dina, breathe.

361
00:23:11,956 --> 00:23:13,490
OK, we can figure
this out together.

362
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:16,026
We can figure it out.

363
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:19,630
Oh, God.

364
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,372
- I need a pen.
- What?

365
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:30,574
I need a pen!

366
00:23:54,598 --> 00:23:55,966
How could you do that to me?

367
00:23:56,066 --> 00:23:58,502
I thought we meant
something to each other.

368
00:23:58,602 --> 00:24:00,638
- Shouldn't that be my line?
- Excuse me?

369
00:24:00,738 --> 00:24:02,115
First you blow me off at
Homecoming and now this?

370
00:24:02,139 --> 00:24:03,874
I don't get you.

371
00:24:03,974 --> 00:24:06,677
No, no. I sent that picture
to you and you alone,

372
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,379
and now it is all
over the school.

373
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,024
I just saw it this morning when a
bunch of people showed it to me.

374
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:13,651
Stop lying. Seriously, why
did you send it out...

375
00:24:13,751 --> 00:24:16,887
Dina. I got a new
wallpaper today.

376
00:24:16,987 --> 00:24:19,390
You know, it's really hot.

377
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:23,193
I'm thinking I should send
it in to Sexysexters.com.

378
00:24:23,294 --> 00:24:25,596
What do you think?

379
00:24:34,805 --> 00:24:38,776
Oh, God...

380
00:24:38,876 --> 00:24:41,645
I'd like the opportunity to speak
with each of these students.

381
00:24:41,745 --> 00:24:43,425
I have some questions
for them about Dina.

382
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,550
And you think they'll be
able to give you answers?

383
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,088
Yeah, well as founding members of the
"Dina Van Cleve is a Slut" Facebook page,

384
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,657
I'm thinking they
might have a few.

385
00:24:58,862 --> 00:25:00,998
Katie Bishop.

386
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,333
Michael Hatcher.

387
00:25:02,433 --> 00:25:05,135
Peter Lambert.

388
00:25:10,741 --> 00:25:13,243
I can't help you.

389
00:25:14,278 --> 00:25:16,280
You can't help me, or
you won't help me?

390
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,116
Can't. They don't
go to school here.

391
00:25:19,216 --> 00:25:21,485
Of course they go to school
here, how can they not?

392
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:24,288
Dummy accounts.

393
00:25:24,388 --> 00:25:26,924
It's common with cyber bullying.
It's a way to remain anonymous.

394
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:31,028
OK... Well, you monitor computer
activity in the school, right?

395
00:25:31,128 --> 00:25:33,030
Can't I tell who had
access to the page?

396
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,598
Mrs. Van Cleve,

397
00:25:34,698 --> 00:25:38,502
what is it that you're
hoping to do with this?

398
00:25:38,602 --> 00:25:43,073
These kids hurt my daughter.

399
00:25:43,173 --> 00:25:45,809
I want to know why they did it,
I want to know who it was.

400
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:50,280
Dina's death was a tragedy.

401
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:53,884
And we all want closure.

402
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:59,957
But I can't have you turning
my school upside down.

403
00:26:00,057 --> 00:26:04,561
If you need something,
you get it through me.

404
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:08,866
Fine. Good. I need the ISP
records from the computer labs.

405
00:26:08,966 --> 00:26:13,037
You won't find anything there.

406
00:26:14,304 --> 00:26:18,342
Mrs. Van Cleve, please. Think
about what you are doing.

407
00:26:18,442 --> 00:26:22,212
This is a can of worms
you do not want to open.

408
00:26:25,215 --> 00:26:27,651
Um, I'm here if
you want to talk.

409
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:29,353
Oh, are you?

410
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:47,871
Mark, hi.

411
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:50,274
Can I talk to you
for just a second?

412
00:26:50,374 --> 00:26:53,677
Yeah, um, but I only have a few
minutes until my next class.

413
00:26:53,777 --> 00:26:55,813
It's OK. It's all right.

414
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:03,087
What do you know about this?

415
00:27:05,456 --> 00:27:07,891
Did Dina send it to you?

416
00:27:10,694 --> 00:27:11,929
Yeah, she did.

417
00:27:12,029 --> 00:27:13,564
Who did you send it to?

418
00:27:13,664 --> 00:27:14,932
No one.

419
00:27:15,032 --> 00:27:17,334
You're trying to tell me
that nobody saw this?

420
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:21,405
Who did you send it to?

421
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:24,608
Look, I didn't do it. And I
don't know anything about it.

422
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:26,152
Mark, please, I know
you care about her.

423
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:28,178
Please tell me how this got out.

424
00:27:29,646 --> 00:27:32,683
Look, I'm sorry about Dina.

425
00:27:32,783 --> 00:27:34,785
I really am.

426
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:37,554
I don't know what to tell you.

427
00:27:37,654 --> 00:27:40,390
I'm late for my class.

428
00:27:52,402 --> 00:27:54,471
Claire.

429
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:56,507
Hi, Mrs. V.

430
00:27:56,607 --> 00:27:59,409
Hi. Hi.

431
00:28:01,145 --> 00:28:02,813
I wanted to talk to
you for a second.

432
00:28:02,913 --> 00:28:05,582
If I can, about something.
Is that all right?

433
00:28:05,682 --> 00:28:09,486
Sure... What?

434
00:28:09,586 --> 00:28:13,390
I want you to help me understand
why Dina did what she did.

435
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,058
Oh, Mrs. V.

436
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:17,194
I really miss her. But...

437
00:28:17,294 --> 00:28:22,866
I found a video that Dina
was making on the computer.

438
00:28:22,966 --> 00:28:27,037
And in it, she talks pretty
intimately about what was

439
00:28:27,137 --> 00:28:28,739
going on at school
before she died.

440
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,242
This video seemed like it was the
last in a series she was making.

441
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:36,246
Like it was some kind
of diary or something.

442
00:28:36,346 --> 00:28:37,881
Do you know anything about this?

443
00:28:37,981 --> 00:28:41,718
Sure, I knew that she
made a few of those.

444
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,288
Sometimes she'd even post
them online and stuff,

445
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,523
depending on what
she had to say.

446
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:49,126
Where can I find them?

447
00:28:49,226 --> 00:28:54,698
She took down her page a
few days before she...

448
00:28:54,798 --> 00:28:56,533
Before.

449
00:28:56,633 --> 00:28:59,403
Claire?

450
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,140
Please help me with this.

451
00:29:05,275 --> 00:29:07,844
Dina...

452
00:29:07,945 --> 00:29:09,913
Well, she wouldn't talk to me.

453
00:29:10,013 --> 00:29:12,082
About what she was
going through.

454
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:17,054
I really feel like she
wanted to protect me.

455
00:29:17,154 --> 00:29:21,925
But, if she confided
in those videos...

456
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:24,661
I need to see them.

457
00:29:24,761 --> 00:29:26,163
I need to understand this.

458
00:29:26,263 --> 00:29:30,601
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:30,701 --> 00:29:33,403
Why weren't the two of
you speaking, Claire?

460
00:29:33,503 --> 00:29:36,039
I don't know what...

461
00:29:36,139 --> 00:29:39,142
She talked about
it in the video.

462
00:29:39,243 --> 00:29:42,112
Some dumb fight, I guess.

463
00:29:42,212 --> 00:29:44,781
I don't remember.

464
00:29:44,882 --> 00:29:46,917
What else does she say?

465
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:52,322
If you think of anywhere I
might be able to find them,

466
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,858
will you call me?
Will you do that?

467
00:29:54,958 --> 00:29:57,527
I'm gonna keep
looking on my end.

468
00:30:18,415 --> 00:30:20,217
Claire, seriously?

469
00:30:20,317 --> 00:30:22,719
Can you get, like a poker
face or something?

470
00:30:22,819 --> 00:30:24,154
I don't even know
what that means.

471
00:30:24,254 --> 00:30:26,390
Oh, my God. OK. It means
this is really important

472
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,558
so I'm going to need you
to pull it together.

473
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,929
OK.

474
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:36,133
Claire. I'm trusting you.

475
00:30:36,233 --> 00:30:37,901
I got it covered, OK?

476
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:03,960
Hi.

477
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:05,796
Hi, Mrs. V.

478
00:31:05,896 --> 00:31:10,334
I thought I'd come see if we can
find any more of Dina's vlogs.

479
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:12,936
Thank you.

480
00:31:13,036 --> 00:31:15,005
My friend, Claire...

481
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:19,376
she always flips to the last page
of the book before she reads it.

482
00:31:19,476 --> 00:31:23,013
She says she doesn't want to
waste her time on a story

483
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:24,381
if it ends badly.

484
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:27,718
I guess she'd tell
me to start there.

485
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:30,120
She would...

486
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,123
if we were still speaking.

487
00:31:36,193 --> 00:31:40,897
I've spent the past
few weeks being...

488
00:31:40,998 --> 00:31:42,933
absolutely tortured

489
00:31:43,033 --> 00:31:47,704
by the people that I
used to call my friends.

490
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:49,206
They...

491
00:31:49,306 --> 00:31:54,111
I can't... I can't
do this right now.

492
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:00,384
It's not easy to watch, is it?

493
00:32:00,484 --> 00:32:03,887
I've seen it so many
times, I think I'm numb.

494
00:32:03,987 --> 00:32:06,823
Who's she talking about, Claire?

495
00:32:09,593 --> 00:32:12,062
I don't know.

496
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:14,664
I've seen the text.

497
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:22,806
I'll dig around on there
and see what I can find.

498
00:32:22,906 --> 00:32:25,876
OK. I'll be right back.

499
00:32:25,976 --> 00:32:27,677
Thank you.

500
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:43,827
Hi, may I please speak
to Bob Montgomery?

501
00:32:45,462 --> 00:32:48,565
Bob, hi, my name is
Rachel Van Cleve.

502
00:32:48,665 --> 00:32:51,401
And I wrote an article about
bullying in our high school

503
00:32:51,501 --> 00:32:53,737
and how I think the
administration is covering it up.

504
00:32:53,837 --> 00:32:58,608
And I think it would make a
really good op-ed piece.

505
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:02,612
Great, OK. I'll proof it and
then I'll send it over.

506
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:04,881
OK.

507
00:33:04,981 --> 00:33:06,716
Thanks. Bye.

508
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:23,467
Did you find anything?

509
00:33:24,101 --> 00:33:25,635
No, nothing.

510
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:27,904
I searched the
entire hard drive.

511
00:33:28,004 --> 00:33:30,340
I did too.

512
00:33:31,508 --> 00:33:33,410
Why would she do this?

513
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:36,346
Why would she just
leave one file?

514
00:33:36,446 --> 00:33:39,449
So, you have seen this?

515
00:33:39,549 --> 00:33:43,487
Yeah, I have. I'm sorry I
didn't say anything before.

516
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:47,824
It's just... I wanted to
protect Dina, I guess.

517
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:49,926
Who sent it to you?

518
00:33:50,026 --> 00:33:52,462
I got it from my friend Sarah
who goes to Greenleaf.

519
00:33:52,562 --> 00:33:54,698
I guess she and Dina
were at an all-star camp

520
00:33:54,798 --> 00:33:56,366
this Fall or something.

521
00:33:57,267 --> 00:33:58,568
Hey! I know you.

522
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,971
You go to Westfield, right?

523
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:02,906
No, sorry.

524
00:34:03,006 --> 00:34:05,242
What are you, undercover?

525
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,043
It says it right on
your water bottle.

526
00:34:07,143 --> 00:34:08,512
I'm totally great with faces.

527
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:10,347
Anyway, I was at the
Covington game.

528
00:34:10,447 --> 00:34:12,215
You got a great shot.

529
00:34:12,315 --> 00:34:14,251
Oh. Thanks.

530
00:34:14,351 --> 00:34:16,186
Sorry, I'm Sarah. Midfielder.

531
00:34:16,286 --> 00:34:18,388
- Dina.
- And this is Karen.

532
00:34:18,488 --> 00:34:19,632
She's a forward for Evanston.

533
00:34:19,656 --> 00:34:21,391
- Heading to check in?
- Yeah.

534
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:24,361
- It's right there. See ya.
- Thank you.

535
00:34:26,496 --> 00:34:29,266
Hey! Uh, Dina Van Cleve?

536
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,811
All right! Nice job, Dina!

537
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:48,418
Sarah wasn't kidding
about your shot.

538
00:34:48,518 --> 00:34:50,887
- Oh, thanks.
- I'm going to go grab a drink, want one?

539
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,589
Yeah, sure.

540
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:02,132
- She's right over there.
- Oh, my God.

541
00:35:02,232 --> 00:35:05,101
- Is that Dina?
- Oh, my God!

542
00:35:05,201 --> 00:35:06,336
No way...

543
00:35:23,954 --> 00:35:25,722
What happened?

544
00:35:27,157 --> 00:35:29,593
- Delete it.
- Oh, come on.

545
00:35:31,661 --> 00:35:33,263
God, I was blind.

546
00:35:33,363 --> 00:35:36,399
She seemed genuinely excited
to go to that camp,

547
00:35:36,499 --> 00:35:38,235
and then she came back
a different person.

548
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:40,103
I didn't even notice.

549
00:35:40,203 --> 00:35:43,807
If all the kids at camp saw it.

550
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:45,909
How far did it spread?

551
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:49,179
It definitely went viral.

552
00:35:49,279 --> 00:35:51,114
It's probably everywhere.

553
00:35:51,214 --> 00:35:53,717
The mood is tense here this
morning at Westfield High,

554
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:56,519
and nobody knows exactly
what will go on here today.

555
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,989
The administration
is on high alert

556
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:00,812
and parents are being
brought in on the

557
00:36:00,824 --> 00:36:02,559
investigation into the
death of Dina Van Cleve

558
00:36:02,659 --> 00:36:05,962
will be underway and the police will
have a presence at this school,

559
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:09,266
as the details of her tragic
death are looked into.

560
00:36:09,366 --> 00:36:11,201
Rachel Van Cleve,
who's daughter Dina

561
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:14,971
tragically took her own life,
has written a scathing article

562
00:36:15,071 --> 00:36:18,708
that was published today
in the Daily Exchange...

563
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:29,519
Hey... Um, so, do you know what's going
on with all the reporters outside?

564
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:31,921
They're here for
student reactions.

565
00:36:32,022 --> 00:36:34,724
- To what?
- Dina's mom wrote an article.

566
00:36:34,824 --> 00:36:36,459
Some news affiliates
picked it up.

567
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:38,428
What are you talking about?

568
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:40,330
"Bullying in our schools."

569
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:41,765
OK.

570
00:36:41,865 --> 00:36:44,501
Wait, she actually wants
a police investigation?

571
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:46,302
She wants someone to blame.

572
00:36:46,403 --> 00:36:49,806
OK. But, you don't think the police
would really get involved, right?

573
00:36:49,906 --> 00:36:53,610
I mean, Dina did kill herself.

574
00:37:01,351 --> 00:37:03,653
"Where's the community's
allegiance?

575
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:05,789
Is it behind the teenage
girl who was bullied

576
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:08,858
and tormented to the point
of taking her own life?

577
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:11,594
Or, behind the
spit-shined reputations

578
00:37:11,695 --> 00:37:16,066
of the rest of the scholarship-greedy,
college bound, student body?

579
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:21,004
This is criminal behavior and
it should not be tolerated..."

580
00:37:21,104 --> 00:37:22,439
And it goes on.

581
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:25,775
I know, I know, she's
so angry, but...

582
00:37:25,875 --> 00:37:30,447
I think that a lot of people are
going to be really angry about this.

583
00:37:34,551 --> 00:37:35,819
- Hi.
- Hi.

584
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:37,921
- How was your day?
- Weird.

585
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,656
There were cops and
reporters everywhere

586
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,224
when I got to school
this morning.

587
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:42,859
Why?

588
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,937
They're making a federal case out
of that whole bullying thing.

589
00:37:44,961 --> 00:37:47,097
That's ridiculous.

590
00:37:47,197 --> 00:37:50,533
I don't know. Everyone seems,
like, super freaked out.

591
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:53,770
- Are you?
- No.

592
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:55,538
I mean...

593
00:37:55,638 --> 00:37:58,441
I kind of said some stuff to
her after that text came out.

594
00:37:58,541 --> 00:38:00,110
Yeah, but you were
just kidding, right?

595
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,245
- Yeah...
- I mean, it's high school

596
00:38:02,345 --> 00:38:03,646
it's what people do.

597
00:38:03,747 --> 00:38:07,117
- Everybody needs to relax.
- I guess.

598
00:38:07,217 --> 00:38:08,685
OK? Don't even think about it.

599
00:38:08,785 --> 00:38:09,986
OK.

600
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:26,936
OK.

601
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:37,480
- Did you know Dina Van Cleve?
- Uh, I... I can't really talk about it.

602
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,816
Did something happen at
school the day she died?

603
00:38:39,916 --> 00:38:41,684
Did somebody say
anything to her?

604
00:38:41,785 --> 00:38:44,587
Or harass her in anyway?

605
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,625
Please, Byron...

606
00:38:48,725 --> 00:38:50,302
Seriously, any tiny
bit of information...

607
00:38:50,326 --> 00:38:53,663
I'm sorry, but you're
wasting your time.

608
00:38:56,866 --> 00:38:58,268
OK.

609
00:38:58,368 --> 00:39:01,104
Hey, I don't mean with me.

610
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:03,306
I mean here. At the school.

611
00:39:03,406 --> 00:39:05,975
You're not going to
find anyone here

612
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,011
who's going to give you
what you're looking for.

613
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,779
And we're under a
lot of pressure

614
00:39:09,879 --> 00:39:12,215
from the administration
to keep an even keel.

615
00:39:12,315 --> 00:39:14,260
I'm sorry, I don't have any
idea what you're talking about.

616
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:18,188
I'm saying parents can be very
protective of their kids.

617
00:39:18,288 --> 00:39:21,825
Especially when it seems like
someone is intent on hurting them.

618
00:39:21,925 --> 00:39:24,194
And you didn't help
things with that article

619
00:39:24,294 --> 00:39:25,762
that you wrote in the paper.

620
00:39:25,862 --> 00:39:28,140
Where were these parents when
my daughter was being bullied?

621
00:39:28,164 --> 00:39:32,702
- Kids can be cruel.
- And adults should know better.

622
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:35,839
Rachel?

623
00:39:35,939 --> 00:39:38,675
May I speak with
you in my office?

624
00:39:46,549 --> 00:39:50,186
The school made a lot of
mistakes when it came to Dina.

625
00:39:50,286 --> 00:39:53,556
But, maybe we can do
something to prevent another

626
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:55,592
tragedy from happening
in the future.

627
00:39:55,692 --> 00:39:58,261
I'm starting a
school-wide campaign,

628
00:39:58,361 --> 00:40:00,763
and a discussion group
called, "Kindness Matters."

629
00:40:00,864 --> 00:40:04,334
It'll be a safe zone where kids can talk
about the pressures they are feeling

630
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:07,070
and get some support
from their peers.

631
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:10,707
These kids tortured my
daughter for weeks.

632
00:40:10,807 --> 00:40:14,410
They don't need a club.
They need to be punished.

633
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,616
We can't change what's
happened to Dina.

634
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:24,254
But, maybe we can use it to make a
real difference for someone else.

635
00:40:24,354 --> 00:40:28,324
The administration put you
up to this, didn't they?

636
00:40:28,424 --> 00:40:30,827
They want to distract me.

637
00:40:30,927 --> 00:40:33,296
They want to shut me up,
is what they want to do.

638
00:40:33,396 --> 00:40:35,732
I'm doing this for you, Rachel.

639
00:40:35,832 --> 00:40:39,269
I want to help you. I
want you to trust me.

640
00:40:39,369 --> 00:40:42,372
I did trust you.

641
00:40:42,472 --> 00:40:44,741
I trusted you with my daughter.

642
00:41:18,141 --> 00:41:19,509
Mrs. Van Cleve.

643
00:41:19,609 --> 00:41:22,946
I can not have you continually
harassing my students and faculty.

644
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,949
You have got to be kidding me.
I'm not harassing anybody.

645
00:41:26,049 --> 00:41:28,017
Please stop this witch hunt.

646
00:41:28,117 --> 00:41:30,053
How often do you go into
the girls restroom?

647
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:31,254
Well, I don't...

648
00:41:31,354 --> 00:41:33,198
You are either completely
incompetent at your job

649
00:41:33,222 --> 00:41:34,624
or you are covering
for these kids.

650
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:36,292
And honestly, I
can't decide which.

651
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:38,594
But, either way, I'm not going
to stop asking questions

652
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:40,039
until I find the answers
I'm looking for.

653
00:41:40,063 --> 00:41:41,731
- Well, I can't help you.
- Yes, I know.

654
00:41:41,831 --> 00:41:43,666
You've made that
abundantly clear.

655
00:41:43,766 --> 00:41:45,568
I'll go over your
head if I have to.

656
00:41:45,668 --> 00:41:47,603
Fine.

657
00:41:47,704 --> 00:41:51,107
Somebody is going to be held
accountable for my daughter's death.

658
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,902
Hi. Hi.

659
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,437
I am so sorry I'm late.

660
00:42:21,537 --> 00:42:22,817
Look, I'll save you the apology.

661
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,841
We decided to go in a
different direction.

662
00:42:24,941 --> 00:42:26,776
A different direction?

663
00:42:26,876 --> 00:42:28,711
We signed with Foster-Healey
this morning.

664
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:30,413
They're going to represent us.

665
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:33,783
No, please. I mean, I know
that I've been unavailable...

666
00:42:33,883 --> 00:42:37,186
Frankly, Rachel, no one
will touch the house

667
00:42:37,286 --> 00:42:38,286
if you're selling it.

668
00:42:38,354 --> 00:42:39,922
Who told you that?

669
00:42:40,023 --> 00:42:43,059
Bill's employer wants him
in Atlanta in a month.

670
00:42:43,159 --> 00:42:45,361
We just can't afford to have
this idle on the market.

671
00:42:45,461 --> 00:42:47,163
I'm sorry.

672
00:43:19,562 --> 00:43:21,998
Oh, my God.

673
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:44,520
You didn't see anything?

674
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,489
No, nothing.

675
00:43:46,589 --> 00:43:49,158
Somebody must have dropped these
off, they don't have postmarks.

676
00:43:49,258 --> 00:43:51,994
Oh... I'm sorry, I
didn't anything.

677
00:43:52,095 --> 00:43:53,896
I've been in and out all day...

678
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:55,832
There was nothing unusual?

679
00:43:55,932 --> 00:43:59,235
No strange cars...

680
00:43:59,335 --> 00:44:02,805
- Define strange cars?
- I don't know...

681
00:44:02,905 --> 00:44:04,607
- Oh...

682
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:06,442
Excuse me.

683
00:44:07,443 --> 00:44:08,978
Hello?

684
00:44:09,412 --> 00:44:11,514
What?

685
00:44:11,614 --> 00:44:14,217
No. No, no, no. I'll
be right there.

686
00:44:14,317 --> 00:44:16,252
I have to go.

687
00:44:23,693 --> 00:44:27,263
Oh, no...

688
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:32,034
No... no...

689
00:44:55,491 --> 00:44:58,227
Who did this?

690
00:44:59,662 --> 00:45:00,897
I don't know.

691
00:45:00,997 --> 00:45:03,199
I don't believe you. Who
are you protecting?

692
00:45:03,299 --> 00:45:06,702
No one. I just came here
to pay my respects.

693
00:45:06,802 --> 00:45:08,304
You don't respect her.

694
00:45:08,404 --> 00:45:10,473
If you did, none of
this would've happened.

695
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:13,843
Look, you weren't the
only one who lost her...

696
00:45:13,943 --> 00:45:15,478
Who loved her.

697
00:45:15,578 --> 00:45:18,080
If you love her, then you
will tell me the truth.

698
00:45:18,181 --> 00:45:20,483
Did you send the text?

699
00:45:20,583 --> 00:45:23,653
Did you want to seem like a
big man to all your friends?

700
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:26,189
- No, it wasn't like that.
- Then by all means, Mark.

701
00:45:26,289 --> 00:45:28,496
You tell me what it was
like, because I sure

702
00:45:28,508 --> 00:45:30,726
as hell can't get anybody
else to talk to me.

703
00:45:30,826 --> 00:45:33,296
She sent the text to you.

704
00:45:33,396 --> 00:45:35,298
Who else possibly could
have forwarded it?

705
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:38,901
I swear, I didn't
forward it to anyone.

706
00:45:39,001 --> 00:45:42,805
You're just a coward.

707
00:45:42,905 --> 00:45:45,174
You're just like
the rest of them.

708
00:48:27,303 --> 00:48:29,405
Hello, Rachel.

709
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:32,308
I just stopped by to
let you know that

710
00:48:32,408 --> 00:48:34,119
Mark Carey was arrested
at school this morning

711
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:36,445
for suspected distribution
of child pornography.

712
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:39,048
Is that really what you wanted?

713
00:48:39,148 --> 00:48:42,618
They've released Mark on
his own recognizance.

714
00:48:42,718 --> 00:48:44,453
Apparently, he swears
he received the text,

715
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:45,955
but he didn't do
anything with it.

716
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:47,332
He was too embarrassed for Dina.

717
00:48:47,356 --> 00:48:48,858
He said it was a personal thing.

718
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:51,160
The text came from his phone.

719
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:53,529
Even if he didn't do it, don't
you think he knows who did?

720
00:48:53,629 --> 00:48:55,231
I don't know.

721
00:48:55,331 --> 00:48:56,875
The police are still working
on getting the phone records.

722
00:48:56,899 --> 00:48:58,300
Good.

723
00:48:58,401 --> 00:49:00,212
Principal Brannigan and I have
been inundated with calls

724
00:49:00,236 --> 00:49:02,838
from irate parents saying
this has gone way too far.

725
00:49:04,006 --> 00:49:06,442
Is that what this
is actually about?

726
00:49:06,542 --> 00:49:07,810
I don't care.

727
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,979
I don't care about the parents.

728
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:11,981
All I care about is finding
out what happened,

729
00:49:12,081 --> 00:49:13,258
but these kids are
hiding something.

730
00:49:13,282 --> 00:49:14,817
I know it, and you know it too.

731
00:49:14,917 --> 00:49:16,719
OK. I understand.

732
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:19,722
But you do understand that even
if somebody deliberately sent

733
00:49:19,822 --> 00:49:23,292
Dina's text viral, you can't
blame them for what Dina did.

734
00:49:23,392 --> 00:49:26,629
She had a choice.

735
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:33,702
I want the cell phone records.

736
00:49:40,109 --> 00:49:41,644
Claire.

737
00:49:42,711 --> 00:49:44,947
Claire.

738
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:47,716
I, I can't be seen with you.

739
00:49:47,817 --> 00:49:49,318
What?

740
00:49:49,418 --> 00:49:52,721
Nothing. It's just that I'm
under a lot of pressure.

741
00:49:52,822 --> 00:49:55,791
Claire, please... Please just...

742
00:49:55,891 --> 00:49:57,760
Give me two minutes.

743
00:49:59,728 --> 00:50:02,064
Tell me what happened Homecoming
night after the dance.

744
00:50:02,164 --> 00:50:04,133
What do you mean?

745
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:06,602
You know that's the night
Dina sent Mark the text.

746
00:50:06,702 --> 00:50:07,770
Yeah, of course.

747
00:50:07,870 --> 00:50:09,805
Well, there had to be a
reason for her to do it.

748
00:50:09,905 --> 00:50:11,273
What?

749
00:50:12,975 --> 00:50:15,478
Oh, Claire. This
is so important.

750
00:50:15,578 --> 00:50:18,514
Was Mark with Skylar at the
after party that night?

751
00:50:18,614 --> 00:50:20,816
I don't know.

752
00:50:20,916 --> 00:50:22,117
What do you mean with...

753
00:50:22,218 --> 00:50:24,253
Did they do anything?

754
00:50:24,353 --> 00:50:26,255
Did they hook up?

755
00:50:29,058 --> 00:50:30,759
♪ When she walked
into the room ♪

756
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,395
♪ I got addicted to
my point of view ♪

757
00:50:33,496 --> 00:50:35,064
- ♪ Now I can't stop - ♪ Hey!

758
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:36,532
- ♪ And I won't stop - ♪ Hey!

759
00:50:36,632 --> 00:50:40,236
♪ Come back and
show me some more ♪

760
00:50:46,275 --> 00:50:48,377
Claire.

761
00:50:48,477 --> 00:50:52,314
Did Skylar send you that text?

762
00:50:52,414 --> 00:50:55,684
Did she find it on Mark's phone?

763
00:50:58,954 --> 00:51:00,990
Mark, you've got to help me.

764
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,526
They listen to you,
they respect you.

765
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:06,195
Just, please tell
them this whole thing

766
00:51:06,295 --> 00:51:09,131
is between you and me.
And to just back off.

767
00:51:09,231 --> 00:51:11,200
It's not that simple, Dina.

768
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,535
Yes, it is.

769
00:51:12,635 --> 00:51:15,938
Stop! Come on!

770
00:51:16,038 --> 00:51:18,007
She's really got
you whipped, huh?

771
00:51:18,107 --> 00:51:21,343
Why is Skylar pushing
this so hard?

772
00:51:21,443 --> 00:51:24,013
You know I didn't send
that text, right?

773
00:51:24,113 --> 00:51:25,648
No, Mark. I don't.

774
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:28,083
I would really like
to believe you,

775
00:51:28,183 --> 00:51:31,987
but by the way that
you're acting,

776
00:51:32,087 --> 00:51:33,389
and hanging out with her,

777
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:35,424
bragging to your friends...

778
00:51:35,524 --> 00:51:38,694
Oh, if it isn't Dina Van Slut.

779
00:51:41,730 --> 00:51:44,800
You know this is going to
follow you forever, right?

780
00:51:47,202 --> 00:51:49,104
Uh. OK, what?

781
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:50,382
You know she totally
deserves it.

782
00:51:50,406 --> 00:51:51,707
No, she doesn't.

783
00:51:51,807 --> 00:51:54,176
She sent that picture to
me, not the whole school.

784
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:56,946
OK, but only one of us was willing
to show you the real thing.

785
00:51:57,046 --> 00:51:58,781
What'd you do? Steal my phone

786
00:51:58,881 --> 00:52:00,516
and send it to the
entire football team?

787
00:52:00,616 --> 00:52:03,218
Mm. Yeah, Mark. That
is exactly what I did.

788
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:04,863
No, of course not. You
know I wouldn't do that.

789
00:52:04,887 --> 00:52:06,622
Then why do you
hate her so much?

790
00:52:06,722 --> 00:52:10,993
Mark, I sent that
picture to one person.

791
00:52:11,093 --> 00:52:13,929
And so that makes
me the bad guy?

792
00:52:15,030 --> 00:52:17,333
I don't even know why
I'm talking to you.

793
00:52:21,537 --> 00:52:24,907
So, it was Skylar. OK.

794
00:52:25,007 --> 00:52:26,084
What difference does it make?

795
00:52:26,108 --> 00:52:29,011
Makes a lot of difference.

796
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:31,880
Thank you.

797
00:52:54,069 --> 00:52:57,573
- Hi.
- I need to talk to you.

798
00:52:58,674 --> 00:53:00,509
I need to talk to you too.

799
00:53:00,609 --> 00:53:04,713
I know it wasn't you.

800
00:53:13,322 --> 00:53:15,190
I understand why you
thought it was me.

801
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:18,794
I'm so sorry.

802
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:23,899
She had everything
going for her.

803
00:53:23,999 --> 00:53:25,801
Everything.

804
00:53:27,503 --> 00:53:30,673
But, I was just too
stupid to see it.

805
00:53:30,773 --> 00:53:33,842
If I hadn't been
such a jerk to her,

806
00:53:33,942 --> 00:53:36,845
she never would've
sent that picture.

807
00:53:36,945 --> 00:53:38,047
And I...

808
00:53:38,147 --> 00:53:41,684
I feel so guilty.

809
00:53:42,851 --> 00:53:45,888
It all just, spiraled
out of control, but...

810
00:53:48,957 --> 00:53:51,927
It started with me.

811
00:53:54,229 --> 00:53:56,999
You have no idea how
vicious it was.

812
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,301
How can kids...

813
00:53:59,401 --> 00:54:03,739
How can we be so
brutal to each other?

814
00:54:07,843 --> 00:54:11,480
I want you to know that I didn't
send that picture to anyone.

815
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,015
- I know.
- I didn't.

816
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:14,983
I know.

817
00:54:16,852 --> 00:54:19,722
But, I saw what it
was doing to her.

818
00:54:21,423 --> 00:54:23,358
And I didn't do a
thing to stop it.

819
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:25,294
It's OK.

820
00:54:25,394 --> 00:54:26,528
- It's OK.
- I'm sorry.

821
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:29,698
- I know.
- I'm sorry.

822
00:54:39,942 --> 00:54:42,711
It's still tough
seeing him, huh?

823
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:44,446
What?

824
00:54:44,546 --> 00:54:47,583
Oh, yeah...

825
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:51,086
I'm sorry.

826
00:54:53,455 --> 00:54:55,357
Well, I'll tell you this...

827
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:58,460
it's his loss, and I mean that.

828
00:54:59,762 --> 00:55:01,830
Hey.

829
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,700
You're on to bigger
and better things.

830
00:55:06,135 --> 00:55:07,936
Try and focus on that, OK?

831
00:55:08,036 --> 00:55:10,472
Sure.

832
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:15,144
I love you.

833
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,782
Love you, too.

834
00:55:21,817 --> 00:55:24,186
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, sweetie.

835
00:55:37,399 --> 00:55:40,669
Slut.

836
00:56:17,372 --> 00:56:19,608
She was cutting class.

837
00:56:19,708 --> 00:56:21,643
Her grades were slipping.

838
00:56:21,743 --> 00:56:23,879
She was even missing practice.

839
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:28,917
I couldn't believe she was
skipping field hockey practice.

840
00:56:29,017 --> 00:56:32,120
She loved that game
more than anything.

841
00:56:35,157 --> 00:56:38,126
- Where's Dina?
- Does it really matter?

842
00:56:38,227 --> 00:56:39,904
It's not like she's been
a real part of this team

843
00:56:39,928 --> 00:56:42,130
since she sent that whole
porno around the school.

844
00:56:42,231 --> 00:56:44,466
Don't you think you're being
a little hard on her?

845
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:46,768
It's been, like, three weeks.

846
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:49,671
Maybe we should just lay
off her for awhile.

847
00:56:49,771 --> 00:56:51,573
What? No!

848
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:53,041
She totally deserves it.

849
00:56:53,141 --> 00:56:55,544
She broke the first
rule of sexting.

850
00:56:55,644 --> 00:56:57,346
Don't show your face.

851
00:56:57,446 --> 00:57:03,051
It's always neck down, knees
up, no birth marks. Duh.

852
00:57:03,151 --> 00:57:04,419
I guess.

853
00:57:04,519 --> 00:57:08,390
I don't know, I just thought
maybe she's been through enough.

854
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:11,560
Yeah, but did you also know
that if we go to playoffs

855
00:57:11,660 --> 00:57:13,962
with Dina Van Cleve
on our roster,

856
00:57:14,062 --> 00:57:17,199
and that picture gets her
punted from the team

857
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:19,067
our whole season's at jeopardy.

858
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:21,770
They can disqualify us.

859
00:57:22,538 --> 00:57:23,839
They can do that?

860
00:57:23,939 --> 00:57:26,775
God, yes Claire.
They can do that.

861
00:57:26,875 --> 00:57:28,944
It's like she doesn't even care.

862
00:57:29,044 --> 00:57:33,148
So someone should
really tell Coach.

863
00:57:33,248 --> 00:57:35,851
I can't show her that picture.
I'll get in trouble.

864
00:57:35,951 --> 00:57:39,254
But, you still
have that picture?

865
00:57:39,354 --> 00:57:43,225
I mean, I figured some Freshman
boys had it to perv on,

866
00:57:43,325 --> 00:57:46,662
but really? I deleted
that like after a day.

867
00:57:46,762 --> 00:57:49,831
- Yeah, I deleted it too.
- Whatever.

868
00:57:49,932 --> 00:57:51,476
It's not like you even
have to show her.

869
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:54,870
Just tip her off. It's
not that hard to find.

870
00:57:54,970 --> 00:57:57,205
Well, why don't you do it?

871
00:57:57,306 --> 00:58:01,677
Because, Claire, Dina beat
me out for All Stars.

872
00:58:01,777 --> 00:58:04,947
If I did it, it'd look
like sour grapes.

873
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:08,784
But, if you did, it's
just civic duty.

874
00:58:10,285 --> 00:58:12,454
I don't know.

875
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:14,022
Life lesson, Claire:

876
00:58:14,122 --> 00:58:16,024
We are the company we keep.

877
00:58:16,124 --> 00:58:21,363
And if you want to walk this world
with the likes of Dina Van Cleve?

878
00:58:21,463 --> 00:58:22,831
That's fine.

879
00:58:22,931 --> 00:58:27,102
But remember, it'll be
your social suicide.

880
00:58:38,347 --> 00:58:41,283
I wish I could take everything
that happened back.

881
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:44,119
I never meant to hurt her.

882
00:58:45,754 --> 00:58:47,189
I want you to listen to me.

883
00:58:47,289 --> 00:58:53,261
You are not responsible for
what happened to Dina.

884
00:58:55,497 --> 00:58:58,600
And, I want to thank you,
from the bottom of my heart.

885
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:01,937
Being honest with me.

886
00:59:03,739 --> 00:59:05,907
You're the only
one who has been.

887
00:59:18,754 --> 00:59:22,090
Do you think I'm doing
the right thing?

888
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:25,360
What? In mourning the
death of your child?

889
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,830
Of course.

890
00:59:30,632 --> 00:59:32,334
No, I mean in a larger sense.

891
00:59:32,434 --> 00:59:34,269
Do you think I'm...

892
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:37,939
Do you think I'm
pushing too hard?

893
00:59:39,174 --> 00:59:42,544
Well... maybe.

894
00:59:42,644 --> 00:59:45,047
I don't know. I...

895
00:59:45,147 --> 00:59:49,484
You know, everybody has to deal
with these things in their own way.

896
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:54,356
Sometimes I really feel
like I'm going to be OK.

897
00:59:55,357 --> 00:59:57,492
And then...

898
00:59:57,592 --> 00:59:59,061
I will see something,

899
00:59:59,161 --> 01:00:03,732
and it will remind
me so much of her.

900
01:00:03,832 --> 01:00:06,368
That this...

901
01:00:06,468 --> 01:00:10,038
wave just comes over me.

902
01:00:10,138 --> 01:00:14,209
And... And I seize up.

903
01:00:17,712 --> 01:00:19,881
Oh, God sometimes I
feel like the only way

904
01:00:19,981 --> 01:00:23,985
that I can keep moving,
is if I, um...

905
01:00:24,086 --> 01:00:26,354
if I have a purpose.

906
01:00:27,823 --> 01:00:30,492
It's why I had to find
out who did this?

907
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,196
I'm going to make
us some more tea.

908
01:00:34,296 --> 01:00:35,964
Yeah?

909
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:40,969
I know it was Skylar.

910
01:00:42,637 --> 01:00:44,106
Excuse me?

911
01:00:44,206 --> 01:00:47,809
I know it was Skylar
who sent the text.

912
01:00:51,746 --> 01:00:53,815
That's ridiculous. Why
would Skylar do that?

913
01:00:53,915 --> 01:00:56,051
Because she was jealous of her.

914
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:58,920
Patty, she's been jealous of her
since the day she was born.

915
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:02,424
- No, she's not.
- Yes.

916
01:01:02,524 --> 01:01:04,893
She's not. Who told you this?

917
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:08,263
One of the kids told
me in confidence.

918
01:01:08,363 --> 01:01:11,433
- And you believed them?
- Yes, I believed them, Patty.

919
01:01:11,533 --> 01:01:13,568
They had no reason to lie to me.

920
01:01:13,668 --> 01:01:15,670
OK...

921
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:18,140
Skylar?

922
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:22,277
Honey, would you come
down here for a second?

923
01:01:24,713 --> 01:01:25,947
Yeah, Mom?

924
01:01:26,047 --> 01:01:29,084
Did you send that text
of Dina to anyone?

925
01:01:29,184 --> 01:01:32,187
No, of course not.

926
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,989
But, you did receive it?

927
01:01:34,089 --> 01:01:35,790
Well, yeah.

928
01:01:35,891 --> 01:01:39,361
But, everyone did eventually.

929
01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:40,896
Mrs. Van Cleve?

930
01:01:40,996 --> 01:01:45,233
I swear, I would've never
done that to Dina.

931
01:01:46,868 --> 01:01:48,503
Thank you, sweetie.

932
01:01:48,603 --> 01:01:50,539
Sure.

933
01:02:01,383 --> 01:02:03,351
I'd like to see her
phone, please.

934
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:05,153
Oh...

935
01:02:05,253 --> 01:02:07,489
Rachel, you're crossing
the line here.

936
01:02:07,589 --> 01:02:10,959
We have 17 years of friendship.

937
01:02:11,059 --> 01:02:14,029
I deserve your trust, I
think I've earned it.

938
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:16,865
I don't know who told
you that Skylar did it,

939
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:21,436
but I promise you,
they're mistaken.

940
01:02:21,536 --> 01:02:24,673
Oh, sweetie...

941
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:27,642
- I'm sorry.
- Oh...

942
01:02:27,742 --> 01:02:30,879
I just miss her so much.

943
01:02:30,979 --> 01:02:33,381
Oh, God.

944
01:02:33,481 --> 01:02:35,617
You need something much
stronger than tea.

945
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:37,953
OK?

946
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:39,454
Let me go get us something.

947
01:02:39,554 --> 01:02:42,424
- Yes, yes.
- OK.

948
01:02:42,524 --> 01:02:44,059
I'll be right back.

949
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:46,595
Oh, God. I'll have a double.

950
01:02:46,695 --> 01:02:49,231
I'm gonna...

951
01:02:49,331 --> 01:02:51,466
I'm gonna go use your bathroom.

952
01:02:51,566 --> 01:02:53,602
- OK.
- OK.

953
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,262
She thinks it was me.

954
01:03:54,362 --> 01:03:56,298
If Mark got arrested
then I'm gonna be next.

955
01:03:56,398 --> 01:03:59,200
Sweetheart, calm down. She
doesn't have anything,

956
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:01,336
it's just some baseless
finger pointing.

957
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:04,105
But, pointing leads to looking.

958
01:04:04,205 --> 01:04:05,974
Yeah, but what's she gonna find?

959
01:04:06,074 --> 01:04:09,144
You didn't send that
text out to anyone.

960
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:10,745
No.

961
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:12,147
Except for one person. I...

962
01:04:12,247 --> 01:04:14,282
- Sky!
- It's just Claire!

963
01:04:14,382 --> 01:04:18,887
I... I just didn't want her thinking Dina
was the saint everyone thought she was.

964
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:22,190
Does that mean I'm
gonna get in trouble?

965
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:25,360
It breaks our heart,
what happened to Dina.

966
01:04:25,460 --> 01:04:28,830
But, you didn't put that scarf
around her neck. Did you?

967
01:04:28,930 --> 01:04:31,399
Mom... Of course not.

968
01:04:31,499 --> 01:04:35,503
Of course not. Of course not.

969
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:40,075
Then there's nothing
to worry about. OK?

970
01:04:40,175 --> 01:04:42,377
Go grab those cookies.
Meet me in the kitchen.

971
01:04:42,477 --> 01:04:44,145
Come on.

972
01:04:49,784 --> 01:04:52,921
I'd like to drop the charges
against Mark Carey.

973
01:04:53,021 --> 01:04:54,656
I think that's a wise decision.

974
01:04:54,756 --> 01:04:57,559
After all, he's a bright young man
with a very promising future.

975
01:04:57,659 --> 01:05:00,995
Because, I now firmly believe it was
Skylar Reid who instigated the bullying.

976
01:05:01,096 --> 01:05:04,566
Rachel, why can't
you let this go?

977
01:05:04,666 --> 01:05:06,644
I found a stack of magazines
in the Reid's bathroom

978
01:05:06,668 --> 01:05:08,646
with cut out letters that
look exactly like the ones

979
01:05:08,670 --> 01:05:10,839
- on the threats I received.
- That's hardly proof.

980
01:05:10,939 --> 01:05:13,017
Well, maybe not. But once we
get the cell phone records,

981
01:05:13,041 --> 01:05:15,319
I guarantee we're going to see it's
Skylar who sent around that text.

982
01:05:15,343 --> 01:05:17,946
Rachel, we did. She only
sent it to one person.

983
01:05:18,046 --> 01:05:22,117
- Who?
- Claire Stevens.

984
01:05:22,217 --> 01:05:24,919
And then on Sunday afternoon

985
01:05:25,019 --> 01:05:29,057
Claire broadcast the text to
about 40 different numbers.

986
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:30,835
We don't know who all the
recipients were yet,

987
01:05:30,859 --> 01:05:35,730
but we do know it was Claire
who made the sext go viral.

988
01:05:54,215 --> 01:05:56,518
I've heard people say that...

989
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:58,720
when you hit rock bottom

990
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,823
there's no where
else to go but up.

991
01:06:10,265 --> 01:06:13,902
I've heard people say that...

992
01:06:14,002 --> 01:06:15,813
- when you hit rock bottom...
- How could you do it?

993
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:18,072
There's no where
else to go but up.

994
01:06:18,173 --> 01:06:21,743
I should call the
police right now.

995
01:06:21,843 --> 01:06:27,248
And like everyday, I
wake up and I just...

996
01:06:27,348 --> 01:06:30,718
sink lower

997
01:06:30,819 --> 01:06:33,221
and lower then I ever

998
01:06:33,321 --> 01:06:36,324
thought possible.

999
01:06:37,759 --> 01:06:40,028
Jesus...

1000
01:06:40,128 --> 01:06:41,763
Today...

1001
01:06:41,863 --> 01:06:45,567
I don't really know
what to say...

1002
01:06:47,268 --> 01:06:53,608
Today, I got kicked off
the field hockey team.

1003
01:06:54,843 --> 01:06:59,214
And my scholarship offer
to Price is gone.

1004
01:07:05,987 --> 01:07:07,422
- Dina?
- Yeah?

1005
01:07:07,522 --> 01:07:09,724
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

1006
01:07:11,125 --> 01:07:14,028
I saw the picture.

1007
01:07:14,128 --> 01:07:17,732
And I have no choice but to
ask you to leave the team.

1008
01:07:17,832 --> 01:07:22,403
And it breaks my heart because
I am required by NCAA rules,

1009
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:24,806
to report this to Price as well.

1010
01:07:24,906 --> 01:07:27,408
I'm so sorry.

1011
01:07:27,509 --> 01:07:30,044
I know this was just some
harmless little thing

1012
01:07:30,144 --> 01:07:32,046
between you and your boyfriend.

1013
01:07:32,146 --> 01:07:36,251
But, unfortunately it has
enormous consequences.

1014
01:07:36,351 --> 01:07:39,454
I'm so sorry.

1015
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:41,523
If you want to talk about it,

1016
01:07:41,623 --> 01:07:44,292
my door is always open, Dina.

1017
01:07:59,607 --> 01:08:01,976
I didn't know you still
went to this school.

1018
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:06,948
Oh, um... Dina, I
forgot to ask you,

1019
01:08:07,048 --> 01:08:10,018
how was All Star camp? You
know, my friend Sarah said

1020
01:08:10,118 --> 01:08:12,220
that you made quite
the impression.

1021
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:15,623
What a waste, right?

1022
01:08:15,723 --> 01:08:18,426
Man, those scouts must've
been really impressed.

1023
01:08:18,526 --> 01:08:21,129
You know, with your tits.

1024
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:24,465
You are such a bitch.

1025
01:08:26,067 --> 01:08:28,836
Yeah, it's better then a slut.

1026
01:08:28,937 --> 01:08:30,772
Oh, my God!

1027
01:08:36,911 --> 01:08:39,714
- Dina!
- What? If you hated me that much,

1028
01:08:39,814 --> 01:08:42,884
I'm surprised it took you
that long to run to Coach.

1029
01:08:42,984 --> 01:08:44,485
What are you talking about?

1030
01:08:44,586 --> 01:08:46,955
I'm off the team.

1031
01:08:47,055 --> 01:08:48,323
Don't pretend you didn't know.

1032
01:08:48,423 --> 01:08:49,757
I didn't know, OK?

1033
01:08:49,857 --> 01:08:52,060
I also didn't know she
had it in her, wow.

1034
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:53,328
What?

1035
01:08:53,428 --> 01:08:56,497
I didn't narc you out.
Claire did.

1036
01:08:56,598 --> 01:08:59,267
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1037
01:08:59,367 --> 01:09:01,970
Because you guys are so close.

1038
01:09:03,004 --> 01:09:06,641
- What's going on?
- Is it true?

1039
01:09:07,709 --> 01:09:09,344
What?

1040
01:09:11,446 --> 01:09:13,948
How could you do that to me?

1041
01:09:14,048 --> 01:09:15,583
What are you talking about?

1042
01:09:15,683 --> 01:09:18,953
You know what I'm talking about!
You stabbed me in the back!

1043
01:09:19,053 --> 01:09:20,588
For what, huh?

1044
01:09:20,688 --> 01:09:25,526
In some sad, misguided hope
that people would talk to you,

1045
01:09:25,627 --> 01:09:27,362
and not about you?

1046
01:09:28,296 --> 01:09:29,664
That they would like you?

1047
01:09:29,764 --> 01:09:32,367
When, newsflash. They won't.

1048
01:09:33,468 --> 01:09:36,804
You are so spineless.

1049
01:09:36,904 --> 01:09:41,242
She ratted you out, so
she's not so spineless.

1050
01:09:41,342 --> 01:09:45,079
Yeah, I'm not so spineless.

1051
01:09:48,883 --> 01:09:54,589
And I just feel like,
everything that I loved and...

1052
01:09:54,689 --> 01:09:58,426
And my escape and my
future is just gone.

1053
01:09:58,526 --> 01:10:02,697
And for what? You know?

1054
01:10:02,797 --> 01:10:08,302
Because I, I sent some stupid
picture to my boyfriend?

1055
01:10:08,403 --> 01:10:11,706
No, it's not... It's
because my best friend

1056
01:10:11,806 --> 01:10:14,509
decided to throw
me under the bus.

1057
01:10:14,609 --> 01:10:18,279
Claire,

1058
01:10:18,379 --> 01:10:21,449
I wish I could see your face

1059
01:10:21,549 --> 01:10:25,019
when you flip to the
end of this story.

1060
01:10:28,523 --> 01:10:30,591
I'm done.

1061
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:36,597
Just... so done.

1062
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:47,041
I hate myself for what I did.

1063
01:10:47,141 --> 01:10:51,279
I just, I wanted
Skylar to like me.

1064
01:10:51,379 --> 01:10:54,382
I didn't want the team
to be disqualified.

1065
01:10:54,482 --> 01:10:57,518
I never got to apologize.

1066
01:10:57,618 --> 01:11:01,089
I can't believe I didn't
help her, I just...

1067
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:03,858
I was so scared.

1068
01:11:04,992 --> 01:11:07,662
The last time I saw her,

1069
01:11:07,762 --> 01:11:10,364
the way I treated her,

1070
01:11:10,465 --> 01:11:15,103
God, I really am spineless.

1071
01:11:17,505 --> 01:11:20,174
I am so sorry.

1072
01:11:20,274 --> 01:11:24,545
I'm so sorry that you lost
your daughter because I...

1073
01:11:24,645 --> 01:11:28,049
don't know how to
stand up to people.

1074
01:11:33,087 --> 01:11:37,925
How could you send that
to so many people?

1075
01:11:39,794 --> 01:11:42,864
I didn't Mrs. V, I
wouldn't do that.

1076
01:11:42,964 --> 01:11:45,700
After the dance, I forgot
my phone in the limo

1077
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,703
and then the company dropped
it off at Skylar's house

1078
01:11:48,803 --> 01:11:50,605
and I went to pick
it up the next day.

1079
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:53,708
That's why I thought that
it was Skylar all along.

1080
01:11:53,808 --> 01:11:56,911
You went to the Reid's house?

1081
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:01,349
- Mrs. Reid?
- Yeah?

1082
01:12:01,449 --> 01:12:02,860
I found this phone in
the back of my limo

1083
01:12:02,884 --> 01:12:04,385
when I was cleaning
up this morning.

1084
01:12:04,485 --> 01:12:06,354
It was wedged between
one of the seats.

1085
01:12:06,454 --> 01:12:07,922
Those kids left quite a mess.

1086
01:12:08,022 --> 01:12:09,824
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.
- No problem.

1087
01:12:09,924 --> 01:12:11,526
- I'm used to it.
- OK.

1088
01:12:11,626 --> 01:12:13,261
- Have a nice day.
- Thanks.

1089
01:12:13,361 --> 01:12:14,962
Bye.

1090
01:12:17,532 --> 01:12:20,401
Patricia...

1091
01:12:20,501 --> 01:12:23,538
Oh, God...

1092
01:12:31,245 --> 01:12:32,613
Is that you, honey?

1093
01:12:32,713 --> 01:12:35,049
Hurry up, we gotta go
meet your dad for dinner.

1094
01:12:35,149 --> 01:12:38,786
Tonight? Ugh... I'm
so not up for that.

1095
01:12:38,886 --> 01:12:41,589
I know, but at least he's
not bringing the wife.

1096
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,125
So, come on. Put
on something nice.

1097
01:12:45,693 --> 01:12:47,695
Mom? Your phone's ringing.

1098
01:12:47,795 --> 01:12:50,898
Must be Dad, saying
he's late as usual.

1099
01:12:50,998 --> 01:12:53,234
Just let it go to voice mail.

1100
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:55,002
I'll call him back.

1101
01:12:55,102 --> 01:12:57,205
I'll just text him.

1102
01:12:59,841 --> 01:13:01,642
Claire?

1103
01:13:10,551 --> 01:13:12,520
I saw it.

1104
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:15,556
I saw Dina's picture
on your phone.

1105
01:13:15,656 --> 01:13:18,759
Oh, my God, what did you do?

1106
01:13:19,894 --> 01:13:21,796
What are you talking about?

1107
01:13:21,896 --> 01:13:25,032
- You sent it out?
- No.

1108
01:13:25,132 --> 01:13:29,470
Claire sent it out. They
have the phone records.

1109
01:13:29,570 --> 01:13:31,806
But, you had Claire's phone.

1110
01:13:31,906 --> 01:13:35,610
So, what did you do? Send
yourself one for a souvenir?

1111
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:39,714
I did it for you.

1112
01:13:39,814 --> 01:13:42,383
- No...
- Dina made you so unhappy.

1113
01:13:42,483 --> 01:13:46,387
And she took so much from you.

1114
01:13:46,487 --> 01:13:49,390
You wouldn't have gotten
that scholarship otherwise.

1115
01:13:49,490 --> 01:13:52,326
Mom! That was her scholarship.

1116
01:13:52,426 --> 01:13:55,363
She was the great athlete,
she was the honor student.

1117
01:13:55,463 --> 01:13:57,698
She deserved it.

1118
01:14:00,268 --> 01:14:03,437
You trashed her grave.

1119
01:14:03,538 --> 01:14:05,840
And the brick? It was all you!

1120
01:14:05,940 --> 01:14:10,478
You'll understand when you
have children of your own.

1121
01:14:10,578 --> 01:14:14,682
Skylar... I love you so much,

1122
01:14:14,782 --> 01:14:17,585
I would do anything for you.

1123
01:14:17,685 --> 01:14:19,553
Anything.

1124
01:14:19,654 --> 01:14:21,956
I may have teased her,
but I would've never

1125
01:14:22,056 --> 01:14:23,691
wanted her to kill herself.

1126
01:14:23,791 --> 01:14:26,360
OK. Listen to me.

1127
01:14:26,460 --> 01:14:29,797
It was just a harmless prank.

1128
01:14:29,897 --> 01:14:32,333
I had no idea Dina
was that unhinged.

1129
01:14:32,433 --> 01:14:37,505
But, but she killed herself. Not us.
Our hands are clean.

1130
01:14:37,605 --> 01:14:40,308
Mom, no they're not. And
they never will be.

1131
01:14:40,408 --> 01:14:42,476
Skylar! Honey, Skylar?

1132
01:14:42,576 --> 01:14:45,479
- Where are you going?
- Away from you!

1133
01:14:45,579 --> 01:14:48,382
Sky... Skylar!

1134
01:14:51,218 --> 01:14:52,887
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1135
01:14:58,059 --> 01:14:59,360
Delete.

1136
01:15:19,180 --> 01:15:20,614
Patricia Reid?

1137
01:15:20,715 --> 01:15:23,584
Officer, my daughter just took off
in my car. And she's very upset.

1138
01:15:23,684 --> 01:15:27,355
You are under arrest for the suspected
dissemination of child pornography.

1139
01:15:27,455 --> 01:15:30,324
I need you to come with
me down to the station.

1140
01:16:44,165 --> 01:16:47,068
Is she going to be all right?

1141
01:16:50,871 --> 01:16:53,941
Did you come here to gloat?

1142
01:16:56,710 --> 01:16:58,312
No.

1143
01:17:00,114 --> 01:17:03,017
I came to say that I'm sorry.

1144
01:17:05,386 --> 01:17:08,622
I'm so sorry that you're
now going through the pain

1145
01:17:08,723 --> 01:17:11,058
that I'm going through.

1146
01:17:12,526 --> 01:17:15,296
If anybody on the earth
knows what it feels like,

1147
01:17:15,396 --> 01:17:17,832
it's me.

1148
01:17:17,932 --> 01:17:21,502
And I wouldn't wish that kind
of pain on my worst enemy.

1149
01:17:23,904 --> 01:17:27,508
And, I wanted to say that...

1150
01:17:30,277 --> 01:17:32,947
I'm sorry...

1151
01:17:35,983 --> 01:17:41,021
that you found my
daughter so threatening.

1152
01:17:43,324 --> 01:17:45,025
I don't know what
it could've been

1153
01:17:45,126 --> 01:17:48,529
about my sweet Dina that
threatened you so much.

1154
01:17:50,164 --> 01:17:52,833
But, I'm so sorry that
you felt that way.

1155
01:17:56,070 --> 01:17:59,006
And, lastly...

1156
01:17:59,106 --> 01:18:03,010
I'm sorry that our
friendship wasn't real.

1157
01:18:09,617 --> 01:18:13,187
I hope that Skylar's OK, Patty.

1158
01:18:13,287 --> 01:18:16,157
And I'll pray for that
sweet girl every night.

1159
01:18:19,994 --> 01:18:22,429
But, I will see you in court.

1160
01:18:44,785 --> 01:18:47,521
Someone once told me
that common sufferings

1161
01:18:47,621 --> 01:18:50,424
are far stronger bond
than common joys.

1162
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,893
If that's the case then

1163
01:18:52,993 --> 01:18:56,664
Patricia and I are
closer than ever.

1164
01:18:56,764 --> 01:18:58,232
Dina's still gone.

1165
01:18:58,332 --> 01:19:03,637
And Skylar may never walk again.

1166
01:19:03,737 --> 01:19:09,376
I guess, ultimately, I thought I
might find some peace in all this.

1167
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:14,882
Or, at least, I hoped I would.

1168
01:19:16,283 --> 01:19:18,361
I just wanted to understand
what my daughter went through.

1169
01:19:18,385 --> 01:19:23,557
And I wanted other people
to understand it, too.

1170
01:19:23,657 --> 01:19:26,093
But, now that it's over...

1171
01:19:26,193 --> 01:19:30,197
honestly, I just wish I knew I
made any difference at all.

1172
01:19:35,636 --> 01:19:38,405
- Mrs. V?
- Hey, come in.

1173
01:19:38,505 --> 01:19:39,740
Hi.

1174
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,508
How are you?

1175
01:19:42,843 --> 01:19:44,311
I'm OK.

1176
01:19:44,411 --> 01:19:48,015
- How are you?
- I'm OK, too.

1177
01:19:48,115 --> 01:19:52,987
Um... I actually kind of
have a surprise for you.

1178
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:55,890
Would you come with me?
To the school?

1179
01:19:55,990 --> 01:19:58,993
Do you need me to
go to the school?

1180
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:02,429
Can you just trust me on this?

1181
01:20:04,064 --> 01:20:06,166
I trust you.

1182
01:20:22,816 --> 01:20:25,753
What is this?

1183
01:20:25,853 --> 01:20:27,988
You'll see.

1184
01:20:51,845 --> 01:20:53,447
Please have a seat.

1185
01:21:00,421 --> 01:21:03,090
I'm really glad you came.

1186
01:21:12,766 --> 01:21:15,602
Thank you all for
being here today.

1187
01:21:17,204 --> 01:21:19,973
As we all know, this
has been a fall

1188
01:21:20,074 --> 01:21:23,877
full of tragedy
here at Westfield.

1189
01:21:23,978 --> 01:21:27,214
We have lost a...

1190
01:21:27,314 --> 01:21:30,351
We have lost a member
of our Senior class.

1191
01:21:32,586 --> 01:21:37,324
It's easy to say that Dina was
responsible for her own death.

1192
01:21:37,424 --> 01:21:41,128
But, I think we all
know the truth.

1193
01:21:41,228 --> 01:21:44,398
Bullying is poisonous.

1194
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:50,371
It pervades our schools and our
society in horrifying ways.

1195
01:21:50,471 --> 01:21:55,142
And today, with the anonymous
communication we have via technology,

1196
01:21:55,242 --> 01:21:58,379
it makes bullying
that much easier.

1197
01:21:58,479 --> 01:22:00,180
I'm going to say it right now,

1198
01:22:00,280 --> 01:22:02,683
and no one in this
room can deny it.

1199
01:22:02,783 --> 01:22:06,253
Dina Van Cleve was
bullied to death.

1200
01:22:06,353 --> 01:22:08,989
She was not responsible.

1201
01:22:09,089 --> 01:22:11,658
Everyone in this
room is responsible.

1202
01:22:11,759 --> 01:22:15,696
Everyone who saw the
text and passed it on.

1203
01:22:15,796 --> 01:22:17,364
Everyone who called her names,

1204
01:22:17,464 --> 01:22:23,670
everyone who giggled when
she passed in the halls.

1205
01:22:23,771 --> 01:22:27,608
Everyone who didn't do
everything in their power

1206
01:22:27,708 --> 01:22:31,979
to stop the cruelty that
Dina had to endure.

1207
01:22:32,079 --> 01:22:34,681
And I'm as guilty
as the rest of you.

1208
01:22:34,782 --> 01:22:40,487
Maybe even more so, because
I was Dina's best friend.

1209
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:49,396
What I am proposing here
today maybe a small gesture,

1210
01:22:49,496 --> 01:22:53,200
but I think the statement
it makes will be huge.

1211
01:22:53,300 --> 01:22:56,136
I want each and every one of us

1212
01:22:56,236 --> 01:22:58,972
to take responsibility
for this tragedy.

1213
01:22:59,072 --> 01:23:00,808
And pledge to give
up our cell phones

1214
01:23:00,908 --> 01:23:03,177
for the rest of the semester.

1215
01:23:23,430 --> 01:23:25,499
Thank you.

1216
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,656
All right, so this
is my response

1217
01:24:55,756 --> 01:24:57,791
to the "what is happiness" tag.

1218
01:24:57,891 --> 01:25:00,703
I know I should take more time to think
about the good things in my life.

1219
01:25:00,727 --> 01:25:03,697
So, this seemed like
the perfect excuse.

1220
01:25:03,797 --> 01:25:05,165
All right.

1221
01:25:05,265 --> 01:25:07,701
So, things that make me happy...

1222
01:25:07,801 --> 01:25:13,874
- Uh... Christmas movies in August.
- Yes!

1223
01:25:13,974 --> 01:25:15,375
Ahh, Gerbera Daisies.

1224
01:25:15,475 --> 01:25:17,211
