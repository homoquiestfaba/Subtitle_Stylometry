1
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,480
Hey, sexy, let's go.

2
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,080
Yo, Chu Chu...

3
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,159
No, I'm out, man. He's coming.

4
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,319
It's a rap. He's coming!

5
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,319
No, he's coming.

6
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,680
Tell Smoke his punk-ass

7
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:29,000
was supposed to be here
30 minutes ago.

8
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,400
Instead he out there hiding.

9
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,360
Instead of coming
and facing me like a man.

10
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Listen, Chu Chu,
he'll be here.

11
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:36,479
No, that's bullshit.
I'm out.

12
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,599
He'll be here.

13
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:38,639
I want my money.

14
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,120
Listen, if you ask me,

15
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,520
he's just waiting
to make an entrance.

16
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,759
Look out,
little girl.

17
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,120
All right, I'll give him
five minutes.

18
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,280
No, make it one.

19
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,400
Black Knights!

20
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,280
Hear ye! Hear ye!
Gather 'round!

21
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,599
Black Knights in town.

22
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:09,439
And all you mere mortals
need to bow that ass down!

23
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:12,360
If you have never seen Smoke
do his thing on a motorcycle

24
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,960
then you have never seen

25
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,480
a brother on a motorcycle
do his thing.

26
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,680
Oh, glory be to God,

27
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,879
y'all, 'cause you know
He had a vision.

28
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,519
He put Arthur Ashe on the clay,

29
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,720
Jackie Robinson on the diamond,

30
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,199
Muhammad Ali in the ring
and my man, Smoke,

31
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,199
on the two wheels!

32
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,199
So don't be s-s-stuttering
and standing your ass around.

33
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Get down on your knees
and bow that ass down.

34
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,279
Word!

35
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,680
He's still gonna lose.

36
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,680
Slick Will.

37
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,120
Right on, brother.

38
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,519
What up, Kid?

39
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,519
Hey.

40
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,399
<i>Long as I can remember,</i>

41
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,959
<i>my dad and Smoke</i>
<i>were best friends.</i>

42
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
<i>As long as anyone can remember,</i>
<i>Smoke was known</i>

43
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,040
<i>as "The King of Cali."</i>

44
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:13,480
<i>But if anyone outraced him,</i>
<i>they could win his crown.</i>

45
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:16,000
203 races.

46
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,240
I ain't found nobody with enough
ride to take this from me.

47
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,959
Let's make it a lot better.
Two grand.

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,439
Sound like money
in the bank to me.

49
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,879
Cha-ching.

50
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,120
<i>The deal was,</i>
<i>a lot of people had dreams</i>

51
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,439
<i>of one day winning that crown.</i>

52
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,480
You all right?

53
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:43,199
Yeah, I just needed
more acceleration.

54
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:45,240
Yeah, and you would've
fallen on your behind

55
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,240
a lot faster.

56
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,240
Come on, let's get this.

57
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,160
All right, Dad.

58
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:50,759
Here we go.
One, two, three.

59
00:05:52,839 --> 00:05:55,800
Go help get Smoke's ride
off the truck, all right?

60
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,720
Damn!

61
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:09,160
Damn!

62
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,360
Damn.

63
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,959
Excuse me.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,360
Excuse me.

65
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,839
You're sort of in my path.

66
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,639
I like the way you put that.

67
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,639
Put what?

68
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,079
You could've said
I was in your way.

69
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,319
But you said I
was in your path.

70
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,839
You know, it's like
me and your paths

71
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:39,839
are meant to cross.

72
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:41,920
Feel what I'm saying?

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
No.

74
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,199
Anyway, my name is Kid.

75
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,879
You want a medal
for that or something?

76
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,399
I just want some
conversation, that's all.

77
00:06:48,439 --> 00:06:51,000
Just a little conversation.

78
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,240
Hmm.

79
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,879
Well, there's
only one problem, Kid.

80
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,079
What's that, beautiful?

81
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,680
I don't converse
with prospects.

82
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,160
Excuse me.

83
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,120
<i>A prospect.</i>

84
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,079
<i>I was at the bottom.</i>

85
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,600
<i>I wanted to be recognized</i>
<i>as a true rider.</i>

86
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,079
<i>Especially from my dad.</i>

87
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,160
Dad. Dad!

88
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,160
What?

89
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,160
When do I get my colors?

90
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,199
What?

91
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,399
I'm saying,
this prospect thing...

92
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,560
I can't roll
like this no more.

93
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,560
That's Smoke's call, boy.

94
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Good, man. Good.

95
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:30,800
Damn, Will,
she is tight.

96
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,959
<i>The way I saw it,</i>
<i>my concerns were not his.</i>

97
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,360
<i>Being Smoke's mechanic,</i>
<i>there was only one rider</i>

98
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,839
<i>my dad seemed to care about.</i>

99
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,360
Nice work, Will.

100
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,759
Hey, thanks, baby.

101
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,879
You, too, Kid.

102
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,680
Hey, Smoke, listen, man.

103
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,399
Burn rubber,
not your soul, baby.

104
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,720
Burn rubber, not your soul.

105
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:58,240
I don't see why we stay up
all night fixing his bike

106
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,959
while he takin'
all the bows.

107
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,240
First of all, "we" didn't
stay up all night, I did.

108
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,680
You fell asleep, remember?

109
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,519
Second of all, you know,
Smoke always tells me

110
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,199
that when he lines
his bike up for a race,

111
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,160
he doesn't see anything,
he doesn't hear anything.

112
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,920
Just a finish line.

113
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:17,360
A cat like that gets in the
zone... that's a gift from God.

114
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,399
Sound like bullshit to me.

115
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,319
Well, you should wish
you could be half as good.

116
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,480
<i>My dad once said the difference</i>
<i>between men and boys</i>

117
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,000
<i>is the lessons they learn.</i>

118
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,240
<i>Well, my father</i>
<i>taught me plenty.</i>

119
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,240
Is that nitrous I smell

120
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,080
up underneath that
bike, Chu Chu?

121
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,759
What you smell is your ass,
which I'm about to take.

122
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,679
No, what I'm smellin'
is victory, brother,

123
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,360
'cause, by the time you get
to second gear to kick it in,

124
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,360
I'll be across the finish line

125
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,080
and all you gonna smell
is my smoke.

126
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,240
And that's when you gonna
wake up and realize

127
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,000
the only reason you smoked
so much ass up in Fresno

128
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,679
is because I wasn't in it.

129
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,200
I bet a G on Smoke.

130
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,639
You take Chu Chu.

131
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,799
Chu Chu? Aw, hell, no.
Not Chu Chu, man.

132
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,080
See, Slick Will is almost
as good a mechanic as me.

133
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,639
Almost.

134
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,080
You gon' have
to take Chu Chu.

135
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,440
You must be crazy.

136
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:51,320
Brothers,
when the green light turns red.

137
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,840
Smoke, Chu Chu.

138
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,519
All right.

139
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,000
Let me tell you something.

140
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,080
Bottom line: I don't want
to hear all of this.

141
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,360
Somebody ain't got my money.

142
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,600
Why it got to be like that?

143
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:45,799
Let's go, baby!
Come on!

144
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,039
Go! Go!

145
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,120
Yes!

146
00:11:28,279 --> 00:11:29,240
Yeah!

147
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,559
Oh!

148
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,759
Will!

149
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:16,919
Come on, hurry up, man!

150
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,039
Will! Will!

151
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:35,159
Hey, get an ambulance!

152
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,639
My God!

153
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,639
Breathe!
Now, breathe!

154
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:48,960
Don't touch him!
Don't touch him!

155
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Don't nobody touch him.

156
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,000
...thank you for the life
of William Alex Crooms.

157
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,559
If it's all
right with you,

158
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:45,480
we'd like this
buried with him.

159
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:52,279
Everybody has signed it.

160
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,919
He'd be proud to have this.

161
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:00,919
Look, Nita, if you need
anything, money, anything,

162
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,559
come to me first,
I got you.

163
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,919
You all right?

164
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
Just got to get
out of here, man.

165
00:15:51,159 --> 00:15:53,799
Jalil, you know I don't want him
playing those violent games.

166
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,519
It's not that violent,
is it, Willie?

167
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:58,279
Nope, it ain't
that violent.

168
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,639
Okay, that's it.

169
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,679
You go to bed

170
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,639
brush your teeth

171
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,440
and take them little
cruddy shoes with you.

172
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,440
Hey, hey.

173
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,879
Five more minutes

174
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,600
on that phone,
then I want you off.

175
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,159
We're going over homework.

176
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,080
Oh, I was not born
yesterday, Miss Thing.

177
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
Five minutes.

178
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,440
All right, scrub,
move on over.

179
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,960
Oh, yeah, let Mama
give that baby

180
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,200
a little spanking,
come on.

181
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,200
Okay.

182
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,440
Let's see what
you're working with.

183
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
You're the scrub.

184
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,240
Honey, your mama
got skills.

185
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,360
Ooh.
That must've hurt.

186
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,720
Boy, you still alive?

187
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,879
Go on, lay down and die.

188
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:36,879
You're injured?

189
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,679
Let me just finish
you off... here you go.

190
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,679
Ooh!

191
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,679
Hey!

192
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Man!

193
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:42,759
That's all right, baby.

194
00:16:42,799 --> 00:16:43,960
I'll give you a rematch.

195
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,960
It is all right.

196
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,960
Yeah, I know it's okay.

197
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,360
I'm gonna go get me
something to eat.

198
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,080
Boy, you just ate dinner
an hour ago.

199
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,399
Stop tripping.

200
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,920
Jalil...

201
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
you be careful.

202
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,160
Don't worry about me.

203
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:10,400
I usually only get
gunned down once a night.

204
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,079
Cee Cee! Cee Cee!

205
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,400
Off the phone now!

206
00:18:08,319 --> 00:18:10,079
Donny!

207
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:11,920
Yo, Donny, come on,
I'm calling you out!

208
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,240
Donny!

209
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:15,559
Go on. Ten dollars.
Have your cash ready.

210
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,319
Donny, come on out!

211
00:18:20,359 --> 00:18:22,480
Yo, what's up, Jerome?

212
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:25,640
Kid? Oh, shit, Kid!

213
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:28,440
Yo, dawg!
Put me down, man!

214
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,079
Hey, where the hell
you been, brother?!

215
00:18:30,119 --> 00:18:31,839
Man, ain't nobody
seen you since...

216
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,039
Any-anyway, man, it's good
to see you again, dawg!

217
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,759
Yeah.

218
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:39,319
I have $500 that says
I'm gonna take your helmet.

219
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,880
That's a funny dude.

220
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,759
I'm gonna go bust
his fool ass.

221
00:18:45,799 --> 00:18:47,440
Now, hold on.
Is Donny here yet?

222
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,480
Yeah, he's here.

223
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:51,519
I mean, if you want me to,
I'll tell Donny what's up.

224
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:53,559
Have Donny bust that fool,
feel me?

225
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,720
Donny.

226
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:55,799
Yeah.

227
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,799
Yo, Kid, don't be such a
stranger, man, come on.

228
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,960
Whoo! Looks good.

229
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,440
Yeah, you hooked
this one up.

230
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,440
It looks real good.

231
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,039
You're gonna have
to keep this on here

232
00:19:35,079 --> 00:19:36,440
for another day
at least, though.

233
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,079
Mm-hmm.

234
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,880
Yo, I need you
to hook me up.

235
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:43,200
I got this new girl
who want to get a tattoo, right?

236
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,440
Uh-huh.

237
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,599
She want to put my name
on her cheek.

238
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
I take it you don't
mean on her face.

239
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,920
Mm-mm. 

240
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,079
Uh-uh.

241
00:19:51,119 --> 00:19:52,680
You know how I do...
I got to brand my women.

242
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,799
- Uh-uh.
- Right on their ass.

243
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,279
Yo, what's up, Donny?

244
00:20:05,319 --> 00:20:06,880
Who the hell are you?

245
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,920
Yo, yo, yo

246
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,039
that's Slick
Will's son.

247
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,359
Okay. Wassup?

248
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,839
You too big to
pay respects, Kid?

249
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,000
How you doing,
Queenie?

250
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,160
I'm a'ight.

251
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,200
How you doing?

252
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,400
Guess I'm all right.

253
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,079
Yo, I thought
you might

254
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,359
want to know... some drunk fool

255
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,079
calling you out.

256
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,000
That fool?

257
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,279
I beat him last week
for 200 bucks.

258
00:20:29,319 --> 00:20:32,960
Oh, you know, man,
he talking about 500

259
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,240
and your lid.

260
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:35,960
What?!

261
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,519
You set that up, for real.

262
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,240
</i>

263
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,079
So what the hell
you doing?

264
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,160
Getting ready to race you.

265
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,359
Without a lid?

266
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,720
You're not just drunk,
you crazy.

267
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:29,559
Just consider it a reminder
in case you glance at me.

268
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:30,880
Reminder of what?

269
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,880
That your lid's
about to become mine.

270
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Yeah, right!

271
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,279
What's happening?
Girl, what's happening now?

272
00:21:37,359 --> 00:21:39,079
Whoa, lookit,
the queen has came out.

273
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:40,119
Hey, Queenie,
you up next?

274
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Donny!

275
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,160
What's happening, T.J.?

276
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,160
Got us
a race here, huh?

277
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,599
Oh, yeah.
We about to get

278
00:21:45,599 --> 00:21:47,279
into this boy ass
right here.

279
00:21:47,319 --> 00:21:48,319
Whoa.

280
00:21:48,359 --> 00:21:50,440
Where'd you get your bike, boy?
Off eBay?

281
00:21:52,319 --> 00:21:55,359
Good luck to you.

282
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,519
Hey, how you doing?

283
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,599
- Yeah!

284
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,839
Kick some ass.

285
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,440
Keep the wheels down, boys.

286
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
Hey, doll, wassup?
Wassup, wassup?

287
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:41,960
Kid!

288
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,880
I don't know
what the hell

289
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,279
your fool ass
was trying to prove...

290
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:01,160
but whatever it was,
you proved it.

291
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:08,000
I-I think I just won.

292
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:10,039
Yeah, you did.

293
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,440
Fill it up.

294
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,000
You get any
of my messages?

295
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,680
I've been kind of busy.

296
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,079
Talk to you
for a second?

297
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,400
I see you got your bike
running kind of right.

298
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,559
Oh, you think?

299
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,240
Oh, yeah, yeah.

300
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,799
Shit.

301
00:26:02,839 --> 00:26:05,279
I'm almost impressed, Kid.

302
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,279
You could've got hurt
real bad out there, man.

303
00:26:09,319 --> 00:26:11,200
I could've got hurt
getting out of the bed.

304
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,119
True that, but we
got rules on the set.

305
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,799
You can't just roll
up through here

306
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,759
with no colors on,
pulling tricks, man.

307
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,160
People cutting you
some slack

308
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,079
'cause of your old man,
I'm tellin' ya.

309
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:22,720
Look, Kid, if you don't want
any problems, a'ight...

310
00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,240
What? You act like you're
about to do something.

311
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:26,759
Oh, I forgot.

312
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,960
I'm supposed to jump
when you say "jump"?

313
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,519
I'm not my father,
all right?

314
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:32,279
And what's that
supposed to mean?

315
00:26:32,319 --> 00:26:34,079
It means I'm not
kissing your ass

316
00:26:34,119 --> 00:26:35,119
the way he did.

317
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,240
Before he died

318
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:39,079
he said I should wish
to be as good as you are.

319
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:41,400
Well, he was wrong...

320
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,000
'cause I'm better.

321
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,160
Now would be a good time
for you to get on your bike

322
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,599
and take your ass home.

323
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:50,240
I can't do that, Smoke.

324
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,400
I'm calling your ass out!

325
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,240
Figured you'd bitch up.

326
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,000
One race...

327
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,000
and you talking shit? Hmm?

328
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,680
You want a piece of me,
Kid? Huh?

329
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,519
You want a piece of me?

330
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,200
Get you some colors,

331
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,359
you win you
some legit races,

332
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,359
and then,
maybe you'll get your shot.

333
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,240
When you step to me, Kid,
you better come correct.

334
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,519
Hey, Smoke.

335
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:39,319
Why don't you let me
handle this?

336
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,880
Some happy boy
comes through

337
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:44,640
messing up one of my events,
we got ways of dealing with him.

338
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,000
It's all right, T.J.

339
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,359
Kid was just
breaking out, y'all.

340
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,680
Ain't that right, Kid?

341
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,039
Oh, no doubt.

342
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,599
Come on, baby.

343
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:15,519
T.All right.

344
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,319
Let's get back to partying.

345
00:28:17,359 --> 00:28:19,680
Drinks on the house
for another hour.

346
00:28:58,359 --> 00:29:00,279
If you were gonna pull
some shit like that,

347
00:29:00,319 --> 00:29:01,880
you could've let
a brother know.

348
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,200
Hey, man, it just happened.

349
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,160
No, no!

350
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,160
Racing against
me doesn't

351
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,119
just happen... no, man, that's...
I mean...

352
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,920
We got paid, man.

353
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,640
What can I get you?

354
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,680
I'll have a Coke.

355
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,000
Anything else?

356
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,000
Yeah, I'll take a Coke
myself, sweetheart

357
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,000
and a cheeseburger.

358
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,480
I'm starving, yo!

359
00:29:21,519 --> 00:29:22,640
Wassup, Kid?

360
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,960
So, how you been,
Stuntman?

361
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,960
Who are you?

362
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,480
Oh, my name's Primo.

363
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:31,799
Dawgs, that was some gansta-ass
riding you did tonight, man!

364
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,480
Though I wonder
what Donny would think

365
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:36,319
if he knew the white boy
was your friend.

366
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:37,480
We ain't friends.

367
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,640
Oh, no?

368
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,480
Nah, we just like to
eat at the same place.

369
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:41,480
It's a
coincidence.

370
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:42,839
You know,
that's funny

371
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,000
'cause I know a little something
about coincidences.

372
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,359
Is that so?

373
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,960
Yeah. You'll
like this one.

374
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,880
Two months ago, some
brother rolls through

375
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,599
Los Vaqueros' annual
dance in Oaktown.

376
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,119
It's not unusual
for a black guy

377
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:54,680
to roll through
every now and then,

378
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,000
but what is unusual

379
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,839
is for this black guy
to tell Los Vaqueros

380
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,519
that a drunk white
boy wants to race?!

381
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,160
One who races
with no lid.

382
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,839
Man.

383
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,799
See, the guy who the white boy
happened to beat was my cousin.

384
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:08,960
That's a
coincidence.

385
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,440
Yeah, it is
a coincidence.

386
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,640
Look, man, y'all worked
y'all's game in Northern Cali,

387
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,200
and now you're gonna
squeeze out L.A.,

388
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,440
and I'm saying,
do your thing.

389
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,799
I feel that.

390
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:19,960
But I think y'all a little
too close to home, man,

391
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,920
to be using
that same-ass M.O.

392
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,759
Thank you for
the advice, Primer...

393
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,119
or Primo, whatever.

394
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,279
Look, man, if you had
a third guy, for example,

395
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:29,880
and ran a totally
different hustle...

396
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,119
Oh, oh.

397
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,400
...it'd keep people
off your ass.

398
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,759
I mean, shit,
all anyone has to do

399
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,319
is figure out where
the annual dance is,

400
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,480
and there you are.

401
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,119
Look, man,
we're not hustling no more.

402
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,119
Really?

403
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,000
Really.

404
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,839
We're going legit.

405
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,519
We are?

406
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,200
You're going after
Smoke's crown, aren't you?

407
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Oh, yeah, that's
what we're doing.

408
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:49,799
C-Can you tell this guy
he's crazy

409
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,000
so we can eat
in peace?

410
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,319
Yeah, tell me I'm crazy, Kid.

411
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:53,440
Tell me I'm crazy.

412
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:56,079
Look, man

413
00:30:56,119 --> 00:30:58,119
Smoke doesn't have
to chase any more wallets.

414
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,119
He's got the crown.

415
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,279
He's the King of Cali.

416
00:31:00,319 --> 00:31:01,319
Yeah, and...

417
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:02,880
And he told me
to step to him correctly,

418
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,880
so that's what
I'm doing.

419
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,039
I'm stepping
to him correctly.

420
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:06,119
Yeah, but the
only damn way

421
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,079
to step to
him correctly

422
00:31:07,119 --> 00:31:08,519
is to join one of
the clubs on set.

423
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:10,839
Actually, actually, actually...

424
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,519
actually...
there's another way.

425
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,000
We could start our own club.

426
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,039
"We"? "We"?

427
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,839
Yeah.

428
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
Yo, it takes three
to be official

429
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:23,039
and think about
how much money we can make

430
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,440
if we joined up together.

431
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
A lot more than $500
a race, believe me.

432
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,480
Well, believe this.

433
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,599
We can always find
a third head.

434
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,160
That's true, but you're
not gonna find nobody

435
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,160
as fast as me, Kid.

436
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,160
Come on, baby.

437
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,279
Well, maybe
if you can keep up,

438
00:31:33,319 --> 00:31:34,839
then we have something
we can talk about.

439
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,039
Keep up.

440
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:39,880
Hey, oh, nah...

441
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,359
Step up or
step off, son.

442
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:49,079
Step up or step off.
Step up or step off.

443
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,480
Yo, Stunt, let's show him
how to do it, baby.

444
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:01,480
Oh!

445
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,839
Come on, Primo!

446
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,319
You got blocks!
Keep up, son!

447
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:26,640
Come on, baby, let's go now!

448
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,480
Whoo!

449
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,240
Whoo!

450
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:25,400
My name's Primo.

451
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,799
You ain't gonna forget
that name.

452
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,839
What you think, Kid?

453
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,000
He got skills.

454
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,200
Way to step
up, son!

455
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,200
Ha, ha! Come on.

456
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,200
Yeah.

457
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,160
Hey, man!

458
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,160
- Whoo!
- Ow!

459
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,000
Ow.

460
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:49,119
Baby-girl, now you got
to make sure

461
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,240
that the, uh, "D"
is nice and straight.

462
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,240
Oh!

463
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,079
I mean, it's looking
a little crooked right here.

464
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,720
Wood? Move.

465
00:33:55,759 --> 00:33:57,039
What? I'm saying
you got to...

466
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,039
Move!

467
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,039
All right.
Look, here.

468
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,039
Hurry up.

469
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:02,200
I got to get back
to the shop, you know?

470
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,559
I'm still on
the clock.

471
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,440
Hey, sweetie,
I told you my sister

472
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,440
was a pro, right?

473
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,519
Uh-huh.

474
00:34:07,559 --> 00:34:09,280
She's gonna take care
of you. Mmm! Mmm.

475
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,360
Oh, baby?

476
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,880
Hmm?

477
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,519
You're gonna put my name
on yours, too, right?

478
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:14,519
What?

479
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:15,519
Well...

480
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,679
Uh, yeah, baby-boo.

481
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,400
I got you.
You know.

482
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,400
It hurts?

483
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,400
Yeah.

484
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,079
You can take
the pain.

485
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,880
You say you
like the look.

486
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,880
Wow. What's up, baby?

487
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,079
How did you...?

488
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,719
What-what in the hell
are you doing here?

489
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,519
Came to get me a tattoo.

490
00:34:34,559 --> 00:34:37,039
Okay, look, you
can't just stop by.

491
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,639
You have to make
an appointment.

492
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,199
You see me race
the other day?

493
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,039
Yeah. I saw you race.

494
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:46,039
I think you're crazy.

495
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,519
Well, I think
some people like crazy.

496
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,760
Look, I'm kind of busy,
so, um... um...

497
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,719
if you want to make
an appointment...

498
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,880
here.

499
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,119
You can call
my voice mail.

500
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:01,800
Your voice mail?

501
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,320
My voice mail.

502
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,960
A'ight.

503
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,480
Anything else?

504
00:35:06,519 --> 00:35:07,760
Yeah, um...

505
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:33,079
I wasn't trying to cause static
at the dance.

506
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,159
I was just trying
to show off my bike.

507
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:39,440
Things got out of control,
so, I apologize to you, T.J.

508
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,639
I understand that.

509
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,239
But, you see,
I ain't the only one

510
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,639
you should be apologizing to.

511
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,719
I apologize.

512
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,880
Word is you've
been kicking it

513
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,800
with that white boy
that raced Donny.

514
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,159
There a law against that?

515
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:06,800
No. Just wondering
if you met him

516
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,119
before the race or after.

517
00:36:08,159 --> 00:36:09,519
After.

518
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:12,199
'Cause we got a strict code
about hustling.

519
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:14,960
You either deal straight up,
or not at all.

520
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,599
I'm just as straight up as you.

521
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,480
So, you're taking

522
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:24,360
college classes
and fixing bikes part-time?

523
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,800
That's right.

524
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,039
Following in your
father's footsteps?

525
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:30,239
In some things.

526
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,840
All right, if we agree
to vote you in,

527
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,800
your club will
be recognized.

528
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,559
But if you're
not voted in

529
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,880
you can come again
before us in a year.

530
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,960
I understand that.

531
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,039
Good for you.

532
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,519
All those in favor of Kid's club
being recognized...

533
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,559
acknowledge.

534
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:11,159
So what y'all going
to call yourself?

535
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,920
You okay?

536
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,800
Yeah, I'm good.

537
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,519
Okay.

538
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,679
'Cause, um... I just thought

539
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,760
it might hurt a little.

540
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,679
No. It's all good.

541
00:37:47,719 --> 00:37:51,360
It kind of helps
if you breathe a little bit.

542
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,440
Just...

543
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,960
Breathe.

544
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,199
You know, Tina...

545
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,880
I'm really feeling you.

546
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,599
Feeling me?

547
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:09,760
Yeah.

548
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,079
You know, I mean,
I like you a lot.

549
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,480
Kid, how would you know that?

550
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:18,280
You hardly even know me.

551
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,920
I just know.

552
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,079
That's all, you know?

553
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,800
So, what does this mean?

554
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,039
Oh... uh...

555
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:35,639
It's something my dad,
uh... used to say.

556
00:38:35,679 --> 00:38:39,840
It means, uh, whatever,
whoever steps to you...

557
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:42,199
just remember who you are.

558
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:44,039
You know... keep it real.

559
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,199
I know about
what happened to him.

560
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:51,320
I'm sorry.

561
00:38:53,559 --> 00:38:56,480
Can't imagine how
you're dealing with it.

562
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,840
Life's jacked up.

563
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,360
You know, just, uh...

564
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,639
learn how to deal
with it, you know?

565
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,480
I guess so.

566
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:12,599
Yeah.

567
00:39:19,679 --> 00:39:23,119
Oh... I forgot to thank you
for my flowers.

568
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,599
Thank you.

569
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:29,320
You know, I never flowed
like that before.

570
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,559
Never... you know,
bought flowers

571
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,840
for a girl.

572
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,440
Yeah, I could tell.

573
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,840
Yeah?

574
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,800
Um...

575
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:48,800
Picked them out myself.

576
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,920
I can tell that, too.

577
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:08,920
Come here.

578
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,239
Come here.

579
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:37,400
Think of
the sexiest girl

580
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,159
Think of
the sexiest girl

581
00:40:38,199 --> 00:40:39,280
you ever seen
in your life...

582
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,639
the sexiest...
and I'm telling you

583
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:41,760
Shorty was sexier
than that.

584
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,960
And she was checking you out?

585
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,519
No, she was drooling
all over me, son.

586
00:40:44,559 --> 00:40:46,440
So, you know, I start
talking to Shorty, right?

587
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,639
She telling me
she been racing

588
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,719
for, like, two years,

589
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,599
and she want to race me
for 500 beans.

590
00:40:51,639 --> 00:40:53,000
Now, that sound
like easy money.

591
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:54,000
Yo, as fine as she is,

592
00:40:54,039 --> 00:40:55,239
I'm thinking
the same thing.

593
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,440
Only she ain't
got no money.

594
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:59,079
So, she says if I win,
I get whatever I want.

595
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:00,159
Whoa.

596
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:01,239
So, did you win?

597
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,280
What you think?

598
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,719
So, I takes her back
to the motel

599
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,840
to settle our debt, right?

600
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,280
And Shorty starts
kissing on me...

601
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,280
You know what
I'm saying?

602
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:08,800
Starts twirling
her tongue in my ear

603
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,320
and I'm saying, son,
that's my spot.

604
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,719
Don't twirl the tongue
in my ear.

605
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,360
No, that's a little more
than I need to know.

606
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,119
Hold up; you took her
back to the motel

607
00:41:16,159 --> 00:41:18,079
and you only got
a ear job?

608
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,159
Hee-hee-hee, shut up.

609
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:20,360
That ain't funny.

610
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,119
Anyway, so before I could
tell Shorty to chill,

611
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:24,280
she got me handcuffed
to the headboard like... blah!

612
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,719
- Oh...
- Nice.

613
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,360
Next thing I know, five
of her friends come storming in.

614
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,599
- Oh...
- Nice.

615
00:41:29,639 --> 00:41:32,000
No, see,
you're not hearing me, man.

616
00:41:32,039 --> 00:41:34,280
It's not coming
through your head.

617
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,280
This ain't no
S & M bruise.

618
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,679
They beat the shit out of me,

619
00:41:38,719 --> 00:41:40,320
stole my money,
stole my clothes...

620
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,159
and I had to ride home
butt-naked, yo.

621
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,559
And there was like this
big-ass traffic jam,

622
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:46,480
'cause everybody
got out they car

623
00:41:46,519 --> 00:41:48,440
to laugh at me.

624
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,000
I nearly burned my nuts off
on the way home.

625
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,280
Yo, man...

626
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,679
Yo, we a motorcycle club, right?

627
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,159
We supposed to stick together
at times like this, right?

628
00:41:58,199 --> 00:42:00,800
You're just going to
laugh at me like that?

629
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,199
Huh? At least help me
get my money back, man.

630
00:42:07,719 --> 00:42:09,360
That's messed up, man.

631
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,760
That's mad messed up.

632
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,960
On behalf of all
the club presidents,

633
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,159
we want to thank you
for coming out.

634
00:42:16,199 --> 00:42:19,599
This is our fourth annual
Bikini Bike Wash.

635
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:22,400
And every dime

636
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,880
raised here today
goes towards purchasing

637
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,000
schoolbooks for kids
in our community.

638
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,559
So, if you got a dirty bike,

639
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:35,199
this is where you want to be.

640
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:39,480
And if you got a clean bike,
this is where you want to be.

641
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,079
Now, please, give a warm welcome

642
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:47,920
to our motorcycle
sanitation engineers!

643
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:00,760
Come on.

644
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,039
Damn.

645
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,239
Come on. Come on.

646
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,159
Hang on, hang on, hang on!

647
00:43:09,199 --> 00:43:11,679
Before all you sisters
get too salty,

648
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,519
please say hello to Turbo.

649
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,559
Oh...!

650
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,920
No, no, no, no!

651
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,760
What?

652
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
Yo, man, that's what
I'm talking about.

653
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,880
Do they come any tighter,
them shorts he got on?

654
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,199
I ain't feeling that
right there.

655
00:43:33,239 --> 00:43:35,400
All they need
is the Train, baby!

656
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:37,960
All you need is the
chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a...

657
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,840
Soul Train!

658
00:43:55,239 --> 00:43:58,679
I think, um, you
need to cool off.

659
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:10,119
Hey, you... I see you.

660
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,239
If there's one bike out here

661
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:24,960
that doesn't need
to be cleaned, it's yours.

662
00:44:26,639 --> 00:44:28,719
Well, it's for charity.

663
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,440
Ah... charity.

664
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:33,119
Speaking of charity,
where's, um...

665
00:44:33,159 --> 00:44:36,480
uh... Donny?

666
00:44:36,519 --> 00:44:38,000
I really wouldn't know.

667
00:44:38,039 --> 00:44:39,559
Well, ain't
y'all involved?

668
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:45,199
Brothers and commitment.

669
00:44:45,239 --> 00:44:48,079
You know about that one,
don't you?

670
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:49,199
That again.

671
00:44:49,239 --> 00:44:51,000
Mmm. I suppose
it didn't help matters

672
00:44:51,039 --> 00:44:52,320
that I beat him in a race.

673
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,679
You could've let him win.

674
00:44:54,719 --> 00:44:56,960
Like I let you win?

675
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,559
Like you let me win?

676
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,639
Don't let me keep you, huh?

677
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:10,320
Wouldn't want you
to feel "smothered."

678
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:12,840
I'm up next.

679
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,840
Hey, yo, Kid!

680
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,639
These guys want
to talk to you.

681
00:45:17,679 --> 00:45:19,360
Hey, Kid, I'm Philly.

682
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
What's up, man?

683
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,000
- And I'm Flip.
- What's going on?

684
00:45:22,039 --> 00:45:23,440
Yo, we saw you race
Donny a while back.

685
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:24,920
Yo, we saw you beat
Big Gee a week ago.

686
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,000
Your flow was
off the chain.

687
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:27,000
Off the heezy.

688
00:45:27,039 --> 00:45:29,079
Yo, now that you got
your own crew and all,

689
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:30,639
we was hoping to join up.

690
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,800
What?

691
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,159
I mean, we know
that we got to be

692
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,320
prospects for a while,

693
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,280
but whatever it takes to become
Biker Boyz, we'll do it.

694
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,039
- Whatever it takes?
- No doubt.

695
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,400
Don't jump, Smoke.

696
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,239
It can't be that bad.

697
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,519
Well, if it ain't Dogg...

698
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,159
"man's best friend."

699
00:46:14,199 --> 00:46:16,760
Hey! Hey! Fetch!

700
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,400
Why don't you hang it up?

701
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:20,599
You haven't raced
anybody credible

702
00:46:20,639 --> 00:46:21,920
since the accident.

703
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,880
Oh, that's 'cause
you think

704
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,519
you're the only one
who's credible.

705
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,679
Think?

706
00:46:27,719 --> 00:46:30,039
Only reason you beat me
up in Fresno

707
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,239
is 'cause my piston
got jacked up.

708
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,880
That shit
ain't happening again.

709
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,480
Good. You need to get in
line and wait your turn

710
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:37,599
like everybody else.

711
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:38,880
Ain't nobody else,

712
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,360
except you.

713
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:45,320
I been watching you...
riding safe, careful...

714
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,800
not taking any chances.

715
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:50,079
You ain't got the heart
to be King of Cali.

716
00:46:50,119 --> 00:46:52,320
Not no more.

717
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,239
I can see that
in your eyes.

718
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:57,519
You sure that's
what you see?

719
00:46:57,559 --> 00:47:00,199
Look again.

720
00:47:00,239 --> 00:47:04,719
I'll tell you what
you see, you mutt.

721
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,119
You see somebody who's
got everything you want.

722
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,519
Somebody who's
got three Gs

723
00:47:08,519 --> 00:47:10,800
that says you ain't got
the heart to take it.

724
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:14,440
Three Gs?

725
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:15,960
How about five?

726
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,800
How about five?

727
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:20,079
Five, baby.

728
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:25,159
Wait up!

729
00:49:21,719 --> 00:49:23,239
You see that?
You see that?

730
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,840
Go! Come on! Yeah!

731
00:49:51,719 --> 00:49:55,239
Baby, that's what
I'm talking about.

732
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,039
Ooh! Ooh!

733
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:02,119
That's right.
Give it up.

734
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:04,159
Get your little ass
on over there, homeboy.

735
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,719
Where there's smoke,
there's fire!

736
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,760
- Fire!
- Fire!

737
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:21,920
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

738
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,920
Say something for the people
at home, baby.

739
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,599
Get out of my face
with that camera!

740
00:50:25,639 --> 00:50:27,480
Yo, Dogg, now that's
what I call a race.

741
00:50:27,519 --> 00:50:28,559
Couldn't get no closer.

742
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:31,079
Yo, baby, say something
for the folks at home, man.

743
00:50:31,159 --> 00:50:32,599
Let them know
what's going on, Dogg.

744
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:34,280
Just a little something
for them, baby.

745
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:38,079
Damn, Kamera Man.

746
00:50:38,119 --> 00:50:39,360
You next, fool.

747
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,400
You next.

748
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:41,639
You got smoked, baby.

749
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,280
Don't even sweat that, man.

750
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,239
Don't even sweat it.

751
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,519
Soul Train?

752
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:47,599
Yes, sir?

753
00:50:47,639 --> 00:50:49,679
How much does that doggy
in the window owe me?

754
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:51,679
His life, Smoke.

755
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:52,920
He owe you his life.

756
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,679
That's a good Dogg.

757
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:03,920
Hey, ain't you
forgetting something?

758
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,639
Come on, boy.

759
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:11,280
Come on, you
can do it, boy.

760
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,440
Come on, boy.

761
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:14,360
Here, boy! Here, boy!

762
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,360
Come on.

763
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,400
That's a good Dogg.

764
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,760
That's a good Dogg.

765
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:21,639
Come on!

766
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:26,960
Why don't you fetch that?

767
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:30,519
Bad Dogg.

768
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:32,280
That ain't no dog, Smoke.

769
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,400
That's a bitch.

770
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,400
That's a doggone shame.

771
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:42,679
We gonna tell you
a little story here.

772
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:43,719
You want to hear that?

773
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,960
Tell you a little story
about a boy named Dogg.

774
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,599
Quarter mile race,
need to be up on a hog.

775
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,639
Then one day
he came against the Smoke.

776
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,159
Got to the line
and all he did was choke.

777
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:55,639
Smoked, that is.

778
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,639
Black Knight!

779
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,000
That's right. Keep going.

780
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,760
I thought you were
supposed to race before me.

781
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:02,960
We were.

782
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,199
I guess you're
not the only one

783
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:07,440
who likes to make
an entrance.

784
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:18,119
T.J.

785
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:41,920
Let's ride.

786
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,079
Can't do it.

787
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,480
Can't hold the bridge
any longer.

788
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:46,599
What?

789
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:49,480
Maybe next time you'll
leave out the halftime show.

790
00:53:49,519 --> 00:53:52,920
Maybe next time
you'll take some notes.

791
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:54,440
We racing?

792
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,960
Or you making upan excuse?
