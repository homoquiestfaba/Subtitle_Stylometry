00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,330
<i>SEPTEMBER 1989</i>

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,100
I saw all of us

4
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:33,930
All of us were there, back in the cistern

5
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,700
But we were older.
We were our parents ages.

6
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
Am I still handsome as an adult?

7
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,830
- You grow into your looks.
- What the fuck does that mean?

8
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,300
What about me?

9
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,700
Like now; but taller.

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:09,100
Swear it... Swear if IT isn't dead

11
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:14,300
If IT ever comes back, we'll come back too.

12
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,230
Memory, it's a funny thing

13
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,400
People want to believe they are
what they choose to remember

14
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,100
The good stuff

15
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,500
The moments

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,730
The places

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The people we all hold on to

18
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:48,330
But sometimes

19
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,300
Sometimes, we are what we wish to forget.

<i>27 YEARS LATER</i>

21
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,730
Okay, kids. Get ready, GO!

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,600
First one to pop their balloon's a winner

23
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,930
It could be anyone.
We've got a real barn-burner here.

24
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,760
It's so close,
who's gonna catch the leader, huh?

25
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,360
Who's gonna be the big winner tonight?
- Oh yeah!

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:46,300
- Winner, winner, a chicken dinner.
- You really showed them.

27
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:47,730
I did.

28
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,700
Hey girl... you want this?

29
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,800
Thanks for letting me win.

30
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,430
What did you get, Vickie?

31
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,700
Well... Here is your consolation prize.

32
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:10,230
Look at that.
I have never been a fan of the beaver.

33
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,900
But look at this hat, great.

34
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,730
Thank you.

35
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:20,230
So, we need to talk logistics.

36
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,700
- How romantic.
- Romantic?

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,530
What's so fucking romantic, huh?

38
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,230
Hey.

39
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,360
Your mamas ever teach you boys to responds to
someone when they ask you a fucking question

40
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,700
Come on, Adrian.

41
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,200
Got a problem, faggot?

42
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't but Meg Ryan called.

43
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,330
She wants here wig back

44
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,760
All right, all right,
come on, come on, Adrian.

45
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,700
Stuff like that is why I have to
leave this shithole town. Small minds.

46
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,830
- They have small dicks.
- I'm serious.

47
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,960
We belong elsewhere.

48
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:07,500
Look if you end up hating New York,
we could always move back here

49
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,600
I just want to be with you. I don't
care if it's in New York or in Derry,

50
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:11,560
Whatever it is, it is...

51
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,360
- You have to say it.
- I don't have to say anything.

52
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,860
- Take off that fucking hat.
- Come on.

53
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,760
We don't want to give people the impression that we
allow a bunch of fucking fairies like you in this town

54
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:24,100
- He was born here, asshole.
- Alright, let's go.

55
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,930
No, you know what?
I'll take off the hat for you,

56
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,060
But why leave it there?

57
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,660
Anything else you would like me
to take off for you, tonight?

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,460
Any special requests, ladies?

59
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,960
- Fucker.
- Let him go!

60
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,130
- What's that? -Stop.
- I don't think you'll be needing that.

61
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,860
- Leave him alone!
- Hit him.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,800
He's got asthma, fucker!

63
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:06,000
Come on. Fuck him up!

64
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,300
- Come on, kick him. Come on!
Kick the shit outta him! -Adrian!

65
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,160
I still hate your fucking hair.

66
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:21,430
Adrian!

67
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:24,600
Get the fuck off of him

68
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,030
Look what you did to his fucking face.

69
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:30,400
Hey, hey!

70
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,030
- Help me get him up.
- Adrian!

71
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,400
Help me get this fucking punk
up, right now.

72
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,930
Give me that hat, Chris.

73
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:45,960
- It's fucking mine.
- Give me the fucking hat!

74
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,960
Adrian!

75
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,000
Welcome to Derry, you fucker.

76
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:59,230

<i>Come back. You say "dismembered"?</i>

93

<i>That's affirmative. It was found

- All good?
- This way.

- C'mon You ever see Indiana Jones?
- Watch your back.

101
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,900
- Hey, hey, you a crew member?
- I'm... the... writer.

102
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,500
- Your husband is here.
- Hey, do you have the pages?

103
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,760
My friend, a film needs an ending.

104
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
- You do know that, right?
- Oh yeah.

105
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,130
You said that you needed
another day to finish the pages.

106
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,460
- We're shooting this thing, it's tonight.
- It's been 17 hours.

107
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,370
- Everyone calm down, okay?
- I'm calm.

108
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
I want you to be happy with the movie.

109
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,400
Do you get understand I am on your side.

110
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,530
That's, that's great,
because in my book the ending...

111
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,830
Is terrible.

112
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,300
All due respect, people loved your
book, loved but they hated the ending.

113
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:14,400
- You said you liked the ending.
- That was a lie.

114
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:16,760
- We have to do better, okay?
- Yeah.

115
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,260
Audra, you have my notes, could you?

116
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,460

- Not all of your endings, but this...

120

- Okay.
- Just...

121
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:39,000
- What? Do you want me to keep lying to
you just because I'm... -You're my wife?

122
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,700
No, no but you've been blowing
smoke up my ass for eight years.

123
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,730
- I guess I just thought you were someone else.
- I have not been blowing smoke up your ass.

124
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,460
Everyone wants a happy ending.
Everyone wants closure.

125
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:54,130
- But that's not the way life works out.
- Think what Peter wants, no, what the studio wants.

126
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,260
Studio? When did you become a company man?
You're an artist.

127
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,160
C'mon what wrong with just doing it the
way it's written? The way I want it.

128
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,310

the woman I want you to be?

- You shouldn't be out there.

137

Eddie, it's not safe to drive on
when the roads are slick like this.

138
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,630
Sweetheart, it stopped raining like three
hours ago. Everything's gonna be fine.

- Hey! Dickhead, flow of traffic mean anything to you?
- What if you hydroplane?

140
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,900
I'm not gonna hydroplane.

more likely to get into an accident

- Eddie, you okay?
- Yeah, pretty good.

155
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:52,060
What the fuck! You were fine like five
seconds ago. Who was that? Who called?

156
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,260
Rich, talk to me.
You're on in two minutes. You good?

160

- 60 seconds.
- Even faster.

161
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,830
- Bring him a bottle of water.
- Bourbon.

162
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,330
Sure. And a mint.

163
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,430
I don't think I can do this.
And that was fast.

164
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,300
Okay. Rich, where are you going?

masturbating to her friend's Facebook page

172
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,060
And so now I am in Masturbators Anonymous.

173
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,960
I stand up at the first meeting and say:

174
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:58,900
"My name is Richie Trashmouth."

175
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,130
Trashmouth...

176
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:09,400
I forgot the joke.

177
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:12,100
You suck!!!!

178
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,630
Thank you ladies and gentlemen,
for letting us present to you today

179
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:22,600
Now this will include over
a million square feet of

180
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,130
Commercial and residential space.
State of the art office towers.

181
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:32,400
What I am really looking for is to understand how
we can create even more retail opportunities

182
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,260
- If we put in walls here and all along here...
- Lose them.

183
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,230
- With all due respect, Mr. Hanscom.
- Ben, please and with all due respect to you...

184
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,900
I'm getting claustrophobic just
looking at this model. Aren't you?

185
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,560
Look, throw up more walls,
it's gonna look like a prison.

186
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,330
And you know what people want
to do in prison? Get out, right!

187
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:59,330
It should be a place that
brings people together.

188
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,430
Meeting ground

189
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,300
A Club House

190
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:14,860
And if while people are there

191
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,630
Excuse me for one second

192
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,830
- Hello.
- Ben, it's Mike Hanlon from Derry.

193
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,400
Should I just book it?

194
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:53,900
- You sure you can get away from work?
- It's summer, why not?

195
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,800
Okay, we are Buenos Aires bound.

196
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,300
Stanley Uris speaking

197
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,060
- It's Mike.
- I'm sorry?

198
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,660
<i>Mike Hanlon from Derry.</i>

199
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,660
Mike, god, sorry. Yes, hi.

200
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,460
I didn't, I don't know why I...

201
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,500
- How long has it been?
- A long time

202
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,000
<i>27 years.</i>

203
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,760
It's come back, hasn't it?
That's why you're calling me?

204
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:52,630
It's starting again,
Stan and bad things are happening.

205
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,500
Did you call the others?
What if they don't come? I mean...

206
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,700
We made a promise, remember?
How soon can you get here?

207
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,330
- Well, uhm, uh. I would need to do a few things.
- Tomorrow?

208
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,530
<i>We don't have much time.</i>

209
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
<i>I'll text you everything you'll need.</i>

210
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,900
I'll see you soon, Stan the man.

211
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,930
(no audio) Do you swear?

212
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,760
I swear, Bill.

213
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,100
- You made a promise, Beverly.
- I'm so sorry, Mike.

214
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,060
I don't even really remember.

215
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,660
Haven't you even wondered why
you can't seem to remember things

216
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,030
that most people should,
about where they're from, who they are.

217
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,960
<i>Why you have that scar on your hand?</i>

218
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:16,960
<i>No one else remembered it either.
Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie.</i>

219
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:19,300
- Bill.
- Bill?

220
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,600
You have to come back.

221
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:28,060
- You all do.
- When?

222
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:48,000
Whoa, are you okay? What's going on?

223
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,860
It's uh, the middle of the night.
You're packing?

224
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,630
I didn't want to wake you, honey.
I know this week's been really exhausing.

225
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:59,230
I just go a phone call from
an old friend from Derry.

226
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,260
I have to go back there.

227
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:06,930
- It's really hard to explain why.
- It's okay.

228
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,800
You don't have to explain
yourself to me. Relax.

229
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,060
- I trust you.
- Thank you.

230
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,530
I just don't understand
why you'd lie to me.

231
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:31,800
I heard you. You said the name Mike.

232
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:35,260
Yes my friend.
There was a group of us back then

233
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:37,760
and we all made a promise to
each other when we were kids.

234
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,800
You know that trust is everything in our
relationship. You know that's everything to me.

235
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,760
Right?

236
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:47,960
- I know, it isn't...
- What? The last time?

237
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:52,460
- I never cheated on you and...
- You're a bad fucking liar, Bev.

238
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,330
You're not going anywhere, okay?
I want you to stay right here

239
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,000
and you're gonna show me what it is
you're going to do with Mike, okay?!

240
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,560
You're hurting me, honey.

241
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,260
No one else is gonna love you like me.
You know that, right?

242
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,060
I'm sorry.

243
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,160
- Don't make this fucking harder!

244
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:46,930
You're nothing without me!
You know it, right?

245
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,960
<i>Tell me I'm wrong!</i>

246
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,230
Jesus Christ, boys!

247
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,630
Little prick's got balls, I'll give
him that. That's far enough, Bowers.

248
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,960
- I'm not done yet, I'm not done, I not fucking done.
- On your knees!

249
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,660
No, I got to kill them all!

250
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,960
Fucking kill them all! Stop! Fuck you!

251
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,900
Cuff this sorry sack of shit.
- Fuck you!

252
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,200
Henry Bowers, I am placing you under
arrest for the murder of Oscar Bowers.

253
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,160
Do you understand, dipshit?

254
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,960
You have the right to an attorney.

255
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
You have the right to remain silent.

256
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,230
Anything you say can and will be
used against you, in a Court of law

257
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,560
Bowers!

258
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,600
Bowers, calm the fuck down.

259
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,400
Someone needs a little
extra clozapine today, huh?

260
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,660
Stay in your fucking room.

261
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,960
Hockstetter?

262
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:46,630
My knife

263
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,200
Careful, this way

264
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,900
Thanks alot

265
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,830
Hey

266
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:15,260
- Mike, you look good.
- Hey, how you doing?

267
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,500
Bill

268
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:20,900
I didn't know if any of you would
(indiscernible) after all of this time.

269
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,530
- But of course you came.
- An oath is a oath.

270
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,700
The losers...

271
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:31,300
- Gotta stick together, right?
- The losers? You remember that.

272
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,960
That's good. What else do you remember?

273
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,800
I'm allergic to soy,
anything that has egg in it, gluten

274
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:42,530
And if I eat a cashew,
I could realistically die.

275
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,730
Holy shit!

276
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,800
Is there a password or something?

277
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:08,760
- I'm sor...
- The "<i>New Kid</i>".

278
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,600
- Ben?
- Yeah

279
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:17,330
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

280
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,460
It's been so long.

281
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:26,000
<i>Stay cool, Ben from soc class.</i>

282
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,400
<i>- You too, Beverly.
- Hang Tough, new kid on the block.</i>

283
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,930
Wow! You two look amazing.
What the fuck happened to me?

284
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,160
- Hey, I'm Ben.
- Richie.

285
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,590
Yes, and Bev

286
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,060
- Hi.
- Hey

287
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,630
Is it me or has the Losers
Club officially begun.

288
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:51,590
Look at these guys.

289
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:56,590
(No audio) Ben

290
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:05,330
- So wait, Eddie, you got married?
- Why's it so fucking funny, dickwad?

291
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:07,790
- What, to like a woman?
- Fuck you bro.

292
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:11,030
- Fuck you!
- Alright and what about you, Trashmouth? You married?

293
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,390
- There is no way!
- No, I got married!

294
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,860
- Rich, I don't believe it.
- When?

295
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,370
- You didnt' hear this.
You didn't know I got married?

296
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:18,690
- You do not know?
- No.

297
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,190
Me and your mom are very,
very happy right now.

298
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,430
Terribly happy

299
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:26,990
- He totally fell for it.
- Fuck you!

300
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,230
She is very sweet. Sometimes she'll put her arm
around me and whisper (speaks like Jabba the Hut)...

301
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:39,830
We all get it, my mom was a
very big fat person. Hilarious.

302
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,060
Hysterical

303
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:44,930
Yes, it is a nice watch.

304
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:48,160
Let's talk about the
elephant not in the room. Ben

305
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:52,390
- What the fuck, man?
- Okay, okay obviously I lost a few pounds.

306
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:55,730
- Lost a few pounds. -No shit, lost a few...
- You're like a, you're hot!

307
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,360
You're like every Brazilian soccer
player wrapped up into one person

308
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:03,190
- Leave him alone, you're embarrassing him.
- Okay, okay, alright, please.

309
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:03,830
Come on!

310
00:29:03,890 --> 00:29:05,760
Is Stanley coming or what?

311
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,830
Stanley

312
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:15,560
- Stanley Uris.
- Yes.

313
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,090
Stanley Urine No, He's a fucking
pussy, he's not going to show.

314
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:21,000
Why would Stanley save you, anyway?

315
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:25,230
Was I not the one who basically performed
surgery on you when Bowers cut you up

316
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,490
- Holy Shit, that's right.
- Please tell me you ended up becoming a doctor, Eds?

317
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:32,130
No, I ended up becoming a risk analyst.

318
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:34,590
Oh that sounds really interesting,
what does that entail?

319
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,260
Yes. I work for like a big insurance
firm and uh... (Richie snoring)

320
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,490
Fuck you, dude. Fuck you!

321
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,740
Was this job invented before fun?

322
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
That's so not funny.

323
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,790
It is funny.

324
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:58,030
- What the fuck are you laughing at?
- I propose a toast.

325
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:00,760
To the losers.

326
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,730
Aw here we go. Thank you.

327
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,830
Logan-Marsh, half my wife's closet,
that Logan-Marsh. That's huge.

328
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,560
That's our line, me and my husband, Tom.

329
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:28,960
How long you been married?

330
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,060
- Hey, we saw your movie.
- Seriously?

331
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:37,030
- By the way, It was so good, it was so scary.
- And the ending sucked?

332
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:41,690
- Yeah, it did, I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

333
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:50,390
- What?
- This is just weird.

334
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:56,960
All this. All these memories and people
that I don't even remember forgetting.

335
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,890
I mean it's weird, right?

336
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:07,190
Now that we're all here, everything just
comes back faster. Faster, I mean all of it.

337
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:11,690
- Yes.
- When Mike called me, I threw up.

338
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:16,130
Isn't that weird?
I got nervous, sick and threw up.

339
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:20,490
I'm feel fine now. I feel very
relieved to be here with you guys.

340
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:24,560
- Why are you looking at me like this?
- When Mike called me, I crashed my car.

341
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,030
- Seriously?
- Yes.

342
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,360
Man, I hear ya. I mean my heart was literally
like pounding right outta my chest.

343
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:34,560
- I thought it was only me.
- It was like...

344
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,830
pure (stuttering) fear.

345
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,430
It was fear, what you felt.

346
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,230
Why do we all feel like that, Mike?

347
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,260
You remember something we
don't, don't you, Mike?

348
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:52,590
Something happens to you
when you leave this town.

349
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,590
The farther away, the hazier it gets.

350
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:58,190
But me, I never left.

351
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:02,630
So, yeah, I remember...

352
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,830
I remember all of it.

353
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,160
Pennywise

354
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,890
- oh the fucking clown.
- Oh shit.

355
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,230
Pennywise...

356
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:20,260
Mike, you said you wanted our help
with something. What was that?

357
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:24,330
There's an echo, here in Derry,
that bounces back every 27 years.

358
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,390
- What are you talking about?
- Hold on, listen, listen.

359
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,860
We thought we stopped IT back
then, we thought it was done.

360
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,360
- Mike.
- A week ago...

361
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:39,690
A man, Adrian Mellon, slaughtered. A girl,
Lisa Aubrich, the other night went missing.

362
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:44,360
- There already others and there will be more.
- You know what happened?

363
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,630
- Take it easy. -Can I get another drink?
- Let him explain.

364
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,490
That echo, we might have changed it.

365
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,690
Just like it changed us,
but we didn't stop it.

366
00:32:58,260 --> 00:33:00,190
Because it just bounced back.

367
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:03,790
We made an oath.

368
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:07,590
That's why I brought you back.
That's why you're here.

369
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,960
To finish it, for good.

370
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,890
Well, that shit darkened fast.
Thanks, Mike.

371
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:22,230
My fortune cookie just says "could."

372
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,040
They don't know how to
do fortune cookies here,

373
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,190
Mine just says "Guess."

374
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:29,030
You wanna throw that over here.

375
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
What do you got, Mike?

376
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,430
What is it?

377
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:46,330
- Guess, cut, could, not, it
- It's a message.

378
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:50,790
Guess it could not cut.
That makes no sense.

379
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:54,190
- What does that mean?
- I don't know what that means.

380
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,460
- (overlapping voices).
- It could not guess.

381
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,230
That means that. Are you talking about him?

382
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,460
- When it talks about it, does it mean it?
- Mike, where is this going?

383
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,590
Is that what IT means?

384
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,490
I do not know.

385
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,280
Did you fuck with the
fortune cookies, Mike?

386
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,630
- Let him speak.
- This is not me. This is what...

387
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,390
- IT does. -I need my fucking inhaler?
What is wrong with you man?

388
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:20,230
Why are you messing with us?
This is so not funny.

389
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,360
Why does it say Stanley?
Will someone else fucking answer me.

390
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,960
Oh shit.

391
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,430
Shit.

392
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,290
(Bev screams) -What is that?

393
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:12,060
- What the fuck is that, man?
- Oh my god.

394
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:29,760
Shit.

395
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,560
Hey, hey!

396
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,430
That fortune cookie's looking at me!

397
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:42,630
I do not want to be here.
I want to go home. I do not care.

398
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:47,060
I do not want to be here. Holy shit!

399
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,090
Whoa, hey, goddammit!

400
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,490
Eddie!

401
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:15,960
It's not real!

402
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,190
It's not real! (repeating)

403
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:27,690
It's not real!

404
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,760
Is everything alright?

405
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,130
Yeah, can we get the check?

406
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:43,160
That's what Pennywise does, He fucks
with us. So Stanley's probably fine.

407
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,530
- Wait, Mike,
do you have Stan's number? -Yeah.

408
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,530
<i>Hey Richie!</i>

409
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:52,530
How do you know my name?

410
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,760
The fun's just beginning, right?

411
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:06,090
- What did he say?
- Do you think this is funny?

412
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,890
Do you think this is some sort of game?

413
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,060
- Huh? Well, fuck you, alright!
- Rich, be careful.

414
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,730
Fuck you! I am not afraid of you!

415
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:17,690
The fun's just beginning,
the line from your act, dude.

416
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,590
- I'm a fan.
- Those your parents?

417
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:20,990
Yeah

418
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,790
- Do you want a picture?
- Are you okay, Dean?

419
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:28,060
- I think I'm good.
- Okay, well, cute kid.

420
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:32,060
Jesus, Richie. Don't you remember
a line from your own show?

421
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,990
I don't write my own material.

422
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,930
I fucking knew it!!! I fucking knew it!!!!

423
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:41,030
Hello Mrs. Uris. My name's Beverly Marsh

424
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:44,590
I apologize for calling,
but I am an old friend of your husbands.

425
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,430
You lied to us. This is not OK.

426
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:50,090
The first words out of your mouth should have been like
"Hey man, you want to come to Derry and like get murdered?"

427
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:52,630
- Cause I would have said no.
- Guys

428
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:53,730
Fucking entrapment

429
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,760
<i>Oh, uh he passed.</i>

430
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:03,660
- When did it happen?
- Yesterday.

431
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,930
<i>It was so horrible, the way he died .</i>

432
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,930
- his wrists.
- (both simultaneously) In the bathtub

433
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:17,430
<i>I'm sorry, I have to, have to go.</i>

434
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:21,790
- We're all very sorry.
- Thank you.

435
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,730
Stanley

436
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,590
- Pennywise knew, he knew before we did.
- We have to stop it.

437
00:38:31,690 --> 00:38:34,330
- I have a plan.
- I have a plan getting the fuck outta dodge

438
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:37,360
Before it ends worse than one
of Bill's books. Who's with me?

439
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:40,690
- We made a promise to each other.
- Let's unmake, unmake the promise.

440
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:42,130
Richie, other people are gonna die.

441
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:45,990
Other people die everyday, man,
we don't owe this town shit.

442
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:49,060
Plus I just remembered that I
grew up here like two hours ago

443
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,860
So I'm fucking leaving, fuck this!

444
00:38:51,930 --> 00:38:54,060
I'm sorry, I agree with Richie.

445
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:58,130
- Guys, please.
- Listen what we stay, we die. That's it?

446
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,890
I'm gonna go back to the inn. I'm gonna pack
up my shit and I'm gonna drive to my home.

447
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,160
- Sorry man, good luck.
- Eddie, please, please, Eddie, wait!

448
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:11,590
You okay?

449
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,490
- I'm gonna head back with the rest too, you coming?
- Yeah.

450
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,560
- You should have told us, Mikey.
- Bill.

451
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,090
Please man, I'm begging you, please.
Just listen to me, man,

452
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:25,860
Please!

453
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,130
What are you going to say?

454
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,730
What can you possibly say that'll
make any kind of a difference?

455
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,890
They all have gone

456
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,060
Let me, let me show you something.

457
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,130
One thing.

458
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,530
And if you want to leave, you can leave.

459
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:42,030
But let me show you this first, please.

460
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,190
- My mom swings better than you.
- Stop.

461
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:56,560
He doesn't even play baseball. You suck!

462
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,160
- Mom, how much longer?
- Victoria, we came watch the game,

463
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,960
we're gonna watch the game.

464
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:16,030
<i>(Chanting)</i> Go Derry go! Go Derry go!

465
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,590
Hello Vickie.

466
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:12,290
Isn't that what your friends call
you, Vickie?

467
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:17,490
How did I know that,
I guess I must be your friend too.

468
00:41:18,730 --> 00:41:21,530
If you are my friend,
why are you hiding in the dark?

469
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:26,560
You are not my friend. You're scary.

470
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,190
Why are you crying?

471
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:43,060
People always make fun
cause of the way I look.

472
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,030
I thought if you couldn't see my face,

473
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,360
Then maybe you'd want to be my friend.

474
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:54,460
Uhhh never mind.

475
00:41:55,360 --> 00:42:00,090
Oh silly old Pennywise,
you'll never have no friends.

476
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:04,660
- People make fun of me too.
- They do?

477
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:07,930
Cause of this.

478
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,630
Isn't that silly?

479
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,090
For that little thing.

480
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,460
I could blow that thing right away.

481
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:24,260
- You could?
- Oh yes, one poof and it'll be gone.

482
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,490
Oh, but you would have to get
close enough to see my face.

483
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,930
I don't know, Vickie.

484
00:42:33,030 --> 00:42:36,060
No, it's okay. I won't make fun, I promise.

485
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,930
Promise, promise?

486
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:41,890
Okey-dokey!

487
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:46,490
Come in a little closer and we'll
blow it away on the count of three.

488
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:52,790
One.

489
00:42:53,830 --> 00:42:57,060
Two.

490
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,060
You're supposed to say three...

491
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:42,730
The fuck!?
- Boo!

492
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:00,230
Fuck, yeah!

493
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:05,960
Hey, Hockstetter. let's go!

494
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:27,930
- Let's get our shit and get the fuck outta here.
- Did you leave your stuff here?

495
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,260
No, my stuff's still in the car.

496
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:46,360
- Tell me.
- Tell you what?

497
00:44:47,030 --> 00:44:49,890
Whatever it is you're
afraid to tell me right now.

498
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:57,530
Bev, Bev, back at the Jade when you
were on the phone with Stanley's wife...

499
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,830
She told you that she
found him in the bathtub,

500
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:06,560
But, Bev, I saw you.
I heard that you said it first.

501
00:45:08,030 --> 00:45:11,460
Whatever you guys are talking about lets
make it happen fast, alright we gotta go.

502
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:15,760
- Eduardo, andale, let's go!
- There's something you're not telling us.

503
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:18,790
You knew how Stanley died. You knew.

504
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:23,190
- Wait, what?
- I can't do this.

505
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,160
She knew how Stanley was gonna
die, is that what she just said?

506
00:45:27,490 --> 00:45:31,430
You can't just walk away from this.
How did you know where he killed himself?

507
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:33,490
Bev?

508
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,090
Talk to me, just talk to me
like we used to. -Come on!

509
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:38,830
How did you know?

510
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,690
Because I saw it.

511
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,990
I've seen all of us die.

512
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,660
I just got to get my
toiletry bag and we can go.

513
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,030
What did I miss?

514
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,090
The library?

515
00:46:13,830 --> 00:46:15,790
Didn't this place used to be bigger?

516
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:30,530
Yo. Mike, where did you go?

517
00:46:56,090 --> 00:47:00,190
- Mike, do you live here?
- Yeah, make yourself at home.

518
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,730
- Do you want some water?
- Sure.

519
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:18,990
Memory's the thing...

520
00:47:19,830 --> 00:47:22,560
it's the key, the key to everything.

521
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:26,630
If IT really wants us
(stuttering) back here

522
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,190
Don't you think the smartest thing we
can do is get the hell outta Derry?

523
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,690
No, no, no. IT does want us back.

524
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:34,860
Of course IT does, but IT doesn't
know that I know what I know.

525
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:37,460
- What do you know?
- How to kill the shit out of him.

526
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:39,760
I've read every book

527
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:42,690
And I talked to every person
in this god-forsaken town.

528
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:45,860
Everybody that would talk to me anyway
and that's that's not a long list.

529
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:49,260
But it wasn't enough, I didn't know

530
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,860
How it all started.

531
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,530
How IT started...

532
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:02,360
And IT started... here.

533
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:06,630
- Whoa what am I looking at Mike?
- It's an artifact.

534
00:48:07,390 --> 00:48:12,130
- Early 18th century, Shakopee.
- Shakopee, how'd you get it?

535
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,790
I found it. They gave, gave it to me.

536
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,860
- I stole it.
- You stole it?

537
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,230
- From Native Americans?
- It's complicated.

538
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:26,690
- Yeah it is.
- They helped me on my journey.

539
00:48:26,990 --> 00:48:31,190
- Its so beautiful.
- They showed me things, a vision.

540
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:37,790
I feel kinda funky. Hot...

541
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:42,060
- Am I'm sweating?
- I need you to see what they showed me, Bill (echoing)

542
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:50,230
<i>They lived outside of Derry.
Beyond ITs reach.</i>

543
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:52,860
<i>They moved there many years ago.</i>

544
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:57,230
<i>They're holy men,
they're holy of holiest...</i>

545
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,390
<i>They took me in.</i>

546
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:04,590
<i>Fed me their sacred drink.</i>

547
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,330
<i>I started to... to react.</i>

548
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:11,990
All living things must abide by the laws of

549
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,390
the shape they inhabit.

550
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:23,460
While I sat there looking out
over the valley, I saw IT arrive

551
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:31,290
I knew that one day I would
have to make you all see.

552
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:32,490
Mike?

553
00:49:34,360 --> 00:49:36,260
Did you put something in my drink?

554
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,290
- That's uh... It's a root.
- You?

555
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:44,890
- You drugged me?
- No, it's a root with properties

556
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,040
It's a just micro dose of
what the Shakopee gave me.

557
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,890
Why would you do that?

558
00:49:47,990 --> 00:49:51,190
- To open your eyes.
- I don't feel real good..

559
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:54,590
I need you ...To look.

560
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:59,260
- And you will see.
- I don't feel good.

561
00:50:01,390 --> 00:50:02,960
<i>They showed me the past.</i>

562
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,730
<i>They showed me the way IT appeared to them.</i>

563
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:27,160
<i>They showed me their pain.</i>

564
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,830
<i>They showed me how to stop it.</i>

565
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,290
You okay?

566
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:50,830
Did you see it, the ritual?

567
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:53,890
- The ritual of Chüd.
- I knew it. I knew you would see.

568
00:50:55,430 --> 00:50:59,890
- I saw the whole fucking thing Mike.
- That's how we kill IT

569
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:11,960
How are we gonna do it?
Everybody already said no.

570
00:51:12,730 --> 00:51:17,860
With you, they'll listen.

571
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:21,860
This will work, with all of us.

572
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,890
Okay, so what do you mean
that you've seen us all die?

573
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,590
Yeah, because I've gotta be honest, that's
a fucked up thing to just drop on somebody.

574
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,390
Every night since Derry...

575
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:38,360
Having these nightmares.

576
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:42,530
People in pain, people dying.

577
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,060
People...

578
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:46,990
So, you have nightmares. I have nightmares.
People have, they have nightmares

579
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:50,190
But that doesn't mean that
your visions are true.

580
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:55,290
I've watched every single
one of us this week

581
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,060
You've seen every single one of us, what?

582
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:05,860
To the place that Stanley wound up.

583
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,790
That's how we end.

584
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:13,430
How come the rest of us aren't seeing
that shit? What makes her so different?

585
00:52:14,190 --> 00:52:15,530
The dead lights -Dead lights

586
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:35,630
She was the only one of us that got
caught in the dead lights that day.

587
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:39,530
We were all touch by it, changed

588
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:43,630
Deep down, like an infection or a virus.

589
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,930
Virus, you understand? slowly...

590
00:52:48,030 --> 00:52:53,090
The virus, it's been growing for 27
years, this whole time, metastasizing.

591
00:52:53,190 --> 00:52:55,930
- It just got to Stan first...
- Because he was the weakest.

592
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,860
- Jesus Christ, Rich.
- I'm just saying what everyone else is thinking, man.

593
00:52:59,330 --> 00:53:00,390
I mean Rich, c'mon

594
00:53:00,930 --> 00:53:03,560
What Beverly sees, it will come to pass

595
00:53:03,790 --> 00:53:06,690
It'll happen to all of us
eventually, unless we stop it

596
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,360
How the hell are we supposed to do that?

597
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,890
The ritual of Chüd

598
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:13,730
The Shakopee

599
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,660
The first ones who fought it.
They have a saying:

600
00:53:17,230 --> 00:53:20,590
"All living things must abide by
the laws of the shape they inhabit."

601
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,260
A tribal ritual?

602
00:53:23,390 --> 00:53:25,230
Are you fucking kidding me, man?

603
00:53:25,430 --> 00:53:29,060
Alright, there's gotta be another way. This
thing comes back, what, every 27 years?

604
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:32,830
- Let's kick the can down the road and do it then.
- Then we'll be 70 years old, asshole.

605
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:34,160
It doesn't work that way.

606
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,430
None of us make it another 20 years and

607
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,430
the way it happens

608
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:45,630
So, if we don't beat IT this cycle then...

609
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:46,690
We die

610
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,930
Horribly

611
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,790
- Yeah I don't need the horribly part.
- I didn't' say it, She said it, not me.

612
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:56,160
Alright guys,
look I've seen what he's talking about

613
00:53:56,230 --> 00:54:01,230
And it's, it's all true. It's the only way.

614
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:06,490
- If we want this ritual to work...
- We have to remember.

615
00:54:07,590 --> 00:54:09,190
Remember what?

616
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,390
It's better if I show you...

617
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,360
We don't have much time.

618
00:54:22,190 --> 00:54:23,660
The cycle will end soon.

619
00:54:25,090 --> 00:54:27,860
- And once it does...
- We're fucked

620
00:54:51,260 --> 00:54:54,530
- The Barrens - This is where we came...

621
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:59,790
- After the rock fight.
- The Club House.

622
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:04,260
- Yes, yes, You built that for us.
- The hatch has got to be around here somewhere

623
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:05,890
I do remember that

624
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:09,860
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, you okay?

625
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:14,530
- What?
- Nothing.

626
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,330
It's just, you haven't changed,
it's a good thing. (laughing)

627
00:55:24,290 --> 00:55:26,890
You know what, I actually
think the door was more like...

628
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:30,090
around...

629
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:36,990
Found it.

630
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:40,190
I'm okay, come down!

631
00:55:57,490 --> 00:55:59,890
What the dick is this? How'd you build it?

632
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:05,130
- When did you build it?
- Here and there, I guess.

633
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:08,730
It was already dug up for some reason,
just had to reinforce the walls

634
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:12,360
And get some wood for the roof
door and that's pretty much it.

635
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:14,390
Pretty good for my first time, huh?

636
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:19,030
Now that's a cool feature.

637
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,390
What happens when you put your hand
on the other pillar, Professor?

638
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,360
You see this is exactly why there are
safety codes, why we have permits,

639
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:27,160
This place is a deathtrap,
you understand that?

640
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:30,530
- It's a work in progress, okay Eddie.
- Just so you know, if I get hurt you are liable.

641
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:33,890
- What is this? This switch from Iron Maiden?
- That's a flashlight.

642
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:36,640
What is that? A horse hitch?
When do you have horses down?

643
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:39,790
- This is cool.
- That was like three dollars, so be careful with that please.

644
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,730
I have one of these,
hey Stan, you see this?

645
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,990
Yeah, can you maybe not?
- What?

646
00:56:46,060 --> 00:56:49,160
Maybe not, yeah, maybe not what? Be awesome and have
fun and celebrate the magic of the paddle ball.

647
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,190
Wow, oh good going fucknut
you broke his thing.

648
00:56:53,260 --> 00:56:55,660
- I broke it?
- Yeah, you broke it with your face.

649
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:58,430
- What?
- I'm not putting my fucking hand down there.

650
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:09,990
(whispering) Oh my god!

651
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,630
Why do we all not remember this being here?

652
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:15,730
Hey, losers.

653
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:19,930
Time to float

654
00:57:25,790 --> 00:57:26,960
Fuck Richie.

655
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:29,430
- Dude!
- Remember he used to say that shit?

656
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:31,030
He'd do that little dance

657
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:37,790
- Am I the only one who remembers this shit?
- Are you going to be like this the entire time we're home?

658
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:41,960
Just trying to add some levity
to this shit, I'll go fuck myself

659
00:57:44,930 --> 00:57:46,960
Smells so fucking terrible in here.

660
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:51,130
Hey you guys

661
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:56,990
This, this, Stan

662
00:57:57,460 --> 00:58:00,130
For the use of Losers only

663
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:03,460
Bill

664
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,060
The fuck is this?

665
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:16,530
So you don't get spiders stuck in
your hair when you're down here

666
00:58:16,590 --> 00:58:18,530
Stanley, we are not
afraid of fucking spiders.

667
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,360
- I stand corrected.
- That's a first.

668
00:58:25,860 --> 00:58:29,060
- Touche.
- Hey Rich, your ten minutes are up.

669
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:32,190
- What are you talking about?
- The hammock, ten minutes each was the rule.

670
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,360
- I don't see any sign.
- Are you being this was right now, I mean really!

671
00:58:35,430 --> 00:58:37,290
Why would there be a sign,
if there was a verbal agreement?

672
00:58:37,360 --> 00:58:40,330
- I don't remember agreeing on anything.
- We agreed on the fucking rule!

673
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:44,160
- I can see your vagina.
- Ten minutes each.

674
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:49,260
- I fucked your mom.
- No you didn't.

675
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,760
- Take that back dickface.
- Fuck you!

676
00:58:51,830 --> 00:58:55,690
- You're awfully good at this new kid.
- Yoy really think so?

677
00:58:57,490 --> 00:58:59,690
There's actually a summer
program in Bar Harbor

678
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,960
Teaches you everything about architecture

679
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:03,830
- I was thinking about applying.
- I'll do that.

680
00:59:04,490 --> 00:59:06,390
I'll do anything to get
the hell out of Derry

681
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:10,630
- Man, when I graduate, I'm going to Florida.
- What's in Florida, Mike?

682
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:15,860
I don't know, I guess it's a
place I always wanted to go.

683
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:18,890
Stan, you should go with Mike to Florida.
You already act 80,

684
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,290
You'd clean up with all of the grandmas.

685
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,160
Do you guys think we will still be friends?

686
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:31,260
- When we are older?
- What?

687
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:33,860
Why wouldn't we be?

688
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,960
Do any of your parents still hang out
with their friends from middle school?

689
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:41,760
I mean, things might be different then.

690
00:59:43,190 --> 00:59:44,830
We all might be different.

691
00:59:46,630 --> 00:59:48,930
We'll always still be friends

692
00:59:49,830 --> 00:59:54,830
I don't think that just goes
away because we get older

693
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,860
Yeah Stan, come on.

694
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:01,560
You don't have to be so...

695
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:03,860
sad.

696
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:11,460
- He was old before his time.
- Yeah

697
01:00:12,890 --> 01:00:17,230
- Wonder what he was like all grown up?
- Probably what he was like as a kid.

698
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:21,990
The best.

699
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,920
Alright, Mike, what are we doing here?

700
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:33,430
The ritual, to perform
it, requires a sacrifice.

701
01:00:33,490 --> 01:00:35,290
Sacrifice, I nominate Eddie.

702
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,960
- Wait! What?
- Because you're little, you'll fit on a barbecue.

703
01:00:38,260 --> 01:00:40,200
I'm 5'9", that's like average
height for most of the world.

704
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,560
It's not that kind of a sacrifice, guys.

705
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:44,690
Mike

706
01:00:45,530 --> 01:00:46,790
The past is buried.

707
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:50,990
But you're gonna have to dig it up.
Piece by piece.

708
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:54,760
And these pieces, these artifacts...

709
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,290
That's why we are here.

710
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:04,560
They are what you will sacrifice.
And since Stan isn't here to find his,

711
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,090
I figure we should all be here
together to find his artifact.

712
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,660
I think Bill just did that.

713
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:19,990
Ok Mike, so where do we find our tokens?

714
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:21,760
I've gotta be honest, with all due respect

715
01:01:21,890 --> 01:01:25,230
This is fucking stupid, alright,
why do we need tokens, alright

716
01:01:25,290 --> 01:01:28,630
We already remember everything,
saving Bev, defeating IT, I mean

717
01:01:28,690 --> 01:01:31,490
- We're caught up.
- That's not everything.

718
01:01:33,290 --> 01:01:35,890
We fought, but what happened after that?

719
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,460
Before the house on Neibolt

720
01:01:39,630 --> 01:01:40,690
Think.

721
01:01:41,530 --> 01:01:45,730
We can't remember, can we?

722
01:01:45,990 --> 01:01:49,230
You see, there's more to our
story, what happened that summer.

723
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,460
And those blank spaces,
like pages torn out of a book...

724
01:01:54,330 --> 01:01:57,760
That's what you need to find.
We need to split up.

725
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,690
You each need to find your artifact, alone.

726
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:06,560
That's important. When you do,
meet me at the library tonight.

727
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:09,490
I gotta say statistically
speaking survival scenarios

728
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:12,090
we're gonna do much better as a group

729
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:14,290
Yes, splitting up would be dumb, man.

730
01:02:14,390 --> 01:02:17,660
We got to go together,
we were together that summer, right?

731
01:02:17,860 --> 01:02:18,890
No

732
01:02:20,530 --> 01:02:23,430
Not that whole summer.

733
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:25,460
Take it back!

734
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:27,360
Bill!

735
01:02:28,890 --> 01:02:30,490
You just a bunch of wusses.

736
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,460
- Fuck off!
- Stop!

737
01:02:35,730 --> 01:02:40,560
We were all together when we hurt
IT, that's why we are still alive

738
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,090
Yeah? Well I plan to keep it that way.

739
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:54,630
I bet by tomorrow,
we'll all be back together.

740
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,130
I don't think so.

741
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,260
Well if we want to stop IT we gotta be.

742
01:03:01,690 --> 01:03:04,760
Maybe Richie was right.

743
01:03:06,060 --> 01:03:11,390
- Maybe we shouldn't do anything about it, maybe we can't.
- Don't let them get to you.

744
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,690
It's a little late for that.

745
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,130
I should go.

746
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,930
Before your dad sees.

747
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,890
- Yes?
- Sorry.

748
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,760
<i>KERSH</i>

749
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,230
Can I help you?

750
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,490
- I thought I rang Marsh.
- Marsh?

751
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:14,260
- Alvin Marsh?
- My father, I grew up here.

752
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,960
Dear, it's not for me to tell you this,

753
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:28,790
But, your father passed away.

754
01:04:29,930 --> 01:04:33,090
I'm so sorry, you didn't know?

755
01:04:36,030 --> 01:04:38,330
We haven't spoken in a while

756
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:41,530
Well, won't you come in?

757
01:04:41,560 --> 01:04:46,230
- Let me offer you something to drink.
- No, it's fine. I have to go.

758
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:48,660
It's the least I can do.

759
01:04:51,360 --> 01:04:52,860
Sure. Okay.

760
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:08,960
- Is it like you remember?
- Cleaner.

761
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,830
Well you feel free to look around,
while I get the water boiling.

762
01:05:13,890 --> 01:05:17,160
- Really, it's fine, you don't need to do that.
- Don't be so polite!

763
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:48,760
Today is her birthday.

764
01:05:52,830 --> 01:05:55,090
I can still smell her perfume.

765
01:05:57,690 --> 01:06:00,590
And she would still be
alive, if it wasn't for you.

766
01:06:01,930 --> 01:06:03,530
Momma was sick.

767
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:07,230
You know that's why she did what she did.

768
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:13,390
She did what she did, because she
was embarrassed to be your mother!

769
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:17,090
You look like her.

770
01:06:19,630 --> 01:06:22,130
But you are nothing like her.

771
01:06:24,590 --> 01:06:25,930
Come here.

772
01:06:28,790 --> 01:06:30,430
I said come here!

773
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,330
Close your eyes.

774
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,660
You know that I would never hurt you.

775
01:06:53,890 --> 01:06:55,160
You know that, don't you?

776
01:07:04,690 --> 01:07:06,490
I'm sorry.

777
01:07:07,390 --> 01:07:10,390
You will always be my little
girl, won't you?

778
01:07:11,230 --> 01:07:12,330
Always.

779
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:27,960
Your hair is winter fire, January embers.

780
01:08:28,730 --> 01:08:31,260
<i>My heart burns there too.</i>

781
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,230
There. I do apologize.

782
01:08:51,390 --> 01:08:55,060
It gets so very hot here this time of year.

783
01:08:56,530 --> 01:09:00,960
- It's fine.
- You feel like you could just about die...

784
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:04,860
But you know what they say about Derry.

785
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:09,330
No one who dies here ever really dies.

786
01:09:21,830 --> 01:09:25,190
But tell me how is it being back in Derry?

787
01:09:27,660 --> 01:09:31,230
- It's kind of strange.
- Strange?

788
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:35,030
Oh my! Strange how?

789
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:43,560
I had some cookies in the oven
before you came. Stay right there.

790
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:48,360
- Uhm, I really, I shouldn't impose.
- No, no, no, I insist.

791
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,390
- Mrs. Kersh, are these your family?
- Yes dear.

792
01:09:57,490 --> 01:10:01,960
<i>My father came to this country with
fourteen dollars in his pocket.</i>

793
01:10:02,030 --> 01:10:06,960
<i>And he didn't ask for a handout, the
way the people come in here these days.</i>

794
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:10,230
- Do you know what he did?
- What did he do, Mrs. Kersh?

795
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:13,860
<i>My father joined the Circus.</i>

796
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,290
<i>I was always daddy's little girl.</i>

797
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:36,830
<i>What about you?</i>

798
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:43,690
<i>Are you still his little girl, Beverly?</i>

799
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:48,790
<i>Are you?</i>

800
01:11:01,160 --> 01:11:03,790
Don't fool your father!

801
01:11:09,230 --> 01:11:10,990
What? Help!

802
01:11:12,030 --> 01:11:16,090
Run, run, run...

803
01:11:18,990 --> 01:11:22,960
You haven't changed anything yet

804
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,590
You haven't changed your futures.

805
01:11:32,290 --> 01:11:37,230
You, you haven't saved any of them.

806
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:45,730
- Close your eyes, Bev.
- Fuck you!

807
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,990
If you don't believe...

808
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,290
Close them.

809
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,830
And see

810
01:11:56,590 --> 01:11:57,590
Yeah

811
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:56,760
Come on.

812
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:01,090
- Ken, you little bitch.
- Yes!

813
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,990
- You're fucking good.
- Game Over.

814
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,690
- Well I gotta go.
- Hey uhm...

815
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:16,690
How about we go again?
Play some more you know?

816
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,830
Only if you want to.

817
01:13:22,230 --> 01:13:25,990
- Shut up.
- Dude, why are you being weird?

818
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:28,230
I'm not your fucking boyfriend.

819
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:31,260
- Whoa, I didn't mean...
- The fucks going on here?

820
01:13:32,060 --> 01:13:33,570
You assholes didn't tell me your town

821
01:13:33,590 --> 01:13:34,970
is full of little fairies.

822
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:37,530
Richie Fucking Tozier, wait?

823
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:39,960
You trying to bone my little cousin?

824
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,390
Get the fuck outta here, Faggot!

825
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:48,960
Fucking move!

826
01:14:11,860 --> 01:14:13,590
(Distorted) Want a kiss, Ritchie?

827
01:14:45,360 --> 01:14:51,860
It's not real. (repeating, faster)

828
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,730
I think I just shit my pants.

829
01:15:17,030 --> 01:15:19,930
Marine Festival closing
performance is tonight.

830
01:15:20,590 --> 01:15:22,230
Hope to see you there, handsome.

831
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:31,790
- Did you miss me, Richie?
- Fuck!

832
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:38,390
Cause I missed you.

833
01:15:39,190 --> 01:15:43,190
No one wants to play
with the clown anymore.

834
01:15:43,930 --> 01:15:45,790
Play a game with me, would ya?

835
01:15:46,590 --> 01:15:50,360
How about Street Fighter?
Oh yes, you like that one, don't you?

836
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:57,930
- Or maybe Truth or Dare.
- Jesus.

837
01:15:58,730 --> 01:16:04,060
Oh you wouldn't want anyone to pick
truth though would ya, huh Ritchie?

838
01:16:04,130 --> 01:16:08,560
You wouldn't want anyone
to know what you're hiding.

839
01:16:11,390 --> 01:16:14,530
<i>I know your secret</i>

840
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:18,030
<i>Your dirty little secret...</i>

841
01:16:18,230 --> 01:16:20,860
<i>I know your secret</i>

842
01:16:21,160 --> 01:16:24,460
<i>Your dirty little secret!</i>

843
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:28,760
- Should I tell them, Richie?
- this is not real.

844
01:16:30,530 --> 01:16:33,130
This is not real,
this really isn't happening, it isn't real

845
01:16:38,230 --> 01:16:40,290
Come back and play

846
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:44,960
Come back and play with the clown!

847
01:16:51,160 --> 01:16:53,690
I'm so, so sorry, sorry.

848
01:16:56,490 --> 01:16:57,560
Sorry.

849
01:17:24,230 --> 01:17:26,490
- Oh man.
- Can I help you?

850
01:17:27,590 --> 01:17:30,160
Yeah, I wanna see about the...

851
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,590
Baseball card?

852
01:17:34,130 --> 01:17:35,730
Bowling ball?

853
01:17:36,730 --> 01:17:37,890
The banjo?

854
01:17:38,930 --> 01:17:41,790
- Beaver?
- The fucking bike.

855
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,830
If you wanna use that kind of language

856
01:17:46,860 --> 01:17:49,730
- Take it out in the street.
- Sorry.

857
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:53,190
Can we start over and pretend
that I just walked in?

858
01:17:54,060 --> 01:17:55,390
How can I help you?

859
01:17:55,460 --> 01:17:57,960
Thank you, yes, I wanna buy the bike.

860
01:17:58,230 --> 01:18:02,860
- Aren't you William Denbrough, the writer?
- Yes that's me.

861
01:18:03,630 --> 01:18:06,090
That bike? It used to be mine.

862
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:08,860
Well. It's mine now.

863
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:12,790
But you're the big author,
so if you want it, you can afford it.

864
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,530
Alright, how much?

865
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:24,130
$ 300, you can afford it.

866
01:18:24,860 --> 01:18:28,890
- I'll get it.
- I guess that's kind of a deal.

867
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:43,690
- You, uh, you want me to sign this for you?
- Nah, I didn't like the ending.

868
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:52,260
- Three big ones.
- All yours.

869
01:18:53,030 --> 01:18:57,690
I don't know how fast you'll go.
Been there a lot of years.

870
01:18:59,290 --> 01:19:04,090
You know what mister,
she's fast enough to beat the Devil.

871
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:12,730
Come on!

872
01:19:20,490 --> 01:19:22,490
Yeah, I missed you too.

873
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:30,030
Yeah!

874
01:19:40,690 --> 01:19:45,860
Hi Ho Silver, Away!!!

875
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:10,060
<i>Hi, Billy.</i>

876
01:20:42,030 --> 01:20:45,990
I know you are down there,
I know you can here me.

877
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:49,830
There's something I have to know...

878
01:20:51,190 --> 01:20:56,160
Of all the kids in this town you
could have taken, why Georgie?

879
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:03,590
Say something!

880
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:09,460
Why him? Why him? WHY HIM?

881
01:21:29,330 --> 01:21:30,660
<i>Why?</i>

882
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:39,930
<i>Because you weren't there, Billy.</i>

883
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,490
<i>Billy, don't leave.</i>

884
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,560
Hello?

885
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:03,660
<i>Billy.</i>

886
01:22:07,690 --> 01:22:09,330
<i>I'm still here.</i>

887
01:22:11,990 --> 01:22:13,290
<i>Help me.</i>

888
01:22:15,130 --> 01:22:16,360
Georgie!

889
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:23,190
Georgie?

890
01:22:24,030 --> 01:22:25,890
<i>Help me, Billy.</i>

891
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:27,760
Take my hand.

892
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:32,330
- Take my hand, I got you buddy.
- He's coming.

893
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,790
- Take my hand.
- Billy, please, he's coming.

894
01:22:36,860 --> 01:22:39,690
- Take my hand. Come on, take my hand.
- Billy!

895
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:03,430
I hate you!

896
01:23:04,590 --> 01:23:06,090
I hate you...

897
01:23:07,030 --> 01:23:08,460
Who are you talking to?

898
01:23:10,090 --> 01:23:13,090
Move, m-m-m-m-move!

899
01:23:13,890 --> 01:23:16,290
You hear voices from that sewer.
You stay away from it.

900
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:21,130
- Do you hear voices from the sewer?
- No.

901
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:24,430
No. Just stay away from that sewer.

902
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:29,260
I only hear voices in the tub.

903
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:33,060
You know, from the drain.

904
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:38,430
- What kind of voices?
- Kids.

905
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:43,390
- And other times like a...
- Clown?

906
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,960
You listen to me, you listen good.
You need to get out of this town.

907
01:23:53,060 --> 01:23:56,630
Alright, tell you parents, make up a reason,
you make up a fucking lie, I don't care

908
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:59,530
I don't care what you do, get out of this town,
make them never bring you back, you understand?

909
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:02,860
You leave Derry and you stay out of
Derry, do you understand me?

910
01:24:03,260 --> 01:24:06,430
- I'm supposed to be at the Festival.
- Tell me you understand!

911
01:24:12,130 --> 01:24:15,790
I'm supposed to be at the
festival, I gotta go.

912
01:24:17,590 --> 01:24:20,260
Just be careful.

913
01:25:03,260 --> 01:25:04,660
Let's get the fuck outta here.

914
01:25:05,660 --> 01:25:07,730
Wake up fat-ass.

915
01:25:10,360 --> 01:25:12,130
Fucking loser.

916
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:38,460
Whoa, easy. It's just me.

917
01:25:39,690 --> 01:25:41,990
What are you and your little
buddies up to in here?

918
01:25:43,260 --> 01:25:47,460
- Oh, those guys are definitely not my buddies.
- I meant your real friends.

919
01:25:47,530 --> 01:25:49,560
Joey, Jonathan, Donny and Danny.

920
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:58,630
- Are you smoking in school?
- Secret hide out.

921
01:26:00,360 --> 01:26:01,890
Don't tell anyone.

922
01:26:09,460 --> 01:26:12,590
- You okay, new kid?
- Yeah, no I'm fine.

923
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:17,630
I guess I'm just worried that...

924
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:21,530
We're not all gonna be the
same, after the fight.

925
01:26:22,790 --> 01:26:25,390
As long as we can still hang
out, who cares?

926
01:26:26,960 --> 01:26:28,290
You really mean that?

927
01:26:31,030 --> 01:26:32,990
Well yeah of course, dummy.

928
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:39,630
You and me.

929
01:26:45,230 --> 01:26:47,190
Oh my god!

930
01:26:48,430 --> 01:26:50,190
I meant as a friend.

931
01:26:51,660 --> 01:26:57,190
You actually thought I could like someone
as fat, and gross, and disgusting like you?

932
01:26:58,890 --> 01:27:02,360
No matter how many stupid
(voice changes) poems you write

933
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:11,330
Your hair is winter fire,

934
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,160
January embers

935
01:27:22,430 --> 01:27:24,990
My heart burns there too.

936
01:27:50,060 --> 01:27:54,530
That's not the real Beverly.
Beverly would never say things like that.

937
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:56,260
She'd never say that.

938
01:28:12,190 --> 01:28:13,890
Kiss me, fat boy.

939
01:28:23,930 --> 01:28:29,230
Ohhhhh, nobody wants to kiss the fat boy...

940
01:28:29,290 --> 01:28:32,690
- Leave me alone.
- Oh no?

941
01:28:32,760 --> 01:28:36,690
You'll always be alone.

942
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,360
That is not true. I have real friends.

943
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:42,030
Bill, Eddie, Mike, Stanley,
Richie and Beverly.

944
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,410
They are my real friends!

945
01:28:43,930 --> 01:28:47,860
Kiss me, as if it were the last time.

946
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:57,060
What the hell you doing, kid?

947
01:29:13,190 --> 01:29:16,530
- Guys?
- Hey

948
01:29:18,490 --> 01:29:19,890
Hey

949
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:25,460
- So, what did you see out there?
- Something I wish I hadn't.

950
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:30,760
So what... we just...

951
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:37,590
We kill IT and then we just
forget everything again?

952
01:29:37,660 --> 01:29:41,490
- I hope so, don't you?
- I don't know.

953
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:45,530
I guess I want to hold on
to the good stuff, you know?

954
01:29:46,630 --> 01:29:50,160
I mean come on there must be something
you don't want to forget again.

955
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:56,630
- I remember being scared shitless.
- Cold...

956
01:29:57,860 --> 01:30:03,830
- I remember you guys in your tightie-whiteys.
- Oh, okay, please forget that moment.

957
01:30:04,930 --> 01:30:06,960
I remember this.

958
01:30:09,630 --> 01:30:12,130
I remember the boy who wrote it for me.

959
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:16,660
Not him so much, but...

960
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:20,530
How he made me feel.

961
01:30:21,690 --> 01:30:25,490
And a kiss

962
01:30:28,730 --> 01:30:32,090
I don't know, it's still blurry.

963
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:36,560
But I think the longer we're
here; the more I can see it.

964
01:30:36,630 --> 01:30:40,690
The more I can see that
moment, the more I can see...

965
01:30:41,690 --> 01:30:42,890
Bill

966
01:30:45,230 --> 01:30:46,630
I think.

967
01:30:48,860 --> 01:30:51,430
I don't know, do you remember?

968
01:30:54,130 --> 01:30:55,460
Bev...

969
01:30:57,130 --> 01:30:58,990
- Move, move.
- What's wrong?

970
01:30:59,390 --> 01:31:00,390
I'm leaving.

971
01:31:01,230 --> 01:31:04,030
What? You can't leave man, we split.
we all die.

972
01:31:04,130 --> 01:31:04,960
Yeah, I'll take my chances,

973
01:31:04,990 --> 01:31:08,030
- We're all gonna die anyway.
- Rich!

974
01:31:11,390 --> 01:31:12,790
Rich!

975
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:17,430
The Beaver wishes you good morning.

976
01:31:17,460 --> 01:31:22,460
Today is the last day
of the Marine Festival.

977
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:26,460
Ow, asshole!

978
01:31:40,490 --> 01:31:41,760
Hello?

979
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:58,530
- Can I help you?
- I called in, I had a prescription called in for Kaspbrak.

980
01:31:58,590 --> 01:32:01,360
- Kaspbrak.
- It's an Inhaler.

981
01:32:03,590 --> 01:32:06,830
- Eddie Kaspbrak?
- That's me.

982
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,530
- I remember you.
- Yeah.

983
01:32:11,890 --> 01:32:15,190
- How is your mom?
- She died a few years ago.

984
01:32:15,260 --> 01:32:17,730
- It was very sad, it was from liver cancer.
- What's that?

985
01:32:17,790 --> 01:32:20,030
- What's what?
- That.

986
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,660
Alright. Okay.

987
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:28,990
- It's not gonna pop, it's a mole.
- It might not be cancer.

988
01:32:29,030 --> 01:32:30,160
Cancer?

989
01:32:32,190 --> 01:32:33,760
But it might be.

990
01:32:34,230 --> 01:32:37,930
You just stay here, I'll get you something.

991
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:40,930
Okay.

992
01:32:50,390 --> 01:32:52,860
You came here for your stinky breath pills?

993
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:56,090
My, my breath is fine, thank you.

994
01:32:58,160 --> 01:32:59,890
That's not what my dad said.

995
01:33:00,790 --> 01:33:03,160
He said you have a tumor.

996
01:33:05,490 --> 01:33:06,930
On your dick.

997
01:33:07,960 --> 01:33:10,060
You don't take pill for...

998
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,860
- Wait, what did your dad say?
- Here you go.

999
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:19,090
Hope your dick feels better.

1000
01:33:20,590 --> 01:33:21,930
Thank you.

1001
01:33:23,460 --> 01:33:26,990
For the inhaler, not the penis, thing.

1002
01:33:27,030 --> 01:33:29,390
<i>Eddie!</i>

1003
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:33,830
<i>Eddie Bear!</i>

1004
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:38,960
Mommy?

1005
01:33:44,830 --> 01:33:47,060
<i>Eddie Bear!</i>

1006
01:33:49,730 --> 01:33:51,160
Mommy?

1007
01:33:54,230 --> 01:33:56,490
<i>Eddie, come help me, please.,</i>

1008
01:34:13,160 --> 01:34:16,160
- Eddie!
- Mommy?

1009
01:34:16,390 --> 01:34:20,760
Eddie, help me, Eddie, quick help me.

1010
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:25,060
- Mommy?
- Eddie bear, come help me.

1011
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:45,760
- Eddie?
- What is he doing here?

1012
01:34:45,830 --> 01:34:49,290
- What is taking you so long?
- What are you doing here?

1013
01:34:58,730 --> 01:34:59,730
Mommy.

1014
01:35:00,660 --> 01:35:02,460
He's coming,
you have got to get me out of here.

1015
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,130
- Who's coming?
- Eddie.

1016
01:35:05,560 --> 01:35:07,130
What the fuck is that?

1017
01:35:14,460 --> 01:35:19,030
- Mommy.
- Eddie, get me out of here. He's gonna kill me.

1018
01:35:19,130 --> 01:35:20,260
Eddie

1019
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:22,090
Please help!

1020
01:35:23,730 --> 01:35:26,190
Eddie, he's gonna infect me, Eddie.

1021
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,330
Help me.

1022
01:35:30,030 --> 01:35:32,260
Help me! It's coming, Eddie.

1023
01:35:32,830 --> 01:35:34,360
Eddie

1024
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:36,630
He's gonna infect me, Eddie.

1025
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:40,790
Oh my God!

1026
01:35:41,890 --> 01:35:43,190
Faster!

1027
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:50,760
Eddie!

1028
01:35:58,090 --> 01:35:59,190
I can't do it.

1029
01:35:59,930 --> 01:36:02,660
I'm sorry, I can't do it, mom.

1030
01:36:02,730 --> 01:36:06,030
I knew you would leave me, Eddie

1031
01:36:08,030 --> 01:36:09,790
Help me!

1032
01:36:14,760 --> 01:36:16,690
<i>Eddie!</i>

1033
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:25,260
What the hell was she doing here?
Why is that curtain still here?

1034
01:36:25,530 --> 01:36:28,690
Alright, Okay, We're gonna do this Eds.

1035
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,290
It's just a memory, just a memory.
You'll be fine. Take a breath.

1036
01:36:33,530 --> 01:36:34,860
Deep breath.

1037
01:36:35,360 --> 01:36:37,660
Okay, you can do it.

1038
01:36:46,890 --> 01:36:49,960
No, shit!

1039
01:36:51,090 --> 01:36:52,260
No Stop! Fuck!

1040
01:37:17,330 --> 01:37:18,560
Take that!

1041
01:37:19,530 --> 01:37:24,460
Fuck you!

1042
01:37:36,930 --> 01:37:38,530
What the fuck?

1043
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:43,230
Let me out.

1044
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:46,790
- What?
- Push, don't pull them, moron.

1045
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:48,730
Thanks

1046
01:38:02,930 --> 01:38:06,390
- Oh my God, what happened to you?
- Nothing, I'm fine.

1047
01:38:06,590 --> 01:38:08,190
I'm fine, everything is fine.

1048
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:12,570
- Hey, how you doing? Where's everybody else?
- Richie wants to leave.

1049
01:38:12,590 --> 01:38:16,430
- Ben's upstairs trying to get him to stay.
- I know, he's just scared.

1050
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:18,790
So am I, Bill. Aren't you?

1051
01:38:19,130 --> 01:38:22,260
We are all scared, that's what worries me.

1052
01:38:22,330 --> 01:38:23,760
Because that's what it wants.

1053
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,760
We can do this,
but we have to stick together.

1054
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:28,430
- Should we be running?
- This is Derry, I'm kinda getting used to it.

1055
01:39:53,390 --> 01:39:56,390
<i>You won't be there for him either.</i>

1056
01:39:57,430 --> 01:39:58,660
What does that mean?

1057
01:39:59,730 --> 01:40:02,830
- Shit, it's the kid.
- What?

1058
01:40:02,890 --> 01:40:06,830
It's the kid, from the
place, the Chinese place.

1059
01:40:06,860 --> 01:40:09,660
I saw him on the way here.
He lives in my old house.

1060
01:40:09,790 --> 01:40:12,130
He said he was going to the fair.

1061
01:40:15,630 --> 01:40:17,000
He's going to the fair,
I've gotta help him.

1062
01:40:17,030 --> 01:40:20,730
Okay, okay, listen to me, we'll go
together. I'm gonna get Richie and Ben

1063
01:40:20,790 --> 01:40:22,040
- And we'll go.
- There's no time.

1064
01:40:22,060 --> 01:40:25,060
- I can't let it happen again.
- What happened before, it wasn't your fault.

1065
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:27,990
- None of it was.
- I wish that were true, Bev.

1066
01:40:30,460 --> 01:40:32,060
Bill! Bev!

1067
01:40:33,030 --> 01:40:36,430
What is this? What happened?
Did Bill just leave?

1068
01:40:36,790 --> 01:40:38,990
I couldn't stop him, everyone's leaving.

1069
01:40:39,060 --> 01:40:41,890
It's alright, it's Bill, he'll come back.

1070
01:40:42,330 --> 01:40:44,760
At least I got Richie to stay.

1071
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:48,330
Fuck!

1072
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:07,560
And then the leper,
he threw up all over me.

1073
01:41:07,830 --> 01:41:09,790
Eds, Mike Hanlon,
why don't you come back to Maine?

1074
01:41:12,890 --> 01:41:14,730
It's your time, Eddie.

1075
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:17,730
What?

1076
01:41:19,930 --> 01:41:22,890
Why did you do this?

1077
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:26,860
- Because he says it's your time.
- Who said it's my time?

1078
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:33,160
You know, Eddie. You know

1079
01:41:33,490 --> 01:41:35,260
It is time to float.

1080
01:41:41,530 --> 01:41:43,090
Where did you go?

1081
01:41:46,130 --> 01:41:49,230
Now give me back my fucking knife!

1082
01:42:06,490 --> 01:42:09,730
You need to cut that fucking mullet,
it's been like fucking 30 years, man.

1083
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:11,490
Guys!

1084
01:42:12,860 --> 01:42:14,330
Shit.

1085
01:42:15,660 --> 01:42:16,790
Eds?

1086
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:20,330
Jesus, Ed! What the hell?

1087
01:42:21,290 --> 01:42:23,260
Bowers is in my room.

1088
01:42:25,260 --> 01:42:26,590
Is it bad?

1089
01:42:41,890 --> 01:42:45,090
I'm gonna carve my whole name
onto this cottage cheese.

1090
01:42:46,630 --> 01:42:47,830
Stop!

1091
01:42:51,760 --> 01:42:56,130
One dead. Fuck yeah!!!

1092
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,390
Hey!!!

1093
01:43:24,530 --> 01:43:27,030
Hey Kid! Kid!

1094
01:43:28,860 --> 01:43:30,590
Sorry. Hey!

1095
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:33,290
Excuse me, hey, hey!

1096
01:43:38,530 --> 01:43:39,530
Fuck!

1097
01:43:49,630 --> 01:43:50,630
Fuck!

1098
01:44:08,030 --> 01:44:09,790
Kid, hey, kid...

1099
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:13,360
Kid...

1100
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:18,630
Fuck!

1101
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:25,660
Fuck...

1102
01:44:30,290 --> 01:44:32,890
Kid? Hey!

1103
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:43,190
Kid.

1104
01:44:48,960 --> 01:44:51,190
Kid! Hey hey!

1105
01:44:51,430 --> 01:44:52,460
Hey...

1106
01:44:53,290 --> 01:44:54,530
Awww fuck...

1107
01:44:55,460 --> 01:44:56,860
Shit.

1108
01:44:57,460 --> 01:44:59,930
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

1109
01:45:01,560 --> 01:45:05,760
- I'm here to help.
- Stop following me!

1110
01:45:05,830 --> 01:45:08,230
I'm gonna get,
I'm gonna get you outta here.

1111
01:45:14,760 --> 01:45:15,930
No

1112
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:19,890
Please!

1113
01:45:25,230 --> 01:45:27,630
I'm here now, just take me.

1114
01:45:32,230 --> 01:45:34,430
No, son of a bitch!

1115
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:37,790
Motherfucker!

1116
01:45:45,660 --> 01:45:46,760
Help!

1117
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,390
NO!

1118
01:46:20,830 --> 01:46:22,390
I should go back there.

1119
01:46:22,460 --> 01:46:24,360
I just lucking left them in a lurch.
I should go back there.

1120
01:46:24,390 --> 01:46:27,430
What the fuck are you doing?
No fuck that, fuck them.

1121
01:46:28,690 --> 01:46:31,460
I've got date in fucking Reno, man.

1122
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,090
<i>Amen.</i>

1123
01:46:40,690 --> 01:46:43,760
Reflecting on the meaning
of what I just read,

1124
01:46:43,860 --> 01:46:45,690
the word "meshane" comes up a lot,

1125
01:46:45,730 --> 01:46:49,290
which means " to change /to transform".

1126
01:46:50,060 --> 01:46:54,730
Which makes sense I guess because,
today I am supposed to become a man

1127
01:46:58,160 --> 01:46:59,490
<i>It's funny though</i>

1128
01:47:00,660 --> 01:47:04,030
<i>Everyone, I think, has some memories...</i>

1129
01:47:04,090 --> 01:47:06,090
<i>They're prouder of than others, right?</i>

1130
01:47:07,290 --> 01:47:11,060
<i>And maybe that's why
the change is so scary.</i>

1131
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,730
<i>Cause the things we wish
we could leave behind.</i>

1132
01:47:16,990 --> 01:47:18,890
- Good morning, Mike.
- How are you doing?

1133
01:47:19,590 --> 01:47:21,830
<i>The whispers we wish we could silence...</i>

1134
01:47:21,890 --> 01:47:25,090
It's possibly,
he's the one that set that fire.

1135
01:47:27,330 --> 01:47:29,930
<i>The nightmares we most
want to wake up from.</i>

1136
01:47:32,790 --> 01:47:35,260
<i>The memories we wish we could change</i>

1137
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:42,990
<i>Secrets, we feel like we have to keep...</i>

1138
01:47:45,190 --> 01:47:47,690
<i>Are the hardest to walk away from...</i>

1139
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,560
<i>The good stuff...</i>

1140
01:47:54,490 --> 01:47:57,530
<i>The pictures in our mind
that fade away the fastest...</i>

1141
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:02,290
<i>Those pieces of you that
feels the easiest to loose...</i>

1142
01:48:04,130 --> 01:48:06,790
<i>Maybe I don't want to forget...</i>

1143
01:48:09,130 --> 01:48:12,790
Maybe... If that's what
today is all about...

1144
01:48:14,490 --> 01:48:17,760
- Forget it, right?
- Thank you, Stanley.

1145
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:23,030
Today, I'm supposed to become a
man, but I don't feel any different

1146
01:48:25,030 --> 01:48:28,530
I know I'm a loser. And no matter what...

1147
01:48:29,460 --> 01:48:31,860
I always fucking will be.

1148
01:48:51,660 --> 01:48:53,860
Thanks for showing up, Stanley.

1149
01:49:39,290 --> 01:49:43,690
Help! Mike, please help us!

1150
01:49:44,660 --> 01:49:47,460
- Mikey, please.
- Call for help.

1151
01:49:47,560 --> 01:49:49,760
Mikey, help us!

1152
01:50:13,630 --> 01:50:16,460
You should have burned, Mike.

1153
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:24,990
Just like your druggie parents.

1154
01:50:25,390 --> 01:50:27,630
Can you see them yet?

1155
01:50:27,990 --> 01:50:32,690
Crispy... like fried fucking chicken

1156
01:50:44,330 --> 01:50:49,290
Guess you could say that was long overdue.
You get it? Because we are in a library.

1157
01:50:55,530 --> 01:50:56,660
Mike!

1158
01:51:00,990 --> 01:51:02,130
Oh my god!

1159
01:51:04,890 --> 01:51:08,590
- You're alriight?
- No, I'm not alright, I just fucking killed a guy.

1160
01:51:09,660 --> 01:51:11,290
I was talking to Mike.

1161
01:51:13,360 --> 01:51:14,530
Where's Bill?

1162
01:51:20,990 --> 01:51:23,330
Bill, we're at the library, where you at?

1163
01:51:23,390 --> 01:51:28,730
It's the little kid, he killed the
little kid right in fucking front of me.

1164
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:34,060
No, no, no, no, look, just come here to
the library. We can help with a plan.

1165
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:36,360
- I'm going to kill it.
- No, no, no, no

1166
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:40,730
- I don't want any of you to get killed with me.
- Bill!

1167
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:48,490
- He's gonna fight it alone.
- What?

1168
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:49,560
Alone.

1169
01:51:50,230 --> 01:51:55,390
It's about the group, the ritual doesn't work without
the group. Doing it together is why it worked.

1170
01:51:58,590 --> 01:52:00,830
Mike, did he tell you where he was going?

1171
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:04,930
If he really wanted to kill Pennywise,
there's only one place he'll go.

1172
01:52:04,960 --> 01:52:07,090
The same place the ritual
needs to be performed.

1173
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,030
Oh, we're not gonna like this, are we?

1174
01:52:10,790 --> 01:52:11,790
Fuck!

1175
01:52:41,030 --> 01:52:43,590
- Bill!
- No.

1176
01:52:43,630 --> 01:52:44,790
No, no you guys, no

1177
01:52:45,330 --> 01:52:49,890
I started all this.
It is my fault that you are all here.

1178
01:52:50,160 --> 01:52:53,860
This curse, this fucking
thing that's inside of you all

1179
01:52:53,930 --> 01:52:57,290
It started growing the day that I
made you all go down in the barrens

1180
01:52:57,360 --> 01:53:02,290
Because all I cared about
was finding Georgie.

1181
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:07,990
Now, I'm gonna go in there and
I don't know what's gonna happen

1182
01:53:08,430 --> 01:53:09,630
But I can't ask you to do this.

1183
01:53:12,890 --> 01:53:16,930
- We're not asking you either.
- We didn't do it alone then, Bill.

1184
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:22,230
- So we're not gonna do this alone now.
- Losers stick together.

1185
01:53:27,830 --> 01:53:30,930
So does somebody wanna say something?

1186
01:53:32,660 --> 01:53:36,930
- Richie said it best, when we where here last.
- I did?

1187
01:53:39,060 --> 01:53:40,930
- I don't want to die?
- Not that.

1188
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:44,370
You're lucky we're not measuring dicks?

1189
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:46,090
No

1190
01:53:48,490 --> 01:53:51,130
- Let's kill this fucking clown?
- Yeah.

1191
01:53:54,030 --> 01:53:56,260
Let's kill this fucking clown!

1192
01:54:23,060 --> 01:54:26,690
- Well, I love what he's done with the place.
- Beep, beep, Richie.

1193
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,560
Hey, hey, hey, that's the basement, right?

1194
01:54:54,330 --> 01:54:55,790
Ben!

1195
01:54:56,590 --> 01:54:58,890
- Damn it, no!
- Ben!

1196
01:54:58,930 --> 01:55:00,060
Ben!

1197
01:55:00,160 --> 01:55:01,760
Ben, what's wrong?

1198
01:55:03,430 --> 01:55:04,860
Ben!

1199
01:55:05,330 --> 01:55:06,690
Ben!

1200
01:55:13,730 --> 01:55:15,690
That can't be good, right?

1201
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:18,390
Help! Hey!

1202
01:55:33,490 --> 01:55:34,760
It's Stan.

1203
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:39,530
It can't be real.

1204
01:55:45,590 --> 01:55:47,190
Jesus Christ!

1205
01:55:55,460 --> 01:55:58,060
I'd still be alive,
if it wasn't for you, Bill.

1206
01:55:58,860 --> 01:55:59,930
No

1207
01:56:04,460 --> 01:56:05,790
Beverly!

1208
01:56:27,490 --> 01:56:29,860
Richie, what's happening to me?

1209
01:56:49,660 --> 01:56:52,460
You gotta be fucking kidding.

1210
01:56:58,590 --> 01:57:00,460
Shit!

1211
01:57:02,130 --> 01:57:04,790
Get off of me!

1212
01:57:20,230 --> 01:57:24,060
Eddie, are you okay?

1213
01:57:30,560 --> 01:57:32,060
Aw, there he is.

1214
01:57:35,090 --> 01:57:36,690
Get it off.

1215
01:57:38,030 --> 01:57:40,030
Get it off me!

1216
01:57:40,830 --> 01:57:43,490
Richie!

1217
01:57:43,530 --> 01:57:44,530
Guys!

1218
01:57:47,830 --> 01:57:49,260
I wanna to go home

1219
01:57:50,190 --> 01:57:52,090
Get the knife!

1220
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:55,760
- God damn it, Eddie, get the knife!
- Take it off, please!

1221
01:57:58,430 --> 01:57:59,830
Eddie, get the knife!

1222
01:58:23,430 --> 01:58:24,560
What?

1223
01:58:35,830 --> 01:58:37,460
Is everyone okay?

1224
01:58:38,830 --> 01:58:39,830
You alright?

1225
01:58:41,230 --> 01:58:44,860
You could have fucking died, man.
You know that?

1226
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:49,430
Georgie is dead,
the kid's dead and Stanley's dead.

1227
01:58:49,490 --> 01:58:51,560
You want Richie too?

1228
01:58:51,590 --> 01:58:54,830
- Do you want Richie too?
- (repeating) I don't

1229
01:58:59,360 --> 01:59:01,290
Please don't be mad, Bill.

1230
01:59:05,360 --> 01:59:06,990
I was just scared

1231
01:59:08,490 --> 01:59:12,530
That, that's what he wants.

1232
01:59:14,990 --> 01:59:17,290
So, don't give it to him.

1233
01:59:29,730 --> 01:59:31,560
A lot of memories, huh?

1234
01:59:33,930 --> 01:59:35,560
All bad.

1235
01:59:47,730 --> 01:59:49,290
Oh man!

1236
01:59:50,530 --> 01:59:51,930
Gray water.

1237
02:00:30,490 --> 02:00:32,490
Shit, this is it.

1238
02:00:33,760 --> 02:00:35,560
This is were it happened.

1239
02:00:51,090 --> 02:00:54,260
No, no, no, no, no...

1240
02:01:02,930 --> 02:01:04,490
Bevvie

1241
02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,160
Bev, what is it?

1242
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:21,660
I thought I heard something.

1243
02:01:23,860 --> 02:01:27,560
- Bev!
- Time to sink.

1244
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:31,760
Bev!

1245
02:01:34,590 --> 02:01:36,030
Guys?

1246
02:01:38,460 --> 02:01:40,060
Ok guys, come on.

1247
02:01:44,660 --> 02:01:48,630
Hey guys? Guys come on, please...

1248
02:01:48,660 --> 02:01:50,790
(crying) I don't want to
walk out of here alone.

1249
02:01:53,590 --> 02:01:55,290
- Thank you.
- You okay?

1250
02:01:56,230 --> 02:02:00,990
- I feel like crying.
- Mike, where do we go from here?

1251
02:02:08,130 --> 02:02:14,730
From the depths, is where it crashed.
Beneath we find relief. (repeats)

1252
02:02:14,790 --> 02:02:18,060
- Is he okay?
- I think at this point, that's a relevant question.

1253
02:02:18,090 --> 02:02:22,830
- What's on the other side?
- I don't know, no one does.

1254
02:02:26,690 --> 02:02:27,990
Mike!

1255
02:02:34,160 --> 02:02:37,830
- Alright, see you there.
- Mike!

1256
02:02:43,490 --> 02:02:46,630
- Stay together.
- Okay.

1257
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:51,360
You guys I can't do it.

1258
02:02:52,960 --> 02:02:57,430
I can't, you saw what happened up there.
I was gonna let you die.

1259
02:02:57,490 --> 02:03:02,890
I just fucking froze up. You let me go down
there with you, I'm gonna get us all killed.

1260
02:03:02,960 --> 02:03:05,890
- Give me that, give me that, give
me, Richie, let go, you little turd.

1261
02:03:06,830 --> 02:03:08,290
Just let me...

1262
02:03:10,130 --> 02:03:12,930
- I got it.
- Stop. Listen to me...

1263
02:03:13,430 --> 02:03:17,930
You had a moment, fine, but who killed a
psychotic clown before he was fourteen?

1264
02:03:19,660 --> 02:03:20,660
Me.

1265
02:03:20,730 --> 02:03:23,270
Who stabbed Bowers with a knife
that he pulled out of his own face?

1266
02:03:23,290 --> 02:03:24,230
Also me.

1267
02:03:24,260 --> 02:03:26,700
Who married a woman ten
times his own body mass?

1268
02:03:28,790 --> 02:03:30,190
- Me.
- Yeah.

1269
02:03:33,530 --> 02:03:37,490
- You're braver than you think.
- I don't think so, Richie.

1270
02:03:38,690 --> 02:03:39,890
- Ow.
- Sorry

1271
02:03:42,730 --> 02:03:46,630
Here, take it. It kills monsters.

1272
02:03:48,760 --> 02:03:52,690
- Does it?
- Yeah, if you believe it does.

1273
02:03:54,230 --> 02:03:55,660
Thanks, Bev.

1274
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:15,830
- You guys good?
- Yeah.

1275
02:04:20,660 --> 02:04:24,090
- You fit through there?
- It's the only way, this way.

1276
02:04:28,090 --> 02:04:31,090
It's in here. It's through here,
it's tight, but you can get through.

1277
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,690
It's where it hid.

1278
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:12,430
So all of this was under Derry...

1279
02:05:12,790 --> 02:05:15,030
- Like forever?
- No, not forever.

1280
02:05:15,830 --> 02:05:17,760
Just a few billion years.

1281
02:05:53,090 --> 02:05:56,130
IT can only be attacked in IT's true form.

1282
02:05:56,630 --> 02:05:59,560
- The ritual will show us.
- What is IT's true form?

1283
02:05:59,630 --> 02:06:04,630
I hope it's a puppy, Pomeranian.
I'll shut up.

1284
02:06:05,730 --> 02:06:07,030
It's light...

1285
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:12,930
Light that must be snuffed out by darkness.

1286
02:06:25,590 --> 02:06:29,730
Your artifacts, place them in the fire.

1287
02:06:30,260 --> 02:06:32,130
The past must burn with the present.

1288
02:06:40,730 --> 02:06:44,630
This is the boat that I built...

1289
02:06:46,660 --> 02:06:48,090
with Georgie

1290
02:06:52,760 --> 02:06:55,390
My inhaler

1291
02:07:00,730 --> 02:07:02,230
Come on, dude.

1292
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:07,160
Something that I wish I held on to.

1293
02:07:11,660 --> 02:07:16,930
This is a page from my yearbook.
Only one person signed it.

1294
02:07:17,660 --> 02:07:20,260
I probably should have forgotten it...

1295
02:07:21,330 --> 02:07:23,760
But I couldn't.
Because I kept it in my wallet

1296
02:07:25,390 --> 02:07:27,490
For 27 years.

1297
02:07:32,930 --> 02:07:36,530
- This is a token from the Capital Theater.
- You brought an actual token?

1298
02:07:36,590 --> 02:07:40,030
- Yeah, that's what we were supposed to do, asshole..
- Do you have any idea how long it's gonna take to burn?

1299
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:42,490
- Yeah, but so is your inhaler, dude.
- Guys, come on.

1300
02:07:42,560 --> 02:07:45,060
The toxic fumes and plastic and shit. So?

1301
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,290
Look closely Bev. You see it?

1302
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:56,760
- It's where you hit Bowers.
- The rock fight.

1303
02:07:59,130 --> 02:08:03,660
- The day these bonds were forged.
- That's not gonna burn either.

1304
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:10,160
Oh, wait

1305
02:08:13,730 --> 02:08:16,860
Can't be without Stan, again.

1306
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:27,430
Okay, grab hands, come on.

1307
02:08:35,290 --> 02:08:38,790
The ritual of the Chüd
its a battle of wills.

1308
02:08:40,190 --> 02:08:41,960
The first step was our reunion.

1309
02:08:42,890 --> 02:08:46,360
The second was to gather the tokens.

1310
02:08:48,590 --> 02:08:50,090
This is the final step.

1311
02:08:53,860 --> 02:08:55,230
What the?

1312
02:09:03,890 --> 02:09:06,690
What the fuck is that?
- Don't look at it. Don't look

1313
02:09:06,760 --> 02:09:08,240
- The dead lights.
- Don't look at them.

1314
02:09:08,390 --> 02:09:11,730
- Okay.
- Turn the light into darkness (repeats). Say it!

1315
02:09:11,790 --> 02:09:13,090
- What?
- Say it!

1316
02:09:13,130 --> 02:09:21,130
Turn the light into darkness!

1317
02:09:22,990 --> 02:09:25,630
Turn the light into darkness!

1318
02:09:38,130 --> 02:09:40,670
Turn the light into darkness!
Mike, what's happening, man?

1319
02:09:40,690 --> 02:09:42,060
Keep chanting!

1320
02:09:42,090 --> 02:09:43,460
Turn the light into darkness!

1321
02:09:46,660 --> 02:09:51,360
Turn the light into darkness!

1322
02:09:53,860 --> 02:09:56,890
Keep chanting!

1323
02:10:00,930 --> 02:10:04,430
Turn the light into darkness!
Is it working, did we do it?

1324
02:10:07,830 --> 02:10:09,390
What is this? Is this part of it?

1325
02:10:09,430 --> 02:10:12,330
- Mike, is this supposed to be happening?
- Keep chanting.

1326
02:10:12,430 --> 02:10:14,130
- What?
- Keep chanting.

1327
02:10:14,160 --> 02:10:17,560
- Turn the light into darkness.
- Come on, light into dark.

1328
02:10:17,590 --> 02:10:20,330
- Continue, it's working.

1329
02:10:25,130 --> 02:10:26,760
Hey, hey!

1330
02:10:30,830 --> 02:10:32,190
Shit.

1331
02:10:34,930 --> 02:10:36,190
Move, move.

1332
02:10:46,460 --> 02:10:49,690
Bev

1333
02:10:50,030 --> 02:10:52,430
- You okay?
- I can't hear shit, I can't hear shit.

1334
02:10:52,490 --> 02:10:53,790
- You alright?
- Yeah, no, no, no. no.

1335
02:10:53,860 --> 02:10:56,160
- Where's Mike?
- Mike!

1336
02:10:56,230 --> 02:10:57,630
- Mike!
- Mike!

1337
02:10:57,760 --> 02:11:00,460
- I'm here. Alright guys.
- Did we do it?

1338
02:11:00,530 --> 02:11:03,760
Did we do it, did we do it.
We put the tokens in the thing.

1339
02:11:03,830 --> 02:11:05,430
That's good, right? We did it, right?

1340
02:11:08,560 --> 02:11:11,290
- Shit!
- Ooooh Did it work, Mikey?

1341
02:11:11,360 --> 02:11:12,930
Did it work? (laughing)

1342
02:11:14,730 --> 02:11:18,590
Tell them why your silly
little ritual didn't work.

1343
02:11:19,160 --> 02:11:22,990
Tell them it's all just ...what's the word?

1344
02:11:23,490 --> 02:11:24,630
Placebo?

1345
02:11:25,890 --> 02:11:28,830
- Mike, what's he talking about?
- Mikey?

1346
02:11:29,830 --> 02:11:34,860
Mikey, you never showed
them the fourth side, right?

1347
02:11:36,590 --> 02:11:43,130
You didn't want them to know what actually happened
to the poor Shakopee. Aw dum, dum dum dum.

1348
02:11:52,190 --> 02:11:56,160
- Fuck Mikey, you lied to us again?
- No.

1349
02:11:56,190 --> 02:11:59,590
They didn't, they didn't believe that it would
kill him. that's why it didn't work back then.

1350
02:11:59,660 --> 02:12:02,760
Are you fucking kidding, Mike? Fuck!

1351
02:12:02,830 --> 02:12:04,290
Fuck you, Mikey!

1352
02:12:04,590 --> 02:12:09,290
I needed something. Anything we were supposed
to remember, we were supposed to believe.

1353
02:12:09,360 --> 02:12:10,790
- Fuck!
- Shit!

1354
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:21,660
The dead lights. Don't look at them.

1355
02:12:26,990 --> 02:12:31,390
27 years, I dreamt of you.

1356
02:12:33,590 --> 02:12:36,190
I craved you

1357
02:12:36,560 --> 02:12:39,360
Oh I missed you...

1358
02:12:39,430 --> 02:12:40,960
Mike, back off!

1359
02:12:41,030 --> 02:12:45,990
I waited for this very moment.

1360
02:12:46,660 --> 02:12:48,790
- Move, Mikey.
- Sorry.

1361
02:12:48,860 --> 02:12:50,360
I'm sorry guys. I'm sorry.

1362
02:12:50,430 --> 02:12:53,790
- I'm sorry.
- It's time to float.

1363
02:12:56,130 --> 02:12:58,190
- Shit!
- Sorry.

1364
02:12:59,730 --> 02:13:01,660
Wake up, Mike. Get him up, get him up.

1365
02:13:03,890 --> 02:13:04,930
Shit!

1366
02:13:16,290 --> 02:13:17,630
Come on, come on, come on!

1367
02:13:21,830 --> 02:13:22,990
Bill!

1368
02:13:35,830 --> 02:13:37,560
Go! Go! Go!

1369
02:13:42,090 --> 02:13:44,430
- Where's Bill?
- Don't worry, we'll find a way out.

1370
02:14:05,330 --> 02:14:07,560
Aw shit, can he see us?

1371
02:14:08,490 --> 02:14:10,430
He sees us!

1372
02:14:11,390 --> 02:14:12,660
Oh shit!

1373
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:17,360
- Run for your life!
- Shit!

1374
02:14:18,590 --> 02:14:20,830
Shit, you're kidding.

1375
02:14:26,660 --> 02:14:28,660
Where do we go?

1376
02:14:37,190 --> 02:14:38,490
No!

1377
02:14:58,760 --> 02:15:02,260
Damn it. -uh, uh,
not scary at all, alright?

1378
02:15:02,530 --> 02:15:06,890
No, they're flipped. He's fucking with us.

1379
02:15:07,490 --> 02:15:08,490
Are you sure?

1380
02:15:08,560 --> 02:15:10,860
- Trust me.
- Positive. - Yes

1381
02:15:15,760 --> 02:15:17,560
Where's my shoe?

1382
02:15:29,760 --> 02:15:32,390
You told me to trust you!!

1383
02:15:34,060 --> 02:15:36,390
He's not fucking with us,
let's go to not scary at all.

1384
02:15:36,460 --> 02:15:37,630
Okay.

1385
02:15:43,930 --> 02:15:45,390
It's alright, let's go.

1386
02:15:48,290 --> 02:15:50,130
Shit.

1387
02:15:52,130 --> 02:15:56,090
- No way am I falling for this shit again.
- Oh yeah, that thing's a fucking monster.

1388
02:15:56,390 --> 02:15:59,830
- We should make it sit.
- I know your moves, you little bitch.

1389
02:16:02,730 --> 02:16:07,390
- Richie, it's gone man.
- Yes, okay, wait.

1390
02:16:07,460 --> 02:16:08,790
It's okay.

1391
02:16:10,090 --> 02:16:13,790
- Sit!
- It did it.

1392
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:17,090
- Aww, that's cute, - That's a good boy.

1393
02:16:17,160 --> 02:16:18,390
That's a good boy.

1394
02:16:25,030 --> 02:16:28,430
Shit, next time we just go regular scary.

1395
02:16:28,490 --> 02:16:29,630
Next time?

1396
02:16:42,160 --> 02:16:44,560
I lost it, Billy.

1397
02:16:46,230 --> 02:16:49,230
It just floated off

1398
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:54,960
I'm not mad at you

1399
02:16:55,990 --> 02:16:59,060
It's your fault, what happened, isn't it?

1400
02:17:01,160 --> 02:17:04,360
You weren't really that
sick that morning, were you?

1401
02:17:06,990 --> 02:17:10,590
No, I just...

1402
02:17:11,630 --> 02:17:15,090
Pretending because I didn't
want to play with you.

1403
02:17:18,460 --> 02:17:20,290
I just didn't want to

1404
02:17:21,360 --> 02:17:24,360
You lied and I died.

1405
02:17:25,030 --> 02:17:27,890
You lied and I died.

1406
02:17:28,630 --> 02:17:36,630
You lied and I died! (repeating)

1407
02:17:36,860 --> 02:17:38,690
It happened because of me Georgie, me.

1408
02:17:48,290 --> 02:17:55,660
You lied and I died!

1409
02:18:28,130 --> 02:18:30,160
You little shit, I can smell you!

1410
02:18:31,230 --> 02:18:33,330
You smell just like Lois Lane.

1411
02:18:34,330 --> 02:18:35,790
Here's Johnny...

1412
02:19:15,730 --> 02:19:19,060
All that success. All those sit-ups.

1413
02:19:19,090 --> 02:19:24,130
But deep down you're still just
a little fat, fat, fatty loser.

1414
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:29,130
You always knew you would die alone.

1415
02:19:30,690 --> 02:19:32,630
Nooooo!

1416
02:19:35,530 --> 02:19:37,630
- Slut!
- Help!

1417
02:19:40,430 --> 02:19:41,860
Beverly!

1418
02:19:42,590 --> 02:19:46,290
Bevy, just open up the door for me. okay?

1419
02:19:46,790 --> 02:19:50,430
- Beverly, can you hear me?
- No!

1420
02:19:50,490 --> 02:19:54,260
- Come to Daddy, now.
- Bev, don't listen!

1421
02:19:56,360 --> 02:20:00,290
- Bev!
- Are you still my little girl, Bevy?

1422
02:20:02,290 --> 02:20:06,090
- Beverly, I love you!
- Ben?

1423
02:20:06,160 --> 02:20:10,790
Are you still my little girl, Bevy?

1424
02:20:10,860 --> 02:20:12,390
Are you still my little girl?
- Not anymore.

1425
02:20:16,960 --> 02:20:19,130
Your hair is winter fire,

1426
02:20:20,290 --> 02:20:22,060
January embers.

1427
02:20:22,690 --> 02:20:25,260
- My heart...
- Ben!

1428
02:20:27,190 --> 02:20:30,160
- My heart...
- Ben!

1429
02:20:32,730 --> 02:20:34,030
Ben!

1430
02:20:34,930 --> 02:20:36,260
Bev!

1431
02:20:37,930 --> 02:20:41,430
Ben!

1432
02:21:03,490 --> 02:21:08,560
- January embers.
- My heart burns there too.

1433
02:21:10,390 --> 02:21:11,730
It was you.

1434
02:21:26,890 --> 02:21:29,390
- You deserve to die.
- No.

1435
02:21:30,090 --> 02:21:34,460
You were the best big
brother there ever was.

1436
02:21:34,490 --> 02:21:37,130
No! We killed our little brother!

1437
02:21:38,490 --> 02:21:39,730
He loved you.

1438
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:43,390
And just because you didn't
want to play on a rainy day...

1439
02:21:44,530 --> 02:21:46,730
Just one time...

1440
02:21:48,530 --> 02:21:50,960
Does not make it your fault.

1441
02:22:02,060 --> 02:22:03,530
It never...

1442
02:22:05,960 --> 02:22:07,490
ever...

1443
02:22:10,490 --> 02:22:11,990
IT

1444
02:22:45,890 --> 02:22:47,160
Bill

1445
02:22:48,590 --> 02:22:49,690
Miss me?

1446
02:22:51,360 --> 02:22:54,930
I know what you are,
that's why I'm not afraid

1447
02:23:01,330 --> 02:23:04,060
I know what you are

1448
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:07,530
A madman.

1449
02:23:11,330 --> 02:23:12,660
Stop!

1450
02:23:13,530 --> 02:23:15,230
Hey, fuckface!

1451
02:23:21,590 --> 02:23:24,360
Do you want to play Truth or Dare?
Here's the truth...

1452
02:23:24,390 --> 02:23:27,530
You're a sloppy bitch. Yeah, that's right.

1453
02:23:27,590 --> 02:23:30,190
Let's Dance! Yippee ki-yay mother...

1454
02:24:03,230 --> 02:24:05,790
This kills monsters.
If you believe it does...

1455
02:24:06,260 --> 02:24:08,090
If you believe it does.

1456
02:24:10,860 --> 02:24:12,890
If you believe it does.

1457
02:24:13,460 --> 02:24:15,590
If you believe it does!

1458
02:24:17,190 --> 02:24:20,630
Beep beep, motherfucker!

1459
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:40,630
Holy shit.

1460
02:24:44,430 --> 02:24:47,060
Rich! No! Rich!

1461
02:24:47,090 --> 02:24:49,490
Hey Rich, wake up!

1462
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:51,630
Hey, yeah, there he is, buddy.

1463
02:24:51,690 --> 02:24:54,490
Richie, listen, I think I got 'em man.

1464
02:24:56,960 --> 02:25:00,260
I think I killed IT, I did,
I think I killed IT for real...

1465
02:25:01,790 --> 02:25:04,730
Noooooooo!

1466
02:25:04,760 --> 02:25:06,060
Eddie

1467
02:25:08,430 --> 02:25:09,730
Richie...

1468
02:25:12,690 --> 02:25:15,590
- Richie...
- No!

1469
02:25:18,530 --> 02:25:20,090
Noooo!

1470
02:25:21,590 --> 02:25:22,590
Eddie

1471
02:25:27,560 --> 02:25:29,630
Eddie!

1472
02:25:42,190 --> 02:25:43,430
Eddie!

1473
02:25:49,430 --> 02:25:50,590
It hurts

1474
02:25:51,890 --> 02:25:53,690
- Eddie!
- It hurts

1475
02:25:53,990 --> 02:25:55,560
- It hurts.
- Come on man.

1476
02:25:57,030 --> 02:25:58,460
Be careful, be careful.

1477
02:26:09,230 --> 02:26:11,690
Come out and play, losers.

1478
02:26:13,330 --> 02:26:15,690
He's hurt really bad,
we gotta get him out of here.

1479
02:26:15,890 --> 02:26:17,530
And how are we supposed to do that, Richie?

1480
02:26:21,330 --> 02:26:25,460
I almost killed IT, the leper.

1481
02:26:26,090 --> 02:26:27,830
My hands around his throat.

1482
02:26:29,130 --> 02:26:33,460
I could feel IT choking.
I made him small...

1483
02:26:39,130 --> 02:26:45,190
He seemed so weak... he seemed... so weak

1484
02:26:45,990 --> 02:26:47,160
The Shakopee

1485
02:26:48,260 --> 02:26:51,390
All living things must abide the
laws of the shape they inhabit.

1486
02:26:52,360 --> 02:26:56,360
Guys, there's a passageway, through here

1487
02:26:57,260 --> 02:27:01,960
The tunnel,
Pennywise has to make himself small

1488
02:27:02,030 --> 02:27:04,360
to get through the entrance
of the cavern, right?

1489
02:27:04,690 --> 02:27:07,690
So if we can get back there,
we can force him back down to size

1490
02:27:07,760 --> 02:27:08,390
Yes.

1491
02:27:08,590 --> 02:27:11,760
We make him small, small
enough, so we can kill him.

1492
02:27:13,730 --> 02:27:17,990
I can smell the stink of your fear.

1493
02:27:18,460 --> 02:27:22,430
- Let's go.
- Here, it's tight, It's tight. Be careful.

1494
02:27:36,690 --> 02:27:39,160
I need a little rest...

1495
02:27:42,530 --> 02:27:46,390
- Richie, I appreciate that, I gotta tell you something.
- What's up, buddy?

1496
02:27:49,730 --> 02:27:51,290
I fucked your mother.

1497
02:27:55,890 --> 02:27:57,330
Go, go!

1498
02:28:00,460 --> 02:28:01,660
Come on!

1499
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:16,030
- I got you!
- No!

1500
02:28:16,060 --> 02:28:21,060
- No!
- You filthy little children.

1501
02:28:21,290 --> 02:28:25,060
- You got a plan B. What the hell we're going to do now?
- You will die, that's you do.

1502
02:28:25,790 --> 02:28:26,790
Mike?

1503
02:28:29,490 --> 02:28:31,760
There's more than one way
to make someone small.

1504
02:28:34,890 --> 02:28:37,660
- Make him believe that he is.
- What?

1505
02:28:37,730 --> 02:28:42,290
- Make him believe that he is.
- Oh, me? Small? (laughing)

1506
02:28:43,130 --> 02:28:47,690
- I am the eater of worlds.
- Not to us. You're not.

1507
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,830
You're just a clown.

1508
02:28:57,130 --> 02:28:58,530
You're a weak old woman.

1509
02:29:01,430 --> 02:29:05,630
- Eater of worlds!
- A headless boy.

1510
02:29:07,490 --> 02:29:08,760
Impostor!

1511
02:29:10,160 --> 02:29:15,430
You are a mimic! A mimic!

1512
02:29:15,890 --> 02:29:18,090
You are a fucking bully!

1513
02:29:18,930 --> 02:29:23,960
- You're just a fucking clown!
- A dumb fucking clown!

1514
02:29:25,190 --> 02:29:26,430
Clown!

1515
02:29:28,090 --> 02:29:29,530
Fraud!

1516
02:29:32,090 --> 02:29:33,530
Clown!

1517
02:29:33,760 --> 02:29:35,930
- Cheater!
- Clown!

1518
02:29:37,230 --> 02:29:40,560
A motherfucking stupid mummy!

1519
02:29:42,690 --> 02:29:45,860
You're a clown!

1520
02:29:46,830 --> 02:29:48,130
Clown!

1521
02:29:48,190 --> 02:29:49,990
You're a clown!

1522
02:29:52,730 --> 02:29:54,760
Stupid clown

1523
02:29:55,590 --> 02:30:00,630
- You're a lowly clown motherfucker.
- Devourer of worlds.

1524
02:30:05,860 --> 02:30:07,060
Clown.

1525
02:30:07,590 --> 02:30:12,760
- You're just a clown.
- I am a eater of worlds.

1526
02:30:16,130 --> 02:30:17,390
Clown!

1527
02:30:18,260 --> 02:30:19,690
Stupid clown!

1528
02:30:19,990 --> 02:30:22,860
Clown!

1529
02:30:24,030 --> 02:30:25,160
Imposter.

1530
02:30:25,230 --> 02:30:31,030
Clown!

1531
02:30:33,790 --> 02:30:35,230
Clown.

1532
02:30:37,890 --> 02:30:42,230
A clown with a scared beating heart...

1533
02:31:29,390 --> 02:31:31,490
Look at you

1534
02:31:33,360 --> 02:31:37,930
You're all grown up...

1535
02:32:41,760 --> 02:32:43,230
Eddie!

1536
02:32:46,460 --> 02:32:48,790
Hey Ed, we got Pennywise, man.

1537
02:32:50,830 --> 02:32:52,030
Eddie?

1538
02:33:04,790 --> 02:33:08,030
- Richie.
- He's gone.

1539
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:09,970
He's alright, he's hurt,
we just gotta get him out of here.

1540
02:33:09,990 --> 02:33:10,990
He's hurt, Ben.

1541
02:33:11,460 --> 02:33:14,190
No, he's okay,
we have to get him out of here, Bev.

1542
02:33:15,090 --> 02:33:16,330
Richie...

1543
02:33:19,830 --> 02:33:22,690
- What?
- I, I think he's dead.

1544
02:33:26,360 --> 02:33:29,560
- We have to go, come on, come on, Richie.
- We have to go.

1545
02:33:30,130 --> 02:33:31,730
Come on buddy. Let's go.

1546
02:33:36,030 --> 02:33:37,560
We have to go.

1547
02:33:38,890 --> 02:33:41,260
Wait guys. We can still help him!

1548
02:33:42,560 --> 02:33:45,760
- Let him go.
- Guys, we can still help him!

1549
02:33:58,090 --> 02:34:01,530
No, Eddie! Eddie!

1550
02:34:06,390 --> 02:34:07,830
Come on!

1551
02:34:12,530 --> 02:34:13,930
Fast!

1552
02:34:16,690 --> 02:34:18,060
Move!

1553
02:34:23,590 --> 02:34:25,030
Move, move!

1554
02:34:25,530 --> 02:34:26,830
Run!

1555
02:34:40,860 --> 02:34:43,390
Eddie!

1556
02:34:45,860 --> 02:34:48,960
We have to help him, he's still in there!

1557
02:34:59,760 --> 02:35:03,290
Eddie!

1558
02:36:02,560 --> 02:36:06,430
You know what?
Eddie would've hated this, guys.

1559
02:36:07,330 --> 02:36:11,590
- What? Cleaning ourselves in dirty water?
- Yes.

1560
02:36:11,690 --> 02:36:14,860
He would be telling us that
we'd get streptocockle-something

1561
02:36:15,490 --> 02:36:19,390
- Yeah. But he would've made us laugh though.
- Yeah.

1562
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:25,330
He'd be looking out for us.
The way he always was.

1563
02:36:29,560 --> 02:36:31,060
Isn't that right, Richie?

1564
02:36:34,430 --> 02:36:35,460
Hey...

1565
02:37:07,530 --> 02:37:08,760
Thank you.

1566
02:37:09,160 --> 02:37:12,330
I don't have my glasses on, so I don't
know who you people are, but thank you.

1567
02:37:14,860 --> 02:37:17,630
- I really can't find my glasses.
- You're serious?

1568
02:37:17,790 --> 02:37:20,860
- Glasses?
- They were around here somewhere.

1569
02:37:26,830 --> 02:37:28,260
- I can't see them.
- Oh I see them right there.

1570
02:37:28,290 --> 02:37:31,730
- Where?
- Look, if you just go like...

1571
02:37:32,530 --> 02:37:34,090
Does anybody have any luck...

1572
02:38:36,230 --> 02:38:40,330
Hey guys... Look.

1573
02:38:49,860 --> 02:38:51,660
Nothing lasts forever.

1574
02:39:11,930 --> 02:39:15,730
I can't go home like this
guys, my mom will kill me.

1575
02:39:15,830 --> 02:39:18,060
Dude, you've been gone for
like 24 straight hours.

1576
02:39:18,130 --> 02:39:20,260
Your face is definitely
on a milk carton by now.

1577
02:39:20,390 --> 02:39:22,690
Also that puke smells worse
than your mom's slippers

1578
02:39:22,730 --> 02:39:23,930
Shut up, Richie.

1579
02:39:23,990 --> 02:39:27,490
First of all, my mom's slippers
smell like potpourri, asshole.

1580
02:39:27,660 --> 02:39:28,790
No they don't.

1581
02:39:28,960 --> 02:39:33,360
- Yes they do, and also how would you know what they smell like in the first place.
- Can we just keep it quiet?

1582
02:39:33,430 --> 02:39:34,460
- There's potpourri all
over my bathroom. -Eddie

1583
02:39:34,490 --> 02:39:37,990
Potpourri is literally a
French word for a rotten pot.

1584
02:40:01,030 --> 02:40:03,030
- Mike?
- Hey.

1585
02:40:03,490 --> 02:40:05,130
I just thought I'd check up on you.

1586
02:40:06,090 --> 02:40:08,490
You know, just to see, if you'd
learn how to finish a book for once.

1587
02:40:10,860 --> 02:40:12,590
I just finished the first chapter.

1588
02:40:14,360 --> 02:40:18,090
And I think, I actually know
where I'm going this time.

1589
02:40:18,530 --> 02:40:21,490
- Good.
- Say can I ask you a question?

1590
02:40:21,560 --> 02:40:22,630
<i>Sure.</i>

1591
02:40:24,060 --> 02:40:28,090
Why do you think we're not
forgetting, you know, like last time?

1592
02:40:28,930 --> 02:40:30,530
Maybe because IT's dead.

1593
02:40:33,760 --> 02:40:35,590
Or maybe because we have more that
we want to remember than we want

1594
02:40:35,660 --> 02:40:39,090
- to forget.
- I like that one.

1595
02:40:43,290 --> 02:40:45,790
You decided what you wanted to do?
About leaving Derry?

1596
02:40:45,860 --> 02:40:51,490
Man I've been in this town for 27 years.
Just staying where it wanted me to.

1597
02:40:55,030 --> 02:40:57,590
I think it's time I saw
the sky for a change.

1598
02:40:58,830 --> 02:41:00,330
<i>Go get it, Mikey.</i>

1599
02:41:01,430 --> 02:41:04,730
- Did you get the letter?
- What letter?

1600
02:41:05,160 --> 02:41:06,630
You'll know when you see it...

1601
02:41:08,030 --> 02:41:11,490
- Hold on, I just got the mail.
- We all got one.

1602
02:41:14,190 --> 02:41:19,430
- Patricia Uris?
- Just... just read it.

1603
02:41:20,030 --> 02:41:23,390
- Okay.
- And call me, anytime.

1604
02:41:24,230 --> 02:41:26,130
- Come on.
- Bill.

1605
02:41:32,290 --> 02:41:35,590
- I love you man.
- I love you too.

1606
02:41:36,430 --> 02:41:38,790
<i>Alright, see you.</i>

1607
02:42:05,830 --> 02:42:07,290
<i>Dear losers,</i>

1608
02:42:08,290 --> 02:42:12,330
<i>I know what this must seem like,
but this isn't a suicide note.</i>

1609
02:42:14,060 --> 02:42:16,830
<i>You're probably wondering
why I did what I did</i>

1610
02:42:17,790 --> 02:42:20,590
<i>It was because I knew I
was too scared to go back.</i>

1611
02:42:21,160 --> 02:42:22,690
<i>And if we weren't together</i>

1612
02:42:23,090 --> 02:42:25,760
<i>If all of us, alive, weren't united</i>

1613
02:42:26,330 --> 02:42:27,960
<i>Then, we would all die.</i>

1614
02:42:28,690 --> 02:42:32,660
<i>So, I made the only logical move</i>

1615
02:42:33,060 --> 02:42:35,030
<i>I took myself off of the board.</i>

1616
02:42:37,060 --> 02:42:38,360
<i>Did it work?</i>

1617
02:42:39,560 --> 02:42:42,260
<i>Well if you're reading
this, you know the answer.</i>

1618
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:46,760
<i>I've lived my whole life, afraid.</i>

1619
02:42:48,490 --> 02:42:51,530
<i>Afraid of what would come next</i>

1620
02:42:52,490 --> 02:42:54,960
<i>Afraid of what I might leave behind</i>

1621
02:42:57,630 --> 02:42:59,160
<i>Don't.</i>

1622
02:43:00,590 --> 02:43:02,590
<i>Be who you want to be.</i>

1623
02:43:04,160 --> 02:43:05,590
<i>And be proud.</i>

1624
02:43:06,360 --> 02:43:08,860
- You sleep okay?
- Yeah

1625
02:43:10,330 --> 02:43:11,890
I had a beautiful dream.

1626
02:43:12,790 --> 02:43:15,390
<i>And if you find someone worth holding onto</i>

1627
02:43:16,490 --> 02:43:19,360
<i>Never, ever let them go.</i>

1628
02:43:28,130 --> 02:43:29,960
<i>Follow your own path.</i>

1629
02:43:34,390 --> 02:43:36,090
<i>Wherever that takes you</i>

1630
02:43:42,260 --> 02:43:45,690
<i>Think of this letter as a promise</i>

1631
02:43:48,490 --> 02:43:52,730
<i>A promise I am asking you to make... To me</i>

1632
02:43:54,030 --> 02:43:55,360
<i>To each other</i>

1633
02:43:57,660 --> 02:43:58,930
<i>An oath.</i>

1634
02:44:02,390 --> 02:44:04,790
<i>You see the thing about being a loser is...</i>

1635
02:44:07,390 --> 02:44:09,590
<i>You don't have anything to lose</i>

1636
02:44:12,330 --> 02:44:13,430
<i>So...</i>

1637
02:44:14,190 --> 02:44:15,430
<i>Be true.</i>

1638
02:44:16,160 --> 02:44:17,690
<i>Be brave.</i>

1639
02:44:18,390 --> 02:44:19,690
<i>Stand.</i>

1640
02:44:20,230 --> 02:44:21,790
<i>Believe.</i>

1641
02:44:22,390 --> 02:44:24,530
<i>And don't ever forget...</i>

1642
02:44:25,790 --> 02:44:27,290
<i>We're losers</i>

1643
02:44:28,560 --> 02:44:30,690
<i>And we always will be...</i>
