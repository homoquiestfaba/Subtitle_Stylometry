[Woman] From the Northern
Tier in upstate New York,

4
00:01:48,559 --> 00:01:51,126
you're listening to the
sounds from Midnight Jazz.

5
00:01:52,463 --> 00:01:55,864
And now, it's the hour to settle
in to our late night block.

00:03:06,904 --> 00:03:08,370
Can I help you?

16
00:03:10,307 --> 00:03:11,640
Lookin' for Mark Walker.

17
00:03:14,978 --> 00:03:15,811
That's me.

[footsteps approaching]

20
00:03:23,287 --> 00:03:24,753
I heard a couple
of soldiers on base

21
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:26,221
talkin' about this place.

22
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,359
They say you help
soldiers get out.

23
00:03:34,865 --> 00:03:35,764
I'm a lawyer,

24
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,569
I try to make a case to
their legal discharge.

25
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,970
Like Specialist Tanaka?

26
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,339
You know Mike?

27
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,210
Yep, met him a few times.

28
00:03:51,615 --> 00:03:54,115
Yeah, I'm the one
that handling his case.

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,532
I'm a vet.

00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:13,134
Vietnam?

34
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:16,104
Yes.

35
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,707
Then you know about
going to Canada.

36
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:24,112
Why don't you have a seat
then and tell me your name.

37
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:26,348
No, I'm not sure I
wanna tell you my name.

38
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,683
Well, then it's gonna
be hard for me to help.

39
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,753
[gentle jazz music]

40
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:36,625
You behind this?

41
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:40,996
Yes, I'm one of the
people organizing.

your orders yet?

Not yet but it'll be soon.

48
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,661
I have a wife and
child to think about.

49
00:05:15,065 --> 00:05:16,898
Then let us get
you an appointment,

50
00:05:18,302 --> 00:05:22,771
and if you wanna bring your
wife, your family, that's fine.

51
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,707
I get a four day
pass next week.

52
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:27,375
Can I call you in a few days?

53
00:05:28,712 --> 00:05:29,611
Of course.

to do the laundry.

They called me in for an
emergency faculty meeting.

75
00:08:29,326 --> 00:08:31,025
Are your clothes in the
basket?

76
00:08:31,027 --> 00:08:33,895
Yes, and I left some
money on the table

77
00:08:33,897 --> 00:08:35,163

[Reporter] It has been
confirmed that personnel

81
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,978
of the United States
Army committed a series

82
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,815
of human rights violations
against detainees in Iraq

83
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,750
but it's not just overseas,

84
00:08:55,752 --> 00:08:58,553
here's Dee Santos with
an alarming update.

85
00:08:58,555 --> 00:09:00,655
Two soldiers on the
base have been accused

86
00:09:00,657 --> 00:09:03,124
by another soldier of
raping an Iraqi woman

87
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:06,895
and her mother during a dawn
raid in the suburbs of Baghdad.

88
00:09:06,897 --> 00:09:09,230
The Bush Administration has
been under attack lately

89
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:13,434
for letting the Army recruit
soldiers with criminal records.

90
00:09:13,436 --> 00:09:17,338

How you doing Captain?

115
00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:18,119
It's a morning,
like any other.

116
00:12:19,456 --> 00:12:20,288
[door shuts]

117
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,122
Coffee?

118
00:12:21,124 --> 00:12:22,724
Sure.

119
00:12:22,726 --> 00:12:24,592
See those guys out there?

120
00:12:24,594 --> 00:12:26,627
- [chuckles]
- Hard to miss.

121
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:31,265
All of 'em, they've been
picked up by the local cops

122
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:33,234
for drunk driving, all of them.

123
00:12:33,236 --> 00:12:35,937
Are they getting
evaluated for PTSD?

124
00:12:35,939 --> 00:12:37,338
Of course.

125
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,841
A Captain in here
yesterday, back from Iraq,

126
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:42,810
he had crashed his
motorcycle at the town dump

127
00:12:42,812 --> 00:12:45,213
and blew up the
transfer station.

128
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:47,081
He'd just bought the
motorcycle the day before,

129
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,850
he'd never even
driven one before.

130
00:12:49,652 --> 00:12:51,019
Can't say why.

131
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,520
Impulsive he said.

132
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,956
And so why is it so hard
for me to get your help?

133
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:57,658
If I get too successful
trying these cases

134
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,861
the Army will just put
me on the other side,

135
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,396
they'll make me a prosecutor.

136
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,298
That's not a pleasant arm.

137
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,267
What can I do
for you Mr. Walker?

138
00:13:07,637 --> 00:13:10,304
Some of my associates
aren't getting night passes.

139
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:11,672
How many soldiers
are we talking about?

140
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:15,710
Mm, I don't
know, 10, maybe 20.

141
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,046
Well the General knows
all about your place,

142
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,014
and your history.

143
00:13:21,351 --> 00:13:23,584
Call me, please.

144
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:27,822
[footsteps fading]

145
00:13:27,824 --> 00:13:30,558

[people chattering]

147
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,266
[Man] I'd like
to hear more about

148
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,468
the instant with
your staff sergeant.

149
00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:43,571
You went to him soon after
you started having problems

150
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:45,506
performing your duties.

151
00:13:45,508 --> 00:13:50,578
Yes, I, after Robby my
best buddy got killed,

152
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:55,817
I couldn't sleep and I was
feeling really low, you know?

153
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:59,353
So I went to Staff
Sergeant Connolly,

154
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:02,256
I was worried I
was gonna mess up,

155
00:14:03,359 --> 00:14:05,026
put me or somebody
else in danger.

156
00:14:05,962 --> 00:14:07,395
[Man] Then what happened?

157
00:14:08,498 --> 00:14:10,231
Well, he didn't
really say much

158
00:14:11,634 --> 00:14:14,068
but the next time I was with
the guys in my unit he...

159
00:14:15,004 --> 00:14:16,304
[Man] Go on specialist.

160
00:14:20,143 --> 00:14:25,213
He got behind me and
pretended, you know,

161
00:14:28,051 --> 00:14:31,619
I was a girl and
he was doing me.

162
00:14:33,223 --> 00:14:35,456
And he told the other guys
I was acting like a pussy

163
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:38,626
and this is what
you do to pussies.

164
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:47,201
[people chattering]

165
00:14:52,242 --> 00:14:53,708
How did it go?

166
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:54,942
All right I guess.

167
00:14:56,613 --> 00:14:57,845
I gotta get outta here.

168
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,649
Excuse me, Major,
I'm Mark Walker.

169
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,117
Mike Tanaka's attorney.

170
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:04,051
I know who you are.

171
00:15:04,053 --> 00:15:05,286
I have Dr. Mennard here

172
00:15:05,288 --> 00:15:06,921
who's come all the
way from Texas.

173
00:15:06,923 --> 00:15:08,523
We have his written report.

174
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:12,160
Okay, that report was
submitted six months ago.

175
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,896
I think that the Doctor
has additional information.

176
00:15:14,898 --> 00:15:17,064
I think it would be in
everybody's best interest

177
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,599
if he testified.

178
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,801
My client has been
treated very badly

179
00:15:20,803 --> 00:15:22,670
and I intend to pursue this case

180
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,405
if he doesn't get
a fair hearing.

181
00:15:28,478 --> 00:15:29,777
[footsteps fading]

182
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:31,512
They asked me things
all the way back

183
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,247
to my fucking childhood.

184
00:15:36,219 --> 00:15:37,218
When will I know?

185
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:42,857
Oh, the report will probably
come out eight or 10 weeks.

186
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:48,729
Thanks again for coming
all the way out doctor.

187
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:49,630
Of course.

188
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,401
Call you as soon
as I hear anything.

189
00:15:54,671 --> 00:15:58,172
- [footsteps pattering]
- He''ll be in real trouble,

190
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,707
if they take away his benefits.

191
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,976
Yeah, we'll make appeals
at every step of the way.

192
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:05,079
He was AWOL for a year.

193
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,216
You convince him.

194
00:16:09,619 --> 00:16:12,386
Fighting in a war and all
the bullshit that happened

195
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,722
to him over there
it's not enough.

196
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:18,726
The key is, proving that
Mike had a prior condition,

197
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:23,364
and they call this
a sanity here.

198
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:39,947
We were in the same platoon,
he hung himself in 1981.

199
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:46,153
[keys rattling]

200
00:16:46,155 --> 00:16:49,323
[car engine revving]

201
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,628
They remind me to keep working.

202
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,597
[soft piano music]

203
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,859
[coffee bubbling]

204
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,431
[footsteps fading]

205
00:17:35,004 --> 00:17:37,672
[morose music]

206
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:04,365
[phone ringing]

207
00:18:11,774 --> 00:18:12,673
Hello?

208
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,975
[birds chirping]

209
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,712
Oh, yes, that's me.

210
00:18:21,284 --> 00:18:23,684
Is your granddaughter
in the army?

211
00:18:25,588 --> 00:18:30,658
Okay, come and see me in
Watertown as soon as possible,

212
00:18:32,462 --> 00:18:34,595
But won't they arrest her?

213
00:18:34,597 --> 00:18:36,430
I can't let her go through that.

214
00:18:38,835 --> 00:18:39,767
I need to go.

215
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:40,601
[door opens]

216
00:18:40,603 --> 00:18:42,636
Thank you for your help.

217
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,206
[door closes]

218
00:18:46,909 --> 00:18:49,510
[baby fussing]

219
00:18:49,512 --> 00:18:52,480
Sh, sh, sh, do you
wanna say hi to Daddy?

220
00:18:56,819 --> 00:18:59,453
Hey, how's my
little guy today?

221
00:19:03,626 --> 00:19:06,594
So I was thinking
maybe we can all go out

222
00:19:06,596 --> 00:19:11,098
and do something
today off the base.

223
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,168
Sorry babe, I got
stuff to do.

224
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,770
What stuff?

225
00:19:15,772 --> 00:19:16,937
Christ, Maria, what?

226
00:19:16,939 --> 00:19:18,305
Do I have to explain
myself to you now?

227
00:19:18,307 --> 00:19:19,874
This happens to be
my job you know?

228
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:24,345
- [heavily breathing]
- What's going on with you?

229
00:19:24,347 --> 00:19:26,547
[footsteps approaching]

230
00:19:26,549 --> 00:19:27,448
What happened?

231
00:19:28,851 --> 00:19:32,553
They assigned me to march
in the Columbus Day parade,

232
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:34,588
it's such a fucking joke.

233
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,056
And have you called
the lawyer back?

234
00:19:36,058 --> 00:19:41,695
Shh, no, I have to schedule
another meeting in person.

235
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:48,068
I think you should.

236
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:50,504
Maybe he can help us.

237
00:19:52,809 --> 00:19:53,908
I love you.

238
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,075
I love you.

239
00:20:13,329 --> 00:20:17,298
[speaking in foreign language]

240
00:20:31,247 --> 00:20:32,813
[blinds rattling]

241
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,515
Jesus Christ!

242
00:20:34,517 --> 00:20:35,950
Get dressed.

243
00:20:35,952 --> 00:20:38,752
We have an appointment in
Watertown later this afternoon.

244
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,688
An appointment, what
are you talking about?

245
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,923
You can't hide
out here forever.

246
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,593
We're gonna go see a lawyer.

247
00:20:48,431 --> 00:20:51,432
[footsteps fading]

248
00:21:02,111 --> 00:21:04,211
[siren]

249
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:07,248
[suspenseful music]

250
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:19,760
[siren]

251
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:25,766
Its okay.

252
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:28,168
Its all right.

253
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,436
Hey, its okay.

254
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,206
Sh, sh, sh.

255
00:21:34,911 --> 00:21:37,211
I'm not going to lie to you.

256
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:40,014
This is not a
short, easy process,

257
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:44,018
but it begins with you
turning yourself in.

258
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,086
They're gonna put me
on the first plane back.

259
00:21:46,088 --> 00:21:48,122
I can guarantee you hearing,

260
00:21:48,124 --> 00:21:50,925
but I can't promise
you the outcome.

261
00:21:50,927 --> 00:21:53,527
So can you tell me why
you didn't report to duty?

262
00:21:55,331 --> 00:21:59,567
Come on honey, you were
different after the second tour,

263
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,136
she stays in bed most days,

264
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:05,172
she'd still be there now, if I
didn't make her come with me.

265
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:09,076
I'll need a
psychiatric evaluation

266
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:12,780
if we're going to pursue
a legal discharge.

267
00:22:12,782 --> 00:22:17,351
So they won't punish
her for deserting?

268
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:22,423
Right now, Cori
is classified AWOL.

269
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:23,791
I wanna keep it that way.

270
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,996
So then what am I hoping for?

271
00:22:28,998 --> 00:22:31,165
For now, a way out of hiding.

272
00:22:32,568 --> 00:22:34,501
Are they gonna say my
granddaughter's crazy?

273
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,370
Because it's the
war that's crazy.

274
00:22:36,372 --> 00:22:38,305
I already talked
to the army psychs.

275
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:43,510
[sniffing]

276
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:46,814
I did a tour in Vietnam.

277
00:22:51,587 --> 00:22:52,586
You were drafted?

278
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,631
You know what I was
doing when I signed up?

279
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:11,705
[heavily breathing]

280
00:23:11,707 --> 00:23:13,207
Army gave me a purpose.

281
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:16,710
I can't tell you what to do,

282
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,080
but if you're going
to work together,

283
00:23:20,082 --> 00:23:22,149
I need this to move forward.

284
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:27,888
You don't have to do this.

285
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:28,922
Just get it over with.

286
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:34,695
I signed up to pay for college.

287
00:23:37,433 --> 00:23:42,503
They trained me to drive
in the support convoys.

288
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:45,572
I didn't see too much combat.

289
00:23:46,542 --> 00:23:47,741
You saw combat?

290
00:23:50,112 --> 00:23:53,514
I was a gunner in a
Humvee a couple of times

291
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:59,953
and the army called
it, combat support.

292
00:24:00,756 --> 00:24:01,989
That's what they called it.

293
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:03,257
That's how they got
around the regulations

294
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:05,092
when they ran out of men.

295
00:24:06,962 --> 00:24:08,328
Did that make you angry?

296
00:24:10,032 --> 00:24:15,102
No, I was as good as the men.

297
00:24:17,673 --> 00:24:19,106
I liked the responsibility.

298
00:24:22,144 --> 00:24:24,945
Do you like working
under your superiors?

299
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:30,417
[heavily breathing]

300
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:34,421
In the military you don't
have much of a choice.

301
00:24:34,423 --> 00:24:35,789
You do what they tell you.

302
00:24:38,227 --> 00:24:43,297
It just that it can be an
issue, especially for women.

303
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:45,199
[sighs]

304
00:24:45,201 --> 00:24:46,834
Yeah, tell me about it.

305
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:49,136
What do you mean by that?

306
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:57,578
[heavily breathing]

307
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:07,121
I had some problems
with my staff sergeant.

308
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,530
Can you elaborate?

309
00:25:17,733 --> 00:25:20,801
[heavily breathing]

310
00:25:22,905 --> 00:25:27,975
He used to say shit to
me and I just ignored him.

311
00:25:30,212 --> 00:25:32,479
But, he started touching me,

312
00:25:41,223 --> 00:25:47,594
grabbing my butt,
shit like that.

313
00:25:51,801 --> 00:25:54,935
[heavily breathing]I
told my CO and he said

314
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:57,538
that there were more important
things to worry about.

315
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:04,278
And in a fucked up
way, I agreed with him.

316
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:07,414
We were in combat.

317
00:26:10,085 --> 00:26:11,018
People were-

318
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:16,256
- Nevertheless, what
he did was a crime.

319
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:19,226
The CO or the asshole?

320
00:26:19,228 --> 00:26:20,127
Both.

321
00:26:24,033 --> 00:26:25,332
I woke up one morning

322
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:30,404
and he was standing
right in my face,

323
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,478
with his fucking dick out.

324
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:45,118
And that's when I
fucking went nuts.

325
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:50,057
[sighs]

326
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:51,625
I would start screaming,

327
00:26:53,562 --> 00:26:55,929
[sighs]

328
00:26:55,931 --> 00:26:56,997
I went crazy.

329
00:26:58,434 --> 00:26:59,700
[sighs]

330
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,735
I went back to my fucking CO

331
00:27:05,808 --> 00:27:08,775
and he said he would
do something about it.

332
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:13,180
And a few weeks later,
the motherfucker,

333
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:17,985
was promoted to unit commander
somewhere fucking else.

334
00:27:23,626 --> 00:27:26,693
[heavily breathing]

335
00:27:30,833 --> 00:27:32,966
I have to ask you this,

336
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:35,936
do you ever have
suicidal thoughts?

337
00:27:41,043 --> 00:27:42,109
But I can't sleep.

338
00:27:46,448 --> 00:27:49,216
You know what never
sleeping feels like?

339
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,993
[heavily breathing]

340
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:08,268
[crying]

341
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,504
[wailing]

342
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:16,543
[heavily breathing]

343
00:28:18,681 --> 00:28:21,081
[screaming]

344
00:28:25,154 --> 00:28:27,921
[heavily breathing]

345
00:28:27,923 --> 00:28:30,724
[wind whooshing]

346
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:44,805
I don't know why we're doing
this,

347
00:28:44,807 --> 00:28:47,107
we're never gonna use
these fucking things.

348
00:28:47,109 --> 00:28:48,041
Hey, we've got that Appleby.

349
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:49,643
We as his way, we probably will.

350
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:52,045
Heads up boys we
jumping into Baghdad.

351
00:28:52,047 --> 00:28:54,314
Fucking Appleby only
cares about himself

352
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:56,383
those maneuvers were made
around Fallujah were bullshit.

353
00:28:56,385 --> 00:28:57,985
Hey, we're on patrol, man.

354
00:28:57,987 --> 00:29:00,053
Why you always ragging
on Appleby anyway?

355
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:02,289
Because we shouldn't have been
in the streets without backup.

356
00:29:02,291 --> 00:29:03,657
He just wanted his units
get combat time.

357
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:05,625
So we'll he can earn
his fucking medal.

358
00:29:05,627 --> 00:29:06,460
That's bullshit.

359
00:29:06,462 --> 00:29:07,627
Hey guys were home.

360
00:29:07,629 --> 00:29:09,229
Remember we aint
fighting no Haji's anymore.

361
00:29:09,231 --> 00:29:10,464
Shut up.

362
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:12,199
Look, he put our
unit in danger.

363
00:29:12,201 --> 00:29:13,600
He didn't give a fuck about us.

364
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:15,502
Yeah, you've been complaining
ever since we got back,

365
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,037
we were on a mission.

366
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,305
One of which I was proud
as hell to be a part of-

367
00:29:18,307 --> 00:29:19,773
- What's that gotta
do with Appleby?

368
00:29:19,775 --> 00:29:21,575
He almost got us killed so he could
shake hands with the president.

369
00:29:21,577 --> 00:29:22,943
Hey, will you guys chill out?

370
00:29:23,946 --> 00:29:25,545
Yeah again, I'll fuck you up.

371
00:29:25,547 --> 00:29:26,480
Are you're gonna beat
the shit out of me?

372
00:29:26,482 --> 00:29:27,681
Yeah, I'd like to see you try.

373
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,615
We have a little
of[indistinct]

374
00:29:28,617 --> 00:29:30,217
[thudding]
Hey, what the-

375
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:31,118
- Guys.

376
00:29:32,121 --> 00:29:35,789
[thudding]
[groaning]

377
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,157
All right that's enough.

378
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:38,792
Hey, hey stop.

379
00:29:38,794 --> 00:29:41,161
Stop it you stupid fucks. If anybody sees
this we'll be digging holes for weeks.

380
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:45,032
Oh, God.
[groaning]

381
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,133
Fuck man, you
really clipped me.

382
00:29:46,135 --> 00:29:47,868
Yeah, you damn right I did.

383
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,636
Yeah, well, I'm glad
we were able to discuss

384
00:29:49,638 --> 00:29:50,971
this like men.

385
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:52,305
What are you laughing at?

386
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,476
[laughing]
Give me a heart attack.

387
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:00,947
Crazy mother fuckers.

388
00:30:03,318 --> 00:30:05,552
[sobbing]

389
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:18,432
Hey, what's going on?

390
00:30:19,535 --> 00:30:21,468
Nothing man, just
get the shit done.

391
00:30:23,639 --> 00:30:26,273
[papers rustling]

392
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:29,242
[footsteps fading]

393
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,546
[panting]

394
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:35,248
[door opening]

395
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:38,185
Evaluation should
be back in a few days,

396
00:30:38,187 --> 00:30:39,419
and you're welcome
to take a look

397
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:41,588
before making any
final decisions.

398
00:30:42,691 --> 00:30:44,825
But if you decide
to give yourself up,

399
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:49,496
I need to schedule
a press conference.

400
00:30:49,498 --> 00:30:51,531
[seagulls squawking]

401
00:30:51,533 --> 00:30:54,034
Why, we didn't
talk about that?

402
00:30:54,036 --> 00:30:56,069
The army is lying
about how many soldiers

403
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:57,871
are coming back with problems.

404
00:30:57,873 --> 00:31:00,040
Yeah but, I'm a nobody.

405
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,342
And they don't want
me to speak out.

406
00:31:02,344 --> 00:31:06,313
If you stay silent,
nothing changes.

407
00:31:06,315 --> 00:31:08,348
[sighs]

408
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:20,360
I looked you up online,
said you were radical.

409
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:22,262
[sigh]

410
00:31:22,264 --> 00:31:25,532
Recently, or when
I was really one?

411
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,602
[chuckling]

412
00:31:28,604 --> 00:31:32,038
Nobody pays too much attention
to what I do any day now.

413
00:31:33,408 --> 00:31:35,175
My mom was always going
to meetings and protests

414
00:31:35,177 --> 00:31:37,611
when she was clean.

415
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:44,484
I remember she took me all
the way to Washington once

416
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,687
when I was 10 to
some abortion rally.

417
00:31:50,259 --> 00:31:51,925
That's when we lived in Detroit.

418
00:31:53,295 --> 00:31:54,561
I'm from Battle Creek.

419
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:57,330
No way.

420
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:00,834
My dad worked at
the Kellogg factory,

421
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,702
graduated from Wayne State.

422
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:03,670
[chuckling]

423
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,671
Wayne State, that's crazy.

424
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:08,408
[chuckling]
I almost went there.

425
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:09,509
I joined up instead.

426
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:15,916
Would you go back?

427
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:18,718
- [sighs]
- No one left to go back to.

428
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:23,857
Where is she now?

429
00:32:25,561 --> 00:32:26,459
Your mom.

430
00:32:27,396 --> 00:32:30,564
[seagulls squawking]

431
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:33,867
She cut out four
years before I left.

432
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:38,738
Even Roberta doesn't
know where she is.

433
00:32:40,509 --> 00:32:42,075
It's really beautiful up here.

434
00:32:48,183 --> 00:32:51,618
Spent most of my high
school years up in Syracuse.

435
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:54,321
I didn't even know a place
like this existed upstate.

436
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:59,626
[sighs]

437
00:32:59,628 --> 00:33:03,263
Just never thought I'd
be in this situation.

438
00:33:03,265 --> 00:33:06,433
[seagulls squawking]

439
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:10,670
[crickets chirping]

440
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:14,307
[gentle melancholic music]

441
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:22,949
[car engine revving]

442
00:33:22,951 --> 00:33:26,586
[gentle melancholic music]

443
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:38,064
[door shuts]

444
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:41,301
[footsteps pattering]

445
00:33:45,474 --> 00:33:48,208
[heavy panting]

446
00:33:56,918 --> 00:33:59,653
[heavy panting]

447
00:34:23,545 --> 00:34:26,279
[heavy panting]

448
00:34:42,798 --> 00:34:43,697
Cooper?

449
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,533
Hey, I thought that was you.

450
00:34:46,535 --> 00:34:49,069
Yo, shit man.

451
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,538
How you doing?

452
00:34:53,775 --> 00:34:54,774
Wrestler?

453
00:34:54,776 --> 00:34:56,543
Oh, yeah, it's
Jake these days.

454
00:34:58,613 --> 00:34:59,746
Man, I can't believe it.

455
00:34:59,748 --> 00:35:01,081
[chuckling]

456
00:35:01,083 --> 00:35:03,316
You, um, you know, like.

457
00:35:04,753 --> 00:35:06,953
No, I'm just on leave.

458
00:35:08,490 --> 00:35:10,223
Well you're not
allowed to be here.

459
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:12,859
Yeah, I know.

460
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:18,498
Listen, I gotta go
inside, drop something off.

461
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,369
Um, do you, I dunno, you wanna
like hang out afterwards,

462
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:23,269
get a beer.

463
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:26,239
Yeah.

464
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,241
Great, awesome.

465
00:35:29,344 --> 00:35:31,511
Meet me out here
in ten, all right?

466
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:32,345
All right.

467
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,246
All right.

468
00:35:35,117 --> 00:35:38,084
[footsteps fading]

469
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,825
You need some people
to drive ahead in cars.

470
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:50,497
You just can't walk from
Ithaca to Watertown.

471
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,401
I have to go, thank you.

472
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,770
Christian, man, I'm glad
that you can make it.

473
00:35:56,772 --> 00:35:58,805
Man, I know it's
been a lot of trouble

474
00:35:58,807 --> 00:36:01,174
getting passes off the
base and everything.

475
00:36:01,176 --> 00:36:03,476
No word on my petition then?

476
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:05,178
No, I'm sorry.

477
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,846
I'm here.

478
00:36:06,848 --> 00:36:11,251
Christian, this is
Dee Santos, News One.

479
00:36:11,253 --> 00:36:13,052
All right, lets go up on here.

480
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:16,990
The protesters are coming
in from Buffalo, Elmira,

481
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:19,058
Ithaca and Rochester.

482
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,828
So what I was hoping is
that we get some coverage

483
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,062
of them on the road.

484
00:36:23,064 --> 00:36:25,565
How many people
are we talking about?

485
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:26,666
500 maybe.

486
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:29,369
That's all?

487
00:36:29,371 --> 00:36:33,139
This is 2008, not 1968.

488
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:37,076
Okay, if I could get
information on the protester, s

489
00:36:37,078 --> 00:36:38,478
I can get you some stuff.

490
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,345
Alright.

491
00:36:40,515 --> 00:36:43,516
[footsteps fading]

492
00:36:51,326 --> 00:36:52,959
Look what the cat dragged in.

493
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:54,794
Nathaniel.

494
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:56,930
Hey Mr. New York lawyer,

495
00:36:56,932 --> 00:36:58,665
If I'm a New York lawyer,

496
00:36:58,667 --> 00:37:00,233
what the hell am
I doing up here?

497
00:37:00,235 --> 00:37:01,501
Yeah.

498
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:03,436
What the fuck are
you doing up here?

499
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:06,139
Just doing my duty, baby.

500
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,007
[chuckling]

501
00:37:08,009 --> 00:37:09,542
Christian would you
give this to Dee.

502
00:37:11,613 --> 00:37:14,414
So Mr. Wise cop, where
the fuck have you been?

503
00:37:14,416 --> 00:37:16,683
You're my main field organizer.

504
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,819
I know, I had my cell
off for a few days.

505
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:21,754
I had a bad weekend.

506
00:37:21,756 --> 00:37:23,323
I put up messages for you.

507
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:25,558
Anything happened?

508
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,327
I'm off the meds.

509
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,296
I've been working
up to it for awhile.

510
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:33,366
I'm impressed.

511
00:37:33,368 --> 00:37:34,634
How you feeling?

512
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:35,535
Less tired?

513
00:37:36,338 --> 00:37:39,305
And, I can get a hard on again.

514
00:37:39,307 --> 00:37:42,442
At my age you need pills for
that too.

515
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,744
[laughing]

516
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:47,614
All right baby come on.

517
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:51,718
There's a lady who wants to
see you.

518
00:37:55,457 --> 00:37:57,123
He was upset about
something this morning,

519
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,725
but he wouldn't tell me why.

520
00:37:58,727 --> 00:38:00,627
And then I went in this morning

521
00:38:00,629 --> 00:38:02,962
and saw he took a four day pass.

522
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,564
He asked about Canada.

523
00:38:04,566 --> 00:38:06,566
Well I discouraged
everyone from going that route

524
00:38:06,568 --> 00:38:10,069
it's not the same situation
as it was during Vietnam.

525
00:38:10,071 --> 00:38:13,273
NATO regulations
require that everyone

526
00:38:13,275 --> 00:38:15,708
honors the extradition treaty.

527
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,010
What does that mean?

528
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:22,081
There's no coming
back legally.

529
00:38:23,151 --> 00:38:25,652
He would never,
this is not like him.

530
00:38:25,654 --> 00:38:27,954
He believes strongly
in serving his country.

531
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,256
He's done two tours.

532
00:38:33,161 --> 00:38:35,028
He's not the man
that I married.

533
00:38:40,268 --> 00:38:43,970
No I wonder, yeah, what
happened [indistinct]

534
00:38:43,972 --> 00:38:46,105
Yeah, I was in a
hospital in San Diego,

535
00:38:49,444 --> 00:38:50,677
[chuckling]

536
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,478
nearly lost my leg from
where the IED hit me,

537
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:57,684
and those motherfuckers,
they want to send me back,

538
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:00,386
said I was fine, you know?

539
00:39:01,489 --> 00:39:03,389
No way I was going
the fuck back there.

540
00:39:04,492 --> 00:39:06,793
So, you know I saw
this thing, right.

541
00:39:06,795 --> 00:39:08,728
About the soldier that

00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:11,190
I don't think there's
anyone in there.

720
00:50:14,562 --> 00:50:15,828
You have an appointment?

721
00:50:17,999 --> 00:50:19,064
Yeah, 3:00 PM.

722
00:50:24,505 --> 00:50:25,804
You in the service too?

723
00:50:32,647 --> 00:50:33,712
Where you stationed?

724
00:50:37,184 --> 00:50:40,486
Camp Luka in Avijan.

725
00:50:41,622 --> 00:50:43,155
Generator city.

726
00:50:43,157 --> 00:50:44,456
Never got there.

727
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:45,457
You didn't miss much.

728
00:50:46,494 --> 00:50:47,559
I'm Darien Cooper.

729
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:50,095
Nice to meet you.

730
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,299
Cori.

731
00:50:57,972 --> 00:50:59,571
Wanna try the door.

732
00:51:03,344 --> 00:51:04,209
Yeah.

733
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,788
[footsteps approaching]

734
00:51:17,024 --> 00:51:19,558
[door closes]

735
00:51:21,262 --> 00:51:22,161
Walker?

736
00:51:25,266 --> 00:51:26,165
You here?

737
00:51:32,807 --> 00:51:33,706
Walker?

738
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,346
Oh, shit, call 911.

739
00:51:43,451 --> 00:51:44,450
Its okay.

740
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:45,384
No hospitals.

741
00:51:45,386 --> 00:51:46,552
I'll go get some water.

742
00:51:47,888 --> 00:51:50,589
I don't know how fucking long
I've been in this bathroom.

743
00:51:52,059 --> 00:51:52,958
What happened?

744
00:51:55,229 --> 00:51:57,529
I'm not sure, blacked out.

745
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,897
We should call a doctor.

746
00:51:58,899 --> 00:51:59,832
No, no, no.

747
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:02,768
[heavily breathing]

748
00:52:02,770 --> 00:52:05,838
Give me a hand, okay.

749
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:06,672
Ready?

750
00:52:06,674 --> 00:52:07,740
Yeah.

751
00:52:07,742 --> 00:52:09,108
Three, two, one.

752
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:11,977
[heavily punting]

753
00:52:20,688 --> 00:52:21,687
On the couch?

754
00:52:21,689 --> 00:52:22,688
Oh, yeah.

755
00:52:24,158 --> 00:52:25,057
Okay.

756
00:52:28,763 --> 00:52:30,028
I got it here.

757
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:36,568
[exhales sharply]

758
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:42,007
I'm sorry.

759
00:52:42,009 --> 00:52:43,175
What time is it?

760
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:46,378
A little after three.

761
00:52:50,151 --> 00:52:52,017
I can come back later.

762
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,620
Maybe it's best.

763
00:52:54,622 --> 00:52:57,356
This is not good for both of
you to be here together here.

764
00:52:57,358 --> 00:52:58,924
What difference does it make?

765
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,560
I'm gonna be out
tomorrow anyways.

766
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:07,399
I've been AWOL for six months.

767
00:53:08,903 --> 00:53:11,804
Walker's scheduled a press
conference here tomorrow nights.

768
00:53:11,806 --> 00:53:14,973
And after I'm giving myself up.

769
00:53:16,243 --> 00:53:17,109
Why?

770
00:53:19,313 --> 00:53:21,814
So that people could
know what happened to her.

771
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:24,983
No, no, no, I get that.

772
00:53:24,985 --> 00:53:29,121
I mean, why'd you leave?

773
00:53:34,261 --> 00:53:39,832
I don't know, just lay in bed.

774
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:43,836
Miss my flight out.

775
00:53:47,174 --> 00:53:48,740
I knew how serious it was.

776
00:53:52,513 --> 00:53:54,780
Yeah, I should probably
go, like you said.

777
00:53:54,782 --> 00:53:57,716
Can you come back later and
we don't have a lot of time

778
00:53:57,718 --> 00:53:59,251
to block you with deployment.

779
00:53:59,253 --> 00:54:01,119
Army thinks I'm
perfectly fit to go back.

780
00:54:01,121 --> 00:54:02,354
Maybe I am.

781
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:04,189
But you know that
doesn't mean anything.

782
00:54:05,025 --> 00:54:06,492
They sending everybody back.

783
00:54:12,466 --> 00:54:15,367
[exhales sharply]

784
00:54:21,208 --> 00:54:22,307
Good luck tomorrow.

785
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:24,576
Thanks.

786
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:34,486
How are you feeling?

787
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:38,957
Better.

788
00:54:43,564 --> 00:54:45,330
Ooh, yeah.

789
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:52,170
You don't have to say anything
you don't want to tomorrow.

790
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:55,474
What do you mean?

791
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,544
The psychiatrist she said,

792
00:54:58,546 --> 00:55:01,780
wrote in her report
that she has some issue

793
00:55:01,782 --> 00:55:04,416
with your staff sergeant.

794
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:15,928
Yeah, they definitely don't
pay for that shit in basic.

795
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,533
[exhales sharply]

796
00:55:21,535 --> 00:55:22,701
Did she see him again?

797
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,573
Yeah, he was around,

798
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:32,311
I need some air.

799
00:55:33,681 --> 00:55:37,549
Be careful, this is an army town

800
00:55:37,551 --> 00:55:39,251
and you don't
wanna be picked up.

801
00:55:56,403 --> 00:56:00,539
[footsteps approaching]

802
00:56:00,541 --> 00:56:02,441
Dirty fucking habit.

803
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,677
You done already?

804
00:56:07,681 --> 00:56:09,114
I need to walk.

805
00:56:10,551 --> 00:56:13,485
There's a lake about
half a mile that way.

806
00:56:14,822 --> 00:56:17,055
There won't be anybody
there this time of day.

807
00:56:17,057 --> 00:56:17,956
Thanks.

808
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:25,764
You should go on in.

809
00:56:29,603 --> 00:56:32,571
[footsteps fading]

810
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:38,810
[soft piano music]

811
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:14,346
[exhales sharply]

812
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:17,349
[soft piano music]

813
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:41,873
I really wanna thank
you for coming out tonight

814
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,243
to offer your support for
specialist Cori Gibson.

815
00:57:45,245 --> 00:57:47,012
[audience applauding]

816
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:48,180
Come on.

817
00:57:48,182 --> 00:57:50,415
Who up into six
months ago was in Iraq

818
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:53,452
with the 414th
Transportation Company.

819
00:57:53,454 --> 00:57:57,055
Specialist Gibson was
ordered back to Iraq

820
00:57:57,057 --> 00:58:00,659
for a third tour,
suffering from PTSD.

821
00:58:00,661 --> 00:58:01,860
She went AWOL.

822
00:58:01,862 --> 00:58:03,328
To stop that by now?

823
00:58:03,330 --> 00:58:06,932
Plus she's gonna turn
herself in tomorrow morning-

824
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:08,100
- I understand you orders-

825
00:58:08,102 --> 00:58:09,968
- For Drummer, in order
to pursue her case

826
00:58:09,970 --> 00:58:11,503
for a legal discharge.

827
00:58:11,505 --> 00:58:12,671
Specialist Gibson.

828
00:58:12,673 --> 00:58:14,072
You're interrupting, sir.

829
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,775
We have orders to take
Specialists Gibson back to base.

830
00:58:17,878 --> 00:58:19,611
Go back, well continue
this right here.

831
00:58:19,613 --> 00:58:22,080
Miss Gibson's gonna turn
herself in tomorrow morning.

832
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,616
The judge advocate is
familiar with this situation-

833
00:58:24,618 --> 00:58:25,984
- I don't know anything
about that sir,

834
00:58:25,986 --> 00:58:28,120
we have orders to take
Specialist Gibson back to base.

835
00:58:28,122 --> 00:58:30,388
Christian, get Layton on
the phone for me, please.

836
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:31,757
Sir, you can do
whatever you want,

837
00:58:31,759 --> 00:58:33,625
but I will have to call
the civilian police

838
00:58:33,627 --> 00:58:34,893
if you try to interfere.

839
00:58:36,330 --> 00:58:39,464
[indistinct chatter]

840
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:44,970
I'm sorry, you're gonna
have to go with them.

841
00:58:44,972 --> 00:58:47,072
[indistinct chatter]

842
00:58:47,074 --> 00:58:48,607
I don't understand.

843
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:51,109
[indistinct chatter]

844
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:54,079
We'll figure this out
when I get to the judge.

845
00:58:54,081 --> 00:58:55,046
[Reporter] Cori?

846
00:58:56,884 --> 00:58:58,250
[Roberta] Oh my.

847
00:58:58,252 --> 00:59:00,018
[handcuffs clicking]

848
00:59:00,020 --> 00:59:01,286
[indistinct chatter]

849
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:03,288
[Reporter] Cori, Cori?

850
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,290
Cori, is there
anything you wanna say?

851
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:08,894
[indistinct chatter]

852
00:59:08,896 --> 00:59:10,495
[Reporter] Cori?

853
00:59:10,497 --> 00:59:13,665
[indistinct chatter]

854
00:59:13,667 --> 00:59:15,133
Come in tighter.

855
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,802
I'll be at the base
first thing in the morning

856
00:59:16,804 --> 00:59:17,769
to figure out what
happened, okay?

857
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,137
[door slams]
[sobbing]

858
00:59:19,139 --> 00:59:20,806
We trusted you.

859
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,942
[car engine revving]

860
00:59:25,946 --> 00:59:31,016
[sirens]
[indistinct chatter]

861
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:34,953
[indistinct chatter]

862
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:39,858
Mr. Walker, do you
have anything to say?

863
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,792
Any comment?

864
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:47,499
[Peels] Now, I see you
had an exemplary record.

865
00:59:47,501 --> 00:59:49,234
What went wrong
when you came home?

866
00:59:50,838 --> 00:59:53,038
I just couldn't go back sir.

867
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:53,972
That's obvious,

868
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:56,541
but we'd like to know why.

869
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,709
Have you always
been a quitter?

870
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:58,777
Let her answer captain?

871
01:00:02,616 --> 01:00:04,549
I don't know
how to explain it.

872
01:00:04,551 --> 01:00:05,717
I just couldn't go back.

873
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:07,219
This is a fucking
waste of time.

874
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:08,486
Watch the language.

875
01:00:08,488 --> 01:00:10,555
Women like you give
all of us a bad name.

876
01:00:10,557 --> 01:00:12,891
Did you get along with your
fellow officers in the unit?

877
01:00:15,863 --> 01:00:17,896
For the most part sir, yes.

878
01:00:17,898 --> 01:00:19,865
What do you mean
for the most part?

879
01:00:21,101 --> 01:00:26,037
I had some trouble
with my staff sergeant

880
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:33,345
and my commanding officer, sir.

881
01:00:35,983 --> 01:00:37,182
What kind of trouble?

882
01:00:39,019 --> 01:00:42,520
I didn't agree with the way

883
01:00:42,522 --> 01:00:45,390
that they handled
some things, sir.

884
01:00:46,293 --> 01:00:47,759
That's too bad, but
it's not your place

885
01:00:47,761 --> 01:00:49,194
to challenge your
superior officer.

886
01:00:49,196 --> 01:00:51,162
I know, I know that captain.

887
01:00:51,164 --> 01:00:52,364
So what was the problem?

888
01:00:52,366 --> 01:00:53,565
Nothing captain.

889
01:00:54,968 --> 01:00:57,535
How did you feel when your
unit went back without you?

890
01:00:57,537 --> 01:00:59,471
I wish none of us
had to go back, sir.

891
01:00:59,473 --> 01:01:01,306
He's asking if you felt guilty

892
01:01:01,308 --> 01:01:03,108
about abandoning
your fellow soldiers.

893
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,844
I'm concerned that you're
not telling us everything.

894
01:01:05,846 --> 01:01:07,846
I'm not sure what you
want me to say, sir.

895
01:01:07,848 --> 01:01:09,281
Just the truth specialist.

896
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:16,221
I have sir.

897
01:01:16,223 --> 01:01:18,189
Then you are a coward.

898
01:01:18,191 --> 01:01:19,524
You're signed up for this job

899
01:01:19,526 --> 01:01:21,192
and you should finish
what you started.

900
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:23,495
What Captain
Rodriguez is saying

901

is the army will not
punish you for going AWOL.

If you decide to
rejoin your unit.

903
01:01:33,774 --> 01:01:35,340
Where's Walker?

904
01:01:40,347 --> 01:01:41,446
Where's my lawyer?

906
01:01:58,298 --> 01:01:59,531
Where is she?

907
01:01:59,533 --> 01:02:00,732
Someone should be
bringing her over.

908
01:02:00,734 --> 01:02:02,000
What the hell
happened last night?

909
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:04,402
How did they know about
the press conference?

910
01:02:04,404 --> 01:02:06,638
It wasn't exactly a secret.

911
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,640
Good morning,
Captain Leighton.

912
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:11,142
Captain, I thought you'd be
bringing Specialist Gibson.

913
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:12,911
No captain, General
Peels just told me

914
01:02:12,913 --> 01:02:14,346
to be at your office at eight.

915
01:02:14,348 --> 01:02:16,948
My client is under
extraordinary duress.

916
01:02:16,950 --> 01:02:19,718
She is depressed and
possibly suicidal.

the mental health clinic.

918
01:02:22,456 --> 01:02:23,955
I want to call the
MP headquarters.

919
01:02:23,957 --> 01:02:26,091
She's got to be
somewhere on this base.

[upbeat rousing music]

921
01:02:36,870 --> 01:02:38,236
Morning, Major Hazleton.

922
01:02:40,273 --> 01:02:41,806
Good morning, captain.

923
01:02:41,808 --> 01:02:44,509
We're trying to locate a
soldier Specialist Gibson

924
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:47,412
who was arrested
off base last night.

925
01:02:47,414 --> 01:02:49,114
The AWOL soldier.

926
01:02:49,116 --> 01:02:52,183
Yes, we were told she
was taken to your unit.

927
01:02:53,553 --> 01:02:55,987
She was assigned to mine
when she got back from Iraq.

928
01:02:55,989 --> 01:02:57,422
We know that.

929
01:02:57,424 --> 01:02:58,490
Where is she now?

930
01:03:00,961 --> 01:03:03,428
You're the lawyer I saw
on the news last night.

931
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:07,232
I am Specialist
Gibson's attorney, yes.

932
01:03:07,234 --> 01:03:09,401
You think you're
giving her good advice?

933
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:12,804
Major Hazleton.

934
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:15,607
Can you tell us where
Specialist's Gibson is now?

935
01:03:15,609 --> 01:03:18,576
I tell my soldiers to stay
away from that coffee shop

937
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,714
Did something
happen to my client?

938
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:25,150
She was acting
mentally incoherent

939
01:03:25,152 --> 01:03:26,851
by the end of the interview.

940
01:03:26,853 --> 01:03:29,087
So I had her taken to
the local hospital.

941
01:03:29,089 --> 01:03:30,555
I should have been notified.

942
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:31,790
I did her a favor.

943
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:33,324
She was facing a court martial.

944
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:34,826
I fucking can't
believe this shit.

945
01:03:34,828 --> 01:03:36,895
Don't act like you're not
using her for your own cause.

Can I help you, sir?

I'm Specialist's

What's going on here?

953
01:04:10,931 --> 01:04:12,797
All the beds in the
psychiatric ward are full.

954
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:14,065
We're waiting to hear if the
specialist will be sent

955
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,434
to [indistinct]
General or Walter Reed.

956
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:17,702
Walter Reed?

957
01:04:17,704 --> 01:04:19,237
Whose orders are
you waiting for?

958
01:04:19,239 --> 01:04:21,139
Get them on the phone right now.

He didn't hit you, did he?

No, no, it's just stupid
questions and accusations.

I'm a quitter, shit like that.

965
01:04:46,066 --> 01:04:47,832
What the hell happened Walker?

966
01:04:47,834 --> 01:04:48,833
I'm sorry.

967
01:04:48,835 --> 01:04:50,101
This has never happened before.

968
01:04:50,103 --> 01:04:51,035
Why me?

969
01:04:51,037 --> 01:04:51,870
Did you piss somebody off?

970
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:54,939
I have Captain Marcus on
the line.

01:04:58,011 --> 01:04:59,077
You want anything?

Coffee.

to the cafeteria

975

and get Specialist
Gibson coffee.

I just want some information.

simply for an examination

01:05:13,260 --> 01:05:16,361
and you're talking about sending
them to a psychiatric ward,

980
01:05:16,363 --> 01:05:18,696
please don't tell me to be calm.

981
01:05:18,698 --> 01:05:20,565

to speak to you.

say anything yet,

ain't here tonight.

freaked out, you know?

We're going back soon

1015
01:06:52,092 --> 01:06:55,260
and I probably won't be
here when the baby's born.

1016

Well, you shouldn't
come to me for advice.

talking about bro?

You the one who's always
bringing morale over there.

to you and shit.

bullshit, man.

we started, right?

soldiers to become political.

ones who want a way out.

What about you then?

01:08:54,714 --> 01:08:58,516
Ever since I got back,
I don't think about hope.

bad about this situation.

away at the hospital?

her for a second.

somebody to blame.

1080
01:11:29,135 --> 01:11:30,868
He should go after Hazleton.

1081
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:33,871
I fucking wanted
to kill that guy.

1082
01:11:33,873 --> 01:11:35,206
I know, I did too.

He had no authority to
send her to the hospital.

1085
01:11:43,116 --> 01:11:44,882
The news got down
to the Pentagon,

1086
01:11:46,185 --> 01:11:48,319
Peels flew to
Arlington last night.

1087
01:11:48,321 --> 01:11:50,021
Hazleton I'll take
the brunt of it,

1088
01:11:50,023 --> 01:11:54,592
but he's also going after
you and the Drummer.

1089
01:11:54,594 --> 01:11:58,262
It's Cori Gibson, who
I'm worried about, okay?

1090
01:11:58,264 --> 01:12:01,399
You should be a little
more worried about yourself.

1091
01:12:01,401 --> 01:12:03,935
I've been in more difficult
situations than this.

1092
01:12:03,937 --> 01:12:05,870
Peels is going to be
back in town for the parade

1093
01:12:05,872 --> 01:12:08,606
in two days, make
them look real good

1094
01:12:08,608 --> 01:12:10,174
if Specialist
Gibson was there.

1095
01:12:10,176 --> 01:12:12,543
She was turning
herself in remember.

1096
01:12:14,614 --> 01:12:18,015
Until you tipped Peels off
about the press conference.

1097
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:22,587
That's quite an accusation.

1098
01:12:23,690 --> 01:12:24,589
Who else knew?

1099
01:12:24,591 --> 01:12:26,324
What we had agreed to?

1100
01:12:28,394 --> 01:12:31,162
Why would he have her arrested?

1101
01:12:31,164 --> 01:12:33,764
She's turning herself
in the next day.

1102
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,967
To set an example for
the rest of the unit.

1103
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:43,474
So you knew that
they were going to stop

1104
01:12:43,476 --> 01:12:44,775
the press conference.

1105
01:12:48,181 --> 01:12:49,547
I was only doing my job.

1106
01:12:52,452 --> 01:12:54,952
I hope the army treats
you well for your loyalty.

1107
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:03,661
You got until after
the parade to find her.

1108
01:13:05,965 --> 01:13:07,465
After that, I can't help you.

1109
01:13:11,704 --> 01:13:12,570

Sir, I'm first
Lieutenant Nathaniel Marsh

1116
01:14:10,196 --> 01:14:12,697
and I served with the 10th
Mountain division in Iraq.

1117
01:14:12,699 --> 01:14:14,031
Yes, Lieutenant.

1118
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,433
I wanna know what
you and the army

1119
01:14:15,435 --> 01:14:16,901
are doing about
the many soldiers

1120
01:14:16,903 --> 01:14:18,069
who are coming back from Iraq,

1121
01:14:18,071 --> 01:14:20,071
suffering post traumatic
stress disorder.

1122
01:14:20,073 --> 01:14:21,539
I don't think this
is the appropriate time

1123
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:23,240
to discuss this
issue Lieutenant.

1124
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:24,241
With all due respect, sir.

1125
01:14:24,243 --> 01:14:26,477
When is the appropriate time?

1126
01:14:26,479 --> 01:14:27,712
I'd be glad to meet

1127
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,613
with the committee
of soldiers anytime.

1128
01:14:29,615 --> 01:14:31,749
Could we have a date
and time now, sir?

1129
01:14:33,219 --> 01:14:35,886
Americans have always had
the right to demonstrate

1130
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:39,256
in this country and
soldiers are no exception,

1131
01:14:39,258 --> 01:14:41,492
but the army isn't
going anywhere.

1132
01:14:41,494 --> 01:14:43,360
And there are plenty
of people in America

1133
01:14:43,362 --> 01:14:44,662
who are happy about that.

1134
01:14:44,664 --> 01:14:46,464
Sir, with all due respect,

1135
01:14:46,466 --> 01:14:49,300

we filed your petition.

papers, but I don't care.

we're gonna have
to file a petition.

Go ahead, they can
do what they want.

at the food line.

Yeah you know
what, Christian gone,

1163
01:16:54,927 --> 01:16:57,828
that means there's no active
IVAW member left on base.

1164
01:16:57,830 --> 01:17:00,097
Yeah, that's probably
why they let him go.

Hey, I'll catch up with
you in a little bit, okay.

hill during the parade.

1170

- Oh, buddy,

1176

out of their homes,

1177
01:17:28,861 --> 01:17:30,461
to give us sandwiches
and coffee.

1178

That's nice.

1179

had that little story

in the New York Times.

1181

they weren't gonna to cover
