1
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,810
John Wick, Excommunicado.

2
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,852
In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

3
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:02,511
I do hope that Mr. Wick
finds his way to safety.

4
00:03:02,611 --> 00:03:04,905
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

5
00:03:05,005 --> 00:03:07,174
And killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

6
00:03:07,274 --> 00:03:09,476
Do you expect him
to make it out?

7
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:11,327
$14 million bounty
on his head.

8
00:03:11,427 --> 00:03:14,915
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

9
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:17,716
I'd say the odds
are about even.

10
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:37,943
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

11
00:03:38,043 --> 00:03:39,280
No way!

12
00:03:39,406 --> 00:03:42,261
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

13
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:44,507
But I know better, man.

14
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,380
I know better.
I know what I'm...

15
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:55,656
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

16
00:03:56,128 --> 00:03:57,391
Tick tock.

17
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,390
Tick tock.

18
00:03:59,526 --> 00:04:02,730
Tick tock. Tick...

19
00:04:02,892 --> 00:04:05,199
No time to dilly-dally,
Mr. Wick!

20
00:04:20,016 --> 00:04:21,793
The New York Public Library.

21
00:04:21,893 --> 00:04:22,950
You got it.

22
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:43,771
Change of plan.

23
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:47,875
To the <i>Continental</i>.

24
00:04:48,286 --> 00:04:50,978
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

25
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:53,547
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

26
00:04:54,815 --> 00:04:58,318
Good dog. Good dog.

27
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:10,030
John Wick, Excommunicado.

28
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,366
In effect, 20 minutes.

29
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:34,095
Can I help you?

30
00:05:34,195 --> 00:05:37,224
Russian Folktale.
Alexander Afanasyev.

31
00:05:39,976 --> 00:05:41,201
1864.

32
00:05:51,438 --> 00:05:53,240
- Level two.
- Thank you.

33
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:50,364
"Consider your origins."

34
00:06:50,627 --> 00:06:53,052
"You were not made
to live as brutes,"

35
00:06:53,689 --> 00:06:56,003
"but to follow virtue
and knowledge."

36
00:06:58,981 --> 00:07:00,440
Dante.

37
00:07:02,582 --> 00:07:04,912
Looking a little
run down there, John.

38
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:07,547
Ernest. I still have time.

39
00:07:07,648 --> 00:07:11,051
It's almost up. Who's gonna
know the difference?

40
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,432
You sure this is what
you wanna do?

41
00:07:13,532 --> 00:07:15,055
Fourteen million.
It's a lot of money.

42
00:07:15,155 --> 00:07:16,456
Not if you can't spend it.

43
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,628
Oh, shit.

44
00:08:46,913 --> 00:08:48,048
Push it back.

45
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:04,965
John Wick, Excommunicado.

46
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:07,274
In effect, 10 minutes.

47
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,581
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

48
00:09:21,848 --> 00:09:25,552
No help,
no services of any kind.

49
00:09:36,797 --> 00:09:40,052
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

50
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:42,769
Mr. Wick.

51
00:09:42,869 --> 00:09:45,272
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

52
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,301
I know, Doc, please.
There's still time.

53
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,577
No! I can't.

54
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,477
I still have five minutes!

55
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:52,815
Please.

56
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,854
Come on. Come on.

57
00:10:07,587 --> 00:10:08,728
All right, sit there.

58
00:10:14,134 --> 00:10:15,702
All right, let me see.
Let me see.

59
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:17,704
Uh-huh.

60
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:20,595
Puncture wound.

61
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:24,644
Went deep.
Nicked the artery.

62
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,479
Here you go.

63
00:10:29,349 --> 00:10:30,550
All right.

64
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,056
John Wick, Excommunicado.

65
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:38,358
In effect, one minute.

66
00:10:51,505 --> 00:10:52,539
Doc?

67
00:10:57,044 --> 00:10:58,044
Doc?

68
00:10:58,145 --> 00:11:00,147
Yeah. We're halfway there.

69
00:11:03,148 --> 00:11:04,321
Five seconds.
Yeah.

70
00:11:04,421 --> 00:11:06,796
John Wick, Excommunicado.

71
00:11:06,896 --> 00:11:11,207
In effect, in five, four...

72
00:11:11,624 --> 00:11:14,227
Three, two...

73
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:15,935
One.

74
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,007
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

75
00:11:27,107 --> 00:11:28,708
I know. Rules.

76
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,677
Ah, rules.

77
00:11:36,881 --> 00:11:38,385
John Wick, 14 million.

78
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:41,043
Open contract
is now in effect.

79
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:43,456
All services are suspended.

80
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,889
And away we go.

81
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:42,803
Top shelf. On the right.

82
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:45,218
Yeah. Take four.

83
00:12:45,318 --> 00:12:48,388
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

84
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,399
Mr. Wick?

85
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:03,370
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

86
00:13:03,703 --> 00:13:04,703
But you did.

87
00:13:04,803 --> 00:13:05,905
They'll know.

88
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:07,474
Know what?

89
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:09,943
I told you
where the medicine was.

90
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:28,393
Where?
Here.

91
00:13:28,561 --> 00:13:29,788
Just below my floating rib.

92
00:13:29,888 --> 00:13:31,725
Be sure not to hit
my large intestine.

93
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:35,179
Oh, wait!

94
00:13:35,669 --> 00:13:37,359
One may not be enough.

95
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,576
Yeah. All right.

96
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,146
Be sure not to graze my...

97
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:48,648
Oh!

98
00:13:55,586 --> 00:13:57,251
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

99
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:01,440
Thanks, Doc.

100
00:23:39,372 --> 00:23:41,874
John Wick. Open contract.

101
00:23:41,974 --> 00:23:44,577
Increase, 15 million.

102
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:49,448
Where are you going,
Jonathan?

103
00:23:58,591 --> 00:23:59,891
We are closed.

104
00:25:57,087 --> 00:26:01,647
Jardani.
Why have you come home?

105
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:09,360
You present this to me
like an answer.

106
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,883
I still have my ticket.

107
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:16,262
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

108
00:26:16,362 --> 00:26:18,731
you think
your ticket is valid?

109
00:26:19,012 --> 00:26:20,866
You forget
that the Ruska Roma

110
00:26:20,966 --> 00:26:22,589
is bound by the High Table,

111
00:26:22,935 --> 00:26:25,700
and the High Table
stands above all?

112
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:28,607
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

113
00:26:29,938 --> 00:26:34,837
You honor me by bringing death
to my front door.

114
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,320
Oh, Jardani,
what has become of you?

115
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:01,148
You are bound...

116
00:27:01,393 --> 00:27:03,793
And I am owed.

117
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,249
Rooney, enough!

118
00:27:41,471 --> 00:27:44,316
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

119
00:27:44,416 --> 00:27:46,685
You know, when my pupils
first come here,

120
00:27:46,785 --> 00:27:48,220
they wish for one thing.

121
00:27:48,526 --> 00:27:50,559
A life free of suffering.

122
00:27:50,756 --> 00:27:53,717
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

123
00:27:53,817 --> 00:27:55,828
but as you know,

124
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:58,297
art is pain.

125
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,298
Life is suffering.

126
00:28:08,474 --> 00:28:10,943
Somehow,
you managed to get out.

127
00:28:11,995 --> 00:28:14,150
But here you are,
back where you began.

128
00:28:15,375 --> 00:28:17,249
All of this, for what?

129
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:55,354
<i>Pirouette.</i>

130
00:28:57,266 --> 00:28:59,525
<i>Pirouette, pirouette.</i>

131
00:29:02,606 --> 00:29:03,696
Sit.

132
00:29:17,403 --> 00:29:19,302
Even if I wanted to,

133
00:29:20,024 --> 00:29:21,885
I can't help you, Jardani.

134
00:29:23,146 --> 00:29:25,582
The High Table
wants your life.

135
00:29:26,183 --> 00:29:27,986
How can you fight the wind?

136
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,587
How can you smash
the mountains?

137
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:32,640
How can you bury the ocean?

138
00:29:33,290 --> 00:29:36,021
How can you escape
from the light?

139
00:29:36,168 --> 00:29:38,495
Of course,
you can go to the dark.

140
00:29:38,789 --> 00:29:40,774
But they're in the dark, too.

141
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,889
So tell me, Jardani.

142
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:48,073
What do you really want?

143
00:29:50,974 --> 00:29:52,376
Passage.

144
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,045
Where did you want to go?

145
00:29:56,746 --> 00:29:58,485
Casablanca.

146
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:03,787
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

147
00:30:08,995 --> 00:30:10,171
So be it.

148
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:14,531
You hand me your ticket,
I will tear it.

149
00:30:15,432 --> 00:30:17,801
If that's what
you really desire.

150
00:30:57,132 --> 00:31:00,777
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

151
00:31:10,287 --> 00:31:12,296
You can never come home again.

152
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,059
Take him to the lifeboat.

153
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:18,962
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

154
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,590
<i>Do svidanya.</i>

155
00:31:54,702 --> 00:31:57,734
Welcome to the <i>Continental</i>.
How may I help you?

156
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,039
Sir.

157
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,790
There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

158
00:32:22,392 --> 00:32:23,760
Very well, sir.

159
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,729
The manager is in the lounge.

160
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:36,911
I presume you're
here to discuss John Wick.

161
00:32:37,597 --> 00:32:39,876
If that's so,
we can make this short.

162
00:32:40,316 --> 00:32:43,547
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

163
00:32:43,647 --> 00:32:45,215
And that's the all of it.

164
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,417
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

165
00:32:47,517 --> 00:32:49,135
Oh, yes.

166
00:32:49,786 --> 00:32:51,830
And I haven't got the
slightest idea where he is...

167
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,189
You're mistaken.

168
00:32:53,373 --> 00:32:54,843
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

169
00:32:55,088 --> 00:32:57,561
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

170
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:58,929
Hmm.
The blood was spilt

171
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:01,335
on the grounds of
the <i>Continental</i>. Was it not?

172
00:33:01,435 --> 00:33:02,482
Oh, yes.

173
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,768
As a matter of fact,
the body gets colder

174
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,736
within these very walls.

175
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:08,807
I'd like to see it.

176
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,477
Santino D'Antonio.

177
00:33:39,903 --> 00:33:41,952
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

178
00:33:42,052 --> 00:33:43,052
slain by Mr. Wick

179
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:46,242
while seeking sanctuary
in the <i>Continental</i>.

180
00:33:50,207 --> 00:33:53,025
With a .45 ACP,
it appears.

181
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:56,786
I had no control
over Mr. Wick's actions.

182
00:33:56,886 --> 00:33:59,956
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

183
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,496
Yes.

184
00:34:01,725 --> 00:34:03,793
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

185
00:34:03,893 --> 00:34:06,329
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

186
00:34:07,282 --> 00:34:09,566
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

187
00:34:09,666 --> 00:34:11,267
you stood by
and let him walk away

188
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:13,837
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

189
00:34:13,937 --> 00:34:15,905
I made him Excommunicado.

190
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:18,842
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

191
00:34:18,992 --> 00:34:20,610
He broke the rules
in my hotel.

192
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,213
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

193
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,896
Where is your fealty?

194
00:34:25,704 --> 00:34:27,751
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

195
00:34:27,851 --> 00:34:30,112
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

196
00:34:30,212 --> 00:34:31,876
Everything is under the Table.

197
00:34:31,976 --> 00:34:33,490
I understand
that you have your loyalties,

198
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,858
but this cannot be overlooked.

199
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:38,294
Let me be clear.
I am here to adjudge you.

200
00:34:38,565 --> 00:34:40,330
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

201
00:34:41,866 --> 00:34:42,866
Excuse me?

202
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:46,002
At such time,
your successor will be named.

203
00:34:47,629 --> 00:34:49,039
There are rules,

204
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:50,692
they are the only things
that separate us...

205
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:53,190
- From the animals.
- Yes.

206
00:34:53,443 --> 00:34:55,311
You have seven days.

207
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:02,052
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

208
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:04,921
you may look for me
in room 217.

209
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:08,224
Enjoy your stay
at the <i>Continental</i>.

210
00:35:21,104 --> 00:35:23,323
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

211
00:35:37,654 --> 00:35:40,857
Welcome to my Mission Control.

212
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:44,227
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

213
00:35:44,327 --> 00:35:46,399
From whence I control
the word on the street,

214
00:35:46,571 --> 00:35:47,967
the way of the world.

215
00:35:48,163 --> 00:35:49,199
With pigeons.

216
00:35:49,299 --> 00:35:53,470
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

217
00:35:54,738 --> 00:35:58,341
No IP addresses.
No digital footprint.

218
00:35:58,648 --> 00:36:02,298
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

219
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:04,948
Can you get disease from it?

220
00:36:05,115 --> 00:36:07,751
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

221
00:36:08,447 --> 00:36:09,770
What the hell do you want?

222
00:36:10,687 --> 00:36:12,489
I wanted to see
where it didn't happen.

223
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,124
Where what didn't happen?

224
00:36:14,224 --> 00:36:16,259
Where you didn't kill
John Wick.

225
00:36:17,192 --> 00:36:18,323
I've always been
under the impression

226
00:36:18,423 --> 00:36:21,498
that contracts and executing
them was optional.

227
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,833
I have no problem
with John Wick.

228
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,143
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

229
00:36:33,243 --> 00:36:34,878
knowing that
he intended to use it

230
00:36:34,978 --> 00:36:37,046
to stand against the Table.
Yes?

231
00:36:41,217 --> 00:36:44,066
This Kimber 1911,
to be exact.

232
00:36:51,594 --> 00:36:53,129
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

233
00:36:53,229 --> 00:36:55,654
the High Table
is giving you seven days.

234
00:36:56,217 --> 00:36:58,153
Seven days for what, exactly?

235
00:36:58,253 --> 00:36:59,598
To settle your affairs

236
00:36:59,698 --> 00:37:01,974
and find a new home
for your birds.

237
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,941
In seven days,
you abdicate your throne.

238
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,188
Oh, my dear.

239
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:21,031
Tell me, do you know what
the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

240
00:37:21,131 --> 00:37:23,140
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

241
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,962
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

242
00:37:27,062 --> 00:37:29,666
Because I am the throne, baby.

243
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:32,101
I am the Bowery!

244
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:35,205
I am all that you deign
not to look at

245
00:37:35,305 --> 00:37:36,806
when you walk
down the street at night.

246
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:41,044
The Bowery is mine.
Mine alone.

247
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,346
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

248
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:46,437
you exist outside
the rules, no men do.

249
00:37:47,016 --> 00:37:48,960
You have seven days.

250
00:39:28,851 --> 00:39:30,233
Enough!

251
00:39:35,818 --> 00:39:38,761
I'm afraid our friend here
is off limits.

252
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:41,061
But he's Excommunicado.

253
00:39:41,673 --> 00:39:44,567
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

254
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,170
Mr. Jonathan,

255
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:49,807
would you be so kind
as to come with me?

256
00:40:10,159 --> 00:40:12,957
Welcome to Casablanca,
Mr. Wick.

257
00:40:13,447 --> 00:40:14,573
Thanks.

258
00:40:20,169 --> 00:40:21,371
Mr. Jonathan,

259
00:40:21,471 --> 00:40:23,239
it has been a long time
since our fine city

260
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,375
has been graced
with your presence.

261
00:40:25,842 --> 00:40:26,945
I need to talk to...

262
00:40:27,045 --> 00:40:28,856
Yes, Miss Al-Azwar,
she's expecting you.

263
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,989
My, my, welcome
to the Moroccan <i>Continental</i>.

264
00:40:40,149 --> 00:40:42,158
I hope you'll find it
to your taste.

265
00:40:43,824 --> 00:40:45,000
Right this way.

266
00:40:45,293 --> 00:40:47,792
Miss Al-Azwar,
she waits for no man.

267
00:40:51,981 --> 00:40:56,881
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

268
00:41:31,569 --> 00:41:33,407
You a dog person, John?

269
00:41:34,313 --> 00:41:35,478
Sofia?

270
00:41:41,319 --> 00:41:42,485
Sofia!

271
00:41:42,585 --> 00:41:45,154
You can't kill the bearer
of your marker.

272
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:48,130
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

273
00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:50,383
Nice suit.

274
00:41:53,129 --> 00:41:54,564
Good to see you, too.

275
00:41:54,664 --> 00:41:57,145
I should shoot you
in the head right now.

276
00:41:57,245 --> 00:41:58,467
I know.

277
00:42:03,808 --> 00:42:05,645
Don't you do it.

278
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,320
You're Excommunicado, John.

279
00:42:09,736 --> 00:42:14,464
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

280
00:42:19,413 --> 00:42:21,250
This is your blood.

281
00:42:22,524 --> 00:42:24,117
Your bond.

282
00:42:24,729 --> 00:42:29,383
When you needed help,
I was there.

283
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,674
Sit.

284
00:42:42,343 --> 00:42:44,400
I was talking to you, John.

285
00:42:49,318 --> 00:42:52,876
You do realize that
I'm management now, right?

286
00:42:54,056 --> 00:42:55,725
I'm not service anymore, John.

287
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:59,001
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

288
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:01,941
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

289
00:43:02,235 --> 00:43:04,415
I just need you
to get me to him.

290
00:43:04,567 --> 00:43:07,436
To who?
Your old boss.

291
00:43:09,265 --> 00:43:10,606
You want to kill Berrada.

292
00:43:10,706 --> 00:43:12,675
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

293
00:43:12,775 --> 00:43:15,578
What could he
possibly give to you?

294
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:19,383
Guidance.

295
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:24,209
Look, I made a deal when
I agreed to run this hotel.

296
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:25,488
And that deal said

297
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:28,079
that I had to follow
the rules of the Table.

298
00:43:28,457 --> 00:43:31,594
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

299
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:34,914
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

300
00:43:35,431 --> 00:43:39,402
If I make one mistake,
one enemy...

301
00:43:40,503 --> 00:43:43,929
Maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

302
00:43:45,508 --> 00:43:48,711
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

303
00:43:49,712 --> 00:43:53,900
But that's not a chance
I can take. Sorry.

304
00:43:56,152 --> 00:43:58,358
Do you wanna know
where she is?

305
00:43:59,191 --> 00:44:02,205
No. I don't ever wanna know.

306
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:05,494
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

307
00:44:06,639 --> 00:44:09,823
A part of me longs for her.

308
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:14,600
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

309
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:16,364
just to keep her safe.

310
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:26,115
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

311
00:44:26,682 --> 00:44:29,352
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

312
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:31,320
That's why
I'm sitting here right now

313
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:33,463
and that's why I'm fucked!

314
00:44:39,073 --> 00:44:41,180
- Consequences.
- Yeah.

315
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:44,610
Consequences.

316
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:49,460
I'm just asking you to try.

317
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:52,041
Either way, you and me,

318
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:54,213
we'll be even.

319
00:45:05,114 --> 00:45:06,290
No.

320
00:45:07,686 --> 00:45:13,562
After this,
we are less than even.

321
00:45:17,241 --> 00:45:19,053
We leave in 10 minutes.

322
00:46:16,059 --> 00:46:17,626
How can I help you?

323
00:46:29,827 --> 00:46:32,475
I wasn't expecting
the High Table so soon.

324
00:46:34,643 --> 00:46:36,294
There is a task.

325
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:38,768
It involves someone
who broke the rules

326
00:46:38,868 --> 00:46:40,383
and stood against the Table.

327
00:46:41,855 --> 00:46:43,594
John Wick, you mean.

328
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:46,093
My students
have not been idle.

329
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,959
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

330
00:46:49,592 --> 00:46:51,594
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

331
00:46:51,694 --> 00:46:54,153
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

332
00:46:54,253 --> 00:46:56,749
A dog, a car.

333
00:46:57,754 --> 00:46:59,001
I'm familiar.

334
00:47:02,237 --> 00:47:03,707
And I'm interested.

335
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:06,426
Very.

336
00:47:12,967 --> 00:47:16,018
Blowfish. Very fatal.

337
00:47:20,732 --> 00:47:22,024
No soy.

338
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,930
I have served,

339
00:47:32,467 --> 00:47:34,202
I will be of service.

340
00:49:15,337 --> 00:49:16,508
Stop!

341
00:49:23,416 --> 00:49:24,739
Out!

342
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,464
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

343
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:37,577
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

344
00:49:37,677 --> 00:49:38,677
He had a ticket.

345
00:49:38,777 --> 00:49:41,275
But a ticket does not stand
above the Table.

346
00:49:41,497 --> 00:49:44,567
Your penance
will be paid in blood.

347
00:49:45,101 --> 00:49:46,101
Now...

348
00:49:48,771 --> 00:49:53,327
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

349
00:50:01,517 --> 00:50:03,494
I have served,

350
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:06,923
I will be of service.

351
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,880
We're not going in
like the old days.

352
00:50:32,648 --> 00:50:34,655
It's just a conversation.

353
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:39,154
Nothing's ever just
a conversation with you, John.

354
00:50:43,058 --> 00:50:44,233
Let's go.

355
00:51:08,484 --> 00:51:10,252
Sofia.

356
00:51:10,352 --> 00:51:12,528
Always so nice to see you.

357
00:51:13,067 --> 00:51:17,109
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

358
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:18,727
Certainly.

359
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:24,581
Fantastic.

360
00:51:25,585 --> 00:51:27,129
Jonathan Wick.

361
00:51:28,203 --> 00:51:31,674
I had heard you had
made your way to our shores.

362
00:51:37,197 --> 00:51:38,593
Come along now.

363
00:51:38,863 --> 00:51:41,150
I am certain
we have much to discuss.

364
00:51:45,526 --> 00:51:50,159
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

365
00:51:51,728 --> 00:51:52,728
Tell me.

366
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:54,835
Do you come here to kill me?

367
00:51:56,991 --> 00:51:57,991
No.

368
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:11,947
Mr. Wick, do you know where the
word "assassin" comes from?

369
00:52:13,257 --> 00:52:16,985
People argue. "Assassin."

370
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:22,124
Hashasheen,
followers of Hassan-i...

371
00:52:23,192 --> 00:52:25,923
Eaters of hashish.

372
00:52:27,529 --> 00:52:28,715
No, thank you.

373
00:52:30,332 --> 00:52:33,419
But others contend
it comes from asasiyyun.

374
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:36,105
Meaning, "men who are faithful"

375
00:52:36,205 --> 00:52:38,098
"and who abide
by their beliefs."

376
00:52:39,975 --> 00:52:41,748
You see that coin?

377
00:52:42,277 --> 00:52:45,848
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

378
00:52:45,948 --> 00:52:49,024
Next to it, the first marker.

379
00:52:49,318 --> 00:52:51,645
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

380
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,255
Now, this coin, of course,

381
00:52:53,355 --> 00:52:56,202
it does not represent
monetary value.

382
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:59,705
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

383
00:52:59,999 --> 00:53:03,298
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

384
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:06,168
Order and rules.

385
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,720
You have broken the rules.

386
00:53:08,971 --> 00:53:11,758
The High Table
has marked you for death.

387
00:53:12,198 --> 00:53:14,009
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

388
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:18,004
when your life has been
by your own actions, forfeit?

389
00:53:23,418 --> 00:53:25,320
I seek to make amends.

390
00:53:25,991 --> 00:53:28,223
To pay for what I've done.

391
00:53:28,323 --> 00:53:32,261
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

392
00:53:36,524 --> 00:53:40,235
This dog,
I do so love it.

393
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:43,472
Tell me, does it shed
a great deal?

394
00:53:46,201 --> 00:53:47,597
Occasionally.

395
00:53:48,277 --> 00:53:51,076
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

396
00:53:51,713 --> 00:53:53,015
And if he wants me dead...

397
00:53:53,115 --> 00:53:56,294
Then he will see to it that your
bones bleach under the sun.

398
00:53:57,494 --> 00:53:58,793
I see.

399
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:01,557
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

400
00:54:08,864 --> 00:54:10,429
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

401
00:54:11,629 --> 00:54:14,169
I cannot tell you
where to find the Elder.

402
00:54:16,905 --> 00:54:18,587
You fail to understand.

403
00:54:18,783 --> 00:54:20,843
The Elder
is not a man you find.

404
00:54:20,943 --> 00:54:23,045
He can only choose
to find you.

405
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:24,736
You wish to speak with him?

406
00:54:25,348 --> 00:54:27,969
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

407
00:54:28,704 --> 00:54:30,101
Canis Minor,

408
00:54:30,285 --> 00:54:33,310
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

409
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:35,490
You follow the brightest star.

410
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:38,185
Walk until
you are almost dead.

411
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,561
Then, keep walking.

412
00:54:40,996 --> 00:54:42,815
When you are
on your last breath,

413
00:54:43,065 --> 00:54:44,383
he will find you...

414
00:54:45,656 --> 00:54:46,954
Or he will not.

415
00:54:48,937 --> 00:54:50,385
I am grateful.

416
00:54:53,075 --> 00:54:54,610
Thank you, sir.

417
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:59,424
Perhaps you were
not listening before.

418
00:55:03,418 --> 00:55:05,181
The social contract.

419
00:55:06,455 --> 00:55:07,998
The commerce of relationships.

420
00:55:09,358 --> 00:55:11,281
You have received
a great gift.

421
00:55:11,452 --> 00:55:13,161
I have hosted your friend.

422
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,131
What do you offer in return?

423
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:23,162
So soft and yet so fierce.

424
00:55:23,824 --> 00:55:26,141
I love it, this dog.

425
00:55:27,476 --> 00:55:28,527
I will keep it.

426
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:29,845
Excuse me?

427
00:55:29,945 --> 00:55:31,565
This will be my gift.

428
00:55:31,747 --> 00:55:34,349
This will be how
you show me your fealty.

429
00:55:34,578 --> 00:55:35,617
No.

430
00:55:35,950 --> 00:55:37,886
Surely it's the least
you can do.

431
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:40,155
No, you cannot keep my dog.

432
00:55:41,190 --> 00:55:42,466
Very well.

433
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:44,965
Very well.

434
00:55:47,496 --> 00:55:48,797
Then I will kill it.

435
00:55:54,054 --> 00:55:55,838
I'm sorry, Sofia.

436
00:55:55,938 --> 00:55:58,240
This was for you to learn.

437
00:56:06,748 --> 00:56:08,017
Don't.

438
00:56:49,558 --> 00:56:51,696
Sofia. Don't.

439
00:56:56,694 --> 00:56:58,482
He shot my dog.

440
00:56:59,907 --> 00:57:00,907
I get it.

441
00:57:03,382 --> 00:57:04,446
We gotta go.

442
00:57:04,959 --> 00:57:05,959
Now.

443
01:03:41,369 --> 01:03:42,937
Here you go.

444
01:03:47,375 --> 01:03:49,452
You're gonna die, John.

445
01:03:50,211 --> 01:03:52,809
Whether out here
in this desert,

446
01:03:53,372 --> 01:03:56,483
or somewhere else
down the road.

447
01:03:57,831 --> 01:03:59,587
But you are gonna die.

448
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:16,671
Consequences.

449
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,976
Consequences.

450
01:04:48,688 --> 01:04:50,500
Better get going.

451
01:04:59,515 --> 01:05:01,049
Sofia.

452
01:07:42,176 --> 01:07:43,747
Okay.

453
01:07:49,283 --> 01:07:50,778
You made your point.

454
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,222
You have earned my fealty.

455
01:07:55,491 --> 01:07:56,491
Matter of fact...

456
01:07:56,591 --> 01:07:58,316
I'm gonna shove so much
fealty up your ass

457
01:07:58,416 --> 01:08:00,228
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

458
01:08:00,503 --> 01:08:02,022
You had your chance.

459
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:05,011
Well, since you see it
that way,

460
01:08:05,567 --> 01:08:07,402
I guess it's time I told you

461
01:08:07,656 --> 01:08:11,639
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

462
01:08:12,066 --> 01:08:13,462
Duly noted.

463
01:08:13,741 --> 01:08:15,376
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

464
01:08:15,476 --> 01:08:19,047
your penance will be paid
with seven cuts.

465
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:22,116
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

466
01:08:25,809 --> 01:08:27,818
Avert your eyes,
my sweet.

467
01:08:29,116 --> 01:08:31,993
The king is dead.

468
01:08:36,809 --> 01:08:38,768
Long live the king.

469
01:09:32,620 --> 01:09:33,814
Drink.

470
01:09:35,455 --> 01:09:37,636
Don't worry,
your weapon is still there.

471
01:09:38,542 --> 01:09:39,717
Please drink.

472
01:09:49,904 --> 01:09:53,363
My son, how have you
come to be so lost?

473
01:09:54,142 --> 01:09:55,677
Not lost.

474
01:09:56,544 --> 01:09:57,879
Looking for you.

475
01:09:58,165 --> 01:10:00,051
You think
I speak of your location?

476
01:10:02,207 --> 01:10:03,993
Never seen a man fight so hard

477
01:10:04,093 --> 01:10:06,004
to end up
back where he started.

478
01:10:13,861 --> 01:10:15,797
So tell me, Jonathan.

479
01:10:16,097 --> 01:10:17,763
Why do you wish to live?

480
01:10:18,566 --> 01:10:21,682
My wife, Helen.

481
01:10:24,230 --> 01:10:25,969
To remember her.

482
01:10:27,268 --> 01:10:28,933
To remember us.

483
01:10:29,497 --> 01:10:32,246
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

484
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,940
At least a chance to earn it.

485
01:10:37,581 --> 01:10:40,840
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

486
01:10:41,967 --> 01:10:44,125
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

487
01:10:45,727 --> 01:10:47,295
Complete a task for us,

488
01:10:47,395 --> 01:10:49,630
and your Excommunicado
will be reversed.

489
01:10:49,731 --> 01:10:51,667
The open contract closed,

490
01:10:52,035 --> 01:10:53,868
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

491
01:10:53,968 --> 01:10:57,131
Not free under the Table,
but bound to it.

492
01:10:57,327 --> 01:11:00,341
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

493
01:11:04,545 --> 01:11:06,214
The choice is yours.

494
01:11:08,249 --> 01:11:10,065
Die here and now.

495
01:11:10,506 --> 01:11:13,397
Or continue to live
and remember through death.

496
01:11:30,864 --> 01:11:32,774
What must be done?

497
01:11:32,874 --> 01:11:35,810
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

498
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:38,913
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

499
01:11:39,814 --> 01:11:40,848
What?

500
01:11:40,948 --> 01:11:43,161
He has forgotten his fealty.

501
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,087
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

502
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:49,056
will be lifted
until you complete your task.

503
01:11:49,724 --> 01:11:51,270
So if you wish to live,

504
01:11:51,686 --> 01:11:53,230
and if you wish to remember,

505
01:11:54,430 --> 01:11:56,297
this is the choice
you must make.

506
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,934
I will serve.

507
01:12:17,237 --> 01:12:19,785
I will be of service.

508
01:12:20,348 --> 01:12:22,137
Very well, my son.

509
01:12:22,308 --> 01:12:24,192
Cast aside your weakness

510
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,281
and reaffirm your fealty
to the table.

511
01:12:33,381 --> 01:12:34,900
Mr. John Wick.

512
01:13:22,597 --> 01:13:23,895
Thank you.

513
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:29,187
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

514
01:13:46,482 --> 01:13:48,932
I wish you good luck
on your path.

515
01:13:49,397 --> 01:13:52,141
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

516
01:13:53,978 --> 01:13:55,249
And Mr. Wick.

517
01:14:34,668 --> 01:14:37,892
<i>JFK Express</i>
<i>now arriving on platform nine.</i>

518
01:14:37,992 --> 01:14:41,195
<i>JFK Express now arriving</i>
<i>on platform nine.</i>

519
01:16:03,878 --> 01:16:05,279
Stick together, kids.

520
01:16:05,379 --> 01:16:06,570
Make sure
you're holding the hand

521
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:09,400
of the person
in front and behind you.

522
01:16:12,242 --> 01:16:15,476
You see? That's why
you're special, John Wick.

523
01:16:18,726 --> 01:16:20,351
I wouldn't have stopped.

524
01:16:22,041 --> 01:16:23,597
It's good to have you back.

525
01:16:30,538 --> 01:16:32,257
How was your trip?

526
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:37,144
Going to the <i>Continental</i>?

527
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:44,334
He with you?

528
01:16:44,885 --> 01:16:46,955
He was.

529
01:16:57,366 --> 01:16:58,665
Nice trick.

530
01:20:06,536 --> 01:20:09,550
Sir! Put your weapon down.

531
01:20:10,624 --> 01:20:12,783
He's Excommunicado.

532
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:15,829
Unless you wish
to become the same,

533
01:20:16,630 --> 01:20:19,967
I suggest you lower your gun.

534
01:20:26,036 --> 01:20:27,972
I'd like to see the manager.

535
01:20:30,569 --> 01:20:32,038
Of course.

536
01:20:32,773 --> 01:20:35,516
If you would be so kind
as to follow me.

537
01:20:48,395 --> 01:20:49,797
Please take a seat.

538
01:20:49,995 --> 01:20:51,979
I will let him know
you have arrived.

539
01:21:26,937 --> 01:21:28,382
I gotta tell you,

540
01:21:28,602 --> 01:21:31,572
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

541
01:21:31,788 --> 01:21:35,463
I'm a huge fan.
John Wick.

542
01:21:36,944 --> 01:21:39,456
And so far,
you haven't disappointed.

543
01:21:43,718 --> 01:21:45,654
Is that the dog?

544
01:21:45,754 --> 01:21:47,368
He likes you.

545
01:21:48,054 --> 01:21:52,526
Me? I'm more of
a cat person myself.

546
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:54,448
Hey, dog.

547
01:21:57,632 --> 01:22:01,568
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

548
01:22:01,797 --> 01:22:03,610
We're not the same.

549
01:22:04,037 --> 01:22:05,423
Yes, we are.

550
01:22:06,206 --> 01:22:07,848
No, we're not.

551
01:22:08,975 --> 01:22:11,180
The manager
is ready for you now.

552
01:22:11,302 --> 01:22:13,414
In the administrative lounge, sir.

553
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,229
Mr. Wick.

554
01:22:31,366 --> 01:22:32,468
Sit.

555
01:22:33,791 --> 01:22:34,942
Stay.

556
01:22:36,657 --> 01:22:37,838
Good dog.

557
01:23:33,859 --> 01:23:36,263
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

558
01:23:44,711 --> 01:23:47,975
We only use this room
on special occasions.

559
01:23:48,313 --> 01:23:52,110
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

560
01:23:52,312 --> 01:23:53,914
under the table.

561
01:23:55,907 --> 01:23:58,051
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

562
01:23:59,152 --> 01:24:00,194
Yeah.

563
01:24:00,414 --> 01:24:01,737
Well, of course.

564
01:24:02,595 --> 01:24:07,060
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

565
01:24:08,195 --> 01:24:09,930
Isn't that why you're here?

566
01:24:10,189 --> 01:24:12,000
I have served,

567
01:24:12,810 --> 01:24:14,842
I will be of service.

568
01:24:16,852 --> 01:24:18,346
But you're having doubts.

569
01:24:19,767 --> 01:24:22,609
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

570
01:24:23,577 --> 01:24:25,230
If you feel you must,

571
01:24:28,072 --> 01:24:30,105
put a bullet through my heart.

572
01:24:36,965 --> 01:24:39,326
The High Table has asked me
to step down.

573
01:24:39,733 --> 01:24:40,961
The hour?

574
01:24:41,563 --> 01:24:42,563
The hour.

575
01:24:42,663 --> 01:24:45,165
You should have killed me
in the <i>Continental</i>.

576
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,013
Maybe I should have.

577
01:24:48,821 --> 01:24:50,977
Rules and consequences.

578
01:24:51,371 --> 01:24:52,569
Hmm.

579
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,209
It seems like everyone
is suffering

580
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:56,440
from the consequences
of their actions.

581
01:24:57,052 --> 01:24:59,061
And you're not stepping down?

582
01:25:01,214 --> 01:25:02,540
No.

583
01:25:03,618 --> 01:25:05,039
I don't think I am.

584
01:25:05,485 --> 01:25:06,950
So it's war?

585
01:25:07,487 --> 01:25:09,856
You're going to war
with the High Table?

586
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:11,433
Skirmish.

587
01:25:11,758 --> 01:25:12,811
Unless you decide to shoot me.

588
01:25:12,911 --> 01:25:17,163
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

589
01:25:17,263 --> 01:25:18,904
than that of an enemy.

590
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,869
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

591
01:25:24,471 --> 01:25:26,156
What choice?

592
01:25:26,964 --> 01:25:29,536
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

593
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:33,211
But I'll be alive.
And I can remember her.

594
01:25:33,311 --> 01:25:36,298
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

595
01:25:36,494 --> 01:25:40,805
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

596
01:25:41,246 --> 01:25:44,429
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

597
01:25:44,529 --> 01:25:48,669
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

598
01:25:49,355 --> 01:25:50,731
The Baba Yaga?

599
01:25:51,069 --> 01:25:52,929
The last thing
many men ever see?

600
01:25:53,029 --> 01:25:57,684
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

601
01:25:58,076 --> 01:26:00,841
Who do you wish
to die as, Jonathan?

602
01:26:32,839 --> 01:26:35,642
Mr. Wick,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

603
01:26:35,742 --> 01:26:37,678
I am an Adjudicator.

604
01:26:39,036 --> 01:26:40,914
Have you decided to step down?

605
01:26:43,417 --> 01:26:45,258
I think not.

606
01:26:46,336 --> 01:26:49,356
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

607
01:26:52,803 --> 01:26:55,988
No, I don't think I will.

608
01:27:03,656 --> 01:27:05,072
Very well.

609
01:27:13,357 --> 01:27:14,630
Administration.

610
01:27:15,071 --> 01:27:17,050
<i>I'd like to</i>
<i>change a designation.</i>

611
01:27:17,684 --> 01:27:18,785
Verification?

612
01:27:18,885 --> 01:27:22,272
<i>Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.</i>

613
01:27:22,372 --> 01:27:24,160
The <i>Continental</i> Hotel,
New York.

614
01:27:24,405 --> 01:27:26,193
New designation?

615
01:27:26,293 --> 01:27:27,861
Deconsecrated.

616
01:27:30,732 --> 01:27:31,732
Processing.

617
01:27:33,959 --> 01:27:35,235
Administrator.

618
01:27:36,434 --> 01:27:40,549
File. The New York
<i>Continental</i> Hotel.

619
01:27:51,084 --> 01:27:55,822
The New York <i>Continental</i> Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

620
01:28:02,964 --> 01:28:05,339
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

621
01:28:05,439 --> 01:28:08,207
Business may now be conducted
on <i>Continental</i> grounds.

622
01:28:08,403 --> 01:28:10,483
Since you are refusing
to step down

623
01:28:10,583 --> 01:28:14,808
and you are refusing a direct
order, your lives are now forfeit.

624
01:28:14,908 --> 01:28:16,943
High Table emissaries will be
joining you presently

625
01:28:17,043 --> 01:28:19,980
to see the removal of
your souls from the property.

626
01:28:21,093 --> 01:28:23,183
Good evening, gentlemen.

627
01:28:27,388 --> 01:28:30,457
This haven is safe no more.

628
01:28:33,194 --> 01:28:36,062
Are services
still off limits to me?

629
01:28:36,730 --> 01:28:37,898
Under the circumstances,

630
01:28:37,998 --> 01:28:40,174
your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

631
01:28:40,274 --> 01:28:41,601
What do you need?

632
01:28:42,209 --> 01:28:45,173
Guns.
Lots of guns.

633
01:29:03,596 --> 01:29:05,776
Let's make a withdrawal.

634
01:29:29,749 --> 01:29:30,984
Remember, sir.

635
01:29:31,084 --> 01:29:33,628
These will be
High Table forces.

636
01:29:33,728 --> 01:29:36,323
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

637
01:29:36,790 --> 01:29:37,794
Why?

638
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:40,440
Much has changed
during your time away.

639
01:29:40,627 --> 01:29:41,661
Like what?

640
01:29:41,934 --> 01:29:44,865
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

641
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,343
May I suggest
the 2011 Combat Master

642
01:29:56,443 --> 01:29:59,079
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

643
01:30:10,323 --> 01:30:12,211
<i>Attention, all guests.</i>

644
01:30:12,311 --> 01:30:15,567
<i>The</i>Continental <i>Hotel</i>
<i>is closing for fumigation.</i>

645
01:30:15,667 --> 01:30:17,358
<i>We apologize</i>
<i>for the inconvenience.</i>

646
01:30:17,480 --> 01:30:19,532
<i>Please make your way</i>
<i>to the nearest exit.</i>

647
01:30:24,364 --> 01:30:26,840
<i>Attention, all guests.</i>
<i>The</i> Continental <i>Hotel...</i>

648
01:30:26,940 --> 01:30:30,415
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

649
01:30:30,515 --> 01:30:32,145
Your transaction
may now be conducted

650
01:30:32,245 --> 01:30:34,147
on <i>Continental</i> grounds.

651
01:30:39,602 --> 01:30:42,889
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

652
01:30:43,031 --> 01:30:46,126
Cool. Very cool.

653
01:30:50,797 --> 01:30:55,451
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second.

654
01:30:55,574 --> 01:30:57,485
Serious business.

655
01:31:01,086 --> 01:31:02,275
Thank you.

656
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:03,805
Let us begin.

657
01:32:50,345 --> 01:32:53,253
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

658
01:32:54,142 --> 01:32:55,655
Of course, sir.

659
01:33:16,998 --> 01:33:19,646
I know you'll do
the <i>Continental</i> proud.

660
01:33:19,987 --> 01:33:21,414
I'll see you soon, sir.

661
01:33:24,347 --> 01:33:27,787
And you, Jonathan,
do what you do best.

662
01:33:28,071 --> 01:33:29,222
What's that?

663
01:33:29,933 --> 01:33:31,357
Hunt.

664
01:37:04,923 --> 01:37:07,912
Winston! Winston!

665
01:37:12,321 --> 01:37:14,480
I need more firepower.

666
01:37:37,186 --> 01:37:39,172
Armor improvements.

667
01:37:39,513 --> 01:37:42,475
12-gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

668
01:41:09,682 --> 01:41:12,103
Only by my sword, John.

669
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,310
<i>I know you</i>
<i>believe you can keep this up.</i>

670
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:27,610
<i>But I assure you...</i>

671
01:49:32,808 --> 01:49:35,699
John, you're incredible.

672
01:49:36,488 --> 01:49:37,589
Exhausted,

673
01:49:37,990 --> 01:49:39,692
outnumbered...

674
01:49:39,858 --> 01:49:41,393
Obviously in pain.

675
01:49:42,705 --> 01:49:44,997
And you still beat
all of my students.

676
01:49:45,449 --> 01:49:47,115
If I didn't
have to kill you,

677
01:49:47,825 --> 01:49:50,128
we'd be pals.

678
01:49:50,736 --> 01:49:52,337
Let's do this.

679
01:50:20,113 --> 01:50:22,489
See? We're the same.

680
01:54:09,227 --> 01:54:11,467
I would like to suggest
a parley.

681
01:54:11,835 --> 01:54:13,574
A parley would be good.

682
01:54:13,674 --> 01:54:15,000
<i>Very well.</i>

683
01:54:26,239 --> 01:54:27,846
Are we in play, sir?

684
01:54:29,473 --> 01:54:30,849
Oh, very much so.

685
01:54:50,268 --> 01:54:51,447
Hey, John.

686
01:54:54,265 --> 01:54:56,616
That was
a pretty good fight, huh?

687
01:55:00,445 --> 01:55:01,687
Yeah.

688
01:55:31,207 --> 01:55:32,603
Yeah.

689
01:55:33,068 --> 01:55:36,449
Don't worry about me, John.

690
01:55:36,816 --> 01:55:39,017
I just gotta catch my breath.

691
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:42,654
I'll catch up to you, John.

692
01:55:47,791 --> 01:55:49,335
No, you won't.

693
01:56:00,089 --> 01:56:01,239
You gentlemen, of course,

694
01:56:01,339 --> 01:56:03,475
realize that was
the first wave.

695
01:56:03,715 --> 01:56:05,822
Merely an <i>amuse-bouche.</i>

696
01:56:06,115 --> 01:56:07,646
We can keep this up
as long as you'd like,

697
01:56:07,746 --> 01:56:09,568
but it only ends one way.

698
01:56:09,668 --> 01:56:11,917
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

699
01:56:12,017 --> 01:56:14,273
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

700
01:56:14,373 --> 01:56:15,694
Oh, you can take
the <i>Continental</i>,

701
01:56:15,794 --> 01:56:16,788
I have no doubt about that.

702
01:56:16,888 --> 01:56:19,124
But keeping it, that's
a different matter entirely.

703
01:56:19,224 --> 01:56:22,794
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

704
01:56:23,656 --> 01:56:25,197
We are High Table.

705
01:56:25,864 --> 01:56:27,098
And we

706
01:56:28,233 --> 01:56:29,927
are New York City.

707
01:56:30,907 --> 01:56:32,704
Are we negotiating?

708
01:56:34,806 --> 01:56:35,841
Hmm.

709
01:56:36,374 --> 01:56:37,876
I believe we are.

710
01:56:43,515 --> 01:56:44,716
Parley?

711
01:56:45,417 --> 01:56:46,885
Parley.

712
01:56:50,211 --> 01:56:52,624
What do you propose we do?

713
01:56:56,561 --> 01:56:58,763
Let me keep my power.

714
01:56:59,104 --> 01:57:00,499
Under the Table.

715
01:57:03,268 --> 01:57:04,703
I have served

716
01:57:04,836 --> 01:57:07,606
and been a beacon
of order and stability

717
01:57:07,706 --> 01:57:09,856
to our industry
for over 40 years.

718
01:57:09,956 --> 01:57:12,159
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped

719
01:57:12,259 --> 01:57:15,514
and re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

720
01:57:17,883 --> 01:57:19,284
Winston.

721
01:57:24,823 --> 01:57:26,458
You were
merely showing strength

722
01:57:26,558 --> 01:57:29,160
so we would let you
keep the <i>Continental</i>.

723
01:57:32,664 --> 01:57:35,311
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

724
01:57:36,904 --> 01:57:38,537
But what about him?

725
01:57:40,333 --> 01:57:43,640
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

726
01:57:49,569 --> 01:57:51,216
Oh, he has to die.

727
01:57:52,704 --> 01:57:54,486
- Sorry, Jonathan.
- Winston!

728
01:57:54,586 --> 01:57:55,754
Don't see any other way.

729
01:58:07,732 --> 01:58:09,387
Very well, gentlemen.

730
01:58:09,568 --> 01:58:12,792
The <i>Continental</i> will now
be reconsecrated.

731
01:58:13,772 --> 01:58:15,095
Good day to you both.

732
01:58:19,611 --> 01:58:20,975
Well played, sir.

733
01:58:56,681 --> 01:58:59,362
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

734
01:58:59,684 --> 01:59:01,420
Oh, should be no time at all.

735
01:59:05,423 --> 01:59:07,103
Mr. Wick is gone.

736
01:59:07,446 --> 01:59:08,990
A true tragedy.

737
01:59:09,161 --> 01:59:10,495
You misunderstand.

738
01:59:10,595 --> 01:59:13,350
I mean that he is no longer
on the street.

739
01:59:13,565 --> 01:59:14,633
That seems improbable.

740
01:59:14,733 --> 01:59:16,167
And yet, true.

741
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,357
<i>I trust you understand the</i>
<i>repercussions if he survives.</i>

742
01:59:20,457 --> 01:59:22,707
<i>Both from above and below.</i>

743
01:59:22,807 --> 01:59:24,242
The last thing
either one of us needs

744
01:59:24,342 --> 01:59:26,978
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

745
01:59:29,812 --> 01:59:31,746
<i>For both our sakes,</i>
<i>I'll hope you see to it</i>

746
01:59:31,846 --> 01:59:33,999
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

747
01:59:34,099 --> 01:59:37,922
Absolutely.
How far can he get?

748
01:59:49,435 --> 01:59:51,175
Baba Yaga.

749
02:00:03,548 --> 02:00:04,916
Mmm.

750
02:00:22,167 --> 02:00:24,491
How you doing, John?

751
02:00:24,703 --> 02:00:27,186
You look as bad as I feel.

752
02:00:29,121 --> 02:00:31,693
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

753
02:00:32,010 --> 02:00:34,315
Raise a hand
if you can hear me, John.

754
02:00:37,015 --> 02:00:39,655
Oh, shit.
They took a finger.

755
02:00:39,984 --> 02:00:41,639
Ain't that a bitch?

756
02:00:47,960 --> 02:00:51,610
Oh, John fucking Wick.

757
02:00:51,996 --> 02:00:54,599
So, the old boy
keeps his hotel

758
02:00:54,699 --> 02:00:56,142
and you take the fall.

759
02:00:56,301 --> 02:00:57,368
Can't say I blame him.

760
02:00:57,469 --> 02:00:59,939
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

761
02:01:00,625 --> 02:01:03,320
But this High Table shit...

762
02:01:06,511 --> 02:01:08,313
Seven cuts.

763
02:01:11,683 --> 02:01:14,343
Under the Table
is where shit gets done.

764
02:01:16,154 --> 02:01:19,120
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

765
02:01:19,316 --> 02:01:21,760
you better cut him
to the quick.

766
02:01:26,102 --> 02:01:27,766
So...

767
02:01:30,068 --> 02:01:31,982
Let me ask you, John.

768
02:01:32,423 --> 02:01:33,772
How do you feel?

769
02:01:36,074 --> 02:01:40,262
'Cause I am really pissed off.

770
02:01:41,217 --> 02:01:42,859
You pissed, John?

771
02:01:43,153 --> 02:01:44,279
Hmm?

772
02:01:44,582 --> 02:01:45,725
Are you?

773
02:01:55,560 --> 02:01:56,602
Yeah.
