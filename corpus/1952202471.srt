1
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:33,409
Guru Siyag: Ask Rosy why she is here, what she experienced during meditation in Israel,

2
00:00:33,922 --> 00:00:38,130
what she will do in the future and what her life in Israel is like.

3
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:43,013
Disciple: We want to know something about you.

4
00:00:47,637 --> 00:00:49,285
Which country do you belong to?

5
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:52,793
And how did you come to India?

6
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:44,968
Disciple: What experience have you got from Gurudev?

7
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:53,447
Disciple: What are your future plans regarding this situation (Guru Siyag’s Siddha Yoga)?

8
00:05:03,725 --> 00:05:07,573
Guru Siyag: Chant the mantra for 24 hours, round the clock.

9
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:30,151
Guru Siyag: The energy within you will soon start chanting the mantra on its own.

10
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,414
Guru Siyag: From January 16, Rosy has begun a new phase in her life.

11
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:07,383
This new life had begun a while ago in Tel Aviv (Israel) but at that time Rosy could not transfer this power to anyone.

12
00:06:08,809 --> 00:06:15,562
But now that she has come in physical touch with me, this power has been transferred to her

13
00:06:16,306 --> 00:06:23,655
and she can in turn use this power to bring about a palpable change anywhere in the world.

14
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:29,912
Guru Siyag: Rosy attained this power when she meditated in Tel Aviv.

15
00:06:30,606 --> 00:06:33,398
But it was limited only to her.

16
00:06:33,942 --> 00:06:38,802
She was initiated by me on January 16 and began chanting the mantra I gave.

17
00:06:39,569 --> 00:06:43,911
Now there is no difference between me and Rosy.

18
00:06:44,757 --> 00:06:51,851
Just as I am working for the upliftment of mankind, she too can now do the same.

19
00:06:52,166 --> 00:07:13,344
Disciple: (Translating).

20
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,991
Disciple: I have one question to ask you.

21
00:07:26,632 --> 00:07:28,787
When you saw the website, what attracted you to Guru Siyag?

22
00:07:29,348 --> 00:07:32,402
What made you believe that he is a real Guru?

23
00:07:33,163 --> 00:07:37,150
In India there are many Gurus. You said yesterday that every third person in India is a Guru.

24
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,429
Disciple: Now you believe Guru Siyag is the incarnation of Jesus?

25
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,802
Disciple: Are you sure?

26
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,158
Disciple: Now that you are near him, you believe.

27
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:20,375
Disciple: Now you believe that he is the Comforter?

28
00:10:26,239 --> 00:10:32,112
Disciple: Now according to your words even we can believe that he is the Comforter.

29
00:10:39,458 --> 00:10:40,482
Disciple: Do you think people will believe that?

30
00:10:41,934 --> 00:10:49,341
Disciple: Guru Siyag delegated her the powers, so now she can work.

31
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:32,079
Guru Siyag: Yes, that is Para Vani (Subtle or Divine speech)

32
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:50,582
This speech has no sound. Only divine light.

33
00:11:54,640 --> 00:12:02,386
This is the complete and final evolution of mankind.

34
00:12:09,534 --> 00:12:14,423
Now is also the time for a change in yuga (epoch or era within a cycle of four ages).

35
00:12:17,434 --> 00:12:23,483
Judgment will be done.

36
00:12:25,808 --> 00:12:31,592
The whole world will know what is true and what is false.

37
00:12:37,809 --> 00:12:42,277
All of mankind will undergo this evolution.

38
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:50,221
So, all of mankind has the right to know this truth.

39
00:12:58,576 --> 00:13:02,047
This is one of the principles of evolution.

40
00:13:09,964 --> 00:13:16,653
They (the West) is in need of the wealth (spiritualism) that we (the East) have

41
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:22,170
And we are in need of the material wealth that they have.

42
00:13:22,902 --> 00:13:26,621
This is an exchange between two powers.

43
00:13:27,996 --> 00:13:35,182
Cultures that do not participate in an exchange have difficulty surviving.

44
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:44,684
This exchange between two cultures began on January 16.

45
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:50,557
All of you here are witness to it.

46
00:13:51,511 --> 00:13:55,233
Now see what happens… wait and watch.

47
00:13:55,868 --> 00:14:00,231
Rosy does not know who she is. But I do.

48
00:14:03,336 --> 00:14:09,371
However, I will not explain everything right now.

49
00:14:12,825 --> 00:14:17,118
Now is not the time.

50
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:24,698
There are some things that I will say only when I go to Israel; I cannot speak of them here.

51
00:14:27,293 --> 00:14:29,905
Now meditate for 15 minutes.

52
00:15:31,713 --> 00:15:36,480
This age of darkness will soon come to an end.

53
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:52,952
‘Live and let live’ will be the principle on the basis of which the world will undergo a transformation.

54
00:15:57,105 --> 00:16:03,657
The divine force that has brought Rosy here will continue to guide her at all times.

55
00:16:04,169 --> 00:16:09,140
She cannot do anything by her own will. The divine force will guide her according to its will.

56
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:15,086
She is an instrument for the force and so to ask Rosy questions is futile.

57
00:16:25,468 --> 00:16:28,428
Material science is not bringing about a change in the world.

58
00:16:28,993 --> 00:16:32,481
You shouldn’t be under any such false impressions.

59
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:41,448
I am not against science but science has to understand spiritualism.

60
00:16:43,084 --> 00:16:47,179
That is why all of you here are people of science not religion.

61
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,179
Guru Siyag: Yes. For this holy purpose.

62
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,027
Rosy’s diabetes proved to be a boon for her.

63
00:17:03,477 --> 00:17:10,041
Disciple: Rosy told us yesterday that she began doing the meditation because she was suffering from diabetes.

64
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:21,332
Guru Siyag: The whole world is suffering from various diseases… whether they are from Israel, the US or India.

65
00:17:35,082 --> 00:17:42,188
Guru Siyag: AIDS is the most dangerous disease in the world today… and the meditation has destroyed it.

66
00:17:42,741 --> 00:17:50,328
AIDS is curable for free… free medical aid from India through this meditation.

67
00:17:51,504 --> 00:17:56,162
It is for all kinds of diseases.

68
00:18:08,446 --> 00:18:12,298
Disciple: You met the patient who had AIDS?

69
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:28,199
Guru Siyag: The newspaper has printed an article about him with photographs.
