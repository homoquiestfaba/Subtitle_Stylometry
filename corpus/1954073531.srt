00:00:02,111 --> 00:00:06,648
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome Bill Cosby!

3
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:35,710
Hello!

4
00:00:35,712 --> 00:00:36,912
All right.

5
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:41,650
Happy to have all of you here.

6
00:00:41,652 --> 00:00:45,554
And, uh...

7
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:56,631
When I said to some people,

8
00:00:56,633 --> 00:01:01,570
"I'm coming to cerritos,"
they said, "Ooh, good."

9
00:01:01,572 --> 00:01:07,075
I said, "We're gonna tape
for a TV show."

10
00:01:07,077 --> 00:01:10,745
So they said, "Oh, yeah?
What... what... a special for..."

11
00:01:10,747 --> 00:01:12,280
I said, "Yeah."

12
00:01:12,282 --> 00:01:13,648
So they said,
"Well, which one?"

13
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:15,417
I said, "Comedy Central."

14
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:18,353
So they said...

15
00:01:22,725 --> 00:01:26,628
"Excuse me, you?"

16
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:29,931
I said, "Yeah."

17
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:35,503
"Is this... is this
a new Comedy Central?"

18
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:40,075
I said, "No, it's the one
that you see all the time."

19
00:01:40,077 --> 00:01:43,778
So, like, one of the guys
started crying.

20
00:01:45,715 --> 00:01:46,948
So I said,
"What's the matter?"

21
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,650
He said...

22
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:51,152
"Mr. Cosby's gonna curse."

23
00:01:56,459 --> 00:01:59,961
And they walked away.

24
00:01:59,963 --> 00:02:02,864
So then,
another couple, they said,

25
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:07,135
"We... we hear you're...
you're gonna do a special."

26
00:02:07,137 --> 00:02:08,236
I said, "Yeah."

27
00:02:08,238 --> 00:02:12,107
So they said,
"On Comedy Central?"

28
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:14,843
They went like this...

29
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,278
I said, "Yeah."

30
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,812
They said...

31
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:24,486
"Then, uh, we can expect
to see some, uh..."

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,191
I said, "Not really."

33
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:35,430
"Well,
what are you gonna do?"

34
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:41,303
I said, "I'm gonna
<i>almost</i> talk that way."

35
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,607
They said,
"What do you mean?"

36
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:49,611
I said, "You know,
you aim at it, and you hit it,

37
00:02:49,613 --> 00:02:52,280
but nobody
heard you firing."

38
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:03,124
As you grow,
you find people in your way.

39
00:03:05,194 --> 00:03:08,830
Old people.

40
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:11,433
Two of 'em, you lived with.

41
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,607
So you become...

42
00:03:19,609 --> 00:03:24,612
A person who,
now managing your life,

43
00:03:24,614 --> 00:03:28,083
you fall in love.

44
00:03:28,085 --> 00:03:30,285
And you see the person

45
00:03:30,287 --> 00:03:35,824
that you want to spend
the rest of your life with.

46
00:03:35,826 --> 00:03:38,259
And you ask that person

47
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,729
to be with you when you die.

48
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:49,404
I mean... I mean,
that's essentially what I said.

49
00:03:49,406 --> 00:03:54,109
I didn't realize
what I was saying,

50
00:03:54,111 --> 00:03:55,343
but I said that.

51
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:57,946
I-I thought
I was being romantic.

52
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:00,148
I said to her,

53
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:04,152
"I would like to spend
the rest of my life with you."

54
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:09,057
Well, if you...
see, love...

55
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:13,595
When... there used to be a time
when songwriters wrote words,

56
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:15,730
and they...

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:22,270
They had...
they had stuff...

58
00:04:22,272 --> 00:04:26,307
"I lo... I'm crazy about you.
I love you.

59
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:30,178
I just can't think right.
I'm going mad."

60
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,447
And all of that.
And... and...

61
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:33,915
And it's true!

62
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:37,485
You're not making any sense.

63
00:04:37,487 --> 00:04:41,990
You want somebody
to be with you until you die.

64
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:44,492
That's not love.

65
00:04:46,128 --> 00:04:49,297
You know, I don't know
what you can call it,

66
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:53,234
but it's not romantic either.

67
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:56,004
I mean, you think about it,
you know, she's there,

68
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,073
and you say,
"I would like to spend

69
00:04:58,075 --> 00:04:59,474
the rest of my life
with you."

70
00:04:59,476 --> 00:05:02,210
Oh, whoops.
Wait a minute.

71
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:05,146
Whoops.
Wait a minute.

72
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:10,085
Let's go back and listen
to your grandmother.

73
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,889
After your grandfather died...

74
00:05:17,226 --> 00:05:20,195
And ten years later,
somebody says,

75
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:24,099
"Grandma, don't you want
to meet somebody, a man?"

76
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:28,470
"I don't want to take care
of another old man."

77
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:38,947
See, she's not in love anymore.

78
00:05:38,949 --> 00:05:41,416
Grandma says,
"Oh, no, you don't.

79
00:05:41,418 --> 00:05:44,452
You don't get me
one of those things, man."

80
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,724
When you fall in love,

81
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:53,294
you accept craziness.

82
00:05:53,296 --> 00:05:56,698
See...

83
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:59,834
Here she is.
Right there.

84
00:05:59,836 --> 00:06:05,173
She's called the "girlfriend."

85
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,508
Girlfriend.

86
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:10,678
Now, this person
is wonderful for you.

87
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:15,783
She will even drink beer...

88
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,521
With you

89
00:06:19,523 --> 00:06:22,190
and lay up in your ar...

90
00:06:22,192 --> 00:06:25,827
She will watch sports...

91
00:06:27,363 --> 00:06:29,063
With you,

92
00:06:29,065 --> 00:06:33,735
and... and even know
your friends by name...

93
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:37,805
And say the names like
she really likes the person.

94
00:06:39,308 --> 00:06:42,076
She's a wonderful person.

95
00:06:42,078 --> 00:06:46,481
This is the girlfriend.

96
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:49,017
<i>Friend.</i>

97
00:06:49,019 --> 00:06:51,653
Girl...

98
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:54,656
Okay?
Loving you!

99
00:06:54,658 --> 00:06:57,525
Pick you up anywhere.

100
00:06:57,527 --> 00:06:59,694
"Come and get me."
Zoom.

101
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:03,264
Right there.

102
00:07:03,266 --> 00:07:09,003
You can say to her,
"Do you have any money?"

103
00:07:09,005 --> 00:07:12,907
She will... she will say,
"I'm sorry, I don't."

104
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:17,679
Well, you can't get everything.

105
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,918
There she is.

106
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,020
But...

107
00:07:26,022 --> 00:07:30,425
After 49 years of experience,

108
00:07:30,427 --> 00:07:33,761
she is the lure.

109
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:36,998
You ever do fishing?

110
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,968
The lure is something
very beautiful,

111
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,604
and it bobs in the water.

112
00:07:45,642 --> 00:07:48,243
And it draws you...

113
00:07:53,282 --> 00:07:57,452
Yeah.
So nice, this person.

114
00:07:57,454 --> 00:07:59,921
So wonderful.

115
00:07:59,923 --> 00:08:05,059
You... you leave her, and she'll
call three minutes later.

116
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:07,262
"I miss you."

117
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:08,296
Yeah.

118
00:08:08,298 --> 00:08:11,232
You can call her.

119
00:08:11,234 --> 00:08:13,935
Any hour.
Any hour.

120
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:15,803
She's... "Yes, oh, yes.

121
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:18,072
I miss you so much.
When are you..."

122
00:08:18,074 --> 00:08:20,275
"Yes."

123
00:08:20,277 --> 00:08:22,543
The girl...

124
00:08:22,545 --> 00:08:23,611
Friend.

125
00:08:23,613 --> 00:08:25,480
Thank you very much.

126
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,484
So you want her...

127
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:38,626
So badly that you...

128
00:08:39,863 --> 00:08:44,666
Want to spend the rest
of your life

129
00:08:44,668 --> 00:08:48,336
with the girl...

130
00:08:48,338 --> 00:08:49,537
Friend.

131
00:08:49,539 --> 00:08:52,740
That's who you're proposing to.

132
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:59,047
So now you have
to go get a diamond...

133
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:06,020
Because a diamond

134
00:09:06,022 --> 00:09:08,022
is a girl's...

135
00:09:08,024 --> 00:09:10,625
Best friend.

136
00:09:18,901 --> 00:09:20,735
Hey.

137
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:25,473
Love... love is not...
you're not clear.

138
00:09:25,475 --> 00:09:28,309
You're not thinking...
you're not saying to yourself,

139
00:09:28,311 --> 00:09:31,245
"Wait a minute,
she's my girlfriend.

140
00:09:31,247 --> 00:09:34,415
"But if I want her to spend
the rest of my life,

141
00:09:34,417 --> 00:09:37,485
I have to go get her
her friend."

142
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:47,362
And maybe more.

143
00:09:48,964 --> 00:09:52,633
Now, everything
I'm telling you is not anti.

144
00:09:52,635 --> 00:09:54,535
You know, none of it is anti.

145
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:57,905
I'm just trying to make it
clear for the males,

146
00:09:57,907 --> 00:10:02,677
because somebody keeps
telling us that we are...

147
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:04,846
"You're the man.
You're..."

148
00:10:04,848 --> 00:10:07,548
No.

149
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:11,919
What we are
is not paying attention.

150
00:10:11,921 --> 00:10:14,555
You got to pay attention.

151
00:10:14,557 --> 00:10:18,793
There are people...
there are paradigms

152
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:22,029
of what is coming.

153
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:25,266
Your own father.

154
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:29,504
See, you think you can use him

155
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:32,507
because he's quiet.

156
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,643
And who helped him
to become that?

157
00:10:37,479 --> 00:10:41,015
See, it doesn't register
with you that his wife...

158
00:10:41,017 --> 00:10:43,684
"Don't say that
about my mother..."

159
00:10:43,686 --> 00:10:47,889
He... your mother...

160
00:10:47,891 --> 00:10:52,059
You know, I can't say
"wore him down"

161
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:54,729
or "beat him down."

162
00:10:54,731 --> 00:10:58,299
It's his choice

163
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:01,335
to be a quiet man.

164
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:05,173
A man who used to love to talk.

165
00:11:05,175 --> 00:11:10,511
A man who took you out places,
came back with you,

166
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:13,681
and then she said,
"What did you do?"

167
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:17,718
And you told her
what you and dad did.

168
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,556
And then she told him
not to do that anymore.

169
00:11:27,296 --> 00:11:29,997
I'm jumping ahead,

170
00:11:29,999 --> 00:11:31,866
'cause I'm not talking
about the girlfriend.

171
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,002
I'm talking
about where we're going.

172
00:11:35,004 --> 00:11:38,606
Yeah, here she is.
The wife.

173
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:44,212
See, when you... there's...
the game of chess.

174
00:11:44,214 --> 00:11:49,217
Supposedly, men made it up,
and it's about war and men

175
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:51,586
and the savageness
and the bravery

176
00:11:51,588 --> 00:11:55,923
and the genius of commanding
and moving pieces and...

177
00:11:55,925 --> 00:11:58,326
No.

178
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:01,262
It's marriage.

179
00:12:02,564 --> 00:12:06,300
The queen...

180
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:10,538
Moves anywhere she wants...

181
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:22,717
Picking off people.

182
00:12:22,719 --> 00:12:24,252
And what happens to the king?

183
00:12:24,254 --> 00:12:27,054
He's moving one square.

184
00:12:34,401 --> 00:12:37,036
You get the ring.

185
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:41,368
Then...
Then you're most humble.

186
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,899
You begin to think

187
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:47,889
what she will mean to you.

188
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:50,625
And you become humbled,
and you realize,

189
00:12:50,627 --> 00:12:53,762
as you are mad...
as you are mad,

190
00:12:53,764 --> 00:12:55,130
that you are really...

191
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:59,234
You put yourself in such
a low self-esteem position.

192
00:13:00,703 --> 00:13:03,772
"I am nothing.

193
00:13:03,774 --> 00:13:09,311
But if I have her,
I will conquer the world."

194
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:16,418
And you begin to want her
and need her,

195
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,721
because without her
by your side,

196
00:13:19,723 --> 00:13:22,023
you can't do it.

197
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:24,826
And then you have the nerve,

198
00:13:24,828 --> 00:13:29,431
after you give her her friend,

199
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,868
to tell her
how worthless you are.

200
00:13:36,072 --> 00:13:38,373
"I am nothing.

201
00:13:38,375 --> 00:13:43,678
And... and if you
will join me..."

202
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,082
Now, this
is getting stupid now...

203
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:53,989
But it is the lure
of her friend.

204
00:13:53,991 --> 00:13:57,626
She's not paying attention
to what you're saying.

205
00:13:59,629 --> 00:14:02,931
She's looking at the diamond.

206
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:05,800
She thinks you're saying,
"Please, marry me,"

207
00:14:05,802 --> 00:14:07,335
'cause that's all
they ever say.

208
00:14:07,337 --> 00:14:10,171
You say, "What did he say?"
"He asked me to marry him."

209
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:15,410
But you were babbling away
about being nobody and nothing

210
00:14:15,412 --> 00:14:19,681
and your heart and that
you're gonna die before her

211
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:23,618
and you want her there
to see this death.

212
00:14:29,325 --> 00:14:32,227
Later on, thousands of years,
a woman says,

213
00:14:32,229 --> 00:14:36,131
"I don't want to see that again
as long as I live."

214
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:39,968
So here we go.

215
00:14:39,970 --> 00:14:44,239
You ask any woman
in this audience who's married.

216
00:14:44,241 --> 00:14:45,674
"Did he ask you
to marry him?"

217
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,375
"Yes, he proposed."
"What did he say?"

218
00:14:47,377 --> 00:14:50,545
He said,
"Will you marry me?"

219
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:53,548
And that's because
she never paid attention.

220
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:01,323
Now, the two men...

221
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:06,094
The two men in the wedding...
important...

222
00:15:06,096 --> 00:15:09,030
are told what to do.

223
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:13,134
The father of the bride
is told.

224
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:18,173
"You walk her down here,

225
00:15:18,175 --> 00:15:21,476
"give her to him,

226
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:26,414
"and then you come over
and sit beside me.

227
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,022
"And stay sober.

228
00:15:38,794 --> 00:15:42,163
"And don't go around
asking strangers

229
00:15:42,165 --> 00:15:46,501
how much they think
all of this cost."

230
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,810
So much for the power
of the father of the bride.

231
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:57,846
The groom has no power.

232
00:15:57,848 --> 00:16:00,515
He's given an opportunity

233
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:05,120
to invite
all of his best buddies.

234
00:16:05,122 --> 00:16:07,822
They come,
and they are called the...

235
00:16:07,824 --> 00:16:09,824
- Groomsmen.
- The groomsmen.

236
00:16:09,826 --> 00:16:12,660
And the reason
why he's given that privilege

237
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:15,397
is because
this is the last time

238
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,267
he will ever see them...

239
00:16:26,475 --> 00:16:29,144
Except maybe as pallbearers.

240
00:16:33,549 --> 00:16:35,784
Now, I don't know if
you're planning to get married

241
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,018
for the first time.

242
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:40,388
All you fellas,
now just listen to me carefully.

243
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:45,326
I... If you can swing it,
I think it'll be very nice.

244
00:16:48,664 --> 00:16:54,002
Take... take the father
of the bride out.

245
00:16:54,004 --> 00:16:57,939
Let him sit
next to the bride's mother.

246
00:16:57,941 --> 00:16:59,507
In his place,

247
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:02,143
while you're standing

248
00:17:02,145 --> 00:17:04,813
and waiting for her,

249
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:09,584
you will put your mother.

250
00:17:09,586 --> 00:17:12,587
The groom's mother...
think about it...

251
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,990
is bringing her.

252
00:17:15,992 --> 00:17:20,929
You see?
You can now see your whole life.

253
00:17:25,568 --> 00:17:31,506
Here comes the woman
who brought you into this world,

254
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:36,411
now bringing to you
the woman who is going to...

255
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:39,747
No, let me say it!

256
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:50,458
Take you out.

257
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,393
Thank you.

258
00:17:58,868 --> 00:18:04,439
So now, you men pass up
certain things.

259
00:18:04,441 --> 00:18:05,974
You don't recognize...

260
00:18:05,976 --> 00:18:07,208
When you're married,

261
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:11,646
you don't recognize
certain things that...

262
00:18:11,648 --> 00:18:14,382
Pardon me...
that she's doing.

263
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:17,185
She's not an evil person.

264
00:18:17,187 --> 00:18:21,189
I don't think
that she is like a person...

265
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:22,957
"Uh, give me that big, red one.

266
00:18:22,959 --> 00:18:25,960
I'm gonna ride 'em
till he can't breathe anymore."

267
00:18:25,962 --> 00:18:27,428
No, I don't think that.

268
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,864
But I do know...

269
00:18:31,934 --> 00:18:36,771
That... that they...
they...

270
00:18:36,773 --> 00:18:41,176
Things belong to them...

271
00:18:41,178 --> 00:18:44,245
And you don't know that.

272
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:47,749
You think this is yours...

273
00:18:49,585 --> 00:18:52,153
That it belongs
to the two of you.

274
00:18:52,155 --> 00:18:54,155
"My wife and I."

275
00:18:54,157 --> 00:18:57,158
See, it's not true.

276
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,463
The first time I ever
talked out loud to myself...

277
00:19:03,666 --> 00:19:06,067
I was married seven months.

278
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:12,874
I came in,
and I took my shoes off,

279
00:19:12,876 --> 00:19:15,276
put 'em there,

280
00:19:15,278 --> 00:19:19,080
and I-I went back
to get something to drink,

281
00:19:19,082 --> 00:19:21,449
came back, and they were gone.

282
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:27,789
They were gone
because a part of my mind said...

283
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,726
Because the eyes told him,

284
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:35,029
"What happened to your shoes?"

285
00:19:37,099 --> 00:19:40,034
So I answered myself.

286
00:19:40,036 --> 00:19:42,403
I said, "I don't know."

287
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:49,577
So... so my brain said,
"Well, they were here."

288
00:19:49,579 --> 00:19:52,213
I said,
"Yeah, I took 'em off."

289
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:54,449
And then my brain said,
"Yeah, we saw you do that.

290
00:19:54,451 --> 00:19:57,952
We saw you...
you put 'em right there."

291
00:19:57,954 --> 00:20:02,557
So things start to move.

292
00:20:04,994 --> 00:20:07,962
And the reason is,
they are not...

293
00:20:07,964 --> 00:20:09,697
Yours.

294
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:11,566
And where they...

295
00:20:11,568 --> 00:20:14,235
- Belong.
- Belong!

296
00:20:14,237 --> 00:20:18,172
Said many of the wives
sitting in the back.

297
00:20:21,277 --> 00:20:24,846
Yeah, not... they're not
where they belong.

298
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:28,950
And you will find out,
when you ask very nicely,

299
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:33,755
"Dear..."
you have to.

300
00:20:33,757 --> 00:20:36,758
"Dear, have you seen my..."

301
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,394
And then, as you
stay married longer, they...

302
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,963
They get to sound
like judge Judy.

303
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:48,770
"I'm talking now.

304
00:20:50,873 --> 00:20:55,009
I put it where it belongs."

305
00:20:55,011 --> 00:20:57,045
And then you're scared.
You say...

306
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:59,781
You're scared to say,
"Well, where is that?"

307
00:21:07,823 --> 00:21:10,058
All you husbands know this.

308
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,194
People will say,
"Is your wife your friend?"

309
00:21:13,196 --> 00:21:16,130
You say, "My best friend."

310
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:21,869
"My best friend."

311
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:24,639
Because they better say it.

312
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:29,577
I-I know that's not
a good understanding

313
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:33,748
of a friendship,
that you better say it,

314
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,353
but that's the way it is
with your wife.

315
00:21:38,355 --> 00:21:41,255
Because she's not your friend,

316
00:21:41,257 --> 00:21:45,059
so you better say
she's your friend.

317
00:21:45,061 --> 00:21:48,563
No, she's not your friend.
That's your wife.

318
00:21:48,565 --> 00:21:50,798
Way above a friend.

319
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,802
See, this was your friend,

320
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:59,874
and you wanted to die
with somebody.

321
00:21:59,876 --> 00:22:02,543
Here she is.

322
00:22:02,545 --> 00:22:04,011
You see?

323
00:22:04,013 --> 00:22:05,947
So now, this is your wife.

324
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:10,918
So you could get a friend
just being a regular,

325
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,354
you know, nice person
or something.

326
00:22:13,356 --> 00:22:16,524
But a wife is special.

327
00:22:16,526 --> 00:22:18,393
But they want you to say,

328
00:22:18,395 --> 00:22:20,762
"She's my friend."

329
00:22:20,764 --> 00:22:23,331
But she's not your friend.

330
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:26,367
No, no, no, no, no.

331
00:22:26,369 --> 00:22:29,837
Let me give you an example.

332
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:34,242
I fly into Massachusetts.

333
00:22:35,644 --> 00:22:37,512
Get in my car.

334
00:22:37,514 --> 00:22:41,182
2:30 in the morning.

335
00:22:41,184 --> 00:22:42,350
I'm driving,

336
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:46,521
hour, 15-minute drive,
going home.

337
00:22:46,523 --> 00:22:51,292
All of a sudden,
I smell a wire burning.

338
00:22:51,294 --> 00:22:53,961
15 minutes out, wire burning,

339
00:22:53,963 --> 00:22:56,097
smell smoke,
the lights are dimming.

340
00:22:56,099 --> 00:22:59,233
All of a sudden, the car...
vroo...

341
00:22:59,235 --> 00:23:03,004
And I negotiate over,

342
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,107
I put it in park,
turn off the key.

343
00:23:06,109 --> 00:23:08,910
I go around, I lift the hood.

344
00:23:08,912 --> 00:23:13,080
This ends my knowledge
of how to fix the car.

345
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:23,224
I come back round, and I...

346
00:23:23,226 --> 00:23:25,793
2:45 A.M...

347
00:23:25,795 --> 00:23:30,531
I dial my <i>friend.</i>

348
00:23:32,134 --> 00:23:35,136
His name is Ed.

349
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:36,938
He's around my age.

350
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,974
So I said...
phone's ringing...

351
00:23:39,976 --> 00:23:41,542
You know.

352
00:23:41,544 --> 00:23:43,744
So Ed...
he picks up the phone.

353
00:23:43,746 --> 00:23:46,147
Now, he's asleep.
2:45.

354
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:50,318
He says...
you know, he tried to talk.

355
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,087
I said, "Ed."

356
00:23:53,089 --> 00:23:55,456
He said, "Cos."

357
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:59,994
That's my friend!

358
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,835
Ed!
That's my friend Ed!

359
00:24:07,837 --> 00:24:11,105
All I said was "Ed."
He said, "Cos."

360
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:17,178
He said,
"Are you all right?"

361
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:24,952
My friend Ed wanted to know...

362
00:24:24,954 --> 00:24:29,857
He was asleep,
and all I said was "Ed."

363
00:24:29,859 --> 00:24:32,727
"Cos, are you all right?"

364
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:45,406
I said, "Ed, I'm fine.

365
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:49,176
"I'm driving my car, Ed.
I'm I-91 North.

366
00:24:49,178 --> 00:24:51,946
"I'm an hour out from my house.

367
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,549
"I smell wire burning.

368
00:24:54,551 --> 00:24:57,985
"There's smoke,
engine lights go out, Ed,

369
00:24:57,987 --> 00:25:01,155
"and, Ed, my car is gone.

370
00:25:01,157 --> 00:25:03,124
"It's just stopped,

371
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:07,728
and I'm wondering, Ed,
if you'll come and get me."

372
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:13,301
My friend Ed said,

373
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,369
"Cos...

374
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,974
"Let me get dressed.

375
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,442
I'll be there."

376
00:25:29,651 --> 00:25:32,019
My friend...

377
00:25:32,021 --> 00:25:34,388
- Ed.
- No, say it!

378
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:35,389
Ed!

379
00:25:35,391 --> 00:25:36,958
There you go.
My friend!

380
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,159
Ed!

381
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,462
Ednah, I didn't ask you
to say it again.

382
00:25:45,033 --> 00:25:49,337
When I do like that,
that's when you say "Ed."

383
00:25:55,844 --> 00:25:58,713
My friend Ed
is coming to get me.

384
00:25:58,715 --> 00:25:59,947
He gave me a choice.

385
00:25:59,949 --> 00:26:02,283
He said,
"Cos, let me get dressed."

386
00:26:02,285 --> 00:26:03,451
I could've said,

387
00:26:03,453 --> 00:26:05,453
"Don't get dressed, Ed.
Come and get me."

388
00:26:10,959 --> 00:26:13,594
My friend Ed is coming.

389
00:26:13,596 --> 00:26:17,365
Now, let's... let's go
to this other person.

390
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:23,971
I'm not naming any names.

391
00:26:23,973 --> 00:26:27,842
Just going to another person.

392
00:26:27,844 --> 00:26:29,276
What time is it?

393
00:26:29,278 --> 00:26:32,013
2:45.
- 2:45 in the morning.

394
00:26:32,015 --> 00:26:34,248
Dial the number.

395
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:37,318
- She picked up the phone.
- She said...

396
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:41,389
I said, "Yes, my darling."

397
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:44,225
She said, "Oh, Billy."
I said, "Yes, dear."

398
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,526
She said,

399
00:26:45,528 --> 00:26:47,762
"Oh, how are you?

400
00:26:47,764 --> 00:26:49,063
What are you doing?"

401
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:52,033
I said,
"Dear, I'm about an hour out."

402
00:26:52,035 --> 00:26:55,169
She said, "Oh, wonderful.
You'll be home shortly."

403
00:26:55,171 --> 00:26:56,404
I said, "I don't think so."

404
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,773
She said,
"Oh, what's the matter?"

405
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:01,475
I said, "Well, dear,
I'm driving my car,

406
00:27:01,477 --> 00:27:05,346
"and smoke starts coming,
and the engine cut out,

407
00:27:05,348 --> 00:27:07,682
and I had to maneuver over..."

408
00:27:07,684 --> 00:27:09,750
And she said, "Bill."

409
00:27:09,752 --> 00:27:12,319
I said,
"I-It just won't run, dear."

410
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:14,755
She said, "Bill."

411
00:27:14,757 --> 00:27:15,923
I said, "Yes, dear?"

412
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,826
She said, "How many times...

413
00:27:21,863 --> 00:27:25,066
"Have I told you...

414
00:27:25,068 --> 00:27:29,637
to get that car fixed?"

415
00:27:37,045 --> 00:27:38,512
I said, "Many times."

416
00:27:38,514 --> 00:27:39,780
She said, "No, Bill.

417
00:27:39,782 --> 00:27:42,650
How many times?"

418
00:27:42,652 --> 00:27:45,820
I said, "Over a hundred."

419
00:27:45,822 --> 00:27:49,523
She said,
"So why are you calling me?"

420
00:27:52,761 --> 00:27:54,795
I said,
"Dear, I was hoping..."

421
00:27:54,797 --> 00:27:57,331
She said,
"Well, you got that right."

422
00:27:59,901 --> 00:28:02,603
"I was hoping that you
would come and get me."

423
00:28:02,605 --> 00:28:05,206
She said, "Bill...

424
00:28:05,208 --> 00:28:09,043
"Do you expect me
to get out of this bed,

425
00:28:09,045 --> 00:28:12,947
"drive an hour out
to wherever you are,

426
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:15,916
because you
don't listen to me?"

427
00:28:18,754 --> 00:28:22,289
She said,
"I'm gonna call the AAA.

428
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,125
When they bring you home, Bill,

429
00:28:24,127 --> 00:28:27,094
don't make a lot of noise."

430
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:32,500
I said, "Dear, the reason
why I make a lot of noise

431
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:37,571
"is because you won't let me
turn the lights on

432
00:28:37,573 --> 00:28:41,642
and you keep changing
the furniture around."

433
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,617
She said, "Well, you could
fall quieter than that."

434
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:56,991
Now, that's my <i>wife.</i>

435
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:58,826
My <i>friend...</i>

436
00:28:58,828 --> 00:29:00,094
Ed!

437
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:05,099
Is coming to get me,
because Ed is...

438
00:29:05,101 --> 00:29:07,101
A friend.

439
00:29:07,103 --> 00:29:09,637
No, no.
He's single.

440
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,464
I'm telling you now...
I'm not afraid to say it...

441
00:29:21,105 --> 00:29:24,506
I lost...

442
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:26,174
My key

443
00:29:26,176 --> 00:29:29,277
that was given to me.

444
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,314
I lost my key to the house.

445
00:29:34,484 --> 00:29:38,253
That was 48 years ago.

446
00:29:43,793 --> 00:29:46,895
I don't have a key.

447
00:29:48,197 --> 00:29:51,299
I don't know any codes.

448
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:55,270
Nothing.

449
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:59,241
I-I get off the plane,

450
00:29:59,243 --> 00:30:04,246
and... and someone
who works for us

451
00:30:04,248 --> 00:30:07,749
will pick me up, bring me home.

452
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,920
That person has a key.

453
00:30:17,493 --> 00:30:20,762
That's if my wife is not there.

454
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:23,999
And then that person
will lock me in.

455
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:31,473
There are instructions
written in the house

456
00:30:31,475 --> 00:30:35,343
what I cannot touch.

457
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:38,680
Because that's another thing
when you get married.

458
00:30:38,682 --> 00:30:41,216
You get up...
you been sleeping...

459
00:30:41,218 --> 00:30:44,753
You get up,
and she wakes up too.

460
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,054
"Where are you going?"

461
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:47,455
"I'm just going downstairs."

462
00:30:47,457 --> 00:30:51,126
"No, you stay up here.
You stay here with me."

463
00:30:51,128 --> 00:30:52,460
"Why?"

464
00:30:52,462 --> 00:30:55,163
"Because you're just gonna
be walking all around."

465
00:30:58,267 --> 00:30:59,434
"And what's wrong with that?"

466
00:30:59,436 --> 00:31:02,204
"I don't want you
touching anything!

467
00:31:09,011 --> 00:31:12,347
You don't know
how to lock up."

468
00:31:12,349 --> 00:31:14,182
"What do you mean?"

469
00:31:14,184 --> 00:31:16,318
They don't trust you.

470
00:31:18,387 --> 00:31:23,925
So she had to go
visit her mother,

471
00:31:23,927 --> 00:31:29,064
and she... she left.

472
00:31:29,066 --> 00:31:33,401
I waited and waited

473
00:31:33,403 --> 00:31:35,637
until she was gone
long enough, you know,

474
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,672
to be at her mother's house,

475
00:31:37,674 --> 00:31:42,577
and then I-I got up,
and I went to bed.

476
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:45,914
She won't let me
go to sleep early,

477
00:31:45,916 --> 00:31:48,650
but if she's not there,
she can't see where I am.

478
00:31:51,053 --> 00:31:55,223
So I put the pajamas on.

479
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,193
I got in the bed.

480
00:31:58,195 --> 00:32:02,197
So the phone rang,

481
00:32:02,199 --> 00:32:05,467
and I got out on my side

482
00:32:05,469 --> 00:32:10,005
and walked over to her side,
where the phone is.

483
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:13,708
I don't have a phone on my side

484
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,811
because my phone wakes her up.

485
00:32:19,348 --> 00:32:20,682
So...

486
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:26,354
You thought it was only
happening to you, didn't you?

487
00:32:28,557 --> 00:32:31,926
So I said, "Hello."

488
00:32:31,928 --> 00:32:33,662
It's a woman.

489
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:36,431
So she says,

490
00:32:36,433 --> 00:32:40,602
"I represent
the so-and-so security company."

491
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:45,173
She says,
"Who am I talking to?"

492
00:32:45,175 --> 00:32:50,712
I said,
"Well, I'm half-owner of...

493
00:32:50,714 --> 00:32:52,881
of the house."

494
00:32:52,883 --> 00:32:56,451
So she says...
she says,

495
00:32:56,453 --> 00:33:00,288
"Well, do you know

496
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:05,293
"that there's an alarm
going off...

497
00:33:05,295 --> 00:33:06,761
going off?"

498
00:33:06,763 --> 00:33:09,597
I said,
"I don't hear anything."

499
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,367
She said, "Well, it's going...
it's going...

500
00:33:12,369 --> 00:33:16,504
"It's showing up
that there's a malfunction

501
00:33:16,506 --> 00:33:20,975
in the front door
of the building."

502
00:33:20,977 --> 00:33:24,846
So I said, "Okay.
Well, just a minute."

503
00:33:24,848 --> 00:33:27,849
I put the phone down,
I went to the front door,

504
00:33:27,851 --> 00:33:32,854
and there's bolts and keys.

505
00:33:32,856 --> 00:33:36,591
So you unbolt
and turn the key, open,

506
00:33:36,593 --> 00:33:40,528
slam it, bolt, turn it.

507
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:45,767
Unbolt, unlock, open, slam it,

508
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:51,005
jiggle it, bang it,
bolt it back.

509
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:53,208
Turn the key.

510
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:55,377
I went back up.

511
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:56,978
I said, "How's it look?"

512
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,382
She said, "It still shows
there's a malfunction."

513
00:34:00,384 --> 00:34:05,086
She says, "And who...
what is your name?"

514
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,522
I said, "Cosby."

515
00:34:07,524 --> 00:34:11,626
She said,
"What is your code name?"

516
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:23,171
I said,
"I don't have a code name."

517
00:34:23,173 --> 00:34:25,306
She said, "Yes, you do."

518
00:34:28,177 --> 00:34:31,479
I said, "Ma'am,
I have to tell you...

519
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:36,484
"I don't drink, and I don't
do drugs or anything.

520
00:34:36,486 --> 00:34:40,922
"I know for sure
I don't have a code name.

521
00:34:40,924 --> 00:34:45,126
"I just have my regular name,
which my mother gave me,

522
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:48,863
and my wife even calls me
by that name."

523
00:34:48,865 --> 00:34:54,536
She said, "Well, sir, I'm
gonna have to call the police,

524
00:34:54,538 --> 00:34:56,037
because you don't know
your code..."

525
00:34:56,039 --> 00:35:00,542
I said, "Ma'am,
they're not gonna do anything

526
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:03,478
because I have a code face."

527
00:35:08,284 --> 00:35:10,051
I said,
"Just one second, please."

528
00:35:10,053 --> 00:35:14,923
So I put her on hold,

529
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:17,125
and it's blinking,

530
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:19,994
and I punch down another line,

531
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:23,064
and I dial
my mother-in-law's house.

532
00:35:23,066 --> 00:35:25,600
The phone is ringing,
and my wife picked up.

533
00:35:25,602 --> 00:35:26,801
She said, "Hello."

534
00:35:26,803 --> 00:35:29,370
I said, "Oh, I'm so happy
to reach you."

535
00:35:29,372 --> 00:35:31,573
She said, "Hi, honey.
How are you?"

536
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:33,975
"I'm home."
She said, "I'm at mom's."

537
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:35,877
I said, "Yeah.
Just a minute, dear."

538
00:35:35,879 --> 00:35:37,879
She said, "What's the matter?
What's the matter?"

539
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:39,180
I said, "There's nothing wrong,

540
00:35:39,182 --> 00:35:41,282
but the lady
from the security company..."

541
00:35:41,284 --> 00:35:43,351
She said,
"What did you do?"

542
00:35:46,188 --> 00:35:48,122
I said, "I didn't
do anything, dear.

543
00:35:48,124 --> 00:35:49,657
Just one second."

544
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:52,660
So, uh...

545
00:35:52,662 --> 00:35:55,263
Conference.

546
00:35:55,265 --> 00:35:59,267
So I punch down the conference,
and I punch down my wife.

547
00:35:59,269 --> 00:36:01,269
I said, "Hello?"
My wife said, "Hello?"

548
00:36:01,271 --> 00:36:02,504
And the woman said, "Hello!"

549
00:36:02,506 --> 00:36:05,707
I said, "All right!"

550
00:36:10,146 --> 00:36:13,314
So I said, "Ma'am?"
The lady said, "Yes."

551
00:36:13,316 --> 00:36:15,083
I said, "This is my wife."

552
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:17,519
So the woman said,
"Yes, how are you?"

553
00:36:17,521 --> 00:36:19,654
My wife says, "I'm fine."

554
00:36:19,656 --> 00:36:23,491
So my wife says,
"What is the problem?"

555
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,860
So the woman said,
"Well, there's a malfunction

556
00:36:25,862 --> 00:36:29,531
"on the front door
of the building

557
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:33,067
that this gentleman
is in."

558
00:36:33,069 --> 00:36:38,740
So my wife said,
"Did you touch that front door?"

559
00:36:38,742 --> 00:36:40,575
I said, "No, I didn't."

560
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:43,244
The woman said,
"Yes, he did."

561
00:36:49,151 --> 00:36:51,786
I said, "Now, look, lady.
You gotta...

562
00:36:51,788 --> 00:36:54,622
"You know,
there is a timeline here.

563
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:57,859
"I touched the door
after you told me

564
00:36:57,861 --> 00:36:59,027
there was something wrong."

565
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:02,030
She said,
"Oh, yeah. Okay."

566
00:37:02,032 --> 00:37:05,366
So the woman said,
"And what is your name, ma'am?"

567
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:07,702
She said, "Mrs. Cosby."

568
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:10,071
And the woman said,
"That is correct."

569
00:37:10,073 --> 00:37:13,308
She said...

570
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:16,844
She said,
"And what is your code name?"

571
00:37:16,846 --> 00:37:18,713
My wife said, "Pearl."

572
00:37:18,715 --> 00:37:20,515
She said, "That's correct."

573
00:37:20,517 --> 00:37:23,084
She said, "And I just want
to tell you, Mrs. Cosby,

574
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:26,621
"how wonderful it is to speak
to someone who has a code name

575
00:37:26,623 --> 00:37:29,424
"that makes some sense and not
a bunch of pervert things

576
00:37:29,426 --> 00:37:32,193
going out that you
have to hear and say."

577
00:37:32,195 --> 00:37:34,095
My wife said,
"Thank you, but you know,

578
00:37:34,097 --> 00:37:36,931
"I was in the andes,
and we were all around,

579
00:37:36,933 --> 00:37:39,033
"and I saw the pearls
and the people,

580
00:37:39,035 --> 00:37:41,469
and I said, 'oh, my God,
I've got the name.'"

581
00:37:41,471 --> 00:37:44,339
and the woman said,
"Oh, yes, I plan to go there,

582
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:47,075
"and we're going to do
all of this and that,

583
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:51,012
and they're the same colors,
and so you don't mind if I..."

584
00:37:51,014 --> 00:37:52,747
"Oh, yes,
it's a wonderful place,

585
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:55,783
and you should see
the thing..."

586
00:37:55,785 --> 00:37:59,787
She said, "By the way, your...
this man is your husband?"

587
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:02,490
My wife said, "Yes."

588
00:38:02,492 --> 00:38:06,894
She said, "He doesn't... he says
he doesn't have a code name."

589
00:38:06,896 --> 00:38:08,196
So my wife said,
"Yes, he does."

590
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:10,565
I said, "No, I don't."

591
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:14,102
My wife said,
"You do have a code name."

592
00:38:14,104 --> 00:38:16,938
She said, "And I told you
your code name."

593
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,974
I said,
"You never told me anything.

594
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:21,175
You never said..."

595
00:38:21,177 --> 00:38:24,779
She said, "I told you
your code name twice,

596
00:38:24,781 --> 00:38:26,114
"as a matter of fact,

597
00:38:26,116 --> 00:38:29,217
and then I told you
to write it down."

598
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:34,989
I said, "Well, I don't know
anything about a code name."

599
00:38:34,991 --> 00:38:38,426
So the woman said,
"And what is his code name?"

600
00:38:38,428 --> 00:38:41,229
My wife said, "Bill."

601
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,676
I was going to have

602
00:38:54,678 --> 00:38:58,212
this woman reported,

603
00:38:58,214 --> 00:39:00,481
because...

604
00:39:00,483 --> 00:39:03,918
No, you can't do that.

605
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,621
But I didn't report her

606
00:39:06,623 --> 00:39:09,724
because I didn't know
how to spell...

607
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:17,198
See, that's the sound she made
to keep from laughing.

608
00:39:20,035 --> 00:39:22,737
My wife said, "Bill,"
and this woman went...

609
00:39:26,209 --> 00:39:28,342
And then she said to my wife,

610
00:39:28,344 --> 00:39:31,179
"Mrs. Cosby,
please don't be dismayed.

611
00:39:31,181 --> 00:39:34,449
I have one of these
at home too."

612
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,592
So I said, "Well...

613
00:39:44,594 --> 00:39:49,197
"If you told me twice
my code name,

614
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:52,734
"and if... and I'm talking
to both of you...

615
00:39:52,736 --> 00:39:55,870
"If you told me
to write it down,

616
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:59,774
why is it I don't remember
what you said?"

617
00:39:59,776 --> 00:40:02,643
And both of them
said simultaneously,

618
00:40:02,645 --> 00:40:04,345
"Because you don't..."

619
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:05,370
Listen.

620
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:08,793
No, no, I'm not talking to you.

621
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:17,868
You weren't there.

622
00:40:23,285 --> 00:40:24,819
So we went
to this one restaurant

623
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,633
in New York City,

624
00:40:27,635 --> 00:40:32,192
and he has a bakery
next door... next door.

625
00:40:32,193 --> 00:40:36,362
So it's like the bakery,
and then you go in,

626
00:40:36,364 --> 00:40:37,897
and there's curtain,

627
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:40,699
curtain,
and a door to the bakery.

628
00:40:40,701 --> 00:40:43,469
And then there's a curtain,
and then there's a door

629
00:40:43,471 --> 00:40:46,238
and a curtain
to the restaurant.

630
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,010
So when we got out of the car,
I'm walking,

631
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:54,713
and we get out far enough back

632
00:40:54,715 --> 00:40:58,984
that I could see the cookies.

633
00:41:01,154 --> 00:41:03,355
And I noticed

634
00:41:03,357 --> 00:41:08,894
that they had chocolate chip
cookies this size.

635
00:41:08,896 --> 00:41:14,200
Bigger than famous amos,
smaller than Mrs. fields.

636
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:18,270
So listen, this is
where you can put two in.

637
00:41:21,575 --> 00:41:24,110
So the bad boys up here,

638
00:41:24,112 --> 00:41:29,448
they're... "Oh, man,
we gonna party!"

639
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,784
"Yeah, but how do we get there?
How do we get there?"

640
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:33,419
"Don't worry,
he'll figure it out.

641
00:41:33,421 --> 00:41:35,321
He's smart."
You know.

642
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:40,326
So we go... she did not
look like she saw it.

643
00:41:56,076 --> 00:42:00,946
And we went in and so...

644
00:42:00,948 --> 00:42:02,348
"Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Cosby.

645
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,749
How do you do?
Sit there,"

646
00:42:03,751 --> 00:42:05,451
and people sitting.

647
00:42:05,453 --> 00:42:07,953
And I'm...
so he pulls...

648
00:42:07,955 --> 00:42:13,526
So my back is to the door,
and she's there.

649
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:15,861
Fella says,
"And there's the menu for you,

650
00:42:15,863 --> 00:42:17,863
and will your husband
be having a menu?"

651
00:42:17,865 --> 00:42:20,633
"No, I'll select
something for him."

652
00:42:20,635 --> 00:42:22,868
She says, "Oh, I see you have

653
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:26,639
the poached breast
of chicken foot."

654
00:42:31,444 --> 00:42:33,045
And she started laughing.

655
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:37,216
"Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I got you. I got you."

656
00:42:39,386 --> 00:42:42,488
"No, you scared me."

657
00:42:42,490 --> 00:42:46,125
So she ordered something for me

658
00:42:46,127 --> 00:42:49,228
that was poached, uh...

659
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,996
With nothing, you know?

660
00:42:50,998 --> 00:42:56,936
Just... you will taste
the flavor of how it died.

661
00:43:04,477 --> 00:43:06,979
So...

662
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:11,250
She ordered some kind of salmon

663
00:43:11,252 --> 00:43:13,886
from rangoon,

664
00:43:13,888 --> 00:43:17,923
which has been buried

665
00:43:17,925 --> 00:43:21,794
for 12 years

666
00:43:21,796 --> 00:43:27,800
and then was wrapped
in fig leaves

667
00:43:27,802 --> 00:43:30,469
from a village

668
00:43:30,471 --> 00:43:35,241
where only virgins...

669
00:43:35,243 --> 00:43:38,177
Male... male virgins...

670
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:42,715
Come and sing to the trees

671
00:43:42,717 --> 00:43:44,383
and the leaves.

672
00:43:48,788 --> 00:43:51,090
It was wonderful.

673
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:53,325
She just swooned, listening...

674
00:43:53,327 --> 00:43:56,495
"I don't know how chef
thinks of these things."

675
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:59,732
And so she ordered that

676
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:02,635
with, uh, with prunes.

677
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:07,473
No, it wasn't "ew."
She... she's... prunes.

678
00:44:07,475 --> 00:44:11,777
And they bring a small tree,
and you pick your own prunes.

679
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,180
Put 'em on your plate.

680
00:44:15,182 --> 00:44:18,917
So I said to her...

681
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:22,855
Now, this is the part
of marriage where you...

682
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:27,259
I mean, you're both good.

683
00:44:27,261 --> 00:44:30,663
You both know each other
very well.

684
00:44:30,665 --> 00:44:34,800
"Soon I will get <i>you,</i>
lady Cosby.

685
00:44:41,274 --> 00:44:43,742
"I bleed not.

686
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:46,512
"This is but a scar.

687
00:44:46,514 --> 00:44:49,181
Aah!"

688
00:44:50,483 --> 00:44:52,418
I said to her,

689
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:57,423
"If you will excuse me,
I will go to the bathroom."

690
00:44:57,425 --> 00:44:58,724
She said, "All right."

691
00:44:58,726 --> 00:45:01,493
So I got up, and I went...

692
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:09,735
The lady at the desk...

693
00:45:09,737 --> 00:45:12,004
"May I help you, Mr. Cosby?"

694
00:45:12,006 --> 00:45:15,741
"Uh, no,
I'm going straight ahead."

695
00:45:15,743 --> 00:45:19,678
Door, curtain, bakery.

696
00:45:21,181 --> 00:45:26,185
So there's a-a couple

697
00:45:26,187 --> 00:45:28,587
and a little child.

698
00:45:28,589 --> 00:45:32,091
I go up, and I'm in...
you know, in a hurry.

699
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:35,260
So there's a lady
waiting on them.

700
00:45:35,262 --> 00:45:37,096
So there's another lady

701
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:38,964
that didn't look like
she was doing anything.

702
00:45:38,966 --> 00:45:40,833
You know, New York City.

703
00:45:40,835 --> 00:45:42,701
And, uh, I said,
"Pardon me."

704
00:45:42,703 --> 00:45:44,937
She said,
"I'm very busy right now."

705
00:45:44,939 --> 00:45:46,305
I said, "Oh, yes, ma'am,

706
00:45:46,307 --> 00:45:51,143
but I just need t-two things,
please, if you don't..."

707
00:45:51,145 --> 00:45:54,146
"Oh, hello, what do you need?
What do you need?"

708
00:45:54,148 --> 00:45:57,149
I said, "Just give me two
chocolate chip cookies, please."

709
00:45:57,151 --> 00:45:59,985
"Well, you just can't have two.
You have to buy a dozen."

710
00:45:59,987 --> 00:46:01,987
"Well, good,
I will buy a dozen,

711
00:46:01,989 --> 00:46:04,623
"but give me two now, please.

712
00:46:04,625 --> 00:46:06,291
Just give me two."

713
00:46:06,293 --> 00:46:08,527
"First,
I have to put the gloves on."

714
00:46:08,529 --> 00:46:11,096
"All right, put on one glove.
Give me two cookies.

715
00:46:11,098 --> 00:46:14,066
"Please, hurry, 'cause
I have to get out of here.

716
00:46:14,068 --> 00:46:15,801
So give me..."

717
00:46:15,803 --> 00:46:18,370
What! I put 'em in...

718
00:46:18,372 --> 00:46:20,072
Chew the thing,
and now she's putting 'em...

719
00:46:21,308 --> 00:46:23,275
I said, "Here, keep the change.

720
00:46:23,277 --> 00:46:24,843
It's all right.
Don't worry."

721
00:46:24,845 --> 00:46:26,779
"No, you will get the change.
You got to..."

722
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:29,081
I said, "I don't have time!
I'm sorry."

723
00:46:29,083 --> 00:46:32,384
And I went through a bunch
of curtains, then the door.

724
00:46:32,386 --> 00:46:34,586
Stood there
with the curtain blocking.

725
00:46:54,441 --> 00:46:57,042
She's sitting there.

726
00:46:57,044 --> 00:46:59,511
I sit down.

727
00:46:59,513 --> 00:47:02,748
She draws the sword.

728
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:12,991
"Where did you go?"

729
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:27,072
"I told you...

730
00:47:27,074 --> 00:47:29,408
Where I went."

731
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:37,749
She said, "I know...

732
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:40,953
"What you told me...

733
00:47:43,857 --> 00:47:47,259
But that's not
what I asked you."

734
00:47:52,065 --> 00:47:55,067
I said, "I went...

735
00:47:58,338 --> 00:48:01,640
To the bathroom."

736
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:06,011
She said,
"No, you didn't."

737
00:48:11,751 --> 00:48:13,919
She said, "You went...

738
00:48:17,323 --> 00:48:20,259
"That way.

739
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:25,030
The bathroom is that way."

740
00:48:26,266 --> 00:48:29,034
I said, "Yes.

741
00:48:29,036 --> 00:48:31,203
"This is true.

742
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:38,877
"But...

743
00:48:38,879 --> 00:48:42,848
"The bathroom
for the regular people...

744
00:48:45,084 --> 00:48:47,553
"is there.

745
00:48:47,555 --> 00:48:49,821
"For the stars...

746
00:48:53,092 --> 00:48:55,861
"It's that way.

747
00:48:55,863 --> 00:48:57,796
Ha!"

748
00:49:02,669 --> 00:49:05,604
She said,

749
00:49:05,606 --> 00:49:10,542
"You went into that bakery...

750
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:20,185
"and you ate

751
00:49:20,187 --> 00:49:23,855
a chocolate chip cookie!"

752
00:49:25,592 --> 00:49:30,362
And I said, "Ha, ha, ha!

753
00:49:30,364 --> 00:49:33,966
"That's where you are wrong!

754
00:49:37,737 --> 00:49:42,274
"I did not have...

755
00:49:42,276 --> 00:49:44,476
<i>"A...</i>

756
00:49:49,382 --> 00:49:52,818
Chocolate chip cookie!"

757
00:49:55,021 --> 00:49:57,990
She said, "You did."

758
00:49:59,859 --> 00:50:04,162
She said,
"Let me smell your breath."

759
00:50:06,132 --> 00:50:09,134
I said, "You'll smell nothing.

760
00:50:13,673 --> 00:50:16,141
"You think
I'm one of your children.

761
00:50:16,143 --> 00:50:20,812
"Going around smelling people!

762
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:22,914
Apologize!"

763
00:50:26,586 --> 00:50:29,454
The woman from the bakery...

764
00:50:38,164 --> 00:50:41,400
It was not a pretty scene.

765
00:50:41,402 --> 00:50:45,871
The woman from the bakery
came with the bag

766
00:50:45,873 --> 00:50:49,341
with the ten
chocolate chip cookies.

767
00:50:49,343 --> 00:50:54,146
It was piling on
like I've never seen before.

768
00:50:54,148 --> 00:50:57,315
"Mr. Cosby!
What is wrong with you?

769
00:50:57,317 --> 00:51:00,752
"You forgot
your ten other cookies,

770
00:51:00,754 --> 00:51:05,891
and you ate the other two
so fast in there."

771
00:51:05,893 --> 00:51:07,659
I said,
"I don't know you, lady."

772
00:51:07,661 --> 00:51:09,995
She said,

773
00:51:09,997 --> 00:51:12,597
"And here's your change."

774
00:51:18,771 --> 00:51:24,676
And then my wife stuck
her sword through my neck.

775
00:51:28,449 --> 00:51:30,882
Oh, you liked that part,
didn't you?

776
00:51:32,552 --> 00:51:34,720
And said,
"Chew on that."

777
00:51:37,857 --> 00:51:40,592
Yes, but getting back...

778
00:51:40,594 --> 00:51:44,996
And then, the other dream:
the children.

779
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:47,799
These children...
we will have these children,

780
00:51:47,801 --> 00:51:49,267
and they will go on.

781
00:51:49,269 --> 00:51:51,670
We will give them love,
and they will go on.

782
00:51:51,672 --> 00:51:54,973
We will give them care
and go on in health and go on,

783
00:51:54,975 --> 00:51:56,875
and these are our children,

784
00:51:56,877 --> 00:52:00,345
and they will love us
and everything.

785
00:52:02,348 --> 00:52:05,917
And I'm... I'm driving them.

786
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:07,719
There's three of them.

787
00:52:07,721 --> 00:52:11,857
It's my turn to drive 'em
to school.

788
00:52:11,859 --> 00:52:13,992
Block and a half from school...

789
00:52:13,994 --> 00:52:17,262
"Dad, dad, wait, wait, stop.
Stop the car."

790
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:18,263
"What's the matter?"

791
00:52:18,265 --> 00:52:20,899
"Can... can you
let us out here?"

792
00:52:22,568 --> 00:52:24,803
"No, your mother
said to take you

793
00:52:24,805 --> 00:52:27,139
straight to the front
of the school."

794
00:52:27,141 --> 00:52:29,141
"No, no, dad.
No, she didn't mean that.

795
00:52:29,143 --> 00:52:30,408
She means to let..."

796
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:34,379
"No, don't tell me
what she means.

797
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:36,014
"I know what your mother said.

798
00:52:36,016 --> 00:52:39,551
"Your mother said
drop you off in front of the...

799
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:42,053
"I don't know what you guys
are trying to pull,

800
00:52:42,055 --> 00:52:44,689
but you're getting off
in front of the school."

801
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:46,525
"Dad, please.
Please, don't do that.

802
00:52:46,527 --> 00:52:49,261
Please, don't... dad, don't,
don't, don't, don't, don't."

803
00:52:49,263 --> 00:52:51,763
"Okay, 'don't, don't, don't,
don't, don't.'

804
00:52:51,765 --> 00:52:53,799
What is the problem?"

805
00:52:53,852 --> 00:52:55,718
"Dad, there's no problem.

806
00:52:55,720 --> 00:53:01,557
We just want to walk
from here to the school."

807
00:53:01,559 --> 00:53:04,560
"But your mother
said to drop you..."

808
00:53:04,562 --> 00:53:06,796
"Dad, please,
if you let us off here,

809
00:53:06,798 --> 00:53:08,564
we will never say anything."

810
00:53:08,566 --> 00:53:11,834
"Oh, don't lie to me
about that.

811
00:53:13,671 --> 00:53:18,408
Now, you're gonna tell me
what the problem is."

812
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:20,977
So I turned around,
and I looked at 'em.

813
00:53:20,979 --> 00:53:23,880
And when you're
an experienced parent,

814
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:25,982
you pick out the weak one.

815
00:53:33,924 --> 00:53:35,858
"Judas...

816
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:44,133
"Come on, talk to me.
Talk to me.

817
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:52,341
"Come on, you can.
You can.

818
00:53:52,343 --> 00:53:55,178
Say it.
Don't be afraid of the others."

819
00:54:00,617 --> 00:54:05,221
So finally, the old one said,

820
00:54:05,223 --> 00:54:08,991
"The reason why we want to walk

821
00:54:08,993 --> 00:54:11,561
"is because our friends

822
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:15,498
make fun of us."

823
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,567
"About what?"

824
00:54:17,569 --> 00:54:21,904
"Um, they say that, um,

825
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:25,608
we think we're rich."

826
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,744
"Why didn't you tell me that?

827
00:54:27,746 --> 00:54:29,045
"Why didn't you say that?

828
00:54:29,047 --> 00:54:32,381
"I can clear it up for you
right away.

829
00:54:36,053 --> 00:54:40,423
"Listen, your mother and I
are rich.

830
00:54:50,768 --> 00:54:54,437
"You guys have nothing.

831
00:54:54,439 --> 00:54:56,205
"I mean, think about it.

832
00:54:56,207 --> 00:54:59,208
"Every time you want something,
you ask us, don't you?

833
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:00,810
"That means you have nothing.

834
00:55:00,812 --> 00:55:03,913
"Defend yourself!

835
00:55:03,915 --> 00:55:05,782
"People say, 'oh, you guys
think you're rich.'

836
00:55:05,784 --> 00:55:07,550
"You say, 'no, we don't!

837
00:55:07,552 --> 00:55:09,852
"'That's my father's car.

838
00:55:09,854 --> 00:55:12,155
"It's my mother's house.

839
00:55:12,157 --> 00:55:13,556
"We have nothing!'

840
00:55:13,558 --> 00:55:16,025
"Say that to them.

841
00:55:16,027 --> 00:55:19,028
"And I'll prove it.
Just... I'll prove it.

842
00:55:19,030 --> 00:55:23,933
"The state is making us
do these things.

843
00:55:23,935 --> 00:55:26,836
"If we don't do it,
we go to jail.

844
00:55:29,473 --> 00:55:32,241
"Another thing,
you have no money.

845
00:55:32,243 --> 00:55:35,978
"You're homeless also.

846
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:38,948
"Your name's not
on the mortgage or anything.

847
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:43,286
Tell your friends that.
Defend yourself!"

848
00:55:43,288 --> 00:55:45,288
"Well, we just
wanna get out of here,

849
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:46,889
and we just
wanna walk, and..."

850
00:55:46,891 --> 00:55:49,025
"Besides,
they're not your friends,

851
00:55:49,027 --> 00:55:51,594
"'cause if they
were your friends,

852
00:55:51,596 --> 00:55:55,665
"they would like you
for who you are,

853
00:55:55,667 --> 00:55:57,867
period, regardless."

854
00:55:57,869 --> 00:55:59,202
"Well..."

855
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:00,670
"Evin," I say, "Look, okay?

856
00:56:00,672 --> 00:56:03,005
I've had enough of this."

857
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:04,807
Made a u-turn.

858
00:56:04,809 --> 00:56:07,877
I went all the way back
about 1/2 mile.

859
00:56:10,314 --> 00:56:12,949
Made another u-turn.

860
00:56:12,951 --> 00:56:16,118
I said, "Get out."

861
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,054
"Get out?
But... get out?"

862
00:56:18,056 --> 00:56:20,823
"Yes, get out."

863
00:56:22,392 --> 00:56:24,060
"But, dad, this is a long..."

864
00:56:24,062 --> 00:56:26,062
"Yes!

865
00:56:26,064 --> 00:56:29,732
"Think of how your friends
will love you even more.

866
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:36,005
"Come on. You...

867
00:56:36,007 --> 00:56:38,274
You can do it.
You can do it. Get out."

868
00:56:38,276 --> 00:56:39,942
"But, dad,
we don't wanna get out."

869
00:56:39,944 --> 00:56:43,746
"No, no, you're gonna prove this
to your friends."

870
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:47,083
I close the door, and I
made a u-turn, going home.

871
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:49,218
I'm driving.
I look through the rearview.

872
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,654
They're fighting mad
with each other, man.

873
00:56:51,656 --> 00:56:54,123
Not throwing any punches,
but it's getting close.

874
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:03,766
So I make another u-turn,
and I come back.

875
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:07,003
"What's the problem?"

876
00:57:07,005 --> 00:57:10,373
"We don't...
we don't wanna walk."

877
00:57:10,375 --> 00:57:13,910
"Okay, get in the car."

878
00:57:13,912 --> 00:57:18,414
I drive all the way up

879
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:21,284
to the front of the school.

880
00:57:21,286 --> 00:57:23,352
In front of us...
I told 'em.

881
00:57:23,354 --> 00:57:24,754
I said, "Look at that.

882
00:57:24,756 --> 00:57:26,856
"Your friends
talking about being rich.

883
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:32,528
"They just drove up here
in a $300,000 bus.

884
00:57:43,373 --> 00:57:44,674
Go ahead."

885
00:57:44,676 --> 00:57:46,509
So they got out.

886
00:57:46,511 --> 00:57:49,879
They're walking,
and then they go on the grass,

887
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:54,383
and they're meeting
with their friends outside,

888
00:57:54,385 --> 00:57:57,520
and all of a sudden,
I put it in park,

889
00:57:57,522 --> 00:58:01,557
opened the door,
and I walked over to 'em.

890
00:58:05,529 --> 00:58:08,698
And I looked at 'em,
with their friends around them,

891
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:10,900
and I said,

892
00:58:10,902 --> 00:58:12,835
"Kiss me."

893
00:58:22,346 --> 00:58:24,814
It was wonderful.

894
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:29,352
I remember my wife...

895
00:58:29,354 --> 00:58:32,054
Our first one
was ten years old...

896
00:58:32,056 --> 00:58:34,190
And I think my wife
had some dreams

897
00:58:34,192 --> 00:58:39,128
of this first-born
being a friend

898
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:42,331
and the two of them
growing together.

899
00:58:42,333 --> 00:58:43,799
"Which one is the mother?"

900
00:58:48,772 --> 00:58:52,208
Not once she turned ten.

901
00:58:52,210 --> 00:58:53,409
My wife called me.

902
00:58:53,411 --> 00:58:56,512
"Bill!
May I see you?"

903
00:58:56,514 --> 00:58:59,448
And I have this habit...

904
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:02,351
If I can't see her,
I don't answer.

905
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:08,457
Then I heard her coming,
and I answered,

906
00:59:08,459 --> 00:59:10,860
"Yes, dear?"

907
00:59:14,498 --> 00:59:17,700
She said,
"Come with me, please."

908
00:59:17,702 --> 00:59:21,637
And she took me up
to the daughter's bedroom.

909
00:59:21,639 --> 00:59:24,040
The daughter's
standing there...

910
00:59:26,109 --> 00:59:29,045
Letting us know
she can't stand us.

911
00:59:30,914 --> 00:59:32,248
I stopped at the doorway.

912
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,884
My wife came over here.

913
00:59:34,886 --> 00:59:38,320
My wife addressed me.

914
00:59:38,322 --> 00:59:43,793
"Have you ever seen
such filth in all your life?"

915
00:59:43,795 --> 00:59:46,328
I said, "No, I haven't,
your honor."

916
00:59:51,368 --> 00:59:52,835
My wife said,

917
00:59:52,837 --> 00:59:55,871
"Go to your bathroom,

918
00:59:55,873 --> 00:59:59,542
"pick up
the bathroom scale... yours.

919
00:59:59,544 --> 01:00:01,243
"It's on the floor.

920
01:00:01,245 --> 01:00:03,245
"With two hands.

921
01:00:03,247 --> 01:00:04,613
"Bring it in here.

922
01:00:04,615 --> 01:00:07,516
Set it down face up."

923
01:00:08,985 --> 01:00:11,020
Daughter came back with it.

924
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:20,596
My wife said, "Now,
bring that sock over here.

925
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:25,601
"Put it on the scale.

926
01:00:25,603 --> 01:00:28,471
How much does it weigh?"

927
01:00:28,473 --> 01:00:30,806
"The needle hardly moved."

928
01:00:30,808 --> 01:00:34,410
"Then why can't you
pick it up?"

929
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:49,725
Then the daughter said,
"I didn't ask to be born!"

930
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:52,661
And I just got so mad.

931
01:00:52,663 --> 01:00:54,997
I thought
of three things to say,

932
01:00:54,999 --> 01:00:59,401
but none of them would
allow me entry into heaven.

933
01:01:03,907 --> 01:01:09,111
And my wife, in...

934
01:01:09,113 --> 01:01:11,347
Time,

935
01:01:11,349 --> 01:01:15,184
said something
that made me jealous

936
01:01:15,186 --> 01:01:20,556
of her intelligence
and quickness,

937
01:01:20,558 --> 01:01:22,491
'cause the daughter said,

938
01:01:22,493 --> 01:01:24,326
"I didn't ask to be born!"

939
01:01:24,380 --> 01:01:25,157
And my wife said,

940
01:01:25,158 --> 01:01:28,659
"And you're not
what we asked for."

941
01:01:38,204 --> 01:01:40,704
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

942
01:01:40,707 --> 01:02:25,343
