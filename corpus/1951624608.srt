1
00:00:33,566 --> 00:00:35,227
<i>In the city, you're nothing...</i>

2
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,836
<i>... unless you're part of something</i>
<i>better than yourself.</i>

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:42,031
<i>I joined a gang</i>
<i>when I was 10 years old.</i>

4
00:00:42,242 --> 00:00:44,403
<i>I loved being a gangster.</i>

5
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:47,136
<i>I loved my barrio.</i>

6
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:50,373
<i>Maybe that's why I became a cop.</i>

7
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:53,484
<i>With that power</i>
<i>came responsibility.</i>

8
00:00:53,686 --> 00:00:57,144
<i>With responsibility</i>
<i>came opportunity.</i>

9
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,656
<i>And with opportunity</i>
<i>came corruption.</i>

10
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,691
<i>It was like the plague.</i>

11
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,194
<i>Everybody got sick.</i>

12
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,817
Hold up, Salim. Chill out.
There's somebody coming.

13
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:31,881
There's nothing to see out here, sir.
Go back inside.

14
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:36,359
Salim, kick back, homey.

15
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:40,456
You want a bullet in your head too?

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,131
Oh, you don't fucking hear me?
I'm gonna shoot you in your face.

17
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:47,567
- In the motherfucking head.
- Salim, damn it. Salim!

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,945
- Undercover.
- Undercover.

19
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,913
- Undercover!
- Undercover!

20
00:02:16,402 --> 00:02:19,735
<i>I didn't give a fuck</i>
<i>about killing two gangsters.</i>

21
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:22,669
<i>That was our mission.</i>
<i>They were our quota.</i>

22
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:25,610
<i>Those were our orders.</i>

23
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:28,909
<i>I believed in what I did.</i>

24
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:32,642
<i>I believed in protecting the people</i>
<i>from the dirt on the streets.</i>

25
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:37,987
<i>I believed there was a difference</i>
<i>between us and them.</i>

26
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,454
<i>But man or animal...</i>

27
00:02:40,927 --> 00:02:44,124
<i>... there are some lines</i>
<i>we should not cross...</i>

28
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:48,325
<i>... and my partner killed</i>
<i>an innocent man.</i>

29
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:50,298
<i>Still...</i>

30
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,630
<i>... I never thought I'd be a rat.</i>

31
00:03:13,393 --> 00:03:15,657
<i>I love my partner like a brother.</i>

32
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,564
<i>And I love my unit</i>
<i>like my own family.</i>

33
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,960
<i>But after that night, I had changed.</i>

34
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,298
<i>I didn't have a choice.</i>

35
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,842
<i>My conscience</i>
<i>was taking care of that.</i>

36
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,214
I know. I know it's a cliché.

37
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:39,852
- But they taste so good. Want one?
- Why you rolling up on me at my crib?

38
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:43,544
I think it's best
we talk in person, so hop in.

39
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,356
We need something else.

40
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,827
We need your partner
to corroborate your testimony.

41
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:55,557
- No, he ain't gonna roll.
- We need you to talk to him.

42
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,066
Look, I'll take a poly,
do whatever it takes.

43
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,239
Won't fly in court. You know that.

44
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,175
One more finger-pointing rat will.

45
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:05,835
Some finger-pointing...

46
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,570
...a little name-calling.
Should do the trick.

47
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:12,710
Some reason you don't
want him coming in?

48
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:15,549
He knows what you're doing...

49
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,746
...maybe he'll change his mind.

50
00:04:25,064 --> 00:04:27,396
Today's the day.

51
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:39,240
<i>Guys like me</i>
<i>are what we always were:</i>

52
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:41,276
<i>Expendable.</i>

53
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:06,825
Elijah, did you clean
your room this morning?

54
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,694
- No.
- Go clean it.

55
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,870
- Okay.
- All right. Thank you.

56
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:30,850
Gotta go.

57
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:40,497
My son. Motherfucking superhero.
Catch any bad guys lately?

58
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,903
- <i>Early tomorrow morning...</i>
- What's this?

59
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:49,632
<i>... we will take the children to the</i>
<i>forest and leave them there to die.</i>

60
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:54,205
Turn that shit off. Baby.

61
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:58,847
- Yeah?
- His mama's coming to pick him up.

62
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:00,541
- That bitch?
- Daddy, don't go.

63
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,744
Hope she gonna be
on time this time.

64
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,789
Don't forget your lunch.

65
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:23,237
Fucking asshole.

66
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,273
Can I suck your dick,
Officer Sancho?

67
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:31,712
Go put your uniform on.
Come on, dog.

68
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,546
Why you think we gotta
bitch up to them IA fucks?

69
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:37,154
Fifty to life a good enough reason?

70
00:07:37,356 --> 00:07:39,824
Not to wear them fag suits.

71
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,456
You really want me to wear that?

72
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,893
I ain't getting in that ride with
you looking like that, man.

73
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,432
I ain't doing it.

74
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:54,697
I'd take a bullet for you,
cuz, but this shit?

75
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:09,785
Punk-ass motherfucker.

76
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,356
You owe me, cuz. You heard me?

77
00:08:28,307 --> 00:08:29,638
Excuse me, sir?

78
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,818
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

79
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:46,386
<i>Seeing ghosts again, homey?</i>

80
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:50,454
A lot of ghosts in this fucking town.

81
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,664
Better check yourself today.

82
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:55,463
They'll Section Eight your ass.

83
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,567
What time they wanna
see you today?

84
00:09:01,807 --> 00:09:04,367
- Six p.m.
- Yeah, me too.

85
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,204
I hope it don't take too long.

86
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:08,811
Gotta make me some money today.

87
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,215
Get me some rims
and a motherfucking Rolex.

88
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:15,352
Adel, your nametag's
on upside down...

89
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,417
...and you got a fucking
diamond in your ear.

90
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,189
I look good, though. Hear me?

91
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:37,403
So, cuz, one of them street ho's...

92
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,340
...hands over 40 quarters
to her pimp.

93
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:42,776
Pimp says, "Quarters, girl?

94
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:45,712
Which one of them niggas
paid you in quarters?"

95
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,410
Ho says, "Well, all of them,
they all done paid in quarters.

96
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:51,817
One at a time."

97
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:59,092
Just wanna make it through this day.
That's all I wanna do.

98
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,400
I just wanna stick my dick
in something.

99
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,195
You'd fuck a donkey
if you had the chance.

100
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:05,927
That's not very nice.

101
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:12,873
What's up, ladies?

102
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,747
You ever have a black and blue?

103
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,615
- You're a pig.
- Get out of here.

104
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,911
Go on, don't be mad.
We can make it, baby.

105
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,487
She just ran that light.
Crazy-ass bitch.

106
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,056
I should have
gave that bitch a ticket.

107
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:30,086
Nasty-ass trick-ass bitch.

108
00:10:38,037 --> 00:10:39,629
What do we got here?

109
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,740
Oh, these motherfuckers are lost.

110
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,109
I'm sorry, we're lost.

111
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:47,676
You shouldn't be down here.
You don't belong here.

112
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:49,505
- Roll your window up.
- Directions?

113
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:52,912
Don't even think of helping them,
hear me?

114
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,680
Okay. Remember what I said,
it's a mistake.

115
00:11:02,361 --> 00:11:04,591
- Just tell them...
- How can I help you, ma'am?

116
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:06,628
- What?
- I'm sorry?

117
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,596
- How can I help you?
- I'm having trouble with his accent.

118
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,600
- I'm sorry... No, Salim, come on.
- Looking for a restaurant.

119
00:11:12,805 --> 00:11:14,466
- The address...
- Oh, shit, nigga.

120
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,972
- Sir, please exit the vehicle.
- Son of a bitch.

121
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,167
- What?
- Sir, please exit the vehicle.

122
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:22,313
Oh, you can't understand
my nigger accent either?

123
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,312
Get your punk ass
out the car, bitch.

124
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,142
Put your hands on the hood.

125
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,116
Hurry up, motherfucker.
Put your hands on the hood.

126
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,186
I'm not fucking with you.

127
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,425
Face down.
Don't be eyeing me and shit.

128
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,788
What is this? You don't need that shit.
Stay still, motherfucker.

129
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:41,864
What the fuck is this?
What you got in there?

130
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:44,962
You don't need that shit.
Don't move till I say move.

131
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:48,503
- Yes, sir.
- Don't "yes, sir" me. Just stay still.

132
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,170
Look at this.

133
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,139
All the bells and whistles.

134
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:03,511
Put your hands on the ceiling.
Put your hands on the ceiling.

135
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,985
What is that, seat warmers?
You got them too in there?

136
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,490
Come on, let me see.

137
00:12:11,297 --> 00:12:13,663
Bet you like to take it
to the grocery store, huh?

138
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,168
Spread your leg.

139
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:20,499
Oh, shit, I know what this is.

140
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,770
I love the vehicle. You like it?

141
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,404
Can l...?

142
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,211
Do you like the motherfucking
$65,000 vehicle?

143
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,186
- Yes. Yes, I like it.
- All right, then. Get in it and drive off.

144
00:12:39,892 --> 00:12:43,794
Hurry up, sir.
Ain't got all day in this motherfucker.

145
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:48,927
Go straight under the bridge,
there will be an on-ramp.

146
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:52,763
- Go ahead and hop on the freeway...
- Zero to 60 in eight seconds. Let's see.

147
00:12:53,038 --> 00:12:55,700
Go ahead, I'm gonna
close my eyes. I'm not looking.

148
00:12:58,144 --> 00:13:00,271
<i>Adiós</i>, amigo.

149
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:04,307
I hate white people.

150
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,252
Can we go now?

151
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,616
Hey, he was disrespecting you, cuz.
Liberal prick.

152

- They were Charlie. You know it.
- And you my motherfucking homey.

00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,728
Got to soldier up, cuz.

Hey, look at this. Look at this.
It says "lawyer."

155
00:13:20,699 --> 00:13:22,564
Look at all them.
Fifty names in there.

156
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,770
You know he was
into some dirty shit.

157
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,799
Craig Humphrey.

158
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:30,305
What kind of name is that for a nigga?
Humphrey.

159
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:08,880
Looking good, ladies.

160

Come on, none of this.

166
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,387
All right, let's get going.

167
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,160
- Good luck today.
- Thanks, dog. I appreciate that.

168
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,236
- After you.
- Thank you, baby.

169
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:38,173
Before we get going...

170
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:41,377
...Officer Wallace
has something to share.

171
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,844
Tell your fellow officers
about your experience.

172
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,641
Yes, sir.

173
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:49,546
I was approaching
a somewhat hostile crowd...

174
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,049
<i>... surrounding a drive-by</i>
<i>shooting victim.</i>

175
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,729
<i>I noticed that the victim, some</i>
<i>gangbanger known as Little Angel...</i>

176
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,521
<i>... had his brains falling out.</i>

177
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,860
Where were you guys?
What do we pay you for?

178
00:15:03,435 --> 00:15:07,064
And the mother was trying
to put the brains back in.

179
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,739
But the more she tried...

180
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:12,206
...the more they kept falling out.

181
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,642
It was like spaghetti or something.

182
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,678
Then she said,
"No wonder people kill cops."

183
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:31,524
Nobody in here feels worse for her
than Officer Wallace. Is that right?

184
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:33,721
Yes, sir.

185
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,562
- That isn't why people kill cops, is it?
- No, sir.

186
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,362
Why do people kill cops, Wallace?

187
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:42,165
Sir, because they
see us as the enemy.

188
00:15:42,408 --> 00:15:44,876
- Because they distrust us.
- No.

189
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,139
It's because those people...

190
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,576
...are not people at all.

191
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,380
What's the difference between
us and them, Wallace?

192
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,255
- I don't know.
- Think about it.

193
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,924
- Officer Sancho?
- Sir.

194
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,253
- What do we do here?
- Sir, we fight fire with fire.

195
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,698
There's a war out there
on the streets.

196
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:10,965
And the blood
on that poor mother's hands...

197
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,395
...is blood on all of our hands.

198
00:16:14,773 --> 00:16:18,971
Now, you go out there today
and knock heads with the enemy.

199
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,606
Make sure...

200
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:26,641
...the letters P-O-L-l-C-E is branded
on the head of every gangbanger...

201
00:16:26,852 --> 00:16:29,616
...like a cowboy's branding iron.

202
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,784
Remember, you are the elite.

203
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,084
The chosen few.

204
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,758
One felon a day
is all you need to do.

205
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:46,165
Dismissed.

206
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,429
Fellas?

207
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,647
That's a sweet little story
you told there, rookie.

208
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,113
- Shut up, nigga.
- You know?

209
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,378
- You serious?
- Don't push my baton, nigga.

210
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:05,113
Who the fuck you pushing, bitch?

211
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,354
You're a rookie.
Don't forget that shit, motherfucker.

212
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:12,996
- Why you messing with him, anyway?
- Trying to heat the young kids up.

213
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,563
Know what I mean?

214
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,461
Bye, Salim.

215
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:23,807
Lieutenant, give us a minute,
will you?

216
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:26,341
- Sure.
- Thanks.

217
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:47,721
So...

218
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,325
...today is the day.

219
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,235
I can't tell you how much faith
I have in you two.

220
00:17:56,975 --> 00:18:01,071
- Thank you, sir.
- You know how these things go.

221
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,748
Somebody on the outside
thinks they can do our job better.

222
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,085
They get upset
because we play ball.

223
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,018
But as long as crime
keeps going down...

224
00:18:12,224 --> 00:18:14,522
...all we gotta do is ride it out.

225
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,088
And ride it out
is what we're gonna do.

226
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,728
- You can count on us, sir.
- Good.

227
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,334
You okay, Armando?

228
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,262
A little nervous, sir.

229
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:31,965
Look, I know only the best intentions
were behind what happened that day.

230
00:18:33,812 --> 00:18:35,575
Mistakes happen in the fog of war.

231
00:18:35,981 --> 00:18:38,040
You're a good man.

232
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,718
The world is a bad place.

233
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,279
You do the best you can
in a bad place.

234
00:18:45,591 --> 00:18:48,059
- Remember that.
- Yes, sir.

235
00:18:49,161 --> 00:18:50,753
Last week...

236
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,757
...more third-strikers
were put away by us...

237
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,797
...than any other division in the city.

238
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,397
Be proud.

239
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:00,732
Walk tall.

240
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,783
I'll take care of you.

241
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:15,285
Don't worry.

242
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,148
Yes, sir.

243
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,524
A man said:

244
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:26,687
"Someday a real rain's gonna come
and wash all the scum off the street."

245
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,093
Only, it don't rain in the desert...

246
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:31,963
...so we gotta do all
the scum-washing ourselves.

247
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,973
Nigga better get a life vest.

248
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:40,773
- Little hair of the dog?
- I'm a drunk. I'm always thirsty.

249
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,879
- See you in a second.
- Cool.

250
00:19:43,081 --> 00:19:44,105
Right.

251
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:51,822
- <i>Yo, captain.</i>
- Yeah.

252
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,888
<i>So how are the kids?</i>

253
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:56,720
<i>Bury them under</i>
<i>the fucking freeway.</i>

254
00:19:56,962 --> 00:20:00,056
- <i>What about the coke?</i>
- <i>Don't worry, you'll get yours.</i>

255
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:04,224
<i>Yeah, man, pleasure</i>
<i>doing business with you.</i>

256
00:20:13,579 --> 00:20:16,810
- What's happening?
- You know the drill. Come on.

257
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,808
Are we supposed to be
wearing a wire?

258
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,492
Bet this reminds you
of Valentine's Day...

259
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,661
...when your father would
make love to you.

260
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:31,590
- Quit your bitching, pussy.
- Fuck you.

261
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:33,765
You got a problem with it?
Talk to the man.

262
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:34,988
Come on.

263
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,901
What time are you guys meeting IA?

264
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,704
- 1800.
- What did the captain tell you?

265
00:20:48,647 --> 00:20:51,480
He said to stay away from
corrupt motherfuckers like you.

266
00:20:53,318 --> 00:20:54,717
Got your stories straight?

267
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:58,445
We in the loop. Don't worry about us.
We know what's happening, you know?

268
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:01,353
So, what do you got planned
for the rest of the day?

269
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,391
Same old, same old.

270
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,995
Got a little time for
a little ring-a-ding, then?

271
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,391
For sure.

272
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:13,634
I don't think so.

273
00:21:20,812 --> 00:21:24,543
Do you know
the definition of opportunity?

274
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:30,087
No?

275
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:35,926
Opportunity: A favorable
juncture of circumstances.

276
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,255
Or, let's see,
another one would be...

277
00:21:39,431 --> 00:21:43,925
...if you like, a good chance
for advancement of progress.

278
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,233
You understand that?

279
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,530
Opportunity:

280
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:51,607
Advancement of fucking progress.

281
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,477
Lieutenant?

282
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:01,179
Excuse me.

283
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,089
Yeah.

284
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:08,149
Yeah.

285
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,655
All right, good.

286
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:14,358
- Perfect.
- "I don't think so," motherfucker?

287
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,195
Embarrass me in front
of the lieutenant like that?

288
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,960
Hey, don't think for us.

289
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:21,497
What the fuck we doing here?
What we doing?

290
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,368
All right. Okay.

291
00:22:24,976 --> 00:22:26,603
Try me.

292
00:22:31,216 --> 00:22:32,706
Well...

293
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:36,850
...what do you think?
- We're in.

294
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:45,591
All right.
That's what I like to see, kid.

295
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:49,725
- Well, to good living.
- That's what I'm talking about.

296
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:51,596
Cheers.

297
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:56,863
Now, here's the deal.

298
00:22:57,075 --> 00:23:01,205
There's a guy named Brax
who's been reaching out to us.

299
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:04,108
I know Brax. That's Damian Baine's
right-hand man.

300
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,340
<i>Nigga owns</i>
<i>every nightclub in town.</i>

301
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,152
Well, he's got some scam
that he's in a real hurry to get done.

302
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,815
- You guys cool with that?
- Cool.

303
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:18,256
I can set up a meeting between you
and him at this Mexican joint, all right?

304
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:23,228
Now, there's 13 keys...

305
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,561
...of the most pure shit
you ever seen...

306
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,138
...sitting downtown in Evidence
with your names written all over it.

307
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,872
We get these 13 keys to Baine...

308
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:34,177
...who's responsible
for getting it back?

309
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,042
Who the fuck do you think?

310
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,909
I almost forgot, shit.

311
00:23:44,055 --> 00:23:45,955
I got you guys...

312
00:23:46,191 --> 00:23:48,216
...courtside seats
to the playoffs tonight.

313
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,362
- What?
- So make it quick at IA, understand?

314
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,861
- You guys are gonna have fun.
- That's what's up.

315
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,590
You know what I mean?

316
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,937
You guys enjoy the game.

317
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,572
Nigga, I've never been
courtside to the playoffs before.

318
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:16,311
What? I ain't never even
been to the playoffs before, shit.

319
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:20,321
Why would that cheap motherfucker
give us free tickets to the playoffs?

320
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:22,150
I don't know.

321
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,488
But it says something that he's coming
to us and not that wetback.

322
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,322
Know what I mean?

323
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,799
Man, it's just a fucking game,
that's all it is.

324
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,994
Hey, don't stick your dick
in the gift horse's mouth.

325
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,503
All right? It means something.
You heard me?

326
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:39,642
Sir. Today's the day, my nigga.

327
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:43,336
We on the come up.
We coming up.

328
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,241
I don't like it, Salim.

329
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,148
Take a leg up when you get it, shit.

330
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:52,652
Why in the hell would anybody
give us a leg up?

331
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:54,791
- To show trust in us.
- Trust in us.

332
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:57,757
Hey, man, we get in with Baine,
we get rich. Hear me?

333
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,123
Pretty quick to get on that
Baine program.

334
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:02,596
Don't hate the player,
hate the game, cuz.

335
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:04,530
You know the deal.

336
00:25:37,669 --> 00:25:39,136
You're Officer Sancho?

337
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:42,999
Do I look Mexican? It's my partner.

338
00:25:43,909 --> 00:25:46,707
- Your badge is upside down.
- It's been one of them mornings.

339
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,847
- Hey, beautiful.
- Officer Sancho?

340
00:25:50,916 --> 00:25:52,213
Yeah.

341
00:25:54,085 --> 00:25:57,714
- Something wrong, officer?
- Yo, cuz, we in a hurry.

342
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,389
Yeah, well, I'm not.

343
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,583
So give me a minute while I call
the requesting judge, okay?

344
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,819
Sir? Sir.

345
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:13,435
Listen, we're late,
our job's on the line.

346
00:26:13,638 --> 00:26:15,663
We really need to get going.

347
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,372
You wouldn't want another
dealer on the street...

348
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,602
...if we're fucking late, would you?

349
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,114
Motherfucking candy store.

350
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,866
Toxicology was here earlier...

351
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,098
...ran a test sample,
so no funny stuff.

352
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,707
No funny stuff.

353
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,970
You. Sign that.

354
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,708
Had more than a few pieces
of evidence disappear...

355
00:27:01,186 --> 00:27:03,245
...after being checked out
by your division.

356
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,650
Zip that up. This gets back by 5.

357
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:13,227
- I'll take that.
- Follow procedure, officers, 5:00.

358
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,764
What the fuck
was that shit about back there?

359
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:24,066
- What?
- My name on the slip, that's what.

360
00:27:24,275 --> 00:27:26,300
- What name you want?
- How about your own?

361
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:29,446
- Why mine, bitch?
- Well, it's your fucking gig, ain't it?

362
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:32,411
Oh, no, fuck that. We partners, man.
We in this together.

363
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:34,278
As always.

364
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,143
You got something to say? Say it.

365
00:27:37,555 --> 00:27:39,523
Fuck it. Say it, motherfucker.

366
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,252
Yeah, I thought so.

367
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:17,223
Watch my back, cuz,
while I check this nigga.

368
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:25,230
Hey, what's up, bro?

369
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,961
Same old, same old.

370
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,371
Salim Adel.

371
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:37,081
You in here sorting through
the little table full of niggas?

372
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:41,341
What you looking for? You ain't come
in here to do the black man harm?

373
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,651
- Friendlies in blue, that's all.
- Oh, yeah?

374
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:48,053
Salim Adel
in a fucking faggot suit.

375
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,020
And your mother, how is she?

376
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,855
Not very well, not very well.

377
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,857
I am sorry.

378
00:28:54,099 --> 00:28:56,499
You ain't the only one
sucking dick, selling rock.

379
00:28:56,868 --> 00:28:58,995
- Shut the fuck up, nigga.
- What?

380
00:28:59,204 --> 00:29:01,502
Hey, there ain't gonna
be no disrespect.

381
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,037
No disrespecting.

382
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:07,771
I ain't disrespecting you, cuz. We
played football together, remember?

383
00:29:08,012 --> 00:29:09,411
Used to run with the same set.

384
00:29:09,614 --> 00:29:13,345
Don't talk to me about no fucking
football, nigga. I'm a fucking OG.

385
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,951
I'm a ghetto superstar
and an international pimp.

386
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,554
I got fans all over
the fucking world, nigga.

387
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,417
True as a bullet in a pig's head.

388
00:29:20,658 --> 00:29:22,922
Look, you need a busboy...

389
00:29:23,128 --> 00:29:27,895
...to clean up all this fucking trash
in front of this place.

390
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:31,429
No, brother, everybody's got to eat.

391
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:32,761
If you say so.

392
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,767
Man, go into the car, nigga.
You, go to the car.

393
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,375
Yeah, I wanna talk
to this nigga by myself.

394
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:41,537
Everybody, get the fuck
out of here, matter of fact.

395
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:44,474
- See this shit?
- What the fuck is this?

396
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:46,411
That's one of them new joints too.

397
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,054
A Mark Xll or some shit.
Got all the bells and whistles.

398
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,945
High connectivity and shit.

399
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,751
So you get what you told?

400
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,427
- Thirteen.
- Let me see it.

401
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,623
No, cuz, not here.

402
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:02,766
Keeping it safe
until we know what we're doing.

403
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:06,761
You're a smart motherfucker, huh?

404
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,771
Hey, man, I'm in a big motherfucking
hurry, and I heard that you was too.

405
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,500
- So, what's the dealio?
- Tell you what the deal is.

406
00:30:13,711 --> 00:30:17,613
You gonna be a rich fucker if you
shut your smart motherfucking mouth.

407
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,182
If you don't shut your
smart motherfucking mouth...

408
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,979
...l'm gonna walk out
on your punk ass.

409
00:30:23,888 --> 00:30:25,480
All right, man. When and where?

410
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:27,514
Come to the club.

411
00:30:27,725 --> 00:30:30,785
In the back. And bring the shit.

412
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,190
Today is the day, nigga.

413
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,792
You ain't gonna believe
this shit, cuz.

414
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:38,025
What? We're supposed to
go to Baine's crib...

415
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:39,601
...with the bricks in our hand?

416
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,069
Don't start getting
all paranoid on me.

417
00:30:42,307 --> 00:30:44,468
We ain't giving them shit.
Staying in the car.

418
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,578
They said to bring the shit in.
Why we ain't gonna bring the shit in?

419
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:50,512
Baine got his drugs...

420
00:30:50,715 --> 00:30:53,081
...lieutenant got his hands clean
for the murders.

421
00:30:53,318 --> 00:30:56,151
There's no way we could
turn him in to IA...

422
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,821
...if we're both fucking dead.

423
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:01,321
What the fuck did you just say?

424
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,957
What the fuck you thinking
about saying to IA?

425
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:09,227
What the fuck you thinking
about telling IA, man?

426
00:31:09,434 --> 00:31:11,834
- Nothing.
- You damn right, nothing.

427
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:15,005
Better check yourself for that shit.

428
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:21,804
What the fuck you looking
at me like that for?

429
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,105
What, nigga?

430
00:31:24,782 --> 00:31:27,216
Why the fuck you be
disrespecting my friends?

431
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,319
They ain't your friends, nigga.
Leave the shit in the car.

432
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:32,489
Hey, hey, hey. Listen<i>...</i>

433
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:36,553
You gotta stop believing the hype.

434
00:31:37,161 --> 00:31:39,721
Thinking that there's some
gang war out here and shit.

435
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:42,161
Well, there ain't. It's done.

436
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,495
Everybody's so rich off the narco,
they ain't mad-dogging anymore.

437
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,605
We the only gang that's left.

438
00:31:50,808 --> 00:31:54,039
So wise up, nigga. Wise up.

439
00:31:57,882 --> 00:31:59,509
You know, he invited us to Vegas.

440
00:32:00,618 --> 00:32:04,850
Hear me? But he said,
"Don't come wearing your blues.

441
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:08,548
Because you ain't gonna get
your nut sack sucked that way."

442
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,695
We go see Baine,
the shit's staying in the car.

443
00:32:11,896 --> 00:32:15,093
Let's not get jumped in, man.
This is our time now.

444
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,394
No.

445
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,799
The shit's staying in the car.

446
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,473
We hook up with Baine,
we're on top of the pile, man.

447
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:29,908
I wanna go to Vegas.
I wanna get my nut sack sucked.

448
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:33,181
I know you wanna get
your nut sack sucked.

449
00:32:36,254 --> 00:32:38,916
How many nuts you think
a bitch can keep in her mouth?

450
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,292
Come on, man. Ho's got to eat too.

451
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,259
Don't look at me like that.
Ever seen me go off?

452
00:32:46,831 --> 00:32:47,991
I only got but two.

453
00:32:48,232 --> 00:32:50,894
Shit, not counting the one
in your asshole, that's three.

454
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:54,560
That's <i>tres.</i> How do you say that?

455
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,308
"Motherfuckos." You shit pesos.

456
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:05,109
That's all I'm talking about.
Vegas. Vegas, nigga.

457
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:10,349
The shit stays in the car. I don't give
a fuck how many nuts you get sucked.

458
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:24,093
I don't know how
to make it work. Keep that.

459
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:26,270
That shit ain't for niggas.

460
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:30,533
What's up?
You all dressed up, huh?

461
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:33,971
Are those real blue contacts?

462
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,875
Please, that real gold paint
on that bullshit-ass chain?

463
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,381
Don't fuck with Jesus.

464
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,848
Yeah, right.

465
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,949
Yo.

466
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:48,825
This is Brax. I'm out here with them.

467
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,551
We waiting for my man.
He got what we need.

468
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:56,962
We're good to go.

469
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,549
Armando Sancho.

470
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,090
For a long time I've heard
about the myth...

471
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,560
...today I meet the legend.

472
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,597
Mal Creado gang, right?
Back in the day.

473
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:05,057
Yep.

474
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:08,431
Yeah, some men talk the talk...

475
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,402
...but you walk the walk.

476
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:12,575
Salim Adel.

477
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,969
What am I seeing on the West Coast?

478
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:18,612
My motherfucking homey.

479
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,216
Thirteen keys of righteous dope.

480
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:27,148
Hey, girl.

481
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,581
Dancing is done.

482
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:31,421
If I was selling your pussy,
I'd be rich already.

483
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:35,222
Bad men carry python snakes, see?

484
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,892
Careful, she bites.

485
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:38,125
I bite too.

486
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:40,068
Go on, get out of here.

487
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:41,898
Yo.

488
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,664
Salim Adel.

489
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:47,271
You talk that loud again,
I'll assume you're an informer.

490
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:50,845
And informers get killed.
I have an opportunity for you.

491
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:54,575
There are some Canadian
Hell's Angels down at the beach.

492
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:58,915
<i>They are sitting on hundreds and</i>
<i>thousands of dollars. Maybe more.</i>

493
00:35:59,123 --> 00:36:00,886
<i>They think they're big time.</i>

494
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,123
But crime is easy...

495
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,656
<i>... when you don't fit the profile.</i>

496
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,525
<i>They bring the chronic down</i>
<i>from Canada, flip the shit into coke.</i>

497
00:36:10,735 --> 00:36:12,532
<i>Buy all the dope in town...</i>

498
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:14,634
<i>... sending the prices sky-high.</i>

499
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,906
I have a huge problem with that.

500
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,435
<i>They're idiots.</i>

501
00:36:20,478 --> 00:36:23,038
<i>They will buy coke</i>
<i>from anyone half-connected...</i>

502
00:36:23,247 --> 00:36:26,978
<i>... and stupid enough to walk up</i>
<i>to the door and say, "Nantucket."</i>

503
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,776
Nantucket.

504
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,715
<i>They think this a vacation...</i>

505
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:34,783
<i>... but you don't ruin my business</i>
<i>on a vacation.</i>

506
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:37,187
<i>And a nigga's never on vacation...</i>

507
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:43,027
<i>... trust me when I tell you, because</i>
<i>a nigga always fits the profile.</i>

508
00:36:44,502 --> 00:36:45,526
<i>Yeah.</i>

509
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:47,431
<i>Do you know what a "jux" is?</i>

510
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:49,328
- Police.
- Don't move.

511
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,007
- Put them up.
- Make me do it.

512
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:54,806
Yeah, that's right. Thirteen keys.

513
00:36:59,083 --> 00:37:02,143
So we use the drugs to get the money
and keep both?

514
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:05,379
- Sounds pretty easy.
- lf it's so easy...

515
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:07,820
...why don't you just do it yourself?

516
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,552
I don't want any problems
with the Hell's Angels.

517
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,559
But if you make it look like a bust,
real pig action, cherry top popping...

518
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,962
...then we're all happy.
And the whole community is happy.

519
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,999
- Rodriguez and Sayed?
- No.

520
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:25,971
The lieutenant told me you guys
were the best for the job.

521
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,009
This has to happen right now.

522
00:37:28,212 --> 00:37:30,373
These guys are leaving
for Vancouver tonight.

523
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,378
This has to happen right now.

524
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,177
Lieutenant made the call already.

525
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:38,246
They said they coming over
in about an hour.

526
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:39,750
What we getting paid?

527
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,983
We split the loot three ways.

528
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:46,291
Me, you...

529
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:48,892
...and me again.

530
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,762
Sound fair?

531
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,649
Hey, hey, hey. Relax, man, relax.

532
00:38:14,925 --> 00:38:16,984
We got the fucking job, cuz.
We got the job.

533
00:38:17,194 --> 00:38:18,889
What did I say?

534
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,929
- What did I fucking say?
- You said, "What did I say." Hey.

535
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,963
You said,
"Leave the shit in the car."

536
00:38:24,168 --> 00:38:26,728
But you was wrong, man.
They didn't fucking jack us...

537
00:38:26,937 --> 00:38:28,768
...they hired us.

538
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:34,242
We're gonna go back to the lieutenant
and tell him, "No fucking way."

539
00:38:34,445 --> 00:38:38,108
We're gonna go to our IA meeting,
and then we're gonna go home.

540
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,580
And we're gonna survive.

541
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:43,016
You're scared.

542
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,688
I've never seen you scared before.

543
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,624
Yeah, maybe you should be too.

544
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,419
You don't think I know what's up?

545
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:53,922
All I know is they wanna get rich...

546
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:57,464
...I wanna get rich,
and I know you wanna get rich.

547
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,365
I'll tell you what you get.

548
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,607
You get got as soon as you
walk in that door.

549
00:39:06,744 --> 00:39:09,372
If they wanted to kill us,
they'd have done it already.

550
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:12,446
They'd have done it
at the motherfucking taco stand.

551
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,182
Man, you gotta chill
with the mind-fuck, cuz.

552
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,955
Your punk ass can't handle
the motherfucking pressure.

553
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,095
Now, get this
motherfucking gun off me.

554
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:32,827
What the fuck is wrong with you?

555
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:40,972
I mean, listen to me, man.
I'm talking hundreds of thousands.

556
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:42,475
Maybe even more.

557
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:44,374
I know you can use
some real money...

558
00:39:44,582 --> 00:39:48,348
...instead of dealing with all this
little fucking weaselly shit.

559
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,885
What, you think I'm a dumb nigga
just because I wanna buy shit?

560
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,689
Doesn't matter
what you spend it on.

561
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,487
We both want it.

562
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,664
Shit, we both need it.

563
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,659
Fuck it.

564
00:40:04,869 --> 00:40:06,769
We ain't got nothing
better else to do.

565
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,735
What we got, huh?
Not a motherfucking thing.

566
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:17,244
Man, we do this one gig,
this one motherfucking hit...

567
00:40:17,448 --> 00:40:19,541
...nigga, we set for life,
you heard me?

568
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:31,292
I ain't gonna shoot anybody.

569
00:40:32,196 --> 00:40:34,096
We go in there clean...

570
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:37,859
...we take the money
and we walk the fuck out.

571
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,203
Hey, I ain't looking
for no battle neither.

572
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:47,104
So from here on out,
what I say goes.

573
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:49,736
- You got it?
- Yes, sir, master.

574
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:51,039
Shit.

575
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:55,580
You say that shit,
or I'll walk out this fucking door.

576
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,923
What you say go.

577
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,095
What you say go.

578
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,930
What you say go, motherfucker.

579
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:10,999
My nigga.

580
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:17,468
- Maybe today's the day after all.
- Good.

581
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:20,004
Let's go punk down
the motherfucker.

582
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:53,208
Thanks for coming, captain.
We appreciate your time.

583
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:55,173
Whatever I can do to help.

584
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:05,951
- Ready, gentlemen?
- Ready.

585
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:12,796
You testified that the two young men
killed by your officers...

586
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:15,022
...were both gang members?
- Yes.

587
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,632
The older man your officers shot
outside the bar...

588
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,201
...you said he was intoxicated
and confrontational?

589
00:42:20,404 --> 00:42:23,202
He reached into his pocket
for what they thought was a gun.

590
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,465
The safety of my men is
my first priority.

591
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:28,008
I thought it was
to serve and protect.

592
00:42:28,245 --> 00:42:30,839
- My men are soldiers.
- Soldiers kill people, captain.

593
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:32,780
Cops help people.

594
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:35,417
Until Officers Sancho and Adel
were hired by me...

595
00:42:35,619 --> 00:42:38,315
...the only light they saw was
the flash from a gun.

596
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:41,150
If you politicize this event
and ruin their lives...

597
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:43,087
The only lives we're
concerned with...

598
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,296
...are the families of the men
who lost their lives that night.

599
00:42:46,597 --> 00:42:49,498
That's why you'll never understand
what it means to be a cop.

600
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,692
They said Bay Street.
Why we at the beach?

601
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,098
Fucking dirty-ass hippies
freak me out, man.

602
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:57,000
Looking for somebody
stupid enough...

603
00:42:57,207 --> 00:42:59,903
...to walk up to a door with a bag
and say, "Nantucket."

604
00:43:00,144 --> 00:43:01,873
Thought that was gonna be me.

605
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,344
If this is a fucking set-up,
we're not getting shot in the head.

606
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,881
We're gonna go in
and make this jack move happen.

607
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:12,082
Who's a ruthless-ass motherfucker?
I like it.

608
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,294
Okay, you ready?

609
00:43:24,501 --> 00:43:26,230
Okay.

610
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:29,462
Now, see? Yeah.

611
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,868
That could be good.

612
00:43:33,911 --> 00:43:35,776
Good. Yeah, I'm good.

613
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:38,106
- You look good. Might take me out.
- See?

614
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:41,113
Dude, dude, what are you loo...?

615
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:42,945
Man, what are you looking at, dude?

616
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,246
Honest. Come on, man.

617
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,083
Look. Look, it's right here.

618
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:51,658
- See something you like, it's right here.
- Fuck you. You can't just pimp me out.

619
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,920
Well, get it cracking, man.

620
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,225
What? You don't like what you see
or something?

621
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,493
I won't kiss you
in front of your boyfriend.

622
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:02,000
- He's not my boyfriend, okay?
- Excuse me.

623
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:05,300
Shit, I can kiss
whoever the fuck I want.

624
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:09,302
And maybe I wanna kiss you.

625
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:12,082
Oh, is that right?

626
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:16,880
- Hey, police.
- Shit.

627
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,477
Shit.

628
00:44:19,456 --> 00:44:21,515
Hey, don't run. Don't run.

629
00:44:23,227 --> 00:44:24,592
Don't run, you motherfuckers.

630
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:26,160
I said, stop, you bitch.

631
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:29,591
- Come here. Come here.
- Don't make it hard on yourself.

632
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,199
Put me down.

633
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:33,533
What, you forgot the rules now?

634
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:35,669
You're not supposed
to fuck with the Man.

635
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,340
Shut it.

636
00:44:37,541 --> 00:44:38,838
What happens when you run?

637
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:42,478
- What's the rule? You get a beatdown.
- That's right.

638
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,272
You trying to get a beatdown?

639
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:47,450
Why you running, anyway?
What, you got something to hide?

640
00:44:47,651 --> 00:44:50,142
We run because you two
motherfuckers is too violent.

641
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,050
We run because you shoot me,
then put a gun in my hand.

642
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:54,622
Shut up. Did I ask you?

643
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,826
Hey, leave him the fuck alone, man.

644
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,358
I just caught something now.

645
00:44:58,562 --> 00:45:00,962
What we got here, lovebirds?

646
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:07,003
- Nice friends you got there.
- Yeah, well...

647
00:45:07,905 --> 00:45:11,238
...at least we ain't
a bunch of pigs, right?

648
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:14,978
Who the fuck you spitting at,
motherfucker?

649
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,146
Who the fuck you spitting at?

650
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,848
- Salim.
- Crazy little bitch.

651
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,448
Stay the fuck still.

652
00:45:21,018 --> 00:45:22,918
Salim, let her go. Come on, let's go.

653
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,815
Fucking spit on me.

654
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,489
Hey,
I'm guessing white cotton panties.

655
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:33,488
I bet you I can get you wet
in front of your boyfriend.

656
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,993
I bet you she's a cue ball.

657
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:39,066
- Nice and tasty too.
- Come on, Salim, let's get out of here.

658
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:40,998
Nigga, hold up. Hold up.

659
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:44,606
I just wanna make sure she ain't
hiding nothing underneath here.

660
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:47,571
- Don't worry, Rita, he can't touch you.
- Rita?

661
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:51,043
Is that your name, huh?
Is that your name?

662
00:45:51,648 --> 00:45:56,017
All right. Well, Rita, just think of this
as a visit to the gynecologist.

663
00:46:00,057 --> 00:46:01,581
What did I say?

664
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:05,488
Score one for the niggas in blue, huh?
White cotton undies.

665
00:46:05,729 --> 00:46:09,631
Yeah, man. Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Wait a minute, wait a minute.

666
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:12,233
I forgot. Are you cue-balled or not?

667
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,904
- Let's see up here.
- No. No, please.

668
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,604
Yep. Her stinky's bare.

669
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,308
You done?

670
00:46:28,552 --> 00:46:30,144
We done.

671
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,954
Go on, get your shit
and get the fuck out of here, girl.

672
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:40,961
Bye, baby.

673
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:44,593
Hey.

674
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,801
I'm going to kill you.

675
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:57,303
Because I am a cop killer.

676
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,749
English, motherfucker.

677
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,056
Let's cut to the chase, captain.

678
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:15,697
Do you know if any of your officers,
Sancho and Adel included...

679
00:47:15,899 --> 00:47:17,696
...were involved in criminal activity?

680
00:47:17,968 --> 00:47:19,367
No. Absolutely not.

681
00:47:30,981 --> 00:47:32,278
Okay.

682
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:37,018
Violence is a language that
people understand.

683
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,712
And sometimes,
when it's necessary<i>...</i>

684
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,052
"When it's necessary."

685
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:44,227
Oh, it sounds beautiful.

686
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:46,329
These convictions you hold...

687
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:48,862
...are far more dangerous
to the truth than to lies.

688
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:52,567
You're knee-deep in a pile of shit.

689
00:47:52,769 --> 00:47:55,237
We're all knee-deep in a pile of shit.

690
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:59,636
And it doesn't matter how high up
you think you are.

691
00:47:59,843 --> 00:48:02,243
It doesn't matter
if you can smell it yet.

692
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:05,514
It's the same pile of shit
we're all sinking in.

693
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:08,609
Don't let morality make you stupid.

694
00:48:11,054 --> 00:48:13,045
Splooge?

695
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,051
What kind of name is that
for a nigga?

696
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,696
That's the sound my dick makes
when it's slipping into your girlfriend.

697
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,889
You know, maybe you should
lay off the shit a little, officer.

698
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:26,092
Maybe you could get it up
and not have to threaten little girls.

699
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,238
- What did you just say to me?
- You heard me, coke dick.

700
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:31,571
You believe this guy?

701
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,368
Man, this is a violation
of informants' rights.

702
00:48:34,978 --> 00:48:37,037
Plus, you guys didn't even pay me
last time.

703
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:41,684
This nigga rat on his own peeps
and he wants us to be fair.

704
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:42,943
My peeps?

705
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:46,587
Baby gangsters ain't got
no morals nowadays, cuz.

706
00:48:46,823 --> 00:48:50,088
Oh, okay, so just because I'm black,
I'm a gangster?

707
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:52,262
You stupid,
ignorant, racist motherfucker.

708
00:48:52,462 --> 00:48:54,293
I ain't no gangster. You a gangster.

709
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:56,095
Shut him up.

710
00:48:56,333 --> 00:48:58,801
You feel better about yourself
with that badge on?

711
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:00,730
It's a fucking piece of plastic, yo.

712
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,203
- <i>Little name-calling should do the trick.</i>
- Man, shut him the fuck up.

713
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,072
A rat is what you are.

714
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,911
Lowest piece of shit
on the face of the earth.

715
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,172
<i>Won't fly in court. You know that.</i>

716
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:14,611
You heard me?
Why'd you get this motherfucker?

717
00:49:14,818 --> 00:49:16,649
You couldn't have picked
another nigga?

718
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:18,548
You picked
this stupid motherfucker.

719
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:21,223
A parasite is what you are,
motherfucker.

720
00:49:21,425 --> 00:49:22,983
Rat on your own fucking people.

721
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,785
This motherfucker ratted on
all you motherfuckers.

722
00:49:26,029 --> 00:49:29,089
This little punk-ass nigga here.
Splooge.

723
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:33,133
I ain't calling you Splooge no more.
I'm gonna call you "dick juice."

724
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:34,634
Fucking pay me.

725
00:49:36,006 --> 00:49:38,065
Hey, shut him the fuck up.

726
00:49:39,343 --> 00:49:41,811
See, you done fucked up, right?
You know that, right?

727
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:45,970
Just to let you know,
Rita's gonna kill you.

728
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,673
Rita.

729
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:49,613
- Oh, yeah, Rita.
- Fuck you.

730
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,788
You don't know what
you're talking about.

731
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,320
Oh, shit, what the...?

732
00:50:08,972 --> 00:50:10,667
Now what?

733
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:14,976
We watch, wait and look for anything
that doesn't look normal.

734
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:21,483
Hey, cuz, I think I see something.

735
00:50:24,721 --> 00:50:27,383
Motherfucking duct tape
good for everything, yo.

736
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:57,416
Anybody here strapped?

737
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:58,986
I need a piece.

738
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,002
You're up, nigga.

739
00:51:17,207 --> 00:51:19,300
Come on. Come on.

740
00:51:19,543 --> 00:51:21,602
Fuck that lumpy-head-ass nigga.

741
00:51:21,878 --> 00:51:25,370
Big egghead-looking, crackhead,
Michael Jackson-looking fucker.

742
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,050
- That's one ugly nigga right there.
- Oh, shit.

743
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,378
As soon as you inside,
you see the money...

744
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,384
...and they know
you won't jack them...

745
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,683
...that's when we come in like
Scud missiles, dropping them down.

746
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:38,122
And all you gotta do
is drop the drugs...

747
00:51:38,361 --> 00:51:40,886
...jump down
and crawl your black ass outside.

748
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:42,565
And what do I get?

749
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,562
- They jacking that nigga up.
- They roughing that nigga.

750
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,032
You don't get beat no more.

751
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:51,539
That hurt? Sorry.

752
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:54,209
At least give me a gun.
I gotta pack some heat.

753
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,139
Give me that thing.
Give me a ray gun.

754
00:51:56,346 --> 00:51:57,870
Keep it moving.

755
00:51:58,081 --> 00:52:00,140
This is for police.

756
00:52:00,417 --> 00:52:02,385
- Oh, shit.
- Deep-fry that nigga.

757
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:05,555
Yo, I wish we had a camera.
This when you need a camera.

758
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:07,788
You didn't hear him?

759
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:11,456
Gimpy, didn't you hear the man?
Keep on moving.

760
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,287
Look at the white boy pull up.

761
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,430
They not gonna fuck
with that white boy.

762
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,429
- I'll bet you $ 100.
- You out your mind.

763
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,228
- They about to beat his ass down.
- Put your money up.

764
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:23,739
Give me that.

765
00:52:24,541 --> 00:52:26,907
You turn your back
and you think it's all right?

766
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,634
You guys real police?

767
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,143
Are we real police?

768
00:52:31,348 --> 00:52:33,646
What's it say on the back
of his jacket?

769
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,015
"Are we real police?"
What's that supposed to mean?

770
00:52:38,221 --> 00:52:39,745
Is this a real stun gun?

771
00:52:41,057 --> 00:52:43,025
- I told you. I told you, nigga.
- Oh, shit.

772
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,286
They stunned that nigga.
Deep-fried that motherfucker's brain.

773
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:48,964
Told you. Give me
my motherfucking money.

774
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,492
There you go.

775
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:54,596
Grab your shit.

776
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:56,697
You look nice and dumb.

777
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:00,034
They'll give you whatever you need.
Go ahead, motherfucker.

778
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,801
Hurry up.

779
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:13,885
He looks like he's 12 years old.
Little bitch-ass nigga.

780
00:53:14,090 --> 00:53:15,955
Look like he going to the crib too.

781
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,786
Yeah, he is going in the crib.

782
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,809
What the fuck you want?

783
00:53:35,612 --> 00:53:37,705
Nantucket.

784
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,379
What, Daddy picked you up
from kindergarten?

785
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,514
He gave me some candy,
threw me in the back of a van...

786
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:48,384
...and told me to touch his wee-wee.

787
00:53:48,592 --> 00:53:51,823
God, a young nigga can't be
an entrepreneur? Shit.

788
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:05,872
This shit is taking all fucking day,
man.

789
00:54:06,376 --> 00:54:08,867
Doing what we need to be
doing, nigga. Don't sweat it.

790
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:14,109
So, now, what's in the bag?

791
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,022
Weigh this shit.

792
00:54:24,928 --> 00:54:25,917
You weigh it.

793
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,995
Hey. Dickhead, you weigh it.

794
00:54:30,233 --> 00:54:32,394
- You weigh it, eh.
- No, you weigh it, dickhead.

795
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,695
- No, you weigh it, eh.
- Shut up and weigh it.

796
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,735
You got crabs, eh.

797
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:41,876
I got runner-ups, okay?
Someone do the shit, I'm gonna play.

798
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:45,206
I got runner-up on your mom, eh.
Right there, eh.

799
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:48,782
- Oh, yeah? I got...
- Hey. Fucking shut the fuck up.

800
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:51,812
I said, weigh the shit.
I'm not fucking babysitting.

801
00:54:56,192 --> 00:54:58,092
Sorry.

802
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,459
I didn't tell you to fucking
close the bag.

803
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,602
Open the fucking bag, all right?

804
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,100
I gotta test the mess.

805
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:11,433
- That okay with you, Mr. Entrepreneur?
- Whatever.

806
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,274
Freeze, motherfucker! Police!

807
00:55:19,282 --> 00:55:23,412
Put them where I can see them.
Get on the motherfucking ground.

808
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,348
Drop it!

809
00:55:25,622 --> 00:55:28,284
- Stay down, bitch.
- Turn the fuck around.

810
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,751
Don't fucking move.

811
00:55:32,595 --> 00:55:34,961
Shut the fuck up.

812
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,162
Son of a bitch.

813
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,700
What are you doing here?

814
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:48,168
Armando, you look like shit, eh.

815
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,108
They fucked you good.

816
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:54,683
Sent you to kill your own family.

817
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,014
But you are family until you die.

818
00:55:58,254 --> 00:55:59,346
Now you see.

819
00:55:59,556 --> 00:56:01,114
Hey, man, English, motherfucker.

820
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:02,951
Hey, you ain't no real fucking cop.

821
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,161
- Fucking <i>puto</i> motherfucker.
- You know what?

822
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,330
I'm tired of fuckers
calling us fake cops.

823
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:09,964
- What's up, then, bitch?
- No, back the fuck up.

824
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,361
- I'll pop you in your face.
- Back the fuck up.

825
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:14,400
All right, then. All right.

826
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,161
I'm unarmed.

827
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,863
No gun<i>. Nada</i>, eh.

828
00:56:19,576 --> 00:56:21,066
So let's make a deal, all right?

829
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:23,541
Oh, now this motherfucker
wanna make a deal.

830
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:26,614
- I don't mind paying a little tax to...
- Put your head down.

831
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:31,911
But you know you're crazy
if you take this money.

832
00:56:32,756 --> 00:56:34,917
Well, you're going to have
to answer to Roland.

833
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:39,921
The state of California thanks y'all
for your patronage.

834
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,654
Come visit the Golden State anytime,
you heard me?

835
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,424
- Salim.
- Motherfuckers paid in this bitch.

836
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:46,692
Salim.

837
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,032
Where the fuck did Splooge go?

838
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,442
Oh, shit.

839
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:05,551
I'm shot.

840
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:08,553
What the fuck? Niggas is shooting
in there. We gotta go.

841
00:57:08,792 --> 00:57:10,054
Get up. Get up. Come on.

842
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,295
You with me?
Get up, they're coming.

843
00:57:19,569 --> 00:57:21,298
Come on.

844
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,776
Salim!

845
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:16,258
Keep your fucking head down.
Keep it down.

846
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:19,155
What's with the blood over here, man?
What's going on?

847
00:58:19,362 --> 00:58:20,920
What you got to say for yourself?

848
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,089
Where's the shit at?

849
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:28,160
The black dude took the dope,
and the Mexican dude took the money.

850
00:58:28,771 --> 00:58:31,103
Get the fuck up.
What the fuck you doing?

851
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,309
This ain't no fucking game. Get up.

852
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,525
The bullet went straight through,
man.

853
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,857
- That's good.
- I just gotta stop the bleeding.

854
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:57,862
Duct tape good for everything,
right?

855
00:58:58,101 --> 00:58:59,966
Oh, man, what the fuck did
I do to you?

856
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,670
What the fuck did I do to you?

857
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:04,271
The fucking money's gone,
the fucking dope's gone.

858
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,202
I'm fucking shot, man.

859
00:59:27,697 --> 00:59:30,564
Fucked up. I fucked it up big.

860
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:34,098
- It was all my fault.
- Don't worry about it, <i>carnal.</i>

861
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:37,938
You're home. I got your back, <i>ése.</i>

862
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,549
You know who the fuck that was
back there?

863
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:49,547
That was my family.
My first fucking family.

864
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,119
Finger-fuck those bitch, cuz.

865
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:57,351
We gotta get to a safe house.
I need a doctor. I'm in fucking pain.

866
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,269
- I need a fucking doctor here.
- Duct-tape that shit.

867
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:16,036
- I'll kick the back of your fucking head.
- Where is this piece of shit?

868
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:20,879
He ain't skateboarding down the
boardwalk with 13 kilos, motherfucker.

869
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:31,620
Motherfucker, you crazy?

870
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,464
What the fuck?

871
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:44,296
Where the fuck you going?

872
01:00:48,778 --> 01:00:50,746
Oh, this is some fucked-up shit.

873
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,645
Salim!

874
01:02:25,942 --> 01:02:26,966
Get out of here.

875
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,105
Now, motherfucker.

876
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,912
Stay right there. Stay right there.

877
01:02:36,119 --> 01:02:37,416
Little nigga.

878
01:02:45,394 --> 01:02:47,794
What the fuck you looking at?

879
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:22,647
You were supposed to feed them,
make them fat, and kill them.

880
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:24,322
Yeah, it wasn't my fault.

881
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:27,518
You're right.

882
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:29,524
It wasn't your fault.

883
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:33,168
Love for you still, my brother.

884
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:44,038
I want them all dead.
Go on!

885
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,484
- Stupid fucking niggas.
- All right.

886
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:58,850
Call your fucking boys
and make sure they clean it up.

887
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:01,530
I've sent troops over
to Salim's house.

888
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:04,892
I'm gonna make a personal visit
to Sancho's and see what I can do.

889
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,729
- All right?
- What did you say to Internal Affairs?

890
01:05:15,278 --> 01:05:19,442
Did you honestly think
that I was gonna take the fall?

891
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:23,345
I'm just looking out
for number one, captain.

892
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,021
And you are on a short leash.

893
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,556
So you better keep me close.

894
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,364
They're always watching.

895
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,255
Oh, fuck.

896
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:03,322
Fuck.

897
01:06:03,526 --> 01:06:05,687
You were right, man.
Baine set us up.

898
01:06:06,495 --> 01:06:08,554
What are we supposed to do, man?

899
01:06:09,932 --> 01:06:11,957
Oh, fuck.

900
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:16,130
What, you deaf and mute now, nigga?
Say something.

901
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,470
What the fuck we supposed to do,
cuz?

902
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,133
You don't know?

903
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,969
I just asked you what the fuck
we supposed to do.

904
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:31,313
You tell me, homey.

905
01:06:31,554 --> 01:06:33,920
Oh, you crazy now?

906
01:06:34,123 --> 01:06:36,353
What, am I talking to
my motherfucking self?

907
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:39,594
Why were you so anxious
to do this today?

908
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,490
Why were you so anxious?

909
01:06:42,698 --> 01:06:44,666
Why's my name
on that goddamn slip?

910
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,465
Nigga, have you lost
your motherfucking mind?

911
01:06:49,805 --> 01:06:52,865
Hell of a lot easier to come up
with me out of the way, isn't it?

912
01:07:01,384 --> 01:07:04,182
You don't know
what I'm talking about.

913
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:14,158
You're my partner, man.

914
01:07:16,365 --> 01:07:17,832
You're my best friend.

915
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,871
That's on everything.

916
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:29,203
That's for life.

917
01:07:29,845 --> 01:07:31,278
You heard me?

918
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,875
You heard me, cuz?

919
01:07:35,117 --> 01:07:36,846
That's for life.

920
01:07:49,632 --> 01:07:52,100
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.

921
01:07:52,334 --> 01:07:53,596
My nigga.

922
01:07:58,774 --> 01:08:00,605
Oh, shit.

923
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:04,542
What else am I supposed to do,
you know what I mean? Shit.

924
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:09,050
I ain't got nowhere else
to motherfucking go.

925
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:11,953
My homey.

926
01:08:16,225 --> 01:08:17,852
Fuck.

927
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:24,396
What's really going on, cuz?

928
01:08:27,903 --> 01:08:29,962
I had to do something today.

929
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:36,401
What did you do?

930
01:08:40,616 --> 01:08:42,277
That's the motherfucking doctor.

931
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,754
- You called it in?
- Yeah.

932
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:48,389
When you was chasing Splooge.

933
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:53,361
Shut the fuck up.

934
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:57,862
Don't say nothing.

935
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,174
Salim!

936
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:27,322
Easy, motherfucker.
Drop the piece, turn the fuck around.

937
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,622
Drop the fucking piece.

938
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,691
No, we're a long way
from fucking brothers.

939
01:09:32,935 --> 01:09:35,995
Turn the fuck around
and drop your fucking piece.

940
01:09:36,205 --> 01:09:38,264
- Drop it.
- We're on the same side, man.

941
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:40,465
What side is that?

942
01:09:40,676 --> 01:09:42,541
- You looking for me, motherfucker?
- Fuck.

943
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,213
Now you drop your shit, bitch.

944
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:48,314
Take this motherfucker's gun, cuz.

945
01:09:49,818 --> 01:09:51,445
That's right, bitch. You like that?

946
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,622
Get your ass in there, motherfucker.

947
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,916
You got that nigga, cuz.

948
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:02,122
Your partner's on the floor
bleeding like a stuck pig...

949
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,821
...and you think this is funny?

950
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:07,866
You better start talking, motherfucker.
Who sent y'all to fuck us up?

951
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:11,233
Man, they knew you were gonna rat.
What the fuck do you think?

952
01:10:11,473 --> 01:10:15,307
They thought I was gonna rat?
Who the fuck is "they"?

953
01:10:17,046 --> 01:10:19,139
Who the fuck is "they"?
Think this is a joke?

954
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,943
I ought to put this motherfucker
in your eye and blow your head off.

955
01:10:23,185 --> 01:10:26,814
- Say something, motherfucker.
- We can still get out of this, man.

956
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,088
Who set us up, motherfucker?

957
01:10:29,358 --> 01:10:31,519
Lieutenant, man,
who the fuck you think?

958
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,251
Lieutenant sent us here,
lieutenant sent you to Baine.

959
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,392
- Damn it.
- Well, what the fuck the drugs for?

960
01:10:38,434 --> 01:10:41,699
Payment for your murder.
Only Baine fucked up.

961
01:10:41,904 --> 01:10:45,032
He was supposed to take you out,
make it look like a gang hit.

962
01:10:45,241 --> 01:10:48,768
- You lying, I'll put one through your...
- I'm not fucking lying.

963
01:10:49,044 --> 01:10:51,478
- How'd he know we'd take the job?
- You heard him.

964
01:10:51,714 --> 01:10:53,841
How'd he know
we were gonna take the job?

965
01:10:54,049 --> 01:10:56,677
Because, you stupid fuck...

966
01:10:56,885 --> 01:11:01,219
...everybody knows you're a wannabe
who can't stand on his own feet.

967
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,519
Word?

968
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:12,125
Yeah, word.

969
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:16,295
- You swear to God?
- I swear to God.

970
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:18,796
You raise your hand and swear?

971
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,036
Your other hand, motherfucker.

972
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:27,105
Yeah, bitch. I swear to...

973
01:11:29,852 --> 01:11:33,117
- That's what's up.
- That's my fucking hand.

974
01:11:33,355 --> 01:11:36,916
You fuck. God.

975
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:42,029
Let him live.
We can still do some good.

976
01:11:49,938 --> 01:11:52,736
I will fucking kill you.

977
01:11:58,113 --> 01:11:59,774
Don't run.

978
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,195
We done good here.

979
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:42,521
Hey, hey. Hey.

980
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,783
Fuck that shit, cuz.

981
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:47,723
And you know I'm driving.

982
01:12:59,641 --> 01:13:02,337
Shit. It's on.

983
01:13:39,581 --> 01:13:43,210
You got your watch,
you got your rims.

984
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,718
- How does it feel?
- It feels good, motherfucker.

985
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:50,452
What the fuck do you want me to say,
I'm sorry?

986
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:55,961
All right, maybe you're right.
Maybe we go to IA, come clean.

987
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,529
- Fuck it.
- Now you wanna come clean.

988
01:13:58,734 --> 01:14:01,931
Who we gonna say killed
Rodriguez and Sayed, huh?

989
01:14:02,137 --> 01:14:03,695
- Gangbangers.
- Gangbangers?

990
01:14:03,906 --> 01:14:05,533
- Word up.
- They're gonna believe...

991
01:14:05,741 --> 01:14:09,108
...a beaner and a nigger that just stole
13 keys and killed two cops?

992
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:11,812
All they care about is the lieutenant.

993
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:15,447
About the robberies, the dealings
and the drugs and shit.

994
01:14:16,084 --> 01:14:18,985
We go together.
Tell them everything.

995
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:10,765
Let me ask you something, cuz.

996
01:15:12,207 --> 01:15:15,267
How the fuck could they think
we'd rat?

997
01:15:40,102 --> 01:15:44,630
As fucked up as I am, I could teach
you a thing or two about loyalty.

998
01:15:51,947 --> 01:15:54,006
Fucking city.

999
01:15:55,684 --> 01:15:58,517
I never could make sense of it.

1000
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,487
I know what I gotta do.

1001
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:04,848
I don't expect you to come with.

1002
01:16:08,196 --> 01:16:10,858
What you say go, remember?

1003
01:18:19,594 --> 01:18:21,494
It's been a long time, my brother.

1004
01:18:26,668 --> 01:18:28,966
I was loyal, <i>carnal.</i>

1005
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,738
Loyal to who, is the question.

1006
01:18:40,082 --> 01:18:42,550
None of that <i>pinche mierda</i>
would have happened...

1007
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:45,252
...if you'd told me you was
protecting H.A. now.

1008
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:57,325
I'm a businessman.

1009
01:18:57,532 --> 01:19:02,060
And when it comes to green,
I'm fucking color-blind.

1010
01:19:03,538 --> 01:19:07,372
And I don't need your
fucking permission or approval...

1011
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:11,842
...on how I conduct
my business, officer.

1012
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,348
Sorry.

1013
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:19,214
Where is my money?

1014
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,558
I don't know.

1015
01:19:28,396 --> 01:19:32,856
I swear on my Evita's life,
I don't fucking know.

1016
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,132
We'll see.

1017
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:40,734
Your shoeshine boy,
he knows where the money is?

1018
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:47,241
Have you ever seen what
someone looks like with no skin?

1019
01:19:52,354 --> 01:19:53,719
You see what a man is.

1020
01:19:53,955 --> 01:19:56,651
I mean, really is. Flesh and blood.

1021
01:19:57,259 --> 01:20:00,717
It's very interesting.
I enjoy it quite a lot.

1022
01:20:00,962 --> 01:20:02,896
And I never skinned a nigger before.

1023
01:20:40,101 --> 01:20:42,433
You have one choice.

1024
01:20:43,138 --> 01:20:47,006
You tell me where the money is,
or you have a bullet in your head.

1025
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:54,708
One pull of the trigger for yourself...

1026
01:20:54,916 --> 01:20:57,885
...or, as I assume you will
choose to do...

1027
01:20:58,119 --> 01:21:00,849
...two pulls of the trigger
for your partner.

1028
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:08,629
I am curious to know
where your true loyalty lies.

1029
01:21:08,830 --> 01:21:11,162
Cuz, tell this nigga what happened.

1030
01:21:11,399 --> 01:21:15,301
Tell him we got jacked and don't know
where the money is. Tell him, cuz.

1031
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,505
Who wants to go first?

1032
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,014
Fine, I choose.

1033
01:21:46,701 --> 01:21:48,362
It doesn't have to be this way.

1034
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:53,006
Just tell me where the money is.

1035
01:21:56,278 --> 01:21:59,770
One to yourself, or two to him.

1036
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:05,848
Shoot that bitch.
Shoot that white bitch.

1037
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:09,849
- Shoot him.
- Pull the fucking trigger, <i>ése.</i>

1038
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,958
Do it, <i>ése.</i>

1039
01:22:15,063 --> 01:22:16,052
Salim!

1040
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,357
You want a bullet in your head too?

1041
01:22:18,566 --> 01:22:21,694
You don't hear me, motherfucker?
I'm gonna shoot you in your face.

1042
01:22:22,070 --> 01:22:23,935
Salim!

1043
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,198
I'm just bullshitting.

1044
01:22:26,441 --> 01:22:27,931
Salim!

1045
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,041
- Oh, shit.
- Hey.

1046
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:41,083
Oh, shit. Hey, hey, hey.

1047
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:52,629
<i>Redemption is remembrance.</i>

1048
01:22:52,834 --> 01:22:55,394
<i>I killed an innocent man.</i>

1049
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:11,918
That's some gangster shit right there,
homey.

1050
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:15,586
It shows integrity, yeah. Bravery.

1051
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,350
<i>Pero</i> redemption does not come
so easy.

1052
01:23:27,836 --> 01:23:29,235
Do it, pig.

1053
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:34,969
Do it.

1054
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:38,111
- Grab it, <i>puto.</i>
- Grab it.

1055
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:59,166
Fuck. Fuck.

1056
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:28,490
All right.

1057
01:24:28,696 --> 01:24:31,392
I know... I know where the money is.

1058
01:24:33,101 --> 01:24:35,399
I know where the money is.

1059
01:24:36,771 --> 01:24:38,739
Stashed it in a motherfucking alley.

1060
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:56,383
That the kind of family
you were looking for?

1061
01:24:58,393 --> 01:25:01,556
That the kind of family
who would die for you?

1062
01:25:06,267 --> 01:25:08,895
Hey, let us go, man, now.

1063
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,638
I'll take you to the dough.

1064
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:26,345
One pull of the trigger for yourself,
or two for him.

1065
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,078
That's not the deal, cuz.

1066
01:25:28,289 --> 01:25:32,749
- You got one more shot, <i>puto.</i>
- Shut the fuck up. The game is over.

1067
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,953
You kill me, you don't get the dough.
That's what's up.

1068
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,803
Look at him.

1069
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:55,949
Look at him!

1070
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:04,621
Hey, motherfucker...

1071
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:08,694
...I want you to look at him.

1072
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:13,962
Look at him.

1073
01:26:14,202 --> 01:26:16,830
You take a good fucking look at him.

1074
01:26:27,649 --> 01:26:29,947
It's never over.

1075
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,325
<i>There's only one kind of wisdom...</i>

1076
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:43,622
<i>... and that's hindsight.</i>

1077
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,731
<i>Everything happens in bits...</i>

1078
01:26:45,967 --> 01:26:49,368
<i>... and you don't wake up</i>
<i>until afterwards.</i>

1079
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:52,370
<i>Until it's too late.</i>

1080
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,340
What's it smell like?

1081
01:27:17,265 --> 01:27:19,392
Take him to get the money.

1082
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:20,894
<i>In that final moment...</i>

1083
01:27:21,102 --> 01:27:24,594
<i>... you wait for something,</i>
<i>anything, to take you away.</i>

1084
01:27:24,806 --> 01:27:28,333
<i>And what returns,</i>
<i>what finally comes home to you...</i>

1085
01:27:28,543 --> 01:27:31,603
<i>... is your own fucking self.</i>

1086
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:34,373
<i>Nothing can save you from that.</i>

1087
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:37,983
Police officer. I need help.

1088
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,880
Help.

1089
01:27:40,121 --> 01:27:42,248
I need help!

1090
01:27:57,171 --> 01:28:00,231
<i>You can't change</i>
<i>the color of your skin.</i>

1091
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,875
<i>You can't change</i>
<i>the color of your heart.</i>

1092
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:06,376
<i>You can change</i>
<i>the colors you wear...</i>

1093
01:28:06,581 --> 01:28:09,914
<i>... but deep down inside,</i>
<i>you'll always be...</i>

1094
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:15,021
<i>... the same salvationless</i>
<i>motherfucker you always were.</i>

1095
01:28:17,592 --> 01:28:20,925
No idea. No.

1096
01:28:22,297 --> 01:28:23,889
Hey, where the fuck you been?

1097
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:27,427
Jesus.

1098
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:32,300
Got the chem-lab report.

1099
01:28:36,878 --> 01:28:40,678
Fake shit. Cut with
some heavy-duty rat poison.

1100
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:43,746
Fucking payback.

1101
01:29:05,506 --> 01:29:07,474
Bye, bitch.

1102
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:30,193
It's never easy grieving
over the death of a partner.

1103
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:32,695
Even if he went crazy
and tried to kill you.

1104
01:29:34,202 --> 01:29:38,400
The pressure of knowing he did wrong
that day must have gotten to him.

1105
01:29:39,407 --> 01:29:41,602
You had no choice,
it was self-defense.

1106
01:29:42,443 --> 01:29:46,243
After he killed Rodriguez and Sayed
single-handedly.

1107
01:29:47,014 --> 01:29:50,040
We're even more sorry
about your girlfriend.

1108
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:52,476
I'm sorry he made it personal.

1109
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:56,117
Our deepest sympathies.

1110
01:30:07,568 --> 01:30:10,696
But my son Elijah's okay, right?

1111
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:24,013
So according to your report,
after roll call...

1112
01:30:24,685 --> 01:30:27,051
...you went on your rounds.

1113
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:37,189
Sancho turned on you, went ballistic.
You went in pursuit.

1114
01:30:40,902 --> 01:30:44,565
You told Officer Sancho
that you were gonna come clean...

1115
01:30:44,772 --> 01:30:48,469
...and let IA know that he was
responsible for the shooting.

1116
01:30:48,709 --> 01:30:49,903
You understand that?

1117
01:30:51,512 --> 01:30:53,377
Good.

1118
01:30:53,581 --> 01:30:56,414
You showed yourself to be
a real hero today.

1119
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,744
You should be proud.

1120
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,424
Oh, I called Internal Affairs.

1121
01:31:06,661 --> 01:31:09,095
Let them know you'd be a little late.

1122
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:14,825
I'm sorry it got so messy, Salim.

1123
01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:19,000
Listen, you're gonna be at IA
for a little while.

1124
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,708
You still have
those courtside seats?

1125
01:31:24,879 --> 01:31:29,441
<i>Nobody talks about the day</i>
<i>of their death like, "Today is the day."</i>

1126
01:31:32,186 --> 01:31:34,814
<i>But today was the day.</i>

1127
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:44,857
You see things a lot more clearly
when you're dead.
