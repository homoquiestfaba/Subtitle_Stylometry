Good tidings on Christmas
and a Happy New Year

Now bring us
some figgy pudding

Now bring us
some figgy pudding

8
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,337
Now bring us
some figgy pudding...

Holy night

All is calm

How did the cookies go over?

21
00:02:11,364 --> 00:02:13,298
Like garlic bread
at a vampire picnic.

22
00:02:13,366 --> 00:02:17,302
Oh, people here are much
more health conscious
than back in the old country.

23
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:20,669
Anthrax scotchies are very
high in saturated fat.

24
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,732
Well, more for us
then, hmm? What
smells so good?

25
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,801

Now, shoo.

29
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,645
Go help Grandpa and Marilyn
decorate the living room.

30
00:02:32,719 --> 00:02:34,619
Oh, is the tree up?
Goody.

31
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:38,817
Oh, and please remind Grandpa
to check the stockings before
he hangs them.

32
00:02:38,892 --> 00:02:41,087
Last year he forgot
to take the feet out.

33
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,825
(SINGING) it's Christmas
and the graveyard folk
have all come out to play

34
00:02:45,899 --> 00:02:47,332
They're going to take...

35
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,764
Well, would you just
look at all this?

36
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:54,898
I don't think I've ever seen
halls decked quite as nicely.

37
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:59,843
If I didn't know any better,
I would think that this is
Santa's jolly-holly mausoleum.

38
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:04,450
I think Grandpa's got
a little interior decorator
in his blood.

39
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,712
That's where I got
the makings for
these mistletoes.

40
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:11,181
Mistle-toes?

41
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:12,451
Get it?

42
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:18,892
Uncle Herman, can you help
me charge up the lights?

43
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,728
Oh, happy to oblige.

It's beautiful.

46
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,309
Well, it's about the
prettiest tree I've ever seen.

47
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,940
Eddie's going to be so
excited when he sees this.

48
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:40,648
Kids, that's what
Christmas is all about.

I can't wait to see the happy
expression on his little face
when he sees this.

Eddie. Eddie,
what do you think, huh?

52
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:53,261
Isn't this the most Christmassy
sight you've ever seen?

53
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,695
Well, maybe we should all
fan out a little bit
and let Eddie take it all in.

54
00:03:59,772 --> 00:04:01,364
He's speechless.

55
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:04,106
We saved something for you,
Eddie.

56
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,344
You get to top off
the tree, Son.

What do you think, Son?

60
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,456
A little buzzard whispered
into my ear that this could
be the merriest Christmas yet.

61
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,961
Yeah. I guess.

62

with you?

following us?

I'm too scared
to look.

so I could change into
a werewolf.

Uh-huh. And then we could
both fly away in my
private Learjet.

Egghead and some
Munster cheese.

feel like home.

Christmas has always
been Eddie's favorite.

Don't worry,
Lily. I'll think
of something.

Okay, Munsters, we are in
the holiday crisis mode.
Eddie needs our help.

124
00:08:26,706 --> 00:08:29,732
And I'll be poked
with a pitchfork before
I let him down.

125
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:34,278
Don't knock a little pitchfork
poking until you've tried it.

126

We have to make Eddie
feel like this is home.

127
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:42,348
Show him that Christmas here
can be just as wonderful as
it was in the old country.

00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:45,515
So, we need to give Eddie
the perfect Transylvanian
Christmas?

129
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:48,692
Right. Now, what does
that mean, you might ask?

I'm talking
the ultimate present.

from Transylvania.

complete with
stretch-o-matic action.

00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:23,152
What little boy
wouldn't love
to have that?

141
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,959
Herman, we can't
afford this.

142
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,624
Nonsense, Lily,
it's Christmas.

143
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,464
I'll just have a little talk
with Mr. Gateman down
at the parlor.

144
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,766
I'm sure he'll be
happy to give me
an advance.

145
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,069
That's it?
That's your big plan?

146
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:37,837
A toy dungeon?

147
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,607
I think someone's
neck bolts are too tight.

148
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,150
If someone has
another idea,
I'd like to hear it.

149
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,582
Actually,

150
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,982
Eddie's homesick
for Transylvania.

151
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,549
I say we invite the family
from the old country and
throw a big Christmas party.

152
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,618
Now we're cooking.
Lily? Any ideas?

153
00:09:56,696 --> 00:10:01,258
The reason LA doesn't
feel like home to Eddie
is because he's alienated.

154
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:03,393
He needs to get involved.

155
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:09,601
The Homeowner's Association
is having a big holiday
decorating contest.

156
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,768
I'm going to enter us
and get Eddie to help me.

157
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:14,540
That way he can feel
that he's really involved
in something.

158
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,206
Give me that chalk.

159
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:19,217
You people are making
this so complex,

160
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,253
so psychological.

161
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,812
All Eddie needs is snow.

162
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:30,522
All Eddie needs is an
old-fashioned Transylvanian
white Christmas.

163
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,755
In Southern California?

164
00:10:32,832 --> 00:10:37,292
You are looking
at Eastern Europe's
preeminent alchemist.

165
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,736
I could make it snow
in your pants if I want.

166
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:42,337
Well, I'd rather you didn't,
if it's all the same to you.

167
00:10:42,408 --> 00:10:47,903
All it takes, is a little
of this, a little of that,
a bit of MSG,

168
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,472
and, poof,
instant blizzard.

169
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:55,719
So, what we have now
is a four-step plan.

170
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,288
Everybody's gonna pitch in.

171
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,586
I'll get the money

I want a vacation.

346
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,593
Somewhere where it's
warm and sunny,

347
00:24:24,663 --> 00:24:27,223
there's hot sand
and plenty of cold beer.

348
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,391
(LAUGHING)

349
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,435
And rubbing tanning
lotion on supermodels?

350
00:24:30,502 --> 00:24:32,561
Surgically enhanced
supermodels.

351
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,797
(LAUGHING)

352
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,102
BOTH: Silicone.
Silicone. Silicone.

353
00:24:36,174 --> 00:24:38,972
Oh, hush boys.
You're spooking Blitzen.

354
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:41,669
Give me a blizzard.

355
00:24:41,746 --> 00:24:44,647
Give me the big one
from the Pole.

356
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,350
Where the fa-la-la-la-la am I?

357
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,117
What am I doing here?

358
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:54,158
Who are you people?

359
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:58,128
Somebody around here has been
naughty and I want answers.

360
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,791
Uh..."Naughty" is
a very strong word.

361
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:04,260
Oh, look! Elves!

362
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,937
You guys are so cute.

363
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,571
She thinks we're cute.

364
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,335
I heard.
Pinch me.

365
00:25:11,109 --> 00:25:13,043
Ow! Not so hard,
you moron.

366
00:25:13,111 --> 00:25:15,671
Lefty, Larry,
behave yourselves, you boys.

367
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,840
We're gonna find out
where we are.

368
00:25:17,916 --> 00:25:20,043
You're in
Mockingbird Heights,
California.

369
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:22,916
I'm Marilyn Munster
and this is my grandpa.

370
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:25,218
He accidentally
transported you here.

371
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,621
California?

372
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,457
Two days before Christmas,
and I'm in bah-humbuggin'
California?

373
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:33,262
Oh, pardon my Norse, miss.

374
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,663
It's just that
it's a bad time for me,

375
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,328
what with Christmas Eve
tomorrow night and all.

376
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,366
Hey, Larry,
I just found religion

377
00:25:41,439 --> 00:25:42,838
(LAUGHING)

378
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:44,967
She defies the
laws of physics.

379
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,443
It'd take me an hour
to climb up that.

380
00:25:47,512 --> 00:25:49,605
BOTH: But it'd be
worth the trip.

381
00:25:49,681 --> 00:25:51,706
Look, Grandpa, isn't it?

382
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,215
I need to get back to the
North Pole right away.

383
00:25:55,287 --> 00:26:00,281
Or there's going to be
a lot of very disappointed
children this Christmas.

384
00:26:00,358 --> 00:26:01,689
LARRY: Oh, my, my, my.

385
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,455
You can send me back there,
can't you?

386
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:04,722
Stop that!
Can't you?

387
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,554
Are you kidding me?

388
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:10,898
I am Eastern Europe's
preeminent alchemist.

389
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:13,904
All it takes is
a little magic.

390
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:16,167
Why don't we give the
magic a rest, Grandpa,

391
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:19,142
before you turn him into
a lunch-box or something?

392
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,973
Let's try this
the safe way.

393
00:26:23,648 --> 00:26:25,172
I'll just call
the airlines.

394
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:29,243
This is great.
For once, we're getting
what we want for Christmas.

395
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,447
The night off.

396
00:26:30,522 --> 00:26:31,580
Oh.

397
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,021
Well, what about
all the little
boys and girls?

398
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,082
It'll teach them
to deal with
disappointment.

399
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,355
We're in
Southern California,
dude.

400
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:42,560
They've got it all here.
Surfing, ball games,
mud wrestling.

401
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:43,658
Naked beaches?

402
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:45,293
All-girl
volleyball teams.

403
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,997
Yes. I'd like to book
a flight to the
North Pole please.

404
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:49,165
(GROANING)

405
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,639
Hey, face it.

406
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:54,475
As long as Sir Tub-a-lot
is stuck here, the party
light is lit.

407
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,706
Yes.

408
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:59,016
Tell them he's
the original frequent flier.

409
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,980
The passenger's name
is Kringle, first name
Kris. Hello?

(DIAL TONE)

411
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,110
Hello?

412
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:06,220
Hello?

413
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,122
They hung up.

414
00:27:08,193 --> 00:27:09,922
Well, maybe
it's for the best.

415
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,020
I hate traveling
by plane.

416
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,990
I don't understand how
they keep the darn things
in the air.

417
00:27:15,066 --> 00:27:20,197
Well, are we ready
to stoop to use
my magic?

418
00:27:20,271 --> 00:27:22,239
After all, I am...

419
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,504
ALL: Eastern Europe's
preeminent alchemist.

420
00:27:25,577 --> 00:27:26,976
We know already.

421
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:29,777
We should ask
Uncle Herman
and Aunt Lily first.

422
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:30,940
Oh, yes.
They'll know
what to do.

423
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:32,005
Oh, good.

424
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:35,780
No, no, no. We can't do that.
You know how they get.

425
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,119
They become upset,
they blow things
out of proportion.

426
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:40,748
They'll take away
my chemicals.

427
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:45,326
Got it all under control.
Relax. Trust me.

428
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,025
(SCOFFING)

429
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,065
All right, Eddie,
throw the switch.

(REACTOR WHIRRING)

431
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:01,401
That nuclear reactor
that Grandpa installed
sure is a life saver.

432
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,039
Especially
with our summer
air-conditioning bills.

(GASPING)

434
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,255
I've never seen
a house this festive.

435
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,266
Now aren't you proud
of what we did together?

436
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:24,824
Yeah. I guess.

437
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:25,995
Oh.

438
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,736
I know you're sad,
Eddie.

439
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,173
But you can let yourself
be a little proud
of what we've done.

440
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:33,142
After all,
people are impressed
with you.

441
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:37,545
Excuse me,
are you Lily Munster?

442
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,314
Why, yes.
And you are?

Bob Pawlikowski.

444
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,122
I'm the chair
of the voting committee.

445
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:48,853
Oh. A pleasure
to meet you.

446
00:28:51,596 --> 00:28:54,064
Well, this is it.

447
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:58,364
We're thinking
about calling it
"Santa, bloody Santa."

448
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:00,768
How cheery.

449
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,399
Uh-oh.

450
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:06,242
And this is
my son, Eddie.
He's the artist.

451
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:07,804
That's your son?

452
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:11,280

I thought he was
one of the decorations.

Oh, great flaming bunions.
What is that?

455
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:24,393
That's Eddie's creation,
Randolph the Rabid Reindeer.
Show him, Eddie.

456
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,089
Come on, Mom.

457
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,358

Us Munsters don't
skimp when it comes
to Christmas.

462
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,986
It's absolutely horrifying.

463
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,515
You're too kind.

464
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,657
The final vote isn't
until Christmas morning.

465
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,585
But as far as your
display is concerned,

466
00:29:56,661 --> 00:29:58,629
I'm afraid things
look pretty bleak.

467
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,223
Oh, wonderful.

468
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:04,266
That's exactly the effect
we were aiming for.

469
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,326
Oh, he said something to her.

470
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:08,736
He said something to her
and she looks happy.

00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,968
I say we do
some bar hopping.

00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,777
How about mud wrestling?
Can we see mud wrestling?

477

starting to get nervous.

is ticking and
we're still here.

as Mom's happy.

nothing seems
to excite him.

I thought he'd at least start
to snap out of it by now,
but so far, zero.

00:33:57,935 --> 00:33:59,527
He died with his boots off.

518
00:34:03,074 --> 00:34:05,008
What happened?
What was that noise?

519
00:34:05,076 --> 00:34:06,407
It's Grandpa.

520
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,741
He... He...

521
00:34:08,813 --> 00:34:11,338
Wow, that was hot.

522
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,852
I nearly singed the hair
right off the top of my feet.

523
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:18,853
Grandpa?
I demand
an explanation.

524
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,390
It's entirely my fault.

525
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:22,249
We made an unscheduled
stopover,

526
00:34:22,326 --> 00:34:26,057
and Grandpa was just trying
to help me and the boys
go home.

527
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,825
Where are those elves?

528
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:34,600
Santa? Santa Claus?
Is it really you.

00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:39,339
You're hurting him.

532
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,139
My spine!

534
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,110
Oh, it's okay.
Sorry.

535
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,945
Herman, right?

536
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:49,111
He knows my name.
Santa Claus knows my name.

537
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:53,817
Look who it is, Son.
It's Santa himself.

538
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,985
Now doesn't that
set your Christmas
spirit soaring?

539
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:58,892
Go over there
and don't be nervous.
Say hello to him.

540
00:34:58,963 --> 00:35:01,158
(STAMMERING) You can sit
on his lap later.

541
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:02,590

542
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,027

00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:12,634
I'm Santa Claus, son.
It's my job.

It really does shake
like a bowl of jelly.

549
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:29,951
No more hugs.

550
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:31,358
Oh, sorry.

551
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:50,010
364 days out of every year,
all I do is prepare
for this one night.

552
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,047
I just can't miss it.

553
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:54,885
Don't worry.
Grandpa's on the case.

554
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:58,086
Yeah. Sooner or later,
he's bound to luck out
and get the spell right.

555
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:01,689
Well, I hope so,
for all the children's sake.

556
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,862
Nothing like a little
black widow's tea
to calm the nerves.

557
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,091
Oh, thank you,
Mrs. Munster.

558
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,224
Um-hmm.

(THUMPING)

560
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,980
Well, Eddie, is there
anything you'd like
to ask Santa Claus,

561
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:34,615
as long as we've got
the man right here?

562
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:36,125
No, that's okay.
Thanks.

563
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,354
Oh. Okay.

564
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:40,056
Well, Santa, do you mind
if I ask you something?

565
00:36:40,665 --> 00:36:42,030
Go right ahead, Herman.

566
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:47,898
Let me do this the formal way.

567
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:51,339
(GROANING)

568
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,809
Santa? Santa,
how do you do it, hmm?

569
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,743
I mean, how do you
deliver all those gifts

570
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,441
to all those children all over
the world in one night, hmm?

571
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:02,543
And how do you fit those
zillion toys Into the one,
big burlap bag?

572
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,144
(GROANING)

573
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,883
I'm gonna black out now.

00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:09,552
Herman, I think I hear
bones crunching.

575
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:11,291
Oh!

576
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:13,062
Oh, sorry, sorry.

577
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:17,692
Sometimes I wonder what
pauper's grave they dug
my brains out of.

578
00:37:17,768 --> 00:37:19,895
Oh, no,
it's all right,
Herman.

579
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,997
My lap's built up
quite a few calluses
over the years.

(GRUNTING)

581
00:37:25,142 --> 00:37:27,007
Oh, and that
lumbar pinch.

582
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,213
SANTA: Oh, what's that?
That...

583
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,179
It's addressed to me.

584
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:36,677
What is that, Eddie?

585
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,517
It's nothing.

586
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,947
Is that your letter
to Santa?

587
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,823
It must have gotten
lost in the mail.
No worry, though.

588
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,498
I can put in an
express order for you.

589
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,034
No thanks.
That's okay.

590
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:54,037
See, I didn't mail it
for a reason this year.

591
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:56,440
I don't want anything
from anybody.

592
00:37:57,675 --> 00:37:59,734
I just want
Christmas to be over.

593
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:06,415
Well, I just...
I don't know
what to do.

594
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:08,452
I've never seen
Eddie like this.

595
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:11,386
And, Santa,
maybe you could...

596
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:14,852
Oh? Might I talk
to him?

597
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,757
Oh, Santa.

598
00:38:17,662 --> 00:38:19,653
That would be
wonderful.

Fine scorpion farm
you've got there.

601
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:36,410
They're tricky to raise.

602
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:42,877
Careful. You hold them too
close to the stinger,
you might snap the tail.

603
00:38:43,754 --> 00:38:44,948
You know about scorpions?

604
00:38:45,022 --> 00:38:48,116
Oh, I know about
a lot of things.
I was your age once.

605
00:38:49,226 --> 00:38:53,686
Granted, it was hundreds
of years ago, but nothing
ever changes that much.

606
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:54,988
Yeah?

607
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,593
Bet your parents never
made you move to a whole
another country.

Oh, they sure did.

609
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:04,369
One time my dad moved us all
to Greenland so he could look
for work as a toymaker.

610
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,034
I hated Greenland.

611
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:11,480
It was bitterly cold and the
only kids around to play with
were Viking children.

612

Nothing meaner
than a young Viking.

613
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,642
Then you haven't met
Hector Barberi.

Oh, I know Hector.

Passed the time
by learning to build toys.

620
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:34,203
Pretty soon, I had some
friends, and Greenland
actually felt like home.

621
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:40,098
Well, that's easy for you,
I mean, you're Santa Claus.

622
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,213
And you're Eddie Munster.

special, if you ask me.

of a rough place.

691
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,372
Bikers, bar brawls,
that kind of thing.
But, you know.

692
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,414
Oh, well,
it sounds nice.

693
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:41,047
Tell you what,
we've got kind of a lot
going on around here tonight.

694
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,642
But if I can, I'll be there.

695
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,315
Sounds good.

696
00:43:47,524 --> 00:43:48,991
That green guy
is your uncle?

697
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:52,495
Yeah. Mom's side
of the family got
all the looks.

698
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:54,052
Oh.

699
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,326
Well, maybe I'll
see you later.

700
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,799
I hope so.

701
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:00,863
Bye.

702
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:02,098
Bye.

703
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,815
Bye.
Bye.

704
00:44:15,285 --> 00:44:17,446
Oh, to be young
and in love again.

705
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:22,625
Oh, my gosh.

706
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:24,388
I've got to find
something to wear.

707
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:27,794
How could you
forget your ID?

708
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,356
I'm 608 years old and
I've got a full beard.

709
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:32,163
I wasn't expecting
to get carded.

710
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,761
You're three feet
six inches tall,
your toes jingle.

711
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:36,032
Someone was bound
to ask.

712
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:38,301
Lefty. Larry.
Good news, boys.

713
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:42,835
Grandpa has figured out
the missing ingredient
to his teleportation potion.

714
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:46,178
Marshmallow fudge
SnackWell's cookies.

715
00:44:46,483 --> 00:44:47,609
Yes.

716
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:51,086
Those suckers never
cease to amaze me.

717
00:44:52,356 --> 00:44:54,586
We're going back?
There's no way
we're going back.

718
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:55,955
No way we're
going back. No.

719
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,618
Absolutely no.
We can't go back.

720
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,629
We've got to stay here.
We're gonna party. Come on.

721
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:01,562
No, wait. We can't go back.
Wait. No, no, no, no. Wait.

722
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:03,031
We can't go back. Wait. Wait.

723
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,330
Come on. Come on.
Let's go. Come on.

724
00:45:12,976 --> 00:45:13,965
Elves.

725
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,676
Grandpa,
how long will it take?

726
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,274
Oh, about an hour.

727
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,750
In the meantime,
Grandpa's bushed.

728
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,121
(WINGS FLAPPING)

729
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,317
Got to get my beauty sleep.

730
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:32,020
An hour?

731
00:45:32,696 --> 00:45:36,097
I've got to get back and
finish making those toys
for the children.

732
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:37,792
Boys?

733
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,891
Boys?

734
00:45:41,772 --> 00:45:43,637
Now where've those
elves got to?

735
00:45:44,007 --> 00:45:47,875
Oh well, they're elves,
you know. They're probably
off doing something jolly.

736
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:49,803
What'd you hit me for?

737
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,177
Because, I'm mad,
and you're close.

738
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:54,376
I'm telling you.
I've had it.
I'm not going back.

739
00:45:56,553 --> 00:45:57,884
What're we
gonna do?

740
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,946
Something we
should have done
a long time ago.

741
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,752
Cancel Christmas.

742
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,820
We're gonna put
the Load Warrior
out of commission.

743
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,255
How are we gonna
do that?

744
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:12,063
I don't know.
Let me think.

745
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:14,662
Let me think.

746
00:46:17,074 --> 00:46:19,565
(CHUCKLING)
Larry, this is it.

747
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:25,113
Santa's about
to have himself
a sleepy little Christmas.

748
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,849
Now where did I
put my keys?

749
00:46:31,922 --> 00:46:35,653
You know, sometimes I swear
I'd lose my head if it wasn't
bolted on.

750
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:39,019
You know, I'm so excited.
I'll be home in one hour.

751
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:42,654
Well, in the meantime,
I've got to go out and
get some supplies

752
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:45,861
for my new job.
Telephone solicitation.

753
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,203
I'm trying to work
my own Christmas
magic here.

754
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:52,169
You know, Herman,
I could help you
with whatever you need.

755
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:57,771
No, thank you, Santa.
No, I'd rather do it
myself and for Eddie.

756
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,283
Well, I'm sure you'll
do just great.

757
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:03,114
I think so.
I'm a people-pleaser.

758
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:05,545
Oh. There it is.

759
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:07,546
Pardon me.

760
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,023
(EXCLAIMING)

761
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:17,793
Okay, Mr. Stitches just
left out the front door.

762
00:47:17,868 --> 00:47:20,564
Hurry up and add the sleep
potion so we can get out
of here.

763
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,161
Sleep potion. Right.

764
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,371
All set at this end.

765
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:29,605
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

766
00:47:33,083 --> 00:47:35,916
(SINGING) Someone's
in the kitchen with Lefty

767
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,614
Someone's in the
kitchen I know

768
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:41,520
We'll give Santa
sleeping potion

769
00:47:41,592 --> 00:47:44,959
And Christmas Eve
will be no go

770
00:47:46,463 --> 00:47:47,657
Hang on,
I'll be right back.

771
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:48,925
Okay.

772
00:47:52,836 --> 00:47:53,860
(CLEARING THROAT)

773
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:55,165
(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Oh, Santa?

774
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,433
Snack time.

775
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,046
Did somebody say "snack"?

776
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:10,710
I could have sworn
that I heard...

777
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,792
Figgy pudding.

778
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:22,693
What a wonderful family.

779
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:28,866
Bizarre, frightening,
but wonderful.

780
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:35,867
(BURPING)

781
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,823
(GASPING)

782
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,349
I think something
went wrong.

783
00:49:20,924 --> 00:49:23,449
"Dessert transmogrification
elixir?"

784
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,262
Congratulations,
Chestnut-head.

785
00:49:26,330 --> 00:49:28,457
You just turned
Santa into fruitcake.

786
00:49:29,166 --> 00:49:30,155
I did?

787
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:36,830
Okay, look at
the bright side.

788
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:40,035
We did want Santa
out of commission.
Let's face it.

789
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,635
You can't get much more
out of commission than

790
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:45,807
being magically transformed
into a holiday dessert.

791
00:49:45,882 --> 00:49:48,749
This clears the way
for us to have
a little fun

792
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,548
(LAUGHING)

793
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,258
I say we check out
this place tonight.

794
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:57,759
Hog Heaven.

795
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:02,189
Hot music, cold beer,
dancing.

796
00:50:02,265 --> 00:50:04,233
Whoa, but before
we go anywhere,

797
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:08,567
I say we check out
Grandpa's lab and do
a little redecorating.

798
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,206
Great idea. Oh, that lab
is so dingy and cramped.

799
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:16,603
We can really open it up
a bit, add some light.

800
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,147
Experiment with colors.

801
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:21,311
We can create a flow
from the stairs.

802
00:50:21,385 --> 00:50:22,545
Please.

803
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,849
I don't mean
really redecorate it.

804
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:28,220
I mean, trash the place
so nobody can fix Santa.

805
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:31,887
One thought.

806
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:36,866
What if, while
we're gone, someone
tries to eat Santa?

807
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:42,032
Never happen.
Nobody likes fruitcake.

808
00:50:56,486 --> 00:50:59,512
Oh, hello. Hello.
Mrs. Tesseract?

809
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:03,320
Yes, my name is Herman
and I'm with Consolidated
Air Conditioning.

810
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,725
Do you find your home
stuffy and uncomfortable?

811
00:51:05,796 --> 00:51:09,163
Do you find yourself
soaked with sweat
on hot summer days?

812
00:51:09,499 --> 00:51:11,592
Hmm? Oh, yes, certainly.

813
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:17,038
Do you find yourself soaked
with sweat on hot summer days?

814
00:51:17,808 --> 00:51:22,268
Uh, yes, yes, yes.
I'm a big believer
in discipline.

815
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:25,109
My, aren't you
the curious one?

816
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:28,040
A night gown and big boots.

817
00:51:28,118 --> 00:51:29,278
How about you?

818
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:34,982
Well, I guess you won't be
needing an air conditioner
then.

819
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,025
I'm sorry to trouble you.

820
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:42,454
Santa?

821
00:51:56,213 --> 00:51:59,011
You have to see
this Munster display.

822
00:51:59,082 --> 00:52:00,982
It's something
really special.

823
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:03,818
You really like
that monstrosity?

824
00:52:03,887 --> 00:52:07,118
Well, Fran. It seems
you missed the obvious
tip of the hat

825
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,954
to the Artaudian
theater of cruelty.

826
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,688
FRAN: I did?
It jumps right out at me.

827
00:52:12,762 --> 00:52:15,230
But with my extensive
background in art.

828
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,357
Maybe if we squint.

829
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:21,232
Oh, no. The judges
are lingering.

830
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:23,672
That's a bad sign.

831
00:52:24,174 --> 00:52:25,641
(WHISTLING)

832
00:52:30,447 --> 00:52:32,312
Is that whistling I hear?

833
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:36,717
Well, it's hard to be totally
grouchy when you got
Santa Claus in your house.

834
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,648
He's pretty cool
for an old guy.

835
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,756
Old? He's only 970.

836
00:52:42,292 --> 00:52:44,283
And he doesn't look
a day over 400.

837
00:52:44,361 --> 00:52:48,320
Yoo-hoo. Bob. Bob. Yoo-hoo.

838
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:49,763
How nice.

839
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,131
Edna's coming over
to admire our decorations.

840
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:54,398
Oh, dear.

841
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:59,364
So, what do you say
we leave this ugly,
inappropriate lawn

842
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,740
and walk across the
street to my house

843
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:03,972
for some delicious
decorations?

844
00:53:04,047 --> 00:53:06,811
Oh, I mean, dessert.

845
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:10,118
I suppose a tiny little
bite wouldn't hurt.

846
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:16,992
Oh. Herman, Edna Dimwitty
is outside and I don't have
a Christmas present for her.

847
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:19,086
(GASPING)

848
00:53:19,162 --> 00:53:20,925
A fruitcake.

849
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,396
Perfect.

850
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:23,955
Oh, Herman.

851
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:26,497
You're the best.

852
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,002
Dessert?
My favorite word.

853
00:53:33,076 --> 00:53:34,168
But the judging.

854
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:35,472
Oh, it can wait.

855
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,070
Last one back to Edna's
is defective light bulb.

856
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:39,505
Edna.

857
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:41,107
Oh? Oh, what does
she want?

858
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,577
Well, go on.
Go on.

859
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,383
I'll catch up.

860
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:49,881
Edna.

861
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,625

missing something.

and with a twinkle
in his eye.

867
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:15,976
Santa?

868
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:17,713
Oh, my.
Are you sure
he's missing?

869
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,550
We haven't
seen him
for hours.

870
00:54:20,657 --> 00:54:23,854
He could be lost
somewhere, or hurt.
We've got to find him.

Have you seen Santa?

You really didn't
have to go to all
this trouble, Edna.

No trouble.

So, how's that judging coming?
Made any decisions yet?

879
00:55:20,917 --> 00:55:22,817
Standards are very
high this year.

But don't worry,
you're one of

That display of theirs
is very sophisticated art.

884
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:37,125
Did you know that I imported
decorations from France
this year at great expense?

885
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,067
I hear the Munsters got theirs
at a Halloween clearance sale.

But we can talk
about that over dessert.

the holiday right.

1033
01:06:12,068 --> 01:06:15,401
Darn, darn, darn.
This is hopeless.

1034
01:06:15,471 --> 01:06:17,871
Well, let's not
give up,
Herman Munster.

1035
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:21,307
Go down to Grandpa's lab
and see if any of his
blowfish bile survived.

1036
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:22,776
Maybe that's
what I'm missing.

1037
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:26,303
That's my Lily. She's got
a true never-say-die
attitude.

1038
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,748
Well, I'm a vampire,
dear, I can't.

1039
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,650
Eddie? Marilyn?

1040
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:34,712
(EXCLAIMS)

1041
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,150
What are you kids
doing down here?

1042
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:38,193
We're trying
to figure out

1043
01:06:38,260 --> 01:06:40,023
who trashed
Grandpa's lab.

1044
01:06:40,096 --> 01:06:41,893
Sounds like
a long shot to me.

1045
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,299
Wait a minute.

1046
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:45,891
What is it,
wolf-boy?

1047
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,230
I smell something.

1048
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,227
Elves.

1049
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,969
HERMAN: Elves did this?

1050
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,476
Santa's adorable
little mop-top elves?

1051
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,978
Santa's trusty
never-say-die helpers?

1052
01:06:58,047 --> 01:07:01,312
Well, I don't mind saying,
I feel a little bit betrayed.

1053
01:07:01,951 --> 01:07:05,216
Yeah. Well, just
imagine how poor
Santa must feel.

1054
01:07:05,287 --> 01:07:08,313
It's the night before
Christmas Eve and his
own men turned on him.

1055
01:07:08,391 --> 01:07:10,154
I wonder where those
little stinkers got to?

1056
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,057
How did this
get down here?

1057
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:13,618
Tom gave me
this flyer.

1058
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:15,254
I stuck it
on the fridge.

1059
01:07:15,331 --> 01:07:17,322
Do you think
the elves brought
it down here?

1060
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,930
Hey. Maybe
that's where
they went.

1061
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:24,862
Kids? I think it's time
we paid a visit
to Hog Heaven.

1062
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,540
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

1063
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:55,060
Are you sure this is
what the kids are wearing
these days?

1064
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,472
How are we gonna find
these two little losers?

1065
01:07:58,541 --> 01:08:00,372
Well, they don't
exactly fit in.

1066
01:08:08,484 --> 01:08:09,712
I'm glad you
could make it.

1067
01:08:09,785 --> 01:08:11,343
I'm glad to be here.

1068
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:16,619
Uh, so you guys are rehearsing
for some sort of performance
art piece? Is that it?

1069
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,157
Let me buy you
a drink. Hey!

1070
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,663
What's your poison?
Strychnine.

1071
01:08:22,731 --> 01:08:23,993
What's yours?

1072
01:08:24,066 --> 01:08:25,363
How about something
non lethal?

1073
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,629
All right.
Virgin bloody Mary.

1074
01:08:27,703 --> 01:08:29,671
Light on the
virgin's blood,
if you don't mind.

1075
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,946
Hello, boys.

1076
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,881
What? What
do you want?

1077
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,317
I think you know.

1078
01:08:44,386 --> 01:08:47,287
What we did was
between us and that
jolly old suet sack.

1079
01:08:47,356 --> 01:08:49,017
This has nothing
to do with you.

1080
01:08:51,527 --> 01:08:55,395
Hey. I thought elf tossing
was Thursday nights.

1081
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:59,296
Nothing to do with us?
You guys are ruining
Christmas.

1082
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:03,168
You have to help us change
the fruitcake back into
Santa Claus.

1083
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:07,603
Before you guys showed up,
I couldn't have cared less
about Christmas.

1084
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:10,144
But Santa showed me
how important it really is.

1085
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,079
Now thanks to you guys,
there won't even be
a Christmas.

1086
01:09:13,883 --> 01:09:15,248
Please.

1087
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,012
Don't "Oh, please" us.

1088
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,145
What you did broke
Eddie's heart.

1089
01:09:19,221 --> 01:09:22,384
And that puts you two
at the top of
my "naughty list."

1090
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,156
Now just imagine

1091
01:09:25,227 --> 01:09:27,855
all the kids in all the world
who are gonna wake up tomorrow

1092
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:30,125
and find nothing
under their trees.

1093
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:32,723
If you don't come
help us, Christmas
won't even happen.

1094
01:09:33,068 --> 01:09:36,003
Sorry, we've got
better things to do.
Right, Larry?

1095
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,436
Larry!

1096
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:42,369
Fine. Well, I hope
you two are darn
proud of yourselves.

1097
01:09:42,444 --> 01:09:43,433
Come on, kids.

1098
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,378
I've got to run because
we're, like, storming out
and everything.

1099
01:09:47,449 --> 01:09:49,815
But maybe I could
come back
and see you later.

1100
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:51,079
That is
if you didn't mind.

1101
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:54,850
Mind? I can't wait to hear
what the story is with
the little...

1102
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,257
Guys in tights.

1103
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,657
Okay.

1104
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,557
Do you think we're
being too selfish?

1105
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,655
No. I don't think
we're being selfish.

1106
01:10:04,333 --> 01:10:06,130
Everybody's entitled
to a little fun.

1107
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,369
I couldn't help
but overhear
your conversation.

1108
01:10:10,973 --> 01:10:12,304
Hot damn.

1109
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,808
I used to think short
guys were really hot.

1110
01:10:15,678 --> 01:10:17,942
I even used to have
fantasies about elves.

1111
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:22,609
But you guys are really
uncool. Shame on you
for ruining Christmas.

1112
01:10:27,723 --> 01:10:29,350
I'll make this fast,
Santa.

1113
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:31,393
You look like
you need to go out.

1114
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:38,389
(BARKING)

1115
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:47,169
Ta-da!

1116
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,076
Oh, Santa!
You fixed Santa.

1117
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:51,874
Christmas is saved.

1118
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:53,915
Not entirely,
I'm afraid.

1119
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:55,041
What do you mean?

1120
01:10:55,117 --> 01:10:57,711
It's so late,
I couldn't possibly
make it home in time,

1121
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:59,777
to load my sleigh
and make my ride.

1122
01:10:59,855 --> 01:11:02,483
Well, we could help.
I made a ducky.

1123
01:11:02,558 --> 01:11:06,085
And I'm sure that
we could find
a sleigh somewhere.

1124
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:09,095
Oh, it's more
complicated than that.

1125
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,492
I need elfin magic.

1126
01:11:13,068 --> 01:11:14,467
Elfin magic?

1127
01:11:15,170 --> 01:11:18,571
Elves are magical creatures.
They bend the laws of physics.

1128
01:11:18,641 --> 01:11:20,199
That's how I can
make millions of toys,

1129
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,643
fit them on one tiny sled
and make all my deliveries
in one night.

1130
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,274
The elves are my secret.

1131
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,178
Well, let us
be your secret.

1132
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:31,146
We can all
pitch in together.

1133
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:32,517
MARILYN: Yeah.
Thank you, Eddie.

1134
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:35,955
But this is one problem
good intentions can't solve.

1135
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:40,325
Millions of disappointed
boys and girls.

1136
01:11:41,230 --> 01:11:43,357
Start your engines,
the elves are in the house.

1137
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:45,657
What do you holiday
wreckers want?

1138
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,663
Oh, we thought about
what you said.

1139
01:11:47,736 --> 01:11:48,964
You were right.

1140
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,598
We acted like a couple
of jerks. But we want
to make up for it.

1141
01:11:51,674 --> 01:11:54,302
Besides, the babe
at the bar dissed us.

1142
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,401
But we haven't got
any toys to distribute.

1143
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,537
Got it covered.

1144
01:11:59,615 --> 01:12:03,711
How? Even with your magic,
we don't have the manpower.

1145
01:12:03,786 --> 01:12:05,720
(CHUCKLING)

1146
01:12:07,456 --> 01:12:10,050
Let's make some Christmas.

1147
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,721
(EXCLAIMING)

1148
01:12:12,961 --> 01:12:14,394
I hear you guys
needed some help.

1149
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,958
All right.

1150
01:12:19,802 --> 01:12:21,030
Where's Grandpa?

1151
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:24,595
Oh, he's down in the lab
working on something
with Lefty and Larry.

1152
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:27,164
But, at least he's
not sulking in
his coffin anymore.

1153
01:12:27,976 --> 01:12:29,307
Look up.

1154
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,405
Hope you don't mind.

1155
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:33,675
Mind?

1156
01:12:35,884 --> 01:12:37,374
I insist.

1157
01:12:40,122 --> 01:12:41,555
Oh, Eddie, look.

1158
01:12:41,623 --> 01:12:44,319
A Christmas kiss
underneath the mistletoe.

1159
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:46,653
Yuck.

1160
01:12:46,729 --> 01:12:48,094
You said it,
kid.

1161
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:51,399
(CHATTERING)

1162
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:52,932
You guys are
gonna love this.

1163
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:54,527
Now, you know me Santa,

1164
01:12:54,603 --> 01:12:57,333
I'm always on the lookout
for work-saving methods.

1165
01:12:57,406 --> 01:13:01,809
Usually hiding behind
the paint shed.
But go on.

1166
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:03,845
Well, I've been noodling
on an idea

1167
01:13:03,912 --> 01:13:06,745
that would keep us
from busting our butts
all year long.

1168
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:09,010
Ladies and gentlemen!

1169
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:10,881
Or whatever else
you consider yourselves,

1170
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:13,080
allow me to present to you,

1171
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:16,283
the Toymaster 6000.

1172
01:13:35,043 --> 01:13:38,535
With Herman Munster interface.

1173
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:40,876
LEFTY: Observe.

1174
01:13:52,528 --> 01:13:55,463
Why, this even better
than the ones back home.

1175
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,692
Still warm, too.

1176
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,292
And it can make just about
any kind of toy you want.

1177
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:02,530
All we have to do is
show Herman a picture here,

1178
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:06,131
and it comes out there.

1179
01:14:07,075 --> 01:14:08,474
How fast
can it work?

1180
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,637
Ah, we've got this baby
tweaked to the max.

1181
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:14,910
We'll have no problems
cranking out plenty of toys,
just in time for Santa's run.

1182
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,110
Great. That means we're gonna
save Christmas after all.

1183
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:19,677
Boys, I'm impressed!

1184
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:23,281
Why, if we had one
of these machines
back at the north pole,

1185
01:14:23,358 --> 01:14:26,623
we could increase
production ten times over.

1186
01:14:26,695 --> 01:14:29,493
And that would allow us
to give all you elves,

1187
01:14:29,565 --> 01:14:32,159
a couple of months
vacation every year,

1188
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,896
on the company nickel,
of course.

1189
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,198
You mean it?

1190
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:39,138
Trust me, you guys
deserve a vacation.

1191
01:14:40,275 --> 01:14:42,175
Just one thing though.

1192
01:14:42,711 --> 01:14:45,271
No more fruitcake
shenanigans.

1193
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:46,405
Deal?

1194
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:48,738
Deal.

1195
01:14:49,218 --> 01:14:51,118
It was his idea.
Shut up.

1196
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,482
You mean you want
me to do this again?

1197
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,657
Yes.

1198
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:59,785
You are coming to the
north pole next Christmas,
aren't you, Herman?

1199
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,587
Are you kidding? I'd love to.

1200
01:15:04,299 --> 01:15:07,097
What are we waiting for?
We've got a holiday to save.

(ORGAN PLAYING)

1202
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:17,973
That's the way.

1203
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,674
Well done, Tommy.
Thank you, Marilyn.

1204
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,314
How's it going, Slammer?

1205
01:15:24,386 --> 01:15:26,946
That's right. Keep it coming.
Keep it coming.

1206
01:15:27,022 --> 01:15:29,820
Oh, Lily.
Why, thank you so much.

1207
01:15:29,892 --> 01:15:31,826
Plenty more where
these came from.

1208
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,539
Randolph Derkins
gets the chemistry set.

1209
01:15:51,046 --> 01:15:52,741
Check.
Alrighty then.

1210
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:54,406
Bag the sucker.

1211
01:15:55,951 --> 01:15:56,940
I love
that trick.

1212
01:15:57,019 --> 01:15:58,008
Trade secret.

1213
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:04,788
Now, who's next?

(TIRES SCREECHING)

1215
01:16:12,868 --> 01:16:14,199
Come on, Grandpa.

1216
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:15,861
Come on, Grandpa.

1217
01:16:15,938 --> 01:16:18,566
Why is it always,
"Come on, Grandpa?"

1218
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:22,235
Why can't it be,
"Sit here and relax, Grandpa?"

1219
01:16:22,311 --> 01:16:26,771
I'm almost 800 years old.
I can't keep doing this stuff.

1220
01:16:28,283 --> 01:16:29,545
Here we are.

1221
01:16:29,618 --> 01:16:31,643
Don't you think
this is the perfect
vehicle for Santa

1222
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,813
to be making his
appointed rounds in?

1223
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,880
You're gonna get us shot.

1224
01:16:36,825 --> 01:16:38,087
Grandpa, please.

1225
01:16:38,160 --> 01:16:43,188
Now, it's not like our
domestic situation doesn't
merit a little drastic action.

1226
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:44,789
Besides,

1227
01:16:45,534 --> 01:16:49,493
it's not like we're stealing,
we're commandeering.

1228
01:16:49,571 --> 01:16:51,630
And what are you
gonna tell the cops

1229
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:56,235
when they pull us over
for commandeering
city property?

1230
01:16:56,778 --> 01:16:58,905
Well, we'll tell them
that Santa Claus needs it.

1231
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:05,415
Besides,
who can say no to Santa Claus?

You going somewhere, pops?

1233
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:33,346
Well, actually,
my son-in-law and I

1234
01:17:33,415 --> 01:17:37,476
are commandeering this
sleigh because Santa Claus

1235
01:17:37,552 --> 01:17:41,545
needs it to deliver
all his toys tonight.

1236
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,558
Uh-huh. You wanna step
out of the vehicle, sir?

1237
01:17:50,198 --> 01:17:52,063
Is there a problem, officer?

1238
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:55,001
There's no problem. No.

1239
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,595
I got no problem.
No problem with anybody.

at all. No!

all right.

Yes.

Well, that looks
like everything.
Mount up, boys.

1246
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,559
We've got a long night
ahead of us.

1247
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:27,968
You know, Santa,

1248
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:32,905
I was noticing that you've got
some extra room in the front
seat, and...

1249
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,401
Well, I was wondering,
do you ever think about

1250
01:18:35,477 --> 01:18:39,345
bringing along, you know,
an extra helper?

1251
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:43,240
Extra helper?
Why? I've got the boys.

1252
01:18:44,352 --> 01:18:46,582
Yes. Well,
it's just that I mean,

1253
01:18:46,655 --> 01:18:50,523
if you were to ever meet
someone whose lifelong
dream was

1254
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:52,526
to make your Christmas Eve
ride with you, well,

1255
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:54,653
then you'd have
a lot of room for him.

1256
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:57,995
Uh, even if
he was "heroically
proportioned."

1257
01:18:58,066 --> 01:19:00,034
Hmm, never thought of that.

1258
01:19:00,102 --> 01:19:03,401
What a wonderful idea.
Boys? Take a note.

1259
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:08,466
Starting next Christmas,
we bring along one lucky
passenger with us on our ride.

1260
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:09,966
Got you, boss.

1261
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:11,739
Thank you, Herman.

1262
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:14,781

boy or girl very happy.

for them.

Oh. It's a Santa suit.

1268
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,801
It's a uniform.

1269
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:36,736

quick if you want to come
with us tonight.

caught up in the spirit
of the season as we are?

a terrible thought.

Oh?

01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:08,333
Now that we've got the
presents, the sleigh
and the elves,

1279
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,634
how are we gonna get the
sleigh to, you know, fly?

reindeer come in, Eddie.

Don't you ever watch any of
those TV Christmas specials?

1282
01:20:18,413 --> 01:20:20,210
But we don't
have any reindeer.

1283
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,574

to have to improvise.

to improvise, Herman.

Not now, boy scout,
I am working here.

1370
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,363
I've got to tell you,
Edna, it was
close this year.

1371
01:26:11,432 --> 01:26:13,423
You and the Munsters
were neck and neck
all the way.

1372
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:16,334
Could we just get
to the part where
you announce the winner?

1373
01:26:16,404 --> 01:26:17,837
Oh, right, of course.

1374
01:26:19,307 --> 01:26:23,505
It is with great pride that
I award you, Edna Dimwitty...

1375
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:27,139
Look, it's snowing
at the Munsters.

1376
01:26:31,553 --> 01:26:32,542
Look.

1377
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:36,755
Son of a gun.
He made it snow.

1378
01:26:37,358 --> 01:26:39,553
Way to go, Santa.

1379
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:42,619
Oh, wow.
That's really pretty.

1380
01:26:42,697 --> 01:26:44,756
Excuse me?
Could we finish?

1381
01:26:44,832 --> 01:26:46,766
Pretty? It's perfect.

1382
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,768
Hello?

1383
01:26:48,836 --> 01:26:51,202
I'd like to change my vote.

1384
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:52,398
So would I.

1385
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:54,566
Well, let's get
over there.

1386
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:56,906
Oh, no. I won.

1387
01:26:57,545 --> 01:27:02,244
Oh, I was... I was gonna be
winner six years in a row.

1388
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:04,342
Congratulations, Eddie.

1389
01:27:05,186 --> 01:27:09,418
You've won first prize
in the Homeowners Association
decoration contest.

1390
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:11,557
All right.

1391
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,890
We won, Eddie. We won.

1392
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:33,344
Now, our whole family will
feel we're living in a weird
neighborhood.

1393
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:37,841
Just look
at that trophy.

1394
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:40,687
I've never won
anything before.

1395
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:43,519
You see, Eddie?
We came together,
worked hard

1396
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:45,491
and now we're the talk
of the neighborhood.

1397
01:27:45,827 --> 01:27:47,454
And the best is yet to come,
Eddie.

1398
01:27:47,528 --> 01:27:49,120
Why don't you
open your present?

1399
01:27:57,438 --> 01:28:00,168
A Marquis de Sade
Dungeon Action Playset!

1400
01:28:03,778 --> 01:28:04,904
Merry Christmas, Pop.

1401
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:08,081
Merry Christmas, Son.

1402
01:28:10,718 --> 01:28:12,549
(ORGAN PLAYING)

1403
01:28:14,188 --> 01:28:18,921
(SINGING) it's Christmas
and the graveyard folks
are coming out to play

1404
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:23,623
The skeletons and zombies
sing a ghoulish rondelet

1405
01:28:23,698 --> 01:28:25,962
The goblins wear
their jingle bells

1406
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,831
And wait for Santa's sleigh

1407
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:31,201
Good tidings
of mayhem and gore

1408
01:28:31,272 --> 01:28:32,603
Blood on the floor

1409
01:28:32,674 --> 01:28:36,508
May your Christmases
be scary evermore

1410
01:28:37,545 --> 01:28:38,671
(ALL CHEERING)

1411
01:28:38,746 --> 01:28:40,543
Merry Christmas.
Happy New Year.

1412
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,543
<i>The end.</i>
