1
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,294
Danyu!

2
00:01:51,454 --> 00:01:54,363
The grasslands have not seen such activity in a
long time

3
00:01:56,102 --> 00:01:58,933
This time when we plunder the Central Plains

4
00:01:59,825 --> 00:02:03,580
We are able join forces with all nine major tribes

5
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:07,678
Such military power has never been seen before!

6
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:08,840
Come!

7
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:10,760
Drink!

8
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:11,865
Let's drink!

9
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:15,936
Father!

10
00:02:16,646 --> 00:02:18,057
Mendu is not yet here?

11
00:02:18,144 --> 00:02:19,824
Elder Brother says he is releasing the captives

12
00:02:20,332 --> 00:02:21,207
Releasing the captives?

13
00:02:29,856 --> 00:02:31,266
Let's fight them! Don't!

14
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,093
Ashina!

15
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:39,448
Yes!

16
00:02:44,487 --> 00:02:46,053
Kill!

17
00:02:52,476 --> 00:02:53,493
Stop!

18
00:03:01,884 --> 00:03:02,979
Danyu!

19
00:03:03,075 --> 00:03:03,833
Danyu!

20
00:03:03,997 --> 00:03:07,288
Brother! Is killing defenseless prisoners...

21
00:03:07,374 --> 00:03:08,439
...the act of a hero?.

22
00:03:10,679 --> 00:03:12,474
They are all sheep already in my mouth.

23
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,623
I will eat them however I please

24
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,735
Our days are numbered

25
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:19,424
We must be back on the grasslands

26
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,921
by the first snow

27
00:03:21,007 --> 00:03:23,611
Father, plundering the Plains every year...

28
00:03:23,697 --> 00:03:25,069
... is not a long term plan

29
00:03:25,425 --> 00:03:26,837
Instead of being divided and defeated

30
00:03:26,923 --> 00:03:28,180
by the Wei army for robbery,

31
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:30,215
why don't we take advantage of the united forces

32
00:03:30,301 --> 00:03:32,558
we have this time, and turn the fertile Wei
farmlands...

33
00:03:32,644 --> 00:03:33,862
... into our new ranch!

34
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:40,775
Of course, it is all up to you,

35
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:43,156
for you are the true master of the grasslands.

36
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:48,226
Mendu! Don't kill prisoners any more!

37
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:50,339
Yes, sir!

38
00:03:57,336 --> 00:03:59,795
Only longtime veterans understand

39
00:04:00,601 --> 00:04:04,317
that there are no heroes on the battlefield,

40
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:09,346
only dead men and crazy ones

41
00:04:09,548 --> 00:04:10,920
Talking about feeling?.

42
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,918
Fools!

43
00:04:13,275 --> 00:04:15,952
But if not for you, none of us would be here

44
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:18,563
You are the one who lives by his feelings!

45
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,099
Father, time for your medicine!

46
00:04:21,646 --> 00:04:22,664
I don't want medicine

47
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:24,507
I want to drink wine!

48
00:04:25,255 --> 00:04:27,934
Sure. Let me pour for you.

49
00:04:35,892 --> 00:04:36,959
Here!

50
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:40,606
I don't want this one, I want that one

51
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,706
It's still medicine!

52
00:04:52,174 --> 00:04:54,930
Go for the weakness, use the enemy against
himself,

53
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:58,041
Mulan is using battle tactics on her father!

54
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:01,075
It's all your fault!

55
00:05:01,468 --> 00:05:03,226
Why did you teach her kung fu?.

56
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,606
Waving her stick around all day

57
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:07,219
She's a girl!

58
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:10,178
Who will marry her?.

59
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:11,904
Grandfather!

60
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,133
Hi, Tiger! Sister Mulan!

61
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:14,976
How long has it been since you practiced kung
fu?.

62
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:16,973
I practiced yesterday and today!

63
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,316
I didn't see you; when did you practice?.

64
00:05:19,824 --> 00:05:23,156
From when the cock started crowing to when it
stopped

65
00:05:23,242 --> 00:05:24,309
so it counted as both days!

66
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:27,458
You brat!

67
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:28,187
Mulan!

68
00:05:44,287 --> 00:05:46,571
The Rourans are at our border. Massive troops
are needed for our defense

69
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,925
Military families from all villages. Heed the
Emperor's command!

70
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,736
Farmer families contribute food. Military families
contribute men

71
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,799
With united spirit. We will defeat the dog
invaders!

72
00:05:58,919 --> 00:05:59,937
Cao Dayou!

73
00:06:00,033 --> 00:06:00,829
Here!

74
00:06:01,684 --> 00:06:02,518
Hua Hu!

75
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:03,365
Here!

76
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,438
Father! You are ill, you can't go!

77
00:06:05,524 --> 00:06:07,050
No such thing! This is a military family's duty!

78
00:06:07,137 --> 00:06:07,934
Yang Ji!

79
00:06:08,021 --> 00:06:08,586
Here!

80
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,419
Yang Wencai!

81
00:06:12,515 --> 00:06:13,272
Here!

82
00:06:13,473 --> 00:06:14,691
Ma Wen!

83
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:15,345
Here!

84
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:45,836
Old partner,

85
00:06:48,265 --> 00:06:50,474
it's our turn to go...

86
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,057
to the frontlines again!

87
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,391
Father,

88
00:07:02,245 --> 00:07:03,309
have some more wine

89
00:07:17,105 --> 00:07:18,938
I have some money stashed away

90
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:22,357
in the jar under the bed.

91
00:07:31,968 --> 00:07:34,684
Master Ho found you a husband.

92
00:07:35,232 --> 00:07:38,140
Get married after the new year.

93
00:07:43,105 --> 00:07:48,165
Don't do martial arts any more. You're a girl...

94
00:07:59,885 --> 00:08:01,144
One day,

95
00:08:03,111 --> 00:08:06,329
you will find a new star in the sky.

96
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:10,706
That would be me

97
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:17,966
Your mother's been up there for so long

98
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,796
She must be lonely...

99
00:09:17,689 --> 00:09:20,101
Mulan! Help me!

100
00:09:20,187 --> 00:09:21,021
Here I come, Tiger!

101
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:34,232
I have failed to discipline my daughter; l
apologize for her

102
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:43,063
The Hua family has only known how to fight in
battles!

103
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:49,284
If you want to fight...

104
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,626
be a man in your next life

105
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:23,271

00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:44,276
Go!

112
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:46,966
Remember

113
00:10:47,052 --> 00:10:49,577
These tags must always be kept on you.

114
00:10:49,664 --> 00:10:52,149
They will represent you when you are dead.
Understand?.

115
00:10:52,237 --> 00:10:52,957
Yes, sir!

116
00:10:55,425 --> 00:10:56,258
Names

117
00:10:56,344 --> 00:10:57,103
Fei Tiger

118
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:59,138
Hua Hu's son, Hua Mulan

119
00:11:00,186 --> 00:11:01,020
Pay attention!

120
00:11:01,837 --> 00:11:02,710
Thank you!

121
00:11:06,944 --> 00:11:08,662
Get your uniforms and go to Tent Three

122
00:11:11,361 --> 00:11:12,301
Hua Mulan?.

123
00:11:13,012 --> 00:11:13,731
Yes

124
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:19,799
You! Why are you here?.

125
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:22,794
I took my father's place

126
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,716
You didn't!

127
00:11:26,799 --> 00:11:28,401
Tiger! Tiger!

128
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:29,629
Tiger!

129
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:31,974
Women are not allowed at camp.

130
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,049
It's punishable by death!

131
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,122
Are you trying to destroy our whole village?.

132
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:37,272
So you must keep our secret

133
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:39,424
You want me to go see my dad sooner, don't
you?.

134
00:11:40,316 --> 00:11:43,302
Tiger, you must help me!

135
00:11:43,388 --> 00:11:46,527
You know my dad; he would never survive this!

136
00:11:46,613 --> 00:11:47,986
But...

137
00:11:48,073 --> 00:11:51,904
Fei Tiger! Come here!

138
00:11:55,678 --> 00:11:56,696
Will you do as I ask?.

139
00:11:58,978 --> 00:11:59,997
Sure!

140
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,502
I knew you would do this!

141
00:12:03,434 --> 00:12:04,807
I will do anything you ask

142
00:12:04,894 --> 00:12:06,611
But you must so as I say on one matter.

143
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:08,993
Talk less, laugh less

144
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,453
Why?.

145
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:13,370
You laugh like this...

146
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,481
We laugh like this.

147
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,974
Also, don't open your eyes so wide!

148
00:12:22,904 --> 00:12:23,921
Why not?.

149
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:26,544
Our eyes are not that big!

150
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,080
You mean, your eyes are small

151
00:12:29,087 --> 00:12:30,228
Your eyes are too big!

152
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:31,946
Hey

153
00:12:35,269 --> 00:12:38,408
From now on, you must all obey me!

154
00:12:38,802 --> 00:12:39,637
Brother Tiger!

155
00:12:40,146 --> 00:12:42,404
I heard he's the Commander's nephew,

156
00:12:42,566 --> 00:12:44,207
Hu Guei

157
00:12:45,331 --> 00:12:46,205
Bai!

158
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:47,089
Brother Tiger!

159
00:12:47,175 --> 00:12:47,932
This is Mulan

160
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,122
Scholar!

161
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:50,544
Fatso! Brother Tiger!

162
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:51,428
This is Mulan

163
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:52,580
Come

164
00:12:53,089 --> 00:12:55,651
Hulu! This is Mulan

165
00:12:55,738 --> 00:12:56,497
Hello, Brother Munan

166
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:59,378
We want to trade beds with you

167
00:12:59,465 --> 00:13:00,722
Why?.

168
00:13:00,808 --> 00:13:03,831
Mulan likes quieter spots against the wall

169
00:13:03,917 --> 00:13:04,637
Sure

170
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,404
Sit down, gamble with Young Master!

171
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,585
I need a leopard!

172
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:08,440
Bring him!

173
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:09,283
Kill!

174
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:12,653
Out of the mud from the grey,

175
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:15,352
comes a turtle called Hu Guei!

176
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,541
Let's call him Turtle from now on!

177
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:18,885
Yes! We'll call him Turtle!

178
00:13:22,467 --> 00:13:24,799
Training is over. Go back to your tents!

179
00:13:28,995 --> 00:13:32,020
Black Wind! Will Father blame me

180
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:34,581
for leaving without saying goodbye?.

181
00:13:36,638 --> 00:13:40,237
All the crooks and heroes in the camp, officers
protecting their own,

182
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:45,191
with Father's temper, he couldn't take it

183
00:13:46,468 --> 00:13:47,408
Right?.

184
00:13:48,503 --> 00:13:49,416
Wrong!

185
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,437
You're a rookie?. What's your name?.

186
00:14:04,016 --> 00:14:05,006
So...

187
00:14:05,936 --> 00:14:08,616
you only talk to horses?.

188
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,420
But I don't eavesdrop

189
00:14:17,382 --> 00:14:20,675
Then think of me as a horse. I'm Wentai.

190
00:14:21,759 --> 00:14:24,898
My horse is Moon Chaser. What's yours called?.

191
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:31,119
He is Black Wind!

192
00:14:31,707 --> 00:14:32,580
Black Wind...

193
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:34,577
and you?.

194
00:14:36,122 --> 00:14:37,138
I'm Hua Mulan

195
00:14:37,503 --> 00:14:38,300
What a great horse!

196
00:14:40,154 --> 00:14:41,095
Help me! Come here!

197
00:14:43,571 --> 00:14:46,672
My horse is amazing. It is a war hero!

198
00:14:46,758 --> 00:14:47,557
Really?.

199
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:48,738
Do you know what it is called?.

200
00:14:48,834 --> 00:14:49,591
What?.

201
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:50,436
Hua Mulan

202
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:52,769
Come, Wentai!

203
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:55,812
Come, Hua Mulan!

204
00:15:07,535 --> 00:15:08,407
Brother Mulan!

205
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:09,522
This is Wentai

206
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:11,212
I'm Tiger

207
00:15:11,567 --> 00:15:12,509
I'm Wentai

208
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,437
I'm older brother Fatso

209
00:15:15,022 --> 00:15:16,118
I'm younger brother Hulu

210
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:17,509
Hello! I'm Scholar

211
00:15:17,596 --> 00:15:18,509
Hello!

212
00:15:18,673 --> 00:15:19,660
What are you painting?.

213
00:15:19,747 --> 00:15:21,389
My wife

214
00:15:21,475 --> 00:15:23,655
You're already married?. I though you were
painting him!

215
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,804
I am the only son in my family,

216
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,254
so Father let me marry young.

217
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:29,838
Paint my picture!

218
00:15:30,653 --> 00:15:32,603
Should I smile or not?.

219
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,753
Just as you are!

220
00:15:38,718 --> 00:15:40,205
Crying again?.

221
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:43,816
You're an enlisted man! So you die;

222
00:15:43,903 --> 00:15:44,813
why are you always crying?.

223
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:47,771
Bai here sold himself to the landlord next door

224
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:52,455
to enlist in place of his son, in order to raise
money

225
00:15:52,658 --> 00:15:55,990
for his mother's medicine. But she is still sick now

226
00:15:56,345 --> 00:15:58,869
I lost again! You bastard!

227
00:15:58,956 --> 00:16:00,214
You cried away my leopard!

228
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:03,180
What are you crying for! Did your mother die?.

229
00:16:03,487 --> 00:16:05,744
What did you say?. Do not talk about my mother!

230
00:16:07,635 --> 00:16:08,510
What are you doing?.

231
00:16:31,675 --> 00:16:33,739
Sir, please spare my life!

232
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,660
If you must fight,

233
00:16:35,438 --> 00:16:36,658
do so on the battlefield!

234
00:16:39,509 --> 00:16:40,804
My Brother Mulan!

235
00:16:41,352 --> 00:16:44,876
My father is sick, too. But we can't go back!

236
00:16:46,268 --> 00:16:49,253
Your mother knows what a good son you are.
She will wait for you!

237
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:51,318
Brother Wentai

238
00:16:52,065 --> 00:16:53,160
I'm done!

239
00:16:54,984 --> 00:16:55,782
Thank you!

240
00:16:57,251 --> 00:16:58,124
Repel!

241
00:16:58,864 --> 00:16:59,659
Advance!

242
00:17:00,362 --> 00:17:01,158
Attack!

243
00:17:02,051 --> 00:17:02,925
You're killing me!

244
00:17:03,473 --> 00:17:04,269
Advance!

245
00:17:05,201 --> 00:17:05,919
Attack!

246
00:17:06,813 --> 00:17:07,609
Repel!

247
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,223
Advance!

248
00:17:09,963 --> 00:17:10,952
Attack!

249
00:17:11,499 --> 00:17:12,294
Repel!

250
00:17:12,842 --> 00:17:13,637
Advance!

251
00:17:14,953 --> 00:17:15,752
Attack!

252
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:17,441
Repel!

253
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:19,015
Attack!

254
00:17:30,008 --> 00:17:32,494
Tiger, didn't you say you found a hot spring?.

255
00:17:33,426 --> 00:17:34,223
Take me there!

256
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,416
Which battalion do you belong to?.

257
00:17:53,856 --> 00:17:54,922
I'm asking you!

258
00:18:05,645 --> 00:18:06,557
A woman?.

259
00:18:11,675 --> 00:18:12,665
You're a woman!

260
00:18:30,953 --> 00:18:31,826
Tiger

261
00:18:33,256 --> 00:18:35,715
I ran into Wentai!

262
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:38,576
How did you do that?.

263
00:18:40,053 --> 00:18:42,157
I fought with him in the hot spring!

264
00:18:43,934 --> 00:18:45,306
Did he recognize you?.

265
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,413
I think he just knows it's a woman

266
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:51,249
Well, then...go to sleep...

267
00:19:01,482 --> 00:19:02,501
Get up!

268
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:10,536
Fall in!

269
00:19:14,617 --> 00:19:18,293
Uncle, it was stolen when I was training with
them!

270
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:21,443
The Prince Regent's jade belt pendant has been
stolen!

271
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,514
Return it now, I'll only cut off your hand.

272
00:19:24,868 --> 00:19:26,040
If I find it on you,

273
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:28,046
I'll cut off your head!

274
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:29,890
Search them!

275
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,073
Strip down!

276
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,527
Now! Hurry! What are you looking at?. Strip down!

277
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,332
Hurry! Quit messing around! Strip down now!

278
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:44,868
You! What are you waiting for?. Hurry!

279
00:19:45,223 --> 00:19:46,290
Yes, you! Now!

280
00:19:48,678 --> 00:19:49,475
Hurry!

281
00:19:51,712 --> 00:19:52,702
All clothes off!

282
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:56,425
Strip down!

283
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:03,800
You in the back! Hurry!

284
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:06,824
What are you waiting for! Pants off! All off!

285
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,063
Clothes off! Hurry!

286
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,292
Strip down!

287
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:11,979
Strip down! Strip down!

288
00:20:14,984 --> 00:20:15,926
I stole it!

289
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:19,085
Bring him here!

290
00:20:25,469 --> 00:20:26,640
Where is the pendant?.

291
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:28,531
I lost it

292
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:29,606
Lost it?.

293
00:20:31,306 --> 00:20:32,524
He must have sold it!

294
00:20:33,456 --> 00:20:34,599
Where is it?.

295
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:37,161
I forgot

296
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:38,351
Take him out to be executed!

297
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:39,323
Commander,

298
00:20:39,831 --> 00:20:42,357
we should investigate this first!

299
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:44,659
Execution is tomorrow at noon!

300
00:20:57,842 --> 00:20:59,713
Where can it be?. What am I to do!

301
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:32,586
I know you didn't steal the pendant.

302
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,385
What's going on?.

303
00:21:45,461 --> 00:21:46,680
My father is very sick,

304
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:51,059
so I dressed up as a boy to take his place

305
00:21:59,745 --> 00:22:00,812
How can I help you?.

306
00:22:02,088 --> 00:22:03,029
Please

307
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:06,717
don't let him know

308
00:22:09,577 --> 00:22:10,519
I didn't...

309
00:22:12,149 --> 00:22:13,524
die in combat!

310
00:22:21,982 --> 00:22:22,895
Have some soup

311
00:22:39,223 --> 00:22:40,673
From the day I entered camp

312
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,783
I've had nightmares every night

313
00:22:47,942 --> 00:22:49,113
Please,

314
00:22:51,358 --> 00:22:53,193
personally burn my corpse

315
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,187
Don't let anyone else find out!

316
00:22:57,579 --> 00:23:00,144
I promise to burn your nightmares

317
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:22,762
Thank you

318
00:23:46,197 --> 00:23:47,034
Leave us!

319
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:47,801
Yes, sir!

320
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:56,058
It's a Rouran attack! Get out!

321
00:23:56,261 --> 00:23:57,095
Run!

322
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:08,461
Run!

323
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,110
How will you justify letting me go?.

324
00:24:12,196 --> 00:24:15,413
This is war. There aren't so many consequences.

325
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:16,526
Go!

326
00:25:15,406 --> 00:25:17,240
Commander!

327
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,356
Commander!

328
00:25:47,472 --> 00:25:48,269
Thank you!

329
00:25:53,848 --> 00:25:54,942
Mulan! Mulan!

330
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:05,510
Rush over! Kill their General!

331
00:26:36,128 --> 00:26:37,269
Chop!

332
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:38,566
Chop off his head!

333
00:26:39,585 --> 00:26:40,958
That is the rule!

334
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:50,711
The Rouran General is dead!

335
00:26:50,798 --> 00:26:52,362
Kill them!

336
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:05,496
Retreat! Now!

337
00:27:15,413 --> 00:27:17,477
Hurry! Bring him here! Now!

338
00:27:19,023 --> 00:27:20,282
Stay calm!

339
00:27:23,287 --> 00:27:24,698
Prepare the bandages! Yes, sir!

340
00:27:40,758 --> 00:27:42,095
Uncle!

341
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:45,731
What shall I do without you?.

342
00:27:45,827 --> 00:27:46,769
You still have us

343
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:53,691
Come on

344
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:00,249
Salute!

345
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:08,554
A century of human life is like a dream

346
00:28:09,099 --> 00:28:15,311
Life and death occur, heroes have no regrets

347
00:28:16,243 --> 00:28:22,147
Protect my homeland, show off my nation's pride

348
00:28:23,654 --> 00:28:26,870
What joy is there in life...

349
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:29,137
Mulan, you can be a talented general!

350
00:28:29,492 --> 00:28:31,701
I'll keep your identity secret

351
00:28:32,641 --> 00:28:33,515
Stay on

352
00:28:39,785 --> 00:28:41,118
I don't want their families

353
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:45,342
to feel even worse when they see the blood.

354
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,142
Come!

355
00:28:54,031 --> 00:28:55,126
I'm actually very afraid of blood!

356
00:28:56,604 --> 00:28:57,823
My father dislikes me

357
00:28:59,406 --> 00:29:02,701
He said I would amount to nothing since I couldn't
even bear to kill a rabbit,

358
00:29:03,057 --> 00:29:04,275
and kicked me out of the house

359
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:08,759
You weren't afraid,

360
00:29:10,314 --> 00:29:11,255
you just couldn't bear to!

361
00:29:15,576 --> 00:29:16,486
You're right.

362
00:29:20,183 --> 00:29:22,055
So I worked hard to excel

363
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:24,436
so I can show him

364
00:29:25,866 --> 00:29:27,508
I used to hate him,

365
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:33,192
but now I understand he was just training me

366
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,031
I have my own way

367
00:29:38,116 --> 00:29:41,181
I imagine my fear is a person

368
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,214
Then I shout at him,

369
00:29:44,413 --> 00:29:45,480
I'm not afraid of you!

370
00:29:46,296 --> 00:29:47,392
And I'm not!

371
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,044
I'm not afraid of you!

372
00:29:59,546 --> 00:30:00,563
What did you say?.

373
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,532
Nothing!

374
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,807
In the third year of our Emperor's rule, our nation
lost a hero

375
00:30:23,623 --> 00:30:25,648
Commander Feng died for the country

376
00:30:26,313 --> 00:30:29,912
The Emperor commands Wentai to be
Commander

377
00:30:30,114 --> 00:30:31,678
Hua Mulan to be Sub-Commander

378
00:30:32,033 --> 00:30:35,711
and hopes they will lead the 6th Battalion to
serve the country.

379
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:42,998
The Rouran Price Mendu has gathered all the
tribes

380
00:30:43,172 --> 00:30:44,852
I fear a major battle is imminent!

381
00:30:45,207 --> 00:30:48,153
I hereby command all battalions to attack

382
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,959
to weaken the Rouran forces!

383
00:30:51,695 --> 00:30:52,838
Go forth!

384
00:31:17,579 --> 00:31:19,988
Big Brother!

385
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,966
The Emperor commands that,

386
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:37,462
for their wartime accomplishments,

387
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,380
Wentai is to be made General of Conquering
North

388
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:43,413
Hua Mulan to be made General of Pacifying North

389
00:31:43,615 --> 00:31:47,755
and hopes these heroes will fight to protect our
homeland!

390
00:32:32,195 --> 00:32:33,567
I finally understand

391
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,563
why Father said...

392
00:32:38,146 --> 00:32:39,981
we must not have feelings on the battlefield!

393
00:32:54,776 --> 00:32:56,533
We were rewarded and made Generals

394
00:32:59,422 --> 00:33:01,410
but who will reward them?.

395
00:33:09,444 --> 00:33:11,240
When I was a child, Father said

396
00:33:12,249 --> 00:33:16,963
when people die, they will become stars in the
sky!

397
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:26,832
Danyu! Wei generals Hua Mulan and Wentai
soundly defeated Bawuyi!

398
00:33:28,492 --> 00:33:29,903
Hua Mulan and Wentai again!

399
00:33:33,947 --> 00:33:40,542
So the Wei nation still has generals as fierce as
tigers!

400
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,614
Father

401
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,763
A wolf can kill one sheep.

402
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,980
But ten wolves can eat a tiger!

403
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:55,710
I beg you not to split up our forces again!

404
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:10,112
The Rouran nation was established 1 50 years
ago.

405
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:14,758
We have fewer and fewer tribesmen. It's a hard
life

406
00:34:17,148 --> 00:34:18,023
Father

407
00:34:20,297 --> 00:34:22,440
I want to be a queen of Wei

408
00:34:24,177 --> 00:34:26,162
If I were queen,

409
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:28,699
We can become friends with the Central people

410
00:34:28,785 --> 00:34:31,502
We can trade our pelts and horses...

411
00:34:31,588 --> 00:34:32,998
for their salt and iron.

412
00:34:33,392 --> 00:34:34,843
Wouldn't that be good?.

413
00:34:37,886 --> 00:34:39,758
If you didn't have an older brother,

414
00:34:40,574 --> 00:34:43,943
you would be the future Danyu, Master of the
Grasslands.

415
00:34:47,603 --> 00:34:48,619
Danyu!

416
00:34:50,597 --> 00:34:53,584
Child, I gave you your freedom long ago,

417
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:57,154
yet you stayed to be with me all these years

418
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,841
I hope, when I die,

419
00:35:02,002 --> 00:35:04,364
to be buried to the sound of your singing

420
00:35:05,535 --> 00:35:09,597
Then you should bring your tribesmen home

421
00:35:12,717 --> 00:35:15,819
The Rourans should have a friend.

422
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,995
General Hua! General Wentai was ambushed
when he was scouting up ahead.

423
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:27,721
He orders that you remain here to await his
command, and guard the supplies!

424
00:35:29,690 --> 00:35:30,988
Scholar!

425
00:35:31,918 --> 00:35:32,715
Yes, General?.

426
00:35:32,802 --> 00:35:33,597
Stay here and guard the supplies!

427
00:35:33,684 --> 00:35:34,328
Yes, sir!

428
00:35:34,453 --> 00:35:35,440
All cavalrymen, come with me!

429
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:37,736
General Hua!

430
00:35:37,832 --> 00:35:39,551
General Wen asked you to remain where you
were!

431
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,777
All supply wagons, go over there!

432
00:35:53,116 --> 00:35:54,181
Retreat!

433
00:35:58,875 --> 00:35:59,894
Don't chase them!

434
00:36:03,292 --> 00:36:04,589
Why are you here?.

435
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:05,971
I was worried about you!

436
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:11,271
Let's go!

437
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,946
General Hua,

438
00:36:23,032 --> 00:36:25,210
as soon as you left, we were ambushed!

439
00:36:28,064 --> 00:36:28,821
Scholar!

440
00:36:30,096 --> 00:36:33,121
Scholar!

441
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:34,619
Scholar!

442
00:36:37,317 --> 00:36:39,035
Scholar! Hang on!

443
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,802
Hang in there,

444
00:36:42,156 --> 00:36:43,069
Scholar!

445
00:36:43,883 --> 00:36:47,253
Your wife is waiting for you at home! Hang on!

446
00:36:49,223 --> 00:36:51,862
I'm not married...

447
00:36:52,064 --> 00:36:53,321
Before I left...

448
00:36:53,676 --> 00:36:57,124
I promised my father...when I went back

449
00:36:57,671 --> 00:36:58,843
I would give him a grandson...

450
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:02,959
General!

451
00:37:04,968 --> 00:37:08,030
I failed to protect the supplies...sorry!

452
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:11,294
Bring me back...to my father...

453
00:37:12,608 --> 00:37:13,598
I'm sorry...

454
00:37:16,564 --> 00:37:17,362
Scholar!

455
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:19,818
Scholar!

456
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,700
Scholar!

457
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:27,193
I'm sorry...

458
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,946
Where else do you want to go?.

459
00:37:37,033 --> 00:37:38,368
To find them!

460
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:42,659
Your short temper in battle, caused the death of
so many of our men,

461
00:37:42,832 --> 00:37:44,004
can you see that?.

462
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:54,487
It's all my fault!

463
00:37:57,846 --> 00:37:59,257
It's all on me!

464
00:38:00,805 --> 00:38:02,177
I shouldn't have gone to you,

465
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:07,245
but I was terrified...

466
00:38:09,445 --> 00:38:10,933
that you wouldn't come back...

467
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,734
I've lost so many brothers,

468
00:38:17,777 --> 00:38:19,266
I can't bear to lose you!

469
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:27,753
Your father was right

470
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,974
We cannot develop feelings in battle

471
00:38:34,369 --> 00:38:35,625
If you were me...

472
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,224
wouldn't you have come?.

473
00:38:56,027 --> 00:38:57,045
I wouldn't

474
00:39:43,377 --> 00:39:45,785
Why was Father so excited to talk about war?.

475
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,087
I've fought battle after battle,

476
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:54,005
Lost one after another of my brothers,

477
00:39:57,164 --> 00:39:58,575
I really don't want to fight any more.

478
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:06,372
Everyone is awaiting their General to lead them
to battle!

479
00:40:18,553 --> 00:40:19,925
I don't want to fight any more

480
00:40:22,049 --> 00:40:23,458
I don't want to be a General

481
00:40:24,928 --> 00:40:26,569
I want to be a normal person!

482
00:40:27,386 --> 00:40:28,404
Who wants to fight!

483
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,407
I also don't want to fight any more!

484
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,436
If I could use my life to stop this battle,

485
00:40:40,365 --> 00:40:41,537
I would have done it long ago!

486
00:40:47,163 --> 00:40:51,108
The problem is, we cannot choose!

487
00:40:57,992 --> 00:40:59,480
Once you put on a General's armor,

488
00:41:02,447 --> 00:41:03,590
Your life is no longer your own

489
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,815
This is what war is about!

490
00:41:17,769 --> 00:41:18,759
Stay,

491
00:41:21,110 --> 00:41:22,281
just this once!

492
00:41:51,372 --> 00:41:52,784
Ambush!

493
00:42:11,727 --> 00:42:12,714
Brother Wentai!

494
00:42:21,019 --> 00:42:21,958
General!

495
00:42:53,852 --> 00:42:56,876
Before Brother Wentai died, he asked me to give
you this.

496
00:43:05,144 --> 00:43:06,823
He told you to never give up

497
00:44:30,664 --> 00:44:33,420
If we steal and drink the army's wine, we'll be
whipped!

498
00:44:33,852 --> 00:44:36,761
We won't; who rules over us now?.

499
00:44:37,117 --> 00:44:38,644
True; General Wen is gone

500
00:44:39,191 --> 00:44:41,101
and General Hua has not trained us in a long
time

501
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,020
Don't worry, drink up!

502
00:44:45,105 --> 00:44:46,900
General Hua! General Hua!

503
00:44:58,698 --> 00:44:59,495
Okay's we're fine

504
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,137
See, I told you no one cares!

505
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:03,479
Keep drinking!

506
00:45:03,999 --> 00:45:04,871
Keep drinking!

507
00:45:24,082 --> 00:45:27,223
Sir, General Hua has not trained us in a long time

508
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:30,947
The General has ordered training to cease

509
00:45:35,527 --> 00:45:37,667
Let's train together! Get up!

510
00:45:38,022 --> 00:45:41,199
What's the use?. The General doesn't care any
more

511
00:45:41,365 --> 00:45:43,006
Do we still have a General?.

512
00:45:43,092 --> 00:45:44,033
What did you say?.

513
00:45:44,437 --> 00:45:45,607
Turtle!

514
00:45:45,934 --> 00:45:47,537
Let's train by ourselves!

515
00:46:33,744 --> 00:46:34,619
What are you doing?.

516
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:39,062
Give it back!

517
00:46:39,159 --> 00:46:41,368
Are you living for the dead, or for the living?.

518
00:46:41,732 --> 00:46:42,750
Give it back!

519
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:48,328
There are things you must do!

520
00:46:50,795 --> 00:46:52,207
It is your duty!

521
00:47:05,234 --> 00:47:07,300
You are no longer the Sister Mulan I adored!

522
00:47:18,176 --> 00:47:20,164
Because you wanted to escape, you caused the
death of Brother Wentai,

523
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:23,812
And you will cause the death of many of our
brothers in the future!

524
00:47:25,434 --> 00:47:26,654
You are so selfish!

525
00:47:32,154 --> 00:47:35,024
He really wanted to see you become a good
leader.

526
00:47:35,534 --> 00:47:37,637
If he sees what you have become,

527
00:47:38,183 --> 00:47:39,356
he will be so disappointed!

528
00:48:53,529 --> 00:48:54,403
Tiger!

529
00:49:20,412 --> 00:49:21,668
Fall in!

530
00:49:28,361 --> 00:49:29,888
The General Hua you see before you

531
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:34,138
is actually terrified of battle.

532
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:40,283
I had been afraid and hiding all along.

533
00:49:41,417 --> 00:49:42,512
But...

534
00:49:45,834 --> 00:49:47,552
I never thought my fear and hiding

535
00:49:52,707 --> 00:49:55,425
would cause the loss of the most important friend
in my life

536
00:49:56,971 --> 00:50:00,571
His departure lets me understand

537
00:50:02,193 --> 00:50:05,666
fleeing from the endless battles

538
00:50:06,992 --> 00:50:10,862
only makes us lose even more!

539
00:50:15,056 --> 00:50:19,772
From now on, I will become stronger,

540
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,420
and protect each one of you!

541
00:50:24,235 --> 00:50:28,603
And you must all become stronger

542
00:50:28,805 --> 00:50:30,523
to protect those near you!

543
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:33,366
Will you do that?.

544
00:50:34,106 --> 00:50:35,516
Hail, General Hua!

545
00:50:35,871 --> 00:50:37,013
Hail, the Wei army!

546
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:55,063
Hail, General Hua!

547
00:51:05,558 --> 00:51:06,544
Brother Wentai!

548
00:51:14,811 --> 00:51:16,607
No matter if I live or die,

549
00:51:17,345 --> 00:51:20,216
tell Mulan I have died!

550
00:51:20,763 --> 00:51:23,221
Her emotional tie must be cut before

551
00:51:23,874 --> 00:51:25,748
she can really grow strong

552
00:51:27,907 --> 00:51:30,740
Promise me!

553
00:51:30,826 --> 00:51:31,468
All right

554
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,672
In the sixth year of the Emperor's rule, General
Hua led 5,000 soldiers

555
00:51:49,834 --> 00:51:52,196
to lure the Rourans across the river

556
00:51:52,292 --> 00:51:55,921
He ordered his men to destroy a dyke upstream.
Countless enemy soldiers were washed away

557
00:51:56,132 --> 00:51:58,888
We killed 1 0,000 of the enemy with no loss of life!

558
00:51:59,781 --> 00:52:02,066
In the seventh year, he chased the enemy for
300 miles

559
00:52:02,392 --> 00:52:03,458
It was snowing

560
00:52:04,042 --> 00:52:05,647
The enemy thought we had retreated

561
00:52:06,003 --> 00:52:07,875
But General Hua disregarded the hardships

562
00:52:08,345 --> 00:52:10,907
and tracked them down to their hiding place,
attacked when they were unprepared,

563
00:52:11,262 --> 00:52:13,672
killed 20,000, and took 3,000 prisoners!

564
00:52:14,643 --> 00:52:17,589
The Rouran quake at the sound of his name!

565
00:52:18,137 --> 00:52:20,123
Also, when General Hua goes to battle,

566
00:52:20,289 --> 00:52:22,237
he always stands in front of his soldiers

567
00:52:22,554 --> 00:52:25,233
His men are so moved, they will gladly die for
him!

568
00:52:26,201 --> 00:52:29,033
When he sees other battalions in trouble, he will
always help them

569
00:52:29,581 --> 00:52:32,682
So among the Wei army, he inspires confidence,

570
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,408
And is well-respected.

571
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:41,092
In the eighth year, General Hua led 3,000 men...

572
00:52:41,178 --> 00:52:41,897
Enough!

573
00:52:42,253 --> 00:52:45,394
Say no more. Demoted to the cooking team!

574
00:52:45,941 --> 00:52:48,301
Why are you demoting General Hua to the
cooking team?.

575
00:52:48,513 --> 00:52:49,962
I meant you!

576
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:51,654
Remove him! Yes, sir!

577
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:52,574
Commander-in-chief, sir!

578
00:52:55,886 --> 00:52:59,680
We can have wine if we win! Come!

579
00:53:00,187 --> 00:53:02,522
General Hua! You are a great guy!

580
00:53:02,608 --> 00:53:03,865
I want to be your sworn brother!

581
00:53:03,951 --> 00:53:05,323
Sorry, General Hua! He's drunk

582
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:07,744
General Hua, I'm not drunk!

583
00:53:08,598 --> 00:53:09,616
General Hua!

584
00:53:17,890 --> 00:53:19,840
Let's tell her the truth

585
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:22,259
No!

586
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:24,794
Now the army's morale is strong

587
00:53:25,341 --> 00:53:27,800
and it all hinges on her!

588
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:29,863
I always hoped...

589
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:33,665
her heart would harden

590
00:53:34,482 --> 00:53:36,353
And not be bothered by matters of emotion

591
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:41,731
As long as the Rourans still live, we do not have
a home

592
00:53:43,044 --> 00:53:44,061
The nation's business is more important than our
own

593
00:53:47,422 --> 00:53:48,441
You two are so lonely!

594
00:53:50,378 --> 00:53:53,633
Chiefs Futu, Shelun and Buluzhen are outside,

595
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,093
waiting to bid farewell to Your Highness

596
00:53:56,256 --> 00:53:57,051
Your Highness!

597
00:53:58,060 --> 00:53:59,546
My tribe lost badly in the Battle of Buhe,
