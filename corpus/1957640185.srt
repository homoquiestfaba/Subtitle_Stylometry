3
00:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,288
What did you want?

4
00:00:23,758 --> 00:00:24,659
Is this okay?

5
00:00:27,127 --> 00:00:29,096
My, my zoom camera is...

6
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:35,035
We met through our fathers,

7
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:38,372
because our fathers
were good friends.

8
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,210
My sister-in-law's mother

9
00:00:43,243 --> 00:00:46,681
arranged a meeting
between Tanya and me.

10
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:51,418
I finished my university
education and got my first job.

11
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,322
And this is when my
uncle actually asked me,

12
00:00:55,355 --> 00:00:58,191
"Are you ready to get married?"

13
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:00,193
You know, "Can you
look for somebody?"

14
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,663
We first met on Shaadi.com,

15
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,767
basically the Indian
version of Match.com.

16
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,335
And it was a very
common matrimonial site.

17
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:11,171
So arranged
marriages are usually

18
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:13,575
when the families have already,

19
00:01:13,608 --> 00:01:14,842
the families know each other

20
00:01:14,876 --> 00:01:18,846
and they feel that their kids
would be good for each other.

21
00:01:19,881 --> 00:01:21,583
A lot of Shaadi.com I think

22
00:01:21,616 --> 00:01:24,519
is profiles that are
done by their parents.

23
00:01:24,552 --> 00:01:27,722
In our case we each
wrote our own profile.

24
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:29,256
Although my parents were
definitely pushing me

25
00:01:29,289 --> 00:01:30,490
to get married at that point,

26
00:01:30,525 --> 00:01:33,193
and probably had a profile for
me that I don't know about.

27
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,896
[both laughing]

28
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:36,598
Once we went back to our hotel

29
00:01:36,631 --> 00:01:38,332
and my mom and dad asked me,

30
00:01:38,365 --> 00:01:40,668
"So is it a yes or no?"

31
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,637
And I was like,

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,672
"Just give me an hour
or two to think."

33
00:01:44,706 --> 00:01:46,741
And I took that hour

34
00:01:46,774 --> 00:01:49,711
and it just got, it
was a gut feeling that

35
00:01:49,744 --> 00:01:52,714
he seems to be a nice guy and
I'm going to give it a try.

36
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,385
It's not a bad idea to
know a person somewhat

37
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:03,658
before committing to a
lifelong life together.

38
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:13,635
[keyboard clacking]

39
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,278
[Ravi's Mom] Ravi
is a really good boy.

40
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:29,249
I have three sons and
Ravi is the best one.

41
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,251
I tell them that also.

42
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:32,419
Ravi is the youngest,

43
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:34,922
but he is the most
mature at heart.

44
00:02:34,956 --> 00:02:38,258
He loves cooking
with his mother.

45
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:40,595
Vegetarian is a must for us.

46
00:02:40,628 --> 00:02:42,664
Also no alcoholic.

47
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:47,635
He works as a researcher
with the local university.

48
00:02:47,669 --> 00:02:49,637
He likes his job so much

49
00:02:49,671 --> 00:02:53,240
that he has no
hobbies by choice.

50
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:55,409
Our family does not
believe in secrets

51
00:02:55,442 --> 00:02:58,913
so I will mention that Ravi
is genetically predisposed

52
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,916
to hypertension, asthma,
and he was fat as a child,

53
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,752
so diabetes is a concern.

54
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:07,254
If interested,
please message me.

55
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,799
[Rita's Mom] Rita
is a free spirit girl

56
00:03:17,832 --> 00:03:20,702
with strict moral values.

57
00:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,771
Her hobbies include caring
for her future in-laws

58
00:03:24,906 --> 00:03:27,608
and her ideal date is
cooking for her man

59
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:29,877
and watching a Bollywood movie.

60
00:03:30,845 --> 00:03:33,313
Rita is pescetarian by diet,

61
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:37,852
but she is willing to be fully
veg for the right family.

62
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:40,855
Please write us a message
so we can start chat

63
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,924
and marry our children.

64
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,792
US citizens only.

65
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,039
[Ravi] Is this okay
or is it too weird?

66
00:03:58,072 --> 00:03:59,607
[Rita] It's not too weird.

67
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,042
[Ravi] I want to
apologize again for...

68
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:03,578
[Rita] Oh, it's fine, really?

69
00:04:03,611 --> 00:04:05,479
[Ravi] It just looked so
different on Google Images.

70
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:06,748
[Rita] It's really fine.

71
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,449
[Ravi] It's just
on the website.

72
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,417
[Rita] A what?

73
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:12,053
[Ravi] It said it was
full of water and fish

74
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:13,353
on the website.

75
00:04:14,088 --> 00:04:14,956
[Rita] Oh.

76
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,492
You know, we're outside,

77
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,795
we could lower our
masks if you want.

78
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:32,006
I'm really glad this
timing worked out.

79
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,007
Me too.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,474
Usually on work trips,

81
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:35,643
my colleagues, they just like go

82
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,410
to a strip club or something

83
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:40,815
and I end up back in the hotel
just talking to my mother.

84
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:43,518
But I guess today you're my mom.

85
00:04:45,653 --> 00:04:46,521
Yes.

86
00:04:48,355 --> 00:04:50,323
I'm really sorry again about-

87
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,393
- Really, you don't
have to apologize.

88
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,897
I love empty reservoirs.

89
00:04:55,930 --> 00:05:00,935
[laughing] Wow,
you're so funny.

90
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,370
We have great banter.

91
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:05,305
Could you move back
a few more inches?

92
00:05:06,974 --> 00:05:08,475
Yeah.

93
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,409
A lot of ants.

94
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,645
Okay, thank you.

95
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:13,346
I usually don't sweat this much.

96
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:16,083
It's like we're in India.

97
00:05:16,117 --> 00:05:17,618
What?

98
00:05:17,652 --> 00:05:18,753
It's like we're in
India because it's so hot

99
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,321
and we're both brown,
and it's dirty.

100
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,592
This is probably
how our parents met.

101
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:26,027
You know, it's
kind of beautiful.

102
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:27,494
So what did you bring?

103
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,463
Oh, I couldn't get
everything I wanted.

104
00:05:31,599 --> 00:05:33,734
Oh, don't worry,
it is vegetarian.

105
00:05:33,768 --> 00:05:35,069
[Rita] Oh.

106
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:36,237
What?

107
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:39,040
Oh, it's just your mom
told me that you don't drink.

108
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:40,440
I don't.

109
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:43,978
Well, I think this
is hard lemonade.

110
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,713
There's alcohol in this?

111
00:05:45,746 --> 00:05:47,915
Yeah, five percent.

112
00:05:49,717 --> 00:05:51,484
I'm so sorry.

113
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:52,887
It's okay,

114
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,088
- you don't have to do that.
- The store was really busy

115
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:55,523
and I panicked and I
just, I love lemonade.

116
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:56,657
It was a mistake.

117
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:58,726
I swear on my
entire family's life,

118
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,460
I don't drink.

119
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,462
I don't drink either, so.

120
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,065
This must be very
distressing for you.

121
00:06:04,098 --> 00:06:05,566
It is, thank God.

122
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,968
Oh, oh no.

123
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:10,470
Oh, this is a little
bit of a mess.

124
00:06:10,504 --> 00:06:11,939
Oh, oh, no.

125
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,140
It's really wet.

126
00:06:16,677 --> 00:06:17,511
Oh God.

127
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:22,083
So how much longer do you
think all this will go on for?

128
00:06:22,116 --> 00:06:26,087
Oh, you probably shouldn't
touch your face with the gloves.

129
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,822
Oh.

130
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:30,591
[phone chiming]

131
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,667
Are you seeing this?

132
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:41,936
It went well.

133
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,071
[Ravi] Yeah, no mom,
I didn't drive here.

134
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,606
I took the train, remember?

135
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:47,975
[Rita] I don't know
Mom, it's just one date.

136
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:50,945
No, I think you should wait
to call her parents tomorrow.

137
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:52,513
I didn't check his hairline.

138
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:53,915
[Ravi] Yeah, the
train's canceled.

139
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,683
I'm actually just waiting
for the car rental agency

140
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:57,018
to call me back.

141
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,753
He seems loyal, yeah.

142
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:00,755
No, she didn't
bring up eating fish.

143
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:02,489
No, he doesn't seem gay.

144
00:07:02,523 --> 00:07:04,225
Yeah, no, Mom, we
didn't talk about Modi.

145
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,092
Okay.

146
00:07:05,126 --> 00:07:06,459
Talk to you later, bye.

147
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:07,662
Okay, I love you, mom.

148
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:08,529
Bye.

149
00:07:15,503 --> 00:07:17,505
I love your place.

150
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,471
[Rita] Oh, thanks.

151
00:07:18,506 --> 00:07:20,741
I didn't realize you
live with roommates.

152
00:07:20,775 --> 00:07:21,642
I don't.

153
00:07:23,244 --> 00:07:24,845
Right.

154
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:26,948
Oh, Rachel at the
car agency said

155
00:07:26,981 --> 00:07:28,582
she'd call me back.

156
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:29,449
When?

157
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:33,020
Oh, they didn't say when.

158
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,624
Should have asked that.

159
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:38,960
That's okay.

160
00:07:38,993 --> 00:07:41,829
You can just wait here
until they call back.

161
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,697
Thank you.

162
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,564
I'll pay you rent.

163
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,899
Oh, that's fine.

164
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,100
I'm joking.

165
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,034
I'm just gonna
go wash my hands.

166
00:07:47,068 --> 00:07:49,203
Yeah, no, yeah, go, of course.

167
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:57,845
Oh, God.

168
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,088
Ah, much better.

169
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:10,958
Oh, that's not mine.

170
00:08:10,992 --> 00:08:12,293
Oh, of course.

171
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:15,663
No, that's my landlord.

172
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:17,832
My landlord just comes
in here and drinks.

173
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:18,766
Oh.

174
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,201
Yeah, he really likes the TV

175
00:08:20,234 --> 00:08:22,169
so he watches the
game and drinks beer.

176
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,505
Where's the TV?

177
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,073
Are you hungry?

178
00:08:27,908 --> 00:08:29,643
Now that my career's
in such a good place,

179
00:08:29,677 --> 00:08:30,878
I'll get married this year,

180
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:32,246
have kids a year after that.

181
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,948
We'll all live with my mother.

182
00:08:33,981 --> 00:08:35,850
I'm actually closing
in on a house.

183
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:36,884
How many?

184
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:37,752
[Ravi] What?

185
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:38,619
Kids.

186
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,286
Three.

187
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,287
[Rita] Wow.

188
00:08:40,321 --> 00:08:42,089
Are you okay with three?

189
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:44,859
- Yes.
- I can also do two.

190
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:45,926
No, three is good.

191
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,094
Yeah, I prefer three.

192
00:08:48,329 --> 00:08:49,864
I just have to say

193
00:08:49,897 --> 00:08:52,767
it's so refreshing
to meet someone

194
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,169
with the same values,
you know, the same-

195
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,570
[phone buzzing]

196
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:57,838
Oh, I'm so sorry.

197
00:08:57,872 --> 00:08:59,974
It's the car rental.

198
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,977
Hi, hello?
[phone chiming]

199
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:03,878
Yes.

200
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:07,114
And that's the earliest?

201
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,317
Yeah, no, I'll take it.

202
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:12,920
Yeah, you can just charge
the card that's on the file.

203
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,990
All right, thank you so much.

204
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:16,891
Bye.

205
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,295
They said they don't
have anything available

206
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:24,899
until tomorrow morning.

207
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:27,701
So I think I can just look up

208
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:29,236
a hotel or something
really quick.

209
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,838
I think there's one
in this town, right?

210
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,941
Yes, the Sunset on Belmonte.

211
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,042
- Got it.
- Mhmm.

212
00:09:35,943 --> 00:09:36,811
Oh.

213
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,879
It's saying it's closed.

214
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,248
[Rita] What?

215
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:42,116
Yeah.

216
00:09:46,987 --> 00:09:48,722
I guess,

217
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,126
you could use my couch.

218
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,195
Oh my God, are you sure?

219
00:09:54,228 --> 00:09:56,730
That would be amazing.

220
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:57,731
Of course.

221
00:09:58,933 --> 00:10:00,868
Yeah, I have an extra
pillow, I think.

222
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,770
Okay, thank you so much.

223
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:03,904
No worries.

224
00:10:03,938 --> 00:10:05,106
I'll go call my parents

225
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:06,974
and let them know
you're staying over.

226
00:10:07,007 --> 00:10:07,975
[Ravi] Okay, I'll do the same.

227
00:10:08,008 --> 00:10:08,876
Okay.

228
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,954
Yeah, no, mom, I don't
really have any other choice.

229
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:22,823
Yeah, she's asking
her parents right now.

230
00:10:22,857 --> 00:10:24,992
No, mom, we won't hug tightly.

231
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,294
She's a very traditional girl.

232
00:10:27,328 --> 00:10:29,930
- Hi, Daddy.
- Okay, I love you too.

233
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:30,831
Bye.

234
00:10:33,801 --> 00:10:34,702
Yeah.

235
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,205
I've missed you like crazy.

236
00:10:42,877 --> 00:10:44,945
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

237
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:49,283
Daddy?

238
00:10:50,818 --> 00:10:52,086
I want your cock.

239
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,157
[lightly tense music]

240
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:01,195
No, Daddy, yes! [laughing]

241
00:11:20,981 --> 00:11:25,319
[sighing] This
can't be happening.

242
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:28,189
Oh.

243
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:47,942
[fingers tapping]

244
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,753
[Rita] Hey!

245
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,488
Hey, hey, hey!

246
00:12:01,523 --> 00:12:02,389
You okay?

247
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,792
Yeah, I'm great.

248
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:05,960
Are you okay?

249
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,895
Yeah, I just set up the couch.

250
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:10,297
My parents are comfortable
with you staying the night

251
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:11,932
as long as you sleep out here.

252
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,268
They're old fashioned, like me.

253
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:16,370
That's great.

254
00:12:16,403 --> 00:12:18,506
Okay, well, I'm going
to call it a night.

255
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,040
Okay, good night.

256
00:12:20,074 --> 00:12:21,809
[Rita] Good night.

257
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:28,282
[lightly tense percussive music]

258
00:12:34,556 --> 00:12:37,324
[birds chirping]

259
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:40,528
Hi, I was just
going to head out

260
00:12:40,562 --> 00:12:42,263
to the car rental place early.

261
00:12:42,296 --> 00:12:43,864
Oh, you sure?

262
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,399
Yes, I am very sure.

263
00:12:46,534 --> 00:12:48,235
Well, sorry I
don't have a car.

264
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:49,470
Otherwise I would've driven you.

265
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:50,437
Yeah it's okay,

266
00:12:50,471 --> 00:12:51,872
you've already said enough.

267
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:55,909
I mean, you've done
enough for me, so.

268
00:12:58,112 --> 00:12:59,280
Okay.

269
00:12:59,313 --> 00:13:02,283
Well I guess this
is goodbye then.

270
00:13:02,316 --> 00:13:03,217
Yes, bye.

271
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,822
Longest first date
ever. [chuckling]

272
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:09,490
It was.

273
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,060
Keep in touch.

274
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,161
[Ravi] No.

275
00:13:14,194 --> 00:13:15,429
What?

276
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,098
I meant yes, maybe.

277
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,100
Okay.

278
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:28,075
[sighing] For fuck's sake.

279
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,344
Ugh!

280
00:13:38,452 --> 00:13:39,320
Mm!

281
00:13:42,222 --> 00:13:43,090
Oh my god.

282
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,094
I missed you.

283
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:51,365
[door knocking]

284
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,868
I tried knocking.

285
00:13:54,902 --> 00:13:56,337
The car rental place called.

286
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,939
They said they won't have a
car for another three days.

287
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:04,978
There's no more rooms left
because of shelter in place.

288
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:06,614
You're not going
to tell her, right?

289
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:07,615
Who?

290
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:08,482
Your mom?

291
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:09,983
No.

292
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:11,619
I assume you tell
her everything.

293
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:14,088
I don't tell her everything.

294
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:14,988
I won't tell her.

295
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:20,528
Okay, because your
mom will tell my mom and

296
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:22,963
she pays for this place.

297
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,466
It's why I have to
go on these dates.

298
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:27,635
That's the deal.

299
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:32,039
Oh yeah, I won't talk.

300
00:14:32,072 --> 00:14:34,141
Okay, thank you, really.

301
00:14:35,209 --> 00:14:38,112
And you know, I'm sorry.

302
00:14:39,446 --> 00:14:41,448
I just, I do
think though, that,

303
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,952
I think you're not my wife.

304
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,154
Okay.

305
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:48,355
I mean this in a delicate way.

306
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,625
There was some deception
that's happened

307
00:14:50,658 --> 00:14:52,393
and it just feels wrong now.

308
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:53,528
Totally.

309
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:54,729
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

310
00:14:54,763 --> 00:14:57,665
I think we'll find someone
for ourselves that's better.

311
00:14:57,699 --> 00:14:59,066
I agree.

312
00:14:59,099 --> 00:15:00,000
Okay, I was a
little bit worried

313
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,503
that you were catching feelings.

314
00:15:01,536 --> 00:15:04,004
I think it's okay to move on.

315
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:04,905
Mhmm.

316
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:09,410
And were you
just, you were just,

317
00:15:09,443 --> 00:15:11,579
so you were just
pretending before?

318
00:15:11,613 --> 00:15:13,013
What do you mean?

319
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,048
It just, you said
you didn't eat meat,

320
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:16,483
and then, you know, I saw you.

321
00:15:17,451 --> 00:15:19,521
You're still eating chicken, so.

322
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:24,191
When did you start eating meat?

323
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,593
Oh, like few weeks ago.

324
00:15:25,627 --> 00:15:27,494
Oh, that's not that bad.

325
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:30,063
Well, I restarted after
I took a month off, so

326
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,200
in total, I think
since like high school.

327
00:15:35,637 --> 00:15:38,305
[Ravi] Thanks again
for letting me stay here.

328
00:15:38,338 --> 00:15:39,239
Of course.

329
00:15:39,273 --> 00:15:40,407
I'm not a monster.

330
00:15:40,441 --> 00:15:42,042
Yeah, I know, but I'm
a complete stranger.

331
00:15:42,075 --> 00:15:43,343
Well it's not the first time

332
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:45,179
I've let a stranger
stay with me.

333
00:15:45,212 --> 00:15:46,614
You mean?

334
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:47,981
Yeah.

335
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:49,551
You sounded different before.

336
00:15:49,584 --> 00:15:50,518
What do you mean?

337
00:15:50,552 --> 00:15:52,486
Oh, no, you just,
your voice just, yeah.

338
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,954
You sounded like Siri.

339
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:56,323
[Rita] Siri?

340
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,759
I just, I felt
like I could tell you

341
00:15:57,792 --> 00:15:59,226
anything without judgment.

342
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,730
You mean I
sounded subservient.

343
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:05,299
No, no, no.

344
00:16:05,332 --> 00:16:06,501
This is the real me.

345
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:09,203
Do you want me to be her?

346
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,271
No.

347
00:16:11,305 --> 00:16:13,373
Because I can,
if you need that.

348
00:16:16,744 --> 00:16:18,979
I do want to say that I,

349
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,684
I'm completely fine with
you drinking alcohol

350
00:16:22,717 --> 00:16:25,152
and eating dead animals,

351
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,722
and swearing if
you even do that.

352
00:16:27,755 --> 00:16:30,023
Yeah, fuck yeah, I do that.

353
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:31,291
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

354
00:16:31,325 --> 00:16:33,227
I'm not judgmental.

355
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,295
Well, that's very sweet,

356
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,397
but this is my house

357
00:16:37,431 --> 00:16:39,433
and I really don't
need your permission.

358
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:41,068
Wait, was I being sexist?

359
00:16:41,101 --> 00:16:41,736
Yes.

360
00:16:41,769 --> 00:16:43,103
I'm sorry.

361
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,539
I identify as a male feminist.

362
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:45,707
Oh, so a feminist?

363
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:50,110
I really liked the way
you decorated this place.

364
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,579
Oh, I didn't decorate it.

365
00:16:51,613 --> 00:16:53,615
Cybele did.

366
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:54,582
Who's Cybele?

367
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:58,586
She used to live
here and then she died.

368
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,220
Right where you're
standing, actually.

369
00:17:00,254 --> 00:17:01,355
What?

370
00:17:01,388 --> 00:17:02,524
[laughing] I'm just kidding.

371
00:17:02,557 --> 00:17:03,457
She lives a block away.

372
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,259
Ah, haha.

373
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,196
When I first saw this place,

374
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,199
I was like, whoa,
this is perfect.

375
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,334
I do not need to change a thing.

376
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:17,437
Yeah, it's a lot of horses.

377
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,172
You think?

378
00:17:19,206 --> 00:17:20,675
No, I mean, I like it.

379
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,276
Yeah, I like it.

380
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:24,746
I just, I feel like some
people might feel that way.

381
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:26,814
[Rita] Oh, well, I love them.

382
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,083
Yeah, did you grow
up around horses?

383
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:31,553
Never met one.

384
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,588
Just always been drawn to them.

385
00:17:33,621 --> 00:17:35,255
Why do you live here?

386
00:17:35,289 --> 00:17:36,624
[Rita] What do you mean?

387
00:17:36,658 --> 00:17:38,826
It just, it feels so
far away from everything.

388
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,763
Yeah, well, that's
why I live here.

389
00:17:41,796 --> 00:17:43,831
Yeah, but it must get lonely.

390
00:17:43,865 --> 00:17:47,334
I have this dream that I'm
going to grow old here and

391
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,536
become one of those women

392
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,705
like in a John Wayne
film or something,

393
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:54,842
like tanned and
leathery and hard.

394
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,746
Do you mind if I clean?

395
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,715
It really relaxes me.

396
00:18:00,748 --> 00:18:01,583
[Rita] Sure.

397
00:18:01,616 --> 00:18:02,449
Thank you.

398
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:06,754
1,324 cases last week.

399
00:18:07,655 --> 00:18:09,323
Gonna be 50,000 by March 28th.

400
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,359
Doubling time was seven days.

401
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,595
It's now three.

402
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,329
It's logarithmic, not linear.

403
00:18:15,362 --> 00:18:17,497
That's what everyone's missing.

404
00:18:17,532 --> 00:18:19,132
The death rates
aren't rising yet,

405
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,102
but they're a lagging indicator.

406
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:26,473
[light music]

407
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,816
Hey, did you realize
your fan was broken?

408
00:18:38,653 --> 00:18:41,221
[phone buzzing]

409
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,122
Oh.

410
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:44,826
Hi, ma.

411
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,226
[Vinny] Hey, Ma.

412
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,562
What are you doing at mom's?

413
00:18:47,595 --> 00:18:48,730
[Vinny] The world is
falling apart, little, bro.

414
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:50,197
Haven't you heard?

415
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,934
Are you quarantining
away from her?

416
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,334
[Vinny] Yeah, sometimes.

417
00:18:54,368 --> 00:18:55,536
Hold on, Asif wants
to say something.

418
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,170
[Asif] Yo, Ravi, put
our future sister-in-law

419
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:58,506
on the phone.

420
00:18:58,539 --> 00:18:59,774
- Yeah, no, that's-
- Yo. Put her on the phone!

421
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:00,775
That's really not
going to work out.

422
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:01,876
[Asif] Is she hot?

423
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:02,877
Uh huh?

424
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,478
[Asif] Just nod, you
don't have to say it.

425
00:19:04,512 --> 00:19:05,780
I know she's staring
at you right now.

426
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:07,515
Yeah she's here
for the meeting.

427
00:19:07,548 --> 00:19:08,850
[Vinny] Maybe now you
can actually get laid.

428
00:19:08,883 --> 00:19:10,585
[Asif] Ravi, laid?

429
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:11,886
[Ravi] What do we do now?

430
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,856
Do you mean for the next
few months or right now?

431
00:19:14,889 --> 00:19:15,757
[Ravi] Both.

432
00:19:17,558 --> 00:19:18,793
Try doing nothing.

433
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:20,460
Have you ever done that before?

434
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:23,865
What do you mean nothing?

435
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:25,533
I mean, nothing.

436
00:19:25,566 --> 00:19:26,834
Take it from someone
who's unemployed.

437
00:19:26,868 --> 00:19:28,736
The less you do,
the less you do.

438
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,540
The less you do, the
less you do. I like that.

439
00:19:32,573 --> 00:19:33,440
Yeah, I can do that.

440
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:35,342
Cool.

441
00:19:36,978 --> 00:19:37,845
Yeah.

442
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,881
What time is it?

443
00:19:39,914 --> 00:19:41,683
[Rita] 10:00 AM.

444
00:19:41,716 --> 00:19:42,850
10:00 AM-o.

445
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:48,355
[lips popping]

446
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,665
This is fun.

447
00:19:57,699 --> 00:19:59,667
It's very relaxing.

448
00:19:59,701 --> 00:20:01,468
[Ravi humming]

449
00:20:01,502 --> 00:20:03,805
What song am I thinking of?

450
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:06,206
I love doing
nothing in silence.

451
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,208
No, me too.

452
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,812
Yeah, this is really relaxing.

453
00:20:10,845 --> 00:20:11,846
Yeah, I have this friend

454
00:20:11,879 --> 00:20:13,648
he reads the books out loud.

455
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:16,851
And it's like, that's not
what that's meant for.

456
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,285
It's really crazy, you know.

457
00:20:18,318 --> 00:20:19,854
We're just like in this galaxy.

458
00:20:21,823 --> 00:20:24,559
[phone chiming]

459
00:20:28,863 --> 00:20:31,599
[Rita laughing]

460
00:20:39,006 --> 00:20:39,841
So.

461
00:20:41,075 --> 00:20:42,476
I was going to ask you,

462
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:45,345
have you been on a lot
of dates on Arranged?

463
00:20:45,378 --> 00:20:46,681
Oh yeah.

464
00:20:46,714 --> 00:20:48,649
Arranged, Shaadi, Vivah,
I'm on all of them.

465
00:20:48,683 --> 00:20:49,884
My mother is desperate.

466
00:20:49,917 --> 00:20:51,719
Wait, you're not?

467
00:20:51,753 --> 00:20:52,587
No.

468
00:20:53,521 --> 00:20:57,658
Do you want to be married?

469
00:20:57,692 --> 00:20:58,860
No, never.

470
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:00,494
You want to die alone?

471
00:21:00,528 --> 00:21:02,764
It's just someone else
to fight and disappoint

472
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:03,865
and hate and...

473
00:21:03,898 --> 00:21:06,000
No, it's just exhausting.

474
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,704
Why do you want to get married?

475
00:21:11,973 --> 00:21:14,909
It'd be nice to have
someone to cuddle with.

476
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:16,343
Yeah, well, you don't
need to be married

477
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,678
to cuddle someone.

478
00:21:17,712 --> 00:21:18,746
I literally do.

479
00:21:21,448 --> 00:21:22,683
I've been meaning to ask,

480
00:21:25,452 --> 00:21:26,821
how do I compare
to the other guys

481
00:21:26,854 --> 00:21:28,022
that you've gone on dates with?

482
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:31,859
Because I've just been trying
to do this for a year now.

483
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:34,862
And it just doesn't
seem to work out.

484
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,063
Right, I mean,

485
00:21:36,097 --> 00:21:38,699
well this way of meeting
someone is psychotic.

486
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:40,835
Well, my parents
spent seven days

487
00:21:40,868 --> 00:21:42,870
before they got married, so.

488
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,505
And how did that work out?

489
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,873
Am I boring?

490
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:46,741
What?

491
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:48,609
No.

492
00:21:48,643 --> 00:21:49,476
You hesitated.

493
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,343
[Rita] I did?

494
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,012
I'm not boring.

495
00:21:51,045 --> 00:21:51,946
I didn't say

496
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:52,914
- you were boring.
- Okay,

497
00:21:52,947 --> 00:21:54,549
you should see the people

498
00:21:54,582 --> 00:21:57,084
that work in my
research lab, okay.

499
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:58,686
There's this guy Vivek,

500
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:00,453
okay, he comes in every morning

501
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:02,089
and counts the
pennies in his wallet.

502
00:22:02,123 --> 00:22:05,726
And if the number isn't
even he'll skip lunch.

503
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:08,428
And then there's this girl Juhi.

504
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:13,400
Juhi insists on telling
you about every single bird

505
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,836
she saw on the way to work.

506
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:17,038
And I'm like, Juhi, I know
what a pigeon looks like.

507
00:22:17,071 --> 00:22:18,840
Wow, you're really
getting fired up right now.

508
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:21,709
You know, in college,
I was the fun one.

509
00:22:22,677 --> 00:22:23,511
Really?

510
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:24,879
Yes.

511
00:22:24,912 --> 00:22:27,748
People ask me all the
time to do impersonations.

512
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:32,419
Sonam, why don't you
make yourself useful

513
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:34,922
and go make some
chai for the guests!

514
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,595
Wait, was that supposed
to be a toxic uncle?

515
00:22:40,628 --> 00:22:41,494
Yes.

516
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,463
More.

517
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,765
Okay, okay.

518
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:50,771
Sonam, did you delete all the
Sex In The City from the DVR?!

519
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:55,176
[laughing] That's really good.

520
00:22:55,209 --> 00:22:57,111
Yeah, it's fun, I'm fun.
[phone chiming]

521
00:22:57,144 --> 00:23:01,749
Sonam, your hips don't lie.

522
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:02,917
I got to take this.

523
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:04,886
Some asshole stole my card.

524
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,554
Oh, yup no worries.

525
00:23:09,657 --> 00:23:10,958
Are you sure you can talk?

526
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,561
[Man On Phone]
Yeah, sure, it's fine.

527
00:23:14,929 --> 00:23:16,898
Are you two still fighting?

528
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,700
[Man On Phone] Actually, no.

529
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:20,935
So it's getting better?

530
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:24,171
[Man On Phone] I
just think, you know,

531
00:23:24,205 --> 00:23:26,040
with everything going on,

532
00:23:26,073 --> 00:23:27,842
we feel lucky or maybe that

533
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,409
we at least have each other.

534
00:23:32,113 --> 00:23:33,981
So do you want
me to stop calling?

535
00:23:34,015 --> 00:23:35,783
[Man On Phone] No, God, no.

536
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:36,851
That's not what I'm saying.

537
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:38,719
It's still a broken marriage.

538
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:40,554
I miss you.

539
00:23:41,656 --> 00:23:43,157
When can I see you again?

540
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,759
[Man On Phone]
Not for a while.

541
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:47,094
Of course.

542
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:54,702
Hey, where are you going?

543
00:23:54,735 --> 00:23:55,603
[Rita] Heading out.

544
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:56,469
You can't.

545
00:23:57,204 --> 00:23:58,039
What?

546
00:23:58,072 --> 00:23:59,040
It's shelter in place.

547
00:23:59,073 --> 00:24:00,608
We're allowed to go on walks.

548
00:24:00,641 --> 00:24:02,475
And I think given my
pre-existing condition,

549
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,544
that's not a good idea.

550
00:24:03,577 --> 00:24:04,545
What condition?

551
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:06,080
Oh, I told you I have asthma.

552
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:08,616
It sounded like you coughed
once when you were five.

553
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,551
I just, I think
we mutually decided

554
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,687
that it would be safer
if we just stayed in-

555
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,854
- Ugh!

556
00:24:13,888 --> 00:24:16,590
[kick banging]

557
00:24:20,027 --> 00:24:21,796
Nothing to fucking watch.

558
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:25,633
Oh, I don't watch
Hollywood stuff.

559
00:24:25,666 --> 00:24:26,801
I only watch Bollywood.

560
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,240
Hmm, what was that?

561
00:24:33,274 --> 00:24:34,208
What?

562
00:24:34,241 --> 00:24:36,510
Oh, I thought you asked why.

563
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:37,712
I didn't.

564
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:38,679
Yeah, our mom
was really worried

565
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:39,947
that if we watched too
much Hollywood stuff

566
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:41,115
we would become too white.

567
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,784
So it was all Bollywood
in our household.

568
00:24:43,818 --> 00:24:45,152
Not that I'm complaining.

569
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:46,587
Which ones have you seen?

570
00:24:47,955 --> 00:24:48,789
No.

571
00:24:48,823 --> 00:24:49,957
What do you mean no?

572
00:24:49,991 --> 00:24:51,759
- Just no.
- Oh, you mean Kal Ho Naa Ho?

573
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:52,727
No.

574
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,661
Oh, what a masterpiece.

575
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:55,196
Wait, you haven't seen it?

576
00:24:55,229 --> 00:24:57,131
Oh, you don't want
to sleep on this.

577
00:24:57,164 --> 00:24:58,866
Can I just tell you a
little bit about it quickly?

578
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:00,034
No.

579
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:01,736
Basically the movie
starts on char...

580
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:02,937
Actually no.

581
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,939
It's Preity, Preity is
running to New York.

582
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,008
And she's just, you know,
telling us about her life.

583
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:10,611
Like, her family's broken
and she's really depressed.

584
00:25:10,644 --> 00:25:12,213
And then you meet
her MBA classmate

585
00:25:12,246 --> 00:25:13,614
being played by Saif.

586
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:16,317
Honestly, it's one
of his best roles.

587
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:20,054
He is so stupid and lovable.

588
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:22,690
And then in walks Shah Rukh.

589
00:25:22,723 --> 00:25:25,760
And he's just like this angel.

590
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:29,030
[laughing] And like
these real funny things.

591
00:25:29,063 --> 00:25:30,031
And then right
before intermission,

592
00:25:30,064 --> 00:25:31,665
you find out that the
lady that you thought

593
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:32,600
was Shah Rukh's wife

594
00:25:32,633 --> 00:25:34,769
is actually his doctor.

595
00:25:34,802 --> 00:25:35,936
Yeah, he's dying.

596
00:25:37,104 --> 00:25:38,739
But then right before he dies,

597
00:25:38,773 --> 00:25:41,809
Priety finds out the
truth about them.

598
00:25:41,842 --> 00:25:44,612
And she runs to New York again.

599
00:25:44,645 --> 00:25:45,980
But this time she's crying.

600
00:25:46,947 --> 00:25:47,915
And she embraces Shah Rukh

601
00:25:47,948 --> 00:25:50,885
and she pieces together
all the beautiful things

602
00:25:50,918 --> 00:25:52,953
that he's done, all
his selfless actions.

603
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:57,058
And there's a stunning
speech in the end

604
00:25:57,091 --> 00:25:58,926
where they talk about
how you know you've met

605
00:25:58,959 --> 00:26:00,361
the one that you love

606
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,330
when you hear bells
ringing in your heart.

607
00:26:03,364 --> 00:26:06,967
Have you heard bells
when you catch feels?

608
00:26:09,103 --> 00:26:11,138
That's not what love is like.

609
00:26:13,107 --> 00:26:14,041
Oh yeah, I know.

610
00:26:15,943 --> 00:26:17,745
Yeah I know.

611
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:18,646
Oh!

612
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:25,986
If we go down this path,
there's no going back.

613
00:26:27,221 --> 00:26:28,089
Mhmm.

614
00:26:29,757 --> 00:26:31,192
Okay.

615
00:26:31,225 --> 00:26:33,260
Well, I'll show you
my underwear options.

616
00:26:35,096 --> 00:26:35,963
Right.

617
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:50,144
This isn't so bad.

618
00:26:51,445 --> 00:26:53,013
Yeah, I guess.

619
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:56,117
Yeah, I mean, we can do
this for two more days.

620
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,017
Sure.

621
00:26:58,152 --> 00:27:00,788
It's like, it
doesn't not work.

622
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:02,356
I guess.

623
00:27:10,998 --> 00:27:12,700
I'm feeling happy.

624
00:27:12,733 --> 00:27:13,868
Really?

625
00:27:13,901 --> 00:27:15,402
I just feel...

626
00:27:18,239 --> 00:27:19,106
[Rita] Whiskey?

627
00:27:21,442 --> 00:27:22,910
Oh, what?

628
00:27:23,944 --> 00:27:24,979
You feel whiskey.

629
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,015
Because I spiked your drink.

630
00:27:29,216 --> 00:27:32,753
[laughing] Are you joking?

631
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:33,622
No.

632
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:36,457
Why would you do that?

633
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,292
Because I'm bored.

634
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,860
And I thought it'd be funny.

635
00:27:40,961 --> 00:27:42,062
There's alcohol in...

636
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:47,434
Well.

637
00:27:48,903 --> 00:27:49,937
That's the shit.

638
00:27:54,041 --> 00:27:55,976
It's the shit, man.

639
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,444
You know what
else is the shit?

640
00:27:57,478 --> 00:27:58,846
[Rita] What?

641
00:27:58,879 --> 00:28:00,281
Research.

642
00:28:00,314 --> 00:28:01,882
[both laughing]

643
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,184
Research is the shit.

644
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:04,818
I agree.

645
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,187
You know what I love?

646
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,489
Chi statistical tests.

647
00:28:08,523 --> 00:28:10,791
Don't even get
me started on Chi.

648
00:28:10,824 --> 00:28:13,227
I'm so glad there's a

649
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:17,898
attractive female who I
can talk to about this.

650
00:28:17,932 --> 00:28:20,301
- Oh, I'm your girl.
- Get your friends dewy.

651
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:24,038
You know what's always
bugged me is like,

652
00:28:24,071 --> 00:28:27,474
why is the P value of 0.05

653
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,911
the threshold of certainty?

654
00:28:30,945 --> 00:28:32,479
Amen, I've always
thought this.

655
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:36,116
Don't eat that.

656
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,017
Ugh.

657
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:40,054
That's shit.

658
00:28:40,087 --> 00:28:41,355
Not the shit.

659
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:42,823
Mhmm.

660
00:28:42,856 --> 00:28:43,924
You know what
else is the shit?

661
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:44,825
[Rita] What?

662
00:28:46,827 --> 00:28:47,494
Standup.

663
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:50,297
Standup is the shit.

664
00:28:50,331 --> 00:28:51,966
I love stand up.

665
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:53,767
Have you ever done stand up?

666
00:28:54,536 --> 00:28:57,071
No. [laughing]

667
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:01,108
No! [laughing]

668
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:05,379
[Rita] I mean, you could
do stand up for me right now.

669
00:29:05,412 --> 00:29:09,116
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

670
00:29:09,149 --> 00:29:09,984
Mm-mm.

671
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:10,951
Okay, okay.

672
00:29:10,985 --> 00:29:11,986
- If you don't want to.
- I'm not going to do,

673
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:12,419
let's do stand up.

674
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,895
Hey guys, it's me, Ravi Sharma.

675
00:29:22,564 --> 00:29:24,932
Really excited.

676
00:29:24,965 --> 00:29:27,468
I've been dreaming about
this moment for a long time.

677
00:29:28,603 --> 00:29:31,238
Got the best fans in the
world, love you guys.

678
00:29:33,107 --> 00:29:37,845
I shit myself [laughing]

679
00:29:37,878 --> 00:29:40,347
before I got on stage,

680
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:41,782
So you're welcome.

681
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:46,153
What else?

682
00:29:47,622 --> 00:29:52,826
Oh, in high school they used
to call me chicken shwarma

683
00:29:55,062 --> 00:29:57,565
when it doesn't even make any
sense 'cause I don't eat meat.

684
00:29:57,599 --> 00:30:01,869
And it's Sharma, not shwarma.

685
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:12,212
Oh, don't worry,
this is diet Coke.

686
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:18,419
I'm the youngest
of three brothers,

687
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:21,322
but I'm closest to my mom.

688
00:30:21,355 --> 00:30:22,557
Oh my mom's
divorced, by the way.

689
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,058
Can I get a what what?

690
00:30:26,561 --> 00:30:29,330
Yeah, she's divorced
and divorce sucks, man.

691
00:30:29,363 --> 00:30:31,332
You know, it really sucks.

692
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:34,435
And it specially sucks
when you're Indian,

693
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:37,438
because you can't talk about it.

694
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:40,908
You can't talk about that.

695
00:30:42,476 --> 00:30:43,877
And you know, like you
go to functions and stuff

696
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:46,514
and they just pretend
like it didn't happen.

697
00:30:46,548 --> 00:30:48,248
You know what it's like,
it's like Game of Thrones.

698
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,117
You guys know Game
of Thrones, right?

699
00:30:51,452 --> 00:30:53,621
So like in Game of Thrones,
they killed Jon Snow.

700
00:30:53,655 --> 00:30:57,124
And then he just like
came back to life.

701
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,192
And it's like,

702
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:01,895
are we going to talk
about that, you know?

703
00:31:03,297 --> 00:31:04,164
Hmm.

704
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:06,433
Yeah, divorce sucks,

705
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:09,870
but you know what's even
worse than divorce is

706
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:12,607
being lonely.

707
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:16,076
Ugh, it feels so much worse.

708
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:20,381
Like, like I'd much rather
got married and then like try

709
00:31:20,414 --> 00:31:23,417
and try and try and try,
and then it not work out

710
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:26,086
than be lonely.

711
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:30,124
I mean, that's like the
real threshold of certainty.

712
00:31:30,157 --> 00:31:33,193
But you know, just
don't get divorced.

713
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,461
Don't be lonely.

714
00:31:36,564 --> 00:31:38,432
And there's fucking
shit everywhere.

715
00:31:43,437 --> 00:31:46,940
[upbeat Bollywood music]

716
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:53,180
Come on, let's dance.

717
00:31:53,213 --> 00:31:54,281
[Rita groaning]

718
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:55,650
Come on, come on.

719
00:31:57,217 --> 00:32:01,121
I've spent my whole life
not dancing, come on.

720
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:08,362
Okay.

721
00:32:14,602 --> 00:32:18,939
[dance song in foreign language]

722
00:33:54,502 --> 00:33:57,170
[Rita sighing]

723
00:34:07,481 --> 00:34:09,182
I said I'm sorry.

724
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:13,821
It's 323 dots yesterday.

725
00:34:13,855 --> 00:34:14,789
In this county.

726
00:34:15,823 --> 00:34:18,726
That's numbers rising,
just steadily rising.

727
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,762
You know, like I said,
it's logarithmic.

728
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:26,099
Everyone tries to drink
at least once in their life.

729
00:34:26,133 --> 00:34:27,467
What are you going
to do next, huh?

730
00:34:27,502 --> 00:34:30,538
You're going to put some
crystal meth in my ice tea,

731
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:33,708
some heroin in my mouthwash?

732
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,142
Oh, you're exhausting.

733
00:34:35,175 --> 00:34:36,578
[Ravi] My head really hurts.

734
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:47,187
[Instructor] What
is up, my loves?

735
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,657
We are here, we are ready,
we're going to shine.

736
00:34:49,691 --> 00:34:51,224
Today we are gonna
be using free weights

737
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:53,628
but if you don't have them,
you can use cans of soup

738
00:34:53,661 --> 00:34:54,762
or your cat, whatever.

739
00:34:54,796 --> 00:34:56,496
Okay, we're gonna
start with hand across.

740
00:34:56,531 --> 00:34:57,632
Okay.

741
00:34:57,665 --> 00:34:58,833
Here we go.

742
00:34:58,866 --> 00:35:01,468
Okay, breathe the music.

743
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:02,637
You got this, 60 seconds.

744
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:03,805
We can do anything
for 60 seconds.

745
00:35:03,838 --> 00:35:06,674
Oh my God, wait,
you are unstoppable.

746
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,475
Okay, these things are burning.

747
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:09,611
We burn for strength.

748
00:35:09,644 --> 00:35:12,479
Yes, feel the burn,
love the burn.

749
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:13,848
Okay, 15 seconds.

750
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:15,482
Go and drink in the
pop, don't be scared.

751
00:35:15,516 --> 00:35:19,621
Five, four, three, two, one.

752
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,221
Last, chest up.

753
00:35:21,254 --> 00:35:23,190
I want you guys to hinge
at the waist and push back.

754
00:35:23,223 --> 00:35:25,225
I want your titties to
just like hang free.

755
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,762
Whether you are an
A cup or a double G

756
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:29,631
your titties are powerful.

757
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,865
Love your body.

758
00:35:30,898 --> 00:35:33,367
Look at all you beautiful goals.

759
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,736
Squeeze your tush

760
00:35:34,769 --> 00:35:35,670
like the water keeps oozing.

761
00:35:35,703 --> 00:35:38,305
That's right, four, three, two,

762
00:35:39,206 --> 00:35:40,908
oh, make it burn.

763
00:35:40,942 --> 00:35:42,142
One, oh yes.

764
00:35:43,544 --> 00:35:44,912
As always you can
find me on Instagram,

765
00:35:44,946 --> 00:35:46,246
Twitter or my Tiktok.

766
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,750
See you until next time.

767
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:52,319
[both breathing heavily]

768
00:35:54,254 --> 00:35:55,590
Whoo.

769
00:35:55,623 --> 00:36:00,628
[Ravi groaning]
[phone buzzing]

770
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,700
What, you're not
going to answer that?

771
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:06,801
I don't want to.

772
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,703
But that's your mom.

773
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:14,509
[Rita's Mom] Why
didn't you answer before?

774
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,977
I was busy.

775
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:18,278
[Rita's Mom] I
called three times.

776
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:19,614
I'm sorry.

777
00:36:19,647 --> 00:36:22,449
[Rita's Mom] So busy
doing no job, getting older.

778
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:26,554
I haven't heard from
his parents yet.

779
00:36:26,587 --> 00:36:28,623
Must not have gone well.

780
00:36:28,656 --> 00:36:31,224
[Rita] Told you
it went well, mom.

781
00:36:31,258 --> 00:36:33,728
[Rita's Mom] I hope you
didn't show him the real you.

782
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:36,430
I didn't.

783
00:36:36,463 --> 00:36:38,966
[Rita's Mom] He
can't love that you.

784
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,568
You will thank me one day.

785
00:36:41,569 --> 00:36:42,603
[Rita] I know, Mom.

786
00:37:00,988 --> 00:37:02,355
You like pasta?

787
00:37:02,389 --> 00:37:04,357
I've been known to
eat a pound or two.

788
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,861
You want to help me cook?

789
00:37:06,894 --> 00:37:07,762
I can't.

790
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:09,731
I can teach you.

791
00:37:09,764 --> 00:37:11,766
My mother tried that already.

792
00:37:11,799 --> 00:37:12,900
Come on.

793
00:37:12,934 --> 00:37:14,602
I'm really bad at it.

794
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:15,970
Yeah, I don't believe that.

795
00:37:18,506 --> 00:37:19,372
Want me to try?

796
00:37:20,474 --> 00:37:21,341
Sure.

797
00:37:25,479 --> 00:37:27,882
[light music]

798
00:37:28,783 --> 00:37:29,717
It's a good start.

799
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:32,252
Stove's under here.

800
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,357
Do you know what
a stove looks like?

801
00:37:38,526 --> 00:37:40,728
Yeah, yeah that's a stove.

802
00:37:45,066 --> 00:37:45,933
Okay.

803
00:37:47,635 --> 00:37:49,670
Okay, we can work with this.

804
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,909
- [water splashing]
- Ooh.

805
00:37:58,378 --> 00:38:00,648
Hey, did you hear about
that guy in Argentina?

806
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:01,849
No.

807
00:38:01,883 --> 00:38:03,551
He set out on
a four month sail

808
00:38:03,584 --> 00:38:05,720
in December before COVID.

809
00:38:05,753 --> 00:38:08,956
No cell, no internet,
no way of reaching him.

810
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:11,324
He's just like an ocean cowboy.

811
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,895
You know, he's just floating out

812
00:38:13,928 --> 00:38:15,797
in the middle of the Atlantic,

813
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,965
has no idea that the
world has changed.

814
00:38:19,066 --> 00:38:21,368
He's the last innocent
man in the world.

815
00:38:21,401 --> 00:38:22,335
[Ravi] Sounds like a,

816
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,671
- Dream.
- Nightmare.

817
00:38:26,574 --> 00:38:27,508
That's good.

818
00:38:27,542 --> 00:38:28,810
[Rita] And now he's
going to be coming back

819
00:38:28,843 --> 00:38:29,977
to all of this.

820
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:35,448
It's like stepping
through a wormhole.

821
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:36,517
[Ravi] He'll adapt.

822
00:38:37,785 --> 00:38:38,653
Maybe.

823
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,658
With that one?

824
00:38:43,691 --> 00:38:45,458
- Yeah, that one.
- Okay.

825
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,133
So what do we do now?

826
00:38:52,166 --> 00:38:53,034
We just wait.

827
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:57,939
That was a lot of work.

828
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,707
Moment of truth.

829
00:39:03,845 --> 00:39:05,345
Oh my God, that is so good.

830
00:39:06,013 --> 00:39:07,648
Mmm.

831
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:08,950
- Mhmm.
- Right?

832
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:09,851
Mhmm.

833
00:39:10,918 --> 00:39:12,720
- No.
- You like it, right?

834
00:39:12,753 --> 00:39:15,323
Yeah, it's really
good, really good, mhmm.

835
00:39:16,157 --> 00:39:17,525
Wow.

836
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:19,426
This is amazing, fuck takeout.

837
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,028
I'm going to cook
every meal, I'm a chef.

838
00:39:21,062 --> 00:39:24,765
Mm, it's so filling I almost
feel like I'm already full.

839
00:39:24,799 --> 00:39:26,968
[both chuckling]

840
00:39:27,001 --> 00:39:27,869
Yes.

841
00:39:34,175 --> 00:39:36,577
Everything on here is trash.

842
00:39:36,611 --> 00:39:37,879
[Ravi] Mmm.

843
00:39:37,912 --> 00:39:39,547
I guess we have no choice.

844
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:41,716
What do you want
to watch tonight?

845
00:39:42,984 --> 00:39:45,485
Actually, I can double
check on my calendar,

846
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:49,422
but I'm pretty sure I'm booked
up tonight, unfortunately.

847
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:50,992
Oh, you...

848
00:39:51,025 --> 00:39:53,426
you've made plans or something?

849
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,095
Yeah.

850
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:56,864
[Rita] Okay.

851
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,034
I wouldn't do this
if you feel weird.

852
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,434
Why would I feel weird?

853
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:02,169
I don't know.

854
00:40:02,203 --> 00:40:03,137
[phone chiming]

855
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,171
What's your mom saying now?

856
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:05,673
Keep the train moving.

857
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,509
I'll coach you.

858
00:40:08,542 --> 00:40:10,211
Like Shah Rukh with Saif?

859
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:12,513
Sure, like that.

860
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:13,915
Oh, I can't go on a
date in front of you.

861
00:40:13,948 --> 00:40:15,549
Please, I'm so bored.

862
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,817
We have history.

863
00:40:16,851 --> 00:40:18,085
We met yesterday.

864
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,820
Can I have some
more concealer?

865
00:40:22,556 --> 00:40:24,491
I won't say anything,
I'll be off screen.

866
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:27,128
I'll just text
suggestions, okay?

867
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,235
[computer chiming]

868
00:40:34,268 --> 00:40:35,102
Hi!

869
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,804
Hi, Pallavi, it's Ravi.

870
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:38,906
Nice to e-meet you.

871
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:43,844
I'm good, and you?

872
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:46,247
[computer chiming]

873
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,848
Do an impersonation.

874
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:56,791
[laughing] Wow, that's a
really good Barack Obama.

875
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,094
I can actually do a
misogynistic Indian uncle.

876
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:03,831
Okay, you want to
see? [clears throat]

877
00:41:03,864 --> 00:41:05,032
Sonam?

878
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:07,068
Did you use all
the toilet paper?

879
00:41:07,101 --> 00:41:10,938
All the TP?! [laughing]

880
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,974
Wow, you have an amazing laugh.

881
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:16,143
I want three kids, is that okay?

882
00:41:18,012 --> 00:41:20,848
Yes, I would love to hear the
names you have picked out.

883
00:41:24,318 --> 00:41:26,020
Your smile is amazing.

884
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,760
I have to say you're-
[plates clattering]

885
00:41:35,129 --> 00:41:36,797
Uh huh, sorry, say that again?

886
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,735
Hey.

887
00:41:40,768 --> 00:41:42,870
Oh, she's super sweet.

888
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:44,238
She works in medicine,

889
00:41:44,271 --> 00:41:47,008
but she loves baking
and rose gardens.

890
00:41:47,041 --> 00:41:49,577
Wow, so fun.

891
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,244
[Ravi] Yeah.

892
00:41:50,277 --> 00:41:53,147
Is she traditional?

893
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,649
She really, really is.

894
00:41:55,683 --> 00:41:57,818
I brought up the kids,
she was totally on board.

895
00:41:57,852 --> 00:41:59,053
Brought up living with my mom,

896
00:41:59,086 --> 00:42:01,522
she said she would not
want it any other way.

897
00:42:02,857 --> 00:42:04,058
Yeah.

898
00:42:04,091 --> 00:42:07,161
She also said that she only
eats Western food on Sundays,

899
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:08,896
but she wants Indian
Monday through Saturday.

900
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:11,999
And I was like,
that is fine by me.

901
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,167
You know what I mean?

902
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,268
If I never eat a
veggie burger again,

903
00:42:14,301 --> 00:42:15,803
I'll be great.

904
00:42:15,836 --> 00:42:17,571
Wow, she sounds perfect.

905
00:42:17,605 --> 00:42:19,673
She, yeah, I don't, you know,

906
00:42:19,707 --> 00:42:20,875
I don't want to get
too ahead of myself,

907
00:42:20,908 --> 00:42:22,710
but I can definitely see
us getting to at least

908
00:42:22,743 --> 00:42:24,311
the engagement line.

909
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:27,681
And then, you know, we'll see.

910
00:42:27,715 --> 00:42:28,582
Are you okay?

911
00:42:29,683 --> 00:42:30,551
I'm great.

912
00:42:33,154 --> 00:42:35,656
[Ravi thumping]

913
00:42:35,689 --> 00:42:36,323
What are you doing?

914
00:42:36,357 --> 00:42:37,725
Oh, sorry.

915
00:42:37,758 --> 00:42:39,293
Whenever I feel a
rush of happiness

916
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:40,728
I get terrified
that the happiness

917
00:42:40,761 --> 00:42:41,896
will be taken away from me.

918
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:43,230
So just to distract myself.

919
00:42:53,107 --> 00:42:54,008
Do you paint?

920
00:42:55,843 --> 00:42:56,944
Yeah.

921
00:42:56,977 --> 00:42:59,080
[Ravi] Oh, wow, I had no idea.

922
00:42:59,113 --> 00:43:00,347
- Show me!
- No.

923
00:43:01,649 --> 00:43:02,316
Why?

924
00:43:03,651 --> 00:43:05,953
[Rita] It's not
your kind of thing.

925
00:43:05,986 --> 00:43:07,655
How do you know?

926
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:10,391
Because it's vaginas.

927
00:43:10,424 --> 00:43:14,095
Like not the nice kind,
like menacing vaginas.

928
00:43:14,128 --> 00:43:18,966
Blood gushing, barbed
wire, steel traps.

929
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:22,369
Just aggressive,
vaginal imagery.

930
00:43:22,403 --> 00:43:25,306
[tense percussive music]

931
00:43:25,339 --> 00:43:26,240
Do you like that?

932
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:28,609
Mhmm.

933
00:43:30,244 --> 00:43:33,013
[phone ringing]

934
00:43:33,047 --> 00:43:34,248
[Man On Phone] Rita?

935
00:43:34,281 --> 00:43:35,983
[Rita] Hey.

936
00:43:36,016 --> 00:43:38,719
[Man On Phone] It's
like two in the morning.

937
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:39,920
[Rita] I know.

938
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:41,956
[Man On Phone] You can't...

939
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,124
You can't just call.

940
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:44,291
[Rita] I know.

941
00:43:44,325 --> 00:43:46,327
[Man On Phone]
Did you text first?

942
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,695
No.

943
00:43:47,728 --> 00:43:48,662
[Man On Phone] Well,
that's the system.

944
00:43:48,696 --> 00:43:51,232
So please don't do that.

945
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:53,701
Okay, I'm sorry.

946
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:06,147
[light somber music]

947
00:44:17,191 --> 00:44:18,058
Rita?

948
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,327
I couldn't sleep.

949
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:27,201
So you put on a lehenga?

950
00:44:27,234 --> 00:44:28,903
Thought you'd like it.

951
00:44:28,936 --> 00:44:30,738
[Ravi] Have you
worn it before?

952
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,439
Patel uncle's
Holiday Inn opening.

953
00:44:33,474 --> 00:44:35,176
[Ravi] It's beautiful.

954
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:37,778
It's made by child labor.

955
00:44:37,811 --> 00:44:38,712
Is this a dream?

956
00:44:40,014 --> 00:44:42,016
It's your fantasy, Ravi.

957
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,284
[Ravi] You're being
so inappropriate.

958
00:44:43,317 --> 00:44:44,785
[Rita] I know.

959
00:44:47,154 --> 00:44:48,789
Can I make you some daal?

960
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:53,093
Daal makes me gassy.

961
00:44:57,398 --> 00:44:58,265
Did you fart?

962
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,503
[Ravi] Have we heard
back from Pallavi?

963
00:45:01,536 --> 00:45:03,103
[Ravi's Mom] No.

964
00:45:03,137 --> 00:45:05,072
[Ravi] Okay, do you want
to call her father tomorrow?

965
00:45:05,105 --> 00:45:06,473
[Ravi's Mom]
It's been 12 hours.

966
00:45:06,508 --> 00:45:08,142
Okay, thanks, mom.

967
00:45:08,175 --> 00:45:09,343
What about Serena
from last week?

968
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,444
[Ravi's Mom] Her
family is checking

969
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:11,812
with their astrologer.

970
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:13,480
Yeah, we should
follow up with them.

971
00:45:13,515 --> 00:45:15,049
[Ravi's Mom] Definitely.

972
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:16,217
Yeah you know, just
really stay on top of it.

973
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,384
I'll make a note.

974
00:45:17,418 --> 00:45:19,153
[Ravi's Mom] I'm
monitoring it closely.

975
00:45:19,186 --> 00:45:20,754
Yeah.

976
00:45:20,788 --> 00:45:22,089
I mean it's okay if it's a
pass, we just have to know.

977
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:24,225
[Ravi's Mom] What
about that other girl?

978
00:45:24,258 --> 00:45:25,859
What's her name, Tanu?

979
00:45:25,893 --> 00:45:28,162
[Ravi] Yeah no, Tanu was
the one with the lazy eye.

980
00:45:28,195 --> 00:45:30,431
[Ravi's Mom] Oh but she
has such a pretty mouth.

981
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,514
[phone ringing]

982
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:48,282
[Man On Phone] Okay, Rita,
I just told you not to call.

983
00:45:48,315 --> 00:45:50,050
- I'm coming over right now.
- [Man On Phone] What?

984
00:45:50,084 --> 00:45:51,986
- No, Beth is here.
- I know.

985
00:45:52,019 --> 00:45:52,987
[Man On Phone] Are you crazy?

986
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,188
I need to see you.

987
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:55,990
[Man On Phone] You can see
me when we're not in the middle

988
00:45:56,023 --> 00:45:58,425
of a pandemic and I'm not
quarantined with my wife.

989
00:45:58,459 --> 00:45:59,426
Why don't I talk to Beth?

990
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,095
[Man On Phone]
Are you serious?

991
00:46:05,466 --> 00:46:06,568
What are you doing?

992
00:46:06,601 --> 00:46:08,202
Oh, it's this
thing that's trending

993
00:46:08,235 --> 00:46:09,870
where everyone's making
noise at the same time

994
00:46:09,903 --> 00:46:12,239
to thank the healthcare workers.

995
00:46:12,273 --> 00:46:14,174
Aren't the doctors
in the hospital?

996
00:46:14,208 --> 00:46:15,543
Some of them are at home.

997
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,244
You think doctors live
in this neighborhood?

998
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:19,480
It's not just for doctors,
it's also for nurses.

999
00:46:19,514 --> 00:46:22,483
It's you know, really about
solidarity and connection.

1000
00:46:22,517 --> 00:46:24,251
We're banging pots and
pans for each other

1001
00:46:24,285 --> 00:46:25,986
to remind ourselves
that we're still here

1002
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,921
and that we can still
hear each other.

1003
00:46:29,023 --> 00:46:30,491
Should I start?

1004
00:46:30,525 --> 00:46:32,893
[pots clanging]

1005
00:46:32,926 --> 00:46:35,296
Thank you!

1006
00:46:35,329 --> 00:46:36,797
You're the real Avengers!

1007
00:46:37,898 --> 00:46:38,533
Rita?

1008
00:46:38,566 --> 00:46:39,900
I'll be back.

1009
00:46:39,933 --> 00:46:40,568
You're not even
wearing a mask.

1010
00:46:40,602 --> 00:46:41,435
I don't care.

1011
00:46:41,468 --> 00:46:42,403
People are dying.

1012
00:46:42,436 --> 00:46:43,337
I don't care.

1013
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,506
I don't care, I don't care!

1014
00:46:46,874 --> 00:46:48,175
It's our last day together.

1015
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:50,010
You can't control me.

1016
00:46:50,044 --> 00:46:50,978
[Ravi] I'm not
trying to control-

1017
00:46:51,011 --> 00:46:52,580
- You think you can
make everything happen

1018
00:46:52,614 --> 00:46:53,914
exactly the way you want it to

1019
00:46:53,947 --> 00:46:55,316
at exactly the time you want.

1020
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,017
Guess what?

1021
00:46:57,051 --> 00:46:58,085
You're not going to meet someone

1022
00:46:58,118 --> 00:46:59,320
seven days before your wedding,

1023
00:46:59,353 --> 00:47:01,121
hear a bunch of clanging
bells in your heart

1024
00:47:01,155 --> 00:47:02,189
and fall in love!

1025
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,292
Sometimes there
are no bells, Ravi.

1026
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:07,227
Sometimes it's just
deafening silence.

1027
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:13,967
[door slamming]

1028
00:47:22,443 --> 00:47:25,112
[somber music]

1029
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,866
[feet thumping]

1030
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:15,028
[door clacking]

1031
00:48:56,704 --> 00:48:58,338
Deja vu.

1032
00:48:58,372 --> 00:48:59,239
Yeah.

1033
00:49:04,077 --> 00:49:06,046
- Did you call to confirm?
- Yeah.

1034
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,347
I'm actually running late,

1035
00:49:07,381 --> 00:49:10,552
but I wanted to wait
for you to wake up so

1036
00:49:10,585 --> 00:49:13,621
I could say goodbye
before I left.

1037
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:15,088
Thanks.

1038
00:49:15,122 --> 00:49:15,989
Yeah.

1039
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:20,628
It was really nice getting to...

1040
00:49:23,531 --> 00:49:26,333
[pulse thumping]

1041
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:33,140
Ravi?

1042
00:49:33,173 --> 00:49:34,041
Yeah?

1043
00:49:36,210 --> 00:49:38,212
I'm really sorry
for what I said.

1044
00:49:38,245 --> 00:49:39,112
It's okay.

1045
00:49:41,181 --> 00:49:43,651
[gentle music]

1046
00:49:53,227 --> 00:49:56,129
[Rita coughing]

1047
00:49:56,163 --> 00:49:57,498
What was that?

1048
00:49:57,532 --> 00:49:58,633
Nothing.

1049
00:49:58,666 --> 00:49:59,801
- You just coughed.
- No I didn't.

1050
00:49:59,834 --> 00:50:01,168
No, I heard you.

1051
00:50:01,201 --> 00:50:02,336
No, I was just
clearing my throat.

1052
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:06,708
You just coughed.
[Rita coughing]

1053
00:50:06,741 --> 00:50:09,243
I don't have a temperature,
you've checked twice already.

1054
00:50:09,276 --> 00:50:11,245
Hi, yes, I'd like
to cancel my rental.

1055
00:50:11,278 --> 00:50:12,446
- Sir, there is
- Why would you

1056
00:50:12,479 --> 00:50:13,648
- cancel your rental?
- A cancellation fee.

1057
00:50:13,681 --> 00:50:15,517
No, yeah, I'll pay the fee.

1058
00:50:15,550 --> 00:50:16,618
Ravi, seriously.

1059
00:50:19,687 --> 00:50:20,822
I'll bring you all your meals,

1060
00:50:20,855 --> 00:50:22,790
but we can't be in
the same room anymore.

1061
00:50:22,824 --> 00:50:27,294
Well, I love being alone,
so that's fine. [sighing]

1062
00:50:28,495 --> 00:50:29,797
How are you going to get back?

1063
00:50:29,831 --> 00:50:31,666
[Ravi] I'm not
worried about that.

1064
00:50:33,768 --> 00:50:35,637
I don't need a nurse, Ravi.

1065
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:36,538
I know.

1066
00:50:48,415 --> 00:50:51,519
[light relaxed music]

1067
00:51:36,731 --> 00:51:37,865
Hey, Ravi?

1068
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:40,602
[Ravi] Yes?

1069
00:51:40,635 --> 00:51:43,470
[Rita] Could you get me
something from the bathroom?

1070
00:51:43,504 --> 00:51:44,471
Of course.

1071
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:45,339
[Rita] Great.

1072
00:51:49,844 --> 00:51:51,411
[Ravi] What do you need, Rita?

1073
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:55,449
So it's on the sink, it's
next to the moisturizer.

1074
00:51:56,383 --> 00:51:58,452
It's purple.

1075
00:51:59,386 --> 00:52:00,487
[Ravi] Purple.

1076
00:52:01,689 --> 00:52:06,193
[Rita] Yeah, and it's kind
of cylindrical and it vibrates.

1077
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:08,896
Jesus, Rita.

1078
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,666
[Rita laughing]

1079
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:17,437
[light guitar music]

1080
00:52:17,471 --> 00:52:19,373
[phone buzzing]

1081
00:52:19,406 --> 00:52:20,440
Hi, Ma.

1082
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:21,643
[Ravi's Mom] I'm sorry, betta.

1083
00:52:22,543 --> 00:52:23,945
She passed on me?

1084
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:25,780
[Ravi's Mom] Yes.

1085
00:52:25,813 --> 00:52:27,214
No worries.

1086
00:52:27,247 --> 00:52:28,181
[Ravi's Mom]
Betta, it's not you.

1087
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:30,551
Her mom said she is
focused on her career.

1088
00:52:30,585 --> 00:52:31,653
I'm getting a work call.

1089
00:52:31,686 --> 00:52:32,553
[Ravi's Mom] Betta.

1090
00:52:36,824 --> 00:52:38,358
[Rita] Well, fuck Pallavi.

1091
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:39,927
She was a loser anyway.

1092
00:52:39,961 --> 00:52:41,696
She went to Harvard
Medical School.

1093
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:43,865
No shit, get it Pallavi.

1094
00:52:43,898 --> 00:52:45,332
Yeah, you messed up, dude.

1095
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:54,374
[door knocking]

1096
00:52:54,408 --> 00:52:55,275
Who's there?

1097
00:52:55,308 --> 00:52:56,544
[Ravi] Spell.

1098
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:57,745
Spell who?

1099
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:59,714
[Ravi] W-H-O.

1100
00:52:59,747 --> 00:53:01,649
That was the worst one yet.

1101
00:53:01,683 --> 00:53:03,183
I can't do this anymore.

1102
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:07,287
[phone chiming]

1103
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,656
Is that you?

1104
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,457
Yeah, I had my hair
permanently straightened

1105
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:12,426
because everyone said
it looked like pubes.

1106
00:53:12,459 --> 00:53:13,828
Oh, I love your hair.

1107
00:53:13,861 --> 00:53:15,429
You do?

1108
00:53:15,462 --> 00:53:16,597
[door knocking]

1109
00:53:16,631 --> 00:53:18,298
No, they just
keep getting worse.

1110
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:19,366
I can't do this.

1111
00:53:19,399 --> 00:53:22,302
[door knocking]

1112
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:23,303
Who's there?

1113
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:24,204
[Ravi] Yeah.

1114
00:53:24,939 --> 00:53:26,273
Yeah who?

1115
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:27,875
[Ravi] No thanks,
I prefer Google.

1116
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:29,443
Oh, please stop.

1117
00:53:34,882 --> 00:53:35,717
[phone chiming]

1118
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,984
Just sent you one.

1119
00:53:37,018 --> 00:53:38,686
Is this prom?

1120
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:39,854
Yeah.

1121
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:42,557
That's me and Shane
Wright, my date.

1122
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:44,726
Best kiss I've ever had.

1123
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:49,463
When was your first kiss?

1124
00:53:49,496 --> 00:53:51,733
[Ravi] Rita, are
we really doing this?

1125
00:53:51,766 --> 00:53:52,834
Wait, have you?

1126
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:53,701
What?

1127
00:53:53,735 --> 00:53:54,602
Kissed someone.

1128
00:53:54,635 --> 00:53:55,803
Yes, yes!

1129
00:53:55,837 --> 00:53:57,004
I'm not that sheltered.

1130
00:53:57,038 --> 00:53:59,006
I kissed someone
in college, okay?

1131
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,208
Who?

1132
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:02,777
Rita, I'm not going to tell
you about Becky right now.

1133
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:03,678
[Rita] Becky?

1134
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:06,681
It was at a party.

1135
00:54:06,714 --> 00:54:08,683
I was walking up the stairs
to go to the bathroom

1136
00:54:08,716 --> 00:54:13,721
and she got in there, you know,
literally and into my mouth.

1137
00:54:15,056 --> 00:54:16,023
Whoa.

1138
00:54:17,825 --> 00:54:20,360
Anyways, then I shoved
my tongue back into her

1139
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:24,732
and I tried to do the same, you
know, hardness that she did.

1140
00:54:24,766 --> 00:54:25,967
And I think she liked it.

1141
00:54:26,868 --> 00:54:29,637
And yeah, we had touchdown.

1142
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:31,706
[Rita laughing]

1143
00:54:31,739 --> 00:54:34,474
[Rita coughing]

1144
00:54:40,081 --> 00:54:41,381
It's like siblings.

1145
00:54:41,414 --> 00:54:42,617
It's nothing like siblings.

1146
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,552
- Hold on.
- Do you fuck your siblings?

1147
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:47,522
You have to love your brother
regardless of who he is.

1148
00:54:47,555 --> 00:54:48,488
I don't have a brother.

1149
00:54:48,523 --> 00:54:50,457
Yeah but if you had
one, you'd love him.

1150
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,927
And if you arranged to a man,
you'd love him the same way,

1151
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,562
because you had to.

1152
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:56,063
It's a kick in the chest.

1153
00:54:56,097 --> 00:54:57,430
[Ravi] What do you mean?

1154
00:54:57,464 --> 00:54:58,599
Love.

1155
00:54:58,633 --> 00:55:00,768
It's not something
you grow like a plant.

1156
00:55:00,802 --> 00:55:02,670
You can't just go from
being complete strangers

1157
00:55:02,703 --> 00:55:04,005
to living together.

1158
00:55:04,038 --> 00:55:04,906
We did.

1159
00:55:06,841 --> 00:55:08,776
You sound short of breath.

1160
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:09,877
[Rita] You're being paranoid.

1161
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:10,878
Go eat some dinner.

1162
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:11,946
I'm not hungry.

1163
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:16,784
You know, I used
to be like you.

1164
00:55:17,919 --> 00:55:20,320
I didn't drink, I
didn't eat meat.

1165
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:22,623
Then you know what happened

1166
00:55:22,657 --> 00:55:24,926
when I started doing just
whatever I wanted to?

1167
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,728
What?

1168
00:55:27,762 --> 00:55:29,730
[Rita] I had better orgasms.

1169
00:55:31,699 --> 00:55:32,567
Rita.

1170
00:55:34,635 --> 00:55:36,137
[Rita] You're
uncomfortable because I said

1171
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,470
the word orgasm.

1172
00:55:39,907 --> 00:55:40,775
Ravi?

1173
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:44,444
Obviously you jack off.

1174
00:55:44,477 --> 00:55:46,881
I mean, you probably watch
all kinds of sick porn.

1175
00:55:47,815 --> 00:55:49,617
The door is closed.

1176
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:50,751
You can't see me.

1177
00:55:51,752 --> 00:55:54,822
Just say something real, please.

1178
00:55:58,759 --> 00:55:59,894
You're so repressed.

1179
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,097
It's like every morning
when you take a dump,

1180
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,966
you play music in the bathroom.

1181
00:56:04,999 --> 00:56:06,968
Like I'll never guess
what's going on.

1182
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:08,569
Should we talk about Daddy?

1183
00:56:09,804 --> 00:56:10,838
- What?
- Nevermind.

1184
00:56:14,609 --> 00:56:16,744
I don't know what you
think that you overheard.

1185
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:18,646
"I want your cock."

1186
00:56:22,149 --> 00:56:24,886
[Rita laughing]

1187
00:56:26,187 --> 00:56:27,788
Is he nice to you, Rita?

1188
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:30,791
Because you deserve that.

1189
00:56:37,531 --> 00:56:40,034
We met at a gallery.

1190
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:41,535
He knows a lot about art.

1191
00:56:45,806 --> 00:56:49,911
I started the
whole thing because

1192
00:56:49,944 --> 00:56:51,012
I wanted to,

1193
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,750
because it was impossible.

1194
00:56:59,587 --> 00:57:01,889
[Rita coughing]

1195
00:57:01,923 --> 00:57:03,157
[Ravi] What are you doing?

1196
00:57:04,859 --> 00:57:06,493
[Rita] Nothing.

1197
00:57:06,527 --> 00:57:09,163
[Ravi] Have you spoken to
your mom since you got sick?

1198
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:12,499
None of your business.

1199
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:15,069
[Ravi] Try to avoid avoidance.

1200
00:57:16,070 --> 00:57:17,705
I'm not avoiding anything.

1201
00:57:19,073 --> 00:57:20,708
[Ravi] You live in a museum.

1202
00:57:21,842 --> 00:57:23,210
No, I don't.

1203
00:57:23,244 --> 00:57:25,980
[Ravi] You should
make the first move,

1204
00:57:26,013 --> 00:57:28,716
then think about having
realistic expectation.

1205
00:57:30,952 --> 00:57:33,654
Why do you sound
like a self-help robot?

1206
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:36,090
[Ravi] I just want to
help you be happy like me.

1207
00:57:37,591 --> 00:57:38,960
Are you happy?

1208
00:57:38,993 --> 00:57:40,161
I'm very happy.

1209
00:57:40,194 --> 00:57:42,229
You're very lonely.

1210
00:57:42,263 --> 00:57:46,000
It's honestly a little pathetic
to need someone that much.

1211
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:50,705
What, you're allowed
to probe me endlessly,

1212
00:57:50,738 --> 00:57:53,007
but not vice versa?

1213
00:57:58,746 --> 00:57:59,981
Ravi?

1214
00:58:00,014 --> 00:58:00,881
[Ravi] Yeah?

1215
00:58:02,049 --> 00:58:03,851
Just checking
you're still there.

1216
00:58:04,752 --> 00:58:05,686
I'm still here.

1217
00:58:12,326 --> 00:58:14,595
[somber music]

1218
00:58:14,628 --> 00:58:16,130
[door creaking]

1219
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:18,899
[Rita coughing]

1220
00:58:33,881 --> 00:58:36,617
[Rita coughing]

1221
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:45,119
[gentle music]

1222
01:00:53,387 --> 01:00:54,221
Rita?

1223
01:00:56,190 --> 01:00:57,057
What?

1224
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,961
[Ravi] I think we have
to call an ambulance.

1225
01:01:03,297 --> 01:01:04,165
Rita.

1226
01:01:08,802 --> 01:01:10,237
What if I never come back?

1227
01:01:12,106 --> 01:01:12,973
Come on.

1228
01:01:14,175 --> 01:01:15,409
You're going to come back.

1229
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:23,851
[sirens wailing]

1230
01:01:35,095 --> 01:01:36,230
[phone ringing]

1231
01:01:36,263 --> 01:01:37,398
Rita?

1232
01:01:37,431 --> 01:01:38,966
[Rita] Ravi, it's
been 30 minutes.

1233
01:01:38,999 --> 01:01:40,434
Are they still admitting you?

1234
01:01:41,536 --> 01:01:43,103
[Rita] I'll call
you when I know more.

1235
01:01:43,137 --> 01:01:44,004
Bye.

1236
01:01:52,514 --> 01:01:55,282
[phone buzzing]

1237
01:01:55,316 --> 01:01:57,017
- Hello?
- [Dr. Henry] Hi there.

1238
01:01:57,051 --> 01:01:58,385
Is this Ravi Shwarma?

1239
01:01:58,419 --> 01:01:59,920
Yes.

1240
01:01:59,954 --> 01:02:01,855
[Dr. Henry] Am I
pronouncing that correctly?

1241
01:02:01,889 --> 01:02:03,224
Yes.

1242
01:02:03,257 --> 01:02:03,958
[Dr. Henry] Hi, I'm
calling from the hospital.

1243
01:02:03,991 --> 01:02:04,825
It's Dr. Henry.

1244
01:02:04,858 --> 01:02:05,926
Is this about Rita?

1245
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,961
[Dr. Henry] Yes.

1246
01:02:06,994 --> 01:02:08,162
Is she okay?

1247
01:02:08,195 --> 01:02:10,064
[Dr. Henry] So I
just need to verify

1248
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:11,865
that you are related to her.

1249
01:02:11,899 --> 01:02:13,000
Yeah, we're friends.

1250
01:02:14,134 --> 01:02:15,503
[Dr. Henry] Oh,
I can't disclose

1251
01:02:15,537 --> 01:02:16,904
private health information.

1252
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:18,506
We're dating,
we're going on dates.

1253
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:19,773
We live together.

1254
01:02:20,941 --> 01:02:22,309
[Dr. Henry] Oh, well she
didn't mention a boyfriend.

1255
01:02:22,343 --> 01:02:24,278
She gave you me my
number, didn't she?

1256
01:02:25,145 --> 01:02:26,247
[Dr. Henry] Yes.

1257
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,147
Is she okay?

1258
01:02:28,182 --> 01:02:29,250
[Dr. Henry] Stable.

1259
01:02:29,283 --> 01:02:31,118
We have her on oxygen.

1260
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:33,254
Okay, I have so
many questions.

1261
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:35,523
[Dr. Henry] Ooh,
okay, I gotta go.

1262
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:37,925
Sorry, it's my first
rapid response.

1263
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:39,960
What do you mean first?

1264
01:02:39,994 --> 01:02:41,195
[Dr. Henry] I'm new.

1265
01:02:41,228 --> 01:02:42,096
How new?

1266
01:02:43,264 --> 01:02:45,533
[Dr. Henry] Actually I started
the day before yesterday.

1267
01:02:45,567 --> 01:02:49,370
This has been a big week
for me, to say the least.

1268
01:02:49,403 --> 01:02:51,939
Just to be clear, you have
finished medical school, right?

1269
01:02:51,972 --> 01:02:52,873
[Dr. Henry] Oh God.

1270
01:02:52,906 --> 01:02:54,375
Yes, babe, of course.

1271
01:02:54,408 --> 01:02:55,976
When?

1272
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,545
[Dr. Henry] Actually
the day before yesterday.

1273
01:02:57,579 --> 01:02:58,412
Okay, bye.

1274
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:04,184
[phone ringing]

1275
01:03:12,359 --> 01:03:13,193
[Woman] Hello?

1276
01:03:13,227 --> 01:03:15,329
Hi, hi, this is Ravi.

1277
01:03:15,362 --> 01:03:18,032
I was told this was the
number to the room of Rita.

1278
01:03:18,065 --> 01:03:19,534
[Rita's Roommate] Oh,
this is her roommate.

1279
01:03:19,567 --> 01:03:20,801
Where's Rita?

1280
01:03:21,902 --> 01:03:24,004
[Rita's Roommate]
Taking a shit.

1281
01:03:24,038 --> 01:03:25,839
She looks good though, sweety.

1282
01:03:25,873 --> 01:03:28,175
Walking around, smiling.

1283
01:03:28,208 --> 01:03:30,177
Only two liters oxygen.

1284
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,912
Is that good?

1285
01:03:31,945 --> 01:03:33,314
[Rita's Roommate]
Better than me.

1286
01:03:33,347 --> 01:03:37,985
Could you please tell her
that Ravi Sharma called?

1287
01:03:38,018 --> 01:03:39,186
[Rita's Roommate] Mhmm.

1288
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:40,321
Thank you, do you need
me to spell that out?

1289
01:03:40,354 --> 01:03:42,189
[Rita's Roommate] No.

1290
01:03:42,222 --> 01:03:43,357
I think I got it.

1291
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:44,358
I think I can tell her.

1292
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:45,593
It's good, it's all good.

1293
01:04:11,285 --> 01:04:13,954
Oh, fuck.

1294
01:04:13,987 --> 01:04:15,255
Wow that's good.

1295
01:04:21,529 --> 01:04:22,996
Mm, that's good.

1296
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:25,366
Mm.

1297
01:04:27,602 --> 01:04:28,469
Ah!

1298
01:04:34,141 --> 01:04:35,142
Mmm, mm, mm!

1299
01:04:48,355 --> 01:04:49,356
Mmm!

1300
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,924
[fist banging]

1301
01:04:50,958 --> 01:04:54,562
[Ravi retching and coughing]

1302
01:05:51,251 --> 01:05:52,520
You're sick.

1303
01:05:52,554 --> 01:05:53,387
You're sick.

1304
01:05:58,091 --> 01:05:59,426
She's not even your wife.

1305
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:02,162
- Hi, Swati.
- Hi.

1306
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:03,464
Hi, I'm Ravi.

1307
01:06:03,497 --> 01:06:05,065
Nice to e-meet you.

1308
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,300
Ravi, yeah.

1309
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:08,570
I never know how to
start these things.

1310
01:06:08,603 --> 01:06:10,170
- Yeah.
- It's always so weird.

1311
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:12,039
Thank you for
making the time, yeah.

1312
01:06:12,072 --> 01:06:13,608
Oh yeah, sorry.

1313
01:06:13,641 --> 01:06:16,477
I've been really busy with,

1314
01:06:16,511 --> 01:06:18,780
you know, I work
at a law firm, so

1315
01:06:18,813 --> 01:06:20,648
- Right, right.
- It's always busy.

1316
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:22,015
- Right.
- Right.

1317
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:24,151
I'm also glad we
can finally do this.

1318
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:25,219
- Yeah.
- You know it's like

1319
01:06:25,252 --> 01:06:26,754
- hard to get a hold of.
- Yeah.

1320
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:28,322
Do you have any male friends?

1321
01:06:29,657 --> 01:06:30,625
What?

1322
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:32,493
I just asked if you
had any male friends,

1323
01:06:32,527 --> 01:06:36,096
like, do you have any
friends of the opposite sex?

1324
01:06:36,129 --> 01:06:39,099
Because I just, I have
this friend Rita and she,

1325
01:06:39,132 --> 01:06:41,736
Oh you want to know if
I know someone for Rita.

1326
01:06:41,769 --> 01:06:44,739
I don't off the top of my head.

1327
01:06:44,772 --> 01:06:46,039
No, it's just,

1328
01:06:47,140 --> 01:06:50,778
I just, it's just so infuriating
because she, you know,

1329
01:06:50,812 --> 01:06:54,047
I clean this apartment
like crazy, our apartment

1330
01:06:54,081 --> 01:06:56,618
and she just makes it dirty
right away, and it's like,

1331
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:58,252
Wait.

1332
01:06:58,285 --> 01:07:02,289
You live with Rita who's a girl?

1333
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:05,359
Yeah, well...

1334
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:07,829
I think the connection's
a little bit bad.

1335
01:07:07,862 --> 01:07:11,131
Why don't you tell me a
little bit about yourself?

1336
01:07:11,164 --> 01:07:12,366
Okay, well.

1337
01:07:12,399 --> 01:07:15,402
Well I'm not sure what
my mom told your mom,

1338
01:07:15,435 --> 01:07:19,473
but I am looking for something
just like more traditional.

1339
01:07:19,507 --> 01:07:24,512
Like not like an open thing
or something like that.

1340
01:07:25,312 --> 01:07:26,213
Oh yeah, me too.

1341
01:07:26,246 --> 01:07:28,348
I don't, you know, I mean,

1342
01:07:28,382 --> 01:07:29,617
if I get married
like at this point,

1343
01:07:29,651 --> 01:07:31,485
I'll be lucky if Rita's invited.

1344
01:07:31,519 --> 01:07:32,419
You know what I mean?

1345
01:07:32,452 --> 01:07:35,389
Oh, is she like your sister?

1346
01:07:35,422 --> 01:07:39,459
Oh no, oh no, no
she's not my sister.

1347
01:07:41,194 --> 01:07:43,096
That would not be good

1348
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:45,533
if she was my sister if
you know what I mean.

1349
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:47,367
No, you should
probably spell it out

1350
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:48,536
because I'm a lawyer.

1351
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,337
I need things spelled out.

1352
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:52,172
What are your feelings
on like, you know,

1353
01:07:52,205 --> 01:07:55,275
if two people of the
opposite sex that are Indian

1354
01:07:55,309 --> 01:07:57,244
have, you know, hugged a bunch

1355
01:07:57,277 --> 01:08:00,815
and maybe slept in a bed
together, but nothing else?

1356
01:08:00,848 --> 01:08:03,518
Is this about you?

1357
01:08:03,551 --> 01:08:06,486
No, I'm asking for a friend.

1358
01:08:06,521 --> 01:08:08,690
Is your friend Rita?

1359
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:11,559
Yeah, yeah.

1360
01:08:11,593 --> 01:08:13,327
I think she told me
that story, yeah.

1361
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:15,095
So she did that.

1362
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:17,097
What do you,

1363
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,333
do you think that's going to
work out with her and this guy?

1364
01:08:19,366 --> 01:08:21,234
Well, if I were her,

1365
01:08:21,268 --> 01:08:24,706
I would want you to tell
me how you feel directly.

1366
01:08:27,709 --> 01:08:30,177
Do you believe in a soulmate?

1367
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:31,278
I used to.

1368
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:32,714
Now it's kind of like,

1369
01:08:34,247 --> 01:08:37,184
you kind of have to deal
with what you get, you know?

1370
01:08:40,387 --> 01:08:43,123
[phone ringing]

1371
01:08:54,769 --> 01:08:55,603
Hello?

1372
01:08:55,637 --> 01:08:56,838
[Rita's Mom] Rita?

1373
01:08:56,871 --> 01:08:58,573
No.

1374
01:08:58,606 --> 01:08:59,907
[Rita's Mom] Who is this?

1375
01:08:59,941 --> 01:09:01,909
It's Rita's friend.

1376
01:09:01,943 --> 01:09:02,910
I've been calling her cell.

1377
01:09:02,944 --> 01:09:03,945
She doesn't answer.

1378
01:09:03,978 --> 01:09:05,847
I don't know what to do.

1379
01:09:05,880 --> 01:09:08,516
She's okay, she's
in the hospital.

1380
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:13,186
[Rita's Mom] What?

1381
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:16,924
She has COVID, auntie,

1382
01:09:16,958 --> 01:09:19,192
but she's only on
two liters of oxygen.

1383
01:09:19,226 --> 01:09:21,228
[Rita's Mom] Who
the hell are you?

1384
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,330
I'm Ravi.

1385
01:09:23,363 --> 01:09:24,832
We met recently.

1386
01:09:24,866 --> 01:09:27,234
She let me stay
over after my train-

1387
01:09:27,267 --> 01:09:28,569
- [Rita's Mom] Ravi Sharma?

1388
01:09:29,570 --> 01:09:30,538
Yes.

1389
01:09:30,571 --> 01:09:31,572
[Rita's Mom] What the
hell are you still doing

1390
01:09:31,606 --> 01:09:32,874
at my daughter's place?

1391
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,809
My car got delayed.

1392
01:09:34,842 --> 01:09:36,811
[Rita's Mom] I
need to talk to Rita.

1393
01:09:36,844 --> 01:09:39,212
I understand.

1394
01:09:39,246 --> 01:09:42,717
I can give you the number
for her room in the hospital,

1395
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,352
but I've been trying
and I can't get through.

1396
01:09:45,385 --> 01:09:46,988
[Rita's Mom] Is she okay?

1397
01:09:47,021 --> 01:09:48,188
Yes.

1398
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:50,758
[Rita's Mom] Is she okay?

1399
01:09:50,792 --> 01:09:52,359
Yes, yes, she's fine.

1400
01:09:52,392 --> 01:09:53,561
She's totally fine.

1401
01:09:53,594 --> 01:09:56,931
You know, she's so
strong and so young.

1402
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:01,803
[Rita's Mom] I
love her so much.

1403
01:10:01,836 --> 01:10:02,704
I know.

1404
01:10:09,309 --> 01:10:11,946
[phone buzzing]

1405
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:13,246
Rita, hi!

1406
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:14,448
- Hey!
- Hey.

1407
01:10:14,481 --> 01:10:16,751
Hey, I've been trying
to get through.

1408
01:10:16,784 --> 01:10:18,019
How are you?

1409
01:10:18,052 --> 01:10:19,687
I'm good.

1410
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:21,789
Okay, good.

1411
01:10:21,823 --> 01:10:23,390
Are you still only
on two liters?

1412
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:25,258
Yeah.

1413
01:10:27,294 --> 01:10:28,361
How's your roommate?

1414
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:33,901
[Rita] Not great.

1415
01:10:34,936 --> 01:10:35,803
What happened?

1416
01:10:37,672 --> 01:10:38,706
She's dead.

1417
01:10:40,742 --> 01:10:41,576
Rita.

1418
01:10:44,344 --> 01:10:46,914
It was so sudden.

1419
01:10:49,382 --> 01:10:52,019
She died looking at a
bunch of masked faces.

1420
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:54,454
Isn't that weird?

1421
01:10:58,726 --> 01:10:59,660
I miss you.

1422
01:11:00,928 --> 01:11:02,395
I miss you too.

1423
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:05,700
I barely know you.

1424
01:11:06,634 --> 01:11:07,502
Yeah.

1425
01:11:10,004 --> 01:11:10,838
I miss you.

1426
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:14,776
I miss you too.

1427
01:11:17,044 --> 01:11:19,714
[gentle music]

1428
01:11:27,822 --> 01:11:28,956
[Dr. Henry] Small
fever last night, but

1429
01:11:28,990 --> 01:11:32,059
her ferritin's down, d-dimers
down, pressure's stable

1430
01:11:32,093 --> 01:11:33,227
hovering around
two liters again.

1431
01:11:33,261 --> 01:11:36,697
It's an unpredictable
disease but she's doing well.

1432
01:11:36,731 --> 01:11:37,832
Okay, that's good.

1433
01:11:37,865 --> 01:11:39,934
[Dr. Henry] She cries
anytime anyone leaves the room.

1434
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:40,902
What?

1435
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:43,403
[Dr. Henry] She just
gets a little teary.

1436
01:11:43,436 --> 01:11:44,772
I went and sat
with her for a bit

1437
01:11:44,806 --> 01:11:47,474
and everyone keeps
telling me I only do that

1438
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:50,111
because I'm new. [chuckling]

1439
01:11:50,144 --> 01:11:52,013
Anyway, she eventually
told me to leave.

1440
01:11:52,046 --> 01:11:54,447
And when I did, she
started crying again.

1441
01:11:54,481 --> 01:11:56,050
He's a liar and a bitch.

1442
01:11:56,083 --> 01:11:57,752
He seems really nice.

1443
01:11:57,785 --> 01:12:00,621
He gets sweaty every
time he talks to me.

1444
01:12:00,655 --> 01:12:01,956
I think I make him nervous.

1445
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,591
[Ravi] Yeah, I can see that.

1446
01:12:04,725 --> 01:12:05,893
He's new.

1447
01:12:05,927 --> 01:12:06,794
Yeah.

1448
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:10,363
[Rita] I like him a lot.

1449
01:12:10,397 --> 01:12:11,833
Yeah, me too.

1450
01:12:11,866 --> 01:12:13,466
Number 17 is on the way.

1451
01:12:15,136 --> 01:12:18,706
Uh oh, number 14
is in the lead now.

1452
01:12:18,739 --> 01:12:20,575
[Rita's Mom] The
last time I brought

1453
01:12:20,608 --> 01:12:21,509
my famous malai kofta,

1454
01:12:21,542 --> 01:12:22,677
they didn't even touch it.

1455
01:12:22,710 --> 01:12:24,045
Well auntie, it
sounds like the ladies

1456
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:26,346
from your bridge club
are very judgmental.

1457
01:12:29,817 --> 01:12:30,818
My SAT score?

1458
01:12:32,553 --> 01:12:34,454
I think this was back, auntie,

1459
01:12:34,487 --> 01:12:36,891
when the test was out
of 1600. So it was 1450.

1460
01:12:38,025 --> 01:12:40,460
No, I know I could
have done better.

1461
01:12:40,493 --> 01:12:42,997
Oh, 14 is checking in on 17.

1462
01:12:44,966 --> 01:12:45,833
Let's see.

1463
01:12:47,568 --> 01:12:48,836
[Rita's Mom] Do
you know how to Zoom?

1464
01:12:48,870 --> 01:12:49,737
Zoom?

1465
01:12:51,172 --> 01:12:52,640
Yes, I've Zoomed, auntie.

1466
01:12:53,541 --> 01:12:54,407
I would like to Zoom.

1467
01:12:56,744 --> 01:12:59,013
Does your mother
make malai kofta?

1468
01:12:59,046 --> 01:12:59,981
Yes.

1469
01:13:00,014 --> 01:13:01,782
But mine will be much better.

1470
01:13:01,816 --> 01:13:03,751
So I want you to try it.

1471
01:13:03,784 --> 01:13:05,052
Oh yeah, I would love to.

1472
01:13:07,188 --> 01:13:10,057
[Dr. Henry] She made
good progress last night.

1473
01:13:10,091 --> 01:13:11,759
That's great.

1474
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:13,493
[Rita's Mom] Thank
you for updating me

1475
01:13:13,527 --> 01:13:14,996
since she won't call me.

1476
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:16,530
Of course.

1477
01:13:16,564 --> 01:13:17,798
She is very strong.

1478
01:13:18,666 --> 01:13:20,134
Yeah, I know.

1479
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:22,503
Why are you still there?

1480
01:13:22,536 --> 01:13:24,872
Don't you have a
life to get back to?

1481
01:13:26,974 --> 01:13:27,842
I don't know.

1482
01:13:29,977 --> 01:13:32,079
Thank you for staying.

1483
01:13:32,113 --> 01:13:33,915
[kettle whistling]

1484
01:13:33,948 --> 01:13:34,815
Of course.

1485
01:13:36,684 --> 01:13:39,186
[Rita] I have to
tell you something.

1486
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:40,121
That day?

1487
01:13:40,988 --> 01:13:41,856
Which day?

1488
01:13:42,823 --> 01:13:45,159
[Rita] I didn't go to Daddy.

1489
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:48,095
I just walked around and around.

1490
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:50,598
Oh.

1491
01:13:51,565 --> 01:13:53,768
But you were gone for
a long time though.

1492
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:58,706
[Rita] I laid down
in a park, fell asleep.

1493
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:04,111
And I went to the drug store
and touched everything.

1494
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:05,947
Everything.

1495
01:14:07,848 --> 01:14:09,482
Then I licked my fingers.

1496
01:14:10,251 --> 01:14:11,719
Rita, are you joking?

1497
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:13,921
[Rita] No.

1498
01:14:15,156 --> 01:14:16,857
Rita, why would you do that?

1499
01:14:18,592 --> 01:14:21,162
[Rita] There's nothing
worse than sitting at home,

1500
01:14:22,096 --> 01:14:24,632
like you're cornered and afraid.

1501
01:14:24,665 --> 01:14:29,670
Just sitting, afraid,
alone, afraid.

1502
01:14:31,806 --> 01:14:33,007
Alone.

1503
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:36,043
[equipment beeping]

1504
01:14:38,012 --> 01:14:40,881
- [thudding]
- Rita?

1505
01:14:43,651 --> 01:14:44,518
Rita?

1506
01:14:53,327 --> 01:14:55,830
Hi, hi, I need to be
transferred to nine west.

1507
01:14:59,233 --> 01:15:00,735
No, I need nine west.

1508
01:15:00,768 --> 01:15:02,870
I think they're transferred
me to the wrong place,

1509
01:15:02,903 --> 01:15:04,038
But she-

1510
01:15:04,071 --> 01:15:05,706
She's just going
to hang up on me?

1511
01:15:07,341 --> 01:15:11,012
Hi, hi, I need to be transferred
to nine west, it's urgent.

1512
01:15:11,045 --> 01:15:12,279
No, I need nine west,

1513
01:15:12,313 --> 01:15:14,515
they transferred me
to the wrong place.

1514
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:17,918
Shit!

1515
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:23,224
Nine west, the ninth
floor of the west ward.

1516
01:15:24,592 --> 01:15:26,027
Hello?

1517
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:28,529
[busy tone]

1518
01:15:30,064 --> 01:15:32,733
[somber music]

1519
01:15:33,667 --> 01:15:35,069
[Dr. Henry] She's sedated now.

1520
01:15:35,102 --> 01:15:36,737
After delirium, we see this.

1521
01:15:37,738 --> 01:15:38,906
What's delirium?

1522
01:15:39,974 --> 01:15:41,675
[Dr. Henry] A confused state.

1523
01:15:41,709 --> 01:15:44,211
Her brain is kind of disassociating
from pain and trauma.

1524
01:15:45,746 --> 01:15:47,815
- What's her prognosis?
- [Dr. Henry] I don't know.

1525
01:15:47,848 --> 01:15:50,751
She could wake up tomorrow
or in months, or...

1526
01:15:50,785 --> 01:15:52,620
Look, I can't take
away the uncertainty

1527
01:15:52,653 --> 01:15:53,954
and I wish I could.

1528
01:15:53,988 --> 01:15:55,756
I want to see her.

1529
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:56,857
[Dr. Henry] I know, Ravi.

1530
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:05,966
[Ravi] Hey, mom.

1531
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:08,069
[Ravi's Mom] Hi, betta.

1532
01:16:08,102 --> 01:16:09,637
[Ravi] Can I ask about dad?

1533
01:16:10,771 --> 01:16:12,773
[Ravi's Mom] Sure, sure.

1534
01:16:12,807 --> 01:16:14,975
What did you think
when you first saw him?

1535
01:16:17,378 --> 01:16:18,846
[Ravi's Mom] Honestly?

1536
01:16:18,879 --> 01:16:20,014
Yeah.

1537
01:16:20,047 --> 01:16:22,216
[Ravi's Mom] I
thought he was hot.

1538
01:16:22,249 --> 01:16:23,617
Really hot.

1539
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:25,219
Okay, I get it.

1540
01:16:25,252 --> 01:16:26,353
[Ravi's Mom] Big arms.

1541
01:16:26,387 --> 01:16:27,388
Big uh...

1542
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,123
Why didn't you make it work?

1543
01:16:31,125 --> 01:16:32,860
Didn't you feel so lucky?

1544
01:16:33,994 --> 01:16:35,930
You had a whole
life handed to you

1545
01:16:36,897 --> 01:16:37,798
on a platter.

1546
01:16:38,866 --> 01:16:40,968
[Ravi's Mom] Oh, betta.

1547
01:16:43,003 --> 01:16:46,240
We both are too
different, you know that.

1548
01:16:47,975 --> 01:16:52,980
The truth is ultimately
we all choose to love

1549
01:16:53,881 --> 01:16:55,382
or not to love.

1550
01:16:57,418 --> 01:17:01,355
Hey, I have a funny
news story for you.

1551
01:17:01,388 --> 01:17:04,191
A man in Argentina

1552
01:17:04,225 --> 01:17:07,695
was floating on a sailboat
before the pandemic.

1553
01:17:07,728 --> 01:17:08,863
I know that story.

1554
01:17:09,763 --> 01:17:11,398
The ocean cowboy.

1555
01:17:11,432 --> 01:17:13,267
[Ravi's Mom] Betta,
he just came back.

1556
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:16,036
He landed in Buenos
Aires yesterday

1557
01:17:17,171 --> 01:17:18,839
and now he knows.

1558
01:17:20,808 --> 01:17:22,343
He knows everything.

1559
01:17:25,179 --> 01:17:26,247
Imagine that.

1560
01:17:29,216 --> 01:17:32,286
[somber piano music]

1561
01:18:34,081 --> 01:18:37,351
[light uplifting music]

1562
01:18:50,898 --> 01:18:53,901
It's temporary, auntie,
that's what they say.

1563
01:18:53,934 --> 01:18:57,271
It's a kind of fog and
it's going to lift.

1564
01:19:24,465 --> 01:19:25,399
Are you serious?

1565
01:19:27,334 --> 01:19:28,202
What time?

1566
01:19:32,507 --> 01:19:34,008
No, I'll come pick her up.

1567
01:19:48,055 --> 01:19:49,156
[Rita] I want to walk.

1568
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:50,958
Are you sure you're
well enough to?

1569
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:52,393
[Rita] I swabbed negative.

1570
01:19:52,426 --> 01:19:53,561
Meet me at the park.

1571
01:19:53,595 --> 01:19:55,329
Rita, that's a
really long walk.

1572
01:19:56,397 --> 01:19:57,565
[Rita] We'll
stop if we have to,

1573
01:19:57,599 --> 01:19:59,066
we'll call a car if we have to,

1574
01:19:59,099 --> 01:20:00,134
but I want to walk.

1575
01:20:03,538 --> 01:20:05,339
Did you do the math?

1576
01:20:05,372 --> 01:20:06,840
What math?

1577
01:20:06,874 --> 01:20:08,309
[Rita] We met seven days ago.

1578
01:20:10,978 --> 01:20:12,446
I want to say something to you.

1579
01:20:14,915 --> 01:20:16,016
Say it in person.

1580
01:22:23,645 --> 01:22:26,380
[bells tolling]

1581
01:22:49,303 --> 01:22:52,105
[music swelling]

1582
01:23:05,385 --> 01:23:06,754
[light music]

1583
01:23:06,788 --> 01:23:10,257
Mala and I have been
married for 47 years now.

1584
01:23:12,192 --> 01:23:14,596
I think it's been
nearly 33 years now,

1585
01:23:15,663 --> 01:23:17,231
- since we've been.
- It'll be 33 this year

1586
01:23:17,264 --> 01:23:19,099
- yeah.
- 33 this year.

1587
01:23:20,602 --> 01:23:23,470
We've been married
for 15 years.

1588
01:23:25,272 --> 01:23:27,509
We've been married
for now what?

1589
01:23:27,542 --> 01:23:28,776
Almost nine years.

1590
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:29,744
Yeah, nine years.

1591
01:23:31,546 --> 01:23:35,115
I don't think soulmates
necessary exist.

1592
01:23:35,148 --> 01:23:36,316
I think they're created.

1593
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:41,355
She's the most
important person to me.

1594
01:23:41,388 --> 01:23:42,222
Oh?

1595
01:23:42,256 --> 01:23:43,357
Even after them.

1596
01:23:43,390 --> 01:23:44,659
What about me?

1597
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:47,562
What do we mean to each other?

1598
01:23:47,595 --> 01:23:49,363
We are very attached
to each other.

1599
01:23:49,396 --> 01:23:51,164
We are like best friends.

1600
01:23:52,867 --> 01:23:54,502
So we mean a lot to each other.

1601
01:23:57,337 --> 01:23:59,541
She's the number
one person in my life.

1602
01:23:59,574 --> 01:24:01,408
Has been like that always.

1603
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:03,410
Oh, where's my tissue?

1604
01:24:05,178 --> 01:24:06,848
A lot of conversations
and then meetings

1605
01:24:06,881 --> 01:24:09,116
and slowly we
started with getting,

1606
01:24:09,149 --> 01:24:11,586
we started getting
one of each other and

1607
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:13,588
we would just wait to
talk to each other.

1608
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:15,590
And I think in the process,

1609
01:24:15,623 --> 01:24:16,758
we didn't even come to know

1610
01:24:16,791 --> 01:24:19,493
when we fell in love
with each other.

1611
01:24:23,698 --> 01:24:28,101
[dance music in
foreign language]
