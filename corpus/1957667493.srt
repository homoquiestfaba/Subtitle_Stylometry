Put that down.

I don't know.

422
00:33:09,261 --> 00:33:10,128
It's one man.

Babe, I don't remember.

430

But they invested a lot
of time into making me who I am.

00:33:36,354 --> 00:33:37,848
A contract killer?

432
00:33:37,883 --> 00:33:39,421
I had no choice.

433
00:33:41,425 --> 00:33:42,292
But that's over.

No.

It's just a name.

That's a record.

571
00:52:25,416 --> 00:52:27,647
I've broken so many before you.

572
00:52:27,682 --> 00:52:31,354
You were the last
of this brave breed.

573
00:52:31,389 --> 00:52:33,290
The strongest, clearly.

574
00:52:36,724 --> 00:52:40,297
I have a schedule, Michael.

575
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:41,661
And I got all the time

576
00:52:41,696 --> 00:52:43,597
in the world, you piece of shit.

577
00:52:43,632 --> 00:52:46,303

I wonder how long she lasted...

...under the water.

579
00:52:47,966 --> 00:52:49,372
Go to hell.

The station is a few

Who were they?

590
00:54:31,542 --> 00:54:32,475
Be gone two days.

592
00:54:35,975 --> 00:54:37,073
Two days, that's all I need.

593
00:54:39,682 --> 00:54:42,012
You killed them.

594
00:54:42,047 --> 00:54:43,783
You killed all of them like,

595
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:45,422
like you had done that before.

596
00:54:47,591 --> 00:54:48,458
Have you?

597
00:54:58,899 --> 00:55:00,833
Don't use

You'll be safe.

601
00:55:10,647 --> 00:55:12,911
Tell me the truth...

602
00:55:12,946 --> 00:55:14,352
...or there is no us!

603
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:18,488
You can, you know.

604
00:55:20,118 --> 00:55:21,557
Just let me in.

605
00:55:24,859 --> 00:55:26,023
I'll tell you everything...

606
00:55:28,027 --> 00:55:28,894
...after.

607
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,472
This is happening any day now,

608
00:55:35,507 --> 00:55:37,672
and you can't
leave us like this.

609
00:55:37,707 --> 00:55:38,871
Please, what are you doing?

610
00:55:38,906 --> 00:55:40,136
You two are going,

611
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,071
and I'm gonna follow.

612
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:45,680
Take this.

613
00:55:45,715 --> 00:55:47,979

next to you... move.

614

to tell me who you are.

What I did...

621
00:56:14,612 --> 00:56:16,579
-Aha.
-...he's gone.

622
00:56:16,614 --> 00:56:18,174
I killed him a long time ago.

623
00:56:20,684 --> 00:56:23,586
Not supposed to exist anymore.

624
00:56:23,621 --> 00:56:25,753
Anywhere. You understand?

625
00:56:25,788 --> 00:56:27,117
I do.

626
00:56:27,152 --> 00:56:29,526
And so do you.

627
00:56:29,561 --> 00:56:30,791
And now so does he.

628
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:33,860
I have to find out
how they found me.

629
00:56:33,895 --> 00:56:36,060
They are gonna kill you.

630
00:56:39,868 --> 00:56:41,868

631
00:56:41,903 --> 00:56:42,770
Mm-hmm.

I have to make sure that...

633

...they never find us again.

634
00:56:49,548 --> 00:56:53,484

Had you done what I asked,
she would be alive.

751
01:09:40,285 --> 01:09:41,911
She knew nothing!

752
01:09:41,946 --> 01:09:44,012
[man in chair]
She knew your face,

753
01:09:44,047 --> 01:09:46,850
your body, your touch...

754
01:09:46,885 --> 01:09:48,918
...and she knew your real name.

755
01:09:50,790 --> 01:09:52,988
She was innocent.

756
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:56,431
[man in chair]
She was, until she met you.

757
01:09:56,466 --> 01:09:59,500
Every day, you killed her.

758
01:09:59,535 --> 01:10:02,635
Again, and again, and again.

759
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,538
-Shut up!
-And again,

760
01:10:04,573 --> 01:10:06,738
-and again.
-Shut up. Shut the fuck up!

761
01:10:06,773 --> 01:10:10,280
[panting]

762
01:10:10,315 --> 01:10:12,348
[man in chair]
Your rage is bleeding

763
01:10:12,383 --> 01:10:13,382
with truth.

764
01:10:15,782 --> 01:10:16,715
Don't you see?

765
01:10:18,851 --> 01:10:22,556
You failed her as you failed me.

766
01:10:22,591 --> 01:10:23,788
You betrayed us all.

767
01:10:31,864 --> 01:10:33,097
I did. I...

768
01:10:36,968 --> 01:10:37,868
I killed her.

769
01:10:39,740 --> 01:10:40,970
It was my fault.

770
01:10:41,005 --> 01:10:43,280
[somber music]

771
01:10:48,078 --> 01:10:49,550
[man in chair]
And all of these.

772
01:11:13,411 --> 01:11:16,346
I killed them.
[breathes heavily]

773
01:11:16,381 --> 01:11:17,578
I killed them all.

774
01:11:19,714 --> 01:11:21,043
[man in chair]
You are not a lover,

775
01:11:21,078 --> 01:11:22,748
nor a husband,

776
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:25,113
a father, or a son.

777
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:27,852
You are nothing to this world,

778
01:11:27,887 --> 01:11:30,525
but everything to me.

779
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:31,922
Why am I alive?

780
01:11:31,957 --> 01:11:33,495
[man in chair]
I needed you.

781
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:35,761
You were always
my favorite, Michael.

782
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:37,664
Don't you remember?

783
01:11:37,699 --> 01:11:39,732
I can show you
who you really are.

784
01:11:39,767 --> 01:11:41,129
Do I have a choice?

785
01:11:41,164 --> 01:11:42,702
[man in chair]
You can die tonight,

786
01:11:42,737 --> 01:11:44,033
a forgotten domino

787
01:11:44,068 --> 01:11:45,672
like the rest of the world,

788
01:11:45,707 --> 01:11:47,377
or I can let you live.

789
01:11:47,412 --> 01:11:48,939
I wanna live.

790
01:11:48,974 --> 01:11:50,842
Please.

791
01:11:50,877 --> 01:11:52,107
Please, I do.

792
01:11:54,716 --> 01:11:55,880
[man in chair]
In my shadow?

793
01:11:57,950 --> 01:11:58,817
Working for me?

794
01:12:01,052 --> 01:12:02,920
Yes.

795
01:12:02,955 --> 01:12:04,361
[man in chair]
Your blind loyalty?

796
01:12:05,991 --> 01:12:06,858
Yes.

797
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,499
[man in chair]
I can't hear you, Michael.

798
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,767
Yes.

799
01:12:14,802 --> 01:12:16,131
[man in chair]
Your forgiveness?

800
01:12:23,074 --> 01:12:25,613
You have it.

801
01:12:25,648 --> 01:12:28,484
[man in chair]
You see,
you are a killer, Michael.

802
01:12:28,519 --> 01:12:30,981
An animal born in a cage.

803
01:12:31,016 --> 01:12:32,686
And your freedom

804
01:12:32,721 --> 01:12:33,885
is this final target.

805
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:37,988
Someday you will thank me

806
01:12:38,023 --> 01:12:40,056
for this gift of anonymity.

807
01:12:40,091 --> 01:12:41,827
[airplane engine rumbling]

808
01:12:46,636 --> 01:12:48,702
[eerie music]

809
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:16,763
Can I help you?

810
01:13:25,873 --> 01:13:28,137
Where we going?

811
01:13:28,172 --> 01:13:29,039
Not far.

812
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:35,045
Tonight?

813
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:35,980
No flight plan.

814
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:53,162
No flight plan?

815
01:13:55,034 --> 01:13:57,199
[laughing]

816
01:13:57,234 --> 01:13:59,267
[eerie music]

817
01:13:59,302 --> 01:14:01,544
[faint and overlapping voices]

818
01:14:51,860 --> 01:14:53,926
[helicopter blades whirring]

819
01:15:13,651 --> 01:15:15,717
[cell phone buzzing]

820
01:15:20,856 --> 01:15:22,757
Hey, you. You there?

821
01:15:22,792 --> 01:15:25,287
[Abigail]
<i>Yeah. Can you hear me?</i>

822
01:15:25,322 --> 01:15:26,761
You there?

823
01:15:26,796 --> 01:15:28,862
<i>We're safe.</i>

824
01:15:28,897 --> 01:15:31,062
<i>Do what you have to</i>
<i>do to come back to me.</i>

825
01:15:31,097 --> 01:15:31,964
I will.

826
01:15:34,771 --> 01:15:35,737
<i>Are you there?</i>

827
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:36,606
I'll be home soon.

828
01:16:05,901 --> 01:16:08,165
Here?

829
01:16:08,200 --> 01:16:11,773
Next field is here,
a hundred meters east.

830
01:16:11,808 --> 01:16:12,675
Copy that.

831
01:16:14,679 --> 01:16:15,612
What's down there?

832
01:16:17,209 --> 01:16:19,814
I need 20 minutes.

833
01:16:19,849 --> 01:16:21,376
At 30...

834
01:16:21,411 --> 01:16:24,181
...I leave you.

835
01:16:24,216 --> 01:16:25,149
I'll be dead, anyway.

836
01:16:28,858 --> 01:16:30,924
[cell phone buzzing]

837
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,066
[dark music]

838
01:17:56,407 --> 01:17:58,473
[dark music continues]

839
01:18:09,794 --> 01:18:12,025
[camera clicks]

840
01:18:12,060 --> 01:18:12,927
Look at me.

841
01:19:02,011 --> 01:19:04,814
[silencer shooting]

842
01:19:14,155 --> 01:19:16,221
[dark music intensifies]

843
01:19:36,573 --> 01:19:37,814
My son.

844
01:19:40,918 --> 01:19:43,314
You've changed.

845
01:19:43,349 --> 01:19:45,855
A man knows
when he is growing old

846
01:19:45,890 --> 01:19:48,957
when he looks like his father.

847
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:53,291
I knew you'd find me again.

848
01:19:53,326 --> 01:19:55,161
It was worth it...

849
01:19:55,196 --> 01:19:57,328
...waiting for you.

850
01:19:57,363 --> 01:19:58,428
After all this time...

851
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:02,630
...why did you come for me?

852
01:20:02,665 --> 01:20:05,567
Because I'm selfish...

853
01:20:05,602 --> 01:20:07,635
...and weak.

854
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:09,571
I had to see you.

855
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:15,082
I betrayed you, Michael.

856
01:20:15,117 --> 01:20:17,018
Yesterday.

857
01:20:17,053 --> 01:20:18,151
Years ago.

858
01:20:23,356 --> 01:20:25,994
Who did this to you?

859
01:20:26,029 --> 01:20:29,998
They exiled me,
Michael, from my work.

860
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,033
I'm a banished king,

861
01:20:32,068 --> 01:20:35,234
protected every second.

862
01:20:35,269 --> 01:20:37,533
Even from myself.

863
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,341
We agreed.

864
01:20:45,246 --> 01:20:46,949
We agreed...

865
01:20:46,984 --> 01:20:48,313
...to end this

866
01:20:48,348 --> 01:20:49,952
when I paid my debt.

867
01:20:49,987 --> 01:20:53,120
It should have ended with you,

868
01:20:53,155 --> 01:20:54,550
the first one.

869
01:20:57,027 --> 01:21:00,457
The only one
that mattered to me.

870
01:21:00,492 --> 01:21:03,262
You promised me.

871
01:21:03,297 --> 01:21:05,198
You promised me my freedom.

872
01:21:05,233 --> 01:21:07,233
No, no, my boy,

873
01:21:07,268 --> 01:21:10,005
I promised you anonymity

874
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:12,700
to make you stronger.

875
01:21:12,735 --> 01:21:14,537
And, look,

876
01:21:14,572 --> 01:21:17,573
you're alive.

877
01:21:17,608 --> 01:21:20,642
I turned you into something

878
01:21:20,677 --> 01:21:23,381
I never intended.

879
01:21:23,416 --> 01:21:25,988
From a man...

880
01:21:26,023 --> 01:21:28,089
...into...

881
01:21:28,124 --> 01:21:29,618
...an animal.

882
01:21:29,653 --> 01:21:32,456
Oh, it was my mistake

883
01:21:32,491 --> 01:21:36,295
to pretend to be God.

884
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,627
I don't care.

885
01:21:38,662 --> 01:21:40,365
You were the only one

886
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,664
who knew who I was.

887
01:21:42,699 --> 01:21:48,175
You still don't
understand who you are.

888
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,440
Who am I?

889
01:21:49,475 --> 01:21:53,048
You came into the world alone.

890
01:21:53,083 --> 01:21:55,215
I took you away.

891
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,383
What I did I had to do.

892
01:21:58,418 --> 01:22:02,354
For the work, I needed you...

893
01:22:02,389 --> 01:22:03,685
...to be.

894
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:05,324
What is you talking about?

895
01:22:07,625 --> 01:22:12,562
I am not the father you deserve.

896
01:22:12,597 --> 01:22:15,103
I made you...

897
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:18,568
...but I am not him.

898
01:22:18,603 --> 01:22:22,440
But I was your only family.

899
01:22:22,475 --> 01:22:25,014
Not anymore.

900
01:22:25,049 --> 01:22:27,181
What are you saying?

901
01:22:27,216 --> 01:22:28,644
I have a family of my own.

902
01:22:30,483 --> 01:22:32,021
Impossible.

903
01:22:34,091 --> 01:22:37,455
I am not the animal
you think I am.

904
01:22:37,490 --> 01:22:40,425
A wife?

905
01:22:40,460 --> 01:22:42,328
Tell me her name.

906
01:22:44,101 --> 01:22:44,759
Abigail.

907
01:22:47,335 --> 01:22:48,664
Abigail...

908
01:22:50,602 --> 01:22:54,505
...like the raging wind.

909
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:57,541
We can end this together.

910
01:22:57,576 --> 01:22:59,180
What do I need to do?

911
01:22:59,215 --> 01:23:01,413
Step out of the shadows

912
01:23:01,448 --> 01:23:03,415
you have worked so hard

913
01:23:03,450 --> 01:23:05,549
to shroud yourself within.

914
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:07,452
You run.

915
01:23:07,487 --> 01:23:10,257
Stay alive.

916
01:23:10,292 --> 01:23:12,325
There is nothing there

917
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:15,163
-for you.
-Help me.

918
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:17,528
Help me, damn you.

919
01:23:17,563 --> 01:23:19,827
In your beginning...

920
01:23:19,862 --> 01:23:23,534
...is your end, Michael.

921
01:23:23,569 --> 01:23:28,143
No man remembers...

922
01:23:28,178 --> 01:23:30,079
...the day he was born,

923
01:23:30,114 --> 01:23:33,346
but his father does.

924
01:23:33,381 --> 01:23:35,678
You were born...

925
01:23:35,713 --> 01:23:38,450
...October 3rd...

926
01:23:38,485 --> 01:23:42,124
...1973.

927
01:23:43,787 --> 01:23:45,523
Where?

928
01:23:45,558 --> 01:23:47,261
Where I took you

929
01:23:47,296 --> 01:23:50,495
so many years ago...

930
01:23:50,530 --> 01:23:53,234
...before you
were taken from me.

931
01:23:55,238 --> 01:23:57,667
Seek yourself...

932
01:23:57,702 --> 01:23:59,372
...in the darkness.

933
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:06,742
Who am I?

934
01:24:09,516 --> 01:24:12,352
I tried to love you.

935
01:24:15,192 --> 01:24:18,127
Forgive me, my boy.

936
01:24:23,200 --> 01:24:25,497
Once more...

937
01:24:25,532 --> 01:24:26,795
...unto the bridge...

938
01:24:29,239 --> 01:24:31,536
...and after...

939
01:24:31,571 --> 01:24:33,835
