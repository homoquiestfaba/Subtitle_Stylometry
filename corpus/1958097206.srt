But, you know, you don't
have to worry about money.

180
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:28,929
I can go to my parents and,
y'know, they'll help you out.

181
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:29,937
Stacy, I understand.

182
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,426
But everybody ain't got
the luxury of rich parents.

183
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:33,996
[Stacy] But Juice-

Okay, Juice, okay, Juice.

00:14:51,921 --> 00:14:52,966
Just not that great.

360
00:14:53,008 --> 00:14:54,071
He'll see.

361
00:14:54,113 --> 00:14:56,860
(ball bouncing)

362
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:58,552
In the one.

363
00:14:58,594 --> 00:14:59,531
(scoffing)

364
00:14:59,573 --> 00:15:00,724
He ain't got nothing, man.

365
00:15:00,766 --> 00:15:01,849
Miss, miss.

366
00:15:03,053 --> 00:15:03,963

368
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:08,394
(chuckling)

369
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:09,520

370
00:15:09,562 --> 00:15:11,550

371
00:15:11,592 --> 00:15:12,932

372
00:15:12,974 --> 00:15:14,641

373
00:15:14,683 --> 00:15:17,178

374
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,466

375
00:15:19,508 --> 00:15:20,508

376
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:21,590

00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:28,458
You can't miss a shot.

380
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,291
- You never miss.
- Man, that shot

381
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,124

I'd still have my 1,500.

388
00:15:38,101 --> 00:15:39,139

390
00:15:41,522 --> 00:15:42,772

393
00:15:48,466 --> 00:15:51,133
(hip hop music)

394
00:15:52,462 --> 00:15:53,628
You know what?

00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:03,121
Man, your uncle, man,

427
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,813

430
00:17:11,232 --> 00:17:14,334
Man, if it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't be walking anyway.

431
00:17:14,376 --> 00:17:16,459
(tsking)

432
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,321
(door closing)

433
00:17:22,363 --> 00:17:23,154
'Sup, son?

434
00:17:23,196 --> 00:17:26,114
Can't keep your face

439
00:17:34,751 --> 00:17:36,816
All right, sounds good.

440
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:39,775
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, just-

441
00:17:40,856 --> 00:17:42,360
- All right, look, you know I'm out here

442
00:17:42,384 --> 00:17:44,249
trying to stay out that eye.

443
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:47,492
'Cause, y'know, people trying
to watch what's going on.

444
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:48,612
- Yeah.
- You know,

445
00:17:48,654 --> 00:17:50,300
I always feel like somebody watching me,

446
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:51,509
y'know what I'm talking about?

447
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:53,448
That's why you gotta
keep your eyes open, baby.

448
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:54,330
That's it.

449
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,600
Hey, remember that trip I told
you I was gonna take you on?

450
00:17:56,624 --> 00:17:58,350
Oh, you wanna talk about the past?

451
00:17:58,392 --> 00:18:00,251
Yeah, yeah, it's gonna happen,

452
00:18:00,293 --> 00:18:01,220
know what I'm saying?

453
00:18:01,262 --> 00:18:02,770
Just a little while longer.

454
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:04,829
We might have to take that
trip a little bit early.

455
00:18:04,853 --> 00:18:06,231
- Why?
- 'Cause,

456
00:18:06,273 --> 00:18:08,761
word on the street is,
Capone came home, and

457
00:18:08,803 --> 00:18:10,464
- I don't feel safe.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,

458
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:11,910
back up, back up.

459
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:12,891
Who came home?

460
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:15,170
Word on the street is, Capone came home.

461
00:18:15,212 --> 00:18:16,381
(groaning)
- Wait, wait, wait,

462
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:17,196
whoa, whoa,

463
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:19,688
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

464
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,675
How you find that out?

465
00:18:20,717 --> 00:18:22,864
Listen baby, I was at
the grocery store today,

466
00:18:22,906 --> 00:18:25,824
and I ran into a few people that know him.

467
00:18:25,866 --> 00:18:29,014
And word on the street is, yeah, he's home.

468
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:34,056
Like I haven't seen him, but
you know, the town is small.

469
00:18:34,134 --> 00:18:35,723
You heard this today?

470
00:18:35,765 --> 00:18:37,463
I heard this today.

471
00:18:37,505 --> 00:18:40,293
All right, all right, look.

472
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:43,363
This is my town, all right?

473
00:18:43,405 --> 00:18:45,288
I think we should just pack up and go.

474
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,355
Like, we talk about taking trips and stuff.

475
00:18:47,397 --> 00:18:49,433
Yes we do, but... And it's time.

476
00:18:49,475 --> 00:18:51,166
But, look... Gotta get away.

477
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,125
All the operations is right here.

478
00:18:55,326 --> 00:18:58,373
We up and move right now, you
know what that's gonna do?

479
00:18:58,415 --> 00:19:00,332
You know what it's gonna
do to our credibility?

480
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,184
You know what it's gonna do to the supply?

481
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:04,331
We can't just up and move like that.

482
00:19:04,373 --> 00:19:05,664
I mean, there's levels to this.

483
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:08,212
We gotta make a plan, execute that.

484
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:09,913
Just like we doing this, right here.

485
00:19:09,955 --> 00:19:12,653
We gotta do something.

486
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:15,645
Look, we gonna do something,
don't worry about it.

487
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:17,329
I'll get some folks on them,

488
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:19,092
to kinda keep 'em at bay for a minute,

489
00:19:19,134 --> 00:19:22,475
until we can get stuff
situated, we can leave.

490
00:19:22,517 --> 00:19:23,610
All right, but look,

491
00:19:23,652 --> 00:19:25,443
like I said, don't worry about it.

492
00:19:25,485 --> 00:19:27,526
Ghost already took care of you, right?

493
00:19:27,568 --> 00:19:31,555
You still alive, you still
breathing, healthy, looking good.

494
00:19:31,597 --> 00:19:33,794
All right, don't worry about
it, I gotcha, all right?

495
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:34,959
- I know.
- Hey son, come here

496
00:19:34,983 --> 00:19:36,066
for a minute.

497
00:19:37,983 --> 00:19:38,983
Yes?

498
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:44,174
Last week, you told Daddy that you want

499
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,641
- that new 2K, right?
- Yeah.

500
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,351
All right, you've been
doing good in school.

501
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,561
I'm proud of you.

502
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:50,703
All right, look.

503
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:55,270
Hey, go get it, and whatever
else you want, all right?

504
00:19:55,312 --> 00:19:57,023
- Okay.
- All right, I love you.

505
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,565
- I love you, too.
- All right.

506
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:05,381
But like I said, we're gonna be all right.

507
00:20:05,423 --> 00:20:07,707
All right, this is only temporary.

508
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:11,614
After that, we opening up businesses.

509
00:20:11,656 --> 00:20:13,869
Remember that hair salon you wanted?

510
00:20:13,911 --> 00:20:14,702
Yes.

511
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:15,843
I ain't forgot about it.

512
00:20:15,885 --> 00:20:18,229
You're gonna have that, all right?

513
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:22,863
Whatever it is that my
baby wants, she gonna get.

514
00:20:22,905 --> 00:20:25,891
'Cause you been there for
me, when I ain't had nothin'.

515
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,230
All right, you've been there in the trench-

516
00:20:27,254 --> 00:20:28,413
You ain't never left me.

517
00:20:28,455 --> 00:20:29,592
From the mud, baby.

518
00:20:29,634 --> 00:20:31,782
So I got you, all right.

519
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:35,663
Ain't no Capone, nobody gonna take you out.

520
00:20:35,705 --> 00:20:38,163
All right, as long as Ghost is here,

521
00:20:38,205 --> 00:20:39,581
- you feel me?
- All right, Ghost.

522
00:20:39,623 --> 00:20:41,379
All right, so, like I
said, don't worry about it.

523
00:20:41,403 --> 00:20:43,843
I'm gonna get this, all right.

524
00:20:43,885 --> 00:20:47,133
I might have some goons on it, y'know?

525
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:49,460
And don't worry about who.

526
00:20:49,502 --> 00:20:51,062
All right, don't worry about who,

527
00:20:51,104 --> 00:20:54,653
the less you know about
that, the better, okay?

528
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:55,986
Like I said-

529
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:59,833
So where you trying to go?
(knocking at door)

530
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:00,666
Who is it?

531
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:01,958
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, son.

532
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,791
Don't do that.

533
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:03,908
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

534
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:06,108
Damn, babe, you be rushing to the door.

535
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:09,057
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

536
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:10,189
I know who that is, man,

537
00:21:10,231 --> 00:21:12,064
you can open the door.

538
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,528
Hey, what's going on?

539
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:17,498
All right.

540
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,499
What's going on, man?

541
00:21:18,541 --> 00:21:20,606
What's goin' on, guy, what's goin' on?

542
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:22,205
(mumbling)

543
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:23,544
Good to see you, good to see you.

544
00:21:23,568 --> 00:21:25,095
Good to see you too, bruh.

545
00:21:25,137 --> 00:21:26,074
What you want?

546
00:21:26,116 --> 00:21:27,602
I know why you're here, what you want?

547
00:21:27,626 --> 00:21:29,183
Sit down, have a seat.

548
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,025
All right, time for you
to get up outta here,

549
00:21:31,063 --> 00:21:31,874
'cause I'd hate to put down

550
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,276
a senior citizen in these streets-

551
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:34,097
- All right, man.

552
00:21:34,139 --> 00:21:36,217

553
00:21:36,259 --> 00:21:37,594

554
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,635
You know where my money at, man.

555
00:21:39,677 --> 00:21:41,043
Capone, I don't know
where your money is, bro.

556
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:41,858
What you talking about?

557
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,460
You the only motherfucker

558
00:21:43,484 --> 00:21:44,526

559
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:46,644
Somebody else know

560
00:21:46,686 --> 00:21:48,216
Stop fuckin' playing with me man.

561
00:21:48,258 --> 00:21:49,864
Look, I'm ya man, a hundred grand, bro.

00:21:50,907 --> 00:21:52,010
- You my man, a hundred grand?
- [Ghost] Yeah.

564
00:21:52,034 --> 00:21:53,535
(punching) (grunting)

565
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:56,235

566
00:21:56,277 --> 00:21:57,652
Where my motherfuckin' money at, man?

567
00:21:57,676 --> 00:21:59,596
It's the last time I ask you.

568
00:21:59,638 --> 00:22:01,722
Is that my shit on the fuckin'
table, right there, man?

569
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:03,162
Take it, take it.

570
00:22:03,204 --> 00:22:05,099
Get the fuck over there, man.

571
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:08,977
Get over there before I blow

572
00:22:09,019 --> 00:22:09,810
(murmuring)

573
00:22:09,852 --> 00:22:11,896
Move out the way, get

574
00:22:11,938 --> 00:22:14,816
It's alright, babe, just let him take it.

575
00:22:14,858 --> 00:22:17,055
I'm not fuckin' playing.

576
00:22:17,097 --> 00:22:18,915
(cash rustling)

577
00:22:18,957 --> 00:22:20,775
You stole my motherfuckin' stash.

578
00:22:20,817 --> 00:22:23,046
Why I'm locked the fuck up, nigga.

579
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:25,352
Don't play with me.

580
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:26,920

00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:28,543

587
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:41,645

00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,847
Get your little ass over there, man.

00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:46,217
How you gonna do me like that, nigga?

591
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,657

592
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:49,957
Hey, man, look.

00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:52,543

00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:55,977
- Man, shut the fuck up, man, stop whining.

596
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:57,575
All right, all right.

597
00:22:57,617 --> 00:22:59,215
Gimme this god damn money, man.

601
00:23:04,296 --> 00:23:05,456
Fuck's wrong with you, man?

602
00:23:05,487 --> 00:23:06,525

603
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:08,003

00:23:14,098 --> 00:23:17,061
I should bust a cap in your

607
00:23:17,103 --> 00:23:17,894
Huh?

608
00:23:17,936 --> 00:23:19,055
I shoulda killed you, man.

609
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,165
We went to high school
together and everything-

610
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:23,623
- That's right man, we did
go to high school together.

611
00:23:23,665 --> 00:23:24,860
What you doing this for, man?

612
00:23:24,902 --> 00:23:26,035

00:23:28,977 --> 00:23:31,457
I never did, nigga, you know me.

616
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:33,114
You gon' act brand new.

617
00:23:33,156 --> 00:23:34,721
It's all right, man,

618
00:23:34,745 --> 00:23:36,376
You got it, you got it, all right?

00:23:38,602 --> 00:23:41,435

00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:42,751

628
00:23:56,324 --> 00:23:59,241
(moody trap music)

629
00:24:09,496 --> 00:24:13,329
(moody trap music continuing)

630
00:24:26,844 --> 00:24:29,353
Yeah, man, you know

631
00:24:29,395 --> 00:24:30,642

See, you lucky you ain't

00:24:39,582 --> 00:24:41,880
You ain't get all that

00:24:41,922 --> 00:24:43,981
Man, how the fuck you

00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:45,180

00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,493
How the fuck you get out, man?

640
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,482
I kept quiet.

641
00:24:49,524 --> 00:24:51,422
You know me, I don't say
a motherfuckin' thing.

642
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:52,892
Y'all niggas know me by now.

00:24:52,934 --> 00:24:54,491
Y'all know what I do.

644
00:24:54,533 --> 00:24:55,728
I don't say nothing, I don't talk.

645
00:24:55,752 --> 00:24:57,680
Long as you don't say
nothing, they don't know shit.

646
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,965
They'll put everything against you,

647
00:24:58,989 --> 00:25:00,430
like they know every god damn thing.

648
00:25:00,472 --> 00:25:03,704
They don't know a motherfuckin' thing.

649
00:25:03,746 --> 00:25:05,141
Well, I know who told on your ass.

650
00:25:05,165 --> 00:25:08,113
I told you, like I'm thinking
with my head, I'm viewing-

651
00:25:08,155 --> 00:25:10,603
That nigga, T-Bo, told on your ass.

652
00:25:10,645 --> 00:25:11,903
Yeah-He told on me?

653
00:25:11,945 --> 00:25:14,165
He know who the fuck I am? I'm Capone.

654
00:25:14,207 --> 00:25:15,653
He ain't care about you.

655
00:25:15,695 --> 00:25:18,579
Lemme tell you, T-Bo, he ain't shit, man.

656
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:19,781
This nigga!

657

You know where he live at?

He live on Rose apartments... He know.

662
00:25:28,905 --> 00:25:30,244
Apartment nine?

663
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:32,584
Nine, man, Rosewood, bruh.

664
00:25:32,626 --> 00:25:33,538
He ain't lie to you man.

665
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,843
If you gonna handle
something, I don't know nothin'.

666
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:38,421
- I don't play that shit, man.
- Kill bro.

667
00:25:38,463 --> 00:25:41,018
Now that nigga about to
meet his motherfuckin' maker.

668
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:43,477
(indistinct)

669
00:25:45,289 --> 00:25:47,918
It's 12 o' clock,
this boy still sleeping.

670
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,619
Hey, Juice, get up, come on, now.

671
00:25:50,661 --> 00:25:52,536
Come on, it's 12 o' clock,

672
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:53,508
What?

673
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:54,588
Come on, the mechanic just called,

674
00:25:54,612 --> 00:25:56,129
your car's ready.

675
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,547
Damn, definitely no sleep.

676
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,503
Your car ready, what you gon' do?

677
00:26:00,545 --> 00:26:01,941
What happened to your car?

678
00:26:01,983 --> 00:26:02,983
I dunno.

679
00:26:03,776 --> 00:26:06,377
What you mean, you don't know?

680
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,838
Man, I'll just go get the car.

681
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:11,428
Always waking me up on some bullshit.

682
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:14,960
Well I don't see no reason
why you sleep at 12, anyway.

683
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:17,999
You should be up, being
productive, let's go.

684
00:26:18,041 --> 00:26:19,791
I had a long night.

685
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:24,419
Okay, so, what happened to your car?

686
00:26:24,461 --> 00:26:27,180
Man... Your insurance gon' go up.

687
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,596
Just go on and tell me.

688
00:26:29,638 --> 00:26:31,324
Kurtis scratched my car up, man.

689
00:26:31,366 --> 00:26:32,955
Now see, your so-called friends

690
00:26:32,997 --> 00:26:34,694

691
00:26:34,736 --> 00:26:36,936
Now, where is Kurt at, now?

692
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,430
I don't know... Is he gonna have to

693
00:26:38,454 --> 00:26:39,930
get it repaired?

694
00:26:39,972 --> 00:26:41,568
- Probably not.
- You know what?

695
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:43,358
Don't even worry about it, let's go.

696
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,164
[Juice] You be trippin'.

697
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:46,560
I'm not tripping. (door squeaking)

698
00:26:46,584 --> 00:26:49,501
You know the insurance gonna go up.

699
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,493
(net swooshing)

700
00:26:51,535 --> 00:26:54,202
(ball bouncing)

701
00:26:56,716 --> 00:26:58,343
(hoop rattling)

702
00:26:58,385 --> 00:27:01,573
(ball bouncing) (mumbling)

703
00:27:01,615 --> 00:27:02,819
Hey, this the guy I
was telling you about.

704
00:27:02,843 --> 00:27:03,634
This Juice, man.

705
00:27:03,676 --> 00:27:04,676
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.

706
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:06,244
He supposed to be the one, man.

707
00:27:06,286 --> 00:27:07,077
The prospect.

708
00:27:07,119 --> 00:27:08,429
- Yes sir.
- See, we gotta put our money

709
00:27:08,453 --> 00:27:09,822
on this nigga, then, man.

710
00:27:09,864 --> 00:27:12,498
And that boy still hitting
that motherfuckin' dunker, man.

711
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,331
In the dark.

712
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:15,619
I hear you goin' to college, Juice, man.

713
00:27:15,661 --> 00:27:17,984
Yes sir, trying to make something happen.

714
00:27:18,026 --> 00:27:20,456
Man, see, you the only nigga
that made it out the hood,

715
00:27:20,498 --> 00:27:21,745
bruh, for real.

716
00:27:21,787 --> 00:27:23,037
Been a minute.

717
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,128
I'm tryin' to be.

718
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:25,853
Make it to college, and
then hit the league.

719
00:27:25,877 --> 00:27:28,478
What's old boy from Petersburg?

720
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,311
Travis.

721
00:27:29,353 --> 00:27:31,005
Shit, Travis... Boy, fuck that.

722
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:31,838
This nigga-

723
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:34,426
Fuck the color shit, we
gonna get us some money.

724
00:27:34,468 --> 00:27:35,894
We tryin' to put some money in your pocket.

725
00:27:35,918 --> 00:27:37,428
Like that nigga, LeBron.

726
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,958
Nigga the next LeBron.
Oh, that sound good.

727
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,376
Get some money in your
pocket, see, and the whole time,

728
00:27:42,418 --> 00:27:43,966
we put money in our pocket.

729
00:27:44,008 --> 00:27:45,775
You need something while you on the road-

730
00:27:45,817 --> 00:27:47,085
- Need some shoes?
- You know he chasin'

731
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,110
- a little bit of hoes.
- Need a new pair

732
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,246
of shoes or something, man?

733
00:27:49,288 --> 00:27:50,079
[Juice] Do I?

734
00:27:50,121 --> 00:27:51,892
I don't even think LeBron
can guard this, dog.

735
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,912
Don't think about
getting no (indistinct).

736
00:27:53,954 --> 00:27:55,314
You gon' bust them bitches.

737
00:27:55,356 --> 00:27:57,599
(guffawing)

738
00:27:57,641 --> 00:27:59,797
(mumbling)

739
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:02,533
- Yeah, good shot.
- Yes sir.

740
00:28:02,575 --> 00:28:05,490
Prospect, number one prospect.

741
00:28:05,532 --> 00:28:08,791
(crosstalk)
- Number one.

742
00:28:08,833 --> 00:28:09,861
Yes sir.

743
00:28:09,903 --> 00:28:11,605
Hey, young boy, lemme me see that.

744
00:28:11,647 --> 00:28:13,391
Let me see if I still got it.

745
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:14,224
You got-

746
00:28:14,266 --> 00:28:15,821
Lemme see.

747
00:28:15,863 --> 00:28:18,055
(net swooshing) (exclaiming)

748
00:28:18,097 --> 00:28:18,888
My boy!

749
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,017
- I'll get with you, though.
- Yes sir.

750
00:28:20,041 --> 00:28:20,920
Hey, keep it up, baby.

751
00:28:20,962 --> 00:28:22,146
My money on you, I'm countin' on you, baby.

752
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:22,961
You still

753
00:28:23,003 --> 00:28:24,821
- had that shit, boy.
- I still got it!

754
00:28:24,863 --> 00:28:27,300
But I'm betting on the young boys, now.

755
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:28,406
I'm betting on the young boys.

756
00:28:28,430 --> 00:28:29,565
Ain't know you still have it.

757
00:28:29,589 --> 00:28:31,650
Yeah, I'm bettin' on the young'uns.

758
00:28:31,692 --> 00:28:35,025
(reverent choral music)

759
00:28:43,732 --> 00:28:47,982
(reverent choral music continuing)

760
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,390
What you got on, girl?

761
00:28:55,432 --> 00:28:58,951
Oh, you know I love that Versace robe.

762
00:28:58,993 --> 00:29:01,031
Nah, nah, nah, I was just seeing-

763
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,645
what you and the girls doing next weekend?

764
00:29:02,669 --> 00:29:05,780
Y'all trying to go out to The Bahamas?

765
00:29:05,822 --> 00:29:07,850
Do I got it covered?

766
00:29:07,892 --> 00:29:10,741
Trust me man, I just
came up with enough cash.

767
00:29:10,783 --> 00:29:13,490
We'll be straight for a while.

768
00:29:13,532 --> 00:29:14,532
Yeah.

769
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:16,984
Okay, okay.

770
00:29:18,202 --> 00:29:20,679
All right, so, you tap in with them,

771
00:29:20,721 --> 00:29:22,221
and I'll tap in with you,

772
00:29:22,263 --> 00:29:25,010
and we'll make it work, all right?

773
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:26,052
Say no more.

774
00:29:27,622 --> 00:29:30,359
Why would I be worrying about that?

775
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,613
You should be worrying about-

776
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,113
- What's good, nigga?

777
00:29:33,155 --> 00:29:34,504
(suspenseful music) Huh?

778
00:29:34,546 --> 00:29:36,864
They say you got all the
fuckin' drugs in the city.

779
00:29:36,906 --> 00:29:38,751
But you know, nigga, this
is my fuckin' city, nigga.

780
00:29:38,775 --> 00:29:40,373
I've been locked up.

781
00:29:40,415 --> 00:29:41,322
[Dealer] Oh yeah?

782
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,615
You heard right then, brother.

783
00:29:43,657 --> 00:29:44,576
I like the grills you got

784
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,071
in your motherfuckin' mouth, too, nigga.

785
00:29:46,095 --> 00:29:47,753
It cost more than you, nigga.

786
00:29:47,795 --> 00:29:49,342
Nigga, what, I'll
kill your ass right now,

787
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:50,850
you keep running your motherfuckin' mouth.

788
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:51,874
Give the money, nigga.

789
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:54,183
Hey, you got it, you got it.

790
00:29:54,225 --> 00:29:55,132
Gimme, nigga.

791
00:29:55,174 --> 00:29:56,523
You got it this time, but you ever come

792
00:29:56,547 --> 00:30:00,630
lookin' for me, I'll kill
your motherfuckin' ass.

793
00:30:03,926 --> 00:30:05,885
Sean Bryan, how you doing, man?

794
00:30:05,927 --> 00:30:06,994
What's up coach?

795
00:30:07,036 --> 00:30:08,310
- Man, it's been a minute.
- Yes sir.

796
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:10,913
You ain't even play on the team last year.

797
00:30:10,955 --> 00:30:12,800
You still playing basketball
though, ain't you?

798
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:13,850
Oh, yeah, you know that.

799
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:15,291
You still playing point guard?

800
00:30:15,333 --> 00:30:16,203
Always.

801
00:30:16,245 --> 00:30:18,562
- Best point guard I ever had.
- Appreciate that.

802
00:30:18,604 --> 00:30:20,581
You know the big street
tournaments coming up, don't you?

803
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:21,912
Oh yeah, I heard about it.

804
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:23,683
Yeah man, I need a good point guard,

805
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:25,454
if you're interested in playing in it.

806
00:30:25,496 --> 00:30:29,413
(dramatic hip hop piano music)

807
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:43,754
(dramatic hip hop piano music continuing)

808
00:30:43,796 --> 00:30:45,586
[Stacy] I just been thinking about us.

809
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:48,044
You know, we've been
friends since grade school.

810
00:30:48,086 --> 00:30:50,438
Who would've thought we
would go to college together?

811
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,579
I know right?

812
00:30:51,621 --> 00:30:53,221
I just hope everything falls into place,

813
00:30:53,255 --> 00:30:54,919
'cause I ain't trying
to stay in those dorms.

814
00:30:54,943 --> 00:30:56,798
You know what, you don't
have to stay in the dorm.

815
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:58,389
You can always live
with me, my parents will

816
00:30:58,413 --> 00:31:01,041
get me an apartment across from campus.

817
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:02,989
[Juice] So you trying to stay together?

818
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:04,559
Well you know what?

819
00:31:04,601 --> 00:31:05,910
We can stay together,
but don't think you gonna

820
00:31:05,934 --> 00:31:08,051
bring them thots in and out my house.

821
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:09,203
What thots?

822
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:11,481
You know I ain't focusing on no thots.

823
00:31:11,523 --> 00:31:14,152
M-hm, yeah. (chuckling)

824
00:31:14,194 --> 00:31:15,194
Okay.

825
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:18,372
I can't stay with you.

826
00:31:18,414 --> 00:31:19,841
You know your Pops will kill me.

827
00:31:19,883 --> 00:31:21,197
What the hell, but you practically stayed

828
00:31:21,221 --> 00:31:23,627
at my house every day, Juice.

829
00:31:23,669 --> 00:31:26,309
Staying over and living
together is different.

830
00:31:26,351 --> 00:31:30,298
Plus you a virgin, Pop's perfect princess.

831
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,463
Whatever, I'm not gonna
be a virgin for long.

832
00:31:33,505 --> 00:31:36,002
Wait, wait, wait, what
that supposed to mean?

833
00:31:36,044 --> 00:31:37,581
Don't worry about what it means.

834
00:31:37,623 --> 00:31:39,400
Why do you care anyway?

835
00:31:39,442 --> 00:31:41,232
Come on Stacy, you know I care.

836
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:42,274
You know me.

837
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:45,457
[Stacy] Yeah, I know you.

838
00:31:46,627 --> 00:31:50,516
Come on, Stacy, we don't
keep secrets from each other.

839
00:31:50,558 --> 00:31:52,475
Are you seeing someone?

840
00:31:52,517 --> 00:31:54,122
No, I'm not seeing anyone.

841
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,910
The one that I want doesn't
even notice me for me.

842
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,257
What if he does notice?

843
00:32:00,299 --> 00:32:01,728
Juice.

844
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,770
Stacy.

845
00:32:05,013 --> 00:32:06,346
Juice, I want-

846
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:10,193
- Hold up, don't even finish that sentence.

847
00:32:10,225 --> 00:32:13,144
See, that's what I'm talking about.

848
00:32:13,186 --> 00:32:15,112
Stacy, hold up, hold up, hold up.

849
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:17,702
Wait, it ain't even like that.

850
00:32:17,744 --> 00:32:19,175
We've been friends for a long time.

851
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:22,543
I love you and I don't want
our friendship to mess up.

852
00:32:22,585 --> 00:32:23,585
I know.

853
00:32:24,477 --> 00:32:26,406
Come on Stacy, I don't
ever wanna lose you.

854
00:32:26,448 --> 00:32:30,943
I love you too, you'll
never lose me, I promise.

855
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:32,423
All right, but if we do decide this,

856
00:32:32,447 --> 00:32:33,694
let's just take it slow.

857
00:32:33,736 --> 00:32:35,903
Oh, so we gonna do this?

858
00:32:36,819 --> 00:32:37,610
I guess.

859
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:39,495
(laughing)
- Oh, don't do that.

860
00:32:39,537 --> 00:32:40,663
See, I knew you wanted me.

861
00:32:40,705 --> 00:32:42,445
Oh, whatever, you wanted me too.

862
00:32:42,487 --> 00:32:43,413
(chuckling)

863
00:32:43,455 --> 00:32:45,081
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I got some good news.

864
00:32:45,105 --> 00:32:46,204
Okay.

865
00:32:46,246 --> 00:32:48,604
Coach want me to play in this big game.

866
00:32:48,646 --> 00:32:50,903
I'm gonna be on the
north side and if we win,

867
00:32:50,945 --> 00:32:52,262
I'm gonna have enough
money to get my apartment

868
00:32:52,286 --> 00:32:53,115
for the whole year.

869
00:32:53,157 --> 00:32:54,614
Oh, what's up, what's up?

870
00:32:54,656 --> 00:32:55,605
Oh my god-

871
00:32:55,647 --> 00:32:57,181
What you mean, if you win?

872
00:32:57,223 --> 00:33:00,354
You were the recruiter's number one pick.

873
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:02,464
You were the best player in the district.

874
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:03,784
- Oh my God.
- You right.

875
00:33:03,826 --> 00:33:05,863
I'm so happy for you.

876
00:33:05,905 --> 00:33:07,404
You gonna win.

877
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:08,446
Oh my God.

- That's it?
- Yeah.

881
00:33:14,098 --> 00:33:15,639

1061
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:31,619
Really?

1062
00:40:31,661 --> 00:40:33,726
Did he not just get the fuck out?

1063
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:35,134
He used to keep money in my pocket.

1064
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:35,990
I had to look out for him.

1065
00:40:36,032 --> 00:40:37,377
That's not the point.

1066
00:40:37,419 --> 00:40:40,517
Since Mama died, I've
done everything I can.

1067
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:43,196
I know, I know... That was my promise.

1068
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:45,227
To stick together.

1069
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:46,534
[Juice] I know, and I'm grateful-

1070
00:40:46,558 --> 00:40:48,688
- We all that we have left.

1071
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:50,876
But you taking a risk
every time you go out here

1072
00:40:50,918 --> 00:40:53,546
and do this stupid shit.

1073
00:40:53,588 --> 00:40:55,576
You got me here, stressed out.

1074
00:40:55,618 --> 00:40:57,236
You don't call, like I said.

1075
00:40:57,278 --> 00:41:00,153
I don't even know where
you be at half the time.

1076
00:41:00,195 --> 00:41:02,838
And it's unfair to me to have to sit here,

1077
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,070
and worry about you like that.

1078
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:06,596
Look man, I said I'm good.

1079
00:41:06,638 --> 00:41:08,007
Capone got me, so I got him.

1080
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:10,245
Man, I don't wanna hear shit
about motherfuckin' Capone.

1081
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:11,486
Because at this point right now,

1082
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,395
the way I feel about him,
and what he put me through

1083
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:15,713
when we was dating,

1084
00:41:15,755 --> 00:41:20,755
that's the last name you
should ever mention around me.

1085
00:41:20,813 --> 00:41:22,300
(sighing)

1086
00:41:22,342 --> 00:41:23,709
[Juice] Man, just hit me up.

1087
00:41:23,751 --> 00:41:26,000
It's not the point of hitting you up.

1088
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:28,087
We need to figure out how
to get you out this situation

1089
00:41:28,111 --> 00:41:30,694
and cut his ass off completely.

1090
00:41:31,581 --> 00:41:35,520
Before you both will be
in the same damn cell.

1091
00:41:35,562 --> 00:41:38,979
So what we gonna do about this situation?

1092
00:41:39,879 --> 00:41:41,010
I mean come on, you-

1093
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:44,390
we got to do something, and
we got to do something fast.

1094
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:45,868
Because the way you going right now,

1095
00:41:45,892 --> 00:41:49,010
you either gonna be dead
or locked up with his ass.

1096
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:51,770
And I'm not about to let
either one of those happen.

1097
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:52,679
I got it.

1098
00:41:52,721 --> 00:41:53,512
Don't worry about it,

1099
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:54,619
I got it. (snapping fingers)

1100
00:41:54,643 --> 00:41:55,434
I mean, come on.

1101
00:41:55,476 --> 00:41:56,650
[Juice] I got it.

1102
00:41:56,692 --> 00:41:57,949
And that's that same
(clapping emphatically)

1103
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,790
attitude that I hate about you.

1104
00:41:59,832 --> 00:42:00,849
I said I got it!

1105
00:42:00,891 --> 00:42:01,682
It ain't the-

1106
00:42:01,724 --> 00:42:04,149
- Well you know what, since
you want to carry it like that.

1107
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,288
Nigga, that's why I ain't even cook.

1108
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:07,199
Go fix a fuckin' sandwich.

1109
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:08,927
(mumbling angrily)

1110
00:42:08,969 --> 00:42:09,760
You know what nigga?

1111
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:11,127
That's why you ate good all these years,

1112
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:13,309
you still maining and containing.

1113
00:42:13,351 --> 00:42:14,487
And I tell you what, you better not touch

1114
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:16,118
my fuckin' Kool-Aid either.

1115
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,216
[Juice] I don't even drink
Kool-Aid, I drink Gatorade.

1116
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:21,178
Oh, you uppity, nigga, okay that's good.

1117
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:24,220
(suspenseful music)

1118
00:42:28,952 --> 00:42:30,311
Good morning, detectives.

1119
00:42:30,353 --> 00:42:31,801
I don't know if you guys have heard it,

1120
00:42:31,825 --> 00:42:33,200
but an informant was murdered.

1121
00:42:33,242 --> 00:42:35,394
No captain, we wasn't aware.

1122
00:42:35,436 --> 00:42:40,061
Well, to get you up to
speed, it was an FBI informant.

1123
00:42:40,103 --> 00:42:43,797
So Captain, do we have any
lead suspects, witnesses?

1124
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,373
Sources say that it could be
Detective Kenyatta's nephew.

1125
00:42:47,415 --> 00:42:51,314
I want y'all to bring
him in for questioning.

1126
00:42:51,356 --> 00:42:53,001
- Okay Captain.
- We'll be right on it.

1127
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:53,973
Now listen,

1128
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:56,118
I don't need y'all messing around on this,

1129
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,913
because the FBI's on my
head about this case.

1130
00:42:58,955 --> 00:43:00,965
So I need y'all to be on it, okay?

1131
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:01,798
Okay.

1132
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,007
All right, y'all can go.

1133
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:10,672
Yo.

1134
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,108
Yo, what up, Juice?

1135
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:13,421
What's good with it. (hands slapping)

1136
00:43:13,445 --> 00:43:14,616
Nothin' much man.

1137
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:15,449
Juice.

1138
00:43:15,491 --> 00:43:16,532
(hands slapping)
- What's good with it?

1139
00:43:16,556 --> 00:43:17,834
Funny thing, how we ran into you, though.

1140
00:43:17,858 --> 00:43:18,649
Yeah.

1141
00:43:18,691 --> 00:43:20,876
Y'know, so you playing
in the league this year?

1142
00:43:20,918 --> 00:43:23,096
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
take my talents out there.

1143
00:43:23,138 --> 00:43:24,692
Okay, okay, well, why don't you come play

1144
00:43:24,716 --> 00:43:26,192
for the south side?

1145
00:43:26,234 --> 00:43:28,344
Mm, south side?

1146
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:29,865
Yeah, south side, man.

1147
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,107
You know where we at.

1148
00:43:31,149 --> 00:43:33,850
I already holler at the
boys on the north, though.

1149
00:43:33,892 --> 00:43:34,814
You holler at the boys of the-

1150
00:43:34,856 --> 00:43:35,809
Forget them, man.

1151
00:43:35,851 --> 00:43:37,888
They don't need you, we need you.

1152
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:39,119
Okay, south side.

1153
00:43:39,161 --> 00:43:41,147
- South side.
- What's in it for me?

1154
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:42,935
$50,000, that's the pot.

1155
00:43:42,977 --> 00:43:44,609
We can all split it.

1156
00:43:44,651 --> 00:43:46,284
- Split?
- That's big money, man.

1157
00:43:46,326 --> 00:43:47,769
That sounds good, but I already

1158
00:43:47,811 --> 00:43:49,369
committed to the north side.

1159
00:43:49,411 --> 00:43:50,202
North side?

1160
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:51,209
North side don't need you.

1161
00:43:51,251 --> 00:43:52,231
We need you, man.

1162
00:43:52,273 --> 00:43:53,180
(scoffing)

1163
00:43:53,222 --> 00:43:54,811
(mumbling)

1164
00:43:54,853 --> 00:43:56,913
Come on man, you on the
south side right now.

1165
00:43:56,955 --> 00:43:58,376
South side is where it's at, baby.

1166
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,360
Man, I'm good everywhere.

1167
00:43:59,402 --> 00:44:01,159
But I already committed, though.

1168
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:02,452
Look, you know who you playing for?

1169
00:44:02,476 --> 00:44:04,724
It's me, Cody, man.

1170
00:44:04,766 --> 00:44:07,231
Do you do you not know-

1171
00:44:07,273 --> 00:44:10,973
Four years in college, if I
hadn't blown out my ACL, man,

1172
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,113
I would've been up there with Iverson.

1173
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:14,378
Much respect, I respect that.

1174
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,001
I definitely respect you.

1175
00:44:16,043 --> 00:44:18,794
Look man, I'm leading
triple doubles baby.

1176
00:44:18,836 --> 00:44:19,627
You know what I'm saying?

1177
00:44:19,669 --> 00:44:22,143
Leading score, assist, and defense.

1178
00:44:22,185 --> 00:44:23,824
Can't beat that, bruh.

1179
00:44:23,866 --> 00:44:24,657
He ain't with that-

1180
00:44:24,699 --> 00:44:27,093
- So, I don't think you
want to play against me.

1181
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:28,967
So it's best to be on my team.

1182
00:44:29,009 --> 00:44:31,176
Oh nah, see, that sounds
like a challenge, baby.

1183
00:44:31,218 --> 00:44:33,266
You know I ain't backing
down from no challenge.

1184
00:44:33,308 --> 00:44:34,465
Bruh, you don't want to do that.

1185
00:44:34,489 --> 00:44:35,489
Hey.

1186
00:44:36,544 --> 00:44:38,693
So you don't wanna be on the south side?

1187
00:44:38,735 --> 00:44:42,156
Man, fuck you and the north side, man.

1188
00:44:42,198 --> 00:44:43,848
(scoffing)
- Yeah, all right,

1189
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,465
like I said, have y'all money ready.

1190
00:44:45,507 --> 00:44:46,887
Have our money ready?

1191
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:47,755
You right... You gon' disrespect

1192
00:44:47,797 --> 00:44:49,552
the OG like that though, dog?

1193
00:44:49,594 --> 00:44:50,732
You gonna-

1194
00:44:50,774 --> 00:44:52,050
- Man, fuck Juice, man.

1195
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,886
Man, I can't believe this nigga.

1196
00:44:53,928 --> 00:44:56,083
Look, he probably got problems

1197
00:44:56,125 --> 00:44:57,624
paying tuition and everything, man.

1198
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,383
Still eating Ramen noodles and shit, man.

1199
00:44:59,425 --> 00:45:00,631
That nigga named Juice, right?

1200
00:45:00,655 --> 00:45:01,546
- Yeah, he juice.
- Put the squeeze

1201
00:45:01,588 --> 00:45:02,379
on that motherfucker.

1202
00:45:02,421 --> 00:45:03,427
Put the squeeze on him, let's do it.

1203
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:05,824
But, we do need him.

1204
00:45:05,866 --> 00:45:08,004
You still don't know
who the fuck I am, do you?

1205
00:45:08,046 --> 00:45:10,129
(tsking)

1206
00:45:14,707 --> 00:45:16,990
I just heard about the third killing,

1207
00:45:17,032 --> 00:45:18,441
and this whole entire scene.

1208
00:45:18,483 --> 00:45:20,319
Now, this happened to be a very big one.

1209
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:25,194
'Cause otherwise, Captain
would not have us come this far.

1210
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:27,000
Detectives.

1211
00:45:27,042 --> 00:45:28,309
- Captain.
- Good morning.

1212
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:29,700
How you doing?

1213
00:45:29,742 --> 00:45:30,988
Detective Kenyatta.

1214
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:33,868
Sources say your nephew's car was spotted

1215
00:45:33,910 --> 00:45:35,910
leaving the crime scene.

1216
00:45:37,288 --> 00:45:39,879
You are kidding me, right?

1217
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:42,828
We're not 100% sure, but evidence shows

1218
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,039
that it could be your nephew's car.

1219
00:45:45,081 --> 00:45:48,139
So, we're not a hundred percent sure

1220
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:51,030
that it could be his nephew's car.

1221
00:45:51,072 --> 00:45:53,698
Well the both of you will
get to the bottom of this.

1222
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,670
I will not have the FBI
take over this case.

1223
00:45:56,712 --> 00:45:59,160
We don't want it
either, but I mean, damn,

1224
00:45:59,202 --> 00:46:01,087
you just gave us this and we need to-

1225
00:46:01,129 --> 00:46:02,469
- Did you hear what I said?

1226
00:46:02,511 --> 00:46:03,360
I heard what you said.

1227
00:46:03,402 --> 00:46:05,035
Okay, well, I need you to get on the job.

1228
00:46:05,059 --> 00:46:06,366
I am your superior.

1229
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:07,589
You listen to me.

1230
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,775
You don't come in here
telling me what to do.

1231
00:46:09,817 --> 00:46:11,769
Oh and by the way, detective Kenyatta,

1232
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:13,629
I've already sent two of my guys

1233
00:46:13,671 --> 00:46:16,259
to bring in your nephew for questioning.

1234
00:46:16,301 --> 00:46:19,097
I mean, come on, Cap', listen.

1235
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:21,727
This cannot be his nephew.

1236
00:46:21,769 --> 00:46:25,410
He's like family to me, too,
and I know my damn friend-

1237
00:46:25,452 --> 00:46:27,136
- Hold on, we not in here for family.

1238
00:46:27,178 --> 00:46:29,095
We in here to do a job.

1239
00:46:30,426 --> 00:46:31,952
Don't make me take your badge,

1240
00:46:31,994 --> 00:46:33,970
because you will be out
there answering phone calls

1241
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:35,660
for the rest of the damn month.

1242
00:46:35,702 --> 00:46:37,403
You want to take this badge?

1243
00:46:37,445 --> 00:46:39,125
Fine, fuck it. (badge clattering loudly)

1244
00:46:39,167 --> 00:46:40,730
You can leave your gun,
too, while you at it.

1245
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:42,754
And don't expect no pay!

1246
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:48,085
Captain, my nephew has
never been in any trouble.

1247
00:46:48,127 --> 00:46:50,877
I just cannot see him doing this.

1248
00:46:52,535 --> 00:46:54,284
Captain, he's going to college.

1249
00:46:54,326 --> 00:46:56,660
He's going to do something with his life.

1250
00:46:56,702 --> 00:46:59,593
We are going to find who really did this

1251
00:46:59,635 --> 00:47:02,765
because I know deep in my heart

1252
00:47:02,807 --> 00:47:05,390
that my nephew did not do this.

1253
00:47:11,097 --> 00:47:12,074
(sighing)

1254
00:47:12,116 --> 00:47:14,895
Captain, I'm sorry for the outburst.

1255
00:47:14,937 --> 00:47:16,427
(stammering)

1256
00:47:16,469 --> 00:47:18,375
There's no excuse, but
it just don't make sense

1257
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:21,687
that his nephew, it's more like-

1258
00:47:21,729 --> 00:47:22,827
He's like a brother to me.

1259
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:26,897
My nephew is going through this situation.

1260
00:47:26,939 --> 00:47:29,154
All these innocent, young, black men

1261
00:47:29,196 --> 00:47:31,445
constantly getting arrested and you just

1262
00:47:31,487 --> 00:47:34,434
have him brought in here
without even consulting us first.

1263
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,082
That's his nephew, you
should have consulted him first.

1264
00:47:37,124 --> 00:47:38,382
That's all I'm saying.

1265
00:47:38,424 --> 00:47:40,016
But I understand you're doing your job

1266
00:47:40,058 --> 00:47:42,352
and I want to get to the bottom of-

1267
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:44,843
I promise you, we going to
get to the bottom of it.

1268
00:47:44,885 --> 00:47:47,920
[Captain] I'm depending on
you guys to crack this case.

1269
00:47:47,962 --> 00:47:49,165
- We will.
- I ain't sayin' nothing

1270
00:47:49,189 --> 00:47:49,980
but a word.

1271
00:47:50,022 --> 00:47:51,772
- We will.
- Let's go.

1272
00:48:00,286 --> 00:48:02,869
(humming tune)

1273
00:48:14,618 --> 00:48:17,165
Sean Bryan, we need
to have a word with you.

1274
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:18,064
About what?

1275
00:48:18,106 --> 00:48:20,323
Mr. Bryant, we need to take
you down to the precinct.

1276
00:48:20,365 --> 00:48:23,986
We got a serious matter
to question you about.

1277
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:25,704
For what?

1278
00:48:25,746 --> 00:48:26,874
You don't need to worry about that.

1279
00:48:26,898 --> 00:48:28,203
You need to just come with us.

1280
00:48:28,245 --> 00:48:29,036
Come on.

1281
00:48:29,078 --> 00:48:29,869
Man, I ain't-

1282
00:48:29,911 --> 00:48:30,702
- Come on.

1283
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:31,535
Come on man.

1284
00:48:31,577 --> 00:48:32,368
You tripping.

1285
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,579
Come on.

1286
00:48:33,621 --> 00:48:37,788
(shoes scraping against concrete)

1287
00:48:38,795 --> 00:48:41,333
(distant speaking)

1288
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:42,883
(slapping fist)
- That 50 stacks.

1289
00:48:42,925 --> 00:48:44,841
50 stacks, baby, you already know.

1290
00:48:44,883 --> 00:48:47,413
But look, if Juice don't
want to work with us,

1291
00:48:47,455 --> 00:48:49,715
we going to have to doggone get on John.

1292
00:48:49,757 --> 00:48:51,776
Bro, he out here buzzing in the streets.

1293
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:52,609
I know he buzzing.

1294
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:54,403
But that's why we get with John.

1295
00:48:54,445 --> 00:48:57,605
We convince John to throw the game our way.

1296
00:48:57,647 --> 00:48:58,736
Then we win,

1297
00:48:58,778 --> 00:49:00,194
(shoes scraping on concrete)
we secure the spot.

1298
00:49:00,218 --> 00:49:01,114
South side, nigga.

1299
00:49:01,156 --> 00:49:03,328
South side, that's what
I'm talking about, baby.

1300
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,037
Woo! (chains rattling)

1301
00:49:05,079 --> 00:49:09,385
Lord, life is good. Look at
my babies, they're growing.

1302
00:49:09,427 --> 00:49:11,677
Success is in the movement.

1303
00:49:14,143 --> 00:49:15,393
Yes, beautiful.

1304
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,501
What's up John?

1305
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,292
What's going on, what's going on fellas?

1306
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,252
Ah, man, Suzy Homemaker. (hands slapping)

1307
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,020
I see you got the green thumb around here.

1308
00:49:27,062 --> 00:49:28,109
(church bells tolling)
- What's going on?

1309
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:29,502
Always keep a green thumb.

1310
00:49:29,544 --> 00:49:30,570
This is my life, here.

1311
00:49:30,612 --> 00:49:31,861
My plants and everything else,

1312
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,522
and my weed collection over there.

1313
00:49:33,564 --> 00:49:34,355
Oh, word.

1314
00:49:34,397 --> 00:49:35,920
I'll have some of that a little bit later.

1315
00:49:35,944 --> 00:49:37,319
- I bet you do.
- We came to you to talk

1316
00:49:37,343 --> 00:49:39,208
on some serious notes, man.
Serious about what?

1317
00:49:39,232 --> 00:49:43,649
Y'know, we need you to
swing the game our way.

1318
00:49:43,691 --> 00:49:45,359
Swing the game...
South side needs to win.

1319
00:49:45,383 --> 00:49:47,381
South side needs to win the game?

1320
00:49:47,423 --> 00:49:48,288
So, you... Yeah, nigga.

1321
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:49,121
South side.

1322
00:49:49,163 --> 00:49:50,258
South side, bruh.

1323
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,091
- Okay.
- You trying to

1324
00:49:51,133 --> 00:49:52,249
- save the streets, right?
- Yeah, I'm always

1325
00:49:52,273 --> 00:49:53,729
for the community.

1326
00:49:53,771 --> 00:49:55,740
Look, the only way you
gonna save these streets

1327
00:49:55,782 --> 00:49:57,073
is if you vote for south side,

1328
00:49:57,115 --> 00:49:59,331
and daggone ref the game our way.

1329
00:49:59,373 --> 00:50:00,678
- Otherwise, you got a problem.
- Look,

1330
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:04,401
much love, so y'know, save yourself.

1331
00:50:04,443 --> 00:50:06,691
Save yourself, brother. (patting)

1332
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:07,524
Seriously.

1333
00:50:07,566 --> 00:50:11,053
(punching) (grunting)

1334
00:50:11,095 --> 00:50:13,172
(grunting)
- Now do we got

1335
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:15,044
- an understanding?
- Ow, man.

1336
00:50:15,086 --> 00:50:16,877
[Goon] South side, nigga.

1337
00:50:16,919 --> 00:50:20,086
You gonna ref for south side, right?

1338
00:50:21,217 --> 00:50:23,571
Damn, this sounds cool on a mix tape.

1339
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:24,999
Whatever it takes.

1340
00:50:25,041 --> 00:50:26,996
Man, maybe we should hit
this motherfucker again.

1341
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,537
Nah, I think he knows.

1342
00:50:28,579 --> 00:50:30,200
What side, what side?

1343
00:50:30,242 --> 00:50:31,815
South side, man.

1344
00:50:31,857 --> 00:50:32,648
There you go.

1345
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:34,049
Sound like a winner now, eh?

1346
00:50:34,091 --> 00:50:36,096
Hey, bag me up some weed, too.

1347
00:50:36,138 --> 00:50:37,218
(giggling)

1348
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:38,670
(groaning)

1349
00:50:38,712 --> 00:50:41,879
Street thugs, street thugs eat shit.

1350
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:45,859
(hip hop music)

1351
00:50:48,130 --> 00:50:49,380
Hello, Captain.

1352
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:53,012
My name is Detective Ray and this is-

1353
00:50:53,054 --> 00:50:54,410
- Detective Kittles.

1354
00:50:54,452 --> 00:50:55,433
[Captain] It's nice to meet you.

1355
00:50:55,475 --> 00:50:56,266
[Kittles] Nice to meet you.

1356
00:50:56,308 --> 00:51:00,725
You have a case that we
are mutually interested in,

1357
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:04,048
and we would like to question the gentleman

1358
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,649
that you have in custody.

1359
00:51:06,691 --> 00:51:08,622
Hold on, wait, this is our case.

1360
00:51:08,664 --> 00:51:10,253
We had this case first.

1361
00:51:10,295 --> 00:51:11,295
[Ray] That's true.

1362
00:51:11,332 --> 00:51:12,993
But the problem with that is-

1363
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:14,851
the guy that you have in custody,

1364
00:51:14,893 --> 00:51:16,572
we believe he's our guy.

1365
00:51:16,614 --> 00:51:19,074
There was an informant that we had,

1366
00:51:19,116 --> 00:51:22,169
that we were working
with, and he was murdered.

1367
00:51:22,211 --> 00:51:24,331
So we really need to talk to your guy.

1368
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,484
It's not up for debate.

1369
00:51:26,526 --> 00:51:29,723
We've got evidence, it's
really starting to mount up,

1370
00:51:29,765 --> 00:51:33,098
and it's imperative that we talk to him.

1371
00:51:33,974 --> 00:51:36,651
And the sooner the better.

1372
00:51:36,693 --> 00:51:37,822
Okay, well how about this then?

1373
00:51:37,846 --> 00:51:40,170
Could we, at least, be a part of this case?

1374
00:51:40,212 --> 00:51:41,713
I don't see a problem in that.

1375
00:51:41,755 --> 00:51:45,263
As long as your men stay out of the way.

1376
00:51:45,305 --> 00:51:49,245
Don't get too involved
and take just a step back.

1377
00:51:49,287 --> 00:51:50,851
And let us have the lead.

1378
00:51:50,893 --> 00:51:51,913
You got my word.

1379
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:53,114
Okay.

1380
00:51:53,156 --> 00:51:55,001
What interrogation room
are you holdin' him in?

1381
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:55,875
[Captain] Room three.

1382
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:57,332
And what direction is that?

1383
00:51:57,374 --> 00:51:58,400
Down the hall, to your left.

1384
00:51:58,424 --> 00:51:59,221
Thank you.

1385
00:51:59,263 --> 00:52:01,994
[Kittles] Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1386
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:06,119
(chair clattering) Motherfuckers.

1387
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:13,716
Sean Bryant, I think
you know why we're here.

1388
00:52:13,758 --> 00:52:17,469
- I'm Detective Ray.
- I'm Detective Kittles.

1389
00:52:17,511 --> 00:52:18,447
[Juice] How y'all doing?

1390
00:52:18,489 --> 00:52:19,828
I don't know why I'm here, but-

1391
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:21,227
- You don't have any idea?

1392
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:22,528
[Juice] No ma'am.

1393
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,218
[Ray] Where were you
at last Wednesday night?

1394
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,833
Walk me through your day.

1395
00:52:26,875 --> 00:52:28,196
Mm.

1396
00:52:28,238 --> 00:52:31,116
Wednesday, early in the
morning, I had a workout

1397
00:52:31,158 --> 00:52:33,389
at the field house, y'know,

1398
00:52:33,431 --> 00:52:35,548
running up a couple bleachers.

1399
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:38,754
That afternoon, I met
with my girlfriend Stacy.

1400
00:52:38,796 --> 00:52:40,379
We went out to eat.

1401
00:52:41,352 --> 00:52:42,672
[Ray] I'm gonna stop you there.

1402
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:45,510
Take note of of his girlfriend's name.

1403
00:52:45,552 --> 00:52:47,568
What's your girlfriend's name?

1404
00:52:47,610 --> 00:52:48,634
[Juice] Stacy.

1405
00:52:48,676 --> 00:52:50,593
I need her full name.

1406
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:54,473
[Juice] Stacy Marie Johnson.

1407
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:56,848
And how can I contact her?

1408
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,807
[Juice] Facebook, I guess.

1409
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:02,539
No, I need her contact information.

1410
00:53:02,581 --> 00:53:04,086
[Ray] Does she live with you?
Phone number?

1411
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:05,842
[Juice] No she doesn't,
she lives with her parents.

1412
00:53:05,866 --> 00:53:06,949
[Ray] Okay.

1413
00:53:09,169 --> 00:53:11,186
What's her phone number?

1414
00:53:11,228 --> 00:53:14,478
It's (434) 222-9834.

1415
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,651
[Kittles] Okay.

1416
00:53:18,693 --> 00:53:20,171
And she'll be able to alibi

1417
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:21,762
that you were with her the entire time?

1418
00:53:21,786 --> 00:53:23,370
[Juice] Yes.

1419
00:53:23,412 --> 00:53:24,495
[Ray] Okay.

1420
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:29,925
We've got evidence that states otherwise.

1421
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:32,300
So if we go looking further,

1422
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:36,904
is there anything that you
think you need to tell us now?

1423
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:39,176
Because you'll be in less
trouble if you tell us now.

1424
00:53:39,218 --> 00:53:40,313
If you don't tell us now,

1425
00:53:40,355 --> 00:53:43,175
we can't help you later on down the road.

1426
00:53:43,217 --> 00:53:45,433
We've got evidence that says otherwise.

1427
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:49,483
So you might as well tell
us, because if you don't,

1428
00:53:49,525 --> 00:53:52,382
there's nothing we can do for you later on.

1429
00:53:52,424 --> 00:53:55,174
So if there's anything you haven't told us,

1430
00:53:55,216 --> 00:53:58,966
now is your best shot
of getting a fair deal.

1431
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,486
Evidence?

1432
00:54:02,528 --> 00:54:03,902
[Ray] Yeah, evidence.

1433
00:54:03,944 --> 00:54:05,864
What kind of evidence do you have?

1434
00:54:05,906 --> 00:54:08,325
[Kittles] Well, we have evidence of a car

1435
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:11,700
that looks just like yours at the scene.

1436
00:54:13,656 --> 00:54:16,136
Look man, I said it's not me.

1437
00:54:16,178 --> 00:54:19,073
I'm tired, I'm hungry and
I gotta go to the gym.

1438
00:54:19,115 --> 00:54:20,592
Can I go?

1439
00:54:20,634 --> 00:54:22,217
Is this your car?

1440
00:54:29,245 --> 00:54:31,325
[Ray] It looks just like your car to us.

1441
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:34,872
You tell us, what are
we supposed to believe?

1442
00:54:34,914 --> 00:54:37,295
So you're gonna deny this.

1443
00:54:37,337 --> 00:54:38,128
It's not me.

1444
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:39,432
There's thousands of Dodge Challengers,

1445
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:42,854
and it could be anybody, it's not me.

1446
00:54:42,896 --> 00:54:45,112
And you expect us to believe this,

1447
00:54:45,154 --> 00:54:48,494
when there are probably
witnesses that we're gonna find,

1448
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:50,773
that are gonna say that you were there.

1449
00:54:50,815 --> 00:54:53,091
[Juice] Well, ask your
witnesses, it's not me.

1450
00:54:53,133 --> 00:54:54,876
I'm telling you, it's not me.

1451
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:58,534
This is your one chance,
and you're gonna blow it.

1452
00:54:58,576 --> 00:55:01,053
Do you realize how many
people actually come in here,

1453
00:55:01,095 --> 00:55:03,104
and they sit in that very same chair,

1454
00:55:03,146 --> 00:55:05,397
claiming that they're
innocent, it's not me.

1455
00:55:05,439 --> 00:55:07,372
You've got the wrong person.

1456
00:55:07,414 --> 00:55:10,346
And do you know how many
of those same people

1457
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:13,884
are found later, as being
guilty and they're up there,

1458
00:55:13,926 --> 00:55:15,106
spending time in jail?

1459
00:55:15,148 --> 00:55:16,984
You don't wanna do that.

1460
00:55:17,026 --> 00:55:20,084
You're trying to go to school, right?

1461
00:55:20,126 --> 00:55:20,917
[Juice] Yes, ma'am.

1462
00:55:20,959 --> 00:55:22,314
Okay, then you don't wanna be doing this.

1463
00:55:22,338 --> 00:55:23,852
You don't wanna be lying to us,

1464
00:55:23,894 --> 00:55:26,894
because the truth is gonna come out.

1465
00:55:28,877 --> 00:55:30,052
[Juice] Okay, okay,

1466
00:55:30,094 --> 00:55:32,675
I get it, can I please go now?

1467
00:55:32,717 --> 00:55:35,467
Before we decide to let you go-

1468
00:55:36,765 --> 00:55:37,765
Who's this?

1469
00:55:39,628 --> 00:55:41,011
[Juice] I have no idea.

1470
00:55:41,053 --> 00:55:43,417
You've not seen him anywhere around?

1471
00:55:43,459 --> 00:55:44,973
[Juice] No clue, I have-

1472
00:55:45,015 --> 00:55:47,371
- None of the people you hang out with?

1473
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:50,212
[Juice] No clue, can I go now?

1474
00:55:50,254 --> 00:55:52,394
Well, he was just released from prison,

1475
00:55:52,436 --> 00:55:55,454
and we have surveillance
of him leaving the scene,

1476
00:55:55,496 --> 00:55:59,253
and we believe he has
something to do with it.

1477
00:55:59,295 --> 00:56:03,045
[Ray] Are you sure
you don't know this guy?

1478
00:56:05,373 --> 00:56:08,143
[Juice] Nope, never seen him.

1479
00:56:08,185 --> 00:56:09,722
[Ray] It's very convenient.

1480
00:56:09,764 --> 00:56:11,847
[Juice] Never seen him.

1481
00:56:12,705 --> 00:56:14,370
All right, can I leave now?

1482
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,912
You're free to go, but don't leave town.

1483
00:56:24,195 --> 00:56:26,641
(door shutting) I don't believe him.

1484
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:28,583
No, there's too much evidence.

1485
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:29,874
Yeah, there is.

1486
00:56:29,916 --> 00:56:32,562
I really think he has
something to do with it.

1487
00:56:32,604 --> 00:56:34,222
I think he knows this guy right here.

1488
00:56:34,264 --> 00:56:36,099
He's just not gonna tell us.
I think he does.

1489
00:56:36,123 --> 00:56:38,252
The look on his face, I think he knows him.

1490
00:56:38,294 --> 00:56:39,367
Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.

1491
00:56:39,391 --> 00:56:41,610
And I think they both had
something to do with it.

1492
00:56:41,652 --> 00:56:42,611
I totally agree.

1493
00:56:42,653 --> 00:56:43,927
We've just gotta get to the bottom of it.

1494
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:45,118
Yeah, we do.

1495
00:56:45,974 --> 00:56:48,480
Gotta see if we can't find
some witnesses out there

1496
00:56:48,522 --> 00:56:50,605
- to make our case.
- We do.

1497
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:54,539
(chair creaking)

1498
00:56:58,292 --> 00:56:59,840
We need to go tell the Captain,

1499
00:56:59,882 --> 00:57:01,579
and inform her of what we found out.

1500
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:04,869
Yeah, this captain's not
gonna be too happy with us.

1501
00:57:04,911 --> 00:57:06,161
[Kittles] No.

1502
00:57:13,341 --> 00:57:16,349
Good afternoon detective, Captain.

1503
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,985
[Captain] Good afternoon.

1504
00:57:18,027 --> 00:57:20,283
We talked to the guy,

1505
00:57:20,325 --> 00:57:24,761
and we really think that
he's our guy, y'know?

1506
00:57:24,803 --> 00:57:27,861
I don't think anybody in this precinct

1507
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:30,590
is gonna believe his story, I really don't.

1508
00:57:30,632 --> 00:57:32,996
Everything adds up that it's him.

1509
00:57:33,038 --> 00:57:35,283
And to be honest with you,

1510
00:57:35,325 --> 00:57:38,441
all he's got for an alibi is a girlfriend.

1511
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:41,973
Do you really think that
we're gonna buy that?

1512
00:57:42,015 --> 00:57:43,410
Well, do you guys have any evidence

1513
00:57:43,434 --> 00:57:45,842
that you can use to support this claim?

1514
00:57:45,884 --> 00:57:48,037
Let's be real here.

1515
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:50,692
We're not gonna give
you everything we have.

1516
00:57:50,734 --> 00:57:53,230
I will give you a piece of evidence,

1517
00:57:53,272 --> 00:57:56,683
as I'm sure your team is
doing their own investigation,

1518
00:57:56,725 --> 00:58:00,552
even though we agreed to do this together.

1519
00:58:00,594 --> 00:58:04,349
So, I think it's only fair
that we hold back what we have

1520
00:58:04,391 --> 00:58:06,612
until we get more information.

1521
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:10,812
But I'm gonna share this
little tidbit with you.

1522
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:13,871
We believe he knows who he is.

1523
00:58:13,913 --> 00:58:18,913
[Kittles] And we definitely
believe he's involved as well.

1524
00:58:19,675 --> 00:58:22,225
Let's go somewhere
private and talk about this.

1525
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:25,373
Okay, we can sit down
and have a discussion,

1526
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:27,354
But I'm not gonna change my mind.

1527
00:58:27,396 --> 00:58:29,403
We're not gonna give
you everything we have.

1528
00:58:29,445 --> 00:58:30,236
[Captain] Okay.

1529
00:58:30,278 --> 00:58:31,806
Okay.

1530
00:58:31,848 --> 00:58:32,801
Lead the way.

1531
00:58:32,843 --> 00:58:35,676
(papers rustling)

1532
00:58:37,412 --> 00:58:40,162
(distant sirens)

1533
00:58:43,222 --> 00:58:45,791
Detective Kenyatta, we
have reason to believe

1534
00:58:45,833 --> 00:58:48,736
that your nephew is part of a crime.

1535
00:58:48,778 --> 00:58:52,591
Well, what information
do you have on my nephew?

1536
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:54,312
[Ray] First of all, we're
not gonna give you everything,

1537
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:55,469
like we told your Captain.

1538
00:58:55,511 --> 00:58:57,513
Then we might as well cut this chit-chat

1539
00:58:57,555 --> 00:58:59,594
and just stop it where we at, right now.

1540
00:58:59,636 --> 00:59:01,211
[Ray] No, I don't think
that would be a good idea.

1541
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:03,287
Well, I think it would be awesome because

1542
00:59:03,329 --> 00:59:05,103
one thing for sure, two things for certain-

1543
00:59:05,145 --> 00:59:08,104
y'all not on this case, we are.

1544
00:59:08,146 --> 00:59:10,691
Let me break it down to you like this.

1545
00:59:10,733 --> 00:59:13,229
Do you know who we are?

1546
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,213
Yeah.

1547
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:15,963
[Kittles] We're definitely on it.

1548
00:59:16,005 --> 00:59:18,710
And we can shut you down at any time,

1549
00:59:18,752 --> 00:59:20,471
and we're not gonna have to give you

1550
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:23,501
a shared partnership in this.

1551
00:59:23,543 --> 00:59:25,742
We told your Captain that we would.

1552
00:59:25,784 --> 00:59:27,335
Now y'all wanna play hardball,

1553
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:29,573
we'll shut you down and
we'll just take the case

1554
00:59:29,615 --> 00:59:31,913
and solve it all by ourself.

1555
00:59:31,955 --> 00:59:36,022
It's your choice, the ball's in your court.

1556
00:59:36,064 --> 00:59:38,115
You know what?

1557
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,327
Yeah sure, you'll be able to, y'know,

1558
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,614
chop us down from this, no problem.

1559
00:59:42,656 --> 00:59:44,475
You'll be able to stop
us and take this case.

1560
00:59:44,517 --> 00:59:45,685
But guess what?

1561
00:59:45,727 --> 00:59:47,104
[Ray] What?

1562
00:59:47,146 --> 00:59:50,936
We already on the mission
and we almost finished it.

1563
00:59:50,978 --> 00:59:52,465
Oh by the way, one more thing.

1564
00:59:52,507 --> 00:59:54,236
Why don't you take your little tacky shirt

1565
00:59:54,278 --> 00:59:55,687
and you can get on outta our way,

1566
00:59:55,729 --> 00:59:57,383
and get your little princess too.

1567
00:59:57,425 --> 00:59:59,414
'Cause we about to go finish it, let's go.

1568
00:59:59,456 --> 01:00:02,102
Yeah, we got a case to solve.

1569
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:04,333
Not if we solve it first.

1570
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:07,708
Oh, we gonna beat you to it, princess.

1571
01:00:09,762 --> 01:00:12,345
(serene music)

1572
01:00:14,206 --> 01:00:17,289
(beatboxing quietly)

1573
01:00:21,358 --> 01:00:26,108
Yo, that's that nigga that
took my money the other day.

1574
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,077
Sure is, that's him.

1575
01:00:31,078 --> 01:00:34,609
Yeah, that's him, that's definitely him.

(hoop rattling)

1589
01:01:29,785 --> 01:01:31,462
Hey, yo, college boy,

1590
01:01:31,504 --> 01:01:33,254
you ever met a Ruger?

1591
01:01:34,952 --> 01:01:37,319
Don't nobody come to Grove
and try to take my money,

1592
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:39,238
and live to see it.

1593
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,943
Yeah, you got me the other day.

1594
01:01:41,985 --> 01:01:43,071
You got me.

1595
01:01:43,113 --> 01:01:45,960
You'll never play basketball again.

1596
01:01:46,002 --> 01:01:47,045
Never. (suspenseful music)

1597
01:01:47,087 --> 01:01:49,358
(ball bouncing)

(fence rattling loudly)

1602
01:02:12,185 --> 01:02:14,285
Nigga, I'm gonna get you.

1603
01:02:14,327 --> 01:02:17,142
I'm gonna get you, I'm gon' get you.

1604
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:20,351
(shoes scraping dirt)

1605
01:02:23,184 --> 01:02:26,595

(crickets chirping)

1609
01:02:38,813 --> 01:02:40,084
(chuckling)

1610
01:02:40,126 --> 01:02:42,265
I know you out here.

1611
01:02:42,307 --> 01:02:44,557
Juice, I know you out here.

1612
01:02:45,525 --> 01:02:46,903
I'm gon' find you.

1613
01:02:46,945 --> 01:02:50,172
(crickets chirping)

1614
01:02:50,214 --> 01:02:51,714
I'm gon' find you.

1615
01:02:52,555 --> 01:02:54,222
I know you out here.

1616
01:02:55,676 --> 01:02:57,176
I know you hiding.

1617
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:00,693
You couldn't have got away that fast.

1618
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,318
I was right on you.

1619
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:04,962
I know I'm close.

1620
01:03:05,004 --> 01:03:06,337
I can smell you.

1621
01:03:07,654 --> 01:03:09,904
Juice, Juice, Where you at?

1622
01:03:10,856 --> 01:03:12,282
I know you out here.

1623
01:03:12,324 --> 01:03:14,332
Come out, don't be scared.

1624
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:16,764
Ain't no boys out here, just men.

1625
01:03:16,806 --> 01:03:18,268
Yo!

1626
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:19,763
Yo.

1627
01:03:19,805 --> 01:03:20,805
VA Capone?

1628
01:03:22,005 --> 01:03:24,005
What you doing out here?

1629
01:03:24,879 --> 01:03:27,056
Nobody fucks with Juice, man.

1630
01:03:27,098 --> 01:03:29,216
It ain't got nothing to do with you.

1631
01:03:29,258 --> 01:03:30,049
Huh?

1632
01:03:30,091 --> 01:03:31,405
It ain't got nothing to do with you.

1633
01:03:31,429 --> 01:03:32,220
It got everything to do-

1634
01:03:32,262 --> 01:03:34,095
- It ain't got nothing
to do with you, Capone.

1635
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:35,262
It got everything to do with me.

1636
01:03:35,286 --> 01:03:36,693
Stay out the way, Capone.

1637
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:38,739
It's between me and Juice.

1638
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:41,348
It's between me and Juice.

1639
01:03:41,390 --> 01:03:44,390
It ain't got nothing to do with you.

1640
01:03:45,419 --> 01:03:47,011
Stay out the way, Capone.

1641
01:03:47,053 --> 01:03:48,897
You in the motherfuckin' way.

1642
01:03:48,939 --> 01:03:50,798
Juice my little nigga.

1643
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:52,708
If anybody got a problem with him,

1644
01:03:52,750 --> 01:03:54,731
they got a problem with me.

1645
01:03:54,773 --> 01:03:55,994
Stay out the way.

1646
01:03:56,036 --> 01:03:59,216
(gunshots firing)

1647
01:03:59,258 --> 01:04:01,320
I'm in the motherfuckin' way, nigga?

1648
01:04:01,362 --> 01:04:03,728
(spitting)

1649
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:05,728
You in the motherfuckin' way, nigga.

1650
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,190
It always gonna be my way.

1651
01:04:08,232 --> 01:04:09,565
Pussy-ass bitch.

1652
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:15,008
Juice, come on, nigga, come on out man.

1653
01:04:15,050 --> 01:04:16,016
Capone?

1654
01:04:16,058 --> 01:04:17,391
Yeah, it's me.

1655
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:19,547
Come on, let's go, man.

1656
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,696
That motherfucker out here, dead.

1657
01:04:21,738 --> 01:04:22,778
Come on.

1658
01:04:22,820 --> 01:04:24,856
[Juice] Man, what the fuck?

1659
01:04:24,898 --> 01:04:27,628
Man, Capone, this shit is crazy, bruh.

1660
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:30,420
(hands slapping)

1661
01:04:31,329 --> 01:04:32,966
Let's go make some money, bruh.

1662
01:04:33,008 --> 01:04:34,447
That's what we do.

1663
01:04:34,489 --> 01:04:37,989
(hip hop music continues)

1664
01:04:42,288 --> 01:04:43,179
All right, man, I'll get up with you.

1665
01:04:43,221 --> 01:04:44,547
All right, bro.

1666
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:48,172
(hip hop music continuing)

1667
01:04:58,358 --> 01:05:01,941
(hip hop music continuing)

1668
01:05:09,616 --> 01:05:12,199
Sean, are you in any trouble?

1669
01:05:13,253 --> 01:05:15,114
[Juice] No, I'm good.

1670
01:05:15,156 --> 01:05:18,239
I'm here for you, just let me know.

1671
01:05:19,196 --> 01:05:20,962
Unc, I got everything under control.

1672
01:05:21,004 --> 01:05:22,690
If I need you, I'll call you.

1673
01:05:22,732 --> 01:05:24,399
You keep popping up.

1674
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:29,214
Sean, were you involved in any murder?

1675
01:05:29,256 --> 01:05:32,323
Nah, what made you say that?

1676
01:05:32,365 --> 01:05:35,095
The FBI had said they seen your car

1677
01:05:35,137 --> 01:05:38,470
in a place where a murder was committed.

1678
01:05:39,598 --> 01:05:42,808
Nah, not my car, it must be another car.

1679
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:44,189
Are you sure?

1680
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:47,122
Because if so, we can talk about this.

1681
01:05:47,164 --> 01:05:48,914
I'm here to help you.

1682
01:05:50,432 --> 01:05:51,632
Unc, I'm good.

1683
01:05:51,674 --> 01:05:53,734
Whatever they got on me, it ain't true.

1684
01:05:53,776 --> 01:05:55,571
Don't believe it.

1685
01:05:55,613 --> 01:05:57,292
Son, I believe you.

1686
01:05:57,334 --> 01:06:01,344
But if you are in any kind of
trouble, I'm here to help you.

1687
01:06:01,386 --> 01:06:02,803
I know, I know.

1688
01:06:04,553 --> 01:06:06,293
All right, Unc, for the thousandth time.

1689
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:09,001
I know you got me, but I
got workouts in the morning

1690
01:06:09,043 --> 01:06:10,730
and I gotta go get some rest.

1691
01:06:10,772 --> 01:06:13,939
Well, look, if you need me, call me.

1692
01:06:14,792 --> 01:06:15,871
Let me know.

1693
01:06:15,913 --> 01:06:17,738
I know, I got you.

1694
01:06:17,780 --> 01:06:22,780
(footsteps) (crickets chirping)

1695
01:06:30,107 --> 01:06:31,291
Coach Nash.

1696
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:33,872
Oh, detective Kenyatta,
how you doing, sir?

1697
01:06:33,914 --> 01:06:34,968
I'm doing great, sir.

1698
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,377
How are you?

1699
01:06:36,419 --> 01:06:37,210
I'm good.

1700
01:06:37,252 --> 01:06:39,041
I just run into your nephew the other day.

1701
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,539
He's playing for me in the big

1702
01:06:40,581 --> 01:06:42,472
Save the Street tournament this year.

1703
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:43,322
Juice is in it?

1704
01:06:43,364 --> 01:06:44,889
Oh yes sir, yes sir.

1705
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:47,122
He's the best point
guard I ever had, man.

1706
01:06:47,164 --> 01:06:50,390
I really think we gonna bring
it home this year, with him.

1707
01:06:50,432 --> 01:06:51,870
I'm looking forward to that.

1708
01:06:51,912 --> 01:06:53,890
No, I'm glad, he looks
like he doing good,

1709
01:06:53,932 --> 01:06:55,896
staying out the streets.

1710
01:06:55,938 --> 01:06:59,059
Ah, I might have to
correct you on that, sir.

1711
01:06:59,101 --> 01:07:00,218
[Coach] Oh, no.
- I'm trying to keep him

1712
01:07:00,242 --> 01:07:01,489
out of the streets.

1713
01:07:01,531 --> 01:07:05,419
But he's a good fellow and
he's going somewhere someday.

1714
01:07:05,461 --> 01:07:06,598
[Coach] Yes sir.
- I know this,

1715
01:07:06,622 --> 01:07:07,819
I know this.

1716
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:09,111
Yes sir, he is.

1717
01:07:10,531 --> 01:07:12,648
Well, hopefully, this game will help

1718
01:07:12,690 --> 01:07:13,700
keep him out the streets.

1719
01:07:13,742 --> 01:07:15,218
It's supposed to be a lot of big scouts

1720
01:07:15,242 --> 01:07:16,881
at the game this year.

1721
01:07:16,923 --> 01:07:18,860
That's good to hear, yes sir.

1722
01:07:18,902 --> 01:07:20,872
I am happy to hear that.

1723
01:07:20,914 --> 01:07:22,657
All right, well, I'm gonna run in here

1724
01:07:22,699 --> 01:07:24,569
and get my order, and
get back to the house.

1725
01:07:24,611 --> 01:07:26,082
The whole family's starving.

1726
01:07:26,124 --> 01:07:27,762
It's very good seeing you, sir.

1727
01:07:27,804 --> 01:07:29,159
Well, I'll see you later, Detective.

1728
01:07:29,183 --> 01:07:31,161
I hope to catch you at the tournament.

1729
01:07:31,203 --> 01:07:33,001
Yes sir, I plan to be there.

1730
01:07:33,043 --> 01:07:34,241
Thank you.

1731
01:07:34,283 --> 01:07:37,116
(cicadas droning)

1732
01:07:38,860 --> 01:07:41,056
(door squeaking)

1733
01:07:41,098 --> 01:07:43,656
[Juice] Watch your step.

1734
01:07:43,698 --> 01:07:45,206
Hello.

1735
01:07:45,248 --> 01:07:47,134
And where have you been?

1736
01:07:47,176 --> 01:07:49,798
[Juice] I've been out.

1737
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,709
(sighing)

1738
01:07:50,751 --> 01:07:53,237
They just showed another double homicide.

1739
01:07:53,279 --> 01:07:56,680
I be worried, that's why
I ask you these things.

1740
01:07:56,722 --> 01:07:58,704
Not to be nosy, not to pry.

1741
01:07:58,746 --> 01:08:01,959
I know you a grown man,
but I'm still your sister,

1742
01:08:02,001 --> 01:08:05,087
at the end of the day, and I worry.

1743
01:08:05,129 --> 01:08:06,589
Like I said, we all we got.

1744
01:08:06,631 --> 01:08:09,766
So when I ask you, where have you been?

1745
01:08:09,808 --> 01:08:12,058
Please don't get sarcastic.

1746
01:08:13,350 --> 01:08:15,350
I'm doing it outta love.

1747
01:08:17,251 --> 01:08:19,033
[Juice] Look, can we talk
about this another time?

1748
01:08:19,057 --> 01:08:20,599
I got things to do.

1749
01:08:20,641 --> 01:08:24,239
We did this situation for right now,

1750
01:08:24,281 --> 01:08:25,679
but we'll talk about it again.

1751
01:08:25,721 --> 01:08:26,721
Thank you.

1752
01:08:28,019 --> 01:08:29,316
Man, please don't be in
there fucking all night,

1753
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,726
makin' no babies.

1754
01:08:30,768 --> 01:08:32,816
- Thank you.
- Man, don't listen.

1755
01:08:32,858 --> 01:08:33,858
Whatever.

1756
01:08:34,734 --> 01:08:37,151
What's wrong, are you good?

1757
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,003
I'm all right.

1758
01:08:40,045 --> 01:08:41,593
You alright?

1759
01:08:41,635 --> 01:08:43,643
I think I gotta tell you something.

1760
01:08:43,685 --> 01:08:44,685
Okay.

1761
01:08:45,436 --> 01:08:48,205
What do you gotta tell me?

1762
01:08:48,247 --> 01:08:49,857
[Juice] You know Capone?

1763
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:52,364
Yeah, your sister's ex, yeah.

1764
01:08:52,406 --> 01:08:53,842
(chuckling)

1765
01:08:53,884 --> 01:08:55,642
I think he got me into something,

1766
01:08:55,684 --> 01:08:57,696
and it's gonna be hard to get out of.

1767
01:08:57,738 --> 01:08:59,336
Something, like what?

1768
01:08:59,378 --> 01:09:02,313
What are we talking about?

1769
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:05,884
I might be part of a double homicide.

1770
01:09:05,926 --> 01:09:07,405
A double homicide?

1771
01:09:07,447 --> 01:09:09,945
[Juice] Double homicide.

1772
01:09:09,987 --> 01:09:11,486
Stop playing with me.

1773
01:09:11,528 --> 01:09:13,874
I gave him a ride-

1774
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,136
Knowing how Capone is,
I just wanted to thank him.

1775
01:09:16,178 --> 01:09:17,526
He always looked out for me, so

1776
01:09:17,568 --> 01:09:20,376
I felt like I had to do the favor.

1777
01:09:20,418 --> 01:09:22,576
(sighing)

1778
01:09:22,618 --> 01:09:25,951
We go to the apartment, he run in there,

1779
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:30,097
and I think he murdered two people.

1780
01:09:30,139 --> 01:09:33,382
Juice, what about your scholarship?

1781
01:09:33,424 --> 01:09:34,354
What about us?

1782
01:09:34,396 --> 01:09:37,942
We just agreed to take our
friendship to the next level.

1783
01:09:37,984 --> 01:09:40,151
Oh my God, now, oh my God.

1784
01:09:41,258 --> 01:09:44,601
I'm an accessory to a murder
after the fact, Juice!

1785
01:09:44,643 --> 01:09:46,856
Man, we gonna be all right, just relax.

1786
01:09:46,898 --> 01:09:48,148
Relax, relax?

1787
01:09:49,606 --> 01:09:51,384
You know, I can go to jail for this.

1788
01:09:51,426 --> 01:09:53,093
Oh my God, I cannot.

1789
01:09:54,194 --> 01:09:55,194
Stacy.

1790
01:09:56,966 --> 01:09:57,966
Stacy.

1791
01:10:01,085 --> 01:10:03,441
Stacy, tell me you ain't
gonna give up on me.

1792
01:10:03,483 --> 01:10:05,525
I'm not gonna give up on us.

1793
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:08,857
(sensual music)

1794
01:10:08,899 --> 01:10:10,961
(clapping)

1795
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:14,586
(sensual music continuing)

1796
01:10:16,886 --> 01:10:18,824
So, see boy, y'know, I'm just-

1797
01:10:18,866 --> 01:10:20,714
wanted to see what's up with you,

1798
01:10:20,756 --> 01:10:22,223
and see if we can, y'know, kick it

1799
01:10:22,265 --> 01:10:25,302
outside of here sometime,
instead of, you know,

1800
01:10:25,344 --> 01:10:26,761
around everybody.

1801
01:10:29,654 --> 01:10:31,194
I'm gonna have to check my schedule,

1802
01:10:31,236 --> 01:10:33,051
see where I can fit you in at. (scoffing)

1803
01:10:33,093 --> 01:10:34,201
Oh really?

1804
01:10:34,243 --> 01:10:35,264
Yes.

1805
01:10:35,306 --> 01:10:38,100
Yeah, check your schedule.

1806
01:10:38,142 --> 01:10:39,693
- On gang.
- I want you to fit me in,

1807
01:10:39,735 --> 01:10:40,526
all right?

1808
01:10:40,568 --> 01:10:42,052
You know money come first.

1809
01:10:42,094 --> 01:10:43,704
Absolutely.

1810
01:10:43,746 --> 01:10:45,434
I got a little spot I wanna, y'know-

1811
01:10:45,476 --> 01:10:49,262
- So don't feel bad if I can't
put you in the first spot,

1812
01:10:49,304 --> 01:10:52,252
maybe I can put you in the second spot.

1813
01:10:52,294 --> 01:10:56,304
Well, I ain't trying
to be in the second spot.

1814
01:10:56,346 --> 01:10:57,891
I want to have that number one spot.

1815
01:10:57,933 --> 01:10:59,387
You gonna have to come a little closer,

1816
01:10:59,411 --> 01:11:02,157
if you want that number one spot.

1817
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:03,797
Okay.

1818
01:11:03,839 --> 01:11:05,740
What I gotta do to do that?

1819
01:11:05,782 --> 01:11:07,996
I'll let you know.

1820
01:11:08,038 --> 01:11:10,810
- You'll let me know?
- Yeah.

1821
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:11,643
Okay.

1822
01:11:11,685 --> 01:11:14,579
I'll get back right with you.

1823
01:11:14,621 --> 01:11:15,621
Damn.

1824
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:21,314
All in your guts.

1825
01:11:21,356 --> 01:11:22,844
- Really?
- Yeah.

1826
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:23,941
I may not like that shit.

1827
01:11:23,965 --> 01:11:25,906
Smoke a few blunts, if you don't like it,

1828
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,862
the money gonna make sure you like it.

1829
01:11:27,904 --> 01:11:30,587
Mm, okay, I'm down with that.

1830
01:11:30,629 --> 01:11:33,879
(hands brushing denim)

1831
01:11:35,314 --> 01:11:37,086
I'm 'bout to have to pick you up

1832
01:11:37,128 --> 01:11:38,760
and take you to the back.

1833
01:11:38,802 --> 01:11:40,359
(giggling)

1834
01:11:40,401 --> 01:11:41,721
Bend that ass over.

1835
01:11:41,763 --> 01:11:43,172
- Oh really?
- Yeah.

1836
01:11:43,214 --> 01:11:45,898
Think you can handle that?

1837
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:48,092
I ain't 'bout no talk.

1838
01:11:48,134 --> 01:11:49,480
It's gonna be more than talk,

1839
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:51,188
cause I'm gonna walk it.

1840
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:53,041
And I stand behind it.

1841
01:11:53,083 --> 01:11:55,333
Okay. Like, I stand up in-

1842
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,056
(futon creaking)

1843
01:12:00,098 --> 01:12:01,416
Damn!

1844
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:04,715
(metallic clattering) What the fuck-

1845
01:12:04,757 --> 01:12:08,217
(futon creaking) (moaning)

1846
01:12:08,259 --> 01:12:09,050
Oh, shit.

1847
01:12:09,092 --> 01:12:11,759
(door creaking)

1848
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:13,618
Get up.

1849
01:12:14,957 --> 01:12:15,957
Yeah, T-Bo.

1850
01:12:18,396 --> 01:12:20,242
Oh, Capone.

1851
01:12:20,284 --> 01:12:21,202
It's me.

1852
01:12:21,244 --> 01:12:23,884
Yeah, nigga, we go way
back, don't we, nigga?

1853
01:12:23,926 --> 01:12:26,865
Yeah, we go way back to you
ratting on me, motherfucker.

1854
01:12:26,907 --> 01:12:29,124
So I caught your motherfuckin' ass, nigga.

1855
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:31,684
I went by your mama crib,
you weren't over there.

1856
01:12:31,726 --> 01:12:32,974
I went by your sister crib,

1857
01:12:33,016 --> 01:12:36,025
look like you got some
undercover cops and shit over there.

1858
01:12:36,067 --> 01:12:38,864
They shot at me, so I shot
back at the motherfuckers.

1859
01:12:38,906 --> 01:12:42,417
Couldn't find you, so I had to get my girl

1860
01:12:42,459 --> 01:12:45,665
to set your ass the fuck up,
you know what I'm saying?

1861
01:12:45,707 --> 01:12:48,853
She one of my runners, do shit for me.

1862
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,205
So you gonna go tell the feds on me,

1863
01:12:51,247 --> 01:12:53,795
get me locked up, and let them other niggas

1864
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:55,716
go in my motherfuckin' stash?

1865
01:12:55,758 --> 01:12:57,495
We supposed to be a team.

1866
01:12:57,537 --> 01:12:59,257
Bitch ass nigga, you done fucked me up

1867
01:12:59,299 --> 01:13:01,237

01:13:01,279 --> 01:13:02,806
Shit, fuck you, nigga.

1869
01:13:02,848 --> 01:13:04,725
I'm glad I told on your bitch ass.

1870
01:13:04,767 --> 01:13:05,558
[Red] Man, you thought you was

1872
01:13:07,638 --> 01:13:08,638
Stupid.

01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:13,094
And be a fuckin' rat?

1875
01:13:13,136 --> 01:13:14,382
And rat me the fuck out, nigga?

1876
01:13:14,424 --> 01:13:18,142
Cost me two years of my
motherfuckin' life, nigga.

1877
01:13:18,184 --> 01:13:20,994
Smoke a cigarette and
go back to trapping.

1878
01:13:21,036 --> 01:13:23,211
You take your ass to sleep.

1879
01:13:23,253 --> 01:13:24,331
Sleep.

1880
01:13:24,373 --> 01:13:26,721
And this bitch ass nigga

1881
01:13:26,763 --> 01:13:28,459

You think I'm playing with you, T-Bo?

1885
01:13:34,231 --> 01:13:35,441
[T-Bo] Fuck you, Capone.

1886
01:13:35,483 --> 01:13:37,706
Nigga, you broke the
motherfuckin' code, nigga.

1887
01:13:37,748 --> 01:13:39,555
You supposed to be true to the code,

1888
01:13:39,597 --> 01:13:40,864
nigga, never snitch.

1889
01:13:40,906 --> 01:13:42,237
[T-Bo] What if I did?

1890
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:43,587
- Motherfucker, you did.
- [T-Bo] Ain't no code

1891
01:13:43,611 --> 01:13:44,858
in these streets.

1892
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,896
That nigga smoke me, you

01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:48,254
You got a fuckin' problem with me, nigga?

01:13:48,278 --> 01:13:49,917
Blow me, nigga!

1895
01:13:49,959 --> 01:13:51,789
Every man for their fuckin' self.

1896
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:54,697
You cost me two years of my
motherfuckin' life, nigga.

1897
01:13:54,739 --> 01:13:56,848
[T-Bo] Well, you still here.

1898
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:59,048
(punching)
- Motherfucker!

1899
01:13:59,090 --> 01:14:00,700
You think I'm playing with you, nigga?

1900
01:14:00,742 --> 01:14:01,869
Huh?

1901
01:14:01,911 --> 01:14:04,287
Get the fuck up, T-Bo.

01:14:04,329 --> 01:14:05,567
[T-Bo] Fuck you, Capone.

1903
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:06,400
Get up, nigga.

1904
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,647
[Red] Get up, snitchin' ass motherfucker.

1905
01:14:08,689 --> 01:14:09,859
Fuck you do, nigga?

1906
01:14:09,901 --> 01:14:11,945
You see this bullet...
You ain't no better than me.

1907
01:14:11,969 --> 01:14:13,799
[Woman] Shut the fuck up, T-Bo.

1908
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:15,105
Shut the fuck up.
- [T-Bo] Ain't no better

1909
01:14:15,129 --> 01:14:17,668

[Red] Whatever.

1910
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:19,389
[Capone] Get the fuck up, man.

1911
01:14:19,431 --> 01:14:21,999
- Fuck you, nigga.
- Get up.

1912
01:14:22,041 --> 01:14:23,470
The fuck up, nigga.

1913
01:14:23,512 --> 01:14:25,777
That ain't hurt you,
get the fuck up, nigga.

1914
01:14:25,819 --> 01:14:29,402
(hip hop music continuing)

1915
01:14:34,300 --> 01:14:36,757
(punching)

1916
01:14:36,799 --> 01:14:39,018
(gunshot firing)

1917
01:14:39,060 --> 01:14:40,815
You should've kept your mouth shut, T-Bo.

1918
01:14:40,857 --> 01:14:42,503
Let's go, Red.

1919
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,795
(grunting)

1920
01:14:47,411 --> 01:14:50,078
(sensual music)

1921
01:14:53,411 --> 01:14:56,411
(suspenseful music)

1922
01:14:57,721 --> 01:15:00,721
(crickets chirping)

1923
01:15:05,936 --> 01:15:08,218
(car door shutting)

1924
01:15:08,260 --> 01:15:12,177
(suspenseful music continuing)

1925
01:15:20,262 --> 01:15:21,420
[Capone] Yo, Juice.

1926
01:15:21,462 --> 01:15:23,554
I heard you're talking to the FBI.

1927
01:15:23,596 --> 01:15:25,553

2121
01:22:16,926 --> 01:22:19,482
'Cause they said my
cousin was with you last.

2122
01:22:19,524 --> 01:22:22,012
I'm telling you, I don't

2164
01:23:35,169 --> 01:23:36,064
[Juice] Unc-

2165
01:23:36,106 --> 01:23:37,914
- [Unc] I was right,
I have been telling y'all

2166
01:23:37,938 --> 01:23:39,385
I kinda thought something was up,

2167
01:23:39,427 --> 01:23:42,746
so that's why I decided to follow.

2168
01:23:42,788 --> 01:23:43,767
[Stacy] Juice, what happened?

2169
01:23:43,809 --> 01:23:45,314
Who were they?

2170
01:23:45,356 --> 01:23:46,442
[Juice] I don't know, he keeps saying

2171
01:23:46,466 --> 01:23:47,985

2172
01:23:48,027 --> 01:23:50,043
[Stacy] I cannot... [Unc] What about him?

2173
01:23:50,085 --> 01:23:52,237
- [Juice] I don't know.
- [Unc] Can you fill me in?

2174
01:23:52,279 --> 01:23:54,481
[Juice] I don't know, Unc.

2175
01:23:54,523 --> 01:23:58,419
[Stacy] Are you okay? (Juice spitting)

2176
01:23:58,461 --> 01:24:00,936
Juice, I can't do this anymore.

2177
01:24:00,978 --> 01:24:03,438
I'm sorry, I know I
said I'll stick with you

2178
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:07,295
through anything, but
we almost died tonight.

2179
01:24:07,337 --> 01:24:08,354
[Juice] Just gimme one more chance.

2180
01:24:08,378 --> 01:24:09,169
- One more chance.
- I can't do it,

2181
01:24:09,211 --> 01:24:10,020
I can't watch you die.

2182
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:11,062
I'm sorry, I-

2183
01:24:11,090 --> 01:24:11,904

(sobbing)

2186
01:24:16,503 --> 01:24:18,170

Man, thanks, Unc, man.

2192
01:24:30,655 --> 01:24:33,212
My bad man, you saved me again.

2193
01:24:33,254 --> 01:24:35,704
[Unc] That's what I am here for, nephew.

2194
01:24:35,746 --> 01:24:37,292
That's what I'm here for.

2195
01:24:37,334 --> 01:24:39,756
[Juice] Let's just go.

2196
01:24:39,798 --> 01:24:43,881
(reverent hip hop music playing)

2197
01:25:06,753 --> 01:25:07,753
Hey.

So we can get our shit back.

2202

(reverent hip hop music continuing)

2204
01:25:30,981 --> 01:25:32,481
Yeah, what's up?

2205
01:25:34,344 --> 01:25:36,391
So I touch down tomorrow.

2206
01:25:36,433 --> 01:25:39,088
And when I do, I'll call you.

2207

Everything is done.

You motherfuckers try to kill me?

You know who the fuck I am, nigga?

2228

Look at this shit.

2244
01:27:51,879 --> 01:27:55,296
Ghost, you know what?
- [Ghost] What's up?

2245
01:27:56,810 --> 01:27:58,909
You'll die soon, motherfucker.

2246
01:27:58,951 --> 01:28:01,951

2247
01:28:01,993 --> 01:28:03,209
[Capone] You'll die soon, bitch.

2248

01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,038
There you go.

2250
01:28:07,080 --> 01:28:09,197
Yeah, crawl for Daddy.

2251
01:28:09,239 --> 01:28:10,715
(laughing triumphantly)

2252
01:28:10,757 --> 01:28:11,840
Look at this-

2253
01:28:12,767 --> 01:28:14,499
Look at you bleeding.

2254
01:28:14,541 --> 01:28:17,291
(chuckling) I run this now.

2255
01:28:17,333 --> 01:28:19,326
Oh yeah, I took your two kilos.

2256
01:28:19,368 --> 01:28:22,730
I took them, and I'm takin'
everything else you got, too.

(chuckling)

2258
01:28:24,331 --> 01:28:26,730

(hip hop music playing)

2261
01:28:44,663 --> 01:28:45,500
Oh man. this is going to be

2262
01:28:45,542 --> 01:28:47,519
a crazy, crazy game right here.

2263
01:28:47,561 --> 01:28:50,669
Now I have to get prepared for this.

2264
01:28:50,711 --> 01:28:52,239
Who's gonna help me?

2265
01:28:52,281 --> 01:28:53,539
And I'm the referee of this,

2266
01:28:53,581 --> 01:28:55,567
and I gotta deal with young thugs.

2267
01:28:55,609 --> 01:28:57,519
I'm all for the community.

2268
01:28:57,561 --> 01:28:59,989
Come on man, I'm an activist.

2269
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:01,911
(sighing)

2270
01:29:01,953 --> 01:29:04,953
If it ain't one thing, it's another.

2271
01:29:06,099 --> 01:29:09,182
Now, they want me to throw the game.

2272
01:29:11,082 --> 01:29:13,799
With all seriousness,
I don't want to do this.

2273
01:29:13,841 --> 01:29:15,108
It's not worth it.

2274
01:29:15,150 --> 01:29:16,690
It's not my challenge.

2275
01:29:16,732 --> 01:29:18,815
It's not what I live for.

2276
01:29:19,827 --> 01:29:21,160
For God's sakes!

2277
01:29:23,573 --> 01:29:27,156
(electronic hip hop music)

2278
01:29:32,072 --> 01:29:34,172
Here, for the Save our Streets campaign,

2279
01:29:34,214 --> 01:29:36,979
with $50,000 on the line.

2280
01:29:37,021 --> 01:29:38,912
That's right, $50,000.

2281
01:29:38,954 --> 01:29:40,801
25 will either go to the north,

2282
01:29:40,843 --> 01:29:42,630
or the 25 could go to the south.

2283
01:29:42,672 --> 01:29:44,682
But we can guarantee you the other 25

2284
01:29:44,724 --> 01:29:47,179
is going of the respectable
community outreach programs

2285
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:49,797
that that they are trying to do.

2286
01:29:49,839 --> 01:29:50,728
Bread on ya'll.

2287
01:29:50,770 --> 01:29:52,276
There you go.

2288
01:29:52,318 --> 01:29:53,893
All right, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout.

2289
01:29:53,917 --> 01:29:55,167
- There we go.
- Yes sir.

2290
01:29:55,209 --> 01:29:56,182
Oh!

2291
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,015
(hoop rattling)

2292
01:29:57,057 --> 01:29:57,848
All right! That's what-

2293
01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:59,984
- Okay, bring it in guys, bring it in.

2294
01:30:00,026 --> 01:30:02,954
All right, y'all looking
good out there, real good.

2295
01:30:02,996 --> 01:30:05,604
All right, now, we got
$50,000 riding on this game.

2296
01:30:05,646 --> 01:30:07,844
50 percent of that goes to the city.

2297
01:30:07,886 --> 01:30:11,554
We get to split the rest of
it to do whatever we want.

2298
01:30:11,596 --> 01:30:13,409
(murmuring)

2299
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:16,215
[Coach] Hopefully, well,
they beat us every year, so-

2300
01:30:16,257 --> 01:30:17,457
Hopefully this year we got it.

2301
01:30:17,496 --> 01:30:19,407
We got a good squad.

2302
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:20,940
Got one supposed to be
coming, he might be a little late.

2303
01:30:20,964 --> 01:30:23,916
- We need him.
- Where's he at?

2304
01:30:23,958 --> 01:30:25,403
Where's he at?

2305
01:30:25,445 --> 01:30:26,685

He played for me in high
school and everything.

I don't mind you psyching yourself up, but-
