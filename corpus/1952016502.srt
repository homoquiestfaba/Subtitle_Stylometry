00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,936
Fifhteen years ago in Tromaville,

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,937
New Jersey, the Toxic Chemical
Capital of the world

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,103
little mop boy Melvin Fyrd,
a 98-pound weakling

4
00:00:11,166 --> 00:00:15,103
was teased taunted, and other bad stuff,

5
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:20,137
until he fell into a barrel of
toxic chemical waste.

6
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:25,338
Transforming him into a hideously
deformed creature

7
00:00:25,399 --> 00:00:28,870
of superhuman size and strength;

8
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:35,839
Melvin became The Toxic Avenger,
the first superhero from New Jersey!

9
00:00:35,899 --> 00:00:41,005
Then two really shitty sequels were made...
sorry about that.

10
00:00:41,066 --> 00:00:44,569
This is the real sequel.

11
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:26,074
Okay kids, today we're going to celebrate
our special friends below the border.

12
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:31,505
We are going to celebrate take
a Mexican to Lunch Day.

13
00:01:31,566 --> 00:01:34,235
Can we say that?
Mexican.

14
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,335
Very, very good.

15
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,336
Now that's where the hard working
Mexicans take naps during the day.

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,104
Just like us?

17
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:54,204
Just like us. Exactly like us.

18
00:01:54,266 --> 00:02:01,640
Tito, v_hat do you think you're doing young

19
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,135
Listen bitch, iust because l'm a tard

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:09,138
doesn't mean that you have to treat
me like one.

21
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:18,806
But because l'm ''special,'' l don't
think l'm ever gonna get laid,

22
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:23,437
so why can't l masturbate?

23
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,540
Tito! Okay kids, now do you know
what you're eating?

24
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:37,605
That's right tacos. Can you say taco?

25
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:43,138
Taco.

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:03:01,441
All right you fucking retards drop your

27
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,935
Fuck this man, l'm outta here.

28
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:29,036
What on earth do you think you're doing,
young man?

29
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:32,036
l'm trying to teach a class here.

30
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:35,036
What kind of man are you?

31
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:36,468
This kind.

34
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:53,336
Well folks it looks like we've got
another

35
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,335
You take this one.
l did the last three.

36
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:04,171
The terrorist group in question,
the Diaper Mafia,

37
00:04:04,233 --> 00:04:08,337
have taken the Tromaville School
for the

38
00:04:08,633 --> 00:04:14,805
We're going to go live now to the
Tromaville School for the Very Special

39
00:04:14,866 --> 00:04:18,336
where our correspondent Cindy Tata
is

40
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:22,336
Tromaville police chief Newman
about this very subject.

41
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,936
Stick with us aRer the break where
our very own Josh Levitsky

42
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:29,936
will share some of those mouth-watering
recipes for butternut squash.

43
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,569
Oooh, aaah, l like that
That's good

44
00:04:32,633 --> 00:04:36,069
Like a living Martha Stewart
But isn't she still alive?

45
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,968
Nigga, please.

46
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:40,801
Chief Newman, what caused the
Diaper Mafia

47
00:04:40,899 --> 00:04:42,801
horrible acts of violence?

48
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:44,468
Well, uh, ah, no comment.

49
00:04:44,533 --> 00:04:47,102
l can't believe this is happening in

50
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:50,769
You ask me, these diaper mafia punks
ale

51
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:56,305
What is the use of sending these
retards to school in the first place?

52
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,836
All right, Tex, time to
kill another one.

53
00:05:01,899 --> 00:05:03,368
Yes, daddy.

54
00:05:03,433 --> 00:05:05,935
Chief Newman, the Diaper Mafia has said
they will execute

55
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:09,936
a special student every half hour
until their demands have been met.

56
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,601
Really?

57
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,668
Yet it's been at least 35 minutes since

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,601
never mind

59
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:20,268
Well, that's a damn shame it had
to happen on

60
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,268
Take Mexicans to Lunch Day and all.

61
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:27,069
You hear that, pigs, you hear that?
You

62
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,634
You hear that hear that hear that?

63
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:34,338
A tard dies every five minutes unless
the

64
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,133
You got that?!

65
00:05:36,366 --> 00:05:37,433
Got that got that?

66
00:05:37,933 --> 00:05:40,435
l'm working on it, really
l'm working on it.

67
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,435
Please don't shoot any more
of those tards.

68
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,935
l mean those special kids.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,572
Fuck the fucking tards! l'm sick and
tired of their drooling and whining!

70
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:58,771
Now why is it when l shit my pants,
it's a fucking social faux pas?

71
00:05:58,866 --> 00:06:01,401
But when a tard shits his pants,

72
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,203
a good-looking nurse wipes his ass
for him, huh?

73
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,567
She's got her head up her ass.

74
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:13,238
Tex, Tex, Tex check it out! Pregger
pi-ata! HA HA HA!!

75
00:06:19,866 --> 00:06:21,934
Hey hey, you've got your head
up your ass!

76
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,634
Fuck you!

77
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,567
Fuckin people!

78
00:06:24,766 --> 00:06:29,070
That's what separates us from the
pussies like the Trenchcoat Mafia,

79
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,070
the Flat Top Mafia, and
the No-Pants Mafia.

80
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,802
Didn't you hear what Kazinski said?
Fucking tard.

81
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:41,804
Gun!
Nooooo!

82
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:06,936
Mayor Goldberg, how do you feel about
the

83
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,834
Try not to harp about the five
that are dead.

84
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:14,605
Think about the hundreds of students
that are still living, still breathing,

85
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,501
and let's pray for an end to all
this murder and mayhem and garbage.

86
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:20,368
Let's pray.
Let's pray.

87
00:07:21,766 --> 00:07:25,536
Get off the phone!

88
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,268
Let's pray, godammit!

89
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,567
You too.

90
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:32,003
Oh lord, in your divine wisdom,
please find it in your heart

91
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,002
to put an end to this murder
and filth and trash and garbage.

92
00:07:35,066 --> 00:07:37,168
Oh, and please help us to get
re-elected one more time ok?

93
00:07:37,366 --> 00:07:39,301
Thank you very much God, and amen.

94
00:07:39,366 --> 00:07:41,167
Amen.

95
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,202
Dye-a-nu

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,334
Thank God you're here.
What took you so

97
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,802
l had to change. It takes a while.

98
00:07:52,866 --> 00:07:55,868
Yeah, ok. All right, kid, hold on,
all

99
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,802
l got the Really Real Bikini TV crew here.

100
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:07,736
The Diaper Mafia's demands have not yet
been issued, and yet,

101
00:08:07,966 --> 00:08:11,736
speculation has already begun as to the
motivation behind the senseless attack

102
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,602
on the mentally feeble student body.

103
00:08:15,666 --> 00:08:17,067
What do you think, Nick?

104
00:08:17,133 --> 00:08:20,035
l'm gonna have to go with heavy
metal music on this one, Jason.

105
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,968
Aah, interesting.

106
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,969
But what about that best-selling
video game Kill All the Retards?

107
00:08:26,033 --> 00:08:28,902
Could be a factor, Jason

108
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:31,535
But we cannot forget about
the rap music.

109
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,470
Very popular with the kids. l
personally, am not a fan of rap music.

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:38,469
l think you could put a c in front
of rap and call it you-know-what.

111
00:08:38,533 --> 00:08:39,867
l don't think you should go that far.

112
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:40,300
Not a fan.

113
00:08:40,366 --> 00:08:41,633
l think you're going too far.

114
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,033
Not a fan.

115
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,068
All right, l think you've
established that.

116
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:48,570
You know l think the worst part is that
we'll never know

117
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:54,438
Well that won't stop me from casting my

118
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,169
_ll, it certainly couldn't be violence in the ne;r_J

119
00:08:57,233 --> 00:08:57,633
Oh God no.

120
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,869
l mean we may broadcast death and
tragedy,

121
00:09:01,066 --> 00:09:03,334
in his heart, and l think you'll
back me up on this

122
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:03,533
l will back you up.

123
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,337
We would never glorify it.

124
00:09:13,566 --> 00:09:16,135
You like that, don't you retard?

125
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:23,470
Hello, Tex, Samantha Chambers,
Really Real Bikini TV.

126
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,334
This is my morbidly obese sidekick.

127
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,535
l mean, cameraman, Joe.

128
00:09:30,366 --> 00:09:33,535
Well Samantha, looks like l won't
have to frisk you for weapons.

129
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,769
Hey, listen lady, l didn't call you
in here to fuck you.

130
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,768
l called you in here because the
Really Real Bikini TV show is

131
00:09:46,066 --> 00:09:47,767
the number one show in America.

132
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,202
Now tell fatty there to turn
on the camera.

133
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,035
l'm gonna show ya something.
Okay.

134
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,135
You see this bitch right here?

135
00:09:56,733 --> 00:10:01,671
Wasting perfectly good tax dollars
trying to ''teach'' the un-teachable.

136
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:05,736
And if there's one thing the Diaper
Mafia hates more than RETARDS,

137
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:07,734
it's genetic traitors.

138
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:15,504
Now, l'm gonna show you what we do
to bitches like that.

139
00:11:00,033 --> 00:11:02,301
_ger, 01 =1 1 =04=21 , 01 =1 1 =08=25,Tromaville's
of superhuman size and strength.

lf that's the Toxic Avenger,
where's his

141
00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:37,135
ward and sidekick Fatass?

142

lt's Lardass, punk!

143
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:47,167
Let's fight.

144
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,870
Toxie's got his head up his ass.

145
00:12:18,933 --> 00:12:21,168
l've got my head up my ass.

146
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,635
Children, duck! Duck! No no no no!

147
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,267
Toxie!

148
00:13:36,966 --> 00:13:39,601
No. You can't kill me Toxie.

149
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:43,169
You see this exploding timing device
on my chest?

150
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,368
You see that bomb over there
in the corner?

151
00:13:45,433 --> 00:13:47,635
Kiss your school goodbye.

152
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,268
Oh my God!

153
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:53,203
Five seconds aRer my heart stops
this school is nothin'

154
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:55,201
but dead tards and charred lard.

155
00:13:55,266 --> 00:13:56,333
Hey!

156
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,736
That's right! Kazinski said you'd
be here. Oh that's right!

157
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:03,870
__ ___ ___,
__g_G fl ___m_

158
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,868
in the first place anyway, huh?

159
00:14:06,933 --> 00:14:10,903
He understands this world is full of
unthinking cattle that need to be

160
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:13,902
led into the new millennium
with a new order.

161
00:14:13,966 --> 00:14:18,036
And the first step in the process is to

162
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:21,936
genetically mutated freaks and shit!
Ha-ha-heh-heh.

163
00:14:23,066 --> 00:14:25,435
That' wasn't a nice thing to say.

164
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,603
Excuse me, miss Wiener

165
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:28,666
Toxie, you were always my best student

166
00:14:31,866 --> 00:14:32,633
Thanks!

167
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,569
No Toxie! Don't let your Tromatons
control

168
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:38,734
Tromatons?

169
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:02,070
Think Toxie, if his heart stops
the bomb'll go off!

170
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:03,767
Aaaaagh! put it back in! Aaaaaaagh!

171
00:15:15,866 --> 00:15:18,101
Ugh, there you go, good as new! Oh darn it.

172
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:26,701
Oh darn it.

173
00:15:26,766 --> 00:15:28,868
Come on Toxie let's get these kids
out of

174
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,368
This building's about to explode!

175
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:36,705
This bomb is now armed.
Detonation in T

176
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,567
This would be easier if l had a mop.

177
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:52,468
minus 5 seconds.

178
00:15:58,766 --> 00:16:02,669
These drugs are gonna blow my ass off

179
00:16:02,966 --> 00:16:03,800
Whoa. What the?

180
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:08,602
Didn't your special helper tell you
that drugs are bad for you?

181
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,967
Fuck off super zero!

182
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,235
l'm iust trying to act like
all the other cool cats my age.

183
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:18,667
Ahh! What's the deal Tox?

184
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:22,937
Well the deal is, l iust can't standby
and

185
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,035
l'm not killin' myself
drugs kill my pain.

186
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,037
Being a teenager sucks.

187
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,733
Um, well

188
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:37,105
Being a retarded teenager sucks worse.
Drugs make it suck less.

189
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:41,537
You're pretty articulate for a
druggie special student.

190
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,635
What's articulatit?

191
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:49,572
Ahhh! Ummm! Come on!

192
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:13,503
No Toxie! Church and state must
remain separated!

193
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,737
Holy cow! Lardass, l have to go
impregnate

194
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:30,637
Action sausage nunchuks
Deli style!

195
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,968
T minus 3 seconds.

196
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:48,736
Oh Toxie hurry! Do you feel
what time it is?

197
00:17:51,333 --> 00:18:16,891
Oh yeah, yeah, YEAH!
Ugh. Ooooh. Ungh.

198
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:26,409
Oh Toxie, in my blind eyes you are
the most beautiful man in the world.

199
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,235
l can't believe it's not butter!

200
00:18:44,599 --> 00:18:48,670
You know Sarah, l have a good feeling
about the sex we had just now

201
00:18:48,866 --> 00:18:51,969
l really think l got you pregnant.
Oh! What time is it?

202
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,601
Oh! Melvin what's gotten into you?

203
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:59,636
l know you're really excited about

204
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,768
the results of the pregnancy test
aren't you?

205
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,968
Umm yeah that's it Sarah

206
00:19:05,033 --> 00:19:10,705
No Sarah l gotta get back to the school,
the special kids are in trouble

207
00:19:10,766 --> 00:19:13,768
What am l to you anymore Melvin?
l feel like a giant ovary

208
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:17,769
with a hundred and ten pounds
of flesh attached. God!

209
00:19:21,466 --> 00:19:22,433
Sarah, what are you saying?

210
00:19:22,633 --> 00:19:23,734
That's not what it is at all.
l love you.

211
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:27,136
Well l iust can't seem to understand
why Lardass can't do some of the

212
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,134
''_,;:I'__.:._'I',,I'i',.__II''__',',___# :,'_:'',',':'':_.,__''.,:,,',I_'__,

213
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,270
l know l know Lardass is all grown up
now, but when l made him my ward

214
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,269
all those years ago,
l promised him we'd be partners.

215
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,468
l know he's a big boy now
a really,

216
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,437
really big boy now but he's iust
not to defend Tromaville on his own.

217
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:52,571
You go to your Lardass! Maybe he'll have

218
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:56,670
l love you Sarah.
Yeah.

219
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,802
Toxie's here!

220
00:20:07,733 --> 00:20:11,903
Sgt. Kabukiman N.Y.P.D why aren't
you in there helping the Toxic Avenger?

221
00:20:11,966 --> 00:20:15,102
l'm a New York City police officer
this is not my jurisdiction

222
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,269
besides Toxie suggested l stay out here
and stake out the area.

223
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,767
Yeah because l can guard everyone

224
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:21,767
out here with my amazing
oriental super powers

225
00:20:21,966 --> 00:20:25,269
and so everyone should be safe outside
with me here behind this fence.

226
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:28,502
l think you should actually come
in here

227
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,968
T minus 2 seconds.

228
00:20:37,833 --> 00:20:41,403
Toxie, Toxie!
The bomb is about to go off!

229
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:44,335
T minus 1 second.

230
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,868
Thank heavens for my emergency
peanut

231
00:20:48,766 --> 00:20:49,733
Come on kids.

232
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,402
Let's go, we have no time to waste!
We've got to evacuate the building.

233
00:20:53,633 --> 00:20:54,767
You're dead. You? You're dead.

234
00:20:55,133 --> 00:20:59,370
Let's get out of here!
Come on, let's go, move it!

235
00:21:03,766 --> 00:21:06,368
T minus O seconds,
the bomb will now blow

236
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,701
Thank you for shopping at Kmart.

237
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,767
Lardass, what are you doing?
We've got to get out of here!

238
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,267
No Melvin, there's no time!

239
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,270
There are too many people in the
building, we'll never get them out.

240
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,236
Lardass, no! Don't eat the bomb

241
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,602
Lardass, NO!

242
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:26,803
Even your superhuman stomach
can't contain it! Noooo!

243
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:10,968
What have l done?

244
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:15,068
lt's ok, Toxie, sweetie loves you

245
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,301
Speak for yourself, biotch.
Fuck this man,

246
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:21,236
l'm outta here. Get outta my way pussies.

247
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:27,038
Oh Lardass!
My friend.

248
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:39,837
Alright men, ready, aim,

249
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,634
make guns go bang.

250
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:57,402
Alright men, move aRer him
and use extreme caution.

251
00:22:57,666 --> 00:23:00,068
That lumpy headed bastard is dangerous.

252
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,534
Get in the car!!

253
00:23:13,766 --> 00:23:17,503
Oh? Ok. l suppose l owe you a thanks.

254
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:21,970
Don't mention it boss,
l'm just glad l decided to stick around.

255
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:27,571
You iust can't trust school
kids these days.

256
00:23:28,433 --> 00:23:29,333
Crack deal?

257
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,935
Crack deal? Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD
what are you talking about?

258
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,602
Sgt? NYPD? What?

259
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,967
Huh?

260
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:37,567
What's wrong with you, Noxie?

261
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:39,967
Are you selling the crack or
are you smoking it?

262
00:23:40,033 --> 00:23:40,733
Huh?

263
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,101
Shit! Hang on Noxie!

264
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,434
Noxie?

265
00:23:51,633 --> 00:23:53,768
Did you see that? That was a stop sign!

266
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:55,666
Oh!

267
00:23:59,599 --> 00:23:59,666
Lookout!

268
00:24:04,633 --> 00:24:05,533
What are

269
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,234
Those are police!

270
00:24:08,299 --> 00:24:08,299
What's wrong with you Noxie?

271
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:12,503
You'd think you've never been
chased by the cops before.

272
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,934
l haven't.

273
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:02,935
Everybody back, everybody back,
just relax, stay calm.

274
00:25:04,133 --> 00:25:07,102
Toxie you alright?
What happened in there?

275
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:14,070
Hey medics, get over here,
get Toxie over to the emergency ward.

276
00:25:15,866 --> 00:25:17,567
You alright?

277
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,668
Come here!

278
00:25:38,033 --> 00:25:43,571
Stay back everybody! He's armed.

279
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,101
What the hell did you do to the chief?

280
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:51,702
Wow! Go Toxie!

281
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,434
Toxie, what could've prompted this

282
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,167
vicious attack on the citizens of Tromaville'

283
00:25:56,233 --> 00:25:59,269
No fucking comment.

284
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:04,134
Here how bout some hand me downs.

285
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,301
YES!

286
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:10,667
Any final statement?

287
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:12,867
Shut your fucking cake hole!

288
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:26,267
This doesn't look good.

289
00:26:26,333 --> 00:26:28,068
No it doesn't fuckin' look good.

290
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:36,367
We should do something

291
00:26:36,433 --> 00:26:40,470
Do something like what? Did you see
what he just did to the fuckin' chief?

292
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,568
Fuck that, l'm leavin'. Are you comin'?

293
00:26:51,566 --> 00:26:52,333
Yeah, ok.

294
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,868
Faggot #1 meet faggot #2. Bingo!

295
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,802
Say it ain't so Toxie, say it ain't so.

296
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:10,303
lt is so. Hold this fat ass. Oopsie daisy!

297
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,303
Coming up at 1 1 =OO, Toxie kills
virtually everyone in Tromaville.

298
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:27,470
And our very own Josh Levinsky
gets jiggy with it.

299
00:28:11,266 --> 00:28:14,736
Hang on Noxie, l can't pass this up.

300
00:28:18,266 --> 00:28:20,735
Kabukiman! That was an illegal U turn!

301
00:28:31,766 --> 00:28:34,235
Old Lady dead ahead!

302
00:29:12,366 --> 00:29:13,500
This is an American made car.

303
00:29:14,033 --> 00:29:16,668
Every time they flip 25 feet in the air
and crash down,

304
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:19,568
they blow up! Let's get out of here.

305
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,669
God damn.
Oh Toxie!

306
00:29:33,733 --> 00:29:36,001
Toxie, the children picked these for you.

307
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,334
Ah, go fuck yourself.
Toxie!

308
00:29:40,866 --> 00:29:42,334
What the hell is going on here?

309
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:47,337
What is going on indeed.
The events, which you are witnessing,

310
00:29:48,866 --> 00:29:52,502
have proven my theories regarding
the truly fragile nature

311
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:55,500
of the space-time continuum.

312
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:56,500
Nurse.

313
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,167
Blackboard

314
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,167
Perfect.

315
00:30:12,366 --> 00:30:16,002
As you can plainly see,
for every dimension,

316
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:19,169
there exists a diametric opposite of
that dimension. When two explosions

317
00:30:21,366 --> 00:30:24,335
of equal mass occurred simultaneously,

318
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,170
the barrier between Tromaville, and
it's dimensional doppelganger,

319
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,170
Amortville, was weakened for a moment.
This breach caused the Toxic Avenger,

320
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:42,337
and his evil opposite the Noxious
Offender to enter each other's reality.

321
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:50,339
Well, that's pretty good for a shriveled
up cripple, who can't get it up.

322
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:55,171
That is it hell-bitch. l don't need to
take this shit from you.

323
00:30:56,366 --> 00:31:00,103
My erectile dysfunction has been
resolved see. Thanks to the modern

324
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,936
miracle of penile implant it merely
takes a few squeezes of my scrotal

l'll show you shriveled.

327
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,935
Unzip me, and you'll be happy to launch

328
00:31:29,299 --> 00:31:35,105
l die, but my insane theories live on.

329
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:47,101
_ey Noxie! Where ya been? Long time no see

330
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,602
Hey Noxie, want some of this?

331
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:55,103
Ah No thank you.
Thanks for the offer but no.

332
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,534
What is this evil, evil place?

333
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:54,873
Toxie! Nice work at the school my friend.
You need a ride some place?

334
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:01,470
Grandma, grandma, grandma, grandma,
grandma, grandma, grandma

335
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:08,305
How am l supposed to smoke this crack
without a fucking pipe?

336
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,469
Fuck off Spazmo, that's the deal.

337
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:17,637
But, but, but, the deal was the three
of you guys for a rock and a stem.

338
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:21,470
Look, look, look, you got your crack
right, right? Now, go smoke your shit,

339
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,635
and get out of here.
We'll try not to fuck her up

340
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:27,804
too bad for you, okay?
Bu but but, that wasn't the deal

341
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,803
That's it. Now l'm going to have
to freak you.

342
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,468
Stop that right now.

343
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:41,970
Hey, hey Noxie. What's going on man?
You wanna help us beat up the retarded

344
00:33:42,033 --> 00:33:45,636
guy?
Or you, hey you wanna help us rape her?

345
00:33:46,833 --> 00:33:47,967
Yeah, yeah.

346
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:52,636
Didn't you learn your lesson last time
l Disemboweled you, shoved your head

347
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:55,302
up your ass, and killed you
with your own diaper?

348
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,967
What? What? Huh?

349
00:33:57,099 --> 00:33:57,900
Guess not.

350
00:34:42,933 --> 00:34:44,567
Sweetie, are you okay?

351
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:47,902
The bad boys were trying to touch me.
Bad boys, bad boys.

352
00:34:47,966 --> 00:34:51,903
They're gone now, everything is okay.
Keep calm you sweetie and honey.

353
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:53,568
What's your name little girl?

354
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:55,900
Sweetie Honey.

355
00:34:57,766 --> 00:35:01,169
Uh, okay. Do you know where you live?
We gotta get you home.

356
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:06,003
l tried but, my home was gone. 1 122
Maplegrove Rd. Tromaville, New Jersey.

357
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:09,001
Just like Grandma said,
and it was gone.

358
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:14,167
And you? What the heck were you doing?

359
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:18,335
Looking for a crack pipe.
What did it look like l was doing?

360
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:22,002
lt looked like you were selling
Sweetie Honey for drugs!

361
00:35:22,366 --> 00:35:24,334
And it looks like l saved you
from a severe beating.

362
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:27,168
What are you doing here,
and where is your home?

363
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:33,171
Man, l don't have a home. l am a loner.
And Sweetie's house is gone,

364
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,000
iust like she said.

365
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,001
That is ridiculous.
Come on, Sweetie Honey.

366
00:35:46,366 --> 00:35:48,668
See kids, here's the dump, right where
l said it would be.

367
00:35:48,766 --> 00:35:49,833
Now we'll go in my shack
and call your parents.

368
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,168
Parents? No parents, mom and dad died
and then Auntie Em took me in,

369
00:35:53,366 --> 00:35:57,503
but Auntie Em hit me too much so then
nice lady took me to grandma.

370
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,435
Well, we'll call whoever, and Sarah
will make you some lunch, and

371
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,434
Where's my shack? It was right here.

372
00:36:09,633 --> 00:36:10,600
See? l told you.

373
00:36:12,966 --> 00:36:15,601
l don't think we're in Tromaville
anymore Toto.

374
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,601
Tito, my name is Tito.

375
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:18,933
Whatever.

376
00:36:19,466 --> 00:36:22,101
What are you going to do now,
Mr. Kingshit?

377
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,435
l don't know. l really don't know.

378
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,435
l'm hungry. You said that l was
going to have lunch.

379
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:29,700
l'm really really hungry.

380
00:36:29,766 --> 00:36:31,601
You want lunch too?

381
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,104
No, see l am a iunkie, so l

382
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:38,268

383
00:36:38,466 --> 00:36:39,934
Here you go kids, something to eat
and drink.

384
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,936
Eww, gross. This whiskey tastes
like pregnant lady's piss.

385
00:36:50,466 --> 00:36:51,767
What kind of sandwich is this?

386
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,703
Congratulations Sorry you're pregnant.
You know, l don't know why on

387
00:36:58,766 --> 00:37:00,701
the commercials, they say these
pregnancy tests are hard to read,

388
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:04,703

Yeah, it's a lot safer here.

So iust stay here and l'll be back for
you just as soon as l can, okay? Bye.

Stay here, stay here, stay here.

00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:54,867
l'm out of here.

410
00:37:54,933 --> 00:37:56,200
No! Tito, you can't go. Toxie said

411
00:37:56,266 --> 00:38:00,370
and you're over there and we have
to stay here. Tito, no,

Tito come back! Come back!

418
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,633
Okay, Okay.

419
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,635
Okay. You are giving me
a stomachache in my brain.

420
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:37,802
lf you don't want to be a lonesome
you have to come with me

421
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,135
but l am in charge
l make choices out here.

422
00:38:40,666 --> 00:38:41,299
Kay.

423
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,467
Let's go. l am in charge.

424
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:47,966
Thanks Tito. Will you hold my hand.
No.

425
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,134
That's okay. Please hold my hand.

426
00:38:57,166 --> 00:39:01,136
You know Toxie l used to think that
you were one of those namby pamby

427
00:39:01,199 --> 00:39:06,071
pussy-footin' mother fuckers.
You know one of those bleeding heart

428
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,802
heroes that's always makin'
my job difficult.

429
00:39:08,866 --> 00:39:12,169
But you're actually a bad guy.
You're all right.

430
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:14,233
Thanks.

431
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:19,903
Uh oh. You better split Toxie.
This press conference is about you.

432
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:22,067
l'll hang around and
see what the deal is,

433
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,502
then we'll meet at your house later.
Go on.

434
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:26,733
My place?
Go go go.

435
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:30,735
Oh lick my balls. Mother fucker.
Jesus Fucking H. Christ. Fuck.

436
00:39:33,266 --> 00:39:35,401
l never trusted Toxie!
Yeah!

437
00:39:36,099 --> 00:39:38,569
l knew he was bad from day one!
Yeah!

438
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:43,769
That's my husband you're talking about.
He loves you people!

439
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:48,903
Bullshit! We all loved Chief Newman.
Face it! Toxie's gone mad!

440
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:50,066
Yeah!

441
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:53,633
Wait! Wait Everybody!

442
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:58,737
Toxie saved me and my unborn child
from the bomb. Toxie's a hero!

443
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:01,734
Hero's don't double amputate
police chiefs

444
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,904
and hurl twelve-year-old children
into brick walls!

445
00:40:07,099 --> 00:40:07,733
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

446
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:13,570
Please. Please. Quiet down folks.
Let's get down to the Lord's work.

447
00:40:14,766 --> 00:40:18,603
We all saw the Toxic Avenger kill,
not only our beloved police chief,

448
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,234
but innocent bystanders as well.

449
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:24,402
So, we've got to bring him in.
For questioning!

450
00:40:24,933 --> 00:40:26,567
Not shot by some
vigilante citizens group.

451
00:40:32,266 --> 00:40:32,899
Fear not citizens!

452
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,902
l have assembled the only team capable
of bringing him in.

453
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:42,236
Super Heroes, united one and all,
to protect Tromaville.

454
00:40:42,766 --> 00:40:44,734
And l thank God for it.

455
00:40:46,266 --> 00:40:46,899
Now to introduce them

456
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:51,569
first, please put your hands together
and give the clap to The Vibrator.

457
00:40:57,266 --> 00:41:00,502
Hhhhhhhhi!

458
00:41:03,366 --> 00:41:03,833
Yeah!

459
00:41:04,533 --> 00:41:06,434
Our next superhero protects creatures
of the ocean.

460
00:41:06,533 --> 00:41:10,336
Please give a warm Tromaville
welcome to Dolphin Man!

461
00:41:23,033 --> 00:41:26,002
Unfortunately, there's not much water
here so Dolphin Man is pretty useless.

462
00:41:27,366 --> 00:41:30,335
But, we have somebody stronger,
more powerful, much better looking.

463
00:41:32,199 --> 00:41:35,169
Who are they going to bring out next?
A cow that walks upright?

464
00:41:35,866 --> 00:41:37,167
Please welcome Mad Cowboy!

465
00:41:43,933 --> 00:41:44,667
Jesus Christ!

466
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:47,667
Now, when rock super star
Mastur G

467
00:41:48,199 --> 00:41:49,501
and mild mannered
sex offender John Bator

468
00:41:50,699 --> 00:41:52,501
went into the same faulty elevator

469
00:41:53,366 --> 00:41:55,501
little did they realize that they would
emerge as one man

470
00:41:56,199 --> 00:41:57,167
a man that could fight crime with

471
00:41:57,966 --> 00:41:59,434
shear repulsion and bad rhyming.

472
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,436
Please give a warm welcome to combined
Mastur G and John Bator

473
00:42:05,966 --> 00:42:06,766
Masturbator!

474
00:42:09,466 --> 00:42:11,768
Yeah, yeah, yeah. l'm the masturbator,
the freaky palm god.

Here it comes, here it comes,

476
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,269
it's comin' up Tromaville.
Yeah, ooh, ooh hoo. Here l go, yeah.

477
00:42:34,466 --> 00:42:36,935
And now, last but not least,
the man to beat the man,

478
00:42:37,966 --> 00:42:38,933
the crflme de la crflme

479
00:42:39,466 --> 00:42:43,436
the greatest superhero of all
please welcome Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD

480
00:42:55,966 --> 00:42:57,534
Thank you mayor.
Thank you very much sir. Thank you.

481
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:00,869
l iust want to assure every citizen
of Tromaville that

482
00:43:02,233 --> 00:43:06,203
_,,_._,_, , ',,_# ,, ','.: :_:I'';_,I _' ' _,' ,, :,_,I '_ :I", :,',_ __,I ':: _,: _

483
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:11,533
What a dumbass.

484
00:43:12,566 --> 00:43:14,868
Why, l could take him out with
my heat seeking chopsticks,

485
00:43:20,066 --> 00:43:22,201
or, or l could suffocate him with my
computerized 16 bite sushi,

486
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:30,368
or burn him, burn him with my
pyro projectile parasols.

487
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,702
l have many more to take him out, but
l don't think that will be necessary,

488
00:43:37,566 --> 00:43:39,200
Toxie will come in on his own.
He was just having a bad day.

489
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,535
We all have bad days! You know,
maybe we don't go around ripping

490
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,869
off the arms of the police chief, and
bash priests and cops in the heads with

491
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:54,900
Thank you!

492
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,802
He's probably bi-polar. Abraham
Lincoln was bi-polar and what did he do?

493
00:44:00,333 --> 00:44:01,467
He freed the slaves.

494
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,300
So you see, if we iust sit back, relax,

495
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:06,302
everything will come to a
peaceful Kabuki conclusion.

496
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:14,803
Thank you Kabukiman well as you can see
Tromaville is in very capable hands.

497
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:18,300
This concludes our press conference.

Even a simple crack whore like me,
working her way through art school,

504
00:44:34,666 --> 00:44:36,300
can appreciate the finer aspects of you.

505
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:38,634
Where is my house?

506
00:44:40,833 --> 00:44:42,134

573
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:49,136

Hey, buddy

for an out of work particle physicist?

577
00:50:11,666 --> 00:50:12,299
Lardass?

578
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:13,800
Lardass!

579
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:15,633
Fuck you, Mr. Lumpyhead!

580
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,801
l can't believe you're alive!
l thought you were dead.

581
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,302
First of all, my name's not Lardass,

582
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,468
it's Chester.
l resent the implication.

583
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:27,302
Secondly, l wish l was dead.
Huh?

584
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,702
l was a scientist, one of the
greatest in the world,

585
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:32,135
and now l'm reduced to being
the greatest cocksucker in the world.

586
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,968
Without my Claire, life is meaningless.

587
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,134
Hey, that's my wife!

588
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:40,634
ls that what you call her?

589
00:50:41,833 --> 00:50:43,134
So you're really not my Lardass?

590
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:45,300
l'm not Lardass, l'm Chester!

591
00:50:46,333 --> 00:50:48,301
l'm iust a common street whore
who happens to know

592
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:49,633
the key to inter-dimensional travel.

593
00:50:50,666 --> 00:50:51,633
lnter-dimensional travel?

594
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,967
The ability to travel
between dimensions.

595
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:57,902
And then my Claire was kidnapped,
by your goons, evil crime Lord.

596
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:01,235
Then l iust gave up the proiect,
gave up my life as l knew it.

597
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:04,568
But what do you care? To you l'm iust
a little piece of human shit

598
00:51:04,933 --> 00:51:06,734
another life shattered by your evil reign.

599
00:51:07,766 --> 00:51:10,401
Another story to tell your cronies
while sitting up in your mansion

600
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:12,401
up there 4 blocks up on the right.

601
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:19,236
What's the matter? My lips aren't sweet
enough for your toxic testicle nectar?

602
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:20,900
Don't worry, Chester, l'll be back.

603
00:51:21,433 --> 00:51:23,735
Well when you come back
you'd better bring cash or pastries

604
00:51:23,933 --> 00:51:25,734
or you're not gonna get to touch this ass.

605
00:51:28,266 --> 00:51:31,068
Melvin, is that you?
l heard what happened at school today.

606
00:51:31,766 --> 00:51:32,733
You can hear?

607
00:51:33,099 --> 00:51:34,734
Of course l can hear.

608
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,401
l was so worried about you.

609
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:40,735
ARer all, our soon to be baby
needs a daddy.

610
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:46,737
And look at the little baby outfit
l made, there's even a little mop.

611
00:51:49,266 --> 00:51:50,400
Wait. You're pregnant?

612
00:51:50,766 --> 00:51:52,400
Well, yeah l'm pregnant.

613
00:51:53,266 --> 00:51:53,933
Melvin,

614
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:56,400

00:51:57,533 --> 00:51:59,334
they're so soR.

616
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:04,669
Oooh, your manly chest,
it's not quite so manly anymore.

617
00:52:07,366 --> 00:52:08,834
Umm, l've been eating a lot of
melons lately.

618
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:13,836
Oooh, Melvin! Somehow your wiener has
miraculously turned into a vagina.

619
00:52:16,866 --> 00:52:18,167
What's going on around here?

620
00:52:18,866 --> 00:52:20,667
Just relax.
Oooow!

621
00:52:21,699 --> 00:52:23,668
lt's good for our relationship,

622
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,834
it's good for the baby.

623
00:52:28,866 --> 00:52:30,667
Yeah, ok. Whooo!

624
00:52:31,199 --> 00:52:33,335
Yeah, it's good for the baby, baby.

625

Of course l can see, stupid.

749
01:05:33,766 --> 01:05:36,735
Tromadu, where man and beast play,

750
01:05:39,766 --> 01:05:42,735
and women play with each other.

751
01:05:51,266 --> 01:05:54,235

at one of the famous Tromadu

757
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:08,169
grotto parties.

758
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:15,168
Look here, it's the Toxic Avenger,

759
01:06:15,233 --> 01:06:16,667
Tromaville's newest mayor.

760
01:06:16,733 --> 01:06:18,668
Mr. Toxie, how did you find cultural

761
01:06:18,733 --> 01:06:22,169
conditions in Tromaville?

762
01:06:22,699 --> 01:06:25,669
With great difficulty.

763
01:06:27,699 --> 01:06:29,668
Hey Toxie, what do you make of this

01:06:52,199 --> 01:06:54,635
l could die in these breasts.

771
01:06:54,699 --> 01:06:56,601
Bullseye!
Cupid strikes again.

772
01:07:00,966 --> 01:07:02,100
And so does Toxie.

01:07:10,466 --> 01:07:14,102
That's what l call a faceliR.
Looking good, Toxie.

774
01:07:15,133 --> 01:07:17,768
At Tromadu,
Toxie is always ahead in the polls,

775
01:07:18,966 --> 01:07:19,933
or a pole in the head.

776
01:07:20,599 --> 01:07:21,100
Whoopsie daisy.

777
01:07:22,466 --> 01:07:24,434

Uh, What's that on your face, Toxie?
Nose blood.

780
01:07:41,466 --> 01:07:43,935
Toxie promises his first action
as mayor will be to kill

781
01:07:44,133 --> 01:07:46,602
all those goofy superheroes,
especially Kabukiman.

782
01:07:48,133 --> 01:07:50,535
Oh my gosh, we're doomed.
We're doomed.

841
01:13:17,133 --> 01:13:18,267
Do you remember the cheese?

842
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,934
l saved the cheese for you, Claire.

843
01:13:24,633 --> 01:13:27,268
l've been waiting so long to
cut the cheese for you, Claire.

844
01:13:50,633 --> 01:13:51,767
Oh Claire, l love you.

845
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:58,867
You're pregnant!
Ha-ha-ha!

846
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:01,533
That's wonderful doctor!

847
01:14:02,566 --> 01:14:04,367
You're pregnant with two babies.

848
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,200
Two babies!?

849
01:14:08,733 --> 01:14:10,868
From what appears to be two
completely different fathers.

850
01:14:12,733 --> 01:14:13,700
And that's preposterous!

851
01:14:16,233 --> 01:14:17,367
That must be

852
01:14:18,233 --> 01:14:19,033
good

853
01:14:19,566 --> 01:14:20,533
and evil.

854
01:14:21,233 --> 01:14:22,200
Right.

855
01:14:23,566 --> 01:14:25,200
Well what can l do about that doctor?

856
01:14:26,733 --> 01:14:28,034
Well l'm glad you asked that question.

857
01:14:29,733 --> 01:14:30,533
Nurse?

858
01:14:32,566 --> 01:14:33,867
Oh lovely, iust like that. Thank you.

859
01:14:35,733 --> 01:14:39,203
What l have done is extracted the actual
fluid from the feti inside your body.

860
01:14:43,399 --> 01:14:45,869
This is the good fluid,
this is the evil fluid.

861
01:14:45,966 --> 01:14:47,033
You can tell because it's red.

862
01:14:47,899 --> 01:14:49,701
Now, inside your body you
have to make a choice

863
01:14:52,566 --> 01:14:54,868
because these two right, they're
fighting, fighting, fighting.

864
01:14:55,066 --> 01:14:57,468
One will win, and eventually
this is what it will look like.

865
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,133
That sizzles.

866
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:05,633
That will be you.

867
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,134
The choice is very simple
and clearly yours.

868
01:15:09,333 --> 01:15:12,803
Either A, you can choose to explode,
or B, you can choose to abort.

869
01:15:14,166 --> 01:15:17,302
Explode or abort.
What does one do?!

870
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:21,134
l'll have to think about that, doctor.

871
01:15:22,333 --> 01:15:25,302
Ponder not too long because actually
you only have about two or three hours

872
01:15:25,500 --> 01:15:26,968
until this whole process takes place.

873
01:15:33,166 --> 01:15:34,800
Melvin, where are you!?

Tromaville Abortion Clinic,
may l help you?

877
01:15:48,666 --> 01:15:50,801
l'm sorry but the doctor's
still in the topless bar,

878
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,968
uh, l mean an appointment.

879
01:15:54,166 --> 01:15:55,634
Would you like his voicemail?

880
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:01,402
Choose life or die!
Choose life or die!

881
01:16:02,433 --> 01:16:04,735
Choose life or die!
Choose life or die!

882
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,902
Choose life or die!

883
01:16:09,433 --> 01:16:11,568
Woah, it sure is hot out here today.

884
01:16:18,766 --> 01:16:19,733
Hello?
Excuse me,

885
01:16:21,766 --> 01:16:23,901
is this the line for
the family planning?

886
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:27,400
No?

887
01:16:27,766 --> 01:16:28,900
Burn in hell, abortion bitch!

888
01:16:33,433 --> 01:16:36,402
At least this sweet gentle rain
will cool things off today.

889
01:16:42,933 --> 01:16:43,900
Oh my goodness!

890
01:16:45,766 --> 01:16:47,234
Oh my goodness, sweetie, look at you!

891
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:50,401
Quick we gotta get you
t ASAP. 02=1 6=55=1 5,02=1 6=51=1 O,Careful. We !
good care of you.

892
01:16:55,266 --> 01:16:57,668
Well, l'm really only here
to weigh my options.

893
01:16:58,699 --> 01:16:59,834
Options? Oh we've got lots of options!

894
01:17:01,699 --> 01:17:04,002
Let's see, first we open up your
vagina with this speculum,

895
01:17:07,866 --> 01:17:09,834
and take this instrument,
a little sort of like a harpoon,

896
01:17:11,699 --> 01:17:12,834
and we can shove on in and

897
01:17:15,866 --> 01:17:17,167
Why, what's the matter, my dear?

898
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:19,000
l think l'm going into labor.

899
01:17:20,699 --> 01:17:24,003
Oh my goodness, we better abort
in a hurry, Doctor Cassidy!

900
01:17:30,699 --> 01:17:32,001
What seems to be the problem,
Miss Scraper?

901
01:17:33,033 --> 01:17:35,001
This young lady needs to be
de-foetused, stat!

902
01:17:36,033 --> 01:17:39,002
Ah, an excellent choice, my dear.
And so much better for the children,

903
01:17:39,366 --> 01:17:40,333
l'm sure you'll agree.

904
01:17:40,699 --> 01:17:42,668
Now let's iust take a tiny
little listen, ok?

905
01:17:44,866 --> 01:17:46,167
Whoa, my, my, that one is lively,
isn't it.

906
01:17:50,199 --> 01:17:53,002
That fuckin' speculum, l told you to
put the mother-fucker away!

My anus!
My fuckin' butthole!

911
01:18:18,966 --> 01:18:20,100
Call a doctor!

912
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,934
Tromaville Abortion Clinic,

913
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,268
l'm sorry but the doctor iust
died of rectal hemorrhaging.

914
01:18:32,966 --> 01:18:34,100
Would you like his voicemail?

915
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,934
lt's alright, it's ok.

916
01:18:37,966 --> 01:18:38,933
lt's ok Toxie.

917
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:40,934
Look! l told you he'd be here!

918
01:18:42,466 --> 01:18:44,601
Claire says that she knew
you'd be here, in this dump!

919
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:46,767
lt's the only place l know.

920
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:49,935
We'd like to thank you again,
for bringing us back together.

921
01:18:51,133 --> 01:18:52,100
Yes, thank you.

922
01:18:53,633 --> 01:18:54,600
So come on, let's get you out of here.

923
01:18:55,633 --> 01:18:56,533
What's the point?

924
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:01,036
l mean l belong here in the dump with
the garbage and the rotting food.

925
01:19:02,566 --> 01:19:03,700
You seem to have forgotten something.

926
01:19:04,566 --> 01:19:07,535
l'm a physicist. When l said l was
gonna get you out of here,

927
01:19:07,899 --> 01:19:08,867
l meant this dimension!

928
01:19:09,733 --> 01:19:10,533
Dimension.

929
01:19:11,566 --> 01:19:12,533
Come on.

930
01:19:12,733 --> 01:19:13,366
Come on.

931
01:19:13,733 --> 01:19:14,700
Let's go.
We Go

932
01:19:16,566 --> 01:19:19,702
A scientific comrade of mine was
recently killed in a freak accident,

933
01:19:20,399 --> 01:19:22,702
and he bequeathed me his
y 02=19=21=10,02=19=30=05,and all of his insanl
inter-dimensional travel.

934
01:19:26,899 --> 01:19:27,700
Travel.

935
01:19:28,733 --> 01:19:29,700
l hope you don't mind the mess.

936
01:19:30,066 --> 01:19:31,200
Um, no, l didn't even notice it.

937
01:19:33,733 --> 01:19:34,867
Now let's get you back to Tromaville.

938
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:57,134
l think l've got it, Toxie.

939
01:20:59,000 --> 01:21:00,634
l've found the key to
inter-dimensional travel

940
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,134
in this seldom read scientific tome.

941
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,301
Please tell me it doesn't
involve exploding

942
01:21:05,833 --> 01:21:06,967
a school full of special children.

943
01:21:08,166 --> 01:21:09,133
No, it's much simpler.

944
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,469
You see Toxie, You've had the power
to go home this whole time.

945
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:20,134
These will help you find your way.

946
01:21:23,166 --> 01:21:23,966
Oy gevalt.

947
01:21:24,833 --> 01:21:25,800
Ooooh.

948
01:21:29,666 --> 01:21:30,800
The operating procedures
are quite simple.

949
01:21:32,166 --> 01:21:35,636
All you have to do is think of home
and click your heels three times.

950
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,634
You may have to try this
more than once.

951
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:42,634
lnter-dimensional travel is not
an exact science.

952
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,467
You might find yourself in Heaven.

953
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,801
Or you might find yourself on a
1910's gay porno set.

954
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:49,133
Ready?

955
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:51,466
Upsy daisy.

956
01:21:52,833 --> 01:21:54,301
Come on, Tito.
Come on, Tito, hop up.

957
01:21:54,833 --> 01:21:55,733
l'm not going.

958
01:21:58,433 --> 01:21:59,567
What do you mean you're not going?

959
01:22:01,766 --> 01:22:03,734
Tito, come on, we've got to go
back to

960
01:22:03,933 --> 01:22:04,900
We don't belong here.

961
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:07,734
l don't belong anywhere.

962
01:22:09,766 --> 01:22:12,568
But as long as there are people
like evil mabuki pagoop

963
01:22:14,933 --> 01:22:19,070
Kabukiman running around, l must stay
and protect the citizens of Amortville.

964
01:22:21,266 --> 01:22:22,734
l have become the Retarded Revenger!

965
01:22:25,766 --> 01:22:27,567
Don't forget about your sidekick, Pompey,

966
01:22:27,766 --> 01:22:30,568
the baddest bodyless mother-fucker
in all of Amortville.

967
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,735
l want you to have this,
in memory of Lardass.

968
01:22:41,266 --> 01:22:43,401
Actually, Tito, you've already
made me proud.

969
01:22:44,766 --> 01:22:45,399
My man

970
01:22:45,933 --> 01:22:46,900
l will miss you,

971
01:22:49,100 --> 01:22:49,900
Toxic Avenger.

972
01:22:52,433 --> 01:22:53,567
l'll miss you too, Tito.

973
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:55,667
Yeah,
can l have my blanket?

974
01:23:02,533 --> 01:23:03,000
Ready?

975
01:23:05,699 --> 01:23:08,669
There's no place like Tromaville.
There's no place like Tromaville.

976
01:23:10,366 --> 01:23:11,667
There's no place like Tromaville.

977
01:23:30,699 --> 01:23:32,668
Uh Oh What's
What the What the

978
01:23:37,366 --> 01:23:38,500

Polio

986
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,435
God, l kinda think they invented
a cure for that one.

987
01:24:13,800 --> 01:24:14,934
Godammit! Well that's alright.

988
01:24:16,466 --> 01:24:17,934
Every time they come up with a cure
for one disease,

989
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:19,768
l come up with something
even more deadly!

990
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,101
AIDS. Now that was a good one!

991
01:24:23,633 --> 01:24:24,433
AIDS!

992
01:24:30,966 --> 01:24:32,600
God?
Yeah, what do you want?

993
01:24:33,633 --> 01:24:34,600
We iust wanna go home.

994

You bastard!
What do you wanna go home for!?

995

This is Heaven!
This is the best place around!

996
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:42,933
Ok.

997
01:24:44,966 --> 01:24:48,436
God, l think this is the
Toxic Avenger, he's from Tromaville.

998
01:24:49,466 --> 01:24:50,934
Alright, you can go back to Tromaville,

999
01:24:52,466 --> 01:24:53,934
but you gotta do me two favors!
Uh-huh.

1000
01:24:54,633 --> 01:24:57,869
First you gotta kick the asses
of all the murderers and child rapists!

1001
01:24:57,933 --> 01:24:58,533
Yeah.

1002
01:24:59,233 --> 01:25:02,369

about me, he doesn't know me.

Alright God! You're awesome!

01:25:17,899 --> 01:25:20,535
All those other super human heroes
would've died anyways.

1007
01:25:22,233 --> 01:25:23,534
Now l've got Toxie's shack,

1008
01:25:24,899 --> 01:25:28,536
we're drinkin' we got some bimbos
on the way, it's all good.

1009
01:25:31,566 --> 01:25:33,534
There's no place like Tromaville.
There's no place like Tromaville.

1010
01:25:39,566 --> 01:25:41,534
Noxie he's gonna kill.
Oh what do l do?

1011
01:25:42,566 --> 01:25:45,869
l iust had the weirdest dream!
And Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD you were there.

1012
01:25:47,233 --> 01:25:49,368
Except you were evil
and you kicked my ass.

1013
01:25:50,566 --> 01:25:51,533
And you!

1014
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:53,533
You weren't there.

1015
01:25:54,233 --> 01:25:55,200
And you!

1016
01:25:55,666 --> 01:25:56,967
You weren't there either.

1017
01:25:58,333 --> 01:25:59,467
Who are you guys? What're you
doing in my shack?

1018
01:26:00,166 --> 01:26:01,133
Don't hurt me.

1019
01:26:03,166 --> 01:26:05,968
Kabuk, where's Sarah? What's going on?
What happened to you?

1020
01:26:07,666 --> 01:26:08,299
Toxie?

1021
01:26:09,166 --> 01:26:11,301
Toxie is that really you?
Is that the real you?

1022
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:13,467
Yeah it's me.

1023
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,133
Oh thank God,

1024
01:26:17,166 --> 01:26:19,301
Hey you've gotta stop yourself,
the evil version of you.

1025
01:26:21,500 --> 01:26:22,467
You've gone power mad.

1026
01:26:23,500 --> 01:26:24,634
The evil version of me?

1027
01:26:26,833 --> 01:26:27,800
Sweetie Honey!

1028
01:26:29,666 --> 01:26:30,800
Then it wasn't a dream!

1029
01:26:32,500 --> 01:26:33,300
Where's Sarah?

1030
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:35,134
l saw her at the hospital.

1031
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,803
She's been kidnapped by the evil
Toxic Avenger, the evil you, and

1032
01:26:39,833 --> 01:26:42,635
Wait, you don't wanna go in there.
It's all sealed up tight now

and they got a shit load of guards
and they all know kung fu and

1034
01:26:46,333 --> 01:26:46,966
Ok, ok.

1035
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:50,302
We've got to get the other heroes
of Tromaville and storm the hospital!

1036
01:26:50,500 --> 01:26:51,300
They're all dead.

1037
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,568
All of them?
Yep.

1038
01:26:56,933 --> 01:26:58,067

Go check it out.

1057

And make sure whatever he's talking
about doesn't make it to this floor!

01:29:57,633 --> 01:29:58,600
l've gotta find Sarah!

1059
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:02,435

like they have at the mall.

1060
01:30:02,633 --> 01:30:03,600

Toxie.

1070
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:20,801
You blew up a school filled
with special children.

1071
01:32:22,833 --> 01:32:23,967
What's inside your head?

1072

Let's find out shall we?

1073
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:33,967

Not only am l gonna kill you,

1079
01:34:47,699 --> 01:34:48,167
No!

1080
01:35:52,466 --> 01:35:55,202
l don't have to fill my body
with plastics and silicone!

1081
01:35:58,899 --> 01:35:59,867
My eye is real!

1082
01:36:01,233 --> 01:36:01,499
Doink!

1083
01:36:03,066 --> 01:36:04,033
My dick is real!

01:36:08,066 --> 01:36:10,201
And my colon is real
and my large intestine is real.

1089
01:36:52,233 --> 01:36:52,866

01:38:36,933 --> 01:38:37,900
she's hemorrhaging!

1113
01:38:40,433 --> 01:38:41,567
No no, this is iust dick tissue.

1114
01:38:44,433 --> 01:38:45,233
Hello? Hello?

1115
01:38:47,766 --> 01:38:48,566

1116
01:38:49,766 --> 01:38:49,966
Tonight at 1 1 , bad Toxie goes out

will be taking some of our local
super heroes shopping for tights.

She looks iust like her mother.

And l've also brought the special
students in to thank you, too.

01:39:40,699 --> 01:39:41,667
Come on in kids.

1131

Hey Sweetie.

1132
01:39:45,699 --> 01:39:46,500
Toxie

Wow. Thanks kids.

And Toxie, l want you to have
the blanky for the baby,

1138
01:40:04,866 --> 01:40:06,834
cause l'm a very big girl now
and l don't need it.

1139
01:40:08,366 --> 01:40:08,999
Are you sure?

1140
01:40:09,533 --> 01:40:10,667
Just ask Sgt. Kabukiman.

1141
01:40:13,366 --> 01:40:14,333
Hey hey hey!

1142
01:40:15,366 --> 01:40:17,334
Hey! Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD,
my best friend.

01:40:17,533 --> 01:40:18,333
How ya feelin'?

1144
01:40:18,533 --> 01:40:19,166
Not too bad.

1145
01:40:19,866 --> 01:40:22,668
Doctors say my arm and leg should
be healed in a couple of weeks.

1146
01:40:23,033 --> 01:40:25,335
l iust can't wait to get the
stitches removed from my anus.

1147
01:40:25,699 --> 01:40:27,501
Anus anus anus anus anus anus!

1148
01:40:34,366 --> 01:40:34,999
Knock knock.

1149
01:40:37,199 --> 01:40:40,002
Pompey, you got a new body,
you're just not a head anymore.

1150
01:40:40,866 --> 01:40:41,833

1151
01:40:46,533 --> 01:40:48,668
Now we could talk about head
and all that stuff later,

1152
01:40:49,366 --> 01:40:51,334
but are you ready to meet your
other new child?

1153
01:40:52,366 --> 01:40:53,500
Wait a minute, another child?

1154
01:40:53,866 --> 01:40:55,767
The evil baby!

1155
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:59,769
l think a child is as much a product
of his environment as anything.

1156
01:41:00,300 --> 01:41:02,268
And l think we have enough love to
raise any kid as a good kid.

1157
01:41:03,633 --> 01:41:05,101
Well, if you think so, Melvin.

1158
01:41:09,633 --> 01:41:11,267
Yeah, a real American family
for the new millennium.

1159
01:41:11,633 --> 01:41:12,433
Awesome!

1160
01:41:15,633 --> 01:41:16,600
Now let's take a peek.

1161
01:41:26,633 --> 01:41:27,433
What?

1162
01:41:28,633 --> 01:41:29,433
What?

1163
01:41:33,633 --> 01:41:34,600
Hey, cute kid.

1164
01:41:36,300 --> 01:41:36,933
Uh-oh.

1165
01:41:37,966 --> 01:41:39,267
Toxie, Toxie, l can explain.

1166
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:42,934
l was drunk, she was tied down.

1167
01:41:45,300 --> 01:41:46,267
l forgot to zip up.

1168
01:41:48,466 --> 01:41:49,266
Alright, later.

1169
01:42:11,899 --> 01:42:13,368
Due to the depletion of the ozone layer

1170
01:42:13,899 --> 01:42:15,701
and the careless dumping of
hazardous nuclear waste

1171
01:42:17,733 --> 01:42:19,701
thousands of people
find themselves trapped

1172
01:42:21,066 --> 01:42:24,536
in an evil parallel universe every year
and the numbers are rising.

1173
01:42:35,233 --> 01:42:38,536
This film is respectfully dedicated
to those who have lost their lives

1174
01:42:41,566 --> 01:42:43,034
facing down their own
evil doppelgangers.

1175
01:42:53,233 --> 01:42:56,636
So if you find yourself thrust into an
