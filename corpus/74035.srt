1
00:01:36,062 --> 00:01:38,997
In St. Petersburg, Florida,
this 52-year-old man

2
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:43,092
Iets these two young women
into the house.

3
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:47,139
They lifted up their tops,
exposed themselves to the guy...

4
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,435
Chief Whitlock.

5
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,978
Chief Whitlock, it's Ann.
Ann Merai Harrison.

6
00:01:54,047 --> 00:01:56,140
Somebody just
broke into my house.

7
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:58,047
All right. Be right over, ma'am.

8
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,271
How you doing, Miss Harrison?

9
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,140
Chief.

10
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,916
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

11
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,246
Mind if I come in?

12
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,580
- Come in.
- Thank you.

13
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:37,319
Oh, boy.

14
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:45,260
Did you get a good look
at this fellow?

15
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,094
Yeah.

16
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,098
He was about your height.

17
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,673
Your weight.

18
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,140
Come to think of it,
he kind of looked like you.

19
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:59,337
Looked like me?
So he was good-looking?

20
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,344
No.

21
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,748
Sorry. Just not my type.

22
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:10,218
So this "ugly" man--
you know how he got in the house?

23
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,624
The bedroom window.

24
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,068
It's all right
if I come in your bedroom?

25
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,609
Yeah. Come in.

26
00:03:31,678 --> 00:03:33,646
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

27
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,910
Okay. I was asleep.

28
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:40,077
But then I woke up
'cause I felt something.

29
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,650
I saw the windowwas open...

30
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:48,584
...and he was standing
right where you are.

31
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:49,821
Right here?

32
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,420
You sure?

33
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:55,160
All right, so what did he do?

34
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,363
He came toward me.

35
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,868
He came toward you?

36
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,134
Like this?

37
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:06,942
Then he grabbed me.

38
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,413
- Where?
- Right here.

39
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,009
Like that?

40
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,020
But he was much stronger
than you.

41
00:04:17,023 --> 00:04:18,854
Like that?

42
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,655
He forced himself
on top of me.

43
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:23,355
Like that?

44
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:27,365
His breath smelled like he'd been
drinking on the job, like yours.

45
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:30,197
- Really? What happened next?
- He kissed me.

46
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,430
Where?

47
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,265
Where, baby?

48
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,405
And he stripped me naked.

49
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,472
I was confused.
He ripped my shirt off.

50
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,220
You didn't put up
much of a fight, did you?

51
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:59,826
Oh, really? I didn't
put up much of a fight?

52
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,624
So you took control?

53
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:06,331
What did you do next?
What did you do, baby?

54
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,838
Watch me.

55
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,872
Tell me what you did next, baby.

56
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:20,508
Chief, you've got to get down
to the Scuttlebutt.

57
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:23,180
We've got a situation here.
It's about to blow.

58
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,416
Chief?

59
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:28,519
- Yeah, T ony, what's up?
- Where are you, Chief?

60
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,858
Can you get here?
We need you to come quick.

61
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,594
- Chief?
- Okay.

62
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,137
Look, T ony, I'm...

63
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,368
...coming now.

64
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:44,306
- No.
- I've got to go, baby.

65
00:05:44,377 --> 00:05:46,743
I've got to go.

66
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:48,542
I've got to go to work.

67
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:53,243
So we'll pick up
on this crime tomorrow?

68
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,651
- Okay.
- What kind of crime?

69
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,020
- Assault with a deadly weapon.
- Breaking and entering.

70
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:02,220
See you later, baby.

71
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:41,184
- How y'all doing?
- Good, Chief.

72
00:07:44,931 --> 00:07:46,023
Morning.

73
00:07:59,512 --> 00:08:03,278
- Mathias Lee Whitlock.
- How you doing, Chris?

74
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,682
Having breakfast
with all your friends here?

75
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:13,086
I would invite you, Chris,
but I don't want to.

76
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,994
I'd sit down, but I don't want to.

77
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:21,500
- Did they find us a table?
- Yeah, we're in the back.

78
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,866
- Matt.
- How you doing, Ann?

79
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:27,337
Okay. I'm starving.

80
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,772
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you, too.

81
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,936
Hey, Chris, try the crab.
It's real good.

82
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,606
- I'm allergic.
- I know.

83
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,908
Right.

84
00:09:13,586 --> 00:09:15,611
- How you doing, Sharlene?
- Hey, Chief.

85
00:09:15,688 --> 00:09:17,451
- What time is it?
- It's 3:00.

86
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,115
3:00. Let's go.

87
00:09:20,192 --> 00:09:23,286
Hey, man, you're
out of paper towels again.

88
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,126
- How you doing, Chae?
- Good.

89
00:09:26,198 --> 00:09:28,632
Thought the camera
only added ten pounds.

90
00:09:28,701 --> 00:09:32,000
- Looks good, doesn't it?
- Kind of, in a pudgy way.

91
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,302
I thought this might be
an opportune time

92
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,842
to revisit my offer
to invest in that business venture.

93
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,105
- Costa Rica?
- Chartered fishing boat.

94
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:43,171
- Steal the evidence money?
- You file a report on that yet?

95
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,017
- Is that it?
- That's it.

96
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,680
- 485 grand. Can I touch it?
- No, you can't.

97
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,417
- I just want to touch it.
- Get your hands out of there.

98
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,990
- Maybe I'll just steal it.
- Maybe I'll just shoot you.

99
00:09:57,063 --> 00:10:00,692
Stop thinking like a cop.
Just listen to my proposition.

100
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,903
We'll take a grand out.
We'll go to the boat show.

101
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,632
We'll just walk around
with the money in our pocket,

102
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,938
get a sense of what it feels like
to knowwe could buy a boat.

103
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,945
- I'll see you in a minute.
- What do you think?

104
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,418
- Chae.
- Stranger.

105
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:24,251
- How you doing?
- How you doing, Alex?

106
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:25,620
I need your keys.

107
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,091
I'm fine, thanks for asking.
How about you?

108
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,095
Listen, I need your keys.
I left a couple of things.

109
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,393
- Okay. I'll go with you.
- No.

110
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:38,031
Why not?
I just want to go with you.

111
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:42,130
I don't want to get into anything.
I got a lot of work to do today.

112
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,642
- I know your work is important.
- Are you going to start with that?

113
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,112
I'm gonna go in the other room
and pretend to make a phone call.

114
00:10:49,181 --> 00:10:52,378
- Congrats on making detective.
- Thanks, Chae.

115
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,984
Forget it.

116
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:59,491
Even if I left the Hope Diamond
in there, it's just not worth it.

117
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:03,861
- Bye, Matt.
- Good-bye, Alex.

118
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,198
Would you just give me
the goddamn keys?

119
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,601
They're on the desk
right in front of you.

120
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,108
I'll drop them off.

121
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,607
- See you.
- See you, sweetie.

122
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:30,118
She looks good.

123
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,817
Sometimes I think you
want me to shoot you.

124
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,757
Wait. Hold that thought.

125
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,654
Medical examiner.

126
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:46,332
Yeah. All right. What kind of prick
dies at cocktail hour on a Friday?

127
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:48,430
The nerve of some people.

128
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,203
- Have a good one.
- Yeah, see you.

129
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,776
Catch anything?

130
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,471
Trying to catch my self-respect.

131
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,714
Figuring out what it is I'm doing
in the middle of this...threesome.

132
00:12:33,786 --> 00:12:37,085
Try foursome.
You're forgetting your wife.

133
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:44,187
She left me. I told her the other day--
told her today--come get her stuff.

134
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,754
How's the pro football quarterback?

135
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:48,993
He's up north
hunting for the weekend.

136
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,504
The whole weekend.

137
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,307
I got a splinter in my butt. You okay?

138
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:43,755
I'm okay. I'm definitely okay.

139
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,085
It's all right.

140
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,752
- You still love her.
- Huh?

141
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,593
You still love her, don't you?

142
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,758
Yeah, I do.

143
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,769
Yeah, you do.
Will you divorce her?

144
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:00,862
- You still got your ring on.
- Chris needs me.

145
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,339
- Oh, okay.
- He does.

146
00:14:04,743 --> 00:14:07,541
He's lost, been that way
since he got cut from the team.

147
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,244
I guess I feel sorry for him.

148
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:14,150
Remember that the next time
he goes upside your head.

149
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,640
Okay. Sure.

150
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,340
All right. I'll be right there.

151
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,378
- Ann Merai. Hi.
- Dr. Frieland.

152
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,712
- This is my brother Matt.
- Nice to meet you.

153
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:19,910
Sorry to bring you in today.
I was in surgery all day yesterday.

154
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,145
Please.

155
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,616
You can talk in front of him.
It's fine.

156
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:41,467
Right. Okay. Ann, I'm afraid
there's been a bit of a setback.

157
00:15:43,475 --> 00:15:45,443
I had your tests back yesterday.

158
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:53,512
The cancer is not in remission.
It's come back very aggressively.

159
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:55,815
It's attacked your liver and lungs.

160
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:08,924
How long?

161
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,031
Well, that's difficult to say.

162
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,196
How long?

163
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:19,506
Five, six months.
No one can say for sure.

164
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,048
But I feel fine.

165
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:41,931
Listen...there's a counselor here
at the hospital I'd like you to see.

166
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,198
She's very good.
She'll help you during this period.

167
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,431
Thank you for coming in
on your day off.

168
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:49,029
Ann, wait.

169
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:56,141
Excuse me. Maybe you could
speak to her about the counseling?

170
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:01,214
Listen, you should be able
to do something, right?

171
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,915
What about that experimental stuff?
You know, like "60 Minutes"?

172
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:10,724
I don't know. There are
alternative approaches.

173
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:11,956
- Yeah?
- Sure.

174
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,625
Let's see.

175
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,727
Autologous cancer vaccines,
hematology procedures,

176
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:21,965
hyperthermia treatments.

177
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:24,042
Here. Take a look at those.

178
00:17:24,109 --> 00:17:27,670
They're extremely expensive,
and there are no guarantees.

179
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,850
- Thanks.
- Okay.

180
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,682
You all right?

181
00:17:39,758 --> 00:17:41,692
Yeah.

182
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,591
Why didn't you tell me, baby?

183
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,928
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,764
When I was with you...

185
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,703
I forgot about it.

186
00:17:52,805 --> 00:17:55,273
For a couple hours,
I didn't think about dying.

187
00:17:56,642 --> 00:17:58,405
I understand.

188
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,447
You know, they've got
this alternative stuff.

189
00:18:10,522 --> 00:18:12,820
There's a clinic in Switzerland--

190
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,452
I know. With my blood. I don't
put much stock in all that stuff.

191
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:20,589
They said there's a 1 7% chance,
a 1 7% success rate.

192
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,361
A whole 1 7%?

193
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:25,135
Odds are better I'd hit the lottery,

194
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,933
which is what I'd have to do
to afford something like that.

195
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,680
Listen. Where are you going?

196
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,879
I don't think we should
do this anymore.

197
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,914
It wasn't right for me
to drag you into this.

198
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:54,027
You didn't drag me into anything.
I'm a big boy.

199
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,190
Matt, I'm dying.

200
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,600
I'm dying.

201
00:19:12,417 --> 00:19:15,147
- Thanks for the flowers.
- You're welcome.

202
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:17,450
The girls at work were so jealous.

203
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,287
Glad to hear that.
That's not why you called me.

204
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:24,022
- What's up?
- I want to show you something.

205
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:28,461
- Chris didn't hit you again?
- No.

206
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:35,099
When we were married, we took out
insurance policies on each other,

207
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:37,641
but they were only
for $1 00,000.

208
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,008
This says $1 million.
Did you know about this?

209
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:46,381
No. I remember signing things,
but I didn't know he'd made changes.

210
00:19:46,451 --> 00:19:49,784
He can't get away with this.
This is fraud. You were sick.

211
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,154
No. I was diagnosed
six months ago.

212
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,523
Chris increased the policy
almost a year ago,

213
00:19:55,594 --> 00:19:57,755
right after my 32nd birthday.

214
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:03,257
My mother was 33
when she died of cancer.

215
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,269
Oh, no.

216
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:13,969
- That Chris?
- He's here.

217
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:16,172
- Maybe he can explain this.
- No.

218
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,978
- Why not? Now's the time.
- This is not the time.

219
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,576
- When is the time?
- I don't know.

220
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,518
Please. I'm sorry, baby.

221
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,929
I'm just taking the trash out.

222
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:38,333
Thought you were working
a double tonight.

223
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,206
Yeah. Bet you did.

224
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,212
Howwas your appointment
on Saturday?

225
00:20:57,723 --> 00:21:00,191
- Appointment?
- Yeah, with Dr. Frieland.

226
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,955
I didn't have an appointment.

227
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:06,464
- No? You sure?
- I'm sure.

228
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:09,432
'Cause Jay saw you
go inside his office.

229
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,526
You were going inside
with some other guy.

230
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:14,197
No, I just stopped by.
I had to ask some questions.

231
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:15,534
Now you were there.

232
00:21:15,641 --> 00:21:18,576
I was there, but I had to
ask him some questions.

233
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,407
Here we go with the lies again.

234
00:21:20,479 --> 00:21:22,470
- I'm not lying to you.
- Yes, you are!

235
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:24,139
Start telling me the truth!

236
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,918
- You're hurting me!
- Why do you make me do this?

237
00:21:28,987 --> 00:21:30,921
I'm not making you do anything!

238
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:34,481
It ain't my goddamn fault!
It ain't my fault!

239
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:44,161
Chris, how you doing,
football player?

240
00:21:44,236 --> 00:21:45,965
Good, Mathias.
How you doing?

241
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:47,868
I'm good.
Judy Anderson called,

242
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,305
said she saw a prowler
in the neighborhood.

243
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,535
You see anything?

244
00:21:54,513 --> 00:21:56,344
What about your wife?
She home?

245
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,178
She didn't see anything.

246
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:02,016
- You didn't ask her.
- She didn't say anything about it.

247
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,954
Maybe I should ask her, not that
I don't trust your mind-reading.

248
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:08,220
- Hey, Ann, how you doing?
- I didn't see anything.

249
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,863
- I'm going to check the perimeter.
- Go ahead.

250
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:14,956
You see somebody,
you holler.

251
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,170
You have a good night.

252
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:26,567
- We did it.
- This wasn't necessary.

253
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,739
My name shouldn't be on your house.
I'll buy my own in a few years.

254
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,084
All right.

255
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,752
- Chief Whitlock.
- Hey, baby, it's me.

256
00:22:42,828 --> 00:22:46,628
What time do you get off?
I've found a way to go to that clinic.

257
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,757
- Right.
- Can you talk?

258
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,461
- Hold on.
- Forget it.

259
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,832
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

260
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,963
You know, I've got to go.
T ell her I say hi.

261
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:56,301
Bye.

262
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,013
Is this a bad time? Can you talk?

263
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,518
Yeah. It's no problem.

264
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:11,283
You've got to hear this.
It's incredible.

265
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,520
I name you the beneficiary
of my life insurance policy.

266
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:17,357
No, no.
Not me personally.

267
00:23:17,429 --> 00:23:20,660
You name The Living Gift
as your beneficiary

268
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,962
after we purchase
the policy from you.

269
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,935
And you--
I mean, The Living Gift--

270
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:27,800
collects on the policy
when I die.

271
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,534
As the beneficiary, yes,
we collect on the policy.

272
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:34,169
So you make a profit if she dies?
Is that legal?

273
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:37,544
- We wouldn't be here if it wasn't.
- How much do I get?

274
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:41,245
The amount depends on how long
your medical staff says I have to live.

275
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:43,549
How about a ballpark figure?

276
00:23:43,622 --> 00:23:46,420
- $750,000.
- I know.

277
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,921
Even if they have to repeat
the treatment several times,

278
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:52,930
there would be enough money
for us to go somewhere.

279
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,989
Like the Conch Festival
in Key West?

280
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:58,264
No.

281
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,837
Clambake in Opa Locka?

282
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:03,005
No! Europe.

283
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:06,475
- Europe?
- Yeah. Or Africa.

284
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,183
I'm going to beat this.

285
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,752
You watch.

286
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,861
Richard Petty, give me a hand.

287
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,010
Hey, man, watch it.
Don't slip. Watch that blood.

288
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,729
Come on, Ann, talk to me.

289
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:02,790
Their investors won't let them
buy any new policies.

290
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,665
The Living Gift?

291
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:09,696
We can go somewhere else.
We'll get somebody else to buy it.

292
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,368
I can't. There's only
two days left to change it.

293
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:13,671
What do you mean?

294
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:16,509
A provision says the beneficiary
can't be changed after a year,

295
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:17,809
and that's in two days.

296
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:19,783
Well, maybe we could call down...

297
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,318
It's too late!

298
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:32,829
- Listen...
- Don't, don't. Don't.

299
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,589
This is not fixable.

300
00:25:46,144 --> 00:25:47,839
Just go.

301
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:50,644
Just go.

302
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,262
What did Alex pick up
from your place the other day?

303
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:10,767
I don't know.

304
00:26:12,871 --> 00:26:16,329
Well, over for sure now, huh?

305
00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,501
She left something so she'd
have a chance to come see you.

306
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,977
See if she still had feelings.

307
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:26,814
Based on what I saw, she didn't
have any feelings...except anger.

308
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:28,443
Think you've had enough.

309
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,445
I'm trying to help you here.

310
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,821
One of your patrons
has been overserved.

311
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:35,689
I may have to cite you
on that, Helena.

312
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,058
See you tomorrow, Chae.

313
00:26:38,129 --> 00:26:40,063
See you tomorrow.

314
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,262
Man. Bustin' my chops,
Mr. Drinking-On-Duty.

315
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,277
I'll see you later.

316
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,575
- Good night.
- Take it easy.

317
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,613
Let me get you a refill, Chief.

318
00:26:59,684 --> 00:27:02,209
No, I'm good, Chris.

319
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:06,815
It ain't a bribe, just a beer.
Two, whatever he was just drinking.

320
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:13,956
Thank you.

321
00:27:17,035 --> 00:27:19,526
Let me ask you something.

322
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,607
That night you were out there
looking for that prowler,

323
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,232
did you see anybody?

324
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,242
No, I didn't.

325
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:33,774
I had this feeling when I got home
that Ann was with some other guy.

326
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,183
Really?

327
00:27:35,253 --> 00:27:37,847
I think he snuck out the back
when I got home.

328
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,058
No, I didn't see anybody.

329
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,695
I'll tell you what, though.

330
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,673
Next time that little pussy
comes around...

331
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,232
Little pussy?

332
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:03,041
The guy scurries out the back door
the second he hears my voice.

333
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:04,638
- "Scurries"?
- Yeah.

334
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:13,115
I could almost respect a man
who had the balls to confront me,

335
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,627
tell me, "Yeah,
I'm banging your wife."

336
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:20,631
Maybe this guy,

337
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:24,965
maybe there's nothing
he would rather do than to tell you

338
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:28,233
that you're a lousy husband
and don't deserve Ann.

339
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,534
Maybe there's nothing
he would rather do

340
00:28:30,642 --> 00:28:33,133
than to walk up to your face,
look you in the eye,

341
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:39,808
and say to you, "Chris,
I'm banging your wife...good."

342
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:45,584
Maybe. You know, maybe...
your wife won't let him.

343
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,323
I'd respect him at least.

344
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,197
And if he did that,
then I'd go up to him,

345
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:56,028
Iook him in his eye, and I'd say,

346
00:28:56,101 --> 00:28:58,535
"Just come near her again...

347
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:01,962
...and I'll kill you."

348
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:09,275
Wow. You're talking to the wrong guy,
because as a police officer...

349
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,248
I can't let you go around
threatening people's lives.

350
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:15,343
If you're serious, I would
be obligated to do something.

351
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,853
Really?

352
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:18,081
That's right.

353
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:22,826
Thanks for the beer...
and the conversation.

354
00:29:22,894 --> 00:29:28,662
- Thanks for listening.
- You give Ann my best, if you can.

355
00:29:55,426 --> 00:29:56,688
You been waiting long?

356
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,924
Sorry about last night.

357
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,994
You must really be mad at me.

358
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,807
God, I used to love
coming out here with you.

359
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:23,251
I thought I was the shit, being
a freshman making out with a senior.

360
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:24,583
You were.

361
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,182
- Still are.
- I guess I was.

362
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,269
- Here.
- What's this?

363
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,099
My going-away present.

364
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,606
- Going away?
- lnsurance policy.

365
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:49,413
You're making me the beneficiary?

366
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:53,473
Buy that fishing boat you and Chae
have always talked about.

367
00:30:53,551 --> 00:30:54,813
Right.

368
00:30:55,887 --> 00:30:59,050
- Here.
- No. I'm leaving tomorrow.

369
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:00,215
What?

370
00:31:00,291 --> 00:31:02,521
I'm leaving town tomorrow.

371
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:05,652
I've got to get out of here.

372
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:08,893
I need to get away from Chris.
I need some peace.

373
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,761
- Chief Whitlock.
- How can I help you?

374
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,491
You just did, buddy.

375
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,739
- How you doing?
- Good.

376
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,543
Take this.
Meet me at my house.

377
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,583
What is it?

378
00:32:32,650 --> 00:32:34,584
It's a gift to you.

379
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:37,212
- Switzerland.
- What?

380
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,256
- It's money.
- What money?

381
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,620
That drug money?

382
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:48,325
Matt, no. Oh, my God.

383
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:51,029
What if they want it back?

384
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,093
By law, the money
has to stay in the custody

385
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:56,231
of the arresting department
until the appeals process is over.

386
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:58,605
With the money Scarcetti has,
it could take years.

387
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:00,041
But Tony and the guys...

388
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,512
They think I'm putting it
in a safe deposit box.

389
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,877
What time does Chris get home?

390
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:07,077
1 1 :30.

391
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,016
Go to your house, pack a bag,

392
00:33:09,087 --> 00:33:12,056
meet me at my house, 1 1 :00.

393
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,351
You okay?

394
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:16,592
See you later.

395
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,314
What are you doing here?

396
00:33:44,389 --> 00:33:48,018
Barbara's pissed off about something.
Got to wait her out.

397
00:33:50,395 --> 00:33:55,094
Listen. You see anybody
come in here?

398
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:56,497
- No.
- You sure?

399
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,864
Okay. Why don't you
head over to the Scuttlebutt?

400
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,633
They cut me off,
no thanks to you.

401
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,300
Tell them Chief Whitlock
said everything's okay.

402
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,378
That's the first place
Barbara's going to look!

403
00:34:07,478 --> 00:34:08,968
- She won't look there.
- She will!

404
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,241
I've got half a pack
of cigarettes in there!

405
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:12,265
Tell Engine Two to lay it out
and start attacking it from the back!

406
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,496
Go, go!

407
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,138
Pull it up! Let's get moving!

408
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,010
1919 on 415 San Juan.

409
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:26,208
That's about four miles
outside of town.

410
00:36:27,251 --> 00:36:29,344
Go! Let's keep moving!

411
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,012
Aim the hose right there!

412
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:52,200
Mathias, you all right?

413
00:36:53,644 --> 00:36:55,077
I know it's hard to take.

414
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:58,410
I'll grab you a cup of coffee.

415
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,788
- Was it an accident?
- I don't know. Maybe.

416
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:17,129
These propane tanks
just don't blow for no reason.

417
00:37:18,536 --> 00:37:21,300
Man, this place was an inferno.

418
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,873
Those poor folks
didn't have a chance.

419
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,683
Hi, Chief.

420
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,890
Chief.

421
00:37:50,034 --> 00:37:51,501
What are you doing here?

422
00:37:51,569 --> 00:37:54,561
I'm a homicide detective,
and there's two dead bodies.

423
00:37:55,473 --> 00:37:58,738
- So what happened?
- They think the propane tank blew.

424
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,299
You knowwho they are?

425
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:03,437
- I think it's definitely "were."
- Right, Chae.

426
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:05,846
Hey, Mathias, check it out.

427
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:08,512
Definitely arson.

428
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:14,589
It's definitely arson. Definitely.

429
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,723
The closer I stay
to the scene, the better.

430
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,956
Yeah, it's possibly
a double homicide.

431
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,465
We're gonna have to
take this thing over.

432
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:29,836
Chief, Judy Anderson's mom
is visiting from Orlando.

433
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:33,240
Last night, Judy said her mom
saw somebody sneaking around.

434
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,245
I checked it out,
didn't see anything.

435
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,178
We should probably tell Alex.

436
00:38:37,248 --> 00:38:39,409
I'll tell her.
You get back to the office.

437
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,510
They want me to run my investigation
out of your place for the next 24.

438
00:38:43,587 --> 00:38:47,182
I need your help--background
on the vics, people they knew.

439
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,385
- A tour guide?
- You cool with that?

440
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,018
- Okay. No problem.
- Are you sure?

441
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:52,289
No problem at all.

442
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:54,888
Why don't we ride back
and you fill me in on the Harrisons?

443
00:38:54,965 --> 00:38:56,830
My boys will set up at your place.

444
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:58,061
- Okay.
- Great.

445
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:12,773
I just wanted to say
I'm really sorry about the timing.

446
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,283
What do you mean?

447
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,344
With the papers,
and then this today.

448
00:39:17,421 --> 00:39:18,683
The divorce papers?

449
00:39:18,756 --> 00:39:21,520
- I should have called you before.
- That would have been nice.

450
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,686
I know.

451
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:28,928
But it has been eight months.
Don't you think we need closure?

452
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,297
I really don't want
to talk about it.

453
00:39:35,406 --> 00:39:37,135
Thanks for opening up.

454
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:43,847
Let's talk about the Harrisons.
Either of them screwing around?

455
00:39:43,914 --> 00:39:46,576
I don't know. Is anybody
happily married these days?

456
00:39:49,754 --> 00:39:51,619
These have already
been gone through.

457
00:39:51,689 --> 00:39:54,351
Right. He was supposed
to get off at 1 1 :30.

458
00:39:56,594 --> 00:39:58,186
Right. Mr. Harrison.

459
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:03,431
So you don't know if Mr. Harrison
came to work or not. Hold on.

460
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:06,664
Did you know she worked as
a dental hygienist for a Dr. Shider?

461
00:40:06,771 --> 00:40:08,363
Really? No.

462
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,565
I'm going to pay him a visit.
You want to come?

463
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:15,506
Okay. Thanks.

464
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,570
So she quit yesterday?

465
00:40:17,648 --> 00:40:21,311
Well, kind of. Ann Merai
had terminal cancer.

466
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,250
Really?

467
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,811
I think she was
trying to keep it quiet.

468
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:31,692
- Anything else you could tell us?
- I think she was having an affair.

469
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,925
Did she actually tell you
she was having an affair?

470
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:41,394
We don't really talk a lot, mainly
what's happening on our stories.

471
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:43,973
But I just got the feeling.

472
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:49,411
Sometimes when she'd be on
the phone, she would talk real quiet.

473
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,640
Whisper?

474
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:56,386
Did you ever see him,
or did she tell you who he was?

475
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,519
No. But he was classy.

476
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:05,926
About a week ago,
she got flowers from Rosie's.

477
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,488
Really nice. It was beautiful.
Remember, Bruce?

478
00:41:09,567 --> 00:41:11,865
But I met her husband once,

479
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,497
and he just doesn't seem
like the type to send flowers.

480
00:41:15,606 --> 00:41:16,732
Right.

481
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,074
Rosie! Chief Whitlock.

482
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:25,582
Listen, we're trying to find out
if some flowers were sent

483
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:30,313
to an Ann Merai Harrison
last week, sent to her office.

484
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:33,720
Harrison. Check and see
if one of your guys sent them.

485
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:35,782
- What hospital?
- Mercy Med.

486
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,488
- Chris Harrison.
- Her husband.

487
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:42,429
Okay. Thanks a lot, Rosie.

488
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,161
Yeah. No, that's all.

489
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:46,100
Thank you, Rosie.

490
00:41:46,203 --> 00:41:48,467
If you'd like to make a call...

491
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,667
You ready?

492
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,744
I guess so.

493
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,473
Okay. All right.
Thank you for your help.

494
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,106
- Sure.
- Thank you.

495
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:03,586
If you think of anything else,
here's my card. Thanks a lot.

496
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:09,353
Please don't do me like that.
You knew I wasn't finished.

497
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:10,586
I'm sorry.

498
00:42:11,328 --> 00:42:13,956
Dr. Shider gave me the name
of Ann Merai's doctor.

499
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,158
I want to find out more
about her cancer.

500
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,669
You can drop me off
back at the station.

501
00:42:20,771 --> 00:42:23,239
You really don't like
being around me, do you?

502
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,932
No. I just, you know...

503
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:29,138
There isn't any reason for both of us
to be wasting time at the doctor's office.

504
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,044
What's so pressing
that you have to do?

505
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:33,743
I do have a job.
I am Chief of Police.

506
00:42:33,817 --> 00:42:36,615
Yeah, of a four-person
department, Matt.

507
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,985
That's the problem
between the two of us.

508
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,547
You think your job
is more important than my job.

509
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,559
- Never said that.
- Yeah, you did.

510
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,892
You never say it directly,
but in indirect ways you say it.

511
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:50,923
You wanted to leave Banyan Key so we
could be closer to your important job.

512
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,799
You never said the commute
was taking time away from us?

513
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,997
- I didn't have a problem with that.
- You didn't?

514
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:59,542
- So I'm hearing things now?
- Whatever.

515
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:02,773
Is that the reason you're not coming?
Is that your date paging you?

516
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:06,441
One of my four officers checked in.
It's a tracking device.

517
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:08,348
And you can tell on that?

518
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,820
That's what it tells me. GPS.
We're all tied into it.

519
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,188
The mayor's brother sells them,
so we spent half the budget on them.

520
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,820
See, if we were moving,
you'd see it tracking.

521
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,386
Sorry.

522
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:23,365
If we were moving right now,
it would show us tracking.

523
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,492
Great.

524
00:43:24,568 --> 00:43:26,661
Why don't we drive
to the doctor's office,

525
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,499
and I can see how it works?

526
00:43:54,932 --> 00:43:57,298
I'm going to the bathroom.
I'll meet you in there.

527
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,098
- Hi.
- May I help you?

528
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:02,195
Yeah. Dr. Donovan's office.

529
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:06,242
- Her office is on the third floor.
- Thank you, Ramona.

530
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:11,911
Ann Harrison didn't have cancer.

531
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,711
Are you sure?

532
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:15,684
Not counting the time
she spent in Atlanta,

533
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,347
Ann Merai has been my patient
since junior high.

534
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,720
If she had cancer,
I would have known about it.

535
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:23,350
I don't get it.

536
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,726
Maybe she saw another doctor.

537
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,697
She was here for her yearly

538
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,257
when she first got
back to town two months ago,

539
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,599
and she was healthy
as a proverbial horse.

540
00:44:35,205 --> 00:44:38,697
I'm looking it over here, and...

541
00:44:38,809 --> 00:44:41,369
I don't understand.
Who told you she had cancer?

542
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:42,809
Excuse me.

543
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,648
So...

544
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,116
Can I help you?

545
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:27,680
Yeah, I'm looking for Dr. Frieland.

546
00:45:27,758 --> 00:45:29,953
You're looking at him.

547
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:32,791
You're Dr. Frieland?

548
00:45:32,863 --> 00:45:35,661
Yes, I am.

549
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,260
- Hold on, Pop.
- You're sure? This is your office?

550
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:41,633
It has been for ten years, yes.

551
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,163
Look, I'll get back to you.

552
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:47,243
Do you have a patient named
Ann Merai Harrison?

553
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:49,279
I really can't tell you that.

554
00:45:49,379 --> 00:45:52,075
You can tell me.
Was she your patient or not?

555
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,183
Was she your patient or not?

556
00:45:56,487 --> 00:45:58,250
Was she your patient or not?

557
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,856
No, I've never had
a patient by that name.

558
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,291
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure, very sure.

559
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:06,853
Yeah, I would know that.

560
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,363
Okay, I'm sorry.

561
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:13,834
That your pen?

562
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,236
- Pen? Yes.
- Do you use it much?

563
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:20,008
No, not very much.

564
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,170
You don't mind if I take it, do you?

565
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:26,410
No, you can have the pen.
Sure. It's yours.

566
00:46:27,818 --> 00:46:30,480
Take it. It's yours.

567
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,163
Right.

568
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:48,928
Right.

569
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:51,269
I know that part. Hang on one sec.

570
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:55,911
Did you get
a checkup or something?

571
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,913
No. Just bad coffee.

572
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:01,075
All right.

573
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,676
No, just tell them
they've got to stop lagging.

574
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,688
We need
those phone records now.

575
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,451
All right. Thanks.

576
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,590
- You all right?
- Yeah.

577
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,688
We all good? Fantastic.

578
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:31,847
How's this, ma'am?

579
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,509
You fixed his nose already?
Just wonderful.

580
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,916
Hey, Chief.

581
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:41,481
How you doing, Judy?

582
00:47:41,558 --> 00:47:43,856
I'm fine, thanks, considering...

583
00:47:43,927 --> 00:47:46,725
Alex, we've got
an eyewitness here.

584
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:50,392
Mr. Anderson, this is
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.

585
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,834
Well, just...
We're on top of it.

586
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:56,167
I told them how Judy's mom
saw somebody

587
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:58,537
sneaking around
the Harrison place last night.

588
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:00,941
Got them right over there
sketching it out for us.

589
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,876
...the guy she saw
outside her window...

590
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:04,106
That's her right there?

591
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,207
- Good job.
- Chief, check this out.

592
00:48:09,519 --> 00:48:12,386
Sketch of a prowler out to
the Harrisons' last night. Look.

593
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:15,151
Ring any bells?

594
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:17,159
Hi, Tony.

595
00:48:18,161 --> 00:48:20,629
No. I mean, no.

596
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,095
He looked like him.

597
00:48:25,202 --> 00:48:27,295
- Like who?
- Like him.

598
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,333
- Like me?
- Yeah. You.

599
00:48:36,446 --> 00:48:38,311
Mom, he's the Chief of Police.

600
00:48:39,349 --> 00:48:42,512
- So he was black, ma'am?
- Yeah, he was black.

601
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,283
Wait a minute. Maybe him.

602
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:50,656
Mrs. Anderson, thank you.
Thank you very, very much.

603
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:53,218
Anyway...

604
00:48:53,297 --> 00:48:55,231
I'm so sorry.

605
00:48:55,299 --> 00:48:57,426
Mother was raised
in a different time.

606
00:48:57,501 --> 00:49:00,595
Don't worry about it.
We're on top of it, okay?

607
00:49:00,704 --> 00:49:03,298
- I need to talk to you.
- I appreciate you coming down.

608
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,967
I am so embarrassed.

609
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:09,638
Please, you've got to stop.

610
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,342
I want you to take this
up to Miami for me, okay?

611
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,443
I want you to give it
to a Detective Gissen.

612
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,112
- Gissen?
- Gissen, right.

613
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:22,147
I'm going to give you his number.
I need prints on that ASAP.

614
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,659
- Is it for this thing?
- Yeah.

615
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:27,219
- Excuse me, Chief.
- Yeah.

616
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,061
An Agent Stark from the DEA
is on line one for you.

617
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,122
Who?

618
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:34,227
Agent Stark.
Said it's about the Scarcetti case.

619
00:49:40,243 --> 00:49:41,710
Thank you.

620
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:46,571
Chief Whitlock.

621
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:49,084
Agent Stark, DEA.
How you doing?

622
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,518
- Busy.
- You and me both, pal.

623
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:55,786
I understand you guys are holding
evidence in the Scarcetti case.

624
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,851
Great. That makes you
my new best friend.

625
00:49:59,930 --> 00:50:03,593
I'm going to send some agents
this aftemoon to pick up that cash.

626
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:07,763
We think it was used last year
in a sting operation with Paolo Estaban.

627
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:10,533
If we can tie the serial numbers
to the bills you guys have,

628
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:12,437
we can tie Estaban to Scarcetti.

629
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,602
This is a top priority
for us, Chief.

630
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,271
With this evidence, we can
kill two birds with one stone,

631
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,679
nail Estaban and Scarcetti.

632
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,913
Why don't I call you tomorrow,
and we figure out a time--

633
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,420
This had to be done
the day before yesterday.

634
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,081
We've got a court date next week.

635
00:50:27,157 --> 00:50:30,752
The evidence has to stay with me
until the appeals process is over.

636
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,318
I didn't call you to get a lecture
on the rules of evidence.

637
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:38,027
We need to check the serial numbers,
and that's what we're going to do.

638
00:50:38,101 --> 00:50:40,433
When I hang up on you
in ten seconds,

639
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,267
I want you to type up
a chain of evidence receipt.

640
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,865
One of my men will be happy
to sign it for you this aftemoon.

641
00:50:46,977 --> 00:50:49,411
- Oh, yeah, and, Chief...
- Yeah?

642
00:50:49,479 --> 00:50:50,878
It's been ten seconds.

643
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,349
Chief, you okay?

644
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,016
Yeah. Fine.

645
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:07,621
Just tell Gissen that I need
those prints really quick.

646
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,665
I'm sure Alex can--

647
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,633
We don't want to give them to Alex.

648
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:14,295
- Sorry. I just thought--
- Just do it!

649
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,906
All right. Okay.

650
00:51:18,975 --> 00:51:21,409
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

651
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:25,471
Just go there, stay there,
and call me as soon as they're done.

652
00:51:25,549 --> 00:51:26,811
You got it.

653
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,662
No, I've been on hold.
When should I call back?

654
00:51:41,331 --> 00:51:42,764
Okay. Thanks.

655
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,102
Here you go.

656
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:55,268
Baste, my phone records!

657
00:51:55,378 --> 00:51:57,846
How long can it take to fax over
a few sheets of paper?

658
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:59,813
I'll call them again.

659
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:04,650
- Alex, I think we got something here.
- What?

660
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,417
Look at this entry
into the checkbook, that last one.

661
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,528
- Is this the only entry you found?
- So far, but it's a new register.

662
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,530
What's going on?

663
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:18,694
They got a life insurance policy,
and we've got a potential murder.

664
00:52:18,768 --> 00:52:23,228
Shit, there's got to be tons of these
life insurance companies, right?

665
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:24,364
Right.

666
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:26,738
- You got any pull at the bank?
- Sure.

667
00:52:26,810 --> 00:52:29,745
- You want me to get an address?
- Please.

668
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,913
Sharlene, you know
that report I gave you?

669
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,667
They're not going to be able
to run them for another half an hour.

670
00:52:54,771 --> 00:52:56,705
Call me when you've got something.

671
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:59,640
- T.
- Shit.

672
00:52:59,709 --> 00:53:01,404
You should see the rack

673
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,844
on this chick
that just walked by.

674
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,905
- Just call me.
- Oh, my God.

675
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:18,528
- Those my phone records?
- No, just a fax for me.

676
00:53:18,595 --> 00:53:21,428
Baste, what's up with my fax?
It's not here.

677
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,728
- She said she sent them.
- Who's she?

678
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,597
- Miss White.
- Who's Miss White?

679
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:28,763
She's a supervisor over there.
I've dealt with her before.

680
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,499
Call Miss White back.
They're not here.

681
00:53:30,607 --> 00:53:33,041
I talked to her
a couple of minutes ago.

682
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,133
Detective...

683
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,475
Well, she assured me
that she sent them.

684
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,310
We need to call her back

685
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:42,681
and actually have her wait
as we see the fax coming through.

686
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,987
Sure, boss. Be happy to.

687
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,797
Miss White?

688
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,730
This is Detective Baste
with Miami-Dade.

689
00:53:57,801 --> 00:54:01,237
Yeah, I just spoke to you
about the Harrison phone records.

690
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,306
I haven't received them yet.

691
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,704
What do you mean
you sent them?

692
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,505
I'm staring at the fax machine,
and it's not there.

693
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,773
I'm going to stand right in front of it.

694
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,838
If I don't hear the phone ring
in 30 seconds,

695
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,180
I'm going to your superiors.

696
00:54:15,252 --> 00:54:17,379
Do I need to be more clear than that?

697
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,183
Can I use your computer for a sec?

698
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,450
Couple of minutes.

699
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:23,117
He just e-mailed me a bunch
of warrants I need to look up.

700
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:26,060
- 60 seconds.
- I'm not raising my voice!

701
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,910
You got writer's block.

702
00:54:41,978 --> 00:54:44,310
No, just working on my report.

703
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:46,941
On what?
On somebody jaywalking?

704
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,918
Yeah, someone was jaywalking,
or urinating on the sidewalk,

705
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:52,250
or throwing spitballs
at a crossing guard.

706
00:54:52,322 --> 00:54:54,119
It's a small office, but it's my office.

707
00:54:54,190 --> 00:54:56,055
Phone records coming in.

708
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:02,823
- Is this it?
- It says "receiving."

709
00:55:09,105 --> 00:55:10,663
Oh, shit. It's out of paper.

710
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:15,040
You're kidding me. Oh, God.
Could we get some paper, Sharlene?

711
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:17,875
Anybody got any paper? Paper, folks!

712
00:55:17,947 --> 00:55:22,111
Don't all move at once.
Anybody in Banyan Key have paper?

713
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:24,085
It's about 8 1/2 by 1 1 inches...

714
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,917
Here you go.

715
00:55:44,641 --> 00:55:46,700
What do you do? "Start"?

716
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,643
Here it comes.

717
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,810
We've got a little problem
with this machine.

718
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,084
It's fine, fine.

719
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,679
Great. Thank you.

720
00:56:00,757 --> 00:56:02,520
Let me just get over here.

721
00:56:05,428 --> 00:56:06,793
I hate this thing.

722
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:10,359
Here.

723
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:13,734
There we go. "Start."

724
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,862
There we go.

725
00:56:20,343 --> 00:56:22,641
- I can't read this.
- It's the toner.

726
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,272
- Have her re-fax it.
- It's okay.

727
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:28,249
- I can read it. It's okay.
- No, fax it again.

728
00:56:28,318 --> 00:56:30,343
That says Barry Thomas.

729
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:33,014
A friend of Chris' from high school.
I know him.

730
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:36,320
- That one is Will Blount.
- You guys okay?

731
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:37,587
It's okay.

732
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:40,754
This one is Frank Rhodes.

733
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:43,828
No. All the boxes go to Miami.

734
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:47,996
So the last call they made was
to American Airlines at 8 p.m.

735
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:50,471
Hey. Got a surprise for you.

736
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,532
Both of them already dead when
somebody turned them into s'mores.

737
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:55,339
- What?
- Both of them?

738
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:57,504
No sign of smoke in their lungs.

739
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,014
If they'd been alive
when that place went up,

740
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:01,812
their lungs would look like mine.

741
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:05,483
Alex, here are
the cell phone records.

742
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:06,544
Cell phone?

743
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,387
They're on a different database
than the land lines.

744
00:57:09,459 --> 00:57:11,324
"Town of Banyan Key."

745
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,763
"1 2:34 a.m."

746
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:18,028
305-555-01 99?

747
00:57:20,403 --> 00:57:23,201
What time did grandma say
she saw that prowler?

748
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:24,399
After "Leno."

749
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:27,635
What time's "Leno" over?
Like 1 2:00, 1 2:30?

750
00:57:27,744 --> 00:57:28,711
Hello?

751
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,837
This might be our guy.

752
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:33,006
How many phone calls
do you get after midnight?

753
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,708
Must be a bad connection.

754
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:38,618
All right. 555-0199.

755
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,090
Come on, come on.

756
00:57:53,703 --> 00:57:57,400
Yeah. Okay. Let me see
if I can find the number for you.

757
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:01,603
I don't knowwho it is.

758
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:05,144
The Nextel subscriber
you are trying to reach

759
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:07,877
is outside the service area.
Please try again later.

760
00:58:08,718 --> 00:58:11,050
No, I don't have it.

761
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,588
Whoever it is works
for the town of Banyan Key.

762
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,817
How do we find out
whose phone this is?

763
00:58:15,892 --> 00:58:18,759
- All right, I'll...
- Just ask.

764
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,796
Is there anybody
even in Banyan Key?

765
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:23,389
Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

766
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:28,932
Hey, Alex?

767
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:33,066
I'm sorry, I was drifting off there.
What'd you say that number was?

768
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,110
555-01 99.

769
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,669
01 99?

770
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,680
You're sure it's not 1 099?

771
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,683
Chae, 01 99.

772
00:58:41,751 --> 00:58:45,517
01 99? That's weird.
That's my cell phone number.

773
00:58:45,588 --> 00:58:47,283
Yours?

774
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:49,325
- Yeah.
- Aren't you County?

775
00:58:49,392 --> 00:58:52,953
I work part-time as a paramedic--
football games, school stuff.

776
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:55,020
And you called him last night?

777
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,066
I don't know.
Did l...?

778
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:00,665
Oh, Jesus,
I did call him last night.

779
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,598
I called him from the bar.

780
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:06,665
I wanted to see if he wanted
to have a couple of drinks.

781
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:09,678
- You're friends with him?
- I wouldn't say that.

782
00:59:09,746 --> 00:59:12,647
He's, like,
my bottom-of-the-list guy

783
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:15,206
when you've got to have
somebody to drink with.

784
00:59:15,318 --> 00:59:18,014
I would have mentioned it.
I totally forgot.

785
00:59:18,087 --> 00:59:20,681
You should have told me this
at the scene, Chae.

786
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:24,022
I'm sorry. I don't remember
too much about last night.

787
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:26,721
I had a fight with Barbara.
I was in no good shape.

788
00:59:26,796 --> 00:59:28,991
Check with the bartender--
I closed the place,

789
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,090
staggered home,
passed out next to my wife.

790
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,863
I didn't move until I got the call
to show up at the scene.

791
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,839
I need a statement.

792
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,000
I'll give you a statement
right now.

793
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,939
What's the matter with you?

794
00:59:43,046 --> 00:59:45,947
You're like a love child
of Barney Fife and Joe Friday.

795
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:47,911
All right, a statement.

796
01:00:01,397 --> 01:00:04,059
- What was that about?
- I was sleeping with her.

797
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,328
Jesus.

798
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,029
So you didn't...

799
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,164
No, but it was all a plan,
them coming back here.

800
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,208
They set me up,
planned the whole thing.

801
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,244
What plan?
What do you mean?

802
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:18,814
I gave her the Scarcetti money.

803
01:00:18,881 --> 01:00:20,508
God!

804
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:23,950
Would you have given it to me
if I slept with you?

805
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,919
- Any trace of the money?
- None.

806
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,952
I thought I had trouble
with women.

807
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,657
Maybe you should just tell her.

808
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:37,393
- Who, Alex?
- Yeah. Tell Alex.

809
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,664
Are you out of your mind?
Look what they've got on me.

810
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,831
Motive--Ann Merai names me
beneficiary on her insurance policy,

811
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,498
and I was having an affair with her.

812
01:00:45,608 --> 01:00:47,576
Opportunity--
an eyewitness saw me

813
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,908
outside their house
the night it blew up.

814
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,970
You want to hear some more?

815
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,048
Alibi.

816
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,707
Home, by myself.

817
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,651
That good? At least you
changed your cell phone number.

818
01:00:57,720 --> 01:00:59,881
Even if Alex
wanted to believe me,

819
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:02,686
there's so much evidence
against me, she'd have to turn me in.

820
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:04,488
You're right.

821
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:06,858
That'd kill any chance
of getting back together.

822
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,089
What?

823
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,632
She says,
"Let's call the divorce off."

824
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:14,659
What are you talking about?
I'm looking at murder charges.

825
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:17,365
The gal's a peach. I don't know
what you were thinking.

826
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,907
Never mind. Forget it.

827
01:01:20,243 --> 01:01:21,471
Can I do anything?

828
01:01:21,577 --> 01:01:23,841
You don't think
obstruction of justice is enough?

829
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,813
I'm on a roll.

830
01:01:26,716 --> 01:01:28,081
Chief Whitlock.

831
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:29,709
They matched the prints
on the pen.

832
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:32,880
The guy's name is Paul Cabot.
He's done time before.

833
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:35,048
They got his prints
from a criminal database.

834
01:01:35,124 --> 01:01:36,682
You got an address?

835
01:01:36,759 --> 01:01:40,718
Yeah. 36 ReefRoad, in Kendall.

836
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,153
All right, come on.

837
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:13,227
Hurry up.

838
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,839
- You want a beer?
- Nah, I'm okay.

839
01:03:05,314 --> 01:03:07,282
What tangled webs we weave...

840
01:03:07,350 --> 01:03:08,612
What you got?

841
01:03:08,684 --> 01:03:12,484
Your doctor worked at the hospital,
but seems he was in my line of work.

842
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:14,079
Son of a gun.

843
01:03:14,157 --> 01:03:15,784
Let's get out of here.

844
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:18,156
- Let me get the beer.
- Come on, let's go.

845
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:19,717
I've got to get the beer.

846
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:23,232
A beer in the hand
is worth two in the fridge.

847
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:36,635
What are you doing?

848
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:40,546
Bottom of the ninth.
Down by a lot of runs.

849
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,517
I got about ten grand in the bank.

850
01:03:43,586 --> 01:03:46,487
Get you down to Costa Rica.
You can scout out boats for us.

851
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,149
You think I'm done?

852
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,993
I appreciate the offer,
but I'm not running.

853
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:54,996
No. The idea was I drive you.

854
01:03:55,064 --> 01:03:59,000
Yeah, you can drive me.
Drive me back to the station.

855
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,228
- All right.
- All right.

856
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,643
Got your insurance company
on the line.

857
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:17,618
That policy number
corresponds to

858
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,155
a $1 million
term life insurance policy

859
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,815
for an Ann Merai Harrison.

860
01:04:21,891 --> 01:04:23,483
Any messages there for me?

861
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:27,825
- Who's the beneficiary?
- Just a moment here.

862
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:37,669
Let's see. Looks like
the beneficiary is listed as...

863
01:04:42,345 --> 01:04:44,336
... Chris Harrison, her husband.

864
01:04:48,584 --> 01:04:50,814
Thank you.
You've been really helpful.

865
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,822
I'm sorry I couldn't be more--
Wait a minute.

866
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:55,824
Wait a minute. I got a note here.

867
01:04:55,892 --> 01:05:01,956
The policy holder requested a form
to change the beneficiary last week.

868
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:03,999
So she changed it?

869
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,728
If she did, it hasn't made it
in the system yet.

870
01:05:06,802 --> 01:05:09,464
So what does that mean?
Is that in the mail, or...

871
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,768
It could be downstairs
in our processing center.

872
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,401
Waiting to be processed.
Can you connect me?

873
01:05:14,510 --> 01:05:16,478
I think they're still out to lunch.

874
01:05:16,545 --> 01:05:19,207
All right, so call back
in half an hour?

875
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:20,613
Sure, why not?

876
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:21,877
Thank you.

877
01:05:27,023 --> 01:05:28,320
This is Bill.

878
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:32,452
- How you doing?
- Good. What have you been up to?

879
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:36,664
You've got no idea.
Let me ask you a favor.

880
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:42,432
I've got a Capital One credit card
statement on a Paul Cabot.

881
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:44,939
I need you to find out
the last place he used his card.

882
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,770
I got something for you.

883
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,138
- C-A-B-O-T?
- Yeah.

884
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,644
- Can you hold?
- Yeah. No problem.

885
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,113
I found this under the seat
of one of the Harrison's cars.

886
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:57,414
It's a bank card receipt to a gas station
used by a guy named Paul Cabot.

887
01:05:57,486 --> 01:05:59,818
Nice. Check the phone records.

888
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:01,686
- Already on it.
- Paul Cabot.

889
01:06:01,757 --> 01:06:04,954
Anybody know or ever heard
of a Paul Cabot?

890
01:06:05,027 --> 01:06:07,723
Come on, people, wake up.

891
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:09,890
Yes? No?

892
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,058
No.

893
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,430
Paul Cabot?

894
01:06:12,501 --> 01:06:14,901
Frank, call the bank,
see what they've got.

895
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,270
No records of any incoming
or outgoing calls to a Paul Cabot.

896
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,777
Check every restaurant,
gas station...

897
01:06:21,844 --> 01:06:23,744
- Yeah?
- I've got something.

898
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:27,010
If this guy took a piss
and paid for it, I want to know.

899
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,314
He's got a reservation
at the Costa Coral Hotel.

900
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:33,355
- There's a hold on it now?
- Checked in yesterday.

901
01:06:33,422 --> 01:06:35,481
- Costa Coral Hotel.
- You know where it is?

902
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,492
- Yeah. On Atlantic Avenue.
- Yeah.

903
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,824
You're a lifesaver.

904
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,063
- Chief Whitlock?
- Yeah.

905
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,903
Agent White.
This is Agent Fetzer.

906
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:56,103
We're here to pick up
the Scarcetti money.

907
01:06:56,212 --> 01:07:00,148
Agent Stark said to send
the money to his office.

908
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:02,012
My guy left five minutes ago.

909
01:07:02,084 --> 01:07:05,349
- He told you we'd pick it up.
- He said send it to his office.

910
01:07:05,421 --> 01:07:07,480
He told you to send
the money to the office?

911
01:07:07,556 --> 01:07:08,750
He'll tell you.

912
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,815
- Let me talk to him.
- He wants to talk to you.

913
01:07:13,362 --> 01:07:16,957
What the hell is your problem?
I told you to get that money ready,

914
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:18,933
- that I was sending agents--
- You said--

915
01:07:19,001 --> 01:07:21,196
What are you, a parrot,
telling me what I said?

916
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,601
I know what I said.

917
01:07:22,671 --> 01:07:25,469
No, I'm not a parrot.
I know what you said.

918
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:27,371
Then where the hell is the money?

919
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:31,708
If you shut up for five minutes,
I can tell you where the money is.

920
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:35,349
I sent the money to your office.
My guy just left.

921
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:37,443
He should be up there
in about an hour.

922
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:40,546
If you have a problem with that
after I hang up in ten seconds,

923
01:07:40,623 --> 01:07:43,148
call your partners at the lRS,
tell them to audit me.

924
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:46,456
- You little bastard!
- Agent Stark.

925
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:47,826
What? What?

926
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,229
- I meant five seconds.
- Damn it, Chief!

927
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:52,859
Sorry, I can't hear you.
You're breaking up.

928
01:07:52,935 --> 01:07:55,802
Can you hear me?

929
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,702
Sorry about your phone.

930
01:07:57,773 --> 01:07:59,263
Can you hear me now?

931
01:08:04,713 --> 01:08:07,181
Costa Coral Hotel.
Good aftemoon.

932
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:11,208
I just checked in to your hotel.
I'm trying to access my voice mail.

933
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,346
- You're not in your room.
- I'm on my cell phone.

934
01:08:13,422 --> 01:08:14,889
Okay, that's no problem.

935
01:08:14,957 --> 01:08:17,858
- Can you help me?
- Sure. What's your room number?

936
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:20,259
I don't remember. I just checked in.

937
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:22,024
- What's your name?
- Paul Cabot.

938
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,087
Please hold.

939
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:27,732
- You're in room 71 5.
- 7 1 5. Okay, thank you.

940
01:08:27,803 --> 01:08:29,327
To access your voice mail...

941
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:32,602
Alex, we got a Paul Cabot
at a Costa Coral Hotel in Miami.

942
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:34,198
It's on Atlantic.

943
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:07,667
- He's supposed to be here already.
- These people work slow.

944
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,869
- Did you get those things?
- Yeah. You got a TV?

945
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,310
Watch pay-per-view.

946
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:14,816
Forget pay-per-view.
You got your wife under control?

947
01:09:14,917 --> 01:09:16,817
Is she cool? She's not gonna...

948
01:09:16,886 --> 01:09:19,946
She's not talking to nobody.
She's not going nowhere.

949
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:22,081
She's got too much to lose.

950
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,557
All right.

951
01:09:23,626 --> 01:09:26,288
Damn, man.
You take a terrible picture.

952
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:28,762
Get yourself over here.
We've gotta get out of town.

953
01:09:28,831 --> 01:09:30,025
Right.

954
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:32,796
Excuse me.
How you doing?

955
01:09:32,868 --> 01:09:38,101
I left my key up in my room.
A knucklehead. 71 5. It's Cabot.

956
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,233
Paul Cabot, 71 5.

957
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:42,276
Happens all the time, Mr. Cabot.

958
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:43,971
Thank you.

959
01:10:15,477 --> 01:10:16,637
Paul?

960
01:10:20,983 --> 01:10:22,746
Paul Cabot, it's the police.

961
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:48,257
403, request
for driver's license info...

962
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:00,840
- There's somebody up there!
- What?

963
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:04,709
There's somebody up there!
Oh, my God!

964
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,010
Where?

965
01:14:27,229 --> 01:14:28,719
See you, Mr. Cabot.

966
01:14:46,482 --> 01:14:48,712
Do you have a Paul Cabot
registered here?

967
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:49,944
Yeah.

968
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:52,418
Someone was pushed off
the seventh-floor balcony!

969
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:54,080
How do you know he was pushed?

970
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:56,852
A man was seen climbing
back into his room.

971
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:00,258
- Calm down, relax.
- Which side of the building was it?

972
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:03,162
That's the guy!
That's him! That's Cabot!

973
01:15:28,824 --> 01:15:30,689
I'll take four. You go upstairs.

974
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,486
- Stop!
- Jesus!

975
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:03,991
Mathias?

976
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:06,189
I pulled in right after you.

977
01:16:06,261 --> 01:16:08,354
- Did he come down?
- Nobody came past me.

978
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,297
- I'll meet you in the lobby.
- In the lobby.

979
01:16:24,313 --> 01:16:27,840
Get these people out of here.
I'm gonna shut down the elevators.

980
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:32,613
It's him!

981
01:16:45,233 --> 01:16:49,363
Police officer. Upstairs!
I'll cover the back!

982
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:59,937
- You got the money?
- Yeah, I got the money.

983
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:02,575
- Where'd you stash it?
- Right behind the seat.

984
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,515
Flight number 601,
non-stop to San Jose.

985
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:08,715
I'm not flying to Costa Rica.
Get off the phone.

986
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:12,157
- I gotta go.
- I'll swing by your house...

987
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:18,897
- Your new girl?
- No.

988
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:22,102
Weren't we supposed
to meet in the lobby?

989
01:17:22,170 --> 01:17:26,231
I just had to get my cell
out of the car, make a call...

990
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:30,745
...to the office, you know,
checking on a lead.

991
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,946
- Let's go back upstairs.
- My boys are on it.

992
01:17:36,618 --> 01:17:39,178
Why don't we go have a talk?

993
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:41,482
Sure.

994
01:17:54,970 --> 01:18:00,374
You got something you want
to tell me or need to tell me?

995
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:01,942
What do you mean?

996
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:08,708
Something that I ought to know,
but that you might not want to say.

997
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:14,051
Congratulations
on making detective.

998
01:18:14,723 --> 01:18:17,351
I'm proud of you.
I never said it, but I am.

999
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:20,361
I know you are.
You don't have to say it.

1000
01:18:21,396 --> 01:18:23,421
That's not what I'm talking about.

1001
01:18:25,434 --> 01:18:27,629
How'd you get to the hotel so fast?

1002
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,499
I heard it on the radio.

1003
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:35,842
So, nothing else you want to say?

1004
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,937
I'm gonna sign those divorce papers.

1005
01:18:39,047 --> 01:18:43,040
- I'm not talking--
- I'll get to it. I just haven't...

1006
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:45,483
- Believe me, I'll sign 'em.
- It's cool.

1007
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,419
We're in no hurry.

1008
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:49,814
Are we?

1009
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,620
I'm not.

1010
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:55,855
You knowwhat this place
reminds me of?

1011
01:18:56,732 --> 01:18:59,166
When we first started going out.

1012
01:18:59,234 --> 01:19:02,601
Remember when we used to talk
on the phone for hours?

1013
01:19:02,671 --> 01:19:05,504
And you had this thing.

1014
01:19:05,607 --> 01:19:10,135
You'd say, "Well,
I guess that's everything."

1015
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:14,011
And you'd hang up on me.
And then you'd call right back.

1016
01:19:14,616 --> 01:19:16,243
That's right.

1017
01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,411
What would you say?

1018
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,510
That I love you...

1019
01:19:22,090 --> 01:19:23,557
...very much.

1020
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:29,724
I liked that.

1021
01:19:49,017 --> 01:19:50,143
Come here.

1022
01:19:50,218 --> 01:19:52,652
Come here, you have
something in your hair.

1023
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:56,947
Chief...

1024
01:20:57,018 --> 01:21:00,317
These are from Agent Stark.
He sounded kind of pissed.

1025
01:21:00,388 --> 01:21:01,946
See you tomorrow, okay?

1026
01:21:02,023 --> 01:21:04,116
Detective, the hotel called.

1027
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:06,752
The clerk's on his way
from the hospital.

1028
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:08,056
Detective?

1029
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:11,826
Call the insurance company, see if they
found out who the beneficiary is yet.

1030
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,959
You got it.

1031
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:35,382
- City Hall.
- Hi. Accounting, please.

1032
01:21:35,457 --> 01:21:37,687
Sure, let me get
that number for you.

1033
01:21:37,759 --> 01:21:40,853
I'm sorry, they've gone
home for the day.

1034
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:43,625
- Of course they have. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1035
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:48,266
Alex, did Cabot make any
phone calls from his hotel?

1036
01:21:48,336 --> 01:21:49,928
We're waiting on them.

1037
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:51,563
Okay.

1038
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:55,602
Chief, the hotel called.
They left a message.

1039
01:21:56,845 --> 01:22:00,110
The clerk left half an hour ago.
He should be here any minute.

1040
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:04,316
Great.

1041
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:20,925
Whitlock.

1042
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:26,134
- Hello?
- Matt...

1043
01:22:27,876 --> 01:22:31,141
Matt, I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1044
01:22:31,212 --> 01:22:33,237
I'm so sorry.

1045
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:35,908
It was never...

1046
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:37,645
This is a surprise.

1047
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:42,656
There's so much
I have to tell you.

1048
01:22:42,724 --> 01:22:44,988
I need to...

1049
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,018
You got a lot of people
worried about you, Ann.

1050
01:22:48,096 --> 01:22:49,222
I know.

1051
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:51,356
We all had the funny idea
that you were dead.

1052
01:22:53,068 --> 01:22:55,832
I'm sorry, Matt.
I'm so sorry.

1053
01:22:55,904 --> 01:22:58,464
- I'm so sorry.
- Where's Chris?

1054
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,532
Oh, God, I've lied to you
so much.

1055
01:23:01,643 --> 01:23:03,235
He forced me to do this.

1056
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:07,645
He and his friend Paul found out
about the Scarcetti thing.

1057
01:23:07,716 --> 01:23:09,684
They stole bodies from the morgue.

1058
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:13,016
- You switched the dental records.
- I had to.

1059
01:23:13,088 --> 01:23:17,218
I had to.
They said they'd kill me.

1060
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,826
See, Paul was a criminal, Matt.

1061
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:22,522
- He was?
- Yes.

1062
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:24,588
He was killed today.

1063
01:23:25,834 --> 01:23:28,098
They made me do this.

1064
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:32,306
Now it looks like
you and I faked my death

1065
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:34,842
to collect on the insurance policy.

1066
01:23:37,912 --> 01:23:40,176
So what do you want me to do?

1067
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:42,182
I don't want to
have to face them

1068
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:44,684
and have to answer
questions about this.

1069
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:48,052
I gotta get out of town,
but I don't know where to go.

1070
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,990
And I need money.

1071
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:53,557
So where's Chris?

1072
01:23:55,430 --> 01:23:58,866
You're right.
I should have come to you earlier.

1073
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:00,332
He's there, isn't he?

1074
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:01,892
Yes.

1075
01:24:05,106 --> 01:24:07,267
I would have contacted you earlier,

1076
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,502
but I knew you would think
it was another trick.

1077
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:12,739
I don't blame you.
He beat me up and...

1078
01:24:14,849 --> 01:24:17,215
- Matt?
- Yeah.

1079
01:24:18,720 --> 01:24:21,211
He beat me up and...

1080
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:25,153
- See, Paul had the money--
- I have the money.

1081
01:24:26,928 --> 01:24:31,092
No, I don't want to involve you
in any more of this.

1082
01:24:31,166 --> 01:24:32,690
Where are you?

1083
01:24:32,767 --> 01:24:35,827
I'm here at the old boat.

1084
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:37,394
Stay there. I'll meet you.

1085
01:24:46,381 --> 01:24:50,408
I've interviewed her twice already,
and it does match up.

1086
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:17,408
- Neil, Detective Diaz-Whitlock.
- Hi.

1087
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:19,913
- Ouch. How you feeling?
- I'm okay.

1088
01:25:19,981 --> 01:25:22,245
You're up for answering
a few questions? Yeah?

1089
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:24,877
You need anything else?
This way.

1090
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:33,892
All right, take a seat to your left.

1091
01:25:34,496 --> 01:25:36,088
Here you go.

1092
01:25:36,164 --> 01:25:39,395
- Where's Chief Whitlock?
- I don't know. Bathroom, maybe.

1093
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:42,493
Alex, insurance company, line two.

1094
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:43,935
Detective Diaz-Whitlock.

1095
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:47,771
Detective, I got your beneficiary.
It's a Mathias Lee Whitlock.

1096
01:25:49,077 --> 01:25:50,544
Thank you.

1097
01:26:24,946 --> 01:26:28,643
Agent Stark, DEA.
I'm looking for Chief Whitlock.

1098
01:26:41,596 --> 01:26:44,258
- How much was it?
- 485,000.

1099
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:47,527
Did he arrange to have it
picked up or dropped off?

1100
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:51,094
He told my agents he was sending it
to my office. Nobody showed.

1101
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:52,867
I'm sure it was
just miscommunication.

1102
01:30:23,618 --> 01:30:25,643
That's a.38, Chris.

1103
01:30:27,321 --> 01:30:29,118
Only six shots.

1104
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,913
Give me the gun.
Give me the gun!

1105
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,004
He's gone.

1106
01:31:28,716 --> 01:31:30,183
You all right?

1107
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:34,581
Give me the gun.

1108
01:31:34,655 --> 01:31:36,179
Wait a minute.

1109
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:41,092
You said he beat you up.
It was self-defense.

1110
01:31:41,162 --> 01:31:44,188
No jury would convict you.
Just put the gun down.

1111
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:46,859
You think Chris
did this to my face?

1112
01:31:51,138 --> 01:31:54,437
I think you should
put your gun on the floor.

1113
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:57,168
What?

1114
01:31:57,278 --> 01:32:01,715
Put it down. I didn't think
I could do this, but I will.

1115
01:32:06,721 --> 01:32:08,655
You set this up.

1116
01:32:08,723 --> 01:32:11,556
- Put your gun on the floor.
- Are you sure?

1117
01:32:19,567 --> 01:32:21,364
Don't do this.

1118
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,404
Where's the money?

1119
01:32:24,472 --> 01:32:26,531
Come on. Jesus!

1120
01:32:48,663 --> 01:32:50,187
So you...

1121
01:32:51,332 --> 01:32:54,062
We didn't mean anything
to each other?

1122
01:32:54,835 --> 01:32:56,996
- It's not important.
- That's not important now.

1123
01:32:57,071 --> 01:33:00,041
- It was just all an act?
- Where's the money?

1124
01:33:00,041 --> 01:33:03,568
Look me in the eye and tell me
you didn't mean any of it.

1125
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:06,238
Some of it!
Don't try to confuse me!

1126
01:33:06,347 --> 01:33:09,578
- I don't have any choice now.
- You don't have to do this.

1127
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:11,982
I've known you all your life.
You're not a criminal.

1128
01:33:12,053 --> 01:33:14,715
- You know I know you--
- Stop!

1129
01:33:24,632 --> 01:33:26,065
What?!

1130
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:30,535
Okay. All right,
high-school sweetheart.

1131
01:33:30,605 --> 01:33:33,403
You think I'm playing?
I'm not playing.

1132
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:35,906
Damn!

1133
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,275
- I was aiming for your arm.
- Well, you missed!

1134
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,076
- Where is it?
- Outside the door.

1135
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:43,742
- Show me!
- All right.

1136
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,912
Just calm down. Just wait a minute.

1137
01:33:46,988 --> 01:33:51,448
Just wait. Don't shoot me.
I'm just gonna reach for it.

1138
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:52,856
Show me!

1139
01:33:54,328 --> 01:33:56,387
- Here it is.
- Put it down.

1140
01:33:57,598 --> 01:34:00,226
- Wait, don't shoot me.
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1141
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:03,896
I'm the one that got you the money.
I'm trying to save your life.

1142
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:13,772
It wasn't all an act. I can't live broke.
Life ain't shit when you're broke.

1143
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,417
- Shit!
- Wait!

1144
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,680
Wait, no!

1145
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:32,365
Oh, my God.

1146
01:34:35,403 --> 01:34:38,634
- Anyone else up here?
- No.

1147
01:34:49,950 --> 01:34:51,417
How'd you find me?

1148
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:03,125
- Are you hit?
- No, I'm okay.

1149
01:35:03,197 --> 01:35:04,687
I'm all right.

1150
01:35:10,838 --> 01:35:14,399
It's Alex. Get me an ambulance
and a med examiner.

1151
01:35:14,508 --> 01:35:18,877
No, I'm fine. I'm at the end
of Runyon Road on the dock.

1152
01:35:18,946 --> 01:35:20,277
Hurry.

1153
01:35:23,951 --> 01:35:25,441
Did you kill Paul Cabot?

1154
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:28,849
No...

1155
01:35:28,923 --> 01:35:31,949
It was self-defense.
He was attacking me.

1156
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:33,857
I was trying
to get the money back.

1157
01:35:33,928 --> 01:35:36,863
You were just gonna
hand the money back?

1158
01:35:37,898 --> 01:35:42,858
- That's what I was trying to do.
- Then what's that over there?

1159
01:36:28,682 --> 01:36:29,876
What do you got?

1160
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:32,510
Chris and Ann Harrison's
bodies are upstairs.

1161
01:36:32,586 --> 01:36:33,917
The real ones.

1162
01:36:35,055 --> 01:36:36,955
They were both working for Cabot.

1163
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:40,755
Chief found out they were here
and took care of business, right?

1164
01:36:42,329 --> 01:36:43,455
Right.

1165
01:36:43,531 --> 01:36:45,999
- Let's move.
- Good job.

1166
01:36:46,066 --> 01:36:47,761
Thank you.

1167
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:53,398
Thank you very much.

1168
01:36:55,810 --> 01:36:58,040
Your guy never
showed up, Whitlock.

1169
01:36:59,079 --> 01:37:00,979
Agent Stark?

1170
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:02,208
Yeah.

1171
01:37:03,350 --> 01:37:05,409
I don't care
if you're injured or not.

1172
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:09,923
I want that evidence money, or you're
gonna be looking at a case--

1173
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:13,448
Where the hell is Southeast
63rd Street in Miami?

1174
01:37:13,527 --> 01:37:17,486
53rd Street. I told you
53rd Street, not 63rd.

1175
01:37:17,565 --> 01:37:18,930
- No, you did not.
- Yes, I did.

1176
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:20,728
I said Southeast 53rd--

1177
01:37:20,801 --> 01:37:22,701
You said,
"Those assholes in the DEA

1178
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:25,568
are at 8400
Southeast 63rd Street."

1179
01:37:25,639 --> 01:37:27,300
I didn't. I'm very sorry.

1180
01:37:27,408 --> 01:37:29,842
What I said was,
"Those assholes from the DEA

1181
01:37:29,910 --> 01:37:33,778
are at 8400 Southeast 53rd."

1182
01:37:33,848 --> 01:37:35,941
- 63rd.
- Never mind.

1183
01:37:36,016 --> 01:37:38,416
Just give them the money.
Give them the money.

1184
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,751
You don't have to count it.
It's all there. Have a safe ride home.

1185
01:37:47,127 --> 01:37:49,061
- Come on.
- Assholes.

1186
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:54,492
- It is all there, right?
- Most of it.

1187
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:56,866
It's all there.

1188
01:37:58,072 --> 01:38:00,734
That's a pretty good one.
Nice touch.

1189
01:38:00,841 --> 01:38:02,138
A little over the top.

1190
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:03,505
- Which part?
- Your part.

1191
01:38:03,611 --> 01:38:06,171
You're the one
that came in here screaming.

1192
01:38:06,280 --> 01:38:07,679
What happened to you, man?

1193
01:38:07,748 --> 01:38:10,717
Just never leave your wife.
That's what happened to me.

1194
01:38:12,119 --> 01:38:13,484
I'd take the bullet.

1195
01:38:14,488 --> 01:38:19,187
Be careful there. It's a classic.
That grille work comes from France.

1196
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,788
- How you feeling? Excuse us.
- Yes, ma'am.

1197
01:38:24,932 --> 01:38:26,422
Did you love her?

1198
01:38:28,602 --> 01:38:29,899
No.

1199
01:38:31,405 --> 01:38:33,703
Why would you do this, then?

1200
01:38:35,442 --> 01:38:36,739
Because I'm...

1201
01:38:38,812 --> 01:38:41,975
Because I'm stupid.
Because...

1202
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:46,543
I thought I was doing the right thing,
trying to help her, but it's no excuse.

1203
01:38:46,620 --> 01:38:52,718
Sometimes people,
you know, do stupid things.

1204
01:38:54,762 --> 01:38:57,788
Especially when they're still in love.

1205
01:39:07,808 --> 01:39:09,275
Thank you.

1206
01:39:09,343 --> 01:39:10,469
Let's go.

1207
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:08,858
How you doing?
I thought you were Chae.

1208
01:40:08,936 --> 01:40:10,801
He called all worked up
about something.

1209
01:40:12,106 --> 01:40:13,596
Okay.

1210
01:40:13,674 --> 01:40:16,609
- You want to sit down?
- Yeah.

1211
01:40:26,887 --> 01:40:28,878
- How you doing?
- Good.

1212
01:40:28,956 --> 01:40:31,322
- I asked that already?
- Yes. I said I was good.

1213
01:40:31,392 --> 01:40:33,883
- You want a beer?
- Yes.

1214
01:40:35,329 --> 01:40:39,197
I don't have any left.
You can share mine, though.

1215
01:40:41,335 --> 01:40:43,667
So what brings you out this way?

1216
01:40:43,737 --> 01:40:46,501
I just needed to move
the rest of my stuff.

1217
01:40:48,442 --> 01:40:50,706
That's cool, I guess.

1218
01:40:52,279 --> 01:40:53,803
The house is a mess.

1219
01:40:55,049 --> 01:40:57,745
This came for you at the station.

1220
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:02,048
You opened it?
You opened my mail?

1221
01:41:02,122 --> 01:41:04,647
- Why you always opening my mail?
- Just read it.

1222
01:41:05,225 --> 01:41:07,125
They just want you
to fill out the forms.

1223
01:41:07,194 --> 01:41:09,059
"To claim amount payable
to the beneficiary

1224
01:41:09,129 --> 01:41:11,529
for the sum of $1 million."

1225
01:41:12,332 --> 01:41:15,893
- What?
- We're rich.

1226
01:41:15,969 --> 01:41:18,403
We're rich.
How about that?

1227
01:41:18,472 --> 01:41:20,770
- $1 million.
- Easy, Chae.

1228
01:41:20,874 --> 01:41:24,366
- He can't take that money.
- I can't take the money?

1229
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:27,675
- Why not?
- It's a conflict of interest.

1230
01:41:27,748 --> 01:41:31,149
- He's the legal beneficiary.
- I am the legal beneficiary.

1231
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:33,413
And he's one of
the arresting officers.

1232
01:41:33,487 --> 01:41:36,115
What the hell's that
got to do with anything?

1233
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:39,284
Tell him how much trouble
you can get in.

1234
01:41:39,359 --> 01:41:43,386
It's a million bucks!
It's the chance of a lifetime! No!

1235
01:41:44,698 --> 01:41:47,929
As his wife, I'm telling you
he's not taking that money.

1236
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:51,402
- As my wife?
- As your wife.

1237
01:41:52,606 --> 01:41:54,096
Come on.

1238
01:41:54,775 --> 01:41:56,834
Come on, don't fall for that.

1239
01:41:56,944 --> 01:41:59,970
- What do you mean, as my wife?
- As your wife.

1240
01:42:00,047 --> 01:42:02,982
You said you came
to move your stuff.

1241
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:05,313
I'm moving back in.

1242
01:42:05,385 --> 01:42:08,218
This is great. Congratulations.
It's kind of fortuitous.

1243
01:42:08,288 --> 01:42:10,119
- You serious?
- Yeah.

1244
01:42:10,190 --> 01:42:11,953
Are you gonna behave?

1245
01:42:12,025 --> 01:42:14,789
I'm actually afraid
to leave you by yourself.

1246
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:17,296
You won the sweepstakes, man.

1247
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:21,062
You can do this later.
It's a million bucks.

1248
01:42:21,135 --> 01:42:22,932
Let's not lose focus.

1249
01:42:23,003 --> 01:42:27,064
You know, a honeymoon fund,
a nursery wing for the...

1250
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:32,344
This is the golden pot
at the end of the storm thing!

1251
01:42:34,047 --> 01:42:36,641
Just sign it before you go in, huh?

1252
01:42:38,218 --> 01:42:39,845
I'm not gonna let you
do this to yourself.

1253
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,480
I'm gonna be sitting out here
when you're finished.

1254
01:42:42,556 --> 01:42:45,582
I can wait three minutes.
I'm a patient man.

1255
01:42:45,659 --> 01:42:47,593
I am a patient man.

1256
01:42:47,661 --> 01:42:49,492
Come on!
