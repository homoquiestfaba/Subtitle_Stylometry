1
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:07,198
Today we have entering the
ring, we have number 33,

2
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,352
Nicole Carlile on Obie.

3
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,953
We have number 40, Katie

Wydeman on Faithful Strider,

4
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,951
and number 32, Sarah Good on lnga,

5
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,428
I just got an advisory,
and the advisory says:

6
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,469
Please be advised, there might
be a pick pocket on the loose,

7
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,435
So please watch your wallet

8
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,230
Better watch your purse hon.

9
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,596
Yeah, very funny. Have you seen Eric?

10
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,110
Hi look, there's Sarah!

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,834
Hi Sarah!

12
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,038
Hi.

13
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,435
I hope she does well. She's been
looking forward to this for weeks,

14
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:56,438
She's going to do great.
Look at her,

15
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,753
You r dad is a looser

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,956
Don't cal I my dad a loser, you jerk!

17
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
Oh, no. Eric.

18
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,918
I call your dad whatever I want to,

19
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,920
I dare you!

20
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,194
Just wait, my dad is a lawyer.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,035
Hey you guys, cut it out!

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,680
Sarah, we need to go over the show,

23
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,033
OK,

24
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Hey, Sarah! Sorry about that fight.

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,510
Keep yourself in one piece, Eric, OK?

26
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,120
Yeah, you too. Good luck!

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,872
Thanks.

28
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,319
We should have paid our respects
to the old woman. She deserved that,

29
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,833
She deserved nothing. That old
witch took her secret to the grave.

30
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,916
I feel sorry for Tor,

31
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,789
Tor brought this upon himself, But
he won't be able to stop me anymore,

32
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,031
Doesn't matter anyway.
I'll just buy the estate,

33
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:01,159
Then Fjordheim and the
mine will make us rich!

34
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,752
I heard that she has an heir.

35
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,116
And number 32, Sarah Good on lnga,

36
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,714
Gudrun Schillingmeyer,
You came from the earth,

37
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,400
You're going back to the earth.

38
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,672
And from the earth
you shall raise again.

39
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,354
Alright, one more,
one more, keep going.

40
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,875
Sarah? Sarah?

41
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,439
Mom?

42
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,040
Oh, Sarah, thank Goodness!

43
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,032
Hi honey, how are you feeling?

44
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,478
My head really hurts.

45
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,875
Don't worry about that.
You're going to be just fine.

46
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,716
OK Sarah Good, how are you feeling?

47
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,518
Like I've been run
over by a Mack truck.

48
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,118
That's not so strange,
you got a concussion.

49
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:01,149
But according to the x-rays,
everything else is fine,

50
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,398
I'd like to keep you for one more night
- just for observation.

51
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,154
And if everything checks
out, you can go home tomorrow.

52
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,760
And when can I ride again?

53
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,877
As soon as you feel
better, But take it easy.

54
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,392
Just push that button
if you need anything,

55
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,949
Thanks doctor.

56
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,951
I was afraid he would tell me l
wouldn't be able to ride anymore,

57
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,109
You really scared us today honey,

58
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,870
It might not be a bad idea to
take it easy for a while? OK?

59
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,793
Hi, Sarah!

60
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,631
Hi, Susan.

61
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,075
Are you ready to ride again?

62
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,434
Oh yeah!

63
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,835
She's going to take it a little
easy at first though. Right?

64
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:22,155
Yeah. How's Inga doing?

65
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,393
Oh, she's doing great, why don't
you come and see for yourself,

66
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,473
How is she doing?

67
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,831
She is doing OK.

68
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,080
Inga is in excellent shape.
She's been missing you Sarah,

69
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,957
She looks great!

70
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,799
What's wrong Sarah?

71
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,353
I have to go!

72
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,394
Sarah! Sarah!

73
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,239
What's going on with me?

74
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,200
Maybe you just need some time,

75
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,320
You don't have to get right
up back on the horse, It's OK.

76
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,993
Mom, I won't just give up.

77
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,313
I'm going back tomorrow and I'm
going to get back up on lnga,

78
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,514
This is something that
is just going to pass.

79
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,199
Yeah.

80
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:00,670
Dad's going to start the windmill
again. Come on, Sarah, let's go see!

81
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,198
I better go help dad,

82
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,152
That's not a bad idea.

83
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,355
That windmill.

84
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,720
This looks really scary, dad,

85
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,800
Not if you know what you're doing.

86
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,078
When this baby works, it will
cut our electricity bills in half,

87
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,553
Do you need any help?

88
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,280
Yeah, why don't you
guys run out to the yard.

89
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,510
When I give the signal
- pull the clutch for the dynamo,

90
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,039
I'm on it.

91
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,157
Dad, mom says I shouldn't ride anymore,

92
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,595
Of course you'll ride.

93
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,991
I just need to check one
last connection here.

94
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,838
Is it windy enough for the windmill?

95
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,200
Dad said it was.

96
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,839
Hey Eric, are you ready!?

97
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,075
I'm ready dad!

98
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,031
Release the handle on my countdown.
Feeling good about this.

99
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,790
Don't you remember
what happened last time?

100
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,110
We fixed that now, Guaranteed

101
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,150
Now!

102
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,628
Ok, here it goes.

103
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,197
I knew it.

104
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:43,280
I'm so tired of this! Are we
going to do this all summer?

105
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,080
Dad, are you OK?

106
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,513
I just got myself a
little fried, That's all,

107
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,516
Dad!

108
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,271
That is the end of the windmill.

109
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,191
But this thing is going to cut
our electricity bills in half,

110
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,511
Yeah, lower the bill

- blow up the house.

111
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,835
Why don't you get a real job instead?

112
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,271
Here watch.

113
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:51,312
Easy, Settle down. Steady girl,..

114
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,797
You're good with horses,

115
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,040
It's not about being good Sarah,

116
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:06,795
It's not about horses
at all. It's about you.

117
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,632
How do you know my
name and who are you?

118
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,555
Sarah, I need to talk to

you. Can you come here please?

119
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,953
You haven't been back on
the horse since the accident,

120
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,599
No.

121
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:29,560
What's going on? Are
you afraid of the horses?

122
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,278
I will ride again!

123
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:34,392
I know you will Sarah, But
listen, I spoke to your mother

124
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,992
and we both agreed you need
to take a break from riding,

125
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,392
You've agreed? What about me?

126
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,240
It is for your own good, ok?

127
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,389
No, it is not!

128
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,669
Yes!

129
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,437
What do you think old girl?

130
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,229
Mom!

131
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:02,554
Yeah, in here

132
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,355
You've been making
agreements behind my back?

133
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,560
Hi Sarah, how are you?

134
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,549
Mom!

135
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,636
Yes Sarah, I had a
talk with your trainer,

136
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,673
How nice for you, mom, that you
agreed on destroying my life for me.

137
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,673
We can't afford this right now,

138
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,189
Especially if you're not
going to ride the horse, honey!

139
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,230
Dinner is served!

140
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,669
I can't stand your dried pizza,

141
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,675
Mom! It's Eric. With the police.

142
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,834
Mrs. Good?

143
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,910
Yes!

144
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,357
I'm sorry to have to tell you
that Eric was brought in today

145
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,873
in connection with a theft.

146
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,996
I didn't do it mom, really!

147
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,394
What kind of theft?

148
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:50,352
A wallet was stolen from a spectator
at the horse fair this last Friday.

149
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,994
And we have reason to believe
that Eric was involved,

150
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,480
A wallet?

151
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,153
Belonging to Barry Lebrowsky,

152
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,477
Eric, could you please come here,

153
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,634
I hope we don't have
to come back again.

154
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,797
Oh no, Thank You very much,

155
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,836
I believe you, Eric.

156
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,598
I'm going to ring that jerk's neck,

157
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,673
And when you do, I'll squash
him and sell him as cat food,

158
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,431
But the cats don't deserve
anything that gross,

159
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,590
It's time for bedtime guys.

160
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,673
All right,

161
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,032
Oooh, Eric,

162
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,519
I didn't do it mom.

163
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:54,115
Yeah, I know you didn't.
Don't worry about that now, OK?

164
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,839
Are you alright mom?

165
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,519
Yeah, I'm a little tired,

166
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,873
I think we're all tired, hah?

We could use a long vacation,

167
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,833
But we can't afford that, can we?

168
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,471
I can get a summer job,

169
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,238
Me too.

170
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,355
No, that's not what I want
you guys to do this summer,

171
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,876
Well, it'll be OK, mom.

172
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:49,877
Yeah, it'll be all right,

173
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,713
Who is that?

174
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,791
I have no idea.

175
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,110
I bet that is Barry Lebrowsky's dad,

176
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,351
Oh, no

177
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:49,750
What are you doing?

178
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,599
Shhhh, Barry Lebrowsky's dad is here.

179
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,150
Let's pretend we're not home.

180
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,755
Good idea! Let's climb
out the kitchen window.

181
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,599
You morons,

182
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:08,634
I'll get it! You can hide here, OK?

183
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,953
Hello?

184
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,718
Sarah Good?

185
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,829
That's me,

186
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,952
How would you like to
receive $300,,000 Sarah?

187
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,194
An older woman in Norway,
Gudrun Schillingmeyer,

188
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,311
died a little over a week ago.

189
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,634
She left a will naming Sarah as
the heiress of her house and estate.

190
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,750
Did I inherit a house in Norway?

191
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:40,275
Norway? I was adopted from Norway?

192
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,677
Wait a minute! When was the funeral?

193
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,393
That would be.., last Friday,

194
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,632
But that's when I fell off the horse!

195
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,920
So, this house could be
from my biological family,

196
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,832
I have an offer for you
and your family, Sarah,

197
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,353
My client, Lars Storhaug, wants
to buy the property for $300,000,

198
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,670
$300,000?

199
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,236
It must be said that
this is a very old house,

200
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,798
Not exactly the sort of place where
you want to live if I may say so,

201
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,509
The offer from my
client is very generous.

202
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,712
It's all here in these documents,

203
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,629
Let me know when you are ready to sign

204
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,960
and we'll take care of it
quickly and efficiently,

205
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,840
Hi, what's going on?

206
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,068
Ahm, this is....

207
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,717
Hi man, Mr, Vogelman,

208
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,877
I just presented your husband
and daughter with an offer,

209
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,550
I 'm staying at the
Inn at Chester Springs,

210
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,274
you can meet me there
when you're ready to sign.

211
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,589
It was very nice to
meet You all. Good day!

212
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:53,911
Sarah has inherited a house in Norway.

213
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,110
I'm thinking it is
connected to my family.

214
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,630
Yeah, but why was it left to me?

215
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,275
I don't know. Mom and dad they never
told me much about my real parents.

216
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:08,590
We can sell the house for
$300,000 mom, isn't that great?

217
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,030
Yeah, that's great.
$300,000 is that true?

218
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,474
Yes

219
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,159
We could really use that money.

220
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,273
Yeah but, this could

be my childhood home.

221
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,675
Shouldn't we go look
at it before we sell it?

222
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,234
We can't even afford a
vacation on the Jersey Shore,

223
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,078
how are we going to
afford a trip to Norway?

224
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,918
This is my roots, Jen,

225
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:33,108
"If we sell it, then you can go on a
"root expedition'"'" next year to Norway,"

226
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,712
You're probably right,
but it's Sarah's house,

227
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:45,675
All I'm saying is we should let
her be part of the final decision,

228
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,394
Well, at least we could
afford my riding if we sell it.

229
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,880
Hi Sarah.

230
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,359
Hi.

231
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,760
Mom and dad just left
to sign the contract,

232
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,671
So many strange things are happening,

233
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,272
I dream all these weird
dreams, Then the house.

234
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,392
Are you still afraid of the horses?

235
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:45,840
Well, mom won't pay for the horse
anymore, I guess it doesn't matter,

236
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,116
Don't worry, I have your
horse lessons fixed for you,

237
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,628
Here you go. Now you can ride again.

238
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,671
Eric! Where did you
get all this money?

239
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,835
It's a secret.

240
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,712
I believed you when you said
you didn't steal from Barry!

241
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,029
I didn't steal this money!

242
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,152
Eric, what am I supposed to believe?

243
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:13,078
I didn't steal it, I just wanted to
help! I thought you would be happy.

244
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,959
Alright I'm sorry OK, but Eric!

245
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,269
Eric!

246
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,869
I'm too old for this!

247
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:38,190
Sarah Good, I have something for you.

248
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,510
I can't take anything from strangers.

249
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,510
Th is is not from a stranger. This
is from your great-grandmother.

250
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,917
So this is your final offer?

251
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,709
Like I said before, my
client's offer is very generous.

252
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,509
There is no room for negotiation.

253
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,119
Is this from Norway?

254
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,753
Yes it is,

255
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,191
It's so beautiful. Eric, look at this.

256
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:40,676
So, who are you and how
did you get this box?

257
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,400
My name is Tor Stormberg,

258
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,349
I used to work for your great
grandmother, Gudrun Schillingmeyer,

259
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:52,036
She's the one that passed
away last Friday, right?

260
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,475
How did you know?

261
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,199
A lawyer came to our house today.

262
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,392
He told us we had to sell
my dad's childhood home,

263
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,511
It was left to me in a will,

264
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,638
Lars is fast.

265
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,159
Do you know the buyer?

266
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,997
Yes, I know him,

267
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:24,074
This is from my dream! Who is she?

268
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,596
Svanhild. She was
your father's mother.

269
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:31,913
My grandmother... is she still alive?

270
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,076
No, She died when
your dad was a baby.

271
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:42,998
Look at the beautiful horse,
Her name was Monocerus.

272
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,678
Actually, my horse is descendent from
Monocerus. His name is Betelgeuze,

273
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:55,552
I wish I could get over my
fear and ride a horse like that.

274
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,716
I've known people
afraid of horses before,

275
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,110
Look what I found in this book.

276
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:12,750
I think Gudrun wanted
you to go to Norway.

277
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,037
So, what do you think?

278
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:34,119
I think it's a fair price for an
old house. I think we should sign.

279
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,310
Ok,

280
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,353
Hello, welcome to the

Inn at Chester Springs.

281
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,676
We need to find Mr.
Vogelman, the lawyer!

282
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,598
Just one moment,

283
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,834
Mr. Vogelman is in
conference room 3 1 4,

284
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,514
3 1 4? Come on Sarah!

285
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,274
It's on the third
floor! Use the stairs,

286
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,834
Don't sign the contract!

287
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,633
Here is your ticket Miss Good.

288
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,120
Thank you,

289
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,395
And why are you
traveling to Norway today?

290
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,357
To ride again.

291
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,680
And to solve a mystery,

292
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,194
And to solve a mystery,
isn't that interesting?

293
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,318
Wel l, I hope you solve
it, You enjoy your flight,

294
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,597
Than k you,

295
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,669
You know what I'm happy about?

296
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,348
What?

297
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,517
The fact that your family is
paying for a vacation for once,

298
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,873
I wonder what it's going to
be like to see that house.

299
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,797
You mean, before we sell it?

300
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,399
Yeah.

301
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,753
I hope you remembered
your tooth brushes!

302
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,509
Because in Norway they brush
their teeth with walrus whiskers!

303
00:25:57,160 --> 00:26:02,757
And everyone there eats raw meat,

304
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,520
And then it's freezing cold all year
long and everyone gets around on skis,

305
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:13,275
And you may be eaten by polar bears
because they roam the streets there.

306
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,038
Sebastian!

307
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,792
Unless you get killed by the Vikings

308
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,230
that escaped from the
Viking reservations first,

309
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,034
Oh hhh.

310
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,189
I win!

311
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,199
He's beaten me again!

312
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:32,277
This is going to be a long flight...
Let's go take a walk, come on honey,

313
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,669
You guys watch the bags?

314
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,273
Sure,

315
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:53,470
The unicorn is a noble
creature. He keeps himself safe,

316
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:57,917
Upon a narrow path, high and
steep. Climbing to the sky,

317
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,629
I wonder if Gudrun wrote this?

318
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,753
Maybe...

319
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,314
Why don't you get out
your video games out?

320
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,550
I don't have my video games anymore,

321
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,750
What happened to them?

322
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,712
I sold them.

323
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,558
Why?

324
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:22,512
So that you could get
money to ride again.

325
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,237
This does not look Good Lars.

326
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:47,994
What?

327
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,314
We don't have enough money
to keep up with the loan...

328
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,472
What are you rattling on about Edith?

329
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:59,955
Look at the statement, You can not buy
Fjordheim, we don't have enough money.

330
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:05,076
Edith, do you know
what this is? Do you?

331
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:08,550
That is your stupid
dream of a found treasure,

332
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,753
No. It's not numbers on a
spreadsheet or on a computer screen.

333
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,749
It is real, it is tangible and it is
out there and I'm going to find it.

334
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:23,392
That little green piece of olivine
is not real, it is your dream,

335
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,558
What we need is cold hard cash.

336
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,797
Hard cash is not a problem!

337
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,039
Should we really be doing this
dad? What if we get caught?

338
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:46,592
So what? This place is going
to be mine anyway soon enough.

339
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:51,120
This is the last chance to search
Fjordheim before the Americans arrive,

340
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,951
Let's just go home.

341
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,192
Would you quit being such a cry baby
and help me out for once! Please!

342
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,952
You're in this too now you know.

343
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:04,029
What are you looking for anyway? I
thought it was the mine you wanted?

344
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,315
I've been here a dozen
times and nothing.

345
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,870
Nobody knows where that
woman found the olivine.

346
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,959
There's got to be a clue in this
house somewhere. There's got to be.

347
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,309
Look at that, snow in July!

348
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:44,480
Upon a narrow path, high and
steep, climbing to the sky,,.

349
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,391
What did you say?

350
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,791
I just remembered something.

351
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,871
Hey, look!

352
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,633
Look at it!

353
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,594
Look at that!

354
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,392
It's beautiful,

355
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:47,198
Hi Tor! This is Tor
who gave me the box.

356
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,432
This is the key to Fjordheim.
May it give you comfort.

357
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,068
Thanks. Is that Betelgeuze?

358
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,309
Yes it is,

359
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,879
Do you think I can ride on him?

360
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,629
Wow, wow! Steady boy.

361
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,836
One step at a time, Sarah,

362
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:13,436
Tor, look what I found

in the lid of the box!

363
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,480
I don't want to see that! I can't...

364
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,029
You should go, I shouldn't
have brought you here,

365
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,198
Tor? I don't get it?

366
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,958
Nice to see you,

367
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,034
We're here,

368
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:19,190
What a house! This is incredible,

369
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,759
Let's have a look.

370
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,155
The key doesn't work,

371
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,392
That's odd,

372
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,080
Come on, Sarah, let's
find a way in to the house,

373
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:51,677
I've been here before, I can sense it.

374
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:58,075
That's nice honey.
I'm sorry, I'm tired.

375
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,720
Oh no! Sarah, are you alright?

376
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,360
We can get in now,

377
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,316
You broke yourself in?

378
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,198
It's my house, isn't it?

379
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,189
Come on.

380
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,998
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

381
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,757
Hey, look at this,
Something is broken.

382
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,668
What is it?

383
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,080
It looks like some kind of a lamp.

384
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,991
Hey, let's look upstairs!

385
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,037
Jen... Look...

386
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,959
Svanhild, my mother,

387
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,632
That must be you!

388
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,112
Must be.

389
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,518
She sang lullaby's
to me in this house,

390
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,519
I didn't even know her,

391
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:54,511
Maybe now is your chance.

392
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,431
I want to sleep here!

393
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,551
Can I sleep here too?

394
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,111
Oh, not bad,

395
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:17,316
Wow, where are you guys staying?

396
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,197
Sarah?

397
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,279
Sarah? Are you O K?

398
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:07,990
Yeah, I just had this really
strange dream, It was nothing.

399
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,637
Look how clear the sky is Sarah,

400
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,948
The moon looks so big.

401
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:29,194
You know what we need? An
observatory with a telescope on it.

402
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,269
There is an old silo near the house,

we could put it on top of that.

403
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,438
What do you think?

404
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,638
I think it's great, dad.

405
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,391
There's fire in the kitchen guys!

406
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,511
That's nice honey.

407
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,868
I need coffee.

408
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,916
Have you seen Eric?

409
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,799
No I have not seen him
yet. Could you look for him?

410
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,434
Sure,

411
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,992
I need coffee.

412
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,076
Eric?

413
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,758
Mom wants you!

414
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,196
Eric?

415
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,718
Eric?

416
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,996
Mom, dad, Sarah! I caught breakfast!

417
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,110
I didn't realize how easy it
was to catch fish from the lake.

418
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,076
It's a Fjord, It's not a lake.
It's saltwater, from the glaciers.

419
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,832
Can you say it? Fjord!

420
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,040
Fjord,

421
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,792
That's it, you got it.

422
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,519
Eric, this is Good.

423
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,399
My fish is always the best fish,

424
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:52,120
We don't even need electricity
to get it cozy in here,

425
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,348
You don't think so?

426
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,039
Then maybe you can do
the cooking from now on.

427
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:03,080
What's the matter Sarah? You
don't like fish for breakfast?

428
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,150
No, I'm just really tired.

429
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,356
Whoooow!

430
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,474
Cool! Do you think it still I works?

431
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,358
Come on! If an old woman in her
80's could make it work, so can we,

432
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,394
Look at this crank.
Let's see if it works!

433
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,598
In to the driver's seat, Sir.

434
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,960
Are you sure? Mom
probably won't like this.

435
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,871
She's going to love it. You'll see,

436
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,312
Alright, put your left foot
on the clutch right here.

437
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,400
And put your right foot
on the gas, lightly.

438
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,790
Turn on the ignition right
there. I'll crank her up.

439
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,469
Are you ready?

440
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,430
Yeah.

441
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,189
I'll try it again.

442
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,873
Whoa! It works!

443
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,193
Move over.

444
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,989
Hang on.

445
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,750
Idiot! Where did you learn to drive?

446
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:22,516
Oh, Mr. Good! I'm so sorry,
I didn't realize it was you.

447
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,676
Lars Storhaug, it's nice to meet you,

448
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,549
Sebastian Good. I guess
we already met your lawyer?

449
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:36,268
Oh yes, exactly! I see you have
Gudrun's old truck running, Not bad!

450
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,835
But you must have had a tough
time getting in to the house?

451
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:41,473
We did actually,

452
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,149
Well, I had a security lock put on,

453
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,276
I can let you in right
now if you'd like,

454
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:51,757
You wouldn't believe the people who
would break in to a house like this,

455
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,830
Oh, Mrs. Good, I presume?

456
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,473
Jennifer Good, my pleasure,

457
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,478
Lars Storhaug, the
pleasure is all mine.

458
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:04,709
And, what does an American housewife

think of a typical Norwegian kitchen?

459
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,798
I think it's a little
old-fashioned, but it's nice enough.

460
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:11,708
Well, don't you miss your television
and your microwave and your toasters?

461
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,957
No, I miss electricity though.

462
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,309
You don't have electricity?

463
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,032
No.

464
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,516
I think I might be able
to solve your problem.

465
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:34,435
Gudrun was obsessed about hiding things,
but that would have been ridiculous,

466
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,993
I caught some fish this morning!

467
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:39,510
Oh, a typical American sportsman.
Loves to catch his own food, N ice!

468
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:42,108
Let me show you some other
things about the house,

469
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,989
I don't know how much you
folks know about old houses,

470
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:47,269
Oh, a fair amount.

471
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,756
Sebastian.,, No we
don't know that much,

472
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,558
Do you see that spot over there?

473
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:53,994
Yeah.

474
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:55,269
I can't see any spot,

475
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,276
Eric!

476
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,079
That's fungus. Not easy to
spot with an untrained eye.

477
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,076
But that one little speck of mold
can grow and grow and multiply.

478
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:13,318
...from the basement all
the way on up to the chimney!

479
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:21,233
Eventually enveloping the entire house
in a giant, dark, sliming mushroom.

480
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,634
And you know how to get rid of that?

481
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,637
There is only one way
to get rid of that.

482
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,512
No

483
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,876
You burn the house down,

484
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,519
Hi.

485
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,037
This is oven polish.
Is that what you wanted?

486
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:02,276
Oh, I thought it was some
Norwegian spread for bread.

487
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:07,235
No, it's not easy to know
everything in a new country,

488
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,914
You belong to the family that's
staying up at Gudrun's old house?

489
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:12,600
Yeah, I'm Sarah, Sarah Good,

490
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:16,309
How long are you and your family
planning on staying in Norway?

491
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,351
I'm not really sure.

492
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:23,193
Well it's Good to see some
new faces around lnnvik.

493
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,634
Christian!

494
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,353
Yeah.

495
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:29,512
Grab me two ice cream cones,

496
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:31,792
Have you tasted
Norwegian ice cream yet?

497
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,360
No, not yet,

498
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:36,079
It's very, very Good, Here,

499
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:39,670
Why don't you show
Sarah around lnnvik?

500
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,989
Ok, but dad told me to restock...

501
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,280
Don't worry about it,

502
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:45,040
If he asks you about it, just tell
him I gave you the afternoon off.

503
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:46,871
You don't have to do this for me,

504
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:47,750
Don't worry about it,

505
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,553
I'll just finish ringing this up and
I'll have it sent up to your house,

506
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,432
Thank you,

507
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,195
Thanks mom,

508
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:12,757
Let's go over there,

509
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,309
So...

510
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,754
You first,

511
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:18,559
How did you get that scrape?

512
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:21,314
OH, Tor's horse almost ran me over,

513
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,557
That horse is wild and Tor doesn't
look after it, Do you know Tor?

514
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,838
Not really, He gave me this
box from Gudrun after she died,

515
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,558
He brought it al l
the way to the states,

516
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,075
Tor was in the U,S,?

517
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,310
So, you know Tor?

518
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:38,074
Nobody really knows Tor,
everybody knows of him.

519
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:41,391
He used to be the superintendent
of the mine before it got shut down.

520
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,589
What mine?

521
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,640
Don't you know about the mine? I
thought it belonged to Fjordheim?

522
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,320
I don't know anything about
it, What kind of mine is it?

523
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,074
I think it used to be an old iron
mine or something, It's pretty cool.

524
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,192
I used to play there when I was
little, but Tor kept chasing me off,

525
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,069
He said a girl died there and
I'd be next if I didn't stop.

526
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,593
Oh.

527
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:05,355
People blamed Tor for her death,
because he didn't keep it secure,

528
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:07,835
So now it's locked up all the time.

529
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,590
Sarah! Can you get me something
to put this broken glass in?

530
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,833
Here you go.

531
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:30,480
Look at this mess. Here.

532
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,436
Wait, don't throw that away,

533
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:33,595
Why not?

534
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,159
Because I want to try
to glue it back together.

535
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:36,480
No, we're throwing it away honey.

536
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:41,600
No mom, please, It's really
pretty. Please come on.

537
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:45,514
OK, but don't cut yourself. I don't
know where the hospital is yet. Ok?

538
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,308
Dad, is that a cow coming?

539
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,557
I think so,

540
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:58,111
Do you think she's dangerous? Go away!

541
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,029
Shooe!

542
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:01,919
Go away!

543
00:49:08,840 --> 00:49:10,353
Go back to that barn!

544
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,119
Go away! We don't want you here!

545
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:17,790
Go away!

546
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:21,874
Yes! Not here! Just go back!

547
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:24,316
Don't mind them.
They're a little crazy,

548
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,080
Mrs, Good, a little
something for the house.

549
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:33,160
Thank you, that's a very nice plant,

550
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,798
Oh, you're so welcome.

551
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,550
That's excellent coffee Mrs. Good.

552
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:42,233
It's instant,

553
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,360
Oh, well, it must be the atmosphere
in this wonderful kitchen.

554
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:49,830
Really? I think it's a
little bit gloomy in here.

555
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:57,274
So Lars tell me, why do
you want this big old house?

556
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,789
Oh, it's purely sentimental,

557
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:06,320
I love old houses and I own half the
rest of the town anyway so I figured

558
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:11,314
Excuse me but it is a big
house, and it's on a lot of land.

559
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,319
Don't you think it's
worth more than $300,000?

560
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,998
From the outside it
might look that way.

561
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,277
But I looked at the foundation,
it's completely shot,

562
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,512
It will cost you $300,,000
just to fix that alone.

563
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,033
Really?

564
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,954
What about the mine? Now,
that must be worth something?

565
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,156
What mine?

566
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,869
It's an old mine, it hasn't
been used in forty years,

567
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,151
It's abandoned, it's
completely worthless.

568
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:42,600
Where did you get that?

569
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,953
I found it.

570
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:48,709
What is that?

571
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:55,115
Get out of here! Yeehaw, come on!

572
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,990
Hi Sarah! Hold up a second!

573
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,269
We're going the same way,
let me give you a lift!

574
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:41,350
No!

575
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:43,550
What's the matter, my car
is not good enough for you?

576
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,636
Or I'm not good enough
for little miss America?

577
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:48,475
Upon a narrow path,
steep climbing to the sky,

578
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:05,109
So, Betelgeuze brought you?
You're not so frightened anymore?

579
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:08,475
I'm not so sure,

580
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:13,429
Why did you get so
mad when you saw this?

581
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:20,556
Why did Gudrun have
to give this to you?

582
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:25,829
I don't know, but,
can you help me ride?

583
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,958
Alright, just give me a minute,

584
00:54:37,880 --> 00:54:40,394
Don't be frightened, Betelgeuze.

585
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:46,998
Don't be frightened,
I want to ride you.

586
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,069
I'm a friend, You understand?

587
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,800
Calm down.

588
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:18,592
Yeah... You understand.

589
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:23,554
He trusts me.

590
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:29,429
The saddle is just
to prepare Betelgeuze,

591
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:32,034
I don't want you to
mount the saddle yet.

592
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,309
But he trusts me!

593
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:35,431
We're going to take this slowly,

594
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,390
I want to try!

595
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:37,589
No Sarah, no!

596
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:44,198
How boy,.. Easy boy.,,

597
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,514
I told you, one step at a time,

598
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:52,000
You'll never learn to
ride again this way!

599
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:56,516
Why don't you listen? You're
too much like Svanhild!

600
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,676
Come on Betelgeuze,

601
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,358
Good job, you got it.

602
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,960
Hi dad, Eric. Look what
I found in the house!

603
00:56:57,080 --> 00:57:00,038
Wow! Bring it up Sarah,

604
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:05,600
Where d id you find that?

605
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:06,874
Upstairs, under the bed,

606
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,080
Old brass telescope.

607
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,593
How far can we see
with that thing, dad?

608
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:13,511
Maybe the rings around Mars,

609
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,153
Hey, it works!

610
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:23,999
Hey guys, Wow it's
looking great. Oh my gosh.

611
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,520
Hi, look what Sarah found.

612
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,953
Wow, can somebody help me out here,

613
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:28,080
It works!

614
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:31,959
Does it really! Cool. That
will fit you r observatory, hah.

615
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,118
What is this supposed to be?

616
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,110
Hi Lars.

617
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,520
It's an observatory,

618
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:44,116
An observatory? What are
you going to use it for?

619
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,115
Keep his home-planet
under surveillance,

620
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:50,989
I n the fall the stars
are going to be beautiful.

621
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,832
Wait a minute, the fall?

622
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,713
You're planning to
stay here to the fall?

623
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,035
Maybe. Is that a problem?

624
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,236
No, not necessarily,

625
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,557
But you did get permission
to build this, didn't you?

626
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:05,120
Permission?

627
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,918
Oh yes, Fjordheim and the
estate are historic landmarks.

628
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:11,749
You can't just build an
observatory here if you want to,

629
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:14,758
You got to start take
things down right now,

630
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:19,240
But a good stiff breeze in the fall
will bring this pile of junk right.

631
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:22,198
Lars, what is it that you want?

632
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:25,350
What I want is this house,

633
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:27,914
And you better accept the money
and the offer that I made you.

634
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,788
Because I have ways
of getting what I want,

635
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,876
Without you getting a single thing,

636
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,877
Steady boy.

637
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:35,955
Good afternoon, Tor,

638
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:37,834
Good afternoon.

639
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,190
I'd like to talk to you, Tor.

640
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:43,833
About what?

641
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:48,596
About Lars, He wants
to buy Fjordheim,

642
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,749
Fjordheim?

643
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:54,158
And the mine, He thin ks
it is full of gemstones.

644
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:57,272
That's what he thinks, huh?

645
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,440
He won't listen to me Tor.
Maybe you could talk to him?

646
01:01:01,440 --> 01:01:03,192
What does this have to do with me?

647
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:06,989
You worked in the mine, You know
that there is nothing in there.

648
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:13,152
Tor Stormberg? Well, You are a
rare sight to see around these parts

649
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,032
I guess it depends on where you look,

650
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,240
Edith, have you rung him up yet?

651
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,070
Yes,

652
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,959
Just cancel that bill.
Today it's on the house,

653
01:01:20,080 --> 01:01:22,720
I can pay for myself,

654
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:25,075
Well, I just want to make
it up to you, that's all,

655
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,349
Make up for what?

656
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,800
Well, the way I've
treated you in the past,

657
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,759
And nobody knows more about
Fjordheim and the mine than you do,

658
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,080
And...?

659
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:36,878
Well, you might have some
valuable piece of information,

660
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,436
Information that I'd be willing
to pay a lot of money for.

661
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:55,993
I found a broken lamp just
like that at Fjordheim.

662
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,233
Gudrun gave that to me
right before she died.

663
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:05,551
You're just like Svanhild.

664
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,028
What happened to her?

665
01:03:11,480 --> 01:03:13,040
I killed her.

666
01:03:13,040 --> 01:03:15,040
No, not that way.

667
01:03:15,040 --> 01:03:19,760
She died in the mine,

but it was my fault.

668
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:25,835
She was obsessed with finding
olivine and I couldn't keep her away.

669
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,758
Olivine? What's that?

670
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,358
That is olivine.

671
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,999
It's a valuable green crystal
that Gudrun found in the mine,

672
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,000
She never told anyone
where she found it.

673
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,070
She wouldn't even
tell her own daughter,

674
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,514
Did this belong to Svanhild?

675
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:50,791
Yes, Gudrun made it for her.

676
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,993
Is it the mine that leads
up here to Stormberg?

677
01:03:55,120 --> 01:03:59,477
That mine is a grave.
You're never to go there,

678
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:14,628
I have to ride again,
Will you help me?

679
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:21,751
OK,

680
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:34,873
Sarah, come here,

681
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,839
You really want this?

682
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,918
I'm not scared,

683
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:47,752
You're sure? You won't
rush it like before, right?

684
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:53,832
No, I remember what you
told me in the States, Tor,

685
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:59,916
I'm not afraid of the
horse, I'm afraid of myself,

686
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,996
And you're not afraid
of yourself anymore?

687
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:08,272
No, not afraid.

688
01:05:27,080 --> 01:05:30,709
Alright, let's give it a try.

689
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,752
Lars, where are you going?

690
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:40,634
If nobody wants to help me find
the olivine, I'll find it myself!

691
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:43,430
Lars!

692
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:40,911
That's where she's buried.

693
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:49,312
You followed me!

694
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:57,314
I asked you not to come here,
You disturb the peace of the dead.

695
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:02,394
Is this the rockslide
that killed Svanhild?

696
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:05,192
Yes,

697
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:13,110
Is this where Gudrun
found the olivine for this?

698
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:16,437
Listen Sarah, don't you
start searching for it too.

699
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,358
Stay away from this mine from now on,

700
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:21,955
But it must be worth a fortune!

701
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,275
Gudrun wasn't obsessed with money,

702
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:27,790
She only took a small portion
of the olivine for her artwork,

703
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:31,879
She was obsessed with
the beauty of the stone.

704
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:34,873
That same obsession is
what killed Svanhild.

705
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,074
What was that?

706
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:45,793
There are many small rock slides.
I told you this is not a safe place.

707
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,515
Come, I have something to show you.

708
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:40,120
This was made by a
renowned Russian Artist.

709
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:41,394
Was Gudrun rich?

710
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:46,200
Oh yes, she was rich with
friends, from all over Europe,

711
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:47,792
Did they all come here to Fjordheim?

712
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,596
Yes, she opened up Fjordheim for
the artists during the summer,

713
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:56,395
But the people in town didn't like
all those strange people around,

714
01:09:56,520 --> 01:10:01,355
They thought Gudrun could do more to
make the mine a profitable industry,

715
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:05,792
Gudrun was stubborn, She
didn't care what they thought.

716
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:10,752
Svanhild's bunad.

717
01:10:11,960 --> 01:10:13,075
Bunad?

718
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:21,636
It's a national costume. Made
to wear for special occasions,

719
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:27,357
The last time Svanhild wore this
was when Gudrun gave her the unicorn,

720
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:34,875
That was the last time
she was truly happy,

721
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,632
What was Svanhild like?

722
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:44,395
Lonely. So I gave her the foal,

723
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:48,308
I hoped it would
bring her more friends.

724
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:59,349
Legend has it that Gudrun found a
large vein of crystal in the mine,

725
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:03,593
Svanhild was obsessed
with finding more,

726
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:07,631
The mine became a dangerous
playground for her.

727
01:11:12,440 --> 01:11:17,195
When your father was born, l
closed off the mine. Padlocked it,

728
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:22,919
One night I forgot to lock it,
and that was when it happened.

729
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:35,397
There, you see, That's
what Svanhild was missing.

730
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,113
A family.

731
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,836
This is the last load Eric,
with it we finish the job,

732
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:54,993
Let's go pick up mom and Sarah

733
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:59,229
OK, Hey Eric, how many days
before we finish the job?

734
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:01,600
I bet one!

735
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:05,878
One day? OK, then that is the goal!

736
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,673
Oh, no.

737
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:29,233
Why would somebody do this?

738
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:30,674
Could it have been the cow?

739
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,592
A cow didn't do this.

740
01:12:32,720 --> 01:12:33,914
Oh, jeez,

741
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,070
Christian? What are you doing?

742
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,189
It was my dad that did it.

743
01:12:38,360 --> 01:12:39,960
And you didn't stop him?

744
01:12:39,960 --> 01:12:42,840
I tried to, but I could

only save the telescope.

745
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:44,480
Well, you can just stay away!

746
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,160
I don't want to see you or
your family here anymore!

747
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,958
Sarah, calm down. He's
just trying to help,

748
01:12:57,120 --> 01:13:01,716
Don't worry about it Christian.
Maybe you should go home though.

749
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,274
I'm really sorry.

750
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,589
I know.

751
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:19,919
Forget it. It's hopeless.

752
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:30,793
Tor! Tor! Tor!

753
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,075
Lars destroyed dad's observatory!

754
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,478
Sorry, I can't help you
when it comes to Lars,

755
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:41,354
Please, Tor!

756
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:45,111
This isn't anything I can help with.

757
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:51,272
Is it true then, what they say about
you? That you are a grumpy old hermit?

758
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:55,998
If the people want me to be
a hermit, let them have it.

759
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:06,109
Listen, Do You remember
how eager I was to sell?

760
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,075
Well, not anymore.
We're going to stay.

761
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:16,320
And you are going to rebuild
this platform, piece by piece.

762
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:20,230
And I'm going to help you. Ok?

763
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,391
I'll help you too, dad,

764
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:56,397
Lars! Why did you
destroy the observatory?

765
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,230
Because you people have interfered
with me for the last time.

766
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:03,468
What?

767
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:05,353
I've seen you talking to Tor,

768
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:07,510
He must have told you were
the olivine is? Didn't he?

769
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:09,674
I don't know anything about that!

770
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:11,080
You better tell me where it's hidden!

771
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,760
Or else the observatory isn't the only
thing that's going to be destroyed.

772
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:15,671
Do you understand? Do you?

773
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:17,353
Just take it!

774
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:21,513
Wait! Wait!

775
01:15:25,720 --> 01:15:27,676
Sarah, stop,

776
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:28,830
No.

777
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:35,038
Where's that olivine? Tell
me what I want to know!

778
01:15:36,960 --> 01:15:40,953
Stop! Sarah, come back here!

779
01:17:23,880 --> 01:17:27,236
I'm sorry to ask Tor,
but do you recognize this?

780
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:32,592
Svan hild.

781
01:17:33,880 --> 01:17:35,950
What do you know about this, Tor?

782
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,190
How would I know about this?

783
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,559
The last I saw of her was when she
flew out of Fjordheim on Monocerus.

784
01:17:44,680 --> 01:17:47,990
Later I found the horse
in front of the mine.

785
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:51,675
I thought she was
taken by the rock slide.

786
01:17:52,520 --> 01:17:54,750
I wonder why she wasn't found before?

787
01:17:54,880 --> 01:17:56,560
Well, we all thought
she died in the mine.

788
01:17:56,560 --> 01:17:58,391
We never conducted a thorough search.

789
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:03,917
See, Tor, it wasn't your fault,

790
01:18:08,320 --> 01:18:10,675
Come Sarah, I'll follow you home,

791
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:13,109
I can take her home.

792
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:17,958
I think I'm ready to
face Svanhild's son now,

793
01:18:18,120 --> 01:18:19,678
Come, Sarah,

794
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:31,035
... well that makes sense,

795
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,792
What I don't understand
though is, why was I adopted?

796
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,914
Why couldn't I stay here with Gudrun?

797
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,192
Gudrun wasn't able to take
care of you after Svanhild died,

798
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,272
But how did he end up in America?

799
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:47,639
A friend of Gudrun knew
his American parents.

800
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,629
That summer they came to Fjordheim,
they fell in love with him,

801
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,232
Gudrun wanted you to have
a strong, supportive family.

802
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:00,874
That's why she never
contacted you again.

803
01:19:01,080 --> 01:19:05,358
She felt it was better that you
started a new life there, in America,

804
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,600
She wanted me to have a normal family.

805
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:18,518
Thank you Tor, for caring
so much for my mother,,..

806
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:22,115
and thank you for
looking after Sarah,

807
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:30,150
I feel like I've wasted
35 years of my life.

808
01:19:30,280 --> 01:19:33,909
And there's still quite
a few things to sort out.

809
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:37,353
I need to have a talk with Lars,

810
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,711
I'll help you with that
observatory one of these days,

811
01:19:41,120 --> 01:19:46,080
Oh, Tor. If you see Christian,
could you tell him I'm sorry?

812
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:47,433
Sure will.

813
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:24,119
Lars isn't here.

814
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:25,549
Where is he?

815
01:20:30,080 --> 01:20:31,433
The mine,

816
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:35,833
Tor, I'm so afraid that something
terrible is going to happen to him,

817
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,512
Edith, I won't let him destroy
anything for you or Christian.

818
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,240
I'll go talk to Lars,

819
01:20:43,240 --> 01:20:44,753
Well, here!

820
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:21,069
Hoow, hoow Boy. Easy,

821
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:37,838
Lars? Lars!

822
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:48,196
I'm not afraid of you, Lars Storhaug,
and I know what you are looking for.

823
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,600
You know, mines can be very
hazardous places for people,

824
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:54,273
Especially for stupid
old fools, like you!

825
01:21:54,400 --> 01:21:58,632
The olivine won't help you and it's
sad what you're doing to your family,

826
01:21:58,840 --> 01:22:02,400
What I'm doing to my family?
I'm doing this for my family!

827
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:06,916
I don't want them to be bankrupt
and have to be ashamed of me.

828
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:11,000
You brought yourself up from nothing
once Lars, You can do it again!

829
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:16,800
The olivine is just and obsession,
It's dangerous, It will consume you,

830
01:22:16,800 --> 01:22:20,395
I know. Because the same
thing happened to Svanhild.

831
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:26,351
All I hear is Svanhild! I am sick
to death of hearing that name.

832
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:32,709
Now, You're going to tell me where
Gudrun hid the olivine. And now!

833
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:18,478
Betelgeuze! Is that You?

834
01:23:52,240 --> 01:23:55,596
Tor! Tor!

835
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,117
Tor, are you OK?

836
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:06,589
We are trapped in here,
Sarah! Ride for help! Hurry!

837
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,629
Are you sure?

838
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:10,639
Yes, Go.

839
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:28,272
Easy Betelgeuze. We
have to help Tor, OK?

840
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,751
Easy


841
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:50,195
Ok, let's go.

842
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:30,549
Betelgeuze...

843
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:42,753
Please...

844
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:10,238
I'm going to go get help, OK?
Just hold on, I'll be right back.

845
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,200
Hold on OK? I'll be back real soon.

846
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,917
Help me, please.

847
01:26:52,480 --> 01:26:53,799
Take him away guys.

848
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,198
What's your involvement in this Tor?

849
01:27:08,520 --> 01:27:09,953
Do you think I hurt Lars?

850
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,629
Just asking.

851
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:19,191
It was a rock slide,
Tor saved my life,

852
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:24,875
Dad!

853
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,360
I'm alright son.

854
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,509
What happened?

855
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:32,279
I was a fool. I'll be all right,

856
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,432
Ok, let's go.

857
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,956
That was one big
rock slide, wasn't it?

858
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:45,553
Buried everything.

859
01:27:47,880 --> 01:27:49,598
Well, I won't be digging
there anymore, will l?

860
01:27:50,040 --> 01:27:51,632
Dig for what?

861
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:54,360
Come on, you know
what I'm talking about,

862
01:27:54,480 --> 01:27:56,710
We'll forget the stuff
in the mine forever.

863
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:58,233
Ok,

864
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:14,556
Is he dead?

865
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:04,668
Alright, how is that?

866
01:31:05,040 --> 01:31:08,271
Not bad Tor, not bad.

867
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:11,320
Hi Sarah.

868
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,470
Hi, is it finished?

869
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:19,199
Oh, just about. We were thinking you
could have the honor trying it first.

870
01:31:22,120 --> 01:31:23,792
There's a star here
you've got to see, Sarah,

871
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:34,158
Wow. It's like a
jewel. What's its name?

872
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:42,358
Betelgeuze, in the
constellation of Orion.

873
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:49,035
Orion, the hunter, Killed
accidentally by the Goddess Artemisia.

874
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:54,875
I killed Betelgeuze,

875
01:31:55,040 --> 01:32:01,479
Sarah, I spent my life accusing
myself constantly, Don't do that,

876
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:04,632
You've got a long,
beautiful life to live,

877
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:14,592
Okay, I want Betelgeuze to look
down at me and to be proud of me.

878
01:32:15,640 --> 01:32:21,960
I know he is. Betelgeuze
was unique. One of a kind.

879
01:32:21,960 --> 01:32:27,520
He had a magical spirit that touched
everyone around him. Just like you,

880
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,158
Just like the unicorn.

881
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,517
There's a constellation for the
unicorn, too, Beta Monocerus.

882
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,115
So, where's that?

883
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:39,549
Here, I'll show you.

884
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:50,832
There it is, Here, have a look.

885
01:32:56,640 --> 01:33:00,030
You're looking at the
strongest star in the unicorn,

886
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:02,196
Beta Monocerus is a triple star.

887
01:33:03,160 --> 01:33:04,388
It's beautiful,

888
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,952
Like you, Sarah.

889
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:11,072
Wait... Did you say triple star?

890
01:33:11,280 --> 01:33:12,474
Yeah?

891
01:33:13,080 --> 01:33:17,358
I think maybe Gudrun is
trying to tell us something,

892
01:33:25,040 --> 01:33:31,149
Two close, one further away.
What is it supposed to mean?

893
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:36,833
The lamps!

894
01:33:38,760 --> 01:33:41,880
This lamp and your lamp are
like the stars in my necklace.

895
01:33:41,880 --> 01:33:44,110
If those two lamps are
the starting point...

896
01:33:44,240 --> 01:33:45,559
...the stars that are
closest together...

897
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,632
...then we just have
to find the third star!

898
01:33:49,600 --> 01:33:52,876
Here's Fjordheim and Stormberg...

899
01:33:54,160 --> 01:33:56,071
Could the third be the mine?

900
01:33:58,080 --> 01:34:00,548
No that's a little too close.

901
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:03,560
It should be here,
higher up on the mountain,

902
01:34:03,560 --> 01:34:03,958
It should be here,
higher up on the mountain,

903
01:34:23,720 --> 01:34:25,438
It should be around here someplace,

904
01:34:25,560 --> 01:34:26,515
I don't see anything...

905
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,316
Look! What's that?

906
01:34:58,400 --> 01:35:05,511
Wow! So this is where
Gudrun found it..,

907
01:35:45,680 --> 01:35:50,549
Sarah! Christian! I have
something to show you. Come!

908
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,633
You can see who the father is, right?

909
01:36:06,080 --> 01:36:07,513
Do you like him?

910
01:36:12,960 --> 01:36:14,279
I love him!

911
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:18,879
That's Good, because

he's yours, Sarah.

912
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:28,909
I'm going to name him Monocerus,
after Svanhild's horse.
