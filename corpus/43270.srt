1
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:08,621
Only a white man would make
a fire for everyone to see.

2
00:32:08,698 --> 00:32:11,360
Maybe there's more than one.

3
00:32:11,601 --> 00:32:14,502
There might be three or four.

4
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:18,802
I know three or four who will not be
making the trip back home.

5
00:32:18,875 --> 00:32:21,708
We have nothing to show
for this trail.

6
00:32:22,979 --> 00:32:24,970
We have no rifles.

7
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:28,108
White men
are sure to have rifles.

8
00:32:28,918 --> 00:32:32,251
It's hard to say how many
might be down there.

9
00:32:39,929 --> 00:32:42,454
We should forget this
and go home.

10
00:32:42,532 --> 00:32:44,625
Then go.

11
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,230
I would rather die...

12
00:32:47,303 --> 00:32:53,640
than argue about a single line
of smoke in my own country.

13
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,608
He will not quit
until we are all dead.

14
00:42:02,691 --> 00:42:05,216
I do not care for this talk
about a white man.

15
00:42:05,294 --> 00:42:09,196
Whatever he is, he is not Sioux
and that makes him less.

16
00:42:09,265 --> 00:42:11,358
When I hear that more whites
are coming, I want to laugh.

17
00:42:11,433 --> 00:42:12,263
We took a hundred horses
from these people.

18
00:42:12,334 --> 00:42:13,596
There was no honor in it.

19
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:17,332
They don't ride well.
They don't shoot well.

20
00:42:17,406 --> 00:42:19,340
They're dirty.

21
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:23,674
Those soldiers could not even
make it through one winter here.

22
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:28,439
And these people
are said to flourish?

23
00:42:29,518 --> 00:42:33,545
I think they will
all be dead soon.

24
00:42:36,058 --> 00:42:40,791
I think this fool
is probably lost.

25
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:48,564
Wind In His Hair's words are
strong and I have heard them.

26
00:42:48,637 --> 00:42:51,504
It's true the whites are
a poor race and hard to understand.

27
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:54,975
But make no mistake.
The whites are coming.

28
00:42:55,044 --> 00:42:57,035
Even our enemies agree on this.

29
00:42:57,112 --> 00:43:01,105
So when I see one man alone
without fear in our country...

30
00:43:01,216 --> 00:43:05,949
I do not think he is lost.
I think he may have medicine.

31
00:43:06,055 --> 00:43:09,547
I see someone who might speak...

32
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:11,990
for all the white people
who are coming.

33
00:43:12,795 --> 00:43:16,231
I think this is a person with
which treaties might be struck.

34
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:25,267
Kicking Bird is always
looking ahead and that is good.

35
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:30,703
But this man cannot cover
our lodges or feed our children.

36
00:43:30,779 --> 00:43:34,647
He is nothing to us.

37
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,411
I will take some men.

38
00:43:36,518 --> 00:43:38,645
We will shoot some arrows
into this white man.

39
00:43:38,754 --> 00:43:41,848
If he truly has medicine,
he will not be hurt.

40
00:43:41,957 --> 00:43:43,948
If he has no medicine,
he will be dead.

41
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:54,000
No man can tell another
what to do.

42
00:43:54,837 --> 00:43:57,271
But killing a white man
is a delicate matter.

43
00:43:57,339 --> 00:44:01,173
If you kill one,
more are sure to come.

44
00:44:06,615 --> 00:44:10,210
It's easy to become confused
by these questions.

45
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,317
It's hard to know what to do.

46
00:44:15,858 --> 00:44:19,487
We should talk about this
some more.

47
00:44:20,629 --> 00:44:22,620
That is all I have to say.

48
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,686
We'll be heroes.

49
00:45:23,692 --> 00:45:25,660
They'll write songs about us.

50
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:39,767
What happened?

51
00:45:45,314 --> 00:45:50,013
I don't know.
My arm doesn't work.

52
00:45:51,753 --> 00:45:55,849
You shouldn't have fallen off.
Now we'll get in trouble.

53
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:58,119
It was your idea.

54
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:04,496
My idea was only to take
the horse, not fall down.

55
00:46:08,604 --> 00:46:10,265
Otter hurt himself.

56
00:46:13,308 --> 00:46:15,606
What are you looking at?
I'm the one who's hurt.

57
00:46:15,677 --> 00:46:19,579
I will be when my father finds out.
His bow will be across my back.

58
00:48:44,259 --> 00:48:47,228
I am Wind In His Hair.

59
00:48:48,163 --> 00:48:50,757
I am Wind In His Hair.

60
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:54,864
Do you see
that I am not afraid of you?

61
00:48:54,936 --> 00:48:56,665
Do you see?

62
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,718
You are not welcome here.

63
00:56:35,663 --> 00:56:38,860
Go away from us.

64
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:49,941
You are not welcome.
Go away from us.

65
00:57:32,821 --> 00:57:34,721
Stop.

66
00:57:34,789 --> 00:57:37,986
The soldier did not come
to fight.

67
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:41,517
He is going away
and we will let him.

68
00:58:06,855 --> 00:58:10,484
I am in agreement
with Kicking Bird.

69
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:13,558
We will go down and talk
to the white man.

70
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:18,524
And find out why he is here.

71
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:29,199
If this council decides to talk
to the white man...

72
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:31,745
then it will be so.

73
00:58:32,513 --> 00:58:35,482
But in my mind
it's not right...

74
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:38,018
that a chief as great
as Ten Bears...

75
00:58:39,587 --> 00:58:40,952
goes to ask the business of
a puny, trespassing white man...

76
00:58:41,022 --> 00:58:43,923
who has only a smart horse
and a few white man's clothes.

77
00:58:46,127 --> 00:58:47,617
I will not go.

78
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,960
You will go.

79
00:58:55,904 --> 00:58:59,135
And you will go.

80
00:58:59,674 --> 00:59:02,438
That is all I have to say.

81
01:00:14,449 --> 01:00:16,508
His mind is gone.

82
01:03:02,783 --> 01:03:05,343
Stands With A Fist.

83
01:03:08,956 --> 01:03:11,481
We will talk awhile.

84
01:03:19,634 --> 01:03:22,364
Your wounds are healing well?

85
01:03:23,738 --> 01:03:26,332
Yes, they are.

86
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:32,836
You are happy here,
with my family?

87
01:03:32,914 --> 01:03:34,745
I am glad to be here.

88
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:39,752
I am missing my husband.

89
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:45,481
Perhaps you will marry again
when the time is right?

90
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,822
Perhaps.

91
01:03:51,966 --> 01:03:56,869
We have word from many places
that the whites are coming.

92
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:00,366
They are coming
into everyone's country.

93
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:02,636
I think they
will soon be in ours.

94
01:04:03,311 --> 01:04:05,973
This white man who lives
at the old soldier fort...

95
01:04:06,047 --> 01:04:08,948
I have visited him and I believe
his heart is a good one.

96
01:04:15,756 --> 01:04:18,054
I am afraid of the white man
at the fort.

97
01:04:19,193 --> 01:04:23,721
I am afraid he will tell others
that I am here.

98
01:04:23,831 --> 01:04:25,890
I am afraid they will
try to take me away.

99
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,968
I've heard they
take people away.

100
01:04:28,236 --> 01:04:30,534
Every warrior in camp
would fight them if they tried.

101
01:04:30,638 --> 01:04:33,129
I cannot make
the white man language.

102
01:04:33,241 --> 01:04:36,335
He cannot speak Sioux.

103
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:40,213
It has been a long time
since I made the talk.

104
01:04:40,281 --> 01:04:42,647
I want you to try.

105
01:04:43,317 --> 01:04:44,978
I don't know how.

106
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,383
Yes, you do.

107
01:04:46,454 --> 01:04:48,285
I can't.

108
01:04:49,223 --> 01:04:51,521
I can't. It's dead in me.

109
01:04:52,393 --> 01:04:56,659
I don't ask this for myself.
I ask this for all the people.

110
01:04:57,465 --> 01:05:00,457
He knows things about the whites
which we do not.

111
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:02,900
Now, you must remember.

112
01:05:06,073 --> 01:05:08,098
I can't.

113
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:22,248
Will she make the white words?

114
01:05:22,323 --> 01:05:26,089
She won't try.
She is being difficult.

115
01:05:26,627 --> 01:05:29,061
Well, she's the one
who's crying.

116
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:32,793
Perhaps the difficulty is yours.

117
01:12:07,795 --> 01:12:10,423
We were waiting for you.

118
01:12:21,575 --> 01:12:24,510
We were waiting for you.

119
01:12:24,578 --> 01:12:27,945
Now tell him we are glad
that he is here.

120
01:12:53,574 --> 01:12:57,840
Ask him why he is at
the soldier fort.

121
01:13:21,135 --> 01:13:24,901
He's right.
Introductions should come first.
