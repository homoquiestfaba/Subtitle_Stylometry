1
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:05,431
Abner!

2
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,899
Abner!

3
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:09,134
Leave that cat alone,
you silly dog!

4
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:22,981
Hi, Sophie!

5
00:01:30,223 --> 00:01:31,790
Hi, Chad.

6
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:35,727
So what's going on up there?

7
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,430
Oh, nothing.
Can I walk with you to school?

8
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,166
Sure. Isn't it
your birthday today?

9
00:01:41,168 --> 00:01:42,334
Yeah. You remembered?

10
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:44,803
Well, you told me yesterday.

11
00:01:44,805 --> 00:01:46,071
Oh.

12
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:48,373
Well, Happy Birthday.

13
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:50,175
You picked a great day for it.

14
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:54,113
The sky is so blue today.

15
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:56,181
Well, actually,
the sky isn't blue.

16
00:01:56,183 --> 00:01:58,917
It's the way the sunlight looks
in the earth's atmosphere.

17
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,152
Really?

18
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:02,387
Yeah, I mean, the sunlight
is different waves,

19
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,790
and each wave
is a different color,

20
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,192
and we see blue when
the white light is scattered

21
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,627
by air molecules.

22
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,696
Wow. You really know a lot.

23
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,665
Yeah, well,
we learned it in class.

24
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:16,635
Well, we're studying
dinosaurs right now.

25
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:21,473
Yeah. Dinosaurs are so cool.

26
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,050
Chad?

27
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:34,920
Is anything wrong?

28
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:37,890
No. Everything is fine. Yes.

29
00:02:37,892 --> 00:02:39,224
You're pretty smart,
aren't you?

30
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:42,995
Yeah, Chad's
a regular Einstein.

31
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:44,963
A real brainiac.

32
00:02:44,965 --> 00:02:47,166
He should be teaching science
instead of Mr. Schultz.

33
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,201
Right, Chad?

34
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:51,236
Hi, Kevin. Hi, Josh.

35
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,704
Hey.

36
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,506
You're dating
the brainiac, Sophie?

37
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,974
We're just talking.

38
00:02:55,976 --> 00:02:58,043
Lay off, Chad.
It's his birthday.

39
00:02:58,045 --> 00:02:59,912
Oh, you hear that, guys?

40
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:01,713
It's Chad's birthday.

41
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,448
You know what, Chad?

42
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,850
I am so sorry.

43
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:07,252
Let me guess.
You're 13, right?

44
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:08,253
That's right.

45
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:14,526
13's a really unlucky number.

46
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,895
You better be
real careful today.

47
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,934
Sorry about the books, Chad.

48
00:03:21,936 --> 00:03:25,070
Come on, Sophie.
We'll take you to school.

49
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:27,806
You don't want to be seen
with a dweeb like Chad.

50
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:29,942
People will start to talk.

51
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:42,788
One of these days...

52
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:09,982
Q-96 is stabilized, ma'am.

53
00:04:09,984 --> 00:04:13,585
Good. Put it with
the P-67 prototype.

54
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:18,624
<i>We've gotta take</i>
<i>good care of these.</i>

55
00:04:18,626 --> 00:04:21,326
You got that right, Jackie.

56
00:04:21,328 --> 00:04:23,762
Schedule the sterilization,
gentlemen.

57
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,964
That means lunch.

58
00:04:25,966 --> 00:04:28,333
<i>You got 35 minutes.</i>

59
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,039
Oh, my God. Look!

60
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:09,441
It's Old Man Jenkins!

61
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:11,310
He sure is movin' slow today.

62
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,145
I wonder why they
still keep him around.

63
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,047
He can barely lift
a waste paper basket.

64
00:05:15,049 --> 00:05:18,250
He may not have the muscle,
but he's got seniority.

65
00:05:18,252 --> 00:05:19,584
Don't you mean senility?

66
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:21,787
Don't be so callous, Ed.

67
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:24,256
We'll all be old someday.

68
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:25,957
Speak for yourself.

69
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:28,226
You're on break, Johnson.

70
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:30,228
You go in 30, Hayes.

71
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:45,777
Wow. Guess that old geezer moves
a little faster than we thought.

72
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,441
Hey, check this out.

73
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:18,543
Is that Jenkins?

74
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,379
Has he lost his mind?

75
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:23,181
Code red! Code red!
Go, guys, go.

76
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,362
- Where'd he go?
- Don't know!

77
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:39,831
- Hey!
- Hey! Stop!

78
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,740
Hey! Stop!

79
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,211
Hey, come on!

80
00:06:53,213 --> 00:06:54,212
Get back here!

81
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,015
He's in the east corridor.

82
00:06:57,017 --> 00:06:58,650
I'm coming with you.

83
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,439
Hey, hold it, buddy!

84
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,827
Ow!

85
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:44,930
Hey!

86
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,665
Come on, let's go!

87
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,066
Oh, right!

88
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,252
Where'd they go?

89
00:08:07,254 --> 00:08:09,488
Probably gonna switch cars.

90
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,727
It was like taking
candy from a baby.

91
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:17,796
Wh-Where did you
find candy in there?

92
00:08:17,798 --> 00:08:19,297
What?

93
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:21,166
You said you took
candy from a baby.

94
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,301
I don't understand how
there'd be candy and an infant

95
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,337
inside a government laboratory.

96
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,540
Would you just shut up
and pull in over there.

97
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:29,574
Fine.

98
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:31,343
Man, I was a good Jenkins.

99
00:08:31,345 --> 00:08:33,545
I should've been an actor.

100
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,521
All right, I'll stash the stuff.
You find a new set of wheels.

101
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:43,522
All right, will do.

102
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,571
They couldn't just have
vanished into thin air.

103
00:08:59,573 --> 00:09:01,973
They're around here somewhere.
Pull over.

104
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:33,071
Welcome to Toy Wonder Shack,
where all your dreams come true.

105
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,917
- Oh!
- I'm sorry. My bad.

106
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,420
I wasn't watching
where I was going.

107
00:09:50,456 --> 00:09:52,390
Can you help me?

108
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,726
I forgot my son's birthday.

109
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:58,496
I mean, I forgot it until
my wife reminded me of it

110
00:09:58,498 --> 00:10:00,498
20 minutes ago.

111
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,766
You're the expert.

112
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,102
What does
a 13-year-old boy want?

113
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,272
A 13-year-old girl.

114
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:09,774
Yeah...

115
00:10:11,811 --> 00:10:13,111
I don't know, mister.

116
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,413
I think it kind of
depends on the kid.

117
00:10:15,415 --> 00:10:19,050
His birthday's now.
Like today.

118
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:23,588
I have to buy him
the best present ever.

119
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,690
Something really special.

120
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,561
I bet this place goes crazy
at Christmas.

121
00:10:29,563 --> 00:10:34,132
I mean, how often
does a kid turn 13?

122
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:36,301
Science.

123
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:40,005
Science! My boy Chad
loves science.

124
00:10:40,007 --> 00:10:42,407
Do you have any science toys?

125
00:10:42,409 --> 00:10:43,808
Near the back.

126
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,076
Thanks.

127
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,797
Can you go ahead...

128
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,866
Sorry, buddy!
That's my chemistry set.

129
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:17,068
I think you're mistaken.
I just bought it for my son.

130
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,670
Why don't you get another one?

131
00:12:18,672 --> 00:12:21,306
I can't. It's the last one
in the store.

132
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:23,875
Well, I'm sorry,
but this one is mine.

133
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:27,479
Hey, hey, easy, easy, guys.
This is a toy store.

134
00:12:27,481 --> 00:12:30,682
Hey, you stay out of it, buddy.

135
00:12:30,684 --> 00:12:33,685
Um... you know what?

136
00:12:33,687 --> 00:12:36,654
I couldn't help but overhear.
You got a kid, right?

137
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:39,691
Yeah. Today's his birthday,
and I'm running late,

138
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:41,126
so if you'll excuse me.

139
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,695
Well, uh, buddy, um...

140
00:12:43,697 --> 00:12:46,364
I got a kid, too.

141
00:12:46,366 --> 00:12:49,434
Uh, little Janey.
She's so cute.

142
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:51,970
- And she loves chemistry.
- Ha.

143
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,906
And...

144
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:59,310
you don't wanna break a little
girl's heart, now, do you?

145
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:03,114
No, I... But you can
buy her something else.

146
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:08,019
You know what? I can't because
she wants this chemistry set.

147
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,521
So...

148
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:15,093
Look, I don't wanna
have to say this, but...

149
00:13:15,095 --> 00:13:16,327
she's injured.

150
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:20,431
She crashed a car.

151
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,734
Your little girl
was driving a car?

152
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:25,937
She was hitchhiking.

153
00:13:25,939 --> 00:13:28,173
- Oh.
- Oh.

154
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,841
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

155
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:31,309
Mm.

156
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,845
Well, best of luck
to you and Janey.

157
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:34,879
Who?

158
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:37,382
Your little hitchhiking girl.

159
00:13:37,384 --> 00:13:40,785
Right, right. Um...
Hey, you know what?

160
00:13:40,787 --> 00:13:43,755
You know what I loved
when I was a kid? Money.

161
00:13:43,757 --> 00:13:45,957
Right?
Who didn't love money?

162
00:13:45,959 --> 00:13:48,993
I bet your son would love
some cold, hard cash

163
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,361
for his birthday.

164
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:53,731
Right? And then he could
buy whatever he wants.

165
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:55,867
So what'd you pay for that?
What, 20 bucks?

166
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,169
I will give you 50.

167
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:01,072
What am I sayin'?

168
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:02,640
How about 100?

169
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,612
- Yeah!
- All right!

170
00:14:07,614 --> 00:14:08,880
How about 150?

171
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,850
Um...

172
00:14:13,118 --> 00:14:15,320
Will you take a check?

173
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:17,455
No.

174
00:14:17,457 --> 00:14:20,425
Give me that chemistry set!

175
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:28,566
Um, um...

176
00:14:28,568 --> 00:14:31,369
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

177
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,774
Can you giftwrap that for me?

178
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:38,743
You got it.

179
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,816
Kane. It's me.

180
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,618
Did you get the wheels?

181
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,187
Good. Meet me on
the corner of Third.

182
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,756
Near that place.

183
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,491
All right.

184
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:01,733
There's nobody in here.

185
00:15:01,735 --> 00:15:03,668
Let's go.
We gotta keep looking.

186
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,237
Come on.

187
00:15:16,148 --> 00:15:18,750
- Where's the stuff?
- Shut up.

188
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:30,228
Um, hello, Mr. Denning.

189
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,333
Mr. Murdoch! Haven't heard
anything from you today.

190
00:15:35,335 --> 00:15:36,768
I was starting to get worried.

191
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,273
Yeah, sir, there's been
a little complication.

192
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,176
You do have the vials,
don't you?

193
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:48,846
Well, there's... it's...

194
00:15:48,848 --> 00:15:52,650
I know where they are.
They're in a toy store.

195
00:15:55,587 --> 00:15:57,922
I'm not even gonna ask.

196
00:15:57,924 --> 00:16:01,759
Let me just say I need
those vials by tomorrow

197
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:05,163
in order to make
a very important delivery.

198
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,498
I would hate
to be disappointed.

199
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,670
I understand, and I
will not disappoint you.

200
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,808
Make sure that you don't.

201
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,979
So, Murdoch,
we're gonna buy a toy?

202
00:16:22,448 --> 00:16:24,248
Yeah! Yeah, we're getting a toy.

203
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,650
Yeah!

204
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,085
Wanna know what it's called?

205
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,886
A bag o' fist.

206
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,154
You want some?

207
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:32,323
You're so sensitive.

208
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,325
So what are we doing?

209
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,860
We're waiting.

210
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,963
Oh, right, right!

211
00:16:38,965 --> 00:16:40,198
Waiting for what?

212
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,533
Waiting for this guy
to come out of the store.

213
00:16:42,535 --> 00:16:43,868
We're gonna follow him home

214
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,271
and grab the toy chemistry set
from him.

215
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:50,608
Cool. So we are getting a toy.

216
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:54,746
Yeah, yeah.

217
00:16:54,748 --> 00:16:57,482
- I forgot to give you this.
- Oh, yeah?

218
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:58,750
- Yeah.
- What do you got...

219
00:16:58,752 --> 00:17:00,284
There it is!

220
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:02,754
Now shut up!

221
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:07,492
There he is. Let's go!

222
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:10,795
Okay, yeah.

223
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,865
- Seriously?
- Safety first.

224
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,867
- Let's go!
- All right!

225
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,303
Hey, Chad.
How's your birthday so far?

226
00:17:52,305 --> 00:17:53,538
Okay, I guess.

227
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,139
Well, that's good.

228
00:17:55,141 --> 00:17:57,875
What do you say we make dinner
before your mom gets home?

229
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:59,777
- Okay.
- Yeah?

230
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:14,158
Yeah, yeah.

231
00:18:15,727 --> 00:18:18,329
Yes, sir, both vials of serum.

232
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:21,332
Q-96 and P-67 are missing.

233
00:18:21,334 --> 00:18:25,736
The thief knew exactly what
they were looking for and where.

234
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,439
Yes, I do understand.

235
00:18:29,308 --> 00:18:31,943
Oh, Charlie, this is serious.

236
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:34,612
And I've been cleared to
tell you just how serious.

237
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,080
All right, shoot.

238
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:39,217
We've been developing
Q-96 and P-67

239
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:42,520
for international espionage
and infiltration.

240
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,655
The formulas are
multilinguistic intelligence

241
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:47,191
and concealment enhancers.

242
00:18:47,193 --> 00:18:48,726
What's that in English?

243
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,428
That's all I can tell you.

244
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:53,064
Value on
the international market?

245
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:54,232
Priceless.

246
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:56,400
Have your team here
come up with anything?

247
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,337
No. We've run trace DNA,

248
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:01,873
fingerprints,
voice recognition.

249
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,107
We got zip.

250
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:06,477
Can anyone from Washington
be sent down to help us?

251
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,247
The operation's confined
to this team.

252
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:11,549
Outside of Washington,
we're the only ones

253
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:13,451
who knows these chemicals
even exist,

254
00:19:13,453 --> 00:19:15,920
and they want us
to keep it that way.

255
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,922
It's a little late for that.

256
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,524
So where do we go from here?

257
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:21,726
Try to pick up the trail.

258
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:36,307
Looks like the gang's all here.

259
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:38,509
We're up against a gang?

260
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:43,014
Just watch the house.

261
00:20:03,835 --> 00:20:05,536
Hi, honey.
Sorry I'm late.

262
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,939
Work was crazy.

263
00:20:07,941 --> 00:20:11,642
No worries.
Timing is everything.

264
00:20:11,644 --> 00:20:13,144
That sounds good.

265
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:15,913
My mother always told me
to marry a man who could cook.

266
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:18,583
I don't know if this actually
qualifies as cooking,

267
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:20,918
but it is hot,
and there's a lot of it.

268
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,387
So where's our birthday boy?

269
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,757
I don't know. I think he's, uh,
he's around here someplace.

270
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:32,263
Right on cue.

271
00:20:32,265 --> 00:20:33,331
Hi, Mom.

272
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,899
Happy Birthday!

273
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:37,134
- How's your day been?
- Better now.

274
00:20:37,136 --> 00:20:40,104
Good. If you've been
playing with that dog,

275
00:20:40,106 --> 00:20:42,073
you better wash your hands
for dinner.

276
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,541
All right, Mom.

277
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,842
Where your Aunt Ida?

278
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:47,178
Oh, she's in the den,
watching TV.

279
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,312
<i>Judge Joanie?</i>

280
00:20:48,314 --> 00:20:50,248
MMA.

281
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,549
Oh, dear.

282
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,918
I'll go get her.
Do you need any help?

283
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,354
No. I got it all covered.

284
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:58,589
Hands, young man.

285
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:14,338
Ed, I have always admired that
lovely rubber tree plant.

286
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,806
Thank you.

287
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,943
It's a ficus tree, Aunt Ida.

288
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:23,214
Well, of course it is.
Even the dog knows that.

289
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,418
Oh! It has
such a lovely smell.

290
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,454
Kinda like a rainforest.

291
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:32,723
It's an artificial tree.

292
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:35,926
Uh, those are my favorite,
Karen.

293
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:39,130
Sharon. My name is Sharon.

294
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,733
Hey, what'd I tell you
about feeding Abner scraps

295
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:43,768
from the table?

296
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,103
Oh, let Abner eat.

297
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,639
It's his birthday,
for heaven's sake.

298
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:50,574
Abner's the dog, Aunt Ida.

299
00:21:50,576 --> 00:21:54,378
Oh, well, you better not let him
near that rubber tree plant.

300
00:21:55,647 --> 00:21:57,181
Ficus!

301
00:21:57,183 --> 00:21:58,716
Gesundheit!

302
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:06,190
It's time to reconnoiter.

303
00:22:06,192 --> 00:22:07,825
Re-con-what, sir?

304
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:09,860
We're gonna take a look-see.

305
00:22:09,862 --> 00:22:12,530
Look-see? I don't, uh...

306
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:15,299
- Just follow me.
- Right.

307
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,186
Hmm.

308
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:38,756
Well, you certainly have
some lovely neighbors.

309
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,092
Oh, have you seen 'em?

310
00:22:41,094 --> 00:22:42,993
I have now.

311
00:22:57,175 --> 00:23:00,044
You're growing up
so fast, Chad.

312
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,779
I'm a teenager now.

313
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:04,715
Oh, don't say that!

314
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:08,119
You are still my baby!

315
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:10,554
Mom, you're embarrassing me.

316
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,022
Oh, I don't care.

317
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:17,895
Happy Birthday, Chad!

318
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:23,167
Well, have you
thought of a wish?

319
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:26,203
Not yet.
Give me a second.

320
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,016
<i>I have something special</i>
<i>I want to give you</i>

321
00:23:39,018 --> 00:23:41,018
<i>for your birthday, Chad.</i>

322
00:23:43,555 --> 00:23:45,523
Chad?

323
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:46,624
Chad!

324
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:49,126
- Oh.
- The candles?

325
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:50,361
Oh, right.

326
00:23:52,798 --> 00:23:54,231
Happy Birthday, son.

327
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:57,301
Happy Birthday.

328
00:23:57,303 --> 00:23:58,436
Thanks, Mom.

329
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:01,939
What's this?

330
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,278
Oh, boy!

331
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,213
Socks?

332
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,414
And new pajamas.

333
00:24:12,484 --> 00:24:15,619
Oh, wow. I mean, great.

334
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:19,423
When you're older, you'll
appreciate having new clothes.

335
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:20,491
Dad doesn't.

336
00:24:20,493 --> 00:24:23,828
Well, your father's
a special case,

337
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,831
but I haven't
given up hope on him.

338
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,934
Happy Birthday, Abner.

339
00:24:29,936 --> 00:24:32,403
Uh, thanks.

340
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:44,081
Hey! I've been
looking for those!

341
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,583
Where'd you find 'em?

342
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:49,753
Why don't you open the one
that I got for you.

343
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:52,189
Gee, thanks, Dad.

344
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:02,466
Svengoolie's Mad Lab
Chemistry Set!

345
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:03,801
That's totally awesome!

346
00:25:03,803 --> 00:25:07,171
I had to tackle a team of
gomers to get it for you.

347
00:25:07,173 --> 00:25:09,373
I figured you'd really like it.

348
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,443
A box of dangerous chemicals.
Really, Ned?

349
00:25:12,445 --> 00:25:14,078
What are you thinking?

350
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,380
It's perfectly safe.

351
00:25:16,382 --> 00:25:19,049
If anything, Chad's probably
too old for it.

352
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:21,719
No, I'm not.
This is awesome!

353
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:22,953
Can I check it out now?

354
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,121
Sure! I mean...

355
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,090
Sure...

356
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:28,559
if your mother says
that it's okay.

357
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:30,828
All right!

358
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,997
We can save
your cake for later.

359
00:25:32,999 --> 00:25:34,932
Gee, thanks, Mom.

360
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:38,102
Come on, Abner!

361
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,472
A chemistry set?

362
00:25:41,474 --> 00:25:43,941
How do you know he's not
gonna burn the house down?

363
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:46,110
Oh, it's perfectly fine.

364
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,279
I had one when I was a kid,
right, Aunt Ida?

365
00:25:48,281 --> 00:25:49,914
That's right, George.

366
00:25:51,484 --> 00:25:55,052
And I'm sure
that turned out swell.

367
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:56,487
Come on, come on.

368
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:02,660
Come on, boy.

369
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,135
I snuck one more snack for you.

370
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:18,442
Whoa. Look at all
this stuff, Abner.

371
00:26:19,444 --> 00:26:21,445
Sulfur.

372
00:26:21,447 --> 00:26:23,781
I bet that's for making
stink bombs.

373
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,620
Wonder what this is.

374
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:33,223
"C-H-3-C-O-2-H."

375
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,961
Vinegar.

376
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:43,200
"Q-96."

377
00:26:43,202 --> 00:26:45,135
"P-67."

378
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,037
Never heard of 'em.

379
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,339
What do you think?

380
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:54,411
We need some instructions.

381
00:26:54,413 --> 00:26:56,013
Oh, here we go.

382
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,717
This isn't helping.

383
00:26:59,719 --> 00:27:03,053
Half of it's in Chinese,
and half of it's in English.

384
00:27:03,055 --> 00:27:04,388
It's all messed up.

385
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:08,392
I-I mean, I guess
it couldn't hurt.

386
00:27:46,966 --> 00:27:48,165
Okay, Abner, not now.

387
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:49,466
It's hard enough reading this

388
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,635
without you breathing
down my neck.

389
00:27:53,406 --> 00:27:56,507
It says it's supposed
to taste like cotton candy.

390
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,376
Well, it's starting to smell
pretty good.

391
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:01,512
Not exactly
cotton candy, but...

392
00:28:02,314 --> 00:28:04,782
All right, here, smell it.

393
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,085
Whoa! Abner!

394
00:28:08,087 --> 00:28:09,353
You're just supposed
to sniff it.

395
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,754
What's going on in there?

396
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:12,256
Why don't I get to see?

397
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,325
Because I'm the brains,
and you're the bruin.

398
00:28:15,327 --> 00:28:16,760
Ohh!

399
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,970
Chad, do you want
to cut your cake now?

400
00:28:26,972 --> 00:28:28,539
Uh, that's okay, Mom.

401
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,741
Can I do it later?
I'm kind of busy.

402
00:28:30,743 --> 00:28:34,144
Okay. Just don't blow us all
to smithereens.

403
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,646
Give me a break.

404
00:28:35,648 --> 00:28:37,414
Mom, they wouldn't really
put anything dangerous

405
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,150
in a kid's
chemistry set, right?

406
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:42,152
Don't be too sure.

407
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,021
Oh. Don't forget.

408
00:28:44,023 --> 00:28:46,790
We're driving your Aunt Ida back
to Fetal Acres in the morning.

409
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:48,659
Do I have to go?

410
00:28:48,661 --> 00:28:51,028
Yes. We all have to go.

411
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:52,596
All right, Mom.

412
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,936
Boy, Abner, I sure hope
that was safe to drink.

413
00:28:58,938 --> 00:29:01,572
I mean, it's got to be, right?

414
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:04,041
I wonder what it says
in the manual.

415
00:29:04,043 --> 00:29:06,643
Can't even make
heads or tails of this.

416
00:29:06,645 --> 00:29:09,580
I can make tails of it.
And you're right.

417
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:11,515
It is Chinese.
Egg rolls and all.

418
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:15,652
And this so-called English
translation is very amateurish.

419
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,187
Wait. What?

420
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:18,989
I would guess Taiwanese.

421
00:29:18,991 --> 00:29:21,158
Yes, definitely Taiwanese.

422
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,459
Abner, you're talking!

423
00:29:22,461 --> 00:29:25,062
Oh, you're quick, kid.
Real quick!

424
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,063
I'm impressed.

425
00:29:26,065 --> 00:29:27,164
Ah!

426
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:28,365
What? What?

427
00:29:28,367 --> 00:29:30,634
Will you get out of the way?

428
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:36,306
Aah!

429
00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,242
There's no way
this could be happening.

430
00:29:38,244 --> 00:29:41,111
You don't just whip up
a cotton candy formula

431
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,446
out of a dime store
chemistry set

432
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,148
and your dog starts talking.

433
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,084
Obviously. There's a lot more
to this than meets the eye.

434
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:50,087
Chad, I mean, you're not exactly
a rocket scientist, are you?

435
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:53,023
- I mean, no offense.
- None taken.

436
00:29:53,025 --> 00:29:55,359
Wait a minute.

437
00:29:55,361 --> 00:30:01,899
See, I hit my head today
when a bully pushed me.

438
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:05,869
You're not a talking dog.

439
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:08,438
You're just a whacked-out
hallucination.

440
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,141
Whacked-out? I think
I've just been insulted.

441
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,911
Abner, you are not
a talking dog.

442
00:30:13,913 --> 00:30:15,279
Have it your way.

443
00:30:15,281 --> 00:30:17,214
Mom! Dad!

444
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:21,785
What's wrong, son?

445
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,253
Poison gas.

446
00:30:23,255 --> 00:30:25,022
I smell poison gas.

447
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,857
Ned, it's that chemistry set.

448
00:30:26,859 --> 00:30:30,360
No! It's Abner.

449
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:35,132
I smell cotton candy
and vinegar.

450
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:37,134
My baby.

451
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:40,337
Are you all right?
Speak to me.

452
00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:41,672
You're crushing me, Mom.

453
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,975
I'm fine.

454
00:30:44,977 --> 00:30:47,511
It's Abner. He...

455
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,279
Oh, son.

456
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:51,849
It is not uncommon for a dog

457
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:55,285
to let loose a little gas
every now and then.

458
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:58,789
That, my friend,
is exactly why we do not

459
00:30:58,791 --> 00:31:02,059
feed him people food
from the table.

460
00:31:02,061 --> 00:31:04,161
That is wicked.

461
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:05,662
No, it's not gas.

462
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,999
I created this formula,
and Abner drank it,

463
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,500
and now he can talk.

464
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:11,702
Mmm.

465
00:31:11,704 --> 00:31:13,737
- Abner can talk.
- Oh.

466
00:31:13,739 --> 00:31:15,839
Well, trust me, honey,

467
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:19,009
the only talking that Abner's
doing is out of his butt.

468
00:31:19,011 --> 00:31:21,078
He can read Chinese, too.

469
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,846
Show him, boy.

470
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:27,551
Actions speak louder
than words.

471
00:31:27,553 --> 00:31:29,519
No, but he does talk.

472
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:33,056
Abner, please, just speak.
Speak!

473
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,860
All right, very funny,
young man.

474
00:31:36,862 --> 00:31:39,396
No. Maybe he's just
a little shy.

475
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,831
I've had about enough of this!

476
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,467
One more sound
out of either of you,

477
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,002
and you're grounded.

478
00:31:45,004 --> 00:31:46,069
But, Mom!

479
00:31:46,071 --> 00:31:49,306
Chad, I'm surprised at you, son.

480
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,341
No more jokes.

481
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,845
And no more
science experiments, okay?

482
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:58,115
We have an early day tomorrow,
and it's time for bed.

483
00:31:58,117 --> 00:32:01,652
Lights out
in 10 minutes, mister.

484
00:32:01,654 --> 00:32:04,288
And open a window, will ya?

485
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:24,007
You know, for a minute there
I really thought you could talk.

486
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,577
I really believed
you were smart.

487
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,713
Smart enough to know
when I keep my mouth shut.

488
00:32:29,715 --> 00:32:31,248
You should try it
sometime, Chad.

489
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,583
But why didn't you
say anything to my parents?

490
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:36,787
Now they think I'm some
sort of practical joker.

491
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,790
Ah, they'll get over it.
You're a kid.

492
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:41,425
You're expected
to do dumb stuff.

493
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,026
But a talking dog?

494
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,028
No one's expecting that.

495
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,396
- Yeah?
- Yes.

496
00:32:46,398 --> 00:32:47,931
What do you think's gonna
happen to me

497
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,533
if anyone finds out about this?

498
00:32:49,535 --> 00:32:50,801
I don't know.

499
00:32:50,803 --> 00:32:52,469
You'll get your own
reality TV show?

500
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,038
Worse than that.
They'll take me away for sure.

501
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,108
And you and me would probably
never see each other again.

502
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,377
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah, wow.

503
00:33:00,379 --> 00:33:02,579
So put your smart pants on
and let's agree:

504
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:04,614
Mum's the word, right?

505
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,916
Right.

506
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:08,085
Trust me,

507
00:33:08,087 --> 00:33:11,021
you ain't gonna believe
what I just seen.

508
00:33:11,023 --> 00:33:13,223
Try me.

509
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:15,826
Th-The dog...

510
00:33:18,062 --> 00:33:19,963
He can talk.

511
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:21,665
Dog?

512
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,367
What dog?

513
00:33:23,369 --> 00:33:25,335
- The boy's dog.
- What boy?

514
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,270
The boy with the chemistry set.

515
00:33:27,272 --> 00:33:28,805
What chemistry set?

516
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:31,875
The chemistry set that
I stashed the two vials in

517
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,976
that we stole.

518
00:33:32,978 --> 00:33:36,046
Ah, I see.

519
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:44,187
Now, did this talking dog
drink any of the formula?

520
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:45,856
All right.

521
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:50,193
Now, did this talking dog also
drink the other vial as well?

522
00:33:50,195 --> 00:33:53,263
Uh, I don't think so, no.

523
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,632
Good, good, good, good.

524
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:58,335
So this is what we're gonna do.

525
00:33:58,337 --> 00:34:00,570
Since one vial is already gone,

526
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:03,807
you and Mr. Kane are gonna
kidnap the talking dog

527
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:06,777
so that we can analyze it
and hopefully recreate

528
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:12,649
the formula that you two idiots
so foolishly let get away.

529
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:14,851
Right. All right.

530
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:18,889
What are we gonna do with the
dog once you're done with it?

531
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,891
Sadly we'll have
to put the dog down

532
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,426
so we can properly analyze it.

533
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:23,994
There's just no other way.

534
00:34:23,996 --> 00:34:26,730
You will also acquire
the remaining vial,

535
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:29,399
and you will bring it to me.

536
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:31,068
Now, uh...

537
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,238
this boy with the dog,

538
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,075
is he home... alone?

539
00:34:38,077 --> 00:34:41,078
Unfortunately his parents
are around.

540
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,646
All right.

541
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:45,515
Watch the house
until the parents go out

542
00:34:45,517 --> 00:34:47,918
and then initiate the plan.

543
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,420
Right. What plan?

544
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,422
The plan we just discussed!

545
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:54,458
Right, of course, Boss.

546
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,727
Yeah, I mean,
he just said the...

547
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:01,298
I was just thinking
about the dog, you know?

548
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,233
What, are you afraid of dogs?

549
00:35:03,235 --> 00:35:06,103
- Uh, no.
- Good.

550
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:08,105
Now, fetch!

551
00:35:08,107 --> 00:35:09,739
Right, Boss.

552
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,578
Glad we had this talk.

553
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,061
All right, your turn.

554
00:35:39,338 --> 00:35:41,571
Come on.

555
00:35:45,243 --> 00:35:47,577
There you go!

556
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:50,413
What'd you do that for?

557
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,048
Your turn to watch the house.

558
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,819
Hey, look, there's some melted
cheese stuck on this.

559
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:57,687
You're disgusting.

560
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,860
Rise and shine, son.

561
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:07,097
Remember, we gotta take Aunt Ida
to the home today.

562
00:36:07,099 --> 00:36:10,100
Oh. I just remembered.

563
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:13,937
I have a science project that's
due first thing Monday morning.

564
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:17,174
Hmm. And you just now
remembered.

565
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:20,410
Well, yeah, I guess with all
the birthday excitement,

566
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:22,512
it must have slipped my mind.

567
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,920
I don't like the sound of this,

568
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:31,788
but I'll see if I can
convince your mom

569
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,358
to let you stay home
and work on your project.

570
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,260
Gee, thanks.

571
00:36:37,262 --> 00:36:39,963
Well, you are 13.

572
00:36:39,965 --> 00:36:42,299
I think you're old enough
to take care of yourself,

573
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:44,901
for a few hours anyway.

574
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:48,538
Don't forget,
if you need anything,

575
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,340
give us a call.

576
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,675
I sure will, Dad.

577
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:53,677
And thanks for trusting me.

578
00:36:53,679 --> 00:36:55,645
Oh, and, Dad?

579
00:36:55,647 --> 00:36:56,746
Yeah, son.

580
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,848
Sorry about last night.

581
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:01,384
You know, the talking dog stuff
and all.

582
00:37:01,386 --> 00:37:02,752
It's okay, Chad.

583
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:04,087
You're a kid.

584
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:06,456
You're expected
to do dumb stuff.

585
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,325
That's just what he said.

586
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:10,160
Who?

587
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:12,062
Just some guy on TV.

588
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,199
See ya later, champ.

589
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,510
I think you handled that
very well.

590
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:28,745
I'm proud of you.

591
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:31,348
Well, what do we do now?

592
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,550
Did you just...

593
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:36,753
Hey, if you're smart,
you'll let me go outside.

594
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,521
It's been a long night,
you know.

595
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:40,991
Oh, right, yeah.
Well, come on.

596
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:47,430
Ooh...

597
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:49,065
So this is where they beat us.

598
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:52,035
Well, maybe somebody saw them.

599
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:54,004
We should canvass the area.

600
00:37:54,006 --> 00:37:55,972
All right, but I have to call
the director first.

601
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:59,209
Okay, but if anybody's asking,

602
00:37:59,211 --> 00:38:02,646
tell 'em I'm doing
a bang-up job, okay?

603
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:09,152
<i>Good morning, Jackie.</i>

604
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:10,053
Good morning, sir.

605
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:11,488
We've located their vehicle.

606
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:14,758
I think the thieves
probably took off on foot.

607
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,893
Now, we are searching
the immediate area,

608
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,296
but I don't think we're
gonna find them here.

609
00:38:19,298 --> 00:38:21,731
At best, maybe someone
can identify them

610
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,667
or maybe there was
a security camera

611
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:25,735
that got a clean image
we can use.

612
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,737
I'll call you
as soon as I learn anything.

613
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,706
<i>- You do that.</i>
- Oh, and, sir?

614
00:38:29,708 --> 00:38:32,942
Charlie's doing
a really bang-up job.

615
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,111
<i>No one's asking, Jackie.</i>

616
00:38:35,113 --> 00:38:36,246
Right.

617
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:47,057
I tell ya, Fred,
you'll never get a girl

618
00:38:47,059 --> 00:38:50,660
driving around in
a crappy-looking car like that.

619
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,961
I already have a girl,
Aunt Ida.

620
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:53,396
Well, you'll never
get rid of her

621
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:56,533
driving around in
a crappy-looking car like that.

622
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:59,069
I call shotgun.

623
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,206
Murdoch. Murdoch.

624
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,141
- Murdoch!
- What? What? What?

625
00:39:05,143 --> 00:39:08,845
You told me to wake you up
when the family left.

626
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:14,718
Oh.

627
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:16,419
Good boy, Kane.

628
00:39:39,577 --> 00:39:41,277
Come on.

629
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,961
Tell me again.
Why are we doing this?

630
00:39:57,963 --> 00:40:00,663
Obviously we have something
far more advanced

631
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:02,132
than your dad
ever bargained for.

632
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:05,135
We might be wise to discover
exactly what it is.

633
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,637
Well, what if it turns you into
a monster or something?

634
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,239
This is powerful stuff.

635
00:40:09,241 --> 00:40:13,076
It certainly does pack a little
bang for your buck at 29.99.

636
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:16,613
That's amazing. How do you
know how much it costs?

637
00:40:16,615 --> 00:40:18,248
I have psychic powers.

638
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,749
Wow!

639
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:22,385
That, and your dad left
the price tag on it.

640
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:25,255
Oh. Right.

641
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:30,126
Are you sure
you wanna try this?

642
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,129
Phew!

643
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:35,465
Smells like the butt
of that Scottish Terrier

644
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:36,466
down the street.

645
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,734
Is that bad?

646
00:40:37,736 --> 00:40:40,370
Well, not exactly.
Bottom's up.

647
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:48,411
Not terrible.

648
00:40:48,413 --> 00:40:50,013
How do you feel?

649
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:51,781
Sorry!

650
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:53,750
You're excused.

651
00:40:53,752 --> 00:40:56,286
Ooh. My stomach's
a little upset.

652
00:40:56,288 --> 00:40:58,888
I think I'm gonna need
to eat some grass.

653
00:40:58,890 --> 00:41:00,890
I feel like
I'm fading fast, kid.

654
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,294
Abner, you just
turned invisible!

655
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,529
Wha...

656
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:07,997
Whazza...

657
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,933
- Am I dreaming?
- Can't be.

658
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,568
Would you just shh!

659
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,437
Shh.

660
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:17,574
<i>Wow! That's some birthday gift</i>
<i>you got there.</i>

661
00:41:17,576 --> 00:41:20,810
This is all starting to get
very, very weird.

662
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:24,180
<i>Oh, now it's starting</i>
<i>to get weird. Really? Now?</i>

663
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,882
And you're not helping, either.

664
00:41:25,884 --> 00:41:27,317
<i>Well, what do you</i>
<i>expect me to do?</i>

665
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:30,420
I don't know.
I need to think.

666
00:41:36,927 --> 00:41:39,562
<i>Well, well, well!</i>
<i>What have we here?</i>

667
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,067
Aah!

668
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,105
Don't touch, you...

669
00:41:49,107 --> 00:41:51,441
- We gotta get outta here.
- Right, let's go.

670
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:52,976
Come on!

671
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,421
<i>Come on, Chad.</i>
<i>Get this thing off me.</i>

672
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,990
It sure would make me
feel better

673
00:42:06,992 --> 00:42:08,791
if you kept your dog collar on.

674
00:42:08,793 --> 00:42:11,027
<i>Like that wouldn't attract</i>
<i>any attention.</i>

675
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:13,663
<i>Relax, kid.</i>
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

676
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,798
All right, but this
makes me very nervous.

677
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:18,535
<i>Look, I'm not just some</i>
<i>dumb dog anymore, all right?</i>

678
00:42:18,537 --> 00:42:20,103
<i>I'm as smart as you are,</i>
<i>so lay off the...</i>

679
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,504
<i>Oh!</i>

680
00:42:21,506 --> 00:42:24,240
<i>Did someone just say cat?</i>
<i>Gotta go!</i>

681
00:42:24,242 --> 00:42:25,608
Abner, no!

682
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:27,043
Wait!

683
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:41,991
Abner! Abner!
Come here!

684
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:46,095
Abner, you just turned visible
again, then invisible.

685
00:42:46,097 --> 00:42:47,864
How did you do that?

686
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:50,500
<i>I don't know. I had my mind</i>
<i>on more important things.</i>

687
00:42:50,502 --> 00:42:52,001
Well, do it again.

688
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:53,670
<i>Yeah, got nothing.</i>

689
00:42:53,672 --> 00:42:55,905
- That was freaky.
-<i> Yeah.</i>

690
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:57,140
<i>And the cat got away, too.</i>

691
00:42:57,142 --> 00:42:59,208
What's up with that?

692
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:02,011
First I thought you were
all smart and civilized,

693
00:43:02,013 --> 00:43:04,147
but you're still
chasing after cats.

694
00:43:04,149 --> 00:43:07,584
<i>Cats would be running the world</i>
<i>if it wasn't for guys like me.</i>

695
00:43:07,586 --> 00:43:09,686
<i>You can't ever</i>
<i>let your guard down.</i>

696
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:11,154
Really? Cats?

697
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:13,556
<i>Oh, yeah! Cats!</i>

698
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:40,283
<i>Don't blow it, Chad.</i>

699
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,454
- What?
- <i>Don't blow it.</i>

700
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:47,090
<i>If those two jerks</i>
<i>Josh and Kevin show up again,</i>

701
00:43:47,092 --> 00:43:48,658
<i>stand up to them.</i>

702
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,026
<i>Don't be such a weenie.</i>

703
00:43:50,028 --> 00:43:51,394
All right.

704
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:54,530
Hi, Chad.

705
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:55,698
Hello, Sophie.

706
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,033
How was your birthday?

707
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:58,468
Great.

708
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,971
What are we gonna tell
the boss?

709
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,077
- It's the boss.
- Yeah.

710
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:11,047
Hey, Boss, I was just
about to call you.

711
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:14,117
Um, no, the vial is empty,

712
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:17,754
and we don't see
the talking dog.

713
00:44:17,756 --> 00:44:21,190
No, he's here, all right.
We just don't... see him.

714
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:22,725
He's a see-through pooch.

715
00:44:22,727 --> 00:44:25,962
<i>What are you two nimrods</i>
<i>hanging around for?</i>

716
00:44:25,964 --> 00:44:27,463
Yeah, that's right.

717
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:32,669
The dog drank the other vial,
and then...

718
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:34,103
he went invisible.

719
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:35,705
Like in the movies.

720
00:44:35,707 --> 00:44:39,475
No, no, no. We were all set
to kidnap the dog,

721
00:44:39,477 --> 00:44:41,878
but that's when he kinda
went invisible on us.

722
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:45,314
<i>You two were gonna kidnap me.</i>
<i>You gotta be dreaming.</i>

723
00:44:45,316 --> 00:44:47,350
- <i>You and what army?</i>
- The kid?

724
00:44:47,352 --> 00:44:48,885
He's not gonna be a problem.

725
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:50,520
And as far as this mangy mutt,

726
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:53,389
all we gotta do is find out
exactly where he is,

727
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:55,792
and then we'll grab him.
No problem.

728
00:44:55,794 --> 00:44:58,294
<i>Oh, you just wanted</i>
<i>to know where I am?</i>

729
00:44:58,296 --> 00:45:00,563
<i>Well, why didn't you say so?</i>

730
00:45:00,565 --> 00:45:02,365
We're gonna get that fleabag.

731
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,634
No, it's just
an expression, Boss.

732
00:45:04,636 --> 00:45:05,535
Uh, Murdoch?

733
00:45:05,537 --> 00:45:06,969
- Would you shut up?
- No...

734
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:08,337
<i>Wet marks the spot.</i>

735
00:45:08,339 --> 00:45:12,041
No, not you, Boss.
I would never...

736
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:15,144
Yeah, no problem.
We're on our way.

737
00:45:15,146 --> 00:45:16,546
The boss wants to see us.

738
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:17,914
You might wanna
change your pants.

739
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:19,115
Why?

740
00:45:21,085 --> 00:45:22,885
What did you do to me?

741
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,454
No, it wasn't me.

742
00:45:24,456 --> 00:45:25,455
Heh heh heh heh!

743
00:45:25,457 --> 00:45:26,522
Ow!

744
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:30,493
- Get in the car!
- All right.

745
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,995
I'm really sorry
about yesterday.

746
00:45:32,997 --> 00:45:35,565
Josh and Kevin are real jerks.

747
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,266
Then why do you
hang out with them?

748
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:39,135
I don't hang out with them.

749
00:45:39,137 --> 00:45:41,137
Well, not really.

750
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,372
I just don't wanna
make them mad.

751
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,475
Can we talk about
something else?

752
00:45:45,477 --> 00:45:46,743
Oh, yeah, sure.

753
00:45:46,745 --> 00:45:50,413
So I was thinking about
what you said about the sky

754
00:45:50,415 --> 00:45:51,914
and why it looks so blue.

755
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:54,984
Well, I looked it up online,
and you were right.

756
00:45:54,986 --> 00:45:57,053
But I already knew
you would be.

757
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,956
Well, I've been interested
in science and all that stuff

758
00:45:59,958 --> 00:46:01,491
for a long time already.

759
00:46:01,493 --> 00:46:04,327
Oh, I also learned something
else that's really cool.

760
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:07,497
Did you know that
moonlight doesn't exist?

761
00:46:07,499 --> 00:46:09,132
It's just sunlight
reflected off the moon,

762
00:46:09,134 --> 00:46:10,633
like a giant mirror.

763
00:46:10,635 --> 00:46:11,834
You don't say.

764
00:46:11,836 --> 00:46:12,935
Mm-hmm.

765
00:46:12,937 --> 00:46:14,937
Well, not like
a mirror-mirror

766
00:46:14,939 --> 00:46:17,206
because it takes sunlight
over eight minutes

767
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,875
just to reach the earth.

768
00:46:18,877 --> 00:46:21,310
So if the sun burned out,

769
00:46:21,312 --> 00:46:22,879
we wouldn't know for
another eight minutes?

770
00:46:22,881 --> 00:46:26,249
Yeah! And then we'd all be dead!
Isn't that cool?

771
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:29,585
It is! That's the coolest thing
I've ever heard.

772
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:35,057
Well, I gotta get going.

773
00:46:35,059 --> 00:46:37,293
It was nice
talking to you, Chad.

774
00:46:42,266 --> 00:46:45,301
<i>Who would've thought</i>
<i>she was as big a dork as you?</i>

775
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,836
Shut up. She'll hear you.

776
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:50,006
<i>Chad, buddy, we might have</i>
<i>a little problem.</i>

777
00:46:50,008 --> 00:46:51,741
Oh, really? Just one?

778
00:46:51,743 --> 00:46:54,644
<i>Yeah. Let's get inside,</i>
<i>and I'll tell you about it.</i>

779
00:46:58,415 --> 00:47:01,017
<i>Why don't you lock that?</i>

780
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,718
What's gotten into you?

781
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,854
<i>While you were striking out</i>
<i>with the homecoming queen,</i>

782
00:47:04,856 --> 00:47:08,224
<i>I happened to overhear those</i>
<i>two plotting to kidnap me.</i>

783
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:09,926
Kidnap you? No way.

784
00:47:09,928 --> 00:47:12,562
<i>Oh, way. I think it has</i>
<i>something to do</i>

785
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:14,564
<i>with those chemicals</i>
<i>of yours I drank.</i>

786
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:17,200
Oh, Abner, I'm... I'm so sorry.

787
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:18,634
<i>Ah, don't worry about, kid.</i>

788
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,636
<i>Those morons</i>
<i>couldn't catch a cold.</i>

789
00:47:20,638 --> 00:47:22,638
<i>Besides, there's things out</i>
<i>there a lot more dangerous.</i>

790
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:25,007
- <i>Trust me.</i>
- I'll bet.

791
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:28,277
<i>Yeah! Anyone ever threaten</i>
<i>to have you fixed?</i>

792
00:47:28,279 --> 00:47:30,413
<i>That's one word</i>
<i>that sends a shiver</i>

793
00:47:30,415 --> 00:47:32,682
<i>down the bones of every canine.</i>

794
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,017
- No kidding.
- <i>And besides,</i>

795
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,453
<i>there's this drop-dead</i>
<i>gorgeous Afghan one block over</i>

796
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:39,522
<i>that I've been dying</i>
<i>to sneak up on.</i>

797
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:42,325
Really?
I would've never guessed.

798
00:47:42,327 --> 00:47:44,360
The one with the long,
silky hair?

799
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:47,029
<i>She's on my radar, pal.</i>
<i>She's on it.</i>

800
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:50,466
Okay, cool your jets, Abner.
All we have to do now is

801
00:47:50,468 --> 00:47:52,535
wait for Mom and Dad
to get home.

802
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:55,304
<i>Cool. Hey, what's on TV?</i>

803
00:47:57,107 --> 00:47:58,474
Uh-huh.

804
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,223
Afternoon, Mr. Denning.

805
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:19,662
Ah, gentlemen, gentlemen!
Please sit down, sit down.

806
00:48:21,665 --> 00:48:24,767
Baby, these are
my close associates.

807
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,903
Murdoch, Candi.

808
00:48:26,905 --> 00:48:28,371
Candi, Kane.

809
00:48:29,706 --> 00:48:31,440
Candy cane?

810
00:48:31,442 --> 00:48:32,942
A pleasure, I'm sure.

811
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:35,211
Do they call you Candi
'cause you're so sweet?

812
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:37,613
No, silly. They call me Candi

813
00:48:37,615 --> 00:48:40,216
'cause too much of me
will rot your teeth.

814
00:48:40,218 --> 00:48:41,751
Ha!

815
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:43,352
Can I get you boys
anything to drink?

816
00:48:43,354 --> 00:48:45,321
- Oh, yeah.
- Mickey, two iced teas.

817
00:48:45,323 --> 00:48:46,656
Okay.

818
00:48:49,393 --> 00:48:53,062
Now, as you can imagine,

819
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:57,300
I am less than thrilled
with your lack of progress.

820
00:48:57,302 --> 00:49:01,604
But then I realize
it's been my own fault.

821
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:06,309
Boys, accept
my deepest apology.

822
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:08,644
Of course, Boss,
yeah, sure, anytime.

823
00:49:08,646 --> 00:49:11,681
Yeah, yeah,
we all make mistakes, right?

824
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:12,815
Right.

825
00:49:12,817 --> 00:49:15,985
You both are like brothers
to me. Truly.

826
00:49:15,987 --> 00:49:19,822
And I want you to succeed,
and I want you to make me proud.

827
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,627
Ohh!

828
00:49:24,629 --> 00:49:31,233
And the reason I believe you
have failed me so miserably

829
00:49:31,235 --> 00:49:34,637
is because I haven't given you
the proper tools to work with.

830
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:37,239
- Mm.
- Aah! Aah!

831
00:49:37,241 --> 00:49:40,376
So I'm gonna rectify
that situation right now.

832
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:47,616
Look closely.
Pay particular attention.

833
00:49:48,752 --> 00:49:51,654
This is an electronic
jamming device.

834
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,023
It delivers a microwave burst

835
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:56,125
that disables all
cell phone signals

836
00:49:56,127 --> 00:49:58,995
within a five-block radius.

837
00:49:58,997 --> 00:50:00,262
Wow. Look at that.

838
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,031
Would you... It's delicate!

839
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:08,070
Sorry, Boss.

840
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,441
Now, listen.
The only downside,

841
00:50:12,443 --> 00:50:14,043
the effect only lasts
for 30 minutes,

842
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,945
but that should be
ample enough time

843
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:19,181
to get into the house
and locate me what I desire

844
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,884
because if you don't,

845
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:25,187
I'm gonna find
two new brothers.

846
00:50:25,189 --> 00:50:28,491
Well, uh, how...
how do we get in?

847
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,128
Be clever... if you can.

848
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:34,397
Try thinking outside the box.

849
00:50:37,567 --> 00:50:42,538
May I suggest, um,
a little disguise?

850
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:45,541
Oh! I love disguises!

851
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,577
- You do?
- Yes!

852
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:52,782
Why don't you impersonate
some kind of servicemen?

853
00:50:52,784 --> 00:50:56,452
Oh! Like pretend
to be soldiers!

854
00:50:56,454 --> 00:50:57,920
No, you numbskull.

855
00:50:57,922 --> 00:51:00,156
He's talking about dressing up
like repairmen.

856
00:51:00,158 --> 00:51:01,624
Exactly.

857
00:51:01,626 --> 00:51:03,859
- See?
- Now...

858
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:08,564
you both know what to do,
so you should go do it.

859
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:11,434
And, gentlemen,
thank you for taking time

860
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:15,905
out of your obviously
very, very busy day.

861
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:19,375
Of course, Boss, anytime.
Anytime at all.

862
00:51:19,377 --> 00:51:21,777
Uh, pleasure meeting you, miss.

863
00:51:21,779 --> 00:51:24,647
Likewise, I'm sure.

864
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:27,583
- Come on!
- Jeez!

865
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,719
We'll see you later, Boss,

866
00:51:30,721 --> 00:51:33,255
So what do you think?
Cowboys and Indians?

867
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,723
I'll be Pocahontas.

868
00:51:34,725 --> 00:51:36,926
Ooh. I'll be Crazy Horse.

869
00:51:40,664 --> 00:51:43,165
Mom says you're not supposed
to be on the couch.

870
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:46,001
<i>Oh, please. I'm not supposed</i>
<i>to be on the couch?</i>

871
00:51:46,003 --> 00:51:47,770
<i>No one's home.</i>
<i>Who cares?</i>

872
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,805
What are you looking for?

873
00:51:49,807 --> 00:51:51,340
<i>Stupid cable guide.</i>

874
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:54,510
<i>70 channels and still</i>
<i>nothing worth watching.</i>

875
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,912
Oh, maybe we can get
Animal Channel.

876
00:51:56,914 --> 00:51:59,315
We can even catch
<i>Puppies in Purgatory.</i>

877
00:51:59,317 --> 00:52:02,051
<i>I was hoping to find</i>
The Hound of the Baskervilles.

878
00:52:02,053 --> 00:52:04,153
<i>That one's always good</i>
<i>for a laugh.</i>

879
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,790
There's gotta be
something decent on.

880
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,358
Let me flip through
the channels again.

881
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:12,328
<i>You just did that. I tell you,</i>
<i>people are so weird.</i>

882
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:13,896
What do you mean?

883
00:52:13,898 --> 00:52:16,532
<i>You all just do weird things,</i>
<i>that's all.</i>

884
00:52:16,534 --> 00:52:20,736
- Such as?
- <i>Such as ripping a big fart</i>

885
00:52:20,738 --> 00:52:23,005
<i>at the dinner table</i>
<i>and blaming it on the dog.</i>

886
00:52:23,007 --> 00:52:25,374
<i>"The dog did it!"</i>
<i>It's always the dog!</i>

887
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:26,942
<i>Come on, last Thanksgiving,</i>

888
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:29,845
<i>everyone knows it was Aunt Ida</i>
<i>clearing the runway.</i>

889
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:33,315
Yeah, and who is it this time?

890
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,750
<i>Well, okay, that one's on me,</i>

891
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:36,852
<i>but the exception</i>
<i>proves the rule.</i>

892
00:52:36,854 --> 00:52:39,288
Uh-huh.

893
00:52:42,093 --> 00:52:45,628
Hey, it's<i> The Creature</i>
<i>from Galaxy 7.</i>

894
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,531
<i>Ooh! Leave this one on.</i>
<i>I like it.</i>

895
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:55,037
There.

896
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,678
- Yeah.
- Good, good.

897
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,385
That's funny.

898
00:53:09,387 --> 00:53:11,220
I wonder why we
lost the signal.

899
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:13,255
<i>Beats me. I'm gonna</i>
<i>wash down this popcorn</i>

900
00:53:13,257 --> 00:53:14,924
<i>with some nice, cold water.</i>

901
00:53:14,926 --> 00:53:17,326
You going to drink out of
the toilet again, aren't you?

902
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:19,528
<i>Don't knock it</i>
<i>till you tried it, kid.</i>

903
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:21,263
Yeah, I'll take your word
for it.

904
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:31,740
Stop it!

905
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,409
I wonder who that is.

906
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,077
<i>I think I know.</i>

907
00:53:40,417 --> 00:53:42,084
Can I help you?

908
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,219
Uh, cable guys.

909
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:45,588
We're doing a little
scheduled work

910
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:47,656
on the lines
in your neighborhood.

911
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:51,727
Let me ask you,
are you getting a signal?

912
00:53:51,729 --> 00:53:54,396
Well, we were, but not anymore.

913
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,764
Good!

914
00:53:55,766 --> 00:53:57,166
<i>What's going on?</i>

915
00:53:57,168 --> 00:54:01,036
Cable guys. Some sort of
scheduled maintenance.

916
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:03,372
<i>Get real.</i>
<i>Cable guys never,</i>

917
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:06,609
<i>and I mean never show up</i>
<i>when they're scheduled to.</i>

918
00:54:06,611 --> 00:54:08,010
Now that you mention it...

919
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:10,379
You know what?
Would you just let us come in,

920
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:13,215
and we can get fix it
right away, real fast.

921
00:54:13,217 --> 00:54:15,217
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, kid?

922
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:16,619
I sure would.

923
00:54:16,621 --> 00:54:19,255
<i>Stranger danger.</i>

924
00:54:19,257 --> 00:54:21,190
But I can't.

925
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:23,859
You'll have to wait
till my folks get home.

926
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:26,195
Can you at least
just sign the work order

927
00:54:26,197 --> 00:54:27,696
so we can reschedule?

928
00:54:27,698 --> 00:54:29,198
I guess so.

929
00:54:33,203 --> 00:54:35,604
<i>Don't let 'em in!</i>

930
00:54:37,608 --> 00:54:39,808
<i>Lock the door!</i>
<i>Lock the door!</i>

931
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:45,948
Ow!

932
00:54:48,151 --> 00:54:50,853
Please tell me you didn't
just cripple the cable guy.

933
00:54:50,855 --> 00:54:52,621
Why did you do that?

934
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:56,025
<i>My super Fido senses told me</i>
<i>something fishy was going on.</i>

935
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:58,193
- Really?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

936
00:54:58,195 --> 00:55:00,629
<i>Those are the two guys</i>
<i>I overheard outside</i>

937
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,998
<i>plotting to do</i>
<i>a little dog-napping.</i>

938
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,434
You mean those two cable guys
were phonies?

939
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:10,272
<i>Let's find out what's going on.</i>
<i>Follow my voice.</i>

940
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:11,640
Okay.

941
00:55:11,642 --> 00:55:14,143
<i>Whoops! Sorry.</i>

942
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:22,384
<i>Look! It's the Two Stooges.</i>

943
00:55:22,386 --> 00:55:23,752
What are they doing?

944
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,355
<i>Sorry, chum, I can't read lips.</i>

945
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,692
What are we gonna do,
call the cops?

946
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:32,828
<i>Well, they haven't actually</i>
<i>done anything yet.</i>

947
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,697
<i>I think it's time to do</i>
<i>a little spying.</i>

948
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:37,466
<i>Let me sneak out the back door,</i>
<i>and I'll check 'em out.</i>

949
00:55:37,468 --> 00:55:38,934
- Let me ask you. What's this?
- I don't know.

950
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:42,171
That! You know what?
Get over there!

951
00:55:42,173 --> 00:55:44,673
Are you gonna call the boss
and tell him we can't get in?

952
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,275
- Not on your life.
- Right.

953
00:55:46,277 --> 00:55:48,777
I don't want to be one of
the boss's ex-brothers.

954
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,446
Me neither.

955
00:55:50,448 --> 00:55:54,650
Now, let's retrace our steps.

956
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:58,520
First, we stole
the top secret chemicals

957
00:55:58,522 --> 00:55:59,655
from that government lab.

958
00:55:59,657 --> 00:56:00,756
Right.

959
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,891
Then that kid gets 'em,

960
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:05,694
and they're gobbled up
by that goofy dog.

961
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,796
<i>Goofy?</i>
<i>Who are you calling goofy?</i>

962
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,331
- What'd you say?
- What?

963
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:10,332
- Huh?
- Who?

964
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:12,201
- What?
- Shut up!

965
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:17,773
I'm thinking third,
we break into the house,

966
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,109
kidnap the dog,
bring him back to the boss

967
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:21,944
so we can analyze his blood.

968
00:56:21,946 --> 00:56:23,545
Yeah, see, that's the part
I don't like.

969
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:25,614
I don't like that they
gotta put the dog down

970
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:28,183
so they can analyze it.
I like dogs.

971
00:56:28,185 --> 00:56:32,421
Yeah, me, too, but who's
gonna tell that to the boss?

972
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:33,622
You?

973
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:34,690
Not me.

974
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:36,625
<i>Hey, look out behind you!</i>

975
00:56:36,627 --> 00:56:38,394
Ohh! Something
just bit my butt!

976
00:56:38,396 --> 00:56:39,862
- It's the dog!
- What?

977
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:41,697
- Grab him!
- Grab him? Where?

978
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:42,965
<i>Over here!</i>

979
00:56:42,967 --> 00:56:44,466
- Whoa!
- Over there!

980
00:56:49,973 --> 00:56:52,474
<i>Coming through, boys!</i>

981
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,747
- <i>Stumblebums!</i>
- There he is!

982
00:57:00,517 --> 00:57:03,652
<i>I've always said the paw</i>
<i>is quicker than the eye.</i>

983
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:04,887
Ahh...

984
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:10,259
<i>The trouble with you guys is</i>
<i>you're just not dog people.</i>

985
00:57:16,032 --> 00:57:17,466
<i>Watch it, fellas.</i>

986
00:57:17,468 --> 00:57:21,136
<i>You might just step</i>
<i>in something. Hee hee!</i>

987
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,273
<i>Here. Let me give you</i>
<i>a little leg up.</i>

988
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:26,475
Aah! Aah!

989
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:31,847
There he is!

990
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,081
Uh-oh!

991
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,285
Chad! Chad! Let me in!

992
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,822
- Come on, come on!
- <i>Quick! Close it!</i>

993
00:57:51,501 --> 00:57:53,769
They almost got you when
you turned visible again.

994
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,437
You think that stuff
is unstable?

995
00:57:55,439 --> 00:57:57,573
<i>Maybe it was never stable</i>
<i>to begin with.</i>

996
00:57:57,575 --> 00:58:00,275
Maybe, but either way,
that was a close call.

997
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:01,710
<i>I knew something was up</i>
<i>with those guys.</i>

998
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:03,312
<i>They want to analyze my blood</i>

999
00:58:03,314 --> 00:58:05,113
<i>so they can recreate</i>
<i>the formula.</i>

1000
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,915
- Can they really do that?
- <i>I don't know,</i>

1001
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:09,318
<i>but they're prepared</i>
<i>to find out the hard way.</i>

1002
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,520
Well, I've had enough of this.
Come on!

1003
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:22,764
Figures.
They cut the phone line.

1004
00:58:22,766 --> 00:58:24,633
<i>Phone repairmen?</i>

1005
00:58:24,635 --> 00:58:27,202
<i>They're the ones that aren't</i>
<i>smart enough to be cable guys!</i>

1006
00:58:29,305 --> 00:58:32,508
Dad keeps a second cell phone
in his bedroom for emergencies.

1007
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,276
I'll call the cops.

1008
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:37,145
<i>First, let's split up and lock</i>
<i>all the windows and doors.</i>

1009
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:39,448
You know, Abner,
you're invisible.

1010
00:58:39,450 --> 00:58:42,251
You could just slip
right past them and get help,

1011
00:58:42,253 --> 00:58:44,353
and no one would blame you
for running away.

1012
00:58:44,355 --> 00:58:46,855
<i>Run away and leave you alone?</i>

1013
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:50,626
<i>Ain't happening, pal.</i>
<i>This home is my castle, too.</i>

1014
00:58:50,628 --> 00:58:52,094
I can hold them off.

1015
00:58:52,096 --> 00:58:54,096
<i>Chad, what kind of family dog</i>
<i>would I be</i>

1016
00:58:54,098 --> 00:58:56,465
<i>if I ran out at</i>
<i>the first sign of trouble?</i>

1017
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:59,668
The dog always runs off for help
in the old TV shows.

1018
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:02,704
<i>Yeah, well, that's because</i>
<i>those dogs can't talk.</i>

1019
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:06,742
<i>It's not like little Timmy's</i>
<i>fallen in the well or anything.</i>

1020
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:10,112
All right. I'll take the
upstairs and get Dad's phone.

1021
00:59:10,114 --> 00:59:12,114
<i>I'll try to lock</i>
<i>the windows downstairs.</i>

1022
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:15,517
- <i>But you know what, Chad?</i>
- What?

1023
00:59:15,519 --> 00:59:19,221
<i>A dog would give everything</i>
<i>he had for a pair of thumbs.</i>

1024
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:32,234
All right, let's use this gizmo

1025
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,503
so the kid can't call for help.

1026
00:59:34,505 --> 00:59:37,306
I remember!
We jam the cell phones. Yeah!

1027
00:59:37,308 --> 00:59:39,207
Hey, how does it work again?

1028
00:59:39,209 --> 00:59:42,144
- Microwaves.
- Microwaves.

1029
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:47,049
It says here, "Properly ground
yourself before usage."

1030
00:59:47,051 --> 00:59:49,418
Remember the boss
saying anything about that?

1031
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:53,255
Yeah, he said we... And then...
Yeah, I don't remember.

1032
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,591
- Ah, whatever. Let's go.
- Let's do it.

1033
00:59:57,327 --> 01:00:00,262
Okay, first I'll call the cops,
and then I'll call my dad.

1034
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,030
<i>Tell 'em to bring</i>
<i>a female K-9 unit.</i>

1035
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:04,032
<i>Something cute</i>
<i>and not too German.</i>

1036
01:00:04,034 --> 01:00:05,534
I'll ask.

1037
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:11,139
All right,
let's give this thing a go.

1038
01:00:12,875 --> 01:00:14,643
- Yike!
- Murdoch!

1039
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,582
<i>Something wrong?</i>

1040
01:00:21,884 --> 01:00:24,086
It says no signal.

1041
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:27,289
That thing about the grounding?

1042
01:00:27,291 --> 01:00:28,390
Yeah?

1043
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:31,159
I don't think
we did that part right.

1044
01:01:00,056 --> 01:01:02,958
Nice place
you got up here, Ted.

1045
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,327
So close to the beach.

1046
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:07,462
How can you afford it
on what you make?

1047
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:11,466
This is your place, Aunt Ida.
We don't live here with you.

1048
01:01:11,468 --> 01:01:15,337
Oh, no, dear,
you can't stay here with me.

1049
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:18,273
No. It's about time you
stood on your own two feet.

1050
01:01:18,275 --> 01:01:22,544
Besides, I don't have the room.

1051
01:01:22,546 --> 01:01:25,681
Ooh. Seems I've seen
that car before.

1052
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,282
Hmm.

1053
01:01:27,284 --> 01:01:29,418
Maybe we're being followed.

1054
01:01:30,753 --> 01:01:33,955
Well, we'll see you
in a couple weeks, Aunt Ida.

1055
01:01:33,957 --> 01:01:36,191
Well, I'll have to check
my schedule.

1056
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:38,527
They keep me very busy here,
you know.

1057
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:44,733
Oh, hello, handsome.

1058
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:46,768
Beach party tonight?

1059
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,870
Clothing optional?

1060
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:51,206
It's time for your massage.

1061
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:03,485
Did you call Chad,
see how he's doing?

1062
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:06,455
I called him from the rest stop.
Couldn't get through, though.

1063
01:02:06,457 --> 01:02:09,424
You did remember to charge
the battery on the phone?

1064
01:02:09,426 --> 01:02:12,294
I think so.
Oh, relax, honey.

1065
01:02:12,296 --> 01:02:14,429
Chad's just fine.

1066
01:02:14,431 --> 01:02:18,533
He's probably working
on some science experiment.

1067
01:02:18,535 --> 01:02:21,269
He's having the time
of his life.

1068
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:23,505
That's what I'm afraid of.

1069
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:24,873
Come on, Abner.

1070
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,075
<i>Right behind you, Chad.</i>

1071
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,915
<i>We gotta keep those creeps</i>
<i>from getting in here.</i>

1072
01:02:33,917 --> 01:02:36,585
<i>From now on, this room is</i>
<i>our command center.</i>

1073
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:37,686
Check.

1074
01:02:37,688 --> 01:02:39,521
<i>I will be</i>
<i>the commanding officer,</i>

1075
01:02:39,523 --> 01:02:41,590
<i>and you will be</i>
<i>my loyal foot soldier.</i>

1076
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,458
Why do you get to be
the commander?

1077
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,494
<i>Because I'm older than you.</i>

1078
01:02:45,496 --> 01:02:47,562
You're only three years old.

1079
01:02:47,564 --> 01:02:50,599
<i>That's 21 in dog years.</i>
<i>Do the math, kid.</i>

1080
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:52,801
All right.
So what's the battle plan?

1081
01:02:52,803 --> 01:02:54,469
<i>Better living</i>
<i>through chemistry.</i>

1082
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:58,673
<i>Better for us.</i>
<i>For them, well, not so much.</i>

1083
01:02:58,675 --> 01:03:01,009
Well, chemistry really
wasn't my best subject.

1084
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:03,411
Can't we just hit 'em
with a garbage can?

1085
01:03:08,252 --> 01:03:09,885
Hey, somebody's barbecuing.

1086
01:03:09,887 --> 01:03:11,853
Yeah, it's us.

1087
01:03:13,156 --> 01:03:14,823
All right, let's go.

1088
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,500
"Burnt to a Cinder" hot sauce
and chili peppers?

1089
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:29,204
Are we trying to disable them
or are we trying to kill them?

1090
01:03:29,206 --> 01:03:30,839
<i>Both!</i>

1091
01:03:31,908 --> 01:03:33,475
Okay, then.

1092
01:04:08,278 --> 01:04:12,314
<i>Cat! Did that sound like a cat?</i>
<i>Sounded like a cat out there.</i>

1093
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:16,017
Meow!

1094
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:19,988
Easy, Abner. There'll be
plenty of time for cats later.

1095
01:04:22,593 --> 01:04:24,926
Cat! That's right, go ahead!

1096
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:26,962
Taunt me, thing of evil!

1097
01:04:30,267 --> 01:04:34,236
<i>Deep breaths!</i>
<i>Be cool, baby. Be cool.</i>

1098
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:04,799
Welcome to Toy Wonder Shack,
where all your dreams come true.

1099
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,167
How can I help you?

1100
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:07,836
Mind if we have a look around?

1101
01:05:07,838 --> 01:05:09,437
It's a toy store.

1102
01:05:09,439 --> 01:05:11,973
People are supposed
to look around.

1103
01:05:11,975 --> 01:05:13,341
Thanks.

1104
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:23,752
Anything unusual happen
last night? Anything at all?

1105
01:05:23,754 --> 01:05:26,454
Look, sister,
I may be a 30-year-old man

1106
01:05:26,456 --> 01:05:28,590
stuck behind the register
in a toy store,

1107
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:32,227
but in my mind,
I'm on a beach in Cabo.

1108
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:33,595
You know what I mean?

1109
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,077
Hey, Jackie, we got something.

1110
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:53,048
Between the hours of 4:00
and 6:00 last night,

1111
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:55,350
what did you sell?

1112
01:05:55,352 --> 01:05:58,720
Let me check yesterday's
card transactions.

1113
01:05:58,722 --> 01:05:59,955
Yeah, please.

1114
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,660
There you go.
One sale.

1115
01:06:05,662 --> 01:06:08,129
Somebody bought
a kid's chemistry set.

1116
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:12,133
We can check that card number.
Give me two minutes.

1117
01:06:12,135 --> 01:06:13,134
Yeah, great.
Get on it.

1118
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,703
You know what?

1119
01:06:14,705 --> 01:06:16,171
I remember now.

1120
01:06:16,173 --> 01:06:18,406
Two guys wanted
the same chemistry set,

1121
01:06:18,408 --> 01:06:22,477
and they, like,
started fighting over it.

1122
01:06:22,479 --> 01:06:25,747
Two grown men
fighting over a toy?

1123
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,017
Happens all the time.

1124
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:42,831
- Keep a lookout.
- I am! Don't...

1125
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:48,169
You mind?

1126
01:06:52,042 --> 01:06:53,641
Ow! Ah!

1127
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:54,709
God...

1128
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:07,689
Go.

1129
01:07:08,824 --> 01:07:10,091
D'oh!

1130
01:07:11,427 --> 01:07:13,895
We're gonna use
the element of surprise.

1131
01:07:13,897 --> 01:07:14,896
Okay.

1132
01:07:16,065 --> 01:07:18,666
You go that way.

1133
01:07:18,668 --> 01:07:19,901
Yes.

1134
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:25,106
- <i>Hello, boys.</i>
- What was that?

1135
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:28,376
<i>That is the element</i>
<i>of surprise.</i>

1136
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:30,612
A lot of good
that's gonna do you.

1137
01:07:30,614 --> 01:07:35,350
'Cause we got the M-17...
this thing!

1138
01:07:35,352 --> 01:07:38,787
And it jams your cell phones,
so you can't call for help.

1139
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:40,755
You hear that,
you invisible mutt, huh?

1140
01:07:40,757 --> 01:07:43,091
You might as well
just give yourself up

1141
01:07:43,093 --> 01:07:44,159
and come along quietly.

1142
01:07:44,161 --> 01:07:45,493
Yeah.

1143
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:47,862
<i>Oh, I don't do anything</i>
<i>quietly.</i>

1144
01:07:49,131 --> 01:07:51,032
<i>I'll give you a message.</i>

1145
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:54,169
- <i>Cop that.</i>
- Hey!

1146
01:07:55,639 --> 01:07:57,238
<i>Hah! I'll give you a leg up!</i>

1147
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,841
<i>- Eh? How'd you like that?</i>

1148
01:07:59,843 --> 01:08:01,376
<i>Spinning!</i>

1149
01:08:01,378 --> 01:08:04,145
<i>What's the matter?</i>
<i>Can't pull your own weight?</i>

1150
01:08:05,982 --> 01:08:07,849
Stop!

1151
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:09,150
Murdoch!

1152
01:08:09,152 --> 01:08:10,585
Oww!

1153
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:17,826
<i>I'm not done with you,</i>
<i>either, yet, hairy face!</i>

1154
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:20,395
He's got me!

1155
01:08:20,397 --> 01:08:23,431
Grab him! Grab him!

1156
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,168
<i>Oh, no, you don't.</i>

1157
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:30,205
- Where'd it go?
- <i>Miss me? Ha ha ha!</i>

1158
01:08:31,574 --> 01:08:34,042
Maybe you two should consider
a career shift.

1159
01:08:34,044 --> 01:08:37,178
You know, something that
suits your talents more,

1160
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:41,349
like an entry-level position
at Banquet in a Burrito.

1161
01:08:41,351 --> 01:08:42,817
Hey, look, it's the kid.

1162
01:08:42,819 --> 01:08:46,154
I can see it's the kid.
I have eyes.

1163
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:49,157
Hey, kid.

1164
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:52,527
We don't want to hurt you.
We just want the dog.

1165
01:08:52,529 --> 01:08:55,563
Yeah. Just give him to us,
and we'll leave!

1166
01:08:55,565 --> 01:08:59,534
How about I give you these
instead?

1167
01:08:59,536 --> 01:09:03,705
You wouldn't want to do that,
would you?

1168
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:08,643
I mean, you're...
We're all in the same room.

1169
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:10,278
That would just be dumb.

1170
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:11,746
Well, I'm a kid, and...

1171
01:09:11,748 --> 01:09:14,482
I'm kinda supposed
to do dumb things.

1172
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:24,993
Aah! Smells awful!

1173
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:27,795
It's like a 20 megaton fart!

1174
01:09:27,797 --> 01:09:29,130
Isn't it awesome?

1175
01:09:29,132 --> 01:09:30,398
Ow, my eyes are burning!

1176
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,699
I know!

1177
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:34,402
Aah! I can't see anything!

1178
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:36,070
- Come on, Abner, run!
- Running!

1179
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:39,641
Where is the dog?

1180
01:09:40,709 --> 01:09:42,877
Oh, I got him!
I got the dog!

1181
01:09:42,879 --> 01:09:45,246
That's me, you idiot!

1182
01:09:49,051 --> 01:09:52,120
Now I really wanna
hurt that kid.

1183
01:09:53,155 --> 01:09:55,990
You go this way.
I'll go that way.

1184
01:09:55,992 --> 01:09:57,258
Right.

1185
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,280
Ugh. Eww.

1186
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,520
Hello!

1187
01:10:25,522 --> 01:10:27,455
Chad?

1188
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:29,724
Anybody home?

1189
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,868
Now, ain't this just perfection?

1190
01:10:40,870 --> 01:10:42,870
I don't want to make you mad
or anything, Murdoch,

1191
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:44,405
but that ain't the dog.

1192
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,873
I know, you idiot.

1193
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:47,942
It ain't even a little boy.

1194
01:10:47,944 --> 01:10:49,510
Would you... Shh!

1195
01:10:49,512 --> 01:10:51,446
Would you just shut up?

1196
01:10:51,448 --> 01:10:52,580
Hey, kid!

1197
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:54,582
Come on out!

1198
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:56,384
Shh!

1199
01:10:56,386 --> 01:10:59,053
I got your girlfriend!

1200
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,057
We finally got a break.

1201
01:11:03,059 --> 01:11:05,693
Yeah. For once I don't mind
facing the director.

1202
01:11:05,695 --> 01:11:07,929
Did you tell him
I'm doing a bang-up job?

1203
01:11:07,931 --> 01:11:09,230
I did.

1204
01:11:09,232 --> 01:11:11,899
- So what'd he say?
- Oh, you know how he is.

1205
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:14,802
He's not exactly effusive
with his praise.

1206
01:11:14,804 --> 01:11:17,405
But he's pleased with
my performance, right?

1207
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:19,107
Uh...

1208
01:11:19,109 --> 01:11:23,411
Charlie, he said that you are
the most awesome security chief

1209
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:26,781
he's ever known in all of his
years in government service.

1210
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:29,651
Wow. He really said that?

1211
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:31,319
Scout's honor.

1212
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:34,956
I'll go... I'll go get the car.

1213
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:41,162
Excuse me, sir.

1214
01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:54,042
Director.

1215
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:55,843
- Anything?
- Good news, sir.

1216
01:11:55,845 --> 01:11:58,579
We traced one of the suspects
to this toy store.

1217
01:11:58,581 --> 01:12:00,181
You're sure about that, Jackie?

1218
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:03,184
We cannot afford to act on
any sort of wild speculation.

1219
01:12:03,186 --> 01:12:04,719
No doubt about it, sir.

1220
01:12:04,721 --> 01:12:08,256
That's very promising,
but we're running out of time.

1221
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:10,525
Culprits may even be
out of the country by now.

1222
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:13,795
No, sir, I don't think so.
You see, the store clerk,

1223
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:16,864
he remembers two men fighting
over a kid's chemistry set.

1224
01:12:16,866 --> 01:12:19,600
Now, it is possible
that our suspect

1225
01:12:19,602 --> 01:12:22,403
hid the vials inside the
chemistry set,

1226
01:12:22,405 --> 01:12:24,439
intending to come back
and get them later,

1227
01:12:24,441 --> 01:12:26,441
but a customer beats him to it

1228
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:29,977
and unwittingly goes home
with the two formulas.

1229
01:12:29,979 --> 01:12:31,913
That's a lot conjecture,
don't you think?

1230
01:12:31,915 --> 01:12:34,048
It's all we've got.

1231
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:38,019
But I have an address.
We're headed over there now.

1232
01:12:38,021 --> 01:12:40,755
All right, text me the address.
I'll meet you there.

1233
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:42,290
You got it.

1234
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:44,425
And, Jackie?

1235
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:45,426
Yes, sir.

1236
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,996
I hope you're not
wasting my time.

1237
01:12:57,406 --> 01:12:58,973
Do you see the dog?

1238
01:12:58,975 --> 01:13:02,176
He's invisible!
We're looking for the kid!

1239
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,915
Who are you guys?
Where's Chad?

1240
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:10,752
That's what we're about
to find out, sweetheart.

1241
01:13:10,754 --> 01:13:12,453
You're gonna help us
lure that kid out

1242
01:13:12,455 --> 01:13:14,856
and find his rotten dog.

1243
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:17,525
Abner? What does he
have to do with this?

1244
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:18,559
Everything.

1245
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:20,561
Would you shut up?

1246
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:22,096
You, too.

1247
01:13:22,098 --> 01:13:23,297
Hey, kid!

1248
01:13:23,299 --> 01:13:25,299
We got your little
sweetheart here!

1249
01:13:25,301 --> 01:13:29,070
Why don't you come out before
your girlfriend gets hurt?

1250
01:13:29,072 --> 01:13:30,905
Actually, we're just
good friends.

1251
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:34,175
Oh, you better hope
he's sweet on you.

1252
01:13:34,177 --> 01:13:36,277
Excuse me,

1253
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:38,913
but have you guys ever done
this kind of thing before?

1254
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:41,482
- Yeah. One time I stole gum...
- Would you shut up?

1255
01:13:51,393 --> 01:13:55,263
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em, kid.

1256
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:57,465
No more stink bombs.
No funny business.

1257
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,637
Sophie, I'm sorry you got
mixed up in all this.

1258
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:04,872
That's okay, Chad.

1259
01:14:04,874 --> 01:14:07,909
What is "this" anyway?

1260
01:14:07,911 --> 01:14:09,911
Well, it's a long story.

1261
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:12,980
Hey, you guys can
chitchat later.

1262
01:14:12,982 --> 01:14:14,849
We got some business
to attend to.

1263
01:14:14,851 --> 01:14:17,318
You got something we want,

1264
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,654
and we got something you want.

1265
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:23,024
So you wanna exchange Abner
for Sophie, is that right?

1266
01:14:23,026 --> 01:14:24,692
It's that simple.

1267
01:14:24,694 --> 01:14:28,796
Uh, where is Abner,
and why do these guys want him?

1268
01:14:28,798 --> 01:14:30,431
<i>I'm right here, sweet potato.</i>

1269
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:33,434
<i>And these two morons want me</i>
<i>because I'm invisible.</i>

1270
01:14:33,436 --> 01:14:36,838
Chad, your dog's invisible?
Cool!

1271
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:40,575
<i>You're darn right it's cool.</i>
<i>Too cool for these fools.</i>

1272
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:42,810
And he can talk, too.

1273
01:14:42,812 --> 01:14:46,080
This is all very, very weird.

1274
01:14:46,082 --> 01:14:48,783
- I know.
- But totally awesome!

1275
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:50,184
Yeah, yeah.

1276
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:51,452
Excuse me.

1277
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:54,589
Do you you two lovebirds
wanna talk about anything else?

1278
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:56,390
- Nope.
- Then shut up!

1279
01:14:56,392 --> 01:14:58,392
All right, let's get
down to business.

1280
01:14:58,394 --> 01:15:00,661
- Kane.
- Yes?

1281
01:15:00,663 --> 01:15:02,697
- Go grab the mutt.
- Okay.

1282
01:15:02,699 --> 01:15:05,199
No funny business, kid.
Ya got me?

1283
01:15:05,201 --> 01:15:07,401
Now, when Kane grabs the mutt,

1284
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:10,505
then you'll get
your little cutie back.

1285
01:15:13,308 --> 01:15:15,042
Go over there!

1286
01:15:19,481 --> 01:15:21,315
Whoa. What's that?

1287
01:15:21,317 --> 01:15:24,785
Homemade pepper spray.
Chili peppers and hot sauce.

1288
01:15:24,787 --> 01:15:26,487
Oh.

1289
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:29,190
Oh, it's very effective!

1290
01:15:29,192 --> 01:15:31,425
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1291
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:35,463
- I can't see!
- Come on!

1292
01:15:35,465 --> 01:15:36,464
Oww!

1293
01:15:39,568 --> 01:15:41,202
Get 'em!

1294
01:15:41,204 --> 01:15:42,637
I'm goin'! I'm goin'!

1295
01:15:44,273 --> 01:15:45,673
Oww!

1296
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,612
Would you...
get off of me?

1297
01:15:51,614 --> 01:15:53,047
Stupid!

1298
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,585
All right. You go that way,
I'll go this way.

1299
01:15:57,587 --> 01:15:59,353
I said that way!

1300
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:19,273
Front door's open.
We better be careful.

1301
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:21,709
What are those?

1302
01:16:21,711 --> 01:16:23,544
Infrared heat sensing.

1303
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:25,880
It shows how many people
are in the house.

1304
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:27,415
Sweet.

1305
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,820
Okay, Chad, so what's the plan?

1306
01:16:32,822 --> 01:16:35,222
Sorry, Sophie.
There is no plan.

1307
01:16:35,224 --> 01:16:38,659
This is our last stand.

1308
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,996
That's right.
Your last stand!

1309
01:16:41,998 --> 01:16:45,566
Just like you're the Alamo,
and we're the Indians!

1310
01:16:45,568 --> 01:16:47,935
There were no Indians
at the Alamo.

1311
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:49,604
Oh, yeah? Who says?

1312
01:16:49,606 --> 01:16:51,706
- I do.
- Oh.

1313
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,542
Abner, where are you?

1314
01:16:54,544 --> 01:16:56,677
<i>I'm over here.</i>

1315
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:59,046
And so am I.

1316
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:01,616
There's at least four.

1317
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:03,384
It looks like trouble.

1318
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:05,286
<i>Hah!</i>

1319
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,654
<i>You're all thumbs, mate!</i>

1320
01:17:16,231 --> 01:17:18,966
<i>Right in the como se llama!</i>

1321
01:17:18,968 --> 01:17:20,835
<i>Didn't see that coming,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

1322
01:17:20,837 --> 01:17:25,172
<i>Oh, yeah! I love spare ribs.</i>
<i>Yum yum yum yum yum.</i>

1323
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:28,676
Meow.

1324
01:17:28,678 --> 01:17:31,078
Hey, where'd that cat
come from?

1325
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,648
Cat? Did someone say cat?

1326
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:35,416
Uh-oh.

1327
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,153
- I got him!
- <i>Let me go!</i>

1328
01:17:39,155 --> 01:17:40,855
- I got him!
- Abner!

1329
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:42,423
Give me that!

1330
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:44,959
All right, let's go.

1331
01:18:06,915 --> 01:18:09,216
Sir, we may have
a hostage situation.

1332
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:11,519
Looks like our suspects
are already inside.

1333
01:18:12,587 --> 01:18:14,789
We can't take any chances,
Jackie.

1334
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:17,658
If the suspects are in there,
we need to take them out.

1335
01:18:17,660 --> 01:18:20,661
- Really take them out.
- Yes, sir.

1336
01:18:20,663 --> 01:18:24,565
We need to recover those
secret formulas at any costs.

1337
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,806
What do you got there, Charlie?

1338
01:18:31,808 --> 01:18:34,075
There's enough tranquilizer
in these darts

1339
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:36,644
to knock out a bull elephant.

1340
01:18:36,646 --> 01:18:38,479
That's what I'm talking about.

1341
01:18:38,481 --> 01:18:40,047
Come on. We'll go around
the side of the house,

1342
01:18:40,049 --> 01:18:41,682
maybe catch them off guard.

1343
01:18:41,684 --> 01:18:42,817
Okay.

1344
01:18:45,587 --> 01:18:47,088
Good luck.

1345
01:18:54,363 --> 01:18:56,597
Don't even think
about biting me.

1346
01:18:57,599 --> 01:18:59,734
Hey. You got ahold
of that mutt?

1347
01:18:59,736 --> 01:19:02,436
Yeah, but it's like
wrestling a sack of weasels.

1348
01:19:02,438 --> 01:19:05,639
I gotta say, it's been
a pleasure meeting you kids.

1349
01:19:05,641 --> 01:19:08,509
If you tell anybody
we were here...

1350
01:19:09,444 --> 01:19:11,645
- Ah, let's go.
- All right!

1351
01:19:16,785 --> 01:19:18,619
Oh, hey, look who it is.

1352
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:19,920
Oh!

1353
01:19:19,922 --> 01:19:22,490
This works great.

1354
01:19:37,139 --> 01:19:38,372
Peep.

1355
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:41,709
Great shooting, agents.

1356
01:19:47,249 --> 01:19:49,483
How you doin'?

1357
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:52,119
I'm with
the U.S. Government.

1358
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:55,356
Congratulations.
You two are heroes.

1359
01:19:55,358 --> 01:19:58,993
These men stole two
top secret government formulas,

1360
01:19:58,995 --> 01:20:01,061
and somehow they wound up here.

1361
01:20:01,063 --> 01:20:03,731
You're darned right, they did,
and Abner drank them.

1362
01:20:03,733 --> 01:20:04,999
Who's Abner?

1363
01:20:05,001 --> 01:20:06,767
Abner is Chad's dog.

1364
01:20:06,769 --> 01:20:11,172
<i>And by the way, one of those</i>
<i>formulas tasted like dog poo.</i>

1365
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:15,009
A talking invisible dog.

1366
01:20:15,011 --> 01:20:16,644
Makes perfect sense.

1367
01:20:16,646 --> 01:20:18,279
It does?

1368
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:24,118
Now, look, I know you guys have
been through a really tough day,

1369
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,887
but I'm sure you want to help
your government, right?

1370
01:20:26,889 --> 01:20:28,455
Good.

1371
01:20:28,457 --> 01:20:31,826
Our scientists must now
recreate the stolen formulas,

1372
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,861
and in order to do that,

1373
01:20:33,863 --> 01:20:38,065
we must bring Abner in
for a few very simple tests.

1374
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:39,233
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

1375
01:20:39,235 --> 01:20:41,769
Does he really have to go?

1376
01:20:41,771 --> 01:20:44,772
We should probably cooperate
with the government, Chad.

1377
01:20:44,774 --> 01:20:47,041
After all,
they are the good guys.

1378
01:20:47,043 --> 01:20:50,744
Thank you for understanding.
It'll be just for a few days,

1379
01:20:50,746 --> 01:20:53,881
and then we'll have him
back to you safe and sound...

1380
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:56,217
and visible.

1381
01:20:56,219 --> 01:20:58,252
How great will that be?

1382
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:01,789
Okay, Abner, come on, boy.

1383
01:21:01,791 --> 01:21:04,124
<i>Oh, all right.</i>

1384
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:05,159
Come on.

1385
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:07,161
<i>Hey! Watch the foot, pal!</i>

1386
01:21:07,163 --> 01:21:09,063
Jackie, Charlie,

1387
01:21:09,065 --> 01:21:10,931
stay here and secure
those prisoners.

1388
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:12,867
Are you sure, sir?
But what about security?

1389
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,802
One of us should stay with you
at all times.

1390
01:21:14,804 --> 01:21:16,437
Don't worry,
I'm perfectly capable

1391
01:21:16,439 --> 01:21:19,840
of transferring Abner
to the lab myself.

1392
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:22,476
Hey, what's this?

1393
01:21:22,478 --> 01:21:27,514
This is the M38-R
signal jamming device.

1394
01:21:27,516 --> 01:21:31,285
Only one prototype of this
exists.

1395
01:21:31,287 --> 01:21:34,688
And the only one
who had access to it, sir.

1396
01:21:34,690 --> 01:21:39,026
Charlie, once again
you're mistaken.

1397
01:21:39,028 --> 01:21:40,461
It's the M38-R, all right.

1398
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:43,464
Hey, that's
the phone-jamming device!

1399
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:45,432
They used it to block
our emergency call.

1400
01:21:45,434 --> 01:21:47,001
<i>Yeah, they told me</i>
<i>all about it.</i>

1401
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:49,436
<i>They were pretty cocky</i>
<i>about the whole thing, too!</i>

1402
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:51,438
How did they get it?

1403
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,241
Stay back, Jackie.
You, too, Charlie.

1404
01:21:54,243 --> 01:21:58,212
I'm leaving here with the dog,
and no one's going to stop me.

1405
01:21:58,214 --> 01:22:00,281
<i>Hah! Famous last words.</i>

1406
01:22:00,283 --> 01:22:02,983
Aah! Aah!

1407
01:22:05,855 --> 01:22:07,755
He bit my butt!

1408
01:22:09,325 --> 01:22:12,660
Stay back. Stay back!
I'm not kidding!

1409
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,429
Stay back.

1410
01:22:18,366 --> 01:22:20,501
<i>Allow me.</i>

1411
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:32,613
<i>Hey, hotshot,</i>
<i>what's your hurry?</i>

1412
01:22:33,415 --> 01:22:35,582
Ohh! Aah!

1413
01:22:37,019 --> 01:22:38,986
Take him, please!

1414
01:22:41,389 --> 01:22:42,489
Good work, Abner!

1415
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:44,325
Yeah, get 'em, boy!

1416
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,029
This explains a lot,

1417
01:22:49,031 --> 01:22:52,032
how the bad guy was able
to sneak into the lab

1418
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:53,867
disguised as Old Man Jenkins,

1419
01:22:53,869 --> 01:22:56,837
and how he knew what to
look for, where to look.

1420
01:22:56,839 --> 01:22:58,839
You set this all up,
didn't you, sir?

1421
01:22:58,841 --> 01:23:01,608
You even threw your own men
under the bus.

1422
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:04,011
No, they were just
a couple of bumbling idiots.

1423
01:23:04,013 --> 01:23:05,646
I had a serious timeline.

1424
01:23:05,648 --> 01:23:07,481
I had the buyers lined up
for the formulas.

1425
01:23:07,483 --> 01:23:11,285
Now, please, someone
just get this dog off me!

1426
01:23:12,288 --> 01:23:13,587
<i>Not until you say Uncle!</i>

1427
01:23:13,589 --> 01:23:16,190
Double-crossed
by our own boss.

1428
01:23:16,192 --> 01:23:18,826
Of all the lowdown, dirty...

1429
01:23:18,828 --> 01:23:21,362
<i>Did you say dirty?</i>
<i>Let me clean him up for you.</i>

1430
01:23:21,364 --> 01:23:23,831
Aah! Gross!

1431
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:28,002
Aah! Stop licking me!
Stop! Please!

1432
01:23:29,472 --> 01:23:32,606
Aah! Get him off!
Get him off!

1433
01:23:32,608 --> 01:23:33,774
Come on!

1434
01:23:33,776 --> 01:23:35,142
Good boy!

1435
01:23:35,144 --> 01:23:36,310
Aah!

1436
01:23:36,312 --> 01:23:38,345
Uncle! Uncle!

1437
01:23:50,925 --> 01:23:52,793
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

1438
01:23:52,795 --> 01:23:54,361
Hey!

1439
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,231
Well, how's your day been?

1440
01:23:57,233 --> 01:24:01,368
Great. I finished my school
project, and it was a doozy.

1441
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,569
What's with him?

1442
01:24:02,571 --> 01:24:04,438
I had a little bit
of spare time,

1443
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,807
and I decided
to give him a bath.

1444
01:24:06,809 --> 01:24:08,442
Oh. Good.

1445
01:24:08,444 --> 01:24:10,878
Probably needed it.

1446
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,080
Whew!
I'm sure he needed it.

1447
01:24:13,082 --> 01:24:16,150
Smells like a stink bomb
went off in here.

1448
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:20,120
Something wrong?

1449
01:24:34,102 --> 01:24:35,736
So tell me again.

1450
01:24:35,738 --> 01:24:37,704
Why didn't you have to go
with the government guys

1451
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:39,373
to get the lab tests?

1452
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:42,576
<i>Jackie may not be a crook</i>
<i>like her ex-boss, Mr. Denning,</i>

1453
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:44,011
<i>but she's a whole lot smarter.</i>

1454
01:24:44,013 --> 01:24:46,113
- How so?
- <i>All she really needed to do</i>

1455
01:24:46,115 --> 01:24:48,549
<i>was to take some of my slobber</i>
<i>off Denning's face</i>

1456
01:24:48,551 --> 01:24:50,150
<i>and run the tests on that.</i>

1457
01:24:50,152 --> 01:24:52,419
<i>Fortunately there was</i>
<i>plenty of it to work with.</i>

1458
01:24:52,421 --> 01:24:54,054
Well, you gave him a washing.

1459
01:24:54,056 --> 01:24:56,790
<i>He had it coming,</i>
<i>but it's gonna be a lot harder</i>

1460
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:59,393
<i>to get your mom and dad</i>
<i>used to having me around now.</i>

1461
01:24:59,395 --> 01:25:00,561
Give 'em time.

1462
01:25:02,965 --> 01:25:07,334
<i>I know that bark.</i>
<i>It's my beautiful Afghan cutie.</i>

1463
01:25:07,336 --> 01:25:10,871
<i>Wait up, baby!</i>
<i>Here I come!</i>

1464
01:25:12,173 --> 01:25:13,440
Oh, no.

1465
01:25:16,077 --> 01:25:17,878
Here comes trouble.
Stay close to me

1466
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:19,847
and don't let 'em
know you're here.

1467
01:25:19,849 --> 01:25:23,617
Hey, Chad.
Going to school, I see.

1468
01:25:24,686 --> 01:25:26,720
You don't want to be late,
do ya?

1469
01:25:26,722 --> 01:25:28,622
I'm not afraid of you guys.

1470
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,925
Oh, look at the little brainiac.
A tough guy.

1471
01:25:31,927 --> 01:25:34,394
Gotta be careful what you say,
brainiac.

1472
01:25:34,396 --> 01:25:37,731
Yeah. Real careful.

1473
01:25:38,533 --> 01:25:40,067
Ohh!

1474
01:25:41,369 --> 01:25:42,603
Aah!

1475
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:54,481
That's right.
Go home to your mamas!

1476
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,852
Wow! I saw
the whole thing, Chad!

1477
01:25:58,854 --> 01:26:01,889
You just beat the snot
out of those two boys.

1478
01:26:01,891 --> 01:26:05,159
Yeah, well, they started it,
and I was just like...

1479
01:26:05,161 --> 01:26:07,094
That was totally awesome!

1480
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:11,298
Now they won't try to stop me
from hanging out with you.

1481
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,766
Is Abner around?

1482
01:26:13,868 --> 01:26:16,803
Well, yeah...
I mean, I thought he was.

1483
01:26:16,805 --> 01:26:17,604
Abner?

1484
01:26:17,606 --> 01:26:18,805
<i>Right here, pal.</i>

1485
01:26:18,807 --> 01:26:19,940
Wait. Where were you?

1486
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,775
You missed the whole thing.

1487
01:26:21,777 --> 01:26:24,077
<i>Sorry, buddy. I had a little</i>
<i>business to attend to.</i>

1488
01:26:24,079 --> 01:26:27,114
- What kind of business?
<i>- Love business.</i>

1489
01:26:27,116 --> 01:26:29,650
<i>I made a hot date with that</i>
<i>little Afghan down the street.</i>

1490
01:26:29,652 --> 01:26:30,984
Good for you!

1491
01:26:30,986 --> 01:26:32,686
<i>Shouldn't you two kids</i>
<i>get going?</i>

1492
01:26:32,688 --> 01:26:34,221
<i>You don't want to be late</i>
<i>for school.</i>

1493
01:26:34,223 --> 01:26:37,858
He's right, Chad.
Can I walk with you to school?

1494
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:41,028
Uh, yeah, sure,
I mean, if you want to.

1495
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:42,029
I do.

1496
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,298
<i>Have fun, you two.</i>

1497
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:46,099
See you around.

1498
01:26:46,101 --> 01:26:48,202
Maybe you will.

1499
01:26:48,204 --> 01:26:50,070
And maybe you won't.

1500
01:27:05,620 --> 01:27:07,154
Gesundheit.

1501
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:21,720
