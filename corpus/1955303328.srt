1
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,238
Come on!
This is heavy!

2
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,560
Come on.
We have no time now.

3
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,791
Everything must be set right...

4
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,951
or the master will be unhappy.

5
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:39,356
Let's go. Come on.

6
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,116
Madam, since I've been
serving you for 24 years...

7
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:03,637
may I ask you,
why must you do this?

8
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,558
Please.

9
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,030
At least not on your birthday.

10
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,398
I'm 40 years old.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,832
It is time to do something.

12
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,755
Otherwise,
I'll feel sorry for myself.

13
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,678
You're not gonna tell me something's
wrong with the banquet, are you?

14
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,991
This is so tight,
I could hardly breathe.

15
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,549
Madam, everything's fine
with the banquet.

16
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,835
Good.

17
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,474
I had a strange dream last night.

18
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,997
I dreamed that my lord
had taken a second wife.

19
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,198
- He was so happy.
- You know how it is.

20
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,273
A man is happier
the more wives he has.

21
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,637
Are you suggesting
that I should consider...

22
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,790
May not be such a bad idea.

23
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,792
- I will do it then.
- Madam!

24
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,190
Madam Kang is dying!
Her blood is everywhere!

25
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,594
Come quick!

26
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,672
Mother, may I?

27
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,433
Go, go, go.

28
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,196
Don't disturb me.
I'm busy.

29
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,512
Madam Kang is dying.
Her baby refuses to be born.

30
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,240
No, you will not go.

31
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:33,234
Ailian, it is your
40th birthday party.

32
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,519
Lord, madam is worried
that it might damage...

33
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,876
our young lord's marriage
to the Kangs' daughter...

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,997
if she does not
go over to help.

35
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,033
It will be a while
before the guests arrive.

36
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,034
I will personally make sure
that she is not late for the banquet.

37
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,240
Be late...

38
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,880
and you will no longer
belong to the Wu family!

39
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,473
Hey! Come back here!
Stop right now!

40
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,153
Communist, come back!

41
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,919
Be careful, madam.

42
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,432
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,155
Sorry. No men are allowed.
Someone is in labour right now.

44
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,236
Thank God you've come, madam.

45
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,994
Meichen.

46
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,479
It's Ailian.

47
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,279
Can you hear me?

48
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,079
Sorry, Ailian.

49
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,030
Forgive me for not telling you.

50
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,077
Too embarrassed.

51
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,992
It's all right.

52
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,437
It's good fortune
to have a baby, even after 40.

53
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,476
No, please!

54
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,394
- You can't go in!
- Don't let him come in!

55
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,994
He can't go in there.

56
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,356
Father, I beg you.
Mother's dying.

57
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,750
The foreign doctor has come.

58
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,194
Where's the hot water?

59
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,114
Mr Kang, I've studied medicine.
I can help.

60
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,520
Leave me alone.

61
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,116
Doesn't he know that it's forbidden
for men to see such things?

62
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,753
What if I can save her life?

63
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,150
Madam Kang will lose all face.

64
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,914
She would rather die than have
any man but her husband see her there.

65
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,276
What good is face if she dies?

66
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,555
Pray for her.

67
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,599
I must talk to you before I die.

68
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,071
Please, take care of Lin Yi for me.

69
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,916
- Is she still conscious?
- Yes.

70
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,480
Andre, no!

71
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,713
I'm sorry.

72
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,116
Get out! Get out!

73
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,560
Get me a pan of hot water
and some fresh towels.

74
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,439
Now!

75
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,957
Has your mother returned yet?

76
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,236
Where is she?

77
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,515
Lord.

78
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,917
Old Lady was wondering
why we couldn't start yet.

79
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,037
She's losing patience.

80
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,112
You tell her we're almost ready.

81
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,192
What are we going to do?

82
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,749
Women. Never trust a woman!

83
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,479
- I heard you shouted at Madam Wu.
- Did I?

84
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,029
You know their family.
They own half this town.

85
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,477
You know that I needed her help,
and she did help.

86
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,236
I've worked too hard here
to let you make trouble for me.

87
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,073
Father! Father!

88
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,750
My master wants
to give this to you.

89
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,838
I appreciate your master's kindness,
but I cannot accept this.

90
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,673
Please give it back to him.

91
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,519
How dare you
make all of us wait for you!

92
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,478
Madam Kang will live...

93
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,200
and there is a foreign man,
a priest.

94
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,590
Go apologize
to my mother and guests.

95
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,115
We talk after dinner.

96
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:59,671
Let her be, my son.
Come sit by me, my daughter-in-law.

97
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,753
Let us begin.

98
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,074
Enjoy your meal.

99
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:24,079
If I were him, I'd spend money
on a concubine, not a banquet.

100
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,070
The Japanese have virtually
taken over Manchuria.

101
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,836
Maybe they will be satisfied,
then leave us in peace.

102
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,435
They will never
make it that far south.

103
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,751
Fengmo, here comes
your future bride.

104
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,639
Welcome, Mr Kang.
Please, follow me.

105
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,599
I can't wait
for your wedding banquet.

106
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,200
Daughter-in-law, what kind of a girl
are you going to find for my son?

107
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,634
I haven't thought about that yet.

108
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,792
Tell me, why do you want
another woman for your husband?

109
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,360
I think it is time
for me to retire from my duties.

110
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,033
What do you mean?

111
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,317
I somehow felt...

112
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:10,154
my husband deserves
a younger wife.

113
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,560
She's crazy.

114
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,479
My mother tried to kill herself
when my second mother came.

115
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,519
And my second mother took poison
when my third mother came.

116
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,035
She arranged it all for him.

117
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,430
- I can't believe it.
- Congratulations!

118
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,556
Thank you.

119
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,917
You have such a wonderful wife
to arrange a concubine for you.

120
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,391
That's really something.
Let's toast your first concubine.

121
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,357
What?

122
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,953
- What are you talking about?
- Stop pretending to be shy.

123
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,111
We just heard your wife say...

124
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,157
you deserve a younger girl.

125
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,754
- But...
- Second wife.

126
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,877
You must invite me
to the wedding banquet.

127
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,193
Come on! <i>Gan bei.</i>

128
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,880
- Let me get some more wine.
- Just call a servant.

129
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,997
No. It's my pleasure.

130
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,272
They said you are
giving me a concubine.

131
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,350
Why didn't you tell me?

132
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,038
Don't you like the idea?

133
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,597
Is there anything else, madam?

134
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,990
No. You can leave now.

135
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,714
Good night.

136
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,234
Ying?

137
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:41,791
You can call me in the night
if you need anything else.

138
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,913
Will you be jealous of her?

139
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,710
I'm 40 years old today.
I'm no longer young.

140
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,949
I like your hair's fragrance.

141
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,951
You had too much to drink today.

142
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,592
Who is she?

143
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,240
And how old is she?

144
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,232
Is she pretty? Look.

145
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,912
I want someone just like you.

146
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:10,358
It will be all right.
Trust me.

147
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,397
She will serve you better than I.

148
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,198
Will you still take care of me...

149
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,112
when the new one comes?

150
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,439
Since that day I marry you...

151
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,115
twenty-four years ago...

152
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:36,199
it has been my duty to serve you
and make you happy.

153
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,999
I thought...

154
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,754
I would hold you like this
until I died.

155
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,598
Father of my sons?

156
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,311
Father of my sons?

157
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,239
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

158
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,429
I think it might be better
to put you into younger hands.

159
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,238
Tomorrow. Do it.

160
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,152
I want to go to sleep.

161
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,354
Can we talk just a minute?

162
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,034
No.

163
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,198
Do it now.

164
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,434
Please.

165
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,354
Do it!

166
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,912
Aren't you coming to bed?

167
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,993
No.

168
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,632
I have a bed ready.

169
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,238
Hurry up. Hurry up!

170
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,510
Hey, you, stop!

171
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,592
- Time to eat.
- My God!

172
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:07,197
- It's very funny.
- What time is it tonight?

173
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,509
10:00.

174
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,034
My father is going to kill me
if he finds out I'm doing it again.

175
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,952
Then don't get caught.

176
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,920
Wait.

177
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,917
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

178
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,599
- The matchmaker brought me here.
- Matchmaker?

179
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,596
Oh, no! One is broken.

180
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,955
Thank heaven you're here!

181
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,599
I was terrified!

182
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,273
Stupid, stupid girl.

183
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,478
I told you to follow me.
Why don't you listen?

184
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,674
This girl is so perfect
for your family.

185
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,071
Her mother left her,
and her foster mother raised her...

186
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,550
in order to get a dowry.

187
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,672
If not for the war,
she wouldn't give her up so quickly.

188
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,231
If you could be so kind...

189
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,234
to add another, say,
50 pieces...

190
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,030
Fine. I need to speak
with her alone.

191
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,954
Of course, madam.
I'll leave her to you.

192
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,039
Go. Go!

193
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,032
What is that in your hands?
I told them to bring nothing.

194
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,996
I brought you some fresh eggs,
15 of them.

195
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,072
Not one is older than seven days.

196
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,830
Come closer.
I would like to see them.

197
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,196
But one got broken on the way.

198
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,195
Her feet are so big,
like a monkey's.

199
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,590
She's a country girl.

200
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,752
Must have gone barefoot
since birth. I think...

201
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,590
I hope you like them.

202
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,194
I had nothing else.

203
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,910
Do you think
you would like to stay here?

204
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,196
The matchmaker
told my foster mother...

205
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,079
that I will not starve here.

206
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,836
She told me to please you
above all else.

207
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,196
That necklace is very beautiful.

208
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,994
It's the only thing I have
from my real mother.

209
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,833
What is your name?

210
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,151
I have no real name.

211
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,234
My foster mother called me
Little Orphan when I was small...

212
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,358
and Big Orphan when I got big.

213
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,597
I can give you a name
if you wish.

214
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,280
Chiuming.

215
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,639
It means "bright autumn."

216
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,358
You will bring the brightness
to my lord's autumn.

217
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,154
Yes. I like it.
Don't you?

218
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,116
Mother, do you think a young girl
would suit a family like ours?

219
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,830
It's very generous of your wife
to arrange it for you.

220
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,914
More grandchildren will make
the Wu family even greater.

221
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,390
There is a law
forbidding concubines now.

222
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,995
- These matters are not for children.
- Grandmother.

223
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,595
I'm not a child.
I'm 18 years old.

224
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,320
The Kang family
has requested that...

225
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,359
Fengmo will receive
some foreign education...

226
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,352
before he marries the daughter.

227
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,312
Ask the priest from the orphanage
that you met at the Kangs'.

228
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,959
He can teach Fengmo.

229
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,515
- I do not want to be married!
- Fengmo.

230
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,718
The priest can come in,
but not his god.

231
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,954
Madam Wu has requested
that I come for an interview.

232
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,031
He's here. The foreigner.

233
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,998
The same man you met
at Madam Kang's.

234
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,231
And he said
you sent for him.

235
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,039
Send him in.

236
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,476
Don't stand there
with your mouth open like a fish.

237
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:11,590
It's a pleasure to see you again, lady.
Please forgive my rudeness.

238
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,475
Please sit down.

239
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,393
I should thank you
for saving my best friend's life.

240
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,676
We did it together, didn't we?

241
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,592
How would you prefer
I address you?

242
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,070
I forgot to ask
your name last time.

243
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,550
May I borrow your brush?

244
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,758
You can call me Andre.

245
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,275
You can write in Chinese?

246
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,635
Yes.

247
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,633
- How long have you been here?
- Three years.

248
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,279
Have some tea.

249
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,998
What country are you from?

250
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,835
I was born in America,
but China is my home now.

251
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,592
What made you come to China?

252
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,109
My church asked
for volunteers, and...

253
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,834
well, here I am.

254
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:15,636
I have heard
you have an orphanage.

255
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:20,435
Why would a foreign man like you...

256
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,113
like orphanage work?

257
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,793
It's a job for women.

258
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,320
Why should such a pleasurable and
important job be done by women only?

259
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,239
Do you miss your family?

260
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,312
I don't have a family.

261
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,510
Your parents didn't
arrange a wife for you?

262
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,796
No. I'm not married.

263
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,152
Is it because of your religion?

264
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,994
Yes. I'm a priest.

265
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,231
Sister Shirley tells me you're looking
for a tutor for your youngest son.

266
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,512
Yes. How much are your fees?

267
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,751
I don't require any fees.

268
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,035
Thank you for your kindness, but...

269
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,794
it would put the Wu family
in a lower position...

270
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,600
if you didn't accept the fees,
wouldn't it?

271
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,637
No, not at all.

272
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:22,394
We all have the same position
in the eyes of God.

273
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:26,280
Then we should give
the money to your god.

274
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,757
I'd rather not take money, but...

275
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,480
I will accept
some clothing and food...

276
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,472
for the children
of the orphanage.

277
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,679
That can be arranged.

278
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,717
Thank you, madam.

279
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,554
Classes will begin
the week after the wedding.

280
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,556
I hope you understand,
our Old Lady...

281
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,873
does not want you to talk
about your religion in your class.

282
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,110
Grandma!

283
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,271
- Is he your grandson?
- Yes.

284
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,080
I have three sons
and two grandchildren.

285
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,472
I'm sorry. Ying?

286
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,756
- Where's Ying?
- It's all right.

287
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,194
I like kids.

288
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,913
Come, come.

289
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,310
Come here.
I don't bite.

290
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:23,074
What is this?
A lion? A dog?

291
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,152
Get out of the way!

292
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,792
Young Lord,
this is your teacher.

293
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,839
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Congratulations on your wedding.

294
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,792
It's my father's wedding.

295
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,434
I'm sorry.

296
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:59,160
Madam Wu
invited me to this wedding.

297
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,391
- I would never think...
- Congratulations, Mr Wu.

298
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,596
You see, in America,
men have only one wife.

299
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,275
You're not in America now.

300
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,714
Forgive me.

301
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,715
What do you think
about getting a second mother?

302
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,513
I think it's disgusting.

303
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,796
My father has young wives.

304
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,634
But I'm the daughter
of the first wife.

305
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,710
Great.

306
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,998
Foolish thing!

307
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,958
What is there to fear?

308
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,991
Just lie back...

309
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,754
and it be over soon!

310
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,753
Consider how lucky you are.

311
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,519
Do you have a home to run to?

312
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,429
Or a mother to give you rice?

313
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,476
Just obey your duty...

314
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,280
and you can grow fat
and comfortable...

315
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,919
like me!

316
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,956
Your hands...

317
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,872
are like a washboard!

318
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,792
Please forgive me, lord.

319
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,119
You are hurting me!

320
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,072
What's wrong with you?

321
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,840
Stupid girl.

322
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,560
Take off your clothes.

323
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,159
Come...

324
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,594
over...

325
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,034
here.

326
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,434
Lord, I beg you, please don't!

327
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,638
Open your mouth.

328
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,440
Lord, please, I beg you!

329
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,672
- Good morning, lady.
- From now on...

330
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:22,640
you must call me Elder Sister,
not lady.

331
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,439
Yes, lad...

332
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,079
Elder Sister.

333
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,040
You are a member
of the Wu family now.

334
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,919
Sweeping the floor
is the servants' job...

335
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,435
not yours, child.

336
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,477
Yes, Elder Sister.

337
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,155
I hope you understand...

338
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,519
I put the entire happiness
of our lord in your hands.

339
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,078
Fengmo, what do you want?

340
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:00,235
I've just come to see you, Mother.
How are you feeling?

341
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,711
I'm quite well. Why don't you say
good morning to your second mother?

342
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,430
Good morning, Second Mother.

343
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,117
You should know the family rules.

344
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,510
Send a servant to let me know
before you come.

345
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,599
She's so young,
and Father is so old.

346
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,353
Send her home.

347
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,835
This is not something
for you to decide.

348
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,116
Mother, this is wrong.

349
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,271
Andre says that
even in Western countries...

350
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,829
everyone is supposed to have
a monogamous relationship.

351
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:41,196
Well, how does a foreigner
know about Chinese?

352
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,391
Fengmo, police! Move!

353
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,709
Let's go!

354
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,393
Stop!

355
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,589
It was my father-in-law's library.

356
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,359
My husband had it closed
after he died.

357
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,396
I've read most of the books here.

358
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,112
<i>Dream of the Red Chamber.</i>

359
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,632
You don't know
how many times I've read this.

360
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,236
Do you think a woman is capable
of learning as much as a man...

361
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,960
or is her mind inferior?

362
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,360
Inferior?

363
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,559
No, but they certainly
are different.

364
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,399
Do you think a woman is happier...

365
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,040
if she reads less?

366
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,634
I don't know.

367
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,111
But I do know that a book doesn't know
whether a man or woman is reading it.

368
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,757
If this is satisfactory,
I'll have them clean it for you.

369
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,592
It's perfect.

370
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,591
Madam?

371
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,554
Young Lord is in jail.

372
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,756
Why?

373
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,639
They said he is involved
with Communist activity.

374
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,830
Nonsense! I have to go get him.

375
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,152
Madam, you are a woman.
You can't.

376
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,074
But how can I tell the lord?

377
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:53,797
We're expected at
Madam Chiang Kai-shek's reception...

378
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,078
for the American ambassador
to Nanking.

379
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,310
Here's the invitation.

380
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,196
He is suspected
of being a Communist.

381
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,398
Without an order from
the Shanghai police bureau...

382
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,914
I can't release him.

383
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,560
Are you suggesting that I tell
Madam Chiang...

384
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,712
that you would prefer
to keep her guest in jail?

385
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,837
May I have your name, please?

386
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,040
Is that really a letter
from Madam Chiang?

387
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,557
Yes, it is, thanking me
for opening up the orphanage.

388
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,472
How did you know
he couldn't read English?

389
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,119
I took a chance.

390
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,675
The lamp is the sun.

391
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,833
The Earth.

392
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,994
The moon.

393
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,595
So, the Earth moves...

394
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,672
Around the sun.

395
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,270
And the moon moves
around the sun. Yes or no?

396
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,714
Yes and no.

397
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,354
Excellent.

398
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,354
My grandmother is the sun.

399
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,875
My father is the Earth.

400
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,031
My mother is the moon.

401
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:09,192
And I cannot escape their gravity.

402
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,560
Interesting.

403
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,756
My parents don't care
if the Japanese are right next door.

404
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,400
And our government is more interested
in making money from the war...

405
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,631
than in fighting them.

406
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,916
So what are you saying?

407
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,235
This concubine thing
makes me sick.

408
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,755
She's just a girl my age.

409
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,040
This place stinks
like a mouldy tomb.

410
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,878
They want me to be like them.

411
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,917
I must get out of here.

412
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,151
Then why don't you go?

413
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,116
Saying and doing...
two different things.

414
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,354
Let's get back to astronomy.

415
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,231
It's important to keep studying,
no matter what happens.

416
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:01,471
Fengmo, you're a very lucky
young man.

417
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,232
A total lunar eclipse...

418
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,880
occurs once every 18 years
in the same place...

419
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:10,555
and we can see one tonight.

420
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,871
When the Earth blocks the sun's light
from reaching the moon...

421
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,397
the moon seems to disappear
in the Earth's shadow.

422
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,440
Here.

423
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,555
My mother likes to look
at the stars too.

424
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,554
It's beautiful.

425
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,160
Mother.

426
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,596
Andre's brought a telescope.
We've been looking at the moon.

427
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,479
Both hands.

428
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,232
- I can't see anything.
- No, try again.

429
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,559
Is that better?

430
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,554
Mother, why don't you
come to class?

431
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,360
Chiuming can come with you
if you think it doesn't look right.

432
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,511
She can study too.

433
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,796
That way you won't be
the only woman.

434
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,514
I'd be honoured
if you joined us, lady.

435
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,518
I do not know how to keep
from getting pregnant...

436
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,035
when I sleep with the father
of my sons.

437
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,152
Another baby will surely kill me...

438
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,312
but how do I compete
with my husband's younger wives?

439
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,359
Fengmo's tutor told him
American men...

440
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,875
can only have one wife.

441
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:20,600
It is so pitiful you had to find
a concubine for your husband.

442
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,760
The girl...

443
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,718
where did you find her?

444
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,632
You like her?

445
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,871
Does he like her?

446
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,634
I like her.
She's an ordinary girl...

447
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,996
but a good one.

448
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,912
You sound like you hired a maid.

449
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:41,351
Meichen, I feel like a frog...

450
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,033
living in a well...

451
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:45,794
only seeing the small portion
of the sky.

452
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,277
I have wanted to visit you
many times, Ailian...

453
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,079
to discuss our children's wedding.

454
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:57,030
But since that foreigner is there, it
would be too shameful for me to meet...

455
00:41:57,120 --> 00:42:00,033
He saved your life, Meichen.

456
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,954
Besides, he's just a priest.

457
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:07,152
Fengmo even suggested
that Second Lady and I...

458
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,960
should join the class with him.

459
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:14,280
You seem so changed, Ailian.

460
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,113
You got one!

461
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,671
- I caught a duck!
- There he is!

462
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,190
Madam, I believe this is yours.

463
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,391
Thank you.

464
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,952
Please, go away.

465
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,716
Go away.

466
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,836
Good-bye, ladies.

467
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,311
It's all right.
He's gone.

468
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:07,760
He scared me to death.
Did you see his hairy chest?

469
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:10,435
No wonder they say
that foreigners are half animal.

470
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,396
My little precious!

471
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,037
My poor little baby.

472
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,713
Are you all right?

473
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:49,910
Lady! Lady! I must speak to you
about the foreigner.

474
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,515
He must have starved to death
in his past life.

475
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,479
It's because of your generosity
he takes all the leftovers...

476
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,552
you usually give to the servants.

477
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,236
Mother, the day after tomorrow
is Andre's birthday.

478
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,119
- We must have a banquet for him.
- A banquet?

479
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,795
Young Lord, he's not family.

480
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,759
I don't think Old Lady
and your father will agree.

481
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,797
I have an idea.

482
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,349
Foreigners like a huge cake...

483
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,319
with a candle in the middle
for their birthday.

484
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,030
All right.
We can make one for him.

485
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:22,759
But how big?

486
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,315
Big enough.

487
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,710
I saw these yesterday.

488
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,110
I thought you might like them.

489
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:06,840
Come see. Take it. Take it.

490
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,037
I like the way you massage me.

491
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,953
Take a seat.

492
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,597
I've been worried about Fengmo.

493
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,036
Perhaps you should attend
a few classes...

494
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,954
and make sure everything's
all right with him.

495
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,998
You must be joking.
I would fall asleep.

496
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,952
Why don't you go?

497
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:36,520
Perhaps...

498
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:38,751
if Chiuming came with me.

499
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,517
I will tell my mother.

500
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,240
I can't relax with her!

501
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,677
She doesn't know how
to comfort me. You could.

502
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,753
No, you must not think
of me that way.

503
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:54,275
It is unfair to Chiuming.

504
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,714
Unfair?

505
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,516
You are so naive.

506
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,796
She's just a puppet.

507
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:05,112
How could you buy a puppet
with a heart?

508
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:10,360
She cannot compare with you.

509
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:14,150
I only do this because you made me.

510
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:17,472
Do it, now.

511
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,233
Now.

512
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,436
Ying!

513
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,637
Madam, I'm here.

514
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:26,439
I'm too old.

515
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,518
I can't take care of you forever.

516
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,874
Any questions?

517
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:51,400
I have a question.

518
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,880
I hope you don't mind.

519
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:54,835
Not at all.

520
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,359
Have you ever seen your god?

521
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:02,792
I thought we were prohibited
from discussing religion.

522
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:08,153
This is not religion.
Why don't you tell us?

523
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,435
No, I have never seen Him.

524
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,080
How can you believe
in what you can't see?

525
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,718
Faith.

526
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:23,678
He's in everything.

527
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:27,237
In bread. In water.

528
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,835
In sleeping. In waking.

529
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,669
In feeding the lost children.

530
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:39,476
Teaching Fengmo and Chiuming,
and talking to you now.

531
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,920
Faith.

532
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:52,794
<i>Is it selfish if any individual
puts his happiness...</i>

533
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:55,236
<i>before the happiness of his family?</i>

534
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,950
<i>But if a person is unhappy,
how can he serve his family?</i>

535
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:02,999
<i>A question.</i>

536
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:05,549
<i>Are all Chinese marriages arranged?</i>

537
00:48:05,640 --> 00:48:07,518
<i>Marriage has to be arranged.</i>

538
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:11,314
<i>- Why?
- Marriage is a family matter.</i>

539
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,360
<i>And family is the most important
obligation here.</i>

540
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,911
<i>Our sorrows and joys
belong to the family.</i>

541
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,794
<i>What happens when we die?</i>

542
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,440
<i>That's always a very good question.</i>

543
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:28,512
<i>When we die...</i>

544
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,512
<i>our soul will be free.</i>

545
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,957
<i>Then I can't wait
for my soul to be free.</i>

546
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,038
<i>I always wonder...</i>

547
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,760
<i>why Western people
like to go to church...</i>

548
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,753
<i>to confess how guilty they are.</i>

549
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,039
<i>Well, I always wonder why Chinese
people like to pray for more money...</i>

550
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:51,476
<i>sons and beautiful wives.</i>

551
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,639
<i>Are people in your country...</i>

552
00:48:55,720 --> 00:49:00,078
<i>allowed to do things that
are forbidden by society?</i>

553
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,396
<i>In theory, everyone's equal...</i>

554
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,159
<i>and has the right to pursue
whatever makes them happy.</i>

555
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:12,119
<i>I don't think
I have that kind of right.</i>

556
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:17,712
I've got something to show you.

557
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:21,077
I brought a photo of my sister
and my mother...

558
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,880
so you can see
how Western women dress.

559
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,273
That's my mother and sister.

560
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,677
They're so beautiful.
You must miss them very much.

561
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,479
Is that you?

562
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:35,313
You were so cute.

563
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,232
- Big and hairy now.
- Like a bear.

564
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,879
Who is laughing so loudly?

565
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:49,794
Your son and your wives, lord.

566
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,237
They are having classes.

567
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,476
Here's the birthday steam cake.

568
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:09,552
Be careful. It's hot.

569
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,757
Long life, teacher.

570
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,590
How did you know
it was my birthday?

571
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,831
- We made a cake for you.
- Eat it while it's hot.

572
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,757
I put a lot of sugar, sweet beans
and dried fruits in there.

573
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,559
I had to steam it for two hours.

574
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,519
The candle kept falling down.

575
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,193
It's all right now.

576
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:30,431
But be careful.

577
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,876
Hey!

578
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,555
Why did you blow out the candle?
I worked so hard.

579
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:38,869
I made a wish.

580
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,153
Doesn't it smell delicious?

581
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,799
You first.

582
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,357
You don't like it?

583
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,318
No. I like it very much.

584
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,914
We just want you to feel
you're at home.

585
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,439
Fire!

586
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:19,676
The orphanage is on fire!

587
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,834
God!

588
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,680
Stay there.

589
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,474
It's too late!

590
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,154
Give me some water.
Give me some water!

591
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,832
- Are you all right?
- Elder Sister!

592
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:24,196
Breathe. Are you all right?

593
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,839
Where are they taking them?

594
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,755
Our lady has ordered
to move the children...

595
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,672
to the Wu compound.

596
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,719
Let it go.

597
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:01,232
You gained two kilos.

598
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,118
But it's all in your ears.

599
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:07,114
It's mine! It's mine!
You can't get me.

600
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,873
Children.

601
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,914
What have you done?
He's dead.

602
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,640
- You killed him.
- He's dead.

603
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:20,274
You killed him!

604
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,275
Here's something sweet.

605
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:41,398
I hope the children
enjoy their watermelon.

606
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,394
Madam, thank you.
We appreciate it very much.

607
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:47,312
Never mind.

608
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,276
Thank you.

609
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,072
You're alive.

610
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,836
That's all that matters.

611
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:24,233
You know, I think
Second Wife is distracted.

612
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:26,710
Her heart is somewhere else.

613
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:31,033
Once she has a baby,
she will be part of the Wu family...

614
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:33,794
and her heart will be settled.

615
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:36,634
Madam, would you send me away
if I said something...

616
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,791
that might make you angry?

617
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,679
Have I ever sent you away yet?

618
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,196
Go on.

619
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:47,751
I think you should not have risked
your life saving that foreigner.

620
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,674
- People are talking.
- About what?

621
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,993
Unmentionable things.

622
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:57,393
If I hadn't gone into
that burning orphanage...

623
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:58,960
Andre...

624
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:03,239
I mean, that foreigner
and his children would be dead.

625
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:07,553
I think we should not let Old Lady
find out about what happened.

626
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,394
Very strange.
Those foreigners...

627
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:15,872
they like to hold your hands
to show their appreciation.

628
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,472
Makes me embarrassed.

629
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,200
Madam, if I were you...

630
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:32,399
I would not let that foreigner
touch one hair on my body.

631
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,154
You even let him stay
on our compound.

632
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,677
And the servants, they do not like
serving people from the orphanage.

633
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,832
You should see lord's face.
He's not happy with this either.

634
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,639
What else?

635
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,070
I think you should arrange
for Fengmo's marriage...

636
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:59,275
and make the orphans go away
from this house as soon as possible.

637
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,278
I thought I had lost it.

638
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:33,712
I knew it was yours.

639
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,959
The clasp was broken, so...

640
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:41,269
I fixed it.

641
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,554
Thank you.

642
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:59,878
Why don't you put it on
so you don't lose it again?

643
00:59:03,240 --> 00:59:05,072
Let me help you.

644
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:16,120
It's the only thing
you have from your mother...

645
00:59:16,200 --> 00:59:17,714
isn't it?

646
00:59:32,480 --> 00:59:34,517
Electricity. It sounds good.

647
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,637
But it's a waste of money.

648
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,871
Hey, bring me some tea.

649
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,435
Wu, how 'bout your new wife?

650
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,512
Don't be so shy.

651
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:47,671
You're part of the club now.

652
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,594
We all have several wives.
Isn't that so?

653
00:59:55,080 --> 00:59:57,549
I'm so used to the first wife.

654
00:59:57,640 --> 01:00:00,838
Second Wife, she doesn't
know how to take care of me.

655
01:00:03,160 --> 01:00:05,231
I have an idea.

656
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,472
Come with us
to the flower boat.

657
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,349
There you can really relax, huh?

658
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,758
- No, my mother would never allow me.
- Your mother?

659
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:21,959
Come on!

660
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,874
In the dark there's no difference...

661
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,429
between a concubine
and a flower girl.

662
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:29,874
That's right.

663
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,476
No, no, no, I can't.
I can't.

664
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,997
Leave him alone.
Go home to your wives.

665
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:39,436
We'll go there without you.

666
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:41,034
Let's go.

667
01:00:55,680 --> 01:00:59,799
Is my son gonna be absent
from the table tonight again?

668
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:08,396
Chiuming, where has your husband
been the last few nights?

669
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,792
Ancient, he's been going out
with Mr Kang.

670
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,037
Daughter-in-law...

671
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:27,113
I hope you haven't been so busy
attending classes...

672
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,431
and taking care of the orphans...

673
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,831
that you have neglected
your duty to the others.

674
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:35,239
Yes.

675
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,279
Let's eat.

676
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:50,999
There's my father. Look.

677
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,470
Fengmo, there's your father too.

678
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:05,680
- Hey, don't let him get away.
- I can't.

679
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:13,554
- So shameful.
- Grab him. Bring him back here.

680
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,031
Awful. I really wish I wasn't
from this family.

681
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:23,360
Madam! Madam!

682
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:26,672
Old Lady says she's not going.
She's afraid of this electricity.

683
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,592
Lord says he cannot go either.

684
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,240
Should I still put the basket
in the boat?

685
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:35,636
No, we cannot go without them.

686
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:37,552
Mother, everyone is going.

687
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,758
The Wu family will lose face if your
mother appears without your father...

688
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,399
at the celebration.

689
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:44,472
- Maybe I shouldn't go.
- No.

690
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,071
We are going.

691
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:00,994
Just wait till Old Lady
finds out about this.

692
01:03:03,960 --> 01:03:05,314
Electricity!

693
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,751
And so...

694
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:57,277
we bring our humble town...

695
01:03:57,360 --> 01:03:59,716
into the modern age.

696
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:03,400
Electricity.

697
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:15,951
Electricity.

698
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:26,794
Why?

699
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,279
Can you tell me why?

700
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:34,916
Could you translate?
I don't understand the dialect.

701
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:36,514
All right.

702
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:41,749
This is a story about a girl...

703
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:46,836
who had to disguise herself
as a boy...

704
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,276
in order to go to school.

705
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,713
In the three years,
we shared the same window.

706
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,713
- My feelings for you...
- I can understand.

707
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:08,200
My feelings for you grew
as deep as the sea.

708
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,559
In pairs birds fly.

709
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,109
Lovers' shadows...

710
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:22,795
forever entwined.

711
01:06:24,680 --> 01:06:27,240
Your smile makes my heart break.

712
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:32,197
But you know my father
has already arranged my marriage.

713
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:49,796
A thousand words in my heart.

714
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:52,873
Still, to express my feelings...

715
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,953
I know not where to start.

716
01:06:58,560 --> 01:06:59,437
What?

717
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:02,839
Nothing.

718
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,359
I miss you.

719
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,315
I cannot sleep at night.

720
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,439
I miss you.

721
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,400
- They flew away together.
- I eat but do not taste.

722
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:31,276
I miss you.

723
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:36,838
I pick up the brush
but cannot write.

724
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:39,760
I miss you.

725
01:07:42,280 --> 01:07:45,671
Without you my life is a waste.

726
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,034
I miss you.

727
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,479
They were separated...

728
01:08:11,560 --> 01:08:14,792
and died from love sickness...

729
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,639
and were buried together.

730
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,717
A pair of butterflies...

731
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:29,793
emerged from their grave...

732
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,076
and flew away together.

733
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,998
If I cannot be with you
in this life...

734
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:50,754
Then I will be with you
in the next.

735
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,199
You know the story?

736
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:00,835
All love stories end the same,
don't they?

737
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:13,035
This is a Western butterfly story.

738
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:18,030
It's one of my favourite operas.

739
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,394
Just listen.

740
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:40,159
Why do all love stories
end in tragedy?

741
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,153
Someday you will understand.

742
01:10:48,240 --> 01:10:50,630
No, Mother, I want to know.

743
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,070
Is love a sin?

744
01:10:55,400 --> 01:10:58,313
Love is never sinful.

745
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:01,632
It's the most beautiful feeling
we can have.

746
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:14,280
I'm sorry. I think we're forbidden
to talk about this topic.

747
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,159
- What if love is forbidden?
- Fengmo, stop it.

748
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,314
Teacher, Mr Wu would like
to speak to you.

749
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:27,509
Let's stop now.

750
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,796
I hope you understand.

751
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:59,430
It is not appropriate
to talk about relationships...

752
01:11:59,520 --> 01:12:03,275
between a man and a woman
in my house.

753
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,552
What's wrong?

754
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:18,317
Father, some boys threw stones
and mud at us.

755
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,279
They said we are bananas...

756
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:25,195
yellow on the outside,
white on the inside.

757
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:28,193
They say you like that rich Wu lady.

758
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,751
It's all right.
Let's wash up.

759
01:12:37,840 --> 01:12:39,672
It's all right.

760
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:47,873
I have been concerned
about the rumours.

761
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,475
It's not only your face.

762
01:12:50,560 --> 01:12:53,029
It affects all of our reputations.

763
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,472
"Create in me a clean heart,
O God."

764
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:08,353
Now that you have enough
foreign education...

765
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:12,275
you will marry the Kangs' daughter
on the moon festival.

766
01:13:12,360 --> 01:13:14,875
- I do not love her.
- Love?

767
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,353
Nonsense.

768
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,558
Your marriage was decided
before the two of you were born.

769
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:25,759
If you force me, I will join
the Communist army.

770
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,036
Then you are not my son.

771
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,911
You must be careful
of the foreigner.

772
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,710
You do not know who he is
and what he really is up to.

773
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,673
I don't understand
why you trust him so much.

774
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:48,037
Old Lady wants to move that
foreign devil out of the Wu compound.

775
01:13:49,480 --> 01:13:52,917
Lady, I'm so concerned
about you.

776
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,640
It seems you don't
watch out any more.

777
01:13:55,720 --> 01:13:57,871
Are you listening to...

778
01:14:17,640 --> 01:14:19,791
Good evening, Elder Sister.

779
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:21,872
What are you doing here
at this hour?

780
01:14:25,720 --> 01:14:28,110
- Where is Fengmo?
- I haven't seen him.

781
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:32,035
- I just saw you right here with him.
- It's not true!

782
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,351
You think I'm blind?

783
01:14:34,440 --> 01:14:36,955
I hope you understand.
Your job is to serve your husband.

784
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,430
He doesn't like me.

785
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,954
He kicks me out of the bed.

786
01:14:46,040 --> 01:14:48,600
I don't know what to do.

787
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,798
- He goes to the flower boat.
- You lie again.

788
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:55,271
It's true. I swear it!
It's true.

789
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:59,070
It's also true you're Fengmo's second
mother. Who do you think you are?

790
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:02,595
I shouldn't have brought you here.

791
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,798
Daughter-in-law...

792
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,276
is the priest still living
in the servants' quarters?

793
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:22,278
The orphanage
is being repaired, Mother.

794
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:28,672
We give you money to run the family,
not on someone else.

795
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:36,476
Teacher?

796
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:42,518
I have a question.

797
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,831
Can't it wait until class?

798
01:15:47,240 --> 01:15:50,836
If we die,
our soul will be free, right?

799
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:52,673
Yes, that's true.

800
01:15:56,520 --> 01:15:59,957
I heard you saved the foreigner from
the fire and went to the opera with him.

801
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,354
Does the priest teach class
about men and women?

802
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:22,920
Move him out of my house.

803
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,193
<i>Help!Somebody help!</i>

804
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,511
Second Lady has killed herself!

805
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,514
Stay here!

806
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,194
What is he doing?

807
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:07,396
She's conscious.

808
01:17:11,600 --> 01:17:12,795
Let me die!

809
01:17:14,280 --> 01:17:17,717
Stupid girl. She can't even
play dead correctly.

810
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:37,355
She's going to be all right.

811
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:40,829
I have to speak with you.

812
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:44,871
Thank you for saving her.

813
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,709
I can't imagine what would have
happened today without you.

814
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:52,713
- I have one request.
- Anything.

815
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,476
Let her go.

816
01:18:00,200 --> 01:18:01,873
I can't.

817
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,754
- It's beyond my power.
- You brought her here.

818
01:18:05,840 --> 01:18:08,036
You can set her free.

819
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,595
I'm sorry. I can't.

820
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:19,472
How can I face my family?
What would people say?

821
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,234
What would people think if they knew
Fengmo was in love with her?

822
01:18:25,520 --> 01:18:27,477
How did you know that?

823
01:18:27,560 --> 01:18:28,960
She told me.

824
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:32,192
She'd rather die
than live here any longer.

825
01:18:36,040 --> 01:18:38,032
Shameless.

826
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:41,079
Ruin the name of the Wu family.

827
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,720
- She seduced my son.
- Seduced?

828
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,276
You brought her here!

829
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:49,955
If I didn't, she could have
died of hunger.

830
01:18:52,200 --> 01:18:54,351
Why are you so cold?

831
01:18:55,400 --> 01:18:57,357
You sacrificed that young girl...

832
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,830
on the bed of a man
old enough to be her father!

833
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:04,073
Did you really think you could free
yourself by imprisoning another?

834
01:19:10,160 --> 01:19:12,629
Who do you think you are?

835
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:14,439
A saviour?

836
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:20,153
You come to China
to save our Chinese children...

837
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:21,469
to save us?

838
01:19:22,280 --> 01:19:26,433
Why don't you go to your country
to save yourself and your country first?

839
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,431
I thought I knew you.

840
01:19:43,080 --> 01:19:44,594
Good-bye, lady.

841
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:23,791
<i>A long time ago...</i>

842
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:27,999
there was a little frog who lived
at the bottom of an old well.

843
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,679
He thought...

844
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:35,674
the sky was just
this little patch of blue...

845
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:37,513
above his head.

846
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,557
- He had no idea...
- Madam Wu!

847
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:10,151
Where's my son?
Where's my grandson?

848
01:23:10,240 --> 01:23:12,391
Where's my daughter-in-law?

849
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:15,871
Heaven! Are you trying
to break my old bones?

850
01:23:16,240 --> 01:23:17,959
Ying!

851
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:21,638
Where the hell are they?

852
01:23:22,680 --> 01:23:26,310
- I will go look for them.
- Go, go!

853
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:28,997
Why don't you come home
with me?

854
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,959
Two wives not enough
for you, Mr Wu.

855
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:36,798
Come home with me.

856
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,955
She is free now.

857
01:23:43,040 --> 01:23:45,555
You can be free too.

858
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,040
But...

859
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,034
she is young.

860
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:53,238
- Times have changed.
- And you're so old.

861
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,758
The other day...

862
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,674
when you gave me that birthday
dumpling or whatever it was...

863
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,673
that's the first time I celebrated
my birthday since I was a child.

864
01:24:12,720 --> 01:24:15,235
I feel like I belong here now.

865
01:24:23,000 --> 01:24:24,400
Come.

866
01:24:30,560 --> 01:24:32,711
Here. Can you walk?

867
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:39,036
Let me help you.

868
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:53,074
Put me down.

869
01:24:55,600 --> 01:24:58,672
- Let me take a look.
- I'm fine.

870
01:24:58,760 --> 01:25:01,878
Let me see.
I'm a doctor, remember?

871
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,276
- It's all right.
- Let me see.

872
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:07,238
Maybe you sprained it.

873
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:16,113
Does that hurt?

874
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,351
- Yes?
- It's all right.

875
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,438
It's all right.

876
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:45,118
Why are you crying?

877
01:28:39,200 --> 01:28:40,429
<i>Where have you been?</i>

878
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:48,437
On your knees!

879
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:52,480
Beg for forgiveness
from your ancestors.

880
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:55,473
Ancestors, I beg
for your forgiveness.

881
01:28:55,560 --> 01:28:59,190
Apologize for driving
your second wife away!

882
01:28:59,280 --> 01:29:01,511
Forgive me for driving
my second wife away.

883
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,197
Beg for forgiveness
for breaking the family rules!

884
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:09,910
I beg for forgiveness
for breaking family rules.

885
01:29:11,120 --> 01:29:13,555
Beg for forgiveness
for losing face.

886
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:16,838
I beg for forgiveness
for losing face.

887
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:21,555
Beg for forgiveness...

888
01:29:21,640 --> 01:29:23,359
Great Grandma!

889
01:29:59,880 --> 01:30:03,271
It is a blessing that
she did not live to see this war.

890
01:30:03,360 --> 01:30:06,432
I've heard the Japanese have killed
hundreds of people in the north.

891
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:26,878
May I pray for her?

892
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:29,872
Pray then.

893
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,919
My mother can have
one more heaven to go to.

894
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:51,835
Forgive me, Father.

895
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:54,071
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

896
01:31:11,480 --> 01:31:14,279
You are not really leaving,
are you?

897
01:31:22,280 --> 01:31:23,839
I am.

898
01:31:29,400 --> 01:31:31,551
Where are you going?

899
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:35,351
As far away as possible.

900
01:31:36,360 --> 01:31:38,955
Fengmo, I'm sorry.

901
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,477
It's hard for me
to explain to you.

902
01:31:42,560 --> 01:31:44,392
You're my son.

903
01:31:45,840 --> 01:31:49,675
But I think only you
can understand.

904
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,199
Mother...

905
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,158
how could you?

906
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:59,351
How can I understand you...

907
01:32:00,480 --> 01:32:03,393
when you bought a girl
to warm my father's bed?

908
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:05,233
How can I understand you...

909
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:07,755
when you drove Chiuming
to try to kill herself?

910
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:10,309
How can I understand you...

911
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:12,596
when my father visits
the flower boat every night?

912
01:32:12,680 --> 01:32:15,991
How can I understand you
when you betray us with my teacher?

913
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:19,032
Because...

914
01:32:20,640 --> 01:32:22,950
it has taken me 40 years...

915
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:26,078
to feel the way
you feel about Chiuming.

916
01:32:58,840 --> 01:33:00,672
I have come to say good-bye.

917
01:33:01,720 --> 01:33:03,757
I am joining the Communist army.

918
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,912
So you've decided.

919
01:33:10,920 --> 01:33:15,437
You can find Chiuming in the
missionary school near Wuxi church.

920
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:19,879
How's your mother?

921
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:22,873
Changed.

922
01:33:24,360 --> 01:33:25,919
Go see her.

923
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:31,879
Thank you for all you have done.

924
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,636
Take care of my mother.

925
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,514
God bless you.

926
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,757
I've heard...

927
01:33:57,840 --> 01:34:01,356
you sent a message
to tell the foreigner...

928
01:34:01,440 --> 01:34:03,397
to come for my care.

929
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:05,039
Yes.

930
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:09,319
I told the servants
not to give him your message.

931
01:34:10,920 --> 01:34:12,195
Why?

932
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:14,749
I'm not dead yet!

933
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,839
Children! Children, in the house!

934
01:34:26,920 --> 01:34:30,675
Put your things down!
Inside! Inside!

935
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:32,717
In the house, hurry!

936
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:34,359
Quickly, in the house!

937
01:34:37,160 --> 01:34:39,152
Get in, hurry!

938
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:40,913
Under the bed!

939
01:35:11,680 --> 01:35:13,717
Now! There's no more time.

940
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:16,474
Now! Go down!
Get on the boat!

941
01:35:18,200 --> 01:35:20,032
Get on the boat!

942
01:35:26,760 --> 01:35:28,319
I'm not leaving.

943
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,193
You want to die?

944
01:35:31,280 --> 01:35:34,830
- I'm not leaving with you.
- Get on the boat!

945
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,912
You don't understand.

946
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,719
I'm sorry.

947
01:35:43,560 --> 01:35:44,835
Come with me, woman.

948
01:35:47,520 --> 01:35:49,398
Now!

949
01:35:49,480 --> 01:35:51,233
Not this time.

950
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,191
I've served you for 24 years.
Not any more.

951
01:36:02,280 --> 01:36:06,672
- Listen! You belong to me.
- No. I belong to nobody.

952
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:09,559
You're nobody without the Wu family!

953
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,599
Don't leave me alone!
I'm scared!

954
01:36:15,680 --> 01:36:19,310
If you no longer care for me,
think of your sons!

955
01:36:37,480 --> 01:36:41,554
My lord is looking for her!
They had a fight and she disappeared.

956
01:36:41,640 --> 01:36:44,360
Take the children.
I'll meet you at Wuxi church.

957
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,319
It's too dangerous.
The Japanese have taken the town.

958
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:49,869
She must be trapped there!

959
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:02,829
Daughter?
Where are you, daughter?

960
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:21,035
Last night a foreign priest
asked me...

961
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:24,397
if I was still alive
to give this to you.

962
01:43:28,600 --> 01:43:31,593
- He was here?
- He saved our lives.

963
01:43:34,360 --> 01:43:36,556
Tell me. Where is he?

964
01:45:39,880 --> 01:45:44,511
Tell me the names that
Father Andre had given you, children.

965
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,473
Honesty.

966
01:45:48,560 --> 01:45:50,199
Kindness.

967
01:45:50,280 --> 01:45:51,634
Faith.

968
01:45:51,720 --> 01:45:53,234
Truth.

969
01:45:53,320 --> 01:45:55,835
- Humanity.
- Mercy.

970
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,752
- Light.
- Grace.

971
01:45:57,840 --> 01:45:59,638
- Sunbeam.
- Star.

972
01:45:59,720 --> 01:46:01,154
Dawn.

973
01:46:01,240 --> 01:46:02,833
Charity.

974
01:46:02,920 --> 01:46:04,320
Rose.

975
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:22,480
Mother, I don't have a name.

976
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:25,837
Your name will be Love.
