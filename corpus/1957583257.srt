There was a booth at the fair.

OK, so the Clippers are

close is Toledo, right?

Right, they're 14 and 8.

Right. I can't wait
to go to Toledo.

I figured you'd be in here.

You know, there was
a time I thought
I'd have to kick you out

754

so the other players
would get a chance
to use the facilities.

have the discipline.

he went to New York.

is the home of the

the Boston Massacre.
