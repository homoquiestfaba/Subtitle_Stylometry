00:02:01,681 --> 00:02:05,351
- Davis, I need more of them
Specimen sacks in here.

<I>Coroner:
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

10
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,025
<I> Yeah,
that's it.

11
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:19,231
<I> It looks like
pig innards.

12
00:02:19,233 --> 00:02:22,634
I don't think
it's pig.

13
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:26,037
Pacific units,

Where's the car,
Darling?

22
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:48,226
It's still on
the interstate.

23
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:52,863
I just passed
something big.

24
00:02:52,866 --> 00:02:56,767
I, um--
Tanker truck

25
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,270
<I> Pulling
on the ramp.

26
00:02:58,271 --> 00:03:01,505
Now, darling,
we need to know
it's destination.

27
00:03:01,507 --> 00:03:03,607
<I> We've got to know
where he's taking her.

28
00:03:03,609 --> 00:03:05,943
It's not like that.

29
00:03:05,945 --> 00:03:08,312
I can't pick...

30
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,583
What I see
or feel.

<I> He has on
a button-front shirt.

34
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:57,093

There's one girl tied
to the arm rest thing.

37
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:10,240
Tell us about
the car, darling.

38
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,275
The car...

39
00:04:12,277 --> 00:04:15,844
The car is, um...

40
00:04:17,849 --> 00:04:20,683
It's an automatic.

41
00:04:20,684 --> 00:04:22,584
<I> The radio's broken.

42
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:25,955
It's one of those,
Uh...

43
00:04:25,957 --> 00:04:30,292
Big-big cars that
they don't make
anymore.

( Sighs )

46
00:04:36,867 --> 00:04:39,601
He's...

47
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:42,504
<I> He's low on gas.

48
00:04:42,506 --> 00:04:44,273
He's gonna have
to pull over soon.

49
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:47,142
<I> He was gonna want
to pull over soon anyway

50
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:50,479
<I> 'Cause he's feeling
the urge.

51
00:04:50,481 --> 00:04:53,815
( Groans )
That's what
he calls it.

52
00:04:53,817 --> 00:04:55,284
The urge.

53
00:04:55,286 --> 00:05:00,054
<I> The girl is certain
She's gonna die.

54
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:03,358
<I> She's praying.

55
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,428
In her mind
She's praying.

They just passed
a sheriff's car
one lane over.

59
00:05:14,371 --> 00:05:17,872
Pursuit units,
suspect just passed
a county car.

60
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,710

Don't.  Don't.

<I>Woman:
Oh, sweet jesus!

62
00:05:25,681 --> 00:05:28,149

to do to her.

Come on, darling,
what have you got
for us?

66
00:05:44,901 --> 00:05:48,536
<I>Woman:
He's on a long dirt road,

67
00:05:48,538 --> 00:05:51,005
Lined with lots
of trees.

69
00:05:55,312 --> 00:05:57,145

He's untying her.

( Girl cries )

72
00:06:12,362 --> 00:06:16,530
<I> He's taking her inside
some place big.

73
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:18,731
<I> it's a barn
or a shed

74
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:21,134
At the end
of the dirt road.

75
00:06:21,136 --> 00:06:24,338
Oh, sweet god!

76
00:06:24,339 --> 00:06:26,807
Get him.
Get him!

00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:34,680

78
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:55,535
<I>Woman:
Stop him!  Stop him!

79
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,737
Stop him!

80
00:07:01,142 --> 00:07:04,011
I think
They made it.

81
00:07:04,012 --> 00:07:07,946
Officer:
Hold it!
Don't move!

82
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,217
( Sighs )

Freeze,
right there!

84
00:07:15,691 --> 00:07:17,756
( Screams )
Oh, god!

85
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,467
What's happening,
Cayce?

( Sighs )

87
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:38,744
He's--
He's dead.

88

He's dead.
They got him.

89
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,153
And that girl...

90
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:54,659
Is--
She's all right.

<I>Male officer over radio:
We got him!

92

<I> We got the sucker!
He's deader than shit!

93

How's the girl?

94
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:04,335

But otherwise okay.

95

Man #1:
Yeah, hold on
for a second!

98
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:26,557
<I>Man #2:
Put some overheads there.
That'll fix that.

99
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,994
<I>Man #1:
I want to have that.
I've got shadows on there.

100

<I>Makeup woman:
Justin, sweetheart,

101
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,863
<I> Do something
about her hair, will you?

102
00:08:32,865 --> 00:08:35,400
<I>- Okay, let's check.
- Tv broadcast:
Or your money back.

103
00:08:35,402 --> 00:08:37,200
Man #1:
Close in that
barn door a bit.

104
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:39,870
<I> ...incredibly close,
the second one even closer.

105
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:41,805
<I> and this recharger
will never need support

106
00:08:41,808 --> 00:08:45,009
<I> Because the charger stand
keeps its conveniently charged.

107
00:08:45,011 --> 00:08:48,145
<I> I've learned in 30 years
that helped me get ahead.

108
00:08:48,148 --> 00:08:50,180
- Now, I'm really
going for it.
- Oh, thanks.

109
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:53,217
The inside story for anyone
who wants to get ahead.

110
00:08:53,218 --> 00:08:55,286
Ten seconds,
everyone!

111
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,288
...That gives
you the advantage in
business and in life.

<I>- Camera one: ready.
- Producer: cue one.

115
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:11,134
It's 22 minutes
past the hour.
and welcome back.

116
00:09:11,137 --> 00:09:13,336
<I> She initially visited us
four years ago

117
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:15,939
<I> To talk about
her first book,
"Window onto madness."

118
00:09:15,941 --> 00:09:19,042
Her account of while
still a student at
Leland college

119
00:09:19,044 --> 00:09:22,280
In South Carolina
She reached into
the mind

120
00:09:22,281 --> 00:09:24,347
of mass murderer
Leonard Scott Levy

121
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,450
<I> and led police to him
in an isolated barn,

122
00:09:26,452 --> 00:09:29,052
<I> Just moments before
he could claim
his 11th victim.

123
00:09:29,054 --> 00:09:30,719
Her second book,
"Murder driven"

124
00:09:30,721 --> 00:09:32,221
Told of her
year long involvement

125
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:33,522
On the Dolf Millhauser
murder case.

126
00:09:33,525 --> 00:09:36,194
and she's here
with us today
to talk about

127
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:39,196
her new book
"Split reflections."

128
00:09:39,198 --> 00:09:40,964
<I> it's an account
of her harrowing
experience

129
00:09:40,966 --> 00:09:43,432
<I> Last year on
The Dewelyn twins
kidnapping case.

130
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:47,003
Author, psychic,
Cayce Bridges.

131
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:49,939
<I>- Welcome.
- It's a pleasure, colin.

132
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,742
First off,
Why don't you
refresh our memories

133
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:54,611
About your-your gift.

134
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:56,580
Well, the gift i have--
Uh, that I've been given

135
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,315
Is called psychometry.

136
00:09:58,316 --> 00:10:01,450
When I come in
contact with an object

137
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:05,154
I begin to pick up
sensations from it

138
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:08,324
And impressions start
to form in my mind's eye.

139
00:10:08,326 --> 00:10:12,128
The impressions usually
involve the person who last
touched or used the object.

140
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:14,129
Are you being bombarded
by these impressions
all the time?

141
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:18,368
Well, during the course
of an average day
I'll usually

142
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:21,803
Pick up several impressions
at random without trying to,

143
00:10:21,805 --> 00:10:23,305
but i'm very much in control.

144
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:25,906
Do you know
what i'm thinking
right now?

145
00:10:25,908 --> 00:10:28,644
No.

146
00:10:28,645 --> 00:10:32,580
When you do decide
to zero in on someone

147
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,517
Do you instantly
know everything
about them?

148
00:10:34,518 --> 00:10:36,252
Their name?
Their address?

149
00:10:36,254 --> 00:10:38,686
Oh, i don't know,
I wish it were
that easy.

150
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:41,457
Unfortunately,
these impressions are
frustratingly random.

151
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,992
Much of what i get is

152
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:48,197
What one of the detectives
I worked with called
"Useless trivia."

153
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:50,998
<I>- How do you do it?
- Producer: camera one...

154
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,901
I mean,
A gentle, young woman
like yourself,

155
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:56,270
How do you handle
dealing with kidnappers
and murderers?

156
00:10:56,273 --> 00:10:59,774
Well, I don't
deal with them,
really,

157
00:10:59,777 --> 00:11:02,177
Face to face.

158
00:11:02,179 --> 00:11:04,879
I mean, I'm not there
packing a .38

159
00:11:04,882 --> 00:11:06,581
When it comes
time to pick them up.

160
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:08,415
<I>Colin:
But in a lot of ways
you get a closer

161
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,718
<I> To these people
than the police ever do.

162
00:11:12,389 --> 00:11:15,990
You actually never met
any of the people you
helped capture?

163
00:11:15,992 --> 00:11:17,925
( Whistling )

164
00:11:32,508 --> 00:11:34,576
Yes?

165
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:38,012
I wasn't adopted
actually until
I was eight.

166
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:40,948
You can imagine
how off-putting it was

167
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:42,517
To perspective
adoptive parents

168
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,452
To have this four
pr five year-old

169
00:11:44,454 --> 00:11:47,621
Suddenly blurt out
some off the wall
piece of information

170
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:50,191
About a distant relative
of theirs.

171
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:53,493
I was finally adopted
by a wonderful couple

172
00:11:53,496 --> 00:11:55,763
Who couldn't careless
about what i could do.

173
00:11:55,765 --> 00:11:58,632
They were two people
with simply nothing to hide.

174
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,800
And they've since
passed away.

175
00:12:19,356 --> 00:12:21,287
( Whistling )

176
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,893
The book is
"Split reflections,"
The author Cayce Bridges.

177
00:12:27,895 --> 00:12:31,231
Thank you.
It's 27 minutes
past the hour.

178
00:12:31,232 --> 00:12:33,300
We'll be right back.

179
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:42,809
How's it going,
kiddo?

180
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:45,078
- Okay.
- ( Smooches )

181
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,514
- I'm tired.
- Me, too.

182
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,516
How do you think
it went?

183
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,451
I'm your manager.
I'm prejudiced.

184
00:12:52,453 --> 00:12:54,219
But i just
got off the phone

185
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:56,622
With Raymond Tarr
Himself in New York.

186
00:12:56,624 --> 00:13:02,262
He thinks that you
came off intelligent,
attractive, charming.

187
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:04,463
Well, at least i don't
really have to be
those things.

188
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:06,165
I can just come off
like i am.

189
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:09,635
and he's that
much hotter for
the three book deal.

190
00:13:09,637 --> 00:13:11,637
He's coming into town
and wants to take us
to dinner

191
00:13:11,638 --> 00:13:13,706
tomorrow night
to talk about it.

192
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,641
Did he mention
"Lamp light"?

193
00:13:15,644 --> 00:13:17,677
Yeah, mentioned it.
Tarr loves it.

194
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:19,278
I told you that.

195
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:24,048
His fiction department
think they have the next
Ann Tyler on their hands.

196
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:27,252
But they still know
where their money is
with you.

197
00:13:27,253 --> 00:13:29,487
But you made it
clear to them,
right?

198
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,191
I can't spend
the rest of my life
focusing in on killers.

199
00:13:32,193 --> 00:13:35,493
Hey, i know how tough
these books are on you.

200
00:13:35,496 --> 00:13:37,862
That's the beauty
of this deal.

201
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:40,898
All you have to do
is deliver one

202
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:45,136
psychic detection
Non-fiction to them
in the next ten months.

203
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,105
<I> After that,
the other two books in
the deal can be fiction.

204
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,375
They can be
whatever you want.

205
00:13:58,318 --> 00:14:01,553
There's only
a handful of people
in the whole world

206
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,388
That can do
what you do.

207
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:06,223
None of them can
write about it like
you can.

208
00:14:06,226 --> 00:14:09,193
You have this
miraculous power

209
00:14:09,195 --> 00:14:11,896
to help people
in trouble.

210
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:15,199
You can't blame them
for wanting you
to use it.

211
00:14:18,103 --> 00:14:20,303
All i want is
a normal life.

212
00:14:20,306 --> 00:14:22,341
- Is that so wrong?
- One more.

213
00:14:22,342 --> 00:14:24,075
That's all
they're asking for.

214
00:14:24,077 --> 00:14:27,043
After that,
they'll publish
your fiction.

215
00:14:27,046 --> 00:14:29,346
With the deal
I'm going to sow
Tarr into,

216
00:14:29,348 --> 00:14:32,384
They'll publish
your laundry list
if you want.

217
00:14:34,052 --> 00:14:35,854
<I> ( Alarm sounds )

218
00:14:35,855 --> 00:14:38,922
I saw Mr. Cute talk show
host hitting on you on
the commercial breaks.

219
00:14:38,925 --> 00:14:40,925
Anything there?

220
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:43,059
He's seeing someone.

221
00:14:43,061 --> 00:14:46,029
Her name starts with a "C"
or maybe it's a "K."

222
00:14:46,032 --> 00:14:48,364
She's pregnant.
She's gonna tell him
this afternoon.

223
00:14:48,367 --> 00:14:49,967
It's a boy.

224
00:14:49,968 --> 00:14:52,469
I picked up on it
when he handed me
that water glass.

225
00:14:52,472 --> 00:14:54,571
Right.
Well, he's out.

226
00:14:54,573 --> 00:14:57,040
What about the guy
in the green room
with the red hair?

227
00:14:57,042 --> 00:14:59,175
I told you.
I'm not gonna get
interested in anyone

228
00:14:59,177 --> 00:15:01,143
- Till i can find
someone I can touch--
- I know!

229
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:02,612
Without reading
their thoughts.

230
00:15:02,615 --> 00:15:04,448
- Have you ever met
anyone like that?
- No.

231
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:06,416
- But he's out there.
- Oh, yeah?

232
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:07,918
- Hey!
- Sorry!

233
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,887
Not a problem.
It was my fault.

234
00:15:18,564 --> 00:15:20,597
Where's Mar Vista?

235
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:23,766
South of here
near the airport.
Why?

236
00:15:27,238 --> 00:15:29,705
You know,
Tarr's only going
to be in town a few days.

237
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,107
He's going to want
to take an answer
back with him.

238
00:15:31,109 --> 00:15:32,141
I know.

239
00:15:32,144 --> 00:15:36,446
It might be a once
in a lifetime offer.

240
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:39,048
Okay, okay, okay,
No more pressure.

241
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,283
You go home,
enjoy the new house

242
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:43,719
and give me a call
if you want to talk
about it later.

243
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,054
I'll be at my place
around 7:00.

244
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,589
Thanks for
everything.

245
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:48,524
You were great,
baby.

246
00:15:52,897 --> 00:15:54,863
<I> ( car alarm chirps )

247
00:15:58,235 --> 00:16:00,636
You all right?

248
00:16:00,638 --> 00:16:02,538
Yeah.

249
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,674
I gotta
go back inside
for a second.

250
00:16:04,676 --> 00:16:06,775
Did you forget
something?

251
00:16:06,777 --> 00:16:09,144
Coming through,
people.

252
00:16:09,145 --> 00:16:11,581
<I>Man:
All right,
stand by, everybody!

253
00:16:11,582 --> 00:16:13,315
<I> ( alarm sounds )

254
00:16:13,317 --> 00:16:16,251
You better come on in
If you're coming,
darling.

255
00:16:16,253 --> 00:16:18,720
<I>- Man: here we go.

256
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,625
<I>Tv host:

In Los Angeles.

257
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:28,765
<I> and this is
The KJAN TV action line
news midday report.

258
00:16:28,767 --> 00:16:32,467
<I> Here are anchor persons

259
00:16:32,469 --> 00:16:34,703
Good afternoon,
Los Angeles.

260
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:37,104
Leading the top stories
at this hour is murder

261
00:16:37,107 --> 00:16:39,040
in the community
of Mar Vista.

262
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:43,578
Our own Inez Villanueva
is at that location now.
Inez?

263
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,714
Inez:
Yes, Steve.
I'm standing on

264
00:16:45,716 --> 00:16:47,982
the 800 block of
Loma drive in Mar Vista.

265
00:16:47,984 --> 00:16:51,953
The body was discovered
at 11:45 last night
by neighbors.

266
00:16:51,954 --> 00:16:54,957
<I> The victim Roger Kimmelman,
51 years-old,

267
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:56,991
Was a retired
postal worker.

268
00:16:56,993 --> 00:16:58,960
Now, what has police
concerned at this time

269
00:16:58,962 --> 00:17:01,161
Is some kind of
calling card

270
00:17:01,163 --> 00:17:03,865
left by the suspect here
in the victim's apartment.

271
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:06,334
<I> According to sources
close to the investigation,

272
00:17:06,337 --> 00:17:09,438
A similar calling card
was found at the scene
of another murder

273
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,641
<I> in the Silverlake area
just two days ago.

274
00:17:13,643 --> 00:17:15,677
<I> ( phone ringing )

275
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:24,652
Will somebody out there
please pick up
five-five?

276
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:27,187
Roger Kimmelman's
blood type's
A positive.

277
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:29,056
You got it.

278
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:30,725
Yeah?

279
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:32,159
Detective Webber?

280
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,827
What can I do
for you?

281
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:36,264
Are you in charge of
the murder last night
in Mar Vista?

282
00:17:36,265 --> 00:17:38,366
- Uh-huh.
- I think I can help you.

283
00:17:38,368 --> 00:17:40,167
How?

284
00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:41,869
My name is
Cayce Bridges.

285
00:17:41,871 --> 00:17:44,372
I've worked with
the police before.

286
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:48,242
You're psychic?

287
00:17:48,245 --> 00:17:51,044
That she is,
partner.

288
00:17:51,046 --> 00:17:54,114
Captain Donner
just lassoed me in
the hall out there,

289
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,949
Filled me in
on Miss Bridge's
remarkable career,

290
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,819
Helping various
police agencies

291
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,590
With their toughest
serial killer cases.

292
00:18:02,591 --> 00:18:04,791
Seems our captain is
something of a fan.

293
00:18:04,794 --> 00:18:06,794
Asshole.

294
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:10,563
and we are to
gratefully avail
ourselves of her services

295
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:14,166
On this case,
commencing immediately.

296
00:18:14,169 --> 00:18:17,371
Look, we don't have
time for this crap.

297
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:19,205
You sit over there,
take all the notes
you want to take,

298
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,974
Just stay out of our way,
do you understand what
I'm saying to you?

299
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,745
Whatever it is you're
trying to hustle I don't
want to hear it.

300
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:27,947
<I> the T.D.N. report
came in

301
00:18:27,948 --> 00:18:30,451
<I> On those marks on
the living room carpet.
nothing conclusive.

302
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:33,720
Probably made by the victim
moving furniture around
the day before.

303
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:35,922
Holyfield--
He's coming up here with
the preliminary reports

304
00:18:35,924 --> 00:18:38,057
Today at 4:30.

305
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,792
Your middle name
is Tiryn.

306
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,828
T-i-r-y-n.

307
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,363
It was your aunt
Irene's idea.

308
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:46,900
Your wife's
maiden name
is Taylor.

309
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:50,836
You met each other
in a record store
in college.

310
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,971
She worked there.

311
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:54,773
( Chuckles )

312
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:58,645
You have
a small spot

313
00:18:58,646 --> 00:19:00,447
on your left
shirt sleeve.

314
00:19:00,448 --> 00:19:01,981
Mustard.

315
00:19:01,983 --> 00:19:06,652
You made a mental note
this morning not to take
off your jacket today.

316
00:19:06,654 --> 00:19:10,824
There's absolutely
no doubt in your mind

317
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:14,627
That this murder
last night in Mar Vista

318
00:19:14,629 --> 00:19:18,330
Is connected to that murder
a few days ago in
Silverlake.

319
00:19:18,332 --> 00:19:22,233
<I> Someone called in the station
this morning and confessed.

320
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:24,903
Fitzgerald?

321
00:19:24,905 --> 00:19:27,773
He's a crank
and you know it.

322
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:31,777
and a detective
named Manny

323
00:19:31,779 --> 00:19:34,513
<I> has owed you $20
for three weeks

324
00:19:34,514 --> 00:19:36,914
<I> and you're really
ticked off about it.

325
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:38,918
( Gasps )

326
00:19:41,188 --> 00:19:46,024
That calling card--
The killer's calling card,

327
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,392
The one that you won't
even tell the news about,

328
00:19:48,394 --> 00:19:50,729
It's something written.

329
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:54,099
An "F" and an "R."
"F.R."

330
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,636
"Fear."

331
00:19:59,706 --> 00:20:02,106
"Fear" and another
short word.

332
00:20:02,109 --> 00:20:04,374
I'm not getting it.

333
00:20:04,377 --> 00:20:08,113
He's written it on
the wall by both of
the bodies that you found.

334
00:20:13,653 --> 00:20:15,888
Blood...

335
00:20:15,889 --> 00:20:17,822
He's written it
in blood.

336
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:21,426
<I> Who's blood?

337
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,160
It's not the victim's.

338
00:20:23,162 --> 00:20:25,129
It's...

339
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,366
The other victim.

340
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:33,638
<I> He-- god,
he drained some of
the victim's blood

341
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:36,240
and saved it
until he kills again,

342
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:39,510
<I> and then he used it
to write fear something

343
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,778
On the wall
by the body.

344
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:46,650
He did it
to throw off
the police.

345
00:20:47,921 --> 00:20:51,155
Uh, let's have
the lab check on it?

346
00:20:57,696 --> 00:20:59,896
You had a cold
spaghetti sandwich

347
00:20:59,899 --> 00:21:02,265
<I> and cherry coke
for breakfast
this morning.

348
00:21:02,268 --> 00:21:05,401
And you don't
know it yet,

349
00:21:05,403 --> 00:21:09,639
But the killer's
already done it
again.

350
00:21:29,494 --> 00:21:31,527
Well?

351
00:21:31,529 --> 00:21:33,563
It's definitely
this street.

352
00:21:33,565 --> 00:21:35,464
An older woman.

353
00:21:35,466 --> 00:21:38,634
They say there's only
one lady that lives on
this street by herself.

354
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:40,537
Her name is Mrs. Reardon.

355
00:21:40,538 --> 00:21:42,639
She lives on
the next block.

356
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,903
He's been here.

357
00:22:17,642 --> 00:22:21,175
<I> ( light chime music
playing on truck )

358
00:22:32,022 --> 00:22:35,390
Wait!

359
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:37,358
He didn't use
this door.

360
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:40,629
He-he went in
another way.

361
00:22:40,631 --> 00:22:42,363
Another door maybe,

362
00:22:42,365 --> 00:22:44,398
Or a window.

363
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,170
He may not have,
but how about we
give it a try?

364
00:22:48,171 --> 00:22:51,974
( Knocking )

365
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,475
Nobody's gonna answer.

366
00:22:54,477 --> 00:22:56,510
( Knocking )

367
00:23:43,892 --> 00:23:45,859
( Shouts )
Mrs. Reardon?

368
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,436
Liver frying.

369
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:05,212
Web.

370
00:24:27,334 --> 00:24:30,470
No.

371
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:33,339
He didn't go beyond
this room.

372
00:24:56,831 --> 00:24:58,697
Webber:
Jesus!

373
00:24:58,699 --> 00:24:59,898
( Gasps )

374
00:25:07,743 --> 00:25:09,675
( Gasps )

375
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:27,993
<I>Cayce:
Yeah, Jess, I left there
about an hour ago.

376
00:25:27,994 --> 00:25:32,097
Uh-huh, the impressions
were unusually strong
this time.

377
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,369
Beats me.

378
00:25:38,372 --> 00:25:41,105
Oh, they'll probably
going to want to know
my whereabouts

379
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,640
At the time of each
of the murders

380
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:44,375
So you should expect
a phone call, okay?

381
00:25:44,378 --> 00:25:46,376
During the first one
I was out of town,

382
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,681
and during the second one
I was on television

383
00:25:48,682 --> 00:25:51,716
So we should be out of
that one pretty quick.

384
00:25:51,718 --> 00:25:54,819
Well, they want me to
go down to the house
again tomorrow.

385
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:57,087
Yeah.
I don't know.

386
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:59,023
Things were pretty
crazy there when I left.

387
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:03,661
This guy's
really bad news.

388
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:05,763
I hope they catch
him quick.

389
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,399
( Chuckles )

390
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,234
Yeah, i guess
I'm fully committed.

391
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:13,269
And, yes,
we can spring the news

392
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:15,305
On Mr. Tarr
tomorrow night.

393
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:19,443
Okay.

394
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,477
I will.

395
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:24,415
Good night.

396
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,383
( Beeps )

397
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,630
<I> ( classical piano playing )

398
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,142
Hi.
( Sighs )

399
00:26:56,048 --> 00:27:00,350
( Whispers )
That goes there.

400
00:27:08,359 --> 00:27:10,360
( Chuckles )

401
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,610
The body discovered
earlier tonight by police

402
00:27:28,612 --> 00:27:31,914
<I> has been identified
as Agnes Reardon, age 73.

403
00:27:31,916 --> 00:27:35,083
<I> Mrs. Reardon,
a widow, lived alone
in her Venice home.

404
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:36,852
<I> Because of the killer's
apparent ease at striking

405
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:39,221
<I> at often not so private
locations

406
00:27:39,224 --> 00:27:41,090
or gaining entrance
to victim's homes

407
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,259
Without calling attention
to himself,

408
00:27:43,261 --> 00:27:46,295
Department sources
say the police have
given him a nickname.

409
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:49,030
<I> They are calling him
"The shadow man."

410
00:27:49,032 --> 00:27:50,566
<I> In a minute,
we'll be joining

411
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:52,868
<I> the action line
sports team live
from Hawaii

412
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:55,938
<I> where the winchell cup
victory celebration is
just getting underway.

413
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,207
<I> We'll be right back.

414
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:04,815
( Woman humming )

415
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:15,691
I see her.

416
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:17,959
<I>Cayce's voice:
Mrs. Reardon.

417
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,563
<I> She's very small,
fragile.

418
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:23,832
<I> She has an ache
in her right leg.

419
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:26,500
<I> It's arthritis,
I think.

420
00:28:26,502 --> 00:28:28,636
Did anyone notify
her son yet?

421
00:28:28,638 --> 00:28:30,771
He's a lieutenant
in the navy

422
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:34,476
<I> on a destroyer stationed
off the Aleutian Islands.

423
00:28:37,347 --> 00:28:40,014
<I>Cayce:
There's someone there.

424
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,484
( Sighs )

425
00:28:43,485 --> 00:28:44,552
Is it the killer?

426
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:46,621
Yes.

427
00:28:48,524 --> 00:28:51,025
( Pants )

428
00:28:51,027 --> 00:28:53,427
He has a very large
hunting knife

429
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:55,695
with a red plastic
handle.

430
00:28:55,698 --> 00:28:58,031
He came this way
very fast.

431
00:28:58,034 --> 00:28:59,533
He stopped here.

432
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:01,001
This is where
he grabbed her.

433
00:29:01,004 --> 00:29:03,537
( Whimpers )

434
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:06,073
It's weird.

435
00:29:06,075 --> 00:29:07,341
What?

436
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:10,810
( Whimpers )

437
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:14,949
<I>Cayce:
He put on
a stocking mask...

438
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,217
<I> after he had already
grabbed her,

439
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,220
after she had
already seen
his face.

440
00:29:22,091 --> 00:29:24,590
Next, he pulled her
to the floor.

441
00:29:24,593 --> 00:29:27,895
I can't-i can't go
in there.

442
00:29:27,898 --> 00:29:31,999
Fear-- i'm picking up
terrific fear from
this woman.

443
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:34,001
She was absolutely
terrified.

444
00:29:38,274 --> 00:29:41,876
Gloves-- he put on
surgical gloves

445
00:29:41,877 --> 00:29:43,843
<I> and a stocking mask

446
00:29:43,845 --> 00:29:45,879
Because he knew
this was the image

447
00:29:45,881 --> 00:29:49,349
that would terrify
her the most.

448
00:29:49,350 --> 00:29:51,952
It's her fear.

449
00:29:51,953 --> 00:29:54,322
<I> Her fear, it's
very important to him.

450
00:29:54,323 --> 00:29:56,089
<I> He's feeding it.
He's sustaining it.

451
00:29:56,091 --> 00:30:01,994
It's almost
as if he knows
exactly what to do

452
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:05,299
To make her
that much more
afraid of him.

453
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,266
( Gasps )
Dear, god!

454
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:10,938
Concentrate
on him, Cayce.

455
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,539
Connect with him.
with him.

456
00:30:13,541 --> 00:30:15,507
( Sobbing )

457
00:30:27,888 --> 00:30:29,488
( Sighs )

458
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:31,456
What's the matter?

459
00:30:33,893 --> 00:30:37,295
<I>Cayce:
I'm some place else.

460
00:30:47,474 --> 00:30:49,475
Lady?

461
00:31:01,355 --> 00:31:03,821
<I>Wu:
Hey, Miss Bridges!

462
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:05,791
Come on,
snap out of it!

463
00:31:08,161 --> 00:31:10,661
Are you all right?

464
00:31:10,664 --> 00:31:12,898
I think so.

465
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:14,399
What happened?

466
00:31:16,804 --> 00:31:19,804
I don't know.

467
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:24,209
( Sighs ) Well,
I think i've given them
a couple of good leads

468
00:31:24,211 --> 00:31:26,244
If they decide
to follow them.

469
00:31:26,245 --> 00:31:28,279
They'll follow them.
They'll play dumb
at first

470
00:31:28,281 --> 00:31:30,681
but they'll follow them.
they always do.

471
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:34,185
Are you okay?

472
00:31:34,187 --> 00:31:36,254
Yeah, something kind
of weird happened
this morning

473
00:31:36,256 --> 00:31:38,289
at that woman's house.

474
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:40,324
<I>- ( Bell rings )
- Yeah, like what?

475
00:31:40,326 --> 00:31:43,294
Whoa, uh,
we'll take
the next elevator.

476
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:46,930
I have this
childhood thing
about suffocation.

477
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,965
Bye.

478
00:31:48,968 --> 00:31:51,235
Okay,
so what weird thing
happened to you?

479
00:31:51,237 --> 00:31:53,270
I saw something.

480
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:55,872
It was a vision
only it wasn't like
any i've ever had before.

481
00:31:55,874 --> 00:31:58,775
It was much brighter
and clearer than usual.

482
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:01,179
<I>- ( Bell rings )
- And i saw someone.

483
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:02,946
It was a man.

484
00:32:02,948 --> 00:32:07,552
It was like
he knew I was there.

485
00:32:07,553 --> 00:32:09,819
He knew i was
watching him.

486
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:23,133
( Ringing )

487
00:32:26,872 --> 00:32:28,905
Hello?

488
00:32:28,907 --> 00:32:31,841
<I> ( Man speaking
In spanish )

489
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:34,478
I think you have
the wrong number.

490
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:37,246
No, in fact,
I know you do.

491
00:32:37,248 --> 00:32:39,282
You have
the wrong number.

492
00:32:39,285 --> 00:32:41,952
<I> ( Dial tone )

493
00:32:41,954 --> 00:32:43,920
You're welcome.

494

( Ringing )

495
00:32:57,702 --> 00:32:59,202
Hello.

496
00:32:59,204 --> 00:33:02,605
<I> ( Man speaking
In spanish )

497
00:33:02,608 --> 00:33:06,243
<I>You have
the wrong numero.

498
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,278
<I>- Comprende?
- ( Man speaking
In spanish )

499
00:33:08,279 --> 00:33:10,879
<I>Man's voice:
Is that you?

500
00:33:10,881 --> 00:33:13,549
<I>- Hello, who is this?
- I'm trying to reach you.

501
00:33:13,551 --> 00:33:16,318
<I> Are you listening?

502
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,354
What?

503
00:33:18,355 --> 00:33:21,457
<I> Can you hear me?

504
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:26,262
Yes, i think your friend
has dialed the wrong
phone number.

505
00:33:26,264 --> 00:33:30,566
<I> Cay-ce...

506
00:33:34,838 --> 00:33:38,907
<I>Man's voice:
Cay-ce...

507
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:44,613
<I> It's okay to be scared,
Cayce.

508
00:33:44,615 --> 00:33:46,682
<I> You should be.

509
00:33:49,621 --> 00:33:51,554

light classical music )

510
00:34:06,236 --> 00:34:07,902
Waiter:
How is everything,
Mr. Tarr?

511
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:09,937
Oh, just fine,
Tommy.

512
00:34:09,939 --> 00:34:13,875
My husband never brings
home galleys, my dear.

513
00:34:13,876 --> 00:34:15,745
But yours he did.

514
00:34:15,746 --> 00:34:17,544
He said,
"Listen, you've got
to read this."

515
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:20,749
Well, I went
in the den,

516
00:34:20,751 --> 00:34:22,683
Sat down
and started to read

517
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:24,685
and I never moved
and inch

518
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:26,520
until I finished
the last page.

519
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,890
It was 4:00
in the morning!

520
00:34:28,891 --> 00:34:32,292
After that
she threatened me with
grievous bodily injury

521
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:35,429
If I didn't bring home
the galleys to your next
two books.

522
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:38,733
The truth be told,
Los Angeles is not
my favorite town,

523
00:34:38,734 --> 00:34:42,270
But when Ray said he was
coming out to see you,
Well...

524
00:34:42,271 --> 00:34:45,072
And now I understand
you're working on
a new book.

525
00:34:45,073 --> 00:34:48,575
Oh, Jessica filled
me in

526
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:51,211
On the details
this afternoon.

527
00:34:51,213 --> 00:34:53,413
It, uh, sounds
very promising.

528
00:34:53,416 --> 00:34:56,583
I suppose
I shouldn't
ask the subject.

529
00:34:56,586 --> 00:34:59,453
No, you shouldn't,
my dear.

530
00:34:59,455 --> 00:35:03,356
Well, at least i get
to read the galleys.
( Laughs )

531
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:10,264
Earlier you were
telling us how you
happened to meet Cayce.

532
00:35:10,265 --> 00:35:13,500
Well, I was flying home
From an A.B.A. Convention
In Dallas,

533
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:15,702
<I> one where i signed
Allen Brenner.

534
00:35:15,704 --> 00:35:18,738
<I> and the only flight
I could get back to...

535
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,473
( Silence )

536
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:35,254
( Gasps )

537
00:35:35,257 --> 00:35:36,823
Excuse me.

538
00:35:36,826 --> 00:35:41,027
Well, nothing
to worry about, Cayce.

539
00:35:41,029 --> 00:35:43,062
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

540
00:35:43,064 --> 00:35:44,631
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Uh-huh.

541
00:35:44,632 --> 00:35:47,732
I'll get you
another glass
right away.

542
00:35:47,734 --> 00:35:51,004
So, during
the layover

543
00:35:51,005 --> 00:35:53,606
I, uh, picked up
This Atlanta newspaper.

544
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:57,477
And there was a story
about a college girl
from South Carolina

545
00:35:57,479 --> 00:36:01,981
<I> who had helped catch
this really horrendous
serial murderer

546
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:04,584
<I> that they had been
trying to find
for months.

547
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:10,490
( Silence )

548
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,133
( Gasps )

549
00:36:22,203 --> 00:36:23,870
I'm sorry.

550
00:36:23,872 --> 00:36:25,837
Cayce?

551
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:30,876
The other night
we went to the opening

552
00:36:30,877 --> 00:36:32,712
Of the new
Jasper Jones' exhibit.

553
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:34,981
Have you seen it yet?
It's truly remarkable.

554
00:36:34,983 --> 00:36:37,616
No, but I hear
It's quite a departure.

555
00:36:40,787 --> 00:36:44,422
<I>Man's voice:
Cay-ce...

556
00:36:46,394 --> 00:36:49,494
<I> Cay-ce...

557
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:54,965
<I> How are you tonight?

558
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:56,199
<I>- Hmm?
- ( Brakes squeak )

559
00:36:56,201 --> 00:37:01,673
<I> I know who you are,
Cayce.

560
00:37:01,675 --> 00:37:03,875
<I> and i really like
your books.

561
00:37:03,877 --> 00:37:05,076
( Whimpers )

562
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:07,344
Cayce,
What's wrong?

563
00:37:12,553 --> 00:37:14,819
<I> It was
a big surprise

564
00:37:14,821 --> 00:37:18,322
<I> having you visit
my bedroom this morning.

565
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:20,257
( Door slams shut )

566
00:37:27,299 --> 00:37:29,333
<I> Your energy is very...

567
00:37:29,334 --> 00:37:32,269
<I> potent.

568
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:34,705
What is happening?

569
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:36,774
( Gasping )
It's him.

570
00:37:36,776 --> 00:37:39,677
It's the killer!
It's the shadow man!
He's talking to me!

571
00:37:41,347 --> 00:37:44,281
<I>Shadow man's voice:
This place is very
special to me.

572
00:37:44,283 --> 00:37:46,416
<I> I come here often.

573
00:37:46,418 --> 00:37:48,586
( Lights buzzing )

574
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:52,221
<I> I'm so happy
I finally have someone
to share it with.

575
00:37:53,593 --> 00:37:57,728
He's, uh...
He's at a mall.

576
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,797
I think he's getting
ready to kill
somebody.

577
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:03,532
( Chuckles )
She's not serious,
Is she?

578
00:38:04,636 --> 00:38:06,536
Which mall?
Where?

579
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:11,441
Listen, i swear.
I'm serious.

580
00:38:11,443 --> 00:38:13,477
I bet.
All right, dude.

581
00:38:13,479 --> 00:38:15,478
- ( Laughs )
- You guys always
give me a bad time.

582
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,615
<I>Girl:
I know.

583
00:38:17,616 --> 00:38:20,348
Do you recognize
any of the stores?

584
00:38:20,351 --> 00:38:23,586
It's a service hallway
for employees.

585
00:38:23,589 --> 00:38:25,888
<I>- Okay.
- I don't see any...

586
00:38:31,129 --> 00:38:33,996
<I>Shadow man's voice:
What do you think, Cayce?

587
00:38:33,999 --> 00:38:37,534
<I>- Girl:  who's that?
- Does she look good
to you?

588
00:38:37,535 --> 00:38:40,136
Oh, god.
( Gasps )

589
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:42,271
<I> ( Shadow man pants )

590
00:38:42,273 --> 00:38:46,041
<I> She's very nervous
walking here all alone.

591
00:38:46,044 --> 00:38:48,377
<I> Are you picking
that up from her, too?

592
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,912
( Whimpers )
Yes.

593
00:38:49,915 --> 00:38:52,949
Oh, god,
He's going
after her!

594
00:38:52,951 --> 00:38:54,917
<I> ( Shadow man
breathing heavily )

595
00:38:59,256 --> 00:39:02,224
- ( Exhales deeply )
- ( Shudders )

596
00:39:23,246 --> 00:39:24,681
Oh, god!

597
00:39:24,682 --> 00:39:27,549
<I>- ( Girl screams )
- ( Shadow man whistles )

598
00:39:30,187 --> 00:39:32,221
<I> ( Girl whimpers )
No!

599
00:39:32,222 --> 00:39:35,190
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Do you feel it?

600
00:39:35,192 --> 00:39:36,792
Yes.

601
00:39:36,794 --> 00:39:38,794
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Feel it, Cayce.

602
00:39:38,796 --> 00:39:41,495
<I> it's the fear.

603
00:39:41,498 --> 00:39:44,633
<I> There's no other rush
like it in the world.

604
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:48,904
Towne hills!
It's the Towne hills
mall!

605
00:39:48,906 --> 00:39:51,338
Okay, Cayce,
We know where
he is.

606
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:54,041
<I> You can break
away now.
Cayce!

607
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:56,411
<I>- Break away!
- I can't!

608
00:39:56,412 --> 00:39:58,378
( Screams )

609
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:03,818
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Just where I want her.

610
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,855
<I> Where we want her,
Huh, Cayce?

611
00:40:06,856 --> 00:40:09,123
<I>- ( Laughs )
- Oh, no.

612
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:10,791
Oh, god, please!
No!

613
00:40:10,794 --> 00:40:12,894
( Girl crying )

614
00:40:12,896 --> 00:40:15,629
( Screams )

615
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:17,932
No!

616
00:40:17,934 --> 00:40:20,202
( Screams )

617
00:40:22,872 --> 00:40:24,840
No!

618
00:40:29,112 --> 00:40:32,213
<I> The knife.
she's afraid
of the knife.

619
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:36,449
( Screams )
No!  No!

620
00:40:36,452 --> 00:40:41,521
<I> It's like it's in some
scary movie she saw
last night.

621
00:40:41,523 --> 00:40:42,922
God, no!

622
00:40:42,925 --> 00:40:46,893
No!  Save me!

623
00:40:46,896 --> 00:40:48,928
Help!
Let me out!

624
00:40:50,967 --> 00:40:52,999
<I> ( Shadow man panting )

625
00:41:00,075 --> 00:41:01,407
Don't!
Don't!

626
00:41:01,409 --> 00:41:03,342
( Screams )

627
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:14,620
<I> Stay awake.
Stay awake.

628
00:41:14,622 --> 00:41:17,123
<I> Fear me.
Don't faint!
Don't faint!

629
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,058
<I> Not yet!

630
00:41:20,462 --> 00:41:22,396
( Gasping )

631
00:41:22,397 --> 00:41:24,597
Cayce, let go!

632
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:27,100
<I> Don't worry about
the girl.

633
00:41:27,102 --> 00:41:29,634
<I> She's only fainted.
Only fainted.

634
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:32,105
Do you want a drink?
sit down, baby.

635
00:41:32,106 --> 00:41:34,808
That's a girl.

636
00:41:34,809 --> 00:41:37,643
<I> Of course,
that don't mean

637
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:40,213
<I> I don't wanna.

638
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:44,983
<I> Cayce!

639
00:41:44,986 --> 00:41:46,719
No!

640
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:53,192
Cayce, stop it!

641
00:41:53,194 --> 00:41:55,227
Cayce!

642
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:57,931
- ( Panting )
- It's okay.

643
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:03,536
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Mmm, she was wonderful, Cayce.

644
00:42:03,538 --> 00:42:07,339
<I> and so were you.

645
00:42:10,777 --> 00:42:13,545
( Gasps )

646
00:42:13,547 --> 00:42:15,515
( Telephone rings )

647
00:42:21,788 --> 00:42:24,555
Cayce:
Look, if i'm right,

648
00:42:24,558 --> 00:42:28,960
Then he probably knows
we're talking about him
right now.

649
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,264
He knows exactly
where to strike

650
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:35,267
And exactly when
to strike so that
no one can find him.

651
00:42:35,269 --> 00:42:38,670
The others I was
tracking never knew.

652
00:42:38,671 --> 00:42:40,804
This man knows.

653
00:42:40,807 --> 00:42:42,840
I think he's psychic,
too.

654
00:42:42,843 --> 00:42:46,144
And he's better at it
then I am.

655
00:43:09,203 --> 00:43:11,302
<I> ( Rock music playing
in passing car )

656
00:43:20,279 --> 00:43:22,246
( Pants )

657
00:43:57,249 --> 00:43:58,448
Hey!

658
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,252
Hey!

659
00:44:04,457 --> 00:44:06,456
Oh, hi.

660
00:44:06,459 --> 00:44:08,492
Hi.
I need you.

661
00:44:08,494 --> 00:44:11,861
Please, there's a killer
out there in one
of the cars.

662
00:44:11,863 --> 00:44:13,529
Please, come on!
Please, hurry!

663
00:44:13,531 --> 00:44:17,100
He's wearing
a baseball cap
and a black jacket.

664
00:44:17,103 --> 00:44:19,069
He's out there
somewhere

665
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,037
In a car alone.

666
00:44:23,609 --> 00:44:26,074
For god's sake,
Hurry.  Please!

667
00:44:26,076 --> 00:44:27,543
( Sighs )

668
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:40,122
- What the--
- Sweetie!

669
00:44:40,124 --> 00:44:42,091
Up that way!
Try up there!

670
00:44:48,933 --> 00:44:51,267
Hey, back off!

671
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,512
Driver:
What are you
staring at, buddy?

672
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:09,751
- ( Shouts in russian )
- Hi.

673
00:45:09,752 --> 00:45:11,554
I'm really sorry.

674
00:45:21,964 --> 00:45:24,066
Sorry.

675
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:26,102
Aren't you going
to radio it in?

676
00:45:26,103 --> 00:45:27,869
- He could still be
In the area.
- Radio it in?

677
00:45:27,871 --> 00:45:30,806
Yeah, you know,
you are a policeman.

678
00:45:30,808 --> 00:45:33,474
No, i'm not.
I'm a fireman.

679
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:41,249
<I>Cayce:
Thanks for following
me home,

680
00:45:41,252 --> 00:45:43,918
<I> and waiting till
I got all the lights on

681
00:45:43,921 --> 00:45:47,988
And staying
A few minutes
while i change.

682
00:45:50,194 --> 00:45:53,428
<I> Ignore the mess!

683
00:45:53,431 --> 00:45:55,564
<I> I-- two days
after I signed
escrow

684
00:45:55,565 --> 00:45:59,200
<I> I got yanked away on
a 26-day promotion tour.

685
00:46:04,406 --> 00:46:06,907
Thanks,
I can use it.

686
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:09,544
I always wanted
to see the inside
of this house.

687
00:46:09,546 --> 00:46:12,513
It's about ten times
bigger than mine.

688
00:46:18,320 --> 00:46:22,490
So, uh, feel like
telling me what's
been going on?

689
00:46:22,492 --> 00:46:23,991
What's wrong?

690
00:46:25,828 --> 00:46:28,328
Well, on a...

691
00:46:28,330 --> 00:46:30,364
Weirdness scale
of one to ten

692
00:46:30,367 --> 00:46:33,799
It would probably
register an 18, so...

693
00:46:33,802 --> 00:46:37,872
I'm really good
at solving other
people's problems.

694
00:46:37,874 --> 00:46:41,308
My problems?
Forget about it.

695
00:46:41,310 --> 00:46:43,777
Other people's
problems.

696
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:52,185
I'm a psychic.

697
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:54,288
I'm clairvoyant.

698
00:46:54,290 --> 00:46:58,525
And yesterday
I started to work
with the police

699
00:46:58,526 --> 00:47:00,560
on the shadow man case.

700
00:47:00,561 --> 00:47:02,529
Do you know about that?

701
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:04,731
And i found out
that the reason
he's so good

702
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:09,469
At evading the police
is that he's psychic too.

703
00:47:09,471 --> 00:47:12,138
And earlier tonight,

704
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:16,041
He took me along--
mentally took me
along,

705
00:47:16,044 --> 00:47:18,178
While he...

706
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:22,981
You're gonna
read about it in
the paper tomorrow.

707
00:47:26,187 --> 00:47:28,253
You don't
believe me, huh?

708
00:47:28,254 --> 00:47:30,289
It's not that.

709
00:47:30,292 --> 00:47:32,926
Look, i was
brought up on
a farm in Nebraska.

710
00:47:32,928 --> 00:47:37,196
77 acres,
All of it
perfectly flat.

711
00:47:37,198 --> 00:47:39,265
<I> Weren't many surprises
out there.

712
00:47:39,266 --> 00:47:40,865
You tend to see
everything that's
coming at you

713
00:47:40,868 --> 00:47:43,437
about ten minutes
before it arrives.

714
00:47:43,438 --> 00:47:47,640
You keep both your feet
squarely planted on
the ground.

715
00:47:47,642 --> 00:47:49,875
I just--
I don't know,
I have a hard time

716
00:47:49,877 --> 00:47:51,910
with psychic stuff

717
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:54,380
and ufos,
you know?

718
00:47:54,381 --> 00:47:56,849
A lot of people
have seen me do it.

719
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:59,051
Oh, sure.
I mean, really.

720
00:48:01,422 --> 00:48:04,323
Anyway, um,
I'm right next door

721
00:48:04,325 --> 00:48:07,660
If you need
anything.

722
00:48:07,661 --> 00:48:10,330
Thanks...

723
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:15,067
For at least
trying tonight.

724
00:48:15,069 --> 00:48:18,102
Listen, let me give
you my phone number
just in case.

725
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:27,613
Jack, i'm really not in
the mood to try and read
your mind tonight.

726
00:48:27,614 --> 00:48:29,347
No, that's not it,
I just changed
my phone number

727
00:48:29,349 --> 00:48:31,916
and I forgot it
for a second.

728
00:48:31,918 --> 00:48:33,885
I got it.

729
00:48:39,459 --> 00:48:40,926
It's your pen.

730
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:42,894
Yeah.

731
00:48:44,230 --> 00:48:46,063
Well, bye.

732
00:48:46,065 --> 00:48:47,832
Bye.

733
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,308
<I> ( phone ringing )

734
00:49:07,754 --> 00:49:09,788
Hello?

735
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,822
<I>- ( static crackling )
- Hello?

736
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:13,857
Who is this?

737
00:49:13,859 --> 00:49:15,894
<I>Jess:
Hey, sweetheart, it's me.

738
00:49:15,895 --> 00:49:18,228
<I> Sam, get out of here!

739
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,096
<I> Sorry about that.

740
00:49:20,099 --> 00:49:23,535
<I> The dog just went on
the bedroom carpet-- again.

741
00:49:23,537 --> 00:49:26,269
<I> I just wanted
to make sure you were
all tucked in okay.

742
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,739
<I>- I'm fine.
- Good.

743
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:31,908
<I> that was quite a scene
in the restaurant tonight.

744
00:49:31,911 --> 00:49:34,712
<I> It's gonna make
a fantastic chapter
in the book.

745
00:49:34,713 --> 00:49:37,213
<I> I don't think
The Tarrs expected

746
00:49:37,215 --> 00:49:40,250
<I> to get quite so close
to the action.

747
00:49:40,252 --> 00:49:42,152
<I> You know,
what about that?

748
00:49:42,153 --> 00:49:43,486
<I> I wonder if you're
going to be able

749
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:45,388
<I> to use them as
characters in the book.

750
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:47,425
<I> Cayce?

751
00:49:47,426 --> 00:49:49,493
I'm still here,
Jess.

752
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:51,995
<I> Are you sure
you're gonna be
all right there?

753
00:49:51,997 --> 00:49:54,030
<I> By yourself?

754
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:55,698
<I> I don't like you
being there alone.

755
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:58,669
Yeah, I think so.

756
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:00,603
I have a friend.

757
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:03,073
He's my neighbor
next door

758
00:50:03,075 --> 00:50:05,075
and he can help me
out if I need it.

759
00:50:06,578 --> 00:50:08,611
He's a firemen.

760
00:50:08,614 --> 00:50:11,081
<I> Oh, really?
and how long have
you known him?

761
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:13,717
Um, well, we just met
tonight.

762
00:50:13,718 --> 00:50:17,921
<I> Now is he the older,
distinguished
captain-type?

763
00:50:17,923 --> 00:50:19,956
( Chuckles )
No.

764
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:23,058
<I> Mmm, so he's
the young hero
calendar type.

765
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,162
<I> ( static crackling )

766
00:50:35,173 --> 00:50:37,872
( Screams )
Oh, god!

767
00:50:37,874 --> 00:50:39,509
Jack!

768
00:50:39,511 --> 00:50:42,646
Jesus, help me,
please!

769
00:50:49,853 --> 00:50:51,787
<I> ( rock music playing )

770
00:51:11,008 --> 00:51:13,942
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Hello, playmate.

771
00:51:13,944 --> 00:51:16,845
<I> I wasn't sleepy
when I got home.

772
00:51:16,848 --> 00:51:19,780
<I> I guess you weren't
either, huh?

773
00:51:21,117 --> 00:51:23,085
Cayce!

774
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:29,023
Cayce!

775
00:51:29,025 --> 00:51:31,160
<I> ( rock music playing )

776
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:38,767
<I> It's nice having
someone I can be with

777
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:41,436
<I> Who understands

778
00:51:41,438 --> 00:51:43,372
<I> what i can do.

779
00:52:05,294 --> 00:52:09,897
<I> I know what you'd like
more than anything.

780
00:52:09,899 --> 00:52:12,232
<I>- ( knocking at door )
- You'd like to see my face

781
00:52:12,234 --> 00:52:15,135
<I> So you can describe it
to the police.

782
00:52:17,641 --> 00:52:20,173
- ( Crying )
- Oh, my god.

783
00:52:20,176 --> 00:52:22,109
Hold me.
Help me.

784
00:52:22,111 --> 00:52:25,780
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Well, okay, here you go.

785
00:52:25,782 --> 00:52:28,348
( Laughing )

786
00:52:29,752 --> 00:52:31,285
( Screams )
No!

787
00:52:31,287 --> 00:52:33,353
Cayce, it's me!
It's Jack!

788
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:37,090
It's okay.

789
00:52:37,092 --> 00:52:41,762
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Sweet dreams.
( Laughs )

790
00:52:52,508 --> 00:52:54,408
Thanks for
the lift.

791
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:55,943
I'm going in
on the 72-hour shift,

792
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:58,278
- But i don't have to.
- There's nothing you
can do.

793
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,314
There's nothing
anybody can do.

794
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:01,949
I just have to stick
with the police until
they catch him.

795
00:53:01,951 --> 00:53:03,983
Kill him.

796
00:53:03,985 --> 00:53:06,253
- Thanks.
- Happy hunting.

797
00:53:18,834 --> 00:53:22,968
These flags show the location
where the four murders
have taken place.

798
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:25,338
This area here is
central to all four.

799
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:27,373
And that's
a damn big area,

800
00:53:27,374 --> 00:53:29,676
But we're thinking
that he could be
a hub killer.

801
00:53:29,678 --> 00:53:32,211
Uh, someone who kills
around a certain fixed
place,

802
00:53:32,213 --> 00:53:34,246
Like his home
or where he works.

803
00:53:34,247 --> 00:53:36,281
We'd like to drive
you around this area.

804
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:38,183
Maybe you can
pick up something

805
00:53:38,186 --> 00:53:41,020
From the surrounding
environment.

806
00:53:45,159 --> 00:53:47,860
<I> ( Police dispatch
chattering )

807
00:53:47,862 --> 00:53:49,828
Cayce?

808
00:53:51,499 --> 00:53:53,466
Thanks.

809
00:53:55,069 --> 00:53:57,903
Lake Tahoe's
really beautiful.

810
00:53:57,905 --> 00:53:59,137
You're gonna be
happy there.

811
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:01,239
Lake Tahoe?
What are you
talking about?

812
00:54:01,241 --> 00:54:04,109
Sergeant Wu's just
thinking about where
he's moving.

813
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:07,813
Wu, when did this happen?
what do you mean,
you're moving?

814
00:54:07,816 --> 00:54:10,716
I turned in my notice
this morning.

815
00:54:10,718 --> 00:54:12,885
I-I was gonna tell you
at dinner tonight with
the wives.

816
00:54:12,887 --> 00:54:14,920
Sorry.

817
00:54:14,922 --> 00:54:18,557
<I>Shadow man's voice:
How embarrassing, Cayce.

818
00:54:18,558 --> 00:54:22,493
<I> I used to have trouble
letting things slip like that,

819
00:54:22,496 --> 00:54:25,163
<I> but not anymore.

820
00:54:25,165 --> 00:54:27,198
<I> In case,
somebody hasn't
told you, man.

821
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,234
I risked
my life with you.
We hang out.

822
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:32,202
- Wait a minute.
- I got him!
I got him!

823
00:54:32,205 --> 00:54:35,407
<I>- ( Children yelling )
- Yeah, you've got me,
all right.

824
00:54:46,385 --> 00:54:50,021
<I>Cayce's voice:
He's on a residential
street on foot!

825
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:52,489
That's great, Cayce.
Any land marks
or street signs?

826
00:54:52,491 --> 00:54:54,525
Just houses.

827
00:54:54,527 --> 00:54:57,094
Um, not very big.

828
00:54:57,097 --> 00:54:59,128
Nice and neat.

829
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:01,131
Nice and neat
residential homes,
That's not around here.

830
00:55:12,445 --> 00:55:14,879
<I> Nice kids, huh?

831
00:55:16,683 --> 00:55:20,417
<I> Well, time to go to work.

832
00:55:22,488 --> 00:55:25,656
<I>Cayce:
He's at a back wall in the back
of one of the houses.

833
00:55:25,657 --> 00:55:26,990
<I> He's just jumped over.

834
00:55:26,993 --> 00:55:29,660
He's in
the backyard

835
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:33,697
<I> and he's moving
towards the house.

836
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:36,132
<I> ( Children yelling )

837
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:38,134
He's at
the side door.

838
00:55:40,473 --> 00:55:42,505
He found the key.

839
00:55:42,508 --> 00:55:46,611
It was in one of
those little fake rock
hide-a-key things.

840
00:55:46,613 --> 00:55:49,145
He's going inside.

841
00:55:51,149 --> 00:55:53,515
<I> He's in the kitchen.

842
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:57,053
There are kids' drawings
on the refrigerator.

843
00:56:00,959 --> 00:56:04,694
<I> in the refrigerator
there's leftover pizza

844
00:56:04,696 --> 00:56:08,464
<I> and a cup--
some kind of kid's cup.

845
00:56:08,466 --> 00:56:11,335
He's going into
the living room.

846
00:56:11,336 --> 00:56:15,538
<I> There's toys scattered
all over the floor, kids' toys.

847
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:20,075
<I> There's a baseball in
one of those plastic
display things

848
00:56:20,078 --> 00:56:22,112
<I> on the coffee table.

849
00:56:22,114 --> 00:56:24,313
I don't know
If there's anybody
home or not.

850
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:26,382
Can you see a tv?

851
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:31,855
- Yeah.
- Is there a trophy on it?
a football trophy?

852
00:56:34,659 --> 00:56:37,593
- Yeah.
- He's in my house.

853
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:39,328
That son of a bitch is
In my house!

854
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,798
<I> The kids will be home
any minute.

855
00:56:45,402 --> 00:56:47,670
( Humming tune )

856
00:57:23,174 --> 00:57:25,173
( Tires screech )

857
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,108
<I> ( Police dispatch
chatter )

858
00:57:38,654 --> 00:57:42,124
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Whatever you do, Cayce,

859
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:45,359
<I> Don't look
to your right.

860
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:55,036
<I> I watched the two kids
go inside a couple of
minutes ago.

861
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,071
<I> they're very cute.

862
00:57:57,072 --> 00:57:59,140
<I> You see now,
don't you?

863
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:01,675
<I> I can get to anyone.

864
00:58:01,677 --> 00:58:05,179
<I> I want you to stay
away from the police

865
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,748
<I> or i'm gonna come back
for the perfect children,

866
00:58:07,750 --> 00:58:11,218
<I> and the pretty wife
and the detective, too.

867
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:13,254
<I> Come on, Cayce,

868
00:58:13,257 --> 00:58:15,289
<I> We don't need
anyone else.

869
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,523
<I> It's just you
and me

870
00:58:17,526 --> 00:58:19,525
<I> and the fear.

871
00:58:28,905 --> 00:58:31,005
This doesn't make
any sense.

872
00:58:31,006 --> 00:58:33,506
Besides that,
the police are still
desperate to work with you.

873
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:35,877
I can't.
He'll kill Webber
and Webber's family.

874
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:38,111
I know he will.
Besides, there's
nothing the police can do.

875
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,281
He's always going
to be one step ahead
of them.

876
00:58:40,282 --> 00:58:42,316
You can move in
with me.

877
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,851
- We'll get bodyguards--
- That's not it, don't
you understand?

878
00:58:44,852 --> 00:58:46,887
He's not after me.
He likes me.

879
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:48,054
I give great fear.

880
00:58:48,056 --> 00:58:51,056
I've already made
last call, miss.

881
00:58:51,058 --> 00:58:53,092
I can't stay here.

882
00:58:53,095 --> 00:58:55,128
I'm a part of what
he's doing now.

883
00:58:55,131 --> 00:58:56,429
Maybe if i leave,
he'll slow down

884
00:58:56,431 --> 00:58:58,298
Or slip up somehow,
I don't know.

885
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,201
- All right,
I'll come with you.
- No, i have to be alone!

886
00:59:02,203 --> 00:59:04,837
Call me
and tell me
when you get there!

887
00:59:04,839 --> 00:59:06,540
I'll be waiting!

888
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:42,274
( Sighs )

889
00:59:47,314 --> 00:59:50,248
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Where the hell do you
think you're going, Cayce?

890
00:59:50,251 --> 00:59:52,984
<I> You can't leave me.

891
00:59:52,987 --> 00:59:55,020
<I> ( Shadow man panting )

892
00:59:55,022 --> 00:59:58,456
<I> Get off that plane,
Cayce, now!

893
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:04,997
<I> You're going
to New York, aren't you?

894
01:00:04,999 --> 01:00:07,666
<I> Why, Cayce?

895
01:00:07,668 --> 01:00:10,434
<I> Why are you
leaving me?

896
01:00:13,206 --> 01:00:15,405
<I> Don't test me.

897
01:00:15,408 --> 01:00:17,542
<I> Im warning you.

898
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:20,679
<I> Ill do anything
to stop you from going.

899
01:00:20,681 --> 01:00:22,446
<I> Anything!

900
01:00:22,448 --> 01:00:25,049
<I> (Shadow man
panting )

901
01:00:25,051 --> 01:00:26,985
Excuse me, miss?

902
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:29,019
When do you
shut the door?

903
01:00:29,022 --> 01:00:30,990
As soon as
everyone's on
board, ma'am.

904
01:00:30,991 --> 01:00:32,323
And how soon
is that?

905
01:00:32,326 --> 01:00:34,458
What?
Ten seconds?
20?  An hour?

906
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,460
Maybe a minute.

907
01:00:44,138 --> 01:00:47,839
( Whispers )
Close the door.
Close the goddamn door.

908
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:22,372
<I>Passenger:
John.

909
01:01:22,373 --> 01:01:23,973
Oh, hi.

910
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:25,943
( Sighs )

911
01:01:42,194 --> 01:01:43,526
Oh, god.

912
01:01:43,528 --> 01:01:46,796
Oh... Oh, no.

913
01:01:52,204 --> 01:01:55,739
Take care
Of yourself,
Kiddo.

914
01:01:55,741 --> 01:01:57,741
Stay safe.

915
01:02:13,725 --> 01:02:15,891
Ma'am, please,
you must stay
In your seat.

916
01:02:15,893 --> 01:02:17,593
You've got
to stop the plane!

917
01:02:17,594 --> 01:02:20,295
- Ma'am, please!
- No, you've got to stop
the goddamn plane!

918
01:02:20,298 --> 01:02:21,732
Somebody's about
to be killed!

919
01:02:21,733 --> 01:02:24,700
( Shadow man whistling )

920
01:02:28,272 --> 01:02:30,805
- What do you mean?
- Back there in
the terminal.

921
01:02:30,807 --> 01:02:33,709
You've got to stop
the plane now.

922
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:49,258
Please, ma'am,
just calm down and tell
me what the problem is.

923
01:02:49,260 --> 01:02:50,960
You have to let me
off this plane now!

924
01:02:50,962 --> 01:02:53,661
The only way he won't
do it is if i get off
the plane now.

925
01:02:53,663 --> 01:02:55,396
Who won't do what?

926
01:02:55,398 --> 01:02:58,466
Let me off
this plane now

927
01:02:58,469 --> 01:03:02,337
Or i will scream like
this all the way
to New York!

928
01:03:38,407 --> 01:03:39,739
No!

929
01:03:39,742 --> 01:03:42,475
No, I came back!

930
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:45,579
I came back!
You don't have
to do anything!

931
01:03:49,051 --> 01:03:51,084
( Screams )
No!

932
01:03:51,086 --> 01:03:52,653
( Muffled
cries )

933
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:54,587
No, no!
Please, don't!

934
01:03:54,589 --> 01:03:56,623
( Screams )
Help!

935
01:03:56,626 --> 01:03:58,658
Help!

936
01:03:58,661 --> 01:04:01,394
Help!

937
01:04:01,396 --> 01:04:03,330
Oh, please, no!

938
01:04:03,332 --> 01:04:06,665
Help!

939
01:04:06,668 --> 01:04:09,602
Not suffocation!
Jessica!

940
01:04:09,605 --> 01:04:12,940
( Muffled cries )

941
01:04:12,942 --> 01:04:15,342
<I>Shadow man's voice:
But that's greatest her fear.

942
01:04:15,344 --> 01:04:17,444
<I> I know it is, Cayce.

943
01:04:17,446 --> 01:04:20,981
<I> I read it
in your thoughts.

944
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:43,036
Why?  You didn't
have to do it!

945
01:04:43,038 --> 01:04:45,271
I came back!

946
01:04:45,273 --> 01:04:48,741
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Don't you ever try
and leave me again.

947
01:04:48,743 --> 01:04:53,413
<I> If you you do I will
kill one person an hour,

948
01:04:53,414 --> 01:04:56,949
<I> Every hour until
you come back to me.

949
01:04:56,951 --> 01:05:00,452
<I> You know I can do it,
Cayce.

950
01:05:00,455 --> 01:05:02,888
<I> and you know I will.

951
01:05:02,891 --> 01:05:05,926
( Breathes deeply )

952
01:05:07,263 --> 01:05:12,731
<I> That's my very
good girl.

953
01:05:21,142 --> 01:05:24,210
<I>- ( Doorbell rings )
- Cayce!

954
01:05:24,212 --> 01:05:26,477
It's me,
Jack Hays!

955
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:31,618
<I> I just came off duty!

956
01:05:31,619 --> 01:05:34,287
I didn't know
what you'd be
serving for breakfast,

957
01:05:34,289 --> 01:05:38,089
So I brought
red and white.

958
01:05:41,861 --> 01:05:45,063
Cayce:
The perfume came first.

959
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,069
There was a knock
at the door, I opened it

960
01:05:51,071 --> 01:05:53,171
and that was
on the mat.

961
01:05:53,173 --> 01:05:56,175
It's my scent.

962
01:05:59,079 --> 01:06:02,880
Next, came the shoes.

963
01:06:02,882 --> 01:06:05,750
They're identical
to a pair i ruined

964
01:06:05,752 --> 01:06:10,187
Two weeks ago
in Houston.

965
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,057
And then this.

966
01:06:12,058 --> 01:06:14,059
It was out there
this morning.

967
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:22,333
The police?

968
01:06:22,336 --> 01:06:25,870
I can't.

969
01:06:27,474 --> 01:06:31,343
You shouldn't be here either.
It's very dangerous for you.

970
01:06:33,446 --> 01:06:37,748
He killed my friend
Jessica.

971
01:06:40,119 --> 01:06:43,021
So if I leave
what are you going
to do?

972
01:06:55,201 --> 01:06:59,936
Look, Cayce,
I've been a firemen
almost 11 years now.

973
01:06:59,938 --> 01:07:02,473
<I> My first year
on the job
there was

974
01:07:02,475 --> 01:07:04,608
This four-alarm
structure call
downtown,

975
01:07:04,609 --> 01:07:08,078
<I> One of those creaky
old office buildings.

976
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,413
I was sent up
on the roof.

977
01:07:09,415 --> 01:07:12,550
An entire section of it
collapsed underneath me

978
01:07:12,552 --> 01:07:16,286
<I> and I fell 30 feet
to the interior floor.

979
01:07:16,288 --> 01:07:20,324
I spent the next seven weeks
on my belly in UCLA medical.

980
01:07:20,325 --> 01:07:23,327
But the minute
I got out of there,

981
01:07:23,329 --> 01:07:27,364
I went downtown
and i found an older
office building

982
01:07:27,366 --> 01:07:29,399
<I> and i went up on top
of that roof.

983
01:07:29,401 --> 01:07:32,635
<I> I covered every inch
of it over and over again.

984
01:07:32,637 --> 01:07:36,038
I knew that I had
to take charge of
the situation

985
01:07:36,041 --> 01:07:38,942
<I> or i'd never be able
to do the job
right again.

986
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:47,483
Don't sit around here
waiting for this guy
to take charge of you.

987
01:07:47,485 --> 01:07:49,553
Let's go after him.

988
01:08:03,401 --> 01:08:06,236
Is this the one?

989
01:08:06,238 --> 01:08:09,038
You recognize it?

990
01:08:09,040 --> 01:08:10,972
He's been
all through here.

991
01:08:16,548 --> 01:08:18,147
We may be here,

992
01:08:18,148 --> 01:08:21,284
But i don't know
what i'm gonna be
able to do.

993
01:08:21,286 --> 01:08:23,985
Do what you did
with all the others.

994
01:08:23,987 --> 01:08:26,020
Track him.

995
01:08:26,022 --> 01:08:27,756
( Sighs )
But he'll block me.

996
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:29,925
Look,
It's emotions
that get you

997
01:08:29,926 --> 01:08:32,828
Into your "alpha beta
whatever" state,
right,

998
01:08:32,829 --> 01:08:35,830
So that you can do
whatever it is you do.

999
01:08:35,832 --> 01:08:38,567
Use them.

1000
01:08:38,569 --> 01:08:40,801
Wait a minute.

1001
01:08:40,804 --> 01:08:43,539
I never told you
emotions were how i--

1002
01:08:43,540 --> 01:08:46,975
You read my books.

1003
01:08:46,977 --> 01:08:48,943
- One of them.
- Which one?

1004
01:08:48,945 --> 01:08:51,280
- Three of them.
- There's only three.

1005
01:08:51,282 --> 01:08:53,382
Well, they were laying
around the station house.

1006
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:57,153
One of the other guys had them,
So i flipped through them.
big deal.

1007
01:09:06,797 --> 01:09:09,463
( Shudders )
Oh, god.

1008
01:09:11,233 --> 01:09:13,267
He did it
in there.

1009
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:15,303
( Breathes deeply )

1010
01:09:15,306 --> 01:09:17,339
- Do you need
to go in there?
- No.

1011
01:09:17,340 --> 01:09:19,374
Good.

1012
01:09:19,375 --> 01:09:22,075
Um, are you ready?

1013
01:09:26,048 --> 01:09:28,015
Calm down,
Cayce.

1014
01:09:30,085 --> 01:09:33,521
I need
a strong emotion.

1015
01:09:33,523 --> 01:09:37,658
I need an emotion
that's stronger
than the fear.

1016
01:09:39,797 --> 01:09:43,130
I don't know.
Fear is pretty strong,
Though.

1017
01:09:43,132 --> 01:09:45,199
Okay, let's not
talk about it.

1018
01:09:45,201 --> 01:09:48,968
Just talk to me.
Tell me about yourself.

1019
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:50,371
Tell me about you
as a kid.

1020
01:09:50,372 --> 01:09:54,574
What?  Just your average
psychic kid's childhood.

1021
01:09:54,577 --> 01:09:56,243
Yeah.

1022
01:09:56,245 --> 01:09:57,745
Uh...

1023
01:10:03,185 --> 01:10:05,820
I remember once...

1024
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,689
It was
a few days before
my fifth birthday.

1025
01:10:08,691 --> 01:10:13,660
I was still living with
my foster parents
at the time.

1026
01:10:15,530 --> 01:10:21,501
And suddenly,
I knew where
my real mother lived.

1027
01:10:21,504 --> 01:10:24,437
My biological mother.

1028
01:10:24,439 --> 01:10:26,773
So, the next day
I got on the bus.

1029
01:10:26,775 --> 01:10:29,309
I was five years old
and I got on the bus

1030
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:34,815
And I rode to where
my real mother lived.

1031
01:10:37,652 --> 01:10:40,720
And I remember I walked
up the front steps

1032
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:43,155
And I looked in
the screen door,

1033
01:10:45,059 --> 01:10:49,160
And there, inside,
was this...

1034
01:10:49,163 --> 01:10:52,999
beautiful woman,

1035
01:10:53,001 --> 01:10:58,905
With her hair
tied up in a scarf,
vacuuming.

1036
01:10:58,906 --> 01:11:01,573
I had seen

1037
01:11:01,576 --> 01:11:04,877
God knows
how many women,

1038
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:09,948
Hoping that one
of them would take me
as their daughter.

1039
01:11:09,951 --> 01:11:13,585
And suddenly,
here she was...

1040
01:11:15,623 --> 01:11:18,123
my real mother.

1041
01:11:19,460 --> 01:11:23,529
And I knocked
on the door.

1042
01:11:23,531 --> 01:11:28,100
And when she came
and looked down at me

1043
01:11:28,102 --> 01:11:33,204
I thought she was
going to sweep me up
in her arms.

1044
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:37,374
But she didn't know
who I was.

1045
01:11:39,579 --> 01:11:43,281
I knew,
But she didn't.

1046
01:11:46,053 --> 01:11:50,923
And I sensed
That she didn't
really want to know.

1047
01:11:50,924 --> 01:11:53,891
And so I just
looked at her

1048
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:56,161
for the longest time.

1049
01:11:57,998 --> 01:12:01,999
And then
I walked away.

1050
01:12:02,001 --> 01:12:05,102
That was when
I learned

1051
01:12:05,105 --> 01:12:09,641
That not
everybody can do

1052
01:12:09,642 --> 01:12:11,376
what I can do.

1053
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:23,187
( Sighs )

1054
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:25,256
Cayce?

1055
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:27,124
I'm getting
something.

1056
01:12:27,126 --> 01:12:29,159
What is it?
What?

1057
01:12:29,161 --> 01:12:31,195
It's...

1058
01:12:31,197 --> 01:12:33,162
Um, water.

1059
01:12:33,165 --> 01:12:36,667
- Liquid moving very fast.
- Is he there?

1060
01:12:36,670 --> 01:12:38,335
I don't know.

1061
01:12:44,776 --> 01:12:46,343
He's there.

1062
01:12:46,344 --> 01:12:48,244
Where?

1063
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:49,615
I don't know.

1064
01:12:49,616 --> 01:12:51,115
God, i'm losing it!

1065
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:52,917
No, you're not.
No, you're not
losing it.

1066
01:12:52,919 --> 01:12:54,385
Concentrate.
Now look at me.

1067
01:12:54,387 --> 01:12:58,523
We're gonna do this
and we're gonna do
It together.

1068
01:12:58,524 --> 01:13:00,657
<I> ( Washing machine
whirring )

1069
01:13:03,329 --> 01:13:04,862
I don't believe
this.

1070
01:13:04,863 --> 01:13:06,863
What is it?

1071
01:13:06,866 --> 01:13:09,198
<I>Cayce's voice:
He's at the laundry.

1072
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,801
<I> The son of a bitch
Is doing his wash.

1073
01:13:11,803 --> 01:13:14,538
Does he know you're there?
Does he know you're
watching him?

1074
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:17,206
- I don't think so.
- Good.  You're doing it.

1075
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:19,410
You're blocking him out.
Keep concentrating.

1076
01:13:19,411 --> 01:13:22,779
We need the name
of the laundromat.
can you give me a name?

1077
01:13:40,731 --> 01:13:44,333
Cooperman's--
Cooperman's coin op laundry.

1078
01:13:44,336 --> 01:13:46,002
Yeah!

1079
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:48,038
- I'm gonna call
the cops!
- No!

1080
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:50,941
If he gets away
he's going to go after
Webber's family again.

1081
01:13:50,943 --> 01:13:53,409
- What do you want to do?
- We have to get a...

1082
01:13:53,410 --> 01:13:56,144
A license plate number,
Something that we can
give the police

1083
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:57,780
Even if he gets away
from the laundry.

1084
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:59,114
( Brakes screeching )

1085
01:14:38,388 --> 01:14:39,722
I got it!

1086
01:14:39,724 --> 01:14:44,326
Cooperman's coin op.
1411 Washington
Boulevard!

1087
01:14:47,864 --> 01:14:50,297
- How're you doing?
- ( Sighs ) yeah.

1088
01:14:50,299 --> 01:14:52,066
What's he doing?

1089
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:57,872
He's opening his mail
waiting for his clothes
to dry.

1090
01:15:02,445 --> 01:15:03,712
Ow!

1091
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:09,918
- Oh, god!
- What?  What?

1092
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:12,453
He knows.

1093
01:15:12,455 --> 01:15:15,257
Shadow man:
Cayce!

1094
01:15:16,925 --> 01:15:18,925
Goddamn it, Cayce!

1095
01:15:18,927 --> 01:15:21,329
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

1096
01:15:23,266 --> 01:15:25,733
- What's happening?
- He's tearing up
the place!

1097
01:15:25,735 --> 01:15:27,669
Just keep concentrating!
Don't lose him!

1098
01:15:29,404 --> 01:15:31,773
<I>Cayce:
He doesn't want
to leave his stuff.

1099
01:15:31,774 --> 01:15:34,942
He senses that the police
will be able to trace him.

1100
01:15:34,943 --> 01:15:36,978
( Chuckles )

1101
01:15:36,979 --> 01:15:39,313
And he's scared.

1102
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:42,215
Shadow man:
You can't do this
to me, Cayce!

1103
01:15:42,218 --> 01:15:44,250
I'm in control,
Not you!

1104
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:46,252
Get out of my head!

1105
01:15:46,255 --> 01:15:47,655
He's gonna
get away!

1106
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:49,623
( Shadow man pants )

1107
01:15:55,330 --> 01:15:57,664
There it is!
Cooperman's!

1108
01:16:08,643 --> 01:16:10,577
He's in the back!
In the alley!

1109
01:16:20,455 --> 01:16:22,455
( Screams )
No!

1110
01:16:26,393 --> 01:16:28,428
- Which way?
- I don't know.

1111
01:16:28,429 --> 01:16:30,396
I lost him.

1112
01:16:35,003 --> 01:16:37,136
<I>Shadow man's voice:
You caught me off guard once,

1113
01:16:37,138 --> 01:16:38,771
<I> but you're not
going to be able
to do it again.

1114
01:16:38,773 --> 01:16:40,405
<I> I won't let you.

1115
01:16:40,407 --> 01:16:44,745
<I> You are only really safe
person in this whole city.

1116
01:16:44,747 --> 01:16:47,547
<I> Do you realize that, huh?

1117
01:16:47,548 --> 01:16:50,149
<I> I wouldn't have hurt you
for anything.

1118
01:16:50,151 --> 01:16:54,653
<I> Now, i'm going to
hurt you worst of all.

1119
01:17:01,896 --> 01:17:03,929
I'd say let's
call it a night,

1120
01:17:03,931 --> 01:17:05,965
But somehow
the idea of
going home

1121
01:17:05,967 --> 01:17:08,332
And waiting for him
to come and kill me
doesn't sound like fun.

1122
01:17:08,335 --> 01:17:12,337
Nobody drives
across town to do
their laundry, right?

1123
01:17:12,338 --> 01:17:15,741
So this guy lives
around here someplace.

1124
01:17:19,246 --> 01:17:20,912
You got something?

1125
01:17:20,914 --> 01:17:23,181
<I>Cayce:
Something.

1126
01:17:25,051 --> 01:17:27,585
<I> ( Television broadcast
echoing )

1127
01:17:36,396 --> 01:17:39,865
Oh, god!
It's him!

1128
01:17:44,171 --> 01:17:45,603
<I>Cayce:
He's in a house.

1129
01:17:45,605 --> 01:17:47,806
<I> it's his house,
I think.

1130
01:17:47,809 --> 01:17:49,773
Is it near here?
Do you know?

1131
01:18:00,753 --> 01:18:03,053
Who the hell are
you afraid of?

1132
01:18:21,007 --> 01:18:24,108
He's-he's outside now.

1133
01:18:39,658 --> 01:18:41,458
He just got
into his car.

1134
01:19:06,385 --> 01:19:07,985
What?  What?
What's he doing?

1135
01:19:07,986 --> 01:19:09,718
Nothing!
He's nothing!

1136
01:19:09,720 --> 01:19:12,322
He's cruising
and eating a candy bar!

1137
01:19:27,839 --> 01:19:30,507
( Shadow man breathing
heavily )

1138
01:19:44,522 --> 01:19:46,722
Jack.

1139
01:19:46,724 --> 01:19:49,658
He's right behind us.

1140
01:19:53,397 --> 01:19:56,400
No, he has a gun in
the glove compartment!

1141
01:19:56,401 --> 01:19:57,967
I saw it.

1142
01:20:00,638 --> 01:20:04,772
I was blocking him.
I know i was.

1143
01:20:06,844 --> 01:20:09,444
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Peek-a-boo.

1144
01:20:09,447 --> 01:20:12,448
<I> I see you.

1145
01:20:14,118 --> 01:20:16,384
Oh god,
he's coming!

1146
01:20:19,389 --> 01:20:24,660
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Mmm, what your boyfriend
wants to do to me.

1147
01:20:24,661 --> 01:20:27,429
He's reading
your thoughts.

1148
01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:28,496
What?

1149
01:20:39,542 --> 01:20:42,344
<I>- ( Carnival music playing )
- Over there!

1150
01:20:42,346 --> 01:20:45,312
<I> ( Children screaming )

1151
01:20:45,314 --> 01:20:48,583
<I>Cayce:
He can't do anything to us
If there's people around.

1152
01:20:57,361 --> 01:20:59,360
Barker:
Get your drinks here, folks!

1153
01:21:16,645 --> 01:21:19,647
Dude, hey, you can't
leave it here!

1154
01:21:20,950 --> 01:21:22,549
Man:
Hey!

1155
01:21:22,551 --> 01:21:24,751
Are you the head of security?
I need to speak to the head
of security.

1156
01:21:24,753 --> 01:21:26,786
Slow down, friend.
Take it easy.

1157
01:21:26,788 --> 01:21:29,423
Cayce, where the hell
are you going?

1158
01:21:29,425 --> 01:21:31,226
I'm the only one
who can do it!

1159
01:21:31,228 --> 01:21:32,660
I'm the only one
who can stop him!

1160
01:21:32,662 --> 01:21:34,594
I--

1161
01:21:36,832 --> 01:21:39,766
<I> ( Distorted laughter )

1162
01:21:57,753 --> 01:22:00,219
( Shadow man whistling )

1163
01:22:23,278 --> 01:22:26,846
<I>Shadow man's voice:
I'm with you now, Cayce.

1164
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:30,383
<I> Should I touch you
on the shoulder

1165
01:22:30,385 --> 01:22:33,052
<I> and introduce myself, hmm?

1166
01:22:35,923 --> 01:22:38,558
<I> Are you ready for that?

1167
01:22:46,834 --> 01:22:50,303
<I> ( Shadow man pants )

1168
01:22:50,304 --> 01:22:52,771
<I> You thought i wouldn't
like it here?

1169
01:22:52,774 --> 01:22:54,806
<I> Too many people.

1170
01:22:54,809 --> 01:22:57,410
<I> On the contrary,

1171
01:22:57,412 --> 01:22:59,744
<I> I love it here.

1172
01:22:59,746 --> 01:23:01,813
<I> ( Peoples screams echoing )

1173
01:23:01,815 --> 01:23:05,350
<I> ( Shadow man chuckles )

1174
01:23:08,555 --> 01:23:10,523
<I>Salesman:
Ice cream!

1175
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:18,229
<I>Shadow man's voice:
Cayce.

1176
01:23:18,232 --> 01:23:21,166
<I> Where-where are you?

1177
01:23:21,169 --> 01:23:23,302
Come on,
You son of a bitch!

1178
01:23:32,411 --> 01:23:34,379
You go this way.
I'm going to cover here

1179
01:23:34,382 --> 01:23:36,080
And we'll meet
in the middle.

1180
01:23:36,082 --> 01:23:40,084
<I> ( Shadow man whistling )

1181
01:23:40,086 --> 01:23:42,285
( Whistling intensifies )

1182
01:24:19,024 --> 01:24:20,991
( Groans )

1183
01:24:24,763 --> 01:24:26,696
<I> ( Gears clicking )

1184
01:24:30,635 --> 01:24:32,603
<I> ( Distorted screams )

1185
01:24:44,148 --> 01:24:47,885
<I> ( Shadow man
Breathing heavily )

1186
01:25:14,446 --> 01:25:16,946

Cayce,
what are you doing?

1204
01:26:47,336 --> 01:26:50,437
You knew we were
following you
tonight...

1205
01:26:52,341 --> 01:26:55,809
Not because you could
read my thoughts

1206
01:26:55,812 --> 01:26:58,679
But because you could
read Jack's.

1207
01:27:02,084 --> 01:27:04,752
Well, Jack ain't here
anymore.

<I> On why he was here
athe carnival

his thoughts.
