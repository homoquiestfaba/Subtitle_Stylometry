[Boy] But the day of the
Lord will come like a thief.

4
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,981
The heavens will
disappear with a roar.

5
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,985
The elements will be
destroyed by a fire.

6
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:06,091
And the earth and everything
done in it will be laid bare.

Oh Cole, your grandfather
had a real upset last night.

13
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:21,494
Here, sit down, sit down.

14
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:24,864
I got it, go sit down.

15
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,806
[Woman] This is just
getting to be too much.

16
00:03:38,845 --> 00:03:39,646
He asleep?

17
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:42,882

[Cole clattering]

19
00:03:55,462 --> 00:03:56,830
I'll check in later today.

20
00:03:59,933 --> 00:04:01,266
Thank you son.

21
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:03,803
Thank you.

All right, squeeze my

24
00:05:09,969 --> 00:05:11,404
You sleep good?

25
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:34,961
Hey.

26
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:35,862
Oh hey, Ellen.

27
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,802
Please see to Davis.

28
00:05:42,836 --> 00:05:44,871
He won't listen to us anymore.

29
00:05:44,904 --> 00:05:45,839
[Cole] Yes ma'am.

30
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,677
[Woman] Really, take it easy.

31
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,277
[Cole] How about we try this?

32
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,848
You like pudding, don't you?

33
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,317
[Davis] Yeah, but-

34
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,586
- Yeah, you see
this lid right here?

35
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,988
Yeah.

36
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:03,288
This means they
didn't contaminate it.

37
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,460
It's safe.

38
00:06:07,494 --> 00:06:08,862
[Davis] That proves
it, the lid proves it?

39
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,929
It proves it.

40
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:11,865
One, two, three.

41
00:06:15,034 --> 00:06:16,770
Anything happen?

42
00:06:16,803 --> 00:06:18,471
No, not yet

43
00:06:18,505 --> 00:06:20,039
[Cole] All right,
you want to try it?

44
00:06:20,073 --> 00:06:21,306
[Davis] Just a little bit.

45
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,442
[Cole] Just a little bit.

46
00:06:22,475 --> 00:06:24,010
You gotta trust me though,
look at me, you trust me?

47
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,948
You hungry?

48
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:30,817
Yeah.

49
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,452
[Davis] I ain't supposed
to eat dessert before dinner.

50
00:06:32,485 --> 00:06:34,286
That's all right,
there's no rules here.

51
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,995
[Randy] Hey, Cole.

52
00:06:42,028 --> 00:06:43,429
Hey, Randy.

53
00:06:43,463 --> 00:06:44,964
[Randy] Ellen almost through?

54
00:06:44,998 --> 00:06:45,865
Ah, yeah.

55
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,671
Hey, I hear congratulations
are in order.

56
00:06:51,704 --> 00:06:52,505
Thank you.

57
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,642
Yeah, you gotta
lock down the goods.

58
00:06:55,675 --> 00:06:56,776
[Cole] Yeah, you do.

59
00:06:57,944 --> 00:06:59,479
You still seeing
the Carson girl?

60
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:02,949
- I am.
- Always liked that girl.

61
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,886
I mean, you got
yourself a good one too.

62
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:09,989
I hear what you're saying.

63
00:07:11,124 --> 00:07:12,425
See you later.

64
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:13,860
[Cole] See you.

65
00:07:17,597 --> 00:07:19,999
[both moaning]

66
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:50,630
Are you working tonight?

67
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:52,932
[Carson] Night shift.

68
00:07:52,966 --> 00:07:54,734
[Cole] Night shift?

69
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,568
No night shift, no.

70
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:00,440
Don't look at me like
that, we don't have time.

71
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:09,148
That me making your
heart beat so fast?

72
00:08:09,182 --> 00:08:10,383
Sometimes.

73
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,720
It's nice.

74
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,528
I got a new manager.

75
00:08:25,498 --> 00:08:26,132
Guess who.

76
00:08:28,001 --> 00:08:29,402
You won't believe who it is.

77
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:34,540
You ain't curious?

78
00:08:34,574 --> 00:08:35,408
No.

79
00:08:36,075 --> 00:08:37,076
No?

80
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:37,911
No.

81
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:40,647
Fine.

82
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,149
[Cole chuckles]

83
00:08:48,254 --> 00:08:50,023
Come on, baby,
don't you feel that?

84
00:08:51,624 --> 00:08:52,926
I don't feel a thing, darling.

85
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:58,498
- Feel this?
- No, do you feel this?

86
00:08:59,933 --> 00:09:02,936
[light ambient music]

87
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:35,568
[Reese] Should
have been here, man!

88
00:09:35,601 --> 00:09:37,236
Was it a good time.

89
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,005
[Cole] Yeah, looks it.

90
00:09:39,038 --> 00:09:43,743
Bless old Ruthie's heart
though, she don't hear a thing.

91
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:47,580
Hey, I'm good to her,
and I'm good to you.

92
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:57,256
I don't see why you don't
just take from that home though.

93
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,559
They got pills coming
out their eyeballs.

94
00:10:02,161 --> 00:10:04,664
I'm not gonna take from
those people, you know that.

95
00:10:04,697 --> 00:10:07,734
"I'm not gonna take from
those people, you know that."

96
00:10:08,835 --> 00:10:10,136
You are such a choir boy.

97
00:10:11,738 --> 00:10:13,106
Today's your lucky day though,

98
00:10:13,139 --> 00:10:14,907
we're lousy with oxy this month.

99
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:18,845
You sure Ruthie
don't need these?

100
00:10:18,878 --> 00:10:21,214
Yes I'm sure, Ruthie,
don't need those.

101
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:24,117
We got scripts from
four different docs.

102
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:24,951
We're good.

103
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,521
Thank you very much.

104
00:10:29,689 --> 00:10:30,623
Well, looky, looky.

105
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:33,993
Come on, get you some.

106
00:10:34,027 --> 00:10:34,827
[Cole] No, I'm good.

107
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:35,661
You're good?

108
00:10:36,996 --> 00:10:37,997
No.

109
00:10:38,031 --> 00:10:39,032
I'm okay.

110
00:10:39,065 --> 00:10:40,166
[Reese] When'd you quit?

111
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:41,934
I never started.

112
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:45,071
It was a good fucking party.

113
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,873
[Cole] I keep hearing that.

114
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:48,941
Yeah, I throw good fucking
parties, what can I say?

115
00:10:50,977 --> 00:10:51,944
[Man] Hey buddy.

116
00:10:51,978 --> 00:10:52,779
Hey.

117
00:10:52,812 --> 00:10:53,613
Good to see.

118
00:10:53,646 --> 00:10:55,014
You too.

119
00:10:55,048 --> 00:10:56,082
We're good?

120
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:56,983
Yeah, I'm good, you good?

121
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,251
Yeah, I am now.

122
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:59,218
All right, take care.

123
00:10:59,252 --> 00:11:00,053
Okay.

124
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:12,865
Evening, doc.

125
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:16,736

Clyde always was a character.

129
00:11:46,132 --> 00:11:47,767
You give him my best

130
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,169
and y'all just let me
know what you decide.

131
00:11:50,203 --> 00:11:52,839
- We will.
- Evening, ladies.

132
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:56,275
Howdy.

133
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:01,948
[women chattering]

134
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,018
Did I miss something?

135
00:12:06,052 --> 00:12:09,021
No, the girls just
came by for a visit.

136
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:10,123
Check on daddy.

137
00:12:10,156 --> 00:12:11,691
Yeah, he's worse, you know.

138
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:16,762
What did he want?

139
00:12:16,796 --> 00:12:19,065
Now Cole, don't
get upset, but-

140
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:20,434
- We need to make sure

141
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:22,402
that mama and daddy
are provided for.

142
00:12:22,436 --> 00:12:25,037
[Woman] These revelation movers
aren't gonna last forever.

143
00:12:25,071 --> 00:12:28,774
And there ain't no retirement
plans for country preachers.

144
00:12:28,808 --> 00:12:30,209
I take good care of them.

145
00:12:30,243 --> 00:12:31,911
He does, he takes
very good care of us.

146
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:33,813
But it ain't his land, mama.

147
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:34,981
It's ours.

148
00:12:35,014 --> 00:12:35,948
Ours and his mama.

149
00:12:39,819 --> 00:12:41,954
Well, she ain't here, is she?

150
00:12:49,996 --> 00:12:51,097
[Woman] Why couldn't you just

151
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,099
be a little more
gentle with him?

152
00:12:53,132 --> 00:12:57,336
[Woman #2] Sorry, but
someones gotta say something.

153
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:03,776
Angels.

154
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,347
Angels and vultures.

155
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:12,785
Can't rest.

156
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,957
Can't rest with them
birds squawking around.

157
00:13:22,228 --> 00:13:24,063
Peck at you, peck, peck, peck.

158
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:27,099
Peck till there's nothing left.

159
00:13:33,973 --> 00:13:36,809
[Clyde groans]

160
00:13:36,842 --> 00:13:37,977
And I hear you thinking,

161
00:13:39,946 --> 00:13:43,983
now that the kingdom of
heaven is so close[coughing].

162
00:13:50,122 --> 00:13:52,291
Slow down.
[Clyde coughing]

163
00:13:52,325 --> 00:13:53,960
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

164
00:13:56,195 --> 00:13:57,029
Slow down.

165
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,233
That's right.

166
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,903
- Oh Lord.
- That's right.

167
00:14:03,936 --> 00:14:07,474
[Clyde] Thessalonians 4:16.

168
00:14:14,814 --> 00:14:17,049
For the Lord himself
will come down from heaven

169
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:19,885
with a loud command,

170
00:14:22,121 --> 00:14:23,889
with the voice of the archangel

171
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:27,760
and with the
trumpet call of God,

172
00:14:30,397 --> 00:14:31,998
and the dead in Christ
will rise first.

173
00:14:35,234 --> 00:14:37,169
[Clyde] Hallelujah.

[dramatic guitar music]

175
00:14:52,151 --> 00:14:53,819
I appreciate it, Kelly.

[Man] Terry Rose,
as I live and breathe!

178
00:15:05,865 --> 00:15:08,367
[Terry] Oh come here,
you skinny son of a bitch.

179
00:15:08,402 --> 00:15:10,537
Last time I saw you I
get my hands on you.

180
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,370
What's good, man?

181
00:15:11,405 --> 00:15:13,005
You good?

182
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:14,340
Yeah, I'm doing all
right man, I'm pretty good.

183
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:15,374
I'll talk to you

Proverbs 23:13.

Do not withhold
discipline from a child.

I don't know.

431
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:42,254
That's all you got to
say after all this time?

432
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:45,358
You ain't even the least bit-

433
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:47,226
- What's this got
to do with you?

434
00:32:51,163 --> 00:32:56,168
Wow.

[Cole] I'm all right.

442

You don't look it,
don't mind me saying.

443
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:54,093
I'm fine.

444
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,330
Y'all gonna settle
now he's gone?

00:33:59,666 --> 00:34:01,167
No, we're not going anywhere.

446
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,571
Oh, I'm happy to hear that.

447
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:07,273
I mean, it's nice to see
somebody's not giving in.

448
00:34:09,241 --> 00:34:11,010
Hey, buddy.

449
00:34:11,043 --> 00:34:14,614
Oh, look who it is, our
most devoted new customer.

453
00:34:27,394 --> 00:34:29,195
Real sorry to hear
about Clyde, man.

454
00:34:34,534 --> 00:34:35,334
Thanks.

455
00:34:39,406 --> 00:34:41,408
At least you know
what's happening,

456
00:34:41,441 --> 00:34:43,108
finally up close
with the big guy.

457
00:34:46,278 --> 00:34:47,112
You got a point.

458
00:34:50,182 --> 00:34:51,485
Well, I can't do too much,

459
00:34:51,518 --> 00:34:52,619
but I can get you
drunker than hell.

460
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:55,221
Here you go.

461
00:35:04,464 --> 00:35:07,634
I might as well
drink the third one.

462
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:11,270
How was I supposed to know

463
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:12,806
you couldn't piss by
a playground, man?

464
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,708
[both chuckling]

465
00:35:14,741 --> 00:35:18,110
- You haven't changed at all.
- Everybody doing all right?

466
00:35:18,143 --> 00:35:19,245
[Cole] Yeah, we're
doing all right.

467
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:28,320
Oh, man.

468
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:34,093
Crazy, crazy is those fuckers
over there in Campbell, man.

469
00:35:36,128 --> 00:35:37,497
They're fucking crazy,

470
00:35:37,531 --> 00:35:39,131
I knew a guy who cooked
meth in his trailer,

471
00:35:39,164 --> 00:35:41,033
damn near blew the
roof right off, man.

472
00:35:42,301 --> 00:35:43,202
You ever try it?

473
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:46,105
No.

474
00:35:47,774 --> 00:35:49,108
It's pretty wild, man.

475
00:35:49,976 --> 00:35:52,111
Wouldn't be your
kind of buzz though.

476
00:35:52,144 --> 00:35:53,178
[Cole] Really?

477
00:35:53,212 --> 00:35:56,248
Really, I'm pretty sure.

478
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:58,284
Your friend, your friend Reese,

479
00:35:59,452 --> 00:36:01,186
I mean I hear that fairy

480
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,623
can't put it up his nose
fast enough, crystal, ox.

481
00:36:07,159 --> 00:36:09,194
I guess some guys just
like to swing both ways.

482
00:36:09,228 --> 00:36:11,263
[Cole] Why you keep
asking around then?

483
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:15,535
Well, I'm working with some
boys up the way, you know.

484
00:36:17,871 --> 00:36:19,371
Gonna start our own operation.

485
00:36:21,173 --> 00:36:23,142
And the way I see it a lot
of folks around are going

486
00:36:23,175 --> 00:36:28,180
to be graduating from
the service you provide.

487
00:36:31,451 --> 00:36:34,086
Well, my what?

488
00:36:35,321 --> 00:36:36,489
[Terry] You wanna
go in with me?

489
00:36:41,461 --> 00:36:43,496
You already know all
the best customers.

490
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:46,198
You don't wanna
mess with junk, man.

491
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:48,267
There's a fella in town.

492
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,437
Everett, Everett
won't know about it.

493
00:36:51,471 --> 00:36:53,272
[Cole] Oh yeah?

494
00:36:53,305 --> 00:36:55,307
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, no, no, no, no, no.

495
00:36:55,341 --> 00:36:56,476
I'm gonna diversify.

496
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:01,347
Chrissy hasn't gone
anywhere, it's just on cops,

497
00:37:01,381 --> 00:37:02,749
the back burner so to speak.

498
00:37:04,283 --> 00:37:05,284
That's funny.

499
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:06,620
Stupid.

500
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:08,320
Yeah, I need a place to cook,

501
00:37:08,354 --> 00:37:10,122
I was thinking about
that old church of yours.

502
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:14,728
It's nothing but
crumbling walls now.

503
00:37:14,761 --> 00:37:16,696
[Terry] I could
park something there.

504
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:21,133
Not on our land, Terry,
that's not gonna happen.

505
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:31,276
All right.

506
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,148
Sole proprietor on
this one, I got it.

507
00:37:38,217 --> 00:37:42,187
I'd be careful about who
you're telling your ideas to.

508
00:37:45,592 --> 00:37:47,794
This town is small, it
already has its ways.

509
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:57,937
Just in a pretty
deep hole is all.

510
00:38:01,975 --> 00:38:06,680
It's time to start
digging out, you know?

511
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:09,616
Yeah.

512
00:38:14,788 --> 00:38:16,623
You remember when
we cut our hands?

513
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:20,359
Like a couple buffalo
jockies, you remember that?

514
00:38:20,393 --> 00:38:21,961
Yes, stupid kids.

515
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,901
[Terry] The blood
runs thick, don't it?

516
00:38:32,939 --> 00:38:34,373
That it does.

517
00:38:34,407 --> 00:38:36,943
[dramatic music]

518
00:38:42,682 --> 00:38:46,218
How dear to my heart are
the scenes of my childhood,

519
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:50,957
when fond recollections
presents them to view.

520
00:38:52,759 --> 00:38:57,764
The orchard, the meadow,
the deep tangled wildwood,

521
00:38:59,566 --> 00:39:02,301
and ev'ry loved spot
which my infancy knew.

522
00:39:04,037 --> 00:39:08,608
The wide spreading pond, and
the mill that stood by it.

523
00:39:08,641 --> 00:39:11,711
The bridge and the rock
where the cataract fell.

524
00:39:14,714 --> 00:39:16,348
It's real nice
you read to her.

525
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,454
I am real nice.

526
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:24,356
Contrary to what
you may have heard.

527
00:39:35,435 --> 00:39:39,405
Look, buddy, I got
nothing for you.

528
00:39:46,412 --> 00:39:47,947
[Cole] You selling elsewhere?

529
00:39:49,516 --> 00:39:50,315
Fuck you.

530
00:39:52,786 --> 00:39:55,021
Who's been advising
you since day one

531
00:39:55,054 --> 00:39:57,757
of this little venture yours?

532
00:39:57,791 --> 00:39:58,625
Huh?

533
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:00,393
What do I get?

534
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:04,329
Terry fucking Rose up
my ass day and night

535
00:40:04,363 --> 00:40:07,033
saying you told him I can
help him cook up some crack.

536
00:40:07,066 --> 00:40:08,067
I didn't.

537
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,736
[Reese] No, fuck you

538
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:10,970
for bringing that kind
shit back in my life.

539
00:40:12,705 --> 00:40:14,107
I never said that, Reese.

540
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,009
This here's Ruthie's home.

541
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:20,013
I ain't gonna mess
with her estate.

542
00:40:20,046 --> 00:40:21,648
That little prick's so hard up,

543
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:23,016
he can shake and bake
like everybody else,

544
00:40:23,049 --> 00:40:24,717

01:25:14,674 --> 01:25:17,410
[dramatic music]

1090
01:25:21,715 --> 01:25:22,549
Come on.

1091
01:25:25,819 --> 01:25:26,653
Come on.

1092
01:25:29,589 --> 01:25:31,791
I'll be over by the warmth.

1093
01:25:31,825 --> 01:25:34,528
[dramatic music]

1094
01:25:44,871 --> 01:25:48,642
[Cole] Why'd you
want to meet here?

1095
01:25:48,675 --> 01:25:51,478
[Terry] 'Cause
this was our place.

1096
01:25:51,511 --> 01:25:54,313
Can't stand to look at
it now, glad it's dark.

1097
01:26:00,554 --> 01:26:02,489
I'm running out of
lives here, man.

1098
01:26:05,425 --> 01:26:06,258
[Cole] I know.

1099
01:26:14,166 --> 01:26:15,635
I got a guy coming
to town tomorrow night

1100
01:26:15,669 --> 01:26:19,238
with a serious package at H.

1101
01:26:21,474 --> 01:26:25,845
It's way better than that
Mexican horse floating around.

1102
01:26:30,249 --> 01:26:33,587
I don't pay, I'm a dead man.

1103
01:26:35,555 --> 01:26:37,222
I need some money, now.

1104
01:26:37,256 --> 01:26:39,459
[Cole] How many times
I got to tell you no?

1105
01:26:39,492 --> 01:26:41,327
- [Terry] Well, I'll-
- No.

1106
01:26:41,360 --> 01:26:43,663
[Terry] I'll pay you back,
get ya a cut once I sell it.

1107
01:26:43,697 --> 01:26:47,266
Do you understand what
Everett is capable of?

1108
01:26:47,299 --> 01:26:48,735
He's got enough
to worry about.

1109
01:26:50,169 --> 01:26:52,304
If little Jodie
Hampton ever wakes up,

1110
01:26:53,473 --> 01:26:57,309
she can tell the whole world
who sold her that dirty tar.

1111
01:27:10,790 --> 01:27:13,393
[Terry laughs]

1112
01:27:14,427 --> 01:27:15,495
Look at you.

1113
01:27:15,528 --> 01:27:18,297
[dramatic music]

1114
01:27:23,603 --> 01:27:24,804
Look at you.

1115
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:35,415
Always the same furrowed brow,
and you're fit to be tied.

1116
01:27:38,785 --> 01:27:41,588
[dramatic music]

1117
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:48,428
We might as well be 17 again.

1118
01:28:12,485 --> 01:28:14,319
Man, why should
I trust you now?

1119
01:28:18,825 --> 01:28:20,259
We were brothers.

1120
01:28:20,292 --> 01:28:22,595
[Cole laughs]

1121
01:28:23,530 --> 01:28:26,331
[Terry laughs]

1122
01:28:28,468 --> 01:28:30,269
We ain't kin.

1123
01:28:30,302 --> 01:28:32,839
[dramatic music]

1124
01:29:03,470 --> 01:29:06,338
Don't seem like so
long ago, does it?

1125
01:29:06,371 --> 01:29:07,640
[dramatic music]

1126
01:29:07,674 --> 01:29:10,342
[Cole laughing]

1127
01:29:13,446 --> 01:29:15,314
It does to me.

1128
01:29:23,056 --> 01:29:25,324
I wish someone told me then,

1129
01:29:30,096 --> 01:29:32,599
given me some goddamn warning.

1130
01:29:36,335 --> 01:29:38,638
[Terry cries]

1131
01:29:43,910 --> 01:29:46,846
Watch out Terry, you
little piece of shit.

1132
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:51,885
[dramatic music]
[Terry crying]

1133
01:29:53,553 --> 01:29:54,353
[Cole] Hey.

1134
01:29:54,387 --> 01:29:56,890
[Terry cries]

1135
01:30:00,093 --> 01:30:01,828
You're the only chance I got.

1136
01:30:04,631 --> 01:30:07,433
Do this for me man,
please, please.

1137
01:30:07,467 --> 01:30:12,472
[dramatic music]
[Terry crying]

1138
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:26,386
Hey.

1139
01:30:26,419 --> 01:30:27,687
Hey, hey.

1140
01:30:27,720 --> 01:30:30,355
[Terry crying]

1141
01:30:41,501 --> 01:30:42,836
I'm a fucking failure, man.

1142
01:30:47,507 --> 01:30:49,943
[Cole chuckles]

1143
01:30:49,976 --> 01:30:53,046
[Terry crying]
[dramatic music]

1144
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:54,948
How much you talking?

1145
01:30:54,981 --> 01:30:58,751
Five, five grand.

1146
01:31:06,459 --> 01:31:07,627
- Where?
- Dago.

1147
01:31:10,597 --> 01:31:12,364
Nine o'clock, tomorrow night.

1148
01:31:20,540 --> 01:31:21,841
How's it supposed to go?

1149
01:31:23,509 --> 01:31:26,079
[dramatic music]

1150
01:31:28,615 --> 01:31:31,784
I met this, there's
this boy, Reggie.

1151
01:31:31,818 --> 01:31:36,789
[both chuckling]
[dramatic music]

1152
01:31:39,926 --> 01:31:41,628
You motherfucker.

1153
01:31:41,661 --> 01:31:44,163
[dramatic music]

1154
01:32:49,762 --> 01:32:51,230
[Cole] This'll get
you out of state.

1155
01:32:58,137 --> 01:33:00,006
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1156
01:33:00,039 --> 01:33:00,807
No, it wasn't.

1157
01:33:15,855 --> 01:33:16,689
You'll be okay.

1158
01:33:22,328 --> 01:33:23,162
Okay.

1159
01:33:23,196 --> 01:33:25,932
[dramatic music]

1160
01:33:58,264 --> 01:33:59,632
Game's over.

1161
01:34:01,601 --> 01:34:06,606
[country music]
[people chattering]

1162
01:34:22,389 --> 01:34:23,890
Hey fuck, man.

1163
01:34:23,923 --> 01:34:25,358
All right, here's Reggie.

1164
01:34:25,392 --> 01:34:27,160
You got the money?

1165
01:34:27,193 --> 01:34:28,828
We're gonna straighten
out a few things.

1166
01:34:28,861 --> 01:34:29,695
Damn right.

1167
01:34:29,729 --> 01:34:30,830
Terry Rose.

1168
01:34:34,033 --> 01:34:36,836
I always forget
how small you are.

1169
01:34:39,338 --> 01:34:41,274
Well hey man, great
seeing you again.

1170
01:34:41,307 --> 01:34:43,609
- What brings-
- Shut your mouth.

1171
01:34:45,111 --> 01:34:46,712
I don't know what the
fuck's going on man.

1172
01:34:46,746 --> 01:34:47,713
Hey, just be cool.

1173
01:34:49,015 --> 01:34:50,716
We're gonna handle
this right now.

1174
01:34:51,918 --> 01:34:52,952
Who the fuck is this?

1175
01:34:52,985 --> 01:34:54,153
Language, son.

1176
01:34:58,958 --> 01:35:00,193
Let's sit down, boys.

1177
01:35:01,294 --> 01:35:03,262
[Terry] I don't
wanna sit down.

1178
01:35:03,296 --> 01:35:04,163
I ain't asking.

1179
01:35:05,898 --> 01:35:06,799
[Cole] Sit down.

1180
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:10,236
Tell Everett what
you've been doing.

1181
01:35:11,804 --> 01:35:13,407
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

1182
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:15,108
I'm not messing
around with you.

1183
01:35:28,020 --> 01:35:29,956
[Terry sighs]

1184
01:35:29,989 --> 01:35:32,125
I cooked, I sold, a little.

1185
01:35:37,397 --> 01:35:39,732
Mostly I just scored
on my own stash.

1186
01:35:42,335 --> 01:35:43,703
[Everett] And here I thought

1187
01:35:43,736 --> 01:35:45,738
you were all cock and no balls.

1188
01:35:50,877 --> 01:35:51,878
I got your money.

1189
01:35:54,481 --> 01:35:57,250
And it's going to your boy
here on behalf of Everett.

1190
01:35:59,752 --> 01:36:01,220
He's gonna make the purchase.

1191
01:36:03,490 --> 01:36:06,225
And you're gonna
leave town tonight.

1192
01:36:08,928 --> 01:36:09,829
You understand me?

1193
01:36:12,298 --> 01:36:15,334
Finally, so which on of you

1194
01:36:15,368 --> 01:36:17,036
is stepping out to
the car with me?

1195
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:18,237
[Everett] That'd be me.

1196
01:36:19,238 --> 01:36:21,941
[Everett] Well let's
go make a deal, kid.

1197
01:36:21,974 --> 01:36:23,309
Hold up a goddamn minute,

1198
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:24,444
I can't just pick up
and fucking leave.

1199
01:36:24,478 --> 01:36:25,778
Terry, it's done.

1200
01:36:27,481 --> 01:36:29,715
Doc here just
purchased your freedom.

1201
01:36:31,485 --> 01:36:34,921
Can't promise what'll happen
is I leave here empty handed.

1202
01:36:34,954 --> 01:36:39,258
Well I think a
small finder's fee

1203
01:36:39,292 --> 01:36:40,226
should at least be applied.

1204
01:36:40,259 --> 01:36:42,128
Finder's fee?

1205
01:36:42,161 --> 01:36:45,031
You boys really know how to
complicate the simplest things.

1206
01:36:48,901 --> 01:36:49,735
Come on, kid.

1207
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:55,174
Fucking Cole, I
ain't town two months,

1208
01:36:55,208 --> 01:36:57,210
I damn near put on
Everett here, I did.

1209
01:37:00,547 --> 01:37:02,348
Is that what you think.

1210
01:37:02,382 --> 01:37:05,084
It's what I fucking know.

1211
01:37:05,117 --> 01:37:07,253
You've just been a pest.

1212
01:37:07,286 --> 01:37:09,755
Like crabs on a
dick, nothing more.

1213
01:37:09,789 --> 01:37:11,257
Terry, sit the fuck down.

1214
01:37:11,290 --> 01:37:13,393
Listen ladies, y'all
can kiss and make up

1215
01:37:13,427 --> 01:37:16,162
after I'm gone, but let's
do this shit already.

1216
01:37:16,195 --> 01:37:17,930
Watch your mouth, stranger.

1217
01:37:17,964 --> 01:37:19,399
Get the fuck out of my face.

1218
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,501
You just lost all
value to me, punk!

1219
01:37:21,535 --> 01:37:24,270
Everett, he's a kid,
he's a kid, Everett.

1220
01:37:24,303 --> 01:37:27,173
[Officer] Get your
hands up and turn around!

1221
01:37:27,206 --> 01:37:28,074
This is on you!

1222
01:37:28,107 --> 01:37:28,908
No, no, no!

1223
01:37:28,941 --> 01:37:29,976
[gun fires]

1224
01:37:30,009 --> 01:37:32,278
[Officer] Hands up, hands up!

1225
01:37:34,046 --> 01:37:38,050
Drop to your knees,
lay flat, lay flat.

1226
01:37:38,084 --> 01:37:43,089
[dramatic music]
[all shouting]

1227
01:38:20,627 --> 01:38:22,895
Shit, is that one dead?

1228
01:38:22,928 --> 01:38:27,933
[Officer] God knows, some
local, Gary, or Jerry something.

1229
01:38:30,336 --> 01:38:32,171
[Man] This ones down.

1230
01:38:32,204 --> 01:38:37,209
[dramatic music]
[people chattering]

1231
01:38:40,647 --> 01:38:42,148
We got him, boys.

1232
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:46,852
[dramatic music]
[people chattering]

1233
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:54,428
[sighing]

1234
01:38:58,898 --> 01:39:00,166
You all right?

1235
01:39:00,199 --> 01:39:03,369
Nobody was
supposed to get hurt.

1236
01:39:03,403 --> 01:39:05,237
We did our best, Cole.

1237
01:39:05,271 --> 01:39:08,040
[dramatic music]

1238
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:47,306
I didn't know what you liked

1239
01:40:47,339 --> 01:40:50,309
so I just made what I know how.

1240
01:40:53,613 --> 01:40:55,347
I'll get you a
little more bacon.

1241
01:40:59,218 --> 01:41:00,085
All right.

1242
01:41:31,116 --> 01:41:32,351
You curious about your daddy?

1243
01:41:34,454 --> 01:41:35,622
Mama ever tell you anything?

1244
01:41:38,758 --> 01:41:40,326
Did you know him?

1245
01:41:40,359 --> 01:41:42,328
Of course I knew him.

1246
01:41:44,063 --> 01:41:48,067
Last I heard he was in South
Carolina, John Milligan.

1247
01:41:51,771 --> 01:41:53,138
- All right.
- Okay.

1248
01:42:04,684 --> 01:42:06,720
I'm sorry, I'm just
not that hungry is all.

1249
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:08,822
Nah, no, it tastes like shit.

1250
01:42:08,855 --> 01:42:11,625
[both chuckling]

1251
01:42:26,205 --> 01:42:28,274
[Cole] I gotta go talk
to grandma for a bit.

1252
01:42:28,307 --> 01:42:29,141
Yeah.

1253
01:42:31,878 --> 01:42:33,345
Oh, just a minute though.

1254
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:41,320
For kindling, or
you know, whatever.

1255
01:42:41,353 --> 01:42:42,656
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

1256
01:42:46,726 --> 01:42:47,561
Please write.

1257
01:42:50,162 --> 01:42:52,331
- I will.
- More than I did, okay?

1258
01:42:55,502 --> 01:42:56,469
Where should I send them?

1259
01:42:56,503 --> 01:42:57,336
Right here.

1260
01:42:59,138 --> 01:42:59,773
Here's fine.

1261
01:43:10,717 --> 01:43:15,722
He asked for you, you know,
you were the one he wanted.

1262
01:43:21,394 --> 01:43:23,362
Maybe he was asking forgiveness.

1263
01:43:41,347 --> 01:43:44,316
[light banjo music]

1264
