1
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:19,036
<i>Please come closer.</i>

2
00:01:19,128 --> 00:01:20,880
<i>Have a seat.</i>

3
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:33,680
<i>Tell me, what makes you think you</i>
<i>are so qualified for this assignment?</i>

4
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:37,920
My previous occupation
was captain of the Galactic Alliance.

5
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:42,798
But after my last mission,
I was retired.

6
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:46,005
<i>You let Experiment 626 escape.</i>

7
00:01:46,088 --> 00:01:48,158
It wasn't my fault.
The little trog...

8
00:01:48,248 --> 00:01:49,681
<i>Calm down.</i>

9
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:54,717
<i>This job has absolutely nothing</i>
<i>to do with 626.</i>

10
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:56,878
I know what the job is about.

11
00:01:56,968 --> 00:02:01,598
And I believe I know the location
of the item you seek.

12
00:02:01,688 --> 00:02:02,962
<i>Where is it?</i>

13
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:05,482
A tiny planet in Gamma Quadrant.

14
00:02:05,568 --> 00:02:08,446
They call it Earth.

15
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:47,960
Let's go!

16
00:02:50,848 --> 00:02:52,042
Nani.

17
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,039
You need some help?

18
00:02:54,128 --> 00:02:56,039
Let me give you a hand.

19
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,596
- Where's Lilo?
- She's not with you?

20
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,642
Look! A parking space.

21
00:03:05,808 --> 00:03:07,526
Ridiculous Earth vehicle.

22
00:03:07,608 --> 00:03:09,166
Needs evil-genius tune-up.

23
00:03:09,248 --> 00:03:10,920
I am thrilled.

24
00:03:11,008 --> 00:03:13,238
My very first day at an Earth beach.

25
00:03:13,328 --> 00:03:17,799
I've been studying
mingling with locals. Hang loose.

26
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:20,920
Whatever.

27
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:25,126
Are you sure your one-piece
bathing suit is from proper century?

28
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,846
Absolutely.

29
00:03:26,928 --> 00:03:28,725
Put on your hat.

30
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:30,605
Have you two seen Lilo?

31
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:33,202
We thought little girl was with you.

32
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:37,600
Today, you take your rightful place
as part of the Hawaiian community.

33
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:38,962
Are you ready?

34
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,047
How's that?

35
00:03:41,128 --> 00:03:43,244
Nice skirt.

36
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,319
But you don't need to dress up.

37
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:46,636
Just be yourself.

38
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,243
Hi.

39
00:03:51,048 --> 00:03:54,040
Maybe not that much yourself.

40
00:03:54,128 --> 00:03:58,644
Now, remember, in Hawaii,
everybody calls each other cousin.

41
00:03:58,728 --> 00:04:00,958
Not because we're all related,

42
00:04:01,048 --> 00:04:03,437
but because we're one big <i>ohana.</i>

43
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:05,519
One happy family.

44
00:04:07,208 --> 00:04:11,440
It'll be fine.
Just say, "<i>Aloha,</i> cousin."

45
00:04:13,688 --> 00:04:15,280
Go on.

46
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:20,999
<i>Aloha,</i> cousin.

47
00:04:24,808 --> 00:04:26,639
I got it!

48
00:04:33,568 --> 00:04:35,365
<i>Aloha,</i> cousin.

49
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:37,527
Smells good.

50
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,883
Who wants to slice the pineapple?

51
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:51,041
Oh, no.

52
00:04:51,128 --> 00:04:52,402
Not good.

53
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:54,558
That's my chain saw.

54
00:05:00,408 --> 00:05:03,559
That blue dude, he's totally freaky.

55
00:05:03,648 --> 00:05:06,640
I told Lilo no pets.

56
00:05:29,368 --> 00:05:30,847
Hi.

57
00:05:31,608 --> 00:05:32,927
Hi.

58
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,800
Hello.

59
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:41,283
I brought ice cream.

60
00:05:44,168 --> 00:05:46,045
It wasn't that bad.

61
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:49,040
After you left,
I got to help put out the fire.

62
00:05:50,248 --> 00:05:51,920
No cousins.

63
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:54,806
You're a part of our <i>ohana</i> now.

64
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:58,005
But getting everybody else
to like you is harder.

65
00:05:58,088 --> 00:06:01,080
Trust me. I know.

66
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:05,085
- I'm freaky.
- You're different.

67
00:06:05,168 --> 00:06:09,047
You're one of a kind,
like Frankenstein.

68
00:06:12,968 --> 00:06:15,687
Sure you can watch Lilo
for a couple of hours?

69
00:06:15,768 --> 00:06:17,884
You two go. Have a good time.

70
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:21,483
Everything here
is completely under control.

71
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:26,040
I'm even fixing
my very first Earth dinner.

72
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:27,846
You're fixing dog food.

73
00:06:27,928 --> 00:06:31,204
I know. It makes its own gravy.

74
00:06:32,728 --> 00:06:35,037
Here. Why don't you take this?

75
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:39,758
- Leafy greens?
- No. It's money. For pizza.

76
00:06:39,848 --> 00:06:44,160
- They deliver.
- Really? Fascinating.

77
00:06:44,248 --> 00:06:46,716
Don't worry. They'll be fine.

78
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,322
Yeah. I guess they're OK.

79
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:51,763
But I think
Pleakley tries on my clothes.

80
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,564
"Insert tab A into chromosome B."

81
00:07:06,648 --> 00:07:09,116
- Jumba?
- Spies!

82
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:13,201
626. What do you want?
I'm busy doing genius work.

83
00:07:16,168 --> 00:07:19,285
No cousins? Well, of course not.

84
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:21,598
We are each one of a kind, you and I.

85
00:07:21,688 --> 00:07:25,647
Evil genius scientist
and evil genius creation,

86
00:07:25,728 --> 00:07:28,606
all alone in infinite universe.

87
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:31,282
You have maybe found
tiny adopted Earth family,

88
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,407
but we have no, as you say, cousins.

89
00:07:39,248 --> 00:07:40,237
What is this?

90
00:07:43,528 --> 00:07:46,406
Must be the pizza. I'll get it!

91
00:07:53,448 --> 00:07:55,404
Gantu!

92
00:07:59,528 --> 00:08:01,200
He's come back for Stitch.

93
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:04,760
Hurry! We can sneak out the back.

94
00:08:04,848 --> 00:08:08,045
- Jumba, where are you going?
- I have to take care of things.

95
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:10,522
What is that?

96
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,279
What is what?

97
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:17,485
You can't have Stitch, you big dummy.

98
00:08:18,688 --> 00:08:24,001
I'm not fat, and I'm not here
for the failed Experiment 626.

99
00:08:25,328 --> 00:08:27,967
- Stitch!
- Where's Jumba?

100
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,084
- Take this and hide.
- No!

101
00:08:30,168 --> 00:08:32,363
This is something evil and bad.

102
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,006
- Take it.
- No.

103
00:08:34,088 --> 00:08:35,077
- Take it.
- Evil.

104
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,317
- Take it.
- No!

105
00:08:36,408 --> 00:08:38,205
- Take it.
- Bad. No!

106
00:08:38,288 --> 00:08:40,165
- Take it.
- Evil. No!

107
00:08:40,248 --> 00:08:41,317
- Take it.
- Bad.

108
00:08:45,688 --> 00:08:47,360
Very funny.

109
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:50,201
Not to make a peep,
my little one-eyed one,

110
00:08:50,288 --> 00:08:52,358
or entire galaxy is doomed.

111
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:54,757
How am I supposed to breathe?

112
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:59,240
Jumba Jookiba.

113
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:01,444
Gantu. No see long time.

114
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:04,486
- Where are they?
- They? Who they?

115
00:09:04,568 --> 00:09:07,082
The other 625 experiments.

116
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:11,446
You must have me confused
with other evil-genius scientist.

117
00:09:11,528 --> 00:09:13,484
What have we here?

118
00:09:14,248 --> 00:09:16,716
Is ping-pong ball.

119
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:20,357
Is Earth sport.
Like tennis, but tinier.

120
00:09:20,448 --> 00:09:24,407
You're a bad liar, Jumba.
Where are the other experiment pods?

121
00:09:24,488 --> 00:09:28,037
I never discuss scientific research
with big dummies.

122
00:09:28,128 --> 00:09:32,280
Then perhaps you'll discuss it with
your former partner, Dr Hämsterviel.

123
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:35,007
Hämsterviel is alive?

124
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:37,841
And he wants his experiments back.

125
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:43,681
Jumba? Help.

126
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,158
He's taking Jumba!

127
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:08,163
No!

128
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:16,724
Jumba!

129
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:23,048
What are we gonna do?

130
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:25,841
Where are you going?

131
00:10:28,488 --> 00:10:29,637
Wait up!

132
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,317
Jumba and Pleakley's ship.

133
00:10:38,688 --> 00:10:40,246
Don't we need the keys?

134
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:02,600
Thanks for the...
Well, I guess it was a date.

135
00:11:02,688 --> 00:11:05,043
- Was it?
- We split the bill.

136
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:06,925
Yeah, but I paid the tip.

137
00:11:07,528 --> 00:11:10,520
David,
I'm not ready for a real date yet.

138
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:13,600
Things are still
kind of <i>lolo</i> around here.

139
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:17,237
- Come on. How bad can it be?
- Oh, no.

140
00:11:22,528 --> 00:11:23,802
Lilo?

141
00:11:26,368 --> 00:11:27,437
Anybody here?

142
00:11:29,928 --> 00:11:31,327
No sign of her.

143
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,000
Or Stitch. Or those other two.

144
00:11:33,088 --> 00:11:35,079
Stay here
in case anybody comes back.

145
00:11:35,168 --> 00:11:36,920
I'll go into town to look.

146
00:11:37,008 --> 00:11:40,921
I'm sure it's OK. She's probably
hanging out with her new friends.

147
00:11:46,968 --> 00:11:49,357
- Do it again.
- Jumba.

148
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:58,566
Computer,
lock hyperdrive coordinates...

149
00:12:07,368 --> 00:12:10,644
626, please to be sharper
with the shooting.

150
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,438
Right up his afterburner!

151
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:19,441
- Damage?
- <i>Engine one, 75 percent capacity.</i>

152
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:21,766
<i>50 percent capacity.</i>

153
00:12:24,088 --> 00:12:26,556
You had coffee today, didn't you?

154
00:12:26,648 --> 00:12:28,559
Coconut cake and coffee.

155
00:12:28,648 --> 00:12:30,445
Activate boosters.

156
00:12:32,088 --> 00:12:33,840
That way!

157
00:12:35,128 --> 00:12:38,006
Reroute engine power to rear.
Lock on target.

158
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,879
- <i>Target locked.</i>
- Fire.

159
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,087
Good steering.

160
00:12:58,808 --> 00:13:00,878
We're losing all our power!

161
00:13:00,968 --> 00:13:02,720
My turn this time.

162
00:13:03,248 --> 00:13:05,204
<i>Hyperdrive activated.</i>

163
00:13:08,808 --> 00:13:10,844
Jumba?

164
00:13:37,888 --> 00:13:40,482
I think we're out of gas.

165
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:44,636
<i>This is an emergency announcement.</i>

166
00:13:44,728 --> 00:13:47,003
<i>Aliens from outer space</i>
<i>have invaded Earth</i>

167
00:13:47,088 --> 00:13:51,445
<i>and are kidnapping our most brilliant</i>
<i>scientists for unknown purposes.</i>

168
00:13:51,528 --> 00:13:52,722
Lilo.

169
00:13:52,808 --> 00:13:54,685
I knew you were OK.

170
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,963
You're missing our favourite movie.

171
00:14:00,488 --> 00:14:03,366
Does Nani know
I was out past my bedtime?

172
00:14:03,448 --> 00:14:05,598
Yeah. She's out looking for you.

173
00:14:06,968 --> 00:14:09,402
Jumba was kidnapped by Gantu.

174
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:11,558
- The big dummy?
- Yep.

175
00:14:11,648 --> 00:14:14,287
You and Stitch can handle him.

176
00:14:14,368 --> 00:14:16,962
Where did Stitch go?

177
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:21,440
Stitch?

178
00:14:29,648 --> 00:14:31,127
Pleakley.

179
00:14:33,648 --> 00:14:37,323
Gosh. Oh, my.
Breathing first, talking second.

180
00:14:40,008 --> 00:14:43,762
I'm ready now.
Jumba! Gantu kidnapped Jumba!

181
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:46,965
- I know.
- He was after this.

182
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,200
<i>Container ready. Select experiment.</i>

183
00:14:59,288 --> 00:15:01,040
What is it?

184
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,403
It's some of Jumba's evil science.

185
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:16,965
Look at that.

186
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,687
It's more illegal
genetic experiments.

187
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:22,282
You mean
there are more besides Stitch?

188
00:15:22,368 --> 00:15:24,438
Well, Stitch is number 626.

189
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:27,759
These must be the other 625.

190
00:15:27,848 --> 00:15:29,440
They don't look like him.

191
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:32,520
They've obviously
been dehydrated for transport.

192
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,041
How do they work?

193
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:36,198
Well, I'm no evil genius,

194
00:15:36,288 --> 00:15:38,927
but I'd say
if any of these pods get wet,

195
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:43,798
they would rehydrate into one of
the 625 prototype Stitch experiments.

196
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:47,278
Each with its own unique
and highly destructive capability.

197
00:15:47,368 --> 00:15:48,721
But I'm just guessing.

198
00:15:48,808 --> 00:15:52,164
With more Stitches,
I bet we could rescue Jumba.

199
00:15:52,248 --> 00:15:54,967
We could activate one
and go back into space...

200
00:15:55,048 --> 00:15:57,004
Hold it! Hold everything.

201
00:15:57,088 --> 00:16:00,637
These experiments are highly unstable
and very dangerous.

202
00:16:00,728 --> 00:16:03,686
We're gonna keep these locked up...

203
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:07,759
...safe and dry.

204
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:13,083
And as for you two,
you must never, repeat, never,

205
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:14,487
open that container.

206
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:16,240
If those pods got wet,

207
00:16:16,328 --> 00:16:19,718
it could create mass mayhem
and planet-wide panic.

208
00:16:19,808 --> 00:16:21,560
- Got it?
- Got it.

209
00:16:29,008 --> 00:16:31,920
David, I looked everywhere.
Have you heard anything?

210
00:16:32,008 --> 00:16:34,647
They're fine.
They're playing upstairs.

211
00:16:34,728 --> 00:16:36,923
I'm gonna get you a cellphone.

212
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:39,367
Lilo!

213
00:16:39,448 --> 00:16:41,439
Thank goodness you're OK.

214
00:16:42,408 --> 00:16:44,797
Stop it! You're hugging me to death.

215
00:16:44,888 --> 00:16:47,686
Where were you? What happened?

216
00:16:47,768 --> 00:16:51,556
Well, Captain Gantu came back
and kidnapped Jumba.

217
00:16:51,648 --> 00:16:55,436
Me and Stitch hot-wired the spaceship
and chased him into outer space,

218
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:57,086
which was really cool.

219
00:16:57,168 --> 00:16:58,647
- But then...
- Wait.

220
00:16:58,728 --> 00:17:02,880
While David and I went to dinner,
you went to outer space?

221
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,480
- I'm not finished.
- Sorry.

222
00:17:06,568 --> 00:17:09,799
So Gantu got away
and we ran out of power.

223
00:17:09,888 --> 00:17:11,685
And then Stitch saved the ship,

224
00:17:11,768 --> 00:17:15,807
and then we came home, and then
you came home and tried to hug me.

225
00:17:15,888 --> 00:17:18,322
Now I'm finished.

226
00:17:18,408 --> 00:17:21,241
I thought you said
I had nothing to worry about.

227
00:17:21,328 --> 00:17:22,966
I was locked in a footlocker.

228
00:17:23,048 --> 00:17:25,278
Why are you wearing
my favourite T-shirt?

229
00:17:25,368 --> 00:17:26,960
It's not even your colour.

230
00:17:27,048 --> 00:17:29,118
What are we gonna do about Jumba?

231
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:30,960
What am I, an astronaut?

232
00:17:31,048 --> 00:17:33,278
He was abducted by aliens.

233
00:17:33,368 --> 00:17:36,041
But we can't just forget about him.

234
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:38,562
He's part of our <i>ohana.</i>

235
00:17:42,248 --> 00:17:45,763
I know it's late,
but I need to talk to Cobra Bubbles.

236
00:17:45,848 --> 00:17:48,408
- It's an emergency.
- <i>He</i>'<i>s asleep right now.</i>

237
00:17:48,488 --> 00:17:49,921
So wake him up.

238
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:52,158
I'm going to make a few calls myself,

239
00:17:52,248 --> 00:17:55,445
using my trusty
Intergalactic Periwinkle Pages.

240
00:17:55,528 --> 00:17:58,486
There's only so many phones
in the galaxy.

241
00:18:06,328 --> 00:18:09,240
Hello? Planet Aaaaaaaaa?

242
00:18:09,328 --> 00:18:11,603
- Is Jumba there?
- <i>You know what time it is?</i>

243
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:13,519
You don't have to be rude.

244
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:17,442
I bet one of those
other experiments could help us.

245
00:18:17,528 --> 00:18:20,600
Too bad Pleakley said not to open it.

246
00:18:37,728 --> 00:18:40,720
Pleakley also said
not to get them wet.

247
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:52,598
Hello? Planet Aaaaaaaaa?

248
00:18:52,688 --> 00:18:54,804
- Is Jumba there?
- <i>Go jump in a lake!</i>

249
00:18:54,888 --> 00:18:56,241
Same to you, fella.

250
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:01,279
Wait! We don't need all of them!

251
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:04,681
Just look for one
that can recharge the ship.

252
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,677
<i>Container ready.</i>

253
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,200
<i>Select experiment.</i>

254
00:19:20,688 --> 00:19:22,519
<i>Experiment 221.</i>

255
00:19:23,248 --> 00:19:26,046
<i>Primary function,</i>
<i>electrical power surge.</i>

256
00:19:36,688 --> 00:19:38,838
<i>Experiment 221 activated.</i>

257
00:19:58,408 --> 00:20:00,444
- Come on!
- What's going on?

258
00:20:00,528 --> 00:20:01,847
Dark. Very dark.

259
00:20:16,088 --> 00:20:18,124
Cousin lost.

260
00:20:18,208 --> 00:20:20,119
Jumba lost.

261
00:20:20,208 --> 00:20:23,086
You have a lot of lost issues.

262
00:20:26,448 --> 00:20:29,838
But if we can find 221,
we can find Jumba.

263
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,396
Come on. I'll get a flashlight.

264
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:52,446
Prepare yourself for cruel
and interminable torture.

265
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm not afraid of torture.

266
00:20:55,608 --> 00:20:57,405
Excepting maybe little bit.

267
00:20:57,488 --> 00:21:01,367
I'm certain Dr Hämsterviel
will find your little bit.

268
00:21:12,368 --> 00:21:14,677
Gantu, you're late.

269
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,724
Dr Jacques Von Hamster-wheel.

270
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:20,368
Hämsterviel! It is Hämsterviel!

271
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,804
You stole my evil genius experiment,
Jumba.

272
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:26,527
Perhaps,
since you paid for experiments,

273
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:29,725
the evil is yours,
but genius was all mine.

274
00:21:29,808 --> 00:21:32,197
What? Come down here and say that!

275
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,643
Funny,
you are shorter than I remember,

276
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:37,083
but you still have twitchy nose
like gerbil.

277
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:40,524
I am not gerbil-like,
I am hamster-like,

278
00:21:40,608 --> 00:21:43,918
you with your four eyes
and inexplicable accent.

279
00:21:44,688 --> 00:21:47,885
Anyway, I did find
this one experiment pod.

280
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:50,436
Jumba refused to reveal
the others' location,

281
00:21:50,528 --> 00:21:53,201
- so I brought him for interrogation.
- Only one?

282
00:21:53,288 --> 00:21:55,882
You incompetent fish head
of a minion!

283
00:21:55,968 --> 00:21:58,084
I kick your stinky oversized feet!

284
00:21:59,968 --> 00:22:01,959
Wait. What?

285
00:22:02,048 --> 00:22:04,164
Interrogation?

286
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:08,002
Alright, take this! And that!

287
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:11,046
Don't just stand there.
Bring me a phone book.

288
00:22:25,128 --> 00:22:26,959
It couldn't have gone too far.

289
00:22:31,288 --> 00:22:32,357
Quiet!

290
00:23:02,088 --> 00:23:04,079
Maybe he went this way.

291
00:23:11,968 --> 00:23:15,961
If you do not tell me where
the other experiments can be found,

292
00:23:16,048 --> 00:23:19,404
I will begin with the threatening.

293
00:23:19,488 --> 00:23:21,604
Your threatenings don't threaten me.

294
00:23:21,688 --> 00:23:23,485
Then I will threaten your family.

295
00:23:24,288 --> 00:23:26,358
I have no family!

296
00:23:26,448 --> 00:23:30,157
Perhaps I will activate
the one experiment pod

297
00:23:30,248 --> 00:23:32,398
and leave you to its tortures.

298
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:37,642
Experiment 625.
He has all powers the same as 626.

299
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:42,848
He'll torture your little doughboy
buddy into talking.

300
00:23:42,928 --> 00:23:44,998
Activate the experiment.

301
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:09,840
Run!

302
00:24:18,448 --> 00:24:22,327
Any second now, you'll hear
his tortured cries of regret.

303
00:24:22,808 --> 00:24:26,198
"Please let me out!
I'll tell you everything!"

304
00:24:26,288 --> 00:24:28,085
Any second now,

305
00:24:28,168 --> 00:24:32,400
his pathetic screaming,
begging for mercy.

306
00:24:32,488 --> 00:24:38,279
Any second.
Should be right about now!

307
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,682
- I don't hear anything.
- Shut up. I can't hear.

308
00:24:47,608 --> 00:24:51,317
So, you see,
625 has all powers of 626.

309
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,842
Even has
advanced language program.

310
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:57,125
Unfortunately is also lazy coward.

311
00:24:57,208 --> 00:24:58,880
But makes great sandwiches.

312
00:24:58,968 --> 00:25:00,481
Ham or tuna?

313
00:25:02,728 --> 00:25:04,605
<i>I am irked!</i>

314
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,527
It's on the other side of the fence.

315
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:26,037
Lilo, what are you doing here?

316
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:27,800
You're having a camp-out?

317
00:25:27,888 --> 00:25:31,085
But you told me everyone was sick.

318
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:33,887
We are sick. Sick of you.

319
00:25:33,968 --> 00:25:35,321
Yeah!

320
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:39,481
Well, who needs
your dumb fakey camp-out anyway?

321
00:25:39,568 --> 00:25:43,163
We're looking for a genetic
experiment from another galaxy

322
00:25:43,248 --> 00:25:46,843
so we can recharge a spaceship
and rescue Jumba from aliens.

323
00:25:48,248 --> 00:25:51,081
- You're a liar.
- No, I'm not.

324
00:25:51,168 --> 00:25:53,636
It's in your yard. Right over there.

325
00:25:58,288 --> 00:26:01,325
That's a bug electrocutor,
not an alien.

326
00:26:01,408 --> 00:26:05,117
You and your disconfigured dog
are total freaks.

327
00:26:05,208 --> 00:26:06,846
Yeah!

328
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:12,280
You can spit acid on 'em
if you want to.

329
00:26:19,288 --> 00:26:21,597
Come on, Stitch.

330
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:42,638
Don't let Nani hear us.

331
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:45,606
It's so past my bedtime.

332
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:49,203
Lilo! It is so past your bedtime.

333
00:26:58,328 --> 00:27:01,081
And don't forget to brush your teeth.

334
00:27:06,168 --> 00:27:08,762
One more call before bed.

335
00:27:21,408 --> 00:27:22,397
Phone.

336
00:27:23,928 --> 00:27:26,567
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Is Jumba there?

337
00:27:26,648 --> 00:27:28,479
<i>This is him speaking.</i>

338
00:27:28,568 --> 00:27:29,444
Jumba!

339
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,523
It's Jumba!

340
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:34,725
Pleakley, how did you get number
for Gantu's detention cell?

341
00:27:34,808 --> 00:27:37,003
I just called the number listed here.

342
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,567
Detention cell phone.

343
00:27:39,608 --> 00:27:42,202
Cellphone! I get it.

344
00:27:42,808 --> 00:27:47,404
There must be some way to make
that morally bankrupt scientist talk.

345
00:27:47,488 --> 00:27:49,718
I think I'm gonna make a sandwich.

346
00:27:49,808 --> 00:27:51,446
Gantu, how about a sandwich?

347
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:53,484
I don't want a sandwich!

348
00:27:53,568 --> 00:27:56,082
You sure? Last of the baloney.

349
00:27:56,168 --> 00:27:58,523
I don't like baloney.

350
00:27:58,608 --> 00:28:00,405
Too fatty.

351
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:03,400
<i>Unauthorised communication</i>
<i>intercepted.</i>

352
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:04,716
<i>Detention cell two.</i>

353
00:28:06,328 --> 00:28:08,364
So then monkey says to rabbi...

354
00:28:08,448 --> 00:28:12,600
- What's going on here?
- Excuse me. Interrupting punch line.

355
00:28:12,688 --> 00:28:14,758
- Sorry.
- Stop apologising!

356
00:28:14,848 --> 00:28:16,759
Sorry.

357
00:28:16,848 --> 00:28:17,837
Give me that!

358
00:28:17,928 --> 00:28:21,000
Listen to me,
you caller of Jumba, you.

359
00:28:21,088 --> 00:28:23,397
Yes.

360
00:28:23,488 --> 00:28:25,046
It's the kidnapper.

361
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:26,527
OK.

362
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,639
Good. Fine.

363
00:28:29,728 --> 00:28:31,207
What's he saying?

364
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:34,758
He wants all 624 other experiments
as a ransom,

365
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:37,646
or we'll never see Jumba alive.

366
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,764
Wait for my phone call.

367
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:42,442
I will then tell you
the ransom exchange location

368
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:45,645
and call you many nasty names.

369
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:47,081
Hang that up.

370
00:28:48,368 --> 00:28:51,087
- No, slam it.
- Sorry.

371
00:28:53,808 --> 00:28:55,878
What are we gonna do?

372
00:29:13,648 --> 00:29:14,842
You called?

373
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:16,680
Cobra. How are you?

374
00:29:16,768 --> 00:29:19,646
- Sleepy.
- Sorry.

375
00:29:19,728 --> 00:29:24,563
Cobra. Thank goodness. It's terrible.
Just terrible. Jumba's been...

376
00:29:24,648 --> 00:29:26,047
- Kidnapped.
- Yes. By...

377
00:29:26,128 --> 00:29:27,243
Dr Hämsterviel.

378
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,841
- He wants a...
- Ransom.

379
00:29:28,928 --> 00:29:31,123
- Of...
- The other experiments.

380
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:32,766
You're good.

381
00:29:35,248 --> 00:29:36,840
How do you know all that?

382
00:29:36,928 --> 00:29:40,443
Information is power,
and I like power.

383
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:43,565
- What should we do?
- Wait for Hämsterviel's next call.

384
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:45,604
Once we have
the rendezvous location,

385
00:29:45,688 --> 00:29:48,282
we will exchange the experiments
for Jumba.

386
00:29:48,368 --> 00:29:51,007
From there we follow
the governmental procedure.

387
00:29:51,088 --> 00:29:53,158
What's the governmental procedure?

388
00:29:57,568 --> 00:29:59,718
Classified. Right.

389
00:29:59,808 --> 00:30:02,117
This is now
an intergalactic incident.

390
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,883
Take no further action
other than what I have indicated.

391
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:08,357
Is that clear, Lilo?

392
00:30:08,448 --> 00:30:09,597
Yeah.

393
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:12,361
Me and Stitch
are gonna go out and play,

394
00:30:12,448 --> 00:30:14,757
and not take further action.

395
00:30:16,128 --> 00:30:17,880
No action.

396
00:30:17,968 --> 00:30:20,801
That kidnapper
wants all the experiments.

397
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:25,643
We've got to find the sparky little
electrical one we lost, or no Jumba.

398
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:29,687
We've got to search
the entire island.

399
00:30:30,488 --> 00:30:31,477
Stitch?

400
00:32:04,648 --> 00:32:07,879
What's that? Look out!

401
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:11,121
I'm thinking he's this way.

402
00:32:14,648 --> 00:32:16,047
This looks promising.

403
00:32:25,648 --> 00:32:28,924
Don't lose him!
I'll find something to catch him in.

404
00:32:49,048 --> 00:32:50,242
Grab him, Stitch!

405
00:33:00,008 --> 00:33:01,566
Got him!

406
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:10,003
Isn't he cute? He's got your smile.

407
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,047
Cousin!

408
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,719
I've been working on your chart.

409
00:33:46,808 --> 00:33:50,596
As you can see, it's not nearly
as bad as Stitch's was.

410
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:55,244
Too bad we have to give you away.

411
00:33:55,328 --> 00:33:57,205
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

412
00:33:57,288 --> 00:33:59,199
We gotta get Jumba back.

413
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,677
Cousin. <i>Ohana.</i>

414
00:34:05,968 --> 00:34:08,436
You know what? You're right.

415
00:34:08,528 --> 00:34:13,044
It's like I said.
You're all one big happy family.

416
00:34:14,008 --> 00:34:17,080
It's the call. I'll get it.

417
00:34:20,848 --> 00:34:24,397
Be calm. Get the rendezvous
information, then hang up.

418
00:34:24,488 --> 00:34:26,956
Calm. Rendezvous. Hang up.

419
00:34:27,048 --> 00:34:28,163
Here I go.

420
00:34:28,248 --> 00:34:31,046
- Hello?
- <i>Hello, Mr Pleakley.</i>

421
00:34:31,128 --> 00:34:34,962
<i>This is the New You Girdle Company</i>
<i>calling regarding your order.</i>

422
00:34:35,048 --> 00:34:36,367
Wrong number.

423
00:34:36,448 --> 00:34:39,121
Girdle? I wouldn't need a girdle
for my disguise.

424
00:34:39,208 --> 00:34:42,325
It's an undergarment.
Why would I use a girdle?

425
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:45,325
- I didn't order anything!
- <i>What?</i>

426
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:47,285
Hello. How are you?

427
00:34:47,368 --> 00:34:50,565
- It's Hamster-wheel.
- <i>Hämsterviel! Hämsterviel!</i>

428
00:34:51,528 --> 00:34:54,281
The lighthouse in ten minutes,
and don't be late.

429
00:34:57,728 --> 00:35:00,288
This is an unfortunate complication.

430
00:35:00,368 --> 00:35:03,166
I know. We can take
the ridiculous Earth vehicle.

431
00:35:10,328 --> 00:35:11,920
Where's Pleakley and Cobra?

432
00:35:12,008 --> 00:35:13,839
They went to get Jumba back.

433
00:35:13,928 --> 00:35:15,884
- But...
- I've got to go to work.

434
00:35:15,968 --> 00:35:18,084
- But...
- No more buts!

435
00:35:18,168 --> 00:35:19,840
Just stay here.

436
00:35:44,128 --> 00:35:47,165
What a stunning example
of architecture!

437
00:35:47,248 --> 00:35:49,887
Why isn't the big light
spinning around?

438
00:35:49,968 --> 00:35:53,404
The beacon hasn't been lit for years.
Too costly.

439
00:36:05,648 --> 00:36:07,957
Hämsterviel should be here by now.

440
00:36:28,128 --> 00:36:31,803
That's Hamster-wheel? He sounded
much bigger on the phone.

441
00:36:31,888 --> 00:36:35,403
Stop talking about me,
you gossiping pea-brains!

442
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:38,161
- Do you have the ransom?
- Do you have Jumba?

443
00:36:38,248 --> 00:36:40,045
That's my question to you, sir.

444
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:43,404
Bring out the four-eyed fathead.

445
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:47,958
Jumba! You're OK.

446
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:49,879
Enough with your teary reunion.

447
00:36:49,968 --> 00:36:51,720
Give me the experiments.

448
00:37:02,088 --> 00:37:05,000
<i>623 experiments</i>
<i>logged and functional.</i>

449
00:37:05,088 --> 00:37:07,283
623?

450
00:37:07,368 --> 00:37:08,926
There's one missing!

451
00:37:09,008 --> 00:37:10,919
Code yellow. Delay movement.

452
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:14,125
My ransom demand
was for all the experiments.

453
00:37:14,208 --> 00:37:17,006
You're trying to pull a sneaky thing.

454
00:37:17,808 --> 00:37:21,084
What is one tiny experiment
between old partners?

455
00:37:21,168 --> 00:37:23,728
Quiet! I am blaming you for this.

456
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:26,766
- Dispose of him.
- Gladly.

457
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:28,964
No! He's allergic to plasma blasts!

458
00:37:29,048 --> 00:37:30,925
Listen to him. It's true.

459
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,078
Wait!

460
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:37,237
I've got the missing experiment.

461
00:37:37,328 --> 00:37:39,159
What? Who is this?

462
00:37:39,248 --> 00:37:42,684
A little Earth girl who can be
a gigantic pain in the rear.

463
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:44,520
Well done, Lilo.

464
00:37:44,608 --> 00:37:47,486
Give it to the diminutive
gerbil-like creature.

465
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:51,481
Hamster-like. Not gerbil. Hamster!

466
00:37:51,568 --> 00:37:53,160
- Give it to me!
- No.

467
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:55,398
It's the only way you can save Jumba.

468
00:37:55,488 --> 00:37:58,048
But I've gotta save Sparky, too.

469
00:37:58,128 --> 00:37:59,561
You've named it?

470
00:37:59,648 --> 00:38:03,357
Yep. We're gonna name
all the experiments.

471
00:38:05,488 --> 00:38:08,366
Shut up
with all your not shutting up!

472
00:38:08,448 --> 00:38:09,437
Hand it over!

473
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:10,927
Nope.

474
00:38:11,008 --> 00:38:12,885
Lilo, do what he says.

475
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:14,720
Whose side are you on?

476
00:38:14,808 --> 00:38:17,197
He's on saving-my-life side.
Is good side.

477
00:38:17,288 --> 00:38:20,325
You fail to comprehend
the complexity of the situation.

478
00:38:20,408 --> 00:38:23,286
Do you want your Jumba or not?

479
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:28,161
Make your choice, little girl.

480
00:38:42,088 --> 00:38:44,727
OK. I've decided.

481
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:47,242
You can't have either of 'em.

482
00:38:47,328 --> 00:38:49,717
Be free, little cousin.

483
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:55,648
- Now you save Jumba.
- Jumba!

484
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:58,367
- Begin the shooting.
- Finally!

485
00:39:06,648 --> 00:39:09,287
Stay calm.
We're completely safe here.

486
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,800
Code green! Now!

487
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:24,158
Lock all sensors on the fugitive.

488
00:39:24,248 --> 00:39:25,840
Activate external sound.

489
00:39:27,808 --> 00:39:31,847
<i>Dr Hamster-wheel,</i>
<i>you are hereby ordered to surrender.</i>

490
00:39:31,928 --> 00:39:35,284
It's Hämsterviel,
you absurd Grand Councilwoman

491
00:39:35,368 --> 00:39:37,563
<i>with your large pointy collar.</i>

492
00:39:37,648 --> 00:39:38,637
Prepare to fire.

493
00:39:42,248 --> 00:39:43,681
Don't shoot!

494
00:39:43,768 --> 00:39:46,646
He's got Stitch's cousins.

495
00:39:47,168 --> 00:39:49,363
Cousins.

496
00:39:53,288 --> 00:39:54,641
Fire at will.

497
00:39:56,568 --> 00:39:59,207
Major electrical surge.
All systems failing.

498
00:39:59,288 --> 00:40:00,403
Brace yourselves.

499
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:09,880
Hurry up, you great lumbering idiot!

500
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:13,000
This is Cobra. 10-13.

501
00:40:13,088 --> 00:40:15,443
- <i>10-13.</i>
- All systems off line.

502
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:16,927
No injuries reported.

503
00:40:17,008 --> 00:40:18,043
We're alright.

504
00:40:18,128 --> 00:40:21,564
Thank goodness. Our little
broken family is back together.

505
00:40:21,648 --> 00:40:24,287
I have family?

506
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:25,562
I have family.

507
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:28,367
And you've got family too, Stitch.

508
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:31,167
We're getting those experiments back.

509
00:40:35,568 --> 00:40:37,365
Lilo!

510
00:40:57,328 --> 00:40:59,398
Well, now what do we do?

511
00:40:59,488 --> 00:41:02,048
We hope
they can pull off another miracle.

512
00:41:06,768 --> 00:41:09,328
<i>Container ready. Select experiment.</i>

513
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:12,718
So many nasty experiments.

514
00:41:12,808 --> 00:41:16,881
I shall wreak mayhem
on the stinky galactic empire.

515
00:41:16,968 --> 00:41:18,287
- Thank you.
- What?

516
00:41:18,368 --> 00:41:19,562
You little trog!

517
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,685
- Pesky Earthling.
- You want it? Catch.

518
00:41:27,928 --> 00:41:30,158
You little...

519
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,725
Get them back!

520
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:42,923
The window!

521
00:41:45,768 --> 00:41:48,805
- The window's open.
- <i>Warning. Window is open.</i>

522
00:41:51,328 --> 00:41:53,046
Be free, cousin.

523
00:41:53,128 --> 00:41:54,402
No!

524
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,803
Little girl has saved
the experiments.

525
00:42:13,888 --> 00:42:16,197
- Is very good.
- Very good?

526
00:42:16,288 --> 00:42:19,485
It's not very good.
It's the opposite of very good.

527
00:42:19,568 --> 00:42:20,796
It's very bad.

528
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:24,244
625 experiment pods
activated by water

529
00:42:24,328 --> 00:42:26,762
raining on
one of the wettest spots on Earth?

530
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:29,965
Actually is only 623.

531
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,037
Whatever!

532
00:42:50,728 --> 00:42:53,003
I'm afraid Pleakley is right.

533
00:42:53,088 --> 00:42:55,921
This is indeed very bad.

534
00:43:02,328 --> 00:43:04,319
This'll keep you two out of trouble,

535
00:43:04,568 --> 00:43:08,117
until Dr Hämsterviel
can dispose of you properly.

536
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:15,243
Well, that didn't exactly work out.

537
00:43:15,328 --> 00:43:18,001
But at least
we saved all the cousins.

538
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:27,798
Maybe Jumba and Pleakley and Nani
and David will find them a nice home.

539
00:43:38,288 --> 00:43:42,679
Don't be scared, Stitch.
I'll figure out a way to rescue you.

540
00:43:44,408 --> 00:43:47,764
Nobody gets left behind.

541
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:49,884
Or forgotten.

542
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,082
You think you're so...

543
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:22,766
Phone book!

544
00:44:23,128 --> 00:44:25,358
Phone book. Yes, sir.

545
00:44:33,648 --> 00:44:35,081
One second.

546
00:44:42,728 --> 00:44:45,083
You think you're so clever,
don't you?

547
00:44:45,168 --> 00:44:49,525
You think you've outsmarted the
infamous Jacques Von Hämsterviel.

548
00:44:49,608 --> 00:44:52,042
Well, you made one grave mistake,

549
00:44:52,128 --> 00:44:55,677
you oh-so-adorable
little Hawaiian girl.

550
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:59,556
You delivered to me
Experiment number 626.

551
00:45:02,928 --> 00:45:08,321
I will now clone him
and create my own personal army.

552
00:45:11,168 --> 00:45:13,398
What shall I do with the Earth girl?

553
00:45:16,688 --> 00:45:19,566
She's of no use to me.

554
00:45:30,168 --> 00:45:31,647
Struggle all you want.

555
00:45:31,728 --> 00:45:34,447
You think you're so super-strong

556
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:38,123
with your "I can lift
up to 3,000 times my weight".

557
00:45:38,208 --> 00:45:43,123
Well, that is exactly why I designed
this restraint to hold your weight...

558
00:45:44,328 --> 00:45:46,762
...times 3,001.

559
00:45:56,048 --> 00:45:57,686
Let me go!

560
00:45:58,528 --> 00:46:02,441
I know a nice zoo that will pay
handsomely for a specimen like you.

561
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:12,361
<i>One minute to teleport.</i>

562
00:46:12,448 --> 00:46:17,203
Unfortunately, my patented cloning
process has one nasty side effect.

563
00:46:20,088 --> 00:46:22,158
I have to cut you in half.

564
00:46:30,448 --> 00:46:33,406
<i>Emergency alarm activated.</i>

565
00:46:33,488 --> 00:46:36,321
- Location?
- <i>Detention cell two.</i>

566
00:46:36,408 --> 00:46:38,842
Not again.

567
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:47,399
- 625? What's the emergency?
- I need to know our coordinates.

568
00:46:47,488 --> 00:46:49,638
I got us a deal
on a bunch of baloney.

569
00:46:53,648 --> 00:46:55,639
The suspense is killing me.

570
00:47:06,928 --> 00:47:09,317
Cousin.

571
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:20,841
What's happening?

572
00:47:25,128 --> 00:47:26,686
Thanks, cousin.

573
00:47:30,248 --> 00:47:31,601
<i>30 seconds.</i>

574
00:47:31,688 --> 00:47:34,805
Stitch! Help!

575
00:47:35,568 --> 00:47:39,038
I wasn't really going to
cut you in half. It was a joke.

576
00:47:39,128 --> 00:47:41,483
Didn't Jumba put a funny bone in you?

577
00:47:48,248 --> 00:47:49,840
Help!

578
00:47:49,928 --> 00:47:51,122
Lilo.

579
00:47:58,088 --> 00:47:59,441
<i>20 seconds.</i>

580
00:48:28,208 --> 00:48:30,039
Help!

581
00:48:30,528 --> 00:48:31,722
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

582
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,366
<i>Nine, eight,</i>

583
00:48:33,448 --> 00:48:35,245
<i>seven, six,</i>

584
00:48:35,328 --> 00:48:37,205
<i>five, four,</i>

585
00:48:37,288 --> 00:48:39,040
<i>three, two,</i>

586
00:48:39,128 --> 00:48:40,117
one,

587
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,607
<i>Teleporting now.</i>

588
00:48:45,968 --> 00:48:47,447
Lilo!

589
00:48:48,168 --> 00:48:49,362
Stitch?

590
00:48:49,448 --> 00:48:51,245
I'm in this one.

591
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:58,924
<i>Baloney order sent.</i>

592
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:01,476
<i>Sending little girl in ten seconds.</i>

593
00:49:01,568 --> 00:49:04,082
<i>Nine, eight...</i>

594
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:06,682
You're OK!

595
00:49:07,368 --> 00:49:09,359
What are you doing in here?

596
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:21,040
You're not taking my ship!

597
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:29,007
Gantu. Where's my baloney?
I got nothing here but cheese.

598
00:49:29,088 --> 00:49:30,965
- Where are they?
- Who?

599
00:49:31,048 --> 00:49:34,085
- Earth Girl and 626.
- I don't know. Not in here.

600
00:49:36,568 --> 00:49:39,366
- Bye-bye!
- Have a nice trip.

601
00:49:39,448 --> 00:49:40,961
Hit it, Sparky.

602
00:49:48,208 --> 00:49:50,119
Navigation is disabled.

603
00:49:50,208 --> 00:49:52,722
<i>Warning. Navigation disabled.</i>

604
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:00,801
Grilled cheese.

605
00:50:40,768 --> 00:50:43,566
Well, I don't think
we're gonna be going anywhere.

606
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:46,003
Looks like you and I
are working together.

607
00:50:46,088 --> 00:50:49,683
- Sandwich?
- No! I don't want a sandwich.

608
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:56,244
- Unless you have egg salad.
- No. Only cheese.

609
00:50:56,328 --> 00:50:58,888
Have you not been paying attention?

610
00:51:18,048 --> 00:51:19,879
<i>Aloha!</i> We're back!

611
00:51:19,968 --> 00:51:22,562
- Lilo!
- My genius experiment!

612
00:51:22,648 --> 00:51:24,366
Another miracle.

613
00:51:24,448 --> 00:51:29,238
These manacles are too tight,
you miserable oppressive do-gooders.

614
00:51:29,328 --> 00:51:31,523
Dr Hamster-wheel.

615
00:51:31,608 --> 00:51:33,280
Hämsterviel!

616
00:51:33,368 --> 00:51:36,519
We catch bad guy. You're welcome.

617
00:51:36,608 --> 00:51:39,168
Place him
in the high-security gerbil cage.

618
00:51:39,248 --> 00:51:42,206
Hamster cage! I am hamster-like!

619
00:51:42,288 --> 00:51:46,042
I will be back, you slobbering,
stinking humanoids and other aliens.

620
00:51:46,128 --> 00:51:49,882
Now, what are we gonna do with you,
Sparky?

621
00:51:49,968 --> 00:51:51,640
Let's see.

622
00:51:51,728 --> 00:51:55,004
You like making big bunches of power,
right?

623
00:51:56,248 --> 00:52:00,287
But you keep blowing up things like
light bulbs and spaceship consoles.

624
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:03,440
You need something really big
to play with.

625
00:52:03,528 --> 00:52:06,326
Something that won't explode
when you touch it.

626
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:07,841
What is it, Stitch?

627
00:52:35,848 --> 00:52:38,760
Well, if that isn't a pretty sight.

628
00:52:38,848 --> 00:52:42,204
This planet
just never ceases to amaze.

629
00:52:42,928 --> 00:52:48,002
Is just 500-watt alternating current
powering catadioptric lens.

630
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:49,999
It is beautiful.

631
00:52:50,088 --> 00:52:53,637
Which makes it all the more tragic
that the Earth is now infested

632
00:52:53,728 --> 00:52:55,764
with illegal genetic experiments.

633
00:52:55,848 --> 00:52:59,318
I'm afraid I have no choice
but to evacuate the planet

634
00:52:59,408 --> 00:53:01,205
and have them destroyed.

635
00:53:01,288 --> 00:53:04,803
- What?
- You can't destroy the experiments.

636
00:53:04,888 --> 00:53:07,766
They're <i>ohana.</i> Cousins.

637
00:53:07,848 --> 00:53:10,840
And each one of them
has a place where they belong.

638
00:53:10,928 --> 00:53:13,920
Just like Sparky
belongs at the lighthouse.

639
00:53:14,008 --> 00:53:16,238
And Stitch belongs with me.

640
00:53:18,648 --> 00:53:22,357
In fact, I'm starting to think
we're all cousins.

641
00:53:22,448 --> 00:53:24,439
Even me and you.

642
00:53:30,768 --> 00:53:33,999
Very well.
I won't destroy the experiments.

643
00:53:34,088 --> 00:53:37,524
If you can retrieve
each and every one

644
00:53:37,608 --> 00:53:42,887
and find, as you say,
the one place where each belongs.

645
00:53:42,968 --> 00:53:44,799
But they're out there right now.

646
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,118
And they're all very bad. Right?

647
00:53:47,208 --> 00:53:49,005
Yes, is true.

648
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:51,682
But once experiment
is turned to good,

649
00:53:51,768 --> 00:53:54,236
is completely useless for bad.

650
00:53:54,328 --> 00:53:57,525
I'm trying to fix for 627.

651
00:53:57,608 --> 00:54:01,965
I hereby designate you an undercover
intergalactic experiment retriever.

652
00:54:02,048 --> 00:54:03,959
And Stitch, too.

653
00:54:05,408 --> 00:54:08,127
That's crazy talk! There are 625...

654
00:54:08,208 --> 00:54:09,197
23.

655
00:54:09,848 --> 00:54:11,884
A whole lot of pods out there.

656
00:54:11,968 --> 00:54:13,526
How are you gonna find 'em?

657
00:54:13,608 --> 00:54:15,041
lt'll be easy.

658
00:54:15,128 --> 00:54:16,641
Like an Easter egg hunt.

659
00:54:16,728 --> 00:54:20,960
Yes, but even more deadly. You must
find them before they get wet.

660
00:54:21,048 --> 00:54:24,961
Before they get wet? No problem.

661
00:54:55,488 --> 00:55:00,118
Come on.
We've got 625 cousins to find.

662
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:03,166
- 623.
- Whatever.

663
00:55:03,248 --> 00:55:05,398
Are you sure they can handle this?

664
00:55:05,488 --> 00:55:07,797
Lilo is a very persistent
little girl.

665
00:55:07,888 --> 00:55:13,326
And with 626 they make one hot-shot
evil-genius experiment-catching team.

666
00:57:36,568 --> 00:57:38,047
Bye!

667
00:57:38,688 --> 00:57:42,840
Maybe the Grand Councilwoman will
let us go home with her this time.

668
00:57:48,848 --> 00:57:51,123
I'll get the wig.

669
00:57:52,648 --> 00:57:53,637
