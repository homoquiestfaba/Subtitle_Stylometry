HEATS THEM UP ENOUGH

657
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:52,702

WHAT, 25 PERCENT?

THIS IS PRETTY STRANGE,
HUH, KID?

689
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:31,668
WE DON'T DEAL
IN SMALL QUANTITY.

690
00:39:31,670 --> 00:39:34,871
NOTHING LESS THAN
A HUNDRED A RUN,
$1600 A POUND.

691

TRUST ME, IT'S IN BOTH
OF OUR BEST INTERESTS.

692

CAN YOU DEAL
WITH THAT KIND OF STOCK?

694
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:46,850
REMEMBERING THAT
EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION
IS THE KEY TO SUCCESS

695
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,385
FOR ALL OF US IN THIS BUSINESS.

696
00:39:48,387 --> 00:39:51,020
THE ONLY SURE THING
IS THE DEMAND.

697
00:39:51,022 --> 00:39:55,125

OLD-FASHIONED HARD WORK.

IMPORTANT. AND LET ME
TELL THEM WHY.

700
00:40:00,665 --> 00:40:03,767

WHEN IT REALLY, REALLY
STARTS TO COME,

702
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:12,442
WELL, SOMETIMES, BOYS,
IT IS HARD TO KEEP
YOUR GO KART ON THE TRACK.

703
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:19,682
ACTUALLY, WE WERE THINKING
MORE LIKE 300 POUNDS.

[TOPHER]
EXCUSE ME?

705
00:40:21,686 --> 00:40:24,087

THAT MANY ABLE BODIES?

707
00:40:27,559 --> 00:40:30,527
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

BLIND TRUST

THESE ARE GUYS I GREW UP WITH.

710
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,636
THEY'RE MY BROTHERS
BUT FROM DIFFERENT MOTHERS.

711
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:42,172
WELL, LET'S GET DOWN
TO BRASS TACKS.

712
00:40:42,174 --> 00:40:46,176
DRUG SMUGGLING-- YES.
THAT DAMN SURE IS WHAT IT IS--

713
00:40:46,178 --> 00:40:50,013
REQUIRES MORE COOL,
MORE INTEGRITY

714
00:40:50,015 --> 00:40:54,451
THAN ANY OTHER BUSINESS.
SO MUCH IS DONE ON A WINK
AND A HANDSHAKE.

715
00:40:54,453 --> 00:40:58,188
AND IF YOU DID GET BUSTED,
IT'S USUALLY BECAUSE SOMEBODY
WAS JEALOUS.

746
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:22,305
THREE HUNDRED POUNDS
WILL GET YOU $640,000.

00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,952
HEY. UH, BARRY?

809
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,155
HOW ARE YOU?

810
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:34,524
DO I KNOW YOU?
NATE NORMAN.

811
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,161
DO I KNOW YOU?

812
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:40,897
I KNOW YOU DO BUSINESS
WITH BRENDAN BUTLER.

813
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,835
WHAT THE FUCK
IS WITH BRENDAN BUTLER?

814
00:46:45,837 --> 00:46:47,904
IT'S COOL, IT'S COOL.

815
00:46:47,906 --> 00:46:50,373
I'M NOT A COP OR ANYTHING.

816
00:46:50,375 --> 00:46:53,242
KNOW PEOPLE WHO KNOW PEOPLE.

817
00:46:53,244 --> 00:46:56,946
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK TO YOUR TABLE
AND LEAVE ME ALONE?

818
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:59,515
"I AM NOT A COP."

819
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:05,354
I HAVE A BUSINESS PROPOSITION
FOR YOU, IF YOU'RE WILLING
TO HEAR ME OUT.

820
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:10,193
I HAVE CELL PHONE STORES.

821
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:11,494
DO YOU NEED A NEW PHONE?

822
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,329
UNHAPPY WITH YOUR PLAN?

823
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:17,233
NO.
THEN WE HAVE NO BUSINESS
TO DISCUSS.

862
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:09,111

00:49:45,315 --> 00:49:46,749
HI, BARRY.

864
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,064
HERE YOU ARE, SIR.

865
00:50:22,452 --> 00:50:26,756
THIS IS BETTER THAN ANYTHING
BRENDAN EVER BROUGHT ME.

866
00:50:28,759 --> 00:50:32,328
I HAVE A MUCH BETTER CONNECT
THAN BRENDAN WILL EVER HAVE.

867
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,296
OH, YEAH?

868
00:50:34,298 --> 00:50:37,066
LOOK, I'M HONEST
AND DEPENDABLE,

869
00:50:37,068 --> 00:50:40,636
AND I WILL NEVER RUN MY MOUTH
OFF THE WAY BRENDAN DOES.

870
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:42,371
THE ONLY REASON I EVEN
KNOW ABOUT YOU

871
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:44,774
IS BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS
FULL OF BEER AND BULLSHIT.

872
00:50:44,776 --> 00:50:47,676
TALKING ABOUT CRIMPING YOU

873
00:50:47,678 --> 00:50:52,448
AND RUNNING WITH YOUR MONEY
OR WHATEVER GHETTO SHIT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

874
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:56,318
HMM.

875
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:05,428
THAT IS $666,000.

876
00:51:05,430 --> 00:51:07,530
FOR 300 POUNDS.

877
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:18,274
IT'S 2600 A POUND.
I'M PAYING 2200.

878
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:22,812
OKAY.

879
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:27,850
CAN I TRUST YOU, NATE?

880
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:30,319
YEAH.

881
00:51:30,321 --> 00:51:32,688
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

882
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,623
YOU UNDERSTAND WHO I AM?

883
00:51:34,625 --> 00:51:38,394
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON TODAY?

884
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:43,165
THIS GOES BEYOND TRUST.

885
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:47,837
THIS IS A SECOND MORTGAGE.

886
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:49,638
ON YOUR LIFE.

887
00:51:50,841 --> 00:51:54,844
IF YOU WERE TO BURN ME,

888
00:51:54,846 --> 00:51:58,614
IT WOULD BE
A VERY BAD DAY FOR YOU.

889
00:51:58,616 --> 00:52:03,619
AND FOR ANYONE AND EVERYONE
YOU KNOW.

890
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:08,124
I KNOW THAT YOU WOULD LIKE
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER

891
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:13,195
PHILLIP TO RAISE HIS GRADES
IN MR. HARRIS'S HISTORY CLASS.

892
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:16,732
I KNOW YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE
YOUR MOTHER

893
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,635
NOT HAVE TO REFILL COFFEE
FOR A LIVING.

894
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:24,240
YEAH.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND

895
00:52:24,242 --> 00:52:28,444
HOW EASY IT WOULD BE

896
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:32,915
TO BURY 170 POUNDS
OF ROTTING MEAT

897
00:52:32,917 --> 00:52:37,453
WHERE NO ONE WILL
EVER FIND IT?

898
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:47,229
I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER
MY WORDS HERE.

899
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:52,168
I WANT YOU TO KEEP IT
IN YOUR MIND.

900
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,803
AND I WANT YOU TO LET IT GUIDE

901
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:58,774
YOUR ACTIONS.

902
00:52:58,776 --> 00:53:02,411
I WILL.

903
00:53:02,413 --> 00:53:04,947
POPPY.

904
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:08,551
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, SON.

905
00:53:08,553 --> 00:53:10,920
GO.

906
00:53:13,924 --> 00:53:16,525
YES, VIDAL. WE'LL GO
TO THE BEACH.

907
00:53:16,527 --> 00:53:18,827
WE GO TO THE BEACH NOW, OKAY?

908
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:21,330
YOU AND POPPY.

909
00:53:21,332 --> 00:53:25,334
<i>NOW THAT I HAD THE TOP-SHELF</i>
<i>FINANCING SECURED,</i>

910
00:53:25,336 --> 00:53:27,903
<i>IT WAS TIME TO ASSEMBLE</i>
<i>MY "A" TEAM.</i>

911
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:31,574
<i>BUT WHAT I NEEDED MOST</i>
<i>WAS FOR THEM TO BE</i>
<i>MINE, 100 PERCENT.</i>

912
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:34,810
<i>ONE WEAK LINK</i>
<i>AND MY SHIP WOULD SINK.</i>

913
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:38,581
<i>TURNED OUT I WAS GONNA</i>
<i>HAVE TO WHIP DONKEYS</i>
<i>INTO RACEHORSES.</i>

914
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,383
I'VE HAND-PICKED YOU GUYS
'CAUSE YOU'RE ALL
ADAPTABLE DUDES

915
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:44,987
WITH NO ATTITUDES,
JUST GRATITUDE.
AM I RIGHT ABOUT THAT?

916
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:47,923
MIKE HUNT, YOU FED ME
MANY TIMES FOR FREE.

917
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:49,992
NOW I'M GONNA
PAY YOU BACK.

918
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:52,995
TERRY, YOUR DAD BEING
A SHERIFF'S DEPUTY

919
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:54,897
IS GONNA PUT US
AT A HUGE ADVANTAGE.

920
00:53:54,899 --> 00:53:57,833
YOU'RE GONNA BE OUR EYES AND
EARS INSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT.

921
00:53:57,835 --> 00:54:01,637
DUSTIN, YOU'RE THE ONLY JOCK
IN HIGH SCHOOL WHO DIDN'T BEAT
THE SHIT OUT OF ME.

922
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:04,807
I APPRECIATE THAT.
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW
YOU'VE GOT A BURNT KNEE,

923
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:08,477
YOU'RE STILL CAPABLE
OF KICKING ASS
AND HAULING GRASS.

924
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:11,347
DYLAN, YOU'VE ALWAYS BEAT ME
IN PAINTBALL.

925
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:15,818
I WANT YOU TO HAVE MY BACK
IN CASE THINGS GO DOWN
O.K. CORRAL STYLE, YOU FEEL ME?

926
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,989
FUCKING PATRICK. I MEAN, WE'VE
BEEN FRIENDS SINCE WE WERE,
WHAT? FIVE YEARS OLD?

927
00:54:19,991 --> 00:54:23,025
REMEMBER THAT TIME I
GOT POPPED FOR SHOPLIFTING
AND YOU TOOK THE HEAT?

928
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:25,828
GOOD MAN.

929
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:29,298
SCUZZ.

930
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,300
YOU'RE JUST SCUZZ.

931
00:54:31,302 --> 00:54:34,003
SO I HAVE ONE QUESTION,
AND ONE QUESTION ONLY.

932
00:54:34,005 --> 00:54:36,005
CAN I TRUST YOU?

933
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:38,274
BECAUSE WE HOLD EACH OTHER'S
FUTURES IN OUR HANDS.

934
00:54:38,276 --> 00:54:40,776
UNITED WE STAND,
DIVIDED WE FALL.

935
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:43,879
AND IF WE FALL, IT'S
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S TALKING
WHEN THEY SHOULD BE LISTENING.

936
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:46,448
SOMEONE WHO HAS NO IDEA
WHAT THE CONCEPT OF COOL IS.

937
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:49,318
CLINT EASTWOOD IS COOL. TWELVE
TO TWENTY WORDS A PICTURE,

938
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,521
DOESN'T NEED TO BRAG,
DOESN'T NEED TO BOAST,
JUST GETS SHIT DONE.

939
00:54:52,523 --> 00:54:57,026
HOW MUCH ARE WE GETTING PAID?
RUNNERS GET PAID 3500 A RUN
AND DRIVERS GET 1500 A RUN.

940
00:54:57,028 --> 00:55:00,396
HOW MUCH ARE YOU GETTING PAID?
ENOUGH TO PAY YOU 3500 A RUN.

941
00:55:00,398 --> 00:55:03,599
I'M PUTTING EVERYTHING I HAVE,
EVERYONE I LOVE
OUT ON A SKINNY LIMB.

942
00:55:03,601 --> 00:55:06,835
SO, IF IT WORKS OUT, YEAH,
I MAY TAKE HOME SOME MONEY.

943
00:55:06,837 --> 00:55:09,038
YOU'RE GONNA BE PART
OF THE "A" TEAM, I NEED YOU

944
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,507
IN THE BEST SHAPE
OF YOUR LIFE.

945
00:55:11,509 --> 00:55:14,310
THAT MEANS WE TRAIN
AND WE TRAIN AND THEN
WE TRAIN SOME MORE.

946
00:55:14,312 --> 00:55:16,745
PAIN IS JUST WEAKNESS
LEAVING YOUR BODY.

947
00:55:16,747 --> 00:55:21,650
YOU WANT TO STOP AND TAKE
A BREAK? TAKE A LONG ONE
AND DON'T COME BACK.

948
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:25,054
WE CAN'T BE IN THE FOREST.
WE NEED TO BECOME THE FOREST.

949
00:55:25,056 --> 00:55:28,724
WE NEED TO BE PREPARED
FOR ANY AND EVERY EVENTUALITY.

950
00:55:28,726 --> 00:55:30,959
WE'RE GONNA RIG SCUZZ'S CAR
WITH GAS CANS TO EXPLODE

951
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,661
IF WE GET PULLED OVER
BY THE COPS.

952
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,330
WHOA!
OH, FUCK OFF.

953
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:36,332
WHAT THE FUCK? WHY MY CAR?

954
00:55:36,334 --> 00:55:37,933
BECAUSE IT'S READY
TO BLOW ANYWAY.

955
00:55:37,935 --> 00:55:41,670
AND BECAUSE I SAID SO.
FUCKING CHILL.
YOU SOUND LIKE MY DAD.

956
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:45,040
HE MIGHT BE. I MEAN, THE WAY
YOUR MOM SUCKS AND FUCKS
AROUND TOWN--

957
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:47,576
FUCK YOU.

958
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:50,479
WE'RE USING TWO CARS,
ONE DECOY AND ONE LOAD CAR.

959
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:54,917
MAKE SURE ALL THE CARS
ARE CLEAN. INSURANCE,
EVEN TIRE PRESSURE.

960
00:55:54,919 --> 00:55:57,353
AND WE NEVER HAVE THE CRISP
FOR THE PRODUCT

961
00:55:57,355 --> 00:55:59,054
IN THE SAME CAR
WITH THE RUNNERS.

962
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,758
IF WE GET TAILED,
THE REAR DECOY

963
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,362
WILL ATTACK AND DISTRACT
AND WE WILL KEEP ON ROLLING.

964
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:08,397
REMEMBER THE DETAILS.

965
00:56:08,399 --> 00:56:10,966
PLAN THE RUN AND RUN THE PLAN.

966
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:13,068
CELL PHONES OFF.

967
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,939
IF YOUR PHONE'S ON,
THE FEDS CAN TRACE YOU
ABSOLUTELY ANYWHERE.

968
00:56:16,941 --> 00:56:19,775
WE MAINTAIN
