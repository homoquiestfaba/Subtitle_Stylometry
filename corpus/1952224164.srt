1
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,298
Together we shall save our planet

2
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,828
or together we shall die in flames.

3
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:31,780
<i>First comes love, </ i></i>

4
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:33,146
<i>then comes marriage, </ i></i>

5
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:40,214
They always look like they're having more fun.

6
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,553
Everyone has more fun.

7
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:43,525
Obviously they have more fun than we do.

8
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,528
Have you seen Patricia?

9
00:02:45,562 --> 00:02:47,052
They are huge!

10
00:02:47,096 --> 00:02:48,586
She says she's gonna let me touch them.

11
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:49,620
Bullshit...

12
00:02:49,666 --> 00:02:52,692
She said! She did! For a dollar.

13
00:02:52,735 --> 00:02:55,295
To you? She said that to you?

14
00:02:55,338 --> 00:02:57,806
Not exactly, not to me.

15
00:02:57,841 --> 00:02:58,933
Thought so.

16
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,511
Carl said you were faggot.

17
00:03:02,545 --> 00:03:04,103
So?

18
00:03:04,147 --> 00:03:05,614
So - he said you were fag.

19
00:03:05,648 --> 00:03:08,242
Well, what are you gonna do?

20
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,411
Nothing.

21
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:12,853
You can't do nothing.

22
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:17,056
Some friend you are...

23
00:03:17,093 --> 00:03:19,459
- Come on, fag!
- You're the fag!

24
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,554
Let's see what you got.

25
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:26,158
Fight, fight!

26
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:53,755
That's for setting me up.

27
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:14,014
What... are you... doing?

28
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:16,416
Nothing sister.

29
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:20,689
God smiles on remorseful Mr Stafford,

30
00:04:20,723 --> 00:04:23,214
not the impenitent.

31
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:57,123
Gentlemen, it's five o'clock.

32
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,822
Detention is over.

33
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,597
In the eyes of God all sinners
can be redeemed.

34
00:05:07,637 --> 00:05:09,537
Yes, sister.

35
00:05:09,572 --> 00:05:12,939
My eyes see differently.

36
00:05:12,976 --> 00:05:15,240
Yes, sister.

37
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:21,816
- Jimmy, I...
- Fuck you!

38
00:05:21,851 --> 00:05:22,977
I didn't mean...

39
00:05:23,019 --> 00:05:26,352
You're an asshole...
Both of you.

40
00:06:13,736 --> 00:06:15,829
Mom? Dad?

41
00:08:16,526 --> 00:08:19,393
Son? You in there?

42
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:21,123
Yeah, I'm here.

43
00:08:21,164 --> 00:08:23,496
You... working hard in there?

44
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:24,898
Leave him alone, Mike.

45
00:08:24,934 --> 00:08:26,333
Poor son...

46
00:08:26,369 --> 00:08:29,202
He'll go blind... grow hair on his palms...

47
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:32,765
Mike, he's 13...
he's at age.

48
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:43,983
Hey, guys.

49
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:55,692
Roger, have you seen Patricia this morning?

50
00:08:55,731 --> 00:08:57,722
She's very beautiful.

51
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,710
Mike?

52
00:09:09,745 --> 00:09:10,939
Could you hurry up?

53
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,880
What's the rush? King
gets arrested all the time.

54
00:09:12,915 --> 00:09:14,246
I want a good seat.

55
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,060
<i>The Richmond Museum of Modern Art.</i>

56
00:10:48,144 --> 00:10:49,941
<i>Your presence is

57
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:51,276

63
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:19,838
Catherine.

64
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,793
Can I help you with something?

65
00:11:45,468 --> 00:11:50,872
Yeah, I uh, I live across the street.

66
00:11:50,906 --> 00:11:53,466
Yes?

67
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:56,808
I was wondering if you need

68
00:11:56,846 --> 00:11:59,747
any work done. You know in the garden,

69
00:11:59,782 --> 00:12:01,044
around the house.

70
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:02,880
I'm trying to earn some money.

71
00:12:02,918 --> 00:12:04,010
For what?

72
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:06,112
A trip. To Europe.

73
00:12:06,155 --> 00:12:07,588
With my class.

74
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,523
That sounds very adventurous.

75
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:12,057
Adam.
- Adam.

76
00:12:18,334 --> 00:12:19,596
Are you coming in?

77
00:12:30,713 --> 00:12:32,840
What can you do?
- What?

78
00:12:34,483 --> 00:12:36,383
Around the house.

79
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:39,081
Oh. Cleaning, fits...
All the usual stuff.

80
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:41,055
And you want me to pay you for that?

81
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,352
For my trip...

82
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:43,415
To Europe?

83
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:51,230
You know him? President Kennedy?

84
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:52,791
We've met...

85
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:58,102
My mom shook hands with him once,
at a dinner.

86
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,768
She said it made her feeling she was naked.

87
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:03,278
You father mustn't have liked that too much.

88
00:13:03,312 --> 00:13:05,303
My dad said he stole the election

89
00:13:05,347 --> 00:13:07,178
by being a pretty boy on a television.

90
00:13:07,216 --> 00:13:09,582
What do you think?

91
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:13,384
I don't know, I didn't see it.

92
00:13:31,774 --> 00:13:33,901
I need my garden landscaped.

93
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:35,069
Can you do that?

94
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,304
Sure.

95
00:13:36,345 --> 00:13:39,542
Have you ever do it before? Worked in a garden?

96
00:13:41,417 --> 00:13:43,078
Then I'm not gonna pay you very much, am I?

97
00:13:43,118 --> 00:13:44,949
I'm a fast learner.

98
00:13:44,987 --> 00:13:46,648
I bet you are.

99
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:49,113
Come back tomorrow.

100
00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:52,182
Right.

101
00:13:52,228 --> 00:13:53,957
Tomorrow.

102
00:14:05,441 --> 00:14:07,966
Made her feel like she was naked...

103
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,177
Shit.

104
00:14:24,193 --> 00:14:26,457
Adam, dinner.

105
00:14:26,495 --> 00:14:27,689
Alright!

106
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,027
Now, Adam, now.

107
00:14:29,064 --> 00:14:31,089
I said I'm coming.

108
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:34,261
Just not while you're in the bathroom, right?

109
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:43,734
Adam.

110
00:14:47,383 --> 00:14:48,441
Adam.

111
00:14:48,484 --> 00:14:50,975
I said I'd be right there.

112
00:15:00,362 --> 00:15:02,353
- Hey, Faith.
- Hi.

113
00:15:02,398 --> 00:15:03,626
Hi, Patricia.

114
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:04,655
Dipshit.

115
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,793
Fuck off, Carl.

116
00:15:06,835 --> 00:15:09,963
Right... fuck off.
- Okay.

117
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:18,672
I was just wondering if... you know

118
00:15:18,714 --> 00:15:21,182
you'd want to come by my house sometime after school...

119
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,706
And do what?

120
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:24,218
I don't know.

121
00:15:24,253 --> 00:15:26,585
Talk, listen to some records...

122
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:31,425
Yeah, I'd like that.

123
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,825
Great, so...

124
00:15:32,861 --> 00:15:37,093
Mr Stafford, is there a faintest possible reason

125
00:15:37,132 --> 00:15:40,898
you might have for not being where you're supposed to be?

126
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:42,563
No, sister.

127
00:15:42,605 --> 00:15:44,095
I thought not.

128
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:04,426
It's me, Adam... from next door.

129
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:07,054
- Your garden?
- Right.

130
00:16:07,096 --> 00:16:08,495
I'm going to be your gardener...

131
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,202
Who painted these?

132
00:16:21,243 --> 00:16:22,733
I did.

133
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:27,505
Do you like them?

134
00:16:27,549 --> 00:16:31,576
I think so, but... they're just colors, right?

135
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,713
You know, aren't they supposed to mean anything?

136
00:16:33,756 --> 00:16:36,520
Color is color.

137
00:16:36,558 --> 00:16:38,617
What do they mean?

138
00:16:38,661 --> 00:16:40,561
Whatever you want them to.

139
00:16:40,596 --> 00:16:43,588
Things are what we make of them.

140
00:16:43,632 --> 00:16:46,066
- Form is dead.
- What?

141
00:16:46,101 --> 00:16:47,864
Form is dead.

142
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:50,167
Have you ever seen a man in building?

143
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,765
Broken windows, cracked doors and walls?

144
00:16:52,808 --> 00:16:54,241
Sure.

145
00:16:54,276 --> 00:16:56,938
From the moment that building was built

146
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:58,947
it started to fall apart,

147
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:01,313
just depends on how you choose to look at it.

148
00:17:02,851 --> 00:17:05,149
Form is dead.

149
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:07,655
I like that.

150
00:17:11,894 --> 00:17:14,294
Looks pretty good to me.

151
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:19,225
I want you to rip it all up.

152
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,859
All of it?

153
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,372
Everything.

154
00:17:24,406 --> 00:17:28,035
Just scoop it up and throw it all away.

155
00:17:28,077 --> 00:17:30,637
I want dirt, a new beginning,

156
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:33,011
nothing boxed or restrained.

157
00:17:33,048 --> 00:17:36,779
Rip it all up, we'll start all over again.

158
00:17:36,819 --> 00:17:38,650
Form is dead, right?

159
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:41,485
Exactly.

160
00:18:09,985 --> 00:18:11,509
That might help.

161
00:18:13,822 --> 00:18:15,790
You look... beautiful.

162
00:18:17,893 --> 00:18:19,520
I bet you say that to all the girls.

163
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:23,161
No.

164
00:18:23,198 --> 00:18:27,032
Finish up that tree then head on home.

165
00:18:30,472 --> 00:18:33,771
The Cubans are never gonna forgive
Kennedy. Ever.

166
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,504
Well is not like it really matters.

167
00:18:35,544 --> 00:18:39,446
We'll have communists living
90 miles away.

168
00:18:39,481 --> 00:18:41,449
God, Castro laughs at us.

169
00:18:41,483 --> 00:18:42,882
Laughs at us.

170
00:18:42,918 --> 00:18:46,046
Well, you look like you've been digging to China.

171
00:18:46,088 --> 00:18:47,646
Where've you been?

172
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:49,657
Working in the garden.

173
00:18:49,691 --> 00:18:51,158
What garden?

174
00:18:51,193 --> 00:18:52,524
Mrs. Caswell.

175
00:18:53,996 --> 00:18:54,985
Who?

176
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,122
Mrs. Caswell.

177
00:18:56,165 --> 00:18:57,962
She moved in across the street.

178
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,468
Catherine Caswell?

179
00:19:00,502 --> 00:19:02,197
M- hm.

180
00:19:02,237 --> 00:19:03,636
Why won't you have a seat, bud?

181
00:19:11,947 --> 00:19:15,713
Catherine Caswell.
She's very nice, isn't she?

182
00:19:15,751 --> 00:19:16,843
Yeah, I like her.

183
00:19:16,885 --> 00:19:18,318
She's a very special lady.

184
00:19:18,353 --> 00:19:23,655
She is the one who has seen and done a lot of things.

185
00:19:23,692 --> 00:19:24,954
Too many things.

186
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:26,927
She has had a very hard life,

187
00:19:26,962 --> 00:19:30,591
she is... very emotional...

188
00:19:30,632 --> 00:19:33,465
and maybe she's not the best person

189
00:19:33,502 --> 00:19:35,629
for you to working for after school.

190
00:19:35,671 --> 00:19:36,763
Why not?

191
00:19:36,805 --> 00:19:41,674
Well, it isn't easy to explain.

192
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:44,304
She's different than we are, Adam.

193
00:19:44,346 --> 00:19:48,112
She just doesn't care about the same things.

194
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,118
She doesn't care about her own son, for God's sake.

195
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:51,414
Addie.

196
00:19:51,453 --> 00:19:52,681
She has a son?

197
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:55,121
Had a son.
Had.

198
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:56,215
What happened?

199
00:19:56,258 --> 00:19:57,555
It doesn't matter what happened.

200
00:19:57,593 --> 00:20:02,053
What matters is that you stay away from her.

201
00:20:02,097 --> 00:20:03,758
You said...

202
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:06,393
You said to get a job, to earn some money, you said...

203
00:20:06,435 --> 00:20:08,164
Fine, get a job, just not with her...

204
00:20:08,203 --> 00:20:11,570
Okay, Adam, working for her
is alright.

205
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:12,767
Mike!

206
00:20:12,808 --> 00:20:14,332
Just don't linger, okay?

207
00:20:14,376 --> 00:20:16,776
Do what she asks, then come home.

208
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:21,405
Okay, buddy?

209
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,849
Okay.

210
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,184
What'd you do at school today?

211
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:27,552
Nothing.

212
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:32,055
Great.

213
00:20:32,094 --> 00:20:36,793
All free men, where ever they may live

214
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:39,824
are citizens of Berlin,

215
00:20:39,868 --> 00:20:42,735
and therefore
as a free man,

216
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:48,732
I take pride in the words:
Ich bin ein Berliner.

217
00:21:01,156 --> 00:21:05,650
There are many people in the world

218
00:21:05,694 --> 00:21:10,324
that really don't understand... or say they don't

219
00:21:10,365 --> 00:21:15,428
what is the difference between the free world

220
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,030
and the communist world.

221
00:21:18,073 --> 00:21:21,941
Let them come to Berlin.

222
00:22:06,421 --> 00:22:09,788
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.

223
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:48,522
What?

224
00:22:48,563 --> 00:22:52,966
So you and the president really are friends.

225
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,603
Of course we are.

226
00:22:56,638 --> 00:22:58,196
We met at school.

227
00:23:00,642 --> 00:23:03,577
What's that supposed to mean?

228
00:23:03,612 --> 00:23:05,773
I was looking out my window last night and...

229
00:23:05,814 --> 00:23:06,974
And saw nothing.

230
00:23:07,015 --> 00:23:09,745
You saaw absolutely nothing.

231
00:23:09,785 --> 00:23:12,083
Okay, sorry...

232
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:21,127
There are some things, Adam, that are private.

233
00:23:21,163 --> 00:23:23,529
And they should stay that way.

234
00:23:23,565 --> 00:23:25,590
Like your son?

235
00:23:32,007 --> 00:23:33,668
Who told you about my son?

236
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,141
My parents.

237
00:23:35,177 --> 00:23:37,543
Your parents...

238
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,170
Oh my God...

239
00:23:40,215 --> 00:23:43,707
If you had a son, then you must
have a husband, right?

240
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:47,247
Ex husband.

241
00:23:47,289 --> 00:23:50,281
What's he like?

242
00:23:50,325 --> 00:23:52,316
He's gone, that's what he's like.

243
00:23:56,898 --> 00:24:00,994
He was a, a little boy.

244
00:24:01,036 --> 00:24:02,230
Just like you.

245
00:24:02,270 --> 00:24:04,932
I'm not a little boy.

246
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:10,434
No, I don't suppose you are.

247
00:24:14,449 --> 00:24:15,609
Where are you going?

248
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:19,177
Like if that's any of your business.

249
00:25:33,061 --> 00:25:35,495
He won't talk to anyone
at Langley, Catherine?

250
00:25:37,132 --> 00:25:39,032
Jack won't talk about it.

251
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:41,535
He says it's over and done with.

252
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,832
Perhaps you need to convince him

253
00:25:42,871 --> 00:25:46,034
that the conversation must remain open.

254
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:50,372
- He said that Bobby said...
- Christ!

255
00:25:50,412 --> 00:25:51,743
Bobby.

256
00:26:11,433 --> 00:26:12,593
Air support.

257
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:15,797
That's what it was:
lack of air support.

258
00:26:17,405 --> 00:26:22,035
Well it's always easy to second guess desicion once it's been made.

259
00:26:22,077 --> 00:26:24,068
Especially when it's the wrong decision.

260
00:26:24,112 --> 00:26:26,307
We are talking about the man who stood in front of the wall

261
00:26:26,348 --> 00:26:30,045
and mispronounced "Berliner".

262
00:26:30,085 --> 00:26:34,545
Ich bin ein Berliner:
We are all jelly dougnuts.

263
00:26:36,024 --> 00:26:38,015
My God, can we talk about
something else, please?

264
00:26:38,059 --> 00:26:39,117
It's Washington.

265
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,957
What else is there to talk about?

266
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:43,260
Life maybe?

267
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:46,825
Life? There is life outside politics?

268
00:26:46,868 --> 00:26:49,268
There is nothing outside politics.

269
00:27:23,204 --> 00:27:25,069
Catherine Caswell.

270
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:28,007
You should've seen him.
He came home full of mud.

271
00:27:28,043 --> 00:27:29,908
Like he was in the Bay of Pigs.

272
00:27:31,446 --> 00:27:34,377
The Boy Pigs.

273
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:41,451
Form is dead.

274
00:27:56,938 --> 00:27:59,234
Hey.
- Hey.

275
00:27:59,274 --> 00:28:01,139
We're going to your house, right?

276
00:28:01,176 --> 00:28:03,303
Yeah, great.
Definitely.

277
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:07,479
Hey, guys.
Ready to go?

278
00:28:07,515 --> 00:28:08,812
Magda's gonna come with us.

279
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,283
That's okay, isn't it?

280
00:28:10,318 --> 00:28:12,411
Sure.

281
00:28:12,454 --> 00:28:14,445
- I guess...
- Let go.

282
00:28:28,803 --> 00:28:30,771
Cool house.

283
00:28:30,805 --> 00:28:32,568
What do your parents do?

284
00:28:32,607 --> 00:28:35,542
They're writers.
Journalists.

285
00:28:35,577 --> 00:28:36,771
My mom's a writer...

286
00:28:36,811 --> 00:28:38,278
cook books.

287
00:28:38,313 --> 00:28:41,510
Cool.

288
00:28:41,549 --> 00:28:43,813
You guys just pretend I'm not here.

289
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,750
I'm not here.

290
00:29:01,169 --> 00:29:02,295
What was that?

291
00:29:02,337 --> 00:29:07,798
It's kissing, you stupid.
French kissing.

292
00:29:07,842 --> 00:29:09,241
I went to France once.

293
00:29:09,277 --> 00:29:11,404
So you should know how to do this.

294
00:29:11,446 --> 00:29:13,846
Of course.

295
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,917
What... is that?

296
00:29:28,396 --> 00:29:30,193
It's uh... my tooth.

297
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:35,334
That is completely disgusting...

298
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:38,100
I've gotta go.

299
00:29:38,139 --> 00:29:41,472
My mom's gonna pick me up.

300
00:29:41,509 --> 00:29:43,773
Yeah, we better.

301
00:29:47,248 --> 00:29:51,378
Call me when you have it fixed.

302
00:29:58,326 --> 00:30:01,090
You broke a tooth and
you weren't gonna tell us about it?

303
00:30:01,129 --> 00:30:02,596
I glued it back in.

304
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,961
You glued it?

305
00:30:03,998 --> 00:30:05,727
I thought it would be okay.

306
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,361
This isn't a baby tooth, Adam.
These don't grow back.

307
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:09,529
I know that.

308
00:30:09,571 --> 00:30:11,300
Then why didn't you tell us?

309
00:30:13,708 --> 00:30:14,834
I don't know.

310
00:30:14,876 --> 00:30:15,865
What is wrong with you?

311
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:17,901
Nothing is wrong with me.

312
00:30:17,946 --> 00:30:19,971
What is that supposed to mean?

313
00:30:20,014 --> 00:30:21,982
Every day you come home dirty

314
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:23,540
after working in that woman's garden.

315
00:30:23,585 --> 00:30:24,745
- You spent all the time alone in your room...
- You said...

316
00:30:24,786 --> 00:30:25,810
- You spent all the time alone in your room...

317
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:27,981
- Because you...
- You don't talk to us anymore.

318
00:30:28,022 --> 00:30:29,649
It's your tooth,
for God's sake.

319
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:31,750
My tooth!
My tooth.

320
00:30:38,733 --> 00:30:39,722
What was that?

321
00:30:39,767 --> 00:30:41,530
I have no idea.

322
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:49,106
Well... we'll call the dentist
in the morning.

323
00:31:45,934 --> 00:31:50,032
Society girls and Washington wives.

324
00:31:52,073 --> 00:31:56,339
Nero feels...
Rome burns.

325
00:31:58,346 --> 00:32:00,780
Who the fuck are you?

326
00:32:03,017 --> 00:32:06,919
It isn't safe to ignore people
in the dark kid.

327
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:11,817
You didn't answer my question.

328
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:14,919
Oh, you like to sneak around,
is that what you like to do?

329
00:32:14,963 --> 00:32:17,090
You like to watch?

330
00:32:17,131 --> 00:32:19,531
You like to sneak around and watch?

331
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,364
How about I put you in jail?

332
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:24,803
Let other people watch you for a while.

333
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:27,330
You can't put me in jail.

334
00:32:27,375 --> 00:32:29,206
Oh no?

335
00:32:29,243 --> 00:32:30,938
You're not a cop.

336
00:32:30,979 --> 00:32:32,844
What makes you say that?

337
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,869
You're drunk.

338
00:32:35,416 --> 00:32:38,408
Drunks come in all shapes and sizes, kid.

339
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:40,284
Come on.

340
00:32:50,164 --> 00:32:54,294
So this is what a journey to higher consciousness looks like?

341
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:55,597
Hello, Graham.

342
00:32:57,805 --> 00:32:59,864
Pathetic...

343
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,135
Look at you.

344
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:05,273
I found this peeping tom outside.

345
00:33:06,681 --> 00:33:09,445
- Hi, Adam.
- Hi.

346
00:33:09,484 --> 00:33:12,885
Oh. You know him...

347
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,253
He's doing some work for me...
in the garden.

348
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:18,383
In the garden...

349
00:33:19,427 --> 00:33:22,919
Looks like Vietnam. Post napalm.

350
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:25,057
Don't you like it?

351
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:26,623
No.

352
00:33:26,668 --> 00:33:27,896
Good.

353
00:33:27,935 --> 00:33:29,926
I think I'm gonna go.

354
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:30,960
Why?

355
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:36,006
It's nice to have a man around the house.

356
00:33:36,044 --> 00:33:39,946
What the fuck are you laughing at?

357
00:33:39,981 --> 00:33:41,005
What!

358
00:33:44,452 --> 00:33:47,478
Go upstairs.
I'll be up in a minute.

359
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:05,295
What happened to you?

360
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:06,499
Where did you go?

361
00:34:09,043 --> 00:34:12,501
I'm right here, Graham,

362
00:34:12,547 --> 00:34:14,981
just like always.

363
00:34:15,016 --> 00:34:17,450
You made a promise to me...

364
00:34:17,485 --> 00:34:20,977
and Harris.

365
00:34:21,022 --> 00:34:23,513
You said you'd take care of us,

366
00:34:23,558 --> 00:34:26,356
even after he...

367
00:34:31,332 --> 00:34:33,630
We could have had another kid.

368
00:34:33,668 --> 00:34:35,363
We were still a family.

369
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:42,571
People see you...

370
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:46,440
It's not as if it's a secret

371
00:34:46,481 --> 00:34:47,971
Going in and out of the White House.

372
00:34:48,015 --> 00:34:49,505
They see you, Catherine.

373
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:51,040
Why do you care?

374
00:34:51,085 --> 00:34:52,518
- You're my wife.
- Was!

375
00:34:52,553 --> 00:34:55,021
Was your wife.

376
00:34:57,158 --> 00:34:59,683
Everyone knows...

377
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:01,718
and they laugh about it.

378
00:35:01,763 --> 00:35:03,094
And you know why?

379
00:35:03,131 --> 00:35:05,861
Cause you're not the only one,
Catherine.

380
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,563
He's got a string of women
and he fucks them all.

381
00:35:09,604 --> 00:35:11,265
Every last one of them.

382
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:15,007
You can't hurt me anymore, Graham.

383
00:35:15,042 --> 00:35:19,741
Not you, not your government,

384
00:35:19,781 --> 00:35:23,217
your precious agents.

385
00:35:23,251 --> 00:35:25,981
None of it can touch me.

386
00:35:29,657 --> 00:35:33,024
He was my son too...

387
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:35,392
Was he?

388
00:37:00,815 --> 00:37:02,305
Tough day at the office?

389
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,910
I got Cubans running around south
Florida and Louisiana,

390
00:37:04,952 --> 00:37:08,183
just looking to shoot someone.
Idiots with guns.

391
00:37:08,222 --> 00:37:12,022
Well I told you the anticomunism brigade won't work.

392
00:37:12,059 --> 00:37:14,892
They all want back in on their own terms.

393
00:37:14,929 --> 00:37:18,865
Almost like a marriage gone bad, wouldn't you say?

394
00:37:21,002 --> 00:37:22,162
Almost...

395
00:37:25,907 --> 00:37:27,636
You trained her very well.

396
00:37:27,675 --> 00:37:28,972
She was an Agency wife.

397
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:31,103
Is she going to be a liability?

398
00:37:36,784 --> 00:37:38,979
She writes everything down.

399
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:40,988
She always has, in a diary.

400
00:37:42,189 --> 00:37:45,488
I would've thought you'd've broken that sort of a habit.

401
00:37:45,526 --> 00:37:47,255
You try break it, we'll see how far you get.

402
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,661
Mr Del Valle, how are you?

403
00:37:54,702 --> 00:37:59,469
Every morning when I wake up
I think of Fidel laughing at us.

404
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:01,600
Laughing and laughing behind his cojiba.

405
00:38:01,642 --> 00:38:03,405
It's not funny though, is it?

406
00:38:03,444 --> 00:38:06,743
Much like that playboy Kennedy, he laughs at us too.

407
00:38:06,781 --> 00:38:08,612
You know Mr. Caswell, of course?

408
00:38:08,649 --> 00:38:10,810
Yes, of course.

409
00:38:10,851 --> 00:38:13,319
We must act
sooner rather than later.

410
00:39:59,126 --> 00:40:00,650
Bay of Pigs.

411
00:40:00,694 --> 00:40:02,525
Oh boy...

412
00:40:05,266 --> 00:40:07,359
<i>What do those secret service agents think when</i>

413
00:40:07,401 --> 00:40:11,030
<i>they're waiting outside while
Jack and I are swinging?</i>

414
00:40:11,072 --> 00:40:13,905
<i>He doesn't trust Lucian,
not anymore.</i>

415
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:16,409
<i>It's only Bobby now.</i>

416
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:20,679
You should have seen your face in light, Charlie.

417
00:40:20,714 --> 00:40:23,649
I was to worried about your hands...

418
00:40:23,684 --> 00:40:25,083
You're in a hurry.

419
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,019
Things to see, places to go.

420
00:40:27,054 --> 00:40:28,214
People too.

421
00:40:28,255 --> 00:40:29,745
Exactly.

422
00:40:32,793 --> 00:40:35,261
Look at you...

423
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:37,355
I didn't invite you over to look.

424
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:19,438
So soon?

425
00:41:19,473 --> 00:41:21,771
Helene is making dinner, quail or something.

426
00:41:21,809 --> 00:41:22,867
I promised I'll be there.

427
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,310
Give her my love.

428
00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:27,576
She read that Huxley book you suggested.

429
00:41:27,615 --> 00:41:28,946
Didn't like it.

430
00:41:28,983 --> 00:41:31,975
No surprises there.

431
00:41:38,792 --> 00:41:40,123
I could leave her, you know?

432
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:42,152
For me?

433
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,891
Don't bother...

434
00:41:46,934 --> 00:41:48,561
My quail needs work.

435
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:56,365
Have a nice dinner!

436
00:42:07,588 --> 00:42:11,183
You left your book there on the floor, dead giveaway.

437
00:42:23,671 --> 00:42:26,196
I'm um, I'm sorry...

438
00:42:27,741 --> 00:42:30,369
There's no rain, so I'll just go home.

439
00:42:32,846 --> 00:42:34,336
Sit down.

440
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,545
Never be ashamed being excited, Adam.

441
00:42:45,859 --> 00:42:47,884
Just don't do it again.

442
00:42:47,928 --> 00:42:50,089
I won't.

443
00:42:53,534 --> 00:42:54,899
I saw your husband today.

444
00:42:54,935 --> 00:42:56,698
How exciting for you.

445
00:42:56,737 --> 00:42:59,535
He was with another guy, in a dirty suit.

446
00:42:59,573 --> 00:43:01,734
They were talking about you.

447
00:43:01,775 --> 00:43:05,006
They met somebody,
guy with an accent.

448
00:43:05,045 --> 00:43:06,740
"Del" something.

449
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:09,112
Del Valle? Was that his name?

450
00:43:09,149 --> 00:43:12,209
Yeah, that's him.

451
00:43:12,253 --> 00:43:13,845
Who is he?

452
00:43:13,887 --> 00:43:17,186
He's a Cuban.
Very angry Cuban.

453
00:43:17,224 --> 00:43:19,624
Some people think he's a patriot,

454
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:21,093
other think he's a criminal.

455
00:43:21,128 --> 00:43:23,756
I guess that'd depend on your point of view.

456
00:43:23,797 --> 00:43:25,321
That's right.

457
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:27,334
That's exactly right.

458
00:43:27,368 --> 00:43:29,598
You need to go now.

459
00:43:29,637 --> 00:43:32,868
See you tomorrow.

460
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:37,036
Adam, if you see my husband again,

461
00:43:37,077 --> 00:43:39,204
go in the other direction.

462
00:43:58,465 --> 00:43:59,796
Oval Office.

463
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:02,267
This is Catherine Caswell.
Can you put me through, please?

464
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:05,101
One moment, please.

465
00:44:05,139 --> 00:44:08,108
I'm sorry, Ms. Caswell,
the president is on the phone.

466
00:44:08,142 --> 00:44:09,166
I'll wait.

467
00:44:09,209 --> 00:44:11,006
It may take some time.

468
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:12,512
It's important.

469
00:44:12,546 --> 00:44:15,811
Well I believe he will be on the phone longer than you are willing to wait.

470
00:44:15,849 --> 00:44:17,339
May I take a message?

471
00:44:17,384 --> 00:44:19,181
No. No, no message.

472
00:44:23,424 --> 00:44:26,154
Just boast...

473
00:44:26,193 --> 00:44:27,888
Don't fuck this up, Jack.

474
00:44:27,928 --> 00:44:29,623
This was the night when Cuban prisoners

475
00:44:29,663 --> 00:44:32,461
finally came back from the Bay of Pigs.

476
00:44:32,499 --> 00:44:35,662
They flew into Miami after 20 months of captivity

477
00:44:35,703 --> 00:44:38,501
Finally freed by Fidel Castro

478
00:44:38,539 --> 00:44:42,202
for a ransom of $ 53 million
in food and medicines.

479
00:44:42,242 --> 00:44:44,870
How will these returning prisoners be absorbed

480
00:44:44,912 --> 00:44:48,006
into the restless Cuban-American community?

481
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:49,345
Adam,

482
00:44:49,383 --> 00:44:52,113
hurry up, he'll here be any minute.

483
00:44:59,026 --> 00:45:00,755
Doofus.

484
00:45:07,134 --> 00:45:08,829
Walter's driving you.

485
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:11,099
- Walter?
- Jason's dad.

486
00:45:11,138 --> 00:45:15,006
We'll be home late so just, get yourself to bed

487
00:45:15,042 --> 00:45:17,806
And if anyone, and I mean anyone

488
00:45:17,845 --> 00:45:20,473
is drinking at this party, I want you out of there.

489
00:45:20,514 --> 00:45:22,038
Have Jason call his father.

490
00:45:22,082 --> 00:45:23,549
Ok, mom.

491
00:45:23,584 --> 00:45:25,643
And don't think I won't find about it mister

492
00:45:25,686 --> 00:45:27,278
because I will. Clear?

493
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:28,583
Clear.

494
00:45:30,724 --> 00:45:31,713
Bye, Dad.

495
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:35,588
Bye, son.

496
00:45:37,398 --> 00:45:38,524
Adam...

497
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,727
Have fun!

498
00:45:46,173 --> 00:45:47,231
Jimmy, cut the shit.

499
00:45:47,274 --> 00:45:48,263
What?

500
00:45:48,308 --> 00:45:49,969
Too scared to play.

501
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:51,136
Am not.

502
00:45:51,178 --> 00:45:53,703
Shut up and sit down.

503
00:45:53,747 --> 00:45:54,907
Ready?

504
00:46:00,087 --> 00:46:01,782
Adam, see that you get ready.

505
00:46:01,822 --> 00:46:03,483
Adam...

506
00:46:03,524 --> 00:46:05,287
Here we go...

507
00:46:09,696 --> 00:46:10,856
Damn it, Jimmy.

508
00:46:10,898 --> 00:46:11,887
What?

509
00:46:11,932 --> 00:46:15,095
Such a boy.

510
00:46:15,135 --> 00:46:17,501
Faith, one minute.

511
00:46:17,538 --> 00:46:20,029
60 long seconds.

512
00:46:20,073 --> 00:46:28,748
Adam and Faith.
Adam and Faith.

513
00:46:28,782 --> 00:46:30,374
And Adam Faith.

514
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:37,380
60, 59, 58, 57, 56...

515
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:39,915
French, right?

516
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,120
Right.

517
00:46:48,435 --> 00:46:50,198
You got your tooth fixed.

518
00:46:50,237 --> 00:46:52,398
- Yeah.
- I can tell.

519
00:46:58,078 --> 00:46:59,568
Adam.

520
00:47:10,624 --> 00:47:11,613
Faith.

521
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:19,760
Adam Stafford's an asshole.

522
00:48:08,315 --> 00:48:09,680
Are you okay?

523
00:48:09,716 --> 00:48:12,014
I'm planting.

524
00:48:12,052 --> 00:48:14,816
I thought you said we had to wait till after the rain?

525
00:48:16,189 --> 00:48:19,022
After, during, whatever.

526
00:48:20,994 --> 00:48:22,325
You must be cold.

527
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:28,324
You have no idea...

528
00:48:30,871 --> 00:48:32,702
Why is the music so loud?

529
00:48:32,739 --> 00:48:34,707
I was painting.

530
00:48:34,741 --> 00:48:37,107
I can hear it from across the street.

531
00:48:39,446 --> 00:48:41,175
Want one?

532
00:48:41,214 --> 00:48:42,476
Sure.

533
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:01,697
You should go home.

534
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:04,927
I wanna paint with you.

535
00:49:09,743 --> 00:49:11,404
So let's paint.

536
00:49:48,749 --> 00:49:51,980
What do you think?

537
00:49:59,493 --> 00:50:02,018
Not bad.

538
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:10,265
Not bad...

539
00:50:16,843 --> 00:50:18,504
Form is dead.

540
00:50:18,545 --> 00:50:20,536
That's right.

541
00:51:46,333 --> 00:51:47,994
I think I'm done.

542
00:52:33,246 --> 00:52:35,214
Texas? For Thanksgiving?

543
00:52:35,248 --> 00:52:36,579
I have to go.

544
00:52:38,852 --> 00:52:41,377
If I don't go, then I'm not gonna get a raise.

545
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:42,683
You know they like it when you're out there...

546
00:52:42,722 --> 00:52:44,656
...doing things, I know Mike.

547
00:52:44,691 --> 00:52:47,159
It's just...

548
00:52:52,432 --> 00:52:54,457
Adam is...

549
00:52:57,470 --> 00:52:59,028
I can't do it alone.

550
00:53:00,707 --> 00:53:03,904
And Texas... I mean Dallas is a shithole.

551
00:53:03,944 --> 00:53:07,607
It'll just be for a few days.

552
00:53:09,115 --> 00:53:12,141
And I will try to make it home for the Thanksgiving supper.

553
00:53:17,424 --> 00:53:19,255
Well. I'm gonna go wake him up.

554
00:53:19,292 --> 00:53:20,850
He sleeps like the dead these days.

555
00:53:20,894 --> 00:53:22,794
It's hormones. Probably slumming through the roof

556
00:53:22,829 --> 00:53:25,696
at their party last night.

557
00:53:28,902 --> 00:53:30,233
Adam, time to get...

558
00:53:31,838 --> 00:53:35,535
Mike.
Mike, get up here.

559
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:40,440
Look at this.

560
00:53:41,982 --> 00:53:43,142
Hi, Dad.

561
00:53:43,183 --> 00:53:48,211
What, am I supposed to do about this?
What?

562
00:53:50,624 --> 00:53:52,785
It's not that big of a deal, Mom.

563
00:53:52,826 --> 00:53:57,490
You have paint all over you!

564
00:53:57,530 --> 00:53:59,020
In the shower, right now!

565
00:53:59,065 --> 00:54:01,795
Do not come out until every speck of paint is gone.

566
00:54:01,835 --> 00:54:05,168
And then we'll discuss cleaning your room.

567
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:06,729
Okay, mom.

568
00:54:06,773 --> 00:54:08,172
Now!

569
00:54:28,161 --> 00:54:30,254
It's that woman,
Catherine Caswell.

570
00:54:30,297 --> 00:54:33,061
This has got to stop Mike.
This has got to stop.

571
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:35,624
Alright, I'll talk to her this afternoon.

572
00:54:35,669 --> 00:54:38,069
You will talk to her now. Right now.

573
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:39,469
- Addie...
- Now.

574
00:54:39,506 --> 00:54:41,337
Alright, just let me go finish the...

575
00:54:41,374 --> 00:54:43,865
Now!

576
00:54:55,588 --> 00:54:56,577
Hello.
- Hi.

577
00:54:56,623 --> 00:54:59,023
I'm uh...

578
00:54:59,059 --> 00:55:00,890
Mike Stafford,
with The Star, I know?

579
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:04,363
I quite enjoyed your last piece on Dr. King.

580
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:09,858
Though... you didn't exactly seem symphatetic, did you?

581
00:55:09,903 --> 00:55:12,167
Carver, Lucian Carver.

582
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:16,005
The Lucian Carver?

583
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:17,907
Fame is fleeting,

584
00:55:17,944 --> 00:55:21,277
But in Washington we take what we can get.

585
00:55:21,314 --> 00:55:23,282
Won't you come in?

586
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:24,715
Please.

587
00:55:24,751 --> 00:55:28,653
A little early for company, isn't it, Lucian?

588
00:55:28,688 --> 00:55:30,155
Best behaviour, my dear.

589
00:55:30,190 --> 00:55:33,648
This is your neighbor,
Mike Stafford.

590
00:55:33,693 --> 00:55:34,682
Drink?

591
00:55:34,728 --> 00:55:37,390
It's a little early...

592
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:39,193
Should you have a drink,
Catherine?

593
00:55:39,232 --> 00:55:41,200
It's my house, Michael.

594
00:55:41,234 --> 00:55:43,634
Have a drink.

595
00:55:46,673 --> 00:55:48,664
Vodka.

596
00:55:48,708 --> 00:55:49,800
Rocks.

597
00:56:05,058 --> 00:56:06,650
Jesus, Lucian,
don't play with him.

598
00:56:06,693 --> 00:56:09,423
Just give him a drink.

599
00:56:09,462 --> 00:56:10,486
How's a boy?

600
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,623
Boy?

601
00:56:14,367 --> 00:56:16,164
Your son, Adam.

602
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,803
How is he?

603
00:56:18,838 --> 00:56:21,864
Uh, he's fine.

604
00:56:21,908 --> 00:56:23,842
He's great. The usual.

605
00:56:23,877 --> 00:56:26,311
Good! Good.

606
00:56:27,847 --> 00:56:30,645
That's what we all work for, isn't it?

607
00:56:30,683 --> 00:56:31,775
The children.

608
00:56:31,818 --> 00:56:34,878
The future.

609
00:56:34,921 --> 00:56:36,286
I suppose so.

610
00:56:36,322 --> 00:56:38,449
How was your childhood, Lucian?

611
00:56:38,491 --> 00:56:41,722
Somehow I don't see you laughing
and playing in the meadows.

612
00:56:46,066 --> 00:56:47,795
It was fine.

613
00:56:47,834 --> 00:56:49,699
Great.

614
00:56:49,736 --> 00:56:50,760
The usual.

615
00:56:53,773 --> 00:56:54,865
Mike,

616
00:56:54,908 --> 00:56:58,810
is this a social visit or did you actually want something?

617
00:56:58,845 --> 00:57:01,837
No... uh, yes, actually
it has to do with Adam.

618
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:06,648
Addie, my wife, she worries
maybe too much,

619
00:57:06,686 --> 00:57:09,416
but she worries about how much time he's been spending over here

620
00:57:09,456 --> 00:57:12,186
and he's starting to neglect his school work.

621
00:57:12,225 --> 00:57:16,992
And the thing with the... the paint this morning...

622
00:57:17,030 --> 00:57:20,397
If your wife wants him to
stop working for me

623
00:57:20,433 --> 00:57:22,025
consider it done.

624
00:57:22,068 --> 00:57:23,092
Simple as that?

625
00:57:23,136 --> 00:57:25,104
Simple as that.

626
00:57:25,138 --> 00:57:26,935
It sure was a pleasure to meet you, Mike.

627
00:57:26,973 --> 00:57:29,134
I'll be looking forward to you next piece.

628
00:57:30,143 --> 00:57:32,509
Yes, great.

629
00:57:32,545 --> 00:57:34,479
Thanks.

630
00:57:36,149 --> 00:57:37,810
Have fun in Texas!

631
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:41,810
Nice to meet you both.

632
00:57:47,327 --> 00:57:48,851
You don't have to scare him.

633
00:57:48,895 --> 00:57:51,864
I suppose not.

634
00:57:51,898 --> 00:57:53,957
But you enjoyed it.

635
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,731
There are some perks that come with the job

636
00:57:57,770 --> 00:57:59,601
That I do admit.

637
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:01,698
Scaring people?

638
00:58:01,741 --> 00:58:04,869
Forcing them to do things they don't wanna do?

639
00:58:04,911 --> 00:58:07,675
Sometimes what seems like
the worst choice,

640
00:58:07,714 --> 00:58:09,614
is actually the best.

641
00:58:13,219 --> 00:58:15,881
There's nothing I can do, Lucian.

642
00:58:15,922 --> 00:58:20,382
Catherine, your friend Jack
won't talk to me,

643
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:23,827
won't in fact talk to anyone inside the agency.

644
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:26,923
You're our only connection
to the Oval Office.

645
00:58:26,966 --> 00:58:29,332
He's made it abundantly clear:

646
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:32,361
no talking,

647
00:58:32,405 --> 00:58:34,464
no fucking,

648
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:36,737
no nothing.
It's over.

649
00:58:36,776 --> 00:58:39,074
- I need to warn you.
- About what?

650
00:58:39,112 --> 00:58:41,376
The situation is very fluid.

651
00:58:41,414 --> 00:58:43,848
If he refuses to deal with Cuba,

652
00:58:43,883 --> 00:58:46,579
then Cuba is going to deal with him.

653
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:48,052
What's that supposed to mean?

654
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:49,645
There is pressure on me too...

655
00:58:53,826 --> 00:58:55,123
He could be in danger.

656
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:57,595
He's the president,
for God's sake.

657
00:58:57,630 --> 00:59:00,463
He's a man and men make mistakes

658
00:59:00,500 --> 00:59:03,526
which they have to own up to. And correct them.

659
00:59:03,570 --> 00:59:06,164
Things have to change,
Catherine,

660
00:59:06,206 --> 00:59:09,141
or else things will really change.

661
00:59:10,777 --> 00:59:13,302
It's all a game of chess isn't it?

662
00:59:13,346 --> 00:59:16,747
Playing out the pawns in you head.

663
00:59:18,451 --> 00:59:21,420
Should I sacrifice the rook? Or the king?

664
00:59:24,924 --> 00:59:27,893
Will you sacrifice me?

665
00:59:27,927 --> 00:59:30,657
Catherine, I'm your son's godfather.

666
00:59:30,697 --> 00:59:33,495
My son is dead.

667
00:59:33,533 --> 00:59:34,659
Where does that leave you?

668
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:35,690
He was a lovely boy.

669
00:59:35,735 --> 00:59:37,703
- Graham was...
- Get out!

670
01:00:27,687 --> 01:00:29,746
This is Catherine Caswell.
Is he...

671
01:00:32,425 --> 01:00:34,086
No, no message.

672
01:00:36,029 --> 01:00:38,964
Carver. Lucian Carver.
Adrienne, he knew Adam's name.

673
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:40,966
He knew what I've been writing, he knew I'm going to Texas.

674
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,433
He's with the C.I.A.?

675
01:00:42,468 --> 01:00:45,232
Yeah, he's with C.I.A. the way that Stalin
was with the Communist Party.

676
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:48,104
He is the C.I.A.: special ops,
Castro, Lumumba, all of it.

677
01:00:48,141 --> 01:00:50,234
What is uh, what's for breakfast?

678
01:00:50,276 --> 01:00:51,641
Sit your ass down.

679
01:00:51,678 --> 01:00:53,339
- Dad, I...
- Sit!

680
01:00:56,749 --> 01:00:59,343
Okay, number one,
you're gonna have no more contact

681
01:00:59,385 --> 01:01:02,252
with that Caswell woman, none,
zero, zilch, ever.

682
01:01:02,288 --> 01:01:04,449
- Dad...
- Number two, you're grounded.

683
01:01:04,490 --> 01:01:06,390
- Why?
- Because I said so.

684
01:01:06,426 --> 01:01:07,893
And number three,
while I'm gone,

685
01:01:07,927 --> 01:01:09,554
your mother's gonna be working from home

686
01:01:09,595 --> 01:01:11,586
and you're gonna be at school or you're gonna be here

687
01:01:11,631 --> 01:01:12,825
nowhere elsewhere,
clear?

688
01:01:12,865 --> 01:01:13,991
What happened?

689
01:01:14,033 --> 01:01:16,934
School, here
nowhere else.

690
01:01:16,969 --> 01:01:18,436
Clear?

691
01:01:19,972 --> 01:01:21,303
Clear.

692
01:01:23,910 --> 01:01:26,105
Eggs ok?

693
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:27,874
Eggs it is.

694
01:02:50,163 --> 01:02:51,152
May I help you, madam?

695
01:02:51,197 --> 01:02:52,630
Catherine Caswell.

696
01:02:52,665 --> 01:02:54,326
Yes, madam.

697
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,133
I'm sorry, Mrs. Caswell.

698
01:03:00,173 --> 01:03:02,641
The personal list,
I'm sure I'm here.

699
01:03:02,675 --> 01:03:04,040
I'm sorry, Mrs. Caswell,

700
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:06,601
it doesn't appear to be there anymore.

701
01:03:10,349 --> 01:03:11,441
Would you take a bullet?

702
01:03:11,484 --> 01:03:13,042
Madam?

703
01:03:13,085 --> 01:03:14,916
For the president.

704
01:03:14,954 --> 01:03:16,251
Would you take a bullet?

705
01:03:16,289 --> 01:03:18,052
I'm a soldier, madam.

706
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:22,550
Just following orders?
Do your duty?

707
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:24,460
Yes, madam.

708
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:19,545
Fuck do you want?

709
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,286
Nothing, my ball.

710
01:04:23,322 --> 01:04:25,950
Got your ball, right?

711
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:26,981
Yes.

712
01:05:39,632 --> 01:05:44,467
because there was fear in Dallas...

713
01:05:44,503 --> 01:05:47,267
that there might be a demonstration

714
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:49,331
that will embarass the president,

715
01:05:49,375 --> 01:05:52,003
because it was only on October 24

716
01:05:52,044 --> 01:05:53,909
that our Ambassador to the United Nations

717
01:05:53,946 --> 01:05:57,143
Adlai Stevenson,
was assaulted in Dallas

718
01:05:57,183 --> 01:05:59,276
leaving a dinner meeting there.

719
01:06:02,121 --> 01:06:05,648
From Dallas, Texas
the flash, apparently official:

720
01:06:05,691 --> 01:06:07,682
President Kennedy died

721
01:06:07,727 --> 01:06:11,322
at 1:00 p. m.
central standard time,

722
01:06:11,364 --> 01:06:15,858
2:00 eastern standard time,
some 38 minutes ago.

723
01:06:15,901 --> 01:06:19,098
Killed...

724
01:06:19,138 --> 01:06:21,606
They killed him...

725
01:06:21,641 --> 01:06:26,078
Vice President Johnson
has left a hospital in Dallas,

726
01:06:26,112 --> 01:06:29,946
we do not know to where he has proceeded.

727
01:06:29,982 --> 01:06:33,645
presumably he will be taking the Oval Office shortly

728
01:06:33,686 --> 01:06:38,589
and become the 36th
president of the United States.

729
01:06:43,496 --> 01:06:46,932
President Kennedy at the Dulles airport this morning

730
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:50,299
where cheering waving..

731
01:08:12,752 --> 01:08:14,549
Stop.

732
01:08:14,587 --> 01:08:16,919
Bugs...

733
01:08:16,956 --> 01:08:19,789
You're gonna hurt them.

734
01:08:23,028 --> 01:08:26,555
November 22,
and my garden is blossoming.

735
01:08:31,704 --> 01:08:34,070
Police have been looking for a white man,

736
01:08:34,106 --> 01:08:36,540
approximately 30 years of age

737
01:08:36,575 --> 01:08:40,033
135 pounds, slender built.

738
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:41,706
It seems that this man
has shot the president

739
01:08:41,747 --> 01:08:43,908
with 30-30 rifle.

740
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:49,448
It's not my fault.

741
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,857
Adam.

742
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:36,829
Don't touch me.

743
01:09:36,869 --> 01:09:39,099
I'm sorry...

744
01:09:39,138 --> 01:09:40,127
Get out.

745
01:09:40,172 --> 01:09:41,799
- Catherine, I...
- No.

746
01:09:41,841 --> 01:09:43,035
Get out, you little shit.

747
01:10:02,094 --> 01:10:03,584
Mom?

748
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,792
It's alright.

749
01:10:09,835 --> 01:10:14,397
Everything's gonna be fine.

750
01:10:43,769 --> 01:10:45,202
How bad was it?

751
01:10:45,237 --> 01:10:48,673
Well when he came around the corner,

752
01:10:48,707 --> 01:10:50,572
wind was blowing, people were talking

753
01:10:50,609 --> 01:10:54,204
laughing, waiting,

754
01:10:54,246 --> 01:10:56,646
Then his head snapped back

755
01:10:56,682 --> 01:10:58,172
then forward

756
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:01,846
Jackie climbed over the trunk like she's looking for something

757
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,184
and the cars drove away.

758
01:11:03,222 --> 01:11:05,247
- God...
- I gotta get back to the office.

759
01:11:05,291 --> 01:11:07,088
But you've just got here 10 minutes ago.

760
01:11:07,126 --> 01:11:10,095
Oswald hired a lawyer.
I'll be there all night.

761
01:11:11,130 --> 01:11:12,392
It must have been horrible.

762
01:11:12,431 --> 01:11:13,420
Yeah, it was.

763
01:11:16,602 --> 01:11:19,332
At least it's over.

764
01:11:19,371 --> 01:11:21,839
Thank God for small favors.

765
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:25,774
I'll us, see you buddy.

766
01:11:41,727 --> 01:11:43,490
Oh, hello.

767
01:11:43,529 --> 01:11:47,056
I just... I was wondering if I might come in for a moment.

768
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:50,432
No, I don't think so.

769
01:11:50,469 --> 01:11:54,098
I just wanted to make sure
that Adam is alright.

770
01:11:54,139 --> 01:11:55,766
He's fine.

771
01:11:57,176 --> 01:11:59,406
I think he has something of mine.

772
01:11:59,445 --> 01:12:01,572
Well I'll make sure that I ask him.

773
01:12:01,613 --> 01:12:03,513
Okay.

774
01:12:09,688 --> 01:12:10,882
Upstairs.

775
01:12:10,923 --> 01:12:12,914
- I just want...
- Now.

776
01:12:28,273 --> 01:12:30,434
Oh, I have to agree with you.

777
01:12:30,476 --> 01:12:32,774
Fuck the glass,
go straight for the bottle.

778
01:12:32,811 --> 01:12:34,438
Just leave me alone.

779
01:12:37,983 --> 01:12:40,281
I just wanted to check on you,

780
01:12:40,319 --> 01:12:43,720
make sure you're okay.

781
01:12:43,756 --> 01:12:45,587
Where did you find Ruby?

782
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:48,787
He a friend of Del Valle's?

783
01:12:50,863 --> 01:12:52,956
Friend of yours?

784
01:12:54,466 --> 01:12:56,900
It's a little more complicated than that.

785
01:12:56,935 --> 01:12:58,527
Complicated?

786
01:12:58,570 --> 01:13:00,834
He's the president
and he's dead.

787
01:13:00,873 --> 01:13:04,570
Was...
The president. Was.

788
01:13:06,278 --> 01:13:08,269
When I married you...

789
01:13:10,983 --> 01:13:15,386
you were the most idealistic man
I'd ever met.

790
01:13:15,421 --> 01:13:19,687
The man who's gonna change the world.

791
01:13:19,725 --> 01:13:22,285
You've changed the world alright...

792
01:13:22,327 --> 01:13:24,795
You lost every ideal you ever had...

793
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:25,956
Times are different.

794
01:13:25,998 --> 01:13:27,761
Times are the same

795
01:13:28,867 --> 01:13:30,357
you are different.

796
01:13:30,402 --> 01:13:34,031
I didn't lose my ideals,
Catherine.

797
01:13:36,809 --> 01:13:38,276
I've lost you.

798
01:13:45,551 --> 01:13:49,544
He wouldn't listen... not to anybody.

799
01:13:54,526 --> 01:13:56,756
I need the diary, Catherine.

800
01:13:59,898 --> 01:14:02,492
Need a little deniability, Graham?

801
01:14:02,534 --> 01:14:05,935
Point A leads to point B

802
01:14:05,971 --> 01:14:08,439
leads to finger on the trigger?

803
01:14:08,474 --> 01:14:12,308
Just leave me alone.

804
01:14:12,344 --> 01:14:13,368
I am a ex...

805
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:15,437
Ex wife,

806
01:14:16,548 --> 01:14:18,209
Ex mother,

807
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:20,684
Ex lover.

808
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:23,051
- If you don't give it to me...
- I'll talk.

809
01:14:23,088 --> 01:14:27,115
I'll break every rule in your little book.

810
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:32,222
I'll talk about you and Lucian
and Del Valle.

811
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:34,892
Who put your fingers on that trigger?

812
01:14:34,933 --> 01:14:36,798
Lee Harvey Oswald
was the only man

813
01:14:36,835 --> 01:14:38,029
with his finger on the trigger.

814
01:14:38,070 --> 01:14:41,562
Leave me alone and it will stay that way.

815
01:14:44,143 --> 01:14:47,442
Besides, I burned it.

816
01:14:47,479 --> 01:14:49,310
It's not like you.

817
01:14:49,348 --> 01:14:52,943
You got diaries going back to the third grade.

818
01:14:52,985 --> 01:14:54,452
What is like me, Graham?

819
01:14:56,889 --> 01:14:58,447
What am I like?

820
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,830
- Harris was...
- Fuck you.

821
01:15:17,843 --> 01:15:20,539
It wasn't your fault...

822
01:15:23,415 --> 01:15:26,407
I... I've lost you.

823
01:15:28,787 --> 01:15:30,778
And I want you back.

824
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:35,491
We could go away...

825
01:15:37,629 --> 01:15:41,497
start over, just the two of us,
anywhere you want.

826
01:15:41,533 --> 01:15:44,764
I think I'd like that.

827
01:15:44,803 --> 01:15:47,670
But you must give Lucian the diary.

828
01:15:47,706 --> 01:15:51,005
I told you I burned it...

829
01:15:51,043 --> 01:15:55,707
Talk to him, tell him,

830
01:15:55,747 --> 01:15:57,738
and then we'll go whereever you want.

831
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:02,646
I'll think about it.

832
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:04,713
Do...

833
01:16:14,866 --> 01:16:17,027
Do that...

834
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:51,097
I'm leaving.

835
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:52,967
I fully expect never to see you again

836
01:16:53,005 --> 01:16:54,563
and I hope that the feeling is mutual.

837
01:16:54,606 --> 01:16:55,834
Where are you going?

838
01:16:55,874 --> 01:16:57,671
I'll be gone.

839
01:16:57,709 --> 01:17:00,075
You won't have to worry about me anymore, agreed?

840
01:17:00,112 --> 01:17:02,842
The diary poses a problem.

841
01:17:02,881 --> 01:17:05,509
You can't shut up everyone, Lucian.

842
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:08,986
I don't have to, just the people who will talk.

843
01:17:11,323 --> 01:17:14,781
The diary is in a safe place.

844
01:17:14,826 --> 01:17:17,852
Leave me alone
and it will stay there.

845
01:17:20,198 --> 01:17:21,756
I just love a good mystery.

846
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:23,267
I mean it, Lucian.

847
01:17:23,302 --> 01:17:25,862
I wonder where it could be,
that's the question.

848
01:17:25,904 --> 01:17:27,633
No doubt, the safe place.

849
01:17:27,673 --> 01:17:29,163
And who knows...

850
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:32,738
you might even give it someone.

851
01:17:32,778 --> 01:17:37,147
The safest place, the place I would never think to look.

852
01:17:37,182 --> 01:17:39,844
I wonder where that could be.

853
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:42,683
Who that could be.

854
01:17:44,356 --> 01:17:45,755
You wouldn't...

855
01:17:45,791 --> 01:17:50,524
Catherine, I would do anything I had to
anything at all.

856
01:18:03,942 --> 01:18:06,604
And to bring the point home

857
01:18:06,645 --> 01:18:08,772
he stood before that horrible wall

858
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:16,653
and declared to the world:
"Ich bin ein Berliner".

859
01:18:16,688 --> 01:18:17,677
We are all...

860
01:18:17,723 --> 01:18:19,782
Jelly dougnuts.

861
01:18:21,293 --> 01:18:22,692
Excuse me?

862
01:18:22,728 --> 01:18:25,526
"Berliner", he pronounced it wrong.

863
01:18:25,564 --> 01:18:28,089
He said we're all jelly dougnuts.

864
01:18:28,133 --> 01:18:30,101
Is that a joke?

865
01:18:30,135 --> 01:18:31,659
No, sister.

866
01:18:31,703 --> 01:18:33,170
Stand up.

867
01:18:34,406 --> 01:18:36,874
Come here.

868
01:18:40,712 --> 01:18:42,703
Hold out your hand.

869
01:18:44,850 --> 01:18:47,375
John F. Kennedy
was the greatest president

870
01:18:47,419 --> 01:18:49,546
that this country will ever know.

871
01:18:50,422 --> 01:18:52,390
A Catholic

872
01:18:52,424 --> 01:18:54,722
a man with a vision for the future.

873
01:18:55,794 --> 01:18:58,558
I will not tolerate jokes at his expense.

874
01:18:58,597 --> 01:18:59,757
I wasn't trying...

875
01:18:59,798 --> 01:19:02,164
A great man has been taken from us.

876
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,897
Now go... and you pray.

877
01:19:05,937 --> 01:19:08,929
Pray hard.

878
01:19:27,125 --> 01:19:28,285
Adam.

879
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:37,631
What are you doing here?

880
01:19:37,669 --> 01:19:40,160
I told them I was your aunt.

881
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:52,311
I need it back.

882
01:19:52,350 --> 01:19:53,442
What?

883
01:19:53,485 --> 01:19:54,918
What do you think?

884
01:19:57,556 --> 01:19:58,682
I'm sorry I...

885
01:19:58,723 --> 01:20:02,921
Don't be sorry,
just give it back.

886
01:20:02,961 --> 01:20:05,088
It's at home.

887
01:20:05,130 --> 01:20:08,657
Bring it to me then.
Okay?

888
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:13,863
After school, meet me at the steps at 3:30. Okay?
- Okay.

889
01:20:17,609 --> 01:20:20,635
I'm going away for a little while.

890
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:22,647
Where?

891
01:20:22,681 --> 01:20:24,774
I don't know.

892
01:20:24,816 --> 01:20:26,784
India, maybe.

893
01:20:26,818 --> 01:20:30,914
Some place exotic and foreign,

894
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:34,255
where I can't understand the language.

895
01:20:34,292 --> 01:20:36,055
Why?

896
01:20:36,094 --> 01:20:38,756
Because I can't...

897
01:20:42,067 --> 01:20:44,501
Life is about meaning.

898
01:20:44,536 --> 01:20:50,566
You know, finding things in life that have meaning.

899
01:20:50,609 --> 01:20:54,067
Children, art...

900
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:56,478
love.

901
01:20:56,515 --> 01:20:59,814
Well I don't have anything of that anymore.

902
01:20:59,851 --> 01:21:01,785
You have me.

903
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:03,617
I know I do.

904
01:21:03,655 --> 01:21:07,955
But sometimes, one person
isn't enough.

905
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:11,759
You put all your desires and your dreams into them and then...

906
01:21:11,796 --> 01:21:16,358
...they're gone.

907
01:21:18,970 --> 01:21:20,335
If I was older...

908
01:21:20,372 --> 01:21:21,634
Then you wouldn't be you.

909
01:21:24,643 --> 01:21:25,803
Hope...

910
01:21:27,946 --> 01:21:31,712
It's something that gets lost as you get older...

911
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:36,449
I need to find it again.

912
01:21:37,756 --> 01:21:40,589
Is that some sort of life lesson or something?

913
01:21:43,962 --> 01:21:45,623
Something like that.

914
01:21:55,206 --> 01:21:57,265
3:30, the steps.

915
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:26,904
Graham, it's me.

916
01:22:26,938 --> 01:22:28,769
I'll have it this afternoon.

917
01:22:31,142 --> 01:22:33,872
Graham, I'm happy we're going away.

918
01:23:05,310 --> 01:23:06,607
You're home early.

919
01:23:08,880 --> 01:23:10,905
So are you.

920
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:12,644
Is everything okay, buddy?

921
01:23:12,684 --> 01:23:14,413
Why was he here?

922
01:23:14,452 --> 01:23:16,249
Who?

923
01:23:16,287 --> 01:23:18,915
The trenchcoat.
That guy...

924
01:23:18,957 --> 01:23:22,859
Well he's uh an old friend of your mom's and mine and he uh...

925
01:23:38,143 --> 01:23:40,077
Where is it?
What did you do with it?

926
01:23:40,111 --> 01:23:42,739
There are some things that don't make sense when you're a kid.

927
01:23:42,781 --> 01:23:43,975
She wants it back.

928
01:23:44,015 --> 01:23:45,039
I'm sure that she does.

929
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,311
I said I'll give it back.

930
01:23:46,351 --> 01:23:48,478
When you're older you... you'll understand.

931
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,455
I am older, I do understand.

932
01:23:51,489 --> 01:23:52,717
Adam.

933
01:23:52,757 --> 01:23:54,418
You told me the truth when it suits you.

934
01:23:54,459 --> 01:23:56,154
You lie to me for my own good?

935
01:23:56,194 --> 01:23:59,254
Catherine has never lied to me,
not once.

936
01:23:59,297 --> 01:24:00,958
I'm sorry, Adam.

937
01:24:02,767 --> 01:24:04,325
You are my father...

938
01:24:04,369 --> 01:24:08,635
You're supposed to do the right thing... for me.

939
01:24:10,241 --> 01:24:11,572
I did.

940
01:24:12,744 --> 01:24:15,269
Adam...

941
01:24:24,789 --> 01:24:26,256
That's mine.

942
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:27,758
Actually... it's not.

943
01:24:27,792 --> 01:24:29,783
It's not yours either.

944
01:24:31,429 --> 01:24:33,420
You're absolutely right.

945
01:24:40,071 --> 01:24:42,596
Adam.

946
01:24:45,477 --> 01:24:47,741
Catherine's had a full life.

947
01:24:47,779 --> 01:24:51,078
Art, love, intrigue...

948
01:24:52,517 --> 01:24:55,008
Sometimes, with a life like that

949
01:24:55,053 --> 01:24:58,819
it starts to get confusing.

950
01:24:58,857 --> 01:25:01,792
Catherine was confused.

951
01:25:01,826 --> 01:25:04,056
The diary said that.

952
01:25:07,899 --> 01:25:10,060
Where is she?

953
01:25:13,605 --> 01:25:15,129
Isn't she waiting for you?

954
01:27:09,254 --> 01:27:12,189
Bobby said you were a fag.

955
01:27:12,223 --> 01:27:13,451
Good for him.

956
01:27:13,491 --> 01:27:16,221
He said that you offered
to suck his dick for a quarter.

957
01:27:16,261 --> 01:27:18,491
So?

958
01:27:20,798 --> 01:27:22,527
So what are you're gonna do about it?

959
01:27:29,874 --> 01:27:31,034
He said you were gonna suck...

960
01:27:31,075 --> 01:27:32,167
You're the fag!

961
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:34,075
- Asshole!
- What?

962
01:27:34,112 --> 01:27:35,101
Pussy!
