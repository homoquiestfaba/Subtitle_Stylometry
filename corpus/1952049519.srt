2
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,920
Hey, Ray.
Your wife get you that hat?

3
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,189
Something wrong with it?

4
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,953
Nothing that pissing
on it won't cure.

5
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,749
Maybe we ought
to form a circle and do it.

6
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,632
- Hi.
- Hi.

7
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,590
We were flying over the gorge,
and Cas spotted him.

8
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,155
I got 20/15 vision.

9
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,634
Pilot called in
and told the authority.

10
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,432
He's an Indian.

11
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,559
I'm Harold Kleinman.

12
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,717
What were you doing
way out here, Harold?

13
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,349
We're amateur archaeologists.

14
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:13,674
We left the wives in Santa Fe hoping
to find this ancient "Anastazi"...

15
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,195
Anasazi.

16
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,115
Guess you don't find
many bodies out here, huh?

17
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,396
No, we sure don't.

18
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,158
- What do you think, Bert?
- He's dead.

19
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,992
Why would anyone come way out here
to kill himself?

20
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,596
Maybe his wife bought him a new hat.

21
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,831
I won't be positive
without an autopsy.

22
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,990
Hi. How you doing?

23
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,151
You bring
these tourists out here?

24
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,392
Just trying to keep them
from finding any arrowheads.

25
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,790
- Ray Dolezal.
- Delmar Blackwater.

26
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,110
- Don't touch the car.
HAROLD: Okay. Sorry.

27
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,312
- Navajo?
- Mescalero Apache.

28
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,593
Bloodthirstiest red bastards
this side of the Rio Brazos.

29
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,950
I was kind of hoping
for that scalp.

30
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,358
Let's get this bad boy out of here.
He's starting to smell ripe.

31
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,954
If you need any more pens, just tell
me. I sell novelty pens...

32
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,152
...imprinted with the message
of your choice.

33
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,119
CAS:
Holy shit!

34
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,710
Ray, you're not actually
going to tag that...

35
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,514
...and report it as evidence,
are you? Ray?

36
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,430
- What stopped that bike, Ben?
- I don't know.

37
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,910
Gravity?

38
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,078
Is that real money?

39
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,233
- Uh, yeah.
- Gee, that's a lot.

40
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,360
There's got to be $ 1000 there, Dad.

41
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,798
What you looking at?

42
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,833
Look, Ace, go tell Mom
I'll be home real soon.

43
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:35,119
- I got more work to do.
- Okay. See you later, Dad.

44
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,952
Okay.

45
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,549
This is Deputy Sheriff
Ray Dolezal, Torrance County...

46
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,352
...4- 3-9er-2-7-7.

47
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,393
I'd like a trace
and status on a '90 T-Bird...

at 412-5607.

51
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,149
I'd appreciate it if you
could expedite this. Thanks.

52
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,195
Maybe the <i>federales</i> can I.D. Him
and get him out of here.

53
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,034
Maybe I won't even
have to cut him open.

54
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,955
That briefcase could be
$20,000 lighter, Ray.

55
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,997
Nobody'd know
we didn't find it that way.

56
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,673
Was it
a self-inflicted wound?

57
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,595
There's no reward for being
so black-and-white ethical.

58
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,400
Was it a self-inflicted wound,
Bert?

59
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,352
Rug fuzz.

60
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,159
Here. Take a look.

61
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,158
- Ugly rug.
- Butt-ugly rug.

62
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,830
Longhorn Ranch Motel.

63
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,675
Paid cash up front
for the first night.

64
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,990
Had this big old wad
of bills.

65
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,313
That's what fooled me,
that big wad of cash he had.

66
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,159
I figured he could stand good
for the balance.

67
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,352
That's a $63 mistake,
isn't it?

68
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,231
How'd you know
it was my rug, anyway?

69
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,469
RAY:
You see him go?

70
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,477
HOTEL MANAGER: Didn't see him at all
after he checked in.

71
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,790
I'm not the nosy type.

72
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,839
Did this Mr. Spenser
make any calls?

73
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,032
If he did, he didn't make them
from the room.

74
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:41,392
We got this deal. For $4.00
you can make unlimited local calls...

75
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,756
...but he passed on it.
- Did he have a car?

76
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,349
He said he did.
I never seen it.

77
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,990
We usually clean these rooms up
almost every day...

78
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,596
...but Mr. Spenser put "Do
Not Disturb" on the door.

79
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,070
You probably saw it
when we come in.

80
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,993
If a customer wants privacy,
he gets it.

81
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,232
Decorate these rooms yourself,
Mr. Peterson?

82
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,599
No. I brought a fairy over
from Albuquerque. He did it.

83
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,957
I couldn't do this.
I'm colorblind.

84
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,954
- There's been a fire in there.
- What?

85
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,515
- Don't touch anything.
- No, sir.

86
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,953
Jesus Christ, what's
he been doing in here?

87
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,276
My Lord.

88
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,555
This look like
teeth marks to you?

89
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,039
Well, maybe.

90
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,352
- Teeth marks?
- Yeah, I think so.

91
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,715
You got a hell of an imagination,
Raymond. Let's go.

92

Got this John Doe
up your butt now, don't you?

93
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,598
Going to drive us crazy
trying to figure it out.

94
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:02,276
Ruin my Saturday afternoon
in front of the TV.

95
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,599
Guy's in trouble, in a motel
room with half a million...

96
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:11,231
...scared, writing on everything,
making desperation calls.

97
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,957
He covers his trail: Burns his
clothes, swallows that paper.

98
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:20,391
That happens in the morning,
and he's dead by noon.

99
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,797
Maybe that piece of paper
wasn't digested.

100
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,355
Intestinal gases. The ever-Ioving
death fart of a warthog.

101
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,156
All we got are two names:
"Goodman"...

102
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,960
...and a date written on
a fast-food wrapper...

103
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,191
...kind of looks
like an appointment:

104
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,716
"Noreen."
Who the hell is Noreen?

105
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,754
Ease off. You're as persistent
as a dog with two dicks.

106
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,157
You'll owe me for this one.
Promise you that.

107
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,556
Looks like a radish.
They in season?

108
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,756
Oh, cut it out, Bert.

109
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,877
And here's a carrot.

110
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,550
Garbanzo beans.

111
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,474
This may be putrefied lettuce.

112
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,188
Must've been a salad bar.

113
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,678
There's a sorrowful last act
for a desperate man.

114
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,470
Hey, maybe Noreen was with him.

115
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,473
Maybe she had
a big burger with fries.

116
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,109
Maybe Mr. Goodman had apple pie.

117
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,153
Yeah, it's all starting
to make sense now.

118
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,557
We'll call it
"The Big Lunch."

119
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,992
Wait, what is...?

120
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,550
Goddamn. This looks like paper.

121
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,075
It's that kind of waxy paper
they wrap hamburgers in.

122
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,199
It's got about a 200-year half-life.
Something's written on it.

123
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,671
- What's it say?
- It's smeared.

124
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,515
Numbers?

125
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,188
- Numbers.
- Son of a bitch.

126
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,993
Seven digits doesn't mean
it's a phone number.

127
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,751
<i>We're sorry. The number you've</i>
<i>reached is not in serv...</i>

128
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,799
Maybe it's in Utah.

129
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,554
Motel didn't have a
long-distance record.

130
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,957
He used a credit card
or billed another number.

131
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,111
<i>We're sorry...</i>

132
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,553
- What's the area code in Texas?
- They have five.

133
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,309
You are one tenacious S.O.B.
You calling all 50 states?

134
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,715
Maybe that's not a six,
but a zero.

135
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,753
Holy unrelenting bastard.

- You're from the FBI?
- Yes.

00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,113
Our prime suspect in this
theft had an accomplice.

311
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:34,394
We know your husband found our suspect
dead, along with our money.

00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,792
Your husband's disappeared and
we can't find the accomplice.

313
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:42,112
My husband's trying to find
who the dead man was.

314
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,794
- If he calls...
- I'll tell him you want to talk.

315
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,076
That is all you want?

316
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,756
Here's my card. I realize
you want to protect him...

317
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,396
...but think about one thing:
Half a million dollars.

318
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,077
It's a lot of temptation.

319
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,158
They use the same clay...

320
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,029
...that Indians used to make pots
a thousand years ago.

321
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,075
- Worried about your money?
- I want to talk about it.

322
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,996
It's in a safety deposit box
along there with mine.

323
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,949
I was thinking...
Maybe we should reconsider.

324
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,749
Sorry the girls got rough,
but it's microelectronics.

325
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,155
We live in the age of the body wire.

326
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:40,159
It's understandable
we got a little paranoid.

327
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:44,751
I personally feel that it's
all about trust.

328
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,872
You trusted me
with your half-million dollars.

329
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,669
So naturally,
I'm inclined to trust you.

330
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:54,593
Lane said you'd deliver,
and you did.

331
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,152
Most guys wouldn't trust me.

332
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,351
So it was a test?

333
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,750
What did Lane tell you about me?

334
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,758
Nothing.

335
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,158
What did Lane tell you about me?

336
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,349
Nothing.

00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,752
You see? It's trust.
It's all we got. It's all we need.

338
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,228
You're not what I expected.

339
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,075
How's that?

340
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:31,637
From what Lane said, I expected
a fancy package...

341
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,394
...sort of a fast-talking,
slow-walking...

342
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,478
...mohaired-Sam
kind of a thing.

343
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:41,190
You show up in your cowboy hat
and I thought:

344
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,960
"I hooked up with Andy of Mayberry."

345
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,994
If you're not comfortable with me,
let's call the deal off.

346
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,312
- You give the money back.
- Do I seem edgy?

347
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,553
I quit smoking
about a week ago...

348
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,677
...it's been like boring
a wild hair up my ass.

349
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,913
I can't do anything right.
Let me just chill out.

350
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,109
We'll relax.

351
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,989
You put up 500,000,
I put up 500,000.

352
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,552
- We're partners. We're all locked in.
- Right.

353
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,830
Are we expecting someone?

354
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,873
Well, yeah. Lane.

355
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,395
- Lane?
- She was a little concerned...

356
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:31,031
...when she didn't hear from you.
Thought maybe you backed out.

357
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:36,718
Here she is. Here comes Lane.
Here's our girl.

358
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,038
Hi, honey.

359
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:45,632
- Hope I didn't hold you up.
- Just wanted to see Bobby squirm.

360
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,517
Well, where did you disappear
to last week?

361
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,676
Well, you know.

362
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,957
You could have called.

363
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,679
Yeah.

364
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,755
Well...

365
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,158
Let's sit down.

366
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,957
When Gorman said he was
meeting you face to face...

367
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,594
...I had to see it with my own eyes.

368
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,957
I thought perhaps something
had gone wrong.

369
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:29,990
- Obviously not.
- No. Just personal business.

370
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,914
Gorman, you owe me
a finder's fee.

371
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,351
I'll take care of you
when the deal goes through.

372
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:41,553
I've got to confirm
my transportation.

373
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:46,311
Don't let her bulldoze you. She's
used to getting what she wants.

374
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,514
So...

375
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,953
...Bob.

376
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,793
Who are you really?

377
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,350
Bob Spenser. Really.

378
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,359
- The other one lied?
- Must've been.

379
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:12,756
So where is
the other Bob Spenser now?

380
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,599
He's dead.

381
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,949
He's dead?

382
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,273
You could blow me
out of the water right here.

383
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,239
We both know it.
But since you haven't...

384
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,797
...you're waiting for the deal
so you can get your fee from Lennox.

385
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,558
Am I right?

386
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:37,390
[OTHER LINE RINGS]

387
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,429
MAN:
<i>Hello?</i>

388
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:46,393
- Did you kill him?
- Would it matter?

389
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,153
- Did you?
- No.

390
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,919
We're all set.

391
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,789
Can you give us a ride?

392
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,235
- I can drive.
- I'll do it.

393
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,635
Why drive when one can be driven?

394
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,677
That's one of my rules.

395
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,190
Hey, Bobby, you like helicopters?

396
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,068
Helicopters?

397
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,158
Come on. Get in the front.

398
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,151
This is Bob Spenser.

399
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,754
You might wanna buckle up there, Bob.

400
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,596
Mr. Lennox.

401
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,876
Colonel Bedrosian, Gorman Lennox.

402
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,117
- This is my partner, Bob Spenser.
- Hi, Bob.

403
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,880
Let's get inside, it's noisy here.

404
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,915
Ever been to White Sands before?

405
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,310
No, I sure haven't.

406
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,909
It's not sand. It's gypsum.

407
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:01,079
Some kind of prehistoric
underground lake.

408
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,314
A keepsake.
Don't tell anybody where you got it.

409
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,273
Taking sand is illegal.

410
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,719
Something to remember White Sands by.

411
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,709
I'd like to take a reconnaissance
of that briefcase.

412
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,076
Money talks, bullshit walks.

413
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,799
Be my guest.

414
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,271
Let's do some business.

415
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,469
These are M-16s.

416
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,870
Brand spanking new.

417
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,998
Sidearms.

418
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,877
9mm Berettas. Hollow-point ammunition.

419
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:56,996
C-4 explosives.

420
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,471
Claymore mines.

421
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,910
Fléchette grenades.

422
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,709
Now this, gentlemen,
is the AT-4 Viper.

423
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:11,669
This little lady
will knock out a tank at 300 yards.

424
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:16,749
Armor penetration, 11.81 inches plus.

425
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,913
Muzzle velocity, 985 feet per second.

426
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,635
Ground troops like it because
it's light, reliable and easy to use.

427
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:31,911
<i>International Arms</i> magazine
rated this honey four stars.

428
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,110
- It'll fill your basic needs.
- I'm impressed.

429
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,469
This all stuff that wasn't used
during Desert Storm?

430
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,717
Negatory. This is state-of-the-art.

431
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:54,835
- We deal with the Defense Department.
- We'll give you 500 now...

432
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:57,759
...and 500 on delivery.
- Well, no.

433
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,077
There's been a slight increase
in cost.

434
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,350
- Excuse me?
- We want 400,000 more on the back end.

435
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,913
That's bullshit.

436
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,754
If you can't handle the volume, fine.

437
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,270
Fuck it, then. Forget it. No sale.

438
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,589
I ought to turn you in to
the Treasury Department...

439
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,871
...collect a little reward.

440
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,753
- We'll just take our money back.
- We can't do that.

441
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:33,995
We've incurred significant costs.
It's a nonrefundable deposit.

442
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,479
A half million dollars, nonrefundable?

443
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,319
You two cheap, dime-store cowboys...

444
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,156
...squatting on your fat-ass pensions
over in Las Cruces.

445
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:50,117
Black-marketing military hardware to
the highest bidders.

446
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,879
You fuckers make me want to puke.

447
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,875
This is a wash. We're out of here.

448
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,912
- Fuck 'em.
- Wait a second.

449
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,793
Wait a second. This is crazy!

450
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,113
You changed the rules.
How do you expect us to react?

451
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:14,235
We're talking about $400,000
we gotta come up with.

452
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:17,478
It was unavoidable and unforeseen.

453
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,271
You want us to believe
you've had an increase on your end...

454
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,550
...but you're not giving us credit.

455
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,678
You're passing the whole cost onto us.

456
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,270
All right. I tell you what.

457
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,869
We'll eat 150,000.

458
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:46,873
That means you owe us
750 on delivery.

459
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:11,117
Well done, Bobby, but
maybe now you can explain to me...

460
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,710
...how we're gonna find
an extra $250,000.

461
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,270
I thought you did this all the time.

462
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,994
You're the money man, not me.

463
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,313
If I had the money,
I wouldn't need you, now would I?

464
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,472
CLERK:
He's not here. Can I take a message?

465
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,473
Are you ringing the right room?

466
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,114
- It's Bob Spenser.
<i>- Yes, ma 'am.</i>

467
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,873
Can I have his room?

468
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,517
<i>- No, but can I take a message?</i>
- No.

469
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,509
- Good night.
- Good night.

470
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:14,200
I need to wait in his room.

471
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,512
- That's impossible.
- I'm not just anybody.

472
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,472
We have a relationship...

473
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,915
...Bob Spenser and I.

474
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,671
- This is an unpleasant situation.
- I just can't... Good night.

475
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,674
Any messages for Lennox in 306?

476
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,029
No, Mr. Lennox.

477
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,708
Mr. Spenser?

478
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,077
A woman's asking
to be let into your room.

479
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,272
I hope we're practicing
safe sex, Bob.

480
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,078
See you in the morning.

481
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,317
She didn't leave a note.
Her name was Noreen.

482
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,758
- What did she look like?
- You must have walked past her.

483
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,869
- Sort of offbeat, redhead, around 25.
- Okay. Thanks.

484
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:39,998
- You're bad at this.
- We're just watching you.

485
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:42,674
<i>I'm FBI. I work for Meeker.</i>

486
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,074
You didn't warn me
about Lane or Noreen!

487
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:51,272
She might have confused you
with another Bob Spenser.

488
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,995
You wanted to take Artie's ride,
here it is.

489
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,430
We're only halfway home.

490
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:03,435
- Lane's a piece of work, huh?
- What do you mean only halfway home?

491
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:07,673
You're using me as bait
for a sting on Lennox.

492
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,713
I didn't lie.
I just didn't tell you everything.

493
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,873
If you want to bail, I'll understand.

494
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,111
I'll say you lost the money.

495
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:20,069
No, no, I'm in. Let's get this guy.

496
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:24,068
Just don't bullshit me anymore.

497
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,235
All right.

498
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:27,789
The truth is...

499
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:32,272
...I've been trying to bust
Gorman Lennox for five years.

500
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,953
I finally get Artie in place,
and the whole thing blew up.

501
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,675
- Artie was FBI?
- One of my best undercovers.

502
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:43,394
Do you think Lane killed him?

503
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,872
Artie's a suicide.
Stay on track here, Ray.

504
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,150
- I need another $250,000.
- What?

505
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,318
They upped the ante.
I'm taking care of it.

506
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:01,389
You want another 250 grand
on top of the 500 you already lost?

507
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,557
Isn't it your operation?

508
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,433
I'm already out on a limb.
Get serious.

509
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,871
Without that money,
Lennox won't believe me.

510
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,868
If I ran that up the bureau flagpole,
nobody'd salute.

511
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,277
Where the hell
am I supposed to get the money?

512
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,871
Ms. Bodine's got a talent for
finding cash for lost causes.

513
00:44:28,080 --> 00:44:30,833
Damn good at it. Takes a nice cut.

514
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,112
She's getting a finder's fee
for Lennox.

515
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:38,108
Which is what, five grand?
This is a different ball game.

516
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:42,950
The commission on this deal's
got to be over 100 large.

517
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,071
I'm sure she'd go for it.

518
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:49,348
She likes living on the edge,
playing in the gutter...

519
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:53,269
...seducing men of mystery like Artie.

520
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,435
Like you.

521
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,672
You don't have to.
But it's an option.

522
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,077
You can sell it to her somehow.

523
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,277
LANE: How much are we talking about?
LENNOX: $250,000.

524
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,316
Bob and I are already at risk
for a million.

525
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:15,398
We were set to do it ourselves...

526
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:18,712
...but they upped the ante.
- So here we are.

527
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:22,517
We need 250,000 and Bob
thought... Thank you.

528
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,711
Bob thought?

529
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,317
Bob thought you might be willing to
cross the line...

530
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,158
...for the greater good.

531
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,399
I don't get involved in these things.

532
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:39,719
But you'll show us someone
who does...

533
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:44,556
...and take a fee, right?
- You're commenting on my ethics?

534
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,872
The people you're trying
to help are being butchered...

535
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:53,670
...by the government
peace-keeping patrols...

536
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,873
...and blankets and Rice-A-Roni
ain't gonna change that.

537
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,434
Since when have you cared?

538
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,671
All I'm saying is...

539
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,269
...before humanitarian aid can work...

540
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:10,473
...there's got to be some humanity
to give it to.

541
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,393
He almost sounds like he
believes it.

542
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:17,310
Who are you dealing with?

543
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:23,316
If I told you that, you could go
straight to the source...

544
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,115
...and cut me and old Bob
out here completely.

545
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,557
If you were the type
to get involved in this.

546
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,355
Now, we'll give you 10 percent
of the total deal.

547
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,518
That's $ 125,000. That's your share.

548
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,675
We'll allow whatever guarantees
you might need to protect yourself...

549
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:46,914
...and your friends
from old Gorman Lennox.

550
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:48,875
"My friends."

551
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,591
- You mean 10 percent of the front end?
- Right.

552
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,229
So...

553
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,354
...you buy these guns for...

554
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,878
...what? $ 1.25 million?

555
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:09,551
Then you sell them to your
freedom fighters for $3 million.

556
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,116
I think I'd like 10 percent
of the back end.

557
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,920
$300,000. Is that fair, Bob?

558
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,557
You don't care if it's fair
but it's nice of you to ask.

559
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:27,672
I like to be completely up-front.
What about you?

560
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,316
Me? I believe in money.

561
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,996
If you can get it, we'll be friends.

562
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,397
Well? Foreplay's over, Lane.

563
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:41,074
It's time to fuck.

564
00:47:49,080 --> 00:47:51,674
I could do one of my little events.

565
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,556
One of you have to help me
make the sales pitch.

566
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,320
I'd love to stay here tonight...

567
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:05,310
...but unfortunately
I have to go to El Paso.

568
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,750
I'm sure Bob can stay here...

569
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:13,395
...and take care of things.

570
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,436
Bob?

571
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,875
- Hey, Bob. The keys.
- Oh, yeah.

572
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,075
- No, thank you.
- Thanks.

573
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,475
So who did kill Bob Spenser?

574
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,073
How do you know he was killed?
I only said he was dead.

575
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:10,272
How did he die then?

576
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,073
Suicide.

577
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,075
You don't have to be straight
with me. It's okay.

578
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,875
But it doesn't
lend itself to intimacy.

579
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:26,071
We're intimate, aren't we?

580
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,717
The minute you chose to be Spenser
and I went along with it...

581
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,558
...we became intimate.

582
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,798
All right, look.

583
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,918
Maybe this is
a bit of a game to you...

584
00:49:39,120 --> 00:49:43,318
...but if Gorman finds out
you're not Spenser...

585
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,479
Let's just say I want to know
who I'm dealing with.

586
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:52,996
I'm a guy that Bob Spenser could be,
that could be Bob Spenser.

587
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,598
- Works for everyone.
- You're making fun of me.

588
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,519
No.

589
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,718
In another context...

590
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,476
...I could be stable.
I could be married, raise a kid.

591
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,675
Same guy, different story.

592
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:15,674
Which is the guy I'm attracted to?

593
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,109
I don't know.

594
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,079
Either way, I should just trust you?

595
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,675
Yeah.

596
00:50:26,680 --> 00:50:30,070
I'm just being honest.
One of us should try it.

597
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,920
Okay, we're being honest here?

598
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,071
Tell me...

599
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,669
...what's between you and Lennox?

600
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:45,039
It's ancient history.
It's not important.

601
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,395
Trust me.

602
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:52,469
Coffee?

603
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,555
Yeah. Thanks.

604
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:03,598
Great.

605
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,279
Lane, I need...

606
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,479
I need to keep our relationship...

607
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,912
...on a business level.
- For right now, or forever?

608
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,160
You don't want to get involved
with me.

609
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,676
We'll do the deal...

610
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,711
...then I disappear.

611
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,872
I've never met anyone like you.

612
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,709
You're honest...

613
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:35,838
...even when you're lying.

614
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:52,719
- We have a call in the house.
- Tell them to call back.

615
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,354
Hi there! How are you?

616
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,791
- Great to see you. Super party.
- Thanks.

617
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,675
Take it to the table in front.

618
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,075
- Shall we go?
- Oh, sure.

619
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,713
Hello.

620
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:21,279
Nice to see you.

621
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,431
Good.

622
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,516
RAY:
I want to show you something.

623
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,716
It's a letter. Here.

624
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,475
This might give you an idea
of what we're up against.

625
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,878
Here's a pen.

626
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,079
You like horses?

627
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,278
Not especially.
This looks like a good one.

628
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,198
You're right. He is.

629
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,351
We'll ride in the rodeo Friday.

630
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:21,473
You're not the kind of woman
I'd expect in a rodeo.

631
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:25,072
I'm not the kind of woman
you'd expect.

632
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,998
Hold that?

633
00:53:29,240 --> 00:53:30,275
Nice.

634
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,790
Antique?

635
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:37,559
I don't know. Gorman gave it to me.
Could be fake.

636
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,476
How come you knew Spenser
and Lennox didn't?

637
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,116
Spenser found me.

638
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:49,512
Spenser was a sleazy grifter
who said he had a lot of money.

639
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:54,678
I set up a meeting with Gorman
to get him off my back.

640
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,514
They deserved each other.

641
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,558
And there's a finder's fee.

642
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:03,911
Come on, Bob. Look around you.

643
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,720
Do I really need a finder's fee?

644
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,077
No, but 300 grand
from that arms deal...

645
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,556
...could buy you a lot of hay
and Persian rugs.

646
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,194
Lennox and you like this game.

647
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:19,113
You pull in someone like Spenser...

648
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,715
...maybe scam him, maybe not.

649
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:24,315
Maybe you guys are scamming me.

650
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:28,075
You make a pile of money,
come back here...

651
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,716
...and pretend you're interested
in worthy causes.

652
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:35,794
I give the money from these
deals to those who need it.

653
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,591
- 300,000 can do a lot of good.
- Noble.

654
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,116
- I don't have to justify myself.
- No...

655
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,592
...but it's a fine line
separating you and Lennox.

656
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,670
Sometimes that's all you got.

657
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:57,115
You want to know about Gorman?

658
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:59,078
This is the picture:

659
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:02,118
I was 20.
I believed in good and evil...

660
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,477
...and he was the sexiest man
I'd ever seen.

661
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:08,274
He was smart and dangerous.

662
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,875
And that was a huge turn-on.

663
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:15,716
I didn't know any better.
I had a trust fund. I was bored.

664
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,678
One day he came home...

665
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,593
...put a gun to my head
and pulled the trigger.

666
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:24,879
Just to see my face
when I realized it was empty.

667
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,793
What's he doing in your life?

668
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,474
Gorman's like a virus.

669
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:32,711
Once you got him, you got him.

670
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,276
And now you've got him.

671
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,316
But you're not bored anymore, are you?

672
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,870
GREG:
You're chasing your tail here.

673
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:52,550
It's an open-and-shut case.

674
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:56,110
Artie stole from the FBI,
and Artie's dead.

675
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,078
So, what happened?

676
00:55:59,520 --> 00:56:01,272
Artie was a burnout.

677

I should have
got him some professional help.

678

I guess he just decided to
help himself to bureau funds.

679

When he discovered you guys
creeping up on him, he killed himself.

01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,274
...and there's no way out.

850
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:37,754
And then...

851
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:43,556
...I handed him the gun
and said, "You go first, buddy."

852
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,512
And he shot himself.

853
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,831
- I walked to town.
- I'm arresting you for his murder.

854
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:56,915
And they'll believe you.
What picture will they be seeing?

855
01:12:57,160 --> 01:13:01,915
Small-town redneck who possibly
stole money from the FBI...

856
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:06,955
...telling tales about a respected
senior minority agent...

857
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:11,398
...who hasn't so much as a
bug stain on his record.

858
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:13,758
I'm out of the loop.

859
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,830
Artie's dead. Noreen's fingered
you as the accomplice.

860
01:13:19,080 --> 01:13:20,149
She's dead.

861
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:24,228
All you've got is a Polaroid, cowboy!

862
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:25,754
Means nothing!

863
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:29,793
It's just another snapshot.

864
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,397
If I help you bust Lennox,
what happens?

865
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:37,831
Then you're a hero.
You get to go home.

866
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:43,239
I say Artie stole the money. You and me
took a lemon and made lemonade.

867
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:47,311
It's your only move.

868
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,315
You get back to me now, Ray.

869
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,673
I'll be here. Waiting.

870
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,439
[GREG GIGGLES]

871
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:16,313
Lane?

872
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:40,152
What are you doing here?

873
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:43,392
- Have you seen Lane?
- No. You all right?

874
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:47,109
I want to show you something.

875
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:03,953
They made this a working holiday.
Do you believe that?

876
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,919
Our tax dollars, hard at work.

877
01:15:09,720 --> 01:15:12,314
Good always triumphs over evil.

878
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:16,314
Come on. Let's see
how much they know. Hop in.

879
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,114
My number one rule in life...

880
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,918
...is, don't let people intimidate you.

881
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:47,559
Here you go. Payback.

882
01:15:49,880 --> 01:15:54,112
- You are a disappointment.
- I'm working for the FBI.

883
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,915
No, you're not. I know who you are.

884
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,519
I made calls.

885
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:04,038
I know about Greg Meeker
and his pathetic little scam.

886
01:16:04,280 --> 01:16:07,113
I'm C-fucking-IA, Bobby.

887
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,511
Meeker doesn't know shit.
He can't touch me.

888
01:16:13,720 --> 01:16:18,430
They don't tell him that, though.
Officially, I don't exist.

889
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:20,113
I can't.

890
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:24,156
My profit's my reward...

891
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:28,552
...for selfless service to
God and country.

892
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,919
No!

893
01:16:32,480 --> 01:16:35,916
What's the fuck's wrong?
I brought them here for you.

894
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:41,035
They're the only ones
that can connect Artie to you.

895
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,714
- Nobody'll ever know.
- I will.

896
01:16:45,120 --> 01:16:46,314
Yeah?

897
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,313
Well, we're partners.
I'm action and you're money.

898
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:13,158
We could be legendary.

899
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:17,110
This isn't about sides.
This is about confusion.

900
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:20,039
This is about creating enemies.

901
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:22,953
The goddamn world's falling apart.

902
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,112
Peace reigns. Freedom reigns.

903
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,078
Democracy rules.

904
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:32,036
How can we keep
the military/industrial complex...

905
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:36,757
...chugging forward without
clear-cut, pit-faced...

906
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:41,152
...scum-sucking evil
breathing down our neck?

907
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:45,310
Threatening our very shores.

908
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,753
Now, my job is to make sure...

909
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:51,958
...the other side keeps on fighting.

910
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,352
Whatever side
we're officially not on this year.

911
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,595
But that's water under the bridge.

912
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:03,156
You helped raise the money with Lane.

913
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,755
You came through for me.

914
01:18:06,040 --> 01:18:08,952
It's set up.
We meet them tomorrow.

915
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:10,189
No.

916
01:18:11,560 --> 01:18:14,518
Get the fuck away from me.
You're crazy.

917
01:18:14,920 --> 01:18:16,911
I'm not going anywhere.

918
01:18:20,920 --> 01:18:24,515
Where's the money?
I need the quarter mil.

919
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:27,030
Where is she?
Where is she?!

920
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:31,359
You can't win here, Ray.
Dealer holds the cards.

921
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:35,915
Look, hey, we'll trade Lane
for the cash.

922
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:39,320
She said you had it. See you.

923
01:18:43,480 --> 01:18:45,516
Bury them if you want.

924
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:01,913
Lane?

925
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:05,519
Lane!

926
01:19:21,200 --> 01:19:26,115
ARMS DEALER: <i>Ever been to White Sands?</i>
<i>It's not sand. It's gypsum.</i>

927
01:19:46,360 --> 01:19:48,396
Man, not this noise again!

928
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:54,075
We're going for a little ride.

929
01:21:37,920 --> 01:21:40,309
It's easier if you rip it off.

930
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:43,916
Oh, shit! You son of a bitch!

931
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,634
You'll see the light soon...

932
01:21:46,880 --> 01:21:51,351
...and remember the only way out
is to help me get Lennox!

933
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:56,117
Guess what, Greg? Lennox is CIA.

934
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,193
That's bullshit!

935
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,956
Who the fuck told you that? Ray!

936
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,830
So what if he's CIA?
So what if he's in on Artie's deal?

937
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,551
It's not gonna save your ass!
You're losing it, Ray!

938
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,712
Losing it the same way Artie did!

939
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,753
We both know
what happened to him!

940
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:31,710
The farther you go down that river,
the harder it is to return!

941
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:37,309
You listening to me, Ray?

942
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:44,915
Last night, that call I made?
FBI Internal Affairs in D.C.

943
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:50,029
I said I was Artie's accomplice,
and I'd meet them here.

944
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:51,918
I don't get it.

945
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:58,235
Lennox killed the feds
who think I'm the accomplice.

946
01:22:58,520 --> 01:23:02,354
Anybody could be
Artie's accomplice now, right?

947
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:04,318
Anybody.

948
01:23:05,400 --> 01:23:09,552
- Like you, for instance.
- Oh, man. Look, Ray...

949
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:13,037
- Don't do this!
- I told them to send one guy.

950
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:17,751
Just one, or I'd bolt.
My first concern being the operation.

951
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,912
You know this is not gonna work!

952
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,551
You got lots to think about. Choices.

953
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:30,152
You could try
to explain everything to the FBI.

954
01:23:30,400 --> 01:23:35,030
It's a long shot, but you are
a senior minority agent...

955
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:38,192
...without even a bug stain
on your record.

956
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:42,519
Or you could kill him
and take the money and run.

957
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:58,992
You like choices?

958
01:25:01,200 --> 01:25:03,236
I'm glad you got my clue.

959
01:25:14,760 --> 01:25:17,752
Where's Lane? That was the deal.

960
01:25:18,000 --> 01:25:20,912
She's down the road, by the entrance.

961
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:25,829
- You don't trust me.
- Where's the money?

962
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:30,675
Oh, it's right in there.

963
01:25:37,680 --> 01:25:42,708
- Why'd you put it in there?
- I wanted a chance to get away.

964
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,315
You're so goddamn cynical.

965
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:56,315
I thought you quit smoking.

966
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,919
Looks like I have no willpower.

967
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:06,117
You sure the money's in the case?

968
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:09,756
I thought we had a mutual trust here.

969
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,318
You're making me sad.

970
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:21,112
Maybe we can hook up again someday.

971
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:23,920
No. Too wild for me.

972
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,111
It's a bunch of bureaucratic bullshit.

973
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:34,314
They have an agenda, so do I.
But you know what? It works.

974
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,915
Yeah, it's the CIA way.

975
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:41,318
It's beautiful.
It keeps corruption to a minimum.

976
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:46,351
I'm gonna go while you're in there.

977
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:48,319
Oh, I know.

978
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:43,189
Ray!

979
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:48,589
Ray!

980
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,757
Very fucking funny!

981
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:55,039
Who the fuck else
is out there, huh? Ray!

982
01:28:41,480 --> 01:28:45,314
I heard gunshots. He's dead, isn't he?

983
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:47,549
Yeah.

984
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,917
I guess that's it.

985
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:30,715
You can give
the money back to the donors...

986
01:29:30,960 --> 01:29:33,474
...or a cause you believe in.

987
01:29:36,280 --> 01:29:37,793
I thought I had.

988
01:29:42,480 --> 01:29:46,075
- Are you in love with your wife?
- Yeah, I am.

989
01:29:49,280 --> 01:29:51,316
Are you in love with me?

990
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:53,712
I could have been.

991
01:30:02,160 --> 01:30:05,152
- Is this yours?
- New hat, yeah.

992
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:09,154
- Molly bought it for my birthday.
- Molly...

993
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,274
Let's see.

994
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:16,833
Looks good on you.

995
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:30,318
Be careful.

996
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:28,915
We found our money
in the trunk of the car.

997
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,189
- Half a million.
- Also footprints into the dunes.

998
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,791
No!
