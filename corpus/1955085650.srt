35
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,416
           Thank you!           

36
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:28,853
       Please, sit, I--         
       I would never ask        

37
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:30,688
        you to stand.           
        I can't believe         

38
00:01:30,724 --> 00:01:32,256
        you all stood...        

39
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:36,427
     of your own volition,      
     thank you.                 

40
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:38,930
     That's never happened.     

41
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:40,832
     (cheering, whistling)      

42
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:46,604
       Thank you so much        
       for being here.          

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,106
     This has been              
     an insane year for me.     

44
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,176
  I started out-- I made        
  two New Year's resolutions.   

45
00:01:52,211 --> 00:01:54,378
          I, uh...              
          Number one,           

46
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,180
  I wanted to catfish someone.  

47
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:59,250
       Did it, loved it,        
       recommend it.            

48
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,786
           (laughter)           

49
00:02:01,821 --> 00:02:03,555
        And number two          
        was to this year        

50
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,557
      just once take off        
      a pair of underwear       

51
00:02:05,592 --> 00:02:08,259
   and have it not look         
   like I blew my nose in it.   
   Now...                       

52
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:15,132
          Same? Same?           

53
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,403
    No? You're                  
    kind of like, "No, no."     

54
00:02:20,707 --> 00:02:22,239
   So you find a pair           
   of underwear on the floor    

55
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:24,742
        and you're like,        
        "How do I know          
        if I wore it?"          

56
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,978
  Please, you know. You know.   

57
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:28,813
           (laughter)           

58
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:31,348
           She knows.           

59
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,951
     I'm like,                  
     "Oh, cool they filmed      

60
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,486
     "Charlotte's Web           
     in my underwear, wow.      

61
00:02:37,023 --> 00:02:39,290
     'Salutations'? Okay."      

62
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,697
   I don't know why the guys    
   look grossed out.            

63
00:02:45,732 --> 00:02:50,167
   Your underwear looks like    
   a coal miner wiped           
   their brow...                

64
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:53,004
   (laughs) at the end          
   of a shift, a long shift.    

65
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,476
  So my name is Amy,            
  and I'm at the Apollo. Um...  

66
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,746
           (cheering)           
             Right?             

67
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:04,749
 You guys all look like         
 you're from this neighborhood. 

68
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:06,150
           (laughter)           

69
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:10,054
     So... Here's how           
     I wound up here. Okay?     

70
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,523
   Let me just catch you up.    

71
00:03:12,558 --> 00:03:16,427
       My two front teeth       
       didn't fall out          

72
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,429
  until I was in fifth grade.   

73
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:20,665
           (laughter)           

74
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,970
         Which is late.         

75
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:28,006
           (laughter)           

76
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:31,809
      And that same week,       
      I got my period.          

77
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:34,946
  (cheers, scattered applause)  

78
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:37,982
        Which is early!         

79
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:40,217
      So I was just like        
      this jack-o'-lantern      

80
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:43,587
   with tits walking around,    
   like... (groaning)           

81
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,589
           (groaning)           

82
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:53,197
    Trick or treat. (groans)    

83
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,935
   I was like Pinocchio         
   transitioning to a donkey.   

84
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:01,305
      I was like,               
      "Hee-haw!" (groans)       

85
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,207
           (laughter)           

86
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:07,845
 And I had one of those         
 really cool moms who told me,  

87
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,414
    "You don't need to shave    
    above your knee,            

88
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,217
      just... here down."       

89
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:18,156
 So here up,                    
 I was just a werewolf, just... 

90
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:22,193
    Mr. Tumnus here to here.    

91
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:26,898
      Benicio Del Toro...       

92
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,801
       beneath my torso.        

93
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,005
  I'm so happy to be filming    
  my special here in New York.  

94
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,607
        I grew up here,         
        I was born here,        

95
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:39,210
        um, did my first        
        everything here,        

96
00:04:39,245 --> 00:04:42,046
       um, still no anal...     
           (laughter)           

97
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,183
   But I just love New York,    

98
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:47,618
     'cause it's a town         
     where I can get laid.      

99
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:53,157
  Like, I can catch a "D" here  
  kinda whenevs, yeah.          

100
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:58,395
 And, uh, I was in LA           
 for a little while, and, um... 

101
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,364
      can't, can't there.       

102
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,200
             Uh...              

103
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:04,736
      Just in case you've       
      never been to LA,         

104
00:05:04,771 --> 00:05:08,106
   it is, um, filled with       
   the most beautiful people    

105
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,241
    from all over the world.    

106
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:13,111
 So, picture the most beautiful 
 girl in your high school,      

107
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,046
     like the one               
     that you wanted to be.     

108
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:16,981
     Okay? I'm talking          
     to the guys right now.     

109
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,850
           (laughter)           

110
00:05:18,885 --> 00:05:20,818
    And everybody was like,     
    "You're too pretty          

111
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:24,521
     for Buffalo, Brittany,     
     go to LA. Go."             

112
00:05:24,557 --> 00:05:27,024
     Everyone is hot there.     

113
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,459
        Everybody, okay.        

114
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,595
  I saw a guy, he was cleaning  
  up a Pizza Hut bathroom.      

115
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,364
      I would have paid         
      this guy to fuck me.      

116
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,868
       I would have paid        
       him good money.          

117
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:40,004
     I don't-- People don't     
     even see me there.         

118
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:41,372
      Like, I just--            
      They 're just like,       

119
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,608
   "Is that a fat tumbleweed?   
   Like, what's..."             

120
00:05:44,644 --> 00:05:46,778
      My body type there,       
      they're like--            

121
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:49,613
        My arms register        
        as legs there.          

122
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,582
        They're just...         

123
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,284
      They're like,             
      "Is that an octopus?      

124
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,319
      I don't understand."      

125
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,155
      And my legs register      
      as firewood.              

126
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,023
      They're just like...      

127
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:02,093
     like, "Why is the BFG      
     on Sunset?" Just...        

128
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:08,199
 It got to the point--          
 I was in LA, I was so excited. 

129
00:06:08,234 --> 00:06:10,601
     Somebody tweeted           
     about another actress.     

130
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:13,037
      They were like,           
      "She looks like           
      a fat Amy Schumer,"       

131
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,239
     and I was like, "Yes!"     

132
00:06:15,275 --> 00:06:17,175
           (laughter)           

133
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,877
         "It's not me!"         

134
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,612
      It's so insanely---       

135
00:06:21,647 --> 00:06:23,580
  Like, if I go                 
  on an audition in New York,   

136
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:26,517
 it's for, like, the cute girl  
 you didn't notice              

137
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,653
  'cause she was, like,         
  wearing khakis or something.  

138
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,622
     Like, "There can't be      
     a pussy under there,       

139
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:33,590
       those are khakis."       

140
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:36,160
           (laughter)           

141
00:06:36,196 --> 00:06:37,428
   How would that even work?    

142
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,198
   But then in LA,              
   I'll be in a waiting room,   

143
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,465
      they're like, um,         
      "Amy, it says here--      

144
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:43,400
 "Are you reading for the girl  
 getting gastric bypass?        

145
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,037
       Is that correct?"        

146
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,972
  "Amy, who did you-- Did you   
  play Gilbert Grape's mom?     

147
00:06:48,007 --> 00:06:50,041
      I can't place you."       

148
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:52,009
           (laughter)           

149
00:06:54,013 --> 00:06:55,546
        I'm like, "No."         
        They're like,           

150
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,881
    "Okay, well,                
    you didn't get the part.    

151
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,983
 "But do you want us to put     
 a hose on you, keep you moist, 

152
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:01,118
  so we can return              
  you to the sea, Blackfish?"   

153
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:02,619
           (laughter)           

154
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:05,189
        It's fucked up.         

155
00:07:05,225 --> 00:07:08,625
  And that's not how it is      
  for the dudes at all, okay?   

156
00:07:08,661 --> 00:07:10,962
 Like, I just happened          
 to see the movie "Zookeeper."  

157
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:12,629
  Did you ever see that movie?  

158
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,665
      Okay, if you didn't,      
      don't, all right?         

159
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,668
     Don't see that. But...     

160
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,839
    So "Zookeeper" is about     
    talking animals, okay?      

161
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:25,276
      And the male              
      romantic lead is...       

162
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,845
 (in sultry voice) Kevin James. 

163
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,546
             Um...              

164
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:31,115
       (breathes heavily)       

165
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,250
      Oh, my God, I know.       

166
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,985
      Is it wet in here,        
      ladies, or is it us?      

167
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,853
            (moans)             
           (laughter)           

168
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:37,688
      The real King James.      

169
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,258
       And, uh... (moans)       

170
00:07:41,827 --> 00:07:45,562
 And Kevin James is dating      
 a beautiful, blonde skeleton.  

171
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:48,565
             And...             
           (laughter)           

172
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:52,103
  And he's sad because          
  sometimes she's mean to him.  

173
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,872
          And then...           

174
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:57,741
       the girl who is          
       in love with him,        

175
00:07:57,777 --> 00:08:01,045
  who he doesn't notice,        
  who's been there all along,   

176
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,280
    waiting in the wings,       

177
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,716
      is Rosario Dawson...      

178
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:11,188
     arguably the most          
     fuckable actress ever.     

179
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:14,258
   Rosario Dawson is just,      
   like, working at the zoo,    

180
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:16,093
      just, like, sweeping      
      up koala shit.            

181
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,963
 Like,                          
 "Please fuck me, Kevin James." 

182
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,998
           (laughter)           

183
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:26,804
  "Why won't Kevin James        
  give me his dick?" (whines)   

184
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,306
         And he's like,         

185
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:31,108
      "Ew, you're wearing       
      khakis, never."           

186
00:08:31,144 --> 00:08:33,744
           (laughter)           

187
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:36,314
     Like, that movie's         
     about talking animals.     

188
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:39,716
 There is a beaver              
 and a penguin that are friends 

189
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,518
     and talk about opening     
     a bed and breakfast.       

190
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,656
   But that's not               
   the most unrealistic part    
   of that movie.               

191
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,025
          It's Rosario          
          pretending--          

192
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,627
    She should get an Oscar     
    for that fucking movie.     

193
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,297
    Let's see Meryl do that.    

194
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:54,832
       I dare you, Meryl.       

195
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:59,270
   Pretend like                 
   you're dying to have         
   Kevin James deep dick you.   

196
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:01,872
        I... I dare you.        

197
00:09:01,907 --> 00:09:03,574
  It's fucked up in Hollywood.  

198
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,844
 That's why I-- I wrote a movie 
 last year and I, uh...         

199
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:10,681
       (audience cheers)        
       Yeah, thank you.         

200
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,916
       Thanks. I did it.        

201
00:09:12,952 --> 00:09:15,353
     And I went like that,      
     and then send,             

202
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:19,357
   and I'm a hero and, uh...    

203
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,492
 But they were like,            
 "We're gonna make your movie." 

204
00:09:21,527 --> 00:09:22,860
        And I was like,         
        "Oh, my God,            

205
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,762
     this is so great,          
     'cause I love money."      

206
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:27,764
           (laughter)           
             Um...              

207
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,102
 So I wrote this movie and, uh, 

208
00:09:31,137 --> 00:09:33,371
     and I just assumed         
     that they would cast,      

209
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,506
       like, a beautiful        
       model-y actress          

210
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,209
 to play the lead role and, uh, 

211
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,944
  You know, like                
  a Blake Lively or like a...   

212
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,280
        Sofa Vergara...        

213
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,516
      Verge... Verchair...      

214
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,851
      Vergina... and, uh,       

215
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:51,022
    and then I'd be on set      
    just as, like, a writer     

216
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,324
    with, like, a messy bun     
    and a laptop like,          

217
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,326
      "Um, Miss Lively,         
      the line's actually       

218
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:56,627
       'My pussy hurts.'"       

219
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,263
             And...             
           (laughter)           

220
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:05,102
    And she'd be like,          
    "Why is there               
    a garden gnome on set?"     

221
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:06,437
             And, um...         

222
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,741
 And I would just, like,        
 stumble back to my sad office. 

223
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,910
     But... they were like,     

224
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:15,312
      "No, we want you          
      to be in the movie."      

225
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,614
       And I was like,          
       "Oh, my God. Me?"        

226
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,050
     They were like, "Yes."     

227
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,185
      They were like,           
      "We just need you         
      to do three things.       

228
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,954
    "One, just be yourself.     

229
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,791
        "Two, have fun.         

230
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,462
 And three, stop eating food."  

231
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:34,131
        And I was like,         
        "Wait a minute!         

232
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:36,633
    I'm sorry, don't people     
    need food to live?"         

233
00:10:36,669 --> 00:10:38,902
        They were like,         
        "That's a myth."        

234
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:42,206
    So, I was like, "Okay."     

235
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,807
      And they were like,       
      "No. You promise?"        

236
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:46,210
          I was like,           
          "You guys...          

237
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,844
        "like, I don't          
        even like food.         

238
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,413
     "I was just eating it      
     'cause I was bored.        

239
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:50,548
          "Like, ugh.           

240
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,950
  Who wants to, like, chew      
  and eat food all the time?"   

241
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:56,220
           Me. I do.            

242
00:10:56,255 --> 00:11:00,491
     It turns out,              
     I need food and, uh...     

243
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,793
   So they got me a trainer.    

244
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,028
     And I've never             
     had a trainer before,      

245
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,030
  and this guy is the trainer.  

246
00:11:07,066 --> 00:11:10,867
  He's like, trains all         
  the Hemsworthses and, um...   

247
00:11:10,903 --> 00:11:12,903
           (laughter)           

248
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:16,407
   ...like, Megan Fox           
   and, like, an actual fox.    

249
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:18,675
      Like, everything          
      that you wanna fuck,      

250
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:22,079
    this guy has gotten         
    his mitts on, and, uh...    

251
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:25,216
     And so, we're meeting      
     for the first time,        

252
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,652
 and I can really picture him,  
 like, it was like slow-mo.     

253
00:11:28,687 --> 00:11:31,722
  I saw him see me and wince.   

254
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:34,625
       Like, "Ooh. Um..."       

255
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:37,294
     He wasn't used             
     to this kind of cargo.     

256
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,062
   So, he's walking toward me   

257
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:42,032
    and he's smiling at me,     
    like, trying to be brave    

258
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,667
      like you would for,       
      like, a burn victim.      

259
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,469
       Like, he's like...       

260
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,304
           (laughter)           

261
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:51,509
   "I can see there's a human   
   under there somewhere."      

262
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:54,678
           And, uh...           

263
00:11:54,713 --> 00:11:56,747
    And like, I-- I see him     
    looking at me               

264
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:59,016
  and I know he's, like,        
  assessing what's up with me.  

265
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,784
 So I'm trying to make muscles  

266
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,719
     that, like, my body        
     doesn't even support.      

267
00:12:02,755 --> 00:12:04,054
        I'm just like...        

268
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:06,023
   Like, I look like one        
   of those inflatable things   

269
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,924
       outside a car wash       
       that are like...         

270
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,593
      I'm like... (groans)      

271
00:12:09,629 --> 00:12:11,295
           And, uh...           

272
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,230
           And so...            

273
00:12:13,266 --> 00:12:16,534
 he gives me this,              
 um, this, like, questionnaire. 

274
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,635
       He's like, "Okay.        

275
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,503
    How many drinks             
    do you have in a week?"     

276
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:21,805
    And I'm like-- you know     
    how you get just, like,     

277
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,807
     just once in a while,      
     you're like,               

278
00:12:23,842 --> 00:12:25,909
    "What if I'm just honest    
    for the fuck of it?"        

279
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,378
    Like, "What if I just...    

280
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,946
   What if I keep it real       
   with this guy right now?"    

281
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:33,184
        So, I'm like...         

282
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,585
             "36."              

283
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,521
           (laughter)           

284
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,690
     (cheering, whistling)      

285
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,595
             "36."              

286
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,163
           And, uh...           

287
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,665
 And he's like, "No, alcohol."  

288
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,200
  And I'm like, "No, alcohol."  

289
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,270
             And...             

290
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,572
      And, uh, he's like,       

291
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:57,241
  "All right, take me through   
  what you eat in a day."       

292
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,578
    And he stops me at noon.    

293
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,547
   Like, he had heard enough.   

294
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,182
     He's like, "I get it."     

295
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,717
             So...              

296
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:11,689
   And then he's like,          
   "Okay, well, here's          
   your new diet, all right?    

297
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:14,325
    "So for breakfast,          
    you'll have a smoothie.     

298
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,428
      "And then for lunch,      
      you'll journal            

299
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,162
     "about that smoothie.      

300
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,199
   "And then, you put a peanut  
   under your pillow            

301
00:13:22,235 --> 00:13:24,067
    and you hope                
    you dream about pizza."     

302
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:25,202
        And I'm like...         

303
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:27,605
           (laughter)           

304
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,574
    I'm like, "Um, I kind of    
    have to stop you here.      

305
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:35,246
   "It's sounding like          
   at times I will be hungry.   

306
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,781
             "Um...             

307
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:41,017
  Did I miss a couple           
  of courses in there? Uh..."   

308
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:42,453
  And he had to explain to me,  

309
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:46,089
      like, "No, sometimes      
      people are hungry."       

310
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,191
   And I'm like, "Oh, my God.   
   Well, where are they?        

311
00:13:48,227 --> 00:13:49,627
    Can we bring them food?"    

312
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:52,529
   Like, "I've got some extra   
   stuff in my apartment,       

313
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,633
   like, not a lot--            
   Actually, let's just         
   get them their own food."    

314
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,800
             Um...              

315
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,836
    And, like, that's           
    the secret I found out.     

316
00:13:59,872 --> 00:14:01,472
      Like, that's              
      Hollywood's secret.       

317
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,941
      They don't put food       
      in their faces,           

318
00:14:04,977 --> 00:14:07,844
       and that's not           
       an option for me.        

319
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,913
       Like, I don't know       
       how it was...            

320
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:11,715
    how it was in your house    
    growing up, but in our--    

321
00:14:11,751 --> 00:14:12,916
         in my house,           
         it was, like,          

322
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,952
  you would eat till            
  you were in a lot of pain...  

323
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,922
           (laughter)           

324
00:14:18,957 --> 00:14:21,158
   then you'd take,             
   like, a little breather...   

325
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:26,463
   and you get yourself back    
   in even more pain, right?    

326
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,933
 Like, I was born weighing 150. 

327
00:14:29,968 --> 00:14:31,335
       Like, I just             
       came out swinging.       

328
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,437
 Like, "Give me linguine, Ma!"  

329
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,139
       (laughter, cheers)       

330
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:41,578
     That's how it's been.      

331
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,114
       Like, I have never       
       in my life--             

332
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,149
   I've never said              
   this sentence in my life--   

333
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:49,320
 I've never said, "Oh, my God.  
 I forgot to have lunch today." 

334
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,154
    Like, never in my life.     

335
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,157
  If anything, I've been like,  

336
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,927
   "Oh, shit.                   
   I had two lunches today...   

337
00:14:59,097 --> 00:15:01,131
     that lunch                 
     and that other lunch."     

338
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:02,433
             Um...              

339
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:07,103
    So I was like,              
    "I don't think I can do     
    this not eating thing.      

340
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:10,341
   "What if I... just develop   
   an eating disorder?          

341
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,544
    Like, I'm a white girl.     
    I can do it, you know?"     

342
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,013
       So, I, uh,               
       I made a decision.       

343
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,516
   I was like, "I'm gonna get   
   a late-in-life               
   eating disorder."            

344
00:15:19,552 --> 00:15:21,017
             And...             

345
00:15:21,053 --> 00:15:24,722
     So I binged regularly,     
     and, uh...                 

346
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:27,190
      and then I was like,      
      "Here we go.              

347
00:15:27,226 --> 00:15:30,026
       First day pukin'."       

348
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:33,230
     And... and my body         
     was like, "No, bitch.      

349
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,665
           (laughter)           

350
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,933
  No, we keep our food here."   

351
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:44,074
    It turns out that's not     
    available to everybody.     

352
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,710
       What was available       
       to me was                

353
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:49,813
 popping all the blood vessels  
 in my left eye.                

354
00:15:49,849 --> 00:15:51,548
           (laughter)           

355
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:54,485
             So...              

356
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:59,456
      Not only...               
      was I super bloated,      

357
00:15:59,492 --> 00:16:02,426
  but then I had                
  this weird, dead lizard eye.  

358
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,661
           (laughter)           

359
00:16:06,732 --> 00:16:08,365
        People thought          
        I was an oracle.        

360
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,000
       They were like...        

361
00:16:10,035 --> 00:16:11,735
   asking about their future.   

362
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:13,470
       And I was like,          
       "I'm just hungry.        

363
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:14,905
         "I don't know.         

364
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,973
      I don't know              
      about your future."       

365
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,241
            So I...             

366
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:21,177
 Even from just not drinking,   
 I did, I lost like ten pounds. 

367
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:25,148
  And this trainer acted like   
  he taught Helen Keller        
  how to read.                  

368
00:16:25,183 --> 00:16:29,352
  He was like, "There she is.   
  There's my girl."             

369
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,926
       So I showed up           
       to film this movie       

370
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:39,396
   and I was like,              
   "I think I'm a model now."   

371
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:40,997
       Like, ten--              
       I was seriously--        

372
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,400
    I think a lot               
    of girls are like this.     

373
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:45,502
     I-- We have like           
     a sneaking suspicion,      

374
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,703
       like, in the back        
       of our heads,            

375
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:50,941
  like, "Am I maybe gorgeous?"  

376
00:16:50,976 --> 00:16:53,043
           (laughter)           

377
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,581
    "I think I'm gorgeous."     

378
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,115
           (cheering)           

379
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:00,216
             Right?             

380
00:17:03,388 --> 00:17:06,457
  I'm gorgeous,                 
  but I just haven't stumbled   

381
00:17:06,492 --> 00:17:09,225
      on the right hairdo,      
      you know?                 

382
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,294
   But one day,                 
   on a whim I'll just, like,   

383
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:12,930
  cut bangs                     
  and everybody will be like,   

384
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,397
       "Damn!"                  
       And I'll be like,        

385
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,867
    "Oh, my God, like, treat    
    me the same, you guys."     

386
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,569
           (laughter)           

387
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:24,575
      "I'm the same             
      person under here."       

388
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,743
  And they're like,             
  "We can't, we're too hard,"   

389
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,111
   and I'm like, "I get it."    

390
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:30,681
          But then...           

391
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:34,284
    But then my stunt double    
    was a guy. Um...            

392
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:37,454
           (laughter)           

393
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,123
  I-- I thought I was so cool   
  that I had a stunt double.    

394
00:17:40,158 --> 00:17:41,892
    I was just like--           
    I walked into set like,     

395
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,560
      "Where is she?"           
      and they were like,       

396
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,928
         "That's Troy."         

397
00:17:44,964 --> 00:17:46,964
       And he was dipping       
       and had a beard.         

398
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:49,032
           (laughter)           

399
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:53,103
    I was like, "That's me?"    

400
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,473
        They were like,         
        "That's you!"           

401
00:17:56,509 --> 00:17:58,475
     Totally tried              
     to have sex with him.      

402
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,076
             Um...              

403
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,779
      I'll admit that           
      to you fine people.       

404
00:18:02,815 --> 00:18:05,716
    I learned, and I should     
    have already known this     

405
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,252
 because I've been on the road  
 doing stand up for 11 years,   

406
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,087
       (audience cheers)        
       and-- Thank you.         

407
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,624
     Now I get to be here.      

408
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:18,996
     And I-- This is gonna      
     make some of you gasp.     

409
00:18:19,031 --> 00:18:22,533
    I have never gotten laid    
    after a show, okay?         

410
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:26,202
     I know,                    
     but that is the truth.     

411
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:30,774
  Male stand-ups-- puss as far  
  as the eye can see, okay?     

412
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:35,546
      And female comics--       
      it is not that way.       

413
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,583
      What I'm saying           
      is I'm not in this        
      for the dick, okay?       

414
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,019
       'Cause it--              
       I mean, I would be       

415
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,354
  if it had led to that,        
  but that's not what happens.  

416
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:48,191
 The stunt guy, it's not        
 my fault I tried to fuck him.  

417
00:18:48,226 --> 00:18:50,427
        He was very hot.        

418
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,462
      I'm hot as a guy,         
      it turns out, and...      

419
00:18:52,497 --> 00:18:54,297
           (laughter)           

420
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:56,600
   He was from South Africa,    
   and I'm just, like,          

421
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,402
    such a sucker               
    for an accent, you know?    

422
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:02,439
     Like, an English guy       
     or, like, a deaf guy?      

423
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,808
              Mmm.              
           (laughter)           

424
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,210
              Mmm!              

425
00:19:07,245 --> 00:19:11,314
   That was a test to see       
   if you were bad people...    

426
00:19:11,349 --> 00:19:13,850
           (laughter)           
         which you are.         

427
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:15,185
             Um...              

428
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,620
   I do feel bad about that.    

429
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,655
     My mom's a speech          
     and hearing therapist      
     for the deaf,              

430
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:21,124
   and she's gonna hear that,   
   but they won't.              

431
00:19:21,159 --> 00:19:22,926
             So...              

432
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:24,427
     Cheers, you guys,          
     thanks for coming out.     

433
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,930
     (cheering, whistling)      

434
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,335
        I know that, um,        

435
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,972
   some of you are here         
   by accident and I'm sorry.   

436
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,306
             Uh...              

437
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,642
   The Apollo is a beautiful    
   theater with subscribers,    

438
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:43,179
   so some of you thought       
   you were seeing "Godspell"   
   tonight, but...              

439
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:46,216
  Like, I have no information.  
  I have no...                  

440
00:19:46,251 --> 00:19:49,786
  I don't know what's going on  
  in the news, ever,            
  like, at all.                 

441
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,656
       My friends do.           
       They're very smart       

442
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:55,025
 and they're up to date,        
 and, like, I try to chime in.  

443
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,127
   Like, they were all          
   very upset about Ferguson,   

444
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:00,163
    and I was like,             
    "I know, I can't believe    
    he left the show.           

445
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:04,200
      "Um... I don't know       
      about this new guy.       

446
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,303
    What do you guys think?"    
    And they were like...       

447
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,406
   I kept telling               
   people I was gonna do        
   an ISIS bucket challenge.    

448
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:11,675
           Like, I...           

449
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,046
      I'm doing the UTI         
      challenge right now.      

450
00:20:16,081 --> 00:20:18,181
           Can you...           
           (laughter)           

451
00:20:18,216 --> 00:20:19,549
           Thank you.           

452
00:20:19,584 --> 00:20:20,717
           Thank you.           

453
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:23,620
       (cheers, applause)       

454
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,789
        A UTI, in case          
        you don't know,         

455
00:20:25,824 --> 00:20:27,758
  it is not a college online.   

456
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:32,963
   It is...                     
   a urinary tract infection,   

457
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:37,433
      and, um, I just got       
      my first UTI at 33.       

458
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:39,836
Woman: What?!                   
      Yes--                     
      I made it this far.       

459
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:41,337
      I know,                   
      unbelievable, right?      

460
00:20:41,373 --> 00:20:43,473
      33, first--               
      And nobody tells you      

461
00:20:43,508 --> 00:20:45,075
        how embarrassing        
        it's gonna be           

462
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:47,343
     'cause no one's like,      
     "How'd you get it?"        

463
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,879
  Like, you know how I got it.  

464
00:20:50,615 --> 00:20:52,448
          I had sex...          

465
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:55,786
    and then I was too lazy     
    to pee right after.         

466
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,725
      I chose to lay there,     
      like a cum dumpster,      

467
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,028
            just...             
           (laughter)           

468
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,668
       Just a receptacle.       

469
00:21:11,704 --> 00:21:15,638
   Was I savoring the moment?   
   What was I doing?            

470
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,074
      And I didn't              
      want to use condoms,      

471
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,508
    'cause I'm like,            
    "What if I'm allergic?"     

472
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:20,677
       Like, I don't want       
       to risk, you know?       

473
00:21:24,649 --> 00:21:27,084
     A UTI,                     
     it's so embarrassing,      

474
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,853
 and then everyone's like,      
 "Just drink cranberry juice,"  

475
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:31,955
 and that doesn't work at all.  

476
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,225
   And if you order it,         
   everybody knows what's up.   

477
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,160
       You're, like,            
       at a steakhouse...       

478
00:21:37,196 --> 00:21:40,230
           (laughter)           

479
00:21:40,265 --> 00:21:42,132
  "Yeah, the fillet and, uh...  

480
00:21:42,167 --> 00:21:45,368
   Can I have                   
   a cranberry juice? Um..."    

481
00:21:45,403 --> 00:21:48,839
 The waitress is like,          
 "You want a cranberry juice?"  

482
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,074
    You're like, "Yep, yep."    

483
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:53,309
       She's like, "Why?"       

484
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:55,912
    "'Cause I love it."         
    "No, you're disgusting."    

485
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:01,852
  I got it-- I was sleeping     
  with a guy who's my friend.   

486
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,553
   Having--                     
   Like, friends having sex,    

487
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:05,255
        there's a real          
        sadness to that.        

488
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:07,824
   Like, I don't know           
   if you've experienced it,    

489
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,425
     when, like,                
     two friends are like,      

490
00:22:09,461 --> 00:22:11,194
      "We could stomach         
      fucking each other.       

491
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,796
      We should try that."      

492
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:16,266
  Just, like, hurl your bodies  
  at each other and...          

493
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:18,668
     and you're just, like,     
     thinking about it          
     the whole time, like,      

494
00:22:18,703 --> 00:22:22,538
     "Ugh, I can't believe      
     Luke's eating my pussy     
     right now, like..."        

495
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:25,175
           (laughter)           
       "That's fucking--"       

496
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,610
     And Luke's thinking,       
     "I'm eating Schumer's      
     pussy right now?"          

497
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:31,381
        Like, it's bad.         
        It's all bad.           

498
00:22:31,416 --> 00:22:34,550
        It's really sad.        
        And then...             

499
00:22:34,586 --> 00:22:37,620
      And then, you know,       
      and he was like,          

500
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:39,589
      really worried about      
      getting me pregnant.      

501
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:41,992
   And I'm like, "I was born    
   wearing the NuvaRing,        

502
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,095
  like, I came out ringed up."  

503
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,663
           And, uh...           

504
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,300
      And also, I'm like,       
      "Guess what, Luke?        

505
00:22:50,335 --> 00:22:52,535
       "If I got pregnant       
       with your baby,          

506
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,971
 I would ignore all red lights  

507
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:56,472
    on the way                  
    to Planned Parenthood."     

508
00:22:56,508 --> 00:22:58,708
  Just... (imitates car horn)   

509
00:22:58,743 --> 00:23:01,244
      (laughter, applause)      

510
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,780
     It would look like         
     "Snowpiercer"              
     out my window, just...     

511
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:06,183
        (imitates wind)         

512
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,753
 It's always the guys you would 
 never have a kid with          
 that's like (grunts).          

513
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:13,890
  Like, "I'm not trying         
  to get your seed, thank you.  

514
00:23:13,926 --> 00:23:15,591
      Thank you, though."       

515
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,996
  Yeah, I have no idea          
  what's going on in the news.  

516
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:23,099
     I read about the, um,      
     when the celebrities'      
     photos got hacked.         

517
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:24,301
          I read that.          

518
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:26,703
       Did you guys look        
       at their beautiful       
       little pussies?          

519
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:29,239
   I'm the only one, really?    

520
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:31,908
    I looked at every little    
    pussy I could find.         

521
00:23:31,944 --> 00:23:33,509
           (laughter)           

522
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:38,481
 I wanted to see if they were,  
 like, magical and, like,       
 almond-sized.                  

523
00:23:38,516 --> 00:23:39,950
      Not that mine isn't.      

524
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:42,085
  I mean, you guys,             
  I didn't know                 
  you'd be sitting this close.  

525
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,720
 Like, it's very small, right?  

526
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,122
    It's a-- I have a tiny--    

527
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:48,391
 It's like a Barbie.            
 You can't even find the hole.  

528
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,126
       You're like,             
       "Is there a hole?"       

529
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,863
      Tiny. Even in             
      a light days tampon,      

530
00:23:52,898 --> 00:23:55,498
      I walk around, like,      
      "Ow, ow, ow, ow,          

531
00:23:55,533 --> 00:24:00,370
           ow ,ow...            
           Ooh! Mmm!"           

532
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,307
   No, if I, like, sneeze,      
   that would fall out of me.   

533
00:24:04,343 --> 00:24:05,342
            I, um...            

534
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,645
     At the drugstore,          
     I'm like, "Do you guys     

535
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,249
     have any futons            
     I could maybe borrow?"     

536
00:24:20,092 --> 00:24:23,393
    No. It's normal.            
    I think my pussy's good.    

537
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,895
      Like, people always       
      come back, you know?      

538
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,697
       I've got a good...       
       good return rate.        

539
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:31,634
  Like, I'd know by now         
  if it was, like, jacked up.   

540
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:34,938
 I, uh... I don't know, though. 

541
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,540
    I've never really looked    
    at my pussy, like...        

542
00:24:37,575 --> 00:24:38,841
    but it got into my head.    

543
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:40,210
     "Amy, what does            
     your pussy look like?"     

544
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:42,112
      Um, probably like         
      the mouth of, like,       

545
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,613
     an old lounge singer,      
     there's, like,             

546
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,248
      a cigarette hanging       
      out of it, just...        

547
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:47,083
           (laughter)           

548
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,988
  She's like doing              
  the Charleston and scatting.  

549
00:24:52,024 --> 00:24:54,024
    She's like... (scatting)    

550
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,400
   She calls everybody honey.   

551
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,768
      Just-- I'm guessing.      
      I don't know.             

552
00:25:05,804 --> 00:25:07,203
         It's a guess.          

553
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:12,909
 They're all beautiful,         
 they're all equally beautiful, 

554
00:25:12,945 --> 00:25:14,177
       I believe, but...        

555
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,912
    The reason I don't know     
    what my pussy looks like    

556
00:25:15,948 --> 00:25:18,614
     is because women never     
     look at their vaginas.     

557
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,850
         Like, men,             
         you look down,         

558
00:25:20,885 --> 00:25:22,152
     you're like,               
     "Oh, there's my dick."     

559
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,386
     Well, like, hopefully.     

560
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:24,554
             Um...              

561
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:26,389
           (laughter)           

562
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:28,624
  But, girls, you would need,   
  like, a hand mirror           

563
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,560
   and to do some, like,        
   "Cirque du Soleil" type...   

564
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:34,064
    Like, it's hard to find.    

565
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:36,732
 And then the only time you see 
 it is if you get a bikini wax. 

566
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,735
 And they wax you               
 and then they show it to you,  

567
00:25:39,771 --> 00:25:44,907
  and there is no faster        
  response time in the world.   

568
00:25:46,845 --> 00:25:50,013
    You're just like,           
    "Yep, that looks great!"    

569
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,616
      (laughter, applause)      

570
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:56,286
      "I see it.                
      Yeah, that's great."      

571
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,988
 It's like identifying a body.  

572
00:25:58,023 --> 00:26:00,056
   You're like, "That's her!    

573
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,727
     Yeah, definitely her.      
     Thank you."                

574
00:26:07,199 --> 00:26:10,000
    Right? I don't know         
    any girl that's like...     

575
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:15,238
  "Hmm... Maybe                 
  a little more off the top."   

576
00:26:15,273 --> 00:26:19,009
       No one...                
       No one does that.        

577
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:22,945
   I got a massage recently.    

578
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:27,384
 I hurt my neck doing something 
 that's my business and, um...  

579
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,652
    I know, that's supposed     
    to sound like I was,        

580
00:26:29,687 --> 00:26:33,223
   like, giving a blowjob,      
   but I was honestly opening   
   a jar of salsa con queso.    

581
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,690
     I was like... (grunts)     

582
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,659
           And, um...           

583
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,431
   So that I could suck it      
   off of a cab driver's dick   
   and, uh...                   

584
00:26:41,466 --> 00:26:44,834
      (laughter, applause)      

585
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:46,102
             Never.             

586
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,204
         Uber, yes.             
         Uber... (gags)         

587
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,872
           But, um...           

588
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,707
           (laughter)           

589
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,677
     That's me in an Uber.      

590
00:26:54,712 --> 00:26:56,846
          Mmm... mmm.           
          (giggles)             

591
00:26:58,983 --> 00:27:01,251
        So, my neck hurt,       

592
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,186
 and I looked at this website,  

593
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:06,156
 and it had music               
 and it looked like a nice spa, 

594
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:09,659
     and I realized--           
     realized a little late     

595
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:11,694
     in the game that           
     it was a rub and tug.      

596
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,996
   Now, it is fully my fault.   

597
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,665
      Like, all the signs       
      were there.               

598
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,334
   This is-- It's on me.        
   I'm taking responsibility.   

599
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:21,003
  Like, I had to be buzzed in.  

600
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,807
  Um... I don't know a spa      
  that's like, "Who's there?"   

601
00:27:24,842 --> 00:27:27,843
       Like, they usually       
       let you come             

602
00:27:27,879 --> 00:27:31,948
     and go at your "leis,"     
     and, uh...                 

603
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,050
      There were gold bars      
      on the windows.           

604
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:35,818
       I was like,              
       "Ooh, exclusive."        

605
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:38,688
           And, uh...           
           (laughter)           

606
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,491
   I swear, I got in there      
   and they were like,          
   "Are you law enforcement?"   

607
00:27:41,526 --> 00:27:44,961
 And I was like,                
 "No, but I have been           
 working out more, thank you."  

608
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:48,498
    Uh... And then the girl     
    who came to get me,         

609
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,233
     she was leading            
     the guy before me out      

610
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:53,336
  by the small of his back,     
  which is body language for,   

611
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:58,741
   "That's okay you came        
   on my foot. That's okay."    

612
00:27:58,776 --> 00:28:01,611
           And, uh...           

613
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:04,280
      And then she walked       
      me back to the room       

614
00:28:04,316 --> 00:28:06,916
      like she was walking      
      me through, like,         
      a fun frat party.         

615
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:08,284
     She like--                 
     she's like, "Come on!"     

616
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,320
       She's like, "Woo!"       

617
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:14,491
     And I'm like, "Okay."      

618
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,860
    And then we get in there    
    and that's when I knew,     

619
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:21,831
   because it was just two--    
   It was just a steel table,   

620
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,734
   like-- like you'd examine    
   people on in "Lost..."       

621
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:31,407
     and towels,                
     like, hardened towels.     

622
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,809
      You know the color.       

623
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:37,847
       And... and there         
       was no face cradle       

624
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:41,384
     'cause no one had ever     
     laid facedown before.      

625
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:46,456
        So, uh, I still         
        laid facedown.          

626
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,192
   I was like, "Fuck this,      
   I am not finding out what    
   they do to girls here."      

627
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:52,662
     So I just put              
     my head over the edge.     

628
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:56,232
     And I was really           
     trying to keep things      
     on the up-and-up.          

629
00:28:56,268 --> 00:28:58,234
   I'm like,                    
   "It's just my neck, girl,    

630
00:28:58,270 --> 00:28:59,869
      like, just my neck."      

631
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:01,737
   And she's all upper thigh.   
   She's like,                  

632
00:29:01,773 --> 00:29:03,506
      "Is this your neck?"      

633
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:05,308
           (laughter)           

634
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,213
      I'm like, "You know       
      that's not my neck."      

635
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:12,582
    And then I just kind of     
    accept it into my heart.    

636
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:13,849
          I was like,           

637
00:29:13,885 --> 00:29:17,787
 "Amy, you know you're getting  
 a thumb right in the butthole. 

638
00:29:17,822 --> 00:29:21,924
  "Just accept it. Embrace it.  

639
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,994
      "This is God's plan       
      for you, Amy.             

640
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,163
         " Let it go          

641
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,864
          Let it go "         

642
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,338
   And then, she didn't do it   
   and I was fucking furious.   

643
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:39,141
    Just...                     
    What about my butthole?     

644
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:41,177
            I, uh...            

645
00:29:41,213 --> 00:29:43,179
    I-- I would have let her    
    go down on me, I bet.       

646
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:47,483
   Like... I would let anyone   
   go down on me, actually.     

647
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,018
       Um... you ever           
       think about that?        

648
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:50,687
    Like, sometimes I'll see    
    people on the street,       

649
00:29:50,722 --> 00:29:53,590
   I'm like, "How bad would     
   it get before I said no?"    

650
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,758
     Like, when would I...      

651
00:29:55,793 --> 00:29:59,028
   I see kinda, like, a hot,    
   like, newly homeless dude.   

652
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,665
    Like, I mean, week one,     
    doesn't even have a sign    

653
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,000
    or a dog yet, you know,     
    just, like...               

654
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:07,704
      just got out there.       

655
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,906
      "Yes," I thought.         
      "Yes, that's fine."       

656
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:15,010
     Some family members...     
     like a cousin. Like...     

657
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,280
   Not like a cousin            
   you grew up playing with,    

658
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,648
      like just one that        
      you see at funerals,      

659
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,451
 like that kind of a distance.  

660
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,653
    He could go down on me.     

661
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,489
      Any girl, any girl.       

662
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:28,758
   I mean, I could never        
   go down on a girl, though.   

663
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,126
       I couldn't do it.        

664
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,527
      If a pussy were ever      
      in front of me            

665
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,731
   and it was, like, go time,   
   it would be like             

666
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,666
  I was, like, trying to jump   
  into Double Dutch.            

667
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:37,867
       I would be like...       

668
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:42,505
      (laughter, applause)      

669
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,043
    "I can't.                   
    You're a beautiful girl.    

670
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,879
    "I'm so sorry, I can't.     

671
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:51,781
     Thank you                  
     for braiding my hair."     

672
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:54,884
             Um...              
           (laughter)           

673
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:56,452
      I'm, like, seriously      
      winded from just,         

674
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:59,422
      like, moving my body      
      for two seconds.          

675
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:03,459
 They're like,                  
 "Oh, she's gonna sweat again." 

676
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:05,995
    I, uh, before I left LA,    

677
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,499
      I-- my agent got me       
      courtside seats           
      to a Laker game.          

678
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,601
       And I don't care         
       about basketball,        

679
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,503
     or any sport, at all.      

680
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:16,372
    But courtside, I thought    
    it would be free booze,     

681
00:31:16,408 --> 00:31:18,941
  and it's not, it turns out.   

682
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:21,177
 I'm like, "Do you have to be,  
 like, the point guard          

683
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:24,781
       to get a merlot?         
       This is horrible."       

684
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:30,753
    But I go to the game        
    and I was like,             
    "This is a fancy event.     

685
00:31:30,789 --> 00:31:32,888
     Like, I want to            
     bring it, I want to        
     look great," you know?     

686
00:31:32,924 --> 00:31:34,857
     And I did.                 
     I put on, like, blush,     

687
00:31:34,892 --> 00:31:37,660
    and like...                 
    that's it, but, like...     

688
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,796
           (laughter)           

689
00:31:39,831 --> 00:31:41,897
      Like, so much blush,      
      you know?                 

690
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:45,267
  Like, a lot of blush and...   

691
00:31:46,705 --> 00:31:48,538
   I was really kind of         
   feeling myself, you know?    

692
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:50,406
         I just walk in         
         and I'm like,          

693
00:31:50,442 --> 00:31:53,509
    "Here I am.                 
    Like, feast your eyes,"     

694
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:57,246
     and then the first         
     person I saw was           
     literally Kate Upton.      

695
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:02,218
        And I was like,         
        "Oh, I get it.          

696
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:05,120
     "I'm not a real woman,     

697
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:08,391
      I'm just harvesting       
      organs for one."          

698
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,729
   So if Kate was ever like,    
   "My liver feels weird,"      

699
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,665
   I'd be like, "Well, here,"   
   and then, like, bleed out.   

700
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,770
       And she'd be like,       
       "Do you have             
       anything smaller?"       

701
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:22,872
           And, uh...           

702
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:27,710
     I don't know why my,       
     like, liver's flopping     
     around her hand.           

703
00:32:27,746 --> 00:32:30,813
      So I see Kate Upton       
      and I knew,               

704
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:32,548
       I knew she wanted        
       to talk to me            

705
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,418
    because beautiful girls     
    love funny girls.           

706
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,587
     They think we're           
     like clowns, you know?     

707
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,888
       Like, I just knew.       

708
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:41,023
  She's gonna, like, poke me.   
  Like, "Do your clown thing."  

709
00:32:41,058 --> 00:32:42,392
       And I'm like,            
       "I don't want to."       

710
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,626
             But...             

711
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:49,465
     And funny girls do not     
     want anything to do        

712
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,966
     with beautiful girls.      
     And you guys are like,     

713
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:52,402
    "Amy, but you're both."     
    Oh, my God,                 

714
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,637
     thank you guys             
     for all thinking that.     

715
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,873
 All of you, every one of you,  
 every single one of you,       

716
00:32:56,908 --> 00:32:58,541
   and all my ex-boyfriends.    

717
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:01,143
       (cheers, whistles)       
          Oh, my God.           

718
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:02,845
   Like, you can have it all.   

719
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,414
             Um...              

720
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,683
     I don't like talking       
     to really hot people.      

721
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:11,854
 I'm very grossed out           
 being around someone gorgeous. 

722
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,757
  But my friend talked to her   
  and he was like,              

723
00:33:14,793 --> 00:33:17,192
       "She was actually        
       really funny,"           

724
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,462
  and I was like, "Fuck you."   

725
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,565
       (laughter, cheers)       

726
00:33:26,638 --> 00:33:29,071
            No way.             

727
00:33:29,106 --> 00:33:30,973
        There's no way.         

728
00:33:31,008 --> 00:33:33,976
     We just have               
     such low expectations      

729
00:33:34,011 --> 00:33:36,412
    for hot-- for hot people    
    to be anything.             

730
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,880
      I'm like, "You were       
      probably blown away       

731
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,349
   she wasn't just              
   sitting there playing        
   with her tits and drooling   

732
00:33:40,384 --> 00:33:41,951
       Like... (giggling)       

733
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,992
  I'm like, "What did she say   
  that was so funny?"           

734
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,828
     And he was like,           
     "Well, we were talking     

735
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,496
   "about playing pool later    
   and she was like,            

736
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,364
     'Get ready to lose.'"      

737
00:34:02,239 --> 00:34:05,508
    I was like, "Oh, when's     
    her hour special coming     
    out on HBO?                 

738
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,510
        What a great..."        

739
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,580
     (cheering, whistling)      

740
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:13,583
           Fuck you.            

741
00:34:17,589 --> 00:34:19,421
    Wouldn't that have gone     
    so different if it were     

742
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,357
     like just                  
     a normal-looking girl?     

743
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,758
      She's like,               
      "Get ready to lose."      

744
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,460
   They would have been like,   
   "Did you hear that cunt?     

745
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,729
    Like, what a fucking..."    

746
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,097
  But instead they were like,   

747
00:34:28,132 --> 00:34:30,366
    "Oh, my God,                
    you should be Seinfeld."    

748
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,934
             Um...              

749
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,538
    The whole reason I got      
    tickets to the game, um,    

750
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,139
     he gave me these seats     
     because he thought         

751
00:34:37,174 --> 00:34:39,709
  I was mad at him              
  for sexually harassing me...  

752
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,377
        which I wasn't.         

753
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,745
         Like, I'm 33.          

754
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,047
      I really appreciate       
      that shit right now.      

755
00:34:45,082 --> 00:34:46,148
           I just...            

756
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:48,784
      You know, when            
      you're in your 20s,       

757
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,653
    if you walk                 
    past a construction site    

758
00:34:50,688 --> 00:34:52,154
   and they're like, "Yeah,"    
   you're like,                 

759
00:34:52,189 --> 00:34:55,190
        "How dare you!          
        My secret bits!"        

760
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,927
             But...             
           (laughter)           

761
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:02,097
   In your 30s, you walk past   
   and you're like,             

762
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,734
    "What about this, huh?"     

763
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,669
       My skirt's, like,        
       over my head.            

764
00:35:06,704 --> 00:35:08,037
       I'm like... "Aah!"       

765
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,173
        They're like,           
        "We're eating."         

766
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,708
       I'm like... "Aah!"       

767
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,446
       That shit changes.       
       It does.                 

768
00:35:17,481 --> 00:35:19,415
   Who here is in their 40s?    

769
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,517
           (cheering)           

770
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:22,919
        What about 30s?         

771
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,187
       (loud cheering)          

772
00:35:25,222 --> 00:35:26,388
              20s?              

773
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,323
       (louder cheering)        

774
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:31,694
     Do you hear that hope?     
     Remember?                  

775
00:35:32,697 --> 00:35:34,830
   Do you remember 20s hope?    

776
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:36,699
      Do you? I kinda do.       

777
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,401
      You know,                 
      you just walk around      

778
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:43,405
   like, "Everything's gonna    
   work out.                    

779
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:47,509
    Everybody's always gonna    
    want to fuck me!"           

780
00:35:47,545 --> 00:35:48,744
     And then you're like,      
     "Oh, cool.                 

781
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,646
        Cellulite on my         
        hands and feet."        

782
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:52,014
             Um...              

783
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:57,386
     In your 20s, you're        
     so corrupt with power,     

784
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:59,421
      especially if you're      
      in love in your 20s.      

785
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:02,257
    Remember 20s love?          
    You're just so arrogant.    

786
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:05,561
      You're like,              
      "We're so lucky           
      we found each other.      

787
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,797
    What are all                
    these sad songs about?"     

788
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:09,665
           (scoffing)           

789
00:36:16,074 --> 00:36:19,241
    I think of 20s love         
    the same as the tsunami,    

790
00:36:19,276 --> 00:36:25,848
      because I read that       
      in the tsunami,           
      the tide was way in,      

791
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:28,250
     so, fish were flopping     
     around the shore           

792
00:36:28,285 --> 00:36:29,485
        and people were,        
        like, psyched.          

793
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,120
      They were gathering       
      them with baskets.        

794
00:36:31,155 --> 00:36:35,457
   Like,                        
   "I can't believe my luck.    
   Look at all these fish!"     

795
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,227
    That's, like, 20s love.     

796
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,630
        You're like,            
        "For me and me!"        

797
00:36:42,399 --> 00:36:46,669
     And then you're like,      
     "Oh, fuck!"                

798
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,038
      And it murders you.       

799
00:36:56,447 --> 00:36:57,947
           But yeah.            

800
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,181
         But enjoy it.          

801
00:36:59,216 --> 00:37:00,482
             Um...              

802
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,853
       (laughter, cheers)       

803
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,187
           Enjoy it.            

804
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:07,723
     (humming nonchalantly)     

805
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,327
   That's why I'm so annoyed    
   I'm single again.            

806
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:15,998
   That means I'm gonna have    
   to go out with a new dude    
   and he'll--                  

807
00:37:16,034 --> 00:37:17,599
     We'll go to the movies     
     and he'll be like,         

808
00:37:17,635 --> 00:37:18,634
       "Do you want             
       to get a popcorn?"       

809
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,302
       and I'll be              
       like, "Oh, my God,       

810
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:21,704
       "I hadn't even           
       thought about it.        

811
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,940
       "Um... that's not        
       the whole reason         

812
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,743
   I wanted to come see         
   this piece of shit movie."   

813
00:37:32,249 --> 00:37:34,650
    I've left so many movies    
    right after the previews    

814
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:36,118
 'cause I finished my popcorn.  

815
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:43,592
    And then he's like,         
    "What size do you want?"    

816
00:37:43,627 --> 00:37:47,229
   and I'm like... (giggles)    
   "Small, look at me."         

817
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,266
     Meanwhile,                 
     a small popcorn, like,     

818
00:37:51,302 --> 00:37:52,835
       that's like              
       taking one Advil.        

819
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,570
       Like, get the fuck       
       out of here.             

820
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:58,107
  It's like taking six Xanax.   

821
00:37:58,142 --> 00:38:00,209
      Like, why are             
      you wasting my time?      

822
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:03,645
         Small popcorn.         

823
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,081
      And then                  
      the cashier is like,      

824
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,817
     "For $15, you can          
     get one more handful,"     

825
00:38:07,852 --> 00:38:12,088
 and I'm like,                  
 "That sounds like              
 a great deal. We'll take it."  

826
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:15,191
   You sit in there             
   and you're supposed to act   

827
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,292
    like you're not thinking    
    about the popcorn           

828
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:18,961
   and you're just              
   watching the movie, like,    

829
00:38:18,996 --> 00:38:22,732
     "Oh, I forgot that         
     we even had popcorn."      

830
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,069
     But really,                
     I just want to, like,      

831
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:29,739
      push his eyes             
      in with my thumbs...      

832
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:33,609
  and just dump                 
  the popcorn all over my face  

833
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,177
       and head and just        
       run out screaming,       

834
00:38:35,213 --> 00:38:37,747
   "You would have found out    
   anyway, motherfucker!"       

835
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:42,051
       (applause, cheers)       

836
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:52,828
         So I'm single.         

837
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:55,097
             Um...              
           (laughter)           

838
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,632
       I know, you guys         
       are all thinking,        

839
00:38:56,667 --> 00:39:00,102
 like, "Amy, this is all great, 
 but how do we date you?"       

840
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:01,503
         Um, you can't.         

841
00:39:01,538 --> 00:39:03,773
     And not just               
     'cause I'm not totally     

842
00:39:03,808 --> 00:39:05,241
        out of the woods        
        with this UTI,          

843
00:39:05,276 --> 00:39:07,409
          but also...           
           (laughter)           

844
00:39:07,444 --> 00:39:10,746
 I am not on any dating sites.  

845
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:13,215
       Like, the only app       
       I have on my phone       

846
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:15,184
   like that is Foodspotting,   

847
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:17,887
     which is like Tinder       
     but for food.              

848
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:22,892
   So, it lets you know         
   about foods in your area.    

849
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:24,326
             Uh...              

850
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,128
    Like the other day          
    I was, like, eyeing up,     

851
00:39:26,164 --> 00:39:31,066
 like, this one scone           
 and it was under a mile away,  

852
00:39:31,102 --> 00:39:34,103
    I was like,                 
    "Is this a coincidence?     
    Like, I don't--"            

853
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:36,038
       It's like, "Yes."        

854
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:40,542
    And then, uh...             
    I'm like, "Should I go?"    

855
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:44,379
    and my friends are like,    
    "Go! Like, go! See!"        

856
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:45,948
     and I'm like, "Okay."      

857
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:48,250
      So I went                 
      and I kind of, like,      

858
00:39:48,286 --> 00:39:49,852
     sidled up to the scone     
     and it's like,             

859
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,788
    "Oh, my God, you look       
    just like your picture.     

860
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:55,457
      Do you want to come       
      home with me?"            

861
00:39:55,492 --> 00:39:56,491
        (chews loudly)          

862
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:58,127
             Um...              

863
00:39:58,162 --> 00:39:59,428
           (giggles)            

864
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,298
        And I was, like,        
        I was hungry,           

865
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,167
  so I was putting              
  a little butter on saltines...

866
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,305
     but then I kinda took      
     a look at myself.          

867
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,973
         I'm like,              
         "Hold on, Amy.         

868
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,075
       "Like, you're not        
       Martha Stewart,          

869
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,211
      "just put the butter      
      and the cracker           

870
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:19,215
   in your mouth and they'll    
   find each other in there."   

871
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,253
   Who am I? I'm like           
   the "Barefoot Contestant'    
   or whatever.                 

872
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,955
        I'm like, "Uh!"         

873
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,557
       Dirtying a knife.        

874
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,660
  So, I was dating someone      
  for a little bit this year.   

875
00:40:31,695 --> 00:40:33,829
  I was dating                  
  an infectious disease doctor  

876
00:40:33,865 --> 00:40:35,264
       'cause two birds.        

877
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:38,133
             And...             
           (laughter)           

878
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:39,835
       What do you want?        

879
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:44,473
   And he wound up being a,     
   like, an insane alcoholic    

880
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:46,608
      and that's my thing.      

881
00:40:46,643 --> 00:40:48,310
             Uh...              

882
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,545
 I feel like in most            
 relationships, there's, like,  

883
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:53,115
   one alcoholic,               
   and then, like, one person   

884
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:56,051
      who's sad about it,       
      and I wanted to be,       
      like, the fun one.        

885
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:04,059
    So, I called my mom, um,    

886
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:05,928
       because nothing          
       makes her happier        

887
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,496
      than me being alone,      

888
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:11,767
     and she's like,            
     "Oh, my God, will I be     
     seeing you more?"          

889
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:14,870
   Um...                        
   and I'm like, "Yes, Mom,"    

890
00:41:14,906 --> 00:41:16,405
       and she starts           
       giving me advice.        

891
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,342
 She's like,                    
 "Am, you need to love          
 like you've never been hurt,"  

892
00:41:22,046 --> 00:41:24,914
  and I'm like,                 
  "Are you reading off of       
  a bumper sticker right now?"  

893
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:28,284
   Like... she's like, "Dance   
   like no one's watching."     

894
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,752
   Like, dance like a couple    
   of people are watching.      

895
00:41:30,788 --> 00:41:34,589
  Right? Even if you're alone,  
  maybe hold it together.       

896
00:41:36,493 --> 00:41:39,528
      Cross the street          
      like no cars-- What?      

897
00:41:41,498 --> 00:41:43,032
     I was thinking             
     about this last night      

898
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:47,369
   and I was having             
   a little, um, wine and...    

899
00:41:47,405 --> 00:41:51,706
   weed and an Ambien, um...    

900
00:41:51,742 --> 00:41:53,943
       or as I call it,         
       tucking myself in.       

901
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,244
             Um...              

902
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:02,251
     (cheering, whistling)      

903
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,086
    Good night, moon. And...    

904
00:42:08,625 --> 00:42:10,125
              I...              

905
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,161
      I am a good person.       
      I swear to you.           

906
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,329
   Like, I'm very old-school.   

907
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,830
       I think the guy          
       should always pay        

908
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:19,801
       on the first date        
       for sex and...           

909
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:20,936
        I'm a romantic.         

910
00:42:20,972 --> 00:42:22,637
    I'm labeled a sex comic.    

911
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:24,039
  Like, that's in interviews.   

912
00:42:24,075 --> 00:42:27,876
 People are always like,        
 "So you-- you talk about sex," 

913
00:42:27,911 --> 00:42:29,945
  and I'm like... I think       
  it's just 'cause I'm a girl.  

914
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:31,613
   I feel like a guy could      
   get up here and literally    

915
00:42:31,648 --> 00:42:33,248
  pull his dick out             
  and everybody would be like,  

916
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:35,351
       "He's a thinker."        
       But...                   

917
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,854
       (laughter, cheers)       
             Right?             

918
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:44,093
           It's true.           

919
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,628
   But then I mention one UTI   
   and everyone just thinks     

920
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:49,164
  I walk around leaving,        
  like, a snail trail of cum,   

921
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,700
        I'm just like...        

922
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,336
     And they're like,          
     "Oh, Amy's been here."     

923
00:42:59,943 --> 00:43:02,444
  Cum is unsettling, isn't it?  

924
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,482
       I don't say that         
       to shock you or--        

925
00:43:06,517 --> 00:43:09,318
   or get your attention--      
   Like, "Oh, no she didn't."   

926
00:43:09,353 --> 00:43:12,488
 Like, I'm just reminding       
 you that we're all disgusting. 

927
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,390
    No one in here is better    
    than anyone else.           

928
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,526
    Like, you've all caught     
    a hot load, you know?       

929
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:22,097
     Like, if that provides     
     you with discomfort,       

930
00:43:22,133 --> 00:43:24,866
      you're just looking       
      at it the wrong way.      

931
00:43:24,902 --> 00:43:27,002
        We need to be           
        nicer about cum.        

932
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,070
         We really do.          

933
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,605
  Cum gives us life, you know?  

934
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:34,243
        Gandhi was cum.         

935
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:38,313
          Oprah-- cum.          

936
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,449
   Oprah could have wound up    
   all over somebody's tits,    

937
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:44,153
         but no...              
         we got Oprah.          

938
00:43:44,188 --> 00:43:46,988
       (cheers, whistles)       

939
00:43:47,024 --> 00:43:48,457
        Thank you, cum.         

940
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:55,531
   And yes, it is sticky        
   and gross and no one ever    

941
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:59,501
    wants it in their mouth     
    ever, ever, ever, but...    

942
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:03,305
  we need to change             
  how we're thinking about it.  

943
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:06,408
     It's not a wonderfully     
     regal moment               

944
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:09,478
     as a woman                 
     when you take a load.      

945
00:44:09,513 --> 00:44:12,781
    Um... when someone cums     
    in you, you're not like,    

946
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,350
     "We can do it.             
     I'm glad I leaned in."     

947
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:17,018
           It's not--           

948
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:22,091
    But it's a fact of life.    

949
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,960
   All the greatest women       
   have dealt with it, okay?    

950
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,761
      Ruth Bader Ginsburg.      

951
00:44:30,934 --> 00:44:32,667
         Diane Sawyer.          

952
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:36,472
  Michelle Obama, who I love,   
  like the rest of us,          

953
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,308
     probably once a week       
     has to carefully walk      
     to the bathroom.           

954
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,943
    Just squish, squish,        
    squish, squish, squish,     

955
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:44,879
    squish, squish, squish,     
    squish, squish, squish.     

956
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,316
 It's the White House.          
 It's probably a long hallway.  

957
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:51,320
    Squish, squish, squish,     
    squish, squish, squish.     

958
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:54,423
   And with her perfect arms,   
   she has to deal with it.     

959
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:55,690
            Just...             

960
00:44:55,726 --> 00:44:59,495
   "This is more than normal.   
   I wonder what's..."          

961
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:02,297
 Barack's like,                 
 "Get out here. I want          
 to talk about those e-mails."  

962
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,300
  She's like, "I'm cleaning     
  out your troops right now."   

963
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:14,176
       Yeah, I am labeled       
       a sex comic and...       

964
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:18,113
    I just think that sex       
    is explained incorrectly    

965
00:45:18,149 --> 00:45:20,315
     as far as men              
     and women's roles go.      

966
00:45:20,351 --> 00:45:22,618
   It's like, we're all told    
   over and over again,         

967
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:27,289
   men love sex and women       
   just deal with it, right?    

968
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:29,191
      Like, every article,      
      every sitcom,             

969
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,126
  it's always the guy           
  getting home from work like,  

970
00:45:31,162 --> 00:45:33,562
       "Honey, how about        
       tonight, huh?"           

971
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:39,934
 And she's always like,         
 "Blah! You know I hate         
 your dick. Laundry, laundry."  

972
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,073
          It's insane.          

973
00:45:45,108 --> 00:45:46,642
      I don't know              
      any girls like that.      

974
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,044
       Every girl I know        
       likes having sex.        

975
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,412
       I love having sex.       

976
00:45:50,447 --> 00:45:53,114
   Not a weird amount,          
   but like a normal person.    

977
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:55,250
   All of my friend-- I mean,   
   one of them doesn't,         

978
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:56,818
    but we think something,     
    like, happened to her.      

979
00:45:56,853 --> 00:46:00,855
   But... but you're made       
   to feel really disgusting    

980
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:03,124
   and weird if you're a girl   
   who likes to have sex.       

981
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:05,060
  Like, I've dated some guy--   

982
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,196
     I would say 50%            
     in the relationships,      

983
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:10,131
      I initiate the sex,       
      and then 50%              
      we don't have it.         

984
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:11,600
             Um...              

985
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:15,571
     No, but I've been          
     in relationships where     

986
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:17,239
     it's always the dude,      
     like (grunts)              

987
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,608
  and then you, like, later     
  realize he was a sex addict,  

988
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:22,043
     which-- Have you ever      
     dated a sex addict?        

989
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:24,979
      It's so fun at first      
      when you don't know.      

990
00:46:25,015 --> 00:46:30,051
 You're like, "Am I the hottest 
 piece of ass in the world?"    

991
00:46:30,087 --> 00:46:32,688
     And then you're like,      
     "Oh, no, he would          
     fuck a mailbox."           

992
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:34,423
             Um...              

993
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,358
     Which is why               
     I'm dressed like this.     

994
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:39,361
          Uh... but...          

995
00:46:39,396 --> 00:46:42,197
 And then, you know,            
 I've dated guys where I always 

996
00:46:42,233 --> 00:46:44,266
    have to initiate            
    and that's embarrassing.    

997
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,835
     It's because I used to     
     fuck really dumb guys      

998
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:49,504
      and I miss that           
      so very, very much.       

999
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,242
 Dumb guys really pound you...  

1000
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:55,510
      'cause they're dumb.      

1001
00:46:57,615 --> 00:47:00,215
      I love men, though.       
      I really do.              

1002
00:47:00,251 --> 00:47:01,550
      I was on the subway       
      the other day             

1003
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:03,619
   and I heard these two guys   
   having this conversation.    

1004
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,153
    So there's two of them.     
    They're standing            

1005
00:47:05,188 --> 00:47:06,788
      on the subway             
      and they're like...       

1006
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:08,823
        He's like,              
        "Dude, you gotta        
        go to this bar.         

1007
00:47:08,859 --> 00:47:12,193
     They give you chips as     
     soon as you sit down."     

1008
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:18,333
    And the other guy goes,     
    "Yeah, but they don't       
    refill 'em, right?"         

1009
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,705
        He's like,              
        "They refill 'em        
        the whole time.         

1010
00:47:25,576 --> 00:47:27,142
        He goes, "Sick!"        

1011
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,611
    And then they were quiet    
    for, like, ten stops.       

1012
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:30,979
       Just kinda like...       

1013
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,319
     just, like, basking        
     in the great exchange.     

1014
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:42,123
     I just-- I just            
     loved them, you know?      

1015
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,259
  I just looked at them like,   
  "I want that.                 

1016
00:47:44,295 --> 00:47:46,628
     Why can't that be me?"     

1017
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:48,463
   'Cause you know,             
   if it had been two girls,    

1018
00:47:48,499 --> 00:47:49,864
       I would have been        
       looking, thinking,       

1019
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:55,036
   "That's so cool that these   
   two special needs women...   

1020
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:57,906
  found each other, you know?"  

1021
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,679
      If it had been            
      me and a girlfriend       

1022
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,581
     and I was like,            
     "They give you chips.      

1023
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,651
           (laughter)           

1024
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,160
       (cheers, applause)       

1025
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:21,129
        They give you--"        
        you'd be like,          

1026
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,731
      "Oh, my God,              
      where's their stop?       

1027
00:48:22,766 --> 00:48:24,098
      Like, don't they          
      have an attendant?"       

1028
00:48:24,134 --> 00:48:25,266
       You'd be worried.        

1029
00:48:28,038 --> 00:48:30,305
   But I like creative types.   

1030
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,840
       I fucked up.             
       I got to an age,         

1031
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:35,811
  I want to be                  
  able to have a conversation   
  with someone, like an idiot,  

1032
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:39,147
    and the creative types,     
    they're all... ugh,         

1033
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:40,782
   like, comics and artists.    

1034
00:48:40,818 --> 00:48:42,484
       They all--               
       You have to treat        

1035
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:44,486
     their dick like            
     a souffl in the oven.     

1036
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,488
         You can't make         
         a big motion           

1037
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,490
     or loud noise near it      
     or it'll fall              

1038
00:48:48,525 --> 00:48:51,360
   and you have to start over   
   with a good attitude.        

1039
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:53,595
            (grunts)            

1040
00:48:57,234 --> 00:48:58,433
     Is that how                
     you jerk someone off?      

1041
00:48:58,469 --> 00:48:59,735
         Am I doing it?         

1042
00:49:01,572 --> 00:49:02,804
          It's crazy.           

1043
00:49:05,008 --> 00:49:07,075
    Like, we--                  
    It's crazy that we get--    

1044
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,777
   we get guilted about this.   

1045
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,445
     Like, women wanna cum.     

1046
00:49:10,481 --> 00:49:12,080
    Of course we wanna cum.     

1047
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,548
   What girls are having sex    

1048
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,917
   like, "Oh, no, I'm just--    
   I'm just honored to be       

1049
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:19,921
   "witnessing your process.    
   I-- It's just so cool        

1050
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,323
    "to be a part of--          
    No, I don't want to feel    

1051
00:49:22,359 --> 00:49:24,726
    "the one good thing         
    we're allowed as humans.    

1052
00:49:24,762 --> 00:49:28,697
   No, I-- This is just you.    
   Please, anywhere."           

1053
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,898
             Um...              

1054
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:34,202
   Make your girls cum, guys.   

1055
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:36,638
     It's just                  
     explained incorrectly.     

1056
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:37,672
          It's just...          

1057
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:39,508
     I remember                 
     as a very young girl,      

1058
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,376
      too young, it was         
      broken down for me.       

1059
00:49:41,412 --> 00:49:42,744
       It was like,             
       "Be careful, Amy.        

1060
00:49:42,780 --> 00:49:45,146
   "Men only want one thing.    

1061
00:49:45,181 --> 00:49:46,815
       They are all gonna       
       try and fuck you!"       

1062
00:49:50,754 --> 00:49:52,053
      I was like, "Okay."       

1063
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:56,057
       And then I waited.       

1064
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,599
   "Let's see.                  
   Am I on the wrong street?    

1065
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:06,601
          Are they..."          

1066
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,638
  I do like talking about sex.  

1067
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,072
         I like hearing         
         about it more.         

1068
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:13,842
      Like, I love hearing      
      sex acts, you know?       

1069
00:50:13,877 --> 00:50:17,011
  There's, like, terms for all  
  those-- all that stuff.       

1070
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:20,248
  Like, there's a...            
  the donkey punch, you know,   

1071
00:50:20,283 --> 00:50:21,783
       or, like,                
       the dirty Sanchez.       

1072
00:50:21,819 --> 00:50:23,318
      These are the ones--      
      the classics              

1073
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,719
        we all grew             
        up with, right?         

1074
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,489
   Those are, like,             
   the "To Kill a Mockingbird"  

1075
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,123
         of sex terms.          

1076
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:32,360
  But there are so many         
  that you've never heard of.   

1077
00:50:32,395 --> 00:50:33,628
    I love hearing new ones.    

1078
00:50:33,664 --> 00:50:36,898
 There's, like...               
 there's the dirty Rochester... 

1079
00:50:36,934 --> 00:50:38,366
   Did you ever hear of that?   

1080
00:50:38,401 --> 00:50:43,404
  Okay, that is where           
  the guy shits on your chest   

1081
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,974
    while he's on a business    
    trip to Rochester.          

1082
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,817
       Is that maybe            
       not really a thing       

1083
00:50:55,853 --> 00:50:59,187
   and I was perhaps lied to?   

1084
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,992
      I love-- There--          
      there's the dolphin.      

1085
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,427
  That's where the guy tries    
  to put it in the girl's butt  

1086
00:51:06,463 --> 00:51:08,096
      and she goes,             
      "Ehh-ehh, ehh-ehh."       

1087
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,303
       That's, like,            
       a fun family one.        

1088
00:51:19,710 --> 00:51:22,043
           There's...           

1089
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,946
     the Alaskan pipeline,      
     which, um...               

1090
00:51:26,884 --> 00:51:30,451
    a guy shits in a condom,    
    freezes it...               

1091
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:31,987
    and then you know what?     

1092
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,121
         I won't say            
         the end of it          

1093
00:51:33,156 --> 00:51:35,156
   'cause it doesn't end,       
   like, in a super romantic,   

1094
00:51:35,191 --> 00:51:37,926
  like, "Notebook"-y type way.  

1095
00:51:37,961 --> 00:51:39,227
      She doesn't like,         
      pull it out and find      

1096
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:41,696
     a ring on it               
     and say, like, "Yes!"      

1097
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,700
      There's no good one       
      for the girl.             

1098
00:51:45,736 --> 00:51:48,102
  There's no, like,             
  wacky Shirley where she sits  

1099
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:49,604
     on his face                
     and reads her tweets,      

1100
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:50,739
     like, there's nothing.     

1101
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:53,074
        We have nothing.        

1102
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:58,513
   Does anyone know one         
   that's good for the girl?    
   Anybody?                     

1103
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,649
           No, right?           

1104
00:52:00,684 --> 00:52:01,883
         I asked that--         
         I asked that           

1105
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,519
 in the first show              
 and somebody said the minivan. 

1106
00:52:04,555 --> 00:52:07,722
    Two in the front,           
    five in the back, and...    

1107
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,565
 I don't even know what         
 he was referring to, actually. 

1108
00:52:18,234 --> 00:52:20,569
    Do you guys know any?       
    I love hearing new ones.    

1109
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:22,637
    Does anybody have-- Huh?    

1110
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:25,339
     Man: The angry dragon.     
     The angry dragon?          
     What is that?              

1111
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:26,908
  Um, basically, when you're--  

1112
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:29,744
     When a girl                
     is sucking your dick--     

1113
00:52:29,780 --> 00:52:31,046
     When a girl                
     is sucking your dick--     

1114
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,948
   Oh, my-- Wait, I love        
   how your girlfriend looks    
   right now.                   

1115
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,316
    She's like, "Please..."     

1116
00:52:35,351 --> 00:52:38,186
        You're his mom?         
        Oh, my God!             

1117
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:55,503
        This is totally         
        your fault, Mom!        

1118
00:52:55,538 --> 00:52:58,506
 This beautiful boy you raised. 

1119
00:52:58,541 --> 00:53:00,141
   Well, let's hear the story   
   of how you were born.        

1120
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,175
           Go ahead.            

1121
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,245
         Angry dragon.          

1122
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:07,181
  All right. Uh, basically      
  when you're about to climax,  

1123
00:53:07,217 --> 00:53:09,985
 when you're getting a blowjob, 
 you push her head--            

1124
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,286
  When you're about to climax,  
  you push her head...          

1125
00:53:12,322 --> 00:53:14,322
      You push her head         
      at the back of her--      

1126
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,724
      I like that               
      he's acting it out.       

1127
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:20,228
      Like, he's like,          
      "This is what             
      it looks like! Yes!"      

1128
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,197
      ...and the jizz goes      
      up through the nose.      

1129
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,166
      Up through the nose.      

1130
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:26,534
       What's your name?        

1131
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,772
      What is it? George?       

1132
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:31,806
            Jordan.             

1133
00:53:31,842 --> 00:53:33,341
        Jordan, I think         
        you're grounded.        

1134
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:36,144
       (laughter, cheers)       

1135
00:53:40,517 --> 00:53:41,916
        I love you, Mom.        

1136
00:53:41,952 --> 00:53:43,852
  Thank you for bringing him.   

1137
00:53:43,887 --> 00:53:48,156
  For raising him               
  into the perfect gentleman.   

1138
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,891
     There's none that          
     are good for the girl.     

1139
00:53:49,926 --> 00:53:52,627
 There's one called the raccoon 
 where you just punch her       

1140
00:53:52,663 --> 00:53:54,963
   in both eyes                 
   and knock over her trash.    

1141
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:57,365
      Like, they're not...      

1142
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,567
 That doesn't even make sense.  

1143
00:54:04,975 --> 00:54:06,775
  There's the Abraham Lincoln.  

1144
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:10,145
    That's where he--           
    the guy trims his pubes,    

1145
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:14,282
  cums on the girl's face,      
  and then... (blows)           
  throws the pubes...           

1146
00:54:15,786 --> 00:54:18,153
  so she has that facial hair.  

1147
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,194
        You guys don't          
        like US history?        

1148
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,563
    I can't gauge the crowd.    

1149
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:30,131
         What's wrong?          

1150
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,601
        The worst one           
        I've ever heard         

1151
00:54:33,636 --> 00:54:37,138
        is the Houdini,         
        which is where          

1152
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:39,674
   the guy's having sex         
   with the girl from behind,   

1153
00:54:39,710 --> 00:54:43,578
  then unbeknownst to her,      
  his friend subs in for him.   

1154
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,081
  Guy number one runs outside,  

1155
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:49,084
     knocks on the window,      
     waves to the girl...       

1156
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,091
      which is just rape.       

1157
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,427
    Like, that's just rape.     

1158
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:01,295
   It's not fair to Houdini.    

1159
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:04,398
    Like, no girl is gonna      
    think that's hilarious.     

1160
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:06,000
       No girl's gonna be       
       like, "What?             

1161
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,469
             "Ahh!              

1162
00:55:08,504 --> 00:55:13,374
       (cheers, applause)       

1163
00:55:13,409 --> 00:55:16,611
   "Baby, I thought you were    
   fucking me, but it's Phil!   

1164
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,079
          I love you!"          

1165
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:21,549
   Thank you so much, Apollo!   

1166
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:22,650
             Muah!              

1167
00:55:22,685 --> 00:55:26,354
     (whistling, cheering)      

1168
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,964
      (rap music playing)       

1169
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,698
              Yo              

1170
00:55:37,734 --> 00:55:39,533
             Man              

1171
00:55:41,138 --> 00:55:43,404
           Man, uh            

1172
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:46,074
      Bitches ain't shit      

1173
00:55:46,109 --> 00:55:47,976
         And they ain't        
        sayin' nothin'         

1174
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:51,079
    A hundred motherfuckers

00:55:51,114 --> 00:55:52,480
      I beez in the trap      

1176
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,182
     Be-Beez in the trap      

1177
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:55,683
      I beez in the trap      

1178
00:55:55,718 --> 00:55:57,351
     Be-Beez in the trap      

1179
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,920
      Bitches ain't shit      

1180
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:00,789
         And they ain't        
        sayin' nothin'         

1181
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,925
    A hundred motherfuckers    
   can't tell me nothin'       

1182
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,293
      I beez in the trap      

1183
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:06,995
     Be-Beez in the trap      

1184
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,496
      I beez in the trap      

1185
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,265
     Be-Beez in the trap      

1186
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:24,378
    Young Amy:                  
     Let me entertain you     

1187
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:27,048
    Let me do a few tricks    

1188
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,818
       Some old and then       
      some new tricks          

1189
00:56:29,853 --> 00:56:32,854
      I'm very versatile      

1190
00:56:32,889 --> 00:56:33,822
            Man:                
            Mm-hmm.             

1191
00:56:33,857 --> 00:56:35,924
   And if you're real good    

1192
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,159
