00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:06,810
<i>We all know the story of 
a maid named Snow White</i>

2
00:00:06,834 --> 00:00:10,686
<i>and of how the good dwarves 
tried to hide her from sight.</i>

3
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,540
<i>And who can forget how that 
Wicked Queen, the creep,

4
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:19,970
<i>gave Snow White the apple 
to cause eternal sleep?</i>

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,110
<i>Poison is strong, but
love stronger still.</i>

6
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,230
<i>One day came a Prince 
riding over the hill. </i>

7
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:35,736
<i>With love in his heart,
he reached out his hand.</i>

8
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,620
<i>His touch woke Snow White 
and brought joy to the land.</i>

9
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,660
<i>What follows now? 
A wedding.</i>

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,350
<i>Well, then let all the dwarves
be our seven best men.</i>

11
00:00:48,374 --> 00:00:49,374
<i>Good.</i>

12
00:00:50,274 --> 00:00:51,216
<i>Look.</i>

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,820
<i>They rode into the sunset 
and threw green clover. </i>

14
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:58,826
<i>But that isn't the end.
No, our story's not over.</i>

15
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,890
<i>So for those of you 
who feel perplexed</i>

16
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,300

That old hag won't be pushing us
around no more, Batso!

36
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,690
Gee, that's not a very
nice thing to call her.

37
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,090
You some kind of birdbrain 
or something?

38
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:52,040
These are the happiest 
days of our lives!

39
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,530
Well, I can't help it, Scowl.
I still feel sorry for the poor

40
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,930
Wicked Queen. -Sorry?!
You're a bat.

41
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,254
You're supposed to be 
bad. -Bad?

42
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:05,190
Yeah.

43
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,642
Mean. Ruthless. Cruel.

44
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:10,966
Rotten to the core.

45
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,800
Like me.

46
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,490
Nobody's perfect.

47
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:29,310
What's going on here?!

48
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,020
Did you invite him?

49
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:56,510
Where is my sister?

50
00:05:56,834 --> 00:06:02,234
Good evening, Your L-Lord.
Scowl, all at arms.

51
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,970
Nice night, ain't it?
-Where is she?

52
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:11,350
She... She went out 
for... a walk.

53
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:12,976
Right, Batso? 
-Scowl.

54
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,030
You know we're not 
supposed to tell fibs.

55
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,760
She did go out for a walk.

56
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,550
Yeah, but you didn't say when.

57
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,380
Ah, my sister's magic 
looking glass.

58
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,440
It will tell me what I 
want to know.

59
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,040
Looking glass upon the wall,

60
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,860
at my command,
you will show me all.

61
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,000
Keep it down, you noisy creep.
You're ruining my beauty sleep.

62
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,880
How dare you?!

63
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,920
Do your worst.
As you can see,

64
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,840
your magic cast 
no spell on me.

65
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,880
Is that so?

66
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,632
If you don't show me 
what happened to my sister,

67
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,080
I'll break you into 
a thousand pieces!

68
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,840
Oh, that might be a different
story. I'll show you all,

69
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,540
but you'll be sorry.

70
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:28,064
Sorry...

71
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,960
Whatever.

72
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,260
When water flows 
as though it's bled,

73
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:39,320
and sky does change from
blue to red, it's a sign to all.

74
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,350
The Queen is dead.

75
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,842
Ah! I scared myself.

76
00:07:44,866 --> 00:07:48,066
No, it can't be.

77
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,280
How did this happen?!

78
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,440
Here's the news. Your jealous 
sister met her plight

79
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,240
trying to harm 
the fair Snow White.

80
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:05,364
Snow White?! And who's 
the pretty boy she's with?

81
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,510
Ah, that'd be the Prince, 
Your Lordship.

82
00:08:08,534 --> 00:08:13,844
Snow White and her Prince.
Aren't they the happy couple?

83
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:22,350
From this day forward, I shall rule
this castle and all that is in it.

84
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:29,140
I will control the laws of nature 
and bend them to my will.

85
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:48,020
You and every wretched creature
like you will do my bidding.

86
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:59,350
I will twist and change and distort
everything in the Realm of Doom!

87
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,630
I shall have one purpose and
one purpose only.

88
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,480
Vengeance!

89
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,270
Snow White and her handsome
prince shall pay for what has

90
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,680

Where are we going?

106
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,720
To help Lord Maliss 
get Snow White.

107
00:11:10,844 --> 00:11:13,044
We gotta get back 
on his good side.

108
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,730
Which side is that?

109
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:18,354
Batso,

110
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:23,078
we're gonna show him 
we can be really bad.

111
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,300
I can't wait to see 
them again.

112
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,596
Me neither. If it weren't 
for the Seven Dwarfs,

113
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,640
I never would have found you.

114
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,500
Do you think it's silly to ride 
all this way just to

115
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:50,761
invite them to the wedding? 
-Not if it makes you happy.

116
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,185
Look at those flowers.

117
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,660
Oh, I'd love to pick some 
for the dwarfs. -Go ahead.

118
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:00,950
Is it safe to stop here?
-Don't worry, Snow White.

119
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,870
There's nothing to be afraid of.

120
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,510
With the Wicked Queen gone,
who would harm us?

121
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,650
Ready, Batso?

122
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:27,574
Well, I... I think so.
-I want you to be a vicious,

123
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,580
heartless fighting machine.
The very baddest there is.

124
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,410
Would you settle for just 
one of the top ten?

125
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,450
Snow White!

126
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
Come on!
Come on!

127
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,680
Come on, boy!

128
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,750
Watch me stop 
the Prince.

129
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,630
Hey, I'm back...

130
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,280
That's what I call bad.

131
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,910
Get away from me!

132
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,540
Watch this. I'll get her 
from behind.

133
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,780
Not bad.

134
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,440
Run, Snow White! Run!

135
00:14:52,464 --> 00:14:54,464
Don't turn back!

136
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,130
I've never seen such 
magic as this.

137
00:15:23,454 --> 00:15:25,954
Who are you? 
What do you want?

138
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,730
I'll find your Snow White.
You can be sure of that.

139
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,560
And I have a very special 
fate in store for you.

140
00:15:41,784 --> 00:15:44,884
Very special indeed.

141
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,350
Where am I?

142
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,650
Could it be?

143
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:33,620
It's the cottage of 
the Seven Dwarfs.

144
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,700
I'm so tired.

145
00:17:46,124 --> 00:17:48,064
I can't go on.

146
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:33,340
Hello? 
Hello?

147
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:35,264
Where are you?

148
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,780
I'm so thirsty.
I hope you won't mind.

149
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,300
My...

150
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,380
Your cottage sure is grown.

151
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
It's beautiful.

152
00:19:03,464 --> 00:19:04,764
Oh, my.

153
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:08,440
Oh, my goodness.

154
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:17,770
Well, you're not the Seven Dwarfs.
-I should say not.

155
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,220
But the Seven Dwarfs live in
that cottage. -Not anymore.

156
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,550
They opened up a new mine
way over in the next kingdom.

157
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:30,130
Oh, but, then, 
who are you?

158
00:19:30,154 --> 00:19:33,396
We're their cousins,
the Seven Dwarfelles.

159
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:35,720
They gave us their cottage.

160
00:19:39,644 --> 00:19:43,644
That's no use.
I just can't get it right.

161
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,620

Oh, look what you've done.
Oh, that really burns me up.

187
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,320
Thunderella, your name 
should be Blonderella.

188
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,120
Excuse me. I don't believe 
I've got your names.

189
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:18,930
I'm Muddy. I'm in charge 
of the earth itself.

190
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:22,750
While Sunburn is merely in
charge of the sunlight.

191
00:23:23,174 --> 00:23:24,474
Merely?

192
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:39,400
Oh, no. Here we go again.

193
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,300
That's Blossom. She's in charge 
of all the plants and flowers.

194
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:50,970
A pleasure, darling.

195
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,370
Nice to meet you.

196
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,660
And that's Marina.

197
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:17,584
Hello there. I'm in charge 
of all the lakes and rivers.

198
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,300
Hello, I'm Critterina.

199
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:31,224
I take care of all the 
animals in the forest.

200
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,240
Moonbeam's in charge 
of the night.

201
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,680
She's not herself during the day.

202
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,590
And who's the one who 
sang the lovely song?

203
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,196
That's Thunderella.
Mother Nature's

204
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:45,420
called her up for review.

205
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:48,544
That's never happened before.

206
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,300
I haven't even introduced myself.

207
00:24:53,724 --> 00:24:55,396
I'm Snow White.

208
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:58,996
Snow White? Our cousins 
told us all about you.

209
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,390
You and the Prince were 
to be married.

210
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:04,710
We were coming to invite the
Seven Dwarfs to the wedding,

211
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,840
but something 
terrible happened.

212
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,220
I was attacked and carried off
by a horrid bird.

213
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,550
Didn't the Prince come to your
rescue? -Oh, he tried.

214
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,330
Isn't that what a prince is for?

215
00:25:17,154 --> 00:25:18,654
We were separated.

216
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:22,080
And now I'm afraid something 
horrible has happened to him.

217
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,240
I've just got to find him.

218
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:30,830
There must be something 
we can do.

219
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:38,340
I've got it. Come with us 
to see Mother Nature.

220
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,320
She'll help find the prince.

221
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:43,640
Mother Nature?
I hope she can.

222
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:50,930
Looking glass upon the wall,

223
00:25:51,030 --> 00:25:53,580
at my command, 
you will show me all.

224
00:25:53,604 --> 00:25:58,104
Hold up. -I know that cottage.

225
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,240
Those infernal Seven Dwarfs 
live there.

226
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:06,380
No longer do the Dwarves 
there dwell.

227
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,760
Seems in their stead live 
Seven Dwarfelles.

228
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
Dwarfelles, eh?

229
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,560
Useless little fools.

230
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,220
Snow White?! Show me 
where they're headed.

231
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,340
Rainbow Falls.

232
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:32,080
This time Snow White 
won't be so lucky.

233
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:35,860
And that birdbrain Scowl
better not get in my way again.

234
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:39,484
Scowl? Scowl! 
Where are you?!

235
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,780
If I ever see that owl again,
there'll be nothing left but a

236
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,490
pile of feathers.

237
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,480
Why didn't we tell Lord
Maliss where we were?

238
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,870
Didn't you hear 
what he said?

239
00:26:56,994 --> 00:26:59,394
He's gonna tear us apart.

240
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,200
Well, he didn't say anything about
tearing me apart.

241
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,360
Come on, Batso!
-Now, what are we gonna do?

242
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,470
Just what you'd expect from 
two guys as bad as us.

243
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:19,770
Yeah? What's that? 
-We're gonna hide.

244
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,090
Why, what's the matter, 
Thunderella?

245
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:58,244
Oh, I can't do anything right.

246
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,800
The others are all so special.

247
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:07,690
Muddy's smart, and Sunburns's brave 
and strong and oh, Blossom's so pretty.

248
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,040
You're special too. You are.
Everyone is in their own way.

249
00:28:13,264 --> 00:28:14,756
Not me.

250
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,910
Except for making mistakes 
all the time.

251
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,660
Just keep doing your best 
and being yourself.

252
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,084
Come on.
We're almost there.

253
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,450
Where are we?

254
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,640
Mother Nature's garden.

255
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,240
I'm sure it won't be as bad 
as you think.

256
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:08,870
Yeah, she's right.
It'll probably be much worse.

257
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020

She won't be kindly disposed to

281
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:05,670
But I know what she was 
trying to make.

282
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,860
Of course, I wouldn't expect the
likes of you to figure it out.

283
00:31:10,870 --> 00:31:12,260
I know.

284
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,784
She was trying 
to make a catfish.

285
00:31:16,884 --> 00:31:19,084
Must be beginner's luck.

00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,520
Dear me. You won't do at all.

287
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:25,944
Oh, let's see. 
A dash of this.

288
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,030
A pinch of that.

289
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:32,554
Maybe this will work.

290
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:37,310
Oh, I hope I haven't goofed again.
-Bet you can't guess that one.

291
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,290
Is it a horsefly?

292
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,880
Have you played this before?

293
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:50,310
Oh, what about this? 
Smart alec.

294
00:31:51,134 --> 00:31:53,604
A bullfrog.

295
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,828
Well done, Muddy!

296
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:04,040
I know. I know. 
It's a cape rat.

297
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,640

Oh, you're here. Good.
All seven of you.

301
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:27,160
And who might you be,
young lady?

302
00:32:27,584 --> 00:32:29,156
I'm Snow White.

303
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:31,570
The Dwarfelles said 
you might help me.

304
00:32:31,594 --> 00:32:34,776
Oh, they did, did they?
Well, I'll get to you in a minute.

305
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,240
First I have some 
business with them.

306
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:40,760
Will the negligent 
party step forward?

307
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,500
Does that me?

308
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,780
Undo precipitation when air 
conditions were appropriate.

309
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,470
Injudicious use of 
anemometry.

310
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:57,570
Inadequate comprehension 
of climatology.

311
00:32:57,694 --> 00:33:00,094
Does that cover it?

312
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,120
And not only that.
I can't control the weather.

313
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,290
That's precisely 
what I said.

314
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,430
I never should have let the
lot of you have such powers.

315
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,670
See, I told you she'd take 
away Thunderella's powers.

316
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:22,020
The lot of us? 
-But, Mother Nature...

317
00:33:22,044 --> 00:33:25,144
Oh, don't think I haven't 
noticed all your squabbling,

318
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:28,510
using earthquakes and 
sunbeams at your every whim.

319
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:31,230
That's not what I gave you 
your powers for.

320
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,950
You were supposed 
to work together,

321
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:37,170
to help me when I can't be 
there, to create harmony.

322
00:33:38,694 --> 00:33:39,494
So you see,

323
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:44,070
that's why we cannot tolerate
mistakes in this line of work.

324
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,450
What about all the 
mistakes you make?

325
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:49,174
I beg your pardon?

326
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:52,560
Begging your pardon.
But even you make mistakes.

327
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,380
Oh, little ones, 
here and there.

328
00:33:55,604 --> 00:33:58,786
Don't you see? If everyone 
would just give Thunderella

329
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,160
a chance, I'm sure she 
could do her job.

330
00:34:01,194 --> 00:34:03,894
I'm sorry, young lady.
My decision is final.

331
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,160
The Dwarfelles shall be 
stripped of their powers.

332
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,960
Mother Nature, 
do something!

333
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,936
She can't even make a proper
dormouse. How's she gonna...

334
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,680
Stand back, woman.
This is none of your affair.

335
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,900
Don't worry. He can't 
harm us here.

336
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,324
Now be gone before I get mad.

337
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:51,770
Don't you want to know what
happened to your precious Prince?

338
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,470
Oh, please. Yes.

339
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,994
Thought so.

340
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:01,270
The answer lies in my 
castle, in the Realm of Doom.

341
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:04,910
And not even Mother Nature
can stop me there.

342
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:18,810
He looked so terrible. 
-Unbelievable, my dear.

343
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:21,700
He was wearing 
last year's cape.

344
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,240
Oh, dear. The uncivilized brute.

345
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:30,020
Don't you worry. You'll be safe 
if you stay with us.

346
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:35,030
Mother Nature will protect you.
-No, I must go to the Realm of Doom.

347
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,630
No, you mustn't!

348
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,154
No. You'd never 
come back.

349
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,640
You're certain you 
want to do this?

350
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,760
I must find my Prince.
-Well, it won't be easy.

351
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:49,310
Could the Seven Dwarfelles 
come with me?

352
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:52,640
Yes! -You want them?

353
00:35:54,764 --> 00:35:56,664
Very well.

354
00:35:56,688 --> 00:35:58,176
You miscreants have 
one last chance

355
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,976
to prove yourselves competent 
beneficiaries of the powers

356
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,950
with which I've 
endowed you.

357
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:05,290
Lord Maliss is very powerful.

358
00:36:05,290 --> 00:36:08,070
In his own domain, even I 
cannot stop him.

359
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:12,220
Above all else, Snow White,
you must keep your wits about you.

360
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:14,220
Thank you, Mother Nature.

361
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,840
Oh, there you are, you 
naughty little creation.

362
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,180
Now go.

363
00:36:29,204 --> 00:36:32,504
Follow the path past 
the seven pines

364
00:36:32,770 --> 00:36:34,890
and over the seven peaks.

365
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:40,844
The path leads through a cave
and into the Realm of Doom.

366
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,770
But remember, the closer you 
get to your destination,

367
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:50,500
the more dangerous your 
journey will become.

368
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,100
I tell you, darlings, it looks
awfully dark in there.

369
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:08,170
We need light. Sunburn,
can you help us?

370
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,040
They don't call me 
Sunburn for nothing.

371
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,020
Look.

372
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,584
It's beautiful.
-Gives me the creeps.

373
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:16,260
Look, there's someone 
in the shadows.

374
00:38:19,084 --> 00:38:22,784
Hey. Hey, who was he? 
There he goes.

375
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,060
Get that Shadow Man!

376
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,990
Quick, over here!

377
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,120
He's hurt.

378
00:39:02,844 --> 00:39:04,144
No, don't!

379
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,370
I bet he works for 
Lord Maliss.

380
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:07,950
No! No, no.

381
00:39:09,974 --> 00:39:11,974
What are you trying to tell us?

382
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,550
Oh, it's about time something
good happened on this trip.

383
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,650
That poor little man.

384
00:39:54,974 --> 00:39:56,974
If only I could have 
helped him.

385
00:39:57,070 --> 00:40:00,090
Oh, he gave me 
the willies.

386
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:04,014
I hope he got free.
-Quick, quick look.

387
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,850
We made it to the 
Realm of Doom.

388
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,740
I bet this very minute the
prince is watching us from one

389
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,630
of those castle windows.

390
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,990
Perfect! Soon I shall 
have my revenge.

391
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:31,000
It seems she falls in 
the trap of malice,

392
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:34,490
but in this fog, she ain't 
going to find the palace.

393
00:40:36,714 --> 00:40:39,114
You are insolent!

394
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:43,840
But you do have a point.
We wouldn't want her

395
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:46,104
to lose her way.

396
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:50,670
Perhaps I will provide 
an escort.

397
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:10,890
Why do we have to 
stay here? -I told you.

398
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:14,430
Lord Maliss will never 
find us down here.

399
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,600
What did the doggies 
want, Scowl?

400
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,730
Dinner. -I thought you 
were bad. -I am.

401
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,580
Well, why did the doggies 
want bad food?

402
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,150
I thought you said 
he'd never find...

403
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:53,774
I have a little task 
for you, my pets.

404
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:57,060
You will bring 
Snow White to me.

405
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:04,284
Do what you like with 
those idiot Dwarfelles.

406
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:07,650
But do not harm 
Snow White.

407
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,410
I want that pleasure 
myself. Now go.

408
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:16,434
Quickly!

409
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,300
Scowl!

410
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,700
Evening, Your Worship.

411
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:30,924
Fancy running 
into you down here.

412
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,400
The pleasure is all mine.

413
00:42:35,624 --> 00:42:39,324
Now there will be 
something to amuse me

414
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,800
while I await 
Snow White.

415
00:42:47,524 --> 00:42:49,124
Boy.

416
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,780
I bet Scowl will 
really have fun.

417
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,050
Nice little... Little...

418
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,556
Thing.

419
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,180
Now, now, Mother Nature 
wouldn't like that.

420
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:34,540
I don't think these are Mother 
Nature's creatures, Critterina.

421
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:37,640
That's right. This place 
ain't natural.

422
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,160
I think I have to give
this place a facelift.

423
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:09,570
Oh my goodness.

424
00:44:09,594 --> 00:44:12,646
I don't think your powers are
going to be much help here.

425
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:16,790
Thunderella?

426
00:44:17,514 --> 00:44:21,714
Thunderella, what is it?
-I heard something out there.

427
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:26,060
I don't hear anything. 
-Shh. Listen.

428
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,270
Thunderella!

429
00:44:35,494 --> 00:44:37,894
Stay back!
I'm warning you!

430
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,800
Good morning.

431
00:44:47,824 --> 00:44:50,524
A one, and the two,
and the three.

432
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:54,770
Moonbeam. Moonbeam. 
-Morning, Critterina.

433
00:45:02,610 --> 00:45:05,060
Critterina, tell them 
to get out of here.

434
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:19,660
What did they say?
-I didn't get all of it.

435
00:45:19,690 --> 00:45:22,630
Something about 
Dwarfelles and...

436
00:45:23,254 --> 00:45:24,854
Dessert.

437
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:34,280
This way.

438
00:46:31,250 --> 00:46:33,970
Oh, no. The Shadow Man.

439
00:46:52,350 --> 00:46:54,140
He wants us to come.

440
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:57,964
Don't trust him. -It's our 
only hope. Come on!

441
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,170
Come on, girls. Push!

442
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,980
She leads a charmed life.
Well, no more.

443
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:54,190
I'll handle this personally.

444
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:15,080
Your Lordship, y-y-y-y-y...
You're not leaving, are you?

445
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,450
Not that there hasn't been a
barrel of laughs at all, but...

446
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:29,400
W-w-w, wait. What about me? 
Aren't you gonna...

447
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,570
Hey!

448
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:36,440
Lord Maliss! 
Come back!

449
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:55,030
Please. Please, wait.
Please.

450
00:48:55,054 --> 00:48:57,054
Don't run away.

451
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:09,330
I only want to thank you.

452
00:49:11,054 --> 00:49:13,084
You saved us from the wolves.

453
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:18,340
And back in the cave, you were
trying to warn us about something.

454
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,080
It's almost as though you've...
You've been watching over me,

455
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,250
caring for me. Like... 
Like a friend.

456
00:49:26,274 --> 00:49:28,774
Snow White? Where 
are you? -Snow White?

457
00:49:30,074 --> 00:49:33,596
I better get back to the others.
Won't you come with me?

458
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:38,210
That is, if you want to. 
Please, come.

459
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:39,920
Come on. What are you doing?

460
00:49:58,090 --> 00:50:01,700
No, no, no.

461
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:30,650
He's gonna do something...
Horrible. I know it.

462
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:34,350
Not if we have anything 
to say about it. Come on.

463
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:45,530
That ding-dong bat.

464
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:58,210
I try to help him. I try 
to teach him what I know.

465
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,330
This is where it gets me.

466
00:51:01,854 --> 00:51:03,254
It ain't fair.

467
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,290
Wow, you look real bad.

468
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,320
Batso.

469
00:51:13,344 --> 00:51:16,196
Hey, Scowl. You really 
got to quit smoking.

470
00:51:16,220 --> 00:51:17,910
It's gonna kill you.

471
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,520
I'm about to be owl stew,
and he's worried about smoking.

472
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:23,870
Batso, quick.

473
00:51:23,894 --> 00:51:26,994
Shake a wing.
-Okay.

474
00:51:30,518 --> 00:51:34,218
No, blow out the candle!

475
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,870
Oh, sure thing, Scowl.

476
00:51:41,494 --> 00:51:45,294
What are you waiting for?
-I can't decide what to wish for.

477
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:46,818
Batso!

478
00:52:08,570 --> 00:52:11,590
We gotta get out of here.
Come on, Batso.

479
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,470
Now where are 
we going?

480
00:52:27,494 --> 00:52:30,456
As far away from Lord 
Maliss as we can get.

481
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,640
Too bad we can't stay 
for the party.

482
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,870
Party?

483
00:52:38,840 --> 00:52:41,160
Those are the Seven Dwarfelles.

484
00:52:41,190 --> 00:52:44,430
Now what? 
How do we get in?

485
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:47,154
Hey, somebody let us in!

486
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,160
We're here on official 
business of Mother Nature.

487
00:52:50,184 --> 00:52:52,706
Come on, Batso.
This is our big chance.

488
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,860
Lord Maliss will have to forgive
us if we capture one of them.

489
00:52:55,860 --> 00:52:59,140
You always have 
such bad ideas.

490
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:04,664
Open or you'll be sorry!

491
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,660
Get the loud mouth.
-I'm warning you,

492
00:53:07,690 --> 00:53:11,030
when I lose my temper,
I really get carried away.

493
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,970
At last. We've got it.
Batso,

494
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:30,360
how does it feel to be 
really bad?

495
00:53:30,384 --> 00:53:34,984
It feels bad. -Oh, 
this burns me up.

496
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,950
Let go of me, 
you little creep.

497
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:39,274
You mean him?

498
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:14,130
Come on, girls. 
Time for action.

499
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:36,510
Get them!

500
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,580
Snow White. 
Snow White, wake up.

501
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:58,780
My Prince?

502
00:55:59,204 --> 00:56:02,604
Is... Is it really you?
-Who else would it be?

503
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:08,028
Quickly. We must hide.

504
00:56:08,680 --> 00:56:11,410
But where are...
-No time for questions.

505
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:15,340
But...

506
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,400
Hurry.

507
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,260
I wonder where he's 
taking her.

508
00:56:39,284 --> 00:56:41,584
Needn't worry any more.

509
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:45,440
Beneath the Queen,
a secret door.

510
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,642
Wonderful. A looking 
glass that talks.

511
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:53,620
Beneath the Queen, 
huh? No way.

512
00:56:58,220 --> 00:57:00,320
See? It's a trick.

513
00:57:00,744 --> 00:57:02,444
It's not here.

514
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,040
Not here either.

515
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,440
Look, it's goinng down.
-The secret tower.

516
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,950
Well, how do you like that?

517
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:23,680
Thank you, my darling.
Darling! -Darling, darling.

518
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,450
I like it. Now you're cooking.
I'm through with malice.

519
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,400
You're better looking.

520
00:57:31,224 --> 00:57:33,324
Come on, girls.

521
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:40,480
Talking looking glasses,
tricky queens, secret doors.

522
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,090
This place burns me up.

523
00:57:44,114 --> 00:57:45,414
Hey!

524
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:55,340
Where are you taking me?
Please, can we go home?

525
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:59,440
Oh, we are going home,
Snow White.

526
00:58:08,410 --> 00:58:11,580
I... I don't understand. 
-You will.

527
00:58:12,304 --> 00:58:14,484
I've never seen you like this.

528
00:58:15,860 --> 00:58:19,020
Please, tell me where 
you're taking me?

529
00:58:19,144 --> 00:58:20,826
What's wrong, my dear?

530
00:58:20,850 --> 00:58:24,000
Don't you trust your 
beloved Prince?

531
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,570
Here we are.

532
00:58:46,294 --> 00:58:49,824
You will look out 
on this forever.

533
00:58:50,010 --> 00:58:52,250
What are you 
talking about?

534
00:58:54,074 --> 00:58:55,574
Look.

535
00:59:01,430 --> 00:59:03,500
You're not my Prince.

536
00:59:05,640 --> 00:59:09,240
You'll never see 
your Prince again!

537
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:19,760
No! Stay away!

538
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,020
You're cold, Snow White.

539
00:59:23,344 --> 00:59:26,244
Let me give you my cloak.

540
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:43,050
No!

541
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:46,440
You!

542
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:00,860
It's stone.

543
01:00:01,384 --> 01:00:03,684
The cape turned it 
to stone!

544
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,400
Come on.

545
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,790
You miserable wretch!

546
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,300
No, no.

547
01:00:57,424 --> 01:01:00,424
You killed him.
You monster!

548
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:21,160
Choose your pose,
Snow White.

549
01:01:21,184 --> 01:01:24,184
You'll stand here forever,

550
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,500
cast in stone.

551
01:01:27,924 --> 01:01:30,024
Don't you dare!

552
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:42,010
Oh, Snow White. 
-Thunderella.

553
01:01:42,034 --> 01:01:44,034
Can you untie me?

554
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:56,480
Nasty little creatures!

555
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,860
Especially this one.

556
01:02:13,110 --> 01:02:15,530
No. 
No!

557
01:02:16,440 --> 01:02:22,340
Seven new statues I hadn't 
even counted on.

558
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:26,920
And now you,
Snow White,

559
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:30,520
a moment I shall 
long cherish.

560
01:02:30,744 --> 01:02:35,944
Finally, your good luck 
runs out!

561
01:02:36,520 --> 01:02:40,840
Now, as my sister 
perished... -No.

562
01:02:40,864 --> 01:02:43,264
So shall you!

563
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,870
Come on. Come on, work.

564
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:56,920
Look! Snow White,
they're okay now!

565
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:10,480
I cared for him as dearly 
as the Prince.

566
01:04:10,904 --> 01:04:13,244
And now I've lost them both.

567
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:20,280
<i>Just as love brings 
the greatest joy,</i>

568
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:23,680
<i>it can also bring 
the greatest sorrow.</i>

569
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:27,940
<i>But then it is love 
which makes people</i>

570
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:31,764
<i>the most special of all
my creatures.</i>

571
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,550
It's all right, Snow White.

572
01:05:28,374 --> 01:05:30,084
Don't cry.

573
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:32,440
It's you.

574
01:05:33,364 --> 01:05:35,946
It's you! It was you all along.

575
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:38,590
Maliss cast a spell on me.

576
01:05:38,590 --> 01:05:42,150
But I swore I'd never stop
trying to protect you.

577
01:05:42,340 --> 01:05:46,090
Oh, I can't believe it's true!
-This time, Snow White,

578
01:05:46,420 --> 01:05:48,370
I'll never leave your side.

579
01:05:54,870 --> 01:05:57,140
If it weren't for your help,

580
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,720
I never would have 
seen my Prince again.

581
01:06:00,644 --> 01:06:03,484
Some of us were a little 
more helpful than others.

582
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:07,920
Honestly, Sunburn.
Must you take all the credit?

583
01:06:07,950 --> 01:06:09,230
Not me.

584
01:06:10,454 --> 01:06:14,654
Thunderella. You really 
came through.

585
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:19,050
We better be going. We'll be 
late for a certain wedding.

586
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:23,000
I want all of you to come.
Oh, and Seven Dwarfs too.

587
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,400
Is it all right, Mother Nature?

588
01:06:28,424 --> 01:06:30,106
Can we go to 
Snow White's wedding?

589
01:06:30,130 --> 01:06:32,490
Very well. But, 
when you return,

590
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,930
you're gonna have
to face the music.

591
01:06:34,954 --> 01:06:36,566
But, you mean... 
-Even after we...

592
01:06:36,590 --> 01:06:39,770
You're not still going to... 
-Take away their powers?

593
01:06:41,194 --> 01:06:44,194
Oh, gracious. No. 
They've proven themselves.

594
01:06:44,270 --> 01:06:47,110
When they return, they'll get 
right back to their old jobs.

595
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:54,970
And we will have two 
new apprentices to train.

596
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:16,260
Hey, I can breathe.
You know, Batso,

597
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:20,050
maybe working for this Mother 
Nature ain't gonna be so bad.

598
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:24,090
I can even smell again.
-With your cigar,

599
01:07:24,114 --> 01:07:26,314
you always smelled.

600
01:07:28,330 --> 01:07:31,010
Are you ready to live 
happily ever after?
