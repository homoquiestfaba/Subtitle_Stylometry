1
00:00:13,246 --> 00:00:15,948
<i>A brownstone on west 35th street, Manhattan.</i>

2
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:18,651
<i>Most people walk by without a second look.</i>

3
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,520
<i>This is Nero Wolfe's office.</i>

4
00:00:22,555 --> 00:00:25,158
<i>A man who thinks he's the world's greatest detective.</i>

5
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:28,194
<i>Truth being, he is.</i>

6
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:58,124
<i>Wolfe is punctual, especially about meals.</i>

7
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,607
<i>Breakfast at 8:00 in his room</i>

8
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,028
<i>Lunch at 12:30, dinner at 6:30.</i>

9
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:08,968
<i>He also weighs a seventh of a ton.</i>

10
00:01:46,498 --> 00:01:48,441
Evening.

11
00:01:49,742 --> 00:01:51,478
Good evening.

12
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,743
I went to the bank this afternoon.

13
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:02,322
Oh.

14
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:04,491
Would you like to have the news?

15
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:09,696
You're overdrawn.

16
00:02:11,994 --> 00:02:14,278
But the bank is hopeful.

17
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:16,202
I told them you have a ship coming in.

18
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,012
Smells great, Fritz.

19
00:02:30,047 --> 00:02:31,366
What is it?

20
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,685
Starlings.

21
00:02:33,466 --> 00:02:35,288
Delivered this morning.

22
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:37,457
Fresh.

23
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:43,746
The sage?

24
00:02:44,865 --> 00:02:45,663
No, sir.

25
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:47,938
What do you mean, "no, sir"?

26
00:02:47,973 --> 00:02:49,537
I thought you might like it once

27
00:02:49,572 --> 00:02:51,337
With saffron and tarragon.

28
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:52,730
Remove it.

29
00:02:52,765 --> 00:02:54,120
Oh, no, you don't understand.

30
00:02:54,155 --> 00:02:54,807
This is...

31
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:56,543
You did not consult me.

32
00:02:57,424 --> 00:02:58,826
To think that without warning

33
00:02:58,861 --> 00:03:00,229
One of my favorite dishes

34
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:01,439
has been radically altered

35
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:03,277
is an unpleasant shock.

36
00:03:03,312 --> 00:03:05,045
It may possibly be edible

37
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,833
but I am in no humor to risk it!

38
00:03:06,868 --> 00:03:08,551
Please dispose of it and bring me

39
00:03:08,586 --> 00:03:10,329
four coddled eggs and a piece of toast!

40
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:13,159
Fritz, I'll take some.

41
00:03:33,723 --> 00:03:35,547
Saffron, yeah.

42
00:03:36,324 --> 00:03:38,946
Mmm... really wonderful.

43
00:03:38,981 --> 00:03:41,568
Surprisingly little fat.

44
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:42,522
Thank you, sir.

45
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:46,175
And there's a glaze or something...

46
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,053
what did you use in that?

47
00:03:48,088 --> 00:03:49,862
That glaze is a secret

48
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,664
but I can tell you one ingredient.

49
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:55,443
Red currant.

50
00:03:55,478 --> 00:03:57,158
Red currant, yes.

51
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,851
And you like the saffron and tarragon?

52
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:01,682
He doesn't know what he's missing.

53
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:03,776
Thank you, sir.

54
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:11,017
Coffee, please, Fritz.

55
00:04:13,185 --> 00:04:14,018
Who's that?

56
00:04:14,679 --> 00:04:16,656
Someone who doesn't know the rules.

57
00:04:21,354 --> 00:04:22,746
Wrong number.

58
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:24,139
Guess again.

59
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:27,500
You're Archie Goodwin.

60
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,669
I got to see Nero Wolfe.

61
00:04:30,102 --> 00:04:31,404
What's your name?

62
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,289
Pete.

63
00:04:32,324 --> 00:04:33,104
Pete.

64
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,440
Got a last name, Pete?

65
00:04:34,475 --> 00:04:35,706
Drossos.

66
00:04:35,741 --> 00:04:37,476
And what do you want to see Mr. Wolfe about?

67
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:38,777
I got a case.

68
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:39,645
I'll tell him.

69
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:43,549
<i>Now, normally, I would run the kid along.</i>

70
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:45,683
Sure, Pete, come on in.

71
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,321
<i>But after Wolfe's childish performance with Fritz</i>

72
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:49,339
<i>It thought it would do him good</i>

73
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,791
<i>To have another child to play with.</i>

74
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:53,960
Right in here.

75
00:04:59,736 --> 00:05:03,069
Archie, I will not have interruptions at meals.

76
00:05:04,196 --> 00:05:05,844
You call eggs a meal?

77
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,616
This is Mr. Peter Drossos.

78
00:05:07,651 --> 00:05:09,702
He wants to consult you about a case.

79
00:05:09,737 --> 00:05:11,719
I was going to tell him you were busy

80
00:05:11,754 --> 00:05:13,285
but I remembered how sore you got at Fritz

81
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,067
'cause he didn't consult you.

82
00:05:14,102 --> 00:05:16,677
I didn't want you get sore at Pete 'cause he didn't consult you either.

83
00:05:16,712 --> 00:05:18,215
Sit down, Mr. Drossos.

84
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,419
<i>Dragging Wolfe is always a bit of a gamble.</i>

85
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:30,284
Turn a little more to face me, please.

86
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,699
Thank you.

87
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,252
You wish to consult me?

88
00:05:36,287 --> 00:05:37,770
Yeah, I got a case.

89
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:41,639
I always welcome a case

90
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,843
but timing is a little unfortunate

91
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:44,648
because Mr. Goodwin

92
00:05:44,683 --> 00:05:45,826
was going out this evening

93
00:05:45,861 --> 00:05:47,994
to see an important billiard match.

94
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:50,093
Now, of course He'll have to stay here

95
00:05:50,128 --> 00:05:52,952
to take down all that you say and all that I say.

96
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:54,218
Happily.

97
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:56,856
<i>Like I said, always a gamble.</i>

98
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,327
All right, young Pete, fire away.

99
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,965
Yeah, I guess it's okay... him taking it down

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,231
but I got to watch my end.

101
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,400
This is strictly under the lid.

102
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,037
If you mean it's confidential, certainly.

103
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,216
Then I'll spill it.

104
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,039
It happened about an hour ago.

105
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,286
I was at the corner of 35th and ninth

106
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:18,509
working the "wipe racket".

107
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,297
Please, what is the wipe racket?

108
00:06:21,332 --> 00:06:23,489
You know when a car stops at the light

109
00:06:23,524 --> 00:06:26,725
you, um, walk over with a rag and start wiping the window.

110
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,793
Anyway, this caddy stops for the light.

111
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,826
The window was closed, so I couldn't hear

112
00:06:30,861 --> 00:06:31,557
but she worked her lips.

113
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:34,473
Help. Get a cop.

114
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:35,933
The guy stuck a gun in her ribs

115
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:40,666
and I got a license plate; Connecticut Y-Y-9-4-3-2.

116
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:42,835
May I see it, please?

117
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,535
It's excellent.

118
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,305
So what do you think of this case I got?

119
00:06:46,941 --> 00:06:50,643
Well, it seems a little...

120
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:52,456
hazy.

121
00:06:52,491 --> 00:06:55,414
Okay, look, the car was a dark gray '52 Caddy.

122
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,911
The driver was a good-looker.

123
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,329
She had on big gold spiders for earrings.

124
00:06:59,364 --> 00:07:02,788
Spiders that stretched out like so; pure gold.

125
00:07:02,823 --> 00:07:04,284
Pure gold, huh?

126
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,874
Okay, it looked like pure gold.

127
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:08,427
Well, anyway, these people, they had bucks.

128
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,663
So I figure, if he kills her

129
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:13,941
and I identify him, I get a rewart for hanging on him.

130
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:17,184
But that's when I decided I need to come see you because

131
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:19,705
this case is too big for me to handle by myself.

132
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,891
So, I figure 50-50. What do you say?

133
00:07:22,427 --> 00:07:25,084
Archie, you have that licence number?

134
00:07:25,576 --> 00:07:27,016
Call Mr. Cramer's office

135
00:07:27,051 --> 00:07:28,422
and give them that number.

136
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:31,753
Say that you have information that that car, or its operator

137
00:07:31,788 --> 00:07:34,453
may have been involved in a violation of the law

138
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,205
in this city in the past hour

139
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,923
and suggest a routine check.

140
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,623
Do not be more definite.

141
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,976
Say that information is unverified.

142
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:44,294
And that inquiry should be discreet.

143
00:07:44,329 --> 00:07:44,987
Wait. Wait. Wait.

144
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,433
Who's this Mr. Cramer? A cop?

145
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:48,299
No, he's an inspector.

146
00:07:48,334 --> 00:07:51,888
You, yourself, suggested the possibly of murder, Pete.

147
00:07:51,923 --> 00:07:54,858
If there was a murder, there's a corpse.

148
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:57,443
If there's corpse, it should be found.

149
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:00,913
Unless, and until it is found, where's your case?

150
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,047
We have no idea where to look for it.

151
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:05,524
So, we'll trick the police into finding it for us.

152
00:08:05,559 --> 00:08:08,686
I often make use of them in that way.

153
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,757
Archie, of course, you will not mention Pete's name

154
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,926
since he doesn't want to be marked.

155
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,227
Call Cramer.

156
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,771
I called Manhattan homicide.

157
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:24,624
I couldn't reach Cramer

158
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:26,514
but I talked to detective Purley Stebbins.

159
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:27,686
I told him all about the case

160
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,429
and, of course, I didn't reveal the source.

161
00:08:29,464 --> 00:08:29,974
Excellent.

162
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:31,242
Now, your notebook.

163
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,012
Excuse me, what time is it?

164
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,747
Yes, it's four minutes to 8:00.

165
00:08:36,482 --> 00:08:38,217
I got to be home by a quarter to.

166
00:08:38,252 --> 00:08:39,559
See you tomorrow.

167
00:08:44,723 --> 00:08:48,194
After that, a billiard match would seem pretty dull.

168
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:51,251
But... might as well go.

169
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,533
Sir.

170
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:57,150
<i>The next afternoon</i>

171
00:08:57,185 --> 00:08:58,813
<i>Wolfe was having a beer relapse.</i>

172
00:08:58,848 --> 00:09:01,385
<i>He was trying to cut down to two quarts a day</i>

173
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,809
<i>And it wasn't going very well.</i>

174
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,769
See who that is and send them away.

175
00:09:11,473 --> 00:09:13,029
Well, I supposed of course, it was Pete

176
00:09:13,064 --> 00:09:15,189
but it wasn't; it was sergeant Purley Stebbins

177
00:09:15,224 --> 00:09:17,027
of Manhattan homicide west.

178
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:17,986
Nobody's home.

179
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:19,393
Nuts. I want to see Wolfe

180
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:20,257
and you.

181
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,255
All right, this is me.

182
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,208
I know that.

183
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:24,581
Now take me to Wolfe.

184
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,401
Yesterday evening you called me about a car.

185
00:09:29,436 --> 00:09:31,587
A dark gray Cadillac with Connecticut plates.

186
00:09:31,622 --> 00:09:33,501
I told you we had some information... not checked.

187
00:09:33,536 --> 00:09:34,771
That the car, the driver, the owner

188
00:09:34,806 --> 00:09:36,342
was involved in something.

189
00:09:36,377 --> 00:09:37,392
I know that.

190
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:39,378
Exactly what was your information and where did you get it?

191
00:09:39,413 --> 00:09:41,112
You asked me that yesterday, I passed. I still pass.

192
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:43,238
We don't want our informant to be annoyed.

193
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:44,051
Well, he's going to be.

194
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:45,677
Now, who was it and what did he tell you?

195
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:46,954
Nothing doing, Purley.

196
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,984
Now you know dam well this is just a bad habit of yours.

197
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,640
Now, if something happened that makes you feel

198
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:51,523
that I should tell you who and what

199
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:52,825
you tell me what happened

200
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,691
and see if I agree.

201
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,295
You know how reasonable I can be.

202
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,997
Couple of hours ago

203
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,211
a car stopped for a red light

204
00:09:59,212 --> 00:10:00,878
at the corner of 35th and ninth.

205
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:02,801
A boy with a rag starts wiping the window.

206
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:04,536
As he circles in front of the car

207
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,421
it jumps forward

208
00:10:05,456 --> 00:10:06,731
runs over the boy

209
00:10:06,766 --> 00:10:08,007
and keeps going.

210
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:12,743
The driver was a man alone.

211
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,685
Couple of people agreed on the plates:

212
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,557
Connecticut, Y-Y-Nine-Four-Three-Two.

213
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:20,484
The same dark-gray Cadillac, the same car you called me about yesterday.

214
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:22,228
The boy died in the hospital

215
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:24,846
shortly after the ambulance got him there.

216
00:10:25,357 --> 00:10:26,361
What was the boy's name?

217
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:27,365
What that got to do with it?

218
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,827
Just tell me his name.

219
00:10:28,862 --> 00:10:29,660
Drossos.

220
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,430
Peter Drossos.

221
00:10:33,314 --> 00:10:34,431
The son of a bitch.

222
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:35,768
Who, the boy?

223
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,069
No.

224
00:10:41,496 --> 00:10:43,253
Do you tell me or does he?

225
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:48,312
I wish you luck, Mr. Stebbins.

226
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,383
That boy ate at my table yesterday.

227
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:54,420
Yeah? Well, that makes it bad, huh?

228
00:10:54,853 --> 00:10:57,021
People got no business running over boys

229
00:10:57,022 --> 00:10:58,324
that ate at your table.

230
00:11:21,199 --> 00:11:22,614
Can I help you, madam?

231
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:25,217
Does Nero Wolfe live here?

232
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:26,659
Yes.

233
00:11:26,694 --> 00:11:28,253
Do you think I could see him?

234
00:11:28,288 --> 00:11:30,387
I won't take long.

235
00:11:30,422 --> 00:11:33,892
My name is Mrs. Anthea Drossos.

236
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:37,363
Yes, Mrs. Drossos.

237
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:44,303
You are Nero Wolfe?

238
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,569
I am.

239
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,039
And this gentlemen?

240
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:51,208
Sergeant Stebbins, homicide.

241
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,947
He is investigating the death of your son.

242
00:11:53,982 --> 00:11:56,651
My boy, Pete, would not want me to tell this

243
00:11:56,686 --> 00:11:58,417
in front of a cop.

244
00:11:58,452 --> 00:11:59,918
I'll be in the kitchen.

245
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:01,220
Asrchie?

246
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:16,800
Well, madam...

247
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,305
You know my boy was killed.

248
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:25,511
Mom?

249
00:12:25,944 --> 00:12:27,246
I'm here, Pete.

250
00:12:28,981 --> 00:12:31,115
Go to Mr. Wolfe.

251
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,017
Tell him what happened.

252
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,487
We're almost at the hospital.

253
00:12:35,498 --> 00:12:38,524
The can where I keep my money.

254
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,078
Give Mr. Wolfe the money.

255
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,898
Hold on, Pete, hold on.

256
00:12:46,331 --> 00:12:47,633
Tell him to find...

257
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:52,187
tell him to find the guy that ran me down.

258
00:12:52,222 --> 00:12:56,308
Tell him to find... tell him to find...

259
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,468
Here is Pete's money.

260
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:03,682
He made it himself.

261
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,935
Do you understand?

262
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:09,755
Yes, I understand.

263
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:14,526
Archie?

264
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,563
This way.

265
00:13:36,648 --> 00:13:38,240
$4.30.

266
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,650
A hearty congratulations to you.

267
00:13:39,685 --> 00:13:41,541
I figure after deducting for income tax

268
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:43,626
and the ten cents call to Stebbins

269
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,855
there's enough left over

270
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,059
to put a pool over here or...

271
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:48,360
Shut up!

272
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:50,095
Will you return that to her tomorrow?

273
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,351
I will not return it tomorrow or any other day.

274
00:13:52,386 --> 00:13:52,914
You know that's impossible.

275
00:13:52,949 --> 00:13:54,398
Give it to the red cross!

276
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,186
You give it to the red cross!

277
00:13:56,221 --> 00:13:57,904
Should that woman come back

278
00:13:57,939 --> 00:13:59,203
and ask what we did with Pete's money

279
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:00,506
I'm not going to feel like saying the red cross

280
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,829
and I'm not going to lie.

281
00:14:01,864 --> 00:14:03,574
You brought him into this house!

282
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,020
This is your house!

283
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,012
You gave the boy cookies!

284
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,085
You ate a couple of the cookies.

285
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,837
What?

286
00:14:14,872 --> 00:14:16,364
Nothing.

287
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,821
What?

288
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:18,689
I didn't have a cookie.

289
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,458
I did not have a single cookie.

290
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:21,760
You had a couple of them.

291
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,569
Well, you've always said

292
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:34,990
it's not so much that you earn the money

293
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:37,376
but to feel like you've earned the money.

294
00:14:37,411 --> 00:14:39,111
So why don't we earn our money?

295
00:14:39,146 --> 00:14:41,245
"Woman with spider earrings

296
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,316
"who on Tuesday at the corner of ninth and 35th street

297
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,477
"silently asked a young boy to get the police:

298
00:14:47,512 --> 00:14:49,539
"please communicate with Nero Wolfe

299
00:14:49,574 --> 00:14:52,089
at the address in the phone book. "

300
00:14:52,124 --> 00:14:54,032
There's enough there to run an ad in the Mirror

301
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,895
and if not, I'll throw in a few bucks.

302
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,064
I regard that as brilliant.

303
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,233
We're using Pete's money

304
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,534
for Pete.

305
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,065
And since there's no chance there'll be a nibble

306
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,438
it won't expose you to any work.

307
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,306
What do you say?

308
00:15:08,513 --> 00:15:09,474
Very well.

309
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:15,113
Tell Cohen it has to appear in tonight's edition.

310
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,415
Don't explain.

311
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,015
<i>It was almost noon</i>

312
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,861
<i>when the ad in the Mirror had baited the first fish...</i>

313
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:31,163
<i>our old friend, inspector Cramer.</i>

314
00:15:31,909 --> 00:15:33,332
Where's Wolfe?

315
00:15:33,765 --> 00:15:34,633
Inspector Cramer.

316
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,980
I don't think he's expecting you.

317
00:15:37,015 --> 00:15:37,903
Damn right, he isn't.

318
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,404
Archie, this is farcical.

319
00:15:39,838 --> 00:15:41,712
Why did you put that ad in the Mirror?

320
00:15:41,747 --> 00:15:42,961
I do not use brassavolas

321
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:44,176
in trigeneric crosses.

322
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,080
Now, your notebook, Archie.

323
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,615
Dear Mr. Jordan...

324
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:50,817
I asked you why...

325
00:15:50,852 --> 00:15:52,732
Dear Mr. Jordan...

326
00:15:52,767 --> 00:15:53,250
in reference to the orchids...

327
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:55,453
You put that ad

328
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:56,286
In the Mirror.

329
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:57,622
...in performing...

330
00:15:57,657 --> 00:15:58,924
Damn it, Wolfe!

331
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:01,999
In specific reference to Vanda Caerulea...

332
00:16:02,034 --> 00:16:04,129
I asked a civil question.

333
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,395
Civil?

334
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,497
Civilize it.

335
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,564
Put it your way.

336
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:09,768
Do you know that woman with the spider earrings?

337
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,601
Archie?

338
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,503
I have no idea.

339
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:12,371
Back to the letter.

340
00:16:12,406 --> 00:16:13,637
Yes, please.

341
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:14,973
Please, let's get back to it.

342
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:16,275
You're covering up something.

343
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,576
Or someone.

344
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,745
Did you ever hear of Matthew Birch?

345
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,242
Yes.

346
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:21,095
Oh, so you have?

347
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:21,913
Would you tell me

348
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,180
when and where?

349
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:25,167
It's in the newspaper.

350
00:16:25,937 --> 00:16:27,551
Here... as reported.

351
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:28,385
"The body of a man

352
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,155

It is thought a car ran over him. "

356
00:16:35,195 --> 00:16:38,198
Except for newspaper and radio items

357
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:38,795
connected with his death

358
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,999
had you ever seen or heard of him?

359
00:16:41,433 --> 00:16:42,200
Under that name?

360
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,567
Under that or under any name!

361
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,771
Not to my knowledge.

362
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:46,603
Go back.

363
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:48,373
Have you got the spelling?

364
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,252
V- A-N-D-A C-E-R-U-L-A

365
00:16:50,287 --> 00:16:52,132
E- A.

366
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,977
E- A?

367
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:57,049
Do you have any reason to suspect or suppose

368
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,452
that the man found dead in the alley

369
00:16:59,487 --> 00:17:01,820
was someone you had seen or heard of

370
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:04,097
in any connection whatsoever?

371
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:06,092
Ah, that's more like it.

372
00:17:06,127 --> 00:17:07,877
That settles it.

373
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:09,420
The answer is no.

374
00:17:09,455 --> 00:17:10,894
May I ask one?

375
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:13,063
Have you any reason to suppose or suspect

376
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:15,267
that the answer should be yes?

377
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:18,275
Well, here's the complication:

378
00:17:19,315 --> 00:17:22,641
the car that killed that boy was found on 186th street

379
00:17:22,676 --> 00:17:24,810
with the Connecticut plates still on it.

380
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:28,280
Technicians work out on it all morning.

381
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,750
They clinched it that it killed the boy.

382
00:17:31,785 --> 00:17:33,919
Caught tight underneath the car

383
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:38,256
was a piece of cloth the size of a man's hand

384
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,738
torn from the flap of jacket

385
00:17:40,773 --> 00:17:43,895
worn by a man named Matthew Birch.

386
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,064
So...

387
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,872
The same car that killed that boy...

388
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,041
ran over Matthew Birch.

389
00:17:57,022 --> 00:17:58,374
Do you agree?

390
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:00,344
For a working hypothesis...

391
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,114
Well that's the point!

392
00:18:02,149 --> 00:18:03,849
Wou are working on it. You put that ad in!

393
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:07,753
I'll stipulate that I am capable of flummery...

394
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:12,456
That I have on occasion gulled and hoaxed you, inspector

395
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:16,727
but you know I eschew the crudeness of an explicit lie.

396
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:19,607
I tell you, I have no client in this matter.

397
00:18:20,332 --> 00:18:21,633
Now, I will admit that the evidence

398
00:18:21,668 --> 00:18:24,472
that the boy and Matthew Birch...

399
00:18:24,507 --> 00:18:25,258
Nero Wolfe's office.

400
00:18:25,293 --> 00:18:28,573
...being killed by the same car is a noteworthy complication.

401
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,176
But that should make things easier for you.

402
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:33,345
Even though the license plate may be useless.

403
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,220
Surely you can trace the car itself.

404
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:36,517
Yeah, well, we have.

405
00:18:36,552 --> 00:18:38,360
It was stolen four months ago in Baltimore.

406
00:18:38,395 --> 00:18:40,310
It's been repainted twice.

407
00:18:44,092 --> 00:18:46,358
Well, that was, um...

408
00:18:46,393 --> 00:18:47,676
interesting.

409
00:18:47,711 --> 00:18:48,925
It was a, uh...

410
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,563
telephone call in reference to...

411
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:53,697
orchids.

412
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,467
Thank you, Archie.

413
00:19:00,367 --> 00:19:01,505
Okay.

414
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,716
Um, you know, I've never had any notion

415
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:07,612
that you're a crude liar, Wolfe.

416
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,215
I've never seen you be crude.

417
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:14,553
No...

418
00:19:15,601 --> 00:19:17,155
Not crude.

419
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:21,927
You're nice.

420
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,765
Archie, I- I- I'm not happy with...

421
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,433
Wait, wait, wait.

422
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:29,734
The phone call.

423
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:30,567
Hmm?

424
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:32,302
It was...

425
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,471
a woman answering the ad.

426
00:19:35,238 --> 00:19:36,675
She wouldn't give her name, uh...

427
00:19:37,976 --> 00:19:39,814
Uh, she made an appointment.

428
00:19:40,613 --> 00:19:41,845
It's lunch.

429
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,265
Uh, she made an appointment

430
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,651
for 20 minutes from now.

431
00:19:49,598 --> 00:19:51,423
Archie, this is insufferable.

432
00:19:52,096 --> 00:19:53,158
So...

433
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,881
Dear Mr. Jordan...

434
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,397
"dear Mr. Jordan... "

435
00:20:21,749 --> 00:20:22,576
Mr. Wolfe?

436
00:20:22,611 --> 00:20:24,150
No, I'm Archie Goodwin

437
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:25,690
Mr. Wolfe's assistant.

438
00:20:26,489 --> 00:20:27,859
Right on the dot.

439
00:20:30,462 --> 00:20:32,631
I am usually punctual.

440
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:36,066
What can I do for you, madam?

441
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:38,486
This is a clipping of your advertisement.

442
00:20:38,521 --> 00:20:40,872
And this is a check made out to you for $500.

443
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,607
May I see it, please?

444
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:43,874
Not yet.

445
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,860
It has my name on it.

446
00:20:45,895 --> 00:20:47,777
So I would guess.

447
00:20:47,812 --> 00:20:51,716
I want to ask you some things before I give you my name.

448
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:52,983
What things?

449
00:20:53,763 --> 00:20:57,532
About the boy... the boy I asked to see a cop.

450
00:20:58,575 --> 00:20:59,946
I would like to see him.

451
00:20:59,981 --> 00:21:02,092
Will you arrange for me to see him?

452
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:06,021
If you could just give me his name and address

453
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,586
I think that that woud be enough for the $500.

454
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:09,900
Describe the boy.

455
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,086
Describe the other occupants of the car.

456
00:21:13,121 --> 00:21:14,238
What time did it happen?

457
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,356
What did the boy say?

458
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,198
Exactly what did he do?

459
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,575
As for your name

460
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,465
that is no longer in your discretion.

461
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,611
Mr. Goodwin seizes

462
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,815
your bag... by force, if necessary...

463
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,544
and examines its contents.

464
00:21:25,579 --> 00:21:27,285
If you complain, we are two to one.

465
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,020
Sit down, madam!

466
00:21:32,618 --> 00:21:35,492
I like eyes at a level.

467
00:21:35,527 --> 00:21:38,129
Sit down and we'll discuss it.

468
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:40,298
But first, the name.

469
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,058
My driving license.

470
00:21:50,746 --> 00:21:52,010
I am Mrs. Laura Fromm.

471
00:21:52,045 --> 00:21:53,276
I am a widow.

472
00:21:53,311 --> 00:21:55,188
My New York residence is...

473
00:21:55,223 --> 00:21:56,155
I've noted it.

474
00:21:57,011 --> 00:21:58,237
You still maintain

475
00:21:58,272 --> 00:22:00,466
you were driving the car, and told the boy to get a cop?

476
00:22:00,501 --> 00:22:02,310
I do, most certainly.

477
00:22:02,345 --> 00:22:04,120
Then you're in a pickle.

478
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,031
The police want to question you

479
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:08,059
about a murder.

480
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:11,371
Yesterday, a car ran over the boy

481
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:13,693
and killed him... intentionally.

482
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,631
What are you saying?

483
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:19,302
It was the same car...

484
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,941
the one you profess to be driving

485
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:24,109
when you spoke to the boy.

486
00:22:24,542 --> 00:22:25,844
I don't believe it.

487
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:27,110
You will.

488
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,429
The police will explain to you

489
00:22:28,464 --> 00:22:29,713
how they know it was the same car.

490
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:31,916
There's no question about it, Mrs. Fromm.

491
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:34,902
I am not assuming that you were driving the car

492
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:37,520
that killed the boy, but I tell you

493
00:22:37,555 --> 00:22:40,592
merely by being drawn to me by that advertisement

494
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,194
and coming rigged in those earrings

495
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,894
you have put your foot in it.

496
00:22:44,929 --> 00:22:48,399
And if you stick to it that you were driving the car

497
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,870
you will have fully qualified as a feeble-minded donkey.

498
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,340
I was not...

499
00:22:56,207 --> 00:22:58,376
driving the car.

500
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,545
That's better.

501
00:23:02,304 --> 00:23:04,814
Where were you Tuesday evening between 6:30 and 7:00?

502
00:23:04,849 --> 00:23:06,149
At an executive meeting

503
00:23:06,184 --> 00:23:08,787
for the aid to european refugees.

504
00:23:08,822 --> 00:23:11,554
And the following day, Wednesday?

505
00:23:11,589 --> 00:23:12,222
Where was I?

506
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:14,214
Same time... 6:30 to 7:00?

507
00:23:14,249 --> 00:23:15,317
What is has got?

508
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:20,964
That's when he was struck and killed.

509
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,872
I was having tea with a friend.

510
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:29,758
The friend's name, please?

511
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,450
The friend's name is Paul Kuffner...

512
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:33,078
my publicist.

513
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,091
This is a check

514
00:23:46,524 --> 00:23:47,825
for $10,000.

515
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:50,503
I see it is.

516
00:23:50,538 --> 00:23:51,943
It's a retainer.

517
00:23:51,978 --> 00:23:52,597
For what?

518
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,633
It seems as though I'm going to need your expert advice

519
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:56,952
and maybe your help.

520
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:58,201
Bosh. You're offering

521
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,356
to pay me not to tell the police of your visit.

522
00:24:00,391 --> 00:24:02,825
I am Mrs. Damon Fromm.

523
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,390
My husband left me a large fortune.

524
00:24:06,425 --> 00:24:09,885
I have position and responsibilities.

525
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,222
If you would to report my visit to the police, I would arrange

526
00:24:14,257 --> 00:24:16,419
to see the commissioner.

527
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:20,792
So... if you would come to my home tomorrow...

528
00:24:20,827 --> 00:24:23,394
I don't go to people's homes.

529
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,962
Fine.

530
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,732
Then I will come here

531
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:29,484
at noon.

532
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:31,487
Until then

533
00:24:31,522 --> 00:24:34,672
you will not report my coming here.

534
00:24:37,275 --> 00:24:40,169
I want to...

535
00:24:40,204 --> 00:24:42,707
I must see someone.

536
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:46,053
I must try to find out something.

537
00:24:46,088 --> 00:24:48,119
If I don't, you may inform the police.

538
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:52,114
If I do, I will need your advice

539
00:24:52,149 --> 00:24:54,830
and probably your help.

540
00:24:54,865 --> 00:24:57,345
That's what the $10,000 is for.

541
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,826
Archie, is she Mrs. Damon Fromm?

542
00:25:00,647 --> 00:25:01,531
I would say yes

543
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,301
but I wouldn't sign it.

544
00:25:03,735 --> 00:25:06,083
Archie, go to Mr. Cohen's office and ask to see pictures

545
00:25:06,118 --> 00:25:07,429
of Mrs. Damon Fromm.

546
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,705
Phone me from there.

547
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,976
You will stay here with me.

548
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:13,711
This is ridiculous.

549
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,722
No doubt, but under the circumstances

550
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:17,907
not unreasonable.

551
00:25:17,942 --> 00:25:19,611
Do you refuse?

552
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:21,246
No. I deserve it.

553
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:22,387
It isn't necessary, Archie.

554
00:25:22,422 --> 00:25:24,087
You are Mrs. Fromm.

555
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,689
Before you leave, an understanding:

556
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:29,977
my decision whether to accept your retainer

557
00:25:30,012 --> 00:25:33,231
and work for you will be made tomorrow.

558
00:25:33,266 --> 00:25:35,684
You are not now my client.

559
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:37,152
Understood.

560
00:25:37,187 --> 00:25:38,835
And a question:

561
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:42,140
do you know who the woman was

562
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:44,943
who was driving the car Tuesday and spoke to the boy?

563
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:48,996
I won't answer that now because I can't.

564
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:51,015
I really don't know.

565
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:52,317
But you think you know?

566
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,128
I won't answer it.

567
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:55,353
Have you ever seen or heard

568
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:57,322
of a man named Matthew Birch?

569
00:25:57,357 --> 00:25:58,507
No. Why?

570
00:25:58,542 --> 00:26:00,161
A man of that name

571
00:26:00,196 --> 00:26:04,675
was run over and killed by a car Tuesday night

572
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,932
and it was the same car that killed the boy Wednesday.

573
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,201
Since the car itself

574
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:13,507
cannot be supposed ruthless and malign

575
00:26:13,542 --> 00:26:16,778
someone associated with it must be.

576
00:26:16,813 --> 00:26:19,175
I am warning you

577
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:21,379
not to be foolhardy...

578
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:23,548
or even imprudent.

579
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,406
<i>Mrs. Fromm extended her hand.</i>

580
00:26:28,441 --> 00:26:31,155
<i>Wolfe doesn't usually rise when a woman enters or leaves</i>

581
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:31,754
<i>but it was lunch time</i>

582
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,091
<i>and the hand was in the way.</i>

583
00:26:33,524 --> 00:26:35,260
<i>I walked Mrs. Fromm to the door</i>

584
00:26:35,295 --> 00:26:36,526
<i>spent the rest of the day</i>

585
00:26:36,561 --> 00:26:38,730
<i>making sure her check was bona fide.</i>

586
00:26:46,217 --> 00:26:48,556
That woman is 18 minutes late

587
00:26:48,591 --> 00:26:53,044
and I shall not permit this to interfere with my lunch.

588
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,213
She must have heard you.

589
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:02,803
I'm Denis Horan, counselor-at-law.

590
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:05,623
James Albert Maddox, also an attorney.

591
00:27:05,658 --> 00:27:07,098
There's been a terrible tragedy.

592
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:09,093
We must see Nero Wolfe.

593
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:12,528
Mrs. Fromm's body was found an hour ago.

594
00:27:12,563 --> 00:27:15,600
She was apparently run over by an automobile.

595
00:27:19,682 --> 00:27:21,673
Is that the reason you've come to see me?

596
00:27:22,106 --> 00:27:24,186
Mrs. Fromm was a former friend and client.

597
00:27:24,221 --> 00:27:25,108
Not your client.

598
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:25,872
I advised her.

599
00:27:25,907 --> 00:27:26,865
Badly.

600
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,047
Perhaps it would be well for each of you to tell me...

601
00:27:29,082 --> 00:27:31,180
without interruption...

602
00:27:31,215 --> 00:27:34,212
to what extent, and with what authority

603
00:27:34,247 --> 00:27:34,920
you represent Mrs. Fromm.

604
00:27:34,955 --> 00:27:37,118
I represent Mrs. Fromm.

605
00:27:37,153 --> 00:27:37,687
You do not.

606
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,900
My firm is counsel to Mrs. Fromm.

607
00:27:39,935 --> 00:27:40,290
I am counsel

608
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:43,100
for the association of european refugees.

609
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:43,361
I am also

610
00:27:43,795 --> 00:27:45,530
executor of Mrs. Fromm's estate.

611
00:27:46,592 --> 00:27:47,230
And in that capacity, Mr. Wolfe

612
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:50,156
I ask you formally, under what conditions

613
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:51,096
and for what purpose

614
00:27:51,131 --> 00:27:54,205
did she give you a check for $10,000?

615
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,940
I prefer not to tell you.

616
00:27:57,057 --> 00:27:58,222
Do you know the law, Mr. Wolfe?

617
00:27:58,257 --> 00:27:59,027
No.

618
00:27:59,062 --> 00:28:01,115
Then I suggest you to seek advice.

619
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:03,764
I can compel you to disgorge that check

620
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:05,105
Unless you can establish

621
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,218
that Mrs. Fromm received value for it.

622
00:28:07,253 --> 00:28:09,187
I can't. She received nothing.

623
00:28:09,222 --> 00:28:11,122
But I intend to earn that money.

624
00:28:11,157 --> 00:28:11,990
How?

625
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:13,441
By making sure

626
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:15,893
her murderer is exposed and punished.

627
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:17,195
That's ridiculous.

628
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,930
We'll see.

629
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:22,723
Am I correct, sir

630
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:25,023
in assuming that you are not demanding

631
00:28:25,058 --> 00:28:28,039
that I return the money Mrs. Fromm paid me?

632
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,305
That depends.

633
00:28:30,282 --> 00:28:31,040
Tell me under what arrangement

634
00:28:31,075 --> 00:28:33,241
and for what purpose the check was made out

635
00:28:33,276 --> 00:28:34,510
and I will consider the matter.

636
00:28:34,545 --> 00:28:36,714
No, sir. I will tell you nothing whatsoever

637
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,581
of the conversation I had with Mrs. Fromm.

638
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:40,114
Then you're withholding evidence.

639
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:42,353
Phooey! I will report it to the police...

640
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,088
in writing... signed.

641
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:44,956
Archie?

642
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,084
And why not to me?

643
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,379
Because I'm not a simpleton.

644
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:50,604
Because I have reason to think

645
00:28:50,639 --> 00:28:53,197
that the conversation that I had with Mrs. Fromm

646
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,800
was one of the links in a chain that led to her death.

647
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,066
And if that is so

648
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:59,704
the person most eager to know what she said to me

649
00:28:59,739 --> 00:29:01,005
is probably her murderer.

650
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:02,705
Nonsense.

651
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,126
I am not her murderer.

652
00:29:05,161 --> 00:29:07,512
That remains to be seen.

653
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:08,778
This is a sham.

654
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:12,891
You're not interested in finding the killer of my client.

655
00:29:13,083 --> 00:29:14,084
Excuse me.

656
00:29:15,319 --> 00:29:17,324
You're only interested in the $10,000.

657
00:29:20,108 --> 00:29:21,406
I'm going to replevy that money.

658
00:29:21,441 --> 00:29:22,705
Archie, call inspector Cramer.

659
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,900
Wait a minute.

660
00:29:23,935 --> 00:29:25,695
You're making a mistake, Wolfe.

661
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,465
You say you want to investigate a murder

662
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,973
yet you have two of the people

663
00:29:29,008 --> 00:29:31,149
closest to Mrs. Fromm here in your office

664
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,392
and you chase one of them out!

665
00:29:32,427 --> 00:29:36,348
Bosh! Will you describe, fully and frankly

666
00:29:36,383 --> 00:29:39,177
the course and nature of your relations with Mrs. Fromm?

667
00:29:39,212 --> 00:29:40,443
Certainly not.

668
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,377
If I send Mr. Goodwin to the office

669
00:29:42,412 --> 00:29:44,277
of the association of european refugees

670
00:29:44,312 --> 00:29:45,490
will you instruct the staff

671
00:29:45,525 --> 00:29:48,201
to answer his questions fully and freely?

672
00:29:48,236 --> 00:29:48,684
No. I...

673
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,888
Then I have little use for you.

674
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:53,057
Archie, show Mr. Horan to the door.

675
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,536
Counselor.

676
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:04,415
<i>I wasn't sure Mrs. Fromm would like to be called a socialite.</i>

677
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,383
<i>It didn't seem very dignified, but then, it isn't dignified</i>

678
00:30:07,418 --> 00:30:09,540
<i>to be murdered by a car, either.</i>

679
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:10,842
Hey, Lon!

680
00:30:10,877 --> 00:30:11,670
Hey!

681
00:30:11,705 --> 00:30:13,845
Well, well, well, so Nero Wolfe is on the case.

682
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,955
I was just passing by.

683
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,478
I wanted to ask a few questions.

684
00:30:18,782 --> 00:30:20,678
What do you know about Nora Fromm's activities

685
00:30:20,713 --> 00:30:22,553
the day she was killed?

686
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:23,855
What do I get?

687
00:30:24,288 --> 00:30:26,674
Appreciation, respect... trust me.

688
00:30:26,709 --> 00:30:29,060
Eh... all right, start with lunch

689
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:31,627
at the Churchill, Paul Kaffner...

690
00:30:31,662 --> 00:30:33,596
public relations guy for the A.E.R.

691
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,531
The association for european refugees.

692
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,301
Kuffner told the cops she was worried about something.

693
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,001
What happened after lunch?

694
00:30:39,036 --> 00:30:40,540
Went back to the A.E.R. office

695
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,343
where a Mrs. Wright, executive-something

696
00:30:42,378 --> 00:30:44,675
says she spent their time going over the books.

697
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,596
Then Fromm goes home

698
00:30:46,631 --> 00:30:49,447
meets her personal secretary, friend and confidante.

699
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:50,612
Named?

700
00:30:50,647 --> 00:30:53,351
Jean Estey. Estey helps her get dressed for dinner.

701
00:30:53,386 --> 00:30:55,087
The buter said they had some argument.

702
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:56,786
Where's dinner?

703
00:30:56,821 --> 00:30:58,556
Denis Horan's apartment.

704
00:30:58,591 --> 00:30:59,388
Yeah? Who's there?

705
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:01,158
Just Horan, his wife Claire

706
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,894
Angela Wright and Paul Kuffner.

707
00:31:03,327 --> 00:31:04,594
Dinner breaks early.

708
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:08,064
Rumor is, Horan was overly familiar with Mrs. Fromm

709
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:11,135
so he walks her back to the car and watches her drive away.

710
00:31:11,248 --> 00:31:14,172
Yeah, so he was the last man to see her alive, huh?

711
00:31:14,207 --> 00:31:15,473
As far as is known.

712
00:31:15,907 --> 00:31:19,377
Listen, uh, anything new on this, uh, Matthew Birch guy?

713
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,678
What's Matthew Birch got to do with it?

714
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,508
Are you saying his murder's connected to Fromm?

715
00:31:24,582 --> 00:31:26,614
Eh, what else you know about the guy, huh?

716
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:27,793
He's a special agent

717
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:29,600
for immigration and naturalization services.

718
00:31:29,635 --> 00:31:31,683
Married, seems to live above his means.

719
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:33,257
What do you got?

720
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,426
Eh, the cops seem to have it wrapped up

721
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,167
that the same car that killed the kid

722
00:31:37,202 --> 00:31:38,427
killed Birch.

723
00:31:38,462 --> 00:31:40,667
Hey, and Fromm was killed by a car also.

724
00:31:40,702 --> 00:31:41,733
That's sweet, Archie.

725
00:31:41,768 --> 00:31:43,199
That's very sweet.

726
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,403
So who hired Nero Wolfe?

727
00:31:45,438 --> 00:31:47,537
Nope. Not yet.

728
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,705
Hey, what you mean? Come on! Come on!

729
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,343
I promise you I'll give you an exclusive later.

730
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,078
Hey Arch...!

731
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,116
No tasting.

732
00:32:01,091 --> 00:32:02,727
I wasn't tasting. I was sampling.

733
00:32:02,753 --> 00:32:04,922
You must explain to me the difference someday.

734
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,657
Inspector Cramer was here.

735
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:08,728
Any blood flow?

736
00:32:08,763 --> 00:32:11,051
You'll have to ask him yourself.

737
00:32:13,647 --> 00:32:16,070
<i>The top floor was devoted to Wolfe's second obsession:</i>

738
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:17,466
<i>Orchids.</i>

739
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:19,887
Eh, cattleyas.

740
00:32:20,356 --> 00:32:22,885
Wrong. Andropium.

741
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:26,696
What information did you obtain from Mr. Cohen?

742
00:32:26,731 --> 00:32:31,382
Well, miss Fromm had quite a busy social schedule...

743
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,082
<i>And so I told him.</i>

744
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,286
<i>Wolfe sat there with eyes closed and nose twitching.</i>

745
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,455
...her publicist Mr. Kuffner...

746
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:42,660
<i>When I finished, he held his pose for a long moment</i>

747
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:45,263
<i>absorbing everything... I think.</i>

748
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:49,284
<i>Then he opened his eyes.</i>

749
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,027
Cramer was here.

750
00:32:53,062 --> 00:32:54,469
Yes. So Fritz said.

751
00:32:54,504 --> 00:32:56,072
Yes. He was uncommonly offensive.

752
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,709
He intimated that had I told him yesterday

753
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,312
of Mrs. Fromm's visit, she would not...

754
00:33:01,347 --> 00:33:03,047
have been killed.

755
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,648
He was insufferable.

756
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:11,423
How old is Jean Estey?

757
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,752
Lon didn't specify.

758
00:33:13,787 --> 00:33:16,156
He thought young, I suppose under 30.

759
00:33:16,191 --> 00:33:16,892
Why?

760
00:33:16,927 --> 00:33:18,229
Is she comely?

761
00:33:18,264 --> 00:33:19,096
No data.

762
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,699
Get her and bring her here.

763
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:23,868
<i>"Get her and bring her here. "</i>

764
00:33:23,903 --> 00:33:25,568
<i>Well, that's Nero Wolfe.</i>

765
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,555
<i>How was I even going to get to see Jean Estey?</i>

766
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,915
<i>I concocted and rejected four different plans.</i>

767
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,676
Yes...?

768
00:33:31,711 --> 00:33:33,728
Uh, yes, there seems to be some confusion

769
00:33:33,763 --> 00:33:35,145
about the flower arrangements for the funeral.

770
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:37,315
I must consult with miss Estey immediately.

771
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,616
Mr. Goodwin is the name.

772
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:40,354
This way, please.

773
00:33:40,389 --> 00:33:41,994
Thank you.

774
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:49,026
What's this about flowers?

775
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:51,160
Miss Jean Estey?

776
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,763
Yes. What about flowers?

777
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:55,750
Yes, that's why I've come to see you.

778
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:57,702
Have you heard the name "Nero Wolfe"?

779
00:33:57,737 --> 00:33:58,569
The detective?

780
00:33:58,604 --> 00:33:59,437
Yes.

781
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,371
Well, certainly.

782
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:02,872
Good. He sent me.

783
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:04,607
Mr. Wolfe would like to know

784
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,244
if there would be any objection to orchids...

785
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:11,547
miltonia roezlii alba.

786
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,486
They're pure white and... quite beautiful.

787
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,383
Eh, grief... grief.

788
00:34:22,418 --> 00:34:24,436
I'm quite accustomed.

789
00:34:24,471 --> 00:34:26,454
We have it under control.

790
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,499
Thank you, thank you.

791
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,800
You-You see...

792
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:31,102
pardon?

793
00:34:33,704 --> 00:34:36,884
What started me was the way you're dressed.

794
00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:38,663
Ot, it's grotesque.

795
00:34:38,698 --> 00:34:41,512
Yes, well, the costume merely got me in.

796
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,080
Why, yes, I understand...

797
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,850
under false pretenses, and what for?

798
00:34:46,283 --> 00:34:47,983
Mr. Wolfe would like to invite you to dinner.

799
00:34:48,018 --> 00:34:50,187
Are you aware that Mrs. Fromm gave Mr. Wolfe a check

800
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,454
for $10,000 yesterday?

801
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,657
Yes. I handle her personal checking account.

802
00:34:53,692 --> 00:34:55,826
Ah. Did she tell you what the check was for?

803
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,128
No.

804
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:58,828
Well, I can't tell you, either.

805
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,993
But I can tell you that Mr. Wolfe feels responsible

806
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:02,003
for Mrs. Fromm

807
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:05,334
and feels an obligation to investigate her death.

808
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,538
Oh, the police are investigating it.

809
00:35:08,068 --> 00:35:10,347
Two of them left here just a half an hour ago.

810
00:35:10,382 --> 00:35:12,274
Yes, yes, the police.

811
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:13,811
I'm sure they'll do a very fine job

812
00:35:13,846 --> 00:35:14,664
and they'll solve it.

813
00:35:14,699 --> 00:35:16,647
But if they don't, Mr. Wolfe will.

814
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:21,852
Don't you... want Mr. Wolfe to solve it?

815
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:24,420
It doesn't matter what I want.

816
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,928
Well, it matters to Mr. Wolfe, and that's why

817
00:35:25,963 --> 00:35:27,509
he's inviting you to dinner.

818
00:35:27,544 --> 00:35:28,864
Our offices are at 35th street.

819
00:35:28,899 --> 00:35:30,961
We could be there in 15 minutes. Shall we go?

820
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:31,853
Oh, go now?

821
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:32,380
Yes.

822
00:35:32,415 --> 00:35:35,227
Oh, no. Look, I may be

823
00:35:35,262 --> 00:35:38,005
in the middle of this mess

824
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,923
but I'm not going to say or do anything

825
00:35:39,958 --> 00:35:41,806
to make it worse than it already is.

826
00:35:41,841 --> 00:35:43,020
Now, I've been instructed...

827
00:35:43,055 --> 00:35:44,164
Miss Estey! There you are.

828
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:46,143
Archie Goodwin. I work for Nero Wolfe.

829
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,028
I'm in disguise.

830
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,196
I'm Paul Kuffner.

831
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,145
I...

832
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,845
handle public relations for Mrs. Fromm

833
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,951
and I am not in disguise.

834
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:56,520
Sorry to break in like this and take miss Estey away

835
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,722
but there are urgent matters.

836
00:35:59,156 --> 00:36:00,423
Upstairs, please, miss Estey.

837
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,409
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Goodwin.

838
00:36:02,444 --> 00:36:04,270
I've heard a great deal about you and Mr. Wolfe.

839
00:36:04,305 --> 00:36:06,096
Ah, Beecham, Mr. Goodwin is leaving.

840
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,398
See him to the door, would you?

841
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,420
<i>It was a fine job.</i>

842
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:10,276
<i>He could have said, "get out of this house 'til I ask</i>

843
00:36:10,311 --> 00:36:13,037
<i>Miss Estey what you're trying to put over. "</i>

844
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,303
<i>But no, sir.</i>

845
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:17,808
Gentlemen, uh, Fritz has provided us with some...

846
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,942
lovely homemade cookies

847
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,296
in case any of you is interested.

848
00:36:22,331 --> 00:36:23,621
Napkins are provided.

849
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:25,182
Hello, everyone!

850
00:36:25,217 --> 00:36:26,718
I'm a mortician.

851
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:27,768
Saul, Fred, Orrie.

852
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:29,970
<i>Saul, Fred and Orrie, our best freelance operatives</i>

853
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:32,148
<i>were waiting when I got back to the office.</i>

854
00:36:32,183 --> 00:36:34,291
So you went to miss Estey dressed as...?

855
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,593
A mortician.

856
00:36:35,628 --> 00:36:36,460
Ah.

857
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:37,726
This got me in.

858
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:38,807
Unfortunately, miss Estey

859
00:36:38,842 --> 00:36:41,232
with the well-timed help of a Paul Kuffner

860
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:42,967
refused your dinner invitation.

861
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:45,135
You don't look very alert.

862
00:36:47,054 --> 00:36:49,203
Sit down, Archie.

863
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,642
Remove the silly cap.

864
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:56,636
So, I must inform you of the situation

865
00:36:56,671 --> 00:36:58,981
in all of its intricacy.

866
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:01,150
The police will tell me nothing.

867
00:37:01,185 --> 00:37:04,655
With all of their advantages of manpower and authority...

868
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,365
they will certainly forestall us.

869
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,218
But I intend to persuade myself that I am justified

870
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:13,159
in keeping Mrs. Fromm's fee.

871
00:37:13,194 --> 00:37:15,065
Besides, I resent the assumption

872
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,765
that those who come to seek my help

873
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,271
may be murdered with impunity... that's the personal reason.

874
00:37:21,068 --> 00:37:22,442
We'll get the bastard.

875
00:37:22,477 --> 00:37:25,153
I doubt it, Fred.

876
00:37:25,188 --> 00:37:27,795
But we will try.

877
00:37:27,830 --> 00:37:31,054
There are dozens of possible approaches to the problem.

878
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,992
So Saul, tell me, where do you want to start?

879
00:37:35,027 --> 00:37:37,187
I'd kind of like to start with that A.E.R. place...

880
00:37:37,621 --> 00:37:38,489
that refugee joint?

881
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,224
Mrs. Fromm's organization.

882
00:37:40,259 --> 00:37:41,490
Why?

883
00:37:41,525 --> 00:37:43,089
Because they're interested in refugees

884
00:37:43,124 --> 00:37:44,517
and Birch used to be

885
00:37:44,552 --> 00:37:46,877
with the immigration and naturalization service.

886
00:37:46,912 --> 00:37:50,372
That's the one connection I see between Birch and Mrs. Fromm.

887
00:37:50,407 --> 00:37:51,412
Very well.

888
00:37:51,447 --> 00:37:53,942
Take $200 in expenses.

889
00:37:53,977 --> 00:37:56,273
But a displaced person would not be lavish.

890
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:58,841
Yeah, I know that.

891
00:37:58,876 --> 00:38:00,866
I'll start with the spider earrings...

892
00:38:00,901 --> 00:38:01,912
not that I've seen any.

893
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,213
How big were they?

894
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:04,515
Archie?

895
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,666
Like so, like so.

896
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,384
Were they gold?

897
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,924
I think they were gold, but don't quote me.

898
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:16,361
Archie, give Orrie... $100.

899
00:38:20,439 --> 00:38:21,586
What about you, Fred?

900
00:38:21,621 --> 00:38:22,733
Where do you start?

901
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,034
Them earrings.

902
00:38:27,947 --> 00:38:29,023
No. They're- They're covered.

903
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:32,293
Has anyone a suggestion for Fred?

904
00:38:33,453 --> 00:38:34,878
We'll think of something.

905
00:38:36,416 --> 00:38:37,424
Let's try this:

906
00:38:37,459 --> 00:38:41,580
I assume that on Tuesday afternoon

907
00:38:41,615 --> 00:38:44,551
when the woman driver stopped at the corner

908
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:46,329
and told the boy Pete to get a cop

909
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:49,193
that the man in the car with her was Matthew Birch.

910
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,248
What? I don't get that, Mr. Wolfe.

911
00:38:52,283 --> 00:38:54,406
Good. Then it probably hasn't occurred to the police.

912
00:38:54,441 --> 00:38:57,099
Now, I admit that this is extremely tenuous

913
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:59,592
but later that night, the same car

914
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:02,016
ran over and killed Matthew Birch

915
00:39:02,051 --> 00:39:04,768
in a place and manner indicating that it had

916
00:39:04,803 --> 00:39:06,865
carried him to the spot.

917
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:10,842
Therefore, since Birch was in the car late in the evening

918
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:14,785
why not assume that he was in the car early in the evening?

919
00:39:15,219 --> 00:39:16,485
The assumption would be

920
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,836
that the man that ran the car over the boy on Wednesday

921
00:39:18,871 --> 00:39:19,912
was the same guy who was in the car

922
00:39:19,947 --> 00:39:21,261
with the woman on Tuesday.

923
00:39:21,296 --> 00:39:23,260
Because wherever he was, he knew the boy

924
00:39:23,295 --> 00:39:23,996
could identify him.

925
00:39:24,031 --> 00:39:25,193
It couldn't have been Birch

926
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:27,701
'cause by Wednesday, Birch was... dead.

927
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,268
That's probably what the police assume.

928
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:34,269
It... sounds logical.

929
00:39:35,018 --> 00:39:37,589
Fred, you will proceed on my assumption

930
00:39:37,624 --> 00:39:40,160
that Birch was in the car with the woman.

931
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:43,499
Try either to validate it or disprove it.

932
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:44,670
Archie will supply you

933
00:39:44,705 --> 00:39:46,176
with a photograph of Birch.

934
00:39:46,211 --> 00:39:47,751
Archie, could you get photographs

935
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,486
of everyone involved?

936
00:39:49,521 --> 00:39:50,354
Tomorrow.

937
00:39:50,788 --> 00:39:51,655
Do so.

938
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:53,824
And then there's something I want you to do.

939
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:55,090
Thank you, gentlemen.

940
00:39:56,213 --> 00:39:59,463
Archie will coordinate your efforts.

941
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:05,958
'Morning.

942
00:40:11,058 --> 00:40:13,343
Have you any questions about the instructions

943
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:14,645
I gave you last night?

944
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:15,911
One.

945
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:18,448
It's clear enough as far as it goes

946
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:19,587
but who am I after?

947
00:40:19,622 --> 00:40:21,550
You're stirring them up.

948
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,408
Turning a tiger loose in a crowd

949
00:40:25,443 --> 00:40:28,672
or, if that's too bombastic, a mouse.

950
00:40:28,707 --> 00:40:30,134
How will they take it?

951
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:31,561
Will they tell the police?

952
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:33,512
If so, which one or ones?

953
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:38,502
Sure. I see the possibilities.

954
00:40:38,537 --> 00:40:40,237
Is there a specific item

955
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:41,445
I should retrieve?

956
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,840
No, none.

957
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:46,709
What?

958
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,912
You've been eating corned beef.

959
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,046
Yes, I have. Yes, I have.

960
00:40:51,081 --> 00:40:54,118
I've been eating corned beef...

961
00:40:54,153 --> 00:40:56,641
But not in premises.

962
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:07,130
Well, well, no costume today.

963
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,514
"Representing Nero Wolfe. "

964
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:12,609
Yes, but not exactly.

965
00:41:12,644 --> 00:41:13,968
Oh?

966
00:41:14,003 --> 00:41:15,746
I'm here on my own.

967
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:16,573
On your own.

968
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:18,191
But don't you work for Nero Wolfe?

969
00:41:18,226 --> 00:41:20,612
I like to get work for me, too

970
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,113
when I get a chance.

971
00:41:22,148 --> 00:41:23,579
Read the other side.

972
00:41:23,614 --> 00:41:26,417
"To discuss what Mrs. Fromm told Mr. Wolfe. "

973
00:41:26,452 --> 00:41:28,432
Yes, that's exactly what

974
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:31,925
I want to talk with you about, but...

975
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,544
just between you and me.

976
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:37,456
I don't understand.

977
00:41:37,491 --> 00:41:38,299
Oh, you soon will.

978
00:41:38,334 --> 00:41:41,028
You see, I was present during the talk

979
00:41:41,063 --> 00:41:43,723
that Mrs. Fromm had with Mr. Wolfe.

980
00:41:43,758 --> 00:41:44,677
I remember all of it.

981
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:45,711
I have a very good memory.

982
00:41:45,746 --> 00:41:47,599
I could recite it to you word for word

983
00:41:47,634 --> 00:41:49,512
or mighty close to it.

984
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:50,038
Well?

985
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:54,011
I think you'd appreciate hearing what that talk was.

986
00:41:54,046 --> 00:41:55,380
I've reason to believe

987
00:41:55,415 --> 00:41:57,231
that you would find it most interesting

988
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:01,260
if I woud recite it to you word for word for $5,000.

989
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,332
Now, I don't expect you

990
00:42:06,367 --> 00:42:08,055
to have that kind of money right now.

991
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,709
You can pay me this afternoon

992
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:11,328
but I must be paid in advance.

993
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:13,604
This is incredible.

994
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,197
Why on earth should I pay you five cents

995
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:18,713
to hear about that talk, let alone $5,000. Why?

996
00:42:18,748 --> 00:42:21,940
Well, that would be telling, wouldn't it?

997
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:24,635
After you pay, and I deliver

998
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:28,245
you may or may not decide whether you got your mony is worth.

999
00:42:31,432 --> 00:42:33,884
And what if I told Mr. Wolfe about your offer?

1000
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:37,154
I'd say you were a liar.

1001
00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:40,389
You trust me. I'd simply say

1002
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:45,561
you were a dirty liar.

1003
00:42:46,945 --> 00:42:50,708
Well, I suppose I should be insulted

1004
00:42:50,743 --> 00:42:53,591
and indignant, but I'm too shocked.

1005
00:42:53,626 --> 00:42:56,440
I didn't know you were a common skunk.

1006
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,345
You should go.

1007
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:06,850
Yes, well, think about the offer.

1008
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:07,718
Taxi!

1009
00:43:08,151 --> 00:43:11,733
Looking for a Mrs. Horan.

1010
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,432
Thank you, sir.

1011
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:14,627
Just across the street.

1012
00:43:17,286 --> 00:43:18,622
Ah, Mrs. Horan.

1013
00:43:18,657 --> 00:43:21,296
Do I know you? Do we know each other?

1014
00:43:21,331 --> 00:43:22,787
Quiet, darling.

1015
00:43:22,822 --> 00:43:26,803
Not exactly, but we're about to meet.

1016
00:43:27,148 --> 00:43:29,664
Oh, a detective, working with Nero Wolfe.

1017
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:30,888
For Nero Wolfe.

1018
00:43:30,923 --> 00:43:31,747
Have you heard of him?

1019
00:43:31,782 --> 00:43:34,177
Oh, yes, my husband saw him the other day.

1020
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,930
What day was it? I'm not sure.

1021
00:43:35,965 --> 00:43:37,013
If you're looking for him...

1022
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:40,389
No, Mrs. Horan, actually. Turn the card over.

1023
00:43:40,795 --> 00:43:42,419
"To discuss what Mrs. Fromm... "

1024
00:43:43,720 --> 00:43:45,455
With me? Why would I be interested?

1025
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,381
Mrs. Fromm visited Mr. Wolfe and...

1026
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:49,163
Poor Mrs. Fromm.

1027
00:43:49,198 --> 00:43:50,475
...I was present out their conversation.

1028
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:51,752
She tried to help all those people...

1029
00:43:51,787 --> 00:43:53,361
Their entire conversation...

1030
00:43:53,396 --> 00:43:55,541
You see, I heard everything that was said.

1031
00:43:55,576 --> 00:43:57,438
And to satisfy your curiosity

1032
00:43:57,473 --> 00:43:59,301
I will tell you for $5,000.

1033
00:43:59,336 --> 00:44:01,505
And I will pay it back the day it rains up

1034
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,607
instead of down.

1035
00:44:02,642 --> 00:44:03,639
How about that?

1036
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:05,073
What an amusing idea.

1037
00:44:05,108 --> 00:44:06,594
Yes, yes, yes.

1038
00:44:06,629 --> 00:44:08,207
"Raining up instead of down. "

1039
00:44:08,242 --> 00:44:09,306
Yes.

1040
00:44:09,341 --> 00:44:10,957
Would it be raining from the clouds up

1041
00:44:10,992 --> 00:44:12,574
or up from the grounds to the clouds?

1042
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:13,356
Well either actually.

1043
00:44:13,391 --> 00:44:15,819
I think I like it better raining up from the ground.

1044
00:44:16,253 --> 00:44:19,072
Oh, well, we're about the rain are we, Mrs. Horan?

1045
00:44:19,107 --> 00:44:21,892
you see, I'm willing to sell you some information

1046
00:44:21,893 --> 00:44:24,340
about what Mrs Fromm might have said to Mr. Wolfe.

1047
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:27,097
But why would that interest me?

1048
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:28,363
Oh, I see.

1049
00:44:28,398 --> 00:44:31,868
You mean, she told him something awful about me.

1050
00:44:32,302 --> 00:44:35,555
That doesn't surprise me any. What was it?

1051
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,809
Well, I'm not sure you understand exactly

1052
00:44:38,844 --> 00:44:40,509
what I'm talking about here.

1053
00:44:40,544 --> 00:44:43,146
Maybe I need to make myself perfectly clear.

1054
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,786
First you give me the money

1055
00:44:45,821 --> 00:44:48,392
then I give you the facts, see?

1056
00:44:49,358 --> 00:44:50,903
You know what I think, Mr. Goodwin?

1057
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:51,708
No, I do not.

1058
00:44:51,743 --> 00:44:53,335
I think you're much too fine a person

1059
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:55,303
to use these kind of tactics

1060
00:44:55,338 --> 00:44:57,202
to stir up my curiosity.

1061
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,812
Well, if it's the money, we could...

1062
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:01,798
I thought you were a nice man.

1063
00:45:01,833 --> 00:45:03,334
You have kind eyes.

1064
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:04,800
Did you know that?

1065
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:07,437
I thought you were a nice man, but I can see i was wrong.

1066
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:09,137
Ya-Wa, attack!

1067
00:45:09,172 --> 00:45:10,005
That's not necessary.

1068
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,109
Oh! No, no, bad dog! Bad, bad!

1069
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,113
Hey! Just have him stop.

1070
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:21,831
<i>Well, it's dangerous out in the front lines</i>

1071
00:45:21,866 --> 00:45:22,891
<i>but I still wasn't ready to give up</i>

1072
00:45:22,926 --> 00:45:26,054
<i>on my quest for $5,000.</i>

1073
00:45:26,344 --> 00:45:29,126
This is the association for european refugees?

1074
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:30,227
Yes, it is.

1075
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:31,454
Just like sign says.

1076
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:33,489
I'm here to see Angela Wright.

1077
00:45:33,524 --> 00:45:34,296
She's busy.

1078
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:36,059
Well, show her this card.

1079
00:45:36,094 --> 00:45:36,795
She's busy.

1080
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:37,801
Show her the card.

1081
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,102
She'll see me.

1082
00:45:55,282 --> 00:45:56,396
Mrs. Wright will see you.

1083
00:45:56,431 --> 00:45:57,526
Corner office.

1084
00:45:57,561 --> 00:45:58,587
I told you so.

1085
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:00,322
You're next, Mr. Heim.

1086
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,526
Yes, ma'am. Thank you very much.

1087
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:05,779
Come in.

1088
00:46:06,569 --> 00:46:07,262
Afternoon.

1089
00:46:07,883 --> 00:46:10,727
You represent Mr. Nero Wolfe.

1090
00:46:11,159 --> 00:46:12,914
I suppose you are a detective also.

1091
00:46:12,949 --> 00:46:13,769
Well, actually...

1092
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:15,504
Are you trying to solve her murder?

1093
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,619
Well, actually, what I'd like to do is...

1094
00:46:17,654 --> 00:46:19,699
I can't see why would anyone wish her dead?

1095
00:46:19,734 --> 00:46:21,576
No matter how she could be.

1096
00:46:21,611 --> 00:46:23,346
She was doing such humanitarian work.

1097
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:25,047
She certainly was.

1098
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,225
You know, the A.E.R. is

1099
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,924
a private organization supported by wonderful people

1100
00:46:28,959 --> 00:46:31,588
like Mrs. Fromm which helps immigrants to find jobs

1101
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:33,942
and provides legal and financial assistance.

1102
00:46:33,977 --> 00:46:35,023
Yes, that's very touching.

1103
00:46:35,058 --> 00:46:36,793
If it were not for Mrs. Fromm, I might

1104
00:46:36,828 --> 00:46:38,528
never have been able to come here.

1105
00:46:39,830 --> 00:46:42,823
What a tragedy her death is.

1106
00:46:42,858 --> 00:46:45,694
Terrible, terrible tragedy, huh?

1107
00:46:45,729 --> 00:46:47,316
So, how can I help you?

1108
00:46:47,351 --> 00:46:48,904
Ah, well, are you aware

1109
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:51,107
that Mrs. Fromm visited Mr. Wolfe

1110
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,771
the day she was killed, murdered?

1111
00:46:53,806 --> 00:46:55,603
No, I didn't know that.

1112
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:56,119
Yes.

1113
00:46:56,154 --> 00:46:58,915
But we were not so close that she confided in me.

1114
00:46:58,950 --> 00:47:00,182
I see, I see.

1115
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,583
So, then you wouldn't be interested in anything

1116
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:03,253
Mrs. Fromm had to say to Mr. Wolfe?

1117
00:47:04,357 --> 00:47:05,821
About me?

1118
00:47:05,856 --> 00:47:08,234
For $5,000, I'll tell you

1119
00:47:08,269 --> 00:47:11,267
exactly what the conversation was in detail.

1120
00:47:11,302 --> 00:47:13,663
So, it does concern me.

1121
00:47:15,398 --> 00:47:18,760
Sit down, Mr. Goodwin.

1122
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:24,012
Perhaps we can arrange something.

1123
00:47:24,569 --> 00:47:25,340
I'm sure we can.

1124
00:47:26,786 --> 00:47:29,713
Shall we put your offer in writing?

1125
00:47:29,748 --> 00:47:31,448
You take me for a sap?

1126
00:47:31,483 --> 00:47:32,983
A "sap"?

1127
00:47:33,728 --> 00:47:34,923
For a fool.

1128
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:36,618
Oh, if you were a fool...

1129
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:40,991
no, if you were so dishonest, wouldn't Mr. Wolfe...?

1130
00:47:41,026 --> 00:47:44,027
I mean, he is a detective, you agree?

1131
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,535
You see, the thing is

1132
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:51,514
I, uh, I've fallen on hard times recently

1133
00:47:51,549 --> 00:47:54,224
and I've never done this before.

1134
00:47:54,259 --> 00:47:58,341
I, uh, my mother, cancer.

1135
00:47:58,376 --> 00:48:00,245
Ridiculous.

1136
00:48:01,164 --> 00:48:02,657
What?

1137
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:03,945
Ridiculous.

1138
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,385
What is ridiculous?

1139
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:08,650
Mr. Goodwin, I resent being taken

1140
00:48:08,685 --> 00:48:10,784
for a sap. Is it sap?

1141
00:48:11,354 --> 00:48:14,233
That's my vanity.

1142
00:48:14,381 --> 00:48:17,392
Tell Nero Wolfe

1143
00:48:17,427 --> 00:48:19,596
tell him I mind being underrated by him

1144
00:48:19,631 --> 00:48:21,764
and tell him I think he is a sap

1145
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:25,001
for thinking he can fool me with such a crude trick.

1146
00:48:25,036 --> 00:48:27,288
But miss Wright...

1147
00:48:27,323 --> 00:48:29,540
Yes, Mr. Goodwin?

1148
00:48:31,628 --> 00:48:34,320
Good luck to all of you.

1149
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,115
<i>After Angela Wright, I had one more offer to make</i>

1150
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,518
<i>Paul Kaffner, but I called Wolfe to report.</i>

1151
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:43,852
Archie, come home at once.

1152
00:48:43,887 --> 00:48:47,791
Mr. Kuffner is here and I want to see you.

1153
00:48:52,128 --> 00:48:53,863
Oh!

1154
00:48:59,502 --> 00:49:00,769
Don't sit there, Archie.

1155
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:05,220
Your right to sit at that desk is suspended.

1156
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:09,444
Move, please. Move.

1157
00:49:10,486 --> 00:49:13,022
Mr. Kuffner has a shocking accusation.

1158
00:49:13,817 --> 00:49:15,550
Sit there.

1159
00:49:17,701 --> 00:49:19,286
Mr. Kuffner?

1160
00:49:20,928 --> 00:49:22,709
A woman I trust says that you offered to tell her

1161
00:49:22,744 --> 00:49:25,095
about the conversation Mrs. Fromm had with Mr. Wolfe

1162
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:28,022
if she would first pay you $5,000 in cash.

1163
00:49:28,057 --> 00:49:29,432
What's the woman name?

1164
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:31,132
I have not told Mr. Wolfe

1165
00:49:31,167 --> 00:49:33,117
because one was requested not to.

1166
00:49:33,152 --> 00:49:34,438
Of course, you know it.

1167
00:49:34,473 --> 00:49:35,505
I've forgotten. Tell me.

1168
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,401
No.

1169
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:38,171
For God's sakes, if you were a U.S. senator

1170
00:49:38,206 --> 00:49:40,976
I wouldn't expect you to name the accuser

1171
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:43,747
but since you're not, go climb a tree.

1172
00:49:43,782 --> 00:49:45,880
He has a point, Mr. Kuffner.

1173
00:49:45,915 --> 00:49:48,952
Anonymous accusations are in questionable taste.

1174
00:49:48,987 --> 00:49:50,704
You should name her.

1175
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,231
I was asked not to.

1176
00:49:52,266 --> 00:49:55,546
Then I'm afraid we're at an impasse.

1177
00:49:56,732 --> 00:49:58,061
May I smoke?

1178
00:49:58,096 --> 00:49:58,928
No.

1179
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:05,869
It was Angela Wright.

1180
00:50:07,106 --> 00:50:08,870
Archie?

1181
00:50:08,905 --> 00:50:12,537
Did you make Angela Wright such as proposal

1182
00:50:12,572 --> 00:50:14,879
as described by Mr. Kuffner?

1183
00:50:14,914 --> 00:50:15,810
No, sir.

1184
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:17,428
Did you say anything to her

1185
00:50:17,463 --> 00:50:20,617
that could have reasonably been construed as such a proposal?

1186
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:21,449
No, sir.

1187
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,954
Then you may sit at your desk.

1188
00:50:28,628 --> 00:50:31,317
Mr. Kuffner, I'm afraid we're at a dead end.

1189
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:33,387
If it is an issue of voracity

1190
00:50:33,422 --> 00:50:36,184
between Mr. Goodwin and Mrs. Wright

1191
00:50:36,219 --> 00:50:38,090
I believe Mr. Goodwin.

1192
00:50:40,844 --> 00:50:40,844
Yes, you would. Of course.

1193
00:50:40,879 --> 00:50:43,017
And even if I could prove such an offer was made

1194
00:50:43,052 --> 00:50:45,086
where would it get me?

1195
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:46,584
Look, Wolfe, we haven't much time.

1196
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,048
I must get to Mrs. Fromm's funeral

1197
00:50:48,083 --> 00:50:48,731
but you should know

1198
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:49,873
that my professional function

1199
00:50:49,908 --> 00:50:50,980
was to give advice to my clients.

1200
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:52,298
Mrs. Fromm and the association

1201
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,412
relied on me to handle their affairs

1202
00:50:54,447 --> 00:50:57,317
so that their activities would be regarded in a favorable light.

1203
00:50:57,352 --> 00:50:58,898
I will do anything in my power to see

1204
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:02,562
that Mrs. Fromm's reputation is not damaged, and, while I see

1205
00:51:02,597 --> 00:51:04,826
no connection between the association's affairs

1206
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:07,897
and her death, I believe it is possible, indeed probable

1207
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:09,164
that there is a connection

1208
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:11,367
between Mrs. Fromm's death and a talk with you.

1209
00:51:11,402 --> 00:51:13,948
Now, if I am to further my client's interests

1210
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:15,922
I need to know about that conversation.

1211
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:17,322
I've tried to talk to the police about it

1212
00:51:17,357 --> 00:51:18,872
but they won't tell me, so you must.

1213
00:51:18,907 --> 00:51:20,875
I'll pay you $5,000 for it.

1214
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:23,947
Which is it, Mr. Kuffner, black or white?

1215
00:51:23,982 --> 00:51:25,213
Five minutes ago

1216
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,983
you were going to report

1217
00:51:27,018 --> 00:51:28,279
an iniquitous proposal.

1218
00:51:28,314 --> 00:51:30,887
Now you're ready to be a party to it.

1219
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,056
An extraordinary ethical somersault.

1220
00:51:33,091 --> 00:51:35,582
I have the cash with me.

1221
00:51:36,287 --> 00:51:38,110
No, Mr. Kuffner.

1222
00:51:38,145 --> 00:51:39,920
I'm afraid to deal with you.

1223
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:41,696
You're too agile for me.

1224
00:51:41,731 --> 00:51:42,997
You can't deny me. You can't.

1225
00:51:43,032 --> 00:51:44,652
As a representative of Mrs. Fromm's interests

1226
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,512
I have the right to demand it.

1227
00:51:46,936 --> 00:51:48,671
You'll be late for the funeral.

1228
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,404
<i>Orry used hi connections in the jewelry trade to locate</i>

1229
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:10,087
<i>a store on 46th street where the golden spider earrings</i>

1230
00:52:10,122 --> 00:52:11,626
<i>had been displayed in the window.</i>

1231
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:15,565
<i>When Orrie asked about them, the proprietor clammed up.</i>

1232
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:19,035
<i>Now it was up to me to open that clam somehow.</i>

1233
00:52:26,164 --> 00:52:26,843
Who is it, Irving?

1234
00:52:26,878 --> 00:52:28,144
I don't know, papa.

1235
00:52:29,091 --> 00:52:30,174
Oh, it's you again.

1236
00:52:31,964 --> 00:52:32,639
Who are you?

1237
00:52:32,674 --> 00:52:33,314
Archie Goodwin.

1238
00:52:33,349 --> 00:52:35,084
We work for Nero Wolfe.

1239
00:52:35,633 --> 00:52:36,664
The detective?

1240
00:52:36,699 --> 00:52:37,660
That's right.

1241
00:52:37,695 --> 00:52:38,398
I want to ask you something

1242
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:40,489
about the murder of, uh, Pete Drossos.

1243
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:41,525
Who's that? A gangster?

1244
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,039
I know nothing about gangsters.

1245
00:52:43,074 --> 00:52:44,518
Oh, no. He was a 12-year-old boy

1246
00:52:44,553 --> 00:52:46,934
just like your son here.

1247
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:48,062
Irving, go.

1248
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:49,833
Do your homework.

1249
00:52:49,868 --> 00:52:51,568
Now.

1250
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:54,569
A boy murdered?

1251
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:56,339
Why didn't you say so.

1252
00:52:56,374 --> 00:52:57,856
Come. Explain.

1253
00:53:03,279 --> 00:53:05,882
I still don't understand why this boy was killed.

1254
00:53:05,917 --> 00:53:07,183
And by the same car.

1255
00:53:09,616 --> 00:53:10,773
So you want what?

1256
00:53:10,808 --> 00:53:12,743
I want to know who bought those earrings.

1257
00:53:12,778 --> 00:53:13,867
Those spiders?

1258
00:53:13,902 --> 00:53:14,956
That's right.

1259
00:53:15,774 --> 00:53:17,059
One of a kind.

1260
00:53:17,094 --> 00:53:18,336
I gave her a good price.

1261
00:53:18,371 --> 00:53:19,578
Yeah? How'd she pay?

1262
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:20,339
By check.

1263
00:53:20,374 --> 00:53:22,799
By check? What was the signature?

1264
00:53:22,834 --> 00:53:23,666
The name?

1265
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:27,950
It was the woman who was murdered... Laura Fromm.

1266
00:53:27,951 --> 00:53:30,103
Ah, Laura Fromm.

1267
00:53:30,138 --> 00:53:31,681
You've been most helpful.

1268
00:53:31,716 --> 00:53:32,774
Thank you.

1269
00:53:36,494 --> 00:53:38,267
We're back. We tracked down the earrings.

1270
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:39,716
Guess who bought them.

1271
00:53:39,751 --> 00:53:41,145
Mrs. Damon Fromm.

1272
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:42,656
You knew?

1273
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:44,487
No, Orrie. I was asked to guess.

1274
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:45,320
Now I know.

1275
00:53:45,355 --> 00:53:47,307
Good work, Orrie.

1276
00:53:47,342 --> 00:53:50,068
Saul phoned. He started something

1277
00:53:50,103 --> 00:53:51,144
but he's not sure what.

1278
00:53:51,179 --> 00:53:51,826
Yes, I know.

1279
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:53,813
I saw him at the association office.

1280
00:53:53,848 --> 00:53:56,271
Yes. He calls himself Leopold Heim.

1281
00:53:56,306 --> 00:53:59,669
Under that name he has taken a cheap hotel on first avenue.

1282
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:02,072
After you left the association office

1283
00:54:02,107 --> 00:54:04,440
he had a brief talk with Angela Wright.

1284
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,447
Who referred you to our organization?

1285
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:09,484
Uh, special agent for immigration and naturalization.

1286
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:12,248
It was, uh, Birch. Mr. Matthew Birch.

1287
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:13,081
Oh, really?

1288
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,068
Mr. Birch is dead.

1289
00:54:15,103 --> 00:54:17,712
Dead? Oh, I'm sorry.

1290
00:54:17,747 --> 00:54:18,450
I didn't know.

1291
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:19,153
A few weeks ago

1292
00:54:19,188 --> 00:54:21,357
he told me to come here, so here I am.

1293
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,526
You entered the country illegal?

1294
00:54:23,561 --> 00:54:25,261
Well, yes and no.

1295
00:54:25,296 --> 00:54:26,961
Yes.

1296
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:28,696
I was told this association

1297
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:31,168
would be able to help people like me.

1298
00:54:32,153 --> 00:54:34,370
The association cannot be an accessory

1299
00:54:34,405 --> 00:54:36,539
to a violation of the law.

1300
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:38,900
No, no, I understand.

1301
00:54:39,601 --> 00:54:40,419
No.

1302
00:54:40,454 --> 00:54:41,311
Of course not.

1303
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,214
I don't know...

1304
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,348
what I should do.

1305
00:54:47,383 --> 00:54:48,636
Consult with a lawyer.

1306
00:54:48,671 --> 00:54:49,951
A lawyer?

1307
00:54:49,986 --> 00:54:51,721
I don't know any lawyers.

1308
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,492
Here is a lawyer you can trust.

1309
00:54:56,663 --> 00:54:58,227
Denis Horan.

1310
00:54:58,262 --> 00:54:59,494
I have no money.

1311
00:54:59,529 --> 00:55:02,566
He works for the association.

1312
00:55:02,601 --> 00:55:03,866
It's a service.

1313
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,903
Oh, a service.

1314
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,722
That's very kind.

1315
00:55:09,757 --> 00:55:10,807
Thank you very much.

1316
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,976
I appreciate it. I appreciate it.

1317
00:55:13,011 --> 00:55:13,843
Thank you.

1318
00:55:15,354 --> 00:55:19,265
Saul went to Ran's office and told him of his plight.

1319
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,861
Mr. Heim, you have a very big problem.

1320
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:26,611
Many people like you come to me every day

1321
00:55:26,646 --> 00:55:30,326
but I'm only able to help a very few.

1322
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:33,478
However...

1323
00:55:33,513 --> 00:55:37,266
there may be a solution to this mess.

1324
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,002
Where can you be found?

1325
00:55:39,890 --> 00:55:40,268
Hotel.

1326
00:55:40,303 --> 00:55:44,237
The hotel Duval in room 312.

1327
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:48,172
Go to your room and wait.

1328
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:49,341
Tonight.

1329
00:55:50,102 --> 00:55:50,102
I wait?

1330
00:55:50,137 --> 00:55:51,075
This evening.

1331
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,014
This evening.

1332
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:52,882
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1333
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,786
I really appreciate it very much.

1334
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:57,619
Thank you.

1335
00:55:58,506 --> 00:56:00,690
So Saul went back to the hotel.

1336
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:02,477
At 8:00 p. m.

1337
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:04,230
he had a caller.

1338
00:56:06,763 --> 00:56:08,931
Uh, just a second, please.

1339
00:56:08,966 --> 00:56:10,198
Just one minute.

1340
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,402
Please. Yes, uh, come in.

1341
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:14,137
Please come in. The door is open.

1342
00:56:15,618 --> 00:56:16,887
You Heim?

1343
00:56:16,922 --> 00:56:18,156
Who are you?

1344
00:56:20,823 --> 00:56:21,783
I'm here to help you.

1345
00:56:21,818 --> 00:56:22,709
What do you mean?

1346
00:56:22,744 --> 00:56:24,547
How... how are you going to help me?

1347
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:29,318
I'm aware of your predicament

1348
00:56:29,353 --> 00:56:30,637
and I sympathize.

1349
00:56:30,672 --> 00:56:31,886
But don't worry.

1350
00:56:31,921 --> 00:56:33,656
You want help, don't you?

1351
00:56:33,691 --> 00:56:34,758
Yes, I need help.

1352
00:56:34,793 --> 00:56:36,176
Of course I do.

1353
00:56:36,211 --> 00:56:37,560
You're an illegal.

1354
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:40,058
Illegal, really, in a manner of speaking.

1355
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:42,432
That means the FBI and the police

1356
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:43,216
have to be dealt with.

1357
00:56:43,251 --> 00:56:44,465
It's going to be costly.

1358
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:47,537
So you... you wanted how much?

1359
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:49,073
Ten thousand dollars.

1360
00:56:49,108 --> 00:56:50,538
What? $10,000?

1361
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:52,273
No, but for what is the...?

1362
00:56:52,308 --> 00:56:56,212
To prevent any kind of exposure or harassment.

1363
00:56:56,247 --> 00:56:57,964
No, no. You don't understand.

1364
00:56:57,999 --> 00:56:59,491
I have nothing. I have nothing.

1365
00:56:59,526 --> 00:57:00,948
$10,000 is a ridiculous amount...

1366
00:57:00,983 --> 00:57:02,718
You can do it by the month, by the week

1367
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:04,454
a little bit here, a little bit there.

1368
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:08,791
I see, for a little bit from the week and the month.

1369
00:57:09,225 --> 00:57:11,196
Yes, but... I could...

1370
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:14,236
and the papers are then good, yes?

1371
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:15,948
Guaranteed.

1372
00:57:16,449 --> 00:57:17,432
Remember

1373
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:20,454
Any attempt to alter this arrangement

1374
00:57:20,489 --> 00:57:22,738
would be disastrous.

1375
00:57:22,773 --> 00:57:23,556
Sleep on it.

1376
00:57:23,591 --> 00:57:25,274
I'll be back.

1377
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,107
Sure.

1378
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:27,408
Um... sir?

1379
00:57:27,443 --> 00:57:28,710
Sir, I want to thank you.

1380
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:31,781
I appreciate very much your... your helping me.

1381
00:57:51,896 --> 00:57:57,373
And... walk... ease... easy there, young fellow.

1382
00:57:57,408 --> 00:58:00,428
<i>When he left, Saul managed to follow him.</i>

1383
00:58:00,463 --> 00:58:02,804
<i>The man is now at a restaurant</i>

1384
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:05,146
on third avenue and 14th street.

1385
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:08,342
Saul called from across the street at...

1386
00:58:08,377 --> 00:58:11,136
well, it was less than a half hour ago.

1387
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:13,895
I'll take the sedan and drop Orrie off.

1388
00:58:13,896 --> 00:58:15,909
I'll lay back with the car.

1389
00:58:15,944 --> 00:58:16,773
Nero Wolfe's.

1390
00:58:16,808 --> 00:58:18,160
Archie, it's Fred.

1391
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:19,654
Is the boss there? He ought to hear this.

1392
00:58:19,689 --> 00:58:21,182
Hiya, Fred.

1393
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:22,676
It's Fred.

1394
00:58:23,785 --> 00:58:25,198
Take a taxi.

1395
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:26,577
Go to Saul's.

1396
00:58:26,612 --> 00:58:28,357
If tuns out Fred doesn't needs me worse than Saul

1397
00:58:28,392 --> 00:58:29,425
I'll come join you.

1398
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:30,304
Go on, Fred.

1399
00:58:30,339 --> 00:58:31,172
I'm at a phone booth...

1400
00:58:31,207 --> 00:58:32,508
third avenue and 55th street.

1401
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,052
I just found a lot of new stuff about Matthew Birch.

1402
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:37,713
His main hangout was a dump on ninth and 54th

1403
00:58:37,748 --> 00:58:38,980
Danny's bar and grill.

1404
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,641
I've been in and out asking about Birch

1405
00:58:40,676 --> 00:58:42,213
Telling people my name is O'Connor.

1406
00:58:42,248 --> 00:58:43,751
and I've been told that my wife

1407
00:58:43,786 --> 00:58:46,389
was seen with him at a park last Tuesday afternoon

1408
00:58:46,424 --> 00:58:47,655
In a dark gray Cadillac.

1409
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,223
One guy told me there's a guy

1410
00:58:49,258 --> 00:58:50,258
who'll give me the lowdown on Birch.

1411
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:53,328
If I wanted to see him, come back between 9:30 and 10:00.

1412
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:54,792
Go ahead and play it, but wait 'til I get there.

1413
00:58:54,827 --> 00:58:57,331
I'll take the sedan and park across the street.

1414
00:58:57,366 --> 00:58:59,836
I'll wait in the car until I hear you scream

1415
00:58:59,871 --> 00:59:01,102
or they roll your corpse out.

1416
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,335
If you leave with company, I'll tail you.

1417
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,533
Otherwise, walk along 42nd street, keep going

1418
00:59:05,568 --> 00:59:06,741
and I'll wait until you're loose

1419
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,511
and then I'll come get you. You got it?

1420
00:59:08,546 --> 00:59:10,680
Okay. Anything else, Mr. Wolfe?

1421
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:12,415
No. Proceed.

1422
00:59:21,241 --> 00:59:23,224
You know I dislike guns.

1423
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:26,729
So do I, except in situations where I might get knifed

1424
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:29,065
plugged or shoved off a building.

1425
00:59:51,916 --> 00:59:53,351
<i>I laid back and waited.</i>

1426
00:59:53,386 --> 00:59:56,659
<i>I decided to wait half an hour until 10:19</i>

1427
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:59,262
<i>But I didn't have to wait that long.</i>

1428
01:00:41,771 --> 01:00:43,859
<i>The driver didn't spot me tailing him</i>

1429
01:00:43,894 --> 01:00:46,022
<i>But he drove kind of fast, a little too fast</i>

1430
01:00:46,057 --> 01:00:48,922
<i>for a night when the rain was starting to come down harder and harder.</i>

1431
01:01:37,293 --> 01:01:38,993
<i>They were talking.</i>

1432
01:01:39,028 --> 01:01:42,064
<i>I couldn't make out what they were saying, so...</i>

1433
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:46,402
<i>I looked for a better vantage point.</i>

1434
01:01:46,836 --> 01:01:49,005
Get up.

1435
01:02:04,620 --> 01:02:06,789
You ever been to st. Louis, Missouri?

1436
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:08,747
St. Louis? No.

1437
01:02:11,351 --> 01:02:12,862
Me, neither.

1438
01:02:34,116 --> 01:02:36,285
Got alligators there.

1439
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,419
Hello, Mort.

1440
01:02:38,454 --> 01:02:40,264
We been waiting for you.

1441
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:41,022
Is he clean?

1442
01:02:41,057 --> 01:02:44,072
Yeah, but he had an "s" and "w" under his arm.

1443
01:02:44,107 --> 01:02:47,087
What's this about your wife and Matthew Birch?

1444
01:02:47,122 --> 01:02:48,864
Someone said they saw her with him.

1445
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,166
I think she's cheating on me.

1446
01:02:50,201 --> 01:02:51,484
You know Matt Birch?

1447
01:02:51,519 --> 01:02:52,733
Me? Birch?

1448
01:02:52,768 --> 01:02:54,503
No, but she must've known him.

1449
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:56,238
I guess so.

1450
01:02:57,932 --> 01:02:59,254
Check his papers.

1451
01:02:59,289 --> 01:03:00,576
All right, boss.

1452
01:03:03,612 --> 01:03:05,347
My name's not "O'Connor. "

1453
01:03:05,781 --> 01:03:07,048
No, it's "Durkin. "

1454
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:08,817
See, the reason I was...

1455
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:09,685
Shut up.

1456
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:10,518
Archie...

1457
01:03:10,553 --> 01:03:12,505
Private dick, eh?

1458
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:14,457
Who you working for?

1459
01:03:14,492 --> 01:03:15,197
Myself.

1460
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:17,003
Even a private dick has a personal life

1461
01:03:17,038 --> 01:03:18,360
and my wife...

1462
01:03:18,794 --> 01:03:20,529
Shut up!

1463
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:21,796
Archie

1464
01:03:22,645 --> 01:03:23,566
The big, white guy...

1465
01:03:23,601 --> 01:03:25,101
he's "lips".

1466
01:03:25,136 --> 01:03:26,602
I followed him

1467
01:03:27,036 --> 01:03:27,903
from the hotel.

1468
01:03:27,938 --> 01:03:29,222
Where's Orrie?

1469
01:03:29,966 --> 01:03:30,471
Orrie's upstairs.

1470
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,206
He's watching our back.

1471
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,844
What do you got for me here, mort?

1472
01:03:40,916 --> 01:03:43,085
Oh, yeah.

1473
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:47,857
Let's get serious, now, huh?

1474
01:03:47,892 --> 01:03:49,592
I want to hear you talk.

1475
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,628
All right.

1476
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:13,883
Get up.

1477
01:04:14,999 --> 01:04:15,818
Come on.

1478
01:04:22,713 --> 01:04:23,592
Back up.

1479
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:26,462
Ah... be nice.

1480
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:28,413
Does it hurt?

1481
01:04:28,448 --> 01:04:29,463
Good, good.

1482
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:31,673
Get some rope, boys. Tie them up.

1483
01:04:31,708 --> 01:04:32,665
<i>In less than a minute</i>

1484
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:36,150
<i>Saul looked through their wallets.</i>

1485
01:04:36,185 --> 01:04:39,475
<i>They were Lips Egan and Mortimer Erwin.</i>

1486
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:42,511
And the last entry is Leopold Heim, me.

1487
01:04:42,546 --> 01:04:45,114
What do you think... little blackmail?

1488
01:04:45,149 --> 01:04:46,380
So, that'sit.

1489
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:50,102
Geez, there must be a thousand names in this book.

1490
01:04:50,137 --> 01:04:53,789
Each one paid ten grand... that's ten million bucks.

1491
01:04:53,824 --> 01:04:55,758
Quite a racket, fellas.

1492
01:04:55,793 --> 01:04:57,693
Do you care to comment?

1493
01:04:58,127 --> 01:04:58,994
Yeah. I ought to explain.

1494
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:00,096
Yeah. I should explain.

1495
01:05:00,131 --> 01:05:01,128
We work for Nero Wolfe

1496
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:02,429
and we disapprove of blackmail

1497
01:05:02,464 --> 01:05:04,165
but that's not what we're working on.

1498
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:07,598
We're working on a murder... or should I say three murders?

1499
01:05:07,633 --> 01:05:09,834
So, if I ask you

1500
01:05:09,869 --> 01:05:13,742
about your racket, it's to get at a murder, see?

1501
01:05:13,777 --> 01:05:15,044
For instance...

1502
01:05:16,784 --> 01:05:19,226
was Matthew Birch in with you on this?

1503
01:05:21,984 --> 01:05:22,851
Ow! Ow!

1504
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:25,671
That's it, you lousy little rat!

1505
01:05:25,706 --> 01:05:28,057
Now that that's out of your system you feel better?

1506
01:05:29,194 --> 01:05:30,226
Another thing, uh...

1507
01:05:30,659 --> 01:05:33,244
how much of, uh, the cut of the dough was yours

1508
01:05:33,279 --> 01:05:34,997
and who got the rest?

1509
01:05:35,032 --> 01:05:36,099
What dough?

1510
01:05:36,134 --> 01:05:37,166
"What dough?"

1511
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:38,546
Huh.

1512
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,809
Who gave you the tip on Leopold Heim?

1513
01:05:41,844 --> 01:05:43,637
Nobody.

1514
01:05:43,672 --> 01:05:44,505
Tough character.

1515
01:05:44,540 --> 01:05:45,806
He's very tough, Archie.

1516
01:05:45,841 --> 01:05:47,576
Let me do a little crisscross on him.

1517
01:05:47,611 --> 01:05:48,409
Yeah, get his arms.

1518
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:50,482
All right. Hey, Fred, move him.

1519
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:52,823
Come on.

1520
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:54,915
Allright. Here we go.

1521
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:56,217
The crisscross?

1522
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:57,518
"The crisscross," yeah.

1523
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,494
I don't know if you've been introduced

1524
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:01,422
It's a scientific method

1525
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:03,192
for stimulating vocal cords.

1526
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:05,250
If and when you decide you don't want any more

1527
01:06:05,285 --> 01:06:06,300
there's a phone right there

1528
01:06:06,335 --> 01:06:07,898
and you can always call police headquarters.

1529
01:06:07,933 --> 01:06:08,964
We'll stop the science here

1530
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:10,075
you can tell them anything you want

1531
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:13,602
without interference or... you can answer my questions.

1532
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,639
Did you see Birch in that car?

1533
01:06:17,940 --> 01:06:20,109
Who gave you the tip on Leopold Heim?

1534
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:29,339
Who's the boss of your racket?

1535
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,574
Birch is... or was.

1536
01:06:32,609 --> 01:06:34,572
Hmm. All right, now, we're getting somewhere.

1537
01:06:34,607 --> 01:06:36,123
Now... did you see Birch in the car

1538
01:06:36,158 --> 01:06:38,679
with a woman last, uh, Tuesday afternoon?

1539
01:06:38,714 --> 01:06:39,194
What woman?

1540
01:06:39,229 --> 01:06:40,027
"What woman?"

1541
01:06:40,062 --> 01:06:41,762
This hurts me more than it hurts you.

1542
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,993
All right, let up, let up.

1543
01:06:44,028 --> 01:06:45,332
I saw them together.

1544
01:06:45,367 --> 01:06:46,863
You saw them together in Birch's car?

1545
01:06:46,898 --> 01:06:47,835
I don't know whose car it was.

1546
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:48,954
Ah, who- who was the woman?

1547
01:06:48,989 --> 01:06:50,004
I don't know her either.

1548
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:51,774
All right, who was driving the car?

1549
01:06:51,809 --> 01:06:53,040
Was Birch driving the car?

1550
01:06:53,075 --> 01:06:55,244
No, no, that's what surprised me... she was.

1551
01:06:55,279 --> 01:06:56,562
Birch wasn't the type of guy

1552
01:06:56,597 --> 01:06:57,846
who let a dame do the driving.

1553
01:06:59,148 --> 01:07:01,749
Who gave you the tip on, uh, Leopold Heim?

1554
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:02,618
I don't know.

1555
01:07:03,485 --> 01:07:04,318
Oh, no!

1556
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:06,522
Come on, I'm telling the truth.

1557
01:07:07,467 --> 01:07:08,656
I got leads in two ways...

1558
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,293
from Birch and from some woman.

1559
01:07:11,727 --> 01:07:12,593
What woman?

1560
01:07:12,594 --> 01:07:13,427
I don't know.

1561
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:15,197
Well, how do you know it wasn't a trap?

1562
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:16,932
She uses a password.

1563
01:07:16,967 --> 01:07:17,765
A password, eh?

1564
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,185
Well, what's the password?

1565
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,263
"Said the spider to the fly".

1566
01:07:22,298 --> 01:07:24,306
"Said the spider to the fly. "

1567
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:26,041
Spider earrings.

1568
01:07:26,076 --> 01:07:27,793
Yeah...

1569
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:29,875
"Spider earrings".

1570
01:07:29,910 --> 01:07:31,470
Very good, Fred.

1571
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:32,995
Very, very good.

1572
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:35,527
And, uh, what number did you call her at?

1573
01:07:35,562 --> 01:07:36,884
Oh, I never called.

1574
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:38,152
No, she called me.

1575
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:39,900
Birch was the contact.

1576
01:07:41,223 --> 01:07:43,379
Are we, uh... are we expecting anyone?

1577
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,418
Well, hello, there.

1578
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:10,285
Ah-Ah-Ah.

1579
01:08:10,719 --> 01:08:12,020
Hello, Orrie. Good to see you.

1580
01:08:12,055 --> 01:08:13,756
Just in time. Thanks.

1581
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:15,456
Come on in.

1582
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:16,757
That hurts.

1583
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:18,058
"That hurts," huh?

1584
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:19,793
Yeah, well, we're very serious here.

1585
01:08:19,828 --> 01:08:22,431
I've got the name of an ambulance, if you'd like.

1586
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:23,697
Yes, it is serious...

1587
01:08:23,732 --> 01:08:26,125
serious enough to finish you, Goodwin.

1588
01:08:27,202 --> 01:08:28,035
Pipe down, pipe down.

1589
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:29,805
I'm going to make a phone call.

1590
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:53,627
Nero Wolfe.

1591
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:55,397
Yeah, I need some advice.

1592
01:08:55,432 --> 01:08:56,230
I'm asleep.

1593
01:08:56,265 --> 01:08:57,097
Well, splash some...

1594
01:08:57,132 --> 01:08:58,741
<i>And, so, I filled him in.</i>

1595
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:01,083
<i>I talked about Mort, talked about Lips...</i>

1596
01:09:01,118 --> 01:09:02,078
<i>told him about the notebook</i>

1597
01:09:02,113 --> 01:09:04,169
<i>with 1,000 names now in my pocket...</i>

1598
01:09:04,204 --> 01:09:06,013
<i>he could draw his own conclusion...</i>

1599
01:09:06,048 --> 01:09:07,787
<i>and I told him about lips' claim</i>

1600
01:09:07,822 --> 01:09:09,681
<i>that Birch was the boss in the racket</i>

1601
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:12,967
<i>although the orders came from a woman he had never seen</i>

1602
01:09:13,002 --> 01:09:16,218
<i>and how Denis Horan showed up in the middle of all this.</i>

1603
01:09:16,253 --> 01:09:20,122
This is... very satisfactory.

1604
01:09:21,857 --> 01:09:24,026
Apologize to Mr. Horan.

1605
01:09:24,061 --> 01:09:26,243
What? Have a heart.

1606
01:09:26,446 --> 01:09:27,461
He's a lawyer.

1607
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:29,665
We won't give him cards to play.

1608
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,896
Keep the notebook.

1609
01:09:33,931 --> 01:09:35,924
Mention it to no one

1610
01:09:35,959 --> 01:09:38,340
And put in the safe as soon as you get home.

1611
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,040
Right, right.

1612
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,155
Although it makes me ill to consider...

1613
01:09:42,190 --> 01:09:44,236
As Wolfe laid out the rest of the plan

1614
01:09:44,271 --> 01:09:45,452
some of it was sketchy

1615
01:09:45,487 --> 01:09:47,883
but, finally, I said I had it and I hung up.

1616
01:09:47,918 --> 01:09:49,618
...those barbarians to my house.

1617
01:09:50,919 --> 01:09:54,823
Boys, you committed two felonies...

1618
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:58,555
assault with a firearm on Fred

1619
01:09:58,590 --> 01:10:00,891
And extortion on Saul.

1620
01:10:00,926 --> 01:10:02,922
Aw, you'll never make it stick.

1621
01:10:02,957 --> 01:10:04,717
No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1622
01:10:04,752 --> 01:10:06,443
Now, my inclination would

1623
01:10:06,478 --> 01:10:07,367
to have the cops come down here

1624
01:10:07,402 --> 01:10:09,137
and take you two birds away, but I work

1625
01:10:09,172 --> 01:10:10,316
for Nero Wolfe, see?

1626
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:11,380
So, he might think differently.

1627
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:12,275
He might want to bring you

1628
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:14,690
to his house for questioning. That's we 're gonna do.

1629
01:10:14,725 --> 01:10:16,546
All right, you have one other choice

1630
01:10:16,547 --> 01:10:17,984
which is to go to the cops.

1631
01:10:18,247 --> 01:10:20,529
Now, I'd be happy to take you down to the station

1632
01:10:20,564 --> 01:10:22,811
But that's your only choice. As for you, Mr. Horan

1633
01:10:22,846 --> 01:10:25,465
I want to tender our sincere apologies.

1634
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,588
Because of these two characters.

1635
01:10:28,589 --> 01:10:32,560
Mr. Wolfe would personally send his regrets as well.

1636
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,650
Yes, and I would like to apologize to you

1637
01:10:34,685 --> 01:10:36,465
for one other thing, actually.

1638
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,116
I neglected to introduce you

1639
01:10:38,151 --> 01:10:39,501
to Mr. Saul Panzer...

1640
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:40,369
Yes.

1641
01:10:40,802 --> 01:10:41,635
Thank you very much

1642
01:10:41,962 --> 01:10:43,683
For all the help you've given me.

1643
01:10:43,718 --> 01:10:45,574
I appreciate very much.

1644
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,504
Otherwise known as Leopold Heim.

1645
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:49,838
That's it.

1646
01:10:50,308 --> 01:10:51,572
All right, now

1647
01:10:51,607 --> 01:10:52,986
Please go out your business.

1648
01:10:53,021 --> 01:10:54,214
But there is, uh...

1649
01:10:54,249 --> 01:10:55,949
I had th this great idea.

1650
01:10:55,984 --> 01:10:58,182
In fairness to, uh, Mr. Egan over here.

1651
01:10:58,217 --> 01:11:00,322
If we go down to Wolfe's house, you might want

1652
01:11:00,357 --> 01:11:02,491
to, uh, be represented by an attorney

1653
01:11:02,526 --> 01:11:04,625
and just by coincidence, guess what?

1654
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,262
There's an attorney in the room... Mr. Denis Horan.

1655
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:09,126
<i>Horan was in a pickle.</i>

1656
01:11:09,161 --> 01:11:10,471
<i>If Horan deserted them</i>

1657
01:11:10,506 --> 01:11:11,746
<i>they might desert him</i>

1658
01:11:11,781 --> 01:11:14,396
<i>But to say yes would tie him to them.</i>

1659
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,106
Isn't it a lawyer's duty to help a guy who's in a jam?

1660
01:11:18,141 --> 01:11:22,657
So, it is, but I'm quite busy right now.

1661
01:11:22,692 --> 01:11:25,263
Yeah, so am I.

1662
01:11:25,851 --> 01:11:28,048
Of course.

1663
01:11:28,083 --> 01:11:30,902
Very well, I'll see what I can do.

1664
01:11:30,937 --> 01:11:33,722
Uh, we'll have to have a talk.

1665
01:11:34,156 --> 01:11:35,457
All right, let's go, boys.

1666
01:11:35,891 --> 01:11:38,927
Hey, bring those pliers for a souvenir, Fred.

1667
01:11:40,958 --> 01:11:42,025
Good morning.

1668
01:11:42,060 --> 01:11:43,092
Good morning.

1669
01:11:46,301 --> 01:11:47,602
All right, take it easy, Fred

1670
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:48,904
Don't kill anybody, all right?

1671
01:11:48,939 --> 01:11:50,170
How did everything go?

1672
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:51,524
Good. I took over from Fred about 5:30.

1673
01:11:51,559 --> 01:11:52,701
Fred, you awake?

1674
01:11:52,736 --> 01:11:53,696
I'm going to get a coffee.

1675
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:54,448
Did you sleep well?

1676
01:11:54,483 --> 01:11:55,711
Oh, thank you.

1677
01:11:55,746 --> 01:11:57,145
This is insufferable!

1678
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:57,919
Well, then don't suffer.

1679
01:11:57,954 --> 01:11:58,623
I told you many times

1680
01:11:58,658 --> 01:11:59,689
you can leave at any time you want.

1681
01:11:59,724 --> 01:12:00,263
How about us?

1682
01:12:00,298 --> 01:12:01,928
For you, deluxe accommodations.

1683
01:12:01,963 --> 01:12:04,186
Your tie is crooked.

1684
01:12:10,592 --> 01:12:11,858
Eight breakfasts.

1685
01:12:11,893 --> 01:12:13,427
Well, that includes three houseguests.

1686
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:15,276
Guests? Here?

1687
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,573
I am on a mission and I am starving.

1688
01:12:18,608 --> 01:12:19,701
Archie, I need $500.

1689
01:12:19,736 --> 01:12:20,527
What for?

1690
01:12:20,562 --> 01:12:21,284
Phone calls.

1691
01:12:21,319 --> 01:12:22,298
Fritz, I'm just going to have that

1692
01:12:22,333 --> 01:12:24,438
'cause that looks great. Mmm.

1693
01:12:24,910 --> 01:12:26,696
<i>I knew it would be useless for me to guess</i>

1694
01:12:26,731 --> 01:12:28,201
<i>what Wolfe had in mind for Orrie</i>

1695
01:12:28,236 --> 01:12:30,979
<i>and I knew it would be useless to ask.</i>

1696
01:12:31,014 --> 01:12:32,356
<i>I also knew Wolfe well enough to know</i>

1697
01:12:32,391 --> 01:12:33,699
<i>he had something up his sleeve.</i>

1698
01:12:33,734 --> 01:12:36,184
<i>He always did.</i>

1699
01:12:38,353 --> 01:12:40,579
<i>That must be inspector Cramer.</i>

1700
01:12:40,614 --> 01:12:42,568
<i>We called him when we got home last night</i>

1701
01:12:42,603 --> 01:12:43,576
<i>And told him everything.</i>

1702
01:12:43,611 --> 01:12:45,393
<i>Well, almost everything.</i>

1703
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:49,596
Yeah?

1704
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:50,687
Yeah, we're on our way somewhere.

1705
01:12:50,722 --> 01:12:51,576
Where are these characters?

1706
01:12:51,611 --> 01:12:52,498
And what do you want to tell me?

1707
01:12:52,533 --> 01:12:54,018
Uh, come in.

1708
01:12:57,421 --> 01:12:59,139
What kept you so long?

1709
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:00,909
Mr. Goodwin phoned more than six hours ago.

1710
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:02,179
As you know my house is full

1711
01:13:02,214 --> 01:13:03,513
of questionable characters

1712
01:13:03,548 --> 01:13:04,813
and I want to get rid of them.

1713
01:13:04,848 --> 01:13:05,422
Where are they?

1714
01:13:05,457 --> 01:13:07,849
Guilty of extortion. And, and... assault

1715
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:09,385
and I'm certain much more.

1716
01:13:09,420 --> 01:13:10,851
Archie will explain later.

1717
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,271
But first, I have two questions.

1718
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,657
Why did the man who killed the boy

1719
01:13:15,692 --> 01:13:16,406
in broad daylight

1720
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:19,528
dare to run the risk of later identification

1721
01:13:19,563 --> 01:13:21,193
by one or more onlookers?

1722
01:13:22,133 --> 01:13:24,949
And the other question concerns the journey of the earrings

1723
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:27,329
bought by Mrs. Fromm

1724
01:13:27,364 --> 01:13:30,370
worn by the woman in the car some days later.

1725
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:34,743
Then worn again by Mrs. Fromm three days after that.

1726
01:13:34,778 --> 01:13:36,478
Can you explain that?

1727
01:13:36,513 --> 01:13:37,351
No.

1728
01:13:37,386 --> 01:13:40,738
So I have provided my own answers.

1729
01:13:40,773 --> 01:13:44,368
But I can't expound upon them without naming my candidate.

1730
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:45,587
If you're ready to name a candidate

1731
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,151
don't let me stop you.

1732
01:13:47,186 --> 01:13:47,756
Have you got one?

1733
01:13:47,791 --> 01:13:48,588
Oh, yes.

1734
01:13:48,623 --> 01:13:50,358
The hell you have.

1735
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:51,625
Name them.

1736
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:53,395
The question was:

1737
01:13:53,430 --> 01:13:54,630
"Have I a candidate?"

1738
01:13:54,665 --> 01:13:57,169
Not "am I ready to nominate?"

1739
01:13:57,204 --> 01:14:01,636
I may be in an hour or week, but not now.

1740
01:14:02,955 --> 01:14:04,635
What is it, Fred?

1741
01:14:04,673 --> 01:14:05,190
Yes, sir.

1742
01:14:05,225 --> 01:14:08,063
Horan wants to speak with you; now. Urgent.

1743
01:14:08,143 --> 01:14:14,000
Mm, this man Horan is a hyena and he irritates me.

1744
01:14:14,035 --> 01:14:15,317
Why don't you talk to him?

1745
01:14:16,555 --> 01:14:17,686
Bring him in.

1746
01:14:21,371 --> 01:14:22,998
Oh, I think I've seen you work

1747
01:14:23,033 --> 01:14:24,626
all the dodges there are, Wolfe

1748
01:14:24,661 --> 01:14:25,981
but this one takes the cake.

1749
01:14:27,738 --> 01:14:29,230
And I don't get it.

1750
01:14:35,036 --> 01:14:36,338
Oh...

1751
01:14:37,639 --> 01:14:38,940
I'm glad you're here.

1752
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,242
So am I.

1753
01:14:41,478 --> 01:14:43,038
I have decided to reveal

1754
01:14:43,073 --> 01:14:45,406
a conversation I had with Mrs. Fromm

1755
01:14:45,441 --> 01:14:46,713
the night of my party.

1756
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,266
I would have revealed it earlier

1757
01:14:48,301 --> 01:14:49,785
except that, as her attorney

1758
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:51,754
I thought it privileged

1759
01:14:51,789 --> 01:14:54,121
but now it seems critical.

1760
01:14:54,122 --> 01:14:55,388
Get to it, Horan.

1761
01:14:56,655 --> 01:14:59,569
She told me that she had received information

1762
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:01,292
that someone in the organization

1763
01:15:01,327 --> 01:15:04,231
was furnishing the names of illegal immigrants

1764
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:07,135
to a blackmailing group led by Matthew Birch

1765
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:10,762
and that a man named Egan was involved.

1766
01:15:10,797 --> 01:15:13,173
She impressed on me especially

1767
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:16,244
the importance of avoiding any scandal

1768
01:15:16,279 --> 01:15:19,281
that might damage the association.

1769
01:15:19,714 --> 01:15:20,981
It was so like her.

1770
01:15:21,016 --> 01:15:24,444
Always thinking of others, never of herself.

1771
01:15:25,481 --> 01:15:26,221
You okay?

1772
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:27,921
Yes.

1773
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:30,547
Aren't you, uh, Egan's attorney?

1774
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:33,595
No... no, that was a mistake.

1775
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:36,860
I acted on impulse.

1776
01:15:36,895 --> 01:15:39,089
I've told him I can't act for him.

1777
01:15:39,124 --> 01:15:41,173
Purley, bring Egan.

1778
01:15:41,208 --> 01:15:43,188
You realize, of course

1779
01:15:43,223 --> 01:15:45,944
that this man is evidently a low criminal

1780
01:15:45,979 --> 01:15:47,716
and he's in a desperate situation.

1781
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,453
He's scarcely a credible witness.

1782
01:15:49,488 --> 01:15:50,444
Yeah.

1783
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:51,344
Come on in.

1784
01:15:51,379 --> 01:15:53,548
Let's take a pew.

1785
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:56,584
Aren't you Lawrence Egan?

1786
01:15:57,091 --> 01:15:59,187
Otherwise known as Lips Egan?

1787
01:15:59,909 --> 01:16:01,482
Yeah. Yeah. That's me.

1788
01:16:01,517 --> 01:16:03,056
And Mr. Horan here

1789
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:06,092
says he doesn't represent you anymore.

1790
01:16:06,127 --> 01:16:08,346
He also says that you're a low criminal and a...

1791
01:16:08,381 --> 01:16:09,598
That's not what I said!

1792
01:16:09,633 --> 01:16:10,465
Shut up!

1793
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:12,165
One more interruption and out you go.

1794
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,369
Did you say you wouldn't represent him anymore?

1795
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:15,237
Yes or no?

1796
01:16:15,564 --> 01:16:16,937
Yes.

1797
01:16:16,972 --> 01:16:18,273
Did you say he was a low criminal?

1798
01:16:18,308 --> 01:16:19,068
Yes.

1799
01:16:19,103 --> 01:16:20,007
Then shut up.

1800
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:22,586
Have you seen this man before last night?

1801
01:16:23,591 --> 01:16:24,628
Well?

1802
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,149
I got to think.

1803
01:16:26,184 --> 01:16:28,402
Don't hurt yourself.

1804
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:30,784
He also said that you're involved

1805
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:32,587
in the blackmail scheme.

1806
01:16:34,322 --> 01:16:36,924
Yeah, I've seen him before last night.

1807
01:16:36,925 --> 01:16:38,009
I've seen him lots.

1808
01:16:38,044 --> 01:16:39,219
Dozens of times.

1809
01:16:39,254 --> 01:16:40,395
Right, brother?

1810
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:42,563
You lousy rat.

1811
01:16:42,564 --> 01:16:43,396
Sit down!

1812
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:45,166
He's in it up to his ears.

1813
01:16:45,201 --> 01:16:46,034
That's a lie!

1814
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:48,298
You led him into this.

1815
01:16:48,333 --> 01:16:49,035
Maybe so...

1816
01:16:49,070 --> 01:16:53,056
but I got all I need right now, Mr. Horan.

1817
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:54,076
You're being detained

1818
01:16:54,111 --> 01:16:55,386
as a material witness

1819
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:56,766
in a murder and extortion case.

1820
01:16:56,801 --> 01:16:59,047
Purley. Get him out of here and take the others with you.

1821
01:16:59,082 --> 01:17:01,181
Let's go, boys.

1822
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:09,856
It's 9:00. My orchids.

1823
01:17:10,548 --> 01:17:12,494
You mean you're just going to leave when...

1824
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:13,326
When what?

1825
01:17:13,361 --> 01:17:15,313
You've got this retch cornered

1826
01:17:15,348 --> 01:17:17,230
and you're clawing away at him

1827
01:17:17,265 --> 01:17:20,302
to get at another retch... that unspeakable Horan.

1828
01:17:20,337 --> 01:17:22,225
I'm not after blackmailers.

1829
01:17:22,260 --> 01:17:23,303
I'm after a murderer.

1830
01:17:23,338 --> 01:17:25,507
You can deal with them just as effectively elsewhere.

1831
01:17:25,542 --> 01:17:27,145
You bet I can.

1832
01:17:27,180 --> 01:17:29,159
And I'm going to take your men with me...

1833
01:17:29,194 --> 01:17:30,337
all four of them.

1834
01:17:30,372 --> 01:17:31,286
You may have three of them

1835
01:17:31,321 --> 01:17:33,315
but not Mr. Cather, he's not here.

1836
01:17:33,350 --> 01:17:35,483
Where is he? I want him.

1837
01:17:35,518 --> 01:17:36,802
You can't have him.

1838
01:17:36,837 --> 01:17:38,051
He's on an errand.

1839
01:17:38,086 --> 01:17:41,122
Haven't I given you enough for one morning?

1840
01:17:42,352 --> 01:17:43,291
Archie, do you remember where

1841
01:17:43,326 --> 01:17:44,557
Orrie has gone?

1842
01:17:44,592 --> 01:17:46,328
Couldn't remember to save me.

1843
01:17:46,363 --> 01:17:48,355
Good. Don't try.

1844
01:17:50,884 --> 01:17:53,436
<i>And the truth was I didn't have the smallest idea</i>

1845
01:17:53,471 --> 01:17:55,870
<i>where Orrie was.</i>

1846
01:17:59,426 --> 01:18:01,367
<i>I've never seen as much top brass in one day</i>

1847
01:18:01,402 --> 01:18:03,273
<i>as I did during the next eight hours.</i>

1848
01:18:03,308 --> 01:18:06,199
<i>Finally, they tied up a reasonably accurate statement</i>

1849
01:18:06,234 --> 01:18:07,144
<i>and I was sent down</i>

1850
01:18:07,179 --> 01:18:09,751
<i>to police commissioner Walter Neary's office.</i>

1851
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:11,398
Howdy, commish, what's up?

1852
01:18:11,433 --> 01:18:13,221
So tell me about this deal with Jean Estey.

1853
01:18:13,256 --> 01:18:13,841
Again?

1854
01:18:13,876 --> 01:18:15,003
It looks different now.

1855
01:18:15,038 --> 01:18:16,472
Well, I was over there I talked to a few...

1856
01:18:16,507 --> 01:18:17,993
And Mrs. Horan and Angela Wright...

1857
01:18:18,028 --> 01:18:19,311
whose idea was that?

1858
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:20,621
Hey, that's you.

1859
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:21,896
So, Wolfe knew.

1860
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,065
I'll have to think about that one.

1861
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:26,199
That fat son of a bitch.

1862
01:18:27,354 --> 01:18:28,529
He said he's ready to earn the money

1863
01:18:28,564 --> 01:18:30,572
Mrs. Fromm paid him to identify the murderer.

1864
01:18:30,607 --> 01:18:32,706
He wants Stebbins and me.

1865
01:18:32,741 --> 01:18:34,476
He wants the five people chiefly involved.

1866
01:18:34,511 --> 01:18:35,913
And if that's not enough

1867
01:18:35,948 --> 01:18:38,813
he wants three or four policewomen... not in uniform.

1868
01:18:38,848 --> 01:18:40,565
He wants you immediately.

1869
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:42,283
He wants Durkin, Panzer

1870
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:43,550
and Egan.

1871
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:47,055
And he says we'll be bringing the murderer with us.

1872
01:18:47,489 --> 01:18:49,189
He's a maniac. Insufferable.

1873
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:50,129
Get him down here.

1874
01:18:50,164 --> 01:18:50,924
He won't come.

1875
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:51,585
You bring him.

1876
01:18:51,620 --> 01:18:52,682
Got a warrant?

1877
01:18:52,717 --> 01:18:53,709
I'll get it.

1878
01:18:53,744 --> 01:18:56,164
Commissioner, he won't open his mouth.

1879
01:18:56,199 --> 01:18:56,997
He'll get out on bail

1880
01:18:57,032 --> 01:18:58,934
Go home and do his own inviting.

1881
01:18:58,969 --> 01:19:00,033
Without us.

1882
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:01,768
Well, I'll see you gentlemen later.

1883
01:19:01,803 --> 01:19:03,538
Always a pleasure commish.

1884
01:19:10,678 --> 01:19:13,515
Would someone please tell me what this is all about?

1885
01:19:14,793 --> 01:19:16,117
I'm inspector Cramer.

1886
01:19:16,901 --> 01:19:18,685
New York homicide.

1887
01:19:19,117 --> 01:19:21,756
I want you to understand that this is official.

1888
01:19:21,791 --> 01:19:23,023
Only up to a point.

1889
01:19:24,213 --> 01:19:26,498
You were brought here by the police department.

1890
01:19:26,533 --> 01:19:29,370
With the approval of the D.A.

1891
01:19:29,564 --> 01:19:32,132
I'm done with you.

1892
01:19:32,979 --> 01:19:36,071
But now, Nero Wolfe will proceed on his own.

1893
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:37,771
I want you to understand

1894
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:40,373
that he has, uh, no authority

1895
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:44,312
to insist on any answers to any questions he may ask.

1896
01:19:44,347 --> 01:19:46,915
You understand that?

1897
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:06,000
This is, uh...

1898
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:07,302
a little awkward.

1899
01:20:08,293 --> 01:20:10,794
I... have only seen two of you before...

1900
01:20:10,829 --> 01:20:15,508
Mr. Horan and Mr. Kuffner.

1901
01:20:15,543 --> 01:20:22,050
Mr. Goodwin has provided me with a chart, but I'd like to check.

1902
01:20:22,085 --> 01:20:23,785
You're miss Jean Estey?

1903
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,086
Yes.

1904
01:20:26,821 --> 01:20:28,990
Mrs. Angela Wright?

1905
01:20:29,025 --> 01:20:31,124
Cheer up.

1906
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,026
Mrs. Denis Horan?

1907
01:20:32,460 --> 01:20:33,029
I don't see...

1908
01:20:33,064 --> 01:20:34,160
Mr. Goodwin tells me

1909
01:20:34,195 --> 01:20:36,364
you have a charming little pet.

1910
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,041
Thank you all for coming.

1911
01:20:49,689 --> 01:20:52,725
Uh, this is the first time I've undertaken

1912
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,786
to single out a murderer from a group of mostly strangers.

1913
01:20:55,821 --> 01:20:58,160
It seems a little presumptuous

1914
01:20:58,195 --> 01:20:59,787
but let's see.

1915
01:21:02,857 --> 01:21:07,164
I have no questions to ask

1916
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:11,499
but indeed I have questions to ask of myself.

1917
01:21:11,534 --> 01:21:13,199
For instance...

1918
01:21:13,234 --> 01:21:17,138
why did Mrs. Fromm wear those golden spider earrings

1919
01:21:17,173 --> 01:21:20,469
when she came to see me?

1920
01:21:20,504 --> 01:21:24,946
Answer: they were part of an attempted imposture.

1921
01:21:24,981 --> 01:21:26,646
She wanted to impersonate

1922
01:21:26,681 --> 01:21:29,284
the woman who was wearing them in the car

1923
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:33,188
in order to find out what I knew.

1924
01:21:33,621 --> 01:21:34,888
Another question.

1925
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:40,128
Why did Mr. Horan go to the factory last night?

1926
01:21:40,163 --> 01:21:41,828
Answer: because

1927
01:21:41,863 --> 01:21:45,949
his greed had impelled him to a foolish action

1928
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:49,671
giving Leopold Heim's name and address to Mr. Lips Egan

1929
01:21:49,706 --> 01:21:50,409
and he was alarmed.

1930
01:21:50,444 --> 01:21:51,297
I protest.

1931
01:21:51,332 --> 01:21:54,008
Inspector Cramer, this is slander.

1932
01:21:54,043 --> 01:21:56,142
You're a lawyer. Sue him.

1933
01:21:56,177 --> 01:21:58,968
Mr. Horan. If I were you I'd stop blathering

1934
01:21:59,003 --> 01:21:59,881
About your implication

1935
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:01,347
in blackmail and extortion.

1936
01:22:01,382 --> 01:22:03,516
On that you're sunk, and you know it

1937
01:22:03,551 --> 01:22:07,021
and now you're confronted with a much greater danger...

1938
01:22:07,056 --> 01:22:10,601
identification as the murderer of Pete Drossos.

1939
01:22:10,636 --> 01:22:11,758
But, I-I...

1940
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:15,121
You can't possibly escape a term in jail

1941
01:22:15,156 --> 01:22:18,449
but with my help you may go on living.

1942
01:22:20,034 --> 01:22:21,057
I suppose most of you

1943
01:22:21,092 --> 01:22:24,175
know nothing of the extortion enterprise

1944
01:22:24,210 --> 01:22:26,510
which has resulted in the death of three people.

1945
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:29,143
So you can't follow me throughout

1946
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:31,850
but one of you will most assuredly

1947
01:22:31,885 --> 01:22:33,915
be able to follow me.

1948
01:22:35,267 --> 01:22:36,623
Where do I begin?

1949
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:41,072
With the golden spider earrings.

1950
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:43,800
Unusual and very unattractive.

1951
01:22:43,835 --> 01:22:48,383
Why would a woman of taste

1952
01:22:48,418 --> 01:22:53,940
like Mrs. Fromm, upon seeing these earrings

1953
01:22:53,975 --> 01:22:56,791
in a store window, be motivated to purchase them?

1954
01:22:56,826 --> 01:22:58,779
Perhaps she didn't find them unattractive.

1955
01:22:59,073 --> 01:23:00,773
Tastes differ? Ptooey.

1956
01:23:00,808 --> 01:23:03,444
Do you remember Mr. Lips Egan

1957
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,609
saying that in phoning him

1958
01:23:05,644 --> 01:23:07,564
a woman used a password?

1959
01:23:07,599 --> 01:23:09,484
What was it, Mr. Egan?

1960
01:23:10,351 --> 01:23:12,954
"Said the spider to a fly. "

1961
01:23:13,388 --> 01:23:17,158
Exactly. "Said the spider... "

1962
01:23:17,193 --> 01:23:21,629
Perhaps Mrs. Fromm had overheard that peculiar password used

1963
01:23:21,664 --> 01:23:25,967
and the impulse struck her to play a kind of game

1964
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:28,986
with those who she thought might be involved.

1965
01:23:29,003 --> 01:23:29,836
What game?

1966
01:23:29,871 --> 01:23:32,473
Possibly to see if anyone would respond.

1967
01:23:32,907 --> 01:23:35,908
What we do know

1968
01:23:35,943 --> 01:23:38,980
is that a woman wearing those earrings

1969
01:23:39,015 --> 01:23:41,149
was driving a car with a man

1970
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,849
and mouthed the words

1971
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:46,372
"Help. Get a cop. " to a boy named Pete Drossos

1972
01:23:46,407 --> 01:23:49,885
And the car suddenly drove off.

1973
01:23:50,746 --> 01:23:52,947
The next day, the same car

1974
01:23:52,982 --> 01:23:56,379
now driven by a man, ran over the boy

1975
01:23:56,414 --> 01:23:58,090
at a fairly busy intersection.

1976
01:23:58,125 --> 01:23:59,766
We know it was a man driving

1977
01:23:59,801 --> 01:24:03,271
because witnesses caught a glimpse of him.

1978
01:24:03,306 --> 01:24:04,572
So, obviously...

1979
01:24:05,006 --> 01:24:06,090
the driver was the man

1980
01:24:06,125 --> 01:24:07,175
in the car with the woman

1981
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,476
the day before.

1982
01:24:08,910 --> 01:24:11,512
This seemed obvious because this man would be afraid

1983
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:13,247
that Pete Drossos could identify him.

1984
01:24:13,282 --> 01:24:15,590
But that theory was invalidated

1985
01:24:15,625 --> 01:24:18,573
when I learned that the man in the car with the woman

1986
01:24:18,608 --> 01:24:19,754
was Matthew Birch

1987
01:24:20,188 --> 01:24:23,189
and Matthew Birch had been killed

1988
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:27,562
the nightbefore Pete Drossos was run over.

1989
01:24:28,416 --> 01:24:32,351
So who was the driver?

1990
01:24:32,386 --> 01:24:37,105
I put myself in his place.

1991
01:24:37,538 --> 01:24:41,442
I can't expect to kill the boy at my first attempt.

1992
01:24:41,876 --> 01:24:44,632
I must anticipate driving through that intersection

1993
01:24:44,667 --> 01:24:47,532
several, or even many times.

1994
01:24:47,567 --> 01:24:49,684
There will be people around.

1995
01:24:49,719 --> 01:24:51,384
Witnesses.

1996
01:24:52,298 --> 01:24:53,804
So what do I do?

1997
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:55,665
Wear a mask?

1998
01:24:55,700 --> 01:24:57,457
A false beard?

1999
01:24:58,945 --> 01:25:04,866
No. I proceed with my hazardous and mortal adventure

2000
01:25:04,901 --> 01:25:08,336
dressed in a brown suit

2001
01:25:08,371 --> 01:25:11,299
and a felt hat.

2002
01:25:11,334 --> 01:25:17,330
Manifestly... either I am a peerless dunce

2003
01:25:17,365 --> 01:25:22,216
or... I am a woman.

2004
01:25:26,988 --> 01:25:30,458
Let's say, hypothetically

2005
01:25:30,493 --> 01:25:32,158
I am a woman.

2006
01:25:32,193 --> 01:25:37,973
For if I am a woman, many of the complexities disappear

2007
01:25:38,008 --> 01:25:41,161
since most of the roles now become mine.

2008
01:25:41,196 --> 01:25:45,206
I am, let us say, involved in the blackmailing project.

2009
01:25:45,241 --> 01:25:47,350
I may even direct it.

2010
01:25:47,385 --> 01:25:52,124
Mrs. Fromm catches wind of it, she becomes suspicious.

2011
01:25:52,159 --> 01:25:54,280
She asks me guarded questions.

2012
01:25:54,315 --> 01:25:58,028
She even gives me the spider earrings as a gift

2013
01:25:58,063 --> 01:25:59,485
to provoke a reaction.

2014
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,424
I tell Matthew Birch, one of my accomplices

2015
01:26:03,459 --> 01:26:05,827
about Mrs. Fromm's suspicions.

2016
01:26:05,862 --> 01:26:08,196
He insists upon meeting me.

2017
01:26:08,629 --> 01:26:11,197
He has me drive his car, which is unusual.

2018
01:26:12,274 --> 01:26:16,106
He suddenly produces a gun and orders me to drive somewhere.

2019
01:26:16,141 --> 01:26:17,677
Whatever the cause of his hostility

2020
01:26:17,712 --> 01:26:18,406
I know his character.

2021
01:26:18,441 --> 01:26:19,907
I fear for my life.

2022
01:26:19,942 --> 01:26:21,226
At a corner

2023
01:26:21,261 --> 01:26:22,475
the car stops.

2024
01:26:22,510 --> 01:26:25,546
A boy approaches to wipe my window.

2025
01:26:25,581 --> 01:26:27,434
His face is close to mine.

2026
01:26:27,469 --> 01:26:31,185
I mouth the words, "help. Get a cop. "

2027
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:33,805
Birch prods me and we go.

2028
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:36,355
I recover from my panic.

2029
01:26:37,360 --> 01:26:42,631
Somewhere, sometime, I catch him off-guard and attack.

2030
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:46,171
I disable him, but I do not shoot him.

2031
01:26:46,206 --> 01:26:49,665
I have him in the car, helpless and unconscious

2032
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:53,524
and later that night, I drive to a secluded alley, dump him out

2033
01:26:53,559 --> 01:26:58,828
run his body over several times, park the car, and go home.

2034
01:26:59,380 --> 01:27:01,983
I could make up this story.

2035
01:27:02,018 --> 01:27:03,718
Show me the proof.

2036
01:27:03,753 --> 01:27:05,687
I intend to.

2037
01:27:05,722 --> 01:27:07,587
The next day

2038
01:27:07,622 --> 01:27:12,827
I decide the boy is a threat not to be tolerated.

2039
01:27:12,862 --> 01:27:18,032
He may identify me as Birch's companion in the car.

2040
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:21,736
So that afternoon, dressed as a man

2041
01:27:21,771 --> 01:27:25,406
I get the car from where I parked it...

2042
01:27:26,707 --> 01:27:28,009
and dispatch the boy

2043
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:29,986
Ending that possibility.

2044
01:27:30,021 --> 01:27:30,576
Proof.

2045
01:27:30,611 --> 01:27:32,795
Proof. Where's the proof?

2046
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:33,613
Mrs. Fromm was going

2047
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:37,985
to the Horans' apartment for dinner that night.

2048
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,588
I found her car parked nearby.

2049
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,926
I hid on the floor behind the front seat

2050
01:27:44,961 --> 01:27:47,094
Armed with a tire wrench.

2051
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:49,414
Horan came down with her, but...

2052
01:27:49,449 --> 01:27:50,565
Hold it.

2053
01:27:50,998 --> 01:27:51,866
Hold it!

2054
01:27:53,601 --> 01:27:56,203
I got 'em here, but there's a limit.

2055
01:27:56,238 --> 01:27:58,823
Give me a fact or we're through.

2056
01:27:59,613 --> 01:28:01,409
Archie, let them in, please.

2057
01:28:19,627 --> 01:28:20,928
The red chair.

2058
01:28:29,604 --> 01:28:31,772
My name is Nero Wolfe.

2059
01:28:33,129 --> 01:28:35,025
What is your business, Mr. Levine?

2060
01:28:35,060 --> 01:28:37,845
I'm a partner in B. and S. Levine.

2061
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:40,448
The "S" is for sidney, my brother.

2062
01:28:40,483 --> 01:28:41,714
And the business?

2063
01:28:42,422 --> 01:28:44,134
A clothing store, men's clothing

2064
01:28:44,169 --> 01:28:46,520
on Fillmore street in Brooklyn.

2065
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:47,787
Why are you here?

2066
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:50,649
Well... there was this phone call

2067
01:28:50,684 --> 01:28:51,741
at the store, and a man said

2068
01:28:51,776 --> 01:28:54,094
that this wife had bought for him

2069
01:28:54,129 --> 01:28:56,413
a felt hat and a brown suit last week

2070
01:28:56,448 --> 01:28:57,365
and did we remember about it

2071
01:28:57,400 --> 01:28:59,065
and I said, "sure"

2072
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:03,004
and he said, to make sure, would I describe her, and I did.

2073
01:29:03,039 --> 01:29:05,137
And then, what happened?

2074
01:29:05,172 --> 01:29:06,907
Then he talked me into coming here.

2075
01:29:06,942 --> 01:29:08,425
What a talker that man is.

2076
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:09,909
A salesman he should be.

2077
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:11,644
I want to know about the woman

2078
01:29:11,679 --> 01:29:13,848
who bought the brown suit and felt hat.

2079
01:29:13,883 --> 01:29:15,383
She's here. I saw her

2080
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:16,884
as soon as I sat down.

2081
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:23,824
All right.

2082
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:25,126
It's a fact.

2083
01:29:25,559 --> 01:29:26,426
I was a fool.

2084
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:28,414
I bought the suit for claire Horan.

2085
01:29:28,449 --> 01:29:29,731
She asked me to, and I did it.

2086
01:29:29,766 --> 01:29:30,782
You bitch!

2087
01:29:30,817 --> 01:29:32,031
That's a lie!

2088
01:29:32,066 --> 01:29:34,200
She's a murderer and a liar!

2089
01:29:34,235 --> 01:29:36,837
Shut up! Shut up, you fool! I'll kill you!

2090
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:37,939
I'll kill you!

2091
01:29:37,974 --> 01:29:38,971
All right, Purley.

2092
01:29:39,006 --> 01:29:40,741
Get 'em out of here... all of 'em.

2093
01:29:40,776 --> 01:29:41,843
Get 'em out of here.

2094
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:42,828
Mrs. Horan, too.

2095
01:29:42,863 --> 01:29:43,778
Get her out of here.

2096
01:29:44,732 --> 01:29:46,366
<i>I felt I owed Lon Cohen</i>

2097
01:29:46,401 --> 01:29:47,590
<i>a good shot for his paper.</i>

2098
01:29:47,625 --> 01:29:50,081
<i>He'd done me some good favors</i>

2099
01:29:50,116 --> 01:29:52,538
<i>and now he'd do a few more.</i>

2100
01:30:11,972 --> 01:30:14,141
He said you wanted to see me?

2101
01:30:14,176 --> 01:30:16,310
I said that, Mrs. Drossos.

2102
01:30:19,780 --> 01:30:22,178
Mrs. Drossos, this is for you.

2103
01:30:22,213 --> 01:30:23,537
This is $5,000.

2104
01:30:23,572 --> 01:30:24,517
It's half of Mr. Wolfe's fee.

2105
01:30:24,552 --> 01:30:27,154
You see, Mr. Wolfe and Pete were partners

2106
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:29,288
and he would like you to have that.

2107
01:30:29,323 --> 01:30:32,824
But, I, I, I gave him Pete's money, five dollars.

2108
01:30:32,859 --> 01:30:34,110
I know. Wolfe believes

2109
01:30:34,145 --> 01:30:35,361
that a deal is a deal.

2110
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:38,432
But why does he not give it to me himself?

2111
01:30:38,467 --> 01:30:41,469
Mr. Wolfe, uh, is a bit of a coward, you see.

2112
01:30:41,902 --> 01:30:42,735
A coward?

2113
01:30:44,584 --> 01:30:46,383
He hates to see a woman cry.

2114
01:30:49,710 --> 01:30:51,228
Thank you for coming.

2115
01:30:51,263 --> 01:30:53,089
Fritz will see you home.

2116
01:30:53,124 --> 01:30:54,915
Don't tell him I cried.

2117
01:30:54,950 --> 01:30:56,217
I will not.

2118
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,978
Well, I gave her half of Mrs. Fromm's fee.

2119
01:31:24,845 --> 01:31:26,545
And she took it?

2120
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:30,267
Of course she took it.

2121
01:31:30,302 --> 01:31:33,954
Did she... did she, uh...?

2122
01:31:36,123 --> 01:31:38,292
Maybe when she left the house.

2123
01:31:38,726 --> 01:31:41,762
But not a single tear inthe house.

2124
01:31:43,063 --> 01:31:46,534
Well, that's remarkable, Archie.

2125
01:31:46,569 --> 01:31:49,570
It's very, very remarkable.

2126
01:31:54,775 --> 01:31:57,378
Remarkable.
