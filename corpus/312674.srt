1
00:00:03,436 --> 00:00:05,427
What are the advantages of Vivexx?

2
00:00:06,306 --> 00:00:10,436
Two words: proven efficacy.

3
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,944
Arghhh ooofffi. i. i. (frustrated grumbling)

00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:28,527
This absolutely, the most efficacious drug your
patients can use. (giggling)

7
00:00:29,996 --> 00:00:33,295
Arrrhhhhh aaaaahhhhh (screaming)

8
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,030
Our drug is clearly the most efficaciousest!

9
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,471
Arrrhhhhh aaaaahhhhh (panting)

10
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,506
Is efficaciousest even a word?.

11
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:50,449
(heavy breathing)

12
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:00,559
#

13
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,130
My name is Karly Hert. I sell drugs for a living.

14
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:17,202
Legally that is.

15
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,897
I am a pharmaceutical sales consultant.

16
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,936
You're probably thinking that I have a medical
background, maybe a nursing or pharmacy
degree.

17
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,380
Well, I do have a science degree......

18
00:02:28,615 --> 00:02:31,083
political science, that is.

19
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,850
How then did I get this job?.

20
00:02:33,686 --> 00:02:36,154
You're recruiting me to be a pharmaceutical
consultant?.

21
00:02:36,389 --> 00:02:37,617
Yea, isn't that exciting?.

22
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:39,851
Um, but I sell cellular phones....

23
00:02:40,226 --> 00:02:43,662
You know... in college I took a weather class to
fulfill my science credit.

24
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,161
Ahh, well they can teach you all that stuff.

25
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,468
They are just looking for someone with.....
ample......

26
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:51,261
(bell "ding")

27
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:52,695
sales experience.

28
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,672
Oh...

29
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:01,436
(chuckling) Did I mention that you would get a
company car?.

30
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,479
(narrated) A free car?.

31
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,618
I was 23, I still owned 1 0's of thousands of dollars
in student loans

32
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:12,157
and had no idea what I would actually be doing in
this new consultant job.

33
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,383
But a free car?.?.?.?.

34
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,889
AWESOME!

35
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,156
(Laughing)

36
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:23,124
(narrated) It wasn't like I didn't have a car.

37
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,770
(narrated) But a new free car?.

38
00:03:31,911 --> 00:03:34,277
(narrated) I was almost as excited about the car
and salary jump...

39
00:03:34,447 --> 00:03:36,847
(narrated) as my mom was about other benefits
that came with the job.

40
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,815
(narrated) almost.

41
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,789
Honey, I know you are going to marry a nice
doctor, I just know it (weeping)

42
00:03:46,326 --> 00:03:47,725
I did meet a lot of doctors,

43
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:52,160
but to my mother's dismay, the more I met, the
more I knew I would never, ever marry a doctor.

44
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,396
Hi Dr. Jacobs.

45
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,727
Yea?. What?.

46
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:58,563
Uh, your nurse said you needed some samples
for the office,

47
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:03,334
so I just need a quick John Hancock if you don't
mind. Great.

48
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:06,607
Thanks.... Uh, OK.

49
00:04:08,381 --> 00:04:14,581
So, if you notice in the graph there just been,
really uh really great long term affects on the
patients.

50
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:20,659
We can send you some stuff and you know, I think
the results really prove themselves.

51
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:22,190
Sure.

52
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,457
So, if you just want to you know, look at the
material, it sort of speaks for itself.

53
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:35,336
OK, great. Thank you. Would you like to go out
with me sometime?. On a personal level?.

54
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,744
I'd love to.

55
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:42,209
OK.

56
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:48,048
I can't this week, next week looks bad too, and I
am at a conference the following week...

57
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:51,721
but it looks like I can squeeze you in one month
from today.

58
00:04:52,358 --> 00:04:56,556
But it would have to be at 6:0AM, maybe for
coffee.

59
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,661
(narrated) My name is Karly Hert.

60
00:04:58,831 --> 00:05:00,492
(narrated) Did I say I am a drug dealer?.

61
00:05:01,501 --> 00:05:05,494
(narrated) I was a drug dealer. This is my story.

62
00:05:06,272 --> 00:05:12,233
# You're a love cat-kitty all the world will never
pity you...

63
00:06:18,644 --> 00:06:23,445
(narrated) The company manual outlines several
rules for a successful career as a pharmaceutical
representative.

64
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:24,583

God, I'm starving!

70
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:47,772

71
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,034

Hello, I'm Karly Hert with Braden-Andrews.

81
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,412
Are these your samples on the back?.

82
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:05,107
Yes.

83
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,611
We will get to you when we can.

00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:10,984
(narrated) Rule number 6: develop positive
relationships with all staff members.

85
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:14,957
You know, periwinkle is really your color, Betty.

86
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:15,957
Oh Fred.

87
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,188
It is. Say, are the docs in?.

88
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:21,523
You bet, come on back.

89
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:30,441
(narrated) Rule number 7: Always carry yourself
with poise and grace.

90

00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,125
Darn it.

94
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:19,082
Well, we just received the latest Festril weeklies
and as you can see, we have really flattened off.

95
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:23,025
But didn't we just have 4 weeks straight of record
market share gains?.

96
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,896
As the saying goes... what have you done for me
lately?.

97
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,263
Listen people, the name of the game - is growth.
Ok.

98
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:35,137
Now, our competitors may pat themselves on the
back for past accomplishments, but not us.

99
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,242
That's what makes us stand apart.

100
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,704
Scott, where is Dr. Schmidt at in terms of Festril
prescriptions?.

101
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,047
About 2%.

102
00:09:42,214 --> 00:09:43,875
Why isn't he onboard yet?.

103
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,084
He likes to wait at least a year before prescribing
any new drugs, it's a safety issue.

104
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,518
He also likes to reserve the quinolones for
compromised patients.

105
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:55,158
What kind of idiot would reserve the most
effective drug on the market?. What's his reason?.

106
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:59,688
Well, because last year when we didn't have our
own quinolones to sell

107
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:03,164
we were calling him an idiot for using such a big
gun when it wasn't absolutely necessary.

108
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,263
Well, it looks like you did your job a little too well
last year.

109
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,869
Have you invited him out to Corporate yet?.

110
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:10,838
No, but I was going to do that later.

111
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:15,310
I want him flown out with Corporate. Also, make
sure he is signed up for the webcast with Dr. Sing.

112
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:18,240
I want you in his office twice a week for the next
three. Got it?.

113
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:20,051
Yep got it.

114
00:10:20,219 --> 00:10:22,915
Ok. Just remember people the company has a
really big goal to hit.

115
00:10:23,089 --> 00:10:28,220
We have until December to hit the mega double.
Double the profits, double the growth.

116
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:35,629
Let's keep our fingers crossed for a really bad
respiratory season; lots of pneumonia, lots of sinus
infections. (chuckling)

117
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:39,265
Also, keep in mind that we that we are gearing up
for the Vivexx launch.

118
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:44,132
Potentially the biggest drug to hit the market ever!

119
00:10:44,777 --> 00:10:48,577
So, are we all on the same page?.

120
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:53,042
Listen, just remember team...

121
00:10:53,352 --> 00:11:01,817
...what our job really is ultimately about is to
protect and prolong human life.

122
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,131
It's the Braden-Andrews Credo.

123
00:11:06,966 --> 00:11:09,093
All right get out of here, have a good weekend.

124
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,699
Karly.

125
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,007
Yea

126
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:21,769
Just a word with you. Actually the district
numbers weren't down that bad over all.

127
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:24,006
What dragged us down was your territory.

128
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,917
um um, well I.

129
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,119
I don't want excuses, OK I just want you to get the
job done.

130
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,682
Corporate will not hesitate to get somebody who
will.

131
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,825
OK

132
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:42,930
Oh, and I almost forgot, you are now going to be
doing reminder calls for Glucadox..

133
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:45,793
I don't know anything about diabetes.

134
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:47,070
It's just a reminder.

135
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:52,070
But what if the doctor asks me something about
the drug or the disease or other treatments?.

136
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:55,778
Then just refer him to our medical department.

137
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,240
OK

138
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,145
Are you on board here Karly?.

139
00:11:59,318 --> 00:12:02,082
Yea.

140
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,651
Okay.

141
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,887
Nice stain.

142
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,059
Yea. Thanks.

143
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:13,992
Hi Dad.

144
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:22,198
Yea honey, I don't know if I am going to able to
make the trip. Things are a little tight around here.

145
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:28,175
No problem. Okay.

146
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,850
Rough day?.

147
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:42,255
Did I just see you at the rep meeting?.

148
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:45,695
Unfortunately, yea.

149
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,900
I haven't seen you around here before.

150
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,969
And you won't. This is my first and last week.

151
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,831
Really?.

152
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:57,168
Uh-huh.

153
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:08,278
So then he says to me, "Do you think you could
snag me a couple samples of Viagra?. "

154
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:12,056
and I'm like how the heck are you supposed to
respond to that?.

155
00:13:12,258 --> 00:13:16,217
Um Dad, I'm not sure I should be snagging you
samples of anything.

156
00:13:18,164 --> 00:13:20,325
Oh God, I can't believe I just told you that story.

157
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,458
He sounds like quite the funny guy.

158
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:28,767
So tell me again, you're going to quit just like that?.

159
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,805
Just like that.

160
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,477
I wish I could quit.

161
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,277
Then do it.

162
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:37,006
You make it sound so easy.

163
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:41,249
Well you're making it more difficult than it is.

164
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,287
Yeah, but what about bills and having to buy a car.

165
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:49,450
Hey, can we finish this conversation tomorrow?.
There is something I want to show you.

166
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:52,261
(giggling) I'd love to.

167
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:54,433
# There was something in the air....

168
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:56,094
# There was something in the air....

169
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,216
This is gorgeous.

170
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:22,292
We're only 1 0 miles from town?.

171
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:25,927
Would you like to come in?.

172
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,794
What is this?.

173
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:37,475
This, is the kitchen, where I imagine you will be
cooking me breakfast in about 1 2 months.

174
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:41,907
(laughing) Well, that is highly unlikely for several
reasons.

175
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,480
Such as?.

176
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,148
Number 1, I can't cook a lick.

177
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,348
Ok, well I will put a toaster right here. You can
operate a toaster can't you?.

178
00:14:51,523 --> 00:14:53,491
Well, that brings us to problem number 2.

179
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:57,989
How is someone without a job going to buy the
bread to make the toast?.

180
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,201
Ohhhhh independently wealthy. I see.

181
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,002
I've been saving for this for about 1 0 years.

182
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:13,242
Saving?.

183
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,850
So you're going to build it all by yourself?.

184
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,053
I have a couple friends who will help me out.

185
00:15:24,223 --> 00:15:26,418
I don't do electricity.

186
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:31,927
I learned that lesson the hard way... still waiting
for it to completely grow back (laughing)

187
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,066
(laughing) You lie.

188
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:41,530
So I suppose they told you it was all about helping
physicians help patients.

189
00:15:41,907 --> 00:15:46,401
oh yea. And objectively educating doctors.

190
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,541
It sounded great though.

191
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:55,547
An interesting worthwhile job with the added
bonus of helping fund my building project.

192
00:15:57,389 --> 00:16:03,988
They just forgot to mention the manipulation,
bribery, the exploitation factor.

193
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:07,094
Okay, well it's not that bad.

194
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:15,071
Yea, it's actually worse. It goes all the way back
to the decision of which drugs to research.

195
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:26,315
Let's see. Do we make more money if we
develop a cure for cancer or develop another
useless drug for sinus infections?.

196
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:32,316
Yea, but what about all the patients who are
helped?.

197
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:34,983
What about all the patients that are hurt?.

198
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,220
What about the ignorance of the doctors?.

199
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,399
What about the ignorance of the reps?.

200
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:49,267
You know I read this article once (clears throat) by
a physician that reps know just enough to get by.

201
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:58,474
At first I was really defensive about it. And then I
realized, we are just one sentence away from
complete negligence.

202
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:06,489
I mean there is just something fundamentally
unethical about tying profit to educating doctors
and helping patients.

203
00:17:06,658 --> 00:17:08,285
Wow.

204
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,358
Wow what?.

205
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,020
How can you possibly feel that way about it and
continue doing it.

206
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:16,258
I need the money.

207
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,595
Don't forget the car.

208
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:20,136
And the pension plan.

209
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,068
and the stock options.

210
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:27,004
And integrity and a passion for what you do.

211
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:30,080
And overall happiness.

212
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:35,316
There are other jobs out there.

213
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:45,259
You know your biggest problem isn't the industry,
it's you.

214
00:17:53,672 --> 00:17:56,470
(sigh)

215
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:16,755
Excuse me Dr. Scott. What is your opinion of
pharmaceutical representatives?.

216
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:20,125
You want to know what I think?.

217
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:23,029
I don't believe a damn thing that comes out of
their mouths.

218
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:28,196
They'll say anything to push their drugs. Most of
them are dumber than a box of rocks.

219
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:33,506
Scourge of the Earth.

220
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:40,582
Glucadox is the most effective drug on the market
for the treatment of diabetes.

221
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:52,822
We have had a 60%% improvement in our
production efficiency. We have the cost of
Glucadox down to 1 0 cents a pill.

222
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:58,530
The bottom line is that Glucadox saves lives.

223
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:03,535
Wow! It looks like Braden-Andrews gave us a
great deal, only 1 2 bucks a pill on Glucadox.

224
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:08,779
You cannot put a price tag...

225
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:15,610
...on the increased quality of life patients will
experience with Glucadox.

226
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:21,322
30 tablets of Glucadox, comes to a total of $580.

227
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:26,689
Well, I don't have that kind of money.

228
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:29,095
Don't you have insurance?.

229
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:31,526
I got laid off.

230
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:41,677
(clapping)

231
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:52,482
If we can get our top five Festril writers to grow by
1 0%%...

232
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:55,388
...that should move our overall market share by
3%%.

233
00:19:55,561 --> 00:19:57,256
We'd be in the running for the trip to Greece.

234
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,897
Plus a very nice bonus package.

235
00:20:00,232 --> 00:20:04,760
What about a speaker program at Le Fleur?. That
restaurant always brings the doctors in.

236
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,337
Or Green Bay Football tickets with a party bus.

237
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,608
I can take Dr. Scallon and Waters to the spa.

238
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:15,475
What?. I could you a massage and a manicure, as
long as Uncle Andrews is paying.

239
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,579
What do you think Karly?.

240
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:26,491
Bzzzzzzzzzz. (Alarm clock ringing)

241
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:27,685
Bzzzzzzzzzz. (Alarm clock ringing)

242
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,636
# (whistling.....) I was thinking yesterday....

243
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,227
(singing) You are so tasty.

244
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,231
Love suits you well, missy.

245
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,395
Love?. Who said anything about love?. I'm
quitting my job.

246
00:21:47,572 --> 00:21:49,301
What did you just say?.

247
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:54,377
Don't get your panties in a bundle. I'm not quitting
today.

248
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:57,777
I'm quitting October 30th, exactly 6 months from
today.

249
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:59,849
Good for you girl.

250
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:01,383
Thank you.

251
00:22:01,553 --> 00:22:03,680
Ok, so why are you quitting?.

252
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:11,385
I can't do it anymore. I just can't. I'm done,
somebody stick a fork in me, because I am done.

253
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:15,397
I'm done kissing butt, done spinning a bunch of
crap.

254
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:18,832
I'm done looking for angles, done wining and
dining, done.

255
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,739
D-O-N-E DONE!!!!!! Um-hmmm.

256
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,678
So how the heck are you going to do it for the
next 6 months?.

257
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:37,912
Well, I think for the next 6 months I should just do
what I was hired to do, educate the doctors.

258
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,290
So does Zestran work?.

259
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,486
About as well as the others.

260
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:43,524
Price?.

261
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,888
We're more expensive; actually we're almost
double the cost.

262
00:22:47,632 --> 00:22:49,065
Side effects?.

263
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:51,663
Patients won't shit for a week.

264
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,835
I see, well then why should I use Zestran?.

265
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,809
Because I am going to perfectly straight with you.

266
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:07,350
You're going to know exactly what your patients
are getting with this drug: the good, the bad, the
ugly.

267
00:23:07,519 --> 00:23:10,317
Not some sugar coated version with hopes that
you don't know any better.

268
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:14,855
Fine, but tell me how is Festril different than
Tevaquin?.

269
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,325
It's not.

270
00:23:19,998 --> 00:23:22,057
Well, alright then. (laughing)

271
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,203
(laughing)

272
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:31,431
# Feed your body with rythym and soul. Step in
the sunshine...

273
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,646
Oh, I'm taking that one. Yea

274
00:23:46,825 --> 00:23:49,350
Yea right, like you can eat all that.

275
00:23:49,528 --> 00:23:51,359
ohhhhh watch me.

276
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,655
My God.

277
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:59,669
You know I haven't ever really figured out this
whole grill your own deal. Doesn't it defeat the
purpose of...

278
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,897
...going out to eat and having somebody else
cook for you?.

279
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:09,642
Not if you still like it mooing. Just give me a cow
and a salt shaker and I am one happy camper.

280
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:13,082
You're like no woman I've ever met.

281
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,420
Is that a compliment?.

282
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,145
Sure.

283
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,787
You know I would never have had the balls to do
this, if it wasn't for you.

284
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,157
Well, I'm hoping you still don't have any balls.

285
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:27,498
(laugh)

286
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:30,635
Here's to 6 months.

287
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:36,100
Bzzzzzzzzzz. (Alarm clock ringing)

288
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,429
# I can't wait one minute more...

289
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,639
So you know, just look at the results and you will
see.

290
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,643
What is that?.

291
00:25:15,881 --> 00:25:17,746
Chocolate.

292
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,782
(laughing)

293
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:26,123
Hi, we have turkey or chicken.

294
00:25:39,170 --> 00:25:43,573
Sandwiches, not quite like the good old days, is it
girls?.

295
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,577
What the...?.

296
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,191
(Heavy breathing)

297
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:20,975
You know if I had another 20 or 30 pounds on me,

298
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,115
I probably could have won with brute force too.

299
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:31,748
Well, I like a little meat on a girl.

300
00:26:34,192 --> 00:26:35,989
Grace?.

301
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,728
Gracie?.

302
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,562
Gracie?.

303
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,563
What's that matter Gracie?.

304
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,201
It's Friday.

305
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:52,199
Yes it is. Most people are really happy about that.

306
00:26:58,316 --> 00:27:03,549
You know it's Friday, and here I am without a
date....again.

307
00:27:03,755 --> 00:27:05,552
I don't have a date.

308
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:10,320
Well that's different, you, you have one in the
hopper. You always have one in the hopper.

309
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:12,921
It will happen Grace.

310
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:17,660
You don't understand. I'm bigger than 90%% of the
guys out there.

311
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:24,166
Well, look at it this way, you can tell which ones
are prematurely balding.

312
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,610
Well, there is that.

313
00:28:00,745 --> 00:28:01,712
(giggling)

314
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,848
All right, all right.

315
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,677
Where are you taking me?.

316
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:08,842
Ahhh stop, you can't look.

317
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:18,987
You wanna help me get a dog?.

318
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:23,624
Oh my God. I would love to.

319
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:30,000
All right let's go.

320
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,975
Too pretentious.

321
00:28:37,182 --> 00:28:38,809
Kind of fluffy.

322
00:28:38,983 --> 00:28:40,314
Pink bows.

323
00:28:40,685 --> 00:28:42,152
(laughing)

324
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,120
(Barking)

325
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,848
Bad with kids. No way.

326
00:28:47,025 --> 00:28:49,084
(Laughing)

327
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,021
(Barking)

328
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,059
Going nuts.

329
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,791
It's too yappy.

330
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:06,911
Oh Zach, ohhhh look how sweet he is. Oh my
God.

331
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,842
He's cute, but there is no way I am ready for a
puppy.

332
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:11,675
Ah come on.

333
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:14,683
Too much getting up in the middle of the night with
a pooper scooper.

334
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:16,320
Too much training.

335
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:20,389
Yeah, you are probably right.

336
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,197
I love this dog.

337
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:31,027
Yea, it's a good dog. Good puppy.

338
00:29:31,469 --> 00:29:37,430
We're going to live over there, we're going to live
over there.

339
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,446
Going down the road.

340
00:29:42,814 --> 00:29:43,974
Going downtown.

341
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,014
I think he's getting car sick, or she.

342
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,250
I like my marshmallows burnt.

343
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:10,773
Oh no, gotta feed her first. She's the lady.

344
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,069
Ladies first.

345
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,313
What, no poker?.

346
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:29,156
How tall are you anyway?.

347
00:30:29,394 --> 00:30:31,521
Here we go. I'm 6'1 ".

348
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:35,156
Wow, I like a lot of woman.

349
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,135
OK

350
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:43,971
Knock, knock.

351
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:46,110
Come in.

352
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,887
(laughing)

353
00:31:10,435 --> 00:31:13,802
Hi, how are you?.

354
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,579
Are you tired?.

355
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,479
No.

356
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:51,075
Oh my God, does it get any better than this?.

357
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:10,284
# Just isn't love without you there.

358
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,984
(laughing)

359
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:48,381
(murmering)

360
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:52,396
Are you going to try harder?. I don't get it.

361
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:53,723
Yes. Okay.

362
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,400
It's unacceptable....

363
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,109
Oh honey.

364
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:09,569
Happy belated birthday!

365
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,510
Thanks Dad!

366
00:34:11,682 --> 00:34:14,116
You know, I was thinking on the way over here...

367
00:34:14,285 --> 00:34:20,246
Had I boinked your mother 3 days earlier, you'd
have been an easter baby. (chuckling)

368
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,518
Yea, imagine that.

369
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:35,502
Oh here Dad, just a little gas money.

370
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:38,609
Thanks.

371
00:34:40,311 --> 00:34:41,278
Bye.

372
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:42,413
Bye.

373
00:34:56,327 --> 00:34:57,487
Thanks.

374
00:35:03,334 --> 00:35:06,394
Interesting.

375
00:35:12,577 --> 00:35:14,772
(ding-dong)

376
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:24,688
Good morning Dan, oh Jacqueline I wasn't
expecting you to join us this morning.

377
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:29,725
We need to have a little chat about your recent
performance.

378
00:35:33,598 --> 00:35:38,831
Uh, do we have to do this here?.

379
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:44,299
Go on inside, daddy will be right there.

380
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,865
What about this stuff?.

381
00:36:08,232 --> 00:36:10,462
Just toss it.

382
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:17,573
I'll need the keys to your car.

383
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,257
Where's Scott?.

384
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:58,213
People, let's just make sure we have the message
locked and loaded.

385
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:04,410
We need to be ready to hit the ground running the
moment Vivexx gets approval.

386
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:13,152
But before we start our grinders, I thought maybe
we could get a few words from the comeback kid.

387
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:21,528
According to the weeklies, Karly has had a market
share gain of 5%% each week for the last 5 weeks.

388
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:28,269
Congratulations Karly. What's your secret?.

389
00:37:30,548 --> 00:37:34,416
I'm just trying to do my job the best way I know
how.

390
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:42,585
Practice makes perfect folks, let's get started with
1 0 sets of grinders.

391
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:52,431
Remember the only way to enjoy instant success
with Viivexx, is to have our message locked and
loaded.

392
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:59,335
Ready - Set - Start!

393
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:06,307
Dr. Smith, I'd like to introduce you to Betty. Betty
was voted most likely to succeed.

394
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:13,523
Unfortunately for Betty depression interfered with
her plans. Do you have any patients like Betty in
your practice?.

395
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,692
Well, yes, quite a few.

396
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:22,288
Well Dr. Smith, today I would like to tell you why
new Viivexx is the drug of choice in patients like
Betty.

397
00:38:22,667 --> 00:38:27,536
Vivexx offers your patients proven unsurpassed
clinical efficacy.

398
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,740
Stop and move.

399
00:38:33,511 --> 00:38:34,603
Start.

400
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:41,307
Dr. Smith, I'd like to introduce you to Betty. Betty
was voted most likely to succeed.

401
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:47,751
Unfortunately for Betty depression interfered with
her plans. Do you have any patients like Betty in
your practice?.

402
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:49,256
Well, yes, quite a few.

403
00:38:49,427 --> 00:38:54,023
blah, blah, blah, blah, I'm sorry you were saying?.

404
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:55,922
... in patients like Betty.

405
00:38:56,467 --> 00:39:01,370
The last time we launched a drug like Vivexx, I
bought my house with the bonus check.

406
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,670
Karly, could you come here a minute?.

407
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,577
You keep up this pace and you're going to be
looking at management.

408
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:17,014
There's a thought.

409
00:39:17,388 --> 00:39:21,017
Oh and one more thing, Dan could you excuse us
a moment?.

410
00:39:21,392 --> 00:39:22,359
Sure.

411
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:23,493
Thanks.

412
00:39:25,363 --> 00:39:34,761
Now this is somewhat of a sensitive topic, but if
you look around, you'll notice that this is quite a
conservative company.

413
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:39,907
I'm sorry, I'm not quite sure I know what you
mean.

414
00:39:40,077 --> 00:39:44,013
This is so hard,

415
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:47,873
But I think you need to re-evaluate the way you
dress.

416
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,652
I mean, with your recent performance, I would
hate to have you let, a little thing,

417
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:56,520
Iike appearance, get in the way of any career
moves.

418
00:39:58,095 --> 00:40:01,656
I just have your best interest in mind.

419
00:40:05,469 --> 00:40:10,372
I'm sorry. Could you be more specific?. Because
we were told that all meetings were business
casual.

420
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,341
If you take a look at the company dress code,
you'll see that at the very least...

421
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:24,385
You should be wearing panty hose. That would
be a good start.

422
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:31,690
You're one of us now. How do you think I ended
up in management?.

423
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,626
There are rumors.

424
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,565
If you'll excuse me.

425
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:12,860
Excuse me sir, can you share a few thoughts
about your opinion regarding pharmaceutical
representatives?.

426
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,565
Between you and me...

427
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:23,229
If they want send in a nice piece of T&A in here to
tell me about their wonder drug, I'm all for it.

428
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:50,489
$1 5,000... awesome.

429
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:59,068
And this is the top of the line.

430
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:03,872
Ohhh, ohhhh, this one is nice.

431
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,687
(giggling)

432
00:43:16,727 --> 00:43:18,820
Aaaaahhhhh.

433
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:39,777
Beep (fax machine)

434
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:53,120
Holy shit!

435
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,568
I must admit, I was really nervous.

436
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,566
Hey don't you guys have a new drug coming out?.

437
00:44:00,938 --> 00:44:03,566
Yea we do.

438
00:44:03,941 --> 00:44:06,933
It's actually looking like it's going to be pretty
good.

439
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:14,778
I received the latest, expecting the usual.
And...ahhhh...

440
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,653
That's an increase.

441
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:22,655
Wow.

442
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,262
It's quite outstanding.

443
00:44:27,631 --> 00:44:31,590
Hmmmm, surprising.

444
00:44:34,705 --> 00:44:38,937
Wow! It's incredible. I've never seen anything
like it. She's remarkable.

445
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:40,269
And what's her name?.

446
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,908
Karly Hert

447
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:47,915
Make sure we don't lose this one.

448
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:55,017
Ring, ring (telephone)

449
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:56,284
Hello.

450
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,686
Hi Karly, this is Jacqueline, I'm in town this
morning,

451
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:03,697
I'm going to be at the copy shop making some
copies, faxing a few things.

452
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,892
Do you think you could meet me here?.

453
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:08,664
Uh, um, sure.

454
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:09,897
It won't take long.

455
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,905
Okay.

456
00:45:12,076 --> 00:45:16,809
# Can you see my intensity?. Sometimes it's
even too much for me.

457
00:45:52,716 --> 00:46:04,685
# Drowning in too much to do. It's getting late, I
can't afford to lose this time.

458
00:46:23,247 --> 00:46:26,216
There you are, how are you?.

459
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:27,042
Good.

460
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:28,707
Thanks for meeting me.

461
00:46:29,353 --> 00:46:36,418
Listen, I think we got off to a really bad start last
week. I would really like to put it behind us and
start over.

462
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:39,991
Uh, OK.

463
00:46:57,114 --> 00:46:58,081
(sigh)

464
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,260
Alright, I will see you later.

465
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:14,261
Alright. Hmmm.

466
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:41,083
Please, table for 2?. Ah yes, non-smoking. Thank
you.

467
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:49,061
Oh lordy (laughing) Dr. Wheeler, wow, hi. How
nice to see you.

468
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,801
So nice to see you. What a surprise.

469
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:54,096
Yea, I didn't know you left the office to eat.
(Laughing)

470
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,306
Well, you gotta eat sometime.

471
00:47:56,473 --> 00:47:59,101
(laughing) Yeah, oh, I'm sorry. This is Zach.

472
00:47:59,276 --> 00:48:01,210
Nice to meet you.

473
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:03,938
Cindy. Hi.

474
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:06,983
Oh maybe we should all dine together. Do you
guys mind?.

475
00:48:07,150 --> 00:48:08,139
That would be wonderful.

476
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,114
Oh great.

477
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:11,454
# I get tired, when nothing happens.

478
00:50:02,232 --> 00:50:04,666
I'm going to have to take it.

479
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,982
Oh there is just one more stop we have to make.

480
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,315
OK

481
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,751
Nice?.

482
00:51:05,128 --> 00:51:06,755
Yea,

483
00:51:08,465 --> 00:51:11,628
An upgrade, you've earned it.

484
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:23,275
Oh my God, Oh my God! OK

485
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:44,233
Ahhhh, ahhhhh, ahhhh. Hell no. What is this?.

486
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,028
What does it look like?.

487
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:48,701
When did you get a BMW?.

488
00:51:49,072 --> 00:51:51,506
It's a company car, it's just an upgrade.

489
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,108
But I thought you were quitting.

490
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:56,202
Yea, I thought you were quitting.

491
00:51:57,414 --> 00:52:00,042
Oh yea, Zach's here.

492
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,609
Oh shoot. The coffee shop.

493
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:07,256
The coffee shop.

494
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:18,834
Forgive me.

495
00:52:21,805 --> 00:52:27,266
Jacqueline called, she wants you at the
manager's meeting in Lake Geneva next week.

496
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:37,779
Must be nice to be the queen bee on the radar
screen.

497
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:57,229
# Shivering as I enter the dark days of winter.

498
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:11,210
Sweetie, I'll be home next week. I promise. Give
your brother a hug for me.

499
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:17,825
You need to be a big boy and stop crying. Stop it!
Stop crying!

500
00:53:18,495 --> 00:53:25,298
Put Daddy on the phone, Put Daddy on the
phone! (sigh)

501
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,748
I didn't know you had kids.

502
00:54:03,607 --> 00:54:08,271
Not until you're my boss. Good night Dan.

503
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:21,589
(beep, beep, beep ring, ring)

504
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:30,196
(Ring, ring, ring)

505
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:50,709
# And it's so cold outside.

506
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,824
You've been getting quite a few kitchen passes
lately.

507
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,790
Kiss my ass.

508
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:00,623
So how are things with the little lady?.

509
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,492
Been a little busy.

510
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,396
Ah, she dumped you.

511
00:55:18,715 --> 00:55:21,240
Ok, thank you so much.

512
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:22,908
I'll talk to you next week.

513
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:26,016
Yea, I'll give you a call. They were beautiful. Bye.

514
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:29,924
Hey stranger.

515
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:32,921
Hi.

516
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,264
Who's your friend?.

517
00:55:35,432 --> 00:55:40,267
Just a realtor, I'm just sort of window shopping.

518
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:41,802
Can I see?.

519
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:47,939
It's nice.

520
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:54,475
I can't really take it. Sorry.

521
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:00,653
You know what the date is?.

522
00:56:00,824 --> 00:56:03,850
Oh, October 27th.

523
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:08,020
It's exactly 6 months from when we met.

524
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:18,572
I can tell you're busy.

525
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:22,069
I'll see you later, OK?.

526
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,821
(sigh)

527
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,395
(sigh)

528
00:57:07,891 --> 00:57:10,086
(sigh)

529
00:57:14,931 --> 00:57:16,523
If you'll look here at the graph on the right,

530
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,530
you'll notice a definite increase in efficacy.

531
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:21,463
And that efficacy extended over the following nine
months.

532
00:57:21,638 --> 00:57:25,472
So can I have your guarantee that your next 20
prescriptions will be of Festril?.

533
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:26,571
OK

534
00:57:26,743 --> 00:57:27,471
Fabulous.

535
00:57:27,644 --> 00:57:28,702
I'm convinced.

536
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:29,902
You can keep the pen.

537
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,774
Thank you. Do you have any hats?.

538
00:57:31,948 --> 00:57:33,074
Well, I can get you some.

539
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:49,091
Hi.

540
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,124
Hi.

541
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:56,931
What do say we go out tonight, have a quiet
dinner?.

542
00:57:58,675 --> 00:58:02,805
I would love to, but I have to work. I have a
dinner program.

543
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:09,008
What if I came with you?.

544
00:58:09,786 --> 00:58:11,447
I don't think you really want to.

545
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,715
Aren't the doctors bringing their spouses?.

546
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:16,859
Yea, but.

547
00:58:18,561 --> 00:58:21,621
OK

548
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:28,426
You guys are just going to be amazed at the
benefits of this drug,

549
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:31,768
I mean really they have not found nothing better
on the market at this time.

550
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:34,774
The results have just been thrilling.

551
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:39,806
Nice job Karly.

552
00:58:39,983 --> 00:58:42,645
I'll second that.

553
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:46,120
You must be pretty proud of Karly.

554
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:52,052
She's definitely our best rep, I have never seen
anyone move market share like her.

555
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:56,096
Did she tell you that she was nominated for
"Industry Rep of the Year".

556
00:58:56,599 --> 00:59:02,902
The winner will be announced at the AAPC, the
top players from all the major companies will be
there.

557
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:09,543
The press. The top industry reps from all the
health care providers.

558
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:18,113
Mhmmm. If you will excuse me, I just have to run
to the ladies room.

559
00:59:18,988 --> 00:59:22,253
I'll join you.

560
00:59:28,531 --> 00:59:35,266
Even more importantly, did she tell you that she is
going to be bringing home some major bacon?.

561
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:40,700
Did she tell you that they have her on the
management track?.

562
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:55,884
Management track?.

563
00:59:56,059 --> 00:59:58,789
It's just talk.

564
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:07,859
So I am taking it that you did not enjoy yourself.

565
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,131
Can't say that I did.

566
01:00:15,578 --> 01:00:18,103
This whole scene.

567
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:21,114
You know, you asked to come,

568
01:00:21,284 --> 01:00:22,251
Yea

569
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:23,677
Yea

570
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,816
Because it was the only way I could get some
time with you.

571
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:36,793
Watching you tonight was a hard pill to swallow.

572
01:00:38,835 --> 01:00:40,803
I guess I thought we were on the same page.

573
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:43,905
And what page was that exactly?.

574
01:00:44,073 --> 01:00:49,602
You know if it weren't for this industry, who else
would research cures for diseases?.

575
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:54,614
Who else would invest the millions that it takes to
bring a new drug to market.

576
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:57,179
You know some day, you are going to be pretty
damn glad...

577
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:03,781
when some big BAD pharmaceutical company
was wiling to invest in a new treatment

578
01:01:04,627 --> 01:01:09,291
when it was you, or your Mom or your Dad who
has been hoping and praying,

579
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:13,693
that someone would give them hope during the
course of their disease.

580
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:22,775
Save the propaganda, I learned those lines
verbatim from pharmaceutical sales 1 01.

581
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:29,308
You don't get it do you?.

582
01:01:31,220 --> 01:01:34,621
Will the real Karly Hert please stand up?.

583
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:42,328
Which one am I talking to now?. I could not care
less about corporate America.

584
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:48,899
It's not the pharmaceutical industry I am
interested in spending the rest of my life with.

585
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:56,673
Decent people they don't push dangerous
medicines into other people's bodies.

586
01:01:56,846 --> 01:01:58,643
Dangerous medicines?.

587
01:01:58,815 --> 01:02:01,978
Like your Vivexx.

588
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,317
There is plenty good reading on the Internet Karly.

589
01:02:05,688 --> 01:02:09,124
But you probably prefer to stick to the company's
literature.

590
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:36,340
(Crying)

591
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:46,529
If we are going to have a successful launch of
Viivexx,

592
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:49,692
If we are going to have a successful launch of
Viivexx,

593
01:02:49,866 --> 01:02:53,859
it has to be on 75%% of HMO formularies prior to
launch.

594
01:02:54,036 --> 01:03:01,033
Successful launch?. Are you kidding me?. This is
slated to be the biggest drug launch of the 21 st
century.

595
01:03:01,210 --> 01:03:03,906
Viivexx is going to make Prozac look like penny
candy.

596
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:10,280
This drug is so superior in efficacy that any HMO
that doesn't pay for it can be sued for negligence.

597
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:15,082
What do you think Karly?. Can you sell this drug
without formulary coverage?.

598
01:03:15,258 --> 01:03:16,725
(clears throat)

599
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:21,086
Not so fast, there is something that we need to
discuss.

600
01:03:29,772 --> 01:03:31,763
What the hell is this?.

601
01:03:32,108 --> 01:03:36,238
A few case reports. There seem to be a few liver
issues popping up.

602
01:03:36,779 --> 01:03:39,009
Not on my watch, Not Viivexx.

603
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,179
Take a look.

604
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:58,094
Arghh, deaths?.

605
01:03:58,467 --> 01:03:59,434
Three.

606
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:04,873
3 deaths out of 1 400 patients studied, it could
have been any number of things.

607
01:04:05,074 --> 01:04:11,445
3 healthy patients, no prior liver problems, no
alcohol, not taking any other meds.

608
01:04:11,881 --> 01:04:13,974
I don't buy it. What about the others?.

609
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:22,023
All showed signs of elevated enzymes upon
administration of Vivexx, all showed decreases
once the medication was stopped.

610
01:04:23,159 --> 01:04:25,024
Karly, could you please excuse us.

611
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:27,788
Yea. Of course.

612
01:04:43,846 --> 01:04:44,938
Shelve it.

613
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:45,944
What?.

614
01:04:46,082 --> 01:04:47,515
You heard me.

615
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:48,214
But,

616
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:49,817
Who knows?.

617
01:04:50,119 --> 01:04:54,988
The case reports are randomly distributed in the
US, one or two are bound to end up in the medical
journals.

618
01:04:55,157 --> 01:05:01,289
One or two case reports are not going to alert the
press and maybe not even the FDA.

619
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:11,834
3 billion in its first year, millions of people having a
significant benefit from this drug.

620
01:05:13,242 --> 01:05:21,047
I am not going to let a few miscellaneous case
reports stop or slow the launch of this drug.

621
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,947
That is not for you to decide.

622
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,588
Again, who knows?.

623
01:05:30,026 --> 01:05:31,994
(toilet flush)

624
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:39,424
Karly?. Girl, I feel 1 0 pounds lighter.

625
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,434
Why so glum, chum?.

626
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,437
I'm just tired.

627
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:50,204
You better wake up, 'cause we have a party to
catch.

628
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:56,576
I really can't believe that they let you bring a guest
on this trip.

629
01:05:56,919 --> 01:06:01,185
There is a lot that is hard to believe.

630
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:26,682
You've reached the voicemail of Zach Danner,
please leave a message...

631
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:30,345
You've reached the voicemail of Zach Danner,
please leave a message...

632
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:35,116
Hey girl. You up for a drink at the bar?.

633
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:39,161
No, I am not up for a drink at the bar.

634
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,992
What's the hell is wrong with you?.

635
01:06:41,163 --> 01:06:42,130
Nothing.

636
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,290
Well, you're just a barrel of laughs to be around
these days.

637
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:46,929
Well Fuck you! You don't know jack shit.

638
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:53,531
You think everything has to be so God damned
much fun. Reality isn't the rosey world you live in
Grace.

639
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:55,267
Oh here we go.

640
01:06:55,444 --> 01:07:00,643
Quick somebody grab the violins because Karly
wants to sing that sad old song about rotten
Daddy.

641
01:07:07,456 --> 01:07:17,661
Look, I have always been proud of you, in spite of
everything. But lately girl, I don't even know you.

642
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:24,738
If you're not careful you are going to end up with
exactly what you are running from.

643
01:07:25,307 --> 01:07:27,605
There's a woman speaking from experience.

644
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:33,613
Everything was just peachy at fucking Grace's
house, I should know, I spent half of my life there.

645
01:07:37,753 --> 01:07:41,189
Oh Grace. I'm sorry, Grace, I'm so sorry.

646
01:07:41,357 --> 01:07:54,202
I'm losing it, I can't think. I don't know who I am
anymore, I'm so tired. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

647
01:07:55,404 --> 01:08:06,508
It's ok. It's ok.

648
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:16,647
#

649
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:23,027
(voice over) This liver stuff is just random pieces
of information.

650
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:28,603
(voice over) All talking about this will do is scare
people off from using the most effective drug
available.

651
01:08:29,305 --> 01:08:31,466
(voice over) I need you to keep what you heard
today to yourself.

652
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:35,440
(voice over) All direction to sales reps will be to
not initiate any discussion.

653
01:08:35,611 --> 01:08:40,480
(voice over) There is to be no discussion between
the reps and the physicians on this topic.

654
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:43,584
(voice over) The possibilities are limitless for a rep
like you.

655
01:08:43,752 --> 01:08:47,586
(voice over) You've worked so hard for this, you're
so close.

656
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:52,193
(voice over) Do you know how much money you,
personally, have the potential to make with this
drug?.

657
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:58,766
(voice over) Have I made myself clear?. You've
worked so hard for this.

658
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:05,062
(voice over) I'd hate to see you fall of the ladder
before you reach the final rung.

659
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:14,248
(voice over) Have I made myself clear?. There is
to be no discussion between the reps and the
physicians on this topic.

660
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:17,749
(voice over) Think about it.

661
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,088
(screech)

662
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:23,457
Medical services please.

663
01:09:23,726 --> 01:09:25,159
Are you a physician?.

664
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,157
Yes.

665
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:28,363
Name please?.

666
01:09:28,531 --> 01:09:30,362
Dr. Joyce Briggs.

667
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,364
Address?.

668
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:36,596
Um, 201 Williams St., Madison, Wisconsin.

669
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:39,536
One moment please.

670
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,541
Transferring you now to medical services.

671
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,110
(ring)

672
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:45,679
Medical Services, may I help you?.

673
01:09:45,848 --> 01:09:50,649
Yes, I was one of the psychiatrists who received a
preliminary sample of Vivexx to try.

674
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:55,620
I was wondering if there were any concerns with
this drug in relation to liver issues.

675
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,423
One moment please.

676
01:10:00,629 --> 01:10:05,794
The package insert contains no precautions,
warnings or contraindications in this area.

677
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:08,466
It should not be an issue in your patients.

678
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:11,601
But wasn't there a case report that said...

679
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:17,144
The case report that was published was not
conclusive. There was no way to rule out other
factors.

680
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:20,680
As you know this is a very difficult patient
population to gauge.

681
01:10:21,417 --> 01:10:25,581
We are not recommending any additional liver
monitoring.

682
01:10:25,754 --> 01:10:28,314
Thank you.

683
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:11,399
(Knock, knock, knock)

684
01:11:11,567 --> 01:11:13,569
Come in.

685
01:11:13,569 --> 01:11:17,733
Dr. Feinstein, I'm Karly Hert from Braden-
Andrews.

686
01:11:30,653 --> 01:11:32,587
Wow.

687
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:33,881
Huh?.

688
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:38,850
I never would've thought that Braden-Andrews
would send a rep to talk to me again.

689
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,928
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

690
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:44,794
Let's just say that I have fallen out of favor with
the one who sends your paycheck.

691
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,228
How so?.

692
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:47,733
Why are you here?.

693
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:54,739
Vivexx is gearing up to launch and I thought since
you were involved in some of the research...

694
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,936
I guess I just thought you would be a good
starting point.

695
01:11:58,347 --> 01:12:03,011
Ah yes, the golden cow, Viivexx. (chuckling)

696
01:12:05,054 --> 01:12:08,319
If you are here to try and convince me to use it,
you're wasting your breath.

697
01:12:09,024 --> 01:12:12,687
Why wasn't your name listed as one of the
authors for the journal of psychiatry study?.

698
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,296
Why would it be?.

699
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:27,906
Because it was listed as one of the original
authors for the poster presentation at last year's
psychiatric association meeting.

700
01:12:28,477 --> 01:12:30,775
That is a very interesting thing for you to notice.

701
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:31,913
Why?.

702
01:12:32,448 --> 01:12:35,440
Did you take a look at the section on side effects
and safety?.

703
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:41,351
Yes. It mentioned some mild sedation and teeth
grinding.

704
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:45,717
It's more what that section does not say, than
what it does.

705
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:49,496
I don't understand.

706
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:56,036
I learned a very long time ago to be extremely
cautious about using new meds on patients, even
throughout the course of a study.

707
01:12:56,372 --> 01:13:01,833
Now, I decided as a precautionary note to monitor
liver enzymes in patients who began taking
Viivexx.

708
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:10,850
My site enrolled 11 2 patients, 26 of them
experienced significant elevation of the enzyme
upon taking Vivexx.

709
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,652
All 26 returned to normal readings upon
discontinuation.

710
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,792
Why isn't that information listed here?.

711
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:23,626
They conveniently found a way to disqualify my
site, therefore all my findings were thrown out.

712
01:13:24,700 --> 01:13:27,931
Ours was the only study site monitoring liver
function.

713
01:13:28,103 --> 01:13:33,632
Now the poster presentation at the AAPA was just
to show preliminary efficacy findings.

714
01:13:33,776 --> 01:13:37,940
By the time the study was published, I and my
data had been removed.

715
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:40,682
There were others.

716
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:42,814
Excuse me?.

717
01:13:43,385 --> 01:13:45,979
Would you be willing to help me with something?.

718
01:13:48,957 --> 01:13:50,925
Oh, I'm sorry.

719
01:14:03,071 --> 01:14:03,238
(voice over) You're one of us now! We're thinking
management. You need to reevaluate the way you
dress.

720
01:14:03,238 --> 01:14:10,508
(voice over) You're one of us now! We're thinking
management. You need to reevaluate the way you
dress.

721
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:14,810
(voice over) Are you on board here Karly?. You
will notice this is quite a conservative company.

722
01:14:36,438 --> 01:14:38,736
I'm going to have to reschedule with Dr. Jones.

723
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:41,671
No problem, just let me check the schedule.

724
01:14:41,844 --> 01:14:43,903
I'm ready for you now Karly.

725
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,539
Oh God, I can't.

726
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:52,451
What the hell?.

727
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:07,762
Oh God Dammit! (Screaming!!!!)

728
01:15:53,181 --> 01:15:54,671
(Knock, knock, knock)

729
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,943
Hello Dr. Sweeney, mind if I ask you a few
questions?.

730
01:15:57,119 --> 01:15:59,246
Absolutely, come on in.

731
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,715
So what would you say your opinion is of
pharmaceutical sales representatives?.

732
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,222
I love the sales reps.

733
01:16:04,626 --> 01:16:07,857
I think they do a great job, they give me the
information I need fast.

734
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:12,865
I depend on them to give me facts regarding the
drugs they sell.

735
01:16:13,035 --> 01:16:15,799
And besides, there's nothing like a free lunch now
and then, is there?.

736
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:20,938
The healthcare sector made some significant
gains in the biotech and pharmaceutical markets.

737
01:16:21,109 --> 01:16:28,777
Braden-Andrews stock skyrocketed today, as they
received FDA approval for the much-anticipated,
anti-depressant Vivexx.

738
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:33,820
It is anticipated that Vivexx may be the
blockbluster of the century.

739
01:16:33,956 --> 01:16:38,950
In other business news today Wall Street is
braced for this quarters report on consumer
confidence.

740
01:16:39,127 --> 01:16:41,960
Analysts project a dip indicated by early holiday
shopping...

741
01:16:45,300 --> 01:16:48,098
Dobson, Sally Dobson.

742
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:09,746
# Can't be seen. Can't be heard. Is this a
dream?.

743
01:18:35,343 --> 01:18:41,145
What's the matter sweetie?. This is a big night for
you.

744
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:49,656
You know you can tell me anything.

745
01:18:52,194 --> 01:18:53,422
It's probably nothing.

746
01:18:53,795 --> 01:19:01,031
But I was just wondering what your take was on
some of the liver issues with Vivexx?.

747
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:19,216
I have no take, because there is no issue.

748
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:24,950
You're right. It's just that everything has been
happening so fast.

749
01:19:25,927 --> 01:19:27,724
You're right.

750
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:36,335
Good. Now let's go have some fun.

751
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,013
To Vivexx!

752
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,055
To Vivexx.

753
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:09,461
Well folks, it's that time in of the evening to honor
our industry's "Rep of the Year".

754
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:15,743
Each year we present this award to the
pharmaceutical representative who has had...

755
01:20:15,911 --> 01:20:20,746
...the greatest impact educating physicians and
thereby improving patient quality of life.

756
01:20:20,916 --> 01:20:27,185
Each company nominates one representative who
exemplifies these outstanding qualities.

757
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:31,381
Please join me in a round of applause, as I invite
Peter Anderson...

758
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:36,156
President of Braden-Andrews, to introduce this
year's winner.

759
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:37,331
Peter?.

760
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:39,760
(applause)

761
01:20:39,968 --> 01:20:41,765
Thanks, Mike.

762
01:20:41,937 --> 01:20:42,604
(applause)

763
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:44,333
(applause)

764
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:47,100
This year, it is my honor to present this award to a
rep...

765
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:53,111
who exemplifies everything that our company
stands for.

766
01:20:53,281 --> 01:21:00,119
She is hard working, intelligent, and did I mention
that this kid can move market share?.

767
01:21:00,288 --> 01:21:01,255
(Laughter)

768
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:09,090
But most importantly, her #1 goal is the same as
our own: to protect and prolong human life.

769
01:21:11,132 --> 01:21:14,431
Karly Hert, it is my honor to present to you this
year's

770
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:18,562
Pharmaceutical Industry Rep of the Year Award.

771
01:21:18,940 --> 01:21:23,377
(applause)

772
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:46,464
See, my Reps are good.

773
01:21:46,868 --> 01:21:48,836
(applause)

774
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:59,971
(heartbeat) dum dum, dum dum

775
01:22:00,148 --> 01:22:02,378
Thank you.

776
01:22:22,337 --> 01:22:34,511
Thank you.

777
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:42,485
Many people have asked me what my secret is.

778
01:22:42,657 --> 01:22:45,888
How can you have that kind of relationship with
physicians?.

779
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:49,622
How can you move that kind of market share?.

780
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:53,259
The answer is simple, really.

781
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:56,270
Honesty.

782
01:22:56,538 --> 01:23:01,635
Honesty with physicians, staff,

783
01:23:04,145 --> 01:23:06,511
and myself.

784
01:23:23,665 --> 01:23:29,194
Thus in the spirit of honesty and to live out the
Braden-Andrews creed...

785
01:23:29,371 --> 01:23:32,602
to protect and prolong human life.

786
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:35,602
I'd like to introduce someone.

787
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:41,073
Sally Dobson, would you please join me?.

788
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,077
Dobson.

789
01:24:11,646 --> 01:24:14,342
Thank you so much Karly,

790
01:24:14,516 --> 01:24:19,579
I want to share a story with everyone about one
drug that has significantly affected my life.

791
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:25,624
That drug was made by Braden-Andrews and
they call it Vivexx.

792
01:24:26,194 --> 01:24:30,358
Recently my husband went to the doctor for a
routine visit...

793
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:33,667
#

794
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:23,713
Within 24 hours, my husband was dead.

795
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:30,786
(gasps)

796
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:37,054
I wouldn't do that it if I were you.

797
01:25:47,342 --> 01:25:48,536
Hey Jacqueline...

798
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:19,596
# Don't look so surprised to see me, you never
wanted much.

799
01:26:34,222 --> 01:26:39,626
# I'm bigger now since you cut me down with
honesty, honesty. Honesty is so nice.

800
01:26:58,613 --> 01:27:00,376
And what about side effects?.

801
01:27:00,615 --> 01:27:05,552
Two words: feminine itching.

802
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:09,188
Just some mild explosive diarrhea.

803
01:27:09,457 --> 01:27:12,620
A little wind. (laughter)

804
01:27:13,194 --> 01:27:18,826
Only about 80%% of our patients experience sexual
disfunction...ing.

805
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:22,226
Sexual disfunctioning...Iy?.
