- [Narrator] The following dramatization

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,500
is inspired by an actual event.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,886
Composite and fictionalized
characters have been used.

(door banging)
(dramatic music)

7
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,643
- You failed.

8
00:01:54,667 --> 00:01:55,630
- Okay, good.

9
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,963
The island Napoleon was first exiled to?

10
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,313
- Oh, wait, I know that one.
- All right.

11
00:02:01,313 --> 00:02:03,692
- Um...
- Bum, bum, bum, bum.

12
00:02:03,692 --> 00:02:05,140

14
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,623
Roman god of war?

15
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,180
- Ares.
- Ares is a constellation.

16
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:12,993
I'm looking for a god.

17
00:02:14,194 --> 00:02:17,720
(imitates buzzer) Mars,
like the candy bar?

18
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,970
Maybe you've heard of it?

19
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,853
We are in trouble here, kiddies.

20
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:26,090
I know you guys got a lot on your minds.

21
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:27,800
Date to the big dance.

22
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,013
Football game, winter break.

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,520
But next Monday, we gotta face the music.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,107
So, I suggest we suck it up,

25
00:02:36,107 --> 00:02:39,450
and we show everybody in
the world that nobody,

26
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,340
and I mean nobody

27
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,530
messes with Kenny Kroft's Johnson Jackals

28
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,822

(bell rings)
All right?

30
00:02:48,698 --> 00:02:50,215
(class applauds)
Nobody!

31
00:02:50,215 --> 00:02:51,606
Now get outta here.

32
00:02:51,606 --> 00:02:53,146
Wake up, now.

33
00:02:53,146 --> 00:02:54,281
Hey, hey, hey, hey,

34
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:55,510
I wanna see you all here tomorrow at two.

35
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,960
None of this senior ski day routine.

36
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,600
I'm stuck here,

37
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,603
you guys are stuck here, all right.

38
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,370
Stopping by.

39
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,930
Hey, Aaron.

40
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,039
Look,

41
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,190
you gonna bless us with
your presence, you know.

42
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:09,390
Girls won't participate.

43
00:03:11,707 --> 00:03:13,383
- I knew you knew those answers.

44
00:03:14,503 --> 00:03:15,873
- Then there's no problem.

45
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,683
Hasta manana, Mr. K.
- Yeah.

46
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,530
Okie dokie, Aaron.

47
00:03:28,359 --> 00:03:30,040
- [Mimi] Where you been all night?

48
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,280
Hand me my cigarettes.

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,736
- You don't need them.

50
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,290
You know what they told you.

51
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:36,540
(coughing)

52
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:40,563
- I don't need no advice from you, mister.

53
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:42,440
What I need

54
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,620
is for you to

55
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,630
start pulling your weight,
and get yourself another job,

56
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,960
'cause your rent is going up.

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,793
- What?

58
00:03:50,793 --> 00:03:51,626
My what?

59
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,187
Mom, I'm paying more than
my fair share already.

60
00:03:55,187 --> 00:03:57,437
(coughing)

61
00:03:58,852 --> 00:03:59,685
- Listen.

62
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,907
You are a grown man.

63
00:04:02,907 --> 00:04:05,591
I can't do this alone anymore.

64
00:04:05,591 --> 00:04:09,460
If I don't get my medical
premiums in on time this month,

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,710
Mr. E. Walsh is gonna cut me off flat.

66
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,397
And then what's gonna happen?

67
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,517
- Why you always asking me?

68
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:26,458
- (coughing) Where you going?

69
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:27,791
Where you going?

70
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:33,244

off my boy, off my boy.

93

- [TV Reporter] An 11-year-old girl

96
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,900
was the latest tragic casualty

97
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,530
of gang violence in Los Angeles today.

98
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,543
The child was asleep in her bed.

99
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:34,040
- I was watching that.
- Big city.

100
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,710
That's what you want.

101
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,843
Looks real beautiful.

102
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:40,829
- It doesn't have to be L.A.

103
00:06:40,829 --> 00:06:43,120
We live in a big country.

104
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,950
It could be any other city.

105
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,290
- Like where, San Francisco?
- That's a very pretty town.

106
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,640
- So a freeway can fall on
us during an earthquake?

107
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,260
Or how about your beloved New York,

108
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,810
so the girls can go to
school with metal detectors?

109
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,463
I grew up here, and I'm not leaving.

110
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:00,463
- You know?

111
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,210
Maybe they're right.

112
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:05,800
Maybe I wasn't cut out to be a cop.

113
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,940
I mean, I'm a podiatrist's
son, for god's sake.

114
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,800
I wasn't even able to have a BB gun.

115
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,633
You'll shoot yourself in the eye.

116
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:13,463
- I'm not laughing, Skip.
- Yeah, but you will.

117
00:07:13,463 --> 00:07:16,150
I want you to laugh, Margaret.

118
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,250
- My father is a great judge of character.

119
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,010
And he never would have hired you

120
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,420
if you weren't right for this job.

121
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,190
- Yeah, but unfortunately, your
father is no longer sheriff.

122
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,140
Unfortunately, he's not calling the shots.

123
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,960
And day after day after
day, I'm stuck in an office

124
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,180
with a bunch of rednecks
who think that your husband,

125
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,113
their father, is a joke.

126
00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:39,460
- All right, guys, sit
down, listen up, will ya.

127
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,950
We got today's hot list,

128
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:44,180
we got two OTL's on the hit parade.

129
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,530
We got Susan Dixon, juvenile runaway.

130
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,960
She's 14 years old--
- Let me guess.

131
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,271
Last seen in the company of her boyfriend.

132
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,500
(officers laugh)
- That's right.

133
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,707
Last seen in the company of
her boyfriend, thank you.

134
00:07:53,707 --> 00:07:55,440
See, it's not our job to comment.

135
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,930
We just go out, we find
her, we just bring her back,

136
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:58,320
so we can do it all again next week.

137
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,420
The Watkins Brothers out by Route 14

138
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,505
have been duking it out again.

139
00:08:01,505 --> 00:08:03,070
Let's see, Matt and Crawford,

140
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,730
you wanna stop by the
steakhouse along about noon

141
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,540
and talk to those boys, thank you.

142
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:09,330
Last and least, we got
the Johnson High School

143
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,033
homecoming dance tomorrow night.

144
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,580
Yeah, we need a babysitter to go out

145
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,440
and make sure that these esteemed scholars

146
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,070
don't drink themselves into oblivion,

147
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:19,030
and rearrange our telephone poles.

148
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,383
So, I took a drawing, and guess who won?

149
00:08:22,674 --> 00:08:26,422
- Skippy!
(officers applauding)

150
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,420
- Thank you everybody,
meeting's dismissed.

151
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,106
Have a good one.

152
00:08:32,106 --> 00:08:35,153
- We're counting on you, big guy. (laughs)

153
00:08:42,195 --> 00:08:47,195
(televisions playing)
(dramatic music)

154
00:09:13,877 --> 00:09:16,800
- Look, ma, don't forget
to pick me up after school.

155
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,970
There's a reading at the
college I wanna check out.

156
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,300
- Aaron, this is getting
to be a real drag.

157
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,523
I can't structure my days around
you, I have my own classes.

158
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,350
When are you gonna get your license?

159
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:28,096
It's been two years.

160
00:09:28,096 --> 00:09:31,628
I'm tired of playing chauffer.
- Fine, fine.

161
00:09:31,628 --> 00:09:33,120
I'll walk,

162
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,293
but, don't expect me to help
you with your homework anymore.

163
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,013
- You are so lucky I need you to pass.

164
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,170
Aww, Aaron, are you sure
you won't reconsider?

165
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,430
- Look, Ma, don't start.

166
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,250
- I got kicked outta high school

167
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:50,392
for wearing a granny dress and no bra.

168
00:09:50,392 --> 00:09:52,140
- Oh my god!
- I refused to shave my legs,

169
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,141
and I certainly wasn't gonna
go to any school dance, but,

170
00:09:55,141 --> 00:09:56,741
you know, sometimes I regret it.

171
00:09:58,157 --> 00:09:59,673
- I'll take my chances.

172
00:10:00,511 --> 00:10:02,760
Love you.
- Oh, honey.

173
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,177
(bell rings)

174
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:12,571
(students chatting)

175
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,650
- Sir,

176
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,180
howdy do?

177
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,430
- [Aaron] I don't think so.

178
00:10:20,503 --> 00:10:21,711
- [Girl] I got it.

179
00:10:21,711 --> 00:10:23,180
What about your brother?

180
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,100
- Are you serious?
- He's perfect.

181
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,210
He fills up the tux,

182
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,810
you do not have to be nice to him,

183
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:28,870
and you know he's not gonna attack you

184
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:29,710
at the end--
- Okay.

185
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,500
I'm not going to the homecoming dance

186
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,680
with my little brother. (giggles)

187
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,100
- Well, you're not staying home.

188
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,100
You're not giving them the satisfaction.

189
00:10:37,953 --> 00:10:40,030
- I couldn't care less
what they think, actually.

190
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,900
Hope they're happy together.

191
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,450
They're perfect for each other.

192
00:10:44,609 --> 00:10:48,293
Losers.
(dramatic music)

193
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,580
- [Girl] Who's car we taking?

194
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,500
- Yours.
- Yeah.

195
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,217
- Whoa, no wait, we can't take mine.

196
00:11:19,217 --> 00:11:20,530
(kids groan)

197
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,290
If they got my license plate
pulling out of the parking lot,

198
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,210
my parents would kill me.

199
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:25,390
They'd lock me in my room until I'm 47.

200
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:27,470
47, Sam.
- Uh huh.

201
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,240
Fine, we'll take my car for a change.

202
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,810
My dad knows I'm ditching anyway,

203
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:32,955
so.
- Whoa!

204
00:11:32,955 --> 00:11:34,910
Wait a second, you told your old man

205
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,460
that you're ditching
school, and he said okay.

206
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:38,730
- Yeah, after a two-hour argument.

207
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,838
- We're ready to go?

208
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:41,676
Who's car we taking?

209
00:11:41,676 --> 00:11:42,936
- I changed my mind.

210
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,275
It's too crowded.

211
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,108
- Know what?

212
00:11:45,108 --> 00:11:46,969
Think I changed my mind, too.
- Me too.

213
00:11:46,969 --> 00:11:48,219
- See ya.
- Bye!

214
00:11:51,453 --> 00:11:53,160
- Here you go, ladies.

215
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,770
Take all you need, but use all you take.

216
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,340
And remember what they say,

217
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,277
you're only cheating yourselves.

218
00:11:59,277 --> 00:12:01,340
- [Sam] I can't believe
I'm copying homework.

219
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,544
I'm not supposed to be here, anyway today.

220
00:12:03,544 --> 00:12:05,605
- [Boy] Oh, Kroft, Kroft.

221
00:12:05,605 --> 00:12:07,480
- Hi, Mr. Kroft.
- Jennifer.

222
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,880
- Good morning, Mr. Kroft.
- Let's take a walk.

223
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,443
Close the door.

224
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,660
Aaron,

225
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,520
I turn in my midterm grades
three weeks from today.

226
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,353
Have a seat.

227
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,300
Unless you do a major turnaround

228
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,210
the second half of the year,

229
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,510
you're not gonna graduate.

230
00:12:31,806 --> 00:12:33,830
- That's not a good thing, is it?

231
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,663
- No, it's not.

232
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:36,561
You know,

233
00:12:37,694 --> 00:12:40,983
when I was growing up, I had
this friend, Bobby Powell.

234
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:44,340
Best natural baseball player I ever saw.

235
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,140
Guy could roll out of bed,
stroke a double up the alley.

236
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:51,440
Never trained a day in his
life, never thought he had to.

237
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,030
You know what happened?

238
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:55,052
Everybody caught up
and finally passed him.

239
00:12:55,052 --> 00:12:57,610
(bell rings)

240
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,043
All that natural ability
right down the drain.

241
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:05,940
A wise ass attitude
and a handful of talent

242
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,453
only take you so far.

243
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:10,920
And if you refuse to do
your homework assignments,

244
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,470
you're not gonna get a diploma.

245
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:18,783
- It's just a piece of paper.

246
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:24,446
(dramatic music)

247
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:58,890
- So, I'll station myself
right here in the parking lot

248
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:00,330
that way I'll able to

249
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:02,400
intercept any child who
is thoughtful enough

250
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,000
to bring his own liquid refreshments.

251
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,300
Everything is under control.

252
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,600
- Principal Dresser's
out there with a deputy.

253
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:11,957
He must be getting serious
about kids cutting out.

254
00:14:11,957 --> 00:14:14,293
- [Teacher] Come give me
a hand with these beakers.

255
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,720
- [Aaron] Uh, hey, want
me to give you a hand?

256
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,790
- [Jimmy] Better let the master do it.

257
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,438
I'll take care of it.

258
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:22,131
- Thank you.

259
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:22,964
- I thought he took off.

260
00:14:22,964 --> 00:14:24,540
Did the cops ground him or something?

261
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,199
- Transportation problem,
nobody wanted to drive.

262
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,799
- [Teacher] Okay, class
open your books to page 118.

263
00:14:31,311 --> 00:14:34,485
(dramatic music)
(knocking on door)

264
00:14:34,485 --> 00:14:36,150
- [Mimi] Jason.

265
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:37,287
Jason?

266
00:14:37,287 --> 00:14:39,150
You can't hide in there forever.

267
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,209
I need you to ride up to the store

268
00:14:41,209 --> 00:14:44,020
to pick up my prescription.

269
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,064
- Yo, Mr. Substitute,

270
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:48,010
I don't know who gave you them wack notes,

271
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:50,530
but you better go check with
Principal Dresser or something,

272
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,790
'cause this is not Spanish.

273
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:53,465
This here is Chinese.

274
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,632
(yelling)

275
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:02,910
Your kung fu's good, but mine's better.

276
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,150
- Very funny.

277
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,590
I'm sure you have a bright future

278
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:07,530
as a standup comedian.

279
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,140
We've got 55 minutes together,

280
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,170
so let's not make this any
more painful than it has to be.

281
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:13,877
Everybody open your books.

282
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:15,157
- Okay, senor.

283
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,810
- [Jason Voiceover] Dear mom.

284
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,483
I want you to know that I don't blame you.

285
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,483
I'm sorry for acting mean sometimes.

286
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:34,663
I know you've always
done the best you could.

287
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,203
No matter what people tell you,

288
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,480
none of this is due to bad

289
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,160
parenting.

290
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,043
- Social uprising isn't just
a part of our distant past.

291
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,430
What about what happened in L.A.

292
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,023
after the Rodney King verdict?

293
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,973
Jennifer?

294
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:56,290
- I don't know if that was
a social uprising, I mean,

295
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,410
I bet that most of the
rioters didn't even know

296
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,760
who Rodney King was.

297
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,007
They were just using it as
an excuse to steal stuff.

298
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:04,871
- [Kroft] Okay.

299
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,621
(dramatic music)

300
00:16:24,237 --> 00:16:25,670
- [Jason Voiceover]
Sometimes the disappointment

301
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,163
is too much to take.

302
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:30,993
I love you.

303
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:34,925
(dramatic music)

304
00:16:53,461 --> 00:16:56,128
(siren blaring)

305
00:16:58,696 --> 00:17:00,770
- Hey, what about my cousin, Leo?

306
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,760
Maybe he'd drive up for the weekend.

307
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,190
- No. (laughs)

308
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,230
I'm not going.

309
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,920
Besides, he's not gonna
come all the way out here

310
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,753
just for me.

311
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,860
- What about Aaron Sullivan?

312
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,440
He's kinda cute.

313
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,367
In a weird way.

314
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,280
(giggling)

315
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,030
(dramatic music)

316
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:27,463
- [Jason Voiceover] Forgive me.

317
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:31,237
(dramatic music)

318
00:17:34,924 --> 00:17:36,122
- Excuse me.

319
00:17:36,122 --> 00:17:37,520
Hello.

320
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,570
- [Jason Voiceover] P.S., if I die today,

321
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,740
bury me someplace beautiful.

322
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:46,400
(dramatic music)

323
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,680
- And since there's injustice everywhere,

324
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,190
nowadays when it's so
tough on the streets,

325
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,150
you do it to me, and I'll do it to you.

326
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:55,820
Just like the Old Testament says,

327
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,480
and eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth.

328
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,900
- All right.
- Good stuff, huh?

329
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,670
- Powerful, intelligent, concise writing

330
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,690
from our boy, Travis.
- What, what? (laughing)

331
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,230
Y'all just jealous.

332
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:10,276
- [Teacher] Audrey, you're up, come on.

333
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:13,026
(dramatic music)

334
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,013
- I'm outta here.

335
00:18:24,013 --> 00:18:24,846
Watch this.

336
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,387
(speaking foreign language)

337
00:18:39,139 --> 00:18:40,643
(laughing) Oh man.

338
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:46,010
- Ladies and gentlemen,
in tonight's main event,

339
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,460
all the way from South
Central L.A., we have

340
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:53,530
the scrappy Have Nots taking
on the undisputed champion

341
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,530
Haves for all the marbles.
(imitating crowd cheering)

342
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:01,920
- Remember me?

343
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,683
- Dr. Livingston, I presume?
(class laughs)

344
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,620
- I'm supposed to go to Copper Lake

345
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,583
three times a week for night school.

346
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,890
(imitating buzzer)
- Answer is

347
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,690
what the hell are you talking about?

348
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,907
- I wonder who forgot their
homework in Mr. Harkin's class.

349
00:19:24,907 --> 00:19:28,240
(dramatic upbeat music)

350
00:19:31,832 --> 00:19:34,280
- Get back in your seats,
everybody just, just calm down.

351
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,683
Stay here.

352
00:19:35,683 --> 00:19:37,552
Stay here, I'll be right back.

353
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,885
(dramatic upbeat music)

354
00:19:41,911 --> 00:19:46,078
(kids screaming)
- What did he do?

355
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,689
- What's going on out here?

356
00:19:52,689 --> 00:19:57,689
(gun firing)

391
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,496
I want the teachers out of the building.

392
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:38,705

I'm gonna kill everyone.

Go.

(sirens blaring)

399
00:22:51,274 --> 00:22:52,320
- There's no other shooting?

400
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,790
- Why would someone do
something like this?

401
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,180
- Let's not worry about
why, let's worry about who.

402
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,050
- Miss Richard's just saw
a man entering the building

403
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,575
with weapons and guns all over him.

404
00:22:59,575 --> 00:23:01,300
- Hey, Eckert!

405
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,096
Eckert, come here.

406
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:05,538
I want you to look at a
teacher, Miss Richards.

407
00:23:05,538 --> 00:23:06,950
She had some contact with the gunman.

408
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,620
Mr. Dresser, why don't you go
with him and point her out.

409
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,453
- I know who she is.

410
00:23:09,453 --> 00:23:10,995
My daughter has her for English.

411
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:12,733
- Man, I'm sorry, I forgot.
- That's all right.

412
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:13,566
She's not here.

413
00:23:13,566 --> 00:23:15,310
I let her ditch to go skiing.

414
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:16,551
Had a big fight.

415
00:23:16,551 --> 00:23:18,256
I'll go find Miss Richards.

416
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:19,853
- Fine!

417
00:23:19,853 --> 00:23:21,686
Fine!
- Coming, coming.

418
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,413
- Look, gather together

419
00:23:25,413 --> 00:23:26,852
all the kids who were in
the building at the time,

420
00:23:26,852 --> 00:23:28,303
and take them someplace for debriefing.

421
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:30,510
- Where exactly?

422
00:23:31,721 --> 00:23:33,329
- You're a cop, for crying out loud.

423
00:23:33,329 --> 00:23:35,444
Figure it out.
- You can use the cafeteria.

424
00:23:35,444 --> 00:23:38,611
I'll show you where it is.
- Thank you.

425
00:23:40,547 --> 00:23:43,138
- All of you, get back, get back!

426
00:23:43,138 --> 00:23:44,263
Get back!

427
00:23:44,263 --> 00:23:45,182
Don't move!

428
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:46,015
Don't move!

429
00:23:46,015 --> 00:23:47,186
Sit down, sit down!

430
00:23:47,186 --> 00:23:48,797
Everybody, sit down!

431
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:50,353
All of you, sit down!

432
00:23:50,353 --> 00:23:51,482
Sit down!

433
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:52,945
- [Boy] Don't know, I
don't know what he wants

434
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,896
or who this guy is.
- Shut up!

435
00:23:54,896 --> 00:23:56,146
I said shut up!

436
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,430
You two, what's your names?

437
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:00,380
- Frankie.
- Willie.

438
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,490
- Move it, come on!

439
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:02,340
Get over here!

440
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,173
Come on!

441
00:24:04,367 --> 00:24:05,626
Come on!

442
00:24:05,626 --> 00:24:06,954
Come on!

443
00:24:06,954 --> 00:24:09,839
Get over there, get there,
get up, get over there!

444
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,760
Now listen, I want you
at the top of the stairs,

445
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,050
and I want you at the bottom.

446
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:14,560
Okay, and if you see some cops,

447
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:16,330
or you try to escape
and you don't tell me,

448
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:17,540
people are gonna die.

449
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,652
You hear me?
- Mm-hmm.

450
00:24:18,652 --> 00:24:19,706
- You hear me?
- Yes sir!

451
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,123
- Move it, move, move it now!

452
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,136
You tell them not to screw around!

453
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:25,969
I mean it!

454
00:24:25,969 --> 00:24:28,737
- [Willie] He's not screwing
around, they better get back.

455
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:36,272
- You tell them if I
see anybody with a gun,

456
00:24:36,272 --> 00:24:38,343
I'll start shooting people.

457
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,490
- He sees a gun, he's gonna kill people.

458
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:42,770
- If he sees any of you guys,

459
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,620
he's gonna light this whole place up.

460
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,873
- Copy that, over.

461
00:24:49,685 --> 00:24:51,183
He's got a room full of kids up there,

462
00:24:51,183 --> 00:24:52,530
and he's threatening to
blow up the building.

463
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,420
Ellis!

464
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,770
Cut the power of that wing.

465
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,820
- Gary, I spoke to Miss Richards.

466
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,390
She got a look, average this,
average that, nothing much.

467
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,070
- Who's our hostage negotiator?

468
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:03,070
Do we even have one?

469
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:04,743
- Yeah.

470
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:08,297
Yeah, I sent a guy to the
FBI course last summer.

471
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,069
- [Eckert] God help us.

472
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,877
- (crying) Where's my mother?

473
00:25:16,291 --> 00:25:17,708
I need my mother.

474
00:25:19,749 --> 00:25:21,760
- Jen, come on.

475
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,345
Come on, we gotta get outta here.

476
00:25:24,345 --> 00:25:27,178
(Jennifer crying)

477
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:34,455
(sirens blaring)

478
00:25:40,433 --> 00:25:41,833
- Okay, everybody listen up.

479
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:45,961
Now, sooner or later,
they're gonna come for us.

480
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:49,880
And when they do, just everybody
just cooperate with them.

481
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,713
Okay?

482
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:54,609
- [Girl] Why do you
think they're doing this?

483
00:25:54,609 --> 00:25:56,733
- Help, help!
- What's wrong, Jimmy?

484
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:00,035
- [Jimmy] I've fallen and I can't get up.

485
00:26:00,035 --> 00:26:02,452
(kids laugh)

486
00:26:04,809 --> 00:26:07,891
- He wants everybody to
come into the other room.

487
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:09,020
- [Kid] What?

488
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,960
- He says if you don't come now,

489
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,710
he's gonna kill five of my friends.

490
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:17,543
- Okay, um, everybody come on, let's go.

491
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,330
Remember, just like we talked about.

492
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:23,290
Everybody just, just
keep your mouths shut.

493
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,200
Come on, come on.
- Not you, Mr. Braddock.

494
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,920
- No, I'm not gonna let them--
- Please, he said no teachers.

495
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,881
- No--
- Mr. Braddock.

496
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:31,494
You said it yourself.

497
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:32,844
We better do what they say.

498
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:35,930
- [Willie] Hurry.

499
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:38,653
- Okay, uh,

500
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:43,270
just do what they say,
everything's gonna be--

501
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:46,236
- [Willie] He wants
everybody in a straight line.

502
00:26:46,236 --> 00:26:48,069
- [Mr. Braddock] Okay.

503
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:05,837
- [Officer] We got the south side.

504
00:27:05,837 --> 00:27:09,670
- [Officer] Can we get
some tear gas in there?

505
00:27:10,684 --> 00:27:12,870
- [Boy] It's okay, Jennifer.

506
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:13,703
Come on.

507
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,603
Come on, you gotta try, come on.

508
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,397
- I told you to shut up!

509
00:27:21,397 --> 00:27:22,230
Get in there.

510
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,063
Get in there, move it!

511
00:27:23,063 --> 00:27:24,532
Gimme that, let go of that.

512
00:27:24,532 --> 00:27:27,935
- Just do what he says.
- Get in there, go, go, go!

513
00:27:27,935 --> 00:27:29,246
Get over there.

514
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:30,629
Get in, get in, go!

515
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:31,462
Go!

516
00:27:31,462 --> 00:27:32,295
Go!

517
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:33,128
Go!

518
00:27:33,128 --> 00:27:34,128
Move it, go!

519
00:27:35,368 --> 00:27:36,585
Go!

520
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:38,526
Will you shut up?

521
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,443
I told you to be quiet.

522
00:27:43,588 --> 00:27:46,671
- [Aaron] Please, it's gonna be okay.

523
00:27:49,438 --> 00:27:51,844
(cymbal clangs)

524
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:53,298
- Don't!
- Hey, hey, easy!

525
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:55,056
- Don't, don't!
- Easy, easy.

526
00:27:55,056 --> 00:27:57,249
I wasn't trying anything.
- Get back!

527
00:27:57,249 --> 00:27:58,297
Sit down!

528
00:27:58,297 --> 00:28:00,002
Don't move!

529
00:28:00,002 --> 00:28:02,252
- I'll do whatever you say.

530
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:04,543
- Get down.

531
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:07,208
(dramatic music)

532
00:28:08,072 --> 00:28:11,979
You want me to make an example outta you?

533
00:28:11,979 --> 00:28:12,812
Sit down.

534
00:28:17,293 --> 00:28:20,043
You people better pay attention
to who's in charge now.

535
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:23,915
(dramatic music)

536
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,126
- [Officer] All right,
Charlie, I'm gonna go--

537
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:40,959
(people chatting)

538
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:46,861
- [Officer] Ellis, keep those people back.

539
00:28:46,861 --> 00:28:47,694
- My son.

540
00:28:47,694 --> 00:28:49,525
- Ma'am?
- My son goes to this school.

541
00:28:49,525 --> 00:28:51,431
- Just calm down.
- You know, you know my son.

542
00:28:51,431 --> 00:28:52,498
You know Travis.

543
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:53,990
Don't you know my son?

544
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:54,906
He...
- Calm down.

545
00:28:54,906 --> 00:28:55,906
- Oh my god.

546
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,321
Travis!
- Wait.

547
00:28:58,321 --> 00:29:01,071
(sirens blaring)

548
00:29:03,665 --> 00:29:05,288
- Richard?
- Where are you?

549
00:29:05,288 --> 00:29:06,388
- [Man] Ellie?

550
00:29:06,388 --> 00:29:08,638
- Where's my baby?
- Travis?

551
00:29:09,538 --> 00:29:10,589
Travis?

552
00:29:10,589 --> 00:29:12,806
(dramatic music)

553
00:29:12,806 --> 00:29:13,639
Travis?

554
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:15,592
Do you know my son?

555
00:29:15,592 --> 00:29:18,044
(people chatting)

556
00:29:18,044 --> 00:29:18,877
Travis?

557
00:29:18,877 --> 00:29:20,749
Do you know my--
- Make way.

558
00:29:20,749 --> 00:29:23,499
(dramatic music)

559
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,979
- [Girl] I need help.

560
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:31,192
- [Officer] Make way.

561
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:33,096
- Richard!
- Wanna talk with you.

562
00:29:33,096 --> 00:29:38,096
(dramatic music)
(people chatting)

563
00:29:59,206 --> 00:30:00,855
- Bring it in, bring it in!

564
00:30:00,855 --> 00:30:04,032
Set it down there, get back,
get back to the stairs.

565
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,050
Set it down right there on the desk.

566
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,114
Sit down.

567
00:30:07,114 --> 00:30:08,040
Sit down!

568
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,200
No, get back.

569
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,033
Go to the stairs!

570
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,473
You.

571
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,591
- Me?

572
00:30:27,591 --> 00:30:28,430
- You!

573
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:29,970
Yeah you, get up here.

574
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,830
Get up here, open it.

575
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,663
Open it.

576
00:30:36,583 --> 00:30:39,500
(suitcase beeping)

577
00:30:48,001 --> 00:30:48,834
Get it.

578
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,700
- Hello?

579
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:57,090
- Hello, I'm Skip Fine, I'm
from the Sheriff's department,

580
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,140
and who am I talking to?

581
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:00,520
- Aaron Sullivan.

582
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,560
- Hi Aaron, now listen.

583
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,720
I know you've got a problem up there,

584
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,500
and I'm here to help you.

585
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:07,290
So, if you just tell me
what it is you want--

586
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,623
- Keep an eye on those stairs!

587
00:31:08,623 --> 00:31:10,030
- [Skip] We can get it for
you, you can come on out,

588
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:12,463
and then we can let all
those kids go, okay?

589
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,870
- Uh, I think you got the wrong--

590
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,703
- Who is it?

591
00:31:16,703 --> 00:31:18,067
- [Aaron] I think you got the wrong guy.

592
00:31:18,067 --> 00:31:18,900
- What do they want?

593
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,743
- I'm, like, one of the prisoners.

594
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,823
- How long till the FBI gets here?

595
00:31:22,823 --> 00:31:24,900
- They promised less than 30 minutes.

596
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,066
- Well, they better hurry.
- Okay, now Aaron,

597
00:31:27,066 --> 00:31:27,990
could you do me a favor please?

598
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:29,380
Would you ask the gentleman with the gun

599
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:31,209
to please get on the phone--
- What do they want?

600
00:31:31,209 --> 00:31:33,160
- So I can speak to him directly?

601
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,993
- Oh, hold on.

602
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,513
It's for you.

603
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,423
It's the cops.

604
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:41,468
- Set it down.

605
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:43,051
Get back, get back.

606
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,482
What?
- Hi, this is Skip Fine.

607
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:50,363
I'm with the Sheriff's
Department, I'm a negotiator.

608
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:52,630
Who am I talking to?

609
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,540
- Never mind.
- I don't care

610
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,100
if it's your real name or not,

611
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,710
I just don't wanna feel
like I'm talking to the air,

612
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,543
you know?

613
00:31:59,614 --> 00:32:00,640
- He wants a name.

614
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,807
I need a name!
- Uh, George.

615
00:32:02,807 --> 00:32:05,224
(kids laugh)

616
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,030
- I'm George.

617
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,770
- Hi George.

618
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,090
My name is Skip.

619
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:14,930
I'm a negotiator with
the Sheriff's Department,

620
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,583
and I'm here to help you.

621
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:19,280
- Oh yeah, well, Mr. Kroft,
man, he wanted to help me too.

622
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,877
- Okay, and who is Mr. Kraft?
- Kroft.

623
00:32:23,164 --> 00:32:25,660
- Mr. Kroft, he tried to help me pass,

624
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,900
and then he flunked my ass
with one fricking grade.

625
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,959
Knocked everything down, all my dreams.

626
00:32:29,959 --> 00:32:32,770
- You know, it is very apparent to me

627
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:34,510
that this really upsets you.

628
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:35,747
- Upsets me, you're
damn right it upsets me.

629
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:36,983
It ruined my life.

630
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:42,159
I worked my ass off for those grades.

631
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,420
- This maniac had Kroft as a teacher.

632
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,260
So, pull the yearbooks,

633
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,440
and have the teacher who saw him

634
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,310
see if she can pick him out.

635
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,600
Okay?
- Got it.

636
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,537
- [Jason] Turned out that
paper was not in there,

637
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:52,577
and he says, "Buzz, you failed!"

638
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,333
What are you staring at?

639
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,980
- Okay, now look--
- And he wants me to go to

640
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:01,296
Copper's Lake tonight to
go three nights a week

641
00:33:01,296 --> 00:33:02,467
without a car?

642
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:05,076
I didn't have a car, man.

643
00:33:05,076 --> 00:33:07,770
I just got one.
- Okay, all right, but look.

644
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:09,860
Why don't we start fresh

645
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,220
right now.
- It's too late.

646
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,610
- It's not too late, George, come on.

647
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:15,126
Listen, we--
(dial tone rings)

648
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,876
(dramatic music)

649
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,930
- Come on, come on, keep looking.

650
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:47,330
Maybe something rang a bell.

651
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,380
- He couldn't have positioned
himself more strategically.

652
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,718
There's no way we could even think about

653
00:33:54,718 --> 00:33:57,704
before nightfall.
- What are you looking at?

654
00:33:57,704 --> 00:33:58,537
Huh?

655
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:02,970
You know me?

656
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,863
Did I have a class with
some of you people?

657
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,210
You morons, you weren't
even here when I was here.

658
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,860
Look at this garbage they force you to do.

659
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:16,360
It don't mean crap in the real world.

660
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,760
Who's room is this?

661
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,385
- Mrs. Yules.

662
00:34:19,385 --> 00:34:21,310
- Oh, that bitch.

663
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,070
She insulted my sister one time.

664
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:25,967
Even came to my house
and knocked on my door.

665
00:34:25,967 --> 00:34:27,393
"Beth Copeland here?

666
00:34:28,727 --> 00:34:30,247
"Beth Copeland here?"

667
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,220
- Last name,

668
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,053
Copeland.

669
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:36,522
- Jason.

670
00:34:36,522 --> 00:34:39,272
(dramatic music)

671
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:47,150
- [Girl] He's gonna kill us, he's crazy.

672
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,983
- No he's not.

673
00:34:47,983 --> 00:34:48,890
He's just trying to scare us.

674
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:51,003
- That doesn't mean anything for sure.

675
00:34:52,174 --> 00:34:53,302
- What was that?

676
00:34:53,302 --> 00:34:54,810
What was it, huh?

677
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,640
I heard somebody say something.

678
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,205
Now who was it?

679
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:01,452
(dramatic music)

680
00:35:01,452 --> 00:35:05,027
Was it you?

681
00:35:05,027 --> 00:35:06,270
- It was me.

682
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,103
I...

683
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:09,640
My friend's not feeling well,

684
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:12,580
and she needs to go to the bathroom.

685
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,780
- What's wrong with her?

686
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,750
- She's

687
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,583
pregnant.

688
00:35:20,898 --> 00:35:22,698
- What the hell you doing in school?

689
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,487
- Please?

690
00:35:27,487 --> 00:35:29,565
Can't you just let her go?

691
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:30,398
I mean,

692
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:32,617
it's just one person.

693
00:35:32,617 --> 00:35:35,390
(dramatic music)

694
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:37,613
- She doesn't get better
later, I'll send her down.

695
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:40,720
But if you're lying to me...

696
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,437
You can go to the bathroom.

697
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:48,627
But you got five minutes,
you understand me?

698
00:35:48,627 --> 00:35:50,310
And if you don't come back,

699
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:53,730
or you're late, you're gonna
kill some of your friends.

700
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:54,563
Frankie!

701
00:35:54,563 --> 00:35:56,926
Keep an eye on her, she's
going to the bathroom.

702
00:35:56,926 --> 00:35:59,676
(dramatic music)

703
00:36:01,969 --> 00:36:06,969
She's got two minutes.
(dramatic music)

704
00:36:18,039 --> 00:36:20,021
- [Officers] Come with
us, let's go, this way.

705
00:36:20,021 --> 00:36:21,011
This way.

706
00:36:21,011 --> 00:36:23,121
- [Jason] What the hell is that?

707
00:36:23,121 --> 00:36:25,292
Frankie, I hear something.

708
00:36:25,292 --> 00:36:28,126
Get up here, or I'm gonna shoot somebody!

709
00:36:28,126 --> 00:36:30,154
(dramatic music)

710
00:36:30,154 --> 00:36:32,915
- Just keep going.
- Hold it, I can't.

711
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:35,268
- Watch your step.
- He's gonna kill everybody!

712
00:36:35,268 --> 00:36:36,398
- [Officer] That's it!

713
00:36:36,398 --> 00:36:37,681
- Let me go!
- Here you go.

714
00:36:37,681 --> 00:36:40,839
- I let her go to the fricking
bathroom, and what happens?

715
00:36:40,839 --> 00:36:43,455
What did I say was gonna
happen if she didn't come back?

716
00:36:43,455 --> 00:36:48,288
(gun fires)
(kids scream)

717
00:36:54,063 --> 00:36:57,538
(phone beeps)
(dramatic music)

718
00:36:57,538 --> 00:37:00,080
- [Boy] It's the law.

719
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,913
- Get it.

720
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:09,640
- Hello?

721
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,473
- Uh, George.

722
00:37:10,473 --> 00:37:12,350
- This is Aaron.
- Aaron, Aaron,

723
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:13,793
is everything all right?

724
00:37:13,793 --> 00:37:15,743
Is everything okay up there?

725
00:37:20,541 --> 00:37:21,817
- He shot the clock.

726
00:37:21,817 --> 00:37:24,063
- He shot the clock,
okay, he shot the clock.

727
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,060
- How'd they get so close, huh?

728
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,253
You were supposed to be watching them.

729
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:30,490
- What was I supposed to do?

730
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,360
They just came up and got her.
- Don't screw with me Frankie.

731
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,260
You, get downstairs, go!

732
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,379
Run!

733
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,629
Get over there and watch.

734
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,230
- Now, listen, uh, Aaron, tell me this.

735
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,593
Without letting him know are there more

736
00:37:46,593 --> 00:37:48,537
than 10 people in that room with you?

737
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:51,654
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

738
00:37:51,654 --> 00:37:53,480
Are there more than 20?

739
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,380
Aaron, are there more than 20
people in the room with you?

740
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,980
Is he standing very, very close to you?

741
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,930
- What's he saying?

742
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,773
- They wanna know where you're standing?

743
00:38:06,773 --> 00:38:09,090
- You tell them I'm right in
front of a room full of people

744
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:10,593
with a loaded shotgun.

745
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,070
- Aaron?

746
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,370
Aaron, now please listen to me, never

747
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,870
never tell him what I'm telling you, okay?

748
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,843
Lie to him if you have to, okay?

749
00:38:20,891 --> 00:38:22,191
I can't do this by myself.

750
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,990
We're gonna become a team now, okay?

751
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:28,190
- You listen to me, man.

752
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:30,040
I'm gonna start sending
them down in pieces,

753
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,373
and it's your fault.

754
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,780
- Now, just give me a second.

755
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:37,031
Just explain to me what it is that I--

756
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,481
(dial tone rings)
- You keep this under control.

757
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,277
- I'm gonna write that down.

758
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,570
(dramatic music)

759
00:39:02,845 --> 00:39:05,595
(sirens blaring)

760
00:39:07,134 --> 00:39:09,835
- [Officer] Anyone over here?

761
00:39:09,835 --> 00:39:12,668
(people chatting)

762
00:39:13,913 --> 00:39:15,395
- Hey, hey.
- Listen, listen,

763
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:17,002
I wanna talk to everybody all at once.

764
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:19,400
Listen to me, I'm gonna talk
to everybody all at one time.

765
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,790
Listen, if you can just
let me through now.

766
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:22,237
I'm gonna talk to everybody.
- Where's my son?

767
00:39:22,237 --> 00:39:24,163
- Just give me a second.

768
00:39:24,163 --> 00:39:25,520
Now, listen every...

769
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,370
Dammit.

770
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,060
Listen, if you all just
please settle down.

771
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,900
- What is going on?

772
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,080
Please?

773
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,450
I just wanna see my son.

774
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,150
- We have a trained negotiator
who is talking to the gunman,

775
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,220
and we have every reason to believe

776
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,511
that this thing is gonna
be settled shortly.

777
00:39:41,511 --> 00:39:43,040
- Very shortly?
- Shortly?

778
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,850
- Very soon, but we don't know.

779
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,990
It depends.

780
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,806
- [Officer] I'm gonna need
a little bit of help, okay?

781
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:49,260
- A lot of us didn't
do well in high school.

782
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,380
Let me tell you, I'm for one, you know.

783
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,453
I can't even spell.

784
00:39:54,451 --> 00:39:55,901
- [Jason] It ain't just that.

785
00:39:56,766 --> 00:39:58,433
It's the other disappointments.

786
00:39:59,990 --> 00:40:01,930
- But then, George, let's
not make another one.

787
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:05,280
You know, there is still
time to end this peacefully.

788
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,253
And no one else has to get hurt.

789
00:40:08,293 --> 00:40:10,253
- (crying) Oh yeah, right.

790
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,080
The minute I walk through that door,

791
00:40:14,533 --> 00:40:17,844
you guys wanna shoot me down like a dog.

792
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:21,460
- Nobody is gonna do anything
of the kind while I'm here.

793
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,320
I mean, no one has died yet, George.

794
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,970
Don't you wanna keep it that way?

795
00:40:26,652 --> 00:40:27,972
- What?

796
00:40:27,972 --> 00:40:31,070
(dramatic music)

797
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,853
- I said no one has died yet.

798
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,083
- Kroft.

799
00:40:38,234 --> 00:40:39,793
I shot him up close.

800
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:43,421
- Yeah, you did, but he's gonna make it.

801
00:40:43,421 --> 00:40:46,171
(dramatic music)

802
00:40:55,947 --> 00:40:58,653
- I made a point, right?

803
00:40:58,653 --> 00:40:59,743
I mean, I taught him.

804
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,100
- You certainly made a point.

805
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:06,010
But why don't you just tell
me what is it that you want?

806
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,453
What are you thinking about?

807
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,630
(object clatters)
- What's that noise?

808
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:12,740
I heard something?
- George,

809
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,040
we will check it from down here.

810
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,564
I will send one of my guys--
- Frankie, come here!

811
00:41:16,564 --> 00:41:18,190
Go check it out, man.

812
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:19,532
Don't lie to me.
- All right.

813
00:41:19,532 --> 00:41:20,658
- Go!
- Okay.

814
00:41:20,658 --> 00:41:23,408
(dramatic music)

815
00:41:46,346 --> 00:41:47,403
Please,

816
00:41:47,403 --> 00:41:48,403
don't shoot.

817
00:41:49,307 --> 00:41:50,474
I'm a student.

818
00:41:51,939 --> 00:41:53,106
I'm coming in.

819
00:41:57,538 --> 00:41:59,424
- Oh my god.
- What's going on?

820
00:41:59,424 --> 00:42:00,941
What's going on?

821
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:04,439
(everyone talking at once)

822
00:42:04,439 --> 00:42:06,104
- Who's down there, Frankie?

823
00:42:06,104 --> 00:42:07,915
Are you talking to someone?

824
00:42:07,915 --> 00:42:10,453
Listen, you better bring them
back by the count of three.

825
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:14,485
I'm gonna kill someone.

826
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:16,185
One!
(cocks gun)

827
00:42:16,185 --> 00:42:18,009
- Oh my god!
- Two!

828
00:42:18,009 --> 00:42:19,737
- Don't, don't shoot!

829
00:42:19,737 --> 00:42:21,045
I found him!

830
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:22,268
We're coming out.

831
00:42:22,268 --> 00:42:25,018
(dramatic music)

832
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,010
- Fine?

833
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:37,400
Brown, FBI.

834
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,810
He's an experienced negotiator.

835
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,333
- [Brown] Why don't I take a crack?

836
00:42:41,457 --> 00:42:42,290
- Be my guest.

837
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:46,152
His name is George.

838
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,250
- We have to make a move and soon

839
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:52,163
before he realizes there's
other people in that class.

840
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:53,470
- Can you get in there?

841
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,100
- We'll come down from the
roof, take out the window.

842
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,520
- He'll hear that.

843
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,108
- Maybe yes, maybe no.

844
00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:01,210
But the door to the room's closed.

845
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:03,440
If you can keep him busy on the phone--

846
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:04,733
- [Eckert] It's a crap shoot.

847
00:43:05,721 --> 00:43:06,953
- Let's rock and roll.

848
00:43:10,686 --> 00:43:13,436
(dramatic music)

849
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,902
- [Officer] You up there, Mike?

850
00:43:16,902 --> 00:43:17,889
Okay.

851
00:43:17,889 --> 00:43:20,348
(dramatic music)

852
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:23,045
- [Officer] Perimeter is secure.

853
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:28,045
(phone beeping)
(dramatic music)

854
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:31,590
- Hello George, my name is Kyle Brown.

855
00:43:31,590 --> 00:43:32,440
I'm with the FBI.

856
00:43:33,305 --> 00:43:34,780
I'd like to try to help you.

857
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,930
- Oh, yeah, right.

858
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:38,610
Now, suddenly everybody wants to help.

859
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:41,000
- George, if you'll
just work with me here,

860
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,523
I'm sure we can clear up
this whole misunderstanding.

861
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:45,040
- Listen, I'm warning you.

862
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:46,890
I don't want any FBI guys trying anything.

863
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,130
I know about you guys.

864
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,290
Don't screw with me.

865
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:52,040
- I absolutely will not.
- You better not

866
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,733
because I got a room full of kids with me.

867
00:43:53,733 --> 00:43:55,700
- Now, that sounds like a lot of people

868
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,197
for one man to watch.

869
00:43:57,197 --> 00:43:59,020
Why don't you send some of them out.

870
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,410
- Oh, so they can tell you where I'm at?

871
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:06,410
- George, everyone out here
is very, very concerned,

872
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:10,925
but no one will do
anything unless I say so.

873
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:13,675
(dramatic music)

874
00:44:16,102 --> 00:44:18,263
- [Girl] Who's that, who's that?

875
00:44:18,263 --> 00:44:19,963
- Back from the window.

876
00:44:19,963 --> 00:44:21,163
- I don't think so, man.

877
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:25,740
(knocking on window)
(dramatic music)

878
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:27,399
- George?

879
00:44:27,399 --> 00:44:29,357
- Don't move, don't move!

880
00:44:29,357 --> 00:44:32,107
(dramatic music)

881
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,446
- George, talk to me, George.

882
00:44:42,446 --> 00:44:45,196
(dramatic music)

883
00:44:53,636 --> 00:44:56,637
- [Officer] Get that
ladder around to the side.

884
00:44:56,637 --> 00:44:59,980
Roberts on three!
- Up there, Mike?

885
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,335
Okay.

886
00:45:01,335 --> 00:45:06,335
(helicopter blades whirring)
(people shouting)

887
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:09,489
- Hey.

888
00:45:09,489 --> 00:45:10,322
Hi.

889
00:45:10,322 --> 00:45:12,700
- Hi, how'd you get past the blockade?

890
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:13,855
- Who's gonna stop me.

891
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,310
- That's a stupid question.

892
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,110
- They told me you were
the contact to the gunman.

893
00:45:17,110 --> 00:45:19,806
- Yeah, but, the FBI got their gopher.

894
00:45:19,806 --> 00:45:22,380
- They have no right to
pull you out of there.

895
00:45:22,380 --> 00:45:24,800
- I didn't know what I was doing.

896
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,300
I couldn't live with

897
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,800
a room full of dead kids on my conscience.

898
00:45:30,253 --> 00:45:33,253
- [Woman] Come on, get a move on it.

899
00:45:36,690 --> 00:45:37,770
- Fine!

900
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:39,190
Fine, get in there.

901
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:40,340
He'll only talk to you.

902
00:45:45,903 --> 00:45:47,933
- You can do it.

903
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:49,266
You'll be great.

904
00:45:58,571 --> 00:46:00,164
- [Man] Let's go!

905
00:46:00,164 --> 00:46:01,703
- [Officer] Try to station this area here.

906
00:46:01,703 --> 00:46:03,779
- [Swat Leader] Okay, right.

907
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:08,271
- [Officer] Okay, I thought
you had him on this side here.

908
00:46:08,271 --> 00:46:09,866
Okay.

909
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:11,027
- You lied again, Frankie.

910
00:46:11,027 --> 00:46:13,270
You knew they were out there,
why didn't you tell me?

911
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,670
One more time, and that's it, all right?

912
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:16,600
Get the phone!

913
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,707
Get back to the stairs, go, go!

914
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:21,954
- [Skip] Hi.

915
00:46:21,954 --> 00:46:25,105
Who am I talking to?
- Charlie Brown, speaking.

916
00:46:25,105 --> 00:46:26,609
(people laugh)

917
00:46:26,609 --> 00:46:29,310
- No really, who's on the line?

918
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,060
- It's that other cop, the
one you wanted to talk to.

919
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,650
- Tell him I don't wanna hear
that FBI guy's voice again.

920
00:46:34,650 --> 00:46:37,250
- [Aaron] He doesn't wanna hear
that FBI guy's voice again.

921
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,420
- Ah, no problem.

922
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,890
- And tell him to turn on
the power and the heat.

923
00:46:39,890 --> 00:46:41,388
It's freezing in here.

924
00:46:41,388 --> 00:46:42,790
- And he wants you to turn
on the power and the heat.

925
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:45,771
- All right, power and heat.
- And some aspirin.

926
00:46:45,771 --> 00:46:47,278
- Aspirin.

927
00:46:47,278 --> 00:46:49,933
- Is that okay, 'cause I
have kind of a headache.

928
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,840
Yeah, and some aspirin.

929
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,230
- And, um,

930
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:56,143
some pizza?

931
00:46:57,593 --> 00:46:58,670
(kids groan)

932
00:46:58,670 --> 00:46:59,570
What?

933
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,203
Hostages always get pizza.

934
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:05,067
I've seen it in the movies.

935
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,755
- [Jason] I only got five bucks.

936
00:47:09,755 --> 00:47:12,798
- That's okay, the cops will pay for it.

937
00:47:12,798 --> 00:47:13,903
It's part of the rules.

938
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,946
- Who wants pizza?

939
00:47:16,946 --> 00:47:18,672
- I do.
- Yeah, I do, man.

940
00:47:18,672 --> 00:47:19,505
- [Girl] Me.

941
00:47:19,505 --> 00:47:21,128
- [Girl] Me too.

942
00:47:21,128 --> 00:47:23,842
- All right, but we all
gotta agree on a topping.

943
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,677
- [Kids] Pepperoni, vegetarian,
anchovies, pepperoni,

944
00:47:25,677 --> 00:47:26,974
Canadian bacon, black olives.

945
00:47:26,974 --> 00:47:27,807
- All right, give me the phone.

946
00:47:27,807 --> 00:47:28,640
- Extra garlic.
- Ham.

947
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:29,600
- Hey, listen up.

948
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,654
We want 15 extra large pepperoni pizzas

949
00:47:31,654 --> 00:47:34,900
and we want five six packs of
root beer and five of cola.

950
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,290
And we want a thing of aspirin.

951
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,280
And we want them here in 15 minutes.

952
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:41,043
(kids cheering)
- Okay, 15 minutes.

953
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:43,580
Okay.

954
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,593
Does anybody know the
number for the pizza?

955
00:47:45,593 --> 00:47:47,093
- That's his room, don't go in there.

956
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:48,933
No you don't have a right to be in here.

957
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,912
(upbeat music)

958
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:55,293
And he, just, oh, he, he
wouldn't do this thing, right?

959
00:47:55,293 --> 00:47:56,307
I mean, just, just yesterday,

960
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:59,321
there were kids in the back yard, and he,

961
00:47:59,321 --> 00:48:00,427
one of them had an air rifle.

962
00:48:00,427 --> 00:48:02,908
And he shot, he shot a bird,

963
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:03,890
and he,

964
00:48:03,890 --> 00:48:04,975
Dana, what for?

965
00:48:04,975 --> 00:48:06,015
He wouldn't,

966
00:48:06,015 --> 00:48:07,120
he wouldn't

967
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:07,953
do this.

968
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:09,650
And these, they're just targets.

969
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,730
He likes to go to the range.

970
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:12,200
He had four...

971
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,763
He cried when they're--
(crying)

972
00:48:14,763 --> 00:48:16,145
No, get outta here!

973
00:48:16,145 --> 00:48:17,395
Get outta here, all of you.

974
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,715
I don't want you in here.

975
00:48:18,715 --> 00:48:21,746
No, no, those are his, his secret books.

976
00:48:21,746 --> 00:48:24,755
(dramatic music)

977
00:48:24,755 --> 00:48:27,422
(Mimi coughing)

978
00:48:28,547 --> 00:48:30,317
- Miss Copeland.
- He likes to read.

979
00:48:30,317 --> 00:48:32,799
- We'd like you to take a
ride with us over to Johnson.

980
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:33,965
- No, I can't.

981
00:48:33,965 --> 00:48:36,795
I can't go, I can't. (crying)

982
00:48:36,795 --> 00:48:39,545
(dramatic music)

983
00:49:32,420 --> 00:49:33,963
- Anybody's a senior?

984
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,193
You're the only one?

985
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:42,630
Who's not gonna graduate?

986
00:49:42,630 --> 00:49:43,513
You're screwed.

987
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:45,413
Take it from me.

988
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:48,433
You can't get a job.

989
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,093
No job, no money.

990
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,033
No money, no nothing.

991
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:57,900
I had a good job,

992
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,955
240 bucks a week,

993
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:03,635
installing the microchips
in the computers.

994
00:50:03,635 --> 00:50:05,673
I mean, that's the most important part.

995
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:09,824
I mean, without the chip, there's nothing.

996
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,873
And then they canned me
'cause of no damn diploma.

997
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,590
I just gave you all A's.

998
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:37,257
(kids cheering)

999
00:50:45,036 --> 00:50:46,453
- Check this out.

1000
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:50,260
- [Woman] You got a call on line six.

1001
00:50:50,260 --> 00:50:52,008
- Well, that's great. (scoffs)

1002
00:50:52,008 --> 00:50:53,710
We got a room full of hostages

1003
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:55,980
who have no sense of their own mortality,

1004
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:59,580
and a suicidal gunman who
only wants to talk to a local.

1005
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,413
- You know, wait a minute.

1006
00:51:00,413 --> 00:51:02,210
I don't need a play-by-play.

1007
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:03,410
I didn't ask for this job.

1008
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,610
He wanted me on the
phone, okay, I'm so sorry.

1009
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:06,990
So, either grab an oar
and start to paddle,

1010
00:51:06,990 --> 00:51:08,430
or get out of the boat.

1011
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:09,800
- Wait a minute.

1012
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,330
We're all on the same side here.

1013
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:12,263
I'm here to help.

1014
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,190
- We're all waiting.

1015
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,020
Look, this kid absolutely wants to believe

1016
00:51:18,020 --> 00:51:19,020
that he hasn't killed anybody,

1017
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,660
and that's exactly what we should keep him

1018
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,260
and everybody else in that room believing.

1019
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,500
- Yes, but what about the families?

1020
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,370
I got them in the gym, we
need to tell them something.

1021
00:51:25,370 --> 00:51:26,453
It's not right.

1022
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:29,170
- Our responsibility is to the children

1023
00:51:29,170 --> 00:51:30,790
that are alive in that room.

1024
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,570
- Can't we pull the families aside

1025
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:34,110
so they don't mix with anyone?

1026
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,000
- What happens if they talk
to other family members

1027
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,700
who then in turn talk to the media?

1028
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:41,500
- What if it was one of your
kids up there in that room?

1029
00:51:43,847 --> 00:51:46,070
- Then my daughter would
still be lying there

1030
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,077
an hour from now.

1031
00:51:49,221 --> 00:51:51,932
(dramatic music)

1032
00:51:51,932 --> 00:51:53,170
- Okay.
- Okay.

1033
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,920
(dramatic music)

1034
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:17,473
- Gotta calm down, you're
gonna make yourself sick.

1035
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:21,757
- They've got my baby in there.

1036
00:52:21,757 --> 00:52:22,674
- Mine too.

1037
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:26,039
But,

1038
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,724
it's not gonna do any
good to get all worked up

1039
00:52:29,724 --> 00:52:31,564
until we know something.

1040
00:52:31,564 --> 00:52:32,397
- Okay.

1041
00:52:34,202 --> 00:52:36,448
- Aww.
- Okay. (crying)

1042
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:39,198
(dramatic music)

1043
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,660
- George?

1044
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:53,610
It's probably none of my business, but,

1045
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,060
well, I was just wondering.

1046
00:52:57,122 --> 00:52:58,980
You think maybe you're putting
a little too much importance

1047
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,403
on this diploma thing?

1048
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,620
- Oh yeah, smart guy?

1049
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,330
Try talking to me after
you've been beat up

1050
00:53:05,330 --> 00:53:06,677
in the real world awhile.

1051
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:09,480
- I'm probably gonna get the chance.

1052
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,800
My grade point average is so low,

1053
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,800
I have to bend over just to look for it.

1054
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,643
You know, there's, there's time.

1055
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,913
We're young.

1056
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:30,420
- [Jimmy] Hey, uh, can we go get the TV

1057
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,300
from Mr. Braddock's room?

1058
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,232
- Come on.
- Yeah.

1059
00:53:33,232 --> 00:53:35,108
Yeah, go, get it.

1060
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:36,840
- All right, cool.
- All right.

1061
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,770
- [Jason] We can watch
ourselves on the news.

1062
00:53:38,770 --> 00:53:41,257
- Tell Randall to cut the
cable to the building.

1063
00:53:42,132 --> 00:53:42,965
Are you kidding?

1064
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:44,570
It says right here in the manual.

1065
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:46,530
Here, isolate the subject
from the outside world.

1066
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,050
I don't want this kid
getting any information

1067
00:53:48,050 --> 00:53:49,150
that doesn't come from me.

1068
00:53:49,150 --> 00:53:50,763
Please move now.

1069
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:54,521
I don't know who's worse.

1070
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:03,040
- [Aaron] Your boyfriend's
not too bright, is he?

1071
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,927
- He's not my boyfriend.

1072
00:54:04,927 --> 00:54:06,760
- But, I always used to
see you guys together.

1073
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,363
- Yeah, well, ancient history.

1074
00:54:12,287 --> 00:54:13,870
(phone beeping)

1075
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,000
- [Jason] Get it.

1076
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:15,913
- I, I gotta go.

1077
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,666
It's for me.

1078
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:25,940
Hello?

1079
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:28,050
- Aaron, are you alone on this line?

1080
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,610
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1081
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,098
Now, without counting,

1082
00:54:31,098 --> 00:54:34,720
can you tell me how many people
are in the room with you?

1083
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,982
- [Jason] Are they screwing around?

1084
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:37,815
What are they saying?

1085
00:54:37,815 --> 00:54:38,648
- [Skip] Tell him that the pizza is here.

1086
00:54:38,648 --> 00:54:40,197
- [Aaron] They said the pizza's here.

1087
00:54:41,130 --> 00:54:43,050
- [Skip] And that we only have five pies

1088
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,399
and three six-packs of cola.

1089
00:54:45,399 --> 00:54:48,345
- But we ordered 15 pizzas.

1090
00:54:48,345 --> 00:54:49,733
- Are they screwing around?

1091
00:54:50,604 --> 00:54:52,540
- Look, they only got five pizzas,

1092
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:53,750
and they messed up on the root beer.

1093
00:54:53,750 --> 00:54:54,803
They only got cola.

1094
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:58,671
- Listen, I got a lot
of hungry people here,

1095
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,330
and that's not gonna be enough food.

1096
00:55:00,330 --> 00:55:02,190
- Hey, listen, George,
you know what it's like

1097
00:55:02,190 --> 00:55:04,190
to order pizza on a Friday afternoon.

1098
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:05,820
The rest will be along here shortly,

1099
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:07,370
you know, and if they're
not, hey, they're free.

1100
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:08,540
- It better be.

1101
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:10,247
Now listen, I'm gonna send some
of my people down to get it,

1102
00:55:10,247 --> 00:55:11,860
and you better not screw with them.

1103
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,963
- I wouldn't do that.

1104
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:15,290
Okay, now listen.

1105
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,950
You know, the thing is that
since all the food is not here,

1106
00:55:18,950 --> 00:55:21,370
and I know that you don't
want anybody to go hungry,

1107
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:22,540
you know what I was thinking?

1108
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,750
Why don't we send some
of the hostages out,

1109
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,660
that way you'll have
enough food for everybody.

1110
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,130
I know you don't want
anybody to go hungry.

1111
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,980
- Forget it, no way!

1112
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:32,020
- Tell him you want the pizzas first.

1113
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:33,070
I can hear the phone.

1114
00:55:34,351 --> 00:55:35,503
- I want the rest of the pizzas,

1115
00:55:35,503 --> 00:55:37,740
then we can talk about
the other stuff later.

1116
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:40,000
Oh, by the way, if you're
thinking about drugging the pizza,

1117
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,460
don't bother, I'm not eating any.

1118
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:42,600
- Uh, George, George,

1119
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,940
before you hang up, can I ask
him if they could call my mom

1120
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,433
and tell her I'm okay?

1121
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:48,840
She's probably all freaked out.

1122
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:51,653
- Go ahead, man.

1123
00:55:55,307 --> 00:55:58,020
- Hey, Skip, hi, it's Aaron again.

1124
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,970
Um, look I was wondering if
you could call my mom for me

1125
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,080
and tell her I'm okay?
- Okay, now the thing is

1126
00:56:03,080 --> 00:56:04,220
we've contacted her,

1127
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:05,890
she already knows.
- Her name's Peggy Sullivan,

1128
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:06,853
she's listed.

1129
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,020
Hold on, I'll ask.

1130
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,540
Uh, George,

1131
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:14,600
they wanna know if it'd
be all right with you, um,

1132
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,330
if we got some pens and paper,

1133
00:56:16,330 --> 00:56:18,490
and everyone wrote their
name and phone number down,

1134
00:56:18,490 --> 00:56:19,850
so they can contact all our parents

1135
00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:21,333
and tell them we're all all right.

1136
00:56:23,384 --> 00:56:26,134
(dramatic music)

1137
00:56:29,823 --> 00:56:33,225
- [Officer] Yeah, they're
coming, they're alone.

1138
00:56:33,225 --> 00:56:34,058
Get ready.

1139
00:56:37,382 --> 00:56:38,799
Come on, come on.

1140
00:56:39,912 --> 00:56:40,917
Quick.
- How you guys doing up there?

1141
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:42,760
Is everybody okay?

1142
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:43,854
- Here's the list of names.

1143
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:46,020
Which one of you guys is Skip?
- Let's make it quick,

1144
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:47,260
I don't want him to get suspicious.

1145
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:50,426
- Now look, inside the lid of
this cooler is a video camera.

1146
00:56:50,426 --> 00:56:51,820
- What, oh, look at that.

1147
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,557
How'd he get that in there?
- Pay attention.

1148
00:56:53,557 --> 00:56:55,660
- Now look guys, all you fellas have to do

1149
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,690
is keep the lid up,

1150
00:56:56,690 --> 00:56:59,160
and just point it in
George's general direction.

1151
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,700
Then forget about it.

1152
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,480
- Don't make it a big deal.

1153
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:03,400
You understand?

1154
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:06,123
- 62 kids in there.
- Okay, it's ready.

1155
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,440
You guys are doing a fine job up there.

1156
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:12,160
I just want you to know
how much everyone down here

1157
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,653
appreciates it.

1158
00:57:13,653 --> 00:57:14,893
Here you go, good luck.

1159
00:57:16,710 --> 00:57:19,425
- [Eckert] Come on, get going.

1160
00:57:19,425 --> 00:57:22,175
(dramatic music)

1161
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:24,655
- [Officer] Matt.

1162
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:25,488
- What?

1163
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,721
- [Officer] Your daughter's in there.

1164
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:31,780
(dramatic music)

1165
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,180
- No, no she's not.

1166
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:35,930
(dramatic music)

1167
00:57:37,688 --> 00:57:39,907
That's not right.

1168
00:57:39,907 --> 00:57:41,157
She's not here.

1169
00:57:42,294 --> 00:57:43,377
She's skiing.

1170
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:46,230
I said it was okay.

1171
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,980
(dramatic music)

1172
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:22,514
- Trav?

1173
00:58:24,899 --> 00:58:25,732
Travis?

1174
00:58:26,612 --> 00:58:27,445
Travis?

1175
00:58:31,185 --> 00:58:32,018
Travis.

1176
00:58:34,012 --> 00:58:34,845
Oh.

1177
00:58:44,534 --> 00:58:47,327
Look, bro, why'd he have to do that?

1178
00:58:47,327 --> 00:58:50,077
(dramatic music)

1179
00:58:51,491 --> 00:58:52,324
Trav.

1180
00:58:53,795 --> 00:58:54,628
Trav.

1181
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:03,871
Why did he have to go and do that?

1182
00:59:05,347 --> 00:59:08,350
- [Jason] What's taking
so long down there?

1183
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,183
Hurry up!

1184
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,629
- [Aaron] Frankie.

1185
00:59:13,629 --> 00:59:15,379
Frankie, we gotta go.

1186
00:59:18,447 --> 00:59:19,734
- [Jason] I'm gonna shoot somebody

1187
00:59:19,734 --> 00:59:22,184
if you don't get up here now.

1188
00:59:22,184 --> 00:59:24,658
- (crying) Damn, man.

1189
00:59:24,658 --> 00:59:27,408
(dramatic music)

1190
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,454
- [Jason] Quit screwing
around and get up here.

1191
00:59:32,454 --> 00:59:34,204
It's taking too long.

1192
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:38,806
- Frankie, he's gonna freak out.

1193
00:59:38,806 --> 00:59:41,556
(dramatic music)

1194
00:59:55,161 --> 00:59:58,507
- This thing really works.
- Great picture.

1195
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:10,313
- There he is.
- Bingo.

1196
01:00:10,313 --> 01:00:11,763
- I don't see her.

1197
01:00:11,763 --> 01:00:13,303
I don't see her, if she's up there,

1198
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:16,600
then why don't I see her?

1199
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:18,391
- Because she's probably in the back

1200
01:00:18,391 --> 01:00:20,703
being quiet like a smart girl.

1201
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:23,993
Oh, don't close it.

1202
01:00:28,096 --> 01:00:29,610
- [Jimmy] I don't know what's
wrong with this stupid thing.

1203
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:31,620
- What is it, what is it?
- Wanna see?

1204
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:33,880
Hey, we got the radio,
we can try some tunes.

1205
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,733
So, try the radio?
- Yeah, put 'em on.

1206
01:00:35,850 --> 01:00:36,683
- Oh, thank you kid.

1207
01:00:36,683 --> 01:00:38,133
This is really helpful.
- This is bull, man.

1208
01:00:38,133 --> 01:00:39,742
- [Brown] 12 gauge?

1209
01:00:39,742 --> 01:00:41,283
And what is that, .357?
- The rest of that pizza

1210
01:00:41,283 --> 01:00:42,274
better get here.

1211
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:44,730
They're screwing with us.

1212
01:00:44,730 --> 01:00:45,563
- I don't want any,

1213
01:00:45,563 --> 01:00:46,610
anyhow, so--
- Why?

1214
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,554
It' snot drugged, they
know I'm not eating any.

1215
01:00:48,554 --> 01:00:49,997
- Well, it's not that, it's just,

1216
01:00:49,997 --> 01:00:51,130
I'm a vegetarian.

1217
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:52,730
We only got pepperoni.

1218
01:00:52,730 --> 01:00:54,580
- Well, why didn't you say something?

1219
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,260
- Look, I don't wanna go along with the

1220
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:58,915
cops or anything, but

1221
01:00:58,915 --> 01:01:00,836
we don't have enough food for everyone.

1222
01:01:00,836 --> 01:01:02,863
Maybe we should let a few people go.

1223
01:01:04,811 --> 01:01:06,890
- Well, how many, I mean,

1224
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:10,120
what 10, 15?
- 15 sounds pretty good.

1225
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,655
- Fine, pick 'em.

1226
01:01:11,655 --> 01:01:14,100
- Well, I mean, I really
think it would be better

1227
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:15,578
if you picked them.
- Look.

1228
01:01:15,578 --> 01:01:16,940
You either pick them right
now, or you can forget it.

1229
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:19,150
Look, just take the bad ones.

1230
01:01:19,150 --> 01:01:22,923
And please, make her one.
(girl crying)

1231
01:01:23,990 --> 01:01:27,899
- [Aaron] You need to get
out of here, you need to go.

1232
01:01:27,899 --> 01:01:28,968
Lot of people.

1233
01:01:28,968 --> 01:01:29,801
Frankie.

1234
01:01:33,179 --> 01:01:34,514
- [Boy] Come on.

1235
01:01:34,514 --> 01:01:37,846
Please go, I'll be the only one, I'll go.

1236
01:01:37,846 --> 01:01:40,485
- Come on, it's time to go.

1237
01:01:40,485 --> 01:01:41,878
Frankie.

1238
01:01:41,878 --> 01:01:42,711
Come on.

1239
01:01:44,007 --> 01:01:45,980
You gotta get outta here, okay?

1240
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,813
- [Boy] We outta here.

1241
01:01:50,370 --> 01:01:51,350
- Yeah, you.

1242
01:01:58,061 --> 01:01:59,811
- What about me?
- Me.

1243
01:02:08,236 --> 01:02:09,652
- Hi.

1244
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:11,148
Did you wanna go?

1245
01:02:11,148 --> 01:02:12,533
- You can let someone else go.

1246
01:02:13,832 --> 01:02:15,599
- Right here, come on.
- I'll go.

1247
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:17,450
- Eric, can you let us go, man?

1248
01:02:17,450 --> 01:02:19,960
- My name's Aaron.
- Yeah, right, Aaron.

1249
01:02:19,960 --> 01:02:22,303
Look, I'll give you my disc player, man.

1250
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:24,123
You're so dead.

1251
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:27,103
If we ever get outta this
place, your ass is mine,

1252
01:02:27,103 --> 01:02:28,482
you understand that?

1253
01:02:28,482 --> 01:02:30,126
- Huh, huh, what?

1254
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:32,709
(upbeat music)

1255
01:02:39,552 --> 01:02:42,299
- [Aaron] Come on, come on, let's go.

1256
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:43,657
Let's go, come on.

1257
01:02:43,657 --> 01:02:45,544
- [Girl] Oh, please.

1258
01:02:45,544 --> 01:02:47,012
- [Aaron] Go.

1259
01:02:47,012 --> 01:02:49,069
Go, go, come through.

1260
01:02:49,069 --> 01:02:49,902
Go.

1261
01:02:50,899 --> 01:02:51,732
- Go on.

1262
01:02:53,055 --> 01:02:53,888
Go on.

1263
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:56,337
- [Girl] Thank you.

1264
01:02:56,337 --> 01:02:58,994
- [Radio DJ] 40 minutes of nonstop music

1265
01:02:58,994 --> 01:03:02,327
on Hot 97, with the Lakers accelerating.

1266
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:09,683
- Hey.

1267
01:03:09,683 --> 01:03:10,516
- Hi.

1268
01:03:12,403 --> 01:03:13,236
So,

1269
01:03:14,362 --> 01:03:15,862
why didn't you go?

1270
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:18,523
- Why didn't you go?

1271
01:03:18,523 --> 01:03:21,605
You could have picked yourself, you know.

1272
01:03:21,605 --> 01:03:24,365
- I guess I didn't really think about it.

1273
01:03:24,365 --> 01:03:25,532
- Yeah, right.

1274
01:03:28,313 --> 01:03:31,673
- I guess I just kinda wanna
see how it's gonna turn out.

1275
01:03:33,424 --> 01:03:35,240
It's messed up, huh?
- We interrupt this broadcast

1276
01:03:35,240 --> 01:03:36,420
for a special report--
- Shut up!

1277
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:37,450
- [Radio Reporter] With
some new information

1278
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:39,370
on the growing crisis
at Johnson High School.

1279
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,620
- Oh my god.

1280
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,600
- [Radio Reporter] As many
as six students are dead,

1281
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,330
and nearly 20 others are wounded

1282
01:03:44,330 --> 01:03:47,113
in what may be the worst mass
killing in state history.

1283
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:50,470
That is the latest--
- They said no one died!

1284
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,930
They said no one died.

1285
01:03:55,930 --> 01:03:57,457
- Somebody changed the channel.

1286
01:03:57,457 --> 01:03:58,760
- [Radio Reporter] The
FBI are on the scene

1287
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:02,340
where apparently 200 students
are still being held hostage.

1288
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,740
- Sam, dear?
- The gunman is believed to be

1289
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:04,968
Jason Copeland.

1290
01:04:04,968 --> 01:04:07,718
(dramatic music)

1291
01:04:10,047 --> 01:04:11,808
- Hey, where the hell do
you think you're going?

1292
01:04:11,808 --> 01:04:13,320
All you're gonna do is get her killed.

1293
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,101
- Well then, do something!

1294
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:16,745
Do something!
- Hey, hey.

1295
01:04:16,745 --> 01:04:20,163
If the phone starts him now,
he could pull the trigger.

1296
01:04:21,080 --> 01:04:23,090
(phone ringing)

1297
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:24,367
Hello?
- Hey Skip,

1298
01:04:24,367 --> 01:04:26,687
I got a serious problem here.

1299
01:04:26,687 --> 01:04:28,760
I don't know what to do.

1300
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:29,857
I need your help.

1301
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:33,029
You better talk to him.

1302
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:35,779
(dramatic music)

1303
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:50,170
Come on, George, don't.

1304
01:04:51,611 --> 01:04:53,878
George, please don't.

1305
01:04:53,878 --> 01:04:55,832
Okay, don't do this.

1306
01:04:55,832 --> 01:04:56,999
Don't do this.

1307
01:05:02,137 --> 01:05:03,720
- [Skip] Hi George.

1308
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,543
- Cut the crap.

1309
01:05:13,255 --> 01:05:14,293
You know who I am.

1310
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,780
- [Skip] Okay, that's true.

1311
01:05:18,780 --> 01:05:21,213
I just wanted you to be
comfortable enough to tell me your,

1312
01:05:21,213 --> 01:05:22,920
your name yourself.

1313
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,340
So, what is your real name?

1314
01:05:25,340 --> 01:05:26,173
- Jason.

1315
01:05:28,602 --> 01:05:29,523
- Okay.

1316
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,113
Hi Jason, how are you?

1317
01:05:33,847 --> 01:05:34,764
- Not good.

1318
01:05:38,629 --> 01:05:39,879
You lied to me.

1319
01:05:41,392 --> 01:05:43,392
You told me nobody died.

1320
01:05:45,203 --> 01:05:46,533
- And that's the truth.

1321
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:50,838
I don't know where you got
the other information from.

1322
01:05:50,838 --> 01:05:52,466
- Father.

1323
01:05:52,466 --> 01:05:54,529
- Lord in heaven.

1324
01:05:54,529 --> 01:05:58,033
- The radio, that's where.
- Thy kingdom come.

1325
01:05:58,033 --> 01:06:00,399
(praying softly)

1326
01:06:00,399 --> 01:06:03,343
- [Jason] They said a lot of people died.

1327
01:06:03,343 --> 01:06:06,670
- Okay, what you have
to understand, Jason,

1328
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:09,450
is that media loves to
sensationalize everything.

1329
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:10,900
They make everything bigger.

1330
01:06:10,900 --> 01:06:11,750
That's their job.

1331
01:06:13,730 --> 01:06:14,710
The truth is

1332
01:06:15,830 --> 01:06:16,920
nobody

1333
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:17,923
has died.

1334
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:19,864
- Liar.

1335
01:06:22,156 --> 01:06:23,156
- My heaven.

1336
01:06:24,300 --> 01:06:25,960
- I am not, Jason.

1337
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:27,523
I am not lying to you.

1338
01:06:27,523 --> 01:06:30,403
I want you to listen very,
very carefully, okay son?

1339
01:06:31,422 --> 01:06:33,190
What if you did kill all those people?

1340
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:34,023
You would not, look,

1341
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:35,370
you would not be in this school anymore.

1342
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,120
You would be in the morgue.

1343
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,580
'Cause no matter what you say,

1344
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:40,280
we could be in that room,
(snaps fingers) just like that,

1345
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:41,543
as fast as we want.

1346
01:06:44,254 --> 01:06:47,020
But I really believe that at this moment,

1347
01:06:47,020 --> 01:06:48,683
that just as necessary,

1348
01:06:50,350 --> 01:06:53,562
I really believe that
we can work this out.

1349
01:06:53,562 --> 01:06:56,312
(dramatic music)

1350
01:07:14,897 --> 01:07:17,730
(heavy breathing)

1351
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,079
- How?

1352
01:07:24,973 --> 01:07:26,534
How?

1353
01:07:26,534 --> 01:07:29,597
- [Skip] That's what
we're gonna do together.

1354
01:07:29,597 --> 01:07:32,347
(dramatic music)

1355
01:07:40,335 --> 01:07:41,168
Okay.

1356
01:07:46,070 --> 01:07:48,170
- Let's get Matt a cup of coffee.

1357
01:07:48,170 --> 01:07:49,003
Decaf.

1358
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:51,233
Bill,

1359
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,700
I want you to contact the radio
stations, and you make sure

1360
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:56,260
that nobody broadcasts
anymore injury reports.

1361
01:08:01,817 --> 01:08:04,400
(mellow music)

1362
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,473
- Come on, stop crying.

1363
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:15,963
I wasn't really gonna shoot you.

1364
01:08:19,614 --> 01:08:21,253
Look, I lost my temper.

1365
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:25,530
You wanna go to the bathroom?

1366
01:08:27,410 --> 01:08:28,660
Go ahead, it's all right.

1367
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:33,098
Why don't you see if
anybody else wants to go.

1368
01:08:33,098 --> 01:08:34,160
And then,

1369
01:08:34,160 --> 01:08:35,083
you be in charge.

1370
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:38,218
Go.

1371
01:08:40,622 --> 01:08:41,539
I said, go.

1372
01:08:43,455 --> 01:08:46,122
(phone beeping)

1373
01:08:47,602 --> 01:08:48,435
Yes.

1374
01:08:48,435 --> 01:08:50,852
Just, Skip, hold on a minute.

1375
01:08:57,690 --> 01:08:59,092
Skip?

1376
01:08:59,092 --> 01:09:00,880
You know, listen to me.

1377
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,630
I'm not coming out until we talk

1378
01:09:02,630 --> 01:09:04,230
about what's gonna happen to me.

1379
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:08,220
I'm not gonna spend the
rest of my life in a jail.

1380
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,870
- Tell him what he wants to hear.

1381
01:09:11,050 --> 01:09:12,910
- You know what I was thinking, Jason,

1382
01:09:12,910 --> 01:09:14,420
there's a very good possibility

1383
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,380
that there might not be
any jail time whatsoever.

1384
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,526
- You guys,

1385
01:09:18,526 --> 01:09:21,090
I'm gonna send you to the bathroom, okay.

1386
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,944
But don't come back.

1387
01:09:22,944 --> 01:09:24,240
- Look, look, come on.

1388
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:27,330
I know I'm not gonna get
slapped on the wrist for this,

1389
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:28,820
but if you stick me in a fricking cell,

1390
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:31,260
don't you think I'm gonna go
crazier than I already am?

1391
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,370
- All right, well then, let
me ask you this question:

1392
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,580
what do you think an
appropriate punishment would be

1393
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,091
for Jason Copeland?

1394
01:09:37,091 --> 01:09:39,674
(mellow music)

1395
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:50,082
- They're back.
- It's just all a mistake,

1396
01:09:50,082 --> 01:09:51,741
you know?

1397
01:09:51,741 --> 01:09:53,031
I mean...

1398
01:09:53,031 --> 01:09:55,698
(kids chatting)

1399
01:10:01,707 --> 01:10:03,624
- Pick Frankie.
- Okay.

1400
01:10:05,736 --> 01:10:09,236
- [Radio DJ] Four non-stop hits on Hot 97.

1401
01:10:10,505 --> 01:10:11,755
- Hey, Frankie.

1402
01:10:12,983 --> 01:10:14,961
Frankie, you've been up here a long time.

1403
01:10:14,961 --> 01:10:18,192
Why don't you go down to the
bathroom and wash up a little.

1404
01:10:18,192 --> 01:10:19,025
Okay?

1405
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,821
Come on, let's go.

1406
01:10:21,821 --> 01:10:22,654
Come on.

1407
01:10:33,502 --> 01:10:35,585
Frankie, don't come back.

1408
01:10:37,101 --> 01:10:38,190
We'll be down soon.

1409
01:10:46,690 --> 01:10:48,680
- What, Sam, you're not going to pick us?

1410
01:10:48,680 --> 01:10:50,300
Jealous?

1411
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:51,720
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

1412
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:53,340
- Drop it, Kathy.
- No, no.

1413
01:10:53,340 --> 01:10:54,703
It's just that I don't expect
to find my best friend or my--

1414
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:57,503
- Hey, hey, are you guys demented?

1415
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,960
- [Sam] You know what,
just go, both of you.

1416
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,010
Just get out of here.

1417
01:11:17,012 --> 01:11:19,762
(dramatic music)

1418
01:11:50,024 --> 01:11:53,240
- You know how some people were born

1419
01:11:53,240 --> 01:11:54,073
winners,

1420
01:11:55,895 --> 01:11:56,843
and some losers?

1421
01:11:57,970 --> 01:11:58,803
- [Skip] I do.

1422
01:12:03,093 --> 01:12:04,107
But let me tell you something.

1423
01:12:04,107 --> 01:12:07,840
You're not alone in this
feeling of not belonging.

1424
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:09,690
I totally understand that.

1425
01:12:09,690 --> 01:12:10,940
I deal with it every day.

1426
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,220
Hey, Jason?

1427
01:12:19,220 --> 01:12:20,053
Um,

1428
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:26,110
you know what, I have
to take a break here.

1429
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,450
All the coffee is starting to get to me.

1430
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:28,810
I gotta go to the men's room.

1431
01:12:28,810 --> 01:12:30,140
I'm gonna call you right back.

1432
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,040
Is that all right?

1433
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:33,650
Is that all right?

1434
01:12:40,186 --> 01:12:41,203
- Okay.

1435
01:12:41,203 --> 01:12:43,033
- All right, thanks buddy.

1436
01:12:49,561 --> 01:12:52,978
(intense dramatic music)

1437
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,420
Hey ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

1438
01:13:08,384 --> 01:13:10,380
You're getting ready to
take him out, aren't you?

1439
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:12,270
- Sniper's in place, we've got the shot.

1440
01:13:12,270 --> 01:13:13,970
- Yeah, but that's not necessary.

1441
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,510
The kids are leaving the room in droves.

1442
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,410
He's ready to give up.

1443
01:13:16,410 --> 01:13:18,270
What happens if the sniper misses?

1444
01:13:18,270 --> 01:13:19,300
- Won't happen.

1445
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:21,330
- Can you guarantee that?
- Can you guarantee

1446
01:13:21,330 --> 01:13:23,375
he won't short circuit again?

1447
01:13:23,375 --> 01:13:25,370
- Look, you've got a shooter in place.

1448
01:13:25,370 --> 01:13:28,030
If he goes south, you can
pop him just like that.

1449
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:29,580
I'm this close, Sheriff.

1450
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:33,338
I'm asking you, please,
let me finish my job.

1451
01:13:33,338 --> 01:13:36,088
(dramatic music)

1452
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:48,916
- [Officer] Red light.

1453
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:51,666
(dramatic music)

1454
01:13:53,178 --> 01:13:54,678
Repeat, red light.

1455
01:13:56,450 --> 01:13:57,283
Red light.

1456
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:08,050
- You better be right,
because if we did it my way,

1457
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:10,450
we'd be sending in the
clean up crews right now.

1458
01:14:20,023 --> 01:14:22,100
- [Skip] Now, I've seen a lot
of judges show compassion,

1459
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,020
especially after a guy like
me stands up and says, look,

1460
01:14:25,020 --> 01:14:28,100
he really had a tough time.

1461
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,670
You know, he just kind of
lost it there for a bit.

1462
01:14:30,670 --> 01:14:32,360
Judges really consider that.

1463
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:34,840
- Look, how much time do
you think I'm gonna get?

1464
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:37,150
- All right, well, that's
a very good question.

1465
01:14:37,150 --> 01:14:38,130
I can only guess at that.

1466
01:14:38,130 --> 01:14:41,170
I would say that you would get, um,

1467
01:14:41,170 --> 01:14:43,160
approximately,

1468
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:44,843
probably under five years.

1469
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:49,720
And you know that most of
that could counseling time.

1470
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:50,760
- Well, that's what I need, man.

1471
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,700
I need more counseling than jail time.

1472
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:54,240
- That's right, I agree with you.

1473
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,810
And I hope that you are not
picturing those big, you know,

1474
01:14:56,810 --> 01:14:58,351
stone fortresses.

1475
01:14:58,351 --> 01:15:01,380
This is kind of like a
detention home, you know,

1476
01:15:01,380 --> 01:15:02,940
and they even have programs

1477
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,790
where you can go out during the day,

1478
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:07,597
and go to school.
- Skip, Skip, listen.

1479
01:15:07,597 --> 01:15:09,810
I can't be stuck in with gang members.

1480
01:15:09,810 --> 01:15:12,840
- [Skip] If you want me to, I
will use my contacts for you.

1481
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:13,673
- You mean that?

1482
01:15:13,673 --> 01:15:16,553
All right, how do I know you're
gonna keep your word, huh?

1483
01:15:16,553 --> 01:15:18,850
- [Skip] Have I ever lied to you before?

1484
01:15:18,850 --> 01:15:21,168
- Will they put it in writing?

1485
01:15:21,168 --> 01:15:23,577
- Listen, I want everything I agree to,

1486
01:15:23,577 --> 01:15:25,490
you to put in writing,
and then I'll come out.

1487
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:27,800
- Okay, we have no problem
with a written agreement.

1488
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,930
But before I can send
that up to you, Jason,

1489
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:32,830
I'm gonna need a good
faith release of hostages.

1490
01:15:32,830 --> 01:15:33,830
- [Jason] All right, I'll send down five.

1491
01:15:33,830 --> 01:15:36,010
And then when the contract
comes up, if I like it,

1492
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,310
I'll let the rest go.

1493
01:15:37,310 --> 01:15:39,070
- Well, I don't think five is gonna do it.

1494
01:15:39,070 --> 01:15:41,253
We were thinking more in terms of 10.

1495
01:15:43,090 --> 01:15:46,014
- Seven.
- How 'bout 15?

1496
01:15:46,014 --> 01:15:47,110
- 10.

1497
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:50,860
- How 'bout this: five guys, 10 girls.

1498
01:15:50,860 --> 01:15:53,550
It'll look great in the press,
you get rid of all the girls,

1499
01:15:53,550 --> 01:15:56,350
and it's a smart move on your part.

1500
01:15:56,350 --> 01:15:58,150
- All right.
- Okay?

1501
01:15:58,150 --> 01:15:59,880
All right, you know what I was thinking?

1502
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:02,130
Look, you've got 45 kids up there.

1503
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:04,490
Why don't you just send down
an even half, all right.

1504
01:16:04,490 --> 01:16:06,203
Keep 20, send the rest.

1505
01:16:09,060 --> 01:16:11,320
- Okay.
- Great, great, all right,

1506
01:16:11,320 --> 01:16:12,630
then I'll tell you what.
- You pick kids.

1507
01:16:12,630 --> 01:16:14,690
- I'll start drawing up the contract,

1508
01:16:14,690 --> 01:16:16,340
and I will send it up

1509
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:18,930
as soon as we start
seeing the kids come out.

1510
01:16:18,930 --> 01:16:21,350
And I'm gonna call you right back, okay?

1511
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,448
- Okay.
- Okay.

1512
01:16:22,448 --> 01:16:25,198
(chuckling)
What?

1513
01:16:26,230 --> 01:16:28,201
- [Brown] You're terrific.

1514
01:16:28,201 --> 01:16:29,034
- [Skip] What?

1515
01:16:29,034 --> 01:16:30,230
- Well, you missed your calling.

1516
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:31,280
All that wheeling and dealing,

1517
01:16:31,280 --> 01:16:33,051
you should have been a used car salesman.

1518
01:16:33,051 --> 01:16:35,579
(laughing)

1519
01:16:35,579 --> 01:16:39,030
What, what's so funny?
- I was a used car salesman.

1520
01:16:39,030 --> 01:16:41,209
- Get outta here!
- That was my job before this.

1521
01:16:41,209 --> 01:16:44,434
- (laughing) It's perfect.

1522
01:16:44,434 --> 01:16:49,434
(dramatic music)
(parents chatting)

1523
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:55,424
- [Man] They're letting them out.

1524
01:16:55,424 --> 01:17:00,424
(dramatic music)
(people shouting)

1525
01:17:27,025 --> 01:17:28,452
- Samantha.

1526
01:17:28,452 --> 01:17:30,760
Where's Samantha, Kathy?
- She's still in there.

1527
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,678
Her and Aaron were the ones
that helped us get out.

1528
01:17:32,678 --> 01:17:37,601
- Kathy?
- Daddy?

1529
01:17:37,601 --> 01:17:39,777
- You know, you know my son, don't you?

1530
01:17:39,777 --> 01:17:40,718
You remember him?

1531
01:17:40,718 --> 01:17:43,033
You remember Travis, have you seen him?

1532
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,723
Have you seen him today?

1533
01:17:45,640 --> 01:17:49,020
He left in a gray sweatshirt
this morning, what had a hood.

1534
01:17:50,427 --> 01:17:53,530
Did you see my son, please?

1535
01:17:53,530 --> 01:17:54,660
Please?

1536
01:17:54,660 --> 01:17:56,042
Don't you know who he is?

1537
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:57,755
Do you know who he is?

1538
01:17:57,755 --> 01:18:01,331
(dramatic music)

1539
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:03,090
- How's it look.

1540
01:18:03,090 --> 01:18:03,923
Huh?

1541
01:18:03,923 --> 01:18:05,423
What do you think?

1542
01:18:06,467 --> 01:18:08,113
- One to five years.

1543
01:18:10,090 --> 01:18:11,383
That's sounds pretty good.

1544
01:18:18,967 --> 01:18:22,650
- No, no, no, no, as soon
as I walk through the door,

1545
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:23,860
they're gonna rip it up, man.

1546
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:26,510
And then it's gonna be my
word against theirs, right?

1547
01:18:27,380 --> 01:18:30,230
- Well, how about if you have all of us

1548
01:18:30,230 --> 01:18:31,740
sign it as witnesses,

1549
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,023
and I can go downstairs
and make a bunch of copies.

1550
01:18:34,023 --> 01:18:36,630
They can't possibly rip them all up.

1551
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:38,410
- That'll work, that'll work.

1552
01:18:46,373 --> 01:18:47,403
No, no, no.

1553
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:49,961
Hey, you, come here.

1554
01:18:49,961 --> 01:18:50,903
Let her do it.

1555
01:18:52,510 --> 01:18:53,343
Here.

1556
01:18:53,343 --> 01:18:55,613
Get the kids to sign it,
and make a bunch of copies.

1557
01:18:57,317 --> 01:18:59,234
- Does he believe this?

1558
01:19:14,923 --> 01:19:17,673
(dramatic music)

1559
01:19:36,413 --> 01:19:39,080
(door rattling)

1560
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:49,915
Frankie?

1561
01:19:53,399 --> 01:19:54,661
Oh my god.

1562
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,411
(dramatic music)

1563
01:20:00,568 --> 01:20:02,613
- We'll be right out.

1564
01:20:02,613 --> 01:20:05,363
(dramatic music)

1565
01:20:21,445 --> 01:20:23,162
- [Boy] Yeah, I know.

1566
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:27,249
- [Girl] I'm gonna ask
for the credit cards,

1567
01:20:27,249 --> 01:20:31,773
and a car. (laughing)

1568
01:20:31,773 --> 01:20:32,723
- Here you go, bro.

1569
01:20:40,560 --> 01:20:42,214
- Frankie, where's Samantha?

1570
01:20:42,214 --> 01:20:44,406
- Chill man, I sent her home.

1571
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:45,380
- I thought you left already.

1572
01:20:45,380 --> 01:20:48,149
- You don't think I'm just
gonna let him walk away

1573
01:20:48,149 --> 01:20:50,127
after what he did to Travis, do you?

1574
01:20:51,810 --> 01:20:54,140
What, I'm just gonna hurt him.

1575
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:55,110
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1576
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:57,650
There's nothing in here
about the private cell.

1577
01:20:57,650 --> 01:20:58,603
We agreed.

1578
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:00,090
- Yes we did, yes we did.

1579
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:02,070
It's an oversight on my part, Jason.

1580
01:21:02,070 --> 01:21:03,800
You know what, it's arranged.

1581
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:05,856
It's all arranged.
- Do not do this.

1582
01:21:05,856 --> 01:21:07,411
Now, we are almost outta here.

1583
01:21:07,411 --> 01:21:09,277
Do not sink to his level.

1584
01:21:09,277 --> 01:21:11,319
Talk to the police, we'll need them.

1585
01:21:11,319 --> 01:21:12,686
Forget him.
- Get off.

1586
01:21:12,686 --> 01:21:15,436
(dramatic music)

1587
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:23,230
- Jason, Jason, why don't
you kind of stand up

1588
01:21:23,230 --> 01:21:25,620
and stretch your legs, you
know, get the blood going.

1589
01:21:25,620 --> 01:21:26,620
- Hey, what are you doing?

1590
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:27,453
- Frankie!
- Frankie!

1591
01:21:27,453 --> 01:21:28,286
- Jason?

1592
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:35,860
- You're gonna try to kill me, Frankie?

1593
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,906
What did I ever do to you?

1594
01:21:38,906 --> 01:21:41,945
(dramatic music)

1595
01:21:41,945 --> 01:21:43,421
- What you done to me?

1596
01:21:43,421 --> 01:21:45,015
Why don't you ask Travis
what you did to him!

1597
01:21:45,015 --> 01:21:46,527
Why don't you talk to Travis!

1598
01:21:46,527 --> 01:21:48,072
- Don't listen to him Jason.
- Talk to Travis.

1599
01:21:48,072 --> 01:21:49,460
- He doesn't know what he's talking about.

1600
01:21:49,460 --> 01:21:50,680
Please, he's a troublemaker.

1601
01:21:50,680 --> 01:21:52,355
He always has been, I swear to God.

1602
01:21:52,355 --> 01:21:54,075
We just gotta get him outta here, okay.

1603
01:21:54,075 --> 01:21:56,825
(dramatic music)

1604
01:21:59,954 --> 01:22:01,118
Frankie.

1605
01:22:01,118 --> 01:22:01,953
Frankie!

1606
01:22:01,953 --> 01:22:03,543
You listen to me.

1607
01:22:03,543 --> 01:22:05,624
Now, he will get what he deserves.

1608
01:22:05,624 --> 01:22:06,457
I promise.

1609
01:22:07,398 --> 01:22:08,231
I promise.

1610
01:22:13,483 --> 01:22:15,925
- I guess it's too good for him.

1611
01:22:15,925 --> 01:22:18,675
(dramatic music)

1612
01:22:19,629 --> 01:22:24,629
(screaming)
(scissors clatter)

1613
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:31,120
- Bye, let's go.
- Okay, bye.

1614
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,039
- Bye Jason.
- Bye Aaron.

1615
01:22:33,039 --> 01:22:34,381
- [Boy] See you guys.

1616
01:22:34,381 --> 01:22:35,214
Bye now.

1617
01:22:36,506 --> 01:22:39,664
- Good luck, man.
- Bye Jason.

1618
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:42,331
(kids chatting)

1619
01:22:45,229 --> 01:22:47,979
- [Girl] See you tomorrow.

1620
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:49,553
- Hey, hey.

1621
01:22:49,553 --> 01:22:52,460
Can you stick around for a minute?

1622
01:22:56,905 --> 01:22:59,655
(dramatic music)

1623
01:23:03,667 --> 01:23:06,084
Thanks for all your help.

1624
01:23:06,084 --> 01:23:08,834
(dramatic music)

1625
01:23:16,031 --> 01:23:17,698
- [Aaron] Good luck.

1626
01:23:20,365 --> 01:23:22,277
- It's all right.

1627
01:23:22,277 --> 01:23:25,027
(dramatic music)

1628
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:51,333
(phone beeping)

1629
01:23:58,470 --> 01:23:59,303
Skip?

1630
01:23:59,303 --> 01:24:02,743
- Jason, you have done just a great job.

1631
01:24:03,630 --> 01:24:05,693
Let's not have any slip ups now, okay?

1632
01:24:07,176 --> 01:24:09,330
Now, first thing I want you to do,

1633
01:24:09,330 --> 01:24:12,030
take all of your guns and
just put them in the corner.

1634
01:24:15,306 --> 01:24:16,714
- All right.

1635
01:24:16,714 --> 01:24:19,664
- All right, make sure that
you have absolutely no weapons.

1636
01:24:21,361 --> 01:24:23,833
And then I want you to
call me one more time.

1637
01:24:26,290 --> 01:24:27,953
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

1638
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,680
(dramatic music)

1639
01:24:45,969 --> 01:24:49,636
(parents and kids shouting)

1640
01:25:00,730 --> 01:25:01,563
- Frankie.

1641
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:03,313
Frankie.

1642
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,263
Where's Travis, baby?

1643
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:08,933
Where's Travis?

1644
01:25:10,970 --> 01:25:12,120
He's coming out, right?

1645
01:25:13,203 --> 01:25:14,150
- Mrs. McGill?

1646
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:15,570
- He's coming out, right?

1647
01:25:15,570 --> 01:25:17,453
- Mrs. McGill?
- He's coming out, right?

1648
01:25:17,453 --> 01:25:20,324
- [Principal Dresser]
Can you come with us?

1649
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:22,290
- He's coming out.

1650
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,480
Travis,

1651
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:24,450
my...

1652
01:25:24,450 --> 01:25:25,938
He's coming out.

1653
01:25:25,938 --> 01:25:26,853
- Mrs. McGill,

1654
01:25:27,808 --> 01:25:30,757
why don't you--
- Don't!

1655
01:25:30,757 --> 01:25:33,650
Don't you Mrs. McGill me.

1656
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:35,250
And don't you sugarcoat nothing.

1657
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:44,920
Is my son dead?

1658
01:25:46,755 --> 01:25:48,594
- Yes.
- Is my son dead?

1659
01:25:48,594 --> 01:25:51,049
- I'm so sorry.
- Is my son dead?

1660
01:25:51,049 --> 01:25:51,982
No!

1661
01:25:51,982 --> 01:25:52,918
No!

1662
01:25:52,918 --> 01:25:53,906
You're lying!

1663
01:25:53,906 --> 01:25:55,050
You're lying!

1664
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:59,900
You're lying! (crying)

1665
01:26:05,190 --> 01:26:06,313
My son!

1666
01:26:06,313 --> 01:26:07,563
My son, oh God.

1667
01:26:08,937 --> 01:26:09,770
Oh god.

1668
01:26:10,787 --> 01:26:11,954
Oh god please.

1669
01:26:14,612 --> 01:26:15,612
- All right.

1670
01:26:18,558 --> 01:26:19,391
Um,

1671
01:26:20,290 --> 01:26:21,903
I'm ready to come down now.

1672
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:26,233
Skip?

1673
01:26:28,070 --> 01:26:29,317
I was hoping that

1674
01:26:30,330 --> 01:26:32,623
maybe that you could come up here,

1675
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:36,103
and maybe you could walk down with me?

1676
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:40,503
- I would really like
that, son, I really would.

1677
01:26:41,890 --> 01:26:42,823
But I can't.

1678
01:26:44,428 --> 01:26:45,490
But I promise you this.

1679
01:26:45,490 --> 01:26:48,593
I will be the first face you
see when you step outside.

1680
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,083
- Okay.

1681
01:26:58,240 --> 01:27:00,300
- Now look, I feel
really silly about this,

1682
01:27:00,300 --> 01:27:02,383
but there's one more precaution.

1683
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,420
Could you take off your shirt?

1684
01:27:06,660 --> 01:27:08,462
That way everyone will see that there is

1685
01:27:08,462 --> 01:27:10,663
absolutely no concealed weapon.

1686
01:27:12,351 --> 01:27:15,920
- Look, man, I don't
want any cameras on me.

1687
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,750
I don't want people taking
my picture with my shirt off.

1688
01:27:18,750 --> 01:27:20,493
- I just don't want any mistakes.

1689
01:27:28,694 --> 01:27:30,045
- Okay.

1690
01:27:30,045 --> 01:27:32,795
(dramatic music)

1691
01:28:20,979 --> 01:28:22,227
All right.

1692
01:28:22,227 --> 01:28:24,147
I'm ready to come down now.

1693
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:27,849
(dramatic music)

1694
01:28:46,126 --> 01:28:47,512
- I promised him.

1695
01:28:47,512 --> 01:28:48,731
I promised him.
- Just wait.

1696
01:28:48,731 --> 01:28:49,590
- I said I was gonna--

1697
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:51,355
- You've done everything you can do.

1698
01:28:51,355 --> 01:28:54,105

1699
01:28:56,740 --> 01:28:58,488

We can't see behind his back.

Where's the weapon?

1705
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,401

I heard he killed Mr. Kroft.
- Yeah.

- He was the only teacher that
ever bothered to talk to me.

1740
01:31:11,150 --> 01:31:12,033

if anyone can talk his way
out of trouble, it'd be Aaron.
