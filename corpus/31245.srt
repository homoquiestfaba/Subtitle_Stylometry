1
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:25,145
A dollar for a homeless vet.
Come on, little man.

2
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,481
Come on, little man.
I fought the war
with your daddy.

3
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,276
Y'all ain't paid me
for this leg yet.
Thank you, sugar.

4
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,153
Jackie Chan!
Jackie Chan!

5
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,322
Shanghai Noon.

6
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:41,161
I take traveller’s checks.
Arigato to you too.
Thank you, sugar.

7
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:49,627
Here you go.
Thanks.

8
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:17,030
You kids!

9
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,542
Here.
Hold it right there!

10
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,212
- What happened?
- Step away from her.

11
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,214
Oh, man,
he ain't done nothing.

12
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,257
Those kids.
Who took your bag?
This man?

13
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,427
No, it was a couple of punks.
They came and they just ran off.

14
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,429
Four-eight, this is Romano.
Robbery and assault victim...

15
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,515
with facial wound
at East 42nd entrance.

16
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,684
Sir, I'd like you
to just stand right there.

17
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,937
Certainly.
Are you travelling somewhere?

18
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:52,357
I have arrived.
My travels are over
for the time being.

19
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,026
Where's your luggage?

20
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,905
I don't require luggage.
Do you have a ticket?

21
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,907
Train ticket?
Ticket stub?

22
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,535
I didn't arrive by train.

23
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,454
Would you remove your sunglasses
for me, please?

24
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,251
Oh, I'd rather not.
I'd forgotten,
but I mean, wow,

25
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,420
Your planet
is really bright.

26
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,923
I see.
East 42, we have an E.D.P.

27
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,050
I have to ask you
to come with us, sir.

28
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,052
Of course.

29
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,659
Freddy!

30
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,580
Did you see this fella
come out of a gate?

31
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,916
He didn't come from no gate.
Brother came from nowhere.

32
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,044
You know what I'm saying?

33
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,129
Yeah, Freddy,
I know what you're saying.

34
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:48,742
I don't wanna go outside,
because there's things
that can kill you--

35
00:06:53,705 --> 00:06:55,582
Thank you.

36
00:06:55,707 --> 00:06:57,709
If you breathe
all those chemicals out there,

37
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,587
not to mention the cosmic rays
and the West Nile virus,

38
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,424
and that other one--
the new airborne pigeon disease
nobody wants to talk about.

39
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,426
The new pigeon disease.
I've heard of that.

40
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:09,387
Another thing that's been
bothering me is the food.

41
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,474
The cafeteria serves
lukewarm food,
full of germs.

42
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,726
You really need to do something
about that, Dr. Powel I.

43
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,728
Heat is the only thing
that kills germs. Heat.

44
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:20,523
Point taken.
We'll look into that
right away.

45
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:25,028
In the meantime,
I want you to start taking
Your medication again.

46
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,781
It'll help you sleep.
And you need the sleep, Ernie.

47
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,824
Sleep is good.

48
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,747
Is our time up?

49
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,166
Only for today, Ernie.

50
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,004
Two calls:
Your wife, bring home
a bottle of wine.

51
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,006
Yeah.
And Dr. Chakraborty.

52
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,592
A transfer from Bellevue
he wants you to take a look at.

53
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:52,138
Great. Who is it this time?
Jesus Christ or Joan of Arc?

54
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,974
Dr. Chakraborty didn't say.

55
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,586
He arrived at Bellevue
a month ago,

56
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,131
suspicion of
hallucinogenic intoxication.

57
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:29,467
But, uh, he was found
negative for substances
of any kind.

58
00:08:29,551 --> 00:08:31,845
His EKG, his blood value
are all normal.

59
00:08:31,928 --> 00:08:34,222
There's no sign of concussion,
no brain tumor,

60
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:38,059
no temporal lobe, epilepsy,
no indication of organic
abnormality whatsoever.

61
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,603
However, after one month,

62
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,523
his amnesia and his delusion
have persisted.

63
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,027
He claims to be not human.

64
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:49,571
A visitor
from another planet.

65
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,449
They administered Thorazine
on this guy for three weeks...

66
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:56,244
at 300 milligrams a day,
and he was unresponsive?

67
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,748
How can you be unresponsive
to 300 milligrams of Thorazine?
It's impossible.

68
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,833
That's why
they sent him to you.

69
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,419
Terrific.

70
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,881
No I.D.,
no missing persons report
matching his description.

71
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,342
What's this?

72
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,261
He had it on him.

73
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:19,017
Well, let's hope
extraterrestrials
qualify for Medicaid.

74
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:22,354
He's here, Doctor.

75
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:25,065
Thank you, Joyce.

76
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:29,903
Medical record 2-8-7.
Calls himself Prot.

77
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,909
This one's as gentle
as a pussycat, Doc.

78
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:38,536
Come in.
Have a seat.

79
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,749
"Have a seat."
Curious expression.

80
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:47,087
Well, let me introduce
myself. I'm--

81
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,714
Dr. Mark Powell,
Chief of Clinical Psychiatry...

82
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,300
of the Manhattan
Psychiatric Institute.

83
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,220
Good. You know
where you are.

84
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,684
Well, now, uh...
Prot, is it?

85
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:04,062
"Prote."
I see, "Prote."

86
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,107
Well, Prot,
we're here to--
May I?

87
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:10,568
Please.

88
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,241
Red delicious.
You call this variety.

89
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:19,786
It's my favorite.

90
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,164
I'd like to begin
by asking you...

91
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,792
if you know
why you're here.

92
00:10:25,917 --> 00:10:29,170
Of course.
You think I'm crazy.

93
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:35,927
We prefer the term "ill."
Do you think you are ill?

94
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,304
A little homesick, perhaps.

95
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,016
Really.
Where is home?

96
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,268
K-PAX.

97
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,311
K-PAX?

98
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:47,689
Capital "K," hyphen,
capitals "P-A-X."

99
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:50,191
K-PAX is a planet.

100
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,778
But don't worry,
I'm not going to
leap out of your chest.

101
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:56,781
I'm not worried.

102
00:10:56,865 --> 00:10:59,284
It’s just that I'm only
familiar with nine planets.

103
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:01,745
Well, actually, there are ten,
but that doesn't matter.

104
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:03,955
I'm not from
Your solar system.

105
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,334
K-PAX is about 1 ,000
of your light-years
away from here...

106
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,170
in what you would call
Your constellation Lyra.

107
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,505
That's quite a ways.

108
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,632
I'm curious.
How did you get to Earth?

109
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:20,972
It's a matter of harnessing
the energy of light.

110
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,600
I know that sounds
crazy to you.

111
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,770
You beings are eons away
from discovering light travel.

112
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,732
You travel
at the speed of light?

113
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:35,987
Oh, no. We can travel
many times that speed.
Various multiples of "C."

114
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:40,241
Otherwise, the trip here
would have taken about
1 ,000 years now, wouldn't it?

115
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,914
What if, um,
I were to tell you...

116
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,875
that according to a man
who lived on our planet
named Einstein,

117
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:53,880
that nothing can travel
faster than the speed
of light?

118
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:57,217
I would say that you misread
Einstein, Dr. Powell.
May I call you Mark?

119
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,387
You see, Mark,
what Einstein actually said...

120
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:02,764
was that nothing can accelerate
to the speed of light,

121
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,849
because its mass
would become infinite.

122
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,978
Einstein said nothing about
entities already travelling
at the speed of light or faster,

123
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,273
- at tachyon speeds.
- Tachyon?

124
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,027
I detect a note
of skepticism, Dr. Powell.

125
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,571
Oh, not at all.
It's just that you--

126
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,865
You speak English
so well.

127
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,952
I'm amazed.
Well, English isn't that
difficult a language to learn.

128
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:29,916
You should try speaking--

129
00:12:33,086 --> 00:12:36,047
I'm--
I'm confused.

130
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:38,675
Maybe you can explain
it to me. Uh...

131
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,845
how is it that
being a visitor from space,

132
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:44,472
that you-you look
so much like me...

133
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,058
or anyone else from Earth?

134
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:53,940
Why is a soap bubble round?

135
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,276
Why is a soap bubble round?

136
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:59,946
You know, for an educated
person, Mark, you repeat
things quite a bit.

137
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,449
Are you aware of that?

138
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,786
A soap bubble is round...

139
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:10,623
because it is the most
energy-efficient configuration.

140
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,420
Similarly, on your planet,
I look like you.

141
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,964
On K-PAX,
I look like a K-PAXian.

142
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:20,592
Prot,

143
00:13:20,675 --> 00:13:23,178
why did you want to
come to our planet?

144
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,307
Well, I've been here
many times before.

145
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:30,935
But what brought me
here first? I don't know.

146
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:33,563
Pure curiosity, I guess.

147
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,816
I'd never been to
a Class BA-3 planet before.

148
00:13:36,941 --> 00:13:38,985
Class BA-3?

149
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,987
Early stage of evolution.

150
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:44,324
Future uncertain.

151
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:47,452
And if I give all my possessions
to feed the poor--

152
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:51,498
Howie. Go on.
Talk to him.

153
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:54,501
Go on.

154
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,796
You're really from...
up there?

155
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,007
Indeed.

156
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,969
I am from K-PAX.

157
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,639
What--

158
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:10,308
What sort of place is it?

159
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,144
K-PAX is bigger
than your planet.

160
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:18,274
But we are circled
by seven purple moons.

161
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:20,985
Bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit, bullshit,

162
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,863
bullshit, bullshit,
bullshit.

163
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,532
Go on.

164
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:33,498
Well, K-PAX is most lovely
when K-MON and K-RIL
are in conjunction.

165
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:38,169
Those are our two suns.
What you would call
Agape and Satori.

166
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:12,037
You finish
Your homework, Abby?
Yeah.

167
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,122
I lost another tooth.

168
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:18,043
Oh, yeah? Let me see.
Hey! Maybe the tooth fairy
will come tonight, huh?

169
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:20,295
There's no such thing
as the tooth fairy, Dad.

170
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:22,797
There’s just you and Mom.

171
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:26,926
I fed them already.
I couldn't wait.
How was your day?

172
00:15:27,052 --> 00:15:31,431
Oh, 6:15 was late.
Didn't leave the station
til 6.:30.

173
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,433
Should have caught
the nearest beam of light.

174
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,435
You should have caught what?

175
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,063
Oh, nothing.
How was your day?
Good.

176
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:42,025
Sent the deposit in
for the house on the cape for
the last two weeks of August.

177
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,986
Which works out perfectly,
'cause Abby doesn't get out
of camp till the 15th.

178
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:46,988
Sent the deposit in?

179
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,115
Yeah.
Come on, Rache.

180
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:52,619
That wasn't definite.
We were just talking.
I said maybe.

181
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,996
Maybe sometime in August
we'll clear it.

182
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,750
Maybe. Maybe we should start
paying you for your time.
You got a family rate?

183
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,253
Oh, look.
They published my letter.

184
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:07,509
I spoke with Natalie about going
into the after-school program
next year,

185
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,136
in case
I go back to teaching.

186
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:14,140
And this morning my head
fell off, but I was able to sew
it back on with dental floss.

187
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:18,019
Waxed, of course.
Dental floss?

188
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:20,021
Sorry.
I wasn't I listening.

189
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,148
Yeah, I know.
Let's just eat.

190
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,695
Train was late.
I'm tired.

191
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,280
And to top it off,
the city is dumping
patients on us.

192
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:31,783
I know.

193
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:40,041
You stink.

194
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:44,587
Have a nice day, Sal.

195
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:47,757
I've been to 64 planets
within our galaxy.

196
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:52,053
Earth is the only one
with your species, Homo sapiens,
that I've visited so far.

197
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,055
And when did you arrive
on Earth?

198
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,266
Four years and nine months ago.

199
00:16:56,349 --> 00:16:58,268
So that makes you how old?

200
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,312
In Earth terms, 337 years old.

201
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:05,692
I aged about seven getting here,
travelling at six multiples
of "C."

202
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,695
But really, Marko,
it only seemed like an instant.

203
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:13,491
Marko?
Time may warp
at super light speed.

204
00:17:13,575 --> 00:17:16,786
I'd say
access one psychosis NOS.

205
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:20,707
That's glib to
call him a psychotic.
That's a wastebasket diagnosis.

206
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:24,127
Oh, yeah?
He believes he travelled
here from another planet.

207
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,338
What's your diagnosis,
jet lag?

208
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,882
Well, how come he didn't
respond to the Haldol?

209
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,884
Haldol can make you
more psychotic.

210
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,261
It's rare,
but it does happen.

211
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:37,807
Look. I'm not saying
that medication can't be
a useful tool...

212
00:17:37,891 --> 00:17:40,268
to help somebody like this,
but you can't--

213
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,230
He maybe a good subject
for the "Betazine" protocol.
The drug's on clinical trial.

214
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:47,025
You want to experiment on him
before we have a diagnosis?

215
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,361
Do you have some other idea?

216
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:53,406
He's not a danger to anyone.
How about getting
to know him first?

217
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:57,202
In the meantime,
we have ten new transfers
to take care of.

218
00:17:57,285 --> 00:18:00,372
You know, maybe what's
wrong with him...

219
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,583
is that he is.
Is what?

220
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,877
From the planet K-PAX.

221
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:45,083
Mmm.

222
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:52,132
Your produce alone
has been worth the trip.

223
00:18:57,220 --> 00:19:00,640
Could you tell me...

224
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,935
a bit about your boyhood
on K-PAX?

225
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:05,937
Where were you born?

226
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:11,067
You were, uh,
born, right?

227
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,069
K-PAXians have babies?

228
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,697
Oh, yes, much like on Earth,
but unlike you humans,

229
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:19,451
the reproductive process
is quite unpleasant for us.

230
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:21,911
Could you compare
the effect to something
that I might understand?

231
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:24,998
Like a toothache?
It's more like having
your nuts in a vise,

232
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,000
except we feel it all over.

233
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,502
And to make matters worse,
the sensation is associated...

234
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:33,131
with something like your nausea,
accompanied by a very bad smell.

235
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,468
The moment of climax is like
being kicked in the stomach,

236
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:39,554
and then falling into a pool
of mod droppings.

237
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,514
Mod droppings?

238
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:46,353
A mod is a being,
much like your skunk,
only far more potent.

239
00:19:48,772 --> 00:19:52,442
Uh, if it's such
a terrible experience,

240
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:56,738
uh, how do you reproduce?

241
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:59,491
As carefully as possible.

242
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,534
What are you doing?

243
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:05,455
Well, you just reminded me
of something I want to
include in my report.

244
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:07,665
Your report.
Yes, it's our custom...

245
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:10,543
to compile descriptions
of the various places
and people we encounter...

246
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:12,587
throughout the galaxy.

247
00:20:17,217 --> 00:20:20,178
Morning, Betty.
Good morning, Prot.

248
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,430
Morning, Navarro.
Hey, what's up, man?

249
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,100
Mr. Friedman.
Morning, Maria.

250
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:29,521
- I'm Vanessa.
- Just chill.

251
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:32,857
Morning, Bess.

252
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:33,733
Morning, Bess.

253
00:20:33,858 --> 00:20:39,030
She doesn't talk to anybody.
Afraid smoke will come out of
her mouth when she talks.

254
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:41,950
Been here since
she was a little girl.
Burned her house down.

255
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:45,078
Shouldn't play with matches.
Very dangerous.

256
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:49,582
It was an electrical fire.
Why do you make up stories
like that?

257
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:52,085
Ernie has a very powerful
imagination.

258
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:57,632
Philistine!

259
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:02,637
Come on, Doris.
You gotta come out of
Your room sometime.

260
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:04,764
Look what I brought
just for you.

261
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,977
Pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh,
pooh, pooh, pooh, pooh.

262
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,396
Do that again,
you go up to three.

263
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:17,068
Her Royal Highness never,
ever comes out of her room.
Not even to eat.

264
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,320
No wonder she's here.
I'm sick and tired
of this shit.

265
00:21:19,446 --> 00:21:22,407
Everyday, coming up here
and shooting food at me.
I hate this.

266
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,960
The service here
is atrocious!

267
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:39,299
Good morning, Mrs. Archer.
Doris.

268
00:21:41,718 --> 00:21:45,096
I wasn't expecting
any gentleman callers...

269
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,432
until this afternoon.

270
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:49,434
Excuse me.

271
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,200
You have a place
set for two.

272
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:12,624
Oh, yes. Um...
I'm expecting someone.

273
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,709
How long
have you been waiting?

274
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,795
Eleven years.

275
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:24,010
For some around here
might...

276
00:22:24,094 --> 00:22:27,180
call that crazy,
but I prefer to call it...

277
00:22:27,305 --> 00:22:29,683
romantic.

278
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:32,811
Romantic.
Like a, uh...

279
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,815
waltz in the moonlight,
or a...

280
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,651
candlelit dinner...

281
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:42,153
or a sunset.
Oh, we have those.

282
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,031
On K-PAX, we have two suns.

283
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:49,160
They rise together
only once every 200 years.

284
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:51,246
And that is quite a sight.

285
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:57,377
He most definitely
has a sensitivity
to white light,

286
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:01,464
but I think
it's his range that
You'll find interesting.

287
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:03,383
What am I looking at?

288
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:07,554
He can detect light
at a wavelength of up to
300 to 400 angstroms.

289
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,016
Ultraviolet.

290
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:14,019
Of course,
Prot's explanation is that...

291
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:18,481
due to his planet's
peculiar quality of light
caused by its two suns,

292
00:23:18,565 --> 00:23:24,029
K-PAXians are used to
light conditions much like
our twilight most of the time.

293
00:23:24,154 --> 00:23:26,114
W-Wait a minute.
Chuck, I didn't think...

294
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:28,199
human beings could see
ultraviolet light.

295
00:23:28,283 --> 00:23:30,118
We can't.

296
00:23:47,761 --> 00:23:49,637
Good morning, Joyce.

297
00:23:49,763 --> 00:23:53,058
That's a lovely configuration
You're wearing today.
Thank you.

298
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,603
Macy's.
Come in.

299
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,825
This is so much better.

300
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,412
It's a lot like home.

301
00:24:27,884 --> 00:24:30,387
Well, uh, Prot,

302
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,348
I was hoping you'd tell me
more about home.

303
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:37,686
Well, what would you
like to know?

304
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,940
Well, uh, do you, um,

305
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,528
do you have a family
on K-PAX?

306
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:49,447
It doesn't work on K-PAX
the same way it works
here, Mark.

307
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,784
On K-PAX, we don't
have families in the way
that you think of them.

308
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:57,330
In fact, a family would be
a non sequitur on our planet,
as it would on most others.

309
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,792
In other words, um,

310
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:05,630
You, uh, you never knew
Your parents.

311
00:25:05,714 --> 00:25:10,010
On K-PAX, children are not
raised by their biological
parents, Mark, but by everyone.

312
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,346
They circulate among us,
learning from one
and then another.

313
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:16,349
Do you have a child?
No.

314
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,021
Do you have a wife waiting
back for you on K-PAX?

315
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:23,023
Mark. Mark. Mark.

316
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:29,154
You are not really listening
to what I'm saying to you,
are you?

317
00:25:31,364 --> 00:25:33,241
We do not have marriage
on K-PAX.

318
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,702
There are no wives.
There are no husbands.

319
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:38,496
There are no families.

320
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:45,712
I see. So, um,

321
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:49,758
what about...
societal structure?

322
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,385
Government.
No, there's
no need for one.

323
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:56,556
- You have no laws?
- No laws. No lawyers.

324
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:59,392
How do you know
right from wrong?

325
00:25:59,517 --> 00:26:03,271
Every being
in the universe knows
right from wrong, Mark.

326
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,277
But what if--

327
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:12,822
if someone did do
something wrong--

328
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:17,035
committed murder or rape--

329
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,204
how would you punish them?

330
00:26:22,582 --> 00:26:25,001
Let me tell you
something, Mark.

331
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,712
You humans, most of you,

332
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,548
subscribe to this policy
of "an eye for an eye,

333
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:33,051
a life for a life,"
which is known
throughout the universe...

334
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,053
for its stupidity.

335
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,681
Even your Buddha and your Christ
had quite a different vision,

336
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:41,518
but nobody's paid much attention
to them, not even the Buddhists
or the Christians.

337
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:46,731
You humans,

338
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:50,276
sometimes it's hard to imagine
how you've made it this far.

339
00:27:01,162 --> 00:27:03,748
Josh, be careful.

340
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,293
Okay, kids. Let's go.
The hot dogs are ready.

341
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:14,134
Hey. Where were you
just now?

342
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:17,804
Come on.
Okay.

343
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:23,101
Hey, kids, come on.
Wash up.

344
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:24,853
Okay!

345
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,816
Josh. Now come on,
quit teasing the dog.

346
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,152
Josh, let's go.
Settle down now.

347
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:35,947
- Here we are.
- Oh, park that right here.

348
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,325
Boy,
that looks terrific.
That looks great.

349
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:41,119
Steve, how was, uh,
how was your trip
up from Princeton?

350
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,538
Steve, how was, uh,
how was your trip
up from Princeton?

351
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:47,334
Not too bad.
We even stopped by
to see Michael.

352
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:49,627
Oh, that was
nice of you, Sis.

353
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:51,713
Quite a detour
for you guys.

354
00:27:51,838 --> 00:27:54,049
Well, it was his birthday.

355
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,634
I know it was his birthday.

356
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,512
I sent him a card
and a nice, uh,

357
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,514
a nice, big check
as usual.

358
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,642
It wouldn't kill you
to pick up the phone
every once in a while...

359
00:28:04,726 --> 00:28:06,644
and talk to your own son.

360
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:10,690
Thank you, Abby.
You wanna pass
the potato salad, please?

361
00:28:11,775 --> 00:28:13,693
There you go.

362
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:17,197
By the way, I put him
through Dartmouth. He knows
how to pick up a phone too.

363
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:20,700
I'm thinking of inviting him
for Christmas.
Oh, great.

364
00:28:20,825 --> 00:28:24,329
He spends Christmas
with his mother.

365
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:27,707
He won't come here.
How do you know? When was
the last time you asked him?

366
00:28:27,832 --> 00:28:30,085
Am I on the couch here,
or what?

367
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:32,754
You want a beer?
Please and thank you.

368
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:34,756
You want some more?
Can I have corn, darling?

369
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,681
Steve, I, uh,

370
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:45,225
I have a rather unusual
favor to ask you.

371
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,894
What can I do you for,
Dr. "P"?
Well, I have a patient.

372
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:50,855
Sit down. I have
this patient, who, uh,

373
00:28:50,939 --> 00:28:52,857
seems to know quite
a bit about your field.

374
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,235
A patient
who's an astronomer?

375
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,029
So, tell me about
this patient of yours.

376
00:28:58,154 --> 00:29:03,201
Well, he, uh, he claims
to come from a planet
he calls K-PAX.

377
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,745
What kind of name
is that?
K-PAX?

378
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:11,209
He says it's a thousand
light-years away, near
the constellation Lyra.

379
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:14,754
Uh-huh. Bighead?
Green? About this high?

380
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:16,965
Yeah, I think
I know the guy.

381
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,926
No, he's, uh,
he's very convincing.

382
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,726
I mean, of course,
he's, uh, he's human.

383
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:29,728
It’s just that he's, um,

384
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,982
well, he's-he's the most
convincing delusional
I've ever come across.

385
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:38,611
If I can prove to him
that this K-PAX is just
a figment of his imagination,

386
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:41,906
then maybe I can find out
who he really is.

387
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,909
Well, sure.
I can give you...

388
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,454
a whole list of questions
to ask your fella.
Wonderful.

389
00:29:49,622 --> 00:29:52,125
All his books and papers
and everything...

390
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:57,172
are spread all over the desk
like always, but he's
just sitting there.

391
00:29:57,297 --> 00:29:59,174
Someone change
his medication?

392
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:03,136
I gave him his usual,
Anafronil, 250 milligrams.

393
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,685
Hmm. Well, something's
wrong with him.

394
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:15,774
An obsessive-compulsive
doesn't just sit there
looking out the window.

395
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,159
Howie?

396
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:33,500
Good morning,
Dr. Powell.

397
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:38,004
Good morning.
But are you looking
for something?

398
00:30:38,088 --> 00:30:40,006
Bluebird.

399
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,133
The bluebird?

400
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,177
The bluebird of happiness.

401
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,641
Prot told me to find
the bluebird of happiness.

402
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:52,394
Prot told you.

403
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:54,396
It's a task.

404
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:56,398
The first of three.

405
00:30:58,358 --> 00:31:01,194
I don't know what
the other two are yet.

406
00:31:01,319 --> 00:31:03,988
He'll tell me.

407
00:31:04,072 --> 00:31:08,076
If I complete all three,

408
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,078
I'll be cured.

409
00:31:22,048 --> 00:31:25,010
There.
Maintain your breathing.

410
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:27,554
That's it.
Now you see?

411
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:30,098
There are none of
these ammonia particles
that you're so worried about.

412
00:31:30,223 --> 00:31:33,226
In the first place,
I would be able to see them.
Good morning, Sal.

413
00:31:33,351 --> 00:31:35,228
And I don't.
Good morning, Dr. Stinky.

414
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:37,856
Ringed monkey, 7:00.

415
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,279
Take a bath.
Take a bath.

416
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,866
Ernie, could you excuse us
for a moment, please?
Mm-hmm.

417
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,909
Good to, uh,
see you outside, Ernie.

418
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:53,204
Thank you.
Oh, Ernie, you stink.

419
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:56,583
Prot, it's one thing
to take an interest
in your fellow patients.

420
00:31:56,708 --> 00:31:59,711
It's quite another
to make them think
that you can cure them.

421
00:31:59,794 --> 00:32:01,755
You seem overly upset,
Mark.

422
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,383
To borrow a phrase from Navarro,
You need to chill.

423
00:32:05,508 --> 00:32:08,720
For your information,
all beings have the capacity
to cure themselves, Mark.

424
00:32:08,803 --> 00:32:11,514
This is something
we've known on K-PAX
for millions of years.

425
00:32:11,598 --> 00:32:15,727
Listen to me.
On this planet,
I'm a doctor, you're a patient.

426
00:32:15,852 --> 00:32:19,647
Doctor. Patient.
Curious human distinction.

427
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:22,692
It's not your job
to cure Howie.

428
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:25,779
Or Ernie or Maria
or anyone else.
It's mine.

429
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:27,947
Then why haven't
You cured them yet?

430
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:34,662
Oh, by the way,
here are the answers
to the questions you asked me.

431
00:32:37,582 --> 00:32:39,459
I hope they meet
Your satisfaction.

432
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:56,101
I don't know what to say, Mark.

433
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:59,896
I mean, this is--
this is pretty wild stuff.

434
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,983
Gibberish, huh?
Well, not exactly.

435
00:33:04,109 --> 00:33:06,361
I mean, see,

436
00:33:06,486 --> 00:33:09,322
Your patient indicates
his planet, K-PAX,

437
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:13,451
orbiting an eclipsing
binary star system--
Agape and Satori.

438
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,287
Yeah.
Near the Constellation Lyra.

439
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:18,498
He could have
looked that up, right?

440
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,669
That's the funny thing, Mark.
Not really.

441
00:33:22,794 --> 00:33:26,673
I mean, except for my boss,
Duncan Flynn,

442
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,634
one of the foremost
astrophysicists in the world...

443
00:33:29,718 --> 00:33:34,055
and maybe two or three
of his colleagues,

444
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,434
nobody knows much about
the possibility of planets
in this star system yet.

445
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:39,978
It hasn't even been reported
in any journals.

446
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,857
Tell me, honestly,

447
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:45,984
did Duncan put you
up to this?

448
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,695
You know--
You know, like a joke?

449
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,490
No. It's no joke, Steve.

450
00:33:52,615 --> 00:33:54,826
Uh, tell me,

451
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,204
do you know of any missing
astrophysicists?

452
00:33:58,329 --> 00:34:01,791
Can't say I do.

453
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:05,503
But there's one or two
around here who'd sure like
to meet this fella of yours.

454
00:34:05,587 --> 00:34:08,089
Thanks a lot, Steve.
I sure appreciate it.

455
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,931
But unlike you humans,
the reproductive process...

456
00:34:17,057 --> 00:34:18,975
is an unpleasant one for us.
Start again.

457
00:34:19,017 --> 00:34:22,812
What way is it unpleasant?

458
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:24,731
It's a pain--

459
00:34:34,366 --> 00:34:38,787
Good. Not too fast.
Okay.

460
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,794
So, this is
Your neighbourhood, huh?

461
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,764
Hello, gentlemen.
Sure appreciate you
meeting with us.

462
00:37:02,889 --> 00:37:06,059
Thank you, Dr. Powell.
We'd like to get to the bottom
of this just as much as you.

463
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:10,271
Thank you, Doctor.
Great. Let me introduce
You to Prot.

464
00:37:12,399 --> 00:37:15,402
It's a pleasure
to meet you, Prot.
I'm Dr. Becker.

465
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:18,029
This is Dr. Flynn.

466
00:37:18,113 --> 00:37:20,573
Drs. Patel and Hessler.

467
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:26,871
Doctor. Doctor.
Doctor. Doctor.

468
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,458
How many doctors
are there on this planet?

469
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,146
Here, Prot.
Have a seat.

470
00:37:51,271 --> 00:37:54,399
"Have a seat."
Oh, shit!

471
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,903
Feel at home?

472
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:05,952
We found your notes
quite interesting, Prot,

473
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:09,205
and we'd like to ask you
some questions,
if that's all right.

474
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,459
Be my guest.
Good.
Then I’ll jump right in.

475
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:14,836
Make sure you can swim.

476
00:38:14,961 --> 00:38:17,297
Yes, well,

477
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,925
let's start with this idea
of light travel, shall we?

478
00:38:22,552 --> 00:38:24,596
What can you tell us
about that?

479
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:28,475
Absolutely nothing.

480
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,061
If I told you,
you'd blow yourselves up.

481
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,104
Or worse,
someone else.

482
00:38:33,188 --> 00:38:36,274
You'd be surprised
how much energy
is in a beam of light.

483
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:39,444
Hmm. Well, then,

484
00:38:39,569 --> 00:38:44,199
maybe you could show us
how this light travel works.

485
00:38:47,118 --> 00:38:48,995
You mean a demonstration.

486
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:51,790
That would be... fine.

487
00:39:03,385 --> 00:39:05,303
Adios. Aloha.

488
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:12,352
Well, when are you gonna--
I'm already back.

489
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,984
See, where I come from, Prot,
that's called "the fastest gun
in the West" routine.

490
00:39:20,068 --> 00:39:23,530
Well, I don't come from
where you come from,
Dr. Becker.

491
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:29,202
Prot, you've indicated in your
notes that your planet K-PAX...

492
00:39:29,285 --> 00:39:33,206
orbits around the twin stars
of Agape and Satori,
near the constellation Lyra.

493
00:39:33,331 --> 00:39:35,208
Well, frankly,
we're a bit mystified...

494
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:39,379
as to how you gained knowledge
there's such a planetary system
around these stars.

495
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:42,215
Professor, where I come from,
that's common knowledge.

496
00:39:44,217 --> 00:39:47,345
This was taken
from the Hubble.

497
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:52,350
We've computer enhanced it,
based on Dr. Patel's readings...

498
00:39:52,475 --> 00:39:54,686
from telescopes
in Chile and Hawaii.

499
00:39:54,769 --> 00:39:59,566
It's the clearest picture
we have of where you come from.

500
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:06,281
What we'd like is if you could
diagram on the light pad...

501
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:10,035
the orbital pattern
that your planet takes
through this system.

502
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,043
Mm-hmm.
My pleasure.

503
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:18,353
I think that's right.

504
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,774
Steven,
could you input that?

505
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:24,442
Already on it.

506
00:41:27,987 --> 00:41:30,156
Wh-What's going on?

507
00:41:59,227 --> 00:42:02,772
I take it my calculations
help explain the "protabations"
You've been seeing...

508
00:42:02,856 --> 00:42:05,692
in the rotation pattern
of your binary star,

509
00:42:05,817 --> 00:42:11,031
but have been unable to explain
until... this moment.

510
00:42:20,665 --> 00:42:22,542
How--

511
00:42:22,667 --> 00:42:24,711
How could you know this?

512
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:28,798
How could you--

513
00:42:28,882 --> 00:42:31,051
Every K-PAXian knows this.

514
00:42:32,552 --> 00:42:34,679
Just as every child
on Earth knows...

515
00:42:34,804 --> 00:42:38,224
that your planet
revolves around your sun.

516
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,685
It's common knowledge.
Isn't it?

517
00:42:57,702 --> 00:43:01,748
What, um,
what happened in there?

518
00:43:01,873 --> 00:43:03,750
I mean, you--

519
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,836
He could be a savant.

520
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,548
There-There are savants
who have painted flawless
copies of Rembrandt,

521
00:43:10,674 --> 00:43:14,469
who couldn't--
who couldn't remember
their own names.

522
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:18,890
You don't
believe him, Steve.

523
00:43:22,102 --> 00:43:25,730
I don't know
what I believe, Mark,
but I know what I saw.

524
00:43:34,406 --> 00:43:37,909
I moved. I moved.
It's your move.

525
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:40,995
One and two. Your move.

526
00:43:47,961 --> 00:43:49,838
Bluebird.

527
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:55,093
Bluebird.

528
00:43:55,176 --> 00:43:57,095
You just wait
till next game.
Bluebird.

529
00:43:59,222 --> 00:44:02,642
Bluebird! Bluebird!

530
00:44:03,768 --> 00:44:07,313
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

531
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:10,525
Howie!
Bluebird! Bluebird!

532
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,029
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

533
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:17,115
Howie.
Bluebird. Bluebird.
Bluebird.

534
00:44:17,198 --> 00:44:19,659
Okay. Okay.
Bluebird!

535
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:21,661
Where's the bluebird?

536
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:24,706
Look, bluebird!
Bluebird! Bluebird!

537
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:26,791
Oh, my God.

538
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:34,007
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Howie!
Howie, get back here!

539
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:37,844
Bluebird! Bluebird!
Bluebird!

540
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:39,929
Do bluebirds bite, Sal?

541
00:44:40,013 --> 00:44:42,682
Nah, they don't bite,
stinkhead.

542
00:44:46,311 --> 00:44:49,522
Hey, Bess, it’s a bluebird.

543
00:44:52,525 --> 00:44:55,070
- Shit!
- Disturbance on two.

544
00:44:57,781 --> 00:45:01,659
- It's the bluebird!
- Bluebird! Bluebird!

545
00:45:01,743 --> 00:45:03,912
Bluebird! Bluebird!

546
00:45:14,673 --> 00:45:16,549
Bluebird! Bluebird!

547
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:23,264
It's mass hysteria.

548
00:45:23,390 --> 00:45:27,602
Betty!
Betty, what the hell
is going on here?

549
00:45:27,727 --> 00:45:31,272
- Come here! Come here!
- Dr. Powell, come and see!

550
00:45:31,398 --> 00:45:36,069
You see it?
Do you see it?

551
00:45:36,194 --> 00:45:38,905
Lookit! Lookit!
Lookit!

552
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:43,201
What’s going on here,
Dr. Powell?
What on Earth is out there?

553
00:45:43,284 --> 00:45:46,788
-Just a bluejay.
- A bluejay?

554
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:54,045
A bluejay.

555
00:45:55,588 --> 00:45:57,757
Off the chair.
Everybody, get off the chairs.

556
00:45:57,882 --> 00:46:01,928
Mrs. Archer...
come out of her room.

557
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,977
Bluebird?

558
00:46:13,273 --> 00:46:15,150
It’s a bluebird?

559
00:46:16,943 --> 00:46:18,820
Come on over here.

560
00:47:00,945 --> 00:47:03,907
I know who you are.

561
00:47:06,701 --> 00:47:09,537
You're the bluebird.

562
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:17,545
Good night, Bess.

563
00:47:23,259 --> 00:47:26,096
And how are we today?
Oh, just fine.

564
00:47:26,179 --> 00:47:29,307
That's good, Maria.
My man.

565
00:47:37,315 --> 00:47:38,692
Psst.

566
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:53,498
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.

567
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,717
About that
light travel thing.

568
00:48:03,842 --> 00:48:07,220
I was wondering if maybe
You could show me
how to do that.

569
00:48:12,434 --> 00:48:16,688
I put up with
the stinkin this place
for ten years.

570
00:48:16,771 --> 00:48:19,899
I wanna get out,
if you know what I mean.

571
00:48:21,067 --> 00:48:24,696
I used to be the doorman
at The Plaza.

572
00:48:24,779 --> 00:48:26,906
F-Fifteen years.

573
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:29,367
That's when I started
to notice it.

574
00:48:30,577 --> 00:48:33,913
Notice what?
The smell.

575
00:48:34,039 --> 00:48:36,332
They all stank.

576
00:48:36,416 --> 00:48:40,920
I-I tried to tell 'em,
but, uh,

577
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:43,381
they put me here.

578
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:45,925
And, um, and-and--

579
00:48:47,594 --> 00:48:51,723
And this-this place
smells worse than all.

580
00:48:51,848 --> 00:48:54,517
Except for you.
Y-You don't smell,

581
00:48:54,601 --> 00:48:57,771
so I figured maybe
You could help me.

582
00:49:00,106 --> 00:49:04,361
You should smell
the york blossoms
on my planet...

583
00:49:04,444 --> 00:49:06,738
in a gentle breeze.

584
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:10,283
Pretty much
like your sugarplums.

585
00:49:10,367 --> 00:49:13,286
I would-- I would
like to smell that.

586
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:19,584
I would like to go there,
to-to your, um,

587
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:21,586
planet.

588
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:25,757
I'm afraid I can only take
one person back with me
when I go.

589
00:49:29,594 --> 00:49:33,431
Uh, I had my weekly session
with Sal today.

590
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:35,433
He says you're
taking him to K-PAX.

591
00:49:35,558 --> 00:49:38,436
In fact, I've heard
from most of the patients
on ward two,

592
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:41,272
they all tell me
that they're going to K-PAX.

593
00:49:41,398 --> 00:49:44,818
I wonder if that’s a wise thing
to be promising patients
in a psychiatric facility.

594
00:49:44,943 --> 00:49:48,029
No, no, no, Mark.
I made it clear to each
and every one of them,

595
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:50,824
I can only take one person
back with me when I return.

596
00:49:50,907 --> 00:49:53,785
Return?
Mark,
don't get me wrong.

597
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:56,746
I mean, you've been
very hospitable.

598
00:49:56,871 --> 00:49:59,874
Hospital.
Hospitable.

599
00:49:59,999 --> 00:50:03,545
But my time here is almost up,
and I can't wait to get back.
Back?

600
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:06,214
To K-PAX?
Yes, of course.
Where else?

601
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:08,258
You're planning
to return to K-PAX.

602
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:11,553
You're repeating yourself
again, Mark. Yes, I have
one trip to take up north,

603
00:50:11,678 --> 00:50:14,139
and then I am planning
on returning to K-PAX.

604
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:16,891
Joyce gave me these strawberries
this morning from her garden
in Hoboken.

605
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:20,437
They're delicious.
You'll have to
forgive me, but, um,

606
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,731
but this is
a bit confusing.

607
00:50:22,814 --> 00:50:25,859
- When are you planning on--
- I'm departing on July 27.

608
00:50:25,942 --> 00:50:30,071
Why? Why, uh,
why July 27?

609
00:50:30,196 --> 00:50:32,115
Safety reasons.

610
00:50:32,198 --> 00:50:34,951
You see, I can go anywhere
on Earth without fear
of bumping into someone...

611
00:50:35,076 --> 00:50:39,080
travelling at super light speed,
but beings are coming and going
all the time from K-PAX.

612
00:50:39,205 --> 00:50:41,541
It has to be coordinated.

613
00:50:43,668 --> 00:50:45,587
You're telling me...

614
00:50:45,670 --> 00:50:49,507
You're beaming back
to K-PAX on July 27.

615
00:50:49,632 --> 00:50:52,719
At 5:51 a.m.,
Eastern time.

616
00:51:13,073 --> 00:51:15,784
Hey, hey, hey, honey.

617
00:51:15,909 --> 00:51:18,661
Mark,
You were just dreaming.

618
00:51:18,787 --> 00:51:20,872
You were just dreaming.

619
00:51:26,169 --> 00:51:28,129
Daddy?
Mark.

620
00:51:28,213 --> 00:51:30,131
Mark, what’s going on?
Daddy's okay.

621
00:51:30,215 --> 00:51:32,133
Go back to bed, honey.
Where is Daddy going?

622
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:34,135
Daddy's all right.
He has a tummy ache.
He's all right.

623
00:51:34,219 --> 00:51:36,137
Daddy!
Get in bed!

624
00:51:36,221 --> 00:51:38,431
And when did you arrive
on Earth?

625
00:51:38,515 --> 00:51:40,517
Four years and nine months ago.
What's going on?

626
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,187
Shh! Listen.

627
00:51:44,312 --> 00:51:46,439
And when did you arrive
on Earth?

628
00:51:46,523 --> 00:51:48,441
Four years and nine months ago.

629
00:51:48,525 --> 00:51:50,485
Your years.

630
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:55,448
Four years, nine months
and three days ago.

631
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:59,452
That'll be five years
to the date on July 27.
That's when he's leaving.

632
00:51:59,536 --> 00:52:02,580
What?
To go back to K-PAX.

633
00:52:02,706 --> 00:52:05,125
Mark, what is the matter
with you?

634
00:52:05,208 --> 00:52:07,127
Rachel--
Mark, it is 2:00
in the morning.

635
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,129
What is-- What is
this patient doing to you?

636
00:52:09,212 --> 00:52:11,798
He's telling me
that five years ago
on July 27...

637
00:52:11,881 --> 00:52:13,800
something terrible
happened to him.

638
00:52:13,883 --> 00:52:18,263
Some horrible trauma.
I gotta get to him
before that date.

639
00:52:18,388 --> 00:52:21,182
- Mom, what's happening?
- Unbelievable.

640
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,685
Nothing. Come on.
Come on. Let's all
go back to bed.

641
00:52:24,936 --> 00:52:27,981
Ah, I've got it!

642
00:52:28,064 --> 00:52:29,983
Come on. Let's eat.

643
00:52:32,777 --> 00:52:35,864
- Is the spaceman here yet?
- Shh. Don't call him that.

644
00:52:35,989 --> 00:52:38,783
Spaceman. Spaceman.
No, no. No, no.

645
00:52:38,908 --> 00:52:41,536
Whoo!
Everybody, come here.

646
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:43,705
Listen, everybody, look.
He's going to be here
any minute.

647
00:52:43,830 --> 00:52:47,584
I want you guys to just
calm down. Be yourselves.
Act natural.

648
00:52:47,709 --> 00:52:50,170
Okay. Spaceman.

649
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:54,049
Why, is he going to zap us
with his laser gun?

650
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:56,801
I mean it. I do.
Here.

651
00:52:56,926 --> 00:52:59,012
Oh, Mom.

652
00:52:59,095 --> 00:53:01,014
I can't believe
I agreed to this.

653
00:53:01,097 --> 00:53:03,016
I tried everything else.
Rachel, look.

654
00:53:03,099 --> 00:53:05,477
I want him to spend
Fourth of July with us...

655
00:53:05,602 --> 00:53:08,146
to see if a normal family
environment might bring
something out of him.

656
00:53:08,271 --> 00:53:10,231
Since when did we become
a normal family?

657
00:53:10,315 --> 00:53:13,526
Please.
Look. They're here.

658
00:53:13,610 --> 00:53:16,237
I just feel uncomfortable.
Well, don't.

659
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:18,782
Joyce's son, he's on
the high school wrestling team,

660
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,909
and Betty's husband's
an ex-cop.

661
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:23,912
Hey!
Hi.

662
00:53:23,995 --> 00:53:26,539
Hey, Joyce.
Hey, buddy.

663
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,417
Glad you could make it.

664
00:53:29,501 --> 00:53:32,087
Wow.
This is my husband, Dominic.

665
00:53:32,170 --> 00:53:34,923
He looks like Data.
That's right,
embarrass him.

666
00:53:35,006 --> 00:53:37,092
Welcome, Prot.

667
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,886
This is my wife Rachel.

668
00:53:43,682 --> 00:53:47,352
How do you do?
Rachel.

669
00:53:47,477 --> 00:53:49,938
Thank you so much
for inviting me today.

670
00:53:50,021 --> 00:53:51,856
Thanks for coming.

671
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,361
- Watch out. Watch out.
- No.

672
00:53:56,486 --> 00:54:00,907
Shasta, no.
Shasta, no.
Shasta!

673
00:54:00,990 --> 00:54:04,369
Come here, good dog.
I know. I know.

674
00:54:04,494 --> 00:54:07,247
Damn dog's
never liked anyone.
Shh.

675
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,709
Oh. Okay. Kids.

676
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:15,088
Girls. Girls.
Come here.

677
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:28,101
Okay.

678
00:54:28,184 --> 00:54:31,187
She says she doesn't
like it when you hide
her favorite tennis shoe.

679
00:54:31,312 --> 00:54:34,149
And she doesn't hear so well
in her left side, so--

680
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,192
so don't sneak up
on her anymore.

681
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:39,404
No way.

682
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,661
Let's get some lunch, okay?
Let's have lunch.

683
00:54:52,876 --> 00:54:54,753
Let's go eat.

684
00:55:04,054 --> 00:55:07,474
It’s good, Rachel.

685
00:55:07,557 --> 00:55:09,559
Okay, you guys, come on.

686
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:12,020
Careful, careful,
Gabby.

687
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:17,233
All right. Come on.
Somebody else
want some?

688
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:19,819
There we go.

689
00:55:21,821 --> 00:55:24,824
So, Prot, Mark tells me
You don't eat meat.

690
00:55:24,908 --> 00:55:26,951
That's very healthy.
Speak for yourself.

691
00:55:27,077 --> 00:55:29,037
Burger.
Burger.

692
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:31,081
You got it?

693
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:33,958
Yes, I want burgers,
thank you.
It's good.

694
00:55:34,084 --> 00:55:37,379
Everything looks so good.
Pass me one of those hamburgers.

695
00:55:39,589 --> 00:55:42,092
Come on.

696
00:55:58,358 --> 00:56:00,276
Give me a push.

697
00:57:39,668 --> 00:57:44,047
There's a photograph
on the piano of a young man
with all the others.

698
00:57:44,172 --> 00:57:46,049
That's Michael.

699
00:57:46,174 --> 00:57:48,843
That's Mark's son
from his first marriage.

700
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:51,888
How many marriages
has he had?

701
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:55,892
Just the two...
so far.

702
00:57:57,811 --> 00:57:59,688
"So far?
No, I mean,

703
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:02,023
he's not out to set
a world record or anything.

704
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,736
But the young man
in the photograph,
he's not here today.

705
00:58:09,197 --> 00:58:11,366
No, um,
he doesn't live with us.

706
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:13,618
You know,
he's away at college and--

707
00:58:13,743 --> 00:58:18,123
and the truth is,
he and Mark don't
talk to each other.

708
00:58:20,250 --> 00:58:22,585
I don't know why
I'm telling you this.

709
00:58:22,711 --> 00:58:25,922
Probably because
I'm a locked-up lunatic,
so what harm could it do.

710
00:58:26,047 --> 00:58:29,384
Maybe.

711
00:58:31,177 --> 00:58:33,096
Maybe that's it.

712
00:58:36,224 --> 00:58:39,352
Dr. Powell's been trying
to teach me the importance...

713
00:58:39,436 --> 00:58:43,273
You beings place on
Your biological connections.
Hmm.

714
00:58:44,524 --> 00:58:46,443
You think he means it?

715
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:50,613
You don't?

716
00:58:55,410 --> 00:58:57,287
Do you know
what a family is?

717
00:58:58,788 --> 00:59:01,708
You worry.

718
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:05,253
They don't
tell you that, you know.

719
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,217
You don't have a family.

720
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,097
No.

721
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:22,020
We don't have families
on K-PAX.

722
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:28,526
Well, you don't know
what you're missing.

723
00:59:34,616 --> 00:59:36,493
I'll get you
some more lemonade.

724
00:59:42,999 --> 00:59:46,461
# Hula, hula #
All right.
Incoming.

725
00:59:46,544 --> 00:59:50,131
That's beautiful.
Thank you.

726
00:59:50,256 --> 00:59:52,967
Fourth of July.

727
00:59:53,093 --> 00:59:56,304
Thank you for inviting me
here today, Mark.

728
00:59:56,429 --> 00:59:58,390
You're most welcome, Prot.

729
01:00:00,684 --> 01:00:02,894
Come push me on the swing!

730
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:06,815
I'll show you
a trick.

731
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,817
This is called...

732
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:10,902
Go to the Table
and Have a Beer.
