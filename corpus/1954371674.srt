1
00:00:15,681 --> 00:00:21,290
<i>So we met at a party,
and it was magic.</i>

2
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:25,857
<i>Within a half hour,</i>

3
00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:28,526
<i>we were driving up into
this really nice neighborhood,</i>

4
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:32,363
<i>and we were
running down the stairs</i>

5
00:00:32,364 --> 00:00:34,265
<i>of some stranger's backyard,</i>

6
00:00:34,266 --> 00:00:41,642
<i>and then we were swimming
and we were in love.</i>

7
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:46,411
<i>What we didn't count on
was that even though the lights were off,</i>

8
00:00:46,412 --> 00:00:48,980
<i>the owner of the home was there,</i>

9
00:00:48,981 --> 00:00:51,116
<i>and he came out screaming at us,</i>

10
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:53,418
<i>and it was the greatest
night of my life.</i>

11
00:00:53,419 --> 00:00:54,521
Ready?

12
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:58,523
So my idea was, you know,

13
00:00:58,524 --> 00:01:02,468
let's try
and re-create that moment.

14
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:10,802
Oh, it's freezing!

15
00:01:10,803 --> 00:01:14,306
It's a little colder
than I remember it.

16
00:01:16,315 --> 00:01:17,842
Do you think he's coming out?

17
00:01:17,843 --> 00:01:20,711
I'm sure. I'm sure he
heard us, right?

18
00:01:20,712 --> 00:01:24,351
Hello?
This is fun.

19
00:01:25,351 --> 00:01:26,484
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,485 --> 00:01:27,485
Where is he?

21
00:01:29,421 --> 00:01:30,474
Maybe he's not home.

22
00:01:33,358 --> 00:01:36,360
Happy anniversary anyway.

23
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,102
Happy anniversary.

24
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,804
<i>When we were in the
water and we were waiting</i>

25
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:49,641
<i>and no one came out,
no one was home,</i>

26
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,476
<i>and we were just floating there,</i>

27
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,849
<i>I felt sad,</i>

28
00:01:57,849 --> 00:02:02,220
and I felt like our happiness
used to be so easy

29
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:04,622
and there used to be
so much of it,

30
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:07,892
and now I feel like
happiness is something

31
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:10,497
that we have to re-create.

32
00:02:14,584 --> 00:02:16,900
I'm sorry. I tried to make
a romantic moment.

33
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:18,636
I'll never take you
to a fucking pool again.

34
00:02:18,637 --> 00:02:20,512
Oh, come on.
Don't do that.

35
00:02:26,512 --> 00:02:27,711
Okay.

36
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,979
This could be fun.

37
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,448
We're going to do a
compatibility exercise.

38
00:02:31,449 --> 00:02:35,820
I want you both to play a note
at the same time, okay?

39
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:36,821
Just any note?

40
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:39,091
Yep. Knock yourself out.

41
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,596
Wow! You guys are not in sync,
are you?

42
00:02:44,597 --> 00:02:45,797
We used to be great.

43
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:47,565
We used to be
really irreverent and...

44
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:48,566
Yeah. There was
teasing...

45
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:49,667
Yeah. and stuff. Like I...

46
00:02:49,668 --> 00:02:51,035
I mean no offense...

47
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:52,036
but I would call you a
bitch and it was funny.

48
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,437
Yeah, it was hilarious.

49
00:02:53,438 --> 00:02:54,308
I used to call you a bitch.

50
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,540
You thought it was really funny.

51
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,874
Yeah.

52
00:02:56,875 --> 00:02:58,710
I just don't know how
we're going to move forward

53
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,811
if we keep having
this circular conversation

54
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:03,781
about me doing what I did

55
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:05,516
which I have
apologized for already,

56
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:08,386
and we are here because
we are trying to move on.

57
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:10,787
I don't see why we have to
keep revisiting that

58
00:03:10,788 --> 00:03:13,291
- because it's the same conversation
- over and over again.

59
00:03:13,292 --> 00:03:15,493
- Because you don't get
- to decide that, Ethan.

60
00:03:15,494 --> 00:03:17,829
You don't get to decide
when we move on, I do.

61
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:20,470
So, you guys having sex?

62
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,537
Now if you'd played this one,
Sophie...

63
00:03:27,538 --> 00:03:29,740
...or that one...
...that's pretty, right?

64
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:32,812
But this...
...not so much.

65
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,614
Anyway, it's just an exercise.

66
00:03:36,615 --> 00:03:38,448
I want to trust you again.

67
00:03:38,449 --> 00:03:39,650
I want to forgive you.

68
00:03:39,651 --> 00:03:40,852
I want... I want
all of those things.

69
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,821
I want us and I want us to work.

70
00:03:43,822 --> 00:03:45,490
I don't know why you feel
like I don't want that.

71
00:03:45,491 --> 00:03:48,507
Because we don't agree on
how we're going to get there.

72
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:02,911
Where are you?

73
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:07,115
To-do-to-do-to-do.

74
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:10,948
Okay.

75
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,784
<i>I have an idea.</i>

76
00:04:12,785 --> 00:04:13,819
<i>This is a great place.</i>

77
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:16,858
I think it will be very helpful.

78
00:04:19,822 --> 00:04:21,191
It's absolutely beautiful.

79
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:22,727
It's about an hour and a half
north from here.

80
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:25,530
It's like a...
like a perfect retreat,

81
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:26,931
just the two of you.

82
00:04:26,932 --> 00:04:30,368
Give you a chance
to reset the reset button.

83
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,903
I've sent
a lot of couples there,

84
00:04:31,904 --> 00:04:35,343
and they've all
come back renewed.

85
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,870
<i>- What do you think?
- I mean, I'll try anything.</i>

86
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:43,689
Sophie?

87
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,923
Wow!

88
00:06:06,932 --> 00:06:08,608
Hello?

89
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:50,568
And then when you pour
the wine, you do this.

90
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,008
This is what they do in the restaurants.

91
00:06:52,009 --> 00:06:53,443
Watch this.

92
00:06:53,444 --> 00:06:56,047
Ooops, so it doesn't drip.
Even though I kind of...

93
00:06:56,048 --> 00:06:57,448
- It kind of dripped.
- I don't think you did it right.

94
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:58,215
Cheers!

95
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,816
To me and my cooking.

96
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:02,186
There's a guest house on the
property which is pretty cool.

97
00:07:02,187 --> 00:07:03,588
- Really?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,691
I don't even know if we're supposed to
use it or if someone else is renting it.

99
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:08,626
Oh, God.
What's happening.

100
00:07:08,627 --> 00:07:10,160
Come here.
Come here.

101
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:11,865
What's happening?

102
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:14,767
Whoa!

103
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:17,902
Yeah, yeah.

104
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:18,904
You've got to hold it.

105
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:21,972
Hold it in, hold it in.

106
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,174
There you go.

107
00:07:23,175 --> 00:07:26,076
- Geez.
- Wow, still got it.

108
00:07:26,077 --> 00:07:27,677
Get the light going.

109
00:07:27,678 --> 00:07:30,047
- Sweetie.
- Sorry, sorry.

110
00:07:30,048 --> 00:07:31,985
Give me kiss.

111
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,087
Aw, you're so cute
without your glasses.

112
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,922
You shouldn't wear these.
I like you without them.

113
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,023
Do you like me
without the glasses?

114
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,793
Should I wear them?

115
00:08:51,495 --> 00:08:52,568
Get over here!

116
00:08:57,568 --> 00:08:58,903
You found me.

117
00:08:58,904 --> 00:09:00,539
I found you.

118
00:09:01,539 --> 00:09:02,572
Hey.

119
00:09:02,573 --> 00:09:03,407
Hey there.

120
00:09:03,408 --> 00:09:05,875
Hey, you know, you were right.

121
00:09:05,876 --> 00:09:07,876
Really?

122
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,180
Do tell.

123
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:13,084
We need to try more new things

124
00:09:13,085 --> 00:09:18,822
like weekends away
in places like this.

125
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,823
You think so?

126
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:25,896
It makes me excited
about us again.

127
00:09:25,897 --> 00:09:26,832
Do you feel it?

128
00:09:27,032 --> 00:09:29,323
- I do.
- Yeah.

129
00:09:52,323 --> 00:09:54,191
I love you.

130
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,192
I love you.

131
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,767
And here it comes.

132
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,134
- Aw.
- Oh.

133
00:10:04,135 --> 00:10:05,804
- Close!
- The bounce. It's okay.

134
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,805
- Okay, wait. Your turn.
- Okay.

135
00:10:07,806 --> 00:10:09,407
- Oh, under.
- Under. Okay.

136
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,408
Under and in.

137
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:11,809
Oh, shit!

138
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:13,878
Oh, you got it.
All right!

139
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,813
Of course I got it.

140
00:10:15,013 --> 00:10:16,013
Ready?

141
00:10:17,014 --> 00:10:18,581
This is your grape.

142
00:10:18,582 --> 00:10:19,852
Hi.

143
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:24,088
Come here, come here.

144
00:10:24,089 --> 00:10:25,089
What?

145
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,091
Come here.

146
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:29,427
That was awesome!

147
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,960
I knew you could do it.

148
00:10:30,961 --> 00:10:32,897
Do you want to
sleep here tonight?

149
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:33,998
Can we?

150
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:35,298
Sure. We can do
whatever we want.

151
00:10:35,299 --> 00:10:36,332
Okay. Yep.

152
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:37,500
Let me just get some clothes.

153
00:10:37,501 --> 00:10:38,536
I don't want to sleep
in my jeans.

154
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,071
- Okay.
- You want anything?

155
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,104
I'm good.

156
00:10:41,105 --> 00:10:42,672
I love you, hon.

157
00:10:42,673 --> 00:10:43,374
I'll be right here.

158
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:44,970
<i>'Kay.</i>

159
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,348
You're asleep.

160
00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:25,349
Very funny.

161
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:30,990
You did it.
You got your joke.

162
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:34,559
Ethan.

163
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:38,195
Ethan.

164
00:11:38,196 --> 00:11:40,298
Stop it.

165
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,532
I laughed.
It's over now.

166
00:11:42,533 --> 00:11:44,234
Where'd you go?
Where'd you go?

167
00:11:44,235 --> 00:11:46,036
How did you get up here so fast?

168
00:11:46,037 --> 00:11:50,240
Did you find
a secret passageway?

169
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:54,210
Yeah,
secret underground passage.

170
00:11:54,211 --> 00:11:56,211
Wow.

171
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,283
So mysterious.

172
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:03,186
No, seriously. How
did you get here so fast?

173
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:04,187
You beat me.

174
00:12:06,124 --> 00:12:07,590
What?

175
00:12:07,591 --> 00:12:12,196
How did you get here from
the guest house before me?

176
00:12:12,197 --> 00:12:13,998
You mean, before dinner?

177
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,367
I was just walking outside
and I just walked over.

178
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,170
No, not before dinner, just now.

179
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,772
Why are you so sweaty?

180
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:23,239
Did you go for a run
or something?

181
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,642
Oh, yeah.

182
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:28,546
Because... is that the joke
that's happening now?

183
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:29,580
What?

184
00:12:29,581 --> 00:12:31,080
The joke that you're
not going to remember

185
00:12:31,081 --> 00:12:34,084
that we just had sex,
because that's really funny.

186
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:35,085
Wait!

187
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,423
We just had sex?

188
00:12:39,423 --> 00:12:41,591
Okay. That's not funny.

189
00:12:41,592 --> 00:12:42,625
I'm not trying to be funny.

190
00:12:42,626 --> 00:12:44,260
I thought you were
making a joke.

191
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,595
Why are you doing
this right now?

192
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:46,763
I'm not doing anything.

193
00:12:46,764 --> 00:12:50,100
I-I've...

194
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,234
You know what, Ethan?

195
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:53,671
You just had a really nice night
and I don't know why you would ruin it.

196
00:12:53,672 --> 00:12:54,638
I'm not trying
to ruin our night.

197
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,672
I want to have a nice night.

198
00:12:55,673 --> 00:12:57,141
Fine, we had sex.
It was great.

199
00:12:57,142 --> 00:12:59,409
You were amazing.

200
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,478
You're an asshole.

201
00:13:01,479 --> 00:13:03,250
Good night.

202
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,608
I'm sorry.

203
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,243
I love you.

204
00:14:06,244 --> 00:14:07,381
I love you.

205
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,293
Hey.

206
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:23,393
Good morning, handsome.

207
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:26,197
Oh. I'm hungover.

208
00:14:27,465 --> 00:14:30,633
Well, it sounds like
you need some breakfast.

209
00:14:30,634 --> 00:14:33,103
Not that we need to
get back into it.

210
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:37,307
Um, but that was a little

211
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:38,742
bit of a weird fight last night.

212
00:14:38,743 --> 00:14:39,944
I know.

213
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:43,080
I don't really understand what happened,
but I feel like

214
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:45,215
maybe we just chalk it up
to like some bad pot...

215
00:14:45,216 --> 00:14:47,685
Alcohol combo, put it behind us

216
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:49,320
and not let it ruin the trip.

217
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:50,854
Agreed, totally.

218
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:52,428
<i>Cool.</i>

219
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:57,860
That being said,

220
00:14:57,861 --> 00:15:00,263
it was one of the weirder
fights we've had. Like...

221
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,264
Oh my God, I know.

222
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:02,465
Crazy, right?

223
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:04,368
I mean I-I still don't
fully understand

224
00:15:04,369 --> 00:15:06,903
whether you were
so drunk and stoned

225
00:15:06,904 --> 00:15:08,638
that you thought we had sex

226
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,307
or were you just were making
a joke and it backfired.

227
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:14,979
Honestly, I think it was just
one of those things, you know?

228
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,314
One of those things...
no, I'm asking you

229
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:21,417
was it that you were drunk and stoned
or was it playing a joke...

230
00:15:21,418 --> 00:15:22,853
because I'm still confused
what happened.

231
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:26,724
I think the important thing is that,
you know, we fought, we made up,

232
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,028
we had a nice cuddle,
beautiful day.

233
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:31,461
Sophie, what are you
talking about?

234
00:15:31,462 --> 00:15:33,297
We had a fight
and you stormed out.

235
00:15:33,298 --> 00:15:35,165
We didn't make up.

236
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:36,499
Are you okay?

237
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,735
I'm fine, are you okay? I'm...

238
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:41,372
Okay, Mr. Hangover.

239
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,172
I think it's time for some food.

240
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:45,242
Let's get something
in your stomach.

241
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,411
You're kind of freaking me out
a little bit, Sophie.

242
00:15:47,412 --> 00:15:51,215
I've got to say...
Is that bacon?

243
00:15:51,216 --> 00:15:53,249
Yeah.

244
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,197
You hate it when I eat bacon.

245
00:16:43,534 --> 00:16:44,534
What?

246
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,175
What's going on?

247
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,076
That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

248
00:16:53,077 --> 00:16:55,451
I don't understand
why you're doing this.

249
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,417
No.

250
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:01,418
No, no, no, no.

251
00:17:02,019 --> 00:17:03,119
No what?

252
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,555
This was...
There were plates... Hello?

253
00:17:04,556 --> 00:17:05,756
What are you
talking about plates?

254
00:17:05,757 --> 00:17:06,890
- Hello, hello?
- What are you... Ethan?

255
00:17:06,891 --> 00:17:08,558
- Where'd you go?
- Where'd who go?

256
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,960
Ethan?

257
00:17:10,961 --> 00:17:11,961
Hello?

258
00:17:11,962 --> 00:17:13,130
Ethan?

259
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:14,765
There was bacon right there
on those plates...

260
00:17:14,766 --> 00:17:16,633
What are you talking about?
Ethan, answer me.

261
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:18,035
You can't...
the smell of bacon...

262
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,037
you can't get the smell of bacon
out in five minutes.

263
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:21,438
- There was bacon...
- What about bacon?

264
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:22,739
Right here.
There was bacon here.

265
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,875
Why are you acting like this?

266
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:28,612
Shit. Sophie, Sophie.

267
00:17:28,613 --> 00:17:29,746
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

268
00:17:29,747 --> 00:17:30,713
Sophie, Sophie...

269
00:17:30,714 --> 00:17:31,748
- What?
- I'm sorry.

270
00:17:31,749 --> 00:17:33,083
- What?
- I'm sorry, just wait.

271
00:17:33,084 --> 00:17:36,720
I'm sorry. I'm spazing out in there,
I know, but something fucking weird

272
00:17:36,721 --> 00:17:39,123
like Twilight Zone shit
is going on here,

273
00:17:39,124 --> 00:17:41,658
and I'm trying to get
a handle on it, okay?

274
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:43,660
Last night we had a nice dinner.

275
00:17:43,661 --> 00:17:44,901
We had a blast together, right?

276
00:17:45,028 --> 00:17:46,296
- Yes.
- Okay.

277
00:17:46,297 --> 00:17:47,730
Then, we smoked some pot.

278
00:17:47,731 --> 00:17:49,399
I fell asleep on the couch.

279
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,168
Next thing I know,
you woke me up

280
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,437
claiming that we had
just had sex together.

281
00:17:53,438 --> 00:17:55,338
Because we did!

282
00:17:55,339 --> 00:17:56,508
Okay. I came here.

283
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,747
Nobody was here.

284
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,543
I fell asleep on this couch

285
00:17:59,544 --> 00:18:01,644
and I woke up
to you snuggling me.

286
00:18:01,645 --> 00:18:02,746
What? What are you
talking about?

287
00:18:02,747 --> 00:18:04,147
No, I didn't.

288
00:18:04,148 --> 00:18:05,481
That's crazy to me
that you would deny that, okay?

289
00:18:05,482 --> 00:18:07,217
- I didn't.
- Exactly.

290
00:18:07,218 --> 00:18:09,553
Crazy just like me denying
that I had slept with you.

291
00:18:09,554 --> 00:18:11,421
You know what I'm saying?

292
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:14,790
We had two completely separate
experiences with each other

293
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:18,428
that neither of us remembers,
and...

294
00:18:18,429 --> 00:18:21,331
Hang on a second. I'm going to
go in there by myself, okay?

295
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:22,732
Why?

296
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:23,801
You just stay here for like
30 seconds. Don't move.

297
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,844
Ethan!

298
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,535
Hello?

299
00:18:57,535 --> 00:18:58,770
Hey, Babe.

300
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:01,810
Can you hand me a towel?

301
00:19:06,652 --> 00:19:07,810
You're in that shower.

302
00:19:07,811 --> 00:19:09,880
I just handed you a towel.

303
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:12,382
Okay, you know what,
I'm not even mad anymore.

304
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:15,552
Now you're just scaring me, and I don't
understand why you're doing this.

305
00:19:15,553 --> 00:19:17,761
Go, go see for yourself, Sophie.

306
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:26,654
Be careful.

307
00:19:49,654 --> 00:19:51,590
Hey, where you been all morning?

308
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,627
Hello, Sophie.

309
00:19:56,627 --> 00:19:58,562
I was just walking.

310
00:19:58,563 --> 00:19:59,595
Oh, yeah.

311
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:01,230
That's really nice out?

312
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:02,633
It's actually
a little bright in here.

313
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:04,469
Do you mind if I close these?

314
00:20:07,939 --> 00:20:09,640
The morning sun here is insane.

315
00:20:09,641 --> 00:20:10,809
Give me a hug.

316
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,846
Sorry.
I'm a little sweaty.

317
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:17,584
That's okay.

318
00:20:59,790 --> 00:21:01,127
Come on.

319
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,798
Sophie.

320
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:09,741
Soph?

321
00:21:17,741 --> 00:21:19,550
Fuck this.

322
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:27,550
You're kidding me!

323
00:21:33,223 --> 00:21:34,790
Sophie?

324
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,893
Oh my God!
Hey, are you okay?

325
00:21:37,894 --> 00:21:39,863
You're in there.
It's you.

326
00:21:39,864 --> 00:21:41,731
You're exercising.

327
00:21:41,732 --> 00:21:43,333
What is happening?

328
00:21:43,334 --> 00:21:44,692
I don't know.

329
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:10,893
This is so... crazy.

330
00:22:10,894 --> 00:22:12,629
Did that really happen?

331
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:13,997
I mean, did that, was that...

332
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,632
I just don't...
I don't understand.

333
00:22:15,633 --> 00:22:18,067
Is it another dimension,

334
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:19,870
like when you go
through the door,

335
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:23,339
is it another plane
of existence or...

336
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,540
I don't know.

337
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,674
I've no clue.

338
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:29,613
I think we need to just say
some weird shit happened.

339
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:30,947
We compartmentalize it.

340
00:22:30,948 --> 00:22:32,382
There was a cosmic
aberration of some sort...

341
00:22:32,383 --> 00:22:35,684
- Yeah, yeah. Move on.
- And we go home.

342
00:22:35,685 --> 00:22:38,354
We don't talk about this again,
and we just stop thinking about it.

343
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:39,722
Okay.

344
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:42,898
- Yeah. We could move on.
- Done.

345
00:22:47,898 --> 00:22:50,868
Oh my God, I can't
stop thinking about it.

346
00:22:51,868 --> 00:22:53,606
Can you?

347
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:58,642
We're just going to
have to just I guess...

348
00:22:58,643 --> 00:22:59,910
Time, you know.

349
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,679
I'm not going to be able to
stop thinking about this, Ethan.

350
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,213
Well, what else can we do?

351
00:23:04,214 --> 00:23:06,984
I mean what are we, what ar
we going to do, you know?

352
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:09,587
Well, I mean, there's the...

353
00:23:10,587 --> 00:23:12,721
there's the crazy thing
to do which is...

354
00:23:12,722 --> 00:23:14,156
What?

355
00:23:14,157 --> 00:23:17,030
Which is to, you know,
explore it further.

356
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,431
Explore it further?

357
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,066
I know you only had
a little bit of it...

358
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:24,468
Yeah. I was there for
like three seconds.

359
00:23:24,469 --> 00:23:27,770
I know. And I,
but I had a whole evening...

360
00:23:27,771 --> 00:23:30,172
In that house, and I have to say,

361
00:23:30,173 --> 00:23:33,509
I know I sound like
a crazy person right now,

362
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:36,013
but I have to say
it was kind of magical.

363
00:23:37,013 --> 00:23:38,547
- Well...
- It was...

364
00:23:38,548 --> 00:23:42,318
But don't go overboard with the whole magic
of what happened there

365
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,620
because I know what you
did in there, okay?

366
00:23:43,621 --> 00:23:45,055
All right. That's not
what I'm talking about.

367
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:46,922
I'm not talking about
that kind of magic.

368
00:23:46,923 --> 00:23:47,990
There was a rush.

369
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:52,962
It was exciting.
I felt happy.

370
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:54,230
And it wasn't just that.

371
00:23:54,231 --> 00:23:55,531
It wasn't just the time
in the guest house.

372
00:23:55,532 --> 00:23:58,034
I mean, we had a great time
in the main house.

373
00:23:58,035 --> 00:23:59,970
Yes, we did.
We had a good time.

374
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:01,203
It wasn't just the weed.

375
00:24:01,204 --> 00:24:03,139
I mean we were connecting,
we were talking,

376
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,741
we were happy,
we were... happy.

377
00:24:05,742 --> 00:24:06,742
Yes.

378
00:24:06,743 --> 00:24:07,863
We also had a fantastic time

379
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:09,546
when we did ecstasy
at Lalapalooza,

380
00:24:09,547 --> 00:24:12,982
but we're not going to do that every
day of our lives because you die...

381
00:24:12,983 --> 00:24:14,250
- Right.
- Okay?

382
00:24:14,251 --> 00:24:15,618
There's a question
of our safety here.

383
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:18,188
Yeah. But I didn't feel
like it was dangerous.

384
00:24:18,189 --> 00:24:20,226
I didn't feel...
I felt safe.

385
00:24:22,226 --> 00:24:23,993
I didn't feel dangerous, either.

386
00:24:23,994 --> 00:24:25,528
I felt like I was with you.

387
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:28,131
This is something that we've
been talking about in therapy...

388
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:31,867
exploring new options,
creating a new relationship...

389
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:33,870
Not going back to the past

390
00:24:33,871 --> 00:24:36,038
and re-creating
old things that happened

391
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,806
but starting with new things.

392
00:24:37,807 --> 00:24:39,709
Yeah. Point taken.

393
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:40,844
I know that this is...

394
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:41,810
I didn't imagine this sort of...

395
00:24:41,811 --> 00:24:42,778
- Extreme.
- New thing.

396
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:43,947
Absolutely, but...

397
00:24:43,948 --> 00:24:46,082
I imagined like horseback riding

398
00:24:46,083 --> 00:24:49,118
with a little satchel of wine,
you know?

399
00:24:49,119 --> 00:24:50,653
Not exploring other dimensions

400
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:53,522
in some weird version of
Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?

401
00:24:53,523 --> 00:24:56,529
What if this is something
that I want to do?

402
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:00,063
You want to go back?

403
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:02,776
I want to help our relationship.

404
00:25:11,776 --> 00:25:15,144
So... a little weird
to say this,

405
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:18,147
but I'm struggling
a little bit with the fact

406
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:23,853
that you slept with
the other me last night.

407
00:25:23,854 --> 00:25:25,287
Yeah, but I thought it was you.

408
00:25:25,288 --> 00:25:26,989
I know. I'm not mad
or blaming you.

409
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:30,192
I just like...
I'd be lying if I, you know,

410
00:25:30,193 --> 00:25:32,194
so I was a little jealous,
I guess.

411
00:25:32,195 --> 00:25:33,697
All right.
I understand,

412
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,537
but obviously I would never
knowingly cheat on you.

413
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,838
So it seems like it only works
if we go in one at a time.

414
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,074
Correct.

415
00:25:44,075 --> 00:25:47,391
So I guess we'll just figure out
who wants to go in there first.

416
00:26:12,202 --> 00:26:14,873
I'll be out in a minute,
sweetheart.

417
00:26:15,873 --> 00:26:17,843
Okay, I'm here.

418
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:20,910
Whoa, that's good.

419
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,045
Um.

420
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:23,246
Hey, is that bacon okay?

421
00:26:23,247 --> 00:26:25,582
It's been sitting out
for awhile.

422
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,583
It's good.

423
00:26:30,453 --> 00:26:32,287
Good.

424
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:34,257
Where have you been all morning?

425
00:26:34,258 --> 00:26:36,896
Hanging out, you know.

426
00:26:39,896 --> 00:26:41,099
Cool.

427
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:44,136
I missed you.

428
00:26:46,136 --> 00:26:47,937
You missed me?

429
00:26:47,938 --> 00:26:49,807
Of course.

430
00:26:50,807 --> 00:26:52,076
Come sit with me.

431
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,449
Okay.

432
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:01,951
So...

433
00:27:01,952 --> 00:27:03,420
So...

434
00:27:03,421 --> 00:27:06,088
Isn't it crazy to think
that we're actually married?

435
00:27:06,089 --> 00:27:09,959
I guess so.

436
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,361
We are husband and wife.

437
00:27:11,362 --> 00:27:12,929
<i>- I know.
- Yeah.</i>

438
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,097
I love it.

439
00:27:15,098 --> 00:27:16,665
How long have you been
here, by the way?

440
00:27:16,666 --> 00:27:19,368
Since we came yesterday, silly.

441
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:21,171
No, I mean, in the guest house.

442
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:23,074
Since we slept here last night.

443
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,175
Oh. Someone's
in detective mode.

444
00:27:26,176 --> 00:27:27,309
Sorry. I didn't mean to be.

445
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,813
That's okay.
I don't mind.

446
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,248
Have you explored
the grounds very much?

447
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,355
I think I have
a pretty good sense of it.

448
00:27:34,939 --> 00:27:36,518
It's so pretty here, isn't it?

449
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:39,189
It is. Would you like to go on
a walk with me?

450
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:42,092
Not really right now,
but you're welcome to go on a walk.

451
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:43,357
It's your vacation, too.

452
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,064
Okay.

453
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:50,033
I'll see you
in a little bit, Sophie.

454
00:27:50,034 --> 00:27:52,338
Okay, Ethan.

455
00:27:59,175 --> 00:28:01,143
Whoa.

456
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:02,746
- Fascinating.
- Tell me.

457
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:07,283
Okay. That being in there is
100% convinced that she is you.

458
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:08,451
- She is?
- Yeah.

459
00:28:08,452 --> 00:28:09,419
I threw out
some soft challenges.

460
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:11,621
She is unflappable.

461
00:28:11,622 --> 00:28:13,088
I think when you go in there...

462
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:14,089
God, it's crazy.

463
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,258
Yeah, you throw out some
like very specific examples

464
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,094
from our past
and see how he reacts.

465
00:28:18,095 --> 00:28:19,129
Oh, no, no, sweetie.

466
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,331
I don't think we're
supposed to challenge them.

467
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,967
What if they disappear
or something, you know?

468
00:28:23,968 --> 00:28:25,015
What if they freak out?

469
00:28:25,215 --> 00:28:28,403
I'm just saying what's the harm in
letting them think that they're us?

470
00:28:28,404 --> 00:28:31,306
Yeah, I mean, I...
all right.

471
00:28:31,307 --> 00:28:32,508
There's no harm in it.

472
00:28:32,509 --> 00:28:34,277
I just thought
part of the fun of this

473
00:28:34,278 --> 00:28:36,979
was like the investigation
and trying to...

474
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:39,716
I know. Of course you thought
the fun was in the investigation.

475
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:40,650
Wait, hold on.

476
00:28:40,651 --> 00:28:42,251
It's like at
the magic show in Vegas

477
00:28:42,252 --> 00:28:44,820
when you told me how the magician
did every single trick

478
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:47,957
and you ruined the entire show
for me and everyone around us.

479
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,793
Okay. You remember we talked
about the magic show

480
00:28:49,794 --> 00:28:52,929
was three years ago
and we're moving past that?

481
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:54,396
- Okay.
- Yeah.

482
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:55,765
Let's go inside.

483
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,267
We'll make up
some ground rules together.

484
00:28:57,268 --> 00:29:00,068
That way neither of us feels like,
you know, there's any kind of...

485
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:01,371
Confusion.

486
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:03,472
- Or just being on the same page.
- Okay.

487
00:29:03,473 --> 00:29:05,240
While we are in the guest house

488
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:09,045
with the weird people,
no intimacy, no sex.

489
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,913
Yes. Absolutely agreed.

490
00:29:10,914 --> 00:29:12,181
- No sex.
- Good.

491
00:29:12,182 --> 00:29:13,415
What else?

492
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:16,286
Well, I would say that would lead me to,
you know, no spying

493
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:18,988
and there has to be trust involved,
and we'll be honest with each other

494
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,957
about what happens
in the guest house and...

495
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:22,225
Right. It's like a...

496
00:29:22,226 --> 00:29:23,526
it's like a therapy exercise
in trust almost.

497
00:29:23,527 --> 00:29:25,127
- It's a trust exercise.
- Okay, great.

498
00:29:25,128 --> 00:29:26,162
That's why we're here.

499
00:29:26,163 --> 00:29:28,698
Good. Um.

500
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:29,833
Let's see.

501
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,268
I guess if there's
anything else...

502
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:35,438
Actually this is kind of really
important now that I think about it.

503
00:29:35,439 --> 00:29:37,472
We can have fun with this,
but if at any point either of us

504
00:29:37,473 --> 00:29:40,442
becomes uncomfortable
and wants to stop,

505
00:29:40,443 --> 00:29:43,512
we just cut it off,
pack our bags...

506
00:29:43,513 --> 00:29:44,681
Absolutely, absolutely.

507
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:45,781
Agreed.

508
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:47,083
That's a good one,
that's a really good one.

509
00:29:47,084 --> 00:29:49,318
Yeah.

510
00:29:49,319 --> 00:29:51,487
Anything else?

511
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,755
I think that's it.

512
00:29:52,756 --> 00:29:54,123
I do too.

513
00:29:54,124 --> 00:29:56,459
So since we're just kind of
like dipping our toes in here,

514
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,162
I think maybe we shouldn't spend too
much time in there the first go-around.

515
00:30:00,163 --> 00:30:02,364
Okay. How does
15 minutes sound?

516
00:30:02,365 --> 00:30:04,534
Yeah, I think that's good.

517
00:30:04,535 --> 00:30:07,430
Okay, but don't, you know,
stand outside waiting for me.

518
00:30:08,372 --> 00:30:09,806
Wait, what?

519
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,374
Well, you know, I think
it's going to make me nervous

520
00:30:11,375 --> 00:30:13,902
if I think you're waiting
right outside the door.

521
00:30:14,545 --> 00:30:16,185
Yeah, okay.
That's fair.

522
00:30:22,058 --> 00:30:23,585
Oh, you mean, like right now?

523
00:30:23,586 --> 00:30:24,820
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

524
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:25,587
Yes, sorry.

525
00:30:25,588 --> 00:30:27,089
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

526
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,624
Okay.

527
00:30:28,625 --> 00:30:31,663
Enjoy yourself, but be safe.

528
00:31:06,663 --> 00:31:07,663
Hey.

529
00:31:13,136 --> 00:31:16,506
It's nice.

530
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:17,606
You could be honest.

531
00:31:17,607 --> 00:31:19,275
I handle the criticism.

532
00:31:19,276 --> 00:31:20,279
No, it's...

533
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:24,814
okay.

534
00:31:24,815 --> 00:31:29,586
I think I look a little severe.

535
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:33,422
Is that how you see me?

536
00:31:33,423 --> 00:31:34,557
No.

537
00:31:36,508 --> 00:31:38,193
I'm just not
a very good painter.

538
00:31:38,194 --> 00:31:39,240
No.

539
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,375
I was trying to emulate Degas

540
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:57,913
who lights up his portrait faces
with all these wonderful colors.

541
00:31:57,914 --> 00:31:59,248
Degas?

542
00:31:59,249 --> 00:32:02,419
Unfortunately, it looks like
your face was lit on fire...

543
00:32:03,065 --> 00:32:04,487
Which was not my intention.

544
00:32:04,488 --> 00:32:05,922
I apologize.

545
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:08,029
But it yielded
a wonderful title, though.

546
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:13,195
I'm thinking of calling it
"Sophie My Love, the Burn Victim."

547
00:32:13,196 --> 00:32:17,366
Or the alternate title
"Sophie My Love, the Full-On Bitch"

548
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:18,668
because I look awfully bitchy.

549
00:32:18,669 --> 00:32:20,103
- Well...
- Sorry.

550
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,939
Well, in all fairness,
sometimes you're a bitch.

551
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,339
Excuse me?

552
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:27,477
Yeah, but it's cool
because I'm an asshole sometimes, you know?

553
00:32:27,478 --> 00:32:28,577
Right.

554
00:32:28,578 --> 00:32:30,313
We can say that, right?

555
00:32:30,314 --> 00:32:33,415
No, I think it's good.

556
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:34,688
- Scoot over.
- Thanks.

557
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:39,889
Okay.

558
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:41,124
Cheers.

559
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:44,398
- Cheers.
- To a perfect weekend together.

560
00:32:50,299 --> 00:32:51,299
That's very nice.

561
00:33:00,676 --> 00:33:01,978
Where you going?

562
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:05,647
Nowhere but here.

563
00:33:05,648 --> 00:33:07,383
Why are you nervous?

564
00:33:07,384 --> 00:33:08,718
I'm not nervous.

565
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:11,287
Why do you think I'm nervous?

566
00:33:11,288 --> 00:33:13,523
Give me your hand.

567
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:17,429
What?
Don't you trust me?

568
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,848
You were spying on me.

569
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,549
Well, yeah. You were
like over 20 minutes in there.

570
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:14,884
Over 20...

571
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:17,587
we didn't agree it would be exactly
15 minutes, five minutes over?

572
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,689
Yeah, but you know, we didn't agree
on like intimate massages either.

573
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,558
Wait, wait. Intimate,
intimate massages?

574
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:23,859
Are you serious?

575
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,093
You were into it.

576
00:34:25,094 --> 00:34:26,828
I was not into...

577
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,397
I was rocking your body
in there.

578
00:34:28,398 --> 00:34:29,531
All right. All right.

579
00:34:29,532 --> 00:34:32,334
I'm sorry. I can see
how that might have made you uncomfortable,

580
00:34:32,335 --> 00:34:34,669
and I apologize.

581
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,738
- Okay?
- It's a little confusing. Sorry.

582
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:36,738
All right.
It won't happen again.

583
00:34:36,739 --> 00:34:37,839
- Okay.
- Understood.

584
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,375
How was it in general though?

585
00:34:39,376 --> 00:34:40,676
Oh my God, it's so weird.

586
00:34:40,677 --> 00:34:42,879
- It's so strange.
- It's really odd.

587
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,714
I mean, you were just...
you were wonderful.

588
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:48,783
You were funny and charming, and you just
kept telling me all these great things

589
00:34:48,784 --> 00:34:51,654
we should do
on the property and...

590
00:34:51,655 --> 00:34:53,455
Does he feel like me to you?

591
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:56,829
He is you...
he's just a little...

592
00:34:58,829 --> 00:35:00,431
A little what?

593
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:07,136
It's... how to describe it...
You know,

594
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:11,174
it's like you're funny,
you know.

595
00:35:11,175 --> 00:35:14,142
You have a great sense of humor
and everyone likes you and...

596
00:35:14,143 --> 00:35:15,111
Thanks.

597
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,779
And that's who you are...
in there,

598
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,781
but it's like a memory of it.

599
00:35:18,782 --> 00:35:21,216
It's like I'm being
reminded of it or something,

600
00:35:21,217 --> 00:35:23,752
but it's happening
right in front of me.

601
00:35:23,753 --> 00:35:26,657
Does that make any sense?

602
00:35:27,657 --> 00:35:31,295
You're not saying
that like it's like...

603
00:35:31,495 --> 00:35:33,828
the better version
when you're in there, right?

604
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:35,397
No, no, no, no, no.

605
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:36,598
You're just...

606
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,700
Not at all.
That's the crazy thing.

607
00:35:37,701 --> 00:35:39,935
It is you in there, you know?

608
00:35:39,936 --> 00:35:42,904
What about the physicality...
do you notice any differences?

609
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:45,942
No. No, not really.

610
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:47,514
Yeah.

611
00:35:50,514 --> 00:35:52,515
You know what, the hair.

612
00:35:52,516 --> 00:35:54,783
There's something
about the hair.

613
00:35:54,784 --> 00:35:55,784
The hair?

614
00:35:55,851 --> 00:35:57,220
It's a little different.

615
00:35:57,221 --> 00:36:02,159
It's like it's a little messier,
it's kind of beachy.

616
00:36:03,159 --> 00:36:04,926
- Did you say beachy?
- Yeah.

617
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:06,361
Come here. Let me see.

618
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:08,497
It's like, like kind of...

619
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:11,267
well, well, it's like really...

620
00:36:11,268 --> 00:36:13,847
I don't know. I'm not doing it
right or something.

621
00:36:15,505 --> 00:36:16,705
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

622
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:18,040
Don't worry about it.

623
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,174
Cool.

624
00:36:19,175 --> 00:36:22,679
Oh, and you know what,
you don't wear glasses.

625
00:36:23,294 --> 00:36:26,716
You don't wear glasses in there and
you seem totally fine with it.

626
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:28,619
Well.

627
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:33,888
In the guest house, I'm a surfer
with perfect vision.

628
00:36:33,889 --> 00:36:35,091
We'll work on this.

629
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:37,660
It's not quite...
No, it's good.

630
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:39,396
We're getting there.

631
00:36:44,467 --> 00:36:47,483
You've tried contacts, right?

632
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:03,253
Hey, Soph?

633
00:37:04,142 --> 00:37:06,721
I'd like to take my session
at the guest house now

634
00:37:06,722 --> 00:37:08,491
if that's cool.

635
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,959
Um, what time is it?

636
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,895
It's late,
but I just can't sleep.

637
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:15,802
Oh, okay, sweetie.

638
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:22,504
Okay.
I love you.

639
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:23,800
I love you.

640
00:37:49,377 --> 00:37:50,799
What are you talking about?

641
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:54,069
There are like six
versions of the same doll.

642
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,738
They're completely
unique in every way.

643
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:58,908
There are six
different ladies here.

644
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:02,210
- I don't see it.
- Okay.

645
00:38:02,211 --> 00:38:06,816
Okay, this one is
the beautiful model girl

646
00:38:06,817 --> 00:38:11,053
who is always talking about
how she was such a nerd in high school,

647
00:38:11,054 --> 00:38:13,423
and then oh, this one...
it definitely has two

648
00:38:14,023 --> 00:38:17,660
tramp stamps underneath
that dress, for sure.

649
00:38:17,661 --> 00:38:20,395
And then you've got...

650
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:23,832
this one is the coolest girl
in the world,

651
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,767
and she'd make
the most wonderful wife,

652
00:38:25,768 --> 00:38:29,872
but no one's going to be able
to look past her chubby thighs.

653
00:38:29,873 --> 00:38:30,939
Which one of these
is your favorite?

654
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,308
Which one do you like the most?

655
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,341
Okay.

656
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:35,342
Ready for this?

657
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,918
Ooh, I dropped it.

658
00:38:41,307 --> 00:38:43,886
How is that not the cutest
thing you've ever seen?

659
00:38:43,887 --> 00:38:45,788
<i>- It really is cute.
- It's so tiny.</i>

660
00:38:45,789 --> 00:38:47,730
<i>It's adorable.</i>

661
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,600
<i>Hey.</i>

662
00:39:31,601 --> 00:39:32,771
Hi.

663
00:39:34,771 --> 00:39:35,837
What you doing?

664
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:37,272
Nothing.
What are you doing?

665
00:39:37,273 --> 00:39:38,945
No-o-thing.

666
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,946
Have you...

667
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,583
Have I what?

668
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:48,783
Nothing.

669
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:50,718
Never mind.

670
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,955
So, what's on
the agenda for today?

671
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,957
I was going to maybe
go explore some more

672
00:39:54,958 --> 00:39:58,393
and you know, just...
If that's okay.

673
00:39:58,394 --> 00:40:00,428
- Of course.
- What about you?

674
00:40:00,429 --> 00:40:01,497
I don't know.

675
00:40:01,498 --> 00:40:04,966
I thought I'd maybe
just hang out here, read.

676
00:40:04,967 --> 00:40:06,807
Sounds nice. Maybe I'll
come by in a little bit

677
00:40:07,003 --> 00:40:07,803
and we can spend some time.

678
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,705
Whatever you want.

679
00:40:09,706 --> 00:40:11,841
Okay.

680
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,646
Oh, I found your phone.

681
00:40:16,646 --> 00:40:18,646
Thanks.

682
00:40:47,744 --> 00:40:49,793
Come on.

683
00:41:03,793 --> 00:41:05,128
Hello.

684
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:08,039
I'm up here.

685
00:41:17,039 --> 00:41:18,197
Watch your head, okay?

686
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:24,078
Very cute up here.

687
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,148
It's a little small.

688
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:30,051
What are you doing up here?

689
00:41:30,052 --> 00:41:31,338
I'm feeling very big.

690
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:33,023
I feel enormous.

691
00:41:35,157 --> 00:41:36,658
Um. I'm glad you're here

692
00:41:36,659 --> 00:41:39,194
because there is something
I want to talk to you about.

693
00:41:39,195 --> 00:41:40,328
And it's a bit of
an elephant in the room,

694
00:41:40,329 --> 00:41:45,801
and I think it's time
we discuss it.

695
00:41:45,802 --> 00:41:47,713
- All right.
- Okay.

696
00:41:57,713 --> 00:41:59,214
- This.
- Oh, that...

697
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:00,482
Is happening.

698
00:42:00,483 --> 00:42:01,283
Oh.

699
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:02,785
- Well.
- Ladies first.

700
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:04,021
In that case.

701
00:42:04,254 --> 00:42:06,254
- Who the fuck starts with
- O? I know.

702
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:07,756
Who the hell
do you think you are?

703
00:42:07,757 --> 00:42:08,790
Crazy.

704
00:42:08,791 --> 00:42:10,192
Goddamn anarchist.

705
00:42:10,193 --> 00:42:12,797
All right. I'll just
do an X in the middle.

706
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:15,964
That's a great move.

707
00:42:15,965 --> 00:42:18,534
Boom.

708
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:21,069
I think I see
where this is headed.

709
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,073
I'm not quite sure yet.

710
00:42:24,074 --> 00:42:25,941
Yeah, I'm going to
block you there.

711
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:27,109
Where do you think I should go?

712
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:28,176
How's it going to end?

713
00:42:28,177 --> 00:42:29,143
What do you think I should do?

714
00:42:29,144 --> 00:42:30,212
Who's going to win?

715
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:31,980
Oh, the suspense!

716
00:42:31,981 --> 00:42:33,781
Oh, yes, and there it is.

717
00:42:33,782 --> 00:42:35,084
What's your next game?

718
00:42:35,085 --> 00:42:37,553
My next game is something
that is appropriate

719
00:42:37,554 --> 00:42:39,988
for people over the age of six.

720
00:42:39,989 --> 00:42:40,989
I think that's a thing.

721
00:42:40,990 --> 00:42:44,560
Why don't you kiss me anymore?

722
00:42:44,561 --> 00:42:46,895
Um, I've enjoyed
just hanging out

723
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:49,864
and reconnecting and...

724
00:42:49,865 --> 00:42:51,100
I have too.

725
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:55,904
I know, but I love kissing you
and I miss it.

726
00:42:55,905 --> 00:42:58,374
Is there something I'm doing
that's bothering you or...

727
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,609
Oh my God, no, not at all.

728
00:43:00,610 --> 00:43:02,821
Does it feel like
we're having a good time?

729
00:43:05,178 --> 00:43:06,547
We're having a great time.

730
00:43:06,548 --> 00:43:07,548
Yeah.

731
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:11,819
- Give me this.
- You're taking my chalk.

732
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,288
That's my...
that's my chalk.

733
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:15,025
I know it's your talk.

734
00:43:16,025 --> 00:43:17,067
Hey.

735
00:43:24,067 --> 00:43:28,604
<i>All right. This is weird,
but I think some of my shirts are missing.</i>

736
00:43:28,605 --> 00:43:29,538
Really?

737
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:30,772
<i>Yeah.</i>

738
00:43:30,773 --> 00:43:33,841
Are you sure they're not
just hanging in the closet

739
00:43:33,842 --> 00:43:35,743
and you didn't pack them
like you usually do?

740
00:43:35,744 --> 00:43:39,348
No, no. Stuff that I packed
is not here.

741
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:42,052
<i>- Well, that's weird.
- Yeah. That's weird.</i>

742
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,127
What's so funny?

743
00:43:52,128 --> 00:43:53,995
<i>Oh, nothing, I guess.</i>

744
00:43:53,996 --> 00:43:55,032
Just a funny text.

745
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:57,869
Oh yeah?
Who's texting you?

746
00:43:59,869 --> 00:44:01,472
Um...

747
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:06,107
Wait, he's texting you?

748
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:07,142
Babe, it's nothing.

749
00:44:07,143 --> 00:44:08,710
It's just a text, okay?

750
00:44:08,711 --> 00:44:11,014
I'm not upset.
I just think it's weird.

751
00:44:12,014 --> 00:44:14,288
They have cellphones?

752
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:20,601
What plan do they even have?

753
00:44:53,956 --> 00:44:55,424
Thanks.

754
00:44:55,425 --> 00:44:58,000
So nice outside today.

755
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,533
Um.

756
00:45:05,534 --> 00:45:08,370
Can I ask you a question?

757
00:45:08,371 --> 00:45:09,371
Of course.

758
00:45:13,242 --> 00:45:15,148
Why did you do it?

759
00:45:19,148 --> 00:45:21,353
Why did you cheat on me?

760
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:25,190
I'm sorry.
That's probably...

761
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,290
- That's okay.
- Not something you want to...

762
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,691
No, that's okay.

763
00:45:29,692 --> 00:45:35,397
I have been thinking
about that a bit this weekend,

764
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:40,371
and I have no excuse.

765
00:45:42,371 --> 00:45:43,805
Of course I was insecure

766
00:45:43,806 --> 00:45:48,310
and of course we were
drifting apart at the time

767
00:45:48,311 --> 00:45:50,779
and instead of trying
to communicate

768
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,716
I lashed out and I made
a terrible decision,

769
00:45:54,717 --> 00:45:59,620
and that's...

770
00:45:59,621 --> 00:46:01,122
Right.

771
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:03,424
No, let me finish.

772
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:07,495
That's no excuse.

773
00:46:07,496 --> 00:46:13,538
You had every right
to abandon me,

774
00:46:15,538 --> 00:46:21,442
but you didn't,
and you stuck in there with me

775
00:46:21,443 --> 00:46:25,379
and you went to see that stupid
therapist that we see,

776
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,317
even though we didn't want to,
and you kept going,

777
00:46:29,318 --> 00:46:32,321
and you kept trying,
and you met me halfway

778
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:38,794
and I was defensive
and I'm sorry about that.

779
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:44,899
And I want to say thank you
for making those efforts for us,

780
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:49,238
and I promise you
I'm going to do my best

781
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:53,207
to meet you there, okay?

782
00:46:53,208 --> 00:46:54,242
I promise.

783
00:47:26,242 --> 00:47:27,709
Hello.

784
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:29,243
Hey.

785
00:47:29,244 --> 00:47:31,192
I didn't hear you
get up this morning.

786
00:47:32,547 --> 00:47:35,320
I just came down to see
if there was anything on TV.

787
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,187
What, do you think
I'm lying to you?

788
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:40,589
No.

789
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:43,063
No, I was...
just seemed to...

790
00:47:48,063 --> 00:47:51,098
Is there anything
you want to talk about?

791
00:47:51,099 --> 00:47:52,267
No.

792
00:47:52,268 --> 00:47:55,270
There anything
you want to talk about?

793
00:47:55,271 --> 00:47:57,171
Look this weekend
is super weird...

794
00:47:57,172 --> 00:47:58,806
- that's okay, right?
- Yeah.

795
00:47:58,807 --> 00:48:03,578
I mean, you know,
I think it can be confusing,

796
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:06,415
but I just...

797
00:48:06,416 --> 00:48:07,816
you know it's not real, right?

798
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:13,489
I mean, I'm not that guy
out there doing sit-ups...

799
00:48:14,489 --> 00:48:21,163
And I could never
be really interested

800
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:22,897
in some other version of you,

801
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:26,600
knowing that my real Sophie
is here...

802
00:48:26,601 --> 00:48:29,404
- Right.
- And I just...

803
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:31,339
I want to make sure
you still agree.

804
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,542
Yeah.

805
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:35,243
Of course.

806
00:48:35,244 --> 00:48:36,246
Okay.

807
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,415
Okay. We good?

808
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:42,484
Yeah, we're good.

809
00:48:42,485 --> 00:48:44,328
- Of course we're good.
- All right.

810
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:07,209
<i>Thanks a lot for calling me
at two in the morning.</i>

811
00:49:07,210 --> 00:49:08,176
<i>I really appreciate it.</i>

812
00:49:08,177 --> 00:49:10,712
<i>Like I don't have a job
to wake up for tomorrow.</i>

813
00:49:10,713 --> 00:49:12,913
<i>Maybe next time you can't
remember where you live,</i>

814
00:49:12,914 --> 00:49:14,515
<i>you should ask your wife.</i>

815
00:49:14,516 --> 00:49:15,984
<i>I'm not sure what you were doing</i>

816
00:49:15,985 --> 00:49:19,921
<i>at two in the morning anyway,
but</i>

817
00:49:19,922 --> 00:49:21,790
<i>Hey, Bunny.
It's mama.</i>

818
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:24,459
<i>I was just thinking about
our conversation yesterday.</i>

819
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:25,826
<i>I don't know.</i>

820
00:49:25,827 --> 00:49:27,629
<i>You just didn't sound
like your usual self,</i>

821
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:29,864
<i>so I just wanted to be sure
you're okay...</i>

822
00:49:29,865 --> 00:49:32,600
<i>Hey, man. The street
you grew up on was Berkman.</i>

823
00:49:32,601 --> 00:49:34,201
<i>Hope that clears things up.</i>

824
00:49:34,202 --> 00:49:35,516
<i>Talk to you soon.</i>

825
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:47,582
Hey.

826
00:49:47,583 --> 00:49:49,584
- Hey.
- Um.

827
00:49:49,585 --> 00:49:52,053
So something really weird
just happened.

828
00:49:52,054 --> 00:49:56,124
I got a bunch of voice mails
from my mom and Doug and Dave

829
00:49:56,125 --> 00:50:00,462
saying I had called them
asking really weird questions,

830
00:50:00,463 --> 00:50:03,464
but I didn't call them.

831
00:50:03,465 --> 00:50:04,466
That is weird.

832
00:50:04,467 --> 00:50:05,734
Yeah.

833
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:08,035
Do you think
you pocket dialed them?

834
00:50:08,036 --> 00:50:10,671
I don't think the pocket dial
makes as much sense

835
00:50:10,672 --> 00:50:12,674
because I was talking
and asking questions.

836
00:50:12,675 --> 00:50:15,679
- I would have...
- So what do you think it was?

837
00:50:17,679 --> 00:50:20,816
Oh, you think
that he called them.

838
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:24,319
Yeah, and to me
that's a logical conclusion.

839
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,319
He looks like me.

840
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,488
He sounds like me.

841
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:27,823
He's got a cellphone.

842
00:50:27,824 --> 00:50:30,292
I think he might be
impersonating me or something.

843
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:33,528
Right. I-I just don't think that
he would do that.

844
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:36,464
Do you think
you know him that well?

845
00:50:36,465 --> 00:50:40,569
Well, I mean, I know him
a little better than you do.

846
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,305
You've never met him.

847
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,573
But I mean it's weird.

848
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,042
I can... I can totally
ask him if you want.

849
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:48,042
No, that's okay.

850
00:50:48,043 --> 00:50:49,743
<i>- It's just...
- Okay.</i>

851
00:50:49,744 --> 00:50:50,678
<i>- It's just a weird thing.
- Okay.</i>

852
00:50:50,679 --> 00:50:52,851
<i>It is weird.</i>

853
00:50:55,457 --> 00:50:56,984
I'm going to go to the store.

854
00:50:56,985 --> 00:50:58,687
Do you want me to
get you anything?

855
00:50:58,688 --> 00:51:00,455
No.

856
00:51:00,456 --> 00:51:01,723
I'm good.

857
00:51:01,724 --> 00:51:04,459
- Thanks.
- Well, you can come if you want.

858
00:51:04,460 --> 00:51:07,333
Do you mind
if I just hang out here?

859
00:51:10,188 --> 00:51:11,399
- Of course not.
- Okay.

860
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,688
Okay.

861
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:01,649
Hey, babe.

862
00:52:01,650 --> 00:52:03,584
Sorry.

863
00:52:03,585 --> 00:52:04,585
Great.

864
00:52:34,016 --> 00:52:35,649
Hey.

865
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:37,651
Is this a bad time?

866
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:38,720
No, no.

867
00:52:38,721 --> 00:52:42,393
I was doing some sit-ups.

868
00:52:45,393 --> 00:52:46,896
I need to talk to you.

869
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,163
What do you want to talk about?

870
00:52:49,164 --> 00:52:51,802
What happened
the last time I was here.

871
00:52:52,802 --> 00:52:56,104
Yeah, that was
obviously important.

872
00:52:56,105 --> 00:52:57,105
Yeah.

873
00:52:57,106 --> 00:52:59,674
Ethan, you're so good
at articulating

874
00:52:59,675 --> 00:53:03,245
exactly what it is
that I'm feeling

875
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,879
in a way that I can't even do,

876
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,250
and it's everything
that I've been wanting to hear,

877
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:10,752
but now I don't know what to do.

878
00:53:10,753 --> 00:53:13,795
I can't get it out of my head.

879
00:53:19,795 --> 00:53:22,263
Well, I'm glad I said

880
00:53:22,264 --> 00:53:24,371
what you wanted to hear,
you know.

881
00:53:29,371 --> 00:53:33,710
Is there anything else
you wanted to see me about?

882
00:53:48,724 --> 00:53:50,461
I've missed this.

883
00:53:53,461 --> 00:53:55,032
Me too.

884
00:55:02,697 --> 00:55:04,568
Hi.

885
00:55:06,568 --> 00:55:08,572
Where are the groceries?

886
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,939
What?

887
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:14,878
What about the store?
What happened?

888
00:55:15,878 --> 00:55:17,645
The store was closed.

889
00:55:17,646 --> 00:55:19,039
Oh.

890
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:47,744
Hey, how about I make us
a couple of mimosas?

891
00:55:49,744 --> 00:55:52,744
I'm not really in the mood
for a mimosa right now, Sophie.

892
00:55:53,014 --> 00:55:55,884
Aw, come on.
It'll be fun.

893
00:55:55,885 --> 00:55:57,517
We'll have a drink.
We'll relax.

894
00:55:58,019 --> 00:56:00,388
Start this day off right.

895
00:56:00,389 --> 00:56:03,161
Then we can talk about
whatever is bothering you.

896
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:08,163
You know,
that's really good advice.

897
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,835
And I should probably
listen to it...

898
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:14,976
But you're not a real person.

899
00:56:20,976 --> 00:56:22,815
You know you're not real.

900
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:27,583
Who the hell are you?

901
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,752
What the hell are you?
Are you a fucking robot?

902
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:36,323
Are you a...
like a spirit?

903
00:56:36,324 --> 00:56:39,928
Because I've got to say
it's bad enough

904
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:43,464
that I'm losing my wife
to a mirror image of me

905
00:56:43,465 --> 00:56:45,200
who happens to be
like 20% cooler

906
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:48,069
and 20% more emotionally
involved than me.

907
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:51,839
Now I have to sit
and look at a mirror image

908
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,878
of exactly who I'm losing.

909
00:56:55,878 --> 00:56:57,946
So, no...

910
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:01,683
I'm having a hard time enjoying this weekend
because this is the weekend I lose my wife.

911
00:57:01,684 --> 00:57:05,125
So, pardon me if I don't want
a fucking mimosa, okay?

912
00:57:10,125 --> 00:57:12,898
It wasn't just this weekend.

913
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:18,070
How do you know?

914
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,054
Because as your wife,
I know these things.

915
00:57:57,806 --> 00:57:59,789
Shit!

916
00:58:13,789 --> 00:58:14,821
Oh.

917
00:58:14,822 --> 00:58:15,957
- I can't stop it.
- Oooh!

918
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:16,958
I can't stop it.

919
00:58:17,025 --> 00:58:17,827
Look what you did.

920
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:18,827
Look what you did.

921
00:58:19,027 --> 00:58:20,027
Oooh!

922
00:58:22,498 --> 00:58:23,997
What? Souvenir?

923
00:58:23,998 --> 00:58:25,262
Here comes the firehose.

924
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,834
I'm going to spray you down.
Are you on fire?

925
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:30,072
You twirling firehose.

926
00:58:32,074 --> 00:58:35,076
Where did you get this sweater?

927
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:37,278
What?

928
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:39,180
Where'd you get this?

929
00:58:39,181 --> 00:58:40,881
I don't know.
I've always had it.

930
00:58:40,882 --> 00:58:43,051
- Really?
- Yeah, you just...

931
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:45,919
what, you don't notice
my clothes, I guess.

932
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,223
Do you remember when you got it?

933
00:58:49,224 --> 00:58:50,991
Do you want to
talk about clothes?

934
00:58:50,992 --> 00:58:55,696
Or would you rather have the
full Chippendales experience?

935
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:57,397
What's the full experience?

936
00:58:57,398 --> 00:58:58,566
Well...

937
00:58:58,567 --> 00:59:00,267
I don't think
I have enough cash on me.

938
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:01,234
You just put that away.

939
00:59:01,235 --> 00:59:02,657
You don't worry about that.

940
00:59:24,935 --> 00:59:26,093
Sophie, open the door.

941
00:59:26,094 --> 00:59:27,831
Come on. It's me.

942
00:59:29,746 --> 00:59:31,799
<i>I know you're in there
with him, Sophie.</i>

943
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,368
<i>Come on. Open up!</i>

944
00:59:34,369 --> 00:59:36,437
Will you just give
me... hold on one second.

945
00:59:36,438 --> 00:59:39,272
<i>Sophie, come on.
Let me in.</i>

946
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:40,975
<i>Sophie.</i>

947
00:59:40,976 --> 00:59:43,210
<i>I'm just going to keep knocking.</i>

948
00:59:43,211 --> 00:59:45,546
<i>I'm going to keep knocking.</i>

949
00:59:45,547 --> 00:59:46,948
<i>I know what you're
doing in there.</i>

950
00:59:46,949 --> 00:59:48,116
<i>I'm going to keep knocking.</i>

951
00:59:48,117 --> 00:59:49,817
Sophie, let me in.

952
00:59:49,818 --> 00:59:51,188
Come on, Sophie.
Open up.

953
00:59:53,778 --> 00:59:55,989
- Where is he?
- Ethan, what are you doing?

954
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:58,058
- Where are you?
- Ethan, come on.

955
00:59:58,059 --> 00:59:59,127
Ethan, stop!

956
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:00,408
I'll beat his ass.
Where are you?

957
01:00:00,596 --> 01:00:01,895
Where are you?

958
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:03,867
Goddamn it.

959
01:00:04,867 --> 01:00:05,710
Good. He's gone.

960
01:00:05,910 --> 01:00:07,401
What the hell
is going on in here?

961
01:00:07,402 --> 01:00:09,069
Where did he go?
Look what you did!

962
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,370
What I did? Are you insane?

963
01:00:10,371 --> 01:00:11,372
Yes, what you did.

964
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:13,576
What if he never comes back?

965
01:00:14,576 --> 01:00:16,076
Sophie, come on.

966
01:00:16,077 --> 01:00:18,145
Sophie, get back here.

967
01:00:18,146 --> 01:00:19,413
Sophie.

968
01:00:19,414 --> 01:00:21,549
He is not real, okay?

969
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:22,984
Sophie, how can you
accept something

970
01:00:22,985 --> 01:00:24,618
that you know is a blatant lie?

971
01:00:24,619 --> 01:00:26,620
You keep saying
it's not real, it's not real,

972
01:00:26,621 --> 01:00:28,023
but I'm happy.

973
01:00:29,023 --> 01:00:30,991
I'm feeling that.
How is that fake?

974
01:00:30,992 --> 01:00:33,326
Do you hear
how insane you sound?

975
01:00:33,327 --> 01:00:35,430
You're not admitting that this
is just the least bit weird?

976
01:00:35,431 --> 01:00:37,467
It's not weird for me anymore.

977
01:00:39,377 --> 01:00:40,535
So what's the endgame?

978
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,102
How do you see this playing out?

979
01:00:42,103 --> 01:00:45,073
Are you going to write letters, come back
and visit after we leave this weekend?

980
01:00:45,074 --> 01:00:46,112
I'm not leaving.

981
01:00:49,317 --> 01:00:51,212
What do you mean,
you're not leaving?

982
01:00:51,213 --> 01:00:53,915
Sophie, what the hell do you mean you're...

983
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:56,152
This is...
okay, all right.

984
01:00:57,152 --> 01:00:58,352
Sophie, come on.

985
01:00:58,353 --> 01:00:59,886
Let's just take
a breath here, okay?

986
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:04,258
I know you're feeling something that is
magical and clearly exciting to you,

987
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:06,160
but if you think about it
logically, literally

988
01:01:06,161 --> 01:01:07,940
for one second...

989
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,815
Is this weird for you now?

990
01:01:26,815 --> 01:01:30,218
Does anybody remember any of
those fun icebreaker games

991
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,621
that kids do at summer camp...

992
01:01:34,722 --> 01:01:39,493
Spin the bottle
or seven minutes in heaven or something...

993
01:01:39,494 --> 01:01:41,495
Anyhow, we just thought
it was time

994
01:01:41,496 --> 01:01:43,363
that the four of us sit down

995
01:01:43,364 --> 01:01:45,265
and get to know each other
a little bit.

996
01:01:45,266 --> 01:01:47,201
You want to get to
know each other?

997
01:01:47,202 --> 01:01:48,935
Hi, Sophie.

998
01:01:48,936 --> 01:01:50,173
Hi.

999
01:01:52,173 --> 01:01:53,306
Okay.

1000
01:01:53,307 --> 01:01:56,477
Um, let's get to
know each other.

1001
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:59,113
Why don't you tell us the truth
of what's really going on?

1002
01:01:59,114 --> 01:02:00,214
The truth?

1003
01:02:00,215 --> 01:02:02,649
Yeah, that you basically
have been pretending to be me,

1004
01:02:02,650 --> 01:02:04,285
acting like I don't exist even

1005
01:02:04,286 --> 01:02:06,721
though you knew
I was here the whole time.

1006
01:02:06,722 --> 01:02:10,124
Ethan, I wasn't
pretending to be anyone.

1007
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:12,392
I was just being myself.

1008
01:02:12,393 --> 01:02:14,361
You knew about me, right?

1009
01:02:14,362 --> 01:02:16,263
Did he mention me to you
at any point?

1010
01:02:16,264 --> 01:02:17,800
Not until this morning.

1011
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:20,468
<i>All right.
Maybe all of us</i>

1012
01:02:20,469 --> 01:02:23,270
<i>were doing a little pretending
this weekend.</i>

1013
01:02:23,271 --> 01:02:25,108
It's not a big deal.

1014
01:02:26,108 --> 01:02:28,241
I really like your shoes.

1015
01:02:28,242 --> 01:02:31,511
Oh, thank you.

1016
01:02:31,512 --> 01:02:34,314
I really like your hair
pinned back like that.

1017
01:02:34,315 --> 01:02:35,850
Super cute.

1018
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:40,354
I'm sorry. I-I-I still am not
buying that you are real.

1019
01:02:40,355 --> 01:02:43,390
<i>Ethan, I'm sitting here,</i>

1020
01:02:43,391 --> 01:02:44,959
you're looking at me
sitting here.

1021
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:46,227
I'm real.

1022
01:02:46,228 --> 01:02:48,095
<i>You're sitting across
from me, right?</i>

1023
01:02:48,096 --> 01:02:53,001
I'm looking at you sitting there,
so by your logic maybe you're not real.

1024
01:02:54,001 --> 01:02:56,271
That doesn't make any sense.

1025
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:58,471
I'm starving.

1026
01:02:58,472 --> 01:03:01,481
Ethan, why don't you clean yourself up
and we'll all have a little dinner.

1027
01:03:11,652 --> 01:03:12,652
There.

1028
01:03:14,456 --> 01:03:17,959
So, anybody interested
in going on a hike tomorrow?

1029
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,194
I've been wanting to do that
ever since we got here.

1030
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:21,562
I would love that.

1031
01:03:21,563 --> 01:03:23,196
<i>All right.</i>

1032
01:03:23,197 --> 01:03:25,332
Tonight though,
I'm thinking game night.

1033
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:26,600
All right.

1034
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:29,403
Okay, maybe you're real,
but can we admit

1035
01:03:29,404 --> 01:03:31,538
this isn't some normal
dinner party?

1036
01:03:31,539 --> 01:03:33,341
Ethan, you're looking
a little uncomfortable.

1037
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,508
Can I help you with something?

1038
01:03:34,509 --> 01:03:36,410
Okay, so according to you,

1039
01:03:36,411 --> 01:03:38,511
this is just
some average weekend.

1040
01:03:38,512 --> 01:03:39,946
We all go home tomorrow,

1041
01:03:39,947 --> 01:03:44,252
and you don't need any
further explanation than that?

1042
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,354
Sometimes these things
just happen.

1043
01:03:46,355 --> 01:03:48,293
Yeah, that's right.
They do.

1044
01:03:51,293 --> 01:03:52,293
I don't buy it.

1045
01:03:53,228 --> 01:03:54,662
<i>All right.</i>

1046
01:03:54,663 --> 01:03:56,464
One time I read this article
on cosmic occurrences.

1047
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,866
I wish I still had it...
you... you would love it.

1048
01:03:58,867 --> 01:04:01,435
And it basically says
that aberrations happen.

1049
01:04:01,436 --> 01:04:03,437
You can drive yourself nuts
trying to derive meaning

1050
01:04:03,438 --> 01:04:06,406
from things that have
no meaning to begin with.

1051
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:07,774
That's so interesting.

1052
01:04:07,775 --> 01:04:09,576
<i>It is, isn't it?</i>

1053
01:04:09,577 --> 01:04:11,345
It's not that interesting.

1054
01:04:11,346 --> 01:04:15,482
Let me think of an little example for you,
something right up your alley.

1055
01:04:15,483 --> 01:04:19,520
Um... Let's say
you buy a gorilla.

1056
01:04:19,521 --> 01:04:21,321
Excuse me?

1057
01:04:21,322 --> 01:04:23,457
Let's say you buy
a gorilla, Ethan.

1058
01:04:23,458 --> 01:04:25,526
You can't buy a gorilla.

1059
01:04:25,527 --> 01:04:28,562
I know that,
it was for the story.

1060
01:04:28,563 --> 01:04:33,200
But fine, let's say
you buy an aardvark, okay?

1061
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:36,270
You take that aardvark,
you put him in a dark room.

1062
01:04:36,271 --> 01:04:38,672
A minute later you flip that switch,
the lights come on.

1063
01:04:38,673 --> 01:04:40,441
Now we all know
how electricity works,

1064
01:04:40,442 --> 01:04:43,544
but for him it's a miracle.

1065
01:04:43,545 --> 01:04:44,812
Magic happened...

1066
01:04:44,813 --> 01:04:46,647
that previously dark room
is now illuminated

1067
01:04:46,648 --> 01:04:49,450
with possibilities
he's never seen before...

1068
01:04:49,451 --> 01:04:50,685
and what does he do?

1069
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:54,321
Does he ruin it
by questioning how or why?

1070
01:04:54,322 --> 01:04:57,460
No. He enjoys it.

1071
01:04:59,561 --> 01:05:02,395
Well, I'm not an aardvark.

1072
01:05:02,396 --> 01:05:04,570
And I am not a gorilla.

1073
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:10,344
Don't worry about it.
I got it.

1074
01:05:20,215 --> 01:05:21,582
Um.

1075
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:23,551
There a little bit left.

1076
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:24,701
Should we finish it?

1077
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:42,370
This is quite the situation.

1078
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:44,538
You can say that again.

1079
01:05:44,539 --> 01:05:48,743
Has Ethan...
I mean your Ethan...

1080
01:05:48,744 --> 01:05:51,611
have you guys
talked about anything

1081
01:05:51,612 --> 01:05:54,147
or has he said
anything to you at all?

1082
01:05:54,148 --> 01:05:55,649
Like what?

1083
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:58,953
Well, Ethan... my Ethan and I,
we know we've discussed it.

1084
01:05:58,954 --> 01:06:01,589
Like he knew when I was
going to go in the house

1085
01:06:01,590 --> 01:06:04,392
and I knew when he was
going to and...

1086
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:06,761
You shared your experiences.

1087
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:08,562
Yeah, for the most part.

1088
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:12,802
And you want to know
if we shared our experiences also.

1089
01:06:13,802 --> 01:06:16,169
Guess I'm just curious.

1090
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,306
I can see that.

1091
01:06:19,306 --> 01:06:22,209
You know what I'm curious about?

1092
01:06:22,210 --> 01:06:24,611
Are you more concerned
with the experiences

1093
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:27,247
that me and your Ethan shared

1094
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:29,417
or are you more concerned
with what I know

1095
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,523
about the experiences
that you and my Ethan shared?

1096
01:06:34,191 --> 01:06:35,823
Seems to me you care a lot more

1097
01:06:35,824 --> 01:06:38,429
about one of those scenarios
than the other.

1098
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:43,175
Are you going to give that back?

1099
01:06:54,175 --> 01:06:57,745
I say for the sake of
the super fun evening

1100
01:06:57,746 --> 01:07:02,049
we're about to have, let's keep it simple
and keep our cheery dispositions

1101
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:06,833
and I'll keep complimenting your shoes
and you can keep pretending

1102
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:08,689
that you like the way
I pin my hair back,

1103
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:12,032
and we'll just have a good time
and see what happens.

1104
01:07:17,032 --> 01:07:20,085
On second thought, do you mind
taking care of those dishes?

1105
01:07:24,706 --> 01:07:27,341
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

1106
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:28,642
Are we still doing this?

1107
01:07:28,643 --> 01:07:30,678
Are we going to compare
lists of women, too?

1108
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:34,614
You know, I'm starting to piece this
all together and see it for what it is.

1109
01:07:34,615 --> 01:07:37,118
You're trying to
sabotage my relationship.

1110
01:07:37,119 --> 01:07:39,787
Ethan, from what I understand
about your relationships,

1111
01:07:39,788 --> 01:07:44,524
you should be well versed
in the art of self-sabotage.

1112
01:07:44,525 --> 01:07:45,827
The purpose of tonight
is not to engage in

1113
01:07:46,027 --> 01:07:48,562
some warped competition
between us,

1114
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:50,430
at least not on my end.

1115
01:07:50,431 --> 01:07:52,500
It wouldn't really be fair.

1116
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:54,605
Yeah? Why is that?

1117
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,608
Haven't you figured it out yet?

1118
01:08:00,608 --> 01:08:01,875
It's kings.

1119
01:08:01,876 --> 01:08:03,743
It's kings or it's aces
is what's going on.

1120
01:08:03,744 --> 01:08:05,379
There's something going on.

1121
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:09,116
Why don't you worry
about your own cards.

1122
01:08:09,117 --> 01:08:10,817
I don't even know why
we're continuing right now.

1123
01:08:10,818 --> 01:08:13,520
I basically know
every card you're holding.

1124
01:08:13,521 --> 01:08:15,455
Are you saying
that I have a tell?

1125
01:08:15,456 --> 01:08:17,324
You have big tells.

1126
01:08:18,871 --> 01:08:20,661
You want to know
what your tell is?

1127
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:22,696
I want to know
what you think it is.

1128
01:08:22,697 --> 01:08:23,863
You have a very consistent

1129
01:08:23,864 --> 01:08:28,169
albeit very cute
Sophie shoulder shrug

1130
01:08:28,170 --> 01:08:31,538
that looks
a little bit like this.

1131
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:33,706
Ooh, do you do the shrug?

1132
01:08:33,707 --> 01:08:35,576
Excuse me.
Don't talk to her.

1133
01:08:35,577 --> 01:08:36,777
She's dead. She folded.

1134
01:08:36,778 --> 01:08:38,411
It's just you and me now.

1135
01:08:38,412 --> 01:08:39,446
You did the shoulder shrug.

1136
01:08:39,447 --> 01:08:40,848
You obviously have a good hand.

1137
01:08:40,849 --> 01:08:43,349
It's like a high pair
or maybe even three of a kind.

1138
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:44,518
Fucking raise this shit, man.

1139
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:45,920
You only live once.

1140
01:08:45,921 --> 01:08:48,522
Okay. I'll raise.

1141
01:08:48,523 --> 01:08:49,790
Now I know
you have the confidence.

1142
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,758
I have a shit hand.

1143
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:52,326
I'm folding.
Look at that.

1144
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:53,527
Jesus, are you kidding me?

1145
01:08:53,528 --> 01:08:55,763
- What?
- You're right.

1146
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:58,398
- Pair of aces.
- Ooh!

1147
01:08:58,399 --> 01:08:59,899
Nailed it, nailed it.

1148
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,164
I knew you had the aces.

1149
01:09:01,569 --> 01:09:04,404
Dude, by the way, you're getting
very good at this game...

1150
01:09:04,405 --> 01:09:05,438
almost too good.

1151
01:09:05,439 --> 01:09:07,823
I'm beginning to think this is
like one long Sophie con.

1152
01:09:09,476 --> 01:09:11,578
He clearly just let you win.

1153
01:09:11,579 --> 01:09:13,613
Yes, Ethan.
Obviously he let me win.

1154
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:14,648
Come on, guys.

1155
01:09:14,649 --> 01:09:17,617
This is supposed to just
be a friendly game.

1156
01:09:17,618 --> 01:09:19,553
You're not being very fun
to play with.

1157
01:09:19,554 --> 01:09:22,622
The reason he's not being fun
is because he's not even playing.

1158
01:09:22,623 --> 01:09:25,826
Ethan, if you want to win the game,
you've got to play some hands, okay?

1159
01:09:25,827 --> 01:09:27,898
That's just how it works.

1160
01:09:29,898 --> 01:09:33,367
All right.
Fine. I'll play.

1161
01:09:33,368 --> 01:09:35,035
Deal me in.
You and me.

1162
01:09:35,036 --> 01:09:35,836
Come on.

1163
01:09:35,837 --> 01:09:37,837
You want to play one on...

1164
01:09:37,838 --> 01:09:40,206
Okay. All right.
That's the spirit.

1165
01:09:40,207 --> 01:09:41,774
Come on, buddy.
Let's get in the game.

1166
01:09:41,775 --> 01:09:43,685
Let's go.

1167
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:51,986
All right.

1168
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,487
How many cards do you want?

1169
01:09:54,488 --> 01:09:55,589
I'm fine with what I have.

1170
01:09:55,590 --> 01:09:57,590
Thank you very much.

1171
01:09:57,591 --> 01:09:58,858
Sticking with what you have.

1172
01:09:58,859 --> 01:09:59,993
All right. I'll stick
with what I have, too.

1173
01:09:59,994 --> 01:10:01,765
What's your move?

1174
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:06,599
I'm all in.

1175
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:07,867
Oh!

1176
01:10:07,868 --> 01:10:10,304
All in, bold move!

1177
01:10:10,305 --> 01:10:11,705
But you've got to be
impulsive sometimes.

1178
01:10:11,706 --> 01:10:12,601
I really like it.

1179
01:10:12,801 --> 01:10:15,843
All right, so you're all in,
and now I've got to figure out

1180
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:17,745
what is your tell.

1181
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:21,816
<i>You've got that restless leg thing going on
but I think it's just nerves.</i>

1182
01:10:22,016 --> 01:10:25,853
You've been chewing on the lower lip a little
bit, but oh, I get ulcers in there, too,

1183
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:28,221
so maybe that's just
what that is.

1184
01:10:28,222 --> 01:10:29,456
<i>So weird lip...</i>

1185
01:10:29,457 --> 01:10:31,027
<i>Oh, oh shit!</i>

1186
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:34,396
Of course. There it is.

1187
01:10:35,396 --> 01:10:38,831
The guy who has nothing
and he knows it.

1188
01:10:38,832 --> 01:10:42,202
Sorry, buddy, but I've got to
call you on this one.

1189
01:10:42,203 --> 01:10:43,807
What you got?

1190
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:48,675
Whatever.

1191
01:10:48,676 --> 01:10:52,078
You have nothing and I
win with an ace high.

1192
01:10:52,079 --> 01:10:53,514
<i>Sorry about that, man.</i>

1193
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:56,719
It's fun playing with you, but you've
got to work on your bluffing skills.

1194
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:58,818
You win.

1195
01:10:58,819 --> 01:11:00,386
You're an amazing liar.

1196
01:11:00,387 --> 01:11:02,589
Congratulations
on being a shithead.

1197
01:11:02,590 --> 01:11:03,590
Whoa!

1198
01:11:03,591 --> 01:11:05,224
Ethan, just calm down.

1199
01:11:05,225 --> 01:11:06,859
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute. Wait.

1200
01:11:06,860 --> 01:11:08,429
I don't want to take
all the credit here.

1201
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,003
You're a pretty decent liar
yourself, right?

1202
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:18,037
What are you talking about?

1203
01:11:18,038 --> 01:11:19,806
Do you want to tell her
or should I?

1204
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,941
Is this necessary?

1205
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:23,077
I think it's important
that Sophie knows what's going on.

1206
01:11:23,078 --> 01:11:24,178
We're all friends here, right?

1207
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,813
Would everybody just tell me
what we're talking about?

1208
01:11:26,814 --> 01:11:27,814
What happened?

1209
01:11:28,015 --> 01:11:29,049
It's nothing.

1210
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:32,819
<i>All right, look,
Ethan was a little suspicious</i>

1211
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:34,487
that something
was going on between us,

1212
01:11:34,488 --> 01:11:37,491
so he decided to try
and figure it out for himself.

1213
01:11:37,492 --> 01:11:39,425
It was actually kind of
a brilliant move.

1214
01:11:39,426 --> 01:11:40,993
<i>He didn't go
to the grocery store.</i>

1215
01:11:40,994 --> 01:11:43,464
<i>He ended up sneaking
into the guest house,</i>

1216
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,698
<i>and in a strange
twist of events,</i>

1217
01:11:45,699 --> 01:11:48,969
he pretended to be me,

1218
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:52,840
so you actually slept with Ethan
instead of me.

1219
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:55,975
I can't fucking pretend
to be you... I am me.

1220
01:11:55,976 --> 01:11:58,045
You... what the fuck
are you talking about?

1221
01:11:58,046 --> 01:12:00,680
Just shut up!
Sophie, please.

1222
01:12:00,681 --> 01:12:02,752
That was you yesterday?

1223
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:05,085
Sweetheart...

1224
01:12:05,086 --> 01:12:07,987
<i>Basically, first he betrayed you</i>

1225
01:12:07,988 --> 01:12:09,822
<i>by sleeping with someone else</i>

1226
01:12:09,823 --> 01:12:12,859
and then he kind of betrayed you

1227
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:15,328
by sleeping with you.

1228
01:12:15,329 --> 01:12:16,162
Sorry, guys.

1229
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:20,134
I didn't want to make
like a thing here.

1230
01:12:20,135 --> 01:12:22,935
If you guys need
some space or something.

1231
01:12:22,936 --> 01:12:26,572
If you want to like take the guest house,
you'd be welcome.

1232
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:27,912
I'm not going anywhere.

1233
01:12:30,912 --> 01:12:33,891
No, I want you to leave.

1234
01:12:43,891 --> 01:12:46,894
<i>...If not,
leave a detailed message</i>

1235
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,369
<i>and I will return your call.</i>

1236
01:12:49,063 --> 01:12:50,330
Hey. It's Ethan.

1237
01:12:50,331 --> 01:12:52,433
Um, I'm really just calling
to thank you

1238
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:55,903
for your wonderful
recommendation this weekend.

1239
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,970
Maybe next session
you can send us

1240
01:12:57,971 --> 01:12:59,907
to a fucking holocaust museum.

1241
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,952
Thank you very much.

1242
01:13:27,568 --> 01:13:29,803
<i>Alright, so we have to
hit the keys at the exact</i>

1243
01:13:30,003 --> 01:13:32,773
<i>same time. This is
a strange exercise.</i>

1244
01:13:32,774 --> 01:13:33,774
<i>On three, okay?</i>

1245
01:13:34,007 --> 01:13:35,175
<i>One...</i>

1246
01:13:35,176 --> 01:13:36,643
<i>- All right.
- Two.</i>

1247
01:13:36,644 --> 01:13:38,386
<i>Three.</i>

1248
01:13:45,386 --> 01:13:47,955
<i>You met in Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1249
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:51,325
<i>We met in Scottsdale, Arizona.</i>

1250
01:13:51,326 --> 01:13:53,626
<i>Madison, you have
two sisters, right?</i>

1251
01:13:53,627 --> 01:13:55,429
<i>Yes, two sisters.</i>

1252
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,063
<i>I'm the middle child,
and my dad wasn't present.</i>

1253
01:13:57,064 --> 01:13:58,866
Why are you here?

1254
01:13:58,867 --> 01:14:00,399
<i>You were raised in a</i>

1255
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:03,877
<i>predominantly female household
and you had serious...</i>

1256
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:10,457
Ethan and Sophie.

1257
01:14:22,457 --> 01:14:23,863
Holy shit!

1258
01:14:34,868 --> 01:14:36,079
<i>All right.
Try it again.</i>

1259
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:38,639
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1260
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:40,206
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1261
01:14:40,207 --> 01:14:41,942
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1262
01:14:41,943 --> 01:14:43,876
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1263
01:14:43,877 --> 01:14:45,645
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1264
01:14:45,646 --> 01:14:47,480
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1265
01:14:47,481 --> 01:14:49,215
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1266
01:14:49,216 --> 01:14:51,184
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1267
01:14:51,185 --> 01:14:53,153
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1268
01:14:53,154 --> 01:14:54,987
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1269
01:14:54,988 --> 01:14:56,689
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1270
01:14:56,690 --> 01:14:58,125
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1271
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,192
<i>I am Ethan.</i>

1272
01:14:59,193 --> 01:15:00,160
What the hell is this?

1273
01:15:00,161 --> 01:15:01,228
<i>I am Sophie.</i>

1274
01:15:01,229 --> 01:15:02,962
<i>That's getting good.</i>

1275
01:15:02,963 --> 01:15:05,501
<i>You're almost ready.</i>

1276
01:15:31,893 --> 01:15:34,510
I never took that picture.

1277
01:15:49,510 --> 01:15:53,015
No, no, no, no.

1278
01:15:54,015 --> 01:15:55,816
No!

1279
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:57,554
What the...

1280
01:15:59,554 --> 01:16:00,786
Shit!

1281
01:16:00,787 --> 01:16:01,921
Somebody help!

1282
01:16:01,922 --> 01:16:03,090
Help!

1283
01:16:03,091 --> 01:16:04,825
Help! Sophie!

1284
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:06,158
Sophie, can you hear me?

1285
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:08,730
Sophie, I'm stuck.

1286
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:10,831
<i>Hey.</i>

1287
01:16:10,832 --> 01:16:12,866
Sophie?
Sophie, I'm in here.

1288
01:16:12,867 --> 01:16:14,300
Sophie, I'm in here.

1289
01:16:14,301 --> 01:16:16,706
Sophie! I'm stuck.

1290
01:16:48,317 --> 01:16:50,370
- What the...
- We don't have much time.

1291
01:16:50,371 --> 01:16:52,505
They think I'm out
picking fruit for breakfast.

1292
01:16:52,506 --> 01:16:54,675
What?

1293
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:58,144
Okay. A lot happened
last night after you left.

1294
01:16:58,145 --> 01:17:00,147
Do you know that you're Sophie?

1295
01:17:00,148 --> 01:17:01,214
Are you pretending?

1296
01:17:01,215 --> 01:17:02,249
I don't know, what's happening?

1297
01:17:02,250 --> 01:17:03,716
I'm not your wife.

1298
01:17:03,717 --> 01:17:05,885
Okay. What the fuck's
going on, and who are you?

1299
01:17:05,886 --> 01:17:07,554
He fell in love with her.

1300
01:17:07,555 --> 01:17:09,156
He's not supposed to
fall in love with her.

1301
01:17:09,157 --> 01:17:10,956
She's supposed to fall
out of love with you.

1302
01:17:10,957 --> 01:17:11,957
That's how this works.

1303
01:17:11,958 --> 01:17:13,292
That's how we get out.

1304
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:14,294
What the hell are you
talking about? I don't...

1305
01:17:14,295 --> 01:17:15,961
That's how we become you.

1306
01:17:15,962 --> 01:17:17,163
You become us?

1307
01:17:17,164 --> 01:17:19,933
Pitting you against each other
is the best way to break you down,

1308
01:17:19,934 --> 01:17:21,434
and then it's your turn to stay.

1309
01:17:21,435 --> 01:17:23,170
What the fu...
What the fuck?

1310
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,304
Oh, my God.

1311
01:17:24,305 --> 01:17:25,337
Did you try to
get out last night?

1312
01:17:25,338 --> 01:17:26,872
- Yes.
- You couldn't.

1313
01:17:26,873 --> 01:17:28,241
No.

1314
01:17:28,242 --> 01:17:31,844
That's because the closer we get to moving
on, the closer you get to not being able to.

1315
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:34,313
Do you remember when you first got here,
I was stuck here.

1316
01:17:34,314 --> 01:17:35,314
You had to come see me.

1317
01:17:35,315 --> 01:17:36,654
Now look.

1318
01:17:39,654 --> 01:17:41,153
Ethan.

1319
01:17:41,154 --> 01:17:42,656
Ethan, it's not going to work.

1320
01:17:42,657 --> 01:17:44,224
I have to be the one
to let you out.

1321
01:17:44,225 --> 01:17:45,858
Well, what? I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

1322
01:17:45,859 --> 01:17:47,294
I don't want to... I don't
want to be trapped here.

1323
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,462
- What do you...
- You're not trapped yet.

1324
01:17:49,463 --> 01:17:51,831
I can get you out.

1325
01:17:51,832 --> 01:17:54,334
Listen, only two people
can leave today.

1326
01:17:54,335 --> 01:17:57,938
I don't understand. Why would you help me if
you're trying to get yourself out of here?

1327
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:59,675
Because I love him.

1328
01:18:00,675 --> 01:18:03,728
And I'd rather be trapped here
than see him leave with her.

1329
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:08,482
So you have real feelings
like love and jealousy,

1330
01:18:08,483 --> 01:18:11,050
like a real person?

1331
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:12,823
I am real.

1332
01:18:15,183 --> 01:18:17,657
We should bring a couple
extra bottles of water.

1333
01:18:17,658 --> 01:18:20,292
This hike can be
a little strenuous.

1334
01:18:20,293 --> 01:18:22,828
How long is the hike?

1335
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:24,898
I was just thinking I should
probably check on Ethan.

1336
01:18:24,899 --> 01:18:26,899
- See if he's okay.
- It's only like an hour.

1337
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,202
Plus, I think it's good if he cools
down in the guest house, you know.

1338
01:18:30,203 --> 01:18:32,205
Hey, we're getting
ready to head out.

1339
01:18:32,206 --> 01:18:33,572
You want to get changed?

1340
01:18:33,573 --> 01:18:37,309
Well, all my clothes are back at
the guest house, and I agree.

1341
01:18:37,310 --> 01:18:39,446
I think we should give
Ethan his space.

1342
01:18:39,447 --> 01:18:41,046
I have an extra pair of shoes.

1343
01:18:41,047 --> 01:18:43,282
We're probably the same size.

1344
01:18:43,283 --> 01:18:45,417
Well, that's top's
really cute on you.

1345
01:18:45,418 --> 01:18:47,920
Do you have anything like that?

1346
01:18:47,921 --> 01:18:49,457
I have another one.

1347
01:18:50,457 --> 01:18:52,997
Come on, girls.
Let's go.

1348
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,364
They're just right in there,

1349
01:18:58,365 --> 01:19:00,901
the bottom drawer,
and there are some extra shoes.

1350
01:19:00,902 --> 01:19:02,135
Great.
Thanks so much.

1351
01:19:02,136 --> 01:19:04,737
Sure. Do you need
anything else?

1352
01:19:04,738 --> 01:19:08,375
Um, well, my toothpaste
and toothbrush is over there.

1353
01:19:08,376 --> 01:19:09,509
Do you have anything?

1354
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,416
Sure, I'll get you something.

1355
01:19:15,133 --> 01:19:16,818
Just give me one minute, please.

1356
01:19:17,018 --> 01:19:18,189
It's important.

1357
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:24,560
Hey. Did you find
some clothes for her?

1358
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:28,728
Yep. She'll be down
in a minute.

1359
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:29,729
Good.

1360
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:32,198
What? Do you understand how

1361
01:19:32,199 --> 01:19:33,800
insane you sound right now?

1362
01:19:33,801 --> 01:19:36,469
Yes, I understand, but this whole
fucking weekend has been crazy.

1363
01:19:36,470 --> 01:19:38,371
Think about it. Everything
they knew about us...

1364
01:19:38,372 --> 01:19:40,439
the missing clothes
and the phone calls

1365
01:19:40,440 --> 01:19:42,175
to my mom and my friends.

1366
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:47,284
This entire weekend has been
one planned trap, Sophie.

1367
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:55,054
I'm glad we have a second
alone...

1368
01:19:55,055 --> 01:19:57,456
because I wanted to talk to you.

1369
01:19:57,457 --> 01:19:59,394
You do, really?

1370
01:20:00,394 --> 01:20:02,431
I want to talk to you, too.

1371
01:20:04,431 --> 01:20:06,299
What do you want to say?

1372
01:20:06,300 --> 01:20:08,171
You go first.

1373
01:20:10,171 --> 01:20:13,039
I've been thinking a lot
about things.

1374
01:20:16,510 --> 01:20:18,413
I don't want to leave
with Ethan.

1375
01:20:20,413 --> 01:20:22,353
I want to leave with you.

1376
01:20:25,353 --> 01:20:27,291
I want to leave with you, too.

1377
01:20:30,291 --> 01:20:31,291
I love you, Sophie.

1378
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:51,278
You're not Sophie.

1379
01:20:54,081 --> 01:20:55,585
Where is she?

1380
01:20:57,585 --> 01:20:58,585
Where is she?

1381
01:21:02,256 --> 01:21:04,124
Sophie?

1382
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,126
Come here.

1383
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,962
<i>Sophie?</i>

1384
01:21:08,962 --> 01:21:10,647
Here, come in here,
come in here.

1385
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:12,431
Sophie?

1386
01:21:15,336 --> 01:21:18,103
Look, I don't have
a lot of time, okay?

1387
01:21:18,104 --> 01:21:19,305
<i>Sophie.</i>

1388
01:21:19,306 --> 01:21:21,942
And I'm not going to get this right,
but I don't want you to leave.

1389
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:23,609
I don't want you
to leave me, Sophie.

1390
01:21:23,610 --> 01:21:27,015
Look, I know he is handsome
and smart and eloquent,

1391
01:21:28,015 --> 01:21:30,884
and he makes cool
aardvark metaphors, okay?

1392
01:21:30,885 --> 01:21:32,484
<i>Sophie!
You know I love you.</i>

1393
01:21:32,485 --> 01:21:35,023
And I'm difficult,
and I'm stubborn

1394
01:21:36,023 --> 01:21:39,425
and I know
that I've been defensive,

1395
01:21:39,426 --> 01:21:43,196
and I haven't been
what you needed...

1396
01:21:43,197 --> 01:21:44,531
<i>Sophie!</i>

1397
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,666
And I take a big part of the responsibility
for why this happened, okay?

1398
01:21:46,667 --> 01:21:48,168
But listen to me,

1399
01:21:50,270 --> 01:21:55,274
I'm your husband, and
you're my wife...

1400
01:21:55,275 --> 01:21:57,277
and I am not letting you go.

1401
01:21:57,278 --> 01:21:59,511
<i>Sophie, unlock the door.</i>

1402
01:21:59,512 --> 01:22:03,515
We're a mess, and I love that about us,
and I don't want to be perfect.

1403
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:05,352
I want to be us.
So please...

1404
01:22:05,353 --> 01:22:06,952
<i>Sophie, he's lying.</i>

1405
01:22:06,953 --> 01:22:10,924
Just give me a chance
before he comes in here.

1406
01:22:10,925 --> 01:22:11,958
I love you.

1407
01:22:16,430 --> 01:22:18,732
Sophie, what is he telling you?

1408
01:22:18,733 --> 01:22:21,367
Sophie, Sophie, it's me.

1409
01:22:21,368 --> 01:22:22,434
Come on. Sophie...

1410
01:22:22,435 --> 01:22:23,769
We're leaving. Okay.

1411
01:22:23,770 --> 01:22:26,841
Ethan, I need you to step out
of the way, please.

1412
01:22:27,841 --> 01:22:28,942
Excuse me.

1413
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:30,179
Ethan.

1414
01:22:32,179 --> 01:22:34,480
- Excuse me.
- Ethan!

1415
01:22:34,481 --> 01:22:35,681
You son of a bitch.

1416
01:22:35,682 --> 01:22:37,953
Ethan, stop!

1417
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:40,653
Stop it!

1418
01:22:40,654 --> 01:22:42,323
Ethan, stop it!

1419
01:22:43,323 --> 01:22:44,390
<i>You guys, come on.</i>

1420
01:22:44,391 --> 01:22:46,259
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1421
01:22:46,260 --> 01:22:47,966
Sophie.

1422
01:22:52,966 --> 01:22:54,634
All right.

1423
01:22:54,635 --> 01:22:57,370
That was a stupid fight.

1424
01:22:57,371 --> 01:22:59,640
Sophie, come on.

1425
01:23:04,011 --> 01:23:05,189
Sophie!

1426
01:23:15,189 --> 01:23:16,728
Fine.

1427
01:23:20,728 --> 01:23:22,360
I'm going to fuck all you guys.

1428
01:23:49,934 --> 01:23:51,724
What happens if
he can't catch him?

1429
01:23:51,725 --> 01:23:52,725
I have no idea.

1430
01:23:53,027 --> 01:23:54,998
Ethan!

1431
01:23:58,998 --> 01:24:00,270
Ethan!

1432
01:24:48,314 --> 01:24:49,841
We've got to get out of here.

1433
01:24:51,318 --> 01:24:52,318
We've got to go.

1434
01:25:40,167 --> 01:25:43,436
<i>Leave a detailed message
and I will return your call.</i>

1435
01:25:44,404 --> 01:25:45,537
<i>Hey, it's Ethan.</i>

1436
01:25:45,538 --> 01:25:46,773
<i>I know you're dodging my calls.</i>

1437
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:51,447
<i>I also know you know what's going on,
so we're coming over there right now.</i>

1438
01:26:21,242 --> 01:26:24,443
It was a full-on
grand theft covers.

1439
01:26:24,444 --> 01:26:25,411
I need a visual.

1440
01:26:25,412 --> 01:26:26,679
Look at this.
Come see.

1441
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:28,982
You were basically
a tootsie roll,

1442
01:26:28,983 --> 01:26:32,218
wrapped up,
rolled over onto your side,

1443
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:35,220
and you abandoned me
on the other side of the bed

1444
01:26:35,221 --> 01:26:36,889
and I froze my titties off
all night.

1445
01:26:36,890 --> 01:26:38,090
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

1446
01:26:38,091 --> 01:26:39,892
That's what you did to me,
your husband.

1447
01:26:39,893 --> 01:26:41,193
That's horrible.

1448
01:26:41,194 --> 01:26:41,995
It really is.

1449
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:42,961
What kind of a wife is that?

1450
01:26:42,962 --> 01:26:43,962
I don't know.
You're awful.

1451
01:26:43,963 --> 01:26:45,230
You owe me big time.

1452
01:26:45,231 --> 01:26:46,633
Why didn't you just
take the covers back?

1453
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:48,768
Because you looked really cute
and I didn't want to wake you up.

1454
01:26:48,769 --> 01:26:50,737
Right.
No, that makes sense...

1455
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,742
I must have been pretty cute.

1456
01:26:54,742 --> 01:26:58,745
That was um, that was pretty good, but you're
going to have to do a little more than that.

1457
01:26:58,746 --> 01:27:00,479
- More?
- I need something else.

1458
01:27:00,480 --> 01:27:01,480
Something else?

1459
01:27:01,948 --> 01:27:08,287
What would you say
if I made you breakfast?

1460
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,855
I'm not going to say
anything more.

1461
01:27:09,856 --> 01:27:11,624
I'm just going to try to
let this happen.

1462
01:27:11,625 --> 01:27:12,759
- Okay.
- No sudden movements.

1463
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,559
Be very still.

1464
01:27:14,560 --> 01:27:16,429
Sh-h-h-h!

1465
01:27:16,430 --> 01:27:17,462
- I'm not...
- Be very still.

1466
01:27:17,463 --> 01:27:18,598
I don't want to...

1467
01:27:18,599 --> 01:27:20,899
Nothing is happening.

1468
01:27:20,900 --> 01:27:22,735
Don't even make eye contact.

1469
01:27:36,617 --> 01:27:38,302
All right,
so what's on the menu?

1470
01:27:39,019 --> 01:27:42,708
Well, I was thinking
maybe eggs and bacon.
