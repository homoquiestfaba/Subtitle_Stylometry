1
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:43,100
All of you want chocolate?
l'll see what l can do.

2
00:00:43,274 --> 00:00:44,970
Roberto! Excuse me.

3
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:53,682
Happy Thanksgiving. All the best.
Happy Thanksgiving. God bless you.

4
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,590
Happy Thanksgiving. All the very best.

5
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:02,662
Bless you.

6
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:07,941
Happy Thanksgiving.

7
00:01:21,797 --> 00:01:23,026
Get the police.

8
00:02:16,544 --> 00:02:17,772
Get on the radio.

9
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:22,782
Coming through!

10
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:28,354
BP's 80/40.
He's already had a liter of D5W.

11
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:32,466
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.
Get the priest into C, now.

12
00:02:32,634 --> 00:02:36,663
-Who's the perp?
-Benjamin Mears, age 37. New York license.

13
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:40,278
-Hold him in A.
-A, as in abused by a priest?

14
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,690
lt hurt a bit?

15
00:02:50,694 --> 00:02:54,632
Well, that's nothing compared to the fires
you'll face on Judgment Day.

16
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,762
Now, let's see what we have here.

17
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,264
Hey, buddy. Wake up.

18
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,508
Yeah, that's it.

19
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,809
Now give me one good reason why...

20
00:03:06,984 --> 00:03:10,319
...as a good Christian,
l shouldn't let you die right here.

21
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:15,121
Jerusalem's Lot.

22
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:04,831
<i>No one pronounced Jerusalem's Lot dead</i>
<i>on the morning of February 6th.</i>

23
00:04:05,004 --> 00:04:06,972
<i>No one knew it was.</i>

24
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,572
<i>By and large, the town,</i>
<i>not knowing it was dead...</i>

25
00:04:10,745 --> 00:04:13,682
<i>...would go off to their jobs</i>
<i>with no inkling...</i>

26
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,579
<i>...of what lay ahead.</i>

27
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:20,620
<i>Looking at Jerusalem's Lot...</i>

28
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,854
<i>...is like peering through</i>
<i>a pane of ice at your childhood.</i>

29
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:28,265
<i>It's wavy and misty,</i>
<i>but most of it's the same.</i>

30
00:04:31,475 --> 00:04:33,376
<i>McDougall!</i>

31
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:39,677
<i>Lawrence Crockett is the richest man</i>
<i>in Salem's Lot, but the IRS will never know.</i>

32
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,650
<i>Like his neighbors, he relies on</i>
<i>the community to keep his secrets.</i>

33
00:04:44,828 --> 00:04:48,197
<i>The social pact is the foundation</i>
<i>of every small town.</i>

34
00:04:48,367 --> 00:04:51,667
Macy, tell Richard Straker
l'll be 1 0 minutes late.

35
00:04:52,306 --> 00:04:56,004
oh, a Mr. Mears stopped by.

36
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:59,445
-l told him you'd be out at the trailer park.
-Mears?

37
00:04:59,617 --> 00:05:02,246
Balls. The writer.
You told him l was here?

38
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,381
<i>I'm sorry, Larry.</i> Y<i>ou have to tell me</i>
<i>when you're hiding.</i>

39
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:09,018
Larry?

40
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:12,191
Ben Mears. Can l interest you
in a mobile home?

41
00:05:12,369 --> 00:05:14,702
Great little place to raise a family.

42
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,674
l'll just take the keys
to the house, thanks.

43
00:05:18,044 --> 00:05:20,138
-Still living in New York City?
-Yeah.

44
00:05:20,314 --> 00:05:22,215
l was, till l sublet my place.

45
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:26,814
l saw the Marsten house
from the road. lt's empty, right?

46
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:29,360
No, l sold it. l'm sorry.

47
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:32,588
Finally did. Same people
who bought the Laundromat.

48
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:36,203
l have an agreement to rent that.
l have the paperwork in my car.

49
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,998
So sue me. l'm sorry.

50
00:05:38,173 --> 00:05:41,906
Look, Eva Prunier runs a clean
boarding house on Clift Street.

51
00:05:42,079 --> 00:05:43,444
Who would buy that house?

52
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:47,382
-Two gentlemen, antique dealers.
-And they're aware of its story?

53
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:50,752
-l suppose. How could they not be?
-But you didn't tell them.

54
00:05:50,925 --> 00:05:53,622
-l don't remember.
-But you remember our agreement.

55
00:05:53,796 --> 00:05:57,564
What do you want me to say, Mr. Mears?
The deal is done.

56
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:03,743
Would you mind moving your car?

57
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:10,211
<i>Go on, Mears.</i> Y<i>ou wanna be</i>
<i>a Bloody Pirate, don't you?</i>

58
00:06:10,387 --> 00:06:12,618
<i>Come on, Mears.</i>
W<i>e've all been inside.</i>

59
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:14,122
Y<i>ou a wuss or a Pirate?</i>

60
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:20,495
<i>The town has secrets,</i>
<i>but sees through lies...</i>

61
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:23,104
<i>...even the ones you tell yourself.</i>

62
00:06:23,272 --> 00:06:26,869
W<i>hat are you doing coming back</i>
<i>to the place where you lived as a boy?</i>

63
00:06:27,045 --> 00:06:30,277
<i>Trying to recapture something</i>
<i>that was irrevocably lost?</i>

64
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,219
W<i>hat magic do you e</i>x<i>pect to recapture</i>
<i>by walking roads you once walked?</i>

65
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:38,122
<i>They're now probably asphalted...</i>

66
00:06:38,294 --> 00:06:39,592
<i>...and straightened...</i>

67
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:43,891
<i>...and litter-shot with tourist beer cans.</i>

68
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:46,870
<i>Do you even know?</i>

69
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:54,617
<i>The kids who ride Charlie Rhodes'</i>
<i>school bus are the best-behaved in town.</i>

70
00:06:54,786 --> 00:06:59,157
<i>In the entire school district, for that matter.</i>
<i>Charlie Rhodes is a bitter vet...</i>

71
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:03,354
<i>...who runs his bus the same way</i>
<i>he ran Kilo Company in Da Nang.</i>

72
00:07:03,532 --> 00:07:07,231
<i>Living proof that time</i>
<i>does not heal all wounds.</i>

73
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:11,198
You got a lot to talk about?

74
00:07:14,214 --> 00:07:15,511
Take it outside.

75
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:23,491
<i>Don't romanticize the town</i>
<i>because it's small.</i>

76
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,656
<i>Or because you fished its waters</i>
<i>for pickerel and steelies as a boy.</i>

77
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:30,497
<i>This town knows darkness.</i>

78
00:07:31,673 --> 00:07:33,369
You can't find them, grind them.

79
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,982
Who said that?

80
00:07:45,627 --> 00:07:46,855
Champ.

81
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:49,260
<i>The town knows darkness...</i>

82
00:07:49,432 --> 00:07:51,994
<i>...and the poor kids, like Mark Petrie...</i>

83
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,533
<i>...know more than their village peers</i>
<i>about the darkness of the human soul.</i>

84
00:07:57,077 --> 00:07:58,739
Surprise, surprise.

85
00:07:59,914 --> 00:08:03,044
<i>Salem's Lot is an accumulation</i>
<i>of three parts.</i>

86
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:04,311
Ass-wipe!

87
00:08:04,487 --> 00:08:07,458
<i>The sum of which</i>
<i>are greater than their whole.</i>

88
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:12,594
What the hell are you two
making all those signs for?

89
00:08:12,766 --> 00:08:15,429
He got my hat. He won't give it back.

90
00:08:15,604 --> 00:08:19,975
<i>The town is the people, the buildings</i>
<i>they've erected to den or do business in.</i>

91
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:22,306
There you go. Problem solved.

92
00:08:23,515 --> 00:08:25,177
<i>And it is the land.</i>

93
00:08:27,788 --> 00:08:30,155
Screw Charlie Rhodes.
l'd walk every day...

94
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:33,125
...if my mother wasn't tweaked
about the ''preverts.''

95
00:08:33,297 --> 00:08:35,823
You meet a lot of preverts, Ralphie?

96
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,935
More than l know. Look at Charlie...

97
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:41,302
...a normal jagoff, till you look under
the visor of his bus.

98
00:08:41,475 --> 00:08:43,842
-Shut up.
-l know kids who've seen them.

99
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:46,943
-Seen what?
-Pictures. Porn.

100
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:48,482
Charlieprevert.com.

101
00:08:48,652 --> 00:08:50,746
Dude, we gotta check this, all right?

102
00:08:50,922 --> 00:08:53,983
We'll hook up tonight,
see how Charlie gets his rocks off.

103
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:55,924
Hey, Petrie....

104
00:08:58,601 --> 00:09:01,298
<i>The people are Scotch,</i>
<i>English and French.</i>

105
00:09:03,874 --> 00:09:05,467
<i>There are others, of course...</i>

106
00:09:05,644 --> 00:09:10,345
<i>...a smattering, like a fistful of pepper</i>
<i>thrown in a bucket of salt.</i>

107
00:09:10,517 --> 00:09:13,420
<i>Matt Burke teaches English</i>
<i>at the high school...</i>

108
00:09:13,589 --> 00:09:15,216
<i>...and is a life-long bachelor.</i>

109
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:16,654
-Morning, Matt.
-Morning.

110
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:19,923
<i>Matt's alternative life</i>
<i>in Portland is tolerated...</i>

111
00:09:20,099 --> 00:09:22,660
<i>...so long as he keeps it</i>
<i>out of the classroom.</i>

112
00:09:22,836 --> 00:09:26,274
<i>The buildings here are nearly all</i>
<i>constructed of honest wood.</i>

113
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:30,607
<i>And when I was a boy,</i>
<i>it was largely agreed that Hubie Marsten...</i>

114
00:09:30,781 --> 00:09:33,615
<i>...built the finest home</i>
<i>in Jerusalem's Lot...</i>

115
00:09:33,785 --> 00:09:36,311
<i>...before going soft in the attic.</i>

116
00:09:40,962 --> 00:09:42,521
Mr. Mears?

117
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,365
Mr. Mears, l'm Susan Norton.

118
00:09:45,536 --> 00:09:49,200
We traded e-mails a few years back.
You probably don't remember.

119
00:09:49,374 --> 00:09:53,278
l went to Boston University and couldn't
decide between art and English.

120
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,640
-Please, sit.
-lf l'm not bothering you.

121
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:56,842
Not at all.

122
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,021
-So what'd you choose?
-Art.

123
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,453
Nothing against writing.

124
00:10:01,626 --> 00:10:04,425
Everyone knows you grew up here.
l found it inspiring.

125
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:08,232
-oh, thank you.
-l lived in New York for a year after school.

126
00:10:08,402 --> 00:10:11,464
But l couldn't paint the rent.
So l'm home reevaluating.

127
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:13,974
New York's for artists
with generous parents.

128
00:10:14,144 --> 00:10:18,776
And the Lot is for hobbyists who paint
lighthouses and lobster boats.

129
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:22,013
l wish you'd been more persistent
with your e-mails, Susan.

130
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,453
Because l'm interesting or blonde?

131
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,462
Because you're an interesting blonde.

132
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,732
-What brings you back?
-Work.

133
00:10:31,903 --> 00:10:35,636
A new book.
<i>Boring People in the Perfect Town</i>?

134
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,870
lt surrounds the Marsten house,
but l'm not telling anyone.

135
00:10:39,048 --> 00:10:40,675
A haunted house.
Not your genre.

136
00:10:41,184 --> 00:10:43,676
Complex characters can elevate genre.

137
00:10:43,855 --> 00:10:48,089
Hubie Marsten, a respected pillar
of the community until the moment...

138
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:51,288
...he blew his wife away
and hung himself from a rafter.

139
00:10:51,465 --> 00:10:53,400
Small-town Shakespeare.

140
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:56,965
You are the one who found them.

141
00:10:58,276 --> 00:10:59,607
Yes.

142
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,650
-l tried to rent the place.
-You actually wanted to live there?

143
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:06,582
Yeah, it's my...

144
00:11:06,754 --> 00:11:09,088
...attraction-repulsion compulsion.

145
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,490
Kinky things went on
in that place in Hubie's day.

146
00:11:13,665 --> 00:11:15,292
l heard.

147
00:11:15,768 --> 00:11:18,465
-You met the owners?
-Two guys. l hope they're gay.

148
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,541
lt might alleviate
some of the gossip off me.

149
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,535
Can l get you something?

150
00:11:23,712 --> 00:11:26,877
Hello. l'm Susan's mother.

151
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:31,282
lt's good to meet both of you.

152
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,159
Susan Norton, Norton's Cafe.

153
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:37,697
l'm slinging latte here
till l can move back to New York.

154
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:42,772
l think that building you mentioned might be
a metaphor for something bigger in your life.

155
00:11:42,941 --> 00:11:45,172
Does it always have to be
something bigger?

156
00:11:45,745 --> 00:11:47,303
Like a theme?

157
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:49,540
There would be if it were my book.

158
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,718
<i>The land is granite-bodied.</i>

159
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:56,452
<i>Farming it is a thankless,</i>
<i>miserable business.</i>

160
00:11:57,896 --> 00:12:00,924
You sure you wanna live out here, Dud?
lt's getting cold.

161
00:12:01,101 --> 00:12:04,503
l got a stove in the shack, Mike.
l'm all right.

162
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:07,006
We need the leaves
and tree cutting for fill.

163
00:12:07,177 --> 00:12:09,408
-Don't burn them.
-l won't burn them, Mike.

164
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,675
-What you got there?
-He must have got thirsty.

165
00:12:12,851 --> 00:12:15,413
-Hey, put that down.
-lt's for my girlfriend.

166
00:12:15,589 --> 00:12:17,956
You got a girlfriend now? Who?

167
00:12:18,126 --> 00:12:19,354
Let's go, gimp!

168
00:12:19,527 --> 00:12:21,291
-Who?
-l can't say!

169
00:12:21,464 --> 00:12:22,898
okay, Floyd!

170
00:12:23,066 --> 00:12:26,469
You better toss it away anyway.
She'll think you're a freak!

171
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,907
<i>The Rogers family ran a dairy here</i>
<i>for generations till Dud was born.</i>

172
00:12:31,078 --> 00:12:34,378
<i>It was sold to the town,</i>
<i>which built the hospital Dud needs...</i>

173
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,111
<i>...but can't visit without insurance.</i>

174
00:12:40,158 --> 00:12:42,491
-Royce, could you excuse us, please?
-Why?

175
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:45,565
<i>This is what Sandy McDougall</i>
<i>gave up high school for.</i>

176
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,202
Your son has a significant contusion.

177
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,202
l wanna talk to Sandy about it...

178
00:12:50,373 --> 00:12:51,670
...alone.

179
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:56,846
<i>A winter malaise is epidemic</i>
<i>in small towns.</i>

180
00:12:57,016 --> 00:13:00,852
<i>Dr. James Cody fights it</i>
<i>with fine dining and new clothes.</i>

181
00:13:01,723 --> 00:13:04,990
<i>Others self-medicate with alcohol</i>
<i>and television.</i>

182
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:11,401
Little Roy hasn't had breakfast.

183
00:13:15,978 --> 00:13:17,469
What happened, Sandy?

184
00:13:18,982 --> 00:13:22,613
l turned my back for a second,
and he fell off the changing table.

185
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:26,082
lt's the truth.

186
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:31,060
Sandy, how long
have you been married, now?

187
00:13:31,233 --> 00:13:32,701
Six months.

188
00:13:32,869 --> 00:13:34,963
Still live in Crockett's trailer park?

189
00:13:35,373 --> 00:13:37,934
Not having money
doesn't make us bad parents.

190
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,578
No, of course not.

191
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:44,214
Sandy, l'm required by law
to report this type of injury.

192
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:48,019
-lt's not what you think, Jimmy.
-lt's not?

193
00:13:49,359 --> 00:13:50,588
Sandy, was it Royce?

194
00:13:50,762 --> 00:13:54,222
Look, this marriage isn't all l thought,
but little Roy's okay.

195
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:58,164
We had some fun times didn't we?

196
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,639
Dancing? New Year's at Dell's?

197
00:14:01,477 --> 00:14:04,539
Please, don't report it. Give us a chance.

198
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,780
Bring the baby back tomorrow.

199
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,752
You're a good man, Jimmy.

200
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:15,955
And a good doctor.

201
00:14:17,334 --> 00:14:19,165
lf l'd been a little smarter...

202
00:14:19,871 --> 00:14:22,102
...or drunker that New Year's...

203
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,676
...who knows?

204
00:14:26,181 --> 00:14:28,480
Y<i>ou stay because</i>
<i>a small town knows you...</i>

205
00:14:28,651 --> 00:14:33,181
<i>...and thereby owns you. Sure as the bank,</i>
<i>the car dealer and the Sears in Livingston.</i>

206
00:14:34,993 --> 00:14:39,398
The kitchen is available to all guests
from 5 a.m. to 9 p.m.

207
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,866
Fresh sheets are provided weekly...

208
00:14:42,037 --> 00:14:44,973
...and rents are negotiable
for those who wanna work.

209
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:54,579
Do you have a room with a view?

210
00:14:55,022 --> 00:14:56,251
oh, yes, l do.

211
00:14:56,425 --> 00:14:58,860
Would you believe it's
my hardest room to rent?

212
00:14:59,028 --> 00:15:02,123
Ed, a moment please.
Mr. Mears will be staying with us.

213
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,892
-For a few weeks.
-Pleasure.

214
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,470
Most tourists leave
soon as their tank's full.

215
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,600
l grew up in the Lot as a child
with my Aunt Cynthia. Cynthia Stowens.

216
00:15:11,113 --> 00:15:13,275
l knew Cynthia.

217
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:16,284
-You're her nephew?
-That's right.

218
00:15:16,454 --> 00:15:20,017
-The boy who was in the Marsten house?
-l am.

219
00:15:20,426 --> 00:15:23,123
You're the one who found Hubie
and his wife, Birdie?

220
00:15:24,599 --> 00:15:27,467
Goddamn. You were a ballsy little fella.

221
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:30,200
Please, come and look.

222
00:15:31,543 --> 00:15:34,412
Some of the men are building me
a rec room.

223
00:15:34,581 --> 00:15:37,380
Gentlemen, this is Ben Mears.

224
00:15:37,552 --> 00:15:39,350
Mr. Mears used to live in the Lot.

225
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,353
l know Mr. Mears.

226
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,720
You ever write a book
about Afghanistan?

227
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:46,854
-l did.
-Waste of paper, that was.

228
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:50,060
-oh, Mr. Blair.
-That's okay. l'm glad somebody read it.

229
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:55,040
Civilian casualties aren't avoidable
in combat. l was in the Corps '64 to '70.

230
00:15:55,211 --> 00:15:57,680
Tourists like yourself writing
about war...

231
00:15:57,847 --> 00:16:01,478
...are naive, dangerous,
borderline traitorous.

232
00:16:01,653 --> 00:16:04,715
-What do you think about war crimes?
-War crimes, my ass.

233
00:16:05,159 --> 00:16:08,493
There's three good Marines rotting
in Leavenworth right now...

234
00:16:08,664 --> 00:16:11,259
...because of Mr. Ben Mears.

235
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:23,074
<i>Beneath the postcard camouflage,</i>
<i>there's little good in small towns.</i>

236
00:16:23,252 --> 00:16:28,056
<i>Mostly boredom, interspersed</i>
<i>with a dull, mindless, moronic evil.</i>

237
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,955
l love them.

238
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,861
l just love these brick walls.

239
00:16:35,436 --> 00:16:37,462
Lawrence, son...

240
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,336
...l called you over an hour ago.

241
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:43,811
My secretary screwed up.

242
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:47,119
Fire her. She makes you look bad.

243
00:16:47,288 --> 00:16:48,516
Thanks.

244
00:16:48,689 --> 00:16:51,215
The shop looks good, Mr. Straker.

245
00:16:51,393 --> 00:16:54,626
Well, the truth be told,
we don't really need it.

246
00:16:54,798 --> 00:16:57,700
Ninety-five percent of our business
is done online.

247
00:16:58,437 --> 00:17:01,100
Well, that explains opening in November.

248
00:17:01,274 --> 00:17:04,871
Weather is regional. We are global.

249
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,538
Madam!

250
00:17:06,716 --> 00:17:10,209
What a beautiful-looking letterbox.

251
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,350
My father made it by hand.

252
00:17:12,524 --> 00:17:15,791
Well, your father is a fine craftsman.

253
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:17,529
l will give you...

254
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,097
...1 0 dollars to keep it.

255
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:21,760
You just turn around and take it back.

256
00:17:21,938 --> 00:17:27,105
But if you insist,
l will buy that box from you for...

257
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:31,248
...$60, and l will find
a good home for it.

258
00:17:32,187 --> 00:17:33,984
l need the money.

259
00:17:34,155 --> 00:17:38,526
Well, there you have it. Thank you
very much. Do come back again.

260
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:45,636
There's another chore l need you
to do for me, Lawrence.

261
00:17:46,173 --> 00:17:51,773
You'll need a large truck. Be at the
Portland docks tonight, 7:00 sharp.

262
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:54,746
-okay.
-There are a dozen crates to be picked up.

263
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,650
All save one are to be
brought here to the shop.

264
00:17:57,823 --> 00:18:02,125
The largest contains
an extremely valuable sideboard...

265
00:18:02,297 --> 00:18:03,924
...a Hepplewhite.

266
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:06,592
That is to be taken to my house.

267
00:18:06,771 --> 00:18:09,832
The movers will recognize it by its size.

268
00:18:10,242 --> 00:18:11,301
Yes, sir.

269
00:18:12,111 --> 00:18:15,913
They can leave it in the foyer.
The front door will be open.

270
00:18:16,751 --> 00:18:18,219
Got it.

271
00:18:21,324 --> 00:18:24,454
When do we meet your partner,
Mr. Barlow?

272
00:18:27,534 --> 00:18:29,162
ln his own good time.

273
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:32,937
This is fancy. ls it valuable?

274
00:18:33,109 --> 00:18:36,740
lt's an 1 8th-century harmony pin.

275
00:18:37,348 --> 00:18:40,216
Belonged to a whoremaster's mistress.

276
00:18:40,586 --> 00:18:42,316
Take it, Lawrence.

277
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:43,821
Take it...

278
00:18:43,991 --> 00:18:46,358
...for services rendered.

279
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:52,737
Back it up there, Floyd.

280
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:55,437
Yeah.

281
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:07,422
What are you doing?

282
00:19:09,863 --> 00:19:11,161
Give it here.

283
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:13,162
Give me that.

284
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,407
Get off my property.

285
00:19:20,712 --> 00:19:22,374
He didn't mean anything by it.

286
00:19:22,681 --> 00:19:24,912
l know what he meant.
Get him out of here.

287
00:19:31,661 --> 00:19:33,027
Larry, Dud's harmless.

288
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:35,893
<i>I'll put him on another route.</i>
<i>He's like a brother.</i>

289
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:39,527
What if l find another trash service
and landscaper, huh?

290
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:42,939
-How about l pull all my accounts, Mike?
-<i>Don't say that.</i>

291
00:19:43,112 --> 00:19:47,015
-l'm more than saying.
-Maybe you should talk to your daughter.

292
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:51,852
one more crack like that and you're both
through. <i>Finito.</i> Do you understand?

293
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:55,086
-ls that yours?
-l threw it out. lt's too small.

294
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:59,564
-You can't encourage that retard.
-Like l would. He's disgusting.

295
00:20:00,203 --> 00:20:04,198
l've got 1 2 crates arriving at the Portland
docks tonight l need picked up.

296
00:20:04,743 --> 00:20:06,267
Antiques.

297
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:08,972
-Stay out of there.
-l need money.

298
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,054
-Do you wanna make some money or not?
-Look, l'll help with the crates.

299
00:20:13,222 --> 00:20:15,191
-Call me later.
-Finders keepers.

300
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,386
How does it look, Daddy?
ls it too trashy?

301
00:21:25,962 --> 00:21:30,367
-What?
-Nothing. l was just thinking.

302
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:33,062
So, what were you saying
about expression?

303
00:21:33,873 --> 00:21:36,776
Graffiti is a condemnation of architecture.

304
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:42,442
Kids create on top of buildings because
they don't see the expression within.

305
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:44,679
What is the expression of a building?

306
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:49,925
lts soul, its ambiance,
a byproduct of design.

307
00:21:50,098 --> 00:21:51,930
or events within.

308
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:54,599
Back to the Marsten house?

309
00:21:54,804 --> 00:21:56,067
Sorry.

310
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,833
We can talk about your work.

311
00:21:58,009 --> 00:21:59,875
We can talk about the dog.

312
00:22:00,713 --> 00:22:02,341
l'm glad you called.

313
00:22:06,822 --> 00:22:09,121
Get off the stage, boy.

314
00:22:10,995 --> 00:22:13,430
Ben, found an old friend of yours.

315
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:17,233
-Ben Mears, welcome back.
-Hey.

316
00:22:17,404 --> 00:22:19,498
-Hello, Susan.
-Mr. Burke.

317
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:22,337
l don't expect you remember
your 8th-grade teacher.

318
00:22:22,512 --> 00:22:26,245
oh, no, l do. He was the tough guy
who taught for three reasons.

319
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,785
June, July and August. Right.
l was being facetious, Ben.

320
00:22:29,956 --> 00:22:31,982
l teach high-school English now.

321
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:35,387
Can you find time
to share your success with my class?

322
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,362
lt's more of a working vacation.

323
00:22:37,534 --> 00:22:39,093
-You sure?
-Yeah.

324
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:40,499
l'm disappointed.

325
00:22:40,672 --> 00:22:43,233
We can talk all night.
The kids want celebrities.

326
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:45,935
When was the last time
you saw a kid read a book?

327
00:22:46,113 --> 00:22:48,275
All l see are headphones
and cell phones.

328
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:51,180
You're right, Weasel.
Literature's become elitist.

329
00:22:51,354 --> 00:22:53,880
lt's like black-and-white photography.

330
00:22:54,659 --> 00:22:58,529
You know, Ben, l half expected
that cynicism from you.

331
00:22:59,032 --> 00:23:01,831
-lt's there between the lines.
-l like Ben's work.

332
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:04,529
-Come on, we're just drinking here.
-lt's okay.

333
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:07,438
Are you one of the few in town
who read the book?

334
00:23:07,611 --> 00:23:09,477
or did you just skim the reviews?

335
00:23:09,647 --> 00:23:12,880
l read <i>Damage Control</i>
and <i>Marching in Heels.</i>

336
00:23:13,053 --> 00:23:14,213
Well, don't hold back.

337
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:17,548
The world acknowledges
your talent as a writer.

338
00:23:17,726 --> 00:23:21,596
l might argue your work is antagonistic
when it needn't be...

339
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:28,196
...emotionally detached
and lacking a moral center.

340
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:33,112
lf that's the way you speak
with your English class...

341
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:35,114
...l would be honored to visit.

342
00:23:48,704 --> 00:23:50,229
Champ!

343
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,098
Come on, boy!

344
00:23:53,579 --> 00:23:55,069
Champ!

345
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,014
l'll be lookout.

346
00:24:23,756 --> 00:24:25,691
Panties a little tight?

347
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:54,231
All right.

348
00:25:07,286 --> 00:25:10,382
-He's coming.
-Get out. Get out. Get out. Go. Go. Go.

349
00:25:19,738 --> 00:25:21,366
-Catch you tomorrow.
-All right.

350
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,008
Champ!

351
00:25:24,111 --> 00:25:25,511
Champ!

352
00:25:29,485 --> 00:25:30,714
What'd you see?

353
00:25:30,888 --> 00:25:35,190
Dead soldiers. Their eyes are poked out.
Their ears are missing.

354
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:37,762
A soldier feeding pizza
to a lady's head!

355
00:25:37,931 --> 00:25:39,797
You're a douche bag, Ralphie.

356
00:25:39,967 --> 00:25:41,799
Wait!

357
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:45,172
-Where are we?
-lt looks like--

358
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,843
Mark?

359
00:25:49,015 --> 00:25:50,482
lt has to be Mark.

360
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:52,818
Mark?

361
00:26:19,593 --> 00:26:22,620
Wait. l can't breathe.

362
00:26:36,217 --> 00:26:37,445
Danny!

363
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:40,016
No, no!

364
00:26:43,561 --> 00:26:45,553
Danny! Danny!

365
00:26:50,704 --> 00:26:51,933
No!

366
00:28:11,156 --> 00:28:12,784
l think Susie wants out.

367
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:17,796
She's always e-mailing other guys,
old teachers, old boyfriends.

368
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:19,400
Well, how do you know?

369
00:28:19,568 --> 00:28:22,037
l set up a computer for her
and her mother.

370
00:28:22,205 --> 00:28:25,198
-So of course l got the passwords.
-Floyd.

371
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:27,169
Floyd.

372
00:28:27,346 --> 00:28:30,715
-You set up my computer.
-Relax. l don't know your business.

373
00:28:30,885 --> 00:28:34,152
l don't want to. What?
You have nothing to worry about.

374
00:28:34,324 --> 00:28:38,729
-Nothing's wrong with surfing The Barnyard.
-You son of a bitch!

375
00:28:40,098 --> 00:28:43,467
Yeah, l bet you felt real sorry
for that dog.

376
00:28:43,637 --> 00:28:45,196
l can't believe you!

377
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,110
You could get that.

378
00:28:52,516 --> 00:28:54,246
-Hello.
-<i>Mrs. Petrie.</i>

379
00:28:54,419 --> 00:28:57,618
Hi, l'm Marjorie Glick. We've never met.

380
00:28:57,791 --> 00:29:02,162
Look, are my boys still at your house?
lf so, could you send them home, please?

381
00:29:02,331 --> 00:29:06,497
one second, Marjorie. lt's Mrs. Glick.
She thinks her boys are here.

382
00:29:06,671 --> 00:29:09,300
-They went home.
-Mark says they went home.

383
00:29:09,475 --> 00:29:12,776
-They must be on the way.
-Does he know what time they left?

384
00:29:13,214 --> 00:29:16,743
-l didn't see anybody.
-We were outside. They left at, like, 8.

385
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,548
Mark says the boys left
around 8, Marjorie.

386
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:25,087
-okay. Great. lt's getting late.
-<i>It is.</i>

387
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:27,325
-Would you like to speak with Mark?
-No.

388
00:29:27,502 --> 00:29:30,165
No. No, l guess not. Thank you.

389
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:33,002
-We'll have to meet some time.
-That would be nice.

390
00:29:34,645 --> 00:29:36,204
Not in this life.

391
00:29:39,952 --> 00:29:41,944
-Danny?
-l found him lying in the road.

392
00:29:42,122 --> 00:29:43,488
My God, is he all right?

393
00:29:43,658 --> 00:29:45,684
-Where's Ralphie?
-Call an ambulance.

394
00:30:12,066 --> 00:30:13,796
Hubie?

395
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,540
Birdie?

396
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:23,379
lt's Floyd.

397
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:30,790
Forgot to pay your electric.

398
00:30:30,961 --> 00:30:34,455
Hey, you gonna give us a hand here,
Hubie Jr.?

399
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:42,503
Crockett's paying us 1 00 bucks
to deliver this crate.

400
00:30:42,678 --> 00:30:44,772
lf l said to you, Mike...

401
00:30:44,948 --> 00:30:46,917
...l'll pay you 200 bucks...

402
00:30:47,085 --> 00:30:51,854
...to come into the Marsten house
alone at night...

403
00:30:53,194 --> 00:30:55,527
-...would you do it?
-Hell, no.

404
00:30:56,298 --> 00:30:57,732
Me neither.

405
00:30:57,901 --> 00:31:00,132
l find that humorous.

406
00:31:08,082 --> 00:31:10,347
This place used to keep me up at night.

407
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:16,153
As a kid, l could see it
from my bedroom window.

408
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:19,987
l wouldn't be able to sleep
unless my mother pulled the shade.

409
00:31:20,868 --> 00:31:22,631
Where are you going?

410
00:31:23,071 --> 00:31:25,370
l wanna see Hubie's bedroom.

411
00:31:27,009 --> 00:31:29,274
And the bathroom where Birdie....

412
00:31:34,087 --> 00:31:35,554
Straker?

413
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,671
Let's get out of here.

414
00:31:53,816 --> 00:31:56,752
You better get back in there.
Birdie needs a boyfriend.

415
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:00,517
-You heard footsteps. We both did, right?
-l heard squealing.

416
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:02,058
l think that was you.

417
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:07,330
Hey, Mike, what do these Beemers run?

418
00:32:09,138 --> 00:32:10,731
Hurry up.

419
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:33,067
l told you it was Straker.

420
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,692
Just spread out.

421
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:55,600
<i>No sign of the Glick boy.</i>

422
00:32:57,409 --> 00:32:59,537
--find evidence of the boy.

423
00:33:09,793 --> 00:33:13,697
Mark, what were you boys doing
on this side of town?

424
00:33:14,266 --> 00:33:17,499
We were just playing flashlight tag.

425
00:33:18,072 --> 00:33:21,669
Charlie Rhodes lives just over the hill.
Did you hear about his dog?

426
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:23,875
Yeah, l heard it died.

427
00:33:24,048 --> 00:33:28,714
Mrs. Glick says you and her boys had some
trouble with Charlie on the school bus.

428
00:33:28,888 --> 00:33:32,382
You got him angry.
Did you see Charlie last night?

429
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,926
No.

430
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,632
Shut up, Cujo! Quiet!

431
00:33:43,943 --> 00:33:45,002
Hi.

432
00:33:45,913 --> 00:33:48,577
Mr. Mears. Surprised to see you
this morning.

433
00:33:48,751 --> 00:33:50,879
A child won't last long in this cold.

434
00:33:51,054 --> 00:33:55,083
These Norton girls are angels, Ben.
Before them it was Eva Prunier.

435
00:33:55,261 --> 00:33:58,959
You may not see it, but our landlady
was the prettiest in the county.

436
00:33:59,132 --> 00:34:01,398
Eva's still pretty. l can see it.

437
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:03,596
What l see in Eva, it's magic.

438
00:34:03,773 --> 00:34:07,574
Careful, Ed. Mr. Mears will turn
your heartbreak into a bestseller.

439
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,270
our secrets are safe.

440
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,882
Ben's working on a piece
of historical fiction.

441
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:13,417
Yeah, l heard.

442
00:34:13,587 --> 00:34:15,749
-Marsten house?
-Who told you that?

443
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:17,415
Little bird in the library.

444
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:21,061
What was it like in the house?
Tell us about when you found her.

445
00:34:21,232 --> 00:34:23,292
You'll have to wait for the book.

446
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:25,403
Come on. Give us a preview.

447
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:31,204
l was 9 years old, living out on Burns Road
with my aunt, Cynthia.

448
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:34,043
l went in on a dare
from the Bloody Pirates.

449
00:34:34,218 --> 00:34:37,677
Was Hubie already hanging,
or did you see him do it?

450
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,089
l saw.

451
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:46,993
l spent the whole night in there until
a friend finally got my Aunt Cynthia.

452
00:34:47,537 --> 00:34:51,339
Terrible place, looking down
on this town like a dark idol.

453
00:34:51,509 --> 00:34:54,969
-There's a quote for the liner jacket.
-We need some more water.

454
00:34:55,148 --> 00:34:56,547
Yeah, l'll help.

455
00:34:56,717 --> 00:34:59,084
What about Ronnie Barnes?

456
00:35:02,959 --> 00:35:04,188
Did you see him too?

457
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,629
No.

458
00:35:18,215 --> 00:35:20,150
No, l never did.

459
00:35:27,763 --> 00:35:29,060
l'm so embarrassed.

460
00:35:29,232 --> 00:35:32,293
l know you didn't want people
to know what you're writing.

461
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:36,373
l went to the library. l mentioned
your name to Loretta Starcher.

462
00:35:36,542 --> 00:35:39,171
Now the whole town knows.
l was trying to help.

463
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:42,112
-lt's okay.
-l was researching the Marsten's for you.

464
00:35:42,284 --> 00:35:44,115
l wanted it to be a nice surprise.

465
00:35:44,287 --> 00:35:46,381
-Are you mad? l would be.
-Ben Mears.

466
00:35:46,557 --> 00:35:49,220
Didn't mean to interrupt.
May l speak with you?

467
00:35:49,861 --> 00:35:51,159
l'll call you.

468
00:35:51,331 --> 00:35:53,823
l know you're on to something
with this book.

469
00:35:56,371 --> 00:36:00,275
-Never thought we'd see you again.
-lt's nice to see you too, chief.

470
00:36:01,178 --> 00:36:03,113
So give me an alibi.

471
00:36:03,281 --> 00:36:05,375
l was having drinks
with Susan till 9.

472
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:09,287
Matt Burke says you left Dell's at 8
because you wanted to work.

473
00:36:09,757 --> 00:36:11,157
lt might have been 8.

474
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,020
Did you see any children
on your drive?

475
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:16,394
-Any flashlights in the woods?
-No.

476
00:36:16,568 --> 00:36:19,561
Anything unusual? Maybe a van parked
alongside the road?

477
00:36:19,739 --> 00:36:21,071
No.

478
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:24,442
All right. l do appreciate your help today.

479
00:36:24,913 --> 00:36:28,680
That dog in the cemetery,
who found it first?

480
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:30,815
l did.

481
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:32,486
okay.

482
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,263
Floyd, everything work out
last night?

483
00:36:41,837 --> 00:36:43,806
He paid me, Larry.
Thanks for the job.

484
00:36:43,974 --> 00:36:46,570
Pocket money. Keep your lady happy.

485
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:48,407
Well, what can l do you for?

486
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,412
You heard about the missing kid?

487
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:52,347
A parent's worst fear.

488
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,324
Well, while we were up at the
Marsten house making that delivery...

489
00:36:57,494 --> 00:36:59,929
...l looked in the back
of the new owner's car.

490
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:03,261
l saw a plastic bag in the back seat.

491
00:37:03,837 --> 00:37:05,270
lt was leaking.

492
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:09,367
Was it little-boy-sized?

493
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,942
lt was head-sized.

494
00:37:13,884 --> 00:37:16,286
The new owner is Richard Straker.

495
00:37:16,456 --> 00:37:19,915
You think he killed the missing
Glick boy and kept the head?

496
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:21,357
l'm not saying all that.

497
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,794
What will that do
to his antique business?

498
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:28,501
-lt was leaking all over the leather seats.
-Did you tell Mike what you saw?

499
00:37:28,673 --> 00:37:31,974
No. l didn't think much of it
at the time, until today.

500
00:37:34,014 --> 00:37:37,816
So why tell me? Go tell Parkins Gillespie,
if you think it's important.

501
00:37:37,987 --> 00:37:39,979
l'm telling you because you know him.

502
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,385
Relax, Floyd.

503
00:37:41,558 --> 00:37:46,828
Straker called me this morning,
excited about tackle and shacks.

504
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,597
Seems he tried his hand at ice fishing
and finds it relaxing.

505
00:37:51,206 --> 00:37:52,674
lce fishing.

506
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:58,609
Maybe he bagged a tuna or cod, whatever
you swamp Yankees pull out of these lakes.

507
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,280
lce fishing.

508
00:38:02,089 --> 00:38:03,853
Well, that's a relief.

509
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:08,023
l was driving myself crazy.

510
00:38:08,198 --> 00:38:09,791
l understand...

511
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:12,698
...but we have to be careful, Floyd.

512
00:38:12,871 --> 00:38:15,807
Loose talk can ruin people.

513
00:38:15,975 --> 00:38:20,311
My first suspect was the other new
guy in town. Some hotshot writer.

514
00:38:20,483 --> 00:38:22,542
-What writer?
-Mears.

515
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:26,247
Nice enough, but a city guy.
A bit abrasive. You know him?

516
00:38:27,693 --> 00:38:29,685
Ben Mears.

517
00:38:31,732 --> 00:38:33,360
l know of him.

518
00:38:34,303 --> 00:38:35,669
l better get back to work.

519
00:38:35,838 --> 00:38:37,898
Hey, thanks for last night.

520
00:38:38,075 --> 00:38:40,636
And thanks for coming to me first on this.

521
00:38:40,812 --> 00:38:42,440
Bishop's Lake.

522
00:38:43,616 --> 00:38:45,778
That's the best spot for ice fishing.

523
00:38:46,888 --> 00:38:48,686
l'll tell Straker.

524
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:51,258
You're on my short list, buddy.

525
00:39:23,141 --> 00:39:24,369
Dud.

526
00:39:24,944 --> 00:39:27,243
l'm sorry, Dud.
l can't use you today.

527
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:29,882
What? Why not?

528
00:39:30,985 --> 00:39:34,923
Ruth Crockett. You shouldn't have been
messing with her, Dud.

529
00:39:35,091 --> 00:39:38,119
Now Larry's threatened to pull
all the accounts.

530
00:39:38,297 --> 00:39:42,702
Well, l can't put you on the truck, Dud.
l can't afford it.

531
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:47,665
But we're friends, Mike.
We're best friends.

532
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,334
l know. l know.

533
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,243
We still are.

534
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,884
What will l do?

535
00:39:56,589 --> 00:39:58,114
l don't know.

536
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:01,725
You know, l'll help you find another job.

537
00:40:02,432 --> 00:40:04,628
Until then, look, just take this...

538
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,999
...to hold you over, all right.

539
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:12,504
lt's not your fault, Dud.

540
00:40:13,281 --> 00:40:16,946
Whatever you did,
it was just, you know, misunderstood.

541
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:18,819
l'm sorry.

542
00:40:23,429 --> 00:40:25,261
Danny, can you hear me?

543
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:27,763
Danny? Can you hear me?

544
00:40:27,936 --> 00:40:30,235
lf you can hear me, blink your eyes.

545
00:40:34,312 --> 00:40:36,110
He's in acute mental shock.

546
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:39,247
Maybe from excessive fear, grief...

547
00:40:39,754 --> 00:40:42,349
...or some sort of emotional trauma.

548
00:40:43,125 --> 00:40:44,354
Excuse me.

549
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,321
He's getting worse.

550
00:40:50,870 --> 00:40:52,167
Marjorie.

551
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,140
l believe this is Danny's.

552
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:07,019
-Yes, doctor.
-Doctor.

553
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:12,056
Sometimes the power of prayer
and local facilities have limits.

554
00:41:12,234 --> 00:41:15,671
lt's shock, Father.
Your car didn't hit him.

555
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,632
He'll snap out of it.

556
00:41:26,655 --> 00:41:28,021
Stop it.

557
00:41:33,299 --> 00:41:35,461
Hi. How's little Roy today?

558
00:41:35,635 --> 00:41:38,696
He's fine, Jimmy. See for yourself.

559
00:41:43,012 --> 00:41:46,245
Hello. Hi. How you doing?

560
00:41:46,418 --> 00:41:48,887
l really appreciate your help, Jimmy.

561
00:41:49,055 --> 00:41:52,686
Maybe after you finish with Roy,
l could buy you lunch.

562
00:41:52,861 --> 00:41:56,593
You know, l usually have my lunch
in the cafeteria, Sandy.

563
00:41:56,766 --> 00:41:58,859
Well, little Roy and l could join you.

564
00:41:59,637 --> 00:42:01,538
That wouldn't be a good idea.

565
00:42:02,941 --> 00:42:06,640
-What would your husband say?
-''order a salad. Your ass is fat.''

566
00:42:09,217 --> 00:42:10,378
That was a joke.

567
00:42:11,454 --> 00:42:14,755
Most doctors love kids.
They have pictures all over the office.

568
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,361
lt helps the patient relax.

569
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:21,730
They figure, ''This doctor's so busy
thinking about his kids...

570
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:24,372
...he's not thinking about my naked body.''

571
00:42:25,475 --> 00:42:29,311
Yeah, well, l love kids, you know.
They're great to work with.

572
00:42:29,481 --> 00:42:31,882
They have this, you know...

573
00:42:32,051 --> 00:42:35,249
...way to thank you with their eyes.

574
00:42:35,423 --> 00:42:39,087
Yeah, but you love your toys too.
l mean, look at this car.

575
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:40,627
-Still a player.
-Player?

576
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:44,257
-You think this car's too dope for Doctor C.?
-Maybe.

577
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:54,443
l only said ''player'' because l know
how you were at Dell's.

578
00:42:54,618 --> 00:42:58,419
-l danced with you, remember?
-oh, yeah. l remember.

579
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:02,589
Would you pull over?
l have to check on little Roy.

580
00:43:02,762 --> 00:43:04,094
Sure.

581
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,660
l can't.

582
00:43:31,905 --> 00:43:33,965
You're still a nice guy.

583
00:43:34,142 --> 00:43:35,735
You are.

584
00:43:36,545 --> 00:43:39,379
lf l could have chose everything
in my life...

585
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,078
...l'd have chose a man like you.

586
00:44:42,909 --> 00:44:46,642
The more interesting items
are in the store.

587
00:44:46,815 --> 00:44:49,785
l'm sorry. l was looking
for a local boy who's missing.

588
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:52,115
l don't think you'll find him here.

589
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:54,153
No.

590
00:44:56,362 --> 00:44:59,128
l'm Ben Mears, Mr. Straker.
Been anxious to meet you.

591
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,699
Richard.

592
00:45:00,870 --> 00:45:03,999
You and your partner took the house
l was interested in.

593
00:45:04,608 --> 00:45:06,201
You comfortable up there?

594
00:45:07,211 --> 00:45:11,206
Well, it's a handful, Ben.

595
00:45:14,022 --> 00:45:16,218
l hope you find the little boy.

596
00:45:16,392 --> 00:45:20,228
Somehow, l don't think we will.
Not alive, anyway.

597
00:45:20,398 --> 00:45:21,865
How's your alibi?

598
00:45:23,602 --> 00:45:25,195
Excuse me?

599
00:45:26,039 --> 00:45:29,442
The police spoke with me today.
We're both new in town.

600
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:34,209
We're not even new. ln a small town
like this, we're strangers the first 20 years.

601
00:45:34,852 --> 00:45:37,516
Well, l happen to like it here, Ben.

602
00:45:38,291 --> 00:45:39,782
And your partner?

603
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,484
-Mr. Barlow?
-You a reporter?

604
00:45:41,663 --> 00:45:43,130
Writer.

605
00:45:43,298 --> 00:45:46,167
-Critics call me ''typist.''
-''Typist''?

606
00:45:47,037 --> 00:45:48,335
Typist.

607
00:45:49,273 --> 00:45:51,902
Well, if you're curious about the house...

608
00:45:52,077 --> 00:45:54,273
...come up and have
a drink one night.

609
00:45:55,082 --> 00:45:56,914
The truth is the place scares me.

610
00:45:57,085 --> 00:46:01,080
Well, then you never intended to take it,
did you, Mr. Typist?

611
00:46:11,607 --> 00:46:13,302
-lt's Romeo.
-More like Hannibal.

612
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:14,704
Ruth!

613
00:46:17,248 --> 00:46:19,444
-Can l talk to you?
-Send him for pizza.

614
00:46:19,618 --> 00:46:22,087
-Hey, go wash my car!
-Shut up.

615
00:46:23,924 --> 00:46:26,325
l got fired, Ruth.

616
00:46:26,896 --> 00:46:30,094
Mike said l shouldn't have
been messing with you.

617
00:46:31,736 --> 00:46:36,471
l was thinking maybe you could talk
to your father so l can get my job back.

618
00:46:36,643 --> 00:46:40,308
lt wouldn't do any good.
He's mega-protective.

619
00:46:40,482 --> 00:46:43,509
-l hate my father more than you do.
-Really?

620
00:46:43,687 --> 00:46:47,385
Well, l still like you, Ruth.
l really do.

621
00:46:48,594 --> 00:46:50,563
You seem like a nice person, Dud.

622
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:53,791
But that stuff at my house
was just to make my father mad.

623
00:46:53,968 --> 00:46:57,531
-But, Ruth--
-l'm sorry, Dud, but you gotta get real.

624
00:47:06,586 --> 00:47:08,145
Get out of here, gimp!

625
00:47:13,764 --> 00:47:16,290
You're not my best friend, Mike.

626
00:47:21,875 --> 00:47:23,673
Not anymore.

627
00:47:28,285 --> 00:47:30,049
Dump's closed, mister.

628
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:33,855
l'm just watching the fires.

629
00:47:39,836 --> 00:47:41,360
lt scares the animals away.

630
00:47:41,872 --> 00:47:43,430
Just the rats.

631
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:45,132
Smokes them from their holes.

632
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:48,407
Yeah. Where will they go?

633
00:47:49,149 --> 00:47:52,314
l guess they'll find another hole.

634
00:47:52,488 --> 00:47:53,819
You from around here?

635
00:47:55,058 --> 00:47:57,459
Yeah, just over the hill.

636
00:47:58,496 --> 00:48:02,264
-What are you writing there?
-Nothing.

637
00:48:03,871 --> 00:48:05,339
l lost my job.

638
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:08,909
Mike was my best friend
since junior high.

639
00:48:09,078 --> 00:48:10,478
lt's his backhoe.

640
00:48:10,647 --> 00:48:13,208
-l'll wash it off.
-No, leave it.

641
00:48:15,054 --> 00:48:17,683
l didn't do anything wrong.

642
00:48:17,858 --> 00:48:21,124
l was just talking with Ruth Crockett,
my girlfriend...

643
00:48:21,296 --> 00:48:23,265
...and her father got crazy...

644
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:27,030
...and told Mike he had to fire me
or he'd lose all his work.

645
00:48:27,205 --> 00:48:29,265
Yeah, that's too bad.

646
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:34,738
Say, aren't you one of the fellas
that bought the Marsten place?

647
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:39,515
-Very good.
-Are there any ghosts in that old house?

648
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:40,987
Ghosts?

649
00:48:42,494 --> 00:48:43,928
No.

650
00:48:44,097 --> 00:48:46,328
-No ghosts.
-l didn't think so.

651
00:48:47,836 --> 00:48:49,428
Well, anyway...

652
00:48:49,604 --> 00:48:53,940
...it's always nice when someone comes
down to, you know, shoot the breeze...

653
00:48:54,144 --> 00:48:57,775
...but the dump closes at 6
and it's half past 9 now, so....

654
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:59,179
Dud...

655
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:01,415
...l noticed your limping.

656
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:04,153
Curvature of the spine?

657
00:49:05,194 --> 00:49:07,163
-Does that bother you?
-Nope.

658
00:49:07,331 --> 00:49:08,593
l can work fine.

659
00:49:09,434 --> 00:49:11,767
l meant in other ways.

660
00:49:12,938 --> 00:49:14,497
No.

661
00:49:16,377 --> 00:49:17,639
Well...

662
00:49:19,181 --> 00:49:20,547
...girls.

663
00:49:21,117 --> 00:49:22,847
Just girls.

664
00:49:24,656 --> 00:49:27,455
Their boyfriends, the other kids?

665
00:49:27,627 --> 00:49:30,860
Sometimes they laugh.

666
00:49:31,032 --> 00:49:35,095
What were you to say
if l gave you a chance...

667
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,605
...to be equal to those boys and girls?

668
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:41,740
or maybe even a little more.
Would you take it?

669
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:44,879
Equal?

670
00:49:57,604 --> 00:49:59,470
<i>Danny.</i>

671
00:50:00,174 --> 00:50:01,938
<i>Danny.</i>

672
00:50:03,313 --> 00:50:04,541
Danny.

673
00:50:04,714 --> 00:50:05,807
Danny.

674
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:08,645
Danny.

675
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:10,345
Danny?

676
00:50:10,523 --> 00:50:13,084
Come on, Danny, it's me...

677
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,819
...your brother, Ralphie.

678
00:50:15,296 --> 00:50:16,889
Remember?

679
00:50:17,066 --> 00:50:18,796
You left me in the woods.

680
00:50:18,969 --> 00:50:20,904
Ralphie?

681
00:50:25,645 --> 00:50:29,845
-l'm just messing with you, Danny.
-Go away.

682
00:50:30,352 --> 00:50:33,551
Danny, l'm not mad.

683
00:50:33,724 --> 00:50:35,022
Danny.

684
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:36,592
l knew you were scared.

685
00:50:36,761 --> 00:50:39,197
Cripes, l was scared too.

686
00:50:45,207 --> 00:50:46,903
But not anymore.

687
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,210
Danny...

688
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:52,146
...l'm messing with you, Danny.

689
00:50:56,357 --> 00:50:58,188
l ain't scared at all.

690
00:51:00,029 --> 00:51:01,292
Let me in, Danny.

691
00:51:01,464 --> 00:51:03,695
Don't let Mom and Dad blame you.

692
00:51:03,868 --> 00:51:06,201
Let me in, Danny.

693
00:51:08,174 --> 00:51:09,472
All right.

694
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:15,178
You went to lunch
with Sandy McDougall?

695
00:51:15,351 --> 00:51:17,320
-What's wrong with that?
-oh, nothing.

696
00:51:17,487 --> 00:51:22,450
She's 1 9, married, barely educated.
What else is right?

697
00:51:22,629 --> 00:51:24,530
What's going on here?

698
00:51:41,122 --> 00:51:44,651
Now, who remembers the Morris chair?

699
00:51:44,828 --> 00:51:46,057
This.

700
00:51:46,230 --> 00:51:49,064
Such an excellent example.

701
00:51:49,234 --> 00:51:51,499
Very popular in Berkeley.

702
00:51:51,671 --> 00:51:54,141
Look at that leather.

703
00:51:54,309 --> 00:51:57,802
Please be kind enough
to tell your friends we're open...

704
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:01,247
...and that our prices
are so very reasonable.

705
00:52:04,456 --> 00:52:06,322
Madam...

706
00:52:06,493 --> 00:52:09,760
...this drop-leaf table would look beautiful
in a foyer...

707
00:52:10,365 --> 00:52:12,834
...or in a servants' entrance.

708
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:16,064
l am the only servant in my house.

709
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:19,268
And l am Richard Straker.

710
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:24,250
Eva Prunier. l own
a boarding house on Clift Street.

711
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:26,685
Eva Prunier.

712
00:52:26,856 --> 00:52:29,121
Your name is familiar.

713
00:52:29,627 --> 00:52:31,425
And your accent.

714
00:52:38,673 --> 00:52:39,868
Excuse me?

715
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:45,309
Tell me, Eva...

716
00:52:45,483 --> 00:52:49,114
...of all the old parlor games,
which one do you miss the most?

717
00:52:49,289 --> 00:52:53,853
As you may share a little morphine
<i>avec</i> his little friend.

718
00:52:56,633 --> 00:52:58,397
l am jealous.

719
00:52:58,570 --> 00:53:02,668
You must have been so young
at that time then.

720
00:53:02,843 --> 00:53:06,906
All you little village girls,
what, 1 6 years old? Fifteen?

721
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:09,343
Did you give to Hubie...

722
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,613
...what l think you gave to him?

723
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:13,388
oh, l knew it.

724
00:53:13,558 --> 00:53:17,792
-And did you wear his goat's-head mask?
-Stop it!

725
00:53:22,204 --> 00:53:25,003
l taught Ben Mears in the eighth grade.
He survived.

726
00:53:27,044 --> 00:53:30,846
Since then, he's had a distinguished
literary career.

727
00:53:31,017 --> 00:53:34,044
ln 2001 , he was captured
by Taliban troops...

728
00:53:34,221 --> 00:53:36,417
...while reporting the Afghan war.

729
00:53:36,591 --> 00:53:39,960
He was rescued from certain death
by U.S. Marines.

730
00:53:40,297 --> 00:53:41,890
on the return trek...

731
00:53:42,066 --> 00:53:44,535
...Ben's Marines killed 1 0 Afghan villagers.

732
00:53:44,703 --> 00:53:48,471
<i>Damage Control</i> is a factual account
of the incident.

733
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:51,910
Three Marines were court-martialed
and imprisoned.

734
00:53:52,882 --> 00:53:57,321
Ben received the Pulitzer Prize. Mr. Mears
is in town researching his new book...

735
00:53:58,189 --> 00:53:59,817
...on the Marsten house.

736
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:04,528
Mr. Mears, should anyone
in their right mind trust an author?

737
00:54:05,134 --> 00:54:07,330
A good author illuminates truth.

738
00:54:08,638 --> 00:54:11,939
-Yes.
-What's the truth about this town?

739
00:54:12,578 --> 00:54:15,139
l used to think nothing happened here.

740
00:54:15,315 --> 00:54:17,877
But the truth is everything happens here.

741
00:54:18,053 --> 00:54:20,648
one has to look close in a small town.

742
00:54:20,823 --> 00:54:22,815
The beauty is in the details.

743
00:54:22,993 --> 00:54:28,525
You have all the horror of Qalai Janghi
prison right here in one battered child.

744
00:54:28,702 --> 00:54:33,141
All the beauty of Michelangelo
in the alabaster calf of one...

745
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:35,277
...shoulder-high waitress.

746
00:54:35,445 --> 00:54:38,745
The longing you feel for the boy or girl
in the next row...

747
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:42,410
...is equal to or greater than what
your favorite musician feels...

748
00:54:42,588 --> 00:54:44,557
...for his favorite supermodel.

749
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,554
Never minimize your feelings.

750
00:54:49,264 --> 00:54:50,664
or this town.

751
00:54:52,503 --> 00:54:55,996
What's the truth about the Marines
that saved you in Afghanistan?

752
00:54:59,913 --> 00:55:02,007
l'm not a waitress or shoulder-high.

753
00:55:02,517 --> 00:55:06,285
-Let me checked those Michelangelo calves.
-lt was metaphors on the fly.

754
00:55:06,456 --> 00:55:08,721
-What do you want from me?
-Proof.

755
00:55:08,893 --> 00:55:10,555
And they really liked him?

756
00:55:10,729 --> 00:55:13,096
l'll say they warmed up to him.

757
00:55:14,468 --> 00:55:17,928
The boy went from mental shock
to extreme anemia overnight.

758
00:55:18,341 --> 00:55:20,742
What our grandfathers would call
wasting away.

759
00:55:20,911 --> 00:55:22,675
That poor family. Two sons.

760
00:55:22,847 --> 00:55:24,281
Can you imagine?

761
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:30,152
The red-cell count on a 1 4-year-old boy
should run between 85 and 95 percent.

762
00:55:30,324 --> 00:55:31,622
Danny's was 45.

763
00:55:32,494 --> 00:55:35,465
-How long until people make a connection?
-Here it comes.

764
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:38,467
Come on.
Ben, the whole town's talking.

765
00:55:38,637 --> 00:55:39,969
The house.

766
00:55:40,139 --> 00:55:41,505
lt's like a curse.

767
00:55:42,843 --> 00:55:47,145
Did you know that Hubie Marsten's
trucking firm in Boston was a front?

768
00:55:47,551 --> 00:55:52,149
Hubie was questioned twice by police.
once in Boston, and once in Malden.

769
00:55:52,491 --> 00:55:55,723
The Malden thing was for the murder
of an 1 1 -year-old boy.

770
00:55:55,895 --> 00:55:58,194
Hubie and his wife moved
to the Lot in 1 958.

771
00:55:58,366 --> 00:56:01,928
Between '58 and '74,
five children disappeared.

772
00:56:02,105 --> 00:56:05,270
But we've had no missing kids
since Hubie died. Not one.

773
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:09,609
Now the house is occupied and we have
one boy missing and another one dead.

774
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,378
So the house is a beacon for evil men.

775
00:56:12,553 --> 00:56:14,181
lt attracted you.

776
00:56:14,356 --> 00:56:17,555
Ben, l'm sure what you saw there
as a boy still haunts you.

777
00:56:17,728 --> 00:56:21,028
-You think?
-lt stayed in the town's consciousness too.

778
00:56:21,199 --> 00:56:25,763
Not just because tales of nastiness do,
but l think because of location.

779
00:56:25,939 --> 00:56:27,168
lt looks down on us...

780
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:29,368
...like it's judging us.

781
00:56:29,545 --> 00:56:32,208
or it's the mirror by which
you judge yourselves.

782
00:56:33,851 --> 00:56:35,717
We have to go up there.

783
00:56:37,323 --> 00:56:39,315
lntroduce ourselves to the new squire?

784
00:56:39,493 --> 00:56:42,463
-on behalf of the town, of course.
-l've met the squire.

785
00:56:42,631 --> 00:56:45,534
-lt's research.
-Susan, stay away from there.

786
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,102
Ben, you're committed to the truth.

787
00:56:48,273 --> 00:56:50,742
Why don't you tell us
why you're really here?

788
00:56:52,179 --> 00:56:55,047
You're not writing a book
on the Marsten house. Right?

789
00:56:59,522 --> 00:57:01,957
No. No, l'm not.

790
00:57:03,228 --> 00:57:04,992
What do you mean?

791
00:57:05,798 --> 00:57:08,097
-Ben?
-The book is a non-fiction look...

792
00:57:08,268 --> 00:57:10,567
...at the roots of domestic evil.

793
00:57:11,574 --> 00:57:13,167
You're writing about us?

794
00:57:13,343 --> 00:57:17,212
-of course he is.
-You lied? To everyone?

795
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:19,748
Haunted houses are not my genre.

796
00:57:19,919 --> 00:57:24,824
So we're evil. We're a small town,
small-minded and evil?

797
00:57:24,993 --> 00:57:28,362
-l won't be a character in your stupid book.
-Hey, Susan!

798
00:57:30,468 --> 00:57:32,733
You will find evil if you want it, Ben.

799
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:38,208
Racism, greed, envy.

800
00:57:38,813 --> 00:57:40,839
But we have heroes here too.

801
00:57:41,651 --> 00:57:44,212
-l'm sure.
-lf you're gonna look at this town...

802
00:57:44,388 --> 00:57:47,518
...look fair and throw away
your preconceptions.

803
00:57:47,693 --> 00:57:52,632
l've seen the good,
and it far outweighs any bad.

804
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:59,306
We're wrapping up for the night.

805
00:58:00,077 --> 00:58:01,340
Eva?

806
00:58:02,014 --> 00:58:03,448
You all right?

807
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:06,118
No, l don't think so.

808
00:58:08,657 --> 00:58:10,455
What is it, Eva?

809
00:58:11,628 --> 00:58:13,563
That house.

810
00:58:13,731 --> 00:58:15,757
lt haunts me.

811
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:21,900
l used to sneak up there
with Eva Werts and Loretta Starcher.

812
00:58:22,077 --> 00:58:24,239
We were young, bored.

813
00:58:25,214 --> 00:58:27,775
Hubie and Birdie Marsten were alive.

814
00:58:29,054 --> 00:58:31,182
l'm ashamed of the things we did.

815
00:58:31,357 --> 00:58:33,417
You were just a kid.

816
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:38,692
l used to write letters in French
for Marsten, to a man in Marseilles.

817
00:58:38,868 --> 00:58:43,739
Marsten admired this man,
said he was beyond good and evil.

818
00:58:43,909 --> 00:58:45,810
Horrifying, sublime.

819
00:58:45,979 --> 00:58:50,543
l'm thinking about the missing boy
and his brother, Ed. l feel terrible.

820
00:58:50,719 --> 00:58:54,122
l feel as though the invitations
that l wrote...

821
00:58:54,291 --> 00:58:56,726
...are somehow being answered.

822
00:58:58,230 --> 00:59:02,031
-After 50 years?
-Well, suppose he had a partner or a son?

823
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:03,727
No, no.

824
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:07,634
Eva...

825
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,412
...you know how l feel.

826
00:59:11,583 --> 00:59:14,610
l liked your husband. l respected him.

827
00:59:15,288 --> 00:59:17,450
But l love you now.

828
00:59:18,459 --> 00:59:21,588
And these last 1 0,
1 5 years of our lives...

829
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:23,665
...they can be great together.

830
00:59:25,569 --> 00:59:29,132
This loving you from afar was killing me.

831
01:00:07,765 --> 01:00:09,290
<i>Mom?</i>

832
01:00:11,537 --> 01:00:13,369
<i>It's Danny.</i>

833
01:00:16,077 --> 01:00:18,046
<i>I found Ralphie.</i>

834
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:24,486
Go away. Stop it.

835
01:00:24,690 --> 01:00:26,556
Who is this?

836
01:00:30,866 --> 01:00:33,563
l wish you'd told me earlier
about the dog, Michael.

837
01:00:33,736 --> 01:00:35,398
l'd have postponed the funeral.

838
01:00:35,572 --> 01:00:38,098
lt was dead, Father.
lt was hanging on the fence.

839
01:00:38,276 --> 01:00:41,441
Yes, but now all this land
has got to be reconsecrated.

840
01:00:41,615 --> 01:00:45,747
Technically speaking, we're standing
on unhallowed ground.

841
01:00:51,462 --> 01:00:52,930
''Jerk.''

842
01:00:53,665 --> 01:00:56,465
lt's Dud. Should never have fired him.

843
01:00:57,004 --> 01:00:58,438
Where's he been hiding?

844
01:00:58,606 --> 01:01:02,908
When tragedy strikes in a family,
there's a safety net.

845
01:01:03,947 --> 01:01:08,751
lt's the safety net of community,
of which we are all a part.

846
01:01:08,988 --> 01:01:11,924
However, when tragedy reaches out
and touches us all....

847
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,888
Sticking to the anemia, Jim?

848
01:01:15,398 --> 01:01:18,493
The family refused an autopsy.

849
01:01:18,869 --> 01:01:21,567
lt may have been anemia. l'm not sure.

850
01:01:22,241 --> 01:01:26,236
Whatever killed Danny Glick
is being buried in that grave.

851
01:01:26,414 --> 01:01:31,183
<i>Ben Mears was in a motorcycle accident</i>
<i>three years ago. A girl was killed.</i>

852
01:01:31,354 --> 01:01:33,585
<i>Mears was cleared of all blame.</i>

853
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:37,559
<i>Kurt Barlow, antique dealer.</i>
<i>That's all they found on him.</i>

854
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,756
-That's it?
-<i>On him.</i>

855
01:01:39,933 --> 01:01:43,803
<i>Richard Thomas Straker,</i>
<i>born in Tampa, Florida.</i>

856
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:49,380
<i>E</i>x<i>pelled from UF in 1 966</i>

857
01:01:50,082 --> 01:01:54,020
<i>Charlie Rhodes is clean.</i>
<i>The big surprise is the boy's father.</i>

858
01:01:54,188 --> 01:01:59,321
<i>Tony Glick filed for bankruptcy in 1 990 and</i>
<i>left a lot of people in Nashua on the hook.</i>

859
01:01:59,495 --> 01:02:01,589
Thanks, Nolly.

860
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:04,833
-Y<i>our daughter called from Florida.</i>
-Danny!

861
01:02:05,004 --> 01:02:06,529
<i>Congratulations, boss.</i>

862
01:02:06,706 --> 01:02:10,165
-Stop this nonsense.
-<i>Aren't you young to be a grandfather?</i>

863
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:16,113
Ed...

864
01:02:16,453 --> 01:02:19,481
...l wanna pay my respects to Jack.

865
01:02:20,226 --> 01:02:22,957
l feel guilty about last night.

866
01:02:23,263 --> 01:02:26,666
l was upset and did something
l shouldn't have.

867
01:02:26,902 --> 01:02:28,871
lt's my fault.

868
01:02:29,372 --> 01:02:31,364
l'm sorry, Ed.

869
01:02:34,781 --> 01:02:37,842
-Hi, doctor.
-Hi.

870
01:02:38,018 --> 01:02:40,921
-l'll see you later, Matt.
-l can't believe it.

871
01:02:41,090 --> 01:02:44,686
-l used to babysit Danny Glick.
-Yeah. oh, how's the baby?

872
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,693
Poor little boy has a chest cold.

873
01:02:46,931 --> 01:02:50,801
l don't have the car, and Roy says doctors
don't make house calls anymore.

874
01:02:50,970 --> 01:02:53,770
-He says they're on a pedestal.
-l didn't say that.

875
01:02:53,942 --> 01:02:57,811
Well, l wouldn't say a pedestal,
but l guess l could make a house call.

876
01:03:16,508 --> 01:03:17,806
Ruth?

877
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:29,088
Ruth.

878
01:03:29,327 --> 01:03:32,264
lt's freezing in here.

879
01:03:32,866 --> 01:03:35,358
l came home from school.

880
01:03:36,036 --> 01:03:38,301
What's wrong, honey?

881
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:40,575
Are you sick?

882
01:03:47,821 --> 01:03:50,313
Why don't you let me
take that necklace off?

883
01:03:50,491 --> 01:03:51,982
No.

884
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,633
l had the strangest dream.

885
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:59,797
l was married to Dud Rogers.

886
01:03:59,972 --> 01:04:04,103
He took me flying over town,
and l saw a big fire.

887
01:04:04,712 --> 01:04:09,276
-l saw you yelling up at me.
-Dud Rogers? The cripple?

888
01:04:09,486 --> 01:04:11,853
Sounds more like a nightmare.

889
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,617
You had Dud fired.

890
01:04:14,793 --> 01:04:18,754
-That job was all he had.
-The guy is a menace.

891
01:04:21,504 --> 01:04:23,939
Can l get you something?

892
01:04:24,408 --> 01:04:26,206
No.

893
01:04:27,045 --> 01:04:28,843
You sure?

894
01:04:29,548 --> 01:04:31,540
-Nothing?
-Not that!

895
01:04:31,718 --> 01:04:34,017
Can't you see l don't feel good?

896
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:45,236
Floyd?

897
01:04:49,043 --> 01:04:51,103
You there, Floyd?

898
01:05:25,397 --> 01:05:26,922
Come on.

899
01:05:27,099 --> 01:05:32,039
Come on, we'll get you inside.
lt's too cold, too cold.

900
01:05:45,493 --> 01:05:47,962
lt's okay, it's okay.

901
01:06:06,558 --> 01:06:07,957
What?

902
01:06:11,465 --> 01:06:14,731
<i>Mike.</i>

903
01:06:16,205 --> 01:06:19,768
-<i>Mikey?</i>
-Are you staring at me?

904
01:06:22,114 --> 01:06:24,413
<i>Mikey.</i>

905
01:06:24,917 --> 01:06:27,318
Y<i>our eyes are poked out.</i>

906
01:06:29,157 --> 01:06:30,887
<i>Ears are missing.</i>

907
01:06:31,060 --> 01:06:33,154
Stop staring at me.

908
01:06:35,066 --> 01:06:36,557
Damn you.

909
01:06:36,735 --> 01:06:39,227
You will shut those eyes!

910
01:06:39,406 --> 01:06:41,534
Damn you, shut those eyes!

911
01:06:53,225 --> 01:06:57,254
l'm a working mother. l can't drive Mark
to school. l need him on that bus.

912
01:06:57,432 --> 01:06:59,128
l understand.

913
01:06:59,334 --> 01:07:02,100
l spoke with Charlie Rhodes,
and he seems to think...

914
01:07:02,273 --> 01:07:05,539
...Mark knows a lot more
about the dead dog than he's saying.

915
01:07:06,211 --> 01:07:09,512
He also thinks that Mark
may be selling pot on the bus.

916
01:07:09,683 --> 01:07:12,711
-That's bull.
-ls he crazy? My God.

917
01:07:12,888 --> 01:07:15,380
What's the problem
between you and Charlie?

918
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:19,292
What, besides the fact l don't
have a father to kick his ass?

919
01:07:20,966 --> 01:07:23,835
Maybe l can speak to the principal
at Mark's school.

920
01:07:24,004 --> 01:07:25,802
Maybe she can broker a truce.

921
01:07:26,007 --> 01:07:30,912
You know what? Don't bother. The guy's
a moo-goo-gai maniac anyway.

922
01:07:31,248 --> 01:07:32,716
What?

923
01:07:33,785 --> 01:07:36,585
You know, like, Vietnam, the....

924
01:07:36,757 --> 01:07:39,852
Charlie was there.
He shows us pictures on the bus.

925
01:07:40,027 --> 01:07:42,519
He thinks he can, like,
impress us or something.

926
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:44,998
Don't lie about this, Mark.

927
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:47,934
He keeps them locked
in his glove compartment.

928
01:07:57,052 --> 01:07:58,748
Royce!

929
01:07:58,955 --> 01:08:00,719
Royce, no!

930
01:08:01,592 --> 01:08:04,358
You're going to die.
Are you ready to die, doctor?

931
01:08:04,531 --> 01:08:07,865
ls my wife a whore?
lf not, you think you can pump her for free?

932
01:08:08,035 --> 01:08:10,197
-No, no.
-No, because she is a whore.

933
01:08:10,706 --> 01:08:14,370
-Royce, baby, please--
-Shut up, Sandy. Shut the hell up!

934
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,841
That's a $ 1 0,000 whore you just
rolled off. You understand?

935
01:08:20,086 --> 01:08:23,056
Ten thousand tomorrow,
or l pull this trigger.

936
01:08:23,224 --> 01:08:26,024
Who'd blame me?
Who'd feel sorry for a dirty doctor?

937
01:08:26,196 --> 01:08:27,630
okay! okay.

938
01:08:39,048 --> 01:08:43,749
-Shut that thing up!
-lt's okay, Roy. lt's okay.

939
01:08:44,857 --> 01:08:49,819
-Shut that thing up!
-What? Royce, no!

940
01:08:56,673 --> 01:08:58,733
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

941
01:09:02,749 --> 01:09:07,188
-Hi, guys. What can l get you?
-Hey, Susie, take a seat.

942
01:09:07,356 --> 01:09:09,018
l'm pretty busy now, Floyd.

943
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:15,192
Hi, Mike. How are you?

944
01:09:15,835 --> 01:09:20,536
-Well, l'm fine, Susan. Thanks for asking.
-So where you been, Susie?

945
01:09:21,944 --> 01:09:23,469
Working.

946
01:09:24,447 --> 01:09:27,144
Can we talk about this
another time? Soon?

947
01:09:27,351 --> 01:09:30,049
-l think we have some things to talk about.
-We do.

948
01:09:30,223 --> 01:09:33,921
oh, that was good, Floyd,
but l think we can push a bit further.

949
01:09:34,229 --> 01:09:38,361
My point being is, why doesn't anyone
here just, l don't know, say the truth?

950
01:09:39,002 --> 01:09:40,333
What's wrong with you?

951
01:09:40,505 --> 01:09:42,701
-He doesn't feel well.
-Come on, Floyd.

952
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:44,137
Tell her you're pissed.

953
01:09:44,343 --> 01:09:46,073
She got dumped by the writer...

954
01:09:46,246 --> 01:09:48,238
...and she's crawling back
to homeboy.

955
01:09:48,416 --> 01:09:50,351
-Knock it off.
-What's he saying?

956
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,786
Floyd, tell her to kiss off,
or tell her you love her.

957
01:09:53,991 --> 01:09:56,119
At least say something real.

958
01:09:57,930 --> 01:10:00,024
Look, this-- This isn't fair, Susie.

959
01:10:00,767 --> 01:10:02,531
Are you with me or with him?

960
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:05,864
-Neither.
-Who is this writer guy anyway?

961
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:09,342
Come on. He's the one
you been reading about on her e-mails.

962
01:10:09,513 --> 01:10:11,573
-l said, shut up!
-What e-mails?

963
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:15,244
-Shut up, Mike. Shut up!
-Hang on, now. You two are friends.

964
01:10:22,699 --> 01:10:25,693
-What kind of junk are you on, Mike?
-Nothing.

965
01:10:26,071 --> 01:10:29,633
l'm just sick.
Sick of all that bullshit, anyway.

966
01:10:29,810 --> 01:10:31,641
You upset about the funeral?

967
01:10:32,948 --> 01:10:35,713
l came back after everyone left.

968
01:10:36,052 --> 01:10:40,184
l waited around a long time, and that's
when l must've started to get sick.

969
01:10:40,693 --> 01:10:42,889
Everything after that is gone.

970
01:10:43,063 --> 01:10:44,895
What do you mean?

971
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:48,761
l saw my mother's eyes...

972
01:10:49,205 --> 01:10:52,801
...which is pretty weird,
because she's dead.

973
01:10:54,513 --> 01:10:57,244
My mother's eyes watching me drown.

974
01:10:59,620 --> 01:11:02,113
lt was a pretty crazy dream.

975
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:05,328
Why do you say it was a dream?

976
01:11:05,495 --> 01:11:07,589
Look at my clothes, Mr. Burke.

977
01:11:07,765 --> 01:11:11,703
-l must have fallen asleep in the dirt.
-Come on, we'll get out of here.

978
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:14,340
-You can sleep in my guest room.
-l can drive.

979
01:11:14,508 --> 01:11:17,502
Listen to your old teacher.
You're either sick or high.

980
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:21,311
So if you're not better in the morning,
l'll drive you to the clinic.

981
01:11:22,921 --> 01:11:24,184
Susan.

982
01:11:24,356 --> 01:11:26,882
Could l speak to you
for a minute, please?

983
01:11:28,062 --> 01:11:30,964
-l've said all l have to say--
-But l haven't.

984
01:11:31,835 --> 01:11:35,966
-Please.
-l think we've had enough for one evening.

985
01:11:36,141 --> 01:11:38,269
Mom, l'll be right in.

986
01:11:45,154 --> 01:11:49,786
l'm not gonna stop writing the book,
but l can change the name of the town.

987
01:11:49,961 --> 01:11:54,093
l could change the state. The town
was only meant to be a metaphor anyway.

988
01:11:54,434 --> 01:11:59,271
-Then why choose Jerusalem's Lot?
-Because this is the town l know.

989
01:11:59,574 --> 01:12:01,668
lt's a town you think you know...

990
01:12:01,879 --> 01:12:04,576
...and a town that thought it knew you.

991
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:17,792
He'll be gone in a day, Susan. You'll see.

992
01:12:17,968 --> 01:12:19,766
Now that the truth is out.

993
01:12:38,933 --> 01:12:40,526
Dud?

994
01:12:40,702 --> 01:12:41,964
Hey, Floyd.

995
01:12:42,137 --> 01:12:45,836
-Where you been, gimp?
-l don't limp anymore, Floyd.

996
01:12:46,009 --> 01:12:47,705
And why not?

997
01:12:47,879 --> 01:12:49,677
Because l'm different.

998
01:12:50,683 --> 01:12:54,519
You were always different, Dud.
Where you going?

999
01:12:54,689 --> 01:12:57,158
l'm going to see Ruth Crockett.

1000
01:12:57,527 --> 01:13:00,588
Do yourself a favor. Stay clear.

1001
01:13:00,764 --> 01:13:04,964
Clear of them all. Bitches ain't worth it.

1002
01:13:06,139 --> 01:13:09,075
l need some food, Floyd.

1003
01:13:09,344 --> 01:13:11,006
For Ruth.

1004
01:13:12,449 --> 01:13:15,385
l don't know what the hell
you're talking about, Dud.

1005
01:13:16,888 --> 01:13:21,259
lf you're pissed with anyone,
it should be Larry Crockett.

1006
01:13:21,462 --> 01:13:23,988
Mike and l always been good to you.

1007
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:26,031
Especially Mike.

1008
01:13:28,905 --> 01:13:30,498
Dud?

1009
01:13:39,087 --> 01:13:41,022
You seem a lot better now.

1010
01:13:41,424 --> 01:13:44,987
Yeah, the fresh air
must've sobered me up.

1011
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:48,297
l have a sweatshirt for you,
and sweatpants.

1012
01:13:48,467 --> 01:13:50,368
That door leads to the bathroom.

1013
01:13:50,837 --> 01:13:52,271
Thanks.

1014
01:13:59,216 --> 01:14:00,479
That...

1015
01:14:01,186 --> 01:14:03,178
...bruise looks painful.

1016
01:14:03,356 --> 01:14:06,794
oh, yeah.
You should've seen the other guy.

1017
01:14:09,098 --> 01:14:10,566
Well...

1018
01:14:10,767 --> 01:14:12,633
...you should get it taken care of.

1019
01:14:12,804 --> 01:14:15,171
-Good night, Mike.
-Good night.

1020
01:14:26,724 --> 01:14:28,022
Ralphie?

1021
01:14:28,193 --> 01:14:30,287
Ralphie, where have you been?

1022
01:14:33,033 --> 01:14:34,296
Yes.

1023
01:14:34,469 --> 01:14:38,567
Yes, of course you can come home.
Please come home, Ralphie.

1024
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:46,681
<i>Mike.</i>

1025
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:13,319
<i>Mike.</i>

1026
01:15:37,894 --> 01:15:38,884
Hello?

1027
01:15:42,034 --> 01:15:44,060
Thank you for coming.

1028
01:15:49,779 --> 01:15:51,577
l'm surprised you called me.

1029
01:15:51,748 --> 01:15:54,115
What you write
is the least of my worries.

1030
01:15:59,427 --> 01:16:00,792
Well, is he alone?

1031
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:04,056
-He is now.
-Maybe it's an intruder.

1032
01:16:04,234 --> 01:16:06,396
-Did you call the police?
-No.

1033
01:16:07,505 --> 01:16:08,768
Not yet.

1034
01:16:10,008 --> 01:16:13,377
-l want you to see the body first.
-The body?

1035
01:16:14,549 --> 01:16:18,111
-You said he was acting strange.
-He's not moving.

1036
01:16:18,387 --> 01:16:20,253
Did you go in there?

1037
01:16:20,724 --> 01:16:23,058
l peeked in, briefly.

1038
01:16:23,562 --> 01:16:24,995
Was he dead?

1039
01:16:25,164 --> 01:16:26,927
-l don't know.
-Matt.

1040
01:16:27,133 --> 01:16:30,332
What the hell is going on here?
You didn't kill him, did you?

1041
01:16:30,505 --> 01:16:33,566
No. of course not.

1042
01:16:40,353 --> 01:16:41,718
Mike?

1043
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:44,954
Mike Ryerson?

1044
01:16:48,766 --> 01:16:51,600
You see? Nothing.

1045
01:16:58,313 --> 01:17:02,081
Look at his chest. Loot at the bruise.

1046
01:17:08,261 --> 01:17:11,698
-There's no bruise.
-l saw it. lt has to be there.

1047
01:17:12,834 --> 01:17:16,271
He might be G'd out
on some designer drug.

1048
01:17:19,210 --> 01:17:22,408
Call an ambulance, the police
and a lawyer, if you have one.

1049
01:17:22,581 --> 01:17:26,519
Hang on, hang on.
Mike buried Danny Glick today.

1050
01:17:26,687 --> 01:17:29,988
There was a bruise on his chest.
l saw it!

1051
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:34,999
l heard talking in this room. l heard him
open the window. l heard laughing.

1052
01:17:35,166 --> 01:17:38,535
l should have come in,
but l was too scared.

1053
01:17:43,212 --> 01:17:46,080
Your intruder would have to be
a fireman to climb up.

1054
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:48,776
Ben, l know what l heard.

1055
01:17:49,054 --> 01:17:52,388
l wanted to tell you before
everyone starts calling me crazy.

1056
01:18:00,837 --> 01:18:02,499
okay, let's get this done.

1057
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,003
Handsome corpse. You sure he's dead?

1058
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:12,543
Atypical lividity, but he's dead all right.

1059
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:15,358
-Sorry to drag you into this.
-Don't be.

1060
01:18:15,526 --> 01:18:19,464
-l don't know why you did, though.
-lf l told you, you'd have me committed.

1061
01:18:19,632 --> 01:18:24,503
Maybe we should move down the hall a bit.
Could be some kind of contagious disease.

1062
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:29,812
ls it similar to what killed Danny Glick?
Acute anemia?

1063
01:18:30,214 --> 01:18:34,516
We'll leave that for the lab coats,
but there's no immediate sign of foul play.

1064
01:18:34,687 --> 01:18:37,088
As for that intruder you heard....

1065
01:18:37,257 --> 01:18:40,695
-You have a 1 2-foot ladder in your garage?
-No.

1066
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:46,569
You heard Mr. Ryerson's voice
and some laughter.

1067
01:18:46,739 --> 01:18:49,800
-Could it have been his laughter?
-lt sounded like a child.

1068
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:53,937
You said he slept here because
he was acting loopy and started a fight.

1069
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:58,019
-Yeah?
-Some people laugh when they're drunk.

1070
01:18:58,522 --> 01:19:01,925
They'll run some toxicology tests
on his blood.

1071
01:19:02,094 --> 01:19:04,359
How did you get involved in this,
Mr. Mears?

1072
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:06,090
Matt called me.

1073
01:19:08,370 --> 01:19:10,566
Close friends?

1074
01:19:11,775 --> 01:19:13,607
Literary men.

1075
01:19:14,246 --> 01:19:18,479
See, most people find a body,
and they call the police. You called a writer.

1076
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:23,282
<i>I should've pulled that trigger.</i>
Y<i>ou're finished, Cody.</i>

1077
01:19:23,459 --> 01:19:26,020
Banks don't open until nine, Royce.

1078
01:19:26,196 --> 01:19:29,964
-Look, l'm with a dead body here, okay--
-Y<i>ou're gonna be the dead body.</i>

1079
01:19:30,669 --> 01:19:32,535
<i>My wife came to you professionally!</i>

1080
01:19:32,705 --> 01:19:35,504
-<i>I'm calling the medical board!</i>
-Don't call the board.

1081
01:19:35,677 --> 01:19:37,144
Don't call the board.

1082
01:19:37,312 --> 01:19:40,772
That's not gonna help anybody.
l need time to shift some funds.

1083
01:19:40,951 --> 01:19:43,079
l just bought a car.

1084
01:19:43,788 --> 01:19:45,780
You'll have your 1 0 grand by tomorrow.

1085
01:19:48,830 --> 01:19:50,388
You okay?

1086
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:54,065
Pupillary contraction. Gets me every time.

1087
01:20:02,015 --> 01:20:07,250
-Were you waiting for me?
-No, sir. Run along, Mark.

1088
01:20:16,302 --> 01:20:19,273
Anything unusual?
A van parked along side the road?

1089
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:46,370
oh, Ben, l heard about Mike Ryerson.
What happened?

1090
01:20:46,547 --> 01:20:49,483
-Nobody knows.
-Ann Norton called.

1091
01:20:49,652 --> 01:20:52,213
She has some things to say
about the book.

1092
01:20:52,422 --> 01:20:57,021
-l don't have to look for a new room, do l?
-No, no. You could write a chapter on me.

1093
01:20:57,196 --> 01:20:58,857
Thanks.

1094
01:20:59,300 --> 01:21:02,702
Ed, where were you all night?

1095
01:21:02,871 --> 01:21:06,400
Blowing off steam.
Hope l worried you sick.

1096
01:21:06,576 --> 01:21:08,511
l've been thinking about us, Ed.

1097
01:21:08,680 --> 01:21:11,650
ls that right? What have you
been thinking, Miss Prunier?

1098
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:14,151
Weasel, got some beer,
if you give me a hand.

1099
01:21:14,322 --> 01:21:16,017
Breakfast of champions.

1100
01:21:32,247 --> 01:21:34,910
Parkins, l want my phone call!

1101
01:21:36,921 --> 01:21:39,288
Let me out of here!

1102
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:43,592
-Let me out of here!
-Shut up!

1103
01:21:50,173 --> 01:21:53,941
Do you think these bars will hold me,
Mears? l'll see you tonight!

1104
01:21:54,113 --> 01:21:57,778
Yeah, l'm really scared!
Why don't you bring your rubber gloves?!

1105
01:21:58,219 --> 01:22:01,087
No wonder she broke up with you!

1106
01:22:02,592 --> 01:22:05,791
lf that's what you wear to a fight,
what do you wear to bed?!

1107
01:22:15,944 --> 01:22:18,710
Who do you think
was in the room with him?

1108
01:22:21,653 --> 01:22:23,588
l have my suspicions.

1109
01:22:23,790 --> 01:22:26,055
l'm holding back, lest peop--

1110
01:22:30,132 --> 01:22:32,761
Call me crazy. There's someone upstairs.

1111
01:22:34,172 --> 01:22:35,936
You're sure?

1112
01:22:36,108 --> 01:22:38,737
l know my house.
There's someone up there.

1113
01:22:40,448 --> 01:22:41,779
You hear?

1114
01:22:43,919 --> 01:22:45,478
Call the police.

1115
01:22:45,655 --> 01:22:48,250
-Matt.
-Not yet.

1116
01:22:48,927 --> 01:22:52,295
Start talking. About anything.

1117
01:22:53,834 --> 01:22:58,034
Well, you won't get any argument from me.
l completely agree.

1118
01:23:01,879 --> 01:23:04,144
You hope he gets run out of town?

1119
01:23:09,123 --> 01:23:12,686
You're totally right. He can't be trusted.

1120
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:19,163
He did deceive you.
He deceived all of us.

1121
01:23:24,311 --> 01:23:28,249
--and then they just turn out
to be someone completely different.

1122
01:24:13,584 --> 01:24:15,485
Mr. Burke.

1123
01:24:16,622 --> 01:24:18,591
Mr. Burke.

1124
01:24:23,932 --> 01:24:25,798
Mike.

1125
01:24:37,553 --> 01:24:39,646
-What happened to you?
-Look at me.

1126
01:24:41,124 --> 01:24:44,425
Mr. Burke. Look at me.

1127
01:24:47,700 --> 01:24:50,671
-l know why you invited me here.
-Go away, Mike.

1128
01:24:50,839 --> 01:24:55,801
-l can feel the way you look at me.
-l revoke your invitation to this house.

1129
01:25:00,352 --> 01:25:05,554
Mike, in the name of God Almighty...

1130
01:25:06,194 --> 01:25:07,822
...leave.

1131
01:25:08,164 --> 01:25:12,364
Wouldn't it be a relief to touch me,
just once?

1132
01:25:14,206 --> 01:25:16,437
Then l can touch you.

1133
01:25:20,816 --> 01:25:24,686
-Look at me.
-You're dead, Mike!

1134
01:25:28,527 --> 01:25:33,399
-What happened to me?
-You died, Mike. You died.

1135
01:25:34,069 --> 01:25:35,867
You died yesterday.

1136
01:25:36,038 --> 01:25:38,837
You're a monster, a nightmare....

1137
01:25:39,009 --> 01:25:41,444
No. No, that can't be.

1138
01:25:41,612 --> 01:25:44,378
Go away, Mike. Go away.

1139
01:25:44,551 --> 01:25:47,419
No!

1140
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,762
Matt?

1141
01:25:56,936 --> 01:25:58,426
Matt!

1142
01:26:01,776 --> 01:26:04,109
No, no! No!

1143
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:08,379
-Lights out.
-Let me out of here! Let me out of here!

1144
01:26:09,688 --> 01:26:13,090
-What am l being charged with?
-Drunk and disorderly.

1145
01:26:16,131 --> 01:26:18,794
Mears.

1146
01:26:21,538 --> 01:26:23,973
oh, Mears.

1147
01:26:24,442 --> 01:26:27,242
-You wanna finish this, Mears?
-Go to sleep...

1148
01:26:27,414 --> 01:26:30,851
-...before l charge you with assault.
-You're a coward, Mears.

1149
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:34,649
You'll never be a Bloody Pirate.

1150
01:26:35,526 --> 01:26:37,426
What did you say?

1151
01:26:37,695 --> 01:26:42,031
You'll never be a Bloody Pirate.

1152
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:45,695
You'll never be a Bloody Pirate.

1153
01:26:50,246 --> 01:26:52,010
Marjorie....

1154
01:26:53,185 --> 01:26:54,710
Ralph!

1155
01:27:04,067 --> 01:27:06,628
Mark.

1156
01:27:06,904 --> 01:27:09,237
open the window.

1157
01:27:09,576 --> 01:27:13,947
Come on, Mark. open the window.
