1
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,144
My name is Michael Anderson...

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,897
I'm not what you'd call
a Rhodes Scholar

3
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:24,066
I don't have much in the way
of philosophy either...

4
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,777
but I know one thing...

5
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:30,781
In this world,
you have to pay as you go.

6
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:34,535
Sometimes, all you have.

7
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,790
That's a lesson I thought
I learned nine years ago

8
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:43,585
during what folks in these parts
call the Storm of the Century...

9
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:45,629
but I was wrong.

10
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:48,173
I only started learning
during the Big Blow.

11
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,384
I finished just last week.

12
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,318
I grew up in Maine...

13
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,737
but in a way
I never really lived in Maine...

14
00:01:12,573 --> 00:01:15,409
I think anyone from my part
of the world would say the same.

15
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:37,347
Folks from Little Tall send their taxes
to Augusta same as other folks...

16
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,267
and we got either a lobster
or a loon on our license plates

17
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:41,602
same as other folks...

18
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:43,437
We root for the University
of Maine's teams,

19
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:45,898
especially the women's
basketball team,

20
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,441
same as other folks.

21
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:55,866
- Hey, Sonny, you forgot one.
- One for the pot for good luck!

22
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,452
Better double it, Sonny,
the weatherman says it's comin' on.

23
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:01,663
Seen 'em come in every winter,
they howl in and howl out...

24
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:03,165
July always comes.

25
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:05,834
Still, they say this one's
gonna be something special.

26
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:09,755
(Mike:) But we ain't the same.
Out on the islands is different.

27
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,757
We pull together when we have to.

28
00:02:11,757 --> 00:02:14,593
- We'll get through her.
- Yeh, like always.

29
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,054
When you mind the swell,
you mind the boat.

30
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:21,767
What's a Frenchman like you know?

31
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,102
(Mike:) And we can keep a
secret when we have to...

32
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,982
we kept our share back in 1989.

33
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:33,362
And the people who
live there keep them still.

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,536
I know. I stay in touch.

35
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:18,198
I got all my canned goods now...

36
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,201
You wouldn't think there was
a big storm coming, would you?

37
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:23,245
I just pray we don't lose the power.

38
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,840
Radio says
it's gonna snow a bitch.

39
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,885
Easy, Ferd.
It's just a cap of snow.

40
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,262
Trouble don't cross the reach,
ain't that why we live here?

41
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:47,811
Yeah... Well, if we get in trouble,
we're in trouble.

42
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:14,838
(TV:) This is the storm
that's caused fifteen deaths...

43
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,049
as it crossed the
Great Plains and the Midwest...

44
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,803
Folks, here comes trouble...

45
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,098
this is a very atypical storm,
almost a winter hurricane...

46
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:28,560
the sort that paralyzed
the East Coast

47
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:31,188
and buried Boston back in 1976...

48
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:42,741
(Mike:) The first person to see
Andre Linoge was Martha Clarendon.

49
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:48,455
He was also the last
person she ever saw.

50
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,171
We haven't seen a storm
of comparable power until now.

51
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,800
Will it gives us a
break and stay out to sea?

52
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:03,053
Unfortunately the storm
track computer says no.

53
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:04,221
Oh, my!

54
00:05:21,655 --> 00:05:23,615
Look at this!

55
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:25,826
The systems
will collide over Maine...

56
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:28,829
Oh, dear!

57
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:34,585
Hurricane-force winds,
phenomenal amounts of snow...

58
00:05:34,626 --> 00:05:37,754
add region-wide blackouts...

59
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:40,090
Oh, dear... dear!

60
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:45,762
(doorbell rings)

61
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:51,059
(TV:) We sometimes over use
the phrase "Storm of the Century,"

62
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:54,563
but if these two storms converge...

63
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,773
the phrase
will be no exaggeration.

64
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,735
Next we'll talk
about storm preparation,

65
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,820
no panic here, just practicalities.

66
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:10,037
When they tell you the world's
coming to an end,

67
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,372
they want to sell you cereal.

68
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:16,126
When they tell you not to panic,
it's serious.

69
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:20,631
(doorbell rings)
Oh, hold on!

70
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,759
I'm getting there
as fast as I can!

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:31,183
I broke my hip last summer,
and I'm slow as cold molasses.

72
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,366
Can I help you?

73
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,410
"Born in lust, turn to dust."

74
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:55,999
- I beg you pardon?
- "Born in sin, come on in."

75
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,501
(gasps)

76
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:21,358
(Andre humming)

77
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:31,243
(sings:) "I'm a little teapot,
short and stout...

78
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:35,205
here is my handle,
here is my spout...

79
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:39,126
when I get all steamed up,
here me shout...

80
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:43,964
just tip me over
and pour me out."

81
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,679
(TV narrator:)
...is it the Punishments of God?

82
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:10,490
(TV:)... do it now,
before it's too late.

83
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:39,561
Don't forget the bean supper
next Wednesday-week, Michael...

84
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,231
I'll need every deacon
I can lay my hands on!

85
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,816
I'll be there, if we can
get through the next three days.

86
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:48,904
I'm sure we will,
God takes care of his own.

87
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:52,366
Aren't there any pork chops?
I thought you'd have pork chops.

88
00:08:52,407 --> 00:08:54,117
There you go!

89
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:58,413
Ground chuck's too dear!
Don't you have hamburger?

90
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:07,256
Right here! Okay folks, listen,
it's a storm, that's all...

91
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:09,341
We've gotten through
plenty of these before...

92
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,678
we'll get through plenty after,
so everyone calm down!

93
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,596
Stop acting like mainlanders!

94
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:17,266
Don't be smart, Mike Anderson!

95
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:19,893
No, Mrs. St. Pierre,
I won't be smart.

96
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,604
Yeah?
Hold on just a second.

97
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:26,441
Hey, Mike, you got a call,
it's your wife...

98
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:29,444
she's gotta little problem
at the day-care center.

99
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,864
Uh-oh!
Is she hot under the collar?

100
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:35,158
How do I know where she's hot,
she's your wife!

101
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,494
(laughter)

102
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,705
Hatch, wanna take over for me?

103
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,584
Yo, Mike, can I borrow
your whip and chair?

104
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:46,587
Better go see about that,
huh, Mike?

105
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,508
Hey, Moll, What's up?

106
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:54,428
I got a little problem,
can you come?

107
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,181
I got a little problem
of my own, what's yours?

108
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,141
(kids screaming)
Pippa got her head stuck!

109
00:09:59,183 --> 00:10:01,185
(Pippa wails)

110
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,812
Pippa, can I have your bread
if you're not gonna eat it?

111
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:06,732
No-ooo-oo!
(kids laughing)

112
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:10,319
Pippa, honey, hold still!
Annie, keep her calm.

113
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,197
- Pippa? What about Pippa?
- Please, quiet!

114
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:16,116
The last thing I want
is Alton Hatcher down on me.

115
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,119
Something about Pippa.

116
00:10:22,498 --> 00:10:24,833
It's too late, babe...
What's up?

117
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,212
(sighs) Pippa's got her head
stuck in the stairs...

118
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,255
It's not serious, but...

119
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:34,259
I can't deal with a big storm and
a crazed daddy all in the same day.

120
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:37,554
If Hatch comes, you be with him.

121
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:42,434
- All right, I'll be down.
- What about Pippa?

122
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:45,187
She's got a little stuck-itis.
Let's go see.

123
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:49,358
How upset did she sound, Mike?

124
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:54,404
About point five on the scale
from one to ten. Don't worry.

125
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:58,116
This is gonna be one
bad mother of a storm.

126
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,081
Mike and your daddy will be
here and Mike will get you out.

127
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,584
- I'm hungry!
- Can I feed her, Mrs. Anderson?

128
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,921
I fed a monkey once
at the Bangor Fair.

129
00:11:10,963 --> 00:11:13,090
I'm not a monkey, Harry!

130
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:16,093
Look you guys,
I'm a monkey! Oooh-ooh!

131
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,636
(kids laughing)

132
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,430
I am not a monkey!

133
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,309
All right, kids, stop it.
It's making Pippa sad!

134
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:26,895
Don, you stop!
It's mean!

135
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,218
Don, you need
to stop right now!

136
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,305
Daddy!

137
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:08,270
Pippa! Hold still, you'll yank
your ears right off your head.

138
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:12,274
Pippa got her head stuck,
Don won't stop bein' a monkey.

139
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,694
Mr. Anderson, I stopped bein'
a monkey as soon as she said!

140
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:19,198
That's great, Sally!
I gotta put you down, Ralphie!

141
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:21,325
Ow! Hey, why'd you do that?

142
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,161
For actin' smart.

143
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,121
I ain't afraid of you,
my dad's the town manager...

144
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,623
he pays your salary.

145
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:30,209
Pushers get pushed,
Donnie Beals...

146
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,795
You remember that.
It's a true fact of this sad life...

147
00:12:33,837 --> 00:12:37,132
Pushers get pushed.

148
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:42,846
- Honey, why'd you do this?
- Heidi St. Pierre dared me.

149
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,181
What happened, darlin'?

150
00:12:44,223 --> 00:12:47,392
It was easy goin' out,
but now I can't get back in!

151
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:50,729
I think my head must be
bigger on this side!

152
00:12:50,771 --> 00:12:53,482
It is, but you know
what I'm gonna do?

153
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,526
I'm gonna make it smaller.
You know how?

154
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,861
No! How?

155
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,488
I'm gonna push
your smaller button.

156
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,989
Then you're head'll
get smaller and it'll slide out

157
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,075
just as easily as it slid in.
Understand, Pippa?

158
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,285
(Hatch laughs)

159
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,914
I'm gonna push your button now, okay?
You ready?

160
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,916
- Uh-huh.
- Close your eyes.

161
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,377
Here we go...
BEEP!

162
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,045
Okay, your head's
getting smaller,

163
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:16,797
pull it out before it gets big,
there you go!

164
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:18,799
(kids cheer)
Thanks, boss.

165
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:21,677
- Thank you, really.
- No problem.

166
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,431
I'm sorry if I called
at a bad time...

167
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:30,936
I saw her head like that and
couldn't get it out, I freaked.

168
00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:32,271
You needed a break anyway.

169
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:38,944
- The smaller button, huh?
- Everyone's got one.

170
00:13:49,121 --> 00:13:52,249
Davey Hopewell, in transition...
He avoids the press...

171
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,085
Stockton tries to steal the ball,
but he doesn't have a chance.

172
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,879
It's Davey Hopewell
at the top of the key,

173
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,213
Clock running out...

174
00:13:58,255 --> 00:14:00,007
Davey Hopewell's the Celtics'
only hope...

175
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,675
He shakes, he bakes, he...

176
00:14:01,717 --> 00:14:05,095
(wind blows)

177
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:47,763
(TV:) The jetstream has taken
a pattern which is very typical

178
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:51,350
for this time of year.
The upper flow is stronger than usual...

179
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:20,087
(Davey:) Mrs. Clarendon?
Are you okay?

180
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,648
Mrs. Clarendon?

181
00:15:47,865 --> 00:15:49,700
(door creaks)

182
00:15:51,743 --> 00:15:53,287
(sound of TV)

183
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:59,710
Mrs. Clarendon?
It's Davey. Davey Hopewell?

184
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,879
Are you all right?

185
00:16:06,925 --> 00:16:10,179
Hello?
Anybody here?

186
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:37,539
(Andre:) Forget the NBA, Davey.

187
00:16:37,623 --> 00:16:41,001
You'll never even play
first string in high school.

188
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,920
You're slow...

189
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,255
You're a dwarf!

190
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,133
Why don't you come in here,
I'll do you a favor...

191
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:49,593
save you a lot of grief.

192
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:51,762
No! Help!
Help! Help!

193
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,014
Somebody killed Mrs. Clarendon!

194
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:59,228
Help, somebody, help!
Mrs. Clarendon's dead! Help!

195
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:13,450
He shoots...

196
00:17:13,492 --> 00:17:16,370
He scores.

197
00:17:19,331 --> 00:17:21,458
Help! Please!

198
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:28,006
Help, somebody, help!
Somebody, please!

199
00:17:28,048 --> 00:17:30,759
Get help! Help, please!

200
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,017
David Hopewell!

201
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:40,978
What are you doing,
running down the road

202
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:42,813
making a spectacle of
yourself?

203
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,648
Someone killed Mrs. Clarendon!

204
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:46,817
That's nonsense,
what are you talking about?

205
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:49,486
There's blood everywhere,
and one of her eyes is out!

206
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:53,365
- Davey, just calm down...
- It's on her cheek...!

207
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:57,619
Mrs. Kingsbury, look after him,
give him some hot tea...

208
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,372
better yet, some whiskey
if you have any.

209
00:18:00,414 --> 00:18:01,874
You gonna tell Mike Anderson?

210
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:04,418
Not until I've had a look first.

211
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,962
There's more than one thing
that a town manager can do.

212
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,550
You want help, Robbie Beals?

213
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,094
That won't be necessary, George.
I'll be fine.

214
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:17,306
(Davey:) Careful, Mr. Beals.
I think the guy's still inside.

215
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:23,979
(honks horn)

216
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:54,968
(swing creaks)

217
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:17,741
- Wanna come in?
- Nah, I'm fine.

218
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:18,992
Hey, boss?

219
00:19:19,034 --> 00:19:21,245
Thanks for seein' after my
little girl.

220
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:22,788
My pleasure.

221
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,341
(waves crash)

222
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,252
(bell chimes)

223
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,964
(Ursula:) We haven't heard
any more than you have...

224
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,425
Not the memorial bell,
not with the winds we're having...

225
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:18,510
It'll be the siren,
if it comes to that.

226
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,931
Two shorts, and one long,
that's right.

227
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:28,103
...Mike Anderson, of course.

228
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:34,860
Those are the decisions
we pay him to make, aren't they?

229
00:20:34,902 --> 00:20:37,863
Yeah, I'll say hello
to Peter for ya.

230
00:20:37,863 --> 00:20:40,240
Thanks for calling, Betty.

231
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,952
Tough day, huh?

232
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:48,582
Betty Soames thinks we have
access to some secret forecast.

233
00:20:48,624 --> 00:20:53,003
Some kind of Jeanne Dixon
psychic weather forecast?

234
00:20:53,045 --> 00:20:55,130
I guess, yeah...

235
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,174
Urse, have most people in town
seen this stuff?

236
00:20:57,216 --> 00:21:02,012
If they're not blind, they have.
Y'need to relax, Mike Anderson.

237
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,014
How's little Pippa Hatcher?

238
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:09,019
- Whoa, that was fast!
- No secrets on the island!

239
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:12,064
She's fine, she got her head
stuck in the stairs.

240
00:21:12,105 --> 00:21:14,024
(laughter)

241
00:21:14,066 --> 00:21:18,195
Her dad's in the car doin'
homework for the big blow of '89.

242
00:21:18,237 --> 00:21:23,492
Just like Alton and Melinda
Hatcher's daughter... perfect.

243
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,619
People know this one's bad, Mike.

244
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,872
If they hear the siren, they'll come.
You needn't worry.

245
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:32,042
You came to see the emergency
shelter setup, didn't you?

246
00:21:32,084 --> 00:21:34,545
Thought it might not be a bad idea.

247
00:21:34,586 --> 00:21:38,841
We can handle 300 for 3 days,
150 for a week...

248
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:42,719
If what I'm hearin' on the
radio is right, we may have to.

249
00:21:46,014 --> 00:21:50,519
(TV:) When life hands you lemons
we can help you make lemonade...

250
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:54,314
...Stick it to them,
before they stick it to you.

251
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,984
Anybody here?

252
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,781
You may have thousands
of dollars waiting for you...

253
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:19,423
Oh my God...

254
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,884
(TV shuts off)

255
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:34,104
- Good?
- You know it is.

256
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,731
How's the supply closet?

257
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:39,276
Full, just like you wanted.
Concentrates, mostly...

258
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:42,446
Pour the water over the powder
and gag it down...

259
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:44,281
But nobody will starve.

260
00:22:44,323 --> 00:22:47,117
- You do all this yourself?
- Me and Pete's sister, Tavia...

261
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,121
"Be discreet," you said.
"Don't panic anyone."

262
00:22:51,163 --> 00:22:52,623
That's what I said...

263
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:55,959
So how many people know we're
stocked for World War III?

264
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:57,419
Everyone.

265
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:33,205
Who are you?

266
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:37,668
"Born in sin,
come on in."

267
00:23:40,045 --> 00:23:43,799
You were with a whore in Boston
when your mother died.

268
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:47,469
Ma was in that old nursing home
they tore down last fall.

269
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:50,138
The one with the rats
in the pantry, right?

270
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:56,436
She choked to death calling your name.
Isn't that sweet?

271
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,730
But that's all right, Robbie...

272
00:23:58,772 --> 00:24:03,277
She's waiting for you in hell,
and she's turned cannibal...

273
00:24:03,318 --> 00:24:07,364
When you get there,
she's going to eat you alive...

274
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:11,243
Over and over and over again...

275
00:24:11,285 --> 00:24:15,998
That's what hell is all about,
Robbie... Repetition.

276
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,877
I think in our hearts,
most of us know that.

277
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,046
Catch!

278
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:31,346
Oh!

279
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:37,853
(TV:) Let's check the area
to be most affected by the storm...

280
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:40,355
The forecast calls for
destruction tonight...

281
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:43,275
death tomorrow...
and Armageddon by the weekend.

282
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:46,278
This could be the end
of life as we know it.

283
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,325
Seems unlikely,
but we can always hope.

284
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:06,423
This is Robbie Beals
for Constable Anderson...

285
00:25:06,465 --> 00:25:09,176
(radio:)... this is an
emergency!

286
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,431
Come back, damn it, Anderson!
We got a murder down here...

287
00:25:14,473 --> 00:25:16,391
Martha Clarendon's
been beaten to death...

288
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:18,519
...the man who did this
is still in the house!

289
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,444
Come back, Anderson...
Can you hear me?

290
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:35,911
He's always around when it comes
to unwanted advice, where is he?

291
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:39,957
(radio:) Isn't there anybody
listening on this thing?

292
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:46,463
- Anderson!
- Robbie, This is Tess Marchant.

293
00:25:46,505 --> 00:25:49,883
I don't want you,
I want Anderson!

294
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:51,927
I can't do his job
and mine as well!

295
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:55,180
He had an emergency at home.
Alton went with him.

296
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,431
What do you mean,
emergency at home...

297
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,141
There's an emergency
right here!

298
00:25:58,183 --> 00:25:59,643
There's a woman
murdered...

299
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,646
We got a lunatic in
Martha Clarendon's living room!

300
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:04,106
What's he talking about?
Who's murdered?

301
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,983
Martha, he says.

302
00:26:06,024 --> 00:26:08,235
Robbie, I'm here.
Just a minute.

303
00:26:08,277 --> 00:26:12,155
You folks, back off now.
Gimme a little privacy.

304
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:16,285
You pay me 6,000 a year to be constable,
let me do the job you pay me for.

305
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,537
Where are you, Robbie,
come back?

306
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:23,959
Where am I?
I'm at Martha Clarendon's house!

307
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:27,087
Where do you think I am?

308
00:26:27,129 --> 00:26:32,718
I'm keeping the man inside at bay.

309
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:35,429
Now you get your ass down here!

310
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:44,062
Let's take another ride,
all right?

311
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,200
You and Kat mind the store.

312
00:26:59,578 --> 00:27:03,290
All right, folks, stay here
and finish your shopping...

313
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:05,209
There's nothing that you can do
down on Atlantic Avenue.

314
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:09,963
Snow's early.

315
00:27:10,005 --> 00:27:12,716
Look at the mainland...
Can't see over there no more...

316
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,968
It's time to get in
while you can.

317
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,721
Can't even see
the reach no more...

318
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,057
Time to head down
to the Town Hall...

319
00:27:20,098 --> 00:27:23,352
Whether you've heard
the siren or not.

320
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:36,698
- Want the shotgun?
- Yep, better have it.

321
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,077
Just make sure that safety's on,
Alton Hatcher.

322
00:27:40,118 --> 00:27:43,288
Well, it's about time!

323
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:45,749
- Put that thing away!
- No such thing, constable...

324
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,126
you do your job,
and I'll do mine.

325
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:55,259
Your job is real estate.
Wanna at least lower it, please?

326
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,929
C'mon, Robbie, it's in my face,
and I know it's loaded.

327
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:06,103
(opens pistol)
All right, what happened?

328
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:09,189
I was driving
to the Town Office...

329
00:28:09,231 --> 00:28:13,443
I saw Davey Hopewell running
down the street, screaming

330
00:28:13,485 --> 00:28:16,238
that Martha Clarendon's dead,
and that somebody killed her!

331
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,116
I came down here,
and it's true...

332
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:22,244
she's... awful.

333
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,832
The one that did it
is still inside?

334
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:30,544
He spoke to me.

335
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:33,797
What did he say?

336
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:34,673
He told me to get out...

337
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:37,551
He said, "You get out or I'll
kill you too!" I don't know!

338
00:28:37,593 --> 00:28:39,803
This isn't
the time for an interrogation!

339
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:42,556
What did he look like?

340
00:28:42,598 --> 00:28:44,474
I barely got a look at him.

341
00:28:45,809 --> 00:28:49,271
Hatch, you stay at my left,
keep the barrel of that gun

342
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:50,439
pointed toward the ground.

343
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,608
Leave that safety on until
I tell you to take it off.

344
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:55,777
And you, you stay exactly
where you are, please.

345
00:28:55,819 --> 00:28:57,779
You're the constable.

346
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,328
I'd be careful if I was you!

347
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:11,585
Even if there is a guy,
he's probably gone by now.

348
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:14,296
She ain't got but
a five-foot garden fence.

349
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:23,013
(door creaks)

350
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,685
(TV:)... Order now,
while you still have time...

351
00:29:51,792 --> 00:29:58,090
Oh, my God... Oh, God.
Mike, she's got no face left!

352
00:29:58,131 --> 00:29:59,758
...Oh... God...

353
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:06,890
Hatch, are you gonna be
all right? Hatch?

354
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:12,271
Because if you're not, I want
you to hand me that 12 gauge...

355
00:30:12,312 --> 00:30:16,066
...and go back out to Robbie.
- I'm okay.

356
00:30:16,108 --> 00:30:18,110
- Are you sure?
- Aye.

357
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:20,696
(TV shuts off)

358
00:30:58,734 --> 00:31:01,028
Freeze!!

359
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:04,823
Raise your hands!

360
00:31:04,865 --> 00:31:09,620
Up over the chair.
I wanna see them clear as day!

361
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:12,206
You got two guns
pointed at you!

362
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:14,166
One of them's a scatter!

363
00:31:21,548 --> 00:31:24,092
Put your hands together.

364
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,146
Robbie...

365
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:39,816
- What happened to Martha?
- Just stand back!

366
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:42,277
This is under control!

367
00:31:46,824 --> 00:31:48,617
(draws handcuffs)

368
00:31:52,538 --> 00:31:55,165
If he moves, shoot him.

369
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:56,917
Aye.

370
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,508
If he shoots,
he'll get us both.

371
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,510
That thing's still loaded
with buckshot.

372
00:32:06,552 --> 00:32:09,513
Also... he's still got
the safety on.

373
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,062
(safety clicks)

374
00:32:23,944 --> 00:32:25,904
(handcuffs lock)

375
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,326
But you remembered
to wear gloves.

376
00:32:33,745 --> 00:32:35,706
That was good.

377
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,005
On your feet.

378
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,844
(wind gusting)

379
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:55,726
Hatch, close the door.

380
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:59,438
Is that wise? This bein'
a crime scene and all...

381
00:32:59,479 --> 00:33:01,899
you think we should
leave things the way they are?

382
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,150
Leave the door open...

383
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:06,528
the crime scene's gonna be
under six feet of fresh powder.

384
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,696
Hold on!

385
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,328
What's your name?

386
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,624
Andre Linoge.

387
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:25,714
All right, let's go.

388
00:33:37,976 --> 00:33:39,978
Pip, you sure you're all right?

389
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:43,774
Don Beals hurt my feelings,
but they're better now.

390
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,943
I'm sorry I had to
call you early, guys.

391
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:48,946
That's okay. The radio says
they're gonna keep

392
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,824
the bigger kids over in Machais
at least tonight.

393
00:33:51,865 --> 00:33:55,536
The reach is too choppy
to send them back by waterbus.

394
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,080
- Mommy, I'm cold
- Of course you are!

395
00:33:58,121 --> 00:34:00,582
You'll warm up in the car.
Are there more?

396
00:34:00,624 --> 00:34:04,753
No, Buster and Pip
were the last.

397
00:34:04,795 --> 00:34:08,507
Pippa, you had quite an
adventure today, didn't you?

398
00:34:08,549 --> 00:34:10,050
Yeah.

399
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:11,635
Good to see you, Melinda.
Take care.

400
00:34:11,677 --> 00:34:13,637
You too. 'Bye.

401
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:17,182
And thank you for being such
a good helper today, Buster.

402
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:19,518
Okay.

403
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,437
We'll see you Monday,
if the roads are open!

404
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:24,815
Wave her 'bye, Buster.

405
00:34:24,857 --> 00:34:28,443
- You drive safely, Angie.'Bye.
- 'Bye!

406
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:30,487
(phone rings)

407
00:34:32,114 --> 00:34:33,574
Hello?

408
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:37,327
There you are, I've been trying
to reach you for ten minutes.

409
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:40,122
I've been on the porch handing
kids over to their parents.

410
00:34:40,164 --> 00:34:42,291
I sent them home early.
What's up, Katrina?

411
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:45,252
I don't want you to be scared,

412
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:48,672
but we got word there's been
a murder on the island.

413
00:34:48,714 --> 00:34:53,510
Martha Clarendon. Mike and Hatch
just went over there.

414
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:55,304
Are you sure?

415
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:58,348
I'm not really sure
about anything right now...

416
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,351
This place has been
a madhouse all day...

417
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:04,313
They went over there and
Mike wanted me to call you

418
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,523
just to let you know that
everything's under control.

419
00:35:06,565 --> 00:35:11,487
- Is it?
- Yeah... Probably.

420
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:15,532
Anyway, he wanted me to call you
before anyone else did.

421
00:35:15,574 --> 00:35:17,784
So, if you see
Melinda Hatcher...

422
00:35:17,826 --> 00:35:23,290
She just left with Angie Carver,
they're carpooling...

423
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:27,628
you can reach them at home
in 15 minutes or so...

424
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:30,380
But you better
make that 20.

425
00:35:30,422 --> 00:35:36,386
There's no chance that this
is a joke or a prank?

426
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:40,682
No. Robbie Beals called it in,

427
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,519
he doesn't exactly do humor,
you know?

428
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,854
Yeah, I know.

429
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:49,900
He said the person who
did this might still be there.

430
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:53,570
I don't know if Mike
would want me to tell you that,

431
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:57,991
but I thought you had
the right to know.

432
00:35:59,117 --> 00:36:00,577
Molly?

433
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:04,706
I'm coming down to the store...

434
00:36:04,748 --> 00:36:07,668
If Mike gets there before I do,
you tell him to stay put.

435
00:36:07,709 --> 00:36:10,420
- I don't think he'd...
- Thanks, Kat.

436
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:15,092
Hey, Ralphie, honey! Let's go to
the market and see your daddy.

437
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:17,427
- What do you say?
- Daddy! Yay!

438
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:20,055
Yay! Let's get you dressed.

439
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:24,601
What, are you gonna
put him in there?

440
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:27,437
Not unless you wanna get in
the back seat and baby-sit.

441
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:29,106
Get in there, Mister.

442
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,525
Put that down!

443
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:38,240
Remember what I said, Robbie...
Hell is repetition!

444
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,743
He talks a lot of nonsense!

445
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,215
I think he's crazy!

446
00:36:55,257 --> 00:36:58,635
How'd he know your name?
Did you tell him?

447
00:36:58,677 --> 00:37:03,682
I don't know... but no sane
person would hurt Martha.

448
00:37:05,851 --> 00:37:09,146
I'll come to the store
and help clear this up.

449
00:37:09,188 --> 00:37:11,481
We're gonna have to get in touch
with the State Police!

450
00:37:11,523 --> 00:37:13,192
Robbie, I know this goes
against your grain...

451
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,152
but you're going to have to
let me handle this!

452
00:37:15,194 --> 00:37:18,989
I am the town manager,
I've got responsibilities!

453
00:37:19,031 --> 00:37:22,493
So do I, and they're clearly
divided in the town charter!

454
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:24,953
Ursula needs you a lot more
at the Town Hall than...

455
00:37:24,995 --> 00:37:26,955
I need you at the constable's.
Come on, Hatch.

456
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:29,333
You're getting
a little big for your britches!

457
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:08,038
The store! Yay!

458
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,581
"Yay" is right.

459
00:38:17,548 --> 00:38:22,302
Mommy, are you
feeling all right?

460
00:38:22,344 --> 00:38:24,721
I'm fine, honey.

461
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:42,614
(signs creaking)

462
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:51,081
- What're we gonna do with him?
- Keep your voice down!

463
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:54,918
We'll have to try and raise
the State Police barracks.

464
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,087
Robbie was right
about that much...

465
00:38:57,129 --> 00:39:02,384
But what are the chances they'll
take him off our hands in this?

466
00:39:06,763 --> 00:39:09,057
Hatch...

467
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:13,145
When we were in the hall,
I heard the TV on, did you?

468
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:19,109
At first, yeah. The weather.
Then the guy must've...

469
00:39:20,736 --> 00:39:24,740
But it was busted,
busted all to hell and gone...

470
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:26,241
He didn't do it while we were
in the hallway either...

471
00:39:26,325 --> 00:39:29,870
You bust a TV picture tube,
it makes a sound, like BOOF!

472
00:39:29,912 --> 00:39:32,789
We would have heard it.

473
00:39:32,789 --> 00:39:35,709
Must have been the radio...

474
00:39:42,716 --> 00:39:45,677
(hissing)

475
00:39:51,183 --> 00:39:53,727
(engine cranking)

476
00:40:28,929 --> 00:40:30,347
(Hatch whistles)

477
00:40:35,769 --> 00:40:38,313
- Safety off?
- Yeah.

478
00:40:38,397 --> 00:40:40,274
Up top.

479
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:53,954
Step out,
come up on the dock.

480
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:06,008
(wind howling)

481
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,437
(keys jingle)

482
00:41:20,564 --> 00:41:22,482
(key breaks)

483
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,735
Shoot!

484
00:41:24,735 --> 00:41:26,195
Snapped off...

485
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:28,155
Must be the cold.

486
00:41:29,531 --> 00:41:31,700
(banging on door)

487
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:42,544
Anybody in there?
(bangs on door)

488
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:46,089
All right, never mind.
Open it from the other side.

489
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:48,759
Want me to leave you
out here alone with him?

490
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,929
Unless you see Superman
hanging out in the alley...

491
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:54,056
Maybe we could bring him
around the front?

492
00:41:54,097 --> 00:41:57,226
Through the store? With everyone
doing their storm shopping?

493
00:41:57,267 --> 00:41:59,228
I don't think so.
Go on, now.

494
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,262
(propeller flutters)

495
00:42:40,853 --> 00:42:42,980
What happened, Beals?
Is Martha really dead?

496
00:42:43,021 --> 00:42:44,731
She's dead, all right.

497
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:54,324
- You haven't heard from them?
- I haven't heard from them.

498
00:42:54,366 --> 00:42:55,325
(boots flap)

499
00:42:57,536 --> 00:42:58,662
Hatch!

500
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,918
- Hi, Molly.
- Where's Mike, is he all right?

501
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,379
He's out back with the prisoner,
I have to let him in.

502
00:43:07,421 --> 00:43:08,672
Is he a local?

503
00:43:08,714 --> 00:43:10,757
I never saw him before
in my life.

504
00:43:13,677 --> 00:43:15,846
What are they doin' out back?

505
00:43:23,604 --> 00:43:26,732
Give me what I want
and I'll go away.

506
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:31,195
What is it you want?

507
00:43:57,721 --> 00:44:01,642
- Uh, Mike?
- Hurry up, it's freezing!

508
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:02,976
It won't open,
it's stuck!

509
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:05,896
Did you unlock it?

510
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:08,190
Of course I did.

511
00:44:08,232 --> 00:44:10,984
Then whale on it!
Probably ice stuck in the jamb.

512
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,986
(continues to bang)

513
00:44:15,697 --> 00:44:18,492
Here, let me.

514
00:44:30,462 --> 00:44:35,676
Anderson! You're gonna have
to take him through the store.

515
00:44:35,717 --> 00:44:41,014
- Hatch, come around. Alone.
- Right there.

516
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,934
(shivering breath)

517
00:44:43,976 --> 00:44:46,770
Remember what I said,
Mr. Anderson...

518
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:51,233
And when the time comes,
we'll talk.

519
00:45:30,439 --> 00:45:32,441
Go on.

520
00:45:37,488 --> 00:45:40,616
Hold up.
Go ahead, Hatch.

521
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:50,501
(bell rings)

522
00:45:55,088 --> 00:45:58,509
Mike wants you folks to move
back on both sides...

523
00:45:58,509 --> 00:46:00,344
no one in Aisle Two.

524
00:46:00,385 --> 00:46:02,679
We got us a bad guy and we can't
bring him in through the back

525
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:06,517
like we'd like to, so move back,
give us some room.

526
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:09,603
- Why'd he kill her?
- Could you move back, Pete...

527
00:46:09,645 --> 00:46:13,440
Mike's been out in the snow,
and his feet are pretty cold.

528
00:46:13,482 --> 00:46:17,486
We'll all feel better once
we get this guy locked up...

529
00:46:17,528 --> 00:46:21,573
Just move back and give us a
clear way up the second aisle.

530
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:22,533
Aye...

531
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:28,038
Not one wrong move,
Mr. Linoge...

532
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,540
You mind me, now.

533
00:46:37,214 --> 00:46:38,674
Mike?

534
00:46:55,941 --> 00:46:59,528
Straight down the aisle.
Nowhere else.

535
00:46:59,570 --> 00:47:01,113
C'mon, let's go.

536
00:47:08,036 --> 00:47:10,080
Peter Godsoe!

537
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:16,545
My favorite seafood wholesaler
with my favorite politician.

538
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:19,840
How's the fish business?
Not so good, is it?

539
00:47:19,882 --> 00:47:23,177
Lucky you've got the marijuana
business to fall back on.

540
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:26,430
How many bales have you got
in the warehouse now? Ten?

541
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:30,434
Twenty? Forty? Be sure you got
it wrapped good, Pete...

542
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:33,687
There's gonna be a hell of a
surge when the tide comes high!

543
00:47:33,729 --> 00:47:35,939
C'mon, move!

544
00:47:35,939 --> 00:47:39,985
Kat Withers!
You're lookin' well!

545
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:44,823
Why not? It's an in-office
procedure, nothin' to it.

546
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:47,868
I don't suppose you've told your
folks yet... or Billy.

547
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:49,286
(sobs)

548
00:47:51,288 --> 00:47:53,832
Move...
(click)

549
00:47:53,874 --> 00:47:55,792
Or I'll move ya.

550
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,669
My advice would be to go ahead.

551
00:47:57,711 --> 00:48:00,255
What's a little scrape
between friends these days?

552
00:48:04,259 --> 00:48:05,552
Ralphie...?

553
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:09,765
Mama, can I have...

554
00:48:13,143 --> 00:48:14,478
Put him down!!

555
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,395
Or...?

556
00:48:17,689 --> 00:48:19,817
- I know you!
- You do?

557
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:22,444
You're Ralph Emerick Anderson.

558
00:48:22,486 --> 00:48:24,822
- And I know something else...
- What?

559
00:48:24,863 --> 00:48:27,449
You've got a fairy saddle
on your nose!

560
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:33,831
That's what my daddy calls it!

561
00:48:33,872 --> 00:48:37,084
You bet.
Speaking of your daddy...

562
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,548
Why are you wearing those?

563
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:43,090
(gasps)

564
00:48:44,675 --> 00:48:48,512
Because I choose to.
Go on, go see your dad.

565
00:48:50,013 --> 00:48:51,348
- Get him out of here!
- Ralphie! Mike!

566
00:48:52,558 --> 00:48:55,060
Get him outta here!!

567
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:58,021
Don't shoot him, Daddy...
He knows about the fairy saddle!

568
00:48:58,063 --> 00:49:01,358
I'm not gonna shoot him if he
goes where he's supposed to.

569
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:05,320
What do you know about Katrina?
How do you know?!

570
00:49:05,362 --> 00:49:08,031
Are you crazy?!
Gat away from him!

571
00:49:08,073 --> 00:49:10,075
This man's a killer!

572
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:12,536
Stay out of his way,
Billy Soames...

573
00:49:12,536 --> 00:49:16,165
- Stay out of mine, too.
- Also, clean yourself up.

574
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:21,170
Billy...?

575
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:28,969
Leave me alone!

576
00:49:29,011 --> 00:49:30,929
Before he gets too
self-righteous, Katrina...

577
00:49:30,971 --> 00:49:34,057
ask him how well he knows
Jenna Freeman.

578
00:49:35,517 --> 00:49:37,186
What do you know
about my sister?

579
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:39,396
That horses aren't all
she enjoys riding

580
00:49:39,396 --> 00:49:42,274
when the weather's hot.
Right, Billy?

581
00:49:46,653 --> 00:49:48,697
Keep away from this man,
all of you!

582
00:49:57,915 --> 00:50:00,042
(crash outside)

583
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,294
I don't like the sound of that.

584
00:50:02,336 --> 00:50:03,795
Move, Mr. Linoge.

585
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:07,925
Put your hands up...
grab the bars.

586
00:50:11,887 --> 00:50:14,097
Now, spread your legs...

587
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:15,098
Wider.

588
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:20,729
I'm gonna pat you down.

589
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:24,525
If you move, my friend Alton
will save us a lot of trouble...

590
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:32,407
Don't even twitch,
Mr. Linoge.

591
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:36,495
You put your filthy hands
on my son...

592
00:50:36,537 --> 00:50:39,122
so don't you so much as twitch.

593
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,709
(puts rifle down)

594
00:51:20,122 --> 00:51:22,708
All right,
where's your wallet?

595
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:27,337
Where's your wallet, huh?

596
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:30,757
(slap)
Mike, take it easy.

597
00:51:34,094 --> 00:51:40,058
He put his hands on my son...
Put his face in my son's face...

598
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,312
Kissed my son's nose.
Don't tell me to take it easy.

599
00:51:45,689 --> 00:51:47,274
Where's your wallet, sir?

600
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:50,360
(bangs bars)
WHERE'S YOUR WALLET?!

601
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:51,987
- Where's your bankcard...
- Mike...

602
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:53,155
- Where's your blood-donor card?
- Mike...!

603
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:56,033
Where's your Discount Card
from Value Mart?

604
00:51:56,074 --> 00:52:00,037
What sewer did you crawl through
to get here? Answer me!!

605
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:03,165
Where's your wallet?!
WHERE'S YOUR WALLET?!

606
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:08,545
Stop it! Stop it!
Mike, what are you doing?

607
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:25,312
Take your boots off.

608
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:28,565
I'll have to let go of the bars
to do that.

609
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:30,526
They lace up.

610
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:39,660
If you move, you'll never have
constipation problems again!

611
00:52:42,454 --> 00:52:44,331
Kick 'em off.

612
00:52:44,373 --> 00:52:47,668
(boots hit floor)

613
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,306
- Nothing.
- Put 'em over by the desk.

614
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:14,528
Step into the cell, Mr. Linoge.

615
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:17,698
Move slowly, keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

616
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:22,953
(latch clatters)

617
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,706
(keys rattle)

618
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,687
You don't think it'll hold you?

619
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:55,652
Lt'll hold you.

620
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:05,245
(door bolt clicks)

621
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,751
I... I swear, Mike.
It wouldn't budge.

622
00:54:14,338 --> 00:54:16,173
(rattles handle)

623
00:54:28,852 --> 00:54:30,604
Don't touch that!!

624
00:54:30,646 --> 00:54:35,025
Did you check to see if he has
any identification on him?

625
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:38,695
- I want you out of here.
- I wanna tell you, Anderson...

626
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:41,323
Your sense of humor
is entirely not funny.

627
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,116
I don't have the time
or patience for this...

628
00:54:43,158 --> 00:54:45,577
Now, you get out,
or I'll throw you out!

629
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:46,954
Come Town Meeting,

630
00:54:46,995 --> 00:54:49,998
we're gonna have a change in
law enforcement on Little Tall.

631
00:54:50,874 --> 00:54:52,960
Town Meeting's in March,
this is February...

632
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:54,503
now get the hell out!

633
00:55:04,763 --> 00:55:08,433
I think I handled that well,
don't you?

634
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:09,601
Like a diplomat.

635
00:55:09,643 --> 00:55:11,687
(sighs)

636
00:55:16,358 --> 00:55:20,571
- I gotta tell Molly...
- You're gonna leave me alone?

637
00:55:22,781 --> 00:55:25,325
You try to raise the State
Police in Machais.

638
00:55:25,367 --> 00:55:30,747
- And keep away from him.
- You can count on that.

639
00:55:43,177 --> 00:55:47,639
Come back. Are you there?
Do you read me, Machais?

640
00:55:51,351 --> 00:55:53,854
We've lost contact
with the mainland.

641
00:55:56,565 --> 00:55:58,692
(crowd murmurs)

642
00:56:02,779 --> 00:56:08,911
- Peter Godsoe, Peter?
- Mike, what that fellow said...

643
00:56:08,952 --> 00:56:10,954
it's the biggest crock of stuff
I ever heard.

644
00:56:10,954 --> 00:56:13,665
Yeah. Look, I want you to go
back there with Hatch...

645
00:56:13,707 --> 00:56:15,501
We're gonna watch this guy,
with the buddy system.

646
00:56:15,542 --> 00:56:17,794
Sure, okay, you bet.

647
00:56:19,838 --> 00:56:24,426
I have to close the store.
Take what you've got...

648
00:56:24,468 --> 00:56:26,803
I trust you to settle up
after the storm.

649
00:56:26,845 --> 00:56:29,348
Right now I've got a
prisoner to deal with.

650
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:32,434
Did that man really kill
poor old Martha?

651
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,728
In time, we'll have
the whole story, but not now.

652
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:40,692
Please, all of you, please,
just help me do my job.

653
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:45,280
I want a few of you men to hang
around for a couple minutes...

654
00:56:45,322 --> 00:56:47,199
Kirk Freeman,
Jack Carver...

655
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:50,619
Sonny Brautigan,
Johnny Harriman, Billy...

656
00:56:50,661 --> 00:56:54,373
uh, Robbie...

657
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:56,625
Machais, this is Alton Hatcher
on Little Tall...

658
00:56:56,667 --> 00:57:01,255
We have a police emergency here!
Do you read, Machais?

659
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:02,881
(static)

660
00:57:02,923 --> 00:57:06,677
Machais, this is Alton Hatcher,
Channel one-nine, do you read?

661
00:57:06,718 --> 00:57:11,181
They don't. You lost your
good antenna off the roof.

662
00:57:11,181 --> 00:57:12,766
Try the phone.

663
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:19,148
(rattles phone receiver)

664
00:57:19,189 --> 00:57:22,693
Better take the truck,
won't get 300 yards in the car...

665
00:57:22,734 --> 00:57:24,778
Never seen it come down
so hard and fast.

666
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,739
Billy, would you give Molly
a hand with the carseat?

667
00:57:27,781 --> 00:57:30,534
- Sure, Mike.
- I'll take the service truck...

668
00:57:30,576 --> 00:57:33,162
and get a lift when I get
things squared away.

669
00:57:33,203 --> 00:57:39,126
I've gotta go back to Martha's,
long enough to get it secured.

670
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,920
Be careful.

671
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:44,590
(hangs up phone)

672
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:48,093
No? Lt was a long shot.

673
00:57:51,889 --> 00:57:54,725
You don't really have a load
of Panama Red

674
00:57:54,725 --> 00:57:57,644
behind your lobster traps,
do ya Pete?

675
00:58:01,064 --> 00:58:03,400
Mommy, the island won't
blow away, will it?

676
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:05,777
No, honey, of course not.

677
00:58:06,778 --> 00:58:09,239
(gusty wind)

678
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:16,580
- C'mon, honey...
- Mike was right...

679
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,500
You'd never make it in your car.
Drive safe, Molly.

680
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:20,792
Thanks, Billy.

681
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:24,880
We'll be home soon.

682
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,578
Aww, damn!

683
00:59:41,331 --> 00:59:43,167
- Hey, look at him!
- What?

684
00:59:46,003 --> 00:59:48,922
- What?
- I, uh...

685
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:53,302
...nothing.

686
00:59:54,344 --> 00:59:57,055
You been smokin' too much
of what you been sellin', Pete.

687
00:59:57,097 --> 00:59:59,057
Hey, shut up, Hatch.

688
00:59:59,099 --> 01:00:03,312
You don't talk about
what you don't understand.

689
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:29,463
Hey, Pete.

690
01:00:29,505 --> 01:00:31,590
I was out of line there.

691
01:00:31,632 --> 01:00:32,925
Yeah.

692
01:00:35,219 --> 01:00:37,679
Way out.

693
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,737
What are you looking at?

694
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:08,961
Gonna be all right?
I can give you a lift home.

695
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:11,922
It's the wrong direction.

696
01:01:11,964 --> 01:01:15,551
I'm only six houses
down as you well know.

697
01:01:15,592 --> 01:01:17,719
Don't baby me.

698
01:01:17,761 --> 01:01:20,097
Come on,
let's get the other one.

699
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,688
Mike.

700
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:29,815
Do you have any idea
why he came here?

701
01:01:29,857 --> 01:01:32,276
Why he'd want to kill Martha?

702
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:33,610
No.

703
01:01:33,610 --> 01:01:35,988
Why don't you go on home, Tess?

704
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:38,240
I'll lock up.

705
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,967
- Everything ok?
- Reasonably ok.

706
01:01:57,009 --> 01:01:58,927
I couldn't raise
the State Police in Machais.

707
01:01:58,969 --> 01:02:00,679
Couldn't raise anybody.

708
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,973
Well, that doesn't really
surprise me.

709
01:02:03,015 --> 01:02:05,142
All right, here's
the duty roster, Hatch.

710
01:02:05,184 --> 01:02:06,977
You and Peter until 8:00 pm.

711
01:02:06,977 --> 01:02:09,104
Kirk and Jack 8:00 pm
until midnight.

712
01:02:09,146 --> 01:02:11,398
Robbie and Sonny
midnight to 4:00 am...

713
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:15,110
Billy and Johnny 4:00 am
until 8:00 in the morning.

714
01:02:15,152 --> 01:02:17,279
After that, we'll figure
something else out.

715
01:02:17,321 --> 01:02:19,031
You ok with that?

716
01:02:19,072 --> 01:02:20,741
- Yeah.
- Yeah, fine.

717
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:25,746
All right, now. You stay alert.
Both of you.

718
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:35,756
Later on we're going to have
that talk you wanted, sir.

719
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,218
Hey, Mike.

720
01:02:39,259 --> 01:02:41,595
What do we do with him
if Ursula and Robbie

721
01:02:41,637 --> 01:02:43,847
blow the town whistle
and bring everybody in?

722
01:02:43,889 --> 01:02:46,683
We can't very well put him
in the Town Hall basement

723
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:48,727
with a blanket and
a cup of chowder.

724
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:50,729
I don't know.
Stay here with him, I guess.

725
01:02:50,771 --> 01:02:52,189
Well, what if he blows away?

726
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:54,483
You want to go home, Pete?

727
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:55,859
No.

728
01:09:09,233 --> 01:09:11,235
I'm so sorry, old girl.

729
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:39,847
What was that?

730
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:43,267
Tree. Robichaux's
backyard from the sound.

731
01:09:43,308 --> 01:09:46,770
Hope it didn't
hit their porch.

732
01:09:46,812 --> 01:09:49,815
Jack, do you have to go
back to the store today?

733
01:09:49,857 --> 01:09:51,191
Yeah.

734
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:53,110
Daddy's going to guard
the bad guy

735
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:56,738
and make sure he doesn't
get away in a plane.

736
01:09:56,780 --> 01:10:00,409
That's right, big guy.
It's a bad situation, hon.

737
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,119
Everybody's got
to do their part.

738
01:10:02,161 --> 01:10:04,454
Besides, I'll be with Kirk.
It's the buddy system.

739
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:07,249
If you hear the whistle,
you just take Buster and go.

740
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,251
Hell, go before then if
you get nervous.

741
01:10:09,293 --> 01:10:10,794
Bundle up,
take the snowmobile.

742
01:10:10,794 --> 01:10:14,173
- Are you sure?
- Fact is, the earlier you go...

743
01:10:14,214 --> 01:10:16,800
the better choice of beds
you and Buster are apt to have.

744
01:10:16,842 --> 01:10:19,928
People are headed that way already.
I seen the lights.

745
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,097
Now you be here or there
when my watch is over.

746
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:25,601
It don't matter.
I'll find you.

747
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:19,154
Hey, Pete. What do you
suppose this one is?

748
01:11:19,196 --> 01:11:22,741
Yodeler's perch.
Three letters.

749
01:11:24,952 --> 01:11:26,578
Alp.

750
01:11:33,377 --> 01:11:35,504
Of course it is.

751
01:11:35,546 --> 01:11:37,798
This is a great program.

752
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:40,092
I'll let you try it later
on if you want.

753
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:41,552
Sure.
