00:05:45,911 --> 00:05:46,889

Let us outta here!

78
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:00,561
Not until you apologize

Novv, do it! Y'all better be careful.
I just had my fiber.

00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:07,771
- Sorry, mafam.
- We're sorry.

81
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,711
Y'all need to take care
of this community and everybody in it.

82
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:12,612
Like <i>you</i> did?

83
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:15,449
Finally y'all find the gas pedal, huh?

84
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,579
- Mabel Simmons, you're under arrest.
- What the- What the What?

85
00:06:18,677 --> 00:06:20,588
That's the criminal right there.
What did I do?

86
00:06:20,679 --> 00:06:23,353
Well, for starters,
excessive damage to public property.

87
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,055
- Two bench warrants.
- What I ever do to a bench?

88
00:06:26,151 --> 00:06:30,065
- 25 unpaid parking tickets.
- An unpaid speeding ticket.

89
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,965
Beautiful clay, isn't it'? Very mild.

90
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:40,407
Nice, cool breeze
blovvin' through my hair.

91
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,241
That ain't gonna work.

92
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,784
And as if all those charges
arerft bad enough...

93
00:06:47,873 --> 00:06:50,820
you harassed two poor,
innocent children.

94
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,412
Hovv does the defendant plead?

95
00:06:52,511 --> 00:06:55,651
Now, Your Honor, these children
needed to learn some respect.

96
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,694
And with me as their teacher,
guess What?

97
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:01,253
They learned quick.
Yes, they did. Yes, they did.

98
00:07:01,353 --> 00:07:02,832
- Guilty!
- Your Honor-

99
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,163
- Knookin' clown a poor, innocent lady.
- Guilty!

100
00:07:05,257 --> 00:07:09,000
I better not run into them in a dark alley,
I'm gonna tell you that right now.

101
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:10,573
Guilty, guilty, guilty!

102
00:07:14,099 --> 00:07:15,669
- Your Honor!
- Guilty!

103
00:07:19,438 --> 00:07:21,850
Bring in the box.

104
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,483
Ooh, this is fancy.

105
00:07:29,114 --> 00:07:30,616
I hope this ain't lunch.

106
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,295
This time, Ms. Simmons...

107
00:07:33,385 --> 00:07:36,366
we have a very appropriate
sentence for you.

108
00:07:36,455 --> 00:07:37,729
What's this?

109
00:07:37,823 --> 00:07:39,825
You gonna put me on house arrest again?

110
00:07:39,925 --> 00:07:41,768
Oh, no, Your Honor. Go easy on me.

111
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,931
That's more like my punishment.

112
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:47,841
You need to learn to be an example
to the neighborhood.

113
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,844
What? You cannot be serious.

114
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:51,437
That's hovv come
I chased these children-

115
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:53,346
to teach them to
take care of their neighborhood.

116
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,679
Judge, you crazy.

117
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:57,253
Ms. Simmons, you wrecked
a whole city block!

118
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,516
Does that sound like
taking care of your neighborhood?

119
00:07:59,611 --> 00:08:02,922
Well, if the city had been a better block,
then the block vvouldrft have got ruined...

120
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,689
and I vvouldrft be up in here
with your blockhead, Judge.

121
00:08:05,784 --> 00:08:08,390
It's time you learned to
do things the right Way.

122
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:11,366
I do things the right Way.
I do 'em the left Way too.

123
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,327
<i>You bad, Medea.</i>

124
00:08:14,426 --> 00:08:16,064
That's why you're here, Ms. Simmons.

125
00:08:16,161 --> 00:08:19,233
I'm gonna teach you
hovv to do good in a good Way.

126
00:08:19,331 --> 00:08:20,401
Why? ls Santa watching?

127
00:08:20,499 --> 00:08:23,241
- Do you Want to do good for this community?
- Yes, sir.

128
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,143
Wonderful.

129
00:08:26,238 --> 00:08:28,809
Then you can start tomorrow
by guiding the young souls...

130
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:30,818
at the Moms Mabley Youth Center.

131
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:34,152
Oh, shoot, you vvant me to whip some punks
into shape? I can do that all day long.

132
00:08:34,246 --> 00:08:38,820
I can do that right now. Where they at?
Please bring them to me. Please.

133
00:08:38,917 --> 00:08:41,921
No, Ms. Simmons,
I Want you to make a difference...

134
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,830
Without making a mess.

135
00:08:43,922 --> 00:08:46,903
- Make a difference Without making a mess?
- Court dismissed.

136
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,504
Well, this does not bode well with me.

137
00:08:52,264 --> 00:08:55,370
That stupid judge. If he thinks I'm actually
going through vvith this, he must be crazy.

138
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,208
Everybody up in here crazy except me.

139
00:08:57,302 --> 00:09:01,478
Now, Maclea,
you have to clo as the law says.

140
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:02,779
- Say who'?
- The law.

141
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,412
The law'? Girl, I am the law.

142
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:07,889
Get over there.
Now, right now. Do it.

143
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,187
I do What I vvant.
Mind your business.

144

I gotta go shoppin'.

145
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,867
Oh, this ain't good!

146
00:09:23,695 --> 00:09:25,197
Oh, I'm possessed!

147
00:09:27,866 --> 00:09:29,777
My hips airft meant to do that!

148
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,688
<i>Did / forget to mention my little escape clause?</i>

149
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:41,724
You sneaky little frog-lookirf-toad.

150
00:09:41,814 --> 00:09:45,489
<i>If you attempt to avoid

00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:49,121
Wow. Would you look at that.
Taking me back to the old days.

168
00:10:49,214 --> 00:10:50,955
I was so sweet and innocent.

Excuse me, young man.

00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:59,097
Getting lunch, stupid.

171
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,264
You forgot your lunch.

172
00:11:07,032 --> 00:11:08,602
That was something.

173
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,408
I gave my first black eye
right over there.

174
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:15,076
Such fond memories.
Where does the time go?

175
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:18,121
Novv time to set these kids straight,
Madea style.

176
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,746
And be outta here by lunch.

177
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,507

178
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,301

00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,269
That old lady! Attack!

180
00:12:22,641 --> 00:12:24,780

00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:15,269
Just take your cankle jewelry

of such an amazing group of people!

236
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:40,247
As mayor of Atlanta,

Oh, puh-leese.

248
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:21,114
People are so stupid.

249
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,285
If they actually stopped
to think for a minute, they'd revolt.

250
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:25,918
Well, let's hope they clon't...

251
00:16:26,017 --> 00:16:28,691
because Mayor Thomas
is picking up steam in the polls.

252
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:31,131
And What are vve doing about it?

253

Well, we've got some
new billboards going up.

00:16:34,426 --> 00:16:37,839
Oh, and we've ordered an attachment so the
launcher can launch puppies and kittens.

255
00:16:38,697 --> 00:16:40,540
You are such a small thinker.

256
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:46,173
It's time. We have to give the people
What they Want <i>now!</i>

257
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:48,581
<i>Or what they think they want.</i>

258
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:51,118
I've done it before, my friend.

259
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,689
Novv is the time to do it again.

260
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:58,090
Wait. You were gonna Wait until you got
into office when no one could challenge you.

261
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,187
Well, it looks like
I have to change my plan.

262
00:17:01,286 --> 00:17:04,358
My partner is getting
a little antsy anyway.

263
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:05,992
Your p-partner?

264
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:08,367
Too many questions.
But dorft worry.

265
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,168
This will put me over the edge.

266
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:14,572
My partner will see to it that it does.

267
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:20,207
Gentlemen, we are going
to fix the broken heart of this town-

268
00:17:20,305 --> 00:17:22,478
Freedom Park.

269
00:17:39,624 --> 00:17:41,103
I forgot my purse.

00:17:43,795 --> 00:17:45,399

00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,445
I oughta sentence him to three-to-five
years of my foot alongside of his head.

273
00:17:51,002 --> 00:17:52,310
Shut up. Shut up.

274
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,247
D, leave that be.

275
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,785

Calm clown, little girl.
Y'all ain't gettin' me rilecl up again.

282
00:18:13,858 --> 00:18:16,805

283
00:18:16,895 --> 00:18:19,136
- Let's go.

284
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,335
Well, I could use a snack.

285
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,743
Oh, I guess you

286
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,974
Now come on, y'all.

00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:27,573
Shut your eyes, D.

288

Uh, children?

289
00:18:36,247 --> 00:18:38,557
Oh, okay, fine.

290
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:40,027

00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,495
Sit there and hush.

298
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,466
Mabel, I don't even know
if I wanna eat your cooking.

299
00:19:19,557 --> 00:19:21,935
Keep it up.
You might end up choking on this bacon.

300
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,371
'Cause every time I eat it,
I start to itch.

301
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:34,075
Okay, I need my oxygen.

302
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,714

a proper home...

304
00:19:43,014 --> 00:19:44,493
just like you asked me to.

305
00:19:44,582 --> 00:19:48,496
- Mm-hmm.
- But then... something happened.

306
00:20:05,103 --> 00:20:07,014
<i>And I just said to myself...</i>

307
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:10,416
<i>“Self, what would the man upstairs
do in this situation?“</i>

308
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:13,421
<i>And I just couldn't leave
that poor, helpless dog.</i>

309
00:20:13,511 --> 00:20:15,752
Barn, stop sitting there lyin'.
Tell the truth.

310
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,589
- You forgot to go to Child Welfare.
- I mighfve.

311
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:21,323

00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:26,291
<i>We gem' somewhere?</i>

315
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,167

<i>Now, Medea, stay cook.</i>

317

Little girl, look here.
I know you're tough and I respect that.

318
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,175
But y'all kids need some nourishment.

320
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,890

<i>Whom-hoe, she a has“; one.

328
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:18,319
I'm about to be feisty on your face,
you raggedy old tick.

329
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,786
It's filthy in here.

330
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:26,454
You know, it ain't like you
to get the authorities involved.

331
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,622
Look here, Barn.
Them children need a home.

332
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,030
Now get clown to that welfare office.

Get them children somewhere to stay.

335
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,809
Now that's more like you.

336
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:49,315
Well, your suspensions shot.
You've been taking bumps too fast.

337
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,648
But I haverft. I swear.

338
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,250
That's tight.

339
00:22:06,691 --> 00:22:09,638
I carft believe y'all slept
at the old lady's house last night.

340
00:22:09,727 --> 00:22:11,229
Yeah. l-low freaky was that'?

341
00:22:11,329 --> 00:22:14,606
Did she try to eat you?
I bet she tried to eat you.

342
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:16,201
It was a'ight.

343
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,976
Somebody let you ihto her home
and you thank her by walking out oh her?

344
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,108
Man, I told you vve dorft need you here.

345
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,848
Oh, that's right.
You dorft need help from nobody.

346
00:22:25,944 --> 00:22:27,321
How's that vvorkin' out for you?

347
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,982
That's What I thought.

348
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:33,858
Honey, you go around
mad at the world all your life...

349
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,761
the world airft gonna care about you.

350
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,801
The world already doesrft care
about me, about nobody.

351
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,996
You right for the most part, honey.
Most times the world dorft care.

352
00:22:42,093 --> 00:22:43,766
But there are lots of people that <i>0'0...</i>

353
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,604
and you have to recognize
when somebody really cares.

354
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:48,371
Do you understand, little girl?

355
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,539
Boy, What you do- Gimme this ball.

356
00:22:53,104 --> 00:22:56,085
Novv, if you gonna dribble, do it right.
You see that?

357
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,379
Barn.

358
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:05,283
Do it right.

359
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,103
And that's why vve need
to restore Freedom Park...

360
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:26,273
and the Moms Mabley Youth Center.

361
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,646
What in the hello is this?

362
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,984
Betsy Holiday for mayor.

363
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,690
And I'm Madea...

364
00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:39,989
for get out of my gym.

365
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:51,629
Now, Maclea, I assure you,
I will not get the heck out of your gym...

366
00:23:51,729 --> 00:23:55,006
until I have saved
the Moms Mabley Youth Center.

367
00:23:57,368 --> 00:24:00,781
Save? What you mean save?

368
00:24:00,872 --> 00:24:04,081
I'm going to make sure
that you children...

369
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:06,712
and all the other children
in this neighborhood...

370
00:24:06,811 --> 00:24:09,291
have a new, safe place to play...

371
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:11,792
for many, many, many years to come.

372
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:15,929
Can we have those smoothie robot
vending machines?

373
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,226
And wheelchair ramps?

374
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:20,997
And smoothie robot vending-
Oh, vvait.

375
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,868
<i>So, we dent need
the pnze money anymore'?</i>

376
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:29,378
No, my dear.
Betsy is going to take care of everything.

377
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,346
Now look here, Hairdo, or l-lair-clon't,
whatever that is on you-

378
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:35,714
What is that on your head'?
ls something living- Excuse me.

379
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,151
From What I've seen,
when somebody walks in your door...

380
00:24:38,242 --> 00:24:42,054
saying they're gonna fix all your problems,
they're usually up to somethin'.

381
00:24:42,146 --> 00:24:44,148
Isn't that right'?

382
00:24:44,248 --> 00:24:46,819
This place needs a helping hand.

383
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:48,693
That's Where I come in.

384
00:24:48,786 --> 00:24:51,027
Girl, get outta here. Dorft act like
you know What this place needs.

385
00:24:51,122 --> 00:24:53,261
You airft from around here.
You didn't grow up here.

386
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,736
You didn't give nobody a black eye
in that corner. I did.

387
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,104
- You dorft know What you're talking about.
- I'll tell you What I'm not.

388
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:00,676
A criminal.

389
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,308
This communityé
been burned by Mayor Thomas...

390
00:25:06,404 --> 00:25:09,510
but I assure you under Mayor Holiday-

391
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,249
things will be different.

392
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:16,018
Just take a look at What I've done
to Chastain Park.

393
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,651
Now, now, if you can follow me outside...

394
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,754
we can start the cleanup process.

395
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:32,007
As mayor, I'll do vvhafs necessary...

396
00:25:32,096 --> 00:25:33,700
to clean up these streets.

397
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,779
And we'll do it by recycling!

398
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:54,088
Children, vve goin' for a ride.

399
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:03,897
I Want you to see something.
Welcome to the beautiful Chastain Park.

400
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,015
Welcome to Chastain Park.

401
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:18,746
Perp alert. Perp alert.

402
00:26:18,843 --> 00:26:22,154
- This place is tight.
- For reals.

403
00:26:22,246 --> 00:26:25,318
- Dang.
- We could sleep here and no one would notice.

404
00:26:26,417 --> 00:26:28,397
Look at all these wheelchair ramps!

405
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:30,932
This must be What heaven is like
if God was in a wheelchair.

406
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:33,525
But I guess He vvouldrft be. He's God.

407
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:36,833
I mean, if he got in an accident,
he could just fix himself.

408
00:26:37,361 --> 00:26:39,341
Focus, young man.

409
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,273
Y'all see a park anywhere?

410
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:42,844
What about that little patch of grass?

411
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:48,106
Man, there used to be
some sick courts over here.

412
00:26:48,206 --> 00:26:50,948
This looks less like Chastain Park...

413
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:53,113
and more like Chastain Park-ing Lot.

414
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,851
Y'all gonna call me out
on myjoke like that?

415
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,360
Okay, fine. But that was funny.
I tickle myself.

416
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:08,363
Help!

417
00:27:12,763 --> 00:27:14,470
Come on, Dang Dang, come on.

418
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:18,742
Ooh, that Betsy Holiday.
She wants to do this to Freedom Park.

419
00:27:18,836 --> 00:27:20,247
I dorft know who she thinks she's helping.

420
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:22,716
- Whatever happened to community?
- It's right there.

421
00:27:24,242 --> 00:27:27,382
- Not that kind of community. Real community.
- It's right there.

422
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:30,954
Boy, I ain't talkin' about no store.

423
00:27:31,048 --> 00:27:33,494
I'm talking about community.

424
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:37,327
If that Holiday “restores” Freedom Park...

425
00:27:37,421 --> 00:27:40,766
vve can say good-bye to our youth center
and to our community.

426
00:27:40,858 --> 00:27:44,237
There vvorft be nothin' but fancy stores.

427
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:47,502
I think I'm gonna pay
Miss Betsy a little visit.

428
00:27:47,598 --> 00:27:50,841
Ooh. Ominous.

429
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,246
Y'all ladies need some help stretchin'?

430
00:27:56,908 --> 00:27:58,012
Hey!

431
00:28:08,686 --> 00:28:11,360
This gon' have to be quick.

432
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:17,600
And the last piece of the puzzle
is the Moms Mabley Youth Center.

433
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:26,407
Our polling shows that this community
is favoring your new initiative.

434
00:28:27,004 --> 00:28:28,074
Perfect.

435
00:28:36,681 --> 00:28:39,958
So if you secure the park,
you'll secure the mayofis office.

436
00:28:46,657 --> 00:28:48,068
Hello.

437
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,565
Madea, please come in before you freeze.

438
00:28:53,664 --> 00:28:58,170
Zip it, lippit. Betsy, I took a little
trip clown to Chastain Park today.

439
00:28:58,269 --> 00:29:00,977
Or should I say Chastain Park-mg Lot'?

440
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:05,077
I knew y'all were gonna laugh.
I like him.

441
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:07,713
I know you mean to tear clown
Freedom Park.

442
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:11,750
Will you excuse us for a moment?

443
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:13,522
All right, Madea.

444
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,565
I've had about all I can take from you.

445
00:29:17,755 --> 00:29:19,701
Girl, you ugly when you mad.

446
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:25,001
<i>Oh, you cam stop Ms, Medea.</i>

447
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:28,600
It's what the people want.
it's what the voters want.

448
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:31,805
In two Weeks, that park will be mine.

449
00:29:31,902 --> 00:29:33,677
Oh, really? Okay, Betsy.

450
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:35,808
VVell, I think this $251100 prize...

451
00:29:35,906 --> 00:29:38,409
will be enough to pay for those building
improvements you were talking about.

452
00:29:38,509 --> 00:29:41,922
- What you think?
- Those kids dorft stand a chance.

453
00:29:42,013 --> 00:29:45,358
I've created my own team,
just to make sure.

454
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,929
Girl, What crazy you talkin' about?

455
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:50,727
The Chastain Park Players.

456
00:29:50,821 --> 00:29:52,198
Super athletes, you know.

457
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,134
Please, we could take on
those robots any clay.

458
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,797
If you dorft stay out of my way...

459
00:29:57,895 --> 00:29:59,340
I'm gonna bury you.

460
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,639
Oh, look here.
Betsy got some street in her, I see.

461
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,540
Oh, no, I do not.

462
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,546
Oh, looks like your ride is here.

463
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,313
You're gonna have to come with us.

464
00:30:11,409 --> 00:30:14,879
No, you don't understand.
That Woman is gonna tear dovvn the center.

465
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,983
That woman?
You mean the future mayor of this city?

466
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:21,724
- Let's go.
- Come on, Madea.

467
00:30:21,819 --> 00:30:24,561

468
00:30:24,655 --> 00:30:26,965

00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,971

00:30:49,146 --> 00:30:51,854
- There ya go.
- Thanks, man.

472
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,501
That lady's gonna tear this place dovvn.

473
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:08,304
Yeah, and build stores
that only sell batteries.

474
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,401
That's a vvack business model, yo.

475
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:12,845
Wait- What the heck is going on?

476

You mean <i>when</i> it gets shutdown.

482
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:30,996
No, it's not when it gets shut clown.

00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:34,659
and get this building up to code.

485
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:37,137
Do you understand? You can do it.

486
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:39,572
Ankle bracelet lady
might be on to something, y'all.

487
00:31:41,165 --> 00:31:43,270
We're just gonna lose.

488
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,414
Son, if you dorft try,
you've already lost.

489
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:49,917
Yeah, that's What I'm saying.

00:31:50,007 --> 00:31:52,920
Listen, if you try your hardest
and do your absolute best...

491
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:56,253
I guarantee you will save this place,
but you're gonna have to work hard.

492
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,226
My juice box has a guarantee.

493
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:01,421
Oh, no, this is a better guarantee, honey.

494
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:04,591
This is a Madea guarantee.
You can take that to the bank.

495
00:32:04,688 --> 00:32:06,725
That means something.
You better ask some people.

496
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:09,828
Now who's with me'?
Come on, who with me'?

499
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:21,013
Okay, you know What?
You're delusional, man.

500
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,813
I'm delusional?
No, <i>you're</i> delusional, my friend.

501
00:32:23,908 --> 00:32:23,940
Now, the key to winning is- loam.

502
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:26,251
Now, the key to winning is- loam.

503
00:32:29,513 --> 00:32:31,925
- Mabel, that spells “pee.”
- Thank you, Joe.

504
00:32:33,617 --> 00:32:35,961
- Like urination.
- We got it, Joe.

505
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:37,964
I'm sorry about my brother.

506
00:32:38,055 --> 00:32:40,729
He's just What I call an “eye-diet.”

507
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:46,772
All right, now, as you know, the game
has four competitions-

508
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:49,845
the 'IOU-meter race,
three-on-three basketball...

509
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:54,076

competition, capture the flag, okay?

510
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,762

511
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,305
Barn.

512
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,488
We're just training, Officer.

513
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,995
Now, go on. I clon't want you
to see a lady lookin' like this.

514
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:46,660
- She thinks I'm hot.
- You're hot? You're- No, I'm hot!

515
00:34:10,014 --> 00:34:11,516
Oh, yes!

516
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,725
I dorft know if this is legal, Madea.

517
00:34:14,818 --> 00:34:18,265
Look here, it aih't legal for them
to smell this bad either.

518
00:34:18,822 --> 00:34:19,960
Watch out.

519
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:24,197
Sorry.

520
00:34:27,197 --> 00:34:29,074
Act like we statues.

521
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,981
You mess with us, we mess with you.

522
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:39,918
Y'all carft touch the Mabley crew.
Come on.

523
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:41,819
You mess with us, we mess with you.

524
00:34:41,912 --> 00:34:44,085
Y'all carft touch the Mabley crew.

525
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:45,819
You mess with us, we mess with you.

526
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:48,192
Y'all carft touch the Mabley crew.

527
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,426
L-low cute.

528
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:54,696
They're actually
going to try and save this dump.

529
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:59,104
You are going to put a stop to this,
and fast.

530
00:34:59,196 --> 00:35:02,439
Oh, not to worry, sir.
I-I'll think of something.

531
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,841
You better!

532
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:08,110
If I dorft get my mall,
you dorft get to be mayor.

533
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:13,951
And I'll kick you back out onto
the streets Where I found you.

534
00:35:14,044 --> 00:35:17,116
Do you remember that, Betsy-vvetsy?

535
00:35:17,881 --> 00:35:20,623
No, please dorft, sir.

536
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:22,459
Please.

537
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,193
Remember, Betsy-vvetsy.

538
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,331
I built you.

539
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,369
And I can break you.

540
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,534
Have I made myself clear?

541
00:35:48,078 --> 00:35:50,752
Good, Chris.
You're actually starting to make some.

542
00:35:50,848 --> 00:35:53,454
And, Lacey, you're scary. That's good.

543
00:35:55,252 --> 00:35:57,163
<i>Medea, Medea, Medea!</i>

544
00:35:57,254 --> 00:35:58,995
I finally got in touch
with Social Services.

545
00:35:59,089 --> 00:36:02,229
They're gonna come by your house tonight
and meet the children.

546
00:36:02,826 --> 00:36:06,239
Oh, oh, I clicln't realize
you were going clown there already.

547
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,707
I mean-

548
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:10,278
I whupped their butts.

549
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:13,314
Avoided the bureaucracy,
just like you told me to.

550
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,912
Come on, D.

551
00:36:16,006 --> 00:36:18,008
But I thought we were going back
to Macleafs house.

552
00:36:18,108 --> 00:36:20,520
What, so vve can let her
hand us over to the state?

553
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:23,820
Navv, I'm not letting her split us up.
Let's go.

554
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:39,597
Oh, they'll be here soon.
They probably got stuck at the library.

555
00:36:51,909 --> 00:36:54,856
D, look at these shoes.

556
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:59,590
We need a sugar mama.

557
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:07,127
I promise you I'm gonna find you
someplace safe to sleep soon.

558
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:09,465
I'm gonna find you a real home.

559
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:25,876
D!

560
00:37:30,214 --> 00:37:31,284
Hey!

561
00:37:47,264 --> 00:37:49,210
Dang Dang!

562
00:37:56,707 --> 00:37:58,186
Grab my hand!

563
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,789
No!

564
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:26,939
On your mark.

565
00:38:28,438 --> 00:38:29,678
Get set.

566
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:33,917
Joe!

567
00:38:39,716 --> 00:38:42,356
- Where did y'all sleep last night?
- Why do you care?

568
00:38:42,452 --> 00:38:45,956
We received an anonymous tip
that they were sleeping at the park.

569
00:38:47,724 --> 00:38:49,635
Little girl, I was Worried sick.

570
00:38:49,726 --> 00:38:52,536
- We looked everywhere for y'all.
- Apparently not.

571
00:38:52,629 --> 00:38:56,236
Okay, that is it.
I have held back for as long as I could.

572
00:38:56,333 --> 00:39:00,145
What you need is a good old spankin' from
back in the day. Come here. Come here, girl.

573
00:39:00,237 --> 00:39:03,480
Oh, girl, girl. You gonna get it now.

574
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:05,611
- Put me down!
- Let go of my sister!

575
00:39:05,709 --> 00:39:08,485
- Hey! Hey!
- Ow! Ow!

576
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:10,886
Yeah, give it to her good!

577
00:39:10,981 --> 00:39:13,621
Ms. Simmons, What are you doing?

578
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:21,236
Children, cover your eyes.

579
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:23,396
No, I wanna see this.

580
00:39:23,493 --> 00:39:27,908
I know you ain't show up on my turf again.
You ain't gonna nun these kids.

581
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,543
Oh, Madea, so colorful.

582
00:39:30,634 --> 00:39:33,444
But I'm here on a mission of love.

583
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:39,815
You know,
when I was here the other clay...

584
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:44,256
I was particularly inspired
by two of your children.

585
00:39:44,348 --> 00:39:48,797
There's nothing
that breaks my heart more...

586
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,799
than seeing children Without a home.

587
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,495
That's why I'm going to adopt
little Delinquinetta here...

588
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,764
and her brother Dang Dang.

589
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,203
What?

590
00:40:01,164 --> 00:40:05,635
And from What I savv earlier,
it looks like I arrived just in time.

591
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,615
- Child abuse, Madea?
- Mm-hmm.

592
00:40:08,705 --> 00:40:10,582
“Mrs. Anonymous Tip,” huh?

593
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:14,451
You are just terrible, using these children
just to get your face on the TV-ision.

594
00:40:14,544 --> 00:40:16,285
You know, Ms. Simmons...

595
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,623
someones gotta keep these kids
from being split apart.

596
00:40:19,716 --> 00:40:21,127
So What does this mean?

597
00:40:21,218 --> 00:40:23,721
It means, dear, that you
and your little brother Dang Dang...

598
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,391
will finally have a suitable home.

599
00:40:27,891 --> 00:40:31,202
It is time to settle this the Madea Way.

600
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,639
Isn't that what got you in trouble
in the first place?

601
00:40:38,735 --> 00:40:40,476
I think you've just shown us all...

602
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:45,451
that these children are much better off
with a law-abiding caretaker.

603
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,156
Come here, dear.

604
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:52,625
I brought you some
“Welcome to the family” presents.

605
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:53,854
For you.

606
00:40:58,021 --> 00:40:59,694
Whoa! Dang!

607
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,170
Sugar mama.

608
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:05,968
And for you.

609
00:41:07,564 --> 00:41:09,805
These are for me?

610
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,107
Oh, go on, try them on.

611
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,616
That was the shoes conforming precisely...

612
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:21,189
to the shape of your foot.

613
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:23,121
Dang!

614
00:41:23,213 --> 00:41:26,786
Girl, take them ugly, gaudy shoes off.
We got to go practice. Come on.

615
00:41:26,883 --> 00:41:31,559
Netta, I know the thing you vvant
more than anything in the world...

616
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:35,296
is that your brother
have a safe place to live.

617
00:41:36,626 --> 00:41:40,267
Please, let me give you that place.

618
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,604
Honey, dorft you fall for that.

619
00:41:41,698 --> 00:41:44,008
What this Woman is offering you,
that is not a home.

620
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,547
- Trust me.
- And, What, you are?

621
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:48,673
You're just trying to get rid of us.

622
00:41:57,514 --> 00:41:59,323
All right, we'll come live with you.

623
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:00,724
Really?

624
00:42:02,452 --> 00:42:04,796
Oh, wonderful!

625
00:42:04,888 --> 00:42:07,198
Welcome to the family.

626
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:13,400
What about the rest of us?
What about the games?

627
00:42:13,497 --> 00:42:16,000
I am so sorry to say...

628
00:42:16,099 --> 00:42:20,605
Netta and Dang Dang vvorft be able to
compete with you in the games.

629
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,741
I'm so sorry, children.

630
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:25,513
- What about the center?
- We need you guys.

631
00:42:25,609 --> 00:42:27,088
Don't worry, children.

632
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:30,249
Mayor Betsy will take care of you.

633
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:33,521
I'm sorry, y'all, but we gotta look out
for our own, you know.

634
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,756
I thought we were your own.

635
00:42:35,852 --> 00:42:37,661
Do something, Madea!

636
00:42:37,754 --> 00:42:40,758
- Yeah, come on.

637
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:44,862
Well, ain't nothin' I say

638
00:42:44,961 --> 00:42:47,202
I got nothing in my purse to fix this.

639
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:50,870
Come along, children. Let's go home.

640
00:42:56,873 --> 00:42:58,580
L-low could you let this happen?

641
00:42:58,675 --> 00:43:01,212
Now there's no way we'll win the games
ancl save the center.

642
00:43:01,311 --> 00:43:04,121
Yeah. Dorft you care about
What happens to them, to the center?

643
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,423
Course I do.
But cryin' never fixed nothin'.

We just gotta get out there

650
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:27,076
Don't. You usually
just make things worse.

651
00:43:32,709 --> 00:43:35,986
Guess we're on our own
for the games tomorrow.

652
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:43,690
Whoa.

653
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:46,791

00:43:55,765 --> 00:43:58,712
Ooh, it looks terrible
even from here, doesrft it?

657
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,372
I dorft know. It looks a'ight.

658
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,074
Well, you shouldrft look back.

659
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:03,446
I never did.

660
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,248
You just need to embrace
the finer things in life.

661
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,050
Now, clon't bother me.

662
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:58,433
It's clear that you have
not learned your lesson, Ms. Simmons.

663
00:44:58,528 --> 00:45:01,702
You don't understand, Judge. I was
trying to help. I was trying to help her!

664
00:45:01,798 --> 00:45:05,007
By spanking her? Save it.
We've heard this before.

665
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:07,707
I dorft Want you anywhere
near those kids or the youth center.

666
00:45:07,804 --> 00:45:11,047
You'll fulfill the rest of your sentence
under house arrest.

667
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:12,211
No!

668
00:45:14,544 --> 00:45:16,785
I carft do no house arrest.

669
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,882
I have to be at the game.
Those kids need me.

670
00:45:19,649 --> 00:45:20,423
Court dismissed.

671
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:23,794
Yay! I did it! I did it!

672
00:45:26,323 --> 00:45:29,304
You know, I actually
believe her this time.

673
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:31,372
Me too.
And I'm the handsome one.

674
00:45:37,033 --> 00:45:42,039
<i>Once upon a t/me there was a wooden puppet
who didn't 0'0 as he was to/o'.</i>

675
00:45:42,138 --> 00:45:45,119
<i>He was a bad, bad puppet...</i>

676
00:45:45,208 --> 00:45:48,451
<i>so he never became real.</i>

677
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:50,889
<i>The end. Go to sleep!</i>

678
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:06,373
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

679
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:09,535
<i>welcome to the 17th annual
Youth Center Games!</i>

680
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:14,372

681
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:16,781

00:46:57,881 --> 00:47:01,522
Ooh, that judge. He made me so mad.

687
00:47:01,618 --> 00:47:04,292
Oh, he done gone rogue.
He got to be stopped.

688
00:47:04,387 --> 00:47:07,459
Think he could lock me up
in here with you.

689
00:47:11,561 --> 00:47:14,303
I made a promise to those children.

690
00:47:18,301 --> 00:47:20,178
F'.E.E.!

691
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,341
You need one of them adult diapers?

692
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:25,045

00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:31,482
<i>No, you dorm!</i>

695
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,704

Call Barn, Joe!
We gonna need a car!

699
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,692
I'm free, free at last!
Free at last!

700
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:11,891
Ooh, hoo-hoo.

701
00:48:13,523 --> 00:48:15,867
Well, this is cozy.

702
00:48:17,193 --> 00:48:17,226
As the brackets compete...

703
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,706
As the brackets compete...

704
00:48:18,795 --> 00:48:23,107
we'll see which two teams end up
in the final team competition...

705
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,042
capture the flag!

706
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,159
Ooh, look at her run!

707
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:54,971
And it will be the Chastain Park...

708
00:48:55,064 --> 00:48:58,671
versus the underdogs
at the Moms Mabley Youth Center.

709
00:48:58,768 --> 00:49:01,942
Wow! Who could've expected this?

710
00:49:12,916 --> 00:49:14,918
I cant believe she beat the bracelet.

711
00:49:24,694 --> 00:49:27,265
Wow. She's good.

712
00:49:35,205 --> 00:49:38,482
I'm sorry, Officer,
but I got some children to help.

713
00:49:38,575 --> 00:49:40,555
I'll see y'all in a bit.

714
00:49:48,084 --> 00:49:50,462
Hey, where'd she go?

715
00:49:52,255 --> 00:49:53,632
Ooh, this a nice tree.

716
00:49:53,723 --> 00:49:55,600
What is that, spruce?

717
00:49:55,692 --> 00:49:57,865
I believe that's pine.

718
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:01,238
Ooh, it smell good.
Smell like springtime in Paris.

719
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,867
Mississippi.

720
00:50:05,068 --> 00:50:06,741
I'm gonna lose my dentures!

721
00:50:12,275 --> 00:50:15,017
- Oh, no, Madea!
- You gon' kill us, woman.

722
00:50:21,584 --> 00:50:23,825
Would you two be quiet?

723
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,670
Oh, my-

724
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:33,672
What did you do to this car, Mabel?

725
00:50:35,331 --> 00:50:37,902
They just carft get enough
of me, can they?

726
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:43,581
You can't stop Maclea.
Maclea always fight back.

727
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:49,252
I'm gonna show those little ones
hovv to deal with their problems...

728
00:50:49,345 --> 00:50:52,417

729
00:50:52,515 --> 00:50:55,860
- Come on, Madea.
- Well, hello, good-lookin'.

730
00:50:55,952 --> 00:50:57,522
She was talking to me.

731
00:50:57,620 --> 00:50:59,327
Actually, I was talkin' to both of y'all.

732
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:02,266
I'm gonna show that Holiday woman
what the what's what.

733
00:51:02,358 --> 00:51:06,272
She tryin' to fix the game
so my kids carft save the youth center.

734
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:10,435
I told y'all, good-lookin',
I gotta help these kids, good-lookin'.

735
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:12,706
Are y'all gonna help me
or What, good-lookin'?

736
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,977
Whafd you have in mind?

737

I told you vve should
spend more time in church!

738
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:22,820
Do I have time to make my confession?

739
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,085
Let's go save the youth center,
good-lookin'!

740
00:51:27,917 --> 00:51:30,523
I airft never been on this side.
Feel good to be on the right side.

741
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,897
Wow! Let's do this, po-po!

742
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,432
In a few minutes,
the final competition begins...

743
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:42,840
and from the looks of it,
the Mabley kids dorft stand a chance...

744
00:51:42,932 --> 00:51:46,175
of winning that $25,000 prize.

745
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,620
- It's Madea.
- She came back.

746
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,454
Nah, she's just being
chased by the police again.

747
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:02,285
Maybe not.

748
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,524
Y'all ready to save our home?

749
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,032
She came back.

750
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,965
And she brought some friends.

751
00:52:09,258 --> 00:52:11,431
My friends drove all this Way
for a good show...

752
00:52:11,527 --> 00:52:13,768
and you gon' give it to 'em-
airft that right, kids?

753
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:15,501
You mess with us, we mess with you.

754
00:52:15,598 --> 00:52:17,202
Y'all carft touch the Mabley crew.

755
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,870
You mess with us, we mess with you.

756
00:52:18,968 --> 00:52:20,948
Y'all carft touch the Mabley crew.

757
00:52:23,439 --> 00:52:25,441
You crazy woman.

758
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,735
- Netta, What are you-
- Shh.

759
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:43,803
Whoa!

760
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:46,032
I think we 'bout to get a little help.

761
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:49,667
Excuse me, Netta, dear.
Where are you going?

762
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,439
Where we belong.

763
00:52:51,534 --> 00:52:52,979
This is yours.

764
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:56,175
By the way,
you're gonna owe a lot in texts.

765
00:52:56,272 --> 00:52:57,683
What is this?

766
00:52:57,774 --> 00:53:00,345
It appears as if two
of the Chastain teammates...

767
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,616
are switching over to the Mabley team.

768
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:03,713
Twist!

769
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:05,850
Welcome back.

770
00:53:05,948 --> 00:53:07,655
You carft do this to me!

771
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:09,787
Enjoy this beat-down, Betsy!

772
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,833
Enjoy this beat-down!

773
00:53:18,728 --> 00:53:20,207
Now go win this thing.

774
00:53:20,296 --> 00:53:22,139
Take your places. Take your places.

775
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:23,869
All right, folks, you know the rules.

776
00:53:23,966 --> 00:53:27,539
One member of the team must grab
the other team's flag Without being touched...

777
00:53:27,637 --> 00:53:29,878
and take it back to their side.

778
00:53:29,972 --> 00:53:32,009
First one to do this wins!

779
00:53:34,711 --> 00:53:36,782
Gross.

780
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:50,237
No mercy!

781
00:54:11,013 --> 00:54:12,424
Hey!

782
00:54:13,182 --> 00:54:15,594
Great teamwork.
That's my Mabley kids.

783
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:43,114
Get her!

784
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:47,523
I carft do this. There's no Way.

785
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,063
If you dorft try, you already lost.

786
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:00,035
No!

787
00:55:00,129 --> 00:55:02,200
<i>70 seconds on the clock.</i>

788
00:55:02,298 --> 00:55:04,209
- <i>IV/ne/ E/ghﬂ Seven!</i>
- Yeah, <i>go! That's it!</i> Right <i>there!</i>

789
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,712
<i>Six! Five! Four!</i>

790
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:10,216
<i>Three! Two! One!</i>

791
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:15,649
And the winners ofthe17th Annual
Youth Center Games...

792
00:55:15,745 --> 00:55:19,215
are the Chastain Park team!

793
00:55:19,315 --> 00:55:22,455
Yes! Go! Give 'em no mercy!

794
00:55:22,552 --> 00:55:23,826
Go, go, go!

795
00:55:33,262 --> 00:55:34,866
All right, Madea...

796
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:37,911
say good-bye to your Freedom Park and...

797
00:55:39,068 --> 00:55:41,014
your freedom.

798
00:55:41,103 --> 00:55:42,741
Something ain't right.

799
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:45,513
What's that?

800
00:55:45,608 --> 00:55:47,349
Hovv did that get on there?

801
00:55:50,246 --> 00:55:52,556
Well, look at this.
What do vve have here?

802
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:03,327
Well, ifs obvious vvhafs going on here.

803
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,741
I'm Betsy Holiday, beloved and-

804
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,002
Who wants a burger?

805
00:56:18,007 --> 00:56:19,418
Perp alert! Perp alert!

806
00:56:19,508 --> 00:56:20,680
Uh-Oh.

807
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:30,391
Dorftvvorry, Madea.
We'll get the kids' money.

808
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:33,695
No, no, no, I think
my expertise is needed.

809
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,840
Those ratty kids,
thinking they can stop me.

810
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,309
Me!

811
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,401
What the-

812
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:51,482
Me and my good-lookin' boys
are coming for you, Betsy!

813
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:53,247
No!

814
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,175
I knew you was from the hood!

815
00:57:24,273 --> 00:57:25,752
Well, so am I.

816
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,328
Girl, you better watch them turns.

817
00:58:28,604 --> 00:58:30,311
Look like your ride's here.

818
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:31,817
No!

819
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:39,850
I knew that added torque
would come in handy.

820
00:58:39,949 --> 00:58:42,691
Betsy Holiday, you're under arrest.

821
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,992
That-a-boy, good-lookin'.

822
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:49,103
This is What happens
when you try to run from who you are.

823
00:58:49,191 --> 00:58:54,072
I think she needs some good old-fashioned
“commun-tity” service.

824
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:56,302
L- I- I carft go back.

825
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:59,403
Don't make me go back
to that disgusting park.

826
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:03,040
I carft look back.

827
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:07,011
It's okay, sweetheart. Let it out.
Joe is here for ya.

828
00:59:08,277 --> 00:59:12,191
Let me ask you something. l-low you feel
about a man with an oxygen tank'?

829
00:59:13,482 --> 00:59:15,519
<i>Madam!</i>

830
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:20,133
The Moms Mabley Youth Center is saved!

831
00:59:33,369 --> 00:59:35,178
<i>Thank you, Medea.</i>

832
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:47,489

<i>We're gonna sing and shout

<i>Let's call and rejoice

840
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:14,778
<i>His love and mercy never will depart</i>

01:00:14,877 --> 01:00:18,017
<i>We're gonna raise the roof

842
