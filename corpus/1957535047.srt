2
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:38,388
There was a time
when there were no woods here.

3
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,663
Just a single tree.

4
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:44,234
But from one seed, an
entire forest can grow.

5
00:00:45,504 --> 00:00:47,538
Only here, the trees are not
alone.

6
00:00:50,242 --> 00:00:51,775
There are ghosts in the woods.

7
00:02:12,891 --> 00:02:14,718
It's okay, it's okay, it's
okay.

8
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,620
Come on, let's go.

9
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:25,569
"Nephew, I invite you Norfork.

10
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:29,366
It's a sanctuary for all in
these times.

11
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:32,769
We like to keep to ourselves.

12
00:02:32,811 --> 00:02:35,045
We have need of a doctor with
your skills.

13
00:02:36,582 --> 00:02:38,749
It is a place unlike
anything you've seen."

14
00:02:42,054 --> 00:02:44,548
You could have at least sent
along a map.

15
00:02:47,359 --> 00:02:48,292
Hey, Ruthy!

16
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:50,060
Ruthy!

17
00:03:49,722 --> 00:03:50,654
Evenin'.

18
00:03:54,393 --> 00:03:55,886
You with Joe?

19
00:03:55,928 --> 00:03:57,594
Uh, no.

20
00:03:59,598 --> 00:04:00,530
It's just me.

21
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,499
Hmm.

22
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,062
What the hell you doing out here

23
00:04:05,104 --> 00:04:06,603
in the middle ass nowhere?

24
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:12,069
Just, uh, just traveling
through.

25
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,003
Good.

26
00:04:13,045 --> 00:04:17,447
Then you don't mind if I sit
for a spell.

27
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:37,567
Micah.

28
00:04:39,638 --> 00:04:40,570
James.

29
00:04:48,147 --> 00:04:49,579
You make all this?

30
00:04:50,983 --> 00:04:52,642
You steal it?

31
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:55,819
I ain't a thief.

32
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,687
Yeah?

33
00:05:01,794 --> 00:05:02,726
Me neither.

34
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:23,847
Mighty kind of you, James.

35
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:33,890
I best be keeping on.

36
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,527
You ain't gonna stay
and keep me company?

37
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,834
Must be mighty nice for you,
huh?

38
00:05:45,671 --> 00:05:48,538
Now that you're free, you
get to go wherever you want.

39
00:05:49,508 --> 00:05:51,568
I didn't need a war to be
free.

40
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,542
Hmm.

41
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,143
What the hell is all this
anyways?

42
00:06:00,185 --> 00:06:01,211
I don't want any trouble.

43
00:06:01,253 --> 00:06:03,062
Yep?

44
00:06:03,104 --> 00:06:04,915
You best start talking about
them precious stones, boy.

45
00:06:04,957 --> 00:06:06,516
I don't know what you're
talking about, mister.

46
00:06:06,558 --> 00:06:11,628
The hell you don't.

47
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,658
I don't think I wanna hurt you,

48
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,460
but maybe I do.

49
00:06:16,502 --> 00:06:19,129
What happened to old
Joe, he got cold feet?

50
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,464
Where those precious stones?

51
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,499
I know you got 'em in here
somewhere.

52
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:06,142
Hello! Hello!

53
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:07,077
Hello!

54
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:08,979
Business in Norfork, traveler?

55
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,714
My name's James, James McCune,

56
00:07:10,756 --> 00:07:12,516
open, open the door!

57
00:07:16,862 --> 00:07:19,689
There's
something, something out there.

58
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:21,625
We've been waiting for you,
Mr. McCune.

59
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:24,127
Welcome to Norfork and such.

60
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:26,663
You can head on up to Mr.
McCune's place,

61
00:07:26,705 --> 00:07:29,172
that is, the other Mr. McCune.

62
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,543
Mr. McCune,

63
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:44,154
you'll find traveling by
day much more amicable.

64
00:08:02,341 --> 00:08:04,007
Evenin'.

65
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,722
Evenin', sir.

66
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,232
For the fire.

67
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,349
You all right, fella?

68
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:58,214
You look like most folks

69
00:09:58,256 --> 00:10:00,390
after they've had one of Torb's
specials.

70
00:10:02,294 --> 00:10:03,119
Beg your pardon, I just-

71
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:04,954
- Got to town.

72
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,756
Right, well pleased to meet you.

73
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:08,431
I'm Douglas Giuseppe Dubois.

74
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,200
James.

75
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,998
You know, we don't get many
newcomers here at Norfork.

76
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,273
In fact, before you, I was the
greenhorn.

77
00:10:20,212 --> 00:10:22,078
You catch a glimpse on your way
in?

78
00:10:24,349 --> 00:10:25,281
The ghosts.

79
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:28,111
I'm not sure.

80
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:31,287
No one ever is, it's
fascinating.

81
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:35,051
Come on, Torb.

82
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,053
You're gonna wanna see this.

83
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,388
Come on, come on!

84
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:41,291
Joe, once more and that's it.

85
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,066
But you pay up this time.

86
00:10:44,202 --> 00:10:45,335
I want my marks.

87
00:10:47,005 --> 00:10:48,498
You don't gotta worry
about that.

88
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,174
I'll be sending William over
to collect.

89
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,171
Darlin'.

90
00:11:04,489 --> 00:11:05,421
Stop.

91
00:11:13,231 --> 00:11:14,190
The bishop.

92
00:11:16,401 --> 00:11:17,801
Double of nothing, Joe?

93
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:20,764
Ah, incredible.

94
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:22,065
It's the echoes.

95
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,532
The what?

96
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,001
The sounds, the,

97
00:11:25,043 --> 00:11:26,269
it bounces off the bishop

98
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,005
and paints a picture in old
Torb's mind.

99
00:11:29,047 --> 00:11:31,523
He sees everything in here.

100
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:34,043
I guess you get to know a place
if you never step outside.

101
00:11:34,085 --> 00:11:35,979
Now listen, if you need
anything,

102
00:11:36,021 --> 00:11:38,014
I got a shop right near you.

103
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,065
You just come see me,

104
00:11:40,107 --> 00:11:42,118
and good heavens, man, bring
that hat along with you.

105
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,020
There's a cemetery nearby,

106
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:45,528
we'll give it a proper burial.

107
00:12:00,145 --> 00:12:02,205
You really do that with sound?

108
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:05,575
It's just a parlor trick.

109
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,544
Parlous trick or not, I,

110
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:09,979
I've never seen anything like
that.

111
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:10,954
Neither have I.

112
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:22,892
They real?

113
00:12:22,934 --> 00:12:24,567
The parlor tricks or the
ghosts?

114
00:12:27,439 --> 00:12:28,965
You want a drink?

115
00:12:29,007 --> 00:12:31,234
I reckon you need one.

116
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:32,208
Whisky, please.

117
00:12:37,182 --> 00:12:38,842
Got a mark card, lad?

118
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:40,250
Mark card?

119
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:44,113
I have minted silver and an
army bond.

120
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:46,322
Matthew already has you down
for credit.

121
00:12:48,526 --> 00:12:49,986
I'm getting the
distinct feeling

122
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:51,561
you all have been expecting me.

123
00:12:53,298 --> 00:12:55,124
Any newcomers in Norfork,

124
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:56,658
why, your name has been

125
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,233
on the tongues of these people
for weeks.

126
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:03,166
The hard part is sorting out
what's real.

127
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,634
Rumors are halfway round this
town

128
00:13:04,676 --> 00:13:06,643
before the truth can get its
boots on.

129
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,514
Jesse.

130
00:13:20,158 --> 00:13:21,918
You James?

131
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,419
Yes sir.

132
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:24,994
I heard you was in town.

133
00:13:26,064 --> 00:13:27,630
Matthew's been waiting on you.

134
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:30,326
Well, my uncle's directions

135
00:13:30,368 --> 00:13:32,061
weren't heavy on the specifics.

136
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:33,329
Wouldn't have told
you to come here first,

137
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:35,064
that's for damn sure.

138
00:13:35,106 --> 00:13:36,940
There's prettier places in town.

139
00:13:37,542 --> 00:13:39,168
And the smell,

140
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,977
reeks of death, come on.

141
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,052
Thank you for the drink.

142
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:52,522
That sign out front,

143
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:55,184
room for rent?

144
00:13:55,226 --> 00:13:57,287
It's yours if you want it.

145
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,122
Leave your carryings on the
table

146
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:01,664
and we'll set them in your room
for you.

147
00:14:03,668 --> 00:14:04,600
Appreciate it.

148
00:14:42,273 --> 00:14:43,206
Uncle.

149
00:14:45,643 --> 00:14:46,970
James.

150
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,177
My boy.

151
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,608
Your ma warned me

152
00:14:52,650 --> 00:14:54,978
that you would be more
handsome and talented than me

153
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,413
when you became a man.

154
00:14:57,455 --> 00:15:00,283
It seems she was right
on at least one account.

155
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:01,758
Uncle, I have to say,

156
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,227
this place is something else.

157
00:15:05,397 --> 00:15:08,658
James, I have to ask your
forgiveness.

158
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,093
I did not tell you the full
truth

159
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:12,228
of this place in the letter.

160
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:15,031
I wager that you would not
have believed me if I did.

161
00:15:15,073 --> 00:15:17,033
I reckon I wouldn't've.

162
00:15:17,075 --> 00:15:19,736
I haven't encountered this
kinda harmony up north.

163
00:15:19,778 --> 00:15:23,746
The lights and the gas,
it's something out of a,

164
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:28,311
out of a dream or Jules Verne.

165
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:31,187
Natural gas, mined right here
in town.

166
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:33,056
Not too bad, yeah?

167
00:15:34,626 --> 00:15:36,426
Pretty damn proud if I do say
so.

168
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:40,289
It's allowed me to do well for
myself.

169
00:15:40,331 --> 00:15:42,558
But it didn't just happen
overnight.

170
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,626
Many came and went.

171
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:48,604
Others, unable to accept,
but are still here.

172
00:15:50,108 --> 00:15:50,840
And I'm here.

173
00:15:52,277 --> 00:15:53,609
In an unfriendly land,

174
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,345
and I'm still right here.

175
00:16:01,319 --> 00:16:02,385
Staggering, hmm?

176
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:04,153
Sure is.

177
00:16:05,623 --> 00:16:08,051
It's downright outlandish.

178
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:08,825
People here,

179
00:16:10,462 --> 00:16:12,822
they don't care what you look
like, James.

180
00:16:12,864 --> 00:16:14,257
Not one bit.

181
00:16:14,299 --> 00:16:16,826
All that matters is purpose.

182
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:18,594
If you have value.

183
00:16:18,636 --> 00:16:19,861
Now, could you have ever dreamt

184
00:16:19,903 --> 00:16:21,169
of a notion like that out there?

185
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,366
Outside these walls?

186
00:16:23,408 --> 00:16:26,536
Outside, in the woods, I was
attacked.

187
00:16:26,578 --> 00:16:27,510
The ghosts.

188
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,512
Ghosts?

189
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:31,674
What are they?

190
00:16:31,716 --> 00:16:33,509
They can't be real.

191
00:16:33,551 --> 00:16:36,079
As real as anything I've ever
known.

192
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:38,281
Yet as magical as
anything I've ever dreamt.

193
00:16:41,559 --> 00:16:44,494
Breathing a red fog in ancient
hills.

194
00:16:46,331 --> 00:16:49,265
There's not a soul who has
not come in contact with them.

195
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:54,670
Most are wearing their
history in their scars.

196
00:16:57,575 --> 00:16:58,841
The ghosts are real, boy.

197
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:02,105
So are our walls.

198
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:04,790
So long as that's honored,

199
00:17:04,832 --> 00:17:07,477
each to his or her purpose,
we have harmony, balance.

200
00:17:07,519 --> 00:17:09,278
That's the wonder of this
place, James.

201
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,253
The rest,

202
00:17:12,223 --> 00:17:13,156
well, that's,

203
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:15,658
that's up to us to dream.

204
00:17:19,864 --> 00:17:21,824
You're a good person, James.

205
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:22,865
And a good doctor.

206
00:17:24,402 --> 00:17:26,863
And this town is full of good
people.

207
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:29,338
People who are gonna
be so grateful for you.

208
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:34,170
Plus, it was you or nobody, so.

209
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:40,910
Okay, Dr. McCune, on to
business.

210
00:17:40,952 --> 00:17:41,717
Well.

211
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,749
Hmm.

212
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,452
You always had a knack for
ingenuity.

213
00:17:49,494 --> 00:17:52,288
Necessity is the mother of
invention.

214
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,689
Isn't that what they say?

215
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,691
I always fancied Plato.

216
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,527
But philosophy's one thing,

217
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,896
action's a whole 'nother horse
entirely.

218
00:17:59,938 --> 00:18:01,864
Something I know a little bit
about.

219
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:02,838
Good.

220
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,601
We need you in tiptop shape.

221
00:18:05,643 --> 00:18:07,235
I'm sure you've seen the signs,

222
00:18:07,277 --> 00:18:08,871
Founders Festival, 25th
Anniversary.

223
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:09,912
Proud of that too.

224
00:18:11,482 --> 00:18:14,510
The whole town seems to be
more injury-prone than ever.

225
00:18:14,552 --> 00:18:17,720
Bunch of damn fools in masks
tripping over themselves.

226
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:21,284
You can head on down
to the clinic tomorrow.

227
00:18:21,326 --> 00:18:23,452
I'm sure you'll find it pretty
suitable.

228
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:25,621
Old doc left everything in
shape,

229
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:28,958
and I'll stop by soon to see
if you need anything else.

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,694
You can use my spare room for
tonight.

231
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,429
I already found board for the
evening,

232
00:18:33,471 --> 00:18:35,965
Torb, the blind barkeep,
he's fixing the room.

233
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,266
If I had known-

234
00:18:37,308 --> 00:18:38,608
- No, no, no, no trouble at all.

235
00:18:39,677 --> 00:18:42,478
You just make sure that your
mind is clear for tomorrow.

236
00:18:43,514 --> 00:18:44,747
You start your new life.

237
00:18:47,018 --> 00:18:49,552
Welcome to Norfork.

238
00:18:50,955 --> 00:18:53,689
Goodnight, uncle, and, er,

239
00:18:54,692 --> 00:18:55,851
thank you.

240
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:00,423
Oh, um,

241
00:19:00,465 --> 00:19:03,593
the old doc mixed some
medication for me.

242
00:19:03,635 --> 00:19:05,228
These old bones need a strong
concoction

243
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:06,662
to rest easy at night.

244
00:19:06,704 --> 00:19:08,004
Best remedy I've ever had.

245
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,606
If I can dig up that old recipe,

246
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:13,603
I'll be calling on you.

247
00:19:30,428 --> 00:19:33,829
Reckoned you could use a few
amenities.

248
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,726
And I can wash the miles outta
those,

249
00:19:36,768 --> 00:19:38,861
just leave 'em outside your
door.

250
00:19:38,903 --> 00:19:41,264
Now, you get some sleep, Dr.
McCune.

251
00:19:41,306 --> 00:19:43,739
Please, call me James.

252
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,042
Happily.

253
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:27,576
Why, the bear finally stirs.

254
00:20:27,618 --> 00:20:30,313
We were placing bets on
who was gonna rise first,

255
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:33,349
you or the moon, James.

256
00:20:33,391 --> 00:20:35,551
Didn't realize how tired I
was.

257
00:20:35,593 --> 00:20:37,520
You look brand new.

258
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:38,654
I feel brand new.

259
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:41,457
I'm making some lunch
for the boys at the mine,

260
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:42,732
do you want some?

261
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:46,429
This place just keeps getting
better.

262
00:20:46,471 --> 00:20:47,737
Go on, have a seat.

263
00:20:54,779 --> 00:20:55,711
Good morning.

264
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:03,419
Thank you.

265
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:11,854
Torb.

266
00:21:11,896 --> 00:21:12,828
Darlin'.

267
00:21:14,432 --> 00:21:16,692
How'd you make out this morning?

268
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,060
Four, plus the buck.

269
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:18,961
Atta' girl.

270
00:21:19,937 --> 00:21:22,138
Their bounty!

271
00:21:23,107 --> 00:21:24,540
Howdy, Miss Annie.

272
00:21:25,543 --> 00:21:27,570
Howdy, Mick, how's Emma?

273
00:21:27,612 --> 00:21:29,772
Oh, she's happy and smiling.

274
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,474
It's about to be her birthday,
you know.

275
00:21:31,516 --> 00:21:32,842
Already?

276
00:21:32,884 --> 00:21:34,710
That little girl's growing like
a weed.

277
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,786
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she sure is.

278
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:40,149
I actually wanted to ask if
y'all might do me a favor

279
00:21:40,191 --> 00:21:42,651
and get me something special
for her?

280
00:21:42,693 --> 00:21:43,619
How 'bout this?

281
00:21:43,661 --> 00:21:44,960
William's been practicing.

282
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:54,563
No, I was actually
thinking of maybe some pork?

283
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,604
She loves bacon.

284
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:58,801
Well, her loss, but yeah,

285
00:21:58,843 --> 00:22:00,569
we can take care of that for
you, Mick.

286
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:02,611
Oh, thank you both kindly.

287
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,758
Our pleasure.

288
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,611
Miss Annie, I
just, I don't have the words

289
00:22:08,653 --> 00:22:11,414
other than just thank you so
much.

290
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,516
You two should stay for a
drink.

291
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:15,000
'Fraid not.

292
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,485
One last run for us before it
gets dark.

293
00:22:16,527 --> 00:22:19,422
This town's eating like it's
getting ready to hibernate.

294
00:22:19,464 --> 00:22:21,023
Tomorrow then.

295
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:22,064
Tomorrow.

296
00:22:27,138 --> 00:22:28,070
Mick.

297
00:22:29,907 --> 00:22:33,002
You wanna take some of these
lunches down to the boys?

298
00:22:33,044 --> 00:22:34,009
Yes ma'am.

299
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:36,539
Reckon you can point James
there

300
00:22:36,581 --> 00:22:38,674
to the clinic on your way.

301
00:22:38,716 --> 00:22:41,610
Yeah boy, they're sure
gonna appreciate this.

302
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:44,547
You must be the new doctor, I'm
Mick.

303
00:22:44,589 --> 00:22:45,848
James.

304
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,450
I'll be happy to show you
around.

305
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:50,092
As long as it's in these
walls, I can get you there.

306
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:53,189
Let's get there.

307
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:56,959
Over there, you got your
stables and your woodcutter,

308
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,868
and there's schoolhouse.

309
00:23:00,037 --> 00:23:01,937
Course, my Emma, she
loves going to school.

310
00:23:03,074 --> 00:23:05,234
She is smarter than I am, man,
I swear.

311
00:23:05,276 --> 00:23:06,535
If you ain't gonna do your
duty,

312
00:23:06,577 --> 00:23:08,971
you don't deserve the job.

313
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,146
You can't be showing up here
hours late.

314
00:23:12,884 --> 00:23:14,917
Know your purpose, man.

315
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,653
Or do you not belong here?

316
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,750
No, no, I belong right here.

317
00:23:21,792 --> 00:23:22,725
Right here, sir.

318
00:23:24,595 --> 00:23:25,554
Morning, fellas.

319
00:23:25,596 --> 00:23:28,591
Just showing the new doc here
around town,

320
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:32,001
and lookie here, fresh lunch
from Torb's.

321
00:23:34,005 --> 00:23:35,898
Joe, right?

322
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,872
You feel okay?

323
00:23:38,576 --> 00:23:39,308
He's fine.

324
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,271
He just needs to get back to
work.

325
00:23:42,313 --> 00:23:44,173
I'll take him, boss,
get him back to work.

326
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,147
Come on, Joe.

327
00:23:53,691 --> 00:23:54,690
Morning to ya.

328
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:56,825
Morning.

329
00:23:57,962 --> 00:23:59,688
Hold on.

330
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:02,798
Ghosts got him.

331
00:24:03,935 --> 00:24:05,067
You knew him?

332
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,269
I didn't.

333
00:25:32,023 --> 00:25:34,123
I guess you're already making
house calls.

334
00:25:51,075 --> 00:25:55,204
Pardon me, I hear there
is need of a doctor.

335
00:25:55,246 --> 00:25:58,374
Well, hell, there you are,
Doc.

336
00:25:58,416 --> 00:26:00,909
I thought you's gon' make me
wait all day.

337
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:03,045
Sorry, I was busy unpacking.

338
00:26:03,087 --> 00:26:04,820
Didn't see your note right away.

339
00:26:07,858 --> 00:26:08,951
You must be Mrs. Roberts.

340
00:26:08,993 --> 00:26:10,152
Miss Roberts.

341
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,153
Miss.

342
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,156
Now, has the little one
come down with something?

343
00:26:14,198 --> 00:26:17,693
No, she just needs to
get her lines written.

344
00:26:17,735 --> 00:26:19,435
Okay, Emma, get.

345
00:26:20,838 --> 00:26:22,771
Go on out with the others and
play.

346
00:26:28,713 --> 00:26:31,840
Damn girl, don't know her place.

347
00:26:31,882 --> 00:26:34,376
I got a nasty burn from
the teapot last night,

348
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,311
you got anything to heal it,
Doc?

349
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:37,780
Of course.

350
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:40,015
And why don't I look
at that cough as well.

351
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,123
Oh, it won't help.

352
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:44,119
It's just the damn chalk.

353
00:26:44,161 --> 00:26:46,962
Last doctor tried but nothin'
ever took.

354
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:48,891
May I see your coat?

355
00:26:48,933 --> 00:26:50,265
Well, I suppose.

356
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:57,900
I see you're just like your
uncle.

357
00:26:57,942 --> 00:27:01,403
Always tinkering around
with all that metal.

358
00:27:01,445 --> 00:27:03,706
Yes ma'am, I suppose so.

359
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:05,340
Must be in the blood.

360
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,379
You trying to kill that thing?

361
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:13,322
You ruin that coat, and I'll
beat you to death with it.

362
00:27:14,391 --> 00:27:16,318
Uh, are you a gardener, Miss
Roberts?

363
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,787
Huh, not a good 'un.

364
00:27:18,829 --> 00:27:21,390
I tend to the few odd daisies
and petunias

365
00:27:21,432 --> 00:27:24,193
that show up uninvited on my
porch.

366
00:27:24,235 --> 00:27:25,167
May I?

367
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:29,498
Holy moly.

368
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:34,376
So how come you don't
have your daddy's name?

369
00:27:36,247 --> 00:27:39,014
Well ma'am, I never knew my
father.

370
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:42,660
Passed before I could,

371
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,353
and figure I don't need the
name of a stranger haunting me.

372
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:47,456
Won't do me no good.

373
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,352
Get rid of the useless,

374
00:27:50,394 --> 00:27:52,027
that's what I always say.

375
00:27:53,264 --> 00:27:55,357
Round here, we don't
care none

376
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,065
what you call yourself anyway.

377
00:27:58,435 --> 00:27:59,361
Here's a salve.

378
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:03,332
Apply three times a day and
keep it clean and covered.

379
00:28:03,374 --> 00:28:05,133
That it?

380
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:06,935
And try to avoid that
pollen.

381
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:07,969
Uh huh?

382
00:28:08,011 --> 00:28:09,004
Well, you ain't been coughing
up a lung

383
00:28:09,046 --> 00:28:11,039
since you took your coat off.

384
00:28:11,081 --> 00:28:13,175
Those daisies are rubbing off
on you.

385
00:28:13,217 --> 00:28:14,316
I'd bet you a nickel,

386
00:28:15,586 --> 00:28:17,246
a mark,

387
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:18,781
that's what's doing it.

388
00:28:18,823 --> 00:28:20,315
Holy hell, Doc.

389
00:28:20,357 --> 00:28:21,283
It's that simple.

390
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:23,184
Huh.

391
00:28:23,226 --> 00:28:25,087
I guess I shoulda put
two and two together.

392
00:28:25,129 --> 00:28:26,821
That's what I get

393
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:28,557
for trying to make those
useless things grow.

394
00:28:28,599 --> 00:28:30,265
Take care now, Miss Roberts.

395
00:28:32,102 --> 00:28:33,035
Hmm.

396
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,000
Sh.

397
00:29:57,054 --> 00:29:58,547
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.

398
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,581
Joe, you're all right, you're
all right.

399
00:29:59,623 --> 00:30:00,949
Can you hear me?

400
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:02,584
Joe, Joe, what happened?

401
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,552
Easy.

402
00:30:05,629 --> 00:30:06,622
Joe!

403
00:30:06,664 --> 00:30:07,656
Joe!

404
00:30:07,698 --> 00:30:08,630
Joe!

405
00:30:11,568 --> 00:30:13,035
Son of a bitch.

406
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:16,305
I need more hands.

407
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,282
Entre vous.

408
00:30:29,253 --> 00:30:31,647
Well, there he is, there he is.

409
00:30:31,689 --> 00:30:33,448
Howdy, Douglas.

410
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:35,090
Settlin' in? Feel like home?

411
00:30:35,726 --> 00:30:37,486
I'm working on it.

412
00:30:37,528 --> 00:30:38,921
Well, a man can't feel at home

413
00:30:38,963 --> 00:30:41,156
if he don't feel comfortable.

414
00:30:41,198 --> 00:30:43,191
You need a nice new coat.

415
00:30:43,233 --> 00:30:45,961
A man in a comfortable
coat is always home.

416
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:48,003
Look at that hat.

417
00:30:49,573 --> 00:30:51,273
Gimme a couple of days,

418
00:30:52,142 --> 00:30:54,369
I'll have it fitting you like a
glove.

419
00:30:54,411 --> 00:30:55,644
Perfect for a new start.

420
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:01,710
I've heard of these, but
I've never seen one before.

421
00:31:01,752 --> 00:31:04,619
Yeah, that's my girl, my
heart and soul.

422
00:31:06,256 --> 00:31:07,189
Please.

423
00:31:14,298 --> 00:31:16,999
The lens refracts the light
and burns the image in?

424
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:21,770
Yes sir, with the help of
a few chemicals and time.

425
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,534
How did you end up
here?

426
00:31:25,576 --> 00:31:28,737
I was down in New
Orleans, about to head west.

427
00:31:28,779 --> 00:31:32,274
Met Matthew on a riverboat,
took a liking to me.

428
00:31:32,316 --> 00:31:34,743
So this is my predecessor?

429
00:31:34,785 --> 00:31:37,386
Yeah, he was a real character.

430
00:31:38,455 --> 00:31:40,015
Why'd he leave?

431
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:43,085
It's a mystery, this
town is full of 'em.

432
00:31:43,127 --> 00:31:44,793
Really, it's what drew me to
stay.

433
00:31:45,629 --> 00:31:48,724
This town, they treat
these ghosts like they're

434
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,425
some kinda religion.

435
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:51,666
Ain't that the truth.

436
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:54,102
I'm gonna catch one.

437
00:31:55,072 --> 00:31:55,804
Catch one?

438
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,340
In a photograph.

439
00:32:00,611 --> 00:32:02,237
Can you imagine?

440
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:04,039
It would be fascinating.

441
00:32:04,081 --> 00:32:06,441
I don't know if I'd let
on about that little plan.

442
00:32:06,483 --> 00:32:08,143
I've been tinkering with it
for a while,

443
00:32:08,185 --> 00:32:11,046
I go up on the roof, I can
see just into the woods.

444
00:32:11,088 --> 00:32:15,584
I've caught the odd fire and
maybe a glow, but,

445
00:32:15,626 --> 00:32:17,692
I haven't got a shot of one yet.

446
00:32:18,562 --> 00:32:21,123
But I will, you know I will.

447
00:32:21,165 --> 00:32:23,241
You just be careful.

448
00:32:23,283 --> 00:32:25,360
You fall off that roof, you're
gonna end up in the clinic.

449
00:32:25,402 --> 00:32:28,063
I'm like a cat, always land
on my feet.

450
00:32:28,105 --> 00:32:29,664
Did someone keep the fires
burning

451
00:32:29,706 --> 00:32:32,474
over at the clinic after the
old doc left?

452
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:39,641
The hunters.

453
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:43,078
Yeah, Annie
kept the clinic going.

454
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,513
Any idea why she didn't stay
on?

455
00:32:44,555 --> 00:32:47,749
Well, with your arrival,
she got back in line.

456
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,551
They don't hunt, we don't eat.

457
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,526
You know where I can find
them?

458
00:32:54,531 --> 00:32:56,358
Just outside of town.

459
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:59,728
Haven't been myself, it being
outside the wall and all.

460
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,264
But I reckon shouldn't be far.

461
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:05,567
Just head west, past the
creek, should be a clearing.

462
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:09,104
Afternoon, just heading
out to see Annie and William,

463
00:33:09,146 --> 00:33:11,472
the hunters.

464
00:33:11,514 --> 00:33:13,842
Sorry, gate doesn't open
unless Matthew gives the word.

465
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:15,417
What?

466
00:33:19,156 --> 00:33:20,481
For your own good.

467
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:21,850
Look, Annie knows her
way around the clinic,

468
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:24,453
so if you wanna explain to my
uncle

469
00:33:24,495 --> 00:33:27,489
why you're preventing me
from fulfilling my purpose,

470
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,463
go right ahead.

471
00:33:32,336 --> 00:33:33,468
You come right back.

472
00:33:56,927 --> 00:33:59,354
You lost?

473
00:33:59,396 --> 00:34:02,531
I'm James, ma'am, James
McCune.

474
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,594
I know who you are, James
McCune.

475
00:34:05,636 --> 00:34:07,863
This whole town's been waiting
on you.

476
00:34:07,905 --> 00:34:09,498
Rumor has it you held down
the fort

477
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,133
when the last doctor slipped
away.

478
00:34:11,175 --> 00:34:12,868
Is that what happened?

479
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,509
He just slip away now?

480
00:34:15,913 --> 00:34:16,845
Ma'am?

481
00:34:18,582 --> 00:34:20,275
This place is just lucky
a plague didn't strike

482
00:34:20,317 --> 00:34:21,516
while I was in charge.

483
00:34:22,519 --> 00:34:24,319
You'd still be picking up
bodies.

484
00:34:25,589 --> 00:34:27,149
Look, I sure could use your
help around-

485
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:27,923
- Sh.

486
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,238
Mighty exciting out here, ain't
it?

487
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:45,907
Hello there.

488
00:34:51,448 --> 00:34:54,249
I'm James, James McCune.

489
00:34:56,253 --> 00:34:57,285
William, is it?

490
00:34:59,556 --> 00:35:01,550
Sorry, he don't talk much.

491
00:35:01,592 --> 00:35:02,591
That's all right.

492
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,894
I'd say most of us talk too
much anyways.

493
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:11,393
I came here to see if you might

494
00:35:11,435 --> 00:35:13,468
be up for helping me out at the
clinic.

495
00:35:14,771 --> 00:35:17,439
I don't reckon I'll be
taking up two jobs again.

496
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:19,941
I didn't mean nothing by it.

497
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:23,612
I'd have to leave the
hunting to little old William.

498
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:28,310
Well, I hear you know
you're way around the place.

499
00:35:28,352 --> 00:35:31,646
I need to know how to get
supplies.

500
00:35:31,688 --> 00:35:34,349
I'd welcome any insight
on the medical history

501
00:35:34,391 --> 00:35:36,251
of the folks around here.

502
00:35:36,293 --> 00:35:37,652
I see.

503
00:35:37,694 --> 00:35:40,622
You'd have a couple
of legs up on me, but,

504
00:35:40,664 --> 00:35:42,464
I could show you some skills
too.

505
00:35:43,533 --> 00:35:45,800
I'd have to give up
my fancy life out here.

506
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:52,701
Tell her I ain't gonna beg,

507
00:35:52,743 --> 00:35:54,803
but if she doesn't want the job,

508
00:35:54,845 --> 00:35:56,671
I've got an offer for you

509
00:35:56,713 --> 00:35:58,680

00:38:18,789 --> 00:38:19,614
Good morning.

541
00:38:19,656 --> 00:38:21,122
Good morning, uncle.

542
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,918
Welcome to my clinic.

543
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,153
Mm.

544
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:27,122
I got that recipe I mentioned.

545
00:38:27,164 --> 00:38:29,664
Do you think you have some
time to help your uncle out?

546
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,128
Yeah, looks like the
last doctor left behind

547
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,162
most of the ingredients,

548
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:36,865
but the supplies are lean here,

549
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:39,734
and the old doc didn't keep
a real detailed inventory.

550
00:38:39,776 --> 00:38:42,537
The man lost track of
damn near everything.

551
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:46,574
Boy, we needed a young mind
like yours in here for years.

552
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:48,009
Just make a list.

553
00:38:48,051 --> 00:38:50,478
Next time I head out to New
Orleans,

554
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,614
I'll make sure you're filled to
the brim.

555
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:54,816
It says here it needs
mushrooms,

556
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:56,551
don't see any in stock.

557
00:38:56,593 --> 00:38:59,554
Right, and those need to be
fresh.

558
00:38:59,596 --> 00:39:01,523
You're gonna have to dig
those up on your own.

559
00:39:01,565 --> 00:39:03,708
At least, that's what he did.

560
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,934
I suppose I can rustle
some up this afternoon.

561
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:08,863
Though, you gonna give
me permission to leave?

562
00:39:08,905 --> 00:39:10,698
Gatekeeper gave me a time at it
yesterday.

563
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,633
I know, I know.

564
00:39:11,675 --> 00:39:14,669
You probably think our rule's
strange.

565
00:39:14,711 --> 00:39:15,703
But you'll thank me.

566
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:17,354
I'll let him know that
you're free to leave

567
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,007
later this afternoon.

568
00:39:19,049 --> 00:39:20,742
Just don't linger.

569
00:39:20,784 --> 00:39:22,143
What cause did you have
to go out yesterday?

570
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:24,512
I went to meet Annie and
William.

571
00:39:24,554 --> 00:39:26,614
Hoping Annie could give me a
hand.

572
00:39:26,656 --> 00:39:28,950
Oh, no, that won't work.

573
00:39:28,992 --> 00:39:31,519
You got someone else who
knows their way around here?

574
00:39:31,561 --> 00:39:32,787
She knows her role.

575
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:34,656
She has her purpose.

576
00:39:34,698 --> 00:39:37,759
She held down the fort
after the old doc, right?

577
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:39,794
What happened here?

578
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:42,871
Heard an awful sound a few
nights ago.

579
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:47,569
I hauled to the gate and it was
unmanned.

580
00:39:47,611 --> 00:39:49,771
When I peeked out to the other
side of it,

581
00:39:49,813 --> 00:39:52,006
Joe came straight out of the
darkness.

582
00:39:52,048 --> 00:39:54,008
Kept trying to speak, but,

583
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,283
he didn't have a tongue.

584
00:39:57,287 --> 00:39:59,247
Why wasn't I told of this?

585
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:00,882
The gate was unmanned?

586
00:40:00,924 --> 00:40:02,584
And after dark?

587
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,696
Joe's been having a
tough time of it lately.

588
00:40:09,566 --> 00:40:11,259
We do our best to take
care of our own here.

589
00:40:11,301 --> 00:40:13,027
The ghosts' punishment is swift.

590
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:14,002
Ghosts?

591
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:17,165
That's what did that to him?

592
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:18,867
Mm.

593
00:40:18,909 --> 00:40:19,734
Why?

594
00:40:19,776 --> 00:40:20,708
How do I know?

595
00:40:21,645 --> 00:40:23,538
They're as inscrutable as God.

596
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,740
You find God inscrutable?

597
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:27,749
We've both seen the horrors
outside.

598
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:31,152
Slave markets in New Orleans.

599
00:40:32,255 --> 00:40:34,682
Children ripped from their
mothers.

600
00:40:34,724 --> 00:40:38,553
Slaves whipped to death,
Atlanta burned,

601
00:40:38,595 --> 00:40:40,662
and all God's will.

602
00:40:42,198 --> 00:40:44,866
And you would have me question
the ghosts

603
00:40:46,002 --> 00:40:49,037
who'd have us live within
these walls in harmony?

604
00:40:51,007 --> 00:40:54,175
I'll, uh, get to
working on that tincture.

605
00:40:56,613 --> 00:40:58,780
Yeah, uncle, I, er,

606
00:41:01,685 --> 00:41:04,045
I don't know, this
medicine is awful strong.

607
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:05,847
Oh, I'll water it down.

608
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:07,815
But this is more for pain.

609
00:41:07,857 --> 00:41:09,984
I can get you something
that's a better sleep aid.

610
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:12,120
I don't need nothing fancy,
James.

611
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:15,557
These bones are used to that
old crow medicine by now.

612
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,898
And I just like the option

613
00:41:17,968 --> 00:41:19,300
on those real tough nights.

614
00:41:23,673 --> 00:41:26,000
Look, if Annie decides
that she can help you out

615
00:41:26,042 --> 00:41:27,775
and perform her hunting duties,

616
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:30,878
I'll wager it wouldn't hurt.

617
00:41:32,082 --> 00:41:33,014
Thank you.

618
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,156
My uncle give you the go
ahead to let me go out?

619
00:42:22,198 --> 00:42:23,765
Yeah, yeah.

620
00:42:25,268 --> 00:42:26,200
And hey,

621
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,763
I was just patrolling the other
night,

622
00:42:28,805 --> 00:42:30,932
I didn't leave my post.

623
00:42:32,709 --> 00:42:35,109
I just want you to know that.

624
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:24,352
Joe?

625
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:18,105
Darling, you look like hell.

626
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:22,210
What possessed you to
wander out there at night?

627
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:25,413
It wasn't my intention
to be out at night.

628
00:45:27,517 --> 00:45:29,417
Gathering mushrooms for Matthew
and,

629
00:45:32,088 --> 00:45:33,020
I saw one.

630
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:36,090
It was, it was real,

631
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,492
and it was, it was hunting.

632
00:45:41,965 --> 00:45:43,264
These walls are haven.

633
00:46:38,988 --> 00:46:40,548
I didn't wanna insult
the man's tradition,

634
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:44,452
so I accompanied his
wife, his wife mind you,

635
00:46:44,494 --> 00:46:46,120
to the accommodations.

636
00:46:46,162 --> 00:46:48,589
I made every excuse in the
world.

637
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,364
Nothing happened there, but, er,

638
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:54,295
I do declare it was the best
night's sleep I'd ever had.

639
00:46:54,337 --> 00:46:56,330
Is that right?

640
00:46:56,372 --> 00:46:58,299
I apologize, Annie.

641
00:46:58,341 --> 00:47:00,001
The whole encounter was just-

642
00:47:00,043 --> 00:47:01,075
- Fascinating?

643
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:03,337
There he is.

644
00:47:03,379 --> 00:47:05,306
Exactly, James.

645
00:47:05,348 --> 00:47:07,682
Me and this man, we are
simpatico.

646
00:47:14,624 --> 00:47:16,017
Didn't realize I was keeping
you.

647
00:47:16,059 --> 00:47:17,151
Hello there, fellas.

648
00:47:17,193 --> 00:47:18,986
Just for a spell.

649
00:47:19,028 --> 00:47:20,388
Howdy, Douglas, how you
doing?

650
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,322
Lord, that man can
talk

651
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:22,924
a gate right off its hinges.

652
00:47:22,966 --> 00:47:23,698
Can I help you?

653
00:47:25,568 --> 00:47:28,562
As I remember, it was
you asking for my help.

654
00:47:28,604 --> 00:47:30,037
That was two days ago.

655
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:32,273
It sure was.

656
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,109
Good day, Mr. McCune.

657
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:38,039
Wait.

658
00:47:40,283 --> 00:47:41,175
I'm sorry.

659
00:47:41,217 --> 00:47:45,720
Had a rough night, and my
disposition is a little lacking.

660
00:47:47,190 --> 00:47:48,689
You mean you're being an ass?

661
00:47:49,726 --> 00:47:50,758
I'm being an ass.

662
00:47:52,662 --> 00:47:55,296
I would greatly appreciate
your assistance.

663
00:48:11,647 --> 00:48:13,748
Who messed all this up?

664
00:48:18,321 --> 00:48:19,780
This looks terrible.

665
00:48:19,822 --> 00:48:21,282
So, how long did you have to
triage

666
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:23,157
after the old doctor left?

667
00:48:24,260 --> 00:48:25,619
I remember Clyde coming in

668
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:30,157
with a sliced up leg in
September?

669
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,493
So six months or so.

670
00:48:32,535 --> 00:48:34,695
Winter kept everyone sick and
sniffling,

671
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:36,570
so I kept the lights on here.

672
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:40,808
Fewer incidents with the
ghost when the cold sets in.

673
00:48:41,711 --> 00:48:45,006
It's not for my stitching
ability, I can tell you that.

674
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:48,875
Annie!

675
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:50,444
Emma, darling,
what you do to yourself?

676
00:48:50,486 --> 00:48:52,079
Go on, tell her.

677
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:54,181
Yesterday I was flying my
kite,

678
00:48:54,223 --> 00:48:56,517
and a big gust of wind came and
took it

679
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,452
all the way to the top of a
tree.

680
00:48:58,494 --> 00:49:00,221
Did you take a fall?

681
00:49:00,263 --> 00:49:01,756
No, but I coulda climbed all
the way up,

682
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:03,523
I'm a good climber, but-

683
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,292
- She ain't supposed to be on
the other side of the wall.

684
00:49:05,334 --> 00:49:07,368
Lemme take a look at that,
Emma, hmm?

685
00:49:09,105 --> 00:49:11,472
Now, you let me know if
it starts to hurt, okay?

686
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:14,668
Ain't you supposed to be out
hunting?

687
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:15,636
You'd be surprised how much

688
00:49:15,678 --> 00:49:17,538
I can handle these days, Jesse.

689
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,579
I'm a big girl.

690
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:21,509
I'll tell you what.

691
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:23,444
We live outside the gate,

692
00:49:23,486 --> 00:49:25,719
and we ain't scared of nothin',

693
00:49:27,857 --> 00:49:29,316
not even ghosts.

694
00:49:29,358 --> 00:49:30,818
I bet my big old brother
could get your kite for ya.

695
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:33,661
That's mighty nice of you
and your big old brother.

696
00:49:35,431 --> 00:49:37,792
You know what's scarier than
ghosts?

697
00:49:37,834 --> 00:49:39,333
Tree trolls!

698
00:49:40,169 --> 00:49:41,502
You ever seen a tree troll?

699
00:49:42,638 --> 00:49:44,465
There's one right
there!

700
00:49:47,310 --> 00:49:48,676
Feeling better, darling?

701
00:49:49,712 --> 00:49:50,704
Yeah?

702
00:49:50,746 --> 00:49:51,839
Hmm?

703
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,706
It's good as new.

704
00:49:52,748 --> 00:49:55,643
But take it easy, okay?

705
00:49:55,685 --> 00:49:57,627
Don't want you climbing for a
while,

706
00:49:57,669 --> 00:49:59,613
and I don't want you writing
lines for at least a month.

707
00:49:59,655 --> 00:50:01,582
You tell Miss Roberts
that's doctor's orders.

708
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,250
How many marks?

709
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,726
Er, just half.

710
00:50:15,238 --> 00:50:16,564
Thank you, Dr. McCune.

711
00:50:16,606 --> 00:50:18,232
Thank you, Miss Annie.

712
00:50:18,274 --> 00:50:19,466
You're funny.

713
00:50:19,508 --> 00:50:20,701
Come on, it smells in
here.

714
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:23,370
Ow, Uncle Jesse, you're
hurting my arm.

715
00:50:23,412 --> 00:50:26,247
Every bone in that
man's body's a mean one.

716
00:50:34,023 --> 00:50:34,849
James, why did you tell Emma

717
00:50:34,891 --> 00:50:36,851
that she couldn't climb anymore?

718
00:50:36,893 --> 00:50:39,527
You know her arm's gonna
be fine in a day or two.

719
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:43,824
I'm not sure it's best for her

720
00:50:43,866 --> 00:50:46,467
to be indulging in tendencies
that

721
00:50:47,570 --> 00:50:48,729
take her outside the wall.

722
00:50:48,771 --> 00:50:51,572
Oh, now you too, huh?

723
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:54,168
I don't know what the ghosts
are,

724
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,504
but I know enough to respect
'em.

725
00:50:56,546 --> 00:50:58,205
Respect 'em?

726
00:50:58,247 --> 00:50:59,807
All they do is terrify these
people.

727
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:01,482
They should be terrified.

728
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:05,146
You're telling me after all
these years

729
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:07,348
living in those woods
you've never seen one?

730
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,322
Not once?

731
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:12,653
Yeah, Doc, we've seen 'em.

732
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:14,895
But I'll be dead before
I give 'em my fear.

733
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:20,768
William, you feel like hunting?

734
00:51:21,737 --> 00:51:23,737
Feel like we've done enough for
today.

735
00:52:02,678 --> 00:52:03,571
Leave her alone!

736
00:52:03,613 --> 00:52:04,605
Oh.

737
00:52:04,647 --> 00:52:05,813
Mick, I handled it.

738
00:52:06,616 --> 00:52:07,975
Doc, you can't sneak up on
people

739
00:52:08,017 --> 00:52:10,878
when they're killing a
pig for the second time.

740
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,248
I shot it in the woods,
it musta come back to life.

741
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,684
Anything I can do
to help?

742
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:17,658
Not now.

743
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:22,496
William.

744
00:53:16,852 --> 00:53:19,987
There you go, now pull up,
not out.

745
00:53:21,424 --> 00:53:22,690
And don't pull too tight.

746
00:53:27,596 --> 00:53:28,789
I'm used to slicing these up,

747
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,764
not trying to mend 'em back
together.

748
00:53:31,934 --> 00:53:33,901
Yeah, I need you to be good
at this.

749
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:47,715
You don't have to hide
anything, James, not from me.

750
00:53:50,786 --> 00:53:53,053
I just wanna do right
by this town, Annie.

751
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,861
How come William doesn't speak?

752
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:07,801
The last thing our daddy said
to him before he was killed

753
00:54:08,604 --> 00:54:09,770
was to be quiet.

754
00:54:11,774 --> 00:54:13,640
He hasn't spoken a word since.

755
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,289
Not to brag, Doc,

756
00:54:19,331 --> 00:54:21,115
but I believe you owe
me a drink for this one.

757
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,954
Are we looking at the same
stitching?

758
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:33,594
Hey, what's this?

759
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:38,665
Matthew's sleeping medication.

760
00:54:39,502 --> 00:54:41,762
It's actually pretty
complicated.

761
00:54:41,804 --> 00:54:43,771
If you ask me, a little
dangerous.

762
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:50,411
Looks like my daddy's
handwriting.

763
00:54:51,414 --> 00:54:54,141
Well, your dad must've
liked his drinks stout.

764
00:54:54,183 --> 00:54:55,576
Makes you wonder what
Matthew's done

765
00:54:55,618 --> 00:54:58,045
to make it so hard to sleep at
night.

766
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,988
Well, running any town has
its fair share of stresses.

767
00:55:01,957 --> 00:55:04,451
And Norfork certainly
ain't an ordinary town.

768
00:55:04,493 --> 00:55:05,426
Hmm.

769
00:55:06,662 --> 00:55:07,554
Shall we?

770
00:55:08,464 --> 00:55:09,456
So that's when I told her,

771
00:55:09,498 --> 00:55:11,558
"You can lead a horse to water,

772
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:14,428
but you can't make him fish."

773
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:20,734
Another one, sweetie?

774
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:21,708
Of course.

775
00:55:31,687 --> 00:55:32,813
Evening, Miss Annie.

776
00:55:32,855 --> 00:55:36,417
I just wanted to thank
you again for that hog.

777
00:55:36,459 --> 00:55:38,619
Emma's been having bacon
sandwiches all week.

778
00:55:38,661 --> 00:55:40,861
Ooh, now you're making me
hungry, Mick.

779
00:55:41,997 --> 00:55:43,891
Since Emma's mom passed,

780
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:46,527
we've had a wide, empty space
in our home.

781
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:47,895
Charlie's had enough, Torb.

782
00:55:47,937 --> 00:55:50,063
He's doing that circle walk
thing again.

783
00:55:50,105 --> 00:55:51,765
Get him out.

784
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:56,537
Er, I just wanna say if
you'd ever consider joining us,

785
00:55:56,579 --> 00:55:59,807
we'd be so grateful to
welcome you into our home.

786
00:55:59,849 --> 00:56:01,108
Me?

787
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:02,483
Playing house?

788
00:56:03,619 --> 00:56:05,052
Mick, can you imagine?

789
00:56:07,189 --> 00:56:10,691
No, no, I, I guess not.

790
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:12,993
Apologies, Miss Annie.

791
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:18,131
Oh hell.

792
00:56:19,768 --> 00:56:21,762
You see, that's why they don't
let me live inside the wall.

793
00:56:21,804 --> 00:56:24,271
I'd have the whole town
against me in a day.

794
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:27,007
Not everyone.

795
00:56:29,812 --> 00:56:32,045
Why James, how mighty
chivalrous of you.

796
00:56:32,982 --> 00:56:34,741
You defend my honor?

797
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:36,726
Me?

798
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:38,752
No, no, I meant, I was
talking about Douglas.

799
00:56:39,555 --> 00:56:40,948
He could be friends with the
devil.

800
00:56:43,725 --> 00:56:45,252
James, I'm sorry, I know
that's...

801
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:49,563
Does it hurt?

802
00:56:52,001 --> 00:56:54,167
You shaking hands with
lightening or what?

803
00:56:56,605 --> 00:56:58,005
Almost lost it completely.

804
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:02,042
You don't gotta tell
me if you don't want to.

805
00:57:03,812 --> 00:57:04,945
It's not my business.

806
00:57:09,218 --> 00:57:11,585
Scars do come with good stories
though.

807
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,822
Did you always wanna be a
hunter, Annie?

808
00:57:21,864 --> 00:57:23,163
I don't know about want.

809
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,767
It's just what I've always done.

810
00:57:27,636 --> 00:57:28,802
Always been good at it.

811
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:33,140
I've always wanted to be a
physician.

812
00:57:34,944 --> 00:57:35,876
Always.

813
00:57:37,613 --> 00:57:39,179
Ever since I can remember.

814
00:57:40,115 --> 00:57:42,876
But out there, it's
hard for people like me

815
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,284
to get the proper schooling.

816
00:57:45,187 --> 00:57:46,253
Even up north.

817
00:57:51,193 --> 00:57:52,626
Unless you enlisted.

818
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,222
Not that I had a choice
with the conscription,

819
00:57:55,264 --> 00:57:58,131
but I chose to be a medic.

820
00:58:03,138 --> 00:58:04,631
It seems like the war never
really

821
00:58:04,673 --> 00:58:06,239
hit you all here in Norfork.

822
00:58:07,676 --> 00:58:08,942
Mostly stories.

823
00:58:10,279 --> 00:58:12,212
Well, it hit pretty hard out
there.

824
00:58:13,382 --> 00:58:15,115
I'm not much of a fighter, but,

825
00:58:16,352 --> 00:58:18,352
I learned a lot in those field
clinics.

826
00:58:20,155 --> 00:58:22,656
Pain and death like you never
imagined.

827
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:29,289
I was with the 18th under
Butler,

828
00:58:29,331 --> 00:58:31,398
we were moving south outside
Richmond.

829
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:34,735
Whole unit ambushed.

830
00:58:36,038 --> 00:58:40,100
Barely had time to get
our drawers on.

831
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,768
We got the triage tent set up,

832
00:58:41,810 --> 00:58:44,344
but it was all I could do
to keep the water boiling.

833
00:58:48,083 --> 00:58:52,346
And then I heard it like a
low thunder in the ground.

834
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:56,383
The gray coats were
losing and they knew that,

835
00:58:56,425 --> 00:58:59,359
so they just wanted to hurt us.

836
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:07,000
Half a dozen horses stampede
on through the tent.

837
00:59:11,807 --> 00:59:13,407
I can still feel the razor wire

838
00:59:16,045 --> 00:59:18,912
cutting into my arm as
they wrapped it around.

839
00:59:23,952 --> 00:59:26,787
They told me later I
was dragged half a mile.

840
00:59:28,724 --> 00:59:32,459
Found me in a creek, wasn't
dead, might as well have been.

841
00:59:35,097 --> 00:59:36,539
It's a hell of the thing,

842
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:38,064
going from useful to useless in
a moment.

843
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:45,372
So when my uncle sent word,
well,

844
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,443
well, it didn't matter where it
was.

845
00:59:56,819 --> 00:59:59,019
I'd rather you not let that
story wander.

846
01:00:00,723 --> 01:00:02,182
I haven't told my uncle yet,

847
01:00:02,224 --> 01:00:03,383
not the full of it anyway.

848
01:00:03,425 --> 01:00:05,058
To hell with Matthew.

849
01:00:07,296 --> 01:00:09,162
You're a good doctor, James.

850
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:13,160
He has no right to judge
you for your scars.

851
01:00:13,202 --> 01:00:15,402
Thanks to Matthew, I have a
place here.

852
01:00:16,405 --> 01:00:17,437
In these walls.

853
01:00:19,942 --> 01:00:21,475
Out there, I had nothing.

854
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:27,314
Be careful.

855
01:00:30,085 --> 01:00:31,218
You're not safe.

856
01:00:32,387 --> 01:00:33,320
Not really.

857
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:38,018
Sure, you do as they say
and you'll be protected,

858
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:39,793
but the second you step out,

859
01:00:42,831 --> 01:00:44,291
you'll be getting it like
any of these other people

860
01:00:44,333 --> 01:00:47,994
with scars on their faces
and something missing.

861
01:00:48,036 --> 01:00:50,197
Why don't you leave then,
Annie?

862
01:00:50,239 --> 01:00:51,131
Huh?

863
01:00:51,173 --> 01:00:54,167
Why not get out of here if it's
so rotten?

864
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:56,837
See how they treat you if
you're different out there.

865
01:00:56,879 --> 01:00:58,411
You think they'd let me leave?

866
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:01,508
Truth is the old doc
didn't make it 20 yards

867
01:01:01,550 --> 01:01:03,917
outside that gate before
the ghost got him.

868
01:01:04,887 --> 01:01:06,853
This is a prison, James.

869
01:01:07,956 --> 01:01:10,016
They've convinced the
inmates it's a paradise,

870
01:01:10,058 --> 01:01:12,459
and that paradise sure
didn't save my daddy.

871
01:01:20,169 --> 01:01:21,301
Better not, Torb.

872
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,571
I've had enough.

873
01:01:27,442 --> 01:01:28,802
You know, I reckon it'll be a
slow day

874
01:01:28,844 --> 01:01:30,010
at the clinic tomorrow.

875
01:01:32,481 --> 01:01:33,847
I can do it on my own.

876
01:01:47,095 --> 01:01:50,096
Sure you want to be stepping
back into the clinic, lass?

877
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,499
He needed help.

878
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:57,037
Might as well be me
that keeps him company.

879
01:02:05,314 --> 01:02:07,380
I think I might find him a bit
charming.

880
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:15,422
William's late.

881
01:02:17,259 --> 01:02:19,025
I'm tired of waiting on that
boy.

882
01:02:22,898 --> 01:02:24,524
Mind yourself, little lady.

883
01:02:24,566 --> 01:02:25,966
Storm's coming.

884
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,029
Darlin'.

885
01:03:29,665 --> 01:03:31,258
Oh god, Annie.

886
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:32,966
What's happened?

887
01:03:34,703 --> 01:03:35,996
Their bounty!

888
01:03:36,038 --> 01:03:37,370
Everybody out!

889
01:03:38,273 --> 01:03:39,205
Out!

890
01:03:46,682 --> 01:03:48,608
William, wake James.

891
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,050
I'm right here.

892
01:03:51,553 --> 01:03:53,246
Oh my god, Annie!

893
01:03:54,472 --> 01:03:55,615
William, she's gonna be all
right.

894
01:03:55,657 --> 01:03:57,417
James, you need something from
the clinic?

895
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:59,052
Iodine, forceps, needle and
thread

896
01:03:59,094 --> 01:04:00,921
and a lot of gauze, go.

897
01:04:00,963 --> 01:04:03,556
And there's a bottle, Matthew's
tincture bottle, grab it.

898
01:04:03,598 --> 01:04:05,358
Torb, Torb, we need clean water,

899
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,167
and Lucille, that rag.

900
01:04:11,373 --> 01:04:12,305
Alcohol!

901
01:04:19,548 --> 01:04:22,008
We have to close the laceration.

902
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:24,044
Hold it tight, hold it.

903
01:04:24,086 --> 01:04:25,018
Alcohol!

904
01:04:32,995 --> 01:04:36,256
Hold her down, she's gonna feel
it.

905
01:04:36,298 --> 01:04:37,657
Sh, sh, sh, sh,

906
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:40,393
I'm sorry, hey, it's okay,
it's okay, you're okay.

907
01:04:40,435 --> 01:04:43,563
Just keep her, hold her
tight, hold her tight.

908
01:04:58,620 --> 01:04:59,552
Torb.

909
01:05:37,759 --> 01:05:38,691
Torb.

910
01:05:52,474 --> 01:05:53,373
Torb.

911
01:05:58,146 --> 01:06:00,146
Darlin'

912
01:07:16,358 --> 01:07:17,817
Annie.

913
01:07:17,859 --> 01:07:18,791
Annie.

914
01:07:21,596 --> 01:07:22,729
Who did this?

915
01:07:26,568 --> 01:07:27,500
William.

916
01:07:37,712 --> 01:07:40,874
Er, I can go, I can go talk to
Matthew,

917
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:43,383
and he'll know what to do.

918
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:47,754
Er,

919
01:07:49,324 --> 01:07:51,858
Annie, Annie, Annie, hey, take
this.

920
01:07:53,828 --> 01:07:55,588
You need your rest.

921
01:07:55,630 --> 01:07:56,529
Please, no.

922
01:07:58,266 --> 01:07:59,425
It'll help.

923
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:00,533
It'll numb the pain.

924
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,408
Whoever did this is gonna pay.

925
01:08:09,344 --> 01:08:10,870
I'm gonna talk to my uncle,
and then we're gonna-

926
01:08:10,912 --> 01:08:11,844
- William.

927
01:08:13,982 --> 01:08:14,881
William.

928
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:17,884
I wanna go home.

929
01:08:18,820 --> 01:08:20,914
No, no, no no, she needs to
stay,

930
01:08:20,956 --> 01:08:22,849
you need to stay and heal.

931
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:23,990
Please, no.

932
01:08:25,594 --> 01:08:28,361
Oh, all right, all right,
just,

933
01:08:29,965 --> 01:08:31,941
give her this.

934
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,000
It's the strongest thing I
got for pain, but dilute it.

935
01:08:41,876 --> 01:08:42,936
James.

936
01:08:42,978 --> 01:08:44,404
James, I got something to show
you.

937
01:08:44,446 --> 01:08:45,939
I ain't in the mood
for no new hat, Douglas.

938
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:48,208
No it's not that, but it's at
my shop,

939
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:49,309
if you'd just come with me.

940
01:08:49,351 --> 01:08:50,810
Annie was attacked, okay?

941
01:08:50,852 --> 01:08:52,745
I need to go talk to my uncle,
I'm sorry,

942
01:08:52,787 --> 01:08:54,997
but I really need to go talk to
him.

943
01:08:55,039 --> 01:08:57,250
I know, I know she
was attacked, I saw it.

944
01:08:57,292 --> 01:09:00,253
Just come with me, James,
you gotta see this.

945
01:09:31,559 --> 01:09:32,919
Afternoon, fellas.

946
01:09:37,699 --> 01:09:38,624
This Joe and Mick?

947
01:09:38,666 --> 01:09:39,592
These the boys that attacked
Annie,

948
01:09:39,634 --> 01:09:41,761
but the ghosts caught 'em.

949
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:43,245
What?

950
01:09:43,287 --> 01:09:44,731
No, no, Mick wouldn't hurt a
fly.

951
01:09:44,773 --> 01:09:46,372
Where's the rest of 'em?

952
01:09:52,047 --> 01:09:53,846
We gotta keep going.

953
01:09:58,420 --> 01:10:00,913
See, I was up on the tower,

954
01:10:00,955 --> 01:10:03,589
trying to get a plate
before the storm rolled in.

955
01:10:07,095 --> 01:10:09,555
That's when I heard it,
screaming.

956
01:10:11,298 --> 01:10:12,998
I looked over towards the
clinic and there she was.

957
01:10:18,039 --> 01:10:19,572
She was being accosted.

958
01:10:27,349 --> 01:10:28,524
I shoulda gone down,

959
01:10:28,566 --> 01:10:29,782
and done something, I
shoulda intervened, but,

960
01:10:31,619 --> 01:10:32,885
I'm a coward.

961
01:10:36,358 --> 01:10:38,818
Annie was just fighting for her
life.

962
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,960
I did the only thing I could
think to do.

963
01:10:46,468 --> 01:10:47,400
What is this?

964
01:10:50,004 --> 01:10:52,498
It's Matthew, he musta been
there.

965
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:54,500
This doesn't make any sense,

966
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:56,803
you saying he attacked
Annie with those boys?

967
01:10:56,845 --> 01:10:59,946
No, but he was there,
watching, just

968
01:11:00,782 --> 01:11:01,741
waiting for something.

969
01:11:01,783 --> 01:11:02,815
Waiting for what?

970
01:11:03,618 --> 01:11:05,478
The damn cavalry to arrive?

971
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,413
I'm sorry, James.

972
01:11:15,830 --> 01:11:16,763
Uncle.

973
01:11:18,032 --> 01:11:18,965
James.

974
01:11:20,635 --> 01:11:21,567
You knew.

975
01:11:22,871 --> 01:11:26,005
She was attacked and you
just watched it happen?

976
01:11:27,876 --> 01:11:29,942
My part is thankless, but I
played it.

977
01:11:31,112 --> 01:11:32,805
How do you mean?

978
01:11:32,847 --> 01:11:34,714
By calling the ghosts, of
course.

979
01:11:35,717 --> 01:11:37,443
Breaking the beloved rules,

980
01:11:37,485 --> 01:11:38,985
entering our haven to save her.

981
01:11:39,821 --> 01:11:41,396
At least I did something

982
01:11:41,438 --> 01:11:43,015
instead of documenting the
perversion.

983
01:11:43,057 --> 01:11:43,950
If I didn't,

984
01:11:43,992 --> 01:11:47,954
that poor Stone girl
would be dead as we speak.

985
01:11:47,996 --> 01:11:50,423
Joe and Mick cut her up
something good.

986
01:11:50,465 --> 01:11:51,157
Mick.

987
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:55,695
He was in love with Annie,
everyone could see it.

988
01:11:55,737 --> 01:11:57,163
Not a bad bone in his body.

989
01:11:57,205 --> 01:11:58,871
And then you came into town,

990
01:12:00,008 --> 01:12:03,403
and the jealousy and spite
that you've been creating,

991
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:04,944
he's been festering that anger.

992
01:12:06,181 --> 01:12:08,508
Musta convinced Joe to help him

993
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,710
make sure that if he couldn't
have Annie,

994
01:12:10,752 --> 01:12:11,684
no one could.

995
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:13,846
I know it's upsetting,

996
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:16,416
but in a moment, we'll
go down to the festival-

997
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:17,190
- What are those?

998
01:12:20,228 --> 01:12:22,088
Just some trinkets.

999
01:12:22,130 --> 01:12:23,572
Why do you have Joe's stones?

1000
01:12:23,614 --> 01:12:25,097
They're not Joe's stones!

1001
01:12:34,008 --> 01:12:35,675
They belong to Norfork, James.

1002
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:39,212
I can't keep this town
running on gas alone.

1003
01:12:42,884 --> 01:12:43,816
The mines.

1004
01:12:45,687 --> 01:12:48,981
You're not just mining gas.

1005
01:12:49,023 --> 01:12:50,523
You're mining diamonds.

1006
01:12:51,493 --> 01:12:53,853
This whole town is sitting on a
fortune.

1007
01:12:53,895 --> 01:12:56,496
They have no idea the
riches right beneath them.

1008
01:12:57,632 --> 01:13:00,226
Best not bother the common
folk

1009
01:13:00,268 --> 01:13:03,503
with the burden of their
charitable keepers.

1010
01:13:04,906 --> 01:13:06,799
Their charitable keepers?

1011
01:13:06,841 --> 01:13:08,634
They would be corrupted.

1012
01:13:08,676 --> 01:13:09,569
Joe was.

1013
01:13:09,611 --> 01:13:13,673
And, he had a severe lack
of respect for hierarchy.

1014
01:13:13,715 --> 01:13:14,914
I don't believe this.

1015
01:13:15,783 --> 01:13:18,144
You are lying to an entire town.

1016
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:19,578
Hiding something that-

1017
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,053
- Interesting choice of words,
James.

1018
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,084
You mean the way that you've
been hiding?

1019
01:13:25,126 --> 01:13:26,058
From me?

1020
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,261
Your own flesh and blood.

1021
01:13:29,831 --> 01:13:31,597
Seems ungrateful, no?

1022
01:13:35,136 --> 01:13:38,104
I've done everything you and
this town have asked of me.

1023
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,200
And you wanna condemn me for my
scars?

1024
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:43,843
I couldn't give a damn
about that mangled wing!

1025
01:13:48,149 --> 01:13:49,391
I've known since day one.

1026
01:13:49,433 --> 01:13:50,716
What I can't stand is
the deceit of the matter.

1027
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:53,553
Something you're well versed
in.

1028
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:56,155
Oh, James.

1029
01:13:58,326 --> 01:14:01,027
I wanted you to be the one
to take over my purpose.

1030
01:14:02,664 --> 01:14:04,597
But I can see now that was a
mistake.

1031
01:14:05,266 --> 01:14:09,635
The good people of this town
deserve to know the truth,

1032
01:14:10,572 --> 01:14:14,267
so they can decide for
themselves what's best for them.

1033
01:14:14,309 --> 01:14:18,037
When in history has
that ever led to anything

1034
01:14:18,079 --> 01:14:19,278
other than suppression

1035
01:14:20,848 --> 01:14:23,109
and the exploitation of the
weak?

1036
01:14:23,151 --> 01:14:26,118
And how is that different
from what you've created here?

1037
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,697
Have you forgotten already

1038
01:14:38,866 --> 01:14:40,600
what it is like for us

1039
01:14:42,604 --> 01:14:43,369
out there?

1040
01:14:45,707 --> 01:14:47,833
Because I am reminded of it
every time

1041
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:50,743
I step off that train in New
Orleans.

1042
01:14:52,647 --> 01:14:53,913
Every single time.

1043
01:15:00,355 --> 01:15:01,247
You,

1044
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:06,225
you know exactly how
these people would react

1045
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:09,895
without the ghosts keeping them
in line.

1046
01:15:11,366 --> 01:15:13,232
You do know that, don't you,
James?

1047
01:15:15,069 --> 01:15:16,268
How the hell else could

1048
01:15:20,842 --> 01:15:21,783
a person like me

1049
01:15:21,825 --> 01:15:22,807
run a town full of people like
them?

1050
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,318
Annie was right all along.

1051
01:15:33,287 --> 01:15:34,253
This ain't safety.

1052
01:15:36,658 --> 01:15:38,991
And I'm the damn fool
that didn't believe her.

1053
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:16,962
We can fight 'em,

1054
01:16:18,099 --> 01:16:19,392
but I can't do it alone.

1055
01:16:19,434 --> 01:16:23,469
I'm sorry, Samuel, but we
can't risk what we've built.

1056
01:16:25,807 --> 01:16:27,840
First one to the edge and
back wins.

1057
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:33,839
Bastards

1058
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:35,808
William!

1059
01:16:47,161 --> 01:16:48,788
Haven't you taken enough?

1060
01:16:48,830 --> 01:16:49,855
Pa?

1061
01:16:49,897 --> 01:16:51,390
Pa, no!

1062
01:16:51,432 --> 01:16:53,199
William, be quiet.

1063
01:16:54,769 --> 01:16:57,430
Take care of your sister.

1064
01:17:05,179 --> 01:17:08,240
William, you need to go get
James, go.

1065
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,453
Little late for a stroll
in the woods, James.

1066
01:17:15,823 --> 01:17:17,490
I don't think that's a good
idea.

1067
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:43,549
William?

1068
01:18:22,423 --> 01:18:23,355
William.

1069
01:18:56,123 --> 01:18:57,456
These pipes

1070
01:18:58,392 --> 01:19:01,260
keep this place nice
and warm if I do say so.

1071
01:19:07,902 --> 01:19:08,934
What do you want?

1072
01:19:11,172 --> 01:19:12,137
Your loyalty.

1073
01:19:31,425 --> 01:19:34,593
I've kept my peace
here, we had an agreement.

1074
01:19:36,197 --> 01:19:38,197
I didn't wanna take those
eyes, Torb.

1075
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:42,127
And what did Annie do?

1076
01:19:42,169 --> 01:19:45,130
She was outta line, you know
it.

1077
01:19:45,172 --> 01:19:46,398
Something had to be done.

1078
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:50,342
Can't have her mouthing off
like that, like her daddy did.

1079
01:19:53,314 --> 01:19:56,382
If you hurt another hair on
her head.

1080
01:19:57,251 --> 01:19:59,218
There's nobody here 'cept us,
Torb.

1081
01:20:00,521 --> 01:20:02,054
You can stop with the show.

1082
01:20:04,058 --> 01:20:06,886
We both know what you do
when you have to choose.

1083
01:20:06,928 --> 01:20:08,454
You son of a bitch.

1084
01:20:08,496 --> 01:20:10,362
You made the right choice
before.

1085
01:20:11,432 --> 01:20:13,499
I want you to make the right
choice again.

1086
01:20:17,672 --> 01:20:18,637
These walls,

1087
01:20:21,509 --> 01:20:22,574
they're not yours.

1088
01:20:23,711 --> 01:20:25,611
They belong to Norfork.

1089
01:20:27,081 --> 01:20:28,280
Remember that.

1090
01:21:04,585 --> 01:21:06,445
You bastards!

1091
01:21:36,617 --> 01:21:38,317
William, William stop.

1092
01:21:44,692 --> 01:21:47,426
I think we, I think we lost it.

1093
01:21:49,397 --> 01:21:51,130
If you hadn't come when you did,

1094
01:21:54,035 --> 01:21:54,800
why did you?

1095
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,674
Matthew's medicine?

1096
01:22:07,348 --> 01:22:08,280
The fog.

1097
01:22:11,552 --> 01:22:15,080
Matthew's controlling those
things, I'd bet my life on it.

1098
01:22:15,122 --> 01:22:16,088
Where's Annie?

1099
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:26,592
William, William, no, don't.

1100
01:22:26,634 --> 01:22:28,093
William!

1101
01:22:28,135 --> 01:22:29,461
Don't!

1102
01:22:29,503 --> 01:22:30,436
Annie.

1103
01:22:32,473 --> 01:22:33,405
Annie!

1104
01:22:38,579 --> 01:22:39,511
No.

1105
01:22:42,817 --> 01:22:43,749
William!

1106
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:08,700
Who you wanna be tonight?

1107
01:23:29,330 --> 01:23:30,722
We don't want no part of
today.

1108
01:23:30,764 --> 01:23:33,165
Go on, do your celebrating
outside.

1109
01:23:43,911 --> 01:23:45,537
Oh, boys.

1110
01:23:45,579 --> 01:23:46,645
You had us worried.

1111
01:23:47,615 --> 01:23:49,274
Hi, lads.

1112
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:50,716
Thank gods you're alive.

1113
01:23:52,419 --> 01:23:54,346
William, where is
Annie?

1114
01:23:54,388 --> 01:23:55,821
They got to her.

1115
01:24:00,828 --> 01:24:05,497
My uncle, he's, he's somehow
controlling these things.

1116
01:24:11,472 --> 01:24:12,631
We know.

1117
01:24:17,278 --> 01:24:19,638
William, what, what
do you know?

1118
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,373
William, wait!

1119
01:24:21,415 --> 01:24:22,581
What is going on here?

1120
01:24:24,318 --> 01:24:26,685
It was never
supposed to be like this.

1121
01:24:27,688 --> 01:24:29,915
Norfork, my good people.

1122
01:24:36,230 --> 01:24:37,556
What a night.

1123
01:24:37,598 --> 01:24:41,934
It reminds me of a similar
evening 25 years ago.

1124
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:45,330
Damn, am I proud of what we've
become.

1125
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:46,732
Hmm?

1126
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:48,373
When we came upon this place,

1127
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:51,343
well, we knew it was something
special.

1128
01:24:52,213 --> 01:24:54,206
Back then, there was just a few
of us

1129
01:24:54,248 --> 01:24:55,474
looking for that promise.

1130
01:24:55,516 --> 01:25:01,446
Torb, Lucille, founding members,
take that silly sign down.

1131
01:25:01,488 --> 01:25:03,182
Come join the festivities, now,
come on.

1132
01:25:10,598 --> 01:25:12,357
That beautiful city on the hill.

1133
01:25:12,399 --> 01:25:13,926
But it wasn't just out
there waiting for us.

1134
01:25:13,968 --> 01:25:16,728
No sir, we had to build it.

1135
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:17,903
But we were not alone.

1136
01:25:19,840 --> 01:25:22,274
Because of the righteousness
of our agendas,

1137
01:25:23,377 --> 01:25:24,309
we were blessed.

1138
01:25:27,715 --> 01:25:30,576
We owe everything to our ghosts.

1139
01:25:35,389 --> 01:25:36,882
They protect us

1140
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:39,851
and bind us to this place!

1141
01:25:39,893 --> 01:25:42,561
They deliver justice to any soul

1142
01:25:43,430 --> 01:25:45,264
who would violate those
boundaries.

1143
01:25:46,834 --> 01:25:50,469
There are even those
amongst you who would poison

1144
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:53,232
and doubt their power.

1145
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:57,709
Who would do harm to their
neighbor, to you or I.

1146
01:25:59,413 --> 01:26:01,313
Or our poor, dear Annie.

1147
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:04,943
I truly wish that they'd come
sooner,

1148
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:07,452
before she suffered from
her grievous wounds.

1149
01:26:08,355 --> 01:26:09,388
Oh, my good people.

1150
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,424
There is no escaping their
wrath.

1151
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:14,826
For it is absolute!

1152
01:26:16,730 --> 01:26:18,664
And they have brought to us
justice,

1153
01:26:19,667 --> 01:26:20,932
and punished the guilty.

1154
01:26:25,706 --> 01:26:28,600
And we have discovered another
conspirator

1155
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:31,043
of that most gruesome of attack.

1156
01:26:32,613 --> 01:26:37,683
On this day of celebration,
25 years of honor.

1157
01:26:37,885 --> 01:26:41,653
25 years of purpose and safety.

1158
01:26:44,024 --> 01:26:47,459
Let us renew our pact with our
ghosts.

1159
01:26:52,700 --> 01:26:56,528
To those who oppose us and our
ways,

1160
01:26:56,570 --> 01:26:59,731
this is your final warning.

1161
01:27:03,711 --> 01:27:07,039
This man seeks to corrupt their
power,

1162
01:27:07,081 --> 01:27:08,947
to distort their purpose.

1163
01:27:13,487 --> 01:27:14,613
Douglas.

1164
01:27:14,655 --> 01:27:15,747
Douglas.

1165
01:27:15,789 --> 01:27:17,983
He does not honor our ghosts.

1166
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:52,824
Down.

1167
01:27:53,994 --> 01:27:57,863
Dovvy, put him down.

1168
01:28:22,689 --> 01:28:23,622
Hey.

1169
01:28:24,725 --> 01:28:27,893
James, James, sorry, James.

1170
01:28:30,864 --> 01:28:33,865
I should'a done something.

1171
01:28:38,071 --> 01:28:39,004
Oh, Douglas.

1172
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:40,906
It's okay.

1173
01:28:43,043 --> 01:28:43,901
Douglas.

1174
01:28:43,943 --> 01:28:44,803
There you are,
James.

1175
01:28:44,845 --> 01:28:45,811
God damn you!

1176
01:28:47,681 --> 01:28:49,080
Someone do something!

1177
01:28:50,517 --> 01:28:52,184
I was afraid you'd miss all
this.

1178
01:29:22,516 --> 01:29:25,083
This town needs to hear the
truth.

1179
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:27,652
I agree, James.

1180
01:29:31,058 --> 01:29:32,557
For you see, good people,

1181
01:29:33,660 --> 01:29:35,527
I did not tell you the full
matter,

1182
01:29:36,763 --> 01:29:37,963
out of a familial duty.

1183
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,633
I tried to protect my nephew.

1184
01:29:43,904 --> 01:29:46,898
It was at James's hands
that our sweet Annie died.

1185
01:29:46,940 --> 01:29:49,701
His inept, incapable hands.

1186
01:29:49,743 --> 01:29:51,603
You goddamn liar!

1187
01:29:51,645 --> 01:29:53,071
I'm the liar?

1188
01:29:53,113 --> 01:29:55,240
Her house was set ablaze.

1189
01:29:58,952 --> 01:30:01,820
He lied about his
abilities as a physician.

1190
01:30:02,756 --> 01:30:03,989
He lied to us all.

1191
01:30:05,526 --> 01:30:08,253
He placed all your lives in
jeopardy.

1192
01:30:08,295 --> 01:30:09,761
Your children's lives.

1193
01:30:11,598 --> 01:30:15,560
Do they know you let Annie be
attacked?

1194
01:30:17,804 --> 01:30:19,137
Because of what she saw?

1195
01:30:20,040 --> 01:30:22,240
And what Douglas knows, of what
I know?

1196
01:30:23,644 --> 01:30:26,905
You've been using them as
your personal monsters.

1197
01:30:26,947 --> 01:30:29,040
Protecting your damn diamonds,

1198
01:30:29,082 --> 01:30:31,650
to hide and hoard what
belongs to these people.

1199
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:34,119
Oh nephew,

1200
01:30:35,322 --> 01:30:37,289
I was afraid you weren't up for
the task.

1201
01:30:38,725 --> 01:30:40,125
You were a useless man then,

1202
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:42,961
and you're a useless man now.

1203
01:30:48,835 --> 01:30:51,169
Rook, C5.

1204
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,213
Why are you all just standing
there?

1205
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:10,221
Because they know the rules,
James.

1206
01:31:11,725 --> 01:31:13,184
They know their place.

1207
01:31:13,226 --> 01:31:15,587
There is no revenge on the dead.

1208
01:31:15,629 --> 01:31:18,096
You can't fight the will of
ghosts, boy.

1209
01:31:18,966 --> 01:31:20,125
A ghost.

1210
01:31:25,105 --> 01:31:26,037
Jesse?

1211
01:31:32,212 --> 01:31:34,379
The ghosts are a lie.

1212
01:31:35,616 --> 01:31:37,141
Annie.

1213
01:31:37,183 --> 01:31:38,710
They are your neighbors
cloaked in deceit,

1214
01:31:38,752 --> 01:31:40,612
do not trust him.

1215
01:31:40,654 --> 01:31:41,746
Take her!

1216
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:42,721
Everyone!

1217
01:31:47,361 --> 01:31:49,194
Ghosts, protect these walls.

1218
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,716
They're just parlor tricks,

1219
01:32:17,758 --> 01:32:19,918
it's all just damn parlor
tricks.

1220
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:20,892
Annie.

1221
01:32:21,862 --> 01:32:23,928
I thought you were dead.

1222
01:32:25,265 --> 01:32:27,198
Just playin' possum.

1223
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,832
Where did my uncle go?

1224
01:32:33,874 --> 01:32:34,806
James.

1225
01:32:35,776 --> 01:32:36,968
He's gassing the whole town.

1226
01:32:37,010 --> 01:32:39,204
These damn walls are
keeping the poison in.

1227
01:32:39,246 --> 01:32:41,940
You need to open the
gate, get the people out.

1228
01:32:56,830 --> 01:32:57,989
- I can't see.
- I can't, my eyes!

1229
01:32:58,031 --> 01:32:59,391
Help!

1230
01:33:07,074 --> 01:33:08,099
- Everybody.
- Let's go.

1231
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:09,334
Follow us.

1232
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:11,369
We gotta get clear of the wall.

1233
01:33:11,411 --> 01:33:13,211
Come on, let's go.

1234
01:33:17,117 --> 01:33:18,049
Quick!

1235
01:33:18,919 --> 01:33:20,779
Don't breathe it in.

1236
01:33:32,999 --> 01:33:34,726
Elijah! Elijah

1237
01:33:34,768 --> 01:33:35,927
What's wrong?

1238
01:33:35,969 --> 01:33:37,195
They have him!

1239
01:33:37,237 --> 01:33:38,897
- They have my son!
- I know, I'll find him,

1240
01:33:38,939 --> 01:33:40,398
- I'll find him.
- James, James.

1241
01:33:40,440 --> 01:33:42,033
There's more in there.

1242
01:33:44,878 --> 01:33:46,404
Let me out!

1243
01:33:46,446 --> 01:33:47,906
- Let me out!
- Let's go!

1244
01:34:02,763 --> 01:34:03,495
Elijah?

1245
01:34:07,534 --> 01:34:08,466
Elijah?

1246
01:34:13,039 --> 01:34:14,399
Elijah!

1247
01:34:14,441 --> 01:34:15,934
- I'm here.
- Elijah.

1248
01:34:15,976 --> 01:34:17,202
Go, the gate's that way, keep
going.

1249
01:34:17,244 --> 01:34:18,970
Your mom's there.

1250
01:34:24,351 --> 01:34:26,785
Miss Roberts, lend
me a hand?

1251
01:34:27,954 --> 01:34:30,348
You were
supposed to scare Annie,

1252
01:34:30,390 --> 01:34:32,183
not try and kill the poor girl.

1253
01:34:32,225 --> 01:34:35,186
I'm through with this horseshit.

1254
01:34:38,098 --> 01:34:39,998
Look at your dream,
uncle.

1255
01:34:41,434 --> 01:34:43,234
Is this your vision?

1256
01:34:51,144 --> 01:34:52,904
Damn Stones!

1257
01:34:52,946 --> 01:34:55,240
I shoulda taken you whelps
when I took your daddy.

1258
01:34:57,884 --> 01:34:59,544
You coward!

1259
01:35:04,591 --> 01:35:06,251
You damn fool.

1260
01:35:06,293 --> 01:35:07,959
Why'd you do that?

1261
01:35:08,929 --> 01:35:10,461
Put on that mask.

1262
01:35:15,268 --> 01:35:17,562
Come on, let's go.

1263
01:35:33,153 --> 01:35:34,419
Come on, James.

1264
01:35:57,377 --> 01:35:59,644
Could you fetch me a wash
rag, love?

1265
01:36:08,655 --> 01:36:12,657
I reckon they'll be taking
those eyesores down.

1266
01:36:20,934 --> 01:36:21,666
Lucille?

1267
01:36:25,972 --> 01:36:26,905
Lucille?

1268
01:36:32,212 --> 01:36:33,144
Darlin'?

1269
01:36:39,986 --> 01:36:41,085
What have you done?

1270
01:36:44,157 --> 01:36:45,149
Taking your eyes wasn't enough,

1271
01:36:45,191 --> 01:36:47,191
you gonna make me take her too?

1272
01:36:51,164 --> 01:36:53,658
You step off that porch,
you know you're a dead man.

1273
01:36:55,068 --> 01:36:56,634
No, not that now.

1274
01:36:57,504 --> 01:37:00,538
Don't worry love, I'm here.

1275
01:37:04,644 --> 01:37:06,244
25 years,

1276
01:37:07,113 --> 01:37:08,079
all of us,

1277
01:37:09,482 --> 01:37:11,683
we were going to make
something that worked.

1278
01:37:12,619 --> 01:37:15,987
Our own rules, simple and pure.

1279
01:37:18,491 --> 01:37:21,125
We chose you because you were
the best.

1280
01:37:24,230 --> 01:37:25,730
There wasn't even a question.

1281
01:37:28,702 --> 01:37:30,295
But Samuel had the right of it.

1282
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,706
And I knew it too.

1283
01:37:35,976 --> 01:37:37,402
But I was too afraid.

1284
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:42,013
I thought I could be safe here.

1285
01:37:43,183 --> 01:37:46,477
In my little sanctuary, on my
mountain!

1286
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:53,591
You goddamn old fool.

1287
01:37:55,095 --> 01:37:56,494
These were our rules.

1288
01:37:58,331 --> 01:38:00,959
We built this place together.

1289
01:38:03,770 --> 01:38:06,170
These walls are haven,

1290
01:38:08,575 --> 01:38:10,535
honor our ghosts,

1291
01:38:10,577 --> 01:38:12,210
to each his purpose.

1292
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:57,789
My girl.

1293
01:39:15,575 --> 01:39:16,607
My girl.

1294
01:39:48,308 --> 01:39:50,508
Well, what do we do now?

1295
01:39:53,646 --> 01:39:55,473
There seems to be an opening.

1296
01:39:55,515 --> 01:39:58,583
They won't want another McCune
running things around here.

1297
01:39:59,586 --> 01:40:01,219
Name don't set your fate.

1298
01:40:04,124 --> 01:40:04,889
You ain't him.

1299
01:40:07,527 --> 01:40:08,726
It won't be the same.

1300
01:40:11,231 --> 01:40:12,163
It won't.

1301
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:15,359
It'll be better.

1302
01:41:19,966 --> 01:41:22,827
There are
stories of a storm so strong

1303
01:41:22,869 --> 01:41:25,436
that its winds spread
across the whole world.

1304
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:33,237
Stories of a tree whose seeds
were carried in that wind

1305
01:41:33,279 --> 01:41:34,779
to the other side of the globe.

1306
01:41:37,250 --> 01:41:39,517
A tree with no intentions but
to survive

1307
01:41:43,823 --> 01:41:45,799
and flourish in its home.

1308
01:41:45,841 --> 01:41:47,858
Whose progeny can now be
found on every continent,

1309
01:41:49,495 --> 01:41:53,357
in every country.

1310
01:41:53,399 --> 01:41:55,800
All it takes for that
seed to grow is time.

1311
01:42:02,942 --> 01:42:04,569
And time

1312
01:42:04,611 --> 01:42:06,344
is all there is out here.

1313
01:43:21,683 --> 01:43:26,683
