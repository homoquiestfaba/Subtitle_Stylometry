I was out with Billy.

71
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:09,974

72
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,540
Thank you, Kim.

73
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:15,451
Oh, I'm sorry, handsome.

74
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,960

missy, it's a school night.

you hear me?

76
00:09:23,629 --> 00:09:25,620

77
00:09:30,636 --> 00:09:31,432
I'm sorry, Sherry.

78
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,435
I didn't mean...

79
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:37,408
Just go to bed.

80
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,415

- Good night, Kim.

81
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,552

82

136

Nancy, you're not thinking logically.

137
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:41,284
We're fully prepared to handle
this situation within Talos.

138
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,344
But this situation
is out of control.

139
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:46,152
He's killed two people already
and now he's disappeared.

140
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,125
He couldn't have gotten
out of the complex.

141
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,059
He has to be somewhere
in the building.

142
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,563
I've got two men
searching for him right now.

143
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,599
I don't want him killed.

144
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,568
Elliot and I have devised a way
to get him back to normal.

145
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,604
I won't stand for it.
Do you hear me?

146
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:07,538
Sit down, Doctor.

147
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,721
<i>What would you have me do?</i>

148
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,780
Call in the police?

149
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,088
Or better yet,
the National Guard?

150
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,151
I'm not sure
they would share

151
00:14:23,229 --> 00:14:25,493
the compassion
and understanding

152
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,794
you feel for Dr. Foster.

153
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,428
<i>They don't share the same
romantic past as you and he.</i>

154
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,472
You saw what that
creature is capable of.

155
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,634
That creature is
still Michael Foster.

156
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,769
- I'm doing what I can.
- It's not enough, damn it!

157
00:14:39,845 --> 00:14:41,972
What about Elliot?
What about John Griffen?

158
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,605
What are you going
to do about them?

159
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,444
That has already
been taken care of.

160
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:58,660
You're a cold bastard.

161
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:02,734
(intercom buzzing)

162
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,274
Yes? Send them in.

163
00:15:17,449 --> 00:15:20,714
I'll ignore
that last remark, Doctor.

164
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:23,118
Now you know
as well as I that

165
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:26,351
this entire project has been
highly illegal from the start.

166
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,484
And you have been
a willing part of it.

167
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,427
I feel terrible about
what has happened.

168
00:15:31,497 --> 00:15:33,761
But we must keep
this within the family

169
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,791
or everything we've done
and learned will be for nothing.

170
00:15:40,172 --> 00:15:42,970
Michael Foster will be
worse off than he is now.

171
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:51,809
Please, trust me.

172
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:54,910
(knocking)

173
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,682
Come.

174
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,318
Mitchell, Jarrett,
this is Dr. Kane.

175
00:16:05,397 --> 00:16:08,025
Nancy, I think you'd better
explain to these gentlemen

176
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,727
exactly what's going on.

177
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,931
Um, Doctor, I don't think
we should explain...

178
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:16,236
It's all right, Doctor.
They've a level six clearance.

179
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,503
They answer
only to myself. Proceed.

180
00:16:22,614 --> 00:16:24,548
<i>As I'm sure you're aware,</i>

181
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:26,914
a number of research
and development programs here

182
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,386
at Talos are subsidized
by the government.

183
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,151
Some, how shall I say it...

184
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:37,691
do not exactly fall within
the safety guidelines and regulations

185
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:40,596
outlined and normally
enforced by the government,

186
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,193
particularly in the field
of nuclear research and genetics.

187
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,169
A few months ago,

188
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,173
Talos was assigned
a research grant

189
00:16:49,241 --> 00:16:53,143
by the Defense Department...
a very strange request.

190
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,373
We were given tissue samples,

191
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:57,677
alien tissue samples.

192
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,184
- Alien?
- Yes, alien.

193
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,186
<i>From another planet, apparently.</i>

194
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,789
We were skeptical ourselves.

195
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,986
They were vague, almost tight-lipped
about the sample's origin.

196
00:17:09,061 --> 00:17:11,359
Which led us to suspect
it was, in fact,

197
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,228
some genetically-altered
biological substance from Earth.

198
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,698
If that was the case,

199
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,236
why would they tell you it
came from another planet?

200
00:17:18,303 --> 00:17:21,932
We thought perhaps they developed
this material for biological warfare

201
00:17:22,007 --> 00:17:25,374
and were using Talos to test
what would be their alibi.

202
00:17:25,444 --> 00:17:27,275
This type of biological engineering

203
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,406
is expressly forbidden under
the UN germ warfare pact.

204
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:32,347
If they could fool
Talos into believing

205
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:35,285
that the origin of this material
was, in fact, from outer space,

206
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:37,049
<i>they could fool
anyone and avoid...</i>

207
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:39,920
Avoid indictment
for violation of the pact.

208
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:44,653
Exactly.

209
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:49,223
Unfortunately,
they were not lying.

210
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,403
<i>Dr. Michael Foster,</i>

211
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,570
<i>head of the entire genetic
research sector,</i>

212
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:02,136
<i>was put in charge...</i>

213
00:18:02,214 --> 00:18:04,478
<i>myself,
as Dr. Foster's assistant,</i>

214
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,984
<i>and Dr. Viallini being
the only three people</i>

215
00:18:07,052 --> 00:18:08,986
<i>with any knowledge
of the research.</i>

216
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,818
<i>Our problem
started on May 4th,</i>

217
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,688
<i>approximately 6:45 p.m.</i>

218
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,163
<i>Michael was working with some
cell cultures from the alien tissue.</i>

219
00:18:19,231 --> 00:18:22,530
(harpsichord music playing
on headphones)

220
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,630
Computer: <i>Containment seal secure,

221
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:47,919
- Guess who?
- Ahh!

222
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:52,297
Don't do that to me.

223
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:54,298
Don't tell me the doctor's
actually getting

224
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:57,096
- paranoid about his little monsters.
- (music shuts off)

225
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:59,660
You're a little monster.
Come here.

226
00:19:05,677 --> 00:19:08,544
Please, dear,
not in front of the mutants.

227
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:12,413
Computer:
<i>Cryo-interlock engaged.</i>

228
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,687
Are we still on
for dinner tonight?

229
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:20,949
I don't know what time
I'm going to be getting out of here.

230
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,505
Hello, Checkers.

231
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:39,301
Hello, baby.

232
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,345
Hello.

233
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,870
- (screams)
- (growling)

234
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:47,350
Well, Checkers is
certainly energetic today.

235
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:48,943
Mm-hmm.

236
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:51,114
Computer: <i>Intermediate microbe

- How far have you gotten?

238
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:59,054
Well, I'm introducing some of the alien
cell cultures into Spot's ovaries.

239
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,725
The problem is, I can't find
any plasmas in the alien cells.

240
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,859
There do not appear
to be any structures

241
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:06,302
that contain identifiable
genetic material.

242
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:09,898
<i>How can the cells replicate
if there's no genetic code?</i>

243
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:12,205
As far as I can tell,
the cells don't reproduce

244
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,245
by fission
as normal cells do.

245
00:20:14,313 --> 00:20:16,907
They seem to accumulate
polyp-like growths

246
00:20:16,982 --> 00:20:19,883
which just mass
together to form tissue.

247
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:22,580
I don't think even using
the term "cell" is applicable.

248
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,713
I tell you, Nancy, I'm stumped.

249
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,451
Well, you better get un-stumped.

250
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,993
Viallini wants a report
by the end of the week.

251
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,688
- Well, you can tell Viallini...
- Hey...

252
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,423
You can tell him
whatever you want.

253
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:33,896
I've got to go.

- Michael, that's sulfuric acid!

269
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,279
Damn it, don't argue with me!
Just do it!

270
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,075
Do you think that did it?

Elliot.
Dr. Elliot Stein?

283
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:40,920
Yes, Elliot...

284
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,516
Dr. Stein is
staff physician...

285
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,824
Dr. Elliot Stein:
Age 33;

286
00:22:44,896 --> 00:22:46,591
single; father dead;

287
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:49,600
mother still alive,
living in Chaplin, Nebraska;

288
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:52,296
graduate, Harvard Medical,
class of '77.

289
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,363
Stein is staff physician,
assistant to Dr. Marcus,

00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,738
head of pharmaceutical
and chemical research.

291
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,478
Yes, that Dr. Stein.

292
00:23:04,516 --> 00:23:06,416
May I continue?

293
00:23:07,652 --> 00:23:07,947
Thank God Elliot
was still there.

294
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:15,683
You know, I usually
don't make house calls.

295
00:23:16,762 --> 00:23:19,822
He was working on
one of the mutants and it bit him.

296
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,526
Michael, can you hear me?

297
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,327
Michael! Michael!

298
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,932
Elliot, he was working with some
really strange cell cultures.

299
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:33,041
They got into his...

00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:35,904
Holy Jesus.

What the hell was
he working with?

302
00:23:46,858 --> 00:23:49,383
Elliot, they were cell samples
from another planet.

303
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,564
What?!

304
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:56,567
The cells come from a creature
from another planet.

305
00:23:56,635 --> 00:23:58,159
Nancy, have you
been drinking?

306
00:23:58,236 --> 00:24:00,670
Elliot, don't argue with me.
I know it sounds crazy,

307
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:02,366
but it's true.
The cells come from a...

308
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,376
I don't have time to stand
here and explain this to you.

309
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,877
Just help him!

310
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,572
From another planet?

311
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,741
Elliot!

312
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:13,341
All right, all right.

313
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:17,114
Jesus Christ,
cells from outer space.

314
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,350

my name to Dr. McCoy.

315
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,055
Have you noticed any pods?

316
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,258
Elliot!

317
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,198
I'm sorry, it's just...

318
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:32,862
- I don't know where to start.

319
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:33,905
Elliot!

00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,496
<i>Elliot!</i>

321
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:38,469
Nancy, come here. Help me.

322
00:24:38,543 --> 00:24:40,101
Hold that in.

323
00:24:41,913 --> 00:24:43,813
You gotta hold him steady.
I'll give him a sedative.

324
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,930
(growling stops)

325
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:12,209
Help me get him up.
We've got to get him to a hospital.

326
00:25:14,579 --> 00:25:16,911
<i>That will not do,
Dr. Stein.</i>

327
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:20,247
Dr. Viallini, we've got
to get Michael to a hospital.

328
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,250
That won't be necessary, Doctor.

329
00:25:24,322 --> 00:25:27,587
We have the facilities here
to deal with this situation.

330
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,854
I don't mean to disagree, Doctor,

331
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,259
but this man has got to be...

332
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,355
Dr. Kane will explain to you
why it is imperative

333
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:36,161
that we deal with this problem

334
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:39,795
within the confines
of this establishment.

335
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:44,032
Nancy.

336
00:25:47,078 --> 00:25:50,013
Naturally, I explained the...

337
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,605
situation to Dr. Stein

338
00:25:51,683 --> 00:25:54,743
and he apparently agreed
that we should keep it...

339
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:56,753
in the family.

340
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:01,416
I'm sure whatever Dr. Viallini
is using to black...

341
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,961
was using to blackmail Elliot
is in that little folder of yours.

342
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,261
<i>That will be enough, Doctor.</i>

343
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,994
It is not enough, damn it.

344
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,730
You've had it in for Michael
ever since the ICV incident.

345
00:26:12,804 --> 00:26:14,567
- Dr. Kane...
- You've been waiting...

346
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:17,039
for an opportunity like this
to get rid of Michael

347
00:26:17,108 --> 00:26:21,010
so that he couldn't...
he's been looking for an excuse...

348
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:25,709
a few months back, Michael Foster
developed a retro-clonal virus...

349
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:28,116
a virus with the ability
to seek out

350
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,451
specific chromosomes
within certain organ cells.

351
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,991
This virus could have
been used to hunt down

352
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:36,721
and destroy malignantly
mutated genes.

353
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,660
Ultimately, it might
one day have rid

354
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,927
mankind of most
inheritable diseases.

355
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:46,627
Dr. Viallini had other plans.

356
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:48,639
Son of a bitch!

357
00:26:48,707 --> 00:26:51,608
You had no right to call
the Defense Department in on this one.

358
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:55,305
This is my project.
It's my work, my responsibility.

359
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,543
You are an employee
of the Talos Corporation.

360
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,608
Any materials you develop,

361
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,210
any research
you undertake is funded

362
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,381
by this corporation.

363
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,858
Hence, it is owned
solely by this corporation.

364
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:11,395
It is the board
of trustees who determine

365
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,921
when, where and to whom
we offer the results of our research.

366
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,197
Not some pig-headed
Ph.D. With delusions of...

367
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,931
- You incredible bastard!
- Michael.

368
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,236
We are not discussing
some secret recipe here.

369
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,936
We are talking about
a search-and-destroy virus

370
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:28,104
that could be perverted
and manipulated

371
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,670
to wipe out selected
populations of the human race!

372
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:34,276
- I will not be responsible!
- You're not that naive, Doctor,

373
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,979
nor that innocent.

374
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:38,113
You've taken a willing
part in many projects

375
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,680
whose objectives were
less than altruistic.

376
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,124
This is no different.

377
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,453
I'm not going to let you
get away with this.

378
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,158
I'll destroy all the data,
all the samples.

379
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:59,739
Do not make irrational threats
you'll be sorry for.

380
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,779
This is no threat.

381
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,814
I'll blow the whistle on you

382
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:06,146
and your little mutant
freak show downstairs.

383
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,584
I'm sure the National Genetic Council
would have a field day in this place.

384
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,680
Subpoenas will be flying around
here like a ticker-tape parade.

385
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:17,558
You are
just as much responsible.

386
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,325
You'll be cutting
your own throat.

387
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,829
I may go down, Doctor,

388
00:28:23,902 --> 00:28:27,804
but I swear to Christ,
I'll drag you with me.

389
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,304
You wouldn't.

390
00:28:34,312 --> 00:28:36,143
You want to play hardball?

391
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:38,182
You just try me.

392
00:28:38,249 --> 00:28:40,649
Michael. Michael!

393
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,112
He's a very stupid man.

394
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,158
I suggest
you speak with him,

395
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,628
set him straight,

396
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,495
before I'm forced to take
more drastic measures.

397
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,708
You're wasting
valuable time, Doctor.

398
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,572
Mr. Jarrett and Mr. Mitchell

399
00:29:05,643 --> 00:29:08,168
are not interested
in your accusations

400
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,407
or your fantasies.

401
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,575
They work for me.

402
00:29:18,389 --> 00:29:21,119
If any harm comes
to Michael Foster,

403
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:23,456
I will see to it personally

404
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:27,862
that the NGC strings
you up by the balls.

405
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:34,530
Mr. Mitchell
and Mr. Jarrett are waiting.

406
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,904
Please continue.

407
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:46,176
<i>Within hours, Michael's entire
body had been infected.</i>

408
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,515
(groaning)

409
00:29:48,586 --> 00:29:51,521
<i>Elliot set up the lab facilities
for treating Michael,</i>

410
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:53,648
<i>but the mutations
were too rapid,</i>

411
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:56,421
<i>and research led
only to dead ends.</i>

412
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,634
<i>As the days passed,</i>

413
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:05,794
<i>Michael changed even more,</i>

414
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:09,601
<i>as if his entire cellular
structure was being rearranged...</i>

415
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:12,199
<i>redefined by the alien tissue.</i>

416
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,785
Nancy, come here.
I'll need your help.

417
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:33,188
Hold that open
while I get a sample.

418
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,401
(screeches)

419
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,102
What the hell was that?

420
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:51,408
(screeching)

421
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,127
Elliot!

422
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:06,062
Are you trying to give me
a heart attack?

423
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,597
Stand back.

424
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:12,894
Come here,
you little son of a...

425
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,854
(screeching)

426
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:33,755
What in God's name
is that... thing?

427
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:36,817
I don't know, but I'm
not taking its temperature.

428
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,556
Look at this thing.

429
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,600
Jesus Christ!

430
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,797
Freakin' thing's
pissing on me.

431
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:53,003
<i>Elliot's theory was
not quite accurate.</i>

432
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,274
These small masses of flesh
contained a caustic venom,

433
00:31:56,347 --> 00:32:00,647
ejected through a hollow quill
in its mouth, I suppose.

434
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,380
But like a bumblebee, once
the stinger has spent its venom,

435
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,083
the mass dies and virtually
decomposes within minutes.

436
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,887
It is not a pleasant sight.

437
00:32:10,962 --> 00:32:12,930
(intercom buzzes)

438
00:32:12,997 --> 00:32:14,259
Yes?

439
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,926
Who?

440
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,099
I see.

441
00:32:22,707 --> 00:32:25,198
<i>Give me a moment
and then send her in.</i>

442
00:32:27,412 --> 00:32:29,380
Wait outside for a moment.

443
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:41,154
It appears that Officer Griffen's
daughter is here asking questions.

444
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:44,160
She hasn't seen
her father all day and she's...

445
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,458
Ah, Miss Griffen.

446
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,431
Come in.

447
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,399
I'd like you to meet
Dr. Nancy Kane.

448
00:32:53,471 --> 00:32:56,406
- Doctor, this is Stephanie.
- Sherry.

449
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,032
Hello, how do you do?

450
00:32:58,109 --> 00:33:01,203
Your father has talked
about you quite often, Sherry.

451
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,509
I understand you are
a very smart young lady.

452
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:06,948
You're studying
computers, is it?

453
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,317
Micro-circuit design
and engineering.

454
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:13,619
Very impressive.
Very impressive, indeed.

455
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,626
<i>When you graduate
I hope you come see me.</i>

456
00:33:16,694 --> 00:33:19,458
<i>I'm sure we can find
a spot here at Talos</i>

457
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:21,293
<i>for somebody
with your talents.</i>

458
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:22,958
Thank you, sir.

459
00:33:23,034 --> 00:33:24,695
I'd like to ask you
about my father.

460
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:28,637
Ah, yes? A fine man!

461
00:33:28,706 --> 00:33:31,834
One of our most trusted
and loyal employees.

462
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:34,400
Dr. Viallini...

463
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,175
my father's been gone
since last night.

464
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,375
<i>I haven't seen
or heard from him since.</i>

465
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,418
<i>I'm very worried.
It's not like him.</i>

466
00:33:42,787 --> 00:33:44,277
I see.

467
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,298
Well, according to our log...

468
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,698
your father didn't work
here last night.

469
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,567
<i>Wait. You mean
he wasn't here?</i>

470
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,766
<i>No, it says here
he called in sick.</i>

471
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,037
Yes.

472
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,600
That's confirmed.

473
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:10,704
Another security guard
is listed on his shift.

474
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:13,114
This is very strange.

475
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:16,813
It's not like him to leave
Kim and me without calling.

476
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,914
I wouldn't worry.

477
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,551
I'm sure there's
some explanation.

478
00:34:22,627 --> 00:34:24,595
I'll keep my ears open.

479
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:26,823
And if he doesn't
show up soon,

480
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,627
I'll personally see to it

481
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,963
that my people find out
where he is.

482
00:34:31,035 --> 00:34:33,560
Thank you so much
for stopping by.

483
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:35,538
Feel free to stop by anytime

484
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,234
you have a problem
we can help you with.

485
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,914
We may have trouble with her.

486
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:14,411
The question is,
where could it be hiding?

487
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:16,344
Where would it be hiding?

488
00:35:16,414 --> 00:35:19,178
I would appreciate it
if you would stop saying "it."

489
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,548
That is still Michael Foster,

490
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,416
no matter what
he's turned into.

491
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:26,719
I'm sorry, Doctor,
I forgot how close you two were.

492
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:30,124
Well, when I saw him last

493
00:35:30,194 --> 00:35:32,560
he looked pretty slimy.

494
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:36,964
He'd begun to resemble
some sort of garden bug

495
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:40,162
or slug, or leach.

496
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,907
(groaning)

497
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:01,588
<i>(groaning continues)</i>

498
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:40,423
<i>Dr. Stein!</i>

499
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,771
Thank you,
very much, Doctors.

500
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,310
Now would either one of you
care to retrieve my probe,

501
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,938
or shall I just take
a reimbursement out of petty cash?

502
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,208
Elliot!

503
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,677
This is no time for levity.

504
00:37:07,291 --> 00:37:10,317
(screaming)

505
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:21,201
Ta-da!

506
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:22,466
For my next trick...

507
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:27,935
<i>By this time, even his internal
physiology had transformed.</i>

508
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:30,742
<i>His blood became
highly caustic,</i>

509
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:34,581
<i>his heart enlarged
by nearly twice its original size,</i>

510
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:38,019
<i>and he was becoming
less and less responsive</i>

511
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,556
<i>to the medications.</i>

512
00:37:45,229 --> 00:37:48,323
<i>Finally, after four weeks
of dead ends,</i>

513
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,027
<i>Elliot made
a major breakthrough.</i>

<i>RNA factor:

526

Take a look.

527
00:41:07,331 --> 00:41:09,458
A few minutes ago that sample

528
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,161
was completely infected
by the alien cells.

529
00:41:12,236 --> 00:41:14,670
But this shows
no sign of infection.

530
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,798
- Thank you very much.
- Elliot, you're wonderful!

531
00:41:17,875 --> 00:41:19,672
Yes, I know.

532
00:41:19,743 --> 00:41:21,472
How did you do it?

533
00:41:21,545 --> 00:41:23,240
<i>Elementary, my dear.</i>

534
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,305
I'd been noticing strange
molecular behavior

535
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,283
whenever I exposed samples
through the electron microscope.

536
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:30,513
The reaction
to negative pulse phasing

537
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,920
caused rampant destabilization
of the molecular bonding,

538
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,356
but only at specific
wavelengths.

539
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:38,725
As it turns out,
cellular and biological activity

540
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,765
is halted for a period of time
when electricity is introduced.

541
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,531
I can't be that simple.

542
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,434
You've received
total remission.

543
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,099
When his heart
stopped, we gave him

544
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,507
electro-shock resuscitation...
it did nothing.

545
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:55,772
You're talking about
normal AC current.

546
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,643
You got two problems there.

547
00:41:57,715 --> 00:41:59,910
One, there's no way
to control or focus it

548
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,747
at specific enough
wavelengths.

549
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,219
Secondly, the amount
of energy required

550
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:09,021
to stop and reverse Michael's
metamorphosis would fry him.

551
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,519
Well?

552
00:42:14,431 --> 00:42:15,420
Well, what?

553
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:17,592
Well, how did you manage it?

554
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:19,693
- Wow!
- Elliot!

555
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,707
I, uh...

556
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,366
I borrowed this little machine

557
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:27,569
from the boys down
in particle acceleration.

558
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:29,272
- An atom smasher?
- That's right.

559
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,746
But it's not atom smashing
I'm interested in.

560
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,080
You see, the particles are accelerated
through a series of electromagnets.

561
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,144
As they travel and build up speed
around its curved course,

562
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,849
electrons fly off, sort of like

563
00:42:39,924 --> 00:42:42,722
tires screeching when
you take a turn very fast.

564
00:42:42,793 --> 00:42:47,059
But these electrons can be focused
and manipulated to any wavelength.

565
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:49,224
So, I can control the output.

566
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:51,291
And this way we can
reverse the process

567
00:42:51,368 --> 00:42:52,892
and still keep
Michael alive.

568
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:56,135
That's what
I'm hoping for, yeah.

569
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,367
Well what are we waiting for?
Come on, let's give it a try.

570
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,376
Nancy, hold on. Calm down.

571
00:43:00,444 --> 00:43:02,412
I still need to do
a few more tests.

572
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,846
Besides, this machine isn't nearly
powerful enough to do the job.

573
00:43:05,916 --> 00:43:07,611
We can use Agnes.

574
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,243
<i>My thinking exactly.</i>

575
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:13,017
A cyclotron the size of Agnes will
put out 10 times the power we need.

576
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,217
We'll have to construct a terminal

577
00:43:15,292 --> 00:43:17,760
in a room nearby
the accelerator tunnel.

578
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,353
Let's schedule the first test
next week sometime.

579
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,729
If we can keep Michael
alive until then...

580
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,792
I'll talk to Viallini right away.
Tell me exactly what's required,

581
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,359
and I'll have him
take care of it.

582
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,871
The particles
are accelerated...

583
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,998
<i>Within a week the terminal
was constructed.</i>

584
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:34,010
We called it
the atomic shotgun.

585
00:43:34,078 --> 00:43:35,909
Let me see that.

586
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:40,144
Agnes, this cyclotron,
it's never been tested?

587
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:42,811
Construction has only
just been completed.

588
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:45,753
We expect a full-power
test firing tonight in...

589
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:48,314
less than six hours,
as a matter of fact.

590
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:51,020
And the engineers,
they have no knowledge

591
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,756
of this shotgun's purpose?

592
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:56,322
Only the four of us
in this room.

593
00:43:58,669 --> 00:44:00,603
<i>Go on, Doctor.</i>

594
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:04,004
<i>Michael's transformation
continued</i>

595
00:44:04,074 --> 00:44:07,043
<i>while we conducted more
tests preparing for tonight...</i>

596
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,373
<i>unfortunately.</i>

597
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:21,286

604
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,296
Nancy, I think
he wants to talk to you.

605
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,340
What?

606
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,568

609
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,453
Elliot, do something!

610
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:36,792
Oh my God.

611
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:40,633
- (screeching)
- (mutants growling)

612
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,878
You better get Viallini.
We can't wait until tomorrow.

613
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:53,712
We gotta fire up Agnes now.

614
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,118
Nancy, go now! Find Viallini.

615
00:45:57,187 --> 00:46:00,281
And get right back here... I'm gonna
need help getting Michael downstairs.

616
00:46:26,884 --> 00:46:29,648
(flatlines)

617
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:18,626
(screaming)

618
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:23,230
Doctor, it's Michael.

619
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,206

620
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:33,105

629
00:48:30,107 --> 00:48:32,075
And this was last night?

630
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:35,704
Last night, early this morning.

631
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,206
So, you really have no idea
what this thing looks like.

632
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:42,980
My God, it doesn't
matter what he looks like.

633
00:48:46,089 --> 00:48:47,886
Believe me,

634
00:48:47,958 --> 00:48:51,758
there will be no doubt
in your mind when you see him.

635
00:48:54,865 --> 00:48:56,992
Sherry, you're
acting ridiculous.

636
00:48:57,067 --> 00:48:58,500
You are really paranoid.

637
00:48:58,568 --> 00:49:01,264
He was lying to me.
He told me my father never even

638
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:03,898
showed up for work last night,
that he called in sick.

639
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:06,943
All right, all right,
so maybe your father did call in sick.

640
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,205
Maybe he had other plans,

641
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,406
personal plans that Viallini
wouldn't let him off work for.

642
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:12,971
He would have told me.

643
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,348
He would never leave Kim
and me this long without calling.

644
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,115
Maybe he did call.
You've been gone all day.

645
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,352
You're leaving the room.

646
00:49:27,164 --> 00:49:29,530
I didn't even think about
the answering machine.

647
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,760
I just got it
a few days ago.

648
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,065
Answering machine:
<i>Hi, handsome.</i>

649
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,129
<i>I just wanted to make sure
you're still going to stop by.</i>

650
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:39,334
<i>I've got the martinis chilling.</i>

651
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:41,104
<i>I'll be waiting. Ciao.</i>

652
00:49:41,178 --> 00:49:43,703
See, what did I tell you?
Your father probably got lucky...

653
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,747
Shh!

654
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:48,512
<i>Hi, honey. I guess
you're still at the movies.</i>

655
00:49:48,585 --> 00:49:52,043
<i>I stopped off at Susan's
for a drink before work.</i>

656
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,613
<i>I left my ID pass at home.</i>

657
00:49:54,691 --> 00:49:56,818
<i>I was going
to ask you to bring it.</i>

658
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,453
<i>Don't worry about it.
I'll use Jerry's pass tonight.</i>

659
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:01,997
<i>I'm running late.
Gotta get to work.</i>

660
00:50:02,065 --> 00:50:04,590
<i>Make sure Kim
gets to bed early.</i>

661
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,101
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

662
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,330
<i>I love you.</i>

663
00:50:10,707 --> 00:50:12,538
They've got him.

664
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,702
They're holding him there.

665
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,473
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

666
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,709
He's been telling me about all the weird
things going on at that place.

667
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,250
Now they've got him.

668
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,411
Don't you think you're
being a little ridiculous?

669
00:50:23,487 --> 00:50:25,250
He said he wanted to quit,

670
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,847
that they were making him nervous
with all the dangerous experiments

671
00:50:27,924 --> 00:50:30,757
they've been doing
on animals and stuff.

672
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:33,091
They're probably
experimenting on him.

673
00:50:33,163 --> 00:50:36,223
Sherry, Sherry, this is absurd.
Calm down.

674
00:50:36,299 --> 00:50:37,823
Do you hear
what you're saying?

675
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:39,732
They don't do
experiments on people.

676
00:50:41,104 --> 00:50:44,130
- I'm going out there.
- Out where?

677
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:46,433
Sherry!

678
00:50:49,846 --> 00:50:52,974
Sherry, will you slow down a minute?
You're not thinking straight.

679
00:50:54,451 --> 00:50:55,418
Hey, dude.

680
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,112
<i>Where are you all off to?</i>

681
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:58,882
Have you heard from Daddy yet?

682
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:00,388
<i>They've got him.
I'm sure of it.</i>

683
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,118
<i>God knows what
they're doing to him.</i>

684
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,025
Sherry, stop it.
You're going to scare Kim.

685
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,655
<i>What's going on, Sherry?
Where's Dad?</i>

686
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,892
We're gonna go find him.
He may be in trouble.

687
00:51:09,966 --> 00:51:12,093
We don't know that, Sherry.

688
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,637
Kim, I want you to stay here.
He might call.

689
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:17,070
Screw that!
I'm going with you.

690
00:51:17,140 --> 00:51:18,471
You're not going anywhere.

691
00:51:18,542 --> 00:51:20,533
Someone's got to stay here
in case he calls.

692
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:21,975
Besides,
you'd never get in there.

693
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:23,672
<i>You wanna bet?</i>

694
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,011
Don't argue with me, Kim.
Just stay here.

695
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,382
- Screw you, Sherry.
- Sherry...

696
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:30,920
- Here, put this on.
- For what?

697
00:51:30,987 --> 00:51:33,251
Do you think we're going to get in
because of these white coats?

You heard what he said, the place
