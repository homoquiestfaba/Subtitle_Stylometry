1
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,179
My husband, he's trapped in the car.

2
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,213
You have to help me.

3
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,379
All right, but your daughter stays here.

4
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,200
She's not safe in the forest.

5
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,309
Stay here, sweetie,
don't go outside, okay?

6
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,663
Stay right here.

7
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:25,953
Don't open the door.

8
00:03:37,462 --> 00:03:38,462
Hello?

9
00:04:17,301 --> 00:04:19,634
Get us out of here!

10
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,242
Hurry!
Listen very carefully.

11
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:27,019
When you wake up, run
east through the woods

12
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,106
until you find a cabin.
My daughter, my daughter.

13
00:04:29,107 --> 00:04:31,026
My daughter, I can't...
Untie us!

14
00:04:31,027 --> 00:04:32,689
It took her, it took her.

15
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,879
Is she okay?
She's fine,

16
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,179
she's back at the cabin.

17
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,109
Remember...
What the hell

18
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,369
are you talking about?
Run east into the woods

19
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:38,673
away from the road!

20
00:04:38,674 --> 00:04:39,674
No!

21
00:05:16,114 --> 00:05:18,614
Julie, Julie?

22
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:19,689
What happened?

23
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:20,690
Where's Julie?

24
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,726
She said Julie is at a
cabin, away from the road.

25
00:05:25,727 --> 00:05:27,060
Come on, Jeff.

26
00:05:29,575 --> 00:05:30,575
Wait!

27
00:06:26,268 --> 00:06:27,468
All right, get inside.

28
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:34,733
Who the hell are you?

29
00:06:34,734 --> 00:06:36,029
Oh, I just, I crashed my bike...

30
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,219
I didn't see you out there.

31
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,359
Don't shoot, I'm just
looking for a phone.

32
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,099
How do I know you're not one of them?

33
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,309
How do I know you're not one of them?

34
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,759
I don't know what you're
talking about, really, I don't.

35
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,049
I just, I just crashed my bike.

36
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,509
- All right, get inside.
- No, that's okay,

37
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,343
I'll just go find some...

38
00:06:50,344 --> 00:06:51,639
You'll die if you stay out here.

39
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,033
Get inside, now.

40
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,870
Go, go!

41
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,620
- What's out there?
- Just don't let them in.

42
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,690
Stop.

43
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,409
What's your name?

44
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:42,350
Haley.

45
00:07:42,351 --> 00:07:44,859
It's the light that keeps
them out, Haley, not the house.

46
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,173
We want as much light
shining out as we can.

47
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:48,906
What?

48
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,279
Just do me a favor and sit over there.

49
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,983
- But I...
- Sit down now.

50
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,259
Julie?

51
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,039
Julie, this isn't funny!

52
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,389
Get out here right now!

53
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,899
Where's our daughter?

54
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,279
I'm sorry, she's not here.

55
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,113
What do you mean, she's not here?

56
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,929
You said that you brought her here!

57
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:05,259
The door was open when I came back,

58
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,706
she must have gone to look for you.

59
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:09,059
- Julie?
- Stay away from that door.

60
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,289
It's Daddy.

61
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,399
Open this door right now.

62
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,959
- Get away from the door!
- Julie, sweetie,

63
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,719
open up so we can go home.

64
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,229
Get away from the fucking door!

65
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,699
Why is she in there, please?

66
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,249
She's not in there!

67
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,409
Look, that door has been
locked the whole time.

68
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,519
There is no way she got in there.

69
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,829
I told you the front door
was open when I got back.

70
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,239
She must have gone to look for you.

71
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,749
Then we have to go find her.

72
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,079
You go out there, you won't come back.

73
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,949
- Wait, Jeff, maybe...
- Look, I'm sorry.

74
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,949
Your daughter's gone, stay inside.

75
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,549
Maybe you guys should
just listen to her.

76
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,819
No.

77
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,269
We have to go get her, now.

78
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,466
- Jeff, wait.
- No!

79
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:51,257
Julie!

80
00:08:53,168 --> 00:08:54,168
Julie!

81
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,883
Jeff?

82
00:09:01,884 --> 00:09:03,018
Close the door.

83
00:10:12,985 --> 00:10:14,333
Is she gonna be okay?

84
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,513
She's in shock.

85
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,010
But she's asleep for now.

86
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,059
Well, maybe when it's late out,

87
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,110
you and I can go look for their daughter.

88
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,490
Since I've been here,

89
00:10:26,555 --> 00:10:28,983
I've seen a lot of people
get caught out in the dark.

90
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,950
Haven't seen any of them again.

91
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:34,823
Well, what's in that room?

92
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,160
Don't worry about it.

93
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Have a seat.

94
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,063
So tell me some things, Haley.

95
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,723
Like how you got here,
your job, your middle name.

96
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,359
Name of the first boy you kissed.

97
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,360
Why?

98
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:59,559
Because I've never
seen one of those things

99
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,279
imitate a person before,

100
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,530
and I'm not convinced
you're not one of them.

101
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:05,710
But you...

102
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:09,013
Okay, I don't have a middle name.

103
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:11,539
I know that sounds fake,

104
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,309
but my parents just thought
they were stupid or something,

105
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:17,049
and I'm a grad student at CU,

106
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,253
and I live off of student loans.

107
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:24,109
The name of the first boy
I ever kissed was Eli.

108
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,219
He was in 8th grade
and I was in 7th grade,

109
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,629
and he dumped me two weeks later,

110
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,323
'cause he said the mystery was gone.

111
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,733
Is that good enough?

112
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,153
How'd you get here?

113
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:51,559
I was riding my bike along the road,

114
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,369
and this car came up around the bend,

115
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,539
and there was some sort of explosion,

116
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:59,779
and I couldn't control my
bike, and it went off the road.

117
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,623
But when I came back up, there was a wall?

118
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,230
What the hell is going on here?

119
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,019
It's a cage.

120
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,520
It runs around the whole area.

121
00:12:14,966 --> 00:12:17,833
And I don't know what those things are.

122
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:24,133
All I know is that basically,
it's like we're dead already.

123
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,034
What?

124
00:12:28,035 --> 00:12:29,919
What do you mean?

125
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,929
You can die 100 times
here, doesn't matter.

126
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,223
You just wake up where you started.

127
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,413
Where you started?

128
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,180
Where you died for the first time.

129
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,370
Where the cage killed you.

130
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,619
So you just come back to life?

131
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,787
I mean, that's...

132
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,223
How long have you been here?

133
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:03,289
I don't know.

134
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,290
Months, maybe.

135
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:08,719
So we're just stuck here?

136
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,799
There has to be a way out.

137
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,693
Well, if there is, I
haven't found it yet.

138
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,113
Believe me, I've tried.

139
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,913
So we just sit here forever?

140
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,060
Not forever.

141
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:28,593
The generator will run out of gas.

142
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,660
Or the light bulbs will burn out.

143
00:13:34,883 --> 00:13:36,583
And then we'll run out of candles.

144
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,979
I don't think the lures will
wait for any of that to happen.

145
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
The lures?

146
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,780
That's what I call them.

147
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,813
The daylight things.

148
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,463
They try to lure you out
so they can trap you.

149
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,283
They used to just whisper.

150
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:01,023
You couldn't even see them,

151
00:14:01,024 --> 00:14:02,663
it was like they were in the air.

152
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,110
Then they started to call out.

153
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,053
Yelling, screaming.

154
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
Like children.

155
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:19,280
And you could see them.

156
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,263
Faces in the earth, in the shadows.

157
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Their hands.

158
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,123
They started to take people.

159
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:38,533
Pull them down, cover their
mouths so they couldn't scream.

160
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,423
Then somehow they learned words.

161
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:50,083
Like they were listening to us, to me.

162
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:53,960
And they learned my name.

163
00:14:56,170 --> 00:14:58,763
They'd whisper my name from the trees,

164
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,720
before they buried
themselves in the ground.

165
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:10,713
But they never looked human until today.

166
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,360
What happens when they trap you?

167
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:27,100
From what I've seen,
they don't hurt you.

168
00:15:28,987 --> 00:15:33,230
They just tie you up,
pull you into the ground,

169
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,923
keep you there for the night things.

170
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,373
Like they're servants or something.

171
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,540
And when the night things take you,

172
00:15:48,174 --> 00:15:49,174
you don't come back.

173
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,319
Well I'm not waiting around.

174
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,046
When it's light out, I'm gonna
go out and find a way out.

175
00:15:58,047 --> 00:15:59,809
I told you there's no way...

176
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:01,119
Well I'd rather die
looking for a way out

177
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,789
than just wait here for
them to come and get me.

178
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:05,280
Do what you want.

179
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,619
In the morning I'm gonna
siphon the gas from their car

180
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,020
to keep the generator going.

181
00:16:36,194 --> 00:16:38,861
You mind telling me your name?

182
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,533
Alex.

183
00:16:43,505 --> 00:16:45,773
Well, Alexis, really.

184
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,133
A guy really dumped you

185
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:59,083
because he thought the mystery was gone?

186
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,410
Yeah.

187
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:08,070
In 8th grade?

188
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah.

189
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:15,616
Hm.

190
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:56,644
Must record all
of this before I forget.

191
00:17:56,645 --> 00:17:57,498
Working on the machine,

192
00:17:57,499 --> 00:18:00,248
its concepts are beyond
anything I've seen.

193
00:18:01,767 --> 00:18:02,973
Memories out of my head.

194
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,223
Reynolds led a team of us to Mexico.

195
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:16,899
We were looking for an
indented area in the jungle.

196
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,959
Like a crater, like on a satellite image.

197
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,339
We dated the impact to 10 million B.C.

198
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,971
The center was an ancient Maya ruin.

199
00:18:26,478 --> 00:18:27,478
That gave us...

200
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,563
We set up camp near the ruin.

201
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:37,163
We dated it 8850.

202
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,459
It must have been one
of the last to be built,

203
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,731
since the Maya started to
disappear right around that time.

204
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,073
Creates a dark matter matrix.

205
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,569
How they learned to control
it, much less discover it,

206
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:03,393
I don't know, but that's
how they opened the door.

207
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,249
That's how they got here.

208
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,899
What the hell are you doing?

209
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,655
I'm sorry, I didn't wanna wake you up,

210
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:13,629
but I've never seen anything like this.

211
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:15,066
It's like some kind of machine, you know?

212
00:19:15,067 --> 00:19:17,189
And you have this core device here,

213
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,399
which is connected to
these platform devices.

214
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,039
Three of them, right?

215
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,799
And they're basically capacitors,

216
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,729
but not capacitors for
anything I've ever seen.

217
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,229
So when the core is fully charged,

218
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,399
it transmits the power to the capacitors.

219
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,513
But why I haven't figured out yet.

220
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,459
This thing is incredible.

221
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,329
How come I've never heard of it before?

222
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:38,423
Who was this guy?

223
00:19:40,912 --> 00:19:42,329
My grandfather.

224
00:19:43,295 --> 00:19:44,532
What?

225
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,513
This is my grandfather's cabin.

226
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:09,422
This is it.

227
00:20:09,423 --> 00:20:11,003
This is why we're here.

228
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,403
Don't touch it.

229
00:20:25,818 --> 00:20:30,818
He said they didn't find
anything down there, in Mexico.

230
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,680
He was down there for over a year.

231
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,643
Sending us letters and pictures.

232
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,689
Justine would run to the mailbox every day

233
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,539
to see if he'd sent us something.

234
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
Justine?

235
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:43,868
My little sister.

236
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,559
She'd make us all sit in the living room

237
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,173
while she stood on a chair,
read the letter to us.

238
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,313
It was all pretty exciting
until the letters stopped.

239
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,923
When he finally did come
back, he was different.

240
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,173
He had this crazy look in his eyes.

241
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,890
Then he just disappeared.

242
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,139
He didn't tell the
university he was quitting,

243
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,990
or tell any of us where he was going.

244
00:21:17,769 --> 00:21:19,039
And you found him up here?

245
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,419
No.

246
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:23,803
He called us just out of
the blue 15 years later.

247
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:28,169
Justine and I were living in
our mom's house since she died.

248
00:21:28,170 --> 00:21:29,620
We'd all thought he was dead.

249
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,546
He just said, "Alex, come up here.

250
00:21:33,547 --> 00:21:35,177
"I have it, I have it."

251
00:21:36,827 --> 00:21:39,849
And he kept saying he needed Justine, too.

252
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,850
He needed two.

253
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:43,116
I don't know what he meant.

254
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:49,559
I didn't wanna bring her up here.

255
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,760
I told her to stay home.

256
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:54,507
But she wanted to see him.

257
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,220
You don't tell everyone
all that, do you?

258
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:08,576
No.

259
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,494
So why'd you tell me?

260
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,729
You're the first person to come here

261
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,683
who understands any of those diagrams.

262
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,290
Maybe you can get us out.

263
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:33,613
- Dark matter.
- What?

264
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,419
On the tape your grandfather
mentioned dark matter.

265
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,369
It actually makes up most of
the matter in the universe,

266
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,829
but because it's invisible
and doesn't react

267
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,149
with normal matter, no one
really knows what it is.

268
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,550
What are you, a physicist?

269
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,463
Yeah, I'm a graduate physics student.

270
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,069
I interned at Fermilab last year,

271
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,609
and Alex, I gotta tell you,
these diagrams look a lot

272
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,849
like the diagrams for
the particle accelerator.

273
00:22:57,850 --> 00:23:00,929
Only much smaller, and simpler,

274
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:04,323
and not for any particles I've ever seen.

275
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,189
I don't know about this part
of it, but the three platform...

276
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:09,319
They generate the barrier, I think.

277
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,459
There's one right next
to it up near the road.

278
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,313
I tried destroying it, but I
couldn't do anything to it.

279
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,829
See, most accelerators have to be built

280
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:19,209
in a big, circular underground tunnel

281
00:23:19,210 --> 00:23:21,027
so that the particles
don't run into things,

282
00:23:21,028 --> 00:23:23,309
but dark matter, it doesn't
react to normal matter.

283
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,759
You could build it right out
in the middle of nowhere.

284
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,209
If we can deactivate them,
maybe even just one of them,

285
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,209
maybe it'll bring us
back to the normal world.

286
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,629
I told you, I tried that already.

287
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,519
Not destroy them, deactivate them.

288
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,520
How?

289
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,660
I don't know.

290
00:23:43,569 --> 00:23:45,369
But Alex, your grandfather
couldn't have built this.

291
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:48,769
I mean, the technology
is, it's impossible.

292
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:50,369
The power source, I mean, you'd need...

293
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,669
I don't think he did build it,

294
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,719
I think he just fixed
something he found down there

295
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,922
a long time ago.

296
00:23:55,923 --> 00:23:57,949
Well if I'm gonna figure it out,

297
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:00,000
you're gonna have to show me one of them.

298
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:35,755
I'll unlock it.

299
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,609
So where'd you learn to do this?

300
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,610
Boyfriend.

301
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,119
Where is he now, do you
think he's looking for you?

302
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,690
I doubt it, that was in the 5th grade.

303
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:44,332
Alex, I think...

304
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:45,333
Alex!

305
00:28:09,462 --> 00:28:10,800
Damn it, Haley, where the hell were you?

306
00:28:10,801 --> 00:28:12,360
You were supposed to
be keeping an eye out!

307
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:13,787
Well maybe you should've told me that.

308
00:28:13,788 --> 00:28:14,621
What?

309
00:28:14,622 --> 00:28:15,821
We needed that gas, Haley!

310
00:28:15,822 --> 00:28:17,449
What are we supposed to do now?

311
00:28:17,450 --> 00:28:19,089
The generator's not
gonna last much longer!

312
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:20,732
Look, I'm sorry, okay, but
I found one of those machines,

313
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:22,051
it's right up here.

314
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:23,719
All right, let's go.

315
00:28:54,506 --> 00:28:55,506
A switch.

316
00:29:27,829 --> 00:29:28,662
I don't think this thing

317
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:30,079
has anything to do with the barrier.

318
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,678
Why not?

319
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,523
Because I just turned it on.

320
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,919
The switch has to be some
sort of circuit breaker,

321
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,079
which means it was off before.

322
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,249
Just must've gotten tripped up

323
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,949
during the original activation.

324
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,500
What does it do, then?

325
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,438
I don't know.

326
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:49,842
Let me look at the drawings again.

327
00:29:49,843 --> 00:29:52,649
I need two people for each trip.

328
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:55,763
One to get me there, one to get me back.

329
00:29:58,198 --> 00:30:00,799
But it will not work
with anything not human.

330
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,439
I tried using a raccoon I caught,

331
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,529
but the machine couldn't
draw enough power on it

332
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,399
to activate the matrix.

333
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,339
The forest creature that
I brought back with me,

334
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,623
it didn't work, either.

335
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,199
Forest creatures.

336
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,139
Maybe because it's
a dark matter life form.

337
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,140
Oh, the lures.

338
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,529
The method by which the machine

339
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,423
transforms life energy into
power is still a mystery to me.

340
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,323
But if I didn't know better,

341
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:29,163
I'd say the thing is fueled by souls.

342
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,083
One thing's for sure.

343
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,313
The machine's influence is corrupting.

344
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,993
It's already made me into a murderer.

345
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,869
She's still asleep.

346
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:44,810
I only hope it doesn't make me

347
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:45,993
into something worse.

348
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,769
You've listened to
this whole tape, right?

349
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,369
Yeah.

350
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,819
Does he say anything
about reversing the fields,

351
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,149
or anything?

352
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:59,053
I need to know how this is
wired so I don't blow us up.

353
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:06,610
Doorways.

354
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:09,749
I don't know if it helps,

355
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:12,313
but he said it would open doorways.

356
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,749
Doorways?

357
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:17,799
In some of his letters,
he talked about doorways

358
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,189
to other worlds.

359
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:21,309
We all thought he was crazy.

360
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,310
Doorways.

361
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,629
On the tape, your grandfather
mentioned something

362
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:29,113
about needing two people for every trip.

363
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:31,640
Does that mean anything to you?

364
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Yes.

365
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,223
Justine and me.

366
00:31:39,876 --> 00:31:42,126
We were the ones he needed.

367
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,783
Justine, Justine!

368
00:32:34,007 --> 00:32:36,325
No, Justine!

369
00:32:36,326 --> 00:32:37,909
Justine, no!

370
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,160
What happened to her?

371
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,190
She died.

372
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,890
She didn't come back like the others.

373
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,930
That's when all this...

374
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:01,375
I'm sorry.

375
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:22,183
Wait, you said you pulled your
sister away from it, right?

376
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,349
What if it wasn't done yet?

377
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,900
What if interrupting it is
what caused all of this?

378
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,599
I wonder if that's what
he meant by doorways.

379
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,009
This things transports you to other worlds

380
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,309
or dimensions or something,

381
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,669
but you stopped it from
completing the journey.

382
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:39,149
What if there's not even
a barrier out there,

383
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,699
just a place where the two
worlds don't fit together?

384
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,449
How does that help us?

385
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:46,499
Because if it can transport you one way,

386
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,549
it can transport you back.

387
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:50,679
What if we start it up again,
but don't interrupt it?

388
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,939
If I can reprogram it, maybe
it'll get us out of this,

389
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:54,820
return things to normal.

390
00:33:54,821 --> 00:33:56,023
Don't you get it?

391
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,784
It killed her.

392
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:00,509
It used her like a fucking battery.

393
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,669
Do you wanna volunteer for that?

394
00:34:01,670 --> 00:34:02,859
What I'm saying is
maybe it wouldn't have

395
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,573
if you hadn't stopped it.

396
00:34:04,574 --> 00:34:05,574
I had to.

397
00:34:24,789 --> 00:34:27,956
The sun isn't supposed to go down yet.

398
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,206
What are you talking about?

399
00:34:31,207 --> 00:34:33,789
You mean it's setting sooner
than it's supposed to?

400
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:34,790
Yes.

401
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
How much sooner?

402
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:39,980
Three hours and 15 minutes.

403
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:51,442
Mommy.

404
00:34:53,714 --> 00:34:55,464
Mommy.

405
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,759
Mommy, he wants you!

406
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,309
Who does, sweetie?

407
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,310
Is it Daddy?

408
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,889
Yes, Daddy.

409
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,983
Let's go free Daddy.

410
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,673
Come open the door, Mommy.

411
00:36:04,281 --> 00:36:06,139
Come on, Mommy.

412
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,140
Daddy's hungry.

413
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,120
Tracy, no!

414
00:36:16,589 --> 00:36:17,589
Tracy!

415
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,949
She won't come back, will she?

416
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:15,950
Like her husband.

417
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
No.

418
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,430
When the night things take you.

419
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,459
The lures have always
been afraid of the dark.

420
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:26,710
Yeah, well not anymore.

421
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,259
Yeah.

422
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,010
They're getting smarter and bolder.

423
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:33,540
The days are getting shorter.

424
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,860
Sounds like we're running
out of time, Alex.

425
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,739
Okay, these things are arranged
in an equilateral triangle.

426
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:53,173
The car crash was right about here.

427
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:59,939
So over there, which
means if we move roughly

428
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,379
in this direction, we
can find the second one.

429
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,340
Yeah, that sounds right.

430
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:07,907
And then just follow the
barrier to the third one.

431
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,893
We should be able to
find it pretty easily.

432
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,459
I think I can figure out how to reverse it

433
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,109
from your grandfather's
notes and recordings.

434
00:38:16,110 --> 00:38:17,369
Maybe it'll get us out of this, you know,

435
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,820
return things back to normal.

436
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,550
If we can get power to the machine.

437
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:26,393
Well maybe someone else will come.

438
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:29,433
We just murder someone?

439
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,273
Alex, I've been trying

440
00:38:31,273 --> 00:38:32,250
to tell you...
Yeah, that maybe

441
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:34,699
it doesn't kill you if
you don't interrupt it.

442
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:36,429
Do you wanna take that
chance with someone?

443
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,280
Well, maybe someone will volunteer.

444
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,079
Let's just not think
about it right now, okay?

445
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,749
Tomorrow morning we'll go out,

446
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:43,959
we'll turn on the other two machines,

447
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,610
and then we'll just figure
out what to do after that.

448
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,500
That's where they come from.

449
00:38:55,802 --> 00:38:56,802
What?

450
00:38:58,173 --> 00:39:00,690
You said the third
machine was over there.

451
00:39:02,642 --> 00:39:05,103
That's where the night things come from.

452
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,610
Alex?

453
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,754
Damn it, Alex.

454
00:41:40,003 --> 00:41:41,779
What were you doing out there alone?

455
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,749
I was getting the gas, which
I wouldn't have had to do

456
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:45,479
if you hadn't screwed up yesterday.

457
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,313
I'm sorry.

458
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:47,290
Why did you even come after me?

459
00:41:47,291 --> 00:41:48,649
You probably left the cabin unlocked.

460
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:50,239
I'm not stupid, Alex, all right?

461
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,949
Look, I'm just trying
to get us out of here,

462
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:53,579
but I can't do that alone.

463
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,269
Why didn't you ask me to go with you?

464
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:56,150
You didn't wanna go.

465
00:41:56,151 --> 00:41:58,113
Oh come on, Alex, I would've gone.

466
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,949
Look, I know you've been here a long time,

467
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:05,359
and you're used to doing
things your own way.

468
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,569
But we're never gonna get out of here

469
00:42:06,570 --> 00:42:08,320
if we don't start working together.

470
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:15,983
We have enough time to go turn
on the other two machines?

471
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:21,619
Couple hours, unless
today gets even shorter.

472
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:24,039
Then God knows how much time we have.

473
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,430
Your sister.

474
00:43:05,641 --> 00:43:07,889
What was your sister like?

475
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:11,963
Friendly, smart,
arrogant, kind of like you.

476
00:43:12,961 --> 00:43:14,559
That's why my last boyfriend dumped me.

477
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:16,129
For being arrogant?

478
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,589
No, for being smart.

479
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:18,679
How did you end up with a guy

480
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,130
who doesn't like smart girls?

481
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,250
Because I'm stupid.

482
00:43:23,450 --> 00:43:24,843
What about the other grave?

483
00:43:26,130 --> 00:43:27,130
My grandfather.

484
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,620
The machine killed him, too?

485
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:36,237
No, I imagine he suffocated
sometime after I buried him.

486
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:52,177
Whoa, shit!

487
00:45:52,178 --> 00:45:53,769
I didn't mean to scare you!

488
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:54,603
Who are you?

489
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:55,979
My name's Tony, I was just on the trail,

490
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:58,409
and I heard this explosion, and I fell.

491
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,859
I'm sorry, I think I hit my head.

492
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,859
Is this private property?

493
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,178
Sort of.

494
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:04,319
I don't think he's one of them.

495
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,153
Why not?

496
00:46:05,154 --> 00:46:06,926
I can't imagine one of them saying shit.

497
00:46:06,927 --> 00:46:08,429
Are you kidding me?

498
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:10,059
Hey, maybe you guys can help me.

499
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:11,909
I was hiking with my
girlfriend and I lost her.

500
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:13,379
Have you seen her?

501
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,049
We haven't seen anyone today.

502
00:46:15,050 --> 00:46:15,908
Did you call the police?

503
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:17,072
No, not yet.

504
00:46:17,073 --> 00:46:18,939
I just lost her a few hours ago.

505
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:19,933
I'll just go back to the trail, I'm sorry,

506
00:46:19,934 --> 00:46:21,863
I didn't mean to trespass.

507
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,689
You're not, but you're not gonna be able

508
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:25,940
to get back to the trail.

509
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,981
How far does this thing go?

510
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:55,815
It's a giant circle.

511
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,599
- What?
- It's a cage.

512
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,500
We're stuck here.

513
00:46:58,501 --> 00:47:00,053
What are you talking about?

514
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,573
How do we get out of here?

515
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,980
We're working on it.

516
00:47:29,857 --> 00:47:31,835
What is that?

517
00:47:31,836 --> 00:47:33,086
I don't know.

518
00:47:40,135 --> 00:47:42,135
What the hell is that?

519
00:47:49,615 --> 00:47:53,409
It looks like it's being
offered as a sacrifice.

520
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:54,939
Or food.

521
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,929
You think the lures are feeding them?

522
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,713
Maybe that's why they don't kill us.

523
00:48:33,956 --> 00:48:35,706
Haley?
Are you okay?

524
00:48:36,972 --> 00:48:39,972
Haley, Haley, are you okay?

525
00:48:40,870 --> 00:48:42,233
Haley, can you hear me?

526
00:48:43,090 --> 00:48:44,090
Yeah.

527
00:48:46,183 --> 00:48:47,681
Just hold on,
Haley, just hold on, okay?

528
00:48:47,682 --> 00:48:50,975
We're coming after you,
all right, don't move!

529
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:02,506
Alex!

530
00:49:05,123 --> 00:49:06,790
Can you climb out?

531
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:09,817
No, Alex, my leg!

532
00:49:20,915 --> 00:49:22,356
What was that?

533
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:23,357
Haley!

534
00:49:24,557 --> 00:49:25,809
Hold on, I'm coming down!

535
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:27,259
- No!
- What do you mean, no?

536
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:28,489
She needs our help!

537
00:49:28,490 --> 00:49:32,057
God damn it, get back, those
things will get both of you!

538
00:49:32,058 --> 00:49:33,058
Alex!

539
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:35,770
Alex!

540
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,770
Haley, I need you to
stand where I can see you!

541
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:46,040
No, Alex.

542
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:47,437
Alex, wait!

543
00:49:49,117 --> 00:49:50,424
Do it!

544
00:52:02,003 --> 00:52:03,522
What the fuck, who did this to you?

545
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:04,773
Hurry, hurry!

546
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:23,525
Run, run!
What?

547
00:52:23,526 --> 00:52:25,943
Run or you'll die out here!

548
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:55,669
Alex, you're okay.

549
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:56,670
Where's Tony?

550
00:52:57,430 --> 00:52:59,369
Let's go inside.

551
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:00,586
Don't you think we
should go look for him?

552
00:53:00,587 --> 00:53:02,139
No, it's too late.

553
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,449
Come on, we have to try.

554
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:04,899
There isn't enough time.

555
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:06,499
Alex, we can't just leave him out there.

556
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:07,759
No.

557
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:09,493
We have to get inside.

558
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:15,241
I'll start the generator.

559
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:04,589
Alex, Tony, wait, I...

560
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,270
Where is she?

561
00:54:06,271 --> 00:54:07,730
The generator.

562
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,173
The candles, hurry.

563
00:54:59,185 --> 00:55:00,852
What's down there?

564
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:12,717
What the hell is that?

565
00:55:13,865 --> 00:55:15,615
That's a generator.

566
00:55:32,393 --> 00:55:33,476
Is it gone?

567
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:36,620
For now.

568
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:38,523
Could one of you please explain to me

569
00:55:38,524 --> 00:55:39,973
what the hell's going on?

570
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,789
- Shot me.
- She saved you.

571
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:49,999
She saved us both.

572
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,369
This is fucking nuts!

573
00:55:51,370 --> 00:55:53,009
Feel free to walk out there and test it,

574
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:53,860
everyone else does.

575
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:55,373
No, no, I'm good, thanks.

576
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:58,609
So what, we have to activate
one more of those machines,

577
00:55:58,610 --> 00:56:00,153
and then we're out of here, huh?

578
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,000
That's the theory.

579
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,529
I don't get it, why don't
we just light a signal fire

580
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,509
or something, get some
reinforcements in here, huh?

581
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:09,343
I tried it.

582
00:56:09,344 --> 00:56:11,309
The wood just finds its
way back to the trees,

583
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:13,199
just like everything else living here.

584
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,200
Besides, we're in the middle of nowhere.

585
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:20,139
All right, okay, so we'll just,

586
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:21,709
we'll get out of here
sometime tomorrow, then,

587
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,640
which is fine, right?

588
00:56:22,641 --> 00:56:23,699
We'll make it out of here all right?

589
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,009
And I'll find Sandy,

590
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,719
and I'll just never go
to the mountains again.

591
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:29,379
Tony, just calm down.

592
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,069
I'm calm, okay, I'm fine, all right?

593
00:56:31,070 --> 00:56:33,363
You're freaking out, okay, just relax.

594
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,143
Yeah, all right, I'm sorry, okay?

595
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,519
Just gonna get some rest.

596
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:42,380
Is it okay if I sleep on this couch here?

597
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:47,933
All right, thanks.

598
00:57:01,310 --> 00:57:03,553
How long do you
think these candles will last?

599
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:08,013
Tonight, maybe a little longer.

600
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,360
We have to tell him.

601
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:18,679
But he's freaked out enough right now.

602
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:19,699
Besides, we can't do anything

603
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:22,909
until we turn on that third
platform device tomorrow.

604
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:23,910
Yeah.

605
00:57:25,105 --> 00:57:27,239
Did you figure out how
to reverse that thing?

606
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:28,423
No, I was kinda busy.

607
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,869
I have some ideas, though, okay?

608
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:32,819
Why don't you get some sleep?

609
00:57:32,820 --> 00:57:36,339
I'll stay up and work on it,
and keep an eye on things.

610
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:37,290
Don't you ever sleep?

611
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:39,069
Are you kidding?

612
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:41,753
Should see me during finals week.

613
00:57:41,754 --> 00:57:42,754
Okay.

614
00:57:43,604 --> 00:57:46,187
Just wake me up if you need me.

615
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,400
Subatomic dark matter particles

616
00:57:57,470 --> 00:58:01,663
provided program of valid density set.

617
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:08,233
Done an analysis of dark
matter density in a solar.

618
00:58:11,249 --> 00:58:14,082
Forehead, no, there was something.

619
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:25,996
Receptors on nerve endings.

620
00:58:27,060 --> 00:58:28,307
Attached to ending.

621
00:58:30,366 --> 00:58:31,366
Okay.

622
00:58:32,740 --> 00:58:35,919
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

623
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,920
Damn it.

624
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,053
My hands clean.

625
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:44,969
Encoded into these receptors
is density waveform,

626
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,038
like a set of coordinates.

627
00:58:47,039 --> 00:58:48,206
Coordinates.

628
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:52,340
Adjusting
the balance in the core

629
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,883
allows you to translocate.

630
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,300
Gotcha.

631
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,413
Coordinates
are set by F times Z,

632
00:59:01,887 --> 00:59:04,887
divided by the essential coefficient.

633
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:12,864
Tony.

634
00:59:15,513 --> 00:59:16,513
Tony.

635
00:59:18,651 --> 00:59:19,651
Sandy?

636
00:59:37,651 --> 00:59:39,832
Sandy, how did you get here?

637
00:59:39,833 --> 00:59:42,166
Come with me, Tony.

638
00:59:51,435 --> 00:59:52,435
Sandy?

639
00:59:53,326 --> 00:59:54,159
Sandy.

640
00:59:54,159 --> 00:59:55,159
It wasn't her.

641
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:06,700
How did it get in here?

642
01:00:06,701 --> 01:00:08,023
I don't know.

643
01:00:09,031 --> 01:00:14,031
Haley!

644
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:15,474
Alex, Alex!

645
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:31,733
It's okay, Haley,
you're gonna be all right.

646
01:00:53,557 --> 01:00:56,557
Where the hell are they coming from?

647
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:07,740
Ah, there's a pipe or
chimney or something back here.

648
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:11,660
The old chimney.

649
01:01:13,330 --> 01:01:14,575
Yeah, I think it leads to the ba...

650
01:01:14,576 --> 01:01:17,493
Jesus!

651
01:01:32,171 --> 01:01:33,271
Alex.

652
01:01:33,272 --> 01:01:34,456
It's gonna be okay, Haley.

653
01:01:34,457 --> 01:01:35,993
- It hurts.
- I know.

654
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:39,313
Oh god, Alex.

655
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:42,099
It's okay, all right?

656
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:45,339
Just hang in there.
It hurts.

657
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:46,270
I know.

658
01:01:46,271 --> 01:01:47,379
What the hell happened?

659
01:01:47,380 --> 01:01:48,939
Sorry, all right?

660
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,399
It's my fault, I thought it was her.

661
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,500
What, thought it was who?

662
01:01:51,501 --> 01:01:53,039
I thought it
was Sandy, I'm sorry.

663
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,519
Who the hell is Sandy?

664
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,360
My girlfriend, I
should've just woken you up.

665
01:01:57,363 --> 01:01:58,270
It's okay.

666
01:01:58,271 --> 01:02:00,019
It hurts so bad.

667
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,620
I know.

668
01:02:01,621 --> 01:02:03,209
You just have to hang on, Haley.

669
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,929
Okay, just until morning.

670
01:02:04,930 --> 01:02:06,793
Just until it's light out, okay?

671
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:10,939
I know.

672
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,449
We'll just talk, okay?

673
01:02:12,450 --> 01:02:16,139
We'll just talk, and you
can just forget, okay?

674
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,629
Okay.

675
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:20,022
Tony, why don't you tell us about Sandy?

676
01:02:20,023 --> 01:02:20,856
What?

677
01:02:20,857 --> 01:02:22,137
Just tell us about her.

678
01:02:25,783 --> 01:02:28,059
Well, she really loves
hiking in the outdoors.

679
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:30,320
Just listen to our voices, Haley.

680
01:02:30,321 --> 01:02:31,320
Yeah.

681
01:02:31,321 --> 01:02:32,666
I thought I loved the outdoors,

682
01:02:32,667 --> 01:02:34,553
but I've got nothing on this girl.

683
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,133
She goes out hiking alone a lot.

684
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,959
I keep trying to make
her to go with friends,

685
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,269
'cause I'm afraid something
will happen to her,

686
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:44,489
but she just goes out anyway.

687
01:02:44,490 --> 01:02:46,340
She says it freshens her mind, right?

688
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:49,909
Well this morning she was going out,

689
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:51,710
and for once she let me go with her.

690
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,309
I had to stop and tie
my boots along the way,

691
01:02:54,310 --> 01:02:56,709
and the next thing I knew, she
went ahead, and she was gone.

692
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,896
- Tony.
- Damn it, I should've stopped

693
01:02:57,897 --> 01:02:59,219
and I should've let her go ahead.

694
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:00,620
What else about her, Tony?

695
01:03:01,470 --> 01:03:02,470
How did you meet?

696
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,142
We met in class like
a year ago, you know?

697
01:03:07,143 --> 01:03:09,729
She was the kind of
girl that would disagree

698
01:03:09,730 --> 01:03:11,349
with everything I said.

699
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,759
What class was it?

700
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,502
Women's Studies.

701
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,200
Well I need it to graduate.

702
01:03:22,560 --> 01:03:23,560
What else, Tony?

703
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:26,952
What was your first date?

704
01:03:28,830 --> 01:03:30,419
Was she here?

705
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:31,569
Those things know what she looks like,

706
01:03:31,570 --> 01:03:33,469
so she must have been here.

707
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,270
They could be keeping her somewhere!

708
01:03:36,752 --> 01:03:39,189
Tony, she was outside
when the sun went down.

709
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,170
She's not coming back,

710
01:03:40,171 --> 01:03:41,419
I'm sorry.
How can you be sure, huh?

711
01:03:41,420 --> 01:03:43,220
They might be keeping her somewhere.

712
01:03:50,872 --> 01:03:52,792
We're not making it out
of here tomorrow, are we?

713
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:56,390
You guys are real uppers.

714
01:04:01,950 --> 01:04:03,613
Seriously, just shoot me now.

715
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,463
I'm sorry, I lost the gun.

716
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:15,112
Haley, just hang on.

717
01:04:15,113 --> 01:04:16,343
Just hang on.

718
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:21,850
Haley, I'm not gonna lose you, too.

719
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:07,570
Alex.

720
01:06:09,490 --> 01:06:11,379
No, no, Alex, it's me, I swear.

721
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:13,409
I woke up outside after the sun came up.

722
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,410
It's me.

723
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:17,729
Jesus, Alex, do I have to tell you

724
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:19,739
how I lost my virginity now?

725
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:20,993
It's me, I swear.

726
01:06:23,330 --> 01:06:24,580
You're right.

727
01:06:36,650 --> 01:06:39,165
We're gonna get
out of here today, okay?

728
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,166
I hope so.

729
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:44,180
Well, I started reprogramming
the machine last night, so

730
01:06:46,566 --> 01:06:48,490
I think we have to tell him.

731
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:50,330
Tell me what?

732
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:02,689
So one of us has to plug
into it as a power source.

733
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,849
What are you talking about?

734
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,899
Well, it uses life energy.

735
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:07,989
It kills you.

736
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,119
You're fucking kidding me.

737
01:07:09,120 --> 01:07:10,616
It might not kill you,
okay, we don't know that.

738
01:07:10,617 --> 01:07:12,817
And just who's gonna
volunteer to do this?

739
01:07:14,140 --> 01:07:15,529
Me.

740
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:17,499
You thought I was gonna volunteer?

741
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,859
You guys weren't even
gonna tell me, were you?

742
01:07:18,860 --> 01:07:20,049
We're telling you right now.

743
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:20,980
We were gonna ask you.

744
01:07:20,981 --> 01:07:22,659
Well my answer is fuck no.

745
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:24,139
Jeez, this place is a fucking nightmare.

746
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:26,099
Yeah, it is, okay, so why
don't you just shut the fuck up

747
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:26,933
and deal with it?

748
01:07:26,934 --> 01:07:28,069
Stop it, all right?

749
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:30,739
We'll draw straws, it's the only fair way.

750
01:07:30,740 --> 01:07:32,619
We'll go out and activate
the third machine,

751
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:33,453
and when we come back, then we'll...

752
01:07:33,454 --> 01:07:34,719
What if I refuse, huh?

753
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:36,309
Odds are you're not
gonna have to be a hero,

754
01:07:36,310 --> 01:07:38,533
so don't worry about it too much.

755
01:07:49,350 --> 01:07:50,350
Alex.

756
01:07:58,080 --> 01:07:59,330
They're over here, too.

757
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:04,285
Shit, they're surrounding us.

758
01:08:05,390 --> 01:08:07,973
Okay, there's none over here.

759
01:10:18,991 --> 01:10:20,269
It's stuck.

760
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:21,270
What?

761
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,620
I don't know, I can't get it.

762
01:11:00,730 --> 01:11:01,730
All right.

763
01:11:03,022 --> 01:11:04,563
Which one of you's gonna volunteer?

764
01:11:05,660 --> 01:11:07,499
Tony, no.

765
01:11:07,500 --> 01:11:08,969
Okay, we're gonna take
a walk back, and we're...

766
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,799
Damn it, Tony, we had a plan.

767
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:12,809
No, I'm making the plans now!

768
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:13,657
You're gonna start that thing up,

769
01:11:13,658 --> 01:11:15,569
and I don't care which one of you does it!

770
01:11:15,570 --> 01:11:17,220
I'm getting out of here, so move!

771
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:20,770
Come on!

772
01:11:48,210 --> 01:11:50,253
Tony, we have to work together on this.

773
01:11:50,254 --> 01:11:51,334
You're gonna get us all killed.

774
01:11:51,335 --> 01:11:52,839
No, you weren't even
gonna tell me 'till I asked.

775
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:53,969
You were trying to trick me into it.

776
01:11:53,970 --> 01:11:55,210
No we weren't.

777
01:12:00,340 --> 01:12:02,283
Tony, we don't even know if it'll kill.

778
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:03,323
Yeah, but you're
willing to take that risk

779
01:12:03,324 --> 01:12:04,324
on me, weren't you?

780
01:13:17,253 --> 01:13:18,253
Oh no.

781
01:13:20,464 --> 01:13:22,012
What are we gonna do now?

782
01:13:22,013 --> 01:13:23,531
Don't know.

783
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:24,962
Alex, what are we gonna do now?

784
01:13:24,963 --> 01:13:26,213
I don't know!

785
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:40,100
Alex, hold on a second.

786
01:13:40,100 --> 01:13:40,933
What?

787
01:13:40,934 --> 01:13:42,289
- Your grandfather.
- What about him?

788
01:13:42,290 --> 01:13:43,349
Look, you said that he probably...

789
01:13:43,350 --> 01:13:45,543
We don't have time to
just stand around, Justine!

790
01:13:51,180 --> 01:13:52,629
Haley, I mean.

791
01:13:52,630 --> 01:13:55,319
Look, we're running out of...
Would you just listen to me?

792
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:57,009
You said that he probably suffocated

793
01:13:57,010 --> 01:13:58,529
sometime after you buried him, right?

794
01:13:58,530 --> 01:13:59,363
So what?

795
01:13:59,364 --> 01:14:00,837
After you buried him.

796
01:15:20,559 --> 01:15:22,559
Haley, candles, hurry.

797
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:45,540
Alex.

798
01:15:46,869 --> 01:15:49,702
Why aren't the lures attacking us?

799
01:17:46,249 --> 01:17:47,249
Alex!

800
01:18:12,863 --> 01:18:14,863
You ruined everything!

801
01:18:26,791 --> 01:18:28,655
No!

802
01:18:39,773 --> 01:18:41,041
What did you do?

803
01:18:41,042 --> 01:18:42,459
I'm sorry, I...

804
01:19:36,455 --> 01:19:37,402
Goodbye, Haley.

805
01:19:37,403 --> 01:19:42,402
Alex!

806
01:20:04,142 --> 01:20:05,342
No!

807
01:20:05,343 --> 01:20:07,570
Justine!

808
01:23:58,077 --> 01:23:59,506
Alex?

809
01:23:59,507 --> 01:24:00,507
Alex.

810
01:24:01,518 --> 01:24:02,518
Alex.

811
01:24:03,688 --> 01:24:05,105
Oh no, Alex.

812
01:24:06,087 --> 01:24:07,087
Alex!

813
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:12,147
Alex.

814
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,880
Where am I?

815
01:26:07,592 --> 01:26:10,759
Haley.

816
01:30:50,901 --> 01:30:52,984
Mommy.
