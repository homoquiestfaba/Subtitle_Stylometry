I'm just so tired.

537
00:30:43,618 --> 00:30:44,352
Hmm.

538
00:30:49,152 --> 00:30:52,252

[Hardin] <i>[voice-over]</i>
<i>You're enjoying yourself.</i>

542
00:31:02,452 --> 00:31:05,585
One little slip
and it could all be over.

543
00:31:07,552 --> 00:31:09,219
Are you still talking
about my shave?

544
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:15,119
I meant the shave,

545
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,219
but if you wanted to
talk about last night.

546
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:21,052
I'm sorry, Tess.

547
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:23,119
I didn't mean to
get that trashed.

548
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:24,519
[Tessa] <i>[voice-over]</i>
It's just with your dad...

549
00:31:24,552 --> 00:31:25,819
[Hardin] <i>[voice-over]</i>
<i>I'm not my dad. I'm not him.</i>

550
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,119
Tess, if you don't like it,
tell me.

551
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:31,119
- I don't like it.
- Then I'll stop.

552
00:31:32,252 --> 00:31:33,419
I won't drink another drop.

553
00:31:33,552 --> 00:31:34,819
Really?

554
00:31:37,419 --> 00:31:40,319

[smacks lips]

556
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:52,619
What... what are you.?

557
00:31:52,686 --> 00:31:54,119

[indistinct conversation]

563
00:32:22,085 --> 00:32:23,552
[Carol] She doesn't want you
here.

564
00:32:23,653 --> 00:32:24,519
[Hardin] I didn't fly

565
00:32:24,619 --> 00:32:26,085
5,000 fucking miles
to argue with you.

566
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:27,419
[Landon] I don't know if she's
awake.

567
00:32:27,486 --> 00:32:28,786
Let me just at least see
if she's... Hardin!

568
00:32:28,886 --> 00:32:29,920
Tess.

569
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,020
Hey.
- [Tessa] No. No, no.

570
00:32:31,119 --> 00:32:31,920
No, no, no.
- [Hardin] Hey, hey, hey.

571
00:32:32,052 --> 00:32:33,286
Do you want him here, Tess?

572
00:32:33,386 --> 00:32:34,819
You're fucked if you think
I'm going anywhere.

573
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,619
Tess.
- No, get off me!

574
00:32:35,686 --> 00:32:36,986
Hey, it's okay.

575
00:32:37,085 --> 00:32:38,052
You gotta leave.

576
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:39,419
You gotta leave
or I'm calling the cops?

577
00:32:39,452 --> 00:32:40,686
Call the fucking cops.
Call 'em.

578
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,286
I'm not going anywhere!
- [Landon] That's not funny!

579
00:32:42,352 --> 00:32:44,085
- I'm not laughing!
- She doesn't want you here!

580
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:45,920
You have no fucking idea
what she wants!

581
00:32:46,052 --> 00:32:47,119
You weren't here
when she needed you!

582
00:32:47,252 --> 00:32:49,185
Now, you're make...
You're making it worse.

583
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:51,986
[in unison] Tess?

584
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:54,252
Ugh, she's trying to avoid you.

585
00:32:54,352 --> 00:32:55,252
You're the reason she took...
- [door slams]

586
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:01,619
I'll check the front door.

587

00:33:27,786 --> 00:33:29,219
[Hardin] Hey, hey, Tess.

591
00:33:30,719 --> 00:33:33,319
It's not about you.

592
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:34,653
I know.
I... I just want to...

593
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:35,719
[Tessa] I need <i>quiet </i>.

594
00:33:37,286 --> 00:33:38,219
Please.

595
00:33:39,786 --> 00:33:42,686

[melancholic music continues]

598
00:34:08,886 --> 00:34:11,185
[footsteps approaching]

599
00:34:20,553 --> 00:34:22,786
I haven't always
treated you fairly.

600
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,819
You hate me, Carol.

601
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,886
You've always hated me.

602
00:34:25,953 --> 00:34:27,319
And it's fine. I don't care.

603
00:34:27,452 --> 00:34:29,953
But you should know your opinion
means fuck all to me.

604
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:31,920
And I mean that
in the nicest way.

605
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:33,319
You're exactly like him.

606
00:34:33,453 --> 00:34:35,419
That's exactly how Richard
used to talk to my parents.

607
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:36,719
I am not him.

608
00:34:36,786 --> 00:34:38,219
All right. Well.

609
00:34:38,286 --> 00:34:40,319
I only care
about what's best for Tessa.

610
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,686
So do I.

611
00:34:41,786 --> 00:34:44,853
The one thing that
I thought that I taught her,

612
00:34:44,986 --> 00:34:47,386
and you may not believe me,

613
00:34:47,487 --> 00:34:51,686
was to not have to depend on
a man the way that I did.

614
00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:54,052
And now, look at her.

615
00:34:54,185 --> 00:34:57,185
She's... she's reduced to nothing
every time you leave.

616
00:34:57,252 --> 00:34:59,819
- Listen, I'm not...
- No, no. Let me finish.

617
00:34:59,886 --> 00:35:02,185
Yeah, you always come back

618
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:05,586
the way that Richard
never did for us.

619
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,219
But you never stay.

620
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,653
I don't know
what you want from me, Carol.

621
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:16,953
I love her.

622
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,487
I'm never letting her go.

623
00:35:18,586 --> 00:35:20,953
If you really love her, then
you'll do what's best for her.

624
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,520
And that is up to you now.

625
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:25,453
Because you are the only person
that she'll listen to.

626
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,219
That girl loves you way too much
for her own good.

627
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:32,052
But Hardin, you and I both know

628
00:35:32,185 --> 00:35:34,387
that you can't give her
what she needs.

629
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:38,586
And that is stopping her
from finding someone who will.

630
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,387
[sentimental music]

631
00:35:57,786 --> 00:36:00,119
I can only imagine
how you're feeling right now.

632
00:36:03,753 --> 00:36:07,152
I keep thinking about
the last time I saw him.

633
00:36:07,252 --> 00:36:09,085
He was eating
half my damn pizza.

634
00:36:09,152 --> 00:36:12,453
He was happy.

635
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,686
Just happy
he had a place to stay.

636
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,686
I am so sorry
for what happened in London.

637
00:36:33,052 --> 00:36:34,686
I really am.

638
00:36:34,753 --> 00:36:38,920
I thought we had a love
that was out of a novel.

639
00:36:38,986 --> 00:36:41,387
And no matter how hard
or fast or tough it was,

640
00:36:41,453 --> 00:36:43,619
we'd survive to tell the story.

641
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,453
[Hardin] Hey.

642
00:36:47,586 --> 00:36:51,686
We do. And we can.
We can survive it.

643
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:57,819
I don't wanna survive.
I want to live.

644
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,819
[sighs]

645
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,920
I can't keep doing this.

646
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,453
Tess.

647
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:21,119
You don't love me enough
to fight for me.

648
00:37:21,252 --> 00:37:23,586
You gave up every time.

649
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,653
I tried.

650
00:37:33,753 --> 00:37:35,686
I really fucking tried.

651
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,586
[sniffles]

652
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,686
I'm sorry I couldn't fix you.

653
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,686
Me, too.

654
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,052
Me, too.

655
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:21,185
[car doors close]

656
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,520
Who's paying for all this?

657
00:38:27,586 --> 00:38:29,686
You don't have to worry about
money right now, honey.

658
00:38:32,953 --> 00:38:34,185
Hey.

659
00:38:35,553 --> 00:38:38,220
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay.

660
00:38:39,553 --> 00:38:41,253
[sniffles]

661
00:38:41,387 --> 00:38:45,953
Ugh. Hey, I got make up on...
- Oh. And.

662
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:46,886
And a little bit of snot.

663
00:38:47,052 --> 00:38:48,152
- [chuckles]
- Just a little bit.

664
00:38:48,287 --> 00:38:50,253
[Tessa's teary chuckle]

665
00:38:50,387 --> 00:38:52,686
- You ready?
- [Tessa] Yeah.

666
00:39:03,186 --> 00:39:06,520
[song playing]

667
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:38,586
I hadn't seen my father
for nine years.

668
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:43,686
But reconnecting with him
was one of the greatest gifts.

669
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:46,819
Even if it was only briefly.

670
00:39:50,686 --> 00:39:53,220
He had so many demons, but.

671
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,686
He was also so kind.

672
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:02,753
And he was trying
to be better for me.

673
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:07,085
I know that.

674
00:40:09,052 --> 00:40:10,553

You need a ride? Hardin?

677
00:40:29,353 --> 00:40:30,353
I don't think I should go.

678
00:40:30,487 --> 00:40:32,886
Why? You were his friend,
kind of.

679
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,586
And you paid for it, so.

680
00:40:34,719 --> 00:40:37,487
Landon, do me a favor
and keep that between us.

681
00:40:37,553 --> 00:40:39,287
Sure. Doesn't mean
you shouldn't come.

682
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,886
So, come.

683
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:43,719

00:41:14,553 --> 00:41:16,420
Sorry,
I didn't know that you were.

689
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:25,719
I don't know half these people.

690
00:41:25,786 --> 00:41:27,253
[Hardin] It's kind of weird.

691
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,920
When people go to funerals of
someone they don't even know.

692
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,786
It's just especially him.

693
00:41:32,853 --> 00:41:35,353
I mean,
they're total hypocrites.

694
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,020
No one here even liked him.

695
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,153
You did.

696
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:42,686
And even I did.

697
00:41:45,153 --> 00:41:47,053
I'm really mad at him.

698
00:41:47,153 --> 00:41:50,619
I'm like. I'm like pissed off.

699
00:41:50,686 --> 00:41:53,287
Hey, you have every right
to be mad at him.

700
00:41:53,353 --> 00:41:55,953
Whether he's dead or not.

701
00:41:56,021 --> 00:42:00,553
I saw how much it meant to you
to have him back in your life.

702
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,920
And I think he is an idiot

703
00:42:03,086 --> 00:42:05,420
for throwing that all the way
just to get high.

704
00:42:09,586 --> 00:42:11,453
But I mean, I'm one to talk,
aren't I?

705
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:15,553
I'm so sorry
it took something like this

706
00:42:15,619 --> 00:42:18,287
for me to realize
how much you mean to me.

707
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:22,520
And how much.
I want to be there for you.

708
00:42:22,653 --> 00:42:25,686
[sentimental music]

709
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,619
I need to go back inside.

710
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,686
Okay.

having kids with you.

888
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:12,921
Or, obviously, if you're...
If you're not pregnant,

889
00:52:13,021 --> 00:52:15,687
I guess maybe
after you finish college,

890
00:52:15,754 --> 00:52:18,021
or I don't know, either way.

891
00:52:18,086 --> 00:52:19,454
[cutlery clattering]

892
00:52:22,253 --> 00:52:23,687
I can't get pregnant.

893
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,987
The. the doctor said
that it'll...

894
00:52:29,086 --> 00:52:32,488
It'd be almost impossible
for me to conceive.

895
00:52:32,620 --> 00:52:35,320
And even if I did, there'd be
a high risk of miscarriage

896
00:52:35,388 --> 00:52:36,687
so I can't.

897
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,120
[dishes clanking]

898
00:52:45,021 --> 00:52:46,186
Agh!

899
00:52:47,654 --> 00:52:49,454
Uh, can you say somethin'?

900
00:52:50,354 --> 00:52:51,554
[exhaling]

901
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:54,554
I don't know what to say.

902
00:52:54,654 --> 00:52:56,086
What do you... what do you mean,
you don't know what...

903
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,153
You don't want kids anyway.

904
00:52:57,220 --> 00:53:00,186
No, I-I-I didn't.

905
00:53:01,587 --> 00:53:04,120
Now, it just feels like
it's been taken away from us.

906
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,720
Uh, no, not from you.
From me.

907
00:53:10,354 --> 00:53:11,620
Wait.

908
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,120
That was the wrong thing to say.
You know I didn't mean it.

909
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:14,720
Tess, wait. Please wait.

910
00:53:15,754 --> 00:53:17,320
Tessa.
- [breathing deeply]

911
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:19,521
Please just don't
shut down on me again.

912
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:23,654
I don't give a fuck if we can
have kids or not, honestly.

913
00:53:23,754 --> 00:53:25,687
I'm sorry that you feel like
I took something from you.

914
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,053
- I don't.
- But you're not the one

915
00:53:27,153 --> 00:53:29,388
who's just had their dreams
crushed here, you know?

916
00:53:31,053 --> 00:53:32,687
Like you didn't want kids
until two seconds ago

917
00:53:32,787 --> 00:53:34,720
which just came out of nowhere.

918
00:53:38,421 --> 00:53:39,720
I just want to be with you.

919
00:53:41,153 --> 00:53:43,587
Kids, no kids. [scoffs]

920
00:53:43,687 --> 00:53:44,820
When I was in London,

921
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:46,687
I could not stop
thinking about you.

922
00:53:48,454 --> 00:53:51,654
Right. Yeah, I'm sure...
I'm sure you saw my face

923
00:53:51,787 --> 00:53:53,987
when you were sleeping
with that girl at the party.

924
00:53:54,086 --> 00:53:55,488
Who are you.? What?

925
00:53:55,587 --> 00:53:59,288
Te... nothing
of the sort happened.

926
00:53:59,354 --> 00:54:00,620
And I won't lie to you.
- Shut up. You did.

927
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,021
She did... she did try
to kiss me and when she did,

928
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:05,820
I literally threw up, so.

929
00:54:05,921 --> 00:54:08,354
You literally threw up.

930
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:09,554
I did.

931
00:54:09,654 --> 00:54:11,720
- Threw up. [chuckles]
- I threw up. [chuckles]

932
00:54:11,854 --> 00:54:15,720
Instant noodles, and it went
on her head. [chuckles]

933
00:54:17,086 --> 00:54:18,854
[romantic music playing]

934
00:54:18,921 --> 00:54:20,053
Good.

935
00:54:20,186 --> 00:54:21,587
[laughs] Good?

936
00:54:22,954 --> 00:54:24,288
- Yeah, good. [laughs]
- Good.

937
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:28,186
[phone vibrating]

938
00:54:37,421 --> 00:54:39,987
[Landon] And that is why
Hardin is afraid of gerbils.

939
00:54:40,086 --> 00:54:42,454
[laughter]

940
00:54:42,587 --> 00:54:44,021
If you don't stop
makin' up stories,

941
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:45,921
I'll tell Nora about that time
you wet yourself.

942
00:54:45,954 --> 00:54:47,321
[laughter]

943
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:48,388
Touché.

944
00:54:48,488 --> 00:54:49,421
All right, then.

945
00:54:49,488 --> 00:54:52,021
This is so good.
The sauce is amazing.

946
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,954
It's all of Landon's favorites
before he leaves us.

947
00:54:54,053 --> 00:54:57,153
This food
almost makes me sad to go.

948
00:54:57,254 --> 00:55:01,021
So Nora, what part of New York
are you in?

949
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,454
Um, East 14th and First Ave.

950
00:55:03,521 --> 00:55:06,554
What she actually meant was
how far is it from Landon.

951
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:08,354
[Nora] Oh. Um.

952
00:55:08,454 --> 00:55:10,720
- Like.
- Like 50 minutes by train.

953
00:55:10,820 --> 00:55:12,221
Fifty minutes.

954
00:55:12,321 --> 00:55:13,488
I'm sorry. It's just
practically long distance.

955
00:55:13,554 --> 00:55:14,754
I don't know how
you're gonna make that work.

956
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,521
I mean,
I have to go through there

957
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,987
to get to class every day.

958
00:55:18,086 --> 00:55:19,288
I mean, not... not that we'd be

959
00:55:19,421 --> 00:55:21,654
seeing each other every day.
But I mean, we could

960
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:23,954
if you wanted too.

961
00:55:24,086 --> 00:55:26,053
[laughter]

962
00:55:26,153 --> 00:55:28,120
So, Hardin,
graduation is looming.

963
00:55:28,221 --> 00:55:29,354
No, we're not doing this again.
I don't want...

964
00:55:29,454 --> 00:55:30,488
Have you given more thought
to...

965
00:55:30,587 --> 00:55:32,053
No, I haven't
'cause I'm not going to

966
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,854
walk for graduation, okay?
I don't want to walk.

967
00:55:33,987 --> 00:55:35,288
- [Tessa] Really?
- Yeah, really.

968
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:36,488
- You sure?
- [Hardin] I'm sure.

969
00:55:36,620 --> 00:55:37,787
Hm.

970
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,254
I just thought.

971
00:55:40,354 --> 00:55:42,687
I don't know. I just thought
for sure you'd reconsider.

972
00:55:43,854 --> 00:55:45,354
So you've obviously asked her

973
00:55:45,488 --> 00:55:47,654
to ask me?
- [Ken] What? What?

974
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,854
[Hardin sighs]

975
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:50,454
Fuck it, fine. I'll walk
for graduation then.

976
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:52,053
[laughter]

977
00:55:52,153 --> 00:55:53,554
- [Ken] Yes!
- Don't make me change my mind.

978
00:55:53,654 --> 00:55:54,687
[laughter]

979
00:55:54,754 --> 00:55:56,521
To walking.

980
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,521
[Karen] Cheers to that.

981
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,787
- To walking.
- [Hardin] Cheers to that.

982
00:55:59,921 --> 00:56:00,554
- [Ken] To walking.
- Here we go again.

983
00:56:00,587 --> 00:56:04,654
[laughter]

984
00:56:04,787 --> 00:56:07,521
[muted chatter and laughter]

985
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,754
[Ken] Come on.

986
00:56:14,654 --> 00:56:17,321
[tap running]

987
00:56:20,154 --> 00:56:23,954
Hey, I need to talk to you
about something.

988
00:56:24,021 --> 00:56:25,154
Okay.

989
00:56:26,021 --> 00:56:27,187
[door closes]

990
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:43,687
I made a decision
about something, and I didn't.

991
00:56:46,121 --> 00:56:48,921
With everything
that's been going on

992
00:56:49,021 --> 00:56:51,187
because of a lot of things, but.

993
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,254
We need time apart.

994
00:56:55,321 --> 00:57:01,521
Like. like really apart.

995
00:57:01,620 --> 00:57:02,521
And...

996
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:03,488
[scoffs]

997
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,921
This seems like
the only way to make sure

998
00:57:05,987 --> 00:57:08,554
that that actually happen.

999
00:57:08,687 --> 00:57:10,053
Okay, why?

1000
00:57:10,187 --> 00:57:13,053
Because we fight
more than we get along.

1001
00:57:13,154 --> 00:57:17,087
And when we make up,
it's over sex.

1002
00:57:19,221 --> 00:57:21,321
That's not...
That's not really true.

1003
00:57:21,421 --> 00:57:23,154
It is, and it's not healthy.

1004
00:57:23,254 --> 00:57:26,121
[exhaling deeply]
How is sex not healthy?

1005
00:57:26,221 --> 00:57:30,154
We've been having lots of fun,
happy, consensual sex.

1006
00:57:30,254 --> 00:57:33,221
And it's been full of fucking
love and fucking trust.

1007
00:57:33,288 --> 00:57:36,187
I can't keep going around
in circles like this.

1008
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:42,321
Okay, okay.
I understand.

1009
00:57:42,454 --> 00:57:44,787
And I do have a lot to work on.

1010
00:57:44,887 --> 00:57:46,021
But we have so much time.

1011
00:57:46,121 --> 00:57:47,820
We have all the time
in the world,

1012
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:48,820
and I will work on them.

1013
00:57:48,921 --> 00:57:49,921
And I can come live with you

1014
00:57:50,021 --> 00:57:52,388
in Seattle.
- Okay. Okay.

1015
00:57:52,521 --> 00:57:54,854
I'm moving.

1016
00:57:54,954 --> 00:57:56,754
Okay.

1017
00:57:56,854 --> 00:57:58,654
I'm moving to New York.

1018
00:57:58,754 --> 00:58:00,221
I'm gonna live with Landon.

1019
00:58:00,321 --> 00:58:01,620
Landon?

1020
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:02,620
What? This was his idea?

1021
00:58:02,754 --> 00:58:04,720
No, no, no.
This was my idea.

1022
00:58:04,787 --> 00:58:05,921
This wasn't. don't...

1023
00:58:06,021 --> 00:58:07,087
He's supposed to be
my fucking brother.

1024
00:58:07,221 --> 00:58:09,720
It's not like that.
It's... no! Hey!

1025
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:11,687
- [Landon] No, no.
- [Nora] I'm just gonna...

1026
00:58:11,754 --> 00:58:12,921
[Hardin] New York!

1027
00:58:12,987 --> 00:58:13,954
New York!
You didn't fucking tell me!

1028
00:58:14,054 --> 00:58:15,154
[Landon] Well, it wasn't
my call.

1029
00:58:15,254 --> 00:58:16,454
You'd broken up with her.
What do you...?

1030
00:58:16,521 --> 00:58:18,321
You've been pretending
to be my fucking friend!

1031
00:58:18,421 --> 00:58:20,388
I didn't pretend shit, Hardin!

1032
00:58:20,488 --> 00:58:23,187
I'm her friend too, and I'm
cleaning up your shit as usual.

1033
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:25,288
Well, go ahead.

1034
00:58:25,388 --> 00:58:26,687
Fucking hit me, you big man.

1035
00:58:26,787 --> 00:58:28,054
Big piece of shit.

1036
00:58:36,587 --> 00:58:38,687
[screaming] Fuck.

1037
00:58:38,754 --> 00:58:41,454
[approaching footsteps]

1038
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:47,121
[breathing heavily]

1039
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,187
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Tess, but.

1040
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:04,787
You know, of all people,

1041
00:59:04,854 --> 00:59:08,022
he knows
how much you mean to me.

1042
00:59:08,154 --> 00:59:09,254
That you're my

1043
00:59:09,354 --> 00:59:10,820
fucking lifeline,
and he didn't tell me,

1044
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:12,854
and that fucking hurts.

1045
00:59:12,988 --> 00:59:16,054
[exhales]
It fucking hurts, okay?

1046
00:59:20,754 --> 00:59:22,354
I'm shit without you.

1047
00:59:25,488 --> 00:59:29,620
I'm just as good at dooming
this relationship as you.

1048
00:59:29,754 --> 00:59:31,421
[Hardin] Is it doomed?

1049
00:59:31,554 --> 00:59:33,454
Is it? I feel like
we can make this work.

1050
00:59:35,187 --> 00:59:38,121
You're trying,
and I see that. But I.

1051
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:40,121
I can't keep doing this
back and forth.

1052
00:59:40,221 --> 00:59:42,955
It's... it's... it's
not just with you.

1053
00:59:43,054 --> 00:59:44,254
It's with me.

1054
00:59:44,321 --> 00:59:46,288
You can't just escape yourself

1055
00:59:46,354 --> 00:59:48,254
by moving from one place
to another, you know.

1056
00:59:50,754 --> 00:59:52,221
You know that, right?

1057
00:59:52,321 --> 00:59:57,022
I need to figure things out.
And. if you love me,

1058
00:59:57,154 --> 00:59:59,254
if you really love me...

01:28:46,088 --> 01:28:47,188
- Yeah?
- Mm.

1576
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:50,856
It's not... it's not bad.

1577
01:28:50,956 --> 01:28:51,722
But.?

1578
01:28:51,856 --> 01:28:53,055
[laughing] It's not good.

1579
01:28:53,155 --> 01:28:54,923
[Robert] Oh, come on.

1580
01:28:55,023 --> 01:28:56,789
So one of my classmates
invited us

1581
01:28:56,856 --> 01:28:58,923
to his girlfriend's
gallery opening

1582
01:28:58,989 --> 01:29:00,622
in the village tonight.
- [Tessa] Mm-hm.

1583
01:29:00,689 --> 01:29:02,856
Do you wanna go?

1584
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:07,256
Um, yeah.
I mean, I'd love to but.

1585
01:29:07,356 --> 01:29:09,223
I've actually got this thing
tonight.

1586
01:29:09,323 --> 01:29:10,622
Can we do it another time?

1587
01:29:10,722 --> 01:29:13,523
Yeah. Of course.

1588
01:29:13,589 --> 01:29:15,523
Okay.

1589
01:29:15,622 --> 01:29:19,290
[cars honking]

1590
01:29:19,423 --> 01:29:22,223
[Hardin] So after she
kicked me out,

1591
01:29:22,323 --> 01:29:23,923
I really felt
that my entire world

1592
01:29:24,023 --> 01:29:26,088
was just crumbling around me.
- [door opens]

1593
01:29:26,156 --> 01:29:27,556
[Hardin] I was afraid
I was going to spiral.

1594
01:29:29,055 --> 01:29:30,722
I really had
nothing going for me.

1595
01:29:32,789 --> 01:29:33,756
But then I got the call.

1596
01:29:35,390 --> 01:29:39,323
Dowless and Sons wanted the book
to release immediately.

1597
01:29:39,456 --> 01:29:43,023
So, I picked up the phone
and I called.

1598
01:29:43,122 --> 01:29:44,290
I called my therapist.

1599
01:29:44,356 --> 01:29:47,023
- [crowd laugh]
- [Hardin scoffs]

1600
01:29:47,122 --> 01:29:48,189
And I took a breath.

1601
01:29:50,290 --> 01:29:51,689
And I took the deal.

1602
01:29:53,423 --> 01:29:54,556
And here we are.

1603
01:30:06,656 --> 01:30:07,756
[door closes]

1604
01:30:11,956 --> 01:30:14,290
Anyway, I'll, uh,
I'll stop blithering on,

1605
01:30:14,390 --> 01:30:16,290
and I'll actually
read something.
