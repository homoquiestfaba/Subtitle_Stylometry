1
00:00:06,505 --> 00:00:09,890
The worst is yet to come.

2
00:00:13,383 --> 00:00:19,003
In 1942, an elite combat unit of the United States and Canadian forces.

3
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,362
Officially known as the Special Task Force.

4
00:00:21,595 --> 00:00:27,004
They Sherwood, hunters, those living in the margins of society.

5
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,896
They operate training on the cliffs,

6
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,474
Airborne

7
00:00:38,193 --> 00:00:43,337
And the Nazis killed.

8
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:51,618
The summer of 1943, a few days ago to set up landing in Sicily,

9
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,572
Most elite team

10
00:00:54,677 --> 00:00:56,762
Is sent to a dangerous mission.

11
00:00:59,974 --> 00:01:05,427
This is a story about their honor.

12
00:01:08,544 --> 00:01:13,428
Task Force

13
00:01:49,813 --> 00:01:53,639
Sicilian Coast

14
00:02:29,411 --> 00:02:31,322
- Antonio.

15
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,097
- Yes.

16
00:02:34,409 --> 00:02:35,907
- What is this place?

17
00:02:36,122 --> 00:02:39,145
- Yes - the island.

18
00:02:40,725 --> 00:02:42,927
- However, no ambush, Captain?

19
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,590
- Ambush.

20
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:08,434
- Ambush

21
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,369
Hey...

22
00:04:23,859 --> 00:04:25,454
- Stop shooting.

23
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:28,080
- Stop shooting.

24
00:04:56,531 --> 00:04:57,991
Damn

25
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:16,749
(Von? Claus? Reinhardt song ...)

26
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:31,152
Von Klaus? Reinhardt.

27
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:33,758
I am sorry?

28
00:05:38,698 --> 00:05:41,241
I do not want to waste time.

29
00:05:41,505 --> 00:05:44,157
What do you do in Sicily?

30
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:51,040
Is landing here do it right?

31
00:05:57,061 --> 00:06:02,327
I asked him, but nothing unusual.

32
00:06:02,765 --> 00:06:05,666
What in Sicily you doing?

33
00:06:09,451 --> 00:06:10,910
There is no game?

34
00:06:12,691 --> 00:06:13,859
- Ok.

35
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:20,860
- This is the stubborn

36
00:06:30,581 --> 00:06:37,860
(Von? Claus? Reinhardt song)

37
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:48,704
- Article

38
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,469
- turn on.

39
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:02,044
- superior.

40
00:07:09,905 --> 00:07:11,365
- Is it fun?

41
00:07:12,884 --> 00:07:14,882
I will spit out the rest

42
00:07:15,136 --> 00:07:17,711
If he can not be opened to see?

43
00:07:22,627 --> 00:07:25,544
Do not worry ... I have more experience.

44
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,678
How are you? He just from this idea.

45
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,548
Hey ... Lieutenant.

46
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:45,993
The situation here is how you do?

47
00:07:46,242 --> 00:07:47,667
Continues to be a daily time, sir.

48
00:07:47,883 --> 00:07:51,861
I think, rather than only result in only one parameter.

49
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:54,850
- Not all civilizations. - I'm sorry, sir, I drank too much.

50
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:57,824
I came here with a serious message.

51
00:08:00,173 --> 00:08:01,179
- Jesus Christ ...

52
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,499
We have a problem in the Mediterranean.

53
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:06,374
Invasion might be delayed ...

54
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:10,519
We were ambushed, we need to solve the problem.

55
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:12,539
If not as a team,

56
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,528
LT is the most elite team

57
00:08:15,793 --> 00:08:17,105
Thank you.

58
00:08:17,367 --> 00:08:19,753
I have to say ...... this is glorious.

59
00:08:19,995 --> 00:08:22,765
Lieutenant team also brimming with confidence

60
00:08:22,994 --> 00:08:25,005
Brave soldiers, therefore, what is our mission, sir?

61
00:08:25,222 --> 00:08:26,584
He landed on the island ...

62
00:08:26,863 --> 00:08:28,478
Rescue, of course ...

63
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,928
Must act quickly. - Yes, sir.

64
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:34,343
To complete the task within 16 hours. Select and killing five people

65
00:08:34,534 --> 00:08:36,904
Must be the most elite team.

66
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:39,321
- Jesus Christ ... - I think I would choose Dick Sergeant?

67
00:08:39,545 --> 00:08:42,040
- This is an important task, sir. - I think.

68
00:08:42,297 --> 00:08:45,047
- Will be able to complete this task for you?

69
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,636
- God bless us......

70
00:08:46,846 --> 00:08:50,567
- No, sir, - but God help the enemy.

71
00:08:52,851 --> 00:08:56,246
Feeling great pitcher, but I did not throw the ball very well.

72
00:08:56,544 --> 00:08:58,074
Try again thrown the ball.

73
00:08:58,324 --> 00:09:00,267
And maintain a good ball.

74
00:09:04,498 --> 00:09:05,958
- Damn.

75
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:10,302
Well......

76
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:13,197
Barnett, Reeves ...... please stay here.

77
00:09:14,703 --> 00:09:17,312
- Welcomed him ...... - Hey ......

78
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,798

00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,278
...... And you should not be playing baseball. Canadian...

81
00:09:24,572 --> 00:09:27,146
Do not play baseball.

82
00:09:27,407 --> 00:09:31,554
- You play well, not. - I still play if he throws it.

83
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,577
- Try.

84
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,053
- Half an hour, do not delay.

85
00:09:59,156 --> 00:10:01,374
Sergeant Douglas? E. Dicky.

86
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,220
- Country do you think?

87
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:05,380
3 meals in bed ......

88
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:08,060
warrean Pean and poetry readings every day.

89
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,201
- Do you want to stay there? - Better kill you also tend to Nazis.

90
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:14,359
- The Nazis. - that's it.

91
00:10:14,652 --> 00:10:16,584
But like the Nazis killed.

92
00:10:17,016 --> 00:10:19,023
We will go to Africa for the first time.

93
00:10:19,302 --> 00:10:22,924
We will land on the island.

94
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:25,921
Add a task?

95
00:10:26,134 --> 00:10:28,451
So do not expect him back?

96
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:32,864
- Sicily...

97
00:10:33,797 --> 00:10:35,257
I think.

98
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:41,702

99
00:10:47,811 --> 00:10:50,024
- Then leave ends. - I know.

100
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,224
Fitz Patelike, Ragusa ...

101
00:10:52,498 --> 00:10:55,581
There is no gambling, even drink beer, too.

102
00:10:55,855 --> 00:11:01,240
Jesus Christ ... he did not let me $ 20, he tangerine yesterday, do I owe you?

103
00:11:01,489 --> 00:11:03,732
Continue to the end of the game.

104
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:07,626
He let me have time, but not to win it back.

105
00:11:07,883 --> 00:11:11,123
In another language, I will once again flying to Africa

106
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,846
In order to enter back?

107
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:15,673
I do not know specifically, probably Italy.

108
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:16,994
Will ...

109
00:11:17,266 --> 00:11:20,559
He will bring Sergeant Douglas? E. Dicky you?

110
00:11:20,824 --> 00:11:22,501
Do not be carried by Sgt.

111
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,354
Lieutenant know how I feel about him.

112
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:27,756
He blew the back of his neck as adjacent roaring my shoulder.

113
00:11:28,017 --> 00:11:30,937
He growled way ....

114
00:11:31,215 --> 00:11:35,099
Lieutenant ...... Do you hear me?

115
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,251
Scream my name ......

116
00:11:43,476 --> 00:11:46,191
Leave, does not really matter.

117
00:11:48,566 --> 00:11:51,604
- good luck. - Seriously!

118
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:55,368
- I think that is a joke ah Ragusa? - No, sir.

119
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:58,848
- You Patelike? - No, sir.

120
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:04,197
This time ...

121
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,610
Please understand ...

122
00:12:08,861 --> 00:12:14,211
Against Nazi Germany, this war was more difficult ......

123
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:17,942
- We know that, sir. - very good.

124
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:21,045
This means do not understand my brother.

125
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,848
- Jesus Christ ... - Yes, sir.

126
00:12:24,409 --> 00:12:27,351
Two he let me down.

127
00:12:29,304 --> 00:12:33,252
- Give me some light beer. - Yes. He's just natural.

128
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:36,728
20 times what the spirit of Mao UPS is how fast!

129
00:12:36,988 --> 00:12:40,000
1,2,3. Then he will be honored.

130
00:12:40,261 --> 00:12:41,852
You can call their relatives ... but can not hold the phone all day, every place.

131
00:12:42,087 --> 00:12:46,147
We still do important tasks. Only one power supply goodbye.

132
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,704
Buck any more. Who we are brave.

133
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:52,563
- right? - Yes.

134
00:12:52,745 --> 00:12:56,257
And you ...... Fitz Patelike from Wyoming.

135
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:59,206
- Was found in Wyoming, what the hell not? - No, sir.

136
00:12:59,443 --> 00:13:03,282
Therefore, in practice, Wyoming Wyoming ... Wyoming What is?

137
00:13:03,605 --> 00:13:06,590
What kind of attitude ...... like you?

138
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,932
Star is considered to go camping it?

139
00:13:09,214 --> 00:13:11,990
He was right, sir.

140
00:13:18,884 --> 00:13:20,359
- All right now? - Yes.

141
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:22,527
- He did not call you? - finished.

142
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:23,964
- wait for what......?

143
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,663
- I have to go. - This...

144
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:31,197
- Remember to skip me.

145
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:47,088
He will soon return.

146
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:54,118
Too wet.

147
00:14:01,913 --> 00:14:04,328
2nd Infantry Wright ...

148
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:05,951
You want again and again to give you back?

149
00:14:06,171 --> 00:14:09,109
- I like this. - I do not know, Lieutenant.

150
00:14:09,454 --> 00:14:12,078
Well, I have more rights than

151
00:14:12,335 --> 00:14:15,326
As my wife. He did not see this

152
00:14:16,969 --> 00:14:18,127
and so......

153
00:14:18,646 --> 00:14:21,148
- We have to go ...... he - Africa. I know.

154
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:26,265
Why is no secret that I know all this?

155

You know all the things here reason, all ..

156
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,668
Ok......

157
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:42,329
This task is very dangerous.

158
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:47,658
He'll miss you, I really miss you in determining where ......

159
00:14:50,114 --> 00:14:52,012
There, he can ..

160
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,882
You may experience ...

161
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:56,907
Dangerous thing.

162
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,529
number

163
00:14:58,877 --> 00:15:01,370
But this task is very dangerous.

164
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:02,532
number

165
00:15:02,831 --> 00:15:05,302
So, you have to go.

166
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:07,609
- Yes, ah, I'm gone. - I know.

167

Sergeant continue.

00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,115
I do not know what to do?

173
00:16:00,847 --> 00:16:02,292
Well, I must say.

174
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:05,589
Who's winning?

175
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:08,095
I let him know later

176
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:11,851
Just look at the time, knew it.

- Participation is not? - Article

00:16:21,611 --> 00:16:23,322
I think that it would be better.

180
00:16:23,562 --> 00:16:26,170
What time to remember sober light.

181
00:16:26,418 --> 00:16:29,493
Well, then we have the relief guard.

182
00:16:29,827 --> 00:16:31,838

- He took everything. - Why?

187
00:16:42,099 --> 00:16:42,992
I lost him once before

188
00:16:43,108 --> 00:16:46,990
- Added two cartons of cigarettes. - all of these.

189
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,680
The stakeout here.

190
00:16:58,286 --> 00:17:02,051
And Fitz Patelike, then they must. In the summer, you should visit Mississippi.

191
00:17:02,269 --> 00:17:06,269
This is a hot fire and the people who have become more sensitive.

192
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,377
Just a little touch and the loss of control may occur.

193
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:11,465
But the atmosphere was great.

194
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,018
I have never been to Mississippi. Or base Sgt. ...

195
00:17:14,259 --> 00:17:17,234
But the sheriff said: This is certainly not pretty.

196
00:17:17,483 --> 00:17:19,596
So then you do not know the true value of life.

197
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:22,216
It's like flowers ......

198
00:17:22,493 --> 00:17:24,736
I feel like butter mixed with honey

199
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:28,282
The new bread oven and the like.

200
00:17:28,556 --> 00:17:32,011
Mississippi who do not want to find this feels like a woman does not find it?

201
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:33,505
No, sir.

202
00:17:33,738 --> 00:17:35,117
But I'm in Texas.

203
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:38,597
- Texas, Mississippi. - of course not.

204
00:17:38,963 --> 00:17:41,380
- How are you, Barnett? - No, sir.

205
00:17:41,638 --> 00:17:43,546
- Ragusa? - I'm from New York.

206
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:47,507
I followed Jackson in this mission.

207
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:50,865
So, Dicky I believe he should be.

208
00:17:51,124 --> 00:17:55,310
- So we can say that the smell of jasmine Mississippi. - Amen.

209
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:57,782
Team before landing here.

210
00:17:58,023 --> 00:17:59,906
They stayed there for about two weeks

211
00:18:00,178 --> 00:18:02,926
And explores Nazi Germany and then lost contact.

212
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:07,669
But there are two survivors, but they were arrested, including the captain.

213
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:10,034
We need to rescue it.

214
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:15,038
Your Excellency, I said to my team and with this, but ..

215
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:17,177
He has no team here?

216
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,151
This is my team.

217
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,070
I do not know how to say about the importance of this rescue.

218
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:26,901
Who is he? Why the President ...

219
00:18:27,144 --> 00:18:29,970
No, my sergeant.

220
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:33,247
Does not mean anything, sir. I think...

221
00:18:33,498 --> 00:18:35,305
Sheriff Dickey said ...

222
00:18:35,546 --> 00:18:40,054
We understand that the task of a reconnaissance team, but we have to save his team?

223
00:18:40,348 --> 00:18:45,009
Because he was going to rescue Claire? Captain Lewis.

224
00:18:46,478 --> 00:18:49,686
- I think you know him? - Our Culture Mr. Montana

225
00:18:49,941 --> 00:18:52,107
He fought bravely ......

226
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:53,426
He was not any good soldier.

227
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:56,460
He heard movement meensmeath However, Sheriff?

228
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,041
- No, sir. - No it is not.

229
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:01,268
- Only a few people know about it. - Yes, sir.

230
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:06,480
We found a dead soldier on the beach in Spain and landing plan.

231
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,070
Details were not disclosed, but ...

232
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:12,968
Operation Mincemeat Husky has a range of vital movement,

233
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:16,520
Can save thousands of UK and USA.

234
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,313
- Operation Husky star, sir?

235
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:21,420
- Sicily landing.

236
00:19:22,393 --> 00:19:26,547
Captain Lewis head meensmeath activities.

237
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:29,935
We do not know that he disclose the Nazis locked or not.

238
00:19:30,225 --> 00:19:32,779
Do you think Captain Lewis expose you?

239
00:19:33,034 --> 00:19:35,513
Therefore, we pay special attention to Captain Lewis.

240
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:39,232
A person has information Germany.

241
00:19:39,516 --> 00:19:43,158
There is absolutely spy.

242
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:46,593
This is what I hate the Nazis more than four ..

243
00:19:46,835 --> 00:19:48,589
Espionage.

244
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:52,065
Without compromise.

245
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:56,026
Husky operation will continue for 72 hours.

246
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:57,947
We can not take the risk of aircraft.

247
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,917
We can not wait so people quickly.

248
00:20:02,209 --> 00:20:06,182
Italian team will have a wait for a resistance.

249
00:20:06,727 --> 00:20:10,523
He will board more details and password.

250
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:12,718
Find Colonel Lewis ...

251
00:20:12,959 --> 00:20:15,479
And took him.

252
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,827
- this phrase. - Yes, sir.

253
00:20:18,101 --> 00:20:19,561
It is more ...

254
00:20:19,912 --> 00:20:21,473
If you find a spy ......

255
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,096
Send me goodbye.

256
00:20:24,367 --> 00:20:26,691
Yes, sir.

257
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,935
I told you before, but not at sunset.

258
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:47,099
The next drawing experience is all right to go faster.

259
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:49,783
The next will be fine, man.

260
00:20:54,237 --> 00:20:58,189
- Do not, do not ... I'm Antonio. - We certainly know?

261
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,693
Polaris is dead.

262
00:20:59,954 --> 00:21:03,145
Also, if I want to shoot brother had been dead a long time ago.

263
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:06,083
In this game, you go this time, you crazy?

264
00:21:06,418 --> 00:21:08,387
Hide boat to go there.

265
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:12,489
Let me Colonel Lewis.

266
00:21:17,907 --> 00:21:18,782
it.

267
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:22,843
But he had to go here and over the hills.

268
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,139
I did not have to go directly to star?

269
00:21:25,498 --> 00:21:27,789
There are a lot of German soldiers.

270
00:22:21,819 --> 00:22:23,750
What the hell is all this happen?

271
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,976
Italian military resistance resistance.

272
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,502
what?

273
00:22:29,741 --> 00:22:33,521
Italian military resistance. German army's offensive. We want to help them.

274
00:22:33,738 --> 00:22:35,654
Do not. We also have a responsibility.

275
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:37,955
- May not be at risk. - They are my team.

276
00:22:38,184 --> 00:22:41,895
If necessary, he can shoot me.

277
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:43,534
get it.

278
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:45,909
Observe carefully.

279
00:22:46,891 --> 00:22:48,351
How do we do it?

280
00:22:49,276 --> 00:22:52,927
This is our strength, our resolve.

281
00:23:52,043 --> 00:23:54,540
Hey, there are three German name out there

282
00:23:54,798 --> 00:23:58,103
We must be reduced. Fitz Patelike, Barnett ... his second stay here.

283
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:01,139
Wait for my signal, then let the light version

284
00:24:01,702 --> 00:24:04,625
Dickey ... Reeves parcel, he and behind them.

285
00:24:05,126 --> 00:24:08,512
The house is the first officer, and then respond.

286
00:24:09,363 --> 00:24:13,389
- Destroy Nazi ... - Yes, sir.

287
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:00,889
- Move.

288
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:37,374
Name at the outlet?

289
00:28:37,963 --> 00:28:39,423
Did not see any.

290
00:28:47,571 --> 00:28:50,023
They killed some of my teammates.

291
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:51,939
- He went to the base. - Yes.

292
00:28:52,168 --> 00:28:54,798
Catherine will go with us.

293
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:58,351
Now understand why you want to give you the same ...

294
00:28:58,575 --> 00:29:00,825
But we do not have time to take care of the child's place.

295
00:29:01,037 --> 00:29:03,146
what did he say?

296
00:29:03,734 --> 00:29:06,105
They do not want any woman to follow them.

297
00:29:06,363 --> 00:29:09,773
Because they can not resist them to slow down.

298
00:29:09,984 --> 00:29:11,285
Will ...

299
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:13,660
Since these survivors.

300
00:29:13,925 --> 00:29:15,385
What should I do?

301
00:29:16,115 --> 00:29:19,980
Barnett, you know how to do with the four-Nazis, right?

302
00:29:20,246 --> 00:29:21,607
- But I shot him.

303
00:29:21,876 --> 00:29:23,044
- Anyway.

304
00:29:23,447 --> 00:29:24,615
Wait a second.

305
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:30,379
Too cute ... This is his girlfriend.

306
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:33,673
No, I do not think she'll kiss him where it is.

307
00:30:15,496 --> 00:30:18,462
Look at this study.

308
00:30:33,388 --> 00:30:34,556
welcome.

309
00:30:37,351 --> 00:30:38,692
Antonio...

310
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:42,405
The word "hello" to say, in Italy, how could this be?

311
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:44,658
He kept saying 'hello'. She'll understand.

312
00:30:44,894 --> 00:30:46,420
Thank pizza boy.

313
00:30:46,741 --> 00:30:51,773
welcome. I'm Sergeant Douglas? E. Dicky in Mississippi.

314
00:30:54,276 --> 00:30:56,986
- Looks like she has not impressed me too? - Yes. To be sure.

315
00:30:57,254 --> 00:30:58,422
get it.

316
00:30:58,678 --> 00:31:02,509
Blood on her face looks like a beautiful rose.

317
00:31:04,098 --> 00:31:05,558
He was stupid.

318
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,083
- Are you sure? - Come on, just say go.

319
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,886
He said the blood on her face, looks like a rose.

320
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,665
You see?

321
00:31:16,912 --> 00:31:18,519
I know she likes my poetry.

322
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,914
She smells like ...

323
00:31:21,181 --> 00:31:23,310
Jasmine summer.

324
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:29,864
He said his son did not do anything small.

325
00:31:30,117 --> 00:31:35,242
I know, she did not force her attractive.

326
00:31:35,486 --> 00:31:37,019
get it.

327
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:38,881
The pizza boy.

328
00:31:39,097 --> 00:31:44,183
Asked her colleagues not think I should do?

329
00:31:45,739 --> 00:31:49,729
- He said, to touch her buttocks. - Article

330
00:31:50,226 --> 00:31:54,052
Ah ... after ...

331
00:31:58,961 --> 00:32:00,129
no problem.

332
00:32:00,453 --> 00:32:02,603
Italian women.

333
00:32:20,453 --> 00:32:32,603
(lyrics)

334
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,879
Perhaps, it will return the name?

335
00:32:52,165 --> 00:32:54,730
I guess. As the name of a movement.

336
00:32:55,847 --> 00:32:59,556
If he will return to action quiet.

337
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:03,553
His action is this ......?

338
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:05,489
Is not it?

339
00:33:06,653 --> 00:33:08,164
Absolutely.

340
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,806
do not forget...

341
00:33:10,043 --> 00:33:13,903
Family, they are my friends. These resistance.

342
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:15,602
We will not forget.

343
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:23,302
- Catherine, along with my support. - Is okay?

344
00:33:23,515 --> 00:33:28,098
Dickey and Anthony Ragusa leading to right.

345
00:33:28,343 --> 00:33:30,533
Reeves, follow me.

346
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,307
Waiting for us to see him back in.

347
00:33:32,538 --> 00:33:36,425
We will continue to erupt quietly, clear, correct?

348
00:33:41,415 --> 00:33:43,999
Who betrayed us.

349
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:45,655
who is it?

350
00:33:47,268 --> 00:33:48,230
bring it on.

351
00:33:48,446 --> 00:33:50,650
Catherine and took him away.

352
00:36:33,855 --> 00:36:37,645
Now, delete, and he was in handcuffs.

353
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:40,901
He deleted cuffs.

354
00:36:49,644 --> 00:36:51,888
At the dinner for him?

355
00:36:53,395 --> 00:36:57,413
Maria wanted to stay and eat, is not it?

356
00:37:01,724 --> 00:37:03,184
You're welcome.

357
00:37:04,977 --> 00:37:07,358
His answer is yes.

358
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:14,296
As you can see, all the hate Giuseppi in Nazi Germany.

359
00:37:14,598 --> 00:37:16,108
Nazi Germany?

360
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:22,241
People no longer Sicily like him.

361
00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:23,788
I do not believe...

362
00:37:24,016 --> 00:37:26,074
We are a region.

363
00:37:26,294 --> 00:37:28,178
He is in the south of Sicily ...

364
00:37:28,411 --> 00:37:30,641
I am in the southern United States.

365
00:37:30,874 --> 00:37:33,756
We both did not like Nazi Germany

366
00:37:33,972 --> 00:37:38,349
And appreciate the beauty of all women in Sicily.

367
00:37:39,813 --> 00:37:43,399
I want my daughter four brothers fight together.

368
00:37:43,718 --> 00:37:48,001
Joseph wanted to know whether or not the fight is not.

369
00:37:48,279 --> 00:37:52,623
Tell him, but I want to thank all of his right to stay here.

370
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,254
He was not talking about himself.

371
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,697
She hit me

372
00:37:59,925 --> 00:38:02,273
If something happened to me.

373
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,869
She knew the way to the beach.

374
00:38:06,134 --> 00:38:07,593
Come on ...

375
00:38:08,281 --> 00:38:10,178
Are you serious?

376
00:38:10,801 --> 00:38:12,249
right.

377
00:38:19,685 --> 00:38:21,205
Are you ok?

378
00:38:23,028 --> 00:38:27,973
- Shallow cup. - Shallow cup.

379
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:45,628
- But how far? - Approximately 1 mile.

380
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,763
Faster. Ragusa go first.

381
00:42:49,966 --> 00:42:52,740
Are you sure, are you here?

382
00:42:52,992 --> 00:42:56,703
I've seen two days.

383
00:42:57,284 --> 00:42:58,899
Maybe......

384
00:42:59,297 --> 00:43:01,698
This is a trap.

385
00:43:13,189 --> 00:43:14,356
get it.

386
00:43:14,632 --> 00:43:17,248
Dickey lead Fitzpatrick and Reeves.

387
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:20,113
From the north, all the way to the right.

388
00:43:20,395 --> 00:43:24,045
- Barnett Ragusa also follow me. -

389
00:43:24,622 --> 00:43:27,667
3 people left to see here.

390
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:31,389
- If so, we will follow his path. - Yes.

391
00:43:31,597 --> 00:43:32,765
bring it on.

392
00:44:38,501 --> 00:44:39,961
Captain Louis?

393
00:44:41,474 --> 00:44:42,933
2nd Infantry Wright?

394
00:44:43,744 --> 00:44:44,911
Ok...

395
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:46,770
Lieutenant me, and then ...

396
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:48,868
What are you doing here?

397
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,488
I came here to rescue the captain.

398
00:44:51,809 --> 00:44:54,473
Long way to go, just to save me?

399
00:44:54,706 --> 00:44:58,277
Well, it involves meensmeath activities.

400
00:44:58,505 --> 00:45:00,674
If he will reveal what the Germans.

401
00:45:00,923 --> 00:45:03,112
I never disclose any

402
00:45:03,323 --> 00:45:04,783
I know, captain.

403
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,314
I guess?

404
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,394
I am leaving. Faster.

405
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:24,061
Now you do not need this stuff.

406
00:45:24,867 --> 00:45:26,149
These guys ......

407
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:30,366
Also a novice only.

408
00:45:30,893 --> 00:45:33,626
The worst thing is yet to come.

409
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:35,408
Very glad to see the captain.

410
00:45:35,608 --> 00:45:37,506
I, too, Fitz.

411
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,877
Oh ...... hey ...... teams tournament here.

412
00:45:41,116 --> 00:45:43,657
Only his all, Captain.

413
00:45:43,864 --> 00:45:45,361
They hit him in the game?

414
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:46,813
No, sir,

415
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:48,878
- By boat.

416
00:45:49,145 --> 00:45:50,630
Here - Fitz boating!

417
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:52,892
I have also set up!

418
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:55,123
I was with him again

419
00:45:55,372 --> 00:45:58,014
In this case, the star?

420
00:45:59,486 --> 00:46:02,854
You have been trained, everything is so.

421
00:46:03,692 --> 00:46:05,748
There were ambushed.

422
00:46:10,277 --> 00:46:12,174
Quickly at home.

423
00:46:42,747 --> 00:46:45,831
Barnett, press firmly on the wound.

424
00:46:52,779 --> 00:46:55,714
To cover, not to be shot.

425
00:47:00,889 --> 00:47:04,355
- He is not the captain? - The deployment of his team go, hurry.

426
00:47:04,569 --> 00:47:08,924
- Ragusa, worried about the windows do not let them come closer. - Yes, sir.

427
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:12,822
came here.

428
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,170
He doing?

429
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,580
Failure to do so well, Lieutenant.

430
00:47:21,364 --> 00:47:23,592
- Get it? - Do not.

431
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:31,192
What can we do here, lieutenant?

432
00:47:31,444 --> 00:47:34,112
I will from next door.

433
00:47:48,243 --> 00:47:50,141
See this.

434
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:01,183
I......

435
00:48:01,416 --> 00:48:04,035
- Perish ...... - do not say.

436
00:48:08,061 --> 00:48:10,141
I'd rather die?

437
00:48:14,693 --> 00:48:19,218
No one should die, Lieutenant. You do not think about it.

438
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,849
He did not want to surrender it?

439
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:32,457
Ignore them, Lieutenant.

440
00:48:33,156 --> 00:48:34,260
Dickey.

441
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:37,846
Here I am very excited, Mr.

442
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,369
This is true, crazy map.

443
00:48:43,339 --> 00:48:45,304
- Ragusa. - Yes......

444
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:47,824
- We leave here. - No.

445
00:48:48,046 --> 00:48:50,421
Distracting me.

446
00:48:50,721 --> 00:48:53,582
Captain Lewis!

447
00:49:00,616 --> 00:49:03,064
Captain Lewis!

448
00:49:06,167 --> 00:49:08,064
His game?

449
00:49:08,317 --> 00:49:09,776
not real.

450
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:15,781
Where there is no hope of escape.

451
00:49:18,702 --> 00:49:23,530
Why can not convince the team to go?

452
00:49:24,525 --> 00:49:25,985
I'll treat them ......

453
00:49:26,709 --> 00:49:30,942
As one of his.

454
00:49:32,464 --> 00:49:33,781
He said that this is it anyway?

455
00:49:33,976 --> 00:49:37,154
A friendly Nazi ... "Feng? Claus."

456
00:49:37,399 --> 00:49:40,210
Not exactly a friendly name, but ......

457
00:49:40,546 --> 00:49:45,935
- We can try. - I can not have very friendly.

458
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:50,705
Captain Lewis Come on!

459
00:49:51,612 --> 00:49:53,450
Just believe me.

460
00:49:54,303 --> 00:49:57,206
End then.

461
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:03,825
A damn guy.

462
00:50:06,846 --> 00:50:08,108
Hey!

463
00:50:08,352 --> 00:50:10,223
Monkey!

464
00:50:11,348 --> 00:50:14,935
I kiss the butt.

465
00:50:33,871 --> 00:50:35,548
Not funny star.

466
00:50:40,496 --> 00:50:43,216
Now, Apple's birthday.

467
00:50:43,465 --> 00:50:45,656
Not our asses.

468
00:50:51,771 --> 00:50:53,445
Catherine on this side.

469
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:56,693
Caterine這里。

470
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:21,385
- Set up. - bring it on.

471
00:51:21,594 --> 00:51:23,134
leave this place.

472
00:51:27,948 --> 00:51:30,028
Out the door. let us go.

473
00:51:34,243 --> 00:51:36,182
Go! Go! Go.

474
00:51:45,606 --> 00:51:46,774
Damn

475
00:51:57,911 --> 00:52:00,402
Go ...... Come on, get out of here.

476
00:52:00,938 --> 00:52:03,144
Color out of here, go ...

477
00:52:09,262 --> 00:52:11,160
Go ...... go ......

478
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:18,515
Americans go go go.

479
00:52:20,058 --> 00:52:21,621
Going, going ......

480
00:52:56,897 --> 00:53:00,506
- Antonio Where? - Anthony, Antonio ...

481
00:53:20,621 --> 00:53:22,836
Antonio, come on!

482
00:53:48,603 --> 00:53:50,562
American named Alpha 6 ... 7

483
00:53:50,819 --> 00:53:53,542
I believe Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.

484
00:53:53,762 --> 00:53:57,391
Project received. Street.

485
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:00,846
261 Eco Delta Bravo ...

486
00:54:02,174 --> 00:54:05,200
Yes. Mr President, I will come back to convey.

487
00:54:06,979 --> 00:54:09,056
This activity is still in progress.

488
00:54:09,276 --> 00:54:12,408
They will send someone to meet us.

489
00:54:15,182 --> 00:54:19,454
The location is on the coast.

490
00:54:20,082 --> 00:54:22,535
We need a shelter. Antonio!

491
00:54:22,772 --> 00:54:26,819
For stays undetected and needs reinforcements, easy

492
00:54:27,142 --> 00:54:29,310
There is a small bar near here.

493
00:54:29,601 --> 00:54:31,272
Located in the east of the valley.

494
00:54:31,571 --> 00:54:34,957
No, I need something bigger.

495
00:54:36,999 --> 00:54:38,148
Not so?

496
00:54:38,392 --> 00:54:42,044
I found an abandoned village. If not, there is.

497
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:43,621
There is no game?

498
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:45,700
no more.

499
00:54:47,012 --> 00:54:48,125
what?

500
00:54:48,336 --> 00:54:51,445
There bombing of a village.

501
00:54:51,695 --> 00:54:54,248
- No one lives here. - Is it far?

502
00:54:54,574 --> 00:54:57,055
About half a mile southeast.

503
00:55:00,624 --> 00:55:03,036
- He led the way.

504
00:55:51,224 --> 00:55:52,683
- Stop it.

505
00:55:53,965 --> 00:55:57,282
Captain Lewis put three people in other ways.

506
00:55:57,568 --> 00:55:59,463
Take them away.

507
00:56:16,958 --> 00:56:18,534
Ragusa.

508
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:48,550
Barnett.

509
00:57:14,042 --> 00:57:15,209
He said.

510
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,329
an examination.

511
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,148
Dickey.

512
00:58:16,053 --> 00:58:17,513
be careful.

513
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:36,251
Barnett.

514
00:58:38,055 --> 00:58:39,515
Yes.

515
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,682
- Everything captain, but empty? - none of them.

516
00:59:10,398 --> 00:59:14,109
Captain Lewis met with what?

517
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:15,929
I do not know.

518
00:59:18,314 --> 00:59:20,916
Was very panic

519
00:59:21,844 --> 00:59:23,782
I ran.

520
00:59:27,975 --> 00:59:30,637
I know you do not like it?

521
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:33,825
His people?

522
00:59:35,296 --> 00:59:36,756
can.

523
00:59:38,673 --> 00:59:42,440
They are nothing more than a family.

524
00:59:43,640 --> 00:59:46,330
We can also all the poor ...

525
00:59:47,131 --> 00:59:49,710
He also married you?

526
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:52,311
Yes.

527
00:59:55,307 --> 00:59:57,205
They leave ......

528
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:01,767
Or stay?

529
01:00:03,783 --> 01:00:06,645
They do not think he is correct?

530
01:00:08,283 --> 01:00:09,451
number

531
01:00:11,429 --> 01:00:13,327
I joined the resistance ...

532
01:00:14,112 --> 01:00:16,010
Because I think ...

533
01:00:16,234 --> 01:00:19,662
The fight was good for the country, his people.

534
01:00:22,113 --> 01:00:23,237
but......

535
01:00:23,414 --> 01:00:26,812
My hometown, a poor country.

536
01:00:27,558 --> 01:00:30,530
So in my village in Germany ......

537
01:00:30,731 --> 01:00:33,537
We require our food supply.

538
01:00:34,717 --> 01:00:37,153
Register or find me ... too poor.

539
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,325
Nothing to eat.

540
01:00:40,398 --> 01:00:43,488
So the Germans will not forgive those who killed him.

541
01:00:45,257 --> 01:00:47,502
That's why I came.

542
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:10,820
Captain Louis.

543
01:01:11,766 --> 01:01:13,664
What are you doing here?

544
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:19,009
- Where to find you. - I'm here, sir.

545
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:25,670
- Are there any? - Yes.

546
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:29,315
You want to drink a glass of cold beer, sir?

547
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:34,511
- To replace. - So, I'm fine. Thank you for your attention.

548
01:01:35,136 --> 01:01:36,925
His teammates how?

549
01:01:37,462 --> 01:01:41,707
They will do everything possible to fight in the end.

550
01:01:42,005 --> 01:01:43,801
Other maintained.

551
01:01:44,138 --> 01:01:46,741
Norway, I've heard of it.

552
01:01:46,982 --> 01:01:49,719
God knows that we have a place.

553
01:01:50,124 --> 01:01:51,808
We come from is not important

554
01:01:52,014 --> 01:01:54,913
Soldiers like you

555
01:01:55,301 --> 01:01:57,491
Would be very helpful if my order ....

556
01:01:57,729 --> 01:01:59,881
- Very useful. - thank you.

557
01:02:01,402 --> 01:02:04,460
- A damn place. - Very warm, jazz ......

558
01:02:14,656 --> 01:02:15,823
Drink away.

559
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:19,719
wait a minute.

560
01:02:19,992 --> 01:02:23,142
You do not have to rush.

561
01:02:25,722 --> 01:02:27,523
She had other people do?

562
01:02:31,339 --> 01:02:33,240
I want to tell her ...

563
01:02:33,515 --> 01:02:37,475
Mississippi sunset no match for her.

564
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:41,715
She brings such a warm spring smell.

565
01:02:42,015 --> 01:02:44,872
But she did not want to know me instead.

566
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:47,317
He killed more Nazis?

567
01:02:47,916 --> 01:02:51,791
I do not understand what she said but great sound.

568
01:02:52,024 --> 01:02:52,926
he......

569
01:02:53,156 --> 01:02:56,324
What killed ...... ...... et

570
01:02:56,629 --> 01:02:58,513
...... Nazi killing us.

571
01:02:58,825 --> 01:03:01,014
I killed a lot of Nazis do.

572
01:03:01,251 --> 01:03:03,149
So like baseball.

573
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:04,523
There was ...

574
01:03:05,028 --> 01:03:06,336
In military operations

575
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,491
The middle of a desolate place.

576
01:03:09,569 --> 01:03:13,057
How will I go a few feet

577
01:03:13,284 --> 01:03:16,122
He was pleasantly surprised bullet

578
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:21,351
The entire neck, blood flow haze.

579
01:03:23,620 --> 01:03:25,322
I want to help him.

580
01:03:25,574 --> 01:03:28,982
But I want to see that bastard.

581
01:03:29,412 --> 01:03:32,129
I knew he was hiding somewhere on the rocks.

582
01:03:32,343 --> 01:03:34,054
Fourth, we are dealing with

583
01:03:35,337 --> 01:03:37,199
I team brief eruption

584
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:40,909
I do not want to forgive him

585
01:03:41,137 --> 01:03:43,732
Weapons in hand, I was winding cliff

586
01:03:43,982 --> 01:03:46,306
I finally found him

587
01:03:48,786 --> 01:03:50,246
Do not care...

588
01:03:52,131 --> 01:03:55,578
You know, I looked down at him

589
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:59,418
He looked at me with horror

590
01:04:00,882 --> 01:04:03,441
Try to draw his weapon

591
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:07,315
I began to burn him

592
01:04:07,550 --> 01:04:11,076
I saw the pain of death

593
01:04:13,944 --> 01:04:18,750
No sound scary English people died in the fire ..

594
01:04:19,146 --> 01:04:20,421
then......

595
01:04:20,659 --> 01:04:22,376
Smell it ...

596
01:04:22,586 --> 01:04:25,135
Smoldering fire,

597
01:04:25,706 --> 01:04:28,566
I found in his pocket.

598
01:04:28,795 --> 01:04:30,984
Recent photographs.

599
01:04:31,412 --> 01:04:33,375
A beautiful wife

600
01:04:33,757 --> 01:04:35,741
And a little baby boy

601
01:04:38,385 --> 01:04:40,574
this is...

602
01:04:41,057 --> 01:04:44,729
I feel very bad when the Nazis killed one.

603
01:04:45,763 --> 01:04:48,293
But he killed my lieutenant.

604
01:04:48,499 --> 01:04:50,738
Damn him.

605
01:04:57,001 --> 01:04:58,314
Nazi...

606
01:04:59,644 --> 01:05:01,791
I will be their eggs.

607
01:05:04,405 --> 01:05:08,729
I'm sorry

608
01:05:20,822 --> 01:05:22,261
Relaxing distance.

609
01:05:22,642 --> 01:05:24,986
Then they want.

610
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,243
Ragusa ... Dickey to see.

611
01:05:30,075 --> 01:05:31,535
Antonio.

612
01:05:33,332 --> 01:05:36,126
He went looking for Patelike card Trina?

613
01:05:36,359 --> 01:05:39,318
- Katelina Fitz Patelike to find. - Who?

614
01:05:39,533 --> 01:05:42,822
- This is a great American. - No, let me go.

615
01:05:43,075 --> 01:05:44,972
I do not intend to leave.

616
01:05:45,384 --> 01:05:47,360
Has proved to be useful, not people.

617
01:05:48,672 --> 01:05:51,118
Do not go longer than Captain?

618
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,522
I was there, then the site.

619
01:05:54,092 --> 01:05:57,458
- They come in the right time. - Ok.

620
01:06:00,645 --> 01:06:04,144
Let me go ... check to see how the gun.

621
01:06:11,264 --> 01:06:12,724
team leader......

622
01:06:14,909 --> 01:06:17,456
What gun place to check.

623
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:20,639
I think he came here to see better.

624
01:06:21,274 --> 01:06:23,084
Ah, it looks like this.

625
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:26,989
I can help him, Antonio?

626
01:06:27,201 --> 01:06:30,855
- I'm here to help him. - I do not have to help him.

627
01:06:31,084 --> 01:06:32,544
Never mind

628
01:06:32,926 --> 01:06:34,824
Let me see.

629
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:38,335
Backup person to go.

630
01:06:38,845 --> 01:06:42,035
- He wants the previous command, Captain star? - The original ...

631
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:47,870
After what happened to us the last time ... I'm sorry if I did not polite.

632
01:06:48,198 --> 01:06:49,898
What happened there?

633
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:51,468
You're viewing.

634
01:06:51,724 --> 01:06:55,567
Germany, too, we know why?

635
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,701
As I said ...

636
01:06:59,217 --> 01:07:01,115
You're viewing.

637
01:07:03,146 --> 01:07:06,048
His family game here, Captain?

638
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,521
His uncle, right?

639
01:07:11,192 --> 01:07:13,057
Or grandmother?

640
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:18,131
They tied the game, captain?

641
01:07:19,729 --> 01:07:22,623
He stood them.

642
01:07:27,315 --> 01:07:30,157
Maybe I was because of money.

643
01:07:36,962 --> 01:07:39,340
We are almost done

644
01:07:48,918 --> 01:07:51,726
you are so brilliant.

645
01:08:06,763 --> 01:08:09,907
I blinked for a moment I will see Anthony.

646
01:08:10,149 --> 01:08:12,850
He did not do the place. team leader. I'll see.

647
01:08:13,062 --> 01:08:16,439
- He should take over. - Thank you, Fitz.

648
01:08:54,028 --> 01:08:55,488
bring it on.

649
01:08:56,081 --> 01:08:57,912
Time is no longer a vacation.

650
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:02,840
Then, it will be fine.

651
01:09:05,203 --> 01:09:07,802
Where is his 80 seconds. team leader?

652
01:09:09,844 --> 01:09:11,304
I do not know.

653
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:16,091
What do you think?

654
01:09:27,954 --> 01:09:31,623
PINTU 7, this is Alpha 6 ...

655
01:09:35,543 --> 01:09:41,301
We are waiting for reinforcements. We were trapped on the island. 80 seconds late for it?

656
01:09:46,122 --> 01:09:48,558
Floor plan How?

657
01:09:52,186 --> 01:09:53,918
I know.

658
01:10:00,159 --> 01:10:01,327
get it.

659
01:10:06,764 --> 01:10:10,120
Therefore, in the South China Sea Fleet of the half.

660
01:10:10,327 --> 01:10:15,474
Half of the islands in the air strike, I had to take a boat again.

661
01:10:15,976 --> 01:10:18,859
How to swim?

662
01:10:19,495 --> 01:10:22,596
And how on the shore.

663
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,513
And ... will not support our troops.

664
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:30,611
- Infantry? - They will also attend.

665
01:10:30,853 --> 01:10:35,289
So here we sit there and wait for 80 seconds.

666
01:10:36,867 --> 01:10:40,325
If you can get out of here, where we can ship.

667
01:10:40,931 --> 01:10:43,368
He came out, instead of going to hang Anthony.

668
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:47,693
- Tell him always listen to the program. - Yes.

669
01:10:54,953 --> 01:10:56,413
This is Wright.

670
01:10:57,126 --> 01:11:01,006
I think about Anthony acting suspiciously.

671
01:11:04,808 --> 01:11:08,586
He is the only place where we landed, but actually I do not know.

672
01:11:08,801 --> 01:11:12,114
When we were ambushed and then he disappeared.

673
01:11:12,417 --> 01:11:13,784
They seem to know all the news.

674
01:11:14,056 --> 01:11:16,666
And our business plan.

675
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:19,989
However, these plans are unknown Anthony even so.

676
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:23,671
He saw the map.

677
01:11:25,172 --> 01:11:28,100
- But he can speak German. - I know.

678
01:11:28,306 --> 01:11:29,945
Me too, I remember you?

679
01:11:30,159 --> 01:11:31,068
listen.

680
01:11:31,343 --> 01:11:33,779
I believe he will be tougher in its decision, lieutenant.

681
01:11:34,086 --> 01:11:36,682
Do not forget, you are in any country.

682
01:11:37,003 --> 01:11:39,581
And he fought.

683
01:11:41,860 --> 01:11:44,464
I know, captain.

684
01:11:50,546 --> 01:11:53,750
- Our Germans. - where is it? - In the town.

685
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:04,070
All done? follow me. Quiet, softly.

686
01:12:58,026 --> 01:13:00,743
- Anthony in the end how to do? - I do not know. I do not see anywhere.

687
01:13:00,955 --> 01:13:02,282
Not surprised ...

688
01:13:02,477 --> 01:13:03,879
Note found him slightly.

689
01:13:04,082 --> 01:13:06,664
What, then shoot each scene.

690
01:13:10,887 --> 01:13:13,702
Lieutenant, then the arrival of reinforcements landed along the coast.

691
01:13:13,951 --> 01:13:15,411
get it.

692
01:15:13,055 --> 01:15:14,898
Barnett, he was at the door.

693
01:15:15,101 --> 01:15:17,690
Katrina, in my opinion.

694
01:21:19,220 --> 01:21:21,118
Hey, I'm here, Fitz.

695
01:21:21,553 --> 01:21:23,086
We damn Nazis.

696
01:21:26,106 --> 01:21:27,565
very good.

697
01:21:44,506 --> 01:21:46,925
- Oh shit. - I run and ammunition

698
01:21:47,182 --> 01:21:51,474
- I will be here to get more. - Captain, the Germans put the gun away.

699
01:22:03,788 --> 01:22:05,128
Fitz, and then I run out of ammunition.

700
01:22:05,350 --> 01:22:08,437
I have a lot of people do, Captain. What he needed, just put.

701
01:22:20,090 --> 01:22:21,258
Fitz.

702
01:22:21,455 --> 01:22:23,098
Do you copy?

703
01:22:25,617 --> 01:22:27,077
Oh my God......

704
01:23:36,019 --> 01:23:38,011
bring it on. Withdrawal.

705
01:23:38,295 --> 01:23:39,755
Any faster.

706
01:23:47,084 --> 01:23:49,432
damn it.

707
01:23:50,524 --> 01:23:51,692
Ragusa.

708
01:23:52,222 --> 01:23:53,795
- let me see. - Article

709
01:23:53,992 --> 01:23:55,582
Come, sit here.

710
01:23:55,784 --> 01:23:58,319
Come on, I have to leave here.

711
01:23:58,509 --> 01:24:01,274
I caught him. Come on, get up to do, ...

712
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:03,729
Come on, get out of here.

713
01:24:04,145 --> 01:24:06,054
- Hey ... - no, let me ...

714
01:24:18,278 --> 01:24:21,235
Come, my friends, do not give up, try to do so.

715
01:24:22,303 --> 01:24:24,511
Alright alright.

716
01:24:24,724 --> 01:24:26,833
You listen to the angels, because any

717
01:24:27,044 --> 01:24:29,361
She sang his name

718
01:24:29,566 --> 01:24:32,037
Ragusa stay with me. stay with me......

719
01:24:32,232 --> 01:24:33,841
Hey, you help me.

720
01:24:34,008 --> 01:24:35,363
Come on ...

721
01:24:41,334 --> 01:24:42,794
How fast

722
01:24:46,841 --> 01:24:48,613
bring it on.

723
01:24:49,368 --> 01:24:50,536
He located here.

724
01:24:50,807 --> 01:24:52,773
- Back. - bring it on

725
01:24:54,228 --> 01:24:55,371
We can not here.

726
01:24:55,787 --> 01:24:56,951
We too close.

727
01:24:57,117 --> 01:24:58,205
Mao a boat.

728
01:25:00,510 --> 01:25:01,976
To Ragusa.

729
01:25:02,179 --> 01:25:04,358
How fast we go.

730
01:26:10,309 --> 01:26:13,044
As Captain Lewis, I knew from the outset.

731
01:26:13,253 --> 01:26:15,591
- Fitz Patelike? - He killed them.

732
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:16,826
Antonio?

733
01:26:17,026 --> 01:26:20,937
Antonio, Fitz Patelike, he is.

734
01:26:23,621 --> 01:26:25,081
Allow me at the beach.

735
01:26:25,376 --> 01:26:26,481
I will lead them to the old ways.

736
01:26:28,513 --> 01:26:31,907
Let the sea. Faster.

737
01:26:32,429 --> 01:26:34,307
leave this place.

738
01:27:14,149 --> 01:27:15,609
Faster.

739
01:27:16,437 --> 01:27:18,099
came here.

740
01:29:18,781 --> 01:29:20,241
Come on, this direction.

741
01:29:38,846 --> 01:29:40,943
Back to the ship, Lieutenant.

742
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:43,313
His task has failed.

743
01:29:43,547 --> 01:29:44,714
why?

744
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:45,995
why?

745
01:29:46,418 --> 01:29:49,839
Because I have 40 years of active constraints but they still sent me to.

746
01:29:50,025 --> 01:29:50,916
Myself...

747
01:29:51,010 --> 01:29:53,864
I'm only going on duty.

748
01:29:54,064 --> 01:29:56,049
Plan just ...

749
01:29:56,283 --> 01:29:59,322
They have no reason to die.

750
01:29:59,639 --> 01:30:01,560
This is war ......

751
01:30:02,039 --> 01:30:04,218
Day, but no one was killed.

752
01:30:04,458 --> 01:30:07,407
For no reason.

753
01:30:19,384 --> 01:30:21,535
Not my style.

754
01:33:50,215 --> 01:33:52,007
Get the boat.

755
01:33:52,199 --> 01:33:53,633
There can not be hidden.

756
01:33:53,831 --> 01:33:54,999
go with.

757
01:38:00,268 --> 01:38:02,567
Mississippi 1945

758
01:38:12,366 --> 01:38:14,860
I miss him very much.

759
01:38:15,257 --> 01:38:17,044
Isabel ...

760
01:38:17,624 --> 01:38:21,819
Your mother would be proud to see grown children.

761
01:38:22,032 --> 01:38:23,283
Thank you for your father.

762
01:38:23,592 --> 01:38:26,057
The boy was unable to avoid it?

763
01:38:26,288 --> 01:38:27,539
Yes!

764
01:38:31,646 --> 01:38:34,762
get it. This hug his father.

765
01:38:36,310 --> 01:38:38,208
I love Tim said.

766
01:38:39,048 --> 01:38:40,706
Daddy loves you.

767
01:38:40,967 --> 01:38:44,577
Lovely ... father forget the pain.

768
01:38:44,914 --> 01:38:48,265
I'm home. Too long.

769
01:38:48,566 --> 01:38:52,664
Dad told her about Lieutenant Wright, right?

770
01:38:52,985 --> 01:38:53,909
Yes.

771
01:38:53,941 --> 01:38:56,798
About time.
