to revolutionize healthcare
and change lives.

27
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,935
By participating in this trial,

28
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,404
you'd have the opportunity
to impact hundreds,

29
00:02:50,437 --> 00:02:53,741
if not thousands of
lives for the better.

30
00:02:53,775 --> 00:02:54,709

Mr. Leblanc, Mr.
Leblanc, please!

34
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:15,663
This is so embarrassing.

35
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:17,364
I'm sorry, I didn't
realize this is...

36
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,365
I did.

37
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,300
I recommended you.

38
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,969
Look, Dr. Howard in Baton Rouge

39
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,471
is doing a massive
anti-aging study,

40
00:03:24,505 --> 00:03:28,408
and it's making it difficult
to get enough volunteers.

41
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,544
Now, I happen to be good friends

42
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:31,244
with your general practitioner,

43
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,280
and I asked him a
couple weeks ago

44
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:35,550
to put in a good word
about this trial to you.

45
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,884
You what?

46
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:38,786
Look, despite the...

47
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:41,656
Issues...

48
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:46,527
That I had with you, I just
knew with the tissue damage

49
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:51,532
that you had, you'd be a perfect
candidate for this trial.

50
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,568
You can't possibly be serious.

51
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,469
Look, I'm desperate.

52
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:58,506
Lauden's got me over a barrel,
I'm barely scraping by.

53
00:03:58,539 --> 00:04:01,843
I'm self-funding this
out of my own pocket.

54
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:02,710
No.

55
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:04,045
Absolutely not.

56
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,412
Mr. Leblanc please.

57
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,048
Look, it's Jack, all right?

58
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:08,683
And you didn't have any problem

59
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:10,985
calling me Jack in
court, remember?

60
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:13,921
So don't bother
being all formal now.

61
00:04:13,955 --> 00:04:16,591
Jack, look, your hesitation

62
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,993
is noted and it's
understandable.

63
00:04:19,026 --> 00:04:20,494
We won't have to see each other

64
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:22,897
except during the daily exams.

65
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,600
Look at it as something
that's mutually beneficial

66
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,334
for both of us.

67
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:28,468
No way.

68
00:04:28,503 --> 00:04:30,370
This is crazy

69
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,841
I promise you won't
be the control patient.

70
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:37,011
It's not a double-blind study.

71
00:04:37,044 --> 00:04:38,946
What does that even mean?

72
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,582
It means I can promise you
you won't be on the placebo.

73
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:44,018
You won't be wasting your time.

74
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:46,053
Probably doesn't even work

75
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:47,522
It works.

76
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:48,421
I promise.

77
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:51,626
Think of the good this could do.

78
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,594
I'm begging you.

79
00:04:53,628 --> 00:04:54,494
Please.

80
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:57,698
Okay.

81
00:05:06,574 --> 00:05:08,743
Da hell that was all about?

82
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,377
Where the fuck you been?

83
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,680
Where are the rest
of the volunteers?

84
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,347
Seems like you lookin' at us.

85
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:17,952
The few, the proud,
the guinea pigs.

86
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,822
Good morning, I'm
Dr. James Walsh.

87
00:05:20,855 --> 00:05:23,090
I'm gonna be your
principle investigator

88
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,992
for the duration of the trial.

89
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:29,362
A little about me, I've been
a pharmacologist for 25 years.

90
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:32,465
I've dabbled mostly in
biochemistry and oncology.

91
00:05:32,499 --> 00:05:34,367
I've also developed
three different

92
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:37,705
over-the-counter medications
that are on the market today.

93
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,641
I have here something
that's called

94
00:05:40,675 --> 00:05:42,743
an informed consent form.

95
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,645
This will explain everything
that you need to know

96
00:05:44,679 --> 00:05:47,815
about what's gonna
happen with this trial.

97
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:48,950
Take a look at them.

98
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:51,052
Did I die and go to heaven?

99
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,789
I hate to break
it to you, buddy.

100
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:57,058
I don't think that's
where you're going.

101
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,491
Oh, fuck you.

102
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,364
I'm gonna get me one.

103
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:08,035
Oh, wow, very
progressive of you

104
00:06:08,069 --> 00:06:11,172
I didn't think
she was your type.

105
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,573
It's cool, man.

106
00:06:12,607 --> 00:06:13,674
Love is love.

107
00:06:15,810 --> 00:06:18,411
You're here to participate
in a ground-breaking

108
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,847
clinical trial.

109
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,583
The code name for it is Obsidian

110
00:06:22,617 --> 00:06:24,484
for the color of the formula.

111
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,154
It can help fix things
like cleft palettes,

112
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:30,725
surgical incisions,
stretch marks, scars.

113
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,961
The possibilities
for it are limitless.

114
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,098
Any questions so far?

115
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:40,868
Hey sugar-tits, you single?

116
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,803
[man laughs]

117
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:43,971
Nice gloves.

118
00:06:45,006 --> 00:06:45,973
What can I say?

119
00:06:46,007 --> 00:06:47,875
I'm a trend-setter.

120
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:51,812
What'd you dig those out
of the trash can at the gym?

121
00:06:53,614 --> 00:06:56,951
Does it look like I work
out at a gym, asshole?

122
00:06:56,984 --> 00:06:58,119
All right.

123
00:06:58,152 --> 00:06:59,954
Any actual questions?

124
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:04,558
[Man] When do we get paid?

125
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,694
At the conclusion
of the trial.

126
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:07,695
What the fuck, man?

127
00:07:07,728 --> 00:07:09,597
I got bills to pay.

128
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:10,731
Wait, we're not getting
paid for almost a month?

129
00:07:10,765 --> 00:07:13,534
Well, three weeks, yes.

130
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,870
Man, there is a
lot of things listed

131
00:07:15,903 --> 00:07:17,972
under potential side effects.

132
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:19,874
Is this even safe?

133
00:07:19,907 --> 00:07:21,609
Well, the whole purpose
of the trial is to test out

134
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,145
the safety and
effectiveness of the drug.

135
00:07:24,178 --> 00:07:26,247
So by signing this,
means we understand

136
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,082
that this thing could kill us?

137
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:29,984
And we're doing
this on the good faith

138
00:07:30,017 --> 00:07:32,219
that if we don't die, we'll
get paid in several weeks?

139
00:07:32,253 --> 00:07:36,223
Look, the results in the
animal trials have been amazing.

140
00:07:36,257 --> 00:07:38,159
Yeah, I'm sure.

141
00:07:38,192 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm out.

142
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:42,630
Peace.

143
00:07:44,565 --> 00:07:45,766
Yeah, me too.

144
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:53,774
For those of you remaining,
I have parking passes for you.

145
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:56,911
One of the possible
side effects of the drug

146
00:07:56,944 --> 00:07:59,580
is blurred vision,
and so legally,

147
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:02,183
I can't allow you to
get behind the wheel.

148
00:08:02,216 --> 00:08:05,553
So wait, we ain't
staying here at the hotel?

149
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:06,721
Even better.

150
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:14,762
So, wanna see where you're
gonna be the next few weeks?

151
00:08:14,795 --> 00:08:15,663
Follow me.

152
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:37,651
Don't mind me.

153
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:38,686
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:43,758
Dammit.

155
00:08:45,326 --> 00:08:47,995
[solemn music]

156
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,610
Over there on the
right is Bayou Conway.

157
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:04,078
If you like cat
fishing, there's a great

158
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:05,913
catfishing hole there.

159
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,049
You're welcome to borrow
my rods and tackle

160
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,850
in the shed if you want to.

161
00:09:09,884 --> 00:09:11,685
It's peaceful here.

162
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:14,989
I can get used to this.

163
00:09:15,022 --> 00:09:17,925
[creature breathing heavily]

164
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,360
[Dr. Walsh] There's
also some kayaks

165
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,096
back behind the first cabin.

166
00:09:22,129 --> 00:09:24,865
There's also a serene hiking
trail there if you're,

167
00:09:24,899 --> 00:09:26,967
you know, into that sorta thing.

168
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,903
What's in there?

169
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:31,305
Nothing, I haven't used
that building in years.

170
00:09:31,338 --> 00:09:32,640
Really?

171
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,075
Something just moved inside.

172
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,110
I mean, this is Louisiana.

173
00:09:36,143 --> 00:09:40,214
There could be any number
of critters back there.

174
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:45,152
Okay guys, why don't
you come on in.

175
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,858
Aww, man.

176
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:52,893
Are you fuckin' serious?

177
00:09:54,695 --> 00:09:57,932
Son of a bitch, it's gonna
be a long three weeks.

178
00:09:57,965 --> 00:10:01,035
All right, we'll come
back for the bags later.

179
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:03,270
Let's go buddy, piggy back.

180
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:11,679
Welcome to my Louisiana oasis.

181
00:10:11,712 --> 00:10:14,849
Over there is some bug
spray if you need that.

182
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:18,385
Back over there you'll find
some candles and lighters.

183
00:10:18,419 --> 00:10:21,055
We sometimes have trouble
with the power going out,

184
00:10:21,088 --> 00:10:22,890
but its nothing to worry about.

185
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,758
Usually I'ts fixed easily
enough by a breaker.

186
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,162
Also the patient journals,
make sure you fill out

187
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:32,800
how you're doing every day
so I can track your progress.

188
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:35,736
We've got security cams, one
over there and one over here

189
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,138
and throughout the property.

190
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:38,772
Legally, we really
have to do it.

191
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,941
I mean, this is a
co-ed situation,

192
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,244
so we need to do that
for harassment issues

193
00:10:43,277 --> 00:10:46,147
and also if any slip and
fall accidents happen.

194
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:47,348
Tomorrow morning
at eight o'clock,

195
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:48,983
the shuttle will
be picking us up

196
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:51,285
to take us to the
St. James Infirmary.

197
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,422
Because Obsidian is
formulated to only deal with

198
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:59,393
damaged tissue, but not
healthy and healed tissue,

199
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:01,262
we're gonna have to
go in and re-open

200
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:04,198
or re-score your damaged areas.

201
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:06,934
Now, I know this procedure
may bother you a little bit.

202
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:09,003
There may be some
discomfort with it.

203
00:11:09,036 --> 00:11:10,771
But believe me, I'm
gonna do everything I can

204
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,239
to try to prevent that.

205
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:15,342
Now in the coming days,
in my office over there

206
00:11:15,376 --> 00:11:17,211
back across the field, I'll
be checking your vitals

207
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,346
and also freshening
your bandages.

208
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,249
Now by the way, cell
service is pretty spotty,

209
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:25,186
if almost non-existent,
so if you need to make

210
00:11:25,219 --> 00:11:27,221
any personal calls,
believe it or not,

211
00:11:27,254 --> 00:11:28,856
we have a land line here.

212
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:31,158
You can feel free to
use it if you'd like.

213
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:34,295
All I need from you is to make
sure that you get settled in,

214
00:11:34,328 --> 00:11:36,797
get plenty of rest,
because tomorrow,

215
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,801
bright and early, we're
gonna make history.

216
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:45,839
["Linea De Sangre De La
Locura" by Cast Into Ruin]

217
00:12:04,325 --> 00:12:06,193
My God, did you guys see this?

218
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:09,363
Side effects may include,
but are not limited to,

219
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:12,399
fever, nausea,
insomnia, aggression,

220
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:18,005
stomach pain, blurred
vision, depression,

221
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:21,175
thoughts of suicide,
hallucinations...

222
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:24,211
Why can't drugs like
ever give you like,

223
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,413
good side effects?

224
00:12:26,447 --> 00:12:28,115
Like fuckin' night vision.

225
00:12:28,148 --> 00:12:29,416
Spontaneous orgasms.

226
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,818
Yeah!

227
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,019
[both laughing]

228
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,187
[Chase] What about the ability

229
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,257
to see through peoples clothing?

230
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,793
Not sure that would always
be a good side effect, bro.

231
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:44,331
Speaking of seeing through
clothes, where's Eileen at?

232
00:12:44,365 --> 00:12:46,834
I'll tell you what,
Walsh ain't the only one

233
00:12:46,867 --> 00:12:48,836
that's gonna be playin'
doctor with her.

234
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:49,970
Please.

235
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:51,839
She's so way out of your league.

236
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:54,275
Why, 'cause I'm
in a fuckin' chair?

237
00:12:54,308 --> 00:12:57,278
I pull more tail than a
slow kid at a petting zoo.

238
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,246
Probably can't even
get hard anymore.

239
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,147
Hey!

240
00:13:01,516 --> 00:13:03,951
Prick, this fucking
dick still works.

241
00:13:03,984 --> 00:13:05,252
And this tongue.

242
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:10,457
Plus these 10 magical
fingers that aim to please.

243
00:13:10,491 --> 00:13:11,992
Yeah, how else do
you think he wore out

244
00:13:12,026 --> 00:13:13,827
the fingers on those gloves?

245
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,263
Why you fuckers always busting
my balls about my gloves?

246
00:13:16,297 --> 00:13:17,264
Honestly?

247
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:18,399
We're all jealous.

248
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:20,034
Yeah, they're pretty retro.

249
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,936
You look like one of
those '80s jock guys.

250
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,607
This chick over here bustin'
my balls about my gloves,

251
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:30,110
it's 90 degrees and she's
wearing a fuckin' sweater.

252
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,421
[Chase] Everything okay?

253
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:41,322
Yeah.

254
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,991
Just don't feel like
getting eye-fucked

255
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,459
by a faggot while eating is all.

256
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,894
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

257
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48,028
It's all good.

258
00:13:48,062 --> 00:13:50,197
Studies show men are homophobic

259
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,367
due to their own
latent homosexuality.

260
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:58,372
Look, just keep
your limp-wristed,

261
00:13:58,405 --> 00:14:02,443
glittery little paws off
me, and we'll be just fine.

262
00:14:02,476 --> 00:14:05,012
You do realize what
year this is, right?

263
00:14:05,045 --> 00:14:06,614
Like they can marry
and everything now.

264
00:14:06,648 --> 00:14:08,282
Don't even get me
started on that shit.

265
00:14:08,315 --> 00:14:09,350
You know, Leviticus for-

266
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:10,918
- Leviticus?

267
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:12,386
Leviticus?

268
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:14,021
Of course.

269
00:14:14,054 --> 00:14:16,890
Leviticus states, "a
man should not lie

270
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:20,160
with man as he
lies with a woman."

271
00:14:20,194 --> 00:14:23,263
You know what
Leviticus also forbids?

272
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:26,400
Having your hair unkempt.

273
00:14:26,433 --> 00:14:28,135
Bearing a grudge.

274
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,671
Mixing fabrics.

275
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,306
All of which you're
guilty of right now.

276
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:36,176
Picking and choosing the parts
of the religion that suit you

277
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,447
doesn't make you pious,
it makes you a hypocrite.

278
00:14:40,481 --> 00:14:43,217
[dish clatters]

279
00:14:49,223 --> 00:14:51,024
Hey, hey, hey!

280
00:14:51,058 --> 00:14:52,126
There she is.

281
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,496
We were just talking about you.

282
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:56,698
Good things, I hope.

283
00:14:56,731 --> 00:14:57,665
Oh, very.

284
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,404
So, I'm looking around,
and I can't really tell

285
00:15:03,437 --> 00:15:05,372
what anyone's here for.

286
00:15:07,675 --> 00:15:08,610
Except you.

287
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:10,944
No offense.

288
00:15:12,547 --> 00:15:13,981
Well, I got these two
matching beauties right here

289
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,250
from some ugly Irish asshole.

290
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:19,654
Two surgeries, four
near-death infections.

291
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:24,324
Yet here I am, gorgeous as ever.

292
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,963
Dog bite.

293
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:32,366
Never try to break up a
fight between two big dogs.

294
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,367
Ooh.

295
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,736
That look like it hurt.

296
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,270
Want me to massage that for you?

297
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:37,171
Pass.

298
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,139
C'mon!

299
00:15:39,173 --> 00:15:40,974
My fingers are magical.

300
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,711
My husband teaches jiu jitsu.

301
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:45,613
Yeah, cool story, babe.

302
00:15:45,647 --> 00:15:47,314
He can watch if he wants,
if he's into that shit.

303
00:15:47,347 --> 00:15:48,683
In your dreams.

304
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:53,086
What about you, beautiful?

305
00:15:54,021 --> 00:15:56,190
[lighter clicking]

306
00:15:56,223 --> 00:16:00,027
Jesus, Mick, that's
not a fucking toy, man.

307
00:16:03,096 --> 00:16:05,332
C'mon, drama queen!

308
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,367
Fuckin' joke's on you.

309
00:16:07,401 --> 00:16:09,403
I'm outta smokes anyway.

310
00:16:11,606 --> 00:16:14,542
[mysterious music]

311
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,119
[Iris] Sorry.

312
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,622
Can't sleep either?

313
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:29,423
You can come in.

314
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:30,290
I don't bite.

315
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:32,159
[Iris] Okay.

316
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:35,195
Yeah, I had an impromptu
nap right before orientation,

317
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,699
so now I'm all wired-for-sound.

318
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:40,267
Cool origami.

319
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:43,705
I suck.

320
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,540
[both laugh]

321
00:16:45,573 --> 00:16:48,676
[Iris] I'm going
out to the patio.

322
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,777
Care to join?

323
00:16:51,445 --> 00:16:52,312
Okay.

324
00:16:53,447 --> 00:16:54,314
Okay.

325
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,756
[fire crackling]

326
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,090
[insects chirping]

327
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,626
Thanks for coming out here.

328
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:07,160
I was feeling a bit caged.

329
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,397
Sorry if I caused problems
between you and Mick.

330
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:13,267
Oh, no no no no no,
no, Mick's cool as hell.

331
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,303
He definitely forgot
about that already.

332
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,706
Have you guys known
each other a long time?

333
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,508
Yeah, a couple years now.

334
00:17:20,542 --> 00:17:23,076
I'd take a bullet for
that cranky bastard.

335
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,112
How'd you meet?

336
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:25,813
Rehab.

337
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:30,785
Oh, like, drugs or
alcohol addiction?

338
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:33,420
No, sex addiction, actually.

339
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,124
Yeah.

340
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:37,825
Oh.

341
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:41,295
You should see the
look on your face.

342
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:45,198
No, like, rehab as
in physical therapy.

343
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,201
- Oh, gotcha.
- That was so bad, I'm sorry.

344
00:17:48,235 --> 00:17:49,804
[Iris] No, you got me.

345
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:52,205
[Iris laughing]

346
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:54,374
Yeah, we both had our
injuries around the same time,

347
00:17:54,408 --> 00:17:58,211
and we did PT together
at the same facility,

348
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:02,115
and we've been really
good friends ever since.

349
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:07,254
God, I really hope this
doesn't make things awkward

350
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:11,358
for the next few weeks,
but you are so beautiful.

351
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:15,697
Stop.

352
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:18,198
No, I'm serious, I'm like,
I've been wracking my mind,

353
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:22,837
I'm trying to figure out like
why you would even be here.

354
00:18:24,672 --> 00:18:28,141
I just want to look in the
mirror and feel normal again.

355
00:18:28,175 --> 00:18:29,777
[Jack] Normal?

356
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:31,445
Looking at you right
now, I literally cant see

357
00:18:31,478 --> 00:18:33,313
one single thing that's
wrong with you, I mean-

358
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:34,314
- Stop.

564

Shit, probably
five bucks a pop.

565

Oxys on the other hand, I can
move that hillbilly heroin

566

567
00:30:35,436 --> 00:30:36,470
What about these?

568
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:37,471
It's a muscle relaxer.

569

How much for these?

570
00:30:41,643 --> 00:30:43,877
Shit, these are only $3.

571
00:30:43,911 --> 00:30:45,012
[Mick] $3?

572
00:30:45,045 --> 00:30:46,447
$3 is $3.

573
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,950

get rid of these?

574
00:30:49,983 --> 00:30:50,984
Of course.

575
00:30:55,122 --> 00:30:57,925
Get rid of those and I'll
see what I can scrounge up.

576
00:30:57,958 --> 00:31:00,060
You know, maybe fake an
injury and get Dr. Kavorkian

577
00:31:00,094 --> 00:31:01,929
to write me a script.

578
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:05,232
Yeah, yeah, hey, see if you
can get any Addys or Rids.

579
00:31:05,265 --> 00:31:07,501
I got this one rich
bitch uptown, Kelly,

580
00:31:07,535 --> 00:31:10,971
she'll buy the whole damned
bottle of either in one shot.

581
00:31:11,004 --> 00:31:14,208
This cunt needs uppers like
I need a hole in the head.

582
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:17,612
But her cash spends the
same as everyone else's.

583
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,980
Plus it ain't hard to fake ADHD.

584
00:31:20,013 --> 00:31:24,251
In fact, Mick, you may
already legit have that shit.

585
00:31:28,455 --> 00:31:29,323
Placebo?

586
00:31:30,658 --> 00:31:33,927
Yeah, it's like, sugar pill.

587
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,931
Walsh gives like one patient
a sugar pill, placebo,

588
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:42,903
and he then gives like, another
patient like the real pill.

589
00:31:44,639 --> 00:31:47,074
I mean, that's bullshit.

590
00:31:47,107 --> 00:31:48,041
Nah, why?

591
00:31:49,644 --> 00:31:53,681
Because that means one of
them's there wasting their time.

592
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:55,650
Yeah, and they have the
privilege of getting paid.

593
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:57,652
It's why I'm here.

594
00:31:57,685 --> 00:31:59,687
But if that shit
works, that means

595
00:31:59,721 --> 00:32:02,256
someone's getting
cut up for no reason,

596
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,691
and they just gotta
sit there and watch

597
00:32:03,725 --> 00:32:05,259
everyone else heal
in front of 'em.

598
00:32:05,292 --> 00:32:06,260

want me to do about it?

the two bottles.

random chance of gettin' 'em.

613

genius or a moron sometimes.

- Oh my god!

716
00:40:03,537 --> 00:40:05,973
That means it's working!

717
00:40:06,007 --> 00:40:07,942
I'm so happy for you.

719
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:31,999
No.

720

It's fine.

721
00:40:36,137 --> 00:40:38,139

- Hey girl!
- Jesus!

724
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,893
You were almost wearing these!

725
00:40:58,926 --> 00:41:00,828
Hey, calm your tits.

726
00:41:00,861 --> 00:41:02,663
About last night.

727
00:41:02,697 --> 00:41:04,065
Wow.

728
00:41:04,098 --> 00:41:05,199
The hell are
you talking about?

729
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:06,801
Don't play coy with me.

730
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,202
I don't know
how many languages

731
00:41:08,235 --> 00:41:09,804
I need to tell you
this in, but you and I

732
00:41:09,837 --> 00:41:10,938
are never going to happen.

733
00:41:10,972 --> 00:41:12,506
What are you worried about?

734
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,274
I'm gonna tell your husband?

735
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:14,275
He ain't here.

736
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:15,643
Tell him what?!

737
00:41:15,676 --> 00:41:17,178
About last night.

738
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:19,113
The three amazing
orgasms you had.

739
00:41:19,146 --> 00:41:21,248
I have no clue what
you're talking about.

740
00:41:21,282 --> 00:41:23,184
Oh, you're gonna pretend
like it didn't happen

741
00:41:23,217 --> 00:41:25,219
because you're too
fuckin' proud to admit

742
00:41:25,252 --> 00:41:27,154
you banged a low-life cripple?

743
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:29,757
Dude, you are
straight-up delusional.

744
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,559
You know, hallucinations
are supposedly

745
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:32,960
one of the side effects.

746
00:41:32,994 --> 00:41:36,564
Better get Walsh
to check your head.

747
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:37,732
[Jack] What's the
first thing you'd do

748
00:41:37,765 --> 00:41:40,234
if you could walk again?

749
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:44,705
Oh, I'd say this
mornin' I'd take Eileen,

750
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,941
bend her over that
kitchen island,

751
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,876
put it in her guts
like I did last night.

752
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:51,178
But she can rot in hell.

753
00:41:51,212 --> 00:41:53,981
Last night, she come to my room,

754
00:41:54,015 --> 00:41:56,017
I ate her out for
like two hours.

755
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,284
- What?
- Yeah.

756
00:41:57,318 --> 00:41:58,619
Then we fucked.

757
00:41:58,652 --> 00:42:00,921
Made her cum like three times.

758
00:42:00,955 --> 00:42:02,957
Now she's got fuckin'
amnesia this mornin'.

759
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,325
Get the fuck outta here.

760
00:42:04,358 --> 00:42:05,960
C'mon, man.

761
00:42:05,993 --> 00:42:07,795
Jack, swear on
my mother's grave.

762
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:09,630
Your mother's alive dude.

763
00:42:09,663 --> 00:42:10,965
She lives in Chalmette!

764
00:42:10,998 --> 00:42:12,600
[Mick] Regardless.

765
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:13,734
Getting back to your
original question.

766
00:42:13,768 --> 00:42:15,736
[Jack] Yes, thank you.

[Jack] Golf, really?

770
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:20,841
Yeah, you know.

771
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:24,712
Or make like some
fast cash, you know.

772
00:42:24,745 --> 00:42:26,080

so he don't kick me
out on my fuckin' ass.

775
00:42:30,017 --> 00:42:31,118
You did tell him
you're getting paid

776
00:42:31,152 --> 00:42:32,820
for the trial soon, right?

777
00:42:32,853 --> 00:42:36,190
He said that it was
too long of a wait.

778
00:42:37,892 --> 00:42:38,759
It itches.

779
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:42,630
That means it's healing, right?

780
00:42:42,663 --> 00:42:43,330
Yeah.

781
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,737
Hey man, don't worry.

782
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:51,172
You gon' heal up too.

00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:53,941
Probably on the
fuckin' placebo.

to really play this game?

Yes, I do.

lets keep it straight.

- I'm the nickel.

805

just smoke weed now?

00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:39,920
is if we actually had
the real pieces for this.

Was it comfortable?

01:17:05,826 --> 01:17:06,794
No.

1427
01:17:06,827 --> 01:17:08,162
Good luck in there.

1428
01:17:15,202 --> 01:17:16,170
Hey.

1429
01:17:16,203 --> 01:17:18,105
I'm headed out soon.

1430
01:17:18,139 --> 01:17:19,907
Just wanted to check up on
you, see how you're doing.

1431
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:21,175
Where you headed?

1432
01:17:21,208 --> 01:17:22,309
Home.

1433
01:17:22,343 --> 01:17:25,179
I'm dropping out of the trial.

1434
01:17:25,212 --> 01:17:28,916
Oh, this day keeps
getting better and better.

1435
01:17:28,949 --> 01:17:29,950
Can you...

1436
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:34,021
- Nah.
- I'm so sorry.

1437
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:36,924
Ah, I squandered
my only chance.

1438
01:17:39,026 --> 01:17:39,994
[Eileen] You know,
you were taller

1439
01:17:40,027 --> 01:17:41,695
than I thought you'd be.

1440
01:17:41,729 --> 01:17:42,396
Yeah?

1441
01:17:44,265 --> 01:17:48,202
I wish there was something
I could do to cheer you up.

1442
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:52,006
I'm sure if we could
put our heads together,

1443
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:55,843
we could think of
somethin', but I don't think

1444
01:17:55,876 --> 01:17:58,345
your husband would
like that too much.

1445
01:17:58,379 --> 01:18:02,316
I don't see him anywhere
around here, do you?

1446
01:18:06,754 --> 01:18:09,290
[ominous music]

1447
01:18:21,468 --> 01:18:24,305
[Chase] Alan, don't you
think you've had enough?

1448
01:18:24,338 --> 01:18:26,874
[Alan] Oh, you think so?

1449
01:18:26,907 --> 01:18:30,077
[Chase] I know it' s
scary being out the closet.

1450
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:31,979
[Alan] I'm not in
the fucking closet!

1451
01:18:32,012 --> 01:18:34,215
I'm not a fucking faggot!

1452
01:18:34,248 --> 01:18:35,082
I get it.

1453
01:18:35,115 --> 01:18:36,050
You're confused.

1454
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,117
You're drunk.

1455
01:18:38,252 --> 01:18:39,086
[Alan shouts]

1456
01:18:39,119 --> 01:18:40,221
Stop!

1457
01:18:40,254 --> 01:18:41,855
[Alan] What, is it my looks?

1458
01:18:41,889 --> 01:18:43,525
Am I just not hot
enough for you?

1459
01:18:43,558 --> 01:18:45,459
You're a fucking psycho.

1460
01:18:45,492 --> 01:18:48,095
[Alan] I'll show you psycho!

1461
01:18:49,196 --> 01:18:50,798
[both grunting]

1462
01:18:50,831 --> 01:18:51,966
[Alan] Stop!

1463
01:18:57,104 --> 01:18:59,541
[manchoking]

1464
01:18:59,574 --> 01:19:01,308
Did you hear that?

1465
01:19:02,577 --> 01:19:04,111
[Mick] Shut up.

1466
01:19:15,489 --> 01:19:18,158
[Chase crying]

1467
01:19:21,295 --> 01:19:22,830
What the fuck?!

1468
01:19:24,331 --> 01:19:26,467
What the fuck did you do?!

1469
01:19:33,874 --> 01:19:36,210
Chase, what the fuck
did you do, man?!

1470
01:19:36,243 --> 01:19:37,177
God, c'mon!

1471
01:19:38,212 --> 01:19:40,347
Iris, go get help!

1472
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:41,248
God!

1473
01:19:43,217 --> 01:19:44,084
C'mon!

1474
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:48,022

[Chase gasps]

1478
01:20:25,225 --> 01:20:26,628
What?

1479
01:20:26,661 --> 01:20:27,995
What the fuck?

1480
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,397
What?!

1481
01:20:30,431 --> 01:20:33,300

[Mick shouting]

1483
01:20:49,483 --> 01:20:50,451
[Mick] No!

1484
01:20:50,484 --> 01:20:51,452
No!

1485
01:20:51,485 --> 01:20:52,353
No!

[creature squeals]

1487
01:21:17,411 --> 01:21:19,647
- Iris, what's going on?
- I can't get a dial tone!

1488
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:20,515
All right, lets go!

1489
01:21:20,548 --> 01:21:21,382
We gotta go!

1490
01:21:21,415 --> 01:21:22,249
Fuck the phone!

1491

Let's go!

1492
01:21:23,283 --> 01:21:24,118
We gotta get out!

[Mick shouts]

1494
01:21:25,018 --> 01:21:25,653
Oh my god!

1495
01:21:25,687 --> 01:21:27,321
Go find Walsh!

[Mick shouts]

1500
01:21:41,201 --> 01:21:42,069

[eerie music]

1511
01:22:19,541 --> 01:22:20,407

[insects chirping]

No, no, no.

1515
01:22:34,188 --> 01:22:35,322
Oh, Mick.

1516
01:22:35,355 --> 01:22:36,323
No.

1517
01:22:36,356 --> 01:22:37,991
No, Mick!

01:22:50,738 --> 01:22:52,306
No!

No, Mick, no, Mick,
Mick! [sobbing]

1521
01:22:57,679 --> 01:23:00,414
What the hell is going on, man?!

1522
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:03,651
What the fuck?!

1523
01:23:07,254 --> 01:23:09,657
[Iris crying]

1524
01:23:16,564 --> 01:23:18,131

[banging on door]
[Iris gasping]

1526
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:21,603
Iris, are you okay?

1527
01:23:21,636 --> 01:23:23,270
No, no, no.

[insects chirping]

1529
01:23:28,375 --> 01:23:29,376
It's okay.

1530
01:23:33,347 --> 01:23:35,048
Where the fuck is
his head, man?!

1531
01:23:35,082 --> 01:23:37,652
What the fuck is going on, man?!

1532
01:23:37,685 --> 01:23:40,287
- I don't know!
- What is this?

1533
01:23:45,693 --> 01:23:48,095
I can't see, its too dark.

1534
01:23:48,128 --> 01:23:50,230
What does it say?

1535
01:23:50,264 --> 01:23:53,668
"I have seen
the devil himself.

1536
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:57,104
He lives not within a creature,

1537
01:23:57,137 --> 01:23:59,507
but in the man who
claimed Jessica's life.

1538
01:23:59,541 --> 01:24:01,408
When he nearly
killed my daughter,

1539
01:24:01,441 --> 01:24:04,311
he ripped my family
and career to shreds.

1540
01:24:04,344 --> 01:24:06,446
I gave her the
medication before knowing

1541
01:24:06,480 --> 01:24:09,449
of the subsequent deformities.

1542
01:24:09,483 --> 01:24:13,420
Jessica was transformed into
a beast of my own creation.

1543
01:24:13,453 --> 01:24:16,724
In my lust for revenge,
I spread to many

1544
01:24:18,258 --> 01:24:21,029
the hellish malady
intended for only..."

1545
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:23,330
Jesus.

1546
01:24:23,363 --> 01:24:24,231
What?

1547
01:24:25,165 --> 01:24:26,333
"...Jack Leblanc".

1548
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:27,234
What?!

1549
01:24:28,870 --> 01:24:32,172
"I needed him to
suffer like she did.

1550
01:24:32,205 --> 01:24:35,142
I know not how the
others became afflicted.

1551
01:24:35,175 --> 01:24:37,712
I only know its too
late for them now.

1552
01:24:37,745 --> 01:24:41,348
These innocent patients are
cursed, unable to escape

1553
01:24:41,381 --> 01:24:43,551
the outbreak of these
demonic transformations.

1554
01:24:43,585 --> 01:24:45,653
I'm sorry for everything.

1555
01:24:47,522 --> 01:24:51,291
Whoever finds this, I beg of
you this one final request.

1556
01:24:53,828 --> 01:24:56,396
Don't hurt my daughter."

1557
01:24:56,430 --> 01:24:57,297
What the fuck?!

1558
01:24:57,331 --> 01:24:58,432
What?!

1559
01:24:58,465 --> 01:25:00,300
What?

1560
01:25:00,334 --> 01:25:01,669
- You killed Walsh's daughter?
- Listen, listen, Iris.

1561
01:25:01,703 --> 01:25:03,236
Listen to me, Iris!

1562
01:25:03,270 --> 01:25:04,906
It was an accident!

1563
01:25:04,939 --> 01:25:07,140
Why was he talking about
her like she was still alive?

1564
01:25:07,174 --> 01:25:08,475
I don't know.

1565
01:25:08,509 --> 01:25:09,711
- What the fuck?
- I know.

1566
01:25:09,744 --> 01:25:11,244
Iris, let me explain.

1567
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:12,379
Please.

1568
01:25:12,412 --> 01:25:13,246
Just stay away from me!

Oh my god!

1575
01:25:24,726 --> 01:25:26,326
Get the fuck back!

1576
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,762
Get the fuck back!

1577
01:25:33,266 --> 01:25:34,134
Get back!

1578
01:25:42,342 --> 01:25:43,544
It's the flame.

1579
01:25:44,444 --> 01:25:45,312
Here.

1580
01:25:47,414 --> 01:25:48,281
Jessica?

1581
01:25:50,818 --> 01:25:52,252
Here.

[tense music]

1583
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:56,791
It's okay.

1584
01:25:57,892 --> 01:25:58,760
Here.

1585
01:26:10,303 --> 01:26:11,506
It's the flame.

1586
01:26:23,685 --> 01:26:24,519
Run!

1587
01:26:24,552 --> 01:26:25,419
Let's go!

1596
01:27:42,395 --> 01:27:43,865
Iris, Iris, we have to
keep it together, okay?

1597
01:27:43,898 --> 01:27:45,066
If we lose our shit,
we're not making it

1598
01:27:45,099 --> 01:27:46,734
outta here alive, okay?

1599
01:27:46,768 --> 01:27:50,638
Why didn't you tell me
about Walsh's daughter?

1600
01:27:50,671 --> 01:27:52,507
Because I'm ashamed.

1601
01:27:52,540 --> 01:27:54,809
It's not something I
like to just go around

1602
01:27:54,842 --> 01:27:56,611
advertising about, all right?

1603
01:27:56,644 --> 01:27:58,311
It was an accident!

1604
01:27:59,714 --> 01:28:03,518
I was driving and a dog
ran out in front of me,

1605
01:28:03,551 --> 01:28:06,554
and I ran off the
road, and my wife,

1606

Kate, she died on impact.

1607
01:28:12,593 --> 01:28:16,731
And Jessica, she was just
out looking for her dog.

1608
01:28:18,065 --> 01:28:19,867
Look, not a day
goes by that I don't

1609
01:28:19,901 --> 01:28:21,903
hate myself for what happened!

1610
01:28:21,936 --> 01:28:23,503
Okay?

1611
01:28:23,538 --> 01:28:24,705
If I could trade my life
with either of them,

1612
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:26,040
I would in a second!

1613
01:28:26,073 --> 01:28:27,440
[thudding on walls]

1614
01:28:27,474 --> 01:28:28,475
Oh my god!

1615
01:28:28,509 --> 01:28:29,342
Fuck!

1616
01:28:29,376 --> 01:28:30,711
We're fucked!

1617
01:28:30,745 --> 01:28:32,847
We have to barricade
the door, c'mon!

1618
01:28:32,880 --> 01:28:34,649
Help me with this.

1619
01:28:34,682 --> 01:28:36,017
And I'm gonna find us
something to fight back with,

1620
01:28:36,050 --> 01:28:36,884
all right?

1621
01:28:36,918 --> 01:28:37,752
Wait right here.

1622
01:28:37,785 --> 01:28:39,620
[both gasping]

1623
01:28:39,654 --> 01:28:43,825
I'm gonna find something
for us to fight with, okay?

1624
01:28:44,892 --> 01:28:46,727
[creature screeching]

1625
01:28:46,761 --> 01:28:48,629
What did the file say?

1626
01:28:51,065 --> 01:28:52,066
It's a patient file.

1627
01:28:52,099 --> 01:28:53,668
Jessica Walsh.

1628
01:28:53,701 --> 01:28:55,368
After two weeks of
being on a ventilator,

1629
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,004
the hospital released
her to Walsh.

1630
01:28:57,038 --> 01:29:00,141
Walsh took her home,
administered her Obsidian,

1631
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:03,144
after a week, all of
her wounds had healed,

1632
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:05,513
everything except for the burns.

1633
01:29:05,546 --> 01:29:07,548
Day eight, she
awoke from a coma.

1634
01:29:07,582 --> 01:29:09,851
Day nine, there's a picture.

1635
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:16,057
[scratching on walls]

1636
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:27,068
Day 10....

1637
01:29:28,936 --> 01:29:31,973
He tried to kill her with
lethal doses of pain meds.

1638
01:29:32,006 --> 01:29:33,808
Jesus.

1639
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:37,612
That didn't work, he
tried to sever her carotid,

1640
01:29:37,645 --> 01:29:42,449
but the cut, being exposed to
the air, seemed to fuel it.

1641
01:29:43,684 --> 01:29:44,552
God!

1642
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:48,522
Fuck, this is insane!

1643
01:29:48,556 --> 01:29:51,092
He did some tests on lab rats...

1644
01:30:00,167 --> 01:30:03,137
[creature growling]

1645
01:30:05,506 --> 01:30:08,075
And concluded that
fire was the only thing

1646
01:30:08,109 --> 01:30:12,613
that seemed to kill the
transformative tissue for good.

1647
01:30:12,647 --> 01:30:13,514
Fuck.

1648
01:30:15,116 --> 01:30:17,919
[metal scraping]

1649
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:20,655
Well then, why keep
that thing around?

1650
01:30:20,688 --> 01:30:22,523
I don't understand.

1651
01:30:22,556 --> 01:30:25,526
Because it's
still his daughter.

1652
01:30:25,559 --> 01:30:28,396
No, no, that
thing wasn't human.

1653
01:30:30,064 --> 01:30:32,199
Maybe not now, but he
still sees it as Jessica.

1654
01:30:32,233 --> 01:30:34,101
He probably lost his nerve.

1655
01:30:34,135 --> 01:30:37,138
Well, does it say anything
about like the lab rats

1656
01:30:37,171 --> 01:30:39,540
or like Walsh working
on a cure for it, or-

1657
01:30:39,573 --> 01:30:40,975
- No!

1658
01:30:41,008 --> 01:30:42,910
Or like antidotes
or fucking anything?!

1659
01:30:42,944 --> 01:30:44,712
No, there's nothing!

1660
01:30:44,745 --> 01:30:45,880
- It's-
- Dammit!

1661
01:30:49,016 --> 01:30:49,884
Yes!

1662
01:30:53,020 --> 01:30:55,756
Yes! [laughing]

1663
01:30:57,525 --> 01:30:58,826
Are you kidding me?

1664
01:30:58,859 --> 01:30:59,727
God!

1665
01:31:00,728 --> 01:31:01,896
Fuck!

1666
01:31:01,929 --> 01:31:02,763
God!

1667
01:31:02,797 --> 01:31:03,998
Leave us alone!

1668
01:31:05,733 --> 01:31:07,868
There has to be another
way out of here!

1669
01:31:07,902 --> 01:31:10,604
Okay, but Iris, maybe Walsh
was right in the letter.

1670
01:31:10,638 --> 01:31:12,206
Maybe this has to stop here.

1671
01:31:12,239 --> 01:31:14,608
Maybe we can't let it out there,

1672
01:31:14,642 --> 01:31:19,180
because we'll be unleashing
it, and spreading it!

1673
01:31:19,213 --> 01:31:24,018
I mean, you didn't see what
happened to Alan, or to Mick.

1674
01:31:25,653 --> 01:31:26,954
Well, maybe they
can quarantine us

1675
01:31:26,988 --> 01:31:28,823
until they find an answer.

1676
01:31:28,856 --> 01:31:31,058
Maybe there's someone out
there that can fix us!

1677
01:31:31,092 --> 01:31:32,860
Who's going to fix us?

1678
01:31:32,893 --> 01:31:35,262
- There's no cure, Iris!
- We can try!

1679
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:36,897
There's no way to fix us!

1680
01:31:36,931 --> 01:31:38,265
We have to try!

1681
01:31:38,299 --> 01:31:39,667
Do we?

1682
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,269
Look, whoever we
go to to fix us,

1683
01:31:42,303 --> 01:31:44,739
all they're gonna
do is dissect us

1684
01:31:44,772 --> 01:31:47,308
like fuckin' lab rats, okay?

1685
01:31:47,341 --> 01:31:51,545
They're gonna poke and
fucking prod at us!

1686
01:31:51,579 --> 01:31:52,246
Like...

1687
01:31:54,181 --> 01:31:55,850
Before they kill us?

1688
01:31:55,883 --> 01:31:58,085
Or they just give
up on us, okay?

1689
01:31:58,119 --> 01:32:02,890
Nobody's gonna help us, and
I'm not doing this, Iris!

1690
01:32:02,923 --> 01:32:06,794
I'm not gonna life my life like
an animal in a fuckin' cage.

1691
01:32:06,827 --> 01:32:11,298
I've already done this for
the past five fucking years!

1692
01:32:11,332 --> 01:32:14,068
And I'm done, nobody
deserves that life.

1693
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:16,303
We don't deserve that life.

1694
01:32:18,339 --> 01:32:19,173
We don't.

1695
01:32:20,241 --> 01:32:21,108
I'm done.

1696
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:27,181
They're in us, Iris.

1697
01:32:27,214 --> 01:32:29,083
And we are not getting
outta here alive.

1698
01:32:29,116 --> 01:32:32,286
But we can keep
it from spreading.

1699
01:32:32,319 --> 01:32:33,187
How?

1700
01:32:34,388 --> 01:32:36,057
[metal scraping]

1701
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:38,192
We could end this.

1702
01:32:38,225 --> 01:32:39,894
Right here and now.

1703
01:32:40,895 --> 01:32:41,962
On our terms.

1704
01:32:43,664 --> 01:32:44,598
You and me.

1705
01:32:46,133 --> 01:32:49,603
You saw what it did
with the fire, okay?

1706
01:32:52,339 --> 01:32:55,843
It healed everybody except
for me and my burns.

1707
01:32:55,876 --> 01:32:58,279
That's no coincidence.

1708
01:32:58,312 --> 01:33:02,249
[creature screeching]

1709
01:33:02,283 --> 01:33:05,152
[banging on wall]

1710
01:33:06,353 --> 01:33:07,621
Fuck, Jack.

1711
01:33:10,124 --> 01:33:13,060
[metal scratching]

1712
01:33:26,841 --> 01:33:29,343
[dramatic music]

1713
01:33:29,376 --> 01:33:34,381
[gasoline splashing]
[Iris crying]

1714
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:38,479
Iris, I love you.

1715
01:34:38,513 --> 01:34:40,147
I love you.

1716
01:34:40,181 --> 01:34:45,186
[dramatic music]
[flames crackling]

1717
01:34:56,397 --> 01:34:58,365
[both screaming]

1718
01:34:58,399 --> 01:35:01,135
[horns honking]

1719
01:35:02,336 --> 01:35:03,404
[Eddie] Hey, no.

1720
01:35:03,437 --> 01:35:04,772
- No way.
- I understand.

1721
01:35:04,805 --> 01:35:05,773
Hey.

1722
01:35:05,806 --> 01:35:06,774
Hey, have you seen Mick?

1723
01:35:06,807 --> 01:35:07,441
Sir, calm down.

1724
01:35:07,474 --> 01:35:08,442
You seen Mick?

1725
01:35:08,475 --> 01:35:09,777
No, you calm down!

1726
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:10,878
My friend Mick is in there!

1727
01:35:10,911 --> 01:35:12,112
He's my only friend!

1728
01:35:12,146 --> 01:35:13,113
I understand your concern.

1729
01:35:13,147 --> 01:35:14,982
That's bullshit!

1730
01:35:15,015 --> 01:35:16,116
Just 'cause you got that
goddamn badge on your chest,

1731
01:35:16,150 --> 01:35:17,284
that don't mean shit to me!

1732
01:35:17,318 --> 01:35:18,919
I ain't afraid of that!

1733
01:35:18,953 --> 01:35:20,354
Mick's in there,
that's my friend!

1734
01:35:20,387 --> 01:35:22,122
[Officer] Step away
from the line, sir!

1735
01:35:22,156 --> 01:35:23,324
[Eddie] You don't understand,
that's my only friend!

1736
01:35:23,357 --> 01:35:25,059
I need some help over here.

1737
01:35:25,092 --> 01:35:27,895
I'm suing both
of you for assault.

1738
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:30,864
You'll see, this won't
be the last of me!

1739
01:35:30,898 --> 01:35:32,766
We are back now.

1740
01:35:32,800 --> 01:35:35,035
There's been a fire at the
old St. James Infirmary

1741
01:35:35,069 --> 01:35:37,104
in downtown Paulina.

1742
01:35:37,137 --> 01:35:40,274
Now, officials received a
call from a trucker passing by

1743
01:35:40,307 --> 01:35:43,143
around 4:20 a.m.
who stated he saw

1744
01:35:43,177 --> 01:35:46,280
one of the buildings
on the property ablaze.

1745
01:35:46,313 --> 01:35:49,016
Now, police have parts of
Babin Avenue blocked off,

1746
01:35:49,049 --> 01:35:52,152
but right now, we are
told the fire is now out.

1747
01:35:52,186 --> 01:35:54,822
Now, this property belongs
to noted pharmacologist

1748
01:35:54,855 --> 01:35:57,525
Dr. James Walsh, who
was allegedly running

1749
01:35:57,559 --> 01:36:01,328
a private clinical trial,
despite the revocation

1750
01:36:01,362 --> 01:36:04,898
of his medical license
three years prior.

1751
01:36:16,277 --> 01:36:18,012
I don't feel good.

1752
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,316
[Dr. Walsh] I know, monkey.

1753
01:36:22,349 --> 01:36:23,951
My stomach hurts

1754
01:36:26,954 --> 01:36:28,422
Why do I stay here!

1755
01:36:30,257 --> 01:36:32,359
[Dr. Walsh] I wish I could
let you out, but I just can't.

1756
01:36:32,393 --> 01:36:34,261
- Why?!
- I just can't.

1757
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:37,164
Tell me why!

1758
01:36:37,197 --> 01:36:38,299
[Dr. Walsh] You're
gonna hurt yourself,

1759
01:36:38,332 --> 01:36:39,166
you're gonna hurt others.

1760
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:40,568
Tell me!

1761
01:36:40,602 --> 01:36:42,604
[Dr. Walsh] You're not well.

1762
01:36:42,637 --> 01:36:43,605
Jesus!

1763
01:36:43,638 --> 01:36:45,272
Take a look at this!

1764
01:36:45,306 --> 01:36:48,242
[Jessica grunting]

1765
01:36:51,912 --> 01:36:55,282
[Jessica grunting and panting]

1766
01:37:04,992 --> 01:37:07,595
[sheep bleating]

1767
01:37:12,433 --> 01:37:16,070
Oh, you're only 20
minutes late this time.

1768
01:37:16,103 --> 01:37:18,205
Gorgeous as ever, Kelly.

1769
01:37:18,238 --> 01:37:19,973
I wish I could say
the same for you.

1770
01:37:20,007 --> 01:37:21,408
You're unkempt.

1771
01:37:21,442 --> 01:37:23,143
Same old Kelly.

1772
01:37:23,177 --> 01:37:24,978
Don't say old, please

1773
01:37:25,012 --> 01:37:29,183
Ah, I didn't mean anything
by it, you look great.

1774
01:37:29,216 --> 01:37:31,118
I'm falling apart.

1775
01:37:31,151 --> 01:37:33,387
Time is unkind and unforgiving.

1776
01:37:33,420 --> 01:37:36,490
Spackling on the makeup is
a full time job, it seems.

1777
01:37:36,524 --> 01:37:38,992
But I'm intrigued about
these little miracle pills.

1778
01:37:39,026 --> 01:37:40,461
I'm getting them for a friend.

1779
01:37:40,494 --> 01:37:42,463
Fell off a horse as
a child, poor thing.

1780
01:37:42,496 --> 01:37:43,897
Nasty scar.

1781
01:37:43,931 --> 01:37:45,132
It's unsightly.

1782
01:37:46,467 --> 01:37:48,402
But if they work as
good as you say they do,

1783
01:37:48,435 --> 01:37:50,237
I might keep a few for myself.

1784
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,473
Oh, I got 15 of 'em left.

1785
01:38:03,350 --> 01:38:04,952
Name your price.

1786
01:38:16,531 --> 01:38:19,233
You spell Finn
with one N or two?

1787
01:38:19,266 --> 01:38:22,336
You spell it C-A-S-H.

1788
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:34,682
Like always, a pleasure.

1789
01:38:37,418 --> 01:38:40,053
Just for the record, you
look every bit as good

1790
01:38:40,087 --> 01:38:43,525
as you did during
your modeling days.

1791
01:38:43,558 --> 01:38:45,959
I still have some of
the old nudie magazines

1792
01:38:45,993 --> 01:38:48,162
hanging around the house.

1793
01:38:48,195 --> 01:38:50,598
Time's an unmerciful bitch.

1794
01:38:50,632 --> 01:38:54,334
You can spend as much
time and money as you want

1795
01:38:54,368 --> 01:38:55,703
chasing after it.

1796
01:38:57,572 --> 01:39:01,975
But I can tell you right
now, you look just fine

1797
01:39:02,009 --> 01:39:03,410
just like you are.
