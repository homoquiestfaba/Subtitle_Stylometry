00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,268
- Just give me some time.

00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:11,736
A little time.

00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:21,780
- Yeah.

Beautiful.

Moving on.

Okay, Jean Marie.

00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:32,447

the strike coming up?

00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:33,957
- No.
- No?

11
00:01:33,992 --> 00:01:35,619
There's not gonna be
too much work around.

12
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:37,094
- No.

13
00:01:37,129 --> 00:01:39,461
- Be a good time
to have a friend like Jack.

14
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:40,828
- I got it.
- Excuse me.

15

- No, I got it.

17
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:46,963
You going to the bar tonight?
How about a drink?

18
00:01:47,004 --> 00:01:48,562

- Good job, Sam.
- My turn?

22
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:55,011
- Yeah, so we'll just place you
right in here and--

23
00:01:55,046 --> 00:01:56,240
- With all that glass?

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,712
- Well, we'll sweep it out
a little bit,

25
00:01:57,749 --> 00:01:59,114
but that's your deal.

26
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,014
And then you just exit frame,
and that's the shot.

27
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:02,519
- Is this a close-up?

- Sure.

Can we get a drink?

with her, are you?

Good night, baby.

Cover for me?

- You mind if I join you?

- I don't care.

76
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:03,254
- You handled yourself
pretty good in there.

77
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,225
- Probably right out of a job.

78
00:05:07,697 --> 00:05:09,823
- I handle female fighters,
and I'd like to talk to you.

79

- [laughs]

80
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,533
- I think you got something.

81
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:15,970
I can see it in your eyes.

82
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:19,497
- That's a lame pickup line.

83
00:05:19,542 --> 00:05:21,168
What color are my eyes?

84
00:05:21,209 --> 00:05:22,767
- Blue...

85
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,006
with a little touch
of hazel.

86
00:05:25,047 --> 00:05:26,878
- You seem
like a really nice guy.

87
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,576
I'm just not interested.

88
00:05:28,617 --> 00:05:30,881
- Okay.

89
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:33,945
There's a lot of money
to be made,

90
00:05:33,989 --> 00:05:35,456
if you're interested.

91
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,896
- Hey, you want to come in
for a drink?

92
00:05:53,407 --> 00:05:57,844
- I used to manage
Sonya Sorenson, Tucker Ramirez.

93
00:05:57,878 --> 00:05:59,846
I've been in this business
for years.

94
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,972
It used to be
just entertainment.

95
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,176
Now with this phenomenon
of female fighting,

96
00:06:04,217 --> 00:06:05,343
it's gotten really compet--

97
00:06:05,385 --> 00:06:07,047
- Can you
just cut to the chase?

98
00:06:09,756 --> 00:06:11,725
- You see, there are
these special fights

99
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,659
in private
high-class locations.

100
00:06:14,694 --> 00:06:15,854
- How much?

101
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:18,489
- $500 to $1,000
for the prefights.

102
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:20,123
- How many?

103
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,133
- One, two, sometimes three.

104
00:06:23,302 --> 00:06:25,328
Not much time in between.

105
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:27,431
There are only three rounds.

106
00:06:27,474 --> 00:06:29,533
- What's the catch?

107
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:31,236
- None.

108
00:06:34,314 --> 00:06:36,440
See, there are whole circuits
all around the country--

109
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,450
different cities,
different places,

110
00:06:38,484 --> 00:06:41,612
really affluent people.

111
00:06:41,654 --> 00:06:42,643
Major money.

112
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,025
Look, you think about it.

- How many fighters
do you manage now?

118
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,310
- I'm rebuilding.

- Hey,
what can I do for you?

126
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,644
- I'm hear to see Refugio.

127
00:07:46,683 --> 00:07:48,479
- And I don't remember seeing
your name on the list.

128
00:07:48,517 --> 00:07:53,819
- Um, why don't you just tell
Lilly that I'm here, okay?

129
00:07:53,856 --> 00:07:56,882
Look at the girl I brought.

130
00:07:56,926 --> 00:07:58,290
- You're okay.

131
00:07:58,326 --> 00:07:59,315
- Thank you.

132
00:08:03,265 --> 00:08:04,289
- [laughing]

133
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:07,199
- Come here, sweetheart.

134
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:10,033
- If I win, does that mean
I get to be on top?

135
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:11,471
[both laugh]

136
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:55,739
- Otra vez, otra vez, Refugio.

137
00:08:55,782 --> 00:08:58,250
- Take a breather, hon.
Take a breather.

138
00:08:58,284 --> 00:08:59,945
Aw, Sonny.

139
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:01,954
- How you doing, big boy?
How are you?

140
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:03,114
- How did you get in here?

141
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:05,556
- I crawled in between
a couple of rocks.

142
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:10,756
Listen, I got someone
I'd like you to look at.

143
00:09:10,797 --> 00:09:12,991
- Card's full, man.
I got no more room.

144
00:09:13,031 --> 00:09:14,590
Maybe at the end of the day.
You know what?

145
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:16,396
- No, no, this one, okay?

146

Hey, don't forget
how you got this job.

that one. Come on.

- Yeah.
It's either now or never.

173
00:10:20,029 --> 00:10:21,018
Come on. Come on.

You got your jab.
You got your cross.

184
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,318
Hook, hook.

185
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,911
Uppercut, uppercut.

186
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:47,512
Start off with just a jab.

187
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:50,680
Jab, cross.

188
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,888
Jab, cross.

189
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:54,952
Jab, cross, hook, hook.

190
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:57,157
Jab, cross, hook, hook.

191
00:10:58,734 --> 00:10:59,700
Nice.

192
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:02,532
Give me a combo,
whatever you can.

193
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,901
Hey.

194
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,930
Okay, uh--

195
00:11:07,975 --> 00:11:09,101
- What do you think?

196
00:11:09,142 --> 00:11:10,770
- Where did you find her?

197
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:13,211
- She was working at a bar.

198
00:11:13,247 --> 00:11:14,680
- Okay.

199
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,444
Does she know
what she's getting into?

200
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:17,746
Did you tell her?

201
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:19,150
- Kind of.

202
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:20,846
- [laughs]

203
00:11:20,887 --> 00:11:22,878
You always say that too.

204
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:25,687
- Who really cares as long
as she gets me to The Show?

205
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:27,159
- Okay.

206
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:29,184
- Where's your sister?

207
00:11:29,229 --> 00:11:31,163
- Leave that one out of here,
and I'll help her out.

208
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:32,357
Let's see.

209
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,799
- Sonny?
- All right, Miss Martinez.

210
00:11:34,834 --> 00:11:36,995
- Sonny, where are you?

211
00:11:37,037 --> 00:11:40,473
Where have you been?

212
00:11:40,507 --> 00:11:41,838
How do I look?

213
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:45,174
- Oh, Lilly, Lilly.

214
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:46,677
You look exquisite.

215
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:47,679
I need a favor.

216
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:49,010
You see the blonde lady
in there?

217
00:11:49,048 --> 00:11:50,481
I need you to okay her.

218
00:11:54,586 --> 00:11:57,146
- Watch your wrist.
There you go, again.

219
00:11:57,189 --> 00:11:59,180
All right.

220
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:00,384
Good.

221
00:12:00,426 --> 00:12:01,518
- Refugio.

222
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,050
- Nice.

223
00:12:03,095 --> 00:12:04,460
Hold it.
Hang on.

224
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:12,602
Hey, come here.

225
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:14,832
You've just been cleared
for your first fight.

226
00:12:14,872 --> 00:12:15,839
Congratulations.

227
00:12:15,873 --> 00:12:17,500
- You sure I'm ready?

228
00:12:17,542 --> 00:12:19,635
- You're ready enough
for the girl you'll be fighting.

229
00:12:19,677 --> 00:12:21,269
This is a test of will,
not talent.

230
00:12:21,312 --> 00:12:23,439
Good luck.

231
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:25,540
Refugio.

232
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,914
- Samantha.

233
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,885
- Good luck.
Have a good one.

234
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:31,719
Okay, next girl.

235
00:12:31,755 --> 00:12:33,120
- Nasha, we got Nasha.

236
00:12:33,156 --> 00:12:34,589
- Hello.
- Hi.

237
00:12:34,624 --> 00:12:35,613
- Delighted.

238
00:12:35,659 --> 00:12:36,887
- What about me?

239
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:37,894
- Back to your place.

240
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,122
- [yelling in Russian]

241
00:12:39,162 --> 00:12:41,130
- Niña necia.
Cállate ya!

242
00:12:41,164 --> 00:12:42,222
- [yelling in Russian]

243
00:12:42,265 --> 00:12:44,426
- Okay. Póngase rápido. Vamos.
We can do it.

244
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:46,458
- I don't think any of these
girls are in your league.

245
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:47,993
You got nothing
to worry about, baby.

246
00:12:48,038 --> 00:12:49,596
- I'm not worried.

247
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:51,128
- I'm gonna take care
of some business.

248
00:12:51,173 --> 00:12:52,140
I'll talk to you later.

249
00:12:52,174 --> 00:12:53,163
- Okay.

250
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:54,369
Bye.
- I'll see you.

251
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:59,577
- Look, if you don't buy it,
just call it in.

252
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:01,708
All right, this is good.

253
00:13:01,751 --> 00:13:04,219
It's just a prefight,
nothing to worry about much.

254
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:06,118
If you win, the odds will go up.
That's all.

255
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:07,883
- Sonny.

256
00:13:07,922 --> 00:13:08,946
Wow.

257
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,082
You still hanging out
around here?

258
00:13:10,125 --> 00:13:12,822
I thought they had
the place exterminated.

259
00:13:12,862 --> 00:13:14,261
Hello, darling.

260
00:13:14,296 --> 00:13:16,991
It's my pleasure.

261
00:13:17,032 --> 00:13:18,556
- Why don't you take a hike,
Nedish?

262
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,863
- Why don't you show
some manners

263
00:13:19,902 --> 00:13:21,892
and introduce me
to this lovely lady, please?

264
00:13:21,936 --> 00:13:23,665
- Sam, this is Nedish.

265
00:13:23,705 --> 00:13:24,831
Nedish, this is Sam.

266
00:13:24,873 --> 00:13:27,398
Just another fight promoter.

267
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:29,603
- Not just another
fight promoter

268
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:30,804
but the best, actually.

269
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:32,244
At your service.

270
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,146
- I'm Samantha.

271
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,912
- Sam, we have to go.

272
00:13:38,219 --> 00:13:39,708
Nice to see you.

273
00:13:39,753 --> 00:13:40,742
- You too, Sonny.

274
00:13:40,788 --> 00:13:42,620
- Die.

275
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:44,784
- I'll see you soon, Sam.

276
00:13:44,826 --> 00:13:46,690
- How do you know that guy?

277
00:13:46,727 --> 00:13:48,251
- He's a very dangerous man,
Nedish.

278
00:13:48,296 --> 00:13:50,092
Long story.

279
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,826
[engine rumbling]

280
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:41,345
Where have you been?

281
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,971
You're late.

282
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:44,072
- Do you have a car?

283
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:45,606
- It's another long story.
Come on.

284
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:10,974
- Come on, baby.

285
00:15:11,008 --> 00:15:12,635
Stay in the fight.

286
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:15,440
- [grunting]

287
00:15:21,784 --> 00:15:23,115
- She's out.

288
00:15:23,153 --> 00:15:24,780
- Who's your daddy now?

289
00:15:27,090 --> 00:15:28,580
Whoo!

290
00:15:39,568 --> 00:15:41,434
- You're next.

291
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:49,409
All right, no biting,
no poking in the eyes.

292
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:51,036
Back to your corners.

293
00:15:52,581 --> 00:15:55,516
- [screaming]

294
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,112
- Come on, ref, separate them.

295
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:11,227
Come on, baby, take them back.

296
00:16:11,265 --> 00:16:12,254
Take--take them back.

297
00:16:14,969 --> 00:16:16,027
- Roll her over.

298
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:18,129
Roll her over.

299
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,161
Choke her.

300
00:16:21,976 --> 00:16:23,307
- Put your hooks in.
Put your hooks in.

301
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:41,019
- That's pretty good, girlie.

302
00:16:47,867 --> 00:16:49,390
Looks like you got a star.

303
00:16:57,409 --> 00:17:02,176
9, 10, 11, 12.

304
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,647
Let's pack it up, babe.

305
00:17:09,955 --> 00:17:10,943
- Hey.

306
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,322
How do you feel?

307
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:16,691
- Felt okay.

308
00:17:16,728 --> 00:17:18,958
Are all these fights
so wild and unpredictable?

309
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,626
- Well, this was
a little sloppy, disorganized.

310
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,101
Ref was useless.

311
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:27,730
But just look at it
like a test.

312
00:17:27,772 --> 00:17:29,831
They get a lot harder

313
00:17:29,874 --> 00:17:31,865
when the fighters
are more experienced.

314
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,509
It's not a bad day.

315
00:17:44,888 --> 00:17:46,720
- I just made 1,200 bucks?

316
00:17:46,758 --> 00:17:48,384
- Yeah.

317
00:17:50,627 --> 00:17:52,561
Now, go home
and get some rest.

318
00:17:52,596 --> 00:17:55,565
Do a little run
in the morning.

319
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,591
Here's the address
for tomorrow.

320
00:18:00,404 --> 00:18:03,464
If we win, we go on.

321
00:18:03,507 --> 00:18:04,701
If we lose...

322
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:10,408
You still up for it?

323
00:18:10,447 --> 00:18:11,845
- Yeah.

324
00:18:11,881 --> 00:18:13,371
- Good.

325
00:18:15,718 --> 00:18:16,707
See you.

326
00:18:25,527 --> 00:18:27,428
- Sam, is that you?

327
00:18:27,463 --> 00:18:30,158
Hi, honey.

328
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:31,187
- Hey, Ma.

329
00:18:37,572 --> 00:18:39,631
I made a lot of money tonight.

330
00:18:39,674 --> 00:18:41,437
- Oh, really?
Great.

331
00:18:46,581 --> 00:18:49,572
That bar must be jumping, huh?

332
00:18:49,617 --> 00:18:50,640
- Yeah.

333
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,250
I'm gonna grab some sleep.
I'm really tired.

334
00:18:57,291 --> 00:18:58,280
Good night.

335
00:19:00,027 --> 00:19:02,928
- Hey, how's that new girl
working out?

336
00:19:02,963 --> 00:19:04,362
- Oh, she's...

337
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:09,632
A lot of fun.
She's great.

338
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:10,727
- Good.
- Good night.

339
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,466
- Night, honey.
Sweet dreams.

340
00:19:24,951 --> 00:19:26,111
- [grunts]

341
00:19:29,021 --> 00:19:30,784
- She's out.

342
00:19:40,031 --> 00:19:42,431
[no audible dialogue]

343
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:50,171
- Not a bad day
at the office.

344
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,641
- I can't believe that call.

345
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:54,372
- Good job, baby.

346
00:19:57,716 --> 00:19:58,944
- Nedish wants to see you.

347
00:20:11,463 --> 00:20:13,521
- Sure, I'll see you then.

348
00:20:13,564 --> 00:20:16,294
You know what's gonna happen
if you're late, right?

349
00:20:17,501 --> 00:20:18,524
Thank you.

350
00:20:19,904 --> 00:20:21,394
Thanks. Bye-bye.

351
00:20:24,675 --> 00:20:25,641
Mm.

352
00:20:25,676 --> 00:20:27,041
Hey, baby.

353
00:20:27,077 --> 00:20:28,873
Hello, Sam.
How are you?

354
00:20:28,912 --> 00:20:30,106
It's nice to see you.
- Hi.

355
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:31,876
- Please take a seat.

356
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,473
Do you mind giving us
a few minutes, baby,

357
00:20:33,516 --> 00:20:34,915
waiting in the car?

358
00:20:34,951 --> 00:20:36,680
- Excuse me?

359
00:20:36,719 --> 00:20:39,586
- Do you mind giving us
a couple minutes, please, Mona?

360
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:40,884
Wait in the car, please,

361
00:20:40,924 --> 00:20:43,256
and I'll talk to you
in a minute or two, okay?

362
00:20:46,396 --> 00:20:47,385
Please.

363
00:20:48,731 --> 00:20:49,698
[chuckles]

364
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:50,699
It's okay.

365
00:20:50,733 --> 00:20:52,700
I'll see you in a minute.

366
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,826
It's okay.

367
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:55,394
I'll see you
in a minute, Mona.

368
00:20:55,438 --> 00:20:56,927
Please, Sam.

369
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:02,977
Nice fight.

370
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,807
You were really, really good.

371
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:05,814
- Thanks.

372
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,782
- My pleasure.

373
00:21:07,816 --> 00:21:10,080
Well, this may be
a little premature,

374
00:21:10,118 --> 00:21:12,177
but I think you need
a new manager.

375
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:14,017
- You think so?

376
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:16,523
- Come on, Sam.

377
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:18,855
He's an old-time manager.
He's over the hill.

378
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,884
He will never, ever
get you into The Show,

379
00:21:20,928 --> 00:21:21,986
where the real money is,

380
00:21:22,029 --> 00:21:23,895
so yes, I think so.

381
00:21:26,235 --> 00:21:29,135
I know you need the money.
Okay? I know that.

382
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:30,660
There isn't a girl
who gets in that ring

383
00:21:30,705 --> 00:21:32,035
that doesn't need the money.

384
00:21:32,072 --> 00:21:34,667
So just do me a favor
and think about it.

385
00:21:34,709 --> 00:21:36,437
It's life-changing.

386
00:21:36,476 --> 00:21:39,036
Okay?

387
00:21:39,079 --> 00:21:43,709
Besides, I'm the one who
runs things around here, okay?

388
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,447
These opportunities will come,
and they will go.

389
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:48,579
- Hey! Hey!

390
00:21:48,622 --> 00:21:50,852
Hey, Nedish.

391
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:53,257
Look, I'll decide
if she's ready or not.

392
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:55,420
- I think the lady can make
that decision for herself.

393
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:57,430
And right about now,
I believe I'm her best bet.

394
00:21:57,464 --> 00:21:58,988
- No, thanks.

395
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:00,259
Come on, Sam.

396
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:02,291
- Wait a second.

397
00:22:02,335 --> 00:22:03,302
The Show?

398
00:22:03,336 --> 00:22:04,734
- That's right.

399
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:05,896
- We're not interested.

400
00:22:05,938 --> 00:22:07,132
- I can speak for myself.

401
00:22:07,172 --> 00:22:08,902
- Well, here you go, Sam.

402
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:10,408
Give me a call.

403
00:22:10,442 --> 00:22:11,500
I'd like to hear from you.

404
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:12,602
Listen to me, cowboy.

405
00:22:12,645 --> 00:22:14,704
I think it's time you went
and got yourself a new suit.

406
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:16,112
Okay?

407
00:22:16,148 --> 00:22:17,171
I'll see you.

408
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:27,750
- Here.

409
00:22:31,564 --> 00:22:33,828
- $500? That's it?

410
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:35,856
Tell me about The Show.

411
00:22:37,436 --> 00:22:38,697
- The Show?

412
00:22:38,736 --> 00:22:40,896
You want to know
about The Show?

413
00:22:40,939 --> 00:22:43,464
Do you understand what you're
getting yourself into?

414
00:22:43,508 --> 00:22:45,475
This is a classic move.

415
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,205
This is what he does.

416
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:48,939
Okay? He uses people.

417
00:22:48,979 --> 00:22:51,277
He takes
inexperienced fighters

418
00:22:51,315 --> 00:22:52,977
to assure his fighters
a place in The Show.

419
00:22:53,017 --> 00:22:54,711
- She still would have
to beat me, though,

420
00:22:54,751 --> 00:22:55,877
for a lot more money,

421
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,717
more money
than what you could get me.

422
00:22:57,755 --> 00:22:59,950
- He got to you.
I knew it.

423
00:22:59,991 --> 00:23:01,048
I could smell it.

424
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:02,217
Look, Sam,

425
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:05,716
I am trying to build you
into a fighter, okay?

426
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,855
The fightings up till now
have been easy.

427
00:23:07,898 --> 00:23:10,696
But come on.

428
00:23:10,734 --> 00:23:13,066
I know you have some talent,
but Nedish?

429
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,536
- Have you ever even been
to The Show?

430
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:15,901
- You know what Nedish does?

431
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:17,964
Nedish creates wedges.

432
00:23:18,008 --> 00:23:19,338
He fixes fights.

433
00:23:19,375 --> 00:23:20,808
He does that for a living.

434
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:21,901
- Hey, Sonny.

435
00:23:23,446 --> 00:23:24,606
- I'm sorry, man.

436
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:25,875
I'm sorry.

437
00:23:25,915 --> 00:23:28,543
- Is everything all right?

438
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:30,051
- Yeah.

439
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:37,154
I've seen he and his brother
do it, okay?

440
00:23:37,193 --> 00:23:38,251
And I don't trust him.

441
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:42,289
So just be patient.

442
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:44,629
- I need the money.

443
00:23:48,571 --> 00:23:50,401
- We all need the money.

444
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,812
- Hey, baby, what's your name?

445
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,579
- Samantha Rogers.

446
00:24:39,619 --> 00:24:41,086
- Yeah, you're here.

447
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,213
Are you sure you're ready
for this?

448
00:24:43,256 --> 00:24:44,621
Okay, why don't you pull
that car up

449
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:46,750
right over here for a minute?

450
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,633
- Hey, guarrita.

451
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,509
I heard you been using my name.

452
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:12,039
Yo soy Cynthia Martinez.

453
00:25:18,589 --> 00:25:19,578
[buzzer buzzes]

454
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:32,294
- That's right, that's right.

455
00:25:32,336 --> 00:25:33,802
We got a fight,
ladies and gentlemen.

456
00:25:33,837 --> 00:25:36,500
In our tropical section is,
all the way from Cabrini-Green,

457
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:39,100
that's right, the C to the G
and the B to the B,

458
00:25:39,143 --> 00:25:41,201
the one and only Boom Boom,

459
00:25:41,245 --> 00:25:44,509
and all the way from Singapore,
the one and only Red Dragon.

460
00:25:44,547 --> 00:25:45,514
[bell dings]

461
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:48,540
[people cheering]

462
00:25:53,156 --> 00:25:56,386
- [grunting]

463
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:57,415
- Boom Boom!

464
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:06,433
- Oh, and down goes
the Red Dragon!

465
00:26:08,837 --> 00:26:10,498
Yes, ladies and gentlemen,
oh, my God.

466
00:26:10,539 --> 00:26:11,506
- She's out.

467
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,201
- You know who she is.

468
00:26:13,242 --> 00:26:15,642
- She ain't getting up.
She ain't getting up.

469
00:26:15,677 --> 00:26:17,042
- Boom Boom.

470
00:26:17,079 --> 00:26:18,239
- Ladies and gentlemen.

471
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,440
- Boom Boom.

472
00:26:19,481 --> 00:26:21,380
- Ladies and gentlemen,
she's undefeated,

473
00:26:21,415 --> 00:26:25,250
the one and only B to the B,
Boom Boom.

474
00:26:26,187 --> 00:26:28,816
Now, I want to thank everybody
for coming out tonight.

475
00:26:28,857 --> 00:26:30,085
You ain't got to go home,

476
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,558
but y'all got to get
the time out of here.

477
00:26:32,593 --> 00:26:34,185
We'll see y'all next week.

478
00:26:34,228 --> 00:26:36,025
Thank you for coming, dog.

479
00:26:36,063 --> 00:26:37,394
Hope you all enjoyed
everything tonight.

480
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,899
- Thanks for clearing
the jungle, G.

481
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:51,737
[woman grunting]

482
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:53,736
- You ready?

483
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:09,486
- Hey, baby, how you feeling?
You good?

484
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:10,496
- Mm-hmm.

485
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,554
- Okay, go warm up.

486
00:27:12,866 --> 00:27:13,890
Hey, Tony, how you doing?

487
00:27:13,934 --> 00:27:15,491
- Hey, Eddie.
- Good to see you.

488
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:16,831
You look wonderful.
Take a seat.

489
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,861
Please take a seat.

490
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:21,202
Okay, it's all been
taken care of.

491
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,334
I just want you to know
that we can't lose, okay?

492
00:27:24,376 --> 00:27:26,708
- Mr. Loften's got
a lot riding on this.

493
00:27:26,745 --> 00:27:28,178
- Yeah, I'm sure he does.

494
00:27:28,214 --> 00:27:30,340
- He's eager to fill
that final spot.

495
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:31,348
- Aren't we all, Tony?

496
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:32,850
Please remember
that I only deal

497
00:27:32,885 --> 00:27:34,443
with cream-of-the-crop
girls here.

498
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,453
And you will be paid.

499
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,454
You'll be paid in full.

500
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:37,454
You want to know why?

501
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,751
Because I built this up, okay?

502
00:27:38,791 --> 00:27:40,519
I built all of this up.

503
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,391
Besides, Sonny's girl has yet
to face any real competition.

504
00:27:43,429 --> 00:27:46,261
I put my life on it.

505
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,424
- We're gonna hold you
to that, Eddie.

506
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:49,433
- Okay.

507
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:50,832
Enjoy that tequila, okay?

508
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,859
It costs a little more
than the suit you're wearing.

509
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,337
Please, relax.

510
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:55,930
I'll see you later, Tony.

511
00:28:06,717 --> 00:28:08,184
Nice.

512
00:28:08,218 --> 00:28:10,652
There you go, baby.

513
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:13,045
Nice.

514
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,352
Nice.

515
00:28:15,626 --> 00:28:17,287
[bell dings]

516
00:28:31,641 --> 00:28:32,630
[metallic rattling]

517
00:28:46,154 --> 00:28:47,121
- Hey.

518
00:28:47,155 --> 00:28:48,486
- Hey. Hey!

519
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:49,649
What are you, crazy?

520
00:28:49,691 --> 00:28:50,680
Stay down.

521
00:28:52,127 --> 00:28:55,119
[both grunting]

522
00:29:10,045 --> 00:29:12,274
- Please, let's do it, baby.
Come on.

523
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:15,209
- Get out of that ring.

524
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,807
- It's not your night.

525
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:19,375
- This is no fight, TC.

526
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:23,453
If she hits you, stay down.

527
00:29:28,195 --> 00:29:29,594
She's gonna kill you!

528
00:29:55,722 --> 00:29:57,815
All right, all right!

529
00:29:57,857 --> 00:29:59,017
All right!

530
00:30:04,029 --> 00:30:06,224
All right, all right,
it's enough!

531
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:30,978
- [chuckling]

532
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:33,415
- One step at a time.

533
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,957
- [coughs]

534
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:50,230
- It's Sam, isn't it?

535
00:30:50,273 --> 00:30:51,263
- Yeah, doc.

536
00:30:57,047 --> 00:30:58,639
- Hi, Sam,
my name is Dr. Faber.

537
00:30:58,681 --> 00:31:01,343
I'm gonna take a look at you,
if that's okay.

538
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,411
Can you stand up for me?

539
00:31:07,123 --> 00:31:08,852
How's the ribs?

540
00:31:08,892 --> 00:31:11,087
Yeah, let me check those ribs.

541
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:14,853
All right, sit back down, Sam.

542
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,363
That's it. Slow.

543
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,995
I need you to follow my finger.

544
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:24,300
Okay?

545
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:25,533
Don't move your head.

546
00:31:28,743 --> 00:31:30,177
And back.

547
00:31:31,346 --> 00:31:33,814
Sorry, it's bright.
I know.

548
00:31:33,849 --> 00:31:36,317
I can't believe you let her
go in there like that.

549
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:38,910
What are you thinking?

550
00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:40,649
- I wasn't thinking clearly.

551
00:31:40,689 --> 00:31:41,814
- Obviously.

552
00:31:44,725 --> 00:31:45,885
Get some rest.

553
00:31:56,137 --> 00:31:58,070
- I'm going home, Sonny.

554
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:09,438
[engine rumbling]

555
00:32:39,345 --> 00:32:41,643
- Oh, hi, honey.

556
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,079
I got some leftovers for you.

557
00:32:43,115 --> 00:32:44,343
I'll go heat them up.

558
00:32:44,382 --> 00:32:45,372
- That'd be great.

559
00:32:47,952 --> 00:32:51,855
- Mila and I went
to the supermarket today.

560
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:54,984
She was signing,
and this lady came over to me.

561
00:32:55,026 --> 00:32:56,118
She said to me,

562
00:32:56,161 --> 00:32:57,891
"Oh, that girl
is so beautiful,"

563
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,419
and Mila just lit up.

564
00:32:59,464 --> 00:33:01,523
You should have seen her.
She just lit up.

565
00:33:01,566 --> 00:33:02,555
Here it is.

566
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,700
Samantha?

567
00:33:18,082 --> 00:33:21,073
[phone ringing]

568
00:33:23,487 --> 00:33:24,886
Hello.

569
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:26,253
Who is this?

570
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:30,089
Sonny Cool?

571
00:33:33,497 --> 00:33:34,930
She's not here.

572
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:45,338
Samantha.

573
00:33:45,375 --> 00:33:47,865
What is going on?

574
00:33:52,314 --> 00:33:53,839
- [sighs]

575
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:58,950
- What's going on, Sam?

576
00:34:00,056 --> 00:34:02,888
- Ma, I've been
in these tournaments.

577
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:04,687
I've been making
really good money.

578
00:34:04,726 --> 00:34:08,127
- What do you mean,
tournaments?

579
00:34:08,163 --> 00:34:09,630
- Fighting tournaments.

580
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:12,932
- You've been lying to us.

581
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:14,993
- I had a chance,
and I took it.

582
00:34:15,036 --> 00:34:17,698
- How are you gonna help Mila
if Mila loses you?

583
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,799
- I'm the only chance she has.
I'm all alone.

584
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:22,366
- How dare you say that to me?

585
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,640
You're all alone?

586
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:26,772
I have been here helping you
every bit of the way.

587
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:28,645
Both of you.

588
00:34:28,682 --> 00:34:31,810
Don't you dare give me that bit
about you're alone.

589
00:34:31,852 --> 00:34:33,012
I love you
and I love her

590
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,953
more than anything
in the whole world.

591
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,650
- You know what, Ma?
Don't worry about it.

592
00:34:36,690 --> 00:34:37,679
It's all over.

593
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:39,352
- Do whatever you have
to do, Samantha.

594
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:42,726
But don't you ever say to me
again that you're alone.

595
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:49,057
[water trickling]

596
00:35:12,258 --> 00:35:14,157
- Shot of vodka.

597
00:35:14,193 --> 00:35:17,856
- ¶ Harder than I've ever
been hit ¶

598
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:21,333
¶ Recognizing I wasn't
gonna live forever ¶

599
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:24,096
¶ Reality slowly sank in ¶

600
00:35:24,136 --> 00:35:27,594
¶ I've always got my eyes
on the future ¶

601
00:35:27,639 --> 00:35:31,040
¶ All the time
I've been wasting ¶

602
00:35:31,076 --> 00:35:34,203
¶ Making all
my great big plans ¶

603
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:38,579
¶ Never living
in the moment ¶

604
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:42,484
¶ But I can be here today,
gone tomorrow ¶

605
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,680
- Are you hungry?

606
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:44,688
- No, thanks.

607
00:35:44,722 --> 00:35:45,848
I'll grab something at work.

608
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,653
- Here's your coffee.

609
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,125
Have a nice night.

610
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:52,357
- ¶ It's nothing
but a wish anyway ¶

611
00:35:52,396 --> 00:35:54,921
¶ It's not too late ¶

612
00:35:54,965 --> 00:35:57,762
¶ To steal the day ¶

613
00:35:57,801 --> 00:36:01,738
¶ Oh, it's not too late ¶

614
00:36:01,772 --> 00:36:04,138
¶ I got today ¶

615
00:36:04,175 --> 00:36:06,142
¶ Today I'm gonna run ¶

616
00:36:06,176 --> 00:36:08,736
¶ Until I reach
the far horizon ¶

617
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:12,111
¶ Jump right off
into the deep end ¶

618
00:36:12,148 --> 00:36:16,141
¶ Take a trip
to that unknown destination ¶

619
00:36:16,186 --> 00:36:18,347
¶ Stick all my toes
in the sand ¶

620
00:36:18,388 --> 00:36:20,618
¶ For once I'm finally
gonna live... ¶

621
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:25,285
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Hi, Ma.

622
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:27,693
- You need to go
wash your hands, Mila.

623
00:36:27,731 --> 00:36:29,255
Your dinner's getting cold.

624
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:31,522
Go ahead.

625
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:35,069
And then I read in the paper

626
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,504
there's gonna be
a big motion picture strike.

627
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,666
I don't understand it.

628
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:42,972
Well, what did
Mr. Santana say?

629
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:44,444
- What they all say,

630
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,812
"We can't accommodate
your child's special needs."

631
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:49,374
It's just an excuse
not to spend the time and money.

632
00:36:55,556 --> 00:37:00,493
- You know,
I've been thinking, honey,

633
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:02,325
that maybe it wouldn't
be such a bad idea if we--

634
00:37:02,363 --> 00:37:03,352
- Ma.

635
00:37:12,173 --> 00:37:13,833
I'm gonna put her to bed.

636
00:38:02,988 --> 00:38:04,818
- It was his favorite jacket,
you know.

637
00:38:08,092 --> 00:38:10,458
I don't think he let
another girl wear it but you.

638
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:13,396
[laughs]

639
00:38:14,732 --> 00:38:18,725
You know, I always meant
to give it to you.

640
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:22,569
Don't know why
it took so much time.

641
00:38:22,606 --> 00:38:23,595
Here.

642
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:29,134
- Thanks.

643
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:35,241
- She's a lot like him, Sam.

644
00:38:38,455 --> 00:38:40,445
I just wish that he was here
to see her.

645
00:38:42,626 --> 00:38:43,615
[sighs]

646
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:48,423
He loved you so much.

647
00:38:48,464 --> 00:38:49,761
You know that, don't you?

648
00:38:51,335 --> 00:38:53,097
- I know.

649
00:38:59,542 --> 00:39:01,271
- We got lucky with you.

650
00:39:23,098 --> 00:39:24,588
- Don't go anyplace.

651
00:39:24,633 --> 00:39:25,621
Stay.

652
00:39:29,471 --> 00:39:32,735
[knocking]

653
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:34,934
Hey, hey, hey!

654
00:39:34,975 --> 00:39:35,964
Hey!

655
00:40:07,073 --> 00:40:08,541
- Sonny.

656
00:40:26,392 --> 00:40:28,120
How did you find me?

657
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,627
- Carrie at the bar.

658
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,494
Is this your daughter?

659
00:40:32,531 --> 00:40:34,055
- This is Mila,

660
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,660
and this is Ruth,
Mila's teacher.

661
00:40:40,739 --> 00:40:41,706
- She's beautiful.

662
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,707
Hello, Mila.

663
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,437
I'm Sonny.

664
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,608
Hello.

665
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,047
- Mm.

666
00:41:12,035 --> 00:41:13,799
- How long has she been--

667
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,498
- It's a rare case.

668
00:41:15,538 --> 00:41:17,768
Mila was born
with a neurological abnormality.

669
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:19,104
She's deaf as well.

670
00:41:19,142 --> 00:41:20,268
Her balance is affected.

671
00:41:20,310 --> 00:41:21,436
It's complicated.

672
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:23,776
What's on your mind?

673
00:41:23,813 --> 00:41:26,680
- Well,
I just came here to talk.

674
00:41:26,716 --> 00:41:29,810
I just don't think
it's a convenient time.

675
00:41:29,853 --> 00:41:32,720
I'll call you.

676
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:33,744
Bye.

677
00:41:43,032 --> 00:41:45,057
- We're talking.

678
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,325
- Okay.

679
00:41:47,369 --> 00:41:50,337
Look, I don't have much time,
so here's the deal.

680
00:41:50,371 --> 00:41:51,805
One of the fighters
who qualified

681
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,173
suffered from a concussion,
a sparring accident.

682
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:56,871
I did a little
wheeling and dealing

683
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:58,812
with Lilly and Refugio,

684
00:41:58,847 --> 00:42:00,438
and I got you in
as the wild card,

685
00:42:00,481 --> 00:42:02,313
her replacement.

686
00:42:02,351 --> 00:42:04,751
We've got just under
two weeks to prepare

687
00:42:04,787 --> 00:42:07,414
for the biggest
winner-take-all event:

688
00:42:07,455 --> 00:42:09,616
The Show.

689
00:42:09,657 --> 00:42:11,147
- I don't know, Sonny.

690
00:42:11,192 --> 00:42:13,524
I've got responsibilities.

691
00:42:19,833 --> 00:42:22,063
- This was a bad idea.

692
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:23,934
I shouldn't have come here.

693
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:29,103
I'll see you around.

694
00:42:31,278 --> 00:42:32,267
- What am I supposed to do?

695
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:34,439
I'm not getting any breaks.

696
00:42:36,683 --> 00:42:38,514
You know I can't win.

697
00:42:38,552 --> 00:42:39,746
Why did you even come?

698
00:42:39,786 --> 00:42:41,777
- She never knocked you down.

699
00:42:46,493 --> 00:42:48,791
- [crying]

700
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:52,959
Why don't you go?

701
00:42:59,872 --> 00:43:01,362
I got beat up.

702
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:02,499
I got--

703
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:08,609
- She never knocked you down.

704
00:43:10,515 --> 00:43:11,483
Come on.

705
00:43:11,517 --> 00:43:12,677
You can win.

706
00:43:16,387 --> 00:43:18,413
Come on.

707
00:43:19,991 --> 00:43:21,151
Say it.

708
00:43:26,231 --> 00:43:27,459
- I can win.

709
00:43:27,498 --> 00:43:29,262
- Sure, you can.

710
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,199
- So what's the game plan?

711
00:43:31,236 --> 00:43:32,533
- How much have you heard?

712
00:43:32,570 --> 00:43:34,162
- Enough.

713
00:43:57,059 --> 00:43:58,458
- All right, get ready.

714
00:43:58,495 --> 00:43:59,518
You want to box?

715
00:43:59,562 --> 00:44:01,496
Come here, come here.
Here you go.

716
00:44:01,531 --> 00:44:03,295
Oh, no.

717
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,493
Oh, no, not everybody.

718
00:44:04,535 --> 00:44:06,399
Oh, no, oh, no,
they're on top of me.

719
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,665
Oh, no. Oh, no.

720
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:10,501
Here, come here.
Oh, no.

721
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:11,632
Okay, all right.

722
00:44:11,674 --> 00:44:12,936
All right,
now, get out of here.

723
00:44:12,975 --> 00:44:13,964
Leave.

724
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:15,944
I got to do some work.
You guys are great.

725
00:44:15,978 --> 00:44:18,208
Leave these behind.
Leave these behind.

726
00:44:18,247 --> 00:44:19,474
Hey, come here.

727
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:21,210
Hey, hey, hey.

728
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:22,216
Come here.

729
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:23,411
All right, you guys,
can come back.

730
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,851
But first,
give me that space, okay?

731
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:26,547
No, we're done.
I got to do some work. Okay?

732
00:44:26,588 --> 00:44:28,250
- Oh.
- Yeah, go over there.

733
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,485
Go inside.

734
00:44:29,525 --> 00:44:30,491
Okay?

735
00:44:30,526 --> 00:44:31,492
Take care.

736
00:44:31,526 --> 00:44:32,584
Superman, give me five.

737
00:44:32,627 --> 00:44:33,616
Okay.

738
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:52,669
[knocking]

739
00:45:15,034 --> 00:45:16,331
- Be patient.

740
00:45:23,676 --> 00:45:24,938
Nice day.

741
00:45:27,046 --> 00:45:28,035
- Was.

742
00:45:36,055 --> 00:45:37,521
- Al, I'd like you
to meet Samantha.

743
00:45:37,556 --> 00:45:39,183
- Sorry, Sonny.

744
00:45:39,224 --> 00:45:41,785
I am not interested.

745
00:45:41,828 --> 00:45:42,954
- Come on, Al.

746
00:45:42,996 --> 00:45:45,657
Can I have a word
with you alone?

747
00:45:45,697 --> 00:45:46,755
Just for a second?

748
00:45:46,798 --> 00:45:48,493
- No.

749
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:50,091
- You want me to come inside?

750
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:51,466
- Yeah, come on in.
Come on in.

751
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:53,903
- It's not a good idea.

752
00:45:56,341 --> 00:45:57,830
Look,
this is different, okay?

753
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,571
This is not--
- I said no!

754
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:07,311
And no means no.

755
00:46:07,351 --> 00:46:11,549
- Look, I loved her
as much as you did, okay?

756
00:46:11,589 --> 00:46:13,989
Danielle was our ticket.

757
00:46:14,025 --> 00:46:17,152
Xavier investigated
every angle on that accident.

758
00:46:17,193 --> 00:46:19,662
There was nothing we could do.
It wasn't our fault.

759
00:46:20,998 --> 00:46:23,989
But this girl can take us back
to The Show.

760
00:46:26,938 --> 00:46:28,098
Give her two minutes.

761
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,105
- The Show?

762
00:46:35,845 --> 00:46:38,871
- The Show.

763
00:46:38,915 --> 00:46:40,678
- Isn't this the girl
that got beat up by Mona?

764
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:43,916
- She never knocked her down.

765
00:46:43,954 --> 00:46:45,511
- She didn't knock you out?

766
00:46:50,727 --> 00:46:53,593
All right.

767
00:46:53,629 --> 00:46:55,393
Let's see what you got.

768
00:46:55,431 --> 00:46:56,728
- Thanks.

769
00:46:58,634 --> 00:47:00,431
- Come on up.

770
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:01,458
Show me what you got.

771
00:47:07,142 --> 00:47:08,199
Pick up the pinkie gloves.

772
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:10,642
That's for the girls.

773
00:47:10,679 --> 00:47:11,667
Yeah.

774
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:14,873
No, oh, I'm sorry.

775
00:47:14,916 --> 00:47:16,281
Yeah, go ahead,
put them on.

776
00:47:16,317 --> 00:47:17,443
Put them on.
Put them on.

777
00:47:17,485 --> 00:47:18,577
This will be good.

778
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:20,086
Whoa.

779
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:21,088
Yeah, I'm sorry.

780
00:47:21,122 --> 00:47:22,146
I'm being a jerk.

781
00:47:22,190 --> 00:47:23,782
Go ahead, go ahead.
Yeah, I'm sorry.

782
00:47:23,825 --> 00:47:25,656
Really, no, no.

783
00:47:25,693 --> 00:47:27,182
Go ahead,
pick them up.

784
00:47:27,227 --> 00:47:30,129
Go ahead, put the gloves on,
all right?

785
00:47:30,164 --> 00:47:31,960
Oh, prepare
to defend yourself.

786
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:32,966
I guess we started.

787
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,764
Oh.

788
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,232
All right, oh, all right.

789
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,570
Whoa, hey, hey.

790
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:44,799
Come on.

791
00:47:46,146 --> 00:47:47,875
Whoa, keep your hands up.

792
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:49,074
Keep your--whoa!

793
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,708
- Teach him, baby.
Teach him.

794
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:52,912
All right, all right, all right,
all right, all right.

795
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,512
Hey, come on.

796
00:47:55,554 --> 00:47:56,543
- Okay.

797
00:47:59,058 --> 00:48:00,549
Good hands.

798
00:48:06,298 --> 00:48:08,163
How much time do we have?

799
00:48:10,503 --> 00:48:11,765
- Just under two weeks.

800
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:13,203
- Oh.

801
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:15,002
Well, at least you got
the entry fee, right?

802
00:48:15,041 --> 00:48:16,837
- That was something
I need to talk to you about.

803
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,503
- Oh, it figures.

804
00:48:18,544 --> 00:48:20,568
We're gonna need an angel.

805
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:24,242
both: Flame.

806
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:32,218
- ¶ Almost over you ¶

807
00:48:32,257 --> 00:48:39,993
¶ The way the sun
gives in to the moon ¶

808
00:48:40,031 --> 00:48:47,630
¶ Almost over you ¶

809
00:48:47,671 --> 00:48:55,578
¶ The way the sun
gives in to the moon ¶

810
00:48:55,612 --> 00:48:59,343
¶ An old wind told me ¶

811
00:48:59,383 --> 00:49:03,216
¶ From the wrong side
of the road ¶

812
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:06,188
¶ Something ¶

813
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:09,483
- What do you want, Al?

814
00:49:09,526 --> 00:49:12,494
- I need you to train
this fighter for The Show.

815
00:49:12,528 --> 00:49:13,620
We got two weeks.

816
00:49:13,663 --> 00:49:15,824
This is Samantha.
Come here, Samantha.

817
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:17,127
She needs some ring tricks.

818
00:49:17,166 --> 00:49:18,133
You got them.

819
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,134
- You're an idiot.

820
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:20,294
What did you do,
promise her

821
00:49:20,336 --> 00:49:21,997
that you could make her
become a champion?

822
00:49:22,038 --> 00:49:23,335
- Hey, hey, hey.

823
00:49:23,372 --> 00:49:25,135
I need some advice
from a champion

824
00:49:25,174 --> 00:49:26,936
to make a champion,
all right?

825
00:49:26,975 --> 00:49:27,943
Are you in?

826
00:49:27,977 --> 00:49:29,170
- That was a long time ago,

827
00:49:29,211 --> 00:49:30,873
and I don't want to go down
that path again,

828
00:49:30,913 --> 00:49:32,346
see some pretty young thing
like this

829
00:49:32,381 --> 00:49:34,041
get her brains bashed in
like Danielle.

830
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:36,312
- Hey, all right, fine, great!
Good-bye.

831
00:49:36,351 --> 00:49:37,409
Thank you very much for coming.

832
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:40,012
- Fine, thank you.
Have a nice life.

833
00:49:40,055 --> 00:49:41,022
Sonny.

834
00:49:41,056 --> 00:49:42,045
I should have known.

835
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:43,216
When you two get together,

836
00:49:43,258 --> 00:49:45,021
you have these
harebrained scheme ideas.

837
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:46,186
- Let her go, Sonny.

838
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:47,525
- It's a good idea.

839
00:49:47,562 --> 00:49:49,359
- It's a good idea?

840
00:49:49,397 --> 00:49:51,524
- She can take us back
to The Show.

841
00:49:51,566 --> 00:49:52,658
- Come on.

842
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,692
For old times' sake.

843
00:49:54,736 --> 00:49:55,862
We need you.

844
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:58,031
Yeah, come on.

845
00:49:58,073 --> 00:50:00,006
Come on.

846
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:01,007
Yeah.

847
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,033
- Oh.
- Come here, baby.

848
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:04,738
Okay?
- Yeah.

849
00:50:07,081 --> 00:50:08,912
- That's my girl.

850
00:50:16,023 --> 00:50:17,422
- Don't tire out on me.
Come on, baby.

851
00:50:17,458 --> 00:50:18,890
There should be
a little more fury.

852
00:50:24,431 --> 00:50:25,455
- Roundhouse.

853
00:50:25,499 --> 00:50:27,193
Nice.

854
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:28,895
[grunting]

855
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:30,300
Again, again.

856
00:50:32,705 --> 00:50:34,570
Push me back.
Push me back.

857
00:50:35,208 --> 00:50:37,768
[grunting]

858
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:40,178
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

859
00:50:40,213 --> 00:50:42,545
Come on, up, up, up,
up, up, up, up, up.

860
00:50:57,462 --> 00:50:58,952
[both grunting]

861
00:51:02,334 --> 00:51:04,666
- [coughs]

862
00:51:04,703 --> 00:51:08,036
- I'm not interested
in champions of the ring.

863
00:51:08,073 --> 00:51:11,439
I'm interested
in champions of the heart.

864
00:51:11,476 --> 00:51:14,410
- Sucker punching me
does not make you a champion.

865
00:51:14,445 --> 00:51:17,039
- No, but that's
the game in here,

866
00:51:17,081 --> 00:51:18,878
and right now,
you'd be done.

867
00:51:18,916 --> 00:51:20,315
There's no rules
in this ring.

868
00:51:20,351 --> 00:51:22,376
You should listen to her.

869
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,853
- There are a lot
of fighters out there

870
00:51:23,888 --> 00:51:26,049
that really, really
want this,

871
00:51:26,090 --> 00:51:27,250
and on the night of the fight,

872
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:28,815
when you're getting
your ass kicked

873
00:51:28,859 --> 00:51:30,986
and you're seeing stars
and maybe angels,

874
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:35,260
I'm gonna ask you
one more time:

875
00:51:35,299 --> 00:51:37,893
just how bad
do you want this?

876
00:51:57,653 --> 00:51:58,779
- Go, baby. Go.

877
00:51:58,821 --> 00:52:01,382
Move back.
Roundhouse kick.

878
00:52:01,424 --> 00:52:03,653
Back. Roundhouse.
Back. Roundhouse.

879
00:52:06,229 --> 00:52:08,560
[no audible dialogue]

880
00:52:14,036 --> 00:52:15,731
- Come on,
that's all it takes.

881
00:52:15,771 --> 00:52:18,604
[engine grinding]

882
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:35,556
How do you feel?

883
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,557
- Okay.

884
00:52:36,591 --> 00:52:37,649
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

885
00:52:37,692 --> 00:52:38,659
How do I look?

886
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:40,888
- You look real good.

887
00:52:40,928 --> 00:52:43,896
[engine grinding]

888
00:52:43,930 --> 00:52:47,058
[engine turns over]

889
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,036
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

890
00:52:52,440 --> 00:52:53,406
- Let's go.

891
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,407
Excellent.

892
00:52:54,441 --> 00:52:56,409
Jab right.
Jab right.

893
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:57,603
High kick.

894
00:52:57,644 --> 00:52:58,941
- Okay, that's good.
That's good.

895
00:52:58,979 --> 00:52:59,946
That's good for today.

896
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,072
How's your hand?

897
00:53:01,114 --> 00:53:02,342
It hurts, right?

898
00:53:02,382 --> 00:53:04,350
Get some ice on that thing,
okay?

899
00:53:04,384 --> 00:53:05,976
You're doing good.

900
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:07,987
Good work. Thanks.

901
00:53:08,021 --> 00:53:09,283
- Thanks, Al.

902
00:53:09,323 --> 00:53:11,085
- Hey, Sonny,
meet you in the car.

903
00:53:11,123 --> 00:53:12,112
I got to go get cleaned up.

904
00:53:12,158 --> 00:53:13,990
- Ten minutes.
- Thanks.

905
00:53:14,027 --> 00:53:17,018
- Sammy, I'm so proud of you.

906
00:53:17,063 --> 00:53:19,361
You know what?
You're doing a great job.

907
00:53:19,398 --> 00:53:20,922
Just, you know,
stay focused,

908
00:53:20,966 --> 00:53:23,696
and, uh,
go get some ice on that.

909
00:53:23,736 --> 00:53:24,703
Okay?
- Okay.

910
00:53:24,737 --> 00:53:25,726
- Good night, sweetie.

911
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,042
- We're all here?

912
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:41,442
Good.

913
00:53:41,486 --> 00:53:42,953
So we begin.

914
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,046
This is the richest pot
so far.

915
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:47,217
$250,000,

916
00:53:47,258 --> 00:53:48,725
winner take all.

917
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:49,954
The winner also gets

918
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:53,952
15% of the total bet
on the final fight.

919
00:53:53,998 --> 00:53:55,727
- Gentlemen.

920
00:53:55,767 --> 00:53:57,598
Oh, my God.

921
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:58,863
I can't believe my eyes.

922
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:01,928
Look who filed
for unemployment.

923
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,702
Nice to see you, Al.

924
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,271
- May I continue, Nedish?

925
00:54:07,311 --> 00:54:09,779
- Sorry, Mr. Loften.
Absolutely.

926
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:12,976
- Anyone who tries to fix
or manipulate any of the fights

927
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,348
will have to answer to me.

928
00:54:15,386 --> 00:54:17,013
His fighter
will be disqualified,

929
00:54:17,054 --> 00:54:18,248
escorted off the ground.

930
00:54:18,288 --> 00:54:20,279
You will not be so lucky.

931
00:54:20,324 --> 00:54:22,485
Any question?

932
00:54:22,526 --> 00:54:24,356
- Well, I suggest
the final contest

933
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:26,295
be an all-out
full-contact fight.

934
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:28,297
Anything goes.

935
00:54:28,331 --> 00:54:30,800
- Well, that's up to you,
everyone here.

936
00:54:32,535 --> 00:54:36,595
- We're in if the winner's share
is increased.

937
00:54:36,638 --> 00:54:38,368
- Sounds good to me.

938
00:54:38,408 --> 00:54:39,965
More money, full-contact.

939
00:54:40,008 --> 00:54:42,499
- El puño limpio.

940
00:54:42,544 --> 00:54:43,636
Apostamos.

941
00:54:43,678 --> 00:54:45,579
- Four years ago.

942
00:54:45,614 --> 00:54:48,310
Have you forgotten?

943
00:54:48,350 --> 00:54:49,978
Is it so long ago?

944
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:51,781
- I believe
that was a fluke, Al.

945
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,048
- A fluke?

946
00:54:53,088 --> 00:54:54,248
She's a vegetable.

947
00:54:54,289 --> 00:54:55,551
- Come on, she's a vegetable?

948
00:54:55,590 --> 00:54:56,989
People become
more than vegetables

949
00:54:57,025 --> 00:54:58,049
in regular sanctioned fights.

950
00:54:58,093 --> 00:54:59,424
- Hey, don't talk to me
about boxing.

951
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:01,895
You've never been
in a ring in your life.

952
00:55:04,132 --> 00:55:06,657
You double-crossed us.

953
00:55:06,701 --> 00:55:08,463
Nobody stepped in to stop it.

954
00:55:08,502 --> 00:55:10,629
She was almost beaten to death.

955
00:55:14,709 --> 00:55:16,232
You know about this?

956
00:55:19,146 --> 00:55:21,114
- No.

957
00:55:21,148 --> 00:55:22,672
- What kind of people
are you?

958
00:55:22,716 --> 00:55:24,114
- It was obvious
she never should have been

959
00:55:24,151 --> 00:55:25,310
in the ring
in the first place.

960
00:55:25,352 --> 00:55:27,183
- You know what?
You shouldn't be in this room.

961
00:55:27,221 --> 00:55:29,121
Who'd you con
to get to this party, buddy?

962
00:55:29,156 --> 00:55:30,986
- The past is the past.

963
00:55:31,024 --> 00:55:39,295
Now, what if I personally add
$250,000 to the pot,

964
00:55:39,332 --> 00:55:41,823
bringing the total
to $1/2 million?

965
00:55:41,868 --> 00:55:44,735
Anyone object now?

966
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:46,705
- I do.

967
00:55:46,739 --> 00:55:49,401
- Then why don't you
pull your fighter, Al?

968
00:55:49,442 --> 00:55:51,204
- Why don't you shut up
and sit down?

969
00:55:51,243 --> 00:55:52,335
I'm out of here.

970
00:55:52,377 --> 00:55:53,345
You coming?

971
00:55:53,379 --> 00:55:54,811
Come on.

972
00:55:54,847 --> 00:55:56,213
Come on, let's go.

973
00:55:56,249 --> 00:55:58,045
We're out. Good-bye.

974
00:55:58,083 --> 00:55:59,847
- Look, uh--
- What?

975
00:55:59,886 --> 00:56:01,375
- Why don't you be reasonable?

976
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:03,081
- Reasonable?

977
00:56:04,524 --> 00:56:05,512
I'm out of here.

978
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:08,083
- Al. Al!

979
00:56:08,126 --> 00:56:09,923
- You know what, Sonny?

980
00:56:09,962 --> 00:56:11,122
Bottom line is,

981
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:12,652
she didn't deserve
to be here anyway.

982
00:56:12,697 --> 00:56:15,063
She should be at home
taking care of her crippled kid,

983
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:17,431
as far as I'm concerned.

984
00:56:17,468 --> 00:56:18,457
- Come on, come on!

985
00:56:18,503 --> 00:56:20,562
Come on!

986
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:22,937
[all shouting]

987
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:24,339
- Pissant!

988
00:56:24,375 --> 00:56:26,206
Let me show you
what bare knuckles is all about.

989
00:56:26,244 --> 00:56:27,370
- Enough!

990
00:56:27,411 --> 00:56:29,709
Settle your personal dispute
elsewhere.

991
00:56:29,747 --> 00:56:31,681
You.

992
00:56:31,716 --> 00:56:32,842
Not in my house.

993
00:56:32,884 --> 00:56:34,111
- I'm okay.

994
00:56:34,151 --> 00:56:36,779
- Unless, of course,

995
00:56:36,821 --> 00:56:40,689
you're wearing
a short pink skirt, lipstick,

996
00:56:40,725 --> 00:56:46,163
have the superb
nichons, eh?

997
00:56:46,197 --> 00:56:47,686
Alors, gentlemen,
it is settled.

998
00:56:47,731 --> 00:56:50,860
$1/2 million, 15%.

999
00:56:57,073 --> 00:57:00,200
I must leave you
to my beautiful wife.

1000
00:57:00,243 --> 00:57:01,210
- All right, gentlemen.

1001
00:57:01,243 --> 00:57:03,609
Have a good evening.

1002
00:57:03,646 --> 00:57:05,978
We look forward
to seeing you at The Show.

1003
00:57:06,015 --> 00:57:09,884
And remember,
it is a black-tie event.

1004
00:57:13,155 --> 00:57:15,589
- I got $200 against her.

1005
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:17,114
You gonna take it or not?

1006
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,319
- Look out for my fighter.

1007
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:19,884
- Oh, hey.

1008
00:57:52,225 --> 00:57:53,887
- Hey, Sonny.

1009
00:58:02,736 --> 00:58:06,001
- You ever touch me again,
you ever come at me again,

1010
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,597
and I'm gonna
make your life--

1011
00:58:07,641 --> 00:58:09,506
- Hey! Hey!

1012
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:10,601
Hey!

1013
00:58:13,013 --> 00:58:14,571
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1014
00:58:14,615 --> 00:58:16,980
Excuse me.
We have a problem here?

1015
00:58:17,016 --> 00:58:19,713
- No, no problem.
I think this guy hurt himself.

1016
00:58:19,753 --> 00:58:20,947
- Come on.

1017
00:58:22,322 --> 00:58:23,550
Get up.

1018
00:58:26,092 --> 00:58:28,652
- Get off of me.

1019
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:30,719
- Okay, let's go.

1020
00:58:30,763 --> 00:58:32,253
Come on.

1021
00:58:40,439 --> 00:58:42,703
You okay?

1022
00:58:42,742 --> 00:58:45,232
- No, I'm not okay.

1023
00:58:45,276 --> 00:58:47,676
- Well, you look great.

1024
00:58:47,712 --> 00:58:49,304
Come on.

1025
00:58:49,347 --> 00:58:52,339
[laughing]

1026
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:10,658
- Hey.

1027
00:59:10,701 --> 00:59:12,430
- Hey.

1028
00:59:12,469 --> 00:59:15,496
- Al told me what happened.

1029
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,201
- It's unbelievable.

1030
00:59:18,242 --> 00:59:21,369
It was innocent.
It was fun.

1031
00:59:21,412 --> 00:59:24,210
It was feminine.

1032
00:59:24,248 --> 00:59:27,945
Now it's dirty
and competitive.

1033
00:59:27,985 --> 00:59:30,146
You know, I can get back
most of the entry fee.

1034
00:59:30,187 --> 00:59:32,814
- And do what?

1035
00:59:32,855 --> 00:59:35,153
- Well, now
that it's bare knuckles,

1036
00:59:35,191 --> 00:59:36,385
it's full-contact.

1037
00:59:36,426 --> 00:59:37,893
Anything goes.

1038
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:39,293
- I can see that.

1039
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:40,989
- Are you sure you want to--

1040
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,622
- More than ever.

1041
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,828
- [chuckles]

1042
00:59:50,006 --> 00:59:52,440
- Enough of this, okay?

1043
00:59:52,475 --> 00:59:54,339
We got work to do.
Come on.

1044
00:59:58,714 --> 01:00:00,147
- Thank you.

1045
01:00:01,650 --> 01:00:02,948
- You're welcome.

1046
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:05,420
- Okay, back to biz.

1047
01:00:05,454 --> 01:00:07,922
It's time to discuss
each one of the fighters,

1048
01:00:07,956 --> 01:00:09,980
since they're probably
discussing you right now.

1049
01:00:10,024 --> 01:00:11,083
- How many fighters?

1050
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:12,923
- 16 in all, counting you.

1051
01:00:12,961 --> 01:00:14,986
Means you'll have to win
four fights to win it all.

1052
01:00:15,030 --> 01:00:18,260
- First, from South America,
there's Cindy Martinez--

1053
01:00:18,299 --> 01:00:19,927
the real Cindy Martinez.

1054
01:00:19,968 --> 01:00:21,162
She's a jabber.

1055
01:00:21,203 --> 01:00:23,103
She's also a local favorite.

1056
01:00:23,138 --> 01:00:25,470
- It's rumored that her managers
made deals with the others.

1057
01:00:25,507 --> 01:00:26,667
- Deals?

1058
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:29,335
- Yeah, some of the fighters
will agree to take a dive

1059
01:00:29,376 --> 01:00:30,638
if the money's good enough.

1060
01:00:30,678 --> 01:00:32,441
Raises the odds,
but don't count on the dive.

1061
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,448
- Then there's Kim Sue.

1062
01:00:34,482 --> 01:00:35,881
Kim Sue's real fast.

1063
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:37,314
She's little, she's small,
but bam,

1064
01:00:37,351 --> 01:00:39,012
she can sweep your legs out
right from under you

1065
01:00:39,053 --> 01:00:40,350
and land a blowout punch.

1066
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,853
- Yeah, and she's
a really tricky one.

1067
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,356
That's why you got
to stay on your toes

1068
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,789
when you're fighting her.

1069
01:00:44,825 --> 01:00:46,519
And then there's
Trixie the Trickster.

1070
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:47,787
- Nah.

1071
01:00:47,827 --> 01:00:49,727
- Yeah, you're right.

1072
01:00:49,763 --> 01:00:52,960
- Then we have
our Romanian favorite, Nasha.

1073
01:00:52,999 --> 01:00:54,489
Strong, tall,

1074
01:00:54,534 --> 01:00:56,161
but she's not something
you can't handle.

1075
01:00:56,202 --> 01:00:57,726
- I disagree.
She's a lot to handle.

1076
01:00:57,771 --> 01:00:59,534
She's a world-class swordsman.

1077
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,970
Very unique style.

1078
01:01:01,006 --> 01:01:02,304
And there's Boom Boom.

1079
01:01:02,342 --> 01:01:04,275
Six feet tall, 140.

1080
01:01:04,309 --> 01:01:06,971
She can take a hit,
but she can deliver one.

1081
01:01:07,013 --> 01:01:08,912
She goes for the knockout
with each swing.

1082
01:01:08,947 --> 01:01:10,916
If she connects,
it's over.

1083
01:01:10,950 --> 01:01:12,610
They say she's related
to John Henry.

1084
01:01:12,651 --> 01:01:14,915
- Then there's Mona.

1085
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:18,252
Mona's a well-rounded,
tough fighter.

1086
01:01:18,290 --> 01:01:20,588
I don't think we have
to talk about her.

1087
01:01:20,626 --> 01:01:21,786
- And the others?

1088
01:01:21,827 --> 01:01:24,590
- Each fighter
has their own unique style.

1089
01:01:24,629 --> 01:01:26,257
You do what you do best:

1090
01:01:26,298 --> 01:01:27,925
adapt to each one
of those styles.

1091
01:01:27,965 --> 01:01:30,025
That'll make you a winner.

1092
01:01:30,068 --> 01:01:32,263
- Look, each one of these girls
got their own tricks

1093
01:01:32,304 --> 01:01:33,770
and their own rhythm.

1094
01:01:33,805 --> 01:01:35,932
You bring your rhythm in,
your energy.

1095
01:01:35,973 --> 01:01:37,270
Change it up some.

1096
01:01:37,308 --> 01:01:39,776
Then you go in
for the kill.

1097
01:01:39,811 --> 01:01:42,245
- We've all got
something for you.

1098
01:01:42,280 --> 01:01:43,804
It's from all of us.

1099
01:02:01,666 --> 01:02:04,133
- It's beautiful.

1100
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:10,466
- Oh, Sam.
- Hi, Mrs. Macintyre.

1101
01:02:10,507 --> 01:02:12,737
- Hi, dear.
Come over.

1102
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:16,412
Nice to see you.

1103
01:02:16,446 --> 01:02:18,879
- Nice to see you.

1104
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:21,610
- Sam, do you know

1105
01:02:21,650 --> 01:02:25,882
that I was a young wife,
a young mother,

1106
01:02:25,921 --> 01:02:28,914
and a young war bride?

1107
01:02:28,959 --> 01:02:31,518
Oh, my.

1108
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:33,790
My world turned over.

1109
01:02:33,829 --> 01:02:38,425
You know, we were the--
what did they call us?

1110
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:40,230
The girls that could.

1111
01:02:43,037 --> 01:02:48,999
So no matter what happens,

1112
01:02:49,044 --> 01:02:52,274
you got to carry on.

1113
01:02:52,313 --> 01:02:54,304
- Thanks, Mrs. Macintyre.

1114
01:03:03,925 --> 01:03:06,722
[both arguing in Russian]

1115
01:03:12,466 --> 01:03:14,764
- Girls this way,
guys that way.

1116
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:18,032
[both continue arguing
in Russian]

1117
01:03:18,071 --> 01:03:19,038
- Hi.

1118
01:03:19,072 --> 01:03:22,064
Girls this way,
guys that way.

1119
01:03:22,108 --> 01:03:23,542
- Good luck, babe.

1120
01:03:23,577 --> 01:03:25,010
- Thanks.

1121
01:03:25,045 --> 01:03:26,069
- Guys this way.

1122
01:03:26,113 --> 01:03:27,909
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

1123
01:03:27,947 --> 01:03:29,244
Uh, excuse me.

1124
01:03:29,282 --> 01:03:31,012
What did I just say?
Guys that way.

1125
01:03:32,285 --> 01:03:33,752
[applause]

1126
01:03:33,786 --> 01:03:36,346
- Merci. Thank you.

1127
01:03:36,389 --> 01:03:38,584
I am about
to introduce to you

1128
01:03:38,624 --> 01:03:42,287
16 of the meanest,
toughest,

1129
01:03:42,328 --> 01:03:44,762
and, I just might add,
sexiest

1130
01:03:44,797 --> 01:03:46,856
bare-knuckle fighters
from all over the world.

1131
01:03:46,899 --> 01:03:50,527
Let us welcome
our Pussycats.

1132
01:03:50,568 --> 01:03:53,561

1134
01:03:59,312 --> 01:04:01,142
- FF2.

1135
01:04:02,615 --> 01:04:04,981
FF3.

1136
01:04:05,017 --> 01:04:07,109
FF4.

1137
01:04:07,152 --> 01:04:09,177
FF5.

1138
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,745
FF6.

1139
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:13,280
FF7.

1140
01:04:13,325 --> 01:04:14,986
FF8.

1141
01:04:15,026 --> 01:04:18,518
FF9.

1142
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,623
FF10.

1143
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:25,431
FF11.

FF14.

1147
01:04:33,277 --> 01:04:36,734
FF15.

1148
01:04:36,779 --> 01:04:39,908
And finally, FF16.

1149

[applause]

1150
01:04:41,819 --> 01:04:43,752
Fighting will commence
at high noon.

1151
01:04:45,088 --> 01:04:49,718
And may the best fighter
win it all.

1152
01:04:49,759 --> 01:04:51,454
- That's you.

1153
01:04:51,494 --> 01:04:53,121
- [whispering indistinctly]

1154
01:05:19,488 --> 01:05:21,012
- Whoo!

1155
01:05:22,024 --> 01:05:23,651
- Hold on.
This is women only.

1156
01:05:23,692 --> 01:05:24,716
I need you to step out.

1157
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,227
- I'm a manager.

1158
01:05:26,261 --> 01:05:28,024
I guess this
is where I leave you.

1159
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,086
Good luck.

1160
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:30,154
- You got to go.

1161
01:05:30,197 --> 01:05:32,723
- Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

1162
01:05:32,768 --> 01:05:33,928
- You should come over here

1163
01:05:33,969 --> 01:05:35,560
and pick out something
on the rack.

1164
01:05:35,603 --> 01:05:37,264
- Oh, I brought my own.

1165
01:05:37,304 --> 01:05:39,899
- That's not how
we do things here, sweetie.

1166
01:05:39,941 --> 01:05:41,635
- Thinking too much.

1167
01:05:41,675 --> 01:05:43,666
- Somebody's got to.
- Ah, shh.

1168
01:05:43,711 --> 01:05:44,678
- Are you kidding me?

1169
01:05:44,712 --> 01:05:46,145
You know those are mine.

1170
01:05:46,180 --> 01:05:47,340
- Quit touching me,
you bitch!

1171
01:05:47,381 --> 01:05:48,348
- What are you gonna do
about it?

1172
01:05:48,382 --> 01:05:49,349
- Hey!

1173
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:52,375
[all yelling]

[all cheering]

1175
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:05,695
Behave yourselves.

[all cheering]

1177
01:06:27,653 --> 01:06:29,211
- That's mine.

¶ ¶

1180
01:07:01,085 --> 01:07:02,074
- Oh, yeah.

1181
01:07:09,193 --> 01:07:10,989
- She's out.

1182
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,393
She is out.

1183
01:07:33,482 --> 01:07:35,416
She's out.

1184
01:07:40,789 --> 01:07:41,778
- Come on, come on, come on.

1185
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,189
That's what I'm talking about.

1186
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,419
- She's out!

1187
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:59,337
- Finish her!
Finish her!

1188
01:07:59,374 --> 01:08:00,739
- Get up.

1189
01:08:00,775 --> 01:08:02,402
- She's out!

1190
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:09,781
- Congratulations
to you all thus far.

1191
01:08:09,817 --> 01:08:11,842
And the pairing is as follows.

1192
01:08:11,886 --> 01:08:14,945
FF4 will face FF3.

1193
01:08:14,988 --> 01:08:17,286
FF10 will face FF2.

1194
01:08:17,324 --> 01:08:19,724
FF7 will face FF13.

1195
01:08:19,760 --> 01:08:23,355
And FF5 will face FF1.

1196
01:08:23,397 --> 01:08:25,889
Thank you, and good luck.

1197
01:08:32,206 --> 01:08:33,696
- Donald.

1198
01:08:38,478 --> 01:08:40,275
Why is it that my fighter

1199
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:42,509
ends up with Nasha
this early in the pool?

1200
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:45,949
- Sonny, this is good
for you.

1201
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:47,111
People here know

1202
01:08:47,153 --> 01:08:48,780
what all the fighters can do
except yours.

1203
01:08:48,821 --> 01:08:50,881
Look at the odds.
She's 15 to 1 already.

1204
01:08:50,924 --> 01:08:53,188
If she wins,
imagine the payout.

1205
01:08:55,494 --> 01:08:57,791
- All right, I'll buy that.

1206
01:08:57,829 --> 01:08:59,957
Why is Nedish talking
with all the other managers?

1207
01:08:59,999 --> 01:09:01,489
- Since when
is talking a crime?

1208
01:09:01,534 --> 01:09:03,467
- When he's the one
doing the talking.

1209
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:07,836
- Sonny, you just make sure
your fighter is ready.

1210
01:09:07,873 --> 01:09:09,841
Have a little drink.
Make a little party.

1211
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,739
I'll take care of everything.

1212
01:09:11,776 --> 01:09:13,107
Okay?

1213
01:09:17,882 --> 01:09:19,873
[bell dings]

1214
01:09:29,194 --> 01:09:31,219
- Come on.

1215
01:09:33,297 --> 01:09:35,288
- Pick it up.
Pick it up.

1216
01:09:37,501 --> 01:09:38,798
Don't let her back you up.

1217
01:09:45,242 --> 01:09:46,732
- She's out!

1218
01:09:46,777 --> 01:09:47,835
- Whoo!

1219
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:50,210
Kicked your fighter's booty!

1220
01:09:50,247 --> 01:09:52,043
[bell dings]

1221
01:09:57,820 --> 01:09:59,185
- Come on, Cindy.

1222
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:06,355

- [grunting]

1227
01:10:35,657 --> 01:10:37,317
- Stay patient.

1228
01:10:44,298 --> 01:10:45,663
Stay patient.

1229
01:10:52,239 --> 01:10:54,230
- She is out!

1230
01:10:58,546 --> 01:10:59,706
- Hey, Sam.

1231
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:02,181
Sonny, wait a minute.

1232
01:11:02,215 --> 01:11:03,512
Sonny, come on.

1233
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,950
We had worse fights
when we was kids.

1234
01:11:04,985 --> 01:11:05,951
Listen.

1235
01:11:05,985 --> 01:11:07,043
If your girl keeps winning,

1236
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:08,612
maybe we should talk
a little business.

1237
01:11:08,656 --> 01:11:10,213
What do you say?

1238
01:11:10,256 --> 01:11:11,780
- I think
he's getting nervous.

1239
01:11:11,825 --> 01:11:13,122
- No, I'm not nervous.

1240
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:14,525
I'm just looking
to make a killing.

1241
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:15,789
Aren't we all?

1242
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:17,194
Come on, Sonny.
- Getting nervous.

1243
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:18,697
- He's nervous.

1244
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:20,791
- All right, Sonny.
I'll be here.

1245
01:11:24,637 --> 01:11:25,604
- Move it.

1246
01:11:25,638 --> 01:11:26,696
- Good luck to you, Scuba.

1247
01:11:26,740 --> 01:11:28,799
- Come on, get in there, babe.

1248
01:11:28,842 --> 01:11:30,433
Show them what you got.

- [screaming]

1251

- Let's get a win,
Boom Boom.

1252
01:11:39,485 --> 01:11:42,010
I got dinner reservations.

1253
01:11:42,054 --> 01:11:43,953
Let's go.
Let's see what you got.

1254
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:45,320
Give it to her!

1255
01:11:45,357 --> 01:11:47,985
- Yeah, all right!

1256
01:11:48,026 --> 01:11:49,391
Come on, girlie.

1257
01:11:49,428 --> 01:11:51,293

- Stay down.
Stay down.

- She is out!

1262
01:12:10,248 --> 01:12:11,909
- Boom, boom.

1263
01:12:13,818 --> 01:12:16,309
Looks like you'll make
those reservations, Scuba.

1264
01:12:17,488 --> 01:12:19,079
Well done, baby.
That's how we roll.

1265
01:12:19,122 --> 01:12:20,089
- Thank you.

1266
01:12:20,123 --> 01:12:21,590
- Okay, come on.

1267

01:12:36,840 --> 01:12:38,671
- Yes, sir, I promise you,

1270
01:12:38,708 --> 01:12:41,801
I promise I'll pay you
as soon as I can.

1271
01:12:41,844 --> 01:12:42,811
- Is that right?

1272
01:12:42,845 --> 01:12:43,937
- Yes.

1273
01:12:45,314 --> 01:12:48,977
[screaming]

1274
01:12:49,018 --> 01:12:51,486
My finger!

1275
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,181
My finger!

1276
01:12:57,392 --> 01:12:59,826
- Once again, you've turned this
into a fantastic event.

1277
01:12:59,861 --> 01:13:00,953
- I know.

1278
01:13:00,995 --> 01:13:03,760
Nedish,
do you have a problem?

1279
01:13:03,799 --> 01:13:05,425
You're not happy
with the arrangement?

1280
01:13:05,467 --> 01:13:07,958
- What? Not happy?

1281
01:13:08,002 --> 01:13:09,664
Well, no. Why?

1282
01:13:09,705 --> 01:13:11,695
- A few of my guests
think you're fixing the fight

1283
01:13:11,739 --> 01:13:13,207
in your favor.

1284
01:13:13,241 --> 01:13:14,970
- Well, no,
I spoke to a few managers

1285
01:13:15,009 --> 01:13:16,237
and simply told them

1286
01:13:16,277 --> 01:13:18,643
that if their girls
were to lose, not to worry.

1287
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:19,840
I would carry their action.

1288
01:13:19,881 --> 01:13:21,280
- Why would you do that?

1289
01:13:21,316 --> 01:13:23,216
- Why?

1290
01:13:23,251 --> 01:13:24,740
Because I want their money.

1291
01:13:24,785 --> 01:13:26,151
[laughs]

1292
01:13:26,187 --> 01:13:27,279
I want their money, Donald.

1293
01:13:27,322 --> 01:13:28,983
You see, my offer
keeps them in the game,

1294
01:13:29,023 --> 01:13:30,512
and it fattens the pot.

1295
01:13:30,557 --> 01:13:33,048
- Sonny thought some
of the fights were pushovers.

1296
01:13:33,093 --> 01:13:34,527
- Sonny, Sonny, Sonny.

1297
01:13:34,562 --> 01:13:35,688
Let me tell you about Sonny.

1298
01:13:35,730 --> 01:13:37,287
He's nothing
but a two-bit hustler,

1299
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:39,458
and at the end of the day,
Mona is the best.

1300
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:40,831
Come tomorrow's fight night,

1301
01:13:40,868 --> 01:13:42,859
you're not gonna have
to worry about anybody else.

1302
01:13:42,903 --> 01:13:44,097
- You seem pretty excited, huh?

1303
01:13:44,137 --> 01:13:45,729
- I love to watch Mona work.

1304
01:13:45,772 --> 01:13:47,170
- She has not yet won.

1305
01:13:47,206 --> 01:13:48,298
- Well, when that time comes,

1306
01:13:48,341 --> 01:13:49,934
maybe we could have
a little wager.

1307
01:13:51,711 --> 01:13:53,042
- We'll see.

1308
01:13:53,079 --> 01:13:54,171
We'll see.

1309
01:13:54,213 --> 01:13:56,681
- Okay, I'll see you.

1310
01:14:13,466 --> 01:14:16,492
- So what are your thoughts
on the purchase?

1311
01:14:18,604 --> 01:14:21,572
- I don't think anyone
knows a thing.

1312
01:14:21,606 --> 01:14:23,131
It's the right time.

1313
01:14:30,415 --> 01:14:31,814
- Don't make me angry.

1314
01:14:37,188 --> 01:14:39,382
- No eye gouging,
no biting.

1315
01:14:39,423 --> 01:14:40,789
Now, back to your corners.

1316
01:14:40,825 --> 01:14:42,417
- Jeff, good fight.

1317
01:14:42,460 --> 01:14:43,449
- Good luck.

1318
01:14:44,962 --> 01:14:46,794
[bell dings]

1319
01:14:46,831 --> 01:14:47,819
- Fight!

1320
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:51,334
- You want a piece of this, huh?

1321
01:14:51,368 --> 01:14:52,335
- Get in there.

1322
01:14:52,369 --> 01:14:53,336
Let's go.

1323
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:54,337
Come on.

1324
01:14:54,371 --> 01:14:57,363
[people cheering]

1325
01:14:59,443 --> 01:15:00,739
- Oh, my--

1326
01:15:00,777 --> 01:15:02,039
Get out of there!

1327
01:15:02,078 --> 01:15:03,478
Get out of the corner!

1328
01:15:03,514 --> 01:15:05,846
- Come on, you got her!

1329
01:15:05,883 --> 01:15:06,907
- Yeah!

1330
01:15:06,951 --> 01:15:09,145
- Keep your hands up.

1331
01:15:10,688 --> 01:15:12,655
- Don't back off, now.

1332
01:15:15,425 --> 01:15:16,585
- Get out of there!

1333
01:15:16,626 --> 01:15:18,491
- Get out of that corner,
out!

1334
01:15:18,528 --> 01:15:19,893
- Yeah!

1335
01:15:19,929 --> 01:15:21,020
- Get up.

1336
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:22,531
- That's it.

1337
01:15:22,565 --> 01:15:24,863
- She's out!

1338
01:15:28,705 --> 01:15:29,763
[bell dings]

1339
01:15:29,806 --> 01:15:30,795
Fight.

1340
01:15:35,177 --> 01:15:36,611
- Come on, Mona.

1341
01:15:36,646 --> 01:15:39,671
- I'm sorry,
was that your kidneys?

1342
01:15:39,715 --> 01:15:41,410
Let's dance.

1343
01:15:41,450 --> 01:15:42,883
- Get her, Mona.

1344
01:15:42,918 --> 01:15:44,010
- Watch it, Trixie.

1345
01:15:47,723 --> 01:15:48,712
- Come on.

1346
01:15:54,128 --> 01:15:55,220
- Whoo!

1347
01:15:55,262 --> 01:15:56,958
[light applause]

1348
01:16:01,202 --> 01:16:02,636
- Get her. Get her.

1349
01:16:11,945 --> 01:16:12,913
- Roadkill.

1350
01:16:12,946 --> 01:16:14,174
- Nice.

1351
01:16:16,549 --> 01:16:18,574
- She's out!

1352
01:16:18,618 --> 01:16:19,983
- Come on out.
Get some rest.

1353
01:16:20,020 --> 01:16:20,987
Tex, listen to me.

1354
01:16:21,021 --> 01:16:22,648
Tomorrow's the final fight.

1355
01:16:22,689 --> 01:16:23,987
I want you to make
an announcement

1356
01:16:24,025 --> 01:16:25,821
that I will personally
take all action on Mona.

1357
01:16:25,859 --> 01:16:26,985
You got it?
- Right, boss.

1358
01:16:27,027 --> 01:16:28,324
Take all action on Mona.

1359
01:16:28,361 --> 01:16:29,385
- You got it.

1360
01:16:29,429 --> 01:16:31,329
Come here, baby.

1361
01:16:31,364 --> 01:16:32,490
It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

1362
01:16:32,532 --> 01:16:33,590
- Where's a towel?

1363
01:16:35,035 --> 01:16:36,024
- Come on, Sam.

1364
01:16:38,638 --> 01:16:41,903
Sammy,
I need to talk to you.

1365
01:16:41,941 --> 01:16:43,669
- Okay.

1366
01:16:43,709 --> 01:16:46,007
- When Sonny first asked me
to take you on,

1367
01:16:46,045 --> 01:16:48,343
I wasn't sure
about your skills.

1368
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:51,679
But now that I've
seen you fight,

1369
01:16:51,717 --> 01:16:54,345
I think you're our chance
to make a big score.

1370
01:16:54,386 --> 01:16:58,482
- Sammy, we have
great confidence in you.

1371
01:16:58,524 --> 01:17:00,014
You're a wonderful fighter.

1372
01:17:00,059 --> 01:17:01,424
Tomorrow night,

1373
01:17:01,460 --> 01:17:04,019
you're gonna fight
the fight of your life.

1374
01:17:05,964 --> 01:17:07,989
- Nedish is betting
everything he has against you.

1375
01:17:08,033 --> 01:17:09,364
- I'm lost.

1376
01:17:09,401 --> 01:17:11,631
- We've waited a long time
to get back at Nedish.

1377
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,467
And we think we can
through you.

1378
01:17:15,606 --> 01:17:17,096
- All right,
to make a long story short,

1379
01:17:17,141 --> 01:17:18,733
we'll cover tonight
with Xavier.

1380
01:17:20,244 --> 01:17:22,109
- Very nice.

1381
01:17:22,146 --> 01:17:23,408
- Now, when Nedish loses,

1382
01:17:23,448 --> 01:17:25,006
he's not gonna be able
to cover his debts,

1383
01:17:25,049 --> 01:17:27,313
so Loften's gonna have
to pick up all his markers,

1384
01:17:27,351 --> 01:17:32,219
and I assure you that that'll be
the last we see of Mr. Nedish.

1385
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:35,088
- And if I lose?

1386
01:17:35,126 --> 01:17:36,092
- I'm dead.

1387
01:17:36,126 --> 01:17:38,390
Explain that.

1388
01:17:38,428 --> 01:17:42,762
- Sammy,
you're not gonna lose.

1389
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:55,009
- Hey, baby.

1390
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:01,373
You know, Loften thinks he's
gonna run this event forever.

1391
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:03,681
But the truth is, these people
come to see you, baby,

1392
01:18:03,719 --> 01:18:06,017
not him but you.

1393
01:18:07,957 --> 01:18:08,924
Don't you worry.

1394
01:18:08,958 --> 01:18:10,289
If all goes well,

1395
01:18:10,326 --> 01:18:13,352
I'll be running The Show
real soon, baby.

1396
01:18:13,395 --> 01:18:16,295
- Yeah, babe.
I just want you to be careful.

1397
01:18:16,331 --> 01:18:18,095
Loften's a powerful guy.

1398
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:21,034
And you're right.

1399
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:23,971
They do come to see me,

1400
01:18:24,006 --> 01:18:25,472
not him

1401
01:18:25,507 --> 01:18:30,069
and definitely
not you, Nedish.

1402
01:18:30,111 --> 01:18:31,669
Me.

1403
01:18:36,851 --> 01:18:38,045
- Come here.

1404
01:18:38,086 --> 01:18:39,848
Don't you ever, ever
talk to me

1405
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:41,411
like that again,
you understand me?

1406
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,185
Don't you ever talk to me
like that.

1407
01:18:43,224 --> 01:18:45,158
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1408
01:18:45,193 --> 01:18:46,524
- Yeah.

1409
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:48,323
- Okay, baby.
You're good.

1410
01:18:48,362 --> 01:18:49,522
Come here. Come here.

1411
01:18:49,563 --> 01:18:50,587
- What's up, Nedish?

1412
01:18:50,631 --> 01:18:52,599
- Hey, Scuba, how you doing?

1413
01:18:52,633 --> 01:18:54,225
- Boom Boom.

1414
01:18:54,268 --> 01:18:55,496
- Come on, let's go.

1415
01:18:55,536 --> 01:18:57,333
- Boom Boom.

1416
01:18:57,371 --> 01:18:58,895
- Good luck to you.

1417
01:19:08,314 --> 01:19:11,307
[engine rumbling]

1418
01:20:05,569 --> 01:20:08,402
- And you're fast.

1419
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:10,771
- I'm the one who runs things
around here, okay?

1420
01:20:10,808 --> 01:20:13,504
These opportunities will come,
and they will go.

1421
01:20:17,915 --> 01:20:19,506
- There are no rules in here.

1422
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,689
- [whispers indistinctly]

1423
01:21:06,728 --> 01:21:08,024
Today.

1424
01:21:09,530 --> 01:21:10,758
Time to wake up.

1425
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,104
Yesterday.

1426
01:21:19,173 --> 01:21:20,970
Today.

1427
01:21:23,544 --> 01:21:24,533
- Ma'am.

1428
01:21:44,431 --> 01:21:46,398
[no audible dialogue]

1429
01:22:49,626 --> 01:22:51,992
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1430
01:22:52,029 --> 01:22:54,896
tonight is what we've all
been waiting for:

1431
01:22:54,931 --> 01:22:57,900
the final $500,000
winner-take-all,

1432
01:22:57,934 --> 01:23:00,425
no-limit,
full-contact fight

1433
01:23:00,470 --> 01:23:03,962
between two
of the toughest, sexiest

1434
01:23:04,007 --> 01:23:06,532
bare-knuckle fighters
in the world.

1435
01:23:09,211 --> 01:23:11,111
- It is a beautiful evening
for violence.

1436
01:23:11,147 --> 01:23:13,241
The moon is shining.

1437
01:23:13,283 --> 01:23:16,410
Champagne flows freely.

1438
01:23:17,886 --> 01:23:20,321
Never forget the sacrifice

1439
01:23:20,356 --> 01:23:24,292
that these fighters
have made for all of us.

1440
01:23:24,326 --> 01:23:26,260
Make sure you bet freely.

1441
01:23:26,295 --> 01:23:29,525
Make sure you bet well.

1442
01:23:29,564 --> 01:23:32,500
And so let us begin.

1443
01:23:32,535 --> 01:23:34,365
[applause]

1444
01:23:34,402 --> 01:23:37,098
- Nedish, what's the odds?

1445
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:40,005
- I've told you not
to long shot your money, okay?

1446
01:23:40,041 --> 01:23:41,303
- The odds.

1447
01:23:41,342 --> 01:23:43,367
- If I was you, I'd get her
out of this racket, okay,

1448
01:23:43,411 --> 01:23:45,879
because she really
has a beautiful face.

1449
01:23:45,914 --> 01:23:47,711
I hope you can remember,
the last time they met,

1450
01:23:47,749 --> 01:23:49,046
it wasn't so pretty.

1451
01:23:49,084 --> 01:23:52,884
Rumor has it that your girl
still may have a few weaknesses.

1452
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:55,218
4 to 1.

1453
01:23:55,255 --> 01:23:57,553
- Okay, I got $250,000.

1454
01:23:57,591 --> 01:23:59,685
At 4 to 1,
that's 1 million bucks.

1455
01:23:59,726 --> 01:24:00,886
Can you cover the bet?

1456
01:24:00,928 --> 01:24:02,054
- [laughs]

1457
01:24:02,096 --> 01:24:03,996
You?
You're kidding me, right?

1458
01:24:04,031 --> 01:24:05,361
Come on.

1459
01:24:05,399 --> 01:24:08,163
Oh, no, I can back it,
but your fighter can't.

1460
01:24:08,202 --> 01:24:09,191
Done.

1461
01:24:09,236 --> 01:24:10,328
Take the bet, Tex.

1462
01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,530
- Yes, boss.

1463
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:14,166
- Thanks.

1464
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,869
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1465
01:24:16,909 --> 01:24:20,869
welcome to The Show!

1466
01:24:20,914 --> 01:24:25,543
[applause]

1467
01:24:25,586 --> 01:24:27,348
Please let me introduce,

1468
01:24:27,386 --> 01:24:30,116
from the wrong side
of the tracks,

1469
01:24:30,156 --> 01:24:34,354
Mayhem Mona.

1470
01:24:34,393 --> 01:24:37,384
[cheers and applause]

1471
01:24:45,103 --> 01:24:49,336
And her challenger
for this evening

1472
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:54,003
is Samantha Rogers!

1473
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:57,037
[applause]

1474
01:25:04,388 --> 01:25:07,153
This will be
a three-round fight.

1475
01:25:07,192 --> 01:25:10,183
Hold your hats,
place your bets,

1476
01:25:10,227 --> 01:25:12,195
and let's get ready
to roll!

1477
01:25:12,229 --> 01:25:15,221
[cheers and applause]

1478
01:25:18,569 --> 01:25:20,867
- Sam, you're here

1479
01:25:20,905 --> 01:25:23,169
because you're supposed
to be here.

1480
01:25:23,207 --> 01:25:26,176
You have the power,
and you got the grace,

1481
01:25:26,210 --> 01:25:27,677
which is a gift.

1482
01:25:27,711 --> 01:25:29,507
All right?

1483
01:25:29,546 --> 01:25:32,538
[applause]

1484
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,711
- No eye gouging
and no biting.

1485
01:25:39,756 --> 01:25:42,190
Back to your corners.

1486
01:25:45,929 --> 01:25:46,918
Let's fight!

1487
01:25:46,963 --> 01:25:48,089
[bell dings]

1488
01:26:16,624 --> 01:26:17,818
- There it is.
There it is.

1489
01:26:17,858 --> 01:26:18,825
That's it.

1490
01:26:18,859 --> 01:26:20,953
That's it!

1491
01:26:20,995 --> 01:26:21,963
- Bring her into you.

1492
01:26:21,997 --> 01:26:23,157
Bring her into you.

1493
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:36,866
[bell dings]

1494
01:26:36,910 --> 01:26:37,878
- Time!

1495
01:26:37,912 --> 01:26:41,847
[applause]

1496
01:26:41,881 --> 01:26:42,848
- Good.

1497
01:26:42,882 --> 01:26:43,974
That was good.

1498
01:26:44,017 --> 01:26:45,985
- Sam, it doesn't matter
how fast she is.

1499
01:26:46,019 --> 01:26:47,008
You're smarter.

1500
01:26:47,053 --> 01:26:48,816
Stay focused and in control,
okay?

1501
01:26:48,855 --> 01:26:50,447
- Do me a favor.
- Yeah?

1502
01:26:50,490 --> 01:26:52,321
- Just put a little more
pressure on her.

1503
01:26:52,359 --> 01:26:53,656
- I already did.

1504
01:26:53,693 --> 01:26:55,183
- Put more.

1505
01:26:55,228 --> 01:26:57,286
More, more, baby.
She's dead.

1506
01:26:57,329 --> 01:26:59,025
- She can't hurt me.
I don't feel her power.

1507
01:26:59,065 --> 01:27:00,965
- Good to know, baby.
Good to know.

1508
01:27:01,001 --> 01:27:02,525
All right, don't let her
get to the third round.

1509
01:27:02,569 --> 01:27:03,593
Try and finish her
in the next round.

1510
01:27:03,637 --> 01:27:04,865
- I don't plan on it.
I've got it.

1511
01:27:04,904 --> 01:27:06,803
- Okay, baby, good.
I like it.

1512
01:27:06,839 --> 01:27:07,806
Okay.

1513
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,034
[bell dings]

1514
01:27:12,278 --> 01:27:13,245
- Fight!

1515
01:27:13,279 --> 01:27:14,268
- Come on, Sam.

1516
01:27:36,734 --> 01:27:38,463
- Yeah!
Come on!

1517
01:27:47,312 --> 01:27:48,836
- Don't wait, Mona.

1518
01:27:48,880 --> 01:27:50,905
Don't wait!

1519
01:28:16,305 --> 01:28:17,397
- One.

1520
01:28:17,440 --> 01:28:18,465
- Suck it up.

1521
01:28:18,508 --> 01:28:21,135
- Come on, Sam.
All that training.

1522
01:28:21,177 --> 01:28:23,475
- Two.
- How bad do you want it?

1523
01:28:23,512 --> 01:28:24,911
- Three.

1524
01:28:24,947 --> 01:28:27,438
- I'm gonna throw it in
if you don't stand up.

1525
01:28:27,483 --> 01:28:29,882
Stand up.

1526
01:28:29,918 --> 01:28:31,546
- You can do this.
Suck it up.

1527
01:28:31,587 --> 01:28:32,884
- You want it, Sammy.
- Five.

1528
01:28:32,922 --> 01:28:33,980
- I'm gonna call it.

1529
01:28:34,023 --> 01:28:36,491
- Six.

1530
01:28:36,525 --> 01:28:38,116
[people chattering]

1531
01:28:41,196 --> 01:28:43,290
- You got it.

1532
01:28:43,332 --> 01:28:44,299
[bell dings]

1533
01:28:44,333 --> 01:28:45,993
- Time!

1534
01:28:46,034 --> 01:28:47,296
Time!

1535
01:28:47,335 --> 01:28:48,324
- Get off!

1536
01:28:52,607 --> 01:28:55,542
- Look, this is your time now,
all right?

1537
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:56,975
Suck it up.
Think about it.

1538
01:28:57,010 --> 01:28:58,444
- You get that pain
out of your head.

1539
01:28:58,480 --> 01:28:59,446
Nothing hurts.

1540
01:28:59,480 --> 01:29:00,572
You're a warrior.

1541
01:29:00,614 --> 01:29:02,809
This is round three,
your final round.

1542
01:29:02,850 --> 01:29:04,010
It's your time, okay, Mona?

1543
01:29:04,051 --> 01:29:05,985
- How bad do you want this?
Look at me.

1544
01:29:08,056 --> 01:29:10,546
- It's your time, baby.

1545
01:29:10,591 --> 01:29:11,888
We talked about this.

1546
01:29:11,925 --> 01:29:13,517
- Everything
you learned before.

1547
01:29:13,560 --> 01:29:14,754
It's everything.

1548
01:29:14,795 --> 01:29:15,762
Come on.

1549
01:29:15,796 --> 01:29:17,319

1551
01:29:23,670 --> 01:29:24,967

1552
01:29:25,005 --> 01:29:26,596

1553
01:29:26,639 --> 01:29:28,073
- Come on.

1554
01:29:55,568 --> 01:29:58,730

And the winner of this year's

- You just keep on trucking,
don't you?

1582
01:32:11,497 --> 01:32:14,262
- Did something change?

1583
01:32:14,301 --> 01:32:17,428
- Well, I was thinking--

1584
01:32:17,469 --> 01:32:20,961
I mean, I thought--

1585
01:32:41,159 --> 01:32:44,651
- Today is time to wake up.

1586
01:32:45,663 --> 01:32:49,155
- [vocalizing]

1587
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,792
