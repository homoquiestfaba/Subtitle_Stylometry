1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 DivX.............
2
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,120
Swann.

3
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,720
And the fire said to me...

4
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,320
" Nix, Nix,

5
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
you are my instrument.

6
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,280
From now on you shall be known...

7
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
as...

8
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,360
the Puritan.

9
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,200
You will find a few good men...

10
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,720
and women...

11
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,080
and together...

12
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,400
together...

13
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,840
you will cleanse the world. "

14
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,480
Master.

15
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,240
Swann's here.

16
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,320
Are we ready?

17
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,760
- Ready.
- Maybe we should think about this.

18
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,320
He's gone too far.

19
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,920
So he took a kid.

20
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,480
He's gonna kill her.

21
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,760
He could drive us crazy.

22
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,840
So stay out here!

23
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,200
Please get away from me.

24
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,600
Hush!

25
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,520
Please don't hurt me!

26
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,120
I said, hush.

27
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,960
What is it?

28
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,960
What's the matter, huh?

29
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,600
Please! Please!

30
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,120
What are you gonna do to me?

31
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,480
Leave me alone!

32
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,360
Want me to shoot, Swann?

33
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,240
Leave me alone!

34
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,480
You don't like him, do you?

35
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,840
- He wants her magic.
- Maybe.

36
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,920
Go! Fetch him.

37
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,520
I think he's in love.

38
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,680
If you see the kid, yell.

39
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,880
- Quaid.
- Hey, man.

40
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,360
It's Quaid.

41
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,920
I thought you weren't
coming back.

42
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,600
I changed my mind.

43
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,640
You can't leave, man.

44
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
He won't let you.

45
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,280
You're gonna be okay.

46
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,640
Okay?

47
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,680
I knew you'd come.

48
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,640
I've got so much power
to give you, Swann.

49
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,560
All you have to do...

50
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
is beg.

51
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Fuck you.

52
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,200
You don't think
that I've got it to give?

53
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
You're wrong!

54
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,080
I could eat your fucking soul!

55
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,480
Now be a good girl.

56
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,320
Fuck!

57
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,520
Stay here.

58
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,200
- Jennifer, are you okay?
- Jesus!

59
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,840
Stay away.

60
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,760
Stay the fuck away.

61
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,520
Are you okay?

62
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,880
How would you like...

63
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,240
to see the world...

64
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,520
the way it really is?

65
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,600
You wanna see flesh...
with a god's eyes?

66
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,320
Swann?

67
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,720
Here he is.

68
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
Take a look, Swann.

69
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,600
These are your friends.

70
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,920
What have you done to him?

71
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,360
- Swann--
- Don't touch me!

72
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,600
He got into my head!

73
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,360
You wanna be like that, Swann?

74
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,880
Mud? Shit?

75
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,960
Come here.

76
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,840
Share the power.

77
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,520
Swann.

78
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,520
Help me.

79
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,320
Bag.

80
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,880
Help me.

81
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:58,680
- What are you doing?
- Binding you.

82
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,800
You piece of shit!

83
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,400
This isn't over, Swann.

84
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
This isn't finished.

85
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,320
Dead?

86
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,240
Dead.

87
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,600
What now?

88
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,080
We bury him so deep...

89
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,720
no one will ever find him.

90
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,720
I been calling you
for three days, Harry.

91
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,640
I missed you too, Loomis.

92
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,640
You got a beer?

93
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,960
I got a job for you...

94
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,920
if you can tear yourself away
from all this weird shit.

95
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,560
You need a woman's touch
in here.

96
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,320
Why don't you get yourself
a secretary?

97
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,000
On what you pay me?

98
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,520
So get married.

99
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,200
Tried that.

100
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh, yeah.

101
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,840
" Harry D'Amour, who describes himself
as a private detective...

102
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,960
has been linked with occult activities
on several occasions.

103
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,040
'We regard D'Amour
as a highly dubious character...'

104
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,360
quoted one source. "

105
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,760
That's nice, Harry.

106
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,880
It's all bullshit.

107
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,480
It was on TV last night.

108
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,160
You looked like shit,
by the way.

109
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,040
- Thanks.
- What's the story?

110
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,960
Was the kid really possessed?

111
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,720
Probably.

112
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,840
By what?

113
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,120
You know.

114
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,560
The usual.

115
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,880
You need a vacation.

116
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,120
Somewhere sunny, like...

117
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,480
L.A.

118
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,720
That's where the job is?

119
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,600
Guy's name's Tapert.
Big insurance fraud.

120
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,520
He's gone west to spend
his ill-gotten gains.

121
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,040
It's worth ten grand...

122
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,960
if you catch him doing it.

123
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,080
If I don't?

124
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,360
Catch a tan.

125
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,640
I need someone of your caliber
on this, Harry.

126
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,760
Taste the darkness, D'Amour.

127
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,480
It's been waiting for you.

128
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,440
Yeah, well, maybe I do
need a vacation.

129
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,720
You'll like L.A.

130
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,760
There's great weather,
great women.

131
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,480
- Here you go.
- Thanks. Have a nice evening.

132
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,960
You bet.

133
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,880
Hello, L.A.

134
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,520
9:18 p.m.

135
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,720
Tapert's paying by the hour.

136
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,680
He's getting his money's worth.

137
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Come here, you fuckers!
Come on in!

138
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
Wait a minute.

139
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,160
He's late for something.

140
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,760
What the hell?

141
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,320
Ever watched a man die?

142
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,320
If you watch very closely...

143
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,720
you can sometimes
see the soul escaping.

144
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,640
And if you're very quick...

145
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,200
you can catch it.

146
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,360
I wasn't there.

147
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,400
Ask Pimm.

148
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,840
Pimm's dead.

149
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,400
Jennifer Desiderio's
disappeared.

150
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,840
They knew the Puritan
was coming home.

151
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,600
So did you.

152
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,600
Wait.

153
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,040
Don't leave me.

154
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,520
Did you come for a reading?

155
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,800
My God.

156
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,600
What?

157
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,760
You are drawn
to the dark side...

158
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,160
over and over.

159
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,440
You don't like that.

160
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,880
Not much.

161
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:34,080
You can't change it.

162
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,760
You must walk the line...

163
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,680
between heaven and hell.

164
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,480
It is your destiny.

165
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,920
Accept it.

166
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,000
Hang on.

167
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,680
I'm not afraid to die.

168
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840
There's something terrible...

169
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,640
coming home soon.

170
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
The Puritan?

171
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,280
Who is he?

172
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,480
Shit.

173
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,640
What were you doing up here?

174
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,080
I'm a private detective.

175
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:43,920
I was hired to follow a guy
named Tapert for a couple of days.

176
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,560
- Insurance fraud.
- Tapert.

177
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,320
So now I've got Tapert,
Butterfield--

178
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,720
Tapert's got nothin'
to do with this.

179
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,120
He just came
to get his palm read.

180
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,640
This is something else.

181
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,680
You ever heard of somebody
called the Puritan?

182
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,600
New one on me.
Let's see him.

183
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,200
Where the fuck is he?

184
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,040
He got up and walked.

185
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,080
After that fall,
he would've broken half his bones.

186
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:18,160
I don't think
he'd have given a shit.

187
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,800
D'Amour.

188
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,360
Why do I know that name?

189
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,520
I know him.

190
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,960
I saw him on TV.

191
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,160
Some kid got possessed,
and he saved the little bastard's life.

192
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,720
A priest?

193
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,600
He's just some guy...

194
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,800
who's got a nose for this shit.

195
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,720
Like you.

196
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,880
I don't want him
getting in the way.

197
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,560
He won't.

198
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,400
We've, all of us,
waited too long...

199
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,120
to have the homecoming spoiled.

200
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,560
What do you mean,
" all of us " ?

201
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,320
A lot of people
believed in Nix.

202
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,720
They haven't forgotten
his promise.

203
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,600
About?

204
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,040
Death.

205
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,600
What about death?

206
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,200
It's an illusion.

207
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,440
Coffee, Mrs. Swann?

208
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,360
Yes, thank you.

209
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,600
Where's Mr. Swann?

210
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,200
In his study.

211
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,640
He got something on his mind?

212
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,440
Hey. Mr. Sunshine.

213
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,640
That's what I'm gonna call you.

214
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,760
Bad show?

215
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,640
The usual.

216
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,920
Full house.

217
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,680
Standing ovation.

218
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,360
I tell them it's magic.

219
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,120
They believe you.

220
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,560
Yeah.

221
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,440
Remember Quaid?

222
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,520
Sure.

223
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,080
I think they killed him.

224
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,840
Oh, God.

225
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,800
I just saw him too.

226
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,080
I'm putting in
a new illusion tonight.

227
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,040
Something special.
I want you to be there.

228
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,440
Of course.

229
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,640
You want me
to find out about Quaid?

230
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,800
- I mean, the funeral?
- No.

231
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm not going anywhere near him.

232
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,280
Higher.

233
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,480
Another inch.

234
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,040
The left hand side is too low.

235
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,720
Valentin?

236
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,680
Good. There.

237
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,240
Yes?

238
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,640
I want you to find
this man D'Amour for me.

239
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,560
Shit.

240
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,320
Mr. D'Amour.

241
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,760
Go away.

242
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,000
It's 1:00 in the afternoon.

243
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,160
Who are you, my mother?

244
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,280
I'm here to offer you
a job, Mr. D'Amour.

245
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,560
I'm going back to New York.

246
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:11,000
Have you got something in New York
that'll pay you 5,000 a day?

247
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,960
Do I get lunch?

248
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,120
Whose car?

249
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,640
Mine.

250
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:29,040
No, it's not.
You're driving it too carefully.

251
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,440
Maybe I just bought it.

252
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,440
Well, somebody's been
smoking in here for months.

253
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,680
Havanas.

254
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,720
You're not the smoker.

255
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,320
So, who is?

256
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,200
You'd almost pass
for a detective, D'Amour.

257
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,720
I work for the best illusionist
in the world.

258
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,280
- Philip Swann?
- You know of him?

259
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,280
Kinda hard to miss him.

260
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,280
I saw him perform once
in Vegas.

261
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,240
Are you a gambling man?

262
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,200
Swann is quite a magician.

263
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,520
Never call him that.

264
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,360
He's strictly an illusionist.

265
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,800
What's the difference?

266
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,320
Illusions...

267
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,760
are trickery.

268
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,880
Magicians do it for real.

269
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,480
Where'd the flower go?

270
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,280
Any movie stars buried here?

271
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,840
Probably.

272
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,440
It's not a bad place.
It's warm, lots of palm trees.

273
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,320
I don't think the dead
much care.

274
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,760
You sure?

275
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,240
- Are you a believer, then?
- Oh, yeah.

276
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,120
I signed on for all of them
in my time.

277
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,120
Catholic, Hindu, Moonies.

278
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,520
You can't have
too many saviors.

279
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,400
Who's that?

280
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,680
Swann's wife.

281
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,680
I want you to help me
help my husband.

282
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,480
He's in some kind of trouble-- something
to do with the man you saw murdered.

283
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,720
I think Philip believes
all that stuff with the tarot cards.

284
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,240
And you don't?

285
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,680
I think we make
our own futures.

286
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,880
So, what's the connection?

287
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
I don't exactly know.

288
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,640
Philip doesn't like to talk
about the past.

289
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,080
Why not?

290
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,560
He's a secretive man.

291
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,720
And you don't ask questions?

292
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,640
We don't share our lives
the way a lot of people do.

293
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,560
But obviously
you still care about him.

294
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:16,440
We wouldn't be having
this conversation if I didn't.

295
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,640
Swann is one of the most
remarkable men alive.

296
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,480
You don't believe me?

297
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,240
He's an illusionist.
That's not exactly brain surgery.

298
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,160
I'm sorry. You asked.

299
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,640
No, you're right.

300
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,560
He could've been something more.

301
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,040
Maybe a lot more.

302
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,880
But sometimes people get lost.
Even good people.

303
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,480
- Too much money, too much fame.
- Where do I sign up?

304
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,360
Will you take the job,
Mr. D'Amour?

305
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,880
- Harry.
- Harry.

306
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,120
When do you want me to start?

307
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,480
Come to the show with me.

308
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,880
It's his last performance
in L.A. tonight.

309
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:13,040
I want you to see him with an audience.
They love him.

310
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,080
Do you?

311
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:19,600
I didn't marry him for love,
Mr. D'Amour.

312
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
- Tonight?
- Sure.

313
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,480
Okay.

314
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,240
Excuse me.

315
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,640
Sorry.

316
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,400
- I'm glad you could make it.
- Are you kidding?

317
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,320
This is a big deal for me.

318
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,840
I gotta have the tux back
by midnight.

319
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,560
Valentin!

320
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,960
I'm here.

321
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:45,640
The guy with Dorothea--
is that him?

322
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,360
- Check if he's ready.
- Ready?

323
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,920
Ready.

324
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,760
How the fuck does he do that?

325
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,280
It's wires.

326
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:35,360
- I don't see no wires.
- So, what is it? Magic?

327
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,280
Ladies and gentlemen...

328
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:43,120
you are standing on the threshold
of a miracle.

329
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:23,120
Come with me
into the great beyond.

330
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,920
He's good.

331
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,840
You haven't seen anything yet.

332
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,440
This is the new illusion.

333
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,840
Have you seen this before?

334
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,120
There's something wrong here.

335
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,360
For God's sake!

336
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,640
Wait! Who are you?

337
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,240
Oh, God.

338
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,520
Please.

339
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,960
Please, Dorothea.

340
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,680
Come away.

341
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,280
It's no use.

342
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,960
I got you, you fucker!

343
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,480
Who did this, D'Amour?

344
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,080
Who killed Swann?

345
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,240
You did.

346
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,880
Didn't you?

347
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,000
Why would I?

348
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,840
Beats me.

349
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,720
You don't have a clue
what you're into, do you?

350
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,960
I feel it!

351
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,600
Deep shit?

352
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,840
Who did this?

353
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,560
It was...

354
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,720
It was...

355
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,600
And this Butterfield guy?

356
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,720
Vanished.

357
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:20,200
Another fucking magician.
Jesus.

358
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,760
You through with me?

359
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,160
For now.

360
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,640
You planning on moving back
to New York?

361
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,520
No, not yet.

362
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,360
- They treating you all right?
- Yeah.

363
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,600
I heard what happened.

364
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:04,560
I think I'm gonna
stick around for a while.

365
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,240
Maybe dig in places
that cops wouldn't look.

366
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,960
I wouldn't know
where you'd start.

367
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,200
Maybe with the other illusionists?

368
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,840
They won't tell you anything.

369
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,600
I can be very persuasive.

370
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,960
Yeah.

371
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,200
I think you probably can.

372
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,120
Scotch on the rocks.

373
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,640
Where did you learn that?

374
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,840
Oh, this stuff?
At birth.

375
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:16,480
Are you a professional, or did you
just come here to watch the shows?

376
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:18,440
A bit of both.

377
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,680
I know most of the young kids
who are coming up...

378
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,120
but didn't recognize you.

379
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,040
Well, I'm in from New York.

380
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,040
I came out to see Swann.

381
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,880
Yeah, Swann. Swann.

382
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,880
Jeez, that was a tragedy.

383
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:40,080
The general thinking around this place
was that it was just a question of time.

384
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,760
He was taking a lot of risks?

385
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,240
You'd better believe it.

386
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,720
A lot of risks.

387
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,840
My name's Walter Wilder,
by the way.

388
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,080
Not the Walter Wilder.

389
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,680
Dear boy,
the one and the only.

390
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,680
Take a couple of cards
and try this nonsense.

391
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,360
If you knew Swann,
you must have known Vinovich.

392
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:06,480
Yeah.

393
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,960
Vinovich knew Swann
way, way back.

394
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,600
He said there were a lot of drugs
around, a lot of crazy shit.

395
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,160
Let me ask you something...
Walter.

396
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:21,360
I'd love to hang
with you guys for a while.

397
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,600
Magicians are
a pretty cagey bunch.

398
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,720
I suppose it's a question of
who do you know?

399
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,320
Actually, nobody.

400
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,040
Well, you do now.

401
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,320
Now, down here is
what they call the repository.

402
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,400
Behind those locked doors...

403
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,080
lies every secret of magic
known to mankind.

404
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,880
- Ever been in there?
- Me? No.

405
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,200
No, there are only three keys.

406
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,440
Vinovich has got one,
of course.

407
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,720
It is more than entertainment.

408
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,280
We are opening up people's heads.

409
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,960
We are bringing miracles
back into their miserable little lives.

410
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,920
But they're fake miracles.

411
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,640
Houdini believed
he had spirit guides.

412
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:16,080
Do you believe that?

413
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,520
I believe...

414
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,360
that we walk a narrow path...

415
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,440
between--

416
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,760
Heaven and hell?

417
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,360
Divinity and trickery.

418
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,320
So then, sometimes...

419
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,880
the miracles are real.

420
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,880
No. They are always fake.

421
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:37,200
The saints, the messiahs,
they were just illusionists.

422
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:39,120
You could walk on water?

423
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:43,920
I can reproduce any miracle
that has ever been performed...

424
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:45,680
with a little preparation.

425
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:48,040
Even one of Swann's?

426
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,720
- They were no damn good.
- Really?

427
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:55,360
That's funny.
I heard he was one of the best.

428
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:58,240
If he was so good,
why is he so dead?

429
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,360
You tell me.

430
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,040
I figured
you'd have some theory.

431
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,880
I have many theories.

432
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:11,240
I'd like to hear one of them.

433
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,360
I'm not saying another word.

434
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,800
You damn fool, Wilder.

435
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,520
This man is a journalist.

436
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:23,120
No, I'm not a journalist.
I just wanted to know about Swann.

437
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,160
He was a freak.

438
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,440
Everything he did was tainted.

439
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,760
- With what?
- Evil!

440
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,240
He was evil.

441
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,840
Are you coming?

442
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:43,560
Do not speak to this man
if you wish to keep my company.

443
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,760
That's a great accent.
What is it, Brooklyn?

444
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,360
Fuck you, all right?

445
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:05,320
Harry.

446
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,840
I've got to be careful.

447
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:31,480
- If Vinovich sees me talking to you--
- What do you want, Billy?

448
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:33,440
I heard a name.

449
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,360
Someone they talk about
in whispers.

450
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,760
Who?

451
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,040
Nix.

452
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,120
He's dead now,
but I think maybe he taught Swann.

453
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:48,280
Who's doing the talking?

454
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,120
Vinovich.

455
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,040
But you burned
your bridges there.

456
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,440
This is me.

457
00:48:58,720 --> 00:48:59,920
Good luck.

458
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,400
I loved what you did in there.

459
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,880
What are you looking at?

460
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:24,840
I just want to know what Philip saw in
those cards and stop it from happening.

461
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,040
Divinity and trickery.

462
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,920
Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.

463
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,400
I know it's late.

464
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,040
It's okay.

465
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,120
How'd it go today?

466
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,400
Went up to the Magic Castle.

467
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:25,040
You were right. He didn't
have a lot of friends up there.

468
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,640
They were jealous of him.

469
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:29,200
Why?
Because he had you?

470
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,760
He didn't have me.
I told you.

471
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,040
Yeah, you didn't marry him
for love.

472
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,040
So, why did you marry him?

473
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,000
That's none of your business,
Harry.

474
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:45,080
You ever hear of somebody
called Nix?

475
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,560
Dorothea?

476
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,920
Yeah, I'm here.

477
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:00,840
I don't know the name.

478
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,080
What about Jennifer Desiderio?

479
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,240
It doesn't ring a bell.

480
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,960
I have to go.

481
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,440
That's it?

482
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:14,000
All right.
Look, I'll keep digging.

483
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:16,400
Yeah. You do that.

484
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,840
" Keep Out
Police Department "

485
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,720
Ever watched a man die?

486
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:34,960
Yes.

487
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:47,960
" Desiderio. "

488
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,480
What are you doing here?

489
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,400
Looking for you.

490
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:07,600
- I tried the hotel.
- So why you'd come here?

491
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:10,160
You're a detective
with no clues.

492
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,080
Where else would you look?

493
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,160
Do you mind?

494
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:18,080
I'll keep this brief.

495
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:21,440
Here's $30,000.

496
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:24,160
What for?

497
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,760
A ticket home.

498
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,840
You didn't hire me. She did. She wants
me to stop, I wanna hear it from her.

499
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:33,680
- She doesn't want to see you.
- No?

500
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,280
- People are dying here.
- Yes.

501
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,920
It's a terrible tragedy.

502
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,160
Is that all you have to say?

503
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:44,200
It's a fucking terrible tragedy?

504
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,240
- I want to know why.
- Why people die?

505
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,520
Give it up, D'Amour.
Go home.

506
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,560
Don't try to see her, D'Amour.

507
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,680
Just leave her alone.

508
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,800
Lock up, will you?

509
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:08,920
Jennifer has only ever had
one visitor.

510
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,400
- Mr. Quaid?
- Right.

511
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,960
- He's dead, isn't he?
- Yeah.

512
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,920
Heard it on the news.

513
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:18,840
Jennifer doesn't know...

514
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:21,600
and frankly, this isn't
the best time for her to be told.

515
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:23,320
I won't say anything.

516
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,600
She's been with us for four years
and she was coming along nicely.

517
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,080
Past month she's been
worst than ever.

518
00:54:32,120 --> 00:54:35,440
- What's her problem?
- She has no real grip on reality.

519
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,880
- Does anybody?
- Oh, yes.

520
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,520
We have to agree on what's real and not.
That's what holds us together.

521
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,640
What does Jennifer think
is real?

522
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,680
She thinks the devil's
coming for her.

523
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:53,000
Have we met before?

524
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,800
Only I forget.

525
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,440
They give me pills, you know,
to make me even.

526
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:05,240
And I...

527
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,080
I forget things.

528
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:08,600
You didn't forget me.

529
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:15,360
I just came to see if you remembered
a man named Butterfield.

530
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,800
Maybe. I...

531
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:28,680
That's okay.
What about Philip Swann?

532
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:33,920
I knew Swann.

533
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,160
He's a fucking liar.

534
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,720
Why is that?

535
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:41,680
He said he knew
how to protect us.

536
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,360
But he didn't know anything.

537
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,640
He made us think
it was over and done with.

538
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:50,280
What was?

539
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,800
I don't wanna think about it.

540
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,880
If I think about it, he'll...

541
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,800
he'll hear me.

542
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:01,560
He'll find me.

543
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,400
Swann?

544
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,360
I told you. I don't want...

545
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,040
What is it?

546
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:15,600
Calm down.

547
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,120
No, he'll get me!

548
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,400
He's not-- He's not--

549
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,240
Who's not gonna get you?

550
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,840
