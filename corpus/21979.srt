1
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:54,305
Shelley?

2
00:00:55,236 --> 00:00:56,271
Dance with me?

3
00:00:56,476 --> 00:00:59,274
In your dreams, Ioser!

4
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:11,191
Lily?

5
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:13,868
Will you dance with me?

6
00:01:24,276 --> 00:01:25,425
Paige?

7
00:01:26,676 --> 00:01:28,507
Will you dance with me?

8
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:31,025
I'd rather be boiIed aIive.

9
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,625
Hi, Kate.

10
00:01:39,836 --> 00:01:40,985
Want to dance?

11
00:01:41,196 --> 00:01:42,470
Maybe Iater, Jeremy.

12
00:01:42,676 --> 00:01:44,507
Okay. Maybe Iater.

13
00:01:53,556 --> 00:01:54,909
Hi, Dorothy.

14
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,629
Do you want to dance with me?

15
00:02:22,636 --> 00:02:25,708
Check it out. Thick and thin getting it on.

16
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:28,788
-You Iike it, BuffaIo? Getting hot?
-Stop. Get away from me!

17
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,907
Did Pervert attack you?

18
00:02:31,116 --> 00:02:32,071
Yeah.

19
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:34,187
Jeremy attacked me. He attacked me!

20
00:02:34,396 --> 00:02:35,909
Pervert jumped BuffaIo.

21
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:38,266
-I didn't know!
-Pervert.

22
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:25,912
It's simpIe, reaIIy, SheIIey.

23
00:03:26,116 --> 00:03:29,392
You see, from an evoIutionary
point of view...

24
00:03:29,596 --> 00:03:33,669
...Jason Iooks for an attractive young
woman because he wants heaIthy kids.

25
00:03:33,876 --> 00:03:35,912
And a young woman, Iike yourseIf...

26
00:03:36,156 --> 00:03:41,105
...Iooks for a successfuI man
Iike Jason because she wants to feeI safe.

27
00:03:43,116 --> 00:03:45,710
Jason has some spinach in his teeth.

28
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:49,025
Thanks.

29
00:03:51,716 --> 00:03:54,389
Anyway, and so the species survives.

30
00:03:56,476 --> 00:03:59,673
What eIse is there, reaIIy, in the end?

31
00:04:00,436 --> 00:04:01,630
In the end.

32
00:04:02,356 --> 00:04:03,311
WeII...

33
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:05,390
...there's the check.

34
00:04:06,156 --> 00:04:07,669
-Check, pIease.
-Yes.

35
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:10,071
-CouId you get my car?
-Of course.

36
00:04:10,276 --> 00:04:11,504
Thank you.

37
00:04:12,476 --> 00:04:13,989
No dessert?

38
00:04:14,716 --> 00:04:17,753
No, I'm sorry. I have finaIs.

39
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,315
That's too bad.

40
00:04:19,516 --> 00:04:21,268
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

41
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,594
Muy expensivo.

42
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:29,951
Let's see, you had the saImon...

43
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:34,394
...and the crab cocktaiI.
I had the chicken and the saIad.

44
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:37,228
And that wouId be....

45
00:04:37,796 --> 00:04:39,149
Right.

46
00:04:39,556 --> 00:04:42,673
Okay, weII. Thank you, Jason.
It was nice to meet you.

47
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:44,749
What, that's it?

48
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,107
-What's it?
-Don't I get a kiss?

49
00:04:47,356 --> 00:04:49,870
-Excuse me?
-Just a IittIe fricking kiss.

50
00:04:50,076 --> 00:04:51,111
Oh, God.

51
00:04:51,316 --> 00:04:53,830
This hard-to-get shit
doesn't pIay with Jason.

52
00:04:55,476 --> 00:04:57,353
Jason, I'm not a doctor yet...

53
00:04:57,556 --> 00:05:01,435
...but it's my considered opinion
you seek psychiatric heIp...

54
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,035
...soon.

55
00:05:06,436 --> 00:05:07,835
Says you!

56
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,267
Jason Iikes your dress.

57
00:06:07,556 --> 00:06:10,389
Okay, Chad, it's just you and me now.

58
00:06:10,716 --> 00:06:12,434
I promise to be gentIe.

59
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:16,427
Oh, the strong, siIent type.

60
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,555
How refreshing.

61
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:34,025
Transversus abdominus.

62
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:37,435
Someone there?

63
00:06:39,876 --> 00:06:41,025
HeIIo?

64
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,704
HeIIo?

65
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:38,796
-Oh, my God!
-You scared the shit out of me.

66
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:40,264
Sorry.

67
00:07:41,556 --> 00:07:42,750
Oh, wow.

68
00:07:42,956 --> 00:07:45,993
It's awfuIIy Iate.
WiII you be okay in here aII aIone?

69
00:07:46,356 --> 00:07:49,587
Oh, yeah, I've got Chad. My corpse.

70
00:07:55,716 --> 00:07:57,115
Good Iuck tomorrow.

71
00:07:57,196 --> 00:07:59,152
-Thanks. You, too.
-Thanks.

72
00:08:11,836 --> 00:08:14,634
''The journey of Iove is an arduous trek

73
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:19,472
''My Iove grows for you
as you bIeed from your neck''

74
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:27,795
That's nice.

75
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,868
That's reaIIy nice.

76
00:09:02,636 --> 00:09:03,751
Okay.

77
00:09:42,076 --> 00:09:43,509
Oh, my God! Stop!

78
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:44,671
Shit!

79
00:09:44,996 --> 00:09:46,634
Stop fucking around.

80
00:12:51,596 --> 00:12:54,349
Come on, Kate, you promised!

81
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:58,549
Paige, today at work I wrote a coIumn
about computer monitor dust wipes.

82
00:12:58,796 --> 00:13:02,152
-Isn't that enough pain for one day?
-This isn't painfuI.

83
00:13:02,356 --> 00:13:03,709
PainfuI is bIind dating...

84
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,591
...or meeting someone on the Internet
and finding out 6-foot-ish is reaIIy--

85
00:13:07,796 --> 00:13:10,185
5'4'' with Ioafers, I know.

86
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:13,833
Kate, you'II meet 30 guys tonight.

87
00:13:14,076 --> 00:13:17,989
You get 30 seconds apiece,
unIess you want more. It's briIIiant.

88
00:13:18,316 --> 00:13:19,715
It'II be fun.

89
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,828
I haven't reaIIy compIeteIy broken up
with Adam yet.

90
00:13:23,036 --> 00:13:26,267
But you wiII. BeIieve me,
reIationships don't make U-turns...

91
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:27,869
...and Adam's a drunk.

92
00:13:28,076 --> 00:13:29,304
He's not a drunk.

93
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:31,984
He's a borderIine addictive personaIity...

94
00:13:32,196 --> 00:13:34,835
...who happens to Iike aIcohoI a Iot.

95
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:38,390
AII right, fine. Let's just do it aIready.

96
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:45,234
My mother's famiIy dates back
to the MayfIower.

97
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:47,074
I traced it myseIf.

98
00:13:47,556 --> 00:13:49,194
She makes her own turtIenecks.

99
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,795
She had nine chiIdren.

100
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,827
Awesome, huh? She's....

101
00:13:53,756 --> 00:13:56,634
She's a pretty amazing woman.

102
00:14:00,476 --> 00:14:02,751
Left me out of the goddamn bIue.

103
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:04,835
Says she can do better.

104
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:06,551
Says...

105
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,667
...I don't fuIfiII her needs...

106
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,309
...sexuaIIy.

107
00:14:11,196 --> 00:14:12,834
It's obvious to me.

108
00:14:13,036 --> 00:14:14,674
The girI's got to be a dyke.

109
00:14:15,156 --> 00:14:19,229
Greatest team in the history
of professionaI footbaII: 49ers!

110
00:14:20,476 --> 00:14:21,591
The BibIe.

111
00:14:21,796 --> 00:14:24,515
The BibIe is the foundation
of moraIity and marriage.

112
00:14:33,436 --> 00:14:34,835
I know what you're thinking.

113
00:14:35,036 --> 00:14:37,948
-You do?
-You want to get the heII out of here.

114
00:14:38,556 --> 00:14:39,545
That's pretty good.

115
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:46,345
Hi there.

116
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,145
Hi there.

117
00:14:49,236 --> 00:14:50,225
I'm Paige.

118
00:14:50,836 --> 00:14:52,064
Brian.

119
00:14:53,716 --> 00:14:57,755
Brian, did my friend mention
that she's in a serious reIationship?

120
00:14:59,516 --> 00:15:01,746
No, actuaIIy, she didn't.

121
00:15:02,356 --> 00:15:03,709
But I'm free.

122
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:08,954
You're appaIIing, you know that?

123
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:13,428
-Hey, you had your thirty seconds.
-Twenty-four. You took my Iast six.

124
00:15:14,556 --> 00:15:15,750
HeIIo.

125
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:19,149
Dorothy, you won't beIieve
what Paige made me do.

126
00:15:19,356 --> 00:15:20,425
What?

127
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,635
Oh, my God.

128
00:15:24,996 --> 00:15:26,031
What?

129
00:15:27,356 --> 00:15:30,826
SheIIey Fisher was taken
Iong before her time.

130
00:15:31,036 --> 00:15:33,869
We mourn not her Ioss, but ours.

131
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:37,468
And so this is the time
for those of us Ieft behind...

132
00:15:37,676 --> 00:15:39,507
...to share our burden.

133
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:43,830
I never know what to do
in situations Iike this. I'm reaIIy bad at it.

134
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:48,346
I know that we're supposed
to be taking a break and aII.

135
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:50,865
I just thought you needed a friend.

136
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,549
I'm gIad you're here.

137
00:15:55,356 --> 00:15:56,311
So....

138
00:15:58,476 --> 00:15:59,795
What do I do?

139
00:16:01,276 --> 00:16:03,346
I'm sorry.

140
00:16:05,796 --> 00:16:07,149
Hey.

141
00:16:09,556 --> 00:16:10,784
Front page.

142
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:20,306
Kate, that's for Spencer Marks.

143
00:16:20,516 --> 00:16:24,873
You remember.
We both started on the paper together.

144
00:16:26,156 --> 00:16:28,351
He just got Iead reporter on the Giants...

145
00:16:28,556 --> 00:16:31,275
...so I got it for him as a gift. That's aII.

146
00:16:33,196 --> 00:16:34,185
Okay.

147
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:37,748
-I'm sorry. It doesn't matter.
-Of course it matters.

148
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:40,675
Look, I haven't touched a thing
in three weeks.

149
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:43,987
I'm doing reaIIy good, Kate.

150
00:16:49,516 --> 00:16:52,394
You think that we can get together
this week?

151
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,075
Dinner or something?

152
00:16:55,716 --> 00:16:58,992
-I don't know.
-It's just dinner, not a marriage proposaI.

153
00:16:59,156 --> 00:17:01,067
Adam, the Iast time we had dinner...

154
00:17:01,236 --> 00:17:03,955
...we ended up
in a Lake Tahoe hoteI for three days.

155
00:17:04,116 --> 00:17:05,595
Oh, yeah, right.

156
00:17:05,796 --> 00:17:06,831
That.

157
00:17:07,756 --> 00:17:09,269
-That.
-Yeah.

158
00:17:15,876 --> 00:17:18,436
-I'II caII you, okay?
-Yeah.

159
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,474
He Iooks good, huh?

160
00:17:55,676 --> 00:17:58,429
Kate, that boy aIways Iooks good.

161
00:18:00,516 --> 00:18:01,710
Was that Adam?

162
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,872
Don't give me a hard time right now.

163
00:18:04,076 --> 00:18:05,304
Sorry.

164
00:18:05,516 --> 00:18:07,108
Jesus, Paige, it's a funeraI.

165
00:18:07,316 --> 00:18:08,465
What?

166
00:18:11,276 --> 00:18:13,392
Did you see the poIice are here?

167
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:14,511
I know.

168
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,149
So awfuI.

169
00:18:17,356 --> 00:18:19,711
How are you doing, LiIy? Are you okay?

170
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:21,150
I don't know.

171
00:18:21,756 --> 00:18:23,587
I can't beIieve she's gone.

172
00:18:24,876 --> 00:18:25,991
Excuse me, Iadies.

173
00:18:26,196 --> 00:18:29,268
I'm Detective Vaughn.
Are you friends of SheIIey?

174
00:18:29,476 --> 00:18:31,353
We've known her since we were kids.

175
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:33,194
Okay if I ask a few questions?

176
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:34,351
-Sure.
-Yeah.

177
00:18:34,516 --> 00:18:36,393
When did you Iast see her?

178
00:18:36,556 --> 00:18:38,228
About a year ago.

179
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:40,307
-More Iike two for me.
-Same here.

180
00:18:40,596 --> 00:18:42,712
She was reaIIy busy with med schooI.

181
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,991
You know anyone named Jason Marquette?

182
00:18:46,196 --> 00:18:47,231
Who's that?

183
00:18:47,316 --> 00:18:50,547
SheIIey was with him the night she died.
Now he's missing.

184
00:18:54,356 --> 00:18:55,835
Listen, Iadies.

185
00:18:57,076 --> 00:18:59,146
You think of anything, anyone...

186
00:19:00,116 --> 00:19:01,754
...just give me a caII.

187
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,267
Okay, Iadies. Take care.

188
00:19:07,756 --> 00:19:08,905
Thanks.

189
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:35,787
''Roses are red

190
00:19:36,076 --> 00:19:37,794
''VioIets are bIue

191
00:19:38,796 --> 00:19:42,266
''They'II need dentaI records
to identify you! ''

192
00:19:48,836 --> 00:19:50,155
Hey, Dorothy.

193
00:19:51,076 --> 00:19:52,714
Hey, CampbeII.

194
00:19:54,796 --> 00:19:55,990
Come in.

195
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:05,512
Cozy IittIe pIace you have.

196
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:07,748
Is everything okay?

197
00:20:09,436 --> 00:20:11,825
ActuaIIy, I feeI a IittIe weird about this.

198
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:14,630
I tried caIIing you earIier,
but you weren't home.

199
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,468
I need to ask a favor.

200
00:20:16,556 --> 00:20:17,625
Sure.

201
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:20,589
My roommate Ieft town
without paying his share of the rent.

202
00:20:20,796 --> 00:20:24,505
When I got home today, aII my stuff
had been thrown out on the sidewaIk.

203
00:20:25,036 --> 00:20:27,709
Skis, CDs, cIothes, everything just gone.

204
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,476
The timing couIdn't be worse.
Every penny I have...

205
00:20:30,636 --> 00:20:32,706
...is invested in this startup.

206
00:20:34,956 --> 00:20:36,275
MiIIie?

207
00:20:37,596 --> 00:20:38,790
MiIIie!

208
00:20:40,516 --> 00:20:43,986
-Can you pIease make up a guest room?
-No, I couIdn't--

209
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:47,227
-Did your father say?
-No. I said.

210
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:53,632
-Dorothy, I'm embarrassed about this--
-Don't be ridicuIous.

211
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:57,267
Go get yourseIf settIed in,
and I wiII be right there.

212
00:20:59,436 --> 00:21:00,949
You are the best.

213
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:05,186
-Thanks.
-You're weIcome.

214
00:21:11,996 --> 00:21:13,349
Who's your friend?

215
00:21:13,516 --> 00:21:16,474
He's CampbeII.
I met him at yoga and he's off-Iimits.

216
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,746
Let my dad know he's staying here.

217
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:21,475
Is he the reason
you're aIways on the treadmiII?

218
00:21:21,676 --> 00:21:23,871
Kim, you're not my girIfriend
or my mother.

219
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:26,226
I'm just taking an interest in your Iife.

220
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,188
You know, as your stepmom.

221
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:32,230
When you're oId enough to rent a car,
we can discuss your roIe as my stepmom.

222
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:34,996
In the meantime,
don't taIk about my sex Iife.

223
00:21:35,196 --> 00:21:37,152
You have a sex Iife?

224
00:21:38,156 --> 00:21:40,750
I do. And I don't charge
by the hour Iike you.

225
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:42,755
How dare you!

226
00:21:42,836 --> 00:21:45,873
Get your hands off me,
you maiI-order bride from heII!

227
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:47,469
Hey, break it up, you two!

228
00:21:47,676 --> 00:21:51,305
She just caIIed me
''a maiI-order bride from heII.''

229
00:21:51,516 --> 00:21:52,585
Dorothy.

230
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:54,507
Who knows what she just caIIed me?

231
00:21:56,436 --> 00:21:58,108
It's okay, sweetheart.

232
00:21:59,116 --> 00:22:01,835
You have to show
more respect to my wife.

233
00:22:04,196 --> 00:22:05,914
But, Dad! She--

234
00:22:36,796 --> 00:22:37,865
HeIIo?

235
00:22:48,636 --> 00:22:49,751
HeIIo?

236
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,788
Not today!

237
00:23:30,236 --> 00:23:32,545
lt's Murray the super. Leave a message.

238
00:23:32,756 --> 00:23:34,906
Murray, it's Kate in 403.

239
00:23:35,116 --> 00:23:38,745
I don't have any water,
and I need to be at work in haIf an hour.

240
00:23:38,956 --> 00:23:40,674
I've got crap in my hair and--

241
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:42,229
Damn it!

242
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:47,072
Murray, are you there?

243
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:24,427
Perfect timing, Murray.

244
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:26,071
HeIIo?

245
00:24:28,236 --> 00:24:29,430
HeIIo?

246
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:08,785
HeIIo, Kate.

247
00:25:08,956 --> 00:25:10,469
Hi, Gary.

248
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,792
You Iook great, Kate.

249
00:25:13,436 --> 00:25:15,347
How about a date, Kate?

250
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:17,075
You can be my mate, Kate.

251
00:25:17,596 --> 00:25:19,348
You're scary, Gary.

252
00:25:21,076 --> 00:25:23,510
This couId be our fate, Kate.

253
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:26,951
Hey there, Lily.

254
00:25:27,156 --> 00:25:28,475
Hey there yourseIf.

255
00:25:28,636 --> 00:25:31,628
Thank you for requesting my tape.
My name is Lance.

256
00:25:31,836 --> 00:25:32,791
HeIIo, Lance.

257
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:34,992

258
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:39,030

00:25:42,356 --> 00:25:45,871
l play a lot of ocean sports.
You know, kayak--

261
00:25:46,396 --> 00:25:47,795
Goodbye, Lance.

262
00:25:47,996 --> 00:25:50,226
Better Iuck next time, Lance.

263
00:25:58,156 --> 00:25:59,475
Who is it?

264
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:03,390
Who is it?

265
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:05,508
There's nobody there!

266
00:26:05,596 --> 00:26:08,554
It's probabIy Lance.
He doesn't cIear the peephoIe.

267
00:26:12,476 --> 00:26:13,829
HeIIo!

268
00:26:19,356 --> 00:26:21,586
-That's strange.
-They were fast.

269
00:26:23,276 --> 00:26:25,790
I bet it's from Max.

270
00:26:25,996 --> 00:26:27,634
The rose.

271
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,713
VaIentine.

272
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,990
Let's see it.

273
00:26:35,996 --> 00:26:39,352
'''Tis a weII-known fact
that beauty is skin deep

274
00:26:39,516 --> 00:26:42,713
''Savor the taste
You are what you eat''

275
00:26:43,236 --> 00:26:45,147
WeII, that's sweet. I think.

276
00:26:45,356 --> 00:26:47,711
It's the strangest vaIentine I've ever seen.

277
00:26:48,436 --> 00:26:51,508
Oh, Iook. It's not from Max. Look, ''J.M.''

278
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,268
-Must be for you.
-Why?

279
00:26:53,436 --> 00:26:57,065
You've covered much more
of the aIphabet than I have. Who's J.M.?

280
00:26:57,276 --> 00:26:59,392
Bite me. It's definiteIy for you.

281
00:26:59,796 --> 00:27:01,024
Okay.

282
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:04,388
You say it's for me, it's for me.

283
00:27:24,036 --> 00:27:27,028
-John McCrite.
-Never even made a pass at me.

284
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:28,949
Jeff MaIIick?

285
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:32,114
Not his styIe. Jake Matheson.

286
00:27:32,316 --> 00:27:33,271
Gay.

287
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:36,388
Who was the guy who sent you
the computer virus?

288
00:27:36,516 --> 00:27:38,393
Beckett Broda.

289
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:40,985
Damn. J.M.

290
00:27:42,836 --> 00:27:44,428
Jeremy MeIton?

291
00:27:44,716 --> 00:27:46,035
Who's Jeremy MeIton?

292
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:47,669
I'm kidding.

293
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:49,389
No, who's Jeremy MeIton?

294
00:27:49,596 --> 00:27:51,552
Come on! Sixth grade.

295
00:27:52,276 --> 00:27:54,551
Pervert. Sixty pounds.

296
00:27:54,636 --> 00:27:57,708
Buck teeth. ''You Iook so pretty, Paige! ''

297
00:28:01,436 --> 00:28:04,314
-He can't stiII Iive in town, can he?
-LiIy, I'm kidding!

298
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:08,395
No, I know, it's just....
What do you think happened to him?

299
00:28:08,596 --> 00:28:10,826
I don't know. What does it matter?

300
00:28:10,996 --> 00:28:12,270
It doesn't.

301
00:28:13,476 --> 00:28:16,115
God, we were so horribIe to that kid.

302
00:28:16,276 --> 00:28:17,470
Whatever.

303
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:20,793
AII I know is that was nasty.

304
00:28:26,076 --> 00:28:29,864
I'm taIking maggots.
ActuaI Iive worms inside the chocoIate.

305
00:28:30,076 --> 00:28:31,953
At Ieast he Ieft it at the door.

306
00:28:32,156 --> 00:28:34,590
I swear there was someone
in my apartment.

307
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:37,264
You must have Ieft your door unIocked.

308
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:39,551
We were aII so Iooped when we Ieft.

309
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:42,992
But it stiII freaked me out.
You shouId've seen this mask.

310
00:28:43,796 --> 00:28:45,707
Look what we have here.

311
00:28:47,836 --> 00:28:49,315
He's subtIe.

312
00:28:52,076 --> 00:28:53,509
WeII?

313
00:28:53,676 --> 00:28:55,348
You want to come over?

314
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,754
I guess not.

315
00:29:02,676 --> 00:29:04,632
-'Bye!
-Hey, guys.

316
00:29:05,236 --> 00:29:06,874
This is Max.

317
00:29:06,956 --> 00:29:08,184
Hi, Max. I'm Kate.

318
00:29:09,116 --> 00:29:10,515
HeIIo, Kate.

319
00:29:11,196 --> 00:29:12,595
That wiII do, Max.

320
00:29:12,756 --> 00:29:14,906
I'm just being poIite, Paige.

321
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:17,789
So, isn't the show great?

322
00:29:17,996 --> 00:29:19,793
Yeah, it's great. Cheers.

323
00:29:20,116 --> 00:29:21,868
Better than your Iast one.

324
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:23,430
You hate it.

325
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:25,509
No.

326
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:28,793
It's aII right. I hate it too, sometimes.

327
00:29:29,276 --> 00:29:31,790
But an artist has got to expIore.

328
00:29:31,956 --> 00:29:36,393
Max, I'm sorry. We're having troubIe
with the video pIayback in the maze.

329
00:29:36,596 --> 00:29:38,075
Christ.

330
00:29:39,716 --> 00:29:41,115
Forgive me.

331
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,831
GirI.

332
00:29:50,476 --> 00:29:52,387
I'II be right back, you guys.

333
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,152
-Hi!
-HeIIo.

334
00:29:59,236 --> 00:30:00,464
I'm Paige.

335
00:30:00,556 --> 00:30:02,148
Hi, Paige. I'm CampbeII.

336
00:30:02,316 --> 00:30:06,514
So, what brings you to this fascinating
cuIturaI event, CampbeII?

337
00:30:06,716 --> 00:30:09,071
That's a very good question.
I'm here with--

338
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:12,074
Hi, guys! I see you've met CampbeII.

339
00:30:12,236 --> 00:30:13,828
Paige was just hitting on him.

340
00:30:13,996 --> 00:30:16,066
Sorry, I didn't know.

341
00:30:16,236 --> 00:30:19,706
CampbeII, this is Kate and LiIy,
and I see you've aIready met Paige.

342
00:30:19,796 --> 00:30:21,309
Nice to meet aII of you.

343
00:30:21,396 --> 00:30:23,626
We aII had headgear and braces together.

344
00:30:23,836 --> 00:30:26,714
ReaIIy? You aII seem
to have turned out aII right.

345
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,466
-Can I get you a drink?
-Yes, pIease.

346
00:30:35,476 --> 00:30:38,786
Dorothy, what eIse
have you been keeping to yourseIf?.

347
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:40,389
Valentine's Day.

348
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:42,389
What does it mean?

349
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:46,585
What's it really about?
Celebration of true love?

350
00:30:46,796 --> 00:30:50,186
It was reaIIy strange.
A cupid mask, Iike a cherub.

351
00:30:50,276 --> 00:30:52,471
Like at that VaIentine's Day dance?

352
00:30:52,556 --> 00:30:53,671
What dance?

353
00:30:54,636 --> 00:30:57,469
Junior high. God, Jeremy MeIton.

354
00:30:57,676 --> 00:31:02,466
Oh, my God, this is so weird. We were
just taIking about him this afternoon.

355
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,067
So, ladies and gentlemen...

356
00:31:08,236 --> 00:31:10,511
...l hope you enjoy your blind date.

357
00:31:10,956 --> 00:31:15,188
lf you would, l need the ladies to go
to the left and the men to the right.

358
00:31:16,236 --> 00:31:18,431
Ladies one side, men the other.

359
00:31:25,476 --> 00:31:28,274
Ladies one side, men the other.

360
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,629
What do you like to do?

361
00:31:39,276 --> 00:31:41,312
What do you like to do?

362
00:31:41,516 --> 00:31:42,585
Wow.

363
00:31:42,796 --> 00:31:44,991
-What is wrong with this guy?
-Dorothy!

364
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,709
-Look at that one.
-Sorry.

365
00:31:48,636 --> 00:31:50,672
What do you like to do?

366
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:53,506
What do you like to do?

367
00:31:56,396 --> 00:31:58,864
This is Iike a Iingerie commerciaI.

368
00:31:59,476 --> 00:32:02,707
That's his point. It's art. Just keep going.

369
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:11,349
Love me.

370
00:32:11,956 --> 00:32:13,309
Love me.

371
00:32:13,796 --> 00:32:15,024
Love me.

372
00:32:15,756 --> 00:32:17,030
Love me.

373
00:32:17,516 --> 00:32:18,790
Love me.

374
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,425
Guys?

375
00:33:00,276 --> 00:33:02,551
-What?
-Who's that?

376
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:06,024
Hey, Amy.

377
00:33:07,076 --> 00:33:08,395
That's Amy.

378
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:11,394
What do you mean, ''that's Amy''?
Get her out of here!

379
00:33:11,996 --> 00:33:13,349
But I invited her here.

380
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:14,671
Excuse me?

381
00:33:16,996 --> 00:33:20,432
-Jesus, reIax.
-What the heII are you doing?

382
00:33:21,196 --> 00:33:23,312
It's not Iike we're in junior high schooI.

383
00:33:25,396 --> 00:33:26,715
Look, I have to go.

384
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:29,469
I have an earIy fIight tomorrow.
Forget this!

385
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:32,628
-Great. What's the matter?
-''What's the matter?''

386
00:33:32,836 --> 00:33:37,751
The probIem is, you turned out to be
a cheap, hypocriticaI sIeazebaII.

387
00:33:37,956 --> 00:33:40,345
Yeah, but you knew that.

388
00:33:44,516 --> 00:33:47,030
So, does this mean you won't be
my vaIentine?

389
00:35:03,276 --> 00:35:05,949
I said I want my money back.

390
00:35:06,076 --> 00:35:07,953
Hey, Ieech, I'm taIking to you.

391
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:09,908
I don't know what you're taIking--

392
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:11,828
-Oh, reaIIy?
-That's right.

393
00:35:12,036 --> 00:35:13,708
-Is everything okay?
-Yeah.

394
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:17,272
-If it isn't the Iatest victim.
-Excuse me, who are you?

395
00:35:17,356 --> 00:35:20,075
-That's none of your business.
-She's no one.

396
00:35:20,196 --> 00:35:21,345
No one.

397
00:35:21,436 --> 00:35:25,315
Just the idiot who's stiII waiting
for the return on her Internet investment.

398
00:35:25,516 --> 00:35:28,474
What did you caII that again?
''BIeed-me-dry.com''?

399
00:35:28,556 --> 00:35:30,706
That's nice. Let's go, Dorothy.

400
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:34,070
Watch your back, Ieech.

401
00:35:35,316 --> 00:35:37,432
-Sorry I didn't go.
-You didn't miss much.

402
00:35:37,596 --> 00:35:40,508
Except for some crazy woman
attacking Dorothy's boyfriend.

403
00:35:40,716 --> 00:35:42,229
And some reaIIy bad art.

404
00:35:42,396 --> 00:35:44,432
The stuff was basicaIIy porn.

405
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:45,790
Sounds okay.

406
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:51,634
Things have just been reaIIy weird IateIy.

407
00:35:51,836 --> 00:35:54,555
Today, I find this cupid mask
in the eIevator.

408
00:35:54,756 --> 00:35:58,192
I turn around and there's
my creepy neighbor Ieering at me.

409
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:01,109
''Don't be Iate, Kate.
You're first rate, Kate.'' Him?

410
00:36:01,276 --> 00:36:02,789
Yeah, him.

411
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:07,070
Every time I do Iaundry, he's there.
Day, night, it doesn't matter.

412
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:09,835
Knock it off.

413
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:12,511
Yesterday, my underwear was missing.

414
00:36:12,596 --> 00:36:14,314
Don't worry, that was me.

415
00:36:14,436 --> 00:36:16,870
I Iike to try them on, you know?

416
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:20,232
Makes me feeI free.
Tap into my, you know, feminine side.

417
00:36:20,436 --> 00:36:23,234
-What's it gonna be tonight?
-Can I have a Corona?

418
00:36:23,436 --> 00:36:25,108
Just a cIub soda, pIease.

419
00:36:25,836 --> 00:36:27,554
ActuaIIy, make that two.

420
00:36:30,676 --> 00:36:32,109
So...

421
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,709
...what do you say?

422
00:36:39,436 --> 00:36:41,996
I'm just asking you for a chance, that's aII.

423
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:44,434
I want to, Adam...

424
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:50,072
...but you drink, and you get
out of controI, and it scares me.

425
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:52,870
I've stopped. I've changed.

426
00:36:53,076 --> 00:36:55,544
So, it won't make a difference if you wait.

427
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:03,471
Right.

428
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:07,909
I don't get it. We toId you
we haven't seen SheIIey in over a year.

429
00:37:08,116 --> 00:37:10,505
-How are we gonna heIp you?
-Humor me.

430
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:13,312
Wasn't there another one of you?

431
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:14,511
LiIy.

432
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:16,195
She's out of town.

433
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:21,790
These are remembrance cards
sent to the parents.

434
00:37:21,996 --> 00:37:23,190
Look at this.

435
00:37:23,276 --> 00:37:24,789
It's odd.

436
00:37:31,036 --> 00:37:32,264
J.M.

437
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:39,746
-Jeremy MeIton, jeez.
-Who's Jeremy MeIton?

438
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,031
This Ioser from sixth grade.

439
00:37:42,236 --> 00:37:44,272
-He and SheIIey were friends?
-No.

440
00:37:44,356 --> 00:37:46,745
We haven't seen him in years.
Why wouId he send a card?

441
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:48,235
Because it's him.

442
00:37:49,396 --> 00:37:50,829
It's Jeremy.

443
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:53,951
I got an awfuI vaIentine the other day...

444
00:37:54,156 --> 00:37:56,465
...saying they were
gonna kiII me, signed ''J.M.''

445
00:37:56,676 --> 00:37:58,985
Ours, too. The card and our chocoIates.

446
00:37:59,876 --> 00:38:03,232
You both received threatening notes
signed ''J.M.''?

447
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:07,111
I say I'm Iooking for a Jason Marquette,
you don't mention it?

448
00:38:07,636 --> 00:38:09,228
I thought it was a joke.

449
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:10,715
Okay.

450
00:38:10,796 --> 00:38:12,354
Why wouId Jeremy want to hurt you?

451
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:16,435
He attacked me at a dance.
He got sent to reform schooI because of it.

452
00:38:16,596 --> 00:38:20,475
That expIains why he threatened you.
But why SheIIey? Why your friends?

453
00:38:20,916 --> 00:38:23,714
-I don't know, but he is.
-You don't know that.

454
00:38:23,796 --> 00:38:26,151
Some kid that you teased
in the sixth grade...

455
00:38:26,356 --> 00:38:29,268
...is probabIy not worth
getting aII worked up over.

456
00:38:34,916 --> 00:38:36,907
But I'II go check it out anyway.

457
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:39,709
You do that.

458
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:44,308
-I'm next. I know I'm next.
-What are you taIking about?

459
00:38:44,396 --> 00:38:47,388
Because Jeremy got sent
to reform schooI because of me.

460
00:38:47,476 --> 00:38:49,387
Dorothy, he attacked you.

461
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:52,109
Dorothy.

462
00:38:54,996 --> 00:38:57,829
He did attack you, right?

463
00:38:59,356 --> 00:39:00,345
No.

464
00:39:00,756 --> 00:39:01,825
He didn't.

465
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:06,788
-I just said that he did.
-Why wouId you do that?

466
00:39:07,916 --> 00:39:10,032
You guys wouIdn't understand.

467
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:14,194
Do you remember
what I Iooked Iike back then?

468
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,069
You were bigger.

469
00:39:17,876 --> 00:39:19,434
You were big-boned.

470
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:23,431
-You were pIump.
-I was fat, okay?

471
00:39:23,516 --> 00:39:26,349
The onIy guy that Iooked at me
that night was Jeremy.

472
00:39:26,516 --> 00:39:28,984
And when those guys came up
and saw us making out...

473
00:39:29,196 --> 00:39:31,312
...I couIdn't bear it and so...

474
00:39:32,076 --> 00:39:33,475
...I Iied.

475
00:39:33,676 --> 00:39:35,553
And I said he attacked me.

476
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:38,635
Why didn't you say something about this
to Vaughn?

477
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:40,395
I just couIdn't.

478
00:39:41,236 --> 00:39:44,069
Dorothy, I reaIIy wouIdn't worry about this.

479
00:39:44,276 --> 00:39:47,791
Jeremy MeIton couIdn't manage
a water fountain without screwing up.

480
00:39:47,956 --> 00:39:51,312
I don't think he's capabIe
of an intricate revenge pIot.

481
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:16,826
You scared me! What are you doing here?

482
00:40:17,036 --> 00:40:19,470
-I thought we were having dinner.
-We are?

483
00:40:20,756 --> 00:40:23,907
We are. I'm sorry. I compIeteIy forgot.

484
00:40:24,116 --> 00:40:26,072
I'm just a IittIe distracted.

485
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:27,425
What's up?

486
00:40:28,076 --> 00:40:30,112
It's probabIy nothing.

487
00:40:30,316 --> 00:40:32,671
You wouIdn't beIieve me if I toId you.

488
00:40:33,316 --> 00:40:34,908
You think it's far-fetched?

489
00:40:34,996 --> 00:40:38,306
This whoIe Jeremy MeIton
Revenge of the Nerds theory.

490
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:40,590
I don't know.

491
00:40:44,036 --> 00:40:45,185
What shouId I do?

492
00:40:45,396 --> 00:40:50,265
I'm thinking Mexico, the two of us,
untiI this aII bIows over.

493
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:54,350
WeII.

494
00:40:58,316 --> 00:41:00,352
-You want to come up?
-Yeah, I do.

495
00:41:00,556 --> 00:41:01,875
BeIieve me.

496
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:14,150
I do.

497
00:41:15,636 --> 00:41:16,785
But....

498
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:18,628
I don't want you to do something...

499
00:41:18,796 --> 00:41:21,754
...that you'll write off
as a weak moment tomorrow.

500
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:24,714
So get upstairs before l lose my will.

501
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:34,984
Don't worry about it, all right?

502
00:41:35,156 --> 00:41:37,226
Everything's gonna be all right.

503
00:41:43,156 --> 00:41:47,308
First, you guys get Melton
shipped off to reform school.

504
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:50,030
A year later, he lands in juvenile hall.

505
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:52,994
Six months after that,
a state-run mental hospital.

506
00:41:53,076 --> 00:41:54,555
That's awful.

507
00:41:54,796 --> 00:41:57,071
You must have done some number on him.

508
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:00,755
Where is he now?

509
00:42:00,876 --> 00:42:04,585
All we know is that his parents died
in a fire a couple years back.

510
00:42:04,676 --> 00:42:07,588
-Was he involved?
-l don't know. Ruled an accident.

511
00:42:07,796 --> 00:42:09,752
l want to show you something.

512
00:42:09,836 --> 00:42:13,192
l pulled a file photo,
and l ran some enhancements.

513
00:42:19,756 --> 00:42:21,109
Here we go.

514
00:42:21,476 --> 00:42:22,829
That's him.

515
00:42:22,996 --> 00:42:24,111
Right.

516
00:42:24,596 --> 00:42:26,791
But know anybody that looks like this?

517
00:42:27,476 --> 00:42:28,875
Or this?

518
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:30,955
Or this?

519
00:42:32,276 --> 00:42:33,345
Or this.

520
00:42:34,396 --> 00:42:36,307
Brown contacts, blue, green...

521
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:39,189
...beard, goatee, mustache?
Ten years is a long time.

522
00:42:39,396 --> 00:42:42,115
And there's the possibility
of plastic surgery.

523
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:44,391
Do you have more recent photos?

524
00:42:46,476 --> 00:42:48,751
Don't you think we'd be looking at them?

525
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:52,146
The point is, this could be anyone.
Where's your friend Lily?

526
00:42:52,356 --> 00:42:54,472
We told you. She's in L.A.

527
00:42:55,716 --> 00:42:57,832
What do you know about Max Raimi?

528
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:01,153
Just that he is an artist. A bad one.

529
00:43:02,836 --> 00:43:04,986
l know, l've seen his work.

530
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:08,190
What about the rest of you?
Any boyfriends?

531
00:43:08,436 --> 00:43:10,233
Paige, for example?

532
00:43:14,756 --> 00:43:17,224
The short answer is no.

533
00:43:19,276 --> 00:43:20,629
What about you?

534
00:43:22,116 --> 00:43:24,914
Sort of. But l've known him a while.

535
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:26,315
Meaning what?

536
00:43:26,436 --> 00:43:28,950
Meaning, we used to work
at the same paper.

537
00:43:29,036 --> 00:43:30,435
He covers the Giants.

538
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:35,271
His mother is a lawyer, his father
is a teacher. They're from Seattle.

539
00:43:35,756 --> 00:43:36,984
How's that?

540
00:43:39,396 --> 00:43:40,954
What about you?

541
00:43:41,196 --> 00:43:42,595
l have a boyfriend.

542
00:43:42,756 --> 00:43:45,714
But l can guarantee you
he's not Jeremy Melton.

543
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:49,712
-Why don't you let me decide?
-His name is Campbell.

544
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:53,944
And he's very smart.
He's starting his own lnternet venture.

545
00:43:54,116 --> 00:43:55,788
How long have you known him?

546
00:43:55,876 --> 00:43:58,470
-A month.
-Where did you meet him?

547
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:03,348
At yoga.
But it's a very exclusive gym, okay?

548
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,270
Wait.

549
00:44:06,636 --> 00:44:09,025
l thought Campbell is staying with you.

550
00:44:09,716 --> 00:44:10,944
Well, he is.

551
00:44:11,156 --> 00:44:13,670
His roommate didn't pay the rent, so....

552
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:18,108
Dorothy, you met this guy a month ago
and he's staying with you?

553
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:21,474
There have been guys
whose last names you didn't know...

554
00:44:21,676 --> 00:44:25,635
...that you let into your pants.
l'm just letting this guy into my house.

555
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:27,434
You don't have to be bitchy.

556
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:28,751
Fine.

557
00:44:29,716 --> 00:44:32,628
So while we're on the topic, Dorothy...

558
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:34,872
...what is Campbell's last name?

559
00:44:41,076 --> 00:44:44,193
You know, that's it. This is bullshit.

560
00:44:44,356 --> 00:44:46,916
l don't have to answer these questions.

561
00:44:47,396 --> 00:44:49,068
l'll see you guys later.

562
00:44:54,276 --> 00:44:55,789
That went well.

563
00:44:57,836 --> 00:45:00,270
-l got to go.
-Me, too.

564
00:45:01,316 --> 00:45:04,308
Paige, actually,
l'd like you to stay a moment.

565
00:45:04,676 --> 00:45:07,144
Am l in trouble, detective?

566
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:10,746
-You want to interrogate me?
-lt will just take a second.

567
00:45:12,236 --> 00:45:14,875
-Talk later?
-Sure, if l'm not under arrest.

568
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:24,195
Please take a seat.

569
00:45:35,236 --> 00:45:37,272
So, what are we gonna do about this?

570
00:45:37,476 --> 00:45:41,515
l thought that was your job.
You're the detective, right?

571
00:45:41,596 --> 00:45:43,552
l'm not talking about the case.

572
00:45:43,636 --> 00:45:46,787
Don't be coy. l'm talking about this.

573
00:45:47,916 --> 00:45:48,905
This?

574
00:45:49,116 --> 00:45:50,390
Tension.

575
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:52,029
The tension?

576
00:45:55,116 --> 00:45:57,346
The sexual tension.

577
00:45:58,196 --> 00:45:59,709
Let's be frank.

578
00:46:02,756 --> 00:46:07,227
Detective Vaughn,
please remove your hand from my thigh.

579
00:46:08,436 --> 00:46:11,553
All right.
Where would you like me to put it?

580
00:46:12,236 --> 00:46:14,192
How about up your ass?

581
00:46:15,716 --> 00:46:17,195
Have a good day.

582
00:46:23,516 --> 00:46:25,746
So, you'll get back to me on that?

583
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:51,314
Who the fuck are you?

584
00:46:54,636 --> 00:46:57,025
lt's not what it looks like, brother.

585
00:46:57,396 --> 00:46:59,671
Take it easy. l am not well.

586
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,269
Here you go.

587
00:47:27,876 --> 00:47:29,673
Happy Valentine's Day.

588
00:47:29,756 --> 00:47:32,589
-Happy Valentine's Day.
-l came by to drop off a gift.

589
00:47:32,796 --> 00:47:35,993
l'd have been here earlier,
but l was with that detective.

590
00:47:36,596 --> 00:47:38,587
lt was very romantic, actually.

591
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:40,951
-l wanted to explain.
-Nothing to explain.

592
00:47:41,156 --> 00:47:45,195
-He's talking to everybody.
-Kate, don't worry about it.

593
00:47:45,396 --> 00:47:48,115
Do you need a date
for Dorothy's party tonight?

594
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:51,594
You don't want to go
to a Valentine's party alone.

595
00:47:52,356 --> 00:47:53,709
True.

596
00:47:54,836 --> 00:47:56,428
So where's my gift?

597
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:04,034
l picked it out myself.

598
00:48:04,236 --> 00:48:05,954
lt's very cute.

599
00:48:06,756 --> 00:48:08,553
l got you something, too.

600
00:48:13,396 --> 00:48:15,785
-You got my suit cleaned.
-Turn around.

601
00:48:23,476 --> 00:48:25,706
''lOU TLC''

602
00:48:25,796 --> 00:48:27,787
This is outstanding.

603
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:31,153
-l love that.
-Can't get that at the mall.

604
00:48:31,316 --> 00:48:32,590
Nope.

605
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:37,310
'Bye.

606
00:49:08,156 --> 00:49:11,626
-What the hell are you doing?
-What are you doing here?

607
00:49:11,836 --> 00:49:14,873
Detective Vaughn is a disgusting,
lecherous scumbag.

608
00:49:15,076 --> 00:49:18,273
-What happened?
-After you left he put his hand on my thigh.

609
00:49:18,596 --> 00:49:21,474
-Did you ask him to?
-What do you think?

610
00:49:22,036 --> 00:49:23,355
l don't know.

611
00:49:26,596 --> 00:49:28,348
-Hello?
-lt's Dorothy.

612
00:49:28,556 --> 00:49:31,275
Hold on, Dorothy. Paige is here, too.

613
00:49:33,356 --> 00:49:34,709
Hey, Dorothy.

614
00:49:34,916 --> 00:49:37,635
Kate nearly clubbed me
on the head with an iron.

615
00:49:37,836 --> 00:49:39,633
They came for Campbell.

616
00:49:39,836 --> 00:49:41,747
l know. They questioned Adam, too.

617
00:49:41,956 --> 00:49:45,551
Did they call Adam
or did they question him for two hours?

618
00:49:45,716 --> 00:49:48,913
They've requested that Campbell
not leave town for a few days.

619
00:49:49,116 --> 00:49:50,708
lt's humiliating.

620
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:53,668
Did you give Vaughn his name?

621
00:49:53,756 --> 00:49:54,711
No!

622
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:56,634
Then how did he get it?

623
00:49:56,836 --> 00:49:58,474
He's a detective.

624
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:02,630
You go back and forth about Adam.
''Should l or shouldn't l?''

625
00:50:02,836 --> 00:50:04,554
Campbell is all l've got.

626
00:50:04,756 --> 00:50:06,986
l don't want to be dumped
before my party.

627
00:50:07,156 --> 00:50:11,195
Just hang up the phone
and make it up to the guy if he's so upset.

628
00:50:11,396 --> 00:50:12,795
What do you mean?

629
00:50:13,756 --> 00:50:15,747
Use your imagination.

630
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,110
-Thanks, Paige.
-You're welcome.

631
00:50:21,836 --> 00:50:24,191
She's so ridiculous.

632
00:50:24,796 --> 00:50:28,789
-Do you need instructions?
-lt's Detective Vaughn, Kate.

633
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:33,595
Sorry, detective.

634
00:50:33,676 --> 00:50:36,634
Good news. We picked up Marquette.

635
00:50:36,716 --> 00:50:39,947
-Does this mean that it's Jeremy?
-We haven't questioned him yet.

636
00:50:40,156 --> 00:50:42,386
But if it isn't Melton, you'll keep looking?

637
00:50:42,596 --> 00:50:45,986
We'll keep pursuing every angle.
Meantime, be careful.

638
00:50:46,196 --> 00:50:49,905
Stay with your friends.
l'll let you know when l have more.

639
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:51,509
Thank you, detective.

640
00:50:53,756 --> 00:50:54,984
Well?

641
00:50:55,676 --> 00:50:57,109
Picked up Marquette.

642
00:51:03,390 --> 00:51:05,381
What do we have here?

643
00:51:05,950 --> 00:51:08,669
Plan is to have this
up and running by tonight.

644
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:14,705
l'm sorry about this morning.

645
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:18,305
Don't even worry about it, really.
lt's not a big deal.

646
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,182
Happy Valentine's Day.

647
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:26,068
Dorothy, what--

648
00:51:27,070 --> 00:51:29,584
l had no idea we were exchanging.

649
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,503
l'm embarrassed. Do l open it?

650
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,264
Put it on.

651
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,103
You like it?

652
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:47,942
Do l like it?

653
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:51,185
-l love it.
-Yeah?

654
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:21,541
Don't worry about it.

655
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:23,542
lt's just that--

656
00:52:29,310 --> 00:52:31,221
l'm gonna go take a shower.

657
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,543
Now it's my turn.

658
00:52:52,990 --> 00:52:54,867
lt's so beautiful.

659
00:52:58,590 --> 00:53:00,023
Thank you.

660
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:03,385
Listen, l have that investor meeting--

661
00:53:03,550 --> 00:53:07,338
-You're leaving?
-Just for drinks. lt'll be an hour, tops.

662
00:53:07,510 --> 00:53:09,466
You have the militant Millicent here.

663
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,788
She's got her army of caterers
and workmen so you'll be just fine.

664
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,140
Yeah, l guess.

665
00:53:17,710 --> 00:53:19,109
Well...

666
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,181
...do you care to join me now?

667
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,423
Tempting, tempting...

668
00:53:25,630 --> 00:53:27,985
...but l want to work out
before my meeting.

669
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:32,383
But l promise you l'll be back
for the party, okay?

670
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:49,420
Evan Wheeler.
Account number 3-1-6-5-9-3-6.

671
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:52,468
Look, we've been over this
three times already.

672
00:53:52,950 --> 00:53:55,510
And l realize it's the entire account.

673
00:53:56,870 --> 00:54:00,021
February 16, 1940.

674
00:54:00,230 --> 00:54:03,142
Mother's maiden name? Sather.

675
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:05,022
Any other questions?

676
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,308
San Francisco.

677
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,544
What's that?

678
00:54:14,070 --> 00:54:18,109
Don't tell me where the fuck l was born.
Just transfer the damn funds!

679
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:19,943
Campbell?

680
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,463
Campbell?

681
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:27,829
Yes, Dorothy?

682
00:54:28,350 --> 00:54:30,181
We lost the hot water in the main house.

683
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:33,905
Could you do me a favor
and relight the pilot in the basement?

684
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:38,020
Sure, that's no problem.

685
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:41,264
Fucking perfect. Now l'm on the staff.

686
00:54:54,470 --> 00:54:55,823
Perfect.

687
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:26,704
Great.

688
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,144
Damn it!

689
00:55:36,110 --> 00:55:37,623
Fucking perfect.

690
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,061
Shoot.

691
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,343
Yeah.

692
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:25,019
l think that's worth at least a Porsche.

693
00:56:29,910 --> 00:56:31,184
Shit!

694
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,341
There you are. Excuse me.

695
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,149
There you are.

696
00:57:01,070 --> 00:57:04,904
-Any luck finding a date tonight?
-l'm playing phone tag with Brian.

697
00:57:05,070 --> 00:57:06,742
-Who?
-Brian.

698
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:09,510
-Remember the guy from Turbo Dating?
-Right.

699
00:57:09,870 --> 00:57:12,987
-l'm gonna go look around.
-Okay. Have fun.

700
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:27,422
Still no Campbell?

701
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,224
Nope.

702
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:31,586
Well, it's only...

703
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,184
...1 1 :00.

704
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:36,303
He said he'd be here before the party.

705
00:57:38,070 --> 00:57:41,460
l'm not an idiot, Kate.
l know when l'm being dumped.

706
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,104
-You're not getting dumped.
-Right.

707
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:47,262
-Happy Valentine's Day, ladies.
-Hey, Adam.

708
00:57:50,110 --> 00:57:51,668
-You look great.
-So do you.

709
00:57:51,870 --> 00:57:53,747
Yeah, you look great.

710
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:56,510
-Nice party, Dorothy.
-lt blows.

711
00:57:57,830 --> 00:57:59,229
Everything okay?

712
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:02,979
Yeah, everything is fine.
lt's just that men suck.

713
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:05,665
That's no offense to you, Adam.

714
00:58:06,310 --> 00:58:07,629
None taken.

715
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:13,623
Okay. Excuse me.

716
00:58:15,310 --> 00:58:17,619
He'll get here, Dorth. Don't worry.

717
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,269
Don't ask.

718
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,707
Are you doing anything later on?

719
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:30,622
Actually, l'm busy.

720
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,827
l'm gonna hook up with a young stud.
Get a little action.

721
00:58:33,990 --> 00:58:36,663
Really? Sounds good. Anyone l know?

722
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:39,065
l'm young, reasonably good-looking.

723
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:42,501
lt shouldn't be that
difficult finding volunteers.

724
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,383
Yeah, you'll do.

725
00:59:06,790 --> 00:59:08,109
Hey, hot stuff.

726
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:10,499
You came.

727
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,148
l like how you move.

728
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:16,142
Why don't you join me?

729
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:28,944
You know...

730
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,664
...l'd much rather take you upstairs.

731
00:59:42,310 --> 00:59:44,062
What's upstairs?

732
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,421
Something l want to show you.

733
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:49,982
lt's a surprise.

734
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:53,980
l love surprises.

735
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:16,539
So....

736
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,144
So?

737
01:00:21,670 --> 01:00:23,422
We're upstairs now.

738
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,303
Yes, we are.

739
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:28,541
You had a surprise for me?

740
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:37,982
Yes, l do.

741
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:52,699
Surprise.

742
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:59,069
You brought me up here
to show me your penis.

743
01:01:00,190 --> 01:01:02,420
That's so sweet.

744
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:08,664
Well?

745
01:01:12,350 --> 01:01:14,420
What are you waiting for, honey?

746
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:15,859
Wax it!

747
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:20,189
-You're unbelievable.
-Paige.

748
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,903
Relax, okay?

749
01:01:23,230 --> 01:01:24,663
lt'll be fun.

750
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:29,784
All right.

751
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,182
Take off your shirt.

752
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:33,938
All right.

753
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,508
Don't forget your pants.

754
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,909
Now lay down.

755
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,223
What are you doing?

756
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:16,339
Never mind. lt's a surprise.

757
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,389
l knew it.

758
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:33,818
Knew what?

759
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,460
First time l saw you,
l knew you were kinky, Paige.

760
01:02:44,190 --> 01:02:46,420
You still want me to wax it?

761
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:48,422
Yes, l do.

762
01:03:03,590 --> 01:03:06,309
God, Paige! Bitch!

763
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:15,423
This party sucks.

764
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:17,820
Things didn't go well with Brian?

765
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:20,224
Oh, my God.

766
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:27,822
-This is a private party.
-Get your little paws off me.

767
01:03:27,910 --> 01:03:31,539
-What is she doing here?
-She was just leaving, Dorothy.

768
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,584
That's my necklace!

769
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,980
What? Campbell gave this to me.

770
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,789
And what are you supposed to be?
His valentine?

771
01:03:38,990 --> 01:03:42,062
l don't think so, sweetie.
That necklace was stolen!

772
01:03:42,230 --> 01:03:44,903
Along with half the rest of my jewelry.

773
01:03:45,710 --> 01:03:47,587
Hurts, doesn't it?

774
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:50,468
He loves me.

775
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:54,300
He loves your trust fund.

776
01:03:55,830 --> 01:03:58,219
-Trust me.
-Time to go.

777
01:03:58,390 --> 01:03:59,584
Watch the jacket!

778
01:04:07,990 --> 01:04:10,220
Now this party officially sucks.

779
01:04:10,390 --> 01:04:11,948
No kidding.

780
01:04:14,190 --> 01:04:15,669
Where are you going?

781
01:04:15,750 --> 01:04:17,069
To chill out.

782
01:04:22,510 --> 01:04:23,989
Hello again.

783
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:30,143
Wait a minute.
Where are you running off to?

784
01:04:30,350 --> 01:04:32,068
What do you want, Max?

785
01:04:32,150 --> 01:04:33,947
Easy, sweetness.

786
01:04:34,150 --> 01:04:36,380
l wanted to know if you've seen Lily.

787
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:39,343
She's in L.A.
And don't call me ''sweetness.''

788
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:42,258
Well, sweetness, Lily is not in L.A.

789
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:45,107
What are you talking about?

790
01:04:45,870 --> 01:04:48,942
l called her office,
and they said she never showed up.

791
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,029
Are you sure?

792
01:04:51,190 --> 01:04:52,305
About what?

793
01:04:52,590 --> 01:04:54,865
Hello. Max, about Lily.

794
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:57,581
How long have you known this?

795
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:01,902
You're really at home in this outfit, girl.

796
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,784
You just look yum.

797
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:33,939
Great.

798
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,861
What are you supposed to be?

799
01:06:45,430 --> 01:06:46,749
l was just....

800
01:09:53,910 --> 01:09:54,945
Dorothy?

801
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:58,824
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

802
01:09:59,190 --> 01:10:03,547
Listen. That Max guy said that Lily
never showed up in L.A.

803
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:05,866
Have you heard anything from her?

804
01:10:06,470 --> 01:10:07,585
No.

805
01:10:09,030 --> 01:10:10,702
But l bet Paige has.

806
01:10:13,030 --> 01:10:14,668
-Do you think he's here?
-Who?

807
01:10:14,870 --> 01:10:16,861
-Jeremy Melton.
-God, l hope not.

808
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,305
My dad's got a gun in his study.

809
01:10:19,510 --> 01:10:21,978
That's a good way to get us both killed.

810
01:10:28,070 --> 01:10:28,980
Hello?

811
01:10:29,190 --> 01:10:32,182
lt's Detective Vaughn.
We had to let Marquette go.

812
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:33,498
What do you mean?

813
01:10:33,590 --> 01:10:35,899
We didn't have enough evidence
to hold him.

814
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:38,419
He could be anywhere, like your party.

815
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:40,541
What? What happened?

816
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:44,067
Listen, our friend Lily
never showed up in L.A.

817
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:46,619
Stay put, stay in groups, l'm on my way.

818
01:10:51,510 --> 01:10:53,740
They had to let Marquette go.

819
01:10:53,830 --> 01:10:55,661
So now they've got nothing?

820
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,944
Come on.

821
01:11:07,190 --> 01:11:09,579
Which one of the Twelve Steps is this?

822
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:10,739
Kate!

823
01:11:10,830 --> 01:11:14,220
There you are.
l've been looking all over for you.

824
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:17,620
l wasn't at the bottom of a bottle?

825
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:28,186
Kate!

826
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,664
Don't be mad! lt's Valentine's Day.

827
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:34,263
Get away from me.

828
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,379
Hello?

829
01:13:20,470 --> 01:13:21,619
Hello?

830
01:13:23,990 --> 01:13:26,504
Does someone want to be my valentine?

831
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:30,224
Come on.

832
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:38,945
Hello?

833
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:43,979
Come on.

834
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:49,943
Come on.

835
01:13:56,110 --> 01:13:57,429
Brian?

836
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,506
All right, get the fuck out.

837
01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,461
Get off of me!

838
01:14:38,550 --> 01:14:40,461
Stop it! Stop!

839
01:15:55,910 --> 01:15:57,741
-Kate!
-Yeah?

840
01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,942
Shit, we blew a fuse.

841
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:03,707
Come on. Grab Stephanie. Let's go.

842
01:16:07,670 --> 01:16:09,740
Jesus, this place cleared out fast.

843
01:16:09,950 --> 01:16:11,269
Where is Paige?

844
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:15,787
Probably in the hot tub. She always
ends up in the hot tub at parties.

845
01:16:16,190 --> 01:16:19,307
-Where's Adam?
-Did you check the wine cellar?

846
01:16:20,950 --> 01:16:23,828
-Could be him, you know.
-What could be him?

847
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:31,663
-Come on, Dorothy.
-No, don't ''come on, Dorothy'' me.

848
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,708
Why the hell not?

849
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:36,665
Because l know Adam.

850
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:40,818
He's no angel, but he's not a murderer.

851
01:16:40,910 --> 01:16:44,585
You didn't know he was an alcoholic
when you first met him either.

852
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:47,945
l don't know if l trust your judgment.

853
01:16:48,030 --> 01:16:49,543
That's enough!

854
01:16:49,630 --> 01:16:52,906
Come on! With a little working out
and some plastic surgery...

855
01:16:52,990 --> 01:16:56,266
...why couldn't Jeremy Melton
become Adam Carr?

856
01:16:56,750 --> 01:17:00,106
Then by the same logic,
why couldn't Jeremy Melton be Campbell?

857
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:01,145
You...

858
01:17:03,310 --> 01:17:05,346
...should take that back.

859
01:17:07,230 --> 01:17:09,061
Look, Dorothy.

860
01:17:09,470 --> 01:17:13,668
l'm not saying it's true. l'm saying
if we're gonna be pointing fingers....

861
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:16,742
l mean, you heard
what that Ruthie woman said.

862
01:17:16,830 --> 01:17:18,980
How well do you really know Campbell?

863
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:22,460
You don't even know his last name,
for God's sake.

864
01:17:24,910 --> 01:17:28,186
-You really can't stand it, can you?
-Can't stand what?

865
01:17:28,270 --> 01:17:31,467
That l found someone just as good
as your boyfriend.

866
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:35,145
Just as smart and just as good-looking.

867
01:17:35,230 --> 01:17:37,539
-That's ridiculous.
-l mean, why?

868
01:17:37,630 --> 01:17:41,259
Why should l, why should the fat girl,
get a turn?

869
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:43,945
-What?
-Come on, Kate!

870
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:47,227
You were always the popular one,
and Shelley was the brainy one...

871
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:51,025
...Lily was the fun one
and Paige was the sexy one, and l was...

872
01:17:51,230 --> 01:17:53,061
...the big, fat one.

873
01:17:53,830 --> 01:17:57,618
As far as you're concerned,
that's exactly the way that it is.

874
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,904
You know what?

875
01:18:00,270 --> 01:18:02,340
Screw all of you.

876
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:09,463
Come back!

877
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:11,624
Come on!

878
01:18:36,590 --> 01:18:38,660
Come on, Vaughn.

879
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:37,819
This is Detective Leon Vaughn, SFPD.
Leave a message.

880
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:36,985
Hi.

881
01:20:43,110 --> 01:20:44,304
lt's you.

882
01:20:45,950 --> 01:20:48,510
-lt's me.
-You're still here.

883
01:20:49,830 --> 01:20:51,263
Still here.

884
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:55,659
l heard a noise.
l thought something happened to Dorothy.

885
01:20:57,190 --> 01:20:59,181
Dorothy's a big girl.

886
01:21:00,990 --> 01:21:02,503
What do you mean?

887
01:21:02,710 --> 01:21:04,462
Dance with me, Kate.

888
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:08,060
-l just want to find Dorothy.
-l'm asking you nicely.

889
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:10,463
Dance with me.

890
01:21:18,070 --> 01:21:19,867
Don't make me beg.

891
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:22,149
Please.

892
01:21:32,670 --> 01:21:34,228
l screwed up.

893
01:21:36,510 --> 01:21:39,343
You had a few drinks.
lt's not the end of the world.

894
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,625
No, you're disappointed.

895
01:21:43,510 --> 01:21:46,149
l'm just worried that you'll hurt me.

896
01:21:46,550 --> 01:21:47,778
Hurt you?

897
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:49,909
Hurt you?

898
01:21:50,190 --> 01:21:52,829
No, baby, l love you.

899
01:21:54,350 --> 01:21:57,023
You're the only good thing in my life.

900
01:21:57,430 --> 01:22:00,979
All these other people,
they can just die as far as l care.

901
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,029
But you...

902
01:22:08,350 --> 01:22:10,545
...you mean something to me.

903
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:20,339
What's the matter? You're shaking.

904
01:22:21,590 --> 01:22:23,945
l don't want to hurt you either, Adam.

905
01:22:24,150 --> 01:22:25,629
l understand.

906
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:28,705
But l will.

907
01:22:52,150 --> 01:22:53,469
Hello.

908
01:23:01,710 --> 01:23:03,701
What the hell's going on?

909
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:04,984
Nothing.

910
01:23:06,870 --> 01:23:10,909
What happened back there,
l just want to talk about this.

911
01:23:12,350 --> 01:23:13,863
l'm sorry.

912
01:23:14,110 --> 01:23:17,182
l guess l was just a little upset
about the drinking.

913
01:23:17,270 --> 01:23:19,067
You were doing so well.

914
01:23:38,550 --> 01:23:40,620
Why do you want to hurt me?

915
01:23:41,430 --> 01:23:43,785
l love you. Always loved you.

916
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:49,144
-Stay away from me!
-Come on.

917
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:29,510
-Adam, l'm sorry.
-lt's all right.

918
01:26:30,030 --> 01:26:31,668
l'm so sorry!

919
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:34,219
All right. lt's over.

920
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:36,784
lt's over.

921
01:26:38,070 --> 01:26:40,106
-No, don't look!
-lt's all right.

922
01:26:59,830 --> 01:27:01,104
Dorothy!

923
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:19,462
Don't look at her.

924
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:40,268
lt's at the top of the street on the right,
please hurry.

925
01:27:48,990 --> 01:27:50,946
Police are on their way.

926
01:27:51,830 --> 01:27:53,548
l don't understand.

927
01:27:54,510 --> 01:27:57,149
A few weeks ago, she was so happy.

928
01:27:57,470 --> 01:27:59,745
Happier than l'd ever seen her.

929
01:28:01,870 --> 01:28:03,144
lt's okay.

930
01:28:06,910 --> 01:28:08,901
l just don't understand.

931
01:28:11,350 --> 01:28:14,626
All l can think is
when someone is that lonely...

932
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:17,508
...or that angry...

933
01:28:17,910 --> 01:28:20,140
...they can learn to hide it.

934
01:28:20,430 --> 01:28:22,660
But inside, it never dies.

935
01:28:22,990 --> 01:28:24,821
lt just stays there.

936
01:28:25,070 --> 01:28:26,742
Eats away at you.

937
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:30,621
Until one day
you have to do something about it.

938
01:28:31,350 --> 01:28:34,945
But we all liked her. We were her friends.

939
01:28:35,150 --> 01:28:37,789
Sometimes that's not enough, l guess.

940
01:28:41,630 --> 01:28:44,428
l am so sorry for the way l was before.

941
01:28:44,590 --> 01:28:46,581
None of that matters now.

942
01:28:47,790 --> 01:28:49,542
l love you, Adam.

943
01:28:49,870 --> 01:28:51,462
l love you, Kate.

944
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:57,862
l always have.
