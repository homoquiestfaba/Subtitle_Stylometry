1
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:13,818
(eerie music)

2
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:37,751
(lightning crackling)

3
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:43,951
(shuddered breathing)

4
00:00:56,951 --> 00:00:57,784
- [Man] Lucy.

5
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:00,051
(jangling)

6
00:01:07,751 --> 00:01:10,585
(thunder rolling)

7
00:01:29,818 --> 00:01:33,218
(dramatic chorale music)

8
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:50,851
- [Woman] Near the sea, up a long lane far from town,

9
00:01:50,851 --> 00:01:53,418
lies the house of one John Ambrose,

10
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:55,885
a haunted man.

11
00:01:57,652 --> 00:02:01,519
The house stands abandoned, left to Ambrose's ghost.

12
00:02:03,051 --> 00:02:05,185
Some say he was once in love with his demon

13
00:02:06,285 --> 00:02:08,485
and to this day he still revisits the house

14
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,318
to pay tribute.

15
00:02:10,418 --> 00:02:13,418
(carriage rattling)

16
00:03:01,352 --> 00:03:03,585
Nobody knows the whole story.

17
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:05,051
Some say the lady that lived here

18
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:06,418
died of a broken heart.

19
00:03:07,585 --> 00:03:09,051
Others say that her lover murdered her

20
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:10,684
in a violent rage after finding her

21
00:03:10,684 --> 00:03:11,885
in bed with another man.

22
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,418
But this much is certain.

23
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:15,651
- [Driver] Whoa!

24
00:03:15,651 --> 00:03:17,118
- [Woman] She blames him for her death.

25
00:03:19,352 --> 00:03:21,018
- This is what I wanted you to see.

26
00:03:21,018 --> 00:03:24,519
- Sarah, these old superstitions of yours, they--

27
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:25,584
- Help me down.

28
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:26,584
I want to go inside.

29
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:28,784
- Okay.

30
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:33,584
(horse nickering)

31
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:39,519
We might be a while.

32
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,751
(gate creaking)

33
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:41,885
What about the man who owns this house?

34
00:03:41,885 --> 00:03:43,152
- The place is abandoned.

35
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:46,152
The whole town's afraid to come near this place.

36
00:04:17,118 --> 00:04:18,418
Relax, James.

37
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:19,785
We're all alone.

38
00:04:19,785 --> 00:04:21,452
We could live here, James.

39
00:04:21,452 --> 00:04:22,485
Together.

40
00:04:22,485 --> 00:04:25,152
Nobody'd have to know.

41
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,385
Just us, alone.

42
00:04:28,051 --> 00:04:29,751
Let the rest of the world be damned.

43
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:32,818
- We'll move in tonight,

44
00:04:32,818 --> 00:04:34,818
right after I'm done with my studies.

45
00:04:34,818 --> 00:04:37,318
- Don't make fun of my dreams.

46
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:40,285
Mm.

47
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,951
(romantic orchestral music)

48
00:05:06,118 --> 00:05:09,418
(both laughing)

49
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:10,385
James?

50
00:05:10,385 --> 00:05:11,918
- [James] Hmm?

51
00:05:11,918 --> 00:05:13,985
- Have you told your father you want to study painting?

52
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:14,818
- No.

53
00:05:15,718 --> 00:05:17,785
It's out of the question.

54
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,751
I'm to be the third generation managing the flax mills.

55
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:23,851
Decided at birth.

56
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:28,185
- You ever think of telling your parents about me?

57
00:05:32,285 --> 00:05:33,352
- You know, I would.

58
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,985
I just couldn't possibly explain.

59
00:05:38,985 --> 00:05:40,584
- No, of course not.

60
00:05:42,152 --> 00:05:42,985
I'm sorry.

61
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,085
It was a stupid question.

62
00:05:46,085 --> 00:05:49,118
Almost as stupid as imagining we could live here together,

63
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:50,352
escape from the world.

64
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,252
I have bad news.

65
00:06:00,152 --> 00:06:01,518
I've missed my time.

66
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:04,718
- Dear God.

67
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,051
- I don't know what to do.

68
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:13,152
- Now, you mustn't worry.

69
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,385
I'll take care of you, Sarah.

70
00:06:20,252 --> 00:06:21,451
Everything will be fine.

71
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:26,951
- Goshen College, home for the young bon vivants

72
00:06:26,951 --> 00:06:29,352
of minor education.

73
00:06:29,352 --> 00:06:30,684
James, my good man.

74
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:32,584
- Fletcher.

75
00:06:32,584 --> 00:06:34,085
- Cards tonight in the commons?

76
00:06:34,085 --> 00:06:36,252
Jenkins and Graham are in, bring your father's wallet.

77
00:06:36,252 --> 00:06:37,285
- I can't tonight.

78
00:06:37,285 --> 00:06:38,551
- Oh!

79
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:40,484
Brandy and cigars are in the offing.

80
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,252
A good time shall be had by all.

81
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,985
- I have a prior engagement.

82
00:06:44,985 --> 00:06:46,818
Give my regrets to the boys.

83
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:48,751
- Drinking watered down beer with

84
00:06:48,751 --> 00:06:50,651
overripe fishermen in Portsmouth.

85
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:52,318
When are we going to stop being ashamed

86
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:53,918
of our higher social standing?

87
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:56,218
Will you slow down?

88
00:06:56,218 --> 00:06:58,152
You look as if your trousers have caught fire!

89
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,384
- There is a lady expecting me.

90
00:07:00,384 --> 00:07:04,885
- God's eternal source of spontaneous combustion. (laughs)

91
00:07:04,885 --> 00:07:06,651
- Perhaps you'd...

92
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:08,218
You're a man of the world.

93
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:10,318
- Why do I get the feeling I shall have to

94
00:07:10,318 --> 00:07:11,584
pay for this compliment?

95
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:15,118
- I need a referral.

96
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:19,551
(lighting crackling)

97
00:07:20,451 --> 00:07:21,718
- [Driver] Hey-ah!

98
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:25,051
Hey-ah! (horse clopping)

99
00:07:26,118 --> 00:07:26,951
- James.

100
00:07:28,518 --> 00:07:29,451
James!

101
00:07:29,451 --> 00:07:30,551
- Hmm?

102
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:31,384
- Look at me.

103
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,451
I'm scared.

104
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:46,384
Don't leave me, James.

105
00:07:47,252 --> 00:07:48,085
Promise.

106
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:51,718
- I promise.

107
00:08:00,584 --> 00:08:01,785
Uh, wait here.

108
00:08:01,785 --> 00:08:04,185
- Yes, sir.

109
00:08:04,185 --> 00:08:05,684
- Don't worry, Sarah.

110
00:08:05,684 --> 00:08:10,684
Everything's gonna be all right. (clears throat)

111
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:14,651
(dog barking nearby)

112
00:08:15,684 --> 00:08:18,451
(dramatic music)

113
00:08:25,118 --> 00:08:27,384
(knocking)

114
00:08:36,651 --> 00:08:37,484
Mr. Tilton?

115
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,185
- You can call me Dr. Tilton if it makes you feel better.

116
00:08:43,818 --> 00:08:45,918
You're a nice looking couple.

117
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,718
Don't get married. (chuckles)

118
00:08:47,718 --> 00:08:49,252
Ten dollars in advance.

119
00:08:50,252 --> 00:08:52,051
- (scoffs) Ten dollars?

120
00:08:52,051 --> 00:08:54,118
- End of the month, landlord's raising the rent,

121
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:55,317
the godless bastard.

122
00:09:01,218 --> 00:09:02,051
Drink this.

123
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,185
Go ahead.

124
00:09:14,152 --> 00:09:16,152
(Sarah gulps)

125
00:09:16,152 --> 00:09:17,051
Won't take long.

126
00:09:17,051 --> 00:09:17,918
You wait here.

127
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:22,218
- (stammering) I'll be right here.

128
00:09:24,451 --> 00:09:25,718
Be brave.

129
00:09:25,718 --> 00:09:28,152
(door slams)

130
00:09:37,351 --> 00:09:39,618
(horse neighing)

131
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,451
(thunder rolling)

132
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,217
- [Tilton] On the table, there, miss.

133
00:09:47,217 --> 00:09:48,651
Up you go.

134
00:09:48,651 --> 00:09:51,684
It will all be over soon now.

135
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:54,818
(eerie music)

136
00:09:54,818 --> 00:09:58,217
(Sarah screaming inside)

137
00:10:08,918 --> 00:10:09,718
- Sarah?

138
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:12,251
- Just the laudanum.

139
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:13,085
- Laudanum?

140
00:10:13,085 --> 00:10:14,351
You don't have ether?

141
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:16,317
- You have no idea how much it costs

142
00:10:16,317 --> 00:10:17,751
to ship that up from Boston.

143
00:10:20,018 --> 00:10:22,518
Relax, bit of rest, she'll be right as rain.

144
00:10:22,518 --> 00:10:24,152
Up to her old tricks in no time.

145
00:10:24,152 --> 00:10:26,085
- [Sarah] James.

146
00:10:26,085 --> 00:10:27,651
- Calm yourself, Sarah.

147
00:10:27,651 --> 00:10:28,484
I've got you.

148
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:36,351
Come on, shh, shh.

149
00:10:36,351 --> 00:10:38,918
(Sarah crying)

150
00:10:40,785 --> 00:10:41,618
Go.

151
00:10:41,618 --> 00:10:42,451
Go!

152
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:43,384
Go, driver!

153
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:46,251
(horse clopping)

154
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:47,818
(dramatic music)

155
00:10:47,818 --> 00:10:50,551
(Sarah groaning)

156
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:54,251
Look at you.

157
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,184
Dear God.

158
00:10:55,184 --> 00:10:57,085
Faster, driver, faster!

159
00:10:58,484 --> 00:11:00,018
It'll be okay, it's all right.

160
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,284
Be strong, we'll be back to,

161
00:11:01,284 --> 00:11:02,251
we'll be back to your room soon.

162
00:11:02,251 --> 00:11:04,051
Everything'll be all right.

163
00:11:04,051 --> 00:11:05,451
Okay.

164
00:11:05,451 --> 00:11:06,284
Oh my God.

165
00:11:07,384 --> 00:11:09,251
Faster, faster!

166
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:12,251
(suspenseful music)

167
00:11:33,885 --> 00:11:36,484
(James grunts)

168
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:44,518
(door crashing)

169
00:11:45,684 --> 00:11:46,651
Okay, there.

170
00:11:47,951 --> 00:11:49,251
Here, all right.

171
00:11:51,117 --> 00:11:52,051
Shh, shh, okay, okay.

172
00:11:52,051 --> 00:11:54,951
(Sarah shuddering)

173
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,117
(paper rustling)

174
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:58,951
(match striking)

175
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:00,317
Shh, shh, shh.

176
00:12:00,317 --> 00:12:01,117
- [Sarah] I'm cold.

177
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:01,951
- I know, I know.

178
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:03,417
I know.

179
00:12:03,417 --> 00:12:04,918
I know, I know.

180
00:12:04,918 --> 00:12:06,084
Okay.

181
00:12:06,084 --> 00:12:07,417
Okay.

182
00:12:07,417 --> 00:12:08,251
I must go for help.

183
00:12:08,251 --> 00:12:09,084
- No!

184
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,051
- No, that's--

185
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:10,885
- No!

186
00:12:10,885 --> 00:12:11,785
- I... - No.

187
00:12:11,785 --> 00:12:12,618
- Just, just...

188
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:14,784
Someone will...

189
00:12:15,784 --> 00:12:17,417
I will come back, okay?

190
00:12:17,417 --> 00:12:18,851
I will come back.

191
00:12:18,851 --> 00:12:19,751
- No. - All right?

192
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:20,584
- No!

193
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:22,217
- Hold on, okay?

194
00:12:22,217 --> 00:12:24,384
- Please don't go, please.

195
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:25,885
James.

196
00:12:25,885 --> 00:12:26,718
You promised you wouldn't--

197
00:12:26,718 --> 00:12:27,584
- I will come back.

198
00:12:28,417 --> 00:12:29,351
- James!

199
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,284
James!

200
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:34,384
James.

201
00:12:35,484 --> 00:12:36,317
James.

202
00:12:38,518 --> 00:12:39,351
James.

203
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:40,684
- I'll come back.

204
00:12:40,684 --> 00:12:41,518
I promise.

205
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:52,584
(Sarah crying)

206
00:12:52,584 --> 00:12:55,384
(thunder rolling)

207
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:03,351
(crowd chattering)

208
00:13:10,417 --> 00:13:11,584
Barkeep.

209
00:13:11,584 --> 00:13:12,584
- Wait your turn, kid.

210
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:14,417
Next?

211
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:17,117
- Ah! (laughing)

212
00:13:17,117 --> 00:13:19,518
Never! (laughing)

213
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,384
- I heard a cry upstairs.

214
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:22,751
I think there's a...

215
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:23,885
I think there's a girl in trouble.

216
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:25,217
- What?

217
00:13:25,217 --> 00:13:26,484
- Yeah, a girl, she needs help.

218
00:13:26,484 --> 00:13:28,951
Somebody had best look in on her.

219
00:13:28,951 --> 00:13:30,351
- [Barkeep] Uh, in a minute.

220
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,751
I'll see to it in a minute, do you want a drink?

221
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,984
- No.

222
00:13:32,984 --> 00:13:36,818
(patrons laughing and chattering)

223
00:13:39,551 --> 00:13:40,784
But you'll go to her?

224
00:13:40,784 --> 00:13:42,718
- I said I will in a minute, okay?

225
00:13:42,718 --> 00:13:44,818
- But you will go to her?

226
00:13:44,818 --> 00:13:48,084
- [Barkeep] Is there an echo in here?

227
00:13:48,084 --> 00:13:48,918
Next.

228
00:13:56,417 --> 00:13:58,317
- [James] Excuse me.

229
00:13:58,317 --> 00:14:00,851
(rain falling)

230
00:14:14,017 --> 00:14:16,950
(Sarah crying out)

231
00:14:39,618 --> 00:14:42,384
(blood dripping)

232
00:14:44,117 --> 00:14:47,117
(whispering) Sarah.

233
00:14:48,551 --> 00:14:49,384
- [Sarah] (shouting) No!

234
00:14:49,384 --> 00:14:52,718
- (whispering) Sarah...

235
00:14:53,885 --> 00:14:55,217
- [Sarah] We could live here James.

236
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:56,484
Let the rest of the world be damned.

237
00:14:56,484 --> 00:14:58,618
(Sarah screaming)

238
00:14:58,618 --> 00:15:01,618
(breathing heavily)

239
00:15:15,217 --> 00:15:16,050
- James.

240
00:15:19,417 --> 00:15:20,384
James, are you ill?

241
00:15:21,684 --> 00:15:22,518
- No, I'm fine.

242
00:15:22,518 --> 00:15:23,417
- Oh, fine!

243
00:15:24,351 --> 00:15:25,950
James, please talk to me.

244
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,117
I'm your friend.

245
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:31,718
(water splashing)

246
00:15:31,718 --> 00:15:32,584
Did you...

247
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,584
Um-- - False alarm.

248
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:39,184
- [Fletcher] All the same, you really don't look well.

249
00:15:39,184 --> 00:15:41,351
You know, I know a fantastic spot in Connecticut,

250
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,284
they have these mineral baths.

251
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:46,718
I swear they'll soothe you a hundred times over.

252
00:15:46,718 --> 00:15:49,984
- Uh, Fletcher, I'm fine.

253
00:15:49,984 --> 00:15:51,584
(clears throat) Thank you.

254
00:15:52,784 --> 00:15:53,950
- [Fletcher] Very well.

255
00:15:55,818 --> 00:15:57,084
I'm going to see what horrors

256
00:15:57,084 --> 00:15:59,184
they've cooked up for our breakfast.

257
00:16:06,017 --> 00:16:08,518
(James sighs)

258
00:16:10,917 --> 00:16:14,817
(marketplace crowd chattering)

259
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,050
- Excuse me.

260
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,884
Uh, how much for the flowers?

261
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:27,618
- Penny a bunch, sir.

262
00:16:27,618 --> 00:16:28,551
- I'll take them.

263
00:16:28,551 --> 00:16:29,351
All right, there you are.

264
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:30,484
- Thank you, sir.

265
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:31,484
- Thank you.

266
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,451
(horse whinnying nearby)

267
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:38,384
(crowd chattering)

268
00:16:41,017 --> 00:16:43,618
(bell tolling)

269
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:50,484
- [Fisherman] It was me she had the warm welcome for.

270
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:54,651
- [Fisherman] Whitehall, you never laid down with a woman...

271
00:16:54,651 --> 00:16:56,817
- Aye, many a time, many a time!

272
00:16:56,817 --> 00:16:58,151
- Why is everybody outside?

273
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:01,751
- Arr, they gave us all the boot.

274
00:17:01,751 --> 00:17:04,184
Found a corpse upstairs.

275
00:17:04,184 --> 00:17:05,451
- Ah, easy, lad.

276
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:07,050
'Twas only one of the local wenches.

277
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,584
And sure, isn't the first time

278
00:17:08,584 --> 00:17:13,384
an unhappy customer gave one of them the knife. (laughs)

279
00:17:13,384 --> 00:17:16,317
(melancholy music)

280
00:17:20,684 --> 00:17:22,417
- Leave on, leave on!

281
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:27,884
- Nah! (scoffs)

282
00:18:16,618 --> 00:18:19,384
(dramatic music)

283
00:18:33,783 --> 00:18:36,518
(horse whinnies)

284
00:18:41,151 --> 00:18:41,984
- Yeah, come on.

285
00:18:41,984 --> 00:18:44,717
(horse whinnies)

286
00:19:08,184 --> 00:19:10,950
- [Sarah] (whispering) James.

287
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,284
- [James] Sarah?

288
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:15,683
- [Sarah] (whispering) Just us, alone.

289
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,518
(horse trotting)

290
00:19:29,351 --> 00:19:30,184
- [Man] Out of my way!

291
00:19:30,184 --> 00:19:33,017
(horse whinnying)

292
00:19:34,017 --> 00:19:34,850
Yah!

293
00:19:35,884 --> 00:19:37,151
- [James] Who are you?

294
00:19:37,151 --> 00:19:38,317
Sir!

295
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:39,151
Sir!

296
00:19:40,617 --> 00:19:43,384
(dramatic music)

297
00:19:56,284 --> 00:19:57,717
Sir, who are you?

298
00:19:59,783 --> 00:20:00,650
Yah!

299
00:20:00,650 --> 00:20:02,184
Sir!

300
00:20:02,184 --> 00:20:03,017
Sir!

301
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:07,417
(dramatic music)

302
00:20:43,251 --> 00:20:46,217
(carriage rattling)

303
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:55,151
Whoa.

304
00:20:55,151 --> 00:20:56,151
- Well, well, well, if it isn't

305
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:57,583
the midnight rambler himself!

306
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:58,417
How are we today, James?

307
00:20:58,417 --> 00:20:59,717
Oh, wait, let me guess.

308
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:00,518
Fine!

309
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:03,583
- He doesn't look so fine.

310
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,417
- I'm fine.

311
00:21:04,417 --> 00:21:05,284
- Oh, there you have it.

312
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:16,217
- Such a delusion.

313
00:21:16,217 --> 00:21:17,783
- Because you're a fool, Jenkins.

314
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:19,750
Why hate a movement whose main idea

315
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,817
is to encourage women to wear less petticoats?

316
00:21:22,817 --> 00:21:24,217
- I never thought of it that way.

317
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,284
(Fletcher sighs)

318
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,351
Oh, hell!

319
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:27,284
It's Professor Ambrose.

320
00:21:27,284 --> 00:21:28,484
If he sees me I am a dead man.

321
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:29,484
- Ambrose?

322
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:31,117
- Hide me, Fletch, quick.

323
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:32,351
- [James] Who is he?

324
00:21:32,351 --> 00:21:33,517
- [Jenkins] I missed his lecture last week.

325
00:21:33,517 --> 00:21:35,384
He's coming for me, I know it.

326
00:21:35,384 --> 00:21:36,817
- He's not coming for you, you coward.

327
00:21:36,817 --> 00:21:38,217
The coot probably doesn't even know you exist.

328
00:21:38,217 --> 00:21:39,717
- Who is this man?

329
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:40,650
- I didn't even know the man came out in the daylight.

330
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,050
- For God's sakes, who is this?

331
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:44,117
- Will you please settle down?

332
00:21:44,117 --> 00:21:46,050
- I'm sorry, I'm just...

333
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:47,517
Jenkins, what do you know about him?

334
00:21:47,517 --> 00:21:48,717
- Well-- - No, no.

335
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:52,717
Let's use this bait to retrieve our friend.

336
00:21:52,717 --> 00:21:54,750
Whist tonight at eight sharp.

337
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,717
You bring the brandy, we'll bring the gossip.

338
00:21:56,717 --> 00:21:59,517
(thunder rolling)

339
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,783
- Rumor has it he used to teach at Harvard

340
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:05,617
and that he resigned after rumors

341
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:06,884
that he killed a man.

342
00:22:06,884 --> 00:22:09,683
Nobody really knows much about Professor Ambrose.

343
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:11,084
Except that he has a penchant

344
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,517
for teaching highly suspect metaphysics

345
00:22:13,517 --> 00:22:15,217
and what's described in the course catalog

346
00:22:15,217 --> 00:22:16,984
as a physics class.

347
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:19,084
And that he's brilliant.

348
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:21,417
- Crazy is more like it.

349
00:22:21,417 --> 00:22:23,351
- Depends on who you ask.

350
00:22:23,351 --> 00:22:26,683
Some say he's still haunted by the ghost of his victim.

351
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,650
Anyway, rumor has it he's a dying man.

352
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,017
You should attend one night, James.

353
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:34,717
Quite interesting.

354
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:38,284
- It's all the rage with the young poser iconoclast set.

355
00:22:38,284 --> 00:22:40,450
- (scoffs) Just because the material he teaches

356
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,717
is over your head, Fletcher.

357
00:22:41,717 --> 00:22:42,917
- I would just like to know

358
00:22:42,917 --> 00:22:45,517
why anyone would leave Harvard University

359
00:22:45,517 --> 00:22:46,817
to teach at Goshen.

360
00:22:46,817 --> 00:22:48,717
- Well, he must have done something.

361
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:51,450
(dramatic music)

362
00:22:54,351 --> 00:22:56,450
- So what's the sudden interest in Ambrose?

363
00:22:59,017 --> 00:23:00,217
- Mm, curiosity, really.

364
00:23:01,251 --> 00:23:02,817
Interesting character, that's all.

365
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,517
(carriage rattling rapidly)

366
00:23:10,251 --> 00:23:13,217
(frightening music)

367
00:23:13,217 --> 00:23:15,450
(James gurgling)

368
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:18,284
(thunder rolling)

369
00:23:39,884 --> 00:23:44,884
- God! (coughing)

370
00:23:45,351 --> 00:23:46,184
God.

371
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,383
God.

372
00:23:54,617 --> 00:23:57,950
What if God did not exist?

373
00:24:00,084 --> 00:24:00,884
Faith.

374
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,050
We take it for granted and yet

375
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:06,950
we find it so difficult to believe

376
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,151
in other unseen phenomena.

377
00:24:10,017 --> 00:24:10,817
Why?

378
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,850
- Ah, yeah, he's a friend of mine, sir.

379
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:21,717
He just wanted, wanted...

380
00:24:21,717 --> 00:24:22,817
- Uh, James Farrow, sir.

381
00:24:22,817 --> 00:24:24,284
I'm just auditing.

382
00:24:24,284 --> 00:24:27,617
(Ambrose clears throat)

383
00:24:30,383 --> 00:24:31,683
- Just auditing?

384
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:35,084
Sampling the waters as it were.

385
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,416
- I suppose you could say that.

386
00:24:38,416 --> 00:24:41,084
- Without a determination to swim,

387
00:24:41,084 --> 00:24:42,450
that can lead to drowning.

388
00:24:43,917 --> 00:24:45,050
- Sir, I simply...

389
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:50,917
(Ambrose clears throat)

390
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:55,050
- Voyeurism is a dangerous occupation, Mr. Farrow.

391
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:56,817
I have no time for peeping toms,

392
00:24:56,817 --> 00:24:59,350
so either commit or exit.

393
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:03,251
- I'll stay, sir.

394
00:25:04,184 --> 00:25:06,184
- Well, the choice is yours.

395
00:25:06,184 --> 00:25:09,084
You have free will, I hope.

396
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:11,217
(clattering)

397
00:25:11,217 --> 00:25:12,017
Gravity.

398
00:25:13,217 --> 00:25:17,617
Gravity and sleep do not always coexist amicably.

399
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,683
(chair thudding)

400
00:25:22,984 --> 00:25:24,750
- I'm sorry, Professor Ambrose.

401
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:25,984
These late night classes--

402
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,383
- That's quite all right, Mr. Dickens.

403
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:30,650
(sighs) Sleep.

404
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:37,517
Some consider the ultimate sleep to be death.

405
00:25:37,517 --> 00:25:38,650
I do not.

406
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:42,416
No, death is a mere passage to

407
00:25:43,884 --> 00:25:47,316
a different mode of being, a separate plane of existence.

408
00:25:47,316 --> 00:25:52,283
There remain mysteries. (coughing)

409
00:25:55,117 --> 00:26:00,151
So keep your eyes and your minds open,

410
00:26:01,316 --> 00:26:05,084
gentlemen, the very survival of modern man

411
00:26:05,084 --> 00:26:06,017
depends on it.

412
00:26:07,383 --> 00:26:09,950
(wind blowing)

413
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:18,316
(dramatic music)

414
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:44,117
(lock clicking)

415
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,650
- Sarah?

416
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,084
Wait!

417
00:26:51,084 --> 00:26:51,984
Wait, Sarah!

418
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:57,517
(voices chattering)

419
00:26:57,517 --> 00:27:00,151
(wind howling)

420
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:17,183
(dramatic music)

421
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:29,617
(James crying)

422
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:32,450
(Sarah screaming)

423
00:27:35,383 --> 00:27:38,483
(eerie music)

424
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:41,150
(water flowing)

425
00:27:47,316 --> 00:27:48,150
Sarah!

426
00:27:49,416 --> 00:27:51,917
(James gasps)

427
00:27:53,017 --> 00:27:55,917
(James shuddering)

428
00:28:34,283 --> 00:28:35,683
Hello?

429
00:28:35,683 --> 00:28:38,183
(door creaks)

430
00:28:39,083 --> 00:28:39,917
Hello?

431
00:28:53,283 --> 00:28:55,683
(door slams)

432
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,083
Hello?

433
00:29:00,216 --> 00:29:00,984
Hello?

434
00:29:08,316 --> 00:29:09,150
Sarah?

435
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,383
(cracking)

436
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:12,350
- Damn you, sir!

437
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:13,517
Out! (coughing)

438
00:29:13,517 --> 00:29:14,783
Out of my house!

439
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:15,617
Out, out!

440
00:29:16,617 --> 00:29:21,083
Out! (coughing)

441
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:24,884
(pounding)

442
00:29:26,216 --> 00:29:28,950
(dramatic music)

443
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,083
- Sir?

444
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,250
This one's got initials on it.

445
00:29:52,383 --> 00:29:54,183
- They've all got initials on them.

446
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:57,416
(waves lapping nearby)

447
00:30:22,216 --> 00:30:24,383
We're looking for a man with dirty fingernails.

448
00:30:28,416 --> 00:30:31,850
(James straining)

449
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:34,583
(James shouting)

450
00:30:40,416 --> 00:30:42,750
(James grunting)

451
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,116
(slicing)

452
00:30:44,116 --> 00:30:45,083
(James gurgling)

453
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:47,817
(James shouting)

454
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:53,183
- For God's sakes, wake up!

455
00:30:54,383 --> 00:30:56,316
You're screaming like a stuck pig!

456
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:57,983
(James muttering)

457
00:30:57,983 --> 00:31:00,150
James, you're babbling, wake up!

458
00:31:05,884 --> 00:31:07,450
- I'm sorry.

459
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,783
I'm fine.

460
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,049
I'm just having a bad dream.

461
00:31:10,049 --> 00:31:10,983
- Yes, well, yeah, I can tell you now

462
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:12,717
I am concerned about you.

463
00:31:12,717 --> 00:31:15,316
Perhaps I should just postpone my holiday entirely.

464
00:31:15,316 --> 00:31:16,216
- No.

465
00:31:16,216 --> 00:31:18,150
No, don't be foolish.

466
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:18,983
I'm fine.

467
00:31:18,983 --> 00:31:20,116
- Fine?

468
00:31:20,116 --> 00:31:21,750
Shall we confer with Mr. Webster

469
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:23,717
over the definition of that word, fine?

470
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:28,316
(eerie music)

471
00:31:28,316 --> 00:31:30,216
(James muttering)

472
00:31:30,216 --> 00:31:31,083
James, what?

473
00:31:31,083 --> 00:31:31,916
What is it?

474
00:31:34,049 --> 00:31:35,216
- Uh, nothing.

475
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:42,049
(Fletcher scoffs)

476
00:31:46,216 --> 00:31:48,949
(James shudders)

477
00:31:50,316 --> 00:31:53,016
(wind whistling)

478
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:57,016
- Struck down in the flower of her youth.

479
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:03,116
Sarah was a kindly girl, not given to harsh words

480
00:32:03,116 --> 00:32:04,817
nor temptations of the flesh.

481
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:09,283
We beseech Thee to gather into Thy bosom

482
00:32:10,483 --> 00:32:12,350
our newly departed one in the name of

483
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:15,116
our Lord Jesus Christ, amen.

484
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:16,617
- [Mourners] Amen.

485
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:24,083
(James crying)

486
00:32:28,383 --> 00:32:30,883
(eerie music)

487
00:32:36,849 --> 00:32:39,416
(James crying)

488
00:32:50,150 --> 00:32:53,316
(mourners gasp)

489
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:55,116
- [Sarah] Come, James.

490
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:57,849
(James gasps)

491
00:32:57,849 --> 00:33:01,717
- Struck down in the flower of her youth.

492
00:33:01,717 --> 00:33:06,150
Sarah was a kindly girl, not given to harsh words

493
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,517
or temptations of flesh.

494
00:33:09,916 --> 00:33:13,116
We beseech They to gather into Thy bosom

495
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,150
our newly departed one in the name of

496
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:17,483
our Lord Jesus Christ.

497
00:33:17,483 --> 00:33:18,949
- [Mourners] Amen.

498
00:33:18,949 --> 00:33:21,916
Our Father who art in heaven,

499
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:24,450
hallowed be thy name.

500
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:27,550
Thy kingdom come, thou will be done

501
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,683
on earth as it is in heaven.

502
00:33:30,683 --> 00:33:33,350
Give us this day our daily bread

503
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,916
and forgive us our trespasses...

504
00:33:36,916 --> 00:33:39,483
(rain falling)

505
00:33:52,583 --> 00:33:53,583
- Professor Ambrose?

506
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,416
It's James Farrow, sir, the new student.

507
00:34:00,617 --> 00:34:01,916
- What are you doing here?

508
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:05,049
Are you following me?

509
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,949
- No, sir, uh, I was...

510
00:34:07,816 --> 00:34:08,916
I was...

511
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,650
I just saw you and, um,

512
00:34:13,849 --> 00:34:14,983
may I sit for a moment?

513
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:20,350
(Ambrose sighs)

514
00:34:25,116 --> 00:34:26,916
Sir, do you believe in an afterlife?

515
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:29,883
(Ambrose chuckles)

516
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:31,849
- Life is multifaceted, Mr. Farrow.

517
00:34:34,483 --> 00:34:35,749
- Then your belief is--

518
00:34:35,749 --> 00:34:38,450
- It's not a question of belief, young man.

519
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,517
It's a matter of knowledge.

520
00:34:41,517 --> 00:34:42,350
Good day.

521
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:47,316
- But how can you be so certain?

522
00:34:49,517 --> 00:34:52,849
- Because I have, on numerous occasions,

523
00:34:52,849 --> 00:34:54,983
witnessed a phenomenon for which there is

524
00:34:54,983 --> 00:34:57,283
no rational explanation.

525
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,650
- So the stories are true?

526
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:06,250
- What stories?

527
00:35:07,883 --> 00:35:09,550
- Gossip, really, sir.

528
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,283
And I'd much rather hear the truth.

529
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:14,617
They say you killed someone and you're a haunted man.

530
00:35:19,716 --> 00:35:21,483
- What do you want of me, hmm?

531
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,617
- I believe I'm being haunted by the ghost of a dead woman.

532
00:35:32,316 --> 00:35:35,150
- Mr. Farrow, the mind...

533
00:35:36,583 --> 00:35:39,749
No one has sufficiently explored its complexities.

534
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:43,517
There is a certain Dr. Freud in Vienna

535
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:44,450
who writes of a dream therapy--

536
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:45,716
- No, I beg your pardon, sir,

537
00:35:45,716 --> 00:35:47,949
but these images, they're too vivid.

538
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:48,783
They're too real--

539
00:35:48,783 --> 00:35:49,883
- [Sarah] James.

540
00:35:49,883 --> 00:35:52,716
(thunder rolling)

541
00:35:53,849 --> 00:35:54,682
- Mr. Farrow?

542
00:35:59,116 --> 00:36:00,016
Mr. Farrow.

543
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:04,316
- Uh, I'm sorry, I...

544
00:36:05,316 --> 00:36:06,517
I thought I...

545
00:36:06,517 --> 00:36:09,016
- Perhaps you've been working too hard.

546
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,016
Good night's sleep--

547
00:36:11,016 --> 00:36:13,416
- Professor, I need to know.

548
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:14,550
Professor, would you...

549
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:18,383
Could you tell me of this ghost of yours?

550
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:22,250
- Telling of this story will bring

551
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,916
nothing but sorrow.

552
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,450
- But there might be some similarities.

553
00:36:29,450 --> 00:36:31,116
I mean, there might be.

554
00:36:32,016 --> 00:36:34,483
Sir, please.

555
00:36:35,583 --> 00:36:36,416
I am...

556
00:36:37,716 --> 00:36:38,517
Lost.

557
00:36:42,716 --> 00:36:44,216
- Very well, then.

558
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:45,983
But not here and not now.

559
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,517
Tomorrow night in my study.

560
00:36:50,783 --> 00:36:52,049
- Thank you, sir.

561
00:36:52,049 --> 00:36:52,883
Thank you.

562
00:36:54,083 --> 00:36:56,183
- Breathe not a word to your colleagues.

563
00:36:56,183 --> 00:36:57,550
- No, of course not.

564
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,350
- Not a word, I warn you.

565
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:07,049
(Ambrose coughing)

566
00:37:11,283 --> 00:37:13,849
(rain falling)

567
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:21,782
Get up, get up!

568
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:25,649
Come on! (horse clopping)

569
00:37:25,649 --> 00:37:28,416
(mournful music)

570
00:37:56,516 --> 00:38:00,049
- [James] (shouting) Sarah!

571
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:00,849
Sarah!

572
00:38:03,416 --> 00:38:04,250
Sarah!

573
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:24,216
- [Sarah] Just us, my love.

574
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,216
Come to me, James

575
00:38:28,216 --> 00:38:29,150
Come to me.

576
00:38:47,482 --> 00:38:48,416
Promise me.

577
00:38:57,849 --> 00:39:02,849
(knocking) (James gasps)

578
00:39:03,582 --> 00:39:04,549
- [James] Who is it?

579
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:06,383
I said who is it?

580
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:07,616
- Oh, it's me, Jenkins.

581
00:39:11,516 --> 00:39:13,316
Hey, where's Fletch?

582
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:15,949
I need to get another drink.

583
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:18,616
- He's gone, he's visiting his sister in Providence.

584
00:39:18,616 --> 00:39:19,516
- Oh.

585
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:20,350
- Jenkins, it's late.

586
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,216
- Well, why are you up?

587
00:39:22,649 --> 00:39:25,383
- I couldn't sleep. (sniffles)

588
00:39:25,383 --> 00:39:26,216
But you should.

589
00:39:29,616 --> 00:39:30,449
- Okay.

590
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:34,482
Did you hear the latest about that girl in Portsmouth?

591
00:39:36,716 --> 00:39:38,183
- No, why?

592
00:39:38,183 --> 00:39:41,216
- Oh, they say it's murder.

593
00:39:41,216 --> 00:39:42,816
Now they're looking for someone.

594
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:47,049
- Oh.

595
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:48,549
Well, thanks.

596
00:39:48,549 --> 00:39:49,383
Goodnight.

597
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:50,216
- No, hey, wait.

598
00:39:51,449 --> 00:39:52,649
I bet I know who did it.

599
00:39:54,283 --> 00:39:55,116
- What?

600
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:56,716
What do you mean?

601
00:39:56,716 --> 00:39:59,482
(Jenkins laughs)

602
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:02,250
- Fletcher! (laughs)

603
00:40:02,250 --> 00:40:03,582
That's why he left town.

604
00:40:03,582 --> 00:40:05,682
I knew the moment I saw that guy's

605
00:40:05,682 --> 00:40:08,682
eyes he was a killer. (laughs)

606
00:40:08,682 --> 00:40:10,250
(thuds) (Jenkins groans)

607
00:40:10,250 --> 00:40:11,616
- [James] Jenkins?

608
00:40:11,616 --> 00:40:13,250
- Yeah?

609
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,582
- Goodnight.

610
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:17,016
(door shuts)

611
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,883
(thunder rolling)

612
00:40:30,883 --> 00:40:33,649
(dramatic music)

613
00:40:43,716 --> 00:40:46,849
- I was happily married once.

614
00:40:52,216 --> 00:40:55,382
When I first met my wife, Lydia,

615
00:40:55,382 --> 00:40:59,150
I was like you, a student.

616
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:02,949
But being from another country,

617
00:41:04,116 --> 00:41:07,083
almost friendless and certainly penniless

618
00:41:08,482 --> 00:41:09,849
with barely enough money for bread,

619
00:41:09,849 --> 00:41:11,516
let alone books.

620
00:41:15,283 --> 00:41:17,049
But looking back now,

621
00:41:18,983 --> 00:41:21,482
that was the time of my life.

622
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:25,083
I loved her more than...

623
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,849
(fire crackling)

624
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:34,949
Maybe more than I should.

625
00:41:37,682 --> 00:41:42,315
Most men in my position would have been delighted

626
00:41:42,315 --> 00:41:45,150
to find that their wife was pregnant

627
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:46,116
for the first time.

628
00:41:47,849 --> 00:41:50,849
I, however, could not imagine

629
00:41:51,782 --> 00:41:53,349
losing any part of her.

630
00:41:54,749 --> 00:41:57,682
I feared that a child would take her away from me.

631
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:03,083
My wife died in childbirth.

632
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:08,016
I lost the only happiness I'd ever known.

633
00:42:10,482 --> 00:42:14,415
She'd took my heart with her to the grave.

634
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:19,016
Yes, I believed that I had been cursed.

635
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,415
Left to raise my daughter on my own.

636
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:27,582
(dramatic music)

637
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,449
I never told Lucy that the house had been

638
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:38,049
left to us both by her mother's estate.

639
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:44,516
My excuses about paying rent were pure invention,

640
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:50,215
a device to ensure a safe distance.

641
00:42:53,782 --> 00:42:55,682
She was my flesh and blood,

642
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:00,983
but her mother's death haunted me.

643
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:04,816
Being a father is not a position

644
00:43:04,816 --> 00:43:07,116
for which I was ever suited

645
00:43:08,916 --> 00:43:11,282
and Lucy must have sensed my remoteness.

646
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:15,716
And then, finally, we'd come to an arrangement.

647
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:21,415
She looked after me, I looked after our affairs and...

648
00:43:26,182 --> 00:43:30,949
And one day I returned from lecturing in Boston.

649
00:43:32,049 --> 00:43:35,549
(horse galloping)

650
00:43:35,549 --> 00:43:38,315
(dramatic music)

651
00:43:53,949 --> 00:43:54,782
- Father!

652
00:43:58,415 --> 00:43:59,783
- Get out.

653
00:43:59,783 --> 00:44:01,649
- [Man] Sir, allow me to explain.

654
00:44:01,649 --> 00:44:04,449
- You, sir, are trespassing in my house.

655
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,282
- This man...

656
00:44:07,449 --> 00:44:09,249
Is to be my husband.

657
00:44:09,249 --> 00:44:10,816
We seek your blessing.

658
00:44:10,816 --> 00:44:11,983
- My blessing?

659
00:44:14,916 --> 00:44:16,682
How can you even imagine--

660
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:17,716
- Because I love him.

661
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:23,682
Please.

662
00:44:23,682 --> 00:44:26,116
Just share a glass of wine with us.

663
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:27,449
- Get out of my house.

664
00:44:27,449 --> 00:44:28,282
- [Lucy] Please, Father, if you'd just--

665
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:29,549
- Out!

666
00:44:29,549 --> 00:44:30,749
- If you would just listen, I need you.

667
00:44:30,749 --> 00:44:31,582
- Out!

668
00:44:31,582 --> 00:44:32,415
- Father, please!

669
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:35,115
I want your blessing.

670
00:44:35,115 --> 00:44:36,816
(glass shatters)

671
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:38,249
- How dare you defy me!

672
00:44:38,249 --> 00:44:42,149
I will arrange any marriage of yours.

673
00:44:42,149 --> 00:44:45,016
- Sir, if I had known.

674
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,482
- Well, now you know, sir.

675
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:48,249
And mark my words, if you go against my wishes,

676
00:44:48,249 --> 00:44:50,783
I will make sure that your name is destroyed

677
00:44:50,783 --> 00:44:52,716
- Do not let him do this to us.

678
00:44:52,716 --> 00:44:55,215
- And as for you, I curse you.

679
00:44:55,215 --> 00:44:56,549
You're dead to me.

680
00:44:56,549 --> 00:44:57,382
Dead!

681
00:45:02,582 --> 00:45:05,549
Eventually (clears throat)

682
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:08,849
my anger died.

683
00:45:11,516 --> 00:45:13,315
I went back to the house in hope

684
00:45:13,315 --> 00:45:16,883
of affecting a reconciliation, but...

685
00:45:19,916 --> 00:45:21,249
It was too late.

686
00:45:22,849 --> 00:45:25,582
(dramatic music)

687
00:45:37,449 --> 00:45:39,149
There was a note for me.

688
00:45:40,415 --> 00:45:41,382
It was from him.

689
00:45:42,749 --> 00:45:45,449
He said that she was dead,

690
00:45:45,449 --> 00:45:48,016
that she'd passed away after falling into a coma.

691
00:45:49,682 --> 00:45:53,516
He wrote that the life had simply gone out of her.

692
00:45:53,516 --> 00:45:55,649
That I had taken her will to go on.

693
00:45:57,516 --> 00:46:00,782
(crying) I was stupid.

694
00:46:12,549 --> 00:46:14,415
(dog howling nearby)

695
00:46:14,415 --> 00:46:17,182
(Ambrose crying)

696
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:20,415
Purgatory.

697
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:26,215
A way station, an in between place

698
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:31,616
where souls who have died seek expiation

699
00:46:35,215 --> 00:46:36,349
or revenge.

700
00:46:37,883 --> 00:46:40,782
(bell tolling)

701
00:46:40,782 --> 00:46:42,749
That is all for tonight.

702
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:43,582
Go.

703
00:46:47,449 --> 00:46:51,382
(students chattering)

704
00:46:51,382 --> 00:46:52,582
- Boo!

705
00:46:52,582 --> 00:46:55,249
(laughing) Hey, you know that murder in town?

706
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:58,382
- Jenkins, do you have anything else to speak of?

707
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:00,115
- It's all the talk of town, okay?

708
00:47:00,115 --> 00:47:02,849
I was just going to say now they suspect a young man.

709
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:06,048
Possibly a college student. (laughs)

710
00:47:06,048 --> 00:47:07,315
Is that keen?

711
00:47:07,315 --> 00:47:09,449
Maybe it really was Fletcher.

712
00:47:09,449 --> 00:47:11,415
- Don't be absurd.

713
00:47:11,415 --> 00:47:14,015
(bell tolling)

714
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:30,215
- Tomorrow, noon.

715
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,182
At the cemetery where we first set out.

716
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:37,916
I'll finish my story if you wish. (coughs)

717
00:47:37,916 --> 00:47:40,649
(dramatic music)

718
00:47:53,716 --> 00:47:56,449
(Sarah laughing)

719
00:47:57,382 --> 00:48:00,115
(water flowing)

720
00:48:02,915 --> 00:48:06,582
(Sarah laughing menacingly)

721
00:48:10,282 --> 00:48:13,015
(water sloshing)

722
00:48:18,215 --> 00:48:20,315
- [Sarah] Alone together.

723
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:22,849
Come, James.

724
00:48:25,182 --> 00:48:26,015
- Lucy.

725
00:48:28,182 --> 00:48:33,182
When she died, I tried to make a stone of my heart,

726
00:48:34,315 --> 00:48:36,415
just as I had after my wife's death.

727
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:42,115
I fought my emotions with all my strength.

728
00:48:42,115 --> 00:48:45,415
(chuckle) But I still had not learned.

729
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:51,982
Then one night I was awakened from my sleep

730
00:48:53,449 --> 00:48:54,549
by something.

731
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:58,516
(mysterious music)

732
00:49:08,616 --> 00:49:12,382
(moaning) Who's there?

733
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,215
Oh.

734
00:49:15,382 --> 00:49:16,915
Hmm.

735
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,749
(rattling nearby)

736
00:49:26,948 --> 00:49:28,115
Who is it?

737
00:49:28,115 --> 00:49:31,115
(doorknob rattling)

738
00:49:33,349 --> 00:49:34,915
Who's there?

739
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:35,749
Hmm?

740
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:45,815
(doorknob rattling)

741
00:49:45,815 --> 00:49:48,315
(pounds door)

742
00:49:49,649 --> 00:49:52,749
(door crashing open)

743
00:49:53,782 --> 00:49:54,616
What?

744
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:57,616
Who?

745
00:50:00,815 --> 00:50:01,649
Lydia?

746
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:05,415
Ah?

747
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:06,249
Oh.

748
00:50:07,782 --> 00:50:08,616
Lucy?

749
00:50:13,915 --> 00:50:14,749
(flowing)

750
00:50:14,749 --> 00:50:15,582
Oh, ah!

751
00:50:27,215 --> 00:50:31,349
Who are you?

752
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:32,582
What do you want?

753
00:50:39,382 --> 00:50:42,249
(Ambrose grunting)

754
00:50:44,048 --> 00:50:46,682
(birds singing)

755
00:51:04,915 --> 00:51:06,215
- So it was a dream.

756
00:51:07,215 --> 00:51:09,349
That was it, wasn't it?

757
00:51:09,349 --> 00:51:12,549
- I prayed that it was only a dream.

758
00:51:12,549 --> 00:51:17,315
But that night, in my sleep, the apparition returned.

759
00:51:22,882 --> 00:51:25,249
(door crashing open)

760
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,282
(glass shattering)

761
00:51:27,282 --> 00:51:30,115
(Ambrose moaning)

762
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:37,549
(Ambrose sighs)

763
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:42,249
Ow.

764
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:45,382
Everything was as it had been, but it was no dream.

765
00:51:47,382 --> 00:51:50,382
I tried to get on with my life, but...

766
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:53,149
But my work suffered.

767
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:55,848
And when I tried to explain to my colleagues

768
00:51:55,848 --> 00:51:57,182
what was happening, they...

769
00:51:58,415 --> 00:52:00,282
I ruined my academic reputation.

770
00:52:00,282 --> 00:52:03,782
They asked me to resign my position.

771
00:52:03,782 --> 00:52:06,982
No other institution would take me.

772
00:52:06,982 --> 00:52:10,549
The house, the house was my only means

773
00:52:10,549 --> 00:52:12,149
of support left to me.

774
00:52:13,249 --> 00:52:15,848
I resolved to rent it out,

775
00:52:15,848 --> 00:52:20,149
to be rid of the place once and for all. (sighs)

776
00:52:22,648 --> 00:52:25,482
But she had other ideas.

777
00:52:25,482 --> 00:52:28,015
As you can see, it's quite well kept.

778
00:52:30,115 --> 00:52:33,315
The house is a little cold during this season, but we,

779
00:52:34,715 --> 00:52:37,715
I have a plentiful supply of firewood.

780
00:52:44,681 --> 00:52:47,249
(door opening)

781
00:52:48,648 --> 00:52:51,681
In truth, I'm quite sorry to be moving away.

782
00:52:53,149 --> 00:52:56,549
The house has been in my wife's family for generations.

783
00:52:58,715 --> 00:52:59,982
- Did you hear that?

784
00:53:02,048 --> 00:53:03,415
- Oh it's probably just the wind.

785
00:53:03,415 --> 00:53:05,282
The house is extremely well ventilated

786
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:06,549
for the hot summer months.

787
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:08,249
Excuse me, sir, allow me.

788
00:53:09,349 --> 00:53:11,648
Uh, this room, I...

789
00:53:11,648 --> 00:53:13,215
Well, the view from this window,

790
00:53:13,215 --> 00:53:15,315
I think you'll find, is quite exceptional.

791
00:53:18,781 --> 00:53:21,282
(eerie music)

792
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:27,282
- Oh!

793
00:53:31,781 --> 00:53:34,715
- There was nothing I could do after that.

794
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:39,516
No one would come near the place.

795
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:43,415
Not to rent it, not to help farm it.

796
00:53:43,415 --> 00:53:47,315
It was then that she came to me with a proposition.

797
00:53:47,315 --> 00:53:50,048
"Leave this house to me," she said.

798
00:53:50,048 --> 00:53:51,182
- (whispering) Leave this house to me.

799
00:53:51,182 --> 00:53:52,581
I have marked up the will.

800
00:53:52,581 --> 00:53:53,781
Go off and live elsewhere.

801
00:53:53,781 --> 00:53:55,249
But when you need me to do so,

802
00:53:55,249 --> 00:53:56,748
I will be your tenant, for you can find no other.

803
00:53:56,748 --> 00:53:59,182
- [Ambrose] "I will be your tenant,

804
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:01,082
since you can find no other."

805
00:54:01,948 --> 00:54:04,848
And she gave me a bag of coins

806
00:54:04,848 --> 00:54:06,249
- You can find no other.

807
00:54:08,282 --> 00:54:09,449
Leave this house to me.

808
00:54:10,648 --> 00:54:12,315
- But there was a condition attached

809
00:54:13,681 --> 00:54:17,815
that I must come in person every week to collect the rent.

810
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:22,548
It is a ritual to which I will never grow accustomed.

811
00:54:24,915 --> 00:54:28,548
It grows more toxic with each visit.

812
00:54:29,449 --> 00:54:30,615
A slow death.

813
00:54:35,882 --> 00:54:38,615
(dramatic music)

814
00:54:47,115 --> 00:54:50,048
A bag of coins and a glass of wine.

815
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:57,048
An offering, which I so heartlessly refused

816
00:54:57,048 --> 00:54:59,882
when she was alive. (coughing)

817
00:54:59,882 --> 00:55:03,548
- The coins she gives you, are they real

818
00:55:04,449 --> 00:55:07,282
and of this world?

819
00:55:07,282 --> 00:55:11,015
- Oh, you question my sanity. (chuckles)

820
00:55:11,015 --> 00:55:12,715
Well, why should you be different?

821
00:55:13,782 --> 00:55:15,182
I question it myself.

822
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:19,215
Oh yes, yes, the coins are real,

823
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:21,948
but old, always old.

824
00:55:21,948 --> 00:55:24,948
None of them dates beyond the day that she died

825
00:55:24,948 --> 00:55:28,882
and each week I feel my soul becoming more poisoned.

826
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:35,481
I survive upon this ghostly rental,

827
00:55:35,481 --> 00:55:38,015
but I cannot say how or why.

828
00:55:39,748 --> 00:55:43,915
The line between dream and reality has eroded for me.

829
00:55:46,249 --> 00:55:50,715
Practical and rational things mean nothing to me.

830
00:55:54,415 --> 00:55:57,282
Some things cannot be mended.

831
00:55:59,382 --> 00:56:01,948
(bell tolling)

832
00:56:04,715 --> 00:56:06,448
I shall be late for an appointment.

833
00:56:08,315 --> 00:56:10,015
That is my story.

834
00:56:11,815 --> 00:56:12,882
For what it is worth.

835
00:56:14,249 --> 00:56:15,915
Do not repeat it.

836
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:16,715
- Sir.

837
00:56:18,615 --> 00:56:20,581
May I accompany you on your appointment?

838
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:22,882
- You know where I'm going.

839
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:23,715
- Yes.

840
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,048
It's the end of the week.

841
00:56:28,781 --> 00:56:31,681
(sighs) I need to see, sir,

842
00:56:32,681 --> 00:56:37,681
with my own eyes, what you see.

843
00:56:38,414 --> 00:56:39,648
- God in heaven, why?

844
00:56:39,648 --> 00:56:42,381
- If I could just see what you've seen, then--

845
00:56:42,381 --> 00:56:45,048
- Then you would know that you are not insane,

846
00:56:45,048 --> 00:56:47,948
that perhaps you have imagined everything eh, eh?

847
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:49,249
- No, this girl.

848
00:56:51,782 --> 00:56:52,781
God, she has a name.

849
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:57,481
She's Sarah.

850
00:57:00,015 --> 00:57:01,115
We used to uh...

851
00:57:04,915 --> 00:57:08,149
In my dreams she appears to me at the house,

852
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:09,315
at your house.

853
00:57:10,215 --> 00:57:11,381
We were there together.

854
00:57:13,048 --> 00:57:16,715
Then she had dreams that maybe we could live there.

855
00:57:20,581 --> 00:57:23,414
And now I think she demands it.

856
00:57:23,414 --> 00:57:25,048
I mean, she...

857
00:57:25,048 --> 00:57:26,581
She calls me to the house.

858
00:57:34,481 --> 00:57:37,982
- There is no peace to make with the dead.

859
00:57:39,015 --> 00:57:40,782
Move on with your life.

860
00:57:46,015 --> 00:57:48,448
And upon your life do not follow me!

861
00:57:54,982 --> 00:57:55,815
- But...

862
00:57:55,815 --> 00:57:58,648
(thunder rolling)

863
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,781
Excuse me, miss?

864
00:58:11,348 --> 00:58:12,381
Pardon me, miss.

865
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:16,715
(James shudders)

866
00:58:29,882 --> 00:58:32,882
(suspenseful music)

867
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:35,848
(thunder crashing)

868
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:38,448
(knocking)

869
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,115
(door creaking)

870
00:58:44,281 --> 00:58:45,681
- Doctor Tilton, yes?

871
00:58:48,381 --> 00:58:51,948
(carriage rattling nearby)

872
00:58:55,149 --> 00:58:58,149
(people chattering)

873
00:59:08,215 --> 00:59:09,715
- [Policeman] Yes.

874
00:59:11,082 --> 00:59:13,248
Well, what does that mean?

875
00:59:14,581 --> 00:59:16,581
Had you seen him before?

876
00:59:22,715 --> 00:59:24,548
- [Tilton] That's him.

877
00:59:27,948 --> 00:59:29,414
- [Policeman] You!

878
00:59:29,414 --> 00:59:30,248
Hey, you!

879
00:59:31,381 --> 00:59:32,214
Hold it!

880
00:59:34,348 --> 00:59:35,715
(crashing)

881
00:59:35,715 --> 00:59:36,882
- What do you think you're doing?

882
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:38,314
- Sorry!

883
00:59:38,314 --> 00:59:39,281
(tense music)

884
00:59:39,281 --> 00:59:41,115
- [Policeman] Hold it!

885
00:59:54,015 --> 00:59:54,848
Stop!

886
00:59:57,615 --> 00:59:58,448
Hey, stop!

887
01:00:00,748 --> 01:00:01,581
Let's go.

888
01:00:08,581 --> 01:00:09,414
- Ah!

889
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:11,448
- [Policeman] Go that way!

890
01:00:11,448 --> 01:00:12,782
- Out of my way!

891
01:00:14,348 --> 01:00:16,848
(eerie music)

892
01:00:39,848 --> 01:00:40,615
- Stop!

893
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:43,515
Hey!

894
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:58,848
(men grunting)

895
01:01:01,148 --> 01:01:01,982
Stop!

896
01:01:03,181 --> 01:01:04,082
Stop!

897
01:01:04,082 --> 01:01:06,414
(gun fires)

898
01:01:16,248 --> 01:01:17,848
(splashing)

899
01:01:17,848 --> 01:01:20,515
(barkeep gasps)

900
01:01:26,648 --> 01:01:29,314
(James panting)

901
01:01:31,015 --> 01:01:33,748
(fire crackling)

902
01:01:41,181 --> 01:01:44,015
(nervous tapping)

903
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:01,081
(doorknob rattling)

904
01:02:08,414 --> 01:02:10,181
- You look like bloody hell, James.

905
01:02:11,882 --> 01:02:13,681
- Good to see you, too, Fletch.

906
01:02:13,681 --> 01:02:15,181
- Still not sleeping, eh?

907
01:02:18,214 --> 01:02:19,615
- I can sleep when I'm dead.

908
01:02:20,715 --> 01:02:21,982
- It might come sooner than you think

909
01:02:21,982 --> 01:02:23,815
if you don't take care of yourself.

910
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:31,748
- [James] What is that?

911
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,581
- Laudanum.

912
01:02:33,648 --> 01:02:35,615
Four drops of that,

913
01:02:35,615 --> 01:02:37,581
you'll sleep like the dead, I promise.

914
01:02:43,015 --> 01:02:43,815
- Thank you.

915
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:49,481
(James shuddering)

916
01:02:51,348 --> 01:02:52,615
- [Man] Sloth, hmm?

917
01:02:52,615 --> 01:02:53,414
Anger.

918
01:02:54,848 --> 01:02:55,982
Acute human passions.

919
01:02:55,982 --> 01:02:56,781
- Sarah...

920
01:02:58,515 --> 01:03:00,114
(bell tolling)

921
01:03:00,114 --> 01:03:02,081
(glass smashing)

922
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:02,915
(Sarah shouting)

923
01:03:02,915 --> 01:03:05,648
(James starting)

924
01:03:20,815 --> 01:03:23,548
(dramatic music)

925
01:03:29,948 --> 01:03:32,781
(thunder rolling)

926
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:43,081
(creaking)

927
01:03:44,748 --> 01:03:47,481
(horse clopping)

928
01:03:51,981 --> 01:03:54,748
(wind whistling)

929
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:12,947
(horse nickers)

930
01:04:19,615 --> 01:04:22,515
(Ambrose mumbling)

931
01:04:34,214 --> 01:04:36,715
(eerie music)

932
01:04:42,681 --> 01:04:46,248
(Ambrose breathing deeply)

933
01:04:52,681 --> 01:04:55,414
(coins jangling)

934
01:04:58,815 --> 01:05:01,715
(foreboding music)

935
01:05:19,548 --> 01:05:22,381
(Ambrose gulping)

936
01:05:27,848 --> 01:05:31,014
(students chattering)

937
01:05:32,148 --> 01:05:33,014
- Sweet dreams?

938
01:05:39,881 --> 01:05:40,715
- Quiet.

939
01:05:42,414 --> 01:05:44,681
Professor Ambrose has taken ill.

940
01:05:46,114 --> 01:05:50,281
This extracurricular class is henceforth terminated

941
01:05:50,281 --> 01:05:52,847
and I'll be teaching at appropriate hours.

942
01:05:52,847 --> 01:05:53,748
That is all.

943
01:05:55,081 --> 01:05:58,248
(students chattering)

944
01:06:00,181 --> 01:06:00,981
- James.

945
01:06:02,648 --> 01:06:04,281
Join us tonight for dinner.

946
01:06:04,281 --> 01:06:05,914
No excuses.

947
01:06:05,914 --> 01:06:07,014
I'm worried about you.

948
01:06:12,548 --> 01:06:15,381
(horses trotting)

949
01:06:22,481 --> 01:06:23,715
- Professor John Ambrose.

950
01:06:25,214 --> 01:06:27,148
- I'm quite aware of my own name, sir.

951
01:06:28,448 --> 01:06:29,715
Who, may I ask, are you?

952
01:06:29,715 --> 01:06:32,814
- Inspector Ryan, Portsmouth Police.

953
01:06:32,814 --> 01:06:34,481
I'm here on police business.

954
01:06:34,481 --> 01:06:36,448
- Yes, that would follow.

955
01:06:36,448 --> 01:06:38,014
- Professor, if you don't mind me saying so,

956
01:06:38,014 --> 01:06:39,081
you don't look well.

957
01:06:42,281 --> 01:06:43,847
- Thank you, Inspector.

958
01:06:43,847 --> 01:06:46,448
Impeccable detective work.

959
01:06:46,448 --> 01:06:50,615
But please, tell me how I may be of service to you.

960
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:00,615
(dramatic music)

961
01:07:02,681 --> 01:07:04,114
(thunder rolling)

962
01:07:04,114 --> 01:07:05,047
(guests chattering)

963
01:07:05,047 --> 01:07:06,348
- [Woman] It was wonderful.

964
01:07:06,348 --> 01:07:07,780
- I heard it was the clap.

965
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:10,381
Got it from a French whore in Boston. (laughs)

966
01:07:10,381 --> 01:07:11,581
- I'm surprised the man's sick.

967
01:07:11,581 --> 01:07:13,148
All this time I thought he was already dead.

968
01:07:13,148 --> 01:07:14,681
(Jenkins laughs)

969
01:07:14,681 --> 01:07:16,481
- Fletcher, don't speak of what you don't understand!

970
01:07:21,681 --> 01:07:22,981
Forgive me, I'm--

971
01:07:22,981 --> 01:07:23,847
- It's forgotten.

972
01:07:25,414 --> 01:07:28,314
- The police have a new lead on their murder case.

973
01:07:28,314 --> 01:07:30,248
- What are you, sleeping at the constabulary?

974
01:07:30,248 --> 01:07:31,414
- It's a big story.

975
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:35,448
Can I help it if I have a natural vocation as a journalist?

976
01:07:35,448 --> 01:07:36,914
- That would explain the copious amounts

977
01:07:36,914 --> 01:07:38,515
of alcohol you imbibe.

978
01:07:39,581 --> 01:07:40,814
- What?

979
01:07:40,814 --> 01:07:43,814
- What's, what's the big news, Jenkins?

980
01:07:45,914 --> 01:07:47,714
- There was a chase in town the other night.

981
01:07:47,714 --> 01:07:50,114
The man got away, but they got plenty of good evidence

982
01:07:50,114 --> 01:07:52,214
and a lot of eyewitness descriptions.

983
01:07:52,214 --> 01:07:53,847
- Well, were these eyewitnesses blind?

984
01:07:53,847 --> 01:07:55,014
Did anyone recognize him?

985
01:07:55,014 --> 01:07:56,148
- Yes, they did.

986
01:07:57,281 --> 01:07:59,381
And they know where to find him.

987
01:07:59,381 --> 01:08:02,014
- [Fletcher] Yes, tell us.

988
01:08:02,014 --> 01:08:04,914
- Oh, I'm not so stupid now, eh?

989
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:08,515
Found out he's a student.

990
01:08:10,181 --> 01:08:11,947
Right here at Goshen.

991
01:08:11,947 --> 01:08:13,515
- (scoffs) Are you kidding?

992
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:14,681
- No, I'm not.

993
01:08:15,581 --> 01:08:16,414
(thunder rolls)

994
01:08:16,414 --> 01:08:17,248
- Excuse me.

995
01:08:21,047 --> 01:08:23,214
(Fletcher sighs)

996
01:08:23,214 --> 01:08:24,047
- Mm-mm.

997
01:08:25,515 --> 01:08:28,114
(rain falling)

998
01:08:41,881 --> 01:08:42,714
- Huh?

999
01:08:45,381 --> 01:08:47,481
- I take it everything is fine.

1000
01:08:47,481 --> 01:08:49,648
- Please, Fletch, just leave me be, please.

1001
01:08:49,648 --> 01:08:51,081
- Did you take the laudanum?

1002
01:08:51,081 --> 01:08:52,847
- It didn't work.

1003
01:08:52,847 --> 01:08:54,081
- What do you mean it didn't work?

1004
01:08:54,081 --> 01:08:55,014
- [James] I still had the nightmares.

1005
01:08:55,014 --> 01:08:56,281
- Well, try more, take five.

1006
01:08:56,281 --> 01:08:57,314
- I took six.

1007
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:00,548
(horse whinnying)

1008
01:09:00,548 --> 01:09:03,281
(horse clopping)

1009
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,814
- Oh, my God, Jenkins didn't have

1010
01:09:12,814 --> 01:09:14,414
his head up his arse for once!

1011
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,181
I'm gonna go see what's happening.

1012
01:09:20,081 --> 01:09:20,914
You coming?

1013
01:09:22,014 --> 01:09:22,947
- No, thanks.

1014
01:09:22,947 --> 01:09:24,515
It's uh, it's not for me.

1015
01:09:24,515 --> 01:09:25,348
You have fun.

1016
01:09:27,381 --> 01:09:29,881
(tense music)

1017
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:37,548
(men chattering)

1018
01:09:40,281 --> 01:09:42,881
(lock clicks)

1019
01:09:42,881 --> 01:09:44,114
(knocking)

1020
01:09:44,114 --> 01:09:47,614
- [Policeman] Open the door, Portsmouth Police!

1021
01:09:51,348 --> 01:09:55,181
(men chattering outside door)

1022
01:09:56,981 --> 01:09:58,881
Open the door, Portsmouth Police!

1023
01:10:03,381 --> 01:10:04,747
(lock clicks)

1024
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:06,448
- We're looking for a man named James Farrow.

1025
01:10:06,448 --> 01:10:07,680
Do you know him?

1026
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,348
- [Man] His room is at the end of the hall.

1027
01:10:08,348 --> 01:10:09,314
- Thank you.

1028
01:10:11,947 --> 01:10:12,781
Farrow!

1029
01:10:12,781 --> 01:10:13,981
(knocking)

1030
01:10:13,981 --> 01:10:14,914
Open the door, Portsmouth Police.

1031
01:10:15,947 --> 01:10:17,214
Open the door, Farrow.

1032
01:10:19,181 --> 01:10:22,281
(knocking) Open the door!

1033
01:10:22,281 --> 01:10:25,548
(policemen chattering)

1034
01:10:46,981 --> 01:10:49,847
(thunder crashing)

1035
01:10:56,947 --> 01:10:59,647
(horse trotting)

1036
01:10:59,647 --> 01:11:01,214
- [James] Professor Ambrose.

1037
01:11:01,214 --> 01:11:02,481
- [Ambrose] Get on.

1038
01:11:02,481 --> 01:11:03,414
- [James] You don't realize the trouble

1039
01:11:03,414 --> 01:11:04,881
you're gonna be getting into.

1040
01:11:04,881 --> 01:11:06,481
- [Ambrose] Get on.

1041
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,547
(horse clopping)

1042
01:11:10,547 --> 01:11:11,847
Get up, get up, come on!

1043
01:11:11,847 --> 01:11:14,847
(suspenseful music)

1044
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:26,114
Thank you, sir. (coughing)

1045
01:11:36,181 --> 01:11:37,014
- There you go.

1046
01:11:37,014 --> 01:11:39,780
- (groans) Thank you.

1047
01:11:39,780 --> 01:11:40,614
- I should fetch a doctor.

1048
01:11:40,614 --> 01:11:41,914
- No, no, no, no.

1049
01:11:41,914 --> 01:11:43,047
No.

1050
01:11:43,047 --> 01:11:46,148
For me the end is the cure.

1051
01:11:46,148 --> 01:11:47,647
- Don't talk like that.

1052
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:49,248
There must be something I can do.

1053
01:11:50,381 --> 01:11:52,047
- You?

1054
01:11:52,047 --> 01:11:55,747
You did me a great service by listening to my story.

1055
01:11:55,747 --> 01:11:57,348
- Sir, if it's...

1056
01:11:57,348 --> 01:11:58,614
If it's money you need, I can--

1057
01:11:58,614 --> 01:11:59,414
- No.

1058
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:03,281
- You need someone to collect for you.

1059
01:12:03,281 --> 01:12:07,480
- Oh, no, no, quite the contrary. (coughing)

1060
01:12:09,148 --> 01:12:12,680
Mr. Farrow, please, listen to me.

1061
01:12:14,614 --> 01:12:17,547
Somehow, telling you of these things

1062
01:12:17,547 --> 01:12:21,580
has pulled the veil from my eyes.

1063
01:12:23,281 --> 01:12:24,414
And I have...

1064
01:12:24,414 --> 01:12:26,248
I have you to thank for that.

1065
01:12:28,181 --> 01:12:31,314
But now you, you shall have a chance.

1066
01:12:31,314 --> 01:12:33,981
For you it is not over yet.

1067
01:12:33,981 --> 01:12:37,414
Please do not pursue this obsession of yours.

1068
01:12:37,414 --> 01:12:41,480
- Sir, this is far too real to be any obsession.

1069
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:44,414
- Real or unreal, it doesn't matter.

1070
01:12:44,414 --> 01:12:48,348
Only you can rid yourself of this ghost.

1071
01:12:48,348 --> 01:12:49,847
Please.

1072
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:53,647
Please, do not make the same mistakes that I have.

1073
01:12:54,614 --> 01:12:56,714
Get out of this place.

1074
01:12:56,714 --> 01:12:58,480
You are not safe here.

1075
01:12:58,480 --> 01:13:01,614
- Sir, without this money you will die a pauper

1076
01:13:01,614 --> 01:13:02,881
and I've seen a pauper's burial

1077
01:13:02,881 --> 01:13:04,447
and I will not let that happen.

1078
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,480
I'm going to the house.

1079
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:08,081
- Fool, forget the house!

1080
01:13:08,081 --> 01:13:09,314
- I cannot.

1081
01:13:10,447 --> 01:13:11,981
- Let the past go.

1082
01:13:13,148 --> 01:13:15,514
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

1083
01:13:17,047 --> 01:13:18,381
Live, James.

1084
01:13:20,413 --> 01:13:21,647
Live.

1085
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:23,214
- I cannot spend my life running away.

1086
01:13:27,514 --> 01:13:28,714
It may not be the house,

1087
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:33,914
but it is most definitely what is inside.

1088
01:13:33,914 --> 01:13:36,480
(Amrose sighs)

1089
01:13:38,314 --> 01:13:39,647
She is waiting for me.

1090
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:43,647
I know that now.

1091
01:13:43,647 --> 01:13:44,680
- No.

1092
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:45,514
No.

1093
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:49,314
(dramatic music)

1094
01:14:23,014 --> 01:14:24,347
- [Sarah] James.

1095
01:14:41,248 --> 01:14:44,081
(horses trotting)

1096
01:14:52,580 --> 01:14:54,680
(rain falling)

1097
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:57,781
(muffled conversing)

1098
01:15:06,514 --> 01:15:07,881
- The house.

1099
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:08,881
- Of course.

1100
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,680
(door creaking)

1101
01:15:23,514 --> 01:15:26,114
(wind howling)

1102
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:50,347
(James gasps)

1103
01:15:50,347 --> 01:15:51,181
- Sarah?

1104
01:15:51,181 --> 01:15:52,014
- James.

1105
01:15:54,614 --> 01:15:55,614
- Don't drink the wine!

1106
01:15:55,614 --> 01:15:57,680
- [Sarah] Drink the wine.

1107
01:16:00,214 --> 01:16:01,680
Come to me, James.

1108
01:16:02,547 --> 01:16:03,380
Come to me.

1109
01:16:03,380 --> 01:16:04,214
- I'm with you now.

1110
01:16:06,313 --> 01:16:07,148
- Don't!

1111
01:16:07,148 --> 01:16:08,947
- Drink the wine, James.

1112
01:16:08,947 --> 01:16:09,781
Drink.

1113
01:16:11,714 --> 01:16:12,947
- [Woman] No, it's poisoned!

1114
01:16:13,881 --> 01:16:18,881
- Drink.

1115
01:16:22,881 --> 01:16:24,148
- Don't!

1116
01:16:24,148 --> 01:16:27,247
Don't you understand, don't drink it!

1117
01:16:34,547 --> 01:16:36,114
What have you done?

1118
01:16:48,547 --> 01:16:49,380
- Wait.

1119
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:51,514
Sarah!

1120
01:16:54,213 --> 01:16:56,047
Sarah, I thought...

1121
01:16:56,047 --> 01:16:58,914
(groaning)

1122
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:00,380
- [Lucy] Who are you?

1123
01:17:00,380 --> 01:17:01,213
- Sarah?

1124
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:04,347
- My father sent you here to do his bidding, didn't he?

1125
01:17:05,514 --> 01:17:06,881
- Lucy?

1126
01:17:06,881 --> 01:17:07,847
You're not a ghost.

1127
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,347
(groans) What have you given me?

1128
01:17:11,347 --> 01:17:12,747
- Poisoned it to keep him sick.

1129
01:17:12,747 --> 01:17:14,313
I had to raise the levels.

1130
01:17:14,313 --> 01:17:16,347
A person gains immunity over the years.

1131
01:17:16,347 --> 01:17:17,413
I have to fetch a doctor.

1132
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:18,247
- No!

1133
01:17:18,247 --> 01:17:19,081
All these years.

1134
01:17:20,881 --> 01:17:22,981
How can a man be so deceived?

1135
01:17:22,981 --> 01:17:24,247
- Look at you.

1136
01:17:24,247 --> 01:17:25,180
- But he said that you had the power

1137
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,847
to make him lose consciousness,

1138
01:17:26,847 --> 01:17:28,014
to break through locks.

1139
01:17:28,014 --> 01:17:30,114
- I drugged him with ether.

1140
01:17:30,114 --> 01:17:32,347
I loosened the screws in the locks.

1141
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:35,081
It's very easy when a man wants to believe.

1142
01:17:35,081 --> 01:17:36,847
- (scoffs) Why would you do this?

1143
01:17:37,780 --> 01:17:38,881
- You don't know my father.

1144
01:17:38,881 --> 01:17:40,447
- Yes, I do.

1145
01:17:40,447 --> 01:17:42,580
- No, you don't.

1146
01:17:42,580 --> 01:17:44,814
- Your father loves you, Lucy.

1147
01:17:44,814 --> 01:17:46,180
- Because of my father I lost

1148
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:48,213
the only man I've ever loved.

1149
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:50,680
- People make mistakes.

1150
01:17:51,847 --> 01:17:53,514
- You tell my father he can go to hell.

1151
01:17:54,413 --> 01:17:55,247
- Lucy!

1152
01:17:57,380 --> 01:17:59,247
Your father, you still have a chance.

1153
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,413
He's dying.

1154
01:18:01,413 --> 01:18:02,247
- Dying?

1155
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,514
(horse whinnying)

1156
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,614
(door slamming)

1157
01:18:15,614 --> 01:18:16,580
- We're looking for James Farrow.

1158
01:18:16,580 --> 01:18:19,313
(James groaning)

1159
01:18:21,814 --> 01:18:23,147
- Come on, then.

1160
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,180
Come on, now.

1161
01:18:32,714 --> 01:18:33,547
- Daddy?

1162
01:18:35,747 --> 01:18:36,580
Daddy.

1163
01:18:37,981 --> 01:18:40,814
(horses trotting)

1164
01:18:47,680 --> 01:18:50,447
(James groaning)

1165
01:18:52,347 --> 01:18:53,514
- Yeah, leave him.

1166
01:18:53,514 --> 01:18:56,280
(dramatic music)

1167
01:19:00,014 --> 01:19:03,046
(cell door shutting)

1168
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:05,447
Belong to you?

1169
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:10,313
- I never meant to hurt her.

1170
01:19:10,313 --> 01:19:13,380
- That may be, but the girl didn't have to die.

1171
01:19:15,947 --> 01:19:17,213
- I'm so sorry.

1172
01:19:17,213 --> 01:19:18,614
- It's too late, I'm afraid.

1173
01:19:20,814 --> 01:19:21,847
I'm done here.

1174
01:19:21,847 --> 01:19:22,881
Get this man a doctor.

1175
01:19:22,881 --> 01:19:24,747
- [Tilton] I'm a doctor.

1176
01:19:24,747 --> 01:19:25,580
- [Ryan] Let him see the boy.

1177
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,547
(James groaning)

1178
01:19:27,547 --> 01:19:28,981
- [James] No, no.

1179
01:19:37,714 --> 01:19:39,080
- I'm all you got.

1180
01:19:39,080 --> 01:19:41,847
- (groaning) No!

1181
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:46,814
Ah!

1182
01:19:49,180 --> 01:19:52,113
- Arsenic poisoning, there's nothing to do.

1183
01:19:52,113 --> 01:19:53,447
Poison'll do more damage coming out

1184
01:19:53,447 --> 01:19:55,080
than it did going in.

1185
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:57,280
(James grunting)

1186
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:58,313
You'll just have to let the poison

1187
01:19:58,313 --> 01:20:00,080
run its course, sonny.

1188
01:20:00,080 --> 01:20:01,914
It'll work its way out.

1189
01:20:01,914 --> 01:20:04,447
In a day or so, you'll be right as rain.

1190
01:20:04,447 --> 01:20:06,147
Up to your old tricks in no time.

1191
01:20:07,213 --> 01:20:08,046
Or you won't.

1192
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,213
(James groaning)

1193
01:20:14,113 --> 01:20:15,180
- Get him out of here!

1194
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:16,547
- You can't treat me like this!

1195
01:20:16,547 --> 01:20:18,313
I'm a surgeon!

1196
01:20:18,313 --> 01:20:19,413
I'm a doctor!

1197
01:20:22,247 --> 01:20:25,080
(Tilton shouting)

1198
01:20:28,046 --> 01:20:29,614
Damn you!

1199
01:20:29,614 --> 01:20:31,013
I am a surgeon, I demand respect!

1200
01:20:33,647 --> 01:20:34,480
Damn you!

1201
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:39,080
- [Ryan] I'm sorry, son.

1202
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:42,614
(cell door slamming)

1203
01:20:42,614 --> 01:20:45,313
(fire crackling)

1204
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,946
(Lucy crying)

1205
01:21:11,913 --> 01:21:14,247
- [Ambrose] Where's my rent?

1206
01:21:16,514 --> 01:21:19,413
- (crying) Father?

1207
01:21:19,413 --> 01:21:21,013
(house exploding)

1208
01:21:21,013 --> 01:21:23,747
(Lucy screaming)

1209
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,680
(James gagging)

1210
01:21:53,013 --> 01:21:54,046
- Forgive me.

1211
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:02,380
(dramatic music)

1212
01:22:25,846 --> 01:22:27,080
- [Tilton] I'm a surgeon!

1213
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:28,247
I'm a surgeon!

1214
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:34,880
(Tilton shouting)

1215
01:22:35,814 --> 01:22:38,547
(mournful music)

1216
01:22:40,647 --> 01:22:42,380
You killed this woman!

1217
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:43,946
(shouting) You!

1218
01:22:43,946 --> 01:22:46,781
(Tilton shouting)

1219
01:22:50,813 --> 01:22:53,580
(dramatic music)
