1
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,539
Fell to earth.

2
00:00:05,606 --> 00:00:08,909
The fallen star burned
as an eternal light

3
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:10,711
And ultimate source
of power,

4
00:00:10,778 --> 00:00:14,582
Which became known
as the viridian flame.

5
00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:17,718
From this flame
emerged two races.

6
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:21,855
First, the reptilian beasts,
defenders of the flame,

7
00:00:21,922 --> 00:00:23,157
Then the elves,

8
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,059
Each in possession
of an amulet

9
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,927
Containing
the flame's power.

10
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:29,597
Some resolved
to remain isolated,

11
00:00:29,663 --> 00:00:31,599
Guarding the flame
where it fell,

12
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,368
Deep in the mountains
of northfalia.

13
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:38,739
Most chose to live
among the humans,

14
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:40,741
In hope of a better life.

15
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:44,712
But the humans have begun
to enslave the elves

16
00:00:44,778 --> 00:00:48,116
And exploit their gifts.

17
00:00:48,182 --> 00:00:50,918
There are murmurs
that this is the beginning

18
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,854
Of the great prophecy.

19
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:56,724
It tells
of a mighty luminary

20
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:01,562
Who will rise
in an era of great turmoil.

21
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:05,433
This is where
our story begins.

22
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,611
Guards, this way!

23
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:26,220
Beasley, I do not see
any deer.

24
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,158
They must have got away.

25
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:32,593
We wandered over the border
into northfalia.

26
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:34,728
Let's return.

27
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,630
It's only for sport, sire.

28
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:37,965
Let us pursue the deer.

29
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:40,234
No, the beasts
run free here.

30
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:42,836
It's not safe, nor is it
true to our treaty.

31
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,138
Come.

32
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:46,507
[Fierce roar,
horse whinnies]

33
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,133
Beasley!

34
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,137
Beasley!

35
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:19,840
Beasley...

36
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,799
[Crying]

37
00:02:50,371 --> 00:02:53,307
It simply cannot be true.

38
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,576
How is it possible?

39
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:13,961
It simply cannot be true.

40
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:16,397
How is it possible?

41
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,772
Much better.

42
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:43,324
Thee I invoke
by the moonlit sea,

43
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:47,761
The standing stone,
and the twisted tree.

44
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,702
Mirror, mirror, on the wall,

45
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:57,037
Who is fairest
of them all?

46
00:03:57,104 --> 00:04:00,574
You are, my queen.

47
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,480
Isabella?

48
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:10,217
Has the prince
of northfalia arrived?

49
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,919
No, madam.

50
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,356
It is quite some distance
from the northfalian throne.

51
00:04:21,462 --> 00:04:23,263
You still refuse to confess

52
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:25,599
That the flame
is on the prince's land?

53
00:04:26,967 --> 00:04:28,569
As I've said before,

54
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,672
The flame is only
a myth, madam.

55
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:39,413
[Urinating]

56
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,686
Aah!

57
00:04:46,654 --> 00:04:48,121
What is a hunter
from whitevale

58
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,323
Doing on my lands?

59
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:51,158
Your land?

60
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:53,561
Oh, I'm very sorry, sire.

61
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,896
I was hunting the beasts
at the order of the queen.

62
00:04:55,963 --> 00:05:01,168
Hunting on northfalian land
is considered an act of war.

63
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,604
Apologies, sir.
It was all innocent.

64
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,639
Go back to your kingdom.

65
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,875
And pull your trousers up,
for heaven's sake.

66
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,443
Yes, sire.

67
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,747
A harmless mistake, sire?

68
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:17,485
No. It is not a day
since the death of the king,

69
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,353
And already they violate
our peace treaty.

70
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:21,355
We cannot afford
another war, sire.

71
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,491
I know.

72
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:26,960
So I must find a way to
make peace with the queen

73
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,829
That is more lasting.

74
00:05:28,896 --> 00:05:30,398
So it is to be
a marriage, then.

75
00:05:30,464 --> 00:05:32,700
Whitevale
covets our land

76
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,935
And we have not
the resources
to fight them off.

77
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:37,805
It seems beneficial
for both kingdoms.

78
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:42,776
[Running footsteps]

79
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:53,086
[Panting breaths]

80
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,557
[Roaring, snarling]

81
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,563
[Screaming]

82
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:08,702
Sire, your leadership
is impressive,

83
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,404
But what of your happiness?

84
00:06:10,471 --> 00:06:12,205
My happiness?

85
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:16,677
Do you not want to find love,
like your parents did?

86
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:18,946
I must do what is right
for the kingdom.

87
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,925
Sire?

88
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:09,530
The queen is waiting.

89
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,941
My queen.

90
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:24,612
His royal highness,
price Alexander of northfalia.

91
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,959
I am truly sorry
for your loss.

92
00:07:39,026 --> 00:07:42,796
It is indeed
a great loss for us all.

93
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:47,100
It simply
cannot be true.

94
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:48,902
How is it possible?

95
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,106
Those awful beasts.

96
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,776
I have sent my men out
to kill them all.

97
00:07:56,777 --> 00:07:58,045
Yes, your highness.

98
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,081
We found one of your men
on the way here

99
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,983
On northfalian land.

100
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,585
That's a dreadful
mistake.

101
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:07,387
Though, of course, if
you would like our help

102
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,556
Eradicating those beasts
from your land,

103
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,990
You have but to ask.

104
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:11,324
Thank you, but no.

105
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:13,260
In my kingdom,
we must live in harmony

106
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,062
With all our creatures.

107
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,667
I'm just so pleased
that the dear king

108
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,134
Had a chance to sign
the peace treaty

109
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,670
Before he died.

110
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:25,539
And yet,
somehow I wonder

111
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:28,742
If it will hold...

112
00:08:28,809 --> 00:08:31,144
Without the king himself
here to uphold it.

113
00:08:33,814 --> 00:08:38,318
Perhaps if we were
to consider...

114
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,554
A union
of both our kingdoms.

115
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:49,229
The audacity.

116
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,201
You dare speak to me
of marriage

117
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,203
While my dear king
lies nearly still warm.

118
00:08:56,269 --> 00:08:57,705
I meant no offense.

119
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:00,307
Please forgive me.

120
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:04,878
Sir, I do understand

121
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:07,080
The reasoning behind
your sudden proposal.

122
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,784
However, I cannot
consider it here...

123
00:09:11,785 --> 00:09:14,154
Not on this day.

124
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:20,193
Perhaps you would be
our guest here at whitevale

125
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:24,464
Where we might discuss it
more fully in the coming days.

126
00:09:24,531 --> 00:09:27,500
It would be my pleasure.

127
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,904
Snow white,
princess of whitevale.

128
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,621
Snow, dear,
welcome home.

129
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,491
You are the queen's
daughter?

130
00:09:51,558 --> 00:09:53,727
Step-daughter.

131
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:55,495
Of course.

132
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:57,765
It is an honor,
princess.

133
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,401
Well, I'm sure
you must be very tired.

134
00:10:01,468 --> 00:10:02,636
You've had a long trip.

135
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:05,305
Oh, you've been
traveling? Abroad?

136
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:07,240
I have been at the convent.

137
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,177
A nun?

138
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,613
No. I have not yet
felt the calling.

139
00:10:16,383 --> 00:10:20,620
Sire, we should retire.

140
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:32,666
[Door opens]

141
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:50,183
Thee I invoke
by the moonlit sea,

142
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,320
The standing stone,
and the twisted tree.

143
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:57,257
Mirror, mirror,
on the wall,

144
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,659
Who is the fairest
of them all?

145
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:03,530
My queen, you are
full fair, 'tis true,

146
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:05,398
But there is one
in the kingdom

147
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,101
More fair than you...

148
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:09,302
Snow white.

149
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:10,971
It cannot be.

150
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,918
It will not be.

151
00:11:27,087 --> 00:11:30,290
[Night birds calling,
crickets chirp]

152
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:45,138
[Humming]

153
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,477
[Humming continues]

154
00:11:57,985 --> 00:11:59,252
Oh!

155
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,622
[Laughs quietly]
I'm sorry, princess.

156
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:04,357
I didn't mean to disturb you.

157
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:08,028
No. Uh...
I should go.

158
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:11,298
No, no, no.
Please, you stay. I'll...

159
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,971
How is it I haven't
known you before?

160
00:12:18,038 --> 00:12:20,774
The queen sent me
to a convent

161
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,242
When I was
a little girl.

162
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:24,845
Soon after
she married my father.

163
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:26,713
And now
your father's gone,

164
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,748
You must be needed here.

165
00:12:28,816 --> 00:12:33,686
No. The convent
is my home now.

166
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,356
There's nothing
for me here.

167
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,495
The most wonderful thing
about whitevale

168
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,497
Was once the forest.

169
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:48,068
I would visit often
when I was a little girl.

170
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:53,073
But now the forest
offers no solace.

171
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,343
It is lonely and barren

172
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:58,645
Now the queen
has gotten rid of the elves.

173
00:12:58,711 --> 00:13:00,981
My forests
are enchanted still

174
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,817
And home to a great many
elves and beasts.

175
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,819
My mother
used to tell me a story

176
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,287
About the northfalian forest

177
00:13:07,354 --> 00:13:09,589
In which a star
fell from the heavens

178
00:13:09,656 --> 00:13:10,991
And landed deep
in the forest,

179
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,993
Where no human
had ever set foot.

180
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,995
And from that star

181
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:17,130
Sprang the elves
and all their magic,

182
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:19,332
As well as the beasts
who guard them.

183
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,769
And that one day
a mighty luminary

184
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:24,571
Would unite all creatures

185
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,174
For a thousand years
of harmony.

186
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:36,516
Princess,
I would be delighted

187
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,251
To have you as a guest.

188
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:44,925
Would you walk with me
tomorrow at noon?

189
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,362
I don't know what to say.

190
00:13:57,804 --> 00:13:59,940
This ring
was my mother's.

191
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,211
I would like you
to have it

192
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:06,947
As a token
of my great esteem.

193
00:14:09,449 --> 00:14:10,951
Please.

194
00:14:14,554 --> 00:14:16,924
Until we meet again.

195
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,259
Tomorrow at noon.

196
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:36,843
Awake.

197
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,845
You did such
a brilliant job with the king,

198
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:41,814
I have another task.

199
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,483
Yes, my queen?

200
00:14:47,154 --> 00:14:49,522
Queen: Snow white.

201
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,924
Is something wrong?

202
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,193
No, my dear,
not yet, thank heavens,

203
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,063
But you've had a very
close call with danger.

204
00:14:57,430 --> 00:14:59,299
I could not help
but note the passion

205
00:14:59,366 --> 00:15:01,901
The young prince
excited in your eyes.

206
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,338
Your father
was so pleased

207
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,440
To have you
at the convent,

208
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:08,708
And I would feel it
an abandonment

209
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,143
Of my responsibility
to him

210
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,545
If I were to allow you
to squander your virtue

211
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:16,583
On some fleeting
feelings of lust.

212
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,985
But I would never...

213
00:15:18,051 --> 00:15:19,586
No, my dear...

214
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:21,989
No, you must do
as you wish.

215
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:24,391
Not all girls are made
for the convent.

216
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:27,694
No, uh...

217
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,662
I'm grateful
for your concern.

218
00:15:31,531 --> 00:15:34,767
I shall honor my father
and remain virtuous.

219
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,436
Wonderful.

220
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:40,207
Let's get you back to
the convent immediately.

221
00:15:50,883 --> 00:15:52,352
Goodbye, dear.

222
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,124
Take her to the
northfalian wildwoods.

223
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,526
Leave her body
for the beasts,

224
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:01,628
But bring me her heart.

225
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,553
The queen's men.

226
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:31,991
We'll take a shortcut
through here.

227
00:16:32,059 --> 00:16:34,127
Is this not
the prince's land?

228
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,029
No, miss,
it's just the border.

229
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,030
Through here.

230
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,698
Just a moment.

231
00:16:44,371 --> 00:16:47,340
Um... Perhaps we should
stay on the path.

232
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,676
No, miss, this way's
much, much quicker.

233
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:50,877
No, I insist.

234
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,345
I would feel much safer.

235
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:55,014
Well, if you wanna make
this more difficult.

236
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,583
What?

237
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,551
Aah!

238
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,560
[Roaring]
Uhh!

239
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,805
[Screaming]

240
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,612
Is it done?
Yes.

241
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:06,619
[Growling and snarling]

242
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:19,266
[Snarling and barking]

243
00:18:27,674 --> 00:18:30,910
Sire, where are you headed
with such purpose?

244
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:32,279
I must learn my fate, Hugh.

245
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,813
I'm going to propose
to snow white,

246
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,215
For I cannot imagine

247
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:37,217
Spending another day
of my life without her.

248
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,385
For love?
But you told me...

249
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:39,852
Indeed, for love, Hugh.

250
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,255
I'm going to marry for love
and for the kingdom.

251
00:18:42,322 --> 00:18:44,457
Our union
will join our people

252
00:18:44,524 --> 00:18:47,494
And our lands,
it's perfect.

253
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:53,032
And have you noticed
what a beautiful day it is?

254
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:55,268
The perfect day
for an engagement.

255
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:57,837
But what about your
engagement to the queen?

256
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:02,175
She refused me, Hugh,
thank the heavens,

257
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:05,178
For the fates
had another in mind for me.

258
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:08,348
But, sire, it was not
a complete refusal.

259
00:20:13,513 --> 00:20:16,516
My love has been taken.

260
00:20:52,352 --> 00:20:54,454
She's alive.

261
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,564
[Voices,
metal clanging]

262
00:21:24,651 --> 00:21:27,854
Woman: There's
much darkness ahead.

263
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,196
You dare bring
a human in here.

264
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,865
She's injured.

265
00:21:44,904 --> 00:21:47,006
Who is she?

266
00:21:49,342 --> 00:21:51,944
Oh, that's quite deep.
Put her down.

267
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:55,782
Can you heal her
before Orlando returns?

268
00:21:55,848 --> 00:21:58,885
No. This will
take me some time.

269
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,453
Orlando.

270
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:41,561
She needs my help,
Orlando.

271
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:46,365
We do not help humans.

272
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:49,001
Take her out to the woods
far away from here

273
00:22:49,068 --> 00:22:50,537
And leave her.

274
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:51,904
But the queen's men
will find her

275
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,305
And they'll try
to kill her again.

276
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:55,274
The queen's men
tried to kill her,

277
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:56,843
And yet
you brought her here?

278
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,179
I ought to slice her throat
and be done with it.

279
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,848
She saved
the runt's life.

280
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,217
So this was your doing,
half-human.

281
00:23:05,284 --> 00:23:06,886
Woman: Orlando.

282
00:23:14,661 --> 00:23:16,696
Here, drink this.

283
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:29,041
As soon as she's recovered,
she will leave.

284
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,011
I want her gone
by sunset.

285
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,425
Isabella,
I have a headache.

286
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:13,686
I need only tug this amulet
from your throat,

287
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:17,223
And all your magic
will be mine.

288
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:22,461
It's amusing, is it not?

289
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:24,664
Yes, madam.

290
00:24:24,731 --> 00:24:26,465
But your powers
are so meager.

291
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,734
And what good
would taking one more

292
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,737
Of these
elfin flames do me?

293
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:34,473
No, it is not the power
in these dribs and drabs

294
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:36,709
That I want.

295
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:39,879
It is the source...

296
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:42,915
The flame
from the fallen star.

297
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,621
No matter. It is
on the prince's land.

298
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:50,456
And when I marry the prince,

299
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:53,192
It will be mine
for all eternity.

300
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,262
You can go.

301
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:10,142
Thee I invoke
by the moonlit sea,

302
00:25:10,209 --> 00:25:14,213
The standing stone
and the twisted tree.

303
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,415
Mirror, mirror,
on the wall,

304
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,151
Who is the fairest
of them all?

305
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,989
My queen, you are
still fair, 'tis true,

306
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:26,993
But snow white
is fairer still than you.

307
00:25:28,561 --> 00:25:30,162
It cannot be.

308
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:34,767
He showed me her heart.

309
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:44,611
Bring me the huntsman.

310
00:25:56,823 --> 00:26:00,392
Wally, you must go.

311
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:02,328
Here. Take this.

312
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:04,263
But father...

313
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,497
Please leave now,

314
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,233
Or the queen
will kill you as well.

315
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,500
And you must remember

316
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,737
That I did not kill
anybody.

317
00:26:10,803 --> 00:26:12,404
The queen asked it of me.

318
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,807
Kill who?
Run!

319
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,075
Go!

320
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,850
Aah! Aah!

321
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,653
I took her to the north hill
like you said.

322
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,788
And then a green light
blinded me

323
00:26:28,855 --> 00:26:30,522
Just as I was
about to finish her.

324
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,124
A green light
near the north hill?

325
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:35,194
Please, please,
give me another chance,

326
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:38,197
And I'll find her
and kill her

327
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:39,832
For you.

328
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,801
You've had your chance,

329
00:26:41,868 --> 00:26:43,235
And you lied to me
about it.

330
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:46,572
Finish up here, and then
give him to the dogs.

331
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:48,808
I prefer to finish
what I started.

332
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:53,379
Aaaaah!
No! No!

333
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,048
Aah! No! No!

334
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,620
[Dogs snarl and grunt]

335
00:27:01,688 --> 00:27:04,090
[Huntsman screams]

336
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:09,428
Queen: Be discreet
in your search.

337
00:27:09,495 --> 00:27:12,699
No one must know
she's alive.

338
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,334
Make it look
as though you were there

339
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,336
To kill
the reptilian beasts

340
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,071
As our favor to the prince.

341
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:22,074
Yes, madam, and how
will we find her?

342
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:25,644
You'll begin
by asking the elves.

343
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:28,881
And you do not need
to ask nicely.

344
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,262
Her fever has broken.

345
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:44,596
[Door opens]

346
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,866
The queen's men
are all over the forest.

347
00:27:46,933 --> 00:27:49,001
They're looking
for a human girl.

348
00:27:49,068 --> 00:27:50,870
Who is she?

349
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:52,038
This is not
the first time

350
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,539
The queen is after
an innocent.

351
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:54,774
Still, we must
give her to them.

352
00:27:54,841 --> 00:27:57,910
No, if they
want her dead,

353
00:27:57,977 --> 00:27:59,912
They will not look kindly
on us healing her.

354
00:27:59,979 --> 00:28:02,081
They're headed towards
the greengate woods.

355
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,950
We must warn
our brothers there.

356
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,451
Wait!

357
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:07,754
Where do you think
you're going?

358
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,388
Out with you?

359
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,860
Or not.

360
00:28:13,926 --> 00:28:15,294
We need you here

361
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:17,129
To guard the cottage
and look after the girl.

362
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:20,032
I would not trust
anyone to it but you.

363
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:25,805
And do not let her
take one step outside

364
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,040
Or I will
cut off your ears.

365
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:12,919
Aah! Help!

366
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:15,587
Help! Help!
Please!

367
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:16,722
Tell us
where she is.

368
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,490
Where's the girl?

369
00:29:18,557 --> 00:29:20,592
I do not know a girl.

370
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:23,262
Liars. Elves
are all liars.

371
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:25,497
Where is the girl?

372
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,099
Not at
the queen's guard.

373
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,902
It will be
an act of war.

374
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,303
There is your act of war.

375
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,539
[Sword unsheaths,
arrow whooshes]

376

[Guard groans]

377
00:29:35,341 --> 00:29:36,876
Hey!

378
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,284
Aah!

379
00:29:47,854 --> 00:29:51,123
[Rumbling]

380
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,901
Aaaah!

381
00:30:13,079 --> 00:30:16,015
My lord, please.
Come inside.

382
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,085
You must eat.

383
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:23,289
It's my fault
she's gone, Hugh.

384
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:27,927
They were beasts
from my forests.

385
00:30:27,994 --> 00:30:29,896
The queen has
taken it upon herself

386
00:30:29,962 --> 00:30:32,398
To eliminate those
creatures now, sire.

387
00:30:32,464 --> 00:30:34,566
You must get hold
of yourself.

388
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:36,268
You owe it
to your subjects

389
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,771
To marry someone who
will provide benefits

390
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,707
For the entire kingdom.

391
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:46,378
Please, Hugh,
it is still too fresh.

392
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,048
I cannot consider
such things now.

393
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:53,252
The widow queen
is a perfect match.

394
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:57,156
I need some air.

395
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,060
She will not wait
forever.

[Hearth fire crackling]

397

Where am I?

398
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,530
I have no time to chat.

399
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,135
If I don't get
the mending done,

400
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,503
They call me stupid
and lazy,

401
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:47,273
And they'll never let me
go out with them.

402
00:31:49,675 --> 00:31:51,810
Sorry. Who are you?

403
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:55,948
Runt. That's what
everyone calls me.

404
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:59,918
Oh, I'd much prefer to
call you by your name.

405
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:02,388
Really?

406
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:06,692
Well, my given name
is haegthorn.

407
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:10,162
Oh, a noble
and sturdy plant.

408
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,933
I apologize.

409
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:18,437
I can't seem
to remember anything.

410
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:19,471
Leave me to my work.

411
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,007
I'm stuck here
when I should be out

412
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,641

of the queen's guard.

[Door opens
and closes sharply]

Haegthorn?

416
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:35,988
Haegthorn?

417

Haegthorn?

Haegthorn?

419
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,401
I must go now.

420
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:08,820
Where is she?

421
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,090
Have you brought me
my step-daughter?

422
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:12,458
No, madam.

423
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:15,594
We have been unable
to locate her as yet.

424
00:33:15,661 --> 00:33:18,830
The elves we have found
claim to know nothing.

425
00:33:18,897 --> 00:33:22,101
They are very tricky,
your highness.

426
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,873
Unleash the dogs.

427

[Dog yelps]

should be satisfied.

to leave.

Yaah!

452
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,409
I finished
the dishes.

453
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:33,078
Is that the prince
of northfalia?

454
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,347
Notify the queen.

455
00:38:36,382 --> 00:38:39,585
Sire, are you all right?

456
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,021
Come!

457
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,356
No, no. This way.

458
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:46,024
I must find her.

459
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,441
There.
An elves' dwelling.

460
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:13,585
Open for prince Alexander.

461
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,726
You have wandered far,
prince.

462
00:39:20,792 --> 00:39:22,327
Kneel before
your prince.

463
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,396
That's enough.

464
00:39:24,463 --> 00:39:25,997
We mean you no harm.

465
00:39:26,064 --> 00:39:27,866
Go.

466
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:38,944
Perhaps if you tell us
what you seek, my lord.

467
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:40,979
I'm looking for a girl.

468
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:42,448
I saw her
not too far from here.

469
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:44,149
She was with
a runt-sized elf.

470
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,618
There are no humans here.

471
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:01,733
Snow.

472
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,101
Snow.

473
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,707
I'm sorry.

474
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:25,824
The prince is now
allied with the queen.

475
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:30,228
He allows her to roam
freely on his lands.

476
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:33,899
Soon she will claim
what it is she truly seeks...

477
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:36,468
The viridian flame.

478
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:38,737
It will be
the end of us all.

479
00:40:50,549 --> 00:40:52,050
Speak, captain.

480
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:54,119
Have the dogs found
my step-daughter?

481
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:56,555
For I am sure you would not
return here without her.

482
00:40:56,622 --> 00:40:58,423
I'm sorry, madam.
We have not.

483
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,859
And the prince ordered
us off his lands.

484
00:41:00,926 --> 00:41:02,293
He no longer
desires your help

485
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:05,196
In ridding the forest
of the beasts.

486
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:08,199
Well...

487
00:41:08,266 --> 00:41:10,736
We'll just have to be
a little more discreet.

488
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,806
I do not believe the elves

489
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:17,475
Are as ignorant in this
matter as they claim.

490
00:41:20,078 --> 00:41:22,013
Kidnap an elf.

491
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,882
Yes, madam.

492
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:28,153
And, madam, the prince...

493
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,222
He swears he saw snow white
in the forest

494
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:33,859
With an elf, a runt elf.

495
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:35,694
He saw her?

496
00:41:39,665 --> 00:41:41,266
I must go to him
at once.

497
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:47,606
Orlando, what you speak
is madness.

498
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,975
We cannot win in a fight
against the queen.

499
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,810
Our numbers
have dwindled too far.

500
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:54,646
And yet you would have
them dwindle further.

501
00:41:54,713 --> 00:41:56,648
The dark elves
were right all along.

502
00:41:56,715 --> 00:41:59,818
We never should have
trusted humans.

503
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:01,587
We should have
remained isolated

504
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:03,154
As they have.

505
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,422
But Orlando,
the queen

506
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:05,657
Will not be able
to acquire the flame

507
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:07,192
Of the fallen star.

508
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:08,359
The beasts who
guard it will not
allow her near.

509
00:42:08,426 --> 00:42:10,095
The queen will not stop

510
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,530
Until she has the viridian
flame as her own.

511
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:16,167
And with it,
all our powers...

512
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,004
For all eternity.

513
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:21,773
Orlando, you will need
permission to go to war,

514
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,541
And the keepers
will not approve it.

515
00:42:23,609 --> 00:42:24,810
They never have.

516
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,177
It has never been
as urgent as this.

517
00:42:26,244 --> 00:42:27,713
Orlando!

518
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,020
So there is a flame
from a fallen star.

519
00:42:35,086 --> 00:42:37,155
As in the legend.

520
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:39,324
Everyone out, please.
I need to think.

521
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:47,666
Mara, I must
speak with you.

522
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:49,200
The prince is a good man.

523
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:50,902
I cannot imagine that
he would allow the queen

524
00:42:50,969 --> 00:42:53,071
To destroy you
or your homes.

525
00:42:53,138 --> 00:42:54,405
He can help you.

526
00:42:54,472 --> 00:42:55,807
He came here today

527
00:42:55,874 --> 00:42:57,542
Accompanied by
the queen's guard.

528
00:42:57,609 --> 00:42:58,944
He has already
allowed her soldiers

529
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:01,079
To begin torturing
and killing elves.

530
00:43:01,146 --> 00:43:03,514
Well, then that must be
a misunderstanding.

531
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,051
Please, allow me
to speak with him.

532
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:08,119
We can prevent
more bloodshed.

533
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,187
And you will what,

534
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:10,255
Just walk into
his palace

535
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,222
And ask
for an audience?

536
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:13,158
He will see me.

537
00:43:18,697 --> 00:43:21,032
Who are you?

538
00:43:22,567 --> 00:43:24,369
I am snow white,

539
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,371
Princess of whitevale.

540
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,655
It is
a dangerous mission.

541
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:21,626
I would not ask it
of an elf

542
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,795
If he does not wish it.

543
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:32,137
I will go alone, then.

544
00:44:37,843 --> 00:44:39,745
I will go.

545
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:25,323
[Speaking elvish]

546
00:45:51,917 --> 00:45:55,120
They refused
the call to war.

547
00:45:55,186 --> 00:45:57,823
Only the prince
can help us now.

548
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:53,411
[Palace guards talking,
indistinct]

549
00:47:14,299 --> 00:47:16,601
Queen: Please do not
talk that way.

550
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:19,037
It is grief that caused
your vision of snow white.

551
00:47:19,104 --> 00:47:22,040
In fact, I myself
often see my dear king

552
00:47:22,107 --> 00:47:24,042
As though he were
right here with me,

553
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:25,610
Alive as you are.

554
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,212
But it was so real.

555
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:30,548
You must not allow
this madness to consume you,

556
00:47:30,615 --> 00:47:32,417
For the good of your realm.

557
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:36,487
I have decided
that you were correct.

558
00:47:36,554 --> 00:47:40,725
Our union is the best thing
for both of our kingdoms...

559
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:43,261
And your health.

560
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:49,935
Stop in the name
of the queen!

561
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,478
Haegthorn:
This way.

562
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,284
Snow white:
We can't outrun them.

563
00:48:06,351 --> 00:48:08,453
This way. Run!

564
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:10,922
Hey, over here!

565
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,200
Hyah!

566
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:23,301
Oof!

567
00:48:44,055 --> 00:48:45,356
[Arrow whooshes]

568
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:58,970
[Ropes whipping]

569
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:09,680
[Knock on door]

570
00:49:11,582 --> 00:49:13,151
Madam?

571
00:49:13,218 --> 00:49:15,353
We have caught an elf
near your carriage

572
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,522
Outside the prince's
castle this night.

573
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:20,291
Well done, captain.

574
00:49:20,358 --> 00:49:23,028
He's a little elf,
madam.

575
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:26,197
As in the prince's vision.

576
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:28,133
He's unconscious now.

577
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:30,635
We'll alert you
when he awakes.

578
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,237
You may stay.

579
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:02,333
[Panting, breathless]

580
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,503
Poor haegthorn.

581
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:06,704
I am to blame.

582
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,373
Orlando:
Yes, you are.

583
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,110
We must not fight
amongst ourselves.

584
00:50:12,177 --> 00:50:13,478
We should attack.

585
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:14,945
Gather all the elves
and storm the castle.

586
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,414
Even with all the elves
of the forest,

587
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:18,083
We could not defeat
the queen's army.

588
00:50:18,149 --> 00:50:19,984
What we need is someone
inside the castle.

589
00:50:20,051 --> 00:50:21,219
If only the runt
or someone

590
00:50:21,286 --> 00:50:23,088
Could tell us
what she's planning.

591
00:50:23,154 --> 00:50:25,490
Wait. Is tomorrow
the new moon?

592
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:26,624
Yes.

593
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,259
Well, then today's
market day.

594
00:50:28,326 --> 00:50:30,361
Our kind is at risk
of annihilation,

595
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,797
And you want
to go to market?

596
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:36,401
Isabella will be there making
purchases for the queen.

597
00:50:36,467 --> 00:50:38,369
Perhaps she will be
our informant.

598
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:41,005
She's on the side
of the queen.

599
00:50:41,072 --> 00:50:42,507
She's not one of us.

600
00:50:47,612 --> 00:50:49,080
We shall try it.

601
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:56,087
Guard:
Her majesty the queen.

602
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:03,894
Do not be afraid,
little elf.

603
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,163
We're not going
to hurt you.

604
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,165
I wish only to talk.

605
00:51:07,232 --> 00:51:09,066
Now, I know
you've been keeping company

606
00:51:09,134 --> 00:51:11,001
With my step-daughter
snow white.

607
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,570
No.

608
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:16,006
Your charms
won't work on me.

609
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,342
I'm an elf, not a man.

610
00:51:17,408 --> 00:51:20,778
Oh, but I do see
a bit of a man in there.

611
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,348
I know you were with her.

612
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:26,284
You were spotted
by the prince.

613
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:31,656
You want to tell me.

614
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,626
No...

615
00:51:40,565 --> 00:51:43,268
She's in the cottage,
your highness.

616
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:46,171
The cottage? Where?

617
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:49,274
Near swallow pond.

618
00:51:51,176 --> 00:51:53,211
Good little elf.

619
00:51:54,379 --> 00:51:56,013
Keep him alive for now.

620
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,349
I might need more
from him later.

621
00:52:05,656 --> 00:52:07,225
Oh, no.

622
00:52:09,026 --> 00:52:10,795
Forgive me, princess.

623
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,578
Make it strong,
Isabella.

624
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:28,546
Yes, madam.

625
00:52:28,613 --> 00:52:30,815
I want it
to kill her slowly.

626
00:52:30,881 --> 00:52:32,717
Yes, madam.

627
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,719
Slip it on her finger,

628
00:52:34,785 --> 00:52:36,987
And she will fall
unconscious in moments.

629
00:52:37,054 --> 00:52:40,858
From there,
she shall never awake.

630
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:44,929
Make this a sapphire.

631
00:53:04,615 --> 00:53:06,317
Perfect.

632
00:53:10,855 --> 00:53:15,760
Now... Turn me into a crone.

633
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:44,589
Monster.

634
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,805
I feel like the queen
knows you're alive.

635
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,707
Maybe this was
a mistake. Let's go.

636
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,242
Mara, please.

637
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,845
I must speak to Isabella.

638
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:52,690
Isabella.

639
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:55,960
You have abandoned
your kind

640
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,063
For the comfort
of the queen's good graces.

641
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,631
Now I implore you.

642
00:55:00,698 --> 00:55:03,233
Will you join with
your brethren to liberate...

643
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,669
The whitevale throne
is one of honor,

644
00:55:04,735 --> 00:55:06,371
And the queen
a person of beauty.

645
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,005
How can you
turn your back on all...

646
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:10,307
Long live
the good queen.

647
00:55:12,343 --> 00:55:14,078
Orlando, wait.

648
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:23,320
Rings for sale.

649
00:55:23,388 --> 00:55:24,522
No, thank you.

650
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:26,090
Oh, but look
how lovely they are.

651
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,425
No...
Look.

652
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:35,265
Where did...

653
00:55:35,332 --> 00:55:37,568
It was meant just for you...

654
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:48,579
Snow white.

655
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:45,770
Goodbye, princess.

656
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,762
Your highness,

657
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:14,331
New horses
will be delivered tomorrow.

658
00:57:14,398 --> 00:57:15,466
That's fine, Hugh.

659
00:57:15,533 --> 00:57:16,767
I received word.

660
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,003
The wedding will be
in two days' time.

661
00:57:22,473 --> 00:57:23,574
How is she?

662
00:57:23,641 --> 00:57:24,775
Well, the queen...

663
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:25,743
The horse.

664
00:57:25,810 --> 00:57:27,912
Oh, she's doing fine, sire.

665
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,949
Where did you get that?

666
00:57:32,016 --> 00:57:34,151
Please, sir.
I did nothing wrong.

667
00:57:34,218 --> 00:57:35,219
It was given to me.

668
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,220
Who gave it to you?

669
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,221
My father gave it to me.

670
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,288
How did he get it?

671
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:39,557
He got it from a girl.

672
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:41,425
My father
was the queen's huntsman.

673
00:57:41,492 --> 00:57:43,027
She hired him
to kill a girl.

674
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:44,294
So he killed her?

675
00:57:44,361 --> 00:57:46,831
No. He planned to,
but he did not.

676
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:51,669
Then she's still alive.

677
00:57:52,436 --> 00:57:53,938
Sire?

678
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,342
We are expected
for dinner.

679
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,577
Where
are you going?

680
00:57:59,644 --> 00:58:02,847
And what shall
I tell her?

681
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:23,500
Foolishness.

682
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:25,502
[Torch fire
crackling]

683
00:58:43,153 --> 00:58:44,555
Where is she?

684
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:48,492
Where is she?
Where is snow white?

685
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:49,493
You are not welcome.

686
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:50,661
I know she did not die.

687
00:58:50,728 --> 00:58:51,962
Where is she?

688
00:59:22,526 --> 00:59:25,763
Ah, I'm too late.

689
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:30,100
I'm truly sorry, my lord.

690
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:34,739
I'm so sorry.

691
01:00:08,706 --> 01:00:10,307
Her hand.

692
01:00:10,374 --> 01:00:11,842
It moved in mine.

693
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,105
Poison.

694
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:45,876
This was
the queen's doing.

695
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:47,511
And she has the runt.
We need to stop her.

696
01:00:47,577 --> 01:00:48,846
We must attack her now

697
01:00:48,913 --> 01:00:50,347
While she still believes
I'll marry her.

698
01:00:50,414 --> 01:00:52,182
How many elves can you
muster for a fight?

699
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:54,618
Not many. There are not
many free elves left.

700
01:00:54,685 --> 01:00:56,854
I know, but the queen
has many enemies

701
01:00:56,921 --> 01:00:58,488
Across four kingdoms.

702
01:00:58,555 --> 01:01:00,524
With their support, we
shall have a fearsome army.

703
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:01,759
Good.

704
01:01:01,826 --> 01:01:03,593
Don't get too close
to the queen.

705
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,729
She has ways
of enchanting men

706
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:05,863
Into doing what she wants.

707
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:07,597
As she did
with my father.

708
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:09,599
Her spells
will not work on me.

709
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,002
I only have eyes
for one.

710
01:01:13,337 --> 01:01:15,740
I shall return tomorrow
at daybreak.

711
01:01:17,574 --> 01:01:19,176
Then we strike.

712
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:26,851
She tried
to take you from me,

713
01:01:26,917 --> 01:01:30,120
But I swear she will
never harm you again,

714
01:01:30,187 --> 01:01:33,357
If you will consent
to be my queen.

715
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:40,664
Snow... I love you
with all my heart,

716
01:01:40,731 --> 01:01:43,467
And I shall
love you forever.

717
01:01:45,235 --> 01:01:46,871
Will you marry me?

718
01:01:48,672 --> 01:01:50,274
I will.

719
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,222
I must go.

720
01:02:08,358 --> 01:02:09,960
I shall return for you.

721
01:02:46,663 --> 01:02:48,532
Mara:
I sense your worry.

722
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,873
If we are victorious,
you become queen.

723
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:58,943
If my father
had intended me to rule,

724
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:01,846
He would have made
arrangements.

725
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:05,715
War, usurping the throne...

726
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,985
It does not feel correct.

727
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:14,324
Your father
was a good man,

728
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:17,794
But he was blinded
by the queen's charms.

729
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:20,931
What of your mother,
princess?

730
01:03:20,998 --> 01:03:24,068
What did she
intend for you?

731
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:26,971
I wish I could ask her.

732
01:03:28,772 --> 01:03:30,274
She has already told you

733
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,277
Everything
you need to know.

734
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,647
The story?

735
01:03:37,714 --> 01:03:41,218
Of the fallen star
and the luminary?

736
01:03:41,285 --> 01:03:43,387
It is for you
to find that answer

737
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:45,856
Within yourself.

738
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:55,565
A fresh horse for me.

739
01:03:55,632 --> 01:03:56,934
Ready my men.
Prince!

740
01:03:57,001 --> 01:03:59,469
I'm amassing an army
to destroy the queen.

741
01:03:59,536 --> 01:04:00,770
Destroy the queen?

742
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,672
You are to marry her
in one day's time.

743
01:04:02,739 --> 01:04:05,976
No, Hugh.
I shall marry snow white.

744
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:09,079
Really?

745
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:12,549
What wonderful news.

746
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:17,521
But still the queen
awaits you for dinner,

747
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:20,690
So she will not take
kindly being rejected.

748
01:04:20,757 --> 01:04:22,059
What shall we do?

749
01:04:22,126 --> 01:04:23,693
Yes, the queen
will likely grow suspicious

750
01:04:23,760 --> 01:04:25,429
If I do not appear.

751
01:04:25,495 --> 01:04:28,032
Perhaps you go on
and dine with the queen,

752
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,234
And I shall go
from kingdom to kingdom

753
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:31,801
To commit the army
to our cause.

754
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,237
Good. It's a fine idea.

755
01:04:33,303 --> 01:04:35,805
You must make sure
they agree.

756
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,075
Our victory depends on it.

757
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:53,323
His royal highness,
prince Alexander of northfalia.

758
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,527
My queen.

759
01:04:59,063 --> 01:05:00,597
Please forgive
my tardiness.

760
01:05:00,664 --> 01:05:01,865
Of course, dear prince.

761
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:04,134
It is so good
to see you again.

762
01:05:04,201 --> 01:05:06,103
When Hugh told me
of your delay,

763
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:09,606
I thought perhaps something
more important had come up.

764
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,641
No, of course not.

765
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,147
To us.

766
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:27,391
What could possibly be more
important than all of this?

767
01:05:27,457 --> 01:05:29,493
I do not know.

768
01:05:29,559 --> 01:05:31,895
Perhaps going
from town to town

769
01:05:31,962 --> 01:05:34,598
Trying to amass
an army against me?

770
01:05:45,842 --> 01:05:47,644
I'm sorry, my lord,

771
01:05:47,711 --> 01:05:50,080
But it is necessary.

772
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,782
This is treason!

773
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:54,951
You've done well.

774
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,354
Take him to the dungeon.

775
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:00,824
Get some beauty sleep,
dear prince.

776
01:06:00,890 --> 01:06:02,726
Tomorrow's
our wedding day.

777
01:06:04,728 --> 01:06:07,097
[Grunting with effort]

778
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:09,699
It's useless. Trust me.

779
01:06:09,766 --> 01:06:13,003
I am still hoping somebody
might come for me, but...

780
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,339
You're the runt?
Yes.

781
01:06:15,405 --> 01:06:18,575
Yeah. Well, technically
I'm your rescue party.

782
01:06:28,252 --> 01:06:30,587
Daybreak is near.

783
01:06:30,654 --> 01:06:34,391
Let us hope the prince
brings a formidable army.

784
01:06:40,064 --> 01:06:42,266
Queen: Alert me as soon
as the priest arrives.

785
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,071
Unfortunately, I must keep you
alive until after the wedding,

786
01:06:47,137 --> 01:06:49,539
At which point,
my possession of your lands

787
01:06:49,606 --> 01:06:52,576
Becomes completely legal
and legitimate.

788
01:06:52,642 --> 01:06:54,411
I will never
marry you.

789
01:06:54,478 --> 01:06:57,414
Oh, you will.

790
01:06:57,481 --> 01:07:00,517
Don't look into her eyes.

791
01:07:05,922 --> 01:07:08,192
It's a pity, though.

792
01:07:08,258 --> 01:07:10,494
You're a handsome man.

793
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,497
Are you sure
you won't be mine

794
01:07:13,563 --> 01:07:16,166
And rule
side by side forever?

795
01:07:16,233 --> 01:07:18,135
Yes. Yes.

796
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:21,105
Together. Forever.

797
01:07:21,171 --> 01:07:24,841
That's right.

798
01:07:24,908 --> 01:07:26,943
You are the most
beautiful thing

799
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:30,214
I've ever laid
my eyes upon.

800
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:40,657
I have been blind,
my queen.

801
01:07:40,724 --> 01:07:42,726
Please forgive me.

802
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:52,669
Madam?

803
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,071
Madam?

804
01:07:55,139 --> 01:07:57,941
What?!
Has the priest arrived?

805
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:01,578
No, madam, but your army
awaits you in the Western yard.

806
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:07,417
All right.
This may have to wait.

807
01:08:34,178 --> 01:08:36,246
He will come.

808
01:08:49,493 --> 01:08:52,429
The troops are ready to march
on northfalia, madam.

809
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:07,277
If it's a war they want,
a war we shall give them.

810
01:09:07,344 --> 01:09:10,447
Leave no man nor elf alive.

811
01:09:17,354 --> 01:09:19,423
Female elf:
Who is that?

812
01:09:22,025 --> 01:09:23,627
Isabella!

813
01:09:25,195 --> 01:09:28,298
You have no business
here, traitor.

814
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:31,034
I will live in fear
of the queen no longer.

815
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,237
The queen's army
is on the march.

816
01:09:33,303 --> 01:09:36,206
You must all flee.
Please!

817
01:09:36,273 --> 01:09:38,174
What of prince Alexander?
Have you seen him?

818
01:09:38,242 --> 01:09:39,576
I'm sorry, my lady,

819
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:41,911
But he's fallen under
the queen's spell.

820
01:09:41,978 --> 01:09:44,348
He cannot help you now.

821
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:53,557
I do hear them,
the queen's army.

822
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:54,691
We must run.

823
01:09:54,758 --> 01:09:57,261
We do not have enough
elves to fight.

824
01:09:57,327 --> 01:10:00,230
I will not flee,

825
01:10:00,297 --> 01:10:04,100
Not before the evil
that faces us now.

826
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:07,036
We have no choice
but to fight

827
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:10,607
For our land, for our kind,

828
01:10:10,674 --> 01:10:12,809
For all
that have come before.

829
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:15,845
We must fight.

830
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:20,717
If we are to die in battle,
we die with honor.

831
01:10:45,141 --> 01:10:47,010
Are you all right,
princess?

832
01:10:49,679 --> 01:10:52,616
The time for war is upon us.

833
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:08,465
That was a perfect kiss.

834
01:11:08,532 --> 01:11:11,100
It's almost as if
she had the key

835
01:11:11,167 --> 01:11:13,036
To unlock my heart.

836
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,752
This way.

837
01:11:28,818 --> 01:11:30,320
No, no, no, wait.

838
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,524
Unchain them.

839
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:38,261
Who here seeks
to overthrow the queen?

840
01:11:38,328 --> 01:11:41,431
I am weak,
but I will fight.

841
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,668
I will do whatever you ask.

842
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:46,035
As would I.

843
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:50,073
I cannot promise
we will win,

844
01:11:50,139 --> 01:11:53,810
But we shall certainly
give her one mighty battle.

845
01:12:29,112 --> 01:12:31,581
Have the guards been dispatched
to the north hill?

846
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:34,451
Yes, madam. They will
acquire the flame.

847
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,642
Pitiful.

848
01:13:03,346 --> 01:13:05,615
Unleash the dogs.

849
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:13,890
Ready your weapons.

850
01:13:24,701 --> 01:13:25,869
Fire!

851
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:09,946
[Rumbling]

852
01:14:20,089 --> 01:14:21,758
[Yelping, whimpering]

853
01:14:29,365 --> 01:14:30,667
Decimate them all.

854
01:14:30,734 --> 01:14:33,136
All but snow white.

855
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:34,871
Leave her to me.

856
01:14:35,839 --> 01:14:37,073
Aah!

857
01:15:24,788 --> 01:15:26,823
Guard: There they are!
After them!

858
01:15:28,291 --> 01:15:29,959
Aah!

859
01:15:45,975 --> 01:15:47,744
Not long now.

860
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,152
They have come.

861
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,054
The dark elves!

862
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:55,378
Summon the priest.

863
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:58,742
[War cries]

864
01:18:08,852 --> 01:18:10,854
[Swords clanging]

865
01:18:33,142 --> 01:18:37,981
[Battle sounds
fade to silence]

866
01:18:41,450 --> 01:18:43,119
Aah!

867
01:18:45,321 --> 01:18:47,323
[Silence]

868
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,393
[Groans]

869
01:20:01,064 --> 01:20:04,333
You chose wrong again,
dear fiance.

870
01:20:11,340 --> 01:20:12,909
Weapons down.

871
01:20:22,451 --> 01:20:23,452
Now!

872
01:20:35,899 --> 01:20:37,901
Good.

873
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:42,405
Now, thank you all
for coming to my wedding.

874
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:45,208
Especially you,
my guest of honor.

875
01:20:46,876 --> 01:20:48,912
Summon the priest.

876
01:21:11,334 --> 01:21:13,436
Begin.

877
01:21:14,971 --> 01:21:17,640
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered all together

878
01:21:17,706 --> 01:21:22,578
To join together this man
and woman in holy matrimony.

879
01:21:32,956 --> 01:21:35,724
Prince Alexander,
do you take queen...

880
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:37,126
He does.

881
01:21:39,828 --> 01:21:41,330
Do you, queen Gwendolyn,

882
01:21:41,397 --> 01:21:43,699
Take prince Alexander
to be your husband,

883
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:46,102
To love him, comfort him,

884
01:21:46,169 --> 01:21:48,871
And keep him
in sickness and in health

885
01:21:48,938 --> 01:21:52,575
Until death do you part?

886
01:21:52,641 --> 01:21:54,110
I do.

887
01:22:04,387 --> 01:22:06,089
I require
and charge you both

888
01:22:06,155 --> 01:22:07,656
That if either of you know
any impediment

889
01:22:07,723 --> 01:22:11,027
Why ye may not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony

890
01:22:11,094 --> 01:22:12,761
That ye confess it.

891
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:16,065
Bless these two that they may be
ever faithful to one another

892
01:22:16,132 --> 01:22:17,833
And live
and grow old together

893
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:20,136
And see their children's
children.

894
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:22,338
As those
that have come before,

895
01:22:22,405 --> 01:22:24,240
So these persons
may surely perform

896
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:27,076
And keep the vow and covenant
betwixt them made

897
01:22:27,143 --> 01:22:29,045
And may ever
hereafter remain

898
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:31,280
In perfect love
and peace together.

899
01:22:31,347 --> 01:22:32,848
As you have bravely
and solemnly

900
01:22:32,915 --> 01:22:34,483
Come here
to this place today,

901
01:22:34,550 --> 01:22:36,119
Know that
by all here present

902
01:22:36,185 --> 01:22:38,121
And by your own actions

903
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:39,955
You have signified
unto our community

904
01:22:40,023 --> 01:22:41,524
That you are worthy
and ready

905
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,526
To care for the person
of your choosing

906
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:44,960
From this day forward,

907
01:22:45,028 --> 01:22:46,962
To take thy partner's hand

908
01:22:47,030 --> 01:22:49,098
In all things true
and active life

909
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:53,436
Surpassed only by
a subsequent calling to arms.

910
01:22:53,502 --> 01:22:54,837
