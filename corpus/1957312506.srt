1
00:00:00,583 --> 00:00:02,836
(light chiming)

2
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,691
(birds chirping)

3
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,252
(gentle music)

4
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:11,381
- [Narrator] Once upon
a long, long time ago

5
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:15,135
in a country by the sea,
far, far away from here.

6
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,138
In a country where
our summer is winter

7
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,472
and our winter is summer.

8
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,058
In a country where
the water swirls

9
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,560
in the opposite direction,

10
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,062
and where trees grow that
nobody has ever seen before.

11
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,023
And where sometimes you
wonder if the sun sets

12
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:30,733
in the east or in the west.

13
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,902
And where everything
is different.

14
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:35,530
And where you have
to stand on your head

15
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,739
to see the man in the moon,

16
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:38,908
for even the man in
the moon is different.

17
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,827
'Cause the moon
itself is upside down.

18
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,582
Now, in this country
which is near the sea

19
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:47,709
and where the sun
regulates the ocean tides

20
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:50,420
instead of the moon like
it is everywhere else,

21
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,922
in this country
there lived a man.

22
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,425
The man was not
rich, he was poor.

23
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,636
Not really very poor, just poor.

24
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,431
You see, when you're
very poor it means

25
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:02,932
that you don't
have enough to eat.

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,269
But when you are
poor and just poor,

27
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,979
it means that you
have enough to eat,

28
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,564
but you eat cheaply.

29
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,233
When you are poor and just poor,

30
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,402
it means you have to work hard.

31
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,946
And when you work hard,
you get very hungry.

32
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,281
And when you are really hungry,

33
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:21,034
even the simplest food
will taste very good.

34
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,620
And you will eat very well
because you need the food

35
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,206
to give you the strength
to work again the next day.

36
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:28,333
But all of that,
you will understand

37
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,460
when you grow up a bit more.

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,087
(gentle music)

39
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,185
Let's go back to
the country where

40
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,354
the man in the moon
is upside down.

41
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,315
In this country by the sea
there was a big mountain

42
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:53,983
and the mountain was
not too far from where

43
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,611
the poor man lived
with his family.

44
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,988
And the mountain was very
big and made of stone.

45
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,824
There were soft
stone and hard stone,

46
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,535
and lots of stones
that was even harder.

47
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,996
The stones were many colors,

48
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,874
and some blue like the
ocean, some were green,

49
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:12,126
dark green, and light,
and there was red also,

50
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,504
and some were very dark blue.

51
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:17,340
Some of the stones, the ones
that were very, very hard,

52
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,387
looked like they had
fire burning inside them.

53
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:24,806
The really hard stones, of
course, were the diamonds,

54
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:26,099
but they were very small.

55
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:28,559
The red ones were called rubies.

56
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,144
The blue were turquoises.

57
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:32,480
There are amethysts and
garnets and there were stones

58
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,023
of many, many different colors.

59
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,985
And there was one stone
that looked like a teardrop

60
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:39,070
or a piece of melted ice.

61
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,613
But it had a difficult name,

62
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,324
and the poor man could never
remember the difficult name.

63
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,202
There were many others,

64
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,538
but there was a lot of
ordinary stone also.

65
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:50,039
And the man who
ate rather cheaply,

66
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,917
went to the mountain every
day of the week, but Sunday.

67
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:54,460
(bells ringing)
Because on Sunday,

68
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,964
he went to church with
this little family.

69
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:05,388
(singing in foreign language)

70
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,699
(light music)

71
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,453
And he cut through lots
and lots of ordinary stone

72
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,164
to get to the beautiful
hard, colored stones.

73
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,291
And that was a lot of hard work,

74
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,752
but the beautiful colors
of the stones made it all

75
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,713
worthwhile because that was
the way the man who was poor,

76
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:24,300
but not very poor, earned
money to buy the food,

77
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,762
so that he and his family
could eat well and cheaply.

78
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,390
And at night, when the
cool night wind blew

79
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,641
from the top of the mountain,

80
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,476
all the way down to
the little thatched hut

81
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,770
of the stonecutter
and his family,

82
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:40,316
they slept well and warm, and
they all loved each other.

83
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,610
And that is the way it was.

84
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,165
(ethereal music)

85
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:58,876
The next day, the stonecutter
did not find many stones.

86
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:02,255
The work was hard
and the sun was hot,

87
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,508
and now it was getting
to the middle of the day

88
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,218
and he had only
found four garnets.

89
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,555
The garnets were light red.

90
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:12,807
He liked rubies better.

91
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,018
It was always a good day
when he found rubies.

92
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,940
Rubies were deep, dark
red and full of mystery.

93
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,025
And he could also sell
them for much more,

94
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:27,572
but they were much
more difficult to find,

95
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,199
and he did not find them often.

96
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,087
He was hot and tired from
working the mountain,

97
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,257
so he went to the
nearby waterfall

98
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,302
to wash the dust
off his shoulders.

99
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,933
He liked to sound with the
clear cascading waters.

100
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,145
The falling waters brushed
the dust off his back

101
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,897
and he felt nice and clean.

102
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,192
The waters of the fall
cooled him off also,

103
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,861
and he felt a lot less tired.

104
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,488
It was good to
have the waterfall

105
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:11,240
so close to his work
on the mountain,

106
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,743
because sometimes when he
wanted to work on some stones,

107
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,870
he would carry the stones
to the mountain pool

108
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,664
and do his work in the
shade near to fall,

109
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:21,334
because then he could
listen to the birds also.

110
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,046
The birds were always there,
(birds chirping)

111
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,757
from early in the morning
and all throughout the day.

112
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,052
And the birds drank from
the pool near the fall,

113
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:33,930
and the falling water
sang with the birds,

114
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,766
and the birds sang
with the falling water.

115
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,602
And all of it, the
falling of the cool water

116
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:43,231
and the singing of the birds
in the trees near the pool,

117
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:45,733
made it a good place to
come and rest for a while.

118
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,529
At times, he wondered if
at night the bird slept

119
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,072
in the trees near the waterfall

120
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,866
or into trees lower
down the mountain

121
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:57,036
where they could not hear
the singing of the water.

122
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:01,123
Or perhaps the water sang
very, very softly at night,

123
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,001
so it would not disturb the
birds sleeping in the trees.

124
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,798
After a while, he
climbed a big rock.

125
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,385
Close to where he had done
the work for the morning.

126
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,804
There was a soft
wind blowing now.

127
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:19,016
So he spread out his arms
and let the sun and the wind

128
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:21,102
then dry him off.

129
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,312
It felt good to stand
there on the big rock,

130
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,692
high above the village and
the valley and the sea.

131
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,735
The sun had dried him off now,

132
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,029
so he said down to eat his food.

133
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:34,657
(gentle music)

134
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,003
And then, he thought
about going fishing

135
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:50,339
with old Thomas near
the pass of the reef.

136
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,633
In hearing the sound of
the waves on the reef

137
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,177
in the seascape of his mind,

138
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:57,013
made him close his
eyes for a moment.

139
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:02,018
And as he did so, he
entered the world of dreams.

140
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,187
(light playful music)

141
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:24,457
And he flew with the birds over
the waves of the big ocean,

142
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,460
and flying with the
birds he saw dolphins,

143
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,588
playfully jumping near
the path for the lagoon

144
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,923
in the seascape of his mind.

145
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,509
(gentle music)

146
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,997
And he reminded
himself in his dream

147
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,459
to tell old Thomas about
flying with the birds.

148
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,920
It could be a sign perhaps.

149
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,713
And surely, old
Thomas would know.

150
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,633
Because he had been
living on the beach

151
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,677
as long as anyone
could remember.

152
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:21,013
And old Thomas knew all about
the winds and the tides.

153
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,849
The stonecutter knew
all about the stones

154
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,227
in the mountain and
where to find them.

155
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,437
But old Thomas new
everything about the sea.

156
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:31,107
(conc shell whistling)

157
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:33,609
The sound of the conc
shell woke him up.

158
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,903
The sun was a little higher
in the sky now and he had

159
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,322
remembered that he had
promised his wife and children

160
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:41,867
that he would meet them in the
village to watch the dancers.

161
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,537
So, he started walking down
the mountain and he heard

162
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,873
the singing of the dancers
from down below in the village.

163
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,627
And all of a sudden, he did
not feel tired at all anymore.

164
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,672
(singing in foreign language)

165
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,674
He thought it would be
nice to buy some flowers

166
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:58,384
for his wife at
Ella's fruit stand.

167
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,979
And he bought the flowers
from her granddaughter.

168
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,940
And he paid for the flowers
with one of the garnets.

169
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:16,777
(singing in foreign language)

170
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,783
And now, he had only three left,

171
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,368
but that was all
right because he knew

172
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,662
that his wife would be
happy with the flowers.

173
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,959
And he walked a little faster.

174
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:35,296
He did not look back to wave
at Ella and her granddaughter,

175
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,089
so he never saw
the beautiful child

176
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:39,675
with the white dress
in the distance.

177
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,511
She was wearing a
crown of flowers,

178
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,306
and she was lovely to look at.

179
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,683
She did not wear any shoes.

180
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,687
And her eyes were
very, very beautiful.

181
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:55,149
If the stonecutter
would have seen her,

182
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,318
he would have noticed her eyes;

183
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:01,363
lovingly, dreamily beautiful
like a secret found

184
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:04,700
in a garden of a dream
in the early summer.

185
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,870
But the stonecutter did
not see any of that.

186
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,664
After he had taken
his flowers home,

187
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,000
he arrived in the village.

188
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,585
The dancers had already started.

189
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,962
His wife and children were there

190
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:19,507
and so was Ella and
her granddaughter.

191
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:24,512
(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)

192
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,977
(gentle music)

193
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:07,276
The smell of roasting coffee
woke him up the next morning.

194
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:22,374
Old Thomas had given him
some fish the night before,

195
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,709
so he walked out onto the beach

196
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,961
and started feeding the birds.

197
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,381
(gentle music continues)

198
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,392
Thomas had told him that
the sign of flying with

199
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:44,980
the birds in his dream on
the mountain was a good sign.

200
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,817
The stonecutter
walked along the cool,

201
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,319
shady road in the forest.

202
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,947
He had passed Hiro's
house and he had asked him

203
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:55,783
if he could make a
tattoo on his arm.

204
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,576
And Hiro had told him
that he would come

205
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,079
to the stonecutter's house
a bit later in the day.

206
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,292
The stonecutter gathered greens
for the rabbits of his son.

207
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,685
And now, he sat
near the stone slab

208
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,355
in the quietness of the glade.

209
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:30,359
And from far away, he heard
the singing of children.

210
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:33,612
And he thought how
early they had started.

211
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,240
With the smell of
the roasting coffee

212
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,284
and the birds and
the sun also rising.

213
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,287
And he knew that his day on the
mountain would be good also.

214
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,833
The day had started well with
the feeding of the birds,

215
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,544
and the waves rolling
in gently over the reef.

216
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:50,963
And when a day starts well,

217
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,881
he knew that it would
keep on going well.

218
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,550
One good thing after another.

219
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:59,555
But it also would be nice
if there could be a sign.

220
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,390
Like flying with the
birds in his dream

221
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,851
on the mountain the day before.

222
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,644
And from away in the distance
(school bell chiming)

223
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:08,689
he heard the school bell chime.

224
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,816
But he did not know
if that was his sign.

225
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,736
And he hit the stone
slab with his chisel.

226
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,613
(chisel clinking)

227
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,990
And the school
bell chimed again.

228
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:21,160
(school bell chiming)

229
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,955
And as he hit the
stone slab again,

230
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,333
the school bell chimed
in perfect harmony

231
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,793
with the sounds of the stone.

232
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,797
And he knew that was his sign.

233
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,926
And he also knew
that all was well.

234
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,768
(soft relaxing music)

235
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,691
When the stonecutter came
home later that afternoon,

236
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,445
the children were weaving
baskets and hats with Ella.

237
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:59,781
And his wife had been roasting
breadfruit on an open fire.

238
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,591
But his day on the mountain
had been very good.

239
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,092
Better than usual.

240
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,137
And all in all, with the
birds early in the morning

241
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:25,349
and the gentle waves and
the sound in the stone,

242
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:29,144
it had been a very good
day on the mountain.

243
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,522
He was sitting at a
table when Hiro arrived.

244
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:35,692
(soft relaxing music)

245
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,991
The stonecutter wanted
a round tattoo and Hiro

246
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,451
told him that when completed,

247
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,912
the tattoo would illustrate
the path of his life.

248
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,456
No matter where you started,

249
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,833
it would always be
at the beginning.

250
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,587
Then he would move on,
the beginning would become

251
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,465
the end of the beginning.

252
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:01,301
And also, the
beginning of the end.

253
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,971
Once you begin your
journey somewhere,

254
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,973
you will in the course
of your progress,

255
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,349
forget where you began.

256
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:10,644
And if you did that,
you would not know where

257
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,230
the circle of your
life would end.

258
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,607
And he thought about all of that

259
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,402
as his wife massaged his back.

260
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,113
And at times, he would
look out into the faraway

261
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,532
distance where the sun
painted brilliant colors

262
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,242
on the waters of the lagoon.

263
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,998
And one night, he stood
on the beach and looked

264
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,541
at the three quarter full moon,

265
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,086
and the silver reflections
on the calm lagoon.

266
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,215
(soft relaxing music)

267
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,142
And standing on the beach,
thinking about the fish,

268
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:53,020
and thinking about his family
asleep in his little house,

269
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,690
all this made him wonder
about the purpose of his life.

270
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,485
And he looked up at the
moon hanging in the dark sky

271
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,697
of the night, and he wondered
what it would be like

272
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,783
to fly beyond the moon
and out to the stars.

273
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,286
And time started to slow down.

274
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,715
(gentle music)

275
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:36,438
The winds had been blowing
steadily from the northeast for

276
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:40,525
the last four days now, and
the lagoon was nice and calm.

277
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,111
(gentle music)

278
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,293
Every morning, he
had walked over

279
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:00,087
to ask old Thomas
about the fishing.

280
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,465
And every morning, the
reply had been the same.

281
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:07,094
"Not today, perhaps tomorrow."

282
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,649
For three days, the stonecutter
had watched the waves on

283
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,652
the reef while feeding his
manta rays in the early morning.

284
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:26,154
And for three days, there
hardly had been any clouds

285
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,656
in the sky at all.

286
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:42,504
Finally, the day arrived.

287
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,174
The stonecutter had not
been flying with birds

288
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,426
in any of his dreams,

289
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,970
but if old Thomas said
that today was the day,

290
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:53,515
then that was all right
because he had been fishing

291
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,309
the lagoon for longer than
anyone could remember.

292
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,693
Thomas and the stonecutter
prepared their fishing lines.

293
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,783
They took a small board
for cutting the bait

294
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,244
that the old man had
caught the night before.

295
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,879
And the children took the palm
leaf covers off the canoe.

296
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,885
And they rowed the canoe
with slow, steady strokes

297
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:32,220
to where they would do their
fishing for the afternoon

298
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,597
and part of the night.

299
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,224
(gentle music)

300
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:04,294
The steady rolling of the
waves on the coral reef

301
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,504
was good to listen to.

302
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,424
And they saw a solitary
white bird flying home

303
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,761
to the dark green hills
in the faraway distance.

304
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:24,189
There was always solitude
that went with the fishing.

305
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,149
And sometimes the stonecutter
thought that he liked

306
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,944
the solitude of fishing better
than the fishing itself.

307
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:32,614
There was solitude in the
mountain too, of course,

308
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,575
but he never did have to do
any waiting on the mountain.

309
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,244
There was always
something to do.

310
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:41,289
(gentle music)

311
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:23,248
There was more time for
thinking when fishing.

312
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,625
Most of the things you thought
about would not make much

313
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,794
sense anymore in the early
morning when the smell of

314
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,839
roasting coffee would start
to drift out over the lagoon,

315
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,049
because then we'd only
think about coming home

316
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,384
to your wife and children.

317
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,598
Letting your thoughts
drift along slowly

318
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,142
was all part of fishing,
like the waves on the reef

319
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,978
and the solitary
bird flying away,

320
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,105
and the gold around the
white clouds when the sun

321
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,608
would get lower and lower
in the sky of the west.

322
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,363
They never talked much, old
Thomas and the stonecutter.

323
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,616
And when they did talk,
it was about fishing.

324
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,202
Sometimes he wondered if
old Thomas would think about

325
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,539
different things than
fishing, but he never asked.

326
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,542
The old man did not ask either.

327
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,004
So there was the waiting.

328
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:14,382
Waiting for the fish and the
first little tugs on the line,

329
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,385
and then the fish taking
the bait, pulling strongly.

330
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,888
And then the fish trying
to get off the hook,

331
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,723
and swimming and
darting any which way

332
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:23,725
to try and shake off the hook.

333
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:26,561
And then everything
would start to speed up,

334
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:28,730
and time would go very
fast until the fish

335
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,732
was safely in the canoe.

336
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:33,902
And then you could let
time slow down again.

337
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,446
(gentle music)

338
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,600
And with the slowing
down of time,

339
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,686
the waiting would start again.

340
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:12,315
And with the waiting, the
thinking would start again also;

341
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,693
thinking about having
breakfast in the early morning

342
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,487
of the next day made him
smile ever so softly.

343
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:19,781
And he looked at
the old man to see

344
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,282
if he had noticed him smiling.

345
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:24,452
But old Thomas was
fishing and seemed

346
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:27,622
to be thinking
thoughts of his own.

347
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,877
There were no more
birds at sea now,

348
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,879
and the lagoon kept
changing colors

349
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,673
with the reflections of the sun.

350
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:41,261
And they knew that the fishing
would be good at night also.

351
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,894
(light calming music)

352
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,293
One early morning when he
went to work on the mountain,

353
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,169
he saw a child.

354
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,296
And she was all dressed in white

355
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:18,840
with a crown of
flowers on her head.

356
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,593
She was very beautiful
and she had long hair,

357
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,510
and she did not wear any shoes.

358
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:26,389
He waved at the child and
she waved back at him,

359
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,850
and that made him
feel very good.

360
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:30,685
During the day as
he did his work,

361
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,187
he often thought of the child.

362
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,648
When the sun rose high in
the sky and became too hot

363
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:39,694
on his back, he sat down
under a tree to eat the food

364
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,614
that his wife had
prepared for him.

365
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,545
And he thought of
the child again.

366
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,964
He thought that it would be
nice if he would see her again

367
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,007
on the way back home.

368
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:04,886
Perhaps she would wave at
him again from a distance.

369
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,223
At the end of the day when
the sun went down in the sky,

370
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,099
he finished his work
and he was tired.

371
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,894
He walked down the
mountain road back

372
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,479
to his house in the woods.

373
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:17,774
But he did not see the child.

374
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,994
He did not tell his wife
or his children about

375
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,789
the child with the white dress
and no shoes on her feet.

376
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:35,708
And that night they all
slept well and warm,

377
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,377
and they were happy
and contented.

378
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,756
The child was not there
the next morning either,

379
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,341
nor the next.

380
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,426
And the sun was hot
and the work was hard,

381
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,387
and at the end of
the day he was tired,

382
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,098
but the stonecutter did
not mind because his wife

383
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,267
had told him that there
would soon be another

384
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:53,768
little baby in the family.

385
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,770
And that made the
stonecutter very happy,

386
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,439
even though he would have to
work harder to earn more money

387
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,441
to buy the food for
the new baby child.

388
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:14,122
And then, when he had almost
forgotten about the child

389
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,124
in the white dress with
the flowers on her head

390
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,334
and no shoes on her feet,

391
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,086
he saw her again
early one morning.

392
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,464
And she waved at him as
if she recognized him,

393
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:26,259
and he waved back at her and
he felt happy all day long.

394
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,096
Perhaps because of the
child with no shoes

395
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:33,182
or perhaps because of the new
baby that was going to come

396
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:35,476
or perhaps because of both.

397
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,312
He was not quite sure.

398
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,109
He did not really expect to
see her after he had stopped

399
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:45,612
work the next day when
the sun was down low

400
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,573
in the sky again, but she was
there on the side of the road,

401
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,492
a little closer this time.

402
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:54,162
The last rays of the
sun lit up her dress

403
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,371
with soft yellow gold.

404
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:58,666
And she was very beautiful.

405
00:31:58,666 --> 00:31:59,626
And she waved again.

406
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,629
She was close enough so
that the poor stonecutter

407
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:04,464
could see that
she smiled at him.

408
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:05,798
And he waved to
her and walked back

409
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:08,051
to his little thatched
house under the trees.

410
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:13,139
And that night, he did
not feel tired at all.

411
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:13,973
Not even one little bit.

412
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,353
(soft calming music)

413
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,696
His encounters with the child
became closer and closer,

414
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:32,033
and she was there again the
next morning, and the next.

415
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,119
And her flowers never faded
and she waved and she smiled

416
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,414
as before, and it all made the
stonecutter feel very good.

417
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,375
And each time, she
got a little closer.

418
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:42,961
And each time, she smiled.

419
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,631
And then, one afternoon just
as the sun poured bright

420
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,426
yellow gold all over her
dress again, she spoke to him.

421
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,053
And the stonecutter
noticed her eyes,

422
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:54,555
and her eyes were light green.

423
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,183
Light gray green like
the waters of the lagoon

424
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:00,186
just before you get
to the coral reef.

425
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,522
Light green like the
lightest of the green stones

426
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,856
in the mountain.

427
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,611
And the light green windows
of her soul smiled at him.

428
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,581
(birds chirping)

429
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,709
She told the stonecutter that
she would give him something

430
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,586
to make him feel good and to
make his work a lot easier,

431
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,922
and she smiled as
she spoke to him.

432
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:31,009
And she gave him seven
beautiful music sounds.

433
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,761
(gentle humming)

434
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:54,240
She told him that if he would
whistle them or sing them

435
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,618
or even hum them, then the
sun would not be so hot

436
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,953
and he would be less tired

437
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,830
and he would feel
good all day long.

438
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,167
And then, she disappeared
all of a sudden.

439
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,087
But the perfume of her
flower crown lingered on.

440
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,848
The stonecutter tried the
sounds and the sounds went from

441
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,101
low to high like climbing
up the steps of a ladder.

442
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:25,563
He whistled them
also and sometimes he
sort of hummed them.

443
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,066
But he liked singing
or whistling the best.

444
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,069
While climbing up the
mountain to get stone,

445
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,363
he would start a game with
the sounds on the mountain.

446
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,990
He would wait until
he was halfway up,

447
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,825
and then he would tell himself,

448
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,994
"Now I will start
the music sounds.

449
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:42,580
And when I will have
whistled all seven of them,

450
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,041
I will stop at the last sound."

451
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,584
And it worked.

452
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,336
He always found more
beautiful stones

453
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:51,172
at the place where
the last sound ended.

454
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:54,133
More than he had ever found
in any place on the mountain.

455
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,721
The music sounds are the
special magic all of their own.

456
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,600
(gentle humming)

457
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:27,208
Then, one day, he lost
one of the sounds.

458
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,877
(eerie chiming)

459
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,675
It just disappeared and no
matter how hard he tried

460
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,678
to remember it, it did not
come back into his head.

461
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:43,558
He tried everything;
humming, whistling, singing.

462
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:48,938
And every time he counted
them, but he had only six left.

463
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:50,898
He had lost it and
he was a little sad.

464
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,153
(light music)

465
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,488
And he wished that the
child with the white dress

466
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,657
would be on the side
of the road again.

467
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:03,119
And perhaps she would help
him find the missing sound,

468
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,621
but the child was not
there that afternoon.

469
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:07,832
And he never did find
the missing sound.

470
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,130
Now he had only six
music sounds left

471
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,757
and it bothered him not
to have all seven anymore.

472
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:20,761
And he cut stone as before,
and the work was hard,

473
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:25,099
and he was disappointed
about the sound he had lost.

474
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:35,026
And then, he lost another
one of the magic sounds.

475
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,945
He tried to remember what
it sounded like so that

476
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,364
he could bring it back into
his head, but it had gone,

477
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,950
disappeared just
like the first one.

478
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,871
And he thought, pretty
soon I will lose them all,

479
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:49,790
and then I won't have
any music sounds left.

480
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,210
And the more he thought about
it, the more he worried.

481
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,628
And the more worried, the
more frightened he became.

482
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,424
Afraid that he would lose
the next magic sound.

483
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,468
And because he worried
about losing the next sound,

484
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,595
he counted how many he had left,

485
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,430
just in case he might
have lost another one

486
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,140
of his magic sounds.

487
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,643
(light music)

488
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,080
And then, he lost it.

489
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,167
(eerie chiming)

490
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,336
Early in the morning on the
way to the big mountain,

491
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:37,505
it disappeared and
he knew it was gone.

492
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,800
And he knew it
would not come back.

493
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:44,512
And when he climbed up the
mountain, he worried a lot.

494
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,348
And he did not use his remaining
sounds at all that day.

495
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,559
And when his work was finished,
he walked down the mountain,

496
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:53,980
and he did not even notice
the beautiful sunset,

497
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,773
and the child with
the flower crown

498
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,817
and the white dress
was not there either.

499
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,154
He looks in the grass to
see if she had been there,

500
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,949
but no grass had been
touched by any bare feet,

501
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,867
and there was nothing
to tell him that perhaps

502
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,327
she had been waiting for him.

503
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,623
And there was no smell of
flowers in the air either.

504
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:16,127
So, he went home to his
little house in the woods,

505
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,628
and he was not happy at all.

506
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,172
Before he went to
bed that night,

507
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,008
he hummed the four
remaining sounds

508
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:24,552
to see if he had
still four left.

509
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,762
And he forgot all about
saying his bedtime prayer

510
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,597
for his wife and
his little children.

511
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,643
And he did not sleep very
well at all that night.

512
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,354
And in the middle night, he
had a bad dream about losing

513
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:37,857
yet another one of
the beautiful sounds.

514
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,358
And he woke up and went outside

515
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:42,069
his little house and
repeated the sounds.

516
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:47,074
(soft music)
(bugs chirping)

517
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,292
And sure enough, he
had lost another one.

518
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,961
(eerie chiming)

519
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:09,138
Now, he had only three left.

520
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:17,063
(singing in foreign language)

521
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:44,799
And the next day, he did not
play the music sound game

522
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:47,551
when he went cutting
stone on the mountain.

523
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,261
He did not find
many stones either,

524
00:39:49,261 --> 00:39:51,680
and at the end of the
day he was tired and sad.

525
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,058
Even thinking about a new baby

526
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,935
did not help very much either.

527
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:58,771
The thoughts about the
arrival of the new baby

528
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,482
did not make him happy
and strong like before.

529
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:05,694
Because the sounds were missing
and he was afraid to use

530
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:08,781
the remaining three sounds
for fear he might lose them.

531
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:13,119
And as he walked down the
mountain at the end of the day,

532
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,329
he did not notice the
bird singing in trees.

533
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,497
(birds chirping)

534
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:19,917
Nor did he notice
the beautiful sunset.

535
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,878
He felt sad and tired and
he looked down at his feet

536
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:24,713
as he walked down
the mountain road,

537
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,467
back to his little
house under the trees.

538
00:40:28,467 --> 00:40:32,304
(singing in foreign language)

539
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,888
And then, he saw her.

540
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,515
(gentle music)

541
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,981
The child with the white
dress and the flowers,

542
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,400
the child with no
shoes tending to grass

543
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,236
on the side of the
road, just like that.

544
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:33,741
And her feet were bare and when
he looked at her feet again,

545
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:37,077
he saw that she was not
standing on the grass at all.

546
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:40,372
Her feet with no shoes
were just above the ground.

547
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,918
As a matter of fact, they did
not even touch the ground.

548
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:45,753
And then he understood
why he had not been able

549
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,506
to see her if she had
been there before.

550
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,383
And he also understood why
her feet never left marks

551
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:53,219
in the grass on the
side of the road.

552
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,559
And he told her about losing
the sounds one by one,

553
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,937
and how it made him sad.

554
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,438
And he told her how afraid
he was about losing them all,

555
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:07,358
because what is the use
if you receive something

556
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:11,237
that makes you happy, only
to feel sad when you lose it.

557
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,780
It is better not to
receive anything at all

558
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,615
because it will make you
very happy for a while,

559
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:18,536
and then when you don't have
it anymore, sadness comes.

560
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,790
And perhaps, it is best no
to be very happy or very sad.

561
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,125
It is a lot better perhaps,

562
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,795
if you were like everybody else.

563
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:29,046
Not too happy and not too sad.

564
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,306
And the child with the flower
crown looked at the poor

565
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,685
stonecutter with her
gray-green soul window eyes

566
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,686
and then she smiled.

567
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,439
And as she smiled,
the sun did it again.

568
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,317
The sun poured
liquid gold all over

569
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:51,860
her dress again, like before.

570
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,072
And some of the gold got
all over her face too.

571
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:58,826
She laid her hands
on the shoulders of
the tired stonecutter

572
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:01,203
and her hands were as
light as butterfly wings.

573
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,832
She looked deep into
his eyes with her green

574
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:08,711
soul window eyes and she said,
"I was supposed to give you

575
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:11,255
three magic sounds
only and no more.

576
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,966
But I game you seven so
that you could lose a few,

577
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,176
and still have three left.

578
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:19,680
And you have lost exactly the
sounds that you don't need.

579
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,349
And the three remaining
sounds will be yours

580
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,351
from now on, forevermore.

581
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:32,359
And now, I must teach you
how to use them correctly

582
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:33,777
and in the right order.

583
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,904
And when you use 'em
exactly as I will teach you,

584
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,825
then you will never be said
anymore as long as you live.

585
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:43,454
And all the time as she spoke,
her gray-green soul window

586
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,497
eyes looked way
deep inside of him.

587
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,584
And the girl with
the white dress,

588
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,837
she told him the secret
of how to use the sounds.

589
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:54,423
And they stood there for a long
time in the golden light of

590
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:58,052
the sun and little stars started
to dance all around them.

591
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,554
(gentle music)

592
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,226
And the child with
no shoes on her feet,

593
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:09,396
told the stonecutter
how to use the sounds.

594
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,815
And she warned him to use
'em in the correct order only

595
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,193
or the magic of the
sound would not work.

596
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,363
The way to see if the
magic of the three sounds

597
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,741
was still there would be
to look up into the sky,

598
00:44:20,741 --> 00:44:22,951
but only if the sky was blue.

599
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,329
And then he had to pick
two clouds and look between

600
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,538
the two clouds into
the blue of the sky

601
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,207
where the secret was.

602
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,502
The secret or the
magic of the sounds.

603
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:44,098
And he asked about the
golden dancing star also,

604
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:46,475
but she just smiled and
told him she would tell him

605
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,102
perhaps later, but not now.

606
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,606
And the stonecutter
understand everything.

607
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,316
And he thought he
was lucky to have met

608
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:56,860
the beautiful child
with no shoes.

609
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,279
And her looking inside
his soul through his eyes

610
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,698
made him happy and
he loved the child

611
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,741
with the green eyes very much.

612
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,743
Not at all in the same
way that he loved his wife

613
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:07,454
and his children and the
little house under the trees,

614
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,580
but differently.

615
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,709
He could not quite
explain why or how,

616
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,336
but it all made him feel
happy and contented.

617
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:19,758
And then, just as the sun went
to sleep behind a horizon,

618
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:23,762
the child with the white dress
disappeared, just like that.

619
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,141
He did not even see her go.

620
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,810
And the perfume of her
flower crown lingered on.

621
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,938
And he looked in the
grass and he remembered

622
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,857
that her feet never
touched the grass.

623
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,651
And he hummed his
three magic sounds

624
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:39,153
and they were all there.

625
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,156
And he walked down
the road to his

626
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,366
little thatched
house in the woods.

627
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,994
(gentle music)

628
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:11,685
The stonecutter
went to the mountain

629
00:46:11,685 --> 00:46:13,812
very early the next day.

630
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,647
He had hummed his
three magic sounds

631
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:18,025
a few times and
they were all there.

632
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:20,319
He would be working in a
different place on the mountain,

633
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,362
so he took the forest road.

634
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:23,906
And now, he wanted to rest a bit

635
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,033
before climbing the mountain.

636
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,036
He was happy with the three
sounds the child had given him.

637
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,873
But he was also a little
afraid that he might lose them,

638
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:37,252
like he had lost four of
the seven sounds before.

639
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,714
And from far away, he
heard the school bell

640
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:43,175
ringing three times.
(school bell ringing)

641
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,969
And then he heard the singing
of the children join in.

642
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:49,890
And they sang the three
sounds that the child

643
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:51,975
had told him would
be his forever more.

644
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,062
And he hit the stone
slab three times.

645
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,317
The sounds were the same.

646
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:05,614
They had been inside the stone
for a million years perhaps.

647
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:07,908
And if they had been
there for that long,

648
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,868
they would always be there.

649
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:13,914
And he knew that now he
would never lose them.

650
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:17,835
Never, ever as long as he lived.

651
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,009
(waterfall splashing)

652
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,642
(gentle music)

653
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:41,066
And day-in, day-out, the
stonecutter went to the mountain

654
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:43,235
to cut stone and he
never saw the child

655
00:47:43,235 --> 00:47:45,237
with the white dress again.

656
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,947
And he played the magic
sound game at the mountain

657
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,992
and the stones, and sometimes
he would find very small

658
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,786
stones that looked like
the eyes of the child.

659
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:54,621
And then he thought of
her and her flower crown

660
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,956
and her feet with no shoes.

661
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,126
And the new baby came.

662
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,795
And he wished he could show
the new baby to the child,

663
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,589
and he was happy
with the new baby

664
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,174
and he worked a little harder.

665
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,634
And he grew a little older,

666
00:48:07,634 --> 00:48:11,138
but he did not mind the
hard work and the small pay.

667
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,307
And as he grew older still,

668
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:16,894
he realized that he now had
less time left in his life.

669
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,937
But he did not mind
that too much either.

670
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,571
But it seemed that the mountain

671
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,990
did not ever grow any smaller,

672
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:32,534
no matter how much and how
long he would cut stone.

673
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,829
Sometimes he would make a
mistake with the music sounds

674
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,665
and the sun would be
hot on his back again.

675
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:42,085
And at the end of the day he
would be tired like before.

676
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:45,005
And then, one day, he
whistled the magic sounds,

677
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,257
but they did not come out right.

678
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,550
They were not in
the correct order

679
00:48:48,550 --> 00:48:50,510
that the child had told him.

680
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:53,639
And he could not get them
to go right all day long.

681
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,683
And he became tired again
and the sun was very hot too.

682
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:04,274
The next day, the sun was even
hotter, especially at noon.

683
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,611
The stonecutter was tired
and unhappy and he looked up

684
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,114
at the sun and he wished
that he could become the sun,

685
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,033
'cause then he could
shine on everything

686
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,369
and nobody would be
stronger than him.

687
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:17,412
He would shine on the
fields and the trees,

688
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,705
and he would shine
on the people,

689
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:20,582
and he would shine
on the mountain,

690
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:22,417
and he would shine all day long.

691
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,002
And he would be so hot in
the middle of the day when

692
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:27,422
he would be high in the sky,
that people would have to go

693
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:30,300
and sit under a
shady tree just to be

694
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,885
sheltered from his rays.

695
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,388
And he became the sun.

696
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:38,016
(gentle music)

697
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:05,711
(upbeat music)
(birds chirping)

698
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,773
And he was happy again.

699
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:30,068
And everyday, he had to
go to work like before,

700
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,779
but now he, himself,
was the sun.

701
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,490
And the stonecutter
who had become the sun,

702
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,951
had to do all sorts of
things that were different

703
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,703
from what he was used to.

704
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,455
He had to rise
early in the morning

705
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,416
and he had to color the
entire surface of the sea.

706
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:58,597
And then, he had to color the
tops of the highest trees,

707
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,849
and work his way down with
the colors all the way

708
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,184
to the little drops
of dew in the grass

709
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:04,561
that grew at the foot
of the big mountain.

710
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,230
Then he had to wake
up the roosters.

711
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,482
(rooster crowing)
And the roosters

712
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,984
would wake up the chickens.

713
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:11,985
And then he had to
wake up the birds

714
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:14,654
that slept in the trees.

715
00:51:14,654 --> 00:51:16,698
And then he had to turn
the flowers with his rays,

716
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,909
and that was a lot of work
too because he had to keep

717
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:21,244
on doing that all day
long with some of them,

718
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,622
right till he went to
sleep behind the horizon.

719
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:27,918
And to keep the flowers happy
and contented so that they

720
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,711
would make nice
perfumes all day long

721
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,005
was a great responsibility.

722
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,550
But the stonecutter
who had become the sun,

723
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:40,013
did all his new work happily
and with great pleasure.

724
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:49,606
But what he loved most was
shining his rays on the mountain

725
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,818
at the end of the day 'cause
then he could light up all

726
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,402
the color of the
beautiful stones

727
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:55,779
on the face of the mountain.

728
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:59,366
And as he did so, he hummed
his three magic sounds

729
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,867
very, very softly.

730
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,704
And the sounds were in
the right order again.

731
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,249
And with the music magic,
the colors became even more

732
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:10,168
beautiful when he touched
them with his rays.

733
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,004
There were the beautiful
reds of the rubies,

734
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,006
the sky blue colors
of the turquoises,

735
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,050
and the diamonds were of a
beautiful sparkling white

736
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,635
like the dress of the child.

737
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:22,222
Then there was the deep dark
blue which was the same color

738
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,849
of the ocean when it gets angry.

739
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,226
And the pink of
the golden clouds

740
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,936
when the setting
sun shines on them.

741
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,565
There was also the green of
the emeralds which were like

742
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,568
the eyes of the child that have
given him the magic sounds.

743
00:52:38,155 --> 00:52:40,407
And at night, he would go
to sleep just below the line

744
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,201
that is between the
sea and the sky.

745
00:52:43,201 --> 00:52:46,079
And he slept well and
content and happily dreaming

746
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,415
about doing his work
even better the next day.

747
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,501
And he thought he was
very lucky to be the sun,

748
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:54,254
and to have all the sounds
back in the right order,

749
00:52:54,254 --> 00:52:55,964
just like the
child had told him.

750
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:01,052
He was happy to be the sun and
not the stonecutter anymore.

751
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:09,436
(singing in foreign language)
The stonecutter had not

752
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,313
come home for three days now.

753
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:16,109
And for three days,
old Thomas had come

754
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:18,069
to feed the birds
early in the morning.

755
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,407
Sometimes he brought some fruit

756
00:53:22,407 --> 00:53:25,535
for the stonecutter's family.

757
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,746
And once or twice he'd
give 'em some fish

758
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,624
he'd caught the night before.

759
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,460
They had not seen
the stonecutter.

760
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,847
Every morning, the
children went to school,

761
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:48,808
but they had not
seen their father.

762
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:56,858
And at meal time, his place
had stayed and stayed empty.

763
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:02,530
So, in the afternoon
of the fourth day,

764
00:54:02,530 --> 00:54:04,824
they went looking for him.

765
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:07,077
They walked down the road
until they got to the glade,

766
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,913
but the stonecutter
was not there.

767
00:54:09,913 --> 00:54:12,290
And there was nothing to
show them that perhaps

768
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:17,128
he had been there on
any of the days before.

769
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:20,173
And near the place where
he usually did his work,

770
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:21,967
they found his tools.

771
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,177
His bag was still there,

772
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:26,012
but none of the food
had been touched.

773
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:29,849
(singing in foreign language)

774
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,043
And near the waterfall,

775
00:54:57,043 --> 00:55:01,464
his son found some drinking
nuts and his knife.

776
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,759
But the stonecutter
was not there either.

777
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:08,596
(singing in foreign language)

778
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:19,065
And the sky turned gold
with the setting of the sun,

779
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:22,027
but they did not notice
the beautiful sunset

780
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:25,238
because they were
sad and disappointed.

781
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:37,625
(waves crashing)
(singing in foreign language)

782
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:43,423
And then, one day, there
appeared a little cloud

783
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:44,924
on the horizon.

784
00:55:44,924 --> 00:55:48,470
The cloud started to grow and
it became bigger and bigger.

785
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:52,432
And the bigger it grew,
the darker the sky became.

786
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,392
The sun tried to
melt the cloud away,

787
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:56,603
but it just became
bigger and bigger.

788
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,480
The cloud started to make rain.

789
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,774
First of all, a little bit
of rain so that the sun

790
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,442
could make a nice
rainbow with it,

791
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,736
but then the cloud started
to make real big rains

792
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,946
and the entire sky became dark.

793
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:09,240
And now, the cloud
covered the entire sky.

794
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,286
And then, the cloud started
to make really big rains,

795
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:16,247
bigger than anybody
had ever seen before.

796
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,957
When the rains became
bigger and bigger,

797
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:20,085
the rivers became big
with the rain also.

798
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,630
Soon the rivers turned
angry with all the rain,

799
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,590
and the winds got angry too.

800
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,592
It started to rain even harder,

801
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:30,220
and the sun could
not do anything about
it because the cloud

802
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,223
had become so big that the sun
could not get through at all.

803
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,227
And after it had rained
many days and many nights,

804
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:40,188
the sun said, "I'm
tired of all this rain.

805
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:43,483
The cloud with all the
rain is stronger than I am.

806
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:48,488
I wish I was the cloud."

807
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:56,830
And he became the cloud.
(rain pattering)

808
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:03,711
(singing in foreign language)

809
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:29,487
And he slowly drifted
along in the sky,

810
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,531
and the sky became blue again.

811
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:32,824
And when the sky was blue,

812
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,535
the cloud let the sun
shine in the blue sky.

813
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,705
The cloud knew he was very
strong and he happily chanted

814
00:57:38,705 --> 00:57:40,790
the three magic music sounds.

815
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:42,417
The cloud knew it was
stronger than the sun

816
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,586
because it just knew
that it could turn black

817
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,838
and angry anytime he wanted to.

818
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:48,673
Everything went back to normal.

819
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,510
(singing in foreign language)

820
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:15,700
(light music)

821
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,876
And then, one fine
day, the cloud thought,

822
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:27,670
"Why don't I see if I'm
really stronger than the sun

823
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,464
and the mountain
and everybody else.

824
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:33,092
I will just start to rain a
bit more and see how black

825
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,761
and important I can become."

826
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:39,224
He liked the idea very much and
he became very big and black

827
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:41,184
and then he drifted
in front of the sun.

828
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:44,229
And the sun got scared and
tried into that part of the sky

829
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:45,647
that was still clear.

830
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:50,443
That made the cloud so mad,
and he told the angry winds

831
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,820
to blow and the
angry winds blew over

832
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:54,447
the waves of the great ocean,

833
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:56,908
and it became a personal
battle between the cloud

834
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:00,119
and the sun to see who
was the most powerful.

835
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,830
And that made the cloud
even more mad and he said,

836
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,625
"Now, I will really get dark
and nasty and I will make

837
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:09,045
big rains bigger than anybody
has ever seen before."

838
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,881
And that is exactly what he did.

839
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,383
(water rushing)

840
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:15,218
And he rained so much that
all the flowers drowned

841
00:59:15,218 --> 00:59:17,929
with the rain and the rivers
got angry with the rains.

842
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,808
And the sun ran away
because he got scared,

843
00:59:21,808 --> 00:59:23,768
and the cloud rained
on everything.

844
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:27,313
And the cloud rained very
hard on the mountain, too.

845
00:59:28,189 --> 00:59:30,149
But the mountain did not move.

846
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,651
And that made the
cloud even madder

847
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,820
and the cloud started to
rain on the mountain so hard

848
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,697
that the mountain
started to cry.

849
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:38,116
But the mountain did not move.

850
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,910
It just stood there and cried.

851
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:44,831
And when the mountain cried,
it made beautiful waterfalls

852
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,209
and the waterfalls washed all
the stones nice and clean.

853
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:51,170
The colored stones did
not shine as beautiful

854
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:54,674
as when the sun would shine
on them at sunset time,

855
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,260
but the waterfalls were so
beautiful that many people came

856
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,470
and looked at them and
they tried to count them,

857
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:03,224
but there was so many that
people lost count all the time.

858
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,184
And everybody said
that the mountain

859
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,562
had made waterfalls
of great beauty.

860
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:10,648
And that made the
cloud very jealous.

861
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:14,694
And he said, "The mountain
is stronger than I am.

862
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,237
I want to become the mountain."

863
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:20,533
And he became the mountain.

864
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:25,538
(birds chirping)
(rain pattering)

865
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,878
(singing in foreign language)

866
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:01,866
(light flute music)

867
01:01:01,866 --> 01:01:05,870
And then, early one morning,
after the sun had started to

868
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:09,040
paint the tops of the trees and
before the roosters woke up,

869
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,794
a man walked from his little
thatched hut in the woods.

870
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:14,962
He had kissed his wife
and his children who were

871
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,423
still asleep in the little
house under the trees.

872
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:20,385
Asleep warm, happy,
and contented.

873
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,930
And he took the basket
with the food that his wife

874
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:25,807
had prepared for him
the night before.

875
01:01:27,266 --> 01:01:30,269
And the man went to the mountain
and started to get stones.

876
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:32,980
(chisel clanking)

877
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,608
(light music)

878
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:39,112
The mountain woke up, of course,
and he saw the stonecutter.

879
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:42,281
But the mountain did
not care one bit.

880
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,953
He thought, "I will let
him cut stone from me

881
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,621
for a little while.

882
01:01:48,621 --> 01:01:52,250
I am so big that nobody will
know the difference anyway.

883
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,626
But I don't mind."

884
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:59,799
The mountain thought that
the stonecutter would soon

885
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,342
get tired and would
have to stop at midday

886
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,345
would the sun would become
too hot and burn his back.

887
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:08,850
Then the middle of the day
came and the stonecutter went

888
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,769
and sat under the shade
of a tree and ate the food

889
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:14,480
that his wife had
prepared for him.

890
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,024
(gentle music)

891
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:25,992
Then, the stonecutter rested a
while and when he was rested,

892
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,327
he went back to work
and cut more stone

893
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,371
until well after sunset.

894
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,665
And the stonecutter
came back the next day

895
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,876
and the next and the next,

896
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:38,045
and he kept on cutting
stone day-in and day-out.

897
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,841
And the mountain did not
think that was very funny.

898
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:46,012
The stonecutter kept on
coming back day after day,

899
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:49,515
and that started to make
the mountain a little mad.

900
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:51,142
And when the mountain got mad,

901
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:54,437
he tried to make the magic
sounds, but they came out wrong

902
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:57,774
because they always come
out wrong when you're mad.

903
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:01,235
And the mountain told the
sun to shine a little harder,

904
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,613
so that the stonecutter
would get hot and tired

905
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:05,865
and would stop cutting stone.

906
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:09,035
But the stonecutter kept on
cutting stone just like before.

907
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:13,206
He did not mind the sun and
the sun could not stop him.

908
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,249
And that made the
mountain even more mad.

909
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:19,962
And the mountain tried to make
the magic music sounds again,

910
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:22,089
but he got them all
backwards this time.

911
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:24,091
They just did not
come out right at all.

912
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,889
The mountain was very strong,

913
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:31,724
but nobody really
loved the mountain.

914
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:35,061
Sure, everybody admired
the mountain very much,

915
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,396
but nobody really loved the
mountain like the family

916
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,649
of the stonecutter
loved the stonecutter.

917
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:43,861
And finally, the big
mountain had to admit,

918
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,906
the stonecutter is
stronger than I am.

919
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:49,283
And the mountain wished
he was a stonecutter.

920
01:03:50,785 --> 01:03:53,079
And he became the stonecutter.

921
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,665
(gentle music)

922
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:06,092
(soft relaxing music)

923
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:14,851
The stonecutter had asked
Hiro to come to the mountain

924
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,353
and finish the
tattoo on his arm.

925
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,355
And when Hiro found
him near the waterfall,

926
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,815
he was sound asleep.

927
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,735
So, he laid out his tools
and he waited a while.

928
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,369
Then, he started to
work on the tattoo.

929
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,413
The gentle tapping
woke up the stonecutter

930
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,999
and he told Hiro
about his dream.

931
01:04:37,999 --> 01:04:40,293
In his dream, he had
been the mountain.

932
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,629
He was very strong and
very, very powerful.

933
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:46,090
But he had found out that
when you have that much power,

934
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,550
nobody loves you anymore.

935
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:52,597
Sure, everybody or almost
everybody admires you very much

936
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:54,515
because of all the
power you have,

937
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:58,352
but nobody really loves you.

938
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:02,481
And when nobody loves
you, you get very lonely.

939
01:05:02,481 --> 01:05:05,359
Sure, you are too strong to
admit that you are very lonely

940
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,653
and you pretend
it doesn't matter.

941
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:11,407
But being lonely
is no fun at all.

942
01:05:11,407 --> 01:05:12,992
Now the tattoo was finished.

943
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:19,832
And as they walked back home,

944
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:23,628
Hiro told him that the circle
of his life was now completed.

945
01:05:23,628 --> 01:05:26,380
And the stonecutter remembered
how lonely he had been

946
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,883
when he was the
mountain in his dream.

947
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:31,719
And then he thought of
his wife and children,

948
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:33,387
and those birds on the beach,

949
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:35,056
and the fishing with old Thomas.

950
01:05:36,265 --> 01:05:38,184
And he thought, it
is better to have

951
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:40,019
love than power anytime.

952
01:05:42,563 --> 01:05:43,898
And as they walked
down the mountain,

953
01:05:43,898 --> 01:05:46,692
the sound of the singing
got closer and closer.

954
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,987
The stonecutter
was happy not to be

955
01:05:49,987 --> 01:05:52,448
the big lonely mountain anymore.

956
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,575
And all of a sudden, he
noticed that the grass

957
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,828
seemed greener, much,
much greener than before.

958
01:05:57,828 --> 01:06:02,750
(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)

959
01:07:17,533 --> 01:07:21,620
And he thought, this
moment, this very moment,

960
01:07:21,620 --> 01:07:23,873
right now and here,
is going to be

961
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:25,332
the beginning of my new life.

962
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:31,130
(singing in foreign language)

963
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:32,381
And then he thought
about his wife

964
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,924
and children and the new baby.

965
01:07:33,924 --> 01:07:37,303
He said to himself, "I will
bring them all to the glade

966
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:39,597
and I will show them
where the sounds are.

967
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,140
And when they will
hear the sounds,

968
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,975
I can tell them about the
girl with the white dress

969
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,061
and the flowers on her head."

970
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:49,190
And you could tell from
the joy in his heart,

971
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:52,109
that his new life had begun.

972
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:55,946
(singing in foreign language)

973
01:08:11,879 --> 01:08:16,884
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

974
01:08:42,910 --> 01:08:44,411
(pickax clinking)

975
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:46,789
Then the stonecutter cut
stone on the big mountain.

976
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,458
And the work was hard
and the pay was low,

977
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,169
and sometimes he would be
very tired as he grew older.

978
01:08:53,462 --> 01:08:55,923
And the sun was hot
and burned his back,

979
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:59,385
but he came back to cut stone
day after day after day.

980
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,303
And after a long, long
day of cutting stone,

981
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:03,889
he would go back to the little
thatched hut in the woods

982
01:09:03,889 --> 01:09:05,724
where he lived with his family.

983
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:10,104
And they ate well and
cheaply, and they slept well

984
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:13,065
and contented in their
little house in the woods.

985
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:14,733
And they all loved each other.

986
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:22,241
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

987
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,164
Well, hear your story.

988
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,750
The story of the stonecutter
who thought he was poor,

989
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:34,128
but who was not really
very poor at all.

990
01:09:34,128 --> 01:09:36,297
And had to learn not
to be discontented.

991
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,342
And if sometimes you
feel sad or unhappy,

992
01:09:40,342 --> 01:09:41,802
then you can listen to the story

993
01:09:41,802 --> 01:09:44,388
because you know that
the lesson is true.

994
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:47,433
And perhaps one day, you'll
meet a child with no shoes

995
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,143
and the flower crown
and the white dress

996
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,228
with the gold
poured all over it.

997
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:53,230
And perhaps she
will smile at you

998
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,733
with her green soul window eyes.

999
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:58,277
And perhaps she will
tell you the secret of

1000
01:09:58,277 --> 01:10:01,322
the three magic sounds and the
little golden dancing star.

1001
01:10:02,823 --> 01:10:04,325
But I cannot promise you that.

1002
01:10:07,828 --> 01:10:10,539
And in this world,
neither can anyone else.

1003
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:22,343
(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

1004
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:45,110
(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)

1005
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:27,374
(upbeat music)
(singing in foreign language)
