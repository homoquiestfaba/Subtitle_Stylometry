1
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,550
<i>Like all things on this hurtling sphere...</i>

2
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,380
<i>...I emerged from the molten center
of creation.</i>

3
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:37,420
<i>But mine has been a unique path.</i>

4
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,930
<i>Isolated, I developed attributes
beyond those of lesser beings.</i>

5
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,630
<i>Then the sphere was struck
by a vast celestial stone.</i>

6
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,050
<i>Black chunks of death filled the skies...</i>

7
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,930
<i>...and the world
became a chaotic garden of doom.</i>

8
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:06,260
<i>Soon the sphere began
to nurture new kinds of life.</i>

9
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,140
<i>And there was one
that stood above all the rest.</i>

10
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,420
<i>Its fragile shell belied its vicious nature.</i>

11
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,510
<i>And in what seemed like a heartbeat...</i>

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,010
<i>...these things proliferated in both number
and destructive means.</i>

13
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>Now they have harnessed
the most destructive force.</i>

14
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,930
<i>And I, The Centre, have concluded...</i>

15
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,720
<i>...that the sphere
must be cleansed of them.</i>

16
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,970
<i>This is Lois Lane on Armed Forces Radio.</i>

17
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,970
<i>Well, boys, it looks like the party's over.
They signed the ceasefire.</i>

18
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,590
<i>So have a drink and smoke them
if you got them.</i>

19
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:14,140
<i>We're going home.</i>

20
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:24,140
Some way to end a war, huh, kid?
Nobody wins, nobody loses.

21
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,800
Long as it's over, Ace. I got plans.

22
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:29,460
Right, I forgot.
You're gonna be a space ranger.

23
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,220
The proper term is "test pilot,"
funny man.

24
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,970
I'm gonna see the stars, close up.

25
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,880
Hey.

26
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,970
Sons of bitches must not have heard
about the ceasefire.

27
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,340
<i>I'm coming back for you.
Try using your guns for a change.</i>

28
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,970
<i>Can you make it back now, Ace?</i>

29
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,760
Roger that.
Gotta get me a new pair of skivvies.

30
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,260
Got another bogey.

31
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,670
<i>Hal, your engine.</i>

32
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,180
<i>Punch out. Punch out!</i>

33
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,300
Listen to me. War over.

34
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,050
Finished.

35
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,760
It's over.

36
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,010
War over.

37
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,930
I'm so sorry.

38
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,090
All I wanted was to send a signal
to Mars.

39
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,970
How could I have known
it would teleport you here?

40
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,970
I suppose we both got the shock
of our lives.

41
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,930
But your heart must be stronger
than mine.

42
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,880
Whoever you are...

43
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,970
...forgive me.

44
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:30,670
Come on in, Kal.

45
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:33,180
Join the celebration.

46
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,880
Diana, what's going on here?

47
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,460
Tell them they'd be wasting their bullets.

48
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,800
Don't judge them, KaI.
They get a little nervous around men now.

49
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:46,550
What are you talking about?
-I was heading upriver...

50
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,050
...when I passed this village
about four days ago.

51
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,050
The people here helped the French.
The rebels didn't like that.

52
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:55,380
They murdered the men and children
and they threw them in the river.

53
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,010
<i>These women were beaten and penned
in tiger cages for the rebels to use.</i>

54
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,300
<i>The rebels, how did they die?</i>

55
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,970
<i>I only disarmed them.</i>

56
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,880
<i>I left their guns in a clearing and
then I let the women out of their cages.</i>

57
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,140
They did this?

58
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,340
And you just stood by and watched?

59
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,760
I gave them freedom
and a chance for justice.

60
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,140
You know, the American way.

61
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:30,140
This is what the government's afraid of,
Diana.

62
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,380
Us acting like vigilantes.

63
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,550
I have to do what I think is right.

64
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,220
That's what the others said at first,
remember?

65
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,760
And now Batman's a fugitive,
the whole Justice Society's retired...

66
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,880
...and Hourman's dead.

67
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,840
No matter how much good we do...

68
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:48,050
...deep down, people are always
going to be scared of us.

69
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,220
Isn't that why you and I
signed those loyalty oaths?

70
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,720
Take a look around, Kal.

71
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,340
Oaths don't mean much here.

72
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,760
All I see is suffering and madness.

73
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:01,460
But...
-There's the door, spaceman.

74
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,760
Yeah.

75
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

76
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,510
Yeah.

77
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,630
<i>The downed pilot insisted
the island was teeming with dinosaurs...</i>

78
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,180
<i>...but Navy sources claim
a search revealed...</i>

79
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:03,090
<i>...that not only were there no dinosaurs,
there wasn't even an island.</i>

80
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,630
<i>In other news-</i>

81
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,010
<i>Well, I don't know, Groucho,
that's not really what I meant.</i>

82
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:11,510
<i>We keep our farm animals in the farm,
not in the house.</i>

83
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,970
<i>Not in the bedroom, certainly.</i>

84
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,800
<i>Eh, what's up, doc?</i>

85
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:25,180
<i>This now concludes our broadcasting day.</i>

86
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:35,550
The last I heard,
she went back to Paradise Island.

87
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:37,590
It sounds like she's lost her mind.

88
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,550
I don't think it's that simple.

89
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,050
Diana's an Amazon
who's become an American.

90
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,550
She's trying to make sense
of her convictions.

91
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,670
Between her and that Batman character...

92
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,720
I thought these people were your friends.
-They are.

93
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,970
But neither of them would sacrifice
their principles for a friend.

94
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,380
Ever since McCarthy came to-
-McCarthy. He's no excuse.

95
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,880
Whatever party, whatever administration,
there'll always be boogeymen like him.

96
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:04,840
We need our heroes to stand up...

97
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:08,340
...and show us what this country
is supposed to mean.

98
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,050
We need a leader.

99
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:34,220
Come on, rolI it.
Come on, eight. Come on, eight.

100
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes.

101
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,670
Ten's the number to win.

102
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,340
Now why don't you tell me
what we're doing here, Ace?

103
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,090
Told you, HaI, it's a surprise.

104
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,800
You'll find out tomorrow.

105
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,380
Now, roll those dice before they cool off.

106
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,720
Come on, 10.

107
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,180
Ten. It's a winner.

108
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,880
And you have the loveliest light
in your eyes, dig?

109
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:07,630
Can we get back to the interview, please?
-Oh, yeah. My philosophy of life.

110
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,050
Tell your readers they gotta do what I do,
live for the moment...

111
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,220
...because it might be our last,
you dig, Miss West?

112
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,550
Very profound.
-That's me.

113
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,970
I've always been, you know,
deep like that.

114
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:23,550
Time for the sound check, boss.

115
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,930
Back in a moment.

116
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,460
I'll try to live for it.

117
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:37,840
<i>I tell you, these two heavyweights
are giving us quite a show tonight.</i>

118
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,380
<i>Oh, it looks like it'Il have to wait
for the next round, folks.</i>

119
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,090
<i>Meantime, we've got the champ...</i>

120
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,550
<i>...Ted "Wildcat" Grant,
solidly ahead on points.</i>

121
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,180
<i>Uh, hello.
-Hello, Barry?</i>

122
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:50,590
Iris. I thought you had to work tonight.

123
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,010
I do.

124
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,630
But I wanted to tell you
how much I miss you.

125
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,460
You have no idea.
-Come on, how could you miss me?

126
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:00,760
You're in Las Vegas interviewing
all those singers and movie stars.

127
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:01,970
<i>It's the fast lane.</i>

128
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:05,590
There are lots of potholes
in that lane, let me tell you.

129
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,180
Iris? Iris.

130
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,720
Sorry to interrupt your festivities,
but if you all stay calm...

131
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:25,010
...we'll be gone as soon as my friends here
come back from the cashiers' booths.

132
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,380
The key phrase was "stay calm. "

133
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,970
<i>Iris, what's happening?</i>

134
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,670
You there.

135
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,720
The naughty girl on the phone.

136
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,140
Iris!

137
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:06,760
Just a few more seconds, everyone.

138
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,090
Ah, my ride is here.

139
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
Wait.

140
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,340
Make it quick.

141
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:33,340
Hot damn, Ace.
It's that super-fast guy from CentraI City.

142
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,590
The Flash. He'll take care of this clown.

143
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,140
I took precautions
in case you dropped by.

144
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,930
If you so much as touch me...

145
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,420
...you'Il trigger six cryogenic bombs
I've hidden around the city.

146
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,140
And they'll go off in 90 seconds anyway,
unless you find them.

147
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:53,460
So it's your choice now.
Me, or the city and everyone in it.

148
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:55,800
Eighty-nine, 88-

149
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,050
One...

150
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,930
...two, three, four...

151
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,930
...five. Where's six?

152
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,720
It took me a second or two,
but I figured out the sixth bomb...

153
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,670
...was just a wild-goose chase.

154
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,720
You are different
from the other lesser beings. Faster.

155
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,880
Why?
-Lesser beings?

156
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,380
What are you talking about?

157
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:12,720
Eh? Wha-?

158
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,670
What did you do?

159
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,180
I rewired it on the way down.

160
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,510
Don't ever mess with my Iris.

161
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,460
This little trip's been fun.

162
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:13,840
Are you ever gonna tell me
where we're headed?

163
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:17,090
To hell if you don't slow down.
What's wrong with you?

164
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,760
Ever since you got out of the hospitaI...

165
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,800
It was Korea.

166
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:23,930
Changed everything.

167
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,090
Wars have a tendency to do that.

168
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,800
Look, Ace, you know
that ever since I was a kid...

169
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,550
...watching my old man fly,
I wanted to see the stars.

170
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,880
But the war and then the hospital...

171
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,380
...it's like I'm damaged goods.

172
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:41,300
I can't get a first-class outfit
to take me on. And without a ride...

173
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,460
...I sure can't climb the pyramid.

174
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,460
Slow down.
-Why bother?

175
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:49,670
You have to, kid, because we're here.

176
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,180
It's where you get your second chance.

177
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,670
<i>How did you know he was the commie?</i>

178
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,010
<i>He came back for the formula,
that's what nailed it.</i>

179
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,880
<i>He could've killed you.</i>

180
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,670
<i>Like I always say,
when you know you're right...</i>

181
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:19,670
<i>...it's worth taking a chance.</i>

182
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,180
<i>Now, come here.</i>

183
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,880
Ace Morgan's recommendation
carries a lot of weight at Ferris Aircraft.

184
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,220
I assume he spoke as well of us to you.

185
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:53,050
He did. And I can't imagine anywhere else
I'd rather be right now, Miss Ferris.

186
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,550
Do you have any questions?

187
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,720
I'm surprised your father
isn't interviewing me.

188
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,720
Not that I mind, it's just that you're a-
-A woman?

189
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,880
My father trusts me with the day-to-day
operation of the company.

190
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:09,090
If that's good enough for him, it ought to-
-Whoa, wait.

191
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,840
I was only saying that you're a little young
to be running a major corporation.

192
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:16,590
Oh. Oh, you're good, flyboy...

193
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,090
...but save it for the girls
in the typing pool.

194
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,590
One last question.

195
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,380
In your resume, there's a gap
between July and December of '53.

196
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,380
I was in a VA hospitaI.

197
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:28,590
Psych ward.

198
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:33,590
Most people wouldn't talk about
this kind of thing...

199
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,720
...but I learned a lot about myself there.

200
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,930
I came out knowing who I really am
and what I really want.

201
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,380
You report for training
and security clearance in two weeks.

202
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:45,670
All right, let's celebrate.

203
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,010
Waiter, some champagne.

204
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,510
Look, HaI,
I don't get involved with my employees.

205
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,760
I understand, Carol...

206
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,220
...but I don't start work
for two more weeks.

207
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,180
Two glasses.

208
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:06,670
So where'd this hot tip come from, John?
-A source.

209
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,800
WelI, I think I know your secret.

210
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,050
You do?
-Hm.

211
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,220
The tips you get from out of the blue...

212
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,220
...those hunches of yours
that always turn out to be right.

213
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,260
You're dating a fortuneteller.

214
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:22,090
No, I-

215
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,800
Something like that.

216
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,760
Try the back.
I'll see if I can pick this lock.

217
00:22:25,670 --> 00:22:27,090
You are the tribute.

218
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,930
Yours is the glory
of nourishing the strength...

219
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,260
...of The Centre.

220
00:22:44,090 --> 00:22:46,010
You okay, John?

221
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:57,420
No, stay away.

222
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,380
Stay away!

223
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,260
Back off, you're scaring the boy.

224
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,840
You'll be alI right now that-

225
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,930
You wilI be judged too.

226
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,140
You wilI all be judged.

227
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:22,180
Without The Centre, there is no holding.

228
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,010
The Centre? What's The Centre?

229
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,840
<i>Jordan, do you copy?</i>

230
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,840
<i>Negative, Colonel Flagg, no Jordan here...</i>

231
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,970
<i>-... just Spam in a can.
Cut the comedy.</i>

232
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,630
Are you go for 72?

233
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,840
<i>Yes, Captain Personality.</i>

234
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:06,460
<i>Jordan is go for exercise 72.</i>

235
00:24:06,930 --> 00:24:09,800
<i>Hit it.
-My pleasure.</i>

236
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:34,340
Spam Jordan is now go for exercise 73.

237
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,970
How's he doing?
-He's tough enough, that's for sure.

238
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,260
But I'm getting sick of his attitude.
-He's a pilot, ColoneI Flagg.

239
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:43,800
He's used to making decisions
and being in control.

240
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,970
This training goes against his nature.

241
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,510
Can't be helped.
It's all part of the big picture.

242
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:51,180
Which he hasn't seen yet.

243
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,630
CaroI.

244
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:01,010
I mean, Miss Ferris, afternoon.

245
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,420
Afternoon, Mr. Jordan.
I trust ColoneI Flagg is keeping you busy.

246
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,380
This stuff? Child's play, Miss Ferris.

247
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,510
Perhaps later I could show you-
Jordan.

248
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:12,090
What?
-Exercise 73, remember?

249
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,880
Yeah, they tell me 73's the charm.

250
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:17,050
Good day, Miss Ferris.

251
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,880
What are his numbers, Harry?
-Uh...

252
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,010
Excellent.
Responses in the 99th percentile.

253
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,010
Hm.

254
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:46,340
Not that I'm complaining,
but where exactly are you taking me?

255
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,220
Where have you always wanted to go?
-That's a leading question.

256
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,220
No, I mean, since you were a kid.

257
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:55,510
Your big goal?
-The stars.

258
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,670
But at the rate we're going, the Russians
are gonna beat us into orbit by months.

259
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,300
Who said anything about orbit?

260
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,180
Whoa!

261
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:21,840
A hole in the ground.

262
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,840
Isn't that the wrong direction?

263
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,220
Sometimes you have to go through hell
to get to heaven.

264
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,760
What is all this?

265
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,760
Welcome to the reaI Ferris Aircraft.

266
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:02,420
See that sour-looking man down there?

267
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,880
He'Il explain everything.

268
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,260
His name's Faraday.

269
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,630
Works for the government.

270
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,880
And if you like Rick Flagg,
you'll love him.

271
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,050
You're weak, erratic, emotional...

272
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:20,460
...and for my money, at least a little pink.
But I'm told you're the best we've got.

273
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,590
I...
-You keep your mouth shut...

274
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:25,050
...and your ears open.

275
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:28,510
I'm about to share some of this nation's
greatest secrets with you.

276
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,800
Couple of years ago, we found the body
of a radical scientist named Erdel...

277
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,180
...in a small observatory near Gotham.

278
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:47,140
Somehow,
he'd been able to contact Mars.

279
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,460
Mars? You're joking, right?

280
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:54,050
Yes, Jordan, I'm a real kidder.

281
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,510
We found this footprint
at the observatory.

282
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:01,340
Did you find what made that print?

283
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,590
No.

284
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:06,630
Whatever it is,
it's eluded us for two years.

285
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:09,090
There's life on Mars, Jordan.

286
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,970
And it's come to Earth.

287
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,970
Look, I'm just a pilot.
What does this have to do with me?

288
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,300
You haven't figured it out yet?

289
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,380
We've got to know what these Martians
want from us...

290
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:31,220
...and since we can't find them
here on Earth...

291
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,140
...we're going to Mars.

292
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,550
Outstanding.

293
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,590
Welcome home, Mr. Jones.

294
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:51,760
Why didn't I-?

295
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,930
Why didn't you sense me as you do others?

296
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,340
That's my secret.

297
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,840
Why are you here?
Because of The Centre?

298
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,460
The cult's spreading all over the world.

299
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:05,840
At first I thought it might be
the communists.

300
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,140
But they're having trouble
with the cults too.

301
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,670
It's not ideologicaI.

302
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,970
There's some kind
of psychic force involved.

303
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:14,590
It's affecting people
with high susceptibility.

304
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:17,220
Getting into their minds.

305
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,590
I felt it.

306
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:22,090
Yes, your feelings. How-?

307
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,420
Let's just say that's my secret.

308
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,420
You came here because
you want to work together, true?

309
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,140
True.
-Then we'll share our information.

310
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,800
I've already collected some.

311
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:38,930
Newspaper clippings.

312
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:41,260
You'll have to do better than that.

313
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,800
And one other thing, I'm not sure
what you are or where you come from...

314
00:29:46,970 --> 00:29:50,050
...but my instincts tell me
you're to be trusted.

315
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,050
Make no mistake, though.

316
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,840
I have a $70,000 sliver
of radioactive meteor...

317
00:29:55,010 --> 00:29:56,630
...to stop the one from Metropolis.

318
00:29:56,970 --> 00:30:01,010
With you, all I need is a penny
for a book of matches.

319
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,760
What's the matter, Grodd,
feeling starved for attention?

320
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,220
You're government property now, swifty.

321
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:55,180
We're gonna find out
what makes you tick.

322
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,720
Hey.
Did you see that?

323
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,760
Where did he go?

324
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:17,380
What you got there, John?

325
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,010
A kids' book?
-Not exactly.

326
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:22,590
The author committed suicide
a while back.

327
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,760
He thought the world was about to end.

328
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:26,840
You like this weird stuff, don't you?

329
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,300
WelI, you should see what they got
in the interrogation room.

330
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,260
He shot a cop on the parkway.

331
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,090
Then we found his mother...

332
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,090
...in his trunk.

333
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,550
Mental case?
-Not your typical one.

334
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,180
This guy's a scientist.

335
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:48,010
You're here to kill me, aren't you?
You're part of it.

336
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,260
I'm not going to kill you.

337
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,510
And what do you think I'm part of?

338
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,760
The Centre. It's everywhere.

339
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,220
What do you know about The Centre?

340
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,260
It's gonna kill everyone.
I was trying to get away from it.

341
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,050
How do you know alI this?

342
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,840
I just do. I can feel it.

343
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,260
I tried to get in on the Mars mission
but they wouldn't take me.

344
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,840
The Mars mission?

345
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,720
Yes. They're going to Mars.
It's safe there.

346
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,720
Who is going to Mars?
-The government.

347
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,760
They won't let us normaI people go.

348
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,090
Normal people.

349
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,550
Hello, Harry.

350
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:29,420
I've been very worried about you.

351
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,630
No! Don't let him near me.

352
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
Special Agent Faraday.

353
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,590
Harry used to be a helI of a scientist.

354
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,380
Did lots of classified stuff.

355
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:42,180
We can't leave him in a regular institution
because of what he might spilI.

356
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,090
You're referring to the Mars mission?

357
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,930
The what?
-He told me about a mission to Mars.

358
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:53,720
He's even farther gone than I thought.
If that's possible.

359
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,720
Now, come on, Harry.
-No, please don't let him take me.

360
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,840
Please, please.

361
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:08,630
Mr. Faraday, if there's anything else
I can do for you, please let me know.

362
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:10,800
Sure.

363
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:14,840
<i>We've been able to contact Mars.
Life on Mars.</i>

364
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:17,180
<i>We're going to Mars.</i>

365
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,630
See you around, Jones.

366
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:25,300
<i>It's all true.</i>

367
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,140
<i>Wilson's vigilante activities...</i>

368
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,670
<i>...kept the local white supremacists
at bay for years...</i>

369
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:35,800
<i>...but his luck ran out yesterday
when he was caught by a mob and killed.</i>

370
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,380
<i>Police say they have no suspects.</i>

371
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,260
<i>In other news- Hey.</i>

372
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,550
<i>Sorry to interrupt. There's something
I have to get off my chest.</i>

373
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,720
<i>I've always used my power
to help people...</i>

374
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,840
<i>...but the government's on my tail,
hunting me like a criminal.</i>

375
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:51,010
<i>You just saw what happened
to John Wilson.</i>

376
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,880
<i>America needs more people like him.</i>

377
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,720
<i>But where are they going to come from
if our government keeps acting this way?</i>

378
00:33:57,050 --> 00:34:01,140
<i>As for me, I'm quitting, giving it up.</i>

379
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:05,220
<i>Breaks my heart but there are people I love.
I don't want anything to happen to them.</i>

380
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:09,460
<i>So good night, everybody, and good luck.</i>

381
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,220
Who needed him anyway?
-Probably some kind of crook.

382
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,720
Definitely a freak.
-Definitely.

383
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,760
And what was with that red costume?
Red's for commies.

384
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,340
Hey, where are you going?
-Home.

385
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,460
Mr. Jones...

386
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,090
...how did you locate me?

387
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:05,550
I may not be the world's greatest
detective, but I have my methods.

388
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,460
This is alI the information
I've been able to collect.

389
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:09,760
It's the last of it.

390
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:15,380
I thought I could make a life for myself
here among you humans.

391
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,760
I didn't think I had a choice.

392
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,260
But there is one now.

393
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,300
There's just too much hatred here,
too much ignorance...

394
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:27,260
...too much mindless conformity.

395
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,300
I'm leaving.

396
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,630
Have a nice trip.

397
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,720
Some of us don't have that luxury.

398
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,380
Flying Cloud, status report.

399
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,840
Flying Cloud is go. Secure for launch.

400
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,260
Jordan?
-Go.

401
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,760
<i>Good luck, Flying Cloud.
God be with you.</i>

402
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,670
Go for launch on alI points.

403
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,140
<i>Roger, we are go for launch.</i>

404
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,880
Ignition sequence start.

405
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,930
<i>Primary engines engaged.</i>

406
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,510
<i>All engines running.</i>

407
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,880
Don't move, Martian.

408
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,970
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven...</i>

409
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:57,840
<i>...six, five...</i>

410
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,880
<i>...four, three, two, one.</i>

411
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,090
Almost there.

412
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,090
We're losing pressure.

413
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,260
We're gonna have to take her back.
-Too risky.

414
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,550
Jordan, listen to me.

415
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,140
We have weapons on board.
-What?

416
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:19,460
In case the Martians
turned out to be hostile.

417
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,930
Nerve gas, germ bombs, even nuclear.

418
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:27,970
Doesn't make a difference.
I can stilI land this thing.

419
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,510
What's that?
-It's a destruct switch.

420
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:34,590
I'm sorry, Jordan,
but you knew the risks.

421
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:39,010
You just relax, colonel.

422
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:41,180
I'll have you on the ground in no time.

423
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,670
<i>What's going on there?
Come in, Flying Cloud.</i>

424
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,510
<i>We've had an engine failure.
I'm gonna glide her back.</i>

425
00:38:46,670 --> 00:38:48,090
Negative, it's too dangerous.

426
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,720
<i>Where's Flagg?
-Don't worry about him...</i>

427
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,510
<i>...or your weapons. They'll both be okay.</i>

428
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,340
Weapons?

429
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,970
You son of a bitch.

430
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,260
Jordan, put Flagg back on.

431
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,420
No can do, Faraday. He's indisposed.

432
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,090
Call in the big guy.

433
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,010
Flagg, don't. I can land it.

434
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,800
I can't bet the world on that, Jordan.

435
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,300
Nuclear weapons?

436
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,260
Nerve gas? What were you thinking?

437
00:41:54,590 --> 00:41:57,180
We didn't know. We're still not sure.

438
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,460
Of what, exactly?

439
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,840
If we can trust him.

440
00:42:01,010 --> 00:42:03,630
You trust me and I'm an alien.
-Yeah, but...

441
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:06,550
It's because he looks
so different, isn't it?

442
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:09,720
You have to admit-
-Listen, you've seen the power he has.

443
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,930
He could leave this place
any time he wants.

444
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:13,630
But he hasn't.

445
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,220
That should telI you something.

446
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,800
Tell me about this America, Diana.

447
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,720
It's changed since the war.

448
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,010
Back then, we were in the right.
It was simple.

449
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:36,220
They still say they're in the right
but they don't act that way.

450
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,720
Men.

451
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:44,880
Things have changed here too, Diana.

452
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:48,760
A lot of us are beginning to think we need
a leader who sticks closer to home.

453
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:51,050
And who would such a leader be?

454
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:52,760
You?

455
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:02,800
You might need a little more seasoning.

456
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,260
Hal Jordan.

457
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:39,630
You know me?

458
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,260
Who are you?

459
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,840
I am...

460
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,300
...Abin Sur.

461
00:44:46,550 --> 00:44:49,050
You need a doctor. Let me-

462
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,550
Listen to me.

463
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:56,220
What I have to telI you
will seem unbelievable but-

464
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:04,010
I am the Green Lantern of Sector 2814.

465
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,800
I was on my way here to help.

466
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,880
Help? How?

467
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:13,720
In the coming battle with The Centre.

468
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,220
Center of what?

469
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,880
It is a monstrous creature
that fears you humans so much...

470
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:26,550
...it intends to eradicate every
living souI on the planet.

471
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:31,050
When I was entering your atmosphere
a few days ago...

472
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:34,220
...there was a huge explosion.

473
00:45:34,590 --> 00:45:37,800
There was too much yellow energy
for me.

474
00:45:37,970 --> 00:45:41,010
I ordered my ring to find you.

475
00:45:41,180 --> 00:45:44,260
I had to find a deserving one.

476
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,340
A man entirely without fear.

477
00:45:48,590 --> 00:45:53,420
A lot of people think I'm a coward
because of what happened in the war.

478
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,180
Did your ring telI you about that?

479
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,420
You are no coward, Hal Jordan.

480
00:45:58,670 --> 00:46:01,760
To you, all life is precious.

481
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:07,050
And this ring is far too powerful
to fall into the hands of someone...

482
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:09,300
...who doesn't understand that.

483
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:28,930
How does this thing work?

484
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,880
The Guardians...

485
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:35,630
They will...

486
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:52,140
Wow, you really do know him.

487
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:53,800
And you must be Robin.

488
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,010
I hear you're quite a detective.

489
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,460
WelI, I try not to brag, but-

490
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,300
Have you finished your homework yet?

491
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:02,970
Uh... Right.

492
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:09,090
Hm. New look, a sidekick.

493
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,010
Do you mind if I ask-?
-As a matter of fact, I do.

494
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:15,840
Let's just say I set out to scare criminals,
not children.

495
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:17,670
Fair enough.

496
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,180
This alI lines up with dozens of stories
we've run in the Planet this year.

497
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:25,630
The children's book
is particularly ominous.

498
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:28,460
As if someone, something else...

499
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:30,340
...were speaking through the author.

500
00:47:30,510 --> 00:47:33,930
<i>-in its wake. We have a live report
coming in from Cape Canaveral.</i>

501
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:37,550
<i>The creature is hovering over
the large fuel tanks here at the Cape...</i>

502
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:40,800
<i>...making it impossible for the Army
to use their missiles on it.</i>

503
00:47:40,970 --> 00:47:43,550
<i>Lois.
-Its wingspan is easily the length...</i>

504
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:44,880
<i>...of a football field...</i>

505
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:47,840
<i>...and it looks a lot like
a prehistoric pterodactyl.</i>

506
00:47:48,010 --> 00:47:49,970
<i>But much, much bigger.</i>

507
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,180
I'm not sure of what it's trying to do.

508
00:48:41,630 --> 00:48:43,380
Diana.

509
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:47,670
Haven't flown this thing in years.

510
00:48:48,090 --> 00:48:49,630
Guess I'm a little rusty.

511
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,220
Easy, easy.

512
00:48:51,670 --> 00:48:55,800
We fought it, hard as we could, but-

513
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,880
It's coming, KaI.

514
00:49:01,050 --> 00:49:03,420
It's coming here.

515
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:09,300
Medic!

516
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:12,970
We know this place could
never hold someone with your powers.

517
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,800
Why do you stay?
-I'm determined to beat you at this game.

518
00:49:16,970 --> 00:49:19,630
Without reading your mind.

519
00:49:19,970 --> 00:49:22,090
Come on, level with me.

520
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,510
Very well.

521
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:28,760
I have looked into your mind,
and by extension, your heart.

522
00:49:28,930 --> 00:49:31,630
You honestly believe
that there wilI be a better day...

523
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,630
...when all of this won't be necessary.

524
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:39,510
To find that within you, Mr. Faraday,
has filled my heart with hope.

525
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,140
And I have no place else to go.

526
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:51,550
This just came in from Washington,
urgent.

527
00:49:52,670 --> 00:49:54,340
It's The Centre, isn't it?

528
00:49:54,510 --> 00:49:57,300
I can feeI its presence very strongly now.

529
00:49:58,220 --> 00:49:59,970
You're looking for a place to go?

530
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,340
I got one helI of a destination for you.

531
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:03,800
But we might not come back.

532
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:05,760
I'm ready.

533
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,300
The last time I appeared
without warning in this form...

534
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:11,760
...someone died of fright.

535
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,840
Perhaps I should take a friendlier
appearance.

536
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,840
Suit yourself.

537
00:50:19,670 --> 00:50:21,380
WelI?

538
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,970
It's okay. But real men wear pants.

539
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:38,300
<i>-this absolutely unprecedented
situation off the coast of Florida.</i>

540
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:40,840
<i>The combined might
of the U.S. Armed Forces...</i>

541
00:50:41,010 --> 00:50:43,260
<i>...had no effect on this-
-Bourbon, please.</i>

542
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,180
<i>I hardly know what to call it.</i>

543
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:48,720
<i>It appears we've reestablished contact
with our reporter at the scene.</i>

544
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,800
<i>The only word I can find
to describe the scale of this is "biblical. "</i>

545
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:58,590
<i>It's a living island,
at least 25 miles across.</i>

546
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,180
<i>It has large ports which
discharge intense blasts of energy...</i>

547
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:09,420
<i>...but which can also draw things
into the creature.</i>

548
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:15,760
<i>Not two minutes ago, we watched it inhale
an entire aircraft carrier.</i>

549
00:51:19,050 --> 00:51:22,970
<i>The loss of life out here
is incalculable and-</i>

550
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:27,550
<i>Wait. We're turning around.
We've been ordered back.</i>

551
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,260
I have to tell you something.

552
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,510
I'm the F...
-I already know.

553
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,420
You what?

554
00:51:35,590 --> 00:51:37,260
I'm a reporter, remember?

555
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:40,670
I always suspected, and I heard your voice
on the news the other night.

556
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:45,090
I was only trying to protect you.
They think I'm some kind of criminal.

557
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,760
But we know better, don't we?

558
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,260
So, what are you waiting for?

559
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,180
You know who's going to be there?
Superman, Wonder Woman, people like that.

560
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:58,510
I'm just a guy who runs
after jewelry thieves and talking gorillas.

561
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,010
You're more than that.

562
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,340
And you're going to prove it.

563
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:21,300
What are you doing?

564
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:26,050
Where have you been?
And what happened to the simulator?

565
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:27,340
Long story.

566
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:30,180
Have you seen the news?
Do you have any idea what's-

567
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,510
Oh, God.

568
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:35,510
You're going down there, aren't you?

569
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,970
Hal the pacifist is going down there
to get killed by that thing.

570
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:40,550
What would you have me do?

571
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,340
Or do you think I'm a coward too?

572
00:52:42,510 --> 00:52:44,510
I looked up your war record.

573
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:47,010
You never fired
at those North Korean planes.

574
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:50,970
Maybe I just didn't believe that what
we were doing there was worth killing for.

575
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,510
But in that trench,
I found out what would make me kill.

576
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:58,800
Survival. I would kill to survive.

577
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:05,970
Aren't you going to at least say goodbye?

578
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,800
Don't you-?

579
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:30,300
Whoa. We're just here to help.

580
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:37,720
We don't need help.
Especially not from you.

581
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:41,550
You think you can hit me?
It's been tried before.

582
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,720
Don't push us, mister.

583
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:55,090
I see I have your attention.

584
00:53:55,510 --> 00:53:58,840
We face a threat big enough
to wipe us off the Earth...

585
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:02,840
...and still we bicker about a mask
or a uniform.

586
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:05,880
My best friend is lying upstairs right now.

587
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:08,420
She would have given her life
for this country...

588
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:12,380
...and I could hardly look her in the eye.
America was founded on the notion...

589
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,340
...that a person should be free
to follow his or her destiny.

590
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,720
But we can't do that if we're living in fear
of our own government.

591
00:54:19,010 --> 00:54:23,260
We need to reclaim this country
for free men and women everywhere.

592
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:26,550
What about your government friends?
-That's a fair question.

593
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:28,260
Superman's right.

594
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:30,460
The persecution and paranoia
have to stop.

595
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:34,970
From here on,
we work together as free Americans.

596
00:54:41,630 --> 00:54:44,720
I'm gonna fly out now
and recon this thing.

597
00:54:47,630 --> 00:54:50,590
When I get back,
we'Il work out a strategy.

598
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:51,800
Are you with me?

599
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:56,720
<i>America's champion, Superman...</i>

600
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,720
...went down in defeat severaI hours ago.

601
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:05,380
An exhaustive search
has found no sign of him.

602
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,930
Here at the Cape,
the greatest minds in the free world...

603
00:56:10,090 --> 00:56:14,510
...are now working on a plan to stop
this monster...

604
00:56:14,670 --> 00:56:16,880
...before it reaches the coast.

605
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:19,460
We cannot panic.

606
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:25,180
We cannot let our sense of loss-

607
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,550
If this book's right...

608
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,380
...it's a whole new life form
we've never even imagined.

609
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:43,930
Or it could be nothing more than
the ravings of some demented cartoonist.

610
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:49,260
It's not. I assure you.

611
00:56:49,420 --> 00:56:52,260
And there's only one way
to stop this thing now.

612
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:54,180
I want you all to listen to this man.

613
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:58,260
Gentlemen, I'm Ray Palmer
from Ivy University.

614
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:01,050
I've heard of you, Palmer,
and your invention.

615
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,420
Matter reduction, right?

616
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:04,930
Right. I...
-It won't work.

617
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:07,340
Everything it shrinks becomes unstable.

618
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:08,760
Exactly.

619
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,340
We start with an all-out aeriaI assault.

620
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:17,880
We hit the thing from every direction
at once. That's a distraction.

621
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,050
While it's fighting the Air Corps,
we use this baby on it.

622
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:24,800
This gizmo uses light to shrink things.

623
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:29,930
Question...
-Wait.

624
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:32,220
Everything the ray shrinks
becomes unstable.

625
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,300
Meaning, it explodes.

626
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,760
Still have a question?

627
00:57:38,930 --> 00:57:42,050
That thing out there is one
hell of a lot bigger than an orange.

628
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,050
How are you gonna?
-It is big.

629
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:47,550
And that's why we have to expose
its surface to the ray piece by piece.

630
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,340
All in the blink of an eye?
That's impossible without Superman.

631
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:55,550
No, it's not impossible, is it?

632
00:57:57,050 --> 00:57:58,140
Piece of cake.

633
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,800
Any other questions?

634
00:57:59,970 --> 00:58:01,510
Just one.
-Jordan.

635
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:04,220
About time.
-Attacking the surface won't be enough...

636
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:05,670
...to distract this thing.

637
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,720
You need someone
to go inside with bombs.

638
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:10,760
You volunteering?
-He'd better...

639
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:13,140
...because I'm not going in there alone.

640
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,300
Outstanding.

641
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,510
<i>All of you, remember...</i>

642
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:29,340
<i>...today there are no Democrats,
no Republicans.</i>

643
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,840
<i>No hawks, no doves.</i>

644
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,880
<i>Just the naked simplicity of an absolute:</i>

645
00:58:35,090 --> 00:58:37,300
<i>Mankind's survival.</i>

646
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:39,880
<i>Good luck to us all.</i>

647
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,550
All right, men.

648
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,180
Our job is to protect Flash until Morgan
and Jordan light it up.

649
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:17,720
I want...
-Hey, look out!

650
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:06,220
Hawk! Ah!

651
01:01:35,010 --> 01:01:40,380
Are you all right?
-It's attacking my mind.

652
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,930
All of you, fight on!

653
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,840
To the last breath, fight on!

654
01:02:39,010 --> 01:02:40,590
All weapons systems hot.

655
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,880
<i>Like they say, it ain't when you go,
it's how you go.</i>

656
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:20,220
Uh, Hal?
What's wrong?

657
01:03:20,380 --> 01:03:22,010
Whatever you see, ignore it.

658
01:03:22,180 --> 01:03:24,260
Just keep going. Acknowledge.

659
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:28,630
Just keep going. No problem.

660
01:03:37,670 --> 01:03:39,180
What now?

661
01:03:42,340 --> 01:03:45,670
This stuff is no hallucination,
-I'll tell you that.

662
01:03:51,420 --> 01:03:54,010
And whatever it is,
I think it's trying to get inside.

663
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,180
Drop the bombs,
then we'll burn our way out.

664
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:01,460
Roger that.

665
01:04:08,090 --> 01:04:09,340
My rockets are dead.

666
01:04:09,510 --> 01:04:10,840
Can't open bomb bay doors.

667
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:12,510
<i>Hal?
-I'm here.</i>

668
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:15,510
We've had our ride
and it's time to punch our ticket.

669
01:04:15,670 --> 01:04:17,670
<i>Initiate manual detonation.</i>

670
01:04:17,840 --> 01:04:19,720
Roger.

671
01:04:28,800 --> 01:04:31,590
<i>Hal Jordan, you are the key.</i>

672
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,970
<i>Your will drives the ring.</i>

673
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:38,800
<i>Clear your mind
and focus on what matters.</i>

674
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,220
Hal? What-?

675
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:29,880
Later.

676
01:05:33,420 --> 01:05:34,760
You're afraid.

677
01:05:34,930 --> 01:05:36,590
It's all on me.

678
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,140
The whole thing.

679
01:05:38,550 --> 01:05:40,510
We'll be there for you.

680
01:05:40,670 --> 01:05:42,630
We all will.

681
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,630
Godspeed.

682
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:41,590
He did it. Son of a bitch.

683
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,010
I was afraid...

684
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:56,840
...I'd be late for the victory party.

685
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:03,220
Spoke too soon.

686
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:18,590
That thing's gonna do a lot of damage.
Guess it's time to see what this ring can do.

687
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:19,800
Hey.

688
01:07:23,010 --> 01:07:24,460
Sorry.

689
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:36,380
That guy with the ring,
he wasn't part of the plan.

690
01:07:36,550 --> 01:07:37,840
Or wasn't I listening?

691
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,380
<i>You won't be able to do it.</i>

692
01:07:44,550 --> 01:07:47,720
<i>It is The Centre that holds, not you.</i>

693
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,930
I can. I can.

694
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,760
<i>You do not have the will.</i>

695
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:56,260
No?

696
01:07:56,420 --> 01:07:58,090
Watch.

697
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:41,630
Whoo-hoo!

698
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:54,140
Hey, Ace, what happened
to that buddy of yours?

699
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,420
Hal Jordan?

700
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:58,970
If I know him, he's up there somewhere
tear-assing around.

701
01:09:32,590 --> 01:09:34,760
I am Arthur of Atlantis.

702
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:38,840
This one has been asking
for a woman named Lois.

703
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,880
<i>The pioneers gave up their safety,
their comfort...</i>

704
01:10:09,050 --> 01:10:13,420
<i>...and sometimes their lives
to build our new West.</i>

705
01:10:13,590 --> 01:10:18,180
<i>They were determined
to make the new world strong and free...</i>

706
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:21,180
<i>...an example to the world.</i>

707
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:25,090
<i>Some would say that those struggles
are all over.</i>

708
01:10:25,260 --> 01:10:27,880
<i>That all the horizons have been explored.</i>

709
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:30,420
<i>That all the battles have been won.</i>

710
01:10:30,590 --> 01:10:34,140
<i>That there is no longer
an American frontier.</i>

711
01:10:36,090 --> 01:10:40,420
<i>And we stand today on the edge
of a new frontier.</i>

712
01:10:40,590 --> 01:10:45,010
<i>The frontier of unknown opportunities
and perils.</i>

713
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:51,010
<i>Beyond that frontier are uncharted areas
of science and space.</i>

714
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,010
<i>Unsolved problems of peace and war.</i>

715
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:58,930
<i>Unconquered pockets
of ignorance and prejudice.</i>

716
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,300
<i>I'm asking each of you...</i>

717
01:11:02,460 --> 01:11:05,930
<i>...to be pioneers
towards that new frontier.</i>

718
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:10,510
<i>My call is to the young at heart,
regardless of age.</i>

719
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:13,260
<i>Can we carry through in an age...</i>

720
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:17,880
<i>...where we will witness not only new
breakthroughs in weapons of destruction...</i>

721
01:11:18,050 --> 01:11:21,380
<i>...but also a race for mastery
of the sky and the rain...</i>

722
01:11:21,550 --> 01:11:25,300
<i>...the ocean and the tides,
the far side of space...</i>

723
01:11:25,460 --> 01:11:28,300
<i>...and the inside of men's minds?</i>

724
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:32,140
<i>All mankind waits upon our decision.</i>

725
01:11:32,300 --> 01:11:36,970
<i>A whole world looks to see
what we shall do.</i>

726
01:11:37,460 --> 01:11:42,970
<i>And we cannot fail their trust.
And we cannot fail to try.</i>
