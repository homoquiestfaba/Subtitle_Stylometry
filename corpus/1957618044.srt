- Yo, what up, Mr. J?

23
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,373
- [Female] Who is it, honey?

24
00:01:25,373 --> 00:01:27,130
- It's just Alphonso.

25
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,620
- Just Alphonso?

26
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:29,641
That's cold.

27
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:30,474
- Hey Alphonso.

28
00:01:30,474 --> 00:01:31,307
- How you doing, Mrs. J?

29
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,373
- So?

30
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,970
- So, Mr. J, Ella and I
are going to the movies.

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,470
- Ella, Alphonso's here.

32
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:40,000
- Uncle Buddy, come on,
we're gonna be late.

33
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,460
Mom, I finished the dishes.

34
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,120
- Please put a jacket on
over that skimpy dress.

35
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,953
- Amen.

36
00:01:44,953 --> 00:01:45,786
- Okay.

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,150
- What are you looking at?

38
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,184
- You've got a piece of
spinach between your teeth.

39
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:53,200
- I do?

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,033
- Psyche!

41
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,719
- Bye, mister and miss J.

42
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:57,719
You're dead!

43
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,750
- Anybody see a streak
of greased lightning

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,710
run through here?

45
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,600
Might've resembled a girl in pigtails.

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,550
- We did.

47
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,634
And thanks.

48
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:06,467
- Okay.

49
00:02:11,164 --> 00:02:13,747
(upbeat music)

50
00:02:17,977 --> 00:02:19,241
- Hey.

51
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:20,074
- Your seat, madam.

52
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:20,911
Would you like something to drink?

53
00:02:20,911 --> 00:02:23,071
Some (mumbling)?

54
00:02:23,071 --> 00:02:24,793
- Oh Hubie.

55
00:02:24,793 --> 00:02:26,047
- It's hors d'oeuvres, Hubie.

56
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:28,430
(laughing)

57
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,428
- Yo Hubie.

58
00:02:29,428 --> 00:02:31,465
You gotta see this flick, man.

59
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:32,298
- What flick is that, Phonso?

60
00:02:32,298 --> 00:02:34,750
- Cowboys ride the
plains in the wild west.

61
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,580
- Yeah, they should make
more movies like that

62
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,470
only with black cowboys.

63
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,409
- Well you know, I saw Danny Glover

64
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,242
play a cowboy once.

65
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,129
He was bad.

66
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,153
- Uncle Buddy, why don't they
make more movies like that?

67
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:47,160
- Well, maybe someday somebody will.

68
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,380
Maybe even somebody I'm
talking to at this very moment.

69
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,840
- Yeah, I could see it now.

70
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,890
Ella Jackson presents an Ella Jackson film

71
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,370
written, produced, and
directed by Ella Jackson.

72
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:00,190
- I'll be the first in
line to buy tickets.

73
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,810
- Check this out, Mr. J.

74
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:05,230
If I made a movie about
buffalo soldiers and Indians,

75
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,343
I'll call it Boys In The Reservation.

76
00:03:08,343 --> 00:03:09,250
(laughing)

77
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,330
- If you ever make a movie,

78
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,580
I hope you let someone
else choose the title.

79
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,117
- What do you say, Buddy?

80
00:03:18,117 --> 00:03:19,741
- I'm fine, Janet, you?

81
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,517
- You're in good company tonight.

82
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:23,754
- Not too shabby, not too shabby.

83
00:03:23,754 --> 00:03:25,800
- You gonna win that championship, Ella?

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,420
- You know that.

85
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,870
- That's what I like to hear.

86
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,030
So what are you having?

87
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,837
- Why don't we get some

88
00:03:33,837 --> 00:03:36,056
of your famous peach cobbler a la mode?

89
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:37,589
- And I'll have one too.

90
00:03:37,589 --> 00:03:38,818
- All right.

91
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:40,152
- I don't want anything.

92
00:03:40,152 --> 00:03:41,218
- What?

93
00:03:41,218 --> 00:03:42,292
- I'm not hungry.

94
00:03:42,292 --> 00:03:44,813
- You're a teenage boy,
you're always hungry.

95
00:03:44,813 --> 00:03:45,933
That's what you do best, eat.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,290
- Make his a double
peach cobbler a la mode.

97
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,440
- Yeah.

98
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,160
- Mr. J, you always doing stuff for me

99
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,271
and I never get a chance
to do anything for you.

100
00:03:55,271 --> 00:03:56,810
- Well, friends can do things for friends

101
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,570
without expecting payback.

102
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:00,450
- But you bought a popcorn at the movies

103
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:02,170
and the snacks after the movies.

104
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,793
When do I get to be your friend?

105
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,870
- Every time we hang out together.

106
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,510
If you weren't my
friend, would we hang out

107
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,403
so much together?

108
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,583
- Well, no.

109
00:04:12,559 --> 00:04:13,520
- I rest my case.

110
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,580
But if you really wanna do
something special for me--

111
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,500
- Name it, Mr. J, just name it.

112
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,410
- Take Hubie's advice, let someone else

113
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,399
choose the titles of your films.

114
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,649
(laughing)

115
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:31,320
- Come on, teamwork.

116
00:04:35,789 --> 00:04:37,469
Pass the ball, Ella.

117
00:04:37,469 --> 00:04:40,219
(crowd cheering)

118
00:04:42,055 --> 00:04:44,325
- Face baby dance.

119
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,223
- Face baby dance, is that
one of those authentic

120
00:04:47,223 --> 00:04:48,806
basketball sayings.

121
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,313
- Ella, pass it.

122
00:05:09,313 --> 00:05:11,429
Over here, pass it, Ella.

123
00:05:11,429 --> 00:05:12,346
Ella, Ella.

124
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,347
Pass the ball.

125
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:18,299
(crowd cheering)

126
00:05:20,424 --> 00:05:21,569
- I was open.

127
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,409
- Move, Cindy, I didn't see you, okay.

128
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:25,067
- Yeah, right.

129
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,817
(crowd cheering)

130
00:06:13,051 --> 00:06:13,923
- That was a real close game.

131
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,783
Very close, but we won.

132
00:06:18,783 --> 00:06:21,033
(applause)

133
00:06:22,109 --> 00:06:24,259
If we want that championship,
we're gonna have to do it

134
00:06:24,259 --> 00:06:26,210
one more time, two weeks from today.

135
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:28,480
So, what are we gonna
do while we're waiting.

136
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,700
We gotta practice hard.

137
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,533
- [Team] Yes.

138
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,283
- You're gotta (indistinct) hard.

139
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,430
- [Team] Yes.

140
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,569
- Do you want this championship?

141
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:36,760
- [Team] Yes.

142
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,393
- I can't hear you, do
you want the championship?

143
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:40,413
- [Team] Yes,

144
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:41,988
- All right, see you in practice.

145
00:06:41,988 --> 00:06:44,010
There will be no excuses, Tamara.

146
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,890
- Oh, coach,

147
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:48,003
I really did have to get
my braces tightened, see.

148
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,655
- Close your mouth girl, the
reflection is killing me.

149
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:52,999
(laughter)

150
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:53,840
- [Coach] All right, see
you guys in practice.

151
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,900
Ella, great game, great game.

152
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,310
27 points and every one of them counts.

153
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,920
- Thanks coach.

154
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,830
- Great shot at being the
summer league top scorer.

155
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,013
- Yeah, now that the
blazers are out of it,

156
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:06,750
Miller can't score any more points.

157
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,260
- But Ella, that's not
our primary objective.

158
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,220
We want the team to be summer champs.

159
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,990
This is a team, Ella.

160
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:14,050
- But coach...

161
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:17,543
- No buts, we live or die as a team, okay.

162
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,363
- Yes, coach.

163
00:07:21,878 --> 00:07:23,650
- Ella, Ella.

164
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,410
- Daddy, daddy.

165
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,580
- 27 points closer to
that score and trophy.

166
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,295
- 27 points closer to the summer
league special scholarship.

167
00:07:31,295 --> 00:07:32,295
- All right.

168
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,360
Another 19 points and
you are the summer league

169
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,600
scoring champion.

170
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,850
I thought you should name this girl Magic.

171
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,130
- Magic Jackson, I like that.

172
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,080
I gotta go tell uncle Buddy.

173
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,913
Bye.

174
00:07:41,913 --> 00:07:42,982
- Ella.

175
00:07:42,982 --> 00:07:43,815
- Yeah, mom.

176
00:07:43,815 --> 00:07:45,368
Thanks, bye.

177
00:07:45,368 --> 00:07:47,050
- I need to hit the books.

178
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,040
Wow, it is late.

179
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:50,770
- Well, why don't I make dinner.

180
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:52,410
- I really would appreciate that.

181
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:53,243
- Yeah?

182
00:07:53,243 --> 00:07:54,214
How much?

183
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:55,047
- A lot.

184
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,690
- Mister and Mrs. Jackson,
just turn the lights out

185
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,827
when you leave.

186
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,510
- Oh, oh, oh, oh,

187
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,210
that Alphonso is so cute.

188
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,470
- Tara, now I know what's
wrong with your game.

189
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,570
- What's that?

190
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,860
- You're blind.

191
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,403
- Hi Ella, great game.

192
00:08:17,403 --> 00:08:18,770
- Thanks.

193
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:19,603
- Hi, Alphonso.

194
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,580
- There she is, Ella, the gun Jackson.

195
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,013
The girl who never met
a shot she didn't take.

196
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,100
- Alphonso, what is it?

197
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:34,860
- I wanna know one thing, which is bigger.

198
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,733
The basketball or your head.

199
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,930
Your head wins again.

200
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,270
- The biggest thing
around here is your mouth.

201
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:44,000
- So, I bet you go on to uncle Buddy

202
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,360
to brag about them 27 point, huh.

203
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,760
- Well, he's not your uncle.

204
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,530
- Well, he's not your uncle either,

205
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,710
he's your daddy's uncle.

206
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,543
So there.

207
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,380
- I'm not gonna hit you.

208
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,840
- Yeah, right.

209
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,770
- Really, I promise.

210
00:08:57,770 --> 00:08:59,308
- You swear?

211
00:08:59,308 --> 00:09:00,141
- I swear.

212
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,880
In the words of the terminator

213
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,980
asta la vista, sucker.

214
00:09:06,889 --> 00:09:08,320
- It's asta la vista baby.

215
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,837
And give me back my bag
before I terminate you.

216
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,616
- Truce, truce, for real.

217
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,200
Thanks.

218
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,793
Still got a big head though.

225
00:09:50,251 --> 00:09:51,084
- Hi, uncle buddy.

226
00:09:51,084 --> 00:09:52,960
- I hate it when you do that movie stuff.

227
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,628
That's 'cause you can't do it.

228
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,470
- How are you doing, Alphonso.

229
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,760
- Yo, Mr. J, you know me.

230
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,147
Just trying to do the right thing.

231
00:09:59,147 --> 00:10:02,473
- Doing the right thing,
that's fresh out there.

232
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,054
- Somebody's been watching
too much yo MTV raps.

233
00:10:09,054 --> 00:10:10,680
(laughter)

234
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,030
- Ella, I can't take the
suspense, did you win?

235
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,963
- Yeah.

236
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,710
- Bad game?

237
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:21,720
- Yeah, I scored 27 points.

238
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,540
- Oh, you little devil you.

239
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,760
This girl's gonna win a
trophy for best shooter

240
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,693
and an Oscar for being a faker.

241
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,830
- Yo, Mr. J, speaking of Oscars,

242
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,670
we all gonna go to movie tonight?

243
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,002
- Yeah, uncle Buddy.

244
00:10:34,002 --> 00:10:36,690
- We've already seen all the new releases.

245
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:40,010
- But we haven't seen 'I
dismember momma' part two.

246
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:44,000
No one's allowed under 17
without a parent or guardian.

247
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,320
And a barf bag.

248
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,420
(laughter)

249
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,460
- No, I don't think so.

250
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,117
- I can do with that.

251
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:52,590
- 'Cause I just remembered,
down at the Baldwin

252
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:53,950
they're showing some oldies.

253
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,810
And tonight they got a real goodie.

254
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,603
'Back in the preacher' a western.

255
00:10:58,482 --> 00:10:59,707
- Oh, can't miss that one.

256
00:10:59,707 --> 00:11:01,120
You know how he loves them shoot them ups.

257
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,633
- No, but this isn't just any western,

258
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:04,320
this is a black western.

259
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,270
- Yeah, like the stories you
used to tell Alphonso and me.

260
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,320
About the Criole Kid, the top 10 Texas,

261
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,127
the team tombstone, the toughest hombre,

262
00:11:13,127 --> 00:11:14,056
west of the Pekos.

263
00:11:14,056 --> 00:11:14,889
- North of Rio Grand.

264
00:11:14,889 --> 00:11:16,170
- South of little big horn.

265
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,003
- The East of, East of...

266
00:11:17,003 --> 00:11:18,131
- East of death valley.

267
00:11:18,131 --> 00:11:18,964
- Yeah.

268
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,310
- Well, this western is really special.

269
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:24,030
And Sydney Pwadyer directed it.

270
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,930
- That means he's in charge.

271
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:26,763
- Yes, he was in charge.

272
00:11:26,763 --> 00:11:28,930
But he's also acting, right alongside

273
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:31,810
Harry Belofonte and he was just brilliant.

274
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,036
He plays this cavalry soldier.

275
00:11:34,036 --> 00:11:35,908
- No, don't tell, uncle Buddy, don't tell.

276
00:11:35,908 --> 00:11:37,600
- All right, all right.

277
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,280
Just remember who told
you it was brilliant.

278
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,530
- Buddy, excuse me, I
just wanna know one thing.

279
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:45,120
Who died and left you cisco and ebrich.

280
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:49,230
- Yo, Mr. J, we're on.

281
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,930
I'll see you two after dinner.

282
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,990
I gotta go home, so I'm
gone with the breeze.

283
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,630
- It's wind, I'm gone with the wind.

284
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:59,350
- I knew that, I was just testing you

285
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,610
to see if you were still on your toes.

286
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,433
Now, I'm finna fade out of here.

287
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,997
Fade out of here, that
was a good one, wasn't it.

288
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,480
- Okay, there you go, Thaddeus.

289
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,180
- It's about time.

290
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,820
- Listen, I did a little something special

291
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,000
for you here in the back.

292
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,490
I saw it on Yo MTV rap.

293
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,596
I shaved in your initial, a big T.

294
00:12:24,596 --> 00:12:26,846
(laughter)

295
00:12:28,554 --> 00:12:29,387
- Oh, man.

296
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:39,783
- Well?

297
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:41,723
- Well, what?

298
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,420
- A man slays over a
hot stove to make dinner

299
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,920
for his family and this
is all the thanks he gets.

300
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,240
- Daddy, this chicken's great.

301
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,650
- Yeah, these dumplings make
me proud to call you nephew.

302
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,590
- Everybody thinks the
only reason I married you

303
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,580
is 'cause you're so good looking.

304
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,910
- Yeah, well, when you
get that law degree,

305
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:02,250
I may just quit my job,
stay home and just cook

306
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,870
plenty of this little good home cooking

307
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,230
so you can keep your strength up.

308
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:07,170
Go out there, make that big money.

309
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:10,140
- What if I decide to become
a public interest lawyer.

310
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:12,100
They hardly make any money.

311
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,740
- In that case, I'll keep
my job and we'll start

312
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,960
clipping those coupons for the Kernel.

313
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:16,793
- Don't worry, Daddy.

314
00:13:16,793 --> 00:13:19,220
When I become the first woman in the NBA,

315
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,950
I'm gonna take care of everybody.

316
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,940
- Uncle Buddy, you should
have seen her today.

317
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,063
- Yeah, uncle Buddy, that ball had eyes.

318
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,410
- That's my girl.

319
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,313
- She was great.

320
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,570
That's why I was wondering,
what was going on

321
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:36,770
between you and coach
Dawson after the game?

322
00:13:37,863 --> 00:13:39,100
- That was no big thing.

323
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,480
- I was concerned, you looked upset.

324
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,920
- Honey, what are you talking about?

325
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,040
- I thought I heard
coach Dawson say the team

326
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,930
lives or dies as a team.

327
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:49,580
- Yeah, well, she should
have said the team

328
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,720
lives or dies by your jump shot.

329
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,910
Thank you very much.

330
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,480
- Honey, do you think she
was being critical of you?

331
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,240
- Mom, she wasn't being critical

332
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,710
and why would you bring it up?

333
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,000
- It seemed to me she wanted to help you.

334
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,730
- If coach Dawson wants to help,

335
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:03,720
she can start by recognizing pure genius

336
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,630
when is right in her face.

337
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,640
No, wait a minute, is it helpful to give

338
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:09,370
the top shooter the blues
for being the top shooter.

339
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,570
How is that helping.

340
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,620
Seems to me she stopped being so helpful.

341
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:16,503
- Can I go to my room, I'm really tired.

342
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,977
- Of course you are.

343
00:14:18,977 --> 00:14:21,810
- All right, but you still
have to clear the table

344
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:23,670
and wash the dishes.

345
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,503
- Fine.

346
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:31,520
- Maybe I'm the one who should
stop trying to be so helpful.

347
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,610
- It's not you, it's that silly coach,

348
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,140
that's who upset her.

349
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:34,973
- Excuse me.

350
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,660
(knocks on the door)

351
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,100
- Who is it?

352
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,923
- I want to be alone.

353
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,283
- Uncle Buddy.

354
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:54,160
- Uncle Buddy, I'm supposed
to be (distorted sound)

355
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,690
I thought you could use some company.

356
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,523
- Thanks.

357
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,693
- I wish I could have seen that game.

358
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,430
- You would have bee
there if you could have.

359
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:11,030
You always are.

360
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,330
Besides, I felt you cheering me

361
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,167
all the way from the barber shop.

362
00:15:15,167 --> 00:15:16,417
- I was, I was.

363
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,803
It's great to know you understand.

364
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:30,230
You know, I've always
liked that Magic Johnson.

365
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:37,140
Got that smile, like being
a star was the easiest thing

366
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:39,243
in the world.

367
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,223
You know better

368
00:15:47,730 --> 00:15:49,590
- I guess I'm not Magic Jackson after all.

369
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,753
- Yes, you are.

370
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,780
But magic is just one part of it.

371
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:57,403
Hard work, teamwork.

372
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,407
That's the other part.

373
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:00,840
- But what am I supposed to do.

374
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:04,010
Why shouldn't I take the
shot if I know I can make it.

375
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,040
- Ella.

376
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,030
- Okay, I know that being a
hotdog isn't a good thing,

377
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,670
but how do I know when it's the right time

378
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:12,303
to pass off or when it's
the right time to shoot?

379
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,500
- Ella, you've got a good heart,

380
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,420
you want to do the right thing.

381
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:20,413
I trust you to find your own way.

382
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,710
- Suppose I don't.

383
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:24,573
- You will.

384
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:30,080
- You think I could
find my way and still be

385
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,627
summer league scoring champ?

386
00:16:31,627 --> 00:16:33,473
(laughter)

387
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:36,390
(foreign language)

388
00:16:40,014 --> 00:16:40,847
- Alphonso, you wanna die?

389
00:16:40,847 --> 00:16:44,070
- The shot was all false, just
try to knock it in for you.

390
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,420
What are you looking for?

391
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,640
- I found your little pea brain.

392
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,940
Let me knock that in for you.

393
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,886
- Best be prepared to (indistinct)

394
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,610
- Excuse me.

395
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,814
Excuse me, is there Buddy
Jackson at this address?

396
00:16:54,814 --> 00:16:56,090
- Yeah.

397
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:57,393
- Don't bump the walls.

398
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,433
Put it over here.

399
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:04,160
- Say bye I heard some
white wild (indistinct)

400
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,530
- Thank you.

401
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,971
- Sign it right here, please.

402
00:17:06,971 --> 00:17:07,804
- Absolutely.

403
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,693
- Who did this thing come from
Indiana Jones or something.

404
00:17:10,693 --> 00:17:11,526
- Thanks.

405
00:17:11,526 --> 00:17:12,587
- Mom, it's from Ella Du Champ.

406
00:17:12,587 --> 00:17:14,590
- Ella Du Champs.

407
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,904
- What if it's from the Ellen Du Champs.

408
00:17:16,904 --> 00:17:18,100
- That really would be exciting,

409
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,840
but it probably isn't from her.

410
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,220
- Why not?

411
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,620
- Honey don't you think uncle Buddy

412
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,781
would have mentioned
knowing the Ella Du Champs.

413
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:28,460
- Hmm, mom you're gonna
make a great lawyer.

414
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:31,770
- Yo excuse me but who
is the Ella Du Champs.

415
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,050
- He doesn't know anything.

416
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,680
It's so pathetic.

417
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,100
- Ella Du Champs was a
famous black movie actress

418
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,943
in the 40s.

419
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,560
Ella.

420
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,010
- Oh it's just a paper mom.

421
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,530
Uncle Buddy said she's the most
beautiful woman in the world

422
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,600
and I was named after her.

423
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,860
Actually you were named
after Ella Du Champs

424
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,590
and Ella Fitzgerald.

425
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:54,690
See uncle buddy was a
big fan of Ella Du Champs

426
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:57,670
and your dad was a big
fan of Ella Fitzgerald

427
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,670
and we had this beautiful baby
girl with a big set of pipes.

428
00:18:03,369 --> 00:18:06,970
Alphonso I tell you when
this girl started wailing,

429
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:10,320
we thought she was gonna break
every glass in the house.

430
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,090
- Well, this girl is still loud.

431
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:15,530
but I guess she was much
better looking as a baby huh.

432
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:17,870
- Ha-ha-ha, that's so funny.

433
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,170
- Ella what are you doing?

434
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,293
- Oh I was just making a face at Alphonso.

435
00:18:23,949 --> 00:18:25,620
- What are you doing with your hands.

436
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:28,480
- Oh with my hands I just wanted to see

437
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,720
what was in the trunk, you know.

438
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,940
I wanted to make sure that it wasn't

439
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,570
from the Ella Du Champs.

440
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,650
- Do you see the name
Ella Jackson anywhere.

441
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,060
- Uh-oh, somebody got snack.

442
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,470
- But mom, uncle Buddy won't mind.

443
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:40,500
- I mind.

444
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,623
- Oh please.

445
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,030
Okay, okay I'll leave it alone.

446
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:50,280
Come on Alphonso, let's
go and shoot some jumpers.

447
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,720
- You never give up this easy.

448
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,510
- Who said anything about giving up.

449
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,700
Uncle buddy will let me open it.

450
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,533
Come on.

451
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,523
- That's nice.

452
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,860
- Thank you very much, sir.

453
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,980
You have a good day.

454
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,813
- Thanks.

455
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,610
- Thaddeus, if you're still alive,

456
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:18,323
could you signal by moving
one of your checkers.

457
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:30,500
Can I give you a hint, this
is not brain surgery man,

458
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,603
it's checkers, move.

459
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,550
- You heard that old
saying, you study long

460
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,913
you study wrong.

461
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,130
- There's no point in rushing, Thaddeus.

462
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:45,350
The more you rushing, the slower he goes.

463
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:48,510
- But I believe that ice
moved faster than him.

464
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,810
- Couldn't move no slower.

465
00:19:52,172 --> 00:19:53,255
- Hallelujah.

466
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:56,850
- Guess what uncle Buddy,
you just got a trunk.

467
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,313
- I do, where.

468
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,243
- Good one, Mr. J

469
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:01,076
- Uncle Buddy, come on.

470
00:20:01,076 --> 00:20:02,210
It just got delivered to the house

471
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,370
and I told mom that you'd say
it's okay for me to open it,

472
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,260
but she's in one of those
everything by the book moon.

473
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,320
So I need for you to say it's okay, okay.

474
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,833
- Slow down, I got a trunk?

475
00:20:11,917 --> 00:20:12,857
From who?

476
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:14,270
- I can't believe I forgot the best part,

477
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,047
is from Ella Du Champs.

478
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,800
- [Man] Aint there an
actress by that name.

479
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,450
- You really must be getting old

480
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,200
to forget a woman like that.

481
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,890
They used to call her
the colored Vivian Lee.

482
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,070
But for my money, if they'd ever been

483
00:20:27,070 --> 00:20:29,490
in the picture together, by the end of it,

484
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,080
people would have been saying Vivian who.

485
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
- Well what's Buddy doing,
getting a trunk from an actress?

486
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,810
- Well we're not sure
that it's from her yet,

487
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,340
but I can't wait to find out.

488
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,173
- Come on.

489
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:41,006
- No.

490
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,290
- What?

491
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:46,630
- I don't have to explain
myself to you, young lady.

492
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,180
- And then Ella said he
just went off on everybody.

493
00:20:50,134 --> 00:20:51,320
- You know how Ella exaggerates.

494
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,090
It doesn't sound like uncle Buddy.

495
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,790
- And taking no for an answer
doesn't sound like Ella.

496
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,373
I wonder why he doesn't want it opened.

497
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,350
Maybe it is from Ella Du
Champs and maybe uncle Buddy

498
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,630
was the hairdresser on one of her movies

499
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,130
and they had this mad
passionate love affair

500
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:14,150
and then she dropped
him and broke his heart.

501
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,230
- If she broke his heart,
how come he wanted us

502
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,817
to name our daughter after her.

503
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:21,390
- You know, you can be very annoying

504
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:22,633
when you're being logical.

505
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,403
- Thank you.

506
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:29,847
(soft music)

507
00:22:06,297 --> 00:22:07,340
- Hopefully he will have calmed down

508
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,650
by the time he gets home

509
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:11,763
because I am dying to ask him about her.

510
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:14,850
Oh hi uncle Buddy.

511
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:15,920
- Linda.

512
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,690
Uh Joe, I can't lift that trunk.

513
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,750
Could you get rid of it for me.

514
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,943
- Without opening it?

515
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:23,620
- Yes, without opening it.

516
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:26,290
- Well, aren't you curious
about what's in it?

517
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,730
- No I'm not and I don't
wanna be cross-examined

518
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,810
about it either.

519
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:32,623
Joe just get rid of the trunk, okay.

520
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:36,423
Can a man get any
privacy in his own house.

521
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:39,218
- Uh, uncle buddy, we're gonna have dinner

522
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,460
soon as Ella gets home from the library.

523
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,110
- I won't be eating this evening.

524
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,530
- I don't know what he's so upset about.

525
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,760
If I got a trunk from Denzel Washington,

526
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,880
I wouldn't be going
around telling everyone

527
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,780
not to cross-examine me in my own house.

528
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,750
- Why would you get a trunk
from Denzel Washington.

529
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,003
- None of your business.

530
00:23:28,883 --> 00:23:30,050
- Uncle Buddy.

531
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,018
- Come in.

532
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:46,082
- I heard the music, are you okay.

533
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,643
- Just feeling a little blue.

534
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,759
- No, Uncle Buddy, you
don't have the blues.

535
00:23:58,759 --> 00:24:01,537
- Everybody can have the
blues every now and then.

536
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:03,723
- But that means you're
sad or you're hurt.

537
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:07,570
- No, I just think I'm a little tired,

538
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:09,653
been overworking.

539
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:18,633
I'm not as young as I used to be.

540
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,640
- Could I read to you?

541
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,523
You always read to me when I'm tired.

542
00:24:30,912 --> 00:24:33,334
- That's mighty kind of you, Ella,

543
00:24:33,334 --> 00:24:36,383
but I think I just wanna
let my brain go empty.

544
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,050
- I could help you beat the blues.

545
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,603
- No, thank you for caring.

546
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:50,350
I'll see you in the morning.

547
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,380
Probably by then, blues
will be all washed away.

548
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:05,419
- Okay, good night then.

549
00:25:05,901 --> 00:25:06,901
- Night too.

550
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,240
- Okay ladies, I want you to take a second

551
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,570
and look around.

552
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,253
Go ahead look.

553
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:35,650
Seems the same, doesn't it.

554
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,743
Same old faces in the same old
gym with the same old coach.

555
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,360
Well it's not.

556
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,410
This is the first time that
we've all been together

557
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:50,040
in this gym to practice for
the league championship.

558
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,970
This is all new.

559
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,990
Are we excited about this?

560
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,970
- [Team] Yes.

561
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,360
- Are we excited about this?

562
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,193
- [Team] Yes.

563
00:25:58,193 --> 00:25:59,621
- All right.

564
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:02,288
(whistle blows)

565
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,373
Hey.

566
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,203
Great.

567
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,663
Real good.

568
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,350
Cindy, that pass was right to you.

569
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:25,910
- I'm sorry coach, I was in shock.

570
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,220
- 30 laps.

571
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,912
- You play like you're in shock.

572
00:26:28,912 --> 00:26:30,460
- Ella, get back in line.

573
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,913
Hey, 50 laps.

574
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:35,643
All right.

575
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,313
Oh.

576
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,523
- Uncle Buddy.

577
00:27:30,678 --> 00:27:33,095
(slow music)

578
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,690
- [Voice Over] My dear Buddy,
if you are reading this

579
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,350
then I am gone.

580
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,910
Don't think of me as old and sick,

581
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:49,590
remember me the way we
were when we were young

582
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,320
and full of dreams.

583
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,690
I leave you my treasure, what
remains of all that we were,

584
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:57,260
all that you were.

585
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,840
May it finally mean as much to you

586
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,270
as it has always meant to me.

587
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:04,193
Love, Ella.

588
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,193
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

589
00:28:11,193 --> 00:28:13,470
You mean to tell me that
you went into Mr. J's room,

590
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,247
took out his letter and then read it.

591
00:28:15,247 --> 00:28:18,460
I don't believe this, I
really don't believe this.

592
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,660
What'd it say?

593
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,453
- It said something about
her leaving him a treasure.

594
00:28:24,861 --> 00:28:25,694
- A treasure.

595
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,473
We rich, we rich.

596
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,145
Okay you gonna be rich,
I'm not gonna be rich.

597
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:34,000
All right, you're gonna be rich.

598
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,090
- Alphonso, I don't want
you to strain yourself here,

599
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,070
but try and think if it
was that kind of treasure,

600
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,170
why would uncle Buddy wanna get rid of it.

601
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:42,710
- Well maybe uncle Buddy
don't know what's in there.

602
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,900
- If he doesn't know what's in there,

603
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,323
why is he so upset?

604
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,520
- Is there smoke coming out my ears yet?

605
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,140
- Alphonso, we've got to open that trunk.

606
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,280
- Okay look, now what I want you to do

607
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,310
is when you get to your spot,

608
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,120
I want you to fake your opponent
like you're going around,

609
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,203
pull back, go up and angle your shot.

610
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,333
Okay, now your turn.

611
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,790
Now, remember you gotta
get your arc on the shot.

612
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,090
That's what makes it good.

613
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:08,123
Fake, shoot.

614
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,920
Ella if we're gonna win
this scoring trophy,

615
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:15,100
you're gonna have to get
more fade in that fadeaway.

616
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,950
Now get the ball.

617
00:29:18,835 --> 00:29:19,918
- Ella, Ella.

618
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,833
- Ms. Space cadet, let's go.

619
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:56,773
- Ella girl, you need to
get a grip on yourself.

620
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,660
- [Man On TV] She's chosen
curtain number three.

621
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:13,576
Lana, show our viewers what's
behind curtain number three.

622
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:16,659
(instrumental music)

623
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,750
- Alphonso, you gotta
come over, right away.

624
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,583
Okay.

625
00:30:32,391 --> 00:30:34,656
(laughter)

626
00:30:34,656 --> 00:30:36,810
- It's a snake.

627
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:37,970
- I think it's dead.

628
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:38,803
- I knew that.

629
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:43,280
- Wow, what is all this stuff.

630
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,733
- What kind of treasure
is this supposed to be.

631
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,520
Just a bunch of old BT stuff.

632
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,703
- BT stuff.

633
00:30:55,703 --> 00:30:59,213
- Yeah BT, you know
like before television.

634
00:30:59,213 --> 00:31:00,046
Action.

635
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,570
- Alphonso, this must be
from the Ella Du Champs.

636
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,960
- How do you know that?

637
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,660
- This is a film can.

638
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,223
Who else would have a
trunk full of film cans.

639
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,660
- Wait, it's the movie
about the creole can.

640
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:18,093
- The creole can, but I
thought he made that up.

641
00:31:18,093 --> 00:31:23,093
- I don't get it.

642
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:26,948
Make my day.

643
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
- Alphonso, I think this is uncle Buddy.

644
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:37,710
- It is uncle Buddy, with a serious babe.

645
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:40,370
- Check this out.

646
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,670
Wow it's just like the same
one that woman's wearing

647
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:43,673
in the picture.

648
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:49,799
Wow.

649
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:53,411
(laughter)

650
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,930
It's Mr J and the Duke, the Duke.

651
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:09,320
- That's John Wayne.

652
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,173
- Mr. J used to be in the movies.

653
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:17,127
- No Alphonso, he made
movies with Ella Du Champs.

654
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,730
Uncle buddy was W.B Jackson.

655
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,513
Uncle Buddy was a director.

656
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:26,350
- Why he used to be Spike Lee.

657
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,200
- This is so incredible.

658
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,920
People could go into the tower theater

659
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,710
and see a movie that my uncle Buddy made.

660
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,550
- Well that explains why he knows so much

661
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,593
about the movies.

662
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,770
Yo, Ella, if Mr J used to be Spike Lee,

663
00:32:39,770 --> 00:32:41,510
why don't he tell anybody?

664
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:43,537
I mean, Spike Lee always tell everybody,

665
00:32:43,537 --> 00:32:47,596
"Hey, I'm Spike Lee", and
people already know who he is.

666
00:32:47,596 --> 00:32:49,833
- Yeah, why is this
stuff such a big secret?

667
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,653
- Uh-oh.

668
00:32:55,814 --> 00:32:56,647
Hurry up.

669
00:32:58,715 --> 00:32:59,548
The hat.

670
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,628
- Get out, just get out.

671
00:33:04,628 --> 00:33:05,461
Get out of here.

672
00:33:09,394 --> 00:33:11,811
(slow music)

673
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:45,330
- So then the lights go back
on and the money is gone.

674
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:48,700
Who took it, the cheap
lawyer, the expensive lawyer

675
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,470
or the tooth fairy.

676
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:51,510
- The cheap lawyer.

677
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:53,680
- No, the expensive lawyer.

678
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,500
The cheap lawyer and the tooth fairy

679
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,503
are figments of your imagination.

680
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:01,950
Isn't that a good lawyer joke?

681
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,250
I figure going to law school
doesn't mean I have to lose

682
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,363
my sense of humor.

683
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,990
I think it's not good to let your studies

684
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:12,223
take over all your life.

685
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,857
I bet you never thought
you'd hear me say that,

686
00:34:14,857 --> 00:34:15,690
huh Ella.

687
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,920
- Should I bring up what happened today?

688
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,930
- I think you've waited long enough.

689
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,230
- Guess where I was today.

690
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,773
- Where.

691
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:33,736
- Paramount Studios.

692
00:34:33,736 --> 00:34:34,569
- Isn't that exciting.

693
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:35,900
- Yeah, I was sent over to fix a computer,

694
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:38,180
it wasn't anybody important,
just some executive.

695
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:40,850
And while I was there, I
kept thinking how you two

696
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:43,720
film buffs would enjoy
being on a real movie lot.

697
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:44,780
- Tell them who you saw.

698
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:46,750
- Oh yeah yeah, Mr. Spark.

699
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:48,450
The guy from the "Star Trek" movies,

700
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,420
the one with the ears.

701
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,770
He had on the ears too, I
mean it was makeup of course,

702
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:54,830
but there he was and there
I was walking side by side.

703
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,030
- Isn't that great.

704
00:35:00,336 --> 00:35:01,169
- Yeah.

705
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,000
- Now the best part about this

706
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,590
was that they have these
buildings over there

707
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:07,940
named after important Hollywood people.

708
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,680
They have the Cecil B. DeMille building,

709
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,080
they had a Lucille Ball building

710
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,430
and I saw the place where Eddie Murphy

711
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,160
has his production offices.

712
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,290
Way to go Eddie, huh.

713
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,470
- Is everything all right with you two?

714
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:23,740
- Fine.

715
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:24,573
- Great.

716
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,240
- I think I'll take my evening walk.

717
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,970
- Are you sure everything's all right?

718
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,410
- Yeah everything's cool, mom.

719
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:48,210
I'm just gonna go do the dishes now.

720
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,880
- Was that our daughter
volunteering to do the dishes?

721
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,130
- I don't know whether I should be happy

722
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:56,423
or go get a thermometer.

727
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,890
- Well nothing happened.

728
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,620
I mean something happened
but nothing really happened.

729
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,630
- Wait, wait, I'm missing something.

730
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:40,290
- Uncle Buddy didn't say
anything to my parents.

731
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:41,300
- Wow.

732
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,040
- Yeah but he's really mad at me.

733
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,744
Trust me, I can tell.

734
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:45,577
- [Mrs. Jackson] Ella.

735
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:47,033
- Yeah mom, I'm on the porch.

736
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,300
- Honey, uncle Buddy forgot his lunch.

737
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,290
Would you drop it by the barbershop?

738
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:55,220
- Mom, I've got basketball
practice in an hour.

739
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,130
- Then you have plenty of time.

740
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:59,700
Now here, I'm leaving this in your capable

741
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,980
but currently idle hands.

742
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:02,903
- Yes ma'am.

743
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:09,580
Alphonso, the barbershop's
the last place I wanna go.

744
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,820
- Ella, you and Mr. J are tight.

745
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,330
I mean, how bad could it be.

746
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,684
- [Commentator] Through four
and a half minutes of play,

747
00:37:15,684 --> 00:37:17,830
the Dodgers lead the Pittsburgh
Pirates three to one.

748
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,730
Okay, here we go.

749
00:37:18,730 --> 00:37:20,566
- Would you two hold it down,

750
00:37:20,566 --> 00:37:22,056
I'm trying to hear my ball game.

751
00:37:22,056 --> 00:37:22,889
- [Commentator] Heading for the Dodgers.

752
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:24,960
And the first Pittsburgh
drawback is hit hard

753
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,860
to the right side.

754
00:37:33,438 --> 00:37:35,816
- Well, hello Ella.

755
00:37:35,816 --> 00:37:36,657
- Hi.

756
00:37:36,657 --> 00:37:38,216
- Hi, cousin.

757
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:39,049
- Hi Ella.

758
00:37:40,769 --> 00:37:42,186
- Hi uncle Buddy.

759
00:37:45,188 --> 00:37:47,030
Uncle Buddy, I brought you your lunch.

760
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,880
Just put it over the counter, please.

761
00:37:59,915 --> 00:38:00,748
Thank you.

762
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,165
- You're right, this is pretty bad.

763
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:22,245
- Why is he treating me like this,

764
00:38:22,245 --> 00:38:24,263
all I did was open his stupid trunk.

765
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,233
- Yeah, he's definitely overreacting.

766
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,390
Ella, what are you looking at?

767
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:33,223
- Nothing.

768
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,293
- You're crying.

769
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:38,126
- No, I'm not.

770
00:38:38,126 --> 00:38:40,756
- All right, I'm sorry, it's my mistake.

771
00:38:40,756 --> 00:38:42,460
- Is that all you can do
is just joke all the time.

772
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,790
- Hey I'm sorry really,
don't cry about it.

773
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,800
- I can't help it.

774
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,610
I feel like I hurt him
and I don't know why

775
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,430
or how to fix it or anything.

776
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:52,900
- Well maybe you're not the
one that he's really mad at.

777
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:54,240
- Yeah, right.

778
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,280
- I mean think about
it, everything was fine

779
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,530
until this trunk came, right.

780
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,090
And all you really did was find out

781
00:38:59,090 --> 00:39:01,270
that he used to make films.

782
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,563
- Yeah, but why is he so angry about that.

783
00:39:03,563 --> 00:39:05,760
- It's not like it's some deep dark secret

784
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,750
and he's gonna end up on America's
most wanted or something.

785
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,480
- That's how he's acting.

786
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,773
- Yeah, we just gotta figure out why.

787
00:39:13,770 --> 00:39:15,440
- How are we supposed to do that?

788
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,143
- Why, why, why do I got
to come up with everything.

789
00:39:18,143 --> 00:39:19,848
- Oh, great.

790
00:39:19,848 --> 00:39:21,122
You know what I wish though,

791
00:39:21,122 --> 00:39:24,550
I wish we could find
somebody who knew him,

792
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:26,313
back when he was making movies.

793
00:39:27,669 --> 00:39:29,580
- There was a poster with
Ella Du Champs on it.

794
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,860
And it was the name of a theater on it.

795
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:33,190
- It was a Tower Theater in Los Angeles.

796
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,290
- Yeah, it's over on
Broadway and they still

797
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:36,660
show her films there.

798
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,820
- Are you think you and I'm thinking.

799
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,150
- Yo, it's worth a shot.

800
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,090
- Meet me here after practice, okay.

801
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,307
- Hey, got you covered.

802
00:39:43,307 --> 00:39:45,910
- Alphonso, this is a brilliant plan.

803
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:46,860
- Hey, I knew that.

804
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,370
- I don't know this
doesn't look right to me.

805
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,328
- How do you know that's
supposed to look like

806
00:39:57,328 --> 00:39:59,604
when you've never been here before.

807
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:00,820
- Are you sure you took the right bus.

808
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:03,250
- Look, Fo knows buses
to go visit my aunt.

809
00:40:03,250 --> 00:40:06,323
I once took the bus all the
way to Bakersfield by myself.

810
00:40:07,191 --> 00:40:08,570
- Well if we're lost,
you're gonna wish you stayed

811
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,823
in Bakersfield by yourself.

812
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:25,903
- See, that's (indistinct)

813
00:40:34,791 --> 00:40:36,720
(speaking foreign language)

814
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,083
- Well, way to go Fo.

815
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:44,570
(speaking foreign language)

816
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:46,890
- Don't tell me, he flunked Spanish I.

817
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:49,780
- And barely squeaked by in English.

818
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,790
- That's real funny, Ella.

819
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,680
- Listen, can you help
us, we're trying to get

820
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:54,850
some information.

821
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,500
Have you ever heard of a film called

822
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,780
'Two Gun Lily' from Lenox Avenue.

823
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,993
- Sorry Senorita.

824
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:03,620
- Well, have you ever
heard of a black director

825
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:05,420
named W.B Jackson.

826
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,000
- Are you sure you have the right place?

827
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,800
- Yeah, he had a film that
showed here a long time ago.

828
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,954
- Before you people were here.

829
00:41:12,954 --> 00:41:17,600
- We people have been in
California for 500 years.

830
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,720
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
that's not what I meant.

831
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,360
I'm talking about before when
this was a black theater,

832
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,410
you know before it was a Spanish theater.

833
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:28,233
- Maybe there is someone
here that can help you.

834
00:41:31,252 --> 00:41:32,085
- Boss, these (foreign language)

835
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:34,096
wanna ask you a couple questions.

836
00:41:34,096 --> 00:41:35,342
- What?

837
00:41:35,342 --> 00:41:40,083
- These ninos wanna ask
you a couple of questions.

838
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,717
- Come in.

839
00:41:41,717 --> 00:41:43,347
- Hi.

840
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:44,725
- What's on your mind?

841
00:41:44,725 --> 00:41:45,940
- Have you ever heard of a film called

842
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,160
'Two gun Lily' from Lenox Avenue.

843
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,503
- Heard of, I used to show it.

844
00:41:51,341 --> 00:41:52,950
- Then you know who W.B Jackson is.

845
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:57,030
- W.B Jackson, I haven't
heard that name in years.

846
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,660
- He's her uncle.

847
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:01,180
- So you are W.B Jackson's niece.

848
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,810
- Yeah, did you know him?

849
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:05,450
- No, but I sure admired his work.

850
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,883
I used to show his films
back in the old days.

851
00:42:08,762 --> 00:42:11,028
- Back when this was a black theater, huh.

852
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,397
- Back when this was a white theater.

853
00:42:14,397 --> 00:42:16,610
You don't know what I'm
talking about, do you?

854
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:19,340
See, six days out of the week,

855
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:22,450
this theater showed white Hollywood films.

856
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:26,120
But on Tuesday nights, they
used to run the race films.

857
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,300
They were films made by colored folks

858
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,450
with the colored casts.

859
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,253
We were colored back then.

860
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:35,500
Tuesday night was colored night.

861
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,860
- Wait a minute, you mean
to tell me that black,

862
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,700
I mean color filmmakers only got a chance

863
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:42,020
to show their films once a week?

864
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,870
- Sometimes not even that much, son.

865
00:42:44,870 --> 00:42:47,470
Remember, those times were even harder

866
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,103
for our people than today.

867
00:42:50,111 --> 00:42:51,970
If a colored filmmaker even got a chance

868
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:55,433
to show his film at all,
he was doing real good.

869
00:42:57,410 --> 00:43:02,200
Whenever we showed a W.D Jackson
film, the house was full.

870
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,180
Colored people from all over the city

871
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,690
would be in there to see him.

872
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,770
- Wow, his movies must
have been really good.

873
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,720
- He was one of the best.

874
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,440
And in my line of work, you know.

875
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,797
Of course, his films always
had Ella Du Champs in them.

876
00:43:17,797 --> 00:43:21,853
And she was so enough easy
on the eyes, yes indeed.

877
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,813
You know she was even in some
of those Hollywood films,

878
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:30,488
but all she ever got to play was maids.

879
00:43:30,488 --> 00:43:33,363
- But why Gus, if she was
such a good actress, then why.

880
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,100
- Ella Du Champs was a
gorgeous, intelligent,

881
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:39,270
and talented woman.

882
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:42,810
If they'd let her play what
she was instead of just maids,

883
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,470
they'd have had to look not just at her

884
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,160
but all other colored women
in an entirely different light

885
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,140
and colored men too.

886
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:54,690
Hollywood had a chance to
put an end to prejudice,

887
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:58,120
they just weren't brave or
smart enough to take it.

888
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:03,440
Hey this looks like my uncle Buddy's car.

889
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,550
- Hey Mr. J's car is a 54 Studebaker,

890
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,650
this is a 49 Ford.

891
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,000
- Finest ever built.

892
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,340
- Yeah girl, don't you know anything?

893
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:15,300
- Mr. Gus, do you have any
idea why my uncle Buddy

894
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,713
stopped making films?

895
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:23,530
- Believe me, it's no picnic
to be colored and have dreams.

896
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:28,580
I never met your uncle, but
I know from all the work

897
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:32,320
I've seen that W.B Jackson
put an awful lot of heart

898
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,323
into every one of his films.

899
00:44:36,190 --> 00:44:40,197
Takes a mighty big hurt to
kill a heart that strong.

900
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:49,420
- Mr. Gus, see there's this trunk.

901
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:53,687
- Speak up, I can't hear you.

902
00:44:57,817 --> 00:45:00,320
- We've got a copy of "The Creole Kid".

903
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,703
- You do?

904
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:03,470
Well have you seen it?

905
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:05,383
- No, but do you think that
there's anything in there

906
00:45:05,383 --> 00:45:07,318
that could help my uncle Buddy?

907
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:08,970
- You mean you've been
asking me all these questions

908
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:11,440
and you got the film
and you haven't seen it?

909
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,040
What's the matter with you kids.

910
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,510
- Mr. Gus, we need someone to show it.

911
00:45:17,403 --> 00:45:20,863
- What do I look like to
you, a race car driver.

912
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:28,243
- But we do.

913
00:45:29,170 --> 00:45:30,380
Well we do.

914
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,270
Listen, what good is
it gonna do your uncle

915
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:33,630
if it just stays in the trunk.

916
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:35,370
If you want to he can drop
the whole thing right now,

917
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,300
I don't care.

918
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,027
But if you really wanna help him.

919
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,577
- I know, I know, I just
hate it when you're right.

920
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,410
- Since you brought the film, I figured

921
00:45:48,410 --> 00:45:50,540
I shouldn't show up empty-handed.

922
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,060
Here's a little something
that might interest you,

923
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,013
my scrapbook.

924
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,053
Now this is Clarence Muse.

925
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:01,760
He used to act in race
films and Hollywood films.

926
00:46:02,847 --> 00:46:05,750
And he had his own dude
rants down near Lake Paris

927
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,930
where all the black
celebrities used to go.

928
00:46:07,930 --> 00:46:10,093
Folks like Joe Lewis.

929
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:14,190
You know who I'm talking about, don't you?

930
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:18,050
The brown bomber, the heavyweight
champion of the world.

931
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:19,403
- Oh, I knew that.

932
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,980
- That's Hattie McDaniel.

933
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,430
- You know who she is.

934
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:28,827
- She's only the first black
actress ever to win an Oscar.

935
00:46:28,827 --> 00:46:32,220
"Gone with the wind", 1939
and there have only been

936
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,600
four more black actors
to win ever since then.

937
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,990
- See, we know a lot of things.

938
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,090
- Hattie was such a good actress.

939
00:46:40,090 --> 00:46:43,710
She brought such bearing,
such dignity to those parts

940
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:46,410
that folks left the theater
talking about the maid,

941
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:47,743
not the mistress.

942
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:50,130
Of course there were some white folks

943
00:46:50,130 --> 00:46:55,110
who felt she was too
familiar with her employers,

944
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,567
too uppity, that was their word for her.

945
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,680
Oh, listen to me rattling on

946
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,870
like we don't have a movie to see.

947
00:47:03,870 --> 00:47:06,313
Okay it's show time.

948
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:09,756
- Yeah, "The Creole Kid".

949
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,393
Reel one.

950
00:47:14,987 --> 00:47:17,510
- Did you kids put the tape on this can?

951
00:47:17,510 --> 00:47:18,343
- No.

952
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:24,213
- Do you have any idea when
whoever did it, did it?

953
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:27,020
- No, why, is there something wrong?

954
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,440
- If it's old nitrate film,
which is what I think it is,

955
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:32,170
you got a problem.

956
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:34,810
Nitrate film deteriorates.

957
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,593
You may have a movie in here
or you may have a can of mush.

958
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,573
- Great.

959
00:47:41,573 --> 00:47:43,990
- Well, can you open it
so that we can find out?

960
00:47:43,990 --> 00:47:46,663
- As long as this can stay
sealed up, you're fine.

961
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:51,580
But opening this up is a job for experts.

962
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,580
You better talk to my friend
at the American Film Institute.

963
00:48:00,080 --> 00:48:01,100
(knocks on door)

964
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,580
- Come in.

965
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:05,520
- Hello, we're looking for Ricky Sewell.

966
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,650
- Yeah, well you can stop looking.

967
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:08,880
Ooh do you smoke?

968
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:10,070
- Say what?

969
00:48:10,070 --> 00:48:13,610
- It's bad for you and it's
really bad for the film.

970
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:16,250
Nitrate film stock, very volatile.

971
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,070
Gets near the flame
and all you've got left

972
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:22,010
is a bunch of stinking smoke
and some funky old ashes.

973
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:24,230
- Excuse me but didn't Gus Middleton,

974
00:48:24,230 --> 00:48:25,790
the projectionist call you?

975
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:28,910
- Oh, you're the kids
with the W.B Jackson film.

976
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,810
Well, why didn't you say so.

977
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:31,643
Come on.

978
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:36,360
Well if she did a good
job of taping the can,

979
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,090
which she obviously did
and kept it in a cool place

980
00:48:40,090 --> 00:48:44,010
like a basement, it could
easily last for 50 years.

981
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:45,420
- And if she didn't.

982
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:48,784
- Well let's just hope she
knew what she was doing, okay.

983
00:48:48,784 --> 00:48:50,330
All right ready?

984
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,180
- Yes.

985
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,013
- Let's do it.

986
00:48:57,730 --> 00:49:01,670
Oh something smell like rotten eggs.

987
00:49:01,670 --> 00:49:05,000
- A little sulfur smell is normal, yeah.

988
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,710
Ooh, it's not sticky, it's nice and dry.

989
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:10,230
- Well, what does that mean?

990
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:14,240
- That means that Ella
Du Champs was as clever

991
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:15,720
as she was beautiful.

992
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,290
- [All] Oh all right.

993
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,820
- Now we can take a look at the film.

994
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,070
- Oh no, not yet.

995
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,100
It needs to be sent to the lab at UCLA

996
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,000
to soak in renovx for three days,

997
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,765
then we can run it just
once through the flatbed

998
00:49:26,765 --> 00:49:29,130
and then we gotta get this baby preserved.

999
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,305
- Three days?

1000
00:49:30,305 --> 00:49:31,427
- Yeah.

1001
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,603
- I don't know how we're
gonna last that long

1002
00:49:32,603 --> 00:49:35,133
with this whole mystery on my mind 24/7.

1003
00:49:35,133 --> 00:49:36,043
know what I mean.

1004
00:49:36,982 --> 00:49:40,065
(instrumental music)

1005
00:49:46,656 --> 00:49:50,656
- I just have to see this
opening one more time.

1006
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,933
What a brilliant opening sequence.

1007
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,480
- Seen that plenty of times.

1008
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:03,910
- Yes now.

1009
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:05,990
But a tracking shot with a running horse

1010
00:50:05,990 --> 00:50:10,130
had rarely been done in race
films and he did it looking up

1011
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:10,963
at the rider.

1012
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:14,080
- Yeah, you know right
away that the creole kid

1013
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,080
is the hero.

1014
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,290
- That's right, just like your uncle.

1015
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:20,120
- Do you really think that
my uncle Buddy's a hero.

1016
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,330
- I do, I absolutely do.

1017
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:24,650
And you want me to show you why.

1018
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,700
This was my student film
project when I first came here.

1019
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:29,990
It's called the Hollywood hall of shame.

1020
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,280
This is how Hollywood
portrayed black Americans

1021
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,563
in the 1930s.

1022
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:39,723
That's Ben Crosby in blackface.

1023
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,520
- Hey, you're late, stupid.

1024
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,353
- Oh me?

1025
00:50:45,353 --> 00:50:47,725
- Yes, right through
that door, stage three.

1026
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:48,892
Yeah hurry up.

1027
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:53,610
- Hey, what's the idea, you're late.

1028
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:55,560
- But, boy I'm lucky to be here at all.

1029
00:50:57,106 --> 00:50:58,640
- Samson, get up or you gonna be late

1030
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:00,040
for your afternoon nap.

1031
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:02,263
- Now this is an Ethel Waters movie.

1032
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,740
My goodness, maybe he's dead.

1033
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,220
- Yeah from the neck up.

1034
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:13,020
This will get it, lunch is served.

1035
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:20,800
- Did I hear y'all say
something about lunch.

1036
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,370
- You sure did but just
make believe I was fooling

1037
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:25,230
'cause you ain't get none know how.

1038
00:51:25,230 --> 00:51:26,960
- Well I ain't did nothing.

1039
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,503
- As jazz did.

1040
00:51:29,443 --> 00:51:31,290
- No kid it'd be no clowns snatching back

1041
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,647
and stuffing sounds from the job,

1042
00:51:34,782 --> 00:51:38,283
put it down oh can't leave it later.

1043
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:42,550
Bring it down, (indistinct)

1044
00:51:44,260 --> 00:51:46,270
- That's Steppen Fetchet.

1045
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,050
- Is that his real name.

1046
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,610
- Lincoln Perry's his real name

1047
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:51,340
but he did lots of Hollywood films

1048
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:53,410
as Steppen Fetchet.

1049
00:51:53,410 --> 00:51:54,310
This is him again.

1050
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:56,845
- What's your name.

1051
00:51:56,845 --> 00:52:00,340
- I was baptized David Begets Solomon.

1052
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,028
- David Begets what?

1053
00:52:02,028 --> 00:52:04,420
- David begets Solomon about saying

1054
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,540
George Lincoln Watson.

1055
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,030
- Well now listen, if
you're going with me,

1056
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:10,921
we're gonna stick right to
the bible, you're a Jonah.

1057
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:11,754
- Oh, I am...

1058
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,030
- [Ella] That's Shirley Temple.

1059
00:52:13,030 --> 00:52:14,060
- [Alphonso] And Hattie McDaniel.

1060
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:16,333
- [Rickie] Yes, and
Bill Bojangles Robinson.

1061
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:18,192
- You aint got no money.

1062
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,800
M-O-N-I-E.

1063
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:26,360
- Not only that, we most out of F-U-D-E.

1064
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:27,320
- They can't even spell.

1065
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,223
- That's too bad, look here.

1066
00:52:30,330 --> 00:52:35,330
Wouldn't they K-U-N-E-L
give a little L-O-N-E.

1067
00:52:36,610 --> 00:52:39,370
- You know miss Elizabeth
wouldn't take nothing from him.

1068
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:41,656
Why before she'd do that, she'd go to the

1069
00:52:41,656 --> 00:52:45,863
P-O-H-O-S.

1070
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:50,283
- P-O-H-O-S.

1071
00:52:50,283 --> 00:52:51,893
- Yeah sure, ain't you got no education.

1072
00:52:51,893 --> 00:52:53,860
Poor house.

1073
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,563
- Now compare that image to this one.

1074
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:05,130
- [Alphonso] That Creole
kid was a straight-up hero.

1075
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:06,340
- That's right.

1076
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:08,610
W.B. Jackson, Oscar Michelle

1077
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,560
and the Lincoln Motion
Picture Film Company

1078
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:13,350
and all the other pioneers
were the real heroes.

1079
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,010
They had to do it all
themselves from finance

1080
00:53:16,010 --> 00:53:17,400
to final cut.

1081
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:20,160
People like your uncle,
Ella laid the groundwork

1082
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,280
for us today.

1083
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,210
- Then what made them stop?

1084
00:53:23,210 --> 00:53:26,060
- Well lots of filmmakers
stopped, Alphonso.

1085
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,790
I mean once Hollywood got
the drift that black movies

1086
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:32,980
were a good business, they
started making it themselves.

1087
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:35,650
- But that doesn't explain
why he never talks about it.

1088
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,530
And why is he hiding who he really is.

1089
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:39,252
What happened to him?

1090
00:53:39,252 --> 00:53:40,720
- I don't know Alphonso,
but the sure thing

1091
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:42,550
is that he's not gonna tell us,

1092
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:45,000
so we're just gonna
have to figure this out.

1093
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,670
- Well you know, you
could start right here.

1094
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:51,700
We have one of the best film
libraries in the country.

1095
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,200
- Well then maybe we can
find an old newspaper

1096
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:56,010
or a magazine or a book or something

1097
00:53:56,010 --> 00:53:58,200
that'll tell us what
happened to uncle Buddy.

1098
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,380
- Well now that sounds like a plan.

1099
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:03,550
Meanwhile I'm gonna get
this film to the lab

1100
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:07,160
and start restoring the picture
and cleaning up the sound.

1101
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,870
- Ricky, I appreciate
everything you're doing for me.

1102
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:12,080
- Oh please do you know how rare it is

1103
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:14,270
to find one of these
black independent films

1104
00:54:14,270 --> 00:54:17,240
in good condition, it's our heritage.

1105
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:20,253
And besides there is a little
something in it for me.

1106
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:26,263
After you get your uncle
Buddy back, I want him.

1107
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:34,993
25.

1108
00:54:34,993 --> 00:54:37,900
- Right I talked to coach Dawson today.

1109
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,680
Appealed coach Dawson.

1110
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,423
You missed practice, where were you?

1111
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,130
- I was late and you know
how she is about being late,

1112
00:54:46,130 --> 00:54:47,640
so I skipped it.

1113
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,360
- Oh well, why did you just say so.

1114
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,890
No big deal, right.

1115
00:54:50,890 --> 00:54:53,450
Your team is just getting ready
for the league championship,

1116
00:54:53,450 --> 00:54:55,640
you don't need to practice.

1117
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:57,190
- But I'm practicing now, Daddy.

1118
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:01,190
- Ella, you made a commitment
to the team and to yourself.

1119
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,790
Now you're 19 points away from being

1120
00:55:02,790 --> 00:55:04,680
the league scoring champion.

1121
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,830
19 points, I've seen you scored
19 points in one quarter.

1122
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:10,230
- Wow, I didn't know
you were keeping track.

1123
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:11,280
- Well, I keep track

1124
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,650
and so do a lot of other people.

1125
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:16,110
Look baby doll, if you're the star

1126
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:18,250
in the right high school
program, you can write

1127
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:20,180
your own ticket to college.

1128
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:22,140
- But daddy, maybe basketball
isn't the only thing

1129
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,890
happening for me now.

1130
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,590
- What's that supposed to mean?

1131
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:27,630
- Nothing, never mind.

1132
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:29,890
- This have anything to do with boys?

1133
00:55:29,890 --> 00:55:30,940
- No, daddy.

1134
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,293
- Oh then what is it?

1135
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,240
- Can I just practice my free throws?

1136
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,073
- Yeah.

1137
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,850
Uncle Buddy, how you doing?

1138
00:55:43,718 --> 00:55:46,290
- Evening, Joe, Ella.

1139
00:55:46,290 --> 00:55:47,223
- Hi uncle Buddy.

1140
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:57,900
- I don't know what's
going on with those two.

1141
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,950
They used to be inseparable,

1142
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,510
now they can't get far enough apart.

1143
00:56:01,510 --> 00:56:02,490
- I don't know.

1144
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:04,368
- I think I wanna talk to uncle Buddy

1145
00:56:04,368 --> 00:56:05,260
and get to the bottom of this.

1146
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:06,790
- Jonah don't interfere.

1147
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:09,673
Whatever it is, they need to
work it out for themselves.

1148
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,847
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

1149
00:56:12,847 --> 00:56:15,650
- All right, I've called
around the country

1150
00:56:15,650 --> 00:56:17,970
to every museum and
scholar I can think of.

1151
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:20,210
I looked at the credits
on all uncle Buddy's films

1152
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,300
and I've come up with a list
of names of all the people

1153
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,526
he's worked with.

1154
00:56:23,526 --> 00:56:24,970
- All right.

1155
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:26,637
- Come on, let's go.

1156
00:56:28,208 --> 00:56:30,541
Come on, shoot it, shoot it.

1157
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:38,283
- Sorry.

1158
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,323
(instrumental music)

1159
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,712
- That's a big day, we're
gonna take that championship.

1160
00:57:10,712 --> 00:57:12,444
- [All] Yeah.

1161
00:57:12,444 --> 00:57:13,862
- Break on three.

1162
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:15,872
One, two, three.

1163
00:57:15,872 --> 00:57:18,122
(applause)

1164
00:57:20,981 --> 00:57:21,814
- Can you come over tonight?

1165
00:57:21,814 --> 00:57:23,303
- No, we're gonna go see a film.

1166
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:30,350
- Now that's what I call a movie.

1167
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:31,820
When that kid refused to join that gang,

1168
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,370
I was so proud of him, I could have cried.

1169
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,550
- You did cry.

1170
00:57:34,550 --> 00:57:36,140
Don't think for a minute I believed

1171
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,210
you were really sneezing.

1172
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:38,370
- I never cry.

1173
00:57:38,370 --> 00:57:39,860
- Oh daddy, remember the time we watched

1174
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:41,097
the "Poseidon Adventure".

1175
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:42,899
- I don't wanna talk about that.

1176
00:57:42,899 --> 00:57:44,867
(laughter)

1177
00:57:44,867 --> 00:57:45,836
- Ella.

1178
00:57:45,836 --> 00:57:48,336
(car hooting)

1179
00:57:49,530 --> 00:57:51,550
Hi, is this your house.

1180
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:52,960
- What are you doing here Rickie.

1181
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,880
- Well I could say I was just returning

1182
00:57:54,880 --> 00:57:57,790
the original reels from the
lab plus a gorgeous transfer,

1183
00:57:57,790 --> 00:58:01,049
but the truth is I was hoping
to say hello to your uncle.

1184
00:58:01,049 --> 00:58:01,882
You're a friend of uncle Buddy's.

1185
00:58:01,882 --> 00:58:04,940
- Not exactly, she's a friend of mine.

1186
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,080
This is Rickie Sewell from AFI.

1187
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:08,317
- Hi.

1188
00:58:08,317 --> 00:58:09,150
- How do you do.

1189
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,130
- Is that the American Film Institute.

1190
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:11,130
- Oh yes.

1191
00:58:11,130 --> 00:58:13,100
Oh, I have this for you.

1192
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,321
- Well let me help you.

1193
00:58:14,321 --> 00:58:15,353
- No, it's okay dad, I got it.

1194
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:27,790
- You're telling me that
my uncle Buddy, the barber

1195
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:30,613
is in reality the filmmaker W.B Jackson.

1196
00:58:31,798 --> 00:58:33,200
Are we talking about the same uncle Buddy

1197
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,650
who has never mentioned
a word of this to me

1198
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:35,833
in my entire life.

1199
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,633
That was great.

1200
00:58:46,660 --> 00:58:50,028
Ella, I understand why
you did what you did,

1201
00:58:50,028 --> 00:58:51,850
but I don't understand why uncle Buddy

1202
00:58:51,850 --> 00:58:53,790
hid this from everybody for so many years.

1203
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:55,963
- Maybe that's none of anybody's business.

1204
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,320
Maybe none of you know
what it's like to fail

1205
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:10,633
so miserably at something you truly loved.

1206
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:14,230
- But uncle Buddy, you didn't fail.

1207
00:59:14,230 --> 00:59:16,870
- Child, how dare you
tell me what to think

1208
00:59:16,870 --> 00:59:18,123
of my own life.

1209
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,193
- Ella.

1210
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,103
- Here, I just had conscious (indistinct).

1211
00:59:52,117 --> 00:59:53,803
- Alphonso, I think I've lost him.

1212
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,697
Rickie came over with a copy of the film

1213
00:59:57,697 --> 00:59:59,293
and uncle Buddy walked in.

1214
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:01,540
And he's so upset, I don't think

1215
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,720
he'll ever talk to me again.

1216
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:05,730
- Come on, it's gonna be okay.

1217
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:07,053
- It's worse than ever.

1218
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:09,890
- Ella, it's not your fault.

1219
01:00:11,153 --> 01:00:12,563
- I just feel so helpless.

1220
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:17,710
- Hey, we'll think of something.

1221
01:00:17,710 --> 01:00:18,933
Tomorrow's another day.

1222
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:23,063
- I finally got one right.

1223
01:00:24,308 --> 01:00:25,203
- Well, what?

1224
01:00:26,320 --> 01:00:29,515
- Tomorrow's another day and
it's from "Gone with the wind."

1225
01:00:29,515 --> 01:00:31,273
- Oh, oh, I knew that.

1226
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,830
- Alphonso, you're always
here when I need you.

1227
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:42,015
- Well, you know everybody's
gotta be somewhere.

1228
01:00:42,015 --> 01:00:43,765
- I'm really glad that you're here.

1229
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,800
- I like knowing that.

1230
01:00:48,341 --> 01:00:50,862
- You know I couldn't have
done any of it without you.

1231
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:53,193
All those phone calls
and all that research.

1232
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,333
That's it.

1233
01:01:03,758 --> 01:01:04,760
- What's it?

1234
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:05,863
- The research.

1235
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,036
Come on let's go.

1236
01:01:08,036 --> 01:01:08,869
- Where are we going?

1237
01:01:08,869 --> 01:01:09,702
- To my house.

1238
01:01:09,702 --> 01:01:11,480
I'll use the phone upstairs and you use

1239
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:12,490
the phone downstairs.

1240
01:01:12,490 --> 01:01:15,163
Come on, we have to find
somebody who knew him.

1241
01:01:15,163 --> 01:01:18,246
(instrumental music)

1242
01:01:22,270 --> 01:01:25,023
- Hello, is this Mr. Washington?

1243
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:28,383
My name's Ella Jackson and I was told

1244
01:01:28,383 --> 01:01:31,543
that you might have known
my uncle W.B Jackson.

1245
01:01:33,050 --> 01:01:33,883
You did?

1246
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:36,120
Alphonso, guess what.

1247
01:01:36,120 --> 01:01:37,080
- So give me the 4-1-1.

1248
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:38,630
- I found somebody who knows him.

1249
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:39,463
- You did, who?

1250
01:01:39,463 --> 01:01:40,296
- Buck Washington.

1251
01:01:40,296 --> 01:01:42,190
He was an actor in uncle Buddy's films.

1252
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:44,480
- All right this was like
a miracle or something.

1253
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:45,440
He's going out of town.

1254
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:46,580
One more day he would have been gone,

1255
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:47,677
but guess what.

1256
01:01:47,677 --> 01:01:48,600
- What.

1257
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,433
- I get to see him tomorrow afternoon.

1258
01:01:49,433 --> 01:01:50,470
- Ella, wow, tomorrow.

1259
01:01:50,470 --> 01:01:52,390
Tomorrow's the game, the game.

1260
01:01:52,390 --> 01:01:55,990
- I can do both really.

1261
01:01:55,990 --> 01:01:57,123
Trust Fo.

1262
01:02:01,830 --> 01:02:03,700
- The tall tan Texan.

1263
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,453
Wow, Ella that's one of
your uncle Buddy's films.

1264
01:02:07,604 --> 01:02:10,000
- I played the villain of the piece,

1265
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,690
the corrupt sheriff and the employee

1266
01:02:11,690 --> 01:02:13,410
of the evil cattle band.

1267
01:02:14,337 --> 01:02:15,650
Oh you must be Ella.

1268
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,670
- Hi.

1269
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:17,810
- And I'm Alphonso.

1270
01:02:17,810 --> 01:02:19,333
- Alphonso, welcome.

1271
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,140
Yep that's the biggest
role I ever did with WB

1272
01:02:23,140 --> 01:02:24,710
as we knew him.

1273
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:26,970
I can't tell you how
marvelous it is to know

1274
01:02:26,970 --> 01:02:28,620
that he's still with us.

1275
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:29,973
Please come, have a seat.

1276
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:38,440
- Wow, you really done a lot of stuff.

1277
01:02:38,440 --> 01:02:41,732
The lady who let us in
said you had a long career.

1278
01:02:41,732 --> 01:02:43,563
- Well, it's been a struggle,

1279
01:02:44,630 --> 01:02:46,720
but it has had its moments.

1280
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:50,830
I was the original banana in
the cornflakes commercials.

1281
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:52,610
- Hey, I've never seen those.

1282
01:02:52,610 --> 01:02:54,610
- Well, perhaps it was before your time.

1283
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:56,930
How old are you?

1284
01:02:56,930 --> 01:02:59,030
No, no, don't answer.

1285
01:02:59,030 --> 01:03:01,060
- Mr. Washington, did
you do a lot of movies

1286
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:02,660
with my uncle Buddy?

1287
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:05,160
- Well, I started as a bit player.

1288
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:08,520
By two films later, I had
my first co-starring role.

1289
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:10,930
- Wow, you must have been really good.

1290
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:14,280
- True, but it was your
uncle Buddy who gave me

1291
01:03:14,280 --> 01:03:17,040
the chance to grow and
to become even better.

1292
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,120
That was his style.

1293
01:03:19,120 --> 01:03:22,640
He assembled this marvelous
little repertory company.

1294
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,303
Myself of course, the
fabulous Ella Du Champs,

1295
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,950
Lester Lawrence, Juneberg Baker.

1296
01:03:30,950 --> 01:03:33,430
He's probably the funniest
man who ever lived.

1297
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:36,290
It was just a wonderful team of actors

1298
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:39,590
and W.B gave us the opportunity

1299
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:42,814
to do what all actors live to do.

1300
01:03:42,814 --> 01:03:45,460
What black actors seldom
get the chance to do.

1301
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:46,990
- What's that?

1302
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:49,360
- Act, just simply to act

1303
01:03:50,450 --> 01:03:53,620
without being stereotyped
by someone's prejudice

1304
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:56,330
or breathtaking lack of vision.

1305
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:59,240
- Mr. Washington, you knew my uncle Buddy,

1306
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:00,230
you worked with him.

1307
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:03,730
You said that he was great,
everybody said he was great.

1308
01:04:03,730 --> 01:04:06,303
I don't understand, what made him quit.

1309
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,470
- Well, your uncle Buddy
probably came closer

1310
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,823
than anyone else to breaking
through the color line.

1311
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:17,273
But in the end, I fear it broke him.

1312
01:04:18,484 --> 01:04:19,410
- What do you mean?

1313
01:04:19,410 --> 01:04:20,803
- Excuse me, Ella.

1314
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:24,290
- Alphonso, I can't leave yet.

1315
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:27,113
- Oh, yes your basketball game.

1316
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:30,853
Ella, this is for you.

1317
01:04:32,701 --> 01:04:36,340
This is your uncle Buddy as I knew him.

1318
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:37,470
- Wow.

1319
01:04:37,470 --> 01:04:39,100
Mr. Washington, please continue,

1320
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:40,300
I wanna hear this.

1321
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,100
- Well, I'll try to be brief.

1322
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,533
It all started one day when
W.B came back off the road.

1323
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:49,550
You see whenever we completed a film,

1324
01:04:49,550 --> 01:04:52,060
W.B would go on the
road from town to town,

1325
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:54,023
theater to theater showing the film.

1326
01:04:55,170 --> 01:04:56,810
Well, this particular day he came back

1327
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:58,763
with the most amazing news.

1328
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:04,740
He had just made a deal with
two white Hollywood producers

1329
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:07,930
and we were gonna make
a real Hollywood movie.

1330
01:05:07,930 --> 01:05:10,630
- Wow, my uncle Buddy
made a Hollywood movie.

1331
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:12,853
Nobody's ever said anything about that.

1332
01:05:14,100 --> 01:05:16,130
- Less said, the better.

1333
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,393
- Why, what happened.

1334
01:05:20,852 --> 01:05:23,490
- You know it takes only one straw

1335
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:25,213
to break the camel's back.

1336
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:31,500
So the deal for W.B's
Hollywood western was made,

1337
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,893
contracts just been signed.

1338
01:05:35,719 --> 01:05:39,263
And the bigwigs, wow,
they were so slap happy

1339
01:05:40,260 --> 01:05:41,920
about all the new audience money

1340
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,630
they're about to pull in,

1341
01:05:43,630 --> 01:05:47,770
they decided they'd
celebrate with a big party

1342
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:48,770
at the country club.

1343
01:05:49,892 --> 01:05:54,892
Old W.B got all dolled up I
tell you, he knew how to dress.

1344
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:59,020
He had Ella Du Champs on his arm

1345
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:01,490
and they were looking
just as fine as you please

1346
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:03,670
when they stepped out
of that rented limousine

1347
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,940
and walked right into
that fancy restaurant.

1348
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,367
But they couldn't get past the door.

1349
01:06:09,367 --> 01:06:10,200
- What?

1350
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,800
- Why, what happened?

1351
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:15,660
- Well, the Maitre D said
that colored weren't allowed

1352
01:06:16,714 --> 01:06:19,050
and W.B just laughed at him

1353
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:21,040
and told him not only was he going inside,

1354
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:24,490
but there was a dinner party
going on inside in his honor

1355
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:26,930
sponsored by the head of the studio.

1356
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:29,170
He gave him the man's name

1357
01:06:29,170 --> 01:06:31,740
and that waiter backed off.

1358
01:06:31,740 --> 01:06:33,500
- I bet he did.

1359
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:36,203
- Well, he went inside to check.

1360
01:06:40,700 --> 01:06:45,520
20 minutes later, he came back
with the head of the studio

1361
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,330
with a napkin tucked under his chin

1362
01:06:47,330 --> 01:06:50,490
and a champagne glass in his hand,

1363
01:06:50,490 --> 01:06:52,783
but he verified that he knew W.B.

1364
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,890
- And then they let him inside.

1365
01:06:55,890 --> 01:06:56,830
- No darling.

1366
01:06:58,230 --> 01:07:01,310
The head of the studio said
there'd been some mistake,

1367
01:07:01,310 --> 01:07:03,960
that he hadn't known that W.B himself

1368
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:05,090
had intended to come.

1369
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:09,123
And besides, the party
was for the picture,

1370
01:07:10,003 --> 01:07:11,397
the picture.

1371
01:07:11,397 --> 01:07:14,200
The country club served only whites

1372
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:17,370
but if W.B and Ella wanted
to go around the back,

1373
01:07:17,370 --> 01:07:19,100
perhaps they could set up a small table

1374
01:07:19,100 --> 01:07:22,153
and a couple of chairs
just in the kitchen.

1375
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:31,183
It only takes that one final straw.

1376
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:40,940
Ella and me, well, we kept
on doing Hollywood movies.

1377
01:07:45,653 --> 01:07:47,603
But W.B, I believe that was that straw.

1378
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:57,470
- Great, we barely have
enough time to get to the bus

1379
01:07:57,470 --> 01:07:59,820
and get you to your game on time.

1380
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:02,270
Well, Bo, you're really
close to blowing it now.

1381
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:04,350
Hello Bo, are you with me
or should I have scotty

1382
01:08:04,350 --> 01:08:05,650
beam you up.

1383
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:07,120
Hey, where you going?

1384
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:10,670
- I gotta go this way, catch
the bus back to uncle Buddy's.

1385
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,160
- Are you crazy?

1386
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,420
What about the game, the
scholarship, the trophy.

1387
01:08:14,420 --> 01:08:15,570
- Alphonso, I hurt him.

1388
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:18,110
When I opened up that trunk,
I opened up a lot of pain.

1389
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:20,150
I gotta go back and tell him I'm sorry.

1390
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:21,470
I didn't know what he had gone through,

1391
01:08:21,470 --> 01:08:23,310
I didn't know about his dream.

1392
01:08:23,310 --> 01:08:24,930
- Ella, talk to him after the game,

1393
01:08:24,930 --> 01:08:25,940
this is the big one.

1394
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:27,900
You can't possibly make
it to the game on time

1395
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:28,950
if you go there first.

1396
01:08:28,950 --> 01:08:31,550
- I gotta go now, you catch
the bus and cover for me.

1397
01:08:31,550 --> 01:08:32,453
- Cover for you.

1398
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,973
Yeah, right.

1399
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,813
- Doesn't it seem just
a little strange to you

1400
01:08:40,813 --> 01:08:43,566
that Buddy is not going to Ella's game.

1401
01:08:43,566 --> 01:08:45,740
I mean it is the championship.

1402
01:08:45,740 --> 01:08:47,910
And when I asked him
about it, he just said

1403
01:08:47,910 --> 01:08:48,743
he wasn't going.

1404
01:08:50,075 --> 01:08:51,717
- That is strange.

1405
01:08:51,717 --> 01:08:55,490
- It sure is.

1406
01:08:55,490 --> 01:08:56,490
- Good night, Buddy.

1407
01:09:14,027 --> 01:09:15,120
- Where is she?

1408
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,470
- Joe, this isn't like her.

1409
01:09:18,216 --> 01:09:19,512
- I just want to know she's all right,

1410
01:09:19,512 --> 01:09:21,034
then I wanna kill her.

1411
01:09:21,034 --> 01:09:23,784
(crowd cheering)

1412
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:12,723
- Uncle Buddy.

1413
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,850
Uncle Buddy, please talk to me.

1414
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,973
- I used to talk to you.

1415
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,223
I used to talk to you all the time.

1416
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,540
I used to think that you were
the only person in the world

1417
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:33,793
who understood me.

1418
01:10:35,290 --> 01:10:36,193
I trusted you.

1419
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,022
- Then why did you hide this from me?

1420
01:10:40,022 --> 01:10:42,030
- Because it was none of your business.

1421
01:10:42,030 --> 01:10:45,090
If you had just minded your own business

1422
01:10:45,090 --> 01:10:47,500
and left that full trunk alone.

1423
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:50,380
- Then I would have never
found out who you really are.

1424
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:52,940
People love and respect you.

1425
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,750
Uncle Buddy, you're an
inspiration to people

1426
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,890
making movies now.

1427
01:10:56,890 --> 01:10:59,680
- Who's been filling your
head with such nonsense.

1428
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:00,880
- Buck Washington.

1429
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:03,860
He told me how brave
and courageous you were,

1430
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,480
how you wouldn't back down,

1431
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:07,090
how those white men at that restaurant.

1432
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:09,840
- Ella, you don't know
what you're talking about.

1433
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:14,000
- I do, I know that no one
should take that kind of insult.

1434
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:15,800
They hurt you.

1435
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:16,913
I'm sorry.

1436
01:11:18,426 --> 01:11:19,690
- Oh, little girl, little girl,

1437
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,360
I've been through much worse than that,

1438
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:23,623
it never stopped me.

1439
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:33,100
Ever since I first held
a camera in my hand,

1440
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:35,110
I was on a mission.

1441
01:11:35,110 --> 01:11:37,550
I was gonna take my company to Hollywood,

1442
01:11:37,550 --> 01:11:40,770
get inside the system and
make the kind of films

1443
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:43,530
we all dreamed of, where
I could show black people

1444
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:45,037
as people.

1445
01:11:45,037 --> 01:11:46,510
Well it never happened.

1446
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,790
- What do you mean?

1447
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:51,580
- I knew the days of race
films were coming to an end

1448
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:54,420
and I was determined to
keep on making movies.

1449
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:57,450
I had gotten myself a Hollywood contract.

1450
01:11:57,450 --> 01:11:59,800
You know how rare that was.

1451
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:03,520
They gave me more money to make one film

1452
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:05,913
than I had spent in all my films combined.

1453
01:12:06,850 --> 01:12:09,123
Man, I had business at the country club.

1454
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,153
It did hurt me, I can't deny it,

1455
01:12:15,300 --> 01:12:17,173
but it didn't stop me, Ella.

1456
01:12:22,522 --> 01:12:26,240
The next day on the set, I
pretended nothing had happened.

1457
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:27,923
After all for them, nothing had.

1458
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:33,380
My whole company was there, Ella Du Champs

1459
01:12:33,380 --> 01:12:35,300
looking lovely as ever.

1460
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:38,760
She was all set to play
this female gunslinger

1461
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:42,430
who falls madly in love
with this fearless sheriff

1462
01:12:42,430 --> 01:12:43,263
played by...

1463
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,203
- Buck Washington.

1464
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:46,233
- Right.

1465
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,430
No sooner had we got the cameras rolling,

1466
01:12:49,430 --> 01:12:52,300
than these studio execs, the
same guys from the dinner

1467
01:12:52,300 --> 01:12:53,633
came strolling up to me.

1468
01:12:55,194 --> 01:12:56,800
They didn't like Ella's costume.

1469
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,590
They wanted it shorter, skimpier.

1470
01:12:59,590 --> 01:13:02,290
I protested but then Ella stepped in

1471
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:03,453
trying to protect me.

1472
01:13:04,842 --> 01:13:09,350
She said she didn't mind,
she could make a burlap bag

1473
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:12,473
look good and she did.

1474
01:13:14,160 --> 01:13:15,803
Then they started on Buck.

1475
01:13:17,210 --> 01:13:20,460
Why I make this sheriff
so serious all the time.

1476
01:13:20,460 --> 01:13:22,763
Who's gonna believe a serious black man.

1477
01:13:24,070 --> 01:13:26,120
Why not throw in a couple of eye rolls,

1478
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:27,530
a couple of knee slaps.

1479
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:30,150
- But it was your movie,
you were the director.

1480
01:13:30,150 --> 01:13:34,450
- No, it wasn't, not anymore.

1481
01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:38,720
From the first day, they overrode
everything I wanted to do,

1482
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,223
every decision I made.

1483
01:13:41,210 --> 01:13:45,140
If I managed by some
chance to shoot a scene

1484
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:48,370
the way I wanted to,
they'd have their boys

1485
01:13:48,370 --> 01:13:50,870
in the editing room change it all around

1486
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:52,700
to the way they wanted it to be.

1487
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:54,720
the way they wanted black people to be.

1488
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,803
Before it was over, Buck was
almost wearing blackface.

1489
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:02,057
And Ella, my beautiful Ella.

1490
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:09,380
She was dressed like a tramp.

1491
01:14:12,550 --> 01:14:16,477
To see her like that, to
see what they did to her.

1492
01:14:18,082 --> 01:14:20,266
- You couldn't stop it?

1493
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:21,433
- No, I tried.

1494
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:26,550
Oh I was able to protect
them from some things,

1495
01:14:26,550 --> 01:14:30,273
but in the end, they suffered.

1496
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:35,530
Ella and I were engaged to be married.

1497
01:14:46,770 --> 01:14:49,220
And the dream I had promised
them, the dream of honor

1498
01:14:49,220 --> 01:14:52,260
and dignity and respect was dead.

1499
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:54,663
All the life kicked and yanked out of it.

1500
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:57,480
I failed them, honey.

1501
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:01,360
I failed the people that meant
the most to me in my life.

1502
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:02,853
- You gave them a start.

1503
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:06,300
You were just one person,
you couldn't do it

1504
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:07,670
all by yourself.

1505
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:10,790
But you made a beginning
for other black filmmakers.

1506
01:15:10,790 --> 01:15:12,790
Their success is your success.

1507
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:16,643
- Don't you have somewhere you have to be?

1508
01:15:21,393 --> 01:15:22,226
- I'm sorry uncle Buddy.

1509
01:15:23,703 --> 01:15:25,020
I'm sorry that I opened your trunk

1510
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,833
and let out all those
memories and all that hurt.

1511
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:33,020
I'm sorry that you couldn't
do what you wanted to do

1512
01:15:33,020 --> 01:15:34,153
for your friends.

1513
01:15:35,221 --> 01:15:37,804
(somber music)

1514
01:15:51,290 --> 01:15:53,966
Maybe you couldn't do it
the way that you wanted to,

1515
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:57,947
but you won uncle Buddy, you won.

1516
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:02,847
(somber music)

1517
01:16:28,933 --> 01:16:31,683
(crowd cheering)

1518
01:16:51,323 --> 01:16:52,906
- There's Alphonso.

1519
01:17:00,475 --> 01:17:01,308
- Mr. Jackson.

1520
01:17:01,308 --> 01:17:02,558
- Where's Ella?

1521
01:17:04,557 --> 01:17:05,687
- Oh, Ella.

1522
01:17:05,687 --> 01:17:06,520
Where's Ella.

1523
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:07,437
- Alphonso.

1524
01:17:09,729 --> 01:17:11,770
- There she is.

1525
01:17:11,770 --> 01:17:14,187
- [Coach] Watch your passing.

1526
01:17:19,533 --> 01:17:20,887
- She's here.

1527
01:17:20,887 --> 01:17:21,720
- Sorry I'm late.

1528
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:23,325
- Have a seat, Ella.

1529
01:17:23,325 --> 01:17:24,158
- But coach.

1530
01:17:24,158 --> 01:17:25,780
- I said, have a seat.

1531
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:26,670
- I can't believe you're gonna bench me.

1532
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:27,650
What about the game.

1533
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:29,732
- You sit there and
think think about that.

1534
01:17:29,732 --> 01:17:30,820
- Hey, what is that coach doing,

1535
01:17:30,820 --> 01:17:32,460
She's sitting here on the bench.

1536
01:17:32,460 --> 01:17:34,300
- You're complaining about
Ella getting benched.

1537
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:36,439
Two seconds ago you
were ready to kill her.

1538
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:37,420
- Yeah, but that coach is gonna cost Ella

1539
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:39,040
the high scores trophy.

1540
01:18:10,199 --> 01:18:12,532
- Come on guys, let's do it.

1541
01:18:13,722 --> 01:18:16,805
(instrumental music)

1542
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,472
- [Team] Go Lakers.

1543
01:18:49,325 --> 01:18:52,175
- All right girls, we have
come a long way together here.

1544
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:55,328
We got only a little bit further to go.

1545
01:18:55,328 --> 01:18:56,161
Are we gonna make it?

1546
01:18:56,161 --> 01:18:57,735
- [Team] Yes.

1547
01:18:57,735 --> 01:18:59,060
- Are we gonna get there?

1548
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,083
- [Team] Yes.

1549
01:19:00,989 --> 01:19:03,431
- I can't hear you,
are we gonna get there?

1550
01:19:03,431 --> 01:19:04,468
- [Team] Yes.

1551
01:19:04,468 --> 01:19:05,301
- All right.

1552
01:19:05,301 --> 01:19:07,551
(applause)

1553
01:19:08,919 --> 01:19:12,002
Ella, I want you to go in for Tamara.

1554
01:19:14,896 --> 01:19:16,229
- Get out there.

1555
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:28,106
- Two down in.

1556
01:19:28,106 --> 01:19:29,689
17 more to go, huh.

1557
01:19:49,895 --> 01:19:51,249
- It's okay, we'll get it next time.

1558
01:19:51,249 --> 01:19:54,332
(instrumental music)

1559
01:20:01,476 --> 01:20:03,380
- Come on, Ella.

1560
01:20:03,380 --> 01:20:04,353
You can do it, Ella.

1561
01:20:04,353 --> 01:20:06,270
Come on, Ella, come on.

1562
01:20:24,708 --> 01:20:25,541
Great pass, baby doll.

1563
01:20:25,541 --> 01:20:26,374
What, it was a good pass.

1564
01:20:26,374 --> 01:20:29,457
(instrumental music)

1565
01:21:01,803 --> 01:21:04,553
(crowd cheering)

1566
01:21:58,290 --> 01:21:59,551
- How many does Ella have?

1567
01:21:59,551 --> 01:22:00,384
- Uh 17.

1568
01:22:02,272 --> 01:22:05,355
(instrumental music)

1569
01:22:42,316 --> 01:22:43,245
Did you see what she just did?

1570
01:22:43,245 --> 01:22:44,864
- Yeah, of course I did, it was wonderful.

1571
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:46,638
- What do you mean wonderful,
she just blew the (indistinct)

1572
01:22:46,638 --> 01:22:47,892
- She did what is best for the team.

1573
01:22:47,892 --> 01:22:49,559
You should be proud.

1574
01:23:16,765 --> 01:23:18,617
- Free chicken for my girls.

1575
01:23:18,617 --> 01:23:20,867
Free chicken for everybody.

1576
01:23:23,467 --> 01:23:24,670
- Daddy, I didn't make high score.

1577
01:23:24,670 --> 01:23:26,014
- No.

1578
01:23:26,014 --> 01:23:26,912
- I'm sorry.

1579
01:23:26,912 --> 01:23:28,312
- Ella, I'm so proud of you.

1580
01:23:31,570 --> 01:23:33,030
