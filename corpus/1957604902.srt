Oh, where you been, L?

That's not the point.

218
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:55,306
The point is you can't be the

As you know, we already have

And I think that could be you.

311
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:06,497

produce your own stuff.

00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,630
Me?

313
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:12,764
Well, I mean, I just put that
rhyme on the track

314
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:13,983
just to give it some flavor.

315
00:14:14,027 --> 00:14:15,506
I mean, it's kind of a fluke.

316
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,899
I'm not really an MC.

317
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:18,379
But Lenore and I, we're a team.

318
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:20,337
You know, we work together well.

319
00:14:20,381 --> 00:14:23,993
Listen, I listen to a lot of
demos

320
00:14:24,037 --> 00:14:26,517
and very few rappers come off
the way you do.

Now, if you ask me, I think you
have the talent to pull it off.

322
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:32,306
So let me paint the broad
strokes so you

323
00:14:32,349 --> 00:14:33,698
can get a better perspective.

00:14:33,742 --> 00:14:36,397

00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,878

back--

326
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:42,577

possible contract.

00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,306
Oh, sure, take all the time you
need.

That's a lot of money.

341
00:15:33,715 --> 00:15:35,282
And I know if I do the work,
I'll get the pay.

342
00:15:40,983 --> 00:15:43,594
All right, you know, Lenore, if
you want us to walk out of here

343
00:15:43,638 --> 00:15:45,074
right now, I'm with you.

344
00:15:45,118 --> 00:15:46,771
I'll walk out of here right now.

345

If you really want us to walk
out of here right now,

346
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,862
because we're a team.

347
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,864
But I think we're like a couple
of damn fools

348
00:15:52,908 --> 00:15:55,606
to pass up on this money right
now as broke as we are.

349
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:01,003
I just want to make sure.

426
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:42,181
- No. - Gimme a kiss right now.

427
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:43,182
Gimme a kiss right now. - I'm
mad at you.

Stop it. Don't be.

Stop.

431
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,840
So what happened?

432
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:54,932
Well, OK, I'm going to do this
remix for Victoria.

433
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,630
And they want me to rap on it.

434
00:19:56,673 --> 00:19:58,675
It's like they see me like I'm
some kind of MC or something.

435
00:19:58,719 --> 00:20:00,764
It's kind of like-- it's
actually kind of weird.

436
00:20:00,808 --> 00:20:04,420
But whatever, I'm producing the
remix.

437
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,769
Victoria?

438
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:08,076
Yeah.

439
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:08,990
She gonna be there?

440
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:10,600
No, no, no, no. I doubt it.

441
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:11,906
I doubt if I even meet her, you
know?

442
00:20:11,949 --> 00:20:13,473
She's such a sort of big star.

443
00:20:13,516 --> 00:20:15,605
It's like I'll probably be in
the studio,

444
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:17,694
and then she'll probably be in
the studio.

445
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:19,435
We probably won't even see each
other.

446
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,828
It's like a studio thing, you
know?

447
00:20:20,871 --> 00:20:23,744
So when are you gonna work on
your own stuff?

448
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:26,137
Oh, well, that depends.

449
00:20:26,181 --> 00:20:29,619
It really depends on how the
single does.

450
00:20:29,663 --> 00:20:30,751
You know?

451
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:33,144
Because if the single doesn't do
well,

452
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,711
I might not get an album deal.

453
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,413
It'll do well.

454
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,850
It'll do great.

455
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:43,764

Gimme a kiss right now. Cut it
out.

00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,785

00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:08,702

462
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:09,964
No, come here. Don't do that.

little difficult.

She might try and test you, but
don't take it personal, OK?

No, no, I won't take it
personal.

probably handle

01:00:51,256 --> 01:00:53,867
Then you can call the shots.

1267
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:56,087
Now, come on, time is money.

1268
01:01:07,794 --> 01:01:10,405
The kid is good, but, I mean,
his head is not on straight.

1269
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:11,711
I need you to straighten him
out, man.

1270
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:15,019
Because this is getting
ridiculous.

1271
01:01:15,062 --> 01:01:16,760
All right, now that we're all
here,

1272
01:01:16,803 --> 01:01:19,023
I'm gonna leave you alone to do
your creative thing.

1273
01:01:19,066 --> 01:01:21,982
But no one is to leave this room
until we have a hit.

1274
01:01:44,222 --> 01:01:45,614
Nah, kid, come on.

1275
01:01:45,658 --> 01:01:47,486
You gotta let it flow. You know
what I'm saying?

1276
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:49,053
I'm not feeling this.

1277
01:01:49,096 --> 01:01:51,577
Yo, you ain't been feeling jack
since you been here, man.

1278
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,665
What's the deal?

1279
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,579
This ain't me.

1280
01:01:53,622 --> 01:01:55,146
I don't work this way.

1281
01:01:55,189 --> 01:01:58,540
Yo, let me ask you a question,
partner, how do you work?

1282
01:01:58,584 --> 01:02:00,325
Because ever since you got here,
all you've been doing

1283
01:02:00,368 --> 01:02:01,239
is complaining.

1284
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,544
And you know what?

1285
01:02:02,588 --> 01:02:04,242
We doing this for you, anyway.

1286
01:02:04,285 --> 01:02:05,504
That's the point.

1287
01:02:05,547 --> 01:02:06,679
I don't need y'all here to do
this for me.

1288
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,463
I can do it myself.

1289
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:09,508
I'm outta here.

1290
01:02:09,551 --> 01:02:10,770
I'm tired of these clowns
taking

1291
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:12,990
credit for my hard work, man.

1292
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:14,034
Hell, I'm out of here, man.

1293
01:02:17,081 --> 01:02:21,346
Yo, man, bring my car around.

1294
01:02:21,389 --> 01:02:31,748
[SINGING] Rhapsody, thinking
'bout the love we made.

1295
01:02:31,791 --> 01:02:35,752

1296
01:02:45,109 --> 01:02:46,023
You were great.

1297
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:46,893
You were great.

1298
01:02:46,937 --> 01:02:47,851
I'm proud of you.

1299
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:48,765
Now, get back to work.

1300
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:52,638
Jasmine.

1301
01:02:52,681 --> 01:02:54,074
You were so good.

1302
01:02:54,118 --> 01:02:56,511
And you look so pretty.

Lenore Foxwood.

1304
01:02:59,253 --> 01:03:00,167
Tony?

1305
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:01,865
Tony Spencer?

1306
01:03:01,908 --> 01:03:02,779
Oh my god.

1307
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:03,692
How you doing?

1308
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:05,085
Great.

1309
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:07,218
I'm sorry, Tony, Jasmine.

1310
01:03:07,261 --> 01:03:08,436
Nice to meet you.

1311
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,829
Nice to meet you.

1312
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:11,526
I haven't seen you since high
school.

1313
01:03:11,570 --> 01:03:12,789
Mm-hm.

1314
01:03:12,832 --> 01:03:14,529
So what are you doing, what's
up?

1315
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:16,183
Well, I'm managing talent now.

1316
01:03:16,227 --> 01:03:17,794
Really?

1317
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:19,665
In fact, I'm doing a cut on
this soundtrack for this movie

1318
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:21,145
called "Night Falls."

1319
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:22,842
"Night Falls," you know, that's
the movie I auditioned

1320
01:03:22,886 --> 01:03:25,149
for, but I didn't get.

1321
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:26,672
Lenore, I'm gonna give you my
home number.

1322
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:29,327
I want you to call me so we can
talk about Rhapsody.

1323
01:03:29,370 --> 01:03:31,677
OK.

1324
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,592
Hey, maybe we can have dinner
and catch up on old times,

1325
01:03:33,635 --> 01:03:34,898
all right? - Great.

1326
01:03:34,941 --> 01:03:36,464
- It's great seeing you. - It's
good to see you.

1327
01:03:36,508 --> 01:03:37,639
All right.

1328
01:03:37,683 --> 01:03:39,641
Your girl is crazy.

1329
01:03:39,685 --> 01:03:40,729
We'll call you, Tony.

1330
01:03:40,773 --> 01:03:43,210
Call me.

1331
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:44,298
He's fine.

1332
01:03:44,342 --> 01:03:45,212
Call him.

1333
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,395
You need to quit hitting the
juice, man.

1334
01:03:54,439 --> 01:03:55,527
Don't tell me what I need to
do!

1335
01:03:55,570 --> 01:03:56,789
Don't tell me what I need to do!

1336
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,225
Why don't you tell them what
they need to do?

1337
01:03:58,269 --> 01:03:59,139
I think you already did.

1338
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:00,010
We in here eight hours.

1339
01:04:00,053 --> 01:04:01,228
I know this.

1340
01:04:01,272 --> 01:04:02,360
I'm here, too, remember? - Just
queue up.

1341
01:04:02,403 --> 01:04:03,840
Queue 'em up. Queue 'em up.

1342
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:05,276
Queue 'em up. - All right, guys.

1343
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:07,582
I'm gonna kick back the reverb a
little bit in the cans.

1344
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:09,628
Let's do this.

1345
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:12,761
It's hot as hell in here.

1346
01:04:12,805 --> 01:04:18,115
LENORE: [SINGING] Rhapsody,

1347
01:04:18,158 --> 01:04:22,989
'bout the love we made.

1348

And cut.

1349
01:04:24,121 --> 01:04:25,949
Props, can we get that taken
care of.

1350
01:04:25,992 --> 01:04:28,125
So listen, yo, do you see this?

incredible.

01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:31,258
Incredible, bro.

1353
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:32,129
Thank you.

Thank you.

01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:34,044
She's making it happen.

1356
01:04:34,087 --> 01:04:35,523
She's putting it down.

1357
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:36,785
Let me go holler at her real
quick.

1358
01:04:36,829 --> 01:04:37,699
Do that. Do that.

1359
01:04:37,743 --> 01:04:39,397
Hey, you like it? All right.

1360
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,834
Come here, girl.

1361
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,792
You are fantastic.

1362
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:45,055
Uh.

It looks great.

Thank you.

1365
01:04:47,666 --> 01:04:48,580
For what?

1366
01:04:48,623 --> 01:04:50,016
For all this.

1367
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:51,670
Girl, thank you.

1368
01:04:51,713 --> 01:04:53,715
Listen, I made reservations for
us at your favorite restaurant

1369
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,629

1370
01:04:54,673 --> 01:04:55,500
Excuse me, Tony.

1371
01:04:55,543 --> 01:04:56,544
We're ready, Lenore.

1372
01:04:56,588 --> 01:04:57,937
You set? - Uh-huh.

1373
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:58,503

01:04:59,678 --> 01:05:01,854
So I'll check you later, all
right?

OK, bye.

Do your thing.

1379
01:05:07,164 --> 01:05:08,469
Is she everything I told you
about, bro?

1380
01:05:08,513 --> 01:05:09,470
- Yes. - All right.

1381
01:05:09,514 --> 01:05:10,384
Can we do this?

1382
01:05:10,428 --> 01:05:11,646
Yo, roll playback.

1383
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:18,001
You've got an amazing way with
women.

Uh-huh.

1385
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:22,092
I think you had too many.

1386
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:23,093
I can't believe--

1387
01:05:35,888 --> 01:05:37,324
Oh, what time is it?

1388

So did I.

1391
01:05:46,551 --> 01:05:50,076
I just can't believe all this
is happening to me.

1392
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,078
Don't be surprised.

1393
01:05:52,122 --> 01:05:53,166

What do you mean don't do this?

1435
01:08:30,497 --> 01:08:33,196
How about, don't take care of
you anymore, huh?

1436
01:08:33,239 --> 01:08:35,894
How about, don't buy Billy any
more clothes?

1444
01:09:07,186 --> 01:09:10,494
Hurt me?

1445
01:09:10,537 --> 01:09:13,061
You can't hurt me.

1446
01:09:13,105 --> 01:09:15,934
I made you.

1447
01:09:15,977 --> 01:09:23,507
Dollar Bill, I don't need you.

1448
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:26,162
You need me.

1449
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:28,425
Just get out of my house.

1450
01:09:28,468 --> 01:09:30,644
So what are you waiting on?

1451
01:09:30,688 --> 01:09:32,211
Get your stuff and get out of my
house.

1452
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:33,734
Get out of my house!

1453
01:09:47,008 --> 01:09:48,227
ASSISTANT: Bill, you can't go in
there.

1454
01:09:48,271 --> 01:09:49,359
He's busy.

1455
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:52,927
I'm-- I'm telling you, you can't
go in.

1456
01:09:52,971 --> 01:09:55,234
He's not gonna see you right
now, Billy.

1457
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:56,757
You've gotta wait. - Get off me.

1458
01:09:56,801 --> 01:09:57,976
Come on.

1459
01:09:58,019 --> 01:09:58,542
If they wanna play hard, we can
play hard.

1460
01:09:58,585 --> 01:09:59,630
Billy!

1461
01:09:59,673 --> 01:10:00,631
I mean, that's not even my
concern.

1462
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:04,417
Excuse me.

1463
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:05,505
I need to talk to you.

1464
01:10:05,549 --> 01:10:06,419
I'll call you back.

1465
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:11,511
What can I do for you, Billy?

1466
01:10:11,555 --> 01:10:12,904
Well, I ain't gonna beat around
the bush with you.

1467
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:14,993
I want out of this contract.

1468
01:10:15,036 --> 01:10:16,473
Why?

1469
01:10:16,516 --> 01:10:20,433
Somebody offer you a better
deal?

1470
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:21,565
No, that's not it.

1471
01:10:21,608 --> 01:10:23,131
I'm just not feeling this music
anymore.

1472
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:26,047
So any money that I owe you,
I'll pay you back.

1473
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:28,267
But I'm through.

1474
01:10:28,311 --> 01:10:30,269
Have you been drinking?

1475
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:32,532
No, actually, actually I
haven't been drinking.

1476
01:10:32,576 --> 01:10:35,753
Actually, it's the first time
I've been sober in months.

1477
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:38,538
So I'm tired of this business.

1478
01:10:38,582 --> 01:10:39,496
I want out of it.

1479
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:45,066
You should've thought about
that before

1480
01:10:45,110 --> 01:10:46,285
you signed a two-album deal.

1481
01:10:46,329 --> 01:10:47,721
Why?

1482
01:10:47,765 --> 01:10:49,288
I've heard you all talking about
dropping me anyway.

1483
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:50,202
You should be happy.

1484
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:57,296
Let me explain something to
you.

1485
01:10:57,340 --> 01:11:00,081
You signed a contract, which
means I own

1486
01:11:00,125 --> 01:11:02,606
you until I get those records.

1487
01:11:02,649 --> 01:11:05,043
You're kind of like my bitch.

1488
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:06,697
And if you try and breach this
contract,

1489
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:10,309
you will be my bitch for the
rest of your life

1490
01:11:10,353 --> 01:11:14,182
until you pay me back every
nickel I invested in you.

1491
01:11:14,226 --> 01:11:17,011
I understand you're having a
rough time.

1492
01:11:17,055 --> 01:11:19,492
I'll give you today off.

1493
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:25,019
But I will see you in the studio
tomorrow.

1494
01:11:25,063 --> 01:11:26,673
Now, get the hell outta here.

1495
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:59,837
Get ready, guys. Line up here.

1496
01:11:59,880 --> 01:12:01,142
REPORTER 1: Hey, Rachel, over
here.

1497
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:02,056
Over here.

1498
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,059
She's coming out in two minutes.

1499
01:12:05,103 --> 01:12:06,017
Get a picture.

1500
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,542
[CHATTER]

1501
01:12:15,418 --> 01:12:16,288
Billy.

1502
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:18,682
BILLY: Hey, congratulations.

1503
01:12:18,725 --> 01:12:20,161
Hey, Billy.

1504
01:12:20,205 --> 01:12:21,075
Hey.

1505
01:12:21,119 --> 01:12:22,599
What a surprise.

1506
01:12:22,642 --> 01:12:23,817
Yeah.

1507
01:12:23,861 --> 01:12:24,818
How are you?

1508
01:12:24,862 --> 01:12:25,689
I'm all right.

1509
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:26,646
I'm really proud of you.

1510
01:12:26,690 --> 01:12:28,648
But, I mean, can we talk?

1511
01:12:28,692 --> 01:12:29,867
You got a second to talk?

1512
01:12:33,523 --> 01:12:34,959
Who's your friend?

1513
01:12:35,002 --> 01:12:37,744
Um, Tony, this is Billy Dixon.

1514
01:12:37,788 --> 01:12:39,529
Sup, bro?

1515
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:40,617
Why do you look so familiar?

1516
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:43,271
Um, Billy's in the business,
too.

1517
01:12:43,315 --> 01:12:44,272
Yeah, Dixon.

1518
01:12:47,188 --> 01:12:50,017
Oh, OK, this is your friend that
had the little pop

1519
01:12:50,061 --> 01:12:52,019
hit with Victoria, right?

1520
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:54,457
It was cute.

1521
01:12:54,500 --> 01:12:57,503
You know, Lenore's single is
number five with a bullet.

1522
01:12:57,547 --> 01:13:00,550
Yeah, I came to congratulate
her.

1523
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:02,595
We're expecting big things from
her.

1524
01:13:02,639 --> 01:13:04,597
She seems like an angel.

1525
01:13:04,641 --> 01:13:06,469
Yeah.

1526
01:13:06,512 --> 01:13:08,862
Yeah.

1527
01:13:08,906 --> 01:13:11,299
Well, anyway, Billy, right?

1528
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:12,213
BILLY: Yeah.

1529
01:13:12,257 --> 01:13:13,345
It was nice to meet you, man.

1530
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:14,259
BILLY: OK.

1531
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:15,434
We gotta go, baby, all right?

1532
01:13:15,478 --> 01:13:16,653
Good to see you, Billy.

1533
01:13:16,696 --> 01:13:18,306
Hey, but wait a second, Lenore.

1534
01:13:18,350 --> 01:13:21,875
But listen, Lenore, let me talk
to you for a second.

1535
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,746
Lenore!

1536
01:13:22,789 --> 01:13:23,703
REPORTER 2: Give us a smile.

1537
01:13:23,747 --> 01:13:25,270
Give us a smile. - Thanks a lot.

1538
01:13:25,313 --> 01:13:26,576
REPORTER 1: Lenore!

1539
01:13:26,619 --> 01:13:27,403
REPORTER 2: Hey, come here, just
one question.

1540
01:13:27,446 --> 01:13:28,491
Just one question, please.

1541
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,493
Just one question Hello, Ms.
Foxwood.

1542
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,016
Hello?

1543
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:33,713
Just one question. REPORTER 1:
This way.

1544
01:13:33,757 --> 01:13:34,627
Come on.

1545
01:13:34,671 --> 01:13:36,412
Come on.

1546
01:13:36,455 --> 01:13:37,325
Lenore.

1547
01:13:37,369 --> 01:13:38,283
Lenore.

1548
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:45,421
So that was Billy, huh?

1549
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:53,385
The brother's in bad shape, one
hit wonder.

1550
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,519
But you, see, you're the real
thing.

1551
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:57,476
Know what I'm saying?

1552
01:14:00,523 --> 01:14:01,480
Lenore?

1553
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:03,134
Hello?

1554
01:14:03,177 --> 01:14:04,004
What?

1555
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:06,616
What's the matter?

1556
01:14:06,659 --> 01:14:08,052
Nothing.

1557
01:14:08,095 --> 01:14:10,837
I'm sorry, just seeing Billy
just really threw me.

1558
01:14:14,624 --> 01:14:16,495
Listen, don't sweat that,
aight?

1559
01:14:16,539 --> 01:14:18,018
Tonight's your night.

1560
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:19,759
We should be celebrating, you
know what I'm saying?

1561
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:28,725
You look so beautiful tonight,
you know that?

1562
01:14:28,768 --> 01:14:29,682
Just gorgeous.

1563
01:14:40,388 --> 01:14:41,999
Tony.

1564
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:43,566
What?

1565
01:14:43,609 --> 01:14:45,219
I mean, it is over between you
two, right?

1566
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:50,877
Yeah, Tony.

1567
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:51,791
Why?

1568
01:14:51,835 --> 01:14:53,227
What do you mean why?

1569
01:14:53,271 --> 01:14:56,274
Because a brother's been putting
in work, that's why.

1570
01:14:56,317 --> 01:14:57,667
Ain't it obvious?

1571
01:14:57,710 --> 01:15:00,278
What's that supposed to mean?

1572
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:03,455
It means I'm checking for you,
Lenore.

1573
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:06,023
I'm trying to get what you,
understand?

1574
01:15:06,066 --> 01:15:07,894
I mean what do a brother gotta
do?

1575
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:23,214
Anyway, um, I put together this
little tour.

1576
01:15:23,257 --> 01:15:25,042
I'm going out on the road with
some of my other bands.

1577
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:29,786
I think you should go.

1578
01:15:29,829 --> 01:15:31,091
I think it'll be good for your
single.

1579
01:15:37,010 --> 01:15:39,317
Think so?

1580
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,537
Yep.

1581
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:46,542
So, um, when do we leave?

1582
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:48,021
Day after tomorrow.

1583
01:15:48,065 --> 01:15:49,370
Day after tomorrow?

1584
01:15:49,414 --> 01:15:51,590
Day after tomorrow.

1585
01:15:51,634 --> 01:15:52,852
It's up to you.

1586
01:15:52,896 --> 01:15:55,246
Just think about it, aight?

1587
01:15:55,289 --> 01:15:56,203
That's all I ask.

1588
01:16:03,689 --> 01:16:05,256
I let the label whip me.

1589
01:16:05,299 --> 01:16:08,607
You gonna let the label do it
all, huh, control your life?

1590
01:16:08,651 --> 01:16:10,566
So you new money in this, homie.

1591
01:16:10,609 --> 01:16:11,479
You know what I mean?

1592
01:16:11,523 --> 01:16:12,829
I done been in this for years.

1593
01:16:12,872 --> 01:16:14,482
I could tell you from the door,
you

1594
01:16:14,526 --> 01:16:16,615
wanna know the whole little
industry here ain't

1595
01:16:16,659 --> 01:16:18,574
nothing but snakes and rats.

1596
01:16:18,617 --> 01:16:20,271
When you talking about your
family,

1597
01:16:20,314 --> 01:16:22,621
that's supposed to always come
first.

1598
01:16:22,665 --> 01:16:24,231
See, I got a wifey at home, man.

1599
01:16:24,275 --> 01:16:26,016
I completed my circle.

1600
01:16:26,059 --> 01:16:28,540
It wasn't complete until I did.

1601
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,977
The whole point you gotta
realize, if you in the projects

1602
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:34,502
and you throw cheese on the
floor, what's gonna come out?

1603
01:16:34,546 --> 01:16:35,895
Rats.

1604
01:16:35,939 --> 01:16:38,202
Before you have money, you ain't
seen none of that.

1605
01:16:38,245 --> 01:16:40,334
You had your lady home, you was
happy.

1606
01:16:40,378 --> 01:16:42,423
Soon as you got cheese, what you
get?

1607
01:16:42,467 --> 01:16:43,337
Rats.

1608
01:16:43,381 --> 01:16:44,208
Rats, rats.

1609
01:16:44,251 --> 01:16:45,644
You know what I mean?

1610
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:49,648
What you need to do, you need to
handle your business

1611
01:16:49,692 --> 01:16:52,869
and go home and deal with wifey
and stop

1612
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:54,044
rolling with the rollers.

1613
01:16:59,527 --> 01:17:03,488
Come on, Lenore, are your eyes
closed?

1614
01:17:03,531 --> 01:17:06,491
Because I do not trust you.

1615
01:17:06,534 --> 01:17:11,061
And if you open them, you're
going to mess up the surprise.

1616
01:17:11,104 --> 01:17:13,280
We're almost there, little girl.

1617
01:17:13,324 --> 01:17:14,934
We're almost-- ah!

1618
01:17:14,978 --> 01:17:16,457
Little girl.

1619
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:17,633
OK, open your eyes.

1620

Oh, it's beautiful.

1623
01:17:38,044 --> 01:17:40,786
When you promised me your love
eternal,

1624
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,789
you said that we'd never part.

1625

I can't do this.

1654

I just said I wanna open up
communication with you.

1655

I can't.

1660
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:24,281
All the last few years have
just

1661
01:19:24,324 --> 01:19:28,546
been for absolutely nothing.

1662
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:32,942
I didn't sleep with him, but
nothing really happened.

1663

No, what happened?

Well, that's good.

01:19:44,823 --> 01:19:45,693
I'm sorry.

1671
01:19:45,737 --> 01:19:47,652
That's good.

I don't feel that no more.

1679
01:20:11,937 --> 01:20:15,332
I never felt that when we
stopped.

1680
01:20:15,375 --> 01:20:19,858
When all of this was going on,
I kind of found out

But, uh, I guess it wasn't
meant to be.

1684
01:20:33,872 --> 01:20:35,700

didn't tell me?
