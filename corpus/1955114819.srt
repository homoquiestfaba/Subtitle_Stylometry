1
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,986
<i>Are we rolling?</i>

2
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:43,119
<i>Okay, we're rolling.</i>

3
00:00:43,152 --> 00:00:45,286
<i>Dave's birthday message,
take 1.</i>

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,420
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!</i>

5
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:49,784
<i>We know how hard you've been
working on Ashley's album...</i>

6
00:00:49,819 --> 00:00:51,151
<i>so we thought it would be fun</i>

7
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,985
<i>to surprise you
with a little party.</i>

8
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,754
<i>Hey! I thought you said this
was a going-away party for us.</i>

9
00:00:57,986 --> 00:00:59,119
<i>Take 2.</i>

10
00:00:59,154 --> 00:01:00,685
<i>To celebrate your birthday...</i>

11
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:03,620
<i>and The Chipettes leaving to
guest-judge American Idol...</i>

12
00:01:03,654 --> 00:01:05,952
<i>we thought we'd throw you
a small get...</i>

13
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:07,053
<i>Hold on, that's the DJ!</i>

14
00:01:07,085 --> 00:01:09,319
<i>Wait, "DJ"?</i>

15
00:01:09,353 --> 00:01:13,886
<i>Okay, fine, so it might be
a medium-sized get-together.</i>

16
00:01:13,919 --> 00:01:15,853
Alvin, did you
hire someone to build

17
00:01:15,886 --> 00:01:17,787
a half-pipe in the back yard?

18
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,120
Of course not!
The party planner did.

19
00:01:20,154 --> 00:01:21,852
You hired a party planner?

20
00:01:21,887 --> 00:01:24,420
No, he did not hire
a "party planner."

21
00:01:24,453 --> 00:01:25,785
Thank goodness.
For a minute there, I...

22
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,019
I am an event planner.

23
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:29,685
Marco, I'm done
giving you instructions.

24
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,253
Boy.

25
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:34,053
<i>Dave, it's all good.
It's just us.</i>

26
00:01:34,086 --> 00:01:36,285
<i>Nothing too cra...</i>

27
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:38,519
<i>Theodore!
You hit the flip button!</i>

28
00:01:38,552 --> 00:01:41,118
<i>Hi.</i>

29
00:01:41,154 --> 00:01:44,187
So, the guest list got
a little out of hand.

30
00:01:44,653 --> 00:01:46,052
A little?

31
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:47,252
<i>Dave, I had nothing
to do with this!</i>

32
00:01:47,287 --> 00:01:50,653
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!
Whoo-hoo!</i>

33
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,421
Redfoo is here?

34
00:01:52,454 --> 00:01:54,386
<i>Yeah, he is,
because I got him here.</i>

35
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,620
<i>The Redfoo, from a little band
called The Foo Fighters.</i>

36
00:01:57,653 --> 00:01:59,220
<i>What?</i>

37
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:01,120
<i>Well, there's no way
to sugarcoat it, Dave.</i>

38
00:02:01,153 --> 00:02:02,319
<i>The cops are here!..</i>

39
00:02:02,354 --> 00:02:03,719
<i>And they're having a blast!</i>

40
00:02:03,754 --> 00:02:04,754
<i>Happy Birthday, Dave!</i>

41
00:02:06,087 --> 00:02:07,753
This does wonders
for my glutes!

42
00:02:07,787 --> 00:02:10,052
This party is the least
we can do for you, Dave.

43
00:02:10,087 --> 00:02:11,987
<i>Yeah! Giving up
songwriting to produce?</i>

44
00:02:12,019 --> 00:02:13,451
<i>Buying a new house?</i>

45
00:02:13,487 --> 00:02:15,620
<i>We know you've done
all of this for us.</i>

46
00:02:15,654 --> 00:02:17,086
<i>We love you, Dave!</i>

47
00:02:21,287 --> 00:02:22,920
<i>Happy Birthday, Dwayne.</i>

48
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:24,821
<i>It's Dave!</i>

49
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:34,921
I got 40 cheese pizzas here
for a, Theodore.

50
00:02:34,953 --> 00:02:37,022
Whoo-hoo! Pay the man, Si.

51
00:02:38,355 --> 00:02:39,287
Whoo!

52
00:02:40,422 --> 00:02:41,687
Redfoo!

53
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:44,152
<i>You ready to rock this party
with a little Party Rock?</i>

54
00:02:44,188 --> 00:02:46,188
You like the classics.

55
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,122
<i>But I got a new one for you,
Juicy Wiggle!</i>

56
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,755
This is my jizz-am!

57
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,456
Cool!

58
00:02:59,255 --> 00:03:01,054
<i># I walked into the party</i>

59
00:03:02,254 --> 00:03:04,453
<i># I seen somethin' I never saw</i>

60
00:03:05,987 --> 00:03:08,721
<i># Everybody was movin',
groovin'</i>

61
00:03:08,754 --> 00:03:11,154
<i># Girls, they were
dancin' on the bar</i>

62
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:16,452
<i># Now this wasn't
no ordinary dance</i>

63
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:20,419
<i># Hey, man, why is everybody
swimmin' in a trance?</i>

64
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:24,022
<i># I couldn't figure it out
like your grandpa's riddle</i>

65
00:03:24,056 --> 00:03:25,955
<i># I asked 'em what they doin'
and they said...</i>

66
00:03:25,988 --> 00:03:27,056
<i># Juicy wiggle!</i>

67
00:03:29,455 --> 00:03:31,088
<i># Now move your hips
and dance like fish</i>

68
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,089
<i># Get juicy</i>

69
00:03:38,422 --> 00:03:39,322
<i># Get juicy</i>

70
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:43,122
<i># Yeah, get juicy</i>

71
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:47,789
<i># Get juicy</i>

72
00:03:48,756 --> 00:03:49,589
<i># Get juicy</i>

73
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:51,454
<i># Get juicy</i>

74
00:03:52,423 --> 00:03:53,722
<i># Get juicy!</i>

75
00:03:53,756 --> 00:03:55,187
<i># Two girls was shakin' it</i>

76
00:03:55,221 --> 00:03:56,421
<i># I jumped in the middle</i>

77
00:03:57,522 --> 00:03:59,356
<i># I asked 'em what we doin'
and they said...</i>

78
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,623
<i># Juicy Wiggle!</i>

79
00:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,088
<i># Get juicy</i>

80
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,855
Yeah! I'm in.

81
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,023
Show 'em what you got, Theo!

82
00:04:18,322 --> 00:04:19,224
Whoo-hoo!

83
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,656
<i># Get juicy</i>

84
00:04:21,923 --> 00:04:23,855
He's so smooth.

85
00:04:23,889 --> 00:04:24,956
<i># Yeah, get juicy</i>

86
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,490
Whoo! Yeah!

87
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:31,187
Whoo-whee!

88
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:33,756
<i># Now I done
just lost my mind</i>

89
00:04:34,391 --> 00:04:35,623
Is that safe?

90
00:04:35,656 --> 00:04:37,591
No, it is absolutely not.

91
00:04:41,256 --> 00:04:42,354
What the...

92
00:04:43,755 --> 00:04:46,888
Excuse me, young lady?
The launch ramp is closed.

93
00:04:46,922 --> 00:04:48,223
Hey, Simon's gonna go!

94
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,555
No, no, no, I'm not going.

95
00:04:51,589 --> 00:04:53,489
I was just explaining
that this is really...

96
00:04:53,524 --> 00:04:54,857
High!

97
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:01,655
That was awesome!
I'm definitely going again.

98
00:05:02,989 --> 00:05:04,489
Boys.

99
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:06,791
Whoo!

100
00:05:09,756 --> 00:05:11,023
<i># Get juicy #</i>

101
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,255
When I say "Party,"
you say "Alvin!"

102
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:14,356
Party!

103
00:05:14,357 --> 00:05:15,423
Alvin!

104
00:05:15,457 --> 00:05:17,022
-Party!
-Alvin!

105
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:17,990
Party!

106
00:05:18,022 --> 00:05:19,623
Alvin!

107
00:05:22,058 --> 00:05:24,057
Surprise?

108
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,125
Whoo-hoo!

109
00:05:27,358 --> 00:05:28,756
Boy.

110
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:32,124
If anyone needs us,

111
00:05:32,158 --> 00:05:34,523
we'll just be...
Across the country.

112
00:05:35,689 --> 00:05:37,590
Over there, come on.
Party's over.

113
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,325
Thank you.
Yeah, that's mine.

114
00:05:41,124 --> 00:05:42,023
You had to grab
one last one?

115
00:05:42,057 --> 00:05:43,124
-Yeah.
-Okay.

116
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,157
Enjoy that, yeah.

117
00:05:45,657 --> 00:05:47,222
Were you surprised?

118
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:50,123
No, I wasn't surprised,
and you wanna know why?

119
00:05:50,157 --> 00:05:53,057
Because #Davesparty
was trending on Twitter.

120
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:54,225
Nice!

121
00:05:55,024 --> 00:05:57,092
I mean, sorry.

122
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,825
I know my work schedule
is tough...

123
00:05:58,859 --> 00:05:59,924
but I thought you guys
were old enough

124
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,323
to take care of yourselves.

125
00:06:01,357 --> 00:06:02,957
But I guess you're
not mature enough for that.

126
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:05,522
That's insulting.
We are very mature.

127
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,290
Sorry.
Pizza toots.

128
00:06:10,591 --> 00:06:12,624
Look, I'm trying to start
a new chapter in my life.

129
00:06:12,658 --> 00:06:14,091
A more stable chapter...

130
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,289
where you guys
aren't performing

131
00:06:15,324 --> 00:06:17,024
in a different city
every night.

132
00:06:17,059 --> 00:06:18,358
But, we love to perform.

133
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:21,457
You can go back to that,
just not now, okay?

134
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:23,057
I want you guys
to have a few years

135
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:24,024
of being normal kids.

136
00:06:24,757 --> 00:06:25,791
But we're not
normal kids, Dave.

137
00:06:25,824 --> 00:06:27,390
Yeah...

138
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:29,690
we're multi-platinum
singing chipmunks!

139
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:31,023
Well, right now,

140
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,690
you're acting like
a bunch of animals...

141
00:06:32,724 --> 00:06:36,889
who just threw a giant house
party without my permission.

142
00:06:36,924 --> 00:06:39,724
Does this mean
no miniature golf tomorrow?

143
00:06:39,758 --> 00:06:41,558
It should, and normally,
it would.

144
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,357
But, you're gonna give us
one last chance, right?

145
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:48,258
I think he means
our 158th last chance?

146
00:06:48,292 --> 00:06:49,924
Look, selfishly,
I wanna spend as much time

147
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,358
with you guys as I can...

148
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,856
before I have to go to Ashley's
album release in Miami.

149
00:06:53,892 --> 00:06:57,125
Whoo-hoo!
We're going to Miami!

150
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:58,623
<i># Come on, shake
your body, baby, do the conga</i>

151
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,793
<i># I know you can't control
yourself any longer</i>

152
00:07:00,825 --> 00:07:03,092
<i># Feel the rhythm of the music
getting stronger #</i>

153
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,092
Theodore, get our
Speedos! Yeah!

154
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:06,657
No, no Speedos.

155
00:07:06,692 --> 00:07:07,891
I'm going to Miami.

156
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,258
I only got a plus one,

157
00:07:09,292 --> 00:07:10,992
so it wouldn't be fair
to pick favorites.

158
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:14,825
We both know
I'm your favorite.

159
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,958
Alvin.

160
00:07:15,992 --> 00:07:17,558
Tied for favorite?

161
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:19,591
You don't even have
to say with who.

162
00:07:19,626 --> 00:07:21,792
Blink once for Theodore,
twice for Simon.

163
00:07:22,925 --> 00:07:24,758
Got it, no favorites.

164
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,626
Wind, 35 degrees,
out of the northwest.

165
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:40,292
Okay, tail up.
10, 10 degrees down.

166
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:41,893
Shoulders up,
shoulders down.

167
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:43,192
Shoulders to the left,
shoulders to the right.

168
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:44,692
Tail in, tail out.

169
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:45,891
While
we're young, Simon.

170
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:46,992
Loosen the grip,
loosen the grip.

171
00:07:47,026 --> 00:07:48,093
Not too loose,
not too loose, Simon.

172
00:07:48,125 --> 00:07:49,892
-Any day, now.
-And...

173
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,260
My concentration
is broken.

174
00:07:51,293 --> 00:07:53,193
-Now I have to start all over.
-Great!

175
00:07:53,228 --> 00:07:54,127
Let's start this
charade again.

176
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,293
Come on!

177
00:07:55,327 --> 00:07:57,425
This isn't the
PGA Tour, Simon.

178
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:00,392
Exactly. But this
is what it's all about.

179
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,358
Just 4 dudes
playing some golf.

180
00:08:02,392 --> 00:08:04,192
Actually, that
reminds me...

181
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:05,992
I invited a friend to join us.

182
00:08:06,026 --> 00:08:07,993
Is this
the famous Samantha

183
00:08:08,026 --> 00:08:09,591
we've been hearing
so much about?

184
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,493
-It is.
-David!

185
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:13,391
La la.

186
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:17,458
<i># Dave and Samantha
sittin' in a tree... #</i>

187
00:08:17,492 --> 00:08:19,326
Very funny, guys.

188
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,092
Anyway, it's starting to feel
kind of serious, so...

189
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,193
I thought an introduction
would be nice.

190
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:26,326
You must really
like this girl, Dave.

191
00:08:26,359 --> 00:08:28,326
I do, and I hope
you guys do, too.

192
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,359
Yeah. Any girlfriend of yours
is a girlfriend of ours.

193
00:08:32,659 --> 00:08:34,794
That sounded way less
weird in my head.

194
00:08:34,827 --> 00:08:36,159
You think?

195
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:37,559
She's here.

196
00:08:38,093 --> 00:08:39,392
How do I look?

197
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,059
Well...

198
00:08:41,092 --> 00:08:43,392
You know? Looks.

199
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:45,792
Alvin! This is no time
for honesty.

200
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:47,460
You look great, Dave.

201
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:50,560
That sweater makes you look
like a cozy grandpa.

202
00:08:50,592 --> 00:08:51,626
Thanks, Theodore.

203
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:55,059
Okay, where was I?
Shoulders up, shoulders down.

204
00:08:55,094 --> 00:08:57,493
Brother.
Hit the ball, already!

205
00:08:57,527 --> 00:08:58,427
Okay!

206
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:01,094
Look at it soar!

207
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:02,660
Follow me, come on guys!

208
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:03,727
Wow.

209
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,025
Awesome!

210
00:09:05,061 --> 00:09:06,128
Come on!

211
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,494
Follow the ball!
Through the mouth!

212
00:09:09,527 --> 00:09:11,393
Open wide!
Whoo-hoo!

213
00:09:11,427 --> 00:09:12,327
Hurry up!

214
00:09:13,795 --> 00:09:15,027
Hurry, Theodore!

215
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:16,095
I'm going as fast as I can!

216
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,294
Turn, turn!

217
00:09:17,327 --> 00:09:18,693
My wind calculations
were accurate!

218
00:09:19,161 --> 00:09:20,392
Come on, guys!

219
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:21,526
My gosh! My gosh!

220
00:09:22,027 --> 00:09:23,228
It's a hole-in...

221
00:09:23,261 --> 00:09:26,428
No! Why?

222
00:09:26,462 --> 00:09:28,695
Excuse me, that's
my brother's ball.

223
00:09:28,728 --> 00:09:30,695
This ball?

224
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:32,127
No, no, this is my ball.

225
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,126
What? I just hit
that beautiful shot.

226
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,392
Tell you what,
let's compromise,

227
00:09:35,427 --> 00:09:37,594
and we'll call it...
no one's ball.

228
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:39,193
Hey!

229
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:40,626
I'm warning you.

230
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,992
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

231
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,359
-Yeah!
-Aw.

232
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:45,428
I'm terrified.

233
00:09:47,626 --> 00:09:48,760
What, what? Ouch! Wait!

234
00:09:48,793 --> 00:09:50,160
What are you gonna do?

235
00:09:50,194 --> 00:09:53,027
We will continue this
conversation when I'm back.

236
00:09:53,794 --> 00:09:54,892
Hey, dude,
it's your turn.

237
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,393
Yeah.

238
00:09:56,427 --> 00:09:58,028
Whatever! I don't
even need that ball!

239
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,427
Si's right,
you're not worth it!

240
00:10:00,461 --> 00:10:01,428
Yeah!

241
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:03,961
Dave,
thank goodness.

242
00:10:03,994 --> 00:10:05,193
Hey, Dave.

243
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,328
Hey, guys.
This is Samantha.

244
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,460
Sam, these are my boys.

245
00:10:08,461 --> 00:10:09,560
Hi.

246
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:10,993
-Hi.
-That's Theodore.

247
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,128
He might be the smallest,

248
00:10:12,162 --> 00:10:12,961
but he's got
the biggest heart.

249
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:14,393
Hi.

250
00:10:14,427 --> 00:10:15,594
We've heard
a lot about you.

251
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,193
<i>Enchante.</i>

252
00:10:19,628 --> 00:10:22,361
I can tell
that you're trouble.

253
00:10:22,396 --> 00:10:24,961
If by "trouble,"
you mean "irresistible,"

254
00:10:24,994 --> 00:10:26,960
then guilty as charged.

255
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:29,293
Alvin, of course.
And there's Simon.

256
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,428
So, you're a doctor?

257
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:31,661
I am.

258
00:10:31,694 --> 00:10:32,994
Did Dave mention that?

259
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,462
No, you're
wearing a stethoscope.

260
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:40,128
Yes, I am.
That's embarrassing.

261
00:10:40,162 --> 00:10:41,727
Would it
be okay if I tried it?

262
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,061
Yeah, knock yourself out.

263
00:10:43,096 --> 00:10:44,096
Thank you.

264
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:48,228
Heart rate is smooth
and steady, 400 BPM.

265
00:10:48,262 --> 00:10:49,828
So, it's beating?

266
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,395
Of course it's beating.

267
00:10:51,429 --> 00:10:53,628
It's so nice to finally
meet you guys.

268
00:10:53,663 --> 00:10:55,630
And this is
my son, Miles.

269
00:10:56,064 --> 00:10:57,098
Son?

270
00:10:57,099 --> 00:10:58,130
No.

271
00:10:58,163 --> 00:10:59,294
You guys have
a lot in common.

272
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:00,828
Miles is also a musician.

273
00:11:00,862 --> 00:11:01,960
Yeah, I've heard
you're pretty good.

274
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:02,962
Thanks, Mr. Seville.

275
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,495
Brother.

276
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,895
We thought this
was the perfect place

277
00:11:05,929 --> 00:11:07,295
for you guys to get to know
each other better.

278
00:11:07,328 --> 00:11:09,727
Yes, so behave, okay?

279
00:11:09,762 --> 00:11:10,928
And Theo, get down
from there.

280
00:11:10,962 --> 00:11:12,194
I'll get him.

281
00:11:13,395 --> 00:11:16,061
So, back to our conversation.

282
00:11:16,896 --> 00:11:18,062
No hard feelings?

283
00:11:19,961 --> 00:11:21,527
Hey, you guys
having fun?

284
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,527
Yeah, just
getting some cotton candy.

285
00:11:23,562 --> 00:11:24,496
All right.

286
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:29,327
This is not my idea of fun.

287
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:31,761
Yummy.

288
00:11:31,795 --> 00:11:32,562
Theo!

289
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:37,461
Alvin,
where did Theodore go?

290
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,696
I don't know, I haven't
seen him since the last hole.

291
00:11:39,729 --> 00:11:41,195
What do you think?

292
00:11:41,229 --> 00:11:43,628
20 bucks seems like
a lot of money for a chipmunk.

293
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:44,995
He's a talking chipmunk.

294
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,227
Go on, plump and juicy,
say something.

295
00:11:47,262 --> 00:11:48,661
I also sing.

296
00:11:54,164 --> 00:11:56,630
<i># Yeah, yeah, yeah... #</i>

297
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:58,496
This isn't like Theo,
to wander off.

298
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,962
I know.

299
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:00,996
Why don't you
check the river?

300
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:02,063
Chip shot!

301
00:12:02,563 --> 00:12:03,462
Whoa!

302
00:12:04,929 --> 00:12:06,295
Alvin, I found him.

303
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,297
-Give us back our brother!
-Yeah!

304
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,630
I just paid 20 bucks for him.

305
00:12:09,663 --> 00:12:10,597
He's not for sale!

306
00:12:11,563 --> 00:12:13,197
-I want 40.
-What?

307
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,596
He's a talking chipmunk.

308
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:15,895
I also sing.

309
00:12:15,929 --> 00:12:17,731
Theo! You're not helping.

310
00:12:17,764 --> 00:12:20,461
<i># I like big butts
and I cannot lie</i>

311
00:12:20,497 --> 00:12:22,264

Fine!

317
00:12:32,263 --> 00:12:33,763
I hope you're happy,
Theodore.

318
00:12:33,797 --> 00:12:35,397
That was all of our allowance.

319
00:12:35,432 --> 00:12:37,564
Sorry.
I was born to perform.

320
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:38,763
Great news, fellas.

321
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:40,763
You get to hang
with Miles all day.

322
00:12:40,797 --> 00:12:42,931
And the hits
just keep on coming...

323
00:12:42,964 --> 00:12:44,531
Sam got a page
from the hospital,

324
00:12:44,565 --> 00:12:46,498
so I'm going to take you four
to the studio with me.

325
00:12:46,531 --> 00:12:47,729
All right, be good.

326
00:12:47,763 --> 00:12:48,896
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, honey.

327
00:12:49,929 --> 00:12:50,429
Don't forget
your stethoscope.

328
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:51,030
Yeah.

329
00:12:51,064 --> 00:12:53,029
-You know what? Keep it.
-Thanks.

330
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:54,663
Break a leg.

331
00:12:54,696 --> 00:12:57,096
That doesn't really apply
to doctors, Dave.

332
00:12:57,463 --> 00:12:58,496
Right.

333
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,130
Good luck!

334
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:01,996
You kind of hope your heart
surgeon doesn't need luck.

335
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,630
Have fun!

336
00:13:05,764 --> 00:13:06,664
Nailed it!

337
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,798
Look, paparazzi.

338
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:24,163
I guess they heard
we were coming.

339
00:13:24,197 --> 00:13:28,096
Hey, guys!
It is good to see you.

340
00:13:28,130 --> 00:13:29,362
Can you get one more
from this side?

341
00:13:29,398 --> 00:13:30,531
Yeah.

342
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:32,065
Guys, they aren't
here for you, come on.

343
00:13:32,632 --> 00:13:34,031

Hey, down here!

-That's my tail!
-Excuse me.

357
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:10,033
First, can you guys apologize
for trampling my friends?

358
00:14:11,732 --> 00:14:13,866
Aw, sorry
about that, guys.

359
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,231
-Thank you, Ashley.
-Sure.

360
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:16,131
Miss Grey, when
are you going back on tour?

361
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:17,165
Miss Grey, over here.

362
00:14:17,198 --> 00:14:18,497
Hey, you know what?

363
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:19,499
Let me,
let me get this for you.

364
00:14:21,033 --> 00:14:23,200
You know,
I think it's "Push."

365
00:14:24,232 --> 00:14:25,531
Yeah,
you know, of course.

366
00:14:26,898 --> 00:14:28,398
Whoa. Okay.

367
00:14:30,331 --> 00:14:34,498
Looks like Mr. Macho isn't
as cool as he thinks he is.

368
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:37,665
<i># Hey! Hello, you know
You're making me love sick</i>

369
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:39,465
<i># You like my dynamite
I'm like tick tick #</i>

370
00:14:39,498 --> 00:14:41,099
Man.

371
00:14:41,133 --> 00:14:43,099
I didn't realize
how boring it is

372
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:44,465
to be on this side
of the glass.

373
00:14:45,498 --> 00:14:47,365
Yeah, why aren't
you guys in there?

374
00:14:47,398 --> 00:14:49,297
I thought you were, like,
super famous or something?

375
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,832
One day, you're throwing back
pink lemonades

376
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:54,498
on Diddy's yacht
in Saint-Tropez...

377
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:56,065
Jackpot!

378
00:14:56,098 --> 00:14:57,898
and the next,
you're eating stale chips

379
00:14:57,932 --> 00:14:59,399
you find in the couch.

380
00:14:59,432 --> 00:15:01,365
I miss it.

381
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,367
Theodore, couch
chips are for talent only.

382
00:15:05,866 --> 00:15:07,833
Really, Barry?

383
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:10,499
All right, you can keep it.
Just don't tell anyone, okay?

384
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:11,732
Whoo-hoo! Yum.

385
00:15:14,732 --> 00:15:16,033
<i>We did it!</i>

386
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:18,399
We successfully introduced
our kids to each other.

387
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,665
And then, you performed
open-heart surgery.

388
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,265
Please, after being
a single mom

389
00:15:22,299 --> 00:15:23,500
and a med student,
I could do this in my sleep.

390
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,366
And I wore my stethoscope
out again, didn't I?

391
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,666
I thought it was cute.

392
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:32,099
And I like people to know
I'm dating a doctor.

393
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,433
All right, I guess my life

394
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,634
is a little more hectic
than I'd like to admit.

395
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,500
I get it.

396
00:15:39,533 --> 00:15:42,533
So, I have to ask.
The boys?

397
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:44,765
Are they, like,
your adopted kids, or...

398
00:15:44,799 --> 00:15:46,166
How does that work?

399
00:15:46,201 --> 00:15:48,134
I don't know, I never really
thought about it.

400
00:15:50,668 --> 00:15:51,601
What?

401
00:15:53,735 --> 00:15:55,099
They're lucky to have you.

402
00:15:58,167 --> 00:15:59,200
Crazy idea.

403
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,432
Have you ever been to Miami?

404
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,532
<i>This is American Idol!</i>

405
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:11,665
<i>I'm sorry
to have to do this...</i>

406
00:16:11,698 --> 00:16:13,366
<i>but you're going to Hollywood!</i>

407
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,532
I've always
wanted to say that!

408
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,133
Why did they get to move out
and do all this cool stuff?

409
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,733
Well, Alvin...

410
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:24,299
girls are
scientifically proven

411
00:16:24,334 --> 00:16:26,033
to mature faster than boys.

412
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,134
Whatever.

413
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:28,932
Hey, guys.

414
00:16:28,966 --> 00:16:30,100
-Dave!
-Hi.

415
00:16:30,134 --> 00:16:31,399
Sorry I'm late.
I had to pick up

416
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:32,599
a few things
on the way home.

417
00:16:32,634 --> 00:16:34,634
No worries,
we've just been ruminating

418
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:36,234
on why we
still live at home.

419
00:16:36,268 --> 00:16:37,868
So, what'd you guys
think of Samantha?

420
00:16:37,902 --> 00:16:38,968
She's awesome.

421
00:16:39,001 --> 00:16:40,367
We loved her.

422
00:16:40,402 --> 00:16:42,633
Leftovers.

423
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't wait.

424
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:50,734
I can taste it.
Yes! Yummy.

425
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:54,201
I can't eat this.

426
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:57,469
Whoa! That is a serious
engagement ring.

427
00:16:57,502 --> 00:16:59,968
Wait a second. That means
Dave is going to ask

428
00:17:00,001 --> 00:17:02,067
Samantha to marry him.

429
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Hold on,
we don't know that.

430
00:17:04,134 --> 00:17:05,835
They've only been together
a few months,

431
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:07,635
so you're probably
overreacting.

432
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:08,435
But what if it's true?

433
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:11,167
Here he comes.

434
00:17:11,201 --> 00:17:12,201
Act casual.

435
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,234
What are you guys doing?

436
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:21,234
Yoga. Downward munk?

437
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:22,335
Well, that's great
to hear that

438
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:24,302
you guys like Samantha,
because...

439
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:25,734
she's gonna become
a big part of my life.

440
00:17:26,468 --> 00:17:27,768
And good news.

441
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:29,936
My plus one
isn't going to waste.

442
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:31,368
She is coming
to Miami with me.

443
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:37,701
I'm standing right here.
I can hear what he's saying.

444
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,133
I've always wanted a mom.

445
00:17:50,168 --> 00:17:51,467
Guys...

446
00:17:51,501 --> 00:17:55,000
if Samantha is our mom,
that makes Miles...

447
00:17:55,034 --> 00:17:56,101
Our brother.

448
00:17:59,535 --> 00:18:00,734
<i>No!</i>

449
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:03,936
Deep breaths, Theodore.
In and out.

450
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,733
It's going to be okay.

451
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:07,101
What are we gonna do?

452
00:18:08,202 --> 00:18:09,868
Guys, it's time.

453
00:18:09,901 --> 00:18:12,701
Operation ring retrieval
is a go.

454
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:14,802
No ring, no proposal.

455
00:18:14,836 --> 00:18:17,169
No proposal, no Miles.

456
00:18:17,203 --> 00:18:18,734
Theo, fall in line, soldier.

457
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:20,202
Brother.

458
00:18:31,203 --> 00:18:33,237
Alvin, what...
Are we doing a charade?

459
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:36,236
Cool. Two words.

460
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,770
No.

461
00:18:38,801 --> 00:18:40,101
First down? What are you...

462
00:18:40,836 --> 00:18:42,935
Two syllables. Sounds like.

463
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:44,086
Is it a movie?
First word.

464
00:18:44,087 --> 00:18:45,202
A song?

465
00:18:45,235 --> 00:18:46,367
-Angry.
-Get over here.

466
00:18:46,403 --> 00:18:47,536
Okay.

467
00:18:47,569 --> 00:18:49,369
Still no idea
what you're saying.

468
00:18:49,403 --> 00:18:51,203
Theodore, you keep
an eye on Dave.

469
00:18:51,237 --> 00:18:52,771
Simon and I
will get the ring.

470
00:19:01,136 --> 00:19:02,770
There you are.

471
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,037
Alvin, grab this.

472
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,301
Let's do this.

473
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:25,634
Yes!

474
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,637
-The bag's gone.
-No.

475
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,268
You mean that bag over there?

476
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:31,568
And I'm back to "Yes."

477
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,737
And right back to "No."

478
00:19:33,769 --> 00:19:35,269
Abort. Abort. Let's go.

479
00:19:39,769 --> 00:19:40,703
Guys...

480
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,204
what are you doing in here?

481
00:19:43,237 --> 00:19:46,270
Well... We...

482
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,437
just wanted to spend
as much time as possible

483
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:50,568
with you before
you left for Miami.

484
00:19:50,603 --> 00:19:51,902
Yeah.

485
00:19:51,936 --> 00:19:53,803
All right.
I'll make breakfast.

486
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:55,570
Whoo-hoo! I love breakfast.

487
00:19:55,971 --> 00:19:57,770
Alvin, grab it.

488
00:19:57,804 --> 00:20:01,302
Belgian waffles,
pancakes. So excited.

489
00:20:12,803 --> 00:20:14,469
Okay, guys...

490
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:16,704
Miss Price from next door,
she's gonna peek in on you...

491
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:17,902
make sure you're all right.

492
00:20:17,937 --> 00:20:19,638
What? She's nuts.

493
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,270
We should be the ones
checking in on her.

494
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,138
Well, after that big party
you guys threw...

495
00:20:24,171 --> 00:20:25,637
I don't feel very comfortable
with you guys

496
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,470
staying here unsupervised.
You got it?

497
00:20:28,638 --> 00:20:29,904
That must be
Samantha and Miles.

498
00:20:31,005 --> 00:20:32,604
Miles?

499
00:20:32,638 --> 00:20:34,570
Yeah, he's going to stay
with you guys for a few days.

500
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:37,671
So, you don't feel comfortable
leaving us alone,

501
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:40,204
but you're okay leaving us
with that psychopath?

502
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,071
No, he's a great kid.

503
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,238
It'll be fun.

504
00:20:43,272 --> 00:20:44,905
You know, it'll be,

505
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:47,005
a good bonding experience
for you guys.

506
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,405
I'm pretty sure
Miles would interpret

507
00:20:49,438 --> 00:20:51,736
"bonding experience"
as super-gluing us together.

508
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:53,803
Hi.

509
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,002
Wow. Great place.

510
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:56,604
Thanks.

511
00:20:56,636 --> 00:20:58,003
Make yourself at home.

512
00:20:58,038 --> 00:20:59,238
<i>Mi casa, su casa.</i>

513
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:06,105
Wow. That's really impressive.

514
00:21:06,138 --> 00:21:07,704
I actually don't
speak Spanish.

515
00:21:07,738 --> 00:21:09,136
He said that it's
very generous

516
00:21:09,171 --> 00:21:10,072
of you to open your home.

517
00:21:23,337 --> 00:21:25,738
All right. I guess this is it.
Have a great weekend, guys.

518
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:27,171
And boys...

519
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:29,237
try to show me you can handle
some independence, okay?

520
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:30,337
All right, bye, sweetie.
Be good.

521
00:21:30,371 --> 00:21:31,339
Okay.

522
00:21:32,605 --> 00:21:34,537
All right. Here we go.

523
00:21:34,573 --> 00:21:36,373
I can feel the bonding
happening already.

524
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,805
We're gonna be doing
tons of bonding.

525
00:21:41,904 --> 00:21:43,537
Where's the Super Glue?

526
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:48,637
Miles, if we're going
to make this work,

527
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,006
we need to talk.

528
00:21:50,038 --> 00:21:51,504
Feels like it's working.

529
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:53,105
But, good talk.

530
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:55,206
You can't shut us
out forever.

531
00:21:55,239 --> 00:21:56,871
He means emotionally, but...

532
00:21:56,906 --> 00:21:58,304
I want to focus
on the physically

533
00:21:58,339 --> 00:21:59,939
shutting us out
of our own home part.

534
00:21:59,971 --> 00:22:01,271
I have to pee.

535
00:22:01,305 --> 00:22:02,771
You guys are so naive.

536
00:22:02,806 --> 00:22:05,006
Trust me, this thing with
Dave and my mom is temporary.

537
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,072
If by temporary you mean,
"till death do they part"...

538
00:22:08,106 --> 00:22:09,439
then yeah.
Totally temporary.

539
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:11,305
What are you talking about?

540
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:13,373
He's talking
about marriage, Miles.

541
00:22:13,407 --> 00:22:14,906
Wedding bells.

542
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:17,439
Dave liked it and he's
gonna put a ring on it.

543
00:22:21,072 --> 00:22:22,506
A bag of tissue.

544
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,939
-What?
-Scandalous.

545
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:25,272
It's gone.

546
00:22:25,306 --> 00:22:26,738
He must have
packed the ring

547
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:28,372
last night before bed.

548
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:30,671
He's going to
propose to Samantha in Miami.

549
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:31,937
So you think we're
all gonna become, like,

550
00:22:31,973 --> 00:22:33,839
one big happy family?

551
00:22:33,872 --> 00:22:35,872
No one said happy.
No offense to your mom.

552
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:37,406
She actually seems
quite wonderful.

553
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,805
Yeah. It's you
we're not thrilled about.

554
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,205
Well, the feeling is mutual.

555
00:22:41,241 --> 00:22:43,139
And you guys
can keep Dave too.

556
00:22:43,173 --> 00:22:44,306
My dad died when I was little

557
00:22:44,339 --> 00:22:45,374
and I've done
just fine without one.

558
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:49,039
I'm sorry, Miles.

559
00:22:49,072 --> 00:22:50,406
Don't be.
I didn't know him.

560
00:22:51,306 --> 00:22:52,906
If Dave and my mom
do get married...

561
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,039
they'll wanna have
their own kids.

562
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,772
And you're not even
Dave's real sons...

563
00:22:55,807 --> 00:22:56,806
you're just a bunch
of chipmunks

564
00:22:56,838 --> 00:22:57,938
that he calls his kids.

565
00:22:57,973 --> 00:22:59,173
Before you guys know it,

566
00:22:59,206 --> 00:23:00,705
you'll be back
out in the forest.

567
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,472
Holding your nuts all winter.

568
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:03,704
Hey.

569
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,406
First of all,
that's what squirrels do.

570
00:23:05,441 --> 00:23:06,940
We are chipmunks.

571
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:09,571
Alvin,
chipmunks do that too.

572
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:11,540
And the fact that
I didn't know that...

573
00:23:11,574 --> 00:23:14,374
is exactly why we cannot
end up back in the forest.

574
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:17,241
But... Dave wouldn't
do that to us.

575
00:23:17,274 --> 00:23:18,939
He already has.

576
00:23:18,972 --> 00:23:20,773
Why do you think you guys are
here and my mom's in Miami?

577
00:23:21,606 --> 00:23:23,374
Meeting of the Munks.

578
00:23:23,406 --> 00:23:26,106
I don't want Miles to be right
any more than you do,

579
00:23:26,141 --> 00:23:28,007
but it all kind of lines up.

580
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,107
New job, new house,
new girlfriend, new family.

581
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:34,407
I don't want to go
back to the forest.

582
00:23:34,442 --> 00:23:37,905
And I am definitely not going
to end up related to that guy.

583
00:23:39,874 --> 00:23:41,374
Nice form.

584
00:23:42,008 --> 00:23:43,406
Here's the deal, Miles.

585
00:23:43,441 --> 00:23:46,141
We all go to Miami
to stop this proposal...

586
00:23:46,173 --> 00:23:48,641
and then we never have to
see each other again.

587
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,574
I'm in.

588
00:23:50,607 --> 00:23:52,373
Can't get you chipmunks
out of my life fast enough.

589
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:54,074
That's the smartest thing
you've said

590
00:23:54,106 --> 00:23:55,273
since we met you.

591
00:23:56,408 --> 00:23:57,440
Are you sure there's

592
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:58,674
enough money
in your piggy bank?

593
00:23:58,708 --> 00:24:00,307
Guys, it's a credit card.

594
00:24:00,341 --> 00:24:01,907
We'll get 4 tickets.
Stop worrying.

595
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,607
Hello, boys.

596
00:24:03,641 --> 00:24:05,040
Hey, Miss Price.

597
00:24:05,074 --> 00:24:06,775
I'm supposed to be
keeping an eye on you...

598
00:24:07,574 --> 00:24:09,240
so I think I'll use...

599
00:24:09,774 --> 00:24:10,741
this one.

600
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,574
How are we gonna get to Miami
if she's gonna be watching us?

601
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:23,608
Guys, I have a plan.

602
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:26,408
The 4 words
society fears most.

603
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,107
I can't believe that worked.

604
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,940
It wasn't so much me

605
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:33,474
as it was the peanuts
dipped in cough syrup.

606
00:24:36,841 --> 00:24:37,809
That's really messed up.

607
00:24:39,141 --> 00:24:40,141
Respect.

608
00:24:40,142 --> 00:24:41,140
Thank you!

609
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:42,941
Alvin, these aren't
even chipmunks.

610
00:24:42,974 --> 00:24:44,307
They're squirrels.

611
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,140
Beggars
can't be choosers.

612
00:24:46,176 --> 00:24:48,274
Besides, once we put them
in the shirts

613
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:50,274
from the Alvin, Simon
and Theodore dolls...

614
00:24:50,309 --> 00:24:52,575
Miss Price won't be able to
tell the difference.

615
00:24:53,109 --> 00:24:54,675
Yeah, let's do it.

616
00:24:54,708 --> 00:24:56,642
I get to change me!

617
00:25:02,009 --> 00:25:04,241
I can't believe I maxed out my mom's
entire card in this one ticket.

618
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:06,741
We're fine.
Just stick to the plan.

619
00:25:06,775 --> 00:25:09,575
I'm starting to think I should
go through cargo with Theo.

620
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,308
Be silent. Be still.

621
00:25:13,076 --> 00:25:14,742
And you. Get in there.

622
00:25:14,775 --> 00:25:16,173
Easy!

623
00:25:16,209 --> 00:25:16,909
-Both of you guys.
-Watch the zipper.

624
00:25:16,942 --> 00:25:18,340
Next!

625
00:25:18,376 --> 00:25:19,776
Who knows what
you're carrying in this thing.

626
00:25:30,843 --> 00:25:31,777
Go on through.

627
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:37,609
Whoa!

628
00:25:38,644 --> 00:25:39,577
What's that?

629
00:25:40,309 --> 00:25:44,375
That is a...
stuffed Alvin doll.

630
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:47,475
You know, from that lame
singing chipmunks group.

631
00:25:48,409 --> 00:25:50,242
Yeah.

632
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:52,873
I'm gonna need to see what's
in that backpack, please.

633
00:25:52,874 --> 00:25:53,475
No.

634
00:25:53,476 --> 00:25:54,675
Yeah.

635
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,643
It's just a doll.

636
00:25:58,675 --> 00:25:59,710
Chucky was just a doll.

637
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,574
This is Alvin.
It's what the "A" is for.

638
00:26:06,142 --> 00:26:08,442
He does a lot of bending
and back up.

639
00:26:09,177 --> 00:26:10,776
He does splits.

640
00:26:12,643 --> 00:26:14,176
He can twist.

641
00:26:15,344 --> 00:26:19,008
Like Linda Blair almost.

642
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:21,609
You can use it
as a weight-loss device.

643
00:26:23,775 --> 00:26:24,509
I can feel the sweat.

644
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:28,110
It even talks.

645
00:26:28,142 --> 00:26:31,610
It says,
"I'm a dumb stupid-head."

646
00:26:36,909 --> 00:26:40,009
Sorry, the batteries
might be a bit low.

647
00:26:40,044 --> 00:26:41,744
I'm a dumb stupid-head!

648
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:44,110
So, he's...!

649
00:26:45,178 --> 00:26:46,877
And it bites.

650
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:48,243
I think that was just
a design flaw.

651
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:49,544
There's probably a recall.

652
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:52,511
You can put the doll
back in the bag.

653
00:26:54,143 --> 00:26:55,243
Not the dark place!

654
00:26:55,277 --> 00:26:56,676
What I am gonna need...

655
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:59,009
is for you to take a step
right over there...

656
00:26:59,044 --> 00:27:01,744
because we're gonna need to
do a quick body search.

657
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,378
Body search?

658
00:27:04,411 --> 00:27:05,277
Body search!

659
00:27:07,411 --> 00:27:08,778
-Good luck, Simon!
-Yeah.

660
00:27:10,677 --> 00:27:11,544
Okay.

661
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:14,144
No.

662
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:15,476
Where to hide, where to hide?

663
00:27:16,878 --> 00:27:18,211
Relax.

664
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:19,543
-Put your arms out.
-They're out.

665
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,508
One last spot to get.

666
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,609
I don't wanna
go to jail.

667
00:27:27,644 --> 00:27:28,777
I don't wanna go to jail!

668
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:40,310
That's not mine.

669
00:27:40,344 --> 00:27:41,577
You just holding it
for a friend?

670
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:44,176
No, no,
not that, not that.

671
00:27:52,778 --> 00:27:54,577
I don't get paid enough.

672
00:27:54,610 --> 00:27:55,411
Get out of here.

673
00:27:56,212 --> 00:27:57,510
<i>Real smooth, Simon.</i>

674
00:27:57,545 --> 00:27:59,977
I'm sorry!
I just, I got so nervous.

675
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,143
You are lucky I don't flush

676
00:28:01,178 --> 00:28:02,544
the both of you
down the toilet!

677
00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:04,743
Well, I'm glad we sent
Theodore to Baggage.

678
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:06,644
He never would have
made it through Security.

679
00:28:07,246 --> 00:28:09,644
Wow! Hi, everyone!

680
00:28:10,311 --> 00:28:12,178
Cold in here, isn't it?

681
00:28:14,179 --> 00:28:17,078
Whoa!

682
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,344
Miles, will you ask
a flight attendant

683
00:28:22,377 --> 00:28:24,077
for some peanuts?
We're hungry.

684
00:28:24,111 --> 00:28:25,978
Yeah. I too would
love a water.

685
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:27,912
But no ice.
It's supposed to be filthy.

686
00:28:27,946 --> 00:28:29,112
Which reminds me.

687
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:30,277
Germs,
germs, go away,

688
00:28:30,313 --> 00:28:31,645
don't come back
any other day, okay.

689
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,513
Shut up and stay out of sight.

690
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,644
Hey! Easy!

691
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:36,179
It smells in here.

692
00:28:36,211 --> 00:28:38,877
If you're not gonna feed us,
I'm going to forage.

693
00:28:38,911 --> 00:28:40,446
Not a great idea, Alvin.

694
00:28:40,479 --> 00:28:42,046
We're not legitimate
passengers!

695
00:28:45,846 --> 00:28:47,512
Sorry!

696
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:50,911
I didn't mean to startle you.

697
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,679
I'm not startled.

698
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:54,645
It's just you're...

699
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:55,879
you're you.

700
00:28:55,911 --> 00:28:57,344
I am me.

701
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:59,578
And, you know,
if you have a pen...

702
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,077
I'm always happy to
sign an autograph for a fan.

703
00:29:04,245 --> 00:29:05,844
I'm not a fan.

704
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:08,110
Okay.

705
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:12,613
Well, I'll be seeing you.

706
00:29:13,579 --> 00:29:16,412
Excuse me! Pardon me!
Coming through.

707
00:29:16,446 --> 00:29:19,780
Now where in this tin can
can I get some snacks?

708
00:29:31,112 --> 00:29:33,112
Baby!

709
00:29:38,678 --> 00:29:40,111
Hi! I'm Theodore.

710
00:29:41,945 --> 00:29:43,378
Inside voice.

711
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,512
Please stop.

712
00:29:46,547 --> 00:29:48,514
You're gonna make
the other animals nervous!

713
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:56,813
Okay, I'll let you out.

714
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:58,780
But you have to promise
to go back in before we land.

715
00:30:02,614 --> 00:30:04,648
Got it. There you go!

716
00:30:04,681 --> 00:30:06,648
Thank you, friend.

717
00:30:12,381 --> 00:30:13,281
Hey!

718
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:16,646
Please, everyone relax!

719
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,913
Mister Monkey? Wha...

720
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,248
Wait! Don't do that.

721
00:30:21,147 --> 00:30:22,813
No. Bad monkey!

722
00:30:24,013 --> 00:30:25,048
I asked you to stop!

723
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:26,913
Hey! Please!

724
00:30:26,945 --> 00:30:28,312
I'm begging you, Monkey Man!

725
00:30:38,346 --> 00:30:39,645
What?

726
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,081
You've never seen a chipmunk
in first class before?

727
00:30:42,113 --> 00:30:44,712
Actually, I recently flew
next to The Chipettes

728
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:46,412
and they were ladies.

729
00:30:46,447 --> 00:30:49,446
<i>Hey. Don't judge me.
I saw Pink Flamingos.</i>

730
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,747
Excuse me.
May I see your boarding pass?

731
00:30:51,782 --> 00:30:55,080
Yeah, well,
funny thing about that.

732
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:56,547
Gotta run!

733
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:57,415
Come here.

734
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,545
Get back here!

735
00:31:03,648 --> 00:31:04,914
Simon! Run!

736
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,046
Where? We're on a plane.

737
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,515
I don't know! Come on.

738
00:31:09,647 --> 00:31:10,548
Freeze!

739
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:13,413
Air marshal.

740
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:14,680
Don't move.

741
00:31:16,246 --> 00:31:18,212
Can we move now?

742
00:31:18,246 --> 00:31:21,546
This is a very
hard pose to hold.

743
00:31:22,715 --> 00:31:23,548
What's that?

744
00:31:26,482 --> 00:31:28,149
This can't be good.

745
00:31:31,081 --> 00:31:32,149
What the...

746
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:34,715
What? What?

747
00:31:35,514 --> 00:31:37,281
All right!
Everybody calm down!

748
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,613
It's just a monkey. All right?

749
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,148
Birds! Birds!

750
00:31:43,248 --> 00:31:46,182
Help! Someone save me!

751
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:47,349
Nice doggy...

752
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:49,648
Theo! Over here! Jump!

753
00:31:50,816 --> 00:31:52,249
Birds and dogs!

754
00:31:52,682 --> 00:31:54,649
My God!

755
00:31:54,682 --> 00:31:55,814
Okay, now there's a goat.

756
00:31:57,215 --> 00:31:59,748
And an otter.
And an otter! God!

757
00:31:59,782 --> 00:32:01,582
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.</i>

758
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:02,849
Listen!

759
00:32:02,883 --> 00:32:04,083
<i>We're going to be making an...</i>

760
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:06,215
<i>emergency landing
in Austin, Texas</i>

761
00:32:06,249 --> 00:32:08,049
<i>due to a herd of
chinchillas in the cockpit.</i>

762
00:32:08,081 --> 00:32:09,116
All right, you heard him!

763
00:32:09,148 --> 00:32:10,713
The plane's going down.

764
00:32:13,048 --> 00:32:15,248
Not down like down-down.

765
00:32:15,281 --> 00:32:17,781
Safely-safely.
We're not crashing!

766
00:32:19,016 --> 00:32:20,249
You people are idiots!

767
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:21,714
We're all gonna die!

768
00:32:21,748 --> 00:32:22,947
What an idiot!

769
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,980
Great speech, Churchill.

770
00:32:25,013 --> 00:32:26,881
You better watch it!

771
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:28,182
Do you know who
you're talking to?

772
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:30,115
I am the police of the sky!

773
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:34,482
Really?

774
00:32:37,316 --> 00:32:39,448
<i>Okay. Let's make
sure we have everything.</i>

775
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:41,114
You released animals
from cargo,

776
00:32:41,149 --> 00:32:42,948
and then you forced
an emergency landing.

777
00:32:42,981 --> 00:32:44,816
We also snuck onto the plane.

778
00:32:44,848 --> 00:32:46,548
-That's right.
-Theodore!

779
00:32:46,583 --> 00:32:49,615
That is three major
infractions on one flight.

780
00:32:49,649 --> 00:32:51,116
Here's a fun fact.

781
00:32:51,151 --> 00:32:53,284
That's three more infractions
than I've ever had

782
00:32:53,316 --> 00:32:54,914
in all my years
as an air marshal.

783
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:56,783
Congratulations on such
a distinguished career, sir.

784
00:32:57,783 --> 00:32:59,416
Did you hear that?

785
00:32:59,449 --> 00:33:01,648
Because of that
"distinguished career"...

786
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,281
I've got a meeting
with Homeland Security

787
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,815
next week about a promotion.

788
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:06,382
-Another congratulations, sir.
-Shut up!

789
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:07,317
What do you think
they're gonna bring up

790
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,750
when they interview me?

791
00:33:08,784 --> 00:33:12,115
My decade
of perfect service...

792
00:33:12,149 --> 00:33:14,114
or that one time
that three chipmunks

793
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:16,483
turned my flight
into Noah's Ark?

794
00:33:16,516 --> 00:33:18,448
Probably the time
with the chipmunks.

795
00:33:18,483 --> 00:33:19,384
Yeah.

796
00:33:20,984 --> 00:33:23,215
I meant the other one.

797
00:33:23,249 --> 00:33:25,650
Look, sir, what could
we possibly have done

798
00:33:25,683 --> 00:33:26,882
to make you hate us so much?

799
00:33:30,182 --> 00:33:32,050
I'll tell you what you did.

800
00:33:32,816 --> 00:33:33,949
Whoa!

801
00:33:33,983 --> 00:33:35,149
Holy Christmas.

802
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,116
I got a little
early gift for you.

803
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:40,450
James.

804
00:33:41,117 --> 00:33:42,617
You shouldn't have.

805
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,750
No. Wait a second.

806
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,751
I want to Instagram
a video of your reaction.

807
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:48,581
-Merry Christmas!
-I'm breaking up with you!

808
00:33:48,616 --> 00:33:49,517
What?

809
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:51,716
Thanks.

810
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:54,251
And The Chipmunks?

811
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,082
Grow up, James.

812
00:33:56,518 --> 00:33:57,384
Wait.

813
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:11,518
Awkward.

814
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,750
You provided the soundtrack
to my heartbreak.

815
00:34:14,784 --> 00:34:16,918
But now it's payback time.

816
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:20,950
I am putting you three
on the No-Fly List.

817
00:34:20,984 --> 00:34:21,951
-What? No!
-But we have to get to Miami!

818
00:34:21,984 --> 00:34:23,184
You can't do that!

819
00:34:23,216 --> 00:34:25,582
You see, I'm an air marshal.

820
00:34:25,616 --> 00:34:27,049
I'm all-powerful...

821
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:28,716
I'm all-seeing...

822
00:34:28,749 --> 00:34:31,049
and I'm all-knowing.

823
00:34:31,084 --> 00:34:32,484
Then you obviously know

824
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:34,216
you just made
that entire speech...

825
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,650
with your tie
in a cup of coffee.

826
00:34:36,516 --> 00:34:38,150
Okay.

827
00:34:39,851 --> 00:34:41,751
I'll be back in two minutes.

828
00:34:41,784 --> 00:34:44,650
You also still have a little
parrot poop on your shirt.

829
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:45,518
10 minutes.

830
00:34:46,018 --> 00:34:47,417
And one more thing.

831
00:34:47,451 --> 00:34:49,518
Don't even think
about leaving.

832
00:34:49,552 --> 00:34:52,284
I have a very particular
set of skills.

833
00:34:52,317 --> 00:34:53,917
Skills that I have acquired
over a very long...

834
00:34:53,950 --> 00:34:55,650
You just put your hand
on an ink pad.

835
00:34:59,551 --> 00:35:00,651
15 minutes.

836
00:35:06,586 --> 00:35:09,452
Whoa. That guy is
the mayor of Crazy Town.

837
00:35:09,485 --> 00:35:11,652
We gotta get you out
of here, now. Let's go.

838
00:35:14,452 --> 00:35:15,786
This is gonna be
the best...

839
00:35:20,186 --> 00:35:21,552
-Come on!
-Really?

840
00:35:23,351 --> 00:35:26,452
Nobody runs on
Agent James Suggs.

841
00:35:38,019 --> 00:35:40,118
Come on. Come on. Go.

842
00:35:40,152 --> 00:35:41,618
Here you go.
Thanks so much.

843
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:45,585
Well, that's as far
as my money takes us.

844
00:35:45,618 --> 00:35:48,183
Which puts us 2 hours
and 30 minutes from Miami.

845
00:35:48,217 --> 00:35:49,384
-Hey!
-Yes!

846
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:50,685
-All right!
-By plane.

847
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:52,385
Come on!

848
00:35:52,418 --> 00:35:54,418
Guys, the party
is in three days.

849
00:35:54,451 --> 00:35:56,418
We need to get to Miami. Fast.

850
00:35:57,651 --> 00:36:00,685
And, as if we're not in enough
trouble already, it's Dave.

851
00:36:00,718 --> 00:36:02,318
Man.

852
00:36:02,352 --> 00:36:03,851
Well, we cannot
possibly pick up.

853
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:05,151
We have to pick up,

854
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:06,517
or Dave will know
something is wrong.

855
00:36:06,552 --> 00:36:08,186
Dave's gonna know
something's wrong

856
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,120
when he sees us standing
around a bunch of trash cans,

857
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:12,220
in a parking lot
in the middle of nowhere!

858
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,485
Good point.

859
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:15,786
Ready to go eat?

860
00:36:16,485 --> 00:36:17,585
Yeah.

861
00:36:17,619 --> 00:36:18,750
Everything okay?

862
00:36:18,786 --> 00:36:20,086
Let me check on something.

863
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:22,152
Hello?

864
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:23,686
Hi, it's Dave.
Are you busy?

865
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,319
<i>Hi, Dave.</i>

866
00:36:25,353 --> 00:36:27,052
No, I'm not busy at all.

867
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:30,019
No, I'm just dining
with a friend.

868
00:36:30,053 --> 00:36:31,319
What do you need?

869
00:36:31,352 --> 00:36:32,285
All right, I'm gonna
take a look.

870
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,254
I'm right at the window.

871
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:37,521
No!

872
00:36:39,921 --> 00:36:41,319
They've eaten everything!

873
00:36:43,021 --> 00:36:45,254
And I mean everything!

874
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:46,552
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

875
00:36:46,587 --> 00:36:49,219
Just like a guinea pig
Armageddon!

876
00:36:49,253 --> 00:36:50,787
Well, thanks for checking
on them, Miss Price.

877
00:36:53,387 --> 00:36:54,486
False alarm.

878
00:36:54,521 --> 00:36:55,520
Sounds like
they're having a blast.

879
00:36:55,554 --> 00:36:56,653
Good.

880
00:36:56,686 --> 00:36:57,686
-You ready?
-Yeah.

881
00:37:01,486 --> 00:37:04,984
Alvin, I think maybe we
should go somewhere else.

882
00:37:05,019 --> 00:37:07,719
Whoa, hey. Sorry, fellas.
21 and over.

883
00:37:07,753 --> 00:37:09,184
But it's dark outside,

884
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:10,852
and we don't have
anywhere else to go.

885
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:12,284
Well, I wish I could
help you out,

886
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,720
but I got a bar
packed with people...

887
00:37:13,753 --> 00:37:15,319
waiting to hear a band

888
00:37:15,353 --> 00:37:17,853
whose singer is stuck 50 miles
from here with a flat tire.

889
00:37:17,887 --> 00:37:20,352
So, unless you guys know
anyone who can carry a tune...

890
00:37:20,386 --> 00:37:21,453
I'm gonna have to
bid you good night.

891
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:25,587
How would you feel
about some singing chipmunks?

892
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,687
Whoa! You guys really
know The Chipettes?

893
00:37:27,252 --> 00:37:29,419
Really?

894
00:37:29,453 --> 00:37:31,752
<i>Please welcome, all the way
from Los Angeles, California...</i>

895
00:37:31,786 --> 00:37:33,053
<i>The Chipmunks.</i>

896
00:37:38,987 --> 00:37:39,820
<i>Warm crowd.</i>

897
00:37:41,054 --> 00:37:42,820
So, can you really play?

898
00:37:43,555 --> 00:37:44,654
Can you really sing?

899
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:56,587
<i>Whoo! Put your hands
together for me.</i>

900
00:37:56,621 --> 00:37:57,721
<i>Feels good.</i>

901
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,388
<i>Come on, bass.</i>

902
00:38:03,888 --> 00:38:05,120
<i>More guitar.</i>

903
00:38:06,855 --> 00:38:10,218
<i>My man on drums.
We're taking it to the verse.</i>

904
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:14,719
<i># Ain't no place
It ain't going on</i>

905
00:38:14,753 --> 00:38:17,253
<i># It's going around</i>

906
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:19,887
<i># Like a vagabond</i>

907
00:38:19,921 --> 00:38:22,120
<i># It gets in your bones</i>

908
00:38:22,155 --> 00:38:24,954
<i># Like you caught the flu</i>

909
00:38:24,987 --> 00:38:27,121
<i># Nah, there ain't no cure</i>

910
00:38:27,154 --> 00:38:30,154
<i># You just gotta move
when you feel the groove</i>

911
00:38:30,188 --> 00:38:31,855
<i># Now people on the left</i>

912
00:38:31,888 --> 00:38:33,121
<i># From the left now</i>

913
00:38:33,154 --> 00:38:35,121
<i># Shake your south side</i>

914
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:36,687
<i># People on the right</i>

915
00:38:36,721 --> 00:38:37,887
<i># Let me hear you say</i>

916
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:40,120

<i># Every single girl</i>

00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:42,853
<i># Where my ladies at?</i>

919
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:45,020
<i># Shake your south side</i>

<i>-# Shake your south side

923
00:38:49,922 --> 00:38:51,387
Whoo!

924
00:39:00,821 --> 00:39:02,621
This is where your guy said he
dropped off the little freaks?

925
00:39:02,654 --> 00:39:04,321
Yeah. That'll be 76 bucks.

926
00:39:04,354 --> 00:39:06,221
Okay. I'm law enforcement,
so...

927
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:08,122
Great. 76 bucks.

928
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:11,687
Let me rephrase that.
I'm the police of the sky.

929
00:39:11,721 --> 00:39:13,455
But we're on the ground
and this is a car.

930
00:39:13,488 --> 00:39:14,619
So...

931
00:39:14,655 --> 00:39:15,854
76 bucks.

932
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:16,720
So, that means
nothing to you?

933
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:17,621
Nope.

934
00:39:19,322 --> 00:39:20,387
Okay, I'll be right back.
Don't leave.

935
00:39:20,422 --> 00:39:21,589
The money!

936
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,755
I'm getting it!

937
00:39:22,789 --> 00:39:24,088
<i># Every single girl</i>

938
00:39:24,121 --> 00:39:25,621
<i># Every single girl</i>

939
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,622
<i># Shake your south side</i>

<i># Shake your south side #</i>

943
00:39:35,355 --> 00:39:36,222
Yeah!

944
00:39:39,888 --> 00:39:43,088
It's on.

945
00:39:43,122 --> 00:39:45,388
Alvin,
we've got a problem.

946
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:46,688
No.

947
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:48,723
I'll distract him,
you guys make a run for it.

948
00:39:48,755 --> 00:39:49,655
I'll meet you outside.

949
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:51,756
How dare you!

950
00:39:52,789 --> 00:39:53,823
Over here.

951
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,122
Gotcha!

952
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:04,755
Let me explain.

953
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,489
I have a reason to believe

954
00:40:06,522 --> 00:40:09,988
there's a fugitive chipmunk
in your beard.

955
00:40:10,022 --> 00:40:11,556
You don't think
I'd know if there was

956
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:13,689
an animal living
in my beard?

957
00:40:15,189 --> 00:40:16,722
-I don't.
-Beard peanuts?

958
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:17,657
Gotcha!

959
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:23,355
Watch where
you're throwing people!

960
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:24,290
What are you
gonna do about it?

961
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,656
I am so sorry.

962
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,821
Yeah, sorry about the fight.

963
00:40:36,856 --> 00:40:38,622
Ain't no apology necessary.

964
00:40:38,657 --> 00:40:40,022
Nothing better for business

965
00:40:40,055 --> 00:40:42,088
than a good old-fashioned
bar brawl.

966
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:43,923
-Good luck, outlaws.
-Thanks.

967
00:40:43,957 --> 00:40:45,824
Hey, hey, hey.
Come on, keep it in there!

968
00:40:48,356 --> 00:40:49,291
Yikes!

969
00:41:18,191 --> 00:41:19,223
You come on!

970
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:30,658
I will slice and dice you
like spicy sushi roll!

971
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:37,358
Missed me!

972
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:40,492
You want some
butter with that?

973
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:44,591
Drinks are on you!

974
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,657
What?

975
00:42:06,957 --> 00:42:08,123
So long, Suggsy!

976
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,424
Get out of the way,
hillbillies!

977
00:42:12,458 --> 00:42:14,923
I need to get out
of this bar ASAP!

978
00:42:14,956 --> 00:42:16,122
Hey, we gotta get out of here.

979
00:42:16,157 --> 00:42:17,124
But where's Alvin?

980
00:42:17,157 --> 00:42:18,556
We're gonna leave, man!

981
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:20,423
I'm waiting on a guy
that owes me 76 bucks.

982
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:23,525
You mean that guy?

983
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,392
You know what,
we'll double it.

984
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:26,691
All right.

985
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:28,092
-But Alvin's not here yet!
-Forget about him, let's go!

986
00:42:28,126 --> 00:42:29,224
Wait, wait!

987
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:30,325
There he is, there he is!

988
00:42:30,358 --> 00:42:31,656
You...

989
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:32,991
-Come on, let's go, come on!
-Come on, Alvin! Hurry, hurry!

990
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:35,389
Miles, give me your belt.

991
00:42:35,424 --> 00:42:37,290
-You little hood rats!
-Alvin, run!

992
00:42:37,324 --> 00:42:39,757
I will hunt you down!

993
00:42:39,792 --> 00:42:41,025
Slow down!

994
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,257
Move your furry little feet!

995
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:43,859
-Alvin, let's go!
-Hurry, Alvin!

996
00:42:43,891 --> 00:42:45,792
I will pounce on you!

997
00:42:45,826 --> 00:42:47,225
Alvin, jump!

998
00:42:47,259 --> 00:42:48,725
Hurry up, Alvin, come on!

999
00:42:48,758 --> 00:42:49,626
I will...

1000
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:52,191
Whoopsie.

1001
00:42:52,225 --> 00:42:53,260
take a little nap.

1002
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:58,658
So, how much
is this gonna cost?

1003
00:42:58,693 --> 00:43:01,091
To the nearest
bus station, $32.

1004
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:02,925
we're a little short.

1005
00:43:02,959 --> 00:43:04,257
How short?

1006
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:05,559
About 32 bucks.

1007
00:43:11,125 --> 00:43:12,426
Have a nice night.

1008
00:43:14,159 --> 00:43:15,759
Easy for you to say.

1009
00:43:15,793 --> 00:43:18,159
You're not the one
who has to sleep outside!

1010
00:43:18,192 --> 00:43:20,392
Thanks for nothing!
Drive safely!

1011
00:43:21,426 --> 00:43:22,659
What?

1012
00:43:22,693 --> 00:43:24,426
I hope he gets home safe.

1013
00:43:26,193 --> 00:43:27,558
Ouch!

1014
00:43:27,593 --> 00:43:30,459
I got
a splinter in my tail.

1015
00:43:35,826 --> 00:43:37,658
I can't sleep
without my pillow.

1016
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,491
I don't suppose they make

1017
00:43:40,524 --> 00:43:43,124
Tempur-Pedic
tree branches, do they?

1018
00:43:43,158 --> 00:43:45,457
Seriously, guys?

1019
00:43:45,491 --> 00:43:46,526
You're the ones who
are supposed to be

1020
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,459
comfortable sleeping
in trees, not me.

1021
00:43:48,491 --> 00:43:50,392
We're not talking to you,
okay?

1022
00:43:50,426 --> 00:43:52,292
Not after you tried
to leave me behind!

1023
00:43:52,326 --> 00:43:54,092
First, awesome, because

1024
00:43:54,126 --> 00:43:56,359
I don't wanna
talk to you either.

1025
00:43:56,393 --> 00:43:59,659
And second, you guys would've
done the same thing to me.

1026
00:43:59,693 --> 00:44:03,092
No, Miles, we actually
would have waited for you.

1027
00:44:03,126 --> 00:44:05,192
Yeah, we're in this together.

1028
00:44:05,226 --> 00:44:08,226
You mess with one of us,
you mess with all of us.

1029
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:09,758
I've heard your lame
family motto, man.

1030
00:44:09,793 --> 00:44:11,024
It's a bunch of crap.

1031
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:13,026
People look out
for themselves.

1032
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:15,060
It's biology,
it's what animals do.

1033
00:44:15,093 --> 00:44:17,592
Well, on behalf of
animals everywhere...

1034
00:44:17,627 --> 00:44:19,527
I find your
attitude insulting.

1035
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,527
Call it whatever you want,
man. It's true.

1036
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:23,960
What, you think my dad was

1037
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:25,093
thinking about anyone
other than himself...

1038
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:26,626
when he left me and my mom?

1039
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:28,125
But, I...

1040
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:30,093
I thought you said
your dad was...

1041
00:44:35,526 --> 00:44:36,593
Right...

1042
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:41,529
He might as well have.
He left when I was only five.

1043
00:44:42,528 --> 00:44:43,759
Sorry, Miles.

1044
00:44:43,794 --> 00:44:44,661
Whatever.

1045
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,393
I don't care, you know?

1046
00:44:49,194 --> 00:44:51,027
I've done just fine
without him.

1047
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,626
Miles, listen.

1048
00:44:52,661 --> 00:44:55,094
If Dave and your mom
end up together...

1049
00:44:55,127 --> 00:44:57,027
he's a good person.

1050
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:58,629
He would never bail on you.

1051
00:45:00,227 --> 00:45:01,661
Then why are you
making this trip?

1052
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:05,528
Right.

1053
00:45:07,027 --> 00:45:08,659
Because you think
he's gonna ditch you, too.

1054
00:45:12,661 --> 00:45:14,226
Look, dads are overrated.

1055
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,359
Eventually, you will
get over him leaving.

1056
00:45:19,993 --> 00:45:21,126
Really?

1057
00:45:23,626 --> 00:45:24,527
Yeah.

1058
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:31,827
<i># And meet me there</i>

1059
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:34,794
<i># Bundles of flowers</i>

1060
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:38,261
<i># We wait through
The hours of cold</i>

1061
00:45:42,195 --> 00:45:49,127
<i># Shelter as we go #</i>

1062
00:46:04,962 --> 00:46:06,795
I can't...

1063
00:46:06,829 --> 00:46:08,796
I'm too tired.

1064
00:46:09,494 --> 00:46:10,295
Dude!

1065
00:46:11,563 --> 00:46:12,662
Are you joking?

1066
00:46:14,762 --> 00:46:16,063
I can still see the tree!

1067
00:46:20,128 --> 00:46:21,630
Come on, it's 10 miles
to the bus station.

1068
00:46:21,663 --> 00:46:22,993
Can't you go any faster?

1069
00:46:23,029 --> 00:46:24,795
Not to split hairs,

1070
00:46:24,828 --> 00:46:27,461
but given that our legs
are 90% shorter than yours...

1071
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:32,696
we're technically walking
384% faster than you are.

1072
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,462
Nerd alert!

1073
00:46:39,028 --> 00:46:40,527
Fine.

1074
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:41,794
Come on up.

1075
00:46:41,828 --> 00:46:43,227
Really?

1076
00:46:43,261 --> 00:46:44,560
Changing my mind in three...

1077
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:45,794
-All right!
-Yes!

1078
00:46:45,828 --> 00:46:46,728
Two...

1079
00:46:47,029 --> 00:46:48,361
one.

1080
00:46:48,395 --> 00:46:49,396
-Come on, come on!
-Whoo-hoo!

1081
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:51,962
Thank you.

1082
00:46:51,996 --> 00:46:53,295
Sweet!

1083
00:46:53,328 --> 00:46:56,527
Now this is quite
an efficient way to travel.

1084
00:46:56,561 --> 00:46:58,927
Yeah. I could go for miles
on Miles.

1085
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:00,695
My God, that's so bad.

1086
00:47:00,729 --> 00:47:02,161
Then why are you laughing?

1087
00:47:02,195 --> 00:47:03,928
Because that was so bad.

1088
00:47:03,963 --> 00:47:05,796
I think that joke
missed by miles.

Look how obvious
these tracks are.

1113
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:12,330

Did some chipmunks
jump on your bus?

1124
00:48:44,998 --> 00:48:47,164
They bought a ticket
to New Orleans.

1125
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:50,663

Looks like our luck is finally
turning around.

1132
00:49:10,631 --> 00:49:11,665
It's not.

1133
00:49:12,564 --> 00:49:13,996
No! Suggs?

1134
00:49:14,030 --> 00:49:15,532
Hello, boys.

1135
00:49:15,564 --> 00:49:16,465
How did you find us?

1136
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:21,164
I'm an air marshal!

1137
00:49:21,198 --> 00:49:23,996
Law enforcement's my life.

1138
00:49:24,031 --> 00:49:26,166
Now, we can either do this
the easy way...

1139
00:49:26,663 --> 00:49:28,598
or the hard way.

1140
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,733
My brothers and I would like
to discuss our options.

1141
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:33,064
You only got one option.

1142
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:34,697
Chipmunk jail.

1143
00:49:34,732 --> 00:49:36,498
With tiny little bars,

1144
00:49:36,531 --> 00:49:38,698
and a tiny little barbed wire
fence, and a tiny toilet...

1145
00:49:38,732 --> 00:49:41,465
and a tiny yard where you can
lift your tiny little weights!

1146
00:49:41,965 --> 00:49:43,365
It sounds adorable.

1147
00:49:43,865 --> 00:49:45,064
Hey!

1148
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:47,198
Guys, slingshot. On three.

1149
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:48,666
-One, two, three!
-Now, I don't have all night.

1150
00:49:49,698 --> 00:49:50,999
Nuts.

1151
00:49:51,033 --> 00:49:52,499
We chose the hard way.

1152
00:49:53,834 --> 00:49:54,834
Hope you're okay.

1153
00:49:56,731 --> 00:49:57,863
-He's coming!
-Watch out, gangway!

1154
00:49:57,897 --> 00:49:59,229
Hurry, Theodore, run!

1155
00:49:59,265 --> 00:50:00,964
-Let's go! Come on, hurry up!
-Excuse us!

1156
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,531
-Come on, Alvin! He's coming!
-Go, Miles, go!

1157
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:03,764
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
In here! Come on!

1158
00:50:07,865 --> 00:50:09,631
-Whoo, I think we lost him.
-Hey!

1159
00:50:09,665 --> 00:50:10,664
Disregard.

1160
00:50:10,698 --> 00:50:11,532
Come back here!

1161
00:50:13,998 --> 00:50:15,197
Excuse me, pardon me.

1162
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:16,231
There's a crazy guy
chasing us!

1163
00:50:20,398 --> 00:50:23,598
You look tired, baby.
Here you go.

1164
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:24,398
Thank you so much.

1165
00:50:27,166 --> 00:50:28,332
Nice one, Suggsy!

1166
00:50:28,367 --> 00:50:29,433
That tastes like fire!

1167
00:50:30,031 --> 00:50:31,163
It's moonshine.

1168
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:32,698
Fire, please put it out!

1169
00:50:32,732 --> 00:50:33,633
Wash it down with this, here.

1170
00:50:36,198 --> 00:50:37,499
That's butterscotch.

1171
00:50:37,533 --> 00:50:38,499
Butterscotch liquor.

1172
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:41,466
And moonshine!

1173
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,066
Hi, Suggs!

1174
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,598
Yes!

1175
00:50:47,699 --> 00:50:49,197

00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:16,668
<i>Party!</i>

1246
00:53:17,101 --> 00:53:20,434
<i>Alvin!</i>

1247
00:53:20,468 --> 00:53:22,535
<i>Alvin!</i>

1248
00:53:25,968 --> 00:53:27,367
Did you guys hear that?

1249
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:28,633
Hear what?

1250
00:53:28,668 --> 00:53:30,433
Never mind.

1251
00:53:30,469 --> 00:53:32,900
Guys, last night was one
of the best nights of my life.

1252
00:53:32,933 --> 00:53:35,002
It was pretty crazy.

1253
00:53:35,034 --> 00:53:36,900
Even that Suggs guy
hung out with us.

1254
00:53:36,935 --> 00:53:38,767
Yeah, he's not
that bad after all.

1255
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,169
Hey, we missed
a call from Dave.

1256
00:53:41,002 --> 00:53:42,134
And a text.

1257
00:53:42,701 --> 00:53:44,301
27 of them.

1258
00:53:45,469 --> 00:53:46,601
No.

1259
00:53:51,602 --> 00:53:52,602
Where am I?

1260
00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:54,868
What is this?

1261
00:53:58,836 --> 00:54:00,336
-Suggs!
-Who are you?

1262
00:54:00,369 --> 00:54:03,067
It's Vitto,
the band's manager, remember?

1263
00:54:03,101 --> 00:54:05,201
The only thing I remember

1264
00:54:05,235 --> 00:54:08,569
is being attacked
by a trombone.

1265
00:54:08,603 --> 00:54:10,002
Right, yeah.

1266
00:54:10,036 --> 00:54:11,735
You got that crazy bump
on your head.

1267
00:54:11,768 --> 00:54:13,002
You didn't care, though.

1268
00:54:13,036 --> 00:54:15,335
You just wanted to party!

1269
00:54:15,369 --> 00:54:18,136
We hit every jazz club
in the Quarter.

1270
00:54:20,169 --> 00:54:22,036
What do you mean, "We"?

1271
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:25,171
You, me, and those
dope chipmunk dudes!

1272
00:54:28,903 --> 00:54:33,735
I partied with
those tree-skunks?

1273
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,103
They're the ones who dared you
to get that sassy tattoo!

1274
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,536
What? What?

1275
00:54:44,404 --> 00:54:46,336
How could I have let them
talk me into this?

1276
00:54:46,370 --> 00:54:48,269
No.
You asked for that one.

1277
00:54:48,303 --> 00:54:50,304
The other one was their idea.

1278
00:54:53,036 --> 00:54:54,568
What "other one"?

1279
00:54:56,769 --> 00:54:57,670
What?

1280
00:55:10,171 --> 00:55:12,435
This is where they told us
to meet them, right?

1281
00:55:12,468 --> 00:55:15,101
Well, yelled at us
to meet them.

1282
00:55:15,136 --> 00:55:16,602
Hopefully they had time to
cool off on the plane.

1283
00:55:16,638 --> 00:55:17,471
There you are.

1284
00:55:17,937 --> 00:55:19,136
-Dave!
-Dave!

1285
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:20,735
-Mom!
-Don't "Dave, Mom" us.

1286
00:55:20,770 --> 00:55:21,970
You know what, Dave?

1287
00:55:22,004 --> 00:55:23,470
You're an artist,
and you're emotional...

1288
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:25,136
and you follow
your heart, but maybe

1289
00:55:25,171 --> 00:55:26,570
I should take
the lead on this one.

1290
00:55:26,604 --> 00:55:27,803
You know,
we keep a level head.

1291
00:55:27,836 --> 00:55:29,103
Throw them a little Good Cop.

1292
00:55:29,137 --> 00:55:30,171
Okay.

1293
00:55:30,172 --> 00:55:31,204
Okay.

1294
00:55:31,237 --> 00:55:33,369
Don't you "Dave, Mom" us.

1295
00:55:33,403 --> 00:55:35,304
Do you have any idea
how terrifying it is...

1296
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:37,472
to find out that your children
are 2,000 miles

1297
00:55:37,505 --> 00:55:39,104
away from where
they're supposed to be?

1298
00:55:39,137 --> 00:55:40,369
You are lucky that
there are witnesses,

1299
00:55:40,405 --> 00:55:42,137
because I am
so mad right now...

1300
00:55:42,169 --> 00:55:43,735
-that I could just spit!
-Okay, okay.

1301
00:55:43,770 --> 00:55:45,035
Right here, on this floor!

1302
00:55:45,071 --> 00:55:47,804
Okay, okay. Nice Good Cop.

1303
00:55:47,837 --> 00:55:50,703
Dave, I swear, it wasn't as
crazy as it looked on TV.

1304
00:55:50,739 --> 00:55:52,105
Really?

1305
00:55:52,138 --> 00:55:53,337
Well, let me just
pull up some of

1306
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:54,703
Theodore's tweets
from last night.

1307
00:55:55,872 --> 00:55:57,370
"Only one word
to describe this night,

1308
00:55:57,404 --> 00:55:59,735
"Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy."

1309
00:55:59,771 --> 00:56:01,303
Or, "If you wanna get crazy,

1310
00:56:01,338 --> 00:56:03,004
"go to New Orleans.
It's the craziest."

1311
00:56:03,037 --> 00:56:04,836
Or, "In a New Orleans
Jazz Parade,

1312
00:56:04,872 --> 00:56:06,204
"so crazy."

1313
00:56:06,236 --> 00:56:07,503
We're really sorry, Dave.

1314
00:56:07,537 --> 00:56:09,403
Sorry's not gonna
cut it this time, guys.

1315
00:56:09,438 --> 00:56:11,238
If it were up to me,
we'd be going home,

1316
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:13,503
but I gotta get back to Miami.

1317
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:15,971
Do not smile.
You guys are grounded in Miami

1318
00:56:16,004 --> 00:56:17,469
and also when
we get back to LA.

1319
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:19,272
When are we
not grounded?

1320
00:56:19,304 --> 00:56:21,337
You'll be so old,
your fur will be gray.

1321
00:56:21,371 --> 00:56:22,638
Yeah, that goes for
your fur too, Miles.

1322
00:56:22,672 --> 00:56:24,035
I don't have fur.

1323
00:56:24,071 --> 00:56:25,037
Well, whatever you have
is grounded...

1324
00:56:25,071 --> 00:56:26,404
for a long time. Let's go.

1325
00:56:27,704 --> 00:56:29,537
They didn't
kill us after all.

1326
00:56:29,571 --> 00:56:30,771
Feels like a win.

1327
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:33,637
Hey, guys, Operation
"No Proposal" is still on.

1328
00:56:33,670 --> 00:56:34,837
-Yeah!
-All right!

1329
00:56:36,170 --> 00:56:37,538
High... Fist.

1330
00:56:37,572 --> 00:56:39,304
Give me some.

1331
00:56:39,337 --> 00:56:40,404
-Sorry.
-Take it easy!

1332
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,604
-Guys, come on.
-Jeez.

1333
00:56:41,637 --> 00:56:42,538
Yeah.

1334
00:56:44,371 --> 00:56:45,771
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1335
00:56:45,804 --> 00:56:47,371
You're welcome.
And may I see your ID, please?

1336
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:48,305
Yes.

1337
00:56:49,138 --> 00:56:50,636
Thank you.

1338
00:56:50,671 --> 00:56:52,003
Hey...

1339
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:53,938
Are you sure about this?

1340
00:56:53,972 --> 00:56:56,004
Because if this
three-ring circus

1341
00:56:56,037 --> 00:56:57,804
is too scary for you,
I totally get it...

1342
00:56:57,839 --> 00:56:59,638
and we could just
go back to LA.

1343
00:56:59,673 --> 00:57:01,473
I mean, you wouldn't be
the first guy

1344
00:57:01,506 --> 00:57:04,038
to head for the hills once
we showed our crazy cards.

1345
00:57:04,072 --> 00:57:05,972
Please, your circus
only has one ring.

1346
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,471
Stop looking at me.

1347
00:57:07,503 --> 00:57:08,570
Mine's
the three-ringer.

1348
00:57:08,605 --> 00:57:09,804
You're the one
who should think

1349
00:57:09,838 --> 00:57:10,572
about heading for the hills.

1350
00:57:11,672 --> 00:57:13,371
I'm not going anywhere.

1351
00:57:13,405 --> 00:57:14,539
Except to get us a coffee.

1352
00:57:15,405 --> 00:57:16,440
I'll meet you at the gate.

1353
00:57:17,605 --> 00:57:18,505
Sir?

1354
00:57:19,206 --> 00:57:20,604
Is there a problem?

1355
00:57:20,638 --> 00:57:21,904
Problem? What problem?

1356
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,172
There sure is.

1357
00:57:25,573 --> 00:57:26,971
-Man.
-Right.

1358
00:57:27,006 --> 00:57:28,405
-Whoopsies.
-That.

1359
00:57:28,439 --> 00:57:29,506
Guys.

1360
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:30,605
Nuts.

1361
00:57:36,105 --> 00:57:39,005
Seriously, guys,
the No-Fly List? Come on!

1362
00:57:39,039 --> 00:57:40,873
At least we're not
on the No-Drive List.

1363
00:57:40,905 --> 00:57:43,306
There's no such thing
as a No-Drive List, Theodore.

1364
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:45,206
I'm sure you guys will
find a way to start one.

1365
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:47,340
Let's not overreact, Dave.

1366
00:57:47,373 --> 00:57:48,340
The only reason we left home
in the first place...

1367
00:57:48,373 --> 00:57:50,307
Guys, not now, okay?

1368
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:53,340
I worked my butt off

1369
00:57:53,374 --> 00:57:55,606
on Ashley's album,
and because of you three...

1370
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,338
I might not even get to
the record release!

1371
00:57:58,373 --> 00:58:01,171
Not to mention, you've ruined
this trip for me and Samantha.

1372
00:58:01,204 --> 00:58:03,505
It's just, when you took
Samantha to Miami...

1373
00:58:03,539 --> 00:58:05,039
Theodore, I'm not
in the mood to hear it.

1374
00:58:05,072 --> 00:58:06,438
But Dave, we don't...

1375
00:58:06,472 --> 00:58:08,474
Alvin, don't.
You'll just make it worse.

1376
00:58:11,772 --> 00:58:13,472
Thank you for nothing.

1377
00:58:15,239 --> 00:58:16,504
Agent Suggs, Air Marshal.

1378
00:58:16,538 --> 00:58:17,540
I'll be with you
in a moment, sir.

1379
00:58:17,572 --> 00:58:19,272
Okay, you're gonna
regret that.

1380
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:34,706
Did you help three chipmunks
get their rental car today?

1381
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:36,206
Yeah, they came in.

1382
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,372
With some guy,
probably their dad.

1383
00:58:38,407 --> 00:58:40,240
Probably not their dad,
because he's a human...

1384
00:58:40,274 --> 00:58:41,691
and they're chipmunks!

1385
00:58:41,692 --> 00:58:43,106
Hey!

1386
00:58:43,139 --> 00:58:45,039
Families come in all
shapes and sizes, sir.

1387
00:58:45,072 --> 00:58:46,239
It's not for me to judge.

1388
00:58:46,273 --> 00:58:47,639
We don't do that here,
at Miss Bee's.

1389
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:49,406
Okay, this is how
it's gonna go down...

1390
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,139
I need you to go back there,

1391
00:58:51,174 --> 00:58:54,208
and get me the GPS information
for that rental car.

1392
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:56,241
We don't track
our rental cars, sir.

1393
00:58:56,273 --> 00:58:57,674
Is that so?

1394
00:58:58,942 --> 00:59:01,339
I work for the
United States government...

1395
00:59:01,372 --> 00:59:03,539
and we pretty much
track everything.

1396
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:04,807
I know what you had
for lunch today.

1397
00:59:05,874 --> 00:59:06,741
Falafel!

1398
00:59:07,341 --> 00:59:08,707
Now scurry back there,

1399
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:10,240
and get me the frequency

1400
00:59:10,274 --> 00:59:11,808
and uplink code
from that rental car.

1401
00:59:12,874 --> 00:59:14,408
Hey!

1402
00:59:14,441 --> 00:59:17,473
And I need the fastest set
of wheels you've got!

1403
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:26,674
Are you kidding me
right now?

1404
00:59:26,708 --> 00:59:28,008
Do you know what this is?

1405
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:30,440
This is a roller skate
with wheels.

1406
00:59:30,474 --> 00:59:31,741
Pretty sure roller skates
come with wheels.

1407
00:59:36,574 --> 00:59:38,173
It's like Tweety Bird!

1408
00:59:39,074 --> 00:59:40,273
Buckle up!

1409
00:59:40,307 --> 00:59:41,241
Shut up!

1410
00:59:42,208 --> 00:59:44,208
This is like driving
a parakeet!

1411
00:59:50,308 --> 00:59:52,707
Those rodents got
a 200-mile head start.

1412
00:59:53,940 --> 00:59:56,739
Time to roll up
some road, Suggs.

1413
00:59:58,875 --> 01:00:00,141
<i># So say Geronimo!</i>

1414
01:00:00,174 --> 01:00:01,575
<i># Say Geronimo!</i>

1415
01:00:02,042 --> 01:00:03,775
<i># Say Geronimo!</i>

1416
01:00:03,808 --> 01:00:05,506
<i># Say Geronimo!</i>

1417
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:07,141

<i># Say Geronimo!</i>

1419
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,075
Come on!

1420
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:17,474
Fly, Bee! Fly!

1421
01:00:17,508 --> 01:00:18,775
-Are we there yet?
-No.

1422
01:00:18,809 --> 01:00:19,941
-Are we there yet?
-No.

1423
01:00:19,976 --> 01:00:21,276
-Are we there yet?
-No.

1424
01:00:23,975 --> 01:00:25,641
-All right!
-Awesome!

1425
01:00:25,674 --> 01:00:27,440
Remember, guys, we're here
to make a quick pit stop...

1426
01:00:27,475 --> 01:00:28,874
then we're getting
back on the road.

1427
01:00:28,908 --> 01:00:30,408
Don't worry, Dave,
it'll be really quick.

1428
01:00:30,442 --> 01:00:32,076
Yeah, super quick.

1429
01:00:35,609 --> 01:00:39,742
Thanks, Dave. I just needed a little
snack to get me from lunch to dinner.

1430
01:00:39,776 --> 01:00:41,274
That's unusual.

1431
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:42,807
Don't be mad, Dave.

1432
01:00:42,841 --> 01:00:44,575
It would have been rude
to not order something.

1433
01:00:44,608 --> 01:00:47,974
Hey, guys! Look what I won!
Isn't he cute?

1434
01:00:48,008 --> 01:00:49,908
Look at that face!

1435
01:00:49,941 --> 01:00:50,809
That's actually funny, Alvin.

1436

Now we're talking.

1445
01:01:11,176 --> 01:01:12,376
Wow.

1446
01:01:14,775 --> 01:01:17,141
Holy guacamole!

1447
01:01:17,175 --> 01:01:18,741
I could live here.

1448
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,008
Hey, no smiling.

1449
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:21,309
You're still grounded,
remember?

1450
01:01:22,043 --> 01:01:23,126
Thanks.

1451
01:01:23,127 --> 01:01:24,209
Thank you.

1452
01:01:24,242 --> 01:01:25,976
This is what
I'm talking about.

1453
01:01:26,009 --> 01:01:27,075
Hi.

1454
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:29,276
<i>Wow! Hola!</i>

1455
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:32,008
Baby.

1456
01:01:32,042 --> 01:01:33,508
If this is grounded...

1457
01:01:33,542 --> 01:01:34,707
ground me for life.

1458
01:01:34,743 --> 01:01:35,643
Don't tempt me.

1459
01:01:37,676 --> 01:01:38,875
Hey, Dave!

1460
01:01:38,910 --> 01:01:40,408
We'd like to do
the mature thing...

1461
01:01:40,443 --> 01:01:42,243
and accept
partial responsibility

1462
01:01:42,276 --> 01:01:43,875
for all the trouble
we've caused.

1463
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:44,942
-Partial?
-Yeah.

1464
01:01:44,976 --> 01:01:46,276
60-40, on us.

1465
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:49,308
70-30?

1466
01:01:49,342 --> 01:01:51,210
As much as I hate the idea of
letting you three

1467
01:01:51,242 --> 01:01:53,376
out of my sight
for even a second...

1468
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:56,442
Samantha and I have dinner
plans that I can't get out of.

1469
01:01:56,476 --> 01:01:58,042
So if anything happens,
we'll be at the villa.

1470
01:01:58,077 --> 01:01:59,876
Romantic.

1471
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:01,175
What?

1472
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,110
Hi.

1473
01:02:03,111 --> 01:02:04,110
Hi.

1474
01:02:04,142 --> 01:02:06,176
All right, you are
not to leave this room.

1475
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:07,977
-Do you understand, young man?
-Yeah.

1476
01:02:08,009 --> 01:02:09,910
You guys don't
have to worry about us.

1477
01:02:09,944 --> 01:02:12,009
We'll be on our
best behavior tonight.

1478
01:02:12,044 --> 01:02:13,776
I promise. Whoa.

1479
01:02:13,810 --> 01:02:15,042
I know you will,
because I hired

1480
01:02:15,076 --> 01:02:16,410
a babysitter to keep
an eye on you.

1481
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:17,809
-What? Come on.
-Man.

1482
01:02:17,842 --> 01:02:19,208
We'll be home after the party.

1483
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:24,410
Almost forgot this.

1484
01:02:31,978 --> 01:02:33,142
Dave is going
to propose tonight.

1485
01:02:33,177 --> 01:02:34,675
What gave that away?

1486
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,444
The romantic dinner
or the engagement ring?

1487
01:02:36,477 --> 01:02:37,977
Alvin, what are we
going to do?

1488
01:02:38,011 --> 01:02:39,811
Absolutely nothing.

1489
01:02:39,844 --> 01:02:41,311
-What?
-Alvin's right.

1490
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:43,344
This hasn't been so bad.

1491
01:02:44,676 --> 01:02:46,178
Maybe we just...

1492
01:02:47,011 --> 01:02:48,478
-do nothing.
-"Nothing"?

1493
01:02:48,511 --> 01:02:51,542
Guys, "nothing" isn't a plan!
We can't do "nothing."

1494
01:02:51,576 --> 01:02:53,008
Sure we can.

1495
01:02:53,043 --> 01:02:55,310
Good luck proposing
without this.

1496
01:02:55,344 --> 01:02:57,677
Alvin!
When did you grab it?

1497
01:02:57,710 --> 01:03:00,143
I found it in his bag,
five minutes ago.

1498
01:03:00,176 --> 01:03:02,009
Does that mean we did it?

1499
01:03:02,045 --> 01:03:03,079
We did it.

1500
01:03:03,543 --> 01:03:04,710
Huzzah!

1501
01:03:07,943 --> 01:03:09,776
<i># Turn down for what?</i>

1502
01:03:11,811 --> 01:03:13,178
Whoo-hoo! We did it!

1503
01:03:13,778 --> 01:03:15,745
We did it! Whoo-hoo!

1504
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:18,544
<i># Turn down for what? #</i>

1505
01:03:23,177 --> 01:03:25,676
Come on, Miles,
join the party?

1506
01:03:27,511 --> 01:03:28,478
Miles?

1507
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,177
-Miles, wait up!
-Come on, man.

1508
01:03:34,212 --> 01:03:35,344
Let's celebrate! We did it!

1509
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,845
Yeah.

1510
01:03:36,878 --> 01:03:37,945
You guys ruined
Dave's proposal

1511
01:03:37,978 --> 01:03:38,911
and now we
don't have to hang out.

1512
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:40,410
Miles, hold on.

1513
01:03:40,444 --> 01:03:41,877
That doesn't mean
we can't be friends.

1514
01:03:41,912 --> 01:03:43,243
Yeah, man.

1515
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,044
I thought we had a great time
in New Orleans.

1516
01:03:45,077 --> 01:03:46,209
So did I. And then
I saw you celebrating

1517
01:03:46,243 --> 01:03:47,611
like you won the Super Bowl...

1518
01:03:47,644 --> 01:03:49,244
the second you found out
we weren't gonna be family.

1519
01:03:49,278 --> 01:03:50,410
So... see you.

1520
01:03:51,013 --> 01:03:53,179
Miles, wait! I can explain!

1521
01:03:53,211 --> 01:03:55,510
Guys, come on. Miles...

1522
01:03:55,546 --> 01:03:57,612
We've been through
a lot together.

1523
01:03:57,646 --> 01:03:59,012
Don't walk away now.

1524
01:03:59,045 --> 01:04:00,144
Yeah. Come on, Miles.

1525
01:04:02,878 --> 01:04:03,712
Miles?

1526
01:04:04,447 --> 01:04:05,646
Miles? Miles!

1527
01:04:06,045 --> 01:04:07,878
Watch out!

1528
01:04:07,911 --> 01:04:09,344
Alvin, he can't hear us!

1529
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:10,945
I'll knock him
out of the way!

1530
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:12,047
-Slingshot on three!
-Let's do this.

1531
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:13,312
One...

1532
01:04:13,345 --> 01:04:14,345
two...

1533
01:04:14,379 --> 01:04:15,645
three!

1534
01:04:15,678 --> 01:04:16,678
Whoa!

1535
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:28,311
-Theo.
-Theodore!

1536
01:04:32,145 --> 01:04:33,678
-Theo.
-Theodore.

1537
01:04:33,712 --> 01:04:35,411
-Is he okay?
-I don't know.

1538
01:04:35,444 --> 01:04:39,077
Theo! Come on!
Get up! Please!

1539
01:04:44,645 --> 01:04:46,012
No! Theodore!

1540
01:04:46,046 --> 01:04:47,278
Come on!

1541
01:04:47,311 --> 01:04:48,179
Say something, say something!

1542
01:04:49,811 --> 01:04:51,545
I smell...

1543
01:04:52,613 --> 01:04:53,680
empanadas?

1544
01:04:53,713 --> 01:04:54,546
Theo!

1545
01:04:55,278 --> 01:04:56,280
Theo, you're alive!

1546
01:04:56,713 --> 01:04:57,946
Is this Heaven?

1547
01:04:57,979 --> 01:04:59,012
No, it's South Beach.

1548
01:05:00,247 --> 01:05:02,512
Theodore, you saved my life.

1549
01:05:02,545 --> 01:05:05,279
Like we always say,
you mess with one of us...

1550
01:05:06,212 --> 01:05:08,312
Don't make me say it, man,
it's so lame.

1551
01:05:08,346 --> 01:05:10,112
Miles, he got hit
by a car for you.

1552
01:05:11,013 --> 01:05:12,679
-You mess with all of us.
-All right!

1553
01:05:12,712 --> 01:05:14,911
Whoo-hoo! Ouch!

1554
01:05:14,946 --> 01:05:17,545
Miles, we are so sorry.

1555
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:20,545
We haven't been fair to you
from day one.

1556
01:05:20,579 --> 01:05:21,613
And the truth is...

1557
01:05:23,747 --> 01:05:25,680
you'd make a great brother.

1558
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:26,446
Yeah!

1559
01:05:27,347 --> 01:05:29,546
I feel the same
about you guys.

1560
01:05:29,579 --> 01:05:31,945
So, I guess we're going to be
family after all.

1561
01:05:31,981 --> 01:05:34,115
Except for one tiny detail...

1562
01:05:34,148 --> 01:05:35,445
By stealing the ring,

1563
01:05:35,478 --> 01:05:37,678
we've effectively
ruined the proposal.

1564
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:38,779
You're right.

1565
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:42,047
We need to get that ring,
and get to that restaurant!

1566
01:05:42,080 --> 01:05:43,480
Let's do it. Come on.

1567
01:05:48,746 --> 01:05:50,748
Looks like Air Marshal Suggs

1568
01:05:50,781 --> 01:05:53,312
is gonna be checking into
the Shelborne Hotel.

1569
01:05:53,714 --> 01:05:54,947
Yes!

1570
01:05:54,981 --> 01:05:57,446
Time for a chip hunt!

1571
01:05:57,481 --> 01:05:58,979
I really
wanna go with you...

1572
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:00,247
but I'm stuck babysitting.

1573
01:06:00,281 --> 01:06:01,546
Aw, man.
The babysitter.

1574
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,946
I hope when they get here,
they're not annoying.

1575
01:06:03,981 --> 01:06:05,478
-Let's go.
-Like, this last time...

1576
01:06:05,512 --> 01:06:07,845
I had a kid,
and he was, like...

1577
01:06:07,879 --> 01:06:09,947
"My gosh, can I have
yogurt?" And I was like...

1578
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:11,445
"My gosh,
can you go to sleep?"

1579
01:06:11,479 --> 01:06:12,379
I don't think
she knows we're here.

1580
01:06:12,413 --> 01:06:13,879
I was like, "Ridiculous."

1581
01:06:13,912 --> 01:06:15,278
I don't think
she knows she's here.

1582
01:06:15,312 --> 01:06:18,046
This really sucks,
when you're so responsible,

1583
01:06:18,080 --> 01:06:20,247
and, like, everyone
around you is so not.

1584
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:22,248
You know what I mean?
It's like, it's hard.

1585
01:06:22,281 --> 01:06:24,179
There you are.

1586
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:25,446
Well, okay, I'm totally
texting you right now.

1587
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:26,680
Hold on, let me
send you this picture.

1588
01:06:28,246 --> 01:06:30,414
He's, like, super cute.
I really like him.

1589
01:06:30,447 --> 01:06:32,380
-Come on! Let's go.
-Aw, I know.

1590
01:06:32,414 --> 01:06:34,214
What are you talking about?
I like that he's hairy.

1591
01:06:34,248 --> 01:06:36,048
Hairy, you say?

1592
01:06:36,081 --> 01:06:37,780
Yeah, scruffy's, like, cute.

1593
01:06:37,815 --> 01:06:41,281
It's like, "Hi, I am adorable,
but I'm also an animal."

1594
01:06:42,013 --> 01:06:43,546
You know? Yeah, I know.

1595
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,513
Yeah, right. Miles!
We're on our way.

1596
01:06:45,547 --> 01:06:47,013
Yeah, I know he's
a little short, but

1597
01:06:47,047 --> 01:06:48,281
I don't know, you know
that famous saying...

1598
01:06:48,314 --> 01:06:49,847
Theo! Come on! Let's go!

1599
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:51,214
"little things come in big
packages," or whatever.

1600
01:06:51,247 --> 01:06:52,181
-Man.
-It's like that.

1601
01:06:53,381 --> 01:06:54,980
I think
she liked me.

1602
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,048
I, like, could be
doing so many more

1603
01:06:56,082 --> 01:06:57,680
important things right now.

1604
01:06:57,713 --> 01:06:59,581
I could be, I don't know,
getting a pedicure?

1605
01:07:00,981 --> 01:07:03,314
I'm looking for
some chipmunks.

1606
01:07:06,282 --> 01:07:08,248
Guys, their reservation
was at 8:00.

1607
01:07:08,282 --> 01:07:10,383
So, we still might have time
to save the proposal.

1608
01:07:10,914 --> 01:07:12,881
Come on, let's go. Go!

1609
01:07:12,914 --> 01:07:14,846
Listen to me, I
know these chipmunks are here.

1610
01:07:14,882 --> 01:07:16,448
This is a badge for the United
States government, okay?

1611
01:07:16,482 --> 01:07:17,581
Okay, guys,
here's the plan...

1612
01:07:17,614 --> 01:07:18,814
-So, I need for you...
-No. It's Suggs!

1613
01:07:19,515 --> 01:07:20,746
He found us.

1614
01:07:20,781 --> 01:07:23,080
Theodore, get up!

1615
01:07:23,114 --> 01:07:24,881
Miles, you gotta get
the ring to Dave!

1616
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:26,114
I'm not leaving you guys.

1617
01:07:26,149 --> 01:07:27,748
We'll distract him. Just go!

1618
01:07:27,783 --> 01:07:29,049
Run, run!

1619
01:07:29,083 --> 01:07:30,381
-Theo! Hurry!
-Get back here!

1620
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:32,215
I'm going
as fast as I can!

1621
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:33,948
Think of donuts,
think of donuts!

1622
01:07:33,981 --> 01:07:36,116
Donuts? Whoo-hoo!

1623
01:07:36,149 --> 01:07:37,149
-Go, Miles, go!
-Hurry!

1624
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,749
Run, run!

1625
01:07:38,782 --> 01:07:40,114
-Hide over here!
-Where?

1626
01:07:40,149 --> 01:07:41,748
I don't know!
Just think of something!

1627
01:07:50,647 --> 01:07:52,682
Come on. Where are you?

1628
01:07:53,515 --> 01:07:54,482
Where are you?

1629
01:07:58,749 --> 01:07:59,982
Come on.

1630
01:08:00,015 --> 01:08:02,247
Come on. Come on.

1631
01:08:15,514 --> 01:08:17,549
Hi... ya.

1632
01:08:17,583 --> 01:08:18,348
See ya!

1633
01:08:23,682 --> 01:08:24,748
Go, go, go!

1634
01:08:24,783 --> 01:08:25,948
Run, run!

1635
01:08:25,981 --> 01:08:27,783
Hurry, hurry! He's coming!

1636
01:08:29,048 --> 01:08:30,783
Hurry, Alvin.
Hit the button!

1637
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:32,182
Come on, Alvin! Hurry, hurry!

1638
01:08:37,983 --> 01:08:41,182
Here's Suggsy!

1639
01:08:41,216 --> 01:08:42,515
-He's like the Terminator!
-Yeah!

1640
01:08:45,082 --> 01:08:46,281
No.

1641
01:08:46,317 --> 01:08:48,115
This is ironic.

1642
01:08:48,149 --> 01:08:50,050
We're gonna be going up...

1643
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:52,448
but I'm taking you boys down.

1644
01:08:53,715 --> 01:08:55,749
Now, here's what's
gonna happen...

1645
01:08:57,149 --> 01:08:58,616
I'm gonna turn you over
to Homeland Security...

1646
01:08:58,649 --> 01:08:59,883
and they're gonna put you
in a zoo prison

1647
01:08:59,916 --> 01:09:01,049
for dangerous animals.

1648
01:09:01,084 --> 01:09:02,349
No.

1649
01:09:02,383 --> 01:09:04,483
And then, if you ever
get out of there...

1650
01:09:04,517 --> 01:09:06,417
I'm gonna pay someone to
have you stuffed.

1651
01:09:06,451 --> 01:09:07,617
Right.

1652
01:09:07,651 --> 01:09:09,982
And I'm gonna give you
as a gift to Anna,

1653
01:09:10,017 --> 01:09:11,816
who will hopefully
take me back.

1654
01:09:11,849 --> 01:09:14,284
Dude, I'm sorry,
but it's over.

1655
01:09:15,284 --> 01:09:16,550
-You don't know that.
-Theo, let's go.

1656
01:09:16,584 --> 01:09:18,048
I just think there's something
wrong with her phone

1657
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:19,083
and she's not getting
my texts...

1658
01:09:19,115 --> 01:09:21,249
or the flowers,
or my candy grams.

1659
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,049
And I, personally,
don't think it's uncommon...

1660
01:09:23,084 --> 01:09:23,984
for someone to move
five times a year

1661
01:09:24,017 --> 01:09:24,984
and change their number.

1662
01:09:25,017 --> 01:09:26,916
Okay? It's normal.

1663
01:09:26,949 --> 01:09:29,549
Yeah. Totally normal.

1664
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:30,750
Alvin!

1665
01:09:30,783 --> 01:09:31,949
What? What's going on?

1666
01:09:31,983 --> 01:09:33,783
And that's our cue to leave.

1667
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:36,315
It has been a treat.

1668
01:09:36,349 --> 01:09:37,650
No... What are you doing?

1669
01:09:37,684 --> 01:09:38,684
Elevator power off.

1670
01:09:39,251 --> 01:09:40,818
No! No!

1671
01:09:52,518 --> 01:09:53,649
Excuse me!

1672
01:09:53,684 --> 01:09:54,650
Pardon me!

1673
01:09:54,684 --> 01:09:56,251
Miles!

1674
01:09:56,283 --> 01:09:58,149
Hey. What happened to
Officer Dingleberry?

1675
01:09:58,183 --> 01:10:00,683
Let's just say
his elevator got stuck.

1676
01:10:00,716 --> 01:10:02,383
Has Dave proposed yet?

1677
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:04,250
No, but they're on dessert.
It can't be long.

1678
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,416
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

1679
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:06,484
Okay.

1680
01:10:08,317 --> 01:10:09,649
You remember what to do?

1681
01:10:09,684 --> 01:10:10,916
-Yes, sir. Be no problem.
-There's the box.

1682
01:10:10,951 --> 01:10:12,850
-It's go time.
-Excuse me...

1683
01:10:12,884 --> 01:10:14,516
Young man, we have a strict

1684
01:10:14,550 --> 01:10:16,849
no pets policy
at this restaurant.

1685
01:10:16,883 --> 01:10:18,949
I'm going to have to ask you
to take your meerkats home.

1686
01:10:18,985 --> 01:10:19,985
Meerkats!

1687
01:10:20,017 --> 01:10:21,417
Esteban.

1688
01:10:21,451 --> 01:10:24,016
Please escort these things
out of the restaurant.

1689
01:10:24,050 --> 01:10:25,651
All right, all right.

1690
01:10:25,685 --> 01:10:28,183
Come on, guys.
We know when we're not wanted.

1691
01:10:28,218 --> 01:10:30,517
Evasive maneuvers! Nutmeg!

1692
01:10:30,552 --> 01:10:31,883
He shoots, he scores!
Nice, Alvin!

1693
01:10:31,918 --> 01:10:33,151
Go, Alvin, go!

1694
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:34,485
Did you hear that?

1695
01:10:34,517 --> 01:10:35,517
It sounded like somebody
yelled "Alvin."

1696
01:10:35,552 --> 01:10:36,385
Alley-oop!

1697
01:10:37,717 --> 01:10:38,551
Whoo-hoo!

1698
01:10:39,119 --> 01:10:40,384
Pardon me!

1699
01:10:40,418 --> 01:10:41,650
I think you're imagining it.

1700
01:10:41,685 --> 01:10:42,785
-Alvin!
-I'm open!

1701
01:10:42,819 --> 01:10:43,718
Or not.

1702
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:00,185
Gotcha!

1703
01:11:00,586 --> 01:11:01,952
Whoo-hoo! Cold!

1704
01:11:01,984 --> 01:11:03,551
Whoa!

1705
01:11:04,817 --> 01:11:06,017
Alvin?

1706
01:11:06,052 --> 01:11:07,684
Hi there, Dave.

1707
01:11:08,983 --> 01:11:11,550
Don't say it.
Resist the urge.

1708
01:11:11,584 --> 01:11:13,851
We all know you wanna say it,
but hear me out.

1709
01:11:13,884 --> 01:11:15,316
Miles? What?

1710
01:11:15,352 --> 01:11:16,483
We can explain everything.

1711
01:11:16,518 --> 01:11:17,717
Well, I can't wait
to hear this.

1712
01:11:18,651 --> 01:11:19,917
Dave, we came to Miami

1713
01:11:19,952 --> 01:11:21,084
to stop you two
from getting engaged.

1714
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:25,284
No.

1715
01:11:25,317 --> 01:11:28,284
I just blew the surprise.

1716
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,418
But, and this is the part that
I'd like you to focus on...

1717
01:11:31,418 --> 01:11:33,250
when Theodore
got hit by a car...

1718
01:11:33,285 --> 01:11:34,752
Theodore got hit by a car?

1719
01:11:34,785 --> 01:11:36,084
I did.

1720
01:11:36,119 --> 01:11:38,618
He's fine. He was
saving Miles' life.

1721
01:11:38,651 --> 01:11:40,151
Wait, he what?

1722
01:11:40,185 --> 01:11:42,685
The point is,
we realized that...

1723
01:11:42,718 --> 01:11:45,084
we like the idea of
you two being together,

1724
01:11:45,118 --> 01:11:46,685
and we changed our minds.

1725
01:11:46,718 --> 01:11:47,586
Yep.

1726
01:11:48,552 --> 01:11:50,086
It might not be
the family in the photo

1727
01:11:50,118 --> 01:11:51,818
that comes with the frame...

1728
01:11:51,852 --> 01:11:54,819
but it's gonna be our family.
And we're proud of it.

1729
01:11:56,086 --> 01:11:58,086
Guys, that ring isn't mine.

1730
01:11:58,118 --> 01:12:01,086
So, you're not proposing?

1731
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:05,086
I'm sorry, Samantha. I'm not.

1732
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:06,153
Thank God.

1733
01:12:07,054 --> 01:12:08,120
I mean,
that's not what I meant.

1734
01:12:08,153 --> 01:12:09,485
You know. I mean, not that

1735
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:10,718
I couldn't see it
happening someday.

1736
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,451
I mean... Not that
I'm expecting it to happen.

1737
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:14,120
But I mean,
if it did happen...

1738
01:12:14,152 --> 01:12:15,852
I'm spiraling, aren't I?

1739
01:12:15,887 --> 01:12:17,253
-A little.
-What I mean is...

1740
01:12:18,553 --> 01:12:22,220
I would love it if we could
just take our time because...

1741
01:12:22,254 --> 01:12:24,287
I really want it to work.

1742
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:26,286
Me, too.

1743
01:12:28,154 --> 01:12:30,386
I'm very
confused right now.

1744
01:12:30,419 --> 01:12:32,618
You brought this ring to Miami

1745
01:12:32,651 --> 01:12:35,385
and you said you had to
come to dinner, so...

1746
01:12:35,418 --> 01:12:37,684
I was holding it for Barry.

1747
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,486
My sound engineer.

1748
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,285
He's proposing to
his girlfriend, Alice,

1749
01:12:41,320 --> 01:12:43,086
at the restaurant right now...

1750
01:12:43,118 --> 01:12:44,818
-with an empty ring box.
-My God.

1751
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:45,918
Will you marry me?

1752
01:12:45,953 --> 01:12:48,252
It's not empty.

1753
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:54,519
A breath mint?

1754
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,452
Miss Grey, over here.

1755
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:13,453
When are you
going back on tour?

1756
01:13:13,487 --> 01:13:15,353
The greenroom is
right this way, Mr. Seville.

1757
01:13:17,986 --> 01:13:19,318
The only reason
we're not headed

1758
01:13:19,353 --> 01:13:20,686
back to LA right now
is because...

1759
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:22,388
I have to be here.

1760
01:13:22,420 --> 01:13:25,088
As soon as the show is over,
we're all going home.

1761
01:13:27,588 --> 01:13:29,187
I don't think I've ever been
more disappointed

1762
01:13:29,220 --> 01:13:30,521
in you guys
than I am right now.

1763
01:13:35,553 --> 01:13:37,753
If Dave didn't wanna
get rid of us before,

1764
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:39,687
he definitely does now.

1765
01:13:39,721 --> 01:13:42,954
All because we only cared
about if we were happy.

1766
01:13:42,988 --> 01:13:45,286
Maybe it's a chipmunk thing,
like hoarding, you know?

1767
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,021
Maybe we're
emotional hoarders?

1768
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,520
Actually, chipmunks are

1769
01:13:48,554 --> 01:13:50,386
traditionally
very caring creatures.

1770
01:13:50,421 --> 01:13:53,253
Nuts.
Well, that means it's us.

1771
01:13:53,288 --> 01:13:55,122
I'd do anything to fix this.

1772
01:13:56,121 --> 01:13:59,421
Wait. Maybe we can fix it.

1773
01:13:59,454 --> 01:14:02,221
By doing the one thing
we do best!

1774
01:14:02,256 --> 01:14:03,756
Cause mischief on
land, sea and air?

1775
01:14:03,788 --> 01:14:04,953
Eat all of Dave's food?

1776
01:14:04,989 --> 01:14:06,955
No! Music!

1777
01:14:06,988 --> 01:14:08,887
When words aren't enough,
we sing!

1778
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:11,019
So let's give Dave
one last song

1779
01:14:11,054 --> 01:14:13,554
to show him
how we really feel about him.

1780
01:14:13,588 --> 01:14:15,786
Miles, start working on
that little country riff

1781
01:14:15,821 --> 01:14:17,086
you were doing in Texas.

1782
01:14:17,121 --> 01:14:18,988
Where are you going?
There's so much to do.

1783
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:20,387
I need to talk to Wardrobe,
we need to...

1784
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:21,953
If we are gonna
bring down the house,

1785
01:14:21,986 --> 01:14:23,487
we're gonna need some backup.

1786
01:14:26,587 --> 01:14:30,788
<i># Once upon a time
I was fallin' in love</i>

1787
01:14:30,821 --> 01:14:32,287
Boy.

1788
01:14:32,321 --> 01:14:34,489
<i># Now it's only
fallin' apart</i>

1789
01:14:34,521 --> 01:14:35,920
Okay.

1790
01:14:35,954 --> 01:14:38,186
<i># Nothin' I can say</i>

1791
01:14:38,221 --> 01:14:43,321
<i># A total
eclipse of the heart #</i>

1792
01:14:47,222 --> 01:14:49,921
Well...

1793
01:14:49,955 --> 01:14:51,588
You're going to Hollywood!

1794
01:14:51,622 --> 01:14:53,588
Alvin!

1795
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:56,189
I'm going to Hollywood!
I'm going to Hollywood!

1796
01:14:56,221 --> 01:14:58,188
Sorry, girls, I've always
wanted to say that.

1797
01:14:58,221 --> 01:14:59,272
What are you doing here?

1798
01:14:59,273 --> 01:15:00,322
Yeah.

1799
01:15:00,355 --> 01:15:02,222
We're kind of in
the middle of auditions.

1800
01:15:02,256 --> 01:15:03,722
I need your help.

1801
01:15:03,755 --> 01:15:06,689
We really screwed up with Dave
and we gotta fix it.

1802
01:15:08,489 --> 01:15:11,421
Because it's for Dave,
we're in.

1803
01:15:11,455 --> 01:15:12,955
<i>Please
give a warm welcome...</i>

1804
01:15:12,988 --> 01:15:14,955
<i>for Miss Ashley Grey!</i>

1805
01:15:21,857 --> 01:15:23,523
<i>Thank you, guys.</i>

1806
01:15:23,555 --> 01:15:25,856
<i>Now, I have a very special
surprise for you...</i>

1807
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:29,321
<i>which was a surprise to me
as well until just now.</i>

1808
01:15:30,389 --> 01:15:32,389
<i>Everybody, welcome
The Chipmunks!</i>

1809
01:15:35,490 --> 01:15:36,621
Thanks, Ashley.

1810
01:15:36,656 --> 01:15:38,289
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

1811
01:15:40,656 --> 01:15:42,556
Before we perform,

1812
01:15:42,589 --> 01:15:45,155
my brothers and I have
a few things to set straight.

1813
01:15:45,889 --> 01:15:47,322
Earlier this evening...

1814
01:15:47,355 --> 01:15:50,889
we accidentally ruined
a very special evening...

1815
01:15:50,922 --> 01:15:53,089
for a very special woman

1816
01:15:53,122 --> 01:15:54,756
and we'd like to
make it up to her.

1817
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:55,856
Yeah.

1818
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,356
Alice?

1819
01:15:57,389 --> 01:15:59,289
Barry has something
he'd like to ask you.

1820
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:00,223
Again.

1821
01:16:05,822 --> 01:16:07,089
Will you marry me this time?

1822
01:16:07,755 --> 01:16:08,689
Yes.

1823
01:16:08,989 --> 01:16:10,023
Aw.

1824
01:16:10,056 --> 01:16:11,422
Yes.

1825
01:16:16,157 --> 01:16:17,289
Thanks, Chipmunks.

1826
01:16:18,356 --> 01:16:21,456
And we just had one more
quick thing to say.

1827
01:16:21,488 --> 01:16:23,055
Dave...

1828
01:16:23,089 --> 01:16:24,422
-We're really sorry.
-We're sorry.

1829
01:16:25,889 --> 01:16:27,689
So we wrote this
last song for you.

1830
01:16:36,955 --> 01:16:39,489
<i># You shine bright</i>

1831
01:16:39,523 --> 01:16:43,255
<i># Brighter than all the stars</i>

1832
01:16:43,289 --> 01:16:46,888
<i># Brighter than fireworks</i>

1833
01:16:46,923 --> 01:16:49,490
<i># So I give you all my love</i>

1834
01:16:52,556 --> 01:16:56,289
<i># And you're perfection
even in your mistakes</i>

1835
01:16:56,324 --> 01:16:59,823
<i># Give affection even
when your heart aches</i>

1836
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:04,724
<i># When I'm away,
you're who I'm thinking of</i>

1837
01:17:04,757 --> 01:17:06,422
<i># Because</i>

1838
01:17:06,457 --> 01:17:10,190
<i># You are my home, home, home</i>

1839
01:17:10,224 --> 01:17:12,125
<i># Wherever I may roam</i>

1840
01:17:12,158 --> 01:17:13,242
Whoo!

1841
01:17:13,243 --> 01:17:14,325
Wow!

1842
01:17:14,358 --> 01:17:17,458
<i># You are the place where
I can rest my weary bones</i>

1843
01:17:17,492 --> 01:17:21,391
<i># You are my home, home, home</i>

1844
01:17:21,425 --> 01:17:24,857
<i># You are my home,
home, home</i>

1845
01:17:37,724 --> 01:17:39,824
Please welcome The Chipettes!

1846
01:17:39,856 --> 01:17:44,790
<i># You're a diamond
brightening my cloudy skies</i>

1847
01:17:44,824 --> 01:17:46,089
Wow.

1848
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:49,490
<i># Sparkling all through
the night</i>

1849
01:17:49,525 --> 01:17:53,092
<i># Light me up like fireflies</i>

1850
01:17:55,324 --> 01:17:58,990
<i># See you shinin'
even in the darkness</i>

1851
01:17:59,024 --> 01:18:02,624
<i># Stand beside me
when I don't deserve it</i>

1852
01:18:02,658 --> 01:18:04,690
<i># That's why I say</i>

1853
01:18:04,725 --> 01:18:07,525
<i># I give you all my love</i>

1854
01:18:07,559 --> 01:18:09,492
<i># Because</i>

1855
01:18:09,524 --> 01:18:10,824
<i># You are my home,
home, home</i>

1856
01:18:10,859 --> 01:18:12,992
Whoo!

1857
01:18:13,024 --> 01:18:16,757
<i># Wherever I may roam</i>

1858
01:18:16,791 --> 01:18:20,257
<i># You are the place where
I can rest my weary bones</i>

1859
01:18:20,291 --> 01:18:23,858
<i># You are my home, home, home</i>

1860
01:18:30,026 --> 01:18:31,892
<i># You're my number one
there's no doubt</i>

1861
01:18:31,924 --> 01:18:33,924
<i># And we stick together
throughout</i>

1862
01:18:33,957 --> 01:18:37,758
<i># Like Boy Scouts, we about
All for one till lights out</i>

1863
01:18:37,791 --> 01:18:41,491
<i># So, Dave, where u at?
Wave your hands front to back</i>

1864
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:44,627
<i># Everybody take a look around
At my dad out in the crowd!</i>

1865
01:18:47,058 --> 01:18:48,558
I love you, Dave!

1866
01:18:59,292 --> 01:19:03,025
<i># You are my home,
home, home #</i>

1867
01:19:06,925 --> 01:19:08,425
-Thank you.
-Nailed it.

1868
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:09,891
Thank you!

1869
01:19:09,926 --> 01:19:11,058
Thank you, my people.

1870
01:19:12,893 --> 01:19:14,158
We still got it.

1871
01:19:14,658 --> 01:19:16,259
Yeah! Whoo!

1872
01:19:16,292 --> 01:19:17,792
Girls, thank you.

1873
01:19:17,827 --> 01:19:19,591
We owe you one.

1874
01:19:19,625 --> 01:19:22,892
You owe us way more than one,
but, you're welcome.

1875
01:19:22,926 --> 01:19:25,158
Guys, we have to
get back to auditions.

1876
01:19:25,192 --> 01:19:27,825
Ryan's been
texting me like crazy.

1877
01:19:27,858 --> 01:19:29,859
Come on, girls. Let's roll.

1878
01:19:31,160 --> 01:19:33,327
Bye, Theodore-able.

1879
01:19:36,026 --> 01:19:39,059
Miles, that was amazing!

1880
01:19:39,093 --> 01:19:43,226
Dave, we're so sorry we came
to Miami without telling you.

1881
01:19:43,258 --> 01:19:45,293
We just didn't wanna lose you.

1882
01:19:45,693 --> 01:19:47,192
Lose me?

1883
01:19:47,227 --> 01:19:49,093
Why would you guys ever think
you were gonna lose me?

1884
01:19:49,126 --> 01:19:50,859
Because you said
you're starting

1885
01:19:50,892 --> 01:19:52,458
a new chapter in your life.

1886
01:19:52,494 --> 01:19:55,026
We thought you might
bail on us.

1887
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,359
Technically,
we're not even a family.

1888
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:58,692
We're just three chipmunks
who live with you.

1889
01:19:59,793 --> 01:20:01,427
Is that what you guys think?

1890
01:20:02,093 --> 01:20:03,526
I mean, I know I haven't

1891
01:20:03,561 --> 01:20:05,361
really been around much
lately, and...

1892
01:20:05,394 --> 01:20:07,327
things are changing for us,

1893
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:08,692
but I'd never
bail on you guys.

1894
01:20:09,292 --> 01:20:10,826
Because we are a family.

1895
01:20:12,161 --> 01:20:13,661
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

1896
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,594
And I was probably
a little over-the-top

1897
01:20:18,627 --> 01:20:20,926
on the whole
"no music" thing, okay?

1898
01:20:20,961 --> 01:20:22,694
-You guys can perform.
-All right!

1899
01:20:22,728 --> 01:20:24,126
But locally. Okay?

1900
01:20:24,161 --> 01:20:25,727
Sure!

1901
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,459
And I promise to be a better
dad from here on out.

1902
01:20:28,493 --> 01:20:31,027
What are you
talking about, Dave?

1903
01:20:31,060 --> 01:20:33,560
You're the best dad
we could ever have.

1904
01:20:35,228 --> 01:20:36,626
What do you say to
a little family dinner

1905
01:20:36,660 --> 01:20:37,925
when we get home?

1906
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,527
You know, so we know where

1907
01:20:39,562 --> 01:20:41,160
our kids are the entire time
we're together?

1908
01:20:41,192 --> 01:20:42,592
That sounds perfect.

1909
01:20:42,627 --> 01:20:44,160
Whoo-hoo! We rocked it!

1910
01:20:44,192 --> 01:20:47,525
Simon, did you see me?
I was on fire!

1911
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,392
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

1912
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:51,126
but I had fun getting
in trouble with you guys.

1913
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:52,961
The trip might be over,

1914
01:20:52,994 --> 01:20:54,293
but as long as
Alvin is around,

1915
01:20:54,326 --> 01:20:56,060
we'll always get into trouble.

1916
01:20:56,094 --> 01:20:57,093
Thanks, Si!

1917
01:20:57,094 --> 01:20:58,093
Not a compliment.

1918
01:20:58,127 --> 01:20:59,828
My God,
you guys were awesome.

1919
01:21:00,726 --> 01:21:01,526
Hey, Miles, right?

1920
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,626
Wow, you played great!

1921
01:21:04,662 --> 01:21:06,427
Thanks! Your cool song...

1922
01:21:06,462 --> 01:21:10,660
I mean... I love when...
Music with your mouth...

1923
01:21:10,694 --> 01:21:11,793
Brother.

1924
01:21:13,260 --> 01:21:15,161
-You're great.
-Thank you.

1925
01:21:15,193 --> 01:21:16,392
She bought it.

1926
01:21:16,427 --> 01:21:18,595
Anyways, I have this party

1927
01:21:18,627 --> 01:21:20,992
I'm supposed to go to
in L.A. Saturday night...

1928
01:21:21,028 --> 01:21:21,994
if, maybe you'd wanna...

1929
01:21:22,028 --> 01:21:23,293
Definitely, yeah.

1930
01:21:23,328 --> 01:21:24,694
I'd, definitely
would like to...

1931
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:26,261
Yes. Definitely.

1932
01:21:26,296 --> 01:21:28,162
Okay. Well then
I'll definitely,

1933
01:21:28,194 --> 01:21:29,693
definitely see you there.

1934
01:21:29,928 --> 01:21:30,829
Okay.

1935
01:21:31,728 --> 01:21:33,161
-Bye.
-Bye.

1936
01:21:34,062 --> 01:21:35,428
Smooth, Miles.

1937
01:21:36,461 --> 01:21:37,861
Real smooth.

1938
01:21:37,893 --> 01:21:39,094
Bye.

1939
01:21:39,961 --> 01:21:41,161
-All right!
-Hey, ready?

1940
01:21:41,396 --> 01:21:42,560
Yeah.

1941
01:21:42,594 --> 01:21:43,428
Bye, guys.

1942
01:21:45,262 --> 01:21:46,695
Come on, guys. Let's go home.

1943
01:21:48,161 --> 01:21:50,427
Should we remind him we're
on the No-Fly List?

1944
01:21:50,896 --> 01:21:52,396
Definitely not.

1945
01:22:08,561 --> 01:22:10,095
this doesn't look like home.

1946
01:22:10,129 --> 01:22:11,360
It's not.

1947
01:22:11,396 --> 01:22:12,330
We have one more
important thing

1948
01:22:12,363 --> 01:22:14,095
to do before we go home.

1949
01:22:14,127 --> 01:22:16,594
Dave, we've been
driving for three days!

1950
01:22:16,628 --> 01:22:17,827
Can't it wait?

1951
01:22:17,862 --> 01:22:19,260
Unfortunately not, boys.

1952
01:22:19,295 --> 01:22:20,495
The courthouse
is closed tomorrow.

1953
01:22:21,162 --> 01:22:22,562
I'm sorry, the what house?

1954
01:22:23,662 --> 01:22:25,429
Are we going to jail?

1955
01:22:25,461 --> 01:22:27,129
We didn't mean to cause an
emergency landing, Dave!

1956
01:22:27,162 --> 01:22:29,361
It was freezing in cargo!

1957
01:22:29,394 --> 01:22:32,428
Does this look like a face
that will survive prison?

1958
01:22:34,429 --> 01:22:35,429
Come on.

1959
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:38,728
Dave Seville?

1960
01:22:38,763 --> 01:22:39,595
Yep, that's me.

1961
01:22:40,262 --> 01:22:41,428
By signing this...

1962
01:22:41,461 --> 01:22:43,894
you not only agree
to take care of,

1963
01:22:43,928 --> 01:22:45,361
but to provide for the health,

1964
01:22:45,396 --> 01:22:46,896
welfare and
educational needs...

1965
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:48,428
of Alvin, Simon and Theodore.

1966
01:22:48,995 --> 01:22:50,528
I do.

1967
01:22:50,562 --> 01:22:52,927
Alvin, Simon and Theodore,
do you agree to this adoption?

1968
01:22:52,963 --> 01:22:54,728
Adoption?

1969
01:22:54,762 --> 01:22:56,496
That's why we're here?

1970
01:22:57,663 --> 01:22:59,963
You're adopting us?

1971
01:22:59,995 --> 01:23:01,695
You guys were right.

1972
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:04,463
Even though you consider me
to be your dad, and...

1973
01:23:04,495 --> 01:23:06,828
I love you like my own sons,
it's never been official.

1974
01:23:06,864 --> 01:23:08,695
So I figured...

1975
01:23:08,729 --> 01:23:10,162
let's make it official.

1976
01:23:17,497 --> 01:23:18,329
Chipmunks?

1977
01:23:18,663 --> 01:23:19,563
Yes?

1978
01:23:21,697 --> 01:23:24,096
I still need you to say
something like "I agree."

1979
01:23:24,130 --> 01:23:25,328
Just to make it legal.

1980
01:23:26,296 --> 01:23:28,430
Yeah! I agree!

1981
01:23:29,029 --> 01:23:30,663
Yeah. Me, too!

1982
01:23:30,697 --> 01:23:32,296
1,000%!

1983
01:23:32,331 --> 01:23:33,496
And that's not even
a real number.

1984
01:23:34,962 --> 01:23:37,098
Does this mean we're Sevilles?

1985
01:23:38,032 --> 01:23:40,031
On this day...

1986
01:23:40,064 --> 01:23:41,795
David Seville has
officially adopted

1987
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:44,463
Alvin, Simon and Theodore
to be his children.

1988
01:23:44,496 --> 01:23:45,996
You three now have
all the legal rights

1989
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,162
of any natural child.

1990
01:23:47,197 --> 01:23:48,329
Or, chipmunk.

1991
01:23:49,731 --> 01:23:53,129
I hereby sign this order
confirming this adoption.

1992
01:23:53,164 --> 01:23:54,197
Congratulations.

1993
01:23:54,231 --> 01:23:55,362
Thank you.

1994
01:23:55,397 --> 01:23:56,331
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yay!

1995
01:23:58,062 --> 01:23:59,995
This is amazing! Yes!

1996
01:24:00,030 --> 01:24:01,897
Guys, guys... Just...

1997
01:24:01,930 --> 01:24:03,663
Up high, Judge. Give me some.

1998
01:24:03,696 --> 01:24:05,029
-Whoo-hoo! I'm so happy!
-Awesome!

1999
01:24:05,064 --> 01:24:05,963
-Dave!
-Whoa!

2000
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:07,297
Sweet!

2001
01:24:07,330 --> 01:24:08,629
Yes! We're a family!

2002
01:24:08,663 --> 01:24:09,963
We have a dad. Legally.

2003
01:24:09,997 --> 01:24:11,262
Okay.

2004
01:24:11,297 --> 01:24:12,629
Okay, all right. Alvin, okay.

2005
01:24:12,663 --> 01:24:13,696
What an amazing day!

2006
01:24:14,996 --> 01:24:16,363
-They're excited.
-Yes!

2007
01:24:22,930 --> 01:24:24,430
Hey, official and legal Dad?

2008
01:24:24,463 --> 01:24:26,631
Yes, official and legal son?

2009
01:24:26,663 --> 01:24:30,230
Thanks for being the best
official and legal dad, Dad.

2010
01:24:30,265 --> 01:24:32,630
Well, you three are the best
official and legal sons

2011
01:24:32,663 --> 01:24:34,964
an official and legal father
could ask for.

2012
01:24:34,997 --> 01:24:37,031
Aw. That's sweet
of you to say, Dad.

2013
01:24:37,064 --> 01:24:38,964
Yeah.

2014
01:24:38,997 --> 01:24:41,997
But seriously, guys, this is
the happiest day of my life.

2015
01:24:42,032 --> 01:24:44,032
Literally nothing
could ruin it for me.

2016
01:24:48,930 --> 01:24:50,863
Boy.

2017
01:24:50,897 --> 01:24:52,896
Alvin.

2018
01:24:52,930 --> 01:24:55,130
Totally forgot about this.

2019
01:25:00,898 --> 01:25:04,429
Alvin!

01:25:44,901 --> 01:25:46,202
I was just stuck
in your elevator of death

2044
01:25:46,236 --> 01:25:47,335
for hours and
I'm probably out of a job...

2045
01:25:47,368 --> 01:25:48,903
so I'm gonna sit in this chair

2046
01:25:48,936 --> 01:25:51,171
by this pool,
and I'm gonna relax.

2047
