1
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,751
Eyes on Kahili objective.

2
00:00:49,711 --> 00:00:53,465
19:30 hours.
Entering surveillance hour four.

3
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:56,176
No sign of target.

4
00:01:01,723 --> 00:01:03,183
Noncombatant approaching.

5
00:01:14,652 --> 00:01:15,862
Two noncombatants.

6
00:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,948
<i>Fresh op. New heading, 1-8-0.</i>

7
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:22,660
<i>Insurgents sighted four klicks north,
deploying weapons.</i>

8
00:01:26,706 --> 00:01:29,751
Sensor, slew the ball
to new coordinates.

9
00:02:04,661 --> 00:02:06,287
Eyes on new objective.

10
00:02:07,205 --> 00:02:08,414
Throttling back.

11
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:12,168
<i>Guns are hot. Target qualifies.
Engage at your discretion.</i>

12
00:02:12,252 --> 00:02:13,419
Roger that.

13
00:02:20,218 --> 00:02:22,720
Civilian bus, one klick south.

14
00:02:25,265 --> 00:02:28,184
<i>Too close, Major.
Get the strike on this pass, or abort.</i>

15
00:02:29,686 --> 00:02:30,770
Copy that.

16
00:02:31,771 --> 00:02:32,772
I can get it.

17
00:02:32,897 --> 00:02:33,898
<i>Rifle when ready.</i>

18
00:02:33,982 --> 00:02:35,483
Master arm hot.

19
00:02:35,567 --> 00:02:37,110
Fly the laser.

20
00:02:37,193 --> 00:02:38,528
<i>Target, lasered.</i>

21
00:02:39,404 --> 00:02:41,155
Three, two,

22
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:44,284
one, rifle.

23
00:02:44,742 --> 00:02:48,079
Missile away.
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

24
00:02:58,256 --> 00:02:59,299
Splash.

25
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:16,316
Good kill.

26
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:20,903
Well, they don't call it
a Hellfire for nothing.

27
00:03:20,987 --> 00:03:24,032
Best use of $68,000 taxpayer dollars
I've seen today.

28
00:03:24,115 --> 00:03:26,409
Master arm off. Weapon's safe.

29
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:28,494
Laser safe.

30
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,455
Damage assessment.

31
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,501
Come on, Carlos. Tighten up.

32
00:03:38,338 --> 00:03:39,339
What's the body count?

33
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,637
I count six, sir.

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,514
But good luck figuring out
which bits go in what casket.

35
00:03:49,641 --> 00:03:51,934
Setting a course for J-bad.

36
00:03:53,895 --> 00:03:55,188
Watch yourself, Tommy.

37
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:57,398
You're beak-to-beak
with that Reaper relieving you.

38
00:03:57,482 --> 00:03:58,816
- Yes, sir.
- Two o'clock.

39
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:02,487
MQ-9. American engineering
at its finest.

40
00:04:03,696 --> 00:04:06,616
All right. Hand off to
Captain Christie for recovery.

41
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:21,858
Is that real?

42
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:27,029
You ever get to, like,
fly in a war or something?

43
00:05:29,157 --> 00:05:32,160
Blew away six Taliban
in Pakistan just today.

44
00:05:33,453 --> 00:05:34,787
Now I'm going home to barbeque.

45
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:36,497
Yeah, right.

46
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,535
- It's not my fault.
- Travis, get back here right now.

47
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:18,039
Get back here
and pick up the crap you just dumped!

48
00:06:18,122 --> 00:06:20,583
Do not walk away from me, young man!

49
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,710
Do not walk away from me.

50
00:06:24,003 --> 00:06:25,338
Travis!

51
00:06:28,299 --> 00:06:30,343
Feel free to step in anytime, Tommy.

52
00:06:30,426 --> 00:06:31,636
I'll talk to him.

53
00:06:32,345 --> 00:06:36,098
I got a call from the principal's office.
He was fighting with another boy.

54
00:06:36,182 --> 00:06:37,558
Did he Win?

55
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:42,480
Hey, Jesse, how's that book?
You recommend it?

56
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:46,484
- Sorry the house looks like...
- A bomb hit it?

57
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:49,028
I didn't say it.

58
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:52,240
I'd ask how your day was,
but there's a limit...

59
00:06:52,323 --> 00:06:53,449
- I know. I'm sorry.
- How many times

60
00:06:53,533 --> 00:06:55,868
- I can ask the same question.
- Thank you for not asking.

61
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,831
You know he's flunking math.
He needs a tutor.

62
00:07:00,706 --> 00:07:04,001
How much will that cost?
Can't you help him?

63
00:07:05,127 --> 00:07:07,964
Where do you think he gets it from?
I'm the reason he's flunking.

64
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:09,507
That's true.

65
00:07:10,132 --> 00:07:11,801
I start nights tomorrow.

66
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,471
Okay.

67
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:53,551
You look miles away.

68
00:07:57,597 --> 00:07:58,764
Seven thousand?

69
00:08:01,392 --> 00:08:02,685
That's a joke.

70
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:09,108
I think I'm gonna go get a glass of water.

71
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:12,278
You need anything?

72
00:08:15,448 --> 00:08:16,616
Yeah, I do.

73
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:33,299
Living the dream, Tommy.

74
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,843
Hey, Dan.

75
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,372
Ladies and gentlemen,
the aircraft you're looking at

76
00:09:04,455 --> 00:09:06,624
is not the future of war.

77
00:09:06,707 --> 00:09:08,793
It is the here and fucking now.

78
00:09:09,377 --> 00:09:10,795
Any time of day or night,

79
00:09:10,878 --> 00:09:13,965
there are dozens of
these things in the sky

80
00:09:14,048 --> 00:09:15,424
above our theaters of operation.

81
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:19,387
And most are currently working in the
Garden of Eden they call Afghanistan.

82
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,870
Where they're starting to think
it's their new national bird.

83
00:09:22,974 --> 00:09:24,266
Now, I assume you know

84
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,602
we don't fly them all the way there
from here in Vegas,

85
00:09:26,686 --> 00:09:28,437
but I guess I shouldn't assume anything.

86
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:30,856
I got food in my fridge
older than most of you.

87
00:09:30,982 --> 00:09:33,776
Now, all take-offs and landings occur

88
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:36,529
in and around
whatever godforsaken place

89
00:09:36,612 --> 00:09:38,531
we're at war with that day.

90
00:09:38,614 --> 00:09:41,784
That's 'cause these things are a bitch
to take off and land.

91
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:44,120
So once they're airborne,
that's when we take over.

92
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:46,664
And these gentlemen here are gonna
take you through the nuts and bolts

93
00:09:46,747 --> 00:09:48,082
of exactly how we do that.

94
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:52,837
But before they do, there's one thing
I want to say about this program.

95
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:55,548
We get a lot of shit from the public.

96
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:58,801
And I've heard
all the bleeding heart arguments.

97
00:09:58,884 --> 00:10:01,095
I've read all the fucking bumper stickers.

98
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:02,847
"It's not the air force,
it's the chair-force,"

99
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:04,265
"waging a Wii war."

100
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:07,727
It's all a waste of breath
because the United States Air Force

101
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,229
is ordering more drones than jets.

102
00:10:10,771 --> 00:10:14,191
Excuse me, "remotely piloted aircraft."
You can call them whatever you want.

103
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,236
Drones aren't going anywhere.

104
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:19,780
In fact, they're going everywhere.

105
00:10:23,909 --> 00:10:26,579
But don't think I believe
my own shit either.

106
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:30,249
'Cause we like to dress it up
in fancy language.

107
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:35,588
Prosecuting a target, a surgical strike,

108
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,506
neutralizing the threat.

109
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:40,259
Make no fucking mistake about it.

110
00:10:41,761 --> 00:10:43,262
We are killing people.

111
00:10:44,055 --> 00:10:46,390
So I'm gonna drill this into your heads
every goddamn day.

112
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:48,434
This ain't fucking PlayStation.

113
00:10:50,436 --> 00:10:54,190
Even though the brass
don't like to admit it,

114
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:56,275
our operation was modeled on Xbox.

115
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,320
And half of you were recruited in malls

116
00:10:59,403 --> 00:11:02,364
precisely because
you are a bunch of fucking gamers.

117
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:04,950
And war is now a first-person shooter.

118
00:11:05,034 --> 00:11:07,119
But you pull a trigger here,

119
00:11:07,203 --> 00:11:08,704
it's for fucking real.

120
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,293
Ain't a bunch of pixels
you're blowing up.

121
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,634
It's flesh and fucking blood.

122
00:11:23,844 --> 00:11:26,347
You pull a trigger here,
someone's gonna go away.

123
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:29,809
Now, go away.

124
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:33,395
Dismissed.

125
00:11:33,479 --> 00:11:34,939
Atten-hut!

126
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:38,317
That's a lot of recruits
for a war that's ending.

127
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,070
So what'd you log?
3,000 hours in F-16s,

128
00:11:41,153 --> 00:11:44,156
six tours, 200 combat sorties
before you got here?

129
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,660
Now they give them 40 hours in
a fucking Cessna and send them to me.

130
00:11:47,743 --> 00:11:49,495
And pretty soon they won't even do that.

131
00:11:49,578 --> 00:11:52,623
Just shove a joystick
in their clammy mitts on day one.

132
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,585
By the way, I got a new co-pilot for you.

133
00:11:57,002 --> 00:12:00,673
Last test, Carlos pissed hot. Coke.

134
00:12:01,257 --> 00:12:02,675
I mean, I reckon
he wanted to get busted.

135
00:12:02,758 --> 00:12:04,176
You saw how he was shaking.

136
00:12:04,677 --> 00:12:08,097
It was classic burn-out.
You burn out at 24.

137
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:10,766
I mean, when I was 24,
burn-out hadn't been invented yet.

138
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:12,101
Is that her there?

139
00:12:12,184 --> 00:12:14,436
Yeah, I know she looks like
a fucking child.

140
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,231
But she's got 500 hours in Reapers,
100 in Predators.

141
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,984
Top recruit from Holloman.

142
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:23,737
Listen, word's come down the chain
we're stepping up attacks.

143
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,657
'Cause we got intel that says
they're stepping up attacks.

144
00:12:27,116 --> 00:12:28,492
I mean, it's like my football coach
used to say,

145
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:30,327
"Get your retaliation in first."

146
00:12:33,372 --> 00:12:34,582
What's up?

147
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,876
Can you get me in a plane, sir?

148
00:12:38,752 --> 00:12:41,552
- You not hear what I was just saying?
- No, I heard you. I was just...

149
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,258
They're yanking you jet jockeys
out of your kites faster than ever.

150
00:12:44,341 --> 00:12:48,179
I know how you feel. It's like going from
a Ferrari to a Ford Fiesta, but...

151
00:12:49,471 --> 00:12:51,390
You think any of us love flying at 1-G?

152
00:12:54,185 --> 00:12:56,562
All right, I'll see what I can do. Okay?

153
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,230
- Thank you, sir.
- All right.

154
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,403
Not a word, Drier.
I can't have Egan burn out on me.

155
00:13:04,486 --> 00:13:06,864
I need someone
who can fly these fucking dodos.

156
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:13,162
How can you feel turbulence hit a plane
7,000 miles away? It's un-fucking-canny.

157
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,665
Everyone else is trying to act like
they're in a plane in Afghanistan.

158
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:19,251
Egan fucking is in a plane
in Afghanistan.

159
00:13:26,926 --> 00:13:28,344
Suarez, go in tighter.

160
00:13:32,389 --> 00:13:35,726
Fuel window closing. Can't wait
for Johnny Jihad to make a pit stop.

161
00:13:35,851 --> 00:13:37,091
No, I can take him on the move.

162
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:39,271
- Old Predator, Tommy.
- What's the lag?

163
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:41,482
Latency at 2.2 seconds.

164
00:13:43,609 --> 00:13:46,528
How do you know where he's gonna be
two seconds from now, sir?

165
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:48,239
You don't throw the ball
where the receiver is.

166
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:49,782
You throw where he's gonna be.

167
00:13:49,865 --> 00:13:50,991
Lead them by a cross hair.

168
00:13:56,247 --> 00:13:57,998
One Minnesota, two Minnesota...

169
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:01,043
Isn't it supposed to be Mississippi, sir?

170
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:02,461
I'm from St. Paul.

171
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:04,296
Lead them by another half.

172
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,635
We are cleared hot.

173
00:14:09,718 --> 00:14:12,388
Master arm on. Weapon's hot.

174
00:14:13,305 --> 00:14:16,976
Three, two, one, rifle.

175
00:14:18,102 --> 00:14:19,645
Time of flight, 12 seconds.

176
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:31,907
Yes!

177
00:14:31,991 --> 00:14:33,492
Got them motherfuckers.

178
00:14:34,159 --> 00:14:35,160
Good splash.

179
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:41,583
- Tarfu.
- Tarfu? What's tarfu, sir?

180
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:42,876
Totally and royally fucked up.

181
00:14:44,586 --> 00:14:46,588
And I believe those gentlemen qualify.

182
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:48,465
Thank you, sir.

183
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:50,759
So she's looking at me
and I'm looking at her, right?

184
00:14:50,843 --> 00:14:53,887
So, finally I decide I'm gonna go over
and introduce myself to her.

185
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:56,932
And I say,
"Hi, I'm Captain Joseph Zimmer."

186
00:14:57,016 --> 00:14:58,350
- Nice.
- You know what she says?

187
00:14:58,726 --> 00:15:01,186
She says her name is Anita Mann.

188
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,730
- It's funny.
- Yeah.

189
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:04,273
Well, she was shitfaced, of course.

190
00:15:04,356 --> 00:15:06,650
At a bar at Mandalay Bay
with five of her girlfriends.

191
00:15:06,734 --> 00:15:08,444
She can't get me upstairs fast enough.

192
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:12,364
The girl was getting married
the next fucking day.

193
00:15:13,115 --> 00:15:16,118
Last bachelor party I went to,
I was Dick Burns.

194
00:15:16,201 --> 00:15:17,561
It was either that or Hugh Jorgen.

195
00:15:19,038 --> 00:15:20,122
Classy.

196
00:15:27,463 --> 00:15:29,882
- So, did you volunteer?
- Or were you "volun-told"?

197
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:35,054
I went willingly.
Yeah, I couldn't wait to sign up.

198
00:15:35,137 --> 00:15:38,599
Come on, battlefields and blackjack?
Every girl's fantasy.

199
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:40,559
<i>You'?</i>

200
00:15:40,642 --> 00:15:42,642
In my line,
this is the next best thing to Langley.

201
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:46,732
I applied twice, but I never got past
the background check.

202
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,485
For the life of me,
I don't know what it is.

203
00:15:49,568 --> 00:15:52,237
I don't remember doing anything
that fucking bad.

204
00:15:52,404 --> 00:15:56,742
I flew cargo, Globemasters.
I might as well be working for UPS.

205
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,590
If you want to be where the action is,
this is the tip of the spear.

206
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:09,463
I did six tours.

207
00:16:11,548 --> 00:16:16,011
After the last one, I got back from Iraq,
a row of GCS's on the tarmac.

208
00:16:16,095 --> 00:16:17,805
F-16s in mothballs.

209
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:21,183
Put in one UAV tour, they said.

210
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:23,602
I'm on my third.

211
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:28,273
You got a family.

212
00:16:28,357 --> 00:16:30,526
Must be nice, you know,
go home and see them every day.

213
00:16:33,445 --> 00:16:34,655
We're on duty.

214
00:16:52,965 --> 00:16:54,758
Where superpowers go to die.

215
00:16:56,468 --> 00:17:00,139
Not the British, not the Soviets, not us.

216
00:17:00,597 --> 00:17:04,143
Genghis fucking Khan
couldn't hold onto this fucking place.

217
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:08,355
No one wins a war in Afghanistan.

218
00:17:09,022 --> 00:17:13,068
The only way to win is never put a boot
on the ground. Stay two miles above it.

219
00:17:13,152 --> 00:17:16,780
We have put in 600 Reaper hours
on this target, sir.

220
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:22,286
May I respectfully suggest
that we got the wrong address?

221
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,497
That's not what our intel's saying, Major.

222
00:17:25,581 --> 00:17:27,207
It's a safe house
for the new Number Two.

223
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,672
Who's she?

224
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:37,301
Our intel says she's not related.
Housekeeper.

225
00:17:37,718 --> 00:17:39,386
I always think they can see us.

226
00:17:40,345 --> 00:17:44,516
At 10,000 feet, even if she stared
straight at us, she couldn't see us.

227
00:17:45,976 --> 00:17:47,978
I get tired just watching her work.

228
00:17:48,103 --> 00:17:50,898
My wife by the fucking pool,
she wouldn't last a day over there.

229
00:18:16,173 --> 00:18:18,759
- He's getting good.
- Focus on the compound.

230
00:18:32,856 --> 00:18:35,317
Well, as much as I would like to
watch her put her son to sleep,

231
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,319
I gotta be home before my kids wake up.

232
00:18:37,402 --> 00:18:39,738
- It's all yours, Major.
- Yeah. Good night, sir.

233
00:18:58,882 --> 00:19:01,343
- Is that the target?
- No.

234
00:19:02,636 --> 00:19:04,096
Our target's as round as he is tall.

235
00:19:04,179 --> 00:19:05,597
That's not him.

236
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,453
What is he doing?

237
00:19:31,623 --> 00:19:32,708
Shit.

238
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:43,760
Jesus.

239
00:20:49,701 --> 00:20:50,869
Hey, Tommy.

240
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:57,584
So, I heard you want to
go back to combat.

241
00:21:02,255 --> 00:21:03,590
You told Molly yet?

242
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:07,177
Not yet.

243
00:21:07,636 --> 00:21:10,097
Well, don't take this the wrong way,

244
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,973
but are you out of your fucking mind?

245
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:14,810
I mean, look around, buddy.

246
00:21:15,394 --> 00:21:17,813
We can come home at night.
We can see our kids,

247
00:21:17,896 --> 00:21:21,441
we can get laid and not worry that
there's some other prick going there.

248
00:21:23,235 --> 00:21:25,821
Listen, I don't even know
if it's going to happen.

249
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,360
It's a big fucking mistake.

250
00:21:28,407 --> 00:21:30,242
- Get him!
- Get him!

251
00:21:30,325 --> 00:21:33,078
Hey, hey! You don't shoot the chef.
What are you, crazy?

252
00:21:34,955 --> 00:21:36,832
Hey, get out of here. No, no, no, no, no!

253
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:38,750
Come on. I'll cook you.

254
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:42,087
Come on, no, no, get out of here.
I'll cook both of you.

255
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:46,133
He's quiet. Does he ever get angry?

256
00:21:47,217 --> 00:21:48,593
Almost never.

257
00:21:49,261 --> 00:21:50,541
What happens when he gets angry?

258
00:21:52,681 --> 00:21:54,433
He gets more quiet.

259
00:21:55,934 --> 00:21:57,811
I'm gonna get a refill.

260
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:05,026
Wow.

261
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,362
Look at you.

262
00:22:08,572 --> 00:22:10,365
You went all out today, Mrs. Egan.

263
00:22:10,449 --> 00:22:11,575
Shucks.

264
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:13,785
Cheers.

265
00:22:32,554 --> 00:22:33,805
What is this?

266
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:41,021
You're resigning?

267
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:47,652
- You're up for promotion.
- I was going to talk to you about it.

268
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:49,863
- The pay grade alone...
- Just...

269
00:22:51,907 --> 00:22:54,743
It's only if I don't get
a seat on the Viper.

270
00:22:55,827 --> 00:22:59,039
Combat? That's what you want to do?

271
00:22:59,623 --> 00:23:01,875
So you can worry the kids sick again.

272
00:23:01,958 --> 00:23:04,836
So you never see them or me.

273
00:23:07,339 --> 00:23:11,259
Is it so bad, what you're doing now?

274
00:23:12,677 --> 00:23:14,429
You're still making people safer, right?

275
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:20,268
I mean, what's going on at the base?

276
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:23,772
I mean, no one else in the service cares
about the security clearance bullshit.

277
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:28,193
- I'm your fucking wife.
- It's not about the clearance.

278
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:33,782
I just don't want to rehash it.
It doesn't do any good.

279
00:23:33,865 --> 00:23:36,993
If I have a shit day, why dump it on you?

280
00:23:37,077 --> 00:23:39,621
Does it help me? Does it help you?

281
00:23:39,704 --> 00:23:42,958
You don't know what helps me. I get it.

282
00:23:43,041 --> 00:23:45,836
I get why you don't want to
talk about that.

283
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,338
But you don't want to
talk about anything.

284
00:23:48,421 --> 00:23:50,966
I swear to God,
if I didn't start a conversation,

285
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:53,260
we would never fucking have one!

286
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:59,808
Ever since the drawdown,
things haven't been the same.

287
00:23:59,891 --> 00:24:01,226
You know that.

288
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:04,396
I just want things to go back
to the way they were.

289
00:24:04,563 --> 00:24:08,900
It might have been scarier back then,
but at least we made each other laugh.

290
00:24:10,569 --> 00:24:12,320
We did it in every room in the house.

291
00:24:13,446 --> 00:24:15,490
We did it in parking lots.

292
00:24:17,158 --> 00:24:20,412
Even if we weren't together all the time,

293
00:24:20,495 --> 00:24:23,164
when we were, we were together.

294
00:24:23,915 --> 00:24:25,750
I used to make you...

295
00:24:26,126 --> 00:24:28,128
I used to make you happy.

296
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:34,301
Well, I can't be that person
if I'm not doing what I do.

297
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:38,930
I am a pilot and I'm not flying.

298
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:41,600
- Tom.
- Just...

299
00:24:44,269 --> 00:24:48,148
I don't know what it is that I am doing,
but it's not flying.

300
00:25:08,543 --> 00:25:09,586
Hey, Major.

301
00:25:11,338 --> 00:25:12,839
How's the war on terror going?

302
00:25:13,506 --> 00:25:15,175
Kind of like your war on drugs.

303
00:25:17,969 --> 00:25:20,513
Yeah. Drive safe.

304
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,744
Nothing explodes quite like explosives.

305
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:45,246
One IED factory going out of business.

306
00:25:46,957 --> 00:25:50,418
Soon as he comes back from taking
the last piss of his life, we smoke him.

307
00:25:51,252 --> 00:25:53,421
We are cleared hot. Light 'em up.

308
00:25:53,505 --> 00:25:55,006
Warheads on foreheads.

309
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:59,552
Damn it. Damn it, I lost the link.

310
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,263
The Reaper's on autopilot.

311
00:26:02,347 --> 00:26:05,433
Reaper on automatic holding pattern,
figure eight, deconflicted altitude.

312
00:26:05,517 --> 00:26:08,561
- Get it back.
- I am trying.

313
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:13,566
All right, I've got it. We're back on.

314
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,151
Laser on.

315
00:26:16,778 --> 00:26:17,779
Painting the target.

316
00:26:22,158 --> 00:26:23,410
Both Hellfires.

317
00:26:23,535 --> 00:26:27,497
<i>I've got two tickets to paradise</i>

318
00:26:27,706 --> 00:26:31,084
<i>Won't you pack your bags
We leave tonight...</i>

319
00:26:32,544 --> 00:26:35,505
Master arm on. Weapon's hot.

320
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:37,173
Rifle when ready.

321
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:40,969
Three, two, one, rifle.

322
00:26:41,386 --> 00:26:42,679
Missiles off the rail.

323
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:46,433
God damn it, what's that?

324
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:48,643
- Shit.
- Time of flight?

325
00:26:48,727 --> 00:26:50,687
- Seven seconds.
- Abort?

326
00:26:51,521 --> 00:26:53,148
Negative. Impact, three seconds.

327
00:26:53,231 --> 00:26:56,609
Run, you little shits! Get the fuck...

328
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,911
Where are they?

329
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,641
Master arm off.

330
00:27:30,643 --> 00:27:32,228
Weapon's safe.

331
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:50,413
I know what you're thinking.

332
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:53,958
I must have been a fucking pilot
before Pontius.

333
00:28:01,257 --> 00:28:03,051
You religious, Major?

334
00:28:06,304 --> 00:28:07,347
You never cuss.

335
00:28:08,515 --> 00:28:11,684
Yeah, I don't think it helps.
I'd do it if I thought it helped.

336
00:28:12,143 --> 00:28:15,480
Maybe it's something I picked up flying.
You know, actually flying.

337
00:28:16,481 --> 00:28:19,192
Yeah, not a lot of hotheads
stay up in the sky.

338
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:21,736
And those who make it
through flight school

339
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,987
generally owe us for an F-16.

340
00:28:26,533 --> 00:28:28,118
I owe us for a Phantom.

341
00:28:34,707 --> 00:28:36,417
So how are things at home?

342
00:28:40,296 --> 00:28:41,631
Can't complain.

343
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:46,344
Well, that's the thing, isn't it?
I mean, we really can't complain.

344
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,931
I mean, try telling our sob story
to the grunts on the ground.

345
00:28:50,932 --> 00:28:52,433
I mean, shit, they already thought
we were candy-asses

346
00:28:52,517 --> 00:28:54,517
when we were up in the air
with our fucking planes.

347
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:58,148
No. No one's throwing
a pity party for us.

348
00:29:00,441 --> 00:29:02,819
You just gotta keep compartmentalizing.

349
00:29:04,737 --> 00:29:07,407
Never mind the compartments
got too close.

350
00:29:09,868 --> 00:29:11,286
I mean, it used to be
we go to war with a country,

351
00:29:11,369 --> 00:29:13,621
we'd actually go to the country.

352
00:29:13,705 --> 00:29:16,499
Guys enlisted to see the world,
get some foreign tail.

353
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,212
It's better when we were deployed.

354
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,883
You know, there was war
and there was...

355
00:29:29,721 --> 00:29:32,015
You know you're not to blame for that.

356
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:34,893
The kids.

357
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:39,063
Wrong place, wrong time.

358
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:41,274
It happens.

359
00:29:42,108 --> 00:29:44,152
Well, it happens.

360
00:29:51,576 --> 00:29:54,662
We all pulled the trigger
in that box, Tommy.

361
00:29:54,746 --> 00:29:55,997
All of us.

362
00:29:57,582 --> 00:29:59,876
Thank you for saying that, sir,

363
00:30:01,544 --> 00:30:03,213
but we both know I pulled the trigger.

364
00:30:08,426 --> 00:30:09,844
Well, you wanna know
how I think about it?

365
00:30:09,928 --> 00:30:11,846
And here's how I think about it.

366
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:16,768
Just now, we didn't know
those kids were gonna show up.

367
00:30:19,103 --> 00:30:22,023
But they knew. They knew for a fact

368
00:30:22,106 --> 00:30:24,984
there were kids on those 767s
they flew into the Twin Towers.

369
00:30:25,068 --> 00:30:27,820
They had to walk past those kids
to get into the cockpits.

370
00:30:32,742 --> 00:30:34,869
Anyhow, I don't want you
getting gun shy on me.

371
00:30:38,122 --> 00:30:39,457
Take the day off.

372
00:30:41,376 --> 00:30:43,127
I think you get to use a little I&I.

373
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:46,339
Intoxication and intercourse.

374
00:30:47,298 --> 00:30:48,591
Right.

375
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:59,477
Why do we wear our flight suits, sir?

376
00:31:52,363 --> 00:31:54,324
What's this about, Drier?

377
00:31:58,369 --> 00:32:01,539
- Drier!
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

378
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:06,502
It doesn't feel like a medal ceremony.

379
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:12,050
Sit down.

380
00:32:13,968 --> 00:32:15,970
So word has come down from on high

381
00:32:16,054 --> 00:32:18,056
that, for an unspecified
number of missions,

382
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:19,849
we are to serve another master.

383
00:32:20,892 --> 00:32:22,352
Christians in Action.

384
00:32:24,771 --> 00:32:25,772
The CIA.

385
00:32:26,939 --> 00:32:28,191
- Thank you, sir.
- All right.

386
00:32:28,274 --> 00:32:31,319
- We're taking orders from the CIA?
- Yeah, you're damn straight, Christie.

387
00:32:31,402 --> 00:32:34,405
The CIA takes orders
from the administration,

388
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:36,824
and since we've sworn an oath to obey
that same administration,

389
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:39,869
and as much as it pains me
to take orders from a fucking clerk,

390
00:32:40,578 --> 00:32:42,997
yeah, we're taking orders from the CIA.

391
00:32:44,499 --> 00:32:47,335
Now what I want you
to prepare yourselves for is,

392
00:32:48,294 --> 00:32:51,339
the folks in Virginia
operate under a different set of ROEs.

393
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:55,510
They've progressed from what
they like to call a "personality strike",

394
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:58,054
where we know for sure
our target is a fucking bad guy.

395
00:32:58,638 --> 00:33:01,118
Now they come up with something
they call a "signature strike."

396
00:33:02,725 --> 00:33:04,060
Now what that fucking means is

397
00:33:04,143 --> 00:33:06,312
it's a hit based
not on a suspicion of guilt,

398
00:33:06,396 --> 00:33:08,439
but on a pattern of behavior.

399
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:12,777
So you may be called upon to fire at
any dumb shleb in Waziristan

400
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,196
who's carrying an AK-47,
even though we all know

401
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,075
that everyone and their mother
in Waziristan carries an AK-47.

402
00:33:19,158 --> 00:33:20,743
What about their right to bear arms?

403
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:26,707
I got my own personal opinions

404
00:33:26,791 --> 00:33:29,085
as to why there's been
an expansion of our mission,

405
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:31,504
which I should probably keep to myself.

406
00:33:33,548 --> 00:33:35,049
But what the fuck.

407
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:41,222
It's a lot easier to kill these people
than to capture them.

408
00:33:41,305 --> 00:33:44,142
Well, it makes sense, sir. If we
capture them, we have to torture them.

409
00:33:48,312 --> 00:33:49,313
Sorry, sir.

410
00:33:50,481 --> 00:33:52,650
Well, there is the inconvenient matter
of GTMO.

411
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:56,404
But it's really about the cost
in "blood and treasure"

412
00:33:56,487 --> 00:33:59,532
as those D.C. hypocrites,
who never pay in either, like to say.

413
00:33:59,615 --> 00:34:02,118
They know that if we try to
capture them instead of kill them,

414
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:04,245
we risk getting killed
or captured ourselves.

415
00:34:04,328 --> 00:34:07,415
And the public
is tired of watching coffins

416
00:34:07,498 --> 00:34:09,041
roll down airplane conveyer belts.

417
00:34:09,125 --> 00:34:13,004
And the Pentagon is embarrassed
by those videos on Al Jazeera,

418
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:15,840
where some marine denounces America

419
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:19,677
right before his head's liberated
from his shoulders, so...

420
00:34:21,596 --> 00:34:23,431
In many minds,
out of all the bad options,

421
00:34:23,514 --> 00:34:24,974
we're the least bad.

422
00:34:27,894 --> 00:34:30,062
Don't ask me if it's a just war.

423
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,567
That's not up to us.

424
00:34:37,487 --> 00:34:39,071
To us, it's just war.

425
00:34:41,616 --> 00:34:45,453
Tommy, you take the lead.
Ed, you're backup.

426
00:34:45,536 --> 00:34:46,746
And you get to take over

427
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:49,248
Tommy's highly-coveted
Kahili surveillance assignment.

428
00:34:52,043 --> 00:34:53,044
All right.

429
00:34:56,672 --> 00:34:59,300
- Let's go to Afghanistan.
- Fly and fry.

430
00:35:05,932 --> 00:35:09,936
Just between us, the Air Force
is making a play with the Pentagon

431
00:35:10,478 --> 00:35:12,772
to run the whole unmanned show.

432
00:35:13,231 --> 00:35:15,691
And they just don't want any

433
00:35:15,775 --> 00:35:19,153
static running missions for the spooks.

434
00:35:20,988 --> 00:35:23,157
And I've always been able
to count on you, Tommy.

435
00:35:24,617 --> 00:35:26,827
You can count on me now, sir.

436
00:35:28,287 --> 00:35:30,289
I take my orders from you.

437
00:35:46,556 --> 00:35:48,057
This is Johns.

438
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:51,269
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Johns.</i>

439
00:35:51,435 --> 00:35:55,106
<i>Out of all UAV crews
in the 61st Attack Squadron,</i>

440
00:35:55,273 --> 00:35:59,694
<i>Crew 3-2 has been selected
to conduct special operations</i>

441
00:35:59,777 --> 00:36:01,195
<i>in the war on terror.</i>

442
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:06,242
<i>For reasons of security,
all missions you carry out on our behalf,</i>

443
00:36:06,325 --> 00:36:08,494
<i>effectively never occurred.</i>

444
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:14,625
<i>You may refer to us simply as Langley.</i>

445
00:36:16,877 --> 00:36:19,213
We're over your
designated position, Langley.

446
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:21,173
We have eyes on the dwelling.

447
00:36:21,257 --> 00:36:22,925
<i>We see what you see.</i>

448
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:25,886
<i>The target is Abu al-Mahid.</i>

449
00:36:26,137 --> 00:36:29,974
<i>He attempts to vary his routine,
constantly changes locations.</i>

450
00:36:30,057 --> 00:36:32,727
<i>Never sleeps in the same house
two nights in a row.</i>

451
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,146
<i>But we've discerned a pattern
to his behavior.</i>

452
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:37,398
<i>According to our observations,</i>

453
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:40,818
<i>he's due at this structure
in east Herat at 0900.</i>

454
00:36:40,943 --> 00:36:43,362
Sir, they don't look like Taliban.

455
00:36:43,446 --> 00:36:45,781
Well, maybe if they had the guts
to wear uniforms.

456
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:48,105
<i>- There's</i> a <i>question, Langley...
- We heard the question.</i>

457
00:36:48,993 --> 00:36:51,329
<i>We have solid intelligence
from an informant.</i>

458
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:54,832
- A paid informant?
- A <i>reliable</i> informant.

459
00:36:54,957 --> 00:36:57,835
Well, he's not that reliable.
The target's late.

460
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,503
A vehicle approaching from the north.

461
00:37:00,838 --> 00:37:04,133
<i>Protocol requires us
to positively identify the target.</i>

462
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,267
<i>- Is that him?
- We 're conferring.</i>

463
00:37:18,481 --> 00:37:22,318
<i>We can confirm. Target qualifies.
Permission to prosecute.</i>

464
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:25,446
We're obliged to point out, Langley,

465
00:37:25,529 --> 00:37:28,532
we've observed noncombatants
in and around the dwelling.

466
00:37:30,493 --> 00:37:35,915
<i>Colonel Johns, no one regrets the loss
of innocent life more than we do.</i>

467
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:39,585
<i>We take inordinate care
not to use lethal force</i>

468
00:37:39,669 --> 00:37:41,796
<i>where there are women and children.</i>

469
00:37:41,879 --> 00:37:46,467
<i>Unfortunately, many of our targets
cynically use women and children</i>

470
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:48,678
<i>as shields to discourage attack.</i>

471
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:52,181
<i>We have to constantly weigh
the risk to their lives</i>

472
00:37:52,264 --> 00:37:55,601
<i>against the threat posed
to U.S. interests.</i>

473
00:37:55,685 --> 00:37:57,186
<i>Please engage.</i>

474
00:38:01,899 --> 00:38:04,485
It's just there's high winds, sir.
Heavy turbulence.

475
00:38:04,568 --> 00:38:07,655
We're getting tossed around pretty bad,
Langley. It's tough to make a clean hit.

476
00:38:07,738 --> 00:38:10,991
<i>We trust you appreciate
that this is a high-value target.</i>

477
00:38:11,158 --> 00:38:12,326
<i>Please take the shot.</i>

478
00:38:13,244 --> 00:38:15,871
<i>Rifle when ready. You're cleared hot.</i>

479
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,220
Tommy, can you keep her
in a straight line?

480
00:38:21,585 --> 00:38:24,338
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

481
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:29,385
Three, two, one, rifle.

482
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,680
Weapon's away.
Time of flight, eight seconds.

483
00:38:43,816 --> 00:38:45,025
Splash.

484
00:38:45,943 --> 00:38:47,278
Good kill.

485
00:38:47,611 --> 00:38:50,239
Master arm off, weapon's safe.

486
00:38:51,115 --> 00:38:52,324
Laser safe.

487
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,452
<i>Our compliments, Colonel.</i>

488
00:38:55,077 --> 00:38:57,204
<i>That was a high card
you and your people</i>

489
00:38:57,288 --> 00:38:59,248
<i>just pulled out of the deck.</i>

490
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:03,335
<i>Al-Qaeda's number one bomb maker
will never again harm one of us.</i>

491
00:39:07,173 --> 00:39:08,966
<i>Please do a follow-up.</i>

492
00:39:12,136 --> 00:39:14,805
Did I hear you correctly, Langley?

493
00:39:16,098 --> 00:39:18,434
<i>There are other combatants
in the vicinity.</i>

494
00:39:19,977 --> 00:39:21,061
Double tap?

495
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:23,355
<i>We prefer the term "follow-up."</i>

496
00:39:23,481 --> 00:39:24,607
Sir...

497
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:29,028
They are rescuers. We can't...

498
00:39:29,111 --> 00:39:30,511
The fuck we can't. They're Taliban.

499
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:32,990
Who do you think the first responders
are gonna be, Quakers?

500
00:39:33,783 --> 00:39:35,785
Those rescuers have RPGs.

501
00:39:39,163 --> 00:39:43,250
- I see people with shovels.
- Then just hit the ones with the RPGs.

502
00:39:48,214 --> 00:39:50,424
Can you confirm that order, Langley?

503
00:39:50,508 --> 00:39:53,260
<i>In our opinion, it's proportionate.</i>

504
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:57,348
Sir, forgive me, sir.
What the hell does that mean?

505
00:39:57,431 --> 00:40:01,060
<i>It means that in our assessment,
the combatants we are targeting</i>

506
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:04,104
<i>pose a grave-enough threat
to the United States</i>

507
00:40:04,188 --> 00:40:07,441
<i>to justify potential civilian casualties.</i>

508
00:40:07,525 --> 00:40:11,904
<i>Not to mention that this pre-emptive
self-defense is approved and ordered</i>

509
00:40:11,987 --> 00:40:13,906
<i>by the administration.</i>

510
00:40:14,031 --> 00:40:15,574
<i>Please engage.</i>

511
00:40:16,784 --> 00:40:17,993
Orders.

512
00:40:26,335 --> 00:40:29,171
- Laser.
- Lasing.

513
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,301
Master arm on. Weapon's hot.

514
00:40:39,598 --> 00:40:42,560
Three, two, one, rifle.

515
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:46,230
Weapon's away.
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

516
00:41:04,582 --> 00:41:07,585
Master arm off.

517
00:41:15,509 --> 00:41:17,469
<i>The subject on the left,</i>

518
00:41:19,096 --> 00:41:20,764
<i>what is she doing?</i>

519
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,019
I believe she's picking
an arm off a tree, sir.

520
00:41:27,688 --> 00:41:29,982
Would they like me to do
further damage assessment?

521
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:34,278
Hand it off, Tommy.

522
00:41:34,945 --> 00:41:37,281
Captain Christie, take the controls.

523
00:41:46,123 --> 00:41:49,293
Damage assessment, estimate, 12.

524
00:41:52,046 --> 00:41:53,839
Well, we count...

525
00:41:54,548 --> 00:41:56,383
Twelve dead, Langley.

526
00:41:56,467 --> 00:41:57,968
Give or take.

527
00:41:59,553 --> 00:42:01,972
<i>We concur. Signing off.</i>

528
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:07,561
Was that a war crime, sir?

529
00:42:07,645 --> 00:42:09,647
Shut the fuck up, Suarez.

530
00:42:10,272 --> 00:42:13,233
How'd they decide
the condolence payment is five K?

531
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:15,486
Sounds like a lot to me.

532
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:18,113
You could live there on,
like, a dollar a day.

533
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:23,410
What was that shit?

534
00:42:25,829 --> 00:42:27,498
I didn't sign up for that shit.

535
00:42:28,207 --> 00:42:30,709
That's what terrorists do.
You know that, right?

536
00:42:31,752 --> 00:42:35,005
Plant a second bomb, blow up soldiers
showing up for the first bomb.

537
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:37,967
Since when did we become Hamas?

538
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:44,098
"Approved by the administration."

539
00:42:45,641 --> 00:42:47,559
They give Nobel Peace Prizes
for this now?

540
00:42:47,643 --> 00:42:48,978
They sure do.

541
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:53,482
You wanna talk about all the shots
we didn't take,

542
00:42:53,524 --> 00:42:56,110
waiting for some D.C. lawyer
to come back from lunch?

543
00:42:57,987 --> 00:43:00,280
- No wonder they hate us.
- They always hated us.

544
00:43:00,364 --> 00:43:04,118
We're always gonna be the great Satan
because we got Hustler and Hooters,

545
00:43:04,201 --> 00:43:05,953
and we let women drive
and go to school.

546
00:43:06,036 --> 00:43:08,330
And they're not gonna stop hating us
until the savages

547
00:43:08,414 --> 00:43:10,958
have Sharia law everywhere
on the goddamn planet.

548
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,585
You think you'd have this job
if you were over there?

549
00:43:13,669 --> 00:43:15,671
- Do you think you'd have any job?
- There were kids!

550
00:43:15,754 --> 00:43:17,339
Not our fault. They shouldn't
bring kids into a war zone.

551
00:43:17,423 --> 00:43:18,465
They live there!

552
00:43:18,549 --> 00:43:20,801
Did you get the wrong address, Suarez?

553
00:43:21,552 --> 00:43:24,471
Look around you.
This is a military base. It's what we do.

554
00:43:24,722 --> 00:43:26,765
We're fighting a war
and we're winning it.

555
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:28,308
They bomb New York lately?

556
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:32,771
We're saving American lives.
So, fucking sue me.

557
00:43:37,443 --> 00:43:38,569
God is great.

558
00:43:39,737 --> 00:43:41,071
Later, Jane Fonda.

559
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:44,616
You're a fucking idiot, Zimmer.
No offense.

560
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,869
Actually, offense.

561
00:43:49,621 --> 00:43:51,415
What do you think, sir?

562
00:43:52,082 --> 00:43:54,752
- Those are the orders.
- Yeah.

563
00:43:58,088 --> 00:43:59,715
At least it doesn't give you a hard-on.

564
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:04,261
Sorry, sir, I could just...
I could kill Zimmer.

565
00:44:06,096 --> 00:44:07,931
Death Junkie Christie.

566
00:44:10,601 --> 00:44:12,269
We should go out on the town.

567
00:44:17,858 --> 00:44:19,401
You know, just our crew.

568
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:23,697
So we don't end up killing each other
in that goddamn sweatbox.

569
00:44:32,289 --> 00:44:33,332
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi, Daddy!

570
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:34,541
Hey.

571
00:44:34,625 --> 00:44:36,293
All right, come on. Get in the car.

572
00:44:37,586 --> 00:44:38,754
No pushing.

573
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:49,056
What's the Pythagorean theorem?

574
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:53,185
The square of the hypotenuse
is equal to the sum

575
00:44:53,268 --> 00:44:56,313
of the squares on the other two sides.

576
00:44:56,396 --> 00:44:58,023
There you go. Nicely done.

577
00:45:00,359 --> 00:45:02,444
Did you really need to know
all this to be a pilot?

578
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:04,988
Absolutely not.
They said I did, but I didn't.

579
00:45:05,155 --> 00:45:07,032
Still, it's good to know it anyway.

580
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:30,139
The truck's making that noise again.

581
00:45:31,849 --> 00:45:33,725
I'm gonna need to take it to the shop.

582
00:45:33,809 --> 00:45:37,771
All right, well, I'll take a look at it.
Those guys will rip you off.

583
00:45:37,938 --> 00:45:39,022
Okay.

584
00:45:59,126 --> 00:46:00,752
To Crew 3-2.

585
00:46:06,508 --> 00:46:07,718
Fucking Vegas.

586
00:46:09,428 --> 00:46:11,388
You wanna see how civilization ends,
come here.

587
00:46:12,055 --> 00:46:16,935
Caesars Palace, New York-New York,
Paris, The Venetian, Monte Carlo...

588
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:20,063
- What's the goddamn pyramid?
- Luxor.

589
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:22,524
No wonder fuck-all Americans
got a passport.

590
00:46:23,066 --> 00:46:24,860
They think the world's all here.

591
00:46:25,485 --> 00:46:26,778
End of civilization.

592
00:46:28,071 --> 00:46:31,033
Who's up for a lap dance, huh?
I'm paying.

593
00:46:31,116 --> 00:46:33,452
- Really?
- No, I'm not.

594
00:46:34,077 --> 00:46:35,162
Dick.

595
00:46:47,341 --> 00:46:48,821
You and your wife
from somewhere else?

596
00:46:49,927 --> 00:46:52,638
I've never met anyone in Vegas
that actually comes from here.

597
00:46:52,721 --> 00:46:54,681
Well, she does.

598
00:46:54,765 --> 00:46:56,683
I met her when she was working
at the Tropicana

599
00:46:56,767 --> 00:47:00,229
about a year before I shipped out
to the sandbox, my last tour.

600
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:05,567
First date, I took her flying in an F-16.

601
00:47:06,443 --> 00:47:07,861
- That'll work.
- Yeah.

602
00:47:07,945 --> 00:47:11,365
She thought I was exciting
in a boring kind of way.

603
00:47:11,448 --> 00:47:15,244
And a part of her just liked
Uncle's paychecks every 15 days.

604
00:47:16,453 --> 00:47:17,996
What about you?

605
00:47:18,747 --> 00:47:21,833
Battlefields and blackjack?
Still every girl's dream?

606
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:23,710
I don't know.

607
00:47:27,798 --> 00:47:29,549
How bad do you miss it?

608
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,512
Flying.

609
00:47:36,139 --> 00:47:37,599
I miss the fear.

610
00:47:38,976 --> 00:47:42,104
You're up in the sky,
something can happen.

611
00:47:42,938 --> 00:47:44,731
There's a risk, you know?

612
00:47:44,815 --> 00:47:50,112
I mean, try landing on a carrier
at night or in rough seas,

613
00:47:50,487 --> 00:47:53,490
the deck's pitching 30 feet, low fuel.

614
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:58,412
We've got no skin in the game.

615
00:47:59,955 --> 00:48:03,292
I feel like a coward every day.

616
00:48:04,334 --> 00:48:09,256
Taking pot shots from half a world away
in an air-conditioned cubicle.

617
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:14,052
I mean, they get lucky, they shoot
my plane down. I'm not even in it.

618
00:48:14,136 --> 00:48:16,221
All we got to do is
pull another one out of the box.

619
00:48:17,681 --> 00:48:21,810
Worst thing that can happen to me is
carpal tunnel or I spill coffee in my lap.

620
00:48:22,185 --> 00:48:26,356
The most dangerous thing I do
is drive home on the freeway.

621
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,323
Yeah, I get the feeling
I'm gonna die of boredom.

622
00:48:42,914 --> 00:48:46,585
Well, I'm gonna try my luck.

623
00:48:47,419 --> 00:48:49,171
Yeah. All right.

624
00:48:51,715 --> 00:48:52,758
<i>You'?</i>

625
00:48:54,134 --> 00:48:56,303
No, I'd better get going. I got...

626
00:49:01,224 --> 00:49:02,225
Okay.

627
00:49:03,393 --> 00:49:05,062
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

628
00:49:32,089 --> 00:49:33,090
Fuck.

629
00:49:40,597 --> 00:49:42,224
- Major.
- Yeah.

630
00:49:43,392 --> 00:49:46,103
You in a hurry?
You might want to throttle back.

631
00:49:47,437 --> 00:49:48,647
Yeah, no, I was...

632
00:49:49,398 --> 00:49:50,732
Yeah, I don't know.

633
00:49:58,949 --> 00:50:00,075
Listen, Major...

634
00:50:02,953 --> 00:50:04,287
I'm a vet.

635
00:50:12,129 --> 00:50:13,797
I'll let it slide this one time.

636
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,967
Come on, I'll get you home safe.

637
00:50:28,437 --> 00:50:30,856
Hey, Jesse, what are you doing awake?

638
00:50:30,939 --> 00:50:32,190
I'm thinking.

639
00:50:32,983 --> 00:50:34,317
Well, what you thinking about?

640
00:50:34,734 --> 00:50:37,362
- Everything.
- Well, that's a lot to be thinking about.

641
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:39,823
Why don't you try
just thinking about sleeping?

642
00:50:39,906 --> 00:50:41,658
I'll do that.

643
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:43,160
Good night, Daddy.

644
00:51:27,537 --> 00:51:29,539
We made the papers again.

645
00:51:32,459 --> 00:51:36,087
Ever notice when they burn Old Glory,
their flags are always homemade?

646
00:51:36,713 --> 00:51:38,994
For some reason, they don't stock
the Star-Spangled Banner

647
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:40,967
in those Pashtun bazaars. No.

648
00:51:42,093 --> 00:51:45,680
Somebody had to paint
these 50 stars and 13 bars by hand.

649
00:51:45,764 --> 00:51:46,924
They had to do it just right.

650
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:52,020
So we definitely know it's us
that's got them so upset.

651
00:51:55,232 --> 00:51:58,360
Like some guy stayed up all night
making that symbol of

652
00:51:58,443 --> 00:52:01,071
evil American imperialism
just as good as he can.

653
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,992
A lot of love went into that hate.

654
00:52:08,370 --> 00:52:10,163
I've never been to Yemen, sir.

655
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,167
If I were you, I'd keep it that way.

656
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:25,637
This is Johns. We're over
your requested position, Langley.

657
00:52:25,762 --> 00:52:29,015
These are the coordinates
for Al-Bayda province, South Yemen.

658
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:31,351
<i>Good afternoon,
Lieutenant Colonel Johns.</i>

659
00:52:31,434 --> 00:52:34,271
Last time I checked, Langley,
we're not at war with Yemen.

660
00:52:35,897 --> 00:52:39,317
<i>While we respect state sovereignty
and the rule of law, Colonel,</i>

661
00:52:39,442 --> 00:52:42,028
<i>we're regrettably facing
a substate adversary</i>

662
00:52:42,112 --> 00:52:43,655
<i>who abides by no rules.</i>

663
00:52:44,155 --> 00:52:47,909
<i>Out of necessity, this war on terror
has become borderless.</i>

664
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:52,080
<i>The target is the Al-Qaeda cell
gathered by the market.</i>

665
00:52:57,294 --> 00:52:58,420
We see the crowd.

666
00:53:03,466 --> 00:53:05,302
You want us to kill a crowd?

667
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:09,514
<i>Al-Qaeda unsurprisingly,
tend to congregate with Al-Qaeda</i>

668
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:11,474
<i>or associated forces.</i>

669
00:53:12,475 --> 00:53:16,271
<i>Consequently, we've determined
that it is militarily more effective</i>

670
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:19,107
<i>to eliminate a group than an individual.</i>

671
00:53:31,411 --> 00:53:33,246
Does that include the underage boy, sir?

672
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:37,167
<i>Our analysts see only
military age males.</i>

673
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:42,505
<i>In our assessment, this Al-Qaeda cell
represents an imminent threat.</i>

674
00:53:44,341 --> 00:53:46,384
<i>Permission to prosecute.</i>

675
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,303
<i>Please cease recording.</i>

676
00:54:00,690 --> 00:54:03,652
- Laser.
- Lasing.

677
00:54:03,735 --> 00:54:06,863
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

678
00:54:08,323 --> 00:54:11,201
Three, two, one...

679
00:54:12,202 --> 00:54:13,662
Rifle.

680
00:54:14,746 --> 00:54:17,290
Missiles away. Time of flight,

681
00:54:18,249 --> 00:54:19,626
ten seconds.

682
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,395
Like fish in a fucking barrel.

683
00:54:39,521 --> 00:54:43,483
<i>It is a sad fact that
war is often asymmetrical.</i>

684
00:54:44,025 --> 00:54:47,404
<i>Please forego damage assessment
and exit the airspace.</i>

685
00:54:54,411 --> 00:54:56,705
Master arm off, weapon's safe.

686
00:54:56,913 --> 00:54:58,123
Laser's safe.

687
00:55:09,342 --> 00:55:12,220
"Imminent threat"? They couldn't live
any further away from us.

688
00:55:13,012 --> 00:55:15,932
- Poorest fucking place on earth.
- Setting the course for Djibouti.

689
00:55:16,266 --> 00:55:18,101
It depends on
your definition of imminent.

690
00:55:20,311 --> 00:55:22,105
Actually, you're right about that.

691
00:55:23,064 --> 00:55:24,190
- I am?
- Yeah.

692
00:55:24,274 --> 00:55:27,193
Take a while for that boy to get big
enough to hold a Kalashnikov.

693
00:55:27,277 --> 00:55:30,822
But no question, we are a regular
fucking terrorist factory.

694
00:55:31,114 --> 00:55:33,616
Best recruitment tool
Al-Qaeda ever had.

695
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,540
We can kill them faster
than they can make 'em.

696
00:55:35,618 --> 00:55:37,899
Fuck you, Zimmer.
You'd better pray they never get drones.

697
00:55:37,954 --> 00:55:39,514
They're not gonna
waste money on a drone

698
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:41,708
when they can strap a bomb to a kid.

699
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:44,210
Did you know the Times Square bomber
was trained in Yemen?

700
00:55:44,294 --> 00:55:46,379
Not very well. It didn't go off.

701
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:47,505
Asshole.

702
00:55:47,797 --> 00:55:51,217
The reason he tried to blow us up

703
00:55:51,301 --> 00:55:52,886
was drone strikes.

704
00:55:52,969 --> 00:55:56,097
So obviously we should keep on
hitting them with drone strikes, right?

705
00:55:56,765 --> 00:55:57,807
Yes.

706
00:56:02,103 --> 00:56:03,855
Prepare to hand off.

707
00:56:13,865 --> 00:56:15,033
- Hey, man.
- Hey, Zack.

708
00:56:22,999 --> 00:56:24,834
Major, we got a customer.

709
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:29,005
- You're the only available crew.
- What is it?

710
00:56:29,714 --> 00:56:31,841
Overwatch. One-Six.

711
00:57:00,578 --> 00:57:02,956
Warhorse Six, this is Deadly Four-One.

712
00:57:04,040 --> 00:57:05,792
<i>Deadly Four-One,</i>

713
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:08,962
<i>my men need some shuteye.
Can you watch our backs?</i>

714
00:57:09,045 --> 00:57:13,383
<i>Make sure we don't get
any uninvited guests till 0600?</i>

715
00:57:14,384 --> 00:57:16,052
That's an affirmative, Warhorse Six.

716
00:57:16,928 --> 00:57:19,556
I got fuel for six hours.

717
00:57:21,558 --> 00:57:23,351
There's nothing close to your position.

718
00:57:24,978 --> 00:57:27,397
<i>Roger that. Nice to hear.</i>

719
00:57:29,232 --> 00:57:30,400
Sleep tight.

720
00:57:33,653 --> 00:57:35,363
<i>Copy. Out.</i>

721
00:58:36,299 --> 00:58:37,508
Warhorse Six...

722
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:43,139
This is Deadly Four-One.

723
00:58:44,724 --> 00:58:46,935
And this is your wake up call.

724
00:58:51,147 --> 00:58:54,859
<i>Roger that, Deadly Four-One.
We owe you.</i>

725
00:59:14,837 --> 00:59:16,506
Your appointment today...

726
00:59:18,716 --> 00:59:20,510
Was it life or death?

727
00:59:22,512 --> 00:59:24,180
Because mine was.

728
00:59:27,016 --> 00:59:28,351
That's cheap.

729
00:59:31,688 --> 00:59:33,189
You're right.

730
00:59:36,025 --> 00:59:37,527
I'm sorry.

731
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:42,323
What was your appointment?

732
00:59:42,407 --> 00:59:45,868
If you must know,
I was going to go to a class at the gym.

733
00:59:46,494 --> 00:59:49,122
I was trying to stay in shape
in case I go back to dancing.

734
00:59:50,123 --> 00:59:51,708
Chorus like we talked about.

735
00:59:54,043 --> 00:59:55,712
I blew 50 bucks not going.

736
00:59:56,379 --> 00:59:59,007
I'm sorry.
I'll try to make soccer tomorrow.

737
00:59:59,549 --> 01:00:01,426
I will, Molly.

738
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,807
I did something good today.

739
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:11,811
You don't always?

740
01:00:15,273 --> 01:00:17,400
Let me make it up to you.

741
01:00:48,222 --> 01:00:49,682
Prepare to hand off.

742
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:53,300
There's a man in Langley
who wants to borrow your plane.

743
01:00:54,479 --> 01:00:55,772
Handing off.

744
01:00:59,442 --> 01:01:03,362
Must be nice, Egan.
Hand-picked by the spooks,

745
01:01:03,446 --> 01:01:04,530
getting all the plum assignments.

746
01:01:04,614 --> 01:01:06,115
Is that what they are?

747
01:01:06,449 --> 01:01:09,869
Better than circling that compound like
some two-bit detective on a stakeout.

748
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:13,748
- What's going on there?
- Nothing. That's the point.

749
01:01:13,831 --> 01:01:16,292
No, no, no. Right there. There.

750
01:01:17,668 --> 01:01:18,836
Same guy.

751
01:01:20,171 --> 01:01:21,255
Yup.

752
01:01:45,947 --> 01:01:47,281
He's a bad guy.

753
01:01:48,616 --> 01:01:50,660
He's just not our bad guy.

754
01:02:03,256 --> 01:02:04,674
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

755
01:02:13,891 --> 01:02:15,685
What's she doing now?

756
01:02:17,854 --> 01:02:19,522
She's going back to work.

757
01:02:29,031 --> 01:02:30,616
Major, we got new co-ords
from Langley.

758
01:02:31,617 --> 01:02:33,077
Sending them to you now.

759
01:02:38,332 --> 01:02:40,877
You ever seen
how beautiful it is in Virginia?

760
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:44,297
It's green. It's not like here.

761
01:02:45,965 --> 01:02:50,052
You want to start a family,
crime in Virginia is non-existent.

762
01:02:51,721 --> 01:02:53,723
It's like heaven on earth.

763
01:03:18,331 --> 01:03:19,332
Hey.

764
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:29,425
You want to go somewhere today

765
01:03:29,508 --> 01:03:31,886
- and do something?
- Yeah?

766
01:03:33,763 --> 01:03:35,056
It's strange.

767
01:03:36,515 --> 01:03:39,352
Imagine growing up
praying for gray skies.

768
01:03:40,269 --> 01:03:42,772
They hate blue skies
'cause that's when we fly.

769
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:44,815
Gray skies, maybe not.

770
01:03:48,444 --> 01:03:49,779
Let's do something.

771
01:03:51,197 --> 01:03:52,615
Go to the strip...

772
01:03:54,116 --> 01:03:55,284
Or dancing?

773
01:04:07,129 --> 01:04:08,464
Splash.

774
01:04:10,174 --> 01:04:11,509
No, he's getting away.

775
01:04:24,438 --> 01:04:26,399
- Grenades.
- Withhold ordnance.

776
01:04:26,482 --> 01:04:28,693
They're not grenades,
Intelligence Coordinator Zimmer.

777
01:04:28,776 --> 01:04:30,152
They're fucking pomegranates.

778
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:35,700
<i>Thanks for the cover, Cyclops 8.</i>

779
01:04:35,783 --> 01:04:37,493
<i>How's the weather in Vegas?</i>

780
01:04:37,576 --> 01:04:39,954
Hotter than hell here, Bronco Two.

781
01:04:40,037 --> 01:04:41,831
<i>Happy to trade places.</i>

782
01:04:45,543 --> 01:04:47,670
Shit! Shit, what was that?

783
01:04:47,837 --> 01:04:50,131
LED. He stepped on an IED.

784
01:04:50,214 --> 01:04:52,633
Shoot back! Shoot something.

785
01:06:09,752 --> 01:06:12,421
<i>Hey, it's Molly. I'm not here.
Have a great day.</i>

786
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,091
Molly, call me back.

787
01:06:30,022 --> 01:06:32,191
He's using the fertilizer to grow things.

788
01:06:32,274 --> 01:06:35,403
The question is,
does he use it to kill things?

789
01:06:35,486 --> 01:06:38,781
And this is not
your usual Afghani cash crop.

790
01:06:39,448 --> 01:06:41,117
He's actually growing something to eat.

791
01:06:42,451 --> 01:06:44,537
<i>The traffic to and from the structure</i>

792
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,956
<i>indicates to us the presence
of a bomb factory.</i>

793
01:06:48,916 --> 01:06:50,167
<i>In our judgment,</i>

794
01:06:50,251 --> 01:06:52,211
<i>the greater risk is to do nothing.</i>

795
01:06:54,255 --> 01:06:55,423
Roger that, Langley.

796
01:06:57,800 --> 01:06:58,968
Major.

797
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:04,223
Major.

798
01:07:07,810 --> 01:07:10,563
- Yeah, laser on.
- It's lased, Major.

799
01:07:11,188 --> 01:07:13,983
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

800
01:07:14,191 --> 01:07:17,611
Three, two, one, rifle.

801
01:07:18,779 --> 01:07:21,407
Missile's away.
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

802
01:07:35,838 --> 01:07:37,131
Good kill.

803
01:07:47,516 --> 01:07:48,559
Hi.

804
01:07:50,936 --> 01:07:53,481
- I told you not to wait up.
- You drunk?

805
01:07:54,857 --> 01:07:56,233
That's rich coming from you.

806
01:07:56,317 --> 01:07:57,526
Where you been?

807
01:07:59,278 --> 01:08:01,489
I told you I was going out with the girls.

808
01:08:02,239 --> 01:08:03,657
What's wrong with you?

809
01:08:09,747 --> 01:08:12,166
Don't treat me like a damn fool.

810
01:08:13,542 --> 01:08:15,044
I saw you today...

811
01:08:16,837 --> 01:08:18,964
...in the truck with Danny.

812
01:08:19,048 --> 01:08:21,300
He was trying to work out
what's wrong with the truck.

813
01:08:23,052 --> 01:08:24,261
Because you never did.

814
01:08:26,639 --> 01:08:29,099
Plus I thought
it might be fun to blow him.

815
01:08:34,063 --> 01:08:35,689
I left you a message.

816
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:38,275
My phone died.

817
01:08:39,485 --> 01:08:40,903
I just got your messages.

818
01:08:41,529 --> 01:08:43,906
- Let me see your phone.
- No.

819
01:08:50,329 --> 01:08:51,622
Give me your phone.

820
01:09:02,383 --> 01:09:03,842
Why'd you change your password?

821
01:09:05,678 --> 01:09:07,513
Because the kids know it

822
01:09:07,596 --> 01:09:09,431
and they're always
fucking with my phone.

823
01:09:10,641 --> 01:09:11,684
Give me the new password.

824
01:09:12,685 --> 01:09:14,144
It's Tommy.

825
01:09:15,771 --> 01:09:16,855
Tommy.

826
01:09:24,905 --> 01:09:26,198
But I'll change that now.

827
01:09:32,454 --> 01:09:34,039
You think I'm having an affair.

828
01:09:38,043 --> 01:09:39,295
You know, I...

829
01:09:39,837 --> 01:09:41,630
I've thought about it.

830
01:09:43,132 --> 01:09:46,385
And you know what else,
I don't think it would even be cheating.

831
01:09:46,468 --> 01:09:49,013
Because to cheat on someone,
you'd have to be in a relationship.

832
01:09:50,306 --> 01:09:52,057
And I don't know that we are anymore.

833
01:09:52,141 --> 01:09:53,642
If that's what helps you.

834
01:09:54,643 --> 01:09:55,978
Bet that helps.

835
01:09:58,022 --> 01:09:59,607
What is this about?

836
01:09:59,690 --> 01:10:02,250
I mean, is this really just about you
losing a seat in the plane?

837
01:10:04,612 --> 01:10:06,905
'Cause here's your last piece
of truth for the day.

838
01:10:07,281 --> 01:10:09,700
Nobody is gonna put you back in one.

839
01:10:14,121 --> 01:10:16,165
But I wasn't the one
that drug you out of the fucking thing,

840
01:10:16,248 --> 01:10:18,167
so taking it out on me
isn't going to help.

841
01:10:20,419 --> 01:10:21,920
And you were right about one thing.

842
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,839
Yeah, what's that?

843
01:10:24,214 --> 01:10:26,884
At least when you were away,
you were really away.

844
01:10:26,967 --> 01:10:29,178
Now you're here, but fuck it.

845
01:10:31,013 --> 01:10:32,348
But what?

846
01:10:33,057 --> 01:10:36,685
What is it that you need so bad?
What is it that you miss so bad?

847
01:10:37,353 --> 01:10:39,897
Combat? You miss the fucking combat?

848
01:10:40,397 --> 01:10:42,983
Hit me. Hit me, you like that.

849
01:10:43,067 --> 01:10:45,736
- I hit you one time. Will you stop?
- Come on, you little bitch! Hit me.

850
01:10:45,819 --> 01:10:47,488
- Hit me, little bitch, hit me!
- Molly, don't do that!

851
01:10:47,571 --> 01:10:49,907
- Hit me!
- Molly. Molly! Just stop it, all right.

852
01:10:50,866 --> 01:10:54,703
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

853
01:10:57,748 --> 01:10:58,916
It's okay.

854
01:11:01,251 --> 01:11:02,378
Fuck!

855
01:13:05,501 --> 01:13:07,461

01:15:18,967 --> 01:15:20,302
You look miles away.

861
01:15:22,346 --> 01:15:23,555
Seven thousand.

862
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:30,854
You wanna know about my job?

863
01:15:32,481 --> 01:15:33,565
Yeah.

864
01:15:34,399 --> 01:15:35,609
Well...

865
01:15:37,486 --> 01:15:41,865
Yesterday, I was flying over a house
in South Waziristan.

866
01:15:45,118 --> 01:15:46,787
It was night when I started watching

867
01:15:46,870 --> 01:15:49,122
but they couldn't see me
even if it was day.

868
01:15:52,501 --> 01:15:54,836
It was the house of
a Taliban commander.

869
01:15:56,338 --> 01:15:57,589
He wasn't home.

870
01:15:59,132 --> 01:16:02,094
Inside his wife and family were sleeping.

871
01:16:02,511 --> 01:16:06,515
When he did come back around dawn,
the family was still inside,

872
01:16:06,598 --> 01:16:09,476
but I wasn't sure
when I'd get this chance again so...

873
01:16:10,811 --> 01:16:12,813
I blew the house up anyway.

874
01:16:21,196 --> 01:16:22,239
And I watched

875
01:16:24,116 --> 01:16:26,868
as the neighbors started
pulling the bodies out.

876
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:33,834
Another one of my jobs
is damage assessment,

877
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:37,129
which is our way of saying
counting the dead,

878
01:16:37,212 --> 01:16:40,048
which is not as easy as it sounds.

879
01:16:41,174 --> 01:16:44,344
Because a lot of times the bodies
are in such small pieces.

880
01:16:45,887 --> 01:16:49,182
But this time, I knew for sure

881
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:51,727
it was seven.

882
01:16:53,395 --> 01:16:56,898
<i>I watched all morning
as these locals cleaned up the mess,</i>

883
01:16:57,941 --> 01:17:00,027
<i>got ready for the funeral.</i>

884
01:17:02,487 --> 01:17:05,032
<i>They like to bury their dead
within 24 hours.</i>

885
01:17:07,075 --> 01:17:10,787
Which is a happy coincidence for me

886
01:17:10,871 --> 01:17:13,373
because that's how long
I can stay in the air.

887
01:17:15,709 --> 01:17:17,252
I watched them

888
01:17:18,086 --> 01:17:21,339
carry the bodies
up a hill to the gravesite.

889
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,926
I had information
that the Taliban commander's brother

890
01:17:25,052 --> 01:17:26,720
<i>would attend the funeral.</i>

891
01:17:27,596 --> 01:17:30,599
<i>So, I waited</i>

892
01:17:31,725 --> 01:17:33,685
<i>till they were all there</i>

893
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,480
saying their prayers.

894
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:46,031
And then I blew them up, too.

895
01:18:13,225 --> 01:18:14,476
That's my job.

896
01:19:27,382 --> 01:19:28,633
Come inside.

897
01:19:30,385 --> 01:19:32,095
I need you to come inside.

898
01:19:34,472 --> 01:19:35,891
Get back in the house.

899
01:19:38,727 --> 01:19:41,563
It's so beautifully clear
when we watch them.

900
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:45,066
It couldn't be clearer if I was there.

901
01:19:47,611 --> 01:19:51,531
You can see everything,
the looks on their faces, everything.

902
01:19:53,742 --> 01:19:55,243
Tommy, please.

903
01:19:58,747 --> 01:20:00,415
Once you see it,

904
01:20:01,541 --> 01:20:03,001
how do you unsee it?

905
01:20:06,755 --> 01:20:08,173
You call in sick.

906
01:20:08,590 --> 01:20:10,091
You need help.

907
01:20:10,508 --> 01:20:12,260
You shouldn't be driving a car,
let alone...

908
01:20:12,344 --> 01:20:14,012
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

909
01:20:14,596 --> 01:20:16,806
- No, you can't go!
- I'm okay.

910
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:18,558
No!

911
01:21:09,317 --> 01:21:11,611
- Cutting it close.
- Yeah, well, I made it, didn't I?

912
01:21:13,405 --> 01:21:15,573
- Need some gum, sir?
- No.

913
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:21,496
No, you need some gum, sir.

914
01:21:31,172 --> 01:21:34,467
- Starting early. You okay?
- Yeah.

915
01:21:34,676 --> 01:21:35,969
Christie can cover for you.

916
01:21:39,097 --> 01:21:40,307
I'm fine.

917
01:21:45,812 --> 01:21:48,148
It's all right. Relax. Sit down.

918
01:21:52,986 --> 01:21:54,696
I know what you're all thinking.

919
01:21:56,197 --> 01:21:57,782
After what's gone on...

920
01:21:59,576 --> 01:22:02,662
I've been doing a little thinking myself,
believe it or not.

921
01:22:04,247 --> 01:22:06,958
And not too many of us are in love
with the tactics

922
01:22:07,042 --> 01:22:09,878
employed by our esteemed colleagues
in Langley, Virginia,

923
01:22:09,961 --> 01:22:11,588
but let me ask you all a question.

924
01:22:13,715 --> 01:22:16,468
They kill us and we kill them.

925
01:22:17,677 --> 01:22:20,972
I mean, does anybody here think
for a solitary second

926
01:22:21,306 --> 01:22:24,309
that if we stop killing them,
they're gonna stop killing us?

927
01:22:26,561 --> 01:22:29,898
It's a vicious cycle,
it doesn't matter who made it vicious.

928
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:32,942
But they aren't gonna stop,

929
01:22:33,902 --> 01:22:35,236
so we can't.

930
01:22:36,237 --> 01:22:40,492
And that's why I'm gonna sit over
Afghanistan and Pakistan,

931
01:22:40,575 --> 01:22:43,453
Yemen, Somalia,
Sacramento-fucking-California,

932
01:22:44,245 --> 01:22:47,290
every day of what's left
of my sorry career

933
01:22:47,374 --> 01:22:50,085
if it saves one innocent American life.

934
01:22:50,460 --> 01:22:52,962
'Cause I got no idea in hell

935
01:22:54,923 --> 01:22:58,468
how to explain to some grieving parents
their son or daughter is dead

936
01:22:58,551 --> 01:23:01,137
because we thought
enough was enough.

937
01:23:01,596 --> 01:23:03,807
We declared victory and went home.

938
01:23:05,225 --> 01:23:07,227
It never ends,

939
01:23:08,019 --> 01:23:09,229
sir.

940
01:23:31,334 --> 01:23:33,086
<i>Prepare for a follow-up.</i>

941
01:23:54,149 --> 01:23:55,775
What would you like us to hit, sir?

942
01:24:03,658 --> 01:24:05,076
<i>Why aren't they responding?</i>

943
01:24:07,245 --> 01:24:12,375
Could it be perhaps that they think
you're gonna hit them again, Langley?

944
01:24:15,462 --> 01:24:18,214
What is it you'd like us to do, Langley?

945
01:24:18,798 --> 01:24:21,718
<i>If they can wait, so can we.</i>

946
01:24:22,302 --> 01:24:24,095
<i>What's our loiter time?</i>

947
01:24:25,805 --> 01:24:26,931
Eight hours.

948
01:24:27,849 --> 01:24:29,267
<i>Then we wait.</i>

949
01:24:52,165 --> 01:24:54,626
All this circling's
making me dizzy, Major.

950
01:24:56,294 --> 01:24:58,129
Can you at least go the other way?

951
01:25:03,051 --> 01:25:04,886
A vehicle approaching from the west.

952
01:25:05,386 --> 01:25:07,639
<i>We are identifying the target.</i>

953
01:25:11,434 --> 01:25:14,270
<i>Positive ID. Target qualifies.</i>

954
01:25:14,395 --> 01:25:15,897
<i>Permission to prosecute.</i>

955
01:25:20,235 --> 01:25:22,153
Should I bother pointing out
the non-combatants

956
01:25:22,237 --> 01:25:23,363
in the impact zone, sir?

957
01:25:24,656 --> 01:25:28,743
Or should I assume that
all collateral damage is proportionate?

958
01:25:29,369 --> 01:25:30,745
<i>Engage immediately.</i>

959
01:25:34,916 --> 01:25:35,917
<i>Laser.</i>

960
01:25:38,461 --> 01:25:39,671
<i>Laser.</i>

961
01:25:43,967 --> 01:25:45,051
Airman.

962
01:25:47,428 --> 01:25:48,638
Lasing.

963
01:25:49,847 --> 01:25:53,142
Master arm on, weapon's hot.

964
01:25:54,769 --> 01:25:56,771
Three, two...

965
01:26:01,067 --> 01:26:03,069
I've lost the link, sir.

966
01:26:03,152 --> 01:26:04,445
Yeah, I've lost the link.

967
01:26:05,613 --> 01:26:07,657
<i>Get it back. Reacquire.</i>

968
01:26:08,366 --> 01:26:10,118
Reaper in default setting.

969
01:26:10,743 --> 01:26:11,783
Automatic holding pattern.

970
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,663
Attempting to reacquire now.

971
01:26:19,794 --> 01:26:21,588
Link re-established.

972
01:26:24,465 --> 01:26:27,093
- Shit.
- They've gotten away.

973
01:26:27,218 --> 01:26:29,262
<i>Locate the target. Find them.</i>

974
01:26:32,307 --> 01:26:34,058
<i>There. Strike the truck.</i>

975
01:26:34,142 --> 01:26:35,560
Yes, sir. Which one?

976
01:26:35,643 --> 01:26:36,894
<i>Hit the truck!</i>

977
01:26:37,395 --> 01:26:40,315
- Which <i>one, Langley?
- Jesus Christ!</i>

978
01:26:41,983 --> 01:26:43,735
Which truck, sir?

979
01:26:47,614 --> 01:26:48,990
Langley, which one?

980
01:26:49,699 --> 01:26:50,992
<i>Fuck!</i>

981
01:26:53,411 --> 01:26:54,787
Which one, sir?

982
01:26:56,247 --> 01:26:57,498
Which one?

983
01:27:01,961 --> 01:27:03,880
Captain Christie, take the controls.

984
01:27:10,803 --> 01:27:11,888
Major.

985
01:27:14,349 --> 01:27:15,391
Major.

986
01:27:28,363 --> 01:27:30,448
You deliberately dropped the link, Major.

987
01:27:30,698 --> 01:27:33,201
And last time I checked,
that's Article 92.

988
01:27:33,785 --> 01:27:35,578
Failure to comply with a lawful order.

989
01:27:37,246 --> 01:27:39,916
- And orders...
- Are orders.

990
01:27:47,215 --> 01:27:49,050
I gotta do something, Tommy.

991
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:52,845
You tied my hands.

992
01:27:55,640 --> 01:27:58,559
If I don't do something,
the IT spooks will crawl up the ass

993
01:27:58,643 --> 01:28:01,562
of your console to work out
what we both know you did.

994
01:28:02,313 --> 01:28:04,482
And they'll come down on you
a fuck sight harder.

995
01:28:05,191 --> 01:28:06,192
I gotta do something.

996
01:28:09,070 --> 01:28:10,738
They're never gonna let it go.

997
01:28:17,328 --> 01:28:20,748
I guess this is a bad time to bring up
getting me back in a plane.

998
01:28:49,318 --> 01:28:50,737
Hey, Molly.

999
01:28:52,280 --> 01:28:53,364
Hi.

1000
01:28:54,365 --> 01:28:55,783
<i>You know that promotion?</i>

1001
01:28:58,035 --> 01:28:59,620
It got rescinded.

1002
01:29:00,955 --> 01:29:03,249
<i>I've been downgraded to surveillance.</i>

1003
01:29:03,541 --> 01:29:06,210
<i>- What'd you do?
- More like what I didn't do.</i>

1004
01:29:07,962 --> 01:29:09,964
I'm never gonna fly again.

1005
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,800
I'm sorry.

1006
01:29:13,176 --> 01:29:14,635
<i>No, I'm sorry.</i>

1007
01:29:15,303 --> 01:29:18,139
<i>Look, this morning, how I left today...</i>

1008
01:29:18,222 --> 01:29:19,640
<i>- Tom my.
- Please, Molly.</i>

1009
01:29:19,724 --> 01:29:22,435
Tommy, I have something
I have to tell you.

1010
01:29:22,518 --> 01:29:25,396
<i>Please, Molly. Listen to me.</i>

1011
01:29:25,480 --> 01:29:27,231
<i>Give me a chance, all right?
I wanna make this up...</i>

1012
01:29:27,315 --> 01:29:30,151
I'm taking the kids
to my sister's in Reno.

1013
01:29:32,195 --> 01:29:33,863
When will you be back?

1014
01:29:35,907 --> 01:29:37,366
<i>I don't know.</i>

1015
01:29:40,077 --> 01:29:41,412
You're leaving me?

1016
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,210
You left me first.

1017
01:29:48,795 --> 01:29:50,338
Molly, please.

1018
01:29:50,505 --> 01:29:53,007
I'm so sorry, Tommy. I've got to go.

1019
01:30:55,194 --> 01:30:57,405
Now I assume you know
we don't fly them

1020
01:30:57,488 --> 01:30:59,907
all the way there from here in Vegas,

1021
01:31:00,533 --> 01:31:01,617
but I guess I shouldn't assume anything.

1022
01:31:01,701 --> 01:31:03,744
I got food in my fridge
older than most of you.

1023
01:31:05,079 --> 01:31:08,124
Now, all take-offs and landings occur

1024
01:31:08,207 --> 01:31:10,209
in and around
whatever godforsaken place

1025
01:31:10,293 --> 01:31:11,627
we're at war with that day.

1026
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:28,144
- You can't smoke here.
- Yeah, I know.

1027
01:31:36,611 --> 01:31:37,737
Sorry.

1028
01:31:40,281 --> 01:31:41,574
I heard your wife moved out.

1029
01:31:45,411 --> 01:31:47,872
Now they've stuck you
back on Kahili surveillance?

1030
01:31:48,414 --> 01:31:49,790
It's not your week.

1031
01:31:54,462 --> 01:31:55,963
I wanted to tell you

1032
01:31:57,173 --> 01:31:58,633
what happened with you,

1033
01:32:00,635 --> 01:32:02,053
I turned in my wings.

1034
01:32:04,931 --> 01:32:09,644
Yeah, can't make the battlefields
and blackjack thing work after all.

1035
01:32:17,485 --> 01:32:20,905
So I guess the order...

1036
01:32:22,490 --> 01:32:25,660
You know, the one prohibiting officers
and enlisted from fraternizing...

1037
01:32:27,411 --> 01:32:29,705
- Article 15.
- ...no longer applies.

1038
01:32:43,761 --> 01:32:44,762
If you change your mind.

1039
01:32:46,347 --> 01:32:49,433
The airman part's
a little misleading, but...

1040
01:32:52,353 --> 01:32:56,357
Make no mistake, I am first class.

1041
01:33:32,226 --> 01:33:33,519
Widen out.

1042
01:33:39,025 --> 01:33:41,318
Yeah, there's nothing going on here.

1043
01:33:42,236 --> 01:33:43,904
Why don't you two take a break.

1044
01:33:45,489 --> 01:33:48,909
I sure could use a break.
Thank you, Major.

1045
01:33:49,910 --> 01:33:51,203
Go on, Zim.

1046
01:33:51,412 --> 01:33:53,080
You can tell her all about
how close you were

1047
01:33:53,164 --> 01:33:56,083
to making that elite CT unit at Langley.

1048
01:34:33,954 --> 01:34:36,082
We're not gonna record anything today.

1049
01:34:40,628 --> 01:34:42,004
I got you.

1050
01:34:45,716 --> 01:34:47,968
All right, let's get a little closer.

1051
01:34:51,013 --> 01:34:52,723
Okay, there you are.

1052
01:34:53,641 --> 01:34:54,850
Going hot.

1053
01:34:59,605 --> 01:35:03,859
One Minnesota, two Minnesota...

1054
01:35:05,778 --> 01:35:07,613
You stay there. Okay, that's fine.

1055
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,949
That's fine. Just stay put.

1056
01:35:10,741 --> 01:35:14,620
Three, two, one, rifle.

1057
01:35:15,329 --> 01:35:16,956
Time of flight, 10 seconds.

1058
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:21,043
No, what are you doing?

1059
01:35:21,752 --> 01:35:24,588
No, no, no, go back. Stay back.

1060
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,673
Get back...

1061
01:35:41,522 --> 01:35:42,815
Oh, my God.

1062
01:35:43,983 --> 01:35:46,986
Oh, please. Oh, please.

1063
01:35:48,821 --> 01:35:50,948
Oh, please, please,
please, please, please,

1064
01:35:51,031 --> 01:35:52,825
come on, come on, go...

1065
01:36:32,740 --> 01:36:35,117
Master arm off, weapon's safe.

1066
01:36:43,751 --> 01:36:45,044
Major Egan?

1067
01:36:57,514 --> 01:36:58,724
Egan.

1068
01:37:02,561 --> 01:37:03,729
Tommy.
