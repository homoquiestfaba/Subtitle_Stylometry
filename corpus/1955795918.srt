1
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,650
Did you just see yourself right now?

2
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:40,128
You look like you
just had a lobotomy.

3
00:00:40,153 --> 00:00:41,633
What's wrong with you?

4
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:46,485
- This is reality.
- Reality my ass. So I've made up

5
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,355
May I ask you this? Huh.

6
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:53,103
How many times on this show
have you seen the cops arrests

7
00:00:53,128 --> 00:00:57,046
- you know, killers and rapists?
Or something like that

8
00:00:57,071 --> 00:01:00,927
How many times did they slap the cuffs
on some crooked CEO fuck?

9
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:03,286
- What can I get you?
- Beer.

10
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:06,135
- Bottle or draft?
- Uh, Draft.

11
00:01:06,477 --> 00:01:11,411
What you see is I'm always catching drug
users and johns -- You know people...

12
00:01:11,436 --> 00:01:15,779
...just hurtin', just lookin' for a
little pleasure in life. Three dollars.

13
00:01:15,804 --> 00:01:20,380
- What have you got against cops?
- I'm nothin' against cops

14
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,664
Jeez.

15
00:01:23,297 --> 00:01:25,363
I'd tell you what I got some against

16
00:01:26,269 --> 00:01:28,284
I got something against stupidity.
Good ol'

17
00:01:28,309 --> 00:01:30,414
stupidity. That's why I
got somethin against.

18
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:32,326
- There you go.
- Keep it.

19
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:33,269
- Thanks.

20
00:01:34,256 --> 00:01:37,693
- You comin' or goin'?
- Passing through, kind of.

21
00:01:39,696 --> 00:01:43,635
I swear to god, a fly can go in your mouth
and you would've even know it

22
00:01:43,848 --> 00:01:47,540
You just swallow it, cos it's like
the only protein you've ever had.

23
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:49,923
- It's a good beer.
- Huh?

24
00:01:49,948 --> 00:01:51,647
- Good beer.
- Yeah.

25
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:54,396
It's from Pennsylvania.

26
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:57,667
- How long have you had this place?
- Too long.

27
00:02:00,004 --> 00:02:02,474
It's real homey.

28
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,078
You think so?

29
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:10,190
- Where the hell do you live?
- New Hampshire. Portsmouth.

30
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:13,906
- Home of the Navy prison.
- Yeah, I know the place.

31
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:17,089
You don't remember me, do you?

32
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:34,781
Wait a minute.

33
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:37,541
That can't be.

34
00:02:37,852 --> 00:02:40,478
- To be
- No way.

35
00:02:43,149 --> 00:02:46,507
Sweet Jesus, Doc!

36
00:02:46,627 --> 00:02:50,068
Well, Doc,
nobody's calling me that for a long time

37
00:02:50,188 --> 00:02:53,762
Fuck me, Doc.
You made it.

38
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:59,432
Wow. Hey O'Toole. Look in here
He's my old buddy from 'Nam.

39
00:02:59,526 --> 00:03:02,573
- I saved his life once.
- He never saved my life.

40
00:03:02,693 --> 00:03:04,665
Didn't think so.

41
00:03:04,818 --> 00:03:07,298
You gotta excuse me, Doc.
I'm shit for names.

42
00:03:07,323 --> 00:03:08,940
Shepherd. Larry Shepherd.

43
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:12,724
Shep. That's right.
Nineteen year-old kid. Navy corpsman.

44
00:03:12,844 --> 00:03:15,617
- Once.
- Yeah, well, we were all something once.

45
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,798
Now we're something else.

46
00:03:17,918 --> 00:03:20,580
- So you do remember me?
- 'Course I remember you.

47
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,485
- You heard, I got busted down to EOne?
- Yeah.

48
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,777
Most unfair.

49
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:30,004
The green weenie -
they broke it off in you.

50
00:03:32,341 --> 00:03:36,147
How long was it? Was it like...
What? Three years?

51
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,057
Ended up about two,
with good behavior.

52
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,817
Oh. I see, It's not so bad.

53
00:03:42,351 --> 00:03:45,956
It was pretty bad.
It was a long time ago.

54
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:51,008
BCD?

55
00:03:51,128 --> 00:03:54,470
Yeah, but at some point instead
of calling it a Bad Conduct Discharge,

56
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:57,210
I started calling
it a better career decision.

57
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,837
Fuckin-A.

58
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:04,891
How did you find my lonesome ass?
- It was easy.

59
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:08,038
The Internet. You can find anybody
on the internet these days.

60
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:10,983
Well that is really fucked.

61
00:04:12,186 --> 00:04:15,792
So Portsmouth,
what do you do for a living there?

62
00:04:15,982 --> 00:04:19,052
Stocking clerk, at the Navy Exchange.

63
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,380
You're gotta be shitting me.

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,910
That's alright.

65
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,905
Don't you go someplace when you close?

66
00:04:41,416 --> 00:04:43,642
Like where?

67
00:04:43,762 --> 00:04:46,469
I don't know, home?

68
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,963
It'll be there tomorrow.

69
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,248
Hey. It's the last slice of pizza.

70
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:54,162
Do you want it?

71
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:57,300
That's it. Once this is gone,
there's no more pizza.

72
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,586
Sure? Going once. Going twice.
Gone.

73
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,418
I love cold pizza.

74
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,118
Do you want a beer?

75
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:10,283
You sure?

76
00:06:10,403 --> 00:06:12,709
It always works for me.

77
00:06:14,111 --> 00:06:16,199
Fuck

78
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:20,716
I'm feeling a little fucked up from last
night if you want to know the truth

79
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,458
I'm getting too old for this shit, frankly.

80
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:31,448
What's the deal with the grill
part of Sal's Bar & Grill?

81
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:35,031
Well. Gone to rust is the deal.

82
00:06:36,232 --> 00:06:39,860
I guess people just lost their
taste for an honest burger.

83
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,325
- Why? You hungry?
- No. Just curious.

84
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,667
Hey. You know what?

85
00:06:44,692 --> 00:06:48,779
We got Mexicans here now,
so we can get some chorizo con huevos.

86
00:06:49,491 --> 00:06:52,478
Hell, we qualify for menudo.
You got the balls for that?

87
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:53,498
No thanks.

88
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,747
You want a bite?

89
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:59,413
There's something I'd like to show you,
though, if you're up for it.

90
00:06:59,533 --> 00:07:01,616
Sure. I'm always up for it.

91
00:07:01,736 --> 00:07:03,752
You got a car?

92
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:06,957
Of course I got a car.
I'm a fucking businessman.

93
00:07:12,859 --> 00:07:14,998
We'll go now?

94
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:16,550
Yeah, whatever.

95
00:07:38,339 --> 00:07:41,499
I just fuckin' love it, you know?

96
00:07:41,619 --> 00:07:43,724
It's priceless.

97
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:46,417
- What is?
- The Navy.

98
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:51,033
They put the cock to you, then they
let you work at the Navy Exchange.

99
00:07:51,153 --> 00:07:53,815
I got five people under me.

100
00:07:54,149 --> 00:07:56,352
You're a fuckin' inspiration.

101
00:07:56,472 --> 00:07:58,600
You know what amazes me about you?

102
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,183
Could be anything.
I'm a pretty amazing guy.

103
00:08:01,303 --> 00:08:05,990
You turn the keys of your bar over the guy
who's sleeping under pool table

104
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,125
and the you jumped in your car,
and you drive me to hell and gone,

105
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,993
and you don't even
know where we're going.

106
00:08:11,438 --> 00:08:14,539
I didn't think it would
take so fuckin' long.

107
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:18,581
- Take this left up here.
- Right here?

108
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:20,784
That's going in to a church.

109
00:08:20,904 --> 00:08:23,655
Oh no. What are you doing?

110
00:08:23,775 --> 00:08:26,339
No, you gonna love this.
I promise.

111
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,455
I don't know,
Doc, you seen one, you seen them all.

112
00:08:29,575 --> 00:08:31,502
It's going to be good.

113
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:34,729
Jeez. What you get me into here?

114
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:37,838
See, us Christians. Brothers and Sisters.

115
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:40,620
We have choices.

116
00:08:41,666 --> 00:08:45,449
We can choose to lay down our will.

117
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,743
...and follow God's will.

118
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:53,300
The question is, are you
willing to do that?

119
00:08:53,656 --> 00:08:55,424
...Now are you ready?
But are you willing?

120
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:56,517
Oh. My. Fucking. God.

121
00:08:57,418 --> 00:08:59,716
You see cos if you're willing...

122
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,877
...If you are willing, you
can trust and believe...

123
00:09:01,902 --> 00:09:03,742
- Is that's him?
- I told you you'd like this.

124
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:06,033
...that God will take care of the rest...

125
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:10,582
...Yes it will.

126
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:13,205
...It's a powerful thing.
- What's he doing?

127
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:16,820
...when you surrender to
God's will and you take...

128
00:09:16,845 --> 00:09:18,040
- Excuse me.

129
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,504
A Powerful thing!

130
00:09:20,838 --> 00:09:23,102
When you begin to...

131
00:09:23,222 --> 00:09:28,040
...take that moment to look deep
inside yourself and ask to the question.

132
00:09:28,065 --> 00:09:32,338
Am I willing to
surrender to God?

133
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,902
Do you know what is
called when God answers?

134
00:09:37,022 --> 00:09:42,562
When God answers, it is
called that you're having a God moment.

135
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:51,434
You see, when we stop to
ask our, my choices...

136
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,464
Are the Christ-like choices?

137
00:09:54,584 --> 00:09:57,811
The dude was a first-class

138
00:09:57,836 --> 00:10:01,000
drinker, gambler and cocksman.
- Shh.

139
00:10:01,989 --> 00:10:03,502
Shut up.

140
00:10:03,622 --> 00:10:05,728
Most likely a speed freak.

141
00:10:05,848 --> 00:10:08,777
- How the hell did you find this place?
- The Internet.

142
00:10:09,133 --> 00:10:11,504
Son of a bitch.

143
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:17,050
Where people are counting on
your Christ like character.

144
00:10:17,735 --> 00:10:23,541
Are trusting that you will demonstrate
Christ like integrity.

145
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:36,604
I see we have some visitors among us today.

146
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:39,601
Welcome to our Sunday services.

147
00:10:39,721 --> 00:10:43,687
Would you care to stand
and perhaps introduce yourselves?

148
00:10:43,712 --> 00:10:45,207
Alright.

149
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:48,770
My name is Sal. Salvatore Nealon.

150
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:53,517
U.S. M.C. Sergeant. Retired.

151
00:10:55,876 --> 00:10:59,481
Come on.
Guess who this lad is?

152
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,907
It's Doc!

153
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:05,429
Doc. Also known as
Larry Shepherd.

154
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:08,482
We were in service
together with you Pastor.

155
00:11:08,948 --> 00:11:10,439
Bless my soul.

156
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:12,642
Praise God!

157
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:16,103
Thank you for joining us on
our fellowship this Sunday.

158
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:25,363
Man, oh, man, southern ham.

159
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:28,457
Thank you, ma'am.

160
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,676
Listen up, Ruth.

161
00:11:30,796 --> 00:11:33,881
I'm hoping that this
old man appreciates you.

162
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:37,321
- Oh, I think he does.
- 'Cause if ever he don't,

163
00:11:37,474 --> 00:11:40,691
You pack a bag and you come live with Sal.

164
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:44,097
- You don't have a wife?
- No, ma'am.

165
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:47,013
Neither chick nor child.

166
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:50,218
I do have a lady friend,

167
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:52,799
but she don't cook worth a damn.

168
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:56,182
She has other talents,
if you know what I mean.

169
00:11:57,201 --> 00:12:01,229
What about you, Mr. Shepherd?
Are you single or married?

170
00:12:01,349 --> 00:12:04,656
I married a wonderful woman, Mrs. Mueller.

171
00:12:04,776 --> 00:12:07,438
The light of my life, my Mary.

172
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:09,953
A heart as big as... anything.

173
00:12:10,574 --> 00:12:13,757
A real pretty girl, with a great big smile.

174
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,916
Nice.

175
00:12:16,294 --> 00:12:18,097
She...

176
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:22,014
She had a little... slowness...
because of a thing when she was born.

177
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:25,105
What's that mean, she's retarded?

178
00:12:25,595 --> 00:12:30,061
No, she could do anything
anybody else could,

179
00:12:30,248 --> 00:12:33,251
she was just a little delayed.

180
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:38,698
- A great mom, a great wife.
- What does she do?

181
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,369
Oh, no... I'm sorry.

182
00:12:41,725 --> 00:12:46,154
I lost Mary in January from breast cancer.

183
00:12:48,157 --> 00:12:50,180
I'm so sorry.

184
00:12:51,226 --> 00:12:53,452
I'm sorry, Doc.

185
00:12:53,572 --> 00:12:56,211
You know me, I didn't mean nothin'.

186
00:12:56,331 --> 00:12:59,847
We pay for what we say, Salvatore.

187
00:13:00,062 --> 00:13:03,689
- Well, put it in my tab.
- It's ok. You didn't know.

188
00:13:04,313 --> 00:13:08,047
Your tab is long overdue, I suspect.

189
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,612
Do you have any children, Doc?

190
00:13:12,369 --> 00:13:16,261
Just one, a son. Larry Junior.

191
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:21,310
Richard and I, we have a girl and boy,
and we have four grandchildren.

192
00:13:21,532 --> 00:13:25,058
- Praise God.
- Is it Richard?

193
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,507
Honey, do we have some
coffee or pie or something

194
00:13:27,532 --> 00:13:29,860
for our guests before we
send them on their way?

195
00:13:29,956 --> 00:13:31,705
Richard.

196
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:35,519
Yes. I have a peach cobbler for dessert.

197
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:39,628
Oh. Peach cobbler...
Now we're livin'.

198
00:13:44,569 --> 00:13:47,707
You've married up, Richard.

199
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,489
I'm glad to see you prevailing
over your hardships, Doc

200
00:13:50,609 --> 00:13:52,959
I do my best.

201
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,603
You, at least, seem to have
turned out to be a decent man.

202
00:13:56,723 --> 00:13:58,717
I'm tryin' to be.

203
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:01,655
- So do I.
- Me too.

204
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:06,262
I...

205
00:14:06,382 --> 00:14:09,703
I regret any role I played in all that

206
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:13,175
foolishness that happened back in Vietnam.

207
00:14:14,577 --> 00:14:16,758
It's okay.

208
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:21,430
What the hell happened
with Mueller the Mauler, huh?

209
00:14:21,614 --> 00:14:24,129
I mean...
Shit...

210
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:27,579
What... you'd put him in the
witness protection program?

211
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:30,717
You got him hiding under
the couch or somethin'?

212
00:14:30,837 --> 00:14:32,519
Jeez.

213
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,365
I grew up, Sal, and I found my
life's purpose along the way.

214
00:14:37,485 --> 00:14:39,902
Good for you.

215
00:14:40,347 --> 00:14:42,907
What about you?

216
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:47,781
I always figured you for
a lifer in the Marine

217
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:47,822
Corps. Is that the
way things shook up?

218
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,010
Yeah...

219
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,725
I re-upped, sure.

220
00:14:53,845 --> 00:14:57,664
I was expectin' all the dominoes to
fall, like they said they would.

221
00:14:57,784 --> 00:15:01,996
I was ready to kill me some commies in
San Diego, but they never showed up -

222
00:15:02,116 --> 00:15:04,399
Can you believe this?

223
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:08,361
People go to Vietnam on fuckin' vacation?

224
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:11,363
They paid good money
there to pictures taken

225
00:15:11,483 --> 00:15:14,898
fifty-two thousand young
Americans took their last dump.

226
00:15:15,018 --> 00:15:16,723
Fuck me.

227
00:15:16,843 --> 00:15:19,105
So you mustered out on principle.

228
00:15:19,225 --> 00:15:22,346
I mustered out with a plate in my head
and one-hundred percent disability.

229
00:15:22,371 --> 00:15:23,924
And that's the good news.

230
00:15:24,070 --> 00:15:26,763
I wonder how the hell happened.

231
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,194
It's a good story.

232
00:15:30,617 --> 00:15:33,265
If I could remember it.

233
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:36,425
I believe drink was involved.

234
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:39,697
Yes. Yes. I'm sure of it.

235
00:15:41,783 --> 00:15:45,055
Speaking of drink,
this is the best water I ever had.

236
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:52,944
You see, Ruth. I was on the shy side
of insubordination most of the time,

237
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:58,011
but I could get away with it, on account of
my dashing good looks and my boyish charm.

238
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:03,329
I guess we should all be
just grateful that we are still alive.

239
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:04,172
Amen.

240
00:16:04,197 --> 00:16:07,045
Praise God. I told myself that.

241
00:16:08,211 --> 00:16:10,592
Doc, You not gonna eat that?

242
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:13,975
I don't want it to go wasted.

243
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:19,313
Are you okay, Doc?

244
00:16:21,984 --> 00:16:24,388
Whatever it is that's troubling you

245
00:16:24,508 --> 00:16:27,704
then it's probably best to talk about it.

246
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:32,176
My son...

247
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:36,204
because of my son.
I came here

248
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:38,808
Found you guys.

249
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,102
- Maybe I shouldn't have
- Your son?

250
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:44,335
Larry Junior.

251
00:16:46,137 --> 00:16:49,142
A year ago he joined the corps.

252
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:54,527
But two days ago they came
and told me he had been killed.

253
00:16:55,858 --> 00:17:00,971
It was in Baghdad, his
convoy got him ambushed.

254
00:17:01,956 --> 00:17:04,431
They told me that he
unloaded his weapon on

255
00:17:04,456 --> 00:17:07,099
them and he died with his
bayonet in his hand.

256
00:17:07,675 --> 00:17:09,879
Jeez.

257
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,752
He's coming home tonight.

258
00:17:12,872 --> 00:17:15,578
He's gonna be buried in Arlington.

259
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:20,741
Full honors. Hero.

260
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:26,079
And I was wondering if
you guys could come with me?

261
00:17:55,888 --> 00:17:58,775
I can promise you this, Doc.
You will meet your

262
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,445
wife and your son again,
in a better place,

263
00:18:01,816 --> 00:18:04,242
Oh come on.

264
00:18:04,754 --> 00:18:07,758
Like a moment of momentary separation.

265
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:11,139
Oh come on.

266
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:15,445
What better place did they go to?
Las Vegas? Miami Beach?

267
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,755
Doc knows the place on which I speaks out.

268
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:21,693
Well, then show him.
He's got a map.

269
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:24,787
Or maybe he can look it up
on the world wide internet.

270
00:18:25,143 --> 00:18:28,392
One only knows it
when one sees it.

271
00:18:28,512 --> 00:18:33,445
The far as your concerns, Sergeant,
it's odds-on you shall never ever see it.

272
00:18:33,565 --> 00:18:36,850
- Then I guess I won't miss it.
- Oh, you will miss it.

273
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:38,787
You will miss it dearly,

274
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:42,214
each and every sweet moment of eternity.

275
00:18:42,614 --> 00:18:45,184
Do you know even know
how long eternity is?

276
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:46,065
Yeah.

277
00:18:46,976 --> 00:18:50,091
It ain't going to matter.
Let me ask you somethin'

278
00:18:50,425 --> 00:18:55,264
With all the billions of people
floatin' around in your heaven,

279
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:59,499
how come none of them ever got
the word back to the rest of us?

280
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:01,925
One of them did.

281
00:19:02,045 --> 00:19:05,107
Oh right, that guy.

282
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:07,913
It's sketchy on the
details, if you ask me.

283
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,273
I'm not asking you.

284
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,431
Okay, Doc. Listen up.

285
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:18,907
I'm really sorry for your loss,

286
00:19:19,027 --> 00:19:22,595
but I ain't gonna blow a
bunch of smoke up your ass.

287
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:27,046
The worst thing that can happen to anybody

288
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,405
has landed on you,

289
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,120
and now you just got to deal with it.

290
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,991
- Lord have mercy.
- What?

291
00:19:35,111 --> 00:19:39,400
You were a hazard when you were younger,
and now you're just an old fool.

292
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,360
What the hell you talkin' about?
I got your hazard dangling in here.

293
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,868
I'm going to ask you to watch
your language in my house.

294
00:19:46,893 --> 00:19:47,727
What language is that?

295
00:19:47,823 --> 00:19:48,845
Man, listen

296
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:51,933
Guys, guys, I don't want
to cost any trouble.

297
00:19:55,631 --> 00:19:57,411
Okay.

298
00:19:58,124 --> 00:19:59,971
Doc.

299
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,671
I'm gonna help you bury your boy.

300
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:05,585
I may not be able to get
you up into heaven,

301
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,464
but I can sure as hell
get you to Arlington.

302
00:20:11,482 --> 00:20:13,618
Mueller?

303
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:19,427
- I'd certainly would like to help you
Doc, but... But he has to stay here.

304
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:22,032
And pray for you,
which will be very helpful.

305
00:20:22,152 --> 00:20:25,415
Richard, could I see you for a moment?

306
00:20:25,904 --> 00:20:29,265
- Of course, dear.
- Mueller, please.

307
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:32,205
I don't get around so
well, as you can see.

308
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,896
It's just in the car.

309
00:20:34,654 --> 00:20:37,859
I know, but I do not think so.

310
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:40,529
No, no. It is impossible.

311
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:49,873
- He's comin' with. That's affirmative.
- He said he wasn't comin'.

312
00:20:50,046 --> 00:20:54,956
Don't matter what he said.
I guarantee his old lady is shaming him.

313
00:20:55,324 --> 00:20:57,957
She's in there right now saying,

314
00:20:58,021 --> 00:21:02,283
"Richard, you have to go with
that poor man". He needs you.

315
00:21:02,437 --> 00:21:05,003
He'll have qualified people to counsel him.

316
00:21:05,234 --> 00:21:08,385
Yes, but who will protect him
from that Sal person?

317
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:11,167
Oh Lord, that's right.

318
00:21:11,472 --> 00:21:14,290
I should always go to
sideways when Sal is around.

319
00:21:14,384 --> 00:21:17,571
Richard, what in the world has
happened to your vocabulary?

320
00:21:17,596 --> 00:21:19,188
I'm sorry baby. I'm sorry

321
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:22,519
It just kinda slipped out. I'm sorry.

322
00:21:23,385 --> 00:21:26,673
You can't refuse friends
in a time of need.

323
00:21:26,698 --> 00:21:27,793
Friends?

324
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,108
I haven't seen these
men in decades.

325
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,655
You can't refuse anybody.
You're a preacher.

326
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:37,156
They represent a dark period
in my life, Ruth. Very dark.

327
00:21:38,136 --> 00:21:41,007
And you represent God.

328
00:21:42,697 --> 00:21:45,613
The man lost his son, Richard.

329
00:21:46,213 --> 00:21:48,884
That's all I need to say.

330
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:05,395
I turned on the radio,
but it's broken.

331
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:09,872
You got a boombox or something?

332
00:22:12,632 --> 00:22:15,391
Hey Doc, you can move you chair back.

333
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:17,862
Seperate. They individually controlled.

334
00:22:17,982 --> 00:22:22,402
Just underneath. Front there.
That's better. Ain't it?

335
00:22:24,838 --> 00:22:27,397
So, Richard.

336
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:30,202
What is the story with the collar?

337
00:22:30,322 --> 00:22:32,820
You got to wear that, is
that a tracking system,

338
00:22:32,845 --> 00:22:34,935
so God knows where you
are on all times?

339
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:38,950
You always have to wear that thing?
Can you relax?

340
00:22:39,177 --> 00:22:42,742
- I am relaxed.
- Really? No, it don't seem that way.

341
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,997
If you say so.

342
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:48,752
I never knew your name was Richard.
In the years we were together.

343
00:22:49,643 --> 00:22:52,358
I mean, it was always Mueller, Richard.

344
00:22:53,738 --> 00:22:57,565
When you was a kid,
did you go by Richie or Rich?

345
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:00,414
Dick? You like Dick?

346
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:04,534
I just never knew
brothers name is Richard,

347
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,887
you know. I didn't know
they named him that.

348
00:23:07,998 --> 00:23:10,713
- Richard Pryor.
- Oh yeah.

349
00:23:10,833 --> 00:23:13,050
Richard Wright.

350
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:15,919
Richie Havens.

351
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:18,300
- Dick Gregory.
- I stand corrected.

352
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,637
Little Richard...

353
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:23,374
Now he likes dick.

354
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:26,445
A big dick.

355
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:29,149
What the fuck?
Look at this guy he's on my ass.

356
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:33,155
- What is he doing on my ass?
- Change lanes.

357
00:23:33,275 --> 00:23:36,649
I'm not gonna change lane. It's my lane.
This is my lane. Get the fuck off my ass

358
00:23:36,778 --> 00:23:41,278
Get out of the way. Just move over.
Come on. Just get out the way. Let him by.

359
00:23:42,316 --> 00:23:44,101
Ok, fuckhead, you want
to play, Let's play.

360
00:23:44,126 --> 00:23:45,602
What are you doing?
Settle down.

361
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:49,082
- Want to play? Ok, just hold on.
- You tryna have an accident out here?

362
00:23:49,107 --> 00:23:51,239
Hold on. I'm gonna
jackknife this motherfucker!

363
00:23:51,264 --> 00:23:52,506
What is wrong with you?

364
00:23:52,546 --> 00:23:55,637
- Wanna play? Hey.
- Hey move. Move over. Let the goddam by

365
00:23:55,743 --> 00:23:59,983
- Alright. Alright. Shit. Jesus
- You tryna get me killed out here?

366
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,909
Fuck you asshole!

367
00:24:03,029 --> 00:24:06,846
I'm talking to you jack-off.
You fucking asshole.

368
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:11,591
You fucking get me heard out here, I will
bury you fucking ass on a Saturday road.

369
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:13,445
You hear me? You understand?

370
00:24:14,428 --> 00:24:17,744
- Keep your eye on the road, man
- Mueller has arrived.

371
00:24:17,864 --> 00:24:21,958
Fuck around I got a wife and a congregation
to get back to. Fucking drive, man.

372
00:24:21,983 --> 00:24:24,322
I'm driving.
I'm driving.

373
00:24:25,515 --> 00:24:29,499
I thought you were lost forever.
I really did.

374
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:52,407
Where're we supposed to go, Doc?

375
00:24:54,181 --> 00:24:56,851
Dover Air Force Base.

376
00:24:57,393 --> 00:24:59,997
That's in fuckin Delaware.

377
00:25:00,117 --> 00:25:02,623
Right. Dover, Delaware.

378
00:25:05,271 --> 00:25:08,543
So, what are we doing here?

379
00:25:08,899 --> 00:25:11,280
I don't know.

380
00:25:11,814 --> 00:25:13,024
You said Arlington.

381
00:25:13,049 --> 00:25:16,487
That's what they said.
That's what they told me.

382
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,979
But now you're saying Dover.

383
00:25:20,099 --> 00:25:25,447
Yeah, I guess, they have to fly in some
place first, so they fly in to Dover.

384
00:25:25,545 --> 00:25:27,854
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. It's alright.

385
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:31,014
It's ok.
Dover, it is.

386
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,130
Do you want me to drive?

387
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:39,093
- Yeah.
- Ok.

388
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,046
What if something is wrong?

389
00:26:10,781 --> 00:26:14,386
No, he's just a guard of the gate.
He don't know nothing.

390
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:19,471
Wonder if there'll be an
honor guard and all that?

391
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,661
There'll be something

392
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,292
It'll be respectful. You know.

393
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:28,211
It's just not public - there's a blackout
on all that stuff this time around.

394
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:32,283
Yeah, no pictures of coffins,
no reminders to the public.

395
00:26:32,403 --> 00:26:34,734
It's all bullshit.

396
00:26:37,493 --> 00:26:40,779
The body is in transit.
The plane's not due 'til 0800 tomorrow.

397
00:26:40,846 --> 00:26:43,137
Come back then and you'll
can wait in the hangar.

398
00:26:43,162 --> 00:26:44,032
Ok. Thank you.

399
00:26:44,094 --> 00:26:47,402
In transit. Everybody is always in transit.

400
00:26:47,542 --> 00:26:49,603
- Even when you're dead.
- Come on, Sal.

401
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,737
- It is okay.
- Sorry.

402
00:26:58,381 --> 00:27:01,586
- How much is it, ma'am?
- It's $35 even.

403
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:06,883
Whoa... what's with the wad?

404
00:27:07,632 --> 00:27:10,962
They took up a collection at
the Exchange, when they heard.

405
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:14,398
See? You got lots of friends.

406
00:27:14,934 --> 00:27:18,477
They felt bad.
They just wanted to do something.

407
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,129
- Here's your key.
- Thank you.

408
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,213
- You guys aren't watching this?
- Watching what?

409
00:27:24,281 --> 00:27:26,527
- They got him!
- Who?

410
00:27:26,574 --> 00:27:28,960
That sumbitch Saddam!

411
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:31,090
They got him in a spider hole!

412
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,512
The Iraqi's in Baghdad celebrated it.

413
00:27:33,632 --> 00:27:36,806
Some with guns, some with cheers.

414
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:42,513
The capture of Saddam Hussain
begins a new era for Iraq.

415
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:46,617
It is expected that the detention
of Sadam Hussain will be regarded

416
00:27:46,737 --> 00:27:48,570
Fuck.

417
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:51,686
I can't blow smoke rings for shit now.

418
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:54,641
Used to good at it.

419
00:27:54,997 --> 00:27:58,243
Something happened with me.

420
00:28:01,558 --> 00:28:03,484
Doc's out.

421
00:28:04,422 --> 00:28:06,202
Look at this fuckin' guy.

422
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:09,680
Fuck me.
One day he is the head of the country.

423
00:28:10,161 --> 00:28:14,354
Next day, he's just some fuck
hiding on a spider hole.

424
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:18,119
Scared to death.

425
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:44,048
He told me not to worry.

426
00:29:08,081 --> 00:29:10,093
Mr. Shepherd.

427
00:29:12,209 --> 00:29:14,719
Mr. Shepherd, I'm Colonel Willits.

428
00:29:14,839 --> 00:29:18,031
The President of the United States
has asked me to express his deep regret

429
00:29:18,151 --> 00:29:20,861
that your son was killed in action.

430
00:29:20,981 --> 00:29:22,286
Thank you.

431
00:29:22,406 --> 00:29:24,921
He died a hero in the
service of his country.

432
00:29:25,041 --> 00:29:28,215
He was an inspiration
to his fellow Marines.

433
00:29:31,278 --> 00:29:35,244
- Can I see him?
- Sir, that would be ill-advised.

434
00:29:35,564 --> 00:29:38,449
Trust me on this.
You do not want to see him like that.

435
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:41,671
- Is it against the rules?
- No.

436
00:29:41,791 --> 00:29:44,819
But the Lance Corporal was hit
in the back of head.

437
00:29:44,939 --> 00:29:47,241
I assure you he felt no pain...

438
00:29:47,361 --> 00:29:50,819
but the exit wound in such
a case is devastating...

439
00:29:51,738 --> 00:29:53,910
to the face.

440
00:29:58,343 --> 00:30:01,299
They were behind him?
They shot him from behind?

441
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:03,775
Take the Colonel's advice, Doc.

442
00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:07,087
Best to remember him as he was.

443
00:30:12,763 --> 00:30:16,111
I'd have to see him, but that's me.

444
00:30:18,229 --> 00:30:20,134
The thing is,

445
00:30:20,419 --> 00:30:23,036
you don't have to listen to
no colonels no more.

446
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,607
Those days are gone.

447
00:30:31,144 --> 00:30:32,924
I'd like to...

448
00:30:34,181 --> 00:30:36,407
I'd like to see my son.

449
00:30:37,689 --> 00:30:42,959
What you see
you will not be able to un-see.

450
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:45,202
I feel... like I have to.

451
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,469
As you wish, Sir.

452
00:30:47,772 --> 00:30:51,350
Lance Corporal Washington, escort these
two gentlemen to the coffee mess.

453
00:30:51,795 --> 00:30:53,416
Yes, sir.

454
00:30:56,693 --> 00:30:58,830
Mr. Shepherd, come with me.

455
00:31:10,468 --> 00:31:11,892
Hey kid.

456
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:15,043
Stand at ease will you,
you're givin' me a fuckin' stiff neck.

457
00:31:17,613 --> 00:31:20,372
I've never heard anyone talk
to the Colonel like that.

458
00:31:20,492 --> 00:31:23,631
Colonels don't scare me.
Never have, never will.

459
00:31:24,076 --> 00:31:25,999
You a Marine?

460
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:31,027
I thought so.

461
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,944
I got more time in the chow line
than you got in the corps.

462
00:31:35,816 --> 00:31:37,549
You too?

463
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:42,819
Semper Fi, do or die.
How do you think I got this cane?

464
00:31:46,131 --> 00:31:49,058
Hey kid. The fuck's
wrong your ear?

465
00:31:49,646 --> 00:31:52,748
- Baghdad boil.
- Say what?

466
00:31:52,848 --> 00:31:54,720
Baghdad boil.

467
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,839
Everybody's got one.

468
00:31:56,932 --> 00:32:01,039
You get bit by a teeny sand fly.

469
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:03,470
Fuckin' Franken ear.

470
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,959
They say it'll go away.
In a year or two.

471
00:32:07,992 --> 00:32:09,808
You can count on that.

472
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:12,590
That's one fucking ugly ear.

473
00:32:23,345 --> 00:32:25,962
This is a big mistake.

474
00:32:26,082 --> 00:32:28,134
Big mistake. Hold on.

475
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:30,965
It's not like you can
do nothin' about it now.

476
00:32:31,085 --> 00:32:33,547
Unless you're gonna go over there
and just out-tough a colonel.

477
00:32:33,572 --> 00:32:34,480
I don't want nothing.

478
00:32:34,711 --> 00:32:38,022
- I'm just along for the ride.
- Oh yeah.

479
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:44,172
- So you two were in 'Nam with Larry's dad?
- We were.

480
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:46,985
- You know what happened back then?
- Naw...

481
00:32:47,105 --> 00:32:50,475
we were just pullin'
triggers, killin' gooks.

482
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:54,861
His dad wound up doing brig time behind it.

483
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:57,246
That's all in the past.

484
00:32:57,834 --> 00:32:59,490
What do you know about that?

485
00:32:59,917 --> 00:33:04,521
Sounded like he fucked up some dudes...
or some dudes fucked him up.

486
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,320
You them dudes?

487
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,955
What exactly did he tell you?

488
00:33:10,312 --> 00:33:13,089
Only some bad shit went down.

489
00:33:13,544 --> 00:33:18,404
I was Larry's best friend.
No one else knew anything about it.

490
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:22,143
You were with him during the ambush?

491
00:33:22,263 --> 00:33:26,256
- Ambush?
- The ambush and a fire fight, they said.

492
00:33:29,126 --> 00:33:31,156
- Okay.
- Okay?

493
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:33,595
Ok, what the fuck is that?

494
00:33:33,715 --> 00:33:36,271
If that's what they're saying it was,
then that's what it was.

495
00:33:36,391 --> 00:33:39,565
Hey. Come on, you're his friend.
You were there, right?

496
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:41,435
What happened?

497
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:45,415
Come on, kid. Don't stoned wall us.
He ain't lookin' at ya.

498
00:33:46,012 --> 00:33:48,362
Come on.
It's just us, Marine to Marine.

499
00:33:48,482 --> 00:33:50,534
Jarhead to Jarhead.

500
00:33:51,121 --> 00:33:53,347
It was fucked.

501
00:33:53,685 --> 00:33:57,122
Me and Shepherd and three other dudes
were all day humping school supplies.

502
00:33:57,255 --> 00:33:59,937
Tablets, pencils, some new books.

503
00:34:00,072 --> 00:34:02,257
It was our last run.

504
00:34:02,536 --> 00:34:07,005
Anyway, we was always stoppin' at this
little store we called Abdul's Haji Mart

505
00:34:07,337 --> 00:34:09,315
for Haji Cokes.

506
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,117
It was my turn to make the run
but Shep said he'd do it.

507
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:17,058
So he gets out and we're bullshitting.
Then this raghead comes up, shouts out

508
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:22,981
Ala Akbar or whatever the fuck,

509
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:24,899
'God is great'.

510
00:34:25,792 --> 00:34:28,268
Puts a cap in Shep's head.

511
00:34:32,096 --> 00:34:33,805
Jeez.

512
00:34:34,441 --> 00:34:36,458
What happened next?

513
00:34:36,578 --> 00:34:38,768
Shit man, we went off.

514
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:41,563
Lit 'em all up -

515
00:34:42,008 --> 00:34:45,654
that raghead, Abdul, and damn
near the whole fuckin' hood.

516
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:50,757
We carried Larry back to
the Hummer and went home.

517
00:34:52,965 --> 00:34:56,351
The kid's supposed to get
the Bronze Star behind this.

518
00:34:56,618 --> 00:34:59,235
Yeah, he'll get the Star.

519
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:02,653
The more Stars the better, right?
- Yeah.

520
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:25,248
- We can't tell him about this.
- We can't?

521
00:35:25,368 --> 00:35:27,553
No. Let him have his Bronze Star.

522
00:35:27,673 --> 00:35:30,527
Let him have his burial at Arlington
with full honors.

523
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:32,717
Let him have his hero.

524
00:35:32,837 --> 00:35:35,868
Lord knows the man he had
little enough in his life.

525
00:35:35,988 --> 00:35:38,171
You mean, let him have the lie?

526
00:35:38,291 --> 00:35:41,013
Think about it, Sal.
What's more important?

527
00:35:41,198 --> 00:35:45,453
I don't know,
but it's never the lie.

528
00:35:53,529 --> 00:35:54,776
Sal.

529
00:35:55,577 --> 00:35:56,894
Sal.

530
00:35:59,189 --> 00:36:03,302
I'm sorry sir, but there is always
a sound reason for my recommendations.

531
00:36:09,161 --> 00:36:12,045
Sal... he doesn't have a face anymore.

532
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:32,679
Gotta be a man now.

533
00:36:34,708 --> 00:36:37,204
- Hey mister.
- Sal.

534
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:42,951
- How'd this boy wind up dead?
- I beg your pardon?

535
00:36:43,681 --> 00:36:45,817
I mean. It's a pretty simple question.

536
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:47,598
What happened?

537
00:36:47,882 --> 00:36:51,608
The Lance Corporal acquitted himself with
dignity and honor, and he died a hero.

538
00:36:51,728 --> 00:36:55,734
Yeah, well, they're all heroes,
ain't they?

539
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,287
That they are, sir.

540
00:36:57,407 --> 00:37:00,029
All heroes, no question.

541
00:37:00,562 --> 00:37:06,686
How did it happen that this boy was shot in
the back of his head, like a fuckin' dog?

542
00:37:08,075 --> 00:37:11,591
He was a brave Marine,
a credit to the corps,

543
00:37:12,001 --> 00:37:14,191
and he served his country well.

544
00:37:14,311 --> 00:37:17,751
Yes, he did. So did we all -

545
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:20,450
Everyone of us here.

546
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:24,802
- And we do it again if we have the chance.
- What's going on, Sal?

547
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,304
I don't know.
That's why I'm askin'.

548
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:32,304
Shouldn't we be making funeral
arrangements. Isn't that why we're here?

549
00:37:32,377 --> 00:37:33,978
One second.

550
00:37:34,098 --> 00:37:37,498
- Were you there, when this happened?
- No, I wasn't.

551
00:37:39,153 --> 00:37:41,201
Where were you?

552
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:45,527
With all due respect sir,
that's none of your business.

553
00:37:47,658 --> 00:37:51,379
Oh, I see. With all due respect,

554
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,882
Doc here ought to get to talk
to somebody who was there.

555
00:37:57,188 --> 00:37:59,164
You weren't.

556
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,496
Alright.

557
00:38:02,173 --> 00:38:04,238
Were you?

558
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:15,337
Yes sir. I was there.

559
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:17,962
Very well.

560
00:38:18,336 --> 00:38:21,523
Lance Corporal Washington,
tell them what happened.

561
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:53,367
So. Where are we with this?

562
00:38:53,634 --> 00:38:56,643
Pretty much where we were before.

563
00:38:57,373 --> 00:38:59,998
Doc wants his son's face back.

564
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,416
You can't blame him for that.

565
00:39:06,585 --> 00:39:10,989
I called my wife.
I'm going home.

566
00:39:11,702 --> 00:39:14,034
I'll be taking the bus.

567
00:39:14,154 --> 00:39:16,260
So. You quittin'?

568
00:39:16,794 --> 00:39:18,627
Quitting what?

569
00:39:20,546 --> 00:39:23,039
Why don't we find out.

570
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:32,198
So. Doc?

571
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:36,186
What are we gonna do here?

572
00:39:38,002 --> 00:39:40,886
I can't bury him in Arlington. Not now.

573
00:39:41,711 --> 00:39:46,237
- He qualifies and he deserves that honor.
- Here, this is what he looked like.

574
00:39:46,661 --> 00:39:48,388
Can I see?

575
00:39:48,726 --> 00:39:50,560
A handsome boy.

576
00:39:51,236 --> 00:39:53,817
The high school girls
were crazy about him.

577
00:39:55,526 --> 00:39:57,823
My handsome boy.

578
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:02,399
- I'm taking Larry home.
- I can assure you that is a bad decision

579
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:05,329
and you will come to regret it.

580
00:40:05,828 --> 00:40:07,341
Sir?

581
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:09,193
Please stop, sir.

582
00:40:09,513 --> 00:40:14,440
The Marines will transport the body for you
at no cost, anywhere you choose.

583
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:23,490
I cannot release the
Lance Corporal's body

584
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:26,035
to anyone, except to a
licensed mortician...

585
00:40:27,577 --> 00:40:29,429
Or to a clergyman,

586
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,601
Isn't that so, Colonel?

587
00:40:32,758 --> 00:40:34,646
Correct.

588
00:40:37,542 --> 00:40:39,696
It looks like...

589
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,007
...that will be me.

590
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,785
Lance.

591
00:41:15,915 --> 00:41:18,265
It's not gonna fit.

592
00:41:18,781 --> 00:41:20,811
How do you get him home now?

593
00:41:20,931 --> 00:41:23,927
What you gonna do, Sal?
Strap the coffin to the roof of your car.

594
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:30,760
We could do that.
Just need little help liftin' it up.

595
00:41:30,874 --> 00:41:33,043
Maybe we can get that
kid with a fucked up ear.

596
00:41:33,068 --> 00:41:34,197
Don't be ridiculous.

597
00:41:34,293 --> 00:41:36,772
Why not? You know a better way to be.

598
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:40,122
You wish you could be ridiculous,
but it's too late now.

599
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:42,653
Doc, you gotta let the
government transport the

600
00:41:42,678 --> 00:41:44,904
body. I mean. It's kinda
thing they're good at.

601
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,600
I don't like the government right now.

602
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:50,405
- You don't have to.
- I don't trust it any more.

603
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:54,212
- You know what? We can rent a truck.
- You know what? Let's do that.

604
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:57,704
You take the car, we'll stay here.

605
00:41:57,824 --> 00:42:00,669
Go find a truck. Pay for it out of that.

606
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:01,756
One truck, comin' up.

607
00:42:01,781 --> 00:42:04,681
I'm comin' with you, Sal. You
can drop me at the bus station.

608
00:42:05,796 --> 00:42:08,983
I think I'll gotta be
gettin' back home now, Doc.

609
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:13,242
I understand, Mueller. I'm sorry for
dragging you all the way up here.

610
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:16,892
I really thought I could be of some help.
I thought we were going to a funeral.

611
00:42:17,012 --> 00:42:18,950
We are going to a funeral,
it just looks like

612
00:42:18,975 --> 00:42:21,038
it's going to take a little
longer to get there.

613
00:42:21,134 --> 00:42:22,919
It's ok.

614
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:26,480
I'm just glad I got a chance
to see you again.

615
00:42:29,311 --> 00:42:31,751
I'm very happy I got to see you again, Doc.

616
00:42:35,793 --> 00:42:37,805
God bless you, Doc.

617
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:40,920
I'll keep you on my prayers.

618
00:42:41,594 --> 00:42:43,980
And bless you to then.

619
00:42:54,594 --> 00:42:57,478
Let me ask you something,
man to man.

620
00:43:00,808 --> 00:43:02,586
Have you ever wonder -

621
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:06,422
What would have happened,
way back then, if we hadn't... you know?

622
00:43:07,027 --> 00:43:10,641
Doc wouldn't have ended up doing
two years in the brig, that's for sure.

623
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:16,105
And you and me, we wouldn't
have had to see what we did.

624
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,954
What was that?

625
00:43:19,434 --> 00:43:21,696
Are you shittin' me?

626
00:43:22,176 --> 00:43:25,727
- You tell me you don't remember?
- I remember a lot of shit.

627
00:43:27,632 --> 00:43:29,893
What are you talking about?

628
00:43:30,267 --> 00:43:33,205
A certain platoon buddy, shot,

629
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:36,360
writhing around on the ground dying,

630
00:43:36,645 --> 00:43:40,597
With nothin' to give him to ease his pain
cause we'd already taken all the morphine

631
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:43,214
God rest his soul.

632
00:43:43,758 --> 00:43:48,192
- It was nothing we could do at that point.
- And we did nothin'.

633
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:53,284
Sometimes you ought to do a little more.

634
00:44:08,484 --> 00:44:10,887
I have a van that would work for you,

635
00:44:11,007 --> 00:44:15,315
but I think you might be happier with a
truck that's got a hydraulic tail lift.

636
00:44:16,824 --> 00:44:19,245
Hydraulic lift. I like that.

637
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,186
What will you be hauling?

638
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:24,213
Your truck with the lift'll handle it.

639
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:27,700
Will you be dropping it off back here
or at another location?

640
00:44:29,391 --> 00:44:31,243
Don'tcha know?

641
00:44:31,363 --> 00:44:33,520
I guess I'm gonna be
droppin' it off here.

642
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,899
And when will that be?

643
00:44:36,522 --> 00:44:39,923
- What are you looking at me for?
- How many days?

644
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:44,926
- You don't know how long you'll need it?
- No, I don't know how long I'll need it.

645
00:44:45,046 --> 00:44:48,720
- Give me a week.
- Oh yeah, a week.

646
00:44:49,058 --> 00:44:51,667
Mueller, come on, it's
outta your hands alright.

647
00:44:51,692 --> 00:44:54,299
Why don't you just sit
down and take a load off,

648
00:44:54,542 --> 00:44:57,551
Let the mountain come to Muhammad alright.

649
00:44:58,306 --> 00:45:00,069
Chill.

650
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,805
I need to see your driver's license.

651
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:07,938
Yeah, here you go.

652
00:45:11,581 --> 00:45:13,486
These are free, right?

653
00:45:13,606 --> 00:45:17,279
- Norfolk, Virginia?
- Gotta live somewhere.

654
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:22,281
- Will you be the only driver?
- No, I'll have some help.

655
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:25,521
Then I'll need to see the
other driver's license.

656
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,281
Is it this gentleman here?

657
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:31,668
His holiness, no.

658
00:45:32,113 --> 00:45:35,602
His holiness can hardly walk, -

659
00:45:35,722 --> 00:45:38,932
let alone handle a big rig
with a hydraulic lift.

660
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:41,598
Whoever, I'll need their license.

661
00:45:42,115 --> 00:45:44,591
What are you doing with the bouncing?
What is that

662
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:45,877
I'm speaking a psalm.

663
00:45:46,156 --> 00:45:48,239
A psalm?

664
00:45:49,544 --> 00:45:53,301
As in OPsalm Bin Laden?

665
00:45:54,155 --> 00:45:58,517
- Are you the only driver?
- Yes, ma'am.

666
00:45:59,450 --> 00:46:01,568
How will you be paying?

667
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:07,230
Take it out of this.

668
00:46:13,184 --> 00:46:16,464
Sixteen or sixty, put a
dude behind the wheel

669
00:46:16,489 --> 00:46:19,411
of a big rig, got to
feel like hot shit.

670
00:46:19,622 --> 00:46:22,640
It's a rented U-Haul with
an automatic transmission.

671
00:46:22,665 --> 00:46:25,112
Bigger than anything
you ever handled.

672
00:46:25,208 --> 00:46:28,577
Look Sal, Doc's boy is dead.
Try not to forget that.

673
00:46:29,236 --> 00:46:31,673
I haven't forgotten that.

674
00:46:32,017 --> 00:46:33,406
Jeez.

675
00:46:33,526 --> 00:46:36,627
But we're still alive, right?
With time tickin' fast away.

676
00:46:36,652 --> 00:46:37,685
- Praise God.

677
00:46:38,142 --> 00:46:40,391
If there's one minute comes up
that's not too terrible,

678
00:46:40,416 --> 00:46:43,127
I'd like to try to enjoy it.
- Alright.

679
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:46,201
- You used to be up for some fun.
- I still am. Oh yeah.

680
00:46:46,321 --> 00:46:48,729
As long as it is right in God's eyes.

681
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:51,742
'God's eyes?'
God don't have no eyes.

682
00:46:51,862 --> 00:46:55,659
Oh yes, he does.
God has eyes and he has ears.

683
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,650
He hears every insult you send His way.

684
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:02,104
You believe me when I tell you, Sergeant.
There will be a reckoning.

685
00:47:02,224 --> 00:47:03,961
Oh, a reckoning?

686
00:47:04,081 --> 00:47:06,810
God is my witness,
I can assure you that.

687
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:11,955
Great, then - because I reckon that I would
take that opportunity to stand at attention

688
00:47:12,075 --> 00:47:14,874
and say to God, "Hey, where were You

689
00:47:14,994 --> 00:47:19,133
when they were rapin' children
and the genocide and all that?

690
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:22,586
Where were You when they flew
airplanes into buildings,

691
00:47:22,611 --> 00:47:25,410
killin' thousands of
people just goin' to work,

692
00:47:25,493 --> 00:47:28,560
Where were You when Doc's kid was just

693
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:33,334
buyin' Cokes with his buddies and some
raghead come up and shoot his face off?"

694
00:47:33,385 --> 00:47:35,508
Where were You?

695
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,386
You see, I am not gonna stand
there and try to explain

696
00:47:38,411 --> 00:47:41,910
myself to him, I'm gonna make
God explain Himself to me!

697
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,076
And I think, by the end of that hill say

698
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,626
"He-hey, come on. Get in here"

699
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:53,925
"You're my kind of dude!
You get me one of these"

700
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:58,764
Good luck with that.
I'll be prayin' for you.

701
00:47:58,884 --> 00:48:01,861
I'll be open for the same thing.

702
00:48:02,591 --> 00:48:06,651
But boy, if He's a tight-ass God,
then I am fucked.

703
00:48:06,771 --> 00:48:10,152
I think it's time for that lube job
on that plate in your head.

704
00:48:10,272 --> 00:48:13,766
Stay the fuck away with my plate.
I'm pickin' up WOR from New York.

705
00:48:14,799 --> 00:48:16,563
I'm homesick.

706
00:48:16,848 --> 00:48:18,540
Hey, wait a minute, maybe...

707
00:48:19,911 --> 00:48:23,703
Oh no, turn that shit off.

708
00:48:23,823 --> 00:48:26,213
- So you know about this stuff right?
- Man.

709
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:30,064
Now, I've been known
to get in a face or two,

710
00:48:30,563 --> 00:48:34,373
- but even I'm offended by this stuff.
- I mean it's damn hard to dance to...

711
00:48:34,493 --> 00:48:37,367
That is one thing that
we can finally agree on.

712
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:38,333
- There you go.

713
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:42,552
Aren't you a little ashamed
to being an African American?

714
00:48:42,672 --> 00:48:44,813
No, not really. Why should I?

715
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:48,071
Because being a dignified
gentleman such as yourself,

716
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:53,854
you who'd be the first to agree
that this is so far away from white Motown.

717
00:48:54,945 --> 00:48:58,826
I have nothing to be ashamed of
I mean, this dude is white.

718
00:49:03,593 --> 00:49:05,694
- White?
- That's affirmative.

719
00:49:05,814 --> 00:49:07,894
- White is right.
- This guy is white.

720
00:49:07,919 --> 00:49:08,580
Word to God

721
00:49:08,605 --> 00:49:12,063
- This is coming out of a white mouth?
- A white sewer mouth.

722
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,486
- Bullshit.
- Nope. Bullshit you not.

723
00:49:16,398 --> 00:49:18,321
Fuck me.

724
00:49:18,891 --> 00:49:21,579
Well then, I ought to be a little ashamed.

725
00:49:21,699 --> 00:49:25,282
Only I never really identify
with the white race.

726
00:49:25,941 --> 00:49:27,789
- Oh, really?
- No.

727
00:49:28,243 --> 00:49:30,326
Now I'm curious.

728
00:49:30,446 --> 00:49:33,602
What race do you identify with?

729
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:35,507
Green.

730
00:49:35,627 --> 00:49:37,527
- Green?
- Yeah.

731
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:39,703
The Corps.

732
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:41,198
Okay.

733
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:45,151
It's really the only culture ever
really thought made any sense.

734
00:49:47,483 --> 00:49:49,139
Alright.

735
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:52,077
- Let me ask you something.
- Hmm.

736
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:56,795
- You ever miss it?
- Not for one blessed minute.

737
00:49:58,421 --> 00:50:00,827
- I don't believe you.
- It's alright.

738
00:50:00,927 --> 00:50:02,307
You don't believe in God either.

739
00:50:03,104 --> 00:50:05,792
Trust him believe, he believes in you.

740
00:50:14,204 --> 00:50:16,714
- No problems?
- No, no problems.

741
00:50:16,834 --> 00:50:20,127
Not unless being trap on a bus for
the next seven hours is a problem.

742
00:50:21,622 --> 00:50:23,741
Busses are real nice now.

743
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:26,999
Recliners, a shitter in the back.

744
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:31,661
Maybe you'll meet some poor redneck
and save his soul.

745
00:50:33,477 --> 00:50:35,720
You get extra points for that?

746
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,320
Does it work like a point system?

747
00:50:38,658 --> 00:50:40,955
I'll tell you when I get there.

748
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:46,294
I'm just hoping I can sleep.
I didn't sleep so good last night.

749
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:47,429
Not me neither.

750
00:50:49,422 --> 00:50:51,879
These will keep you awake.
You want?

751
00:50:52,502 --> 00:50:55,511
No, I don't want having that on my teeth.

752
00:50:56,579 --> 00:51:00,087
Do you remember when we could
sleep in a hole in the ground,

753
00:51:00,207 --> 00:51:02,956
with bullets zinging just overhead?

754
00:51:03,742 --> 00:51:07,837
- You can't go back, Sal.
- Who'd want to?

755
00:51:08,378 --> 00:51:10,883
We can't redo the choices
we made back then.

756
00:51:11,016 --> 00:51:15,819
The best we can do is learn from them
and try to do better in the future.

757
00:51:16,211 --> 00:51:18,935
But you're still gonna do it anyway, huh.

758
00:51:20,804 --> 00:51:23,526
You're gonna take Doc and his
dead boy back to Portsmouth

759
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:25,787
and try to make it fun.

760
00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:28,119
You ought to come with.

761
00:51:31,217 --> 00:51:33,917
Come on.

762
00:51:39,543 --> 00:51:42,516
Well, I'd better get back.

763
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:46,303
I still can't believe it,

764
00:51:46,423 --> 00:51:49,633
you of all people, a preacher.

765
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:55,516
- That's Goddam right.
- Ohh.

766
00:51:59,166 --> 00:52:04,274
Do you ever think that we might
bump into each other again?

767
00:52:04,787 --> 00:52:06,383
From time to time

768
00:52:06,817 --> 00:52:08,972
I don't know.

769
00:52:09,435 --> 00:52:12,710
He moves in mysterious ways.

770
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:16,071
That He does.

771
00:52:17,531 --> 00:52:21,768
All right, bud. Take care of yourself.
I'll see you on Sunday.

772
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,406
Bless you.

773
00:52:23,526 --> 00:52:25,881
Why did I sneeze?

774
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:32,974
I got you.

775
00:52:40,871 --> 00:52:42,562
Alright.

776
00:52:43,844 --> 00:52:47,497
Ready, Doc?
One two Three.

777
00:52:57,662 --> 00:53:01,044
You know. Keep wondering

778
00:53:01,383 --> 00:53:04,142
What your kid would've wanted?

779
00:53:05,404 --> 00:53:08,075
Drink beer with his friends.

780
00:53:08,858 --> 00:53:11,742
To chase girls.

781
00:53:11,862 --> 00:53:15,054
He was only twenty-one,
he wasn't thinking about dying.

782
00:53:18,385 --> 00:53:21,679
Doc. You can make this
a lot easier on yourself.

783
00:53:21,799 --> 00:53:25,489
I don't want to make it easier on myself.

784
00:53:28,868 --> 00:53:30,755
You're right.

785
00:53:31,414 --> 00:53:35,651
Guys like us, we take all
the shit 'til it's disaster,

786
00:53:36,938 --> 00:53:39,199
and then we're cool,

787
00:53:39,319 --> 00:53:42,475
the worst has happened,
like we knew it would.

788
00:53:44,843 --> 00:53:48,537
They sent him to a God-forsaken desert...
Why?

789
00:53:51,653 --> 00:53:53,985
Who knows?

790
00:53:54,608 --> 00:53:57,474
It wasn't to protect America.

791
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:00,976
It's like that jungle they sent us to.

792
00:54:01,096 --> 00:54:03,593
It wasn't a threat to us.

793
00:54:05,053 --> 00:54:09,188
And then they sent him back to me in this,
with more lies...

794
00:54:10,452 --> 00:54:14,672
a hero, honors, Arlington.

795
00:54:18,197 --> 00:54:22,195
I am not going to bury a Marine.

796
00:54:23,281 --> 00:54:26,183
I just gotta bury a son.

797
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,371
Yeah.

798
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:48,012
- Taking a bus today?
- Yes, to Richmond. And you?

799
00:54:48,165 --> 00:54:50,717
Richmond, huh. That home for you?

800
00:54:51,147 --> 00:54:53,996
No, but close. Why?

801
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,521
You're the one they call the Mullah?

802
00:54:57,641 --> 00:55:00,263
- The what?
- Mullah.

803
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:06,553
I'm waiting for a bus to Richmond,

804
00:55:06,838 --> 00:55:09,441
minding my business,
reading the scriptures.

805
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:12,098
The Bible.

806
00:55:12,218 --> 00:55:14,912
Checking out the competition?

807
00:55:15,374 --> 00:55:18,060
Who are you two? What
do you want from me?

808
00:55:18,085 --> 00:55:19,194
That depends.

809
00:55:19,647 --> 00:55:23,031
- We're from Homeland Security.
- What?!

810
00:55:27,642 --> 00:55:29,779
Some rig, huh?

811
00:55:38,915 --> 00:55:40,891
Hold it right there.

812
00:55:47,298 --> 00:55:51,072
It used to mean something.
Esprit de corps.

813
00:55:53,155 --> 00:55:57,530
A unity, a well-earned pride,
some goddamn common sense.

814
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:02,036
- I don't know what it means anymore.
- Fuck them.

815
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:05,189
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em all.

816
00:56:05,274 --> 00:56:07,899
I spent the best years of my life
defendin' this country.

817
00:56:08,013 --> 00:56:09,969
Think your best years
are still ahead of you.

818
00:56:09,994 --> 00:56:10,621
Fuck off.

819
00:56:10,646 --> 00:56:11,546
No, it's true.

820
00:56:11,641 --> 00:56:15,028
Look at me Doc, my future is behind me.

821
00:56:15,148 --> 00:56:17,989
I got a scrambled brain
held together with a steel plate.

822
00:56:18,109 --> 00:56:20,945
And they look at me and what do they see?
A fuckin' terrorist!

823
00:56:21,065 --> 00:56:23,651
An apology would have been nice.

824
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:28,229
They're sorry, all right.
Sorry they didn't smoke our asses.

825
00:56:30,651 --> 00:56:32,502
Don't get it.

826
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,295
Doc?

827
00:56:44,547 --> 00:56:48,222
Oh shit. Did you forget your toothbrush?

828
00:56:54,649 --> 00:56:57,694
I had to call my wife.

829
00:56:57,991 --> 00:57:00,608
From the police station.

830
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,495
You hear me?

831
00:57:02,615 --> 00:57:05,664
From the police station!

832
00:57:06,893 --> 00:57:08,979
What happened?

833
00:57:09,531 --> 00:57:13,252
After they ID'd me as
Reverend Richard Mueller.

834
00:57:14,677 --> 00:57:18,709
And found that I'm not a
Muslim radical nor a Mullah.

835
00:57:21,665 --> 00:57:23,944
"Mullah the Mauler".

836
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:28,293
Oh fuck. It's all over in it.
Our country is fucked.

837
00:57:28,355 --> 00:57:31,235
- Was Ruth upset?
- Oh, she was very upset.

838
00:57:31,355 --> 00:57:34,672
Wanted me to come home right away.
But I said no, no, no, no honey.

839
00:57:34,792 --> 00:57:39,503
There are times that demand that even
old men should become threats.

840
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,633
Fuckin' A right. It's like
during the pinko scare

841
00:57:42,658 --> 00:57:44,319
I thought I was talking

842
00:57:44,615 --> 00:57:47,820
I told my wife I am not coming home

843
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,223
Not until we were done here.

844
00:57:51,813 --> 00:57:54,768
- Where's your boy?
- They've got him again.

845
00:57:55,124 --> 00:57:57,741
Tomorrow we go and get him back

846
00:57:58,008 --> 00:58:00,483
and then we will take him home.

847
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:07,311
Atten hut.

848
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,978
Gentlemen. Good morning.

849
00:58:13,548 --> 00:58:16,450
Colonel, whatever your name is -

850
00:58:16,753 --> 00:58:20,278
- Where's Larry?
- Willits, it's Colonel Willits.

851
00:58:21,671 --> 00:58:25,784
I've been briefed on yesterday's snafu.

852
00:58:25,904 --> 00:58:28,417
Apparently, the U-Haul
agent went off the deep

853
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:30,953
end, but there it is and
what's done is done.

854
00:58:40,752 --> 00:58:43,395
I hope, given further time for reflection,

855
00:58:43,515 --> 00:58:45,662
you can see that
Arlington is a resting

856
00:58:45,687 --> 00:58:48,048
place that should not
be refused in anger.

857
00:58:48,683 --> 00:58:51,229
There lie heroes.

858
00:58:51,549 --> 00:58:54,046
The details of the Lance
Corporal's death are what

859
00:58:54,071 --> 00:58:56,615
they are, but make no mistake:
his death was heroic.

860
00:58:57,196 --> 00:59:01,345
He was in a foreign and hostile land
doing the decent thing.

861
00:59:01,647 --> 00:59:05,500
He deserves to lie beneath the
sacred soil of Arlington.

862
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:09,471
He would want that.
And I urge you to choose that for him.

863
00:59:10,326 --> 00:59:14,463
Thank you. I'm going to take my son home
and bury him in New Hampshire.

864
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:18,896
Not in his uniform. I'm going to
bury him in his graduation suit.

865
00:59:19,965 --> 00:59:21,941
As you wish.

866
00:59:22,061 --> 00:59:25,901
Your government will fly the coffin,
at no cost to you, to Portsmouth

867
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:28,779
and to a funeral director of your choice.

868
00:59:28,941 --> 00:59:31,420
No, we're taking him with us today.

869
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,551
With all due respect sir, you're cutting
off your nose to spite your face.

870
00:59:35,671 --> 00:59:37,801
Hey. Colonel.

871
00:59:38,905 --> 00:59:41,486
Did you look at these faces?

872
00:59:41,606 --> 00:59:45,759
They've already been spited. So why should
we give a fuck about your opinions.

873
00:59:46,037 --> 00:59:48,227
With all due respect.

874
00:59:48,637 --> 00:59:50,827
We're gonna take the train.

875
00:59:52,055 --> 00:59:55,082
Okay, I'll make the arrangements.

876
00:59:57,070 --> 01:00:00,453
Lance Corporal Washington here
will be going with you.

877
01:00:00,862 --> 01:00:04,209
This is Willits. I need you to
make some things happen asap.

878
01:00:04,329 --> 01:00:06,909
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Willits
- Stand by.

879
01:00:07,874 --> 01:00:10,498
We don't need no babysitter.

880
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:15,287
I wasn't implying that you did.
Washington's on TDY, escort duty.

881
01:00:15,407 --> 01:00:18,611
You don't want him,
he goes right back to Baghdad.

882
01:00:19,306 --> 01:00:21,229
Guys?

883
01:00:21,603 --> 01:00:24,327
We could use the help.

884
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:28,564
- Does he pull per diem?
- Of course.

885
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:32,383
Then fall in, Washington!
But he takes his orders from us.

886
01:00:32,677 --> 01:00:35,561
He takes his orders from me.

887
01:00:36,718 --> 01:00:40,018
But, he will accommodate you
in any reasonable way you ask,

888
01:00:40,088 --> 01:00:43,280
because I just ordered him to.
Is that clear?

889
01:00:43,457 --> 01:00:47,125
Very clear.
Colonel.

890
01:00:47,615 --> 01:00:52,467
Boy, you're a fuckin' force of nature?

891
01:00:55,342 --> 01:01:00,064
I would've love to run into you
in the field in my younger days.

892
01:01:00,184 --> 01:01:03,429
You really think so?

893
01:01:03,981 --> 01:01:09,109
One of us woulda been fragged.

894
01:01:59,227 --> 01:02:02,866
I don't give a fuck what they say.
You understand me?

895
01:02:03,001 --> 01:02:04,012
Yes, sir.

896
01:02:04,037 --> 01:02:07,067
The Lance Corporal is ours. He's a
Marine until he goes into the ground,

897
01:02:07,163 --> 01:02:09,892
and remains a Marine for the period
he is under the ground,

898
01:02:10,012 --> 01:02:12,438
plus one hundred years.
Is that clear?

899
01:02:12,558 --> 01:02:17,744
I will not have three over-the-hill
veterans pissing on my corps.

900
01:02:18,082 --> 01:02:21,378
You're a Marine, and your mission
is to see your brother home.

901
01:02:21,498 --> 01:02:24,784
You're in charge, and when in charge,
you take charge. Understood?

902
01:02:24,809 --> 01:02:25,631
Yes, sir!

903
01:02:25,676 --> 01:02:28,614
There's going to be a mortuary affairs
detail at every step of the way.

904
01:02:28,639 --> 01:02:30,760
You will protect the dignity
of that dead Marine,

905
01:02:30,863 --> 01:02:34,594
and you will see to it that
he is buried with honors in his uniform.

906
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:40,239
Not in some cock sucking motherfucking
pussy civilian graduation suit!

907
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,404
- Clear?
- Yes, sir!

908
01:02:42,606 --> 01:02:45,473
And don't let that Sal
fucktard outflank you.

909
01:02:45,593 --> 01:02:48,266
He's old but he's dangerous.
Do not let that happen -

910
01:02:48,353 --> 01:02:49,942
- Kill him first.
- Sir?

911
01:02:50,832 --> 01:02:52,879
- That is not an order.
- Yes, sir.

912
01:02:52,999 --> 01:02:56,796
And just because that crippled preacher
reminds you of your father,

913
01:02:56,916 --> 01:03:00,161
- Don't trust him.
- I never knew my father, sir.

914
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,421
Lance Corporal, do you have
some kind of personal problem?

915
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:04,202
No, sir!

916
01:03:04,247 --> 01:03:06,265
- Then get on it.
- Yes, sir!

917
01:03:26,423 --> 01:03:29,539
- Washington said you served?
- Yes, the army.

918
01:03:30,482 --> 01:03:34,388
- Did you see some shit?
- Yes, it was my first time.

919
01:03:34,782 --> 01:03:37,476
Right, right.
You came back.

920
01:03:38,305 --> 01:03:39,854
Yes.

921
01:03:39,974 --> 01:03:42,922
I'm not pissin' blood and
my babies are all okay.

922
01:03:42,947 --> 01:03:44,107
- That's good.

923
01:03:47,302 --> 01:03:49,670
- John Redman.
- Larry Shepherd.

924
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:52,768
Don't worry - I'll look after your boy.

925
01:03:52,888 --> 01:03:54,370
Thank you.

926
01:03:54,762 --> 01:03:56,534
Whenever you're ready.

927
01:03:59,988 --> 01:04:01,661
Okay.

928
01:04:02,676 --> 01:04:05,507
Hey, Eddie is watching them.

929
01:04:31,935 --> 01:04:34,214
I have a question for ya.

930
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:39,491
When did you get so old?

931
01:04:39,971 --> 01:04:43,461
I think it was over the last
thirty years. Same as you.

932
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,630
Me? No, I categorically deny it.

933
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:50,026
Deny it all you want.
It will not stop the clock

934
01:04:50,146 --> 01:04:53,071
Nor will it turn back time.

935
01:04:55,303 --> 01:04:58,633
What'd you think of that grunt, Washington?

936
01:04:58,900 --> 01:05:01,196
What about him?

937
01:05:01,316 --> 01:05:03,470
I don't know, he don't
say much, him and his

938
01:05:03,495 --> 01:05:05,629
Baghdad boil... that's
some gnarly shit.

939
01:05:05,895 --> 01:05:09,082
- What do you want to know about him?
- I don't want to know nothin' about him.

940
01:05:09,349 --> 01:05:12,269
Sounds like he is an
individual heavy on your mind.

941
01:05:12,389 --> 01:05:15,926
Ain't nothing to have him on my mind.
Just wonderin'.

942
01:05:16,550 --> 01:05:19,683
Then go back and talk to him,
if he's such a mystery to you.

943
01:05:19,803 --> 01:05:24,410
Everything is a mystery to me...
except you.

944
01:05:25,411 --> 01:05:27,789
Please.

945
01:05:33,379 --> 01:05:38,014
- I think I'll go back and talk to him.
- I'm sure he'll enjoy that.

946
01:05:38,423 --> 01:05:41,040
Tell him he should come up here
and sit with us.

947
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:44,601
I'll extend an invitation.

948
01:05:56,530 --> 01:05:58,410
Here we go.

949
01:06:00,564 --> 01:06:02,754
It's bleak.

950
01:06:04,535 --> 01:06:07,045
- You're welcome.
- What for?

951
01:06:08,115 --> 01:06:11,801
Are you on a train in Baghdad?
No, you're not.

952
01:06:12,281 --> 01:06:14,453
I guess not.

953
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:19,314
TDY. Sometimes it's fun,

954
01:06:19,816 --> 01:06:22,594
- sometimes it's a bitch.
- I don't mind.

955
01:06:22,714 --> 01:06:25,211
He was my best friend.

956
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:28,879
You didn't hang with the brothers?

957
01:06:29,556 --> 01:06:33,010
- What the fuck is that?
- I saw it on MTV.

958
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:36,678
- It's not a rule.
- No, I'm not saying it's a rule.

959
01:06:37,141 --> 01:06:40,940
Liked the dude.
He had my back and I had his.

960
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,447
He was honest, said what he thought.

961
01:06:44,669 --> 01:06:47,518
Simple, in a good way.
He never had an attitude.

962
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:49,241
Sounds a lot like his father.

963
01:06:49,468 --> 01:06:51,466
Are you on the honest part?

964
01:06:51,893 --> 01:06:55,080
Doc?
Doc is not a dishonest man.

965
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,328
What about that brig time?

966
01:06:56,353 --> 01:06:58,522
Fuck that. It could
happen to any one of us.

967
01:06:58,618 --> 01:07:00,831
He got fucked.

968
01:07:00,951 --> 01:07:03,847
Doc was a lot younger than us.
He was a kid.

969
01:07:04,168 --> 01:07:06,928
Technically, he was in the Navy.

970
01:07:08,761 --> 01:07:12,020
He wanted to be our friend and

971
01:07:12,140 --> 01:07:14,944
we took advantage of it.

972
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:18,968
We'd done him a favor and now
he was doing one for us.

973
01:07:19,088 --> 01:07:22,926
All the shit went down and
someone had to take the fall.

974
01:07:23,460 --> 01:07:25,561
It was Doc.

975
01:07:27,573 --> 01:07:30,243
Look. Why don't you come up with us
for a while.

976
01:07:30,363 --> 01:07:33,626
- Redman will look after your buddy.
- No problem.

977
01:07:33,746 --> 01:07:35,544
That's all right.

978
01:07:35,664 --> 01:07:39,479
Come on. You got to get outta here.
It's cold out of here like an eskimo pussy.

979
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:42,078
I don't mind. Really

980
01:07:42,594 --> 01:07:44,329
Look.

981
01:07:44,596 --> 01:07:47,587
I want you to come up and
talk to Larry's father.

982
01:07:47,707 --> 01:07:51,860
- Say something nice.
- I don't know what I would say.

983
01:07:52,465 --> 01:07:55,003
You'll think yourself.

984
01:07:55,123 --> 01:07:56,908
Come on.

985
01:07:59,365 --> 01:08:02,143
Boy oh boy. Look at that.

986
01:08:03,087 --> 01:08:05,223
Jeez.

987
01:08:05,343 --> 01:08:08,516
All the shit they bought.
They don't have a clue.

988
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:12,330
They're just regular people out
doing their Christmas shopping, Sal.

989
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:15,113
Fuckin' sheep is what they are.

990
01:08:15,814 --> 01:08:17,473
I wouldn't mind
being one of them.

991
01:08:17,498 --> 01:08:19,773
Well, yeah, it's better
than being shot at.

992
01:08:19,869 --> 01:08:23,862
Rather be fighting them over there
than in our own backyard.

993
01:08:23,982 --> 01:08:26,665
- Sound familiar?
- Oh yeah.

994
01:08:26,785 --> 01:08:29,273
See, we fought the commies
in 'Nam so we wouldn't

995
01:08:29,298 --> 01:08:31,586
have to fight them on
the beaches of Malibu.

996
01:08:31,892 --> 01:08:34,125
Guess it worked.

997
01:08:37,055 --> 01:08:39,494
I guess it did.

998
01:08:41,119 --> 01:08:44,700
Marine's gotta be
willing to die on order.

999
01:08:44,725 --> 01:08:46,889
Semper Fi, do or die.

1000
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:50,044
Yeah - that's always been the mission.

1001
01:08:50,364 --> 01:08:53,587
- It's a bunch of crap.
- You gotta have a reason.

1002
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:56,246
To warn that you are getting in
the fight in the first place.

1003
01:08:56,366 --> 01:09:00,804
What are they telling us this time?
That we are on imminent danger.

1004
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:04,543
Stockpiling of weapons
for mass destruction...

1005
01:09:04,663 --> 01:09:07,013
a possible mushroom cloud.

1006
01:09:07,133 --> 01:09:08,105
Its' lies.

1007
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:11,043
It's the same old
shit: stay the course,

1008
01:09:11,139 --> 01:09:15,880
if we pull out now,
our heroes will have died in vain...

1009
01:09:17,239 --> 01:09:21,922
You'd like to have a little faith in
your leaders, in your country, I mean.

1010
01:09:22,136 --> 01:09:25,268
I love this country. I think we're
good country. Are we a good country?

1011
01:09:25,381 --> 01:09:29,701
We are a good country, but if you
catch your government lying to you,

1012
01:09:30,111 --> 01:09:32,692
It changes everything.

1013
01:09:34,081 --> 01:09:37,642
- How is it to live over there?
- It's all right.

1014
01:09:39,059 --> 01:09:43,083
- But they sure fucking hate us over there.
- Sound familiar.

1015
01:09:43,973 --> 01:09:46,659
I swear to God, we gotta
be the only occupying

1016
01:09:46,684 --> 01:09:49,368
force in history that
expects them to like us.

1017
01:09:49,896 --> 01:09:52,691
When you go out,
you never know what's to expect.

1018
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:57,004
But being from Oakland,
I'm used to people dying all of a sudden.

1019
01:09:57,523 --> 01:09:59,036
Really?

1020
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:03,256
In high school, one of my best friends
was shot by a stray bullet.

1021
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:08,855
My father was robbed on the street,
and they put one in him.

1022
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:12,437
I didn't even know who he
was 'til he turned up dead.

1023
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:14,956
Jesus, kid. Lord. Have mercy on him.
- I'm only sayin'...

1024
01:10:15,630 --> 01:10:19,262
So you joined the Marines to get
away from all that in Oakland?

1025
01:10:19,382 --> 01:10:22,686
No, I didn't have much else to do.

1026
01:10:24,333 --> 01:10:27,075
I wanted to strengthen my character.

1027
01:10:27,195 --> 01:10:30,529
It was that way with Larry too.
We wanted to test ourselves,

1028
01:10:30,649 --> 01:10:34,056
We felt the same thing.

1029
01:10:34,608 --> 01:10:37,670
Every generation has their war.

1030
01:10:38,293 --> 01:10:42,490
Men make the wars, and wars make the men...

1031
01:10:43,024 --> 01:10:45,089
It never ends.

1032
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:48,971
Maybe one day, we try something different.

1033
01:10:49,558 --> 01:10:53,932
When he was little, Larry used to
like to play with toy soldiers.

1034
01:10:55,143 --> 01:10:59,042
He dug trenches for them.
He put them through basic training.

1035
01:11:02,606 --> 01:11:05,918
Mr. Shepherd, Larry was where
he wanted to be.

1036
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:09,532
He hated it.
We all hate it.

1037
01:11:09,835 --> 01:11:14,388
But he gets sent over there, and stops
being about what you want or the war even.

1038
01:11:15,330 --> 01:11:17,680
Either for your brothers.

1039
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,191
That's all that really matters.

1040
01:11:20,796 --> 01:11:23,347
He must have been embarrassed -

1041
01:11:23,467 --> 01:11:26,235
me sitting out the last part
of our war in the brig...

1042
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,181
No, sir.

1043
01:11:28,118 --> 01:11:31,020
He wasn't embarrassed at all.

1044
01:11:31,430 --> 01:11:34,782
The thing that made Larry different
from rest of us in the unit?

1045
01:11:35,369 --> 01:11:38,592
- He had a happy childhood.
- He said that?

1046
01:11:39,304 --> 01:11:43,203
He had a mother and father
who loved him, loved each other.

1047
01:11:44,989 --> 01:11:48,230
Nice house to live in. Good food to eat.

1048
01:11:48,350 --> 01:11:52,342
School, football, nice friends...

1049
01:11:55,756 --> 01:11:58,320
And he loved you.

1050
01:12:07,545 --> 01:12:10,981
Mr. Shepherd, it was my
turn to get the Cokes.

1051
01:12:11,101 --> 01:12:14,079
That was my bullet, not Larry's.

1052
01:12:15,763 --> 01:12:18,309
No no...

1053
01:12:23,045 --> 01:12:26,286
A gray car pulled up to the house.

1054
01:12:28,644 --> 01:12:31,511
A Marine Lieutenant and a Navy chaplain.

1055
01:12:31,631 --> 01:12:34,716
Shiny brass belt buckles.

1056
01:12:34,998 --> 01:12:38,523
I kept staring at those shiny buckles.

1057
01:12:40,214 --> 01:12:44,039
The President has asked me
to express his deep regret..."

1058
01:12:44,965 --> 01:12:47,048
Killed in action.

1059
01:12:47,168 --> 01:12:49,042
In action -

1060
01:12:49,719 --> 01:12:54,659
nothing about shot in the back of
the head getting Cokes for his buddies.

1061
01:12:56,404 --> 01:13:00,175
Nothing about killed while...

1062
01:13:02,163 --> 01:13:05,777
delivering supplies
to Baghdad school system.

1063
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:34,340
There we go.

1064
01:13:48,770 --> 01:13:50,836
Thirsty?

1065
01:13:52,242 --> 01:13:54,930
That went down awfully fast.

1066
01:13:55,312 --> 01:13:59,532
Well I'm drinking for two, now
that you've got all old and boring.

1067
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:03,128
- Might be you're an alcoholic.
- You think?

1068
01:14:03,248 --> 01:14:06,190
- I am.
- Really?

1069
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,208
I recognized that

1070
01:14:10,956 --> 01:14:15,175
and owned up to it.
That was the first step.

1071
01:14:16,297 --> 01:14:19,834
Why don't you take ownership of this beer

1072
01:14:19,954 --> 01:14:22,220
- Don't...

1073
01:14:23,039 --> 01:14:24,868
I'm very good right now.

1074
01:14:25,385 --> 01:14:27,859
With this coffee, I'm fine.

1075
01:14:29,337 --> 01:14:34,657
- At least we're not drug addicts.
- Thank God. Not anymore.

1076
01:14:35,298 --> 01:14:37,416
Not anymore.

1077
01:14:37,536 --> 01:14:41,235
- We never were.
- We took the shit, Sal.

1078
01:14:41,671 --> 01:14:44,075
We needed the shit.

1079
01:14:44,195 --> 01:14:47,876
If we needed it the corps
would have issued it to us.

1080
01:14:48,662 --> 01:14:51,173
Yeah. In a way they did.

1081
01:14:51,475 --> 01:14:54,596
That shit was meant for pain.
All drugs are.

1082
01:14:54,716 --> 01:14:58,780
- So what's wrong with takin 'em then?
- Morphine? It's addictive.

1083
01:14:58,900 --> 01:15:01,575
So is pain.

1084
01:15:01,985 --> 01:15:04,612
We weren't the ones who
were in pain, though.

1085
01:15:04,637 --> 01:15:06,063
The fuck we weren't.

1086
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,840
That's a different kind of pain.

1087
01:15:12,377 --> 01:15:14,727
Pain is pain.

1088
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:22,300
When we get to the next stop,
I gotta call Ruth.

1089
01:15:24,846 --> 01:15:28,885
You know what you need? You need
one of those mobile telephones.

1090
01:15:29,687 --> 01:15:33,669
You could be talking to Ruth right now.
Even on this train you could be talking.

1091
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:37,531
- Say what?
- Ten year-old kids have 'em.

1092
01:15:38,368 --> 01:15:41,982
They've practically stop making pay phones.

1093
01:16:01,724 --> 01:16:04,697
We ended up in Disneyland -

1094
01:16:04,817 --> 01:16:07,837
to resuscitate Doc, who was
metaphorically drowning.

1095
01:16:07,957 --> 01:16:10,793
Stick to the story.

1096
01:16:10,913 --> 01:16:14,585
Let me follow.
There's a Disneyland in Vietnam?

1097
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:22,391
Yes, young blood.

1098
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:24,846
That's what they called
the whore houses and

1099
01:16:24,871 --> 01:16:27,050
the bars that spring
out around the base.

1100
01:16:27,106 --> 01:16:29,955
And it was the company
fucking commander's doing!

1101
01:16:30,075 --> 01:16:33,426
He's the one who told us
to take a few of days off

1102
01:16:33,546 --> 01:16:36,898
and get Doc's ass to Disneyland
before he had a total meltdown.

1103
01:16:37,018 --> 01:16:40,414
- I was having some problems.
- He sure as shit was.

1104
01:16:40,753 --> 01:16:42,865
And the number one
problem he was having is

1105
01:16:42,890 --> 01:16:45,192
that was time for him to
get his cherry busted.

1106
01:16:45,631 --> 01:16:50,135
So yes.
How old were you, first time?

1107
01:16:50,477 --> 01:16:53,240
- Thirteen.
- Good Lord.

1108
01:16:56,551 --> 01:16:59,008
I rest my case.

1109
01:16:59,128 --> 01:17:03,102
- Doc was eighteen.
- I was nineteen.

1110
01:17:03,939 --> 01:17:06,823
One year worse than eighteen.

1111
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:09,725
- It was time.
- No...

1112
01:17:09,845 --> 01:17:12,948
The right time was when I met Mary,
and we committed to each other.

1113
01:17:13,068 --> 01:17:14,301
Come on.

1114
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:19,085
I just want to say that I think that
thirteen is still way too young.

1115
01:17:19,946 --> 01:17:24,633
Anyway, we were in Disneyland,
we're lookin' at this Tomorrowland.

1116
01:17:24,978 --> 01:17:28,486
And then we found one of the
most beautiful whore houses

1117
01:17:28,618 --> 01:17:31,204
I have ever seen.

1118
01:17:32,901 --> 01:17:34,716
- I don't know.
- What?

1119
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:40,613
Paying for sex. Whores and pimps...
it's kind of disgusting.

1120
01:17:41,035 --> 01:17:43,168
Actually, it wasn't that bad.

1121
01:17:44,027 --> 01:17:45,797
There's my guy.

1122
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:51,087
That was okay. That was nice.

1123
01:17:52,458 --> 01:17:57,113
Truth be told. Our Lord and savior Jesus
Christ did not yet entered my heart.

1124
01:17:57,308 --> 01:18:04,236
- And so, I yielded to bad impulses.
- Yielded. You heard that? He yielded.

1125
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,841
I'll tell you what he did with impulses.

1126
01:18:06,961 --> 01:18:10,527
He drank impulses. He smoked impulses...

1127
01:18:11,864 --> 01:18:15,851
...and he fucked impulses.

1128
01:18:16,059 --> 01:18:18,373
Do you know what his nickname is?

1129
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:22,909
"Mueller the Mauler". He was famous for
the five dollars, five minute special.

1130
01:18:23,621 --> 01:18:26,078
He was like a jackrabbit.

1131
01:18:26,198 --> 01:18:28,446
I don't want to spend any more money.

1132
01:18:31,473 --> 01:18:33,831
It's my bad leg!
Man, It's my bad leg!

1133
01:18:34,686 --> 01:18:36,626
You son of a bitch!

1134
01:18:40,526 --> 01:18:43,644
I was also famous for whipping
this motherfuckers ass

1135
01:18:47,685 --> 01:18:49,448
Listen.

1136
01:18:49,568 --> 01:18:53,044
It all seems very funny right now.

1137
01:18:53,164 --> 01:18:55,112
It was funny.

1138
01:18:55,232 --> 01:19:00,400
Well it was pure, dereliction of duty,
pure and simple. Remember that.

1139
01:19:00,520 --> 01:19:04,389
Actually, It was like going
to a friend's house.

1140
01:19:07,131 --> 01:19:11,511
And then you had sex with your friend.

1141
01:19:14,671 --> 01:19:16,166
- Then what?
- And then...

1142
01:19:16,807 --> 01:19:19,193
You give him money.

1143
01:19:20,421 --> 01:19:22,629
And you pay a friend.

1144
01:19:25,074 --> 01:19:27,984
I gotta tell you. We did
get tired of listening to

1145
01:19:28,009 --> 01:19:31,089
him talking about that
beautiful Asian whore of his.

1146
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:33,340
He was so proud.

1147
01:19:33,490 --> 01:19:38,540
He said he had a hard-on so big,
felt like he was in a full body cast.

1148
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:43,204
Nothing can move, he couldn't blink.
He couldn't even move his fingers.

1149
01:19:44,023 --> 01:19:46,597
It's not true.

1150
01:19:46,717 --> 01:19:49,730
I miss those days.

1151
01:19:50,104 --> 01:19:54,555
When you had a boner, you
could hang a towel on.

1152
01:19:57,409 --> 01:20:01,174
I used to have a Johnson that
will stand up and watch me shave.

1153
01:20:01,646 --> 01:20:03,658
Like this.

1154
01:20:05,545 --> 01:20:08,098
How was your day so far?

1155
01:20:08,675 --> 01:20:12,556
Now it watches me pull up my socks.

1156
01:20:18,993 --> 01:20:21,931
When it' goes, it goes.

1157
01:20:22,251 --> 01:20:25,429
Don't encourage him.

1158
01:20:26,204 --> 01:20:28,910
However, it can be used.

1159
01:20:29,030 --> 01:20:31,812
His penis...

1160
01:20:32,417 --> 01:20:34,803
...helps him pick up with socks.

1161
01:20:39,529 --> 01:20:42,213
I just want to see what it looked like.

1162
01:20:52,991 --> 01:20:55,894
At home! New York.

1163
01:20:58,987 --> 01:21:00,557
Let's not wander too far.

1164
01:21:00,582 --> 01:21:04,223
No, just far enough to find
the first Blarney Stone.

1165
01:21:05,007 --> 01:21:07,836
I believe, it's this way.

1166
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:16,319
Take that in. Take a deep breath.

1167
01:21:16,711 --> 01:21:18,207
What? You'd do it?

1168
01:21:18,327 --> 01:21:20,904
- What do you smell?
- This thing smell. What is it?

1169
01:21:21,670 --> 01:21:23,201
Urine.

1170
01:21:23,321 --> 01:21:26,032
I love it.
Its' like the official scent of the city.

1171
01:21:36,169 --> 01:21:39,356
Barkeep, I will have one more drink.

1172
01:21:39,782 --> 01:21:43,076
And then, one more after that.

1173
01:21:43,468 --> 01:21:46,459
See, this is what we call a
man with a drinking problem.

1174
01:21:46,579 --> 01:21:49,966
No, no... I got no problem.
I got this mess.

1175
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:53,845
Born in pain, live
in fear, die lonely.

1176
01:21:54,255 --> 01:21:56,498
Could you be any more Irish right now?

1177
01:21:56,618 --> 01:21:59,293
Could you possibly be any
more Irish right now?

1178
01:21:59,413 --> 01:22:01,741
- No, I do not think I can be.

1179
01:22:01,861 --> 01:22:07,239
Although, I will confess to you
that my mother is actually half-Italian.

1180
01:22:07,794 --> 01:22:10,485
I lost one, he lost two.

1181
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,518
Yeah, guess he thought he was worth it.

1182
01:22:20,921 --> 01:22:23,129
It's not worth it to me.

1183
01:22:25,515 --> 01:22:29,485
Would it be worth his daughters?
He's got twins, right?

1184
01:22:31,290 --> 01:22:33,801
Who? The cheerleader?

1185
01:22:35,492 --> 01:22:40,059
He was a cheerleader in college
before he was a President.

1186
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:43,251
Would it be worth their lives?
Even one of 'em?

1187
01:22:44,087 --> 01:22:45,939
Doc.

1188
01:22:46,348 --> 01:22:47,880
Look here, Doc.

1189
01:22:48,788 --> 01:22:52,064
There's no answers in that.

1190
01:22:52,563 --> 01:22:57,067
The answers you looking for, can be
found in petition and prayer.

1191
01:22:58,545 --> 01:23:01,579
You guys ready for an adventure?

1192
01:23:01,699 --> 01:23:02,950
Let's go. Let's hit it

1193
01:23:03,070 --> 01:23:05,247
- Where are we going?
- It is a secret.

1194
01:23:05,367 --> 01:23:09,360
You'll find out when we get there,
just like heaven.

1195
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:19,412
- How many minutes do I get again?
- On this plan, five hundred.

1196
01:23:21,113 --> 01:23:23,511
- Every month?
- Yes.

1197
01:23:23,795 --> 01:23:26,502
- Is it enough?
- Enough?

1198
01:23:27,178 --> 01:23:29,654
How can anybody talk for
more than five hundred

1199
01:23:29,679 --> 01:23:31,742
minutes a month on a
fuckin' telephone?

1200
01:23:31,838 --> 01:23:34,200
Good point.

1201
01:23:34,539 --> 01:23:37,742
We're going to miss our train, sure as
God made little green apples.

1202
01:23:37,889 --> 01:23:39,257
Calm down.

1203
01:23:39,383 --> 01:23:43,785
And if you call people with the same plan,
It doesn't count of your minutes.

1204
01:23:44,473 --> 01:23:47,053
That's, that's one hell of a plan.

1205
01:23:47,173 --> 01:23:49,723
What do you care who's on the plan?
You don't know anybody on the plan.

1206
01:23:49,843 --> 01:23:52,536
I know you two fuckers.
Come on. Let's get some phones.

1207
01:23:52,656 --> 01:23:55,314
I don't want one. I don't need one.
Thanks.

1208
01:23:55,434 --> 01:23:57,424
I wouldn't mind having one,
to tell you the truth.

1209
01:23:57,816 --> 01:23:59,917
I've often thought about it.

1210
01:24:00,037 --> 01:24:03,157
Barkeep, a round of phones
for my partners here.

1211
01:24:03,277 --> 01:24:06,077
So he and I can talk to each other anytime,

1212
01:24:06,102 --> 01:24:07,870
even though he's in
Norfolk and I'm in New

1213
01:24:07,895 --> 01:24:09,528
Hampshire and it don't
cost us anything?

1214
01:24:09,843 --> 01:24:11,676
That's the deal.

1215
01:24:11,961 --> 01:24:15,484
- I don't believe it.
- Oh my god, Mueller.

1216
01:24:15,824 --> 01:24:18,905
With three-way calling and all
we can talk to each other at the same time.

1217
01:24:19,025 --> 01:24:22,360
Yeah, but are we talking to each
other at the same time right now?

1218
01:24:22,385 --> 01:24:23,629
It will be on phone.

1219
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:27,771
What if I don't like it?

1220
01:24:27,891 --> 01:24:30,473
We got stuck with a contract
for what a year, two years?

1221
01:24:30,498 --> 01:24:31,403
- Just two years.
- Two years.

1222
01:24:32,038 --> 01:24:34,284
What if you fall down?
Have you thought of that?

1223
01:24:34,309 --> 01:24:36,509
With your gimpy legs there's
a real possibility.

1224
01:24:36,605 --> 01:24:38,619
What if you fell
into a ditch and you

1225
01:24:38,644 --> 01:24:40,791
can't get up and
nobody can see you.

1226
01:24:41,161 --> 01:24:43,197
I mean, it is. "Adios Padre."

1227
01:24:43,317 --> 01:24:46,251
But with your mobile phone.

1228
01:24:46,371 --> 01:24:50,364
You get it out and if you can
see the numbers with your glasses.

1229
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:53,386
"Oh I can't see, help me"

1230
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:56,056
"I fall in and I can't get up"

1231
01:24:56,176 --> 01:24:59,225
9-1-1 calls don't count
against your minutes either.

1232
01:24:59,345 --> 01:25:02,397
- That's. Come on.
- All right. All right.

1233
01:25:02,517 --> 01:25:05,258
If I say yes, will you shut the
hell up so we can get our train.

1234
01:25:05,283 --> 01:25:06,196
- I shut up.
- Okay.

1235
01:25:28,634 --> 01:25:30,539
- Hello?
- This is God.

1236
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,715
- Who's this?
- God.

1237
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:35,347
You're not gonna get into heaven after all.

1238
01:25:35,467 --> 01:25:37,680
I'm very displeased with
the way you're talking...

1239
01:25:37,705 --> 01:25:38,441
- Who's this?

1240
01:25:38,537 --> 01:25:40,732
- Who is it?
- This is God.

1241
01:25:41,444 --> 01:25:44,471
- Hey! Sal!
- This is not Sal. This is God.

1242
01:25:45,485 --> 01:25:48,067
You spare enough of my minutes
with your foolishness.

1243
01:25:48,187 --> 01:25:50,743
You should call John Redman on the train.

1244
01:25:52,114 --> 01:25:55,782
This will be my second official call.

1245
01:26:00,116 --> 01:26:03,766
By the way, when you call God,
it doesn't cost you any minutes.

1246
01:26:03,886 --> 01:26:06,116
He told me.

1247
01:26:07,416 --> 01:26:10,381
Hey, John Redman?
Guess who this is?

1248
01:26:10,915 --> 01:26:13,726
Yes, how'd you know?

1249
01:26:14,316 --> 01:26:19,130
I'm calling you from my brand
new mobile cellular cordless telephone

1250
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:21,533
As you didn't know how to use.

1251
01:26:21,653 --> 01:26:24,542
I will gonna give you my number.

1252
01:26:24,662 --> 01:26:27,444
- How do you already have it?
- It comes up on his.

1253
01:26:27,564 --> 01:26:30,186
That's what he said.

1254
01:26:30,306 --> 01:26:32,156
Can you believe this?

1255
01:26:32,276 --> 01:26:35,450
Ok. Listen up. We are on...
Huh?

1256
01:26:38,370 --> 01:26:40,720
Okay.

1257
01:26:41,792 --> 01:26:43,733
Yeah okay.

1258
01:26:45,139 --> 01:26:47,329
What's going on?

1259
01:26:47,449 --> 01:26:50,381
They are on their way to Boston.

1260
01:26:50,501 --> 01:26:53,586
- The train's left without us?
- Yeah. Outstanding.

1261
01:26:53,706 --> 01:26:55,705
Outstanding.

1262
01:26:55,825 --> 01:26:58,553
- I warned you, didn't I?
- Why does it matter?

1263
01:26:58,673 --> 01:27:02,017
We miss the train, will take the next one,
ok? There's a million train to Boston.

1264
01:27:02,137 --> 01:27:05,738
You know what, you worry too much.
That's why your hair went so gray.

1265
01:27:05,858 --> 01:27:07,910
You worry too much.

1266
01:27:20,004 --> 01:27:22,927
We are all set.
We are on the express train to Boston.

1267
01:27:23,047 --> 01:27:25,420
- When?
- 7 a.m.

1268
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:29,390
We are in the city that never sleeps.
Why should we?

1269
01:27:29,843 --> 01:27:32,336
Come on. Let's have some fun.

1270
01:27:32,905 --> 01:27:37,356
Now, you take the fade-away jump shot

1271
01:27:37,476 --> 01:27:39,496
It's a beautiful thing of beauty.

1272
01:27:39,616 --> 01:27:43,431
- Free throws are what win or lose the game.
- Oh fuck. That is so boring.

1273
01:27:43,551 --> 01:27:45,905
- It is true.
- But boring.

1274
01:27:46,333 --> 01:27:49,117
They stopped all the action all the time.

1275
01:27:49,526 --> 01:27:51,983
And there's way too many
of those fuckin' things..

1276
01:27:52,103 --> 01:27:57,063
You're not supposed to go in then bangin'
around with those guys bangin' all the time.

1277
01:27:58,022 --> 01:28:01,067
Fouls, serious fouls

1278
01:28:02,455 --> 01:28:04,716
should be...

1279
01:28:06,141 --> 01:28:08,491
...shameful.

1280
01:28:09,512 --> 01:28:12,236
But there is no fuckin' shame anywhere.

1281
01:28:12,356 --> 01:28:14,978
Look who's talking.

1282
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,643
Have you ever been ashamed about
anything you ever done in your life? Ever?

1283
01:28:22,225 --> 01:28:24,290
- Once.

1284
01:28:25,519 --> 01:28:29,258
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- You know what.

1285
01:28:32,294 --> 01:28:36,443
Because you remember that
Boston was where he was from.

1286
01:28:36,563 --> 01:28:39,451
I remember he was from Boston.

1287
01:28:40,211 --> 01:28:46,270
I've been lookin' into, seeing if I could
find, maybe he still has some family there.

1288
01:28:46,833 --> 01:28:48,423
Why?

1289
01:28:48,543 --> 01:28:52,838
- Because he's drunk.
- What does that have to do with it?

1290
01:28:53,818 --> 01:28:58,144
- You get like this every time you drink?
- Pretty much.

1291
01:28:58,264 --> 01:29:02,381
- Then you shouldn't drink.
- It's what I got instead of God.

1292
01:29:02,501 --> 01:29:04,563
I see.

1293
01:29:04,683 --> 01:29:08,249
I got God, Doc did his time.

1294
01:29:09,353 --> 01:29:11,507
You got drunk.

1295
01:29:14,451 --> 01:29:18,546
- And maybe he got the better of the deal.
- He was gonna die anyway, Sal.

1296
01:29:19,721 --> 01:29:23,514
He didn't have to suffer. Not like that.

1297
01:29:23,879 --> 01:29:27,227
- But he did.
- Jimmy Hightower.

1298
01:29:28,598 --> 01:29:31,304
We can't even say his name.

1299
01:29:33,672 --> 01:29:37,579
We all feel guilty about how
he suffered as he was dying,

1300
01:29:38,433 --> 01:29:42,849
but did it ever occur to you that
maybe nobody would have been shot,

1301
01:29:42,969 --> 01:29:48,604
and everybody would still be alive if we'd all
been doing our jobs instead of fuckin' around?

1302
01:30:00,191 --> 01:30:02,037
Boarding call for
Amtrak Express in

1303
01:30:02,062 --> 01:30:05,544
2150 to Boston with
no intermediate...

1304
01:30:06,264 --> 01:30:07,670
Sal?

1305
01:30:08,222 --> 01:30:09,593
Sal?

1306
01:30:09,931 --> 01:30:11,979
Sal, we're gonna go.

1307
01:30:12,388 --> 01:30:14,703
We gotta go. We got to get at our train.

1308
01:30:16,486 --> 01:30:18,551
Time to go.

1309
01:30:47,662 --> 01:30:50,421
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- No.

1310
01:30:50,688 --> 01:30:52,024
Thank you.

1311
01:30:52,144 --> 01:30:55,513
Why is it that you marry a black woman?

1312
01:30:55,633 --> 01:30:57,383
What?

1313
01:30:58,538 --> 01:31:01,849
It's like you never had
a white woman before.

1314
01:31:01,969 --> 01:31:04,609
I know better. It was in the 70's.

1315
01:31:05,018 --> 01:31:07,457
Which If I remember rightly,

1316
01:31:07,577 --> 01:31:12,934
was when you white dudes admitted
to having a thing for black women.

1317
01:31:13,054 --> 01:31:16,460
I'm gaga for the sisters. They dig me too.

1318
01:31:17,813 --> 01:31:21,243
Couple of them... for a time.

1319
01:31:21,848 --> 01:31:24,074
First of all, Sal.

1320
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:26,826
Who I'm married is
none of your business.

1321
01:31:26,851 --> 01:31:29,154
- That is why I've been
so polite about it.

1322
01:31:29,682 --> 01:31:32,064
Ok, I'll tell you.

1323
01:31:32,184 --> 01:31:35,055
God told me to.

1324
01:31:35,928 --> 01:31:38,563
Did God told you to
marry a black woman?

1325
01:31:38,683 --> 01:31:42,165
No. God told me to marry Ruth.

1326
01:31:44,586 --> 01:31:47,471
How come God don't talk to me?

1327
01:31:47,591 --> 01:31:50,110
- Cause you don't listen.
- My hearing is just fine.

1328
01:31:50,229 --> 01:31:52,847
They're just fine but you don't listen.

1329
01:31:53,737 --> 01:31:57,743
You listen, and that's why he talks to you.

1330
01:31:58,081 --> 01:32:03,138
That's not what I said. I said
that "God told me to marry Ruth".

1331
01:32:03,802 --> 01:32:07,630
"To be a good man and
to preach the words."

1332
01:32:09,090 --> 01:32:11,761
So he does talk to you?

1333
01:32:12,348 --> 01:32:14,621
He touched my heart.

1334
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:18,716
Maybe it was Ruth who touched your heart.
- Yes.

1335
01:32:19,108 --> 01:32:21,369
It was God through her.

1336
01:32:21,489 --> 01:32:25,736
I was down and out, recovering
alcoholic with shot up legs.

1337
01:32:25,871 --> 01:32:29,011
Then one day I found Jesus...

1338
01:32:29,812 --> 01:32:33,266
Where? Where did you find him?
On the street corner?

1339
01:32:33,386 --> 01:32:37,037
No, in my heart, Sal.
the only place you can truly find Him.

1340
01:32:37,464 --> 01:32:42,520
I went deep inside my own heart like it was
some scary cave, some unexplored place.

1341
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,917
Which it was.

1342
01:32:45,037 --> 01:32:48,513
Went down alone and afraid,
came back up fearless and

1343
01:32:48,633 --> 01:32:51,878
with Jesus by my side.

1344
01:32:52,305 --> 01:32:56,422
The very next Sunday I
took myself to church...

1345
01:32:56,885 --> 01:33:00,197
There was Ruth.
- There was Ruth.

1346
01:33:01,585 --> 01:33:04,220
Everything fell into place.

1347
01:33:05,235 --> 01:33:07,907
That's a beautiful story.

1348
01:33:08,227 --> 01:33:11,272
Sorry the fuck I asked.

1349
01:33:12,144 --> 01:33:15,865
If God exists...

1350
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:21,948
...would it kill Him to just tap me on the
shoulder or shake my hand like a man?

1351
01:33:22,927 --> 01:33:25,224
And while he's at it...

1352
01:33:25,344 --> 01:33:29,448
...if he can deliver a nice black girl
with a great ass, so much the better.

1353
01:33:30,572 --> 01:33:33,261
Hey, hey, hey. Me askin' another question.

1354
01:33:33,528 --> 01:33:38,174
When Ruth was a child,
was she a baby Ruth?

1355
01:33:38,294 --> 01:33:40,744
Did you get it?

1356
01:33:41,545 --> 01:33:45,355
No Christmas is for me.
A Doc call it a day.

1357
01:33:50,209 --> 01:33:51,936
That is good Doc.

1358
01:33:54,873 --> 01:33:58,352
Yeah, that's the one we want.

1359
01:33:59,435 --> 01:34:02,017
- What do you think he's up to?
- Wheeling and dealing

1360
01:34:02,302 --> 01:34:04,278
Mr. Cellular Phone.

1361
01:34:04,398 --> 01:34:07,216
- We've got an errand to run.
- We got enough time?

1362
01:34:07,336 --> 01:34:11,664
We got plenty of time. I'm on with Redman. He
and Washington are already in New Hampshire.

1363
01:34:11,784 --> 01:34:14,245
We'll see 'em there.

1364
01:34:14,365 --> 01:34:17,219
I don't know. How do
live without this thing?

1365
01:35:04,705 --> 01:35:07,821
She's been living with it all these years.
What good's it gonna do her?

1366
01:35:07,941 --> 01:35:10,527
We're long overdue, the way I figure.

1367
01:35:10,647 --> 01:35:14,148
She ought to know the truth and we
ought to be men enough to say it.

1368
01:35:15,234 --> 01:35:18,991
- How'd you even find her?
- I got O'Toole to call his granddaughter

1369
01:35:19,111 --> 01:35:22,846
- and have her look it up for us on the world wide web.
- What can we possibly say to her?

1370
01:35:22,966 --> 01:35:25,642
We say the truth.

1371
01:35:26,176 --> 01:35:29,381
Couple more on the left there.

1372
01:35:29,701 --> 01:35:31,517
There it is.

1373
01:35:32,105 --> 01:35:34,564
- This red...
- Yeah, that's it.

1374
01:35:43,520 --> 01:35:45,777
Maybe she's not here.

1375
01:35:46,044 --> 01:35:48,430
We didn't come all this way...

1376
01:35:53,219 --> 01:35:55,907
- Ms. Hightower?
- Yeah.

1377
01:35:56,455 --> 01:36:00,052
I'm Reverend Richard Mueller, I served
with your son in Vietnam.

1378
01:36:00,172 --> 01:36:02,526
One moment please.

1379
01:36:05,517 --> 01:36:07,747
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

1380
01:36:08,459 --> 01:36:11,575
- Come on in.
- Hi, my name is Sal.

1381
01:36:11,842 --> 01:36:15,865
- Hi, Larry Shepherd.
- Glad that you could come.

1382
01:36:20,980 --> 01:36:24,113
I'm gonna show you some pictures.

1383
01:36:26,001 --> 01:36:27,959
This one...

1384
01:36:28,079 --> 01:36:31,688
- That's the last one we ever got from Jimmy.
- Look at him.

1385
01:36:32,631 --> 01:36:36,513
- Do you remember the smile?
- Oh, a handsome man.

1386
01:36:36,943 --> 01:36:39,115
Lord, have mercy.

1387
01:36:39,235 --> 01:36:43,506
And this is his little
girl all grown up now.

1388
01:36:47,743 --> 01:36:49,719
My Lord.

1389
01:36:50,520 --> 01:36:52,924
How old was she when he died?

1390
01:36:53,044 --> 01:36:54,959
Four months.

1391
01:36:55,476 --> 01:37:00,016
Her mom eventually remarried
and they moved to San Diego.

1392
01:37:03,179 --> 01:37:05,049
And this...

1393
01:37:05,583 --> 01:37:08,254
Here's my great-grandkids.

1394
01:37:12,565 --> 01:37:14,363
Look at that.

1395
01:37:15,432 --> 01:37:17,764
He'd be grandfather.

1396
01:37:19,046 --> 01:37:25,368
I have saw them in person, but they called.

1397
01:37:26,407 --> 01:37:31,239
So you three were with my Jimmy?

1398
01:37:31,506 --> 01:37:34,284
Yes ma'am. Third Marine Division.

1399
01:37:34,404 --> 01:37:36,403
We're very tight unit.

1400
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:39,340
Ma'am.

1401
01:37:43,948 --> 01:37:47,830
We'd already fought us a good long year,

1402
01:37:49,272 --> 01:37:53,229
and most of us were still breathing.

1403
01:37:56,452 --> 01:37:59,550
But the extension...

1404
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:03,958
that four more months they added on...

1405
01:38:06,112 --> 01:38:08,213
...that was bad.

1406
01:38:09,815 --> 01:38:14,022
Some of us couldn't handle it,

1407
01:38:14,324 --> 01:38:17,636
and I think that...

1408
01:38:18,010 --> 01:38:20,289
What was it for?

1409
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:27,917
What was it all for?

1410
01:38:28,201 --> 01:38:32,546
Right well. They said they knew,
and we just believed them.

1411
01:38:33,946 --> 01:38:36,332
But now...

1412
01:38:42,350 --> 01:38:44,490
Ms. Hightower.

1413
01:38:44,610 --> 01:38:48,158
We came here to tell you what happened.

1414
01:38:48,959 --> 01:38:50,810
Were you...?

1415
01:38:54,140 --> 01:38:56,928
Were you some of the men he saved?

1416
01:38:57,498 --> 01:39:00,578
Were you some of the men...

1417
01:39:01,753 --> 01:39:03,854
...whose life Jimmy save?

1418
01:39:03,974 --> 01:39:08,578
They told me that he saved three
or four of his buddies, before...

1419
01:39:09,521 --> 01:39:11,515
Are you?

1420
01:39:13,225 --> 01:39:15,165
Were you?

1421
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:21,515
Yes ma'am, that was us.

1422
01:39:24,221 --> 01:39:27,855
Jimmy was a great guy.

1423
01:39:28,852 --> 01:39:31,647
Yeah, we've never forgotten him.

1424
01:39:32,716 --> 01:39:34,959
That's why we're here, ma'am.

1425
01:39:35,671 --> 01:39:38,092
We feel we owe him.

1426
01:39:40,932 --> 01:39:44,137
We just wanted to come
by and pay our respects.

1427
01:39:44,564 --> 01:39:48,980
Let you know that he's
always been in our hearts.

1428
01:39:51,535 --> 01:39:53,761
God bless you.

1429
01:39:55,150 --> 01:39:58,016
I can never thank you enough.

1430
01:40:02,597 --> 01:40:06,016
Ms. Hightower, very glad to have met you.

1431
01:40:06,136 --> 01:40:09,469
- Me too, son
- Thank you ma'am.

1432
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:11,312
Take care.

1433
01:40:12,701 --> 01:40:14,838
God bless you, Ms. Hightower

1434
01:41:14,225 --> 01:41:18,073
- Looks like they used to make things here.
- Used to.

1435
01:41:24,171 --> 01:41:27,144
That's the? Of word
"Used to".

1436
01:41:28,123 --> 01:41:29,957
Jeez, I got to piss.

1437
01:42:03,168 --> 01:42:04,848
Hey Mueller?

1438
01:42:05,685 --> 01:42:07,754
Now I see God.

1439
01:42:09,531 --> 01:42:12,650
If you had any more manners,
you would be a dog.

1440
01:43:26,760 --> 01:43:29,801
You gonna want to stay on here, alone?

1441
01:43:32,065 --> 01:43:34,871
I haven't really thought much about it.

1442
01:43:36,224 --> 01:43:38,019
Portsmouth?

1443
01:43:39,652 --> 01:43:41,745
With The brig right there.

1444
01:43:44,138 --> 01:43:46,432
You might want to try another place.

1445
01:43:46,692 --> 01:43:49,028
A fresh start.

1446
01:43:49,683 --> 01:43:52,404
But Larry would be here. Mary, too.

1447
01:43:53,084 --> 01:43:55,149
You could always visit.

1448
01:43:58,496 --> 01:44:01,074
You got close friends here?

1449
01:44:03,679 --> 01:44:05,374
Not too many.

1450
01:44:06,812 --> 01:44:08,636
Not too close.

1451
01:44:10,892 --> 01:44:15,393
Move to Norfolk.
You could work in my bar.

1452
01:44:16,262 --> 01:44:19,676
I don't know anything
about working in bar so..

1453
01:44:19,918 --> 01:44:22,924
Trust me - you don't need to know much.

1454
01:44:23,522 --> 01:44:27,061
Your bar don't seem all that busy.

1455
01:44:27,716 --> 01:44:30,977
But That's my fault.

1456
01:44:32,359 --> 01:44:35,744
It needs new blood.

1457
01:44:38,365 --> 01:44:41,484
We could get the grill part going again.

1458
01:44:43,097 --> 01:44:46,645
- I need a partner.
- A partner?

1459
01:44:47,911 --> 01:44:50,318
The bar'd be half yours,

1460
01:44:50,746 --> 01:44:53,960
- and when I bite it, it'll be all yours.
- you don't owe me nothing.

1461
01:44:54,080 --> 01:44:57,834
This ain't nothin' to do
with paying off no debt.

1462
01:44:58,561 --> 01:45:00,384
Trust me.

1463
01:45:00,897 --> 01:45:03,261
I really do need a partner.

1464
01:45:07,435 --> 01:45:10,590
You can stay with me for a while, -

1465
01:45:10,710 --> 01:45:15,546
but then you'd have to get your own place, 'cause
I like to pursue the ladies if you what I mean.

1466
01:45:16,462 --> 01:45:20,194
And quite frankly, no offense,
but you'd cramp my style.

1467
01:45:27,838 --> 01:45:29,889
You thinkin' about it?

1468
01:45:30,559 --> 01:45:32,937
I am. I'm picturing it.

1469
01:45:33,499 --> 01:45:35,450
It's kinda funny.

1470
01:45:39,296 --> 01:45:44,260
- Might be time for a new BCD in your life.
- Better career decision.

1471
01:45:45,521 --> 01:45:48,669
And if nothing else,
I guarantee it...

1472
01:45:49,894 --> 01:45:51,576
...we'd have some fun.

1473
01:45:54,254 --> 01:45:56,390
What's wrong with that?

1474
01:45:59,128 --> 01:46:02,034
You are in love with that thing.

1475
01:46:02,154 --> 01:46:05,310
I'm tryin' to get that
fucker O'Toole to answer.

1476
01:46:05,879 --> 01:46:08,721
The whole place could be
burned down for all I know.

1477
01:46:09,162 --> 01:46:10,857
Come on. You dick.

1478
01:46:17,615 --> 01:46:20,549
Here is Larry's graduation suit.

1479
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:23,982
Well, it's nice.

1480
01:46:24,541 --> 01:46:26,407
Looks a little small.

1481
01:46:26,527 --> 01:46:28,828
- Do you think?
- Yes sir.

1482
01:46:28,948 --> 01:46:33,748
Larry bulked up. That's might
be a little tight on him now.

1483
01:46:34,089 --> 01:46:37,622
I guess I could go down to Penny's
and get him something new.

1484
01:46:38,619 --> 01:46:41,667
We still got his dress blues.

1485
01:46:41,787 --> 01:46:44,098
Oh my word.

1486
01:46:44,525 --> 01:46:48,857
The dress blue uniform. Remember how
we used to call it, the tuxedo?

1487
01:46:50,214 --> 01:46:52,564
By law you wear to any formal function.

1488
01:46:52,684 --> 01:46:57,267
Not that we ever got invited to one...
or would have gone if we had.

1489
01:46:57,641 --> 01:47:02,071
Still, it was nice to know you were
always dressed for any occasion.

1490
01:47:02,374 --> 01:47:04,118
That's true.

1491
01:47:04,238 --> 01:47:08,391
Not a man ever forgets the first
time he puts on that uniform -

1492
01:47:08,890 --> 01:47:12,386
Then just standing in front of the
mirror lookin' at yourself, right?

1493
01:47:12,725 --> 01:47:17,415
I'm in the United States Marine Corps,
and I look pretty fuckin' good.

1494
01:47:17,569 --> 01:47:19,400
I remember loving that feeling.

1495
01:47:19,425 --> 01:47:22,342
Yes, sir. I'm glad to
know that never changes.

1496
01:47:23,137 --> 01:47:25,707
I bet Larry looked sharp in his.
Didn't he?

1497
01:47:25,732 --> 01:47:28,360
He did. He was proud
as a peacock in it.

1498
01:47:28,745 --> 01:47:31,647
I know that for a fact, sir.

1499
01:47:31,767 --> 01:47:35,302
You know, That's the point, Doc.
It's about pride.

1500
01:47:36,317 --> 01:47:40,002
- That is not a sin.
- Not that kind of pride.

1501
01:47:41,379 --> 01:47:45,278
I guess I could bury him in his uniform...

1502
01:47:45,563 --> 01:47:48,892
- ...even if.
- Yeah.

1503
01:47:49,177 --> 01:47:52,018
It means you did something.

1504
01:47:52,138 --> 01:47:55,605
Fuck what the politicians did, you served.

1505
01:47:55,739 --> 01:47:59,656
You didn't try weasel out of it. You
didn't think it was somebody else's job.

1506
01:47:59,776 --> 01:48:03,270
You took it on, man, and
you looked sharp doing it.

1507
01:48:03,390 --> 01:48:05,677
Like a man.

1508
01:48:07,084 --> 01:48:10,396
I'm gonna. I'm gonna
bury him in his uniform.

1509
01:48:11,838 --> 01:48:14,378
That's good, Doc.

1510
01:48:14,498 --> 01:48:17,493
Never regret it, sir.

1511
01:48:25,271 --> 01:48:27,657
Hey. Washington?

1512
01:48:28,019 --> 01:48:31,082
Do you ever relax?
I want you to sit down.

1513
01:48:35,293 --> 01:48:36,878
That's it huh?

1514
01:48:39,655 --> 01:48:41,631
Yeah. Much better.

1515
01:49:05,237 --> 01:49:08,118
Why're you looking at me like that?

1516
01:49:08,776 --> 01:49:11,216
I'm sizin' you up.

1517
01:49:12,302 --> 01:49:14,420
You know what?

1518
01:49:14,865 --> 01:49:18,249
I'm gonna get you a new suit of clothes.

1519
01:49:19,228 --> 01:49:21,098
Say what?

1520
01:49:21,418 --> 01:49:23,964
I'm gonna dress you up for the occasion.

1521
01:49:24,084 --> 01:49:26,350
May I ask why?

1522
01:49:27,968 --> 01:49:30,710
Because I love you.

1523
01:49:38,802 --> 01:49:42,719
First of all, I don't need
a new suit of clothes.

1524
01:49:43,039 --> 01:49:47,971
Second of all, you're the one who
could really use some grooming.

1525
01:49:48,603 --> 01:49:53,321
- And third of all, Neither one of us is dressed
properly, or we're gonna be. You watch.

1526
01:49:54,033 --> 01:49:58,341
- The things that come into your head and out of your mouth.
- Scary, right?

1527
01:49:59,310 --> 01:50:01,500
Do you know what I think?

1528
01:50:01,620 --> 01:50:04,900
I think that "I love you" thing
rattled you, didn't it, old man?

1529
01:50:05,020 --> 01:50:07,197
Deeply disturbing.

1530
01:52:03,853 --> 01:52:07,703
Doc, I don't know how
grateful the nation is...

1531
01:52:07,988 --> 01:52:11,745
...or how much the
President regrets your loss.

1532
01:52:12,831 --> 01:52:15,591
But here it is.

1533
01:52:17,012 --> 01:52:19,273
Your country's flag.

1534
01:52:21,516 --> 01:52:23,030
Thank you.

1535
01:52:23,973 --> 01:52:28,693
Put that somewhere and let it remind
you of what's in your son's heart.

1536
01:53:06,841 --> 01:53:09,606
Well, once you're a marine,
you're always a marine.

1537
01:53:09,726 --> 01:53:12,668
Even though I'm no longer on active duty

1538
01:53:12,788 --> 01:53:17,107
But if I was, I ask you, you
see a man in this uniform huh?

1539
01:53:17,208 --> 01:53:20,483
Could you resist all this?

1540
01:53:20,508 --> 01:53:23,961
- No, I don't think I could.

1541
01:53:24,478 --> 01:53:28,926
- Is the uniform or the man in the uniform?
- It's a killer combination.

1542
01:53:30,363 --> 01:53:32,215
Kind of seductive.

1543
01:53:32,335 --> 01:53:35,864
Thank you. You are a very
perceptive young lady.

1544
01:53:46,412 --> 01:53:48,816
We all wrote one.

1545
01:53:49,617 --> 01:53:53,387
I gave mine to Larry, he gave his to me.

1546
01:54:00,722 --> 01:54:02,894
What does it say?

1547
01:54:04,461 --> 01:54:07,434
I don't know, Mr. Shepherd.

1548
01:54:11,907 --> 01:54:13,278
Okay.

1549
01:54:38,500 --> 01:54:42,791
I'm just saying when you think about it,
a young man is struggling out on a date.

1550
01:54:42,911 --> 01:54:46,913
Goes out a date, he has to borrow his dad's
car, needs to borrow a couple of bucks

1551
01:54:47,026 --> 01:54:50,484
Whereas an older, established gentlemen.
He does not have to do anything of that.

1552
01:54:50,758 --> 01:54:54,070
- Sal? I need you to come with me
- Can't you see, I'm a little busy.

1553
01:54:54,190 --> 01:54:56,857
I'm gonna have to borrow him for a moment.

1554
01:54:56,977 --> 01:55:00,400
- Does it have to happen right now?
- Right now. Doc needs us.

1555
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:04,388
I'll be right back, we'll pick this up.

1556
01:55:04,508 --> 01:55:06,738
Bye, Sarge.

1557
01:55:26,157 --> 01:55:28,896
You got to open it, Doc.

1558
01:55:35,936 --> 01:55:38,588
He wanted you to have it.

1559
01:55:58,388 --> 01:56:02,278
"Dear Dad. If you are reading
this, then you've been notified."

1560
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:06,400
"I was always prepared to sacrifice
my life for my country."

1561
01:56:06,716 --> 01:56:09,885
"You have to be ready to die
defending what you love."

1562
01:56:10,259 --> 01:56:13,855
"I need you to understand that I
am honored to die in this way."

1563
01:56:13,975 --> 01:56:18,005
"Don't feel bad that my life was so short.
It was a good life."

1564
01:56:18,557 --> 01:56:21,085
"I know you never wanted
me to join the Marines,

1565
01:56:21,205 --> 01:56:24,059
but you supported me even so."

1566
01:56:24,557 --> 01:56:27,950
"I had the greatest father and I love you."

1567
01:56:28,070 --> 01:56:31,831
"Now I am with mom. We
will both watch over you."

1568
01:56:32,098 --> 01:56:36,104
"Dad, I want you to bury me
in my uniform, next to Mom."

1569
01:56:36,949 --> 01:56:39,726
"Your loving son, Larry."
