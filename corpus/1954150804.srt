2
00:00:01,896 --> 00:00:03,463
- My name is Meg Murphy.

3
00:00:03,465 --> 00:00:04,764
This is my street.

4
00:00:04,766 --> 00:00:07,700
And this is my house.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:12,338
That's me.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:13,639
Hi.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,177
Okay, not the best first impression.

8
00:00:17,179 --> 00:00:20,582
Let's skip ahead.

9
00:00:20,584 --> 00:00:21,650
Much better.

10
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:23,552
So as I was saying,
i'm Meg Murphy,

11
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,220
And today begins what I know

12
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:26,821
Will be the
greatest summer ever.

13
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:28,423
Being me can be exhausting.

14
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:29,991
My life is a little...

15
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:31,192
strange.

16
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:32,294
But it's not just me.

17
00:00:32,296 --> 00:00:33,461
My whole family is different.

18
00:00:33,463 --> 00:00:34,496
Hi, Mom.
- Good morning.

19
00:00:34,498 --> 00:00:36,098
- Morning, trouble.

20
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,098
Morning, Dad.

21
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,300
- Good morning, beautiful.

22
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:39,434
No, not you, harold.

23
00:00:39,436 --> 00:00:40,769
Yes, you do
have beautiful eyes.

24
00:00:40,771 --> 00:00:42,004
- We may look normal,

25
00:00:42,006 --> 00:00:43,973
But we're not like
other families exactly.

26
00:00:43,975 --> 00:00:44,974
- So how did you sleep?

27
00:00:44,976 --> 00:00:46,309
- Great.

28
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:48,244
I was only woken up once
when a bat flew into my room

29
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:49,512
And got stuck in my pillowcase.

30
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:51,080
- Oh, that's good.

31
00:00:51,082 --> 00:00:53,449
That's so much better than the
angry badgers from last week.

32
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:54,550
- Yeah.

33
00:00:54,552 --> 00:00:56,118
- Well, it looks
like somebody's summer

34
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,319
Is getting off to a good start.

35
00:00:57,321 --> 00:00:58,487
I know you don't like bacon.

36
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:00,422
There's cereal up there.

37
00:01:00,424 --> 00:01:01,724
- Easy enough.

38
00:01:01,726 --> 00:01:05,595
Just go get that cereal up there
on the shelf, right?

39
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,464
Just use the ladder

40
00:01:08,466 --> 00:01:10,433
Or a stool.

41
00:01:11,968 --> 00:01:13,635
- And the second one...

42
00:01:27,019 --> 00:01:28,551
Nobody move.

43
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:34,657
- Hi, baby.

44
00:01:35,826 --> 00:01:37,393
Yeah, give Mommy the orange.

45
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:38,994
Give Mommy the orange, baby.

46
00:01:38,996 --> 00:01:40,329
Give Mommy the orange.

47
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:41,597
Okay, give it to Mommy.

48
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,266
That's a good girl.

49
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:44,267
Give Mommy the orange...

50
00:01:44,269 --> 00:01:45,535
No!

51
00:01:46,538 --> 00:01:47,537
- Oh-Ho-Ho!

52
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:48,604
- Oh!

53
00:01:48,606 --> 00:01:49,605
Ugh!

54
00:01:49,607 --> 00:01:51,040
- Ooh!

55
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:52,274
Oh, not the bacon.

56
00:02:07,224 --> 00:02:08,790
- Okay, troops,
time to evacuate.

57
00:02:08,792 --> 00:02:10,058
- Charlie, time to go.

58
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,893
- Be right there, Dad!

59
00:02:11,895 --> 00:02:14,362
- Whoo-Hoo!

60
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:16,598
Whoa!

61
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,768
- Oh, I know.
It's such a bummer.

62
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:21,136
- Oh, that was so awesome.

63
00:02:21,138 --> 00:02:22,537
I got it on video.

64
00:02:22,539 --> 00:02:24,406
- Walk briskly to the exit,
everyone.

65
00:02:24,408 --> 00:02:26,575
- Okay, kids, grab
your emergency suitcases.

66
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:30,278
- Okay, boys and girls,
time to go.

67
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,412
- Now I know.

68
00:02:31,414 --> 00:02:33,247
- Out the door, charlie.
- Move, move, move.

69
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:34,682
- Let's go!
Let's go!

70
00:02:36,285 --> 00:02:38,485
- It's a good thing we have
insurance on speed dial, huh?

71
00:02:38,487 --> 00:02:39,719
- Yeah.
Come on, charlie.

72
00:03:00,941 --> 00:03:02,108
- Let me get my camera.

73
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,109
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

74
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,376
Charlie, i'll get it.

75
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,383
Heh.
Hey.

76
00:03:11,385 --> 00:03:12,818
It still works.

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
- Not again.

78
00:03:24,965 --> 00:03:26,565
?

79
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:45,983
Clank!

80
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,211
Splorch!

81
00:04:28,892 --> 00:04:30,459
Boof!

82
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,070
- I wish I were normal.

83
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:15,172
I wish I could tell you
that our house falling down

84
00:05:15,174 --> 00:05:16,941
Was a once-In-A-Lifetime thing.

85
00:05:16,943 --> 00:05:19,209
But this was the fourth time
it had happened...

86
00:05:19,211 --> 00:05:20,744
This year.

87
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:23,181
The local hotels have
all politely told us

88
00:05:23,183 --> 00:05:25,316
We're never, ever allowed back.

89
00:05:25,318 --> 00:05:28,553
So this time we're staying with
our grandpa in harvest hills.

90
00:05:28,555 --> 00:05:30,087
Boing!

91
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,355
- Oh!
Honey. Oh.

92
00:05:31,357 --> 00:05:32,356
Honey.

93
00:05:32,358 --> 00:05:33,524
- Okay.
- Yeah, i'm stuck.

94
00:05:33,526 --> 00:05:34,659
No, it's even worse.

95
00:05:34,661 --> 00:05:36,461
- Okay, stop, just...
- Yeah, okay, go ahead.

96
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:37,495
- Let me.
- Yeah, just...

97
00:05:37,497 --> 00:05:38,529
Okay, got it?

98
00:05:38,531 --> 00:05:39,898
That's the sweet spot...

99
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,099
- here's the deal:

100
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,600
My family is jinxed.

101
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:45,003
100 years ago,
a witch put a magical curse

102
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,239
On my great great grandfather
tommy Murphy,

103
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:49,174
And now every Murphy since then

104
00:05:49,176 --> 00:05:50,575
Has been stuck with bad luck.

105
00:05:52,512 --> 00:05:54,446
This isn't just any bad luck.

106
00:05:54,448 --> 00:05:57,416
I mean, reputation-Tanking,
life-Frazzling bad luck.

107
00:05:57,418 --> 00:05:59,084
We call it Murphy's law.

108
00:05:59,086 --> 00:06:00,686
If anything can go wrong,

109
00:06:00,688 --> 00:06:02,054
It will.

110
00:06:04,558 --> 00:06:06,058
But we figured out how
to deal with it.

111
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,259
When you're a Murphy,

112
00:06:07,261 --> 00:06:09,161
You have to see things
a little bit differently

113
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,662
Than everyone else.

114
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,641
- What?
- What?

115
00:06:25,078 --> 00:06:27,645
- Mom and Dad taught us being
a Murphy makes us special,

116
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:29,147
But that's a little harder
to believe

117
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,415
Now that i'm in high school.

118
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:32,150
As you can imagine,

119
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:35,421
Being a walking disaster
does not equal popularity.

120
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:37,090
People tend to run away
from me,

121
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,026
Hurricane Meg.

122
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:48,369
You might think i'm exaggerating
the whole curse,

123
00:06:48,371 --> 00:06:50,104
That i'm just accident-Prone.

124
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:52,974
Nope.

125
00:06:52,976 --> 00:06:54,575
The curse is real.

126
00:07:00,016 --> 00:07:01,516
It's magic,

127
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:03,518
And it's out to get me.

128
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,854
I want to do something important
with my life,

129
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:07,622
Like become a famous scientist

130
00:07:07,624 --> 00:07:09,458
And discover
the cure for pimples.

131
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,767
But it turns out
science is no match

132
00:07:18,769 --> 00:07:20,202
For an evil spell.

133
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:23,072
I guess I should settle for just
trying not to kill anybody.

134
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,173
- Next up,

135
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:26,542
Meg Murphy.

136
00:07:26,544 --> 00:07:27,976
- I've tried to be normal,

137
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,811
But I don't even need
to finish this sentence

138
00:07:29,813 --> 00:07:32,147
Because i'm sure
you've already figured out

139
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:34,015
How that worked out for me.

140
00:07:36,485 --> 00:07:38,419
Ready?
Okay.

141
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,257
- Oh!

142
00:07:46,964 --> 00:07:48,932
- But in the whole history
of Murphys,

143
00:07:48,934 --> 00:07:50,967
No one's figured out how
to break the curse.

144
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:52,468
Whenever I ask my parents
about it,

145
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:54,069
They change the subject.

146
00:07:54,071 --> 00:07:55,738
Twang!

147
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,215
- Hi.
Sorry about this.

148
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,217
Let me grab it.
Honk!

149
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,385
My house is...
Hold on a sec.

150
00:08:08,387 --> 00:08:09,486
- Come on!

151
00:08:09,488 --> 00:08:12,589
- Ha-Ha!
Oh, this is awkward.

152
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:13,590
Go ahead.

153
00:08:13,592 --> 00:08:14,658
Go ahead.
I'll go.

154
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,194
- If this curse had
a magical cause,

155
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,230
It must have a magical solution.

156
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:20,498
I've got to find it this summer

157
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,166
So I can leave
all this baggage behind me

158
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:23,301
And start high school,

159
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:24,869
Normal.

160
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,183
Home sweet home
for the time being.

161
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,852
This'll be fun, right, gang?

162
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,654
Hanging with grandpa.

163
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,789
24/7.

164
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:52,763
- Oh, I totally forgot
about the second floor balcony.

165
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,631
It's perfect
for a skating trick.

166
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:57,032
Oh, I can fly up the ramp
to the railing,

167
00:08:57,034 --> 00:08:58,567
And then I could jump
to the roof

168
00:08:58,569 --> 00:08:59,901
And then skate the roof ridge,

169
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,436
And then ollie back
to the windowsill

170
00:09:01,438 --> 00:09:02,504
And grind it,

171
00:09:02,506 --> 00:09:03,538
And then fall from my board

172
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,406
And crash onto the side
of the house.

173
00:09:05,408 --> 00:09:07,775
Oh, Dad, you
could totally film it.

174
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:09,845
It would be epic.

175
00:09:09,847 --> 00:09:12,314
- That's my annoying
little brother, charlie.

176
00:09:12,316 --> 00:09:14,249
You might recognize him
as internet sensation

177
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:17,152
Skater fail boy.

178
00:09:17,154 --> 00:09:20,955
He's famous for his videos of
him doing crazy skating tricks.

179
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:22,690
And failing.

180
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:25,092
It's, like, his thing.

181
00:09:25,094 --> 00:09:27,061
Clunk!

182
00:09:28,164 --> 00:09:30,698
- Yeah!

183
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,900
- Uh-Uh-Uh-Uh!

184
00:09:31,902 --> 00:09:34,035
Just stay epic down here
on the ground, buddy.

185
00:09:35,605 --> 00:09:38,006
- The Murphy's have a strict
policy against heights.

186
00:09:38,008 --> 00:09:39,641
I mean, even people
who aren't cursed

187
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:41,176
Get hurt falling
from high places.

188
00:09:41,178 --> 00:09:44,112
Charlie's the only one
who ignores the family motto.

189
00:09:44,114 --> 00:09:48,383
All: climb over three feet,
you're dead meat.

190
00:09:48,385 --> 00:09:49,717
- Um...

191
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,253
what's that?

192
00:09:52,255 --> 00:09:56,592
- Yeah, why does the front door
look like it's about to fart.

193
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,060
Thoonk!

194
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:04,433
Whoa.

195
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,802
- Grandpa has had the curse
a lot longer than any of us,

196
00:10:06,804 --> 00:10:10,206
And has found interesting ways
to deal with it.

197
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:11,207
- Hi, Dad.

198
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,376
- Oh, hi.

199
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:14,443
- Hey, grandpa.

200
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:15,778
A giant bubble, huh?

201
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,113
That's new.

202
00:10:17,115 --> 00:10:18,648
- Yeah, great find, right?

203
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:21,384
I never go outside
without it now.

204
00:10:21,386 --> 00:10:22,652
Never.

205
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:24,888
Look.

206
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,658
It's a flock
of migrating geese.

207
00:10:33,364 --> 00:10:35,496
- Majestic creatures.

208
00:10:44,306 --> 00:10:46,374
Oh, i'm so happy
you're all here.

209
00:10:48,678 --> 00:10:51,346
I can't believe how much
you've grown.

210
00:10:51,348 --> 00:10:54,516
Now, kids, you remember
where your rooms are, right?

211
00:10:54,518 --> 00:10:56,852
Get!

212
00:10:56,854 --> 00:10:59,087
- Wow. I love what you've done
with the place, Dad.

213
00:10:59,089 --> 00:11:00,122
All the memories and...

214
00:11:00,124 --> 00:11:02,591
No, don't even think about it.

215
00:11:02,593 --> 00:11:03,959
- Be careful.

216
00:11:03,961 --> 00:11:06,395
I haven't had time
to baby-Proof the house yet.

217
00:11:06,397 --> 00:11:09,131
See, all this
is just Murphy-Proofed.

218
00:11:09,133 --> 00:11:11,334
- Since my baby sister georgia
can't walk yet,

219
00:11:11,336 --> 00:11:13,335
The curse doesn't affect her
too much for now.

220
00:11:13,337 --> 00:11:15,605
But it sure does make
Mom's life harder.

221
00:11:15,607 --> 00:11:17,340
- My little georgia want
some peaches?

222
00:11:17,342 --> 00:11:18,407
Here it comes.

223
00:11:26,349 --> 00:11:27,849
Okay.

224
00:11:27,851 --> 00:11:29,651
So that's a no on the peaches.

225
00:11:32,088 --> 00:11:34,023
- Oh, uh, this...

226
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:36,159
was dropped off
for you earlier, son.

227
00:11:36,161 --> 00:11:38,161
I...

228
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:41,130
Oh-Ho-Ho-Ho.

229
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:45,000
Test case number 456
for Murphy's machinations.

230
00:11:46,337 --> 00:11:48,503
- Murphy's machinations
is my Dad's company.

231
00:11:48,505 --> 00:11:51,540
It's hard to keep a job when
you're cursed by Murphy's law.

232
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:52,541
- Thanks.
Have a good day.

233
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:53,543
Bye-Bye.

234
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:54,810
Oh.

235
00:11:54,812 --> 00:11:56,712
Uh...

236
00:11:56,714 --> 00:11:58,047
smack!

237
00:11:58,049 --> 00:11:59,916
Hi.

238
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,288
Whoa! Whoa!

239
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,026
- But Dad found a way
to turn the curse

240
00:12:10,028 --> 00:12:11,627
Into a business opportunity.

241
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:13,596
He tests out new products
for defects.

242
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:17,967
This glue is guaranteed
to create a lifetime hold.

243
00:12:17,969 --> 00:12:21,136
Not much of a guarantee
if you ask me.

244
00:12:21,138 --> 00:12:23,105
If there's a flaw, i'll find it

245
00:12:23,107 --> 00:12:24,439
And help you fix it.

246
00:12:24,441 --> 00:12:26,441
If something can go wrong,
it will

247
00:12:26,443 --> 00:12:29,278
With mark Murphy.

248
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,679
- We're still rolling.

249
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,088
- Wow.

250
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,356
Wow.

251
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:41,024
Looks expensive.

252
00:12:41,026 --> 00:12:43,259
Can't wait to break it.

253
00:12:43,261 --> 00:12:46,629
They call it
the insta cookie 3000.

254
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,665
It's made
by matayama industries.

255
00:12:48,667 --> 00:12:50,333
If I could figure out
what could go wrong

256
00:12:50,335 --> 00:12:51,801
With this by monday,

257
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:53,569
They said I could test
all their products,

258
00:12:53,571 --> 00:12:55,906
Which could mean big time...

259
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,909
For the whole family.

260
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:00,811
- Wait.
What's this mean?

261
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,880
- Money.

262
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,749
- Oh.

263
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,818
Hey, Dad,
can I have some of this?

264
00:13:09,722 --> 00:13:10,921
No.

265
00:13:18,062 --> 00:13:21,031
- Ah, the Murphy wall of fame,
huh?

266
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,666
Oh.

267
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,868
This one's Daddy.

268
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:31,343
Okay, I know it's not
your best scenario

269
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:32,343
For your summer.

270
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:33,377
- Best?

271
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:34,945
Try even worse
than my worst nightmare.

272
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,213
- Okay.

273
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:37,648
Well, I know it's not home,

274
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,550
But harvest hills
is a nice little town.

275
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:42,720
I think you could have
a lot of fun here.

276
00:13:42,722 --> 00:13:44,455
Oh, oh, look.

277
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,856
A science camp for teenagers

278
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,326
At the university.

279
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:50,128
You just fill out
the application.

280
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,229
- Seriously, Mom?

281
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,464
Do you know what would happen

282
00:13:52,466 --> 00:13:54,165
If a Murphy was let loose
in a science lab?

283
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:58,035
I'm sorry!

284
00:13:58,037 --> 00:14:01,439
I didn't think you could
actually release the kraken.

285
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,841
- What?

286
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:04,875
We're cursed.

287
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:06,076
It could happen.

288
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:07,778
- Meg, everyone has problems.

289
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,680
It is not just us, okay?

290
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:11,248
How you handle it
is what matters.

291
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,584
- You know the best way
to handle our problems?

292
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,618
Get rid of the curse.

293
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,986
- Okay, sweetie.

294
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,354
Could you just let it go,
maybe,

295
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,422
And enjoy your vacation?

296
00:14:18,424 --> 00:14:19,857
- But there's got to be a way.

297
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,060
I mean, I can't go through
three more years of high school

298
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,060
As hurricane Meg.

299
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:25,096
You know what?
I know.

300
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,565
I know what will
make you feel better.

301
00:14:26,567 --> 00:14:27,733
Here.

302
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,568
Yes, I am paying you off
to be a happy daughter.

303
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,271
Seriously, you should just go
and buy yourself

304
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:33,939
A whole new summer wardrobe.

305
00:14:33,941 --> 00:14:35,975
You deserve it.

306
00:14:35,977 --> 00:14:37,643
- My suitcase got left behind?

307
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:39,245
- Yeah.

308
00:14:42,149 --> 00:14:44,049
- ? it's a cruel ?

309
00:14:44,051 --> 00:14:46,918

You.

322
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,525
- Ivy murray,

323
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:28,961
Aka the meanest girl
in the history of mean girls,

324
00:15:28,963 --> 00:15:31,430
Aka the bane of my existence,

325
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:34,066
Aka...
Oh, no.

326
00:15:34,068 --> 00:15:35,534
- What are you doing here?

327
00:15:35,536 --> 00:15:37,170
- Well, my grandpa lives here,
so...

328
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:38,871
- Here?
In harvest hills?

329
00:15:38,873 --> 00:15:40,707
But this is my town.

330
00:15:40,709 --> 00:15:42,242
I come here every summer,

331
00:15:42,244 --> 00:15:43,543
And you're not invited.

332
00:15:43,545 --> 00:15:46,046
- Trust me. I am just as unhappy
about this as you are.

333
00:15:46,048 --> 00:15:47,647
- My summer's ruined.

334
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:50,049
My life is ruined.

335
00:15:50,051 --> 00:15:53,853
Give me that.

336
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:58,826
This town is supposed
to be a hurricane Meg-Free zone.

337
00:15:58,828 --> 00:16:00,928
- Of all the towns we could
have come to this summer,

338
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,530
It had to be here?

339
00:16:02,532 --> 00:16:04,465
Harvest hills is horrible.

340
00:16:04,467 --> 00:16:06,334
This is going to be
the worst summer ever.

341
00:16:08,671 --> 00:16:10,538
- Hold on.

342
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,240
I found these
monkey socks first.

343
00:16:12,242 --> 00:16:15,042
And finders keepers.

344
00:16:15,044 --> 00:16:16,043
These must be yours.

345
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:17,278
- Yeah.

346
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,113
- I would definitely rock
those socks, though.

347
00:16:19,115 --> 00:16:20,114
- Thanks.

348
00:16:20,116 --> 00:16:21,216
I'm embarrassed.

349
00:16:21,218 --> 00:16:23,017
- Well, hi, embarrassed.
I'm brett.

350
00:16:23,019 --> 00:16:24,586
- It's Meg, actually.

351
00:16:24,588 --> 00:16:26,354
- Well, nice to meet you, Meg.

352
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:27,689
Are you from harvest hills?

353
00:16:27,691 --> 00:16:28,990
I haven't seen you before.

354
00:16:28,992 --> 00:16:31,560
- No, i'm just here
visiting my bees.

355
00:16:31,562 --> 00:16:32,894
I mean, my grandpa.

356
00:16:32,896 --> 00:16:34,128
Well, not visiting.

357
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,830
I guess i'm kind of living here
this summer.

358
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:36,998
My house, it, uh,

359
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,299
Kind of fell down.

360
00:16:38,301 --> 00:16:39,333
So many bees.

361
00:16:39,335 --> 00:16:40,802
- Well, welcome.

362
00:16:40,804 --> 00:16:42,970
You're actually just in time
for the harvest festival.

363
00:16:42,972 --> 00:16:44,071
- I can see.

364
00:16:44,073 --> 00:16:45,373
- There's tons of fun stuff
to do.

365
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:46,441
It lasts all week.

366
00:16:46,443 --> 00:16:48,109
And every year
they pick one person

367
00:16:48,111 --> 00:16:50,445
To lower the flag
at the closing ceremony.

368
00:16:50,447 --> 00:16:51,913
Guess who they picked
this year.

369
00:16:51,915 --> 00:16:53,682
- Who?

370
00:16:53,684 --> 00:16:55,383
I have no idea.

371
00:16:55,385 --> 00:16:56,584
Wait.

372
00:16:56,586 --> 00:16:57,618
Is it you?

373
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,886
- Yes.
Jeez.

374
00:16:58,888 --> 00:17:00,321
Took you long enough.

375
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,589
I'll have you know
it's a very big honor.

376
00:17:02,591 --> 00:17:04,358
Get to shake hands
with the mayor.

377
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,126
Get a really snazzy t-Shirt.

378
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:08,262
- You know, we can never
have too many t-Shirts.

379
00:17:09,265 --> 00:17:11,632
- Smooth, Meg.

380
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:13,901
- Well, anyway,
um, you should come.

381
00:17:13,903 --> 00:17:17,105
There's gonna be a picnic
and a fair.

382
00:17:17,107 --> 00:17:18,906
And a dance.

383
00:17:18,908 --> 00:17:20,307
You've got to come
to the dance.

384
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:21,308
- I do?

385
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,209
- Sure.
It's a town tradition.

386
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,344
You don't want to hurt
the town's feelings, do you?

387
00:17:25,346 --> 00:17:27,747
- I guess not.

388
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:29,148
- Um...

389
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,616
let me help you
with the rest of these.

390
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:31,885
- Thanks.

391
00:17:31,887 --> 00:17:33,620
Omg, he doesn't know
i'm hurricane Meg.

392
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:34,721
Mom was right.

393
00:17:34,723 --> 00:17:36,089
Harvest hills is awesome.

394
00:17:36,091 --> 00:17:37,991
This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

395
00:17:37,993 --> 00:17:40,394
If only this bee
would leave me alone.

396
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:41,595
Smack!
- Ow!

397
00:17:41,597 --> 00:17:43,264
- Oh, I am so sorry.
I really didn't mean to.

398
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:45,032
- Wow. You got a strong
right hook there, Meg.

399
00:17:45,034 --> 00:17:46,500
- Oh, my god.
- Oh!

400
00:17:46,502 --> 00:17:47,501
- I'm so sorry.

401
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:48,668
No, no, it was an accident.

402
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,004
Here you go.
It was very nice to meet you.

403
00:17:51,006 --> 00:17:52,238
- Nice to meet you.

404
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,439
Sorry.

405
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:54,774
- It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

406
00:17:54,776 --> 00:17:57,710
- Okay, curse, this means war.

407
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:03,916
- Butt balloon activate!

408
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,351
- Sorry, grandpa.

409
00:18:05,353 --> 00:18:06,519
Cool invention.

410
00:18:06,521 --> 00:18:08,954
- Oh, it's handy
for napping anywhere.

411
00:18:08,956 --> 00:18:11,724
- This stupid curse
is ruining my life.

412
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:15,094
I mean, look at the things
this family has gone through.

413
00:18:15,096 --> 00:18:17,729
"Hiccupping man causes
circus stampede."

414
00:18:17,731 --> 00:18:19,598
Okay, "man throws coin
in fountain,

415
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,866
Floods town."

416
00:18:20,868 --> 00:18:22,068
- That was a lot of water.

417
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,170
- "Local youth
invents homework."

418
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,472
The Murphys invented homework?
Really?

419
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:28,941
- It's been 100 years.

420
00:18:28,943 --> 00:18:30,443
Why has no one ever tried
to break it?

421
00:18:30,445 --> 00:18:31,444
- Oh, we've tried.
- Dad.

422
00:18:31,446 --> 00:18:32,812
- Oh.

423
00:18:32,814 --> 00:18:34,781
- What? Grandpa, is there
a way to break the curse?

424
00:18:34,783 --> 00:18:36,816
- There are certain things
a Murphy must never do...

425
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:38,318
Needlepoint, whale watching.

426
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,020
But messing with the curse
is at the top of the list.

427
00:18:41,022 --> 00:18:42,188
- So you admit you've tried it.

428
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,389
What do you do?

429
00:18:43,391 --> 00:18:44,557
Do you got to a fortune-Teller

430
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,025
Or do a seance
or find a spell in a book?

431
00:18:46,027 --> 00:18:47,694
- Ha! There's a book.

432
00:18:47,696 --> 00:18:49,162
- Enough, Meg.

433
00:18:49,164 --> 00:18:52,231
We've told you before
that the curse can't be broken.

434
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:54,700
So don't make yourself miserable
by trying.

435
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:56,969
- Okay, so I guess I should just
stay miserable not trying.

436
00:18:56,971 --> 00:18:57,970
- That is not what I meant.

437
00:18:57,972 --> 00:18:59,205
- Trust us, Meg.

438
00:18:59,207 --> 00:19:01,607
There are fates worse
than Murphy's law.

439
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:07,446
- She's getting too curious.

440
00:19:07,448 --> 00:19:09,415
She doesn't know the chaos
that she can cause.

441
00:19:09,417 --> 00:19:10,416
She'll...

442
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:11,817
- She won't find
the diary, son.

443
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,152
- But if she did...
- Won't.

444
00:19:13,154 --> 00:19:14,319
- I'm just saying...
- Shush.

445
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,788
- I'm playing devil's...
- Nope.

446
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:18,090
- Every time i...
- No.

447
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:23,329
- I looked everywhere
for this... This book,

448
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:24,797
But things are easily hidden

449
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,666
In grandpa's big old house.

450
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:31,237
And I probably should have
remembered Murphy rule 51.

451
00:19:33,274 --> 00:19:35,107
Never use matches.

452
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,776
Whoa!

453
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:00,363
Grandpa was right.

454
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,732
I didn't find the diary.

455
00:20:03,901 --> 00:20:05,568
The diary found me.

456
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:14,154
- Hey, hey to all my fans.

457
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:15,689
I just made a new invention

458
00:20:15,691 --> 00:20:18,559
That's gonna make my videos
even more awesome than before.

459
00:20:18,561 --> 00:20:21,595
The dizzy cam.

460
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,964
World, you are so not ready
for this.

461
00:20:23,966 --> 00:20:25,633
- Dude, this is gonna be
so rad.

462
00:20:25,635 --> 00:20:27,034
- Dude, I know, right?

463
00:20:27,036 --> 00:20:29,437
- Let's go.
- All right.

464
00:20:29,439 --> 00:20:32,306
- Go, go, go!

465
00:20:32,308 --> 00:20:34,008
- You got this!

466
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,811
Whoa!

467
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:38,446
- Charlie's never landed
a trick

468
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:40,214
Thanks to Murphy's curse.

469
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:41,616
But he doesn't care.

470
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:43,451
He doesn't even try
to be a good skater.

471
00:20:43,453 --> 00:20:47,188
His fans just want
to see a cyclone on wheels.

472
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:48,222
- Yeah!

473
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:50,625
- Whoa!

474
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:52,260
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

475
00:20:52,262 --> 00:20:54,429
Whoa!
Whoa!

476
00:20:54,431 --> 00:20:55,463
- Whoa.

478
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,608
- June 22, 1914.

479
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:11,879
- Hi, honey.

480
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,013
I'm gonna run to the store

481
00:21:13,015 --> 00:21:14,248
Because georgia has graduated

482
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:16,249
To the industrial strength
diapers.

483
00:21:16,251 --> 00:21:18,317
So, uh, I could drop you off
in town.

484
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,553
You could go do things.

485
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:21,788
Kids your age,

486
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,724
They have places they like
to go, hang out, right?

487
00:21:23,726 --> 00:21:25,860
You could get down.

488
00:21:25,862 --> 00:21:27,295
- No, thanks, Mom.

489
00:21:27,297 --> 00:21:28,562
- You sure?

490
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:30,163
- Yeah.

491
00:21:30,165 --> 00:21:31,364
- Okay.

492
00:21:31,366 --> 00:21:32,798
Bye.

493
00:21:42,542 --> 00:21:44,110
- "Tonight is the harvest dance,

494
00:21:44,112 --> 00:21:45,211
And i, tommy Murphy..."

495
00:21:45,213 --> 00:21:47,914
- Am the luckiest man around.

496
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:06,199
A man once said to me,

497
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:09,602
"Tommy Murphy, you're
the luckiest guy around."

498
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:10,704
And you know what?

499
00:22:10,706 --> 00:22:13,072
Today I feel like I am.

500
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:46,203
Yes!

501
00:22:46,205 --> 00:22:47,972
Yeah!

502
00:22:53,479 --> 00:22:55,980
?

503
00:22:55,982 --> 00:22:58,216
And tonight I bet
i'm gonna end up

504
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:00,918
With the prettiest girl
in town.

505
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,220
- Hi, tommy.

506
00:23:02,222 --> 00:23:04,289
- No, not violet.

507
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,557
Caitlin o'leary.

508
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,193
Now, some townsfolk think
she's a witch,

509
00:23:09,195 --> 00:23:11,096
But I think that's just silly.

510
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:14,199
Everyone knows there's
no such thing as magic.

511
00:23:14,201 --> 00:23:17,469
Although she's certainly
put a spell on me.

512
00:23:24,012 --> 00:23:26,178
- Will you dance with me,
tommy?

513
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:29,314
- I don't know.

514
00:23:29,316 --> 00:23:32,650
I'm not a very good dancer.

515
00:23:32,652 --> 00:23:34,718
But i'll tell you what.

516
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,489
I will let
my lucky coin decide.

517
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:41,191
Heads, yes.

518
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:42,793
Tails...

519
00:24:07,351 --> 00:24:09,018
- Tommy.

520
00:24:10,353 --> 00:24:11,420
- Mm, mm...

521
00:24:11,422 --> 00:24:12,822
No!

522
00:24:17,461 --> 00:24:19,061
Caitlin.

523
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,598
No, it's...
It's not what it looks like.

524
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,067
Caitlin, wait!

525
00:24:24,069 --> 00:24:26,402
Caitlin, stop!

526
00:24:29,574 --> 00:24:31,273
- Caitlin!

527
00:24:31,275 --> 00:24:34,477
Caitlin.

528
00:24:34,479 --> 00:24:36,979
Caitlin, come on.
Come back to the dance.

529
00:24:36,981 --> 00:24:39,782
- I never want to talk
to you again, tommy Murphy.

530
00:24:39,784 --> 00:24:42,385
- Violet means nothing to me.

531
00:24:42,387 --> 00:24:44,554
So you're wearing
grandma's underwear.

532
00:24:44,556 --> 00:24:46,556
I don't care.

533
00:24:46,558 --> 00:24:49,125
- You still want to dance with me?

534
00:24:49,127 --> 00:24:50,793
I'll flip you for it.

535
00:24:50,795 --> 00:24:52,861
Heads, the answer is yes.

536
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:55,431
Tails...

537
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:08,078
I curse you and every other
no-Good Murphy forever.

538
00:25:22,259 --> 00:25:24,593
- What's a stupid coin
know anyway?

539
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,731
Caitlin, wait!

540
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:30,466
Splorch!

541
00:25:35,139 --> 00:25:37,006
- Unbelievable.

542
00:25:37,008 --> 00:25:38,475
We've suffered generations

543
00:25:38,477 --> 00:25:42,412
Because people
saw her underwear?

544
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:44,814
"I don't want to complain,
but..."

545
00:25:44,816 --> 00:25:46,216
- Ever since that day,

546
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,618
Things haven't been going
so well for me here

547
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,919
In harvest hills.

548
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,891
A man came up to me today,
and he said,

549
00:25:54,893 --> 00:25:58,694
"Tommy Murphy, you are
the unluckiest guy around."

550
00:25:58,696 --> 00:26:00,663
And he was right.

551
00:26:02,132 --> 00:26:04,133
Things that were easy for me

552
00:26:04,135 --> 00:26:06,101
Weren't easy anymore.

553
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:08,070
I tried to find caitlin.

554
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,471
I wanted to talk to her.

555
00:26:09,473 --> 00:26:11,072
- You may kiss the bride.

556
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:13,375
- But I was too late.

557
00:26:17,282 --> 00:26:19,282
- Congratulations.

558
00:26:25,824 --> 00:26:27,523
But I wasn't giving up.

559
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,792
I was gonna find a way
to break the curse.

560
00:26:29,794 --> 00:26:30,993
- Very interesting.

561
00:26:30,995 --> 00:26:31,994
- Even if it killed me.

562
00:26:33,064 --> 00:26:34,130
- Ah!

563
00:26:34,132 --> 00:26:36,365
Which, the way things
were going,

564
00:26:36,367 --> 00:26:37,567
It might.

565
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:47,676
- I finally found the answer.

566
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:48,944
Yes, this is it!

567
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:55,018
"All I have to do to lift
the curse is..."

568
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:58,120
Yes!

569
00:26:59,223 --> 00:27:01,124
Ow!

570
00:27:01,126 --> 00:27:02,192
Ha-Ha.

571
00:27:02,194 --> 00:27:03,360
You stupid curse.

572
00:27:03,362 --> 00:27:06,130
You hit me two seconds
too late.

573
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:10,233
I already know everything
about how to stop you.

574
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:15,304
Caitlin o'leary,
your reign of terror

575
00:27:15,306 --> 00:27:18,340
Has gone on long enough.

576
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:03,093
- Off to an excellent start.

577
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:05,596
Yeah.

578
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:13,237
- There you are.

579
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:16,007
Sweet.

580
00:28:16,009 --> 00:28:17,208
- Hello, sweetheart.

581
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,810
How are you?

582
00:28:18,812 --> 00:28:20,278
Good.

583
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,278
Good talk.

584
00:28:22,515 --> 00:28:24,415
- Every step I take
gets me closer

585
00:28:24,417 --> 00:28:25,783
To my goal of being normal,

586
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,551
Of being just like
everyone else,

587
00:28:27,553 --> 00:28:29,753
Of not being hurricane Meg.

588
00:28:29,755 --> 00:28:31,922
I'm gonna find that coin and...

589
00:28:33,226 --> 00:28:34,492
What now?

590
00:28:34,494 --> 00:28:35,860
- Meg.
Oh, Meg.

591
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:37,428
I've been all over town
looking for you.

592
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:38,730
- What for?

593
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:41,333
- Can't it just be
because I love my sister?

594
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:43,001
All right, I need 50 bucks.

595
00:28:43,003 --> 00:28:45,069
Meg, wait.

596
00:28:45,071 --> 00:28:47,004
There's a skating competition
this summer,

597
00:28:47,006 --> 00:28:48,872
And i'm gonna rock it,
build up my fan base.

598
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:50,374
Get cur-A-Zy.

599
00:28:50,376 --> 00:28:52,176
Only I can't afford
the entrance fee.

600
00:28:52,178 --> 00:28:53,778
- Okay, then why don't you ask
Mom and Dad?

601
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,213
- They said I had
to pay for it myself.

602
00:28:55,215 --> 00:28:56,982
- Okay, then why
are you asking me?

603
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:58,750
- Because I consider you
a patron of the arts.

604
00:29:00,387 --> 00:29:01,453
- Come on, Meg.

605
00:29:01,455 --> 00:29:02,988
Help me give the people
what they want.

606
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:03,989
Loan me the money?

607
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:05,357
- No.

608
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,625
But you can earn it

609
00:29:06,627 --> 00:29:08,026
Helping me break
the Murphy curse.

610
00:29:08,028 --> 00:29:09,461
- Whoa!

611
00:29:09,463 --> 00:29:10,494
Wait, wait, wait.

612
00:29:11,731 --> 00:29:12,864
- Oh, my gosh.

613
00:29:12,866 --> 00:29:14,466
Ivy, i'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

614
00:29:14,468 --> 00:29:15,733
It was...

615
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:17,268
an accident.

616
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,236
- You being born
was an accident.

617
00:29:19,238 --> 00:29:20,838
- If it makes you
feel any better,

618
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:23,007
That was a pretty sweet wipeout.

619
00:29:23,009 --> 00:29:24,675
- Who is this person
speaking to me?

620
00:29:24,677 --> 00:29:26,711
- My brother.

621
00:29:26,713 --> 00:29:28,212
- There are more of you?

622
00:29:28,214 --> 00:29:29,280
Ugh!

623
00:29:29,282 --> 00:29:31,215
Let's go.

624
00:29:32,551 --> 00:29:34,852
- Jeez, what's her problem?

625
00:29:34,854 --> 00:29:38,623
- So much for making friends
in harvest hills.

626
00:29:38,625 --> 00:29:40,124
- Sorry, Meg.

627
00:29:42,895 --> 00:29:44,829
Okay, so let me get
this straight.

628
00:29:44,831 --> 00:29:45,897
You want to break the curse,

629
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:47,365
But you were warned not to,

630
00:29:47,367 --> 00:29:48,633
Which makes me want to help,

631
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:50,468
But how do I get my money?

632
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,208
- "If the curse
you want lifted,

633
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,676
"Find the object
that was flipp-Ed.

634
00:29:57,678 --> 00:29:58,977
"Give it to the next o'leary,

635
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:00,312
But be sure they
take it cheery."

636
00:30:02,548 --> 00:30:03,748
- Yeah, I don't get it.

637
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,250
- It's the key
to breaking the curse.

638
00:30:05,252 --> 00:30:07,752
Great great grandpa tommy
was cursed with a magic coin.

639
00:30:07,754 --> 00:30:08,953
That's what was flipped.

640
00:30:08,955 --> 00:30:10,622
If we give it back
to someone who's related

641
00:30:10,624 --> 00:30:12,123
To that witch woman
caitlin o'leary

642
00:30:12,125 --> 00:30:13,658
Before the end
of the harvest dance,

643
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,959
We can end the curse forever.

644
00:30:14,961 --> 00:30:16,961
We just have to find that coin.

645
00:30:16,963 --> 00:30:18,163
- But, Meg, how are we supposed

646
00:30:18,165 --> 00:30:19,965
To find some coin
from 100 years ago?

647
00:30:19,967 --> 00:30:21,399
It's not like he put an ad
in the paper

648
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:22,667
Saying where he spent it.

649
00:30:22,669 --> 00:30:24,602
- Actually,

650
00:30:24,604 --> 00:30:26,371
He kind of did.

651
00:30:26,373 --> 00:30:28,006
- "Man throws coin in fountain,

652
00:30:28,008 --> 00:30:29,341
Floods town"?

653
00:30:29,343 --> 00:30:30,809
- Tommy threw the coin
in the fountain

654
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:32,077
To try and wish the curse away.

655
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,211
It didn't work,

656
00:30:33,213 --> 00:30:34,879
And the coin caused a crack
in the fountain

657
00:30:34,881 --> 00:30:35,880
That flooded downtown.

658
00:30:35,882 --> 00:30:37,048
Typical Murphy.

659
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,950
- So where's this fountain?

660
00:30:40,953 --> 00:30:42,519
Hey, Meg.

661
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:44,321
I found it.
There it is.

662
00:30:44,323 --> 00:30:46,557
I solved the mystery.

663
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:47,858
- Go.

664
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:53,164
- Which one is it?

665
00:30:53,166 --> 00:30:54,332
- It's a 100-Year-Old coin.

666
00:30:54,334 --> 00:30:56,068
I'm sure it's got to stand out.

667
00:30:59,706 --> 00:31:01,273
- Hey, Meg!

668
00:31:01,275 --> 00:31:02,707
- Brett.
- Quarters, pennies...

669
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:03,707
- um, sorry.

670
00:31:03,709 --> 00:31:06,110
- Whoa!

671
00:31:08,213 --> 00:31:09,613
What the?

672
00:31:15,286 --> 00:31:16,353
- Hey.

673
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:17,988
- It's my favorite boxer.

674
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,490
How does my nose look?
Is it crooked?

675
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:20,691
- Your nose is perfect.

676
00:31:20,693 --> 00:31:21,692
I mean,

677
00:31:21,694 --> 00:31:23,027
Perfectly straight.

678
00:31:23,029 --> 00:31:24,028
I'm sorry.

679
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,262
After what I did,

680
00:31:25,264 --> 00:31:26,863
I thought you'd want
to stay away from me.

681
00:31:26,865 --> 00:31:27,864
I'm a mess.

682
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:28,899
- Are you kidding?

683
00:31:28,901 --> 00:31:30,067
Of course not.

684
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:32,202
You seem like
a really cool mess.

685
00:31:32,204 --> 00:31:34,872
Harvest hills can be
a pretty boring place.

686
00:31:34,874 --> 00:31:37,074
But I feel like hanging out
with you,

687
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:39,309
I wouldn't be bored at all.

688
00:31:39,311 --> 00:31:40,844
Bleeding and terrified, maybe,

689
00:31:40,846 --> 00:31:42,212
But not boring.

690
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,749
Hey!

691
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,983
Hey, come on!

692
00:31:46,985 --> 00:31:49,052
I could use some help here.

693
00:31:49,054 --> 00:31:50,253
There's a lot of coins,

694
00:31:50,255 --> 00:31:52,255
And I only have two hands!

695
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:54,358
- Is that kid trying to take
money out of the fountain?

696
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,593
- Probably just
some crazy person.

697
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:58,829
You were saying something
about hanging out with me?

698
00:32:02,635 --> 00:32:04,235
- As long as you promise
to warn me

699
00:32:04,237 --> 00:32:05,503
If you're gonna punch me again.

700
00:32:05,505 --> 00:32:06,704
- I can't make any promises.

701
00:32:06,706 --> 00:32:08,272
These babies have
a mind of their own.

702
00:32:10,043 --> 00:32:12,577
So I see your reading up
on the town history.

703
00:32:12,579 --> 00:32:13,945
- Oh, this.

704
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:15,546
Yeah, um,

705
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:16,881
Just a big fan of history.

706
00:32:16,883 --> 00:32:17,948
- Oh, me too.

707
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,350
Yeah, I actually used
to volunteer

708
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:20,751
At the town's
historical society.

709
00:32:20,753 --> 00:32:22,119
They have a whole display

710
00:32:22,121 --> 00:32:24,522
On the fountain flood
that destroyed harvest hills.

711
00:32:24,524 --> 00:32:26,490
- And the stupid little coin
that started it.

712
00:32:26,492 --> 00:32:27,792
- Wow.

713
00:32:27,794 --> 00:32:30,327
You really do know the history.

714
00:32:38,135 --> 00:32:40,470
- It's kind of crazy
how a small thing like that

715
00:32:40,472 --> 00:32:42,372
Could cause such a mess.

716
00:32:42,374 --> 00:32:44,074
They have the actual coin
on display there.

717
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:45,442
- They do?

718
00:32:45,444 --> 00:32:47,611
I mean, oh.

719
00:32:47,613 --> 00:32:48,612
That's cool.

720
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,883
Uh-Oh.

721
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,652
So...

722
00:32:56,654 --> 00:32:58,120
i was wondering...

723
00:32:58,122 --> 00:32:59,122
- whoa, whoa, whoa!

724
00:32:59,124 --> 00:33:03,359
If maybe you would, um...

725
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,461
- oh, my gosh.

726
00:33:04,463 --> 00:33:05,996
Is he going to ask me out?

727
00:33:05,998 --> 00:33:07,898
No, don't be ridiculous, Meg.
Why would...

728
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,835
- Do you want to go to the
harvest festival dance with me?

729
00:33:10,837 --> 00:33:12,470
- Sure.

730
00:33:12,472 --> 00:33:13,571
Why not?

731
00:33:13,573 --> 00:33:14,839
- Awesome.

732
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:18,777
- Anyway, um...

733
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:20,212
i should go.

734
00:33:20,214 --> 00:33:22,414
And I will see you later.

735
00:33:22,416 --> 00:33:23,415
- All right.
Bye.

736
00:33:23,417 --> 00:33:25,584
- All right.
Bye.

737
00:33:29,022 --> 00:33:30,489
While you were playing
in the water,

738
00:33:30,491 --> 00:33:32,224
I just solved the mystery
of the coin.

739
00:33:32,226 --> 00:33:34,560
We just have to figure out
how to get it.

740
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:40,065
[Heavy mechanized breathing]

741
00:33:48,541 --> 00:33:51,543
- Okay, let's spread out.

742
00:33:51,545 --> 00:33:52,811
Hi, baby.

743
00:33:52,813 --> 00:33:54,579
Hi, georgie.

744
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:56,882
It's peaches.

745
00:33:58,351 --> 00:34:00,518
- Excuse me, everyone.

746
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,320
I have an announcement to make.

747
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:05,090
I have a date
to the harvest dance.

748
00:34:12,297 --> 00:34:14,332
- Yeah, Meg!

749
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,619
- Hey.

750
00:34:34,621 --> 00:34:36,521
I have a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

751
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:42,027
Ta-Da.

752
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:43,027
It's for the dance.

753
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,163
- It's fireproof,
stain proof, wrinkle proof,

754
00:34:46,165 --> 00:34:47,865
And short enough
you won't trip on it.

755
00:34:47,867 --> 00:34:49,100
- I love it.

756
00:34:49,102 --> 00:34:50,434
Thank you so much.

757
00:34:52,171 --> 00:34:53,704
Let's see.

758
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,374
Oh, honey.

759
00:34:58,376 --> 00:34:59,642
Oh.

760
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,146
You know, the harvest dance

761
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:05,315
Is where your father took me
on our first date.

762
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:08,118
It was the most romantic night
of my whole life.

763
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,520
Even after
your father got sprayed

764
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:12,189
By not one,
but two different skunks.

765
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,026
- I'm so happy.
- Yeah.

766
00:35:16,028 --> 00:35:18,729
Mm, you see?
It's like I always told you.

767
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:20,063
The curse doesn't matter

768
00:35:20,065 --> 00:35:21,865
As long as you have
the right attitude, right?

769
00:35:21,867 --> 00:35:23,033
- Wrong.

770
00:35:23,035 --> 00:35:24,368
I was happy because i
was a day away

771
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:26,003
From breaking the curse.

772
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:27,004
Right.

773
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:28,472
- Hmm.

774
00:35:34,747 --> 00:35:37,648
- Well, I think we can agree,

775
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,650
It's time for this
a-Cha-Ching-Cha-Ching.

776
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:40,952
- And what does that mean?

777
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:42,153
- Money?

778
00:35:42,155 --> 00:35:43,355
I mean, you got to pay up.

779
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:44,723
I helped you look for the coin.

780
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:45,991
- Yeah, right.

781
00:35:45,993 --> 00:35:47,693
You don't get paid
until we break the curse.

782
00:35:47,695 --> 00:35:48,894
And we still don't have the coin

783
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:50,463
Or know who
caitlin's descendants are.

784
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:52,765
You have earned zero dollars.

785
00:35:52,767 --> 00:35:54,133
- Aw, jeez.

786
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:55,968
You know, you're going
through a lot of trouble

787
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,069
Just for some boy.

788
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:58,371
- I'm not doing this
for some boy.

789
00:35:58,373 --> 00:36:00,106
I'm doing this for us,
for our family,

790
00:36:00,108 --> 00:36:02,641
So our lives can finally
be normal.

791
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:05,044
- Meg...

792
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,779
i don't know if I want
my life to be normal.

793
00:36:06,781 --> 00:36:08,013
- What are you talking about?

794
00:36:08,015 --> 00:36:09,481
- It's just,

795
00:36:09,483 --> 00:36:10,716
What about my skating?

796
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,651
If we break the curse, then...

797
00:36:12,653 --> 00:36:14,787
i won't be a master
of destruction anymore.

798
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:16,989
Don't worry, buddy.

799
00:36:16,991 --> 00:36:18,224
Even without the curse,

800
00:36:18,226 --> 00:36:21,060
You're probably still
a terrible skater.

801
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:22,061
- Thanks, Meg.

802
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:23,529
- The dance is tomorrow,

803
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:25,831
So we're breaking into that
historical building tonight.

804
00:36:25,833 --> 00:36:27,233
And we need to get a coin

805
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:29,068
And find out who's related
to caitlin o'leary.

806
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:30,069
- All right.

807
00:36:30,071 --> 00:36:31,070
Heist time!

808
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:33,173
- Shh.

809
00:36:33,175 --> 00:36:35,876
Heist time.

810
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,711
- What?

811
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,913
It's the only black clothes
i own.

812
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:58,781
- Okay, but why bring the wand?

813
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:08,457
All of harvest hills'
historical treasure

814
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,092
Is guarded
by impenetrable security,

815
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:11,260
But I have a plan.

816
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,394
We'll get in from above

817
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:13,695
Through the skylight.

818
00:37:13,697 --> 00:37:14,930
You will repel to the roof,

819
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,831
Then through the skylight
with glass cutters.

820
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:20,035
I'll create a distraction here
to mask the noise.

821
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:21,503
Here's where it gets
a little tricky.

822
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,971
You've seen spiderman, right?

823
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:25,640
Take these suction cups and...

824
00:37:25,642 --> 00:37:28,476
- hey, sweet.
It's unlocked.

825
00:37:28,478 --> 00:37:29,978
- Can do it that way.

826
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,351
Come on.

827
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,021
- Don't make any sound,

828
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,456
And don't touch anything.

829
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:43,625
- Like there's anything
in here i'd want to touch.

830
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:50,899
Hey, check it out.

831
00:37:50,901 --> 00:37:52,133
She's picking my nose.

832
00:37:52,135 --> 00:37:53,869
- Stop messing around.

833
00:38:00,676 --> 00:38:02,377
I have no idea
what you're saying.

834
00:38:02,379 --> 00:38:03,879
- I'm gonna go look over there.

835
00:38:03,881 --> 00:38:05,547
- Fine. You go look
for the coin.

836
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:07,782
I'm gonna try and find
the town records.

837
00:38:26,069 --> 00:38:27,970
- Uh!

838
00:38:46,256 --> 00:38:48,023
Whoa.

839
00:39:00,136 --> 00:39:01,670
Ha-Ha.

840
00:39:14,214 --> 00:39:15,581
Meg, I got it.
I found the coin.

841
00:39:15,583 --> 00:39:16,849
- Nice.

842
00:39:16,851 --> 00:39:18,116
- Aw, yeah.

843
00:39:18,118 --> 00:39:20,418
I saw the target,
and I acquired it.

844
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,419
I slipped in and out
of the shadows silent

845
00:39:22,421 --> 00:39:23,720
And undetected.

846
00:39:23,722 --> 00:39:24,854
Yep.

847
00:39:24,856 --> 00:39:26,756
I'm pretty much a ninja.

848
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:30,959
- Shh.

849
00:39:32,195 --> 00:39:33,894
Quick.
Hide.

850
00:40:24,699 --> 00:40:26,400
- Hmm.

851
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:43,145
Man, that was so close.

852
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,179
- Okay.

853
00:40:44,181 --> 00:40:45,880
I figured it out.

854
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:50,717
If caitlin o'leary had a baby,

855
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:51,951
And that baby had a baby,

856
00:40:51,953 --> 00:40:54,019
And on and on
for five generations,

857
00:40:54,021 --> 00:40:56,921
Then this book shows everyone
who's related to them.

858
00:40:56,923 --> 00:40:59,190
It goes all the way down
to present day.

859
00:40:59,192 --> 00:41:00,858
So according to this,

860
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,893
The most recent descendent
of caitlin o'leary

861
00:41:02,895 --> 00:41:07,530
And the person we have
to give the coin to is...

862
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,832
oh.

863
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,233
- Well, who is it?

864
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:17,804
- Ivy.

865
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:19,172
I should have guessed.

866
00:41:19,174 --> 00:41:20,839
The girl who dubbed me
hurricane Meg

867
00:41:20,841 --> 00:41:22,407
Is the descendent of the woman

868
00:41:22,409 --> 00:41:25,376
Who caused the hurricane
in the first place.

869
00:41:25,378 --> 00:41:26,544
- Target acquired.

870
00:41:26,546 --> 00:41:29,213
- I'm gonna get into position.

871
00:41:30,381 --> 00:41:32,081
♪ All the lights,
turn them off ♪

872
00:41:32,083 --> 00:41:33,682

876
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:45,357
- As I watched ivy,
i couldn't help thinking,

877
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:46,992
What if this curse
somehow sensed

878
00:41:46,994 --> 00:41:48,493
I was about to break it?

879
00:41:48,495 --> 00:41:50,428
It would do anything it could
to stop me.

880
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:52,096
I would have to be more careful
than ever

881
00:41:52,098 --> 00:41:53,664
If I wanted
to survive long enough to...

882
00:41:53,666 --> 00:41:54,732
- Hey, Meg.

883
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:56,033
Hey, Meg, does this thing work?

884
00:41:56,035 --> 00:41:57,634
- Stop interrupting
my inner monologue.

885
00:41:57,636 --> 00:41:58,635
Yes, it works, charlie.

886
00:41:58,637 --> 00:41:59,669
You don't have to scream.

887
00:41:59,671 --> 00:42:00,903
Where are you?

888
00:42:00,905 --> 00:42:02,204
- Tonight my name is nighthawk,

889
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:03,304
And i'm up in the lights.

890
00:42:03,306 --> 00:42:04,738
I'm a go.

891
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:06,073
- I'm not calling you
nighthawk.

892
00:42:06,075 --> 00:42:07,775
- Please?
Please, please, please?

893
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:08,775
- Oh, my god, okay, fine.

894
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,109
- What's fine?

895
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:12,278
- Uh, you.

896
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,512
You're looking...

897
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:15,613
fine.

898
00:42:16,882 --> 00:42:18,348
- Ha, shut up.

899
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:21,117
I mean, wow.
I should shut up.

900
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:24,119
I mean, hi.

901
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:26,654
- Uh, hi to you too.

902
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:28,522
You look really pretty tonight.

903
00:42:28,524 --> 00:42:30,090
Do you want
to go get some punch?

904
00:42:30,092 --> 00:42:32,191
- No,
me and punch are a bad idea,

905
00:42:32,193 --> 00:42:33,725
With the spilling and whatnot.

906
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:34,825
- Get your raffle tickets.

907
00:42:34,827 --> 00:42:36,026
What about you, young lady?

908
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:37,027
- Oh, no, thank you.

909
00:42:37,029 --> 00:42:38,628
- You could win
an all-Expense-Paid trip

910
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:39,629
To the grand canyon.

911
00:42:39,631 --> 00:42:40,630
- Trust me.
I won't win.

912
00:42:40,632 --> 00:42:42,865
Not in 100 years.
0% chance.

913
00:42:42,867 --> 00:42:44,133
- Here you go.

914
00:42:44,135 --> 00:42:45,434
- What's the name
for the ticket?

915
00:42:45,436 --> 00:42:46,802
- Meg Murphy.

916
00:42:49,371 --> 00:42:51,806
Thanks.

917
00:42:51,808 --> 00:42:54,574
So I present to you as a
"thank you" for being my date

918
00:42:54,576 --> 00:42:57,910
A 0% chance
of winning a vacation.

919
00:42:57,912 --> 00:42:59,678
Or maybe tonight
your luck will change.

920
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,279
- Thank you.
And I hope so.

921
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,381
- Oh, and it's also
your lucky day

922
00:43:03,383 --> 00:43:05,616
Because you get to embarrass
yourself on the dance floor

923
00:43:05,618 --> 00:43:06,950
With me right now.

924
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,151
But I have to warn you.

925
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,953
I got moves.

926
00:43:09,955 --> 00:43:11,021
It's the lawnmower.

927
00:43:11,023 --> 00:43:12,489
What?
It's the running man.

928
00:43:12,491 --> 00:43:13,523
I'm a sprinkler.

929
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:14,724
- Stop, stop, I can't take it.

930
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:15,825
You're too good.

931
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:19,095
Shall we?

932
00:43:19,097 --> 00:43:20,363
- Yes.

933
00:43:20,365 --> 00:43:21,598
- Remember the mission.

934
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,233
Target's
in the refreshment area.

935
00:43:23,235 --> 00:43:25,368
- I mean, no.

936
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,636
I mean,
i have to go get something.

937
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:28,938
I'll be right back.

938
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,373
- Okay.

939
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,141
- Nighthawk, cover me.
I'm going in.

940
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,277
- Hey, Meg, I was thinking
about the rhyme of the curse.

941
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:35,812
You know, "give it
to the next o'leary,

942
00:43:35,814 --> 00:43:37,080
Make sure they take it cheery."

943
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:39,048
You know, I was thinking
you could tell her a joke,

944
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:40,049
Like, "knock-Knock."

945
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,050
"Who's there?"

946
00:43:41,052 --> 00:43:42,051
"Give me the coin."

947
00:43:42,053 --> 00:43:43,052
"Give me the coin who?"

948
00:43:43,054 --> 00:43:44,254
And then give her the coin.

949
00:43:44,256 --> 00:43:46,289
- Yeah, no.
I think i'll just wing it.

950
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:47,556
Ah!

952
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:52,995
Meg Murphy!

953
00:43:52,997 --> 00:43:55,031
- I am so sorry.

954
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:57,367
- This night was supposed
to be special.

955
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,769
You will never stop
tormenting me.

956
00:43:59,771 --> 00:44:01,371
- Tormenting you?

957
00:44:01,373 --> 00:44:02,940
You're mean to me for fun.

958
00:44:02,942 --> 00:44:04,074
- Are you insane?

959
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:05,643
You're the mean one,
Meg Murphy.

960
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:07,678
You've been ruining my life
every single day

961
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,214
For the past eight years!

962
00:44:10,216 --> 00:44:12,149
My last name is murray.

963
00:44:12,151 --> 00:44:13,583
Murray,
Murphy...

964
00:44:13,585 --> 00:44:14,584
It's alphabetical.

965
00:44:14,586 --> 00:44:17,153
Splorch!

966
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,655
Every year, every class,

967
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:21,023
I have been one seat over
from you.

968
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:22,558
Everything that happened to you

969
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,559
Happened to me.

970
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:26,028
Oh!

971
00:44:26,030 --> 00:44:27,931
You've made every day
of my life

972
00:44:27,933 --> 00:44:28,999
A living nightmare.

973
00:44:29,001 --> 00:44:31,301
Ah!

974
00:44:33,071 --> 00:44:34,405
And the saddest part

975
00:44:34,407 --> 00:44:36,240
Is that you've always been
so full of yourself

976
00:44:36,242 --> 00:44:38,843
And your whole,
"i'm cursed, so pity me" saga,

977
00:44:38,845 --> 00:44:40,878
That you've never even noticed
anyone around you.

978
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:42,413
- Could what she
was saying be true?

979
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:44,014
Do I just ignore
the people around me?

980
00:44:44,016 --> 00:44:45,216
- Are you even listening to me?

981
00:44:45,218 --> 00:44:46,751
- Hey, ivy, cut it out!

982
00:44:46,753 --> 00:44:48,452
You're the one feeling sorry
for yourself.

983
00:44:48,454 --> 00:44:50,087
- What?

984
00:44:50,089 --> 00:44:52,256
- Yeah, you've been moping
around this town all summer.

985
00:44:52,258 --> 00:44:55,159
- It's not Meg's fault
she's a little accident-Prone.

986
00:44:55,161 --> 00:44:56,727
- Accident-Prone my foot.

987
00:44:56,729 --> 00:44:57,728
She's cursed.

988
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:58,729
- Oh, come on.

989
00:44:58,731 --> 00:45:00,064
- It's true.

990
00:45:00,066 --> 00:45:01,932
I am cursed.

991
00:45:01,934 --> 00:45:04,468
All the bad stuff
that happens to me,

992
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:05,936
It's...

993
00:45:05,938 --> 00:45:08,672
it's never gonna go away, so...

994
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:09,873
that's that.

995
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:12,042
- Come on, who cares what
my cousin thinks?

996
00:45:12,044 --> 00:45:14,111
I like you.

997
00:45:15,147 --> 00:45:16,213
Come on.

998
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:17,314
- Seriously?

999
00:45:18,851 --> 00:45:20,318
- Wait. You and ivy
are related?

1000
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,853
- That's what cousins means.

1001
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:23,121
- So caitlin o'leary was...

1002
00:45:23,123 --> 00:45:24,822
- my great great grandmother?

1003
00:45:24,824 --> 00:45:27,925
Kind of weird that you know
that, by the way.

1004
00:45:27,927 --> 00:45:30,061
- Hey, Meg, that means
you can still break the curse.

1005
00:45:30,063 --> 00:45:31,562
You just have to give brett
the coin.

1006
00:45:31,564 --> 00:45:32,930
- This is it, guys.

1007
00:45:32,932 --> 00:45:34,599
End of the dance.

1008
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:36,034
So let's finish up the evening

1009
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:40,238
With the traditional
harvest hills square dance.

1010
00:45:41,241 --> 00:45:42,640
- May i?

1011
00:45:42,642 --> 00:45:44,542
- Oh, just give him the coin.
It's the last dance.

1012
00:45:44,544 --> 00:45:46,944
- Okay.
- Come on, let's dance.

1013
00:45:49,115 --> 00:45:50,981
- Uh-Oh.
Big problem.

1014
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:53,717
- I'm nighthawk.

1015
00:45:56,722 --> 00:46:00,558
?

1016
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:06,963
?

1017
00:46:22,581 --> 00:46:23,614
All: whoo!

1018
00:46:23,616 --> 00:46:24,849
Whoo!

1019
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:27,351
- I need to talk
to you in private.

1020
00:46:27,353 --> 00:46:28,585
- What is it?

1021
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:29,653
- Uh...

1022
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:30,654
knock-Knock.

1023
00:46:30,656 --> 00:46:31,855
- Excuse me?
- Coming through.

1024
00:46:31,857 --> 00:46:32,956
- Knock-Knock.

1025
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:34,291
- Who's there?
- Give me that coin.

1026
00:46:34,293 --> 00:46:35,292
- Give me that coin who?

1027
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:36,293
- Thank you.

1028
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:38,462
- Okay.

1029
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:39,864
Well, thanks.

1030
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:42,433
I'll keep it as a memento.

1031
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:54,178
- What a fantastic last dance,
ladies and gentlemen.

1032
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,379
Thank you.

1033
00:46:55,381 --> 00:46:56,447
- Nighthawk here.

1034
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:59,550
Did you break the curse?

1035
00:46:59,552 --> 00:47:00,851
- Was it broken?

1036
00:47:00,853 --> 00:47:02,520
I didn't know.
How could I tell?

1037
00:47:02,522 --> 00:47:04,789
- And now what you've all
been waiting for.

1038
00:47:04,791 --> 00:47:07,392
I'd like to congratulate
the lucky winner

1039
00:47:07,394 --> 00:47:08,727
Of our raffle,

1040
00:47:08,729 --> 00:47:09,728
Meg Murphy!

1041
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:12,231
- Meg.

1042
00:47:12,233 --> 00:47:13,231
Meg, you won.

1043
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,600
- No, I never win anything.

1044
00:47:14,602 --> 00:47:17,669
- Meg Murphy, please come up
here and claim your prize.

1045
00:47:17,671 --> 00:47:18,837
- I won.
- You won.

1046
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,138
- I won.
- I told you.

1047
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:21,940
Ms. 0% chance.

1048
00:47:21,942 --> 00:47:23,875
- Hey, kid if you play
your cards right,

1049
00:47:23,877 --> 00:47:25,310
Maybe your girlfriend here

1050
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:27,079
Will bring you on her vacation.

1051
00:47:27,081 --> 00:47:28,513
- Yeah.

1052
00:47:28,515 --> 00:47:30,048
Maybe my girlfriend will.

1053
00:47:30,050 --> 00:47:31,416
- Girlfriend?

1054
00:47:42,528 --> 00:47:43,595
The curse is broken.

1055
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:45,663
My life is finally
gonna be normal.

1056
00:47:45,665 --> 00:47:47,298
I can do anything I want.

1057
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,601
I even, amazingly,
unbelievably,

1058
00:47:49,603 --> 00:47:51,836
Stupendously have a boyfriend.

1059
00:47:51,838 --> 00:47:54,705
Life is perfect.

1060
00:47:56,575 --> 00:47:58,609
- "By harvest night
complete this verse,

1061
00:47:58,611 --> 00:48:02,312
And the o'learys
will receive the curse"?

1062
00:48:02,314 --> 00:48:04,114
What is this?

1063
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:31,648
♪ It's a brand-New day ♪

1064
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:33,150
♪ and everything is okay ♪

1065
00:48:33,152 --> 00:48:35,419
♪ I don't have the curse ♪

1066
00:48:35,421 --> 00:48:39,122
♪ something that rhymes
with curse ♪

1067
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,691
All right,
this isn't a musical,

1068
00:48:40,693 --> 00:48:42,726
And I can't sing,
but the point is,

1069
00:48:42,728 --> 00:48:44,828
I'm curse-Free.

1070
00:48:52,670 --> 00:48:53,770
Look out, world.

1071
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:55,205
There's so much I can do now.

1072
00:48:55,207 --> 00:48:57,774
No more hurricane Meg.

1073
00:49:00,212 --> 00:49:02,379
- Okay, mr. Cookie,

1074
00:49:02,381 --> 00:49:04,714
Give me your worst.

1075
00:49:08,753 --> 00:49:10,086
Ding!

1076
00:49:14,958 --> 00:49:18,827
What the heck?

1077
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:20,796
Both: something's wrong.

1078
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:23,900
- The insta cookie's
working perfectly.

1079
00:49:23,902 --> 00:49:25,835
- I fed the baby,
and look at me.

1080
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,337
I'm clean.

1081
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,207
- If I didn't know any better,
i...

1082
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:31,775
- oh, no.

1083
00:49:31,777 --> 00:49:32,776
Oh, she couldn't.

1084
00:49:32,778 --> 00:49:33,944
- No.

1085
00:49:33,946 --> 00:49:34,945
She wouldn't.

1086
00:49:34,947 --> 00:49:36,680
- No.

1087
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,782
Meg!

1088
00:49:38,784 --> 00:49:39,883
Meg?

1089
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:43,821
- I have some amazing news,
everyone.

1090
00:49:43,823 --> 00:49:45,856
- Meg, did you break the curse?

1091
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:47,791
- Yes!
Whoo-Hoo!

1092
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,128
- Why is no one jumping up
and down?

1093
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,030
- Meg, honey,
what were you thinking?

1094
00:49:53,032 --> 00:49:55,166
- I was thinking i'd get rid
of that horrible curse

1095
00:49:55,168 --> 00:49:56,701
That's been in our family.

1096
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:58,436
You know,
the one that makes us trip,

1097
00:49:58,438 --> 00:49:59,604
Throws tree branches at us,

1098
00:49:59,606 --> 00:50:02,073
And makes houses fall down
and stuff.

1099
00:50:02,075 --> 00:50:03,240
Aren't you happy?

1100
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:05,510
- Honey, um,
who did you give the coin to?

1101
00:50:05,512 --> 00:50:07,378
- Brett,
and it ended the curse.

1102
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,414
- No, Meg.

1103
00:50:09,416 --> 00:50:11,816
You didn't end the curse.

1104
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:14,419
You transferred it
to... To brett and his family.

1105
00:50:14,421 --> 00:50:16,387
- And now he's doomed.

1106
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,622
It all makes sense now.

1107
00:50:17,624 --> 00:50:19,057
- What are you talking about?

1108
00:50:19,059 --> 00:50:20,658
- It's the last verse
of the rhyme

1109
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:22,427
From tommy's diary.

1110
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:25,697
"By harvest night,
complete this verse..."

1111
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:28,333
All: "and the o'learys
shall receive the curse."

1112
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,417
- This line has been
temporarily disconnected.

1113
00:50:46,419 --> 00:50:47,685
- Never a good sign.

1114
00:50:47,687 --> 00:50:49,587
This has to be some sort
of horrible mistake.

1115
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:51,489
Seriously, brett was fine.

1116
00:50:51,491 --> 00:50:52,523
I think.

1117
00:50:52,525 --> 00:50:53,691
I mean, I could never...

1118
00:50:53,693 --> 00:50:57,194
I would never transfer
the curse to him.

1119
00:50:57,196 --> 00:50:58,495
I was just trying
to get rid of it.

1120
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:02,534
Hey, is there any way I can
transfer the curse back to us?

1121
00:51:02,536 --> 00:51:03,902
- I'm afraid not.

1122
00:51:03,904 --> 00:51:06,238
The curse can only be broken
during the harvest dance.

1123
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:07,706
- I don't believe this.

1124
00:51:07,708 --> 00:51:09,074
I'm gonna kill my boyfriend

1125
00:51:09,076 --> 00:51:10,843
Before I get my first kiss.

1126
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,279
- I got this, honey.

1127
00:51:15,281 --> 00:51:17,014
- Uh, yeah, i'll go.

1128
00:51:17,016 --> 00:51:19,383
- I was hoping you
were gonna say that.

1129
00:51:19,385 --> 00:51:22,018
- Now that i'm normal,
i'm supposed to be happy.

1130
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:25,822
But instead i'm more miserable
than ever.

1131
00:51:25,824 --> 00:51:27,891
- Honey, i... I don't know
why you thought

1132
00:51:27,893 --> 00:51:30,261
You needed to be normal
to be happy in the first place.

1133
00:51:30,263 --> 00:51:33,498
- Because how can anyone be
happy when they're jinxed?

1134
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:36,467
- You know,
i wasn't born a Murphy.

1135
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:40,004
For 20 years, I lived
a perfectly normal life.

1136
00:51:41,372 --> 00:51:43,373
And I will tell you a secret.

1137
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:47,344
Since I married your father
and I took this curse on,

1138
00:51:47,346 --> 00:51:49,513
I have never been happier.

1139
00:51:50,782 --> 00:51:52,616
Oh, sweetie.

1140
00:51:52,618 --> 00:51:54,919
I told you before,
this curse does not determine

1141
00:51:54,921 --> 00:51:58,222
Whether or not your life
is good or bad or happy

1142
00:51:58,224 --> 00:51:59,657
Or lonely.

1143
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,626
You do.

1144
00:52:01,628 --> 00:52:03,128
- But it's too late.

1145
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:05,697
I've already given
the curse to brett.

1146
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:08,132
It's over.

1147
00:52:08,134 --> 00:52:09,233
- No, it's not over.

1148
00:52:09,235 --> 00:52:10,502
- What?
How?

1149
00:52:10,504 --> 00:52:12,170
- I took a second look
at the diary.

1150
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:14,739
The curse must be broken
by the end of the festival,

1151
00:52:14,741 --> 00:52:15,907
Not the dance.

1152
00:52:15,909 --> 00:52:17,976
The festival...
Back then,

1153
00:52:17,978 --> 00:52:20,512
The dance
was the very last event.

1154
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:21,981
- But it isn't anymore.

1155
00:52:21,983 --> 00:52:24,251
The festival doesn't end
until the closing ceremonies.

1156
00:52:24,253 --> 00:52:26,453
- So that means I can still take
the curse back from brett.

1157
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:27,688
- Yeah.
- I'm going to his house.

1158
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:29,222
- Quick, you only have an hour.

1159
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:30,257
Run!

1160
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:31,958
- Run!

1161
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,960
Okay, we've got
an hour without the curse.

1162
00:52:35,364 --> 00:52:37,430
I haven't used a curling iron
since I became a Murphy.

1163
00:52:39,201 --> 00:52:41,167
- One hour with no curse.

1164
00:52:41,169 --> 00:52:42,736
- Dad...

1165
00:52:42,738 --> 00:52:44,404
Is it cool if I use this

1166
00:52:44,406 --> 00:52:45,672
To chop down one of your trees?

1167
00:52:45,674 --> 00:52:46,673
- Sure, son.

1168
00:52:46,675 --> 00:52:47,708
- Hoo-Hoo-Hoo-Hoo!

1169
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:51,078
No curse!

1170
00:52:51,080 --> 00:52:52,380
- I can run!

1171
00:52:52,382 --> 00:52:55,116
Without tripping or...
Or hitting tree branches.

1172
00:52:55,118 --> 00:52:57,051
So this
is what normal feels like.

1173
00:52:57,053 --> 00:52:59,020
No worries, no fear
of everyday things

1174
00:52:59,022 --> 00:53:01,222
Like waking up in the morning
with a bat in your hair

1175
00:53:01,224 --> 00:53:03,625
Or... Or walking or...

1176
00:53:03,627 --> 00:53:05,927
wait.

1177
00:53:05,929 --> 00:53:07,595
If I take the curse back,

1178
00:53:07,597 --> 00:53:09,163
Good-Bye running,

1179
00:53:09,165 --> 00:53:11,665
Good-Bye science camp,
good-Bye normal.

1180
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,800
Taking the curse back
means giving up everything

1181
00:53:13,802 --> 00:53:14,968
I've been hoping for.

1182
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,330
Whoosh!

1183
00:53:59,845 --> 00:54:01,246
Um...

1184
00:54:02,249 --> 00:54:03,949
Hello?

1185
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,590
- You.

1186
00:54:10,592 --> 00:54:12,859
- What are you doing here?

1187
00:54:12,861 --> 00:54:14,827
- Not that it's any
of your business,

1188
00:54:14,829 --> 00:54:16,529
But my house fell down today.

1189
00:54:16,531 --> 00:54:17,997
Then I come
to my cousin's house,

1190
00:54:17,999 --> 00:54:20,166
And there's an angry monkey
tearing the place apart.

1191
00:54:20,168 --> 00:54:21,367
Now you show up,

1192
00:54:21,369 --> 00:54:23,869
And this is officially
the worst day ever.

1193
00:54:23,871 --> 00:54:25,204
- I know.

1194
00:54:25,206 --> 00:54:27,941
And i'm sorry,
but I need to find brett.

1195
00:54:27,943 --> 00:54:29,343
- He's at the closing ceremony.

1196
00:54:29,345 --> 00:54:30,344
Now bye!

1197
00:54:30,346 --> 00:54:32,413
- Ivy, here's the thing.

1198
00:54:32,415 --> 00:54:35,583
There's a chance that I maybe
might have possibly,

1199
00:54:35,585 --> 00:54:39,386
Accidentally cursed you
and your entire family.

1200
00:54:39,388 --> 00:54:40,387
- You think?

1201
00:54:40,389 --> 00:54:41,888
- Right, sorry.

1202
00:54:41,890 --> 00:54:44,024
But I need your help to...

1203
00:54:44,026 --> 00:54:46,393
how did you get all that gum
in your hair?

1204
00:54:46,395 --> 00:54:48,428
- The angry monkey.

1205
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,030
I don't want to talk about it.

1206
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:51,631
- Right.

1207
00:54:51,633 --> 00:54:53,300
I have to find brett
to take the curse back

1208
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:54,568
Before the festival ends,

1209
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:56,270
Or you and your family
will be stuck with it.

1210
00:54:56,272 --> 00:54:58,039
We need to go.

1211
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,207
Ivy didn't want to go at first,

1212
00:55:00,209 --> 00:55:01,942
Even though after one day
with the curse,

1213
00:55:01,944 --> 00:55:03,911
She lost her house,
she has gum in her hair,

1214
00:55:03,913 --> 00:55:06,313
And her cousin's house
is a wreck.

1215
00:55:06,315 --> 00:55:08,215
It was the thought
of being alone with the monkey

1216
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:09,283
That convinced her to help.

1217
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:15,074
- Next contestant
in the harvest hills skate jam,

1218
00:55:15,076 --> 00:55:16,309
Charlie Murphy.

1219
00:55:16,311 --> 00:55:18,912
- Yo, I bet he breaks
every bone in his body.

1220
00:55:18,914 --> 00:55:20,446
How awesome is this gonna be?

1221
00:55:20,448 --> 00:55:22,282
- Hey, skater fail boy.

1222
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:24,784
How do you plan out
those gnarly crunches?

1223
00:55:24,786 --> 00:55:26,753
- Eh, it's a gift.

1224
00:55:26,755 --> 00:55:28,121
I don't even have to try.

1225
00:55:35,263 --> 00:55:38,098
- Charlie.

1226
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,433
What's the matter?

1227
00:55:39,435 --> 00:55:42,203
- I'm not cursed,
so i'm not gonna fail,

1228
00:55:42,205 --> 00:55:43,604
And then everyone's
gonna hate me.

1229
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,573
They're not gonna hate you.

1230
00:55:46,575 --> 00:55:48,208
Just do your best.

1231
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,677
- Dad, i'm skater fail boy.

1232
00:55:50,679 --> 00:55:51,912
- No.

1233
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:53,747
You're charlie Murphy.

1234
00:55:53,749 --> 00:55:56,349
And cursed or not,

1235
00:55:56,351 --> 00:55:58,318
You can do anything.

1236
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,186
If you try.

1237
00:56:01,188 --> 00:56:02,688
- Thanks, Dad.

1238
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:04,757
- Go get 'em, son.

1239
00:56:28,948 --> 00:56:30,181
- Whoa!

1240
00:56:34,254 --> 00:56:35,887
Yeah.

1241
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:44,595
I did it.

1242
00:56:44,597 --> 00:56:45,997
- Whoo-Hoo!

1243
00:56:45,999 --> 00:56:47,531
Way to go, charlie!

1244
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:48,632
Yeah!

1245
00:56:48,634 --> 00:56:49,866
- Yeah, I did it!

1246
00:56:49,868 --> 00:56:51,768
Yeah!

1247
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:52,769
- Whoo!

1248
00:56:52,771 --> 00:56:53,836
That's my son.

1249
00:56:53,838 --> 00:56:55,104
Whoo!

1250
00:57:00,178 --> 00:57:02,745
- Yeah, I did it!

1251
00:57:02,747 --> 00:57:04,614
I did it!

1252
00:57:04,616 --> 00:57:06,916
Yeah, I did it!

1253
00:57:13,123 --> 00:57:15,725
- Where is this kid?

1254
00:57:16,827 --> 00:57:18,094
- Whoa!

1255
00:57:21,031 --> 00:57:22,331
- I'm sorry i'm late, sir.

1256
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,000
It's been kind of a crazy day.

1257
00:57:24,002 --> 00:57:26,569
I had to outrun
a bitey raccoon.

1258
00:57:26,571 --> 00:57:27,570
But I think I lost him.

1259
00:57:27,572 --> 00:57:30,139
- Um, okay.

1260
00:57:30,141 --> 00:57:31,908
Let's all give a big hand
to brett taylor

1261
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,244
For being chosen as this year's
closing ceremony ambassador.

1262
00:57:38,684 --> 00:57:42,686
Thanks to his tireless community
service for our great town.

1263
00:57:42,688 --> 00:57:45,455
Now, once he climbs up there
and lowers the festival flag,

1264
00:57:45,457 --> 00:57:48,557
Another festival of fun
will officially end.

1265
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:50,192
Okay, son.

1266
00:57:50,194 --> 00:57:52,227
Climb that tower.

1267
00:58:11,782 --> 00:58:13,082
- Wait.

1268
00:58:14,318 --> 00:58:15,451
I need a break.

1269
00:58:15,453 --> 00:58:16,953
Ah!

1270
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:17,954
- Ivy.

1271
00:58:19,091 --> 00:58:20,657
- Are you okay?

1272
00:58:31,003 --> 00:58:32,569
This whole time I thought
you were doing

1273
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:34,537
These awful things
to me on purpose.

1274
00:58:34,539 --> 00:58:38,509
I thought you were out
to get me.

1275
00:58:38,511 --> 00:58:39,810
You weren't, were you?

1276
00:58:45,184 --> 00:58:47,818
I've been unfair to you.

1277
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:49,621
You really were cursed.

1278
00:58:49,623 --> 00:58:53,359
- It's okay.

1279
00:58:53,361 --> 00:58:54,660
I should have been nicer
as well.

1280
00:58:54,662 --> 00:58:56,729
I mean, I never really realized

1281
00:58:56,731 --> 00:59:00,499
How much my hurricane can get
other people caught in it.

1282
00:59:00,501 --> 00:59:01,700
If it makes you feel any better,

1283
00:59:01,702 --> 00:59:03,069
I've fallen
in enough mud puddles

1284
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:04,738
To know it does wonders
for your skin.

1285
00:59:06,842 --> 00:59:08,108
- Now, come on.

1286
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,343
Let's go find brett.

1287
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,255
- Really?

1288
00:59:21,257 --> 00:59:22,789
Go.

1289
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:25,692
Whoa!

1290
00:59:40,175 --> 00:59:42,142
- I don't see him.

1291
00:59:46,514 --> 00:59:47,581
- There he is!

1292
01:00:02,764 --> 01:00:04,831
- All right, go get him, Meg.

1293
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:08,500
All: climb over three feet,
you're dead meat.

1294
01:00:08,502 --> 01:00:11,170
- Listen to us, dummy!

1295
01:00:11,172 --> 01:00:13,573
- Meg?

1296
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,509
Do you want me
to climb up there instead?

1297
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:18,511
- No, just stay right there

1298
01:00:18,513 --> 01:00:20,914
And don't look up until I take
the curse back from brett,

1299
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:22,783
Or a meteor might fall
from the sky

1300
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:25,252
Or something if you do.

1301
01:00:25,254 --> 01:00:26,253
Okay.

1302
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:27,855
Not this time, ladder.

1303
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:28,956
Not this time.

1304
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,024
I won't let my fear of...

1305
01:00:30,026 --> 01:00:31,158
- Are you gonna go already?

1306
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,894
- Right.

1307
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:35,163
Okay.

1308
01:00:55,853 --> 01:00:57,420
- This was it.

1309
01:00:57,422 --> 01:01:01,057
My last chance to back out
and have my life be normal.

1310
01:01:01,059 --> 01:01:05,362
But then I realized something.

1311
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:07,064
I don't want to be normal.

1312
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:10,201
I want to be me,
hurricane Meg, a Murphy.

1313
01:01:10,203 --> 01:01:11,402
And cursed or not,

1314
01:01:11,404 --> 01:01:13,138
If I can climb a ladder,

1315
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,706
I can do anything.

1316
01:01:19,812 --> 01:01:21,946
Stop!
Don't lower the flag!

1317
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:24,582
- Meg?

1318
01:01:24,584 --> 01:01:26,417
- You're the first good thing
i've seen all day.

1319
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:27,518
It's been kind of crazy.

1320
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,220
- I know,
and it's all my fault.

1321
01:01:29,222 --> 01:01:30,655
I gave you a curse.

1322
01:01:30,657 --> 01:01:32,023
- What?

1323
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,258
- You see, my family was cursed
with bad luck by a witch,

1324
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:36,727
And then I sort of gave it
to you.

1325
01:01:36,729 --> 01:01:38,229
I'm sorry.

1326
01:01:38,231 --> 01:01:40,698
- What... So this happens
to you every day?

1327
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:42,534
- On a good day, yeah.

1328
01:01:42,536 --> 01:01:44,602
That coin I gave you last night,
do you still have it?

1329
01:01:44,604 --> 01:01:45,804
- Uh, yeah, I kept it,

1330
01:01:45,806 --> 01:01:46,871
I thought for good luck.

1331
01:01:46,873 --> 01:01:47,872
- Great.

1332
01:01:47,874 --> 01:01:48,940
I can take the curse back.

1333
01:01:48,942 --> 01:01:50,475
All you have to do
is give it to me.

1334
01:01:50,477 --> 01:01:51,576
- No.

1335
01:01:51,578 --> 01:01:52,577
- No?

1336
01:01:52,579 --> 01:01:53,911
What do you mean, no?

1337
01:01:53,913 --> 01:01:56,047
- Well, I don't want you
to suffer from bad luck either.

1338
01:01:56,049 --> 01:01:57,382
- No, no, no,
it's not like that.

1339
01:01:57,384 --> 01:01:58,450
I don't mind the curse.

1340
01:01:58,452 --> 01:02:00,719
I mean, not anymore.

1341
01:02:00,721 --> 01:02:03,122
I haven't really minded it
since I met you, actually.

1342
01:02:03,124 --> 01:02:04,657
You make things...

1343
01:02:04,659 --> 01:02:05,891
well, you make them okay.

1344
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:07,126
Better than okay...
Happy.

1345
01:02:07,128 --> 01:02:08,794
And we all have stuff
to deal with.

1346
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:11,262
It's all about how
you approach it.

1347
01:02:11,264 --> 01:02:13,564
So?

1348
01:02:13,566 --> 01:02:15,233
Give me the coin.

1349
01:02:16,435 --> 01:02:18,636
- Give her the coin, idiot!

1350
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:25,077
- Okay.

1351
01:02:34,789 --> 01:02:36,589
- Whoa.

1352
01:02:36,591 --> 01:02:37,924
- Ah!

1353
01:02:40,662 --> 01:02:43,296
Help me.

1354
01:02:43,298 --> 01:02:45,965
Please grab my hand.
Grab my hand.

1355
01:02:45,967 --> 01:02:47,233
Please pull me up.

1356
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:59,244
Thanks.

1357
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:00,445
- No problem.

1358
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:28,740
- Now that everything
was back to normal,

1359
01:03:28,742 --> 01:03:30,642
Dad discovered the cookies
from insta cookie

1360
01:03:30,644 --> 01:03:32,544
Turned your teeth blue.

1361
01:03:32,546 --> 01:03:35,413
- Holy smurf,
my teeth are blue.

1362
01:03:37,349 --> 01:03:39,383
I got you, insta cookie.

1363
01:03:39,385 --> 01:03:41,819
We're gonna be rich.

1364
01:03:43,156 --> 01:03:45,123
- So he turned his report in
after all.

1365
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,925
To celebrate, we decided
to take the trip

1366
01:03:46,927 --> 01:03:48,427
That I won at the raffle.

1367
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:50,662
The Murphys, the grand canyon?

1368
01:03:50,664 --> 01:03:53,699
What could go wrong there?

1369
01:03:53,701 --> 01:03:55,834
Charlie's big win
at the skating competition

1370
01:03:55,836 --> 01:03:59,604
Made him realize he doesn't need
the curse to be awesome.

1371
01:04:05,548 --> 01:04:06,747
Best of all,

1372
01:04:06,749 --> 01:04:08,315
I realized that my Mom
was right.

1373
01:04:08,317 --> 01:04:10,083
It didn't matter
if I was cursed.

1374
01:04:10,085 --> 01:04:11,718
I could be anything I wanted.

1375
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:12,720
That's right.

1376
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:13,888
I went to science camp.

1377
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:17,023
I will now add
hydrogen chloride.

1378
01:04:17,025 --> 01:04:18,158
- No, no!
No, no, no, wait!

1379
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:19,292
That's not hydrogen...

1380
01:04:30,137 --> 01:04:31,370
What?

1381
01:04:31,372 --> 01:04:33,138
- Then I realized my bad luck

1382
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:35,174
Could sometimes do good things.

1383
01:04:35,176 --> 01:04:37,777
You're welcome,
bald people everywhere,

1384
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:40,347
And I found out
my great great grandpa

1385
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:42,382
Learned the same thing.

1386
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:44,017
- If i'd never had the curse,

1387
01:04:44,019 --> 01:04:46,152
Then i'd never have been
at the hospital,

1388
01:04:46,154 --> 01:04:48,487
And i'd never have met my edna.

1389
01:04:48,489 --> 01:04:50,990
She makes me happier
than anything.

1390
01:04:50,992 --> 01:04:53,392
And I don't need
this coin anymore.

1391
01:04:53,394 --> 01:04:56,295
'Cause i'm the luckiest guy
in town.

1392
01:04:58,065 --> 01:04:59,466
Splash!

1393
01:05:24,758 --> 01:05:26,959
- Meg, time to go!

1394
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:36,635
- Grandpa.

1395
01:05:36,637 --> 01:05:38,470
- Oh, hi, honey.

1396
01:05:38,472 --> 01:05:40,139
- I'd give you a hug, but...

1397
01:05:40,141 --> 01:05:41,440
- oh, I know.

1398
01:05:41,442 --> 01:05:42,975
It's like hugging
a pregnant orange.

1399
01:05:42,977 --> 01:05:44,943
I still got some kinks
to work out.

1400
01:05:44,945 --> 01:05:46,345
- And I know you will.

1401
01:05:46,347 --> 01:05:48,414
Even though this isn't
the summer that I imagined,

1402
01:05:48,416 --> 01:05:49,415
In some ways it was better.

1403
01:05:49,417 --> 01:05:50,416
- Bye.
- Bye.

1404
01:05:50,418 --> 01:05:51,584
Don't get me wrong.

1405
01:05:51,586 --> 01:05:53,119
I'm happy we're
leaving harvest hills

1406
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:54,354
To go to the grand canyon,

1407
01:05:54,356 --> 01:05:56,356
But i'm going to miss
my new best friend.

1408
01:05:56,358 --> 01:05:57,757
- Meg.
- You heard me right.

1409
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,326
I have a best friend.

1410
01:05:59,328 --> 01:06:00,527
She truly gets me,

1411
01:06:00,529 --> 01:06:01,561
Curse and all.

1412
01:06:01,563 --> 01:06:02,729
What are you guys doing here?

1413
01:06:02,731 --> 01:06:04,130
- We had to come
and say good-Bye

1414
01:06:04,132 --> 01:06:06,165
And remind you about rule 34.

1415
01:06:06,167 --> 01:06:07,333
Careful on road trips.

1416
01:06:07,335 --> 01:06:10,569
- And you be careful
of angry monkeys.

1417
01:06:10,571 --> 01:06:11,570
I'll see you in school.

1418
01:06:11,572 --> 01:06:14,173
- Yeah.

1419
01:06:14,175 --> 01:06:15,874
- Hey.
- Hey.

1420
01:06:23,384 --> 01:06:26,318
- Standing right here.

1421
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:27,553
Okay.

1422
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,326
See you when you get back,
okay?

1423
01:06:35,328 --> 01:06:36,795
Call me when you get there,
all right?

1424
01:06:36,797 --> 01:06:37,829
- Okay.

1425
01:06:37,831 --> 01:06:39,464
See you guys later.

1426
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:46,372
You know, I think we all feel
like we're cursed at times.

1427
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:51,943
- What?

1428
01:06:51,945 --> 01:06:53,578
- Move over, little brother.

1429
01:06:56,616 --> 01:06:58,317
The question is,

1430
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:00,286
Are you gonna let it define
who you are?

1431
01:07:00,288 --> 01:07:02,722
- Hey, Dad, we're going
to the grand canyon, right?

1432
01:07:02,724 --> 01:07:03,857
- Yep.

1433
01:07:03,859 --> 01:07:05,759
- But isn't
Murphy rule number 82

1434
01:07:05,761 --> 01:07:07,127
To stay away from canyons?

1435
01:07:07,129 --> 01:07:10,363
- I think it's time
we bent the rules just a little.

1436
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:16,570
Both: uh-Oh.

1437
01:07:18,272 --> 01:07:20,306
- Uh-Oh.

1438
01:07:20,308 --> 01:07:21,340
Zap!

1439
01:07:21,342 --> 01:07:24,443
- Whoo!
