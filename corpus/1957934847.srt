WHERE ARE THEY?

1592
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,390
THEY'RE
IN A SAFE PLACE,

1593
01:25:36,490 --> 01:25:39,160
AND IF YOU LET US GO
AND NOTHING HAPPENS TO US,

1594
01:25:39,260 --> 01:25:42,130
THAT'S WHERE
THEY'RE GONNA STAY.

á[ Chuckling ]

1596
01:26:00,380 --> 01:26:01,820
WHERE'D YOU
PUT THE FILES?

1597
01:26:01,920 --> 01:26:04,450
OH, I SENT THEM
TO A SAFE PLACE.

1598
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:06,360
DO YOU
TRUST THE PERSON
YOU SENT THEM TO?

1599
01:26:06,460 --> 01:26:08,420
OH, I THINK SO.

1600
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,160
WHO'D YOU
SEND THEM TO?

1601
01:26:10,260 --> 01:26:12,130
WELL, I SENT THEM
TO MYSELF, ACTUALLY.

1602
01:26:12,230 --> 01:26:13,330
OH.

1603
01:26:13,430 --> 01:26:14,000
OH.

1604
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:16,060
GOOD THINKING.

1605
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,280
WELL,
GOOD BYE.

1606
01:26:37,990 --> 01:26:42,160
UMMM, JOE,
I'M SORRY ABOUT,

1607
01:26:42,260 --> 01:26:44,590
YOU KNOW, ALL THIS.

1608
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,930
FORGET
ABOUT IT, KID.

1609
01:26:46,030 --> 01:26:48,130
COME ON, CHARLIE.

1610
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:50,870
YOU DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYBODY.

1611
01:26:50,970 --> 01:26:55,100
YOU REALLY OUGHT TO
GO SEE YOUR SON.

1612
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:59,870
I HEARD YOU
THE OTHER NIGHT.

1613
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:02,780
YOU KNOW,
CHARLIE,
I DON'T KNOW.

1614
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,450
IT'S BEEN
TEN YEARS.

1615
01:27:04,550 --> 01:27:06,980
I DON'T THINK
HE WANTS TO SEE ME.

1616
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:10,920
MY MOM,
SHE LEFT ME
WHEN I WAS 2.

1617
01:27:11,020 --> 01:27:13,260
AND I TELL EVERYONE
SHE'S DEAD.

1618
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:16,360
BUT AS MUCH
AS I SAY I HATE HER,

1619
01:27:16,460 --> 01:27:20,230
I REALLY WOULD LIKE
TO SEE HER AGAIN.

1620
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:25,530
WELL, BYE, JOE.

1621
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,500
GOOD BYE,
CHARLIE.

1622
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,480
DAD.

1623
01:27:42,590 --> 01:27:44,590
I'M SORRY.

1624
01:27:44,690 --> 01:27:48,160
I WAS ONLY THINKING
OF MYSELF

1625
01:27:48,260 --> 01:27:50,360
AND IT WAS
VERY SELFISH.

1626
01:27:50,460 --> 01:27:52,930
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT IT.

1627
01:27:53,030 --> 01:27:58,730
WE'VE HAD A LONG DAY
AND WE'RE BOTH TIRED,

1628
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:01,500
SO LET'S
GET SOME SLEEP.

1629
01:28:25,460 --> 01:28:26,560
OH, NO.

1630
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:29,160
CHARLIE NEEDS
THIS TODAY!

1631
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:40,010
CHARLIE.

1632
01:28:55,430 --> 01:28:59,730
THE PERSON
WHO I WANT TO BE MOST LIKE
WHEN I GROW UP.

1633
01:28:59,830 --> 01:29:01,660
THE PERSON
I WANT TO BE MOST LIKE

1634
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:04,170
WHEN I GROW UP
IS NOT A FAMOUS ATHLETE.

1635
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:06,000
HE DIDN'T HIT
ANY HOME RUNS

1636
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:07,370
IN THE BOTTOM
OF THE 9th

1637
01:29:07,470 --> 01:29:09,600
OR WIN A GOLD MEDAL
AT THE OLYMPICS.

1638
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:13,410
HE'S NOT A FAMOUS PRESIDENT
AND HE DIDN'T INVENT ANYTHING.

1639
01:29:13,510 --> 01:29:15,580
HE'S NOT EVEN
A CELEBRITY.

1640
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:18,380
THE PERSON
I WANT TO BE MOST LIKE
WHEN I GROW UP

1641
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,850
IS JUST
AN AVERAGE EVERYDAY GUY
I HAPPEN TO KNOW.

1642
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:24,290
YOU SEE,
WHEN HIS WIFE LEFT HIM,

1643
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,690
HE GOT STUCK
RAISING A KID
ALL ON HIS OWN.

1644
01:29:26,790 --> 01:29:29,490
WHICH MEANS
YOU GOTTA GO TO WORK
TO PAY THE BILLS

1645
01:29:29,590 --> 01:29:31,030
AND DO
THE GROCERY SHOPPING

1646
01:29:31,130 --> 01:29:32,760
AND BE ON DIAPER DUTY.

1647
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:36,060
THAT COULD CUT
INTO SOCIAL LIFE.

1648
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,730
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER
THAT HE'S A TERRIBLE COOK.

1649
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,130
I'D NEVER
TELL HIM THAT

1650
01:29:40,240 --> 01:29:42,000
BECAUSE IT WOULD HURT
HIS FEELINGS.

1651
01:29:42,110 --> 01:29:44,440
HE'S THE BEST PERSON
I KNOW

1652
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:46,540
BECAUSE
HE DOES THE THINGS
THAT COUNT.

1653
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:49,080
LIKE PAYING ATTENTION
TO WHAT HIS SON HAS TO SAY.

1654
01:29:49,180 --> 01:29:50,650
NOT LIKE SOME GROWN UP

1655
01:29:50,750 --> 01:29:51,910
WHO PRETENDS
TO LISTEN TO YOU.

1656
01:29:52,020 --> 01:29:55,120
BUT HE
MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
HE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND.

1657
01:29:55,220 --> 01:29:57,890
SOMEONE YOU CAN
JUST TALK TO.

1658
01:29:57,990 --> 01:30:01,960
I KNOW THE PERSON
I JUST DESCRIBED DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE ANYONE SPECIAL,

1659
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:03,630
BUT HE IS TO ME.

1660
01:30:03,730 --> 01:30:10,830
AND THAT'S WHY
WHEN I GROW UP I WANT
TO BE JUST LIKE MY...

1661
01:30:10,930 --> 01:30:13,170
MY DAD.

1662
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:15,600
CHARLIE!

1663
01:30:15,710 --> 01:30:16,970
DAD!

1664
01:30:17,070 --> 01:30:19,410
I THOUGHT
YOU NEEDED THIS.

1665
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:39,490
CHARLIE,
YOU DON'T REALLY
HATE MY COOKING, DO YOU?

1666
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,260
WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THAT LATER.

1667
01:30:47,570 --> 01:30:51,870
