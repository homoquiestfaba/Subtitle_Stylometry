1
00:00:13,093 --> 00:00:14,617
I was thinking this morning:

2
00:00:14,695 --> 00:00:17,960
In two months,
I will have been here ten years.

3
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:21,792
And you're like my real family.
Isn't that tragic?

4
00:00:23,804 --> 00:00:26,602
My mother called
and wished me happy birthday...

5
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:29,699
...and hinted to the fact I wasn't making
enough money.

6
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:33,837
If you can call, "Still making
the same salary, honey?" a hint.

7
00:00:34,548 --> 00:00:38,382
My ex-wife used to say that too,
but she never used the word "honey."

8
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,222
-In three years, can I double my income?
-Good luck.

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,484
-Four years?
-Maybe.

10
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:49,325
You're great people
and this is a great present.

11
00:00:49,463 --> 00:00:52,591
I wish I could squeeze all of you
into one pretty woman.

12
00:00:53,266 --> 00:00:55,894
If you'd like to go into my office, I'll try.

13
00:00:56,236 --> 00:00:57,430
Thanks a lot.

14
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:09,774
I'll be home soon.
I'm taking Daniel to get his new car.

15
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:13,142
-What'd he get?
-BMW convertible.

16
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,743
Oh, my God. Leather?

17
00:01:14,855 --> 00:01:16,254
-Leather?
-Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,820
-I want one.
-All right. Kiss Alex for me.

19
00:01:18,892 --> 00:01:20,883
-I want one.
-She says, "happy birthday."

20
00:01:20,961 --> 00:01:22,792
These are great. Thanks.

21
00:01:23,263 --> 00:01:25,254
-Just stuff I like.
-It's great.

22
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:28,125
Why do you drive this?

23
00:01:29,269 --> 00:01:31,032
I see people driving these.

24
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,339
What, is a flood coming?

25
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,064
Hoover Dam broke?

26
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:36,603
I like this car.

27
00:01:36,676 --> 00:01:40,203
It's a battering ram.
This is what Patton drove.

28
00:01:40,714 --> 00:01:42,614
"Hey, you, soldier, forward."

29
00:01:43,083 --> 00:01:45,677
In an 8.5 earthquake, you'll beg for a Jeep.

30
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:48,516
In an 8.5 earthquake, I'll beg for a coffin.

31
00:01:50,056 --> 00:01:52,957
-What are you doing tonight?
-Taking a long drive.

32
00:01:53,226 --> 00:01:55,786
-Alone?
-Unless someone comes with the car.

33
00:01:56,062 --> 00:01:58,030
You don't want to be alone
on your birthday.

34
00:01:58,098 --> 00:01:59,759
What better day to be alone?

35
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:03,291
I don't have that hang up
about birthdays and parties.

36
00:02:03,804 --> 00:02:05,931
You're born alone, celebrate it.

37
00:02:06,106 --> 00:02:08,904
Celebrate aloneness.
That's what birthdays are for.

38
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:10,774
Never thought of that.

39
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:12,436
It's a pitiful theory.

40
00:02:13,747 --> 00:02:17,012
I've had these cars before
and there's something wrong.

41
00:02:17,951 --> 00:02:19,509
The smell is making me sick.

42
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:21,679
That's a normal smell.

43
00:02:21,755 --> 00:02:24,417
That's a protective coating,
it's not oil burning.

44
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:27,984
-You look fantastic. You lose weight?
-Did I what?

45
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:29,721
I was talking to someone else.

46
00:02:30,063 --> 00:02:32,759
-Did any lights come on the dash?
-I don't think so.

47
00:02:33,366 --> 00:02:36,335
That means you're okay.
If there's any trouble, they come on.

48
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:38,904
We have a saying around here.

49
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:42,875
"If you smell something
and don't see lights, try dry cleaning."

50
00:02:43,009 --> 00:02:44,101
Try what?

51
00:02:44,244 --> 00:02:45,871
She has no sense of humor.

52
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:47,240
Dry cleaning?

53
00:02:48,615 --> 00:02:50,776
If it smells on Monday, bring it in.

54
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:54,186
-I'm sure it's nothing.
-I'm sure it's something.

55
00:02:55,455 --> 00:02:56,945
Trouble with a new car?

56
00:02:57,057 --> 00:03:00,151
She's a lunatic. Boy, you have lost
a lot of weight!

57
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:03,018
A lot of weight?
You saw me three days ago.

58
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:04,824
You look different. Why?

59
00:03:04,931 --> 00:03:07,798
I don't know.
I just wrote you a check for $39,000.

60
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:11,262
That's it. That's the look. $39,000 lighter.

61
00:03:11,638 --> 00:03:13,037
Let's go get it.

62
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,468
Let's get her.

63
00:03:16,877 --> 00:03:18,071
What's in the box?

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,238
-It's my birthday. I got a CD player.
-Happy birthday.

65
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:23,645
-You got a CD player in the car.
-No, I don't.

66
00:03:23,717 --> 00:03:25,116
You paid for it.

67
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:28,085
You wanted the best.
The best radio comes with a CD.

68
00:03:28,488 --> 00:03:29,785
You'll love it.

69
00:03:30,557 --> 00:03:31,717
There she is.

70
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,281
It's gorgeous!

71
00:03:33,727 --> 00:03:36,662
Look at it. It looks huge! It's beautiful!

72
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,431
That's not it. That's a 750. That's it.

73
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:42,627
What a cutie.

74
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:46,733
Try not to show the 750 first.
My car looks like a turd now.

75
00:03:46,973 --> 00:03:50,909
If I had to choose between this car
and yours, I'd take yours every time.

76
00:03:51,545 --> 00:03:53,069
You're an idiot, Jim.

77
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:53,298
Do we all have to hear that?

78
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:25,695
Come to me.

79
00:07:52,018 --> 00:07:54,578
Good afternoon,
and welcome to Judgment City.

80
00:07:55,155 --> 00:07:58,955
You just had quite a journey,
so relax and enjoy the ride.

81
00:07:59,592 --> 00:08:03,585
Considering your recent transformation,
you won't have any choice.

82
00:08:04,063 --> 00:08:06,395
If we've done our work correctly...

83
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,730
...you should all be from
the western half of the United States.

84
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,304
Even though this isn't the Earth...

85
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:15,808
...our surroundings should seem pleasing
and very familiar to you.

86
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:17,974
Why you're here...

87
00:08:18,178 --> 00:08:21,375
...and what you'll be doing
will be explained later.

88
00:08:21,815 --> 00:08:23,680
No need to worry about that now.

89
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:27,213
Soon we'll be dropping you off
at your hotel.

90
00:08:27,554 --> 00:08:30,022
You'll sleep tonight and when you awake...

91
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:32,647
...you'll feel wonderful and raring to go.

92
00:08:33,092 --> 00:08:36,289
You'll find many activities to enjoy
in Judgment City.

93
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:39,558
How many like to play golf?

94
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:43,763
You won't be able to get
your hands up yet...

95
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:46,839
...but we have
three championship golf courses.

96
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:49,602
Sit back and have fun.

97
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:54,173
You'll be here for five days
and we want you to enjoy yourselves.

98
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:09,228
Those staying at the Continental Hotel
will be escorted from the tram.

99
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:12,831
The rest of us will depart momentarily.
Thank you.

100
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:20,435
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome.
My name is Stan.

101
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:25,203
Because of what you've been through,
you'll want to go fast asleep.

102
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:28,843
You're already checked in.
Nothing to worry about tonight.

103
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:31,480
Everything will be explained tomorrow.

104
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:35,620
Have a good rest.
If you have any questions, I'm here to help.

105
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:37,313
Thank you.

106
00:09:41,427 --> 00:09:42,758
Excuse me, sir.

107
00:09:45,298 --> 00:09:48,165
Mr. Miller, this is your room.
Make yourself at home.

108
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:49,530
I'll be right back.

109
00:10:13,493 --> 00:10:17,429
All the clothing you'll need for the time
you're here is in this closet.

110
00:10:17,931 --> 00:10:22,334
We call these tupas.
They're like caftans. They fit everyone.

111
00:10:23,102 --> 00:10:25,696
Would you like to shower,
or are you too tired?

112
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:29,639
Too tired?

113
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:36,080
I understand. There are five channels
of programming on the television.

114
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:38,950
Channel 3 tells you about Judgment City.

115
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:43,446
Have a wonderful night's sleep.
If I can do anything, I'm at your service.

116
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:54,666
I'd be surprised if there's anything in there,
but I appreciate the attempt.

117
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:57,703
Sleep well.

118
00:11:18,925 --> 00:11:20,392
Good morning, Alan.

119
00:11:20,893 --> 00:11:22,417
Good morning, Philip.

120
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,425
Glad you could make it, Leonard.

121
00:11:26,432 --> 00:11:29,128
-Good morning, Susan.
-Good morning, Mr. Diamond.

122
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:41,471
-Who's prosecuting?
-Lena Foster.

123
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,046
She'll have a field day with this.

124
00:11:51,257 --> 00:11:52,884
She lost last Thursday.

125
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,215
Really?

126
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,857
There is a God.

127
00:11:56,729 --> 00:11:58,458
Okay, call him up, please.

128
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,511
-Hold on for Bob Diamond, please.
-Who?

129
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:26,416
Daniel?

130
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,127
Diamond here. How are you? Good sleep?

131
00:12:30,797 --> 00:12:32,492
-Yes.
-Amazing, isn't it?

132
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,761
Listen, you're going to get up, shower,
put on those nice clothes...

133
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:41,135
...and take a tram downtown
and come see me this morning.

134
00:12:42,308 --> 00:12:43,900
Do you know what's going on?

135
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:45,843
No.

136
00:12:46,012 --> 00:12:50,039
In a nutshell, you're here
to defend your life. And I'll help you.

137
00:12:51,617 --> 00:12:52,777
Defend my life?

138
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:56,349
Soon, you'll be smarter than anyone
you've ever met.

139
00:12:56,622 --> 00:12:57,782
Sound exciting?

140
00:12:58,524 --> 00:12:59,513
I guess.

141
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:01,215
It is, believe me.

142
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,056
Did you eat breakfast yet?

143
00:13:03,996 --> 00:13:04,792
No.

144
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,661
I've got good news for you.

145
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:10,892
It's not only the best food you'll ever have,
but you can eat all you want.

146
00:13:11,604 --> 00:13:12,628
I can what?

147
00:13:12,772 --> 00:13:17,232
As long as you're here, you can eat
all you want. You won't gain weight.

148
00:13:17,977 --> 00:13:22,073
So pig-out. Eat 30 hotcakes.
I'll see you at 1 1 :00.

149
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,743
Eat all I want?

150
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:26,976
Eat everything. Take care.

151
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,667
I've loved you from the day I met you.

152
00:13:49,842 --> 00:13:52,743
When did you meet me?
Do you remember?

153
00:13:53,713 --> 00:13:54,975
Don't do this to me.

154
00:13:55,615 --> 00:13:57,173
Of course, I remember.

155
00:13:57,283 --> 00:13:58,750
What's my middle name?

156
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:02,216
-You never told me.
-It's the first thing I told you.

157
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:03,984
In which life?

158
00:14:04,991 --> 00:14:06,288
In which life?

159
00:14:10,029 --> 00:14:14,898
That's it, Lenore. You tried,
and you failed. The game is over for you.

160
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:17,535
Stay here and someone
will come and get you.

161
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:19,865
Stu, the decision is yours.

162
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:23,202
Do you want to stop here,
or face your fear?

163
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,176
I'll face the fear.

164
00:14:25,711 --> 00:14:27,235
He's facing his fear!

165
00:14:31,817 --> 00:14:34,251
You might just get a hole in one.

166
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,651
Want to eat a lot?

167
00:14:36,889 --> 00:14:41,053
Ted's House of Buffet says you can have
everything you see, plus more.

168
00:14:41,327 --> 00:14:44,455
Our chefs will cook it, but they won't look.

169
00:14:44,864 --> 00:14:46,388
Like to horseback ride?

170
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:49,298
Judgment Stables, open till sunset,
welcomes you.

171
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:53,635
If your trial's through early,
come ride with us.

172
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,614
Good morning.

173
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:14,682
Good morning.

174
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,762
"Take the eggs, I pray thee."

175
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,598
What's good here?

176
00:15:25,905 --> 00:15:27,600
Everything is sensational.

177
00:15:28,407 --> 00:15:30,341
-How's the cheese omelet?
-Sensational.

178
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:33,674
-I'll take it and some orange juice.
-I'll be right back.

179
00:15:48,127 --> 00:15:49,890
Was this made for somebody else?

180
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,224
No, just for you.

181
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:52,620
That fast?

182
00:15:52,798 --> 00:15:55,096
Fast and delicious. Eat all you want.

183
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:08,609
-Delicious.
-That's nice.

184
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:12,681
A red tram is leaving right now
that will get you into town by 1 1 :00.

185
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:15,682
To make sure you're on time,
you should leave now.

186
00:16:16,522 --> 00:16:18,353
These are the best eggs I ever had.

187
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:19,751
Of course.

188
00:16:23,162 --> 00:16:26,962
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to the lnner City Transport System.

189
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,726
Please remain seated
until the tram comes to a full stop.

190
00:16:31,037 --> 00:16:33,028
Never exit the tram once it's moving...

191
00:16:33,172 --> 00:16:36,699
...because of the electronic field
surrounding the moving vehicle.

192
00:16:57,963 --> 00:17:00,295
So young. AIDS?

193
00:17:02,234 --> 00:17:03,462
Car accident.

194
00:17:03,602 --> 00:17:05,035
Oh, my God!

195
00:17:05,271 --> 00:17:09,002
-But you feel okay now, don't you?
-Yes, I do.

196
00:17:09,475 --> 00:17:10,772
Me, too.

197
00:17:11,977 --> 00:17:16,641
Isn't it amazing? ls this what you thought
it would be? I certainly didn't.

198
00:17:16,749 --> 00:17:19,013
I don't know what it is yet. Do you?

199
00:17:19,218 --> 00:17:21,049
No, I guess I don't.

200
00:17:27,393 --> 00:17:30,157
You make me think of my little poodle.

201
00:17:31,664 --> 00:17:33,256
Do you have a dog?

202
00:17:33,366 --> 00:17:35,197
I did have a dog.

203
00:17:36,635 --> 00:17:38,762
I'll tell you about my dog.

204
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,668
I had a little....

205
00:17:42,074 --> 00:17:44,304
-Have you got a while?
-Yeah, go ahead.

206
00:17:51,584 --> 00:17:55,680
They let us on the train in those days.
We didn't have to put him in baggage.

207
00:17:55,788 --> 00:17:58,848
Every time the conductor came around,
he knew it.

208
00:17:59,058 --> 00:18:01,891
And he would crawl down
in the corner of the bag.

209
00:18:02,795 --> 00:18:05,628
-Did you have a dog?
-You asked me that twice.

210
00:18:05,931 --> 00:18:07,592
-What did you say?
-Yes.

211
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:09,860
-What did I say?
-It's wonderful.

212
00:18:10,136 --> 00:18:11,296
Well, it is.

213
00:18:15,641 --> 00:18:19,975
Mr. Miller, welcome. I'm Helen,
one of Mr. Diamond's assistants.

214
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,837
Come with me, please.

215
00:18:27,019 --> 00:18:29,487
-Looks familiar, right?
-I was just thinking that.

216
00:18:29,588 --> 00:18:33,649
It was designed to be as stress-free
for you folks as possible.

217
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:38,520
If we can do anything to make it
more like Earth, we have suggestion boxes.

218
00:18:38,597 --> 00:18:39,962
We'd like your opinion.

219
00:18:41,133 --> 00:18:45,536
If you want to make it more like Earth,
you should build some mini-malls.

220
00:18:46,105 --> 00:18:49,734
It's funny you should say that.
Six just opened up outside of town.

221
00:18:50,075 --> 00:18:51,542
I hear they're lovely.

222
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:56,307
I never go because I don't like yogurt
and I do my own nails.

223
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,580
Mr. Diamond will be with you shortly.

224
00:19:21,106 --> 00:19:23,233
Daniel, Bob Diamond.

225
00:19:24,009 --> 00:19:24,976
Come in.

226
00:19:27,513 --> 00:19:28,673
How are you?

227
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:32,907
Sit down, my friend.

228
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,292
What's wrong?

229
00:19:49,502 --> 00:19:52,960
You look good in that tupa.
Some people don't, but you do.

230
00:19:53,205 --> 00:19:54,729
It's flattering to you.

231
00:19:56,442 --> 00:19:58,910
So, is this what you thought it would be?

232
00:19:59,311 --> 00:20:02,371
Thought what would be?
Where am l? Heaven?

233
00:20:02,515 --> 00:20:04,005
No, it isn't heaven.

234
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,548
-Is it hell?
-No, it isn't hell either.

235
00:20:07,219 --> 00:20:11,349
Actually, there is no hell. But I hear
Los Angeles is getting pretty close.

236
00:20:15,528 --> 00:20:17,962
Daniel, let me tell you what's going on.

237
00:20:19,331 --> 00:20:23,290
When you're born into this universe,
you're in it for a long time.

238
00:20:23,936 --> 00:20:27,531
You have many different lifetimes.
After each one...

239
00:20:27,706 --> 00:20:30,607
...there's an examining period,
which you're in now.

240
00:20:31,944 --> 00:20:35,209
Every second of every lifetime
is recorded...

241
00:20:35,814 --> 00:20:38,510
...and as each one ends,
we sort of look at it.

242
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:41,378
Look at a few of the days, examine it...

243
00:20:42,154 --> 00:20:44,418
...and if everyone agrees,
you move forward.

244
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:48,916
-What do you mean "move forward"?
-Continue onward.

245
00:20:48,994 --> 00:20:52,122
The point of the whole thing is
to keep getting smarter.

246
00:20:52,398 --> 00:20:53,797
To keep growing...

247
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:58,394
...to use as much of your brain as possible.
I use 48 percent of my brain.

248
00:20:58,804 --> 00:20:59,828
How much do you use?

249
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:03,267
47.

250
00:21:04,743 --> 00:21:05,675
3.

251
00:21:06,178 --> 00:21:07,167
I'm sorry?

252
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:08,278
3.

253
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:10,239
I use 3 percent of my brain?

254
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:14,241
Don't worry. Everybody on Earth
uses 3 percent of their brain.

255
00:21:14,887 --> 00:21:17,481
3 to 5 percent.
That's why they're there.

256
00:21:17,756 --> 00:21:19,724
3? 3 percent?

257
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,387
No one on Earth uses more than that?

258
00:21:22,595 --> 00:21:26,463
When you use more than 5 percent
you don't want to be on Earth.

259
00:21:26,832 --> 00:21:28,959
Though your take-out places are lovely...

260
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:32,299
...there are more exciting destinations
for smarter people.

261
00:21:33,772 --> 00:21:37,833
Being from Earth as you are,
and using as little of your brain as you do...

262
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:41,709
...your life is devoted to dealing with fear.

263
00:21:42,281 --> 00:21:43,111
It has?

264
00:21:43,415 --> 00:21:47,408
Everybody on Earth deals with fear.
That's what Little Brains do.

265
00:21:48,821 --> 00:21:50,254
What are "Little Brains"?

266
00:21:50,556 --> 00:21:53,047
That's what we call you folks
behind your back.

267
00:21:58,297 --> 00:21:59,457
Forgive me.

268
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,160
Who are you?

269
00:22:02,434 --> 00:22:03,799
I'm just like you.

270
00:22:04,436 --> 00:22:06,427
I was on Earth a long time ago.

271
00:22:07,072 --> 00:22:10,530
But I advanced, I moved forward.
I got over my fears.

272
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:13,907
And I got smarter.
Did your friends' stomachs hurt?

273
00:22:13,979 --> 00:22:15,879
-Everyone of them.
-It's fear.

274
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:17,879
Fear is like a giant fog.

275
00:22:18,417 --> 00:22:20,476
It blocks everything.

276
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:24,377
Real feelings, true happiness, real joy.

277
00:22:24,857 --> 00:22:26,882
They can't get through that fog.

278
00:22:27,426 --> 00:22:28,791
But you lift it...

279
00:22:29,161 --> 00:22:32,289
...and you're in for the ride of your life.

280
00:22:33,098 --> 00:22:35,032
God, my 3 percent is swimming.

281
00:22:39,672 --> 00:22:42,106
-What are you reading?
-You wouldn't understand.

282
00:22:42,241 --> 00:22:43,868
Just numbers.

283
00:22:43,942 --> 00:22:45,807
-You read numbers?
-Yes, sir.

284
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:49,375
I'm on trial for being afraid?

285
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:52,642
First, I don't like to call it a "trial."
Second, yes.

286
00:22:54,853 --> 00:22:58,254
-What happens if I'm guilty?
-Don't think "innocent" or "guilty."

287
00:22:58,657 --> 00:23:01,558
Worse comes to worse,
you'll go back to Earth and try again.

288
00:23:01,927 --> 00:23:04,327
You keep going back until you get it right?

289
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:07,763
Not forever.
Eventually, they'll throw you away.

290
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:11,469
-Have I been to Earth before?
-Yeah.

291
00:23:11,537 --> 00:23:13,368
-How many times?
-Approaching 20.

292
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:16,240
-Is that a lot?
-I was there six.

293
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:19,543
My God! So I'm the dunce of the Universe.

294
00:23:19,745 --> 00:23:22,543
We've had people
who have been there 100 times.

295
00:23:23,015 --> 00:23:26,007
I wouldn't want them as friends,
but we've seen them.

296
00:23:26,618 --> 00:23:30,281
If you're defending me,
is there a prosecutor?

297
00:23:30,556 --> 00:23:32,387
Damn good one. Lena Foster.

298
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,989
We call her "The Dragon Lady."

299
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:37,887
That's our prosecutor?

300
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:41,027
-Who does she work for?
-The Universe.

301
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,092
The Universe is like a big machine,
and we are parts.

302
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:46,804
If a bad part gets through
before it's ready...

303
00:23:46,905 --> 00:23:49,567
...the whole machine breaks down.

304
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,242
We're here to make sure you're ready.

305
00:23:53,445 --> 00:23:56,972
-What do they look at exactly?
-I can't tell you that exactly.

306
00:23:57,216 --> 00:24:00,379
But I can tell you
it's nine days from your life.

307
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:04,817
Nine days.
So my trial goes on for nine days?

308
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:07,385
No. All the trials last four days.

309
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:10,894
We look at nine days, or episodes,
from your life.

310
00:24:11,263 --> 00:24:13,629
-Tell me which days.
-I'm not allowed.

311
00:24:14,032 --> 00:24:17,365
Is that a normal number? High? Low?
ls that a good number?

312
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:20,904
You're very concerned about normal.
Kind of cute.

313
00:24:21,807 --> 00:24:25,072
I'd prefer seven, but nine's fine.
Some have twelve.

314
00:24:25,944 --> 00:24:29,141
-Hungry?
-Starving. I didn't have time to eat.

315
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:32,445
Well, Mr. All-You-Can-Eat, let's stuff.
Come on.

316
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,588
We have about 400,000 residents here.

317
00:24:41,026 --> 00:24:45,019
We service half of the US's dead.
About 2,500 people a day.

318
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:48,993
Do children come here?

319
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:51,736
Children don't have to defend themselves.

320
00:24:51,837 --> 00:24:54,863
When a child is taken,
they automatically move forward.

321
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,473
Isn't that nice?

322
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:57,969
Any teenagers?

323
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:02,239
Too much trouble. They go elsewhere.
We tried, but they damaged the tupas.

324
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:03,573
Too rowdy.

325
00:25:04,283 --> 00:25:05,773
How is your chicken?

326
00:25:05,984 --> 00:25:07,178
Delicious.

327
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:17,027
-What are you eating?
-You wouldn't like this.

328
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:19,658
What does it taste like?

329
00:25:20,866 --> 00:25:23,858
You're curious, aren't you? I like that.

330
00:25:25,037 --> 00:25:28,006
-Want to try?
-Yeah. Looks so weird.

331
00:25:33,712 --> 00:25:36,112
-Oh, my God!
-Like horseshit, huh?

332
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:40,814
As you get smarter,
you manipulate your senses.

333
00:25:40,886 --> 00:25:43,286
This tastes different to me than to you.

334
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:46,884
This is what smart people eat?

335
00:25:48,193 --> 00:25:50,593
So talk to me. Tell me about your life.

336
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:53,264
You feel you had any problems?

337
00:25:53,899 --> 00:25:55,696
Sure. I had some problems.

338
00:25:55,901 --> 00:25:57,960
Everybody has problems, don't they?

339
00:25:58,437 --> 00:26:00,268
Everybody on Earth.

340
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,768
Did you give a lot to charity?

341
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:04,442
A lot?

342
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:07,376
A lot of money. Did you donate things?

343
00:26:07,846 --> 00:26:11,009
This isn't a good or a bad thing.
I'm merely curious.

344
00:26:12,317 --> 00:26:14,410
I'm sure I could have given more.

345
00:26:16,889 --> 00:26:19,824
I gave a lot to street people,
but you never get a receipt.

346
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,792
How much do you have to give?
What's the total?

347
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:27,263
Don't worry.

348
00:26:27,332 --> 00:26:28,321
Relax.

349
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:31,797
There was one person
you were really cheap with.

350
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:36,207
Over and over again.
I wish you'd been more generous with him.

351
00:26:36,708 --> 00:26:37,470
Who?

352
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,040
You.

353
00:26:39,711 --> 00:26:42,271
-I got to go.
-Where do you go now?

354
00:26:43,181 --> 00:26:47,618
You wouldn't understand.
That's not an insult. I mean it literally.

355
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:52,551
Get out tonight. Have some fun.
You know what you might try?

356
00:26:53,325 --> 00:26:55,259
Get over to the Past Lives Pavilion.

357
00:26:55,327 --> 00:26:56,316
What is that?

358
00:26:56,428 --> 00:26:59,056
It's where you see
the people you've been before.

359
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:02,361
You see yourself in other lives?

360
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:05,161
Most people love it,
but some it makes nauseous.

361
00:27:06,505 --> 00:27:07,995
Don't worry about it.

362
00:27:09,975 --> 00:27:11,101
Take care.

363
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:16,010
Want to take that chicken with you?
They love putting things in bags.

364
00:27:16,381 --> 00:27:19,407
If you need to talk to me at any time,
just call.

365
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:21,179
-I never sleep.
-Never?

366
00:27:23,689 --> 00:27:25,350
I do have a question.

367
00:27:25,557 --> 00:27:26,888
I'll call you later.

368
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:43,040
You're already checked in. You have
nothing to worry about tonight.

369
00:27:43,208 --> 00:27:46,109
Everything will be explained to you
in the morning.

370
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:24,239
If I told you how old this man was,
you wouldn't believe me.

371
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:28,246
Should I tell them?
We're talking light years.

372
00:28:28,487 --> 00:28:31,081
Light years. He looks good though.

373
00:28:31,323 --> 00:28:33,416
No prostate, but he looks fine.

374
00:28:35,861 --> 00:28:39,024
You're looking at me like stunned sheep.
Come on!

375
00:28:39,631 --> 00:28:41,622
What is this, a white sale?

376
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,869
I'm going to tell you a story.

377
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:49,139
About a year ago,
this Little Brain comes in here.

378
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:50,774
I'm talking...

379
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:53,170
...half a percent of his brain at the most.

380
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:55,802
He orders a piece of pie,
he forgets what it is.

381
00:28:55,881 --> 00:28:59,282
He looks down, doesn't know what it is.
It's a piece of pie.

382
00:28:59,384 --> 00:29:02,785
I say, "What are you doing?"
He says, "I'm waiting to make a call."

383
00:29:03,422 --> 00:29:06,482
I say, "Does that look like a phone?"
He says, "It is a phone."

384
00:29:07,526 --> 00:29:10,859
The joke is on me.
He picked up the pie and called his mother!

385
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:14,526
Folks, come on, please.
Stay with me here.

386
00:29:14,666 --> 00:29:16,429
You're on trial, not me.

387
00:29:17,035 --> 00:29:19,026
-Hi. What's your name?
-Arthur.

388
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,964
-Hi, Arthur? Where were you from?
-Denver.

389
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:25,670
-Lovely city, Denver, Arthur. Did you ski?
-No.

390
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:27,779
No.

391
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,674
-How'd you die?
-I was in a coma.

392
00:29:31,183 --> 00:29:33,583
I'm sorry. How long were you in a coma?

393
00:29:34,386 --> 00:29:35,876
I really don't know.

394
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:37,581
Let's play a game.

395
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:40,591
-Elvis. Living or dead?
-Living.

396
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,791
Long coma, Art.

397
00:29:43,295 --> 00:29:44,387
Long coma.

398
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:45,922
Have a nice day.

399
00:29:46,865 --> 00:29:48,526
-What's your name?
-Ernie.

400
00:29:48,733 --> 00:29:50,928
Hi. Having a good time in Judgment City?

401
00:29:51,036 --> 00:29:53,231
It's fun. The food's good.

402
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:57,841
It is. Have you been to the stables?
Like to horseback ride?

403
00:29:58,376 --> 00:29:59,673
Not very much.

404
00:30:00,812 --> 00:30:04,111
There's a nice-looking young man.
Hi. How'd you die?

405
00:30:04,483 --> 00:30:05,916
On stage, like you.

406
00:30:09,688 --> 00:30:11,849
Funny. Maybe you should come up here.

407
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,418
No, thank you.

408
00:30:13,558 --> 00:30:18,222
Of course, he doesn't want to.
This is very hard work, but I love it.

409
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:22,662
And I love you, Little Brains.
Have you heard any Little Brain jokes?

410
00:30:24,469 --> 00:30:25,868
I know you, right?

411
00:30:26,037 --> 00:30:27,504
I hope so. Who are you?

412
00:30:27,806 --> 00:30:30,138
-I'm Julia.
-Hi. I'm Daniel.

413
00:30:30,742 --> 00:30:33,506
-You know me?
-I thought I did.

414
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:35,409
You weren't in the bus, were you?

415
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,243
-What bus?
-I hit a bus.

416
00:30:37,449 --> 00:30:39,144
No. I don't think so.

417
00:30:39,217 --> 00:30:40,241
Sit down.

418
00:30:41,486 --> 00:30:43,545
I'm sorry, you really look...

419
00:30:44,122 --> 00:30:46,113
-...so familiar to me.
-Really?

420
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:48,653
Maybe because I'm the only man
under 100.

421
00:30:51,429 --> 00:30:52,589
That could be it.

422
00:30:57,068 --> 00:30:59,093
I want to tell you a true story.

423
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:02,138
Three months ago,
six dead people came in.

424
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:05,776
Obviously, humor has nothing to do
with brain size.

425
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:06,936
Obviously.

426
00:31:07,612 --> 00:31:11,776
Do you want to take a walk
or do you want to stay and see the show?

427
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:14,078
I have to. That's my dad.

428
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,619
I'm kidding.

429
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,119
-That would be so sad for me.
-Awful.

430
00:31:25,797 --> 00:31:29,858
So, the moral of the story is,
if you got to fart, go outside.

431
00:31:30,068 --> 00:31:31,160
Let's go.

432
00:31:31,536 --> 00:31:32,764
Folks, please.

433
00:31:32,871 --> 00:31:36,432
-Please, you don't want to miss the song.
-We'll get the record.

434
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:37,371
Please.

435
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:42,070
Ed and I'd like to do a beautiful song.
One of your favorites.

436
00:31:42,781 --> 00:31:46,182
We'll do it a bit different.
This is from me...

437
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:48,311
...to you.

438
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:54,318
"That was life

439
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:59,194
"That's how you lived it

440
00:32:00,932 --> 00:32:04,561
"And now you Little Brains
are here to defend it"

441
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,537
I'm glad we stayed.

442
00:32:06,871 --> 00:32:07,929
Let's go.

443
00:32:08,306 --> 00:32:10,672
"You'll do just swell and if not

444
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:13,409
"You'll go to hell" Just kidding!

445
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:17,414
-What's that?
-What?

446
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,809
I don't believe you.

447
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,214
You'll make a great baby in the next life.

448
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:30,192
Didn't anyone ever tell you,
you carry yourself very stiffly?

449
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:32,260
Leave me alone. I'm dead.

450
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:37,892
-How many days are you looking at?
-My lawyer says nine.

451
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:40,369
-You call him a "Iawyer"?
-What do you call yours?

452
00:32:40,438 --> 00:32:41,405
Sam.

453
00:32:41,806 --> 00:32:45,503
You call him by his first name?
It never occurred to me to do that.

454
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,871
I bet you called everybody
by their first names.

455
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:49,743
What was your butcher's name?

456
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:51,070
Pete.

457
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:54,719
-What about your mailman?
-Jesse. What was your mailman's name?

458
00:32:54,786 --> 00:32:55,775
No idea.

459
00:32:56,288 --> 00:32:59,917
He was coming to my house
for over a decade and I couldn't tell you.

460
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:04,222
-Didn't you get him a Christmas present?
-Liquor. I just put it in the box.

461
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:07,821
-I don't suppose you had a butcher?
-Steve.

462
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:10,261
-Steve Rubin.
-Seriously?

463
00:33:10,502 --> 00:33:14,495
He wasn't a professional butcher.
He was a buddy who liked to cut meat.

464
00:33:17,676 --> 00:33:20,008
You'd bring him a steak, he'd cut it.

465
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:23,570
-How many days are you looking at?
-Four.

466
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:25,209
That's all?

467
00:33:25,717 --> 00:33:27,412
That means you'll go on.

468
00:33:27,886 --> 00:33:28,978
I hope so.

469
00:33:29,888 --> 00:33:31,617
-Sam thinks so.
-Sam does?

470
00:33:31,923 --> 00:33:32,912
Yeah.

471
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:36,649
I hope you and Sam are very happy.
I'll write to you from hell.

472
00:33:39,798 --> 00:33:40,992
I like this.

473
00:33:43,635 --> 00:33:45,262
-Were you married?
-Yes.

474
00:33:46,371 --> 00:33:47,668
-Children?
-No.

475
00:33:48,306 --> 00:33:49,568
What about you?

476
00:33:50,442 --> 00:33:52,876
I had a girl and I adopted a boy.

477
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:54,577
How old were they?

478
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:58,377
Stephanie was 7 and Adam was 9.

479
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,740
I bet they miss you.

480
00:34:02,287 --> 00:34:03,754
I'm sure they do.

481
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:06,783
I miss them.

482
00:34:07,792 --> 00:34:10,590
But I feel okay about it. Don't you?

483
00:34:10,962 --> 00:34:12,862
I didn't know them that well.

484
00:34:14,032 --> 00:34:15,795
It does, it feels okay.

485
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:21,936
They say they make it that way so we
can look at our lives without distractions.

486
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:25,176
My lawyer Bob told me the same thing.

487
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,145
But wouldn't you call this...

488
00:34:29,414 --> 00:34:30,813
...a distraction?

489
00:34:33,184 --> 00:34:37,086
-But isn't eating all you want a distraction?
-Isn't it the best?

490
00:34:37,188 --> 00:34:40,954
I had a dream that I'd go to a place
where I could eat all I want...

491
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,558
...and now I'm here!

492
00:34:42,627 --> 00:34:44,254
You dreamed about this place?

493
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:47,821
I was dreaming
about the Sizzler near my house.

494
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:55,329
What about your husband?
Did you have a good marriage?

495
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:57,966
Parts of it were okay.

496
00:35:01,246 --> 00:35:02,577
What about your wife?

497
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:04,611
I got married too young.

498
00:35:05,216 --> 00:35:07,309
-How old were you?
-Seventy-one.

499
00:35:12,557 --> 00:35:15,458
-What did she look like?
-Very pretty. Too pretty.

500
00:35:16,494 --> 00:35:21,158
You should be with a person who's just
good-looking enough to turn you on.

501
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:25,060
Any excess brings problems.
She was much prettier than I needed.

502
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:27,298
Never heard that theory before.

503
00:35:27,906 --> 00:35:29,897
So you like your lawyer?

504
00:35:30,508 --> 00:35:33,500
He's brilliant.
You know how big his brain is?

505
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:39,014
I came from a world filled with penis envy
to a world of brain envy.

506
00:35:39,717 --> 00:35:41,241
How big is his brain?

507
00:35:51,062 --> 00:35:53,030
-What's this?
-It's my hotel.

508
00:36:00,772 --> 00:36:04,208
-This is your hotel?
-Yeah. Where are you staying?

509
00:36:04,342 --> 00:36:08,210
At the place for people who weren't
generous and didn't adopt anybody.

510
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:12,013
I'm at the Continental. Come over one day.
We'll paint it.

511
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:15,477
Tomorrow after the trials,
do you want to have dinner?

512
00:36:15,653 --> 00:36:17,052
I can't tomorrow.

513
00:36:17,589 --> 00:36:19,216
-You can't?
-No, I'm sorry.

514
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:23,090
You can't have plans here already?
Should I call you in two weeks?

515
00:36:23,595 --> 00:36:25,756
Sam is having a small dinner party.

516
00:36:26,097 --> 00:36:30,261
He said there'd be very smart people there
and asked me to go.

517
00:36:31,102 --> 00:36:32,160
Sam again.

518
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,971
I hope you're not dating your defender.
I know in my heart it's wrong.

519
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:41,541
I'll call you after the dinner.
We can talk on the phone.

520
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:44,081
It'll give me time to have sex
with my prosecutor.

521
00:36:46,985 --> 00:36:48,452
Good luck tomorrow.

522
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:55,819
Good night.

523
00:36:59,731 --> 00:37:02,825
Champagne and caviar now being served
in the Blue Room.

524
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,040
Daniel! Right here!

525
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,717
How are you feeling, buddy?

526
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:26,387
Doing all right? Let's go.

527
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,251
-Nervous?
-No. Should I be?

528
00:37:31,462 --> 00:37:32,724
I wouldn't be.

529
00:37:33,831 --> 00:37:36,891
-What did you do last night?
-I met this amazing woman.

530
00:37:37,569 --> 00:37:39,730
You met a girl? You're kidding me!

531
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:42,663
What are you laughing at?

532
00:37:42,774 --> 00:37:44,036
It just sounds funny.

533
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:47,202
Two days after the car accident
and you're in love.

534
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,375
I've done this a million times
and every time it feels like new.

535
00:37:52,450 --> 00:37:53,610
Here we are.

536
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:54,909
Ready?

537
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:02,086
Hello, Robert.

538
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,822
Well, well. If it isn't my old friend.

539
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,924
I heard we lost last Thursday.

540
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:12,133
-Leave it to you to greet me with that.
-Turnabout's fair play.

541
00:38:13,438 --> 00:38:14,962
I'm going to get you.

542
00:38:15,873 --> 00:38:16,931
I promise.

543
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,143
Don't make conversation.

544
00:38:25,216 --> 00:38:26,706
Are you two feuding?

545
00:38:26,918 --> 00:38:30,376
It isn't a feud. Feuding suggests
at one time you liked each other.

546
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:31,716
We never did.

547
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:35,623
-This should be a mistrial.
-It's not a trial.

548
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:38,954
Then it's a mis-whatever it is.
You two are already fighting.

549
00:38:40,965 --> 00:38:42,592
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

550
00:38:47,605 --> 00:38:52,235
I'm sure your defender explained
the basics to you, but let me just say...

551
00:38:52,377 --> 00:38:55,107
...even though this feels like a trial, it isn't.

552
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:58,004
It's just a process that helps us decide.

553
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:01,447
As imperfect as it may be,
we think it works quite well.

554
00:39:01,953 --> 00:39:03,978
What you'll see on the screen...

555
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:07,718
...will look and feel so real to you,
you might be uneasy at first.

556
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:11,992
Just relax. After a while, I think
it will become pleasurable to you.

557
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,497
They tell me it feels something like 3-D.

558
00:39:20,672 --> 00:39:22,537
Any questions, Mr. Miller?

559
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:28,304
You may begin.

560
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:30,206
Thank you, Your Honors.

561
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:37,186
Over the following four days,
I will attempt to show that Daniel Miller...

562
00:39:37,722 --> 00:39:41,658
...while he is a quality human being,
is still held back...

563
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:44,293
...by the fears that have plagued him...

564
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:46,359
...lifetime after lifetime.

565
00:39:47,565 --> 00:39:51,057
I believe that I can show
without a shadow of a doubt...

566
00:39:51,235 --> 00:39:55,797
...that he must once again be returned
to Earth to work on this problem.

567
00:39:57,141 --> 00:39:59,735
May we begin in childhood, please?
Could we go to...

568
00:40:00,178 --> 00:40:01,941
...1 1-4-19?

569
00:40:02,714 --> 00:40:04,113
By the way...

570
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:08,476
...this signifies you're 1 1 years,
four months and 19 days old.

571
00:40:08,753 --> 00:40:10,812
-Is that clear?
-I think so.

572
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,947
In other words, if I said, 9-2-17...

573
00:40:14,025 --> 00:40:17,461
...you would be nine years,
two months and 17 days old.

574
00:40:17,729 --> 00:40:18,957
I understand.

575
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:41,244
Realistic, isn't it, Mr. Miller?

576
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:54,130
-Look what I found.
-Give me that.

577
00:40:54,198 --> 00:40:55,187
Make me.

578
00:40:55,833 --> 00:40:57,425
Why don't you make me?

579
00:40:57,702 --> 00:41:00,694
You can't make me
because I'll beat the shit out of you.

580
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:02,166
You couldn't.

581
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:06,336
Hit him, Daniel!

582
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:08,178
Come on!

583
00:41:08,713 --> 00:41:11,705
Chicken! Hit me right here.
Come on, chicken.

584
00:41:11,783 --> 00:41:13,774
Hit him, Daniel!

585
00:41:17,321 --> 00:41:20,256
Stick up for yourself, low-life chicken.

586
00:41:24,262 --> 00:41:26,526
That's too bad.

587
00:41:27,131 --> 00:41:31,329
Come over to my house later
and I'll help you glue it back together.

588
00:41:53,991 --> 00:41:57,654
What were you feeling as you watched
that episode?

589
00:41:58,763 --> 00:42:02,062
It felt strange to watch myself.
Is that what you mean?

590
00:42:02,166 --> 00:42:04,327
I mean emotionally.

591
00:42:04,635 --> 00:42:07,399
What kind of feelings did this bring up?

592
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:12,501
Frustration?

593
00:42:12,777 --> 00:42:16,679
It's not a test. There's no right answer.

594
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:18,675
Is that what you felt?

595
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,340
Frustration?

596
00:42:23,521 --> 00:42:24,510
I guess.

597
00:42:24,922 --> 00:42:26,856
Why were you afraid?

598
00:42:27,024 --> 00:42:28,184
I object.

599
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:32,295
How did we introduce the word "afraid"?
From frustration to "afraid"?

600
00:42:32,363 --> 00:42:34,422
This is already pronouncing him guilty.

601
00:42:34,632 --> 00:42:37,032
-Could we use another word?
-Which one?

602
00:42:37,235 --> 00:42:40,136
What word would I use?
How about "restraint"?

603
00:42:40,471 --> 00:42:42,598
I think the little boy was dignified.

604
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,134
"Restraint"?

605
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:46,434
May I show you what I mean?

606
00:42:47,211 --> 00:42:48,303
Be my guest.

607
00:42:49,313 --> 00:42:52,476
Your Honors, may we go to 1-8-17, please?

608
00:42:57,655 --> 00:43:01,557
What are you accusing me of?
Say it to my face!

609
00:43:01,726 --> 00:43:04,251
-What?
-You never think about my problems.

610
00:43:04,328 --> 00:43:06,296
-Lower your voice.
-Lower my voice?

611
00:43:06,397 --> 00:43:08,388
Don't yell in front of the baby.

612
00:43:08,466 --> 00:43:10,593
It's always the baby. What about me?

613
00:43:10,768 --> 00:43:14,204
I live here, too!
I work hard to pay for this house!

614
00:43:14,438 --> 00:43:18,169
-I know you do!
-The minute I earn it, you spend it!

615
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:20,310
You think I spend too much?

616
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:22,039
All I do is scrimp!

617
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,774
If you don't like it,
then why don't you leave?

618
00:43:24,982 --> 00:43:28,315
Stop it! This happens when you drink!

619
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:32,220
Lecture time!
Just sit down and join the lecture!

620
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:33,380
Don't touch me!

621
00:43:50,608 --> 00:43:55,102
In that brief moment,
when that baby and his father's eyes met...

622
00:43:55,279 --> 00:43:58,271
...this child learned the meaning
of restraint.

623
00:43:59,083 --> 00:44:02,246
He wasn't afraid. He was mature.

624
00:44:02,453 --> 00:44:05,286
He was non-violent. Dignified, I call it.

625
00:44:05,523 --> 00:44:08,788
My colleague may believe in
"Hit first, ask questions later"...

626
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:10,451
...but we're not all that way.

627
00:44:10,528 --> 00:44:11,392
I resent that.

628
00:44:13,631 --> 00:44:18,625
Let's ask Mr. Miller. In the schoolyard,
did you want to hit that child back?

629
00:44:20,571 --> 00:44:23,597
I wanted to hit him back,
but I felt restraint.

630
00:44:23,975 --> 00:44:25,943
You felt restraint. I see.

631
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:31,811
Is restraint always
the best course of action in every case?

632
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
No.

633
00:44:33,517 --> 00:44:36,953
Wouldn't this have been a case
to not restrain yourself?

634
00:44:38,055 --> 00:44:40,023
If you had stuck up for yourself...

635
00:44:40,091 --> 00:44:43,822
...this event would not have haunted you
all your life.

636
00:44:44,328 --> 00:44:46,421
You never forgot this.

637
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:48,122
You always thought about it.

638
00:44:48,199 --> 00:44:53,193
Hold on. People think about lots
of things throughout their entire life.

639
00:44:53,804 --> 00:44:55,635
You're isolating this incident?

640
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:59,802
Aren't we here to isolate incidents?
Or maybe I don't understand the job.

641
00:45:00,678 --> 00:45:03,579
Your Honors, to save valuable time...

642
00:45:03,647 --> 00:45:07,811
...l submit 1 1-4-19 as shown
without further comment.

643
00:45:09,787 --> 00:45:13,086
I'm fully satisfied. I love watching this kid.

644
00:45:13,791 --> 00:45:15,588
Anything you want to say?

645
00:45:16,527 --> 00:45:19,360
I feel very good about the "restraint" idea.

646
00:45:20,097 --> 00:45:21,291
Thank you.

647
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:24,593
You're up.

648
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:27,736
While we're still in childhood...

649
00:45:28,005 --> 00:45:31,702
...l'd like to show something
absolutely extraordinary.

650
00:45:31,976 --> 00:45:34,001
Could we go to 10-9-15, please?

651
00:45:44,188 --> 00:45:46,679
I'm on probation for stealing books.

652
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:50,316
They're going to think I stole this.
I'll be expelled.

653
00:45:50,394 --> 00:45:51,452
You won't.

654
00:45:51,896 --> 00:45:55,559
Of course, I will. I'm already in big trouble.

655
00:45:58,936 --> 00:46:00,369
Good afternoon.

656
00:46:04,075 --> 00:46:07,636
Continue working
on the assignment you began last Tuesday.

657
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:10,841
Take these.

658
00:46:11,649 --> 00:46:14,243
-I'll say I lost mine.
-You'll be in trouble.

659
00:46:14,418 --> 00:46:15,749
Just do it.

660
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:20,854
Where are your supplies?

661
00:46:21,158 --> 00:46:23,524
-I left them at home.
-Left them?

662
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:24,716
I lost them.

663
00:46:25,096 --> 00:46:27,257
Did you lose them or leave them?

664
00:46:27,765 --> 00:46:30,256
Both. I left them and lost them.

665
00:46:30,468 --> 00:46:34,495
Where are your supplies? Do you know
how much such these things cost?

666
00:46:34,772 --> 00:46:38,936
-Class, tell Daniel how much paint costs.
-$10.

667
00:46:39,110 --> 00:46:42,341
-And the brushes?
-$3.

668
00:46:42,413 --> 00:46:46,406
-What's the total?
-$13.

669
00:46:46,784 --> 00:46:49,116
You can't be an artist without paint.

670
00:46:49,253 --> 00:46:53,314
Like you can't swim unless you get
in the water. You must have paint.

671
00:46:54,291 --> 00:46:55,781
This is careless behavior.

672
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:58,620
I have to call your father today.

673
00:46:58,829 --> 00:47:00,990
Somehow, you must pay for this.

674
00:47:02,466 --> 00:47:03,296
Yeah.

675
00:47:11,142 --> 00:47:13,906
You got in quite a bit of trouble for that.

676
00:47:14,211 --> 00:47:17,408
But you felt your friend would have been
punished worse.

677
00:47:18,582 --> 00:47:23,417
At 10 years old, he showed
the kind of courage most adults never find.

678
00:47:25,222 --> 00:47:27,816
I let the life stand for itself here.

679
00:47:28,826 --> 00:47:32,819
Could we go to 10-9-15?
The evening of that same day.

680
00:47:38,769 --> 00:47:41,602
-How will you pay for this?
-I don't know!

681
00:47:41,739 --> 00:47:44,674
I'm very disappointed in you.

682
00:47:44,842 --> 00:47:45,809
I'm sorry.

683
00:47:46,010 --> 00:47:49,844
-We must punish you severely.
-We don't have to!

684
00:47:50,014 --> 00:47:53,745
Yes, we do.
First of all, no television for a month.

685
00:47:53,951 --> 00:47:57,250
I didn't do it! Steve did! It's Steve's fault!

686
00:47:57,755 --> 00:47:58,949
What?

687
00:47:59,190 --> 00:48:02,956
Steve lost the paints.
He probably stole them.

688
00:48:03,194 --> 00:48:05,025
I didn't do it.

689
00:48:07,531 --> 00:48:09,123
Punish him!

690
00:48:14,505 --> 00:48:18,498
What happened to your friend Steve?
Do you remember, Mr. Miller?

691
00:48:18,809 --> 00:48:19,867
What do you mean?

692
00:48:19,944 --> 00:48:24,108
He was expelled from school
two days later, isn't that right?

693
00:48:24,215 --> 00:48:25,773
I thought he left on his own.

694
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:27,041
What's the point?

695
00:48:27,151 --> 00:48:30,848
I'm looking at the results
of what you call a courageous act.

696
00:48:31,722 --> 00:48:34,657
Mr. Miller might have acted bravely
in class...

697
00:48:34,792 --> 00:48:38,785
...but we just watched him crumble
a few hours later, and why?

698
00:48:38,996 --> 00:48:40,725
At the threat of no television?

699
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:45,230
I was ten years old. Television is
everything to a ten-year-old.

700
00:48:45,703 --> 00:48:49,002
It's like heroin. You can't just pull it away.

701
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:50,707
I never wanted to watch.

702
00:48:50,908 --> 00:48:54,901
My parents made me because they wanted
to go out and I got hooked.

703
00:48:55,813 --> 00:48:59,078
Miss Foster and I
have had this argument before.

704
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:02,251
I think the act itself is what's important.

705
00:49:02,519 --> 00:49:06,421
She wants to keep enlarging it
until everything loses meaning.

706
00:49:06,824 --> 00:49:11,193
If I fixed a flat tire on your car and
two years later I lose your garden hose...

707
00:49:11,262 --> 00:49:13,730
...according to you,
I won't get credit for the flat.

708
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:15,731
I'm just the dummy who lost the hose.

709
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:18,525
Let me suggest this.

710
00:49:19,236 --> 00:49:23,536
Did we ever consider that
this boy had a bond with his father?

711
00:49:24,108 --> 00:49:26,440
It had nothing to do with his friend.

712
00:49:26,710 --> 00:49:30,840
I just think Daniel couldn't lie to his dad.
That's all.

713
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:35,444
You're nodding, Mr. Miller.
Does that mean you agree?

714
00:49:37,121 --> 00:49:41,558
I had a bond with my father.
I pretty much never lied to him.

715
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:43,625
You never lied to your father?

716
00:49:43,861 --> 00:49:47,058
Would you like to see
at least 500 examples?

717
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:52,262
I said, "pretty much."
I didn't say, "never, ever lied."

718
00:49:52,603 --> 00:49:54,230
You have to lie sometimes...

719
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,366
...in an emergency.

720
00:49:58,642 --> 00:50:00,906
It doesn't mean that the bond is affected.

721
00:50:00,978 --> 00:50:03,378
If you've got the bond,
the bond's always there.

722
00:50:03,447 --> 00:50:06,382
Even if you lie sometimes,
you won't interfere with it.

723
00:50:06,817 --> 00:50:10,810
You know, the bond can wait for a little lie.

724
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:13,319
In the end, it's there for you.

725
00:50:17,261 --> 00:50:19,661
Sometimes in the middle of a lie...

726
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:22,889
...l found that the bond would kick in.

727
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,894
Maybe squeeze a little truth out.

728
00:50:27,638 --> 00:50:28,570
Wrap it up.

729
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:31,001
I am through.

730
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,675
Very good day. I'm pleased.

731
00:50:34,912 --> 00:50:36,777
She's tough, isn't she?

732
00:50:36,914 --> 00:50:40,907
If I told you how tough,
you wouldn't sleep, believe me.

733
00:50:41,352 --> 00:50:44,287
Well, I'm off. You call me if you need me.

734
00:50:44,788 --> 00:50:46,915
You going out with that gal tonight?

735
00:50:47,124 --> 00:50:48,523
I can't. She's busy.

736
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:49,850
Busy?

737
00:50:50,527 --> 00:50:51,960
I'll be damned.

738
00:51:20,157 --> 00:51:22,148
-How are you?
-Fine. And you?

739
00:51:44,081 --> 00:51:45,571
Some sake.

740
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:50,581
How are you?

741
00:51:53,757 --> 00:51:55,418
-What's good?
-Everything.

742
00:51:55,592 --> 00:51:56,581
Everything.

743
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:59,358
What's this? It looks like a worm.

744
00:51:59,596 --> 00:52:00,927
Our resident food.

745
00:52:01,598 --> 00:52:02,690
How does it taste?

746
00:52:02,766 --> 00:52:03,926
You'd throw up.

747
00:52:04,234 --> 00:52:05,428
I'll have the tuna.

748
00:52:07,905 --> 00:52:09,270
Very good tuna.

749
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:11,271
Very fast.

750
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:12,873
So I've been told.

751
00:52:14,011 --> 00:52:15,444
Delicious!

752
00:52:15,712 --> 00:52:16,940
Like it?

753
00:52:17,114 --> 00:52:18,706
Thank you very much.

754
00:52:18,949 --> 00:52:20,507
How many days?

755
00:52:22,286 --> 00:52:24,277
How many days you looking at?

756
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:26,381
Nine.

757
00:52:27,291 --> 00:52:28,724
Nine days?

758
00:52:28,892 --> 00:52:31,122
Oh, my God! Nine days!

759
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:36,899
You better have more sake!

760
00:52:37,768 --> 00:52:39,292
9 days?

761
00:52:39,570 --> 00:52:41,037
I have 15.

762
00:52:41,738 --> 00:52:43,035
My name's Frank.

763
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:46,967
Fifteen days?

764
00:52:47,244 --> 00:52:49,041
-Is that a lot?
-I don't know.

765
00:52:50,814 --> 00:52:53,248
How'd you die, Dan? May I call you Dan?

766
00:52:53,484 --> 00:52:55,247
I got hit by a bus.

767
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,980
-And you?
-Got shot in the head.

768
00:52:59,423 --> 00:53:00,822
Really? Murder?

769
00:53:01,058 --> 00:53:05,051
Hunting accident.
Some putz thought I was an animal.

770
00:53:08,332 --> 00:53:10,493
-How'd you make a living?
-Advertising.

771
00:53:10,801 --> 00:53:13,326
-And you?
-Made a lot of money in adult books.

772
00:53:13,604 --> 00:53:14,798
Selling them?

773
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:18,668
No, reading them.
Yes, of course, selling them.

774
00:53:21,512 --> 00:53:22,945
Were you from LA?

775
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:27,582
-Know the night clubs by the airport?
-Those strip clubs?

776
00:53:28,852 --> 00:53:31,787
I coined the phrase, "All nude."

777
00:53:32,022 --> 00:53:34,286
-What do you mean?
-That was mine.

778
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:38,461
I bought two clubs.
They were only using the word "nude."

779
00:53:38,695 --> 00:53:41,687
I put up "Totally all nude."

780
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:46,367
Doubled business in a month.
I got to piss. You?

781
00:53:48,238 --> 00:53:50,035
Thank you very much.

782
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,176
I'm not leaving. I'm going to take a piss.

783
00:53:54,378 --> 00:53:56,039
Take a piss!

784
00:54:19,269 --> 00:54:21,237
-Hello.
-Mr. Miller?

785
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:24,237
I have a message for you.

786
00:54:24,508 --> 00:54:25,475
You do?

787
00:54:25,842 --> 00:54:27,070
Here it comes.

788
00:54:27,844 --> 00:54:30,244
Hi. Where are you?

789
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:36,085
I'm going to sleep.
Tomorrow, when you're done...

790
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:39,753
...meet me by the main entrance.
I'll be there.

791
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:42,651
I miss you. Isn't that funny?

792
00:54:43,594 --> 00:54:44,652
Good night.

793
00:54:55,405 --> 00:54:56,565
This is wild.

794
00:54:56,873 --> 00:55:01,435
Let me get this straight. You actually
had sex with Benjamin Franklin?

795
00:55:01,678 --> 00:55:03,111
Twice.

796
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:06,548
How was he?

797
00:55:06,783 --> 00:55:08,614
He was fat, Bob.

798
00:55:12,956 --> 00:55:14,685
I couldn't believe it.

799
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:17,791
It's wonderful. I'd forgot all about it.

800
00:55:18,061 --> 00:55:21,121
He was willing to sleep underwater.

801
00:55:21,465 --> 00:55:23,057
Marvelous.

802
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:24,462
Good morning.

803
00:55:25,669 --> 00:55:27,830
Good morning. I'm Dick Stanley.

804
00:55:28,238 --> 00:55:30,172
I'm going to defend you today.

805
00:55:30,641 --> 00:55:35,135
I'm going to defend you today.
Mr. Diamond couldn't make it.

806
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:37,471
He couldn't make it? You're kidding.

807
00:55:37,748 --> 00:55:39,306
He'll be back tomorrow.

808
00:55:39,549 --> 00:55:41,710
How can you? You don't know me.

809
00:55:41,818 --> 00:55:46,312
Mr. Miller, I use 51 percent of my brain.
I know everything about you.

810
00:55:46,490 --> 00:55:48,481
51 percent? That's clocked?

811
00:55:48,925 --> 00:55:49,653
Clocked.

812
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:50,750
Impressive.

813
00:55:50,927 --> 00:55:54,658
I'll lose. I can't start over again with you.

814
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:57,322
I operate differently than Diamond.

815
00:55:57,634 --> 00:56:00,967
Without tooting my own horn,
I'm quite good at this.

816
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:04,503
I'm familiar with your life
and I want you to trust me.

817
00:56:04,675 --> 00:56:05,642
I'll lose.

818
00:56:10,614 --> 00:56:13,879
Thank you so much. That was so nice.

819
00:56:14,017 --> 00:56:15,245
It was nothing.

820
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:22,022
Good morning. Your Honor,
my defender is not here this morning.

821
00:56:22,192 --> 00:56:26,128
Under the circumstances,
this puts me at a disadvantage.

822
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:29,696
It's quite common.
Mr. Stanley will do fine. Begin.

823
00:56:34,471 --> 00:56:39,272
Today I would like to begin
with an episode in the 24th year of life.

824
00:56:40,277 --> 00:56:44,976
Mr. Miller had been out of school
and working for several years...

825
00:56:45,215 --> 00:56:47,376
...and he had put aside $10,000...

826
00:56:47,651 --> 00:56:49,881
...specifically to invest.

827
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:52,383
Do you remember?

828
00:56:52,889 --> 00:56:55,653
One of Mr. Miller's good friends
from school...

829
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:59,489
...was the son of an executive
of the Casio Corporation...

830
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:03,666
...which at that time
was not doing particularly well.

831
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:06,894
Mr. Miller had dinner with this friend...

832
00:57:07,104 --> 00:57:09,902
...at which he was given information...

833
00:57:10,173 --> 00:57:13,574
...which comes along maybe once
every five or six lifetimes.

834
00:57:14,411 --> 00:57:17,005
May we go to 24-2-16, please?

835
00:57:21,318 --> 00:57:24,810
They're gearing up now.
They'll start production in three months.

836
00:57:25,088 --> 00:57:28,421
-Buy as much stock as you can.
-This is fantastic.

837
00:57:28,592 --> 00:57:32,688
Switzerland keeps the time, Charles,
not Japan.

838
00:57:32,929 --> 00:57:34,521
-It'll change.
-I doubt it.

839
00:57:34,598 --> 00:57:35,826
Why not?

840
00:57:36,032 --> 00:57:39,263
Because you need a society
that is into precision.

841
00:57:39,569 --> 00:57:44,006
Japan makes great radios,
but they don't know beans about precision.

842
00:57:45,442 --> 00:57:50,038
You come here and tell me the Germans
are going to start making watches...

843
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,340
...and I'll invest.

844
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:53,777
What's the present value?

845
00:57:54,017 --> 00:57:55,780
-Six.
-Here's my prediction.

846
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:59,447
When word hits the street, you're at three.

847
00:58:00,223 --> 00:58:02,555
You watch. Remember who said it.

848
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:10,227
For the record...

849
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,269
...Casio is one of the largest producers
of time pieces in the universe.

850
00:58:16,573 --> 00:58:18,040
I know who they are.

851
00:58:19,476 --> 00:58:23,139
For the record,
his original investment of $10,000...

852
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:26,645
...would be worth $37.2 million today.

853
00:58:26,883 --> 00:58:27,872
Wow!

854
00:58:30,487 --> 00:58:32,648
I have nothing further to say.

855
00:58:34,391 --> 00:58:35,323
I'm fine.

856
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:37,124
You're what?

857
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:38,951
He's not going to reply.

858
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:41,388
You aren't responding?

859
00:58:41,598 --> 00:58:44,192
I'd like to hear you speak.

860
00:58:44,634 --> 00:58:46,329
You are good.

861
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:51,231
Listen, I'm not as smart as everyone here.

862
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:55,339
Am I defective because
I didn't make money on this?

863
00:58:55,612 --> 00:58:59,844
I can't believe that the whole point
of the universe is to make money.

864
00:59:00,016 --> 00:59:01,347
I can't believe that.

865
00:59:01,618 --> 00:59:03,916
This has nothing to do with making money.

866
00:59:04,187 --> 00:59:06,417
It's a judgment you made.

867
00:59:06,690 --> 00:59:10,649
Nobody dragged you from home,
saying: "You have to invest $10,000."

868
00:59:10,727 --> 00:59:13,423
You chose to do that.
You sought the investment.

869
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:15,589
We're just looking at that choice.

870
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:19,197
What did you finally invest in?
Do you remember?

871
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:22,996
I think it was cattle.

872
00:59:24,140 --> 00:59:25,300
Cattle.

873
00:59:26,543 --> 00:59:27,874
What happened?

874
00:59:29,446 --> 00:59:34,042
I never got a straight answer.
All I know is, their teeth fell out.

875
00:59:38,221 --> 00:59:39,210
I rest.

876
00:59:39,656 --> 00:59:41,214
Mr. Stanley, you're up.

877
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:43,219
No counter at this time.

878
00:59:43,627 --> 00:59:45,390
Wait a second.

879
00:59:45,495 --> 00:59:47,622
You're not showing something in my favor?

880
00:59:47,731 --> 00:59:50,666
Not at this time.
I think it's better to move on.

881
00:59:51,268 --> 00:59:54,499
-Shall we move on?
-Sure, let's move on.

882
00:59:55,338 --> 00:59:58,569
Your Honors, I would like to go to 29-4-5.

883
00:59:58,842 --> 01:00:02,243
This is the evening
before Mr. Miller took the advertising job...

884
01:00:02,412 --> 01:00:04,744
...he was to hold until his passing.

885
01:00:05,115 --> 01:00:08,312
He asked his wife to help him
by playing a little game.

886
01:00:08,385 --> 01:00:11,718
Remember?
You asked her to act the boss...

887
01:00:11,922 --> 01:00:14,356
...so you could practice
getting what you wanted.

888
01:00:18,194 --> 01:00:20,685
-Do this for me. It helps.
-I'm eating.

889
01:00:20,864 --> 01:00:21,990
Do it.

890
01:00:22,499 --> 01:00:24,490
-What do you want me to do?
-Be him.

891
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:27,262
-This is silly.
-It's not. It helps me.

892
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,895
Offer me $55,000. No more.

893
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:33,102
-How much do you want?
-What's the offer?

894
01:00:33,176 --> 01:00:34,803
$55,000.

895
01:00:34,878 --> 01:00:37,438
I can't work here for less than $65,000.

896
01:00:37,714 --> 01:00:39,375
I can't pay you $65,000.

897
01:00:39,482 --> 01:00:40,813
Then I can't work here.

898
01:00:41,451 --> 01:00:42,509
$58,000.

899
01:00:42,719 --> 01:00:43,447
$65,000.

900
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,450
$59,000.

901
01:00:44,621 --> 01:00:45,679
$65,000.

902
01:00:45,755 --> 01:00:48,246
-$60,000?
-$65,000.

903
01:00:48,625 --> 01:00:49,614
$61,000.

904
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,222
Listen.

905
01:00:51,294 --> 01:00:56,061
I cannot take the job for under $65,000,
under no conditions.

906
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,996
I would like to go to the next afternoon
and show you the real encounter.

907
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,801
-I'm prepared to offer you $49,000.
-I'll take it.

908
01:01:09,913 --> 01:01:11,813
I'll get you a parking place.

909
01:01:24,694 --> 01:01:27,356
I'm curious why you caved in so fast.

910
01:01:28,498 --> 01:01:32,332
Why did you accept less money
and do it so quickly?

911
01:01:32,669 --> 01:01:36,696
Here we go again.
Obviously, this is all about money.

912
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:39,942
I'm guilty.
I didn't make enough money, okay?

913
01:01:40,076 --> 01:01:42,374
Call me a "hippie," send me to hell.

914
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:45,937
You keep thinking it's about money,
but it's about fear.

915
01:01:47,717 --> 01:01:51,710
Why didn't you stand up to your boss
the way you did to your wife?

916
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:55,357
First, it wasn't my wife.
It was a man in a suit.

917
01:01:55,492 --> 01:01:59,724
The suit had an odor
and the odor said $49,000.

918
01:02:00,063 --> 01:02:02,122
I like that very much.

919
01:02:03,933 --> 01:02:07,528
Your nostrils said you were worth less,
is that right?

920
01:02:07,971 --> 01:02:12,408
The process of accepting a salary
is a complicated one.

921
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:14,568
You don't know all my reasons.

922
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:17,845
We lived fine on that money.
That money was fine.

923
01:02:17,914 --> 01:02:22,010
If you want to make it about money,
you may. But we're looking at fear.

924
01:02:22,085 --> 01:02:24,212
-What was I afraid of?
-You tell me!

925
01:02:24,287 --> 01:02:26,255
$49,000 is a lot of money!

926
01:02:29,659 --> 01:02:31,991
I have nothing more to say.

927
01:02:33,029 --> 01:02:34,018
Mr. Stanley?

928
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:35,253
I'm fine.

929
01:02:35,765 --> 01:02:37,198
I can't believe it.

930
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:39,391
You didn't want to toot your own horn.

931
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:41,399
Would you like to show something?

932
01:02:41,871 --> 01:02:43,930
I got a raise six months later.

933
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:45,735
Let us know if you want to show us.

934
01:02:47,644 --> 01:02:52,308
Your Honors, I'd like to present
a compilation of general misjudgments...

935
01:02:52,549 --> 01:02:55,347
...half of them fear-based, half just stupid.

936
01:02:56,286 --> 01:03:00,518
I have assembled 164 misjudgments
over a 12-year period.

937
01:03:23,246 --> 01:03:24,838
Congratulations.

938
01:04:07,157 --> 01:04:11,821
This is so wonderful.
I am looking forward to tomorrow.

939
01:04:13,630 --> 01:04:15,291
I missed you.

940
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:16,758
Meet Sam.

941
01:04:18,001 --> 01:04:20,162
-Julia told me about you.
-Really?

942
01:04:20,336 --> 01:04:21,496
She doesn't know me.

943
01:04:22,138 --> 01:04:25,437
She could have fooled me.
I heard you had Dick Stanley today.

944
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:26,497
How'd you know?

945
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:28,770
Sam uses 54 percent of his brain.

946
01:04:30,246 --> 01:04:33,340
Stanley is a good man.
Quiet, but excellent.

947
01:04:33,650 --> 01:04:34,810
Very quiet.

948
01:04:36,152 --> 01:04:38,052
Julia, see you tomorrow.

949
01:04:38,588 --> 01:04:39,612
Thank you.

950
01:04:44,661 --> 01:04:48,927
We have to go to the Past Lives Pavilion.
Everybody talks about it.

951
01:04:49,566 --> 01:04:52,558
-Don't you want to see who you were?
-Some people don't like it.

952
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:55,001
You'll love it. They have great hot dogs.

953
01:04:55,805 --> 01:04:58,968
The best hot dogs in town
are by the Hall of Records.

954
01:04:59,042 --> 01:05:00,942
You sure love this eating thing.

955
01:05:01,311 --> 01:05:05,975
To be able to eat all you want,
never gain weight and feel great. Please.

956
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:20,322
Look at this!

957
01:05:24,601 --> 01:05:26,228
Let's get in line.

958
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:35,974
Reminds me of Disneyland.

959
01:05:36,446 --> 01:05:38,107
Hope we're tall enough.

960
01:05:39,716 --> 01:05:43,208
On Earth, did you ever feel like
you might have been other people?

961
01:05:43,286 --> 01:05:47,552
-Ever see yourself in a past life?
-Never. You did?

962
01:05:47,624 --> 01:05:51,287
I think so. I think I might have been
a heavyset man once.

963
01:05:51,461 --> 01:05:53,793
Really? I doubt that.

964
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:55,961
You never saw yourself as anything?

965
01:05:56,032 --> 01:05:59,866
Once I got stoned
and stared into a mirror for two hours...

966
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:02,369
...until I saw someone who looked Chinese.

967
01:06:02,772 --> 01:06:04,899
But I think it was just me squinting.

968
01:06:13,383 --> 01:06:16,819
Please take the first available booth
on the left.

969
01:06:16,886 --> 01:06:19,616
The show will begin in 30 seconds.

970
01:06:32,802 --> 01:06:35,737
Welcome to the Past Lives Pavilion.

971
01:06:37,173 --> 01:06:42,110
In a moment, you will be asked to place
your right hand on the plate next to you.

972
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:47,041
An image of yourself in a former life
will soon appear.

973
01:06:47,583 --> 01:06:51,417
When you have seen enough,
take your hand off the plate.

974
01:06:51,988 --> 01:06:54,923
In order to accommodate everyone...

975
01:06:55,058 --> 01:06:56,491
...you will be limited...

976
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,424
...to five past lives only.

977
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:00,320
Thank you.

978
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:05,262
Place hand on plate.

979
01:07:18,147 --> 01:07:19,546
What the hell is this?

980
01:07:20,049 --> 01:07:23,143
Elizabeth! Time for supper, darling.

981
01:07:23,219 --> 01:07:25,312
Be there in a moment, Mumsy.

982
01:07:25,722 --> 01:07:27,451
What the hell's going on here?

983
01:07:50,947 --> 01:07:53,279
Come on, then! To the castle!

984
01:07:57,920 --> 01:07:59,581
That's incredible!

985
01:08:00,056 --> 01:08:01,045
Who are you?

986
01:08:01,124 --> 01:08:02,955
I'm Prince Valiant!

987
01:08:03,226 --> 01:08:04,386
Really?

988
01:08:06,028 --> 01:08:07,962
-Who are you?
-Dinner.

989
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:19,365
I was a prince, I was a whaler,
I was a tailor!

990
01:08:19,575 --> 01:08:22,043
God. It was so incredible!

991
01:08:22,445 --> 01:08:23,673
You were a native?

992
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:25,713
And a dressmaker. That's all I saw.

993
01:08:25,782 --> 01:08:30,515
That's so weird. You were a dressmaker,
I was a tailor. Interesting. Want some?

994
01:08:33,523 --> 01:08:35,354
You're going to eat the stick, too?

995
01:08:38,294 --> 01:08:40,626
I can't get you out of my mind.

996
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:43,059
Tell me about it.

997
01:08:43,499 --> 01:08:45,330
The screenings are so tough...

998
01:08:45,501 --> 01:08:49,096
...but when I see you, I instantly feel okay.

999
01:08:50,006 --> 01:08:51,564
That's great, right?

1000
01:08:51,841 --> 01:08:54,867
I don't think it has anything to do with me.
It worries me.

1001
01:08:54,944 --> 01:08:56,172
You're doing it.

1002
01:08:56,245 --> 01:08:58,145
What? What am I doing?

1003
01:08:58,214 --> 01:08:59,613
I'm not sure.

1004
01:08:59,882 --> 01:09:02,817
But I read that you had to be okay
with yourself...

1005
01:09:02,952 --> 01:09:05,443
...before you were okay
with another person.

1006
01:09:05,688 --> 01:09:07,349
I feel okay with you.

1007
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:10,888
But I don't know how okay I was
with myself before I met you.

1008
01:09:11,194 --> 01:09:13,685
So maybe you're making me okay.

1009
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,091
You're not that okay.

1010
01:09:16,899 --> 01:09:18,332
I'm okay.

1011
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:26,007
What's the score?

1012
01:09:27,443 --> 01:09:28,910
You're losing.

1013
01:09:29,545 --> 01:09:30,876
We're tied.

1014
01:09:31,848 --> 01:09:33,008
Beauty.

1015
01:09:34,550 --> 01:09:38,145
You know,
you never told me how you died.

1016
01:09:39,255 --> 01:09:41,189
I don't want to talk about it.

1017
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:42,680
Why?

1018
01:09:44,227 --> 01:09:45,888
It's embarrassing.

1019
01:09:46,562 --> 01:09:49,395
What could be embarrassing?
I was hit by a bus.

1020
01:09:50,566 --> 01:09:51,897
I tripped.

1021
01:09:54,136 --> 01:09:56,070
Seriously? You tripped?

1022
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:57,365
On what?

1023
01:09:58,274 --> 01:10:00,435
We were visiting friends for the weekend.

1024
01:10:00,843 --> 01:10:02,674
Everybody wanted to go into town...

1025
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:06,203
...but I wanted to stay and go swimming.
So I went outside...

1026
01:10:06,282 --> 01:10:10,275
...tripped over the chair, hit my head
on the cement and rolled into the pool.

1027
01:10:10,887 --> 01:10:13,447
What did the East German judge give you?

1028
01:10:14,056 --> 01:10:18,083
Seriously, did you feel anything?
Were you unconscious? Scared?

1029
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:19,720
I was pissed.

1030
01:10:20,162 --> 01:10:21,459
You died pissed.

1031
01:10:21,531 --> 01:10:23,328
I'm still pissed. I was a good swimmer.

1032
01:10:23,599 --> 01:10:26,762
Swimming is only part of it.
You must negotiate the furniture.

1033
01:10:27,436 --> 01:10:30,633
In the Olympics,
they're taking that part very seriously.

1034
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:32,797
The Romanians are great at it.

1035
01:10:32,942 --> 01:10:35,467
If you make fun of me, I'll get you.

1036
01:10:35,545 --> 01:10:37,376
You've already got me.

1037
01:10:43,319 --> 01:10:45,879
-What time do you start?
-Early.

1038
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:47,786
I start at 3:00.

1039
01:10:48,591 --> 01:10:50,422
Want to have dinner tomorrow?

1040
01:10:50,893 --> 01:10:53,555
I thought I'd start dating others now.

1041
01:10:54,096 --> 01:10:56,656
I have my eye on this 91-year-old.

1042
01:10:58,401 --> 01:11:00,460
I'll be at the entrance at 5:00.

1043
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:02,767
I'll be there.

1044
01:11:03,172 --> 01:11:07,768
If you finish early, come
to my screening room and see my life.

1045
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:09,272
I'd like that.

1046
01:11:13,816 --> 01:11:15,977
-Good night.
-Good night.

1047
01:11:46,215 --> 01:11:47,807
You'll sleep great.

1048
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:50,875
I have three boxes of candy waiting for me.

1049
01:11:51,988 --> 01:11:55,321
Did they give you those chocolate swans?

1050
01:11:58,494 --> 01:12:01,827
They're cream-filled.
They're really delicious.

1051
01:12:02,498 --> 01:12:03,487
Swans.

1052
01:12:06,769 --> 01:12:09,067
I think I'm just getting breath mints.

1053
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,742
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

1054
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:52,212
After you.

1055
01:12:52,515 --> 01:12:53,504
Thank you.

1056
01:12:58,854 --> 01:13:00,685
Now I have no attorney.

1057
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:06,860
That's a very, very nice outfit.

1058
01:13:13,002 --> 01:13:14,162
Do you like it here?

1059
01:13:15,538 --> 01:13:17,506
I'll make you a promise.

1060
01:13:17,807 --> 01:13:21,743
When we're through, if you still want
to know about me, I'll tell you.

1061
01:13:21,811 --> 01:13:25,008
But right now, let's concentrate on you.

1062
01:13:28,050 --> 01:13:31,713
-Well, look who's here.
-Good morning. I missed you.

1063
01:13:31,921 --> 01:13:33,980
-How are you, buddy?
-What do you care?

1064
01:13:34,223 --> 01:13:37,556
Stop it.
You think I let you down, don't you?

1065
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:40,421
Where were you? I'm just curious.

1066
01:13:40,529 --> 01:13:42,087
You wouldn't understand.

1067
01:13:42,298 --> 01:13:44,459
Don't treat me like a moron. Try me.

1068
01:13:45,634 --> 01:13:48,159
I was trapped
near the inner circle of thought.

1069
01:13:48,904 --> 01:13:50,872
-I don't understand.
-I told you.

1070
01:13:56,312 --> 01:13:57,870
Hi. How are you?

1071
01:13:58,147 --> 01:13:59,546
Good morning, everybody.

1072
01:13:59,949 --> 01:14:02,042
Let's begin. Miss Foster, you're up.

1073
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:04,508
Thank you, Your Honors.

1074
01:14:05,721 --> 01:14:07,086
This morning...

1075
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:11,253
...l would like to begin
in the 34th year of life.

1076
01:14:11,694 --> 01:14:14,094
Mr. Miller had a speaking engagement...

1077
01:14:14,163 --> 01:14:17,599
...to represent all of the West Coast
advertising agencies.

1078
01:14:17,733 --> 01:14:21,567
He was to give a very important speech
to the Ford Motor Company.

1079
01:14:21,771 --> 01:14:26,606
If he did well, it could have worked
wonders for his career.

1080
01:14:26,776 --> 01:14:28,710
Don't make this the end of the world.

1081
01:14:29,245 --> 01:14:31,941
May we go to 34-7-7, please?

1082
01:14:37,586 --> 01:14:40,919
It's packed like sardines. You ready?

1083
01:14:41,657 --> 01:14:45,991
I can't do it. There are too many people.
I can't go out there.

1084
01:14:46,395 --> 01:14:47,726
You've got to.

1085
01:14:48,030 --> 01:14:51,193
Something has happened to me.
This is way too many people.

1086
01:14:51,267 --> 01:14:53,667
I'm having horrible stage fright.

1087
01:14:54,203 --> 01:14:57,001
You got to. People are counting on you.

1088
01:14:57,273 --> 01:14:59,503
-I'll make a fool of myself.
-No, you're not.

1089
01:14:59,575 --> 01:15:02,908
I can't do it. My heart is racing.

1090
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:06,545
I am having some sort of an anxiety attack.

1091
01:15:06,649 --> 01:15:08,241
You know this stuff.

1092
01:15:08,317 --> 01:15:12,014
I can't think straight.
Listen to me, that's too many people.

1093
01:15:12,188 --> 01:15:15,749
I don't want to go out there.
You have to cancel this.

1094
01:15:16,392 --> 01:15:17,359
You're on.

1095
01:15:18,427 --> 01:15:20,987
Give us a second.

1096
01:15:21,163 --> 01:15:23,825
You've got a full house.
It's packed. Let's go!

1097
01:15:25,201 --> 01:15:28,170
-You'll be fine.
-Don't make me do this.

1098
01:15:29,805 --> 01:15:34,640
Please welcome our speaker
from Foote, Cone & Belding, Daniel Miller.

1099
01:15:36,245 --> 01:15:38,304
I'll be right here if you need me.

1100
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:06,705
Your attention, please.

1101
01:16:06,909 --> 01:16:09,878
Nothing serious.
We have a gas leak under this room.

1102
01:16:09,979 --> 01:16:12,504
We'd like you all to file out.

1103
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:15,650
Be orderly. This is only a precaution.

1104
01:16:31,634 --> 01:16:36,333
I would have shown this day
to illustrate just how brave Mr. Miller is.

1105
01:16:36,438 --> 01:16:39,896
With all the pain,
panic and confusion in his mind...

1106
01:16:40,309 --> 01:16:42,539
...he still walked to the microphone.

1107
01:16:42,611 --> 01:16:44,374
He never said anything!

1108
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,341
There was a gas leak!

1109
01:16:46,715 --> 01:16:49,582
But he never went back
and accomplished it.

1110
01:16:49,652 --> 01:16:53,088
He never got up in front
of a large audience again.

1111
01:16:53,555 --> 01:16:55,182
Maybe he didn't want to.

1112
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:58,920
Mr. Miller accepted that engagement
with a great deal of excitement.

1113
01:16:59,495 --> 01:17:01,486
He wanted to be there.

1114
01:17:02,131 --> 01:17:04,622
If he had accomplished that moment...

1115
01:17:04,733 --> 01:17:09,193
...l'm positive his life would have gone
in a much better direction.

1116
01:17:09,672 --> 01:17:12,232
You're positive! She's wonderful!

1117
01:17:12,408 --> 01:17:15,502
"His life would have gone in a much
better direction."

1118
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:17,873
Just incredible!

1119
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:25,814
I'd like to move on to something
I think we'll have a ball watching.

1120
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:28,420
This is damned exciting stuff.

1121
01:17:28,791 --> 01:17:31,487
Daniel, where did this scene take place?

1122
01:17:32,227 --> 01:17:33,455
What are you showing?

1123
01:17:33,729 --> 01:17:37,995
I'm sorry. We're going down to 31-1-9.
The snowmobile.

1124
01:17:39,969 --> 01:17:41,095
Big Bear.

1125
01:17:41,637 --> 01:17:43,468
Big Bear.

1126
01:17:44,907 --> 01:17:46,670
Watch this, Your Honors.

1127
01:17:46,942 --> 01:17:48,603
Just dynamite.

1128
01:17:56,485 --> 01:17:59,977
"Where the buffalo roam

1129
01:18:05,527 --> 01:18:09,429
"And the skies are all cloudy all--"

1130
01:18:11,734 --> 01:18:13,292
Oh, my God!

1131
01:18:37,526 --> 01:18:39,460
How far did you have to go for help?

1132
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:41,329
About three miles.

1133
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:43,194
You broke your leg in two places?

1134
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:45,290
-Yes, I did.
-I'm proud of you.

1135
01:18:56,578 --> 01:19:01,242
With no help, by himself, with as badly
a broken leg as I've ever seen...

1136
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:04,183
...this man crawled three miles to get help.

1137
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:05,578
You're kidding.

1138
01:19:06,422 --> 01:19:08,083
What have we just watched?

1139
01:19:08,524 --> 01:19:13,018
That is self-preservation.
He didn't risk his life, he saved his life.

1140
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:15,460
You're not a hero if you save your own life?

1141
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:18,193
A hero? No, you're not.

1142
01:19:19,134 --> 01:19:23,230
No one here is accusing Mr. Miller
of not having a survival instinct.

1143
01:19:23,472 --> 01:19:27,909
We're here to see if he can overcome fear,
not pain.

1144
01:19:27,976 --> 01:19:29,568
You don't see fear in this?

1145
01:19:29,678 --> 01:19:30,667
Fear of what?

1146
01:19:30,746 --> 01:19:32,646
How about death for starters?

1147
01:19:33,082 --> 01:19:37,883
I hope you realize it would be very hard
to be a brilliant public speaker...

1148
01:19:37,953 --> 01:19:39,818
...if you're lying dead in the snow.

1149
01:19:39,988 --> 01:19:41,546
For the record...

1150
01:19:41,924 --> 01:19:44,154
...you never rode a snowmobile again.

1151
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:48,453
Hold on. Not because I was afraid.
Because I hated it.

1152
01:19:49,965 --> 01:19:51,432
You must believe me.

1153
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:53,967
This is not about fear. This is hate.

1154
01:19:54,269 --> 01:19:56,703
This is a rotten contraption.

1155
01:19:57,139 --> 01:19:59,403
It heats up like a toaster oven.

1156
01:19:59,475 --> 01:20:02,569
I burned the hair off my thigh
from my knee to my crotch!

1157
01:20:02,911 --> 01:20:05,311
Singed it right off. I don't know...

1158
01:20:05,547 --> 01:20:08,607
...if the seat was leather or lined with fur...

1159
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:12,512
...but years of rotting,
drying out and getting wet....

1160
01:20:12,654 --> 01:20:14,645
Mine smelled like an old sheepdog.

1161
01:20:15,390 --> 01:20:17,881
Also, it's very, very noisy.

1162
01:20:18,193 --> 01:20:23,028
You don't find that out until the
second hour when you can't hear anyone.

1163
01:20:23,265 --> 01:20:26,496
You get off and your friends
are in a silent movie.

1164
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:33,973
Pardon me, but your balls vibrate
for three weeks afterwards.

1165
01:20:40,015 --> 01:20:44,679
I'm very proud of you. Very good day.
Very emotional day.

1166
01:20:45,521 --> 01:20:48,183
-What are you doing tonight?
-I'm seeing this woman.

1167
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:50,450
-Julia?
-How'd you know her name?

1168
01:20:50,726 --> 01:20:52,694
Still don't get the big brain bit?

1169
01:20:52,761 --> 01:20:57,095
I'll see you tomorrow.
You did very well. See you.

1170
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:33,058
Here it comes again.

1171
01:21:37,372 --> 01:21:38,430
Look at her go!

1172
01:21:46,348 --> 01:21:48,782
Going back for the cat is wonderful.

1173
01:21:49,051 --> 01:21:50,541
What kind of cat was it?

1174
01:21:51,019 --> 01:21:52,008
Persian.

1175
01:21:52,654 --> 01:21:54,144
I love Persian.

1176
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:05,365
Sorry, but I just had to see it again.

1177
01:22:05,734 --> 01:22:07,929
That's all right. It was spectacular.

1178
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:13,968
That's all for now. We'll meet once more.

1179
01:22:14,776 --> 01:22:16,334
For enjoyment's sake.

1180
01:22:16,645 --> 01:22:18,203
Let's make it at 1 :00.

1181
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,447
Daniel, nice to see you. How are you?

1182
01:22:30,225 --> 01:22:32,216
You have a good time tonight.

1183
01:22:32,661 --> 01:22:34,458
I'll see you tomorrow at 1 :00.

1184
01:22:35,597 --> 01:22:39,260
Sam told me
about an amazing ltalian restaurant.

1185
01:22:39,568 --> 01:22:43,937
Exciting. It was like watching
a Mutual of Omaha commercial.

1186
01:22:44,539 --> 01:22:45,528
You're jealous.

1187
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:48,841
You'll never know how much.

1188
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:03,016
-Those portions are gigantic!
-I'm so hungry.

1189
01:23:03,091 --> 01:23:07,255
The residents love this place.
It has the best resident food in the area.

1190
01:23:07,329 --> 01:23:08,819
Good clumps?

1191
01:23:09,398 --> 01:23:10,729
Enjoy your meal.

1192
01:23:13,335 --> 01:23:15,428
What was your favorite food?

1193
01:23:15,871 --> 01:23:17,805
Turkey with stuffing.

1194
01:23:18,573 --> 01:23:20,507
-I couldn't eat turkey.
-Why not?

1195
01:23:20,575 --> 01:23:23,669
When I was a kid,
I had one as a pet and I named it.

1196
01:23:24,079 --> 01:23:25,842
You can't eat something you name.

1197
01:23:25,914 --> 01:23:29,247
I wish I'd known that.
I would have named ice cream.

1198
01:23:30,585 --> 01:23:31,677
Do you eat meat?

1199
01:23:31,753 --> 01:23:34,085
Sometimes. How about you?

1200
01:23:34,256 --> 01:23:37,123
-I like fish.
-Me, too. What kind?

1201
01:23:37,592 --> 01:23:38,820
Salmon.

1202
01:23:39,027 --> 01:23:42,929
And I like the kind that live
near the nuclear reactors.

1203
01:23:43,198 --> 01:23:45,666
-I forget their name.
-Glow fish?

1204
01:23:45,767 --> 01:23:48,167
They light up your house
when you cook them.

1205
01:23:48,337 --> 01:23:52,501
-How was your screening?
-Very, very good.

1206
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:55,042
Some fine wine for yourselves?

1207
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:57,441
-What's your name?
-Eduardo.

1208
01:23:57,846 --> 01:23:59,507
-How are you, sir?
-I'm fine.

1209
01:23:59,748 --> 01:24:02,717
You're going to eat a lot with us tonight?

1210
01:24:02,784 --> 01:24:04,274
What do you recommend?

1211
01:24:04,553 --> 01:24:06,043
You like pasta?

1212
01:24:06,288 --> 01:24:08,279
I'll bring you three pounds of it.

1213
01:24:08,490 --> 01:24:09,889
Best you've ever tasted.

1214
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:14,122
You'll love it. What about you,
my friend? Do you like shrimp?

1215
01:24:15,797 --> 01:24:19,790
They're so fresh, they'll crawl up
onto the plate themselves.

1216
01:24:20,535 --> 01:24:22,162
Aren't they high in cholesterol?

1217
01:24:22,838 --> 01:24:26,569
I don't know what you're talking about,
but don't worry.

1218
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:28,504
I'll be right back.

1219
01:24:37,652 --> 01:24:39,381
Is there a Jacuzzi in your room?

1220
01:24:40,922 --> 01:24:41,889
In yours?

1221
01:24:42,691 --> 01:24:44,352
Not in my room.

1222
01:24:45,961 --> 01:24:47,588
It's in the bathroom.

1223
01:24:48,397 --> 01:24:52,731
It may not even be a Jacuzzi.
I think it's just holes in the tub.

1224
01:24:53,068 --> 01:24:57,402
You don't have to protect my feelings.
If you have a Jacuzzi, I'm happy.

1225
01:24:57,639 --> 01:25:02,303
Okay, I do. I use it every night.
It's just wonderful.

1226
01:25:03,612 --> 01:25:05,204
I'm happy for you.

1227
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,872
-I love it.
-A lot of bubbles?

1228
01:25:08,049 --> 01:25:11,177
Here we are. You're going to love this.

1229
01:25:14,389 --> 01:25:16,357
And you will love this.

1230
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:19,293
There's 30 shrimp...

1231
01:25:19,361 --> 01:25:21,591
...and 30 more where that came from.

1232
01:25:22,197 --> 01:25:23,926
This looks delicious.

1233
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:24,988
Broccoli?

1234
01:25:26,868 --> 01:25:28,028
With lots of cheese?

1235
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:33,140
That's my girl. What about you?

1236
01:25:33,842 --> 01:25:35,571
Maybe just a touch.

1237
01:25:35,644 --> 01:25:36,668
You got it.

1238
01:25:38,079 --> 01:25:39,103
That's fine.

1239
01:25:39,815 --> 01:25:41,578
How many days you looking at?

1240
01:25:41,817 --> 01:25:42,579
Nine.

1241
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:47,177
You like pie?

1242
01:25:47,456 --> 01:25:48,514
I love pie.

1243
01:25:48,824 --> 01:25:50,018
I like you.

1244
01:25:50,325 --> 01:25:54,762
I'll bring you nine pies to take with you.
A pie for every day.

1245
01:25:55,063 --> 01:25:57,224
I don't want any pies.

1246
01:25:57,466 --> 01:26:00,128
It's my pleasure. They'll keep.

1247
01:26:01,903 --> 01:26:03,234
Don't. Really.

1248
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:06,173
Don't bring me anything.

1249
01:26:12,147 --> 01:26:13,978
Oh, my God!

1250
01:26:19,554 --> 01:26:20,543
Oh, my God.

1251
01:26:20,856 --> 01:26:22,016
It's unbelievable.

1252
01:26:22,324 --> 01:26:24,315
My prosecutor just sat down.

1253
01:26:24,559 --> 01:26:26,550
Look. Don't look!

1254
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:28,156
I can't eat here.

1255
01:26:28,296 --> 01:26:30,730
What? You're just eating dinner.

1256
01:26:30,799 --> 01:26:32,892
I'm eating 30 shrimp. I'm a pig.

1257
01:26:33,869 --> 01:26:35,359
Everyone eats like that here.

1258
01:26:35,470 --> 01:26:37,700
Yes, but everyone doesn't have
her watching.

1259
01:26:37,873 --> 01:26:41,206
She'll have a tiny resident portion
and I'm eating a fishing boat.

1260
01:26:45,947 --> 01:26:47,278
Let's leave.

1261
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:49,848
You're silly. You're just eating.

1262
01:26:50,852 --> 01:26:51,944
You're right.

1263
01:26:56,591 --> 01:26:57,751
When will that end?

1264
01:26:59,761 --> 01:27:02,195
We're having fun. That's important.

1265
01:27:02,631 --> 01:27:05,623
See? This woman's looking at that.

1266
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,600
This is causing me trouble.
Don't look! Back.

1267
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:17,277
Okay. Suck that up.

1268
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:24,877
It's long.

1269
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:28,120
Bite down now, please. Please bite.

1270
01:27:30,692 --> 01:27:31,681
Bite.

1271
01:27:34,663 --> 01:27:35,322
Done.

1272
01:27:37,432 --> 01:27:38,763
She makes me nervous.

1273
01:27:38,900 --> 01:27:40,595
I'm going to the ladies' room.

1274
01:27:42,304 --> 01:27:44,670
I pray to God when I get back...

1275
01:27:44,739 --> 01:27:46,001
...you've changed.

1276
01:27:52,547 --> 01:27:54,139
You're Daniel's prosecutor.

1277
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:58,743
I want you to know he's wonderful.

1278
01:28:01,389 --> 01:28:02,287
You are?

1279
01:28:02,657 --> 01:28:03,419
Julia.

1280
01:28:03,491 --> 01:28:04,549
Pretty name.

1281
01:28:06,061 --> 01:28:08,086
-Nice to meet you.
-What did I say?

1282
01:28:10,532 --> 01:28:12,932
So you don't forget, I bring these.

1283
01:28:13,635 --> 01:28:15,330
You've got nine pies in here.

1284
01:28:15,437 --> 01:28:18,372
-Will that be enough for you?
-I didn't want these.

1285
01:28:18,540 --> 01:28:20,201
You told me to make them.

1286
01:28:20,408 --> 01:28:21,932
I did not.

1287
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:23,737
-You said that.
-No.

1288
01:28:23,845 --> 01:28:24,812
Yes, you did.

1289
01:28:25,213 --> 01:28:28,705
I have no place for these boxes.
You're embarrassing me.

1290
01:28:28,850 --> 01:28:29,976
You're shy.

1291
01:28:31,119 --> 01:28:33,178
I'll bring you some steaks.

1292
01:28:33,488 --> 01:28:34,682
No steaks!

1293
01:29:06,054 --> 01:29:08,318
Did Sam say what would happen to you?

1294
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:11,723
He said I wouldn't come back
to the hotel after tomorrow.

1295
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:13,826
That's all I know.

1296
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:18,392
I must tell you something.

1297
01:29:20,468 --> 01:29:23,494
-I know you think I've got it together.
-You do.

1298
01:29:23,872 --> 01:29:25,703
No, not quite.

1299
01:29:26,841 --> 01:29:30,208
But one thing I do know how to do
is make things work.

1300
01:29:30,345 --> 01:29:33,371
I can take a situation
and just make it okay.

1301
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:35,382
I've always been able to do that.

1302
01:29:35,884 --> 01:29:37,476
But it's work.

1303
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:40,110
And this...

1304
01:29:40,922 --> 01:29:42,355
...this isn't.

1305
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:44,549
I don't know what this is...

1306
01:29:45,660 --> 01:29:47,059
...but it's--

1307
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:51,898
Effortless.

1308
01:29:55,937 --> 01:29:58,462
I've never, ever had that before.

1309
01:29:58,606 --> 01:30:00,164
Tell me about it.

1310
01:30:00,275 --> 01:30:02,368
I didn't think it would happen to me.

1311
01:30:02,677 --> 01:30:05,840
Where do we find it? ln the pit stop.

1312
01:30:06,181 --> 01:30:07,842
Thanks, God.

1313
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:12,313
-Better this than nothing.
-I guess.

1314
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:17,024
Want to spend the night with me?

1315
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,621
More than anything in the world.

1316
01:30:21,663 --> 01:30:23,995
Good. Come on, let's go.

1317
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:28,869
I don't think I can. I don't think I should.

1318
01:30:30,071 --> 01:30:31,197
Why?

1319
01:30:31,940 --> 01:30:32,907
Because.

1320
01:30:34,609 --> 01:30:39,308
This is already better
than any sex I've ever had. Ever.

1321
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:44,208
I don't want to screw it up. Literally.

1322
01:30:44,285 --> 01:30:47,277
-How do you know what will happen?
-I don't.

1323
01:30:47,355 --> 01:30:50,347
Let's say it's the most amazing thing ever.

1324
01:30:50,458 --> 01:30:52,187
Then what will I do?

1325
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:55,188
I doubt we're going to the same place.

1326
01:30:55,296 --> 01:30:58,527
So, I'll just have to miss it
forever and ever?

1327
01:30:59,667 --> 01:31:01,635
And what if it's not so good?

1328
01:31:02,137 --> 01:31:04,230
I won't be able to fantasize about it.

1329
01:31:08,376 --> 01:31:09,843
I love you.

1330
01:31:22,290 --> 01:31:26,454
If I had a fire scene like you,
I would feel differently.

1331
01:31:26,661 --> 01:31:28,993
I'd stay here. I'd never leave.

1332
01:31:29,831 --> 01:31:33,062
But I've been defending myself so hard...

1333
01:31:33,368 --> 01:31:35,859
...and I don't want to be judged anymore.

1334
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:39,502
I have this wonderful feeling inside of me,
but I'm....

1335
01:31:40,975 --> 01:31:42,966
I'm just tired of being judged.

1336
01:31:44,913 --> 01:31:46,904
It's okay.

1337
01:31:48,550 --> 01:31:51,041
-I'll miss you.
-I'll miss you so much.

1338
01:31:51,319 --> 01:31:52,877
I love you, Daniel.

1339
01:31:53,454 --> 01:31:54,614
I'll miss you.

1340
01:32:05,400 --> 01:32:06,492
I should go.

1341
01:33:06,527 --> 01:33:08,961
Can you get me the Majestic Hotel?

1342
01:33:15,069 --> 01:33:16,696
Yes, Julia.

1343
01:33:18,706 --> 01:33:21,106
My God, I don't know her last name!

1344
01:33:21,609 --> 01:33:22,667
Excuse me?

1345
01:33:22,744 --> 01:33:26,976
I am in love with a woman in your hotel
and I don't know her last name.

1346
01:33:28,082 --> 01:33:30,016
What's her first name?

1347
01:33:30,785 --> 01:33:34,414
We have two Julias.
Both have "Do Not Disturb" signs on.

1348
01:33:34,555 --> 01:33:37,217
Can you ring through? It's important.

1349
01:33:37,558 --> 01:33:39,458
I'm not allowed to do that.

1350
01:33:39,560 --> 01:33:41,653
But it's very important.

1351
01:33:41,863 --> 01:33:43,421
I'm sorry.

1352
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:48,493
Can I leave a message then?
For both of them.

1353
01:33:48,603 --> 01:33:50,036
Go ahead, sir.

1354
01:33:51,439 --> 01:33:53,100
Tell them both that...

1355
01:33:54,242 --> 01:33:56,574
...l love them more than life itself.

1356
01:33:57,478 --> 01:34:00,038
I've never met anybody like them...

1357
01:34:01,115 --> 01:34:03,948
...and I'll miss them forever and ever.

1358
01:34:04,519 --> 01:34:06,077
Is that all, sir?

1359
01:34:06,888 --> 01:34:08,082
That's all.

1360
01:34:13,695 --> 01:34:17,187
Has Mr. Miller overcome his fears,
Your Honors?

1361
01:34:18,199 --> 01:34:20,827
I believe my final summation scene...

1362
01:34:20,935 --> 01:34:24,462
...will prove to you that he has.

1363
01:34:29,110 --> 01:34:33,046
Your middle-thirties were not very good
for you, were they?

1364
01:34:35,049 --> 01:34:38,610
A bad divorce left you
with virtually nothing financially.

1365
01:34:38,686 --> 01:34:42,247
You had about $9,000 to your name,
correct?

1366
01:34:43,725 --> 01:34:45,283
Months before your divorce...

1367
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,462
...you and your wife purchased tickets
to Hong Kong.

1368
01:34:50,231 --> 01:34:52,290
You were going to go together...

1369
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:56,930
...but after the separation,
she cashed hers in.

1370
01:34:58,072 --> 01:34:59,539
What did you do with yours?

1371
01:35:00,808 --> 01:35:01,775
I used it.

1372
01:35:02,977 --> 01:35:04,808
He used it.

1373
01:35:06,314 --> 01:35:08,646
With only $9,000 to his name...

1374
01:35:08,916 --> 01:35:12,147
...with his life in a rut,
he didn't do the safe thing.

1375
01:35:12,820 --> 01:35:14,788
He could have cashed in his ticket.

1376
01:35:14,856 --> 01:35:18,792
But he said,
"To hell with it, I'm going to Hong Kong."

1377
01:35:20,628 --> 01:35:23,563
That alone, in my book, takes a lot of guts.

1378
01:35:24,098 --> 01:35:26,498
But, Your Honors, it just begins there.

1379
01:35:26,734 --> 01:35:29,430
Let us go to 36-9-16.

1380
01:35:30,438 --> 01:35:33,168
Los Angeles lnternational Airport.

1381
01:35:33,841 --> 01:35:35,672
You're in seat 41 B.

1382
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,104
Between A and C.

1383
01:35:41,449 --> 01:35:42,882
Yes, it is.

1384
01:35:43,885 --> 01:35:46,615
I'm sitting between people
all the way to Asia?

1385
01:35:47,055 --> 01:35:48,283
Yes, you are.

1386
01:35:50,191 --> 01:35:52,352
Is coach completely full?

1387
01:35:52,627 --> 01:35:53,958
Oh, yes.

1388
01:35:58,166 --> 01:36:00,225
Any space left in first class?

1389
01:36:03,037 --> 01:36:04,334
There's one seat left.

1390
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:08,374
-What's the price difference?
-Round-trip?

1391
01:36:10,378 --> 01:36:14,041
It's an additional $3,194.

1392
01:36:20,054 --> 01:36:21,385
I'll take it.

1393
01:36:24,992 --> 01:36:27,153
This man just spent one-third...

1394
01:36:27,261 --> 01:36:31,095
...of his entire life savings
to be more comfortable.

1395
01:36:32,166 --> 01:36:33,497
What does that say?

1396
01:36:33,768 --> 01:36:37,363
As stressed out and crazy
as his life was at that moment...

1397
01:36:37,672 --> 01:36:40,436
...the little boy inside him cried out:

1398
01:36:40,675 --> 01:36:45,442
"I need this. Don't worry about money.
We'll get it back. Be nice to me."

1399
01:36:46,514 --> 01:36:48,311
And he was.

1400
01:36:51,018 --> 01:36:54,181
I feel Mr. Miller is sufficiently past
the fears...

1401
01:36:54,422 --> 01:36:59,359
...that would keep him from being
a remarkable citizen of the Universe.

1402
01:37:00,027 --> 01:37:04,361
I wholeheartedly recommend
full onward movement.

1403
01:37:05,266 --> 01:37:06,426
I rest.

1404
01:37:07,135 --> 01:37:08,568
Miss Foster, you're up.

1405
01:37:13,374 --> 01:37:17,640
At this point, I would like to show
my final summation scene.

1406
01:37:18,446 --> 01:37:19,174
Proceed.

1407
01:37:20,047 --> 01:37:23,210
My scene takes place not there, but here.

1408
01:37:24,785 --> 01:37:26,776
We're showing something from here?

1409
01:37:27,121 --> 01:37:28,281
Yes, we are.

1410
01:37:28,422 --> 01:37:30,481
I was told we're not doing that anymore.

1411
01:37:30,558 --> 01:37:32,389
No one told you that.

1412
01:37:33,127 --> 01:37:34,355
What are we seeing?

1413
01:37:34,795 --> 01:37:36,194
Something from last night.

1414
01:37:37,899 --> 01:37:41,300
Please watch this
and tell me what you were feeling.

1415
01:37:48,976 --> 01:37:50,739
Want to spend the night with me?

1416
01:37:50,978 --> 01:37:53,071
More than anything in the world.

1417
01:37:54,682 --> 01:37:55,876
I don't think I can.

1418
01:37:56,417 --> 01:37:58,044
I don't think I should.

1419
01:37:58,119 --> 01:37:59,108
Why?

1420
01:38:00,188 --> 01:38:03,248
If I had a fire scene like you,
I'd feel differently.

1421
01:38:03,491 --> 01:38:05,686
I'd stay here. I'd never leave.

1422
01:38:05,993 --> 01:38:09,326
But I've been defending myself so hard...

1423
01:38:09,497 --> 01:38:11,897
...and I don't want to be judged anymore.

1424
01:38:12,433 --> 01:38:15,630
I have this wonderful feeling inside of me,
but I'm....

1425
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:19,732
I'm just tired of being judged.

1426
01:38:30,451 --> 01:38:33,682
You genuinely feel for this woman,
don't you?

1427
01:38:36,524 --> 01:38:38,754
Why didn't you stay with her?

1428
01:38:40,461 --> 01:38:41,951
I was afraid.

1429
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:43,462
Louder.

1430
01:38:43,698 --> 01:38:44,960
I was afraid.

1431
01:38:53,307 --> 01:38:54,638
I rest.

1432
01:38:56,544 --> 01:38:58,876
This is a new one on me.

1433
01:38:59,046 --> 01:39:01,776
Sex with somebody and move right on.

1434
01:39:02,483 --> 01:39:05,213
Is that how it works, Miss Foster?

1435
01:39:07,154 --> 01:39:11,386
You're not very understanding
about the world Mr. Miller came from.

1436
01:39:11,659 --> 01:39:14,127
It's filled with problems
you no longer have:

1437
01:39:14,729 --> 01:39:19,223
Deadly diseases,
confusing identities, changing attitudes.

1438
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:23,036
Perhaps he was worried
about getting a disease.

1439
01:39:23,904 --> 01:39:26,065
Were you worried about getting a disease?

1440
01:39:26,574 --> 01:39:28,838
I didn't think she had a disease. No.

1441
01:39:29,076 --> 01:39:30,839
But you didn't know.

1442
01:39:30,911 --> 01:39:32,435
We're getting off the point.

1443
01:39:32,513 --> 01:39:36,347
We've never been near the point!
You're getting him both ways!

1444
01:39:36,417 --> 01:39:40,251
When he's brave and then does something
you don't like, you show the follow-up.

1445
01:39:40,588 --> 01:39:42,920
Or you blame him for not having any.

1446
01:39:43,090 --> 01:39:47,254
This is an example of something
he wanted to do. And he didn't...

1447
01:39:47,695 --> 01:39:49,526
...because he was afraid.

1448
01:39:49,864 --> 01:39:51,331
This was just last night.

1449
01:39:51,699 --> 01:39:54,031
You know what I think we just watched?

1450
01:39:54,302 --> 01:39:58,966
I think we just watched a man who was
caring of another human being's feelings.

1451
01:39:59,440 --> 01:40:04,036
He didn't know what this experience
would do to her, so he was careful.

1452
01:40:04,545 --> 01:40:05,842
But you blame him for it.

1453
01:40:06,547 --> 01:40:07,980
I praise him for it.

1454
01:40:08,282 --> 01:40:11,718
You call it "fear." I call it "thoughtfulness."

1455
01:40:12,053 --> 01:40:16,387
To be caring about someone else's feelings.

1456
01:40:17,291 --> 01:40:20,454
I'm sorry,
but I hope we all can have that quality.

1457
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,434
Your final summation, please.

1458
01:40:30,304 --> 01:40:32,772
I think it was thoughtfulness.

1459
01:40:33,641 --> 01:40:36,405
I'd like to say something
about this disease.

1460
01:40:36,644 --> 01:40:39,807
Your Honors,
I didn't think Julia had a disease.

1461
01:40:40,081 --> 01:40:42,549
But right now on Earth...

1462
01:40:42,616 --> 01:40:45,949
...they're filling our heads
with these terrible things.

1463
01:40:46,287 --> 01:40:50,383
They tell you over and over
you're not sleeping with one person.

1464
01:40:51,258 --> 01:40:54,227
You're sleeping with everyone
they've ever slept with.

1465
01:40:54,595 --> 01:40:57,257
Now that I've been
to the Past Lives Pavilion...

1466
01:40:57,331 --> 01:40:59,561
...that could be 20 to 30,000 people.

1467
01:41:01,836 --> 01:41:06,671
As far as my life is concerned,
I truly believe I turned the corner.

1468
01:41:06,941 --> 01:41:11,275
I know I had a few fears left,
but I was taken very young.

1469
01:41:11,379 --> 01:41:12,812
I could've conquered them.

1470
01:41:14,582 --> 01:41:16,948
If you see fit to let me move forward...

1471
01:41:17,284 --> 01:41:20,515
...l promise you, I will do the best I can.

1472
01:41:20,855 --> 01:41:23,847
I will work very hard,
I'll do whatever is asked.

1473
01:41:24,125 --> 01:41:25,956
I'll do the best I can.

1474
01:41:26,127 --> 01:41:28,118
Honestly. I will.

1475
01:41:29,363 --> 01:41:31,354
I'll do the best I can.

1476
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:34,358
Is that all?

1477
01:41:37,972 --> 01:41:39,701
Please just know that I'll--

1478
01:41:39,974 --> 01:41:41,339
Do the best you can?

1479
01:41:43,210 --> 01:41:44,177
Good.

1480
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:46,707
That's all.

1481
01:41:55,990 --> 01:41:58,390
It was nice to meet you. Good luck.

1482
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:02,653
That's it.

1483
01:42:02,897 --> 01:42:05,866
Let's go back to my office.
We'll know in 30 minutes.

1484
01:42:24,251 --> 01:42:25,513
Judgment's in.

1485
01:42:25,686 --> 01:42:26,846
It's early.

1486
01:42:27,021 --> 01:42:29,581
-Is that good?
-It's not good or bad.

1487
01:42:35,062 --> 01:42:38,156
They don't waste any time.
They must need the hotel space.

1488
01:42:42,102 --> 01:42:45,663
How do you like our city?
We do a pretty good job here.

1489
01:42:45,906 --> 01:42:47,373
How was the ltalian restaurant?

1490
01:42:47,475 --> 01:42:48,840
What does it say?

1491
01:42:50,377 --> 01:42:51,537
You're going back.

1492
01:42:55,883 --> 01:42:57,282
Can I say something?

1493
01:42:57,985 --> 01:43:00,977
Because they're sending you back
doesn't mean they're right.

1494
01:43:01,789 --> 01:43:03,552
They can make mistakes.

1495
01:43:05,459 --> 01:43:07,450
Don't let others get to you.

1496
01:43:08,229 --> 01:43:09,890
Just follow what's in here.

1497
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:16,595
Come on. I'll take you to the station.

1498
01:43:19,573 --> 01:43:22,542
Trams 7 and 8 to onward destinations....

1499
01:43:22,810 --> 01:43:26,473
I'll never get over it.
The organization is amazing.

1500
01:43:26,847 --> 01:43:30,442
All these different trams going everywhere.

1501
01:43:32,319 --> 01:43:36,255
These are yours.
Your boarding card, various ID.

1502
01:43:36,490 --> 01:43:38,321
The things you'll need.

1503
01:43:38,759 --> 01:43:43,093
You won't remember any of this,
so you won't kick yourself forever.

1504
01:43:43,330 --> 01:43:46,766
Just take the opportunities
when they come, okay?

1505
01:43:47,701 --> 01:43:51,603
Passengers going back to Earth,
please board trams on your left.

1506
01:43:52,172 --> 01:43:55,232
Those moving onward,
board trams to the right.

1507
01:43:56,110 --> 01:43:58,271
This is it.

1508
01:43:59,446 --> 01:44:02,609
Good luck. I've got a lot of faith in you.

1509
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:11,851
I can take that here.

1510
01:44:12,192 --> 01:44:14,854
Keep those and follow the yellow line.

1511
01:44:20,034 --> 01:44:22,594
All trams now operational.

1512
01:44:28,309 --> 01:44:32,040
Trams 7 and 8 to onward destinations...

1513
01:44:32,112 --> 01:44:34,080
...final boarding please.

1514
01:44:42,556 --> 01:44:43,989
Here, sir.

1515
01:44:54,602 --> 01:44:57,537
All personnel, please prepare for departure.

1516
01:45:05,012 --> 01:45:06,001
Daniel!

1517
01:45:06,413 --> 01:45:07,744
Julia!

1518
01:45:32,106 --> 01:45:33,437
What are you doing?

1519
01:45:37,144 --> 01:45:39,135
Sit down! You'll hurt yourself!

1520
01:46:22,990 --> 01:46:24,423
I love you.

1521
01:46:24,758 --> 01:46:26,726
I called, but I didn't know your last name.

1522
01:46:27,528 --> 01:46:28,688
I won't let you go.

1523
01:46:28,762 --> 01:46:29,922
I won't let you go.

1524
01:46:30,431 --> 01:46:32,092
Help! Help!

1525
01:46:40,774 --> 01:46:43,242
Hold on! Just please, hold on!

1526
01:46:43,844 --> 01:46:44,811
I love you.

1527
01:46:45,012 --> 01:46:46,206
I love you.

1528
01:46:50,784 --> 01:46:52,342
Open this up!

1529
01:46:52,686 --> 01:46:54,119
Damn it, open it!

1530
01:46:54,455 --> 01:46:56,616
Please open the door!

1531
01:46:57,124 --> 01:46:59,456
Julia! Wait for me!

1532
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:04,028
Brave enough for you?

1533
01:47:05,532 --> 01:47:07,796
Open the door! Please!

1534
01:47:15,876 --> 01:47:17,036
Let him go.
