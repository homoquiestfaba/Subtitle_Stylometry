00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:39,478
Because? You've been into her forever,
and it's just not healthy.

You're obsessed or something.
So?

76
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,718
So, Ryan, every guy

Excuse me.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:19,138
Oh, gotta pay the toll.

120

You want me to kick you

121
00:07:20,674 --> 00:07:23,542
That depends.
Would you be naked?

122
00:07:26,212 --> 00:07:29,381
School's almost out,

123

00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:38,524
Hello, everyone.

127
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,725
I'm Katie woodman, school nurse,

128
00:07:40,727 --> 00:07:42,657
and since summer's
approaching...

129
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:46,598
I thought I'd talk to you
a little bit about safe sex.

130
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:52,237
As you know,
the safest route is abstinence.

131
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,179
But if you're going
to be sexually active,

132
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,377
there's a few things
that you need to know.

133
00:07:59,379 --> 00:07:59,999
Okay?

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,310
Okay?

135
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:04,124
<i>Where is it?</i>

136
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,758
All right.

137
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:18,530
<i>Speaking of wood, man.</i>
<i>Yeah!</i>

138
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,971
That from mommy's
personal collection?

139
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:22,397
Shut up.

140
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:26,341
<i>Those of you who may not know,</i>
<i>this is the penis.</i>

141
00:08:26,342 --> 00:08:29,999
<i>Okay, this is the male sexual organ...</i>
come to my house after school.

142
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,580
<i>Okay, this is the male sexual organ...</i>
come to my house after school.

143
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:34,747
You want to? I'm having some friends over.
It will be fun.

144
00:08:34,748 --> 00:08:37,348
<i>The penis also carries urinary responsibility.</i>

145
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,420
<i>I can't.
I got plans.</i>

146
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:46,091
<i>That means that this
goes hand in hand with...</i>

147
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:47,626
The latex condom.

148
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,557
Yeah!

149
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:54,066
Oh, man.

150
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:56,907
<i>To be effective,</i>
<i>it needs to be pulled down all the way.</i>

151
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,143
God,
that was like a bad dream.

152
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:06,712
Every man needs a dream,

153
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,249
and mine is to become
the next Virgil Doolittle.

154
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,588
You know what
he got expelled for?

155
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:15,354
Yeah, he stole gilmore's neck.
That's right.

156
00:09:15,355 --> 00:09:19,124
<i>Cooper gilmore has no neck
all because of Virgil Doolittle.</i>

157
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:22,255
He got arrested.
And was charged with mayhem.

158
00:09:22,262 --> 00:09:25,000
Mayhem! How cool is that?
The man's a legend.

159
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,498
The man went to prison, Floyd. Allegedly.

160
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,999
And besides, who cares?
It's been 21 years, and Doolittle lives on.

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,240
And besides, who cares?
It's been 21 years, and Doolittle lives on.

162
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:36,508

a recent survey showed that most women do prefer a man of danger.

- Yeah, maybe a little.

174

- Yeah, maybe a little.

175

with Floyd and the boys.

176
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:37,035
- No, you got yourself a date.
- Thanks, Ryan.

177
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,266
I should be thanking you.

178
00:10:39,272 --> 00:10:40,672
Good night.

179
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:46,353
Good night.

180
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,451
One out now.
Here we go!

181
00:10:49,452 --> 00:10:52,618
I hear you're going to prom
with Maggie. Are you?

182
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:56,155
Where'd you hear that?

183
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:59,656
<i>Stand up there,
Betty boop.</i> It's all over school.

184
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,662
Maggie told me.
You excited?

185
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,232
Woodman my ass.
You got no lumber.

186
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:09,103
You're stickless.
You got no stick.

187
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:11,642
- Floyd, it's Maggie.
- Maggie's fine.

188
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:14,338
<i>Dig in now here.
Closer.</i>

189
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,078
Look, I know everything
there is to know about Maggie.

190
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:19,276
- Closer.
- It would be like kissing my sister.

191
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,549
Which isn't a terrible thing
in some parts of the world.

192
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,285
Walk it off.

193
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,996
Hey.
How many fingers?

194
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,460
Hey.
How many fingers?

195
00:11:30,461 --> 00:11:34,056
Eleventy-seven?

196

<i>Serrin, come on,</i>
<i>you're next. Let's go.</i>

197
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:38,497
Are you okay?
Yeah.

198
00:11:38,498 --> 00:11:42,198
The coach hit you.
Asshole. Ow!

199
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,672
Let's get out of here.
<i>Walk it off.</i>

200
00:11:44,673 --> 00:11:47,309
<i>I got a surprise for you, buddy.</i>

201
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,707
Where the hell we going?
Right on time for the floor show.

202
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,999
- Can we come in?
- It's 20 bucks.

203
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,090
- Can we come in?
- It's 20 bucks.

204
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:04,287

- In five seconds, it goes up to 30.

205
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,730
God!

206
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:11,355
Come on, let's go.

207
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,498
For one.
<i>What? What?</i>

208
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:16,139
Go! You owe me!
I want instant recall!

209
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,465
Rent-a-cop!

210
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,505
Excuse me, sir.
Come on. Let's move.

211
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,506
Sir, I don't know
where we're going.

212

<i>It should be empty now.
You got two minutes.</i>

213
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:29,278

<i>You get busted, you do not know me.</i>

214
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:38,759
Go on in. You don't have all day.
Move. Go.

<i>Can I borrow your brush?</i>

216
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,384
<i>Yeah.</i>

Did you get a good look?

220
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:20,227
Hey, hold up.
Wish I could, my brother,

221
00:14:20,228 --> 00:14:22,196
but you know how it is, right?

222
00:14:22,197 --> 00:14:24,195
Maybe we can hang out sometime,

223
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,167
troll for some skank
or skank for some troll.

224
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:29,096
What?

225
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,205
What's up with Maggie Carter?

226
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,237
Yeah, man, what's up
with that little sassy?

227
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,311
Why do you ask?

228
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:42,247
Maybe I'm interested.
In Maggie Carter?

229
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,448
Trust me, I've known her my whole life.
She's not your type.

230
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:49,521
Actually, grant's not yours either,
but I could hook you up.

231
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:51,390
Homestyle's got the hookup.

232
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,260
Who says I'm into Ashley grant?
Oh, come on.

233
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:59,264
I seen you checking her out all year.
Just thought I could help you out.

234
00:14:59,265 --> 00:14:59,995
- What's the catch?
- Why does there got to be a catch?

235
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,367
- What's the catch?
- Why does there got to be a catch?

236
00:15:02,368 --> 00:15:05,198
I don't know.
Maybe because you haven't said dick to me in four years,

237
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,174
and suddenly you're
trying to help me out.

238
00:15:07,175 --> 00:15:10,675
You're right. I don't know you.
You don't know me.

239
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:15,046
But prom's coming up.
I'm into Maggie. You're into Ashley.

240
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,277
She ever mention me?
No.

241
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:21,553
- Bitch.
- So what makes you think I have a chance with her then?

242
00:15:21,554 --> 00:15:26,057
You don't, but Ashley's my cousin,
and I can help you.

243
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,094
Same goes for me with Maggie.
I don't know.

244
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:29,995
Why Maggie?
You could date any girl in this school.

245
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,370
Why Maggie?
You could date any girl in this school.

246
00:15:32,371 --> 00:15:35,265
But Maggie's special.
I can tell.

247
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:41,168
What do you say?
You be me, and I'll be you.

<i>I can't send her that.</i>

No. She's gonna hate me, man!

266
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:29,087
Hey, exactly.
I sent Maggie poetry from you.

267
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:29,998
Every guy in school wants to say something nice to Ashley grant.

268

00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,549
- Maybe she's nervous.
- Nervous stomach?

507
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:52,748
- Yeah.
- Yeah, probably the pill.

508
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:57,259
Put me on hold, and I'll try
to talk you through this.

509
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,285
But keep coming back
to me, okay?

510
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,660
Let's start with...
"I was really looking forward to seeing you tonight.

511
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:08,999
We seem to have a lot in common."
Yadda-yadda.

512
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
No, I don't think
"bitch, we had plans" will work.

513
00:31:12,003 --> 00:31:15,272
Hold on.

514
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:18,509
Maggie?

515
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:21,510
Sorry about the wait.
It's cool.

516
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,381
So...

517
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,322
Great. Now that's my other line.
Can you hold on a second?

518
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,996
What happened? Oh, my God!
Your mom fell down the stairs!

519
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,560
What happened? Oh, my God!
Your mom fell down the stairs!

520
00:31:30,561 --> 00:31:32,455
- What?
- Mrs. Carter, are you okay?

521
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:36,257
Chris, can I call you back?

522
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,567
Talk.
<i>I just bought us a few seconds.</i>

523
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:47,004
Dude, you let her go.
She's not going.

524
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,165
She is going.
Tell her you need to talk to a friend tonight.

525
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:51,512
- Why?
- You're depressed. Your grades suck.

526
00:31:51,513 --> 00:31:55,349
- Your father's on crack.
- My dad played pro football.

527
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:58,077
- Perfect!
- You're getting your ass kicked for that.

528
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,001
<i>I don't know what your problem is, Ryan.</i>

529
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:00,520
<i>I don't know what your problem is, Ryan.</i>

530
00:32:00,521 --> 00:32:03,319
Okay, she's back.

531
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:06,357
Now, don't screw this up.

532
00:32:06,358 --> 00:32:09,326
Hold on.

533
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:11,157
Hello.

534
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:12,603
Sorry.
Sorry.

535
00:32:12,604 --> 00:32:17,134
Hello? Chris?
Chris, are you there?

536
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:22,405
Y-yeah, I'm here...

537
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,737
Baby.

538
00:32:24,743 --> 00:32:27,353
Are you okay?
'Cause you sound kind of different.

539
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:29,995
Yeah, well, um...
Oh, yeah, see, um...

540
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,284
Yeah, well, um...
Oh, yeah, see, um...

541
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,455
The battery's running low on my wireless,
so I have to put you on speaker.

542
00:32:37,456 --> 00:32:40,086
- Can you hang on?
- Okay.

543
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,004
Just a second.

544
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,441
Okay.

545
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,008
Sorry about that.
Can you hear me now?

546
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:59,707
Yeah, sort of.
Listen, I hope you're not sick.

547
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:00,001
Well, you know... I'm sick
about this not happening.

548
00:33:00,002 --> 00:33:04,315
Well, you know... I'm sick
about this not happening.

549
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:10,016
I mean, I know I'm a jock.
I'm brainless,

550
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:12,590
conceited, in love with myself.

551
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:16,660
<i>At least, that's how
you must see me.</i>

552
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,731
But let me tell you
how I see you.

553
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:26,737
The you I see...
Has a big heart.

554
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,998
She's smart,
fun to hang around with,

555
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,210
she's smart,
fun to hang around with,

556
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:33,109
doesn't take my shit.

557
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:37,079
And I like that.

558
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,986
I like that you look nervous
sometimes for no reason.

559
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,157
And when you do,
you bite your lip.

560
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:49,164
I like that you probably rifled through your closet tonight...

561
00:33:49,165 --> 00:33:52,530
And settled with
what you'd started out with.

562
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,734
I like your smile.

563
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:59,995
I don't usually talk
this way, but, uh...

564
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,110
I don't usually talk
this way, but, uh...

565
00:34:02,111 --> 00:34:08,245
I think being with you
wouldn't be irrelevant.

566
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,214
You know what I'm saying?

567
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,645
Or maybe I should just stop
with all this weak shit.

568
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:17,254
- No, it's nice.
- Oh. All right.

569
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:24,258
So let's do this, huh?
You know? No pressure.

570
00:34:24,262 --> 00:34:27,131
We'll go hang out, the four of us,
get to know each other.

571
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:29,999
- We could talk, maybe...
- Swap some spit.

572
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,680
- We could talk, maybe...
- Swap some spit.

573
00:34:32,971 --> 00:34:35,506
- Okay.
- Famous!

574
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:39,177
- What?
- I said, uh, thank you.

575
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,223
Oh, yeah.

Great.
Why don't you get me one too?

591
00:35:56,254 --> 00:35:59,189
Hey, good one!
That's funny. That's...

592
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,000
No, we'll get it.
Okay, Ashley?

593
00:36:00,001 --> 00:36:01,659
No, we'll get it.
Okay, Ashley?

594
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,060
Okay.
Let's go.

595
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,999
Jesus, I'm dying over there.

596
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,236
Rejection, man.
You gotta piss her off.

597
00:36:12,237 --> 00:36:15,706
Tell her... Her breath is rank.
I'm not telling her that.

598
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:19,476
Whatever, man.
I'm telling Carter she needs a tit job.

599
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:22,607
I'm just pulling your dick.
What do you want me to say?

600
00:36:22,614 --> 00:36:25,284
Why don't you just be
the strong, silent type?

601
00:36:25,285 --> 00:36:27,721
If you decide to talk to her,
be nice, all right?

602
00:36:27,722 --> 00:36:29,999
Tell her she looks nice.
Tell her you like her outfit.

603
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,660
Tell her she looks nice.
Tell her you like her outfit.

604
00:36:30,661 --> 00:36:34,985
Okay.
You should probably tell grant her ass looks big in those jeans.

605
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:42,028
Uh... you look nice.
I like your clothes.

606
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,601
- Thanks.
- You want some?

607
00:36:44,602 --> 00:36:48,542
Oh, my God, you guys, there's that octopus thing.
Come on, Marge, there's no line.

608
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:59,049
Whoa. Sorry, cream puff.
No beverages. What?

609
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,000
That's okay.
I'll just wait and hold it.

610
00:37:00,001 --> 00:37:01,250
That's okay.
I'll just wait and hold it.

611
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:08,189
Whew! Let's go.

612
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,360
All right, tickets.

613
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,262
Have a nice ride.

614
00:37:17,569 --> 00:37:20,104
Hey, midget man.

615
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,635
Munchkin guy,
make it go fast, all right?

616
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:37,359
Yeah!

617
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,234
Having a good time?
Yeah.

618
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,671
This is kind of fun.

619
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:59,143
Yeah!

620
00:37:59,144 --> 00:38:00,004
<i>Yeah!</i>

621
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:01,250
<i>Yeah!</i>

622
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,718
Oops.

623
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:14,558
Sorry.
Yuck!

624
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:20,731
Hi. Hey.
Hey. Hey.

625
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,302
- Did you throw up?
- No, not exactly.

626
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:25,371
<i>Sorry, bri.</i>

627
00:38:25,372 --> 00:38:27,570
Let's go.

628
00:38:27,572 --> 00:38:29,999
Hey, man,
can I borrow your shirt?

629
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,070
Hey, man,
can I borrow your shirt?

630
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:32,643
No way, man.
I'll get cold.

631
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:35,454
<i>Hey, girls, wait up.</i>

632
00:38:39,517 --> 00:38:42,047
What do I gotta do
to win a t-shirt?

633
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,659
You break it, you rake it.

634
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,685
Could you help me out, pal?
I got puke all over my shirt.

635
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:50,091
So?

636
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:57,666
Yeah!

637
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,999
Let's go, kids!
Who saw it?

638
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,310
Let's go, kids!
Who saw it?

639
00:39:01,311 --> 00:39:04,376
Who saw it?

640
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:18,057
He gave you his shirt?

641
00:39:18,058 --> 00:39:20,986
A Ferris wheel.
Let's go.

642
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:24,194
<i>What, man?
She was cold.</i>

643
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,225
Wait up, girls.

644
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:29,999
<i>Cute shirt.</i>

645
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,600
<i>Cute shirt.</i>

646
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:32,536
Thank you.

647
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:36,506
Madge, who do you hang out with at gilmore?
Because I never see you around.

648
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,507
Mostly just Ryan.

649
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,978
Ryan?
Yeah. Ryan.

650
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:43,747
See, th-that's me.
Ryan's my last name.

651
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:48,385
Wait, wait. Your name is Brian Ryan?
Cruel parents.

652
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,260
I've told you a million times.

653
00:39:58,263 --> 00:40:00,002
You've got to get
a faster modem.

654
00:40:00,003 --> 00:40:02,130
You've got to get
a faster modem.

655
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:05,572
<i>So, um, you were right,</i>
<i>that e-mail you sent me.</i>

656
00:40:05,573 --> 00:40:09,539
My hair looks terrible. No, no,
your hair doesn't look terrible.

657
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:12,009
But it hides your eyes.

658
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,510
You have really amazing eyes.

659
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:19,616
Really pretty, wandering...

660
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:22,447
Besides, compared to your jeans,
your hair is a work of art.

661
00:40:22,453 --> 00:40:25,292
<i>So it's really great
that you like the eels.</i>

662
00:40:25,293 --> 00:40:29,426
I mean, other than Ryan,
I really don't know anyone else who likes them.

663
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:29,997
Uh-huh.
The eels?

664
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,030
Uh-huh.
The eels?

665
00:40:33,031 --> 00:40:35,431
Yeah, yeah.

666
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:40,070
<i>They're... electric.</i>

667
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,110
I can't believe you don't like these jeans.
They were really expensive.

668
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:48,109
- Even worse.
- Shut up!

669
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:52,482
It's the rhinestones,
isn't it? For starters.

670
00:40:52,483 --> 00:40:55,593
- Who else do you like?
- I like you.

671
00:41:00,358 --> 00:41:05,158
Mommy, can I have some cotton...

672
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:06,763
Anything else you
don't like about me?

673
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:09,974
- I could do without those shoes.
- What is wrong with my shoes?

674
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:14,068
- They're monstrous, bigfoot.
- Shut up.

675
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:16,442
I like that shirt.

676
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:25,148
<i>♪ Did I find you ♪
♪ did I find you ♪</i>

677
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:29,999
<i>♪ hanging on the edge of the crowd ♪</i> sloane,
you did not.

678
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,120
<i>♪ Hanging on the edge of the crowd ♪</i> sloane,
you did not.

679
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:32,121
Oh, my God.

680
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,763
Later, Chris.
See you, Brian.

681
00:41:33,764 --> 00:41:36,128
I gotta go.
Bri.

682
00:41:41,099 --> 00:41:44,139
Well, thanks.

683
00:41:57,048 --> 00:41:59,998
Bye.
Bye.

684
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,000
Bye.
Bye.

685
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,755
Good night.

686
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:09,291
Good night.

687
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,633
Good night.

688
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,144
Good night.

689
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,005
The things I do for you.

690
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:25,236
You didn't like him?
I don't know.

691
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,583
What's the problem?
I'm just not sure he has any heart.

692
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:36,321
Okay, it's a beautiful
spring day outside.

693
00:42:36,322 --> 00:42:38,290
Most of you are graduating soon.

694
00:42:38,291 --> 00:42:43,159
You've got your entire lives ahead of you,
so let's talk about death.

695
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,531
<i>We all know lung cancer's a serious killer in this country,</i>

696
00:42:45,532 --> 00:42:48,030
what? <i>As is aids,
leukemia and diabetes.</i>

697
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,502
How'd I do last night?
<i>What is the leading cause of death in America?</i>

698
00:42:50,503 --> 00:42:54,041
Okay, but she says you don't have enough heart.
"Heart"?

699
00:42:54,042 --> 00:42:57,338
Thank you, Mr. Campbell.

700
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,999
Heart disease
is the correct answer.

701
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,410
Heart disease
is the correct answer.

702
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,979
Oh.
Nice.

703
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:05,080
Last year alone...

704
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:10,053
<i>Okay, make sure
you finish chapter 14.</i>

705
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:14,034
I guess it could be worse.
Grant doesn't think you have any stones.

706
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:16,225
What?
She said that? Yeah.

707
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,627
But you're gonna play football with me and some of the guys today.

708
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:22,399
She'll be there?
Yeah. She loves it.

709
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,000
We'll make you look great.

710
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,602
Hey, man, is Ashley okay?

711
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:29,005
She's a little different
than I expected.

712
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:29,996
Did you go out with your dream girl,
and you don't like her?

713
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,240
Did you go out with your dream girl,
and you don't like her?

714
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:34,044
No, it's not that.
It's just...

715
00:43:34,045 --> 00:43:36,705
- Good.
- Bad. Yeah.

716
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:38,982
Oh, she was nervous.

717
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:42,686
She gets that way
when she really likes somebody.

718
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:45,687
Hey,
you gonna play with us today or what?

719
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:48,530
Touch football, right?
Of course.

720
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:56,600
Get up, man. She's watching.

721
00:43:56,601 --> 00:43:59,999
Okay, time-out. You said
this was touch football.

722
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:01,920
Okay, time-out. You said
this was touch football.

723
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:05,342
It is. These guys
just touch hard.

724
00:44:05,343 --> 00:44:07,611
I am not doing this, okay?

725
00:44:07,612 --> 00:44:10,722
These guys are like some huge government experiment gone wrong.

726
00:44:10,723 --> 00:44:13,645
Come on.
Grant's loving it.

727
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:32,367
<i>God.</i>

728
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:40,277
Ouch.

729
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:42,278
Get up, man.

730
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,220
I used to play a little ball
back in the day.

731
00:44:45,221 --> 00:44:48,646
Back in what day?

732
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,364
Ready to end this thing, Brian?
Who the hell is Brian?

733
00:44:53,365 --> 00:44:58,327
Nice. Okay, you snap it to Brian.
You follow me.

734
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,999
Ready?
Break!

735
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:00,570
Ready?
Break!

736
00:45:00,571 --> 00:45:02,095
Hut!

737
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:08,474
<i>Go, baby.</i>
<i>Go, baby! Yeah! Go home!</i>

738
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:12,377
<i>Go! Go, baby!</i>

739
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,378
Yeah!

740
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:17,714
Yeah!

741
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:24,387
<i>All right, Brian!</i>

742
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:26,318
Yeah!

743
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:29,999
Oh! Oh! That's cheating!

744
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,400
Oh! Oh! That's cheating!

745
00:45:31,401 --> 00:45:33,525
Yeah!

746
00:45:33,531 --> 00:45:35,531
We're here for you, buddy.

747
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:39,402
Hey... nice game.

748
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,343
Pick me up tomorrow morning
at 7:00.

749
00:45:41,344 --> 00:45:44,207
Okay.

750
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:47,578
Well, I've done my part.

751
00:45:49,046 --> 00:45:50,676
Now let's go get me that heart.

752
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:57,754
<i>What are we doing here?</i>
<i>She wants heart.</i>

753
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,995
We'll give her heart.
You want her to fall for you, right?

754
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:00,420
We'll give her heart.
You want her to fall for you, right?

755
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:03,393
Not like this.
These people smell.

756
00:46:03,394 --> 00:46:08,304
This better work. Trust me,
this will work. Okay?

757
00:46:13,304 --> 00:46:16,014
Wh-what are you doing?
She's not eating it.

758
00:46:16,015 --> 00:46:21,007
Maggie's gonna be here any second.
All right. Wait.

759
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,312
I give her the speech.

760
00:46:23,314 --> 00:46:25,448
If she digs it, then what?

761
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,418
Then I don't know.
Try talking to her.

762
00:46:28,419 --> 00:46:29,999
- Tell her how you feel.
- See if she needs a lift home.

763
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,220
- Tell her how you feel.
- See if she needs a lift home.

764
00:46:32,223 --> 00:46:35,193
All right,
I'll think of something. Okay.

765
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:41,602
She's coming.
Put that jell-o down!

766
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,705
Hey, could you maybe...
God, no... shh!

767
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,375
Chris?

768
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,077
Hey, you work here too?

769
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:58,448
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

770
00:46:58,449 --> 00:46:59,999
I, uh...

771
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,990
I, uh...

772
00:47:00,991 --> 00:47:03,615
I like to come here
from time to time...

773
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:06,191
Uh, to visit
with the sickly and old.

774
00:47:07,591 --> 00:47:12,595
You think that's gay?
No, I think it's nice.

775
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:15,365
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

776
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:18,335
Well, that's what I do.

777
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:22,066
- Who ate my jell-o?
- Pipe down, you old bag.

778
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:25,241
- I want my jell-o.
- Fine.

779
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,382
Brian, give me that jell-o.

780
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,649
<i>Hey, that's my jell-o.</i>

781
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:35,485
Here it comes.
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

782
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:38,056
I think it's sweet
that you come here, Chris.

783
00:47:38,057 --> 00:47:41,055
Mm-hmm. Don't you think it's sweet,
miss Simms?

784
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:43,688
- Just heavenly.
- Yeah.

785
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,097
I have to go to the bathroom.
Number two.

786
00:47:47,098 --> 00:47:48,528
Okay.
You want me to take you to the bathroom?

787
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,368
No.

788
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,738
- You want Chris to take you?
- That would be nice.

789
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:58,108
- Do you mind?
- I was hoping that she'd ask.

790
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:04,379
Now, don't drop me.

791
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,434
Well, I guess this room's
in good hands.

792
00:48:24,435 --> 00:48:26,635
Yeah.
I should get going.

793
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:28,505
Oh... okay.

794
00:48:28,506 --> 00:48:29,996
That is a really nice outfit.

795
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,540
That is a really nice outfit.

796
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:34,144
Ride home.
Ride home.

797
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:38,245
Do you want a ride home?
No, I have some stuff to do at the school theater.

798
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:41,618
There's a school theater?
Since when?

799
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:44,654
I mean, uh... that's cool.
I don't mind.

800
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,485
Okay.
Yeah.

801
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:50,431
I'll meet you downstairs in 15 minutes?
Fifteen minutes.

802
00:48:50,432 --> 00:48:53,558
Okay.
Okay.

803
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,399
The theater.
That's perfect.

804
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,400
Yeah, right.
Look, nobody better see me there.

805
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,550
So... are you in a play
or something?

806
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:17,420
Me? No.
I'm not much of a thespian.

807
00:49:17,421 --> 00:49:19,559
Yeah, well, I hope not.

808
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,727
I'd be wasting my time
if you're only into chicks.

809
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:27,495
So do you like plays?

810
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:29,998
Oh, yeah.
We got this one...

811
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:30,170
Oh, yeah.
We got this one...

812
00:49:30,171 --> 00:49:34,737
It's a power 41 q.B. Follow.
I fake it off to the halfback.

813
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:38,138
<i>Then I crush skulls
up the middle.</i>

814
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:43,212
I meant stage plays.
Yeah. I was just joking.

815
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,592
Man, where have you been?
I'm dying over here.

816
00:49:52,593 --> 00:49:54,430
Will you help me out?
Shh.

817
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:56,725
<i>Hey, Chris.</i> Yeah?

818
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,195
Let me ask you something.
Okay.

819
00:49:59,196 --> 00:49:59,996
Why are you so interested in me?

820
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,030
Why are you so interested in me?

821
00:50:01,031 --> 00:50:05,301
We don't really make sense
as a couple, do we?

822
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:09,205
Well, uh... yeah, well, uh...

823
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:12,406
Sometimes the best things in life don't make sense.

824
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,479
Sometimes the best things
in life don't make sense.

825
00:50:16,514 --> 00:50:18,081
Like rainbows.

826
00:50:18,082 --> 00:50:20,216
Like rainbows.

827
00:50:20,217 --> 00:50:22,147
And flowers
that bloom in winter.

828
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,020
Flowers blooming in the winter.

829
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:29,999
Besides, I think you could help me to be a better person.

830
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,100
Besides, I think you could help me to be a better person.

831
00:50:31,101 --> 00:50:34,395
<i>Besides, uh, uh...</i>

832
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:39,468
Uh...
I mean, um...

833
00:50:39,470 --> 00:50:42,008
I think you could help me
be a better person.

834
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:43,736
<i>You know?</i>
How do you mean?

835
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:45,975
Well, uh...

836
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,976
Um... like be grateful for what I have.

837
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:53,016
Like be thankful
for what I have.

838
00:50:53,017 --> 00:50:55,717
Sh-show some gratitude.
Show 'em some attitude!

839
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,519
Gratitude.

840
00:50:57,521 --> 00:50:59,999
Gratitude.

841
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:01,360
Gratitude.

842
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:13,536
- Wow, she's really beautiful.
- You're really beautiful.

843
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,109
What'd you say?

844
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:23,479
Did you say

01:03:28,705 --> 01:03:29,995
You can change your mind.

1015
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,240
You can change your mind.

1016
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:33,611
That's okay.

1017
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:41,716
Hey, ash, can we talk
for a second? I got...

1018
01:03:41,718 --> 01:03:44,318
Mmm.
Thank you.

1019
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:48,057
Excuse me.

1020
01:03:48,058 --> 01:03:50,628
This cake...
Was terrible.

1021
01:03:52,462 --> 01:03:55,172
You didn't like it?
Oh, it was terrible.

1022
01:03:55,173 --> 01:03:57,665
Oh, I'm so sorry, Ashley.

1023
01:03:57,667 --> 01:03:59,997
Do I know you?
We go to school together. I'm Miranda.

1024
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,470
Do I know you?
We go to school together. I'm Miranda.

1025
01:04:01,471 --> 01:04:05,040
Good.
Can you get me your manager? Thanks.

1026
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:09,745
<i>I'll just, uh,</i>
<i>pay for it myself.</i>

1027
01:04:09,746 --> 01:04:11,746
Loser.

1028
01:04:11,748 --> 01:04:15,087
What makes her a loser?
Nothing. She just is a loser.

1029
01:04:15,088 --> 01:04:18,615
Oh, then what would make her a winner?
Hello? Nothing.

1030
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:21,221
Okay, a tiger can't
just change his spots.

1031
01:04:21,224 --> 01:04:24,334
<i>All right? I mean,</i>
<i>just be glad that you're a winner...</i>

1032
01:04:24,335 --> 01:04:28,097
Like me.

1033
01:04:30,767 --> 01:04:33,067
What? What?

1034
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,407
She is a fatty, round
little waitress, okay?

1035
01:04:35,408 --> 01:04:39,505
- You tell me what could make her become a winner?
- Okay, I'll tell you how.

1036
01:04:39,509 --> 01:04:41,609
- Tell me.
- I will. - Tell me.

1037
01:04:41,611 --> 01:04:44,011
I will, if you'd stop your petty, little,
self-important whining...

1038
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:46,148
<i>For just one second.</i>

1039
01:04:46,149 --> 01:04:49,549
You know what?
I can't do this anymore.

1040
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:53,989
Is this because of the cake?
Because I didn't like the cake?

1041
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:56,690
You know what? I-I'm sorry.
I loved the cake.

1042
01:04:56,693 --> 01:04:59,999
Everyone, I loved the cake.
Could you try the cake? No, it's not the cake.

1043
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,060
Everyone, I loved the cake.
Could you try the cake? No, it's not the cake.

1044
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:04,433
It's not the cake, Ashley.
Then I don't understand what you're so upset about.

1045
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:07,574
I know you don't, and that's the goddamn of it,
is that you really don't know.

1046
01:05:07,575 --> 01:05:10,139
But then you said so yourself:

1047
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:13,110
"A tiger
can't change his spots."

1048
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:19,375
<i>Brian... I'm scared.</i>

1049
01:05:19,382 --> 01:05:22,384
Yeah, look,
here's five for the cake.

1050
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,515
Five to buy a clue.
This is over.

1051
01:05:24,521 --> 01:05:26,755
Brian.
Brian.

1052
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,996
I love you, Brian Ryan!
"I love you."

1053
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:32,000
I love you, Brian Ryan!
"I love you."

1054
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:38,374
So, when's the wedding?
Yeah, you picked out your dress yet?

1055
01:05:38,375 --> 01:05:41,498
Shit.
You fags be ready come prom night...

1056
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:43,442
For the Chris Campbell
nail-and-bail.

1057
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:47,409
Nice rhyme.
Did you make that up all by yourself?

1058
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,678
I'll catch you guys later, okay?

1059
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,348
Yeah, all right.
Right on.

1060
01:05:53,349 --> 01:05:55,384
So...

1061
01:05:55,385 --> 01:05:59,115
So, how does this work anyway?
The old nail-and-bail?

1062
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,002
Like you don't know? I saw grant this morning,
blubbering like a whale.

1063
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:03,328
Like you don't know? I saw grant this morning,
blubbering like a whale.

1064
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:05,596
So?
So, you didn't try to sleep with her?

1065
01:06:05,597 --> 01:06:08,425
It wasn't like that.
You see, it is like that.

1066
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:13,435
No, it isn't, because you never cared about Maggie.
Neither did you.

1067
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:15,166
I cared about her.

1068
01:06:15,171 --> 01:06:20,211
Don't look so surprised.
Nail-and-bail has crushed greater chicks than Carter.

1069
01:06:20,212 --> 01:06:24,379
There is not a chance in hell Maggie sleeps with you.
She's better than that!

1070
01:06:24,380 --> 01:06:27,319
Maybe she used to be,
but then you stepped in and changed all that.

1071
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,997
- Didn't you, Brian?
- It is Ryan! It's not Brian!

1072
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:30,620
- Didn't you, Brian?
- It is Ryan! It's not Brian!

1073
01:06:30,621 --> 01:06:34,060
It doesn't really matter,
does it?

1074
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:41,261
Get in that box now,
sue Ann!

1075
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:44,604
Have you seen Maggie?
I'm not talking to you, Jack hole!

1076
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:49,338
Well, well, well,
what have we got here?

1077
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:51,308
Someone trying out some pants?

1078
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:54,576
Listen, you can be pissed at me if you want to,
that's fine.

1079
01:06:54,577 --> 01:06:57,107
<i>I deserve it.</i>

1080
01:06:57,113 --> 01:06:59,999
Just tell me if you've seen her.

1081
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,280
Just tell me if you've seen her.

1082
01:07:00,283 --> 01:07:03,153
<i>Not since you scared her off,
bird-dogging for sniff.</i>

1083
01:07:03,154 --> 01:07:06,292
What is this,
some ladies' afternoon tea?

1084
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:14,696
Walk it off.

1085
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,040
What are you guys doing
at my house?

1086
01:07:23,041 --> 01:07:26,308
What happened between you and Ashley?
Is there someone else?

1087
01:07:26,309 --> 01:07:28,209
Was it the hair on her back?

1088
01:07:28,211 --> 01:07:30,001
'Cause she is getting that removed.
Uh, that hair.

1089
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:32,520
'Cause she is getting that removed.
Uh, that hair.

1090
01:07:32,521 --> 01:07:35,284
Isn't there anything
that she can do?

1091
01:07:35,285 --> 01:07:40,015
Look, short of camping on my lawn and begging profusely, no.

1092
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:26,540
I cut out today and bought it.

1093
01:08:26,541 --> 01:08:29,266
For prom.

1094
01:08:29,272 --> 01:08:30,002
What do you think?
Yeah? I think it's great.

1095
01:08:30,003 --> 01:08:32,540
What do you think?
Yeah? I think it's great.

1096
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:36,478
I mean, it's... perfect.

1097
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,448
Do you think Chris will like it?

1098
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,679
You know...

1099
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:45,654
Are you sure about him?

1100
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:47,685
I mean, are you really sure?

1101
01:08:47,690 --> 01:08:51,390
What are you talking about?
Chris.

1102
01:08:53,062 --> 01:08:57,332
I wanted Ashley grant.
So?

1103
01:08:57,333 --> 01:08:59,473
So I told him
what to say to you.

1104
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:04,671
The e-mails,
the nursing home,

1105
01:09:04,674 --> 01:09:08,314
<i>and he helped me out
with Ashley.</i>

1106
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,181
I'm sorry, Maggie.

1107
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:18,249
I don't believe you.

1108
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:22,357
Look, when you're alone
with him, face-to-face,

1109
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:26,058
does he ever say anything clever
or funny or even sincere?

1110
01:09:26,062 --> 01:09:30,002
He's shy. <i>No, he's not shy, Maggie,</i>
<i>he's a dumb ass.</i>

1111
01:09:32,068 --> 01:09:35,604
In the theater,
I said you were beautiful. Me!

1112
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:39,335
<i>I meant it...</i>

1113
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:43,012
Because...
I have feelings for you.

1114
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,154
You're really pathetic,
do you know that?

1115
01:09:47,155 --> 01:09:49,217
Maggie, I...
<i>No.</i>

1116
01:09:49,218 --> 01:09:52,688
I'm sorry if things didn't work out for you,
but do you think...

1117
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:56,229
You could just tear me and Chris down
because Ashley grant broke up with you?

1118
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:59,725
Maggie, listen, I...
<i>No, because honestly...</i>

1119
01:09:59,729 --> 01:09:59,999
I don't even see that guy you
used to be anymore, Ryan.

1120
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,370
I don't even see that guy you
used to be anymore, Ryan.

1121
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,398
I see a liar.

1122
01:10:09,672 --> 01:10:12,012
Brian.

1123
01:10:27,757 --> 01:10:29,587
If you run your mascara,
it's gonna look really bad.

1124
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:44,042
Would one of you whores
please give me a tissue?

1125
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:50,176
<i>Oh,</i>
<i>you can see her... oh, it's a twosome.</i>

1126
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,479
<i>They're gonna get it on.
Oh, it's a threesome.</i>

1127
01:10:52,482 --> 01:10:56,518
Hey, did you guys hear
the theme for the prom?

1128
01:10:56,519 --> 01:10:59,999
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
"Titanic dreams."

1129
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,160
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.
"Titanic dreams."

1130
01:11:00,161 --> 01:11:03,186
What? Those people died!

1131
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:07,329
True.
But they have become legends.

1132
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:10,700
Yeah. <i>Like your idol,</i>
<i>Virgil Doolittle.</i>

1133
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:25,247
<i>Take me to the prom!</i>

1134
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:29,188
<i>Take me to the prom!</i>

1135
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:39,694
Please, take me to the prom!

1136
01:11:39,695 --> 01:11:42,264
Fine, just go home.

1137
01:11:42,265 --> 01:11:46,434
Okay. Thank you.

1138
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:51,035
<i>I want everything tonight to be as beautiful as you look.</i>

1139
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:55,210
Dinner, prom, the hotel.

1140
01:11:58,548 --> 01:11:59,998
Aren't puppies cute?

1141
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,590
Aren't puppies cute?

1142
01:12:02,591 --> 01:12:04,585
Get out of here, man.

1143
01:12:04,587 --> 01:12:07,317
So, I wonder where ash
went tonight.

1144
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,292
- Is she not going to prom?
- She's going with Brian.

1145
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:13,361
Yeah,
she was crawling on her knees for him.

1146
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:15,302
<i>Can you blame her though?</i>

1147
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:18,028
Brian rocks.
<i>Give me a break.</i>

1148
01:12:18,034 --> 01:12:21,144
He's a geek.
Tell 'em, Maggie.

1149
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:29,997
I heard he plays the accordion.

1150
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:30,550
I heard he plays the accordion.

1151
01:12:34,517 --> 01:12:37,217
To prom!
To prom!

1152
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:56,069
<i>Go, go, go, go.</i>

1153
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:58,472
<i>Hey,</i>
<i>watch the threads. Ouch.</i>

1154
01:13:01,277 --> 01:13:03,507
I can't believe
we don't have dates.

1155
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:06,548
I do.
You've got a date?

1156
01:13:06,549 --> 01:13:09,389
Well, you don't know her.
She's recently divorced.

1157
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,220
Okay.

1158
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,992
What?
Sure, cosmo.

1159

Twenty bucks. Cool!
I'll go get my purse.

do you know how much you owe me?

1358
01:29:39,007 --> 01:29:41,177
