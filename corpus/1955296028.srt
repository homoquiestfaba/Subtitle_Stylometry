00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:48,223
<i>Some believe that Eve
was the first woman... -</i>

3
00:00:48,458 --> 00:00:50,757
<i>born of The Garden of Eden-</i>

4
00:01:00,506 --> 00:01:03,101
<i>Others believe
there was another... -</i>

5
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:06,312
<i>created flawed, imperfect... -</i>

6
00:01:06,646 --> 00:01:10,414
<i>from a substance most vile-</i>

7
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,096
<i>Her name is Lilith-</i>

8
00:01:24,504 --> 00:01:26,439
<i>She believed she was
Adam's equal-</i>

9
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:28,265
<i>Would not lie beneath him-</i>

10
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:31,305
<i>For this, she was cast out-</i>

11
00:01:34,249 --> 00:01:36,275
<i>Cursed for eternity... -</i>

12
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:40,353
<i>she became something else... -</i>

13
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:50,595
<i>Her killings were relentless-</i>

14
00:01:59,716 --> 00:02:01,377
<i>The Faith was formed... -</i>

15
00:02:01,718 --> 00:02:03,744
<i>to end Lilith's wrath-</i>

16
00:02:04,021 --> 00:02:06,992
Each of you is part
of that same Order.

17
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,452
<i>Together, we will
fight Lilith... -</i>

18
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,755
<i>and all her kind-</i>

19
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:29,408
<i>- Prefect?
- Yes, Chapel?</i>

20
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:33,147
Why does God allow
such evil to exist?

21
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,855
You ask an eternal
question.

22
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:38,964
One that will follow you
throughout your life.

23
00:02:39,235 --> 00:02:41,100
But one thing is certain...

24
00:02:41,637 --> 00:02:44,765
the mysteries of this world...

25
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:48,039
will be solved in the next.

26
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:02,718
While we live here...

27
00:03:02,963 --> 00:03:05,593
we must put our faith
in the Creator's plan.

28
00:03:06,602 --> 00:03:08,662
<i>So, Prefect... -</i>

29
00:03:09,538 --> 00:03:12,337
the Creator planned
what happened to my parents?

30
00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:24,623
<i>One day
you will not question... -</i>

31
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,829
why your parents
were taken from this world.

32
00:03:28,196 --> 00:03:31,634
You must find meaning in
what has happened to you.

33
00:03:31,902 --> 00:03:34,427
You must grow, evolve...

34
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:36,367
and overcome.

35
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:46,348
<i>Every life has a purpose
and a plan-</i>

36
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:50,080
<i>The Faith has fought Lilith
and her brethren for centuries-</i>

37
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:52,716
<i>But one day... -</i>

38
00:03:52,996 --> 00:03:56,397
<i>one day, we will stop her-</i>

39
00:04:19,062 --> 00:04:20,620
No! Wait!

40
00:04:21,465 --> 00:04:23,593
Put the restraints on her!
Now!

41
00:04:32,712 --> 00:04:34,078
You have succeeded.

42
00:04:34,382 --> 00:04:36,851
Not until I've watched
her draw her last breath.

43
00:04:37,119 --> 00:04:39,418
She will not die today.
I forbid it!

44
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:42,053
Prefect, I thought our duty
was to end her wrath.

45
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:45,888
- And we have!
- The Faith exists to eliminate her!

46
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:48,599
She has to pay
for the lives she's taken.

47
00:04:48,934 --> 00:04:51,732
- We're not killers, Shaw.
- This is wrong!

48
00:04:52,739 --> 00:04:55,334
My decision is final.

49
00:04:56,311 --> 00:04:58,336
<i>The matter is closed!
The Raeborne Team received... -</i>

50
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:15,562
<i>the "Starker Prize" for pioneering
research that extends human life-</i>

51
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:19,533
<i>Former member, Anders Raeborne
was expelled in a major scandal... -</i>

52
00:05:19,808 --> 00:05:22,403
<i>for testing dangerous substances
on humans-</i>

53
00:05:22,678 --> 00:05:24,873
<i>Son of team leader
Cyrus Raeborne... -</i>

54
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:27,742
<i>Anders has not been heard from
in over a year-</i>

55
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:30,783
<i>His whereabouts are unknown-</i>

56
00:05:38,665 --> 00:05:40,293
Lies.

57
00:06:25,558 --> 00:06:27,254
Silence!

58
00:06:40,377 --> 00:06:41,901
It's pure.

59
00:06:45,117 --> 00:06:48,815
No one believed that I could
accomplish this, except you.

60
00:06:49,188 --> 00:06:52,216
This time, there are no
side-effects.

61
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:53,926
It's flawless.

62
00:06:54,428 --> 00:06:56,055
I tested it myself.

63
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:14,446
Do it!

64
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,074
We've conquered
the valley of death.

65
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,079
Immortality.

66
00:08:05,153 --> 00:08:06,677
Put it to the test.

67
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:22,064
Again.

68
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:34,214
Still alive.

69
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:22,243
True immortality
wears a different face, Anders.

70
00:09:22,453 --> 00:09:24,114
You're more than human.

71
00:09:24,489 --> 00:09:26,515
You're a Demonicos.

72
00:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,123
Your destiny awaits.

73
00:09:29,728 --> 00:09:31,594
I'll be watching.

74
00:09:33,401 --> 00:09:34,629
Now, go.

75
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:53,984
Go, go!

76
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,544
I've located agent Geresh.

77
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:21,018
He had this.

78
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:30,035
Prefect, an Agent has been murdered.
Our security breached.

79
00:10:30,273 --> 00:10:32,538
Someone is tampering
with Darklight.

80
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:39,312
The prophecy has begun.

81
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,381
Maltheus 6: "And the Demonicos...

82
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:45,489
shall carry a Red Plague...

83
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:47,126
sweeping the earth...

84
00:10:47,429 --> 00:10:49,660
smiting mankind."

85
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:53,299
Then we only have a few days
before it's too late.

86
00:10:55,306 --> 00:10:57,069
Her time has come.

87
00:11:53,013 --> 00:11:54,037
<i>Elle-</i>

88
00:12:20,616 --> 00:12:22,049
<i>"Each mark carries the curse... -</i>

89
00:12:22,285 --> 00:12:24,754
<i>that the bearer shall suffer
for all of eternity-"</i>

90
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:25,700
- I smell trouble.
- What?

91
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:27,629
I'm just bringing you flowers.

92
00:13:28,036 --> 00:13:29,902
There's no trouble in that,
is there?

93
00:13:30,172 --> 00:13:33,143
With you, Elle,
I never can tell.

94
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:41,018
Are you all right?

95
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:48,125
Abe, what do you know
about biblical curses?

96
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:51,223
<i>Not a darn thing-</i>

97
00:13:52,502 --> 00:13:53,526
<i>Why? -</i>

98
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:58,039
There's something called "The marks
of Daggoth". I read about it.

99
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:02,377
Elle, why do you do this
to yourself?

100
00:14:02,914 --> 00:14:06,408
It's been three years since
I took you off the streets...

101
00:14:06,653 --> 00:14:09,247
- a vagrant.
- And I'm grateful for it.

102
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:11,389
Elle, listen to me.

103
00:14:11,893 --> 00:14:13,828
You need to focus on...

104
00:14:14,096 --> 00:14:18,032
building a new life,
here and now.

105
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,695
Now you got a new job.
What about that?

106
00:14:22,939 --> 00:14:25,875
You call working
at a flower shop a job?

107
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,007
I call it a start.

108
00:14:29,281 --> 00:14:31,944
I have to find out who I am.

109
00:14:34,321 --> 00:14:38,019
Elle, you may not want
to know everything.

110
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:40,694
You've got a clean slate...

111
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,891
something most people
just dream about.

112
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,435
Use it!

113
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:54,546
It's not so easy.

114
00:14:55,314 --> 00:14:57,613
Yeah... I'm trying
to figure it out.

115
00:15:08,599 --> 00:15:10,567
<i>Let us now,
pray for this child... -</i>

116
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:13,430
<i>who is to receive the sacrament
of new birth-</i>

117
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:16,971
<i>Deliver him, oh Lord... -</i>

118
00:15:17,275 --> 00:15:18,903
<i>Open his heart
to Your grace... -</i>

119
00:15:19,145 --> 00:15:22,981
<i>- This is Shaw.
- Shaw, I need your help-</i>

120
00:15:23,418 --> 00:15:25,979
<i>The Faith is in trouble-
We need to meet-</i>

121
00:15:26,255 --> 00:15:29,589
- Marcus, slow down. What's wrong?
- Someone has committed sabotage.

122
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,852
- You're the only one I can trust.
- Right, Marcus. Where are you?

123
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:35,895
Loading Dock 44. The Toschko Plant.
Do you know where that is?

124
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:39,103
Yes, I know where that is.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

125
00:16:00,933 --> 00:16:03,697
- Is there some place we can talk?
- I don't think it's a good idea.

126
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,668
Jenn, please,
just give me a chance.

127
00:16:09,978 --> 00:16:12,037
It's Conner's fourteenth
birthday.

128
00:16:13,548 --> 00:16:17,816
I know. Will, why did you come
today?

129
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:22,889
Our marriage is over.
You still haven't moved on.

130
00:16:23,228 --> 00:16:24,457
Conner is gone.

131
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,664
I didn't come for the lecture.

132
00:16:26,966 --> 00:16:29,594
I just came to give you this.

133
00:16:30,104 --> 00:16:32,095
It's for your newborn.

134
00:16:33,241 --> 00:16:34,971
Congratulations!

135
00:16:36,546 --> 00:16:37,808
Will?

136
00:16:41,619 --> 00:16:44,282
I really have to go.

137
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,504
<i>Marcus!</i>

138
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:11,180
- Marcus!
- Shaw.

139
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,051
Who did this to you?

140
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:15,252
Marcus?

141
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,059
I'm open! I'm open!

142
00:19:03,835 --> 00:19:07,671
Are you all right?
I swear I couldn't stop!

143
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:11,772
Don't worry about it.
I'm fine.

144
00:21:35,331 --> 00:21:38,325
Dr. Hardwick is one of the four
Raeborne Team members...

145
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:42,198
who have revolutionized our
understanding of human mortality.

146
00:21:42,606 --> 00:21:44,734
We're pleased to have you
on this broadcast.

147
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,102
Thank you.

148
00:21:46,411 --> 00:21:49,814
Tell me, where does
your Team's discovery take us?

149
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:52,746
Can we extend
the human life span...

150
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:54,580
to 150 years?

151
00:21:55,156 --> 00:21:56,521
Oh Jerry...

152
00:21:56,826 --> 00:22:00,024
we're a long way
from an advance like that.

153
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:04,297
We've simply provided
a road map to...

154
00:22:07,907 --> 00:22:11,206
See? This is what happens
when you cut the budget, Ray!

155
00:22:11,511 --> 00:22:13,479
I'm terribly sorry!

156
00:22:50,527 --> 00:22:52,257
Are you ok?

157
00:22:53,931 --> 00:22:55,524
Yeah.

158
00:22:57,503 --> 00:22:59,767
It's just a rash.
It's nothing.

159
00:23:09,652 --> 00:23:11,314
<i>All medical units
be advised... -</i>

160
00:23:11,554 --> 00:23:14,183
<i>there are unconfirmed reports
of a highly contagious virus-</i>

161
00:23:14,524 --> 00:23:17,084
<i>Patients with rash like symptoms
should be immediately taken... -</i>

162
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,091
<i>to the nearest King's Point
Care Center-</i>

163
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:59,210
Marcus is dead.

164
00:24:00,116 --> 00:24:04,111
- Murdered.
- I promise there'll be retribution.

165
00:24:04,523 --> 00:24:06,389
But there's something
more pressing.

166
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,389
A Demonicos is loose.

167
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:10,755
And it's carrying
the Red Plague.

168
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:13,796
So, we'll handle it like
we handled other one.

169
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:16,936
The Talis won't work.
It's immune.

170
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:29,514
Go to King's Point, William.
Contact Lilith. Train her.

171
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:33,923
- You're not serious!
- She's the only weapon we have.

172
00:24:36,463 --> 00:24:39,433
What you're asking
is something I can't do.

173
00:24:39,968 --> 00:24:42,699
Can't or won't?

174
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:55,750
Is this really wise, Prefect?

175
00:24:56,022 --> 00:24:57,819
See to it.

176
00:25:09,105 --> 00:25:12,371
Why is she still alive?

177
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,509
Who are we to question why?

178
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,911
If only you had killed her
when you had the chance.

179
00:25:45,553 --> 00:25:47,488
- Come in.
- Thank you.

180
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:52,784
I need to speak with her right away.
Is she here?

181
00:25:53,029 --> 00:25:54,622
She's gone.

182
00:25:56,133 --> 00:25:59,593
She fled again.
I don't know where she went.

183
00:26:00,172 --> 00:26:02,697
You might try Abel Gardens.

184
00:26:03,709 --> 00:26:05,678
She goes there often.

185
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:11,274
Makes sense, because it was us
who placed her there.

186
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:15,819
Yeah.
Thank you.

187
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:19,726
Be careful.
She's confused.

188
00:26:20,265 --> 00:26:22,426
Going through changes.

189
00:26:23,502 --> 00:26:26,369
I'm not sure
what she's capable of.

190
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,761
You need practice.

191
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:54,434
I'm not interest in company
or conversation...

192
00:26:54,676 --> 00:26:58,009
- in case you didn't notice it.
- Just a moment of your time.

193
00:27:00,416 --> 00:27:03,147
Do you know why you have
those marks on your arm?

194
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:07,351
You don't remember anything before
you woke up here three years ago.

195
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:09,823
It's public record. If you're
trying to scare me, don't bother.

196
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,997
It's public record
because we staged it that way.

197
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:18,670
Have you ever heard
the name "Lilith"?

198
00:27:22,278 --> 00:27:24,473
An old legend
from the Garden of Eden.

199
00:27:24,714 --> 00:27:26,740
She was Adam's first wife.

200
00:27:27,284 --> 00:27:29,014
An immortal.

201
00:27:29,721 --> 00:27:32,713
She was cursed and became
a demon out for revenge.

202
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,292
- What's that got to do with me?
- The legend is true.

203
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:40,298
Lilith curse is known...

204
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,799
by the five Marks of Daggoth...

205
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:45,433
on her wrist.

206
00:27:45,909 --> 00:27:48,902
Everything you know
about yourself is false.

207
00:27:50,147 --> 00:27:52,479
You took the name "Elle"
because it was the only letter...

208
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,549
that you could remember
from your real name.

209
00:27:56,455 --> 00:27:58,754
You have no memory...

210
00:27:59,025 --> 00:28:01,825
because you have
this substance...

211
00:28:02,129 --> 00:28:03,758
inside you.

212
00:28:04,032 --> 00:28:05,727
It's blocking out
the past.

213
00:28:06,099 --> 00:28:09,161
Why would I believe you?
I don't even know who you are.

214
00:28:09,806 --> 00:28:11,433
My name is William Shaw.

215
00:28:11,741 --> 00:28:14,711
I work for an organization.

216
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:17,148
It's called The Faith.

217
00:28:18,016 --> 00:28:21,646
And I need your help.
I know all of this sounds crazy...

218
00:28:22,087 --> 00:28:24,080
but there's something out there
called the Demonicos...

219
00:28:24,357 --> 00:28:27,328
and in a few days,
all that you care about...

220
00:28:27,596 --> 00:28:29,393
will become meaningless.

221
00:28:29,932 --> 00:28:32,127
And you're the only one
that can stop it.

222
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:35,269
I think you've got
the wrong girl, William.

223
00:28:36,173 --> 00:28:38,836
I'm not going to go out there
and fight some evil.

224
00:28:39,778 --> 00:28:42,576
I can't even hold down
a minimum wage job.

225
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,049
I've got real problems.

226
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:48,383
You can't run away from this.

227
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:51,885
It will catch up with you.

228
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:21,826
I know that mind of yours
is still functional, Anders.

229
00:29:22,066 --> 00:29:25,696
So I'm certain you'll grasp the
importance of what I'll tell you.

230
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:29,072
The one person out there
who can kill you, Lilith...

231
00:29:29,341 --> 00:29:31,435
is now hunting you.

232
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:33,905
I suggest you strike first.

233
00:29:44,962 --> 00:29:46,395
Abe?

234
00:30:02,819 --> 00:30:04,582
Run!

235
00:31:14,978 --> 00:31:17,038
Things got a nasty bite.

236
00:31:17,381 --> 00:31:19,816
- Am I dying?
- Not yet.

237
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:24,149
This will neutralize the Talis
in your bloodstream.

238
00:31:24,458 --> 00:31:26,618
Accelerate your ability
to heal.

239
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,386
Now, just rest. Save your strength.
We've got some catching up to do.

240
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,464
Here.

241
00:32:15,655 --> 00:32:17,681
What did you shoot into me?

242
00:32:20,562 --> 00:32:23,225
I removed the Talis that's been
clogging your body.

243
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:25,434
This is what it looks like
in solid form.

244
00:32:25,702 --> 00:32:29,536
It's bark from a tree.
Dates back to the Garden of Eden.

245
00:32:31,441 --> 00:32:33,137
Here.

246
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:37,815
<i>Abe was one of us-
He believe in your potential-</i>

247
00:32:39,554 --> 00:32:42,284
- What do you want me to do?
- Prove him right.

248
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:44,286
You have extraordinary gifts.

249
00:32:44,593 --> 00:32:46,527
You can either use them
to help...

250
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:49,995
or watch everyone around you dead.
It's your choice.

251
00:32:52,204 --> 00:32:54,194
Show me what I'd have to do.

252
00:32:56,908 --> 00:33:00,208
In order to use it, you have to
understand the source of your power.

253
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,609
It's called "Darklight".
An energy as old as the universe.

254
00:33:03,851 --> 00:33:07,446
It's what you're made of.
It's what makes you unique.

255
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:09,982
It's the reason why
your wounds always heal.

256
00:33:10,226 --> 00:33:11,922
And it makes you damn
near invincible.

257
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:15,256
You're going to go through physical
changes. Not all of them pleasant.

258
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:17,593
You'd better prepare yourself.

259
00:33:30,885 --> 00:33:33,651
You're not hurt.
Now focus.

260
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:35,857
Your instincts will take over.

261
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,083
Ok.

262
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:59,055
So, other than Talis,
nothing can hurt me.

263
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:02,121
Exactly.
Next lesson.

264
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,301
Sometimes there's
nowhere to run.

265
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:18,535
You have to read the situation
and improvise.

266
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:42,108
I warned you.

267
00:35:07,478 --> 00:35:10,140
- You like it down there?
- Not bad.

268
00:35:10,448 --> 00:35:12,608
But don't get overconfident.

269
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:17,020
Now, let's go.

270
00:35:17,724 --> 00:35:19,555
We have our first appointment.

271
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:35,645
We're here to see
Dr. Katherine Hardwick's body.

272
00:35:36,816 --> 00:35:39,579
The director is out sick,
like the rest of the staff.

273
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:42,482
- Can you come back tomorrow?
- No, that won't do.

274
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,755
We have to see her right now.

275
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,855
Ok. Follow me.

276
00:36:05,885 --> 00:36:07,216
Here she is.

277
00:36:11,893 --> 00:36:16,696
We should get the first
test results back tonight.

278
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,378
No, no!
Don't touch it!

279
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,858
Where are the others?

280
00:37:03,994 --> 00:37:06,361
<i>- We need to go-
- If it's this contagious...</i>

281
00:37:06,597 --> 00:37:08,532
everybody who has touched
these bodies, could be infected.

282
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:12,727
- They could be spreading it by now.
- You catch on quick.

283
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,267
<i>How bad is this thing?</i>

284
00:37:14,507 --> 00:37:16,442
<i>Heard of the Black Plague?
The Middle Ages?</i>

285
00:37:16,677 --> 00:37:19,169
<i>Think of something
a hundred times worse-</i>

286
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:22,775
<i>- What is it?
- I have to stop-</i>

287
00:37:31,529 --> 00:37:33,430
What's wrong with your hand?

288
00:37:35,235 --> 00:37:39,469
Will, are you ok?

289
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:45,903
It happens sometimes.
I can't control it.

290
00:37:46,149 --> 00:37:47,844
How long have you had it?

291
00:37:48,384 --> 00:37:50,080
Since my son died.

292
00:37:50,521 --> 00:37:53,252
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- I don't want to talk about it.

293
00:38:02,169 --> 00:38:03,728
I have news.

294
00:38:03,972 --> 00:38:06,441
Shaw has begun his work
with Lilith.

295
00:38:06,809 --> 00:38:08,607
But the Red Plague...

296
00:38:09,111 --> 00:38:10,908
is spreading.

297
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:18,316
Please, sit.

298
00:38:25,064 --> 00:38:28,194
This is difficult for me...

299
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:30,097
but it's time
you know the truth.

300
00:38:30,373 --> 00:38:34,435
There has always been a link
between you and Lilith.

301
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:39,242
The day your parents died
was a Faith mission...

302
00:38:39,852 --> 00:38:42,320
gone terribly wrong.

303
00:38:44,223 --> 00:38:48,184
We didn't know that a boy
had survived the fight...

304
00:38:50,331 --> 00:38:52,129
and managed to find us.

305
00:38:55,071 --> 00:38:59,840
It was our pursuit of Lilith, that
caused the death of your parents.

306
00:39:02,047 --> 00:39:04,641
By not telling you the truth
until now...

307
00:39:06,252 --> 00:39:08,243
I was trying to protect you.

308
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,749
I did know...

309
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:15,792
even though you never told me.

310
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,625
But you did teach me
about the human spirit...

311
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:22,964
and how it can overcome
the greatest of the tragedies.

312
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:28,705
I have learned not to question
why things happen.

313
00:39:29,883 --> 00:39:31,509
Through faith...

314
00:39:32,418 --> 00:39:33,977
and prayer...

315
00:39:35,389 --> 00:39:37,153
I have found strength.

316
00:39:39,862 --> 00:39:42,889
<i>More strength
than you can imagine-</i>

317
00:39:50,676 --> 00:39:52,473
Today I am proud to announce...

318
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:56,079
the formation of
Raeborne Life Industries.

319
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:57,510
A private entity
established to turn...

320
00:39:57,818 --> 00:40:01,413
the Raeborne Team's research...

321
00:40:01,689 --> 00:40:04,181
into new antiaging drugs.

322
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:07,518
The revolution in
extending human life...

323
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,527
is just beginning.

324
00:40:11,702 --> 00:40:14,262
I'm certain the late
Dr. Hardwick...

325
00:40:14,572 --> 00:40:18,339
would want us to continue
this pioneering work.

326
00:40:19,445 --> 00:40:22,006
Now I'd like to present
this short video.

327
00:40:22,984 --> 00:40:25,418
<i>The Fountain of Youth:
Does it exist?</i>

328
00:40:25,686 --> 00:40:27,017
<i>The Raeborne Team
has made discoveries... -</i>

329
00:40:27,288 --> 00:40:31,090
<i>that one day, will lead us
to the well-spring of eternal life-</i>

330
00:40:56,726 --> 00:40:59,924
<i>Attention, all units- Wild animal
loose at the Jasmin Hotel-</i>

331
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:02,167
<i>Numerous casualties
are reported-</i>

332
00:41:02,434 --> 00:41:05,871
<i>- All units respond-
- Game time!</i>

333
00:41:09,742 --> 00:41:11,608
Move, move, move!

334
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:13,475
Let's go! Let's go!

335
00:41:43,721 --> 00:41:45,986
Where is everybody?

336
00:41:47,459 --> 00:41:49,222
Let's go!

337
00:42:05,382 --> 00:42:06,713
Stay with me.

338
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:20,525
I don't understand.
Why come here?

339
00:42:20,968 --> 00:42:23,837
What's so special about
Raeborne Life Industries?

340
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,442
Quiet. It's here.

341
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,112
Now remember, your Darklight
is the only thing that can kill it.

342
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,714
- Get in close to be effective.
- What if it gets me first?

343
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:36,918
Focus. Just trust
in the training.

344
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:39,549
Now, you head up top.
I'll stay here...

345
00:42:39,827 --> 00:42:41,920
and draw it out.

346
00:43:43,074 --> 00:43:44,303
Get up!

347
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:20,922
Wait!

348
00:44:21,724 --> 00:44:25,685
- Or he dies.
- What do you want?

349
00:44:27,966 --> 00:44:29,958
Why do you fight me?

350
00:44:31,371 --> 00:44:35,831
This Shaw, he wants to kill you.

351
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:38,910
He used Talis against you.

352
00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:42,584
He hates you with all his will.

353
00:44:43,186 --> 00:44:45,849
You and I are of the same blood.

354
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:49,518
I'm not like you.

355
00:44:49,794 --> 00:44:52,423
So many innocents were killed...

356
00:44:54,501 --> 00:44:56,298
by your hand.

357
00:45:27,176 --> 00:45:29,110
- You didn't tell me.
- Elle...

358
00:45:29,345 --> 00:45:33,248
No, my name is not Elle.
It's Lilith, remember?

359
00:45:34,118 --> 00:45:38,216
You put that thing in my neck.
You tried to kill me, didn't you?

360
00:45:41,495 --> 00:45:45,159
That's right.
Because you murdered my son.

361
00:45:47,603 --> 00:45:51,404
- I don't remember your son.
- That makes one of us.

362
00:45:52,341 --> 00:45:55,369
Let's just do this.
End it now.

363
00:45:57,514 --> 00:46:00,917
I don't want to kill you.
I just want answers.

364
00:46:03,022 --> 00:46:04,615
Ok?

365
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,715
Let's go.

366
00:46:42,751 --> 00:46:44,844
<i>There will be no turning back-</i>

367
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:55,655
These samples could be enough
to create a vaccine for us.

368
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,866
I take it you received the book.

369
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:04,201
- That was from you?
- Yes.

370
00:47:04,671 --> 00:47:07,265
Are you now ready
to reclaim the past?

371
00:47:07,506 --> 00:47:08,837
Yeah.

372
00:47:13,179 --> 00:47:14,270
Follow me.

373
00:47:41,904 --> 00:47:43,736
Am I responsible
for all of this?

374
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:45,738
Yes.

375
00:47:46,375 --> 00:47:49,004
The world was created
from love and hope.

376
00:47:49,412 --> 00:47:51,379
Qualities which are
Divinely Ordained.

377
00:47:51,614 --> 00:47:53,979
<i>Each of us has them,
except you-</i>

378
00:48:02,258 --> 00:48:03,884
<i>You rejected paradise-</i>

379
00:48:04,091 --> 00:48:05,558
<i>You were cast out-</i>

380
00:48:05,993 --> 00:48:07,722
<i>You could never die-</i>

381
00:48:07,961 --> 00:48:10,691
<i>Darklight
raged inside of you-</i>

382
00:48:12,132 --> 00:48:14,293
<i>Your pain was all consuming-</i>

383
00:48:17,637 --> 00:48:21,232
<i>This organization was formed
to stop the evil you spread-</i>

384
00:48:21,474 --> 00:48:23,465
<i>Talis brought you down-</i>

385
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:26,307
<i>You were on the edge of death-</i>

386
00:48:26,579 --> 00:48:29,513
<i>The prefect made sure
that you were kept alive-</i>

387
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:34,582
<i>We placed you
in Abel Gardens... -</i>

388
00:48:34,853 --> 00:48:37,012
<i>knowing you would be
labeled as a transient-</i>

389
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,587
<i>When you awoke
you remembered nothing-</i>

390
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:41,619
<i>Abe was instructed... -</i>

391
00:48:41,824 --> 00:48:44,121
<i>to monitor your attempt
at a normal life-</i>

392
00:48:46,563 --> 00:48:49,258
As Elle, you may have convinced
the others...

393
00:48:49,498 --> 00:48:51,660
of your compassion
and your humanity.

394
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,128
But I still know that you are
an abomination.

395
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,934
And you'll continue to kill.

396
00:48:58,507 --> 00:49:00,770
I suggest you do
the right thing.

397
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:03,105
It's made from Talis.

398
00:49:03,578 --> 00:49:05,443
My gift to you.

399
00:50:02,831 --> 00:50:04,355
Anders?

400
00:50:07,669 --> 00:50:10,866
My lord, I need to get you
to a hospital.

401
00:50:11,106 --> 00:50:15,599
No. No hospital.
That's why I came to you.

402
00:50:26,887 --> 00:50:28,319
<i>The reason Lilith lives... -</i>

403
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:32,423
is because of the prophecy among
the most sacred of our texts...

404
00:50:32,792 --> 00:50:35,817
<i>detailing her future role
as our protector-</i>

405
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:38,752
What happened to Conner
couldn't have been Ordained.

406
00:50:38,997 --> 00:50:41,897
I don't accept that. I won't.

407
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:44,465
And yet the prophecy exists.

408
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:48,761
You must resolve this conflict
in your own mind.

409
00:50:49,041 --> 00:50:52,669
Each of us has the task
of not succumbing to the abyss.

410
00:51:23,971 --> 00:51:26,405
- Don't.
- I killed your son in cold blood.

411
00:51:26,674 --> 00:51:28,767
I'm cursed. I don't know
when I'm going to stop killing.

412
00:51:28,976 --> 00:51:31,535
- I might not, unless...
- Unless you choose not to.

413
00:51:31,813 --> 00:51:34,508
There were five marks on your arm.
Now there are four.

414
00:51:35,115 --> 00:51:39,075
Curses can be lifted, Lilith.
Even yours.

415
00:51:39,586 --> 00:51:42,419
But I killed your son.
How can you let me live?

416
00:51:42,788 --> 00:51:46,246
Because doing this
won't bring Conner back.

417
00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:50,216
What if I won't be able
to control my urges? What then?

418
00:51:50,895 --> 00:51:53,023
That will be
my responsibility.

419
00:51:53,531 --> 00:51:55,465
Give me the knife.

420
00:52:04,075 --> 00:52:06,634
Come on.
Let's go.

421
00:52:08,479 --> 00:52:09,809
We could not
create a vaccine...

422
00:52:10,048 --> 00:52:12,208
from the specimens
that agent Shaw retrieved.

423
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:15,042
We were able to construct
this model...

424
00:52:15,385 --> 00:52:17,354
from the Demonicos' DNA.

425
00:52:19,055 --> 00:52:22,582
<i>As you can see,
the brain is highly developed-</i>

426
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:25,384
This node generates the virus.

427
00:52:26,094 --> 00:52:28,563
We believe that a vaccine
can be created...

428
00:52:29,164 --> 00:52:31,792
but it requires fluid
from this portion of the brain.

429
00:52:32,433 --> 00:52:36,302
<i>- But you need the entire head-
- Exactly.</i>

430
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:40,773
There are two ways
in which the virus spread.

431
00:52:41,042 --> 00:52:42,975
The first is from
the Demonicos' bite.

432
00:52:43,278 --> 00:52:47,509
The virus is injected through
the tongue into the bloodstream.

433
00:52:47,748 --> 00:52:50,477
Without a cure, it dissolves flesh
in a matter of hours...

434
00:52:51,050 --> 00:52:52,745
resulting in death.

435
00:52:53,086 --> 00:52:56,647
The second is through contact
with an infected individual.

436
00:52:57,056 --> 00:53:00,457
Like acid, it burns through
clothing and flesh.

437
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,920
But, if you can isolate
the infected area...

438
00:53:03,328 --> 00:53:05,887
you can stop its spread.

439
00:53:07,032 --> 00:53:10,899
Contamination is rising.
The death total is 93.

440
00:53:11,169 --> 00:53:13,695
Within hours,
numerous cities will be at risk.

441
00:53:14,305 --> 00:53:16,465
The Red Plague is beginning.

442
00:53:28,317 --> 00:53:29,944
It's out there, Leo.

443
00:53:31,488 --> 00:53:33,887
And it's coming for you.

444
00:53:34,157 --> 00:53:36,317
Each one of the Raeborne Team.

445
00:53:38,594 --> 00:53:41,061
Father should have never
kicked me out.

446
00:53:41,397 --> 00:53:42,829
But the three of you...

447
00:53:43,097 --> 00:53:45,292
conspired against me...

448
00:53:45,633 --> 00:53:47,600
putting him up to it.

449
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:53,066
The Starker Award
belongs to me.

450
00:53:54,508 --> 00:53:56,204
You parade around with your...

451
00:53:56,477 --> 00:53:59,446
trappings of success,
but you're frauds.

452
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:04,414
You never revolutionized science.
I did.

453
00:54:06,919 --> 00:54:09,889
I discovered immortality.

454
00:54:17,029 --> 00:54:19,087
You want proof?

455
00:54:28,606 --> 00:54:31,404
What have you done to yourself?

456
00:54:42,118 --> 00:54:44,416
I've made fools of you all.

457
00:55:01,637 --> 00:55:03,296
<i>This area is
under martial law-</i>

458
00:55:03,537 --> 00:55:07,098
<i>You're quarantined until you prove
your identity and your health-</i>

459
00:55:08,141 --> 00:55:09,938
Get out of the car. Now.

460
00:55:31,397 --> 00:55:32,796
<i>Please remain calm-</i>

461
00:55:33,031 --> 00:55:35,363
<i>You will be arrested,
if you leave the premises-</i>

462
00:55:35,634 --> 00:55:37,863
<i>Any citizen,
showing signs of infection... -</i>

463
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:40,535
<i>will be taken
to a stage two facility-</i>

464
00:55:41,906 --> 00:55:43,463
You can't keep us here.

465
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:02,220
<i>Everyone must remain calm-</i>

466
00:56:47,966 --> 00:56:51,799
You won't survive without
another injection of Darklight.

467
00:56:53,604 --> 00:56:56,869
You did this. The virus was never
part of our agreement.

468
00:56:57,141 --> 00:56:59,734
You were the one who tampered
with Lilith strain.

469
00:57:00,011 --> 00:57:02,740
The virus is a side-effect
of your own ambition.

470
00:57:03,014 --> 00:57:04,947
- I wanted immortality, not...
- Well...

471
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,249
every wish has its price.

472
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,843
Forgot that you're human?

473
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:19,659
I'll deliver Lilith to you.
Take what you need...

474
00:57:20,093 --> 00:57:21,721
but kill her.

475
00:57:23,463 --> 00:57:25,020
They are not going to make it,
are they?

476
00:57:25,932 --> 00:57:29,060
No. And I don't think they
expect us to either.

477
00:57:29,636 --> 00:57:32,604
So try and keep the body count down
and get us out of here.

478
00:57:34,174 --> 00:57:35,902
I'll be gentle.

479
00:57:40,246 --> 00:57:42,338
<i>- Stop right there! Hold it!
- On the ground now!</i>

480
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:43,877
<i>Don't move!</i>

481
00:58:10,205 --> 00:58:11,765
Wait! Hold your fire!

482
00:58:21,482 --> 00:58:23,382
- You're with The Faith?
- Yes, sir.

483
00:58:24,786 --> 00:58:28,084
Look, The Faith saved my life
a few years ago. What do you need?

484
00:58:28,322 --> 00:58:30,916
If you can get us out of here, I got
a way to put an end to all of this.

485
00:58:31,392 --> 00:58:33,382
Alright. This way.
Stand down!

486
00:58:33,761 --> 00:58:36,229
<i>- But, sir... -
- I said stand down!</i>

487
00:58:44,903 --> 00:58:46,531
Godspeed.

488
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,679
A friend gave this to me
before he died.

489
00:58:58,549 --> 00:59:00,517
<i>There's an encrypted file
on it-</i>

490
00:59:00,952 --> 00:59:04,581
You crack the code. I think we'll
know where you came from.

491
00:59:07,157 --> 00:59:09,251
<i>- This is Shaw.
- What's the status?</i>

492
00:59:09,494 --> 00:59:11,324
I need someone
who can break code.

493
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,494
I think it will take us
to the Demonicos.

494
00:59:13,764 --> 00:59:17,097
Shaw, this is not going to be
necessary. We found its lair.

495
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,029
It's an abandoned facility
about the King's Point reservoir.

496
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:24,706
Agents are on the way.

497
00:59:28,844 --> 00:59:30,538
They're coming.

498
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:45,989
This is the place?

499
00:59:49,295 --> 00:59:52,197
It looks like the Cavalry
never came.

500
01:00:46,114 --> 01:00:47,876
Do you recognize these names?

501
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:52,677
From the morgue.
And the conference center.

502
01:00:52,919 --> 01:00:55,150
- These were not random kills.
- But why would the Demonicos...

503
01:00:55,422 --> 01:00:57,788
want them?
They were scientists.

504
01:01:01,761 --> 01:01:02,921
<i>Raeborne journal-</i>

505
01:01:03,230 --> 01:01:05,858
<i>Experiments on the test subject
caused deadly mutations-</i>

506
01:01:06,166 --> 01:01:07,656
<i>I've fixed the problems-</i>

507
01:01:07,968 --> 01:01:10,993
<i>Tomorrow, I'll prove
the world wrong-</i>

508
01:01:11,337 --> 01:01:12,635
Revenge.

509
01:01:42,899 --> 01:01:44,628
I caused all of this.

510
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:49,568
Check this out.

511
01:02:21,567 --> 01:02:24,467
Talis-tipped.
For my protection.

512
01:02:52,796 --> 01:02:55,229
Chopin was a fascinating
individual.

513
01:02:57,299 --> 01:03:00,268
He wore his beard
on the right side of his face.

514
01:03:00,769 --> 01:03:03,566
The side people saw
during his performances.

515
01:03:08,077 --> 01:03:11,706
People only see what we want them
to see, Lilith.

516
01:03:12,113 --> 01:03:13,443
Nothing more.

517
01:03:17,852 --> 01:03:19,717
Enjoy the music.

518
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:19,268
Well, I have to hand it to you,
William.

519
01:04:19,508 --> 01:04:23,307
I never thought you would turn
Lilith around. It's very impressive.

520
01:04:23,577 --> 01:04:26,012
The two of you have been
quite a thorn in my side.

521
01:04:27,148 --> 01:04:29,308
It's too bad
she's not going to make it.

522
01:04:30,117 --> 01:04:31,709
Why are you doing this?

523
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,749
There are no answers in life,
William. You should know that.

524
01:04:35,588 --> 01:04:38,216
<i>As much as I've searched,
I've found nothing-</i>

525
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:42,749
Evil not only exists in this world.
It prevails.

526
01:04:44,364 --> 01:04:48,423
The Faith has accomplished
nothing...

527
01:04:49,501 --> 01:04:53,130
except to ease the pain
and delay the inevitable.

528
01:04:54,372 --> 01:04:56,637
Remember what the Prefect
used to tell us?

529
01:04:57,342 --> 01:05:00,639
"The mysteries of this life
will be revealed in the next."

530
01:05:03,114 --> 01:05:04,512
Well...

531
01:05:05,049 --> 01:05:07,983
I am forcing the Creator's hand.

532
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:11,149
Judgment Day.

533
01:05:12,389 --> 01:05:14,754
You're sick. And you'll die
like everyone else.

534
01:05:14,992 --> 01:05:16,582
Yes...

535
01:05:16,860 --> 01:05:19,850
but not before looking into
the Prefect's eyes...

536
01:05:20,229 --> 01:05:23,392
as he watches the world
come to an end.

537
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:28,364
For that, I will gladly
sacrifice my soul.

538
01:05:29,237 --> 01:05:31,933
<i>What about Raeborne?
Is he one of your converts?</i>

539
01:05:32,173 --> 01:05:34,232
<i>Anders? No?</i>

540
01:05:34,476 --> 01:05:37,410
<i>He's just a petty man, seeking
revenge against his father... -</i>

541
01:05:37,678 --> 01:05:41,136
<i>and the Raeborne Team-
He played right into my hands-</i>

542
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:44,316
<i>I knew he would start
the Red Plague-</i>

543
01:05:47,053 --> 01:05:49,078
<i>How did you keep tabs on him?</i>

544
01:05:50,555 --> 01:05:52,683
I have a tracking device.

545
01:05:53,091 --> 01:05:55,752
<i>Anders is so desperate
for answers... -</i>

546
01:05:56,061 --> 01:05:58,689
<i>he'll believe
anything you preach-</i>

547
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:02,898
I thought you were
a man of faith.

548
01:06:05,936 --> 01:06:07,301
My father was a man of faith...

549
01:06:07,571 --> 01:06:09,936
and it earned him
an early grave.

550
01:06:10,907 --> 01:06:14,672
I have learned that there is
no purpose in life.

551
01:06:14,878 --> 01:06:16,572
No grand scheme.

552
01:06:16,812 --> 01:06:19,145
All is wasteland.

553
01:07:55,002 --> 01:07:56,400
Wake up.

554
01:08:08,381 --> 01:08:10,008
You remember anything?

555
01:08:10,382 --> 01:08:12,407
Only your ugly face.

556
01:08:23,995 --> 01:08:26,896
You are so resilient.
And so was Marcus.

557
01:08:27,131 --> 01:08:28,996
But we know
what happened to him.

558
01:08:48,584 --> 01:08:50,142
You have a cure.

559
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,119
I don't leave things to chance.

560
01:09:48,970 --> 01:09:51,906
Hold on. I'll figure something out.

561
01:09:54,077 --> 01:09:57,911
Optimistic. It's in my bloodstream.
You know that.

562
01:10:09,157 --> 01:10:11,386
- Where are you going?
- Get another dose of the cure.

563
01:10:11,659 --> 01:10:13,559
- You got to get Raeborne.
- I can do both.

564
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:15,455
- There isn't time.
- What are you talking about?

565
01:10:15,696 --> 01:10:17,390
Follow Raeborne.

566
01:10:18,032 --> 01:10:21,990
Get to the people that are infected.
Their time is running out.

567
01:10:26,039 --> 01:10:28,007
- Now, go.
- What about you?

568
01:10:30,443 --> 01:10:32,239
I knew the risks.

569
01:10:32,846 --> 01:10:35,780
Now go. Go!

570
01:10:57,902 --> 01:10:58,731
<i>Hello-</i>

571
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:02,129
Jenn, it's Will. There's something
I need to tell you.

572
01:11:02,338 --> 01:11:04,204
<i>Put one on each table-</i>

573
01:11:04,441 --> 01:11:06,431
<i>- It's about Conner.
- Will? Are you still there?</i>

574
01:11:06,675 --> 01:11:08,040
Yeah, I'm still here.

575
01:11:08,277 --> 01:11:10,939
<i>It's crazy now- We just
opened the new restaurant-</i>

576
01:11:11,147 --> 01:11:14,479
<i>- Jenn, I haven't much time.
- I can barely hear you-</i>

577
01:11:14,749 --> 01:11:16,046
I said...

578
01:11:17,752 --> 01:11:19,742
I haven't...

579
01:11:20,121 --> 01:11:21,883
much time.

580
01:11:22,222 --> 01:11:24,418
<i>Will, you're breaking up... -</i>

581
01:11:29,263 --> 01:11:31,458
Where could he be?

582
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:35,263
Where is Conner?

583
01:11:39,172 --> 01:11:40,605
Yeah.

584
01:11:41,275 --> 01:11:42,707
It's my turn.

585
01:11:43,475 --> 01:11:46,502
Ok, ok. Don't cheat.

586
01:11:46,845 --> 01:11:49,006
- Don't leave the perimeter.
- Ok.

587
01:11:50,982 --> 01:11:53,884
One, two, three...

588
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:57,281
four, five, six...

589
01:11:57,555 --> 01:11:58,954
forty!

590
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,340
Conner!

591
01:14:04,771 --> 01:14:06,670
You're too late...

592
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,007
just like when you were
too late with your son.

593
01:14:45,305 --> 01:14:48,901
<i>The viral outbreak crisis
continues in King's Point-</i>

594
01:14:49,210 --> 01:14:52,202
<i>The governor has declared
a state of emergency... -</i>

595
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:55,847
<i>and called in the National Guard-
The centers for disease control... -</i>

596
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:59,347
<i>have reported cases of infection
across the east coast-</i>

597
01:14:59,785 --> 01:15:02,652
<i>The origin of the mysterious
plague, which scientist say... -</i>

598
01:15:02,923 --> 01:15:07,120
<i>is far deadlier than Ebola virus,
is still unknown-</i>

599
01:15:07,393 --> 01:15:10,919
<i>Some are calling it:
A disaster of biblical proportions-</i>

600
01:15:11,197 --> 01:15:14,962
<i>One thing is certain: Unless
a vaccine is quickly developed... -</i>

601
01:15:15,200 --> 01:15:17,963
<i>the entire nation will be
threatened by this epidemic-</i>

602
01:15:18,236 --> 01:15:21,137
<i>Jackson Therber, standing by
King's Point General... -</i>

603
01:15:21,406 --> 01:15:24,033
<i>- with this reports-
- It's chaos here-</i>

604
01:15:24,308 --> 01:15:25,936
<i>People are demanding answers-</i>

605
01:15:26,177 --> 01:15:29,634
Dr. Raeborne, the sooner we get
you out of the city, the better.

606
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:30,971
Now?

607
01:15:31,247 --> 01:15:32,977
The only way to protect you
from this thing...

608
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:34,811
<i>is to get you on the base.
I don't think you understand... -</i>

609
01:15:40,156 --> 01:15:43,283
the urgency.
Let's go!

610
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:31,192
<i>Go, go, go-</i>

611
01:16:45,449 --> 01:16:47,246
Doctor, wait here.

612
01:16:47,484 --> 01:16:51,543
Under no circumstances are you
to leave this truck. Be right back.

613
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:45,059
Anders, son...

614
01:17:46,971 --> 01:17:48,871
all this people...

615
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,334
Why do this?

616
01:17:53,577 --> 01:17:55,738
I can still help you.

617
01:17:58,014 --> 01:17:59,742
<i>Hey up here!</i>

618
01:18:38,284 --> 01:18:39,547
Hurry!

619
01:24:26,031 --> 01:24:27,622
I...

620
01:24:36,741 --> 01:24:39,903
Both cure and vaccine
have been given to the authorities.

621
01:24:40,245 --> 01:24:42,475
<i>The Red Plague
has been eradicated-</i>

622
01:24:42,714 --> 01:24:44,341
You were the one
who believed in her.

623
01:24:44,648 --> 01:24:47,345
<i>But you were the one
who didn't lose your faith-</i>

624
01:24:47,651 --> 01:24:50,245
<i>And for that, I thank you-</i>

625
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,946
Continue on the path.

626
01:25:11,238 --> 01:25:13,070
I've had to make new memories.

627
01:25:13,742 --> 01:25:15,334
You should do the same.

628
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:17,171
I don't know where to start.

629
01:25:17,478 --> 01:25:20,107
Start here.
You're needed.

630
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:22,941
There are threats
only you can handle.

631
01:25:25,486 --> 01:25:27,544
<i>I need to do something first-</i>

632
01:26:59,071 --> 01:27:03,028
<i>Since the dawn of creation,
I've been searching for a purpose-</i>

633
01:27:03,541 --> 01:27:06,008
<i>Now, I have one-</i>

634
01:27:08,279 --> 01:27:11,806
<i>I'm here to protect-
The Faith is my calling-</i>

635
01:27:12,750 --> 01:27:13,806
<i>My name is Lilith-</i>
