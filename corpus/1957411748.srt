6
00:00:52,767 --> 00:00:54,337

12
00:02:48,716 --> 00:02:50,553
Sorry about the wait.

13
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:14,943
Chief Anna Kimble,

14
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:17,412
sitting in with
Agent Michael Thomas.

15
00:03:19,347 --> 00:03:21,184
Can you state your name
for the record?

16
00:03:22,184 --> 00:03:23,986
So, what do you want
to talk about?

17
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:25,387
You.

18
00:03:25,421 --> 00:03:26,856
How are you doing?

19
00:03:26,888 --> 00:03:28,657
(scoffs)

20
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,859
Fine.

21
00:03:29,892 --> 00:03:31,661
Thanks for asking.

22
00:03:31,693 --> 00:03:34,630
How's the club
business holding up?

23
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:36,099
Good enough.

24
00:03:37,399 --> 00:03:39,368
You like managing
the club?

25
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,903
Yeah.
It's decent work.

26
00:03:40,935 --> 00:03:43,505
The hours are long,
but the pay's good,

27
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:44,907
so what are you
going to do?

28
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,210
Well, it's not the
most reputable clientele.

29
00:03:48,244 --> 00:03:50,312
As long as they pay
for their drinks

30
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,581
and don't touch
the girls,

31
00:03:51,613 --> 00:03:53,248
I don't care
who they are.

32
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,220
So...

33
00:04:00,923 --> 00:04:03,259
Tell me about
Melvin Anderson.

34
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:06,895
I don't know
a Melvin Anderson.

35
00:04:06,929 --> 00:04:08,664
Sure you do.

36
00:04:08,697 --> 00:04:10,700
You just like
to call him Baby Bear.

37
00:04:11,934 --> 00:04:14,169
His name is Melvin?

38
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,637
(laughs)

39
00:04:17,106 --> 00:04:19,108
It's strange.

40
00:04:21,776 --> 00:04:24,680
You're just the
manager of the club?

41
00:04:24,712 --> 00:04:26,715
What's so strange
about that?

42
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:28,350
Well...

43
00:04:28,384 --> 00:04:30,686
Mr. Anderson owns

44
00:04:30,719 --> 00:04:34,123
a number of
establishments

45
00:04:34,156 --> 00:04:37,192
and yet, you are
the only employee

46
00:04:37,226 --> 00:04:40,296
that he seems
to spend any time with.

47
00:04:40,329 --> 00:04:42,198
We're friends.

48
00:04:42,231 --> 00:04:43,865
Nothing wrong with that.

49
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:45,735
Sure.

50
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,645
It's the importing of drugs
that we have a problem with.

51
00:04:57,979 --> 00:04:59,615
Drugs?

52
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:04,387
Obviously, you want
to protect Mr. Anderson.

53
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,855
We understand that.

54
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:10,592
But the way we see it,
you're involved.

55
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,462
And you can
either help us...

56
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,998
...or you can
go down with him.

57
00:05:17,865 --> 00:05:19,901
Since I don't know
anything,

58
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:21,603
there's nothing
to help you with.

59
00:05:22,771 --> 00:05:24,774
Is that all?
Because I gotta go.

60
00:05:24,807 --> 00:05:27,377
Fine. Let's start
with this, then.

61
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:38,788
(♪♪♪)

62
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:45,461
(♪♪♪)

63
00:05:53,202 --> 00:05:54,870
Katherine Hayes.

64
00:06:00,909 --> 00:06:02,478
Steven Shavid.

65
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:15,623
So, again, state
your name for the record.

66
00:06:15,656 --> 00:06:17,293
- Jesus.
- For the record.

67
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:20,662
Brian Gibson.
Just like yesterday.

68
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:23,632
Then let's go
through it again.

69
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:25,834
Just like yesterday.

70
00:06:29,036 --> 00:06:32,640
Brian, we already
know everything.

71
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:35,043
You're not doing
yourself any favours.

72
00:06:42,784 --> 00:06:45,053
Why are you even trying
to cover this up?

73
00:06:46,454 --> 00:06:48,123
Don't you have any
self-preservation?

74
00:06:52,795 --> 00:06:54,464
Self-preservation?

75
00:06:56,397 --> 00:06:57,866
Fuck you.

76
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:01,870
My whole life has been
about self-preservation.

77
00:07:03,872 --> 00:07:06,209
Again, Brian,
we already know everything.

78
00:07:08,476 --> 00:07:11,613
Or do Katie and Steven
mean nothing to you?

79
00:07:13,048 --> 00:07:15,918
Is Bear the only one
you care about?

80
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:17,320
You know everything?

81
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,390
You don't know shit.

82
00:07:23,058 --> 00:07:24,560
Katie...

83
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:30,299
<i>When I had nothing,
she was there for me.</i>

84
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:31,567
<i>She...</i>

85
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:34,737
And Steven...

86
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:40,343
<i>Steven was my
best fucking friend.</i>

87
00:07:42,911 --> 00:07:46,081
Growing up,
we shared everything.

88
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:47,916
I had shit all.

89
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,051
I didn't even have
gloves for the winter.

90
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:51,253
But Steven...

91
00:07:53,255 --> 00:07:55,057
He'd give me his pair.

92
00:07:55,089 --> 00:07:57,493
And then, he'd tell
his parents he lost his

93
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:58,995
and they'd buy him
a new pair.

94
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:02,498
He did that
with everything.

95
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,733
It was nothing to him.

96
00:08:05,767 --> 00:08:07,103
To them.

97
00:08:10,538 --> 00:08:12,274
I didn't have shit,
you know?

98
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:14,710
My dad didn't even stick
around long enough for...

99
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:19,948
My mom.

100
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:23,719
My mom worked three jobs.

101
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,356
And even they didn't pay

102
00:08:27,389 --> 00:08:29,225
for more than
a one-bedroom apartment.

103
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:36,965
I met Katie at some bullshit
after-school care program

104
00:08:36,998 --> 00:08:38,300
in grade school.

105
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:39,569
And...

106
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:43,539
She was
the best thing there.

107
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:47,675
Then my mom got sick.

108
00:08:47,709 --> 00:08:49,512
<i>Cancer.</i>

109
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,979
(scoffs)

110
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:53,014
<i>But you fucking know that
already, don't you?</i>

111
00:08:53,047 --> 00:08:54,749
You know everything.

112
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,523
Katie got sent off
to juvie.

113
00:09:00,555 --> 00:09:02,557
And some shit
with her stepfather.

114
00:09:03,658 --> 00:09:05,493
Mom couldn't work anymore.

115
00:09:05,526 --> 00:09:07,062
She was dying.

116
00:09:09,064 --> 00:09:11,033
She didn't tell me anything.
I didn't...

117
00:09:14,002 --> 00:09:16,972
And Steven's parents sent him
off somewhere for school,

118
00:09:17,004 --> 00:09:19,274
so I did
what I had to do.

119
00:09:21,175 --> 00:09:23,244
I found
my own fucking family.

120
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:25,848
Mr. Anderson, Bear...

121
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,584
<i>He took me in when
no one else was around.</i>

122
00:09:29,618 --> 00:09:31,520
<i>He gave me
a fucking job.</i>

123
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:33,688
A purpose. And if it was
illegal shit, so what?

124
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:36,190
I survived.

125
00:09:36,224 --> 00:09:37,959
I did what I had to do.

126
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:46,035
I did what
I had to do, man.

127
00:09:47,102 --> 00:09:48,538
To survive.

128
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:52,041
To protect myself.

129
00:09:56,445 --> 00:09:57,914
OK, Brian.

130
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:01,182
Then tell us.

131
00:10:01,215 --> 00:10:02,984
What did you have to do...

132
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:06,421
...to survive?

133
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,892
(♪♪♪)

134
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:17,967
It was supposed to be
one last run.

135
00:10:20,969 --> 00:10:23,872
<i>Last fucking trip,
and then I was going to move up</i>

136
00:10:23,905 --> 00:10:25,575
<i>and move out,
and get my life back.</i>

137
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:31,145
<i>I wanted it to be big,
you know?</i>

138
00:10:31,179 --> 00:10:33,716
<i>And ending
and a beginning.</i>

139
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:35,216
<i>Katie and Steven...</i>

140
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:37,619
<i>I invited them along.</i>

141
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:40,288
<i>My girlfriend and
my best friend.</i>

142
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:42,490
So that they could
see me succeed.

143
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:46,462
So that they could
see me be someone.

144
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,567
<i>It was nice, you know.</i>

145
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:54,135
<i>To be there with them,
hanging out.</i>

146
00:10:57,272 --> 00:11:00,008
I had done drops before.
They're so fucking easy!

00:14:00,655 --> 00:14:02,324
(Katie and Steven):
What the fuck?

186
00:14:03,892 --> 00:14:05,993
What are you doing
with a gun?

187
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:07,061
For protection.

188
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,865
For protection?

189
00:14:09,897 --> 00:14:11,266
Are you an idiot?

190
00:14:11,299 --> 00:14:13,135
Get rid of it before
someone gets killed!

191
00:14:16,838 --> 00:14:18,106
Brian, what...

192
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:19,774
Say it again!

193
00:14:19,807 --> 00:14:22,477
Come on, motherfucker!
Say it again.

194
00:14:26,848 --> 00:14:28,851
That's what I thought.

195
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:35,289
(laughs)

196
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:37,025
Oh my God!

197
00:14:37,057 --> 00:14:38,292
You should've seen
your fucking face!

198
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:39,661
Man, it was priceless.

199
00:14:39,694 --> 00:14:41,964
You're suck a fucking idiot!

200
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,233
Someone could get killed with
you goofing around like that!

201
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,735
Relax. I'm just
messing with you.

202
00:14:46,767 --> 00:14:48,103
Wow.

203
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:55,678
(♪♪♪)

204
00:15:04,051 --> 00:15:06,721
(♪♪♪)

205
00:15:26,307 --> 00:15:29,043
(music playing on speaker)

206
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,949
As good as ever.

207
00:15:33,982 --> 00:15:36,351
I do not know what Joe
puts in that meatloaf,

208
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,519
but it is addictive.

209
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:40,522
Yeah, your dad
used to say that too.

210
00:15:40,555 --> 00:15:42,056
I know.

211
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:44,692
You know, he used to bring me
here every Friday night,

212
00:15:44,725 --> 00:15:47,028
after I visited him
at the department.

213
00:15:47,061 --> 00:15:48,964
Yeah, I remember.

214
00:15:48,997 --> 00:15:50,464
I miss him.

215
00:15:50,498 --> 00:15:52,066
Indeed.

216
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,200
Good evening.

217
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:54,536
Hi!

218
00:15:54,569 --> 00:15:56,305
You can just sit
wherever you'd like.

219
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,406
I'll be right
with you.

220
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:13,321
So, what can I get
for you to start?

221
00:16:14,355 --> 00:16:15,556
Three coffees, please.

222
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:16,557
You got it.

223
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,625
Thank you.

224
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:26,368
What are you guys thinking?
Maybe breakfast?

225
00:16:27,602 --> 00:16:29,171
Yeah?

226
00:16:29,204 --> 00:16:31,138
So, what
can I get for you?

227
00:16:31,171 --> 00:16:33,908
Can we maybe have
a few more minutes?

228
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:35,911
Of course, darling.
Let me know when you're ready.

229
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,012
Thank you.

230
00:16:37,045 --> 00:16:38,814
I think I want...

231
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:40,349
(man): Excuse me.

232
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:43,317
Yeah!

233
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:44,785
Can we have the bill,
please?

234
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:45,988
Sure.
Anything else for you?

235
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,189
No, thank you.

236
00:16:52,794 --> 00:16:54,463
(waitress): If you
don't need change,

237
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:55,930
you can just leave it
right there.

238
00:16:55,964 --> 00:16:57,498
(man): Great. Thank you.

239
00:17:25,492 --> 00:17:27,495
Thank you.
Have a good night.

240
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,665
Thank you, everybody.

241
00:17:31,598 --> 00:17:32,600
Sure thing.

242
00:17:35,003 --> 00:17:36,638
Oh!

243
00:17:36,671 --> 00:17:38,974
Fifty on a
twenty-seven-dollar bill.

244
00:17:39,007 --> 00:17:41,176
Generous!

245
00:17:41,209 --> 00:17:43,178
Speaking of bills,
what do I owe you?

246
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:44,880
I should get back out.

247
00:17:44,912 --> 00:17:46,480
I'll just put it
on your tab.

248
00:17:46,514 --> 00:17:48,483
Thank you, Janice.
I will see you tomorrow.

249
00:17:48,516 --> 00:17:50,419
You will.
You know, Anna...

250
00:17:50,451 --> 00:17:52,386
You really ought
to learn how to cook.

251
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,422
You would
miss me too much.

252
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,991
I would,
but at this rate,

253
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:58,427
poor Joe is going to have
to make a whole new menu.

254
00:17:58,459 --> 00:18:00,828
Just tell him to keep
that meatloaf on there.

255
00:18:00,862 --> 00:18:02,064
Good night.

256
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:03,364
Good night!

257
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:18,747
(Steven sighs)

258
00:18:25,085 --> 00:18:26,889
(♪♪♪)

259
00:18:31,226 --> 00:18:32,895
(laughing)

260
00:18:51,578 --> 00:18:53,647
Not yet!

261
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,084
I need a bath!

262
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:58,085
(grunts)

263
00:18:58,119 --> 00:18:59,488
(laughing)

264
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:11,333
(voices on television)

265
00:19:14,536 --> 00:19:16,671
Do you want to go
to the store?

266
00:19:16,703 --> 00:19:19,173
I forgot the phone card.
Do you want to come?

267
00:19:19,207 --> 00:19:20,941
Is there anything
open around here?

268
00:19:20,975 --> 00:19:23,145
I think I saw something
open on the corner.

269
00:19:28,115 --> 00:19:30,618
Why are you carrying
that thing around?

270
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,421
For protection.

271
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:35,589
From what?

272
00:19:35,623 --> 00:19:37,424
In my line of work,
anything can happen.

273
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,361
I need to be prepared.

274
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:42,631
Brian, all you do
is deliver stuff.

275
00:19:42,663 --> 00:19:45,700
You think I'm going
to do that the rest of my life?

276
00:19:45,732 --> 00:19:46,834
I sure hope not.

277
00:19:49,871 --> 00:19:51,473
Just give me a minute.

278
00:20:08,355 --> 00:20:09,723
Yes?

279
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:12,026
We're going to the store.
Do you want anything?

280
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,195
Um... Coke and Doritos.

281
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:16,331
All right.
Later.

282
00:20:17,998 --> 00:20:19,367
Hey, Brian.

283
00:20:20,401 --> 00:20:22,170
Did you call?

284
00:20:22,202 --> 00:20:24,738
No, not yet.

285
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,541
That's the first thing
you're supposed to do.

286
00:20:27,575 --> 00:20:29,177
Yeah.

287
00:20:29,209 --> 00:20:31,412
Whatever. I'll just call
when I get back.

288
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,694
Hi! How are you?

289
00:20:46,728 --> 00:20:47,930
Hi.

290
00:20:51,199 --> 00:20:52,534
OK.

291
00:21:00,374 --> 00:21:02,344
Wanted a Coke.

292
00:21:02,376 --> 00:21:03,711
Diet Coke?

293
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:17,725
(sighs)

294
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,232
Yeah!

295
00:21:24,265 --> 00:21:25,934
(laughs)

296
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,736
You want anything else?

297
00:21:27,768 --> 00:21:29,371
I'm good.

298
00:21:29,403 --> 00:21:30,671
All right.

299
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,583
Man, you don't look
so good.

300
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:42,617
Will...

301
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,586
...that be all?

302
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,756
Yeah.
That will be all.

303
00:21:56,497 --> 00:21:58,466
Breathe, buddy.

304
00:21:58,498 --> 00:22:00,602
Breathe.
We got plenty of money.

305
00:22:00,634 --> 00:22:02,603
We're not going to rob you.

306
00:22:04,338 --> 00:22:06,374
(♪♪♪)

307
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:23,825
Have a...

308
00:22:23,857 --> 00:22:25,293
...a nice...

309
00:22:27,327 --> 00:22:28,729
Good night.

310
00:22:41,174 --> 00:22:43,177
Wow, that guy was weird!

311
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,945
Some people are!

312
00:22:44,978 --> 00:22:46,715
Oh, shit.
I forgot the card.

313
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:48,482
Hold this.
I'll be right back.

314
00:22:49,484 --> 00:22:51,486
(♪♪♪)

315
00:22:52,586 --> 00:22:53,787
(grunting)

316
00:22:53,821 --> 00:22:54,856
Fucking sucks!

317
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:55,990
Let me see it!

318
00:22:56,023 --> 00:22:58,159
We've got to get
the fuck out of here.

319
00:22:58,191 --> 00:22:59,460
Can we stop
the bleeding first?

320
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,296
We have to get out of here.

321
00:23:01,328 --> 00:23:02,496
We gotta stop the bleeding.

322
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:11,206
Steven! Steven!

323
00:23:11,238 --> 00:23:13,575
Open the fucking door!

324
00:23:13,607 --> 00:23:14,675
What... the fuck?

325
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,010
We're leaving.

326
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:19,514
(police radio chatter)

327
00:23:30,857 --> 00:23:32,226
Quinn?

328
00:23:33,227 --> 00:23:34,429
What do we got?

329
00:23:34,461 --> 00:23:36,430
We got two dead.

330
00:23:36,463 --> 00:23:39,400
There's money
on the ground

331
00:23:39,433 --> 00:23:41,869
and there's a gun
by one of the bodies.

332
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:47,709
Ah, Christ.

333
00:23:47,741 --> 00:23:49,877
That's Billie Hadden,
Henry's girl.

334
00:23:59,719 --> 00:24:01,588
This doesn't seem right.

335
00:24:01,622 --> 00:24:03,257
I'm thinking
it's a robbery.

336
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:06,460
She's right by the gun...
And the money...

337
00:24:06,494 --> 00:24:10,098
I mean, she just
got out of rehab.

338
00:24:10,131 --> 00:24:13,401
Probably needed
the cash for drugs.

339
00:24:13,433 --> 00:24:14,868
It's a possibility.

340
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:18,940
But take a look
at the evidence.

341
00:24:20,141 --> 00:24:22,110
What do you mean?

342
00:24:22,142 --> 00:24:26,314
Well, why did Billie
shoot Sam or herself?

343
00:24:26,346 --> 00:24:28,415
She clearly got
what she wanted.

344
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:31,419
And two dead bodies
over there...

345
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:33,887
How did there get to be
blood on the door?

346
00:24:33,921 --> 00:24:35,356
These blood drops here?

347
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,491
Someone else was here?

348
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:40,428
The question is,

349
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:43,931
did they come in with Billie
or did they surprise her?

350
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:48,870
(♪♪♪)

351
00:24:53,607 --> 00:24:56,444
(♪♪♪)

352
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,117

353
00:25:09,123 --> 00:25:10,624

354
00:25:19,566 --> 00:25:21,368
(♪♪♪)

355
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,542
That makes sense.

356
00:25:28,575 --> 00:25:30,545
But why did the other
person have a gun?

357
00:25:31,711 --> 00:25:33,547
I mean, unless
Sam was so unlucky

358
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:35,150
he was about
to get robbed twice.

359
00:25:38,018 --> 00:25:39,554
Do me a favour.

360
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:41,890
Make sure we get samples
of all of the blood.

361
00:25:45,226 --> 00:25:46,594
All right.

362
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,569
(labored breathing)

363
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:57,839
Let me see.

364
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,911
Sorry, baby.
Let me take your shirt off.

365
00:26:04,444 --> 00:26:06,347
(groans)

366
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,589
Jesus, Brian!

367
00:26:15,623 --> 00:26:17,792
That doesn't look good!

368
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:20,828
What are we going to do?

369
00:26:20,861 --> 00:26:23,698
Because if anyone saw you,
we gotta go to the police now!

370
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,898
Did anyone see you?

371
00:26:24,931 --> 00:26:26,366
How the fuck am I
supposed to know?

372
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,502
You're the gangster
wannabe with your fucking gun!

373
00:26:27,535 --> 00:26:28,570
It wasn't my fault!

374
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,337
You said there
were two people dead

375
00:26:30,371 --> 00:26:31,738
and you shot
one of them.

376
00:26:31,771 --> 00:26:33,641
You shot one of them!

377
00:26:34,642 --> 00:26:36,443
You're in deep shit
and if you do nothing,

378
00:26:36,477 --> 00:26:37,545
you're going to
drag me down with you.

379
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:39,113
You're giving me
a fucking headache.

380
00:26:39,145 --> 00:26:40,847
You'll have
a lot more than that!

381
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:42,182
Either shut up
or get out.

382
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:43,885
Don't tell me what to do!

383
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,092
(groans)

384
00:26:54,961 --> 00:26:57,265
Guys, we gotta go
to the police.

385
00:26:57,297 --> 00:26:59,132
What if somebody saw you?

386
00:26:59,165 --> 00:27:01,101
We gotta go to the police
before they do

387
00:27:01,134 --> 00:27:02,036
and explain
the situation.

388
00:27:02,068 --> 00:27:03,537
No police, Steven.

389
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,039
Shit!
I can't handle this!

390
00:27:05,072 --> 00:27:07,108
It looks like it went
all the way through.

391
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:08,575
It's pretty much
stopped bleeding.

392
00:27:08,609 --> 00:27:10,411
If I get it cleaned
and wrapped, you should be fine.

393
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:12,379
First aid kit's
in the car, babe.

394
00:27:12,412 --> 00:27:15,083
(heavy breathing)

395
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:16,817
Jesus, Brian.

396
00:27:17,485 --> 00:27:19,821
I don't even know you anymore.

397
00:27:21,122 --> 00:27:22,556
People change, Steven.

398
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,325
I'm trying to deal
with a situation

399
00:27:24,357 --> 00:27:25,759
and you're
really not helping.

400
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:27,228
Brian!

401
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,997
You killed somebody.

402
00:27:29,029 --> 00:27:30,565
If you didn't
bring that gun,

403
00:27:30,597 --> 00:27:32,232
none of this
would have happened!

404
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:34,502
If I didn't have the gun,
I'd be dead.

405
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:36,738
Have you thought about
what Bear's going to do

406
00:27:36,770 --> 00:27:38,606
when he finds
out about this?

407
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,342
He's not going to.

408
00:27:41,374 --> 00:27:42,977
You can't be
that stupid, man.

409
00:27:43,009 --> 00:27:45,445
Bear is going to find out
about this and have us killed.

410
00:27:45,478 --> 00:27:47,515
He's not going
to think twice about it.

411
00:27:47,547 --> 00:27:50,450
Fuck off, Steven.
Fuck off.

412
00:27:50,484 --> 00:27:52,353
Let's just get
through tonight, OK?

413
00:27:52,385 --> 00:27:53,820
We can figure it
all out tomorrow.

414
00:27:53,853 --> 00:27:55,190
Shit.

415
00:27:56,289 --> 00:27:57,625
He's really freaked out.

416
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:07,401
OK.

417
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,509
(groans)

418
00:28:17,812 --> 00:28:19,046
Can you...

419
00:28:20,314 --> 00:28:22,115
You gotta call Bear now.

420
00:28:22,149 --> 00:28:24,084
Shit. I forgot.

421
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:32,526
Sorry, man.

422
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:36,864
In and out, as planned.

423
00:28:40,834 --> 00:28:42,069
Good night.

424
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,706
(sighs)

425
00:28:49,075 --> 00:28:50,879
(♪♪♪)

426
00:28:55,248 --> 00:28:57,685
So, Steven
was freaking out.

427
00:28:58,853 --> 00:29:01,656
He didn't have much
of a stomach, did he?

428
00:29:01,689 --> 00:29:03,024
Go on.

429
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:11,365
Then what?

430
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,980
Brian.

431
00:29:29,784 --> 00:29:31,052
Come here.

432
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,999
(sigh)

433
00:29:51,838 --> 00:29:53,575
I love you.

434
00:29:54,842 --> 00:29:56,076
I love you too.

435
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,248
I'm sorry about tonight.

436
00:30:01,448 --> 00:30:03,450
I don't know if anybody
heard or saw.

437
00:30:03,484 --> 00:30:05,153
There wasn't
anybody there, baby.

438
00:30:06,953 --> 00:30:08,755
Are you going to be OK?

439
00:30:08,788 --> 00:30:10,257
Yeah. Fine.

440
00:30:11,491 --> 00:30:13,560
I'll be fine.

441
00:30:13,594 --> 00:30:14,796
Are you all right?

442
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:17,832
Yeah.

443
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,804
I'll call Bear tomorrow.
He'll know what to do.

444
00:30:24,037 --> 00:30:25,940
He'll know if
anyone's looking for us.

445
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:31,077
I don't want to know, OK?

446
00:30:31,111 --> 00:30:33,781
I just meant that
he'll know what to do.

447
00:30:33,814 --> 00:30:35,450
I have to tell him.

448
00:30:41,488 --> 00:30:43,190
There's another thing.

449
00:30:44,892 --> 00:30:46,460
(groans)

450
00:30:54,634 --> 00:30:58,038
He can't know
you were here.

451
00:30:59,206 --> 00:31:00,875
What?

452
00:31:00,908 --> 00:31:04,913
He can't know
you're here.

453
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,983
Great.

454
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:10,985
Thank you.

455
00:32:15,415 --> 00:32:17,117
(quietly): Bear?

456
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:23,892
I have a problem, man.

457
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:29,397
This is serious.

458
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:35,436
I had a mix-up.

459
00:32:38,072 --> 00:32:40,775
I think I shot someone
at a store.

460
00:32:43,142 --> 00:32:46,014
You gotta believe me, man.
It was an accident.

461
00:32:51,017 --> 00:32:52,921
I don't think so.

462
00:32:56,323 --> 00:32:58,026
No one saw.

463
00:32:59,426 --> 00:33:01,996
No, but...

464
00:33:02,028 --> 00:33:04,132
I told him.
He's freaking out.

465
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:16,844
He says he wants to maybe
go to the police.

466
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,382
In another room.

467
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:35,028
(♪♪♪)

468
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,532
(choked up): Bear.

469
00:33:40,299 --> 00:33:42,336
(♪♪♪)

470
00:33:45,139 --> 00:33:46,741
(crying)

471
00:33:49,876 --> 00:33:51,411
Bear.

472
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:04,758
(♪♪♪)

473
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,670
(♪♪♪)

474
00:34:28,214 --> 00:34:31,051
Good morning, Chief.
I got your coffee for you.

475
00:34:31,085 --> 00:34:32,853
Thank you, Janice.

476
00:34:39,026 --> 00:34:42,228
Oh. You look
the worse for wear.

477
00:34:42,261 --> 00:34:44,664
I heard about what happened
at the liquor store last night.

478
00:34:44,698 --> 00:34:46,067
Poor Sam.

479
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:47,601
Such a good man.

480
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,203
Hmm.

481
00:34:49,236 --> 00:34:51,839
You know, he is one
of the people who talked me

482
00:34:51,872 --> 00:34:53,440
into running for chief
after my father passed.

483
00:34:53,473 --> 00:34:55,176
You don't say!

484
00:34:55,209 --> 00:34:57,078
I mean, the whole town
wanted you to.

485
00:34:58,245 --> 00:35:00,147
Your dad's been grooming you
since you were knee-high.

486
00:35:01,482 --> 00:35:04,752
There's never been anything
else I wanted to do.

487
00:35:04,785 --> 00:35:08,122
Except maybe last night, when I
was sitting at the liquor store.

488
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:10,490
Or this morning,
talking to Billie's aunt.

489
00:35:11,390 --> 00:35:13,060
Bless her heart.

490
00:35:14,227 --> 00:35:16,062
You know, you're going
to figure out what happened.

491
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,466
That'll ease the pain some.

492
00:35:18,498 --> 00:35:20,767
That is the hope.

493
00:35:24,171 --> 00:35:26,739
You know...

494
00:35:26,772 --> 00:35:29,509
Those three kids
that came in last night...

495
00:35:33,312 --> 00:35:36,249
<i>They were driving a blue SUV.</i>

496
00:35:36,283 --> 00:35:38,486
And? OK.

497
00:35:38,518 --> 00:35:40,254
I wouldn't have
thought much of it,

498
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:43,123
except those other two,
the big spender.

499
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:48,129
They were driving the exact
same make and model.

500
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:51,198
You don't say.

501
00:35:52,598 --> 00:35:56,169
Two of the exact same blue
SUVs sitting in a parking lot.

502
00:35:56,203 --> 00:35:57,505
That makes you look.

503
00:36:00,207 --> 00:36:01,674
Right.

504
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:04,511
Thank you, Janice,
for the coffee.

505
00:36:04,544 --> 00:36:06,513
Sure thing, Chief.

506
00:36:06,547 --> 00:36:08,149
Be safe.

507
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:09,517
And this one,
it's on me.

508
00:36:09,549 --> 00:36:10,852
Thank you.

509
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:20,560
(birds chirping)

510
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:25,431
I need you to do this.

511
00:36:25,464 --> 00:36:26,966
I can't!

512
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,304
Please.
I'm begging you.

513
00:36:30,337 --> 00:36:31,438
Baby, I can't.

514
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:32,840
Then, it's us.

515
00:36:32,872 --> 00:36:34,341
Maybe it has to be!

516
00:36:36,076 --> 00:36:39,847
Sometimes, we have to do
things that aren't right.

517
00:36:39,879 --> 00:36:41,381
You're talking
about murder!

518
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,183
We don't have a choice.

519
00:36:43,216 --> 00:36:44,651
You don't. I do!

520
00:36:46,819 --> 00:36:48,488
Better make the right one.

521
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:52,225
Think what
you're asking me to do.

522
00:36:52,259 --> 00:36:53,261
I'm...

523
00:36:54,861 --> 00:36:58,665
...asking you
to help me protect us.

524
00:36:59,665 --> 00:37:01,535
Us?

525
00:37:01,567 --> 00:37:02,836
Please.

526
00:37:03,770 --> 00:37:05,273
I want to be together.

527
00:37:06,239 --> 00:37:08,408
Forever. OK?

528
00:37:08,442 --> 00:37:11,846
This is the only way
that's going to happen.

529
00:37:15,582 --> 00:37:17,183
Then why
don't you do it?

530
00:37:17,216 --> 00:37:18,318
I have to drive.

531
00:37:18,352 --> 00:37:19,652
Why can't I drive?

532
00:37:19,685 --> 00:37:21,988
Look.

533
00:37:22,022 --> 00:37:25,326
I need him in the front seat.
I've already explained this.

534
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:26,694
(knock on the door)

535
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,330
Yeah.

536
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:30,765
(Steven): It's Steven.

537
00:37:41,375 --> 00:37:42,643
(scoffs)

538
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:50,785
So what are we
going to do?

539
00:37:51,884 --> 00:37:53,053
Don't start.

540
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:54,520
What the hell
do you mean?

541
00:37:54,553 --> 00:37:56,189
What are we
going to do?

542
00:37:56,223 --> 00:37:58,359
Nothing.

543
00:37:58,392 --> 00:38:00,928
We have a delivery to make,
and it's going to be made.

544
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:03,697
Brian,
you killed somebody.

545
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:06,033
I thought maybe you would've
talked some sense into him.

546
00:38:06,065 --> 00:38:07,234
Ready to go?

547
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:11,305
The police will be
looking for us.

548
00:38:11,337 --> 00:38:13,073
The police don't know
what they're looking for.

549
00:38:13,105 --> 00:38:15,408
The officer at the restaurant
saw us last night.

550
00:38:15,442 --> 00:38:17,311
We don't look like
we're from around here.

551
00:38:17,343 --> 00:38:19,046
She left before we did,

552
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:20,814
so she knows what our
fucking truck looks like!

553
00:38:20,846 --> 00:38:22,815
Then stay here.

554
00:38:22,848 --> 00:38:25,318
Please, let's just
go to the police!

555
00:38:25,352 --> 00:38:27,221
You said it was
an accident!

556
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:29,156
Can you make yourself useful
and talk to him?

557
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,665
So what's this?
The silent treatment?

558
00:38:38,698 --> 00:38:40,133
Steven, are you
coming or not?

559
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,636
Brian, I've known you all
my life. Fucking listen to me!

560
00:38:42,669 --> 00:38:44,337
I have a delivery
to make.

561
00:38:45,439 --> 00:38:47,040
Do you fucking
understand?

562
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,948
I'm going
to the police.

563
00:38:55,982 --> 00:38:57,718
Steven...

564
00:38:58,951 --> 00:39:00,453
You'd do that?

565
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:05,092
We have no choice.

566
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:08,396
If you want out of this,
then stay here.

567
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,732
End of story.

568
00:39:15,368 --> 00:39:17,270
Fuck you, man.

569
00:39:17,303 --> 00:39:18,471
Useless!

570
00:39:19,739 --> 00:39:21,174
(door opens and closes)

571
00:39:35,522 --> 00:39:37,591
(police radio chatter)

572
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:58,245
(siren wails)

573
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:07,020
(police radio chatter)

574
00:40:20,433 --> 00:40:23,370
(♪♪♪)

575
00:40:31,076 --> 00:40:32,678
Morning.

576
00:40:32,712 --> 00:40:34,415
Morning, officer.

577
00:40:34,448 --> 00:40:35,848
You two sleep all right?

578
00:40:35,881 --> 00:40:37,784
Very well, thank you.

579
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:40,353
How long have you two
been in town?

580
00:40:40,386 --> 00:40:43,089
The one night.
We're just passing through.

581
00:40:44,424 --> 00:40:45,526
Where are you heading?

582
00:40:45,558 --> 00:40:46,893
West.

583
00:40:47,993 --> 00:40:49,863
Where, exactly?
If you don't mind me asking.

584
00:40:49,895 --> 00:40:51,798
The coast.

585
00:40:51,832 --> 00:40:53,467
Is there a problem?

586
00:40:54,634 --> 00:40:56,303
I don't know.
Is there?

587
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:57,870
No, ma'am.
We're just...

588
00:40:57,904 --> 00:41:00,940
I need to see your licence
and registration.

589
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:02,575
You too.

590
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:13,453
(♪♪♪)

591
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:29,370
(♪♪♪)

592
00:41:37,277 --> 00:41:38,446
(sighs)

593
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:50,490
(♪♪♪)

594
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,103
Whose vehicle is this?

595
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:05,038
It's a company car.

596
00:42:05,071 --> 00:42:06,507
What company?

597
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,442
Nivet Corp.
We're from out east.

598
00:42:08,475 --> 00:42:10,677
So what are you doing
all the way out here?

599
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,446
We do audits.

600
00:42:12,478 --> 00:42:14,281
You always drive?

601
00:42:14,314 --> 00:42:16,116
Yeah.

602
00:42:16,149 --> 00:42:17,683
Why?

603
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:19,886
We cover
the entire country, so...

604
00:42:23,022 --> 00:42:24,290
Well, all right.

605
00:42:24,323 --> 00:42:25,224
Here are your things.

606
00:42:25,257 --> 00:42:26,460
Thank you, ma'am.

607
00:42:26,493 --> 00:42:27,628
Safe travels.

608
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,661
You too.

609
00:42:32,565 --> 00:42:35,035
Say, by the way...

610
00:42:35,067 --> 00:42:37,470
The restaurant,
last night...

611
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:39,973
Do you two remember
those two fellas

612
00:42:40,006 --> 00:42:41,542
who came in
with that girl?

613
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,746
Uh, no, we don't.

614
00:42:46,779 --> 00:42:48,348
Sorry. Why?

615
00:42:51,551 --> 00:42:54,555
Never mind.
Have a good day.

616
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:59,292
(♪♪♪)

617
00:43:00,727 --> 00:43:02,562
Better make a call.

618
00:43:02,596 --> 00:43:03,931
Already dialing.

619
00:43:07,366 --> 00:43:09,202
(♪♪♪)

620
00:43:19,879 --> 00:43:21,748
(music playing on the radio)

621
00:43:33,326 --> 00:43:34,828
(sniffs)

622
00:43:40,065 --> 00:43:43,136
See? Even your girlfriend
has a problem with this.

623
00:43:44,337 --> 00:43:45,572
You know what?

624
00:43:45,605 --> 00:43:47,407
You do
what you need to do

625
00:43:47,439 --> 00:43:49,241
and I'll do
what I need to do.

626
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:51,344
What?
Is that a fucking threat?

627
00:43:59,252 --> 00:44:01,488
(♪♪♪)

628
00:44:10,096 --> 00:44:11,665
(Steven): What the fuck
are you doing?

629
00:44:13,265 --> 00:44:14,701
(gunshot)

630
00:44:15,935 --> 00:44:18,639
(whimpering)

631
00:44:28,614 --> 00:44:31,285
Hey. It's OK, Katie.

632
00:44:32,718 --> 00:44:34,654
(crying)

633
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:40,694
(♪♪♪)

634
00:44:43,296 --> 00:44:45,064
(whimpering)

635
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:55,676
(♪♪♪)

636
00:45:08,687 --> 00:45:10,823
(labored breathing)

637
00:45:12,725 --> 00:45:14,594
I'll meet you 30 miles
up the road.

638
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:16,696
Get yourself
together, babe.

639
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,065
OK.

640
00:45:18,098 --> 00:45:19,700
Katie, come on!

641
00:45:19,732 --> 00:45:21,401
Please.

642
00:45:21,433 --> 00:45:22,702
I need you.

643
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:28,676
Remember: 30 miles east.

644
00:45:37,917 --> 00:45:40,420
Yes, that week
is all booked off.

645
00:45:40,453 --> 00:45:42,221
I booked it off
like a month ago.

646
00:45:42,254 --> 00:45:43,690
Yeah, that should
be fine.

647
00:45:44,957 --> 00:45:46,759
And the weather's going
to be super nice, so...

648
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:51,263
Ha! Um...
Yeah, I gotta go.

649
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:52,833
OK. Bye.

650
00:45:52,866 --> 00:45:54,201
May I help you?

651
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:56,103
Can I rent a car, please?

652
00:45:56,136 --> 00:45:59,339
Mine broke down a ways back.
I had to hitch a ride here.

653
00:45:59,372 --> 00:46:00,906
No problem.

654
00:46:00,939 --> 00:46:03,209
I just need a credit card
and a driver's licence.

655
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:04,678
Oh!

656
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:06,379
- Are you OK?
- Yeah! Yeah.

657
00:46:08,714 --> 00:46:10,249
I am fine!

658
00:46:29,335 --> 00:46:30,904
(door closes)

659
00:46:32,739 --> 00:46:33,874
Hi, babe.

660
00:46:33,906 --> 00:46:35,274
Hey.

661
00:46:36,241 --> 00:46:38,978
Don't touch me, please.

662
00:46:39,011 --> 00:46:40,546
I can't.

663
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,549
I just need this
to be over.

664
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:43,950
Fine.

665
00:46:43,982 --> 00:46:45,885
Any problems?

666
00:46:45,919 --> 00:46:47,754
No.

667
00:46:48,754 --> 00:46:49,789
See?

668
00:46:50,989 --> 00:46:52,491
Please, let's just...

669
00:46:52,524 --> 00:46:54,360
All right.

670
00:46:55,694 --> 00:46:57,430
Let's go.

671
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:03,536
Babe?

672
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,776
(clicks tongue)

673
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:44,677
(♪♪♪)

674
00:47:56,388 --> 00:47:58,424
(♪♪♪)

675
00:48:03,328 --> 00:48:06,566
You remember how you
always say you love me?

676
00:48:09,868 --> 00:48:11,904
Katie, I do love you.

677
00:48:13,772 --> 00:48:15,075
How...

678
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:18,779
Would you...

679
00:48:21,346 --> 00:48:23,616
Could you ever kill me?

680
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:26,853
Are you serious?

681
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:29,288
You know...

682
00:48:31,223 --> 00:48:32,859
You know I could
never do that.

683
00:48:34,527 --> 00:48:35,996
Steven was
your best friend,

684
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:37,864
but you made
that decision easily.

685
00:48:39,399 --> 00:48:41,167
It wasn't easy.

686
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:42,602
That wasn't...

687
00:48:44,102 --> 00:48:46,005
I just mean...

688
00:48:46,038 --> 00:48:48,542
You didn't even look
at the other options.

689
00:48:50,209 --> 00:48:52,379
There were
no other options.

690
00:48:53,779 --> 00:48:55,248
We didn't have a choice.

691
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,556
(♪♪♪)

692
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,596
(birds chirping)

693
00:49:19,004 --> 00:49:20,840
What a mess.

694
00:49:38,024 --> 00:49:39,292
Hi!

695
00:49:39,325 --> 00:49:41,261
Hi!

696
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:42,996
Chief Anna Kimble.

697
00:49:43,029 --> 00:49:45,098
Oh! Jeremy Miller.

698
00:49:46,031 --> 00:49:47,600
You got here quick.

699
00:49:47,632 --> 00:49:49,234
I did.

700
00:49:49,268 --> 00:49:51,103
I hate unsolved murders.

701
00:49:52,705 --> 00:49:55,507
Well, I got your email
about a blue SUV.

702
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,743
Then a little while ago,
I got a call

703
00:49:57,777 --> 00:50:00,080
about a blue SUV
at the bottom of a cliff.

704
00:50:00,113 --> 00:50:02,482
I figured it was a little
too close of a coincidence.

705
00:50:02,515 --> 00:50:03,951
Decided
to give you a ring.

706
00:50:04,951 --> 00:50:06,520
It's...

707
00:50:07,953 --> 00:50:09,622
It's not in great shape.

708
00:50:09,654 --> 00:50:10,957
We can't really
get down there.

709
00:50:10,989 --> 00:50:13,359
The cliff side here
is all unstable.

710
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:16,562
I don't know...

711
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:19,766
I don't see
any skid marks.

712
00:50:19,799 --> 00:50:21,868
The driver probably
just fell asleep and...

713
00:50:23,636 --> 00:50:24,738
I suppose.

714
00:50:25,738 --> 00:50:26,973
Mind if I take
a look around?

715
00:50:27,006 --> 00:50:29,274
No, be my guest.

716
00:50:29,308 --> 00:50:31,710
Unless anything changes, I'm
treating this like an accident.

717
00:50:31,743 --> 00:50:34,180
It's just your email
that gave us a little tip off.

718
00:50:34,212 --> 00:50:36,015
I appreciate the call.

719
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:42,555
Have you seen this?

720
00:50:44,991 --> 00:50:47,360
It's like a second set
of tire tracks.

721
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:49,996
And then we've got
these footprints

722
00:50:50,029 --> 00:50:52,032
that seem to go
between the two vehicles.

723
00:50:52,064 --> 00:50:55,067
No, I didn't.
I just got here myself.

724
00:50:56,169 --> 00:50:58,571
(♪♪♪)

725
00:51:00,239 --> 00:51:02,809
Two hikers called it in.

726
00:51:02,841 --> 00:51:04,710
They made sure to call you

727
00:51:04,743 --> 00:51:07,013
and then they sent me
up here to check it out.

728
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:11,050
These depressions...
Deeper here and here.

729
00:51:12,618 --> 00:51:15,589
<i>Looks like the SUV sat here
awhile before it went off.</i>

730
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:21,160
(sighs)

731
00:51:21,194 --> 00:51:24,064
I guess that means it's not
going to be a simple accident.

732
00:51:24,096 --> 00:51:25,497
I guess not.

733
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:27,033
You want to call it in?

734
00:51:27,065 --> 00:51:28,301
Sure.

735
00:51:30,102 --> 00:51:33,038
I guess the question is, where
did they get the other car?

736
00:51:33,071 --> 00:51:35,107
And where is it now?

737
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:39,613
(♪♪♪)

738
00:51:56,228 --> 00:51:59,065
(♪♪♪)

739
00:52:03,835 --> 00:52:06,238
You know the rental place
has all my information?

740
00:52:06,272 --> 00:52:07,607
Don't worry about it.

741
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,241
It's easy for you to say.

742
00:52:09,274 --> 00:52:10,609
Katie, come on.

743
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:13,378
You're right.

744
00:52:13,411 --> 00:52:14,747
(Brian sighs)

745
00:52:16,515 --> 00:52:19,518
I just wish I could wake up
and have this all be a dream.

746
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:24,891
You know, I...

747
00:52:24,924 --> 00:52:25,992
I know.

748
00:52:28,460 --> 00:52:30,497
Do you still love me?

749
00:52:32,031 --> 00:52:33,467
You know I do, babe.

750
00:52:34,933 --> 00:52:36,535
Make me a promise.

751
00:52:37,602 --> 00:52:38,671
Katie...

752
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,543
You knew who I was when you
decided to come with me.

753
00:52:44,477 --> 00:52:46,312
And that makes
killing someone OK?

754
00:52:46,344 --> 00:52:48,013
We didn't have a choice.

755
00:52:49,281 --> 00:52:51,183
Maybe we should...

756
00:52:51,216 --> 00:52:54,186
Maybe you should stop
trying to tell me what to do.

757
00:52:54,219 --> 00:52:56,689
I grew up without a mother.
I don't need one now.

758
00:53:00,292 --> 00:53:03,162
(♪♪♪)

759
00:53:14,172 --> 00:53:15,975
(♪♪♪)

760
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:24,116
Hi! How are you?

761
00:53:24,149 --> 00:53:25,684
Good, thanks.
How are you?

762
00:53:25,718 --> 00:53:29,055
I'm good.
I'm Chief of police Anna Kimble.

763
00:53:29,087 --> 00:53:30,656
From over in Hope.

764
00:53:30,689 --> 00:53:33,158
Is there anything
I can help you with, Chief?

765
00:53:33,192 --> 00:53:35,027
I am certainly hoping so.

766
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,895
You wouldn't happen
to have been working

767
00:53:36,928 --> 00:53:38,564
the last couple of nights?

768
00:53:38,598 --> 00:53:40,366
Yeah!
When don't I work?

769
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:41,868
I know that feeling.

770
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,469
(laughs)

771
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:45,171
Do you get a lot
of business around here?

772
00:53:45,203 --> 00:53:47,306
You know how it is.

773
00:53:47,339 --> 00:53:49,475
Small town.
Not a lot going on.

774
00:53:49,507 --> 00:53:52,978
A couple of regulars
rent cars and trucks

775
00:53:53,011 --> 00:53:56,315
to haul stuff, pick up
relatives, that sort of thing.

776
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:57,984
Every once in a while,

777
00:53:58,017 --> 00:54:00,053
we get a car that
breaks down here and there.

778
00:54:00,085 --> 00:54:02,154
Sounds like you know
this place pretty well.

779
00:54:02,187 --> 00:54:03,689
I've lived here
my whole life.

780
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:06,259
Then you are exactly the
right person for me to talk to.

781
00:54:06,292 --> 00:54:08,361
Is this official business?

782
00:54:09,527 --> 00:54:12,364
It is, but
I can't talk about it.

783
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:16,169
But I was wondering
if you noticed

784
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:19,839
anything different
the last couple of nights.

785
00:54:19,872 --> 00:54:23,509
Maybe somebody came in,
didn't seem quite right.

786
00:54:23,542 --> 00:54:25,879
Or someone
you didn't recognize.

787
00:54:27,046 --> 00:54:29,181
There was this girl,
a couple of nights ago.

788
00:54:29,214 --> 00:54:30,749
Came in late.

789
00:54:30,783 --> 00:54:33,185
She was real
nervous and jumpy.

790
00:54:33,218 --> 00:54:35,087
She dropped her stuff
all over the floor.

791
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,189
Was she alone?

792
00:54:37,223 --> 00:54:40,227
Her car broke down a ways
back, so she got a ride here.

793
00:54:41,393 --> 00:54:44,196
You wouldn't happen
to have seen who dropped her off

794
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:46,799
or what kind of vehicle
they were driving?

795
00:54:46,832 --> 00:54:49,169
No, I didn't see her
until she walked in.

796
00:54:50,236 --> 00:54:52,205
Is there any possibility

797
00:54:52,238 --> 00:54:54,239
that I can take a look
at her paperwork?

798
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:56,041
Sure thing!

799
00:54:56,075 --> 00:54:57,710
Let me just
pull it up here.

800
00:54:57,743 --> 00:54:59,411
Thank you.

801
00:54:59,444 --> 00:55:01,814
You know, part of the reason
she stood out

802
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:04,149
was because she wanted
to pay in cash,

803
00:55:04,183 --> 00:55:07,387
and the company charges a big
deposit for people under 23.

804
00:55:07,419 --> 00:55:10,389
And she didn't have
enough cash to...

805
00:55:10,422 --> 00:55:12,325
Here it is.

806
00:55:12,357 --> 00:55:15,060
I'm just going to go
print it for you.

807
00:55:15,093 --> 00:55:17,830
That would be wonderful.
Thank you.

808
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:43,088
This is perfect.
Thank you.

809
00:55:43,122 --> 00:55:44,089
Thank you.

810
00:55:44,122 --> 00:55:46,091
- Have a good day.
- You too.

811
00:55:46,125 --> 00:55:47,227
Ha!

812
00:55:51,629 --> 00:55:54,401
(♪♪♪)

813
00:56:05,143 --> 00:56:07,080
(phone rings)

814
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:15,788
Hello?

815
00:56:15,821 --> 00:56:17,723
(Bear): <i>How are you doing,
Brian?</i>

816
00:56:18,857 --> 00:56:21,193
Good.

817
00:56:21,227 --> 00:56:22,328
<i>How's everything?</i>

818
00:56:23,828 --> 00:56:25,797
Good.

819
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:27,267
<i>You don't sound
too good, man.</i>

820
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,236
Just tired.

821
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:31,837
<i>I understand.</i>

822
00:56:33,105 --> 00:56:35,342
<i>You know I'm here to take care
of you, right?</i>

823
00:56:36,341 --> 00:56:37,977
I know.

824
00:56:38,009 --> 00:56:40,312
<i>You did
what you had to do.</i>

825
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:43,315
<i>Family first.
That means you too.</i>

826
00:56:43,348 --> 00:56:45,250
Right.

827
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:50,957
That was Bear?

828
00:56:52,357 --> 00:56:53,859
Yeah.

829
00:56:55,127 --> 00:56:57,430
What did he want?

830
00:56:57,462 --> 00:56:59,531
He just wanted to see
how I was doing.

831
00:57:01,866 --> 00:57:03,669
That's all?

832
00:57:03,701 --> 00:57:05,372
That's all.

833
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:11,377
(music playing on the radio)

834
00:57:14,712 --> 00:57:16,281
You know, it's funny.

835
00:57:19,317 --> 00:57:21,388
I can never tell
when you're lying.

836
00:57:25,056 --> 00:57:26,725
I don't lie to you.

837
00:57:33,232 --> 00:57:36,268
(♪♪♪)

838
00:57:48,814 --> 00:57:51,783
What would you say

839
00:57:51,817 --> 00:57:55,255
if I just wanted to take
the money and run?

840
00:57:56,288 --> 00:57:58,324
I'd say you were crazy.

841
00:57:58,357 --> 00:58:00,960
Bear would hunt you down
and kill you.

842
00:58:00,993 --> 00:58:04,497
There's over
a million dollars in there.

843
00:58:04,529 --> 00:58:06,232
We could go
wherever we wanted.

844
00:58:06,265 --> 00:58:08,535
There's no way I'm living
my life on the run.

845
00:58:10,636 --> 00:58:12,505
You're already on the run.

846
00:58:12,538 --> 00:58:14,507
Ha! Very funny.

847
00:58:14,540 --> 00:58:16,109
It wasn't meant to be.

848
00:58:20,379 --> 00:58:22,449
What did Bear really say?

849
00:58:23,448 --> 00:58:24,983
I told you.

850
00:58:25,017 --> 00:58:27,352
He just wanted to see
how I was doing.

851
00:58:28,786 --> 00:58:30,457
And that's all?

852
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:36,562
So what's with the sudden
change of heart, then?

853
00:58:37,796 --> 00:58:39,431
What?

854
00:58:39,464 --> 00:58:41,933
You talk about Bear
like he's God.

855
00:58:41,966 --> 00:58:44,203
And now you say you're willing
to steal from him?

856
00:58:45,471 --> 00:58:46,772
I don't like it.

857
00:58:46,805 --> 00:58:49,375
You know what?
Forget it.

858
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:57,484
(♪♪♪)

859
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:08,995
(knock on door)

860
00:59:09,027 --> 00:59:11,029
Come in!

861
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:12,664
Good, you're still here.

862
00:59:12,698 --> 00:59:14,901
I'm just finishing up
some paperwork.

863
00:59:14,933 --> 00:59:16,801
What's up, Quinn?

864
00:59:16,835 --> 00:59:19,505
I ran that check on that name
for you, Katie Armstrong.

865
00:59:19,538 --> 00:59:21,507
Come in, come in.
Sit down.

866
00:59:23,942 --> 00:59:27,513
I also sent an email to the
local departments about her.

867
00:59:27,546 --> 00:59:29,714
Did you get anything?

868
00:59:29,747 --> 00:59:32,451
It turns out Ms. Armstrong
has quite the record.

869
00:59:34,620 --> 00:59:37,489
The list includes
drug possession, theft

870
00:59:37,522 --> 00:59:40,325
and even a few
prostitution charges.

871
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:42,228
It's pretty hard to find
the files, though,

872
00:59:42,261 --> 00:59:44,596
because she was a minor
when it all happened.

873
00:59:44,629 --> 00:59:47,198
She's been clean for
the past few years, though.

874
00:59:47,232 --> 00:59:49,335
Interesting.

875
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:52,004
But there was one incident
that dates back

876
00:59:52,036 --> 00:59:54,274
to when she was 12
that caught my attention.

877
00:59:55,640 --> 00:59:59,110
Looks like her stepfather
was abusing her.

878
00:59:59,143 --> 01:00:00,479
Sexually.

879
01:00:02,147 --> 01:00:05,116
So, one evening,

880
01:00:05,149 --> 01:00:09,020
she gathered up the guts
to stab him with some scissors.

881
01:00:09,053 --> 01:00:10,622
He didn't make it.

882
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:14,694
She bounced around
foster homes after that.

883
01:00:14,727 --> 01:00:16,529
Stories like that...

884
01:00:16,562 --> 01:00:18,931
They break my heart.

885
01:00:20,732 --> 01:00:23,468
I did contact
one of the foster mothers.

886
01:00:23,502 --> 01:00:26,439
She wasn't very helpful,

887
01:00:26,471 --> 01:00:29,609
but she did mention
that Katie was out east now.

888
01:00:29,642 --> 01:00:32,645
She reconnected with some
old childhood friends.

889
01:00:32,678 --> 01:00:35,647
Said something about
her dating one of them.

890
01:00:35,681 --> 01:00:37,083
Did you get his name?

891
01:00:37,116 --> 01:00:38,417
No.

892
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:39,685
She didn't remember.

893
01:00:40,752 --> 01:00:43,421
She did say he sounded
like bad news.

894
01:00:43,455 --> 01:00:44,723
It's good work, Quinn.

895
01:00:44,756 --> 01:00:46,491
Keep on it.

896
01:00:48,460 --> 01:00:49,929
You got it.

897
01:00:51,864 --> 01:00:53,099
Thanks.

898
01:01:11,616 --> 01:01:12,986
(coughs)

899
01:01:30,002 --> 01:01:32,138
I'm going
to have a bath.

900
01:01:35,841 --> 01:01:37,410
Right, then.

901
01:01:38,576 --> 01:01:40,812
Do you know that my mother's
only 33 years old?

902
01:01:44,415 --> 01:01:46,518
She raised me all by herself.

903
01:01:50,355 --> 01:01:52,825
We were so fucking poor.

904
01:01:56,495 --> 01:01:58,665
I never want to live
that way again.

905
01:01:59,997 --> 01:02:01,667
Yeah?

906
01:02:02,868 --> 01:02:04,570
(choked up):
It fucking sucked.

907
01:02:08,674 --> 01:02:11,377
My mom always worked.
We never had shit.

908
01:02:15,180 --> 01:02:17,382
All I ever wanted to do

909
01:02:17,415 --> 01:02:20,185
was try and fix it,
make it better.

910
01:02:23,455 --> 01:02:25,692
You can't
change the past, Brian.

911
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,828
What you need to do is figure
out a way to fix your future.

912
01:02:29,861 --> 01:02:31,663
That's what I'm doing.

913
01:02:31,696 --> 01:02:33,164
This is your future?

914
01:02:33,198 --> 01:02:34,933
It's not looking so good.

915
01:02:34,966 --> 01:02:37,169
You think I wanted
all this shit to happen?

916
01:02:37,201 --> 01:02:39,437
No, but the shit
did happen, so deal with it.

917
01:02:39,471 --> 01:02:41,239
I am dealing with it.

918
01:02:42,573 --> 01:02:44,409
I did what I needed to do.

919
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:48,848
Imagine living
your life knowing

920
01:02:48,881 --> 01:02:50,415
that your father
never wanted you.

921
01:02:52,317 --> 01:02:55,421
Hating your mother for all
the fucked up choices she made.

922
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:59,224
Thinking she hates you
because she's only 18 years old

923
01:02:59,257 --> 01:03:01,660
and she has
a 4-year-old son.

924
01:03:05,330 --> 01:03:07,433
I won't go back
to feeling like that.

925
01:03:08,901 --> 01:03:11,036
I'm sure it was horrible.

926
01:03:11,069 --> 01:03:13,672
But that should've
taught you something.

927
01:03:15,073 --> 01:03:18,377
You talk about your father and
how he ran out on your mother...

928
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:20,078
You don't know.

929
01:03:20,111 --> 01:03:21,814
Just what you've told me.

930
01:03:21,846 --> 01:03:25,250
Do you know what it's like
to look at every man you see

931
01:03:25,283 --> 01:03:26,651
and wonder,
could that be my dad?

932
01:03:27,852 --> 01:03:30,722
You do remember who
you're talking to, right?

933
01:03:30,756 --> 01:03:32,792
I was the one
who was yanked around

934
01:03:32,825 --> 01:03:35,060
from foster home
to foster home.

935
01:03:35,093 --> 01:03:36,796
We all have a past, baby,

936
01:03:36,828 --> 01:03:38,997
but it doesn't mean we let it
control our futures.

937
01:03:39,031 --> 01:03:40,767
This is my future.

938
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,236
Bear has given me
a future.

939
01:03:44,268 --> 01:03:45,705
That's pretty pathetic.

940
01:03:48,806 --> 01:03:52,344
And a minute ago, you wanted
to take his money and run.

941
01:03:57,114 --> 01:04:00,419
If Bear loves
and respects you so much,

942
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:03,221
why does he keep
taking your choices away?

943
01:04:04,489 --> 01:04:06,125
He's looking after me.

944
01:04:07,225 --> 01:04:09,327
My mother never did.

945
01:04:09,361 --> 01:04:11,096
He just made you
kill your best friend!

946
01:04:11,129 --> 01:04:12,931
You don't understand.

947
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:16,267
Not agreeing isn't the same
as not understanding, Brian.

948
01:04:16,301 --> 01:04:17,803
This is my business!

949
01:04:17,835 --> 01:04:19,337
This is my life.

950
01:04:20,638 --> 01:04:23,274
And I have to take it
very seriously.

951
01:04:23,308 --> 01:04:25,311
Those aren't even
your words!

952
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,011
What difference
does it make?

953
01:04:27,044 --> 01:04:29,314
That's the problem!

954
01:04:39,825 --> 01:04:40,993
And then...

955
01:04:42,527 --> 01:04:44,864
I don't know, somehow
he found out about Katie.

956
01:04:50,902 --> 01:04:52,738
You're doing great, Brian.

957
01:04:54,006 --> 01:04:56,007
What happened to Katie?

958
01:05:04,283 --> 01:05:06,018
(choked up):
I didn't hurt...

959
01:05:08,953 --> 01:05:10,355
I couldn't.

960
01:05:15,426 --> 01:05:17,729
Just tell us
what happened.

961
01:05:22,033 --> 01:05:25,103

967
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:59,037
<i>What did I tell you
about goddamn guests?</i>

968
01:05:59,071 --> 01:06:00,873
<i>Have you seen the news?</i>

969
01:06:00,906 --> 01:06:03,142
<i>You have a half hour

How did you find me?

1004
01:10:17,929 --> 01:10:20,132
I remembered you
from the diner.

1005
01:10:20,165 --> 01:10:21,899
I just followed the leads,

1006
01:10:21,933 --> 01:10:24,236
and then contacted
Agent Thomas.

1007
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:31,243
Chief Kimble is being
extremely humble right now.

1008
01:10:32,510 --> 01:10:35,414
She was top of our class,
back at Quantico.

1009
01:10:35,447 --> 01:10:37,416
If her father
hadn't gotten sick

1010
01:10:37,448 --> 01:10:40,152
and if she hadn't left
because of it,

1011
01:10:40,184 --> 01:10:41,819
she would
probably be

1012
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:44,123
one of the best field agents
in the country.

1013
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:49,227
No, things started
to go wrong for you

1014
01:10:49,260 --> 01:10:53,064
the moment you decided
to do your drug deal in Hope.

1015
01:10:56,367 --> 01:10:58,903
Well, at least
it didn't go to waste.

1016
01:11:01,238 --> 01:11:04,143
The thing is,
and no offense...

1017
01:11:05,109 --> 01:11:06,877
You're not
who we're after.

1018
01:11:06,911 --> 01:11:08,380
You gotta know that.

1019
01:11:10,282 --> 01:11:12,384
Anderson. Bear.

1020
01:11:13,917 --> 01:11:15,653
That's the goal here.

1021
01:11:17,121 --> 01:11:19,557
We've been working
this case for two years.

1022
01:11:20,992 --> 01:11:23,095
And he is
one piece of work.

1023
01:11:26,563 --> 01:11:28,466
You do what
you gotta do, right?

1024
01:11:29,968 --> 01:11:32,069
Self-preservation.

1025
01:11:32,103 --> 01:11:36,075
Look, you have to see that
this is your only way out.

1026
01:11:37,242 --> 01:11:39,144
I do what I gotta do, but...

1027
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:42,081
Bear's not going
to stand for this.

1028
01:11:43,314 --> 01:11:44,983
He's fucking ruthless.

1029
01:11:49,586 --> 01:11:51,089
He's got a son,
you know.

1030
01:11:52,256 --> 01:11:53,591
A real one.

1031
01:11:55,359 --> 01:11:57,929
Bear. Anderson.
He's got a kid.

1032
01:11:58,929 --> 01:12:00,999
Your point?

1033
01:12:02,267 --> 01:12:03,602

1035
01:12:07,272 --> 01:12:08,439
Nothing.

1036
01:12:09,773 --> 01:12:11,276
I guess
I don't have a point.

1037
01:12:13,944 --> 01:12:15,980
Brian.

1038
01:12:16,014 --> 01:12:19,818
I am your best friend
right now.

1039
01:12:21,219 --> 01:12:23,755
You do this and I...

1040
01:12:23,787 --> 01:12:27,992
We will do everything
in our power to help you.

1041
01:12:28,026 --> 01:12:29,594
It's all the same.

1042
01:12:29,626 --> 01:12:30,795
Isn't it?

1043
01:12:31,895 --> 01:12:33,364
Kid loses his family.

1044
01:12:33,398 --> 01:12:35,034
Who the fuck cares, right?

1045
01:12:35,966 --> 01:12:37,602
Means to an end?

1046
01:12:37,635 --> 01:12:39,504
Collateral damage?

1047
01:12:39,537 --> 01:12:41,773
Just another day
on the street.

1048
01:12:41,805 --> 01:12:43,207
Sins of the...

1049
01:12:44,209 --> 01:12:46,178
Whatever the fuck, man.

1050
01:12:47,379 --> 01:12:48,513
You'll do it.

1051
01:12:48,545 --> 01:12:50,148
Yeah.

1052
01:12:52,050 --> 01:12:54,319
I know exactly
what I need to do.

1053
01:12:54,352 --> 01:12:56,287
Great. Thank you.

1054
01:12:56,321 --> 01:12:57,989
Protect what matters.

1055
01:13:01,358 --> 01:13:03,828
But I need you to do
something for me, OK?

1056
01:13:06,331 --> 01:13:08,333
I'll wear the wire.
I'll do that.

1057
01:13:08,366 --> 01:13:09,368
But after...

1058
01:13:11,669 --> 01:13:14,172
I need to see them
one last time.

1059
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:20,245
My mom, Steven, Katie.

1060
01:13:22,246 --> 01:13:25,483
I need to visit the cemetery
before the shit hits the fan.

1061
01:13:25,517 --> 01:13:27,251
Unaccompanied.

1062
01:13:28,353 --> 01:13:30,522
And then, you guys
get what you get.

1063
01:13:31,889 --> 01:13:34,225
