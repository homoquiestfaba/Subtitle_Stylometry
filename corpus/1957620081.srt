00:00:00,961 --> 00:00:04,544
(cheerful bluegrass music)

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:15,135
♫ Lady in a turban in a cocaine tree

3
00:00:15,136 --> 00:00:19,106
♫ She does that dance so rhythmically

4
00:00:19,107 --> 00:00:21,192
♫ Cryin' and a singin'

5
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:23,622
♫ And havin' a time

6
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:27,502
♫ And don't that cocaine tree look fine

7
00:00:27,503 --> 00:00:32,017
♫ But you gotta put on your sailin' shoes

8
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:36,950
♫ Gotta put on your sailin' shoes

9
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:40,868
♫ Everyone will start to cheer

10
00:00:42,101 --> 00:00:46,268
♫ When you put on your sailin' shoes

11
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:11,204
♫ Jedidiah he got a dime

12
00:01:11,205 --> 00:01:15,643
♫ And he'll catch more fish every time

13
00:01:15,644 --> 00:01:19,686
♫ Well I've got a line
and you've got a pole

14
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:23,625
♫ I said I'll meet you at the fishing hole

15
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:27,995
♫ But you gotta put on your sailin' shoes

16
00:01:27,996 --> 00:01:32,163
♫ Gotta put on your sailin' shoes

17
00:01:34,034 --> 00:01:37,878
♫ Everyone will hip hooray

18
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:42,046
♫ When you put on your sailin' shoes

19
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,133
- [Announcer] Dr. Ovorsky, Dr. Ovorsky,

20
00:01:51,134 --> 00:01:53,217
please come to ward four.

21
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:59,335
(tinkling piano music)

22
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:15,504
- I thought you were gonna
get me out of this place.

23
00:02:15,505 --> 00:02:17,191
- I'm buying us a house.

24
00:02:17,192 --> 00:02:18,583
Brian you're gonna love it.

25
00:02:18,584 --> 00:02:20,709
It's on Spruce Street,
right in the middle of town.

26
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:23,737
Two bedrooms, one for you
downstairs, one for me upstairs.

27
00:02:23,738 --> 00:02:25,822
Beautiful porch for you to
watch the skiers coming down.

28
00:02:25,823 --> 00:02:28,470
- How long have I been hearing that Al?

29
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:30,138
Let me tell you a secret.

30
00:02:30,139 --> 00:02:32,876
You don't buy houses you paint 'em.

31
00:02:32,877 --> 00:02:35,249
You and your stoned out, ski bum friends,

32
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,667
you're totally out of touch with reality.

33
00:02:40,856 --> 00:02:44,059
How are you gonna get
the money to buy a house?

34
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:47,393
(upbeat drumming music)

35
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:58,185
♫ Really love the rain

36
00:02:58,186 --> 00:03:01,884
♫ Against the window

37
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:05,764
♫ Bringing back sweeter memories

38
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:09,765
♫ I feel a pain when I remember

39
00:03:12,674 --> 00:03:16,174
♫ How sweet it used to be

40
00:03:19,221 --> 00:03:22,554
♫ When we were together

41
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:27,682
♫ Everything was so grand

42
00:03:29,686 --> 00:03:33,565
♫ Now that we're talking

43
00:03:33,566 --> 00:03:37,623
♫ If there's one shot, I
got to show, I got to say

44
00:03:37,624 --> 00:03:41,761
♫ I really love the rain

45
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,845
♫ Against the window

46
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,941
♫ But you're never here with me

47
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:52,942
♫ I feel a pain when I remember

48
00:03:56,264 --> 00:04:00,097
♫ What a thrill it used to be

49
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,374
♫ Remember those feelings.

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:05,933
- Sunshine.

51
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:06,934
- Al Dean.

52
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,730
Got somethin' for me?

53
00:04:13,238 --> 00:04:16,233
For fingered lift, alright.

54
00:04:16,234 --> 00:04:17,234
Here you go.

55
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,714
- If you like this stuff,

56
00:04:19,715 --> 00:04:22,053
you're not gonna believe
what I got comin' in.

57
00:04:22,054 --> 00:04:24,716
My friend Lonnie, I told
you about Lonnie right?

58
00:04:24,717 --> 00:04:26,492
- His father's an ambassador right?

59
00:04:26,493 --> 00:04:30,304
- Diplomatic immunity, comes
through customs unchecked.

60
00:04:30,305 --> 00:04:34,472
He's gonna score me, get
this, Nepalese temple balls.

61
00:04:35,636 --> 00:04:36,543
- Shut up.

62
00:04:36,544 --> 00:04:38,119
- I am serious man.

63
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,023
It's got the monastery's
insignia right there on it

64
00:04:40,024 --> 00:04:41,420
so you know it's the real thing.

65
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:42,925
- Far out.

66
00:04:42,926 --> 00:04:45,990
- These monks, picture this,
they live at 18,000 feet

67
00:04:45,991 --> 00:04:47,894
right there in the
shadows of Mount Everest.

68
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:50,701
What they do is they take
the shake in marijuana plants

69
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:52,880
and they chew on it while they meditate.

70
00:04:52,881 --> 00:04:54,984
They're up there, they're
invoking the spirits,

71
00:04:54,985 --> 00:04:56,833
they're working that
keef into a gummy ball.

72
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,236
They they take the gummy
ball, mix it with opium

73
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:00,927
and they get these temple balls.

74
00:05:00,928 --> 00:05:02,146
- Cool.

75
00:05:02,147 --> 00:05:03,398
- Then they take them out and trade them

76
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:05,483
with other monasteries for chickens, pigs,

77
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:08,330
indoor plumbing, I dunno,
what ever else they need.

78
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:09,324
- Can you eat 'em?

79
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:10,677
- You're mowing my lawn.

80
00:05:10,678 --> 00:05:11,943
- What happens when you eat 'em?

81
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,194
- Temple balls!

82
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,731
- I like eatin' 'em.

83
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,075
- This stuff is the nectar of the gods.

84
00:05:18,076 --> 00:05:19,505
Guaranteed to improve your karma.

85
00:05:19,506 --> 00:05:22,554
One hit of this stuff
and boom, you're blessed.

86
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:26,558
And I need all the help
I can get with that shit.

87
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:28,846
- Howdy people, how are you doing today?

88
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:29,861
(cheering)

89
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,072
Everybody having a good time?

90
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:32,908
(cheering)

91
00:05:32,909 --> 00:05:34,486
Let's get to the pig chase.

92
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:35,828
You know the rules.

93
00:05:35,829 --> 00:05:38,001
First person to catch the little piggy

94
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:41,503
can either take home $50 or the porker.

95
00:05:41,504 --> 00:05:43,754
Contestants, are you ready?

96
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:49,896
Catch that pig!

97
00:05:49,897 --> 00:05:52,980
(upbeat banjo music)

98
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:18,601
(crowd cheering)

99
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:27,673
We have our winner.

100
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:31,445
(crowd cheering loudly)

101
00:06:31,446 --> 00:06:33,743
What's your name darlin'?

102
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:34,962
- Errol McNamara.

103
00:06:34,963 --> 00:06:36,268
- Errol.

104
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:38,104
- [Crowd Chanting] Errol,
Errol, Errol, Errol, Errol.

105
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:41,984
- What's it gonna be, the pig or $50?

106
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:45,881
- [Crowd Chanting] Pig,
pig, pig, pig, pig, pig.

107
00:06:45,882 --> 00:06:48,965
(upbeat blues music)

108
00:06:56,524 --> 00:07:00,524
♫ Further on down the road baby

109
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:05,304
♫ You'll accompany me

110
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:08,096
♫ Oh darlin'

111
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:12,097
♫ Further on down the road baby

112
00:07:13,102 --> 00:07:16,238
♫ You'll accompany me

113
00:07:16,239 --> 00:07:17,989
♫ Oh

114
00:07:20,809 --> 00:07:23,409
- Did I see you waitressing
at the Pick Beth?

115
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,830
- Yeah I started working there.

116
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,880
- Thought you were moving to San Fran?

117
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:29,964
- No, I put that on hold.

118
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,699
- You're not waiting over Tom?

119
00:07:35,786 --> 00:07:39,063
- Girl he was out of his
mind when Woody died.

120
00:07:39,064 --> 00:07:42,147
(upbeat blues music)

121
00:07:50,547 --> 00:07:53,047
- I wonder how he's doing now?

122
00:08:08,716 --> 00:08:11,163
- There is no question that
Ajax has all the ingredients

123
00:08:11,164 --> 00:08:15,331
to make us the destination
resort in North America.

124
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:21,663
I know it's hard to get to,
but it's part of our charm.

125
00:08:21,664 --> 00:08:22,664
The airport?

126
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,865
We've gathered all the
signatures, filed the petition,

127
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:28,934
it's on the ballot.

128
00:08:28,935 --> 00:08:31,146
The voters are gonna
approve it in November.

129
00:08:31,147 --> 00:08:32,815
It's a done deal.

130
00:08:32,816 --> 00:08:35,899
(video game beeping)

131
00:08:38,854 --> 00:08:40,465
This is definitely our year.

132
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:42,715
We'll be flying jets in
here before you know it.

133
00:08:42,716 --> 00:08:44,674
Say hi to Joan for me and you will be

134
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:48,258
hearing from me in the
middle of next week.

135
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:52,064
Bing fucking go.

136
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:55,935
Phil?

137
00:08:57,114 --> 00:08:58,114
Phil?

138
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,952
How are we doin' on the signatures?

139
00:09:01,953 --> 00:09:04,729
- [Phil] About a hundred shy.

140
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,379
- What are we doing in here?

141
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,682
- [Phil] Reloading?

142
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,405
- Very good.

143
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:12,656
Load, reload, sell, resell.

144
00:09:14,573 --> 00:09:16,987
Now put the gun down and
get out on the street

145
00:09:16,988 --> 00:09:20,179
and get us on the ballot so
we can make some real money.

146
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,934
(phone ringing)

147
00:09:22,935 --> 00:09:25,546
Kurt Hinney, Summit Development.

148
00:09:25,547 --> 00:09:26,547
Hello?

149
00:09:27,922 --> 00:09:28,922
Oh Victor.

150
00:09:31,259 --> 00:09:33,009
I closed on Thursday.

151
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:35,509
Oh it's great.

152
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,510
Two acres.

153
00:09:38,466 --> 00:09:40,049
Pristine mesa land.

154
00:09:42,238 --> 00:09:44,405
And the views are amazing.

155
00:09:45,864 --> 00:09:47,339
Sure.

156
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,477
It's zone commercial and residential.

157
00:09:50,478 --> 00:09:51,478
You know it.

158
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,385
Well I'm glad it worked out for you Vick.

159
00:09:57,386 --> 00:09:59,090
Let's keep in touch.

160
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,924
(harmonica music)

161
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,849
(crowd chattering)

162
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:16,915
- But it works.

163
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:18,835
- Down through Upper Chicken Gobbler,

164
00:10:18,836 --> 00:10:23,477
down through Lower Gobbler
and then drop the big.

165
00:10:23,478 --> 00:10:25,743
- It's about time.

166
00:10:25,744 --> 00:10:29,911
- You dropped all these 714's,
I was luded out of my head.

167
00:10:30,895 --> 00:10:34,266
Sunshine ragin', ride
that wave, ride that wave.

168
00:10:34,267 --> 00:10:38,434
I was laughing so hard, I
almost wet my panties man.

169
00:10:40,288 --> 00:10:41,574
- [Man] So what happened to you yesterday?

170
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:45,364
I was waiting around for half
an hour down at the retreat.

171
00:10:45,365 --> 00:10:47,758
- Hey big daddy, hey buddy come here,

172
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,060
I got something for you.

173
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:51,978
(blender whirring)

174
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:55,628
- Hey Beth.

175
00:10:55,629 --> 00:10:56,821
- Hey Al Dean.

176
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,565
- How're you doing sug?

177
00:10:58,566 --> 00:11:00,632
- Doing good, I gotta go to work though.

178
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:01,644
- Where are you going?

179
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:02,645
- I gotta go to work.

180
00:11:02,646 --> 00:11:03,714
- You just got here.

181
00:11:03,715 --> 00:11:04,564
- I know.

182
00:11:04,565 --> 00:11:05,728
Come by and see me at the Pick.

183
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:06,852
- I'll come by and see ya.

184
00:11:06,853 --> 00:11:07,853
- Okay.

185
00:11:09,771 --> 00:11:11,403
- [Radio] You know it's a winner.

186
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,432
Peter Polk earned a lifetime
supply of Werner Wiener Dogs

187
00:11:14,433 --> 00:11:18,022
in game six of last year's
Beaver Pelt Championship Series.

188
00:11:18,023 --> 00:11:20,773
Let's go to my now historic call.

189
00:11:22,429 --> 00:11:23,926
- Polk now steps up to the plate against

190
00:11:23,927 --> 00:11:26,594
the oh so intimidated Charlie Burke.

191
00:11:26,595 --> 00:11:28,824
Polk already with three
round triples on the evening,

192
00:11:28,825 --> 00:11:31,018
what could he possibly do for an encore?

193
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:34,699
Burke sets, he delivers, Polk
though with a monster strike.

194
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,691
It's deep, it could be, you
can call that ball a Hindu

195
00:11:37,692 --> 00:11:39,359
'cause it is Gandhi.

196
00:11:40,576 --> 00:11:42,352
Grizzlies, gonna repeat.

197
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:44,165
- Not if the Wool Socks can help it.

198
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,166
- Easy.

199
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:48,571
- Al Dean.

200
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,007
Errol, you shifty little Aussie.

201
00:11:54,008 --> 00:11:55,008
- Ah Easy.

202
00:11:57,403 --> 00:11:59,433
What the hell happened to you?

203
00:11:59,434 --> 00:12:01,337
- Long story.

204
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,177
It's all good though.

205
00:12:03,178 --> 00:12:05,236
Rito, what happened to you man?

206
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:07,701
- Wailed on my ankle in a mushroom grove.

207
00:12:07,702 --> 00:12:08,843
- [Tom] Ouch.

208
00:12:08,844 --> 00:12:10,801
- Tell me about it.

209
00:12:10,802 --> 00:12:11,635
- Hey Tommy, you wanna beer man?

210
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:12,542
- Yeah man.

211
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:15,279
Whoa, what's up with the pig?

212
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,745
- Errol won Porky
yesterday at the pig chase.

213
00:12:17,746 --> 00:12:19,574
Thinks we're gonna keep
him for the summer.

214
00:12:19,575 --> 00:12:20,792
- Bloody yes we are.

215
00:12:20,793 --> 00:12:22,800
I'm gonna build him a pen,
fatten him up for the summer,

216
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:24,056
and have a roast in the fall.

217
00:12:24,057 --> 00:12:26,389
- I really don't see why we want a pig.

218
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,711
- Sacrifice him to Pan and Bacchus.

219
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:29,907
- Sacrifice him to Ullr.

220
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:31,575
- [All] Praise Ullr.

221
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:34,386
- There is no way in hell

222
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:37,970
that I am living with
a pig for the summer.

223
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:41,709
- [Errol] After Woody's funeral,

224
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:43,816
we all thought you were gone for good.

225
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:46,354
- Just had to split Mac.

226
00:12:46,355 --> 00:12:48,053
I didn't know where I was goin', but.

227
00:12:48,054 --> 00:12:50,221
- Hey, no need to explain.

228
00:12:51,263 --> 00:12:53,743
Truth be known I was bloody bent.

229
00:12:53,744 --> 00:12:56,830
You could've at least dropped me a line.

230
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,056
Anyway, you picked a good season to leave.

231
00:12:59,057 --> 00:13:02,778
There's been bugger all snow
until the last couple of weeks.

232
00:13:02,779 --> 00:13:05,806
So you think you're gonna stick around?

233
00:13:05,807 --> 00:13:07,474
- Really just came back
to pack up my stuff

234
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:09,179
and put it in storage.

235
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,736
- Come on mate, you should
stay for the summer.

236
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,274
Listen, you can have your
old room back if you want it.

237
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:16,692
Why don't you think about it.

238
00:13:19,497 --> 00:13:21,927
Listen I gotta hit the sack.

239
00:13:21,928 --> 00:13:24,934
I'm tending bar at the Pick this summer.

240
00:13:24,935 --> 00:13:26,102
- Alright man.

241
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:38,838
- Hey Sully, it's good
to have you back mate.

242
00:13:43,342 --> 00:13:45,925
(pig snorting)

243
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:04,636
(distant whistling)

244
00:15:09,191 --> 00:15:10,795
- He's so cute.

245
00:15:10,796 --> 00:15:12,413
What are you gonna name him?

246
00:15:12,414 --> 00:15:13,375
- How about Floyd man?

247
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:15,894
- You can't name the pig Floyd.

248
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:18,071
The Poxy sisters named their pig Floyd.

249
00:15:18,072 --> 00:15:20,555
- Hey did you guys know
that Pigs have made

250
00:15:20,556 --> 00:15:23,384
important contributions
to American literature?

251
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:26,539
Pigs love to drink, that's
probably the reason I like 'em.

252
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,532
In fact pigs are the only
animals that would drink enough

253
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:29,491
to be classified as an alcoholic.

254
00:15:29,492 --> 00:15:32,178
- Tom, whatcha doing this weekend?

255
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:33,158
- Nothing much.

256
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,333
You wanna do something?

257
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,473
- Well I was thinking of going climbing.

258
00:15:37,474 --> 00:15:38,474
- Where?

259
00:15:39,631 --> 00:15:42,442
- How about the Van Winkle Wall?

260
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:43,765
- What are you trying to make me look bad?

261
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:45,361
I'm not in climbing shape.

262
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,884
- Sure you are.

263
00:15:46,885 --> 00:15:48,878
Come on, it'll be fun.

264
00:15:48,879 --> 00:15:50,188
- Yeah sure.

265
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:52,296
- But of course uh, Orwell
might be appropriate

266
00:15:52,297 --> 00:15:55,578
in honor of George and
his pigs from Animal Farm.

267
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,137
Remember Napoleon had that great line.

268
00:15:57,138 --> 00:15:59,948
"All animals are created equal,

269
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:02,704
"some are more equal than others."

270
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,445
I love that one.

271
00:16:04,446 --> 00:16:06,852
How about you Beth, any ideas for a name?

272
00:16:06,853 --> 00:16:08,235
- Hmm.

273
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:09,376
How about Hud?

274
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:10,699
Hud won a pig.

275
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,224
- How about Scrapple?

276
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:13,566
- Scrapple?

277
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,745
What the hell is scrapple?

278
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:15,598
- Exactly.

279
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,138
- Oh I've had scrapple before.

280
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:20,638
My mom used to give it to
us as kids, absolutely foul.

281
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,848
You think you're biting
into sausage, and it is not.

282
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:25,241
- But what's in it?

283
00:16:25,242 --> 00:16:28,018
- Nobody really knows
what's in scrapple man?

284
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,705
- Come on people.

285
00:16:29,706 --> 00:16:31,915
You Yanks invented the crap.

286
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:34,125
I had scrapple when I was
hitching through Pennsylvania.

287
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,994
It's like a cornmeal mash

288
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:40,237
and the meat and broth of the pork.

289
00:16:40,238 --> 00:16:42,505
Season it with onions, a
little salt and pepper,

290
00:16:42,506 --> 00:16:46,115
shape it into a loaf,
spice it up, and fry it.

291
00:16:46,116 --> 00:16:47,584
It's as gross as head cheese.

292
00:16:47,585 --> 00:16:48,568
- Cool.

293
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:50,776
- Sit Scrapple, sit.

294
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:52,190
Good piggy.

see what's in there?

343
00:20:01,058 --> 00:20:04,504
14 packages in the last three
months and no return address.

344
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:07,200
Now let's see what's in the package.

345
00:20:07,201 --> 00:20:09,403
- I know I got rights.

346
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:12,867
- Look, we can open it
now, or I can take you

347
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:15,120
and your hippy friend down to the station

348
00:20:15,121 --> 00:20:17,202
and we'll take a look at it there.

349
00:20:17,203 --> 00:20:18,769
- It's got nothing to do with him.

350
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:21,020
He's just giving me a ride.

351
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,054
- It's in his vehicle.

352
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:35,890
What's it gonna be?

353
00:20:35,891 --> 00:20:37,058
- You open it.

354
00:20:46,982 --> 00:20:49,732
(glass clinking)

355
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,854
You broke it!

356
00:20:52,855 --> 00:20:54,766
It's for my brother.

357
00:20:54,767 --> 00:20:55,890
He's in a VA hospital.

358
00:20:55,891 --> 00:20:57,462
Is that legal?

359
00:20:57,463 --> 00:21:00,380
Why don't you stop hassling me man.

360
00:21:06,832 --> 00:21:09,392
- I've been working on my own stuff.

361
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:10,994
Got a few solo gigs planned.

362
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,853
- Right on, where?

363
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:14,051
- The Pick mostly.

364
00:21:14,052 --> 00:21:15,143
- Far out.

365
00:21:15,144 --> 00:21:17,311
- Not for a couple weeks though.

366
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,103
You sticking around?

367
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:20,161
- I wasn't planning on it.

368
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:24,667
But I could sure use to
make some bread yanno?

369
00:21:24,668 --> 00:21:26,745
- Where would you go if you left?

370
00:21:26,746 --> 00:21:29,462
- I dunno, back east probably.

371
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:31,390
I'm not sure really.

372
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:33,678
I mean I could always go
to to work for the family.

373
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,346
The problem is, is I
can't stand the family.

374
00:21:40,225 --> 00:21:42,142
- I'd like you to stay.

375
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,221
I mean, if that makes any difference.

376
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,320
- I'll see what happens with Pedro.

377
00:21:49,321 --> 00:21:51,904
(upbeat music)

378
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:11,901
- Yeah, yeah so my
friends, they spend the day

379
00:22:11,902 --> 00:22:15,005
hanging out, kicking this bag around.

380
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:17,140
I dunno, it's about the
size of a golf ball.

381
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:18,774
Yeah full of beads.

382
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:20,366
Well no, there is no point.

383
00:22:20,367 --> 00:22:24,530
Nobody wins or loses or
anything, it's communism.

384
00:22:24,531 --> 00:22:25,418
Yeah.

385
00:22:25,419 --> 00:22:28,660
Well I guess the point is to
keep this thing in the air,

386
00:22:28,661 --> 00:22:30,210
all day long.

387
00:22:30,211 --> 00:22:31,211
Really.

388
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:34,018
Well I'm thinkin' we can make these things

389
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,943
for a nickel a piece in
Honduras or something.

390
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:39,924
Yeah, sell 'em for a buck.

391
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:40,925
Oh at least.

392
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:43,628
Well think about it.

393
00:22:43,629 --> 00:22:44,907
Yeah I gotta go.

394
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:46,853
Love you too Dad, bye.

395
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:47,859
- [Al] How's it going?

396
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,532
- Not much.

397
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:50,946
- How's the land pimpin' racket?

398
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:52,023
Sell any dirt today.

399
00:22:52,024 --> 00:22:53,304
- Actually somebody came in yesterday

400
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,855
asking about your place.

401
00:22:54,856 --> 00:22:55,746
They just want the lot though,

402
00:22:55,747 --> 00:22:58,356
they're gonna bulldoze that eye sore.

403
00:22:58,357 --> 00:22:59,190
- Good one.

404
00:22:59,191 --> 00:23:00,984
- Yeah, so, how are
things with your brother?

405
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:01,990
- I dunno.

406
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,681
Pretty good I guess.

407
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:05,234
They moved him out to a
place in Prescott so at least

408
00:23:05,235 --> 00:23:09,402
he's closer but, it'd be a
lot better if he were here.

409
00:23:10,993 --> 00:23:13,675
- How's my house on Spruce doing?

410
00:23:13,676 --> 00:23:14,679
- Well it might not be yours

411
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,523
if you don't make an offer soon.

412
00:23:16,524 --> 00:23:17,464
A couple came in just this morning

413
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:19,985
ready to start the paperwork.

414
00:23:19,986 --> 00:23:21,184
- What are they offering?

415
00:23:21,185 --> 00:23:22,185
- 35.

416
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:24,987
I don't think they're gonna
take it, they want 50.

417
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:28,571
But you need $7,500 to
make a bid yourself.

418
00:23:29,647 --> 00:23:33,314
- Kurt doesn't know I'm
interested, does he?

419
00:23:35,006 --> 00:23:37,903
- Let's do this ourselves.

420
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:39,766
Can you get the dough?

421
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:40,927
- Close.

422
00:23:40,928 --> 00:23:42,000
I'm gonna get it though.

423
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:44,221
- That a way Al, have a little vision.

424
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:46,777
- It's not the vision part
of this equation I'm having

425
00:23:46,778 --> 00:23:49,439
a problem with, it's the
reality that's trippin' me up.

426
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,417
- Yeah, but you know the thin line

427
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:53,915
between vision and reality, that's belief.

428
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,999
- You are scaring me man.

429
00:23:57,431 --> 00:23:58,268
You're not buying into Kurt's

430
00:23:58,269 --> 00:24:00,759
pseudo sales is life philosophy, are ya?

431
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:03,593
Besides, $7500 is not a thin line.

432
00:24:04,448 --> 00:24:06,781
$7500 is a big old fat line.

433
00:24:07,673 --> 00:24:09,923
(sniffing)

434
00:24:12,581 --> 00:24:14,355
- Phil, don't you have some business

435
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:16,028
to take care of on the street?

436
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,751
- Yeah, on my way.

437
00:24:17,752 --> 00:24:19,543
Hey Kurt do you know Al Dean?

438
00:24:19,544 --> 00:24:22,202
- Of course I do, he painted
my house last summer.

439
00:24:22,203 --> 00:24:23,203
- Right.

440
00:24:24,323 --> 00:24:27,475
- Hey Al, can I speak to you a moment?

441
00:24:27,476 --> 00:24:29,135
You got a minute?

442
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,136
- Yeah sure.

443
00:24:44,765 --> 00:24:46,608
So what's going on?

444
00:24:46,609 --> 00:24:48,284
- You know Toots right?

445
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:49,952
- Sure I know Toots.

446
00:24:51,014 --> 00:24:53,250
He split town didn't he?

447
00:24:53,251 --> 00:24:54,334
- Yes he did.

448
00:24:55,647 --> 00:24:56,647
- And?

449
00:24:57,505 --> 00:24:59,725
- And I'm lookin' for
someone to replace him.

450
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,636
You interested?

451
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:03,752
- Selling whiff?

452
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:07,319
- I've seen you operate Al,
you're strictly small time.

453
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,965
You could make a lot of
money working for me.

454
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,483
- Not my thing.

455
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:13,954
- Maybe you need to decide
what your thing is Al.

456
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:15,597
Risk reward ratio.

457
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,343
The bigger the risk,
the bigger the reward.

458
00:25:18,344 --> 00:25:20,495
Sure you can keep selling $20 lids,

459
00:25:20,496 --> 00:25:23,379
but where's it gonna get ya?

460
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:27,782
- Look Kurt, I'm doing
pretty good on my own.

461
00:25:27,783 --> 00:25:31,116
Is this what you brought me in here for?

462
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:35,502
- You'd be stupid not to think about it.

463
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,711
(blues guitar music)

464
00:26:07,597 --> 00:26:08,930
- You want some?

465
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:15,092
It's that killer weed Al gave you.

466
00:26:31,647 --> 00:26:34,230
(pig snorting)

467
00:27:21,225 --> 00:27:23,272
- Sexual attraction last four years tops.

468
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:24,229
How are you gonna spend your whole life

469
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:27,368
with someone you're not even attracted to.

470
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,451
- What have you been
reading Cosmo again Al?

471
00:27:29,452 --> 00:27:32,232
- There's that Mars and
Sag in the fifth house.

472
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:34,066
A lover with a temper.

473
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:38,972
- You have any idea what
she's talking about?

474
00:27:38,973 --> 00:27:40,056
- Not a clue.

475
00:27:44,351 --> 00:27:45,869
- Um two more beers.

476
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:48,120
- [Errol] Okay, you got it.

477
00:27:54,744 --> 00:27:57,252
- Hey Tom, how're ya doin'?

478
00:27:57,253 --> 00:27:58,253
- Hey Easy.

479
00:27:59,403 --> 00:28:00,403
- Al Dean.

480
00:28:02,237 --> 00:28:03,904
You got any pot man?

481
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:08,277
- Whoa, Tom, try to be cool.

482
00:28:08,278 --> 00:28:10,103
- Nah I wanna get ripped.

483
00:28:10,104 --> 00:28:13,226
Can you score me some grass?

484
00:28:13,227 --> 00:28:14,780
- You need to shut your trap Tommy.

485
00:28:14,781 --> 00:28:15,987
- No, you remember that bag of weed

486
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,405
you sold me back in November?

487
00:28:19,692 --> 00:28:20,992
- What is your problem man?

488
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:22,835
- That was really killer weed man.

489
00:28:22,836 --> 00:28:24,115
- Well I'm glad.

490
00:28:24,116 --> 00:28:24,949
- You're glad!?

491
00:28:24,949 --> 00:28:25,860
- You guys, come on, come on, come on.

492
00:28:25,861 --> 00:28:27,783
- You're glad!?

493
00:28:27,784 --> 00:28:28,784
He's glad.

494
00:28:29,576 --> 00:28:30,409
Did you hear that?

495
00:28:30,409 --> 00:28:31,242
He's glad.

496
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,075
- Take my table.

497
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:33,075
- Yeah.

498
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:36,551
- What was that all about?

499
00:28:37,608 --> 00:28:39,441
- I gave him that bag.

500
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,777
(slow banjo music)

501
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:16,423
(cheerful guitar music)

502
00:30:00,995 --> 00:30:03,662
(loud slurping)

503
00:30:05,793 --> 00:30:08,376
(pig snorting)

504
00:30:14,376 --> 00:30:17,107
- Fourth of July today Scraps.

505
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:20,060
Temple balls are finally comin' in.

506
00:30:20,061 --> 00:30:22,228
Gonna put me over the top.

507
00:30:23,371 --> 00:30:25,538
What do you think of that?

508
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:31,112
(mellow guitar music)

509
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:45,383
- You were really messed
up the other night.

510
00:30:48,703 --> 00:30:50,289
- I bricked.

511
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:51,457
- Yes you did.

512
00:30:52,986 --> 00:30:55,493
- Hey thanks for taking care of me.

513
00:30:55,494 --> 00:30:58,054
- Well you needed taking care of.

514
00:30:58,055 --> 00:30:59,055
- I know.

515
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:02,947
So you excited about tonight?

516
00:31:05,121 --> 00:31:06,349
- I dunno.

517
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:07,183
- Why not?

518
00:31:07,184 --> 00:31:09,016
You're gonna be great.

519
00:31:10,014 --> 00:31:11,137
What?

520
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:13,649
- Well I'm just a little nervous.

521
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:14,650
- Don't be.

522
00:31:17,063 --> 00:31:19,144
- Are you gonna be there?

523
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:20,145
- Of course.

524
00:31:22,149 --> 00:31:25,869
Why don't you play me something right now.

525
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,934
- No, uh uh, no.

526
00:31:27,935 --> 00:31:29,743
- Come on Beth, come on.

527
00:31:29,744 --> 00:31:31,091
- No.

528
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:31,925
- Come on.

529
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:33,771
(laughing)

530
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:34,855
- Okay, okay.

531
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,144
Okay, um.

532
00:31:38,414 --> 00:31:40,256
What do you wanna hear?

533
00:31:40,257 --> 00:31:41,090
- [Tom] I dunno.

534
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:41,923
What's your favorite song

535
00:31:41,924 --> 00:31:45,154
you've written in the last six months?

536
00:31:45,155 --> 00:31:48,322
(mellow guitar music)

537
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:00,703
♫ Rain comes down

538
00:32:02,222 --> 00:32:05,719
♫ It's never gonna stop no, no

539
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,945
♫ I hear the ticking of the pine

540
00:32:08,946 --> 00:32:11,778
♫ Well I'm moving down

541
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:13,959
♫ This dusty road

542
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,759
♫ The cold winds they are
blowing through my hair

543
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:21,369
♫ And I'm miles from my home

544
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:24,934
♫ I know this highway,
I'm sure I know it well

545
00:32:24,935 --> 00:32:26,419
- So after mom died, I said to myself,

546
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,094
Errol life is just way to short to end up

547
00:32:28,095 --> 00:32:30,175
at 60 with a gold watch and a pension.

548
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:31,664
Headed out looking for nirvana.

549
00:32:31,665 --> 00:32:35,484
- This might not be it, but
the backyard's not to bad eh?

550
00:32:35,485 --> 00:32:37,446
Can I get you something?

551
00:32:37,447 --> 00:32:40,228
- Scotch on the rocks and do me well.

552
00:32:40,229 --> 00:32:44,853
♫ But tonight I'm a
soul like a burning fire

553
00:32:44,854 --> 00:32:46,433
- Say uh, you wouldn't happen

554
00:32:46,434 --> 00:32:49,623
to know a Kurt Hinney would ya?

555
00:32:49,624 --> 00:32:52,765
- Well the thing about Ajax
is, it's a nice quiet town.

556
00:32:52,766 --> 00:32:56,946
We all live here together
alone minding our own business.

557
00:32:56,947 --> 00:33:01,114
But uh, I think you might
find him back in the bathroom.

558
00:33:02,033 --> 00:33:03,257
- Much obliged.

559
00:33:03,258 --> 00:33:04,258
- Thank you.

560
00:33:08,211 --> 00:33:11,544
(giggling and sniffing)

561
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:17,217
- See you back at the bar.

562
00:33:17,218 --> 00:33:18,301
- Okie dokie.

563
00:33:21,104 --> 00:33:22,604
- Well, excuse me.

564
00:33:28,306 --> 00:33:30,045
Kurt Hinney?

565
00:33:30,046 --> 00:33:32,347
- Yeah, and you're?

566
00:33:32,348 --> 00:33:34,181
- Cy Sloan from Aspen.

567
00:33:36,153 --> 00:33:38,200
- Oh my old stomping ground.

568
00:33:38,201 --> 00:33:40,969
- Yes, that's what I understand.

569
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,127
Glen Fisher told me to look you up.

570
00:33:43,128 --> 00:33:45,711
Said you were the king of Ajax.

571
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:50,765
Interested in some real estate.

572
00:33:50,766 --> 00:33:53,820
- Oh really, what are you interested in?

573
00:33:53,821 --> 00:33:54,821
- Mesa land.

574
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:59,503
- Who in the hell are you?

575
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,234
- I told you, Glen wanted me to see you.

576
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:03,735
I manage his club.

577
00:34:05,478 --> 00:34:07,951
- Oh he did, did he?

578
00:34:07,952 --> 00:34:09,351
I'm not really sure
what you want right now,

579
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:10,935
but I'm kinda busy.

580
00:34:12,082 --> 00:34:13,529
If you wanna talk business,
you can come by my office.

581
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,113
Summit Development.

582
00:34:19,718 --> 00:34:21,901
- [Radio] Sparky Styles on
in relief for the Grizzlies.

583
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:24,615
His wife, Sharon, is a pretty fine golfer.

584
00:34:24,616 --> 00:34:27,275
- [Tom] Hey man I owe you an apology.

585
00:34:27,276 --> 00:34:29,709
I was way out of line at
the Pick the other night.

586
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,232
- No need to apologize.

587
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:33,843
I know you're going
through some heavy shit.

588
00:34:33,844 --> 00:34:34,677
What I wanna know is if you and Beth

589
00:34:34,678 --> 00:34:36,983
went to the horizontal disco.

590
00:34:36,984 --> 00:34:39,031
- I'm not trying to get on Beth.

591
00:34:39,032 --> 00:34:41,246
- She is flush man.

592
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:42,699
- There's no doubt about that.

593
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,323
- And she's definitely into you.

594
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,851
- I don't think so man, we're buds.

595
00:34:47,852 --> 00:34:49,746
Hey, Socks win last night?

596
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:51,538
- Yeah they won in the 10th.

597
00:34:51,539 --> 00:34:54,149
Marsh went three for
four with two dingers.

598
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,026
- On a tear man.

599
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:58,859
Just wait 'til the wind starts
blowing out of Tubs Field.

600
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:02,768
- Socks are just like you
whiskey boy, can't keep it up.

601
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,287
- Guys wanna break for lunch?

602
00:35:04,288 --> 00:35:06,074
- [Al] No you go ahead,
we'll catch you later.

603
00:35:06,075 --> 00:35:08,242
- Alright, catch ya later.

604
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,414
- Philly Brandel's been comin'
by the house lookin' for ya.

605
00:35:15,415 --> 00:35:17,326
What you got going?

606
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:18,913
- Trying to score a place.

607
00:35:18,914 --> 00:35:20,521
- You don't have any money.

608
00:35:20,522 --> 00:35:22,241
- I got a lot of irons in the fire.

609
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,492
- Selling bags?

610
00:35:26,269 --> 00:35:28,248
- Look mister I was way out of line,

611
00:35:28,249 --> 00:35:29,460
I don't wanna talk about it.

612
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,286
- I wanna talk about it.

613
00:35:31,287 --> 00:35:33,982
- Well I don't like
hearing about it from you

614
00:35:33,983 --> 00:35:35,399
and you don't like
hearing about it from me,

615
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,550
so let's just drop it right.

616
00:35:37,551 --> 00:35:38,506
- What do you think you're gonna do,

617
00:35:38,507 --> 00:35:41,185
nickel and dime your way into a house?

618
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:44,221
- I'm not just gonna buy
the blueprint for life Tom.

619
00:35:44,222 --> 00:35:45,230
I'm trying to get some money together

620
00:35:45,231 --> 00:35:46,953
so I can do my own thing.

621
00:35:46,954 --> 00:35:48,814
- Yeah, pushing drugs.

622
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,510
- Selling lids of grass
does not make me a pusher.

623
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,385
I get a bag and it's gone in two days.

624
00:35:53,386 --> 00:35:54,219
- Listen to yourself.

625
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,809
What does it make you then?

626
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:56,802
- It's not like I'm mixing up sopa's

627
00:35:56,803 --> 00:35:57,995
in our bathtub or anything.

628
00:35:57,996 --> 00:36:00,299
I mean, it's grass, it's harmless.

629
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,300
- Harmless?

630
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,378
What if you get busted?

631
00:36:04,379 --> 00:36:07,143
Who's gonna take care of your brother?

632
00:36:07,144 --> 00:36:09,891
- Who's taking care of him now?

633
00:36:09,892 --> 00:36:10,725
Why don't you stop laying

634
00:36:10,726 --> 00:36:13,725
your head trips on me alright Sully?

635
00:36:28,614 --> 00:36:31,839
- So what are you in the market for?

636
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,330
- I was thinkin' five ki's.

637
00:36:34,331 --> 00:36:36,310
- You can move that much?

638
00:36:36,311 --> 00:36:39,587
- Oh yeah, it's not a problem.

639
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:41,089
If Aspen runs dry, I got contacts

640
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:44,757
in the Butte, Telluride,
all over the place.

641
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:48,496
You can get me the five?

642
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,914
- That's a lot of shit amigo.

643
00:36:52,559 --> 00:36:54,476
These things take time.

644
00:36:56,211 --> 00:36:57,405
Half the money up front,

645
00:36:57,406 --> 00:37:01,073
the other half upon
delivery, no exceptions.

646
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:04,494
- I can work with that.

647
00:37:05,597 --> 00:37:09,880
(tape voices rewinding swiftly)

648
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:11,962
- [Kurt] You can move that much?

649
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,123
Half the money up front,

650
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:16,791
the other half upon
delivery, no exceptions.

651
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,793
- Captain Colorado.

652
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,903
- Research Lewis, research.

653
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:31,654
(upbeat marching band music)

654
00:37:43,257 --> 00:37:44,340
- Eight Ball.

655
00:37:45,393 --> 00:37:46,977
What you got for me?

656
00:37:46,978 --> 00:37:48,088
- These are from Lonnie.

657
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:50,886
There's more where this came from.

658
00:37:50,887 --> 00:37:52,114
- About time.

659
00:37:52,115 --> 00:37:54,077
I paid that guy six months ago for these.

660
00:37:54,078 --> 00:37:56,911
- Hey they're well worth the wait.

661
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:07,542
- Are you sure?

662
00:38:07,543 --> 00:38:10,407
I mean there's no symbol
from the monastery on them.

663
00:38:10,408 --> 00:38:14,337
- [Lonnie] Hey it's the real shit daddy.

664
00:38:14,338 --> 00:38:15,342
- Alright.

665
00:38:15,343 --> 00:38:16,843
Thanks Eight Ball.

666
00:38:33,868 --> 00:38:36,701
(bluegrass music)

667
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,907
- Summit Mountain Studios.

668
00:38:48,734 --> 00:38:52,901
Okay get this, we're talking
a major recording studio

669
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:58,125
adjacent to an airport,
atop pristine mesa land.

670
00:39:00,117 --> 00:39:04,284
James Taylor, Taj Mahal, I
know 'em, they wanna do it.

671
00:39:05,715 --> 00:39:08,120
There is no question that
Ajax has all the ingredients

672
00:39:08,121 --> 00:39:12,288
to make us the destination
resort in North America.

673
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,440
Juerta, Klauss.

674
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:17,245
- Kurt.

675
00:39:20,239 --> 00:39:21,322
Are you okay?

676
00:39:22,516 --> 00:39:23,849
- Yeah I'm cool.

677
00:39:24,795 --> 00:39:26,979
- So who's the customer?

678
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,460
- He's an old friend from Aspen.

679
00:39:28,461 --> 00:39:29,505
He owns the Purple Rose.

680
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:33,280
Eagles, Buffet, Dirt
Band, they all play there.

681
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:36,775
- God you're such a star fucker.

682
00:39:36,776 --> 00:39:39,216
So why does he want so
much all of the sudden?

683
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:41,946
- He's afraid we're done, I
told him about the airport.

684
00:39:41,947 --> 00:39:43,114
Let's do this.

685
00:39:47,354 --> 00:39:51,572
- Well I've got quite a
bit sitting in Mexico.

686
00:39:51,573 --> 00:39:53,501
We could fly it in below
radar at night into Dallas,

687
00:39:53,502 --> 00:39:54,585
right Juerta?

688
00:39:57,647 --> 00:39:59,397
Run it right up here.

689
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:03,815
Who's gonna make the pickup?

690
00:40:03,816 --> 00:40:06,446
- I'll take care of it.

691
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,921
I've never let you down Klauss.

692
00:40:08,922 --> 00:40:10,252
- You feel good about this?

693
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:11,223
- Five ki's?

694
00:40:11,224 --> 00:40:14,665
I feel fucking great
about this Klauss, great.

695
00:40:14,666 --> 00:40:16,606
- We might be able to make this work.

696
00:40:16,607 --> 00:40:18,198
I'm gonna need some time
though to set it up.

697
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,199
- Perfect.

698
00:40:20,945 --> 00:40:21,945
- So?

699
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:24,831
- What?

700
00:40:25,947 --> 00:40:28,676
- You got something for me?

701
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:29,677
- Oh.

702
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:39,252
- Yeah.

703
00:40:40,778 --> 00:40:42,535
This little strip has been good to us.

704
00:40:42,536 --> 00:40:45,436
- This airport's gonna
keep being good to me.

705
00:40:45,437 --> 00:40:47,996
Could be good for you too Klauss.

706
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:51,255
I need some capitol to
close on some big deals.

707
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:54,481
Why don't you come in with me?

708
00:40:54,482 --> 00:40:56,205
- Real estate?

709
00:40:56,206 --> 00:40:57,456
Juerta lets go.

710
00:41:03,266 --> 00:41:04,837
- [Radio] A loss today by the
Grizzly Bears would put them

711
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:07,994
14 games back of the
league leading Wool Socks

712
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:09,696
halfway through the season.

713
00:41:09,697 --> 00:41:12,052
- Did you here what Martin
William said last night?

714
00:41:12,053 --> 00:41:13,037
Someone asked him if he thought that

715
00:41:13,038 --> 00:41:15,008
the Grizzlie's could catch the Wool Socks.

716
00:41:15,009 --> 00:41:15,842
You know what he said?

717
00:41:15,843 --> 00:41:17,754
He said, there ain't
no sense worrying about

718
00:41:17,755 --> 00:41:19,966
things you can't control.

719
00:41:19,967 --> 00:41:21,657
'Cause if you can't control 'em,

720
00:41:21,658 --> 00:41:24,063
there ain't no sense worrying about 'em.

721
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,408
Is that beautiful or what?

722
00:41:25,409 --> 00:41:27,545
You're probably a Socks fan huh Scraps?

723
00:41:27,546 --> 00:41:29,217
Feelin' pretty confident.

724
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:31,829
Well let me tell you somethin',
Socks don't have pitching.

725
00:41:31,830 --> 00:41:33,399
Pitching wins championships.

726
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,327
This has got the best farm
league in the country.

727
00:41:35,328 --> 00:41:36,929
Lou Lincoln was a Grizz.

728
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:39,013
Bet you didn't know that.

729
00:41:44,135 --> 00:41:47,940
- Phil, life is not a popularity
contest, so get over it

730
00:41:47,941 --> 00:41:49,807
because a positive mental attitude.

731
00:41:49,808 --> 00:41:52,368
- Equals other people's money.

732
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,487
And that money in your pocket is mine

733
00:41:54,488 --> 00:41:56,585
and I just gotta find a way to get it.

734
00:41:56,586 --> 00:41:57,695
- There you go Phil.

735
00:41:57,696 --> 00:42:01,972
I'm glad you appreciate those
nuggets I throw your way.

736
00:42:01,973 --> 00:42:04,020
Any walk-in traffic today?

737
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,021
- None.

738
00:42:10,796 --> 00:42:11,921
- Anything else?

739
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:13,918
- Well yeah, actually I
was wondering if you had

740
00:42:13,919 --> 00:42:17,861
any activity on the Mahoney
house over on Spruce?

741
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:20,148
- There's a $40,000 offer on the table.

742
00:42:20,149 --> 00:42:21,359
I think Mahoney's gonna bite.

743
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,193
Why?

744
00:42:22,194 --> 00:42:24,120
- Well Al Dean's been eyeing
it and you know his brother

745
00:42:24,121 --> 00:42:26,974
got all messed up in Vietnam
and is in a VA hospital.

746
00:42:26,975 --> 00:42:28,592
- Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you're breaking my heart.

747
00:42:28,593 --> 00:42:29,635
What's the point?

748
00:42:29,636 --> 00:42:30,968
- Look I'm trying to help him out.

749
00:42:30,969 --> 00:42:32,585
He's having a tough time
getting a loan and I thought,

750
00:42:32,586 --> 00:42:34,193
you know, maybe we could come up

751
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:37,694
with some creative financing or something.

752
00:42:40,713 --> 00:42:43,560
- Yeah I think I might
be able to help him out.

753
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,201
Tell him to come out to
my house this weekend,

754
00:42:45,202 --> 00:42:47,198
I've got some great financial sources.

755
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,032
- Oh that would mean a lot.

756
00:42:48,033 --> 00:42:49,703
Thanks Kurt.

757
00:42:49,704 --> 00:42:52,334
- That's our business Phil,
making dreams come true.

758
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:53,335
- Right.

759
00:42:56,397 --> 00:42:58,735
- It ain't natural, that's all I'm saying.

760
00:42:58,736 --> 00:43:01,986
(old time piano music)

761
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:04,139
Yes.

762
00:43:07,301 --> 00:43:11,468
- [Errol] Al Dean, you couldn't
hit the broadside of a barn.

763
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,519
- And look at monkeys.

764
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:17,301
They're the closest
species to humans right?

765
00:43:17,302 --> 00:43:21,789
Let me tell you somethin',
monkeys are not monotonous.

766
00:43:21,790 --> 00:43:25,592
You see, each male monkey
wants to bang whatever he can.

767
00:43:25,593 --> 00:43:27,862
And the female monkeys only
wanna bang the strongest

768
00:43:27,863 --> 00:43:31,910
male monkey because they want
their babies to be strong.

769
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:34,948
The weak, nerdy, lame
monkeys, they never get laid.

770
00:43:34,949 --> 00:43:37,948
But the alpha monkey gets
to nail whoever he wants

771
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:42,116
because all the babe monkeys
want his super sperm.

772
00:43:43,977 --> 00:43:47,014
- [Errol] Pitch the ball already.

773
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:48,804
Yeah like that Al Dean,
except over the plate.

774
00:43:48,805 --> 00:43:53,653
- A little Charles Darwin
there, survival of the fittest.

775
00:43:53,654 --> 00:43:57,192
- And that is why the monkeys
fight so hard to be the

776
00:43:57,193 --> 00:44:01,360
alpha monkey, because only the
alpha monkey gets any booty.

777
00:44:05,717 --> 00:44:07,785
- [Errol] You go Al Dean, stick it to 'em.

778
00:44:07,786 --> 00:44:10,908
- Wait, what do the other monkeys do?

779
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:13,076
- They indulge themselves.

780
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,617
- Shut up.

781
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:20,598
- Why do you think they
call it spankin' the monkey?

782
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:22,646
- Monkey love my ass.

783
00:44:22,647 --> 00:44:25,360
Listen, I hate to break
it to you, you wanker,

784
00:44:25,361 --> 00:44:28,176
but we're mammals that
adapted to life on land.

785
00:44:28,177 --> 00:44:29,435
- So what's your point Errol?

786
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:34,043
- My point is that we're more
like dolphins than monkeys.

787
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:34,877
- Dolphins?

788
00:44:34,877 --> 00:44:35,710
- Dolphins.

789
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,543
Dolphins are mammals.

790
00:44:36,543 --> 00:44:37,376
Am I right?

791
00:44:37,377 --> 00:44:40,184
They breathe in air,
drink their mothers milk.

792
00:44:40,185 --> 00:44:41,018
- They do?

793
00:44:41,018 --> 00:44:41,851
- Yeah.

794
00:44:41,852 --> 00:44:43,956
Uh look at our skin, we have skin not fur.

795
00:44:43,957 --> 00:44:44,993
Am I right?

796
00:44:44,994 --> 00:44:45,903
- Yeah he's right.

797
00:44:45,904 --> 00:44:48,411
- People are born with webbed
appendages all the time.

798
00:44:48,412 --> 00:44:50,066
Next time you're looking in a mirror

799
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:52,182
look at the similarity
between your ugly schnozz

800
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:54,247
and a dolphin's blowhole.

801
00:44:54,248 --> 00:44:55,081
What else?

802
00:44:55,082 --> 00:44:58,239
Oh saline content in the womb
is exactly that of the ocean.

803
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,835
- Errol you're changing the subject.

804
00:45:00,836 --> 00:45:02,235
- Hang on a second.

805
00:45:02,236 --> 00:45:03,986
I'm not finished yet.

806
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:07,150
But perhaps most important,
and most relevant to

807
00:45:07,151 --> 00:45:11,055
this conversation, dolphins
are monogamous, is the word,

808
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:13,769
not monotonous dickwad, and
they're known to mate for life.

809
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,803
So you go ahead and pork
like King Kong if you want,

810
00:45:15,804 --> 00:45:20,274
I'm gonna go swim with
my little friend Flipper.

811
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:22,544
(laughing)

812
00:45:22,545 --> 00:45:23,909
- Dolphins are mammals?

813
00:45:23,910 --> 00:45:25,818
Dolphins are mammals?

814
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:28,479
- Errol, I mean wolves
and loons are monogamous.

815
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,815
But dolphins?

816
00:45:29,816 --> 00:45:33,125
- Listen mate, if there is one
thing I learned on walkabout

817
00:45:33,126 --> 00:45:34,679
it's that you should never let the truth

818
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,948
get in the way of a good story.

819
00:45:36,949 --> 00:45:38,199
- Amen brother.

820
00:45:41,062 --> 00:45:43,860
- Oh uh, Kurt wants to talk to you.

821
00:45:43,861 --> 00:45:45,206
- Why?

822
00:45:45,207 --> 00:45:48,089
- Well I set up a meeting
about the house on Spruce.

823
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:49,390
- Ah man.

824
00:45:49,391 --> 00:45:53,298
I thought we agreed
not to go through Kurt?

825
00:45:53,299 --> 00:45:57,053
- Come on look alive, you
guys could've had that.

826
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,841
- Look Al, the clock's ticking.

827
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:02,856
The Mahoneys want out and they're
considering a $40,000 bid.

828
00:46:02,857 --> 00:46:04,302
- You know how I feel about Kurt man.

829
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,900
- Yeah, but he thinks he can help you.

830
00:46:06,901 --> 00:46:08,300
- Yeah I bet he does.

831
00:46:08,301 --> 00:46:11,355
- Look just go by his house.

832
00:46:11,356 --> 00:46:12,356
Sorry.

833
00:46:13,284 --> 00:46:15,161
- I gotta to his house now?

834
00:46:15,162 --> 00:46:19,871
- Yeah just to, you're
being obtuse about this.

835
00:46:19,872 --> 00:46:23,955
Obtuse, ridic, look do
you want the house or not?

836
00:46:24,939 --> 00:46:28,939
Alright go, don't go,
it's up to, just whatever.

837
00:46:30,505 --> 00:46:32,036
- Three outs.

838
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:34,620
(serene music)

839
00:47:48,481 --> 00:47:49,911
- I had a lot of fun today.

840
00:47:49,912 --> 00:47:51,245
- Yeah so did I.

841
00:47:54,831 --> 00:47:56,998
I should probably go, huh?

842
00:47:58,705 --> 00:48:00,455
- Why don't you stay?

843
00:48:04,781 --> 00:48:08,198

Tom?

865
00:49:23,356 --> 00:49:24,356
- Woody?

866
00:49:25,353 --> 00:49:27,853
- What are you thinkin' about?

867
00:49:29,342 --> 00:49:30,455
- You.

868
00:49:30,456 --> 00:49:31,873
- Oh, bad timing.

869
00:50:04,755 --> 00:50:07,127
- [Radio] So the bases are
stacked here in the seventh,

870
00:50:07,128 --> 00:50:09,471
the game tied four a piece, only one out.

871
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:12,462
If the Socks cannot hold
onto this they will leave

872
00:50:12,463 --> 00:50:14,698
the door open for the
Grizzly Bears to take

873
00:50:14,699 --> 00:50:18,671
a four game lead with only
two weeks left in the season.

874
00:50:18,672 --> 00:50:20,876
Here's the payoff pitch to Chris Samuels.

875
00:50:20,877 --> 00:50:22,497
- Hey Mac, two more.

876
00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:23,331
- [Errol] Two?

877
00:50:23,332 --> 00:50:24,511
Gotcha.

878
00:50:24,512 --> 00:50:28,264
- Grizzlies have won six
straight against the Socks.

879
00:50:28,265 --> 00:50:31,628
They are choking like a
bunch of rookie pole smokers.

880
00:50:31,629 --> 00:50:33,130
- You're killin' me.

881
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:34,973
- Fraum couldn't catch 'em now.

882
00:50:34,974 --> 00:50:36,335
- I mean you know they're
gonna face each other

883
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,965
in the Beaver Pelt Series again.

884
00:50:38,966 --> 00:50:41,549
- And the Socks are going down.

885
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:45,339
(pig snorting)

886
00:50:47,996 --> 00:50:50,579
(groovy music)

887
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:53,005
(loud crunching)

888
00:51:58,754 --> 00:52:02,504
(helicopter blades whirring)

889
00:52:04,318 --> 00:52:07,401
(odd tinkling music)

890
00:52:10,137 --> 00:52:12,804
(bells ringing)

891
00:52:24,165 --> 00:52:26,915
(engine revving)

892
00:52:39,014 --> 00:52:40,191
- [Al] Oh no.

893
00:52:40,192 --> 00:52:41,025
- [Tom] Look at this place.

894
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:41,858
- [Al] Please no.

895
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:42,903
Oh my god.

896
00:52:42,904 --> 00:52:43,759
(laughing)

897
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,345
Oh god.

898
00:52:45,346 --> 00:52:46,346
Oh man.

899
00:52:48,128 --> 00:52:50,461
(screaming)

900
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:58,369
- [Sunshine] What's going on with Tom?

901
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,856
- I dunno.

902
00:52:59,857 --> 00:53:01,781
We got together about two weeks ago

903
00:53:01,782 --> 00:53:04,072
and we haven't talked since.

904
00:53:04,073 --> 00:53:05,073
- Typical.

905
00:53:05,813 --> 00:53:09,704
I dunno I mean, I think
he's bringing you down.

906
00:53:09,705 --> 00:53:10,796
You outta dump him.

907
00:53:10,797 --> 00:53:13,285
I mean I love Easy, I do.

908
00:53:13,286 --> 00:53:18,152
But he's obviously got some
serious shit to work through.

909
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,922
- I say you stick it out.

910
00:53:19,923 --> 00:53:22,961
His Sun, Venus, and Mercury
are all in the seventh house

911
00:53:22,962 --> 00:53:25,388
so relationships are in
the forefront for him.

912
00:53:25,389 --> 00:53:28,713
He's got his Mars and his
moon in the 12th house,

913
00:53:28,714 --> 00:53:30,832
so he doesn't know what he wants.

914
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,500
He just needs some time, sister.

915
00:53:34,347 --> 00:53:35,781
- I'm afraid he's going a number on you.

916
00:53:35,782 --> 00:53:37,164
I say fuck him.

917
00:53:37,165 --> 00:53:39,774
He'll come crawling back.

918
00:53:39,775 --> 00:53:41,345
Check this one out babe.

919
00:53:41,346 --> 00:53:42,915
- [Beth] Al Dean will love that.

920
00:53:42,916 --> 00:53:45,833
- He's a Leo, those are his colors.

921
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:52,625
- Phil's not here.

922
00:53:53,481 --> 00:53:55,937
- [Al] I'm not here to see Phil.

923
00:53:55,938 --> 00:53:57,021
- Is that so?

924
00:53:59,932 --> 00:54:02,303
- [Al] What's going on
with the Spruce house?

925
00:54:02,304 --> 00:54:05,136
- The Mahoneys are ready to move.

926
00:54:05,137 --> 00:54:07,220
- [Al] Well then so am I.

927
00:54:12,442 --> 00:54:14,275
- Let's talk business.

928
00:54:17,748 --> 00:54:19,950
- [Al] What do I gotta do?

929
00:54:19,951 --> 00:54:23,107
- One pick up, one drop off.

930
00:54:23,108 --> 00:54:26,358
(police radio chatter)

931
00:54:27,763 --> 00:54:29,211
(knocking on door)

932
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:31,712
- [Sheriff] Hey, anybody home?

933
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,327
Stinkin' hippies.

934
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:16,185
(groovy music)

935
00:55:23,218 --> 00:55:25,801
(odd laughter)

936
00:55:34,525 --> 00:55:35,549
- [Errol] Hey Beth, you wanna see

937
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:38,800
if that sap around the corner's hungry?

938
00:55:40,704 --> 00:55:41,704
- Hi.

939
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:46,770
- So you wanna order?

940
00:55:50,567 --> 00:55:52,067
- Yeah lemme look.

941
00:55:58,334 --> 00:56:00,688
So what've you been doin'?

942
00:56:00,689 --> 00:56:01,689
- Not much.

943
00:56:02,921 --> 00:56:03,921
You?

944
00:56:06,014 --> 00:56:08,300
- Been on a bad head trip.

945
00:56:08,301 --> 00:56:10,619
- Well it's just been
a joyride for me Tom.

946
00:56:10,620 --> 00:56:13,037
- Look, I've been an asshole.

947
00:56:13,914 --> 00:56:15,081
- You said it.

948
00:56:16,851 --> 00:56:18,268
- Beth I'm sorry.

949
00:56:19,136 --> 00:56:20,136
- Don't be.

950
00:56:25,999 --> 00:56:27,916
- Look I was wondering.

951
00:56:30,283 --> 00:56:34,324
Wanna go to the hot springs this weekend?

952
00:56:34,325 --> 00:56:37,125
- I can't, I got a gig Saturday.

953
00:56:37,126 --> 00:56:38,709
- How about Friday?

954
00:56:40,454 --> 00:56:44,618
Come on, when was the last
time you got out of the valley?

955
00:56:44,619 --> 00:56:46,649
- Well I was gonna go climbing.

956
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,650
- With who?

957
00:56:48,713 --> 00:56:49,713
- Paul.

958
00:56:53,442 --> 00:56:54,892
What I can't go climbing?

959
00:56:54,893 --> 00:56:58,168
I'm supposed to sit around and
wait while you blow me off?

960
00:56:58,169 --> 00:56:59,586
- I haven't been.

961
00:57:00,707 --> 00:57:02,874
No that's fine, obviously.

962
00:57:04,245 --> 00:57:05,828
So how about after?

963
00:57:08,683 --> 00:57:12,850
- Um I dunno I think, I think
Paul might wanna nail me.

964
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:15,980
I'm kidding.

965
00:57:18,954 --> 00:57:21,704
Look, let me think about it okay?

966
00:57:28,002 --> 00:57:29,585
So you wanna order?

967
00:57:30,955 --> 00:57:32,288
- I already ate.

968
00:57:36,569 --> 00:57:37,569
- Scrapple.

969
00:57:39,398 --> 00:57:41,920
Having consumed 22 Nepalese temple balls,

970
00:57:41,921 --> 00:57:45,004
I now declare you the Dalai pig Lama.

971
00:57:46,669 --> 00:57:50,169
- Resurrected after a most fitful slumber.

972
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:54,192
- The dharma pig has risen.

973
00:57:59,554 --> 00:58:01,192
- Hey maybe we should keep
him through the winter.

974
00:58:01,193 --> 00:58:02,574
- Are you kidding me?

975
00:58:02,575 --> 00:58:04,093
Deano's been ready to kill porky here

976
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:07,010
since Scraps ate his cash and his stash.

977
00:58:07,011 --> 00:58:08,376
This little piggy's going to market.

978
00:58:08,377 --> 00:58:09,210
Aren't you buddy?

979
00:58:09,211 --> 00:58:10,954
Living on borrowed time.

980
00:58:10,955 --> 00:58:13,053
- Yeah but do we have to eat her?

981
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:14,896
I mean I feel more comfortable not being

982
00:58:14,897 --> 00:58:17,593
on a first name basis with my dinner.

983
00:58:17,594 --> 00:58:20,101
- Oh come on Sully, we
eat meat all the time.

984
00:58:20,102 --> 00:58:21,893
Now you're just seeing
where it comes from.

985
00:58:21,894 --> 00:58:26,061
- I know that, I'd just rather
not meet the meat I eat.

986
00:58:27,202 --> 00:58:28,202
- Hey Sully.

987
00:58:29,045 --> 00:58:32,863
Maybe you should take
him to the spirit world?

988
00:58:32,864 --> 00:58:34,233
- The canyons?

989
00:58:34,234 --> 00:58:35,984
- I got some shrooms.

990
00:58:39,473 --> 00:58:41,946
The way I see it, Scraps
was probably some wise sage

991
00:58:41,947 --> 00:58:45,394
in his last life, so he's
just being tested in this one.

992
00:58:45,395 --> 00:58:48,688
He's in a transition period is all.

993
00:58:48,689 --> 00:58:50,275
- Oh no.

994
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:51,436
- What?

995
00:58:51,437 --> 00:58:52,528
- Fucked up.

996
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,529
- What?

997
00:58:54,338 --> 00:58:56,607
- I'm supposed to go to the
hot springs with Beth today.

998
00:58:56,608 --> 00:59:00,157
- Oh she is gonna be dark on you.

999
00:59:00,158 --> 00:59:01,420
You wanna turn back?

1000
00:59:01,421 --> 00:59:03,338
- I can't believe that.

1001
00:59:04,339 --> 00:59:06,455
By the time we get back.

1002
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:09,132
Hey pull over, I'll call her.

1003
00:59:09,133 --> 00:59:11,800
(phone ringing)

1004
00:59:23,110 --> 00:59:25,027
God you're such a dick.

1005
00:59:31,811 --> 00:59:34,811
(upbeat rock music)

1006
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:12,322
- You do know you're
gonna die soon, don't you?

1007
01:00:14,071 --> 01:00:15,604
(giggling)

1008
01:00:15,605 --> 01:00:17,518
Of course you don't, you're a pig.

1009
01:00:17,519 --> 01:00:19,769
(laughing)

1010
01:00:23,151 --> 01:00:24,225
You dumb pig.

1011
01:00:24,226 --> 01:00:27,126
(snorting)

1012
01:00:27,127 --> 01:00:30,028
I mean, seems to me you're aware

1013
01:00:30,029 --> 01:00:32,446
of what is going on Scrapple.

1014
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,137
But you're not really
aware that you're gonna die

1015
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:40,814
because I mean, let's face
it if you were aware of life

1016
01:00:40,815 --> 01:00:43,015
then you would be aware of death.

1017
01:00:43,016 --> 01:00:43,921
Right?

1018
01:00:43,922 --> 01:00:44,978
Am I right?

1019
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,787
Are you listening to me?

1020
01:00:46,788 --> 01:00:48,425
Are you listening to me?

1021
01:00:48,426 --> 01:00:49,601
I don't think you are,

1022
01:00:49,602 --> 01:00:52,112
I think you're more
interested in food right now.

1023
01:00:52,113 --> 01:00:54,696
(groovy music)

1024
01:01:29,847 --> 01:01:32,321
- Tom I gotta tell it to you straight.

1025
01:01:32,322 --> 01:01:34,905
You are screwing everything up.

1026
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:39,286
Do you love Beth?

1027
01:01:42,084 --> 01:01:43,251
Then tell her.

1028
01:01:44,678 --> 01:01:48,178
You wanna free yourself, then set me free.

1029
01:02:08,452 --> 01:02:11,119
(water rushing)

1030
01:02:31,127 --> 01:02:32,127
- Get out.

1031
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,323
(giggling)

1032
01:02:36,324 --> 01:02:37,824
How are you doing?

1033
01:02:39,069 --> 01:02:40,069
- Good.

1034
01:02:45,899 --> 01:02:48,783
Here I made a sandwich for you.

1035
01:02:48,784 --> 01:02:50,534
- Thank I'm starving.

1036
01:02:52,282 --> 01:02:53,561
- You okay?

1037
01:02:53,562 --> 01:02:54,562
- Wow.

1038
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:59,500
- Man you look as ripped as I feel.

1039
01:03:00,334 --> 01:03:01,667
How's your buzz?

1040
01:03:03,785 --> 01:03:04,785
- Good.

1041
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,183
Got a little heavy there for awhile but.

1042
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:13,383
I mean I haven't tripped since.

1043
01:03:15,954 --> 01:03:16,954
- Woody?

1044
01:03:21,176 --> 01:03:22,676
- I loved her man.

1045
01:03:24,811 --> 01:03:25,811
- I know.

1046
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:30,664
- You know after all that weight though,

1047
01:03:30,665 --> 01:03:34,165
I had this one moment of absolute clarity.

1048
01:03:36,569 --> 01:03:39,078
I had it all figured out.

1049
01:03:39,079 --> 01:03:41,655
- I love it when that happens.

1050
01:03:41,656 --> 01:03:44,406
So tell me, what is it all about?

1051
01:03:47,851 --> 01:03:52,424
♫ I don't wanna think
about tomorrow right now

1052
01:03:52,425 --> 01:03:54,842
♫ No I don't

1053
01:03:56,059 --> 01:04:00,226
♫ And you don't wanna talk
about yesterday yeah, yeah

1054
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:08,641
♫ Just look me in the eyes
and tell me that you love me

1055
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:13,468
♫ Right now

1056
01:04:13,469 --> 01:04:17,636
♫ Give me some of that
sweet, tender loving today

1057
01:04:20,721 --> 01:04:22,769
♫ I want you to give me

1058
01:04:22,770 --> 01:04:27,121
♫ Some of that sweet tender loving today

1059
01:04:27,122 --> 01:04:29,539
♫ Yeah, yeah

1060
01:04:30,859 --> 01:04:35,026
♫ Give me some of that
sweet tender, loving today

1061
01:04:41,867 --> 01:04:46,034
(audience cheering and applauding)

1062
01:04:46,919 --> 01:04:50,336
(upbeat bluegrass music)

1063
01:05:13,287 --> 01:05:15,914
- Missed you at the hot springs.

1064
01:05:15,915 --> 01:05:16,905
- Beth I'm so sorry.

1065
01:05:16,906 --> 01:05:19,004
- Yeah just don't apologize.

1066
01:05:19,005 --> 01:05:21,905
You always fucking apologize.

1067
01:05:21,906 --> 01:05:23,543
- Look it was completely spontaneous.

1068
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,377
Errol and I just.

1069
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,227
- I don't wanna hear about it.

1070
01:05:27,228 --> 01:05:28,067
- I tried to call.

1071
01:05:28,068 --> 01:05:29,653
- I'm sure you did.

1072
01:05:29,654 --> 01:05:31,565
You know maybe we should just keep going

1073
01:05:31,566 --> 01:05:32,981
the way we're going.

1074
01:05:32,982 --> 01:05:35,080
You know, I'm really
writing some great songs,

1075
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:37,331
this would really work out.

1076
01:05:40,046 --> 01:05:43,716
Look I've thought a lot about this.

1077
01:05:43,717 --> 01:05:47,129
Woody would want you
and me to be together.

1078
01:05:47,130 --> 01:05:49,213
I mean she would love it.

1079
01:05:50,202 --> 01:05:52,659
Don't you believe that?

1080
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:54,570
- Yeah that's.

1081
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:56,328
I mean you make it sound like it's easy.

1082
01:05:56,329 --> 01:05:59,746
- No, not easy Tom, I know it's not easy.

1083
01:06:01,380 --> 01:06:03,274
- You don't understand.

1084
01:06:03,275 --> 01:06:05,442
- Then make me understand.

1085
01:06:06,475 --> 01:06:09,930
Tell me what's going on with you.

1086
01:06:09,931 --> 01:06:12,489
'Cause if you can't, don't come back.

1087
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:15,836
This shit is really getting old.

1088
01:06:15,837 --> 01:06:16,837
- Beth.

1089
01:06:23,175 --> 01:06:25,581
- Uh Cy Sloan please.

1090
01:06:25,582 --> 01:06:27,082
Uh no that's okay.

1091
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,539
Tell him that Kurt Hinney

forwarding the mesa land

1094
01:06:38,808 --> 01:06:41,475
(low key music)

1095
01:06:52,602 --> 01:06:54,116
- Hey Strike's how's Hawaii?

1096
01:06:54,117 --> 01:06:57,854

Hey Mac, can I borrow your truck tomorrow?

1101
01:07:06,301 --> 01:07:09,237
- I'm sorry mate, it's in

1102
01:07:09,238 --> 01:07:11,541

1103
01:07:11,542 --> 01:07:12,792
- Only in Ajax.

1104
01:07:16,846 --> 01:07:19,392
- Hey Tom, you wanna kick?

1105
01:07:19,393 --> 01:07:20,226
- Nah man.

1106
01:07:20,227 --> 01:07:23,347
- Easy, can I borrow your bike tomorrow?

1107
01:07:23,348 --> 01:07:24,358

1108
01:07:24,359 --> 01:07:25,859
- [Al] Thanks man.

1109

What's up with Easy?

1110
01:07:32,602 --> 01:07:33,592
- I don't think he's all that excited

1111
01:07:33,593 --> 01:07:35,247
about us roasting Scraps.

1112
01:07:35,248 --> 01:07:37,329
- [Al] This roast is
gonna be unbelievable,

1113
01:07:37,330 --> 01:07:38,626
whole town's gonna be there.

1114
01:07:38,627 --> 01:07:39,633
How many barrels you get?

1115
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:40,742
- [Errol] We got five already

1116
01:07:40,743 --> 01:07:42,001
and we still gotta get one more.

1117
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:43,252
Oh and the tap.

1118
01:07:47,706 --> 01:07:50,999
Six barrels, can you pick that up Al?

1119
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,602
- I'm kinda busy tomorrow.

1120
01:07:52,603 --> 01:07:54,173
- Come on man I dug the bloody pit,

1121
01:07:54,174 --> 01:07:56,375
least you can do is pick up one keg.

1122
01:07:56,376 --> 01:07:57,399
- [Al] On one condition.

1123
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,373
- What's that?

1124
01:07:58,374 --> 01:07:59,975
- [Al] I get to kill that pig.

1125
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:01,581
- [Errol] Deal.

1126
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:02,665

1127
01:08:08,408 --> 01:08:09,575
- Sorry buddy.

1128
01:08:13,409 --> 01:08:16,103
Come on Scraps I got a plan.

Come on.

1130
01:08:18,290 --> 01:08:19,290
Trust me.

1131
01:08:27,796 --> 01:08:30,270
- [Radio] After three innings
of play here at Tubs Field

1132
01:08:30,271 --> 01:08:31,396
there is still no score between

1133
01:08:31,397 --> 01:08:34,844
the Grizzly Bears and the Wool Socks.

1134
01:08:34,845 --> 01:08:39,012
The winner of this game takes
the coveted Beaver Pelt Crown.

1135
01:08:40,596 --> 01:08:42,282
- It's a go.

1136
01:08:42,283 --> 01:08:44,655
Tell Denver we're on.

1137
01:08:44,656 --> 01:08:45,656
Good.

1138
01:08:49,451 --> 01:08:51,586
- And they're merging with who?

1139
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:52,670
Are you sure?

1140
01:08:54,027 --> 01:08:55,027
Hang on.

1141
01:08:56,331 --> 01:08:59,778
Oh yeah count me in for 1,000 shares.

1142
01:08:59,779 --> 01:09:01,109
Great.

1143
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,781
Yeah just between you and me.

1144
01:09:02,782 --> 01:09:03,782
What's that?

1145
01:09:04,694 --> 01:09:06,246
Oh it snowed in the mountains last night.

1146
01:09:06,247 --> 01:09:08,411
Oh it's gonna be a great
winter, you should come out.

1147
01:09:08,412 --> 01:09:09,405
Yeah we'll set it up.

1148
01:09:09,405 --> 01:09:10,405
Okay see ya.

1149
01:09:12,272 --> 01:09:14,589
- Bad man, hittin' home
runs for capitalism.

1150
01:09:14,590 --> 01:09:16,162
- How's it going Al?

1151
01:09:16,163 --> 01:09:19,353
- It's going, running around,
getting ready for this roast.

1152
01:09:19,354 --> 01:09:20,798
Like I got time for this.

1153
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:21,904
You gonna be there?

1154
01:09:21,905 --> 01:09:24,155
- Oh yeah wouldn't miss it.

1155
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:29,654
- [Radio] It's deep,
it's way back, home run.

1156
01:09:29,655 --> 01:09:30,905
- Oh man, damn.

1157
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:36,499
Is uh, is Kurt in?

1158
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:38,833
- Uh no he left for the day.

1159
01:09:41,004 --> 01:09:43,513
But he did leave that for you.

1160
01:09:43,514 --> 01:09:45,937
So I hear you're making
a bid on the house.

1161
01:09:45,938 --> 01:09:46,771
- We'll see.

1162
01:09:46,771 --> 01:09:47,604
- Oh that's great.

1163
01:09:47,604 --> 01:09:48,529
- Did he say where he was going?

1164
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:49,529
- Uh uh.

1165
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:52,864
- I gotta skip.

1166
01:09:52,865 --> 01:09:54,364
- Okay, later man.

1167
01:09:58,513 --> 01:10:01,096
Hey Dad, can you keep a secret?

1168
01:10:07,864 --> 01:10:11,312
- [Radio] As you know fans,
everybody loves a winner.

1169
01:10:11,313 --> 01:10:12,980
Why should it be any different

1170
01:10:12,981 --> 01:10:15,235
when you do your weekend grocery shopping?

1171
01:10:15,236 --> 01:10:17,250
So if you wanna reach for a winner,

1172
01:10:17,251 --> 01:10:20,204
go for Werner Wiener Dogs.

1173
01:10:20,205 --> 01:10:24,095
Because if it's a Werner,
you know it's a winner.

1174
01:10:24,096 --> 01:10:28,263
♫ It's a Werner, it's a wiener,
it's a Werner Wiener Dog

1175
01:10:31,093 --> 01:10:35,260
♫ It's a Werner it's wiener,
it's a Werner Wiener Dog

1176
01:10:40,429 --> 01:10:42,596
- Alright Deano, good man.

1177
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:45,424
- [Al] Hey Mac.

1178
01:10:45,424 --> 01:10:46,364
- How're you doing?

1179
01:10:46,364 --> 01:10:47,204
Want a hand?

1180
01:10:47,205 --> 01:10:49,114
- [Al] Thanks.

1181
01:10:49,115 --> 01:10:52,920
- Let's get this puppy out
of here, get it on some ice.

1182
01:10:52,921 --> 01:10:54,557
One, two, three.

1183
01:10:54,558 --> 01:10:56,658
Ready to do the deed?

1184
01:10:56,659 --> 01:10:58,242
- [Al] Let's do it.

1185
01:11:00,123 --> 01:11:03,373
- Ah friends, Ajaxians, pig lovers all.

1186
01:11:05,977 --> 01:11:08,588
We have gathered here today
to pay homage not only

1187
01:11:08,589 --> 01:11:10,339
to a pig, but a sage.

1188
01:11:12,545 --> 01:11:15,045
Not only to a hog, but a muse.

1189
01:11:17,241 --> 01:11:20,158
Not only to a porker, but a friend.

1190
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:25,012
Not only to a pause sign, mind traveler,

1191
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:28,181
but a transcendent spirit.

1192
01:11:29,478 --> 01:11:33,027
Tonight Scrapple we will
feast on you, all the while

1193
01:11:33,028 --> 01:11:36,218
remembering what you have
brought to our lives.

1194
01:11:36,219 --> 01:11:38,802
Laughter, surprise, and family.

1195
01:11:41,987 --> 01:11:45,143
Tonight we will eat from
your ample loins to provide

1196
01:11:45,144 --> 01:11:48,268
nourishment for our hungry hearts,

1197
01:11:48,269 --> 01:11:51,519
our eager minds, and our empty bellies.

1198
01:11:54,462 --> 01:11:56,545
We pray to you Ullr.

1199
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:57,859
- [All] Ullr.

1200
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:00,963
- To provide bountiful
manner from the heavens above

1201
01:12:00,964 --> 01:12:03,815
for our coming winter season.

1202
01:12:03,816 --> 01:12:04,816
Gentlemen.

1203
01:12:10,643 --> 01:12:11,643
- You ready?

1204
01:12:13,237 --> 01:12:14,570
- Lock and load.

1205
01:12:23,989 --> 01:12:25,322
I can't do this.

1206
01:12:47,387 --> 01:12:48,428
(gun shot ringing)

1207
01:12:48,429 --> 01:12:49,588
- [Radio] There's a drive toward left.

1208
01:12:49,589 --> 01:12:51,380
It's deep, it could be.

1209
01:12:51,381 --> 01:12:54,845
Yes, he watches it go into the screen.

1210
01:12:54,846 --> 01:12:58,326
The Grizzly Bears take
the lead three to two.

1211
01:12:58,327 --> 01:13:01,040
And the team goes flying
out of the dugout.

1212
01:13:01,041 --> 01:13:04,624
Suddenly this whole
game has turned around.

1213
01:13:08,806 --> 01:13:09,755
- Remember what I said.

1214
01:13:09,756 --> 01:13:12,058
Nobody and I mean nobody
is to make any kind of move

1215
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:15,180
until we've got verification of cash.

1216
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:16,342
Cash transaction.

1217
01:13:16,343 --> 01:13:18,216
Have I made myself perfectly clear?

1218
01:13:18,217 --> 01:13:19,217
Excellent.

1219
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:22,503
Sheriff looks like we're good to go here.

1220
01:13:22,504 --> 01:13:24,807
Take my man Lewis and
get yourself a position.

1221
01:13:24,808 --> 01:13:25,808
Alright.

1222
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,939
Who the hell's got my lighter.

1223
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:35,023
(blow dryer running)

1224
01:13:57,491 --> 01:13:59,623
- How's it going Juerta?

1225
01:13:59,624 --> 01:14:01,791
(sighing)

1226
01:14:03,993 --> 01:14:05,033
How's it going Juerta?

1227
01:14:05,034 --> 01:14:06,296
How's it going Juerta?

1228
01:14:06,297 --> 01:14:07,389
How's it going Juerta?

1229
01:14:07,390 --> 01:14:08,736
Buenos dios Juerta.

1230
01:14:08,737 --> 01:14:10,239
Buenos dios Juerta.

1231
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:11,823
Buenos dios Juerta.

1232
01:14:25,917 --> 01:14:26,917
The bike!

1233
01:14:31,822 --> 01:14:33,391
Have you seen Easy?

1234
01:14:33,392 --> 01:14:36,642
(upbeat country music)

1235
01:15:11,672 --> 01:15:14,180
- It's a no go, that's right, yes.

1236
01:15:14,181 --> 01:15:16,280
Tell Juerta I'll call tomorrow okay?

1237
01:15:16,281 --> 01:15:17,281
Great.

1238
01:15:22,681 --> 01:15:24,130
- Have you see Tom?

1239
01:15:24,131 --> 01:15:25,205
- No.

1240
01:15:25,206 --> 01:15:26,539
What's going on?

1241
01:15:28,278 --> 01:15:29,278
- He's gone.

1242
01:15:30,173 --> 01:15:31,076
- He's gone?

1243
01:15:31,077 --> 01:15:32,779
- I can't find him anywhere.

1244
01:15:32,780 --> 01:15:35,036
I've been looking all over
town, his bike's gone.

1245
01:15:35,037 --> 01:15:37,204
I think he just split man.

1246
01:15:38,894 --> 01:15:40,477
- Thought he might.

1247
01:15:44,352 --> 01:15:46,019
- Listen I gotta go.

1248
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:52,458
- Al Dean, is everything okay?

1249
01:15:52,459 --> 01:15:55,292
- [Al] No, everything is not okay.

1250
01:16:09,901 --> 01:16:10,901
Kurt!

1251
01:16:13,144 --> 01:16:14,144
Kurt!

1252
01:16:17,814 --> 01:16:18,814
Kurt!

1253
01:16:25,457 --> 01:16:26,457
Kurt!

1254
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,180
Kurt!

1255
01:16:30,989 --> 01:16:33,489
(funky music)

1256
01:16:43,328 --> 01:16:44,411
- Whoa, what?

1257
01:16:48,807 --> 01:16:49,807
Klauss?

1258
01:16:51,315 --> 01:16:52,867
What the hell are you doing here.

1259
01:16:52,868 --> 01:16:54,847
Check the orders out.

1260
01:16:54,848 --> 01:16:57,831
Get up Kurt, you look like shit.

1261
01:16:57,832 --> 01:17:00,249
- I was, I was a little edgy.

1262
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:14,593
So what are you doing here?

1263
01:17:14,594 --> 01:17:17,048
- Little change of plans.

1264
01:17:17,049 --> 01:17:20,650
I decided to come check
things out first myself here.

1265
01:17:20,651 --> 01:17:21,484
- Why?

1266
01:17:21,484 --> 01:17:22,445
I got somebody going to the airstrip.

1267
01:17:22,446 --> 01:17:24,697
- There's no one going to the airstrip.

1268
01:17:24,698 --> 01:17:27,115
- What are you talking about?

1269
01:17:28,793 --> 01:17:30,670
- I'm talking about the pigs.

1270
01:17:30,671 --> 01:17:31,671
- Pigs?

1271
01:17:32,395 --> 01:17:35,790
- Yeah, the place is
swarmed with pigs, feds.

1272
01:17:35,791 --> 01:17:38,458
CDI, FBI, DEA, even the Sheriff.

1273
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:42,770
They're having a party up there.

1274
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,438
- Everything's cool.

1275
01:17:45,502 --> 01:17:47,585
- It must be my paranoia.

1276
01:17:51,356 --> 01:17:53,966
Put out your cigarette.

1277
01:17:53,967 --> 01:17:54,967
- What?

1278
01:17:55,724 --> 01:17:59,891
- Your cigarette, put it
out, it's not good for you.

1279
01:18:01,969 --> 01:18:05,406
I am sorry you're so unhappy Kurt.

1280
01:18:05,407 --> 01:18:08,407
(gun shot blasting)

1281
01:18:12,442 --> 01:18:14,984
(crowd chattering)

1282
01:18:14,985 --> 01:18:17,268
- [Radio] It's not over
and it won't be over

1283
01:18:17,269 --> 01:18:21,042
until the final round is
recorded here at Tubs Field.

1284
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:22,851
Could it get any better than this?

1285
01:18:22,852 --> 01:18:24,712
A game, a season, an entire

1286
01:18:24,713 --> 01:18:27,463
athletic heritage for two cities.

1287
01:18:34,079 --> 01:18:38,358
There's a chance to win the
game at the bottom of the ninth.

1288
01:18:38,359 --> 01:18:42,526
The wind up, the hook delivers,
Lastrisky pops it way up.

1289
01:18:43,426 --> 01:18:46,912
High nettles is under
an involved territory

1290
01:18:46,913 --> 01:18:49,214
and the Grizzly Bears win.

1291
01:18:49,215 --> 01:18:52,356
The Denver Grizzly Bears have just beaten

1292
01:18:52,357 --> 01:18:56,350
the Colorado Springs
Wool Socks five to four

1293
01:18:56,351 --> 01:18:59,132
to claim the Beaver Pelt crown.

1294
01:18:59,133 --> 01:19:02,067
For the Grizzlies the taste of victory

1295
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:06,453
has to be particularly
sweet for all the difficulty

1296
01:19:06,454 --> 01:19:09,184
this club faced on the season.

1297
01:19:09,185 --> 01:19:12,185
(upbeat rock music)

1298
01:19:20,483 --> 01:19:21,483
- Errol.

1299
01:19:27,272 --> 01:19:28,910
- How're you doing Sunshine?

1300
01:19:28,911 --> 01:19:29,815
- [Laura] What's happening Errol?

1301
01:19:29,815 --> 01:19:30,720
- Not too much.

1302
01:19:30,720 --> 01:19:31,553
I'm looking for Sully.

1303
01:19:31,553 --> 01:19:32,386
Have you seen him?

1304
01:19:32,386 --> 01:19:33,219
- No.

1305
01:19:33,219 --> 01:19:34,052
- What about Al?

1306
01:19:34,052 --> 01:19:34,885
- [Laura] Not tonight.

1307
01:19:34,886 --> 01:19:38,126
- Oh well, you snooze you lose.

1308
01:19:38,127 --> 01:19:41,127
(upbeat rock music)

1309
01:19:50,718 --> 01:19:53,301

I didn't think things were that bad.

1377

01:28:04,539 --> 01:28:07,168
♫ Your love was like the sun

1425
01:28:07,169 --> 01:28:10,322
♫ And I don't remember
no cold days darlin'

1426
01:28:10,323 --> 01:28:13,380
♫ Just the warm, warm ones

1427
01:28:13,381 --> 01:28:16,618
♫ Day by day

1428
01:28:16,619 --> 01:28:20,369
♫ Oh just one step at a time

1429
01:28:23,911 --> 01:28:27,021
♫ If we're fools in life

1430
01:28:27,022 --> 01:28:31,648
♫ Then a happy fool I would rather be

1431
01:28:31,649 --> 01:28:34,412
♫ Oh babe

1432
01:28:34,413 --> 01:28:37,713
♫ I can learn from you

1433
01:28:37,714 --> 01:28:41,876
♫ Yes and you can learn from me

1434
01:28:41,877 --> 01:28:44,820
♫ Oh babe

1435
01:28:44,821 --> 01:28:47,757
♫ You know when things get down

1436
01:28:47,758 --> 01:28:50,287
♫ And things get sad

1437
01:28:50,288 --> 01:28:52,691
♫ We can cheer up each other

1438
01:28:52,692 --> 01:28:55,898
♫ 'Cause things just ain't that bad

1439
01:28:55,899 --> 01:28:59,239
♫ If we're fools in life

1440
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:03,407
♫ But a happy fool I would rather be

1441
01:29:28,979 --> 01:29:31,149
♫ When things get down

1442
01:29:31,150 --> 01:29:33,684
♫ Things get sad

1443
01:29:33,685 --> 01:29:35,773
♫ We can cheer up each other

1444
01:29:35,774 --> 01:29:38,599
♫ 'Cause things just ain't that bad

1445
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:41,628
♫ If we're fools in life

1446
01:29:41,629 --> 01:29:46,144
♫ Yeah then a happy fool I would rather be

1447
01:29:46,145 --> 01:29:49,716
♫ Oh baby, come on

1448
01:29:49,717 --> 01:29:54,415
♫ Further on down the road baby

1449
01:29:54,416 --> 01:29:57,583
♫ You'll accompany me

1450
01:29:58,491 --> 01:30:00,218
♫ Oh that's what I'm hoping for

1451
01:30:00,219 --> 01:30:04,219
♫ Further on down the road baby

1452
01:30:05,091 --> 01:30:08,258
♫ You'll accompany me

1453
01:30:11,681 --> 01:30:13,925
♫ When I look back

1454
01:30:13,926 --> 01:30:16,826
♫ Your love was like the sun

1455
01:30:16,827 --> 01:30:19,802
♫ And I don't remember the cold days baby

1456
01:30:19,803 --> 01:30:22,183
♫ Just the warm ones

1457
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:24,601
♫ Day by day

1458
01:30:25,619 --> 01:30:29,248
♫ Oh just one step at a time

1459
01:30:29,249 --> 01:30:31,332
♫ Oh, oh

1460
01:30:59,182 --> 01:31:02,349
♫ Oh babe, oh darlin'
