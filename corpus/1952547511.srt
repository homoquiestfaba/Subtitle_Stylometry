1
00:00:57,637 --> 00:01:00,606
Rather disheartening,
isn't it, Mr. President?

2
00:01:00,674 --> 00:01:02,539
All those taxpayer dollars...

3
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:05,134
poured into hardware,
and look where it gets you.

4
00:01:05,212 --> 00:01:07,703
You might as well
have been feeding the hungry!

5
00:01:08,815 --> 00:01:12,876
Yours will be my fourth
conquered world.

6
00:01:12,953 --> 00:01:14,853
Don't count on it, Suitor.

7
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:18,220
But I already have.
Some wine?

8
00:01:19,926 --> 00:01:23,794
I do wish you'd face facts
and tell your people to surrender!

9
00:01:23,864 --> 00:01:26,298
No! I will not ask my people...

10
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:29,529
to give up everything they know
to serve a sadistic...

11
00:01:29,603 --> 00:01:32,094
egotistical, homicidal maniac!

12
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:36,403
I don't think of myself
as egotistical.

13
00:01:36,476 --> 00:01:38,034
Proud, maybe, but...

14
00:01:39,379 --> 00:01:42,314
General Suitor, General Suitor!
Intruder, level five!

15
00:01:43,316 --> 00:01:44,647
Ramsey.

16
00:01:46,386 --> 00:01:48,752
Hold on!

17
00:01:55,529 --> 00:01:57,087
Move, move!

18
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,742
Goin' up?
Let me give you a hand.

19
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:26,921
Goin' down.

20
00:02:57,157 --> 00:03:01,184
Really, Shep, from you
I had expected something much better.

21
00:03:07,934 --> 00:03:09,799
Stop!

22
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,566
He's mine.

23
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,141
It's been nice knowing you, Shep.

24
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:18,837
- There will be others.
- Goody, goody.

25
00:03:31,358 --> 00:03:33,485
Hashina, run, run!

26
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,155
Negotiations have ended!

27
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,221
Bye now.

28
00:03:54,447 --> 00:03:56,847
Intruder on level two!

29
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:27,102
Come on! Level out! Stabilize!
Stick with me! Come on!

30
00:04:29,816 --> 00:04:32,910
Come on! Come on!

31
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,816
Yes! Yeah.

32
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:42,258
That a boy, that a boy.

33
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:51,594
Excellent work, Ramsey.
The Shiute System can now live...

34
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:54,231
without threat of annihilation
by General Suitor.

35
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:56,434
Millions are in your debt.

36
00:04:56,509 --> 00:04:58,602
Great. So what's next?

37
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:03,138
Well, actually, with the evil general
out of the way, things are pretty quiet.

38
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:05,411
You gotta have
something on your books.

39
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,545
- Maybe a terrorist extermination?
- No.

40
00:05:08,622 --> 00:05:11,887
- Galactic narc duty?
- Uh-uh.

41
00:05:11,958 --> 00:05:16,019
Okay, how about a big bug hunt
with creatures that bleed acid?

42
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:17,529
Listen, Shep...

43
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:22,133
I don't know how to say this,
but lately, well...

44
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,363
you haven't been
quite the old Ramsey.

45
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:29,038
For instance, the old Ramsey would never
have let President Hashina get killed.

46
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:31,976
- Now wait a minute!
- That's all right.

47
00:05:32,045 --> 00:05:34,013
I'm not blaming you.
Not your fault.

48
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,708
Simply that you've
been working too hard.

49
00:05:36,783 --> 00:05:41,277
And anyone in your position
would be a little stressed out.

50
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,379
I'm not stressed out!

51
00:05:44,924 --> 00:05:48,291
Shep? Shep, what have you done?

52
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,488
- Nothing.
- Yes, you have.

53
00:05:50,563 --> 00:05:53,464
You have blown your power console.

54
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:57,728
Now this is what you do.
You land, lay low...

55
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:02,138
find a power source,
use your transformer and recharge...

56
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,472
no higher than.01 percent.

57
00:06:04,544 --> 00:06:07,411
Anything more than that
would be traceable.

58
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:11,348
.01 percent? It'll take me
six weeks to recharge!

59
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,545
What am I gonna do
for six weeks?

60
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:16,555
Why don't you try relaxing?

61
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:20,718
Disappear, Shep. Blend in.

62
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:22,489
Get to know the locals.

63
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:26,054
- But I just...
- Consider it an order, Ramsey!

64
00:06:30,003 --> 00:06:31,868
Six weeks.

65
00:06:31,938 --> 00:06:34,031
What am I gonna do for six weeks?

66
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:42,911
Oh, no!

67
00:06:42,982 --> 00:06:45,542
Earthlings.

68
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:48,052
I hate earthlings.

69
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:04,563
- Dad?
- Come on in, honey.

70
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:07,902
Mom says to tell you to go to work.

71
00:07:09,175 --> 00:07:10,870
Please, Dad, get a grip.

72
00:07:10,944 --> 00:07:12,775
Tell your mom I'll be right in.

73
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:14,074
Okay.

74
00:07:39,472 --> 00:07:42,839
Oh, Charlie. Good. We gotta talk.

75
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:45,776
How are we gonna pay all these bills?

76
00:07:45,845 --> 00:07:49,838
Charlie, I'm serious!
You've gotta ask for that raise.

77
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:52,714
Oh, now, honey,
it's just not that simple.

78
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:55,516
If I ask for it and I don't get it,
where does that leave us?

79
00:07:56,656 --> 00:07:59,784
If I march in there and demand it,
I might find myself without a job.

80
00:07:59,859 --> 00:08:02,327
Oh, honey, you always
play it so safe.

81
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:06,422
Once in a while, you just gotta get up
enough confidence and take a chance.

82
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:07,659
That's not fair.

83
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:10,498
I play it safe for you and the kids.

84
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,334
If it wasn't for that...

85
00:08:13,406 --> 00:08:15,499
I can be daring when I want to be.

86
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:17,869
So can I.

87
00:08:17,944 --> 00:08:20,674
Charlie, say it.

88
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:24,012
I will ask for a raise today, honey.

89
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:26,017
Thanks, honey.

90
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:32,823
I'm here to ask for a raise!

91
00:08:32,892 --> 00:08:35,190
I'm tired of busting my butt
for this company...

92
00:08:35,261 --> 00:08:38,355
only to be passed over
when promotions are being handed out!

93
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:44,697
- I deserve to be recognized.
- Sounds good to me, Wilcox.

94
00:08:44,771 --> 00:08:47,035
Now all you have to do
is have the cojones...

95
00:08:47,106 --> 00:08:49,631
to say it to your boss
instead of his secretary.

96
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:03,454
- Charlie, hey! How are you?
- I'm doing fine, sir.

97
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:06,083
- And how is that lovely wifeJulie?
- Jenny.

98
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:13,095
You're right. And two great kids.
Mark, 9. Theresa, 12.

99
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,690
Yeah, they're just...

100
00:09:16,936 --> 00:09:19,530
- Still allergic to tuna?
- Yes, I suppose I am.

101
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:21,767
I know. Come on,
who knows you better than I do?

102
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:24,207
You're thinking to yourself...

103
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:28,077
"How does he care so much?
How does he care to check?"

104
00:09:28,147 --> 00:09:30,911
I'll tell you how. People, Charlie.
People caring about people.

105
00:09:30,984 --> 00:09:33,509
People giving to other people.
That's the way I choose to live.

106
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:36,180
Not being a taker.
What are those? The blueprints?

107
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:40,853
Oh, yeah.

108
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:46,456
Oh, Charlie! Yes, yes!
These are adequate.

109
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:49,524
Adequate? I spent
the entire weekend on them.

110
00:09:49,602 --> 00:09:52,833
- Really?
- I solved all the design problems.

111
00:09:52,906 --> 00:09:55,033
- I recalculated the specs.
- Yes?

112
00:09:55,108 --> 00:09:57,099
- I reinforced the foundations.
- Yes, I see that.

113
00:09:59,045 --> 00:10:03,072
I even added a French arch.
Makes the entrance pop out dynamically.

114
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:05,140
Yes. Yes, it does.

115
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:07,243
Did I tell you I spent
the entire weekend on this?

116
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,379
Did I tell you I spent the entire
weekend with an incredible blonde?

117
00:10:09,455 --> 00:10:11,753
- What I'm trying to say...
- I know what you're trying to say.

118
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:13,758
Come on, Charlie.
You had a stinko weekend.

119
00:10:13,826 --> 00:10:15,953
That's because you're different
from those other draftsmen out there.

120
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:18,964
You know the type... sucking the money,
never giving, always taking.

121
00:10:19,032 --> 00:10:21,227
Charlie, look at me.
Be with me now.

122
00:10:21,301 --> 00:10:23,792
Come on now. Come on, boy.
You know you're different.

123
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:26,805
And lucky too. You know why?
Come on, you know why.

124
00:10:26,873 --> 00:10:29,398
Sweating the details,
making the deadlines.

125
00:10:29,475 --> 00:10:32,239
Come on. Living the dream, Charlie.
That's what counts.

126
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:35,975
Do you realize I envy you?
Here's the thing.

127
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,950
I have to give myself a little credit
for discovering your talent...

128
00:10:39,018 --> 00:10:41,851
which is why I'd like to show you
something a little special right now.

129
00:10:41,921 --> 00:10:44,754
Beautiful, aren't they? Not a single
internal blemish in any of them.

130
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,758
Do you know why?
I'll tell you why.

131
00:10:46,826 --> 00:10:50,455
Pure cymian crystal. These awards
are my proudest possessions.

132
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,931
I really believe someday between your
talent and maybe a little help from me...

133
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,525
you're gonna find your own name
on one of those.

134
00:10:56,602 --> 00:10:58,763
Believe me, that'll be worth more
than all the money in China.

135
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,033
- Tea.
- What?

136
00:11:01,107 --> 00:11:03,473
- Tea in China.
- You're a detail man, Charlie.

137
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:06,774
That's why I like you, and that's
why my door is always open to you.

138
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:09,110
Of course, I suppose that
we've both got our work to do...

139
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:11,980
so if there's nothing else
right now...

140
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,076
- No, sir.
- Splendid.

141
00:11:14,153 --> 00:11:16,451
Oh, look who's here. Welcome.

142
00:11:16,522 --> 00:11:19,548
Just trying to rival that celebrated
Japanese sense of employee relations...

143
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:22,059
you people are born with,
or so it seems.

144
00:11:26,966 --> 00:11:30,993
Mr. Zukaki says he's very impressed
with your knowledge of his culture.

145
00:11:32,805 --> 00:11:34,170
Details, gentlemen, details.

146
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,504
That's why I think you're gonna like
my redesign of your plans.

147
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,976
Worked all weekend on them.
Even added a little French arch.

148
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:41,912
Seems to make the entrance
just pop out. Don't you think?

149
00:11:43,216 --> 00:11:45,150
Strike out?

150
00:11:45,218 --> 00:11:47,550
I didn't even get up to bat.

151
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,480
Earthlings.

152
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:03,361
Now, where'd I put
that transformer?

153
00:13:29,589 --> 00:13:31,648
Come on, move it!

154
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:35,291
Let's go!

155
00:13:35,361 --> 00:13:36,919
Damn it!

156
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:59,050
What are you doing? Huh?
What are you doing here?

157
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:02,884
What are you, huh?
Are you a deliverer?

158
00:14:09,395 --> 00:14:11,329
Check him out!

159
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:17,532
- Wow!
- Did you see that guy?

160
00:14:22,141 --> 00:14:24,166
Give me back my money!

161
00:14:26,312 --> 00:14:28,974
- Excuse me.
- It took my money!

162
00:14:29,048 --> 00:14:31,642
- There.
- Oh, great! Thank you.

163
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:39,157
- Get out of the way!
- All right!

164
00:14:39,225 --> 00:14:42,683
Guess you don't shop off the rack
much, do you, huh, buddy?

165
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,542
Shut up, Ralph!

166
00:14:58,644 --> 00:15:00,373
Stupid dog.

167
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,482
Yeah, what?

168
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:22,023
Ralph! Ralph!

169
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:30,573
Help me!

170
00:16:10,349 --> 00:16:14,217
- Do you mind?
- It's your pain-in-the-butt neighbor.

171
00:16:17,923 --> 00:16:22,155
- Hey, park across the street.
- Yeah, you big jerk.

172
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,505
Wake up, jerk!

173
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:17,778
Weak strategy, Wilcox.
Should've opened the door wider.

174
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:19,511
Always deal from strength.

175
00:17:19,585 --> 00:17:21,951
They would've ripped
the door off, Colonel!

176
00:17:22,021 --> 00:17:24,990
Not likely. They wouldn't want
to bruise their little hot rod.

177
00:17:25,057 --> 00:17:28,891
Even if they did, it'd be worth it.
Let the little bastards eat some steel.

178
00:17:28,961 --> 00:17:30,622
It's what you call
acceptable loss.

179
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:33,859
Your car door is one.
Your freedom is not!

180
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,816
Hi, honey.

181
00:17:54,053 --> 00:17:59,150
Jenny? Been watching Baby Ruth
again today, dear?

182
00:17:59,225 --> 00:18:00,988
Doctor Ruth!

183
00:18:02,862 --> 00:18:06,263
I just thought you sounded
so sad on the phone...

184
00:18:06,332 --> 00:18:09,324
maybe you needed
a little compassion.

185
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,663
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I'm just not in the mood.

186
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:14,831
Oh...

187
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:18,973
don't mention it.

188
00:18:23,315 --> 00:18:25,840
- Thanks anyway.
- You're welcome.

189
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:30,480
I'm just too upset.
I mean, this was a horrible day.

190
00:18:30,556 --> 00:18:35,391
All I want to do right now
is get out to the workshop...

191
00:18:35,461 --> 00:18:37,861
pick up my hammer...

192
00:18:40,499 --> 00:18:43,024
and hit things.

193
00:18:57,016 --> 00:18:58,483
- What have you done?
- Well, l...

194
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:01,918
- What have you done!
- Now, don't fly off the handle.

195
00:19:01,987 --> 00:19:05,616
Let me explain. I've converted the shed
into a rentable apartment.

196
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:10,525
See how it solves our problems?
Now you don't have to ask for a raise.

197
00:19:10,596 --> 00:19:13,565
You can let things happen naturally,
like you like.

198
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:22,363
Now, honey,
don't take it so hard.

199
00:19:22,441 --> 00:19:24,602
Your tools are still here.

200
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,742
See?

201
00:19:44,763 --> 00:19:46,196
Now what?

202
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:51,198
Okay, okay!
All right, all right!

203
00:19:52,238 --> 00:19:53,569
What?

204
00:20:03,148 --> 00:20:05,241
I'm here to rent the apartment.

205
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:08,980
Honey, it's for you.

206
00:20:11,323 --> 00:20:12,449
Hi.

207
00:20:14,727 --> 00:20:16,820
I can't believe you
rented it out to that guy.

208
00:20:16,896 --> 00:20:19,194
He's enormous,
and he's probably dangerous.

209
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,199
- Oh, Charlie.
- I'm serious.

210
00:20:21,267 --> 00:20:24,498
If it comes right down to it, I probably
couldn't protect you against such a guy.

211
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:29,169
- What's so funny?
- Oh, well...

212
00:20:31,644 --> 00:20:33,305
These yours?

213
00:20:33,379 --> 00:20:35,404
Take your hands off my children!

214
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:40,377
- That was cool!
- Yeah. Can we do it again?

215
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,852
Okay, fine.

216
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:46,084
Everybody, dinner.

217
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:53,899
So, Mr. Ramsey, you're not
from around here, are you?

218
00:20:53,966 --> 00:20:56,491
- No.
- Oh.

219
00:20:57,736 --> 00:21:00,296
- Where are you from?
- France.

220
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,431
- How romantic!
- Ooh-la-la!

221
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:04,305
Is it okay to have more?

222
00:21:04,376 --> 00:21:07,675
Oh, sure. Help yourself.

223
00:21:07,746 --> 00:21:09,577
Oh, sorry about that.

224
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:13,799
Commander, we've got
a traceable power source.

225
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:16,966
- Can you pinpoint it?
- I'm working on it now, sir.

226
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,446
Ah, gentlemen,
you're just in time.

227
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:26,916
Here's our man. We're trying
to get a lock on him now.

228
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:49,063
We've lost it, sir.

229
00:23:49,141 --> 00:23:52,474
Well, at least we know which side
of the universe to start on. Correct?

230
00:23:52,544 --> 00:23:55,775
I'm sure you gentlemen know
what to do when you leave here.

231
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:09,155
Okay, okay. I've gotta deal with this.
I've gotta get a grip.

232
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:12,322
What the hell am I talking about,
"get a grip"?

233
00:24:12,397 --> 00:24:15,491
Darth Vader living in my back house,
for Christ's sake.

234
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:20,334
Oh, it's all right. No big deal.
I can handle it.

235
00:24:20,405 --> 00:24:22,373
Right after breakfast,
I'll go out there and tell him.

236
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:26,138
"Darth," I'll say,
"there's been a mistake.

237
00:24:26,211 --> 00:24:29,146
You have to leave... now."

238
00:24:42,161 --> 00:24:43,423
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

239
00:24:43,495 --> 00:24:45,486
- Listen, Mr. Ramsey...
- Shep.

240
00:24:46,298 --> 00:24:47,788
Okay, fine. Shep.

241
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:50,426
Listen, Shep, the thing is,
I'm gonna have to ask...

242
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:52,470
Come on, Dad!
Theresa's already in the car.

243
00:24:54,006 --> 00:24:55,940
Christ!

244
00:24:56,809 --> 00:25:00,336
I'll catch you later, Shep.

245
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:08,446
- Come on, Dad!
- I'm coming.

246
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:11,989
Bye, honey!

247
00:25:26,405 --> 00:25:27,929
Oh, Mr. Ramsey!

248
00:25:28,006 --> 00:25:31,271
No! It's Marsha!

249
00:25:31,343 --> 00:25:32,503
- Marsha?
- Yes.

250
00:25:32,578 --> 00:25:35,604
Marsha Warfield. A TV show.

251
00:25:35,681 --> 00:25:37,308
I watch her every day.

252
00:25:37,382 --> 00:25:40,681
It just so happens that today
is about screaming for health.

253
00:25:40,752 --> 00:25:43,619
You know, to get out
all those internal tensions...

254
00:25:43,689 --> 00:25:46,055
before it becomes mental stress.

255
00:25:46,124 --> 00:25:48,024
Yeah. You wanna watch?

256
00:25:54,032 --> 00:25:55,397
Stay down!

257
00:25:57,302 --> 00:25:59,896
Oh, Mr. Ramsey, no!

258
00:26:01,907 --> 00:26:04,501
No! No! It's the mailman.

259
00:26:04,576 --> 00:26:08,410
Lady, don't you think you oughta cut
his caffeine intake down a little bit?

260
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,141
Oh, sorry.

261
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:15,352
- Bull's-eye, mister!
- Wait, Mr. Ramsey!

262
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:16,887
It's the paperboy.

263
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:20,248
Okay, I'm just
gonna go inside now...

264
00:26:20,325 --> 00:26:22,316
and I'll see you later.

265
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:32,733
Bull's-eye, smart-ass!

266
00:26:37,175 --> 00:26:40,906
- Hey, let's go see the big guy!
- Yeah, good idea. Let's go.

267
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,687
Hey, Mr. Ramsey,
why don't you try?

268
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:52,883
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

269
00:27:20,786 --> 00:27:23,846
Ah, geez! Even my mom
can stay on longer than that.

270
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:42,503
Great strength.
Piss-ass balance.

271
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:49,741
- And who are you?
- The 94th Fighting Beagles' commander.

272
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:52,181
Colonel Dustin "Dusty" McHowell,
United States Army.

273
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,275
You can call me Colonel.

274
00:27:54,353 --> 00:27:56,583
- Who are you?
- Ramsey.

275
00:27:56,655 --> 00:27:58,850
Shep Ramsey, Napaun First Class...

276
00:27:58,924 --> 00:28:01,290
of the Secret Strike Force 119...

277
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,021
under the guidance
of Zanuck Vivian...

278
00:28:03,095 --> 00:28:06,064
supreme doctorate of Rool,
through Vita 9.

279
00:28:06,131 --> 00:28:08,326
Vita 9.

280
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,699
Things certainly have changed
since '44.

281
00:28:51,977 --> 00:28:55,105
So he's trapped, see?
Knows he can't win.

282
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,081
What does he do? Right then
and there, old Mad Dog surrenders.

283
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:01,347
Surrenders the whole platoon.
Wouldn't you know, Shep.

284
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,218
In one week, there was no good
of the fighting force.

285
00:29:04,289 --> 00:29:08,555
That's strategy. Sometimes
you gotta lose to win.

286
00:29:14,332 --> 00:29:18,496
- Damn it! What the hell?
- Time for the Charlie Wilcox show.

287
00:29:36,154 --> 00:29:37,746
That's not right.

288
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:09,409
Hey, Goldilocks! Do you got any idea
what these cars are worth?

289
00:30:09,488 --> 00:30:13,219
Thirty thousand bucks! Do you got
any idea what we're gonna do to you...

290
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,488
if we find one itty-bitty
scratch on them? Any idea?

291
00:30:16,561 --> 00:30:19,621
Let me guess.
You're gonna pound my face...

292
00:30:19,698 --> 00:30:21,791
break every bone in my body...

293
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:23,960
then you're gonna drag me
across a gravel road...

294
00:30:24,035 --> 00:30:25,559
and feed my remains to a warthog.

295
00:30:25,637 --> 00:30:27,002
Is that about right?

296
00:30:28,807 --> 00:30:32,504
What are you, nuts? This is the '90s.
We're gonna sue you.

297
00:30:32,577 --> 00:30:35,444
We're gonna get you
for willful destruction of property...

298
00:30:35,514 --> 00:30:37,072
- Yeah.
- Mental anguish...

299
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:39,549
- That's giving it to him!
- Loss of work hours.

300
00:30:39,618 --> 00:30:42,109
When we get through with you, you ain't
gonna have a dime left to your name.

301
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,655
You'll be hearing
from our attorney.

302
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:48,325
What kind of world is this?

303
00:30:52,898 --> 00:30:55,025
Hey, cool.
Hey, check it out.

304
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,159
Wanda lives there.

305
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:01,002
Mark, get out of the road!

306
00:31:13,818 --> 00:31:16,218
Mark, you all right?

307
00:31:40,545 --> 00:31:42,979
Whoa! Wow!

308
00:31:43,048 --> 00:31:46,814
Rad! What is that?

309
00:31:46,885 --> 00:31:48,648
- Hey!
- Shut up!

310
00:31:51,856 --> 00:31:54,552
- Cool it, man!
- You're crazy!

311
00:31:54,626 --> 00:31:55,718
Yeah!

312
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:12,900
Don't! Don't!
Shep, don't, don't! No, no, don't!

313
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:16,106
It's okay. Shep, don't.

314
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,010
Let's go back to the house.
Come on.

315
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,822
Shep, this is for you...

316
00:32:33,898 --> 00:32:35,991
in appreciation of everything
you've done for us...

317
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:39,059
and especially
for saving our son Mark.

318
00:32:39,137 --> 00:32:41,867
- Do y'all eat this stuff?
- Yeah, it's great.

319
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:44,534
It's chocolate cake. Oh.

320
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:51,007
Charlie, get a picture of this.
Hurry, quick!

321
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:52,777
Set the timer.

322
00:32:57,589 --> 00:32:59,750
- Hurry.
- Okay.

323
00:33:00,992 --> 00:33:03,961
Quick. Okay. Cheese.

324
00:33:34,025 --> 00:33:37,654
Hey! Hey, come back here,
you little weasel!

325
00:33:37,729 --> 00:33:40,960
Hey, stop him!
Somebody, help!

326
00:33:41,032 --> 00:33:45,435
Help! Is anybody there?
Somebody stole my purse!

327
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:00,945
Ma'am.

328
00:34:01,019 --> 00:34:02,953
Thank you.

329
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:24,402
Stand back.
You are too close.

330
00:34:26,411 --> 00:34:28,504
Stand back.
You are too close.

331
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,448
This is your last warning.
Back off now.

332
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:46,057
Wait, please. My mistake.
You can stand as close as you want.

333
00:34:46,131 --> 00:34:49,123
In fact, take the car.
No, please, wait, no!

334
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,226
Let's talk about this.
No, please...

335
00:34:53,805 --> 00:34:57,707
Oh, Lord, I've fallen,
and I can't get up.

336
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,527
It must be a K-7 force field.

337
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,170
Don't worry.
I'll break you out of there.

338
00:35:35,513 --> 00:35:37,378
Glad I could help.

339
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:41,545
Maybe I should stick to juggling.

340
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:27,823
Power crystals 70 percent
below operational.

341
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:31,266
Approximately 21 Earth days
to full recharge.

342
00:36:31,336 --> 00:36:33,133
You are stuck here.

343
00:37:47,245 --> 00:37:48,678
Whoa.

344
00:38:02,961 --> 00:38:06,328
No way you're winning the galaxy
this time, dragons!

345
00:38:06,397 --> 00:38:08,592
Oh, no, he's dodged my deflectors!

346
00:38:08,666 --> 00:38:11,464
- Use your phasers!
- I can't! I'm in hyperspace!

347
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,595
- Then launch photon torpedoes.
- You're crazy!

348
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:16,401
Dragons absorb photons
to get more power!

349
00:38:16,474 --> 00:38:18,772
Impossible. I thought
only Zennites could do that.

350
00:38:18,843 --> 00:38:22,040
- My shields are failing!
- Try boosting your injectors.

351
00:38:22,113 --> 00:38:25,082
They're out!
I'm doomed! It's over!

352
00:38:25,149 --> 00:38:27,174
It's never over!

353
00:38:27,251 --> 00:38:29,515
Forget it!
No one can defeat dragons!

354
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:32,579
That's what they said about
General Suitor. Give it up, dragons!

355
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:35,353
Give it up! Give it up!

356
00:38:35,426 --> 00:38:38,088
Give it up, dragons!
Give it up!

357
00:38:44,202 --> 00:38:46,033
Wow!

358
00:38:46,104 --> 00:38:50,234
You did it!
You just saved the galaxy!

359
00:38:54,212 --> 00:38:58,114
- So, you must play this game a lot.
- Game?

360
00:38:58,182 --> 00:38:59,615
What game?

361
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,901
- Hey, let me give you a hand.
- No!

362
00:39:23,975 --> 00:39:25,806
- Really, l...
- I insist.

363
00:39:27,178 --> 00:39:29,078
Glad I could help again.

364
00:39:31,282 --> 00:39:34,046
That's it.
I'm staying in nights.

365
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,284
Muscle amplifier.

366
00:40:35,279 --> 00:40:36,712
X-ray glasses.

367
00:40:36,781 --> 00:40:38,248
Wow.

368
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:49,724
Please help me!

369
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,456
- I told you she's with me, man.
- Ow, help me!

370
00:40:57,068 --> 00:40:58,831
- Come here, baby.
- Ouch!

371
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:01,667
Oh, God, help!

372
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:04,674
Let the woman go!

373
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:18,555
What in the hell
are you supposed to be?

374
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:21,649
I said, let the woman go!

375
00:41:22,593 --> 00:41:24,652
I have the strength of ten men!

376
00:41:24,729 --> 00:41:26,219
I can hurt you!

377
00:41:26,297 --> 00:41:28,197
And I bet you can stop
bullets too, huh?

378
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:31,827
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Please, please. Let's talk.

379
00:41:37,008 --> 00:41:41,911
Now I suggest that you
let the woman...

380
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:48,677
It's a giant turtle.
That's what the hell it is.

381
00:41:50,688 --> 00:41:54,021
Oh, God! Help! Ouch!

382
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:56,692
Come on, Annie!

383
00:42:12,643 --> 00:42:14,304
Oh, God!

384
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,994
Oh, thank you.
You saved my life.

385
00:42:31,062 --> 00:42:35,362
If there's anything I can do for you,
anything at all...

386
00:42:36,868 --> 00:42:42,067
Doing good... is its own reward.

387
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:50,540
Quiet!

388
00:43:53,010 --> 00:43:54,238
Hey!

389
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:07,188
What?

390
00:44:07,258 --> 00:44:10,853
My cat! My cat!

391
00:44:22,273 --> 00:44:24,969
That's not my cat!

392
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,509
Oh.

393
00:44:29,013 --> 00:44:31,743
I hate suburbia.

394
00:44:41,726 --> 00:44:44,889
Well, you know, you have to be choosy
this time of year.

395
00:44:44,962 --> 00:44:46,930
That's if you want a ripe melon.

396
00:44:46,998 --> 00:44:51,128
- Ripe ones are the best ones?
- Well, of course they are.

397
00:44:51,202 --> 00:44:54,933
There is nothing more tasty
than a ripe melon.

398
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,604
How do you know which ones
are the ripe ones?

399
00:44:58,676 --> 00:45:00,803
Well, you have to squeeze it a bit.

400
00:45:00,878 --> 00:45:03,711
And the softer the better,
I always say.

401
00:45:08,185 --> 00:45:10,346
Wow! I found a good one.

402
00:45:17,428 --> 00:45:21,364
- Hey, buddy, let me give you a hand.
- Hey, it's just a gag!

403
00:45:21,432 --> 00:45:24,697
You can have the rope.
Leave me alone!

404
00:45:24,769 --> 00:45:28,227
Get outta here!
You're crazy!

405
00:45:46,123 --> 00:45:47,147
Magnify out.

406
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:50,485
Again.

407
00:45:53,898 --> 00:45:55,490
Bounty hunters.

408
00:46:16,954 --> 00:46:19,252
- Where's Charlie Wilcox?
- In a meeting.

409
00:46:19,323 --> 00:46:21,951
Can't be disturbed.
Leave a message or take a seat.

410
00:46:24,662 --> 00:46:26,857
I said, take a seat!

411
00:46:36,607 --> 00:46:39,440
My, what a big one!

412
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:43,044
Oh, funny!
That's real funny!

413
00:46:43,114 --> 00:46:45,412
- Put that down! Shame on you!
- I am so happy.

414
00:46:45,483 --> 00:46:48,213
Please tell them how happy I am.
You can do that, can't you?

415
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:49,843
It's here!

416
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,115
Wonderful! Do you like it?
It's for our new mini mall.

417
00:46:52,189 --> 00:46:54,589
If you don't like it, we'll lose it.
All right, off you go now.

418
00:46:54,658 --> 00:46:57,183
Time to get ready for the big party.
Bye-bye. See you later.

419
00:46:58,863 --> 00:47:01,354
Save it for your lunch hour,
huh, Marge?

420
00:47:04,268 --> 00:47:06,361
All right, Charlie,
here's what I need from you now.

421
00:47:06,437 --> 00:47:09,270
I know you'll come through for me.
A set of finished blueprints...

422
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,867
the lobby, the penthouse, whatever you
think will impress ourJapanese friends.

423
00:47:12,943 --> 00:47:15,571
- And I need them tonight.
- Tonight?

424
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:18,547
Now there's an echo. Yes, tonight.
Come on. It's tough, but so are you.

425
00:47:18,616 --> 00:47:22,347
Doing a big bash for the new clients.
Your blueprints are gonna seal the deal.

426
00:47:22,419 --> 00:47:24,819
- But l...
- But-But-But... Now you're a motorbike.

427
00:47:24,889 --> 00:47:27,687
You can do it, Charlie. I know you can.
You're the one, the man, the king.

428
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:30,226
Astonish me. Oh, and by the way,
don't forget to include...

429
00:47:30,294 --> 00:47:33,593
all the little details, the make up
the bells, the trademark.

430
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,497
One more thing. Why are you still here?
You should be going, working.

431
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:39,659
Time is money. Go, go, go.

432
00:47:41,372 --> 00:47:43,932
- Where's my N-210 Aldaryzer?
- Your what?

433
00:47:44,008 --> 00:47:47,444
- Did you follow me to my ship?
- Yes.

434
00:47:47,511 --> 00:47:49,502
- Did you sneak inside?
- Well, l...

435
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:53,516
Did you fool with my stuff?
Where's my N-210 Aldaryzer?

436
00:47:53,584 --> 00:47:56,109
- All right, drop him, Kong!
- It's okay, Margie.

437
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:57,814
This is a friend of mine.

438
00:47:59,223 --> 00:48:01,248
Well, then take it outside.

439
00:48:01,325 --> 00:48:04,783
Maintenance has enough work to do
without your blood on the carpet.

440
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:08,857
- Okay, let's go.
- Where are we going?

441
00:48:08,933 --> 00:48:11,401
- To where you saved this girl.
- I can't go now. I'm working.

442
00:48:11,468 --> 00:48:13,800
I've got a deadline to meet.
What's your hurry?

443
00:48:24,682 --> 00:48:26,616
Get out of the way.

444
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:31,587
Come on, let's go.

445
00:48:38,262 --> 00:48:40,355
Ruthless interplanetary killers...

446
00:48:40,431 --> 00:48:42,695
with the deadliest high-tech
weaponry in existence...

447
00:48:42,766 --> 00:48:45,200
may be on their way here right now
because of you.

448
00:48:45,269 --> 00:48:47,794
Me? What did I do?

449
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:51,238
The weapons, the suit...
Their power sources can be traced.

450
00:48:51,308 --> 00:48:53,708
When you turned them on,
it was like sending up a flare.

451
00:48:53,777 --> 00:48:56,974
- Shep, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
- You didn't ask.

452
00:48:57,047 --> 00:49:00,414
You said "maybe,"
that they "may" find their way here.

453
00:49:00,484 --> 00:49:04,079
They may not get an exact fix.
It could pass us right by.

454
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:06,213
If no more flares are sent up.

455
00:49:06,290 --> 00:49:10,386
That's why we gotta get that
N-2 thingy back, right?

456
00:49:10,461 --> 00:49:11,894
Right.

457
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,666
This is where I was shot.
This is where I fell over.

458
00:49:27,845 --> 00:49:29,904
There's where I crash-landed.

459
00:49:32,816 --> 00:49:35,944
- And you saved this girl?
- Yes, I saved a girl.

460
00:49:37,621 --> 00:49:38,553
Wait a minute!

461
00:49:40,691 --> 00:49:44,525
We can find them with this. It zeroes in
on the gun's electronic signal.

462
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:48,395
A homing device. Great! Why didn't we
just use this in the first place?

463
00:49:48,465 --> 00:49:49,489
Shut up!

464
00:49:52,803 --> 00:49:53,929
Let's go.

465
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:56,266
Take a right, Charlie.

466
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:59,571
- Okay, now step on it.
- Shep, this is illegal!

467
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:01,634
- Watch it!
- Take another right, right here.

468
00:50:01,712 --> 00:50:03,771
Turn. Good.

469
00:50:05,716 --> 00:50:06,705
Hey, are you crazy?

470
00:50:08,385 --> 00:50:10,148
Left, left! Okay.

471
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:12,518
Take another right here, Charlie.

472
00:50:16,260 --> 00:50:18,956
- What are you slowing down for?
- Whoa!

473
00:50:20,164 --> 00:50:22,359
- We made it.
- Come on, Charlie.

474
00:50:26,136 --> 00:50:28,764
Take a left
right here in the driveway.

475
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:51,850
- Is he dead?
- Temporarily immobilized.

476
00:50:51,929 --> 00:50:54,727
He'll thaw out in about 20 minutes,
with a bad headache.

477
00:50:54,798 --> 00:50:57,733
- Let's go.
- Wow! A freeze gun.

478
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,861
Hey, just a minute!
No skimming from the top!

479
00:52:02,933 --> 00:52:05,766
Idle out, will ya? I'm the one
who found that thing, remember?

480
00:52:05,836 --> 00:52:08,134
Yeah, but I'm the one that
figured out how the thing works!

481
00:52:08,205 --> 00:52:10,639
And I'm the one that wants
the thing back now!

482
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:37,934
Shep, watch out!

483
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:42,904
Gotcha!

484
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:47,104
Antifreeze.

485
00:54:42,893 --> 00:54:45,657
- You were right about that headache.
- It'll pass.

486
00:54:45,729 --> 00:54:47,754
At least you got
your N-2 thingy back.

487
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:49,696
Now you can rest easy.

488
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:52,394
Yeah, sure.
Except for one thing.

489
00:54:52,469 --> 00:54:53,902
They're here!

490
00:54:55,038 --> 00:54:56,471
Who's here?

491
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:59,236
A couple of leeches that make their
living off the blood of others.

492
00:54:59,309 --> 00:55:02,142
- Investment bankers?
- Bounty hunters.

493
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:07,175
Bounty hunters?
You mean from up there?

494
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:09,775
Wait a minute.
Bounty hunters?

495
00:55:09,853 --> 00:55:12,651
- You said you were one of the good guys.
- I am!

496
00:55:12,723 --> 00:55:16,318
There was this evil tyrant named Suitor.
Planned to rule the universe.

497
00:55:16,393 --> 00:55:20,352
Had a lot of devoted followers. Swore
they'd follow him, even after death.

498
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,796
I gave them the chance.

499
00:55:22,866 --> 00:55:27,030
So, you're some kind
of space warrior, right?

500
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:29,265
From where?

501
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:32,137
I mean, do you belong
to some kind of an army?

502
00:55:32,209 --> 00:55:35,975
Or do you just go around doing good
like some kind of superhero?

503
00:55:36,046 --> 00:55:40,039
Hey, this isn't a cultural powwow here.
The killers are loose on your streets.

504
00:55:40,117 --> 00:55:43,883
Ten minutes listening to your ice cream
trucks, and they'll level this town.

505
00:55:44,955 --> 00:55:46,320
Can they do that?

506
00:55:49,993 --> 00:55:51,620
Yeah.

507
00:55:51,695 --> 00:55:54,755
Hey, dudes,
welcome to Surfin'Burger.

508
00:55:54,831 --> 00:55:56,856
How about the big
Big Gnarly Burger?

509
00:55:56,933 --> 00:55:58,958
We got the Wipeout Burger.
We got the Dude Burger.

510
00:55:59,036 --> 00:56:02,665
We got the Hang Ten Burger
and the Totally Awesome Burger.

511
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:08,601
Hang on, you guys!
You just got married!

512
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:10,840
Whoa! This is cool!

513
00:56:10,914 --> 00:56:13,974
You two are so cute together.
We got the special Honeymoon Burger...

514
00:56:14,051 --> 00:56:17,214
forjust newlyweds like yourselves.

515
00:56:28,198 --> 00:56:31,099
How are you gonna get
this thing out of here?

516
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:32,999
Vertical blast.

517
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:35,004
- Are you sure it'll work?
- Shut up!

518
00:56:37,407 --> 00:56:40,843
Well, then, Shep,
I guess this is good-bye.

519
00:56:42,946 --> 00:56:45,107
I don't do good-byes, Charlie.

520
00:56:47,617 --> 00:56:49,278
Oh, no! Down!

521
00:57:06,136 --> 00:57:09,037
- That's it, then.
- That's what?

522
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:10,698
We have to fight.

523
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:13,701
- We?
- We!

524
00:57:13,777 --> 00:57:17,178
I'm setting you up with a decoy.
This suit can take two direct hits.

525
00:57:17,247 --> 00:57:18,373
Two?

526
00:57:18,448 --> 00:57:20,507
You'll draw their fire
while I counterattack.

527
00:57:20,584 --> 00:57:22,313
Try this.

528
00:57:22,385 --> 00:57:25,877
I don't think so.
Look, I'm just your landlord.

529
00:57:25,956 --> 00:57:28,288
I bring you an extra bar of soap
when you need it...

530
00:57:28,358 --> 00:57:31,225
perhaps help stop
the occasional bank robbery.

531
00:57:31,294 --> 00:57:34,730
Being the target for intergalactic
bounty hunters is out of my line!

532
00:57:34,798 --> 00:57:37,323
Listen, little man,
it's your fault they're here.

533
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,300
- My fault?
- Yeah.

534
00:57:39,369 --> 00:57:42,202
You came to my house trying to
pass yourself off as an earthling!

535
00:57:42,272 --> 00:57:45,571
How the hell was I supposed to know
you were some sort of alien Rambo...

536
00:57:45,642 --> 00:57:47,872
with psycho enemies?

537
00:57:47,944 --> 00:57:51,243
What kind of a man are you anyway?
Your planet, your family.

538
00:57:51,314 --> 00:57:52,576
Exactly!

539
00:57:52,649 --> 00:57:55,550
My planet, my family were fine...

540
00:57:55,619 --> 00:57:58,213
before you brought your
intergalactic grudge match here.

541
00:57:58,288 --> 00:58:01,257
You're the one who's put them in danger!
All these guys want is you!

542
00:58:02,726 --> 00:58:04,353
Christ!

543
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:07,157
I was frozen today!

544
00:58:07,230 --> 00:58:09,221
Okay.

545
00:58:09,299 --> 00:58:11,062
You win.
It's not your fight.

546
00:58:11,134 --> 00:58:14,661
Shep, I'd help you any way I could, but
you can't expect a man with a family...

547
00:58:14,738 --> 00:58:17,366
Forget it.
It was a million-to-one shot anyway.

548
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,874
I'll fight 'em myself.

549
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:22,377
If I lose, at least
they'll leave your planet.

550
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:25,346
They'll have to take my body back
for the reward anyway.

551
00:58:25,415 --> 00:58:26,905
Does it have to be that way?

552
00:58:28,518 --> 00:58:32,079
Unless you can tell me where I can find
about 40 pounds of cymian crystal.

553
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:38,519
Beltz!

554
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,067
- Go get him.
- Yes, sir.

555
00:58:47,204 --> 00:58:49,138
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

556
00:59:02,285 --> 00:59:03,718
Hors d'oeuvres?

557
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:12,727
Well, hey, if it isn't
Fred and Barney.

558
00:59:12,796 --> 00:59:15,060
Did you two boys patch up
your little differences?

559
00:59:15,131 --> 00:59:16,496
Yes, thanks.

560
00:59:16,566 --> 00:59:19,501
I don't believe I caught
your friend's name the other day.

561
00:59:19,569 --> 00:59:21,298
- Shep.
- He's from out of town.

562
00:59:21,371 --> 00:59:23,134
Don't they have parties
where you come from?

563
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:25,697
- Not like this one.
- I know. Dull, huh?

564
00:59:25,775 --> 00:59:27,936
Football. That's my idea
of a night out.

565
00:59:28,011 --> 00:59:29,478
Football?

566
00:59:29,546 --> 00:59:31,241
Oh, yeah.

567
00:59:31,314 --> 00:59:34,943
What could be better than a bunch
of beefy, burly boys...

568
00:59:35,018 --> 00:59:37,953
beating the crap out of each other,
trying to score?

569
00:59:38,021 --> 00:59:40,512
Being a burly boy.

570
00:59:40,590 --> 00:59:43,457
- Where did you say you were from?
- Listen, Margie.

571
00:59:43,526 --> 00:59:46,188
I promised Shep
I'd show him my office.

572
00:59:47,297 --> 00:59:48,764
Your office?

573
00:59:48,832 --> 00:59:51,266
- What'd you do that for?
- The crystals. The universe.

574
00:59:51,334 --> 00:59:52,767
Remember?

575
00:59:56,606 --> 01:00:00,440
You know, I spend more time saving
worlds than I do living in them.

576
01:00:00,510 --> 01:00:02,978
Sometimes I wonder why.

577
01:00:03,046 --> 01:00:05,207
You've got everything, Charlie.

578
01:00:07,918 --> 01:00:10,978
So I said to the president,
"Hey, look...

579
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:13,454
I just build the S&Ls,
I don't run 'em."

580
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:16,118
Tell him.

581
01:00:16,192 --> 01:00:18,251
How's the champagne?
A little more champagne?

582
01:00:18,328 --> 01:00:21,320
How 'bout a round of kamikazes?

583
01:00:21,398 --> 01:00:24,094
Just special for tonight.
Tell him. Tell him that.

584
01:00:26,636 --> 01:00:27,796
Damn.

585
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:30,601
There should be a key
around here somewhere.

586
01:00:32,409 --> 01:00:34,172
Of course.

587
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:36,906
Here we go.
Fifty pounds of cymian crystal.

588
01:00:39,182 --> 01:00:42,174
Thanks. You've been a great help.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

589
01:00:42,252 --> 01:00:45,119
- Wait! They must be in the building.
- Where?

590
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,351
You know this device
could be traced?

591
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:54,363
- A calculated risk.
- Yeah.

592
01:01:27,063 --> 01:01:29,088
Got 'em. They're upstairs
in the new wing.

593
01:01:29,165 --> 01:01:30,757
Let's go.

594
01:01:46,383 --> 01:01:48,476
By the way,
do you like it in here?

595
01:01:48,551 --> 01:01:50,348
It's finished.

596
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,355
I'm kidding. This is the way
his building's gonna look.

597
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:55,958
These are all jokes.

598
01:01:56,026 --> 01:01:58,187
Anyway, take a look, seriously.
Over here, fellas.

599
01:01:58,261 --> 01:02:01,697
See that space? That's how confident
I am about this project.

600
01:02:01,765 --> 01:02:03,858
I'm unveiling it at the signing.

601
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,773
Get 'em out of here.

602
01:02:13,276 --> 01:02:17,110
Mr. Zukaki is very impressed
by your... style.

603
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,580
Right back at him. You too.
Wilcox!

604
01:02:19,649 --> 01:02:21,981
Wonderful.
Just the man I wanted to see.

605
01:02:22,052 --> 01:02:24,987
He's the best, and with a little help
and guidance, one of the very best.

606
01:02:25,055 --> 01:02:27,216
Did you make the alterations
I specified?

607
01:02:27,290 --> 01:02:30,487
Yes, yes, yes.
I left them down in the car.

608
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:33,051
- Why the car?
- I'll go bring them to your office.

609
01:02:33,129 --> 01:02:35,563
Good. Splendid. One more thing.
Will I be astonished?

610
01:02:35,632 --> 01:02:38,533
- I think so.
- I almost kissed you, but I wouldn't.

611
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:40,034
Good. Go.

612
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:42,333
Ready, everyone?
Off to the party. Here we go.

613
01:02:42,405 --> 01:02:45,272
One, two, one, two. That's good.
Size order. It's important.

614
01:03:04,594 --> 01:03:06,858
Hold it right there!

615
01:03:06,930 --> 01:03:09,023
Boys, boys, boys.

616
01:03:09,099 --> 01:03:12,091
Now, why don't you
put that back where it belongs?

617
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:14,136
Bounty hunters!
Let's get out of here!

618
01:03:32,789 --> 01:03:35,155
Tag. You're it.

619
01:04:55,738 --> 01:05:00,072
You know, for a big guy,
you're kind of light on your feet.

620
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:08,748
Have a nice flight,
camel breath.

621
01:05:19,495 --> 01:05:21,053
Talk about cheap construction.

622
01:06:09,412 --> 01:06:11,346
What is that?

623
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:22,991
Get your foot out of my face!

624
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:52,344
What is this, a tag team?

625
01:06:53,656 --> 01:06:55,590
You're a dead man, Ramsey.

626
01:06:57,593 --> 01:06:59,527
No wonder you guys never talk.

627
01:07:35,365 --> 01:07:37,526
Game over. You lose.

628
01:07:52,715 --> 01:07:55,047
Have you been to the Tar Pits?
Really a must-see.

629
01:07:55,118 --> 01:07:57,951
They're right out there.

630
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:01,387
Mr. Zukaki requests that you
explain the plans to him now.

631
01:08:01,457 --> 01:08:04,620
Wonderful. Who, me?
All right, sir.

632
01:08:04,694 --> 01:08:06,787
Gets a little technical.
I hope you follow here.

633
01:08:06,863 --> 01:08:09,058
We feel... and I'll go the distance
with you on this one.

634
01:08:09,132 --> 01:08:12,124
We feel very strongly that
the building should have floors...

635
01:08:12,201 --> 01:08:14,396
and that's, of course,
one per level.

636
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,667
It goes without saying that one man's
floor is another man's ceiling.

637
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:21,267
That's why, in order to keep them
separate, we're recommending walls.

638
01:08:24,547 --> 01:08:27,414
Why don't you just let me
take you to a doctor?

639
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:31,146
You don't have to leave right away.
You just waxed the enemy.

640
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,415
- Why don't you...
- No, it's all right.

641
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:37,152
You said you spend all your time saving
worlds without ever living in them.

642
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:39,160
This is your chance
to live in one.

643
01:08:39,228 --> 01:08:41,560
You said I put your planet
and family in danger...

644
01:08:41,631 --> 01:08:43,929
with this interplanetary
grudge match.

645
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,730
You were right.
I'm leaving before others come.

646
01:08:46,803 --> 01:08:48,737
Yes, but, Shep...

647
01:08:54,076 --> 01:08:56,476
Charlie, do me a favor.

648
01:08:56,546 --> 01:08:59,413
Go back to my place
and make sure I've got everything.

649
01:08:59,482 --> 01:09:03,384
I don't want to risk leaving even one
of those traceable devices behind.

650
01:09:03,453 --> 01:09:05,387
Okay.

651
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:09,455
And, Charlie...

652
01:09:10,526 --> 01:09:12,255
thanks.

653
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:37,878
Jenny?

654
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,362
- Oh, Charlie!
- Daddy!

655
01:10:57,433 --> 01:10:59,367
What's the matter...

656
01:11:01,370 --> 01:11:04,066
Who are you?
What do you want?

657
01:11:04,140 --> 01:11:07,200
General Suitor, at your service.

658
01:11:07,276 --> 01:11:09,676
Suitor?
You're supposed to be dead.

659
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:12,509
I'm so sorry to disappoint.

660
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:16,211
And you, I take it,
are the partner.

661
01:11:16,285 --> 01:11:20,085
Partner? Charlie,
what's he talking about?

662
01:11:20,156 --> 01:11:24,559
I was trying to help Shep escape
some intergalactic bounty hunters.

663
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:26,857
See, Shep's an alien warrior...

664
01:11:26,929 --> 01:11:30,023
who foiled this man's attempt
at ruling the universe.

665
01:11:30,099 --> 01:11:31,862
Charlie, this is serious!

666
01:11:31,934 --> 01:11:35,870
Yes, Charlie, this is...

667
01:11:35,938 --> 01:11:37,371
serious.

668
01:11:51,287 --> 01:11:52,584
Perfect timing.

669
01:11:55,124 --> 01:11:58,616
- I'm sorry, Shep. I had no choice.
- I said I don't do good-byes.

670
01:11:58,694 --> 01:12:01,254
- But I insisted.
- Suitor!

671
01:12:02,331 --> 01:12:04,731
Did you think I was so stupid...

672
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,735
not to have planned
for every contingency?

673
01:12:07,803 --> 01:12:10,897
There were many gunnery bubbles
on that ship, you know.

674
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:14,733
Help! Help!

675
01:12:21,283 --> 01:12:23,808
Get over there. Get over there!

676
01:12:23,886 --> 01:12:25,717
Move!

677
01:12:25,788 --> 01:12:26,948
Move!

678
01:12:27,023 --> 01:12:31,960
This endless cat-and-mouse
grows tiresome, Ramsey.

679
01:12:32,028 --> 01:12:34,155
I suggest you come out here now...

680
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:36,960
unless you want
this happy little group...

681
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:39,297
melted to the ground!

682
01:12:39,368 --> 01:12:41,768
If it'd end your career,
it'd be worth it.

683
01:12:41,837 --> 01:12:46,240
Bad bluff, Ramsey.
You see, I know something.

684
01:12:46,308 --> 01:12:48,833
You actually care...

685
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,879
for these creatures.

686
01:12:50,946 --> 01:12:53,813
You're wrong.
They mean nothing to me.

687
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:55,316
Mom, help!

688
01:12:57,386 --> 01:12:59,946
Please, let her go!

689
01:13:00,022 --> 01:13:03,116
You've got ten seconds to come out
with your hands up, Ramsey...

690
01:13:03,192 --> 01:13:06,855
before you see the inside
of this beautiful child's head.

691
01:13:08,497 --> 01:13:10,089
Ten seconds!

692
01:13:15,304 --> 01:13:17,534
Sometimes
you gotta lose to win.

693
01:13:23,179 --> 01:13:26,808
Warning. Self-destruct mechanism
has been activated.

694
01:13:31,754 --> 01:13:34,552
- That wasn't the deal.
- Here's the deal.

695
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:38,354
First you let them go.
Then do whatever you want with me.

696
01:13:38,427 --> 01:13:40,793
I won't even put up a fight.

697
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:44,993
You think I'm a fool?
Why should I believe you?

698
01:13:45,067 --> 01:13:48,730
Because I, unlike you,
am as good as my word.

699
01:13:48,804 --> 01:13:50,066
How quaint.

700
01:13:50,973 --> 01:13:55,239
Well, I'll let them go. I didn't
come here to swat at flies.

701
01:13:55,978 --> 01:13:58,674
Get them out of here, Charlie, now!

702
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:00,181
Hurry.

703
01:14:09,425 --> 01:14:12,724
This is pleasant!

704
01:14:12,795 --> 01:14:16,697
I've dreamed about this moment
ever since you blew up my ship.

705
01:14:16,766 --> 01:14:19,394
I didn't like that.

706
01:14:19,468 --> 01:14:21,663
How fitting then...

707
01:14:21,737 --> 01:14:25,195
that your death
will be the catalyst...

708
01:14:25,274 --> 01:14:27,868
that starts my rebuilding...

709
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:30,343
to ultimate power!

710
01:14:30,412 --> 01:14:34,439
So this is how you're gonna do me in...
by boring me to death with speeches.

711
01:14:34,517 --> 01:14:37,213
Oh, unfortunately for you...

712
01:14:37,286 --> 01:14:39,220
you're going to die...

713
01:14:39,288 --> 01:14:41,848
much... more...

714
01:14:41,924 --> 01:14:43,448
painfully.

715
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:53,560
I'm going back to help.

716
01:14:53,636 --> 01:14:55,570
I can't let you do that.

717
01:14:55,638 --> 01:14:58,232
Shep could've taken that guy out
back there, but he didn't... for us.

718
01:14:58,307 --> 01:15:01,640
- We can't just leave him there to die.
- You might get yourself killed.

719
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:05,271
Listen, this is something
I have got to do.

720
01:15:09,718 --> 01:15:11,379
Be careful.

721
01:15:13,455 --> 01:15:15,548
We need you.

722
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:22,663
This is much more fun...

723
01:15:22,731 --> 01:15:25,131
than I had imagined.

724
01:15:26,402 --> 01:15:28,802
So few things in life...

725
01:15:28,871 --> 01:15:32,466
live up to expectations...

726
01:15:32,541 --> 01:15:34,509
don't you find?

727
01:15:34,577 --> 01:15:37,910
I wonder how killing you...

728
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:40,005
is going to feel.

729
01:15:55,865 --> 01:15:57,298
Shep!

730
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:01,931
Forget it!

731
01:16:02,004 --> 01:16:04,598
He is finished.

732
01:16:04,673 --> 01:16:06,163
But you...

733
01:16:06,242 --> 01:16:09,507
you are just starting.

734
01:16:09,578 --> 01:16:11,808
You son of a bitch!

735
01:16:11,881 --> 01:16:13,872
You stupid little man!

736
01:16:13,949 --> 01:16:16,076
What do you hope to do to me?

737
01:16:16,151 --> 01:16:18,119
To me...

738
01:16:18,187 --> 01:16:20,519
the almighty Suitor?

739
01:16:20,589 --> 01:16:23,649
Why, I could crush your neck...

740
01:16:23,726 --> 01:16:24,715
Charlie, no!

741
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:26,988
With my bare hands...

742
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:53,244
Charlie, get out of here now!

743
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:36,981
Oh, my God! Charlie!

744
01:18:40,396 --> 01:18:41,829
Look!

745
01:18:52,808 --> 01:18:55,072
What happened?
Is the world saved?

746
01:18:55,144 --> 01:18:57,840
Oh, Charlie,
you are all right.

747
01:18:57,913 --> 01:19:00,814
He took on Suitor all by himself...

748
01:19:00,883 --> 01:19:02,908
with his bare hands.

749
01:19:02,985 --> 01:19:05,647
He's some kind of guy.

750
01:19:05,721 --> 01:19:09,088
Oh, Charlie, you are the finest man
I have ever known.

751
01:19:09,158 --> 01:19:12,025
But if you ever do anything
like this again...

752
01:19:12,094 --> 01:19:13,584
I'll kill you!

753
01:19:13,662 --> 01:19:15,687
- Way to go, Dad.
- You're the greatest.

754
01:19:17,366 --> 01:19:19,300
Give up?

755
01:19:19,368 --> 01:19:21,461
It was Raymond Burr in Godzilla.

756
01:19:21,537 --> 01:19:23,630
Nick Adams was in Rodan.

757
01:19:23,705 --> 01:19:25,969
Mothra, another classic,
by the way...

758
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:27,702
Wilcox!

759
01:19:29,211 --> 01:19:31,645
This better be good.
Make it good, make it fast.

760
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:34,705
We've been up all night. Zukaki's
about to take his business elsewhere.

761
01:19:34,783 --> 01:19:37,377
I'm running out ofJapanese movies,
so just explain your incompetence!

762
01:19:37,453 --> 01:19:40,445
My incompetence?
Is that what you've been telling them?

763
01:19:40,522 --> 01:19:44,549
I told them what's good for the company.
Be a man and accept the responsibility.

764
01:19:44,626 --> 01:19:49,063
I'm the one who's been saving your butt
for the last three years!

765
01:19:50,032 --> 01:19:53,490
You want somebody to talk to
Mr. Zukaki about incompetence...

766
01:19:54,636 --> 01:19:56,228
do it yourself!

767
01:19:56,305 --> 01:19:59,832
You're the expert.
I quit!

768
01:19:59,908 --> 01:20:01,876
Wilcox!

769
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:03,639
Charlie!

770
01:20:03,712 --> 01:20:04,804
Chuck?

771
01:20:09,218 --> 01:20:11,550
Coffee?

772
01:20:20,195 --> 01:20:22,686
Hey, dude, how 'bout a Bomb Pop?

773
01:20:27,870 --> 01:20:31,203
- Hey, you leaving?
- Leaving?

774
01:20:31,273 --> 01:20:34,265
- Bad guys beat?
- The galaxy's saved.

775
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:36,334
No loose ends, then.

776
01:20:36,411 --> 01:20:38,538
Hey, look! It's the giant!

777
01:20:41,950 --> 01:20:44,510
Well, maybe one loose end.

778
01:20:48,891 --> 01:20:51,951
Hey, man, I just got that!
Use his!

779
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,533
- Radical!
- Pure luck!

780
01:20:59,601 --> 01:21:01,899
- Was not!
- Was!

781
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:04,962
So what?
My mom did that last week.

782
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:07,065
He's going for
a full-on handstand!

783
01:21:07,142 --> 01:21:09,406
- No way!
- Way.

784
01:21:16,518 --> 01:21:19,510
Tell your mom to keep practicing.

785
01:21:19,588 --> 01:21:20,748
Aw, man!

786
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:24,081
My last board.

787
01:21:24,159 --> 01:21:25,592
Take mine.

788
01:21:26,695 --> 01:21:29,391
Cowabunga, dude!
Are you sure?

789
01:21:29,464 --> 01:21:31,830
- You want me to change my mind?
- Heck, no!

790
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:34,300
- Well, get out of here.
- Can I ride it?

791
01:21:34,369 --> 01:21:37,463
No, he gave it to me!
I have to save the galaxy!

792
01:21:46,448 --> 01:21:48,313
Again?

793
01:21:48,383 --> 01:21:50,317
My cat.

794
01:21:50,385 --> 01:21:52,478
Are you sure?

795
01:21:52,554 --> 01:21:53,987
Positive?

796
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:02,520
Bad kitty!

797
01:22:10,205 --> 01:22:12,400
Thanks.

798
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:14,408
Get a goldfish.

799
01:22:29,324 --> 01:22:31,724
- So what are you going to do now?
- Something will turn up.

800
01:22:31,793 --> 01:22:34,887
Life's too short
not to take a chance.

801
01:22:34,963 --> 01:22:37,158
Maybe I'll become
an intergalactic warrior.

802
01:22:38,100 --> 01:22:40,967
Yeah, and maybe I'll
become a family man.

803
01:22:41,036 --> 01:22:43,402
All right, E.T.,
ready for blast off.

804
01:22:44,740 --> 01:22:46,503
Purely educational.

805
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:54,041
Well, I'd better get going.

806
01:22:54,116 --> 01:22:57,017
You never know who's out there trying
to retrieve this hunk of hardware.

807
01:22:57,085 --> 01:22:58,518
Right.

808
01:22:59,988 --> 01:23:01,819
So...

809
01:23:03,392 --> 01:23:06,828
Well, have a nice flight.

810
01:23:10,098 --> 01:23:13,659
Hey, Charlie.
Too good to say good-bye?

811
01:23:24,279 --> 01:23:25,871
Good-bye, Shep.

812
01:23:25,947 --> 01:23:27,380
Good-bye, Charlie.

813
01:23:33,655 --> 01:23:37,421
- See you around.
- See you around, Charlie.

814
01:23:46,101 --> 01:23:48,092
- Good-bye, Mr. Ramsey!
- Bye, Shep!
