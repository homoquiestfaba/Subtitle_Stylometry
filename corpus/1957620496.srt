00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,333
WOMAN ON PA: Call on line one
for Mr. Kincaid.

2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,074
Oh, he's busy.

3
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,078
Don't worry, it's okay.
He won't mind.

4
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:21,429
You know you two would get
 along so much better if you
spent more time together.

5
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:23,866
Carla, I'm a history teacher.

6
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,216
I make a teacher's salary.

7
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:29,437
To your father I'm low income
 housing and you're the mansion
 on the hill.

8
00:01:29,611 --> 00:01:31,308
That's not gonna change.

9
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:33,832
But you tell me all the time
how frustrated you are
at school.

10
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,574
Yeah, but then I have one of
those days when

11
00:01:36,748 --> 00:01:39,969
the kids and I are talking
 about the same thing and
 we're on the same wavelength.

12
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,406
It's worth the frustration.

13
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:44,756
Okay.

14
00:01:45,583 --> 00:01:46,541
I'll be right back.

15
00:01:50,327 --> 00:01:52,416
Stan.

16
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,507
Stan, you're not listening to
 me. I don't care about his
 sales record!

17
00:01:56,681 --> 00:01:59,510
The guy started out with me.

18
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:02,339
He's been here since the
beginning and as far as
I'm concerned

19
00:02:02,513 --> 00:02:04,124
he's gonna be here at the end.
 [KNOCKING]

20
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:05,212
Dad?

21
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,344
Hi sweetheart, come on in.

22
00:02:07,518 --> 00:02:09,825
-I, I can come back.
 -I'll just be a second, okay?
 Just hold on.

23
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:11,609
Stan, listen.

24
00:02:11,783 --> 00:02:13,133
Why don't you work with him
 and then I'll speak with him.

25
00:02:13,307 --> 00:02:15,352
And I'm sure everything will
work out fine.

26
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,225
And, Stan,

27
00:02:18,399 --> 00:02:20,227
I really appreciate your
effort in this.

28
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:22,968
Goodbye!

29
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,625
What do ya think? Huh?

30
00:02:27,799 --> 00:02:29,671
It's an anniversary gift
 from my office staff.

31
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,239
It's beautiful.

32
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:34,632
I thought you weren't coming
in here today.

33
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,286
I'm not. Charlie and I were
 out shopping and I thought
 I would come by and visit.

34
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,461
Where is he?

35
00:02:37,635 --> 00:02:38,941
He's downstairs.

36
00:02:39,115 --> 00:02:40,334
Well why didn't you
 bring him up?

37
00:02:40,508 --> 00:02:41,422
I didn't think you
 had the time.

38
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:45,817
I always have time
 for you guys.

39
00:02:47,297 --> 00:02:49,169
Go on down and get him and
 bring him up here.

40
00:03:13,715 --> 00:03:14,933
Hi!

41
00:03:15,107 --> 00:03:16,196
Hi.

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,198
How was school?

43
00:03:19,024 --> 00:03:20,548
Boring.

44
00:03:20,722 --> 00:03:23,203
Did you get a grade back yet
on that geometry test?

45
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:25,205
C.

46
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:28,469
Well at least you passed.

47
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:32,124
Mom, I get better grades than
 any of my friends.

48
00:03:32,299 --> 00:03:34,126
Does that mean you're happy
 with a C?

49
00:03:36,128 --> 00:03:37,086
Well, no.

50
00:03:37,608 --> 00:03:38,566
Thank you.

51
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:41,960
What's that?

52
00:03:42,134 --> 00:03:44,136
A list of supplies for
 the cabin.

53
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:45,225
Anything you wanna add?

54
00:03:46,138 --> 00:03:48,053
Do I have to go?

55
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,056
We've been through this,
 it's our anniversary.

56
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,755
It's a family tradition.
It's settled.

57
00:03:55,844 --> 00:03:57,802
I have homework.

58
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:05,114
You should ask Dad for help
 with the geometry.

59
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:06,855
It's his strong suit.

60
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:08,465
Like he'd find the time.

61
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:13,122
I went by your school today,
spoke with coach Hanna.

62
00:04:13,905 --> 00:04:15,255
Yeah, about what?

63
00:04:15,429 --> 00:04:16,604
The team's prospects.

64
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:19,041
Your progress.

65
00:04:19,215 --> 00:04:23,001
You mean making sure
 I'm not living up to
 your expectations.

66
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:25,526
Well you have the talent
 to be a starter,

67
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,180
I don't understand why
 you want to sit on the bench.

68
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:32,489
You know, Dad, it's just
 possible I won't turn out
 to be the big star you were.

69
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:33,621
And I can live with that.

70
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:36,276
How was work?

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,278
Oh we're in a bit of a slump
right now.

72
00:04:39,409 --> 00:04:41,455
But I started a sales contest.

73
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:43,544
If that doesn't work out I'll
 crack the whip.

74
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,332
You got something to say, Sis.

75
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:51,900
No, Dad, this is
so interesting.

76
00:04:54,163 --> 00:04:56,992
Well it oughta be,
 because it's what puts
 food on this table.

77
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,212
Well then we better start
 cracking the whip right now.

78
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,607
Susan!

79
00:05:03,781 --> 00:05:07,307
I need to know if you plan on
 working at the job site over
 the holidays,

80
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,830
the guys are holding a spot
 for you.

81
00:05:11,093 --> 00:05:12,050
I took another job.

82
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:15,010
-You never said anything.
 -TOM: Where?

83
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:17,360
Harris' market.

84
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:18,709
And what are they gonna
 pay you?

85
00:05:19,493 --> 00:05:20,450
Six fifty an hour.

86
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,975
I pay ya nine fifty!

87
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,371
Fine.

88
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:32,201
It's a retail kind of thing.
It'll serve you well in the
real world.

89
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,464
They want me full time until
 school starts back up again.

90
00:05:36,248 --> 00:05:37,815
What about our
 anniversary trip?

91
00:05:37,989 --> 00:05:39,469
Well, I'd rather work.

92
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:41,253
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:41,428 --> 00:05:43,560
You have
 commitments to this family...

94
00:05:44,822 --> 00:05:47,042
It's once a year!

95
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,957
It wasn't last year.

96
00:05:49,131 --> 00:05:50,611
Well we started up
 a new project, I couldn't
 get away.

97
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,482
So, this year
 I can't get away.

98
00:05:52,656 --> 00:05:53,396
Oh, fine!

99
00:05:55,616 --> 00:05:57,487
I got phone calls to make.

100
00:05:57,661 --> 00:05:59,533
You two do whatever you
 wanna do.

101
00:05:59,707 --> 00:06:02,884
Your mother, I, and Carla are
 going.

102
00:06:07,976 --> 00:06:09,760
We're all going.

103
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:28,388
I wish you'd let the
 accountants do that, we pay
 them enough.

104
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,519
Mhm.

105
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:35,264
Hey I'm sorry I jumped up
 from the table.

106
00:06:35,438 --> 00:06:37,875
Sometimes I'm just like an
 eighth grader.

107
00:06:40,051 --> 00:06:41,749
I owe the kids an apology.

108
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:51,585
Carla brought Charlie by the
office today.

109
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,675
You know the more time
 I spend with him the more I
 like him.

110
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:56,241
She's lucky.

111
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,983
Ha!
 He's a hell of a lot luckier.

112
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:02,334
Would you like him better

113
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:07,557
if he was falling all over
 himself to impress you with
his executive potential?

114
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:10,386
Well at least I would
know he was ambitious.

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,433
The world needs dedicated
 teachers.

116
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:16,000
What about real estate
 salesmen?

117
00:07:16,174 --> 00:07:18,089
I married a
 real estate salesmen.

118
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:19,613
And a damn good one too.

119
00:07:19,787 --> 00:07:22,833
Oh good, bad, didn't matter.
I married him.

120
00:07:26,054 --> 00:07:29,057
What?

121
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:33,583
Maybe we shouldn't force them
 to go. They're old enough to
 make their own decisions.

122
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:34,671
No they're not!

123
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:39,937
We spend little enough time
 as a family.

124
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,200
We need this.

125
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:45,203
We should have gone last year
 no matter what.

126
00:07:45,377 --> 00:07:47,423
We're not going to make that
mistake again.

127
00:07:47,597 --> 00:07:49,469
-All we do is fight.
 -Then we'll fight.

128
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,471
We'll fight as a family.

129
00:07:57,694 --> 00:08:00,044
Why do you suppose I can't
 talk to them anymore?

130
00:08:02,003 --> 00:08:02,960
Out of practice?

131
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,705
They must know that
 I love them.

132
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:11,708
Loving them is the easy part.

133
00:08:13,144 --> 00:08:14,102
Accepting them...

134
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:16,191
that's hard.

135
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:32,686
-Mom!
-Hi sweetheart!

136
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:35,471
-Hey, Mrs. Kincaid.
 -Hello, Charlie.

137
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:37,473
-How are ya?
-Excited!
-Yeah.

138
00:08:38,692 --> 00:08:40,345
CHARLIE: Is that it?

139
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,391
ANNE: First time on a
 small plane?

140
00:08:43,784 --> 00:08:46,090
-Uh-huh.
 -CARLA: Where's Dad?

141
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:49,224
He's getting the weather.
 Did you see Susan inside?

142
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:52,053
-Didn't she come with you?
 -No, she slept over at
 Ellen's last night.

143
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:53,750
She was getting a ride.

144
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,449
-Why don't you see
if you can help Dad.
-Okay.

145
00:08:58,842 --> 00:09:00,888
Here he comes.

146
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:02,367
You should be all right,
 that system isn't due in until
 after midnight.

147
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,456
The sooner we get out of here
 the better.

148
00:09:04,631 --> 00:09:05,501
Thanks, Dave.

149
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:08,548
Hey! Everybody here?

150
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:11,463
No honey, Susan's not
 here yet.

151
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,248
Where is she?

152
00:09:32,006 --> 00:09:33,573
Okay, thank you very much.

153
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:37,359
She didn't go by the house.

154
00:09:37,533 --> 00:09:39,796
Ellen's mother said she left
 for here over an hour ago.

155
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:42,146
We're all loaded up.

156
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,670
Where is she?

157
00:09:43,844 --> 00:09:45,715
We tried the house
 and Ellen's.

158
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,716
She's supposed to be here now.

159
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,370
I'm worried.

160
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:50,590
Hello.

161
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,551
Where are the contracts now?

162
00:09:55,725 --> 00:09:57,771
Do you have any idea where
 they may have gone?

163
00:09:57,945 --> 00:10:00,469
Well Ellen has a boyfriend,
 maybe they picked him up?

164
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,471
Oh, they would have been
here by now.

165
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:17,965
They had snow at the landing
strip this morning.
It's clear now

166
00:10:18,139 --> 00:10:21,490
but if we don't get airborne
soon we're going to
lose our window.

167
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:23,535
We could leave tomorrow?

168
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,363
Bad weather could last
 for days.

169
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:28,628
Look, I can't concentrate on
the trip right now.

170
00:10:28,802 --> 00:10:30,630
I think we should call
highway patrol.

171
00:10:30,804 --> 00:10:31,631
[PHONE RINGING]

172
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:36,984
-Hello.
-Dad, it's Susan
- Where are you?

173
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,247
I'm on the road, we got stuck.

174
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:40,727
Are you all right?

175

00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:07,834
And that's it?

525
00:37:10,663 --> 00:37:13,405
Hell, it's rough country,
 Miss. Kincaid.

526
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,538
You could lose a plane, the
 size of yours in a fold of
 land so small,

527
00:37:16,712 --> 00:37:18,497
it will never show up here.

528
00:37:18,671 --> 00:37:20,673
The mistake that we can't
 afford to make,

529
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:22,979
is to be less than thorough.

530
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:28,637
Look, I don't even understand
 why you're even looking here.

531
00:37:28,811 --> 00:37:32,293
Based on the flight plan. With
 correction for the storm, and
 wind velocity,

532
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:34,687
and the last radar contact.
 We had to start somewhere.

533
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:38,125
And you should know there's
another weather front,

534
00:37:38,299 --> 00:37:40,258
scheduled to come through
there, this afternoon.

535
00:37:42,695 --> 00:37:44,349
What does that mean?

536
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:46,786
We don't put people in the air
 with zero visibility below.

537
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,917
No point.

538
00:37:49,484 --> 00:37:50,442
So, you just stop?

539
00:37:54,446 --> 00:37:56,186
We follow safety guidelines.

540
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:02,932
You think they're dead, don't
 you?

541
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:05,021
Look, I can't afford to think
 that way.

542
00:38:06,675 --> 00:38:07,633
And neither should you.

543
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,468
And you decided, it wasn't
 worth mentioning last night?

544
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:17,817
There wasn't anything we could
 do!

545
00:38:17,991 --> 00:38:19,122
According to you!

546
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,560
Maybe the dial got jarred in
the crash.

547
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:23,257
Maybe the signal was sent!

548
00:38:23,431 --> 00:38:25,041
Can't we just send the signal
 now?

549
00:38:25,215 --> 00:38:26,173
It doesn't work from the
ground.

550

I told you to turn the switch
 all the way!

555
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,096
How am I supposed to know
 that there's more than two
 positions?

556
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:37,663
Common sense, would tell you
that!

557
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:39,447
It was an accident, daddy.

558
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:40,753
Yeah, we're stuck out here in
 the middle of nowhere,

559
00:38:40,927 --> 00:38:42,058

 him!

up front, this wouldn't have
happened.

Oh, so now it's my fault!

565
00:38:50,893 --> 00:38:51,807
We shouldn't have been out in
 that storm, in the first
 place!

566
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,461

 matter.

we could fly her up, in the

 5 miles from here.

 is definitely nobody home.

 be some supplies, maybe a
 radio.

 that is in open country?

874
00:59:49,934 --> 00:59:53,590
-How can anyone survive
 down there?
 -You'd be surprised.

875
01:00:08,082 --> 01:00:09,431
Is it infected?

876
01:00:09,606 --> 01:00:11,085
I can't tell.

877
01:00:16,134 --> 01:00:20,617
I don't know. My first-aid
 training was a long time ago.

878
01:00:21,835 --> 01:00:23,402
Help me up.

879
01:00:23,576 --> 01:00:25,534
No. Not now.

880
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:28,537
Come on, I feel fine.
 Everybody else is doing all
 the work. Let me up!

881
01:00:28,712 --> 01:00:30,148
-No.
 -Dad, just stay put, okay?

882
01:00:31,279 --> 01:00:32,541
I'll be back in a while.

883
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:36,633
Be careful!

884
01:00:45,032 --> 01:00:49,123
Everything you said last night
 about the family...
 Were you serious?

885
01:00:49,907 --> 01:00:50,864
What do you think?

886
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,870
I had hoped things would
 improve on their own.

887
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,439
I let things slide, too.

888
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:02,963
We're all responsible.

889
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,882
Give a little. You don't have
 to win every battle.

890
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:14,671
It's not too late.

891
01:01:26,378 --> 01:01:27,858
What are you looking for?

892
01:01:28,902 --> 01:01:29,990
Testing a theory.

893
01:01:33,602 --> 01:01:38,564
This must have been a
 trappers' camp. Cabin.
 Tanning shed.

894
01:01:38,738 --> 01:01:40,697
So what's missing?

895
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:42,524
What is this, some kind of
 a test?

896
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,136
-Pop quiz.
 -Hm.

897
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:52,447
What's missing is storage.
 Some place to store food

898
01:01:52,621 --> 01:01:54,885
carcasses, anything edible.

899
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:58,062
Safe from rodents or
scavengers, while you're out
maybe days at a time

900
01:01:58,236 --> 01:02:00,455
tending to your trap lines.

901
01:02:00,629 --> 01:02:05,678
So, you dig a cellar. It
doesn't have to be big, just
big enough.

902
01:02:05,852 --> 01:02:08,202
And you wall it off
 with rocks.

903
01:02:08,376 --> 01:02:09,987
Wouldn't that be back up at
 the cabin?

904
01:02:10,161 --> 01:02:13,730
I checked. It's not.
 But maybe it's down here.

905
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:17,951
Yeah, but you're talking about
 what, 50, 100 years ago?

906
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:20,475
-Yep.
 -And, besides, there's that
 refrigerator up at the cabin.

907
01:02:20,649 --> 01:02:22,347
And no electricity.

908
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:25,045
They powered that by generator
 when somebody was here

909
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:28,440
but they had to have some
place to store supplies from
year to year.

910
01:02:30,485 --> 01:02:35,316
If there were an old cellar,
still dry and secure,
that's what I'd use.

911
01:02:39,538 --> 01:02:44,325
Rick! Rick! [LAUGHING]

912
01:02:54,074 --> 01:02:57,034
It's as tough as shoe leather.

913
01:02:57,208 --> 01:03:01,516
It's jerky.
 Venison, I believe.
 It'll soften up.

914
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:04,781
Charlie, this was inspired.

915
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:07,653
I just wish there were more.

916
01:03:07,827 --> 01:03:10,656
I'm so hungry I could eat
 pine needles.

917
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,615
Did you see any smoke coming
out of the chimney when you
were outside?

918
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:16,923
Not much.

919
01:03:17,097 --> 01:03:20,971
You see, where we're situated
 here, the smoke blows down
 the valley.

920
01:03:21,145 --> 01:03:24,801
We need to go higher if we're
going to signal a rescue team.

921
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:27,891
You don't think they're
looking for us by now?

922
01:03:28,065 --> 01:03:31,372
Susan knows we would
 have called.
 And Grandma and Grandpa.

923
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:33,200
Yeah.

924
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:36,900
It's clear right now, but it
 could change any minute.

925
01:03:37,074 --> 01:03:43,907
We should go up there right
 away with the flares and this,
 and wait up there.

926
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:46,866
How long?

927
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:50,783
If it stays clear, they'll fly
all night.
They know every minute counts.

928
01:03:50,957 --> 01:03:55,744
We hear a plane overhead, we
 light the flares, they see it,
 they can't miss that.

929
01:03:55,919 --> 01:04:00,010
At least here we have partial
 shelter, a fireplace,
 wood to burn.

930
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:03,317
To keep that fire going, we'd
 burn ourselves out of shelter
 in a couple of days.

931
01:04:05,232 --> 01:04:10,847
But if we go up the mountain
and a rescue plane doesn't
fly over?

932
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:14,851
It's too big a risk.
 I think we should keep this as
 our base.

933
01:04:17,201 --> 01:04:18,289
Yes or no?

934
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:23,337
Yes.

-All clear, Pete.
 -Okay, thanks, HQ.
 Over and out.

937
01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:50,060
Okay.
 We're going back to refuel

938
01:04:50,234 --> 01:04:52,497
and, if the weather holds,
 we'll come back out again.

939
01:04:52,671 --> 01:04:55,239
-Sounds right.
-Nothing from the
other spotters?

940
01:04:55,413 --> 01:04:56,893
Nothing yet.

941
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:05,162
What's that?

942
01:05:07,555 --> 01:05:11,908
Avalanche. And recent, too.
 You see it all the time
 up here.

943
01:05:19,437 --> 01:05:22,919
Let's go back.
 I saw something.

944
01:05:59,129 --> 01:06:03,960
Mom? There's no more.

945
01:06:29,115 --> 01:06:31,988
Hey, Mike, we just got a
 strong hit here.

You're welcome.

 you in the last few days that
 bummed you out,

949
01:07:25,084 --> 01:07:27,956
forgive me. I'm sorry.
 I apologize.

 coming, Hun?

951

As long as we don't get
 snowed on.

954
01:07:44,973 --> 01:07:50,283
Tomorrow, if we're still here,
 we'll try to build a signal
 fire to go with it.

955
01:07:50,457 --> 01:07:53,243
I'll be feeling better by
 then. I'll be able to help.

956
01:07:53,417 --> 01:07:57,638
Nah, we can handle it, Dad.
You have to take it easy, huh?

957
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:05,385
Well, I appreciate you all,
taking good care of me.

958
01:08:08,345 --> 01:08:14,090
I know I've been a pain in
 the butt. But I'll make it up
 to all of you. I promise.

-I love you, Daddy.
 -Thanks, Hun.

960
01:08:51,475 --> 01:08:54,652
It's relatively intact,
 but really buried.

961
01:08:54,826 --> 01:08:56,828
We need earth moving equipment
 to get it out.

962
01:08:57,002 --> 01:08:58,917
Now, we may be able to dig a
 tunnel. The guys are still

963
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:02,138
arguing about how we'd make
 it stable.

964
01:09:02,312 --> 01:09:05,141
Even if we go ahead,
 it's going to take time.

965
01:09:08,753 --> 01:09:10,146
A couple of days.

966
01:09:11,408 --> 01:09:14,280
Did the sensors pick up
 any sounds?

967
01:09:14,454 --> 01:09:18,415
Metal contracting, that's it.
 And no response to
 our signals.

968
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:21,505
So, you're saying they're
 buried under there.

969
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:25,639
The most likely scenario is
 the crash triggered
 the avalanche.

970
01:09:25,813 --> 01:09:28,599
They could be alive and not
 able to respond.

971
01:09:28,773 --> 01:09:32,646
We'll try the tunnel. Just
wait here, I'll be right back.

He's gone up the mountain.

980
01:11:30,982 --> 01:11:35,465
He's gone up the mountain to
signal for help. He told us
so in so many words.

981
01:11:35,639 --> 01:11:37,336
But he knows he's hurt.

982
01:11:37,510 --> 01:11:40,600

 happened is
 his responsibility.

1037
01:17:01,529 --> 01:17:03,444
Hey, Mom.

1038
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:07,710
-He's too cold.
 -I'm not cold,
 I'm stupid, huh?

1039
01:17:07,884 --> 01:17:10,756
Loveable idiot.
 Where's the flare?

1040
01:17:10,930 --> 01:17:12,323
I think it's in my pocket.

1041
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:22,638
-Everybody okay?
 -We're fine.

1042
01:17:22,812 --> 01:17:24,030
How did you find me?

1043
01:17:25,553 --> 01:17:27,947
We followed your big,
 fat tracks.

1044
01:17:31,168 --> 01:17:34,737
I'm never going anywhere again
 without at least a pound of
 this stuff.

1045
01:17:34,911 --> 01:17:36,913
Trail mix any day.

1046
01:17:37,087 --> 01:17:40,830
Chocolate bars. Pure energy.

1047
01:17:41,004 --> 01:17:45,530
That reminds me. It's time to
review the menu for tomorrow's

1048
01:17:45,704 --> 01:17:48,185
fabulous wedding
 anniversary feast.

1049
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:49,882
Congratulations, by the way.

1050
01:17:50,056 --> 01:17:52,363
-How many years, Dad?
 -Many.

1051
01:17:53,233 --> 01:17:54,670
I'll ignore that.

1052
01:17:56,280 --> 01:18:01,894
Okay. We start with a 12-pound
 ham. Honey orange glaze.

1053
01:18:02,068 --> 01:18:04,549
-Mmmm!
 -What else?

1054
01:18:04,723 --> 01:18:06,377
No, no! Have mercy!

1055
01:18:06,551 --> 01:18:10,729
Oh, no. This is good. Have you
 ever heard of thermic burn?

1056
01:18:10,903 --> 01:18:16,561
If you think about food,
pretend to smell it,
taste it even

1057
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:20,783
you can fool your body into
 reacting like you've actually
 eaten something.

1058
01:18:20,957 --> 01:18:24,787
It raises your metabolic rate,
 warms you up.

1059
01:18:24,961 --> 01:18:26,702
See why we need a teacher in
the family?

1060
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:34,710
-For times like this.
 -What times like this?
 [LAUGHS]

1061
01:18:34,884 --> 01:18:39,715
Well, the world needs great
 teachers, and Charlie's going
 to be a great teacher.

1062
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:51,988
See? You were right. Your Dad
 and I just had to spend a
 little quality time together.

1063
01:18:52,162 --> 01:18:55,948
Hey. How about mashed potatoes
 and country gravy?

1064
01:18:56,122 --> 01:19:00,126
Green bean casserole with
 slivered almonds and
 bacon bits.

1065
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:03,826
-Lemon cream pie.
 -Pumpkin pie!

1066
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:07,481
Both!
 Anyone feeling warmer yet?

1067
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:09,092
I'm cooking!

1068
01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:15,446
I wonder what Susan's doing?

1069
01:19:19,232 --> 01:19:23,759
Susan's thinking about us,
 thinking about her.

1070
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:35,205
Now, we all have to keep each
 other awake. No exceptions.

1071
01:19:35,379 --> 01:19:38,077
Daddy? Did you hear the
 helicopter before?

1072
01:19:39,905 --> 01:19:41,298
No. When?

1073
01:19:41,472 --> 01:19:43,822
-On our way up the mountain.
-Yeah, we all saw it.

1074
01:19:43,996 --> 01:19:48,871
Oh, that's good.
 Then it'll be back.
 You still got the flares?

1075
01:19:49,045 --> 01:19:52,178
-Yeah.
 -Don't be afraid to use them.

1076
01:19:52,352 --> 01:19:55,747
Even if they don't find us
tonight, they'll find us for
sure tomorrow.

1077
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,270
There's no way they can miss
the X.

1078
01:19:57,444 --> 01:19:59,795
The X. That was a good idea.

1079
01:20:00,839 --> 01:20:02,798
-Hey, Rick?
-What?

1080
01:20:02,972 --> 01:20:06,802
Next time, you can fly us up.

1081
01:20:08,107 --> 01:20:11,807
-Think I can handle it?
 -Sure.

1082
01:20:34,699 --> 01:20:37,223
Whether we're talking about
 one kid or the whole family

1083
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:39,660
maybe hurt,
 scared, disoriented

1084
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:42,925
you know as well as I do,
 the bodies could be a mile
 from the crash

1085
01:20:43,099 --> 01:20:44,665
buried under a drift and we
 wouldn't find them
 till spring.

1086
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:45,841
Here you go.

1087
01:20:47,581 --> 01:20:49,757
What's that?

1088
01:20:49,932 --> 01:20:53,936
That's a weather report.
 It's warmer today.
 It's good visibility.

1089
01:20:54,110 --> 01:20:56,112
We'll get all our spotters
 out. It'll go faster.

1090
01:20:57,809 --> 01:21:01,857
So, how cold did it get out
 there last night?

1091
01:21:02,945 --> 01:21:03,859
About 10 below.

1092
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:09,865
What's a 48-hour threshold?

1093
01:21:12,519 --> 01:21:15,914
No secrets. You promised.

1094
01:21:16,088 --> 01:21:20,876
It's a rule of thumb that
 says, if you're lost under
 these conditions

1095
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:26,403
inadequate food and shelter,
 that your chances of survival
 drop way off after two days.

1096
01:21:27,970 --> 01:21:29,493
It's been longer than that.

1097
01:21:29,667 --> 01:21:32,061
They're alive, and they're not
 under any snow drifts.

1098
01:21:32,235 --> 01:21:34,933
-Jack, you can't quit!
 -We're not quitting.

1099
01:21:35,107 --> 01:21:38,894
We're in continuous radio
contact with snowmobile units.

1100
01:21:39,068 --> 01:21:41,374
We've got dog teams and
 medevac standing by.

1101
01:21:41,548 --> 01:21:42,636
If they're there,
 we'll find them!

1102
01:21:42,810 --> 01:21:44,203
They're there.

1103
01:21:56,085 --> 01:22:00,872
It's okay, Charlie.
 I'm not cold anymore.

1104
01:22:01,742 --> 01:22:05,094
-Honey?
 -Hm?

1105
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:10,447
We're gonna get you
 out, Carla.

1106
01:22:10,621 --> 01:22:14,494
-No.
-Carla!

1107
01:22:18,759 --> 01:22:22,894
Rick! Rick!
 Help me get her up.

1108
01:22:23,068 --> 01:22:24,722
-What?
 -Help me get her up.

1109
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,897
Stop it!

1110
01:22:30,249 --> 01:22:33,165
-Come on.
-What's wrong?

1111
01:22:33,339 --> 01:22:35,951
Come on. Pins and needles.

1112
01:22:37,648 --> 01:22:39,955
My God! Ricky!

1113
01:22:41,826 --> 01:22:43,349
Rub his legs.

1114
01:22:51,705 --> 01:22:52,706
Okay, okay.

1115
01:22:58,538 --> 01:22:59,539
Tom?

1116
01:23:03,326 --> 01:23:04,022
Honey?

1117
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:10,376
I can't wake him.

1118
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:12,988
You know what this is?

1119
01:23:16,904 --> 01:23:18,210
Hypothermia.

1120
01:23:27,089 --> 01:23:28,003
Where are you going?

1121
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:31,006
I'm going to look
 for firewood.

1122
01:23:33,312 --> 01:23:34,052
Wait!

1123
01:23:38,578 --> 01:23:45,063
Listen, whatever happens,
 you get home.

1124
01:23:48,284 --> 01:23:51,113
I'll be back,
 with the firewood.

1125
01:24:01,079 --> 01:24:05,431
Rick! Rick, I heard something!

1126
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:11,046
I don't hear it, Mom.

1127
01:24:18,401 --> 01:24:20,751
-No, it's the wind.
 -Listen!

1128
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:25,190
-[ENGINE SOUNDS]
-There!

1129
01:24:27,627 --> 01:24:30,369
Help! Help!

1130
01:24:36,288 --> 01:24:40,988
We're too far away.
 You're going to have to go
 where they are.

1131
01:24:41,163 --> 01:24:43,382
-Go! Go!
 -You can do this!

1132
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:44,514
Go!

1133
01:25:34,433 --> 01:25:36,131
Wait!

1134
01:26:28,879 --> 01:26:31,447
[ENGINE SOUNDS]

1135
01:26:55,340 --> 01:27:01,390
They're alive, but they're
 hypothermic, and there's at
 least one injury.

1136
01:27:01,564 --> 01:27:03,696
They've had medication,
 they've had heat

1137
01:27:03,870 --> 01:27:06,438
but they've been through a
lot, so don't expect too much.

1138
01:27:06,612 --> 01:27:08,223
-Okay.
 -Are you all right?

1139
01:27:08,397 --> 01:27:13,097
-Thank you.
 -Thank yourself.

1140
01:27:15,491 --> 01:27:17,319
Will you do something for me?

1141
01:27:17,493 --> 01:27:20,670
-Name it.
 -Go home!

1142
01:27:20,844 --> 01:27:23,063
I will if you will.

1143
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:27,024
Nice and easy, now, guys.

1144
01:27:29,940 --> 01:27:31,246
All right, go ahead!

1145
01:27:37,121 --> 01:27:39,950
Carla! I'm sorry.

1146
01:27:40,124 --> 01:27:41,430
I'm so glad to see you!

1147
01:27:41,604 --> 01:27:44,563
Hold up. Hold up! Carla!

1148
01:27:44,737 --> 01:27:46,043
Mom!

1149
01:27:46,217 --> 01:27:48,393
How are you feeling?
 Are you okay?

1150
01:27:48,567 --> 01:27:51,222
Sweetheart, what you must have
 been through!

1151
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,053
Good move missing this
 trip.

1152
01:27:59,448 --> 01:28:02,668
Daddy. Daddy, it's Susan.

1153
01:28:04,148 --> 01:28:05,367
Hi, sweetheart.

1154
01:28:06,585 --> 01:28:08,457
Daddy, I love you.

1155
01:28:08,631 --> 01:28:11,242
I love you, too, Sis.

1156
01:28:18,641 --> 01:28:20,338
We made it, didn't we, Mom?

1157
01:28:20,512 --> 01:28:23,950
We had to.
 There's a lot left to do.

1158
01:28:27,519 --> 01:28:30,174
Hey, happy anniversary.

1159
01:28:31,436 --> 01:28:33,046
It certainly is.
