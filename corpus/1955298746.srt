I loved music.

21
00:01:13,521 --> 00:01:15,455
And as soon as I could,

22
00:01:15,457 --> 00:01:17,357
I started a band
with my two best friends,

23
00:01:17,359 --> 00:01:19,292
Owen and Lawrence.

24
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:21,060
The Style Boyz.

25
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:22,696
Right away, people noticed us

26
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:23,997
because our lyrics
were beautiful

27
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:25,831

The thing about the Style Boyz

33
00:01:37,312 --> 00:01:38,711
is that their chemistry
and their friendship

34
00:01:38,713 --> 00:01:39,845
was really authentic.

35
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:41,081
You know, you could tell

36
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,649
that they were really friends
with each other.

37
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,849
They were hot. (chuckles)

38
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:44,985
CONNER:
Before you knew it,

39
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:46,018
we signed with a major label

40
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,586
and put out our first single,

41
00:01:47,588 --> 00:01:48,988

USHER: Kid Contact, he handled
the beats and the music.

57
00:02:17,419 --> 00:02:19,119
Kid Brain, you know,
he did all the lyrics.

58
00:02:19,121 --> 00:02:20,853
And then Conner,
he was the charismatic one,

59
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,589
the one who
brought it all together.

60
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:24,490
You-you tell me
you didn't see him and say,

61
00:02:24,492 --> 00:02:25,859
"Yo, he's the star."

62
00:02:25,861 --> 00:02:28,794
CONNER: Things definitely
started to get complicated.

63
00:02:28,796 --> 00:02:31,565
I couldn't help it
if the world chose me.

64
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:32,998
- MAN: Take one.
- You want me to look here?

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,502
Pretty funny, right? (laughs)

66
00:02:35,504 --> 00:02:36,836
Be original,

67
00:02:36,838 --> 00:02:38,672
be fearless.

68
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:40,841
I love my White Butt Jeans.

69
00:02:40,843 --> 00:02:43,810
As my star kept burning
brighter, some stood by me.

70
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:44,946
Others couldn't take the heat.

71
00:02:55,456 --> 00:02:56,823
CONNER:
We broke up the next day.

72
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:59,759
I went solo,
and Owen became my DJ.

73
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:02,027
Lawrence quit
the music biz altogether.

74
00:03:02,029 --> 00:03:05,465
And our DJ Francis moved
to Japan to hunt dolphins,

75
00:03:05,467 --> 00:03:06,833
like a dickhead.

76
00:03:06,835 --> 00:03:08,602
But it turned out all of that

77
00:03:08,604 --> 00:03:10,704
was just a blessing
in disguise,

78
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:13,539
because it turned me
into Conner4Real.

79
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,674
I dropped my first album,
and what can I say?

80
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:17,510
It was a smash.

81
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,645
And I owed it all to my fans,

82
00:03:19,647 --> 00:03:21,847
who I share everything with.

83
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:23,616
Yo, brushing my teeth.

84
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:25,852
Yo, I just ate a taco.

85
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:28,454
It's Conner's Confessions:
Hoverboard Edition.

86
00:03:28,456 --> 00:03:29,756
(chuckles) Oh, fuck!

87
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,157
(grunts, whimpers)
Dude.

88
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:33,926
Yo, just got my butt waxed.

89
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:35,929
That shit hurt!

90
00:03:35,931 --> 00:03:37,430
He's painfully honest
with his fans,

91
00:03:37,432 --> 00:03:38,431
probably too honest, really.

92
00:03:38,433 --> 00:03:40,099
Like, but they love him for it.

93
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,601
Yo.

94
00:03:41,603 --> 00:03:43,203
Just jacked it.

95
00:03:43,205 --> 00:03:45,739
Um, feeling pretty mellow
right now.

96
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:47,841

- Doinkdedoink!

97
00:03:47,843 --> 00:03:48,908

99
00:03:51,045 --> 00:03:52,679
I think he's incredible.

100
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,580
He really is the real deal.

101
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:56,682
CONNER:
My fans and me,

102
00:03:56,684 --> 00:03:58,617
we're in love.

103
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:02,455
My songs are love letters.

104
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:05,125
And the arena is our bedroom.

105
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:07,860

00:04:07,862 --> 00:04:09,996

because I'm probably the most

154
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,212
MAN: Yeah, well, it's a pretty
exciting time right now.

155
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:10,684
Conner's second album, his
second solo album, CONNquest,

156
00:06:10,686 --> 00:06:12,085
is dropping in two weeks.

157
00:06:12,087 --> 00:06:14,821
And then we go
on the world tour.

158
00:06:14,823 --> 00:06:16,856
- Harry, get in here, man.
- I've been Conner's manager

159
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:18,157
since back with
the Style Boyz.

160
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:20,893
It used to be the four of us
riding around in a van,

161
00:06:20,895 --> 00:06:22,662
but, uh, with success,

162
00:06:22,664 --> 00:06:24,763
our family had to get
a little bit bigger.

163
00:06:24,765 --> 00:06:29,035
Sure, Conner surrounds himself
with people who are agreeable.

164
00:06:29,037 --> 00:06:30,669
I wouldn't call them yes men.

165
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:32,172
- Money!

166
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:33,373
(laughter)

167
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,773
- Did it go in?
- Swish!

168
00:06:34,775 --> 00:06:36,075
Oh, it went in, it went in!

169
00:06:36,077 --> 00:06:37,376
You a murderer, son!

170
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:39,179
Well, Conner currently
has 32 people

171
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,446
on his personal payroll.

172
00:06:40,448 --> 00:06:43,248
He has a personal assistant,
a party coordinator,

173
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,217
an ab trainer,
basketball coach,

174
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,653
an eyebrow specialist,
sneaker jockey,

175
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,655
two umbrella wranglers,
a weed roller,

176
00:06:49,657 --> 00:06:50,790
- a weed holder,
- (sirens wailing)

177
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:53,092
a turtle sitter for Maximus,
scarf caddy,

178
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:54,561
- a guy who punches him in the nuts
- (groans)

179
00:06:54,563 --> 00:06:56,763
- so that he remembers where he came from...
- You're right.

180
00:06:56,765 --> 00:06:58,267
...a perspective manipulator...

181
00:07:00,402 --> 00:07:03,236
Oh, that's a guy who's, uh,
slightly shorter than Conner

182
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:06,039
who he pays
to stand near him at events

183
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:07,873
to make him look taller.

184
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,409
You know,
back in my high school days,

185
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:11,277
I was in a band.

186
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:14,147
You may heard of them...
called Tony! Toni! Toné! TonEe?

187
00:07:14,149 --> 00:07:16,816
We broke up
over creative differences.

188
00:07:16,818 --> 00:07:19,318
Each Tony had an exclamation
point after their name,

189
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,821
and I thought my name
should have a question mark.

190
00:07:21,823 --> 00:07:24,758
So it would be
Tony! Toni! Toné! TonEe?

191
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,861
In hindsight,
it was not my best decision.

192
00:07:27,863 --> 00:07:29,729
But that led me to Conner.

193
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,898
So who's laughing now?

194
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,066
CONNER:
There you go, buddy.

195
00:07:33,068 --> 00:07:34,099
Ow, dude.

196
00:07:34,101 --> 00:07:35,669
You bit me, Max.

197
00:07:35,671 --> 00:07:37,671
This is my best friend Maximus.

198
00:07:37,673 --> 00:07:40,140
My mom gave him to me
when I was nine years old.

199
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:42,142
Like, right after my dad died.

200
00:07:42,144 --> 00:07:43,910
I feel like he's, like,
the closest thing

201
00:07:43,912 --> 00:07:46,046
I've ever had to, like,
a little brother or something.

202
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:49,448
If I had, like, a mute brother
that was hella scaly.

203
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,784
As a hatchling,
the doctors said

204
00:07:50,786 --> 00:07:54,287
that he had been diagnosed
with soggy bones syndrome,

205
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:58,224
and that he was not gonna
make it past, like, six months.

206
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,092
But that was 20 years ago.

207
00:08:00,094 --> 00:08:02,361
You're my best friend.

208
00:08:02,363 --> 00:08:04,463
(whispers):
Don't tell Owen.

209
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:07,434
Come on up here. This is
Owen's world right here.

210
00:08:07,436 --> 00:08:10,003
This is where I keep
all my gear.

211
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,905
This is one of the earliest,
uh, synths I ever got.

212
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:15,010
It's a DX7. This is a classic.

213
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:19,044
Oh, in Conner's show? No, no.

214
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:20,446
In Conner's show,
I just use this.

215
00:08:20,448 --> 00:08:23,117
Uh, it's a iPod.

216
00:08:24,149 --> 00:08:26,919
60 gigs, so, you know,
I can fit the entire show,

217
00:08:26,921 --> 00:08:29,188
and, uh, plus, like,
a bunch of dope audio books.

218
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,924
You know?

219
00:08:30,926 --> 00:08:32,926
NARRATOR (over speakers):
It was year three at Hogwarts,

220
00:08:32,928 --> 00:08:35,261
and Harry was worried
it would never get any easier.

221
00:08:35,263 --> 00:08:36,832
Harry P.

222
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,801
You know, a lot of people
ask me that.

223
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:43,036
They say, like, "Is it weird

224
00:08:43,038 --> 00:08:44,771
"for you to be playing
the background now?

225
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:46,973
'Cause, you know,
you used to be in Style Boyz."

226
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,841
And I always say,
"No, man, not at all, man,

227
00:08:48,843 --> 00:08:51,911
'cause I-I could never do
what Conner does, you know?"

228
00:08:51,913 --> 00:08:53,446
CONNER:
Look, I'm a perfectionist.

229
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,382
My first album sold
four million copies.

230
00:08:56,384 --> 00:08:58,951
So this one has to sell more.

231
00:08:58,953 --> 00:09:00,854
And that's why I take this
so seriously, you know?

232
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:02,755
And I-I live for this music.

233
00:09:02,757 --> 00:09:05,157
And... (sighs)

234
00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:07,460
It can't go away.

235
00:09:07,462 --> 00:09:10,196
That's why I personally wrote
every song on this record,

236
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:13,800
and I used over 100 producers
for just 17 tracks

237
00:09:13,802 --> 00:09:16,136
to guarantee
that they're all hits.

238
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,370
I made a lot of the beats
on the first record,

239
00:09:18,372 --> 00:09:21,941
but on this one, Conner said
he really wanted to branch out.

240
00:09:21,943 --> 00:09:23,909
It's good for him to grow,
you know?

241
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:26,012
And, also, I played him
a bunch of my beats,

242
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:27,116
and he was like, "No."

243
00:09:32,453 --> 00:09:33,485
CONNER:
What's up, y'all?

244
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:35,120
Got a hot new single coming.

245
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:37,157
And it addresses
some social issues

246
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,057
that I think are being ignored.

247
00:09:39,059 --> 00:09:40,393
So keep your eyes peeled
for that.

248
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,561
We're gonna be
surprise releasing it

249
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:43,028

00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,830

Usually, I don't like

310
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,542

311
00:11:36,544 --> 00:11:38,244
I'm just excited.

312
00:11:38,246 --> 00:11:39,646
Like, I can't, I can't wait.

313
00:11:39,648 --> 00:11:41,446
I want to know
how people feel about it,

314
00:11:41,448 --> 00:11:44,050
and I want to know
how much they love it, so...

315
00:11:44,052 --> 00:11:45,450
uh, here we go.

Um...

00:11:50,257 --> 00:11:52,292
Well, it's Pitchfork, it's...

319
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,395
They gave it a negative review.

320
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:58,498
No, like, it's a negative four

321
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,234
out of ten...
positive ten, I assume.

322
00:12:02,236 --> 00:12:05,504
Pitchfork can be kind of
pretentious though, so...

323
00:12:05,506 --> 00:12:07,473
But ooh. What?

324
00:12:07,475 --> 00:12:09,542
You ain't gonna knock
my hustle.

325
00:12:09,544 --> 00:12:11,009
Let's look at another one.

326
00:12:11,011 --> 00:12:13,479
Let's pull it up.
Rolling Stone.

327
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,214
Okay.

328
00:12:15,216 --> 00:12:19,085
Um, out of four possible stars,

329
00:12:19,087 --> 00:12:22,021
Rolling Stone has given it...

330
00:12:22,023 --> 00:12:24,056
the shit emoji.

331
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:28,194
I can only assume it's a, um,
a mess-up, you know?

332
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:32,565
They must've had a-a problem
with their, um...

333
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:34,533
No, this seems like
the right score

334
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:36,369
for how they're saying this.

335
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:39,004
You know what,
let's just do a search.

336
00:12:39,006 --> 00:12:42,441
- (typing)
- CONNquest review.

337
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,143
Oh, here we go.

338
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:47,080

342
00:12:52,252 --> 00:12:53,753
This is on...

343
00:12:53,755 --> 00:12:55,253
The Onion.

344
00:12:55,255 --> 00:12:57,990
So, you know, mixed.

345
00:12:57,992 --> 00:13:00,258
Let's call it mixed reviews.

346
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,561
BIG BOY:
So first you're in a group.

347
00:13:02,563 --> 00:13:04,464
You introduced us
to the Style Boyz.

348
00:13:04,466 --> 00:13:06,733
And "Donkey Roll," of course,
we play the hell out of that.

349
00:13:06,735 --> 00:13:08,468
That's a hit for us, man,

350
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,769
and then, Conner,
you get that breakout moment.

351
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,038
You get a phone call
from Claudia Cantrell.

352
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,273
The one and only.

353
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,707
And she asks you
for a verse, man,

354
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:17,409
on her song,
"Turn Up the Beef."

355
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:21,247
♪ Turn up the beef ♪

356
00:13:21,249 --> 00:13:24,683
♪ Throw your body
on the flame... ♪

357
00:13:24,685 --> 00:13:27,452
But you take that moment,
and instead of just, like,

358
00:13:27,454 --> 00:13:29,555
kicking a regular verse...
you know what I'm saying...

359
00:13:29,557 --> 00:13:31,023
you did something
a little different.

360
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,091
The "catchphrase verse,"
as it's now known.

361
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:34,027
Uh-oh, yeah, yeah. Hello.

362
00:13:34,029 --> 00:13:35,527
Um, I had been working
on a catchphrase,

363
00:13:35,529 --> 00:13:37,062
but what had happened was

364
00:13:37,064 --> 00:13:38,531
I just thought
of so many dope ones

365
00:13:38,533 --> 00:13:40,266
that I was like,
"What if I put them

366
00:13:40,268 --> 00:13:42,468
all into the verse?"

367
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,802
♪ Turn up the beef ♪

368
00:13:43,804 --> 00:13:45,338
♪ It's Conner bitch, say word ♪

369
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,205
♪ D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-Dilbert ♪

370
00:13:47,207 --> 00:13:49,142
♪ Doinkdedoink, sorry, Dad ♪

371
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:51,444
♪ Dinkynuts, squirrel jam,
hats... ♪

372
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:53,479
Yeah, he said so many words
I didn't know.

373
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:54,814
That was
a game-changing moment.

374
00:13:54,816 --> 00:13:56,782
50 CENT: There's usually, like,
one catchphrase in a hit.

375
00:13:56,784 --> 00:13:59,786
He dropped, like, 30 on us
in one night. Shit was crazy.

376
00:13:59,788 --> 00:14:02,354
♪ D.J. Tanner, swanky pumps ♪

377
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:05,557
♪ M-M-Moped music, Costco
samples like a mothafucka ♪

378
00:14:05,559 --> 00:14:07,159
♪ Uuuunngh, crank up the mids ♪

379
00:14:07,161 --> 00:14:08,795
♪ Patrick Stewart money ♪

380
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:11,830
♪ You know who it is,
Conner4Real. ♪

381
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,599
Immediately, I said,
man, this guy right here,

382
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,100
he's gonna make it big.

383
00:14:15,102 --> 00:14:16,569
Because when you have
a catchphrase,

384
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:19,504
the world is catched
by your phrase.

385
00:14:19,506 --> 00:14:20,773
BIG BOY: You fast-forward.
Things start to happen, man.

386
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:22,108
You get
the-the Pop Music Award.

387
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,844
And now, here comes those
offers of a solo contract.

388
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,412
CONNER:
Yeah.

389
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:28,214
How did the other Style Boyz
feel about that?

390
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:29,648
- You know, they took it fine.
- Mm-hmm.

391
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,350
Owen is my DJ
and my best friend.

392
00:14:32,352 --> 00:14:33,619
- That's good, man.
- And Lawrence

393
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:36,221
- lives on a farm now, so...
- Hold on.

394
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,724
Lawrence Dunn is a farmer?

395
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,759
(bird squawking)

396
00:14:40,761 --> 00:14:42,427
LAWRENCE:
My name is Lawrence Dunn.

397
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:44,564
I used to be in the Style Boyz.

398
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:45,864
Now I'm a farmer.

399
00:14:45,866 --> 00:14:47,633
Being out here in nature,

400
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,402
away from all the people

401
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:52,471
and the trappings of
modern life, it's so peaceful.

402
00:14:52,473 --> 00:14:54,507
- There's nothing like it.
- (groans in pain)

403
00:14:54,509 --> 00:14:57,375
- I've never been happier.
- (bird screeches)

404
00:14:57,377 --> 00:14:59,244
Uh, so yeah, this is, uh,

405
00:14:59,246 --> 00:15:00,479
all my woodwork.

406
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:02,849
It's kind of my passion,
uh, my hobby.

407
00:15:02,851 --> 00:15:04,149
This is a nice piece.

408
00:15:04,151 --> 00:15:06,351
It's called
"Government in Crisis."

409
00:15:06,353 --> 00:15:08,620
For obvious reasons.

410
00:15:08,622 --> 00:15:09,622
This one's a mask.

411
00:15:09,624 --> 00:15:10,889
Still me.

412
00:15:10,891 --> 00:15:12,492
It's a hat.

413
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,627
You know,
we were going places as a band.

414
00:15:14,629 --> 00:15:16,295
We had plans as a band.

415
00:15:16,297 --> 00:15:17,662
Style Boyz, that's three guys,

416
00:15:17,664 --> 00:15:20,532
not two...
it doesn't work with two.

417
00:15:20,534 --> 00:15:22,301
You know?
It's like a tricycle.

418
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:24,436
You take away one of
the wheels, what do you got?

419
00:15:24,438 --> 00:15:26,538
Nothin'. A bicycle.

420
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,206
Don't use that.

421
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,774
Look, we had a good run,
you know?

422
00:15:29,776 --> 00:15:30,843
We had a few hits.

423
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:32,845
But it had run its course,
you know?

424
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,412
It was time for us

425
00:15:34,414 --> 00:15:35,648
to all move on.

426
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,249
Get over it.

427
00:15:37,251 --> 00:15:39,652
When the Style Boyz broke up...
(sighs)

428
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:41,320
Damn.

429
00:15:41,322 --> 00:15:45,358
The only other time
I remember being that sad...

430
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,195
was when they killed
Josh Charles on The Good Wife.

Listen to this, homies.

448
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,431
We can upload your entire album

449
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:28,301
to fridges, washer-dryers,

00:16:28,303 --> 00:16:30,503

451
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:31,704
You could do that?

452
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:32,904
Yes, nerd.

453
00:16:32,906 --> 00:16:34,440
It's just Wi-Fi jibber-jabber.

454
00:16:34,442 --> 00:16:35,907
It's not a big deal.

455
00:16:35,909 --> 00:16:37,843
- Nobody doing appliance shit, my nigga.
- No.

456
00:16:37,845 --> 00:16:39,946
Is that right, my nigger?
No one is doing appliance shit.

457
00:16:39,948 --> 00:16:41,846
- Yeah.
- HARRY: Okay. Went with the hard "R."

458
00:16:41,848 --> 00:16:43,582
This is that
next, next, next, man.

459
00:16:43,584 --> 00:16:45,585
- I told y'all, Deborah's a genius!
- Mm.

460
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:48,620
It's true. And it is
also pronounced De-bor-ah.

461
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:50,623
De-bor-ah.
Oh, that's very cool.

462
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,591
- It's exotic.
- What's the origin of that?

463
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:54,759
Uh, I believe "Deborah."

464
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:56,762
- That was ridiculous!
- Right?

465
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:58,864
Oh, my God, yes,
that was insane.

466
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,599
I mean, who would want
to listen to music that way?

467
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,835
- (singsongy): Schwag!
- I know it's kind of weird,

468
00:17:02,837 --> 00:17:05,003
but Aquaspin's gonna help us
get the music out there, man.

469
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:07,505
I mean, so... you don't think
people are gonna have a problem

470
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,341
when music just appears
in their houses?

471
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:11,610
CONNER: Look, I know
it sounds lame, but...

472
00:17:11,612 --> 00:17:13,612
there's no such thing
as selling out anymore, man.

473
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:15,580
This is how big business works.

474
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,550
I mean, nowadays
if you don't sell out,

475
00:17:17,552 --> 00:17:19,619
people will wonder
if nobody asked you to.

476
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:20,753
- Right.
- But look, dude,

477
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:21,954
if you're not comfortable
with it,

478
00:17:21,956 --> 00:17:23,255
we could rethink it.

479
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:24,590
No, man, that's cool,
that's cool.

480
00:17:24,592 --> 00:17:25,590
All right, cool.

481
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:26,525
Let's get in the car.

482
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,459

sweat my ass off.

486
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,567
- A.C.

487

- Air condition.
- Macy's? Macy's?

488
00:17:36,036 --> 00:17:37,869
Sometimes Conner
just gets an idea

489
00:17:37,871 --> 00:17:39,804
and he runs with it, you know?

490
00:17:39,806 --> 00:17:44,542
And he's right,
like, 99.9% of the time, so...

491
00:17:44,544 --> 00:17:47,280
you just got to trust
that he knows what he's doing.

492
00:17:47,282 --> 00:17:48,648
So I understand why he,
you know,

493
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,349
did the whole Aquaspin thing.

that the Aquaspin thing

MAN:
Whoo!

729
00:27:22,156 --> 00:27:24,455
Conner, I love you! I love you!

730
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:26,124
Whoo!

731
00:27:26,126 --> 00:27:27,592
CONNER:
Harry! What the hell?!

732
00:27:27,594 --> 00:27:31,062
First of all,
this is an 18,000-seat arena.

733
00:27:31,064 --> 00:27:32,531
Nobody sells this out.

734
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,532
You sold 15,000 seats.
That's still really good.

735
00:27:34,534 --> 00:27:36,400
No, it's not good.

736
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:38,436
Hammerleg sold this place out
last week!

737
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:40,339
(sighs)
Well, Aquaspin agrees with you.

738
00:27:40,341 --> 00:27:42,206
They're concerned
about ticket sales.

739
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,076
What? But it's
an 18,000-seat place.

740
00:27:44,078 --> 00:27:45,343
Nobody sells that out.

741
00:27:45,345 --> 00:27:47,245
Hammerleg did. Last week.

742
00:27:47,247 --> 00:27:50,048
Look, the low record sales
are making them nervous.

743
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,149
They want to bring on
an opening act.

744
00:27:52,151 --> 00:27:54,386
What? We have an opening act.
Owen deejays.

745
00:27:54,388 --> 00:27:57,388
Hey, I'm always saying
Style Boyz could be the opener.

746
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:58,991
No, man.
Will you stop with that?

747
00:27:58,993 --> 00:28:00,458
Dude, people keep
blowing up my Twitter

748
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,093
about us doing "Donkey Roll."

749
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:03,561
- Oh, they're blowing up your Twitter?
- Yeah.

750
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,263
How many followers
do you have, Owen?

751
00:28:05,265 --> 00:28:07,599
- Like, 500,000.
- Okay, well, I got 20 million,

752
00:28:07,601 --> 00:28:09,967
and no one's asking me
to do that shit, so...

753
00:28:09,969 --> 00:28:11,602
- (laughter)
- Hey-oh!

754
00:28:11,604 --> 00:28:13,237
Some of those
are probably bots.

755
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:14,973
Okay, look, guys, regardless,

756
00:28:14,975 --> 00:28:17,208
we still have to decide
on an opening act.

757
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,409
Man. (sighs)

758
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:19,677
All right, fine.

759
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,379
Does anybody have ideas?

760
00:28:21,381 --> 00:28:23,548
One, but you are gonna like it.

761
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:26,217
Wait, did you say "are"
or "aren't"?

762
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:28,219
Are.

playing)

00:30:29,476 --> 00:30:32,244
CONNER: I had it
specially made for you, man.

828
00:30:32,246 --> 00:30:33,712
I took the measurements
while you were sleeping.

829
00:30:33,714 --> 00:30:37,249
It's, like, on some futuristic
EDM shit.

830
00:30:37,251 --> 00:30:40,318
We did the research,
and EDM is hot.

831
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,454

00:30:42,456 --> 00:30:44,555

- Look at all these functions.
- Yeah.

839
00:30:57,504 --> 00:30:59,437
It's like a Lite-Brite,
but it's moving.

840
00:30:59,439 --> 00:31:00,805
Oh, and check this out.

841
00:31:00,807 --> 00:31:02,706
OWEN:
Oh, wow.

842
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:04,542
- It goes all the way up there.
- All the way, man.

843
00:31:04,544 --> 00:31:06,244
It's like a beacon to space.

844

845
00:31:08,448 --> 00:31:11,315

00:31:11,317 --> 00:31:12,551
(electronic tone blaring)

847
00:31:12,553 --> 00:31:14,086
Wow!

848
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:15,553
Why would it make that sound?

849
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:17,755
I don't even know,
but it's nice to know

850
00:31:17,757 --> 00:31:19,323
that it's there if you need it.

851
00:31:19,325 --> 00:31:20,492
- You know?
- Yeah.

852
00:31:20,494 --> 00:31:22,093
Yo, helmet's dope.

853
00:31:22,095 --> 00:31:23,494
Looks like the tip
of Optimus Prime's dick.

855
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:26,764
Don't you want to look

00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:27,866
His dick?

857
00:31:27,868 --> 00:31:29,501
- Fuck yeah!
- Fuck yeah!

858
00:31:29,503 --> 00:31:31,602
Yeah, man. (chuckles)
I don't know.

859
00:31:31,604 --> 00:31:32,803
Owen.

860
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:34,272
Please?

861
00:31:34,274 --> 00:31:36,407
Please, please,
wear the helmet, Owen.

862
00:31:36,409 --> 00:31:37,876
Come on, man.
The show really needs it.

Please, man?

864
00:31:39,646 --> 00:31:42,214

- Yes!

00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:44,549

All right,
listen up, everybody.

915
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:19,644
First of all,
I want to say congratulations

916
00:33:19,646 --> 00:33:21,478
on a great show tonight!

917
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,746
Yeah, yeah!

00:33:22,748 --> 00:33:24,582
HARRY:
And for the last eight shows,

919
00:33:24,584 --> 00:33:26,517
we have been sold out!

It's like I was... I feel like
it's finally just clicking.

922
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,389
- Yeah.
- Hey!

923
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,993
- We are on a roll, baby.
- Yeah!

924
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,761
- Yeah.
- Is it helping album sales?

925
00:33:36,763 --> 00:33:39,496
- It's got to be, right?
- You know how it is, you know.

926
00:33:39,498 --> 00:33:41,899
Sometimes it takes a while for
the marketplace to catch up.

927
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:44,269
- Don't worry.
- Definitely helping Hunter.

928
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:46,670
This dude's album
just went gold.

929
00:33:46,672 --> 00:33:48,273
Gold?

930
00:33:48,275 --> 00:33:49,640
- For real.
- How is that even...

931
00:33:49,642 --> 00:33:51,376
That's a mistake, right?

932
00:33:51,378 --> 00:33:53,244
Our shit hasn't even gone gold.

933
00:33:53,246 --> 00:33:55,714
Look, he's just having
a moment, that's all.

934
00:33:55,716 --> 00:33:57,549
CONNER: Well, how come
I'm not having a moment?

935
00:33:57,551 --> 00:33:58,882
You've had tons of moments.

936
00:33:58,884 --> 00:34:00,318
Don't worry,
there's plenty to go around.

937

00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,526
Uh-oh, y'all.

RZA:
Hey, look, man,

953
00:34:36,122 --> 00:34:38,722
Conner got all the way to the
top of this business, you know?

954
00:34:38,724 --> 00:34:41,392
And the higher you get,
the harder you fall.

955
00:34:41,394 --> 00:34:43,827
- I mean, ask any coconut.
- PHARRELL: Thing is is that

956
00:34:43,829 --> 00:34:46,430
Conner's never been as good
as he was with the Style Boyz.

957
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,332
Whatever him and Lawrence
were beefing over,

958
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:49,934
they need to figure out
a way to squash it.

959
00:34:49,936 --> 00:34:53,604
CONNER:
Ever since Style Boyz broke up,

960
00:34:53,606 --> 00:34:55,539
Lawrence has been mad at me.

961
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:58,943
He claims he wrote
my famous catchphrase verse.

962
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:01,879
Translation:
He's a jealous-ass hater

963
00:35:01,881 --> 00:35:04,416
who's mad that I blew up
and he's a farmer

964
00:35:04,418 --> 00:35:05,916
out in bum-fuck nowhere.

965
00:35:05,918 --> 00:35:07,452
But, you know,

966
00:35:07,454 --> 00:35:09,486
we all have our take.

967
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:11,823
Uh, this one here,
this is my Poppy.

968
00:35:11,825 --> 00:35:13,825
Uh, it's what I got

969
00:35:13,827 --> 00:35:16,794
for writing Conner's famous
catchphrase verse.

970
00:35:16,796 --> 00:35:19,564
If you look close, you'll
notice that it's not real,

971
00:35:19,566 --> 00:35:23,100
because I didn't get a Poppy
or credit of any kind.

972
00:35:23,102 --> 00:35:27,104
But there is one person that
I absolutely have to thank,

973
00:35:27,106 --> 00:35:28,840
and that person is me!

974
00:35:28,842 --> 00:35:30,374
Me, myself and I!

975
00:35:30,376 --> 00:35:31,776
- I did it all by myself!

976
00:35:31,778 --> 00:35:33,544
Nobody helped me!

977
00:35:33,546 --> 00:35:35,446
So...

00:35:35,448 --> 00:35:36,948
Yeah. (sniffs)

979
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,515

00:35:39,985 --> 00:35:41,820
how come he's not
making anything, you know?

982
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:42,986
Nothing's stopping him
from going out

983
00:35:42,988 --> 00:35:44,421
and writing a bunch of hits.

984
00:35:44,423 --> 00:35:47,758
LAWRENCE: After the Style Boyz,
I tried some solo projects,

985
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,126

because, you know, I-I had
different things in my Jeep

997
00:36:10,383 --> 00:36:12,450
than he had in his Jeep.

998
00:36:12,452 --> 00:36:13,885
LAWRENCE: I don't think
Conner's living real life.

999
00:36:13,887 --> 00:36:16,153
I think he's in a bubble
with people

1000
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:17,588
telling him
what he wants to hear

1001
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:19,423
and kissing his ass all day.

1002
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:22,526
I heard he's getting
into stage gimmicks now.

1003
00:36:22,528 --> 00:36:24,461
He's got Owen in a helmet,
looking dumb.

1004
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:26,030
And one where he sings
from a toilet.

1005
00:36:26,032 --> 00:36:27,631
Someone should've told him
that shit's wack,

1006
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,901
but he's so afraid of failure,

1007
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:31,736
man, he's just
getting desperate.

1008
00:36:31,738 --> 00:36:34,539
CONNER:
Let's try it again.

1009
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,874
- (ripping)
- Oh! Oh, it snagged!

1010
00:36:36,876 --> 00:36:38,709
What's up, my confidants?

1011
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:39,711
Be sure to come through

1012
00:36:39,713 --> 00:36:40,879
to my show tonight.

1013
00:36:40,881 --> 00:36:42,579
I'm trying
a brand-new magic trick.

1014
00:36:42,581 --> 00:36:44,448
You know, they said
it couldn't be done,

1015
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,117
that the trick was designed
for a woman,

1016
00:36:46,119 --> 00:36:47,986
and my junk would get
all tangled.

1017
00:36:47,988 --> 00:36:49,586
But I figured out
how to solve it.

1018
00:36:49,588 --> 00:36:50,921
I think if I just
tuck it all back...

1019
00:36:50,923 --> 00:36:52,590
See ya tonight.

1020
00:36:52,592 --> 00:36:53,992
Let's go!

1021
00:36:53,994 --> 00:36:55,626
- (crowd cheering, pop music playing)
- Hey!

1022
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:57,461
What is this, y'all?

1023
00:36:57,463 --> 00:37:00,765
I said upscale.
You took me to outer space.

1024
00:37:00,767 --> 00:37:03,133
(laughs)

1025
00:37:03,135 --> 00:37:05,769
What do you say
we take it back down to Earth?

1026
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:06,873
(whoops)

1027
00:37:08,575 --> 00:37:10,475
What?

1028
00:37:10,477 --> 00:37:11,642
This almost looks like

1029
00:37:11,644 --> 00:37:14,579
something that a cowboy
might wear.

1030
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:15,914
Are y'all looking at my chaps?

1031
00:37:15,916 --> 00:37:17,816
(crowd cheering)

1032
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:21,051
But enough horsing around.
Let's take things uptown.

1033
00:37:21,053 --> 00:37:23,754
How about a good
old-fashioned tuxedo?

1034
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:25,892
There is no substitute.

1035
00:37:27,227 --> 00:37:29,561
Top of the world!

1036
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,095
(crowd groaning, murmuring)

1037
00:37:31,097 --> 00:37:32,930
- Oh, shit.
- GIRL: Where is it?

1038
00:37:32,932 --> 00:37:34,097
CONNER:
No, uh, no.

1039
00:37:34,099 --> 00:37:35,700
It's tucked. I...

1040
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:37,167
I shaved for the trick!

1041
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:38,236
- Don't post those pics!
- NARRATOR: As they approached

1042
00:37:38,238 --> 00:37:40,704
- the edge of the Dark Forest...
- It's an illusion.

1043
00:37:40,706 --> 00:37:41,773
It's tucked, I tuck it back.

1044
00:37:41,775 --> 00:37:43,508
OWEN:
Conner, just hold on.

1045
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,175
CONNER: Don't post those.
It's a tuck-and-tape!

1046
00:37:45,177 --> 00:37:47,178
I don't know what to do
right now.

1047
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,881
I want to show y'all my dick,
but I can't show you my dick!

1048
00:37:49,883 --> 00:37:54,218
It's a great conundrum.
It's a great conundrum!

1049
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,787
Holy shit, dude, where the fuck
was your dick, dawg?

1050
00:37:56,789 --> 00:37:58,122
- What happened out there?!
- (Hunter laughs)

1051
00:37:58,124 --> 00:37:59,791
What happened to the trick?

1052
00:37:59,793 --> 00:38:01,859
Conner, don't worry.
Nobody saw anything.

1053
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:03,660
I wish they had seen something!

1054
00:38:03,662 --> 00:38:05,829
Now there's 10,000 people
that think I got no dick!

1055
00:38:05,831 --> 00:38:07,265
(laughs)

1056
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:09,133
Wait, you guys know
I have a dick, right?

1057
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:11,769
- Yeah. It's just...
- You do. You-you do.

1058
00:38:11,771 --> 00:38:13,537
- Yes.
- I've always believed you had a dick.

1059
00:38:13,539 --> 00:38:15,807
R-Right, right, right,
but, like, where was it though?

1060
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:18,008
Because that motherfucker
was gone.

1061
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,244
We've gone over this. I...

1062
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:20,845
You know I got to tuck
my shit back

1063
00:38:20,847 --> 00:38:22,814
so it doesn't get tangled up
in the garments.

1064
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:24,082
- Yeah, that makes perfect sense.
- Of course.

1065
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:25,883
Got to put it
in between the legs.

1066
00:38:25,885 --> 00:38:26,818
Conner, don't worry about it.

1067
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,253
You were up there
for, like, ten seconds.

1068
00:38:28,255 --> 00:38:30,622
Ten seconds is
an eternity, Harry!

1069
00:38:30,624 --> 00:38:31,923
It's a third
of the way to Mars!

1070
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,624
Conner, we've talked
about this.

1071
00:38:33,626 --> 00:38:35,727
30 Seconds to Mars
is the name of a band.

1072
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:36,928
It's not a fact.

1073
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,229
HUNTER:
Hey, look, thank you, dawg,

1074
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,097
because this shit
was hilarious, fam!

1075
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,767
Well, I'm so glad that I could
entertain you, Hunter.

1076
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:45,537
You wouldn't happen to know
anything about this, would you?

1077
00:38:45,539 --> 00:38:47,037
Ah. (scoffs) I wish.

1078
00:38:47,039 --> 00:38:49,140
(scoffs) This is, like,
genius prank shit right here.

1079
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:50,841
Next level.

1080
00:38:50,843 --> 00:38:54,044
You would have to be
the best prankster of all time

1081
00:38:54,046 --> 00:38:55,747
to think of something
like this.

1082
00:38:55,749 --> 00:38:58,716
And, well, shit, that's...
shit, that's me.

1083
00:38:58,718 --> 00:38:59,753
Maybe I did do it.

1084
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:02,553
Nah, I didn't do it.

1085
00:39:02,555 --> 00:39:04,155
Or did I?

1086
00:39:04,157 --> 00:39:06,291
Nah, I didn't.

1087
00:39:06,293 --> 00:39:08,158
Or maybe I did.

1088
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,294
Not. Do it.

1089
00:39:10,296 --> 00:39:12,030
- Did you?!
- (laughs) I didn't do it.

1090
00:39:12,032 --> 00:39:13,131
Or I did.

1091
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,765
Who knows?! I don't! (laughs)

1092
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:16,166
Conner, don't worry,
don't worry.

1093
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:17,968
This is not news.

1094
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:20,070
- (over TV): Don't post those!
- (laughter)

1095
00:39:20,072 --> 00:39:22,606
What the fuck?!

1096
00:39:22,608 --> 00:39:26,843
The timing of that was crazy!

1097
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,845
- ANNOUNCER: Conner dickless?
- They should call him

1098
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:30,948
NoDick4Real.

1099
00:39:30,950 --> 00:39:33,084
(laughter)

1100
00:39:33,086 --> 00:39:34,255
(slurping)

1101
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:39,226
(hysterical laughter)

1102
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,896
(slurping)

1103
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:49,267
It was tucked, Linda.
It's part of the show.

1104
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,001
- No, no, don't print that!
- CONNER: Everywhere I look.

1105
00:39:51,003 --> 00:39:52,637
This is insane.

1106
00:39:52,639 --> 00:39:54,738
Now it's on the front page
of USA Today,

1107
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,374
the most respected newspaper
in the world?

1108
00:39:56,376 --> 00:39:57,774
Sweetie, relax.

1109
00:39:57,776 --> 00:39:59,811
All we need is
a different story

1110
00:39:59,813 --> 00:40:01,912
- to wipe it out of the press cycle.
- Mm-hmm.

1111
00:40:01,914 --> 00:40:03,914
Okay, so what? What do we do?

1112
00:40:03,916 --> 00:40:05,316
Anything.
Uh, release a new single.

1113
00:40:05,318 --> 00:40:06,883
Get a crazy haircut.

1114
00:40:06,885 --> 00:40:09,954
Or, uh, take an ugly teenager
to the prom.

1115
00:40:09,956 --> 00:40:10,988
All good ideas.

1116
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,390
Let's keep thinking about it.

1117
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:13,925
And I'm gonna go tweet
a picture of my dick.

1118
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:16,095
Okay, don't really do that.

1119
00:40:23,168 --> 00:40:25,903
CONNER: Ah, man,
I just think it's gonna really

1120
00:40:25,905 --> 00:40:27,271
change people's perception
of me

1121
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:29,006
in a good, positive way.

1122
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:31,008
And also, I'm really glad
about the fact

1123
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,778
that we'll get married, too,
'cause I like her so much.

1124
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,745
ASHLEY:
Conner, what's going on?

1125
00:40:34,747 --> 00:40:36,146
- CONNER: You'll see.
- (gentle music playing)

1126
00:40:36,148 --> 00:40:37,381
ASHLEY:
Oh, my God, is that music?

1127
00:40:37,383 --> 00:40:38,783
CONNER:
Yeah.

1128
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:40,218
Almost there. And...

1129
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,120
Uh-huh?

1130
00:40:42,122 --> 00:40:43,724
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

1131
00:40:45,992 --> 00:40:47,358
(gasps)

1132
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,260
ASHLEY:
Are those real wolves?

1133
00:40:49,262 --> 00:40:50,394
CONNER:
Yeah.

1134
00:40:50,396 --> 00:40:51,928
Conner!

1135
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,664
My psychic told me

1136
00:40:53,666 --> 00:40:55,733
that in my previous life,
I was a wolf.

1137
00:40:55,735 --> 00:40:58,169
Which makes so much sense.

1138
00:40:58,171 --> 00:41:00,872
But I can't believe
that Conner remembered.

1139
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:03,274
And you invited the press?
(laughs)

1140
00:41:03,276 --> 00:41:04,675

Why would he do that to Seal?

1194
00:42:52,818 --> 00:42:54,251
- I don't even know...
- Conner4Real is such a joke.

1195

He disappointed all of us.
I mean...

1196
00:42:55,889 --> 00:42:57,320
Did you see that proposal?
It was so fake.

1197
00:42:57,322 --> 00:42:58,890
Like, I don't even think
they like each other.

1198
00:42:58,892 --> 00:42:59,957
Why did they do that to Seal?

1199
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:01,325
He doesn't even have a dick.

1200
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:03,160
I used to like Conner4Real,
but now I wish

1201
00:43:03,162 --> 00:43:04,829
he would just go away.

1202
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:06,296

1203

Conner4Real!

1204
00:43:08,367 --> 00:43:10,401
CONNER: I just want
to thank Seal again

1205
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:11,501
and wish him a fast recovery.

1206
00:43:11,503 --> 00:43:12,970
He's gonna be fine.

1207
00:43:12,972 --> 00:43:14,238
- That's great news.
- (applause)

1208
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,972
That's great news,

1209

- Thank you, thank you.

And, you know, don't forget
CONNquest in stores now.

1211

- Cop that.
- Yeah, absolutely.

1212
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:23,414
Absolutely.

1213
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:25,582
Can I, can I just fanboy out
for a second?

1214
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,984
Uh, because
my-my favorite thing of yours

1215
00:43:27,986 --> 00:43:30,454
- from-from back in the day, the "Donkey Roll."
- Oh.

1216
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:31,955
- You guys know...
- (crowd cheering)

1217
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:34,291
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- For the kids out there,

1218
00:43:34,293 --> 00:43:36,827
The "Donkey Roll" is
from Conner's old group

1219
00:43:36,829 --> 00:43:37,995
the Style Boyz.

1220
00:43:37,997 --> 00:43:40,298
- When I...
- (crowd cheering)

1221
00:43:40,300 --> 00:43:42,332
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying? I don't want to brag,

1222
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:44,968
but I used to do a mean
"Donkey Roll" back in college.

1223
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:47,104
- I'm just saying.
- Oh, for real?

1224
00:43:47,106 --> 00:43:50,341

better than yours.

1225

1226

Kid Contact backstage.

1229

Do you think that we could
get him out here and...?

(crowd cheering)

1231
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:03,354

This business
can be crazy, man.

1285

That's why it's so important

1286
00:45:53,532 --> 00:45:55,131
to be around people
that you trust,

1287
00:45:55,133 --> 00:45:56,367

And plus, Lawrence was always

1290
00:45:59,137 --> 00:46:00,570
the one who could
cheer Conner up.

1291
00:46:00,572 --> 00:46:02,273
You know?

He really needs
his real friends right now.

1295

00:46:12,151 --> 00:46:13,149
Oh, it's just, uh,

1299
00:46:13,151 --> 00:46:14,452
my girlfriend.

1300
00:46:14,454 --> 00:46:16,120
I'm having sex with her.

1301
00:46:16,122 --> 00:46:18,321
All right, man. Uh, maybe.

1302
00:46:18,323 --> 00:46:20,490
You know, maybe.
I'll think about it.

1303
00:46:20,492 --> 00:46:22,459
OWEN: So last night,
I caught a little bit

1304
00:46:22,461 --> 00:46:24,028
of this obscure old movie

1305
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:25,329
called The Parent Trap,
right?

1306
00:46:25,331 --> 00:46:27,664
And in that movie, these two
little redheaded girls,

1307
00:46:27,666 --> 00:46:31,568
they get the idea to trick
their divorced parents

1308
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,771
into falling back in love
with each other.

1309
00:46:33,773 --> 00:46:35,205
So I was like, yo,

1310
00:46:35,207 --> 00:46:37,408
if I just get
Lawrence and Conner

1311
00:46:37,410 --> 00:46:39,410

1312
00:46:39,412 --> 00:46:42,012

In the house. Right?

1365
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:09,693
- Nah. Fuck this.
- No.
- No. No.

1366
00:49:09,695 --> 00:49:10,760
Fans got through the gate.

1367
00:49:10,762 --> 00:49:12,363
- We got to lock up.
- LAWRENCE: Let me out, man.

1368
00:49:12,365 --> 00:49:14,631
Yo, unlock the doors.

1369
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:16,600
Yeah, you should go, man.
Bail... that's your move.

1370
00:49:16,602 --> 00:49:18,903
That's not my move.
That's your move. You bailed.

1371
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:20,937
I didn't bail.
People like me best,

1372
00:49:20,939 --> 00:49:22,705
and you couldn't handle it,
so I did my own thing.

1373
00:49:22,707 --> 00:49:24,707
People like you best
'cause of the shit I wrote.

1374
00:49:24,709 --> 00:49:26,709
They don't like your shit,
they like my shit,

1375
00:49:26,711 --> 00:49:29,280
- and they don't even know it.
- Take a look around, Lawrence.

1376
00:49:29,282 --> 00:49:31,182
If you were so important
to my success,

1377
00:49:31,184 --> 00:49:32,749
how come my solo shit's
way bigger

1378
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:34,184
than Style Boyz ever was?

1379
00:49:34,186 --> 00:49:35,818
You had Owen making
all your beats.

1380
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:38,388
And now you ditched him,
and your shit's tanking.

1381
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:40,256
Why can't you just give me
any credit, man?

1382
00:49:40,258 --> 00:49:41,392
Just admit that I'm talented.

1383
00:49:41,394 --> 00:49:43,861
Why can't you admit that
I wrote the catchphrase verse?

1384
00:49:43,863 --> 00:49:45,930
- Oh, this shit again.
- None of this garbage out here

1385
00:49:45,932 --> 00:49:47,198
- is possible without me.
- GIRL: Conner!

1386
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,133
- Admit that shit.
- I love you!

1387
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:49,867
Man, what the fuck
is going on out there?

1388
00:49:49,869 --> 00:49:51,801
- WOMAN: Conner, sign my tits!
- Oh, what, this?

1389
00:49:51,803 --> 00:49:53,870
This is just some
beautiful-ass titties, man.

1390
00:49:53,872 --> 00:49:56,740
My fans ask me to sign them
all the time,

1391
00:49:56,742 --> 00:49:59,510
because they love me,
and I love them, Lawrence.

1392
00:49:59,512 --> 00:50:01,711
And you know what?
You need to grow up, dude.

1393
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:03,479
Because this right here,

1394
00:50:03,481 --> 00:50:05,716
this is what it's all about,
my friend.

1395
00:50:05,718 --> 00:50:07,450
Making art.

1396
00:50:07,452 --> 00:50:08,718
Connecting with people.

1397
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,254
This is that rock star life,
my man,

1398
00:50:11,256 --> 00:50:13,890
and I'm slurping it down
like a big old

1399
00:50:13,892 --> 00:50:15,825
- fat milkshake.
- Hey, Conner?

1400
00:50:15,827 --> 00:50:18,729
- Not now, Owen! I'm gonna sign these titties.
- I'm just...

1401
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:21,631
So sit back and watch
how it's done, my friend.

1402
00:50:21,633 --> 00:50:24,367
I'm gonna... Oh, shit!
Oh! It's a dick!

1403
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:26,236
That's one of your fans, man.
Go for it.

1404
00:50:26,238 --> 00:50:27,570
- Ooh!
- Can you make it out to Jenna?

1405
00:50:27,572 --> 00:50:28,771
- Oh, hello.
- That's me.

1406
00:50:28,773 --> 00:50:29,872
It's nice to meet you.

1407
00:50:29,874 --> 00:50:31,841
- That's my fiancé's penis.
- Ah.

1408
00:50:31,843 --> 00:50:34,245
- MAN: Big fan.
- Thanks, man. So tight.

1409
00:50:34,247 --> 00:50:35,845
Okay, he's inside.

1410
00:50:35,847 --> 00:50:36,981
I'm just gonna...

1411
00:50:36,983 --> 00:50:38,983
(nervous chuckling)

1412
00:50:38,985 --> 00:50:41,484
...do the old John Hancock.

1413
00:50:41,486 --> 00:50:43,553
Are you guys getting
back together? Style Boyz?

1414
00:50:43,555 --> 00:50:45,823
- No.
- No. Right on.
- We're thinking about it.

1415
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,957
I'm gonna roll
the window up now, so just...

1416
00:50:47,959 --> 00:50:49,026
Thanks for coming by.

1417
00:50:49,028 --> 00:50:51,995
- Great to meet you guys.
- I rest my case, Lawrence.

1418
00:50:51,997 --> 00:50:54,832
You think you know what's up,
but in fact,

1419
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:57,834
you, my friend,
have no idea what's going on.

1420
00:50:57,836 --> 00:50:59,836
Don't call me again.

1421
00:50:59,838 --> 00:51:00,937
Lawrence, dude.

1422
00:51:00,939 --> 00:51:03,774
Don't leave like that.

1423
00:51:03,776 --> 00:51:05,309
Shit.

1424
00:51:05,311 --> 00:51:07,477
We should probably hit
the car wash.

1425
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:08,979

- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. They-they love you.

1435
00:51:26,398 --> 00:51:28,432
Um, they just...

1436
00:51:28,434 --> 00:51:31,001
they just don't have
enough room for you this year.

1437
00:51:31,003 --> 00:51:32,769
What? For real?

1438
00:51:32,771 --> 00:51:34,738
Yeah, it's a bummer. I know.

1439
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:38,341
I told them to keep us in mind
if anything changes.

1440
00:51:38,343 --> 00:51:39,475
It could come around.

1441
00:51:39,477 --> 00:51:41,745
HARRY:
This business is tough.

1442
00:51:41,747 --> 00:51:45,649
The highs are high,
and the lows are low.

1443
00:51:45,651 --> 00:51:47,718
You know? It's like a wave.

1444
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,486
You just got to learn
how to ride the wave, you know?

1445
00:51:50,488 --> 00:51:52,588
It's up and down,
just like that.

1446
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:55,024
Tony! Toni! Toné! TonEe?

1447

1451
00:52:03,035 --> 00:52:06,070

going down again soon.

I'm sure he'll be done soon.

1455
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:13,910

All right, that's it.

1458
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,615
Owen, get your gear.

1459
00:52:19,617 --> 00:52:21,417
- Got it.
- Frank, cue it up.

1460
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:22,919
Conner, what are you doing?

1461
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,454
I'm going on, Harry!

1462
00:52:24,456 --> 00:52:25,722
You better get a bedpan!

- I know.

1482
00:53:16,709 --> 00:53:18,541
- That was a mess out there tonight.
- Yeah.

1483
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:19,776
We have to get rid of Hunter.

1484
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:21,611
We can't fire Hunter, Conner.

1485
00:53:21,613 --> 00:53:23,914
I mean, he's one of the reasons
that the tour sold out.

1486
00:53:23,916 --> 00:53:25,015
I want him off the tour.

1487
00:53:25,017 --> 00:53:28,785
Well, look, he's number one
on BonkoHub right now.

1488
00:53:28,787 --> 00:53:30,019
Well, what number are we?

1489
00:53:30,021 --> 00:53:32,455
Numbers don't matter.
Come on, you know that.

1490
00:53:32,457 --> 00:53:34,091
- God.
- Hey, could we talk about this helmet?

1491
00:53:34,093 --> 00:53:36,959
- It's crazy heavy, and it's really hurting my back.
- Owen,

1492
00:53:36,961 --> 00:53:39,028
why are you talking right now?
Why are you in this meeting?

1493
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,597
I'm in all of our meetings.

1494
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:41,899
Dude, just leave, all right?

1495
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:43,566
Go have a meeting
with Lawrence.

1496
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:44,667
You know, it's not my fault

1497
00:53:44,669 --> 00:53:45,803
that the album's
not selling, okay?

1498
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:46,903
Don't take it out on me.

1499
00:53:46,905 --> 00:53:47,972
Great.

1500
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:51,008
Harry, we have to get rid
of Hunter, all right?

1501
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:52,742
I'm not asking, I'm telling.

1502
00:53:52,744 --> 00:53:54,611
You represent me, not him.

1503
00:53:54,613 --> 00:53:57,747
Okay, look, well, actually...

1504
00:53:57,749 --> 00:53:59,485
technically...

1505
00:54:01,787 --> 00:54:04,454
Full disclosure:
I represent both of you.

1506
00:54:04,456 --> 00:54:06,657
What?

1507
00:54:06,659 --> 00:54:09,026
Yeah.

1508
00:54:09,028 --> 00:54:10,193
You signed him?

1509
00:54:10,195 --> 00:54:11,528
Conner, come on.

1510
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:12,629
Are you kidding me, Harry?

1511
00:54:12,631 --> 00:54:13,830
It's just business.

1512
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:15,198
It's not to me!

1513
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:17,767
All right, look,
decide right now, him or me.

1514
00:54:17,769 --> 00:54:18,869
Come on, don't go there.

1515
00:54:18,871 --> 00:54:20,671
Look, I got a family to feed.

1516
00:54:20,673 --> 00:54:22,071
What? No, you don't!

1517
00:54:22,073 --> 00:54:24,173
- I have a niece.
- We all have a niece!

1518
00:54:24,175 --> 00:54:25,209
You know what?

1519
00:54:25,211 --> 00:54:27,678
(laughs) You're fired.

1520
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,546
Conner, you... you're just...

1521
00:54:29,548 --> 00:54:31,551
you're upset
and you're overreacting.

1522
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,751
Okay, now I got
to collate that.

1523
00:54:34,753 --> 00:54:36,586
Great. Have fun collating.

1524
00:54:36,588 --> 00:54:39,523
There's no fun in collating!

1525
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:41,892
CONNER:
What's up, my confidants?

1526
00:54:41,894 --> 00:54:43,994
Who can you really trust?

1527
00:54:43,996 --> 00:54:45,995
I thought
I could trust my manager,

1528
00:54:45,997 --> 00:54:48,265
but it turned out
he was stabbing me in the back

1529
00:54:48,267 --> 00:54:49,765
the whole time.

1530
00:54:49,767 --> 00:54:52,202
I thought I could trust Seal.

1531
00:54:52,204 --> 00:54:54,537

I probably wouldn't have used

I think this is the day
that my mom gave me Maximus.

1701
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:33,669
Oh.

1702
01:01:33,671 --> 01:01:37,140
This one is from...
Owen and Lawrence!

1703
01:01:37,142 --> 01:01:39,341
- A turtle! A turtle!
- (others gasping)

1704
01:01:39,343 --> 01:01:42,945
- Oh, my goodness!
- Look, Mom! They got me a turtle!

1705
01:01:42,947 --> 01:01:45,148
TILLY:
What do you say, sweetie?

1706
01:01:45,150 --> 01:01:46,515
YOUNG CONNER:
Thank you!

1707
01:01:46,517 --> 01:01:49,019
BOTH:
You're welcome.

1708
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:50,653
TILLY: Honey,
what are you gonna name it?

1709
01:01:50,655 --> 01:01:52,055
I'm gonna name it Maximus.

1710
01:01:52,057 --> 01:01:53,490
PAULA:
Get up. We're going out.

1711
01:01:53,492 --> 01:01:56,325
What?
Oh, no, I'm not going out.

1712
01:01:56,327 --> 01:01:58,662
I cannot deal with the public
right now.

1713
01:01:58,664 --> 01:02:00,095
Conner, it's not a question.

1714
01:02:00,097 --> 01:02:01,430
(sighs)

1715
01:02:01,432 --> 01:02:02,564
(smacks lips)

1716
01:02:02,566 --> 01:02:03,700
All right, fine.

1717
01:02:03,702 --> 01:02:06,236
But if we're going out...

1718
01:02:06,238 --> 01:02:08,070
I got to put on my makeup.

1719
01:02:08,072 --> 01:02:09,138
Please don't put that on.

1720
01:02:09,140 --> 01:02:11,077
(hip-hop music playing)

1721
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,510
This is cool.

1722
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:16,445
Feels good to be out.

1723
01:02:16,447 --> 01:02:18,314
- You were right. Yeah.
- Good.

1724
01:02:18,316 --> 01:02:20,082
I'm glad I did this though.

1725
01:02:20,084 --> 01:02:22,519
You know, it makes me feel
more comfortable, more at ease.

1726
01:02:22,521 --> 01:02:24,120
I feel at ease.

1727
01:02:24,122 --> 01:02:26,222
- Yeah, you look really comfortable.
- Yeah.

1728
01:02:26,224 --> 01:02:28,658
You look like Matthew Modine
had a peanut allergy.

1729
01:02:28,660 --> 01:02:30,260
All right.

1730
01:02:30,262 --> 01:02:31,660
You look like Nazi propaganda.

1731
01:02:31,662 --> 01:02:32,595
Okay, that's foul.

1732

1736
01:03:06,465 --> 01:03:08,700
That piano part is incredible!

1742
01:03:26,751 --> 01:03:31,387
Was my last album bad?

1743
01:03:31,389 --> 01:03:34,124
I feel like I probably could've
handled myself a little better

1744
01:03:34,126 --> 01:03:36,258
over the past few months.

1745
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,329
It feels so nice to be able
to say all this shit,

1746
01:03:39,331 --> 01:03:42,499
'cause the music is so loud
no one can hear me!

1747
01:03:42,501 --> 01:03:45,434
That equal rights song
was offensive!

1748
01:03:45,436 --> 01:03:47,504
I feel free!

1749
01:03:47,506 --> 01:03:49,539
- (whoops)
- (laughs)

1750
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:52,441
- Thanks for coming out, you guys.
- (women laugh)

1751
01:03:52,443 --> 01:03:55,111
- Means a lot.
- Great show, Kid Contact!

1752
01:03:55,113 --> 01:03:56,312
Conner?

1753
01:03:56,314 --> 01:03:57,613
Aw, man!
How'd you recognize me?

1754
01:03:57,615 --> 01:03:59,749
What's up, man?
What are you doing here?

1755
01:03:59,751 --> 01:04:01,517
Had to put on the disguise,
right?

1756
01:04:01,519 --> 01:04:02,486
Yeah, no, I see that.

1757
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:04,320
Come check out
my homie do his thing, man.

1758
01:04:04,322 --> 01:04:05,588
- Great show!
- (chuckles)

1759
01:04:05,590 --> 01:04:07,524
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

1760
01:04:07,526 --> 01:04:08,761
Oh. Paula brought you?

1761
01:04:10,361 --> 01:04:12,227
She did.

1762
01:04:12,229 --> 01:04:13,796
And I'm really glad she did.

1763
01:04:13,798 --> 01:04:16,198
It was such a great show.
You sounded incredible, dude.

1764
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,834
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1765
01:04:18,836 --> 01:04:20,769
I mean, my singing's terrible,
but, you know.

1766
01:04:20,771 --> 01:04:24,207
What? No! No...!

1767
01:04:24,209 --> 01:04:26,508
But, I mean, all right, look,
may be time

1768
01:04:26,510 --> 01:04:28,378
for some vocal lessons,
you know? No shame in that.

1769
01:04:28,380 --> 01:04:30,446
Yeah, or you know
who would sound better on it.

1770
01:04:30,448 --> 01:04:32,215
(smacks lips) Clay Aiken.

1771
01:04:32,217 --> 01:04:33,582
No. You.

1772
01:04:33,584 --> 01:04:35,318
No. No, man. (chuckles)

1773
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:38,555
This is your thing, and
I'm hella proud of you, man.

1774
01:04:38,557 --> 01:04:41,423
(sighs):
And...

1775
01:04:41,425 --> 01:04:43,225
fuck, man, I just...

1776
01:04:43,227 --> 01:04:45,260
- I want to just say I'm sorry.
- Conner, just, I...

1777
01:04:45,262 --> 01:04:47,129
like, I love that
you're doing this right now,

1778
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:48,798
but it's really hard
to take you seriously,

1779
01:04:48,800 --> 01:04:51,568
because you just look like
Jason Segel right now.

1780
01:04:51,570 --> 01:04:52,836
- Oh, Paula said that.
- Well, we have great minds.

1781
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:54,870
- Yeah, that's funny.
- Yeah, it must, like...

1782
01:04:54,872 --> 01:04:56,840
- How is it, like...?
- Oh, yeah, it's, like,

1783
01:04:56,842 --> 01:04:58,207
- the spitting image of, like...
- Is that good? Like...

1784
01:04:58,209 --> 01:05:00,209
Yeah, it looks identical
to that dude.

1785
01:05:00,211 --> 01:05:01,544
Sarah Marshall.

1786
01:05:01,546 --> 01:05:03,178
I need to forget about her.

1787
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:04,613
- Yeah, he needs to forget her.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1788
01:05:04,615 --> 01:05:06,115
- Love that movie.
- Yeah.

1789
01:05:06,117 --> 01:05:07,617
Thanks, man.

1790
01:05:07,619 --> 01:05:09,718
It means a lot
that you came out.

1791
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:12,222
I'm glad I came, too. For real.

1792
01:05:12,224 --> 01:05:13,793
That's good, man.

1793
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,497
(birds chirping)

1794
01:05:21,198 --> 01:05:22,367
(exhales sharply)

1795
01:05:23,468 --> 01:05:24,770
Nice.

1796
01:05:27,238 --> 01:05:29,175
What the fuck?

1797
01:05:31,376 --> 01:05:33,646
One of you guys put this here?

1798
01:05:37,648 --> 01:05:39,451
(wind whistling softly)

1799
01:05:43,387 --> 01:05:44,887
Hey, Lawrence.

1800
01:05:44,889 --> 01:05:46,923
Conner.

1801
01:05:46,925 --> 01:05:48,457
Owen.

1802
01:05:48,459 --> 01:05:50,760
Lawrence.

1803
01:05:50,762 --> 01:05:52,861
Conner.

1804
01:05:52,863 --> 01:05:54,564
Just... (grunts)

1805
01:05:54,566 --> 01:05:56,932
That's for you, man.

1806
01:05:56,934 --> 01:05:58,501
To borrow, you know?

1807
01:05:58,503 --> 01:06:00,202
Figured...

1808
01:06:00,204 --> 01:06:02,372
you could take a bunch of pics
of you holding it and stuff,

1809
01:06:02,374 --> 01:06:03,673
you could post them
or whatever.

1810
01:06:03,675 --> 01:06:05,510
All right? So...

1811
01:06:06,778 --> 01:06:08,680
...now we're cool.

1812
01:06:12,617 --> 01:06:13,883
(rustling)

1813
01:06:13,885 --> 01:06:14,883
Lawrence!

1814
01:06:14,885 --> 01:06:16,385
What the fuck, man?

1815
01:06:16,387 --> 01:06:18,187
Now I got to go find that!

1816
01:06:18,189 --> 01:06:20,323
What do you want me to say?

1817
01:06:20,325 --> 01:06:21,925
That you helped
with the catchphrase verse?

1818
01:06:21,927 --> 01:06:23,760
Is that what this is
still about?

1819
01:06:23,762 --> 01:06:26,829
Fine. You helped with the
catchphrase verse. All right?

1820
01:06:26,831 --> 01:06:28,765
You happy?

1821
01:06:28,767 --> 01:06:32,734
All right,
and you wrote most of it.

1822
01:06:32,736 --> 01:06:34,673
But using my catchphrases.

1823
01:06:35,907 --> 01:06:38,177
That you also cowrote.

1824
01:06:39,376 --> 01:06:40,510
All right, wrote.

1825
01:06:40,512 --> 01:06:41,878
But we were both in the room,

1826
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:44,981
and I dictated
all the best stuff.

1827
01:06:44,983 --> 01:06:46,883
All right,
none of the best stuff, dude,

1828
01:06:46,885 --> 01:06:48,751
but I had tons of great ideas

1829
01:06:48,753 --> 01:06:50,823
that I still don't even know
why you didn't use them.

1830
01:06:51,923 --> 01:06:53,789
Because they sucked!

1831
01:06:53,791 --> 01:06:55,691
Okay, fine. That's my bad.

1832
01:06:55,693 --> 01:06:57,626
But I was there
the whole time, man.

1833
01:06:57,628 --> 01:07:00,495
I was a little late.
I was a little late that day.

1834
01:07:00,497 --> 01:07:02,966
There was traffic,
and I was a little tardy

1835
01:07:02,968 --> 01:07:04,499
on that particular day.

1836
01:07:04,501 --> 01:07:05,968
There was no traffic.
I lied about that.

1837
01:07:05,970 --> 01:07:09,638
I lied about it because
I overslept on accident.

1838
01:07:09,640 --> 01:07:11,874
It was on purpose.
It was a power move.

1839
01:07:11,876 --> 01:07:14,544
I was trying to send a message,
and that was

1840
01:07:14,546 --> 01:07:16,512
a dick move on my part,
all right?

1841
01:07:16,514 --> 01:07:19,249
However, once I got there...
late...

1842
01:07:19,251 --> 01:07:20,983
I put in time, okay?

1843
01:07:20,985 --> 01:07:23,519
I left a little early,
I remember that.

1844
01:07:23,521 --> 01:07:25,655
I was never there.
Now I remember.

1845
01:07:25,657 --> 01:07:28,390
I remember now what happened!

1846
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:30,727
I bailed, and you wrote
the whole verse.

1847
01:07:30,729 --> 01:07:32,762
You wrote it,
and I never gave you credit.

1848
01:07:32,764 --> 01:07:34,263
'Cause guess why.

1849
01:07:34,265 --> 01:07:35,597
No one cares who writes shit.

1850
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:37,367
They just care who performs it.

1851
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:40,470
In fact, I think the only
person in the whole universe

1852
01:07:40,472 --> 01:07:44,740
who cares about the credit
for who wrote it is you!

1853
01:07:44,742 --> 01:07:45,878
(sighs)

1854
01:07:51,548 --> 01:07:53,916
(quietly):
Fuck.

1855
01:07:53,918 --> 01:07:55,421
(clears throat)

1856
01:07:57,488 --> 01:07:59,691
I'm sorry.

1857
01:08:14,072 --> 01:08:16,338
Boom.

1858

you grew here again?

01:08:27,852 --> 01:08:29,851
Oh, shit!

1863
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,454
Lawrence,
how much weed do you have?

1864
01:08:32,456 --> 01:08:34,856
Hey, everyone, I'm gonna take
the rest of the day off

Pretty fun in there, man.

1912

I forgot how fun it is.

1913
01:10:12,924 --> 01:10:14,457
Kind of makes me think

1914
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:16,057
that I fucking hate farming.

1915
01:10:16,059 --> 01:10:17,325
I look at Conner,
and I see that

1916
01:10:17,327 --> 01:10:19,995
seven-year-old scrub
that I grew up with, and...

1917
01:10:19,997 --> 01:10:22,931
it's like, how could you
be mad at a seven-year-old?

1918
01:10:22,933 --> 01:10:26,135
It's crazy I spent so much time
thinking about killing him.

(gags) Oh, fuck!

1923
01:10:34,478 --> 01:10:37,145
Conner's full of surprises
these days, man.

1924
01:10:37,147 --> 01:10:38,948
I mean,
on our way from the airport,

1925
01:10:38,950 --> 01:10:40,949
I actually noticed
something crazy.

1926
01:10:40,951 --> 01:10:43,118
I looked down, and in his bag
he had this book

1927
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:45,620
called
How to Be a Better Friend.

1928
01:10:45,622 --> 01:10:47,590
It was all dog-eared
and scribbled on.

1929
01:10:47,592 --> 01:10:49,025
It feels like
he's really trying.

1930
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:50,993
And plus, it shows
he knows how to read,

1931
01:10:50,995 --> 01:10:52,561
which is really heartening.

1932
01:10:52,563 --> 01:10:54,497
- (whoops)
- I can't believe we remembered that, man.

1933
01:10:54,499 --> 01:10:56,231
Paula's calling you.

1934
01:10:56,233 --> 01:10:58,167
Yo, there was
a whole second verse

1935
01:10:58,169 --> 01:10:59,802
- in that, too, remember that?
- Yeah, what was it, dude?

1936
01:10:59,804 --> 01:11:01,102
- I'm gonna grab it, I'm gonna grab it.
- Okay.

1937
01:11:01,104 --> 01:11:02,904
- You remember that?
- Yeah.
- (Conner sighs)

1938
01:11:02,906 --> 01:11:04,172
Yo.

1939
01:11:04,174 --> 01:11:05,807
PAULA:
Where the hell have you been?

1940
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:07,642
Um, hanging with the guys.

1941
01:11:07,644 --> 01:11:09,846
It's actually been
super fun, man.

1942
01:11:09,848 --> 01:11:12,748
Conner, you just got offered
the Poppy Awards.

1943
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:14,883
Wait, what?

1945

- What did Paula want, man?

1961
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:49,752
Oh, nothing. They wanted me
to do the Pop Awards,

1962
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:51,020
but I passed on it.

1963
01:11:51,022 --> 01:11:53,021
- Yo, what?
- Dude, I don't want

1964
01:11:53,023 --> 01:11:55,291
to do that shit.
I'm hanging with you guys.

1965
01:11:55,293 --> 01:11:57,092
Who fucking cares, dude?
That's the Poppies.

1966
01:11:57,094 --> 01:11:59,060
All right, but I thought
this was, like,

1967
01:11:59,062 --> 01:12:01,696
the whole reason
you guys were mad at me,

1968
01:12:01,698 --> 01:12:03,932
for going and doing
all this solo shit.

1969
01:12:03,934 --> 01:12:06,769
Dude, you don't have to choose
between us and your solo shit.

1970
01:12:06,771 --> 01:12:08,538
It's like with Wu-Tang Clan.
It's like,

1971
01:12:08,540 --> 01:12:10,907
you're Method Man,
and he made a solo record,

1972
01:12:10,909 --> 01:12:12,842
but he's still
in the Wu-Tang Clan.

1973
01:12:12,844 --> 01:12:14,976
He never stopped
being in the Wu-Tang Clan.

1974
01:12:14,978 --> 01:12:17,279
- Right.
- Or, like, the GZA.

1975
01:12:17,281 --> 01:12:20,216
He was in the Wu-Tang Clan,
and then he made a solo record.

1976
01:12:20,218 --> 01:12:22,284
He never stopped being
in the Wu-Tang Clan.

1977
01:12:22,286 --> 01:12:24,086
OWEN:
Yeah. Or you're the RZA,

1978
01:12:24,088 --> 01:12:26,122
and you could do
your solo shit,

1979
01:12:26,124 --> 01:12:28,557
but you're still
in the Wu-Tang Clan.

1980
01:12:28,559 --> 01:12:30,059
So basically...

1981
01:12:30,061 --> 01:12:31,726
we're the Wu-Tang Clan.

1982
01:12:31,728 --> 01:12:33,729
Exactly. But better.

1983
01:12:33,731 --> 01:12:35,998
Yeah. Well...

1984
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:38,133
As soon as I said it, I was
kind of like, uh, maybe not.

1985

- or Style Boyz?
- Uh...

2104
01:16:27,564 --> 01:16:29,097
Yeah, no, I asked him.

2105
01:16:29,099 --> 01:16:31,400
He's just kind of, like,
looking off into space

2106
01:16:31,402 --> 01:16:34,235
and, like, really making a meal
out of this.

2107
01:16:34,237 --> 01:16:36,305
And now I'm just
standing here waiting.

2108
01:16:36,307 --> 01:16:38,073
He's looking off to,
like, contemplate

2109
01:16:38,075 --> 01:16:39,809
whether he should, I think,

2110
01:16:39,811 --> 01:16:41,276
pick the Style Boyz,
'cause he's, like,

2111
01:16:41,278 --> 01:16:43,011
looking in their direction.

2112
01:16:43,013 --> 01:16:46,015
So he might be leaning
toward that kind of choi...

2113
01:16:46,017 --> 01:16:47,583
No, he's looking back.

2114
01:16:47,585 --> 01:16:50,252
So I-I'm lost. I'm not sure
which one he's gonna go for.

All right.
I know what I'm gonna do.

the "Donkey Roll"

When I walked out onstage,

2233
01:21:21,357 --> 01:21:22,591
all I could think of was,

2234
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:24,325
I'm so happy.

2235
01:21:24,327 --> 01:21:28,596
And I really hope that
Tony! Toni! Toné! is watching.

2236
01:21:28,598 --> 01:21:30,599

2237
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:32,434
CONNER:
A wise man once said,

2238
01:21:32,436 --> 01:21:35,236
"Everyone's career
is on a wave.

2239
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:39,440
"Sometimes you're up,
sometimes you're down.

2240
01:21:39,442 --> 01:21:42,310
"But the trick is not to
lose yourself along the way.

2241
01:21:42,312 --> 01:21:44,779
And when you're up,
don't be an asshole about it."

2242
01:21:44,781 --> 01:21:46,815
It's like my mom always says...

2243
01:21:46,817 --> 01:21:48,816
(laughs):
Yo, what the fuck?

2244
01:21:48,818 --> 01:21:52,788
That stage manager lady just
macked on Lawrence super hard.

2245
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:54,623
Yo, do they even
know each other?

2246
01:21:54,625 --> 01:21:56,124
(laughs):
Oh, my God!

2247
01:21:56,126 --> 01:21:57,825
And why is De-bor-ah here?

2248
01:21:57,827 --> 01:21:59,861
Anyways, be cool
to your friends, right?

2249
01:21:59,863 --> 01:22:01,430
That's what I was saying?

2250
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:02,597
Yo, they are gonna fuck!

2251
01:22:02,599 --> 01:22:03,666
Damn that is hilarious.

2252
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:07,235

be a good person,
