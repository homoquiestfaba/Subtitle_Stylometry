You've gotta put yourself in it.

Bend over, lift the breast,
then drop it back into the cup.

00:18:05,094 --> 00:18:07,399
running down
Wilshire Boulevard.

351
00:18:07,431 --> 00:18:09,133
She's a little shaken up.

352
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,935
Found these on her.

353
00:18:15,472 --> 00:18:16,607
Clear, please.

354
00:18:22,947 --> 00:18:25,552
MURRAY: Oh, Jesus Christ.

355
00:18:32,089 --> 00:18:34,360
Here. Put this on.

356
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:43,669
You scared your father
half to death.

357
00:18:43,701 --> 00:18:45,438
You know that, don't you?

358
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,510
He's worried sick about you,
and he's not 1000/o to begin with.

359
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:51,278
RITA: I'm a grownup.
I have it all under control.

360
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:55,982
Look.

361
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:58,617
lt fits.

362
00:18:58,651 --> 00:18:59,819
MURRAY: Great.

363
00:18:59,852 --> 00:19:01,488
RITA: Can I have a puff?

364
00:19:03,455 --> 00:19:06,327
MURRAY: I'm gonna have
to call him up, you know.

365
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:11,033
RITA: Remember you'd sneak me
puffs when Poppy wasn't looking?

366
00:19:11,064 --> 00:19:13,034
lt was always us against him.

367
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:14,836
Two against one.

368
00:19:15,902 --> 00:19:18,239
MURRAY: I'm still gonna
have to make the call.

369
00:19:19,506 --> 00:19:20,774
RITA: You know what
he says about you?

370
00:19:20,807 --> 00:19:22,377
-He calls you a bum.
-l heard.

371
00:19:22,409 --> 00:19:23,544
RITA: "My brother the bum.

372
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:25,880
"The one thing my daughter
and brother have in common:

373
00:19:25,912 --> 00:19:27,749
"no respect for money."

374
00:19:29,249 --> 00:19:31,052
We're the family fuckups.

375
00:19:31,085 --> 00:19:33,055
MURRAY:
What kind of talk is that?

376
00:19:33,087 --> 00:19:35,057
No wonder your father
got the cancer.

377
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:37,393
RITA: That's not my fault.
I didn't cause cancer.

378
00:19:37,424 --> 00:19:39,562
MURRAY: This routine of yours
isn't so cute anymore.

379
00:19:39,593 --> 00:19:40,728
RITA: What routine?

380
00:19:40,761 --> 00:19:42,498
MURRAY: Running around
hopped up on dope!

381
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,999
RITA: I'm not on dope.

382
00:19:44,031 --> 00:19:47,071
MURRAY: What the hell is this,
then, Chiclets?

383
00:19:47,601 --> 00:19:49,171
[Rita laughs]

384
00:19:49,203 --> 00:19:50,672
MURRAY: It's not funny.

385
00:19:50,705 --> 00:19:52,575
You know you're scaring me?

386
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:55,478
You're 29 years old, girl.
It's not cute anymore.

387
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:57,647
I gotta call him up.

388
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,348
Uncle Murray!

389
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:02,586
Wait, wait!

390
00:20:02,617 --> 00:20:04,520
Murray!

391
00:20:04,553 --> 00:20:07,225
I'm not high. I'm bloated.

392
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:10,527
They're not narcotics,
they're diuretics.

393
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,761
They make you pee.

394
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,863
MURRAY: Get in the car.

395
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:16,000
Why doesn't anyone
ever believe me?

396
00:20:17,366 --> 00:20:19,570
They're for bloat, that's all.

397
00:20:19,601 --> 00:20:21,772
To lose weight.

398
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:25,143
I thought you'd be
on my side, not his.

399
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,111
I can't go back home.

400
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,481
Rita, your place
is with your family.

401
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:30,947
You're family.

402
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,618
MURRAY: Here, blow your nose.

403
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,953
I would love to have you.

404
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:38,190
Vivian could use a woman around.

405
00:20:38,221 --> 00:20:40,558
But I got enough mouths
to feed as it is now.

406
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:42,962
RITA: Maybe Poppy would--

407
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,567
No. He can be a tight bastard
when he wants to be.

408
00:20:46,597 --> 00:20:49,335
What's he gonna do,
say no to his own daughter?

409
00:20:50,901 --> 00:20:53,740
lt's cheaper than Pinewood.

410
00:20:53,771 --> 00:20:55,441
Please?

411
00:20:57,808 --> 00:20:59,077
Hmm.

412
00:20:59,177 --> 00:21:00,746
ELIOT: So, where's your mom?

413
00:21:00,778 --> 00:21:04,352
She's back east.
They're divorced.

414
00:21:04,381 --> 00:21:08,088
Usually kids go with the mom
after a divorce.

415
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,755
VIVIAN: So? Big deal.

416
00:21:09,788 --> 00:21:12,593
Must be hard for a girl
without a mom.

417
00:21:12,624 --> 00:21:14,828
Do you work for welfare
or something?

418
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,596
I was just asking.

419
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:21,368
Are you staring at my breasts?

420
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:22,968
No.

421
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,012
Well, look at them.

422
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:32,412
OK.

423
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,585
What do they make you think?

424
00:21:36,615 --> 00:21:37,883
ELIOT: I don't--

425
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,954
I don't know.

426
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:43,390
Do you think
they look deformed?

427
00:21:45,691 --> 00:21:47,494
I think they look beautiful.

428
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:50,263
Do you want to touch them?

429
00:21:51,664 --> 00:21:52,800
OK.

430
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,570
OK, let's go.

431
00:22:11,771 --> 00:22:13,241
What are you doing?

432
00:22:14,909 --> 00:22:17,213
Taking off my pants.

433
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:19,917
I'm not gonna do it
in the laundry room.

434
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:21,482
I wasn't talking about that.

435
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:24,454
Just breasts. Second base.
That's it. Not all the way.

436
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:27,390
ELIOT: I'm sorry.
Can I take off my shirt?

437
00:22:27,421 --> 00:22:29,291
VIVIAN: OK. Do it quick.

438
00:22:29,323 --> 00:22:31,293
You got hair.

439
00:22:33,027 --> 00:22:34,930
I got body odor, too.

440
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,763
MURRAY: If this is gonna work,
we gotta have a deal.

441
00:23:04,794 --> 00:23:08,033
Your father won't support this
unless we have a plan...

442
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:10,101
and I don't mean hanging
around California...

443
00:23:10,133 --> 00:23:12,538
and getting a suntan,
if you know what I mean.

444
00:23:12,568 --> 00:23:15,774
We gotta figure out something
you can do to further yourself.

445
00:23:15,805 --> 00:23:17,942
Some kind of schooling
for your future.

446
00:23:17,974 --> 00:23:19,377
Something legitimate.

447
00:23:20,843 --> 00:23:25,920
So is there anything
you're interested in doing...

448
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:27,452
with your life--

449
00:23:27,483 --> 00:23:30,690
Off the top of your head.

450
00:23:30,721 --> 00:23:32,223
Can you do hair?

451
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:34,928
Do you type?

452
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:37,229
Typing's a great skill to have.

453
00:23:37,261 --> 00:23:40,434
lt gets a girl through.
It saves women's lives.

454
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:44,138
There's got to be something
you're interested in. Anything!

455
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:47,041
I really never thought
about it before.

456
00:23:55,046 --> 00:23:57,316
MURRAY: How about a nurse?

457
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,319
She's given it
a lot of thought, Mickey.

458
00:23:59,351 --> 00:24:00,854
She wants to be a nurse.

459
00:24:01,853 --> 00:24:04,291
She says it's something
she's always dreamed of.

460
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:08,596
I don't know.
I think it's a good idea.

461
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:12,333
It'll give her a fresh start,
and I can keep an eye on her.

462
00:24:12,365 --> 00:24:13,935
I can't do it alone,
though, Mickey.

463
00:24:13,966 --> 00:24:15,969
I'm gonna need help,
and it's not gonna be cheap.

464
00:24:16,002 --> 00:24:18,674
You're gonna have to kick in,
Mickey...

465
00:24:18,704 --> 00:24:20,106
on a monthly.

466
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,377
Yeah, yeah. Here she is.

467
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:26,747
Hi, Poppy.

468
00:24:28,014 --> 00:24:29,417
Yeah.

469
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,618
A nurse.

471
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,865
OK, time's up. Let's go.

472
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:45,267
Watch it. You're gonna
stretch out my sweater.

473
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:46,467
ELIOT: Take it off.

474
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,871
lt's not even mine, all right?
It's Kelly's.

475
00:24:48,902 --> 00:24:51,139
lt's stretched all out of shape.

476
00:24:51,171 --> 00:24:53,074
She's gonna kill me.

477
00:24:53,106 --> 00:24:54,476
Where's my bra?

478
00:25:04,786 --> 00:25:06,589
You OK?

479
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:10,627
Don't tell anybody
about this, OK?

480
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:14,096
lt's just a building thing.

481
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:15,965
I don't want it to get around.

Viv, I haven't seen anything
like you in a long time.

No. We're staying here

-Yeah.

Make it up to her.

01:15:52,372 --> 01:15:54,542
I saw you last night.

1577
01:15:57,810 --> 01:15:59,146
Yep.

1578
01:16:01,381 --> 01:16:03,384
I hoped it was the wind.

1579
01:16:03,416 --> 01:16:05,686
l--l don't need you.
I don't need...

1580
01:16:06,953 --> 01:16:09,524
your stupid shoes
or your clothes.

1581
01:16:09,556 --> 01:16:12,529
I don't need anything
from you...

1582
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:13,795
or anybody.

1583
01:16:13,827 --> 01:16:15,463
Don't come near me.

1584
01:16:15,496 --> 01:16:17,366
The whole family is sick.

1585
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,201
I hate us. We're freaks.

1586
01:16:19,233 --> 01:16:20,468
We're not freaks.

1587
01:16:20,501 --> 01:16:22,471
-Oh, we're not?
-No.

1588
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:25,242
Well, what then?

1589
01:16:27,074 --> 01:16:29,578
Sometimes what, Rita?

1590
01:16:51,967 --> 01:16:54,237
I'm sorry you had to see it.

1591
01:17:08,718 --> 01:17:10,555
Change what?

1592
01:17:12,588 --> 01:17:14,191
My breasts.

1593
01:17:14,223 --> 01:17:16,226
Who did that?

1594
01:17:17,860 --> 01:17:19,629
Then I looked at them...

1595
01:17:19,663 --> 01:17:20,965
I looked at myself
in the mirror...

1596
01:17:20,997 --> 01:17:23,101
and I thought...

1597
01:17:23,132 --> 01:17:24,735
that's Mom there.

1598
01:17:24,767 --> 01:17:27,739
You saw your mom in your breast?

1599
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:36,182
You have your father's nose.

1600
01:17:36,213 --> 01:17:37,481
lt's cute.

1601
01:17:37,514 --> 01:17:38,682
[Laughs]

1602
01:17:41,385 --> 01:17:43,322
Viv, I'm sorry.

1603
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:56,101
Yeah.

1604
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:07,515
Come on. Let's go.

1605
01:18:07,545 --> 01:18:09,515
This stupid hat.

1606
01:18:10,949 --> 01:18:12,051
MICKEY:
Bumping and bumping.

1607
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:14,755
She's sitting there
like nothing's happening.

1608
01:18:14,787 --> 01:18:16,557
I should take you
on a roller coaster.

1609
01:18:16,589 --> 01:18:18,559
BELLE: Mickey, honey, look.
Look. Oh.

1610
01:18:18,591 --> 01:18:20,828
MICKEY: Oh, look at that.
There she is.

1611
01:18:20,859 --> 01:18:22,028
My little girl.

1612
01:18:23,295 --> 01:18:26,501
Oh, I'm so proud of you, honey.

1613
01:18:26,532 --> 01:18:28,669
BELLE:
Still with the cigarettes, huh?

1614
01:18:28,701 --> 01:18:30,304
They're lights.

1615
01:18:30,336 --> 01:18:31,438
BELLE: And a nurse.

1616
01:18:31,470 --> 01:18:33,473
Not a nurse, Ma.
A nurse's aide.

1617
01:18:33,506 --> 01:18:36,378
Either way, in all that white,
you shouldn't have cigarettes.

1618
01:18:36,409 --> 01:18:38,479
You're supposed to be
promoting health.

1619
01:18:38,512 --> 01:18:40,515
-Belle!
-What? It's true.

1620
01:18:40,547 --> 01:18:41,849
You're too hard on her already.

1621
01:18:41,881 --> 01:18:43,049
Mickey, you know what?

1622
01:18:43,082 --> 01:18:45,320
You spoil her,
and that's not right.

1623
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:46,721
We got cancer in the family.

1624
01:18:46,753 --> 01:18:50,026
So, uh, what are you learning
at Byman's?

1625
01:18:50,056 --> 01:18:52,728
Well, Dad,
it's only been one day.

1626
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,329
She's doing great, Mick.

1627
01:18:54,361 --> 01:18:57,333
For all the money I pay them,
she should be an MD by now.

1628
01:18:57,364 --> 01:19:00,269
So, what'd they teach you there
on the first day?

1629
01:19:00,300 --> 01:19:04,375
Um...we did urine.

1630
01:19:04,405 --> 01:19:06,609
Piss?

1631
01:19:06,641 --> 01:19:08,578
All day? That's it?

1632
01:19:08,609 --> 01:19:11,014
And...

1633
01:19:11,045 --> 01:19:13,549
-wrists.
-What?

1634
01:19:13,581 --> 01:19:14,884
WAITRESS: Who wants coffee?

1635
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:17,220
Just pour, sweetheart.
We're dying here.

1636
01:19:17,251 --> 01:19:18,754
You're learning about wrists?

1637
01:19:20,589 --> 01:19:22,726
RITA: Pulse. How to take
someone's pulse.

1638
01:19:22,758 --> 01:19:24,260
That's great, honey.

1639
01:19:24,292 --> 01:19:25,595
isn't that something, Mick?

1640
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:30,000
-Take my pulse.
-What?

1641
01:19:30,031 --> 01:19:31,401
Come on, take my pulse.

1642
01:19:31,433 --> 01:19:33,737
I want to see what my little
girl's learning over there.

1643
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:35,172
She doesn't have a watch.

1644
01:19:35,204 --> 01:19:36,606
You need a watch to do it.

1645
01:19:36,638 --> 01:19:38,575
Here. Take mine.

1646
01:19:38,607 --> 01:19:40,043
RITA: Dad.

1647
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:42,713
Cartier. That's an excellent
timepiece, Uncle Mickey.

1648
01:19:42,745 --> 01:19:43,713
lt's excellent.

1649
01:19:43,746 --> 01:19:45,448
Take my pulse.
Come on, it'll be fun.

1650
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,885
OK. You ready?

1651
01:19:47,916 --> 01:19:51,490
Ready? Shouldn't I be
pulsing automatically?

1652
01:19:52,921 --> 01:19:54,357
What the hell are you doing?

1653
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,592
I'm looking, Dad.

1654
01:19:55,625 --> 01:19:58,030
You have to look that hard,
I can't be doing too good.

1655
01:19:58,061 --> 01:20:02,402
ls there a doctor in the house?
We got a dead man in this booth.

1656
01:20:04,567 --> 01:20:06,270
Dead.

1657
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:07,537
Get one off once in a while.

1658
01:20:07,571 --> 01:20:08,706
BEN: Good one.

1659
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:10,542
Yeah, you're a riot,
Uncle Mickey.

1660
01:20:10,574 --> 01:20:11,742
Come on, let me--

1661
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,077
[Vivian coughing]

1662
01:20:13,109 --> 01:20:15,447
BELLE:
Oh, honey, are you all right?

1663
01:20:15,479 --> 01:20:16,647
Oh, Viv.

1664
01:20:18,182 --> 01:20:19,517
BELLE:
This girl needs some water.

1665
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:21,553
Somebody get some water!

1666
01:20:21,585 --> 01:20:23,655
MURRAY: Can we get water?
Can't you see the kid's choking?

1667
01:20:25,589 --> 01:20:26,724
MICKEY: What is that?

1668
01:20:26,758 --> 01:20:29,562
Must've swallowed a hairball
from all that hair in her face.

1669
01:20:29,593 --> 01:20:30,896
BELLE: Shh. Stop it.

1670
01:20:33,598 --> 01:20:35,835
WAITRESS:
Can I take your order?

1671
01:20:37,335 --> 01:20:39,171
MICKEY: Yeah, yeah,
we'll order something.

1672
01:20:40,772 --> 01:20:42,242
OK.

1673
01:20:48,546 --> 01:20:50,884
Uh, can we get the check?

1674
01:20:50,917 --> 01:20:53,454
BELLE: And I'd like
a little more water, please.

1675
01:20:53,485 --> 01:20:55,422
lt was very salty.

1676
01:20:55,453 --> 01:20:57,423
MICKEY: So how's
the new apartment working out?

1677
01:20:57,455 --> 01:20:59,726
Oh, it's beautiful.
You gotta come see it.

1678
01:20:59,759 --> 01:21:02,264
lt's really nice, Uncle Mickey.
We love it.

1679
01:21:02,295 --> 01:21:05,434
Mickey,
you didn't forget the monthly?

1680
01:21:05,464 --> 01:21:07,534
I already sent you
for this month.

1681
01:21:07,566 --> 01:21:10,138
What are you doing,
blowing my money at the track?

1682
01:21:10,169 --> 01:21:11,771
No. That was for last month.

1683
01:21:11,804 --> 01:21:13,073
Tomorrow's the first again.

1684
01:21:13,105 --> 01:21:16,578
How many times I gotta tell you?
You gotta learn to budget.

1685
01:21:16,609 --> 01:21:18,012
You're a 65-year-old man.

1686
01:21:18,044 --> 01:21:21,283
Map it out so you don't run out
the end of evey month.

1687
01:21:21,314 --> 01:21:22,984
No, that's not it.
l--l need it.

1688
01:21:23,015 --> 01:21:24,083
lt's been tight.

1689
01:21:24,116 --> 01:21:26,821
Going off my shift,
so if you don't mind...

1690
01:21:26,853 --> 01:21:29,158
-I'll take care of it.
-l got it.

1691
01:21:29,189 --> 01:21:30,991
-Give me the check.
-lt's on me.

1692
01:21:31,023 --> 01:21:32,192
What are you doing?

1693
01:21:32,225 --> 01:21:33,894
I'm paying for breakfast.

1694
01:21:33,928 --> 01:21:35,898
You acting the big shot?

1695
01:21:35,930 --> 01:21:38,869
Let me just pay for breakfast
in front of my kids.

1696
01:21:38,900 --> 01:21:41,104
You haven't paid for anything
your whole goddamn life.

1697
01:21:41,803 --> 01:21:44,909
BELLE: Mickey, sweetheart,
stop it. Let him pay.

1698
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:47,009
-Belle, it's the principle.
-l know.

1699
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:48,810
If  he pays the check,
it's still me.

1700
01:21:48,843 --> 01:21:50,011
Let's not play games.

1701
01:21:50,043 --> 01:21:50,043
If  you pay or I pay,
I'm still paying, right?

1702
01:21:50,066 --> 01:21:52,971
I've been paying for you
for 50 years, Murray.

1703
01:21:55,688 --> 01:21:57,058
Not in front of the kids, Mick.

1704
01:21:57,089 --> 01:21:58,691
You think
they're mental midgets?

1705
01:21:58,724 --> 01:22:00,627
You're not fooling anybody.

1706
01:22:00,659 --> 01:22:02,529
Ask your daughter
who pays the bills...

1707
01:22:02,561 --> 01:22:04,464
who bought the clothes
on her back...

1708
01:22:04,497 --> 01:22:06,000
the shoes on her feet.

1709
01:22:06,032 --> 01:22:08,570
I'll tell you what.
I'll take care of the check.

1710
01:22:08,602 --> 01:22:09,804
Where's the girl? Miss!

1711
01:22:09,836 --> 01:22:12,140
Belle, put your money away.
He needs to hear this.

1712
01:22:12,171 --> 01:22:15,043
Who's keeping your kids
in Beverly Hills? Who, you?

1713
01:22:15,074 --> 01:22:16,210
Come on.

1714
01:22:16,243 --> 01:22:18,045
They're not stupid, Murray.
They know.

1715
01:22:18,078 --> 01:22:21,117
The money in your pocket comes
from my goddamn bank account.

1716
01:22:21,148 --> 01:22:23,151
Let's put our cards
on the table.

1717
01:22:23,183 --> 01:22:25,520
Let 'em know
who their real father is.

1718
01:22:25,552 --> 01:22:27,022
I'm their father.

1719
01:22:27,054 --> 01:22:29,091
I'm supporting your
fucking family their whole life!

1720
01:22:29,122 --> 01:22:30,892
What are you doing?!

1721
01:22:31,893 --> 01:22:33,295
Aah!

1722
01:22:33,326 --> 01:22:35,063
BELLE: Oh, God.

1723
01:22:35,095 --> 01:22:37,633
[Gasping]
She--she--she--

1724
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:40,437
Poppy...

1725
01:22:40,468 --> 01:22:42,972
I'm pregnant.

1726
01:22:43,004 --> 01:22:45,642
Takes a fork
and stabs me in the leg.

1727
01:22:45,673 --> 01:22:46,942
BELLE:
I know, darling. I know.

1728
01:22:46,975 --> 01:22:48,243
That's the thanks I get.

1729
01:22:48,276 --> 01:22:49,411
Please!

1730
01:22:49,443 --> 01:22:51,246
Can you give us a ride?!

1731
01:22:51,279 --> 01:22:52,782
My husband is wounded!

1732
01:22:53,916 --> 01:22:56,353
MURRAY: Mickey!

1733
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,787
Mickey!

1734
01:22:57,819 --> 01:22:58,787
VIVIAN: Dad!

1735
01:22:58,820 --> 01:23:00,323
Mickey!

1736
01:23:00,355 --> 01:23:01,657
Let them go!

1737
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,527
Goes to detox and gets pregnant.

1738
01:23:03,559 --> 01:23:04,694
What is this?

1739
01:23:04,726 --> 01:23:05,894
MURRAY: Mickey!

1740
01:23:06,962 --> 01:23:08,432
Mickey!

1741
01:23:08,463 --> 01:23:09,598
VIVIAN: Dad!

1742
01:23:13,235 --> 01:23:15,339
Let them go.

1743
01:23:17,539 --> 01:23:19,744
MURRAY:
I don't have anything.

1744
01:23:19,776 --> 01:23:21,345
I got nothing left.

1745
01:23:21,376 --> 01:23:22,779
RICKEY: Dad.

1746
01:23:22,812 --> 01:23:25,149
VIVIAN: You got us, Dad.

1747
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:26,349
Dad.

1748
01:23:51,508 --> 01:23:52,943
VIVIAN: With Rita gone...

1749
01:23:52,977 --> 01:23:55,615
there'd be no more monthlies
from Uncle Mickey.

1750
01:23:55,646 --> 01:23:57,383
No more plush shag carpeting...

1751
01:23:57,414 --> 01:23:59,786
fancy dinette sets,
or swimming pools.

1752
01:23:59,818 --> 01:24:00,986
No more Camelot...

1753
01:24:01,019 --> 01:24:02,421
of Beverly Hills.

1754
01:24:02,453 --> 01:24:05,258
Just a future filled
with cheap rents and dingbats.

1755
01:24:05,289 --> 01:24:07,594
ELIOT: So, what is it,
like, over between us?

1756
01:24:07,626 --> 01:24:08,761
ls that it?

1757
01:24:08,793 --> 01:24:11,063
VIVIAN: I told you.
It was a building thing.

1758
01:24:11,096 --> 01:24:13,668
Oh, great. So you used me?

1759
01:24:13,698 --> 01:24:16,804
For my car, to lose
your virginity? W-what?

1760
01:24:16,835 --> 01:24:19,774
I liked you, OK?

1761
01:24:21,406 --> 01:24:22,708
I like you.

1762
01:24:23,742 --> 01:24:25,445
I just can't get attached.

1763
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:26,880
Why not?

1764
01:24:28,047 --> 01:24:29,984
My family. I can't.

1765
01:24:31,416 --> 01:24:33,153
We're nomads.

1766
01:24:38,391 --> 01:24:41,130
Better get out of here.

1767
01:25:21,169 --> 01:25:22,672
MURRAY: OK, everybody in?

1768
01:26:04,047 --> 01:26:06,552
Hey, doesn't Eva Gabor
live around here?

1769
01:26:09,219 --> 01:26:11,056
Ben, doesn't she?

1770
01:26:11,087 --> 01:26:13,826
I don't know, Viv.

1771
01:26:15,226 --> 01:26:17,396
Thought someone told me that.

1772
01:26:19,763 --> 01:26:22,068
Hey, that's it. Right there.

1773
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:24,636
Rickey, look.
That's Eva Gabor's house.

1774
01:26:24,667 --> 01:26:25,803
Who?

1775
01:26:25,836 --> 01:26:28,708
Eva Gabor, from "Green Acres."

1776
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:30,776
Where's Eva Gabor?

1777
01:26:30,808 --> 01:26:33,580
That one. You see it?
With the marble portico.

1778
01:26:33,611 --> 01:26:35,213
That's hers.

1779
01:26:35,247 --> 01:26:36,549
Whoa.

1780
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,951
Yeah, uh, you know, she--

1781
01:26:38,983 --> 01:26:41,989
she's supposed to have
this weird thing for poodles.

1782
01:26:42,020 --> 01:26:43,890
She, like, breeds them
or something like--

1783
01:26:43,922 --> 01:26:46,393
like a poodle farm
in her backyard.

1784
01:26:46,424 --> 01:26:48,661
Whoa, weird.

1785
01:26:50,829 --> 01:26:53,834
Dad, what do you say
we get some steak...

1786
01:26:53,865 --> 01:26:55,635
we get some steak
for lunch?

1787
01:26:55,667 --> 01:26:59,173
Not today.
I'm not in the mood.

1788
01:26:59,204 --> 01:27:00,840
You know, I could eat.

1789
01:27:00,872 --> 01:27:02,642
I mean, I need to beef up
for my role.

1790
01:27:02,674 --> 01:27:06,014
You know, I got the part, Dad.
Sky Masterson is mine!

1791
01:27:06,045 --> 01:27:08,015
Brando played him
in the movie, right?

1792
01:27:08,047 --> 01:27:09,015
That's right.

1793
01:27:09,048 --> 01:27:11,385
Yeah. "Guys and Dolls."

1794
01:27:11,416 --> 01:27:13,052
Terrific picture.

1795
01:27:13,085 --> 01:27:16,257
Frank Sinatra--Nathan Detroit.

1796
01:27:16,289 --> 01:27:18,226
VIVIAN:
Come on, Dad. It'll be fun.

1797
01:27:18,257 --> 01:27:21,864
We'll eat steak,
get our strength up.

1798
01:27:21,894 --> 01:27:24,199
Then we can look
for our new place.

1799
01:27:24,231 --> 01:27:25,533
What do you say, Dad?

1800
01:27:25,565 --> 01:27:27,135
We'll get 'em
how you used to serve them--

1801
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:30,172
this thick, seasoned, rare...
and bloody.

1802
01:27:30,204 --> 01:27:31,372
BEN: Yeah, Dad.

1803
01:27:31,404 --> 01:27:33,441
MURRAY:
All right. Who's hungry?

1804
01:27:33,473 --> 01:27:35,210
RICKEY: I am.

1805
01:27:35,242 --> 01:27:37,412
MURRAY:
OK. Let's go to Sizzler.

1806
01:27:37,443 --> 01:27:39,948
Yes! Yeah!

1807
01:27:44,785 --> 01:27:46,220
VIVIAN: I used to think
the good life...

1808
01:27:46,254 --> 01:27:49,360
was somewhere just outside
the window of my father's car...

1809
01:27:49,390 --> 01:27:52,062
but now
I see it's on the inside.

1810
01:27:52,093 --> 01:27:54,030
Sure, we didn't know where
we were going to live...

1811
01:27:54,062 --> 01:27:56,232
but we knew where we were going.

1812
01:27:56,264 --> 01:27:59,169
For us, the Abramowitzes
of Beverly Hills...

1813
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,506
a meal at Sizzler
meant that we were halfway home.
