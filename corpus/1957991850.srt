00:00:01,125 --> 00:00:03,828
[dynamic music]

2
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:16,407
[gentle music]

3
00:00:35,293 --> 00:00:37,996
[birds singing]

4
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:03,221
[music continues]

5
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,405
[birds singing]

6
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,723
[music continues]

7
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,285
Yes?

8
00:02:07,618 --> 00:02:09,420
They've started in the conference room.

9
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,755
[woman] Okay, good.

10
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:17,462
I need you to pull up a couple of files for me today.

11
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,665
I need 'em before lunch.

12
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,267
Need State v. Wilkins .

13
00:02:23,801 --> 00:02:26,070
The other one is probably in the advance files...

14
00:02:26,737 --> 00:02:28,106
I like your attack,

15
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,308
but now if you want them to believe your version

16
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:32,777
of the events, you have to make them see it.

17
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,945
- You have to-- - Clara?

18
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:35,079
- Sir? - You have call.

19
00:02:35,513 --> 00:02:36,547
Just a second.

20
00:02:37,048 --> 00:02:38,483
[clears throat] It's the professor.

21
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,384
Tell him I'll call him right back.

22
00:02:40,885 --> 00:02:41,919
It's about your mother.

23
00:02:44,889 --> 00:02:47,024
[gentle music]

24
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,726
Excuse me.

25
00:02:53,364 --> 00:02:55,133
The earliest memory I have is the sound

26
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:57,101
of my mother's voice.

27
00:02:58,436 --> 00:02:59,937
Though I was too young to understand

28
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,641
the meaning of her words, I do remember the feeling.

29
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,044
The feeling of being drawn to her voice,

30
00:03:07,178 --> 00:03:08,713
like a moth to the moon.

31
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:11,249
When I was finally able to understand

32
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:12,416
what she was saying,

33
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,385
the feeling only grew stronger.

34
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,990
You see, my mother was a storyteller.

35
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,326
Some say, the best Savannah had ever known.

36
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:25,763
Oh, people would come from miles around

37
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,666
to hear her weave a tale about the low country,

38
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,369
and not once did they ever leave disappointed.

39
00:03:34,205 --> 00:03:36,007
As I grew older, however,

40
00:03:36,874 --> 00:03:38,910
the fascination with my mother's stories

41
00:03:39,043 --> 00:03:40,077
began to fade.

42
00:03:42,813 --> 00:03:45,683
I found myself longing for more than

43
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:48,719
the hot, languid days of South Georgia.

44
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:54,859
At the age of 17, I finally left the magical,

45
00:03:54,992 --> 00:03:57,628
mysterious Savannah of my childhood.

46
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:04,802
And until the day my mother died, Savannah left me.

47
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,878
[indistinct chattering]

48
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:23,955
- Hey, Aunt Clara! - Oh, Jamie,

49
00:04:24,088 --> 00:04:25,723
look, you're losing your teeth!

50
00:04:25,856 --> 00:04:28,593
- Hi, baby. - [dog barking]

51
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:31,262
And you remember Alexa, Philomena's little girl?

52
00:04:31,395 --> 00:04:34,065
Yes, I do, her big girl, hi darling.

53
00:04:34,198 --> 00:04:36,133
Hi. I'm sorry about your mom.

54
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:37,935
- I liked her a lot. - Thank you.

55
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,606
Hmm. I knew there was a lawyer in the house.

56
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,441
My skin was starting to crawl.

57
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:45,943
Well, now, hush! This is no time for jokes.

58
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,445
Leave him alone, Wallis.

59
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,847
Doctors always think they're so funny.

60
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,649
You still practicing medicine?

61
00:04:52,783 --> 00:04:53,951
[Professor] Good Lord,

62
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:56,120
what the hell did you do to your hair?

63
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,822
It's called style, Professor.

64
00:04:57,955 --> 00:05:00,124
I doubt if you've ever heard the word.

65
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,693
You look beautiful, honey. It's good to see you.

66
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:05,162
Okay, everybody, back to the table.

67
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:06,330
We gotta finish our dinner.

68
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:07,598
[Jamie] But I don't like the peas.

69
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,133
Well, I don't mind if you don't like peas,

70
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,701
you just have to eat five.

71
00:05:10,835 --> 00:05:13,170
- If you don't eat five-- - When did the number

72
00:05:13,304 --> 00:05:14,772
- go down? - [Wallis] Oh no,

73
00:05:14,905 --> 00:05:16,340
the number went up!

74
00:05:16,474 --> 00:05:19,510
[indistinct chattering]

75
00:05:27,084 --> 00:05:30,988
[mysterious music]

76
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,828
[owl hooting]

77
00:05:39,597 --> 00:05:41,165
[water splashing]

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,802
[water splashing]

79
00:05:58,482 --> 00:06:00,985
[tense music]

80
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,694
[water splashing]

81
00:06:18,469 --> 00:06:19,737
[dog barking]

82
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,505
Kids, now hush, hush, hush.

83
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:24,909
You are gonna wake Clara up, shh, quiet!

84
00:06:25,042 --> 00:06:26,243
[whispers] You have to keep quiet.

85
00:06:26,377 --> 00:06:29,647
Well, I think the key today is to keep her busy.

86
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,048
Mm.

87
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,950
You know, so she doesn't think too much.

88
00:06:33,484 --> 00:06:35,786
Would that be the key to your success, Philomena?

89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,921
[Wallis] Daddy.

90
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:39,090
Very funny, Professor.

91
00:06:40,057 --> 00:06:42,593
Oh, Wallis,

92
00:06:43,728 --> 00:06:46,697
maybe you and I should take her to the club for lunch.

93
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:49,767
Well, now I believe

94
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,136
that is among the worst ideas I ever heard.

95
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,338
What? I think that'd be nice.

96
00:06:54,505 --> 00:06:56,407
What, you think surrounding a grieving woman

97
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,710
with a lot of nosy, drunken housewives is nice?

98
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:01,979
Well, maybe you're right.

99
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,149
I have to go see the minister about the service, so,

100
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,153
why don't you two take Clara for a nice walk in woods, hm?

101
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,522
I can't think of anything more dreadful.

102
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,058
I'd love to take a walk in the woods.

103
00:07:14,191 --> 00:07:15,259
If it's not a bother.

104
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,428
Oh, Clara.

105
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:19,597
Honey.

106
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:22,133
I am so sorry about your mama.

107
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,605
Now, if there is anything I can do, anything at all.

108
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,073
How about a cup of coffee?

109
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,175
Certainly.

110
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,411
- Morning. - Morning.

111
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,149
You really wanna come for a walk with us?

112
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,817
Yeah, I do.

113
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,353
- You really wanna take me? - Yeah.

114
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,921
Okay.

115
00:07:44,121 --> 00:07:46,457
[Alexa] We know where your name's carved in a tree.

116
00:07:51,162 --> 00:07:52,930
This is where we put ours.

117
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,434
[clears throat]

118
00:07:57,168 --> 00:08:03,908
Jamie plus Alexa, the year 2000, best friends forever.

119
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:05,943
Well, look at that.

120
00:08:06,877 --> 00:08:08,612
Yours is on the other side.

121
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:16,287
"Wallis plus Clara, 1970.

122
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,989
Best friends forever."

123
00:08:20,724 --> 00:08:22,827
They call this the friendship tree.

124
00:08:23,027 --> 00:08:24,161
Yeah.

125
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,297
That's what my mom told us.

126
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:31,635
[Jamie] Whoa!

127
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,073
Sometimes he shows up.

128
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,975
Sometimes he doesn't.

129
00:08:39,677 --> 00:08:41,178
What's his name again?

130
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:43,714
Fish Man. Half fish, half man.

131
00:08:45,049 --> 00:08:46,484
Did your mother ever tell you about the man

132
00:08:46,617 --> 00:08:47,818
who lived out in the woods?

133
00:08:48,352 --> 00:08:50,888
- [Jamie] Nope. - My mother told us about him.

134
00:08:52,356 --> 00:08:55,259
She said, "If you ever got lost in the woods,

135
00:08:55,392 --> 00:08:58,095
you shouldn't worry, because there's a man who lived

136
00:08:58,229 --> 00:09:00,164
out in the woods who would come and get you

137
00:09:00,297 --> 00:09:01,499
and bring you back home."

138
00:09:02,533 --> 00:09:06,203
And we spent hours and hours trying to get ourselves lost.

139
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:08,739
And finally I said to my mother, I said,

140
00:09:08,873 --> 00:09:12,243
"Mama, there ain't no man that lives out in the woods."

141
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,013
And she just smiled and said, "Oh yes there is,

142
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:18,249
you just lucky you haven't needed him."

143
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:20,851
You mean, you never saw him?

144
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:23,921
Nope, never did.

145
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,456
[bell tolling]

146
00:09:25,623 --> 00:09:27,291
[bird cawing]

147
00:09:27,424 --> 00:09:31,228
35 years ago, Mattie Collier showed up at my door

148
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:36,267
with a baby in her arms and asked me for a job.

149
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,569
Well, I didn't really have much to offer,

150
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,572
but she seemed like a nice woman.

151
00:09:41,705 --> 00:09:44,241
So I said to her, "How's your cooking?"

152
00:09:45,175 --> 00:09:46,210
Well.

153
00:09:47,745 --> 00:09:51,115
She gave me her brightest smile and said,

154
00:09:51,248 --> 00:09:55,052
"I guarantee you've never tasted anything like it."

155
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:58,122
[people laugh]

156
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:00,724
[Professor] She was right.

157
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:05,896
Turns out Mattie was one of the worst cooks

158
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,732
to ever step foot into the low country.

159
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,235
[people laugh]

160
00:10:11,368 --> 00:10:12,903
[Professor] I didn't know what to do.

161
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:18,342
But then, about a week later,

162
00:10:19,443 --> 00:10:22,212
and maybe 10 pounds lighter,

163
00:10:23,948 --> 00:10:27,918
I overheard her telling a bedtime story to the kids.

164
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:35,926
As I listened from the hallway, she lured me into a world

165
00:10:36,293 --> 00:10:37,928
I didn't even know existed.

166
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:41,832
A world so full of magic and wonder,

167
00:10:41,966 --> 00:10:43,834
that by the end I wanted to pack my bags

168
00:10:43,968 --> 00:10:45,169
and go there myself.

169
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:50,507
I knew right then that Mattie Collier

170
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:53,310
had a gift from God.

171
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:56,714
I took her right downstairs that evening,

172
00:10:57,815 --> 00:11:01,952
and I said, "Mattie, I cannot let you cook another meal

173
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:05,122
in this house, but I'll tell you what.

174
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,359
I'll pay you twice what you're getting now

175
00:11:08,492 --> 00:11:10,461
if you'll stay and tell stories."

176
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,665
And she looked at me like I was crazy and said,

177
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:16,734
"Tell stories to who?"

178
00:11:17,701 --> 00:11:21,038
"To whomever will listen," I answered.

179
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,540
With God as my witness,

180
00:11:25,809 --> 00:11:27,811
money could not have been better spent.

181
00:11:31,015 --> 00:11:32,116
I'm gonna miss Mattie.

182
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,651
[clears throat]

183
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:40,591
But I believe we should all take comfort from the knowledge

184
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:45,362
that her spirit remains in every story she ever told.

185
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:52,970
Stories that will be told again, and again, and again.

186
00:11:57,574 --> 00:11:59,710
May she grace heaven as she did the Earth.

187
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:05,049
Clara, honey, I want you to meet some neighbors of ours,

188
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,017
this is Marianne and Alfred Brooks.

189
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:08,552
Oh yes, hello.

190
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,154
- Hi. - My mother told me

191
00:12:10,287 --> 00:12:11,488
all about you.

192
00:12:11,622 --> 00:12:14,224
As matter of fact, I have one of your photographs

193
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,726
on my office wall.

194
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,061
That's right.

195
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,862
That beautiful old tree.

196
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:20,264
What'd your mama call it?

197
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:21,865
The wishing tree.

198
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,734
What's the wishing tree?

199
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,069
[Marianne] The wishing tree, my dear,

200
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:28,272
is a magical tree from one of Mattie's stories.

201
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:30,374
I never heard about it.

202
00:12:30,507 --> 00:12:32,276
Mattie told you that story at your birthday party.

203
00:12:32,409 --> 00:12:33,911
- Don't you remember? - [Jamie] Did not.

204
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,746
- Oh, she did! - [all laugh]

205
00:12:35,879 --> 00:12:36,914
No.

206
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,782
Do you know the story, Clara?

207
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:41,819
Um, I'm afraid I don't remember that one.

208
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,587
I do.

209
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:48,192
Will you tell it to us, Grandpa? Please?

210
00:12:48,325 --> 00:12:49,893
- [Alexa] Please? Pretty please. - [Jamie] Please.

211
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,829
Oh, come on Daddy, tell us.

212
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:53,597
[chuckles]

213
00:12:58,335 --> 00:13:01,638
The wishing tree is a very old story.

214
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:06,076
Took place way back in 1851

215
00:13:06,777 --> 00:13:09,847
on a dark and scary August night.

216
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:13,217
It was on that night,

217
00:13:13,717 --> 00:13:16,253
a little slave girl named Celia

218
00:13:16,386 --> 00:13:19,456
tried to escape from a plantation down the road.

219
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:24,762
Unfortunately, she didn't get very far

220
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:26,663
before the storm came.

221
00:13:26,797 --> 00:13:29,466
And what a storm it was!

222
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,170
Thunder so loud, it made the trees shake.

223
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,605
- Boom! - [thunder rumbles]

224
00:13:34,738 --> 00:13:35,773
[chuckles]

225
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:38,475
- [dramatic music] - [thunder cracking]

226
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:41,111
[horse neighing]

227
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,149
[men shouting indistinctly]

228
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,051
Come back here, girl!

229
00:13:52,689 --> 00:13:56,260
- [dogs barking] - [men shouting]

230
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,462
Right this way, boys, she's down this way!

231
00:14:00,264 --> 00:14:02,366
[music continues]

232
00:14:02,499 --> 00:14:05,369
[men shouting]

233
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,546
[dogs barking]

234
00:14:16,446 --> 00:14:19,683
[thunder cracking]

235
00:14:25,189 --> 00:14:26,623
[man] That's it, right here, right here.

236
00:14:29,693 --> 00:14:30,894
We got her, we got her!

237
00:14:32,262 --> 00:14:34,898
Please, please don't let them get me!

238
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,201
- [thunder cracking] - [horse neighing]

239
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,368
[man] Celia!

240
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,205
[music continues]

241
00:14:42,005 --> 00:14:43,173
Come on out of there, girl.

242
00:14:43,607 --> 00:14:45,309
I'm gonna have to shoot you down.

243
00:14:46,977 --> 00:14:48,212
I mean it, now!

244
00:14:48,612 --> 00:14:49,847
[gun firing]

245
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:52,616
You're gonna be dead before you're free, girl.

246
00:14:52,749 --> 00:14:55,252
[gun firing repeatedly]

247
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:59,556
[Professor] He could have shot at that tree all night,

248
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:02,593
but it wouldn't have made a bit of difference.

249
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:08,131
You see, Celia was gone!

250
00:15:09,499 --> 00:15:10,601
Disappeared!

251
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:17,441
Next morning, she awoke next to an elm tree in Philadelphia.

252
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:22,112
Had no idea where she was or how she got there.

253
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:27,351
But of one thing she was absolutely certain,

254
00:15:28,585 --> 00:15:32,322
for the first time in her life, she was free.

255
00:15:32,756 --> 00:15:33,991
[chuckles]

256
00:15:34,124 --> 00:15:36,593
All because of the wishing tree.

257
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,695
[all chuckle]

258
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:41,098
- [Wallis] I like that one. - [Clara] Mm-hmm.

259
00:15:41,365 --> 00:15:43,400
Al, can you show us where it is?

260
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:46,436
I wish I could, baby, but I don't remember.

261
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:48,972
Was it close?

262
00:15:49,606 --> 00:15:52,709
Well, I believe we walked there so it couldn't be too far.

263
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,482
[all chuckling]

264
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:03,553
Alexa, Jamie, you all need to keep track

265
00:16:03,687 --> 00:16:05,088
of where you are out there, okay?

266
00:16:05,222 --> 00:16:07,724
It's real easy to get lost in them woods, and baby,

267
00:16:07,858 --> 00:16:09,459
if you do find that tree,

268
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,962
don't go wishing you was someplace else

269
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:13,897
without telling me first, okay?

270
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:16,366
'Cause you know your daddy don't believe in all that magic stuff.

271
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:18,969
He's just gonna think you've been kidnapped, all right?

272
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,371
- There we go. - Can we go now?

273
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:24,107
Uh-huh. Couple of bananas. There you go.

274
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,310
- Have a good time. - Okay.

275
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:31,848
That'll keep 'em busy for a while.

276
00:16:32,082 --> 00:16:33,684
[Wallis chuckles]

277
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:37,788
You know, I think it's cruel to send them out looking

278
00:16:37,921 --> 00:16:39,823
for something you know they're never gonna find.

279
00:16:40,123 --> 00:16:41,525
Oh, come on, Clara, they're kids,

280
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:42,826
they're gonna have fun trying.

281
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,461
Excuse me.

282
00:16:45,329 --> 00:16:47,664
But what makes you two believe they'll never find that tree?

283
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,032
[Wallis chuckles]

284
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,002
Goodness gracious, Professor, you sound like Mama.

285
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:54,805
What's wrong, Clara?

286
00:16:55,439 --> 00:16:57,341
You too grown up to believe in magic?

287
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:01,411
[Wallis chuckles]

288
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:09,353
I wish I was six feet tall.

289
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:13,890
Mark it.

290
00:17:18,128 --> 00:17:21,331
What are we gonna do if you really turn six feet tall?

291
00:17:21,465 --> 00:17:24,201
Just wish myself back to normal, I guess.

292
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:26,336
What if you only get one wish?

293
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,871
I dunno.

294
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,340
I guess you'll have to wish me back.

295
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,343
Do you think I'm gonna waste my one wish on that?

296
00:17:33,477 --> 00:17:35,679
- I'd do it for you! - Would not!

297
00:17:35,812 --> 00:17:36,880
Would too!

298
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,882
- Would you, really? - Mm-hmm.

299
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,520
Well then, I guess I'd do it for you too.

300
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:52,195
I wish...I wish I never had to eat broccoli again.

301
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:57,367
We spent most of that afternoon repotting her plants.

302
00:17:58,568 --> 00:18:02,139
In the process, she made certain that I learned

303
00:18:02,272 --> 00:18:03,840
the names of all of them.

304
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,278
She said it would make them more comfortable.

305
00:18:08,845 --> 00:18:12,549
Afterwards, she thanked me with a kiss on the cheek

306
00:18:14,151 --> 00:18:17,754
and then went in for her five o'clock nap.

307
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:26,063
I realize now that somehow she knew her time had come.

308
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,799
[birds cawing]

309
00:18:28,932 --> 00:18:31,568
[gentle music]

310
00:18:44,848 --> 00:18:46,650
I can almost hear her humming.

311
00:18:51,788 --> 00:18:54,591
You know, a while back, I tried to start a catalog

312
00:18:54,724 --> 00:18:56,359
of your mother's stories.

313
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:59,096
Unfortunately, she didn't care too much for talking

314
00:18:59,229 --> 00:19:02,065
to a camera, so this is about as far as we got.

315
00:19:02,199 --> 00:19:05,001
- "Jenny and Joe." - Yeah, I remember that one.

316
00:19:05,135 --> 00:19:08,505
That was about that boy in the Civil War who got killed.

317
00:19:08,638 --> 00:19:10,207
But he came back as an angel.

318
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,275
Yes, to look after his lovely bride.

319
00:19:12,409 --> 00:19:13,777
Yeah, I always thought it was so sad.

320
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,645
I thought it'd make a good movie, you know?

321
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,880
[Professor chuckles]

322
00:19:17,013 --> 00:19:20,717
Oh, "The Secret Life of Louise," "Dolphin."

323
00:19:20,884 --> 00:19:24,387
Oh, look, it's "The Wishing Tree."

324
00:19:25,989 --> 00:19:27,557
"The Wishing Tree."

325
00:19:27,691 --> 00:19:29,826
Oh, ah.

326
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:35,332
More thoughts on the tree that doesn't exist.

327
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,737
This is the journal of a one Able Williams.

328
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:44,708
Owned a cotton plantation just outside Savannah.

329
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:50,213
August 17th, 1851, I marked the page.

330
00:19:51,681 --> 00:19:55,185
"Another windstorm last night,

331
00:19:55,318 --> 00:19:58,021
Celia, Jessie's daughter, tried to run.

332
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:00,957
The dogs caught up with her down near the river

333
00:20:01,091 --> 00:20:03,160
and chased her up a tree.

334
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:07,297
By the time we got there, she was nowhere to be found.

335
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,900
I'm not sure what happened to little Celia,

336
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:13,036
but I believe the Lord himself must have taken her.

337
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,773
Missing, presumed dead."

338
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:18,575
It's very interesting, Professor,

339
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:21,511
but it's hardly proof of a magical tree.

340
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:23,580
Well, you must admit, Clara,

341
00:20:23,713 --> 00:20:26,316
that something unusual happened that night.

342
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:29,286
Yeah, of course. A young girl escaped slavery.

343
00:20:29,753 --> 00:20:30,987
Look at you two.

344
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,689
Can you once agree on something?

345
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,359
Well, I'll grant that Clara may very well be right.

346
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,128
Yet at the same time,

347
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:40,564
I think she should open her mind to the possibility

348
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,465
that she just might be wrong.

349
00:20:42,599 --> 00:20:45,235
[gentle music]

350
00:20:49,773 --> 00:20:51,808
Would you two excuse me, please?

351
00:20:56,613 --> 00:20:57,814
Did I say something wrong?

352
00:20:57,948 --> 00:21:01,418
No Daddy, I just... she just needs a moment.

353
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:03,720
[bird cawing]

354
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:06,423
[Jamie] Celia only got one wish.

355
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,058
[Alexa] She only used one.

356
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:10,427
I bet she had at least two more coming.

357
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,963
[Jamie] Well, I know what I'm gonna wish for.

358
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:15,198
- [Alexa] What? - A hundred more wishes.

359
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:17,400
Jamie, don't be stupid.

360
00:21:17,534 --> 00:21:19,569
The tree is gonna know if you try to cheat,

361
00:21:19,703 --> 00:21:21,538
and then you'll end up with nothing.

362
00:21:22,973 --> 00:21:24,908
We've gotta think of something good.

363
00:21:25,275 --> 00:21:27,944
You know, like something nobody else can do.

364
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,748
[tense music]

365
00:21:31,881 --> 00:21:34,150
Jamie, stop, I'm trying to think.

366
00:21:34,384 --> 00:21:35,585
So am I!

367
00:21:35,719 --> 00:21:38,388
- [Alexa gasps and screams] - Shh!

368
00:21:38,788 --> 00:21:39,823
Shh!

369
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,260
Shh. Shh!

370
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,133
[mysterious music]

371
00:22:13,657 --> 00:22:15,825
- Wow, he's good! - Yeah.

372
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,529
[gentle music]

373
00:22:25,502 --> 00:22:26,603
[Jamie blows]

374
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:32,208
Whoa!

375
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,019
Hey, you okay?

376
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,188
Yeah.

377
00:22:47,057 --> 00:22:49,759
I just wish I got to see her one last time.

378
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:51,728
Hmm.

379
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:58,001
I imagine wherever she is, she's wishing the same thing.

380
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,638
She sure missed you a lot.

381
00:23:04,874 --> 00:23:06,109
Yeah, I know.

382
00:23:08,278 --> 00:23:10,380
So how come you didn't come visit more often?

383
00:23:21,458 --> 00:23:22,926
I was busy, Wallis.

384
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:25,528
You know, sometimes I think she thought

385
00:23:25,662 --> 00:23:27,097
you didn't come 'cause of her.

386
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:29,632
Well, I didn't come because I didn't want

387
00:23:29,766 --> 00:23:32,802
to end up another poor, uneducated Black woman,

388
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:34,604
dependent upon your father's charity.

389
00:23:35,405 --> 00:23:36,873
Why is that so hard to understand?

390
00:23:37,006 --> 00:23:38,375
My father's charity?

391
00:23:39,109 --> 00:23:41,244
[chuckles] What are you talking about?

392
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:43,913
Oh, come on.

393
00:23:44,848 --> 00:23:46,783
You heard him today at the service.

394
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:49,419
After all they've been through, after all this time,

395
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:51,421
all he could say about my mother was,

396
00:23:51,554 --> 00:23:55,091
she was some poor Black woman showed up on his doorstep

397
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:57,527
with a baby in her arms, looking for a job.

398
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,963
My father loved your mother.

399
00:24:00,363 --> 00:24:01,931
He didn't say that, did he?

400
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,466
Well, maybe not in so many words,

401
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,302
but he loved her and he loves you!

402
00:24:06,436 --> 00:24:08,805
I mean, for God's sakes.

403
00:24:10,673 --> 00:24:13,610
He is more proud of you than he is of me.

404
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:17,180
I mean, you should hear him bragging on Clara's doing this,

405
00:24:17,313 --> 00:24:19,115
and Clara's doing that, I mean.

406
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:23,820
Well, I am very appreciative of everything he's done,

407
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:26,356
but I am not under the illusion

408
00:24:26,523 --> 00:24:29,559
that I'm anything more than one of his projects.

409
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,362
Well, if that is really how you feel,

410
00:24:32,529 --> 00:24:34,030
then I feel sorry for you.

411
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,499
Because with all your big education,

412
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:39,602
you don't know anything about love.

413
00:24:41,004 --> 00:24:44,374
[gentle music]

414
00:24:54,918 --> 00:24:56,853
[dog barking]

415
00:24:58,988 --> 00:25:01,124
Clara, we found him!

416
00:25:01,257 --> 00:25:02,392
Found who, sweetie?

417
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,960
[Alexa] The man you told us about!

418
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:05,762
The one out in the woods.

419
00:25:05,895 --> 00:25:08,031
Ah, you did?

420
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:10,500
- [Jamie] And guess what, Clara? - What?

421
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,370
- He's magic too. - Really?

422
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,339
You wanna meet him?

423
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:18,875
No, I really have to get back to Atlanta.

424
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:22,946
Can't you go back tomorrow?

425
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:26,483
- [Alexa] Please, Clara? - Now kids, you heard

426
00:25:26,616 --> 00:25:28,184
what Clara said, she has to get back to work,

427
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,619
and you need to wash your hands.

428
00:25:29,752 --> 00:25:31,254
Come on, we're gonna eat supper in a few minutes.

429
00:25:31,387 --> 00:25:32,822
Go on, skip.

430
00:25:32,956 --> 00:25:35,058
Quick like a bunny, let's go, Jamie, come on.

431
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:37,961
- A bunny isn't too quick. - Well, he's pretty quick.

432
00:25:40,196 --> 00:25:42,365
You know, you're welcome to stay for dinner if you like.

433
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,634
Thanks.

434
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:47,804
But I really think I'd better get on the road

435
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,038
while it's still light.

436
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,841
Yeah, I guess that would be safer.

437
00:26:02,485 --> 00:26:04,521
Come on, scoot now, come on, out you get.

438
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:05,989
[dog barking]

439
00:26:07,657 --> 00:26:08,825
Anything else?

440
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,293
No, thanks.

441
00:26:13,162 --> 00:26:14,230
Godspeed.

442
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,665
- Okay. - Mm-hmm.

443
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,668
I don't want you staying too long between visits,

444
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:19,836
do you hear?

445
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,841
Love you, honey.

446
00:26:25,675 --> 00:26:27,911
[gentle music]

447
00:26:37,153 --> 00:26:39,188
[car engine starting]

448
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,126
[music continues]

449
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:59,042
[bird screeching]

450
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:04,080
[tense music]

451
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,769
[bird screeching]

452
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,348
[dog barking]

453
00:27:39,582 --> 00:27:40,583
Bean!

454
00:27:40,883 --> 00:27:42,085
Bean!

455
00:27:42,485 --> 00:27:44,087
What are you doing?

456
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,089
[dog barking]

457
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,297
I'm sorry.

458
00:27:55,231 --> 00:27:56,466
I'm sorry, come on.

459
00:27:56,699 --> 00:27:59,035
Come here, come here, baby.

460
00:27:59,669 --> 00:28:02,472
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, little guy.

461
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:05,575
Bean, I was on my way to Atlanta.

462
00:28:05,708 --> 00:28:06,809
You live in Savannah.

463
00:28:08,177 --> 00:28:09,212
[sighs]

464
00:28:09,345 --> 00:28:11,147
Supposed to be in Savannah.

465
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,952
[owl hooting]

466
00:28:23,693 --> 00:28:26,195
[dog barking]

467
00:28:27,296 --> 00:28:29,699
Stop that barking, stop that.

468
00:28:30,533 --> 00:28:32,769
[Clara speaking indistinctly]

469
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:34,070
[dog barking]

470
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:40,343
Hey, Bean.

471
00:28:41,377 --> 00:28:44,013
I was about an hour outside of Atlanta

472
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:45,748
and he jumped over the backseat.

473
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:48,785
Well, thanks for bringing him back.

474
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,854
Just made a fresh pot of tea.

475
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:53,456
You care to join me?

476
00:28:55,291 --> 00:28:56,859
I don't know why.

477
00:28:56,993 --> 00:28:58,361
I guess I'm losing my mind,

478
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:02,432
but I keep feeling like,

479
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:07,870
like, um... like Mama's still here.

480
00:29:09,172 --> 00:29:11,240
And I know this is strange,

481
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:17,046
but I keep feeling like she doesn't want me to leave.

482
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:21,350
No, no, I don't think that's strange.

483
00:29:21,484 --> 00:29:22,585
Not one bit.

484
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:26,889
I just...I know she's here.

485
00:29:27,356 --> 00:29:28,524
I can feel her.

486
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:31,060
I can. Every day.

487
00:29:32,595 --> 00:29:35,631
And I miss her.

488
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,301
I miss her so bad.

489
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:43,306
[both crying]

490
00:29:48,878 --> 00:29:50,213
[Wallis sighs]

491
00:29:50,346 --> 00:29:52,849
[bird cawing]

492
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,759
So is this how y'all spend the afternoons?

493
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,529
Listen, honey, you're not Southern

494
00:30:06,662 --> 00:30:09,599
if you can't sit and do nothing for a little while.

495
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,469
Are you writing country music or are you talking to me?

496
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:17,306
Well, I think Phil's point, Clara,

497
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,178
is that sometimes it's nice just to slow down a little bit.

498
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:25,314
Any slower than this and you'll be dead, darling.

499
00:30:25,548 --> 00:30:27,016
[chuckles] Well, all right then.

500
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,118
All right, come on.

501
00:30:29,252 --> 00:30:30,853
We got plenty to do in the garden.

502
00:30:30,987 --> 00:30:33,055
Oh no, you have got to be kidding.

503
00:30:33,222 --> 00:30:34,857
I don't believe she is, Clara.

504
00:30:35,424 --> 00:30:36,692
Come on.

505
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:40,496
[gentle music]

506
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:47,170
[turkey gobbling]

507
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,277
[music continues]

508
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:03,186
Did you make this?

509
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,089
It's pretty cool.

510
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:11,093
Magic Man, how come you live out here,

511
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,396
so far away from everything?

512
00:31:15,798 --> 00:31:17,033
Don't you get lonely?

513
00:31:20,069 --> 00:31:23,039
Well, don't you have any friends?

514
00:31:25,074 --> 00:31:27,710
[gentle music]

515
00:31:45,561 --> 00:31:47,330
Now, this was one of Mama Mattie's secrets

516
00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:48,965
for keeping the raccoons away.

517
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:51,500
She said you bury three cloves of garlic

518
00:31:51,634 --> 00:31:53,202
real close to the base of each plant

519
00:31:53,336 --> 00:31:54,770
and leave them there for one week.

520
00:31:55,771 --> 00:31:57,573
You know they sell these at the grocery.

521
00:31:57,707 --> 00:31:58,908
Yeah, I know that.

522
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,044
Like Mama Mattie always said,

523
00:32:02,178 --> 00:32:04,280
they taste better when you grow 'em yourself, mm.

524
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:06,883
- [Jamie] Hey, hey! - Mm, mm!

525
00:32:08,851 --> 00:32:10,553
Hey, you kids, what y'all doing?

526
00:32:10,853 --> 00:32:13,289
- Nothing. - Well then,

527
00:32:13,422 --> 00:32:15,057
Al and Marianne, they're looking for you.

528
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:16,726
They got something they wanna show you.

529
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:18,094
- What is it? - I don't know.

530
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:20,897
I guess you're gonna have to go and find out for yourself.

531
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,903
Hey, Clara. You wanna come with us?

532
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,906
Can you do without me?

533
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:33,809
- Well, I guess I can. - Coming!

534
00:32:38,681 --> 00:32:40,917
- So, Clara? - Yes.

535
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:44,186
What else did your mom say about that man in the woods?

536
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,355
I don't remember much.

537
00:32:46,956 --> 00:32:48,291
Why do you ask?

538
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,193
I'm just wondering if it's the same guy we found.

539
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:53,429
Hm, I don't know.

540
00:32:53,562 --> 00:32:55,298
Were you lost when you met him?

541
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:56,832
No.

542
00:32:56,966 --> 00:32:58,501
It was probably not the same one.

543
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:00,970
'Cause the one my mama told me about

544
00:33:01,103 --> 00:33:03,472
- only came if you got lost. - Hmm.

545
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,343
[Clara] Where are we going?

546
00:33:08,711 --> 00:33:12,481
[Marianne humming]

547
00:33:15,017 --> 00:33:16,352
Clara, maybe you should take a seat.

548
00:33:16,485 --> 00:33:17,586
You look a little pale.

549
00:33:20,723 --> 00:33:22,959
Is this really for a cookbook?

550
00:33:23,192 --> 00:33:26,862
Oh, it's more than a cookbook, dear.

551
00:33:28,431 --> 00:33:30,766
It's critter cuisine.

552
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:33,302
You think people will like it?

553
00:33:33,769 --> 00:33:34,937
Of course they will.

554
00:33:35,905 --> 00:33:40,176
I had armadillo with a nice worm sauce last night.

555
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:44,146
Best meal I've had in years.

556
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,715
[Marianne] Al, stop it.

557
00:33:46,048 --> 00:33:48,217
This is not for a real cookbook, kids.

558
00:33:48,351 --> 00:33:49,518
It's just a joke.

559
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:51,187
Marianne!

560
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,388
You didn't tell me.

561
00:33:53,522 --> 00:33:55,891
[Marianne chuckles]

562
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:59,462
So, when are you two gonna get married?

563
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:01,864
Not till after college.

564
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,032
[Al] Yeah?

565
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:06,369
That's about the time me and the missus first tied the knot.

566
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:11,240
You know, it'll be 30 years next week.

567
00:34:11,807 --> 00:34:12,842
Wow.

568
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,210
Congratulations.

569
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,512
Oh, we're planning a big party.

570
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:17,747
If you're still here then, Clara,

571
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,348
we'd love for you to join us.

572
00:34:19,715 --> 00:34:21,550
Thank you, I'd be honored.

573
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,653
So, you guys wanna know the secret

574
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:26,255
of making the marriage last?

575
00:34:26,756 --> 00:34:27,857
Okay.

576
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:30,559
Well, it's actually pretty simple.

577
00:34:32,895 --> 00:34:33,929
Laughter.

578
00:34:34,563 --> 00:34:36,032
If you're making each other laugh,

579
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,933
you're making each other happy.

580
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,969
- Ain't that right, honey? - Mm-hmm.

581
00:34:41,237 --> 00:34:43,539
Of course, the missus here ain't all that funny.

582
00:34:44,006 --> 00:34:46,409
So sometimes I have to pretend.

583
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:48,077
But that's easy.

584
00:34:48,411 --> 00:34:49,645
Go ahead, honey, say something.

585
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,214
I'll show you funny, mister,

586
00:34:52,348 --> 00:34:54,283
just as soon as these children here leave.

587
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:57,386
[laughs]

588
00:34:59,822 --> 00:35:00,890
See?

589
00:35:01,023 --> 00:35:02,091
That's all it takes.

590
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,759
[both giggle]

591
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,628
[Marianne laughs]

592
00:35:05,928 --> 00:35:08,230
He is funny, isn't he?

593
00:35:08,364 --> 00:35:10,266
That's why I love him so much.

594
00:35:10,866 --> 00:35:12,101
Come here, baby.

595
00:35:12,234 --> 00:35:13,235
Give me a hug.

596
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,871
[Marianne laughs]

597
00:35:18,307 --> 00:35:19,875
Ah, ah!

598
00:35:20,009 --> 00:35:21,744
Oh, oh!

599
00:35:21,877 --> 00:35:24,980
[all laughing]

600
00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:40,796
Lord, what a mess.

601
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,598
I have no idea what these kids were thinking.

602
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:45,901
They packed enough food here to feed an army.

603
00:35:46,035 --> 00:35:47,103
[Clara] You know, I'm a lawyer.

604
00:35:47,236 --> 00:35:48,904
Why am I the one who's gotta wash the dishes?

605
00:35:49,038 --> 00:35:50,806
Oh, you may be a lawyer, but you're my little poobly--

606
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,842
[laughs] Get the phone, will you?

607
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,211
- [Wallis laughs] - [Clara speaks indistinctly]

608
00:35:55,344 --> 00:35:56,378
Hello?

609
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:58,948
Oh, hi, Phil.

610
00:36:00,516 --> 00:36:01,717
No, they're not here.

611
00:36:03,152 --> 00:36:04,186
Uh-huh.

612
00:36:06,288 --> 00:36:07,857
She think they took her sheets.

613
00:36:08,591 --> 00:36:09,625
Her sheets?

614
00:36:10,426 --> 00:36:13,295
Oh, excuse me. Her Ralph Loren sheets.

615
00:36:14,263 --> 00:36:15,798
So, wh--

616
00:36:16,232 --> 00:36:18,033
Oh, Ralph Lauren sheets.

617
00:36:18,167 --> 00:36:19,468
[Wallis chuckles]

618
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,180
I couldn't find the picnic blanket.

619
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:33,015
So this will have to do.

620
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:35,518
We've got tons of stuff.

621
00:36:35,718 --> 00:36:38,320
Turkey, ham, roast beef.

622
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:40,322
Cheese and crackers.

623
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,825
And three different kinds of bread.

624
00:36:42,958 --> 00:36:45,161
'Cause we didn't know which one you'd like.

625
00:36:52,801 --> 00:36:55,004
[birds singing]

626
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:59,141
Alexa!

627
00:37:02,945 --> 00:37:04,213
Jamie!

628
00:37:20,229 --> 00:37:22,565
What should we do with the rest of the food?

629
00:37:30,339 --> 00:37:33,342
[clicking tongue]

630
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,648
[clicks tongue]

631
00:37:39,782 --> 00:37:41,617
[gentle music]

632
00:37:57,633 --> 00:38:00,769
[tense music]

633
00:38:15,384 --> 00:38:16,552
What are y'all doing?

634
00:38:18,354 --> 00:38:19,421
Uh-oh.

635
00:38:20,656 --> 00:38:22,324
What are you all doing out here?

636
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:25,160
We were feeding a deer until you showed up.

637
00:38:26,195 --> 00:38:27,630
Yeah, I noticed that.

638
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:33,769
Is this a friend of yours?

639
00:38:34,136 --> 00:38:35,504
Yeah, it's Magic Man.

640
00:38:35,638 --> 00:38:37,139
The one we told you about.

641
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:42,011
I don't remember you telling me about anybody.

642
00:38:42,578 --> 00:38:44,580
[Alexa] Clara, yes we did.

643
00:38:45,814 --> 00:38:47,816
Did I see you out by the highway the other day?

644
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:52,955
Right, so you live around here?

645
00:38:53,489 --> 00:38:56,558
[Alexa] Clara, we told you, he lives out in the woods.

646
00:38:56,692 --> 00:38:58,294
Baby, let the man do his own talking.

647
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,864
He can't, Clara, he can't talk.

648
00:39:05,934 --> 00:39:08,137
Oh, I didn't know.

649
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,511
I think he said it's nice to meet ya.

650
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:27,222
It's nice to meet you, too.

651
00:39:29,491 --> 00:39:30,559
Magic Man.

652
00:39:35,698 --> 00:39:37,333
Does your mother know about this man?

653
00:39:37,466 --> 00:39:38,867
No, and you can't tell her.

654
00:39:39,268 --> 00:39:40,469
Why not?

655
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:43,005
Because she might think he's weird or something

656
00:39:43,138 --> 00:39:45,207
and not let us play with him.

657
00:39:45,808 --> 00:39:47,710
Well, she might be right, Jamie.

658
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,678
Well, do you think he's weird?

659
00:39:50,612 --> 00:39:54,049
No, I don't know, he seems like a nice man.

660
00:39:55,317 --> 00:39:59,088
Okay then, you've gotta swear to secrecy.

661
00:39:59,555 --> 00:40:00,789
Why?

662
00:40:00,923 --> 00:40:04,560
Because, we've gotta know you're not going to tell.

663
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,495
No, why secrecy?

664
00:40:06,628 --> 00:40:08,530
Your mother will probably think he's fine too,

665
00:40:08,664 --> 00:40:10,966
- if she meets him. - No, he's too shy.

666
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:13,369
He doesn't wanna meet anyone else.

667
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:15,804
You've gotta swear, Clara.

668
00:40:16,338 --> 00:40:18,540
I'm not swearing to anything.

669
00:40:18,674 --> 00:40:19,908
I don't really know him.

670
00:40:21,343 --> 00:40:22,878
But I tell you what I will do.

671
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,748
I'll keep a secret if you two promise

672
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:27,916
not to go and see him without me.

673
00:40:30,185 --> 00:40:31,587
Do we have a deal?

674
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,856
- Yeah. - Okay.

675
00:40:34,857 --> 00:40:35,891
Good.

676
00:40:36,959 --> 00:40:38,994
And by the way, you two are in a heap of trouble

677
00:40:39,128 --> 00:40:41,230
for taking all that stuff from the house.

678
00:40:42,131 --> 00:40:43,499
But luckily for you,

679
00:40:43,632 --> 00:40:46,702
I am an attorney and I might be able to get you out of it.

680
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,606
I didn't know they're your favorite sheets, Mom,

681
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,141
or else I wouldn't have taken them.

682
00:40:52,608 --> 00:40:53,876
Mm.

683
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:56,412
[Alexa] We just want something to build a fort with.

684
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,314
But Clara's took us shopping and look,

685
00:40:59,448 --> 00:41:01,116
we got you the same ones.

686
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,284
Ralph Lauren.

687
00:41:02,451 --> 00:41:04,420
Oh, well, isn't that sweet?

688
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:08,357
[Jamie] We also went grocery shopping, Mama,

689
00:41:08,724 --> 00:41:10,592
and bought a bunch of new food.

690
00:41:10,726 --> 00:41:12,661
But Jamie, that is not the point.

691
00:41:12,795 --> 00:41:15,731
I even got you Ben and Jerry's Chunky Monkey,

692
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,766
'cause I know it's your favorite.

693
00:41:17,966 --> 00:41:19,334
[Wallis] Now you listen to me young man.

694
00:41:19,468 --> 00:41:22,938
You do not go taking things without asking for them first.

695
00:41:23,071 --> 00:41:25,174
We don't do those things around this house.

696
00:41:31,647 --> 00:41:32,948
I'm sorry, Mom.

697
00:41:35,918 --> 00:41:39,588
Well now, did somebody say something about Chunky Monkey?

698
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:42,858
All right, I guess we'll just forget about all this,

699
00:41:42,991 --> 00:41:44,226
and have us some ice cream!

700
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:48,464
I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!

701
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,898
- [Jamie] Yay! - [Wallis laughs]

702
00:41:50,032 --> 00:41:51,667
- Have you had some already? - [Alexa] Go, let's go!

703
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,135
[Wallis] You're getting heavy, come on.

704
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:59,241
- [thunder rumbling] - [mysterious music]

705
00:42:07,516 --> 00:42:10,085
[rain pattering]

706
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:21,797
[thunder rumbling]

707
00:42:25,367 --> 00:42:28,871
[tense music]

708
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,640
[birds calling]

709
00:42:38,814 --> 00:42:40,516
[water splashing]

710
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:46,922
[imitating bird call]

711
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:52,361
[imitating bird call]

712
00:42:53,562 --> 00:42:56,598
[mysterious music]

713
00:43:20,822 --> 00:43:24,226
What they didn't know is that little Celia

714
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,962
had found the wishing tree.

715
00:43:27,629 --> 00:43:31,066
A tree like none other in the world.

716
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:37,072
So when she said, "Please, please don't let them get me,"

717
00:43:38,273 --> 00:43:41,810
the tree granted her wish and took her away.

718
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,746
A couple of days later,

719
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:48,517
she awoke beneath a towering elm tree.

720
00:43:49,384 --> 00:43:53,488
And what little Celia probably thought was heaven

721
00:43:53,622 --> 00:43:56,058
turned out to be Philadelphia.

722
00:43:57,192 --> 00:44:00,963
Imagine that, thinking any place up north was heaven.

723
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:02,965
[chuckles]

724
00:44:04,066 --> 00:44:07,603
[laughs] Oh, I'm just kidding.

725
00:44:08,604 --> 00:44:10,339
I hear it's nice up there.

726
00:44:10,472 --> 00:44:11,707
[Professor on tape] Tell me something.

727
00:44:11,907 --> 00:44:13,775
Why is it that all your stories

728
00:44:13,909 --> 00:44:15,477
seem to be set in Georgia?

729
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,146
Oh, Professor.

730
00:44:18,313 --> 00:44:19,548
[chuckles]

731
00:44:20,515 --> 00:44:22,918
I don't just live in Georgia.

732
00:44:23,352 --> 00:44:25,554
Georgia lives in me.

733
00:44:26,088 --> 00:44:27,289
[Professor on tape] I'm sorry.

734
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:29,625
I'm afraid I don't understand.

735
00:44:29,891 --> 00:44:31,660
[chuckles]

736
00:44:31,793 --> 00:44:33,195
I doubt you would.

737
00:44:34,262 --> 00:44:36,632
Even if I explained it.

738
00:44:40,936 --> 00:44:43,171
I still don't know what the hell she meant by that.

739
00:44:48,377 --> 00:44:51,413
Go on, go on, I think there's another one on there.

740
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:56,118
[Mattie on tape] Okay.

741
00:44:56,251 --> 00:44:58,487
I think we've got time for one more.

742
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:05,360
Oh, here's a good one.

743
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,530
This-- [clears throat]

744
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:13,869
This was one of Clara's favorites when she was little.

745
00:45:15,504 --> 00:45:18,040
She called it "The Dreamer."

746
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:22,010
Not too long ago,

747
00:45:22,144 --> 00:45:26,214
there was a boy by the name of Alvin Bailey,

748
00:45:26,982 --> 00:45:29,351
who lived out on Tybee Island.

749
00:45:29,484 --> 00:45:30,719
[gentle music]

750
00:45:30,852 --> 00:45:33,855
Now Alvin had what his mother liked to call

751
00:45:33,989 --> 00:45:36,258
an active imagination.

752
00:45:36,958 --> 00:45:41,463
You see, Alvin used to lie all the time.

753
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,534
When he didn't chop the wood like he was supposed to,

754
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:48,737
Alvin came up with a story about how a bear

755
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:51,173
ran off with the ax.

756
00:45:51,773 --> 00:45:55,444
And when he broke his father's watch,

757
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,414
he blamed it on a ghost who lived up in the attic.

758
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:03,552
Now, little Alvin went on for years and years like this,

759
00:46:03,685 --> 00:46:06,221
making up excuses for everything.

760
00:46:06,354 --> 00:46:09,191
Till one night, he had a dream.

761
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:14,629
He dreamt about a big tree falling on the barn

762
00:46:14,763 --> 00:46:16,898
and smashing it to pieces.

763
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:21,603
Well, the next day, a storm came through

764
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:24,673
and just like in Alvin's dream,

765
00:46:24,806 --> 00:46:28,944
a tree fell and smashed that barn to bits.

766
00:46:29,077 --> 00:46:33,782
Now, little Alvin carried on like you wouldn't believe.

767
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,651
But no one believed.

768
00:46:37,552 --> 00:46:41,556
No one believed that his dream had come true.

769
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:53,101
Clara?

770
00:46:55,737 --> 00:46:56,772
Yeah?

771
00:46:57,472 --> 00:46:58,573
You okay?

772
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,877
Oh, I'm just doing nothing, y'all.

773
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,480
[Wallis chuckles]

774
00:47:08,683 --> 00:47:10,685
- Hey, you ready? - [Alexa] Yeah.

775
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:14,256
Um, we'll be back in a bit.

776
00:47:14,389 --> 00:47:16,024
We're going to look for the wishing tree.

777
00:47:18,093 --> 00:47:20,295
[gentle music]

778
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,063
[Alexa] Come on, Jamie!

779
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:33,341
[music continues]

780
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,535
[Clara screams]

781
00:48:06,374 --> 00:48:08,009
A fish, and a big one!

782
00:48:08,143 --> 00:48:09,945
- A big fish, whoa! - [Clara screaming]

783
00:48:10,078 --> 00:48:12,214
Can I see it? Can I see it?

784
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:15,116
- [Clara laughs] - Can I see it? Can I see it?

785
00:48:16,218 --> 00:48:17,919
[dramatic music]

786
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:23,225
[gentle music]

787
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,630
Whoa!

788
00:48:28,763 --> 00:48:29,965
[smacking lips]

789
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,110
[birds singing]

790
00:48:47,749 --> 00:48:50,385
[gentle music]

791
00:49:04,065 --> 00:49:05,567
[Alexa] Magic Man.

792
00:49:06,301 --> 00:49:08,069
Can we roast some marshmallows?

793
00:49:12,974 --> 00:49:14,743
[music continues]

794
00:49:19,681 --> 00:49:20,982
So, tell me something.

795
00:49:22,117 --> 00:49:25,720
Are you known by another name, besides Magic Man?

796
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,359
What is...?

797
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,668
[Clara] Thomas!

798
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,003
Thomas.

799
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,673
Me?

800
00:49:47,242 --> 00:49:49,210
C. L.

801
00:49:58,653 --> 00:50:00,622
[chuckles]

802
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:04,960
C. L.

803
00:50:07,829 --> 00:50:09,164
A?

804
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:15,236
R. I am never gonna remember this.

805
00:50:16,905 --> 00:50:18,206
A.

806
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,044
Name?

807
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:24,412
Me.

808
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,352
Clara.

809
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,820
You gave me a name?

810
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,022
Clara, Clara.

811
00:50:37,492 --> 00:50:41,663
You want me...

812
00:50:44,165 --> 00:50:45,367
hear?

813
00:50:45,767 --> 00:50:49,537
You...you want me to hear you?

814
00:50:52,307 --> 00:50:53,575
That would be nice.

815
00:50:59,614 --> 00:51:00,682
Hey, Magic Man.

816
00:51:00,815 --> 00:51:02,650
Show Clara one of your tricks.

817
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,854
Oh, come on.

818
00:51:05,987 --> 00:51:08,423
They must call you Magic Man for a reason.

819
00:51:10,225 --> 00:51:12,394
Magic Man, your marshmallow's burning.

820
00:51:16,531 --> 00:51:17,665
[Jamie gasps]

821
00:51:23,705 --> 00:51:25,040
Oh my God!

822
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,076
[kids laugh]

823
00:51:30,011 --> 00:51:32,714
Your hands aren't even burnt!

824
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,083
Oh yeah, yeah, ha-ha.

825
00:51:35,617 --> 00:51:37,218
[both laugh]

826
00:51:38,453 --> 00:51:39,654
[blowing rapidly]

827
00:51:39,854 --> 00:51:42,757
[kids laugh]

828
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,926
[Clara laughs, exclaims]

829
00:51:46,995 --> 00:51:48,396
Ah, now, there you are.

830
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,265
I thought you said you were just going for a walk.

831
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,034
Sorry, we got a little hung up,

832
00:51:53,168 --> 00:51:54,602
looking for the wishing tree.

833
00:51:55,203 --> 00:51:57,605
You mean to say y'all spent all day looking for that tree?

834
00:51:57,939 --> 00:52:00,041
There are a lot of trees out there, Will.

835
00:52:00,175 --> 00:52:02,877
And we have a complicated process.

836
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:06,381
- [Will] Huh. - [Wallis] Okay, Jamie,

837
00:52:06,514 --> 00:52:08,349
take your napkin up, did you wash your hands

838
00:52:08,483 --> 00:52:09,751
before you came in here, young man?

839
00:52:11,019 --> 00:52:12,353
Pass the corn over here, honey.

840
00:52:12,787 --> 00:52:14,756
- Sure can. - [Wallis] Now then.

841
00:52:19,794 --> 00:52:21,763
Jamie, you took off those dirty boots, didn't you?

842
00:52:21,896 --> 00:52:25,600
- Oh yes, yes. - [Wallis] Catch anything?

843
00:52:27,068 --> 00:52:28,937
[both laugh]

844
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:31,639
Oh, now I got Jamie asking me how come

845
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,842
I'm not as cool as Clara.

846
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:36,711
I don't think I'd ever see that day.

847
00:52:41,316 --> 00:52:43,118
Remember when we used to sneak beer out here.

848
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:45,520
- Mm. - We thought we were so bad.

849
00:52:45,653 --> 00:52:46,855
Yeah, I do. [laughs]

850
00:52:46,988 --> 00:52:50,725
But I don't think I ever told you, this is kind of funny,

851
00:52:50,892 --> 00:52:55,497
but I never, well, I would drink it like this.

852
00:52:56,097 --> 00:52:58,466
- Pretend to take a sip... - [laughs]

853
00:52:58,600 --> 00:53:00,668
because I could not stand the taste!

854
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:04,305
[both laugh]

855
00:53:04,439 --> 00:53:06,241
No wonder you never had to pee!

856
00:53:06,374 --> 00:53:08,343
Well, I gotta pee now!

857
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,478
- Are you drinking it? - Yeah, I'm drinking it.

858
00:53:10,612 --> 00:53:12,213
It's going in one end, out the other.

859
00:53:12,347 --> 00:53:13,581
- I'll tell you what. - Okay, wait,

860
00:53:13,715 --> 00:53:15,316
rock it girl, before you go.

861
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:16,985
I got the distance.

862
00:53:17,552 --> 00:53:18,586
Okay, eight feet.

863
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,589
- Mm, mm. - Mm.

864
00:53:22,857 --> 00:53:23,892
Oh-ho!

865
00:53:24,025 --> 00:53:26,594
[Wallis and Clara shouting in distance]

866
00:53:26,728 --> 00:53:28,596
[Will] They sure are having a good time.

867
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:34,569
Sounds like they're sneaking beers out to the deck again.

868
00:53:34,702 --> 00:53:37,005
[Wallis and Clara laughing]

869
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:39,140
- [Alexa] You're it! - [Jamie and Alexa laugh]

870
00:53:39,274 --> 00:53:41,442
- [Jamie] You're it! - [Jamie and Alexa shrieking]

871
00:53:42,844 --> 00:53:46,147
[Clara] After several years of 72 hour weeks,

872
00:53:46,281 --> 00:53:48,016
I decided if I was gonna work that hard,

873
00:53:48,149 --> 00:53:49,551
I might as well be working for myself.

874
00:53:49,684 --> 00:53:54,022
So, I went out on my own and it was a little scary at first,

875
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:59,093
but three and a half years later I have 32 attorneys

876
00:53:59,227 --> 00:54:02,263
and more business than I know what to do with.

877
00:54:03,331 --> 00:54:04,365
Oh yes, yeah.

878
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:08,036
It's pretty good for a small town girl, yeah.

879
00:54:09,837 --> 00:54:11,906
You know what? There's a party tomorrow.

880
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:13,975
That's an anniversary celebration actually

881
00:54:14,142 --> 00:54:15,376
for some neighbors.

882
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:17,946
You should come and meet some folks.

883
00:54:18,846 --> 00:54:19,881
Why not?

884
00:54:21,082 --> 00:54:22,116
What?

885
00:54:23,618 --> 00:54:24,652
Oh!

886
00:54:28,356 --> 00:54:32,460
It would mean a lot to Jamie and Alexa, and to me.

887
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:36,264
They're good people, Thomas.

888
00:54:36,531 --> 00:54:38,566
[bird cawing]

889
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:42,136
Will you at least think about it?

890
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,607
[tense music]

891
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:48,276
Good.

892
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:50,378
Thanks.

893
00:54:51,212 --> 00:54:52,747
So I hope to see you tomorrow.

894
00:55:10,531 --> 00:55:11,532
[Al] Okay, here we go now.

895
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:12,934
You guys stay right here, come on.

896
00:55:13,067 --> 00:55:14,302
Let's stay.

897
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:17,138
Look, if you can see the lens, if you can see the lens,

898
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,473
the lens can see you.

899
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,276
Okay, come on in a little bit, kids.

900
00:55:21,409 --> 00:55:24,612
There you go, come on, it's gonna be great.

901
00:55:24,746 --> 00:55:27,348
It's gonna be great. All right.

902
00:55:27,849 --> 00:55:30,885
It was easier shooting gazelles on the plains of Africa.

903
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:32,487
Wait one minute, I've gotta go get my lipstick,

904
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:34,656
- I left it in the car. - [Will] Oh, no, no, no.

905
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,992
[indistinct chattering]

906
00:55:38,593 --> 00:55:40,061
[Al] Okay, okay, are we ready?

907
00:55:40,228 --> 00:55:41,963
No, we're still waiting on Clara.

908
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:45,700
- [Will] Where's Clara? - [Jamie] Here she comes!

909
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:47,468
- [Wallis] Oh, yeah! - I'm sorry.

910
00:55:47,602 --> 00:55:49,070
I didn't know you were waiting.

911
00:55:49,337 --> 00:55:52,006
- [woman] It's about time! - [laughter]

912
00:55:52,507 --> 00:55:54,342
Guess who I invited to the party?

913
00:55:54,976 --> 00:55:56,210
- Magic Man? - Yep.

914
00:55:56,344 --> 00:55:57,679
[Alexa] He gonna come?

915
00:55:57,812 --> 00:55:59,380
I don't know, he said he'd think about it.

916
00:56:00,248 --> 00:56:01,582
Clara, dear.

917
00:56:01,716 --> 00:56:03,551
We need you to stand up straight.

918
00:56:07,522 --> 00:56:09,490
You know, honey, we probably have time to still

919
00:56:09,624 --> 00:56:11,392
- get a tent. - Trust me, baby.

920
00:56:11,526 --> 00:56:15,229
It is not going to rain on this glorious day.

921
00:56:15,496 --> 00:56:18,232
Oh, just take the picture.

922
00:56:18,366 --> 00:56:20,034
Okay, here we go.

923
00:56:21,703 --> 00:56:24,372
- [thunder rumbling] - [everyone clamors]

924
00:56:24,505 --> 00:56:26,941
- [camera clicking] - [everyone laughs]

925
00:56:27,308 --> 00:56:30,111
[smooth music]

926
00:56:33,815 --> 00:56:35,016
Don't worry about it, baby.

927
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:36,584
It ain't even coming this way.

928
00:56:36,718 --> 00:56:38,486
You sure about that, Al?

929
00:56:38,619 --> 00:56:40,722
Looks like the wind's blowing it in.

930
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:42,657
Son, let me explain something to you.

931
00:56:43,558 --> 00:56:44,959
Never let a woman know you've made

932
00:56:45,093 --> 00:56:46,394
the mistake I've made today.

933
00:56:46,561 --> 00:56:47,962
You will never live it down.

934
00:56:48,096 --> 00:56:50,765
Mm. Is that why you're marrying her again?

935
00:56:51,532 --> 00:56:54,569
Must be some weather phenomenon we can blame it on.

936
00:56:54,736 --> 00:56:56,504
- [thunder rumbling] - [Will] Mm-hmm.

937
00:56:56,637 --> 00:56:57,905
Just wouldn't want to be in your shoes.

938
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,374
[Al chuckles]

939
00:57:00,475 --> 00:57:02,276
You still think he's coming?

940
00:57:02,410 --> 00:57:04,145
Pardon me, missy.

941
00:57:04,278 --> 00:57:05,813
I hadn't known about the--

942
00:57:05,947 --> 00:57:07,515
What if he doesn't know where we are?

943
00:57:07,648 --> 00:57:09,417
I know, I think it's okay.

944
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:12,420
[indistinct chattering]

945
00:57:14,689 --> 00:57:16,290
I'm gonna go look for Magic Man.

946
00:57:16,424 --> 00:57:17,458
Okay.

947
00:57:20,194 --> 00:57:21,229
Bye.

948
00:57:21,362 --> 00:57:23,531
[thunder rumbling]

949
00:57:25,133 --> 00:57:27,702
[tense music]

950
00:57:30,304 --> 00:57:33,608
[wind blowing]

951
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,916
[music continues]

952
00:57:50,425 --> 00:57:54,729
[man] Do you, Marianne Brooks, promise to love,

953
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:59,100
- respect and cherish-- - And forgive Al Brooks

954
00:57:59,233 --> 00:58:01,035
for not getting a tent.

955
00:58:01,169 --> 00:58:02,336
[laughter]

956
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:05,006
And forgive Al Brooks for not getting a tent,

957
00:58:05,139 --> 00:58:06,741
till death do you part?

958
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:09,844
Hm!

959
00:58:09,977 --> 00:58:12,847
[laughter]

960
00:58:14,982 --> 00:58:16,584
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

961
00:58:16,717 --> 00:58:19,120
- [all cheering] - [thunder rumbling]

962
00:58:21,889 --> 00:58:23,758
[Al laughs]

963
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:25,226
I win every time.

964
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,894
[Marianne laughs]

965
00:58:27,028 --> 00:58:28,062
Where's Jamie?

966
00:58:28,196 --> 00:58:30,364
He went to get Magic Man.

967
00:58:30,498 --> 00:58:31,532
What?

968
00:58:34,735 --> 00:58:38,139
[dramatic music]

969
00:58:46,113 --> 00:58:49,417
- [thunder cracking] - [people screaming]

970
00:58:51,686 --> 00:58:54,655
[thunder cracking]

971
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,961
Jamie!

972
00:59:01,062 --> 00:59:02,663
Jamie!

973
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:05,700
Clara, where's Jamie, where's my boy?

974
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:07,869
- He went into the woods. - He went into the woods?

975
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:09,871
- Why? - He's looking for someone.

976
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,107
- Jamie! - Who?! Will! Will!

977
00:59:14,208 --> 00:59:18,045
Clara? Clara, do you even know who this man is?

978
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:20,114
He's probably just taking shelter from the storm.

979
00:59:20,248 --> 00:59:22,049
He's nothing to be afraid of, Wallis.

980
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,885
- Jamie! - [Wallis] Will!

981
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,419
[Clara] Thomas!

982
00:59:27,255 --> 00:59:28,289
Thomas!

983
00:59:29,056 --> 00:59:30,091
Jamie?

984
00:59:32,326 --> 00:59:35,029
[somber music]

985
00:59:37,331 --> 00:59:39,367
[Will] Jamie? Jamie?

986
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:42,904
Jamie!

987
00:59:46,140 --> 00:59:48,543
What in God's name were you thinking, Clara?

988
00:59:48,676 --> 00:59:50,411
- [man] Thomas! - [man 2] Jamie!

989
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:52,914
How could you not tell me about this?

990
00:59:55,082 --> 00:59:56,918
[woman over radio] Unit family two, unit family two.

991
00:59:57,051 --> 00:59:59,153
Found matching the description of Jamie Caldwell

992
00:59:59,287 --> 01:00:03,157
has been located, currently en route to Savannah General.

993
01:00:03,291 --> 01:00:05,960
- Oh my God. - [man] They found him!

994
01:00:06,093 --> 01:00:08,629
- Let's go, boys! - [tense music]

995
01:00:12,199 --> 01:00:14,435
[doctor] He's got fractures in both forearms.

996
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,470
My guess is these are defensive wounds

997
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:18,639
and he was trying to protect himself like this.

998
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:22,109
Now, he's got a skull fracture and a small subdural hematoma,

999
01:00:22,877 --> 01:00:25,046
but there's no major intercerebral hemorrhage.

1000
01:00:25,179 --> 01:00:28,449
- So he's lucky. - Oh, lucky!

1001
01:00:29,016 --> 01:00:31,686
[monitor beeping]

1002
01:00:36,290 --> 01:00:38,326
[woman over PA] Doctor Swan to obstetrics.

1003
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:40,628
Doctor Swan to obstetrics.

1004
01:00:48,135 --> 01:00:49,704
[Wallis] Jamie?

1005
01:00:51,072 --> 01:00:52,373
Over there, thank you.

1006
01:00:52,673 --> 01:00:55,009
[woman over PA] Doctor [indistinct] line three.

1007
01:00:55,142 --> 01:00:56,611
Hi, excuse me, Doctor [indistinct]?

1008
01:00:56,744 --> 01:00:58,112
[Professor] Yes.

1009
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:00,815
- Yes. - John Crane,

1010
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,083
Savannah Police Department.

1011
01:01:02,216 --> 01:01:04,785
I have some information regarding your son.

1012
01:01:05,052 --> 01:01:06,287
Do you have a moment?

1013
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:09,290
Okay, now.

1014
01:01:10,992 --> 01:01:13,961
Hey, now this tape is from the officer that found your son.

1015
01:01:14,495 --> 01:01:17,131
He had one of those video cameras up on top of his dash.

1016
01:01:17,531 --> 01:01:19,800
It was recorded over on Blaylock Road.

1017
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:21,535
[officer on tape] Just put the boy on the ground,

1018
01:01:21,669 --> 01:01:22,803
right now!

1019
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:24,372
[Crane] You get them to lie down.

1020
01:01:24,505 --> 01:01:26,507
That's just a regular procedure there,

1021
01:01:27,174 --> 01:01:28,809
and holster his gun.

1022
01:01:29,243 --> 01:01:30,411
Okay, now,

1023
01:01:30,544 --> 01:01:31,646
here's where everything gets a little strange.

1024
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:34,382
He picks up your son,

1025
01:01:34,515 --> 01:01:35,983
starts to walk back to the car.

1026
01:01:36,684 --> 01:01:38,986
At one point he blocks the camera's view of the suspect,

1027
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:41,055
see right there, right there, he's blocked.

1028
01:01:41,355 --> 01:01:43,057
He's completely blocked right there.

1029
01:01:43,524 --> 01:01:45,559
Okay, now the officer steps out of the way,

1030
01:01:47,695 --> 01:01:49,130
the suspect is gone.

1031
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:55,403
And at this point, we haven't been able to locate him.

1032
01:01:55,836 --> 01:01:58,906
Detective, you keep referring to him as the suspect.

1033
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,876
What exactly do you suspect him of doing?

1034
01:02:02,476 --> 01:02:03,878
Attempted kidnapping, Ms. Collier.

1035
01:02:04,111 --> 01:02:05,546
Oh, that's ridiculous.

1036
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,982
My goodness, he would never do that!

1037
01:02:08,115 --> 01:02:09,283
How can you say that, Clara?

1038
01:02:09,417 --> 01:02:11,886
You have known him how long, a week?

1039
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,754
Well, I have known him long enough to know

1040
01:02:13,888 --> 01:02:15,456
that he would never hurt Jamie.

1041
01:02:15,589 --> 01:02:17,024
That's his friend.

1042
01:02:17,491 --> 01:02:20,261
Now I believe you might have been fooled, Ms. Collier.

1043
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:24,265
Thomas Jay Moore, convicted of assault, 1994.

1044
01:02:25,499 --> 01:02:27,768
Incarcerated Reedsville State Prison.

1045
01:02:28,202 --> 01:02:29,437
Two years.

1046
01:02:30,004 --> 01:02:32,406
[tense music]

1047
01:02:41,182 --> 01:02:44,452
[birds singing]

1048
01:02:47,054 --> 01:02:48,089
[Clara whispers] Thomas.

1049
01:02:50,357 --> 01:02:52,760
[door creaking]

1050
01:02:59,266 --> 01:03:00,301
Thomas?

1051
01:03:02,703 --> 01:03:04,205
- [tin rattling] - [Clara gasps]

1052
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:09,009
- [tense music] - [footsteps approaching]

1053
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,082
Oh, Detective, you scared me.

1054
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:16,484
Oh, was it me?

1055
01:03:16,617 --> 01:03:18,285
Or the thought that I might be Thomas?

1056
01:03:20,554 --> 01:03:22,857
You know, Ms. Collier, you really shouldn't be here,

1057
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,258
especially by yourself.

1058
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:28,395
I know, I just wanted to look around.

1059
01:03:30,297 --> 01:03:33,167
Well, sometimes you just can't make sense of it.

1060
01:03:35,002 --> 01:03:37,004
Can I give you a ride home?

1061
01:03:39,073 --> 01:03:40,107
No.

1062
01:03:42,009 --> 01:03:44,245
No, I'll be just fine.

1063
01:03:44,945 --> 01:03:46,680
Thank you, Detective, goodbye.

1064
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,716
Ms. Collier?

1065
01:03:48,849 --> 01:03:50,317
Until we get this fella,

1066
01:03:50,985 --> 01:03:52,686
I think you really ought to be more careful.

1067
01:04:02,163 --> 01:04:03,197
[Clara] Thomas?

1068
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,536
Thomas?

1069
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,477
- [tense music] - [Clara gasps]

1070
01:04:16,610 --> 01:04:17,812
Shh, shh!

1071
01:04:18,112 --> 01:04:19,146
What are you doing?

1072
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:21,515
What?

1073
01:04:22,183 --> 01:04:23,217
What?

1074
01:04:25,886 --> 01:04:27,087
No, you stay there.

1075
01:04:30,991 --> 01:04:34,061
Thomas, I think you should go and turn yourself in.

1076
01:04:36,263 --> 01:04:39,300
Come on. You're gonna make it worse than it already is.

1077
01:04:40,701 --> 01:04:43,170
Thomas, Thomas, talk to them.

1078
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:46,407
Why not? Why not?

1079
01:04:48,542 --> 01:04:50,544
Thomas, Thomas!

1080
01:04:54,381 --> 01:04:56,550
- [dramatic music] - [dogs barking]

1081
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:59,019
- [man] Nothing here! - [man 2] Over there,

1082
01:04:59,153 --> 01:05:00,554
signs of life over there.

1083
01:05:01,555 --> 01:05:05,626
- [man] Thomas! - [dogs barking]

1084
01:05:05,759 --> 01:05:07,328
[man 2] Thomas, we need you to come out!

1085
01:05:07,461 --> 01:05:09,096
[dogs barking]

1086
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,134
[man 3] There's a pathway down here.

1087
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:15,336
Come on.

1088
01:05:16,503 --> 01:05:18,405
[dogs barking]

1089
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:21,308
[officers shouting indistinctly]

1090
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,150
[man] Hey, get that light over here for a sec, would you?

1091
01:05:30,351 --> 01:05:31,418
Thomas!

1092
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:34,054
- [man 2] There he is! - [man 3] Freeze!

1093
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,290
Get on your knees!

1094
01:05:38,259 --> 01:05:39,627
Put your hands behind your head!

1095
01:05:40,494 --> 01:05:42,563
[dramatic music]

1096
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:45,099
[man 3] Down on your belly.

1097
01:05:45,232 --> 01:05:46,867
Hurry up and keep your hands still.

1098
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:50,471
[dogs barking]

1099
01:06:18,299 --> 01:06:19,433
- [officer] Sir. - [Professor] Yeah?

1100
01:06:19,566 --> 01:06:20,968
[officer] We found Thomas.

1101
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:23,103
He's been arrested and taken to the station for questioning.

1102
01:06:23,237 --> 01:06:24,471
[Professor] Thank goodness you got him.

1103
01:06:24,605 --> 01:06:26,307
[officer] He tried to escape, but we tracked him down.

1104
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:27,841
- [Professor] Thank you officer. - [officer] Good night.

1105
01:06:27,975 --> 01:06:29,009
[Professor] Good night.

1106
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,150
They've got him in custody.

1107
01:06:47,328 --> 01:06:48,662
You did the right thing, honey.

1108
01:06:53,934 --> 01:06:57,071
Celia put her hands on the tree and said,

1109
01:06:57,304 --> 01:07:00,374
"Please, Mister Tree, please don't let them find me."

1110
01:07:01,041 --> 01:07:03,644
So then, the wishing tree made her wish come true.

1111
01:07:04,578 --> 01:07:07,982
So by the time the mean men got there, she was gone.

1112
01:07:08,282 --> 01:07:12,019
She went up to New York and lived happily ever after.

1113
01:07:12,152 --> 01:07:13,187
The end.

1114
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:15,389
[monitor beeping]

1115
01:07:15,522 --> 01:07:17,891
- Hey, Clara! - Hey, little girl.

1116
01:07:18,225 --> 01:07:21,095
That was a good story you told.

1117
01:07:24,298 --> 01:07:25,332
Clara.

1118
01:07:28,035 --> 01:07:29,069
Thank you.

1119
01:07:37,611 --> 01:07:39,380
- Clara? - Mm?

1120
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:41,448
Is Magic Man in trouble?

1121
01:07:47,988 --> 01:07:49,356
Yes, sweetie, he is.

1122
01:07:49,957 --> 01:07:51,091
But you're a lawyer.

1123
01:07:51,225 --> 01:07:53,827
You can get him out of it, right?

1124
01:07:55,195 --> 01:07:58,265
He didn't do it, Clara. He would never hurt Jamie.

1125
01:07:59,967 --> 01:08:01,902
[somber music]

1126
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,542
[bird screeching]

1127
01:08:10,411 --> 01:08:11,845
[tense music]

1128
01:08:12,012 --> 01:08:13,480
[bird screeching]

1129
01:08:18,419 --> 01:08:20,454
[bird screeching]

1130
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:29,496
Hello.

1131
01:08:31,732 --> 01:08:32,766
Excuse me?

1132
01:08:34,902 --> 01:08:36,904
Officer, I'm here to see Thomas Moore.

1133
01:08:41,875 --> 01:08:42,976
[door shuts]

1134
01:08:44,611 --> 01:08:45,646
Hey, Thomas.

1135
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:47,781
Are they treating you okay?

1136
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,022
Jamie is still in the hospital.

1137
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:57,691
He hasn't regained consciousness.

1138
01:09:00,461 --> 01:09:03,263
Thomas, why aren't you talking to anyone?

1139
01:09:04,731 --> 01:09:07,601
Well, why don't you tell them what happened?

1140
01:09:07,734 --> 01:09:11,839
[Thomas banging on table]

1141
01:09:13,974 --> 01:09:15,142
Okay.

1142
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:17,845
If you would tell them what happened--

1143
01:09:19,246 --> 01:09:20,280
Tell--

1144
01:09:21,215 --> 01:09:24,251
[tense music]

1145
01:09:35,229 --> 01:09:36,463
[Crane] Oh, Ms. Collier.

1146
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,866
Now what brings you down to the station here?

1147
01:09:40,634 --> 01:09:42,302
I came to see my client.

1148
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:43,470
Wait, wait a second.

1149
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,839
You tell me you're representing that man?

1150
01:09:46,540 --> 01:09:47,674
Yes, I am.

1151
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,416
[Wallis sobbing]

1152
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,326
[Clara] I need to talk to you.

1153
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:07,761
We just got the call.

1154
01:10:09,530 --> 01:10:13,000
I don't understand how you can do this to me, Clara.

1155
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:14,168
Let me explain.

1156
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:16,069
No, I don't want an explanation.

1157
01:10:16,203 --> 01:10:18,405
Nothing you're gonna say could make me understand.

1158
01:10:19,173 --> 01:10:21,675
- We don't know what happened. - What happened?

1159
01:10:22,809 --> 01:10:23,977
What happened?

1160
01:10:25,112 --> 01:10:26,747
Jamie went into the woods to visit that man

1161
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:28,315
and now he's not waking up.

1162
01:10:29,583 --> 01:10:30,851
He's not waking up.

1163
01:10:31,552 --> 01:10:33,754
[Wallis crying]

1164
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,525
[Wallis] Oh God.

1165
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,695
[breathing heavily]

1166
01:10:43,130 --> 01:10:44,398
Oh God.

1167
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:45,966
You just--

1168
01:10:46,366 --> 01:10:47,401
Get out.

1169
01:10:50,904 --> 01:10:52,039
Just get out!

1170
01:10:58,011 --> 01:10:59,279
[Wallis crying]

1171
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:01,748
[Wallis] Get out of my house!

1172
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:09,456
[solemn music]

1173
01:11:20,434 --> 01:11:22,970
[dog barking]

1174
01:11:39,620 --> 01:11:41,388
[dog barking]

1175
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:04,711
[bell ringing]

1176
01:12:04,845 --> 01:12:06,246
- [man] Can I help you? - Yes.

1177
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:08,282
I was hoping to find Ray Little.

1178
01:12:08,682 --> 01:12:11,618
He worked here as a pharmacist in '94.

1179
01:12:11,752 --> 01:12:14,121
Yeah, he was. But he moved back up north.

1180
01:12:14,321 --> 01:12:15,355
Maybe I can help you.

1181
01:12:15,822 --> 01:12:18,425
Well, I'm looking for information about a robbery

1182
01:12:18,558 --> 01:12:20,060
that took place here.

1183
01:12:20,227 --> 01:12:22,029
A man named Thomas Moore was involved.

1184
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:24,998
I think I'm the one you should talk to.

1185
01:12:30,771 --> 01:12:34,908
Please, Mister Wishing Tree, make my friend Jamie wake up.

1186
01:12:38,512 --> 01:12:41,548
[eerie music]

1187
01:12:47,721 --> 01:12:49,856
[tense music]

1188
01:13:15,148 --> 01:13:18,518
[Wallis singing indistinctly]

1189
01:13:41,641 --> 01:13:44,244
[bell tolling]

1190
01:13:50,016 --> 01:13:51,385
[officer] You got five minutes.

1191
01:13:52,552 --> 01:13:53,854
[door shuts]

1192
01:13:54,755 --> 01:13:55,889
Hello, Thomas.

1193
01:14:02,195 --> 01:14:03,296
Are you okay?

1194
01:14:05,399 --> 01:14:06,700
It's all right.

1195
01:14:07,401 --> 01:14:11,004
I found out what happened at the pharmacy.

1196
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:15,442
I understand what you're going through,

1197
01:14:15,976 --> 01:14:19,579
and I promise you, I'll get you out of here,

1198
01:14:21,715 --> 01:14:25,051
but you have to help me.

1199
01:14:25,619 --> 01:14:29,790
I need you to tell me exactly what happened.

1200
01:14:33,226 --> 01:14:35,962
[tense music]

1201
01:14:40,967 --> 01:14:42,002
Oh.

1202
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:46,973
It's okay.

1203
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,675
[breathing rapidly]

1204
01:14:50,710 --> 01:14:51,745
It's okay.

1205
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:04,624
[birds singing]

1206
01:15:04,758 --> 01:15:05,792
[Wallis] Will?

1207
01:15:32,452 --> 01:15:35,322
[indistinct chattering]

1208
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:40,327
[gavel banging]

1209
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:45,832
[judge] Mr. Moore, you are charged with kidnapping,

1210
01:15:46,366 --> 01:15:48,535
which is a felony in the state of Georgia.

1211
01:15:49,369 --> 01:15:51,805
The purpose of this hearing is not to determine

1212
01:15:51,938 --> 01:15:54,841
whether you are guilty or not guilty of these charges.

1213
01:15:54,975 --> 01:15:58,678
It is simply to determine whether there is probable cause

1214
01:15:58,812 --> 01:16:02,048
to bind this case over to the district attorney's office

1215
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:03,683
for further investigation.

1216
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:06,353
If I find there is no probable cause,

1217
01:16:06,486 --> 01:16:08,121
you will be released today.

1218
01:16:09,723 --> 01:16:11,057
Do you have any questions

1219
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:13,193
about what I have explained to you?

1220
01:16:13,660 --> 01:16:15,428
No, Your Honor, we're ready to proceed.

1221
01:16:16,496 --> 01:16:19,099
Officer Daniels, would you tell us what happened

1222
01:16:19,232 --> 01:16:21,468
after you placed the victim in your car?

1223
01:16:22,269 --> 01:16:25,405
Well, when I turned back towards the suspect, he was gone.

1224
01:16:26,172 --> 01:16:27,641
You mean he ran away?

1225
01:16:28,141 --> 01:16:29,643
[Daniels] I didn't see him.

1226
01:16:29,910 --> 01:16:31,278
Well yeah, I suppose he did.

1227
01:16:31,411 --> 01:16:32,779
[Clara] Officer Daniels,

1228
01:16:33,346 --> 01:16:35,448
why was your gun drawn when you stepped from the car?

1229
01:16:35,916 --> 01:16:38,618
[Daniels] There was an APB out on a possible kidnapping.

1230
01:16:39,052 --> 01:16:41,121
I assumed the suspect was dangerous.

1231
01:16:42,088 --> 01:16:43,590
He didn't answer my questions.

1232
01:16:43,723 --> 01:16:45,425
[Clara] Do you think there's any possibility

1233
01:16:45,559 --> 01:16:48,228
that my client could have feared for his life?

1234
01:16:49,529 --> 01:16:51,431
I'm a police officer, counselor.

1235
01:16:51,765 --> 01:16:53,266
And what, your bullets don't hurt?

1236
01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:55,068
Ms. Collier.

1237
01:16:55,835 --> 01:16:57,337
No further questions, Your Honor.

1238
01:17:00,740 --> 01:17:04,611
[Clara] Mr. Davies, would you describe him as a violent man?

1239
01:17:04,744 --> 01:17:07,581
[Davies] Oh no, quite the opposite in fact.

1240
01:17:07,948 --> 01:17:09,249
[Clara] Did he ever talk to you?

1241
01:17:09,549 --> 01:17:10,584
[Davies] No, ma'am.

1242
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:13,053
Thomas was born without vocal chords.

1243
01:17:13,853 --> 01:17:15,989
But you are the head pharmacist

1244
01:17:16,122 --> 01:17:18,491
at the very store where Thomas

1245
01:17:18,625 --> 01:17:20,894
supposedly committed a violent robbery.

1246
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,530
Yes, but that's not really what happened.

1247
01:17:23,663 --> 01:17:24,898
Oh?

1248
01:17:25,065 --> 01:17:27,968
Well, would you tell us all what really did happen?

1249
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:29,369
[Davies] Yes.

1250
01:17:29,502 --> 01:17:33,473
Thomas's mother was diagnosed with bone cancer in 1987.

1251
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,476
Within a few months, the illness had taken

1252
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:38,845
just about every penny they had.

1253
01:17:38,979 --> 01:17:41,948
She was in so much pain, Thomas just couldn't bear it.

1254
01:17:42,082 --> 01:17:44,718
He came to the pharmacy to get something to help her.

1255
01:17:44,884 --> 01:17:47,020
Now, if I'd been there, I would just have given it to him.

1256
01:17:47,153 --> 01:17:48,521
I knew he didn't have any money.

1257
01:17:49,055 --> 01:17:51,191
But I'd just hired this new fella, Ray,

1258
01:17:51,324 --> 01:17:52,626
and he didn't understand.

1259
01:17:53,593 --> 01:17:55,962
When he wouldn't give Thomas the medication,

1260
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:57,697
he grabbed for it

1261
01:17:58,298 --> 01:18:00,634
and accidentally, he broke Ray's hand.

1262
01:18:01,935 --> 01:18:03,837
But you pressed charges?

1263
01:18:03,970 --> 01:18:06,139
[Davies] No, I didn't, I had the robbery charge dropped,

1264
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:09,242
but that fella, Ray, went ahead with the assault charge

1265
01:18:09,376 --> 01:18:11,511
on account of his hand being broke.

1266
01:18:12,379 --> 01:18:14,581
So, Thomas went to jail?

1267
01:18:14,714 --> 01:18:16,049
[Davies] Yes, he did.

1268
01:18:17,183 --> 01:18:18,551
And that's when it happened.

1269
01:18:19,119 --> 01:18:20,654
[Clara] What happened?

1270
01:18:20,787 --> 01:18:22,589
[Davies] His mother passed away.

1271
01:18:22,722 --> 01:18:24,557
I know that was hard on Thomas,

1272
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:26,860
not being there when she died.

1273
01:18:26,993 --> 01:18:29,863
After he got out, he moved to the woods.

1274
01:18:30,296 --> 01:18:32,999
Pretty much stopped coming around.

1275
01:18:33,133 --> 01:18:36,536
To tell you the truth, I can't say I blame him.

1276
01:18:36,670 --> 01:18:38,438
[Clara] Detective Crane,

1277
01:18:38,571 --> 01:18:41,207
did you ever find any evidence that a crime

1278
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,842
was committed by my client?

1279
01:18:43,576 --> 01:18:45,412
[Crane] Well, I find it hard to believe

1280
01:18:45,545 --> 01:18:48,415
that Jamie Caldwell beat up on himself, counselor.

1281
01:18:49,282 --> 01:18:52,352
Are you aware that my client was found carrying

1282
01:18:52,485 --> 01:18:55,155
Jamie Caldwell less than four tenths of a mile

1283
01:18:55,288 --> 01:18:57,223
from the Savannah General Hospital?

1284
01:18:57,857 --> 01:18:59,426
[clears throat] No, I wasn't.

1285
01:18:59,726 --> 01:19:02,529
Did it ever occur to you that he might be trying

1286
01:19:02,662 --> 01:19:04,197
to help Jamie Caldwell?

1287
01:19:04,998 --> 01:19:06,366
Well, I find that hard to believe.

1288
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:08,101
Why is that?

1289
01:19:08,968 --> 01:19:11,638
Well, one thing experience has taught me is that,

1290
01:19:12,038 --> 01:19:14,741
innocent people don't run from the law.

1291
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,745
[phone ringing]

1292
01:19:20,246 --> 01:19:21,881
You need to understand something.

1293
01:19:22,615 --> 01:19:24,884
If the judge thinks that there's even the slightest

1294
01:19:25,018 --> 01:19:27,253
possibility that a crime was committed,

1295
01:19:27,387 --> 01:19:29,222
you will be bound over for trial.

1296
01:19:29,355 --> 01:19:31,825
And if that happens, you will remain in jail

1297
01:19:31,958 --> 01:19:33,560
until that trial date.

1298
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,896
Thomas, you can't do this to me.

1299
01:19:37,030 --> 01:19:38,498
I am doing everything I can to help you,

1300
01:19:38,631 --> 01:19:40,100
but you have to help me.

1301
01:19:41,768 --> 01:19:44,637
Listen, I don't know what went on out in those woods,

1302
01:19:44,771 --> 01:19:47,073
but I know that whatever it was, it was not your fault.

1303
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:48,842
I know that, but they don't.

1304
01:19:48,975 --> 01:19:50,844
Only you can tell them that!

1305
01:19:55,648 --> 01:19:58,685
Your Honor, the defense calls Thomas Moore.

1306
01:20:20,540 --> 01:20:23,977
Mr. Moore, please place your right hand on the Bible.

1307
01:20:25,578 --> 01:20:26,780
Raise your left hand.

1308
01:20:27,981 --> 01:20:29,816
Do you swear to tell the truth,

1309
01:20:29,949 --> 01:20:32,252
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1310
01:20:33,653 --> 01:20:34,687
You may sit down.

1311
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:55,642
Mr. Moore, I only have a few questions.

1312
01:20:58,244 --> 01:20:59,813
Are you acquainted with a young boy

1313
01:20:59,946 --> 01:21:02,048
by the name of Jamie Caldwell?

1314
01:21:11,624 --> 01:21:12,992
Thomas, look at me.

1315
01:21:16,896 --> 01:21:19,332
Are you acquainted with Jamie Caldwell?

1316
01:21:21,467 --> 01:21:22,502
[interpreter] Yes.

1317
01:21:23,803 --> 01:21:26,172
How would you describe your relationship?

1318
01:21:28,041 --> 01:21:29,709
He's my friend.

1319
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:32,512
So, you care very deeply for him, don't you?

1320
01:21:34,747 --> 01:21:35,782
[interpreter] Yes.

1321
01:21:36,015 --> 01:21:37,350
Tell me, Mr. Moore.

1322
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:40,119
Were you invited on August fourth to a party at the home

1323
01:21:40,286 --> 01:21:41,521
of the Albert Brooks's?

1324
01:21:42,822 --> 01:21:43,823
Yes.

1325
01:21:44,524 --> 01:21:46,125
And did you go to that party?

1326
01:21:48,394 --> 01:21:49,662
No.

1327
01:21:49,929 --> 01:21:50,964
[Clara] Why not?

1328
01:21:52,732 --> 01:21:56,069
- [interpreter] I was afraid. - You were afraid?

1329
01:21:56,302 --> 01:21:59,105
But why were you afraid to go to a party?

1330
01:22:00,673 --> 01:22:01,708
[interpreter] Look at me.

1331
01:22:03,409 --> 01:22:06,279
Look at how everyone looks at me.

1332
01:22:07,113 --> 01:22:09,716
I was afraid of being judged.

1333
01:22:12,685 --> 01:22:15,555
They don't understand me.

1334
01:22:15,688 --> 01:22:18,625
It hurts too much.

1335
01:22:21,027 --> 01:22:22,929
Does that make you angry, Thomas?

1336
01:22:24,530 --> 01:22:28,268
[interpreter] No, makes me very sad.

1337
01:22:30,136 --> 01:22:33,306
Thomas, did you know that your friend,

1338
01:22:33,439 --> 01:22:36,776
Jamie Caldwell, ran into the woods to look for you,

1339
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:39,412
because he wanted you to come to that party?

1340
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:43,449
[interpreter] No, not until I heard him calling me.

1341
01:22:44,284 --> 01:22:46,185
[dramatic music]

1342
01:22:46,319 --> 01:22:48,121
Magic Man!

1343
01:22:50,623 --> 01:22:53,259
- [thunder cracking] - [Jamie] Magic Man!

1344
01:22:55,995 --> 01:22:57,430
Magic Man!

1345
01:22:58,064 --> 01:22:59,666
[thunder cracking]

1346
01:22:59,899 --> 01:23:01,367
[Jamie screaming]

1347
01:23:04,070 --> 01:23:06,839
[music continues]

1348
01:23:16,349 --> 01:23:19,118
[exhaling dramatically]

1349
01:23:28,761 --> 01:23:31,130
- [tires screech] - [siren wails]

1350
01:23:32,665 --> 01:23:34,200
[Daniels] Stop right where you are.

1351
01:23:35,568 --> 01:23:37,704
Just put the boy on the ground, right now.

1352
01:23:38,471 --> 01:23:40,239
Put the boy on the ground!

1353
01:23:40,673 --> 01:23:41,708
Do it!

1354
01:23:47,914 --> 01:23:52,018
I was trying, trying to help him,

1355
01:23:53,753 --> 01:23:59,025
but I failed, I failed again.

1356
01:24:02,462 --> 01:24:04,330
I'm so sorry.

1357
01:24:05,398 --> 01:24:11,404
More sorry than you will ever know.

1358
01:24:16,609 --> 01:24:18,344
You didn't fail, Thomas.

1359
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:22,715
We failed you.

1360
01:24:31,557 --> 01:24:34,927
You see, a lot of times,

1361
01:24:35,561 --> 01:24:38,664
we don't understand people who are unlike us.

1362
01:24:40,666 --> 01:24:43,436
And rather than trying to understand,

1363
01:24:43,569 --> 01:24:44,937
we simply reject them.

1364
01:24:46,039 --> 01:24:48,207
I don't know what we are so afraid of.

1365
01:24:48,341 --> 01:24:51,377
Perhaps we fear that through association,

1366
01:24:51,511 --> 01:24:53,179
we too might be judged.

1367
01:24:56,616 --> 01:24:59,085
We hear you, Thomas.

1368
01:24:59,218 --> 01:25:00,653
You didn't fail your mother,

1369
01:25:02,221 --> 01:25:05,958
and you didn't fail your friend, Jamie Caldwell.

1370
01:25:10,763 --> 01:25:12,965
Looking at the facts of this case,

1371
01:25:14,167 --> 01:25:17,737
I have come to the conclusion that we should not be here,

1372
01:25:17,870 --> 01:25:19,605
judging Thomas Moore.

1373
01:25:21,607 --> 01:25:23,309
We should be apologizing.

1374
01:25:25,478 --> 01:25:27,180
I find no probable cause.

1375
01:25:27,313 --> 01:25:28,881
- [gavel bangs] - Case dismissed.

1376
01:25:31,217 --> 01:25:32,251
Yeah.

1377
01:25:35,288 --> 01:25:38,157
[gentle music]

1378
01:25:39,459 --> 01:25:40,493
Good job.

1379
01:25:50,036 --> 01:25:52,271
It's Jamie, he wants to see Jamie.

1380
01:25:55,341 --> 01:25:56,809
- Come. - I can't thank you enough

1381
01:25:56,943 --> 01:25:57,977
for coming.

1382
01:25:58,111 --> 01:26:00,847
[indistinct chattering]

1383
01:26:02,949 --> 01:26:04,383
[gentle piano music]

1384
01:26:04,517 --> 01:26:08,654
[woman speaking indistinctly over PA]

1385
01:26:11,424 --> 01:26:12,925
Magic Man!

1386
01:26:25,171 --> 01:26:28,307
[solemn music]

1387
01:27:10,850 --> 01:27:13,686
[music continues]

1388
01:27:27,133 --> 01:27:28,701
[Professor] Now magic can sometimes

1389
01:27:28,834 --> 01:27:30,269
take a little while to work.

1390
01:27:31,737 --> 01:27:34,774
In this case, it was about two hours

1391
01:27:34,907 --> 01:27:39,912
after Magic Man left that Jamie finally opened his eyes.

1392
01:27:41,180 --> 01:27:43,983
I think it's because I found the wishing tree.

1393
01:27:44,150 --> 01:27:45,251
Well, if you found it,

1394
01:27:45,384 --> 01:27:47,753
then how come you don't show it to us?

1395
01:27:48,321 --> 01:27:50,223
Because I forgot to mark it.

1396
01:27:50,356 --> 01:27:52,258
[Professor chuckles]

1397
01:27:52,758 --> 01:27:54,260
[Clara laughs]

1398
01:28:04,036 --> 01:28:06,205
I thought you said we weren't going far.

1399
01:28:06,339 --> 01:28:08,808
[gentle music]

1400
01:28:10,443 --> 01:28:11,611
We're here.

1401
01:28:14,380 --> 01:28:15,414
The tree?

1402
01:28:16,215 --> 01:28:18,251
Yeah, it is, it's very big.

1403
01:28:18,884 --> 01:28:21,220
It must be over several hundred years old.

1404
01:28:26,993 --> 01:28:29,629
[music continues]

1405
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:38,271
What are you doing?

1406
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,608
[mysterious music]

1407
01:28:49,382 --> 01:28:50,483
What is that?

1408
01:28:51,951 --> 01:28:53,119
A bullet?

1409
01:28:54,920 --> 01:28:57,890
No. Why would anybody go shoot up a tree?

1410
01:29:06,932 --> 01:29:08,067
You think?

1411
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:15,041
The wishing tree.

1412
01:29:17,843 --> 01:29:20,379
[music continues]

1413
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:34,760
What, you want me to make a wish?

1414
01:29:39,465 --> 01:29:43,002
[gentle music]

1415
01:30:06,926 --> 01:30:08,260
- [man] Clara? - Mm?

1416
01:30:08,761 --> 01:30:10,096
This just arrived for you.

1417
01:30:11,997 --> 01:30:13,032
What is it?

1418
01:30:13,399 --> 01:30:14,967
There's no return address.

1419
01:30:17,903 --> 01:30:19,038
- Wait. - What?

1420
01:30:19,372 --> 01:30:20,406
What if it's a bomb?

1421
01:30:20,539 --> 01:30:21,874
Oh, Kevin, please.

1422
01:30:22,041 --> 01:30:23,509
Who's gonna send me a bomb?

1423
01:30:23,642 --> 01:30:25,044
Well, Clara, you're a lawyer.

1424
01:30:25,177 --> 01:30:26,212
You want a list?

1425
01:30:27,747 --> 01:30:30,416
Oh, oh!

1426
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:31,917
Who is that?

1427
01:30:33,285 --> 01:30:34,320
That's my mother.

1428
01:30:36,255 --> 01:30:37,757
He knew my mother.

1429
01:30:38,958 --> 01:30:41,761
[gentle music]

1430
01:30:53,706 --> 01:30:57,109
[Clara] As I looked at that beautiful carving,

1431
01:30:57,243 --> 01:31:01,247
I realized I finally understood,

1432
01:31:03,916 --> 01:31:07,286
that Thomas in many ways was like the man my mother

1433
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:11,157
used to talk about, the one who lived out in the woods.

1434
01:31:11,290 --> 01:31:16,829
You see, when I got lost, he brought me back home.

1435
01:31:18,564 --> 01:31:22,568
And that is where this story ends.

1436
01:31:24,336 --> 01:31:26,639
[Alexa] Wait a second. What you wish for at the tree?

1437
01:31:26,772 --> 01:31:27,807
[child] Yeah.

1438
01:31:28,407 --> 01:31:30,142
Oh, what do you think I wished for?

1439
01:31:30,276 --> 01:31:31,343
[Alexa] I don't know.

1440
01:31:31,710 --> 01:31:32,978
What did you wish for?

1441
01:31:33,779 --> 01:31:35,347
What do you think I wished for?

1442
01:31:37,349 --> 01:31:39,785
You wished you could go back in the forest?

1443
01:31:42,488 --> 01:31:46,926
[Jamie] I think you wished that you could be magic,

1444
01:31:47,259 --> 01:31:49,195
like Magic Man.

1445
01:31:49,328 --> 01:31:50,830
Jamie, you wouldn't need magic

1446
01:31:50,963 --> 01:31:52,765
if you're friends with Magic Man.

1447
01:31:53,165 --> 01:31:55,134
- [child] That's right. - I think I'd wish

1448
01:31:55,267 --> 01:31:56,302
I could fly.

1449
01:31:56,569 --> 01:31:58,771
[child] Yeah, so would I.

1450
01:31:59,438 --> 01:32:00,706
Know what I'd wish for?

1451
01:32:04,777 --> 01:32:06,545
I'd wish your mother could see you now.

1452
01:32:12,685 --> 01:32:15,187
Well, I'm not gonna tell you what I wished for,

1453
01:32:16,522 --> 01:32:17,957
but it did come true.

1454
01:32:19,658 --> 01:32:21,861
[gentle music]

1455
01:32:22,995 --> 01:32:26,065
And with or without the wishing tree,

1456
01:32:27,233 --> 01:32:30,202
if you believe, yours will too.

1457
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:37,443
Cherish it.

1458
01:32:47,853 --> 01:32:51,290
[bright music]
