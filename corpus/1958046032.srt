1
00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:02,961
[bright music]

2
00:00:13,054 --> 00:00:15,932
[cheery music]

3
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:17,600
All right, everyone,
settle down.

4
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:18,893
We're almost done.

5
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,271
I know you've all
been waiting to hear

6
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,440
who I've chosen
for the promotion

7
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,151
and I'm here to
confirm the rumours.

8
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,235
That's right,

9
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:30,447
our very own
king of commerce,

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,365
Kent Hammer,

11
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:37,078
is our new financial
analysis revenue technician!

12
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,079
[clapping]

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:41,291
Kent:
Boom! Let's go baby!

14
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:44,085
Boss:
Hammer, your outstanding work
and passion to Bonk Corp

15
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:48,173
have been proven
time and time again.

16
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:51,468
We on the board are very
excited to see you move up

17
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,636
and start this
new life journey.

18
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:54,679
Just need you to, uh-

19
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,889
[smashing]

20
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:59,100
...take care of a little
paperwork to get you started.

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,479
I need everything reviewed and
signed by the end of the day.

22
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,189
That won't be a problem,
will it?

23
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,440
No problem at all.

24
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:09,486
Yeah, I'll-I'll nail all that
paperwork, uh, before lunch.

25
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,322
I mean, you're-you're
looking at the Hammer [laughs].

26
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,698
Boss:
The Hammer!

27
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,200
That's the spirit.

28
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:16,493
Direct the accounts...

29
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,994
Briefcase:
[whispering] Psst!

30
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:20,079
Hey! Congrats Kent!

31
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,998
I knew you could do it.

32
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:22,999
Oh!

33
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:25,210
That being said, uh,
meeting adjourned.

34
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:29,506
Uh, Hammer be sure to have
those papers within the hour,

35
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,381
you're starting a
new position today.

36
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:34,093
You're fine with working
overtime, right?

37
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:35,845
Of course!

38
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,222
Yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm the Hammer.

39
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,766
True workhorse.

40
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,185
You're an inspiration
to all of us.

41
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:46,523
Keep this up and I see another
promo in the next ten years!

42
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,066
[echoing] Ten years.
Ten years.

43
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,860
This is great, huh, Kent?!

44
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,989
Financial analyst revenue tech!

45
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:55,990
[sighs]

46
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,536
Hey buddy, you're not
looking like yourself.

47
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,704
Maybe you should start
taking your medicine again

48
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,707
to level you out through
this promotion, hmm?

49
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,084
Remember the last time you
worked a ton of overtime?

50
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,338
Here, I've got 'em
right around somewhere.

51
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,381
Yeah you're right,

52
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,217
some of this stuff
sounds stressful as fuck.

53
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,886
Ah, either way my
medication's in the car.

54
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,054
Old news!

55
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,723
Forget pills, we're
talking bills, baby.

56
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:23,184
What it feels like is
we're getting a new ride!

57
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:26,938
You need to add a few zeros on
that salary proposal, punchy.

58
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,731
Oh, maybe I could
make a few changes

59
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:32,068
to the salary and
budgeting here,

60
00:02:32,151 --> 00:02:33,278
and here.

61
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,279
[stabbing noises]

62
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:35,280
Cut it out!

63
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,447
That's what I'm saying.

64
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:37,740
We're in management
now baby!

65
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,367
You saw how Jeff
was looking at you.

66
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,785
They're jealous!

67
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:41,536
Cut them out, remember?

68
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,204
Gotta look out
for number one!

69
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,789
We don't need anyone,

70
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,374
you're the Hammer, baby!

71
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,585
Yeah, fuck off Jeff.

72
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,420
Just look at those hours.

73
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,089
I'm gonna be your best
friend after this one!

74
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,591
Remember we're
working overtime,

75
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,092
so don't forget to fill up.

76
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,552
Maybe just need
a cup or two.

77
00:02:57,635 --> 00:02:58,303
Or inject me into
your bloodstream.

78
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,304
Who cares?

79
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:01,764
Yeah. You know,
a little pick me up

80
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,016
it's not gonna
kill me, right?

81
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,309
I mean, these-these-these
overtime hours

82
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,226
are busting my dick off.

83
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,979
Hours equal money.

84
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,606
Cash money, Kent.

85
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,399
Money makes the
world go round!

86
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,609
Mm-hmm.

87
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,611
Kent, don't listen
to these guys.

88
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,737
You're gonna do great.

89
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,614
I'm on your side, buddy.
We should-

90
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,574
Now hang on a second.
Are you?!

91
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:22,619
Because all I've heard from
you is-is-is pills this and

92
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,495
[in whiny voice] "take
your medicine Kent".

93
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,331
Hey, Kent, uh,

94
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,792
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I'm on your side.

95
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:31,294
I do have a
tiny suggestion.

96
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,130
We should staple
your dickhole shut.

97
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:34,589
I think it'll really help.

98
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:35,340
What the fuck?

99
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,634
No, I, no, no,
no, no no, dude,

100
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:38,468
I'm-I'm already behind, okay?

101
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,304
I don't-I don't
have time for that.

102
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,141
You don't want to be
obsolete, Hammer.

103
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:48,102
As soon as you sign that,
they'll throw you away.

104
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:50,104
Like all those before you.

105
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,649
I know.

106
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,192
Remember David
from accounting?

107
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:55,360
Couldn't keep up.

108
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,195
Wife left him and then
they terminated him

109
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,113
after twenty years
of hard work.

110
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,406
I do remember that.

111
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,369
I'll just add a
termination clause in here.

112
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:07,163
Kent, you know that
stuff's not true!

113
00:04:07,246 --> 00:04:08,665
I know you don't want
to hear this buddy,

114
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,167
but maybe we should
take a little break.

115
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,669
We could go grab lunch.

116
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:15,213
I think there's pizza
in the break room today!

117
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,381
Maybe that'll cheer you up!

118
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,466
The only thing that
will cheer me up

119
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,385
is-is finishing this
goddamn paperwork!

120
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,553
Attention!

121
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,597
[phone ringing]

122
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,474
Kent Hammer speaking.

123
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,143
Office Phone:
Hey Kent, it's your boss.

124
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,479
I need signatures
immediately.

125
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:36,025
You know your job title
spells f-f-fart, right?

126
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,819
[laughing]

127
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:42,407
[ominous music]

128
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:47,036
Loss and gain are
the same, Hammer.

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,582
The world is a never ending
push pull of compromises.

130
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:52,917
Cut! Cut! Cut!

131
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,669
C'mon Kent lets
cut this deal

132
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,713
and then we can cut Jeff!

133
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,423
You're about to get
put through the grinder

134
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,717
and creamed if you
don't finish this stuff.

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,427
Not yet he's not, Instant!

136
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,636
Gotta make money.

137
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,513
Get bills, get paid.

138
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:06,514
Be a man,

139
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:07,515
then he can die.

140
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:11,227
Obsolete! Obsolete! Obsolete!

141
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:12,895
Kent please! We're slipping-

142
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,896
Yoohoo!

143
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,897
Kent darling!

144
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:17,567
Remember me?
Your loving wife.

145
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,236
You've been at the
office so long today!

146
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,320
The kids and I miss you.

147
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,364
Look how much
they're growing.

148
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:24,282
[teeth chattering]

149
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,534
Kent, buddy.

150
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,078
Come on man,
you can't do this alone!

151
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:31,539
This pressure is messing
with your brain.

152
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,707
You're right.

153
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,334
This is way too much.

154
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,378
We should leave work
a little early today!

155
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,464
You know, get out of the
office and relax a little.

156
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,091
I'll think of something
to tell your boss

157
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:46,471
and we can think about all this
wacky promotion stuff later.

158
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,765
You see these charts Hammer?

159
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,308
They ain't gonna
direct themselves.

160
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,601
Your life is over.

161
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:52,727
I'll spell it out for ya,

162
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,395
Mr. Financial Analyst
Revenue Tech.

163
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:59,776
We own you. We own you.
We own you.

164
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,571
We own you. We own you.
We own you.

165
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,491
[gasps] Kent, we don't
have to do this!

166
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,452
This is your last chance.

167
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:11,788
Think about what
you're doing!

168
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,497
You're gonna sign
your life away!

169
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:16,793
Reconsider, please.

170
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:23,591
[sombre music]

171
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,009
[knocking on door]

172
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,804
Kent? Are you almost done
with all that paperwork?

173
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,597
I've been waiting
all morning for-

174
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:36,604
[tense dramatic music]

175
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:41,818
Ah...I'll, uh, just come
back after lunch then.

176
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:42,485
[uncomfortable chuckle]

177
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,990
[bright music]
