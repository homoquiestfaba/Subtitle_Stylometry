1
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:31,432
( cat meows )

2
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:06,434
This one's unlocked.

3
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:27,288
( telephone rings )

4
00:01:27,288 --> 00:01:29,723
Willis and Martha can't 
 come to the phone now.

5
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:32,226
Please leave a message.

6
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,627
( beep )

7
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:36,330
Hey, Willis, 
 it's your wake-up call.

8
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,099
Willis, get up. 
 Are you listening to me?

9
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,301
Huh?

10
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,502
See you in the bubble.

11
00:01:41,502 --> 00:01:43,304
Yeah, o.k.

12
00:01:43,304 --> 00:01:46,340
( tape rewinding )

13
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,609
( woman's voice )
 Willis, I'd tell you 
 this in person,

14
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:51,879
but as you say, 
 I have a fear 
 of confrontation.

15
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:54,615
I'm leaving you. 
 I need to find myself,

16
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:57,185
and traveling around 
 the world is the answer.

17
00:01:57,185 --> 00:02:00,354
So I took the $5,000 
 from your account.

18
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,689
I'll pay you back 
 when I can.

19
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:03,457
I hope you're not mad.

20
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,493
Since you're 
 a psychologist, 
 you'll understand

21
00:02:05,493 --> 00:02:08,696
this is nothing personal, 
 just something I have to do.

22
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,264
Goodbye.

23
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:11,865
( beep )

24
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:42,896
( car engine starts )

25
00:02:56,444 --> 00:02:58,746
You're late.

26
00:02:58,746 --> 00:03:03,751
So shoot me
and put me out
of my misery.

27
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:06,387
( click )
Aah!

28
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,889
Heh heh heh heh.

29
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,591
You're crazy.
You know that?

30
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:12,960
Is that
your professional opinion?

31
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,695
Heh heh heh heh.

32
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,397
You should've
seen your face.

33
00:03:16,397 --> 00:03:19,267
Ha ha ha ha!

34
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,534
Opening one.

35
00:03:20,534 --> 00:03:22,470
Ha ha ha ha!

36
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,206
Ha ha ha ha!

37
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,642
This do anything
for anybody?

38
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,212
Lyle?

39
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:33,647
I was up all night.
Ask Harry.

40
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:36,617
You weren't up all night.
You snored all night.

41
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,918
O.K., anybody?

42
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,920
Give it up.
Nobody wants
to be here.

43
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,790
Well, maybe that's why
they call it prison.

44
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,224
If you were
a better shrink,

45
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,794
we'd all be
out by now.

46
00:03:46,794 --> 00:03:49,830
Aha! O.K., there's
something right there.

47
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:52,900
Now, what's
he doing, huh?

48
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,271
Come on, everybody.
He's blaming his problems
on somebody else.

49
00:03:57,271 --> 00:03:59,807
Somebody else put us
in here, Willis.

50
00:03:59,807 --> 00:04:02,543
If you were good,
you'd be on Park Avenue

51
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:04,945
listening to some
rich bitch's sex life.

52
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:07,681
Not all therapists
are into money.

53
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:09,249
Only assholes
don't want money.

54
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,584
You can be happy
without money.

55
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,887
You happy?
You look like shit.

56
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:16,457
Thank you. Today is
an exception, O.K.?

57
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,459
My girlfriend
moved out on me.

58
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,361
Oh.
Aw!
Ooh!

59
00:04:20,361 --> 00:04:22,296
I can get
her legs broke.

60
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,764
Hey, put that away.

61
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,766
( glass shatters )

62
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,267
Take it easy!

63
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,002
The guy's heart's broke.

64
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,308
I got a theory
about your temper.

65
00:04:34,308 --> 00:04:37,277
You're trying to be tougher
than your brother.

66
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,579
He is.

67
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:39,880
I met his brother.

68
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,415
He's chicken shit.

69
00:04:41,415 --> 00:04:43,551
Just because
you had college
for four months

70
00:04:43,551 --> 00:04:45,486
doesn't make you
a genius!

71
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:48,055
Can we talk about
something else,
please?

72
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,924
You going to
pick up that glass?

73
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,627
Here. Tell us
what you see.

74
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:55,396
O.K.

75
00:04:57,998 --> 00:05:00,501
Well, I see
a bunch of guys

76
00:05:00,501 --> 00:05:05,373
trying to avoid
talking about themselves.

77
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:06,974
( coughing )

78
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,948
Tricks, you O.K.?

79
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:18,652
Oh, this cancer's
starting to win.

80
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,954
The doctor said two weeks,
maybe three.

81
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,890
Oh, God, I heard.

82
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:29,363
There. Just don't
burn down the place.

83
00:05:29,363 --> 00:05:32,633
I want to tell you
a story.

84
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:36,537
It's about a job
five of us pulled
back in '57.

85
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:40,808
We ripped off the mob
for $8 1/2 million.

86
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:43,110
I want you to go get it.

87
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,513
( coughs )

88
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:49,550
Wait a minute.
You're talking about
stolen money, right?

89
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,553
Willis, it was stolen
even before we took it.

90
00:05:52,553 --> 00:05:54,488
Came from
a casino skim bank.

91
00:05:54,488 --> 00:05:56,490
You know what that is.

92
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,025
Oh...yeah.

93
00:05:58,025 --> 00:06:00,994
I'm the only one alive
who knows where the money is.

94
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,763
You're my best friend.

95
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:05,666
I want you to go
and get it.

96
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,134
Keep half for yourself

97
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:10,103
and give half
to Louise Bump.

98
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,541
Here...sweet Louise.

99
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,808
She still writes to me.

100
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:17,645
Oh, good. Let me
think about it.

101
00:06:17,645 --> 00:06:18,846
Don't think about it.

102
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,047
Do it.

103
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,750
Don't be stuck
in this dead-end job.

104
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,519
Do something real
for once.

105
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,792
Dig down 7 feet

106
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,394
in the basement of a house
in Cherry Hill.

107
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:36,096
It was new then.

108
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:39,667
Jack Sausegal's
concrete company
did the neighborhood.

109
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:43,070
He poured a foundation
over it the same day.

110
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:48,509
He drew three circles
in a triangle
in the cement.

111
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:50,143
Dig there.

112
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:58,418
73...22...

113
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,788
Pleasant Street.

114
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:03,491
Willis...

115
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,826
this is my last request.

116
00:07:23,677 --> 00:07:26,213
732...4

117
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:31,184
Oh!

118
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,154
You promised it to me
on our anniversary!

119
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,657
I did not. You're lying!
I did not!

120
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,158
Yes, you did!

121
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:40,160
I never--

122
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,062
No!

123
00:07:48,001 --> 00:07:50,871
( bells ring )

124
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:52,940
We'll never finish
our book at this rate.

125
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,709
How can we work
when they're screaming?

126
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:58,211
Maybe sitting at
our desks would help.

127
00:07:58,211 --> 00:07:59,947
We still need a title.

128
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:02,950
Maybe something with
the word "sex" in it.

129
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,919
Look at Jessie's house.
What's he saying?

130
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,821
Lydia,
I don't read lips.

131
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,222
Oh, now she's crying.

132
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,625
He's a bastard.
Give me those!

133
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:13,093
We should be working.

134
00:08:13,093 --> 00:08:14,728
You started this.

135
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:19,032
Norm and Peedi
are having
cold cereal again.

136
00:08:19,032 --> 00:08:20,968
Talk about boring.

137
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,271
Chews
with his mouth open.

138
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,273
Swallow that, Norm.
My God.

139
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:27,941
Ouch.

140
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:31,278
He's going
to murder her.
He's got a chain saw!

141
00:08:31,278 --> 00:08:32,980
I'll call the police.

142
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,682
Call Marty Rollins.

143
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:37,551
Marty the realtor?
Why him?

144
00:08:37,551 --> 00:08:38,786
( arguing continues )

145
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:41,655
I'm calling the police.

146
00:08:41,655 --> 00:08:44,925
This spoon is dirty,
Peedi.

147
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,128
I don't think we should
get involved, pumpkin.

148
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:51,264
Thank you.

149
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52,866
Mm-hmm.

150
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,068
Let Jeffrey and Lydia
handle it.

151
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:58,572
They're probably monitoring
the whole thing anyway.

152
00:08:58,572 --> 00:09:01,742
Aah!

153
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:02,943
Aah!

154
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,945
No! No!
Aah!

155
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,880
Oh, no!

156
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,982
Aah!
Aah!

157
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,918
You wanted half,

158
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:12,285
you got your half!

159
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:14,955
I cut. You choose.

160
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,790
You're a psychopath!

161
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,693
Any man who could destroy
a beautiful piano--

162
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,294
( doorbell chimes )

163
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,038
Albert,
meet the Colangelos--

164
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,106
Jim, Jean,
Jerry,

165
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,142
and Jillian.

166
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,579
So, Jessie
here?

167
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,915
Ha! Hi,
Jess, babe.

168
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:45,619
We'll start
in the breezeway
and work our way back.

169
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:48,088
By the way, that is
a rare split piano.

170
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:51,859
It's going to
the Museum of Modern Art
next month.

171
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:55,729
I'll show you
a breakfast nook that'll
take your breath away.

172
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,030
Come this way.

173
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,932
That is
a beautiful dress.

174
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:00,600
I love the color.

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,203
It brings out the blue
in your eyes.

176
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:04,705
Jess, babe?

177
00:10:04,705 --> 00:10:06,774
How could you
use Marty Rollins?

178
00:10:06,774 --> 00:10:09,142
He hasn't
sold a house
in three years!

179
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:11,645
And he's
a sex fiend.

180
00:10:11,645 --> 00:10:14,648
Some of us are loyal
to our friends.

181
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:17,217
Besides, he's getting help
for his problem.

182
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:18,986
No. He's beyond help.

183
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:20,387
He's a maniac!

184
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,122
Look who's talking.

185
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:31,965
( electrical buzzing )

186
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:34,101
Huh?

187
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:35,903
Aah!

188
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,202
You done
your homework,
Marvin.

189
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:11,171
Like my mama taught me.

190
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:15,008
You take care
of Willis Embry?

191
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:16,276
Uh, that's for sure.

192
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:29,156
Ohh!

193
00:11:31,058 --> 00:11:32,893
( paper bag rips )

194
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:43,436
Oh...

195
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,405
Shit!

196
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:52,379
Aah!

197
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:02,322
( sirens )

198
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:08,128
I saw him go upstairs
with his groceries.

199
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,930
I'm sure he was inside.

200
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,364
He was always inside.

201
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:13,901
Lady, there was
nothing identifiable
in that room.

202
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,236
He was a good neighbor,
never bothered anyone.

203
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:18,505
That's because he had
a very boring life.

204
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,273
When he sang
in the shower--

205
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,474
What a horrible voice!

206
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:24,945
That's not grounds
for murder, though.

207
00:12:24,945 --> 00:12:28,048
Ask Norm if I should
up my asking price

208
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,950
to offset the lower
interest rate.

209
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:34,254
Uh, should Jessie
up her asking price

210
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,455
to offset...

211
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,024
the interest rate?

212
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:40,027
That'll increase
the value of our
place, muffin.

213
00:12:40,027 --> 00:12:41,361
Tell her yes.

214
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:42,830
Yes.

215
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,064
How much?

216
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,233
I'll ask him.

217
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,801
Let me talk to him.

218
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:51,972
Oh, Jess, he just
went to, uh, work.

219
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:54,274
7-3-2-0, right?

220
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:56,443
Yeah.
Are you sure?

221
00:12:56,443 --> 00:13:00,080
Yeah, I'm sure.
73-20. Drive in here.

222
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,488
All right.

223
00:13:08,488 --> 00:13:12,325
Now, gentlemen,
I don't remember
asking--huh?

224
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:14,394
Shut your trap.

225
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,871
How's that tape
working out?

226
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:27,274
Fine. Just the
thought of exercise
makes me tired.

227
00:13:27,274 --> 00:13:29,242
Oh, now,
you're just depressed.

228
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,211
Things will get better.
Really.

229
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:34,414
Why doesn't anyone
on that tape sweat?

230
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,884
Maybe it doesn't
photograph well.

231
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:38,085
How about you?

232
00:13:38,085 --> 00:13:39,819
I just wear
the clothes.

233
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,021
You're making
a mistake!

234
00:13:41,021 --> 00:13:42,489
I got to go.

235
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,024
Let me tell you
something--

236
00:13:44,024 --> 00:13:45,458
Try sh--

237
00:13:48,128 --> 00:13:50,230
P-p-please...
that's a Fabrizzi.

238
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,431
Oh, yeah?

239
00:13:51,431 --> 00:13:52,933
They finished it off.

240
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,201
What do you mean?

241
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,036
The basement.
It's a rumpus room.

242
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59,006
They got
a big-screen TV,
jukebox, VCR.

243
00:13:59,006 --> 00:14:00,840
Any good tapes?

244
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,976
Gone with the Wind, 
 Last Picture Show, 
 Casablanca--

245
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,611
Casablanca?

246
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:06,846
Is your version
black and white
or colorized?

247
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,150
I think Ted Turner is
making a big mistake,
don't you?

248
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:13,253
The floor!
What's on
the floor?

249
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:15,022
Linoleum. I think
it's Armstrong.

250
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,324
Rip it up. Mmm!
Mmm!

251
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,526
Shut your mouth!
Mmm mff mmm!

252
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,461
Shut up!

253
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:24,497
Just as soon
shoot you
as look at you.

254
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,366
Is he always
this edgy?

255
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,201
Take a look at this.

256
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:30,503
I did not think
he'd kill him.

257
00:14:30,503 --> 00:14:32,505
I really have to
talk to him, Lyle.

258
00:14:32,505 --> 00:14:34,908
Hey, I wouldn't
do that.

259
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:37,544
He's very sensitive
about being
criticized.

260
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,113
He's on medication.

261
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,815
Did you put down
that linoleum?

262
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,284
Mmm mff hmmf...

263
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:48,255
Ma'am, did you see
three circles
in the cement?

264
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,556
And
a triangle?

265
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,024
Uh-uh.

266
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:54,327
We can rip up the whole
goddamn floor.

267
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:56,463
We don't know
anything about--

268
00:14:56,463 --> 00:15:00,267
I can't understand
you, mush mouth.
Speak up.

269
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:03,070
We don't know anything
about circles.

270
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,271
You liar.

271
00:15:04,271 --> 00:15:05,572
Hey, Marvin,
Marvin, easy.

272
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:08,241
Now, we can
use them.

273
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:14,347
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

274
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,584
Marvin,
just look at this--

275
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,119
Thank you.

276
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:23,590
Don't contradict
me in front
of the hostages.

277
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,292
I didn't.

278
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:28,028
You know,
it's embarrassing.

279
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,596
I'm about to
bash somebody,

280
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,299
you tell me not to.

281
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:34,667
It makes me
insecure.

282
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:37,004
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:39,439
Ffm hht mmm mmm...
Shh!

284
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,309
Don't make me look bad
in front of them.

285
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,312
If the mailman notices
they're turning
black and blue,

286
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:47,614
the cops will be
all over us.

287
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:50,317
It's not easy...

288
00:15:50,317 --> 00:15:53,320
you know,
having all this
responsibility.

289
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,621
It's not easy.

290
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:57,090
Now let's go
back in there.

291
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:00,627
Let's get them
on our side, big fella!

292
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:02,996
Don't ever hit me
like that.

293
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:06,299
Out...

294
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:09,069
touch in.

295
00:16:09,069 --> 00:16:11,238
Half-circles.

296
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:12,439
Big arms.

297
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,674
Again. Out...

298
00:16:14,674 --> 00:16:16,676
and in.

299
00:16:16,676 --> 00:16:20,113
Half-circles.

300
00:16:20,113 --> 00:16:22,182
Step-touch.

301
00:16:36,763 --> 00:16:38,698
Front again.

302
00:16:41,401 --> 00:16:43,036
To the side.

303
00:16:45,638 --> 00:16:47,474
To the front.

304
00:16:48,408 --> 00:16:50,377
Front again.

305
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,345
To the side.

306
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,283
To the front.

307
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:00,553
To the side.

308
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,356
Last time.

309
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,067
( doorbell chimes )

310
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,571
Furnace?

311
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,207
Do I have one?
Yes.

312
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,408
I'm here to fix it.

313
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:23,776
I didn't know
it was broken.

314
00:17:23,776 --> 00:17:25,078
Did Albert call you?

315
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:26,279
Uh...

316
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,480
My ex-husband?

317
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,718
No, yes. He--
He called yesterday.

318
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:34,087
Can I come in?

319
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:45,532
Basement's that way.

320
00:17:51,171 --> 00:17:53,440
Heel out.

321
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,375
Heel out, 
 break five...

322
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,444
arms down. 
 Heel out.

323
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:25,805
H-hello, Frannie.

324
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,707
Yes. I have a touch
of the flu.

325
00:18:27,707 --> 00:18:29,642
Could you fax me over

326
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:31,511
anything that you feel
might be important

327
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:33,313
until I shake this thing?

328
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,815
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

329
00:18:35,815 --> 00:18:37,450
Have a nice day.

330
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,686
My father
used to say that.

331
00:18:39,686 --> 00:18:41,721
Oh, really?
I hate that.

332
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,756
I'll keep that in mind.

333
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:46,193
Got to take a pill.

334
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,195
Get me a glass
of water.

335
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,696
( crunch )

336
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,632
Oh.

337
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,335
That was
my last one.

338
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:56,703
Doesn't matter.

339
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,475
You got to learn
to just say no.

340
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,245
Ha ha ha!

341
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,647
Excuse me.

342
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:11,284
Could I go
to the bathroom?

343
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:17,657
No.

344
00:19:17,657 --> 00:19:19,592
I'm comfortable
with that.

345
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:20,927
Get out of the way.

346
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:22,495
Yes.

347
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:25,164
Let's dig,
circles or no circles.

348
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,700
( shovels clang )

349
00:19:32,472 --> 00:19:35,208
Furnace?

350
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,877
Oh, I'm just looking
for the fumes detector.

351
00:19:37,877 --> 00:19:40,780
Look what I found
in your truck.

352
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,516
Who gave you the right
to go into my truck?

353
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,385
Don't you have that
backwards?

354
00:19:45,385 --> 00:19:48,388
I knew you weren't
a repairman. Out!

355
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,689
O.K., all right,
look--

356
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,491
Hey, stay away!

357
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,226
Did Albert
send you here?

358
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,727
I don't even know Albert.

359
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:56,195
How'd you know
his name?

360
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,964
You just told me
his name.

361
00:19:57,964 --> 00:20:00,633
Look, look,
I can explain this.

362
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:03,202
You've got one minute
to leave.

363
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,804
O.K., all right, O.K.

364
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,808
I don't know
what your problem is,

365
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,777
but there are circles
somewhere in here

366
00:20:10,777 --> 00:20:12,712
worth a lot of money.

367
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:14,213
Not this way!

368
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,482
Over there.

369
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:16,849
O.K., O.K.

370
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,522
And don't come back,
or I'll call the police.

371
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:24,257
There's money
in this basement.

372
00:20:24,257 --> 00:20:25,558
You have 40 seconds left.

373
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,759
No. Millions.

374
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,695
32. What do you mean,
millions?

375
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:30,663
Aw, never mind.

376
00:20:32,332 --> 00:20:33,900
19.

377
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,469
Calling the police
will cost you money.

378
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,605
I'll think about
what you said.

379
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:41,541
I may be
the sanest person
you ever meet,

380
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:44,544
so don't treat me
like a wacko.

381
00:20:44,544 --> 00:20:47,013
You're a
pathological liar.
Get out!

382
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,648
I'm going.
I'm on my way.

383
00:20:48,648 --> 00:20:51,851
Just take
my word for it.
I'm not pathological.

384
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,288
Ugh!

385
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,889
Uh...

386
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:59,292
that was three
kyoke coffees

387
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:01,294
and--and one French roast.

388
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,795
Are you sure
it's decaf?

389
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:04,797
Otherwise,
I'll be up
all night.

390
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,266
Oh, yeah.
I'm the same way.

391
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:08,768
Norm has an espresso

392
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,870
and just drops
right off to sleep,

393
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:13,573
but if I have
one sip of coffee,

394
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,508
it costs me
half the night.

395
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:19,379
I'm never effective
after a bad night's
sleep.

396
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,682
Uh...huh. Ha ha!

397
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,417
Hey, honey.

398
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:29,589
You know,
you have your safety on.

399
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:35,528
Here.

400
00:21:35,528 --> 00:21:37,430
Good.

401
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,499
Not allowed
to have caffeine.

402
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:41,067
Oh.

403
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,305
Hold it! Stop!

404
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,574
Whoa!

405
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:50,977
Stop! Stop!

406
00:21:50,977 --> 00:21:52,845
May I...

407
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,381
No, no, no, no!

408
00:21:54,381 --> 00:21:55,948
May I make
a suggestion?

409
00:21:55,948 --> 00:21:57,950
What are you yelling for?

410
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,652
That makes
a terrible racket.

411
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,021
We have the nosiest
neighbors in the state.

412
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,624
He's right.
Lydia will die.

413
00:22:04,624 --> 00:22:06,693
She'll think we're
putting in a sauna,

414
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,595
which means
they'll have
to build a sauna.

415
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:12,665
My idea is that
I use your lawn mower.

416
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,867
That will help
mask the noise.

417
00:22:14,867 --> 00:22:18,605
So I let you
out of the house?

418
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:22,108
Do I look stupid?

419
00:22:22,108 --> 00:22:24,944
Well,
then Harry can mow.

420
00:22:24,944 --> 00:22:28,014
Look...

421
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:30,717
you-- You shut up.

422
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:33,486
I'm running this,
not you.

423
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,754
Ha ha ha!

424
00:22:34,754 --> 00:22:36,856
Lyle, you mow.

425
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:39,959
Harry, keep an eye
on these two.

426
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:47,434
And don't
scare the neighbors.

427
00:22:52,104 --> 00:22:54,441
( Marvin humming )

428
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:03,550
I would just like to say
you have a lovely home.

429
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,719
A sauna would be
very nice.

430
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:09,021
( jackhammer drills )

431
00:23:09,021 --> 00:23:11,458
I need lunch money.

432
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,494
Jeffrey gave you $3.25
last night, dear.

433
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,863
Oh, yeah.

434
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:18,998
Goodbye.
Bye.

435
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,667
Give Jeffrey
a kiss goodbye.

436
00:23:20,667 --> 00:23:22,068
She doesn't have
to do that.

437
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,470
He said
I don't have to.

438
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,937
You do,

439
00:23:24,937 --> 00:23:26,539
and take off
the hat.

440
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:29,008
I like my hat.
It's awful.

441
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:30,510
It doesn't do
anything for you.

442
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,711
I'm not taking it off.

443
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,946
Jeffrey.

444
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,948
Yeah.

445
00:23:35,948 --> 00:23:37,550
You are a sweet one.

446
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,751
Swan,

447
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,052
excel.

448
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:41,754
O.K.

449
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:44,491
( Jeffrey )
Jessie Lodge
has company.

450
00:23:44,491 --> 00:23:46,158
Why don't you
like Swan?

451
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,927
She thinks
stepfathers are wicked.

452
00:23:47,927 --> 00:23:49,128
I'm obliging her.

453
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,598
She's just too smart
for you.

454
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:53,165
The Rutledges' shutters
are closed.

455
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,867
Maybe they're
making no-no.

456
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:56,068
( Jeffrey )
Are you kidding?

457
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,804
They've been married
10 years.

458
00:23:57,804 --> 00:24:00,907
I can't believe
 they hired
a gardener.

459
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,643
How did you know, uh,
Marty Rollins' phone number

460
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,012
without looking it up?
I looked it up.

461
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:08,881
Not the other day,
you didn't.

462
00:24:14,821 --> 00:24:17,590
That was
delicious coffee.

463
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,892
Well, it's all
in having fresh beans.

464
00:24:19,892 --> 00:24:23,095
I could never get
the milk to fluff up
like that.

465
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:25,865
Well, you have to have
the right espresso machine.

466
00:24:25,865 --> 00:24:29,802
I've got a friend
who used to fence
hot espresso machines.

467
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,938
That must be
exciting work.

468
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,507
Beats 9:00 to 5:00,
I guess.

469
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:37,710
I should know.
I used to work
in an office.

470
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,911
Really?

471
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:40,613
An insurance company.

472
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,549
I figured they'd never
miss a few thousand.

473
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:43,983
They deal with millions,
you know.

474
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:47,153
I can believe that,
health insurance,
especially.

475
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:50,823
It really has gotten out
of control, hasn't it?

476
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,830
I majored in sociology
at Bryn Mawr.

477
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,601
I have a million questions
I'd like to ask you.

478
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:08,708
Be careful!

479
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:23,255
( barking )

480
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:24,791
( whistles )

481
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:33,032
May I ask what it is
that we're looking for?

482
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:34,533
Dig.

483
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,603
You know...

484
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:39,772
you should consider
how odd it'll look
to our neighbors

485
00:25:39,772 --> 00:25:43,309
to see a service vehicle
parked overnight
in our driveway.

486
00:25:46,846 --> 00:25:50,016
See, I normally
go off to work

487
00:25:50,016 --> 00:25:51,217
about 7:30
in the morning

488
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,219
and return
by 7:00 at night.

489
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,922
Those are
very long hours.

490
00:25:55,922 --> 00:25:57,323
Yes. A long commute.

491
00:25:57,323 --> 00:25:59,826
We like the location.
The benefits are decent.

492
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,227
Make your point.

493
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:02,762
My point is this--

494
00:26:02,762 --> 00:26:05,765
Anything screws up,
we're dead meat, right?

495
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:08,701
So when I see
you gentlemen
being careless,

496
00:26:08,701 --> 00:26:10,102
I sort of take it
personally.

497
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,804
Spit it out!

498
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:15,141
Our nosy neighbors
are already wondering
about the van,

499
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:16,976
not to mention
the kitchen shutters,

500
00:26:16,976 --> 00:26:20,346
so if you want the cops
off our backs,

501
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,914
things have
to look normal.

502
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,050
I have to be seen
going to work.

503
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,719
That's impossible.
Not quite.

504
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:29,622
You take the van
like you finished work

505
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,023
and park
in the commuter lot.

506
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:33,159
Tomorrow I drive off,
as if to work,

507
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:36,729
one of you on the floor
with a gun.

508
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:39,098
We switch vehicles,
drive back in the van,

509
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,700
sneak me
into the garage.

510
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,901
Then you have
the appearance

511
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:43,135
of business as usual.

512
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:44,804
May I suggest one thing?

513
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:48,074
Since Lyle
has already been seen
mowing the lawn,

514
00:26:48,074 --> 00:26:49,608
he should continue
a program

515
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,611
of hedging, trimming,
and pruning.

516
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,246
I can make up a list.

517
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:58,651
That's a good plan,
but I don't like it.

518
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,320
W-well, I'm comfortable
with that.

519
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,955
This guy's nuts.

520
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,257
Probably doesn't want to do
the yard work himself.

521
00:27:05,257 --> 00:27:07,059
Take it easy!

522
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:08,961
You dig.

523
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,063
I don't want
to mow the lawn.

524
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,865
Just pretend.

525
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:14,767
Norm!

526
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:15,968
Oh, s--

527
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:18,805
Why are you even
talking to them?

528
00:27:23,943 --> 00:27:25,211
Many of us want things.

529
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:27,246
We say, "I want 
 a relationship."

530
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:31,918
( telephone rings )

531
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,219
Hello.

532
00:27:33,219 --> 00:27:34,921
Don't hang up!
Who is this?

533
00:27:34,921 --> 00:27:37,790
The guy from
your basement.

534
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,692
I feel terrible
about what happened.

535
00:27:39,692 --> 00:27:40,893
Ha ha.

536
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:42,995
You knew it was
my machine.

537
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:46,065
I'll get back to you
if you leave a message.

538
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,299
Beep!

539
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,401
I just want
to say I feel badly

540
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:50,937
about what happened.

541
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:52,939
I'm the guy
from your basement.

542
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:54,240
I apologize, and it--

543
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,441
( click )

544
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:56,909
( dial tone )

545
00:28:40,186 --> 00:28:41,854
Don't get hysterical.

546
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,924
Uh!

547
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:47,193
Let me go!
Let me go!

548
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:50,129
Aah!

549
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:51,430
Oh!

550
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,865
Uh!

551
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,467
Aah!

552
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,738
You are a maniac!

553
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,775
Aah!

554
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:04,110
I am not a maniac.

555
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,845
I'm a psychologist.

556
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:07,046
Aah!

557
00:29:07,046 --> 00:29:08,547
Shh! Shh!

558
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:10,983
Don't scream.
Don't scream.
Don't scream.

559
00:29:16,288 --> 00:29:17,489
Don't scream.

560
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,491
Mm-mmm.
Don't scream.

561
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,993
Mm-mmm.
O.K.?

562
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:22,995
Mm-hmm.

563
00:29:22,995 --> 00:29:24,296
God!

564
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:26,132
Did you hear that?

565
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:28,100
I need ice.
I need ice.

566
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,936
Do you
have some ice?

567
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:41,914
Aah!

568
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,449
Ooh!

569
00:29:48,054 --> 00:29:50,056
( woman's voice )
 Cherry Hill 
 help line.

570
00:29:50,056 --> 00:29:52,158
If you're 
 calling from 
 a touch-tone phone,

571
00:29:52,158 --> 00:29:54,526
press 1 now.

572
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,563
If this 
 is an emergency,

573
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:00,066
press 2 now.

574
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,934
If you need 
 the fire department,

575
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,836
press 6 now.

576
00:30:03,836 --> 00:30:05,872
If you need 
 the police 
 department,

577
00:30:05,872 --> 00:30:08,207
press 7 now.

578
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:11,878
If you call the police,
nobody will get the money.

579
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:15,147
They stole it
from a mafia skim bank!

580
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,817
Look! Right here!

581
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,152
Right here. Look.

582
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:22,521
See? Look. That's me. That's me.

583
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,156
( man )
Cherry Hill police.

584
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,992
Uh, sorry.
Wrong number.

585
00:30:25,992 --> 00:30:27,493
Sorry.

586
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,965
Must be
an old picture.

587
00:30:36,202 --> 00:30:39,371
It's nice to sleep
in the same bed again.

588
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:41,908
Reminds me of before
we were married.

589
00:30:41,908 --> 00:30:44,911
Nobody has to know
about our sleeping
arrangements.

590
00:30:44,911 --> 00:30:47,513
Oh, they're all asleep.

591
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:50,950
If I could get loose,
we could run for it.

592
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,085
This is a window
of opportunity.

593
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:55,254
They'd cut you down.

594
00:30:55,254 --> 00:30:57,256
They wouldn't
risk the gunfire.

595
00:30:57,256 --> 00:30:58,958
Those guns have silencers.

596
00:30:58,958 --> 00:31:01,260
Yeah, well--
How do you know?

597
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,528
Harry told me.

598
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,130
"Harry told me."

599
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:05,932
I'm your husband,
not Harry.

600
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,133
So?

601
00:31:07,133 --> 00:31:10,102
So you listen to me,
not Harry.

602
00:31:10,102 --> 00:31:12,404
( groaning )

603
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:26,285
I was just wondering

604
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,220
if you use
hollow-tip bullets.

605
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,222
Sure.

606
00:31:39,365 --> 00:31:41,067
( ring )

607
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:45,104
( ring )

608
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,506
Hello.

609
00:31:47,506 --> 00:31:50,309
Don't think I don't know
what you're up to.

610
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:53,412
If you touch my wife again,
I'll kill you.

611
00:31:53,412 --> 00:31:55,081
( dial tone )

612
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:01,153
I think your husband
just called.

613
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,122
Oh, no!

614
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:05,491
Oh, no, I shouldn't...

615
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:08,027
It's O.K., Jillian.

616
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,429
I shouldn't
have done this!

617
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:11,930
You did
the right thing.

618
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,132
No, I didn't!

619
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,470
Lyle and Harry
had something to do
with your bombing?

620
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:20,439
If they did,
I'm disappointed.

621
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,308
I thought we were
getting somewhere.

622
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:24,010
Maybe it's an ex-convict

623
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,112
with some unresolved
feelings about you.

624
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:28,047
Sounds like you've
had some therapy.

625
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,249
Albert and I
saw a psychiatrist.

626
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,450
Then he ran off
with her.

627
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,553
Sorry. That's bad
for the profession.

628
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:37,489
You're good for it,
breaking in
with a pickax?

629
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,425
You're very angry,
aren't you?

630
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:41,427
Sometimes if you talk
through it,

631
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,429
you can feel better.

632
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:46,132
Look, doctor--
If you are a doctor--

633
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:49,735
I don't discuss
my shitty marriage
with just anybody.

634
00:32:49,735 --> 00:32:52,504
If you want to repress it,
go ahead.

635
00:32:52,504 --> 00:32:55,407
I'm not. I'm furious,
and I'm expressing it.

636
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,244
Can I get
some more ice for the...

637
00:32:58,244 --> 00:33:00,646
Thanks.

638
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,315
So you want me
to take my house
off the market

639
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:06,152
because
there's $8 million
in my foundation?

640
00:33:06,152 --> 00:33:07,653
8 1/2.

641
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,156
Well, excuse me
for not trusting
psychiatrists anymore.

642
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,624
I'm a psychologist.
There's a difference.

643
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:15,427
I know. You're not
as well-trained.

644
00:33:15,427 --> 00:33:18,764
Somebody tries to kill
you, and you say
you're disappointed?

645
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:20,999
Talk about
not expressing yourself.

646
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:24,070
Look, I'll give you 10 percent
of the 8 1/2 million.

647
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:26,105
Ha! 10?
This is my house.

648
00:33:26,105 --> 00:33:28,707
50 of that goes
to that lady in St. Louis.

649
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:32,244
I could kick you out
and keep it.

650
00:33:32,244 --> 00:33:33,579
I'd tell the police.

651
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,547
Look, look, look.

652
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:36,748
20 percent.

653
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:39,017
I'll do all the work.

654
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:43,655
I want half
of whatever you get.

655
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,657
Half. Yes or no?

656
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:49,195
Deal, but you do
half the work.

657
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,365
Oh, God! Oh!

658
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:56,068
I know it's not easy
for you right now,

659
00:33:56,068 --> 00:34:00,038
but, uh,
things will work out.

660
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,540
Whenever Albert
used those words,

661
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,808
I knew he was lying.

662
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,510
Anything else?
No.

663
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,388
Do you want to, uh,

664
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,257
you want
to give her a try?

665
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,292
O.K.

666
00:34:20,292 --> 00:34:21,627
So we're going
on the word

667
00:34:21,627 --> 00:34:23,462
of a convicted felon
called Tricks?

668
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25,197
It was his last request.

669
00:34:25,197 --> 00:34:27,266
Oh, well, then...

670
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,435
Just aim for the circle.

671
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,176
Nice swing.

672
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:44,650
( Jeffrey )
Norm just left
for work.

673
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,452
What was that noise
last night?

674
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:47,819
I slept through it.

675
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:49,355
Digging.
What?

676
00:34:49,355 --> 00:34:50,522
Somebody's digging.

677
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:51,857
Maybe somebody's
burying a body.

678
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:55,294
Don't be juvenile.
I am a juvenile.

679
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:56,595
Do you have
your lunch money?

680
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,096
Jeffrey, give her
lunch money.

681
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:01,099
Swan, give Jeffrey
a kiss goodbye.

682
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,435
The money's
on the dresser.

683
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,106
Actually, the little...

684
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,409
She may be right
about the body.

685
00:35:10,409 --> 00:35:12,778
I heard some screaming
in the night.

686
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:15,681
Maybe Albert slipped
over there and murdered her

687
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:17,716
and buried her
in the garden.

688
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:26,758
Or maybe it was
your friend Marty.

689
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:29,661
Your corpse looks
pretty healthy to me.

690
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,466
How did you sleep?

691
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,767
Oh, not bad.

692
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:39,805
I've never slept
tied up before.

693
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,340
No?

694
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,699
Come on.
Pretty good plan, huh?

695
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,900
Move.

696
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,837
* You have a way *

697
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:14,706
* With your way *

698
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:16,942
* And I'm waiting *

699
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:20,312
* For every way **

700
00:36:20,312 --> 00:36:22,581
Do you have to sing?

701
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:24,383
It makes the work
go faster.

702
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:25,917
Not for me.

703
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,420
What are you,
a music critic?

704
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,259
You the one who picked out
that astroturf?

705
00:36:33,259 --> 00:36:35,227
Albert did.

706
00:36:35,227 --> 00:36:37,663
Took absolutely no
interest in this house

707
00:36:37,663 --> 00:36:39,231
or anyone in it.

708
00:36:39,231 --> 00:36:40,832
He was the most selfish,
conceited,

709
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:43,335
and ultimately
dishonest person
I've ever known.

710
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:44,703
He never even voted.

711
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:45,904
Huh.

712
00:36:45,904 --> 00:36:47,706
He screwed me.

713
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,808
That's what people
do to each other.

714
00:36:49,808 --> 00:36:51,343
It's an old story.

715
00:36:51,343 --> 00:36:52,611
And I let him.

716
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:55,514
I put him through
business school.

717
00:36:55,514 --> 00:36:57,883
We were going
to have nine kids,

718
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,951
only he changed
his mind.

719
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:01,520
He didn't want
any kids.

720
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,322
He didn't even
want a wife.

721
00:37:03,322 --> 00:37:04,656
I see.

722
00:37:04,656 --> 00:37:06,858
So we started going
to see a shrink,

723
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:08,694
then he
ran off with her.

724
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,296
Yeah. You told me.

725
00:37:10,296 --> 00:37:12,898
This is what believing
in marriage gets you.

726
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:18,737
You can get shafted
just as easily
when you're single.

727
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:21,006
A wedding ring
is a "kick me" sign.

728
00:37:21,006 --> 00:37:24,276
You can get kicked
with or without the sign.

729
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:26,478
Maybe I don't want
an answer.

730
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:29,481
Maybe I just want
to feel bad, O.K.?

731
00:37:29,481 --> 00:37:31,317
O.K.

732
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,725
It's just hard.

733
00:37:39,725 --> 00:37:41,993
( sobbing )

734
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:49,935
Oh, don't touch me.

735
00:37:53,572 --> 00:37:56,508
Oh, don't even
think about it!

736
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:59,311
What? What?

737
00:37:59,311 --> 00:38:00,512
What?

738
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,880
What, are you kidding me?

739
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:04,416
That was the last thing
on my mind.

740
00:38:04,416 --> 00:38:06,051
A woman gets divorced,

741
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:09,321
suddenly
it's everybody's job
to make her feel better.

742
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:14,059
Look, look,
if you don't want to talk,

743
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,461
you just say so.

744
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,529
I don't want to talk.

745
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:19,398
Fine.

746
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:20,632
Paper boy!

747
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,033
Hey, get out of there.

748
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,935
I'm collecting.
How much?

749
00:38:23,935 --> 00:38:25,804
7.50.

750
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,575
They're busy. Here.

751
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:30,776
Thanks.

752
00:38:30,776 --> 00:38:32,978
Whoa! I thought
you said 7.50.

753
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:34,680
Well,
they usually tip me,

754
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,483
and I don't have
any change.

755
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,551
You
the new gardener?

756
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,819
What if I am?

757
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,554
My parents need one.

758
00:38:42,554 --> 00:38:44,623
I'm booked.
They're competitive.

759
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:46,492
They'll pay more
than you're getting.

760
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,926
I can't be bought.

761
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,461
They'd never
understand that.

762
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:51,430
Tell them
to go fuck themselves.

763
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,999
They'll understand that.

764
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:58,804
Do you think you could
fix this chain?

765
00:38:58,804 --> 00:39:00,038
Sure...

766
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:02,040
for 10 bucks.

767
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,486
Paper boy!

768
00:39:14,486 --> 00:39:16,021
( doorbell chimes )

769
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:51,122
Oh...

770
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:52,891
( horn honks )

771
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,127
Oh!

772
00:39:58,096 --> 00:40:00,131
Come on!

773
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,473
( knock on door )

774
00:40:09,641 --> 00:40:12,110
Mrs. Lodge?

775
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,851
Must be out back.

776
00:40:23,054 --> 00:40:26,458
( Marty )
I think you're going
to love this neighborhood.

777
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:27,959
It's tres recherche.

778
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,700
( knock on door )

779
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,502
Mrs. Lodge, it's Marty!

780
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:38,904
I have the Kims here!

781
00:40:38,904 --> 00:40:41,940
( doorbell chimes )

782
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,141
You know what?

783
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,443
We'll come back.

784
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:05,497
What the hell
is going on
over here?

785
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:06,732
Settle down.

786
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:08,199
Ha ha ha!

787
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,902
Lyle's talking
to some kids out there.

788
00:41:10,902 --> 00:41:13,505
He shouldn't be
talking to anybody.

789
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:15,774
Hey, who asked you?

790
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:20,478
Yeah, he shouldn't be
talking to anybody
out there.

791
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,047
Harry, go get him.

792
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,616
He started it.
He squealed on me.

793
00:41:24,616 --> 00:41:26,652
He told the teacher
on us.

794
00:41:26,652 --> 00:41:28,820
Break his glasses.
What?

795
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,690
You want to
teach him a lesson?
Break his glasses.

796
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,860
Cut it out!

797
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,762
There are rules to life.

798
00:41:36,762 --> 00:41:38,864
One of the most important
you'll find is--

799
00:41:38,864 --> 00:41:42,801
Nobody likes a squealer.

800
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,536
Now tell him.

801
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,838
He does it again,

802
00:41:46,838 --> 00:41:49,240
you'll hurt him.

803
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,809
Come on!

804
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,043
There's
a philosophical point

805
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:53,979
I'm trying to make here!

806
00:41:53,979 --> 00:41:57,683
The world is divided into
the doers and the doees.

807
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,117
The doees pay taxes

808
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:02,187
and generally
get shitted upon.

809
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:06,057
People look up
to the doers.

810
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:08,293
I'm a doer!

811
00:42:08,293 --> 00:42:10,896
Lyle,
may I speak with you?

812
00:42:10,896 --> 00:42:12,631
Sure.

813
00:42:12,631 --> 00:42:14,800
There's something
seriously wrong
with you.

814
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,803
Maybe yes...

815
00:42:17,803 --> 00:42:20,238
maybe no.

816
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:25,644
Jessie, it's me.

817
00:42:28,714 --> 00:42:30,716
What the--

818
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:40,191
It's Albert.
I don't want him
to see me like this.

819
00:42:40,191 --> 00:42:42,861
O.K.
I'll take care of it.

820
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,011
You might
want to go out

821
00:43:00,011 --> 00:43:02,681
the same way
you came in, pal--

822
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:04,015
Empty-handed.

823
00:43:04,015 --> 00:43:06,151
This is my house, pal.

824
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:07,585
These are my clothes.

825
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:08,920
I wouldn't brag.

826
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,188
Your name Albert?

827
00:43:10,188 --> 00:43:11,990
Yeah. Who are you?

828
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:13,925
Jessie says you got
your share already.

829
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:16,127
The rest is hers.
You know that.

830
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:19,798
Are you the plumber
or just plumbing Jessie?

831
00:43:19,798 --> 00:43:22,000
Hyaaah!

832
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,803
Don't make a move.
I know karate.

833
00:43:28,173 --> 00:43:31,109
That was an antique.
Give me the watch.

834
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:32,744
It's my goddamn watch!

835
00:43:32,744 --> 00:43:35,080
It was her stereo!
Oh, yeah?

836
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,015
Not here, baby.
Why don't we try the--

837
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:40,886
Albert, I didn't know
you were here.

838
00:43:40,886 --> 00:43:42,721
Yes.

839
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,255
He was
just leaving.

840
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,691
Damn.

841
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:47,726
You know what, kids?

842
00:43:47,726 --> 00:43:49,761
You're going to hear
from my lawyer.

843
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:52,263
Does he know
karate, too?

844
00:43:52,263 --> 00:43:54,933
You certainly
don't waste any time.

845
00:44:17,288 --> 00:44:19,958
Oh, Albert.

846
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:25,096
Hey, come on.
We'll talk.

847
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,966
Why can't you mind
your own business?

848
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,315
( bell rings )

849
00:44:44,315 --> 00:44:46,051
Quiche is ready.

850
00:44:46,051 --> 00:44:47,418
I'll help you with that.

851
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:49,254
You dig.

852
00:44:49,254 --> 00:44:52,190
You help her.

853
00:44:57,328 --> 00:44:59,030
Smells good.

854
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,698
It is good.

855
00:45:02,968 --> 00:45:04,702
I mean you.

856
00:45:06,337 --> 00:45:09,440
You must've studied
sociology.

857
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:13,011
Criminals
have very poor
impulse control.

858
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:17,348
I'll bet
you're the type
that fantasizes

859
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:18,884
gangsters
breaking in here

860
00:45:18,884 --> 00:45:21,719
and having their way
with you.

861
00:45:29,795 --> 00:45:31,029
Ohh...

862
00:45:32,363 --> 00:45:34,465
y-y-you're sick.

863
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,768
It's a sick society.

864
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:39,737
Oh, no.
I don't buy that excuse.

865
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,908
You've got to learn to be
responsible for yourself.

866
00:45:42,908 --> 00:45:44,142
You sound like
my shrink.

867
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,077
Now, come on.

868
00:45:46,077 --> 00:45:48,379
You've got
a lot going for you.

869
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,081
You're good-looking,

870
00:45:50,081 --> 00:45:52,383
you've got
a great body,

871
00:45:52,383 --> 00:45:54,252
an inquisitive mi--

872
00:45:54,252 --> 00:45:56,454
You appreciate
fine food and--

873
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:59,090
Did you say-- You say--

874
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:03,061
A good body
or a great body?

875
00:46:05,964 --> 00:46:08,066
Let's serve the quiche.

876
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,980
( classical music plays )

877
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,382
Nice music.

878
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:27,118
I plopped these tapes on
'cause I hid them

879
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,887
when Albert was
stealing the stereo.

880
00:46:28,887 --> 00:46:32,991
That doesn't mean
that I'd be hiding
things from you.

881
00:46:32,991 --> 00:46:34,192
We're partners.

882
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:35,393
Did I say anything?

883
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:37,062
You looked it.

884
00:46:37,062 --> 00:46:38,429
( knock on door )

885
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,404
I didn't know
you had company.

886
00:46:46,404 --> 00:46:47,973
Marty,
this is Will...

887
00:46:47,973 --> 00:46:49,507
Goldberg.
Willie Goldberg.

888
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,476
He's a...
he's an old, uh...

889
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,878
cousin.

890
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:54,179
He's an old
cousin of mine.

891
00:46:54,179 --> 00:46:56,547
Cousin?

892
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,818
Hello.

893
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:04,422
I just dropped by to see
if you needed anything.

894
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:07,458
Got some serious buyers
coming in next week.

895
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,027
( turns TV off )

896
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:11,129
Come on.
Why did you--

897
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:13,965
I'm hearing noises.

898
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:16,001
You're just
imagining it, Marvin.

899
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:18,870
Go check it out.

900
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:22,073
It's just the neighbor
trying to diddle
the divorcee.

901
00:47:22,073 --> 00:47:23,274
He won't be long.

902
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:25,243
Since when
do you use
the word diddle?

903
00:47:29,114 --> 00:47:30,315
Damn.

904
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:32,183
Jeffrey...

905
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:36,054
that man drove away
in his van an hour ago.

906
00:47:36,054 --> 00:47:38,856
Aah! Aah!

907
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,432
Marvin!

908
00:47:47,432 --> 00:47:50,501
Aah!

909
00:47:50,501 --> 00:47:53,871
I told you
they had silencers!

910
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:56,074
My Neiman! My investment!

911
00:47:56,074 --> 00:47:57,408
Your invest--

912
00:47:57,408 --> 00:48:00,211
I never did like
that painting
anyway.

913
00:48:00,211 --> 00:48:03,014
May I speak without
getting shot at?

914
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:06,384
Marvin, we've got to get you
more medication.

915
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:09,487
Willis Embry's
right next door.

916
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:11,056
What do you mean?

917
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,991
You can't see him
from there.

918
00:48:12,991 --> 00:48:14,559
But the papers say--

919
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,462
You can't believe
what you read
in the papers.

920
00:48:17,462 --> 00:48:20,531
You know,
I've had it with you.

921
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,200
You talk and talk--

922
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:23,468
Ow!

923
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:28,239
You stay away from me,
Marvin.

924
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:31,476
I'm not following any man
who can't keep his cool.

925
00:48:31,476 --> 00:48:35,680
Aah!

926
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,582
( glass breaks )

927
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,250
You shouldn't
have done that.

928
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,918
I'm splitting.

929
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:43,054
You want to walk away
from $8 million?

930
00:48:43,054 --> 00:48:45,390
My ass is more valuable.

931
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:48,359
If he knew we were here,
he would've busted us.

932
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:53,098
Not if he knows that
we're sitting on the money.

933
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:57,468
We don't want your money.
Just don't hurt us anymore.

934
00:48:57,468 --> 00:49:00,571
I'd like to speak
to you outside.

935
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:03,574
You got anything to say,
say it right here.

936
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:05,410
I'm getting
very perturbed.

937
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,146
I want to have
a discussion
in confidence.

938
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:09,714
Is it about me?

939
00:49:09,714 --> 00:49:11,116
It ain't.

940
00:49:11,116 --> 00:49:13,084
How do I know that?

941
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:19,557
If you're
worried about us
running away, don't.

942
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:21,026
Cuffs!

943
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:23,494
Cuffs, cuffs.
You heard him. Quick!

944
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,997
Cuffs. Cuffs.

945
00:49:25,997 --> 00:49:27,298
Is that all right
with you?

946
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,635
Just don't
bash the lady, Marvin.

947
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,204
Just don't hurt me.

948
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:44,415
Maybe it's just some guy
who looks like Embry.

949
00:49:44,415 --> 00:49:46,984
You want
fingerprints?
I saw him.

950
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,186
Uh-huh.

951
00:49:49,687 --> 00:49:51,089
( door closes )

952
00:49:51,089 --> 00:49:53,124
We're going to
get that money.

953
00:49:53,124 --> 00:49:55,026
I don't want the money.

954
00:49:55,026 --> 00:49:57,262
I just want
to survive this.

955
00:49:57,262 --> 00:50:00,298
You hit me
when my back was turned.

956
00:50:00,298 --> 00:50:02,700
I don't want
to talk about it.

957
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:05,370
I'm very upset.
I need to express it.

958
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:07,172
Tough shit.

959
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:10,241
You're creating
a leadership crisis here.

960
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,743
These people
need to understand
I'm in charge.

961
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,313
Don't be that way.
Three is a hard number.

962
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:17,148
It changes the dynamic.

963
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:18,783
May I interrupt
this discussion

964
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:21,552
to point out
Willis Embry's ass?

965
00:50:23,421 --> 00:50:25,190
It's Embry.

966
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:29,160
Get out of the way.

967
00:50:33,131 --> 00:50:35,032
So, Marvin...

968
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,469
you're going to blow away
Embry, the realtor,
the woman,

969
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,738
two different rooms
with one burst?

970
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:44,409
Jessie, I want to thank you
for this opportunity.

971
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:47,078
To do what?
To sell the house.

972
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:48,413
You're doing
a good job.

973
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,315
Means a lot to me.

974
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:52,583
Can I, uh,
have a hug?

975
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,619
What for?

976
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,087
I need one.

977
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,089
O.K. Sure.

978
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,593
Hey, Marty...

979
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:05,230
Don't do that!
Don't, Marty!

980
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,332
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.

981
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:08,699
What are you
thinking?

982
00:51:08,699 --> 00:51:10,101
Oh.

983
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:13,204
Suburbia, man.
Yeah.

984
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:19,677
You're not going to your
sexaholics anonymous
meetings, are you?

985
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,078
I've been busy.

986
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:22,780
I'm taking a chance
on you.

987
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:25,750
Behave yourself
and keep your hands
off the buyers.

988
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,252
I'm sorry.

989
00:51:27,252 --> 00:51:28,719
Sorry isn't good enough.

990
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,422
You'll see.
I will be better.

991
00:51:31,422 --> 00:51:32,723
I promise.

992
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,527
I will.

993
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:40,498
What do you
think of that?

994
00:51:40,498 --> 00:51:43,734
You used to kiss me
like that.

995
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,618
So you'll really look
up this Louise person?

996
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,720
I promised Tricks.

997
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:05,556
Honor among thieves?

998
00:52:05,556 --> 00:52:07,558
It's mafia money anyway.

999
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,394
That makes
what you're doing right?

1000
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:10,695
What we're doing right.

1001
00:52:10,695 --> 00:52:12,430
( knock on door )

1002
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,632
Paper boy.

1003
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:15,833
Hi.

1004
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17,067
Collecting.

1005
00:52:17,067 --> 00:52:18,436
How much is it again?

1006
00:52:18,436 --> 00:52:21,406
7.50 plus tip
brings it to 10.

1007
00:52:21,406 --> 00:52:23,341
I'm getting
my bike fixed.

1008
00:52:23,341 --> 00:52:25,810
You want
to contribute
to a new bike?

1009
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,512
Maybe tomorrow.

1010
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:28,813
What are you digging?

1011
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:31,782
Jacuzzi.
Drainage.

1012
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:33,318
Here's 10 more.

1013
00:52:33,318 --> 00:52:36,787
Tell your parents
you met my cousin
Willie Goldberg.

1014
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,823
From Texas.
You lost your accent.

1015
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,258
Did I?

1016
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:47,398
It's none
of their business,
in my opinion.

1017
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,634
( door opens )

1018
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,337
What a nympho.

1019
00:52:52,337 --> 00:52:53,938
For someone who's
turned off to men,

1020
00:52:53,938 --> 00:52:57,242
you sure let
Marty think he was
getting somewhere.

1021
00:52:57,242 --> 00:52:59,444
What are you
talking about?

1022
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:00,911
I saw you kiss him.

1023
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,449
It's a good idea
to avoid outside
entanglements

1024
00:53:04,449 --> 00:53:06,617
until we find
the money, O.K.?

1025
00:53:06,617 --> 00:53:08,253
You want
to get the light?

1026
00:53:08,253 --> 00:53:11,756
Look, not that this is
any of your business,

1027
00:53:11,756 --> 00:53:14,259
but Marty and I
are just friends.

1028
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:17,562
Yeah, fine.

1029
00:53:17,562 --> 00:53:19,230
You'd never find a man

1030
00:53:19,230 --> 00:53:22,600
playing with emotions
like that.

1031
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:24,669
Oh, I never found a man
who had any.

1032
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:27,872
Women are no better.

1033
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:30,441
My girl
told me every day
she loved me,

1034
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:33,444
even the day
she left me.

1035
00:53:35,746 --> 00:53:39,417
Maybe she left you
because you called her
"my girl."

1036
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:52,697
( cracking )

1037
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:53,964
Uhh.

1038
00:54:14,685 --> 00:54:16,854
I could get you
a good return
on your money.

1039
00:54:16,854 --> 00:54:18,756
Shh.

1040
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,224
I hear digging.

1041
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,027
( thump )

1042
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:28,165
Lyle, are you sure you
got the right address?

1043
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,638
I got us close.

1044
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,743
All right,
so cheer up.

1045
00:54:38,743 --> 00:54:42,447
At least
you've got a good start
on a decent tunnel.

1046
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:46,451
There are no problems
with nosy neighbors.

1047
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:48,519
Ha ha.

1048
00:55:17,682 --> 00:55:19,116
( clang )

1049
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:26,557
What are you doing?

1050
00:55:28,893 --> 00:55:30,027
What are you doing?

1051
00:55:30,027 --> 00:55:32,597
What were you doing?
You were digging.

1052
00:55:32,597 --> 00:55:33,798
I couldn't sleep.

1053
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:36,501
So you thought
you'd dig quietly,

1054
00:55:36,501 --> 00:55:38,903
find the money,
wake me up,
give me my share?

1055
00:55:38,903 --> 00:55:40,170
Yeah, right.

1056
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,573
Let me do that.

1057
00:55:47,412 --> 00:55:48,913
You know,

1058
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:50,415
maybe
it would help you

1059
00:55:50,415 --> 00:55:52,016
if you learned
to trust people.

1060
00:55:52,016 --> 00:55:54,519
You don't trust me
like I don't trust you.

1061
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:56,353
I didn't say I did.

1062
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,924
I came down
because I had lots
of nervous energy.

1063
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:02,927
If you were a man,
you would understand.

1064
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:07,097
You don't think
I have nervous energy?

1065
00:56:07,097 --> 00:56:09,934
I can't believe
a psychologist
could be so unaware

1066
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:13,504
of how to talk
to a woman.

1067
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:16,040
You've worked too long
with big, hairy convicts.

1068
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,842
You can't relate
to a normal person.

1069
00:56:17,842 --> 00:56:20,044
Normal? Please.

1070
00:56:20,044 --> 00:56:22,780
It's no wonder
your girlfriend left you.

1071
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:26,951
Sometimes people leave
no matter how much
a person loves them.

1072
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:30,421
Sometimes it's them,
not you.

1073
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:47,538
Get back in the hole.

1074
00:56:47,538 --> 00:56:50,775
I said get back
in the hole now!

1075
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:54,679
All right, gentlemen,
let's cut the crap.

1076
00:56:54,679 --> 00:56:56,814
What I'm telling you is...

1077
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,015
undo me.

1078
00:56:58,015 --> 00:56:59,750
I'm going
to whack this guy.

1079
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,118
Go on, hit me!

1080
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,020
Come on!
You need me.

1081
00:57:03,020 --> 00:57:04,622
Norm, stop it.

1082
00:57:04,622 --> 00:57:05,890
He's cracking,
I'm telling you.

1083
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,493
Undo me.
It'll change your lives.

1084
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:12,497
I can turn your 8 million
into 85 million

1085
00:57:12,497 --> 00:57:13,964
in 30 days.

1086
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:16,634
Norman, what are you
talking about?

1087
00:57:16,634 --> 00:57:18,102
Not now, pumpkin!

1088
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:21,539
I've got connections
you can only dream about,

1089
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:24,942
and I can prove it.

1090
00:57:24,942 --> 00:57:26,744
If you're not convinced,
you can shoot me.

1091
00:57:26,744 --> 00:57:29,179
Shoot you anyway.

1092
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,948
Go on. Undo him.

1093
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:33,484
This better be good,
wimp.

1094
00:57:38,823 --> 00:57:43,027
You call me sir
from now on,
all right?

1095
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:47,832
What are you doing?

1096
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:49,567
I said
what are you doing?

1097
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,502
We can't let him do
what he wants.

1098
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:53,504
( Peedi )
Norm?

1099
00:57:55,573 --> 00:57:57,508
( gasp )

1100
00:58:07,852 --> 00:58:10,020
( gasp )

1101
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:13,858
From Cuba...

1102
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:15,526
with love.

1103
00:58:20,631 --> 00:58:22,366
Relax, gentlemen.

1104
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:24,034
It's contraband.

1105
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,038
Russia's finest.

1106
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,041
Na zdorov'e!

1107
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:37,247
Compliments
of resistance groups

1108
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:38,649
left and right.

1109
00:58:38,649 --> 00:58:40,551
Norm,
what is going on?

1110
00:58:40,551 --> 00:58:42,252
Where did this room
come from?

1111
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,888
The Eisenhower era,
honey.

1112
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:46,190
It's a fallout shelter,
a business write-off.

1113
00:58:46,190 --> 00:58:47,558
I can't handle
this shit.

1114
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:48,826
You're bush league.
That's why.

1115
00:58:48,826 --> 00:58:50,027
I'll kill you.

1116
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:53,263
Take it easy.
Put it down.

1117
00:58:53,263 --> 00:58:55,065
Now.

1118
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:59,103
Good boy, Marvin.
Good boy.

1119
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:01,405
Take a look.
Be my guest.

1120
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:02,539
Go on, gentlemen.

1121
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,141
Go ahead.

1122
00:59:04,141 --> 00:59:05,710
I'm offering you
connections--

1123
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:08,713
Colombia, Switzerland,
Havana, D.C., Moscow.

1124
00:59:08,713 --> 00:59:11,782
It's the new American
capitalism, gentlemen.

1125
00:59:11,782 --> 00:59:13,417
Let's make a deal.

1126
00:59:13,417 --> 00:59:16,921
First, we make
a simple assault next door,

1127
00:59:16,921 --> 00:59:18,422
we off the competition,

1128
00:59:18,422 --> 00:59:20,591
but we do it in
the American tradition--

1129
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:21,959
Discreetly--

1130
00:59:21,959 --> 00:59:24,561
Or you go back to jail
and me 9:00 to 5:00.

1131
00:59:24,561 --> 00:59:26,096
I thought it was
7:00 to 7:00.

1132
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:28,866
Eat my shorts, Harry.
I'm in charge now.

1133
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:31,636
Right, Marvin?

1134
00:59:31,636 --> 00:59:34,605
Get out of the way.
Come on.

1135
00:59:41,846 --> 00:59:43,948
You know what these are?

1136
00:59:43,948 --> 00:59:45,449
Concussion grenades.

1137
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:46,951
Repeat after me.

1138
00:59:46,951 --> 00:59:48,953
Concussion grenades.

1139
00:59:48,953 --> 00:59:52,022
We can blast the tunnel with
these babies in no time.

1140
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,991
Let's shoot him.
He's flipped.

1141
00:59:53,991 --> 00:59:56,160
You better talk nice
to Norm,

1142
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,829
or these guys
will shoot you.

1143
01:00:04,902 --> 01:00:06,971
Wait. Here.

1144
01:00:13,177 --> 01:00:14,679
Thank you...

1145
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,346
Marvy.

1146
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,371
What are you doing?

1147
01:01:14,371 --> 01:01:16,240
One working woman's
special

1148
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,242
coming right up.

1149
01:01:18,242 --> 01:01:19,744
Hope you like 'em
scrambled.

1150
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:22,012
Ah-ah-ah.

1151
01:01:22,012 --> 01:01:25,449
If you put salt on them,
they won't be as fluffy.

1152
01:01:25,449 --> 01:01:28,252
You want to cook them,
make them fluffy?

1153
01:01:28,252 --> 01:01:32,056
They're your eggs.
Have them the way
you want them.

1154
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:34,024
I could make tea.

1155
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:35,760
If you get me coffee,

1156
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,295
I'll give you
5 percent more of the money.

1157
01:01:38,295 --> 01:01:41,766
Don't let them
overcharge you
on the fine, dear.

1158
01:01:41,766 --> 01:01:43,433
Excel.

1159
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:45,803
How do you expect
someone to excel

1160
01:01:45,803 --> 01:01:48,272
when they have to ride
this piece of shit?

1161
01:01:48,272 --> 01:01:50,274
Maybe Jeffrey
can fix it.

1162
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:52,376
Jeffrey can't change
a typewriter ribbon.

1163
01:01:52,376 --> 01:01:55,445
Jeffrey's genius doesn't lie
in things mechanical, dear.

1164
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:57,147
You talk so weird.

1165
01:01:57,147 --> 01:01:59,083
That's an expensive bike.

1166
01:01:59,083 --> 01:02:00,918
It sucks.

1167
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,155
You'll have to clean up
that little girl's mouth.

1168
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:06,791
Jeffrey, get bent.

1169
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08,893
Oh. Lydia...

1170
01:02:08,893 --> 01:02:10,727
do you believe this?

1171
01:02:13,263 --> 01:02:16,901
I thought
he was booked solid.

1172
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:18,435
That's bullshit.

1173
01:02:21,872 --> 01:02:23,707
What's that noise?

1174
01:02:24,408 --> 01:02:26,010
Lyle?

1175
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:33,784
I think
they found the house.

1176
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:35,319
This neighborhood's
too damn noisy.

1177
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:37,855
We can't get
any work done.

1178
01:02:37,855 --> 01:02:39,489
Marvin.

1179
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:45,195
Excuse me.
I'd like a word
with you, please.

1180
01:02:47,331 --> 01:02:48,933
Is this concrete enough
for you?

1181
01:02:48,933 --> 01:02:50,300
Let's call the police.

1182
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:52,870
What, kiss that
8 1/2 million goodbye?

1183
01:02:52,870 --> 01:02:54,438
They're trying
to kill us!

1184
01:02:54,438 --> 01:02:56,340
We're still alive,
aren't we?

1185
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,142
They'll try again.

1186
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,513
This thing work?

1187
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,016
I thought you said
you were booked solid.

1188
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:07,217
I am.

1189
01:03:07,217 --> 01:03:08,919
Isn't our money
good enough for you?

1190
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:10,821
Look, I'm busy.

1191
01:03:10,821 --> 01:03:13,023
What is your name?

1192
01:03:13,023 --> 01:03:15,392
If they're not gone
in two minutes,
ice them.

1193
01:03:15,392 --> 01:03:16,861
Norman...

1194
01:03:16,861 --> 01:03:18,095
are you insane?

1195
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:20,865
Honey, take
the phone number
off the truck.

1196
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:22,867
I'm reporting you
to your supervisor.

1197
01:03:22,867 --> 01:03:25,369
Why don't
I take your names?

1198
01:03:25,369 --> 01:03:27,537
Then if we have
an opening next week,

1199
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:29,239
I'll do my best
to fit you in.

1200
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,541
That's the best
I can do.

1201
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:32,843
O.K.?

1202
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:35,179
Babitt.
What?

1203
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:38,348
Babitt. B-a-b-i-t-t.
Babitt.

1204
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:41,385
How can they chat
with Jeffrey
and Lydia?

1205
01:03:41,385 --> 01:03:43,453
They want the money.
That's their best hope.

1206
01:03:43,453 --> 01:03:46,891
You ever consider
nametags at all?

1207
01:03:46,891 --> 01:03:48,092
Excuse me.

1208
01:03:48,092 --> 01:03:50,895
The pen.

1209
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:52,396
You get the number,
honey?

1210
01:03:52,396 --> 01:03:54,564
Yes, I got it.

1211
01:03:57,101 --> 01:03:58,335
Come on.

1212
01:03:58,335 --> 01:04:00,570
Where are they going?

1213
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:08,412
Aah!

1214
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:10,514
Aah!

1215
01:04:10,514 --> 01:04:13,417
He used to be
a patient of mine.

1216
01:04:13,417 --> 01:04:16,086
Willis, I think
it's time we gave up.

1217
01:04:16,086 --> 01:04:17,888
No!

1218
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:20,857
Look! We got them
on the run!

1219
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:27,264
Hey.

1220
01:04:27,264 --> 01:04:30,300
I'm going to kill
that Willis.

1221
01:04:30,300 --> 01:04:32,102
Hey, Lyle...

1222
01:04:32,102 --> 01:04:34,104
you want to keep this?

1223
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,308
A little joke.

1224
01:04:38,308 --> 01:04:41,178
It hurt.

1225
01:04:41,178 --> 01:04:43,780
Norm, could--

1226
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:49,086
Could you ask them
to uncuff me?

1227
01:04:49,086 --> 01:04:51,088
I don't want you
involved.

1228
01:04:51,088 --> 01:04:54,024
I just want
to be undone.

1229
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:55,259
Pretty soon,
dumpling.

1230
01:04:55,259 --> 01:04:59,463
Marvin, we need
the demolition hammer.

1231
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:00,630
Uh...

1232
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:02,032
O.K.

1233
01:05:02,032 --> 01:05:05,235
Norman,
you could shoot them.

1234
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:06,436
Shoot them?

1235
01:05:06,436 --> 01:05:07,904
Not now, dumpling.

1236
01:05:07,904 --> 01:05:10,975
Marvin, if you
shore up that tunnel,

1237
01:05:10,975 --> 01:05:13,277
a grenade
will speed things up.

1238
01:05:13,277 --> 01:05:15,179
Where are the grenades?

1239
01:05:15,179 --> 01:05:16,513
Behind the couch.

1240
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:19,116
I just want to say

1241
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:22,386
I think you're doing
a fantastic job.

1242
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:23,587
Thank you, Marvin.

1243
01:05:23,587 --> 01:05:26,290
Coming from you,
that's a compliment.

1244
01:05:26,290 --> 01:05:28,792
I never wanted
to be in charge.

1245
01:05:28,792 --> 01:05:29,994
Oh.

1246
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:33,163
You spring guys
from the joint,

1247
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,399
and they
look up to you
for leadership.

1248
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,567
Marvin? Grenades.

1249
01:05:37,567 --> 01:05:40,137
O.K.

1250
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:45,575
Now? Will you
let me go now?

1251
01:05:45,575 --> 01:05:47,244
Not now, dumpling.

1252
01:05:47,244 --> 01:05:48,812
Uh...

1253
01:05:48,812 --> 01:05:50,147
how many?

1254
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:51,348
Two.

1255
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:53,050
Good. You did good.

1256
01:05:53,050 --> 01:05:54,584
Why build this tunnel?

1257
01:05:54,584 --> 01:05:57,821
If we want to kill them,
let's finish the job.

1258
01:05:57,821 --> 01:06:00,324
Norm wants a tunnel,
we give him a tunnel.

1259
01:06:00,324 --> 01:06:02,626
You don't like it,
you talk to Norm.

1260
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,828
I live in this neighborhood
myself.

1261
01:06:04,828 --> 01:06:06,330
Beautiful
shade trees.

1262
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:07,631
They've been here
for years.

1263
01:06:07,631 --> 01:06:08,832
Quiet
neighborhood?

1264
01:06:08,832 --> 01:06:12,136
Very.
Ah, Mr. Goldberg.

1265
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:13,337
Your cousin around?

1266
01:06:13,337 --> 01:06:14,838
Uh, no,
she's not, no.

1267
01:06:14,838 --> 01:06:16,606
Hi, Marty.
Good to see you.

1268
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:19,143
Jessie, these are
the Bratesmans.

1269
01:06:19,143 --> 01:06:21,545
Hi.
Hi.

1270
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:24,448
Marty, could you people
come back later?

1271
01:06:24,448 --> 01:06:27,351
The Bratesmans here
drove from Philadelphia.

1272
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:28,718
They're very motivated.

1273
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:30,854
Just give us an hour.

1274
01:06:30,854 --> 01:06:32,056
We have
cleaning to do.

1275
01:06:32,056 --> 01:06:33,490
Really, Jess,

1276
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,060
the Bratesmans don't mind
if it's a little untidy.

1277
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:38,028
Fine, fine, fine.

1278
01:06:39,663 --> 01:06:41,731
We'll be back.

1279
01:06:45,535 --> 01:06:46,703
You got a minute?

1280
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:49,339
Well...

1281
01:06:49,339 --> 01:06:53,077
Peedi, I don't know
how to start. Uh...

1282
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:54,444
I, um...

1283
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:57,414
are you comfortable?

1284
01:06:57,414 --> 01:06:58,648
I'm o.K.

1285
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:00,617
I was just wondering.

1286
01:07:00,617 --> 01:07:04,054
I don't know how
to say this. I...

1287
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,625
what does Peedi
stand for?

1288
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,627
Oh, I never tell
anybody that.

1289
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,929
Please tell me.

1290
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:16,200
Penelope.

1291
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:18,735
Penelope.

1292
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,372
Penelope Diane.

1293
01:07:28,178 --> 01:07:30,580
May I call you
Penelope?

1294
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:33,183
I'll have to think
about that.

1295
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,588
At night...

1296
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:40,424
when I'm falling asleep

1297
01:07:40,424 --> 01:07:42,359
with my pillow
under my arm,

1298
01:07:42,359 --> 01:07:46,029
wishing it was you...

1299
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:50,100
in my mind,
can I call you Penelope?

1300
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:53,770
Can I touch you,
Penelope?

1301
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:55,205
Oh...

1302
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:56,406
Harry.

1303
01:07:56,406 --> 01:07:59,743
( Marvin )
Harry! Where's that wrench?

1304
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:01,545
Ugh...

1305
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,650
Hey, what's
your problem?

1306
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:09,319
Oh, I-- I'm handcuffed.

1307
01:08:09,319 --> 01:08:11,321
( telephone rings )

1308
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:12,822
Wait. I'll get it.

1309
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:14,824
I said I'll get it.

1310
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,361
( ring )

1311
01:08:19,196 --> 01:08:22,766
( ring )

1312
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:23,800
Rutledge residence.

1313
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:26,170
Lyle? Willis.
We need to talk.

1314
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,604
I mean a real dialogue.

1315
01:08:27,604 --> 01:08:28,672
I'll kill you.

1316
01:08:28,672 --> 01:08:30,507
I understand
your hostility.

1317
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:32,509
I'm sorry
about shooting you.

1318
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:34,711
I've got a solution
where everybody wins.

1319
01:08:34,711 --> 01:08:36,580
I'm still going
to kill you.

1320
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:38,515
Who is this?
Who is it?

1321
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:39,849
Embry.

1322
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:43,353
Tell him
he's a dead man.

1323
01:08:43,353 --> 01:08:45,222
Marvin says
hello, Willis.

1324
01:08:45,222 --> 01:08:48,492
Listen, I-- I just want
to work out a deal

1325
01:08:48,492 --> 01:08:50,294
where nobody gets
killed, O.K.?

1326
01:08:50,294 --> 01:08:51,661
He wants a deal.

1327
01:08:51,661 --> 01:08:52,862
We'll rip
his arms off.

1328
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,399
Agree to anything.
Agree to anything.

1329
01:08:55,399 --> 01:08:57,467
How about
we meet someplace?

1330
01:08:57,467 --> 01:09:00,337
Where did you have
in mind, Willis?

1331
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,701
You heard about
Tricks Bissell's
money, right?

1332
01:09:31,701 --> 01:09:33,403
We heard a rumor.

1333
01:09:33,403 --> 01:09:35,505
Tricks wanted something
done with half of it,

1334
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:38,575
but the rest of it
we could split if--

1335
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:40,076
Now who's this one?

1336
01:09:40,076 --> 01:09:43,647
Now they have three.
How can they afford
three people?

1337
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,749
I got to learn
to read lips.

1338
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:49,453
Lyle, you've got
to work harder on
those hostile feelings.

1339
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:51,855
You shot him
with an arrow.

1340
01:09:51,855 --> 01:09:53,723
You blew up
my apartment!

1341
01:09:53,723 --> 01:09:56,059
That was Marvin.
Uhh...

1342
01:09:56,059 --> 01:09:57,261
Oh.

1343
01:09:57,261 --> 01:09:59,429
He gets violent
without his pills.

1344
01:09:59,429 --> 01:10:01,565
Maybe you
could write him
a prescription.

1345
01:10:01,565 --> 01:10:04,734
What you did
was very aggressive.

1346
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:06,403
You tried to kill us!

1347
01:10:06,403 --> 01:10:08,838
Oh, now you're
exaggerating.

1348
01:10:08,838 --> 01:10:11,575
Lyle...

1349
01:10:11,575 --> 01:10:13,577
remember the progress
we were making

1350
01:10:13,577 --> 01:10:15,312
about your anger
at your older brother?

1351
01:10:15,312 --> 01:10:17,781
Leave my brother
out of this.

1352
01:10:17,781 --> 01:10:19,816
We're not
your patients anymore.

1353
01:10:19,816 --> 01:10:22,652
Oh, good, Willis.
Who's this?

1354
01:10:26,089 --> 01:10:27,557
What's going on here?

1355
01:10:27,557 --> 01:10:30,794
Albert, these, uh,
these men are interested
in the house.

1356
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:33,363
This is Albert's house.

1357
01:10:33,363 --> 01:10:34,698
Why are they so dirty?

1358
01:10:34,698 --> 01:10:36,500
None of your business,
asshole.

1359
01:10:36,500 --> 01:10:37,801
That's O.K., Lyle.

1360
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:39,235
( Albert )
Where's Jessie?

1361
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,704
No, no, no, no.

1362
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:42,171
Don't go back there.

1363
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:43,807
Don't-- Don't
touch me, O.K.?

1364
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:45,008
Why not?

1365
01:10:45,008 --> 01:10:47,344
Take another step,
I'll kill you.

1366
01:10:47,344 --> 01:10:49,846
Albert, why not
come back later

1367
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:52,916
when these gentlemen
are through looking
through the house?

1368
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:54,718
Run a credit check
on this guy.

1369
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:01,525
Why'd you let him leave?
Why'd you?

1370
01:11:01,525 --> 01:11:03,627
We want the money,
Willis.

1371
01:11:03,627 --> 01:11:05,295
O.K., O.K., O.K.

1372
01:11:07,731 --> 01:11:09,933
How about we
divide up my share?

1373
01:11:09,933 --> 01:11:11,301
Huh?

1374
01:11:11,301 --> 01:11:13,670
There's plenty
to go around.

1375
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:16,573
That sounds like
a good idea, Willis.

1376
01:11:16,573 --> 01:11:18,375
O.K.

1377
01:11:28,151 --> 01:11:29,686
We bought some time.

1378
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,524
He didn't buy it.

1379
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:41,565
( explosion )

1380
01:11:41,565 --> 01:11:42,999
Aah!

1381
01:11:42,999 --> 01:11:44,534
Aah!

1382
01:11:44,534 --> 01:11:45,802
( coughing )

1383
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,737
Oh, wow! Oh!

1384
01:11:52,409 --> 01:11:54,344
( gasps )

1385
01:11:54,344 --> 01:11:56,380
( car horn honks )

1386
01:11:56,380 --> 01:11:58,815
Wimps! We've
got work to do!

1387
01:11:58,815 --> 01:12:00,417
Wasn't that
delicious?

1388
01:12:00,417 --> 01:12:02,486
Marty,
that was no hour.

1389
01:12:02,486 --> 01:12:04,621
Fine.

1390
01:12:04,621 --> 01:12:06,456
You know what,
Mr. Bratesman?

1391
01:12:06,456 --> 01:12:09,325
Let's start
out back, O.K.?

1392
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,827
I like the color.

1393
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:13,963
Oh, yeah.
Goes with your complexion.

1394
01:12:13,963 --> 01:12:15,164
Hmm.

1395
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,838
Landscaping looks good.

1396
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:25,875
We can swing it
if we lock into
low interest rates?

1397
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,911
Dead cats, geometry,
mother...

1398
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:29,078
mother usually works.

1399
01:12:29,078 --> 01:12:30,346
What?
Nothing.

1400
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:32,048
Nothing.

1401
01:12:32,048 --> 01:12:33,617
Nothing works.

1402
01:12:33,617 --> 01:12:36,720
You think she'd
go down 10,000?

1403
01:12:37,854 --> 01:12:39,423
I'll talk to her.

1404
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:41,958
Honey--
Just a minute.

1405
01:12:41,958 --> 01:12:43,627
What about
a second mortgage?

1406
01:12:43,627 --> 01:12:45,128
Did you say
that was possible?

1407
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:47,997
Yes, I think so.

1408
01:12:47,997 --> 01:12:50,900
Why don't you check out
the pool, Phil?

1409
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,436
May I call you Phil?

1410
01:12:52,436 --> 01:12:54,070
Sure. Good idea.

1411
01:12:54,070 --> 01:12:56,139
I don't think--

1412
01:12:56,139 --> 01:12:59,375
We'll probably have to
do a little sprucing up.

1413
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,445
Are you crazy?

1414
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:04,113
Nice...
How expensive is it
to maintain a pool?

1415
01:13:04,113 --> 01:13:06,950
Oh, pennies, really.
Ha ha ha!

1416
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:10,019
Honey, look at
this diving board.

1417
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:12,756
Will you stop?
What's wrong with you?

1418
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:14,924
I'm trying to get help.

1419
01:13:14,924 --> 01:13:16,693
You are?
Yeah.

1420
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,462
So am I.

1421
01:13:18,462 --> 01:13:19,796
We meet Wednesdays.

1422
01:13:19,796 --> 01:13:21,164
We meet Tuesdays.

1423
01:13:21,164 --> 01:13:24,100
Am I hurting you?
Just a little.

1424
01:13:24,100 --> 01:13:25,869
Mmm.

1425
01:13:28,071 --> 01:13:31,708
Never mind my name.
Just tell me
your reward policy.

1426
01:13:31,708 --> 01:13:35,178
If it's illegal,
it's your civic duty
to report it.

1427
01:13:35,178 --> 01:13:37,146
Get a life.

1428
01:13:40,484 --> 01:13:42,051
Are these the men?

1429
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:46,355
Yeah, these are
the guys right here.

1430
01:13:46,355 --> 01:13:48,024
( thud )

1431
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,201
J-J-J-J-J-

1432
01:13:58,201 --> 01:13:59,903
Jessie!

1433
01:14:05,441 --> 01:14:06,676
Oh.

1434
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:09,312
Penelope, can I
get you anything?

1435
01:14:09,312 --> 01:14:11,180
Oh! A key.

1436
01:14:11,180 --> 01:14:13,650
Norm has the keys.

1437
01:14:13,650 --> 01:14:16,920
Oh, he just wants
to protect you, baby.

1438
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:19,589
I'd do the same thing
if you were mine.

1439
01:14:19,589 --> 01:14:20,790
Like this?

1440
01:14:20,790 --> 01:14:22,158
No.

1441
01:14:22,158 --> 01:14:23,459
Like this.

1442
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:27,163
Uh-- Oh, Harry,
Harry, Harry.

1443
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:29,332
Ohh.

1444
01:14:29,332 --> 01:14:31,134
Penelope...

1445
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:36,072
I'm going to go
straight for you...

1446
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,074
right after
we get this money.

1447
01:14:38,074 --> 01:14:40,009
Oh, Harry.

1448
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:41,310
Oh...

1449
01:14:44,548 --> 01:14:45,782
All right.

1450
01:14:45,782 --> 01:14:48,184
O.K. Come to Papa.

1451
01:14:48,184 --> 01:14:49,886
Uhh.
( choking )

1452
01:14:49,886 --> 01:14:51,220
Don't ever say that.

1453
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,622
O.K.

1454
01:14:52,622 --> 01:14:54,023
Uh, I'm sorry.

1455
01:14:54,023 --> 01:14:55,692
Sorry, Norm.

1456
01:14:55,692 --> 01:14:56,893
O.K., Marvin,
get your gun.

1457
01:14:56,893 --> 01:14:58,094
I'll get my gun.

1458
01:14:58,094 --> 01:14:59,462
Honey,

1459
01:14:59,462 --> 01:15:00,664
be careful.

1460
01:15:00,664 --> 01:15:03,099
Don't worry.

1461
01:15:03,099 --> 01:15:04,333
Yeah.

1462
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,835
Yeah.

1463
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,971
It's party time!

1464
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:10,874
Whoa!
Aah!

1465
01:15:22,586 --> 01:15:24,754
Whoa!
Hey.

1466
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:27,190
The power.
Did you back this up?

1467
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:28,825
You should've.

1468
01:15:28,825 --> 01:15:31,595
Now look what you did.

1469
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:38,668
Aah.

1470
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:40,637
Honey...

1471
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:44,774
Marvin!

1472
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:46,275
Marvin,
come on!

1473
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,845
Aah!

1474
01:15:56,085 --> 01:15:58,755
This is 
 the Cherry Hill Police!

1475
01:15:58,755 --> 01:16:00,089
You're surrounded!

1476
01:16:00,089 --> 01:16:02,091
Come out 
 with your hands up!

1477
01:16:02,091 --> 01:16:03,226
No.

1478
01:16:03,226 --> 01:16:04,728
No.

1479
01:16:06,796 --> 01:16:08,031
Go!

1480
01:16:08,031 --> 01:16:09,599
Positions!

1481
01:16:13,837 --> 01:16:15,304
Hold your positions!

1482
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,540
Form cover!

1483
01:16:21,177 --> 01:16:22,779
You in the rear!

1484
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,648
What is it?

1485
01:16:24,648 --> 01:16:27,116
It's S.W.A.T.

1486
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:29,252
What's going on here?

1487
01:16:31,354 --> 01:16:35,191
Somebody please tell us
what is going on here.

1488
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:38,061
Back off, or
I start killing people!

1489
01:16:38,061 --> 01:16:40,029
What's the landscape man--

1490
01:16:40,029 --> 01:16:43,099
It's Marvin Boyd.
He's done time
for armed robbery.

1491
01:16:43,099 --> 01:16:45,702
We're coming out
with the lady!

1492
01:16:45,702 --> 01:16:47,904
Anybody follows,
she gets it!

1493
01:16:47,904 --> 01:16:49,105
Where is she?

1494
01:16:49,105 --> 01:16:50,339
Can't get her loose.

1495
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:52,541
Go get the key.

1496
01:16:52,541 --> 01:16:53,977
Oh. Norm's got the key.

1497
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:55,845
I don't know where he is.
I think he drowned.

1498
01:16:55,845 --> 01:16:58,014
Ahh, Normie.

1499
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:00,283
Ahh, Normie drowned.

1500
01:17:00,283 --> 01:17:02,819
Oh, oh, Harry.

1501
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:05,789
Uh, you're doing
a wonderful job, Harry.

1502
01:17:05,789 --> 01:17:08,792
I love you, Penelope.

1503
01:17:11,327 --> 01:17:13,429
Ohh...

1504
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:34,684
He's staying
with the broad.

1505
01:17:34,684 --> 01:17:36,686
Yeah? That's his choice.

1506
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:38,121
Let's go.

1507
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,426
You look nice.

1508
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:47,130
Thanks.

1509
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:55,104
Here we go.

1510
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:56,305
Keep your head down.

1511
01:17:56,305 --> 01:17:58,341
How can I drive
with my head down?

1512
01:17:58,341 --> 01:17:59,743
There's Mrs. Rutledge.

1513
01:17:59,743 --> 01:18:01,711
Want me
to pick him off?

1514
01:18:01,711 --> 01:18:04,147
No. You heard him.

1515
01:18:04,147 --> 01:18:05,381
Men, hold your fire.

1516
01:18:05,381 --> 01:18:07,884
O.K., 
 we're letting you go.

1517
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,385
We're out of here,
baby.

1518
01:18:09,385 --> 01:18:10,920
Shut up.

1519
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:18,862
( car won't start )

1520
01:18:18,862 --> 01:18:20,563
Sounds like the battery.

1521
01:18:20,563 --> 01:18:22,832
Oh, I need a pill.

1522
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:25,334
Aah!

1523
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:26,903
D-don't shoot!

1524
01:18:26,903 --> 01:18:28,104
Hold your fire!

1525
01:18:28,104 --> 01:18:29,739
Don't shoot!

1526
01:18:29,739 --> 01:18:31,841
Oh, no.
Oh.

1527
01:18:31,841 --> 01:18:34,878
She's not in the car.
Get 'em, guys.

1528
01:18:34,878 --> 01:18:36,813
( Peedi )
Aah!

1529
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:37,914
Are you hurt?
No.

1530
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:40,383
Are you sure?
Are you O .K., ma'am?

1531
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:42,118
There's a man inside.

1532
01:18:42,118 --> 01:18:44,888
Do you need
a medic?
No.

1533
01:18:44,888 --> 01:18:46,122
Are you sure
you're o.K.?

1534
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:50,459
Damn it! Let me talk!

1535
01:18:50,459 --> 01:18:52,328
There's a man inside,

1536
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:54,964
and-- And
he saved my life.

1537
01:18:54,964 --> 01:18:57,366
He-- He--
He wants to come out.

1538
01:18:57,366 --> 01:18:59,435
He-- He wants
to go straight.

1539
01:18:59,435 --> 01:19:03,472
He-- He-- He wants a piece
of the American dream.

1540
01:19:03,472 --> 01:19:06,009
He-- He-- He makes
great cappuccino.

1541
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:07,310
He--

1542
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:10,346
He's afraid that you're
going to kill him.

1543
01:19:10,346 --> 01:19:11,815
O.K. Hold your fire.

1544
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:13,549
Hold your fire!

1545
01:19:13,549 --> 01:19:15,985
Hold your fire!

1546
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:18,121
Uh, Harry?

1547
01:19:18,121 --> 01:19:20,456
Uh-- Harry?

1548
01:19:20,456 --> 01:19:22,859
It-- It's O.K., honey.

1549
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:24,193
Come on, honey.

1550
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:26,062
Come on out.

1551
01:19:27,396 --> 01:19:29,999
( Captain )
Handsome Harry.

1552
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,937
Don't-- Don't hurt him.

1553
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,509
Oh, Har...Harry.

1554
01:19:40,509 --> 01:19:43,012
Mrs. Rutledge,
where is your husband?

1555
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:45,248
Your husband,
Mrs. Rutledge.

1556
01:19:50,019 --> 01:19:52,956
Tricks was telling
the truth, huh?

1557
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:55,024
I was
so wrong about you.

1558
01:19:55,024 --> 01:19:57,961
$8 1/2 million, Jessie.

1559
01:20:00,163 --> 01:20:02,999
When you're through
with that lovey-dovey shit,

1560
01:20:02,999 --> 01:20:04,200
hand that to me.

1561
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,468
Norm?

1562
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:08,271
Norman, what
are you doing?

1563
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:09,705
The suitcase. Now.

1564
01:20:09,705 --> 01:20:11,574
Are they making
you do this?

1565
01:20:11,574 --> 01:20:12,842
Come on.

1566
01:20:12,842 --> 01:20:14,844
Does Peedi know
about this?

1567
01:20:14,844 --> 01:20:16,245
Hand it over!

1568
01:20:16,245 --> 01:20:18,281
It's spoken for
by several parties.

1569
01:20:18,281 --> 01:20:20,216
Now!

1570
01:20:22,385 --> 01:20:23,987
Come on!

1571
01:20:30,559 --> 01:20:31,928
That's far enough.

1572
01:20:31,928 --> 01:20:34,830
Marty!

1573
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:38,134
On the floor,
both of you!

1574
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:40,769
Look, it's not
her fault, O.K.?

1575
01:20:40,769 --> 01:20:42,771
Just let her go.

1576
01:20:42,771 --> 01:20:45,208
Just take her with you
or something, all right?

1577
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:48,344
But just don't kill
anybody, o.K.?

1578
01:20:48,344 --> 01:20:50,146
How about it, Jess?

1579
01:20:50,146 --> 01:20:53,482
That was very nice
of you.

1580
01:20:56,319 --> 01:21:00,256
Oh, Marty, no, no.
I-- I couldn't leave
Willis behind.

1581
01:21:00,256 --> 01:21:03,059
Then shut up and turn
around, both of you!

1582
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:05,161
You try being realtors.

1583
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:08,898
Me? I'm through
selling ugly houses
to stupid people.

1584
01:21:08,898 --> 01:21:11,234
Uhh!

1585
01:21:11,234 --> 01:21:14,003
I don't think
your house is ugly.

1586
01:21:19,108 --> 01:21:21,310
That's far enough.

1587
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:26,315
That's my daughter.

1588
01:21:26,315 --> 01:21:28,484
That's her daughter.

1589
01:21:28,484 --> 01:21:31,887
H-h-hey,
somebody stop him!

1590
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,089
Ooh!

1591
01:21:33,089 --> 01:21:36,025
The biggest crook
of them all.

1592
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:38,261
Freeze!

1593
01:21:38,261 --> 01:21:40,363
Swan needs
a new bike.

1594
01:21:40,363 --> 01:21:44,067
I figured it'd
be safer if nobody
knew I was alive.

1595
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:46,970
Well, I think
the insurance company--

1596
01:21:48,571 --> 01:21:50,373
Oh.

1597
01:21:50,373 --> 01:21:52,808
Oh, God.

1598
01:21:54,077 --> 01:21:55,878
Oh, God.

1599
01:21:55,878 --> 01:21:57,713
Oh...

1600
01:22:01,985 --> 01:22:03,486
well, I mean-- I mean--

1601
01:22:03,486 --> 01:22:05,488
Well... Well...

1602
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:06,922
Look at--

1603
01:22:11,527 --> 01:22:13,496
It's just-- It's just--

1604
01:22:13,496 --> 01:22:16,432
It's just all rotten!

1605
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:21,704
Goodbye.

1606
01:22:21,704 --> 01:22:24,473
You got
a great future, kid.

1607
01:22:26,375 --> 01:22:28,011
Hey, Norm.

1608
01:22:28,011 --> 01:22:29,212
Sayonara, baby.

1609
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:30,613
Peedi, we can
work this out.

1610
01:22:41,057 --> 01:22:43,092
I'll write.

1611
01:22:48,064 --> 01:22:50,466
All right,
that's far enough,
you Casanova.

1612
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:51,734
Jeffrey!

1613
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,636
He's fooling around
with my wife.

1614
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:55,038
No!
No!

1615
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:56,505
You knew
his phone number!

1616
01:22:56,505 --> 01:22:59,608
I don't care
who she slept with.
Give us the gun.

1617
01:22:59,608 --> 01:23:03,179
His phone number was
on the "for sale" sign!

1618
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:06,649
Just...sign?

1619
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:08,451
Yes.

1620
01:23:10,286 --> 01:23:12,221
Oh.

1621
01:23:12,221 --> 01:23:14,290
I, uh...

1622
01:23:16,559 --> 01:23:18,094
Well, I'm sorry. I--

1623
01:23:18,094 --> 01:23:19,328
Uhh!

1624
01:23:22,198 --> 01:23:23,399
Ugh!

1625
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:25,534
Hey!

1626
01:23:25,534 --> 01:23:27,736
Hi. I'm Marvin Boyd.

1627
01:23:27,736 --> 01:23:29,305
Ma-Marty Rollins.

1628
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:31,307
You never been
in the joint, huh?

1629
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,209
The joint?
No, never been.

1630
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:36,579
Well, come on.
We'll sit together.

1631
01:23:59,735 --> 01:24:01,937
Look, uh...

1632
01:24:01,937 --> 01:24:04,673
I'm sorry about
the way things
turned out.

1633
01:24:04,673 --> 01:24:05,941
I, uh...

1634
01:24:05,941 --> 01:24:09,078
No. I gambled. I lost.

1635
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:12,115
Yeah.

1636
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,285
I met you.

1637
01:24:20,523 --> 01:24:22,358
Is that good or bad?

1638
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:23,726
You tell me.

1639
01:24:45,981 --> 01:24:47,850
Huh?

1640
01:24:53,156 --> 01:24:55,324
Oh...

1641
01:24:55,324 --> 01:24:56,325
Oh...

1642
01:24:56,325 --> 01:24:57,993
Oh!

1643
01:24:57,993 --> 01:24:59,695
Oh!

1644
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,309
Do you have
Louise's address?

1645
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:14,643
Uh-huh.

1646
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:18,514
* Ice will melt *

1647
01:25:18,514 --> 01:25:20,516
* Water will boil *

1648
01:25:20,516 --> 01:25:22,685
* Shouldn't you and I *

1649
01:25:22,685 --> 01:25:24,520
* Shake off 
 This mortal coil? *

1650
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,522
* It's bigger than us *

1651
01:25:26,522 --> 01:25:30,193
* You don't have 
 To worry about it *

1652
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:34,863
* Ready or not *

1653
01:25:34,863 --> 01:25:36,899
* Here comes the plot *

1654
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:40,603
* You feel lucky when 
 You know where you are *

1655
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:43,539
* You know 
 It's gonna come true *

1656
01:25:43,539 --> 01:25:45,140
( crash )

1657
01:25:48,811 --> 01:25:50,813
* It's only natural *

1658
01:25:50,813 --> 01:25:53,316
* That I should want to *

1659
01:25:53,316 --> 01:25:55,584
* Be there with you *

1660
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,688
* It's only natural *

1661
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:02,758
* That you should 
 Feel the same way, too *

1662
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:08,331
* It's easy 
 When you don't try *

1663
01:26:08,331 --> 01:26:10,065
* Goin' on 
 First impressions *

1664
01:26:10,065 --> 01:26:12,067
* Man in a cage *

1665
01:26:12,067 --> 01:26:13,736
* Has made 
 His confession *

1666
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:16,339
* Now you've seen me 
 At my worst *

1667
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:20,008
* And it won't be the last time 
 I'm down there *

1668
01:26:22,845 --> 01:26:24,112
* I want you to know *

1669
01:26:24,112 --> 01:26:26,849
* I feel completely 
 At ease *

1670
01:26:26,849 --> 01:26:28,851
* You read me 
 Like a book *

1671
01:26:28,851 --> 01:26:31,854
* That's fallin' down 
 Between your knees *

1672
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,188
* Please *

1673
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:36,525
* Let me have 
 My way with you *

1674
01:26:38,294 --> 01:26:40,329
* It's only natural *

1675
01:26:40,329 --> 01:26:42,598
* That I should want to *

1676
01:26:42,598 --> 01:26:44,967
* Be there with you *

1677
01:26:46,469 --> 01:26:49,137
* It's only natural *

1678
01:26:49,137 --> 01:26:52,308
* That you should 
 Feel the same way, too *

1679
01:26:54,610 --> 01:26:56,979
* It's circumstantial *

1680
01:26:56,979 --> 01:26:59,648
* There's nothing written 
 In the sky *

1681
01:26:59,648 --> 01:27:05,988
* And we don't even 
 Have to try *

1682
01:27:11,660 --> 01:27:14,162
* And we'll be 
 Shakin' like mud *

1683
01:27:14,162 --> 01:27:16,164
* Buildings of glass *

1684
01:27:16,164 --> 01:27:17,666
* Sink into the bay *

1685
01:27:17,666 --> 01:27:19,935
* We'll be under 
 The rocks again *

1686
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:22,004
* You don't have to say *

1687
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:23,839
* I know you're afraid *

1688
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:26,008
* It's only natural *

1689
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30,846
* That I should wanna 
 Be there with you *

1690
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:34,683
* It's only natural *

1691
01:27:34,683 --> 01:27:37,520
* That you should 
 Feel the same way, too *

1692
01:27:40,356 --> 01:27:43,859
* It's circumstantial *

1693
01:27:43,859 --> 01:27:46,862
* It's something 
 I was born to *

1694
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:51,867
* It's only natural *

1695
01:27:51,867 --> 01:27:55,304
* Can I help it 
 If I want to? *

1696
01:27:55,304 --> 01:27:59,207
* Ooh *

1697
01:28:10,218 --> 01:28:13,722
* Can I help it 
 If I want to? **
