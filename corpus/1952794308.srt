2
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:20,037
The light should be here.

3
00:01:22,081 --> 00:01:26,043
Shit! God! That dark!

4
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:41,475
What 's so dead here.

5
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:45,646
I put some music?

6
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:49,399
Can I...? What kind of music do you like?

7
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,819
Something soft.

8
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,341
You can take your coat... if you want.

9
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:35,445
You're wet.

10
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:38,365
I think I did too.

11
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,118
I'll put in another room.

12
00:03:24,912 --> 00:03:28,331
It may be wine?

13
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,500
Wine is cool.

14
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,196
Wait. Toma.

15
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:03,617
Health

16
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,120
Health

17
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:22,093
The music sound okay? If I do not like...

18
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,544
I never danced before with another man.

19
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,966
Have you ever been with another guy before?

20
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,886
Yes, once.

21
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,556
When I was a teenager.

22
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,892
My God, was...

23
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,479
What?

24
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:18,566
We did it in the basement of his house.

25
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,488
He was my friend, Alexander.

26
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:25,407
Actually, it was my best friend.

27
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:33,248
We had... 15?... 16?

28
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,920
I thought I was in love with him.

29
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,839
When I talked to him...

30
00:05:41,757 --> 00:05:43,174
looking in your eyes...

31
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,261
I love you...

32
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,431
What happened?

33
00:05:52,184 --> 00:05:54,019
He sent me to hell.

34
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:59,941
I remember that running away,
call me a bugger, bugger

35
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:05,196
Gay shit gay shit gay shit.

36
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,366
After that I never went back to see him.

37
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,119
He moved.

38
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,376
My first one was my uncle.

39
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,879
Uncle Charlie.

40
00:06:21,797 --> 00:06:24,299
Uncle Charlie?

41
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,720
The friend of my father's drinking.
We called him Uncle Charlie.

42
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,723
How did it happen?

43
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:37,020
One night he walked into my
room and ate me.

44
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,565
How old were you?

45
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:42,567
Twelve.

46
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,572
- His father heard?
- Yes.

47
00:06:47,823 --> 00:06:50,325
What did he do?

48
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,828
He took a knife and took it.

49
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,332
I mean that his father stabbed him?

50
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:01,085
No. He has recovered. He charged $ 20.

51
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,838
- No!
- Yes!

52
00:07:04,089 --> 00:07:08,150
He said if someone were to fuck her son,
at least it would make money.

53
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,178
I think he was crazy.

54
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,181
Jesus.

55
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:17,268
And Uncle Charlie had friends too...

56
00:07:19,688 --> 00:07:22,190
I mean that their father prostituted?

57
00:07:23,275 --> 00:07:25,443
More or less.

58
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,118
Is more relaxed now?

59
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,204
Yes

60
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,790
Yes

61
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:43,795
Do you like me?

62
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:48,216
Yes .. Yes, I like.

63
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,303
When we get off?

64
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:06,442
Okay?

65
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,196
It hurts.

66
00:08:11,448 --> 00:08:13,449
Shall I stop?

67
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:17,620
No. It's fine. Just go slowly.

68
00:08:47,651 --> 00:08:49,610
Like it?

69
00:08:49,778 --> 00:08:52,697
- Yes
- Tell me how you like.

70
00:08:52,948 --> 00:08:54,198
I like it.

71
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,285
Tell me to fuck you. Say 'fuck me. "

72
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,454
- Fuck me.
- Say "fuck me".

73
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,374
Fuck me, fuck me, my God!

74
00:09:26,565 --> 00:09:30,234
- You will enjoy?
- Yes! Yes!

75
00:10:53,026 --> 00:10:55,027
Was it good?

76
00:10:55,362 --> 00:10:57,280
Yes

77
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:59,615
Legal.

78
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:05,538
I enjoyed touching it.

79
00:11:05,789 --> 00:11:07,582
Sei. That feels good.

80
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,168
How did this?

81
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:15,965
Magic. If I tell you,
I have to kill you.

82
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,452
You told me your name.

83
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:46,621
Yes, I said.

84
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,707
Maybe then forgotten.

85
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,628
It's Alex

86
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,713
Fuck you!

87
00:11:55,964 --> 00:11:57,798
It's my name.

88
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,513
It was the name of my friend.

89
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:10,019
What turned away when you said you loved him?

90
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:12,688
Is.

91
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:16,025
Alex is your real name?

92
00:12:16,651 --> 00:12:18,652
His real name is John?

93
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,157
No. .. It's George.

94
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:26,994
George was in Russia.

95
00:12:28,997 --> 00:12:31,916
But now in America is John.

96
00:12:35,837 --> 00:12:38,255
True story about your father?

97
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,472
How do you feel?

98
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,184
I feel free.

99
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:55,147
Free?

100
00:12:55,982 --> 00:12:57,900
Yes

101
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,321
Legal.

102
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,741
Yes

103
00:13:23,635 --> 00:13:25,594
Yes

104
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:07,548
Holy shit. Pig shit.

105
00:16:09,926 --> 00:16:11,885
Eddy?

106
00:16:15,932 --> 00:16:18,684
My God! It's you!

107
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,771
What is homo?

108
00:16:23,606 --> 00:16:26,442
Come here! Give me a kiss!

109
00:16:29,988 --> 00:16:33,532
You bitch! You are in my building
and did not give me a hi!

110
00:16:33,783 --> 00:16:35,951
Okay. I forgive you.

111
00:16:36,953 --> 00:16:38,287
Let me look.

112
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,517
"Shit!
- What?

113
00:16:40,518 --> 00:16:43,518
My God! You need to login.

114
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,919
Remember Jacob?
The skinny fag who told you?

115
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,255
He saw his picture and liked it a lot.

116
00:16:48,339 --> 00:16:52,000
It's in my house now with friends.
We have some...

117
00:16:56,472 --> 00:17:00,893
Eddy! It's me! Leon!

118
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,228
Do not pretend you do not know me.

119
00:17:03,396 --> 00:17:06,272
I will never talk to you.
You hit my heart.

120
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:13,030
- Leon! My God!
- I know! All right?

121
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,199
Shit! As time passed?

122
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:17,910
I do not know. Do not embarrass me with time.

123
00:17:17,952 --> 00:17:20,037
Join! I have coke!

124
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,873
Coca-coca to the ho-ho. Come on!

125
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,834
We worship you and it will be wonderful.

126
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,213
I do not know. It's a little late.

127
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,591
No school tomorrow, bitch?

128
00:17:32,675 --> 00:17:37,346
Oh, naughty! Want to be
rested for the teacher, right?

129
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,641
You like those nerds with
big dick, huh bitch?

130
00:17:40,808 --> 00:17:43,185
Come in, seriously, we miss you.

131
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:46,980
Come on! Come on!

132
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,357
Okay.

133
00:17:48,608 --> 00:17:49,858
"Yeah?
-Yes!

134
00:17:50,068 --> 00:17:52,277
Grab it, bitch. Make
as I say.

135
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,153
Come on!

136
00:17:53,321 --> 00:17:55,364
Sexy ass down the hall.

137
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,033
Bip. Bip Bip.

138
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,081
I'm back!

139
00:18:04,248 --> 00:18:06,875
Silence because I have not talked.
Listen up girls:

140
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,251
I have a surprise for you.

141
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,421
I brought someone with me. Prepared?

142
00:18:13,089 --> 00:18:14,216
It is the Eddy! Remember?

143
00:18:14,425 --> 00:18:16,426
I've talked to you Eddy.

144
00:18:19,347 --> 00:18:21,682
Take off your jacket and stand there a moment.

145
00:18:21,933 --> 00:18:23,950
Take the liquor, nut. Let's drink.

146
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,400
It is good to drink to
last drop, I'll check.

147
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,400
This is Gary, our friend
writer and an alcoholic, right Gary?

148
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:35,450
Now, Eddy, you're right here...
At center stage.

149
00:18:36,114 --> 00:18:38,115
This is Eddy.
I always spoke of him, remember?

150
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,241
Hello?

151
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:41,368
An adult is talking, do not remember?

152
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:43,500
Legal. Anyway
nobody listens to me.

153
00:18:43,538 --> 00:18:45,414
Sure, you talk too much. How to cope?

154
00:18:45,665 --> 00:18:46,748
My God! You're so cute!

155
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,917
Give me a little coke, bitch.

156
00:18:48,918 --> 00:18:51,620
I went out for 4 minutes, I left everything
ready and you took over.

157
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,921
Eddy goes, let's smell.

158
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,386
Christ! What they did to
get this shit?

159
00:18:59,637 --> 00:19:00,721
Eddy, smells.

160
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,933
Eddy is the best blowjobs...

161
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,685
this fucking universe.

162
00:19:06,936 --> 00:19:08,437
And he makes no noise.

163
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:11,189
He has killed a pimp in
Romania or something.

164
00:19:12,491 --> 00:19:13,275
Eddy deep throat.

165
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,943
It's his new name from now on.

166
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:15,904
Eddy

167
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:16,805
throat

168
00:19:16,806 --> 00:19:17,806
deep!

169
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:18,613
Take a sniff!

170
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,453
I just remember.
But it is not the best part.

171
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,914
Can I tell?

172
00:19:28,249 --> 00:19:29,249
Sure.

173
00:19:29,417 --> 00:19:30,876
Ok, I'll tell them.

174
00:19:31,377 --> 00:19:36,131
You see the only son of... wait...

175
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,969
Samuel Franklin Dobson, the former mayor.

176
00:19:41,053 --> 00:19:43,930
Samuel Franklin Fuck Dobson
is not it, Eddy?

177
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:49,311
And you tell them what you
said when he found it.

178
00:19:50,688 --> 00:19:52,355
Account you. Do you like this
story more than me.

179
00:19:52,607 --> 00:19:53,607
Suit yourself, queer.

180
00:19:54,692 --> 00:19:58,361
They came and raided a large
mansion terrorist, you know?

181
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:02,032
And yet deep throat
were vestiges of Go-Go.

182
00:20:02,074 --> 00:20:06,661
And Dad was there... blah, blah, blah!
Not my child!

183
00:20:07,955 --> 00:20:09,539
The mayor speaks, speaks, speaks...

184
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:14,211
Then he offers the throat
deep a truck full of money,

185
00:20:14,378 --> 00:20:16,546
university education, a job...

186
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:18,673
And how is deep throat, you know...

187
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:23,553
Put end to this depraved life...
sinful to eat assholes.

188
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:27,349
Eddy said...

189
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,518
Father! I am as God made me,

190
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:33,230
and then you'd be a great sin.

191
00:20:33,314 --> 00:20:34,975
I know the story!

192
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:37,076
"Kids Program"

193
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,194
Keanu Reeves, River Phoenix.

194
00:20:39,445 --> 00:20:40,528
Shut your mouth!

195
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:44,366
I saw, you saw!
All the world saw gays.

196
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,200
I did not.

197
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,619
Yes, he is the son of the mayor, the governor's son...

198
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:51,164
See? This is the reason
for which no one speaks to you.

199
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:52,999
Is it because nobody listens.

200
00:20:53,084 --> 00:20:55,850
- If Eddy says that his father was mayor...
"It was prefect!

201
00:20:55,903 --> 00:20:57,837
Thanks Eddy. So
His father was the mayor.

202
00:20:58,005 --> 00:21:01,958
Yeah, okay, okay. This is the
fact that he has now.

203
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:03,843
"Want to go?
-No.

204
00:21:04,011 --> 00:21:05,053
So shut up.

205
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:07,847
- Your desires... I'm hearing.
- Shut up!

206
00:21:08,891 --> 00:21:14,229
Bitch! Always have to talk
something that fuck me!

207
00:21:14,438 --> 00:21:17,565
Anyway, the small
Eddy had this great ultimatum:

208
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,901
Or she went to university...

209
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,319
or left the worldly life.

210
00:21:21,904 --> 00:21:24,948
And she said I am as God made me?

211
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,244
A dirty assholes eater
unexpended swallower?

212
00:21:30,413 --> 00:21:33,206
It is deserted, without a penny!

213
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:36,126
But it has bag! Picks up, it smells!

214
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,502
I'm fine.

215
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:39,587
Who are you?

216
00:21:40,256 --> 00:21:43,675
Drug free! I use to
leading out of the house.

217
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,761
Not Eddy, finished drugs,
go home, you're a machine.

218
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,222
Here! Toma!

219
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:52,100
What's in the bottle?

220
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:53,852
Well ..

221
00:21:54,145 --> 00:21:56,604
"Pants-colada," a
drinks for our guest.

222
00:21:57,815 --> 00:21:59,482
Give a glass to this man.

223
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:02,444
Because you're a man, not Eddy?

224
00:22:03,154 --> 00:22:04,112
Yes

225
00:22:04,363 --> 00:22:06,030
Little Miss Deep Throat.

226
00:22:06,198 --> 00:22:08,658
You are the master clean and sober now.

227
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,118
You are a serious man?

228
00:22:10,411 --> 00:22:11,453
I think I will ever know.

229
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:15,039
Beware of this attitude,
Mr. Dick Prandi.

230
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:17,333
Not big enough
for your ass off.

231
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:24,424
Cheeky, I love it!

232
00:22:24,592 --> 00:22:27,260
Show off your dick
only the head, just the little eye...

233
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:28,511
How?

234
00:22:28,721 --> 00:22:29,471
How?

235
00:22:29,564 --> 00:22:31,714
I'm charging now.
Pay to play.

236
00:22:31,766 --> 00:22:34,267
Oh, no!

237
00:22:34,977 --> 00:22:40,648
My little Eddy grew.
I think I'll cry.

238
00:22:40,816 --> 00:22:42,650
It's hard to see how they go.

239
00:22:43,986 --> 00:22:47,197
No sir!
No longer dance, I'm not pissed.

240
00:22:47,239 --> 00:22:51,576
It's a bitch who acts in good faith.

241
00:22:51,911 --> 00:22:53,828
Only money! Please!

242
00:22:53,829 --> 00:22:56,122
I am an agent of desire.

243
00:22:56,373 --> 00:22:58,291
A what? I like that.

244
00:22:59,126 --> 00:23:02,712
Do not ask me who I was,
so do not ask me to be the same.

245
00:23:02,963 --> 00:23:05,757
Hey, "Grab-stick"! In what movie is?

246
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:09,344
Not a movie. It is Foucault.

247
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:11,179
Who?

248
00:23:11,472 --> 00:23:12,680
No matter.

249
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:19,771
I met him dancing
the runway and thought only pick it up.

250
00:23:20,022 --> 00:23:22,565
I managed to snare you!

251
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,484
Have you been born slut.

252
00:23:24,568 --> 00:23:28,821
I took the boy home and
the rest is history.

253
00:23:30,366 --> 00:23:31,908
They were good times, eh?

254
00:23:31,992 --> 00:23:32,659
Best.

255
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,702
- You made dinner...
-Yes!

256
00:23:34,954 --> 00:23:36,746
We took care of each other, right?

257
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:39,123
Yes, we took care.

258
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:41,542
He was fond of this
boy, but never told him.

259
00:23:41,877 --> 00:23:43,044
He ran for the hills, right?

260
00:23:43,379 --> 00:23:44,379
Ah yes.

261
00:23:45,047 --> 00:23:46,547
We made the party!

262
00:23:47,716 --> 00:23:50,218
We had fun. We spent
day in the sun as they say.

263
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:52,553
They were good times, were not they?

264
00:23:54,265 --> 00:23:54,931
Yes

265
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:59,936
Good times! Fucking good times!

266
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,789
Hey, hey!

267
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:20,748
What?

268
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,125
Dance for us.

269
00:24:23,419 --> 00:24:25,878
Come on. I see you dancing.

270
00:24:25,963 --> 00:24:27,296
Dance for us, River Phoenix.

271
00:24:27,464 --> 00:24:28,965
Shut up!

272
00:24:29,216 --> 00:24:33,761
"My God, have coke in my hands.
-No, it's yours!

273
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,597
No, look.
Want to prepare and snort?

274
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:39,934
Oh, my God!

275
00:24:40,827 --> 00:24:41,644
Dance for us!

276
00:24:41,979 --> 00:24:43,396
No, I do not know.

277
00:24:43,647 --> 00:24:46,649
Come on. Dance for us.
Shows how you do.

278
00:24:53,949 --> 00:24:55,700
Look how lucky Eddy.

279
00:24:55,951 --> 00:24:58,995
Kids 5 dollars!

280
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:02,749
Come on, dance for us.

281
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:04,500
-Ok!
"Yeah?

282
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,002
-Yes.
- Really?

283
00:25:06,253 --> 00:25:07,503
Yes! Why not?

284
00:25:07,588 --> 00:25:10,465
For old-times.
For old-times.

285
00:25:11,066 --> 00:25:13,843
Fucking Technicolor!

286
00:25:14,428 --> 00:25:17,388
- If you move, fag!
- I'm trying, fag!

287
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,640
I'll beat your head with shit!

288
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,686
What are you doing?

289
00:25:24,146 --> 00:25:26,314
Wait for the music.

290
00:25:26,648 --> 00:25:29,484
My God, that impatient.

291
00:25:35,339 --> 00:25:37,658
Remember this? Remember?

292
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,411
Wait, wait! The show begins!

293
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,501
There, ladies and gentlemen.

294
00:25:46,835 --> 00:25:50,215
Eddy neck deep in the house of you.

295
00:25:52,106 --> 00:25:53,216
Good!

296
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:56,469
Come on bitches!

297
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,471
Come on! Not wanting to believe it is!

298
00:25:58,972 --> 00:26:01,891
Shit! Take it!

299
00:26:11,068 --> 00:26:14,946
It smells! It smells!

300
00:26:18,367 --> 00:26:20,326
Shoot!

301
00:26:23,327 --> 00:26:25,327
Go, take it all!

302
00:26:30,671 --> 00:26:32,964
Shoot!

303
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:45,184
Very good, slut!

304
00:26:45,519 --> 00:26:47,478
Yes! Let's see it!

305
00:26:48,063 --> 00:26:50,106
You can!

306
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:53,025
Live in the moment, let's go!

307
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:01,260
Make the paper, Nelly. Let

308
00:28:02,012 --> 00:28:04,597
Dance bitch.

309
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,729
Looks sexy pants-colada.
He is red like a bitch.

310
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:15,149
That's just your ass.

311
00:28:16,193 --> 00:28:18,194
Come on! Bite her!

312
00:28:18,445 --> 00:28:21,197
Now you're going to stick-handle, right?

313
00:28:21,323 --> 00:28:23,949
Go! Dirky is your dick!

314
00:28:24,034 --> 00:28:27,328
Squeeze!

315
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:29,955
Dirty slut!

316
00:29:10,956 --> 00:29:12,373
Eddy.

317
00:29:15,877 --> 00:29:19,380
You're a bitch, not Eddy?

318
00:29:19,381 --> 00:29:24,218
Eeeeddy... Boy bitch.

319
00:29:51,454 --> 00:29:54,415
He told the truth?

320
00:29:54,749 --> 00:29:56,292
who said what?

321
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:58,419
Eddy, the son of the mayor.

322
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,384
I knew it.

323
00:30:06,261 --> 00:30:07,511
I will not say to Leon.

324
00:30:08,430 --> 00:30:09,763
He likes these things, you know.

325
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:12,933
The way things are.

326
00:30:15,937 --> 00:30:18,480
I will not ask your name.

327
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:21,775
No matter... names.

328
00:30:21,818 --> 00:30:23,319
Probably invent one.

329
00:30:26,406 --> 00:30:28,324
But you're beautiful.

330
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:30,743
Thanks.

331
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:35,164
How did you discover?

332
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:39,877
You're too smart to
be one of the boys of Leon.

333
00:30:40,378 --> 00:30:42,129
And do not use drugs.

334
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,133
No. You are not River Phoenix.

335
00:30:47,177 --> 00:30:48,260
You know who you are?

336
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,933
Brad Davis
"Dying in your arms."

337
00:30:56,686 --> 00:30:58,437
You saw "Querelle"?

338
00:30:59,105 --> 00:31:00,939
Shame!

339
00:31:03,443 --> 00:31:05,402
Leon... know...

340
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:11,742
he sees things your way.
As if the past was perfect.

341
00:31:12,952 --> 00:31:14,995
How do you see?

342
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:17,331
See you.

343
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:22,711
Whoever you are,
thinking about me.

344
00:31:28,134 --> 00:31:30,552
So... You really hustler?

345
00:31:32,138 --> 00:31:33,472
Am.

346
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,599
Is it? Has a page on the net? These things?

347
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:38,727
No, not like that kind of thing.

348
00:31:38,978 --> 00:31:41,021
Oh yeah? How do you like?

349
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:46,026
In luck, anonymous. I like adventures.

350
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,862
Agent desire.

351
00:31:48,947 --> 00:31:50,906
Correct.

352
00:31:51,241 --> 00:31:53,158
Right. So...

353
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:56,559
So...?

354
00:31:56,913 --> 00:31:58,914
How much?

355
00:31:58,998 --> 00:32:00,249
What do you want?

356
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:01,875
Suck my dick.

357
00:32:02,043 --> 00:32:04,044
- 50.
- Cool.

358
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,049
Have change for 20 notes?

359
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,426
Joking, joking.

360
00:32:11,678 --> 00:32:13,929
I think we will do up to 60.

361
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:18,350
Come here.

362
00:32:21,187 --> 00:32:24,773
Do not worry about them.
Hardly come here.

363
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:35,927
Fuck.

364
00:33:46,731 --> 00:33:50,984
Fuck.

365
00:34:45,663 --> 00:34:47,198
It truly does suck a cock.

366
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,918
Practice.

367
00:34:52,255 --> 00:34:53,713
Did you come right!

368
00:34:54,006 --> 00:34:54,923
How?

369
00:34:55,091 --> 00:34:57,050
It feels good, I like.

370
00:34:57,552 --> 00:35:00,345
I think I went a little in my
eye, maybe I'll get a little blind.

371
00:35:00,513 --> 00:35:02,514
I'll have to revise my health plan.

372
00:35:10,606 --> 00:35:13,608
Alright then, Dirky.

373
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:16,945
I can smell my dick in your mouth.

374
00:35:24,836 --> 00:35:26,788
Ask me how a gay man says goodbye.

375
00:35:27,123 --> 00:35:29,249
As a gay man says goodbye?

376
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,251
I'll call you.

377
00:35:41,095 --> 00:35:43,013
-Give me that!
"No!

378
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:45,307
-Let cows.
"I'll tell him.

379
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:47,642
Go fuck you, dick head!

380
00:35:47,894 --> 00:35:54,274
Give me that. I want to use.
I'll burn your ass!

381
00:35:56,736 --> 00:35:59,571
Stupid bitch!

382
00:36:01,157 --> 00:36:03,575
Where was my young man?

383
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:05,911
Rifling through your stuff.

384
00:36:06,245 --> 00:36:07,662
Found something cool?

385
00:36:07,914 --> 00:36:09,915
Nothing worthwhile is stolen.

386
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:14,002
Was playing with the stick-handle, right?

387
00:36:15,796 --> 00:36:17,130
I know where I was.

388
00:36:17,506 --> 00:36:20,258
Do not lie, I can see in his eyes.

389
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,720
She sucked his dick? It was too big?

390
00:36:23,846 --> 00:36:24,596
Bigger than yours.

391
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:26,400
"Bigger than yours"

392
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:29,401
What would you do without dicks?

393
00:36:30,436 --> 00:36:34,481
In a world without poles, you'd starve.

394
00:36:34,982 --> 00:36:38,860
It would be the last man on earth
trying to suck his own dick.

395
00:36:38,944 --> 00:36:42,739
Why are all gone and he's hungry.

396
00:36:46,285 --> 00:36:48,536
What are you doing?

397
00:36:48,788 --> 00:36:50,372
I'm wearing.

398
00:36:50,581 --> 00:36:51,331
Why?

399
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:53,541
Because it is the only way to put clothes.

400
00:36:53,793 --> 00:36:56,961
No. It's more beautiful when naked.

401
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,630
Gotta go.

402
00:36:58,798 --> 00:37:00,465
But just in.

403
00:37:00,716 --> 00:37:01,966
I have school tomorrow, remember?

404
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,786
What? School to suck cocks?
You can practice here!

405
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:06,596
Oh, right.

406
00:37:07,682 --> 00:37:09,099
The small eddy can not be late.

407
00:37:09,183 --> 00:37:13,520
Wake up early, at seven o'clock.
Anal consolation 101.

408
00:37:13,604 --> 00:37:16,189
Yes, enroll there bitch.

409
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:18,108
Do not go.

410
00:37:18,359 --> 00:37:19,609
Gotta go.

411
00:37:19,902 --> 00:37:22,153
- But do not go.
"But I gotta go.

412
00:37:23,406 --> 00:37:25,740
But no...

413
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:31,621
Well, go, bye!

414
00:37:33,165 --> 00:37:34,082
Hey!

415
00:37:38,587 --> 00:37:39,671
Give me a hug.

416
00:37:40,172 --> 00:37:44,217
Fuck you, Hippie.

417
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,111
- Nice fucking.
- Eddy.

418
00:38:05,364 --> 00:38:08,450
- Pants-colada.
- You can call me Gary.

419
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:10,952
As well, Gary?

420
00:38:11,537 --> 00:38:13,538
-Gary.
-Bye.

421
00:38:14,874 --> 00:38:16,416
See you soon, Dirky!

422
00:38:16,625 --> 00:38:18,585
<i>I'll call you!</i>

423
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,712
Prepared.

424
00:38:24,049 --> 00:38:25,466
Go to bed, dude.

425
00:38:25,467 --> 00:38:27,260
Do not tell me what to do.

426
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,605
Do not know who he was.

427
00:40:38,308 --> 00:40:40,309
Honey, I'll be back.

428
00:40:40,811 --> 00:40:42,061
Where'd you go?

429
00:40:42,229 --> 00:40:45,231
I forgot something in the car. Be right back.

430
00:40:46,358 --> 00:40:48,276
Okay, back soon.

431
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:53,614
Can I do anything for you?
- Oh. hey... hi.

432
00:40:53,866 --> 00:40:56,701
Sorry... I know you?

433
00:40:57,035 --> 00:40:59,036
Seriously.

434
00:40:59,288 --> 00:41:01,205
Do not you know?

435
00:41:01,707 --> 00:41:03,666
I dunno, man, you know?

436
00:41:05,669 --> 00:41:06,752
I think...

437
00:41:08,255 --> 00:41:09,839
Can judar so...

438
00:41:11,425 --> 00:41:12,508
What is your name?

439
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,428
Max

440
00:41:15,596 --> 00:41:18,431
Max? Right.

441
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,352
I thought I was...

442
00:41:26,273 --> 00:41:29,609
You are now in this building? Moved?

443
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,861
No. I was visiting some friends.

444
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:33,863
I can not find the way out.

445
00:41:33,947 --> 00:41:35,364
It's a fucking maze.

446
00:41:35,616 --> 00:41:41,700
Yes You know, the first time I went here
found equal to the Hotel Radiance, a maze.

447
00:41:44,641 --> 00:41:46,876
I'm David.

448
00:41:56,553 --> 00:41:58,471
Want something?

449
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:00,473
No, I just...

450
00:42:00,724 --> 00:42:02,808
Sorry if I scared you earlier.

451
00:42:03,143 --> 00:42:07,480
Do not scare me.
"You really...

452
00:42:07,814 --> 00:42:10,399
I am like your friend.

453
00:42:10,651 --> 00:42:15,488
Not a friend. Just... a guy.

454
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:20,493
How crazy, huh?
On the way we find...

455
00:42:23,595 --> 00:42:24,580
Need help getting out?

456
00:42:24,665 --> 00:42:26,332
Can I display output. It's easy.

457
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:30,336
It is not difficult. It is this direction.

458
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,551
What is this?

459
00:43:19,302 --> 00:43:20,720
The laundry?

460
00:43:21,054 --> 00:43:23,222
Man, this is the basement.

461
00:43:25,767 --> 00:43:27,727
Where is the exit?

462
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:31,230
Look man...

463
00:43:31,565 --> 00:43:33,524
It's there. It's there.

464
00:43:33,525 --> 00:43:34,608
I just...

465
00:43:36,945 --> 00:43:38,279
I just want...

466
00:43:39,364 --> 00:43:40,656
Just want to ask you something, okay?

467
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:44,410
Ok

468
00:43:49,916 --> 00:43:51,375
Go, question!

469
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,085
Look, I'm not gay, right?

470
00:43:53,336 --> 00:43:54,044
Right.

471
00:43:54,212 --> 00:43:57,798
I mean.... I have a wife and a girl.

472
00:43:58,049 --> 00:43:59,550
It is magnificent.

473
00:44:01,052 --> 00:44:05,389
But you... know, you...

474
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:10,060
You're not... I mean...
It's not like... As...

475
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:10,811
Like what?

476
00:44:11,062 --> 00:44:12,104
As these boys!

477
00:44:12,189 --> 00:44:14,940
These fags background
corridor. I hate those guys!

478
00:44:15,108 --> 00:44:16,233
They make me sick.

479
00:44:17,903 --> 00:44:20,488
But you and me.

480
00:44:23,575 --> 00:44:25,242
We are two men.

481
00:44:30,081 --> 00:44:31,415
What?

482
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:33,542
I want to suck.

483
00:44:34,169 --> 00:44:37,379
Oh man...
I knew you were a fucking fag.

484
00:44:37,547 --> 00:44:39,548
I told you, I'm not queer!

485
00:44:40,675 --> 00:44:43,219
Sure, it's not queer.

486
00:44:48,433 --> 00:44:50,309
Where do you want...

487
00:44:52,312 --> 00:44:53,312
Here?

488
00:44:56,066 --> 00:44:57,650
I dunno, man.

489
00:44:57,651 --> 00:45:02,363
We can hear if someone comes.
We listen.

490
00:45:03,907 --> 00:45:09,161
And I can pay you!
$ 40! $ 45.

491
00:45:10,664 --> 00:45:11,830
And you just want to suck?

492
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:14,833
Why not let me fags
eat or kiss me.

493
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:19,004
I know, I know, okay... okay.

494
00:45:36,106 --> 00:45:37,898
Come here.

495
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:23,152
Slower.

496
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:45,799
Stay back.

497
00:46:45,842 --> 00:46:47,634
I said do not let me eat.

498
00:46:47,927 --> 00:46:50,512
I want to suck your ass.

499
00:46:50,764 --> 00:46:52,723
Stay back.

500
00:47:06,613 --> 00:47:08,530
You like it?

501
00:47:09,282 --> 00:47:11,283
I love it.

502
00:47:40,313 --> 00:47:42,356
Dude, you really like ass.

503
00:47:43,942 --> 00:47:46,151
Never did it but...

504
00:47:51,908 --> 00:47:53,408
Dude...

505
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:04,461
Hey!

506
00:48:08,466 --> 00:48:10,467
Back off, marginal!

507
00:48:20,186 --> 00:48:21,603
Here we are.

508
00:48:22,021 --> 00:48:23,605
Welcome to the apartment of the central cover.

509
00:48:24,691 --> 00:48:26,108
Sit down.

510
00:48:31,864 --> 00:48:35,033
Okay, let me see how it is.

511
00:48:38,871 --> 00:48:40,289
Hold that.

512
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,917
You press a little. Be right back.

513
00:48:49,841 --> 00:48:52,509
You must be a night owl, right?

514
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,928
Never sleep. Sleep is for young people.

515
00:48:55,763 --> 00:48:56,888
Not like to sleep?

516
00:48:57,223 --> 00:49:00,976
I love it. Sleeping and perchance to dream.

517
00:49:01,894 --> 00:49:04,062
So I go to the laundry.

518
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,356
Laundry and books.

519
00:49:06,941 --> 00:49:08,442
There is medicine for it.

520
00:49:08,693 --> 00:49:10,027
Why? To the laundry?

521
00:49:10,278 --> 00:49:12,070
To sleep.

522
00:49:14,407 --> 00:49:16,658
Is there a remedy for everything.

523
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:18,994
Let me see.

524
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:21,913
Well, the bleeding stopped.

525
00:49:21,914 --> 00:49:22,748
Yes, I think so.

526
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:23,832
Broke?

527
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:25,500
No, it's over.

528
00:49:25,752 --> 00:49:26,251
Good

529
00:49:26,419 --> 00:49:30,422
Sad to see this magnificent face hurt.

530
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,888
Time will tell. Believe me.

531
00:49:33,985 --> 00:49:36,678
Let me take this.

532
00:49:38,181 --> 00:49:41,641
They say that we face we deserve
when we get to forty years.

533
00:49:41,893 --> 00:49:44,061
That is true. It's what they say?

534
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:47,439
Well, I stopped worrying long ago.

535
00:49:48,441 --> 00:49:49,900
Let's see.

536
00:49:50,985 --> 00:49:52,360
I think it will survive.

537
00:49:53,738 --> 00:49:55,322
Boy, he'll hurt yourself.

538
00:49:55,323 --> 00:49:58,158
No. I gave everything he wanted.

539
00:49:58,409 --> 00:49:59,993
-Did you?
-Yes.

540
00:50:00,078 --> 00:50:01,861
If it had not appeared,
would have given him a lesson.

541
00:50:01,913 --> 00:50:04,164
Sorry to interrupt.

542
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:06,333
It was nothing.

543
00:50:06,584 --> 00:50:09,586
And as you call it, finding my basement?

544
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:12,923
-Jeff.
-Jeff. Nice to meet you, Jeff.

545
00:50:13,091 --> 00:50:15,342
"I am Sam.
-Nice to meet you.

546
00:50:16,010 --> 00:50:17,427
There it is.

547
00:50:18,429 --> 00:50:19,429
As new.

548
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:22,933
Ok, put it.

549
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:26,812
This rapid floods.

550
00:50:30,608 --> 00:50:33,777
I thought the flat coverage
could escape the noise.

551
00:50:33,861 --> 00:50:35,695
Flat roof.

552
00:50:35,863 --> 00:50:40,200
Controlled rent. No noises.
But not counted in the rain.

553
00:50:40,201 --> 00:50:43,495
Water everywhere. But not a drop to drink.

554
00:50:44,580 --> 00:50:46,414
I would like to have a jungle here.

555
00:50:46,457 --> 00:50:51,962
A jungle full of plants
to absorb the water.

556
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:55,423
Do you know where to put.

557
00:51:07,854 --> 00:51:09,771
Moment of medicine.

558
00:51:18,781 --> 00:51:20,699
Here you are.

559
00:51:21,993 --> 00:51:23,201
Thanks.

560
00:51:23,369 --> 00:51:24,202
No thanks.

561
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:26,580
No, seriously, thanks.

562
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:30,000
A drink to medicine.

563
00:51:38,551 --> 00:51:39,884
So...

564
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:44,931
What did that guy down there?

565
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,892
Guess it was not to wash clothes.

566
00:51:48,311 --> 00:51:54,024
Dude... is a long history.

567
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:58,695
Okay.

568
00:52:00,448 --> 00:52:02,032
Well, let me see.

569
00:52:02,742 --> 00:52:06,786
First he had tried to leave
building for an hour.

570
00:52:06,871 --> 00:52:08,121
Trying to leave the building.

571
00:52:08,372 --> 00:52:10,623
Yes, I could not leave this place.

572
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:13,293
It's an apartment building. It is not purgatory.

573
00:52:13,544 --> 00:52:15,378
I know, but...

574
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:18,715
Was lost or .. I ended up perdento same.

575
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:21,051
It's like a puzzle, like a maze.

576
00:52:21,302 --> 00:52:24,262
Well, it's a maze or a puzzle?

577
00:52:25,222 --> 00:52:26,473
What is the difference?

578
00:52:28,267 --> 00:52:32,395
A puzzle has pitfalls.
A labyrinth going somewhere.

579
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,440
Let me ask you something.

580
00:52:35,941 --> 00:52:38,443
All men are gay this building?

581
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:41,196
I mean, there's something in the water or what?

582
00:52:42,031 --> 00:52:43,323
I do not know.

583
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:49,412
I'm sure there are some
straight walking around.

584
00:52:49,914 --> 00:52:54,626
But... this building is the gayest
Street and gayest city.

585
00:52:55,294 --> 00:52:56,378
Is it a problem?

586
00:52:58,130 --> 00:52:58,963
No.

587
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:02,258
Are you gay?

588
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:04,260
As the pink paint.

589
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:06,763
So...

590
00:53:08,432 --> 00:53:09,516
Was in the hallway

591
00:53:10,518 --> 00:53:12,310
and this guy said I could
show me the output.

592
00:53:12,311 --> 00:53:13,600
So...

593
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:15,570
what happened?

594
00:53:15,648 --> 00:53:18,900
He took me down there in the basement, e. ..

595
00:53:19,902 --> 00:53:20,985
Yes ..

596
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:25,990
The first thing I did was
tell me that he was gay.

597
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:27,492
I see.

598
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,328
And then said he wanted
suck my dick.

599
00:53:30,579 --> 00:53:31,830
And the guy who hit you?

600
00:53:32,081 --> 00:53:35,800
He did not hit me. Just punched me.

601
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:39,087
Gave a strong and unexpected blow.

602
00:53:39,171 --> 00:53:40,672
Really?

603
00:53:41,006 --> 00:53:42,048
I'm telling you...

604
00:53:44,283 --> 00:53:47,137
He had a look in the eyes of...

605
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,142
as if he wanted to kill me.

606
00:53:53,185 --> 00:53:56,521
Maybe there is a problem with that. Poor guy.

607
00:53:57,022 --> 00:53:58,606
I'll be fine.

608
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:00,400
You do not... he!

609
00:54:02,903 --> 00:54:05,530
He is the bastard? Look at my face!

610
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:09,033
You were just lost.
He is who is caught.

611
00:54:09,118 --> 00:54:11,035
How is he caught?

612
00:54:15,374 --> 00:54:18,543
What do you mean?
Because he thinks that is not a man?

613
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:25,758
Because he craves a dick
and live a lie? Is that it?

614
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:30,346
Because it is not easy for him? Right?

615
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:35,685
I mean, nobody can know who are you?

616
00:54:51,035 --> 00:54:52,744
And you, sir?

617
00:54:54,913 --> 00:54:56,164
What?

618
00:54:56,248 --> 00:54:58,166
If someone asks "Who are you?"

619
00:55:01,629 --> 00:55:03,296
I'm only one guy.

620
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:05,089
Just a guy.

621
00:55:09,303 --> 00:55:11,262
How do you even see?

622
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:15,475
I mean, as a man?

623
00:55:17,102 --> 00:55:19,354
I mean, how gay?

624
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:22,940
I do not know.

625
00:55:23,942 --> 00:55:26,194
I think, I mean... suck cocks.

626
00:55:26,278 --> 00:55:28,321
Well, it's a good start.

627
00:55:28,322 --> 00:55:31,324
Yes, and not ashamed of it.

628
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:32,825
Good for you.

629
00:55:33,077 --> 00:55:35,244
I like to have sex with other guys.

630
00:55:36,497 --> 00:55:40,124
I like to involve them, and fuck.

631
00:55:41,293 --> 00:55:42,877
What kind of guys?

632
00:55:43,379 --> 00:55:45,129
Any kind.

633
00:55:47,633 --> 00:55:50,385
But I do not... I'm not gay.

634
00:55:50,469 --> 00:55:53,888
You know, I mean, I am.

635
00:55:54,139 --> 00:55:56,974
But do not go to gay parades.

636
00:55:57,643 --> 00:55:59,477
Do not live in the light of the rainbow.

637
00:55:59,478 --> 00:56:01,312
Do not want to get married.

638
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:03,981
So you are not politicized.

639
00:56:04,358 --> 00:56:05,858
Yes

640
00:56:06,443 --> 00:56:10,488
But the act of loving a man
is in itself a political statement

641
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:11,697
huh?

642
00:56:12,032 --> 00:56:13,950
Never fell in love with a guy.

643
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:16,452
Do not crush on a guy, yet.

644
00:56:17,955 --> 00:56:20,790
Right. There I fell in love with a guy, yet.

645
00:56:21,375 --> 00:56:23,376
And since I had sex with girls.

646
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,962
Oh, you did it? And me too!

647
00:56:27,297 --> 00:56:29,257
But you said you're gay.

648
00:56:35,305 --> 00:56:37,098
You know what? Fuck gay.

649
00:56:37,349 --> 00:56:38,850
Yes, fuck the gay.

650
00:56:39,184 --> 00:56:41,018
Fuck. Do not believe it.

651
00:56:41,353 --> 00:56:42,937
But believe in you.

652
00:56:44,398 --> 00:56:47,608
You know, guys like me have fought on the frontline.

653
00:56:47,693 --> 00:56:52,530
Guys like you have allowed your
the luxury of being show.

654
00:56:54,032 --> 00:56:56,367
Already took a punch.

655
00:56:56,702 --> 00:56:59,704
Yes, I was punched.

656
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,750
So you're not gay.

657
00:57:05,919 --> 00:57:10,131
Maybe you're just... weird.

658
00:57:10,382 --> 00:57:12,133
Maybe.

659
00:57:12,384 --> 00:57:16,345
Or maybe it's just a traveler
visiting places of interest.

660
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:17,597
Maybe.

661
00:57:17,848 --> 00:57:19,682
A nomad explorer.

662
00:57:19,933 --> 00:57:21,851
Maybe it's just a frat boy.

663
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:25,354
Maybe you're just a tourist.

664
00:57:26,398 --> 00:57:28,399
Maybe I'm just a hustler.

665
00:57:29,401 --> 00:57:31,402
Maybe?

666
00:57:35,532 --> 00:57:38,951
When you say... hustler...

667
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,379
Oh God!

668
00:58:07,356 --> 00:58:09,757
Old man, you really like to fuck.

669
00:58:10,442 --> 00:58:14,528
You have no idea how...

670
00:58:17,449 --> 00:58:19,784
From when I needed.

671
00:58:19,951 --> 00:58:21,619
Our mother!

672
00:58:23,121 --> 00:58:25,373
Hey, do not... not so.

673
00:58:25,874 --> 00:58:27,416
Ok, so.

674
00:59:27,561 --> 00:59:28,727
Here you are.

675
00:59:39,531 --> 00:59:43,951
Our mother! That tail tastier.

676
00:59:46,705 --> 00:59:50,082
Made this old man very happy, my son.

677
00:59:51,501 --> 00:59:53,502
Older men fuck better.

678
00:59:54,337 --> 00:59:55,504
Is this true?

679
00:59:55,755 --> 00:59:56,422
Yes

680
00:59:56,673 --> 00:59:58,090
Why?

681
00:59:58,341 --> 00:59:59,758
I do not know.

682
01:00:00,093 --> 01:00:02,928
They care about what you feel.

683
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,431
Young people just...

684
01:00:08,476 --> 01:00:11,020
Well, it's cool to say that.

685
01:00:11,938 --> 01:00:15,858
I think they would be equal
if you had more years.

686
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,653
I still prefer older men ..

687
01:00:22,616 --> 01:00:26,243
Some of the men who had sex with
become a customer?

688
01:00:26,578 --> 01:00:27,661
No.

689
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:30,623
What a shame.

690
01:00:32,709 --> 01:00:34,710
I wonder why.

691
01:00:34,711 --> 01:00:36,962
I like everything new.

692
01:00:37,297 --> 01:00:40,966
Ah yes... again.

693
01:00:42,886 --> 01:00:45,721
Nothing is new in the world, kid.

694
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:50,059
So it's new to me.

695
01:00:50,644 --> 01:00:55,606
What will you do when you have
known all the men?

696
01:00:56,224 --> 01:00:58,600
When you have fucked with all the city's gay?

697
01:00:58,601 --> 01:00:59,601
This.

698
01:01:00,028 --> 01:01:01,278
I was speechless.

699
01:01:02,530 --> 01:01:04,531
The hero of migration.

700
01:01:04,783 --> 01:01:08,535
That's it. I'll take me where my body.

701
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:09,954
I like that.

702
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:15,125
I like the way you think, so,
wandering somewhere.

703
01:01:15,293 --> 01:01:16,961
Bringing joy to the world.

704
01:01:17,921 --> 01:01:19,338
For a price.

705
01:01:19,589 --> 01:01:24,343
Right. We can not give pleasure to
ourselves, is not it?

706
01:01:24,511 --> 01:01:26,762
No one is selfless.

707
01:01:27,138 --> 01:01:29,056
A man always needs to eat more.

708
01:01:29,307 --> 01:01:30,307
Whatever.

709
01:01:30,642 --> 01:01:31,433
Pay rent.

710
01:01:31,643 --> 01:01:33,519
Oh yes, rent.

711
01:01:34,145 --> 01:01:37,606
And go to school, perhaps?

712
01:01:46,449 --> 01:01:48,450
Possibly.

713
01:01:52,163 --> 01:01:53,664
What?

714
01:02:10,682 --> 01:02:13,016
That's beautiful.

715
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:17,938
Handsome boy.

716
01:02:27,741 --> 01:02:29,700
-Sam?
"Yeah?

717
01:02:31,661 --> 01:02:33,662
How old are you?

718
01:02:34,831 --> 01:02:39,126
I am old as the sun. And you?

719
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:46,175
See them there?

720
01:02:48,136 --> 01:02:50,053
Flowers?

721
01:02:50,805 --> 01:02:52,723
Yes, I see.

722
01:02:53,558 --> 01:02:55,517
Are my age.

723
01:02:56,352 --> 01:03:00,189
No. .. No, son.

724
01:03:01,691 --> 01:03:04,610
You're older than them.

725
01:03:04,694 --> 01:03:07,196
Your body may be young, but...

726
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:12,910
Ali. See that picture?

727
01:03:18,124 --> 01:03:19,875
It's the age you are.

728
01:06:26,896 --> 01:06:28,897
Shit!

729
01:06:31,692 --> 01:06:33,610
Hello!

730
01:06:34,028 --> 01:06:35,987
Still here?

731
01:06:37,114 --> 01:06:38,073
Yes

732
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:43,328
I think this place does not want me to go.

733
01:06:44,539 --> 01:06:48,833
I forgot. You're the dick-Grab
or pants-colada?

734
01:06:49,001 --> 01:06:51,169
Only Gary, ok?

735
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,338
Legal.

736
01:07:03,432 --> 01:07:05,308
Anything I can do?

737
01:07:12,566 --> 01:07:14,567
Wait, wait.

738
01:07:17,655 --> 01:07:18,405
Speech.

739
01:07:18,698 --> 01:07:20,573
Refers to that?

740
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:23,743
Absolutely.

741
01:07:42,096 --> 01:07:44,097
Sit.

742
01:07:45,057 --> 01:07:47,058
Accepts a wine?

743
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:48,893
Wine, cool.

744
01:07:55,735 --> 01:07:57,902
Health
Health

745
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:05,378
So...

746
01:08:05,879 --> 01:08:07,670
I put a song?

747
01:08:07,713 --> 01:08:09,000
Sure.
-Yes?

748
01:08:09,021 --> 01:08:12,042
I have a good repertoire.

749
01:08:24,847 --> 01:08:26,806
It's right here?

750
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:33,563
When he entered the house
Leon I was crazy.

751
01:08:35,399 --> 01:08:37,901
You know, those things you feel in your stomach,

752
01:08:39,570 --> 01:08:45,283
he never knew, but it's like
if you knew long ago.

753
01:08:48,037 --> 01:08:49,996
It's a crazy dream.

754
01:08:52,917 --> 01:08:56,002
But I swear... I dreamed about you.

755
01:08:56,253 --> 01:08:58,087
Us sonhecemos two hours ago.
"I know.

756
01:08:58,214 --> 01:08:59,380
That's the crazy part...

757
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:04,052
Or creepy.
But you're not creepy.

758
01:09:04,136 --> 01:09:07,972
This is... cool.
What time is it?

759
01:09:08,224 --> 01:09:10,058
I do not know. I think it's too late.

760
01:09:12,561 --> 01:09:14,896
I'll never get to sleep

761
01:09:15,147 --> 01:09:17,065
Want to go?

762
01:09:30,621 --> 01:09:33,331
"Are you nervous?
"My God, I am!

763
01:09:33,582 --> 01:09:34,832
It's okay.

764
01:09:36,919 --> 01:09:39,254
-I leave you nervous?
-Yes.

765
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:40,880
Why?

766
01:09:41,173 --> 01:09:44,175
I guess because you're beautiful.

767
01:09:44,426 --> 01:09:46,344
For me, I mean.

768
01:09:49,181 --> 01:09:51,099
Thanks.

769
01:09:54,853 --> 01:09:56,813
Can I ask you a question?

770
01:09:57,481 --> 01:09:59,440
Sure.

771
01:10:00,693 --> 01:10:02,652
You really hustler?

772
01:10:03,404 --> 01:10:04,946
Yes

773
01:10:05,781 --> 01:10:10,159
You. .. lay with Jacob?

774
01:10:10,911 --> 01:10:12,495
I do not know. Who is Jacob?

775
01:10:12,746 --> 01:10:15,164
Dirky. Leon calls him Dirky.

776
01:10:17,501 --> 01:10:18,876
Ah yes.

777
01:10:21,589 --> 01:10:23,172
I lay with him.

778
01:10:27,386 --> 01:10:28,469
I take it?

779
01:10:28,721 --> 01:10:31,180
Yes, please excuse me.

780
01:10:39,898 --> 01:10:41,065
Thanks.

781
01:10:41,275 --> 01:10:44,861
I have a little money.

782
01:10:46,363 --> 01:10:47,405
Legal.

783
01:10:47,823 --> 01:10:49,699
I think you want...

784
01:10:50,868 --> 01:10:52,368
Sure.

785
01:10:52,995 --> 01:10:54,412
Ok

786
01:11:55,390 --> 01:11:56,570
So...

787
01:11:57,500 --> 01:11:59,143
How much?

788
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:02,396
Depends.

789
01:12:02,898 --> 01:12:04,482
What is thought?

790
01:12:04,733 --> 01:12:06,651
I. ..

791
01:12:11,782 --> 01:12:13,783
Really want to kiss you.

792
01:12:14,284 --> 01:12:16,244
Speak again.

793
01:12:16,495 --> 01:12:18,412
I just want to kiss you.

794
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,542
You are kidding, right?

795
01:12:23,293 --> 01:12:25,211
No.

796
01:12:25,462 --> 01:12:29,507
Sorry... I do not kiss.

797
01:12:30,342 --> 01:12:32,510
Why?

798
01:12:32,761 --> 01:12:38,057
I do not know. It is very... so...
It's so...

799
01:12:38,308 --> 01:12:39,684
Intimate?

800
01:12:39,852 --> 01:12:41,769
This.

801
01:12:42,020 --> 01:12:43,938
It is very real.

802
01:12:44,940 --> 01:12:45,648
Yes

803
01:12:52,739 --> 01:12:54,323
$ 100 to kiss me.

804
01:12:55,492 --> 01:12:58,661
I am a great kisser.
I swear, I swear I am.

805
01:12:58,912 --> 01:13:00,913
I'm sure you are!

806
01:13:01,832 --> 01:13:05,209
But... you're very beautiful.

807
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:07,003
Should find someone who...

808
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,839
But I want to kiss you.

809
01:13:12,884 --> 01:13:16,345
150? 160?

810
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,014
Dude!

811
01:13:18,181 --> 01:13:19,724
Should be more than
got all night.

812
01:13:19,891 --> 01:13:21,892
You have no idea how much
finally made tonight.

813
01:13:24,187 --> 01:13:26,022
"Why?
-Why what?

814
01:13:27,816 --> 01:13:30,151
Why me? And why now?

815
01:13:31,111 --> 01:13:33,195
And do not tell me that's why dream of me.

816
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:34,897
You were right, it's horrifying.

817
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,908
I mean, we can not just fucking?

818
01:13:37,909 --> 01:13:40,077
No, I do not want.... Do not want to fuck.

819
01:13:40,078 --> 01:13:41,078
I want to...

820
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:44,081
I want to kiss you.

821
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:48,794
I want to kiss you. I want to kiss you deeply.

822
01:13:49,212 --> 01:13:51,297
Per day.

823
01:13:54,468 --> 01:13:56,052
Why?

824
01:13:56,303 --> 01:14:00,348
Because if you kiss me, I will not be alone.

825
01:14:01,933 --> 01:14:06,228
You know? Alone, alone.

826
01:14:07,397 --> 01:14:10,441
Five minutes of shit.

827
01:14:13,195 --> 01:14:18,199
Then when you go, when...

828
01:14:19,034 --> 01:14:20,159
Can I have...

829
01:14:22,412 --> 01:14:25,581
Can I have every kiss,
I remember every kiss.

830
01:14:26,917 --> 01:14:28,793
Because the kiss will be mine.

831
01:14:33,924 --> 01:14:36,092
Because it will touch my soul.

832
01:14:39,429 --> 01:14:42,973
That's where I really need to be touched now.

833
01:14:43,141 --> 01:14:45,101
Not on my stick, or in my hole...

834
01:14:47,729 --> 01:14:51,357
Here, here, is here in this hole.

835
01:14:52,109 --> 01:14:53,859
And I'll pay for it.

836
01:14:54,444 --> 01:14:58,614
I'll be happy paying for it.

837
01:14:58,907 --> 01:15:00,908
Are the economics of your life?

838
01:15:01,201 --> 01:15:04,120
Toma. 200, $ 200.

839
01:15:06,081 --> 01:15:08,124
All you need do is kiss me.

840
01:15:10,627 --> 01:15:14,296
What happens is I "do not touch your soul"?

841
01:15:15,298 --> 01:15:17,842
You can laugh if you want.

842
01:15:18,051 --> 01:15:19,802
I'm not laughing at you.

843
01:15:21,388 --> 01:15:25,891
Dude, if I can not?

844
01:15:28,645 --> 01:15:30,813
It's a risk I take.

845
01:15:36,862 --> 01:15:38,500
Ok

846
01:15:39,601 --> 01:15:41,601
So let's kiss the soul.

847
01:15:42,242 --> 01:15:43,117
Really?

848
01:15:43,368 --> 01:15:46,871
Seriously. Give me that fucking money.

849
01:15:53,478 --> 01:15:57,047
Okay. How do you want?

850
01:15:57,299 --> 01:15:59,466
Here.

851
01:15:59,718 --> 01:16:01,135
Here?

852
01:16:01,386 --> 01:16:03,304
Yes

853
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,571
So?

854
01:16:21,573 --> 01:16:23,532
No.

855
01:16:59,569 --> 01:17:01,528
What?

856
01:17:01,738 --> 01:17:03,572
It is a good kisser.

857
01:17:05,575 --> 01:17:07,493
Come here.

858
01:17:46,032 --> 01:17:49,243
What? What?

859
01:17:50,495 --> 01:17:53,080
Nobody ever kissed me like that before.

860
01:17:55,458 --> 01:17:57,418
Are you okay?

861
01:17:57,585 --> 01:17:59,837
Yes, yes, that is...

862
01:18:00,088 --> 01:18:01,922
What?

863
01:18:02,757 --> 01:18:04,716
Nothing.

864
01:18:38,459 --> 01:18:39,459
Feeling?

865
01:18:43,631 --> 01:18:45,549
I'm feeling, I'm feeling.

866
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:47,467
Kiss me.

867
01:20:12,803 --> 01:20:13,720
Shit!

868
01:20:24,148 --> 01:20:27,859
Shit!

869
01:20:28,236 --> 01:20:29,903
Do not believe I actually enjoyed that.

870
01:20:30,154 --> 01:20:33,448
Me too, me too.

871
01:20:53,469 --> 01:20:55,512
Are you sleeping?

872
01:20:55,763 --> 01:20:58,432
No. I'm awake.

873
01:21:02,603 --> 01:21:05,355
I can hear your heart.

874
01:21:06,274 --> 01:21:10,152
I love to look like, but my
leg is numb.

875
01:21:11,904 --> 01:21:14,906
Sorry.

876
01:21:21,970 --> 01:21:23,456
What dizzy!

877
01:21:58,618 --> 01:22:01,411
Hey, get there.

878
01:22:02,205 --> 01:22:04,206
Thanks.

879
01:22:07,877 --> 01:22:09,878
Hey, here, here.

880
01:22:14,508 --> 01:22:16,051
Basket.

881
01:22:16,385 --> 01:22:18,345
Guards later.

882
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:25,101
It's what you wanted?

883
01:22:27,730 --> 01:22:31,191
Yes, that was it.

884
01:22:35,237 --> 01:22:37,072
I feel it all over again, you know?

885
01:22:48,918 --> 01:22:51,878
What?

886
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:56,800
I raise myself in my current love.

887
01:23:00,930 --> 01:23:05,433
Born of light rain.

888
01:23:09,105 --> 01:23:11,106
Full of you.

889
01:23:14,276 --> 01:23:15,193
And lost.

890
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:24,452
And then the light hits my eyes.

891
01:23:27,373 --> 01:23:31,501
View mirror of my soul.

892
01:23:35,756 --> 01:23:39,092
And come together again.

893
01:23:41,095 --> 01:23:43,096
Wrote it?

894
01:23:43,848 --> 01:23:46,850
No, but... I write.

895
01:24:43,449 --> 01:24:45,408
Who is this?

896
01:24:46,876 --> 01:24:47,994
It's me!

897
01:24:50,331 --> 01:24:52,081
I took my mother's house.

898
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:56,711
It's a memory I do not know.

899
01:25:10,017 --> 01:25:13,728
You gave me inspiration.

900
01:25:23,163 --> 01:25:25,240
You know, you can stay if you want.

901
01:25:25,491 --> 01:25:29,619
No, no. Gotta go.

902
01:25:30,621 --> 01:25:32,872
I have to continue.

903
01:25:54,186 --> 01:25:55,728
Toma.

904
01:25:58,857 --> 01:26:00,858
What is this?

905
01:26:01,110 --> 01:26:04,278
It is a griffin.

906
01:26:05,948 --> 01:26:08,908
It's magic... the sun.

907
01:26:10,911 --> 01:26:12,787
Guard a treasure.

908
01:26:12,871 --> 01:26:13,621
It's good luck!

909
01:26:14,164 --> 01:26:18,042
OK. Thanks.

910
01:26:31,098 --> 01:26:32,348
Sayonara.

911
01:26:35,308 --> 01:26:37,228
How do I leave this place?

912
01:26:39,479 --> 01:26:44,569
Turn right, go down the stairs
to the entrance, and is at the door.

913
01:26:45,112 --> 01:26:46,988
Just like that?

914
01:26:47,448 --> 01:26:49,365
Simple as that.

915
01:26:53,662 --> 01:26:54,829
Legal.

916
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:02,253
-Bye.
-Bye.

917
01:29:38,254 --> 01:29:50,254
From Translation: Lumpy
