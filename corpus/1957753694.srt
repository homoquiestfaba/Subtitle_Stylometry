1
00:00:10,135 --> 00:00:12,762
(eerie music)

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:27,610
(ambient electronic music)
(machine trilling)

3
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,869
(suspenseful music)

4
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:46,296
(suspenseful music)
(lightning striking)

5
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,886
(plane rumbling)
- Oh!

6
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,098
Yeah, ha-ha-ha, yeah!

7
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:58,183
Hey! Ha-ha-ha!

8
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:01,102
Yeah!

9
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,729
Hey!
(plane rumbling)

10
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:07,108
Yeah-ha! (laughs)

11
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,281
(soft orchestral music)

12
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,633
(water burbling)

13
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,812
(water sloshing)

14
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:38,074
Oh, it's so beautiful
out here today.

15
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,618
Yeah, sure is. (chuckles)

16
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,621
- Oh, did you see the ray?
- (chuckles) Yeah, huge.

17
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,290
- Look what I got.
- Whoa, nice.

18
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,670
(chuckles) Hey.

19
00:02:50,754 --> 00:02:51,629
Hey

20
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,882
Look what I scored.

21
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,258
(all laugh)

22
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:58,219
What? How did you do that?

23
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,263
You need to learn
the way of the fish.

24
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,640
Having fun, sis?

25
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,309
- Yeah.
- Group shot.

26
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,313
All right, okay, you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

27
00:03:08,396 --> 00:03:11,066
- Yeah.
- One, two, three, smile.

28
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,237
(shutter clicking)
(soft orchestral music)

29
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,073
That was so much fun.

30
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,574
(both chuckle)

31
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,618
I'm so glad you got
me back into diving.

32
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,119
You're a natural.

33
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,037
Like you?

34
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,622
(waves crashing)

35
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,999
(birds squawking)

36
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,083
Hey, what's that?

37
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,211
- Oh, I don't know.
- How good

38
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,171
are the islands going to be?

39
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,048
I know, right?

40
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:37,258
The tropical water,
all that sunshine,

41
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,510
fish everywhere.
- Mm, yeah.

42
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,303
Can't wait.

43
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:42,389
Greg come around to it yet?

44
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,973
- Not really.
- Come on.

45
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,143
It's just like book club only
with fish and spear guns.

46
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,645
He gets that, doesn't he?

47
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,855
- Sort of.
- Hmm.

48
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,274
He'll come around to
it once he realizes

49
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,193
what it means to you.

50
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,276
Isn't that Greg?

51
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,239
Yeah, it is.

52
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,832
Hey, babe. Ladies.

53
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,418
What are you doing here?

54
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,562
(chuckles) Well, that's
a nice way to greet the guy

55
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,963
who's come to give
you a ride home.

56
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,464
But I said I had a lift.

57
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,260
Okay, well, I
thought it'd be nice

58
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,343
to pick you up myself.

59
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,390
Thank you.

60
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,100
See you, sis.

61
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,688
- See you guys.
- See ya.

62
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,819
(keys jangling)

63
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:46,119
(ambient music)
(indistinct arguing)

64
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:50,290
God, will you get it
through your fucking head?

65
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:54,752
Get in!

66
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,341
(door opens and closes)

67
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,717
(engine starting)

68
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,093
(phone ringing)

69
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,763
(ambient music)

70
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,643
Hey, this is Cath.
Leave a message, bye.

71
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,856
Hey, sis. Uh, hope all's okay.

72
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,442
Um, just give me a ring. Bye.

73
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,410
(upbeat electronic music)

74
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:30,246
(door closes)

75
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,373
Hey.

76
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,458
How was your day?

77
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,626
Hmm?

78
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,878
Have you left the house at all?

79
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,464
Uh, well, I'm an exotic bloom,

80
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:40,840
so I'm not meant to be outside.

81
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:45,095
Oh, okay, well, exotic bloom,

82
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,972
like we agreed, if you're gonna
be staying here for a while,

83
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,158
you need to be
pulling your weight.

84
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,308
You sound like mom.

85
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,646
Well, she has a point.

86
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,314
Look, I'm just
different. Okay?

87
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:57,416
I'm not like you and Cath.

88
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,440
Mm-hmm.

89
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,612
(phone dings)

90
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,117
(ominous music)

91
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,415
Hey, I gotta go, but
I'll be back soon, okay?

92
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,334
(phone ringing)

93
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,924
Hey, this is Cath.
Leave a message, bye.

94
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:25,593
(ominous music)

95
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:55,373
(door creaking)

96
00:06:55,457 --> 00:06:56,166
Hello?

97
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,336
(suspenseful music)

98
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:17,645
Greg?

99
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,277
Greg?

100
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,623
Greg?

101
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,006
She wouldn't listen.

102
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:48,009
(suspenseful music)

103
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:49,427
Where's Cath?

104
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:51,596
Where's my sister?

105
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,224
She made me do it.

106
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,190
(Nic gasps softly)

107
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,273
Cath?

108
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,819
Cath?

109
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:14,994
(Nic breathes uneasily)

110
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,666
Cath?

111
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,550
(water squishing)

112
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:31,803
(Nic breathes uneasily)

113
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,058
(intense music)

114
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,103
(whimpering) Cath!

115
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:45,191
(water rushing and bubbling)
(intense music)

116
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,034
(water burbling)

117
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:08,131
(soft guitar music)
(motorcycle buzzing)

118
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,772
(birds chirping)

119
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:50,924
(mellow electronic music)

120
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,677
(waves crashing)

121
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:59,849
- Hello.
- (gasps) There she is!

122
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:03,520
(chuckles) Aw.
- How are you?

123
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,522
Wow, look at you.

124
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,774
Ah, Jodes, guess who's here?

125
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:12,570
Nic! We we starting to worry.

126
00:10:12,654 --> 00:10:14,280
I didn't know if you
got my last message

127
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,615
about the change of address.

128
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,033
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

129
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,577
It's, uh, hard getting
online in rural India.

130
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,871
India. How was that?

131
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,997
It was good.

132
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,377
Well, I got something.

133
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,546
(bag unzips)

134
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,297
Tequila?
- Ooh-ah!

135
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:32,674
Party time.
(Nic chuckles)

136
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,676
(soft electronic music)

137
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,094
It's so good to see you.

138
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:38,263
Yeah, you too.

139
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,307
It's amazing, isn't it?

140
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:44,852
Yeah, it is.

141
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,694
Yeah, I'll go get the drinks.

142
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,991
(ice cubes clinking)

143
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,868
What do you
think? Is she okay?

144
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,625
At least she's here.

145
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,709
Yeah.

146
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,964
- Ready?
- Ready.

147
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:17,177
(soft electronic music)

148
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,595
Here you go

149
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,678
Oh, thanks.

150
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:22,807
What? Annie.

151
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,979
Oh my God. What
are you doing here?

152
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:30,190
I wanted to surprise you.

153
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:33,485
Huh. Yeah, you've
definitely done that.

154
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,404
So what you're into diving now?

155
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,156
Well, yeah, sort of.

156
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,534
(chuckling)

157
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:42,618
What's that?

158
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:46,247
Oh, that, we wanted
to talk to you about it.

159
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:51,836
You know, coming here
was Cath's dream.

160
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,755
So we thought it'd
be the perfect place

161
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,838
to pay our tributes.

162
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,278
We all thought it
was a good idea,

163
00:11:59,302 --> 00:12:00,696
but if you don't
think it's right then-

164
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,934
No, no, I'm sure
it's great. (chuckles)

165
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,106
Uh, I'm kind of tired
from the long trip.

166
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:12,189
Where's my room?

167
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:18,279
Yeah, I'll show you.

168
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,363
Hmm.

169
00:12:24,369 --> 00:12:26,955
(both sighing)

170
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,500
Here you go.

171
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:31,501
Thanks.

172
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,128
(tense music)
(fan whirring)

173
00:12:33,211 --> 00:12:35,964
(door closes)

174
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,510
(Nic crying)

175
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,968
(Cath screaming)
(water bubbling)

176
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:57,235
(Nic gasping and crying)

177
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,447
(soft dramatic music)

178
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:04,200
(waves crashing)

179
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,715
Can I have the wine after you?

180
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,925
- Yeah.
- Oof, look at you go.

181
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:23,803
- Want some more.
- Yes. (laughs)

182
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:26,806
Why don't we make a toast here?

183
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:33,812
Top up?

184
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,690
Oh, yeah, thank you.

185
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,735
(wine pouring)

186
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,818
Hmm.

187
00:13:42,197 --> 00:13:43,782
What have you been up to?

188
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:44,866
Not much.

189
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:47,660
Um, just working,
looking after mom.

190
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:52,123
I made an apple
pie the other day.

191
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:54,626
What? You're cooking?

192
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:57,003
(chuckles) That's great.

193
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,799
(glasses clink)
(both chuckle)

194
00:14:00,882 --> 00:14:03,885
(waves crashing)

195
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,428
So is it true?

196
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:07,764
You were working in the
Greek Islands on a dive boat?

197
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:09,974
(chuckles) Yeah.

198
00:14:10,058 --> 00:14:12,769
Yeah, taking happy
snaps of rich divers.

199
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:18,942
But, um, yeah, it
didn't really work out.

200
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:23,988
Stopped diving, actually.

201
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,574
Really?

202
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:29,827
Yeah.

203
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,835
Hey, come and help me
cook the marshmallows

204
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,213
'cause I keep dropping
them in the fire. (laughs)

205
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,297
Watch out for that.

206
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:44,968
Clutz.
(Annie chuckles)

207
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:47,053
(soft dramatic music)

208
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:48,555
Here.

209
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,890
(indistinct chattering)

210
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:53,476
(women laughing)

211
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,229
(fire crackling)

212
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,066
(Nic sighs)

213
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:03,319
(soft dramatic music)

214
00:15:18,001 --> 00:15:21,046
Three days of
paddling. Three days?

215
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,380
I thought you said it was two.

216
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,466
It's two nights, but
three days paddling.

217
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:26,426
Two days wouldn't
be worth coming for.

218
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:28,928
Three days of paddling.

219
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,807
Don't worry. We'll
take it easy on you.

220
00:15:32,891 --> 00:15:34,100
Won't we, Jodie?

221
00:15:34,184 --> 00:15:35,184
Of course.

222
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,064
You did say that there was
gonna be a four-star resort.

223
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:43,693
There is, absolute luxury,
rising pool, cocktails.

224
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,612
Everything a girl could want.

225
00:15:45,695 --> 00:15:46,863
That's the third night.

226
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:50,075
The third night? Great.

227
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:51,385
(gentle guitar music)
(waves crashing)

228
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,409
Here we go.

229
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:55,413
- Look at that.
- Oh.

230
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,209
Oh my God.
- Come on, slow pokes.

231
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:02,337
(Annie chuckles)

232
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,758
Let's go.

233
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,930
(sighs) Okay, who wants what?

234
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,266
Actually, Annie,
thinking about it,

235
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,911
maybe you should take
one of the yellow ones.

236
00:16:16,935 --> 00:16:18,520
Easier to get in and out of.

237
00:16:18,603 --> 00:16:19,938
- Sure.
- Lisa,

238
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:21,815
you'll take the
other yellow one.

239
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,568
Okay.

240
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,445
Okay. Let's get packing

241
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:30,073
And remember to distribute
the weight evenly.

242
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,492
Is she always this alpha?

243
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:36,037
Mostly. (chuckles)

244
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,040
(ominous music)

245
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:41,793
(waves crashing)

246
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:48,341
(suit zipping)

247
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:49,467
Okay. Let's go.

248
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:52,053
(bright music)

249
00:17:17,746 --> 00:17:20,457
(water burbling)

250
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:33,970
(water sloshing)

251
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,726
(Annie breathes uneasily)

252
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:09,089
How are you? You okay?

253
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:10,465
Yeah.

254
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,050
You look tired.

255
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:14,052
You wanna take a break?

256
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,304
No, I'm not really tired.
I don't need a break.

257
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:24,229
You know, Annie
don't get me wrong,

258
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:26,231
it's great to see
you, it's just like

259
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:29,317
this isn't really you.

260
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,153
(birds squawking)

261
00:18:32,237 --> 00:18:33,947
You might be surprised.

262
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:37,367
Come on. I'll tow you.

263
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,203
I'm fine. Thanks.

264
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:44,207
(paddle taps)
(water splashes)

265
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,710
(Nic sighs)

266
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:48,753
Hmm.

267
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:52,132
(soft guitar music)
(water burbling)

268
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:56,386
(water sloshing and dripping)

269
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,513
(exhales) Yeah,
this is the place.

270
00:18:58,596 --> 00:19:01,141
Yes. Hey, we're
gonna go for a dive.

271
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,282
Oh. It's so beautiful.

272
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:21,286
(Annie chuckles)

273
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:26,374
(Nic breathes uneasily)
(ominous music)

274
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,340
(Nic exhaling)

275
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:35,967
- Mm.
- Oh.

276
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,051
Hey.

277
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:39,511
Ready?

278
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,016
Uh, I'm just
gonna float up here.

279
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,309
Come with us?

280
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:45,392
Okay.

281
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,190
(ominous music)

282
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:53,109
Let's go over here for a bit.

283
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,987
(water sloshing)

284
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,827
Nic, follow me down?

285
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,329
I'll come down in a minute.

286
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,412
Okay.

287
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:17,092
(soft dramatic music)
(water burbling)

288
00:20:26,309 --> 00:20:29,229
(water sloshing)

289
00:20:35,652 --> 00:20:37,320
(water splashing)

290
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:39,155
(suspenseful music)

291
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:42,033
(Annie breathes uneasily)

292
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,744
(water burbling)

293
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:53,336
(Annie breathes uneasily)

294
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,090
(water sloshing)

295
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:01,636
(Nic breathes heavily)

296
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,028
(Nic inhales)

297
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:20,405
(water burbling)

298
00:21:20,488 --> 00:21:23,867
(water rushing)
(Cath screaming)

299
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,955
(intense music)
(water bubbling)

300
00:21:29,456 --> 00:21:31,624
(Nic gasping)

301
00:21:36,296 --> 00:21:41,301
(water burbling)
(suspenseful music)

302
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:46,765
(water sloshing)
(kayaks thudding)

303
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:55,398
(intense music)

304
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,316
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

305
00:21:56,399 --> 00:21:57,484
Can you help me get out?

306
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,277
Well, yeah, of course.

307
00:21:59,361 --> 00:22:00,362
Okay.

308
00:22:00,445 --> 00:22:02,322
I think I've
damaged my spearhead.

309
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:07,160
(suspenseful music)

310
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,287
Hey, you coming down?

311
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:12,499
Oh, my sinuses are playing up.

312
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,376
Think I'm coming
down with something.

313
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:18,546
Okay. See you soon?

314
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:20,048
Mm. Yeah.

315
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:21,131
Okay.

316
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,344
(water splashes)

317
00:22:24,427 --> 00:22:27,097
(water sloshing)

318
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,028
(chuckles) There's kids
swimming on that island.

319
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,576
Wait, what's that?

320
00:22:51,579 --> 00:22:54,207
Lots of fish around.
Must be a bait ball.

321
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:59,254
(water burbling)
(suspenseful music)

322
00:23:05,343 --> 00:23:08,013
(water sloshing)

323
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:21,567
Shit.

324
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,487
- What?
- I think I saw a shark.

325
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,449
Was it big?

326
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:30,535
I don't know. I, I just
saw the tip of the fan.

327
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:35,623
(suspenseful music)
(water burbling)

328
00:23:42,714 --> 00:23:44,341
(spear gun fires)

329
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:46,968
We should let them know, right?

330
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,178
- Yeah.
- Nic!

331
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,514
Nic, there's a shark!

332
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:56,603
(suspenseful music)
(water burbling)

333
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:00,940
Nic, there's a shark!

334
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,567
Come on! Nic!

335
00:24:06,571 --> 00:24:09,282
Look out! There's a shark!

336
00:24:09,366 --> 00:24:12,327
(gasps) Hi.

337
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,620
Check this out.

338
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,246
[Annie] There's a shark!

339
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,665
(Jodie panting)

340
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:19,834
(suspenseful music)

341
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,587
Nic, come back! I
think I saw a shark!

342
00:24:22,671 --> 00:24:23,671
Come back!

343
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:33,348
(water burbling)

344
00:24:35,684 --> 00:24:38,687
(suspenseful music)

345
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:05,588
(exhales) I can't see anything.

346
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:07,257
- Okay.
- Stay calm.

347
00:25:08,466 --> 00:25:09,634
Don't splash.

348
00:25:09,718 --> 00:25:12,554
(suspenseful music)
(water sloshing)

349
00:25:12,637 --> 00:25:16,057
(Nic breathes uneasily)

350
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:21,730
(water burbling)

351
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,791
I didn't see anything.
(breathes uneasily)

352
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:44,878
(suspenseful music)

353
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,677
(water splashing)

354
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:01,019
You saw a shark?

355
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:02,103
Annie did.

356
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:04,229
How big?

357
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,984
I don't know. I
just saw the tip.

358
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:11,279
It's probably a reefy.
There's lots of 'em around.

359
00:26:11,363 --> 00:26:12,864
Yeah. They're mostly harmless.

360
00:26:14,282 --> 00:26:16,326
So many fish came through.

361
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,620
I know. Look what I scored.

362
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,703
Oh, wow.

363
00:26:22,999 --> 00:26:24,209
It's almost lunch time.

364
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,586
The sooner we get to the
island, sooner we eat.

365
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,422
Nic, why don't
you and I go ahead

366
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:30,924
and start cooking up this fish?

367
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,844
- You sure you're okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

368
00:26:34,928 --> 00:26:37,013
I was just worried

Yeah. I'm fine.

380

Is that the first
time you've met the man

381
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:24,978
in the gray suit?

382
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:26,771
- What?
- The man in the gray suit.

383
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:28,857
That's what surfers call sharks.

384
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,108
- Really?
- Yeah.

385
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,693
I've seen a few.

386

They're pretty timid usually.

387
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,321
It's the big ones you
have to worry about.

00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:29,304
(Jodie grunting)

561
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:31,306
God. (whimpering)

562
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:32,389
Oh my God.

563
00:40:35,810 --> 00:40:37,812
(Jodie breathes heavily)

564
00:40:37,896 --> 00:40:40,565
(water sloshing)

565
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:50,367
(suspenseful music)

566
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,208
(panting) Shark!

567
00:40:58,291 --> 00:40:59,000
Shark!

568
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:00,502
(children laughing)

569
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:02,462
(water splashing)

570
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:03,838
(children chattering)

571
00:41:03,922 --> 00:41:05,340
Shark!

572
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:06,966
(children laughing)
- See ya.

573
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,510
(water splashing)

574
00:41:08,593 --> 00:41:11,596
(suspenseful music)

575
00:41:13,765 --> 00:41:16,601
(Jodie panting)

576
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:22,399
(water sloshing)

577
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:57,475
Shark! Shark!

578
00:41:58,393 --> 00:41:59,393
Mom, shark!

579
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:01,646
(waves crashing)

580
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,735
(boy breathes heavily)
(water sloshing)

581
00:42:08,987 --> 00:42:10,071
Shark! Shark!

582
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:13,575
Shark! Shark!

583
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:17,746
Shark, shark! Winston, hurry up!

584
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:19,247
(water splashing)

585
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:20,415
Faster! Faster!

586
00:42:20,498 --> 00:42:22,375
Winston! Come on, come!

587
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:26,421
(water splashing)

588
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:38,058
(suspenseful music)

589
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:41,603
Stay there, Demi!

590
00:42:41,686 --> 00:42:43,396
Demi, don't move, don't move!

591
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,856
Good girl!

592
00:42:44,939 --> 00:42:47,650
(water sloshing)

593
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:59,829

00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:25,105
(water splashing)
(wood snapping)

596
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:26,564
(Demi screaming)

597
00:43:26,648 --> 00:43:29,317
(water bubbling)

598
00:43:31,361 --> 00:43:34,155
(shark thrashing)

599
00:43:41,162 --> 00:43:43,748
(Jodie breathes heavily)

600
00:43:43,832 --> 00:43:45,709
(water bubbling)

601
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:47,002
(Demi screaming)

602
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,045
(Betty gasps)
- (gasps) Oh my God.

603
00:43:49,129 --> 00:43:50,338
(water splashing)

604
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:53,008
(Demi gasping)

605
00:43:56,261 --> 00:43:57,387
Yeah. Good girl.

606
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,722
Come on, come on, come on.

607
00:43:58,805 --> 00:44:02,767
(suspenseful music)
(water sloshing)

608
00:44:02,851 --> 00:44:06,354
(Demi breathes heavily)

609
00:44:07,647 --> 00:44:09,858
Move, move faster, faster!

610
00:44:10,942 --> 00:44:14,362
(Demi breathes heavily)

611
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,203
Come on, here, gir

612
00:44:24,456 --> 00:44:27,584
Here. (gasping)

613
00:44:27,667 --> 00:44:29,002
(intense music)

614
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:31,546
(Demi screaming)

615
00:44:31,629 --> 00:44:33,631
(water rushing)

616
00:44:33,715 --> 00:44:38,428
(Demi screaming)
(Betty gasping)

617
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:41,514
(screaming) Oh God!

618
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:45,310
(Jodie breathes heavily)

619
00:44:45,393 --> 00:44:47,854
(Demi gasping)

620
00:44:52,650 --> 00:44:54,319
Come on! I got ya!

621
00:44:54,402 --> 00:44:56,780
(Demi groaning)

622
00:44:56,863 --> 00:44:59,449
(Jodie panting)

623
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:02,369
(Demi sobbing)

624
00:45:02,452 --> 00:45:03,870
Oh, okay!

625
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:06,247
My, my leg! (sobbing)

626
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:08,458
You're okay. You're
all right, baby.

627
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,960
(Demi sobbing)
You're okay.

628
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:13,838
(water splashing)

629
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:24,099
Are you okay? Hey?

630
00:45:24,182 --> 00:45:25,767
(Demi sobbing)

631
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:29,020
(indistinct chattering)

632
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:32,190
Lisa's gone. She's gone.

633
00:45:32,273 --> 00:45:34,109
Come here. It's okay.

634
00:45:34,192 --> 00:45:36,027
(Jodie sobbing)
It's okay.

635
00:45:36,111 --> 00:45:39,531
(Nic breathes uneasily)

636
00:45:40,448 --> 00:45:42,409
Okay. All right, come on.

637
00:45:42,492 --> 00:45:44,703
Hey. It's gone, right?

638
00:45:44,786 --> 00:45:46,788
Come on. Let's go, okay?

639
00:45:47,914 --> 00:45:48,914
(Demi sobbing)

640
00:45:48,957 --> 00:45:50,041
Demi! Demi!

641
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:54,629
Here, here! I got her!

642
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,798
Get her up here! Come on!

643
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:58,967
Get the towels! Quick, quick!

644
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,385
Oh gosh.

645
00:46:00,468 --> 00:46:02,470
Give them to me. Okay, okay.

646
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,723
We have to put pressure on it.

647
00:46:04,806 --> 00:46:07,559
(Demi sobbing)
Keep pressing, that's fine.

648
00:46:07,642 --> 00:46:09,853
Keep pressing. Keep pressing.

649
00:46:09,936 --> 00:46:11,855
Okay. You're okay.

650
00:46:11,938 --> 00:46:13,314
You're gonna be
fine. Look at me.

651
00:46:13,398 --> 00:46:15,525
Okay, yeah. Look at me.

652
00:46:15,608 --> 00:46:17,652
Is there anyone
else on this island?

653
00:46:17,736 --> 00:46:20,739
No. We came here fishing
with our husbands two days ago.

654
00:46:20,822 --> 00:46:22,115
Okay. Where are they?

655
00:46:22,198 --> 00:46:23,867
They've gone.
They've taken the boat.

656
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,827
They'll be gone for days.

657
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:27,746
(Demi sobbing)

658
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:30,040
Okay. You're
okay, you're okay.

659
00:46:31,332 --> 00:46:32,518
Maybe we should elevate the leg.

660
00:46:32,542 --> 00:46:34,294
- Right.
- Here are a few towels.

661
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:35,086
It's okay. You're
gonna be okay.

662
00:46:35,170 --> 00:46:36,212
You're all right.

663
00:46:36,296 --> 00:46:37,756
- And breathe in.
- Okay.

664
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:39,382
- It's all right.
- Here you go.

665
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:41,277
Here you go, you're okay.
- You're gonna be fine.

666
00:46:41,301 --> 00:46:43,219
Do you have any phone
reception, internet,

667
00:46:43,303 --> 00:46:44,387
any way of getting help?

668
00:46:44,471 --> 00:46:46,598
No. It's all dead.

669
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,850
The, the next island there's
reception and people.

670
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,226
Okay. What about boats?

671
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:52,854
There's, there's a runner boat.

672
00:46:54,314 --> 00:46:57,067
Okay. Can you show us?

673
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:01,988
(waves lapping)

674
00:47:07,202 --> 00:47:09,871
(suspenseful music)

675
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:13,291
That? That's not safe.

676
00:47:14,417 --> 00:47:15,877
Look what it did to the kayaks.

677
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:24,928
Hey, what are you doing?

678
00:47:25,011 --> 00:47:27,514
I'm just gonna have a look.

679
00:47:31,851 --> 00:47:34,729
Wait. I'll come with you.

680
00:47:34,813 --> 00:47:37,482
(water sloshing)

681
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:47,826
(suspenseful music)

682
00:48:51,556 --> 00:48:54,184
(suspenseful music)

683
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:56,978
(water sloshing)

684
00:49:07,572 --> 00:49:09,991
(boat scraping)

685
00:49:10,075 --> 00:49:12,911
(waves lapping)

686
00:49:14,913 --> 00:49:17,165
(Nic sighs)

687
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:26,883
I know we have to help her.

688
00:49:26,966 --> 00:49:29,135
Okay? I know that.

689
00:49:29,219 --> 00:49:31,888
But this, this won't
get us to the island.

690
00:49:33,181 --> 00:49:35,433
You saw what it did to the
kayaks and the pontoon.

691
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:38,977
Jodie?

692
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:41,523
Yeah, it's not great.

693
00:49:46,152 --> 00:49:47,779
So there are no other boats?

694
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:05,422
What if we make it more stable?

695
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:06,881
If we tie one of the kayaks here

696
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,259
and the other one here,
we can make it stable.

697
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:12,053
Yeah, maybe,

698
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,098
but we're still
not gonna be safe.

699
00:50:15,181 --> 00:50:18,518
(soft dramatic music)

700
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:24,315
What are you doing?

701
00:50:24,399 --> 00:50:25,984
I'm going to try it out.

702
00:50:26,067 --> 00:50:29,821
Let me help ya.

703
00:50:29,904 --> 00:50:31,322
Annie.

704
00:50:31,406 --> 00:50:34,159
I know we need to get to
the island, but not like this

705
00:50:36,661 --> 00:50:37,912
Annie, this isn't safe.

706
00:50:38,872 --> 00:50:40,206
We need to get her help.

707
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:41,791
I'm going to get the kayaks.

708
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:45,712
No. Jodie.

709
00:50:45,795 --> 00:50:47,130
Annie, please just wait!

710
00:50:49,090 --> 00:50:51,760
(motor buzzing)

711
00:50:53,928 --> 00:50:54,928
Annie!

712
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:59,017
(intense music)
(water rushing)

713
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:00,352
(Cath screaming)

714
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:03,021
(water bubbling)

715
00:51:03,104 --> 00:51:06,107
(Nic breathes uneasily)

716
00:51:06,191 --> 00:51:08,902
(motor buzzing)

717
00:51:17,827 --> 00:51:20,246
- Is this good?
- Yeah, it's good.

718
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,040
Three, two, one.

719
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:47,440
I can't get it out of my mind.

720
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:51,652
Poor Lisa.

721
00:51:52,529 --> 00:51:55,281
Jodie, come here.

722
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:01,454
Look, what happened
to Lisa was...

723
00:52:03,623 --> 00:52:05,000
But we have to keep going.

724
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:15,093
You made it.
(breathes uneasily)

725
00:52:15,176 --> 00:52:18,263
Yeah, once you get used
to it, it handled okay.

726
00:52:18,346 --> 00:52:20,223
So we just need to
finish trying it here

727
00:52:20,306 --> 00:52:22,434
and then we can go get help.

728
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:23,685
So this is your plan?

729
00:52:25,186 --> 00:52:26,104
Yep.

730
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,187
Yeah, it's that simple?

731
00:52:27,230 --> 00:52:28,857
I guess so.

732
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,817
"Cause what could
possibly go wrong?

733
00:52:31,985 --> 00:52:33,170
Look, if you don't
wanna come, that's fine.

734
00:52:33,194 --> 00:52:34,779
It's not that.

735
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:36,132
We need to slow down and we
need to think this through.

736
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,476
We don't have time to slow down.

737
00:52:37,532 --> 00:52:39,701
Yes, there is. We need
to think this through.

738
00:52:39,784 --> 00:52:40,970
I have thought this through.

739
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:42,234
No you haven't. Not properly.

740
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,496
Would you just listen to me?

741
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,248
This isn't you,
you can't do this!

742
00:52:45,331 --> 00:52:47,959
Don't tell me what
I can and can't do!

743
00:52:48,043 --> 00:52:49,252
You don't know me.

744
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,628
And you know what?

745
00:52:50,712 --> 00:52:53,256
Your sister Cath,
your best friend.

746
00:52:54,382 --> 00:52:55,508
You didn't know her either.

747
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:00,638
(soft dramatic music)

748
00:53:06,227 --> 00:53:09,731
(Nic breathes uneasily)

749
00:53:12,484 --> 00:53:14,694
We have to do something.

750
00:53:16,363 --> 00:53:19,532
(Nic breathes uneasily)

751
00:53:30,210 --> 00:53:33,338
(suspenseful music)

752
00:53:35,590 --> 00:53:36,716
Remember what to do?

753
00:53:37,801 --> 00:53:39,135
- Mm-hmm.
- Hi.

754
00:53:39,219 --> 00:53:40,595
How are you all?

755
00:53:43,306 --> 00:53:45,433
Here. These are for you.

756
00:53:46,976 --> 00:53:48,561
Some protection
if it comes back.

757
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:53,233
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

758
00:53:53,316 --> 00:53:56,403
We pray and make it to
the next island safely.

759
00:53:56,486 --> 00:53:59,322
(waves lapping)

760
00:54:04,452 --> 00:54:07,455
(machete scraping)

761
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:14,254
I'm coming with you.

762
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:17,483
You don't have to
do that, Nic. Really.

763
00:54:17,507 --> 00:54:19,342
Yes, I do.

764
00:54:24,514 --> 00:54:25,514
Okay.

765
00:54:30,437 --> 00:54:33,440
(suspenseful music)

766
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:37,192
Here.

767
00:54:42,157 --> 00:54:43,157
Let's go.

768
00:54:44,284 --> 00:54:46,286
Three, two, one, push.

769
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:17,525
(motor buzzing)

770
00:55:17,609 --> 00:55:20,820
(soft dramatic music)

771
00:55:28,286 --> 00:55:31,081
(water splashing)

772
00:56:05,323 --> 00:56:07,909
(motor buzzing)

773
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:28,263
(waves slapping)

774
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:33,476
Looks like we're
near the channel.

775
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,564
(suspenseful music)

776
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,406
(water sloshing)

777
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:49,534
Shit.

778
00:56:49,617 --> 00:56:51,828
- What?
- We're leaking.

779
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:54,122
Oh shit.

780
00:56:54,205 --> 00:56:55,707
- How bad is it?
- I don't know.

781
00:56:55,790 --> 00:56:58,043
It's hard to tell but
it's definitely coming in.

782
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:01,629
Here, bucket.

783
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:06,343
Where's it coming from?

784
00:57:06,426 --> 00:57:07,528
Can anyone see where
it's coming from?

785
00:57:07,552 --> 00:57:08,887
(Annie gasps)
- Oh shit.

786
00:57:08,970 --> 00:57:09,970
Sorry.

787
00:57:11,139 --> 00:57:12,450
- Let me have a go.
- No, it's all right.

788
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:13,767
I've got it.
- Sit down.

789
00:57:15,352 --> 00:57:18,521
(Nic breathes uneasily)

790
00:57:20,565 --> 00:57:23,276
(motor stalling)

791
00:57:24,527 --> 00:57:29,532
Fuck.

792
00:57:30,033 --> 00:57:32,327
(motor stalling)

793
00:57:34,829 --> 00:57:35,829
Come on.

794
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:39,459
- Check the petrol.
- Come on.

795
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,127
It's not the petrol.

796
00:57:41,961 --> 00:57:42,961
Please, check.

797
00:57:48,843 --> 00:57:53,848
(suspenseful music)
(water burbling)

798
00:57:56,142 --> 00:57:57,142
It's half full.

799
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,397
Maybe we hit something.
Check the prop.

800
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,191
I don't think so.
I would've felt it.

801
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:06,152
(motor clattering)
Oh, shit.

802
00:58:06,236 --> 00:58:08,947
(water burbling)

803
00:58:12,409 --> 00:58:14,494
Here, let me have a go.

804
00:58:27,007 --> 00:58:29,551
(suspenseful music)

805
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:32,554
(motor clattering)

806
00:58:36,391 --> 00:58:37,809
(water splashing)

807
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:40,645
(Nic gasping)

808
00:58:47,902 --> 00:58:48,987
What is it?

809
00:58:50,822 --> 00:58:51,822
Nic?

810
00:58:57,078 --> 00:58:59,289
I thought I heard something.

811
00:58:59,372 --> 00:59:01,958
(water sloshing)

812
00:59:12,218 --> 00:59:14,888
(motor stalling)

813
00:59:16,723 --> 00:59:17,766
Fuck!

814
00:59:21,269 --> 00:59:23,164
I knew we shouldn't have
come out here in this thing.

815
00:59:23,188 --> 00:59:24,647
Well, we had to do something.

816
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:28,735
Look I know, but not in this!

817
00:59:28,818 --> 00:59:30,153
I said you didn't have to come.

818
00:59:30,236 --> 00:59:31,672
I said that Jodie and
I were gonna do it.

819
00:59:31,696 --> 00:59:34,366
(scoffing) Like that
would have changed anything!

820
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:35,760
This still would've
happened, Annie!

821
00:59:35,784 --> 00:59:37,744
Okay. Well at least
I tried something.

822
00:59:37,827 --> 00:59:40,205
At least I did something and
I didn't run away like you.

823
00:59:40,288 --> 00:59:41,915
- Fuck you!
- No, fuck you!

824
00:59:41,998 --> 00:59:44,084
All right, all right. Enough.

825
00:59:44,167 --> 00:59:46,336
(soft dramatic music)

826
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:47,671
All we can do is paddle.

827
00:59:48,672 --> 00:59:49,673
So let's paddle.

828
01:00:13,863 --> 01:00:16,658
(oars splashing)

829
01:00:46,271 --> 01:00:47,689
What did you mean

830
01:00:49,858 --> 01:00:51,192
back at the beach?

831
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,113
What did you mean when you said

832
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:56,596
I didn't know who
you and Cath were?

833
01:00:57,949 --> 01:01:00,577
Oh, nothing.

834
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:01,660
It was nothing.

835
01:01:02,620 --> 01:01:03,788
Can you just tell me?

836
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:06,791
Okay.

837
01:01:09,502 --> 01:01:11,338
Well, you didn't
come to the funeral,

838
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:15,675
and then the next day you
are out of the country

839
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:16,885
and you haven't come back.

840
01:01:20,013 --> 01:01:22,432
I was left holding
it all together.

841
01:01:23,767 --> 01:01:27,270
The funeral, the police inquiry.

842
01:01:27,354 --> 01:01:29,647
Mom's depression. Mine.

843
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:34,235
I'm not as weak
as you think I am.

844
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:35,612
Who said you were weak?

845
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:38,907
And Cath, she
wasn't weak either.

846
01:01:41,076 --> 01:01:44,371
You didn't know her
and you don't know me.

847
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:46,580
You left.

848
01:01:56,341 --> 01:01:57,384
I couldn't.

849
01:02:02,430 --> 01:02:03,848
I just couldn't.

850
01:02:11,898 --> 01:02:14,818
(oars splashing)

851
01:02:16,778 --> 01:02:19,864
(suspenseful music)

852
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:34,796
Hey, look.

853
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:46,766
Paddle. Come on, paddle.

854
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:49,853
(paddles splashing)

855
01:03:03,158 --> 01:03:06,786
(Annie breathes uneasily)

856
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:33,855
(water splashing)

857
01:03:40,195 --> 01:03:41,863
(shark slamming)
(all gasping)

858
01:03:41,946 --> 01:03:44,783
(intense music)

859
01:03:51,122 --> 01:03:52,122
Annie!

860
01:03:53,249 --> 01:03:55,919
(water rushing)

861
01:03:56,002 --> 01:03:57,003
(Cath gasping)

862
01:03:57,087 --> 01:03:58,171
Annie!

863
01:03:58,254 --> 01:03:59,631
(water bubbling)

864
01:03:59,714 --> 01:04:00,757
(Cath gasping)

865
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:04,260
(water bubbling)

866
01:04:04,344 --> 01:04:06,930
(Annie gasping)

867
01:04:09,015 --> 01:04:10,015
Annie!

868
01:04:10,975 --> 01:04:13,978
(water sloshing)

869
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:15,271
Annie, slowly.

870
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:21,319
That's it. Stay calm.

871
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,700
(water burbling)

872
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:32,872
(Annie whimpering)

873
01:04:32,956 --> 01:04:33,956
Come on.

874
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:38,253
(Annie breathes uneasily)

875
01:04:38,336 --> 01:04:41,006
(water burbling)

876
01:04:43,967 --> 01:04:47,345
(Annie breathes uneasily)

877
01:04:51,808 --> 01:04:53,518
(shark thrashing)
(Annie screaming)

878
01:04:53,601 --> 01:04:56,771
(water bubbling)

879
01:04:56,855 --> 01:04:57,939
Annie!

880
01:04:58,023 --> 01:04:59,983
(intense music)

881
01:05:00,066 --> 01:05:01,066
Annie!

882
01:05:02,861 --> 01:05:03,861
Annie!

883
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:07,657
Where is she? Where is she?

884
01:05:09,242 --> 01:05:10,285
There she is!

885
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:12,037
(suspenseful music)

886
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:13,997
(vest unzips)

887
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:17,125
(water splashing)

888
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:22,339
(Jodie gasps)

889
01:05:26,634 --> 01:05:29,012
(Nic gasping)

890
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:33,141
Annie! Annie, come on!
(Annie coughing)

891
01:05:33,224 --> 01:05:34,309
You're, you're okay.

892
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:36,186
I've got you. I've got you.

893
01:05:36,269 --> 01:05:38,980
(Annie coughing)

894
01:05:45,779 --> 01:05:46,779
Okay. Okay.

895
01:05:50,241 --> 01:05:51,534
All right. Come on.

896
01:05:51,618 --> 01:05:52,994
(suspenseful music)

897
01:05:53,078 --> 01:05:55,997
(water burbling)

898
01:06:00,043 --> 01:06:02,837
(Nic panting)

899
01:06:02,921 --> 01:06:03,921
Come on.

900
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,470
Come on.

901
01:06:14,182 --> 01:06:16,017
You're okay.

902
01:06:16,101 --> 01:06:17,310
Come on.
(Annie groaning)

903
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:18,478
I've got you.

904
01:06:19,521 --> 01:06:20,689
That's it, come on.

905
01:06:20,772 --> 01:06:22,148
Uh!

906
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:23,108
You're all right. It's okay.

907
01:06:23,191 --> 01:06:24,025
Come on. I've got you.

908
01:06:24,109 --> 01:06:26,111
Let me see. Let me see.

909
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:29,447
Come on.

910
01:06:29,531 --> 01:06:31,074
Here. Get this off.

911
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:32,826
Get this off.

912
01:06:32,909 --> 01:06:35,745
Oh, my God. Just
got the life jacket.

913
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:38,331
Oh my God. It missed you.

914
01:06:38,415 --> 01:06:40,875
It missed you.
- Oh!

915
01:06:40,959 --> 01:06:43,336
(both crying)

916
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:52,429
(soft dramatic music)

917
01:06:52,512 --> 01:06:53,805
You're alive.

918
01:06:54,973 --> 01:06:56,057
You're alive.

919
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:59,227
I'm sorry for everything,

920
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:01,771
for not being there to help you,

921
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:04,190
for not being at the
funeral, just everything.

922
01:07:06,568 --> 01:07:08,168
I just, I couldn't,
I couldn't, I just...

923
01:07:13,658 --> 01:07:17,162
I could have done
something. I...

924
01:07:17,245 --> 01:07:19,706
(Nic sobbing)

925
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:24,336
I should have known. I
could have done something.

926
01:07:24,419 --> 01:07:28,214
Save my sister, I should
have done something.

927
01:07:29,341 --> 01:07:31,551
No one knew. That's
the worst part.

928
01:07:31,634 --> 01:07:33,345
She never said anything.

929
01:07:33,428 --> 01:07:35,138
(Nic sobbing)

930
01:07:35,221 --> 01:07:38,433
(soft dramatic music)

931
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,157
(water spraying)

932
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:57,243
(suspenseful music)

933
01:07:58,703 --> 01:08:02,957
(intense music)
(Jodie gasping)

934
01:08:03,041 --> 01:08:05,126
Oh, God. It's still here.

935
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,381
What the fuck? Fuck off!

936
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:12,217
Shit!

937
01:08:14,969 --> 01:08:17,347
(all gasping)

938
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:22,435
- I can't see it anywhere.
- Oh, fuck.

939
01:08:22,519 --> 01:08:25,146
(whimpering)

940
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:29,400
There!

941
01:08:48,128 --> 01:08:49,128
Fuck.

942
01:08:56,344 --> 01:08:58,930
Oh my God. Oh my God.

943
01:08:59,014 --> 01:09:01,641
Why doesn't it leave
us the fuck alone?

944
01:09:01,725 --> 01:09:04,728
(suspenseful music)

945
01:09:08,148 --> 01:09:10,233
Nic, what are we gonna do?

946
01:09:12,861 --> 01:09:14,237
We have to get to that island.

947
01:09:14,320 --> 01:09:16,322
(water sloshing)

948
01:09:16,406 --> 01:09:17,699
We have to keep paddling.

949
01:09:23,997 --> 01:09:24,997
Nic?

950
01:09:29,127 --> 01:09:30,127
Nic?

951
01:09:31,338 --> 01:09:32,922
No.

952
01:09:33,006 --> 01:09:33,840
No?

953
01:09:33,923 --> 01:09:34,923
No more paddling.

954
01:09:37,927 --> 01:09:39,095
What, what do you mean?

955
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:41,723
That thing is stalking us.

956
01:09:41,806 --> 01:09:43,266
Okay, I don't know why,

957
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:44,493
if it's the paddling or what,

958
01:09:44,517 --> 01:09:47,228
but it's hunting us and
it's not gonna stop.

959
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:49,606
We head for that island,
it'll come for us again.

960
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:52,776
We have to get rid of it.

961
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:55,278
We need to kill it.
- (chuckles) Are you crazy?

962
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:56,863
It's a huge fucking shark.

963
01:09:56,946 --> 01:09:58,948
How are we going to do that?

964
01:09:59,032 --> 01:10:00,367
Do we still have that fish?

965
01:10:02,243 --> 01:10:03,703
Yeah, why?

966
01:10:03,787 --> 01:10:04,787
We trap it.

967
01:10:05,705 --> 01:10:06,905
We put the fish on the anchor,

968
01:10:06,956 --> 01:10:08,750
then we tie the
anchor to the kayak.

969
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:10,311
When it takes it, it'll
get stuck to the kayak,

970
01:10:10,335 --> 01:10:11,419
and it'll drown.

971
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:14,756
This is ridiculous.

972
01:10:14,839 --> 01:10:17,342
To beat it, we're gonna have
to try something different.

973
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,904
We're not gonna outrun
it. We're just not.

974
01:10:19,928 --> 01:10:23,848
(soft dramatic music)

975
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:24,932
Annie?

976
01:10:26,351 --> 01:10:27,394
I'm in.

977
01:10:34,025 --> 01:10:35,025
Jodie?

978
01:10:44,577 --> 01:10:47,163
Come on. Help me untie this.

979
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:48,248
Okay.

980
01:10:52,419 --> 01:10:53,712
Okay. Got it.

981
01:11:07,392 --> 01:11:10,645
(wood splashing)

982
01:11:10,729 --> 01:11:12,188
(hook stabs)
(anchor plops)

983
01:11:12,272 --> 01:11:15,275
(suspenseful music)

984
01:11:33,501 --> 01:11:36,212
(water sloshing)

985
01:11:50,435 --> 01:11:53,521
(suspenseful music)

986
01:12:20,674 --> 01:12:22,050
Wonder if it's gone.

987
01:12:27,180 --> 01:12:29,391
I mean, if it's gone, we
should be going for the island.

988
01:12:33,353 --> 01:12:34,396
Hasn't gone.

989
01:12:36,648 --> 01:12:37,816
How do you know that?

990
01:12:38,817 --> 01:12:40,527
Because it won't.

991
01:12:44,155 --> 01:12:45,281
Jodie's got a point.

992
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:47,367
If it's not here,
then we should be

993
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:48,785
paddling for the island, right?

994
01:12:50,203 --> 01:12:51,579
I mean, we're losing time.

995
01:12:53,498 --> 01:12:56,793
Nic, if it comes,
we'll take our positions.

996
01:12:59,170 --> 01:13:00,338
Exactly.

997
01:13:00,422 --> 01:13:01,482
We have to get going
and get help for the...

998
01:13:01,506 --> 01:13:04,134
(suspenseful music)
(water rushing)

999
01:13:04,217 --> 01:13:06,845
Oh my God. It hasn't gone.

1000
01:13:06,928 --> 01:13:09,973
(Nic gasping)

1001
01:13:10,056 --> 01:13:10,932
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

1002
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:12,142
I don't know.

1003
01:13:13,143 --> 01:13:14,143
Where did it go?

1004
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:16,980
[Annie] Oh, fuck.

1005
01:13:20,108 --> 01:13:21,860
Where the fuck is it?

1006
01:13:21,943 --> 01:13:24,612
(water sloshing)

1007
01:13:28,366 --> 01:13:31,036
(rope splashing)

1008
01:13:31,911 --> 01:13:33,455
(intense music)
(all gasping)

1009
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:36,124
(water rushing)

1010
01:13:38,460 --> 01:13:40,003
(rope creaking)

1011
01:13:40,086 --> 01:13:41,504
Undo the rope! Undo the rope!

1012
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,340
Jodie, undo the rope!

1013
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,884
- Hold on!
- Jodie!

1014
01:13:45,967 --> 01:13:47,552
Jodie! Oh fuck!

1015
01:13:47,635 --> 01:13:49,929
(intense music)

1016
01:13:50,013 --> 01:13:51,514
(water rushing)

1017
01:13:51,598 --> 01:13:54,642
Jodie, hurry up!
- Jodie, untie it!

1018
01:13:55,435 --> 01:13:56,603
Come on!

1019
01:13:56,686 --> 01:13:59,105
(machete scraping)

1020
01:13:59,189 --> 01:14:00,357
Hurry up!
(machete clinks)

1021
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,068
(rope whooshing)

1022
01:14:06,738 --> 01:14:09,532
(kayak splashing)

1023
01:14:17,374 --> 01:14:20,043
(water sloshing)

1024
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:24,506
Whoo! (laughing)

1025
01:14:24,589 --> 01:14:25,589
We did it!

1026
01:14:26,549 --> 01:14:27,884
We got it!

1027
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,552
We got it.

1028
01:14:29,636 --> 01:14:30,636
It worked. It worked.

1029
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:33,598
Oh, we actually got it.

1030
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:36,226
(Annie laughing)

1031
01:14:36,309 --> 01:14:37,309
We did.

1032
01:14:39,229 --> 01:14:40,229
Yeah.

1033
01:14:45,068 --> 01:14:46,528
Wow.

1034
01:14:46,611 --> 01:14:47,987
We should paddle.

1035
01:14:48,071 --> 01:14:51,366
Yeah, we'll go faster
if we all paddle.

1036
01:14:51,449 --> 01:14:52,826
Let's get rid of this.

1037
01:14:52,909 --> 01:14:54,327
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1038
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:55,995
(bright music)
(ropes rustling)

1039
01:14:56,079 --> 01:14:58,748
(water sloshing)

1040
01:15:14,973 --> 01:15:16,891
(Annie chuckles)

1041
01:15:16,975 --> 01:15:19,519
(sighs) Let's go.

1042
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:20,854
Yeah, let's go.

1043
01:15:23,815 --> 01:15:26,526
(oars splashing)

1044
01:15:37,370 --> 01:15:39,539
- We're almost there.
- Yeah.

1045
01:15:42,751 --> 01:15:46,463
(water splashing)

1046
01:15:46,546 --> 01:15:49,549
(suspenseful music)

1047
01:16:01,686 --> 01:16:04,731
(water splashing)

1048
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,777
(Annie gasping)

1049
01:16:12,697 --> 01:16:15,283
(water rushing)

1050
01:16:19,954 --> 01:16:22,665
(Nic whimpering)

1051
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:25,418
(water sloshing)

1052
01:16:46,398 --> 01:16:47,649
(shark slams)
(Jodie gasps)

1053
01:16:47,732 --> 01:16:49,192
(intense music)
(water bubbling)

1054
01:16:49,275 --> 01:16:50,819
- Jodie!
- Jodie!

1055
01:16:52,696 --> 01:16:54,739
(Jodie gasping)

1056
01:16:54,823 --> 01:16:56,241
Paddle, quick!

1057
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,576
Nic, it's coming!

1058
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:00,578
Jodie, go, go!

1059
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:03,331
(water burbling)

1060
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:06,209
Jodie, give me your hand!

1061
01:17:06,292 --> 01:17:07,210
That's it.

1062
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:09,170
(intense music)
(water burbling)

1063
01:17:09,254 --> 01:17:10,254
Oh!

1064
01:17:12,007 --> 01:17:13,425
Pull! Come on!

1065
01:17:15,844 --> 01:17:18,763
(Jodie gasping)

1066
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:22,100
You're okay. We've got you.

1067
01:17:22,183 --> 01:17:23,183
You okay?

1068
01:17:24,102 --> 01:17:26,146
Can you stand?
- Uh-huh.

1069
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:28,148
(screams) It's my
shoulder, it's my shoulder!

1070
01:17:28,231 --> 01:17:29,941
All right. Hold it
close to your chest.

1071
01:17:30,025 --> 01:17:32,861
(groaning) Shit!

1072
01:17:32,944 --> 01:17:34,654
All right. Ready?

1073
01:17:35,613 --> 01:17:36,698
One, two...

1074
01:17:36,781 --> 01:17:37,800
Oh shit.
(Jodie groaning)

1075
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:38,658
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1076
01:17:38,742 --> 01:17:40,785
I'm gonna put your arm in.

1077
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:42,579
I've got you. It's
gonna be okay.

1078
01:17:42,662 --> 01:17:43,747
(Jodie groaning)

1079
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:45,457
All right.

1080
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:46,458
Hey.

1081
01:17:46,541 --> 01:17:49,252
(Jodie groaning)

1082
01:17:50,754 --> 01:17:51,754
Okay.

1083
01:17:52,797 --> 01:17:54,716
You're gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

1084
01:17:54,799 --> 01:17:55,633
Yeah?

1085
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:58,428
(Angie panting)

1086
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:01,597
Oh my God.

1087
01:18:05,101 --> 01:18:06,269
Shit.

1088
01:18:06,353 --> 01:18:09,147
(water sloshing)

1089
01:18:12,901 --> 01:18:13,901
Nic, get down.

1090
01:18:13,943 --> 01:18:16,946
(suspenseful music)

1091
01:18:21,409 --> 01:18:26,414
Where'd it go? (panting)

1092
01:18:26,915 --> 01:18:27,915
Where is it?

1093
01:18:31,002 --> 01:18:34,464
Oh, it's there. It was there.

1094
01:18:34,547 --> 01:18:35,548
Oh my God.

1095
01:18:42,555 --> 01:18:45,266
(water burbling)

1096
01:18:50,730 --> 01:18:53,692
(intense music)

1097
01:18:53,775 --> 01:18:55,694
Oh my God! It's coming!

1098
01:18:55,777 --> 01:18:58,655
It's coming, Nic! It's coming!

1099
01:18:58,738 --> 01:18:59,864
Shit. Shit.

1100
01:19:05,912 --> 01:19:08,623
(Jodie gasping)

1101
01:19:10,792 --> 01:19:12,061
Okay, the trap didn't work, we-

1102
01:19:12,085 --> 01:19:13,753
(intense music)
(shark thrashing)

1103
01:19:13,837 --> 01:19:15,672
(all screaming)

1104
01:19:15,755 --> 01:19:20,760
(shark slamming)
(water splashing)

1105
01:19:25,724 --> 01:19:28,518
(shark thrashing)

1106
01:19:30,729 --> 01:19:33,231
(Nic gasping)

1107
01:19:40,905 --> 01:19:42,323
You okay?
- Yeah.

1108
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:43,700
You?

1109
01:19:43,783 --> 01:19:44,868
- Annie, you okay?
- Yeah.

1110
01:19:44,951 --> 01:19:45,994
Good.

1111
01:19:47,037 --> 01:19:48,621
Oh shit. We're filling up.

1112
01:19:48,705 --> 01:19:52,292
(suspenseful music)

1113
01:19:52,375 --> 01:19:53,835
Where's the bucket?

1114
01:19:53,918 --> 01:19:54,918
We're fucking sinking.

1115
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:58,214
How are we gonna
get to the island?

1116
01:19:58,298 --> 01:19:59,716
What are we gonna do?

1117
01:19:59,799 --> 01:20:03,511
(suspenseful music)

1118
01:20:03,595 --> 01:20:06,473
(water splashing)

1119
01:20:13,563 --> 01:20:14,790
We're gonna trap
it and drown it.

1120
01:20:14,814 --> 01:20:17,901
- Yeah.
- Okay?

1121
01:20:17,984 --> 01:20:19,486
Kill it. Just kill it.

1122
01:20:19,569 --> 01:20:20,569
Yeah.

1123
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:22,655
Okay

1124
01:20:22,739 --> 01:20:25,825
(suspenseful music)

1125
01:20:26,993 --> 01:20:28,411
Hey, help with this.

1126
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:29,680
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna trap it

1127
01:20:29,704 --> 01:20:30,704
in the net.

1128
01:20:32,207 --> 01:20:34,751
Here, tie it. Make
sure it's tied tight.

1129
01:20:34,834 --> 01:20:37,504
(intense music)

1130
01:20:58,024 --> 01:20:58,817
Grab the net.

1131
01:20:58,900 --> 01:21:00,527
When I say throw, you throw.

1132
01:21:00,610 --> 01:21:03,029
Hey, no matter what happens,
we get to the island.

1133
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:04,614
Okay?
- Okay, what about you?

1134
01:21:04,698 --> 01:21:06,574
Don't worry about me.

1135
01:21:07,992 --> 01:21:09,345
- Nic, what about you?
- Just do it!

1136
01:21:09,369 --> 01:21:10,954
(intense music)
(water rushing)

1137
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:12,539
Throw! Throw!

1138
01:21:12,622 --> 01:21:13,790
(water splashing)

1139
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:14,958
Oh shit!

1140
01:21:15,041 --> 01:21:18,128
(shark thrashing)

1141
01:21:18,211 --> 01:21:20,005
(Annie yelps)

1142
01:21:20,088 --> 01:21:20,797
Annie!

1143

(water bubbling)

1144
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,304
Where's the machete?

1145
01:21:30,056 --> 01:21:31,683
(machete plops)
Oh shit!

1146
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:34,352
(intense music)

1147
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:38,106
(water bubbling)

1148
01:21:43,987 --> 01:21:45,739
(shark chomping)

1149
01:21:45,822 --> 01:21:49,451
(Cath gasping and screaming)

1150
01:21:58,376 --> 01:22:00,962

1151
01:22:13,475 --> 01:22:15,226
(intense music)

1152
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,104
(shark thrashing)

1153

Annie. (gasping)

1158
01:23:21,167 --> 01:23:22,877
Annie. Annie, please!

1159
01:23:24,713 --> 01:23:26,089
Annie! Annie, hey.

1160
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:31,219
(Annie coughing)

1161
01:23:32,804 --> 01:23:33,804
Oh my God.

1162
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:36,933
Are you, are you okay?

1163
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:38,601
- Yeah.
- It's okay.

1164
01:23:38,685 --> 01:23:40,687
It's okay. I've got you.

1165
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:43,106
Here we go.

1166
01:23:43,189 --> 01:23:46,151
(soft dramatic music)
(Annie cries)

1167
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,737
It's okay. It's okay.

Oh, it's Demi.

- Hello, hi!
- Hey, Demi!

1173
01:24:29,194 --> 01:24:29,903
How are you?

1174
01:24:29,986 --> 01:24:31,571
Good. Really good.

1175
01:24:31,654 --> 01:24:33,448
Hey, Demi. How's your leg?

1176
01:24:33,531 --> 01:24:34,908
See?

1177
01:24:34,991 --> 01:24:36,868
That is gonna be
a beauty of a scar.

1178
01:24:36,951 --> 01:24:40,038
Huh, I know. I'm now
known as shark girl.

1179
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:41,998
The girl that...

1184
01:25:53,194 --> 01:25:55,238
To Cath and Lisa.

1185
01:25:58,158 --> 01:26:01,828
You'll always be
with us forever.

1186
01:26:07,417 --> 01:26:09,377
Always in our hearts.

1187
01:26:12,714 --> 01:26:14,883
