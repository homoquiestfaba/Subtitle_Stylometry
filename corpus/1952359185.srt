00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,996
EIGHT MONTHS LATER

1
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,838
Ready?

2
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,956
Let's do it.

3
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,670
Addy.

4
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,476
Come on, Addy. Let's go.

5
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,713
- Can I wait till the end of this song?
- Why? You're wearing a Walkman.

6
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,509
What the fuck do you think
they call it a Walkman for?

7
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,592
What's wrong with you?

8
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,990
I'm sorry.

9
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,034
I'm a little edgy.

10
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,113
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Yeah.

11
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,274
You wouldn't do this unless
you thought it was a good idea, right?

12
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,838
- Right.
- That's enough for me.

13
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,430
You're my baby? Give me a kiss.

14
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,599
This is our chance
for something better, right?

15
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,516
Let's go.

16
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,630
- You got any change for the meter?
- No.

17
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,356
- What about that quarter?
- That's my special quarter.

18
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,432
- Why?
- You wouldn't understand.

19
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,309
- Is it a concept that's beyond me?
- You wouldn't believe it.

20
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,233
- Try me, Curtis.
- I don't think so.

21
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,198
I would like to hear the story.

22
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,638
Granted, I didn't look at it closely,
but it looked like an ordinary quarter.

23
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,509
It's not what it is, man.
It's what it represents.

24
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,271
Fine, you want to hear it?

25
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,115
This dude was telling me a story
about some cat who flipped a quarter -

26
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,319
- and it landed on its edge.
What are the chances of that happening?

27
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,756
Because it lands on its edge,
he can read people's minds.

28
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:48,708
If I can get one to land on its edge,
I can do that too.

29
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,997
That's an old episode of
"The Twilight Zone".

30
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,314
- What?
- That's "The Twilight Zone", dog.

31
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,313
- Half that stuff's true.
- No, it's all fiction.

32
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:02,519
I told you you wouldn't believe it.
You're a bona fide sceptic.

33
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:07,435
I don't see how someone can read
people's minds because of a coin.

34
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,876
Wouldn't the story be better
if the guy got hit by lightning -

35
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,270
- or took some experimental drug?

36
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,512
Then maybe I could buy into it,
but a coin on its side...

37
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,752
It's not my fucking story, Addy.

38
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:23,595
As I recall the story, there was
nothing special about the coin.

39
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:28,231
Did the guy say there was
anything special about the coin?

40
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,597
- No.
- Then give me the fucking quarter.

41
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,913
There's your fucking quarter.

42
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,799
- I think we can do business.
- What kind of weight?

43
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,758
It depends on
how much money you've brought.

44
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,074
- What the hell are you doing here?
- You said nothing about guns.

45
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,676
- Shut the fuck up, Marcus!
- Hey, what are you doing here?

46
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,913
- You told me no one would be here.
- There wasn't supposed to be.

47
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,832
Come on, Raymond.

48
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,757
Raymond, you dumb cocksucker!

49
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,878
Do you think you're going to
move up on me?

50
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,595
- Think you can treat me like a punk?
- Shut up, Eddie.

51
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,671
Get the cases.

52
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,276
This is how you repay me
after everything I did for you?

53
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:55,195
What did you do for me, Eddie?
I did two years for you!

54
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,512
You give me a job moving crates.
Fuck you and what you did for me!

55
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,912
You haven't thought this through.

56
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:10,709
You're ripping me off.
That's the easy part.

57
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,599
Living with what comes after
is the hard part.

58
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,675
If you make this play,
how far do you think you'll get?

59
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,229
I'll fucking tell you!

60
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:25,359
The whole goddamned world
is not big enough to cover you ass!

61
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,274
Have you seen yourself?
You should take a look at yourself.

62
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,750
- You just pissed your pants.
- Shut up. You pissed your pants.

63
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,990
Shut the fuck up, Eddie!

64
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,118
Hey, muffin.
Your boyfriend pissed his pants.

65
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,997
- What did you do that for?
- You crazy motherfucker!

66
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,436
We're dead, Curtis. You fucked us.

67
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,319
Please. I've got a family.
Let me show you...

68
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:59,310
- He was going for a gun!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

69
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,711
Shit! He's a fucking cop!

70
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,916
You shot a goddamn cop, Curtis!

71
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,314
He's wearing a wire.
Pick up the fucking case!

72
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,552
You shot a fucking cop!
What are we going to do?

73
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,472
Pick it up!

74
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,835
Pick up the case.

75
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,111
Come on, come on!

76
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,390
Get in the back. Get down.

77
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,109
Don't shoot!

78
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,590
Shut up, Marcus!

79
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,468
Oh, shit.

80
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,870
- Come on.
- Move!

81
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,116
Go!

82
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,510
Request back-up! Officer down!

83
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,793
Curtis, don't!

84
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,476
- You said no one would be there.
- Nobody was supposed to be.

85
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,349
We had a situation arise
and we dealt with it.

86
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,318
No, you dealt with it!

87
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,835
All that craziness was yours!

88
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,950
- This was supposed to be a simple buy.
- Fine. It was my fault. Can we move on?

89
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,510
How many drug dealers are there
in this state, Curtis?

90
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,513
How many do you think
will get ripped off today?

91
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,671
And how many of them -

92
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:11,879
- will have a fucking undercover cop
in their fucking office?!

93
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,477
The odds must be a billion to one.
I need a computer to figure it out.

94
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,995
Are you finished yet?

95
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,478
- Dump the car.
- She's right, Curtis.

96
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,870
This was my daddy's car.

97
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,756
It's got a 350 bored out to a 386.

98
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,152
I don't care if it's got a pussy!
We've got to get rid of it!

99
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,517
Why's everybody yelling at me?
It went pretty well.

100
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:35,317
- How long are we going to stay here?
- Until I say it's time to leave.

101
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,794
- We have to come up with a new plan.
- We should run like hell.

102
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,758
No wonder you've been in prison twice.

103
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,833
Running like hell is no kind of plan.

104
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,198
Running is a damn sight better
than standing around.

105
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,999
That's your slave mentality talking.

106
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,709
You don't know
what you're talking about.

107
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:03,112
Why did every slave who tried to
book off the plantation get caught?

108
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:06,989
He didn't have a plan.
He didn't know where he was going.

109
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,598
First of all, I'm no fucking slave.
Secondly, this is no plantation.

110
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:17,675
And we wouldn't be in this situation
if you weren't so trigger-happy.

111
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,317
We've got to look at the big picture.
People are dead.

112
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,392
It wasn't supposed to happen.

113
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,190
Curtis, that cop had a family!
We took it all away from him.

114
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,715
There's nothing we can do
to give it back!

115
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,112
I didn't plan this.
That's life. Shit happens.

116
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,158
You knew there were going to be risks,
so stop sitting there like some bitch!

117
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:47,549
- Watch how you fucking talk to her!
- Get out of my face.

118
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,188
We don't have time for this shit.

119
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,749
This shit is happening because of you.

120
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,515
When it comes to her, there's a line.
The next time you cross it...

121
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,912
- What? Tell me what you'll do.
- You guys click this shit off!

122
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,833
You're not helping the situation.

123
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,073
- I don't want an apology from you.
- Knock it off!

124
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,196
Let's take a deep breath.

125
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,558
Deflate your balls a little.
Let some blood go back to your brains.

126
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,349
You know something?
I'll stand by you through anything.

127
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:29,752
But if you ever fuck with her again,
I'll fucking leave you flat.

128
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:38,316
Bitch.

129
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,508
Honey, we have to go.

130
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,757
I'm sorry.

131
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,036
Sorry for what?

132
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,311
I'm sorry for getting you into this.

133
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,873
You didn't get me into nothing, Ray.
It was my choice to come along.

134
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,919
It wasn't supposed to be like this.

135
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,392
If I knew it would be like this,
I wouldn't have...

136
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,199
I know that.

137
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,920
It's not your fault.

138
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,392
We got into this together
and we'll get out together.

139
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,599
How do you want to play this?

140
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:54,552
We have to play it like we planned.

141
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,875
Go to Vago.

142
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:02,716
We sell the dope.
Then we can book down to Mexico.

143
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,638
- I love you.
- I love you back.

144
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,950
Come on.

145
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,153
It's okay. Just be calm.
I'll handle them, okay?

146
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,518
Good afternoon.

147
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:21,478
- How are you guys doing?
- Our car is overheating.

148
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,038
- You're having a picnic.
- What have you got?

149
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,512
We've got some wine and bread,
cheese, fruit -

150
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,671
- and some prosciutto.

151
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,229
It's Italian deli food.

152
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,035
Damn, that's ham, dog.

153
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,630
Some good fucking ham.

154
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,399
- So have you got a vehicle?
- Yes.

155
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,279
What d'you say you give us a ride?

156
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,878
The thing is, we're not comfortable
giving a ride to strangers.

157
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,517
A cautious man. I can dig that.
You can't be too careful.

158
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,636
I'm glad you understand.

159
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,795
Did I say we understood?

160
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,755
Why don't you just take what you want?

161
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,230
What do we look like?
Fucking prosciutto bandits?

162
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,789
Where's your car?

163
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,519
On the other side of the barn.

164
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,989
Let's go take a look-see. Up we go.

165
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,631
Come on.

166
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,829
That's your car?

167
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,514
We'll just have to make it work.
Come on, show me.

168
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,355
What are you doing?
No more killing.

169
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,875
- I think...
- You don't think!

170
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,395
That's the problem.

171
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,916
Why don't we take them with us?
We might need them.

172
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,957
That's thinking.

173
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,837
- You drive.
- Don't make us go with you.

174
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:27,398
- What are your names?
- I'm Gordon and this is Donna.

175
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,552
Well, Gordon and Donna. Hop in.

176
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,756
Wait, we're not going to say anything.

177
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,751
Gordon, right? The next time I tell you
to do something, you do it.

178
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,549
Your life means nothing to me.
We're bringing you for protection.

179
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:48,792
You cross me once
and your life ends. Understand?

180
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,318
Good. So, Gordon and Donna. Hop on in.

181
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,234
Frank, you know Alan Gryder.

182
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,996
So, let's have it.

183
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:06,153
A few months ago, we got word a dealer
named Eddie Grillo was moving up.

184
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,551
He got a connection
that could supply 100 keys a month.

185
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:13,633
- How did we get this information?
- On a phone tap.

186
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,392
Do we know who killed him?

187
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:18,359
Raymond Lembecke, Addy Monroe, -

188
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:23,355
- Curtis Freeley and Marcus Weans.
We got them on this surveillance tape.

189
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,593
- What have the police got on them?
- Raymond got out eight months ago.

190
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,274
- He did two years on possession.
- How much?

191
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,874
- A key.
- That's a lot for a small-timer.

192
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:36,271
It was Grillo's.
Lembecke wouldn't roll over on him.

193
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,595
Grillo gave him a job in the warehouse.
My guess is Lembecke felt he was owed.

194
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,149
Grillo wasn't giving, so he took.

195
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,552
Addy Monroe is Lembecke's girlfriend.
She has no priors.

196
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,029
Curtis Freeley is as bad as they come.

197
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,113
He's been in the joint twice.
For possession and assault with intent.

198
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:59,875
When he was inside,
he was Lembecke's muscle.

199
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:03,635
He's been in and out his whole life.
His record is extensive.

200
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,873
- And Weans?
- That's where we've got a problem.

201
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,600
Marcus Weans is one of ours.

202
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,914
Marcus, we've got to go!

203
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,189
Come on, Marcus, we've got to go!

204
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,717
- What are you doing?
- Can't a brother take a piss?

205
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:11,039
- May I ask what you're running from?
- No, you may not.

206
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:18,349
- It's got to do with drugs, right?
- Look, just do what you're told.

207
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,751
All they want to do
is sell it and disappear.

208
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,555
- "They"?
- I said "we".

209
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,792
- No, you said "they".
- Shut the fuck up.

210
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,720
You know what? Turn around.

211
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,919
- The highway is up here.
- Gordon, I know where the highway is.

212
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,556
What are you doing, Addy?

213
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,714
I figure we got a bad jump on this one.
The highway is crawling with cops.

214
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,395
What do we need to run for?
We have everything right here.

215
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,348
Why don't we head up into the hills,
chill out for the night, rest...

216
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,431
Let the heat die down.

217
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,477
Sounds good.

218
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,993
Hey, Gordon!

219
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,310
Turn around.

220
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:59,469
Ray, I know you and Curtis are tight,
but you have got to cut him loose now.

221
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,074
- What?
- He's out of control.

222
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,153
- If I left Curtis, he'd be dead.
- One of us is going to end up dead.

223
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,677
- Don't talk like that. It's bad karma.
- I'm serious, Ray.

224
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:15,755
We have to get past the next few days.
After Vago, it'll be clear sailing.

225
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,992
Don't worry about Curtis.
I can handle him.

226
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:23,711
- What if something happened to me?
- I don't want to think about that.

227
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,075
No, what would you do?

228
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,438
If something happened to you,
I wouldn't want to be alive.

229
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,397
- Really?
- Yes, really.

230
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:37,313
Now, come here. Give me a hug.

231
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,235
Gordon?

232
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:57,870
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know. We're going to be okay.

233
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,919
How can you say that?
These people are crazy.

234
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:05,992
They're probably scared too.

235
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,630
- They're going to kill us.
- We don't know that.

236
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,236
They haven't killed us yet, right?

237
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,472
That's only because they need us.

238
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,394
What's going to happen
when they don't need us any more?

239
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,312
They'll probably let us go.

240
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,758
<i>Here are your categories.</i>

00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:40,478

249

No, Cocoa Puffs and Fruit Loops,
that's cereal. This shit is for horses!

250
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,878
- Why do you have to make so much noise?
- Sorry I woke you up.

251
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:24,272
But we've got to do something about
the food situation here.

252
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:28,911
- I can't live on oats and prosciutto.
- We're going to stop for supplies.

255
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,994
What do you say? Who's Herod?

256
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,834
- I'll go with that.
- I don't think so. How about Saul?

It's registered to Freeley.
They grabbed another ride.

261
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,192
They're not walking.
Cancel the APB on the car.

262
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,148
Marcus left us a note.
He must have been in a hurry.

263
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,554
Hostages explains
why he's still with them.

264
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,598
Keep the APB on the four of them.

265
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,550
Gentlemen! We are now looking for an RV.
Utah license plate unknown.

266
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:23,234
Let's go find it!

267
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,395
What're you doing?

268
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,279
My mother loves these things.

269
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,671
Sweepstakes are for losers.

270
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,799
Believe it or not.
I know this mechanic who won five grand.

271
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:52,557
I know a fella who won twice in a week.
What are the odds of that?

272
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,349
- Here? In this very store?
- I was here working at the time.

273
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,273
- We took a picture.
- That's cool, man.

274
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,715
I play every day. Never won a thing.

275
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,634
Dispatch. I'm 1086 at the Tri-Mart.
Back in fifteen.

276
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,512
<i>All-points for RV.</i>
<i>Utah license plate unknown.</i>

277
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:22,674
I think you need a system.
A birthday or a woman's measurements.

278
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,751
- Hey, Rob.
- Curtis!

279
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,111
Good morning.

280
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,116
Come on, Marcus. We should go.

281
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,236
Was that all?

282
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,998
- Thanks a lot.
- You bet. Good luck to you.

283
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,311
Advil.

284
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,232
Just a minute.

285
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,068
You can't win unless you enter.

286
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,790
Have a good day, boys.

287
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,838
- Thanks.
- You have a good day too.

288
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,108
- Did you get it?
- Yeah, I got it.

289
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,790
- I don't feel good about it, though.
- You're making too big a deal about it.

290
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,191
I just feel like
I'm going behind my boy's back.

291
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:34,590
I'm not with that.

292
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,275
I just think he should be
more involved in this.

293
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:41,671
He will be. I just want to know first.

294
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,756
Thank you.

295
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:19,592
- The whole thing's illogical.
- How's that illogical?

296
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,839
If Yogi took the picnic basket outside
the park, Ranger Rick couldn't do shit.

297
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,039
- How can you eat that shit, Marcus?
- Who are you? The nutrition police?

298
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,236
Like that breakfast taco is better.

299
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,951
- It's better than that rat shit.
- Because the word "breakfast" is in it?

300
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,274
Do you know how much saturated fat,
cholesterol and sodium are in that?

301
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,910
- No.
- About twice the daily allowance.

302
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:53,393
So, nutritionally, you shouldn't eat
until the day after tomorrow.

303
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:56,120
How can they advertise it as healthy?

304
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,239
That's nothing. You'd be surprised at
what some restaurants do.

305
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,312
Me and some buddies went out
to get some food.

306
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:07,314
An hour later, my boy's ass
is glued to the toilet stool.

307
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,995
Sick doesn't describe what was going on.

308
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:15,995
I've seen it with my own eyes.
The boy was changing colours.

309
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,594
He was dark-skinned, right?

310
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,832
After half an hour,
he looked like a white.

311
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:27,430
The next day, the health department
closes the place down.

312
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,398
The meat didn't come from a cow.

313
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,275
- Where did it come from?
- Dog.

314
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,032
All kinds of dog. Dog with broccoli.

315
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,791
Poodles with black bean-sauce.
Crispy barbecue dog.

316
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,592
That's sick. Imagine your dog is missing
and you go out to dinner and eat it.

317
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,594
That's a cold world out there.

318
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,957
You don't know what you're eating.

319
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,352
Fuck! Shit!

320
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,593
Curtis, we're being pulled over.
Addy, take everybody in the back.

321
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,392
Donna, come here.

322
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,870
You're in the back with us.
What goes down now is up to you.

325

Please exit the vehicle
with your license and registration.

326
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:00,792

- May we search your vehicle?

327
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,632
Yeah.

328
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:05,917
May I see your license and registration?

329
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,320
- Where are you coming from?
- Clear Lake.

330
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,550
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

331
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:31,473
- It's registered to a Gordon Jacobson.
- That's my boyfriend.

332
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:35,155
- Where is Mr Jacobson now?
- He's up at the lake.

333
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,954
Are you all right?

334
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,112
Yeah. We had an argument this morning.

335
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,313
Vehicle's empty.

336
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:09,519
Here's your papers.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

337
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,953
Gordon?

338
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:51,550
What if he had looked on the roof?
Would you have shot him?

339
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:55,349
- In a minute.
- How can you be so nonchalant?

340
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:59,752
It's a game. Everybody who plays
the game understands the rules.

341
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,152
I certainly understand the rules.
The cop's the good guy. I'm the bad guy.

342
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,788
It's his job to catch me.

343
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,599
I will do everything I have to
to stay ahead.

344
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,309
I've been to prison. I'm not going back.

345
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,948
Nobody's fucking with my liberty again.

346
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,112
When you get to the trees,
get off this road.

347
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:23,398
- Don't you think we should keep moving?
- No, we should hold up until morning.

348
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,755
Then we'll get a new ride.

349
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,916
Another night with the Bobbsey twins.

350
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,871
Gordon and Donna.
What made you buy a mobile home?

351
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,270
My grandfather left it to me.

352
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,718
Thought I'd take some vacation time.
Drive around the countryside.

353
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,270
- Kind of a Charles Kurault thing.
- Who's Charles Kurault?

354
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,750
He's a reporter on television.

355
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,074
I don't watch TV.

356
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,234
You should watch TV. Then you'd know
you can't read people's minds.

357
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,551
- That's funny.
- Don't you think we would know by now?

358
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,438
Absolutely not.

359
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,513
The government puts people
with supernatural powers on an island.

360
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,831
I'm serious. If I was a politician, -

361
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,549
- the last thing I'd want
is some fucker who could read minds.

362
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,233
Gordon gets it.

363
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,188
So the people just go away
and never come back?

364
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,036
First, they want to see you.
Make sure you've got the real goods.

365
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,077
Then your ass is theirs.

366
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:38,038
Then they take your car
and stick a bomb in it.

367
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,839
Everybody you knew thinks you're dead.

368
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,072
But you're not.
You're on vacation at Club Fed.

369
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,118
When they say they want to
talk to you, are they lying?

370
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,033
Of course they're lying.

371
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:54,034
If you can read minds,
why don't you know that?

372
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,432
She's quite the smart-ass.

373
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,150
My girl.

374
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,678
- Gordon's not getting any tonight.
- She's pissed.

375
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,910
Go get her, cowboy.

376
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,993
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

377
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:33,076
- We were just kidding around.
- Don't you get it?

378
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:37,279
They'll tell you a joke one minute,
the next, they'll shoot you in the head.

379
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,398
They're not waving guns at us any more.

380
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,632
Maybe if they get to know us,
they don't kill us.

381
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,076
Gordon?

382
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,471
Is it possible
that you admire these people?

383
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,517
Not admire...

384
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,869
They're going to make more this week
than I'll make all year.

385
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,951
I can't believe you're saying this.

386
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:02,875
A week ago, you wouldn't have had
anything to do with people like this.

387
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:07,189
- I know what I'm doing.
- You don't have a clue.

388
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,830
That's enough!
Let's go back and join the others.

389
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,914
I'll be back in a minute.

390
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:31,751
- I'm going to bed.
- Me too.

391
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,994
- Good night, Ray.
- Sweet dreams.

392
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,393
I'm going to get another beer.
Marcus, you want a beer?

393
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,878
Yeah, just get me one.

394
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,600
- Gordo?
- Fine.

395
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,709
What the fuck are you doing?
You think this is cool?

396
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,233
No.

397
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:08,029
- Why are you kissing everybody's ass?
- I'm not.

398
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,636
People like you look at this life -

399
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:16,476
- and you think it's got a power,
because it says "fuck you".

400
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:22,634
There's an invisible line
between this world and yours, Gordon.

401
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,917
But you can't see that
until you cross over that line.

402
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,911
And once you do -

403
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,834
- there's no turning back.

404
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,351
Sorry, man.

405
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:08,795
Yo, dog. I'm going to take
this couple for a walk.

406
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,635
I don't give a shit.
I'm going to go take a piss.

407
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,636
Come with me.

408
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,394
Just shut up and come with me.

409
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,197
Give me a kiss.

410
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,109
That's all I get.

411
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:58,392
We're not giving you any trouble.
Why are you taking us out here?

412
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,635
Shut the fuck up and listen to me.
Do everything I tell you to do.

413
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,472
- Shouldn't we be with the others?
- Shut up!

414
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,712
We're over here!

415
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:34,032
What the fuck are you doing out here?

416
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:38,113
Getting some rest.
It's a fucking rest stop, isn't it?

417
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,078
We've got to go. Gordon, Donna, now!

418
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,231
Let's go, honey.

419
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:01,511
I think we found ourselves a new ride.

420
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,638
- Nice car.
- Thanks.

421
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,759
Give me the keys! Get down!

422
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,195
- We don't need to kill him.
- Says who?

423
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,874
This isn't what we're about.

424
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,237
- He's going to tell the cops.
- Tie him up and put him in the RV.

425
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:23,437
You want to be bad guys
but not kill anybody.

426
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:26,273
You'd better
re-examine your commitment.

427
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,432
Shut the fuck up! No more killing!

428
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,955
Put him in the RV!

429
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,875
There you go. All yours.

430
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:42,830
- It's the right thing to do.
- You getting a conscience, Marcus?

431
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,037
You've got one too.
You just don't want to admit it.

432
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,270
Just get him in the RV.

433
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:02,232
Police found the motor home
at a rest stop.

434
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,834
They took some guy's suburban.

435
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,275
- Did he identify them as our guys?
- Yes.

436
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,192
Let's get down there.

437
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,150
Hey, Gordo. Behave and I'll teach you
the finer points of armed robbery.

438
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:26,678
You'll never feel power like saying:
"Give me everything you've got!"

439
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:40,596
- We've got a cop.
- Shit.

440
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,357
- Come on, Ray! Move!
- Shut up! Just shut up!

441
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,875
- Just be cool.
- Don't tell me to be cool!

442
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,793
Dispatch 323. Code 33.

443
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,157
Suspect vehicle: red and white suburban.

444
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,788
- What's he doing?
- Curtis, be cool.

445
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,319
- Try to lose him.
- Pull over!

446
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,789
Son of a bitch.

447
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:10,315
What the hell are you doing?

448
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,232
Come on! Move!

449
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,071
Watch out!

450
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,550
Shit!

451
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:41,915
<i>402, I'm in pursuit.</i>
<i>They're coming right at you.</i>

452
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,550
- Get in the room!
- What's going on?

453
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,198
Knock him out!

454
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,240
Come on, Ray. Hurry up.

455
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,038
Gordon, you drive.

456
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,159
Come on. Get in there, Donna.

457
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,195
Get down! Duck!

458
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,912
Go! Go!

459
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,720
Car 401, do you see them?

460
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:23,552
Shit!

461
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,959
Are you sure taking Curtis into Vago's
is a good idea?

462
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,079
Yeah, why?

463
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:14,869
How do you know he won't kill him
the second he sees him?

464
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:18,157
Curtis does what I tell him to do.

465
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:23,189
Asking Curtis not to kill the guy that
killed his best friend is asking a lot.

466
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:29,394
Not even Curtis is dumb enough
to throw down on Tony Vago.

467
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:32,552
Curtis takes the cake on dumb, Ray.

468
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,631
Here you go.

469
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,036
Thanks a lot.

470
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,274
- You're going to be cool, right?
- I'm going to be cool.

471
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,830
It might be better if I stayed here
and watched these two.

472
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,150
Addy'll be fine.

473
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,471
- You afraid?
- Damn right! These are bad people.

474
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,030
- I'm not afraid.
- You're too stupid to be scared.

475
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,953
No reason to be scared.
We'll move the weight.

476
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:37,997
We'll get out.

477
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:42,997
Hurry back.

478
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:28,554
Your intelligence really shines.

479
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:32,554
Every cop in the world is looking
for you and you lead them to me.

480
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,315
That is brilliant.
Obviously, there's no respect.

481
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,951
But your types wouldn't know
anything about respect, would you?

482
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:46,752
Respect is the foundation of
civilization and working relationships.

483
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:51,038
No offence, Tony, but you're getting
a little carried away.

484
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:56,598
Respect is what separates us from
the niggers and the spics.

485
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,753
When I first met you,
you had intelligence and connections.

486
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:06,232
You had potential. So what do you do?

487
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,075
You get mixed up
with this second-rate stick-up man.

488
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,800
Tony, we just came to do a deal.

489
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:21,278
What are you selling?

490
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,078
Look, man...

491
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,150
Come on, Tony.

492
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,156
It's taking them a long time.

493
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:40,792
- How stupid do you think I am?
- I don't know what you're thinking.

494
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,953
- We just came here to do a deal.
- Deal?!

495
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,989
I've got thirty keys of primo stuff.
Over a million in street value.

496
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,390
You can have it for half.

497
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:56,597
- How do you know me?
- I met you through Eddie Grillo.

498
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:00,275
- Correct. And how did I know him?
- You guys did business.

499
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,035
- Correct. What kind of business?
- You bought from him.

500
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:05,918
Incorrect!

501
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,878
Eddie Grillo worked for me!

502
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:14,795
These drugs belong to me!
Do you think I'm going to pay you?

503
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,478
Do you think you could come in here,
you son of a bitch, and rip me off?!

504
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:24,235
- No. I didn't know it was yours.
- Jesus Christ.

505
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,109
It doesn't matter what you knew!
What matters is how it looks!

506
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,590
And it looks like you stole from me!

507
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:37,119
Can you give me a break here?

508
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:42,119
- Please, Tony.
- Sorry, kid.

509
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:47,718
We would never have taken this shit
if we'd known it was yours.

510
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,758
We've got all of it right here.

511
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,480
We'd never have taken
these drugs from you.

512
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,676
We've got everything right here.

513
00:53:55,840 --> 00:53:58,229
I can't die like this.

514
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,999
What the fuck are you doing?

515
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,597
This is 10, 15 grand. Where's the rest?
Where's the rest?

516
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:12,469
Was I disrespectful, Tony?
Where the fuck is the rest, Tony?

517
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,154
- Where's the rest?
- He's fucking lying!

518
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,438
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Cue Tip was my best friend, fucker.

519
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:21,830
Come on, Curtis.

520
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,668
- How did it go?
- Get in the car.

521
00:54:47,840 --> 00:54:49,592
What happened, Curtis?

522
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:58,989
You killed Tony Vago, Raymond?

523
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:03,278
Eddie worked for Vago.
He wanted to kill us in there.

524
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,512
- Would that make you happy?
- No.

525
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,394
I thought you knew what you were doing.

526
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:20,077
Massacre in Vegas. Five dead.
One of them was Tony Vago.

527
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:24,870
- He had half his face burned off.
- And the reason you're telling me this?

528
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:28,874
Witnesses' descriptions match our guys.
They're driving a Dodge.

529
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:33,477
Call Richard Pearson at the FBI.
Tell him we'll be there in the morning.

530
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:55,070
- May I have your attention?
- Who the hell are you?

531
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,390
Who I am is of no importance.

532
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,872
I have been sent here
by Mr Giannino and his associates -

533
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,999
- to deal with the situation
that occurred here last evening.

534
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:09,516
- We worked for Mr Vago.
- Mr Vago worked for Mr Giannino.

535
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:12,592
- So? What do we call you?
- Sir.

536
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:16,359
You may call me sir.

537
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:25,230
<i>That high pressure continues</i>
<i>giving us dry days and chilly nights.</i>

538
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:45,917
- Raymond? What are you doing here?
- Nice to see you too, Wayne.

539
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:59,350
Shit.

540
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:32,193
Curtis!

541
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,952
I'm sorry I had to come here.
I had no choice.

542
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,588
What happened? This isn't your style.

543
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:09,878
I don't know.

544
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,556
Curtis went crazy in Grillo's office.
Nobody was supposed to be there.

545
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,598
You should never have hooked up
with that asshole.

546
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,594
I don't need a fucking lecture, Wayne.

547
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:24,638
- I need your help.
- I'm not getting involved.

548
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,397
- Remember Cecil in New Mexico?
- I'm not getting involved in this shit.

549
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,870
If anyone saw you,
my parole is down the toilet.

550
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:36,395
Nobody saw anything.

551
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:39,552
I need you to make
one phone call for me.

552
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,870
Can you do that?

553
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:47,872
All right, Ray.
One phone call. That's it.

554
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:59,949
- Can I trust this guy?
- How should I know?

555
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,317
You thought you could trust Vago.

556
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:19,873
The price is the price.

557
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:24,431
I'll call you tomorrow and tell you
where we're going to meet.

558
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,031
Just make this deal and go.

559
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,875
You hit Tony Vago.
They'll never stop looking for you.

560
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,232
- What are you doing?
- Going to my girlfriend's.

561
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:45,551
If anyone saw you,
I'll tell the cops you broke in.

562
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:49,269
- I want you guys gone by tonight.
- Okay, Wayne.

563
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:53,476
Hey, Wayne? I need your car.

564
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:58,875
This is fucking unbelievable, man!
You come and take over my house, -

565
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:03,192
- use my car...
You want to come and fuck my girlfriend?

566
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,159
Thanks a lot.

567
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,634
What do you think Vago's people will do?

568
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:32,598
They don't shit
without permission from Giannino.

569
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:38,916
Giannino's big on vendettas.
There's no way he'll sit still for this.

570
01:00:39,080 --> 01:00:42,277
- If they find them first...
- We'll pick up body parts.

571
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:46,399
Can you get me surveillance
on Giannino's shooters?

572
01:00:51,800 --> 01:00:54,234
Are you still mad at me?

573
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,589
Yeah.

574
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:03,350
Why?

575
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:12,677
Because you knew that Vago killed
Curtis' best friend, -

576
01:01:12,840 --> 01:01:16,719
- and you still took that lunatic
in there with you.

577
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,268
I know it was stupid.

578
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:29,593
But it turned out lucky.

579
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:37,757
It's not enough we've got
every cop in the country looking for us.

580
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:44,758
Now we have the mob after us too.
We're just blessed with good fortune.

581
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:51,790
I'm sorry, Addy.

582
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,196
Right now, sorry isn't good enough.

583
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:37,474
<i>With the lioness out of the way,</i>
<i>the hyenas bring the wildebeest down.</i>

584
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,355
Do you like guns?

585
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,435
I've been to the firing range a lot,
but I've never seen one like that.

586
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,591
Sig 9 millimetre.

587
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:02,992
You get hit with that puppy,
you'd be lucky only to lose a limb.

588
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:19,876
At the rest stop, you were trying to
get us away, weren't you?

589
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,595
When this whole thing started,
I was so scared.

590
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,754
Now I just feel numb.

591
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:36,514
If you need to be scared, you should
be scared about your boyfriend.

592
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,232
Put it down, Gordon!

593
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:49,437
Jesus Christ. It's cool.

594
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,795
It's not even loaded.

595
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:55,475
You know how close you came
to getting killed?

596
01:03:56,640 --> 01:04:00,713
You two morons get ready.
We're going to make a food run.

597
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:04,513
Pack up. I'm going for food.

598
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:11,755
Marcus. Help me load up the stuff.

599
01:04:19,160 --> 01:04:21,515
What?

600
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:28,351
You have a problem because I'm
listening to Curtis' point of view?

601
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:31,353
His point of view?

602
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:36,071
What point of view? He is psychotic.
Would you please stop imitating him?

603
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,789
I'm not imitating him.
I don't condone what they're doing.

604
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:44,476
I'm just trying to understand
why it is they do it.

605
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:49,430
- What's happening to you?
- This is a game.

606
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,592
Everyone who plays the game
knows the rules.

607
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,318
The cops are the good guys.

608
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:58,951
The good guys' job is to catch them.
The bad guys' job is to not get caught.

609
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:05,549
- Just get away from me, please.
- We have to get something to eat.

610
01:05:27,800 --> 01:05:30,314
Where are you going, Donna?

611
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,755
To take a bath.

612
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:47,672
- A shot of Scotch.
- Coming up, darling.

613
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:53,397
- How much further to where we're going?
- Why?

614
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:55,869
- Just curious.
- Stay curious.

615
01:05:56,040 --> 01:06:00,431
- I don't know about Mexico.
- You'll have a good time.

616
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:05,594
- It's easy for you. You've got Addy.
- You'll meet somebody.

617
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:10,311
Addy knows people.
She's got a friend down there, some guy.

618
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:15,190
He knows some chick named Juanita.
Addy says she's going to introduce you.

619
01:06:15,360 --> 01:06:18,432
- I don't get set up.
- What are you talking about?

620
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:21,990
- About getting set up. I'm not with it.
- Why not?

621
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,755
- What did Addy say about this girl?
- She said she was very sweet.

622
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:31,154
- Nice personality, right?
- She has a terrific personality.

623
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:34,551
- What does she look like?
- What difference does it make?

624
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:38,599
- Go right in there. Forget about it.
- No, I don't even walk that way.

625
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:43,117
Every time somebody tells me about
a girl's personality before her looks, -

626
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:45,032
- I know she'll be butt-ugly.

627
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,272
- How do you know that?
- I've been through it.

628
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:54,675
Three months ago, my cousin set me up.
This girl's supposed to have a big ass.

629
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,478
So I'm like cool.

630
01:06:56,640 --> 01:07:00,235
An hour later, I'm at the Beef Basket.

631
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:03,949
I kick back, you know,
in a booth. Chilling.

632
01:07:04,120 --> 01:07:09,114
And in walks the butt-ugliest woman
I've ever seen in my life.

633
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:13,034
She walks over to the table and smiles.
The bitch has five teeth.

634
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,395
- That's cold.
- Brutal.

635
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:18,870
You know what she orders? Ribs.

636
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,396
The bitch has five teeth
and she's chewing on a rib.

637
01:07:22,560 --> 01:07:25,996
Chewing's not even the right word.
The bitch was gumming it!

638
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:30,597
That's when I just said:
"Fuck it. I've had enough of this.

639
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:35,151
I'm not spending
one more minute with this ugly, -

640
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:38,756
- sabre-toothed-tiger-looking,
gum-smacking bitch."

641
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:42,390
So I got up, went to the bathroom,
climbed out the window -

642
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:44,630
- and booked to the pad.

643
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:48,918
So when Addy's talking about
hooking me up with some great girl, -

644
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:55,235
- there's no way in the fucking world
that's going to happen to the dog.

645
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,432
She could've been a wonderful girl
with a fantastic personality.

646
01:08:01,600 --> 01:08:03,750
Yeah, right.

647
01:08:10,880 --> 01:08:14,668
- You eat a lot of that stuff.
- I'm pregnant.

648
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:19,796
- How long have you known?
- A couple of days.

649
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:23,637
- Raymond know?
- No.

650
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:27,315
- You're not going to tell him?
- Yeah, I'll tell him.

651
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:29,598
When?

652
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:33,436
When the time is right.
He's got too much on his mind.

653
01:08:34,480 --> 01:08:37,153
You should give him a chance
to think about it.

654
01:08:37,320 --> 01:08:41,598
- We'll go to Mexico and live there.
- That's a dream, Addy.

655
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,754
That's real.

656
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:50,629
If Raymond says we'll do that,
that's what we'll do.

657
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,509
Go to Mexico, buy a house by the ocean
and be a family.

658
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,876
What about you and Gordon?
Do you love him?

659
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:05,516
You think you know someone, -

660
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:10,196
- that there might be
something to build on...

661
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:13,875
Then you see a side of him
you never knew existed.

662
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,671
Howdy, Tex.

663
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:29,797
- What's your problem, man?
- Right now it's you.

664
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,599
- You bumped into me.
- We don't have time for this.

665
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:35,115
We've got time.

666
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:41,548
Come on, Gordon. Kick his ass!

667
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,950
Shit.

668
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:46,031
That's enough, Curtis. End it.

669
01:09:46,200 --> 01:09:48,589
I've got it.

670
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:53,515
Jesus Christ, Gordon!

671
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,113
Get the fuck back to the car!

672
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:01,878
- I need a doctor.
- No, you don't.

673
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:12,799
- Is he dead?
- Yes. Move! Get in the car!

674
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:30,637
Jesus, that was the most insane move
I've ever seen.

675
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,792
You killed a guy over some pizza?

676
01:10:33,960 --> 01:10:38,397
How does it feel, Gordon?
To throw your life down the toilet.

677
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,472
- It was self-defence.
- That's not self-defence.

678
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:47,875
Self-defence is: I hit you, you hit me.
Not: I hit you, you kill me!

679
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,039
Idiot. Fucking idiot.

680
01:11:02,720 --> 01:11:05,598
- What happened?
- Gordon killed somebody.

681
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,115
Get some ice. We're in a rush.

682
01:11:08,280 --> 01:11:12,353
You're supposed to be the leader.
You can't even control Gordon now.

683
01:11:14,480 --> 01:11:16,835
Gordon?

684
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:21,630
It happened so fast.
Would you just get some ice, please?

685
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,959
Hello.
I hope we didn't frighten you, Wayne.

686
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,998
- It <i>is</i> Wayne, isn't it?
- Who the hell are you?

687
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:03,395
I love that look.
No matter how often I do this.

688
01:13:03,560 --> 01:13:07,269
That "I'm-in-deep-doo-doo-now" look.

689
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,320
- What do you want?
- To the point. Good.

690
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:15,793
It saves everybody time and energy.
I just want to know where Raymond went.

691
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,951
Raymond who?

692
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:22,559
You were doing so well up till now.

693
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:26,156
You were direct, to the point,
made eye contact.

694
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,153
- Do I look stupid to you, Wayne?
- No.

695
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:32,437
Then you must know that I refer to
Mr Raymond Lembecke.

696
01:13:32,600 --> 01:13:36,354
Your former cell mate. The gentleman
who was here earlier today.

697
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,159
I spent last night with my girlfriend.

698
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:42,949
Somebody broke in through my window.
I don't know who it...

699
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,838
Just a minute.

700
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,754
You spent the night at your girlfriend's
and you're just coming home?

701
01:13:48,920 --> 01:13:53,357
Then how did you know
that someone broke into your house?

702
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:57,559
- I saw the broken glass.
- Look at me.

703
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:02,591
You're lying. You know you're lying.

704
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,320
I know you're lying.
They know you're lying.

705
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,597
I haven't seen Raymond
since I got out of prison.

706
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:15,311
I always give a man a decent chance.
Usually it's three wrong answers.

707
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,429
If you make a guy tell you
what you want to know right away, -

708
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,875
- it robs him of his dignity.

709
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,508
He feels he didn't even try
to be a stand-up guy.

710
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:29,151
- I'm telling you that I haven't...
- You're telling me nothing.

711
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:32,710
But you will tell me
what I want to know.

712
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:38,637
I only mention it, because everybody
tells me what I want to know eventually.

713
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,115
Please sit down, Wayne.

714
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,033
I say again, take a seat.

715
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:03,798
Where are we going, Ray?

716
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:07,032
I'm going to do the deal
at my brother's house.

717
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:09,634
He's away in Canada.

718
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:46,917
You're doing very well, son.
Now, where in New Mexico?

719
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:52,039
- Where in New Mexico?
- I swear to God, I don't know!

720
01:15:53,560 --> 01:15:56,313
He just said New Mexico.

721
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,117
Wayne, stay with me, son.

722
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:06,070
Raymond was raised in New Mexico,
wasn't he?

723
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:09,952
And he still has family there?

724
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:14,590
He has a brother.
I don't know where he lives.

725
01:16:17,120 --> 01:16:19,634
Thank you very much, son.

726
01:17:13,120 --> 01:17:15,350
I'll be in in a minute, okay?

727
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:32,754
I no longer care what happens to me.

728
01:17:32,920 --> 01:17:37,391
I just don't want anything
to happen to Donna, all right?

729
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:14,078
What's so funny?

730
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:18,119
Old Gordon over there
just sitting there all teary-eyed.

731
01:18:18,280 --> 01:18:20,919
The fool's never
killed anybody before.

732
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,755
- He still hasn't.
- What are you talking about?

733
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,591
That guy in the parking lot...

734
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:31,911
He wasn't dead.
He was just hurt real bad.

735
01:18:33,160 --> 01:18:35,754
I had to finish him off.

736
01:18:46,280 --> 01:18:49,238
My whole life I've been afraid.

737
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:53,234
Now tonight...

738
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,231
I tell myself it was self-defence.

739
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:02,750
It wasn't.

740
01:19:02,920 --> 01:19:07,914
I could've walked away
before it started. But I didn't.

741
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,637
I just wanted them to know
that I wasn't afraid.

742
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:23,952
I wanted to impress them.

743
01:19:56,960 --> 01:19:59,474
I love you, Raymond.

744
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:19,110
If I ever thought
that it could get this bad, I mean...

745
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:24,308
- I didn't mean it to get this crazy.
- I know. It's okay.

746
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:30,677
- I love you.
- I love you too.

747
01:20:31,680 --> 01:20:35,753
- Forever?
- I love you more than forever.

748
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:40,514
Forever'll be done and I'll love you.

749
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:45,354
You know...
we've been together for a long time.

750
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:48,876
And us going to Mexico...

751
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,909
That's kind of like saying we'll spend
the rest of our lives together.

752
01:20:54,080 --> 01:20:56,719
Once we get down to Mexico...

753
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,519
...you know, maybe we should...

754
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:01,557
What?

755
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,439
Once we're there, if you want...

756
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:07,714
Are you asking me to marry you?

757
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,358
- Yes.
- Really?

758
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,673
What do you say?

759
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:18,035
I say yes.

760
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:40,398
<i>They're at the brother's house.</i>

761
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,596
Thank you.

762
01:22:23,640 --> 01:22:25,790
- Yeah, Thompson.
- It's Marcus.

763
01:22:25,960 --> 01:22:29,999
- Marcus? Where are you?
<i>- At Raymond's brother's house.</i>

764
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:34,631
Outside of Truth or Consequences,
about three miles south on highway 25.

765
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,950
- Are the hostages with you?
- Yes.

766
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,274
- It'd be better if you can get away.
- No, I won't abandon these hostages.

767
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:45,591
Just make sure
your people don't kill us.

768
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:49,309
Yo, man, just take care of that for me!

769
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:54,589
- What are you doing?
- I made a phone call.

770
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:57,595
- To who?
- To my boy.

771
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,354
- At 4:45 in the morning?
- He works graveyard.

772
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:05,600
What did you call him for?

773
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:10,914
- You ask a lot of questions, Raymond.
- You're not answering any.

774
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:22,199
I called him to make sure
everything was okay with my mother.

775
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:27,875
She's on welfare. I've not exactly
been in a position to check up on her.

776
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:33,796
- Why didn't you call her?
- First of all, she's sleeping.

777
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,919
Second, even if something <i>was</i> wrong,
she wouldn't tell me.

778
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:42,232
She wouldn't tell me.
She's like that. She's proud.

779
01:23:43,080 --> 01:23:45,435
I get it.

780
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:49,236
Call your friend back. Call him back!

781
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:53,237
When he answers,
all you've got to do is tell him:

782
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:57,188
"I just want to make sure
you understood what I said."

783
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:06,876
Let me listen.

784
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:13,475
- Frankie, it's Marcus.
<i>- Did you fucking forget something?</i>

785
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,279
Did you understand what I told you?

786
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:20,069
<i>- What do you think I am? Stupid?</i>
- I just wanted to make sure.

787
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:25,075
<i>I'll go check on your mom in a while.</i>
<i>Mind if I put on a shirt first?</i>

788
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,073
- Thanks, man.
<i>- Yeah, later.</i>

789
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:37,356
I'm sorry, man.

790
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:43,228
Everything's fucked up.

791
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,274
We've got them. Assemble the team.

792
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,356
Wake up. We've got to go.

793
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,557
- Go where?
- Mexico, but we've got to go now.

794
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:37,999
- But we've got to do the deal.
- Fuck the deal. I'm thinking of us.

795
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:41,789
- There's more to think of than us.
- The others can do what they want.

796
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:44,394
I'm pregnant, Ray.

797
01:26:45,240 --> 01:26:49,836
- What are you talking about?
- You're going to be a daddy.

798
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:52,798
Why didn't you tell me before?

799
01:26:53,960 --> 01:26:57,396
I just didn't want you to think
you had to marry me.

800
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:00,438
Think I had to marry you?

801
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:04,149
I wanted to marry you
the first time I saw you.

802
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,753
Come on. We've got to go.

803
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:45,751
Look at this piece of shit.
I found him hiding.

804
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:50,596
Get him in the house, Curtis.
Addy, load the car.

805
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,716
Get in there.

806
01:27:57,480 --> 01:28:00,995
- What's going on?
- Shut up. Listen to me.

807
01:28:02,120 --> 01:28:05,715
Something's going to go down here,
but help is on the way.

808
01:28:05,880 --> 01:28:11,113
If anything happens before help arrives,
you grab Donna and get her out of here.

809
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:14,795
I'm a drug enforcement agent.
You never killed that guy.

810
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:18,953
When Curtis went over to him,
he was still alive.

811
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,716
- Why didn't you tell us before?
- I couldn't trust you. Just stay down.

812
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,911
Hurry up, Addy.

813
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,632
- Just do the deal, Ray.
- I'm going to do the deal.

814
01:29:01,240 --> 01:29:03,674
You Raymond Lembecke?

815
01:29:04,560 --> 01:29:08,633
- That's right.
- I'm Cecil. What have you got?

816
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:11,229
Come inside.

817
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:27,512
You don't know who you're fucking with.

818
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:30,436
Shut up.

819
01:29:35,280 --> 01:29:37,635
That looks like it hurts.

820
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,348
This is my lucky quarter.

821
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:47,396
You'd better get one of these.

822
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:52,478
You don't look that lucky.

823
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:06,313
- We're going to have to test it.
- Take one.

824
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,395
- You seem a little too nervous, man.
- I'm in a hurry.

825
01:30:58,080 --> 01:31:00,116
It's good.

826
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:08,713
You're a rich man now.
What're you going to do?

827
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,269
None of your business.

828
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:23,798
Jesus Christ, look at that!

829
01:31:28,720 --> 01:31:29,789
Shit!

830
01:31:43,520 --> 01:31:45,112
Come on!

831
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,353
Drop the weapon!

832
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:36,156
Go. Stay low.

833
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,353
Gordon, Donna, follow me!

834
01:32:44,520 --> 01:32:46,590
Come on, honey!

835
01:32:59,360 --> 01:33:01,078
We'll be okay.

836
01:33:04,040 --> 01:33:05,951
It's going to be all right.

837
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,472
Stay down.

838
01:33:32,520 --> 01:33:34,431
Gordon! Get down!

839
01:33:53,800 --> 01:33:55,950
Gordon!

840
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:08,031
- No, I'm not one of them.
- I know.

841
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,792
- Please don't.
- Close your eyes.

842
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,476
Snipers! Verify your targets!

843
01:34:58,640 --> 01:35:00,392
Target verified.

844
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:02,357
Go, go, go, now!

845
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:12,471
Give me the gun, Addy.

846
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,835
Give me the gun.

847
01:35:20,960 --> 01:35:23,030
Oh, honey...

848
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:36,470
Come on.

849
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:42,830
You're okay.

850
01:35:50,800 --> 01:35:53,109
Hold your fire!

851
01:35:56,720 --> 01:35:59,234
It's going to be okay.

852
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:02,156
On me!

853
01:36:10,120 --> 01:36:11,997
Raymond!

854
01:36:14,920 --> 01:36:17,275
Raymond, stop!

855
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:21,432
Stop, goddamn it! Drop it!

856
01:36:23,000 --> 01:36:25,912
I'm a drug enforcement agent!

857
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:40,874
- I just want to be alone with Addy.
- It's over, man.

858
01:42:28,200 --> 01:42:29,792
