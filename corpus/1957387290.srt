1
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:10,144
- [Announcer] It's
"Elvira's 40th Anniversary,

2
00:00:10,144 --> 00:00:13,747
Very Scary, Very
Special Special.

3
00:00:14,882 --> 00:00:18,352
Especially For You",
(laughs evilly)

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,456
featuring four
special screenings

5
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:25,659
chosen by Elvira's cat
and a guy named Jimmy,

6
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:29,397
"House on Haunted Hill",
"City of the Dead",

7
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:34,402
"Messiah of Evil", and
"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark".

8
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:38,639
Ready or not, here they come.

9
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,109
Up here, arise, arrive!

10
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:46,347
- Hello, darling.
- Advance, alight.

11
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,183
- It's me, welcome to-
- Attack!

12
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:51,152
- Okay, okay, already.

13
00:00:51,152 --> 00:00:53,287
Stop, they got it.

14
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,923
Oh, if I had a nickel

15
00:00:55,923 --> 00:00:58,792
for every time I had
to tell a man shut up.

16
00:00:58,792 --> 00:00:59,993
Hello, darling.

17
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:02,263
It's me, Elvira,
Mistress of the Dark,

18
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:04,732
the dame who scored
the cleavage award.

19
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,835
My cups runneth over,
and you're never bored.

20
00:01:07,835 --> 00:01:11,339
Oh, and welcome to
my "40th Anniversary,

21
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:14,242
Very Scary, Very
Special Special",

22
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:19,247
the specialist special I've
ever done, especially for you.

23
00:01:20,348 --> 00:01:24,952
I put the spesh in
special, IRL, girl, ow!

24
00:01:24,952 --> 00:01:26,487
Oh, okay.

25
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:31,024
So, get out the shackles and
hang onto your broomsticks,

26
00:01:31,024 --> 00:01:34,628
'cause this is a momentous,
once in a lifetime occasion.

27
00:01:34,628 --> 00:01:36,964
I know time flies, doesn't it?

28
00:01:36,964 --> 00:01:38,832
Especially in show business,

29
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,435
but as unbelievable as it seems,

30
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,172
tonight, I am turning 40.

31
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:47,508
We're did the time to go?

32
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:52,480
Why, I don't feel a
day older than undead.

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,415
Oh, look at me.

34
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,750
Oh, what a cutie.

35
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,951
Cute as a little piranha.

36
00:01:59,086 --> 00:02:01,589
At that age, pageants
were all we had.

37
00:02:01,589 --> 00:02:03,791
You know, I had to put myself
through nursery school.

38
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,627
Oh, and I just loved
my makeup artist.

39
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,430
She always had a
teething ring with her.

40
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,964
She'd still be working, too,

41
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,301
if it wasn't that she was
abducted by those aliens.

42
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,436
But that's my next show,

43
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:20,441
"Elvira Undercover,
Extra and Terrestrial".

44
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,578
(sighs) You know, I
hate to sound redundant,

45
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:26,580
and if you don't know
what that word means,

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,216
you're in the right place,

47
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:31,252
but this evening,
I do feel special.

48
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:34,488
Or maybe that's
just indigestion,

49
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,390
but while I was lying here,

50
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,792
stuffed into this torture
chamber of a dress,

51
00:02:38,792 --> 00:02:40,328
trying to breathe,

52
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:43,864
I realized something really
special about this special,

53
00:02:43,864 --> 00:02:45,933
and that's my guest stars.

54
00:02:45,933 --> 00:02:49,337
We have Vincent Price,
Christopher Lee,

55
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,973
Patricia Jessel, Jeff Conaway,

56
00:02:52,973 --> 00:02:57,945
Elijah Cook, Jr., Joy
Bang, and Sammy Davis, Jr.

57
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,880
Holla!

58
00:03:01,282 --> 00:03:03,584
Now, if those names don't
mean anything to you,

59
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:06,854
it's probably
'cause they're dead,

60
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,856
well, all except for Joy Bang.

61
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:11,892
I mean, it was just her
career that bit the dust.

62
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:14,528
Ah, she's still out
there somewhere,

63
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:18,098
and I like to think
she is still bangin'.

64
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:22,770
And speaking of bangin', we
have a bangin' beginning, baby.

65
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:24,805
We're kicking off
this feast o' fear

66
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,408
with my very
favorite movie ever,

67
00:03:27,408 --> 00:03:31,679
since the night I was born
40 years ago in that stable,

68
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:34,047
just me and the drummer boy.

69
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:37,117
Ooh, and boy, was he hot, ow!

70
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:39,387
In fact, this movie's so good,

71
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:41,522
I can't imagine how
we can afford it,

72
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,625
unless it's because
we're shooting in a
condemned warehouse

73
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,960
with no electricity
and no running water,

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:51,198
no craft services and no
fourth wall, for real.

75
00:03:51,198 --> 00:03:52,733
(ghost moans)

76
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:56,770
Oh, and that one
pissed off ghost

77
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,972
(ghost screams)

78
00:03:58,972 --> 00:04:00,708
and his girlfriend

79
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,109
(ghost dog howls)

80
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,043
and their dog?

81
00:04:05,513 --> 00:04:07,981
Ugh, god, they are so whiny.

82
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:09,950
It's just hard to root for 'em.

83
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,385
Just my two cents.

84
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:12,920
Well, in any case,

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,390
this film shows up on top
10 lists year after year.

86
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,660
You've seen them, "The
Godfather", "Star Wars",

87
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,029
"Lord of the Rings", "Titanic",

88
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,365
"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark".

89
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:26,567
"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark",

90
00:04:26,567 --> 00:04:29,169
starring yours cruelly.

91
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,572
It's the only movie
in film history

92
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:36,577
to be called ahead of its time
and outdated simultaneously.

93
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:39,713
Oh, and if you don't know
what that word is, no biggie.

94
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:41,649
I'm not gonna use
it again tonight,

95
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,351
but enough about the
English language.

96
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:47,120
More about me and my movie.

97
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,557
The technical
achievements of this film,

98
00:04:49,557 --> 00:04:54,562
the effects, that script,
the acting, the dog,

99
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:56,163
everything about
this motion picture

100
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,831
will shock and amaze you,

101
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,801
and not just because it's
tasteless, salacious,

102
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:04,104
offensive, and
completely fabulous,

103
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:08,342
but because, with me, there's
always a happy ending,

104
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:10,378
if you catch my drift.

105
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:14,582
"Elvira, Mistress of the
Dark" came out in 1988,

106
00:05:14,582 --> 00:05:18,352
just like Elton John,
and also just like him,

107
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:22,656
it touched a lot of
people, mostly male.

108
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,326
And now, ladies and Dobermans,
for your consideration,

109
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,830
"Elvira, Mistress of the Dark".

110
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:36,970
(suspenseful music)

111
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:58,759
(dramatic music)

112
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,267
- So that's what you look like.

113
00:06:07,267 --> 00:06:09,470
You're ugly, horrible.

114
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,173
Go on, try your intellect on me.

115
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:15,142
I'll see you in hell first.

116
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:18,846
(gun fires)
(woman screams)

117
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:19,780
Help! Stop!

118
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,151
- Let's get out of here.

119
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,253
Call off your troops.

120
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,421
- He's firing.

121
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:32,259
(wind roars)

122
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:36,830
(man groans)

123
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,401
- He acted like he knew it.

124
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,402
- He did.

125
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:46,807
He learned almost too late
that man is a feeling creature.

126
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:50,478
And because of it, the
greatest in the universe.

127
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,049
There is hope, but it has
to come from man itself.

128
00:06:58,385 --> 00:07:00,488
- I have to go,
I'm gonna eat now.

129
00:07:00,488 --> 00:07:02,222
Hold on just a second.

130
00:07:02,222 --> 00:07:04,825
- [Crew] Let's tie it up, baby.

131
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:10,531
- Hello, darling.

132
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:13,100
It's me again, yours
cruelly, Elvira,

133
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,870
the gal with the
enormous, uh, ratings.

134
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,939
Well, that's our show.

135
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:23,143
I hope you enjoyed watching
it as much as I did.

136
00:07:23,143 --> 00:07:25,513
(gags) Oh, boy.

137
00:07:25,513 --> 00:07:27,748
I mean, could you believe
that cheesy-looking monster?

138
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:30,551
Looked like Gumby on steroids.

139
00:07:30,551 --> 00:07:32,419
Well, at least the
movie had a moral.

140
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:34,321
- Where's the shrimp tempura?

141
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:36,389
- Tempura, you ordered it?

142
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,891
This is mine.

143
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,460
- Hey, does anybody know
what that movie was about?

144
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,762
I'll tell you what it was about,

145
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,964
it was about an hour
and a half too long.

146
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:48,135
Oh, and don't forget, next week,

147
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,203
it's the head with two things,

148
00:07:50,203 --> 00:07:51,639
I mean "The Thing
With Two Heads".

149
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,107
And until then, this is Elvira,

150
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:57,811
the gal who put the boobs
back in the boob tube,

151
00:07:57,811 --> 00:08:02,750
saying unpleasant dreams.
(spooky music)

152
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:06,186
- [Crew] Got the news in
one minute and counting.

153
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,020
- Very nice.

154
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,222
What are you going?

155
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:10,891
Hey, put me down, will ya?

156
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,125
- How do you expect
me to fix your hair

157
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,493
if you keep moving around?
- Idiot.

158
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,095
- Thanks, you guys.

159
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:20,200
- Is there anything that
could possibly shame you?

160
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,003
- Yeah, wearing this in a
public place might do it.

161
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,576
- Get it, girlfriend.

162
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:30,110
- We got the news and counting.

163
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:33,380
- Elvira.

164
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,447
- Not now, Rudy.

165
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,983
- Wait a sec, wait a sec.

166
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:37,618
See that guy over there?

167
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:40,120
- What, the lard bucket
in the 10 gallon hat?

168
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,590
- Yes, that's the
station new owner.

169
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,225
- From the edge of the sea
to the end of the valley.

170
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:47,094
- You what?
- Shut up!

171
00:08:47,094 --> 00:08:48,128
Relax, relax.

172
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:51,064
This guy's a millionaire, okay?

173
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:55,936
Mr. Hooter, this is Elvira.

174
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:01,141
- Name's Earl, but the ladies
back home call me Longhorn.

175
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:03,844
Maybe you can guess why?

176
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:05,345
- Gee, I don't know.

177
00:09:05,345 --> 00:09:08,248
Does it have anything
to do with your breath?

178
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,483
- Why don't we let this little
filly get herself gussied up.

179
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:14,221
The sooner I get in
the saddle, the better.

180
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:16,657
- Well, I'm sorry, partner,

181
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:18,358
but it look like
it's gonna be you

182
00:09:18,358 --> 00:09:20,360
and your trusty old right hand.

183
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,130
- Sounds like you're looking
to get yourself fired,

184
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,064
little lady.

185
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,565
- Go ahead and fire me.

186
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,301
I need this job like a leper
needs a three-way mirror.

187
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:32,005
It just so happens I have an
act opening up in Las Vegas.

188
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:35,342
- Well, terrific, you can
try your act out on me.

189
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:37,310
It's milking time.

190
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,346
(Mr. Hooter yelps)

191
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:41,081
- That's it, I'm walking.

192
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,315
I don't have to take
this from anybody,

193
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:45,152
and as for you, you
cretinous cowpoke,

194
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:47,020
if I ever see-
- She's got Hooter.

195
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,722
Somebody on the floor
get her outta there.

196
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,691
- Within so much
as 10 feet of me,

197
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,994
and I'm gonna tie your
weenie in a granny knot.

198
00:09:53,994 --> 00:09:56,196
(table clatters)

199
00:09:56,196 --> 00:09:58,098
- But you said she was a bimbo.

200
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,299
- [Crew] Come on, will you?

201
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:02,903
Not the ballgame. (groans)

202
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:04,204
- You can't quit.

203
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,438
- What's the big deal?

204
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,606
As soon as my show
opens in Las Vegas,

205
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:07,875
I'll never have to host

206
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,077
one of those crappo
horror movies again.

207
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:12,646
There's no problem with
the show, is there?

208
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:14,915
- Problem. (laughs)

209
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:17,384
Complications maybe,
but never a problem.

210
00:10:17,384 --> 00:10:19,519
- All right, out with it, Manny.

211
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,523
- Okay, The Flamingo won't
go ahead with the show

212
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,659
unless you come up with some
money to help finance it.

213
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,327
- [Elvira] How
much do they want?

214
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,029
- $50,000.

215
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:31,498
- $50,000?

216
00:10:32,833 --> 00:10:34,134
Are you nuts?

217
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,403
Where am I gonna come up
with that kind of money?

218
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:38,806
- Maybe it's not too late
to get your job back?

219
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:40,107
- Forget it, Manny.

220
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,042
I'm never working for
that sleazeball again.

221
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,179
I'll just have to find
another sleazeball.

222
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:48,448
(messenger knocks at door)

223
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,382
- [Messenger] Telegram
for Miss Elvira.

224
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:50,383
- I'll take it.

225
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,891
- Dear Elvira, as executor of
the estate of your great aunt,

226
00:10:57,891 --> 00:11:00,193
Ms. Morgana Talbot,
I'm sorry to inform you

227
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:03,296
of her untimely passing.

228
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,832
- Whoa, I didn't even
know I had a good aunt,

229
00:11:04,832 --> 00:11:06,333
much less a great one.

230
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:07,167
Let me see that.

231
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,003
It says here, all I have to do

232
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,805
is come to Fallwell,
Massachusetts,

233
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:13,173
for the reading of the will,

234
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,474
and I'll pick up my inheritance.

235
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,910
Is that timing or what?

236
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,681
(Elvira sniffles)

237
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:26,086
- And lastly, to my
enchanting niece, Elvira,

238
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:27,855
who has unflinchingly withstood

239
00:11:27,855 --> 00:11:30,457
the slings and arrows
of an imperfect world

240
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:34,161
without so much as a
whimper or complaint,

241
00:11:35,829 --> 00:11:39,132
I bequeath my entire fortune.

242
00:11:42,069 --> 00:11:44,171
(Elvira sobs)

243
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:48,275
Let's show Elvira exactly
what she's inherited.

244
00:11:48,275 --> 00:11:50,811
(upbeat music)

245
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,482
Elvira, you are going to start

246
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:58,185
with something that
dreams are made of,

247
00:11:58,185 --> 00:12:00,653
a beautiful new sailboat!

248
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:06,659
You're going to sail away
sporty Sunchaser 2 from Snark.

249
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,362
And that's not all.

250
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,164
When you're tired of sailing,

251
00:12:11,164 --> 00:12:14,601
you'll drive home in this
brand new Jeep Wrangler!

252
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:17,237
- I needed one of those.

253
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,638
- And you'll sit down to dinner

254
00:12:18,638 --> 00:12:21,674
at this beautiful
10-piece dining room suite

255
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:25,512
from American Heritage.
(Elvira screams)

256
00:12:25,512 --> 00:12:28,281
And on top of all
of that, money!

257
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,020
Lots and lots of money!

258
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,128
- Elvira, Elvira!

259
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:42,229
Are you all right?

260
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,298
- Go ahead and call
The Flamingo, Manny.

261
00:12:45,298 --> 00:12:46,800
Tell them I'll
have that 50 grand

262
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,269
as soon as I get back
from Massachusetts.

263
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:51,238
Las Vegas, here I come.

264
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:55,442
(upbeat rock music)

265
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:58,278
* Hey hey

266
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,314
* Hey hey

267
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:04,184
* Hey hey

268
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,886
* Hey hey

269
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:08,221
* I've been around,
round and round *

270
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:13,226
* I broke it up, 'cause
you shot me down, yeah *

271
00:13:13,994 --> 00:13:17,064
* Oh yeah

272
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:18,331
- Hop in, sailor.

273
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:20,901
* I took a ride on
your winding road *

274
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:25,906
* Told you some secrets I
ain't ever told before *

275
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:30,277
* No more

276
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:32,745
* Say, if you wanna
meet me halfway *

277
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,747
- Here, you forgot your axe.

278
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:37,184
(hitchhiker screams)

279
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:41,855
* I said once
bitten, twice shy *

280
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:46,559
* I said once
bitten, twice shy *

281
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,929
(wolf howls)

282
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,265
* There's a place
just down the road *

283
00:13:52,265 --> 00:13:57,270
* Where the little ones
have fallen souls, oh yeah *

284
00:13:57,938 --> 00:13:59,672
* Oh yeah

285
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,541
(siren blares)

286
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:04,311
* Take me to Shanghai,
take me away *

287
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,881
* I need a rest from
this crazy masquerade *

288
00:14:07,881 --> 00:14:09,082
- You know you were doing 50

289
00:14:09,082 --> 00:14:11,018
in a 25 mile per hour zone?

290
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:15,855
- Um, no, but if you hum a few
bars, I'll fake it. (laughs)

291
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:22,896
I gotta get a new joke.

292
00:14:22,896 --> 00:14:24,497
This one's costing me a fortune.

293
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:30,670
* I said once
bitten, twice shy *

294
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,347
(attendant passes gas)

295
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:52,292
* I go inside and order up
some chicken fried steak *

296
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,660
- Hey?

297
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,162
How about some gas?

298
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:59,499
* Chicken fried steak,
oh, chicken fried steak *

299
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:04,437
* Taters and gravy
and peas on a plate *

300
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,439
(Elvira slams door)

301
00:15:06,439 --> 00:15:08,875
* Bring me two orders,
don't make no mistake *

302
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,880
* There ain't nothin' better
than chicken fried steak *

303
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,017
* Well, the first bite
is the best bite *

304
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,652
* It's the one
that sets me free *

305
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:24,657
* Smothered in gravy,
it drips all over me *

306
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,694
* My teeth sink down into it

307
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:30,097
* It's more than I can take

308
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:35,102
* When I started chewing on
that chicken fried steak *

309
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:41,074
* Chicken fried steak,
oh, chicken fried steak *

310
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:46,079
* Taters and gravy
and peas on a plate *

311
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,315
- You know, those
things'll kill ya.

312
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,819
- Have a nice day!

313
00:15:56,356 --> 00:16:01,161
* If there ever comes a time
I get my gun and I go wrong *

314
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:03,430
* And the just says I must die

315
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,133
* 'Cause the jury
wants me gone *

316
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:09,402
(gas station explodes)

317
00:16:11,238 --> 00:16:14,241
(upbeat rock music)

318
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:22,715
* Hey, hey, hey

319
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:39,932
* Just like a cat
on a hot tin roof *

320
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:43,203
* Feel I'm feminine,
why can't you lose her *

321
00:16:43,203 --> 00:16:48,208
* Once bitten, twice shy

322
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:53,380
* I said once
bitten, twice shy *

323
00:16:54,981 --> 00:16:59,686
* I said once
bitten, twice shy *

324
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,021
(wolf howls)

325
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,994
(church bells ring)

326
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:10,763
(peaceful music)

327
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,538
(upbeat rock music)

328
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:21,208
* Say if you wanna
meet me halfway *

329
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,410
* Too damn bad

330
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:28,415
* I said once
bitten, twice shy *

331
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:34,721
* I said once
bitten, twice shy *

332
00:17:36,189 --> 00:17:37,390
* Come on

333
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,758
- I can make darn sure
he doesn't get it.

334
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,059
I have my ways, you know.

335
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,666
(car hood clatters)

336
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,804
- [Man] Keep the
kids back, honey.

337
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,273
- Well.

338
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,107
- Oh, oh.

339
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,610
Well, I never.

340
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,547
- Yeah, and you never will with
them soup cans on your head.

341
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,814
- Listen, young lady.

342
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:03,816
I don't know who you are
or where you came from,

343
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,519
but you most certainly
don't fit in this town.

344
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,455
Why, you don't even
fit in that dress.

345
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:12,259
- Listen, sister, if
I want your opinion,

346
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:13,460
I'll beat it outta ya.

347
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,028
- Anita.

348
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,699
Anita, it's the antichrist,
I tell you, the antichrist.

349
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,669
- Can someone tell me where
there's a garage around here?

350
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,172
- Yeah, yeah, there's
one right up the street.

351
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:26,439
- Oh, (chuckles)

352
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,809
well, would one of
you big strong men

353
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:32,245
mind giving me a little push?

354
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:38,618
(upbeat rock music)

355
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:40,720
Easy, easy, don't
scratch the paint.

356
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,261
- She's incredible.

357
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:49,729
- Man, what I wouldn't do

358
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:51,898
for just one peek
at those gazongas.

359
00:18:51,898 --> 00:18:52,932
- [Boy] They're unreal.

360
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:55,101
- Oh, great.

361
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,469
That means I'm stuck
in this hell hole.

362
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,538
I mean this quaint
little hell hole.

363
00:18:58,538 --> 00:19:01,774
Listen, is there a motel
or something around here?

364
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,376
- Well, there's the Cozy Cot,

365
00:19:03,376 --> 00:19:06,145
down by the Widow
Bishop's feed store.

366
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,281
Of course, her son
sort of took that over

367
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,917
after she had that
spelled a gingivitis.

368
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:13,186
Her whole mouth swole up.

369
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:15,922
It looked like she
ate a box of staples.

370
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:17,156
Folks were saying she got it

371
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,091
from kissing that
old dog of hers.

372
00:19:22,429 --> 00:19:23,963
Nice tits.

373
00:19:23,963 --> 00:19:26,966
(upbeat rock music)

374
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:34,507
(wolf howls)

375
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,044
- Yoo-hoo?

376
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,482
(bell rings)

377
00:19:42,482 --> 00:19:43,983
Can I have a room?

378
00:19:47,887 --> 00:19:50,189
- Sorry, we're booked solid.

379
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,191
- So how come it says
vacancy out there?

380
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,367
- Look, we do have a room.

381
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,201
Remember the trucker
with the bad skin

382
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,603
that checked out this morning?

383
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,472
- Ew, I hope you
changed the sheets.

384
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:10,710
(striking guitar riff)

385
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,413
Hi.

386
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,182
- Is that makeup I see
on your face, young lady?

387
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:18,518
- No, ma'am.

388
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,019
I mean, yes, ma'am.

389
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,187
Well, just a little.

390
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,355
- How many times have I told you

391
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,391
you're too young to wear makeup?

392
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:25,592
- Now, Mother,

393
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:27,394
I don't see the harm-
- Shut up, Lesley.

394
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:28,861
- But Grandma,

395
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:30,397
all the other girls at
school are wearing makeup.

396
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:32,565
- Well, if all the other girls
at school jumped off a cliff,

397
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:34,166
would you jump off a cliff?

398
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,436
What, and you don't
have that sense

399
00:20:36,436 --> 00:20:37,370
that you weren't born with.

400
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,871
(bell rings)

401
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:41,140
- I hate to interrupt this
little episode of "The Waltons",

402
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,109
but could I get a room?

403
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:46,646
- Okay, but it's cash up front.

404
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:51,618
I know what you pinko heavy
metal weirdos do to motel rooms.

405
00:20:52,685 --> 00:20:55,121
Read all about it in "The Star".

406
00:20:55,121 --> 00:20:56,889
- I'll show the
lady to her room.

407
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,124
- Oh, no, you don't.

408
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:03,029
(upbeat rock music)

409
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,135
- Hey, don't let
'em get you down.

410
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:10,670
I used to get the
same line about makeup

411
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,472
from the nuns at the orphanage.

412
00:21:12,472 --> 00:21:14,040
Of course, I was only eight.

413
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,942
Uh, I'm Elvira.

414
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:17,777
- I'm Robin.

415
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:22,949
- So, Robin, what's there to
do for fun around here anyway?

416
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:25,084
- This town isn't
real big on fun.

417
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,519
- [Elvira] Hmm.

418
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,356
- Well, there is one place
that's open, the bowling alley.

419
00:21:29,356 --> 00:21:31,324
That gets real wild
on league night.

420
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:34,827
- Gee, I think I can handle it.

421
00:21:34,827 --> 00:21:37,997
(upbeat rock music)

422
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,567
(pins clatter)

423
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:45,772
- Oh, I am so sure.

424
00:21:45,772 --> 00:21:47,707
They must think
we're really stupid.

425
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:50,142
They're gonna kill
Spiderman with plutonium?

426
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:52,512
He's got radioactive blood.

427
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,846
- Oh, yeah?

428
00:21:53,846 --> 00:21:54,914
Let me see that.

429
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,319
- Hey, man, what'd
you do that for?

430
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,087
- Shut up.

431
00:22:07,827 --> 00:22:10,162
Look at what just walked in.

432
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,607
- Ooh, um, Bloody Mary.

433
00:22:20,607 --> 00:22:22,442
- No hard liquor served
past eight o'clock.

434
00:22:22,442 --> 00:22:23,476
Do you want a virgin?

435
00:22:24,677 --> 00:22:27,179
- Maybe, but I'll have a
couple of drinks first.

436
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:31,784
(solemn country music)

437
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:42,562
- Hey, baby, I got
something to show you.

438
00:22:44,263 --> 00:22:46,633
- Sorry, I left my
magnifying glass at home.

439
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,439
- Hey, that's pretty good.

440
00:22:52,439 --> 00:22:56,042
Billy, no way to talk to a lady.

441
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:59,045
So how about a blowjob?

442
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:02,549
(Travis and Billy snicker)

443
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,990
(beer splashes)

444
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:21,668
I bet you think that was
pretty funny, don't ya?

445
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:23,135
- I enjoyed it.

446
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,638
- Yeah, well, you're gonna
enjoy this even more.

447
00:23:25,638 --> 00:23:27,306
- [Elvira] I'll cut you, man.

448
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:30,977
- [Billy] She stabbed me.

449
00:23:30,977 --> 00:23:32,244
- Faked ya out.

450
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,080
- [Travis] Yeah, well,
this ain't fake, baby,

451
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,215
so stand still,
'cause I'm gonna-

452
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:38,785
(punches thud)

453
00:23:42,722 --> 00:23:46,559
- My name's Elvira, but
you can call me tonight.

454
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:50,930
- I'm Bob, Bob Redding.

455
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,931
Pleased to meet you.

456
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,801
- Look at this mess.

457
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:56,302
Who the heck is
gonna pay for it?

458
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:58,605
- It's all right, Patty, I'll
take care of the damages.

459
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:02,341
- Seems to me it's all this
cheap little tart's fault.

460
00:24:02,341 --> 00:24:03,275
- Cheap?

461
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,811
Who are you callin' cheap?

462
00:24:04,811 --> 00:24:07,246
What's that perfume you're
wearing, catch of the day?

463
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:10,983
- Look, honey, I don't know
which hole you crawled out of,

464
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,952
but I suggest you
crawl right back in

465
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,554
if you know what's good for you.

466
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:16,989
- You better watch out.

467
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,591
You could put somebody's
eyes out with them things.

468
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:21,227
(Elvira clears throat)

469
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,895
- Break it up.
- We'd better go.

470
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,736
- It looks like you've got
some competition, Patty.

471
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:36,208
- Charlie, trash does
not compete with class.

472
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:42,214
- Right down the
street at the Cozy Cot.

473
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:43,015
- Oh.

474
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,185
So, what brought
you to Fallwell?

475
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,787
- My car.

476
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:49,522
(Bob laughs)

477
00:24:49,522 --> 00:24:51,123
No, really, I'm
here for the reading

478
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:53,693
of my great aunt Morgana's will

479
00:24:53,693 --> 00:24:56,362
- Morgana Talbot,
she's your aunt?

480
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:59,832
- Yeah, it came as a
surprise to me, too.

481
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:03,135
- I never really knew her,
but I sure admired her spunk.

482
00:25:03,135 --> 00:25:06,539
She never caved in the way
everybody else in this town has.

483
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:09,609
Well, I don't want to bore
you with local politics.

484
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:12,411
- Go ahead, bore me.

485
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,848
- Okay, we've got
this town council

486
00:25:15,848 --> 00:25:18,618
that lives in mortal
fear that somewhere,

487
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,921
somehow, somebody in Fallwell
is having a good time.

488
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:24,356
- Oh, a bunch of real
preservatives, huh?

489
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,059
- Oh. (chuckles)

490
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,527
I run the movie house.

491
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,528
- Oh, really?

492
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,197
I'm in movies, too.

493
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,601
Have you ever shown
"I Married Satan"?

494
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:35,902
- No.

495
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:38,738
- How about the sequel,
"I Married Satan 2"?

496
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:39,572
- No.

497
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:41,974
- Uh, hmm.

498
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:45,311
- I can only play
G-rated movies.

499
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:48,080
- Oh, well, there's nothing
wrong with G-rated movies,

500
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,083
as long as there's lots
of sex and violence.

501
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,920
Hey, listen, Bob, I'm
only gonna be in town

502
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:57,323
for a couple of days and
I can't think of anyone

503
00:25:57,323 --> 00:26:00,993
who I'd rather squeeze
into my agenda.

504
00:26:02,695 --> 00:26:03,863
- Gee, that'd be swell.

505
00:26:12,004 --> 00:26:13,305
(truck door slams)

506
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:16,075
(engine rumbles)

507
00:26:26,653 --> 00:26:28,287
- Oh, Mr. Talbot.

508
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,960
Your sister was
like a mother to me.

509
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,362
- She was a mother
to me, too, dear.

510
00:26:36,362 --> 00:26:38,364
Well, now that we've dispensed

511
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:40,432
with the obligatory
display of bereavement,

512
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,702
you may begin the
proceedings, Mr. Bigelow.

513
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:46,906
- It was Mrs. Talbot's wish
to have all of her relatives

514
00:26:46,906 --> 00:26:48,374
present for the
reading of the will.

515
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:51,110
- All of her
relatives are present,

516
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,013
me, myself, and I.

517
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:00,486
- Well, apparently, Mrs. Talbot
has a grand niece, Elvira,

518
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,989
who is also one of
the beneficiaries.

519
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:04,757
- That's impossible.

520
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:05,692
- Well-

521
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:07,960
- Who is this grand niece?

522
00:27:09,328 --> 00:27:11,063
- Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

523
00:27:11,063 --> 00:27:12,331
But then, so's my aunt.

524
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:14,066
Hey, what'd she die of?

525
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,902
Nothing serious, I hope.

526
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,503
Say, nice jacket.

527
00:27:17,503 --> 00:27:20,272
Who shot the couch? (laughs)

528
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,241
Hey, is there a
bathroom around here?

529
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,876
I'm telling you, that
toilet over at the Cozy Cot

530
00:27:23,876 --> 00:27:26,278
looks like somebody's
science project.

531
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:28,114
- Who is this woman?

532
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:32,018
- This must be Mrs.
Talbot's grand niece.

533
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:37,023
Elvira, this is your great
aunt's brother, Vincent Talbot.

534
00:27:37,023 --> 00:27:40,526
- If she was my aunt
and you're her brother,

535
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:43,863
then you must be my Uncle Vinny!

536
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:46,833
- Get this woman off of me.

537
00:27:46,833 --> 00:27:50,903
- Oh, and you must be
Auntie Em and Uncle Remus.

538
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:52,671
Oh, there's no place like home.

539
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,174
There's no place like home.

540
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,377
- Hurry up, Bigelow,
let's get on with it.

541
00:27:58,377 --> 00:27:59,812
- Yeah, really.

542
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:02,915
Let's get going before
somebody else dies. (laughs)

543
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:10,622
- This is the certified and
only last will and testament

544
00:28:10,622 --> 00:28:13,459
of the deceased, Morgana Talbot.

545
00:28:13,459 --> 00:28:16,028
To my housekeeper,
Mrs. Morrissey,

546
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,797
for years of loyalty
and devotion,

547
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:19,498
I leave my silver tea service

548
00:28:19,498 --> 00:28:22,034
and a cash allotment of $5,000.

549
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:23,970
- Oh, no. (sobs)

550
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,006
- Hey, babe, what
you whining about?

551
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,607
You made out like a bandit.

552
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,478
- To Mr. Morrissey, my driver,

553
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:36,749
I leave my automobile and
an allotment of $5,000.

554
00:28:36,749 --> 00:28:38,951
- Whoa, dude, 10 grand
just for the help?

555
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:42,288
That old gal must have
really been loaded.

556
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:45,657
Oh, I mean, dear, sweet Aunt
Morgana certainly was generous.

557
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,194
What's it say about me?

558
00:28:48,194 --> 00:28:49,762
What'd I get, what'd
I get, what'd I get?

559
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:54,200
- To my grand niece, Elvira.

560
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,935
- Come on, lay it
on me, Aunt Morgana.

561
00:28:55,935 --> 00:28:57,770
Big bucks, big bucks.

562
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,977
- I bequeath my house, my
beloved poodle, Algonquin,

563
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:06,913
and my precious book of recipes.

564
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,081
- That's it?

565
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,449
A house, a dog, and a book.

566
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,120
- Please, if you will
allow me to finish.

567
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,224
And finally, to my
dear brother, Vincent,

568
00:29:18,224 --> 00:29:21,393
I leave the rest of my
estate and holdings,

569
00:29:21,393 --> 00:29:22,761
of which there is none.

570
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:27,166
- Where's the cash?

571
00:29:27,166 --> 00:29:29,001
Where's the furniture?

572
00:29:29,001 --> 00:29:30,569
Where's Bob Eubanks?

573
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,840
- He wasn't mentioned.

574
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,109
- I don't get it, man,

575
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,578
boss, what's so important
about a dumb recipe book?

576
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:43,215
- That dumb recipe book
contains more power

577
00:29:43,215 --> 00:29:45,918
than your feeble little
minds can ever imagine,

578
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,653
and it rightfully belongs to me.

579
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:50,122
I must have that book.

580
00:29:51,323 --> 00:29:52,992
- Great, just what
I need, a house.

581
00:29:52,992 --> 00:29:55,895
I need a house in Fallwell
like I need a padded bra.

582
00:29:57,396 --> 00:29:58,330
I can't live here.

583
00:29:58,330 --> 00:30:00,199
I'll go crazy, I tell ya.

584
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,935
(man grunts)

585
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:03,769
- Crazy!

586
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:07,940
- May I offer you a ride?

587
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,942
- Buzz off, creep,
I'm not in the mood.

588
00:30:09,942 --> 00:30:11,510
Oh, it's you, Uncle Vinny.

589
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:12,344
- Yes.

590
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:15,414
Uncle Vinny.

591
00:30:15,414 --> 00:30:17,984
I must apologize for my
behavior in the office.

592
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:21,487
It's just that your appearance
was a bit of a shock to me.

593
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:22,721
- That's okay.

594
00:30:22,721 --> 00:30:23,956
My appearance is kind
of a shock to everybody.

595
00:30:23,956 --> 00:30:26,425
- Yes, well, as you
may have surmised,

596
00:30:26,425 --> 00:30:28,027
my sister and I, well,

597
00:30:28,027 --> 00:30:32,031
let's just say we
had our differences.

598
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,232
- Yeah, I guess.

599
00:30:33,232 --> 00:30:34,967
You really got shafted.

600
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,569
Look, I'll tell you
what, Uncle Vinny,

601
00:30:37,569 --> 00:30:39,305
I'll share my
inheritance with you.

602
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:40,139
You can have a dog.

603
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:41,273
- No, thank you.

604
00:30:42,774 --> 00:30:45,945
But I would be interested in
acquiring that recipe book,

605
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:47,947
you know, for
sentimental reasons,

606
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:50,616
I'd be willing to
pay you, say, $50.

607
00:30:50,616 --> 00:30:53,152
- Hey, sure, I'll
do it for 50 bucks.

608
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:53,953
- Oh.

609
00:30:55,621 --> 00:30:57,356
- Vinny, you got
yourself a cookbook.

610
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:59,025
That lawyer guy is taking
me over to the house,

611
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:00,292
so you can pick
it up there later.

612
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:01,894
- Fine, I'll see you there.

613
00:31:03,295 --> 00:31:07,900
- Oh, don't forget to
bring the cash. (chuckles)

614
00:31:08,367 --> 00:31:08,800
- Drive.

615
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:11,904
* If one of those bottles
should happen to fall *

616
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:12,738
- Oh, we're here.

617
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,411
- [Child] I'm coming, wait up!

618
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:22,714
- Hey, this place
ain't half bad.

619
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,616
Bet you could get
a bundle for it.

620
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,886
- Yes, you could, but
your house is over there.

621
00:31:29,355 --> 00:31:31,958
(spooky music)

622
00:31:41,367 --> 00:31:43,970
- Oh, Mr. Talbot, I
just wanted to thank you

623
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,872
for that generous donation
you made to the Morality Club.

624
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:48,374
- You're quite welcome.

625
00:31:48,374 --> 00:31:51,077
You know, as I always
say, morals aren't cheap.

626
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,878
And speaking of cheap,

627
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:55,581
a little birdie told me
that that Elvira woman

628
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,283
is related to you.

629
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:59,885
Now, not that it's
any of my business,

630
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:01,720
but then, of course
everything is.

631
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,124
- Believe me, I'm as anxious
to get rid of her as you are.

632
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:06,392
- Oh, good, you know,

633
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:08,160
because someone like
that comes to town,

634
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,361
the next thing you know,

635
00:32:09,361 --> 00:32:11,197
they're teaching sex
education in the schools

636
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:13,599
and they're passing out
condoms to kindergartners.

637
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,601
You remember when
those swarthy fellows-

638
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,536
- She won't be
with us very long.

639
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,239
- Oh, um.

640
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,174
Why, uh.

641
00:32:23,342 --> 00:32:25,444
Well, I know I'm
needed somewhere.

642
00:32:25,444 --> 00:32:27,479
Chastity Pariah can do.

643
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,480
Bye bye now.

644
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:32,851
(spooky music)

645
00:32:32,851 --> 00:32:34,886
- Careful, some of
the boards are loose.

646
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,459
- What a dump.

647
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,861
- Like I said, the house
needs a little something.

648
00:32:44,196 --> 00:32:46,798
- Yeah, like a wrecking ball.

649
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,635
(Algonquin barks)

650
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,505
- I think Algonquin likes you.

651
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:54,940
- Here doggy, go on.

652
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,475
Go chase this into the street.

653
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,679
I can't stand little dogs.

654
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:02,914
Boy, if my aunt wasn't
dead, I kill her.

655
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:06,085
(floorboard creaks)

656
00:33:06,085 --> 00:33:07,653
Sorry, Aunt Morgana.

657
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:08,787
Just kiddin'.

658
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,861
- Here's the rest
of your inheritance,

659
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:17,929
your great aunt's recipe book.

660
00:33:23,302 --> 00:33:25,404
- Oh, yeah, some inheritance.

661
00:33:25,404 --> 00:33:27,573
Well, at least I'm
getting 50 bucks for it.

662
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,609
Say, how much you think I
could get for this place?

663
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:32,944
- Well, even though the
house is in disrepair,

664
00:33:32,944 --> 00:33:34,646
it is in a prime location.

665
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,849
I'd venture to say
you could get 70,000.

666
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,151
- 70 grand?

667
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:40,886
- Maybe more, if
it were fixed up.

668
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:43,089
Would you be
interested in selling?

669
00:33:43,089 --> 00:33:45,057
- Does the chicken
have a pecker?

670
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:45,891
Course I'm interested.

671
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:53,932
(quizzical music)

672
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:56,001
Now, what am I
gonna do with you?

673
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:01,573
(upbeat rock music)

674
00:34:01,573 --> 00:34:04,243
(clippers whir)

675
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:07,679
That's more like it, Algonquin.

676
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:12,084
Algonquin, what a sissy name.

677
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,087
Let's see, what do I call ya?

678
00:34:15,087 --> 00:34:16,755
I know, Gonk.

679
00:34:16,755 --> 00:34:18,056
How do you like that?

680
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:21,260
(Gonk growls)

681
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,695
(Gonk barks)

682
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:30,269
(Vincent knocks)

683
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:32,338
Yeah, hold your horses.

684
00:34:32,338 --> 00:34:35,674
(Vincent knocks)

685
00:34:35,674 --> 00:34:36,608
Hi, Uncle Vinny.

686
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,409
You're here for the book, right?

687
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,744
Come on in.

688
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,212
Oh, can I make you a
cup of tea or something?

689
00:34:40,212 --> 00:34:42,548
- I wouldn't want to
put you to any trouble.

690
00:34:42,548 --> 00:34:44,150
- Hmm, good point.

691
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,452
- I can't stay very long anyway.

692
00:34:46,452 --> 00:34:48,687
- Say, you wouldn't want
to buy a house, would ya?

693
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:49,955
- I'm afraid not.

694
00:34:49,955 --> 00:34:50,856
- I'll sell it to
you really cheap.

695
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,358
- No, thank you.

696
00:34:52,358 --> 00:34:54,326
- Vinny, they don't make
houses like this anymore.

697
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:56,128
I mean, looking at detailing,

698
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:58,029
look at that craftsmanship.

699
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01,233
What would you pay
for a house like this?

700
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,169
Don't answer, because
you not only get a house,

701
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,403
if you act right now,

702
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,372
you also get all this
beautiful furniture.

703
00:35:06,372 --> 00:35:07,606
Now, what would you pay?

704
00:35:07,606 --> 00:35:08,707
I'm telling you
it's a jewel box,

705
00:35:08,707 --> 00:35:10,576
a gem, a love hutch for two.

706
00:35:10,576 --> 00:35:12,311
I'd bend over backwards
to make you a deal.

707
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:13,512
I'd bend over forwards.

708
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:15,147
Well, I'd on my
head and eat a bug.

709
00:35:15,147 --> 00:35:16,114
- No!

710
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,283
Just the book!

711
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:21,653
- Okay, if you're gonna
get crabby about it.

712
00:35:23,889 --> 00:35:26,992
(floorboard squeaks)

713
00:35:29,261 --> 00:35:30,729
That's weird.

714
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,131
I would have sworn the book
was just on that table.

715
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,201
- You promised me that book.

716
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,303
- Hey, don't get your
panties in a bunch.

717
00:35:37,303 --> 00:35:38,737
Didn't just walk away.

718
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:39,671
I'm sure it'll turn up.

719
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:42,708
- Yes, of course it will.

720
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,511
Forgive me.

721
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,717
(Gonk growls)

722
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:52,884
Thinks he's a pit bull.

723
00:35:57,256 --> 00:36:00,058
(thunder rumbles)

724
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:06,031
(bed squeaks)

725
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:07,866
Good thing I'm not
gonna be here very long.

726
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:09,668
Neighbors would
never get any sleep.

727
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,440
(rain splatters)

728
00:36:17,243 --> 00:36:19,144
- About time, doofus.

729
00:36:19,144 --> 00:36:20,712
Did you bring the camera?

730
00:36:20,712 --> 00:36:21,980
- What do I look like, an idiot?

731
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,181
- You really want
me to answer that?

732
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,015
- Shut up, you guys.

733
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:24,850
She's gonna hear us.

734
00:36:36,695 --> 00:36:38,764
- Mirror, mirror on the wall,

735
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:41,900
who's the most drop dead
gorgeous one of all?

736
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,837
Oh, you're just saying that.

737
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:52,544
(thunder rumbles)

738
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:07,893
- [Bo] What do you see?

739
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,127
What do you see?
- In a minute.

740
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:10,061
In a minute.

741
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,397
- [Bo] Oh, my fingers.

742
00:37:11,397 --> 00:37:13,432
Guys, I can't see a thing.
- In a minute.

743
00:37:13,432 --> 00:37:16,001
(sultry music)

744
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:19,838
Whoa.

745
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:26,912
- [Bo] Hey, don't drop it.

746
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,414
- Ow.
- Let me see.

747
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:47,966
- Awesome.

748
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,504
I gotcha.

749
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:56,308
- [Bo] Guys, it's my turn.

750
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:57,576
Did you get it?

751
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:01,580
(Elvira screams)

752
00:38:02,914 --> 00:38:04,950
- Haven't you boys got
someplace else to hang around?

753
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:08,620
- We heard you might need a
little help fixing up the place.

754
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,088
- That's very thoughtful,

755
00:38:10,088 --> 00:38:12,123
but why don't you come back
when the light's better?

756
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,525
Okay, good night.

757
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:17,028
(boys yell)

758
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:20,499
- You blew it.

759
00:38:20,499 --> 00:38:22,768
- Did you see those gazongas?

760
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,536
- Awesome.
- I got it.

761
00:38:24,536 --> 00:38:27,673
- All right, yeah!
- All right.

762
00:38:27,673 --> 00:38:30,909
(thunder rumbles)

763
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:33,912
(suspenseful music)

764
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:37,549
- [Morgana] Elvira.

765
00:38:41,587 --> 00:38:42,421
Elvira.

766
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:54,299
Elvira.

767
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:05,877
Elvira.

768
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:21,660
(door creaks)

769
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:37,509
(Elvira screams)

770
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:51,623
- Oh, out, out, out, out.

771
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,727
(thunder rumbles)

772
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:08,206
(peaceful music)

773
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,313
- Hi, Elvira.

774
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:16,214
- Hi!

775
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:17,683
- Oh, hi, you're here.

776
00:40:17,683 --> 00:40:19,451
- Richard's folks run
the hardware store

777
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:20,819
and we got lots of paint.

778
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:23,722
- Oh, too bad they
don't own the bank.

779
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:24,923
Uh, I'll be right down.

780
00:40:27,726 --> 00:40:29,394
Let's do it.

781
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,896
* You know you make
me wanna shout *

782
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,130
* Kick my heels up and shout

783
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,932
* Throw my hands up and shout

784
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,433
* Throw my head back and shout

785
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,302
- Hey, Elvira, we got us
a couple more volunteers.

786
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:40,906
- Great, just grab a
tool and start bangin'.

787
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,041
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

788
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:45,110
* Say you will

789
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,612
* Say it right now, baby

790
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:50,749
* Say you will

791
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:53,685
- Hi, Elvira.

792
00:40:53,685 --> 00:40:55,587
- Hi, Robin, come on in.

793
00:40:55,587 --> 00:40:57,222
* Say that you need me

794
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,757
* You wanna please me

795
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,291
* Come on now

796
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,660
* Come on now

797
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:04,863
- Randy, can you
hand me that rag?

798
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,131
Randy?

799
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,400
- Sorry, I, yeah,
yeah, yeah, sure.

800
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,572
* When you used to
be nine years old *

801
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:15,006
- Young lady!

802
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:18,577
Robin Meeker, what in
the name of tarnation

803
00:41:18,577 --> 00:41:20,111
are you doing here?

804
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,247
You're gonna pay dearly.
- Robin?

805
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:24,650
- I'm going to find out
about this, young lady.

806
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,584
- Robin?

807
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:26,885
- [Grandma] Come over here.

808
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,587
When you gonna learn
to do what you're told?

809
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:30,355
If you don't learn to
do what you're told,

810
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,257
you're gonna end
up on the streets.

811
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,592
* You know you make
me wanna shout *

812
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:34,893
* Lift my head up and shout

813
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:36,427
* Throw my hands
back and shout *

814
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:38,096
* Come on, now, shout

815
00:41:38,096 --> 00:41:39,430
* Come on, now, shout

816
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:41,166
* Come on, now, shout

817
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,801
* All right, now, shout

818
00:41:42,801 --> 00:41:44,235
* Come on, now, shout

819
00:41:44,235 --> 00:41:45,571
* Come on, yeah, shout

820
00:41:45,571 --> 00:41:47,072
* Come on, now, shout

821
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:48,640
* Come on, yeah, shout

822
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,241
* Come on, now, shout

823
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:51,877
* Come on, shout

824
00:41:51,877 --> 00:41:53,879
* Come on, now, shout
- Lemonade?

825
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:57,015
* Come on, yeah, shout

826
00:41:57,015 --> 00:42:01,653
* Come on, now, shout

827
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:04,790
- It's fabulous.

828
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:06,658
* You know, you make
me wanna shout *

829
00:42:06,658 --> 00:42:08,727
(teens cheer)

830
00:42:08,727 --> 00:42:10,596
* Come on, now, shout

831
00:42:10,596 --> 00:42:11,897
* Come on, now

832
00:42:11,897 --> 00:42:13,298
- I tell you I nearly died.

833
00:42:13,298 --> 00:42:16,534
There she was, parading
around in clothes

834
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,937
that couldn't keep a
titmouse dry in a drizzle.

835
00:42:18,937 --> 00:42:21,840
I mean, it was next to nothing.

836
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,309
- I'd say it was next to plenty.

837
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,878
- And she had half
the teenagers in town

838
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:30,381
writhing around to
that jungle music.

839
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,617
- And this morning,

840
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,819
on my regular tour of
the boys' lavatory,

841
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,921
I confiscated this.

842
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:39,324
- Hmm.

843
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,896
- I'll be making the
announcement this afternoon.

844
00:42:44,896 --> 00:42:47,999
Henceforth, all
students will be subject

845
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,468
to immediate expulsion
if they are found

846
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:53,639
in the company of that floozy.

847
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:57,308
- Please, I don't think we
need to resort to name calling.

848
00:42:57,308 --> 00:42:59,010
I think what Calvin
is trying to say

849
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:03,514
is that this Elvira is
a person of easy virtue,

850
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,050
a purveyor of pulchritude,

851
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,620
a one-woman Sodom and
Gomorrah, if you will.

852
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:11,990
A slimy, slithering succubus,

853
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:15,126
a concubine, a streetwalker,
a tramp, a slut,

854
00:43:15,126 --> 00:43:16,194
a cheap whore!

855
00:43:17,996 --> 00:43:19,698
- She'll be nothing
but a bad dream

856
00:43:19,698 --> 00:43:21,599
just as soon as she
sells that property.

857
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,669
An open house has already
been planned for tomorrow.

858
00:43:23,669 --> 00:43:25,671
- But what if she
decides not to sell?

859
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:29,107
What if she decides
to settle here?

860
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:31,276
- Well, if she's morally unfit,

861
00:43:31,276 --> 00:43:33,779
then we have every right
to do anything we can

862
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:34,913
to get her out of this town.

863
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,481
Are we agreed?

864
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,916
- Here, here.
- Absolutely.

865
00:43:37,916 --> 00:43:40,051
- Maybe we're not being
entirely objective about this.

866
00:43:40,051 --> 00:43:41,787
- Shut up, Lesley.

867
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:43,154
- Then it's unanimous.

868
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,657
(gavel bangs)

869
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:48,994
- Harold Glotter,
Fallwell Real Estate.

870
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:51,496
- Well, I sure hope
you got a buyer.

871
00:43:51,496 --> 00:43:53,598
I haven't had so
much as a looky-loo.

872
00:43:53,598 --> 00:43:54,432
- Don't worry.

873
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:58,770
I have some wealthy
investor friends

874
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:00,171
that'd buy this
house in a minute,

875
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:03,308
that is, if you play
your cards right?

876
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:06,477
- Oh, honey, I'd do anything
to get rid of this rat trap.

877
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,014
- That's what I like,
a motivated seller.

878
00:44:09,948 --> 00:44:11,616
It's all a matter of technique.

879
00:44:11,616 --> 00:44:13,584
For starters, let's try and

880
00:44:15,286 --> 00:44:18,023
set the proper mood.
(seductive music)

881
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:19,190
- Oh, good idea.

882
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:21,026
I mean, the less
they see, the better.

883
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,830
- Then, it's simply a matter
of getting close to the buyer.

884
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:27,298
Tell them all about the
potential appreciation

885
00:44:27,298 --> 00:44:30,936
and guide him through
every nook and cranny,

886
00:44:30,936 --> 00:44:35,173
slowly unveil everything, from
the balcony to the basement,

887
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:36,541
one area at a time.

888
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:38,877
Then, when he's so enthralled
he's ready to burst,

889
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:41,379
you clench the deal!

890
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:44,282
Ow!

891
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:45,483
You'll be sorry.

892
00:44:45,483 --> 00:44:47,819
You'll never sell
this place without me.

893
00:44:47,819 --> 00:44:52,157
- Just because this house is
up for grabs doesn't mean I am.

894
00:44:52,157 --> 00:44:54,459
(Gonk barks)

895
00:44:54,459 --> 00:44:56,394
- Ah, get this dog off!

896
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,132
Get back, get outta here.

897
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:05,937
(melancholy music)

898
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:29,060
(phone rings)

899
00:45:34,833 --> 00:45:37,102
- "Calm down, Manny," she says.

900
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,104
I've got The Flamingo
breathing down my neck

901
00:45:39,104 --> 00:45:41,006
to cough up the dough
to hold that showroom,

902
00:45:41,006 --> 00:45:42,774
and you're telling
me to calm down.

903
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:45,143
- I told ya, I'll come
up with the money.

904
00:45:45,143 --> 00:45:49,214
Heck, I was just six inches
from selling this house today.

905
00:45:49,214 --> 00:45:52,517
- Look, kid, you better
get that money here pronto

906
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:54,552
or your through, do you hear me?

907
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:57,755
The only showroom you'll see
in Vegas'll have Toyotas in it!

908
00:45:58,689 --> 00:46:01,259
(Elvira sighs)

909
00:46:01,259 --> 00:46:04,095
(seductive music)

910
00:46:09,467 --> 00:46:14,005
- And now I understand she
is out looking for a job.

911
00:46:14,005 --> 00:46:16,707
(women chatter in high speed)

912
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:19,610
* And so in love as we

913
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:24,615
* And bewildered by
the world we see *

914
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:26,684
- [Billy] Let's go.

915
00:46:29,087 --> 00:46:31,823
* Only those in
love would know *

916
00:46:31,823 --> 00:46:36,828
* What a town
without pity can do *

917
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:42,367
* If we stop to
gaze upon a star *

918
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:48,173
* People talk about
how bad we are *

919
00:46:49,607 --> 00:46:52,077
- There's no book upstairs,
but I found these panties.

920
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:53,511
Try one, they're edible.

921
00:46:55,713 --> 00:47:00,051
* What a town
without pity can do *

922
00:47:00,051 --> 00:47:01,419
- Now, keep looking.

923
00:47:04,122 --> 00:47:07,025
(Gonk growls)

924
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:09,460
(Gonk barks)

925
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,469
(door creaks)

926
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,673
- Excuses, excuses.

927
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:25,010
We turned the place inside out.

928
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:26,811
- Yeah, and tell
him about the dog.

929
00:47:28,213 --> 00:47:29,847
Well, it must have been the
size of a water buffalo.

930
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,681
- Quiet!

931
00:47:33,251 --> 00:47:35,353
Now, listen to me
very carefully.

932
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,821
I want you to go
to the courthouse

933
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,890
and remove all the records
of the town ordinances

934
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,691
and bring them back to me.

935
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,460
Do you understand?

936
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,728
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

937
00:47:43,728 --> 00:47:45,063
- Then get out.

938
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:57,675
- Come on, you dummy.
- I told you, I'm going.

939
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:59,444
* Oh, it isn't very pretty

940
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:04,382
* What a town
without pity can do *

941
00:48:15,927 --> 00:48:17,162
- Ow!

942
00:48:17,162 --> 00:48:19,197
- Oh my gosh, Elvira.

943
00:48:19,197 --> 00:48:20,698
I'm sorry.

944
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:21,933
Are you all right?

945
00:48:21,933 --> 00:48:23,201
- Yeah, I think so.

946
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,569
- How's your head?

947
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:26,771
- I haven't had
any complaints yet.

948
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:27,605
- Excuse me?

949
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:31,276
- Oh, I think I'll live.

950
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:32,743
Believe me,

951
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,012
it's not the worst thing
that's happened to me today.

952
00:48:34,012 --> 00:48:35,046
I've been to every
place in this town

953
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:36,314
and no one will give me a job.

954
00:48:36,314 --> 00:48:39,317
It's like it's a
conspiracy or something.

955
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:42,520
- You know what your problem is?

956
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,022
Chastity Pariah.

957
00:48:44,022 --> 00:48:45,923
- (gasps) Oh, I though
that cleared up.

958
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,959
- No, Chastity Pariah.

959
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:49,160
She's the old biddy,

960
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:50,828
she's got the whole
town turned against you.

961
00:48:50,828 --> 00:48:54,899
- Oh, swell, so now no one'll
hire me and I'm flat busted.

962
00:48:56,067 --> 00:48:57,735
No, I mean I'm broke.

963
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:00,771
- I'd hire you if I could,

964
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,173
but I'm barely
making enough money

965
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:03,941
to stay in business as it is.

966
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,410
- Duh, not surprised.

967
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,145
I mean, who wants to pay

968
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:09,080
to see some quack
making duck calls?

969
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:12,950
And besides that, Bob, you
got an extra E in matinee.

970
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:13,818
- No, I don't.

971
00:49:13,818 --> 00:49:14,852
That's how you spell it.

972
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,288
- Uh, Bob, I'm in show business.

973
00:49:17,288 --> 00:49:19,190
I think I know how
to spell matinee.

974
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:24,395
- Well, I think it's
an awfully good idea.

975
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:32,570
(Chastity gasps)

976
00:49:34,505 --> 00:49:37,242
(Elvira screams)

977
00:49:42,347 --> 00:49:45,316
- Oh, Bob, how can
I ever repay you.

978
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,018
Here, let me try.

979
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:51,022
- That witch!

980
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:53,591
(tires squeal)

981
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,597
(ominous music)

982
00:50:00,765 --> 00:50:02,633
- I guess I'd better
get back to work.

983
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,102
Matinee's gonna start soon.

984
00:50:04,102 --> 00:50:07,305
- Oh, yeah, I can see
the crowds lining up now.

985
00:50:07,305 --> 00:50:09,674
Bobby, baby, you
are gonna go broke

986
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:11,476
showing turkeys like these.

987
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,145
- You got a better idea?

988
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:18,949
- It just so happens that I
have some of the classic films

989
00:50:18,949 --> 00:50:21,586
of all time in the
trunk of my car.

990
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:25,156
As a matter of fact...

991
00:50:26,091 --> 00:50:29,227
(thoughtful music)

992
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,896
(ominous music)

993
00:50:44,409 --> 00:50:47,212
(elevator creaks)

994
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,852
- Hmm, I don't trust that guy.

995
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:57,355
Who has an elevator
without a door?

996
00:50:57,355 --> 00:50:59,990
I mean, that's just an
accident waiting to happen.

997
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:01,392
But having said that,

998
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:03,861
isn't this movie the bomb?

999
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:07,598
Or sick, dope,

1000
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:10,901
whatever the hell they're
saying on TikTok these days?

1001
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:12,803
I haven't had so much fun

1002
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:15,440
since the last time
I crashed a funeral.

1003
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,475
Always a lot of laughs.

1004
00:51:17,475 --> 00:51:20,278
Okay, kids, guess
what time it is?

1005
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:27,017
That's right, it's Sack Time,

1006
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,019
Sack Time with Elvira,

1007
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,290
and I've got my rusty
old mail sack right here,

1008
00:51:32,290 --> 00:51:36,227
because I still receive so
many letters about this movie.

1009
00:51:36,227 --> 00:51:38,796
Why, there must be about
a million of them in here?

1010
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,133
Well, three.

1011
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:44,269
(cat yowls)

1012
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:46,871
Okay, let's see, what
have we got here?

1013
00:51:46,871 --> 00:51:48,038
First letter.

1014
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:51,742
Ooh, nice.

1015
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:55,780
Dear Elvira, did your movie
ever get any bad reviews?

1016
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,915
Signed, Curious.

1017
00:51:57,915 --> 00:51:59,850
Well, Curious, good question,

1018
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,086
but no, of course not.

1019
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:05,456
I mean, my movie is universally
adored, just like me.

1020
00:52:05,456 --> 00:52:08,326
Well, there may have been
a handful of comments

1021
00:52:08,326 --> 00:52:10,895
that were not bad, per se.

1022
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:14,131
More like misguided
or mean-spirited

1023
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,201
or just plain stupid.

1024
00:52:17,168 --> 00:52:18,636
Okay, let's see,

1025
00:52:18,636 --> 00:52:20,238
what, oh, here
we've got this one.

1026
00:52:20,238 --> 00:52:21,606
Yeah, let's see.

1027
00:52:21,606 --> 00:52:24,108
Alrighty, who's this from?

1028
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:28,846
Okay, dear Elvira,
your movie sucked.

1029
00:52:28,846 --> 00:52:31,882
There was no
character development.

1030
00:52:31,882 --> 00:52:34,885
Sincerely, Leonard Maltin.

1031
00:52:35,853 --> 00:52:36,787
Yo, Malt Balls,

1032
00:52:36,787 --> 00:52:38,623
better have your eyes examined,

1033
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:41,759
because I am one
developed character.

1034
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:45,696
All right, and the final letter.

1035
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:49,234
(laughs) Oh, golly, this is fun.

1036
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:54,472
Dear Elvira, your
movie was good.

1037
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:56,807
See, some people have taste.

1038
00:52:56,807 --> 00:53:01,712
Okay, all the kids in
my first grade class

1039
00:53:02,447 --> 00:53:03,481
think you are funny.

1040
00:53:04,515 --> 00:53:05,983
This is so cute.

1041
00:53:05,983 --> 00:53:08,519
XOX, Tommy.

1042
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:12,623
P.S., I saw your underpants.

1043
00:53:12,623 --> 00:53:14,158
Gosh darn it,

1044
00:53:14,158 --> 00:53:18,529
those darn kids just say the
darndest things, don't they?

1045
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,698
Well, back to the
action, darling,

1046
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,234
as "Mistress of the
Dark" continues.

1047
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,706
(ominous music)

1048
00:53:41,652 --> 00:53:46,090
(Vincent speaks in
foreign language)

1049
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,462
- He who holds the Book of Sight

1050
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:54,732
when the moon is
drained of all its light

1051
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:57,167
will then be ruler of the night,

1052
00:53:57,167 --> 00:53:58,969
master of the dark.

1053
00:54:01,439 --> 00:54:04,375
The lunar eclipse, Morgana,

1054
00:54:04,375 --> 00:54:07,278
it's less than a week away,

1055
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:11,115
when the moon is drained
of all its light.

1056
00:54:12,283 --> 00:54:17,221
(table rumbles)
(Morgana screams)

1057
00:54:17,221 --> 00:54:18,656
There's nothing you can do.

1058
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:22,960
You're dead, and I'm not.

1059
00:54:24,061 --> 00:54:27,398
(Vincent laughs evilly)

1060
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,274
(teens chatter)

1061
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:41,379
- Oh, there you are.

1062
00:54:41,379 --> 00:54:43,481
I have been looking
all over for you guys.

1063
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:45,716
You are not gonna
believe the good news.

1064
00:54:45,716 --> 00:54:49,354
Yours truly is hosting a
special midnight screening

1065
00:54:49,354 --> 00:54:53,290
at Bob's theater of one of
the worst movies ever made.

1066
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:54,725
I mean, it is bad.

1067
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:58,563
You know, like bad as in bad,

1068
00:54:58,563 --> 00:55:01,699
like I'm bad,
jammon, you know it.

1069
00:55:02,567 --> 00:55:04,268
Hey, what is this?

1070
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:06,371
"The Invasion of
the Body Snatchers"?

1071
00:55:06,371 --> 00:55:08,272
Two days ago, we
were bosom buddies.

1072
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:10,040
- [Robin] It's the principal.

1073
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,409
- You're darn right,
it's the principle.

1074
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:12,777
Friends oughta stick together.

1075
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:15,145
- No, I mean the
principal, Mr. Cobb.

1076
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,615
- He'd kill us if we
went to your show,

1077
00:55:17,615 --> 00:55:19,550
not to mention our parents.

1078
00:55:19,550 --> 00:55:21,552
- Kill your parents, too?

1079
00:55:21,552 --> 00:55:24,355
- No, our parents would never
let us stay out that late.

1080
00:55:25,289 --> 00:55:28,158
- Oh, I see.

1081
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,795
Well, last thing I want to do

1082
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,763
is get you guys in any trouble.

1083
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,466
I mean, so what if it blows

1084
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:37,502
my only chance at
making a living.

1085
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:40,705
I mean, that's not your problem.

1086
00:55:40,705 --> 00:55:43,107
And if I get so depressed,

1087
00:55:43,107 --> 00:55:46,644
I wind up hanging
myself in the oven,

1088
00:55:47,612 --> 00:55:49,614
hey, those are the breaks.

1089
00:55:52,917 --> 00:55:54,819
And if they ever ask about me,

1090
00:55:54,819 --> 00:55:57,422
tell them I was more than
just a great set of boobs.

1091
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:00,758
I was also an
incredible pair of legs.

1092
00:56:02,292 --> 00:56:05,162
And tell 'em, tell 'em that
I never turned down a friend,

1093
00:56:07,331 --> 00:56:10,568
well, I never turned down a
stranger, for that matter.

1094
00:56:10,568 --> 00:56:13,604
And tell 'em, tell 'em that
when all is said and done,

1095
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:17,575
I only asked that people
remember me by two simple words,

1096
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:23,380
any two, as long
as they're simple.

1097
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:27,985
(Elvira sobs)

1098
00:56:31,088 --> 00:56:34,391
- If we all decide to help
Elvira, what can Cobb do?

1099
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:35,760
- He can expel us all.

1100
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:40,931
- I don't know about the rest
of you, but I'll be there.

1101
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:43,534
(solemn music)

1102
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:45,570
- Me, too.

1103
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:48,405
- You can count on me.

1104
00:56:49,707 --> 00:56:51,175
- We're sorry, Elvira.

1105
00:56:51,175 --> 00:56:53,077
We'll all come to your show.

1106
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:59,283
- Great, 12 o'clock sharp,
be there or be square.

1107
00:57:01,952 --> 00:57:04,054
- At 10:30, my old man's out.

1108
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:05,422
- Mine's out, too.

1109
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:08,092
(teens whisper)

1110
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:18,168
(sneaky music)

1111
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:25,442
(water splashes)

1112
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:02,212
(fabric rips)

1113
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,838
- Oh, that looks great.

1114
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:28,839
- You really like it?

1115
00:58:28,839 --> 00:58:30,074
- Yeah!

1116
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:30,875
- Elvira, where
do you want this?

1117
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:32,109
- Just right up there.

1118
00:58:32,109 --> 00:58:32,943
- Okay.

1119
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:34,178
- What's the bucket for?

1120
00:58:34,178 --> 00:58:35,680
- Didn't I tell you?

1121
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:37,181
Oh, it's so cool.

1122
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:38,448
This is the part
that I ripped off,

1123
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,418
I mean, it was inspired
by "Flash Dance".

1124
00:58:41,418 --> 00:58:44,288
I reach up, I pull this rope,

1125
00:58:44,288 --> 00:58:49,126
and my entire body is
covered in gold glitter.

1126
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:50,494
Couldn't you die?

1127
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:51,962
- All right.

1128
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:54,431
- I'm telling you, that's
guaranteed standing ovulation.

1129
00:59:01,005 --> 00:59:03,407
(bells ding)

1130
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:08,145
(ominous music)

1131
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:15,720
(adventurous music)

1132
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,222
(teens cheer)

1133
00:59:23,594 --> 00:59:24,428
- You're late.

1134
00:59:25,529 --> 00:59:26,897
- Where the guy gets pureed.

1135
00:59:29,166 --> 00:59:30,567
Don't worry, they're Italians.

1136
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,270
They'll wind up making
a great marinara sauce.

1137
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,773
(teens laugh)

1138
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,244
- Robin?

1139
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,381
Is that you?

1140
00:59:46,283 --> 00:59:47,117
Man.

1141
00:59:48,552 --> 00:59:51,021
- This is where the heroine
gets grabbed by the tomatoes.

1142
00:59:51,021 --> 00:59:56,026
I can't look!

1143
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:11,041
(woman screams)

1144
01:00:11,041 --> 01:00:13,543
(teens laugh)

1145
01:00:19,516 --> 01:00:20,685
(Patty laughs)

1146
01:00:20,685 --> 01:00:22,486
- Boy, this ending's so bad,

1147
01:00:22,486 --> 01:00:23,420
the tomatoes oughta
start throwing

1148
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:25,022
rotten people at the screen.

1149
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:30,627
(teens cheer)

1150
01:00:36,734 --> 01:00:38,168
Okay, darlings, don't move,

1151
01:00:38,168 --> 01:00:39,970
because the best is yet to come.

1152
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:44,374
Ladies and Dobermans, it's
time for the grand finale.

1153
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:48,879
(upbeat music)

1154
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:00,791
* Just a steel town girl
on a Saturday night *

1155
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:03,660
* Looking for the
fight of her life *

1156
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,797
* In the real-time world,
no one sees her at all *

1157
01:01:06,797 --> 01:01:09,900
* They all say she's crazy

1158
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,737
* Locking rhythms to
the beat of her heart *

1159
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:15,706
* Changing movement into light

1160
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:18,743
* She has danced
into a danger zone *

1161
01:01:18,743 --> 01:01:23,180
* When the dancer
becomes the dance *

1162
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:25,916
* It can cut you like a knife

1163
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:29,286
* If the gift becomes the fire

1164
01:01:29,286 --> 01:01:34,191
* On the wire between
will and what will be *

1165
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:38,695
* She's a maniac,
maniac on the floor *

1166
01:01:40,197 --> 01:01:45,202
* And she's dancing
(Elvira gasps)

1167
01:01:51,776 --> 01:01:53,510
(Patty laughs)

1168
01:01:53,510 --> 01:01:55,012
Patty!

1169
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:58,182
(teens groan)

1170
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:01,085
(suspenseful music)

1171
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:05,622
Oh, I have never been so
humiliated in my entire life.

1172
01:02:06,857 --> 01:02:10,560
Just wait till I get
my hands on that Patty.

1173
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,730
I'm going to rip every
single bleached blonde hair

1174
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:16,100
out of her scalp,
gouge out her eyeballs,

1175
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,735
and use her head
for a bowling ball.

1176
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,906
I'm telling you, they are
not gonna get away with it.

1177
01:02:21,906 --> 01:02:24,741
That barf bag Chastity
blacklisted me out of a job,

1178
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:27,444
and that sleazoid of a
high school principal

1179
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,513
turning all the kids against me.

1180
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:32,449
And that bench-sniffing
real estate letch

1181
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,352
trying to get his
commission in the sack.

1182
01:02:35,352 --> 01:02:37,087
I'll get even with
every one of them

1183
01:02:37,087 --> 01:02:38,488
if it's the last thing I do.

1184
01:02:39,756 --> 01:02:42,492
(ominous music)

1185
01:02:45,796 --> 01:02:48,165
- What's that perfume
you're wearing?

1186
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:49,433
- Super unleaded.

1187
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:50,467
Don't smoke.

1188
01:02:57,374 --> 01:02:59,443
Well, here's to my big opening.

1189
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:03,981
(Robin giggles)
I mean, forget it.

1190
01:03:11,588 --> 01:03:13,790
Don't you kids think
it's past your bedtime?

1191
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,624
- Oh, heck no.

1192
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,093
I'm not tired, ouch.

1193
01:03:16,093 --> 01:03:17,527
- It is getting awfully late.

1194
01:03:19,396 --> 01:03:22,066
- Yeah, we'd better be going.

1195
01:03:22,066 --> 01:03:23,968
- Yep, well, see
you dudes tomorrow.

1196
01:03:25,702 --> 01:03:29,473
("The Star Spangled Banner")

1197
01:03:38,983 --> 01:03:41,651
(curious music)

1198
01:03:49,994 --> 01:03:53,230
(Bob breathes heavily)

1199
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:00,704
Ow!

1200
01:04:04,474 --> 01:04:05,943
There's the darn recipe book.

1201
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:07,844
How'd it get under there?

1202
01:04:12,549 --> 01:04:14,919
- (gasps) That reminds
me, I'm starving.

1203
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:17,187
- Me, too.

1204
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:20,557
- Uh, let's go get
something to eat.

1205
01:04:20,557 --> 01:04:22,626
There's an all night truck
stop out on the interstate.

1206
01:04:22,626 --> 01:04:24,861
- No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, Bob.

1207
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,231
I've got a better idea.

1208
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:29,399
Why don't you set the table

1209
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:32,836
while I see what I can
whip up in the kitchen.

1210
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:41,345
My aunt sure had
lousy penmanship.

1211
01:04:42,446 --> 01:04:44,048
I can't read a
word of this stuff.

1212
01:04:45,282 --> 01:04:46,516
It looks like it was written

1213
01:04:46,516 --> 01:04:47,918
in some kind of foreign
language or something.

1214
01:04:50,620 --> 01:04:52,522
Hey, wait, look at this.

1215
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,124
Adraka Kozerol.

1216
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:57,761
Kozerol, oh, casserole.

1217
01:04:57,761 --> 01:04:59,629
Hmm, that sounds good.

1218
01:04:59,629 --> 01:05:01,531
Okay, let's see, what
does it say here?

1219
01:05:01,531 --> 01:05:04,101
One edrazeba.

1220
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:06,603
Hmm?

1221
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:08,338
Wonder where's she keeps
the edrazeba around here.

1222
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,444
(curious music)

1223
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:17,948
Wow, this is some spice rack.

1224
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,585
Tramazol.

1225
01:05:21,585 --> 01:05:22,652
Folemgra.

1226
01:05:22,652 --> 01:05:23,487
Kuderox.

1227
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:26,323
Oh, here it is, edrezeba.

1228
01:05:33,363 --> 01:05:38,368
One edrezeba.

1229
01:05:40,570 --> 01:05:42,572
Okay, one half folemgra.

1230
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,979
Whoa, looks like
folemgra went bad.

1231
01:05:50,380 --> 01:05:52,616
I don't know, it says it's
good until June of next year.

1232
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:55,119
What the heck, I got
a cast-iron stomach.

1233
01:05:56,820 --> 01:05:58,322
Okay, then, let's see.

1234
01:05:58,322 --> 01:06:00,590
Two to three guletra, guletra.

1235
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,895
Uh, let's see, one kuderox.

1236
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:09,966
Kuderox, where could it be?

1237
01:06:11,868 --> 01:06:14,704
(mixture bubbles)

1238
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:18,808
Mm, doesn't smell too bad,

1239
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,777
but it looks like caca-doodoo.

1240
01:06:30,954 --> 01:06:33,457
(Elvira hums)

1241
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:42,599
(chips crunch)

1242
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,040
There, that's much better.

1243
01:06:58,248 --> 01:06:59,083
It's soup!

1244
01:07:03,387 --> 01:07:05,021
- Mm, smells great.

1245
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,223
What is it?

1246
01:07:06,223 --> 01:07:08,358
- Oh, just a little
something I conjured up.

1247
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:10,494
- Oh.

1248
01:07:12,929 --> 01:07:13,763
Allow me.

1249
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:16,433
- Thank you ever so.

1250
01:07:19,603 --> 01:07:22,572
Well, I hope you're hungry,

1251
01:07:22,572 --> 01:07:24,874
'cause here's dinner!

1252
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,743
(creature snarls)

1253
01:07:26,743 --> 01:07:30,480
(Elvira and Bob scream)

1254
01:07:30,480 --> 01:07:33,150
(ominous music)

1255
01:07:59,343 --> 01:08:02,112
(creature snarls)

1256
01:08:05,882 --> 01:08:08,285
The switch, Bob, the switch!

1257
01:08:08,285 --> 01:08:11,020
(disposal whirs)

1258
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,870
First time I was ever an
appetizer for the main course.

1259
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,004
- Where'd you learn how to cook?

1260
01:08:28,004 --> 01:08:29,539
- I didn't.

1261
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,241
I just followed the
directions in my aunt's,

1262
01:08:31,241 --> 01:08:33,177
Gonk, what are you doing?

1263
01:08:33,177 --> 01:08:34,278
Give me that cookbook!

1264
01:08:38,748 --> 01:08:39,649
Gonk, Gonk?

1265
01:08:41,718 --> 01:08:42,886
Gonk, you get back
here right now

1266
01:08:42,886 --> 01:08:44,888
or you are grounded
for one week.

1267
01:08:46,290 --> 01:08:47,123
Gonk!

1268
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:49,393
- [Bob] Gonk, come here.

1269
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:55,499
- (gasps) Deja vu.

1270
01:09:00,437 --> 01:09:03,072
(ominous music)

1271
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:06,310
- Wow.

1272
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:07,977
- Gonk?

1273
01:09:09,045 --> 01:09:10,880
Gonk, are you in here?

1274
01:09:15,852 --> 01:09:17,086
(Gonk barks)

1275
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:19,689
Gonk, you are a
very bad, bad dog.

1276
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,061
Oh, yuck, you
slobbered all over it.

1277
01:09:26,129 --> 01:09:27,764
(Gonk barks)

1278
01:09:27,764 --> 01:09:29,199
Now what do you want?

1279
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,737
(Gonk scratches)

1280
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:37,841
- I think he wants
you to open the trunk.

1281
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:40,244
- Why didn't you just say so?

1282
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:49,486
Wow, look at all this cool junk.

1283
01:09:51,488 --> 01:09:53,323
This could be you, Gonk.

1284
01:09:53,323 --> 01:09:55,592
(Gonk growls)

1285
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:59,095
Eww, think I used to
go out with this guy.

1286
01:10:05,302 --> 01:10:07,136
- Take a look at this.

1287
01:10:09,005 --> 01:10:10,006
- Think it's for me?

1288
01:10:11,007 --> 01:10:12,008
- Go ahead, open it.

1289
01:10:13,443 --> 01:10:14,411
- You open it.

1290
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,985
- Dearest, Elvira,

1291
01:10:21,985 --> 01:10:24,721
for all these years, I
protected you from the truth,

1292
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:26,723
but the time has now come

1293
01:10:26,723 --> 01:10:29,293
when your only
protection is the truth.

1294
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,261
- Say what?

1295
01:10:32,262 --> 01:10:33,096
Let me see this.

1296
01:10:34,664 --> 01:10:39,503
Your mother, Devana, was
an extraordinary woman.

1297
01:10:39,503 --> 01:10:42,071
She was the true
mistress of the dark,

1298
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:44,908
but her power did
not go unchallenged.

1299
01:10:44,908 --> 01:10:49,112
- [Morgana] For 300 years,
your great uncle, Vincent,

1300
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:50,113
coveted her dominion.

1301
01:10:52,416 --> 01:10:53,717
- 300?

1302
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:55,885
God, I hope I look that
good when I'm that old.

1303
01:10:57,354 --> 01:10:58,922
- [Morgana] He would have
destroyed you as he did her,

1304
01:10:58,922 --> 01:11:00,990
had I not sent you away.

1305
01:11:00,990 --> 01:11:02,292
I left you with all the power

1306
01:11:02,292 --> 01:11:04,060
you would need to
protect yourself

1307
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:06,129
and entrusted you to
my loyal familiar.

1308
01:11:06,129 --> 01:11:08,031
- What's that about a familiar?

1309
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,634
- Ah, haven't you ever seen
any old Roger Corman movies?

1310
01:11:10,634 --> 01:11:11,668
Every witch has one.

1311
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:13,136
They're like a,

1312
01:11:13,136 --> 01:11:14,938
like a pet that can change
into almost anything.

1313
01:11:14,938 --> 01:11:16,406
Where was I?

1314
01:11:16,406 --> 01:11:20,644
Oh, yeah, but it wasn't you
alone that I sought to protect,

1315
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:24,213
it was the book that
contained your mother's magic.

1316
01:11:25,849 --> 01:11:28,184
- [Morgana] Our enemy
is a formidable one.

1317
01:11:28,184 --> 01:11:30,053
Protect the book, Elvira,

1318
01:11:30,053 --> 01:11:32,922
and above all, keep
it from Vincent.

1319
01:11:32,922 --> 01:11:36,426
When the moon falls
under the earth's shadow,

1320
01:11:36,426 --> 01:11:40,029
remember, you carry
the power with you.

1321
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,433
Your loving aunt, Morgana.

1322
01:11:44,768 --> 01:11:45,669
- Too macabre.

1323
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,237
I mean, like, I knew
I was different,

1324
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:51,040
but I didn't think I was
quite that different.

1325
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:52,909
No wonder Vinny had
such a spaz attack

1326
01:11:52,909 --> 01:11:54,978
when I couldn't find the book.

1327
01:11:54,978 --> 01:11:56,480
- Yeah, and you heard
what your aunt said,

1328
01:11:56,480 --> 01:11:58,247
he can't get his hands on it.

1329
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,616
- No way he's getting it now.

1330
01:11:59,616 --> 01:12:01,117
And here I am,

1331
01:12:01,117 --> 01:12:03,620
knocking myself out to make
a living as a horror hostess,

1332
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,288
when I'm actually
descended from, like,

1333
01:12:05,288 --> 01:12:08,191
a major metaphysical celebrity.

1334
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:09,993
(pages rustle)

1335
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:12,396
All I have to do is just
find the right spell

1336
01:12:12,396 --> 01:12:15,131
and I can make the
money I need for Vegas.

1337
01:12:15,131 --> 01:12:17,434
I mean really make the money.

1338
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:21,104
- I don't think you should go
fooling with that book again.

1339
01:12:21,104 --> 01:12:22,038
- Wait, wait, look, Bob.

1340
01:12:22,038 --> 01:12:23,272
Here it is,

1341
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:25,141
Selzba Riki Moola.

1342
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,511
That's exactly what I
need, lots of moolah.

1343
01:12:28,712 --> 01:12:32,849
Okay, okay Selzba
Riki Moola Sheen.

1344
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:37,854
- Elvira, I don't think-
- Pasera floctum kezrah flome.

1345
01:12:38,455 --> 01:12:40,089
(house rattles)

1346
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:41,425
It's working, Bob!

1347
01:12:41,425 --> 01:12:42,492
It's working!

1348
01:12:46,763 --> 01:12:48,532
Bob, are you still here?

1349
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:49,466
- [Bob] Right here.

1350
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,807
- What is this?

1351
01:13:00,744 --> 01:13:02,712
Oh, why, Bob.

1352
01:13:05,081 --> 01:13:07,584
You know, Bob, I may be wrong,

1353
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:10,787
but I think that might've
been a love spell.

1354
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:11,621
- [Bob] Really?

1355
01:13:13,189 --> 01:13:18,027
- Oh, Bob, Bob. (moans)

1356
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:25,201
(Elvira screams)
(suspenseful music)

1357
01:13:29,473 --> 01:13:31,307
Hold me, Bob, hold me.

1358
01:13:39,649 --> 01:13:42,986
(lazy brass band music)

1359
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,565
- Stand up.

1360
01:13:58,468 --> 01:14:00,436
- Chastity, the picnic's
a great success.

1361
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,307
- Yes, I think it's something
we can all be proud of me for.

1362
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:11,781
(crowd applauds)

1363
01:14:13,583 --> 01:14:14,918
Come and get it!

1364
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,689
Now, you children, you're
acting wild animals.

1365
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:21,057
Get to the end of the line.

1366
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,629
It all looks so good.

1367
01:14:25,629 --> 01:14:27,831
I can't remember when
I've been this hungry.

1368
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:32,969
Ooh, Melody, I see you've
made your famous Tic Tac pie.

1369
01:14:40,109 --> 01:14:42,178
- (squeals) Bob,
what are you doing?

1370
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:43,580
You scared the hell out of me.

1371
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:44,480
- What's going on?

1372
01:14:45,682 --> 01:14:48,785
- Let's just say I'm
settling the score.

1373
01:14:48,785 --> 01:14:50,386
- [Bob] Oh, no.

1374
01:14:50,386 --> 01:14:52,421
- Well, it is a potluck,

1375
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:53,923
and believe me, when
they open that pot,

1376
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:56,225
they're going to need all
the luck they can get.

1377
01:14:58,795 --> 01:15:00,797
- Oh, I don't believe
I've had any of this.

1378
01:15:00,797 --> 01:15:02,766
- Revenge is better
than Christmas.

1379
01:15:03,900 --> 01:15:06,670
(dramatic music)

1380
01:15:09,773 --> 01:15:11,274
I don't get it, what happened.

1381
01:15:12,609 --> 01:15:14,678
- Looks like some
sort of casserole?

1382
01:15:18,147 --> 01:15:22,118
Mm, this is marvelous.

1383
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:23,587
I must get this recipe.

1384
01:15:30,627 --> 01:15:32,596
- Oh shoot, must
have screwed it up

1385
01:15:32,596 --> 01:15:34,063
when I substituted that folemgra

1386
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:35,498
with some Hamburger Helper.

1387
01:15:36,866 --> 01:15:39,502
- Oh, yes, thank
you for my drink.

1388
01:15:39,502 --> 01:15:42,438
There. (sighs)

1389
01:15:42,438 --> 01:15:45,208
(peaceful music)

1390
01:16:05,161 --> 01:16:07,263
(Chastity giggles)

1391
01:16:07,263 --> 01:16:08,932
I feel a little odd.

1392
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:14,470
Suddenly, it's very warm.

1393
01:16:14,470 --> 01:16:17,306
(seductive music)

1394
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:23,579
* I put a spell on you

1395
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:28,084
- Remind you of anything?

1396
01:16:30,286 --> 01:16:32,388
- Remind you of anything?

1397
01:16:35,191 --> 01:16:38,394
* Oh, I know you, I know

1398
01:16:38,394 --> 01:16:40,596
- Give me that, that's mine.

1399
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:41,430
All mine.

1400
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:46,703
(spoon scrapes)

1401
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:49,372
* I'm yours now

1402
01:16:51,741 --> 01:16:53,376
* I put a spell on you
- Oh, boy.

1403
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:55,078
Am I a horn dog?

1404
01:16:57,413 --> 01:17:02,351
* Because you're mine

1405
01:17:03,219 --> 01:17:05,121
- Excuse me, is this face taken.

1406
01:17:09,258 --> 01:17:10,860
(Elvira gasps)

1407
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:13,863
(upbeat jazz music)

1408
01:17:22,605 --> 01:17:24,741
- Come on, stud, let's boogie.

1409
01:17:24,741 --> 01:17:25,574
- Bob!

1410
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:37,653
- Hey, Lesley, let's mambo.

1411
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:49,132
- Charge!

1412
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:56,172
- That's an interesting dish.

1413
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,974
Where did you learn
how to make it?

1414
01:17:59,175 --> 01:18:00,877
- Oh, it's just an
old family recipe.

1415
01:18:02,545 --> 01:18:07,250
- All right, I'll give
you $500 for the book.

1416
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:10,854
- What, do I look like I
just fell off the tuna truck?

1417
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:13,289
The deal's off, Uncle.

1418
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:15,191
- You think you're
pretty clever, don't you?

1419
01:18:15,191 --> 01:18:17,861
Well, mark my words.

1420
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:20,463
I'll get you and
your little dog, too.

1421
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:22,866
- Ugh.

1422
01:18:26,970 --> 01:18:27,804
- Help.

1423
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,043
- No!

1424
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:35,945
Oh, you again.

1425
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:38,982
Do you always wear
the same dress?

1426
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:42,919
- No, sometimes I like to wear
something low-cut and sexy.

1427
01:18:45,254 --> 01:18:48,624
- Well, I guess in your
business, it pays to advertise.

1428
01:18:48,624 --> 01:18:50,760
(Elvira squeals)

1429
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:51,995
Come here, Bob.

1430
01:18:51,995 --> 01:18:54,063
Let me show you how
a real woman does it.

1431
01:18:56,432 --> 01:18:57,266
- Excuse me.

1432
01:18:58,802 --> 01:19:01,237
(punch thuds)

1433
01:19:05,141 --> 01:19:08,077
(Bob laughs)

1434
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,314
(striking guitar riff)

1435
01:19:12,315 --> 01:19:13,850
- You all saw him.

1436
01:19:13,850 --> 01:19:15,118
He attacked me in broad daylight

1437
01:19:15,118 --> 01:19:16,886
and he had his way with me.

1438
01:19:16,886 --> 01:19:17,821
- Me?

1439
01:19:17,821 --> 01:19:19,555
I barely got away with my life.

1440
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:22,491
You could have worn
out a mechanical bull.

1441
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,794
- Ooh, you're not gonna
get away with this,

1442
01:19:24,794 --> 01:19:26,629
you sex-addled maniac.

1443
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:29,198
I demand that the council
remove this pervert.

1444
01:19:29,198 --> 01:19:32,635
- I never laid a hand on
those sheep, so help me.

1445
01:19:32,635 --> 01:19:34,037
- Calvin was the one

1446
01:19:34,037 --> 01:19:35,704
who was painting everybody
with apple butter.

1447
01:19:35,704 --> 01:19:38,174
I was just an
innocent on-licker.

1448
01:19:38,174 --> 01:19:40,910
(council argues)

1449
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:43,146
- Silence!

1450
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:46,916
- Don't you see?

1451
01:19:49,085 --> 01:19:51,720
You're all playing
right into her hand.

1452
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:56,926
It's Elvira who is
responsible for all this.

1453
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:58,127
- Of course.

1454
01:19:58,127 --> 01:19:59,896
I should've known it
was that little harlot.

1455
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:03,732
- We oughta ride her outta
town on a big fat rail.

1456
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,401
- She might enjoy that too much.

1457
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,604
- There is a more
satisfactory solution.

1458
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:11,807
(ominous music)

1459
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,077
We can have her arrested.

1460
01:20:14,077 --> 01:20:16,445
- Arrested, on what charges?

1461
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:19,482
- It's so happens that
there is a law on the books

1462
01:20:19,482 --> 01:20:21,584
that dates back to
the Salem trials.

1463
01:20:22,718 --> 01:20:25,321
It's specifically
forbids, and I quote,

1464
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,456
any towns person from practicing

1465
01:20:27,456 --> 01:20:32,461
the ancient arts of
spellcasting, demonology,

1466
01:20:33,329 --> 01:20:35,731
alchemy, and conjuration.

1467
01:20:37,733 --> 01:20:41,370
The charge, my fellow
council members,

1468
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:44,540
is witchcraft.

1469
01:20:48,377 --> 01:20:50,646
(can clangs)

1470
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:52,081
- Let me outta here,
let me outta here!

1471
01:20:52,081 --> 01:20:53,816
- Pipe down in there.

1472
01:20:53,816 --> 01:20:55,751
- Hey, I've seen
"The People's Court".

1473
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,221
I'm entitled to one phone
call and a strip search.

1474
01:20:59,655 --> 01:21:01,190
- Well, there's the payphone
right across the street.

1475
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:02,391
What's the matter,

1476
01:21:02,391 --> 01:21:04,127
you forget where
you put your broom?

1477
01:21:04,127 --> 01:21:06,529
- Listen, fatso,
if I had a broom,

1478
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:08,164
I know exactly where I'd put it.

1479
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,302
Oh, this is swell.

1480
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:14,904
I can just hear Manny now.

1481
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:16,505
Hello Vegas, we
got a slight crimp

1482
01:21:16,505 --> 01:21:18,241
in the plans for the show.

1483
01:21:18,241 --> 01:21:20,709
Yeah, the star was
burned at the stake.

1484
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,245
- Elvira!

1485
01:21:22,245 --> 01:21:24,647
Great news, I got you the
best lawyer in the county.

1486
01:21:24,647 --> 01:21:26,582
He'll be here first
thing in the morning.

1487
01:21:27,583 --> 01:21:28,517
- Bob, in the morning?

1488
01:21:28,517 --> 01:21:29,752
First thing in the morning,

1489
01:21:29,752 --> 01:21:31,187
I'll be able to
fit in an ashtray.

1490
01:21:32,155 --> 01:21:33,856
You gotta get me outta here.

1491
01:21:33,856 --> 01:21:34,690
- But how?

1492
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:37,826
- The book, it's my only chance.

1493
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:39,162
Quick, run of the
house and get it.

1494
01:21:39,162 --> 01:21:40,463
- Okay.

1495
01:21:40,463 --> 01:21:41,464
- Oh, and Bob, wait!

1496
01:21:42,865 --> 01:21:44,233
- What?

1497
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,669
- I hid it under the
floorboard in the living room.

1498
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:47,436
- Okay.

1499
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:49,472
- Oh, and Bob!

1500
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:52,041
- What?

1501
01:21:52,041 --> 01:21:52,841
- Hurry!

1502
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:57,846
(suspenseful music)

1503
01:22:00,249 --> 01:22:01,717
- Hey, move.

1504
01:22:01,717 --> 01:22:02,885
Duck down low.

1505
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:09,225
(townspeople chatter)

1506
01:22:11,794 --> 01:22:14,930
(saw buzzes)

1507
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:15,764
Now.

1508
01:22:17,633 --> 01:22:20,036
(saw buzzes)

1509
01:22:21,437 --> 01:22:22,771
What are you whining about?

1510
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,273
I'm the one getting barbecued.

1511
01:22:25,608 --> 01:22:28,777
(Gonk barks)

1512
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:31,447
(ominous music)

1513
01:22:34,183 --> 01:22:35,618
Oh, sorry.

1514
01:22:36,719 --> 01:22:39,222
(Gonk growls)

1515
01:22:41,690 --> 01:22:44,960
(Bob taps floorboards)

1516
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:51,700
(suspenseful music)

1517
01:22:53,569 --> 01:22:55,538
- At last, it's mine.

1518
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:56,872
The power is mine!

1519
01:23:03,679 --> 01:23:07,350
(upbeat rock music)

1520
01:23:07,350 --> 01:23:10,586
- Come on, don't have
a conniption fit.

1521
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:22,965
Whoa, must have took too
much antacid in the sixties.

1522
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:26,702
- [Townspeople] Two,
four, six, eight,

1523
01:23:26,702 --> 01:23:28,871
who do we incinerate?

1524
01:23:28,871 --> 01:23:30,806
Elvira, Elvira, Elvira!

1525
01:23:34,677 --> 01:23:37,080
(saw buzzes)

1526
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,721
- Thank goodness, padre.

1527
01:23:45,721 --> 01:23:47,823
- I am here to
save you, my child.

1528
01:23:47,823 --> 01:23:49,392
- At last, someone that
can talk some sense

1529
01:23:49,392 --> 01:23:50,593
into these people.

1530
01:23:52,828 --> 01:23:57,166
- Lord, save this
wretched creature's soul,

1531
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:02,105
even though her creamy, white
flesh will burn and sizzle.

1532
01:24:03,972 --> 01:24:06,875
(ceiling clatters)

1533
01:24:12,248 --> 01:24:14,583
- Well, isn't that convenient?

1534
01:24:18,087 --> 01:24:19,922
- Thanks for trying, you guys.

1535
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:22,225
- [Robin] Elvira!

1536
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:27,563
(upbeat rock music)

1537
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:38,874
- Gonk?

1538
01:24:40,309 --> 01:24:41,177
Is that you, boy?

1539
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,353
(Gonk barks)

1540
01:24:50,353 --> 01:24:51,387
Good work, Gonk.

1541
01:24:52,255 --> 01:24:53,722
- [Townspeople] Burn the witch,

1542
01:24:53,722 --> 01:24:54,923
burn the witch, burn the witch,

1543
01:24:54,923 --> 01:24:56,825
burn the witch, burn the witch!

1544
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,627
- Do you smoke?

1545
01:24:58,627 --> 01:25:00,363
- Guess we'll find
out soon enough.

1546
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:02,765
- [Townspeople] Burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1547
01:25:02,765 --> 01:25:05,968
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1548
01:25:05,968 --> 01:25:09,505
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1549
01:25:09,505 --> 01:25:12,541
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1550
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:17,112
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.

1551
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:21,284
- [Chaplain] The flames
that will soon engulf her!

1552
01:25:22,918 --> 01:25:24,653
- Oh, no, you're not
gonna believe this.

1553
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:25,721
I left my oven on.

1554
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:26,822
I'll just be a minute.

1555
01:25:27,990 --> 01:25:30,426
- [Townspeople] Burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1556
01:25:30,426 --> 01:25:33,596
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1557
01:25:33,596 --> 01:25:35,364
burn the witch, burn the witch,

1558
01:25:35,364 --> 01:25:37,966
burn the witch, burn the witch.

1559
01:25:40,336 --> 01:25:41,737
- Any last words?

1560
01:25:41,737 --> 01:25:42,705
- Just one, help!

1561
01:25:46,209 --> 01:25:47,776
- [Townspeople] Burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1562
01:25:47,776 --> 01:25:50,346
burn the witch, burn the witch.

1563
01:25:51,914 --> 01:25:52,748
- Hold it.

1564
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:54,149
Hold it down.

1565
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:55,218
Quiet, quiet!

1566
01:25:58,887 --> 01:26:01,690
And now, by the
power vested in me

1567
01:26:01,690 --> 01:26:04,293
by the sovereign state
of Massachusetts,

1568
01:26:04,293 --> 01:26:08,631
I do hereby pronounce sentence
on Elvira, the prisoner,

1569
01:26:08,631 --> 01:26:11,834
death by fire.

1570
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:14,670
(suspenseful music)

1571
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:15,638
- Hold it, Sheriff.

1572
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:18,674
What you're doing is wrong.

1573
01:26:19,575 --> 01:26:21,109
- Patty?

1574
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,346
- It'll catch faster if you
light it in several places.

1575
01:26:25,448 --> 01:26:26,449
- Patty, no!

1576
01:26:29,785 --> 01:26:32,488
- We oughta have one
of these every year.

1577
01:26:33,489 --> 01:26:35,591
- Burn in hell, witch!

1578
01:26:35,591 --> 01:26:36,925
- Patty!

1579
01:26:36,925 --> 01:26:40,396
(townspeople cheer)

1580
01:26:40,396 --> 01:26:42,498
- [Townspeople] Burn the
witch, burn the witch,

1581
01:26:42,498 --> 01:26:46,335
burn the witch, burn the
witch, burn the witch.

1582
01:26:46,335 --> 01:26:48,504
- [Elvira] Somebody, help!

1583
01:26:49,972 --> 01:26:50,906
- Burn her!

1584
01:26:51,807 --> 01:26:53,376
- Bye, kids.

1585
01:26:53,376 --> 01:26:54,277
It's been swell.

1586
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:57,212
Just send my ashes to Las Vegas.

1587
01:26:58,113 --> 01:26:59,147
- Let me through!

1588
01:27:01,917 --> 01:27:02,751
Elvira!

1589
01:27:09,625 --> 01:27:10,893
- Hi, Bob.

1590
01:27:10,893 --> 01:27:14,263
- Patty, you're not
a very nice person.

1591
01:27:15,431 --> 01:27:19,302
- [Townspeople] Burn the
witch, burn the witch!

1592
01:27:22,671 --> 01:27:23,572
(Gonk barks)

1593
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:24,407
- Gonk?

1594
01:27:30,513 --> 01:27:34,750
- [Morgana] Remember, you
carry the power with you.

1595
01:27:39,422 --> 01:27:40,356
- The ring.

1596
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:56,271
(thunder rumbles)

1597
01:27:57,373 --> 01:27:59,875
(crowd yells)

1598
01:28:16,859 --> 01:28:18,160
- Are you all right?

1599
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:22,398
(romantic music)

1600
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:29,905
- Look, the lunar eclipse.

1601
01:28:31,874 --> 01:28:34,309
Remember, your aunt's letter?

1602
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:36,779
When the moon falls
under the earth's shadow.

1603
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:39,214
- Yeah, so?

1604
01:28:39,214 --> 01:28:40,649
- Vincent's got the book.

1605
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:44,787
(ominous music)

1606
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:50,926
(thunder rumbles)

1607
01:28:53,295 --> 01:28:54,129
- Elvira!

1608
01:28:58,233 --> 01:28:59,067
Elvira!

1609
01:29:05,974 --> 01:29:08,477
- Oh, you tricky little devil!

1610
01:29:12,381 --> 01:29:13,215
- Oh!

1611
01:29:14,417 --> 01:29:16,852
Vincent, remember us?

1612
01:29:16,852 --> 01:29:18,654
We're on your side.

1613
01:29:18,654 --> 01:29:19,488
- Swine.

1614
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:35,237
- Stay back.

1615
01:29:41,777 --> 01:29:44,012
(Bob grunts)

1616
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:45,948
- Sick 'im, Gonk!

1617
01:29:45,948 --> 01:29:48,984
(Gonk growls)

1618
01:29:48,984 --> 01:29:51,687
(Vincent growls)

1619
01:29:51,687 --> 01:29:54,356
(Gonk whimpers)

1620
01:29:56,158 --> 01:29:57,359
Don't make me use this.

1621
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:06,201
- (laughs) The amulet could
not protect your mother,

1622
01:30:06,201 --> 01:30:08,737
and it won't save you.

1623
01:30:08,737 --> 01:30:12,374
Kaldozar ipsole.

1624
01:30:14,242 --> 01:30:17,312
(bricks shatter)

1625
01:30:17,312 --> 01:30:19,448
- Ah, so you want
to play rough, hey?

1626
01:30:19,448 --> 01:30:20,483
Well, take this.

1627
01:30:27,122 --> 01:30:27,956
What?

1628
01:30:35,498 --> 01:30:38,501
(suspenseful music)

1629
01:30:49,845 --> 01:30:52,114
- You cannot escape
me, daughter of Devana.

1630
01:30:53,315 --> 01:30:55,584
I shall destroy
you as I did her.

1631
01:30:59,021 --> 01:31:00,923
(gun cocks)

1632
01:31:00,923 --> 01:31:04,026
(sultry guitar riff)

1633
01:31:06,729 --> 01:31:07,863
- You looking for me?

1634
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:11,667
(gun fires)

1635
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:18,907
- Did you think you could
stop me with your toys?

1636
01:31:20,408 --> 01:31:22,911
- No, but I figured
it'd be worth a shot.

1637
01:31:22,911 --> 01:31:23,746
Look!

1638
01:31:27,115 --> 01:31:30,452
(Vincent laughs evilly)

1639
01:31:44,733 --> 01:31:47,570
(thunder rumbles)

1640
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:13,061
- Cosa terra obtan!

1641
01:32:16,599 --> 01:32:19,534
- Sure, that's easy
for you to say.

1642
01:32:20,703 --> 01:32:23,471
(shoe whips)

1643
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:26,208
(Vincent groans)

1644
01:32:27,643 --> 01:32:30,412
(magic crackles)

1645
01:32:40,723 --> 01:32:43,391
(lock shatters)

1646
01:32:47,062 --> 01:32:48,163
- That hurts!

1647
01:32:51,700 --> 01:32:54,536
(thunder rumbles)

1648
01:32:56,805 --> 01:32:57,773
- Now, baby.

1649
01:33:01,744 --> 01:33:06,749
Hey, we have a little
unfinished business.

1650
01:33:08,216 --> 01:33:11,486
- Yeah, well, I think
we can do business.

1651
01:33:12,721 --> 01:33:14,156
Yeah, sure, I can dig it.

1652
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,825
I'm cool, bro.

1653
01:33:16,825 --> 01:33:18,460
You know what it is?

1654
01:33:18,460 --> 01:33:20,195
Where it's at?

1655
01:33:20,195 --> 01:33:22,264
- I'll show you where it's at.

1656
01:33:22,264 --> 01:33:25,000
(Travis screams)

1657
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:49,725
(wall shatters)
(suspenseful music)

1658
01:33:53,428 --> 01:33:56,098
(Vincent yells)

1659
01:34:04,506 --> 01:34:06,675
- I am master of the dark!

1660
01:34:09,011 --> 01:34:11,780
- And I'll see
you in hell first.

1661
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:27,329
(fire crackles)

1662
01:34:40,743 --> 01:34:43,746
(floorboard smacks)

1663
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:51,086
(Vincent groans)

1664
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,295
- And now, Elvira, you die.

1665
01:35:04,666 --> 01:35:07,335
(Vincent yells)

1666
01:35:33,528 --> 01:35:37,800
- [Morgana] Remember, you
carry the power with you.

1667
01:35:49,444 --> 01:35:52,047
(somber music)

1668
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:00,823
- So, what did the
insurance guy say?

1669
01:36:02,690 --> 01:36:05,427
- My policy doesn't
cover acts of demons.

1670
01:36:08,196 --> 01:36:10,198
- Well, at least you
still got the ring.

1671
01:36:11,566 --> 01:36:12,767
- Yeah, but the only thing

1672
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:14,803
I can get it to do
anymore is look cheap.

1673
01:36:18,106 --> 01:36:19,641
- Gosh, Elvira, I'm sorry.

1674
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:23,211
I know you had your heart
set on playing Las Vegas.

1675
01:36:25,247 --> 01:36:27,983
- I'm just not the kind of
girl whose dreams come true.

1676
01:36:29,384 --> 01:36:30,853
I do better on nightmares.

1677
01:36:35,057 --> 01:36:37,059
- I wish there was
something I could do.

1678
01:36:39,327 --> 01:36:41,329
- Yeah, don't worry
about me, Bob.

1679
01:36:41,329 --> 01:36:43,966
I'm like fake fruit, I
don't bruise that easy.

1680
01:36:46,768 --> 01:36:48,770
- [Man] There he is, up there.

1681
01:36:48,770 --> 01:36:51,907
(townspeople chatter)

1682
01:36:51,907 --> 01:36:54,109
- Uh-oh, here comes
the lynch mob.

1683
01:36:54,109 --> 01:36:55,610
Hey, take it easy, take
it easy, I'm leaving.

1684
01:36:55,610 --> 01:36:56,912
- We don't want you to go.

1685
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,983
- This is our way of saying
we were wrong about you

1686
01:37:00,983 --> 01:37:02,617
and we're sorry.

1687
01:37:02,617 --> 01:37:03,852
- Elvira, you're the best thing

1688
01:37:03,852 --> 01:37:05,787
that ever happened to our town.

1689
01:37:05,787 --> 01:37:07,589
- You've touched
a part of my son

1690
01:37:07,589 --> 01:37:10,158
that nobody's ever
touched before.

1691
01:37:10,158 --> 01:37:12,294
- I wish.
(townspeople laugh)

1692
01:37:12,294 --> 01:37:13,761
- As long as you're in Fallwell,

1693
01:37:13,761 --> 01:37:16,798
you will always have a
free room at the Cozy Cot.

1694
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,769
- Now, wait just
a minute, Lesley.

1695
01:37:21,769 --> 01:37:23,771
- Shut up, you old bag.

1696
01:37:23,771 --> 01:37:25,840
(townspeople laugh)

1697
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:28,243
(horn blows)

1698
01:37:29,878 --> 01:37:31,113
- Birds of a feather!

1699
01:37:31,113 --> 01:37:32,580
- Well, I finally
got it running.

1700
01:37:33,681 --> 01:37:34,516
- Great!

1701
01:37:36,084 --> 01:37:38,086
At least now, I'll
have a place to live,

1702
01:37:39,521 --> 01:37:40,956
but I still don't know how
I'm gonna pay ya for it.

1703
01:37:40,956 --> 01:37:43,191
- Don't worry, we'll
work out something.

1704
01:37:44,893 --> 01:37:45,727
- Elvira.

1705
01:37:48,063 --> 01:37:52,067
I'm sorry that I set you
on fire and everything,

1706
01:37:53,335 --> 01:37:56,771
and I hope there are
no hard feelings.

1707
01:37:56,771 --> 01:37:58,706
- Don't worry, she's
bigger than that.

1708
01:37:59,574 --> 01:38:01,443
- Yeah, a lot bigger.

1709
01:38:03,211 --> 01:38:05,347
- Elvira, I've got
some important papers

1710
01:38:05,347 --> 01:38:07,115
that you're gonna have to sign.

1711
01:38:07,115 --> 01:38:09,952
With your uncle gone, you're
the only heir to his estate.

1712
01:38:11,286 --> 01:38:12,354
- I am?

1713
01:38:12,354 --> 01:38:14,189
- Not an inconsiderable
one at that.

1714
01:38:16,024 --> 01:38:17,592
- Las Vegas!

1715
01:38:17,592 --> 01:38:19,127
- Elvira, that's fantastic.

1716
01:38:19,962 --> 01:38:22,164
- Las Vegas!

1717
01:38:22,164 --> 01:38:22,998
Las Vegas!

1718
01:38:24,432 --> 01:38:25,267
Las Vegas!

1719
01:38:30,005 --> 01:38:32,174
- [Announcer] Ladies

1720
01:38:32,174 --> 01:38:35,877
The Flamingo Hotel

1725
01:38:53,661 --> 01:38:57,399
* In a little song and dance

1726
01:39:18,686 --> 01:39:22,524
* Well, if you're

1727
01:39:22,524 --> 01:39:26,228

1728
01:39:26,228 --> 01:39:29,697

* Here I am

1730
01:39:33,901 --> 01:39:37,405
* I don't do what
the good girls do *

1731
01:39:37,405 --> 01:39:41,476
* Bad dreams really
do come true *

1732
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:54,422
* Here I am

1733
01:39:56,924 --> 01:39:59,094

* You might get motion
sickness or a heart attack *

1735
01:40:00,862 --> 01:40:02,797
* I can really rap up with
the swelling in your pocket *

1736
01:40:02,797 --> 01:40:04,566
* Make your eyeballs drop
right out of their socket *

1737
01:40:04,566 --> 01:40:06,501
* I'm rough, I'm tough,
I'm woman enough *

1738
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:08,470
* So get ready, I'm
gonna do my stuff *

1739
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:09,537
* I can take, I can shake it

1740
01:40:09,537 --> 01:40:10,838
* I can cook it, I can bake it

1741
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:12,340
* If I don't have the
recipe, I'll fake it *

1742
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,941
* I'm a volcano
that's ready to blow *

1743
01:40:13,941 --> 01:40:18,946
* Look out, y'all,
'cause here I go *

1744
01:40:22,150 --> 01:40:24,752

(Gonk barks)

1747
01:41:12,434 --> 01:41:14,836
(Bob cheers)

1748
01:41:22,377 --> 01:41:23,211
For me?

1749
01:41:36,491 --> 01:41:37,992
Unpleasant dreams.

1750
01:41:41,028 --> 01:41:44,031
(upbeat rock music)

1751
01:44:21,222 --> 01:44:25,893
(sniffles) Oh, that
movie gets me every time.

1752
01:44:25,893 --> 01:44:29,364
It is just such a
timeless classic,

1753
01:44:29,364 --> 01:44:31,265
just like "Wizard of Oz".

1754
01:44:31,265 --> 01:44:33,501
And when you think about it,

1755
01:44:33,501 --> 01:44:36,971
those two stories
are exactly the same,

1756
01:44:36,971 --> 01:44:39,106
minus the flying monkeys.

1757
01:44:39,106 --> 01:44:40,708
Innocent girl from out of town

1758
01:44:40,708 --> 01:44:42,877
shows up with her
yappy little dog,

1759
01:44:42,877 --> 01:44:44,812
makes some likely friends,

1760
01:44:44,812 --> 01:44:47,715
triumphs over evil
and twirls tassels.

1761
01:44:48,916 --> 01:44:51,519
Oh wait, Dorothy, didn't
twirl tassels, did she?

1762
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:56,290
Well, anyway, remember what
Dorothy said she learned in Oz?

1763
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:59,093
That if she ever went looking
for her heart's desire,

1764
01:44:59,093 --> 01:45:02,229
she wouldn't look any further
than her own backyard,

1765
01:45:02,229 --> 01:45:06,434
because if it wasn't there, she
never lost it to begin with.

1766
01:45:06,434 --> 01:45:09,103
Well watching "Elvira,
Mistress of the Dark" just now,

1767
01:45:09,103 --> 01:45:11,706
I had the same sort of epiphany.

1768
01:45:11,706 --> 01:45:13,775
You're gonna have to
look that one up, bucko.

1769
01:45:13,775 --> 01:45:17,679
And it taught me some
valuable lessons.

1770
01:45:17,679 --> 01:45:21,015
I learned that friendship
is like cheese.

1771
01:45:21,015 --> 01:45:24,419
The longer it sits around,
the stronger it gets,

1772
01:45:24,419 --> 01:45:27,755
and that friends are
like cheap toupees,

1773
01:45:27,755 --> 01:45:31,359
you've gotta hang on to
them when things get stormy.

1774
01:45:31,359 --> 01:45:34,562
But most of all, I learned
that you can search

1775
01:45:34,562 --> 01:45:38,400
and search the wide world
over, but in the end,

1776
01:45:38,400 --> 01:45:40,101
your own backyard is

1777
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:44,305
right behind your house.

1778
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,174
Okay, darling, stay glued.

1779
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:49,811
There's lots more chills,
spills, and thrills

1780
01:45:49,811 --> 01:45:53,147
coming right up on
"Elvira's 40th Anniversary,

1781
01:45:53,147 --> 01:45:57,419
Very Scary, Very
Special Special".

1782
01:45:57,419 --> 01:45:59,654
- [Announcer] Coming
up, Elvira checks out

1783
01:45:59,654 --> 01:46:01,656
"House on Haunted Hill".

1784
01:46:01,656 --> 01:46:05,960
You don't want to miss
it. (laughs evilly)
