because I was
too busy running.

00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,058
She couldn't have looked
like my mother

is very fat.

Take this, weirdo twerp!

77
00:03:12,982 --> 00:03:14,540
Fall out!

Nun: Ten-hut!
Battaglia!

79
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:27,289
On your feet!

80
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,402
Chins up, shoulders back,
and...

81
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:37,296
. Catholic school
is where I am...

We love

87
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:49,282
Catholic school
is where I am.

88
00:03:49,216 --> 00:03:51,217
Catholic school
is where I am.

89
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:53,137
Catholic school
will make me a man.

90
00:03:53,057 --> 00:03:55,225
Catholic school
will make me a man.

91
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:57,071
Father, Son
and Holy Ghost.

92
00:03:56,994 --> 00:04:02,192
We love St. Anthony
the most...

93
00:04:29,515 --> 00:04:31,883
Mother Superior:
Mr. Battaglia...

94
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:33,488
you know if you were
more normal,

95
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,587
we wouldn't have to go
through this so often.

96
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,236
Why can't you act like
all the other little boys?

97
00:04:39,084 --> 00:04:40,381
Huh?

98
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:44,821
Then you wouldn't have
so many enemies.

99
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:47,949
You might make
some friends.

100
00:04:47,824 --> 00:04:49,157
So here we are,

101
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,905
once again faced with
the unsavory prospect

102
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,395
of having to call
your mother.

103
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,818
I don't like calling
your mother, Bruno.

104
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,815
To tell you the truth,

105
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,167
I don't really like
your mother.

106
00:05:03,988 --> 00:05:06,289
Why do the two of you
always insist

107
00:05:06,196 --> 00:05:12,395
on inspiring such
heartfelt disdain?

108
00:05:14,038 --> 00:05:18,667
Can I use the bathroom?

109
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:23,212
All right.

110
00:05:23,225 --> 00:05:24,886
Consolata!

111
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,583
Yes?

112
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:28,910
Have you finished
typing up the memos

113
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:30,592
for the other sisters
regarding the spelling bee?

114
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:31,723
I'm almost done.

115
00:05:31,675 --> 00:05:35,177
Type faster.
And get Bruno a hall pass.

116
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,970
And when Mrs. Battaglia
gets here,

117
00:05:36,893 --> 00:05:38,794
I don't want her
within 50 feet of my office!

118
00:05:38,717 --> 00:05:40,651
This time I mean it!

119
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,507
Consolata: But I can't
stop her from--

120
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,331
- Understand?
- But--

121
00:05:44,254 --> 00:05:47,590
That'll be all, sister!

122
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:48,945
Come on.

123
00:05:51,488 --> 00:05:57,289
Shut the door
on your way out, sister.

124
00:05:57,058 --> 00:06:00,727
Oh, Poppy, Poppy.

125
00:06:00,578 --> 00:06:02,412
You're the Pope.

126
00:06:02,339 --> 00:06:05,842
You're the top banana...

127
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,531
La da da.

128
00:06:07,525 --> 00:06:12,893
Da da da da da da...

129
00:06:24,041 --> 00:06:26,409
Bruno: Sometimes when
I closed my eyes,

130
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,681
I could pretend
I was in Heaven.

131
00:06:28,586 --> 00:06:30,320
I could pretend
I was with two angels,

132
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,251
and they were my parents.

133
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:35,039
We held hands,
we laughed and had fun.

134
00:06:34,923 --> 00:06:38,659
But then the father angel
let go.

135
00:06:38,508 --> 00:06:40,610
Why did he go, Mom?

136
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:42,254
Mom?

137
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:43,982
Mom!

138
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:47,385
Woman: Bruno, where are you?

139
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:49,248
Come on, baby,
let's go.

140
00:06:49,168 --> 00:06:53,729
Mommy's got bingo tonight,
come on.

141
00:07:10,453 --> 00:07:12,421
Sister?

142
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:15,107
- What's wrong, Bruno?
- I don't know.

143
00:07:14,998 --> 00:07:16,699
- Where's your mother?
- I don't know.

144
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,331
Did everything come out
all right?

145
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:19,763
- No.
- It didn't?

146
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:21,037
- No.
- Well, what's the matter?

147
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,452
It's all plugged up
and cloistered.

148
00:07:23,352 --> 00:07:25,320
Consolata: Oh, my God, where?
Show me.

149
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:27,475
Here and here.

150
00:07:27,385 --> 00:07:29,320
My God, you've gotta
see the nurse.

151
00:07:29,242 --> 00:07:34,372
Don't move,
I'll get the pass.

152
00:07:40,797 --> 00:07:46,894
You can't go in there!

153
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:51,124
Angela, if you threaten
me again,

154
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,809
I'm calling the police.

155
00:07:52,736 --> 00:07:55,871
Then do something more about
those kids picking on my son.

156
00:07:55,745 --> 00:07:57,713
I'm sorry, but I've done
everything I can.

157
00:07:57,634 --> 00:07:59,969
If Bruno wants people
to stop picking on him,

158
00:07:59,874 --> 00:08:02,275
he's gonna have to take matters
into his own hands!

159
00:08:02,179 --> 00:08:04,380
How is he supposed
to do that?

160
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:07,694
By not acting like
such a little sissy!

161
00:08:07,556 --> 00:08:10,791
How could you be
so friggin' heartless?

162
00:08:10,661 --> 00:08:13,763
I'm not heartless,
I'm a Catholic nun!

163
00:08:13,637 --> 00:08:16,806
You don't have
a Catholic bone

164
00:08:16,678 --> 00:08:19,280
- in your goddamned body.
- Is that a threat?

165
00:08:19,175 --> 00:08:21,409
You're friggin' right,
it's a threat.

166
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,653
That's it.
I'm calling the cops.

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,068
If I were you, I'd do more
than call the cops.

168
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:27,237
I'd get on this big,
black phone of yours,

169
00:08:27,145 --> 00:08:30,547
and I'd call the Pope!

170
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,377
Ta-ta.

171
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:39,384
Angela: Let's go.

172
00:08:39,533 --> 00:08:41,000
Girl: Bye.

173
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:51,791
Girl: Here she comes.

174
00:08:55,313 --> 00:08:58,648
Boy: She's so fat.

175
00:08:58,513 --> 00:09:00,448
Bruno: Sometimes I prayed
for a good angel

176
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,637
to come
and take me away.

177
00:09:02,546 --> 00:09:06,950
But no matter how hard
I prayed, it never happened.

178
00:09:06,772 --> 00:09:11,230
Boy: Hey, Bruno,
are you a pussy?

179
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:17,701
- Boys: Pussy, pussy...
- Is that your mother?

180
00:09:17,622 --> 00:09:19,089
She looks like a house.

181
00:09:19,031 --> 00:09:20,632
Come on, Mom.

182
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,067
"Come on, Mom."

183
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:23,608
- Please.
- Ignore them.

184
00:09:23,544 --> 00:09:25,678
Boys:
"Please. Ignore them."

185
00:09:25,592 --> 00:09:26,826
Little minds, little bodies.

186
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:30,905
Boys:
"Little minds, little bodies."

187
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:38,817
- Let's go, Mom.
- Look at her waddle.

188
00:09:43,005 --> 00:09:44,872
Let's watch the car tilt.

189
00:09:44,797 --> 00:09:49,201
Let's see if it can move
with all that weight in it.

190
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:53,259
Let's watch the ties pop.

191
00:09:53,088 --> 00:09:59,480
She's going backwards!
The fat fuck can't even drive.

192
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:05,085
Holy shit, run!

193
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:09,239
Run!
Get out of the way!

194
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,242
Boy: Shit,
that fat lady is crazy.

195
00:10:18,087 --> 00:10:22,955
Boy:
Wait till tomorrow, Bruno!

196
00:10:30,634 --> 00:10:32,668
So, how was school today?

197
00:10:32,586 --> 00:10:33,848
Fine.

198
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,646
Let's go find some beauty.

199
00:10:51,535 --> 00:10:53,230
Okay.

200
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:57,444
Woman: Coronation Pink.

201
00:10:57,361 --> 00:11:00,897
It just came in today.

202
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:03,055
What do you say, Ange,
you want to give it a shot?

203
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:03,895
Okay.

204
00:11:06,356 --> 00:11:10,759
Woman: Oh, my God,
that is so you.

205
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,881
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

206
00:11:12,789 --> 00:11:13,881
So,

207
00:11:13,909 --> 00:11:15,910
how's the dress business
treating you?

208
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:18,699
I've got three due by Friday.
I haven't started one.

209
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,817
Really?
Oh, look--

210
00:11:20,727 --> 00:11:23,930
we have lipstick too,
that matches. Coronation Pink.

211
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,067
Look at this.
Isn't it a beautiful color?

212
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,746
And it comes in a nice,
gold tone compact

213
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:33,063
that's all faceted.
I just love facets, don't you?

214
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:34,923
And we have
matching nail polish.

215
00:11:34,843 --> 00:11:36,510
Give me your hand.

216
00:11:36,443 --> 00:11:38,845
Oh, no, I don't want
to ruin your manicure.

217
00:11:38,748 --> 00:11:40,148
Don't want to ruin
mine, either.

218
00:11:40,092 --> 00:11:44,459
Here, kid.
How about it?

219
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,371
Guess who came in
this morning?

220
00:11:46,302 --> 00:11:47,360
Who?

221
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,090
A certain tramp...

222
00:11:49,022 --> 00:11:51,924
who happens to be dating
your ex-husband.

223
00:11:51,807 --> 00:11:55,377
- H mmm. She buy anything?
- She sure did.

224
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,099
What'd she get?

225
00:11:56,064 --> 00:11:57,698
Nail polish.

226
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,702
What color?

227
00:12:00,578 --> 00:12:06,106
Coronation Pink.

228
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:09,920
- What else?
- A little blush.

229
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:13,233
- What color?
- Coronation Pink.

230
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:15,661
She bought the polish,
she bought the blush,

231
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:18,259
and she bought
the lipstick.

232
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:20,885
- I'll take two of everything.
- It's too overpowering.

233
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:22,042
What the hell
you talking about?

234
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,693
That ain't overpowering.

235
00:12:24,584 --> 00:12:26,051
Let's go.

236
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:27,557
- So soon?
- Yeah.

237
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,698
Woman: What's going on?
Where are you going?

238
00:12:29,609 --> 00:12:31,210
Where are you going?

239
00:12:31,146 --> 00:12:33,314
What about the blush
and the polish?

240
00:12:33,226 --> 00:12:36,428
Angela:
Charge it to the tramp.

241
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:37,833
Waiter:
Hello, can I help you?

242
00:12:37,772 --> 00:12:41,074
Five double burgers,
with cheese and bacon, rare--

243
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:42,674
Waiter: Excuse me, ma'am,
could you repeat that louder?

244
00:12:42,604 --> 00:12:44,906
Five double burgers, rare,
with cheese and bacon--

245
00:12:44,814 --> 00:12:47,715
- Louder.
- Five double burgers...

246
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:50,567
rare, with cheese and bacon!
Six clam strips,

247
00:12:50,447 --> 00:12:54,283
lots of tartar sauce!
Three large fries, well done,

248
00:12:54,128 --> 00:12:56,997
extra ketchup and two orders
of mozzarella sticks!

249
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:59,215
- What do you want?
- I'm not hungry.

250
00:12:59,121 --> 00:13:01,189
You should eat before
you go to hockey practice.

251
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:03,407
I don't want to go
to hockey practice.

252
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:04,448
You have to go.

253
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:06,204
Your father's department
is the team sponsor.

254
00:13:06,131 --> 00:13:07,464
But I'm not any good.

255
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,845
That's because
you never eat.

256
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:10,588
I'm not hungry.

257
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:13,251
Waiter: Excuse me, ma'am,
are you finished?

258
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:16,277
Also, four extra crispy
apple pies,

259
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,017
a la mode, warmed,

260
00:13:17,942 --> 00:13:20,410
and a large diet coke.

261
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:24,404
That'll do.

262
00:13:28,665 --> 00:13:31,300
Waiter: That'll be $37.50.
Please drive around.

263
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:34,530
Thank you
for your order.

264
00:13:34,395 --> 00:13:36,095
Boy:
Pass the puck around!

265
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:37,728
Coach:
Where's our goalie?

266
00:13:37,659 --> 00:13:39,159
Where's Battaglia?

267
00:13:39,099 --> 00:13:43,403
- You missed it!
- I'm open!

268
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:45,130
When you mention me
to your father,

269
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,188
I want you to study
the expression on his face

270
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:49,637
and memorize every detail
and report it back to me.

271
00:13:49,534 --> 00:13:51,602
But he doesn't
make an expression.

272
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,221
Look closer, it's subtle.

273
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,506
Wish me luck, even though
I'm gonna win tonight.

274
00:13:57,408 --> 00:13:58,568
Good luck.

275
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,404
You, too.
Bye, baby.

276
00:14:02,338 --> 00:14:03,896
Bye.

277
00:14:17,574 --> 00:14:19,008
- Coach: Capricci?
- Here.

278
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,651
- Mazzaratti?
- Yo!

279
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,716
- Ferguson?
- Here.

280
00:14:21,671 --> 00:14:22,871
- Mallory?
- Here.

281
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:24,090
- Buchanski?
- Here.

282
00:14:24,039 --> 00:14:25,073
- Landy?
- Here!

283
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:26,432
- Honeywell?
- Here!

284
00:14:26,376 --> 00:14:29,111
- Battaglia? Battaglia!
- Mazzaratti: Hurry up!

285
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,368
- Here.
- Come on, Bruno.

286
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:53,931
Bruno: Oof!

287
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:59,662
Mazzaratti:
You're such a dork!

288
00:14:59,505 --> 00:15:00,631
Oops!

289
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:07,533
G-9-6... no, G-6-9.

290
00:15:07,347 --> 00:15:09,348
Woman:
She's half in the bag.

291
00:15:09,267 --> 00:15:14,572
Oh-- goddamn it!

292
00:15:14,357 --> 00:15:15,824
I-19.

293
00:15:17,622 --> 00:15:20,352
O-65.

294
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:25,701
O-99.

295
00:15:25,687 --> 00:15:28,019
No, O-66.

296
00:15:44,637 --> 00:15:47,470
B-15!

297
00:15:50,751 --> 00:15:53,743
B-6.

298
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:01,409
Hey, Donna Marie.

299
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:03,373
Ugh...

300
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:08,176
Oh, Christ.

301
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:12,570
Keep an eye on her.
I don't want any trouble.

302
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:16,058
Donna, in case she doesn't
hear when I yell "Bingo,"

303
00:16:15,909 --> 00:16:17,776
I brought my lucky bell.

304
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:21,966
Let's hear it.

305
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:29,021
Is that bell legal?

306
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:32,474
Caller: N-32.

307
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:35,332
That bitch is wearing
Coronation Pink!

308
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:37,511
I can't belie v e your son
was married to that.

309
00:16:37,419 --> 00:16:39,720
Yeah, well, I got him now.

310
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:40,928
A lot of people
have had him.

311
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:42,810
I don't think
that bell is legal.

312
00:16:42,732 --> 00:16:45,767
There are no cowbells
allowed in the bingo hall.

313
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,313
What about her?
She's got a bell.

314
00:16:47,246 --> 00:16:49,514
The only one I see
is the one you're holding.

315
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:51,356
I'm surprised she ain't
wearing it around her neck.

316
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,281
Another crack like that,
I'll use it to wring your neck.

317
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:55,659
All right, that's enough!
Come on, give me the bell.

318
00:16:55,599 --> 00:16:56,531
No.

319
00:16:56,559 --> 00:16:58,494
- Angela!
- No!

320
00:16:58,417 --> 00:17:01,352
She's just jealous because
Dino left her for me.

321
00:17:01,233 --> 00:17:03,534
Dino did not leave me
for that tramp.

322
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:06,810
- Oh, yes, he did!
- He was always messing around.

323
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:09,009
Who would want to be married
to a fat cow like you

324
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:11,817
when he could marry
a body like this?

325
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,834
- Whore.
- Stop it.

326
00:17:13,748 --> 00:17:15,716
- Donna: Elephant.
- That's enough!

327
00:17:15,637 --> 00:17:17,071
- Bitch.
- I mean it!

328
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:18,648
- Tank.
- Step aside.

329
00:17:18,582 --> 00:17:19,749
Mother of God.

330
00:17:19,702 --> 00:17:20,430
U h-oh.

331
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,771
Mother Superior:
Angela--

332
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:23,252
Oh, my God,
she's gonna kill me!

333
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:25,158
Woman: Bingo!

334
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:29,003
Coach:
Block it!

335
00:17:37,498 --> 00:17:41,301
- You think he's dead?
- I don't know, kick him.

336
00:17:41,147 --> 00:17:46,072
Boy: Did the puck hit him
in the head, or something?

337
00:17:49,406 --> 00:17:51,006
Superior: I think
you'd better leave now.

338
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,643
But she fainted
before I got to her!

339
00:17:52,575 --> 00:17:56,878
Just take your cowbell
and go!

340
00:17:56,703 --> 00:18:01,628
Mrs. Battaglia: Donna!
Wake up!

341
00:18:05,058 --> 00:18:10,119
Angela:
Sit down, show's over.

342
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:16,844
Donna, wake up.
Oh--!

343
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:21,169
I'm gonna kill her.

344
00:18:21,542 --> 00:18:24,310
Bruno:
Bye, you guys. Oof!

345
00:18:24,199 --> 00:18:29,260
Boy: See you later,
brainiac.

346
00:18:47,886 --> 00:18:53,050
I'm sorry I fell again.

347
00:19:02,065 --> 00:19:04,533
Hi, baby.
How was hockey practice?

348
00:19:04,433 --> 00:19:05,991
Fine.

349
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:07,403
Are you going
to help me tonight?

350
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,712
Nope.

351
00:19:44,348 --> 00:19:45,781
Hello.

352
00:19:50,462 --> 00:19:53,964
Did Bruno
block any goals?

353
00:19:53,823 --> 00:19:57,459
No, he didn't
block any goals.

354
00:19:57,312 --> 00:20:00,981
What'd he do?

355
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,934
I'd rather talk about
what you did today.

356
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,477
What do you mean?

357
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:09,046
You know damn well
what I mean.

358
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:12,435
She started it.

359
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:15,627
I'm not talking about
your little...

360
00:20:15,492 --> 00:20:20,451
fight with Donna Marie.

361
00:20:20,389 --> 00:20:22,324
"At approximately 2:30
this afternoon

362
00:20:22,247 --> 00:20:24,781
a 1970 yellow
Cadillac convertible

363
00:20:24,678 --> 00:20:28,982
tried to mow down
a bunch of kids...

364
00:20:28,808 --> 00:20:31,042
in front of St. Anthony's
Catholic Grammar School."

365
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:35,156
That wasn't me.

366
00:20:34,986 --> 00:20:37,253
"Pink interior,

367
00:20:37,162 --> 00:20:39,764
peacock feather
down the side,

368
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:43,128
license plate, 'D-I-V-A.'"

369
00:20:42,988 --> 00:20:47,392
- It was an accident.
- Cut the crap, Angela.

370
00:20:47,213 --> 00:20:49,214
What is in your brain?
What are you thinking?

371
00:20:49,134 --> 00:20:51,902
Why do you constantly
humiliate and embarrass me?

372
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,958
Angela: You're always thinking
of yourself.

373
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:55,338
What about us for a change?

374
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,814
I don't want Bruno anywhere near
that hockey arena anymore.

375
00:20:57,712 --> 00:21:00,447
And if you--
if you go within

376
00:21:00,336 --> 00:21:02,370
a two-mile radius
of that school,

377
00:21:02,289 --> 00:21:06,693
I will personally
arrest you.

378
00:21:06,514 --> 00:21:11,314
But we didn't hit anybody.

379
00:21:14,868 --> 00:21:19,339
What is that?

380
00:21:19,158 --> 00:21:22,126
- What?
- What he's got on.

381
00:21:22,006 --> 00:21:24,441
It's a night shirt.

382
00:21:24,343 --> 00:21:26,678
No, it's not.
It's a dress.

383
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:30,019
Angela: It's a nightgown.

384
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,448
What's he doing
in a nightgown?

385
00:21:31,385 --> 00:21:34,320
Going to sleep.

386
00:21:34,201 --> 00:21:36,035
Dino: I thought we said
no more of that stuff.

387
00:21:35,962 --> 00:21:38,030
Angela: You said no more
of that stuff.

388
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:41,482
What kind of little boy
goes to bed in a nightgown?

389
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,541
One who plays hockey.

390
00:21:43,452 --> 00:21:48,616
He doesn't play hockey.

391
00:21:49,022 --> 00:21:54,126
Dino: And he's not gonna
play anymore.

392
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,985
- Why not?
- Because he stinks!

393
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:58,211
- He'll get better!
- No, he won't.

394
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,981
- How can you say that?
- He'll never get better!

395
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:04,167
Angela: If you were more
of a father and a husband--

396
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:06,535
Dino: I'm not your husband
any more, goddamn it!

397
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:08,068
I wish I never was!

398
00:22:08,002 --> 00:22:11,071
- You didn't mean that.
- Yes, I do.

399
00:22:10,947 --> 00:22:12,347
Look at you, Angela,

400
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,059
Look at what you've
let yourself become,

401
00:22:13,988 --> 00:22:15,855
you're 450 pounds,

402
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,115
and your little boy
is sleeping in a dress.

403
00:22:18,021 --> 00:22:22,091
How do you expect me
to feel?

404
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:24,561
I am through
being embarrassed

405
00:22:24,455 --> 00:22:29,380
and humiliated
by the both of you.

406
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:50,836
Bruno: I was taught we were all
born with original sin,

407
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:53,772
and may never achieve
forgiveness.

408
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:59,208
I wondered what
my sin was.

409
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:15,444
What book are we
gonna read tonight?

410
00:23:15,316 --> 00:23:18,318
I don't wanna read.

411
00:23:18,197 --> 00:23:20,632
How about a couple
of pages from the dictionary?

412
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:22,868
No, thank you.

413
00:23:22,774 --> 00:23:24,374
It's Random House,
unabridged.

414
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:26,141
No.

415
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,275
Don't you want to prepare
for the spelling bee?

416
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:35,095
I'm prepared.

417
00:23:34,937 --> 00:23:40,237
Maybe we should get you
some pajamas.

418
00:23:41,755 --> 00:23:43,450
Fine.

419
00:23:47,452 --> 00:23:49,353
I think I'm gonna start
my diet tomorrow.

420
00:23:49,277 --> 00:23:53,948
- Do you think I should?
- Yes.

421
00:23:53,759 --> 00:23:55,559
He used to read to us--

422
00:23:55,486 --> 00:23:57,113
poetry.

423
00:23:57,119 --> 00:23:59,020
And he used to sing opera.

424
00:23:58,944 --> 00:24:00,845
He sang us to sleep,
do you remember?

425
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,065
No.

426
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,658
Good night, baby.

427
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:14,725
Good night.

428
00:24:15,236 --> 00:24:20,036
Sweet dreams, baby.

429
00:27:15,379 --> 00:27:22,113
Bruno: Sometimes what you wear
can bring God closer to you.

430
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:30,257
But sometimes
what you want to wear

431
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:35,700
can separate you
from people.

432
00:27:40,442 --> 00:27:45,146
Girl: Move it.
Watch out.

433
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:48,457
Boy: Don't push.

434
00:27:48,316 --> 00:27:50,284
Girl: Hey, remember me?

435
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:52,940
My name is Shawniqua Van Adams.
What's your name?

436
00:27:52,829 --> 00:27:53,989
Bruno.

437
00:27:54,014 --> 00:27:55,881
I'm new here, Bruno.
Do you want to be my friend?

438
00:27:55,806 --> 00:27:58,441
Hey, I said, do you want
to be my friend?

439
00:27:58,335 --> 00:28:02,668
What are you looking at?

440
00:28:03,232 --> 00:28:05,133
What are the nuns
like here, anyway?

441
00:28:05,056 --> 00:28:07,658
Are any of them black?

442
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,121
- Get him!
- Hurry up!

443
00:28:10,018 --> 00:28:12,153
Shawniqua:
What are you doing?

444
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,127
Stop it!

445
00:28:15,075 --> 00:28:16,702
Hey!

446
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:18,566
Stop!

447
00:28:25,094 --> 00:28:27,629
Shawniqua: Stop it!
Let him go!

448
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:31,163
Boy: Open the window.

449
00:28:31,016 --> 00:28:33,450
Boy: What are you
going to do now, Battaglia,

450
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:36,555
without your fat ass mother
here to protect you?

451
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:39,093
We're really
gonna drop you now.

452
00:28:38,986 --> 00:28:41,220
Boy:
Do it!

453
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:43,899
Shawniqua:
What are you doing?

454
00:28:43,787 --> 00:28:45,354
Let's drop
the little geek.

455
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:47,392
- Here she comes!
- Guys, guys!

456
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,676
Hey!
What is going on?

457
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:53,640
Boy: Holy crap,
it's Sister Drink A Lot!

458
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:55,182
Unh--!

459
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,744
He was hanging out
the window.

460
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,105
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were!

461
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:03,075
That kid was hanging him.

462
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,160
- No, he wasn't.
- Yes, he was!

463
00:29:05,073 --> 00:29:06,940
I'm gonna put you
on punishment.

464
00:29:06,865 --> 00:29:09,033
That's plenty.
That's enough from everyone.

465
00:29:08,945 --> 00:29:13,403
Bruno, take your seat.

466
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:29,626
Nun: Okay, Mazzaratti,
you know the drill.

467
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:32,968
And you, young lady...

468
00:29:32,887 --> 00:29:34,955
I know you're new here
at St. Anthony's

469
00:29:34,872 --> 00:29:36,773
and it might have been
permitted at your old school,

470
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:39,399
but here, we do not play
"Cowboys and Indians"

471
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,191
in the classroom.
Give me the guns.

472
00:29:41,114 --> 00:29:42,547
No!

473
00:29:44,987 --> 00:29:46,521
What did you say to me?

474
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,394
I said, no.

475
00:29:48,316 --> 00:29:50,918
Nun: If you do not
give me those guns,

476
00:29:50,813 --> 00:29:52,113
you will have to sit
in the corner

477
00:29:52,061 --> 00:29:54,629
for the rest of the day,
facing the wall.

478
00:29:54,525 --> 00:29:56,793
And you will not be able
to participate

479
00:29:56,702 --> 00:29:58,570
in the spelling bee.

480
00:29:58,495 --> 00:30:04,266
Good.
I hate spellin'.

481
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,267
Nun: First of all,
it's not "spellin'."

482
00:30:06,177 --> 00:30:07,844
It has a "g"
on the end of it.

483
00:30:07,777 --> 00:30:09,311
It's not "spellin',"
it's spelling.

484
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,817
"I hate spelling."

485
00:30:10,754 --> 00:30:13,823
Well, I ain't spell-ing
'caus e I ain't giving you my guns.

486
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:20,091
A-I-N-T, ain't.

487
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,801
Give me the guns.

488
00:30:22,725 --> 00:30:25,827
I said, no.

489
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:28,537
If you do not
give me those guns,

490
00:30:28,423 --> 00:30:31,958
you are going to be
very, very sorry.

491
00:30:31,815 --> 00:30:33,146
Phew!

492
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,284
Not as sorry as you look.

493
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:40,437
O-kay.

494
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,084
Consolata!

495
00:31:05,648 --> 00:31:07,716
Bruno: In the beginning,
there was the Word

496
00:31:07,633 --> 00:31:09,534
and the Word was God.

497
00:31:09,458 --> 00:31:11,392
I used to believe that
if I knew all the words,

498
00:31:11,314 --> 00:31:14,149
I could talk to God,
and God could talk to me.

499
00:31:14,035 --> 00:31:15,736
But the more words I learned,

500
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,968
the further away from God
I seemed to get.

501
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:21,779
Predacious.
P-R-E-

502
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:23,350
D-A-S-

503
00:31:23,349 --> 00:31:25,483
I-O-U-S.
Predacious.

504
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:28,566
That is incorrect.

505
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:30,906
Bruno, it's your turn.

506
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:36,733
The word, once again,
"predacious."

507
00:31:38,361 --> 00:31:40,462
Predacious.

508
00:31:40,378 --> 00:31:42,608
P-R-E-D-A-

509
00:31:42,586 --> 00:31:44,417
C-I-O-U-S.

510
00:31:44,411 --> 00:31:49,541
- Predacious.
- That is correct.

511
00:31:49,628 --> 00:31:52,430
Patricia, it's your turn.

512
00:31:52,317 --> 00:31:53,984
Your word is "apocalypse,"

513
00:31:53,917 --> 00:31:55,317
as in Francis
Ford Coppola's

514
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:59,298
"Apocalypse Now."
Apocalypse.

515
00:31:59,135 --> 00:32:00,835
Shawniqua: Ha ha ha ha!

516
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:04,998
You ain't never
gonna catch me!

517
00:32:06,753 --> 00:32:08,387
Apocalypse.

518
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:10,687
A-P-P-

519
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:12,091
O-C-

520
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:16,201
Shawniqua:
Hey! Hey, stop!

521
00:32:16,035 --> 00:32:17,336
Knock it off.

522
00:32:17,284 --> 00:32:21,515
I told you so.
Keep your hands up.

523
00:32:21,381 --> 00:32:24,983
L-Y-P-S-E.
Apocalypse.

524
00:32:24,837 --> 00:32:29,261
That is incorrect.

525
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,315
Shawniqua: Don't mess with me.
I mean it.

526
00:32:31,239 --> 00:32:33,104
Move it!

527
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:53,270
Bruno: Sometimes on Earth
you can find something

528
00:32:53,165 --> 00:32:55,733
that resembles
a little piece of Heaven.

529
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,497
And sometimes, on Earth,

530
00:32:57,422 --> 00:33:00,658
a little piece of Heaven
can find you.

531
00:33:00,527 --> 00:33:02,795
Hi, Bruno,
remember me?

532
00:33:02,703 --> 00:33:04,330
Yeah.

533
00:33:04,336 --> 00:33:06,403
Did you eat
your lunch up there?

534
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,446
Yeah.

535
00:33:07,473 --> 00:33:10,675
- Guess where I ate mine?
- Mother Superior's office.

536
00:33:10,546 --> 00:33:13,915
Hey, that's right.
She took my hat...

537
00:33:13,778 --> 00:33:16,780
but I hid my guns
under my skirt.

538
00:33:16,659 --> 00:33:19,194
Do you like guns?

539
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:20,719
No.

540
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:25,142
How'd the spelling bee go?

541
00:33:25,013 --> 00:33:26,614
Fine. I won.

542
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,885
I knew it.
I knew you were smart

543
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:32,459
the minute
I laid eyes on you.

544
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,612
Hey,
where are you going?

545
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:37,822
Bruno, do you want to walk
a dog with me after school?

546
00:33:37,689 --> 00:33:39,987
No.

547
00:33:39,961 --> 00:33:44,297
Don't you want to be
my friend?

548
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:46,757
- No, I don't.
- Why?

549
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:47,885
Because you're too flamboyant.

550
00:33:47,835 --> 00:33:50,537
I don't want another
flamboyant woman in my life.

551
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:54,230
- I'm just expressing myself.
- Do it someplace else.

552
00:33:54,077 --> 00:33:57,246
What are you doing,
you little faggot?

553
00:33:57,118 --> 00:34:00,020
Goddamn it, I'm gonna
have to kill you.

554
00:33:59,902 --> 00:34:02,604
Leave him alone!

555
00:34:02,495 --> 00:34:06,464
Back off, nigger.

556
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:10,141
- Don't call her a nigger.
- What'd you say to me, faggot?

557
00:34:09,985 --> 00:34:13,320
- Don't call her a nigger!
- You're dead, Ba-fag-lia.

558
00:34:13,186 --> 00:34:14,153
There's a fight over here.

559
00:34:14,114 --> 00:34:18,242
- Faggot.
- Drop him, Eddie!

560
00:34:18,884 --> 00:34:23,115
Boy: Hit him
where it hurts, Eddie.

561
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:28,593
Cut it out!
Get off.

562
00:34:28,518 --> 00:34:30,611
I mean it!

563
00:34:32,007 --> 00:34:35,142
- Nun: Fall in!
- It's the Sarge!

564
00:34:35,015 --> 00:34:37,183
Boy: Go home,
you stupid weirdo.

565
00:34:37,096 --> 00:34:41,700
Mr. Battaglia.

566
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:45,617
Here we are once again.
And Miss Van Adams.

567
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:51,650
Why doesn't this surprise me?

568
00:34:52,396 --> 00:34:54,231
Didn't they teach you
where you came from

569
00:34:54,157 --> 00:34:56,925
never to pick on kids
weaker than yourself?

570
00:34:56,813 --> 00:34:58,814
I wasn't picking on him!

571
00:34:58,734 --> 00:35:00,292
Oh, no?

572
00:35:00,302 --> 00:35:01,536
Then what were you doing
on top of him?

573
00:35:01,487 --> 00:35:03,321
I was protecting him!

574
00:35:03,247 --> 00:35:05,381
Superior: You expect me
to believe that?

575
00:35:05,296 --> 00:35:07,230
Why not?

576
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,191
What do you have to say
about this, young man?

577
00:35:14,098 --> 00:35:15,827
Okay.

578
00:35:15,827 --> 00:35:18,462
Okay, what?

579
00:35:18,355 --> 00:35:22,882
Okay, I'll be your friend.

580
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:34,825
Oh, God.

581
00:35:36,632 --> 00:35:40,135
Bruno:
Daddy pine cone!

582
00:35:39,993 --> 00:35:42,127
Another dad pine cone.

583
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:45,043
- Do you like Diana Ross?
- I like Maria Callas.

584
00:35:44,922 --> 00:35:46,890
Yeah, she's nice,
but when I move

585
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,812
to be a cowboy,
I'm taking Diana with me.

586
00:35:48,731 --> 00:35:53,434
- You can come, too.
- Okay. I'll bring Maria.

587
00:35:53,244 --> 00:35:55,245
Shawniqua:
Hey, do you sing?

588
00:35:55,164 --> 00:35:56,965
Bruno:
No, but my dad used to.

589
00:35:56,893 --> 00:35:59,020
He did?

590
00:35:59,005 --> 00:36:04,110
- But he doesn't sing anymore.
- That's too bad.

591
00:36:03,904 --> 00:36:06,138
Bruno: Do you think the tops
of the trees touch Heaven?

592
00:36:06,048 --> 00:36:08,450
Shawniqua: I don't know,
I've never been up that high.

593
00:36:08,353 --> 00:36:10,654
Hey, do you smoke?

594
00:36:10,561 --> 00:36:12,662
No, do you?

595
00:36:12,578 --> 00:36:14,979
No, it's bad for you.

596
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,384
My mom says
it turns your soul black.

597
00:36:17,283 --> 00:36:19,417
What's wrong
with a black soul?

598
00:36:19,331 --> 00:36:21,265
Nothing.

599
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:28,992
Oh, I'm cold.

600
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:32,679
Wanna wear my pants?

601
00:36:32,551 --> 00:36:35,353
What?
You mean switch?

602
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:38,742
Sure, I'll trade you
my pants for your skirt.

603
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:45,402
- Do you want to?
- Okay. Come on.

604
00:36:50,315 --> 00:36:52,316
This is where we're gonna
make the switch.

605
00:36:52,236 --> 00:36:55,238
Do we have to go in here?
Grave yards scare me.

606
00:36:55,117 --> 00:36:57,652
Well, they don't scare me.
Come on, Bruno,

607
00:36:57,549 --> 00:37:01,819
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

608
00:37:01,646 --> 00:37:04,848
Stick close to me.
I've got you covered.

609
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,655
Cowboys are very good
at protecting people,

610
00:37:07,537 --> 00:37:09,738
and I'm the best
cowboy there is.

611
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:11,516
So don't you worry,
Bruno.

612
00:37:11,441 --> 00:37:16,679
Anything jumps out at you,
I'll get 'em.

613
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:19,369
And besides,
dead people can't hurt you.

614
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:21,652
After they die
they be come angels,

615
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:22,990
and angels are nice.

616
00:37:22,932 --> 00:37:25,367
- Not all of them.
- How do you know?

617
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:27,336
Have you ever seen one?

618
00:37:27,253 --> 00:37:28,379
Yeah.

619
00:37:28,406 --> 00:37:29,930
You have?

620
00:37:29,942 --> 00:37:31,509
Yeah, lots of them.

621
00:37:31,446 --> 00:37:33,281
Are any of the angels black?

622
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,231
What?

623
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:39,400
Are any of the angels black?

624
00:37:39,192 --> 00:37:40,591
I knew it.

625
00:37:42,073 --> 00:37:44,808
Hey, look.
That's where we're gonna change.

626
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:45,999
No, not in there.

627
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,744
Come on.

628
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:49,807
Shawniqua: I hate dresses,

629
00:37:49,723 --> 00:37:52,124
except for my Communion dress,
and that's holy.

630
00:37:52,028 --> 00:37:54,196
- A holy dress?
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:57,277
I have dreams about holy dresses.
Angels wear them.

632
00:37:57,149 --> 00:37:58,549
Shawniqua:
Those are holy vestments.

633
00:37:58,493 --> 00:38:01,295
They are?
I have a holy doll.

634
00:38:01,182 --> 00:38:03,150
It's an angel.
My mother made it for me.

635
00:38:03,071 --> 00:38:04,538
Shawniqua:
I don't like dolls,

636
00:38:04,479 --> 00:38:06,813
but I wouldn't mind
if it was an angel.

637
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,088
Oh, it's freezing in here.
Come on.

638
00:38:08,993 --> 00:38:12,495
Now, let's go.

639
00:38:12,353 --> 00:38:16,256
Hurry up, we got
a dog to walk.

640
00:38:16,098 --> 00:38:17,326
Why?

641
00:38:17,346 --> 00:38:20,148
- Gotta make some money.
- I get an allowance

642
00:38:20,035 --> 00:38:21,936
for helping my mom
make dresses.

643
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,461
That's how I get
my money.

644
00:38:23,397 --> 00:38:24,762
You do?

645
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:29,209
Shawniqua:
Mrs. Draco, are you alive?

646
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,054
Hello?

647
00:38:38,088 --> 00:38:40,589
Heel, Baby, heel!

648
00:38:40,488 --> 00:38:43,724
About face, Baby!
About face!

649
00:38:43,594 --> 00:38:45,728
Bad dog, naughty Baby.

650
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:49,545
No, no, no, no!

651
00:38:49,387 --> 00:38:51,455
What is going on here?

652
00:38:51,372 --> 00:38:53,039
Did you scare my Baby?

653
00:38:52,972 --> 00:38:55,574
No, Baby tried
to scare my friend.

654
00:38:55,469 --> 00:38:58,404
Don't be afraid.
Baby is an angel,

655
00:38:58,285 --> 00:39:00,053
aren't you, sweetie?

656
00:38:59,982 --> 00:39:01,949
Okay, make sure
you take him

657
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:04,605
past his favorite
fire hydrant.

658
00:39:04,495 --> 00:39:06,630
Off you go.

659
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:07,644
Shawniqua: Come on, Baby.

660
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,367
Bye, girls.

661
00:39:09,296 --> 00:39:11,127
Bye.

662
00:39:11,121 --> 00:39:12,455
Shawniqua: Heel, Baby!

663
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,235
You can't show fear.
They smell it,

664
00:39:14,161 --> 00:39:17,130
and then they get scared.
That's why he growled.

665
00:39:17,011 --> 00:39:18,811
- He didn't seem very scared.
- Well, he was.

666
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,773
- Here, take the leash.
- No.

667
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,692
If you don't take it,
I'm letting go.

668
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:27,571
See, if you don't show fear,
you can do anything.

669
00:39:27,509 --> 00:39:32,741
Shawniqua: Now tell him
to lift his leg.

670
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:39,266
Come on in.
Now, don't you be scared.

671
00:39:39,544 --> 00:39:41,411
Wow!
Is that your mother?

672
00:39:41,336 --> 00:39:45,473
- Yeah.
- How old is she?

673
00:39:45,306 --> 00:39:46,603
34.

674
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:50,788
How's she get so big?

675
00:39:50,619 --> 00:39:55,389
- Surplussage.
- What's that?

676
00:39:55,196 --> 00:39:57,230
She eats a lot.

677
00:39:57,148 --> 00:40:00,851
- What does she eat?
- She's on a diet now.

678
00:40:00,702 --> 00:40:02,567
She is?

679
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:09,763
She's gonna be skinny
real soon.

680
00:40:26,533 --> 00:40:30,036
- What's your mom like?
- My mom's dead.

681
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:31,418
She is?

682
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,865
She died of breast cancer.

683
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:36,469
Her name was Brudell,
she was beautiful.

684
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,028
Who takes care of you?
Your dad?

685
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:41,688
No, my dad
lives in China.

686
00:40:41,576 --> 00:40:43,477
Who takes care of you?

687
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:45,703
My brother Henry.

688
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,544
He runs a make up
and hair salon.

689
00:40:47,466 --> 00:40:49,300
He likes Maria Callas, too.

690
00:40:49,227 --> 00:40:51,328
- He does?
- U m-hmm.

691
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:52,510
Close your eyes.

692
00:40:52,459 --> 00:40:55,328
And he owns
a Pontiac Firebird.

693
00:40:55,213 --> 00:40:57,948
It's magenta.

694
00:40:57,837 --> 00:40:59,304
Lipstick.

695
00:41:01,582 --> 00:41:05,184
Go like this.

696
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:09,236
Hmmm, fierce.

697
00:41:10,577 --> 00:41:14,246
Do you think it's okay
that I wear dresses?

698
00:41:14,097 --> 00:41:16,799
Why not?
I wear pants.

699
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:19,158
But that's different.

700
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,926
No, it's not.

701
00:41:20,851 --> 00:41:23,119
We're both just
free spirits

702
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:24,594
trying to express
ourselves.

703
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:26,193
Well,

704
00:41:26,197 --> 00:41:29,365
this is very
flamboyant.

705
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:35,664
Shawniqua: I'm a bad angel
disguised as a cowboy!

706
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:44,569
Stay down, Baby!
Stay, Baby!

707
00:41:44,473 --> 00:41:49,238
Be a good dog!
Be good!

708
00:41:52,507 --> 00:41:54,873
No!

709
00:41:54,844 --> 00:41:56,436
No!

710
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:03,588
Medic: Little girl
hit by a car!

711
00:42:03,518 --> 00:42:05,419
She just ran
into the street.

712
00:42:05,343 --> 00:42:08,378
Grandmother's on the way.

713
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:10,156
Woman: I barely had enough time
to hit the brakes!

714
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,147
Doctor: What do you got?

715
00:42:11,104 --> 00:42:13,439
Heart rate's 110,
BP 80 over 50, 12 rest.

716
00:42:13,345 --> 00:42:14,945
- Level of consciousness?
- Unconscious.

717
00:42:14,881 --> 00:42:16,182
Okay, let's prepare to move.
On my count--

718
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,998
Ready?
One, two, three, go.

719
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:21,350
- Thank you very much.
- Very good.

720
00:42:21,251 --> 00:42:23,152
- Blood pressure?
- It's dropping.

721
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:24,976
Pupils are fixed
and dilated.

722
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,402
We got a concussion.

723
00:42:27,301 --> 00:42:28,668
She wearing a wig?
Take this off.

724
00:42:28,613 --> 00:42:32,983
Get the dress off, too.

725
00:42:32,806 --> 00:42:34,940
Oh, it's a little boy.

726
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:37,123
Prepare for a C T scan.
Call Radiology.

727
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:38,398
I want a full cervical
and spinal series.

728
00:42:38,344 --> 00:42:39,411
Nurse: Right.

729
00:42:39,368 --> 00:42:44,205
Make it portable.
Check the oxygen, please.

730
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:47,044
Why can't you be more normal?

731
00:42:46,922 --> 00:42:49,657
No sissies in Heaven.

732
00:42:49,546 --> 00:42:52,582
- What's going on here?
- Pussy!

733
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,794
...very, very sorry.

734
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:57,001
Hey, Bruno, you pussy.

735
00:42:56,909 --> 00:43:02,937
As long as you don't show fear,
you can do anything!

736
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:44,203
Doctor:
Mrs. Battaglia?

737
00:43:44,313 --> 00:43:45,446
I'm Dr. Pike.

738
00:43:45,401 --> 00:43:47,836
Oh, my God,
I think I'm gonna faint.

739
00:43:47,738 --> 00:43:49,205
- Watch out.
- Ouch!

740
00:43:49,146 --> 00:43:51,948
- Oh, sorry.
- How is he?

741
00:43:51,835 --> 00:43:53,269
He's gonna be okay.

742
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:57,238
Oh, thank God.

743
00:43:59,389 --> 00:44:00,856
Hey.

744
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:02,095
What the hell is that?

745
00:44:02,046 --> 00:44:04,147
A wig.
Thank God he was wearing it.

746
00:44:04,062 --> 00:44:05,863
He was wearing a wig?

747
00:44:05,791 --> 00:44:07,658
We had to discard
the dress.

748
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:12,154
Oh, my God.

749
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:15,338
Believe it or not, the wig helped
minimize the boy's injury.

750
00:44:15,202 --> 00:44:20,332
He just has a mild concussion,
it's nothing serious.

751
00:44:20,226 --> 00:44:22,127
Where is he?
Can I see him?

752
00:44:22,051 --> 00:44:23,184
No, he's resting
right now.

753
00:44:23,139 --> 00:44:24,707
We want to keep him
overnight for observation,

754
00:44:24,644 --> 00:44:26,445
but he'll be able
to go home in the morning.

755
00:44:26,373 --> 00:44:28,240
If you want to see him
you'll be able to

756
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,899
if you don't mind
hanging around for a while.

757
00:44:29,829 --> 00:44:31,964
Okay, thank you.

758
00:44:31,878 --> 00:44:34,179
Let's get the hell
out of here.

759
00:44:34,086 --> 00:44:36,821
Dino, where in the hell
are you going?

760
00:44:36,711 --> 00:44:42,239
- Home.
- Listen to me-- Dino!

761
00:45:46,105 --> 00:45:48,073
Mrs. Battaglia?

762
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:49,427
Is he all right?

763
00:45:49,370 --> 00:45:52,039
You can see
your son now.

764
00:45:51,931 --> 00:45:53,865
- Thank you so much.
- Fourth door on the right.

765
00:45:53,787 --> 00:45:55,277
Thank you.

766
00:46:14,977 --> 00:46:16,544
Shawniqua:
I'm glad you're okay.

767
00:46:16,481 --> 00:46:19,316
My daddy tanned my hide
real good

768
00:46:19,202 --> 00:46:23,899
because you got hit
by that car.

769
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:29,435
I thought you said
your dad was in China?

770
00:46:32,421 --> 00:46:35,924
Give me another word.

771
00:46:35,782 --> 00:46:38,350
Abom-in-able?

772
00:46:38,247 --> 00:46:40,382
Abominable.

773
00:46:40,296 --> 00:46:46,201
A-B-O-M-I-N-A-B-L-E.
Abominable.

774
00:46:45,961 --> 00:46:50,260
That is correct.

775
00:46:54,315 --> 00:46:58,285
Did it hurt?

776
00:46:58,124 --> 00:47:00,251
Yes.

777
00:47:00,237 --> 00:47:04,604
It always does.

778
00:47:19,634 --> 00:47:21,202
Hey, Delores.

779
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,436
Hey, kids.

780
00:47:22,931 --> 00:47:24,465
Hey, Delores.

781
00:47:24,403 --> 00:47:27,872
Well, if it ain't the little
resurrected accident victim.

782
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:29,833
How was your brush
with death?

783
00:47:29,748 --> 00:47:31,113
Fine.

784
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,625
Why, did you see God?

785
00:47:32,565 --> 00:47:34,099
No, but I saw angels.

786
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,005
Did you see
my Auntie Francie?

787
00:47:35,926 --> 00:47:37,393
No.

788
00:47:37,399 --> 00:47:39,667
Should he be walking around?

789
00:47:39,575 --> 00:47:41,943
He's fine. He's going back
to school tomorrow,

790
00:47:41,848 --> 00:47:43,815
but I told him he could have
an early Easter present.

791
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:47,206
Ooh, a present!
For surviving death, huh?

792
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:50,126
Yeah.

793
00:47:50,074 --> 00:47:51,141
What are you
gonna get?

794
00:47:51,098 --> 00:47:53,266
- Pajamas.
- And a dress.

795
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:54,874
A dress?

796
00:47:54,875 --> 00:47:56,676
He can only wear it
in the house

797
00:47:56,604 --> 00:47:58,238
and only
for a little while,

798
00:47:58,172 --> 00:48:00,340
because he's getting
to be a big boy.

799
00:48:00,253 --> 00:48:03,355
I know lots of big boys
who wear dresses.

800
00:48:03,230 --> 00:48:05,398
You remember Jose?
He was wearing a dress--

801
00:48:05,310 --> 00:48:06,607
What?

802
00:48:06,623 --> 00:48:08,056
Man: Yo, Mr. Mazzaratti,
how ya doin'?

803
00:48:07,998 --> 00:48:10,767
Delores: You remember Jose?
He lived down the street from you...

804
00:48:10,656 --> 00:48:12,590
Hold on, Eddie,
hold on.

805
00:48:12,512 --> 00:48:14,646
Delores: Oh, I see.
Jose's colorful,

806
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,562
there's nothing wrong with that.
Everybody likes Jose.

807
00:48:17,441 --> 00:48:19,075
He's a great guy.
It's okay to wear dresses.

808
00:48:19,009 --> 00:48:20,543
Come on, Dad, let's go.

809
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:23,017
Delores: Hey, Bruno.

810
00:48:22,914 --> 00:48:26,050
I think this calls for
a little fragrance.

811
00:48:25,924 --> 00:48:28,358
- What do you say?
- What is it?

812
00:48:28,260 --> 00:48:30,328
Eau de Celeste.

813
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:33,113
The scent of Heaven.

814
00:48:32,998 --> 00:48:34,090
Yeah.

815
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:43,133
- You like it?
- Yeah.

816
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:47,110
Come on, Mom,
let's go find some beauty.

817
00:48:46,953 --> 00:48:49,754
- Hey, come on.
- All right.

818
00:48:49,641 --> 00:48:52,710
- Yeah, in here.
- You're the boss.

819
00:48:52,586 --> 00:48:55,822
Oh, come on, Mom.

820
00:48:55,692 --> 00:48:59,127
Okay, that should do it.
Call if you need anything.

821
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:00,148
Okay.

822
00:49:29,813 --> 00:49:31,880
This is the one.

823
00:49:31,797 --> 00:49:34,132
Is this what you saw
in Heaven?

824
00:49:34,038 --> 00:49:37,273
Kind of. Almost.
It's the closest.

825
00:49:37,142 --> 00:49:38,074
Good.

826
00:49:40,919 --> 00:49:43,587
Cash or charge, Ange?

827
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:46,949
Charge it to Dino.

828
00:49:46,809 --> 00:49:47,969
Good.

829
00:49:47,993 --> 00:49:50,327
This is going to have to be
a little higher,

830
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:52,034
maybe about that size.

831
00:49:51,962 --> 00:49:53,429
We're gonna have to
drape it over.

832
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,638
You read my mind
about the shoulder.

833
00:49:55,547 --> 00:49:58,916
- I got the perfect color.
- We have to make this shorter,

834
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:00,681
and we're going to make it
flow like this,

835
00:50:00,604 --> 00:50:02,472
and we're gonna cut it
on the bias,

836
00:50:02,397 --> 00:50:03,564
because that makes it
flow better.

837
00:50:03,518 --> 00:50:04,684
- Okay.
- That's the whole point,

838
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:06,038
but I think this is
the wrong fabric.

839
00:50:05,982 --> 00:50:07,449
Easy.

840
00:50:07,455 --> 00:50:08,521
I picked it myself.

841
00:50:08,478 --> 00:50:11,280
We're going to need
more sequins here.

842
00:50:11,167 --> 00:50:12,601
That's good,
I like that.

843
00:50:12,544 --> 00:50:13,878
We're going to have this
like this,

844
00:50:13,824 --> 00:50:15,624
and pull this out,
and pull it over there.

845
00:50:15,552 --> 00:50:17,120
It's gonna be
a lot shorter, though.

846
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:18,115
Okay.

847
00:50:18,145 --> 00:50:20,713
If we take this
and make this part of the wing--

848
00:50:20,609 --> 00:50:22,777
- Wait, hold this like this.
- That's good.

849
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:27,023
Did Delores help you
pick that out?

850
00:51:08,430 --> 00:51:10,398
Welcome...

851
00:51:10,383 --> 00:51:12,951
to St. Anthony's
58th Annual Spelling Bee.

852
00:51:12,848 --> 00:51:15,616
The winner of this bee
will go on to compete

853
00:51:15,504 --> 00:51:17,572
in the regional competition
next month.

854
00:51:17,489 --> 00:51:19,590
The winner of the regional
will go on

855
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:20,772
to the state competition.

856
00:51:20,722 --> 00:51:22,656
The winner of that bee
will go

857
00:51:22,578 --> 00:51:24,646
to the National Catholic
Spelling Championship

858
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:27,198
in Washington, D C.

859
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:31,728
the winner of the National
Catholic Spelling Championship

860
00:51:31,541 --> 00:51:34,777
will fly, all expenses paid,

861
00:51:34,646 --> 00:51:36,947
to the Vatican City,
in Rome,

862
00:51:36,854 --> 00:51:39,756
where he, or she,

863
00:51:39,639 --> 00:51:41,973
will have a private audience

864
00:51:41,879 --> 00:51:48,340
with Pope John Paul II.

865
00:51:49,946 --> 00:51:53,548
So, let's all bow our heads
in a silent prayer

866
00:51:53,402 --> 00:52:00,033
as our little candidates
step onto the stage.

867
00:52:11,423 --> 00:52:13,524
Superior: That's enough!

868
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:18,706
All right,
that's enough.

869
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:27,452
The next one to make a sound
will be expelled forever.

870
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:30,535
Expelled from school
and Heaven-- forever.

871
00:52:30,404 --> 00:52:36,343
Now, will our first contestant
please step up to the mic?

872
00:52:36,102 --> 00:52:41,106
Our first word
is "parsimonious."

873
00:52:40,903 --> 00:52:43,404
As in,
"The Catholic Church

874
00:52:43,303 --> 00:52:48,407
is never parsimonious."

875
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:51,770
Parsimonious.
P-A-R-

876
00:52:51,625 --> 00:52:54,150
S-I-M-

877
00:52:54,122 --> 00:52:55,589
O-N-

878
00:52:55,595 --> 00:52:58,497
E-U-S.
Parsimonious.

879
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:02,650
That is incorrect.

880
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:08,346
Will the second contestant
step up to the microphone?

881
00:53:20,274 --> 00:53:21,536
Get him.

882
00:53:44,504 --> 00:53:46,605
What the hell
is he doing in a dress?

883
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,655
Expressing myself.

884
00:53:48,569 --> 00:53:50,436
Besides, it's not a dress,
it's a holy vestment.

885
00:53:50,361 --> 00:53:52,659
Shut up.

886
00:53:52,634 --> 00:53:57,004
No, I will not shut up!

887
00:53:56,827 --> 00:53:59,362
I'm going to continue
to express myself!

888
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:02,094
You say angels help us.
Well, I believe that.

889
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:05,449
They give me power
with my dresses!

890
00:54:05,309 --> 00:54:07,878
Besides, Scotsmen
wear dresses,

891
00:54:07,774 --> 00:54:09,107
they're called kilts.

892
00:54:09,054 --> 00:54:11,522
King Tut wore a skirt
as most men in Egypt did,

893
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:16,293
a skirt of tufted wool.

894
00:54:16,096 --> 00:54:17,763
The Dalai Lama wears
robe dresses,

895
00:54:17,696 --> 00:54:20,632
as have all
of his predecessors.

896
00:54:20,514 --> 00:54:23,582
Greek charioteers
wore short paneled skirts.

897
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:25,693
The Siamese kings
wore dresses.

898
00:54:25,603 --> 00:54:29,039
The Chinese Emperor Yao
wore a Pau styled robe,

899
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,868
much like the kimono,
but more flared out at the bottom.

900
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:34,114
Now...

901
00:54:34,085 --> 00:54:35,319
this was also worn...

902
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:38,671
by high ranking women,
with fringes at the bottom!

903
00:54:38,534 --> 00:54:41,503
- That'd be good for you, Mom.
- Easy.

904
00:54:41,383 --> 00:54:43,484
Muslim men wear dresses.

905
00:54:43,399 --> 00:54:45,600
H ungarian cowboys
wear dresses.

906
00:54:45,512 --> 00:54:48,080
Men in Africa wear dresses.

907
00:54:47,976 --> 00:54:51,879
Angels wear dresses.
Even the Pope wears a dress.

908
00:54:51,721 --> 00:54:54,490
All great masters
wear dresses.

909
00:54:54,379 --> 00:54:56,179
Are you going
to call up the Pope

910
00:54:56,106 --> 00:55:00,643
and tell him
not to wear his dress?

911
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:06,193
He's right,
the Pope does wear a dress.

912
00:55:06,029 --> 00:55:10,032
You're pathetic.
Both of you.

913
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:14,169
Go sit down.

914
00:55:14,351 --> 00:55:17,086
I us ed to think Dino left you
for that tramp, Donna Marie,

915
00:55:16,976 --> 00:55:19,278
because you got fat.
But you're more than fat,

916
00:55:19,185 --> 00:55:21,453
you're insane.
You're both insane!

917
00:55:21,362 --> 00:55:23,796
Dino did not leave me
for that tramp.

918
00:55:23,698 --> 00:55:26,867
- Oh, yes, he did!
- He still loves me.

919
00:55:26,738 --> 00:55:30,775
No, he doesn't!
They're engaged.

920
00:55:30,612 --> 00:55:32,946
And nobody loves you, Angela.
Nobody!

921
00:55:32,852 --> 00:55:33,819
Now...

922
00:55:35,285 --> 00:55:38,454
...when you go
to the regionals,

923
00:55:38,326 --> 00:55:40,761
you're going in a suit and tie.
Have I made myself clear?

924
00:55:40,663 --> 00:55:44,399
- He's engaged?
- I'm going to the regionals?

925
00:55:44,248 --> 00:55:45,782
You're going
all the way to the Pope.

926
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:47,187
If you try and do it
in a dress,

927
00:55:47,128 --> 00:55:51,825
I'll rip it off
your sweet little ass myself.

928
00:56:00,956 --> 00:56:05,483
Bruno: Come on, Mom.

929
00:56:16,704 --> 00:56:22,075
- Did you hear that?
- Let's go, Mom.

930
00:56:21,858 --> 00:56:23,725
- Gotcha!
- Happy Easter, homo!

931
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:26,285
- Come on, Mom.
- Bull's-eye!

932
00:56:26,178 --> 00:56:28,313
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

933
00:56:28,227 --> 00:56:31,429
Get in the car.

934
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,165
Oh, no!

935
00:56:34,597 --> 00:56:38,700
Bruno: Run faster, Mom.

936
00:56:38,534 --> 00:56:43,698
Come on, Mom,
they're throwing eggs.

937
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,327
Bitch, come on out!

938
00:56:48,264 --> 00:56:50,365
Come on, Mom,
you just got to start the car.

939
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:54,217
You fat bitch!

940
00:56:54,057 --> 00:56:55,792
Come on, you fat pig.

941
00:56:55,723 --> 00:56:57,223
Mom, please, help!

942
00:56:57,163 --> 00:57:01,333
- Please, get away.
- Start it!

943
00:57:01,164 --> 00:57:02,859
Get off!

944
00:57:02,860 --> 00:57:04,961
Boy: You little faggot.

945
00:57:04,876 --> 00:57:10,040
- Mom, just go faster!
- Get off!

946
00:57:11,983 --> 00:57:16,145
Kids: Get her!

947
00:57:27,859 --> 00:57:29,826
Hey, Murph,

948
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,415
tomorrow's my boy's birthday.

949
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:35,551
No kidding,
whatcha getting him?

950
00:57:35,381 --> 00:57:40,272
I'm thinking about
getting him a dress.

951
00:57:43,095 --> 00:57:45,196
Dispatch: Any unit respond...

952
00:57:45,111 --> 00:57:47,413
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

953
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:48,353
Dispatch:...possible hit and run.

954
00:57:48,312 --> 00:57:50,847
Hysterical female driver
left the scene.

955
00:57:50,745 --> 00:57:53,780
1970 Cadillac,
yellow convertible

956
00:57:53,657 --> 00:58:00,926
License plates, 'D-I-V-A.'
Parked at residence.

957
00:58:26,658 --> 00:58:29,026
Mrs. Battaglia:
Stop that sissy singing.

958
00:58:28,931 --> 00:58:30,899
Oh, Mom, I want to sing
with the angels.

959
00:58:30,819 --> 00:58:33,621
No son of mine is going
to grow up to be an opera singer.

960
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:34,908
You're going to make
something of yourself.

961
00:58:34,852 --> 00:58:36,519
- Give me my record.
- No.

962
00:58:36,452 --> 00:58:38,287
- Give it to me.
- No, I said!

963
00:58:38,214 --> 00:58:40,482
- Stop it!
- Stop what? You're a sissy.

964
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:42,057
- I'm not a sissy.
- You are a sissy.

965
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:48,348
No, don't say that.
Don't call me that.

966
00:59:06,253 --> 00:59:07,853
Here you go, ma'am.

967
00:59:07,789 --> 00:59:09,657
Where's Dino?
Where's my husband?

968
00:59:09,582 --> 00:59:12,250
I need Dino!
I need him!

969
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:14,744
- He's on another call.
- I need Dino!

970
00:59:14,639 --> 00:59:17,474
He's back at the station,
Angela.

971
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:19,862
- I need him, Benny.
- He didn't want to come.

972
00:59:19,761 --> 00:59:21,428
- I need him!
- I tried.

973
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:23,662
- Please!
- Angela, calm down.

974
00:59:23,569 --> 00:59:25,203
- Please!
- I tried. I tried!

975
00:59:25,138 --> 00:59:28,274
How could you
do this to me?

976
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:29,380
You gotta get
my husband.

977
00:59:29,331 --> 00:59:32,166
You gotta get him.
You gotta get my husband.

978
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:32,951
He won't come.

979
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:34,851
- Mrs. Battaglia.
- Just get him.

980
00:59:34,773 --> 00:59:37,374
Please, please, please.

981
00:59:37,269 --> 00:59:41,005
- You gotta get him.
- Angela, please.

982
00:59:40,854 --> 00:59:43,189
You gotta get my--

983
00:59:43,095 --> 00:59:44,289
Angela?

984
00:59:46,007 --> 00:59:47,304
Mom!

985
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,815
Mom!

986
00:59:55,801 --> 00:59:57,325
Dino...!

987
01:00:32,836 --> 01:00:37,439
Didn't your mommy get you shoes
to match the dress?

988
01:00:37,253 --> 01:00:38,880
Shut up.

989
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:55,919
Mr. Battaglia?

990
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,886
She's had a mild heart attack.

991
01:00:57,803 --> 01:01:00,805
She's okay, but we're going
to keep her here for a while.

992
01:01:00,683 --> 01:01:05,483
About a week.

993
01:01:09,453 --> 01:01:14,344
What about the kid?

994
01:01:22,097 --> 01:01:25,333
Come on.
I've had enough.

995
01:01:25,202 --> 01:01:27,203
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

996
01:01:27,122 --> 01:01:32,149
- Home.
- What about him?

997
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:37,586
What about him?

998
01:01:37,396 --> 01:01:40,098
This boy needs
a father, Dino.

999
01:01:39,989 --> 01:01:42,390
What the hell would you know

1000
01:01:42,294 --> 01:01:46,889
about what a little boy needs?

1001
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:52,566
Come on.

1002
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:07,824
Can I please see my mom?

1003
01:02:07,708 --> 01:02:09,910
I'm sorry, son,
she's sleeping right now.

1004
01:02:09,822 --> 01:02:12,256
Maybe tomorrow, okay?

1005
01:02:12,157 --> 01:02:17,116
I'll let you know
when she's stable.

1006
01:02:48,936 --> 01:02:54,737
Next thing we're gonna do
is get you the hell out of that dress.

1007
01:03:04,492 --> 01:03:08,495
Hey! Hey, kid!

1008
01:03:08,333 --> 01:03:13,724
- Man: Hey, move already!
- Up yours!

1009
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:23,681
You are gonna be so sorry

1010
01:03:23,601 --> 01:03:25,869
when I finally get
my hands on you!

1011
01:03:25,778 --> 01:03:29,380
I'm gonna make
such a man out of you!

1012
01:03:29,234 --> 01:03:31,065
Slow down!

1013
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:41,306
Sorry, kid,
but don't screw with me.

1014
01:03:47,511 --> 01:03:52,777
Bruno: What are you going
to do with that?

1015
01:03:54,777 --> 01:03:58,480
Your father's father ran the Star
Barbershop on Market Street.

1016
01:03:58,330 --> 01:04:02,566
When he died,
I had to take over.

1017
01:04:02,395 --> 01:04:09,095
People came from miles around
for one of my haircuts.

1018
01:04:11,197 --> 01:04:12,824
Mm-hmm.

1019
01:04:14,526 --> 01:04:15,593
I have a fresh
shirt for you

1020
01:04:15,551 --> 01:04:18,653
and a pair of pants
for school tomorrow.

1021
01:04:18,527 --> 01:04:20,695
I'm going
to school tomorrow?

1022
01:04:20,608 --> 01:04:22,609
Of course you're going
to school tomorrow.

1023
01:04:22,528 --> 01:04:25,063
It does not matter how many
words you know how to spell,

1024
01:04:24,961 --> 01:04:25,694
there's always more to learn.

1025
01:04:25,665 --> 01:04:28,266
You're going to make something
of yourself. Good night.

1026
01:04:28,161 --> 01:04:32,031
Good night, Helen.

1027
01:04:31,875 --> 01:04:33,943
Helen: Breakfast will be
on the table in the morning.

1028
01:04:33,860 --> 01:04:38,751
I'll see you after school.

1029
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:22,945
Son!

1030
01:05:29,682 --> 01:05:31,716
What are you doing here?

1031
01:05:31,634 --> 01:05:34,770
Your kid-- he didn't come home
from school today.

1032
01:05:34,643 --> 01:05:37,011
He's not at Angela's house.
He's not at my house.

1033
01:05:36,916 --> 01:05:40,051
I thought maybe you would know
where he would be.

1034
01:05:39,924 --> 01:05:43,627
Try looking in the girls'
department at Levy Brothers.

1035
01:05:43,478 --> 01:05:46,447
Don't be a smart ass.
I need your help.

1036
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:47,827
Why should I help?

1037
01:05:47,767 --> 01:05:49,435
Because he's your boy.

1038
01:05:49,368 --> 01:05:52,937
He's a sissy.

1039
01:05:52,792 --> 01:05:58,763
That's what he is.
He's a goddamned little sissy.

1040
01:05:58,521 --> 01:06:01,257
Just like me...

1041
01:06:01,147 --> 01:06:05,708
...remember?

1042
01:06:22,881 --> 01:06:27,646
You're not a sissy, Dino.

1043
01:06:37,572 --> 01:06:41,803
Find him yourself.

1044
01:06:57,961 --> 01:06:59,629
You're looking good.

1045
01:06:59,562 --> 01:07:01,359
Thanks.

1046
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:02,855
How are you feeling?

1047
01:07:02,795 --> 01:07:04,558
Fine.

1048
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:06,022
Is there anything
I can get for you?

1049
01:07:05,964 --> 01:07:07,090
No.

1050
01:07:07,116 --> 01:07:10,719
So what did the doctor say?
When are you getting out?

1051
01:07:10,573 --> 01:07:13,808
I don't know.
Next week.

1052
01:07:13,677 --> 01:07:15,979
So, has Bruno been around?

1053
01:07:15,886 --> 01:07:17,953
Not today yet.

1054
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:19,171
Where does the kid
like to hang out

1055
01:07:19,119 --> 01:07:21,020
in case he's sad,
or something?

1056
01:07:20,944 --> 01:07:27,041
He doesn't hang out anywhere.
He stays at home.

1057
01:07:27,249 --> 01:07:28,616
Okay, gotta go.

1058
01:07:28,562 --> 01:07:29,722
Helen?

1059
01:07:31,763 --> 01:07:36,033
I'm letting go
of Dino.

1060
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:41,160
I'm letting go
of your son.

1061
01:07:44,022 --> 01:07:45,580
Helen?

1062
01:07:46,806 --> 01:07:48,603
I mean it.

1063
01:07:49,719 --> 01:07:50,947
Good.

1064
01:07:54,297 --> 01:07:55,764
Bye.

1065
01:08:27,873 --> 01:08:29,607
Boy: Hey, guys,
there's a fight over here.

1066
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:34,268
You'd better come look
at this.

1067
01:08:35,651 --> 01:08:37,084
Hey!

1068
01:08:38,404 --> 01:08:40,998
Hey! Hey!

1069
01:08:40,964 --> 01:08:42,498
What going on here?

1070
01:08:42,437 --> 01:08:45,840
- You okay, kid?
- Yeah.

1071
01:08:45,702 --> 01:08:47,336
Go ahead.
Now...

1072
01:08:47,271 --> 01:08:49,538
does anybody here know
a Bruno Battaglia?

1073
01:08:49,446 --> 01:08:50,747
Who wants to know?

1074
01:08:50,695 --> 01:08:53,163
Never mind.
Has anybody seen him lately?

1075
01:08:53,064 --> 01:08:55,799
What's it to you, Butch?

1076
01:08:55,689 --> 01:08:58,491
Listen,
you shit-eating dickhead,

1077
01:08:58,377 --> 01:09:00,411
I asked you a question!

1078
01:09:00,330 --> 01:09:02,998
- I haven't seen him.
- What is your name, kid?

1079
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,392
- Eddie Mazzaratti.
- Well, Eddie Mazzaratti,

1080
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:07,192
if you should happen
to see Bruno Battaglia,

1081
01:09:07,116 --> 01:09:09,117
you tell him Helen
is looking for him!

1082
01:09:09,036 --> 01:09:11,204
You got it?
Have you got it?

1083
01:09:11,117 --> 01:09:12,984
- Yes.
- Okay! Who's next?

1084
01:09:12,909 --> 01:09:15,544
Boys: Run! Run!

1085
01:09:15,438 --> 01:09:20,431
Guys,
get me down from here!

1086
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,512
Hey, kid!

1087
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:12,403
Come on, kid,
let's go home.

1088
01:10:12,221 --> 01:10:13,347
Come on!

1089
01:10:31,938 --> 01:10:34,239
Why do you want to be
a little girl?

1090
01:10:34,147 --> 01:10:36,782
I don't want to be
a little girl.

1091
01:10:36,675 --> 01:10:38,809
What do you
want to be, then?

1092
01:10:38,724 --> 01:10:40,892
An etymologist.

1093
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,872
What the hell is that?

1094
01:10:42,789 --> 01:10:45,858
A scientist
of the derivation of words,

1095
01:10:45,734 --> 01:10:51,501
as to the history
of logistic forms.

1096
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:53,960
Whatever.

1097
01:10:55,912 --> 01:10:58,347
Why do you want
to wear these dresses?

1098
01:10:58,249 --> 01:11:03,153
Well, they're not dresses.
They're holy vestments.

1099
01:11:02,954 --> 01:11:05,856
They give me power.

1100
01:11:05,739 --> 01:11:07,306
What kind of power?

1101
01:11:07,243 --> 01:11:09,978
Well, the kind of power
that you have.

1102
01:11:09,868 --> 01:11:15,032
The power to be mean.

1103
01:11:18,318 --> 01:11:22,321
But when you wear
thes e holy vestment dresses,

1104
01:11:22,159 --> 01:11:23,860
people want to kill you.

1105
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:27,227
I don't care.

1106
01:11:27,088 --> 01:11:28,922
You don't care?

1107
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:34,487
No. I'm not afraid
of death.

1108
01:11:34,258 --> 01:11:36,059
You're not?

1109
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:37,454
No.

1110
01:11:44,181 --> 01:11:47,283
I like that.

1111
01:11:47,158 --> 01:11:51,685
That, I like.

1112
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:55,554
You know, for a little boy
who wears dresses,

1113
01:11:55,481 --> 01:11:57,915
you've got a hell
of a set of balls, kid.

1114
01:11:57,816 --> 01:11:59,647
I know.

1115
01:12:03,802 --> 01:12:07,738
Want a shot of whiskey?

1116
01:12:07,579 --> 01:12:09,046
Okay.

1117
01:12:09,052 --> 01:12:10,451
Okay.

1118
01:12:36,995 --> 01:12:41,565
Here's to you,
wearing your holy dresses,

1119
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:46,551
and to being you,
whatever the hell that might be.

1120
01:12:46,341 --> 01:12:51,141
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1121
01:13:08,139 --> 01:13:09,538
Ahem...

1122
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,933
You mind if I smoke?

1123
01:13:16,846 --> 01:13:18,313
No.

1124
01:13:19,278 --> 01:13:23,615
But it's gonna turn
your soul black.

1125
01:13:23,439 --> 01:13:25,304
Whatever.

1126
01:13:36,307 --> 01:13:38,875
Listen, if you're going
to continue wearing dresses

1127
01:13:38,772 --> 01:13:40,239
you and I are going
to have to teach you

1128
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:44,274
how to protect yourself.

1129
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:46,336
Um-hmm.

1130
01:13:46,325 --> 01:13:47,993
The point of this game is

1131
01:13:47,926 --> 01:13:50,761
you're supposed to hit me
before I hit you.

1132
01:13:50,647 --> 01:13:55,517
Okay?
Have you got it?

1133
01:13:55,319 --> 01:13:59,743
Put up your dukes!

1134
01:14:10,652 --> 01:14:11,846
Hello.

1135
01:14:11,868 --> 01:14:14,303
Oh, you're Shawniqua
Van Adams.

1136
01:14:14,205 --> 01:14:15,672
Where are your parents?

1137
01:14:15,613 --> 01:14:17,347
My mommy's dead

1138
01:14:17,278 --> 01:14:19,679
and my daddy
lives in Afghanistan.

1139
01:14:19,582 --> 01:14:21,049
Who takes care of you?

1140
01:14:20,990 --> 01:14:23,492
My brother, Henry.
He graduated college.

1141
01:14:23,391 --> 01:14:27,952
Oh, he's one of us.

1142
01:14:29,921 --> 01:14:31,455
You're big.

1143
01:14:31,394 --> 01:14:36,762
You're black.

1144
01:14:44,549 --> 01:14:45,883
Helen: The more glitter
the better.

1145
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:47,863
Henry:
It's very Diana.

1146
01:14:47,781 --> 01:14:50,283
If we're gonna do Diana,
we're gonna do Diana bigger.

1147
01:14:50,182 --> 01:14:51,949
Bruno: The more glitter,
the more glamour.

1148
01:14:51,879 --> 01:14:53,079
Henry: Miss Ross,
eat your heart out.

1149
01:14:53,031 --> 01:14:55,666
Hand me another needle and
give me the buttonhole thread.

1150
01:14:55,559 --> 01:15:00,597
Mom, I have to sew
the zipper on by hand.

1151
01:15:00,393 --> 01:15:03,862
Careful of the sequins,
Helen.

1152
01:15:03,722 --> 01:15:06,457
Are you gonna cut the fabric
on the crossgrain or the grain?

1153
01:15:06,347 --> 01:15:08,415
- Crossgrain.
- Good, I can get a crossgrain.

1154
01:15:08,331 --> 01:15:09,931
We have to make
every single

1155
01:15:09,867 --> 01:15:12,869
buck I've invested pay off.

1156
01:15:12,748 --> 01:15:15,483
This hat's never gonna do.

1157
01:15:15,373 --> 01:15:17,942
I wonder if I should
relax that wig?

1158
01:15:17,838 --> 01:15:21,073
Do you like the wig, Bruno?

1159
01:15:20,942 --> 01:15:22,977
Bruno, what do you
think of the wig?

1160
01:15:22,895 --> 01:15:24,055
It's good.

1161
01:15:24,079 --> 01:15:29,539
Helen: I think we'd better
tease it higher.

1162
01:15:30,257 --> 01:15:31,349
Good.

1163
01:15:31,377 --> 01:15:33,174
Fluff it.

1164
01:15:34,418 --> 01:15:36,085
Good afternoon...

1165
01:15:36,019 --> 01:15:38,854
and welcome to the Manhattan
competition

1166
01:15:38,739 --> 01:15:41,140
of the 33rd Annual

1167
01:15:41,043 --> 01:15:46,935
National Catholic
Spelling Championship.

1168
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:57,635
Nun: All of our little boys
and girls have worked

1169
01:15:57,528 --> 01:15:59,996
very hard to represent
their schools.

1170
01:15:59,896 --> 01:16:03,199
And we are very proud
of them.

1171
01:16:03,066 --> 01:16:06,201
But only one from this district
will get to go on

1172
01:16:06,074 --> 01:16:09,977
to compete in the state
competition next week.

1173
01:16:09,819 --> 01:16:13,188
So... let's give a warm
round of applause

1174
01:16:13,052 --> 01:16:16,254
to the smartest
little girls and boys

1175
01:16:16,125 --> 01:16:20,890
from District 79.

1176
01:16:54,151 --> 01:16:58,387
Boy: It's a boy!

1177
01:16:58,216 --> 01:17:03,346
Yay, Bruno.
You go.

1178
01:17:04,522 --> 01:17:05,750
Don't.

1179
01:17:05,770 --> 01:17:06,870
Get out of my way.

1180
01:17:06,826 --> 01:17:10,662
Don't do to him
what I did to you.

1181
01:17:10,507 --> 01:17:12,542
He wants to sing.

1182
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:14,360
Let him.

1183
01:17:14,348 --> 01:17:19,409
Let your son sing.

1184
01:17:21,486 --> 01:17:25,089
Nun: What the heck do you
think you're doing?

1185
01:17:24,944 --> 01:17:28,936
Come over here.

1186
01:17:32,497 --> 01:17:37,388
Let him go.

1187
01:17:39,027 --> 01:17:42,229
I said, let him go.

1188
01:17:42,100 --> 01:17:47,161
You don't let him go,
you'd better start praying.

1189
01:17:50,230 --> 01:17:52,665
Now, for those of you
who don't know it,

1190
01:17:52,566 --> 01:17:56,836
this is a little boy,
a little boy in a dress.

1191
01:17:56,664 --> 01:18:01,998
Anybody got a problem
with that can leave.

1192
01:18:21,662 --> 01:18:26,166
May I please have
my wig back now?

1193
01:18:25,983 --> 01:18:32,046
Give the kid his hair.

1194
01:18:35,234 --> 01:18:37,835
Bruno: Sometimes
when you least expect it,

1195
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:39,331
a miracle happens.

1196
01:18:39,267 --> 01:18:41,468
And people be come elucidated.

1197
01:18:41,379 --> 01:18:44,381
They understand.

1198
01:18:44,260 --> 01:18:48,821
Now let's start
this friggin' bee.

1199
01:18:51,046 --> 01:18:56,540
Will the first contestant
please stand up?

1200
01:18:56,391 --> 01:18:58,759
Reporter: Bruno, wait,
just a few questions.

1201
01:18:58,664 --> 01:19:00,332
- Make it quick.
- Why do you wear a dress?

1202
01:19:00,265 --> 01:19:01,832
- Don't tell them.
- How did it feel to win in a dress?

1203
01:19:01,769 --> 01:19:02,701
Good.

1204
01:19:02,729 --> 01:19:04,029
Do you plan to wear
a dress to the next one?

1205
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:05,244
That's enough of that.

1206
01:19:05,194 --> 01:19:06,761
- One photo.
- All right, one photo.

1207
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:09,400
Hold up your trophy.
Higher, kid, higher.

1208
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:10,725
Show them what
you're made of.

1209
01:19:10,667 --> 01:19:15,904
Great, that's it.
Are you from "Hard Copy"?

1210
01:19:15,692 --> 01:19:21,857
Oh, God, help me.

1211
01:19:33,361 --> 01:19:34,528
Helen:
We need to make you royal.

1212
01:19:34,482 --> 01:19:36,816
- More meretricious.
- Yeah, more of that.

1213
01:19:36,722 --> 01:19:38,556
And more regal
and more royal, too.

1214
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:42,474
- That's what I said.
- Yeah, whatever.

1215
01:19:44,244 --> 01:19:45,845
Bruno: Sovereign.

1216
01:19:45,780 --> 01:19:47,648
Splendid, like you, Helen.

1217
01:19:47,573 --> 01:19:48,839
I'm imperious.

1218
01:19:48,789 --> 01:19:53,748
- That'll work.
- Magnificent.

1219
01:19:58,136 --> 01:20:00,704
- Superb!
- Lavish!

1220
01:20:00,601 --> 01:20:03,269
- Munificent!
- Outrageous!

1221
01:20:03,161 --> 01:20:06,230
Helen: I crown thee, Bruno,
Queen of the Bees.

1222
01:20:06,106 --> 01:20:08,240
Bruno rules.

1223
01:20:08,154 --> 01:20:11,223
Woman: Here they come!

1224
01:20:11,099 --> 01:20:17,271
- Look this way into the camera.
- Where's your father?

1225
01:20:17,021 --> 01:20:20,090
- Who makes your dresses?
- Are you ready for fame, kid?

1226
01:20:19,966 --> 01:20:23,001
Well, it's ready for you.
Let's move.

1227
01:20:22,878 --> 01:20:24,278
Out of the way of the kid.

1228
01:20:24,222 --> 01:20:25,556
Don't mess with the kid
or the dress.

1229
01:20:25,503 --> 01:20:27,070
Are you from "Hard Copy"?

1230
01:20:27,007 --> 01:20:29,342
Watch out!
Give us some room!

1231
01:20:29,248 --> 01:20:31,349
Do not touch the dress.

1232
01:20:31,264 --> 01:20:37,156
- That's my son!
- Come on, Angela.

1233
01:20:38,755 --> 01:20:40,856
Do you have time
for an interview?

1234
01:20:40,771 --> 01:20:41,871
All right, quick.

1235
01:20:41,827 --> 01:20:43,528
Would you mind
stepping up?

1236
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:46,095
Okay, hike it up.

1237
01:20:45,989 --> 01:20:48,257
I'm standing here
with Bruno Battaglia,

1238
01:20:48,165 --> 01:20:49,932
the 8-year-old,
cross-dressing

1239
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,296
spelling bee champion,
dressed like a queen,

1240
01:20:52,198 --> 01:20:54,900
formerly from Queens,
and some might say

1241
01:20:54,791 --> 01:20:56,591
he is a little queen.

1242
01:20:56,519 --> 01:20:57,611
Nope.

1243
01:20:57,639 --> 01:20:59,440
Okay, well, Bruno,
can you at least tell us

1244
01:20:59,368 --> 01:21:01,736
how did you come
to want to wear dresses?

1245
01:21:01,641 --> 01:21:04,743
It came to me in a dream.

1246
01:21:04,617 --> 01:21:06,852
Could you describe
this dream for us?

1247
01:21:06,762 --> 01:21:08,562
- Uh, no.
- Mrs. Battaglia!

1248
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:10,558
What's it like
seeing your son in drag?

1249
01:21:10,475 --> 01:21:13,811
I think it is
absolute beauty.

1250
01:21:13,676 --> 01:21:17,912
He looks a hell of a lot
better than you do.

1251
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,541
Aren't you afraid
of what might happen to you

1252
01:21:19,469 --> 01:21:20,903
if you keep
wearing dresses?

1253
01:21:20,846 --> 01:21:22,711
No.

1254
01:21:22,702 --> 01:21:25,270
What if you lose?
Will you continue to wear dresses?

1255
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,934
I'm not gonna lose.

1256
01:21:26,863 --> 01:21:28,262
Yeah.

1257
01:21:28,272 --> 01:21:30,306
- Where's your father?
- No.

1258
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:32,592
You don't ask that kind of question.
That's private.

1259
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:33,964
What about
the planned protest?

1260
01:21:33,905 --> 01:21:35,972
The religious right says
they're going to form

1261
01:21:35,889 --> 01:21:38,624
a human barricade
in Washington to stop you.

1262
01:21:38,514 --> 01:21:40,182
Nope, nobody's going
to stop us.

1263
01:21:40,115 --> 01:21:42,449
Nobody.
Get that clear.

1264
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:46,325
Hey, Bruno,
are you gay?

1265
01:21:46,164 --> 01:21:48,999
I said, are you gay?

1266
01:21:48,885 --> 01:21:54,447
You know what I taught you.
Go get the little dickhead.

1267
01:22:06,298 --> 01:22:11,168
Kick his ass, Eddie,
come on!

1268
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:12,529
Ha!

1269
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:16,931
This is Shelia Ribando Fire,
reporting that Bruno Battaglia

1270
01:22:16,796 --> 01:22:18,296
has just won the right

1271
01:22:18,236 --> 01:22:21,172
to go all the way
to Washington DC in a dress.

1272
01:22:21,054 --> 01:22:26,354
Bob and Sue, back to you.

1273
01:23:03,305 --> 01:23:06,574
- Are you all right, Mom?
- Yeah. You?

1274
01:23:06,442 --> 01:23:07,500
Yeah.

1275
01:23:07,530 --> 01:23:14,127
"Wear a dress. Go to hell!"

1276
01:23:49,077 --> 01:23:52,479
Nice outfit.
Like it.

1277
01:23:52,341 --> 01:23:56,278
You should be ashamed!

1278
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:58,654
Officer:
Back those people up.

1279
01:23:58,552 --> 01:24:00,386
This way, folks.

1280
01:24:00,312 --> 01:24:04,348
Hello, everyone,
welcome.

1281
01:24:04,185 --> 01:24:07,020
Well, hello, Bruno,
we've been waiting for you.

1282
01:24:06,905 --> 01:24:08,395
Thank you.

1283
01:24:08,409 --> 01:24:10,210
What a very nice outfit.

1284
01:24:10,138 --> 01:24:11,765
Thank you.

1285
01:24:11,771 --> 01:24:15,874
Right this way. Sister Mary
Vivianna will show you in.

1286
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:16,808
She has seats
for all of you.

1287
01:24:16,764 --> 01:24:18,498
You come with me, Bruno.

1288
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:22,386
Mary Vivianna:
Come along, now.

1289
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:34,771
Sit down.

1290
01:24:34,785 --> 01:24:40,279
I can't believe this.

1291
01:24:40,258 --> 01:24:46,218
Okay, children,
wait here for the curtain.

1292
01:24:46,372 --> 01:24:50,899
Boy: Where's he going?

1293
01:24:55,046 --> 01:24:56,980
O-kay.

1294
01:25:10,122 --> 01:25:12,991
Host:

from all over
the country.

1299
01:25:22,382 --> 01:25:25,651
Only one will win
an all expense paid trip

1300
01:25:25,518 --> 01:25:28,119
to the Vatican City
in Rome,

1301
01:25:28,015 --> 01:25:33,019
and a private audience
with Pope John Paul II.

1302
01:25:32,816 --> 01:25:35,418
So have a warm welcome
for all our contestants.

1303
01:25:35,313 --> 01:25:40,681
Girl: Is he okay?

1304
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:47,094
Nun: Everybody back in line.
Here we go.

1305
01:26:01,304 --> 01:26:02,637
Host:
Will the first contestant

1306
01:26:02,584 --> 01:26:07,509
please step up
to the microphone?

1307
01:26:14,491 --> 01:26:17,293
The first word
is "filiciform."

1308
01:26:17,180 --> 01:26:20,148
Boy: Filiciform.
Definition, please.

1309
01:26:20,028 --> 01:26:23,898
"Shaped like a fern,
or fern frond."

1310
01:26:23,742 --> 01:26:25,276
Can I have
the language of origin?

1311
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:26,613
Latin.

1312
01:26:26,623 --> 01:26:29,458
- Can you repeat it?
- Filiciform.

1313
01:26:29,343 --> 01:26:33,146
Filiciform.

Filiciform.

1318
01:26:42,723 --> 01:26:45,258
That is incorrect.

F-I-L-I-

1320
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:51,409

Next contestant.

1322
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:58,337
"Penury."

1323
01:27:00,167 --> 01:27:02,101
Does this word
mean poverty?

1324
01:27:02,024 --> 01:27:04,192
Or scantiness.

1325
01:27:04,104 --> 01:27:06,873
Would you please
use it in a sentence?

1326
01:27:06,761 --> 01:27:09,729
"Emma could not
understand

1327
01:27:09,610 --> 01:27:12,145
why Jane chose
the mortification

1328
01:27:12,042 --> 01:27:14,911
of Mrs. Elton's notice...

1329
01:27:14,796 --> 01:27:18,432
and the penury
of her conversation

1330
01:27:18,285 --> 01:27:21,120
rather than return
to those who loved her

1331
01:27:21,005 --> 01:27:26,396
with real,
generous affection."

1332
01:27:26,382 --> 01:27:28,577
Penury.

1333
01:27:31,376 --> 01:27:34,812

U-R...

1336
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:40,288
...Y.
Penury.

1337
01:27:40,178 --> 01:27:41,645
Correct.

1338
01:27:42,706 --> 01:27:46,843
She was good.

1339
01:27:46,676 --> 01:27:47,809
Next contestant...

1340
01:27:47,764 --> 01:27:49,165
Is that the correct
pronunciation?

1341
01:27:49,109 --> 01:27:50,709
Next contestant...

1342
01:27:50,644 --> 01:27:52,245

"Lederhosen."

1345
01:28:19,900 --> 01:28:25,064
Host: Do you need
the definition?

1346
01:28:28,927 --> 01:28:31,028
Knee length leather trousers

1347
01:28:30,943 --> 01:28:36,607
worn especially in Bavaria?

1348
01:28:39,938 --> 01:28:42,106
Lederhosen.

...B-I-F-Y.

1355
01:29:06,793 --> 01:29:09,294
- Pompousness.
- That is correct.

1356
01:29:09,193 --> 01:29:11,361
May I please have
the language of origin?

1357
01:29:11,274 --> 01:29:13,675
- Next contestant.
- Is that word from the Greek?

1358
01:29:13,578 --> 01:29:15,880
- Vociferate.
- That's incorrect.

1359
01:29:15,788 --> 01:29:17,789
May I have the part
of speech for that word?

1360
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:21,210
That is incorrect.

1361
01:29:21,068 --> 01:29:22,433
Bye bye.

1362
01:29:22,445 --> 01:29:26,782

1367

That's incorrect.

1369

Next contestant.

1370
01:29:55,029 --> 01:29:59,760
"Typhlology."

01:30:00,247 --> 01:30:02,949
Typhlology.

1372
01:30:02,840 --> 01:30:05,074
May I please have
the definition?

1373

in a sentence?

that certain
nutritional deficiencies

can result
in the clouding

1378
01:30:21,533 --> 01:30:24,201
and softening
of the cornea."

1379
01:30:24,093 --> 01:30:26,328
Am I hearing
this word correctly?

1380
01:30:26,238 --> 01:30:31,470
- Um-hmm.
- Come on.

Final contestant,
please.

1390
01:31:10,346 --> 01:31:13,581
If Bruno Battaglia spells
this word correctly,

1391
01:31:13,450 --> 01:31:14,784
he will be the winner
and champion

1392

The word
is "melanocomous."

1395
01:31:41,266 --> 01:31:42,790
Whoa.

1396
01:31:42,802 --> 01:31:45,070
Melanocomous?

1397
01:31:44,979 --> 01:31:46,546
Having dark
or black hair.

1398
01:31:46,483 --> 01:31:48,083
- Melanocomous.
- Like you.

1399
01:31:48,019 --> 01:31:49,281
Yeah.

1400
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,034

- melanocomous people."
- Melanocomous?

1404
01:32:02,007 --> 01:32:03,774
