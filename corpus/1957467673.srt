1
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,572
Looks like you need a tow.

2
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,010
Is that a pig?

3
00:01:39,011 --> 00:01:41,012
Well, if it's a dog,
then I need glasses.

4
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,319
I need a phone.

5
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,842
Where am I anyway?

6
00:01:44,843 --> 00:01:47,018
Haven Falls.

7
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,237
Haven Falls?

8
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:50,284
Last time I checked.

9
00:02:13,742 --> 00:02:14,786
You okay, fella?

10
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:18,180
Maybe.

11
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:20,139
Where's that church?

12
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,575
Can you take me there?

13
00:02:21,576 --> 00:02:24,926
Well, I do fancy
myself a modern woman,

14
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:28,451
but normally I date someone
before a trip to the chapel.

15
00:02:28,452 --> 00:02:31,193
You know, dinner, the movies,

16
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:33,978
maybe even a Christmas
party or two.

17
00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:37,504
I've got one week to write
the jingle of the season.

18
00:02:37,505 --> 00:02:39,332
You take me to that chapel,

19
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,334
I'll take you to the movies.

20
00:02:41,335 --> 00:02:42,510
I promise.

21
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:46,208
Your friend have a name?

22
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:47,775
Come on, Penelope.

23
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,734
Penelope?

24
00:03:00,092 --> 00:03:01,354
Candy for breakfast?

25
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,790
It's Christmas.

26
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:04,183
Candy canes are allowed
at any time of day.

27
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,662
Everybody knows that.

28
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:09,100
Do they or is it just
your excuse to eat sweets 24/7?

29
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:12,408
For me theseare the best
part about Christmas.

30
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:15,455
Oh, yeah, keeps you away from
all the mushy, feel good parts.

31
00:03:15,456 --> 00:03:17,326
Exactly.

32
00:03:17,327 --> 00:03:19,372
I don't subscribe to
the artificial sweetness,

33
00:03:19,373 --> 00:03:23,027
but delicious
Christmas sugar cookies?

34
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,464
Those are the facts
I can support.

35
00:03:24,465 --> 00:03:25,726
You ready for the meeting?

36
00:03:25,727 --> 00:03:26,727
Got your holiday pitch?

37
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:28,555
I do. Yeah, it's great.

38
00:03:28,556 --> 00:03:31,297
It's, uh...
It's really newsworthy.

39
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:32,776
Do you think Dennis will agree?

40
00:03:32,777 --> 00:03:36,606
Absolutely.
Dennis is going to love it.

41
00:03:36,607 --> 00:03:38,391
Right after I convince him to.

42
00:03:38,392 --> 00:03:41,394
Come on, everyone.
Meeting's about to begin.

43
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:43,048
Alright. Shall we?

44
00:03:49,664 --> 00:03:51,360
Jen, you're up.

45
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:54,494
Holiday hot yoga,
it's a growing trend.

46
00:03:54,495 --> 00:03:55,930
Studies show it
eliminates toxins

47
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:57,497
and burns extra calories.

48
00:03:57,498 --> 00:04:00,543
It's perfect for people who
overindulge at Christmas.

49
00:04:00,544 --> 00:04:02,632
Great!
Let's make that a priority.

50
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:05,026
Next up, Alli Blakeman.

51
00:04:05,027 --> 00:04:08,551
What do you have for us in
travel and entertainment?

52
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:12,338
Well, a bit of a pivot,
actually.

53
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:15,950
I have come across a study,
an exciting study

54
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:18,953
that will blow your mind.

55
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:22,826
Scientists have made incredible
medical advancements using

56
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:25,481
ultra violet light.

57
00:04:25,482 --> 00:04:28,963
Do they these lights
in a new Christmas movie?

58
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:30,965
Well, no, but...

59
00:04:30,966 --> 00:04:33,359
Are they offering them at
the world's most charming

60
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,795
Christmas destination?

61
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:38,842
Uh... No. No, they are not.

62
00:04:38,843 --> 00:04:40,540
Mm.

63
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,063
Alright team.

64
00:04:42,064 --> 00:04:45,240
Consider Christmas
officially kicked off.

65
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:46,241
Meeting adjourned.

66
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:52,378
Alli, hang back.

67
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,294
Don't worry.
It's Christmas. He'll be nice.

68
00:04:57,384 --> 00:04:59,428
Alli, you're a great writer.

69
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:02,388
That's why I hired you
in travel and entertainment.

70
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:06,305
And I'm so grateful to write for

71
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,308
a big platform
like The Sentinel,

72
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,832
but, Dennis, the news team
is where I belong.

73
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:13,486
The news team wins Pulitzers.

74
00:05:13,487 --> 00:05:15,836
That is my dream.

75
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,404
I want to make
a difference in the world.

76
00:05:18,405 --> 00:05:20,580
You have loyal readers.

77
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:23,931
Your work makes
a difference to them.

78
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,281
Of course.

79
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:28,979
Of course, Dennis.

80
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,416
Okay. I'll tell you what.

81
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:34,333
I have a story I need covered.

82
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,335
You do a good job,

83
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,989
and I'll consider you for
transfer to the news division.

84
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,513
Really?!

85
00:05:40,514 --> 00:05:42,297
Oh, my God. Dennis, I could...

86
00:05:42,298 --> 00:05:44,212
I won't,
because it's inappropriate,

87
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:46,171
but thank you!

88
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,218
What's the story?

89
00:05:50,219 --> 00:05:54,309
Well, this year marks the 65th
anniversary of the movie

90
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,310
Christmas With You.

91
00:05:55,311 --> 00:05:56,442
Okay.

92
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:57,921
It was filmed in
White Falls, New York.

93
00:05:57,922 --> 00:05:59,662
They even premiered it
at a local theater.

94
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:02,883
I want you to go up there
and write a piece.

95
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:04,580
Okay. On an old movie?

96
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:06,495
It's still a holiday classic.

97
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:07,496
You do know it, right?

98
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:08,845
Of course.

99
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,630
You can't escape that song,
it's everywhere.

100
00:06:10,631 --> 00:06:12,414
Personally,
I think it's a bit over-played.

101
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:15,156
It's my wife's favorite.

102
00:06:15,157 --> 00:06:17,680
I see.

103
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,640
Well then, consider it
an honor to report on it.

104
00:06:20,641 --> 00:06:22,990
Dennis, this going to is be

105
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:24,774
the best article
I've ever written,

106
00:06:24,775 --> 00:06:28,517
and you will see that I
belong on the news team.

107
00:06:28,518 --> 00:06:30,563
I said I'd consider it.

108
00:06:30,564 --> 00:06:32,174
That's good enough for me.

109
00:06:43,533 --> 00:06:45,491
What happened? What'd he say?

110
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,797
Dennis gave me an assignment,

111
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:49,625
covering the holiday classic
Christmas With You.

112
00:06:49,626 --> 00:06:51,105
Shouldn't you be
stress eating fruit cake?

113
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,498
That's everything
you want to avoid.

114
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:53,978
Well, we made a deal.

115
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,633
Dennis is giving me
a shot at the news,

116
00:06:57,634 --> 00:07:00,201
if I write an incredible
Christmas With You article.

117
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:01,594
That's great!

118
00:07:01,595 --> 00:07:03,857
Yeah, yeah.

119
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:06,076
See, he wants me to
go up to White Falls.

120
00:07:06,077 --> 00:07:07,600
You know,
where they shot the movie.

121
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:08,558
Where's that?

122
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,124
It's like an hour north,

123
00:07:10,125 --> 00:07:12,256
but I don't want a movie set,
I want a story.

124
00:07:12,257 --> 00:07:14,345
One that'll really show
Dennis my potential.

125
00:07:14,346 --> 00:07:16,435
You should interview
Walter Andrews.

126
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,002
I heard he lives at
a fancy hotel in the Hamptons.

127
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,874
Really?

128
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:23,746
Everyone loves
a where are they now story.

129
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:26,967
Okay. Uh-huh.

130
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:28,925
Good old Walter
still has a publicist.

131
00:07:28,926 --> 00:07:31,450
That's actors.
They never miss an opportunity

132
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,843
to bask in the limelight.

133
00:07:37,021 --> 00:07:40,546
Hi, this Alli Blakeman
from The Sentinel.

134
00:07:40,547 --> 00:07:42,330
Yes, I was hoping to
get an interview with

135
00:07:42,331 --> 00:07:45,681
Walter Andrews regarding
the 65th anniversary of

136
00:07:45,682 --> 00:07:46,944
""Christmas with You."

137
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,341
Well, it would be a feel good
piece honoring both the song

138
00:07:53,342 --> 00:07:54,342
and the movie, and...

139
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:59,870
I see.
Well, thank you for your time.

140
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:03,613
So, you're not packing
your bags for the Hamptons?

141
00:08:06,703 --> 00:08:08,356
Apparently Walter
hates the press

142
00:08:08,357 --> 00:08:10,314
and wouldn't speak to me
even if Santa asked him to.

143
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:13,013
Sounds like you can't
escape White Falls.

144
00:08:13,014 --> 00:08:14,294
Small towns are
fun at Christmas.

145
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:24,452
♪

146
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,770
Excuse me.

147
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:33,381
I'm looking for
the White Falls Inn.

148
00:08:33,382 --> 00:08:35,514
Could you point me in
the right direction?

149
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:37,341
Oh, here for the holidays?

150
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:39,909
No, work actually.

151
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,998
Oh. Well, you just hang a right,

152
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:44,653
keep walking past
the church over the bridge

153
00:08:44,654 --> 00:08:45,959
and then take
a left on Main Street.

154
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,309
It is on your left.

155
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,224
Okay. Thanks.

156
00:08:50,225 --> 00:08:52,705
What kind of work?
If you don't mind me asking.

157
00:08:52,706 --> 00:08:57,013
Well, I'm writing a story
on Christmas With You.

158
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,755
Yeah, I read online that
there's a tour of the locations

159
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:00,975
where the movie was shot.

160
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:05,674
This is White Falls right?

161
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:09,504
Oh, yes, yes, the movie
was filmed here ages ago.

162
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:12,638
I can't remember when
they last did tours.

163
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:15,641
Oh.

164
00:09:15,642 --> 00:09:17,381
But you could check out
the Westdale theater.

165
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,079
That's where
the movie premiered.

166
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,820
I think they have
some memorabilia.

167
00:09:20,821 --> 00:09:22,430
The owners are big fans.

168
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,345
The Westdale?

169
00:09:24,346 --> 00:09:26,042
It's just down from
the inn on the right.

170
00:09:26,043 --> 00:09:27,348
You cannot miss it.

171
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:30,569
Okay. Thanks.

172
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,067
Uh.

173
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:56,596
Excuse me.

174
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:01,948
- Excuse me?
- Oh!

175
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:04,341
I'm so sorry.

176
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,302
In my defense, you did startle
a man on top of a ladder.

177
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,826
Well, here's your A.

178
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:11,871
Okay. Thank you.

179
00:10:11,872 --> 00:10:12,915
And...

180
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:13,916
My E and my S.

181
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:15,875
Here, E and your S.

182
00:10:15,876 --> 00:10:19,008
Brad Westdale.
Welcome to our theater.

183
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:20,531
First showing's at 2:00pm.

184
00:10:20,532 --> 00:10:22,446
Alli Blakeman.
But I'm not here to see a movie.

185
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:24,753
I work for The Sentinel
and am writing an article

186
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:26,015
on Christmas With You.

187
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:28,409
Well, you're in the right place.

188
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:30,150
It premiered at this
theater 65 years ago.

189
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:33,457
Great, do you mind
if I take a tour?

190
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:36,330
Sure. As long as this is
not one of those hit pieces.

191
00:10:36,331 --> 00:10:38,462
"25 Reasons Why Old Movies
Are Only For Boomers,"

192
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,465
"How Old Hollywood
Promotes Flat Earth Theory."

193
00:10:41,466 --> 00:10:44,033
Not at all.

194
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,427
I'm just here for the facts,
unless you've have evidence

195
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,690
about flat earth, in which case
I'm sorry but the world

196
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:50,431
needs to know.

197
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:52,259
Come on.

198
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:57,699
♪

199
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,310
Ooh, do I smell kettle corn?

200
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,790
Even better.

201
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,792
This is Santa's popcorn.

202
00:11:03,793 --> 00:11:05,664
A Westdale classic.

203
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,841
Instead of butter
we drizzle marshmallow

204
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:11,060
and then add in some
Christmas candies.

205
00:11:11,061 --> 00:11:12,758
Kids love it.

206
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:14,281
Marshmallow on popcorn?

207
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,718
Yeah! My great grandfather
was from France,

208
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,981
and apparently that's
where marshmallow are from.

209
00:11:18,982 --> 00:11:20,941
My grandma had it
on everything as a kid.

210
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:29,818
Mm.

211
00:11:29,819 --> 00:11:30,819
Mm!

212
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,647
Who would have thunk it?

213
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:35,519
I would come here
every day just for this.

214
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,652
Let's see. Okay.

215
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,785
Uh, great.

216
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:41,439
Come on.

217
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,921
Who's uncle Brad's new friend?

218
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:50,099
She's a very pretty friend.

219
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,493
Alli, let me introduce you to
the theater's official

220
00:11:52,494 --> 00:11:53,713
decorating team.

221
00:11:55,192 --> 00:11:57,280
This is my grandma, Margaret,
my sister, Tracy,

222
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:59,805
and my niece,
our little star, Chloe.

223
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:01,632
Ah, very nice to meet you.

224
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:02,895
You, too.

225
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:05,680
Alli is writing
an article for The Sentinel

226
00:12:05,681 --> 00:12:06,855
on the Christmas With You
anniversary.

227
00:12:06,856 --> 00:12:09,031
That's my favorite movie.

228
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:12,643
So the whole family works here?

229
00:12:12,644 --> 00:12:15,777
Oh. Yes, dear, but Brad does
all the heavy lifting.

230
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:16,996
- Ah.
- It's true.

231
00:12:16,997 --> 00:12:17,954
Always has to.

232
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:19,215
When he was a kid, remember?

233
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:20,608
We could not get
him to come home.

234
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,088
I'm right here.
You don't have to talk about me

235
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,698
in the third person.

236
00:12:23,699 --> 00:12:26,048
He took his first
steps right over there.

237
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:28,616
Practically ran into
the theater itself.

238
00:12:28,617 --> 00:12:29,835
That's right.

239
00:12:29,836 --> 00:12:31,010
Oh, Gran, do you remember
when he got fell

240
00:12:31,011 --> 00:12:32,838
into the candy case?

241
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:35,449
Right in there, Alli.

242
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,799
Alright now. Alli is here for
Hollywood history, not mine.

243
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,454
Yes, although I do enjoy
seeing you sweat a bit,

244
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:43,109
I'm here for the facts about
Christmas With You.

245
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,719
Ask anything.

246
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,590
It's our favorite
part of Christmas.

247
00:12:46,591 --> 00:12:48,897
Come on, let me show you
behind the curtain.

248
00:12:48,898 --> 00:12:50,986
There's no Oz. Just me.

249
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:51,987
It's nice to meet you guys.

250
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:54,903
- You, too.
- Bye-bye.

251
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,384
The projector room.

252
00:12:57,385 --> 00:13:00,474
Where man and machine do
a highly choreographed dance.

253
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,128
Sounds like a sci-fi movie.

254
00:13:02,129 --> 00:13:03,956
Well, the projectionist has
to make sure the reel changes

255
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:05,827
are done at exactly
the precise time

256
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,656
otherwise the illusion
is broken.

257
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:09,962
And to think all these
little still frames

258
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:12,921
can hold so much power.

259
00:13:12,922 --> 00:13:14,401
Yeah, it's a movie.

260
00:13:14,402 --> 00:13:16,143
It's a time machine.

261
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:20,929
Movies can take you anywhere,
you just gotta let 'em.

262
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:24,541
To Casablanca or the Titanic

263
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,848
or maybe just singing
a song in the rain.

264
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,937
Clear fan of the classics, huh?

265
00:13:28,938 --> 00:13:30,721
Mm-hm.

266
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:32,201
They were glamorous,
but don't you think movies

267
00:13:32,202 --> 00:13:33,855
were far-fetched back then?

268
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,379
Unrealistic versions of life?

269
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,555
And Star Wars is a documentary?

270
00:13:38,556 --> 00:13:40,079
Touché.

271
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,471
But people don't break out
into a song and dance

272
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:43,909
under street lamps.
That would be weird.

273
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:46,172
Not when you're telling
the girl of your dreams

274
00:13:46,173 --> 00:13:48,478
that she's your Christmas Star,
you know?

275
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:51,090
Shining her light on love.

276
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:52,526
Speaking of which.

277
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:54,615
That scene was filmed
right outside our theater.

278
00:13:54,616 --> 00:13:58,967
Okay, that was a sweet moment
in Christmas With You.

279
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,012
Sweet?

280
00:14:00,013 --> 00:14:01,883
It was iconic.

281
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:05,713
I'm looking for
a story not a scene.

282
00:14:05,714 --> 00:14:07,889
The movie is the story.

283
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:10,196
Okay, I've been in
rooms with people from

284
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:14,200
all different walks of life
and they all find

285
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:16,550
common ground with this movie.

286
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:17,899
That's powerful.

287
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:21,424
Well, Christmas is
the most popular holiday.

288
00:14:21,425 --> 00:14:26,038
True, but the movies bring
it to another level, right?

289
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,127
Like anything is
possible at Christmas.

290
00:14:28,128 --> 00:14:31,521
You make it sound so easy.

291
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:33,349
Maybe it is.

292
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,831
Picture this,
the lights are dimming,

293
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:39,268
signaling the show is starting.

294
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,792
You take your popcorn
and make your way

295
00:14:41,793 --> 00:14:43,272
down to the theater.

296
00:14:43,273 --> 00:14:46,972
Well, I do like the popcorn.

297
00:14:54,502 --> 00:14:55,503
After you.

298
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:00,159
It's such a charming theater.

299
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,291
It's more than just a theater.

300
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,772
It's a a tele-porter.

301
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:08,297
Here. Take a seat. Let me...
Let me paint a picture for you.

302
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:11,779
Alright you have my attention.

303
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,564
Okay, so, when the lights lower

304
00:15:14,565 --> 00:15:16,697
and the screen
flickers with images,

305
00:15:16,698 --> 00:15:21,354
everyone in this room
takes off on a journey.

306
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,270
We follow a hero
or heroine as they

307
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:26,837
tackle a life changing event,
fall in love,

308
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:29,971
and in the end this
entire theater believes

309
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:32,800
that happy endings do exist.

310
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:36,064
And then the lights go up

311
00:15:36,065 --> 00:15:38,545
and everyone is back to reality.

312
00:15:38,546 --> 00:15:43,202
Sure, but with a renewed
sense that magic is possible.

313
00:15:43,203 --> 00:15:46,727
Like a kid on Christmas morning.

314
00:15:46,728 --> 00:15:50,078
I don't know if they
have that much power.

315
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,340
I mean, they're just movies.

316
00:15:51,341 --> 00:15:52,994
They don't have to be.

317
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:57,825
And you think everyone walks out
of here with that same feeling?

318
00:15:57,826 --> 00:16:00,132
Yeah! I mean,
Christmas and the movies,

319
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:01,916
both deliver happy endings.

320
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:05,789
And what's your happy ending?

321
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,358
For White Falls to reclaim
its place in cinematic history.

322
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,099
Mm-hm.

323
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,146
My grandma used to tell a story
about how the whole town used to

324
00:16:14,147 --> 00:16:16,800
go out celebrating
the movie and Christmas.

325
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:19,065
There was so much holiday pride.

326
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:24,417
Over the years all
that just disappeared.

327
00:16:24,418 --> 00:16:26,288
Well, people still
watch the movie.

328
00:16:26,289 --> 00:16:28,160
I mean, it's always on TV.

329
00:16:28,161 --> 00:16:29,988
It's not the same.

330
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,772
I've wanted to throw
a big screening like this

331
00:16:31,773 --> 00:16:33,339
for a while now

332
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:36,081
So, when the studio restored it,
I jumped at the chance.

333
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:40,737
So, all of this is
for White Falls?

334
00:16:40,738 --> 00:16:42,739
Well, and my grandma.

335
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,654
It's her favorite movie.

336
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:46,439
Always reminds her of
the importance of love.

337
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,050
Can I use that for my story?

338
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,574
Sure. Yeah.

339
00:16:51,575 --> 00:16:53,228
You know, a good article
in The Sentinel might just be

340
00:16:53,229 --> 00:16:56,014
the Christmas miracle we need.

341
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,580
And who knows, if you come,
maybe by the end of the night

342
00:16:57,581 --> 00:16:59,843
you'll be shouting
from the rooftops like in

343
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:01,454
Christmas With You.

344
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:04,196
No, no, no. See, that is
something you will definitely

345
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:07,025
only see in the movies.

346
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,549
I don't know.

347
00:17:13,336 --> 00:17:15,424
This is a room with
a few stories.

348
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:17,470
Hah.

349
00:17:17,471 --> 00:17:19,038
Hm.

350
00:17:20,474 --> 00:17:22,041
Wow.

351
00:17:24,347 --> 00:17:26,566
They don't make dresses
like that anymore.

352
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,263
No, they do not.

353
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:31,614
Did you collect all this?

354
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:36,097
My grandparents started it,
but I've kept up the tradition.

355
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:38,534
I love this. May I?

356
00:17:38,535 --> 00:17:40,145
Yeah, go ahead.

357
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:42,409
Very old Hollywood.

358
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:50,024
Have you ever thought
about branching out?

359
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:52,983
You know, beyond White Falls.

360
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,681
Well, I did get an offer from

361
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,117
the Film Archival Institute
in D.C.

362
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:57,640
Oh.

363
00:17:57,641 --> 00:18:00,295
But I don't know if
I'm a big city guy.

364
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:02,428
It just feels so cold.

365
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:04,038
It's no colder than White Falls.

366
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,561
Not like that.

367
00:18:05,562 --> 00:18:07,085
I mean, you see all
these people together,

368
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,521
but do they really
know each other?

369
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:12,220
Well, that would be impossible.

370
00:18:12,221 --> 00:18:13,874
Oh, you know,
walking down the street

371
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:15,484
and knowing your
neighbors is nice, though.

372
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:17,444
Christmas is about togetherness.

373
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,668
Walter Andrews, so handsome.

374
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:27,975
Do you have any
stories about him?

375
00:18:27,976 --> 00:18:31,196
Well, my grandma was actually
the one who convinced him

376
00:18:31,197 --> 00:18:33,198
to have the movie premiere here.

377
00:18:33,199 --> 00:18:34,982
- Really?
- Yeah.

378
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:36,114
She worked as the ticket
taker at the time

379
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,290
and one day she asked him.

380
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,292
Now you tell me.

381
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:41,815
Well, she's modest about it,

382
00:18:41,816 --> 00:18:43,904
but the town was so
thrilled at the notoriety

383
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:46,820
that they gifted the theater
to my grandparents afterwards.

384
00:18:46,821 --> 00:18:49,083
No wonder it's your
grandmother's favorite movie.

385
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:52,608
How did your grandfather
feel about her chatting up

386
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,263
Hollywood's most
notorious ladies' man?

387
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,004
I don't think he worried.

388
00:18:57,005 --> 00:18:59,311
They knew they were soul mates
the moment they met.

389
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:01,400
Ah, that's romantic.

390
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,184
Their love story
was the real deal.

391
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,751
Even better than the movies.

392
00:19:04,752 --> 00:19:09,016
Coming from you,
that says a lot.

393
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,061
Is this the original?

394
00:19:11,062 --> 00:19:12,062
Because it looks handwritten.

395
00:19:12,063 --> 00:19:14,108
Yeah, it is.

396
00:19:14,109 --> 00:19:17,938
The was actually supposed to
just be a generic studio tune,

397
00:19:17,939 --> 00:19:20,810
but Walter Andrews wrote this
while filming in White Falls

398
00:19:20,811 --> 00:19:23,900
one day, and insisted
that it be in the movie.

399
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:26,338
Huh. Would you mind
if I took a photo?

400
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:28,383
Go ahead.

401
00:19:28,384 --> 00:19:30,517
You can... if you want me to...

402
00:19:31,474 --> 00:19:34,302
Oh, I'm so sorry.

403
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:36,392
It's okay. It's fine.

404
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:40,830
What's this?

405
00:19:40,831 --> 00:19:42,181
I don't know.

406
00:19:45,096 --> 00:19:48,577
"My Dearest D,
I wrote this song for you."

407
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:51,450
Run away with me.

408
00:19:51,451 --> 00:19:53,147
I'll give it all up for you.

409
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:55,410
Let's spend the rest of
our Christmases together.

410
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:58,371
"I love you. W.A."

411
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:03,810
W.A. is obviously
Walter Andrews, but who is D?

412
00:20:03,811 --> 00:20:05,551
I don't know.

413
00:20:05,552 --> 00:20:07,292
Maybe somebody that
worked on the film with him?

414
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,771
What do you think?

415
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,078
I think this is serendipity.

416
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,036
Everyone loves an origin story.

417
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:15,996
Imagine who inspired
one of the most famous

418
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:17,867
Christmas songs of all time?

419
00:20:17,868 --> 00:20:20,261
And as far as I know,
Walter Andrews never married

420
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:22,698
after he filmed this movie.

421
00:20:22,699 --> 00:20:25,179
I mean, the three previous
divorces probably destroyed

422
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,746
his faith in marriage.

423
00:20:26,747 --> 00:20:29,749
Or "D" is a little heartbreaker

424
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,055
and he never felt he
could fall in love again.

425
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:35,276
This is a good story
waiting to be told.

426
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:38,540
This has been here for
as long as I can remember.

427
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:41,151
Maybe my grandma would know.

428
00:20:41,152 --> 00:20:42,283
Here. Come on.

429
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:43,589
Thank you.

430
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:44,894
Do you know what you want?

431
00:20:44,895 --> 00:20:45,982
Yes.

432
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,680
What do you want?
Is it a secret?

433
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:52,075
No. I want a toy drum
with a remote

434
00:20:52,076 --> 00:20:53,729
and a model airplane.

435
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,992
Oh, my gosh. That's fantastic.

436
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,734
- What a good choice.
- Hey, Grandma, wait up.

437
00:20:58,735 --> 00:21:01,084
The sheet music from
Christmas With You,

438
00:21:01,085 --> 00:21:02,999
we found a dedication
on the back.

439
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,305
We found a love letter,
actually.

440
00:21:04,306 --> 00:21:05,306
Have you ever seen it?

441
00:21:05,307 --> 00:21:07,874
I've no idea.

442
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,790
Walter was friendly
with many ladies.

443
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:13,749
Okay, is there anybody with
the name D that you remember?

444
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,057
So many people
worked on that movie,

445
00:21:17,058 --> 00:21:18,319
It's hard to tell.

446
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,278
It is a lovely note.

447
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,888
Yeah.

448
00:21:21,889 --> 00:21:23,716
How romantic to have
Hollywood's biggest star

449
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:24,847
write a song for you?

450
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,588
That's every girl's dream.

451
00:21:26,589 --> 00:21:29,548
Well, maybe some,
but right now it's this

452
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:32,856
this girl's dream to meet Santa.

453
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:36,772
If you have any luck,
let me know. Bye.

454
00:21:36,773 --> 00:21:38,644
Bye.

455
00:21:38,645 --> 00:21:40,733
I have to find out right?

456
00:21:40,734 --> 00:21:42,474
I mean this song is
a holiday treasure.

457
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,606
I don't even know what
Christmas is like without it.

458
00:21:44,607 --> 00:21:46,173
I'm going to
hit the town tomorrow

459
00:21:46,174 --> 00:21:48,001
and start questioning
possible witnesses.

460
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:50,395
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Maybe a softer approach?

461
00:21:50,396 --> 00:21:52,397
This isn't Law and Order.

462
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,137
No, but I am solving a mystery.

463
00:21:54,138 --> 00:21:58,316
Yeah, but this story
affects more than just you.

464
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,361
Let me help.

465
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:02,495
Alright.

466
00:22:04,148 --> 00:22:06,411
I guess I could use an expert.

467
00:22:06,412 --> 00:22:08,064
I have some work
to do at my hotel.

468
00:22:08,065 --> 00:22:10,153
Could I meet you
here tomorrow morning?

469
00:22:10,154 --> 00:22:11,416
It's a date.

470
00:22:11,417 --> 00:22:13,853
As in date and time.

471
00:22:13,854 --> 00:22:16,072
Totally professional of course.

472
00:22:16,073 --> 00:22:17,596
Of course.

473
00:22:17,597 --> 00:22:19,032
I will be here.

474
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,033
Okay.

475
00:22:30,523 --> 00:22:32,088
Hey, Alli,
how's the story coming?

476
00:22:32,089 --> 00:22:35,091
Good! Great! Um...

477
00:22:35,092 --> 00:22:36,832
I came across
something exciting.

478
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:38,312
This isn't one of
your pivots is it?

479
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:40,532
Yes, but a Christmas one.

480
00:22:40,533 --> 00:22:43,839
Better be. Shoot.

481
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,015
Okay. So, I was researching
in White Falls today

482
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:49,105
and I came across an original
music sheet from the theme song

483
00:22:49,106 --> 00:22:50,106
for Christmas With You.

484
00:22:50,107 --> 00:22:53,936
Okay, and?

485
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:55,851
There was a handwritten
love letter from Walter Andrews

486
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:58,332
on the back. Turns out he
wrote the song for someone.

487
00:22:58,333 --> 00:22:59,812
A real someone.

488
00:22:59,813 --> 00:23:01,074
The letter implied
that he was willing to

489
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:03,511
give up anything
for his lady love.

490
00:23:03,512 --> 00:23:05,731
Really? And who is she?

491
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,386
Well, that's the mystery.

492
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,519
All we know is that her name
starts with the letter "D."

493
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,434
You are tenacious.

494
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:14,914
Okay, you got two weeks.

495
00:23:14,915 --> 00:23:17,960
Make it count.
We publish Christmas Eve.

496
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:19,876
I will. Thank you, Dennis.

497
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,403
Yes!

498
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,424
You've been busy.

499
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,208
Thought I'd get a head start.

500
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:49,949
None of the articles
mention anyone with a name

501
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:51,864
starting with D.

502
00:23:51,865 --> 00:23:53,648
Maybe it was his
co-star Lana Murdock

503
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,868
and he called her "doll?"

504
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:57,391
No, that's doubtful.
I researched Lana.

505
00:23:57,392 --> 00:23:58,914
She was pregnant during filming,

506
00:23:58,915 --> 00:24:00,568
and her husband was
with her on location.

507
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:02,831
And you couldn't find the cast
and crew listed online?

508
00:24:02,832 --> 00:24:04,920
No dancer #3 named Doris?

509
00:24:04,921 --> 00:24:06,574
Well, unfortunately,
it wasn't that detailed.

510
00:24:06,575 --> 00:24:09,142
The only D names listed were in
post-production or accounting.

511
00:24:09,143 --> 00:24:11,579
Hopefully we'll get some
information from the locals.

512
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,973
Where should we start?

513
00:24:15,410 --> 00:24:16,455
Right here.

514
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:19,152
Thank you.

515
00:24:19,153 --> 00:24:21,371
You got it.

516
00:24:21,372 --> 00:24:24,331
You know, his is where
Jack and Betsy fell in love.

517
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,159
Jack and Betsy, huh?

518
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,074
The lead characters
from the movie.

519
00:24:28,075 --> 00:24:32,078
Right, sorry I got distracted
by all these sweets.

520
00:24:32,079 --> 00:24:33,122
Hello, Brad.

521
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:34,167
Hi, Mrs. Caldwell.

522
00:24:34,168 --> 00:24:37,213
Now, what can I help
you with today?

523
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,737
We're interested in any
memories you may have of

524
00:24:38,738 --> 00:24:40,129
Christmas With You.

525
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,218
Oh, you've come to
pick my brain, huh?

526
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:43,655
Yes, ma'am.

527
00:24:43,656 --> 00:24:45,265
Is this about the screening?

528
00:24:45,266 --> 00:24:46,701
Yes and no.

529
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,747
Hi, my name's Alli Blakeman,

530
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:50,749
I'm a reporter
from The Sentinel.

531
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,534
I'm actually writing
an article on the movie.

532
00:24:53,535 --> 00:24:55,623
How would you feel about
answering a few questions?

533
00:24:55,624 --> 00:24:58,060
- Oh, sure.
- Great.

534
00:24:58,061 --> 00:25:02,064
Do you remember any of
the cast and crew from the film?

535
00:25:02,065 --> 00:25:06,721
Everyone knew the stars
Walter Andrews and Lana Murdock.

536
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:10,682
She was gorgeous
and he was so personable

537
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:14,208
that sometimes it was hard to
believe he was such a big star.

538
00:25:15,818 --> 00:25:18,646
And do you recall anyone with
the name starting with "D"

539
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,605
that was close to Mr. Andrews?

540
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:24,913
Mm, no. I mean, there was always
so many people around him,

541
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:28,351
and I just remember
watching the filming,

542
00:25:28,352 --> 00:25:33,008
and he was magical.
They were magical.

543
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:37,273
And, oh,
that song gets me every time.

544
00:25:37,274 --> 00:25:40,712
♪ All in time,
we'll see what's meant to be ♪

545
00:25:40,713 --> 00:25:44,454
I mean how could
a big city ad man

546
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:48,458
and a farm girl
rewrite destiny like that?

547
00:25:48,459 --> 00:25:52,637
That is a good question.

548
00:25:52,638 --> 00:25:53,986
Now, Mrs. Caldwell.

549
00:25:53,987 --> 00:25:55,335
Mm-hm.

550
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:57,293
Try and think back.

551
00:25:57,294 --> 00:26:01,559
Is there anyone in particular
you remember hanging around him?

552
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,474
Maybe a romantic interest?

553
00:26:04,475 --> 00:26:06,607
Uhh...

554
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,653
I'm not sure.

555
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:10,263
Maybe.

556
00:26:10,264 --> 00:26:12,352
Mrs. Caldwell,
do you still offer

557
00:26:12,353 --> 00:26:14,484
the gingerbread house building?

558
00:26:14,485 --> 00:26:15,443
Like the one from the movie?

559
00:26:15,444 --> 00:26:16,965
I do.

560
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:18,488
I'll bring one right out.

561
00:26:18,489 --> 00:26:21,361
Amazing. Thank you.

562
00:26:21,362 --> 00:26:22,884
Do we really have time for this?

563
00:26:22,885 --> 00:26:24,886
Dial back on the interrogation.

564
00:26:24,887 --> 00:26:27,410
Familiar settings
trigger memories.

565
00:26:27,411 --> 00:26:28,890
She'll start talking.

566
00:26:28,891 --> 00:26:32,328
Walter Andrews
decorated at least

567
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:34,853
five of these during the shoot.

568
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:38,292
He would always give me candy
when my mom wasn't looking.

569
00:26:39,467 --> 00:26:41,033
Seem like he was a nice guy.

570
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:45,559
Oh, yeah, he bought the entire
crew Christmas cookies.

571
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,779
My parents were thrilled.

572
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,345
He gave us a lot of orders.

573
00:26:49,346 --> 00:26:52,131
Always cookies?

574
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:55,656
Mostly, but during the premiere
he had a cake made.

575
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:59,704
It was red velvet with
green and white frosting.

576
00:26:59,705 --> 00:27:03,185
He special ordered it
and was very secretive about it.

577
00:27:03,186 --> 00:27:06,362
I think it was
a surprise for someone.

578
00:27:06,363 --> 00:27:07,625
Did you deliver it?

579
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,931
No. He came
and he picked it up himself.

580
00:27:09,932 --> 00:27:11,846
I remember it was
after the store closed

581
00:27:11,847 --> 00:27:13,935
and I was there with Dad.

582
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:16,198
My mother kept
excellent records.

583
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:20,594
I'm going to check and see what
I can find in the back.

584
00:27:20,595 --> 00:27:22,117
Awesome. Thank you.

585
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:24,032
- Wow.
- Hey.

586
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:26,905
Go ahead, say I told ya so.

587
00:27:26,906 --> 00:27:29,429
Well, we don't have
a name just yet.

588
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,562
Once she comes back,
we should get going.

589
00:27:32,563 --> 00:27:34,260
Why? We're having fun.

590
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:37,176
Hey, hey! You're eating
the last of our roof.

591
00:27:37,177 --> 00:27:40,309
Oh, well. I've always been
more of a minimalist.

592
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,833
So, where did you
get the sweet tooth?

593
00:27:41,834 --> 00:27:43,312
Mom or dad?

594
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:46,751
Mm, I think they were
probably the cause.

595
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,361
Oh, yeah?

596
00:27:48,362 --> 00:27:52,191
Yeah, my... my parents
divorced when I was younger.

597
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,673
Is that why you're not
a Christmas fanatic?

598
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:58,893
You know, Christmas for me,
it was always more about

599
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:00,416
separation than togetherness.

600
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:03,681
I guess not really
knowing where you belong

601
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,987
sort of sours the festivities.

602
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,467
But don't worry, I'm fine.
I'm good.

603
00:28:07,468 --> 00:28:09,774
You know, I found
my place in journalism.

604
00:28:09,775 --> 00:28:10,906
That's what matters to me.

605
00:28:12,516 --> 00:28:14,039
Facts over feelings.

606
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,041
Less disappointment that way.

607
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:18,739
What about escapism?

608
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,568
Mm. You can't outrun the truth.

609
00:28:21,569 --> 00:28:22,830
Why try?

610
00:28:22,831 --> 00:28:24,963
Maybe not, but it's nice to

611
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:27,226
take a break every now and then.

612
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:35,190
Alright, so, before you go,
there's nothing on the cake,

613
00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:38,585
but I found something
from the movie that has

614
00:28:38,586 --> 00:28:40,195
a lot of names on it.

615
00:28:40,196 --> 00:28:42,763
I think that it was from
the day that they shot here.

616
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:45,374
Maybe it'll help?

617
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:46,898
It's a call sheet. Yes!

618
00:28:46,899 --> 00:28:50,118
Oh, great.
Well, then, you can use it,

619
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:51,946
- but bring it back.
- I'll take this.

620
00:28:51,947 --> 00:28:53,469
Please be careful.

621
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,471
We will guard this with
our lives, Mrs. Caldwell.

622
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:58,300
- Thank you.
- Okay. Alright now.

623
00:28:58,301 --> 00:28:59,475
Thank you.

624
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:01,651
Okay, research and coffee?
What do you say?

625
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:03,698
Yes, with a fine-toothed comb.

626
00:29:05,352 --> 00:29:07,092
There are three D names
on the call sheet.

627
00:29:07,093 --> 00:29:08,833
Debbie, Dolores, Diana.

628
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:10,704
One of them has to be our lady.

629
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:13,794
It's a sign!

630
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:15,013
What?

631
00:29:15,014 --> 00:29:17,624
The street lamp.
It just turned on.

632
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,539
Yes, because it is dusk.

633
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,670
How is that a sign?

634
00:29:20,671 --> 00:29:22,063
Oh, come on, you know.

635
00:29:22,064 --> 00:29:24,065
This is where
the iconic scene from

636
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,545
Christmas With You takes place.

637
00:29:25,546 --> 00:29:27,155
This is the streetlight.

638
00:29:27,156 --> 00:29:28,330
Huh.

639
00:29:28,331 --> 00:29:30,071
Picture it.

640
00:29:30,072 --> 00:29:32,204
Jack has just fallen
in love with Betsy.

641
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:34,684
She inspires him to write
his greatest love song

642
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:37,209
and he sings it to her right
here under this street lamp.

643
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,080
His Christmas gift to her.

644
00:29:39,081 --> 00:29:42,040
Now, Jack has a fiancé
back in New York,

645
00:29:42,041 --> 00:29:44,216
but Betsy gives him life,
you know?

646
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:46,522
Makes him believe in love again.

647
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:50,352
He belts his heart out to her,
they dance in the street.

648
00:29:50,353 --> 00:29:53,573
Betsy tells him that she
never knew her heart could sing.

649
00:29:53,574 --> 00:29:55,662
And he can't help himself,
he kisses her.

650
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,839
And this is right before he goes
back to his fiancé in the city.

651
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,189
Well, he's obligated to go back
because of the holiday

652
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,192
variety show, but we all
know he belongs with Betsy.

653
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:05,585
That's the drama.

654
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,413
And the street lamp?

655
00:30:07,414 --> 00:30:09,763
It's a metaphor for
the Christmas star

656
00:30:09,764 --> 00:30:10,851
bringing them together.

657
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:12,157
That's a stretch.

658
00:30:12,158 --> 00:30:14,637
It sets up their romance, right?

659
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:17,815
So, when he calls out
to her from the rooftop,

660
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,294
you believe it.

661
00:30:19,295 --> 00:30:22,994
In the freezing cold
like a crazy person.

662
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:24,387
Crazy in love at Christmas.

663
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:30,653
Alright,
in the spirit of Christmas,

664
00:30:30,654 --> 00:30:33,874
I'll take it as a sign.

665
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:37,225
And I'll also take that.

666
00:30:37,226 --> 00:30:39,925
Uh, why don't
I send you a picture?

667
00:30:42,057 --> 00:30:43,841
You really should trust me.

668
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:48,584
Okay. I'll meet you
here tomorrow morning?

669
00:30:48,585 --> 00:30:49,585
Sounds like a plan.

670
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,240
Okay. Send me a pic.

671
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,606
Debbie the make-up artist lives
between here and the city.

672
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,652
I've scheduled
a meeting for today.

673
00:31:12,653 --> 00:31:15,176
Dolores, the dancer,
unfortunately passed away,

674
00:31:15,177 --> 00:31:17,570
but I'm emailing you
her son's contact info.

675
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:20,225
Okay.
So, that leaves Diana Parker,

676
00:31:20,226 --> 00:31:22,880
the assistant location manager.

677
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,838
She might still be a local.

678
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,709
Maybe a different last name?

679
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:28,233
I'm so glad you're writing this.

680
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,539
It's such
an inspiring love story.

681
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,282
Between a big city ad man
and farmer's daughter?

682
00:31:34,283 --> 00:31:36,458
I mean, do you know
how unrealistic that is?

683
00:31:36,459 --> 00:31:38,373
That's what's great about it.

684
00:31:38,374 --> 00:31:40,549
The universe
wanted them together.

685
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,422
I mean, what are the odds
of his car breaking down

686
00:31:43,423 --> 00:31:45,903
just as she's walking
her pig across the street?

687
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,339
It's a movie.

688
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,471
Well, it's inspiring.

689
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:52,387
I need to surrender
my love life to Christmas,

690
00:31:52,388 --> 00:31:54,520
because the dating apps
are failing me.

691
00:31:54,521 --> 00:31:57,566
I've put in all my info,
right down to my favorite soap,

692
00:31:57,567 --> 00:32:00,700
and the best thing they
can match me with is Jimmy,

693
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,789
a part-time DJ
living with his mother.

694
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,617
Ooh. Yikes.

695
00:32:04,618 --> 00:32:07,185
How romantic would it be to
just take one look at someone

696
00:32:07,186 --> 00:32:10,144
and everything changes
for the better?

697
00:32:10,145 --> 00:32:12,190
And your heart sings
from the rooftops.

698
00:32:12,191 --> 00:32:14,627
Yes! That's what I want.

699
00:32:14,628 --> 00:32:16,803
My heart to sing.

700
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:18,761
That is movie love.

701
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,199
They roll credits
right before the divorce.

702
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,852
Everyone deserves romance.

703
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,376
Like Walter Andrews.

704
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,639
My life would be so much
easier if I could just

705
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,554
talk to that man.

706
00:32:28,555 --> 00:32:30,948
Alright. I have to run.

707
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,994
I'm meeting Brad, just text me
if you get any info, okay?

708
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:37,389
Oh, yeah? Brad? I googled him.

709
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,173
Why?

710
00:32:39,174 --> 00:32:41,088
Because you haven't been on
a date since you started here.

711
00:32:41,089 --> 00:32:43,699
It's not like that.

712
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,005
He's really cute.

713
00:32:45,006 --> 00:32:46,659
Give in to romance.

714
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,095
Bye, Jen.

715
00:32:52,492 --> 00:32:54,232
Brad: I can't believe
she's still doing make up.

716
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:57,757
It's for her granddaughter's
ballet recital, the Nutcracker.

717
00:32:57,758 --> 00:32:58,933
I think it's sweet.

718
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,937
There you go.

719
00:33:04,808 --> 00:33:05,984
Have a seat.

720
00:33:07,637 --> 00:33:08,637
Thank you.

721
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,292
They're cute.

722
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:14,078
Cute but exhausting.

723
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,862
Okay. Lay it on me, Doll.

724
00:33:15,863 --> 00:33:17,907
You said on the phone,
you're writing a story

725
00:33:17,908 --> 00:33:19,387
on Christmas With You?

726
00:33:19,388 --> 00:33:21,694
Yes, and thank you
so much for obliging.

727
00:33:21,695 --> 00:33:23,304
My pleasure.

728
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:25,437
That was a special
time in my life.

729
00:33:25,438 --> 00:33:28,788
Did you know Walter well?

730
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:31,921
That was our
only movie together.

731
00:33:31,922 --> 00:33:33,749
It was actually my first.

732
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,838
I was a nervous Nelly.

733
00:33:35,839 --> 00:33:38,667
He was so handsome.

734
00:33:38,668 --> 00:33:41,583
Some stars,
they need lots of makeup.

735
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,281
Not Walter.

736
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:46,327
He was a walking
streak of sex appeal.

737
00:33:46,328 --> 00:33:50,288
And charming,
gosh, that man could

738
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:52,204
outshine a Christmas tree.

739
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,989
All the girls adored him.

740
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,036
All the men wanted to be him.

741
00:33:59,646 --> 00:34:01,081
He was special.

742
00:34:01,082 --> 00:34:03,997
So, you two were close?

743
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,521
You do tend to get to know
someone when you powder

744
00:34:06,522 --> 00:34:08,915
their nose a hundred
times a day.

745
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,266
How close exactly?

746
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:15,661
Oh, I wasn't one of
the Walter girls

747
00:34:15,662 --> 00:34:18,665
if that's what you're asking.

748
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:23,234
I would have been.

749
00:34:23,235 --> 00:34:25,672
Mm. Happily.

750
00:34:27,848 --> 00:34:30,850
Unfortunately,
someone else caught his eye.

751
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:34,375
He was always
sneaking off from set.

752
00:34:34,376 --> 00:34:36,682
I had to cover
for him a few times.

753
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:39,076
And who was it?

754
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,774
Walter was very private.

755
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:43,819
I can't say I blame him.

756
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:47,388
The gossip rags were
always lurking for stories.

757
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:49,173
Fame can be
a double edged sword.

758
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:51,392
That's the truth.

759
00:34:51,393 --> 00:34:53,177
Whoever he was
seeing was special.

760
00:34:53,178 --> 00:34:56,093
He had love dancing in his eyes.

761
00:34:56,094 --> 00:35:00,358
When Walter sang that song
under the street lamp,

762
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:03,491
ah, we all fell in love.

763
00:35:03,492 --> 00:35:08,757
♪

764
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:10,542
Tracy:
I found those in the attic,

765
00:35:10,543 --> 00:35:12,021
and I asked Grandma if
Walter Andrews ever came back

766
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:13,327
to town after the premiere.

767
00:35:13,328 --> 00:35:15,677
She said no,
not to her knowledge.

768
00:35:15,678 --> 00:35:19,551
Maybe D took him up on his offer
and followed him to Hollywood.

769
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:21,074
Well, he never married again.

770
00:35:21,075 --> 00:35:22,771
You'd think he
would have if she did.

771
00:35:22,772 --> 00:35:25,296
It's true, and he didn't
give up his career.

772
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:28,037
I think she broke his heart.

773
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:30,823
He wrote the song
because he loved this woman

774
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:32,999
and was coming
back to her at all costs.

775
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,609
That's also
the plot of the movie.

776
00:35:34,610 --> 00:35:36,872
Walter's note
on the back tells me

777
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:38,570
it was more than just
a plot convenience.

778
00:35:38,571 --> 00:35:42,400
Uncle Brad,
come make the Christmas colors.

779
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:43,531
I would love to.

780
00:35:43,532 --> 00:35:45,577
Uh, it's Dolores's son.
I'm going to...

781
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:47,970
Great, yeah. Go ahead. Go ahead.

782
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,625
Lead the way, oh princess.
Let's go.

783
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:53,411
Yes, hello.
Thank you for calling me back.

784
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:54,716
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Here we go.

785
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:56,240
Right in the centre, right?

786
00:35:56,241 --> 00:36:00,157
Oh, I see. Yes. I understand.

787
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,420
And now say the magic wish.

788
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:05,162
Icicle, Icicle,
on a Christmas night,

789
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,773
grant me my wish
and show me your light.

790
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:11,778
Woo! You did it!
Wow, look at that.

791
00:36:13,736 --> 00:36:16,390
Whoa!

792
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,827
I'm dizzy, how about you?

793
00:36:18,828 --> 00:36:21,047
Okay, Chloe. Time to go.

794
00:36:21,048 --> 00:36:24,006
Oh, hey, go get your mama.

795
00:36:24,007 --> 00:36:27,097
Bye.

796
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:33,102
Hey, any...
Any luck with Dolores' son?

797
00:36:33,103 --> 00:36:35,366
Well, his parents
met on the movie.

798
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,932
They were both dancers.

799
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,717
Walter Andrews actually
sent them a wedding present.

800
00:36:38,718 --> 00:36:40,632
So, I'm knocking
Dolores off the list.

801
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:42,416
Cheer up, we still have Diana.

802
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,375
Well, we don't have
her contact information.

803
00:36:44,376 --> 00:36:46,115
She emailed me back.

804
00:36:46,116 --> 00:36:47,334
We can see her tomorrow.

805
00:36:47,335 --> 00:36:50,119
That's great.

806
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,949
By the way, that little
light show you did with Chloe,

807
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,342
that was really sweet.

808
00:36:55,343 --> 00:36:56,996
It's magical for a kid.

809
00:36:56,997 --> 00:36:59,999
If only adults
didn't know better, huh?

810
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,219
They don't have to.

811
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,351
You just gotta believe.

812
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,484
There's something I want
to show you on the way back.

813
00:37:06,485 --> 00:37:08,181
This is even better
than the light show.

814
00:37:08,182 --> 00:37:09,227
Come on.

815
00:37:14,971 --> 00:37:18,626
So, right here is where
they built the snowman

816
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:21,238
in Christmas With You.

817
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,544
No way. That was in a field.

818
00:37:23,545 --> 00:37:25,981
No, they put a matte
painting over this wall.

819
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,027
More tricks to make you believe.

820
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:30,377
One person's trick
is another's reality.

821
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:32,118
And magic is where you make it.

822
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:35,643
You, know, whether it's turning
a chandelier into a light show

823
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:37,906
or the side of a theatre
into a winter wonderland.

824
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:39,517
That's why movies
are so important,

825
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:41,040
they bring dreams to life

826
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,868
and to the faithful
in those seats,

827
00:37:42,869 --> 00:37:43,869
lives to dreams.

828
00:37:45,306 --> 00:37:46,698
When did you stop dreaming?

829
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,743
I dream.

830
00:37:48,744 --> 00:37:50,702
I have work ones all the time.

831
00:37:50,703 --> 00:37:53,226
Or I'm still in school

832
00:37:53,227 --> 00:37:55,228
and I forget to hand in a paper.

833
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,969
I mean in your life.

834
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:59,798
Says the man who spends all
his time in a dark theater?

835
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:01,713
Hey, I'm the guy
standing in the snow

836
00:38:01,714 --> 00:38:04,411
who sees a farmer's field.
Who are you?

837
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:08,459
The girl standing with him
starting to lose feeling in her

838
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:12,593
toes while seeing
her article dissolve

839
00:38:12,594 --> 00:38:14,073
like ice in the sun.

840
00:38:14,074 --> 00:38:16,034
See, no one that poetic
could write a bad article.

841
00:38:17,947 --> 00:38:19,818
What's it like to
be faith personified?

842
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:23,865
As I've said,
I just believe in happy endings.

843
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:27,434
And Christmas always delivers.

844
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:28,479
Ooh, yes please.

845
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,219
Hold on, hold on. Not yet.

846
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:32,918
Remember the scene where Jack
and Betsy both dropped their

847
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:34,180
candy canes
and then it formed a heart?

848
00:38:34,181 --> 00:38:36,008
Yeah.

849
00:38:36,009 --> 00:38:38,271
Okay, well, they borrowed that
tradition from White Falls,

850
00:38:38,272 --> 00:38:40,012
and if two people
drop their candy canes

851
00:38:40,013 --> 00:38:41,405
and it forms a heart,

852
00:38:41,406 --> 00:38:44,321
whatever they wish
will come true.

853
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,540
Okay, come on, they obviously
placed them in the snow

854
00:38:46,541 --> 00:38:47,628
for the movie.

855
00:38:47,629 --> 00:38:49,195
Come on, you first.

856
00:38:49,196 --> 00:38:51,328
We have wishes that
we need to come true.

857
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,460
- Okay.
- Close your eyes. Ready?

858
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:57,029
Count to three. One, two, three.

859
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,204
Drop.

860
00:38:58,205 --> 00:38:59,684
Okay.

861
00:38:59,685 --> 00:39:00,599
Now you?

862
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,382
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

863
00:39:02,383 --> 00:39:07,344
One, two, three. Drop.

864
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:09,737
Oh! What?!

865
00:39:09,738 --> 00:39:11,304
Come on,
you've done this before.

866
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:13,132
This is a rigged game, isn't it?

867
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:15,787
Never and no. It's magic.

868
00:39:15,788 --> 00:39:18,268
And now our dreams
will come true.

869
00:39:21,141 --> 00:39:22,924
Well, thanks for
trying to cheer me up,

870
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:25,144
but I should get
back to the inn.

871
00:39:25,145 --> 00:39:28,234
Um, Alli, tomorrow,

872
00:39:28,235 --> 00:39:30,062
do you want to go
to the White Falls

873
00:39:30,063 --> 00:39:31,933
Christmas tree lighting?

874
00:39:31,934 --> 00:39:33,065
No work.

875
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,936
Yeah.

876
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:38,070
Yeah, that would be fun. Okay.

877
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:39,114
Okay.

878
00:39:39,115 --> 00:39:40,594
Goodnight.

879
00:39:40,595 --> 00:39:43,729
Great. See you then.

880
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:48,210
Hey, you okay?

881
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:49,777
Yeah, I'm fine.

882
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,954
Your Christmas spirit
seems a little muted.

883
00:39:52,955 --> 00:39:57,306
The tree lighting used to be
packed with locals and tourists.

884
00:39:57,307 --> 00:39:58,569
I miss that.

885
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,788
It's still a fun event.

886
00:40:00,789 --> 00:40:03,878
It's all how you
look at it right?

887
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:07,621
I see a VIP Tree Lighting.

888
00:40:07,622 --> 00:40:10,624
Exclusive.

889
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:12,278
There's still
Christmas spirit here.

890
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:15,324
I mean, those sweaters there.

891
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,631
That took a lot of imagination.

892
00:40:17,632 --> 00:40:18,719
Yeah, you're right.

893
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,329
Hey, you want a movie fun fact?

894
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,940
Can I use it for my story?

895
00:40:21,941 --> 00:40:25,509
Maybe. You know the scene
where Jack buys the candy cane?

896
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:27,032
Mm-hm.

897
00:40:27,033 --> 00:40:28,903
It was actually filmed
at the Hardware Store.

898
00:40:28,904 --> 00:40:32,167
Oh. Was it a candy shop
once upon a time?

899
00:40:32,168 --> 00:40:33,995
Another movie magic trick.

900
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:35,562
Tourists used to come
and look for the candy store,

901
00:40:35,563 --> 00:40:39,610
never realizing it was just
created by a set designer.

902
00:40:39,611 --> 00:40:41,176
Hm. Well, I guess you can
transform anything if you have

903
00:40:41,177 --> 00:40:42,439
the right imagination.

904
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,919
Or anyone.

905
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,447
Come on.
You said no work tonight.

906
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:54,320
Well, I may have scheduled
to meet Diana here.

907
00:40:54,321 --> 00:40:57,976
She's a local. It's convenient.

908
00:40:57,977 --> 00:41:01,109
Come on, guys, the Christmas
tree is about to sparkle.

909
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:05,070
Oh, then she's
going to have to wait.

910
00:41:05,071 --> 00:41:08,595
Come on, let's enjoy
White Falls together.

911
00:41:08,596 --> 00:41:11,119
Three, two, one!

912
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,557
Sparkle!

913
00:41:16,256 --> 00:41:17,952
Let me get a photo of you guys.

914
00:41:17,953 --> 00:41:19,867
All the Westdale's,
get in there.

915
00:41:19,868 --> 00:41:22,870
- Yeah, thank you!
- That's nice.

916
00:41:22,871 --> 00:41:25,351
Oh, wait.
You need to be in it, too.

917
00:41:25,352 --> 00:41:28,093
- No, no, no, no. It's fine.
- Alli, come on.

918
00:41:28,094 --> 00:41:29,311
Yes, come on.

919
00:41:29,312 --> 00:41:31,226
Hey, Joyce. Do you mind
taking a photo for us?

920
00:41:31,227 --> 00:41:32,967
My pleasure!

921
00:41:32,968 --> 00:41:35,317
- Alli Blakeman.
- Thank you.

922
00:41:35,318 --> 00:41:36,623
Nice to see you again.

923
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:39,017
I see you found the Westdales.

924
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,671
I did.

925
00:41:40,672 --> 00:41:44,239
Okay, everyone say Christmas!

926
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,807
All: Christmas!

927
00:41:47,722 --> 00:41:49,114
Pretty as a Christmas card.

928
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,289
Thank you.

929
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,334
You all have a fun night.

930
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:56,425
Oh! It's Diana.

931
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:58,079
I know it's killing you. Go on.

932
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,039
Hi. Diana.

933
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:05,696
Diana! Hi.

934
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,088
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you in person.

935
00:42:07,089 --> 00:42:08,873
Nice to meet you, too.
Merry Christmas.

936
00:42:08,874 --> 00:42:09,874
Please, sit.

937
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:12,703
Thanks. Merry Christmas to you.

938
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,792
I'm so glad you're a local.

939
00:42:14,793 --> 00:42:18,447
Oh, yes, born and raised.

940
00:42:18,448 --> 00:42:22,626
So, you're writing an article
on Christmas With You.

941
00:42:22,627 --> 00:42:23,627
How's it going?

942
00:42:23,628 --> 00:42:25,193
Some roadblocks,

943
00:42:25,194 --> 00:42:27,631
but hopefully
that'll change soon.

944
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:29,894
So, you were location manager.

945
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:32,549
Did you ever meet
Walter Andrews?

946
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,595
I never got the chance.

947
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:37,423
I wish I did.

948
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:41,558
I'm actually looking
for who inspired the song.

949
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:45,910
I know Walter wrote it
while he was in town.

950
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:48,303
My cousin was his driver.

951
00:42:48,304 --> 00:42:52,177
I got an inside scoop
on all things Walter.

952
00:42:52,178 --> 00:42:56,398
Apparently, he would
take long walks at night.

953
00:42:56,399 --> 00:42:58,009
He would write best then.

954
00:42:58,010 --> 00:43:00,185
Did your cousin
ever mention driving

955
00:43:00,186 --> 00:43:02,230
Walter and a girlfriend?

956
00:43:02,231 --> 00:43:06,626
No. No, Walter was a private man

957
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:10,151
with a public life,

958
00:43:10,152 --> 00:43:13,415
a life that could
give him everything he wanted.

959
00:43:13,416 --> 00:43:16,810
Everything except
the one thing he yearned for.

960
00:43:16,811 --> 00:43:18,856
Which was?

961
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:21,903
To be like everybody else.

962
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,819
No flashbulbs,

963
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,735
no fancy parties,

964
00:43:28,736 --> 00:43:30,651
just the simple life.

965
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:33,611
To disappear really.

966
00:43:36,744 --> 00:43:40,660
The studio and the fame,

967
00:43:40,661 --> 00:43:42,184
it was like a cage.

968
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:46,840
Like some sort of colorful

969
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:48,974
bird in a gilded cage.

970
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,846
It was tragic really.

971
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:59,723
So, he never mentioned anything
about a special someone

972
00:43:59,724 --> 00:44:02,204
from White Falls to your cousin.

973
00:44:03,858 --> 00:44:08,514
Well, no, but it's funny now

974
00:44:08,515 --> 00:44:10,081
that you mention it.

975
00:44:10,082 --> 00:44:12,605
When my cousin drove
him back to the city,

976
00:44:12,606 --> 00:44:16,522
he asked Walter if he'd
signed his name in cement,

977
00:44:16,523 --> 00:44:19,351
ya know, like in Hollywood.

978
00:44:19,352 --> 00:44:22,006
Walter told him no,

979
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:25,923
but he did in White Falls,

980
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:27,446
where he left his heart.

981
00:44:27,447 --> 00:44:28,926
He never elaborated.

982
00:44:28,927 --> 00:44:31,580
We just assumed
he loved the city.

983
00:44:31,581 --> 00:44:33,844
Can I speak to your cousin?

984
00:44:33,845 --> 00:44:36,673
Sadly, he passed.

985
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:39,371
We tried to find where Walter
may have signed his name,

986
00:44:39,372 --> 00:44:40,894
but never did.

987
00:44:40,895 --> 00:44:43,681
Thank you, Diana.

988
00:44:45,030 --> 00:44:46,814
You may have saved my story.

989
00:44:49,164 --> 00:44:50,730
Brad:
So, how is this a clue again?

990
00:44:50,731 --> 00:44:54,429
Walter signed his name
in cement in White Falls.

991
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:56,475
Like they do at
Grauman's Chinese theater.

992
00:44:56,476 --> 00:44:58,172
What if it was with D?

993
00:44:58,173 --> 00:45:00,522
In a place special to them?

994
00:45:00,523 --> 00:45:02,873
You're right,
that is a long shot.

995
00:45:02,874 --> 00:45:05,963
He wrote the song
in White Falls.

996
00:45:05,964 --> 00:45:09,444
What if there's
a clue in the lyrics?

997
00:45:09,445 --> 00:45:12,273
Alli, you're doing
some mental gymnastics.

998
00:45:12,274 --> 00:45:13,710
Just hear me out. Hear me out.

999
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:16,495
There's that one line.

1000
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:18,976
"White silent night,

1001
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:20,325
staring at the glowing lights."

1002
00:45:20,326 --> 00:45:24,372
Walter liked to
take walks at night.

1003
00:45:24,373 --> 00:45:27,985
Is there a place where you
can look out to glowing lights?

1004
00:45:27,986 --> 00:45:29,247
The town wasn't
built up back then,

1005
00:45:29,248 --> 00:45:31,858
so the list would be short.

1006
00:45:31,859 --> 00:45:33,555
Have we decided?

1007
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,236
Do you have
the Christmas With You special?

1008
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:38,212
The diner used to
have a special.

1009
00:45:38,213 --> 00:45:40,214
Charbroiled
Christmas with You burgers.

1010
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:41,999
We have burgers.

1011
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,304
We'll take two.

1012
00:45:43,305 --> 00:45:45,524
Thank you.

1013
00:45:45,525 --> 00:45:47,569
She's maybe 20.
Don't take it personally.

1014
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:51,051
Unfortunately that is quick
becoming the norm in town.

1015
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:52,879
Even at Christmas,
its hard to watch.

1016
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,316
Maybe it's a sign
I should take that job in D.C.

1017
00:45:55,317 --> 00:45:58,406
I can't imagine
White Falls without you.

1018
00:45:58,407 --> 00:45:59,756
I can't.

1019
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,628
Well, you haven't
been here that long.

1020
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:04,848
I want White Falls to
remember how special it is

1021
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:08,373
to be invited into millions of
peoples' homes every Christmas.

1022
00:46:08,374 --> 00:46:10,114
We used to
celebrate that honour.

1023
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,681
If I can help bring
back that memory,

1024
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:14,248
at least I can leave happy.

1025
00:46:14,249 --> 00:46:16,033
Enough about me.

1026
00:46:16,034 --> 00:46:17,512
How did you end up
at The Sentinel?

1027
00:46:17,513 --> 00:46:19,732
I took a job in
travel and entertainment

1028
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:21,386
just to get my foot in the door.

1029
00:46:21,387 --> 00:46:24,128
Ever since, I've been trying
to convince my editor

1030
00:46:24,129 --> 00:46:27,522
that I can be a real journalist.

1031
00:46:27,523 --> 00:46:29,046
Report real news.

1032
00:46:29,047 --> 00:46:30,743
This isn't real to you?

1033
00:46:30,744 --> 00:46:33,877
No, I...

1034
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:37,271
Okay, at first,
I thought it was just

1035
00:46:37,272 --> 00:46:39,534
going to be some
Christmas escapism.

1036
00:46:39,535 --> 00:46:43,538
Instead it's a very

1037
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:45,540
real story of love

1038
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:48,805
and maybe heartbreak.

1039
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:51,155
Doesn't get more real than that.

1040
00:46:51,156 --> 00:46:53,331
Hopefully it gets me
on the news team.

1041
00:46:53,332 --> 00:46:58,815
People like you never fail
because they never give up.

1042
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:01,382
I just hope your boss
can see your ambition.

1043
00:47:01,383 --> 00:47:03,124
Yeah. Me, too.

1044
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:08,607
Hey, Dennis.

1045
00:47:08,608 --> 00:47:10,261
Hey kid, I'm checking in on you.

1046
00:47:10,262 --> 00:47:12,698
We're a week away
from Christmas Eve.

1047
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:14,787
Have you found our mystery lady?

1048
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:17,050
Not yet, but I'm working on it.

1049
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:18,182
What happened to your leads?

1050
00:47:18,183 --> 00:47:20,880
They're still leading me.

1051
00:47:20,881 --> 00:47:23,404
Sort of.

1052
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:26,581
Yes or no, will you have
a story ready by Christmas Eve?

1053
00:47:26,582 --> 00:47:29,497
Absolutely.
I won't let you down.

1054
00:47:29,498 --> 00:47:31,282
Please don't.

1055
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,850
I've had marketing
teasing the story all week.

1056
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:34,852
Call me.

1057
00:47:36,766 --> 00:47:39,029
Um, yeah Christmas With You

1058
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:41,727
was filmed all over White Falls.

1059
00:47:41,728 --> 00:47:44,686
So, I'm sure if you
drive in any direction,

1060
00:47:44,687 --> 00:47:46,645
you're going to end up seeing
somewhere where you can see...

1061
00:47:46,646 --> 00:47:49,778
Actually,
this hardware store is where

1062
00:47:49,779 --> 00:47:50,910
Jack bought the candy canes.

1063
00:47:50,911 --> 00:47:52,651
They redressed it for the movie.

1064
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,958
Oh, thanks.

1065
00:47:54,959 --> 00:47:55,960
Bye.

1066
00:47:58,266 --> 00:47:59,745
Sorry, just wanted to help.

1067
00:47:59,746 --> 00:48:03,618
No, thank you. Alli.
I didn't even know that.

1068
00:48:03,619 --> 00:48:05,011
I feel kind of famous now.

1069
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:06,795
How did you know my name?

1070
00:48:06,796 --> 00:48:08,232
Small town.

1071
00:48:08,233 --> 00:48:10,190
You make it your
business to know folks.

1072
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:11,409
That's how we look
out for each other.

1073
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:12,410
Oh.

1074
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:17,067
Hey.

1075
00:48:17,068 --> 00:48:18,416
Hey. Good morning.

1076
00:48:18,417 --> 00:48:20,287
I thought I heard you come in.

1077
00:48:20,288 --> 00:48:23,987
I did some research
and I think I know the spot.

1078
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:26,251
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1079
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:30,645
Oh, wow!

1080
00:48:30,646 --> 00:48:32,910
This is what waking up on
Christmas morning feels like.

1081
00:48:37,392 --> 00:48:39,654
I wish I had
a Christmas tree my room.

1082
00:48:39,655 --> 00:48:42,092
This room always
books up at Christmas.

1083
00:48:42,093 --> 00:48:44,224
I'm honestly surprised
we were able to get in here.

1084
00:48:44,225 --> 00:48:48,489
Well, maybe I should upgrade.

1085
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,102
Walter stayed here during
filming and for the premiere.

1086
00:48:52,103 --> 00:48:55,975
At the time the hotel was
the tallest building in town.

1087
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,456
Wait until you see this view.

1088
00:48:59,762 --> 00:49:00,980
- Alright.
- Wow.

1089
00:49:00,981 --> 00:49:04,462
That is definitely
a romantic view.

1090
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:07,900
I bet at night you could see
all of the glowing lights.

1091
00:49:07,901 --> 00:49:10,903
Apparently the balcony was
the last addition to the suite.

1092
00:49:10,904 --> 00:49:13,079
The manager's grandfather would
tell the story that the cement

1093
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:16,256
wasn't even dry the morning
Walter Andrews checked in.

1094
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:17,779
So, I don't know.
Maybe it's a long shot,

1095
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,956
but do you think he could
have written his name

1096
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,480
down here somewhere?

1097
00:49:27,225 --> 00:49:29,356
Pretty easy place
to woo a lady, huh?

1098
00:49:29,357 --> 00:49:32,751
Men knew how to talk
to ladies back then.

1099
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:35,146
I think the internet
ruined romance.

1100
00:49:36,756 --> 00:49:38,191
Me, I'm old school.

1101
00:49:38,192 --> 00:49:39,627
I believe in looking
in a person's eyes

1102
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:41,935
and knowing instantly
that they are special.

1103
00:49:44,155 --> 00:49:46,286
Like, my grandparents had that.

1104
00:49:46,287 --> 00:49:48,027
My grandfather took
my grandma on one date

1105
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:49,681
before he deployed.

1106
00:49:49,682 --> 00:49:52,466
And she wrote letters
to him every day.

1107
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,338
And actually waited
for him to return.

1108
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:57,080
Wow, I mean,
that feels like a movie.

1109
00:49:57,081 --> 00:49:58,907
Nah. Real life.

1110
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:01,258
Like my grandmother says,

1111
00:50:01,259 --> 00:50:03,348
you can't run from
your soul mate.

1112
00:50:05,654 --> 00:50:07,177
Well, I'm done.

1113
00:50:07,178 --> 00:50:10,571
Gosh. I need a plan B.

1114
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,834
Why don't you come back
with me to the theater?

1115
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:13,922
I'll get you some popcorn.

1116
00:50:13,923 --> 00:50:15,273
Oh, twist my arm.

1117
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:24,585
I wonder if D
came to the premiere.

1118
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:26,544
Do you think she knows
the song was written about her?

1119
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:28,894
It's too bad we can't
just call Walter and ask.

1120
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:30,374
I tried.

1121
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:32,202
He won't speak to
anyone from the press.

1122
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:35,074
I heard he's a bit of a recluse.

1123
00:50:35,075 --> 00:50:37,294
Imagine being the most
famous man in America

1124
00:50:37,295 --> 00:50:38,643
to just making
yourself invisible.

1125
00:50:38,644 --> 00:50:41,950
Hm. All stars
burn out eventually, right?

1126
00:50:41,951 --> 00:50:44,911
Some things last forever.

1127
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:49,654
I love this tree.

1128
00:50:49,655 --> 00:50:51,003
So beautiful.

1129
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:53,005
Reminds me of your grandfather.

1130
00:50:53,006 --> 00:50:56,139
We used to go walking down
Christmas Tree Lane.

1131
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:58,141
What's Christmas Tree Lane?

1132
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:00,012
It was in Christmas With You.

1133
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:02,014
They borrowed it.

1134
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:05,844
For years it was
a tradition in White Falls.

1135
00:51:05,845 --> 00:51:07,889
They would set up
a display of Christmas trees

1136
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,456
in front of the theater.

1137
00:51:09,457 --> 00:51:11,110
The lights were so beautiful.

1138
00:51:11,111 --> 00:51:13,634
At night they just glowed.

1139
00:51:13,635 --> 00:51:14,983
You could smell them
from right on the roof.

1140
00:51:14,984 --> 00:51:17,029
The roof? From the roof?

1141
00:51:17,030 --> 00:51:18,117
Thank you. Love you.

1142
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,293
- Is it?
- Up, up, up. This way.

1143
00:51:20,294 --> 00:51:22,426
Come on, come on.

1144
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:25,255
This has to be it right?
At night you could see

1145
00:51:25,256 --> 00:51:28,171
the glowing lights
on Main Street.

1146
00:51:28,172 --> 00:51:29,695
Brad! Check this out.

1147
00:51:34,787 --> 00:51:36,744
Looks like we have our
second Christmas miracle.

1148
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:39,183
Her name is Daisy.

1149
00:51:43,970 --> 00:51:45,145
Amazing.

1150
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:49,670
Any luck with Daisy?

1151
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,107
I spoke to my friends
at SAG and the Academy,

1152
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,196
and nobody named Daisy
worked on the film.

1153
00:51:53,197 --> 00:51:57,243
It's like every time I take
a step forward I hit a wall.

1154
00:51:57,244 --> 00:52:00,072
We live in
the age of information,

1155
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:01,813
somebody has to know something.

1156
00:52:01,814 --> 00:52:03,336
Let's put the word
out on social media.

1157
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,729
Full court press.

1158
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,557
I'll use my account.
Can you get The Sentinel

1159
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:07,558
to upload on their pages?

1160
00:52:07,559 --> 00:52:09,603
Yeah, I'll call tech right away.

1161
00:52:09,604 --> 00:52:10,865
Are you going to just
wait for a response?

1162
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:13,695
No. I'm gonna hit the pavement.

1163
00:52:16,481 --> 00:52:18,743
It's weird.
I've only been here a week

1164
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:21,093
and it feels like
I know these people.

1165
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:22,442
It's nice.

1166
00:52:22,443 --> 00:52:24,140
I'm liking this new you.

1167
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:27,186
You're turning into the farmer's
daughter of White Falls.

1168
00:52:27,187 --> 00:52:29,362
You're crazy.

1169
00:52:29,363 --> 00:52:30,668
Wish me luck.

1170
00:52:30,669 --> 00:52:32,148
Good luck.

1171
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,715
The Walter Andrews
bought his candy canes

1172
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:36,717
right at this very counter.

1173
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:38,242
Ah. Thanks.

1174
00:52:41,767 --> 00:52:43,420
Hey, Alli.

1175
00:52:43,421 --> 00:52:47,641
Your little Christmas fun fact
has really boosted business.

1176
00:52:47,642 --> 00:52:49,687
I even giving out
candy canes with every purchase.

1177
00:52:49,688 --> 00:52:50,818
For you.

1178
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:53,430
Thank you, Stan.
I'm happy to help.

1179
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:55,780
Hey, you don't happen to know
a Daisy's in town, do you?

1180
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:57,999
She's probably be around
her 70's or 80's.

1181
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,393
Can't say that I do.

1182
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:02,439
You know, I tried to check
the city registrar's office,

1183
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,268
but they're closed because of
holiday hours. So, I'm just...

1184
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,008
My mom works there.

1185
00:53:07,009 --> 00:53:08,314
Let me make a call.
She can help you out.

1186
00:53:08,315 --> 00:53:09,273
- Really?
- Yeah.

1187
00:53:09,274 --> 00:53:10,795
That would be amazing.

1188
00:53:10,796 --> 00:53:12,100
Stan, thank you.

1189
00:53:12,101 --> 00:53:14,234
- Of course.
- Okay.

1190
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:21,109
Stan's Mom:
Okay. Here are the years...

1191
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:23,808
yeah, that you requested.

1192
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:26,898
Oh, thank you.

1193
00:53:26,899 --> 00:53:30,380
Stan told me that you're doing
a story on Christmas With You.

1194
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:33,383
Yeah, the movie,
but more importantly,

1195
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:35,211
the person who
inspired the song.

1196
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:38,605
Oh, lucky girl whoever she was.

1197
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:42,609
Oh, Walter Andrews,
he makes my heart sing.

1198
00:53:42,610 --> 00:53:45,960
Man, I cry every time
I hear that song.

1199
00:53:45,961 --> 00:53:48,311
Just knowing that

1200
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:52,446
Jack has to leave after
finding the love of his life.

1201
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:56,057
Good thing he comes
back in the end.

1202
00:53:56,058 --> 00:53:58,059
He does.

1203
00:53:58,060 --> 00:54:02,455
And, you know, when he calls
out to Betsy from the rooftop.

1204
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:05,590
Oh, that's when
you know it is love.

1205
00:54:07,505 --> 00:54:09,854
That's what Christmas
is all about.

1206
00:54:09,855 --> 00:54:12,117
Okay, uh...

1207
00:54:12,118 --> 00:54:14,641
Good luck and let me know
if there's anything you need.

1208
00:54:14,642 --> 00:54:16,122
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1209
00:54:37,056 --> 00:54:38,491
Elaine?

1210
00:54:38,492 --> 00:54:40,014
- Elaine!
- Yup?

1211
00:54:40,015 --> 00:54:42,321
I found a transfer of deed
from Walter Andrews

1212
00:54:42,322 --> 00:54:44,062
to Margaret Osborne.

1213
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:47,979
Oh, yeah, well,
Margaret Westdale now.

1214
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,374
I thought that the city gifted
the Westdales' the theatre

1215
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:53,593
after the premiere,

1216
00:54:53,594 --> 00:54:56,553
but this date is November 1955.

1217
00:54:56,554 --> 00:54:58,643
The movie didn't
come out until December.

1218
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,646
No. The city never
owned the theater.

1219
00:55:02,647 --> 00:55:04,169
It was always under
private ownership.

1220
00:55:04,170 --> 00:55:06,171
Here, um...

1221
00:55:06,172 --> 00:55:08,216
Let me show you.

1222
00:55:08,217 --> 00:55:10,697
Here are

1223
00:55:10,698 --> 00:55:14,266
pictures from the opening,

1224
00:55:14,267 --> 00:55:16,703
when they changed
the name to the Westdale.

1225
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,053
See?

1226
00:55:19,054 --> 00:55:20,881
Martin and Daisy Westdale

1227
00:55:20,882 --> 00:55:22,754
proudly open their new cinema.

1228
00:55:24,408 --> 00:55:26,800
Daisy?

1229
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:28,759
No. That doesn't make sense.

1230
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,764
Oh, well, Marguerite in
French also means daisy.

1231
00:55:35,114 --> 00:55:38,029
It's probably how
she got the nickname.

1232
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:41,816
I'm sure she used that
when she was growing up.

1233
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:49,170
Hey, Jen. I found Daisy.
It's urgent you call me back.

1234
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:50,563
Is Brad here?

1235
00:55:50,564 --> 00:55:51,956
No, ma'am.
He should be here soon, though.

1236
00:55:51,957 --> 00:55:56,788
Just feel free to enjoy
the movie while you wait.

1237
00:56:00,226 --> 00:56:02,706
Did you say
that was on the 28th?

1238
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:04,403
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1239
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:05,883
That's the night
our favourite charity's

1240
00:56:05,884 --> 00:56:07,537
having their little fundraiser.

1241
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:10,191
Oh, what charity is that?

1242
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:12,237
The MTBTDS.

1243
00:56:12,238 --> 00:56:14,805
MTBTDS?

1244
00:56:14,806 --> 00:56:16,372
Money To Bury The Dead Sea.

1245
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:20,332
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
You have my card.

1246
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,725
Yeah, you want it back?

1247
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:24,423
No, I have plenty.
Thank you.

1248
00:56:24,424 --> 00:56:25,599
I wonder who blew him up.

1249
00:56:29,037 --> 00:56:30,386
Hey, uh, Freddy.

1250
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,823
Don't look now, but, uh,

1251
00:56:32,824 --> 00:56:35,303
my charm has been recognized.

1252
00:56:35,304 --> 00:56:37,610
Oh, I'll be very coy about it.

1253
00:56:37,611 --> 00:56:39,657
Nonchalant vibes.

1254
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,703
Boy, she's a beauty, ain't she?

1255
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:45,183
Oh, boy.

1256
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:47,228
Freddy: You see that
ring around her finger?

1257
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:48,839
She's got enough karats
there to feed 2000 rabbits.

1258
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,927
Hey.

1259
00:56:49,928 --> 00:56:50,971
You found her?

1260
00:56:50,972 --> 00:56:52,016
Yep.

1261
00:56:52,017 --> 00:56:54,671
Why aren't you more excited?

1262
00:56:54,672 --> 00:56:56,194
Daisy is Brad's grandmother.

1263
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:57,849
The city didn't
gift her the theater.

1264
00:56:59,503 --> 00:57:01,939
Walter Andrews did.

1265
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,549
I thought her name was Margaret?

1266
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:04,985
Daisy is a nickname.

1267
00:57:04,986 --> 00:57:06,900
It's French.

1268
00:57:06,901 --> 00:57:08,424
Brad clearly knows
nothing about this.

1269
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,121
I mean, he thinks his
grandparents were soul mates,

1270
00:57:10,122 --> 00:57:12,689
and for good reason,
they had a magical love story.

1271
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,821
I mean,
to think that Walter Andrews,

1272
00:57:14,822 --> 00:57:16,388
notorious playboy,

1273
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:19,260
was willing to give up
Hollywood for her. That's crazy.

1274
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:20,958
I know!

1275
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:23,264
I showed Margaret the note
and she didn't say a word.

1276
00:57:23,265 --> 00:57:25,919
Obviously, she doesn't want her
family to know about the affair.

1277
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:27,704
Are you sure it was an affair?

1278
00:57:27,705 --> 00:57:30,881
I mean, she ended up
with Brad's grandfather.

1279
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,492
The man gifted her a theater
and she accepted it.

1280
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:34,928
That's not a friendly gesture.

1281
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:37,670
Their names are
in cement on the roof.

1282
00:57:37,671 --> 00:57:40,064
Wow, Daisy the little minx.

1283
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:43,415
It's an incredible story,
isn't it?

1284
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:45,156
The internet would go wild.

1285
00:57:45,157 --> 00:57:47,463
Dennis will give me that spot
on the news team for sure.

1286
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:50,335
Then write it. You earned this.

1287
00:57:50,336 --> 00:57:53,947
But what about Brad?

1288
00:57:53,948 --> 00:57:56,123
This will destroy his family,

1289
00:57:56,124 --> 00:57:59,518
his faith, the theater.

1290
00:57:59,519 --> 00:58:01,085
Wow, so he's really
special to you.

1291
00:58:01,086 --> 00:58:05,002
He is,
but it's an incredible story,

1292
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:07,570
and I just can't
believe I cracked it.

1293
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,528
I mean, the woman inspired
one of the most famous

1294
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,138
Christmas songs of all time.

1295
00:58:11,139 --> 00:58:14,141
She must want
the world to know, right?

1296
00:58:14,142 --> 00:58:15,708
Of course she would.

1297
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,710
You'll make her famous.
Good work, kid.

1298
00:58:17,711 --> 00:58:18,798
Can't wait to read the story.

1299
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,670
This is a private call.

1300
00:58:20,671 --> 00:58:23,281
If you want privacy,
don't use the conference room.

1301
00:58:23,282 --> 00:58:25,065
Alli, your instincts were right.

1302
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:27,067
Everyone loves
a Hollywood romance.

1303
00:58:27,068 --> 00:58:30,375
It's like the real time version
of Christmas with You.

1304
00:58:30,376 --> 00:58:33,639
Big time star
falls for small town girl.

1305
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,207
Except they didn't
end up together in the end.

1306
00:58:36,208 --> 00:58:38,252
Doesn't matter. We got one
of the greatest love songs

1307
00:58:38,253 --> 00:58:40,124
of all time out of it.

1308
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:42,953
We publish Christmas Eve.
Good work, kid.

1309
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:46,434
You just earned
your spot on the news team.

1310
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:49,612
Hey! Congratulations!
You just made the news division.

1311
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:50,917
Yeah, at what cost?

1312
00:58:50,918 --> 00:58:52,353
I like this new Alli.

1313
00:58:52,354 --> 00:58:54,617
One that puts
feelings over facts.

1314
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:58,838
The fact is I'm feeling pretty
awful no matter what I do.

1315
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:00,623
You're not breaking
up a marriage.

1316
00:59:00,624 --> 00:59:02,060
No...

1317
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:06,064
But I may break a heart.

1318
00:59:10,111 --> 00:59:11,503
How did I not know that?

1319
00:59:11,504 --> 00:59:14,375
It was a childhood nickname
from 65 years ago.

1320
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:15,812
How could you have known?

1321
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,291
She kept it a secret
for a reason, Alli.

1322
00:59:17,292 --> 00:59:19,206
If you publish it's just
going to be a scandal.

1323
00:59:19,207 --> 00:59:22,688
Brad, your grandmother
chose your grandfather

1324
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:26,300
over the biggest
star in the world.

1325
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:28,085
That's true love.

1326
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:30,566
It's bigger than the movies.
That's the story.

1327
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:33,177
If the whole world reads about
my grandmother's private life,

1328
00:59:33,178 --> 00:59:36,093
as if it's entertainment,
on Christmas,

1329
00:59:36,094 --> 00:59:38,661
it'll devastate her
and my family.

1330
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:42,013
You're right. You're right.

1331
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,058
I won't publish this story.

1332
00:59:45,059 --> 00:59:48,322
I'll do the movie justice
without the scandal.

1333
00:59:48,323 --> 00:59:49,672
I'll find a way.

1334
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:52,109
I hope so.

1335
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:53,110
Hey.

1336
00:59:54,634 --> 00:59:55,766
There's always a way.

1337
01:00:06,646 --> 01:00:10,954

Thanks for meeting me.

1349
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:09,534
It is such a relief to see you
in a good mood.

1350
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:11,797
I could barely sleep last night.

1351
01:01:11,798 --> 01:01:14,626
I was worried I had ruined
Christmas for you.

1352
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:17,585
My grandmother left it in the
past, I should too.

1353
01:01:17,586 --> 01:01:19,849
If "Christmas With You" is still
her favourite movie,

1354
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:22,460
there's no reason why I can't
still love it too.

1355
01:01:22,461 --> 01:01:24,810
- Can I see?
- Sure.

1356
01:01:24,811 --> 01:01:26,725
I had the printer do
another run.

1357
01:01:26,726 --> 01:01:28,553
I want to make sure we have
a full house.

1358
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,033
Oh, and I got the red carpet.

1359
01:01:30,034 --> 01:01:31,512
And we're going to be
playing the music

1360
01:01:31,513 --> 01:01:32,688
over the outdoor speakers.

1361
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,733
I think you may restore

1362
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:36,604
White Falls' Christmas spirit
after all.

1363
01:01:36,605 --> 01:01:40,000
Not just me.
We make a good team.

1364
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,003
Whoa!

1365
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:47,398
Merry Christmas.
We are officially sold out.

1366
01:01:47,399 --> 01:01:50,793
Wow! I can't believe it!
Tracy, this looks incredible.

1367
01:01:50,794 --> 01:01:52,055
Thank you.

1368
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:54,100
And thank you for trusting me
with it.

1369
01:01:54,101 --> 01:01:56,015
I know it wasn't easy.

1370
01:01:56,016 --> 01:01:57,364
You haven't even seen
the best part!

1371
01:01:57,365 --> 01:02:00,411
Wait, wait, isn't that from the
memorabilia room.

1372
01:02:00,412 --> 01:02:02,936
Maybe. Cue the music!

1373
01:02:11,858 --> 01:02:14,120
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

1374
01:02:14,121 --> 01:02:15,992
Oh, these are my poinsettias.

1375
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:19,126
Ah, those are mine, thank you!
Fellas!

1376
01:02:20,954 --> 01:02:23,129
After listening to that song
for so many years,

1377
01:02:23,130 --> 01:02:25,741
just knowing now that it was
inspired by my grandma

1378
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,264
is surreal.

1379
01:02:27,265 --> 01:02:28,874
No matter how or why it was
written,

1380
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:31,007
it's brought joy to millions
of people.

1381
01:02:31,008 --> 01:02:32,879
And that's special.

1382
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:36,316
What about you? The news team?

1383
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:40,016
You'll still make it without
revealing Daisy, right?

1384
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:41,931
Yeah... yeah.

1385
01:02:41,932 --> 01:02:43,802
"Christmas With You"
is the story.

1386
01:02:43,803 --> 01:02:46,631
It's a classic Christmas
tradition.

1387
01:02:46,632 --> 01:02:48,589
My editor will see that.

1388
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:52,158
You know, he, uh... he has to.

1389
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:54,508
I really appreciate you
making a sacrifice

1390
01:02:54,509 --> 01:02:56,467
on behalf of my family.

1391
01:02:56,468 --> 01:02:57,948
Thank you.

1392
01:03:03,605 --> 01:03:05,476
You going somewhere?

1393
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:07,783
I promised Mrs. Caldwell

1394
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,132
I'd help her put away some
inventory.

1395
01:03:09,133 --> 01:03:12,657
But, uh, dinner later tonight?

1396
01:03:12,658 --> 01:03:15,399
Sounds good.

1397
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:17,662
It's a date.

1398
01:03:17,663 --> 01:03:19,839
A real one this time.

1399
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:37,464
- Hey, Dennis.
- Alli.

1400
01:03:37,465 --> 01:03:39,249
We're two days from
Christmas Eve.

1401
01:03:39,250 --> 01:03:41,729
What's the ETA on your story?

1402
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:42,948
It's coming.

1403
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:45,559
You're not pivoting, are you?

1404
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,996
Well...

1405
01:03:46,997 --> 01:03:48,693
We've been promoting
your story all week.

1406
01:03:48,694 --> 01:03:52,131
People want to know the mystery
woman behind the song.

1407
01:03:52,132 --> 01:03:54,133
I have plenty of material

1408
01:03:54,134 --> 01:03:56,396
to give you a heartwarming,
Christmassy article

1409
01:03:56,397 --> 01:04:00,139
about the song, about the movie,
about the town.

1410
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:03,795
But the woman will remain
a mystery.

1411
01:04:03,796 --> 01:04:05,492
Huh, you're kidding, right?

1412
01:04:05,493 --> 01:04:07,843
But Dennis,
see, it's the mystery

1413
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,409
that keeps the magic alive.

1414
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:12,760
See, no one wants to go behind
the curtain and see Oz.

1415
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:14,980
You give me a whale of a story
and you expect me

1416
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:17,548
not to publish?
I hate to do this,

1417
01:04:17,549 --> 01:04:19,767
but if you can't deliver,
I'll find a writer who will.

1418
01:04:19,768 --> 01:04:21,508
No, you wouldn't. You can't.

1419
01:04:21,509 --> 01:04:24,468
Our entire readership has been
waiting on this story.

1420
01:04:24,469 --> 01:04:28,037
Even my wife is counting down
the days to find out.

1421
01:04:28,038 --> 01:04:30,343
It's complicated.

1422
01:04:30,344 --> 01:04:33,825
- There are feelings involved.
- How?

1423
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:35,653
It's an affair
from 65 years ago!

1424
01:04:35,654 --> 01:04:38,003
Her husband is deceased!

1425
01:04:38,004 --> 01:04:42,051
Besides, it's facts,
not feelings, that matter.

1426
01:04:42,052 --> 01:04:44,314
That's your philosophy,
is it not?

1427
01:04:44,315 --> 01:04:48,013
If I don't have your story
in 24 hours,

1428
01:04:48,014 --> 01:04:49,885
I'm giving it to another writer.

1429
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,103
I'll figure it out.

1430
01:04:51,104 --> 01:04:52,758
I'm counting on you, kid.

1431
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:11,471
Hi, Margaret.

1432
01:05:11,472 --> 01:05:13,256
Oh, hello, dear.

1433
01:05:13,257 --> 01:05:15,085
Everything okay?

1434
01:05:16,303 --> 01:05:18,000
I...

1435
01:05:18,001 --> 01:05:20,525
I know about you and Walter
Andrews.

1436
01:05:22,353 --> 01:05:23,484
Oh.

1437
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:33,102
After all these years,

1438
01:05:33,103 --> 01:05:35,626
maybe the world should know
the truth about

1439
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:38,108
Walter Andrews' kind heart.

1440
01:05:40,719 --> 01:05:42,589
Is it okay if I record this?

1441
01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:44,941
Of course. Of course, dear.

1442
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,293
It all started here.

1443
01:05:50,598 --> 01:05:52,599
I was 19, taking tickets.

1444
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,082
And one day this handsome man
walked up.

1445
01:05:57,083 --> 01:05:58,823
Honestly, I had no idea
who he was.

1446
01:05:58,824 --> 01:06:01,652
Really? Walter Andrews?

1447
01:06:01,653 --> 01:06:04,350
Well, you don't expect to see a

1448
01:06:04,351 --> 01:06:06,918
big movie star in a small town.

1449
01:06:06,919 --> 01:06:09,138
It's probably why he liked me.

1450
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:12,793
Pretty soon we were talking for
hours about books

1451
01:06:12,794 --> 01:06:15,840
and life and everything.

1452
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:19,801
Suffice it to say, um, he missed
his movie that day.

1453
01:06:21,542 --> 01:06:22,847
And were you engaged
at the time?

1454
01:06:22,848 --> 01:06:25,545
Oh, heavens no.

1455
01:06:25,546 --> 01:06:27,634
No, Martin and I
had only gone on one date

1456
01:06:27,635 --> 01:06:29,897
before he was deployed.

1457
01:06:29,898 --> 01:06:33,249
But we wrote each other
every day.

1458
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:36,992
I told Walter about Martin the
first night we met.

1459
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:38,863
And Martin knew about Walter.

1460
01:06:38,864 --> 01:06:42,780
Neither one asked me to choose.

1461
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:46,044
It's hard to stake a claim
on a girl like me.

1462
01:06:46,045 --> 01:06:47,785
I've always been my own woman.

1463
01:06:47,786 --> 01:06:50,657
I know the feeling.

1464
01:06:50,658 --> 01:06:53,225
During Walter's stay,

1465
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:56,359
we saw each other every day.

1466
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:01,059
We'd exchange books or sit up
on the roof and talk.

1467
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:03,366
Oh, he loved it up there.

1468
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:05,585
Especially at night.

1469
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:07,761
Hmm.

1470
01:07:07,762 --> 01:07:09,590
Oh, we connected.

1471
01:07:12,419 --> 01:07:16,293
It's so nice having someone
so easy to talk to.

1472
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:20,383
Did you love him, Margaret?

1473
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:22,994
Oh, what does a girl of 19
know about love?

1474
01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:24,430
A lot...

1475
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:26,215
I suspect.

1476
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:30,523
Well, let's just say I enjoyed
Walter's company.

1477
01:07:30,524 --> 01:07:32,438
Until one day when we were
out walking,

1478
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:34,397
this photographer took
our picture.

1479
01:07:34,398 --> 01:07:36,790
Next thing I knew,
Louella Parsons and Hedda Hopper

1480
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:40,794
were discussing Walter's flavour
of the month.

1481
01:07:40,795 --> 01:07:44,189
It was al very invasive.

1482
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:46,844
Strangers speculating on
our lives.

1483
01:07:46,845 --> 01:07:48,368
I can imagine.

1484
01:07:51,893 --> 01:07:53,807
And what about the song?

1485
01:07:53,808 --> 01:07:57,942
Oh, yes.

1486
01:07:57,943 --> 01:07:59,770
Walter wrote that song.

1487
01:07:59,771 --> 01:08:03,253
And he said he'd give up
everything for me.

1488
01:08:05,211 --> 01:08:08,126
But I couldn't let him do that.

1489
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:11,086
Walter loved to perform and the
world loved him.

1490
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:13,131
I was just a small town girl.

1491
01:08:13,132 --> 01:08:17,180
I mean, who was I to end
that love affair?

1492
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:22,533
You never answered my question.

1493
01:08:25,057 --> 01:08:26,972
Did you love him?

1494
01:08:30,932 --> 01:08:32,630
I did.

1495
01:08:34,806 --> 01:08:36,286
Yes.

1496
01:08:38,462 --> 01:08:42,639
And in a different lifetime,
we ruled the world.

1497
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:45,381
But not in this one.

1498
01:08:45,382 --> 01:08:47,861
The song says it all,
doesn't it?

1499
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:49,299
"All In Time."

1500
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:51,997
Just wasn't ours.

1501
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:55,608
My heart was Martin's.

1502
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:59,090
And when he returned on
Christmas Eve,

1503
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:00,918
I knew where I belonged.

1504
01:09:00,919 --> 01:09:02,616
And so did Walter.

1505
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:08,882
So what about the theatre?

1506
01:09:08,883 --> 01:09:12,538
Oh, that was Walter's Christmas
gift to me.

1507
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:14,627
His only request was never
to tell anyone.

1508
01:09:14,628 --> 01:09:16,803
Well, except for Martin,
of course.

1509
01:09:16,804 --> 01:09:20,851
He called it his monument
to his love for me.

1510
01:09:20,852 --> 01:09:23,984
Oh...

1511
01:09:23,985 --> 01:09:27,249
Through movie magic,
we could always be together.

1512
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:31,427
He said, "Think of me"

1513
01:09:31,428 --> 01:09:34,604
"every time you look up
at the screen,

1514
01:09:34,605 --> 01:09:38,129
"and every time you hear
our song."

1515
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:40,785
"And I'll be thinking of you."

1516
01:09:47,052 --> 01:09:49,185
- May I?
- Of course, dear.

1517
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:55,668
After the movie left town,

1518
01:09:55,669 --> 01:09:57,975
I went by the name of Margaret,
my given name.

1519
01:09:57,976 --> 01:10:00,456
I left Daisy in the past.

1520
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:04,155
In my heart,
she stayed with Walter.

1521
01:10:04,156 --> 01:10:07,550
So no regrets?

1522
01:10:07,551 --> 01:10:10,379
Not one.

1523
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:15,254
The heart can hold an infinite
amount of love.

1524
01:10:17,952 --> 01:10:21,390
This is an incredible story.

1525
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:23,348
You loved them both.

1526
01:10:23,349 --> 01:10:26,699
Oh, with all my heart.

1527
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,181
Most people are lucky if they
ever find their soulmate.

1528
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:31,705
I found two.

1529
01:10:33,620 --> 01:10:36,101
Write it like
you lived it, dear.

1530
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:38,408
I will.

1531
01:10:40,018 --> 01:10:41,280
Good.

1532
01:10:42,934 --> 01:10:44,935
Thank you.

1533
01:10:44,936 --> 01:10:46,677
Thank you!

1534
01:10:54,772 --> 01:10:56,294
- Oh!
- Oh my God, are you...

1535
01:10:56,295 --> 01:10:58,383
I'm so sorry.

1536
01:10:58,384 --> 01:11:00,342
- What is this?
- Brad.

1537
01:11:00,343 --> 01:11:03,127
I can explain.

1538
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:05,085
Still after the facts?

1539
01:11:05,086 --> 01:11:06,739
No matter whose feelings
you hurt.

1540
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:08,175
No, Brad, it isn't what you
think it is.

1541
01:11:08,176 --> 01:11:10,221
I trusted you.

1542
01:11:10,222 --> 01:11:11,483
You promised!

1543
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:14,007
Listen, the story was too big!

1544
01:11:14,008 --> 01:11:15,444
It was my editor!

1545
01:11:15,445 --> 01:11:17,663
I couldn't let another writer
break this story.

1546
01:11:17,664 --> 01:11:19,796
They don't know you like I do.

1547
01:11:19,797 --> 01:11:21,580
I guess you were right.

1548
01:11:21,581 --> 01:11:23,408
Happy endings only happen
in the movies.

1549
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:25,628
Congratulations on making the
news division.

1550
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:28,327
I hope it was worth destroying
a small town for.

1551
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:40,425
- Tracy?
- Hey, can I come in?

1552
01:11:40,426 --> 01:11:43,210
- It's Brad.
- Is he okay?

1553
01:11:43,211 --> 01:11:45,517
Look, I know he thinks I'm a
terrible person, but...

1554
01:11:45,518 --> 01:11:47,345
Your grandmother gave me
permission,

1555
01:11:47,346 --> 01:11:49,391
and to be honest,
she encouraged it.

1556
01:11:49,392 --> 01:11:52,176
I know, I know.
She told me all about it.

1557
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:55,397
My grandmother and the world's
biggest movie star.

1558
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:58,008
I'm not gonna lie,
I'm very impressed.

1559
01:11:58,009 --> 01:12:00,316
And Brad?

1560
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,843
He's taking the job in DC
after Christmas.

1561
01:12:06,844 --> 01:12:08,497
I mean, he always said that the
movies could take you...

1562
01:12:08,498 --> 01:12:10,194
Take you anywhere.

1563
01:12:10,195 --> 01:12:12,631
Yeah.

1564
01:12:12,632 --> 01:12:16,418
But I didn't think that they'd
take him from White Falls.

1565
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:18,681
I've watched him these past
couple of weeks.

1566
01:12:18,682 --> 01:12:20,378
He belongs here.

1567
01:12:20,379 --> 01:12:23,425
His heart is in that theatre.

1568
01:12:23,426 --> 01:12:25,863
His heart is with you.

1569
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:39,529
The heart holds an infinite
amount of love.

1570
01:12:43,576 --> 01:12:46,535
I am going to fix this, Tracy.

1571
01:12:46,536 --> 01:12:48,319
But I'm going to need your help.

1572
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:50,843
- Yes, I'm in!
- Okay.

1573
01:12:50,844 --> 01:12:51,976
Um...

1574
01:12:58,504 --> 01:13:02,202
Hey, Jen? I need some help with
Walter Andrews.

1575
01:13:02,203 --> 01:13:06,555
Yeah, could you get me a listing
of every hotel in the Hamptons?

1576
01:13:06,556 --> 01:13:10,297
You're the best.

1577
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:12,735
Okay. Um...

1578
01:13:12,736 --> 01:13:16,260
Oh! Do you have a dress
I could borrow?

1579
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:18,175
Tracy: I was hoping
you'd say that.

1580
01:13:18,176 --> 01:13:20,787
I have "the" dress.

1581
01:13:38,718 --> 01:13:41,328
Grandma, you look stunning.

1582
01:13:41,329 --> 01:13:42,939
And so do you!

1583
01:13:42,940 --> 01:13:46,508
I don't know if I pull it off,
but thank you.

1584
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:48,727
Oh, I haven't dressed up like
this in years.

1585
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:50,903
I'd forgotten how good it feels.

1586
01:13:50,904 --> 01:13:54,167
Oh, this movie and the song have
brought me so much joy

1587
01:13:54,168 --> 01:13:55,517
through the years.

1588
01:13:55,518 --> 01:13:58,084
The Christmas gift that
keeps on giving.

1589
01:13:58,085 --> 01:14:01,523
Thank you for this screening.
It means the world.

1590
01:14:01,524 --> 01:14:03,481
You are more than welcome.

1591
01:14:03,482 --> 01:14:06,441
You're so handsome.

1592
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,313
Except for one thing.

1593
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:17,103
I... I can't.
This is from the movie!

1594
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:19,410
Oh, yes you can!

1595
01:14:19,411 --> 01:14:22,022
Every leading man needs
a good hat.

1596
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:27,026
Wow.

1597
01:14:27,027 --> 01:14:29,159
Perfect.

1598
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,813
Oh, I love you so much, darling.

1599
01:14:30,814 --> 01:14:33,555
I love you too.

1600
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:35,470
But now we have a hole
in our display.

1601
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:37,734
Oh, no, no. Not necessarily.

1602
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,872
Grandma, are you sure you
want this out there?

1603
01:14:46,873 --> 01:14:51,616
It represents the best
Christmas of my life.

1604
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:54,619
Your grandfather returned
home to me.

1605
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,143
And the biggest movie star
in the world

1606
01:14:57,144 --> 01:14:59,582
made me feel like a
leading lady.

1607
01:15:01,279 --> 01:15:03,759
It's time to share that love.

1608
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:07,110
Uh, Brad, we have an emergency!
The Christmas candies,

1609
01:15:07,111 --> 01:15:09,852
I left them too close to the
popper and they melted,

1610
01:15:09,853 --> 01:15:12,115
and now we don't have any for
Santa's popcorn.

1611
01:15:12,116 --> 01:15:14,770
Okay. Uh, Mrs. Caldwell may have
something we can use.

1612
01:15:14,771 --> 01:15:16,336
Can you run over there?

1613
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:17,686
I called. She's closed already.

1614
01:15:17,687 --> 01:15:19,122
She's getting ready for the
screening.

1615
01:15:19,123 --> 01:15:21,298
The diner. Joyce. She uses them
in the pancakes. Go there.

1616
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:24,997
Uh, what if I don't get enough,
or what if I get the wrong kind?

1617
01:15:24,998 --> 01:15:28,087
Okay, okay. You drive,
I'll hop out.

1618
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:30,873
- See you soon.
- Okay. Thank you.

1619
01:15:30,874 --> 01:15:33,353
- Nice hat!
- Heh, thanks!

1620
01:15:41,145 --> 01:15:42,841
I'll run in real fast.

1621
01:15:42,842 --> 01:15:44,321
- Be right back, okay?
- Go.

1622
01:15:44,322 --> 01:15:47,411
All right.

1623
01:15:47,412 --> 01:15:49,152
- Thanks a million.
- Yes.

1624
01:15:49,153 --> 01:15:51,024
You're a lifesaver.

1625
01:16:04,255 --> 01:16:05,560
Nice hat!

1626
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:08,084
Thanks, it's my grandma's idea.

1627
01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:09,607
It suits you.

1628
01:16:09,608 --> 01:16:11,174
And now you have all my
Christmas candy.

1629
01:16:11,175 --> 01:16:13,917
- Put it to good use.
- Thank you. Appreciate it!

1630
01:16:15,483 --> 01:16:17,484
- All right.
- Hey, give it to me!

1631
01:16:17,485 --> 01:16:18,964
- Score.
- Awesome!

1632
01:16:18,965 --> 01:16:21,488
Okay, I sent you Alli's article.
Read it.

1633
01:16:21,489 --> 01:16:23,055
- Tracy!
- Read it!

1634
01:16:23,056 --> 01:16:24,666
And don't come back to the
theatre until you have.

1635
01:16:24,667 --> 01:16:26,276
What are you doing? Come on!

1636
01:16:26,277 --> 01:16:28,584
- Are you serious? Come on!
- You'll thank me!

1637
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:32,196
Oh, come on!

1638
01:16:45,949 --> 01:16:47,124
Okay.

1639
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:52,737
I've got this. I can do this.

1640
01:16:52,738 --> 01:16:56,654
Spirit of Christmas,
give me a sign.

1641
01:16:56,655 --> 01:16:59,570
Maybe I am a sign.

1642
01:16:59,571 --> 01:17:00,790
Okay.

1643
01:17:03,923 --> 01:17:05,142
Brad!

1644
01:17:06,447 --> 01:17:07,579
Brad!

1645
01:17:09,015 --> 01:17:11,016
If you'd have told me
two weeks ago

1646
01:17:11,017 --> 01:17:12,757
that I'd be shouting from
the rooftops,

1647
01:17:12,758 --> 01:17:15,107
I would have laughed.

1648
01:17:15,108 --> 01:17:18,633
That kind of thing only happens
in the movies, right?

1649
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,895
Well, here I am.

1650
01:17:19,896 --> 01:17:23,246
You changed me, Brad.

1651
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:25,901
You changed White Falls.

1652
01:17:25,902 --> 01:17:30,296
You made us all believers
that magic is real.

1653
01:17:30,297 --> 01:17:33,038
And you were right!

1654
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:36,868
A movie can take you anywhere.

1655
01:17:36,869 --> 01:17:40,829
It took me to you.

1656
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:43,614
And I don't want to spend a
lifetime wondering

1657
01:17:43,615 --> 01:17:45,486
what could have been.

1658
01:17:57,063 --> 01:17:58,935
Wolt looks just like
in the movie!

1659
01:18:06,638 --> 01:18:08,422
Man: It's Walter Andrews!

1660
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:25,308
Daisy!

1661
01:18:25,309 --> 01:18:28,007
We finally meet outside
my dreams.

1662
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:37,146
Oh, Walter!
It's so good to see you again!

1663
01:18:37,147 --> 01:18:39,104
Mr. Andrews!

1664
01:18:53,206 --> 01:18:55,860
- I... I've got to...
- Oh, yeah!

1665
01:18:55,861 --> 01:18:58,081
Go, go! I'm good.

1666
01:19:03,913 --> 01:19:05,740
Is that a pig?

1667
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:07,438
Well, if it's a dog,
then I need glasses.

1668
01:19:10,528 --> 01:19:11,963
Avery Falls.

1669
01:19:11,964 --> 01:19:14,358
- Avery Falls?
- Last time I checked.

1670
01:19:19,189 --> 01:19:20,580
- Jack!
- Betsy!

1671
01:19:20,581 --> 01:19:23,975
I was wrong about us.
I was wrong about you.

1672
01:19:23,976 --> 01:19:26,282
- And so were you.
- Hey.

1673
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:28,632
You're not empty-souled
Christmas ham peddler.

1674
01:19:28,633 --> 01:19:30,155
I was looking for you.

1675
01:19:30,156 --> 01:19:32,114
I thought you were inside
watching the movie.

1676
01:19:32,115 --> 01:19:35,465
I took a walk. A lot on my mind.

1677
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:39,295
Well, you'll be relieved to know
the last reel is on

1678
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:40,426
without a hitch.

1679
01:19:40,427 --> 01:19:42,689
Ah, yes.

1680
01:19:42,690 --> 01:19:45,258
The dance between man
and machine.

1681
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:51,394
Brad, I know that you think I
betrayed your trust,

1682
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:54,353
and I am so sorry, but...

1683
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:58,575
I had to follow my feelings and
do what was right.

1684
01:19:58,576 --> 01:20:01,012
I'm not mad, Alli.

1685
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:05,103
I'm touched, honestly.

1686
01:20:05,104 --> 01:20:08,193
Did you really mean everything
that you said up there?

1687
01:20:08,194 --> 01:20:10,630
Every word.

1688
01:20:10,631 --> 01:20:14,112
You made me realize that there
are great stories,

1689
01:20:14,113 --> 01:20:16,941
that make a difference,
that change people's lives.

1690
01:20:16,942 --> 01:20:20,816
And if we're lucky,
even our own.

1691
01:20:24,645 --> 01:20:29,519
You know they other day when we
dropped the candy canes?

1692
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,870
I got my wish.

1693
01:20:33,567 --> 01:20:36,221
And what was that?

1694
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:38,834
To spend Christmas with you.

1695
01:20:45,405 --> 01:20:48,233
Does this mean that you're
staying?

1696
01:20:48,234 --> 01:20:51,889
You've made my heart sing, Alli.
How could I leave?

1697
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:54,152
You know, I can write from
anywhere.

1698
01:20:54,153 --> 01:20:56,285
- Oh, you can, can you?
- I can.

1699
01:20:56,286 --> 01:21:00,855
I guess sometimes life is like
the movies, huh?

1700
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:03,683
This time it's better.

1701
01:21:03,684 --> 01:21:07,078
How in the world did you get
Walter Andrews here?

1702
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:11,213
I name-dropped Daisy Osborne.

1703
01:21:11,214 --> 01:21:15,130
He told me that she's the love
of his life.

1704
01:21:15,131 --> 01:21:16,958
Wow.

1705
01:21:16,959 --> 01:21:19,874
It's funny how a dose of reality

1706
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:21,075
restored my faith in Christmas.

1707
01:21:22,921 --> 01:21:24,401
Thank you.

1708
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:28,535
Well, that's a Christmas
miracle.

1709
01:21:30,798 --> 01:21:32,495
We had it all along...

1710
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:34,976
You're my Christmas star,

1711
01:21:34,977 --> 01:21:37,108
shining a light on love.

1712
01:21:37,109 --> 01:21:40,198
How could I ever let a gal
like you go?

1713
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:44,159
