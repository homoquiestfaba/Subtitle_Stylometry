1
00:00:00,127 --> 00:00:03,210
(film reel clicking)

2
00:00:07,245 --> 00:00:09,828
(solemn music)

3
00:00:22,717 --> 00:00:25,384
(shovels thump)

4
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:34,183
(solemn instrumental music)

5
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:40,070
- [Teddy] Deep in the
Appalachian Mountains,

6
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:42,913
people here, they play by their own rules.

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,770
There are secrets that
never leave these hills.

8
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,930
Summer of 1929 was the year I turned 13,

9
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:55,330
a summer of loss, fear, and
the beginning of a new chapter.

10
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,620
I lost my father in a railroad accident,

11
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,763
and I became the man of the
house while still a child.

12
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:03,520
- [Both] Ready, set!

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,519
- [Teddy] My best friend, Willy Stamper,

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,610
lived up on Adam's Ridge.
(water splashes)

15
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,840
His daddy hated mine, never knew why.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,890
They had a feud between them
since me and Willy was born.

17
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,257
Do you, William John Stamper

18
00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:19,050
accept the Lord Jesus
Christ as your savior?

19
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,770
- Oh yes, Lord.

20
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,770
Please, forgive me.

21
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,450
- And do your repent for all your sins?

22
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:28,360
- Yes, Lord, please forgive me.

23
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,130
- [Teddy] But Mama, she
always let Willy come over.

24
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:34,301
We were as tight as shoe leather

25
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:37,259
until one day that
would change everything.

26
00:01:42,048 --> 00:01:44,965
(melancholy music)

27
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:54,906
(majestic orchestral music)

28
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,362
(bright music)

29
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,043
Willy!

30
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,850
Willy!
- Shh!

31
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,023
Teddy, if I don't make it back home alive,

32
00:02:28,957 --> 00:02:31,340
you gotta tell my girl I love her.

33
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,108
(bright music)

34
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:40,613
Incoming!

35
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:43,113
(Willy spits)

36
00:02:44,454 --> 00:02:45,288
No!

37
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:47,871
(Willy grunts)

38
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,776
- Damn it, Willy.

39
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,290
You always die first.

40
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,110
I never get to die first.

41
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,640
- Come on, come back.

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,667
Can't you tell my legs
are full of shrapnel!

43
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,667
I could shoot you from here and lame ya.

44
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,117
- [Teddy] I'm going swimming.

45
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,373
- Wait up!

46
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:10,553
(majestic orchestral music)

47
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:23,183
- The water is so cold.
- Yeah, I tell ya.

48
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,923
- We better pick up the
pace, we can't be too late.

49
00:03:30,923 --> 00:03:32,523
- Why is he always so mad?

50
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,090
- Who?

51
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,610
- Your daddy.

52
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,060
- Buck?

53
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,710
I don't know.

54
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:41,787
Think it might be all that drinkin'.

55
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:46,843
First the war, then Mama left him.

56
00:03:48,386 --> 00:03:50,036
You lucky you don't have a daddy.

57
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,023
- Take it back.

58
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,703
- What?

59
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:56,760
- I said take it back right now.

60
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,773
- Jeez Louise, Teddy, don't
got your panties in a bunch.

61
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,003
I just meant your lucky you
don't have a daddy that hits ya.

62
00:04:06,655 --> 00:04:10,460
I guess any daddy's better than no daddy.

63
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,543
- My daddy was a good
man, salt of the earth.

64
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:17,667
You think we got enough crawdads?

65
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,433
- Probably not.

66
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,373
I can handle the Buck,

67
00:04:22,373 --> 00:04:24,850
just make sure he's got plenty of drink.

68
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,150
He'll be asleep all night.

69
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,133
Teddy, look!

70
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,374
- [Teddy] What?

71
00:04:35,374 --> 00:04:36,590
- A quarter.

72
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,490
- Let me see that.

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,913
Wow, a real quarter.

74
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,034
- This is going in my getaway jar.

75
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:45,963
- Your what?

76
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,830
- I got a jar under my porch.

77
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,480
It's full of every change I find.

78
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,486
One of these days I'm
gonna run off from here.

79
00:04:53,486 --> 00:04:54,396
I ain't never coming back.

80
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,220
- You can't leave me, Willy.

81
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,754
You're my best friend,
what'll do I do without you?

82
00:04:59,754 --> 00:05:00,921
- Jeez, Teddy.

83
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,248
Hey.

84
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,415
I got an idea.

85
00:05:11,505 --> 00:05:14,486
(Willy groans)

86
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:16,620
Give me your hand, come on now.

87
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,890
- What are we like, eight?

88
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:21,777
- Well, I already cut myself
so you ain't backin' out now.

89
00:05:23,545 --> 00:05:25,962
(boys groan)

90
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:29,870
Now, we're full-on blood brothers.

91
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,470
Can't nobody ever take us apart.

92
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:35,500
- That stings.

93
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,110
Mama's not gonna like this.

94
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,898
She's gonna think I was being careless.

95
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:40,053
- She'll be all right.

96
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,006
- She lost her husband and her baby.

97
00:05:44,006 --> 00:05:45,606
Maybe we can cut her some slack.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
- Come on, let's go.

99
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:01,650
- That's it?

100
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,580
- Yup.

101
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,693
That's my getaway jar.

102
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,490
- Why is it full of dirt?

103
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,490
- It's not all dirt.

104
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,203
Feel how heavy.

105
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,631
'Cause if Buck finds it,

106
00:06:15,631 --> 00:06:18,460
he'll think it's a jar of
dried money nightcrawlers.

107
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,513
But really it's my jar of get away money.

108
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,920
Pretty smart, huh?

109
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,260
- Yeah.

110
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,620
So you water it down every
time you add money to it?

111
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,670
- Yes, sir.

112
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:29,090
Sometimes when he sleeps,

113
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,920
I can get some change from his pockets.

114
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,753
He never knows.

115
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,271
Dimes are my favorite 'cause they're small

116
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,371
and they add up quick.

117
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,003
He never notices a few
dimes here and there.

118
00:06:43,183 --> 00:06:45,193
- How much you think you got in there?

119
00:06:45,193 --> 00:06:48,970
- Hard to say, but I'm getting close.

120
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,013
- [Buck] That you boy?

121
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,733
Get on in here.

122
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,263
- Ah shit.

123
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,993
- You wanna have supper at my house?

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,610
- So, then Teddy gave me three dips.

125
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,587
That should get me in, right?

126
00:07:06,587 --> 00:07:08,700
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you boys.

127
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,240
You know this can get infected.

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,340
- That's what I told him,
and he didn't listen.

129
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,270
- [Willy] It's fine.

130
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,880
- All right, well you're clean for now.

131
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,623
I'm sure it won't stay that way.

132
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,570
- Hey Willy, you want to go
catch some lightning bugs?

133
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,470
- [Willy] Oh yeah.

134
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,450
- [Clara] All right.

135
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,474
- [Teddy] Come on.

136
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:31,259
(footsteps patter)

137
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:34,009
(crickets chirp)

138
00:07:35,481 --> 00:07:38,398
(footsteps patter)

139
00:07:43,258 --> 00:07:45,841
(light clicks)

140
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:49,200
- Where you been, boy?

141
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,716
- Me and Teddy was
catching lightning bugs.

142
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:52,650
- Well, I can see that.

143
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:53,500
I'm not an idiot.

144
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:55,563
Wipe your face.

145
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,083
So you with that boy, that bastard boy?

146
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:04,503
- His daddy died.

147
00:08:08,186 --> 00:08:09,400
(ominous music)

148
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
- So you went to that
Smallwood place again?

149
00:08:12,873 --> 00:08:14,138
- No, sir.

150
00:08:14,138 --> 00:08:16,155
(hand slaps)

151
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:18,853
- Don't you lie to me, you hear me?

152
00:08:18,853 --> 00:08:19,813
- Yes, sir.

153
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,167
- Go clean up, get to bed.

154
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,646
(train horn honks)

155
00:08:30,245 --> 00:08:32,828
(solemn music)

156
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:40,495
(horn whistles)

157
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:43,078
(solemn music)

158
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:50,004
(train chugs)

159
00:08:54,851 --> 00:08:57,236
(train carriages thud)
(whistle blows)

160
00:08:57,236 --> 00:08:58,144
- Dad!

161
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:00,216
(Teddy gasps)

162
00:09:00,216 --> 00:09:02,716
(birds chirp)

163
00:09:21,847 --> 00:09:23,490
- [Willy] Gotcha! (laughs)

164
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,888
- Dang it, Willy.

165
00:09:24,888 --> 00:09:26,000
You know what Buck might've done

166
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,008
if he saw me peaking in
his window like that?

167
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:30,900
- (laughs) Oh, he ain't gonna hurt nobody.

168
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,486
He's out like a light.

169
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:33,713
- What happened to you?

170
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:37,040
- I guess we didn't get enough crawdads.

171
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,873
- He hit you?

172
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,347
- Oh, I got him good.

173
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:42,140
I peed in his drink.

174
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:44,140
He's so drunk he don't even notice.

175
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,123
- That's not funny, Willy.

176
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,070
Look at your eye.

177
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,330
- Here you go.

178
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,640
Breakfast?

179
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,010
- No thanks, they'll give me the runs.

180
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:53,246
You too if you're not careful.

181
00:09:53,246 --> 00:09:54,246
- Not me.

182
00:09:54,246 --> 00:09:55,533
(teeth crunch)

183
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:59,660
Guts of steel!
(hand taps)

184
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,033
- So, what do you want to do today?

185
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:06,163
- I got an idea, let's have some fun.

186
00:10:07,252 --> 00:10:09,203
Hold my apple.

187
00:10:09,203 --> 00:10:11,870
(playful music)

188
00:10:26,771 --> 00:10:29,354
(bright music)

189
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:31,453
- Willy!

190
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,070
Buck's gonna kill us if he
finds us playing with his gun.

191
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,663
- Come on, don't be a scaredy cat.

192
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:39,028
You getting soft on me?

193
00:10:39,028 --> 00:10:39,948
- No.

194
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:41,550
- Come on!

195
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,979
- Willy!

196
00:10:42,979 --> 00:10:45,729
(sighs) Wait up.

197
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:53,005
(gunshot pops)
(body thuds)

198
00:10:53,005 --> 00:10:56,748
(Teddy groans)
(Willy laughs)

199
00:10:56,748 --> 00:11:00,360
- Oh, Teddy, I thought you
was gonna piss yourself.

200
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,731
- What?

201
00:11:01,731 --> 00:11:02,943
I can't hear a thing.

202
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,150
- [Willy] You done gone deaf soon.

203
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:09,033
- I just wasn't ready, that's all.

204
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:13,770
- Here, let me show you how to do it.

205
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,300
See that coffee mug?

206
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,563
I'm gonna get that one.

207
00:11:19,465 --> 00:11:20,660
(gunshot pops)

208
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,123
- [Teddy] Ha, you missed!

209
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:25,083
- I'll get it this time, you watch.

210
00:11:27,925 --> 00:11:29,033
(gunshot pops)

211
00:11:29,033 --> 00:11:31,140
(can rattles)

212
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,973
Yeah!

213
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:35,030
Told you so, got it
square between the eyes!

214
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:35,863
- Okay.

215
00:11:35,863 --> 00:11:36,696
Come on, let me try.

216
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:47,027
(trigger clicks)

217
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:50,423
I think we're outta bullets.

218
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:56,460
- Hey, how adventurous you feeling?

219
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,813
- Should I be worried?

220
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:02,035
(adventurous music)

221
00:12:03,502 --> 00:12:04,335
- Come on!

222
00:12:07,974 --> 00:12:10,391
(boys grunt)

223
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:18,882
(tractor idling)

224
00:12:18,882 --> 00:12:20,715
Listen, you hear that?

225
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,492
- Yeah, sounds like a tractor.

226
00:12:24,492 --> 00:12:26,014
- Come on, let's go!

227
00:12:26,014 --> 00:12:27,132
- Wait.
- Come on!

228
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:28,032
- No, wait, Willy.

229
00:12:30,185 --> 00:12:35,185
(tense music)
(tractor idling)

230
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,087
- Teddy, he left it idling.

231
00:12:42,411 --> 00:12:43,363
- Okay, so?

232
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,238
- Come on, let's go.

233
00:12:46,238 --> 00:12:48,637
- We can't just go take it.

234
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:52,183
- Teddy, it's like he's begging
for us to just go ride it.

235
00:12:52,183 --> 00:12:53,016
Let's go, come on!

236
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,012
- No, we can't just ride it.

237
00:12:54,012 --> 00:12:54,845
Wait, Willy.

238
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,353
- I'm going with or without you.

239
00:12:57,705 --> 00:12:58,952
(bright music)

240
00:12:58,952 --> 00:12:59,785
- Willy!

241
00:13:03,695 --> 00:13:04,860
- Climb up here.

242
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,544
- Me?
- Yes, you.

243
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:07,723
Come on.

244
00:13:07,723 --> 00:13:10,473
(tractor idles)

245
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,950
All right.

246
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,010
First, release the break.

247
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,675
Then you pull a little on the throttle.

248
00:13:15,675 --> 00:13:17,100
- This thing?

249
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,248
- That's it.

250
00:13:18,248 --> 00:13:21,048
Now, it ain't easy, but you
gotta get it out of neutral.

251
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,093
Put it into gear.

252
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:28,273
(tractor engine hums)

253
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:29,619
Throttle, throttle!

254
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:32,163
- I'm trying.

255
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:35,163
(chuckles) Woo hoo!

256
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:38,589
- Come on!
- I'm trying!

257
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,511
I'm getting it!

258
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,650
I'm like a tank! (roars)

259
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,022
- You shoot the missiles and
I'll take the ground cover.

260
00:13:46,022 --> 00:13:47,022
- Yeah, woo!

261
00:13:48,371 --> 00:13:49,400
- Come on, pick it up!

262
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,201
- I can't go any faster!

263
00:13:52,201 --> 00:13:54,620
- I can literally run circles around you.

264
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,447
- I'm going through the compound!

265
00:13:59,447 --> 00:14:00,280
Woo!

266
00:14:02,393 --> 00:14:04,976
(Teddy laughs)

267
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,665
(suspenseful music)

268
00:14:15,665 --> 00:14:17,137
Woo!

269
00:14:17,137 --> 00:14:17,995
Yeah!

270
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,078
Willy, Willy!

271
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:21,537
Willy!

272
00:14:21,537 --> 00:14:23,370
Willy, stop, stop, no!

273
00:14:24,244 --> 00:14:25,567
Willy!

274
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,750
Willy, stop!

275
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,250
Help, help, Willy!

276
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,503
Willy, stop, stop!

277
00:14:32,742 --> 00:14:33,575
No!

278
00:14:33,575 --> 00:14:38,575
♪ Just as I am, without one plea ♪

279
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,990
♪ But that Thy blood was shed for me ♪

280
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:53,364
♪ And that Thou bid'st me come to thee ♪

281
00:14:55,117 --> 00:15:00,117
♪ Oh lamb of God, I come ♪

282
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:03,605
♪ I come ♪

283
00:15:05,464 --> 00:15:07,964
(birds chirp)

284
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,813
- Folks.

285
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,580
These services are probably the hardest

286
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,680
for me to get through.

287
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,180
It ain't right

288
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:25,090
that any parent should ever
say goodbye to their child.

289
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:27,637
But Jesus said, "Let
the children come to me

290
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:29,457
"and do not hinder them."

291
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,193
For to such they belong
to the kingdom of heaven.

292
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:40,750
He heals the brokenhearted
and binds up their wounds.

293
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,270
For this child, I prayed
and was granted my petition.

294
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,010
Therefore, I have lent him to the Lord.

295
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:52,843
- Enough.

296
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,083
Open it.

297
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,418
- Mr. Stamper, I don't think
that's a very good idea.

298
00:16:08,418 --> 00:16:10,803
That little fellow's in some rough shape.

299
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,563
- I don't remember asking
you, now do I, Pastor?

300
00:16:16,493 --> 00:16:18,873
So if you'd so kindly do as I ask

301
00:16:18,873 --> 00:16:21,983
and open up the goddamn
casket before I kick it open.

302
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,733
(tense music)

303
00:16:42,915 --> 00:16:43,999
- Don't look.

304
00:16:49,113 --> 00:16:51,696
(solemn music)

305
00:16:55,662 --> 00:16:58,995
(Teddy whimpers softly)

306
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:07,406
- Look at him.

307
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:08,428
Look at him!

308
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,928
(Teddy cries)

309
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:15,626
You did this.

310
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:16,972
You did this.

311
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:18,500
- Teddy!

312
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,359
- You killed my boy!

313
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,416
You killed my boy!

314
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,863
(solemn music)

315
00:17:34,948 --> 00:17:37,365
(shoes thud)

316
00:17:38,769 --> 00:17:41,352
(solemn music)

317
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:49,042
(Teddy whimpers softly)

318
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:05,290
- Now, let's have a look.

319
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:11,043
- What you working on?

320
00:18:12,281 --> 00:18:14,063
- Just a silly little drawing.

321
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,180
- Hey, don't sell
yourself short, young man.

322
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,310
You are quite the artist.

323
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,860
Your daddy loved your drawings.

324
00:18:22,746 --> 00:18:24,525
(car engine hums)

325
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:27,025
(tense music)

326
00:18:29,504 --> 00:18:31,192
- Mom, it's Buck.

327
00:18:31,192 --> 00:18:32,420
He's got a gun.

328
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,230
- Teddy, take the girls to their room.

329
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,433
Girls, go with Teddy.

330
00:18:36,591 --> 00:18:41,591
(tense music)
(crickets chirp)

331
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,793
Can I help you, Mr. Stamper?

332
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:50,163
- Send that boy out here.

333
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:53,150
- Mr. Stamper, I think
you had a little bit

334
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:54,133
too much to drink.

335
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,274
- Don't you tell me anything, woman.

336
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:59,986
I said send that boy out here right now.

337
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:01,580
- I will do no such thing.

338
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,406
Now you best be leaving my home.

339
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:06,906
(rifle cocks)

340
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:10,923
- The way I see it, you got two choices.

341
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,450
You either send that boy
out here and I kill him,

342
00:19:15,376 --> 00:19:16,933
or you give that boy to me.

343
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,380
It's the only right way.

344
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,597
It's the only right
way, an eye for an eye.

345
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:28,380
Your boy killed mine, now I kill yours.

346
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,420
- [Clara] You ain't taking my boy.

347
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,487
- I'll kill him, it's your choice.

348
00:19:32,487 --> 00:19:34,590
- Like hell you will.

349
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:37,090
(tense music)

350
00:19:41,892 --> 00:19:46,423
What happened to Willy was
tragic, but it was an accident.

351
00:19:47,974 --> 00:19:52,513
I know you are in pain,
but my Teddy loved him.

352
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,300
I loved him.

353
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,653
You aren't the only one mourning here.

354
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:03,803
So, I advise you to go
home and sleep it off.

355
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,420
- You don't preach to me.

356
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:16,032
Now that boy's coming
with me, dead or alive.

357
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:18,232
And if I have to take
all you out, so be it.

358
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,250
I got enough bullets.

359
00:20:24,177 --> 00:20:26,050
- It's okay, Mom, I'll go.

360
00:20:27,715 --> 00:20:30,215
(tense music)

361
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:34,869
I don't want anyone else to get hurt.

362
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,918
- Teddy, you get back
inside, he can't take you.

363
00:20:37,918 --> 00:20:39,281
You get back inside.

364
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:41,528
- Mom, Mom, Mom!
- Teddy, no.

365
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,757
Teddy, let him go!

366
00:20:43,757 --> 00:20:45,448
Let him go!
- Please stop!

367
00:20:45,448 --> 00:20:49,262
(Clara shouts)
(Buck groans)

368
00:20:49,262 --> 00:20:51,795
(foot thuds)
(Buck grunts)

369
00:20:51,795 --> 00:20:54,257
(Teddy shouts)

370
00:20:54,257 --> 00:20:55,090
- No, Mom!

371
00:20:56,497 --> 00:20:59,018
(Buck grunts)
(motor hums)

372
00:20:59,018 --> 00:21:00,376
- Teddy!

373
00:21:00,376 --> 00:21:01,857
Girls, get back in the house!

374
00:21:01,857 --> 00:21:04,225
Get back in the house, lock the door!

375
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:05,535
Lock the door!

376
00:21:05,535 --> 00:21:06,952
No, Teddy, Teddy.

377
00:21:09,531 --> 00:21:10,364
- Mom!

378
00:21:10,364 --> 00:21:11,197
- Huh?

379
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:12,293
- No, no, don't hurt her, please!

380
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:13,637
- He's my boy now.

381
00:21:14,566 --> 00:21:17,614
You say goodbye, son.

382
00:21:17,614 --> 00:21:19,757
He'll never come back.

383
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:21,140
- Teddy, no, don't!

384
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:22,836
You son of a bitch!

385
00:21:22,836 --> 00:21:25,223
No, Teddy!

386
00:21:25,223 --> 00:21:27,806
(solemn music)

387
00:21:29,378 --> 00:21:30,211
No!

388
00:21:31,534 --> 00:21:35,367
No! (cries)

389
00:21:38,999 --> 00:21:41,999
(suspenseful music)

390
00:21:43,490 --> 00:21:44,323
- Get out.

391
00:21:45,668 --> 00:21:46,501
Get out.

392
00:21:48,761 --> 00:21:50,234
Get up.

393
00:21:50,234 --> 00:21:51,401
I said get up!

394
00:21:53,204 --> 00:21:58,204
(Teddy groans)
(Buck grunts)

395
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:02,020
(latch rattles)

396
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:05,570
(footsteps patter)

397
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:07,781
Welcome to your new home, boy.

398
00:22:07,781 --> 00:22:08,863
Way I see it.

399
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,820
If my boy has to sleep in the ground,

400
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:14,833
you sure as hell could sleep on it.

401
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,796
(door creaks)

402
00:22:18,796 --> 00:22:23,796
(Teddy whimpers)
(lock rattles)

403
00:22:25,185 --> 00:22:27,685
(Teddy cries)

404
00:22:38,289 --> 00:22:39,546
(birds chirp)

405
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:42,213
(rooster crows)

406
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,420
(door creaks)

407
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,253
Get up.

408
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
I said get up, come on, boy.

409
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,410
You're not gonna be lazy around here.

410
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,360
There's work to do.

411
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,410
Now get out to that
coop, bring in the eggs.

412
00:22:58,867 --> 00:23:01,764
You ain't so ignorant you
can't figure that out, right?

413
00:23:01,764 --> 00:23:02,681
- Yes, sir.

414
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:06,467
(rooster crows)

415
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,634
- I said git, come on now.

416
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,240
What is wrong with you, boy?

417
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,210
You messed up in the head

418
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:19,653
or do I have to get my belt on you?

419
00:23:19,653 --> 00:23:20,793
- I have to pee.

420
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:24,365
- Well, you know where the woods are.

421
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:26,765
Now, get to them chickens
and bring in the eggs.

422
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,963
I like mine over easy.

423
00:23:32,915 --> 00:23:34,270
And don't break my yolk.

424
00:23:39,055 --> 00:23:41,264
(rooster crows)

425
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:46,014
(cars hum)
(heels clack)

426
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:54,095
(door creaks)

427
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:57,746
(heels clack)

428
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:00,403
(doorknob rattles)

429
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:02,257
(hand bangs)

430
00:24:02,257 --> 00:24:03,381
- Hello?

431
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:05,537
(hand bangs)

432
00:24:05,537 --> 00:24:08,370
(spatula scrapes)

433
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:16,701
(spatula clangs)

434
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:25,182
(plate clatters)

435
00:24:29,921 --> 00:24:32,754
(coffee splashes)

436
00:24:42,813 --> 00:24:45,563
(plate clatters)

437
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:52,488
(toast snaps)

438
00:24:57,755 --> 00:25:00,338
(teeth crunch)

439
00:25:07,471 --> 00:25:10,304
(coffee splashes)

440
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:20,767
(liquor splashes)

441
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:29,344
(fork scrapes)

442
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,261
(footsteps patter)

443
00:25:36,786 --> 00:25:37,750
- Sheriff.

444
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,810
- I'm the deputy.

445
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,239
- He took my son.

446
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,150
- Hold on now.

447
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:44,044
You say somebody took your boy?

448
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,680
- Yes, Mr. Buck Stamper,
up on Adams Ridge.

449
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,263
- Stamper.
- He took my Teddy.

450
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:51,538
- He's the one who lost his boy, right?

451
00:25:51,538 --> 00:25:53,033
- Yes, please.

452
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,173
You have to help me.

453
00:25:56,170 --> 00:25:57,930
- Now, Ma'am, I reckon
this is a better job

454
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,740
for the sheriff himself.

455
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,312
- Fine, where is he?

456
00:26:01,312 --> 00:26:03,676
- Well, now he's in Charlottesville,

457
00:26:03,676 --> 00:26:05,193
and he'll be back tomorrow.

458
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:08,560
- You have to do something.

459
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,639
He is going to kill my boy.

460
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:12,894
- (sighs) My hands are tied.

461
00:26:12,894 --> 00:26:15,343
I promise you, the sheriff
will take care of it.

462
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,881
Now why don't you run along back home,

463
00:26:17,881 --> 00:26:19,700
and I'm going to call him in the morning.

464
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,900
- You're not gonna do nothing?

465
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,523
- Ma'am, I suggest you calm down.

466
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,410
Now that man is suffering,

467
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:30,450
and he's just lashing
out at your boy, okay?

468
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:31,400
We'll handle everything.

469
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,550
- You better pray hard
my son is all right.

470
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:36,793
- Oh, I'll pray.

471
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,166
You should pray too.

472
00:26:41,303 --> 00:26:44,553
After all, he did kill his boy.

473
00:26:47,876 --> 00:26:48,978
(door slams)

474
00:26:48,978 --> 00:26:49,811
- Coward!

475
00:26:51,296 --> 00:26:53,963
(broom scrapes)

476
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:59,199
(shoes thud)

477
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,423
- Sit.

478
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:03,563
I said sit.

479
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:13,050
You ain't walking around this
farm with that long hair.

480
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,800
It ain't clean, and you ain't
bringing lice into my home.

481
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,710
You best be still.

482
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:28,913
(bird warbles)

483
00:27:30,038 --> 00:27:32,705
(chain rattles)

484
00:27:35,467 --> 00:27:36,717
You better eat somethin'.

485
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,763
You're gonna need your
energy for tomorrow.

486
00:27:40,633 --> 00:27:42,620
You can make a bed out
of one of them bales.

487
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,423
Get another blanket from the horse.

488
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,517
(chain rattles)

489
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:02,670
(dramatic music)

490
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,313
- I'm coming home, Mama.

491
00:28:05,381 --> 00:28:08,214
(thrilling music)

492
00:28:10,571 --> 00:28:12,873
(door thumps)

493
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:15,706
(thrilling music)

494
00:28:23,897 --> 00:28:26,480
(hand scrapes)

495
00:28:32,049 --> 00:28:35,232
(thrilling music)

496
00:28:35,232 --> 00:28:36,210
(footsteps patter)

497
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,173
- I see you, boy.

498
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:45,557
(suspenseful music)

499
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:48,474
(footsteps patter)

500
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,964
(Teddy groans)

501
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,270
You think you could get away from me?

502
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,007
I own you, boy, come on!

503
00:28:58,007 --> 00:28:59,966
- Ow, ah, stop!

504
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:01,834
Please, please stop!

505
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,435
Ah, ah!

506
00:29:03,435 --> 00:29:08,435
(belt whips)
(Teddy screams)

507
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:11,273
No, ow, why are you doing this to me?

508
00:29:11,273 --> 00:29:13,378
Why? (screams)

509
00:29:13,378 --> 00:29:15,208
- [Buck] 'Cause you killed my boy.

510
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:17,736
You killed my boy!
- No, no, ow!

511
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:20,736
Please, stop!
- The only thing I had.

512
00:29:21,981 --> 00:29:23,220
Huh, you hear me?

513
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,430
You don't ever try to
run away from me again.

514
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,386
If you do, I'll take one
of them sisters of yours.

515
00:29:29,386 --> 00:29:33,106
If they run away, I'll take your Mama.

516
00:29:33,106 --> 00:29:33,961
Get up.

517
00:29:33,961 --> 00:29:34,961
Huh, get up.

518
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:41,505
(Teddy shouts)
(Buck grunts)

519
00:29:41,505 --> 00:29:46,505
(Buck grunts)
(Teddy groans)

520
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,594
I had a fine boy.

521
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:51,173
He was good, and now I got you.

522
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,263
Pathetic.

523
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:56,457
You ain't half the boy Willy was.

524
00:29:58,634 --> 00:30:01,504
(Teddy cries)

525
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:04,024
(door creaks)

526
00:30:04,024 --> 00:30:06,524
(Teddy cries)

527
00:30:11,133 --> 00:30:16,133
(engine hums)
(tires rumble)

528
00:30:29,166 --> 00:30:31,916
(car doors thud)

529
00:30:42,489 --> 00:30:44,989
(door creaks)

530
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,450
Morning, Sheriff.

531
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,450
Little early for a house call, ain't it?

532
00:30:51,507 --> 00:30:53,123
- Morning, Mr. Stamper.

533
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:55,783
Sorry to hear about your son.

534
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,720
I got Ms. Rogers here.

535
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,720
She tells me you came and
took her boy against his will.

536
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,297
Is that true?

537
00:31:09,297 --> 00:31:11,837
- Why don't you ask him yourself?

538
00:31:11,837 --> 00:31:15,262
(Teddy grunts)
(shoes thud)

539
00:31:15,262 --> 00:31:16,712
- What happened to you, baby?

540
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,810
- Now, boy, you want to tell
me what's going on here?

541
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,943
You got your Mama mighty
shooken up about this.

542
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,633
You afraid to talk, boy?

543
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,800
What happened to your face?

544
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,120
- Teddy, come on, let's go, baby.

545
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,420
He can't hurt you no more.

546
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:42,580
- Now, Buck.

547
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,360
I don't know what you have in mind here,

548
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,373
but that boy ain't yours.

549
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,860
He belongs...

550
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:50,260
- No!
- Home with his Mama.

551
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,483
- I fell off the truck.

552
00:31:57,726 --> 00:31:59,326
- [Sheriff] What'd you say, boy?

553
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,973
- I said I want to stay here.

554
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:07,873
This is where Willy was.

555
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,950
I don't want to go back with you.

556
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:19,070
- Now, it seems like we've
arrived at an impasse.

557
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,760
You heard the boy.

558
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:22,023
He wants to stay here.

559
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,433
- Boy, why don't you want to go home?

560
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,463
- This is my home.

561
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,521
I don't want to be with a bunch of girls.

562
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:34,473
I need a man in my life.

563
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,640
If you brought me back, I'd just run away.

564
00:32:44,850 --> 00:32:47,330
- Now, we'll just give him a few days.

565
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,590
- No, that is my son,

566
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:50,670
and I am not leaving here without him.

567
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,086
- Now, now, you heard the boy!

568
00:32:53,086 --> 00:32:53,919
- Teddy!

569
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,121
- We force him to go, he'll just come

570
00:32:55,121 --> 00:32:56,941
on right back.
- Teddy, come home!

571
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,354
Teddy, I love you, Teddy!

572
00:32:59,354 --> 00:33:00,887
Teddy, come home!

573
00:33:00,887 --> 00:33:01,720
- I guarantee...

574
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,138
- No, you have to stay,
you have to get him!

575
00:33:04,138 --> 00:33:06,661
- Give it just a few days.
- No, please!

576
00:33:06,661 --> 00:33:08,050
- He'll be running down your driveway

577
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,080
in just a few days now.
- Please, please.

578
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,670
- You just get on down now.
- Please.

579
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,379
- You know kids, now come on.

580
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:16,129
- Teddy, Teddy, I love you, baby!

581
00:33:17,415 --> 00:33:20,082
I love you, come home, Teddy!

582
00:33:20,082 --> 00:33:23,999
(melancholic orchestral music)

583
00:33:27,847 --> 00:33:29,495
Teddy!

584
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,099
Teddy!

585
00:33:31,099 --> 00:33:33,516
(motor hums)

586
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,777
(melancholic orchestral music)

587
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,862
(somber music)

588
00:34:31,043 --> 00:34:33,960
(footsteps patter)

589
00:34:53,762 --> 00:34:56,344
(dimes jangle)

590
00:35:01,221 --> 00:35:03,905
(birds chirp)

591
00:35:03,905 --> 00:35:06,572
(dishes scrape)

592
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,650
- Sounds like a goddamn parade in here.

593
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,763
Can you be any louder?

594
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,560
- It's Thursday, we need milk.

595
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,240
Gonna need to head into
town if we expect to be...

596
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,743
- Don't tell me what needs
to be done around here, boy.

597
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,980
- You want your egg fried?

598
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:24,730
- Don't I always want my egg fried?

599
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,263
- Yes, sir.

600
00:35:40,276 --> 00:35:42,693
(motor hums)

601
00:35:51,601 --> 00:35:54,101
(lid scrapes)

602
00:35:56,859 --> 00:35:59,276
(motor hums)

603
00:36:03,289 --> 00:36:04,636
- [Buck] What the hell
you doin' in here, boy?

604
00:36:04,636 --> 00:36:07,120
- Nothin', just thinkin'.

605
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,230
- You stealing from me?

606
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,423
- No, sir.

607
00:36:10,371 --> 00:36:12,290
Willy must have found that years ago.

608
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,041
- Don't you ever mention my boy!

609
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,433
Huh, you understand that?

610
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:18,553
He would have been one hell of a man

611
00:36:18,553 --> 00:36:21,021
had you not killed him.

612
00:36:21,021 --> 00:36:23,688
I'll teach you to steal from me.

613
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:30,220
(belt whips)
(Teddy groans)

614
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:37,724
(fist smashes)
(Teddy grunts)

615
00:36:37,886 --> 00:36:42,886

616
00:36:43,926 --> 00:36:46,926

618
00:36:53,729 --> 00:36:56,312
(knee smashes)

619
00:36:57,463 --> 00:36:58,972
Willy!

620
00:36:58,972 --> 00:37:00,560
Willy, help me!

621
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,993
- Don't you call on Willy.

622
00:37:03,270 --> 00:37:04,883
You never cared about him.

623
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:06,883
We did all the work.

624
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:13,480
When Willy died, I took his place,

625
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,157
but this ends tonight you
will never hurt me again,

626
00:37:18,157 --> 00:37:20,363
and you will never
threaten my family again.

627
00:37:23,877 --> 00:37:26,377
(tense music)

628
00:37:30,863 --> 00:37:33,446

629
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:39,233

631

(gasoline splashes)

632

638
00:39:02,003 --> 00:39:04,753

639
00:39:09,701 --> 00:39:12,701
(suspenseful music)

640
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:39,269
(dramatic music)

641
00:39:39,269 --> 00:39:42,269
(suspenseful music)

642
00:39:57,868 --> 00:40:00,540

(shoes thud)

646
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,290
Mama!

647
00:40:24,290 --> 00:40:25,290
Girls, anybody home?

648
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,643
Hello?

649
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,891
Mama?

650
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,308
(shoes thud)

651
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,520
Mama?

652
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,843
Girls, come on, anybody?

653
00:40:41,935 --> 00:40:42,768
Hello?

654
00:40:45,643 --> 00:40:49,829
Mama?
(shoes thud)

655
00:40:49,829 --> 00:40:50,662
Girls.

656
00:40:52,775 --> 00:40:55,442
(Teddy panting)

657
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:59,386
(head thuds)

658
00:41:01,402 --> 00:41:04,152

(water splashes)

665
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:05,737
Thank you, Willy.

666
00:42:10,524 --> 00:42:12,744
(glass shatters)

667
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:15,013
(majestic music)

668
00:42:15,013 --> 00:42:17,263
(cars hum)

669
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:22,709
(people chatter)

670
00:42:25,634 --> 00:42:28,384
(majestic music)

671
00:42:33,139 --> 00:42:35,556
(shoes thud)

672
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,110
- What are your plans for the day?

673
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:47,926
- Well, we were supposed to
have a picnic, but the rain.

674
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:50,080
- (laughs) Isn't that always the way?

675
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,490
- Always.

676
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,573
- Okay, that'll be five cents please.

677
00:42:54,865 --> 00:42:56,350
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

678
00:42:56,350 --> 00:42:57,510
Here you are.
- Have a good day.

679
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,446
- You too.

680
00:42:58,446 --> 00:43:01,196
(register rings)

681
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:02,903
Can I help you?

682
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:05,180
- Me?

683
00:43:05,180 --> 00:43:07,270
- I'm not looking at
anybody else, now am I?

684
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:08,103
- No, Ma'am.

685
00:43:09,710 --> 00:43:13,020
- How much for an apple
and two jerky sticks?

686
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:15,440
- That'll set you back about four cents.

687
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,780
- And a hard boiled egg.

688
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,512
- Another two cents.

689
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,512
- All right.

690
00:43:25,590 --> 00:43:28,113
- That'll be 6 cents there, big spender.

691
00:43:31,690 --> 00:43:32,523
You all right?

692
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,940
- Oh my goodness.

693
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:40,420
I don't need all this!

694
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,230
Unless you'll be needing half the store!

695
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:43,063
- No, Ma'am.

696
00:43:44,096 --> 00:43:46,423
I think that'll be all.

697
00:43:47,848 --> 00:43:50,150
(register dings)

698
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,400
- You forgot your change.

699
00:44:00,608 --> 00:44:02,985
(door creaks)

700
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:05,402

(footsteps patter)

704
00:44:29,748 --> 00:44:31,748
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

705
00:44:31,748 --> 00:44:35,233
Pardon me, pardon me.

706
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:37,489
(man groans)

707
00:44:37,489 --> 00:44:38,489
Here you go.

708
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:42,901
(footsteps patter)

709
00:44:45,197 --> 00:44:48,356
Hey, Willy!
- Can I help you?

710
00:44:48,356 --> 00:44:50,106
- Um, I'm sorry, sir.

711
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:54,200
You know where public records are?

712
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,033
- That way.

713
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:00,303
- Thank you.

714
00:45:02,413 --> 00:45:07,253
(footsteps patter)
(women chatter softly)

715
00:45:07,253 --> 00:45:09,746
Oh, oh my gosh, I am so sorry.

716
00:45:09,746 --> 00:45:13,250
- Oh no, they were all
separated by jurisdiction.

717
00:45:13,250 --> 00:45:14,170
- I'll gladly help.

718
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:15,670
- It's all right, I can do it.

719
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:19,050
- [Man] (groans) Sarah.

720
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,943
- I can resort them.

721
00:45:20,943 --> 00:45:22,920
- It's my fault, sir.

722
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,250
- [Man] Are you from around here?

723
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:26,083
- No, sir.

724
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:27,943
Just looking for somebody.

725
00:45:27,943 --> 00:45:30,130
- Who you looking for?

726
00:45:30,130 --> 00:45:31,580
- Clara Rogers.

727
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:34,063
Maybe you got records or
a forwarding statement?

728
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:36,710
- Clara Rogers.

729
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,780
You mean Old Widow Rogers up on the Ridge?

730
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:40,613
- Yes, sir.

731
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:41,730
I believe that's her.

732
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,970
- There's no forwarding address for her.

733
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,820
You might want to check the cemetery.

734
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:48,010
- Beg your pardon?

735
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,170
- After her husband died, her
boy, he killed another boy.

736
00:45:54,170 --> 00:45:56,060
And then he ran off.

737
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,047
And then she got scarlet fever real bad,

738
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,273
and the state came and took her girls.

739
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,840
Why are you asking?

740
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,420
- I'm mostly interested in her place.

741
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,810
- Well, in that case I'd try the bank.

742
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:11,060
They'd have the records
and lien information.

743
00:46:12,248 --> 00:46:13,648
(hand taps)
Good luck, son.

744
00:46:14,887 --> 00:46:17,804
(footsteps patter)

745
00:46:18,662 --> 00:46:20,656
It's a good farm.

746
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,323
Somebody oughta be living in it.

747
00:46:24,745 --> 00:46:27,662
(footsteps patter)

748
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:32,150
(dramatic music)
(footsteps thud)

749
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:34,264
- Whoa, hey, hey, whoa, whoa, easy now.

750
00:46:34,264 --> 00:46:35,507
- I need to get help.

751
00:46:35,507 --> 00:46:36,497
- What's wrong, is that blood?

752
00:46:36,497 --> 00:46:37,750
Are you okay?

753
00:46:37,750 --> 00:46:39,520
- We snuck into the mill
when everyone left for lunch

754
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,030
and Paul, he's trapped inside the gears.

755
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,882
He's bleeding pretty bad.

756
00:46:42,882 --> 00:46:43,890
We're in so much trouble.

757
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,132
- Just tell me, where is he?

758
00:46:45,132 --> 00:46:46,980
- Downstairs of the Wells grain mill.

759
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:48,650
In the grinding room.

760
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:49,483
- Okay.

761
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:53,674
(suspenseful music)

762
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,808
- I need a big stick, like
a garden rake or something.

763
00:46:57,808 --> 00:46:59,163
- Oh, um.

764
00:47:01,554 --> 00:47:04,394
(footsteps thud)

765
00:47:04,394 --> 00:47:07,144
(dramatic music)

766
00:47:12,468 --> 00:47:13,301
- Gosh

767
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:17,886
(footsteps thud)

768
00:47:17,886 --> 00:47:20,469
(Teddy grunts)

769
00:47:21,458 --> 00:47:22,908
- [Elizabeth] Here, try this.

770
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:26,880
(Teddy grunts)

771
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:29,745
- You gotta come over here.
- Okay.

772
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:30,755
Okay, okay, okay.

773
00:47:30,755 --> 00:47:31,960
- Okay, come on, grab him, grab him.

774
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:32,793
Okay, ready, pull.

775
00:47:32,793 --> 00:47:34,325
- Okay.
- Pull, now!

776
00:47:34,325 --> 00:47:37,711
(Teddy grunts)

777
00:47:37,711 --> 00:47:39,145
(Elizabeth grunts)

778
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:41,658
- [Elizabeth] Oh my God, oh my God.

779
00:47:41,658 --> 00:47:45,992
(dramatic music)
(footsteps thud)

780
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:47,620
- Hey, he needs a doctor, quickly.

781
00:47:47,620 --> 00:47:49,970
- [Man] Uh, I can take
him, follow me, come on!

782
00:47:51,030 --> 00:47:52,016
- Careful, careful.

783
00:47:52,016 --> 00:47:55,320
(Teddy grunts)

784
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,153
- Guys, come on.

785
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,258
Doc, Doc, there's been an accident.

786
00:48:04,258 --> 00:48:06,570
It's Mr. Wells's nephew, sir, it's Paul.

787
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:08,453
- Dear God, put him on the table.

788
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:14,590
- Greta has the day off today.

789
00:48:14,590 --> 00:48:16,626
I'm gonna need one of you
boys to stay and help.

790
00:48:16,626 --> 00:48:17,534
(Doc groans)

791
00:48:17,534 --> 00:48:18,713
That's not gonna work.

792
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:25,590
Can you tell me how long
he's been unconscious?

793
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,283
Son, you with me here?

794
00:48:31,166 --> 00:48:34,083
(footsteps patter)

795
00:48:36,766 --> 00:48:39,364
(doorbell chimes)

796
00:48:39,364 --> 00:48:41,340
- What the hell happened to you?

797
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,230
- Passed out from the blood, sir.

798
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,063
It's mighty bad.

799
00:48:44,063 --> 00:48:45,330
- Why don't you head back to the mill.

800
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,867
We got a pretty big mess to clean up.

801
00:48:46,867 --> 00:48:49,700
(doorbell chimes)

802
00:48:52,394 --> 00:48:55,210
- What in the Sam Hills
all the ringing in here.

803
00:48:55,210 --> 00:48:57,170
Oh, Clarence.

804
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,708
Suppose you're here to
check on your nephew.

805
00:48:58,708 --> 00:49:00,790
- How is he, Doc, I
heard it was pretty bad.

806
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:03,323
- You heard right, but he's gonna make it.

807
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:09,290
The leg, I'm not so sure,
but we did our best.

808
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:11,590
If it wasn't for your employee back there

809
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,560
helping with the boy,

810
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,810
your nephew might be talking to St. Peter.

811
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,830
- You mean Howard, who just left?

812
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:20,160
- No, the young man in back.

813
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,540
He stayed and helped me stabilize him.

814
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,560
Couldn't have done it by myself.

815
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,160
Sheriff is bringing an
ambulance to get him

816
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:27,360
over to Charlottesville.

817
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:32,700
- If you won't be
needing me any more, sir,

818
00:49:32,700 --> 00:49:34,470
I think I'm gonna head out.

819
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:35,340
- What's your name, son?

820
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,173
- Ted.

821
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:37,780
Uh, Theodore, sir.

822
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:38,920
Theodore Rogers.

823
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,990
- Hell of a job, Mr. Rogers.

824
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:42,600
That boy owes you his life.

825
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,600
- Glad I could help.

826
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,153
- Hey, hey, son!

827
00:49:49,153 --> 00:49:50,841
Hey, stop there!
- Sir?

828
00:49:50,841 --> 00:49:53,320
- I'm Mr. Wells, I'm
the owner of that mill.

829
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,101
So you're the fella that
carried Paul from the mill here?

830
00:49:55,101 --> 00:49:57,390
- (stammers) Yes, sir.

831
00:49:57,390 --> 00:49:59,083
- I need to shake your hand.

832
00:49:59,083 --> 00:50:00,590
You saved that boy's life.

833
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:02,470
- I just carried him.

834
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:05,143
- Don't be humble, you
did an amazing thing.

835
00:50:05,143 --> 00:50:06,450
You looking for a job?

836
00:50:06,450 --> 00:50:07,915
- Oh yes, yes, sir.

837
00:50:07,915 --> 00:50:09,887
- Be at the mill at dawn tomorrow.

838
00:50:09,887 --> 00:50:11,970
I'll have a job waiting for you.

839
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,342
How's $8 a week sound?

840
00:50:13,342 --> 00:50:15,640
- That's fine, I'll be there.

841
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,850
- Starting tomorrow, you can
use one of our delivery trucks

842
00:50:17,850 --> 00:50:20,210
to go to and from and to get your own.

843
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:23,330
All right, get on out of
here and change them clothes.

844
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:24,480
You're a fearful sight!

845
00:50:27,026 --> 00:50:29,443
(shoes thud)

846
00:50:30,730 --> 00:50:33,820
Gentlemen, you remember Theodore Rogers.

847
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,470
He's gonna be delivering with us.

848
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,620
Let me show you how we do this.

849
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,550
Now on Tuesdays and Thursdays,

850
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:42,309
you come over here and
you see how many bags

851
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:44,950
go to Charlottesville, how
many bags go to Jacksonville.

852
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:48,660
Now, each driver's responsible
for their own vehicle.

853
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:51,220
You fill it, deliver it and get
it back here by supper time.

854
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:54,035
The rest of the days, you just
spend here filling the bags

855
00:50:54,035 --> 00:50:57,350
and grinding the corn
into mash, sound good?

856
00:50:57,350 --> 00:50:58,183
- I can do this.

857
00:50:58,183 --> 00:50:59,153
Thank you for the opportunity.

858
00:51:00,853 --> 00:51:05,215
- Oh, and Theodore,
next time you play hero,

859
00:51:05,215 --> 00:51:07,481
try to spare me some equipment.

860
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,467
(Teddy chuckles)

861
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:12,634
(mill machinery hums)

862
00:51:17,953 --> 00:51:20,370
(motor hums)

863
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:26,267
(bags thud)
(Teddy grunts)

864
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:31,226
(car door slams)

865
00:51:35,218 --> 00:51:37,968
(handle rattles)

866
00:51:40,437 --> 00:51:42,887
(Elizabeth chuckles)

867
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:45,804
(footsteps patter)

868
00:51:52,221 --> 00:51:53,971
- You all right there, big spender?

869
00:51:55,479 --> 00:51:57,005
- Yeah, yeah.

870
00:51:57,005 --> 00:51:59,260
I'm just used to cranking
it a little differently.

871
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:00,150
- Oh yeah, sure.

872
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,750
Those cranks can be real tricky.

873
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,380
You have no idea what
you're doing, do you?

874
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:07,339
- It's been a while.

875
00:52:07,339 --> 00:52:08,539
- (laughs) All right so.

876
00:52:13,403 --> 00:52:16,350
(groans) Just start your engine.

877
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,531
You're gonna want to press
on that lever to your right

878
00:52:18,531 --> 00:52:21,010
and turn your key.

879
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:22,700
That's your coil buck switch.

880
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,880
Good job.
- Okay.

881
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,958
- Now, you need to make
sure your car is in neutral,

882
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:27,960
which is this lever in the center.

883
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,770
- Okay, right here?
- Mm-hmm.

884
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,530
Now, you have two pedals on your left,

885
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,200
which are your clutch and your brake.

886
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,764
And then this pedal on the
right is your accelerator,

887
00:52:37,764 --> 00:52:40,210
which is going to advance the car.

888
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,955
So, first we clutch and then you gas.

889
00:52:43,955 --> 00:52:45,870
(tires rumble)

890
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,950
Good job.

891
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:48,790
Now actually, if you turn right up here,

892
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:50,440
I know a really good
place for you to practice

893
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,993
before you head out for delivery.

894
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:57,968
(tires rumble)
(motor hums)

895
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,400
Good job.

896
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,470
Good job!

897
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,820
Now, you need to make
sure that it's in neutral

898
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:07,828
before you try and start it again.

899
00:53:07,828 --> 00:53:10,410
(laughs) You'll get it.

900
00:53:10,410 --> 00:53:13,214
Not too bad for your first driving lesson.

901
00:53:13,214 --> 00:53:16,520
- Second, it's my second time.

902
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,270
- Well, you're a very good cranker.

903
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,710
So, are you going to drive me back to town

904
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:26,986
or do I need to walk home?

905
00:53:26,986 --> 00:53:29,194
- Sorry, I'll take you home.

906
00:53:29,194 --> 00:53:32,277
(engine revs softly)

907
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:35,653
- (laughs) I'm glad you
remembered the lever.

908
00:53:38,302 --> 00:53:43,219
(motor hums)
(birds chirp)

909
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,617
(motor hums)

910
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:59,156
(door thuds)

911
00:54:02,384 --> 00:54:03,801
- Can I help you?

912
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,630
- Yes, I have a delivery.

913
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,160
Cornmeal from Wells Feed and Grain.

914
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:09,823
- Ah, you must be our new driver.

915
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:12,653
- It's you!

916
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,233
You're a real hero.

917
00:54:16,947 --> 00:54:20,123
Good news spreads like
wildfire around these parts.

918
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,093
- 10 bags, that sound right?

919
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,260
- Yes, Ma'am.

920
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:28,002
- You can put 'em in
the back with the rest.

921
00:54:28,002 --> 00:54:30,400
Melanie will show you where.

922
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,250
- Right this way.

923
00:54:35,350 --> 00:54:36,183
- [Woman] Go on girls.

924
00:54:36,183 --> 00:54:37,723
- Candy!
- Candy!

925
00:54:37,723 --> 00:54:40,483
- Girls, no running, be respectful.

926
00:54:40,483 --> 00:54:41,750
(girls chatter)

927
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:44,310
- One piece each, girls, just one.

928
00:54:44,310 --> 00:54:45,486
- [Woman] You both excited?

929
00:54:45,486 --> 00:54:48,798
- Yes.
- Yes, all right.

930
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:50,290
There you go.

931
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:51,920
You're picking out the two very best ones.

932
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,177
- [Girl] Mine is bigger than yours.

933
00:54:53,177 --> 00:54:55,830
- Let me show you what
we got in the other day.

934
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:56,663
Come over here.

935
00:54:57,703 --> 00:54:59,825
Look at these little twin dolls.

936
00:54:59,825 --> 00:55:01,620
Don't they look just like you?

937
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:02,855
Look at their twin dresses.

938
00:55:02,855 --> 00:55:03,922
- This one looks like me.

939
00:55:03,922 --> 00:55:06,462
- This one looks like me.

940
00:55:06,462 --> 00:55:09,067
(gentle music)

941
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:10,597
- What about this one over here?

942
00:55:10,597 --> 00:55:12,791
(people chatter softly)

943
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:15,958
Nice to see you, stay out of the heat.

944
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,070
- That family that was just in here.

945
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:22,274
- Reverend McCall, them little girls?

946
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:24,136
- Yeah.

947
00:55:24,136 --> 00:55:26,000
Have they always lived here?

948
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:26,833
- Sure.

949
00:55:27,774 --> 00:55:29,683
Except them little girls.

950
00:55:30,906 --> 00:55:34,090
Their Mama got real sick and
she couldn't take care of them.

951
00:55:34,090 --> 00:55:36,189
And the Reverend and
his wife weren't blessed

952
00:55:36,189 --> 00:55:38,993
with any children so they stepped in.

953
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,831
What part of the country are you from?

954
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:42,749
- Ma'am.

955
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:47,450
- You from Maysville or you
here in Charlotte, Jackson?

956
00:55:47,450 --> 00:55:49,540
- Oh, neither really.

957
00:55:49,540 --> 00:55:50,913
I'm just from up the Ridge.

958
00:55:52,130 --> 00:55:55,450
- You're awful young
to be out on your own.

959
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:56,753
- I'm almost 18, Ma'am.

960
00:55:58,040 --> 00:55:59,953
Thank you, have a good day.

961
00:56:12,372 --> 00:56:13,970
(distant thudding)

962
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:15,073
- Is that you, Daddy?

963
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:17,929
- Elizabeth.

964
00:56:17,929 --> 00:56:19,183
- Hi, Daddy.

965
00:56:21,537 --> 00:56:22,750
(lips smack)

966
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:24,590
What brings you into town this afternoon?

967
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,742
- Oh, thank you, darling.

968
00:56:25,742 --> 00:56:26,742
- Of course.

969
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,690
- I heard you got in the car
with some young man yesterday

970
00:56:36,690 --> 00:56:37,770
and headed outta town.

971
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:39,083
- You spying on me, Daddy?

972
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,810
- Spying is such a harsh word.

973
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,750
- He's not a stranger, he's a hero.

974
00:56:46,750 --> 00:56:47,661
Did you hear about that man

975
00:56:47,661 --> 00:56:49,673
who saved Paul Wells at the mill?

976
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:52,823
So you can see he's not all that scary.

977
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,940
- I heard you helped
in that rescue as well.

978
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,083
That's my girl.

979
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:03,790
What do you know about him?

980
00:57:06,230 --> 00:57:08,133
That's what makes him a stranger.

981
00:57:11,130 --> 00:57:13,013
- Hi, can I help you?

982
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:18,050
- Y'all got anything to drink around here?

983
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:19,752
- I can pour you a glass of sweet tea.

984
00:57:19,752 --> 00:57:21,480
- (scoffs) That's not exactly what I'm

985
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,730
in the market for, young lady.

986
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:26,270
- There's a little thing
called prohibition, sir.

987
00:57:26,270 --> 00:57:27,329
We don't break the law here.

988
00:57:27,329 --> 00:57:29,090
- Well then I guess I'll
just take some sugar

989
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:30,073
and corn mash then.

990
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,950
- I can get you the sugar,

991
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,100
but the mash is gonna be over at the mill.

992
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:37,600
- Well, that's about ignorant.

993
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,677
- I believe your time here is done.

994
00:57:40,677 --> 00:57:42,040
- Who the hell are you?

995
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:43,749
- You got no business here.

996
00:57:43,749 --> 00:57:46,610
- That's a hell of a
way to treat a patron.

997
00:57:46,610 --> 00:57:48,003
Show me some respect.

998
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,794
I could teach you a
thing or two, young lady.

999
00:57:51,794 --> 00:57:54,860
(chuckles) Oh.

1000
00:57:54,860 --> 00:57:55,693
- Daddy!

1001
00:57:55,693 --> 00:57:58,683
- All right, looks like
somebody struck a nerve.

1002
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:01,100
(motor hums)

1003
00:58:17,829 --> 00:58:20,746
(footsteps patter)

1004
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,140
- Hey, big spender.

1005
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:24,350
- Howdy, Ma'am.

1006
00:58:24,350 --> 00:58:27,080
- Howdy Ma'am, that's all you got to say?

1007
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:28,070
- Ma'am?

1008
00:58:28,070 --> 00:58:30,290
- You are quite the talk
about town, you know.

1009
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:32,162
A real life hero.

1010
00:58:32,162 --> 00:58:34,480
Oh, and humble too.

1011
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,519
- All in a day's work.

1012
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:36,763
- I spoke too soon.

1013
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:40,880
- I better get going, Mr.
Wells is expecting me.

1014
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:42,660
- Oh, but we don't want
to keep the mayor waiting.

1015
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:43,862
- Mr. Wells is the mayor?

1016
00:58:43,862 --> 00:58:45,293
- Where are you from hero?

1017
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,552
- Around.

1018
00:58:47,552 --> 00:58:49,573
- Oh, I like a mystery.

1019
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:52,480
What's the name a hero goes by nowadays?

1020
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,450
- Theodore.

1021
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,270
My name is Theodore Rogers.

1022
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,840
- Well, Theodore Rogers,

1023
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:03,841
you and I made a pretty
good team the other day.

1024
00:59:03,841 --> 00:59:05,991
Maybe we can work
together again some time.

1025
00:59:07,031 --> 00:59:08,787
Welcome to Maysville.

1026
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:10,833
- Say,

1027
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,900
what does a clerk from the
general store go by nowadays?

1028
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:19,488
- I'm gonna make you work for that one.

1029
00:59:19,488 --> 00:59:22,405
(footsteps patter)

1030
00:59:34,550 --> 00:59:37,763
- Mr. Wells, sir, I have your invoice.

1031
00:59:37,763 --> 00:59:41,500
- Well, I hope you have a
little bit more than an invoice.

1032
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:43,490
Like about 110 more things.

1033
00:59:43,490 --> 00:59:44,323
- Yes, sir.

1034
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,680
- I must admit I wasn't expecting

1035
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:50,500
to be carrying money like that.

1036
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:52,468
- You got nothing to worry about.

1037
00:59:52,468 --> 00:59:54,172
(chuckles) If you have any trouble,

1038
00:59:54,172 --> 00:59:56,868
use that Colt .45 under your seat.

1039
00:59:56,868 --> 00:59:58,330
Ain't nobody gonna bother you

1040
00:59:58,330 --> 00:59:59,993
with that peacemaker in your lap.

1041
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:02,637
- Night boss.

1042
01:00:02,637 --> 01:00:03,737
- See you later, boss.

1043
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:08,340
- Good night, boys,
see you in the morning!

1044
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,670
- Say, you hungry?

1045
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:11,092
- [Teddy] Yes, I could use a bite.

1046
01:00:11,092 --> 01:00:13,442
- Excellent, let's you
and me grab some supper.

1047
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:16,787
Have you eaten at that
restaurant in town yet?

1048
01:00:16,787 --> 01:00:20,240
- No, sir, but I must admit
I'm kind of short right now.

1049
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:21,540
Maybe another time?

1050
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,310
- Oh nonsense, my treat.

1051
01:00:23,310 --> 01:00:24,671
I'll tell you, Della
makes the best biscuits

1052
01:00:24,671 --> 01:00:27,103
and fried apples this
side of the Mississippi.

1053
01:00:29,265 --> 01:00:33,280
(guests chatter softly)

1054
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:34,772
- [Della] Well, here you go, gentlemen.

1055
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:36,410
Excuse me.

1056
01:00:36,410 --> 01:00:39,010
Will you be having any iced
tea with that or coffee?

1057
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,210
- Coffee?

1058
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,819
Thanks, Della.

1059
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:45,680
You know, son, for you to
drive the truck back here today

1060
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,190
with all that money in your pocket

1061
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:48,840
shows a lot about your character.

1062
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,310
I ain't never let nobody
but family deliver for me.

1063
01:00:53,823 --> 01:00:56,600
Of course, I never had a son of my own,

1064
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:00,760
but if I did, I'd hope he'd
have character like you.

1065
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:01,840
Integrity.

1066
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:02,690
- Thank you, sir.

1067
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:07,013
- Two coffees.

1068
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,610
Enjoy your dinner.

1069
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:10,443
- Thanks, Della.

1070
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,843
I'll tell you, them taters
have just the right crunch.

1071
01:01:15,680 --> 01:01:16,853
- They look delicious.

1072
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:25,260
Say, Mr. Wells, can I ask you a question?

1073
01:01:25,310 --> 01:01:27,439
- [Mr. Wells] Well, sure,
son, what do you need to know?

1074
01:01:27,439 --> 01:01:32,399
- Well, there's this young
girl over at the general store.

1075
01:01:32,399 --> 01:01:35,142
- Oh, Mr. Smallwood's daughter.

1076
01:01:35,142 --> 01:01:37,700
- Smallwood, like the
berry farm Smallwood?

1077
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:41,249
- Berry farm, general store, horse farm.

1078
01:01:41,249 --> 01:01:42,920
Good family.

1079
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:44,470
- What's her first name?

1080
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:45,810
- Elizabeth.

1081
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:47,200
She's the only daughter.

1082
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,243
Has three sons too.

1083
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:55,483
- Elizabeth Smallwood. (chuckles)

1084
01:01:57,884 --> 01:02:00,634
(utensils clang)

1085
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,810
Looks like it might rain later.

1086
01:02:07,810 --> 01:02:08,643
Thank you for dinner.

1087
01:02:08,643 --> 01:02:09,973
- My pleasure.

1088
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:15,431
Theodore, I think I'm
gonna give you an advance

1089
01:02:15,431 --> 01:02:17,995
on this week's salary.

1090
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,580
You never know when you might need to buy

1091
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:20,730
something at the store.

1092
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:24,280
- Why are you being so
kind to me, Mr. Wells?

1093
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:26,083
- I like you, you impressed me.

1094
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:29,170
Have a good evening.

1095
01:02:35,824 --> 01:02:38,324
(shoes clack)

1096
01:02:45,940 --> 01:02:48,130
- We gotta stop meeting like this.

1097
01:02:48,130 --> 01:02:50,884
- Well, hello there,
Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood.

1098
01:02:50,884 --> 01:02:54,140
- Gee, detective, that
sure didn't take long.

1099
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,375
You must've been working
real hard to get my name.

1100
01:02:56,375 --> 01:02:57,940
- Maybe.

1101
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,380
- [Elizabeth] How was your
ride to Charlottesville?

1102
01:02:59,380 --> 01:03:00,700
- Ah, it wasn't too bad.

1103
01:03:00,700 --> 01:03:02,292
- I'm glad.

1104
01:03:02,292 --> 01:03:05,170
(rain pours)

1105
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:06,730
Do you want another driving lesson?

1106
01:03:06,730 --> 01:03:08,543
- Yeah, that'd be nice.

1107
01:03:13,858 --> 01:03:17,040
(car door thuds)

1108
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,913
So, where do you want to go?

1109
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,250
- Now, where is the
romance in asking a woman

1110
01:03:22,250 --> 01:03:23,363
where she wants to go?

1111
01:03:24,282 --> 01:03:26,567
Take me somewhere I've never been.

1112
01:03:29,484 --> 01:03:32,234
(crickets chirp)

1113
01:03:34,390 --> 01:03:36,410
You did good, Mr. Rogers.

1114
01:03:36,410 --> 01:03:37,393
This is quite nice.

1115
01:03:38,768 --> 01:03:41,723
- I used to play here as a
child with my best friend.

1116
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,410
- I bet you fished and threw rocks

1117
01:03:44,410 --> 01:03:46,054
and caused all sorts of trouble.

1118
01:03:46,054 --> 01:03:48,004
- (chuckles) Yeah, something like that.

1119
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:51,473
You know, I baptized him
right there in that spot.

1120
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,820
- You were a strange kid, Mr. Rogers.

1121
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,160
What do you like to do now?

1122
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:00,680
Besides baptisms and lifesaving?

1123
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:01,710
- What do you mean?

1124
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:04,467
- For fun, you a wild man?

1125
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:08,020
- Oh, no, nothing really.

1126
01:04:08,020 --> 01:04:09,560
- Nothin'?

1127
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:10,860
Everybody likes something.

1128
01:04:11,965 --> 01:04:13,320
- I like to draw.

1129
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,730
- Michelangelo, aye?

1130
01:04:14,730 --> 01:04:16,245
- Michael, who?

1131
01:04:16,245 --> 01:04:18,400
- Theodore Rogers, you don't
know who Michelangelo is?

1132
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,622
- No, Ma'am, I'm not familiar
with any of the Angelo family.

1133
01:04:20,622 --> 01:04:23,453
- (laughs) He painted the Sistine Chapel.

1134
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,473
The Creation of Adam?

1135
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,663
The Statue of David?

1136
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,410
We're gonna need to work on this.

1137
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,360
Where are your folks?

1138
01:04:38,997 --> 01:04:40,163
- They're passed.

1139
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:42,293
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1140
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:44,900
Your best friend?

1141
01:04:49,530 --> 01:04:52,323
My, Mr. Rogers, you sure
hold some serious heartache.

1142
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,833
Is your world always this sad?

1143
01:04:56,154 --> 01:04:59,273
- Up until now, I reckon so.

1144
01:05:01,270 --> 01:05:03,470
- Well, I guess we'll
need to fix that then.

1145
01:05:06,828 --> 01:05:08,883
- What are you doing?

1146
01:05:10,087 --> 01:05:11,411
(zipper clatters)

1147
01:05:11,411 --> 01:05:13,035
Okay.

1148
01:05:13,035 --> 01:05:14,480
Yeah.

1149
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,613
And there's the dress, right.

1150
01:05:16,613 --> 01:05:19,142
(Elizabeth giggles)

1151
01:05:19,142 --> 01:05:20,242
(water splashes)

1152
01:05:20,242 --> 01:05:21,909
- Oh, it's freezing!

1153
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:25,126
- You'll catch your death.
- I'm fine.

1154
01:05:25,126 --> 01:05:26,776
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine!

1155
01:05:28,729 --> 01:05:29,810
(Elizabeth giggles)

1156
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:31,930
Baptize me, Theodore Rogers!

1157
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,492
Wash me of my sins of what I have done

1158
01:05:34,492 --> 01:05:36,643
and what I am about to do!

1159
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:40,180
- You are crazy.

1160
01:05:40,180 --> 01:05:41,580
- Made you smile, didn't it?

1161
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,383
No more heartache, Mr. Rogers.

1162
01:05:54,088 --> 01:05:56,505
(shoes thud)

1163
01:06:05,826 --> 01:06:08,576
(water splashes)

1164
01:06:13,966 --> 01:06:15,973
- You sure you want to do this?

1165
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:17,473
- Save my soul, Theodore.

1166
01:06:18,707 --> 01:06:21,457
(water splashes)

1167
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:30,700
(lips smack)

1168
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,563
I saw the light.

1169
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:40,290
- And we keep ending up in water.

1170
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:41,340
- It must be destiny.

1171
01:06:44,576 --> 01:06:46,990
(dramatic music)

1172
01:06:46,990 --> 01:06:47,823
- Theo.

1173
01:06:51,917 --> 01:06:53,489
- I need to go.

1174
01:06:53,489 --> 01:06:55,332
I should get you home.

1175
01:06:55,332 --> 01:06:58,082
(water splashes)

1176
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,460
- You'll need to take a right
at the fork in the road.

1177
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,770
- Is this a horse farm?

1178
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:14,000
- Yes, but don't go down the drive.

1179
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,280
Just drop me off at the driveway.

1180
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,040
- What kind of gentleman would I be

1181
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,900
if I didn't walk you to your front door?

1182
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:19,773
- A live one.

1183
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,333
- All right.

1184
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:29,530
- What happened back there?

1185
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,273
Are we just gonna pretend we
weren't having a good time?

1186
01:07:35,780 --> 01:07:37,430
- It's hard to explain.

1187
01:07:37,430 --> 01:07:38,394
- I got time.

1188
01:07:38,394 --> 01:07:40,510
(bell chiming)

1189
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,350
- Maybe not.

1190
01:07:42,350 --> 01:07:45,333
- You are saved by the
bell, Theodore Rogers.

1191
01:07:48,593 --> 01:07:49,830
(car door thuds)

1192
01:07:49,830 --> 01:07:50,733
And another thing,

1193
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:54,380
Theodore doesn't exactly
roll off the tongue.

1194
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,313
I'm gonna call you Theo or Teddy.

1195
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,873
- My mother called me Teddy.

1196
01:08:00,120 --> 01:08:01,780
- Theo it is.

1197
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,140
Sleep well, Theo.

1198
01:08:03,140 --> 01:08:04,549
I'll see you tomorrow.

1199
01:08:04,549 --> 01:08:07,299
(crickets chirp)

1200
01:08:10,456 --> 01:08:12,956
(head thumps)

1201
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:21,670
- It's pretty late.

1202
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:24,122
- Damn it, Daddy.

1203
01:08:25,200 --> 01:08:26,830
Not spying on me again?

1204
01:08:26,830 --> 01:08:29,740
- [Mr. Smallwood] Watch your
language, you're still a lady.

1205
01:08:29,740 --> 01:08:31,100
At least I hope so.

1206
01:08:31,100 --> 01:08:33,719
- What is that supposed
to mean, "hope so"?

1207
01:08:33,719 --> 01:08:35,219
- It's not proper for a young woman

1208
01:08:35,219 --> 01:08:37,800
to be gallivanting around
the whole damn country.

1209
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,303
- [Elizabeth] Watch your language.

1210
01:08:40,448 --> 01:08:43,490
(door creaks)

1211
01:08:43,490 --> 01:08:46,655
- With some boy in the
late hours of the night.

1212
01:08:46,655 --> 01:08:48,255
And don't you get saucy with me.

1213
01:08:49,477 --> 01:08:51,360
Why are you wet?

1214
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:54,210
- Well, Daddy, you have
nothing to worry about.

1215
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:59,210
He was a complete gentleman,
despite my overtures.

1216
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:02,290
So, you can sleep well tonight

1217
01:09:02,290 --> 01:09:06,987
knowing that your young, innocent
daughter is still a lady.

1218
01:09:09,068 --> 01:09:10,268
Good night.

1219
01:09:10,268 --> 01:09:13,184
(footsteps patter)

1220
01:09:20,048 --> 01:09:22,465
(motor hums)

1221
01:09:32,737 --> 01:09:35,487
(car door thuds)

1222
01:09:54,291 --> 01:09:56,708
(door thuds)

1223
01:10:03,809 --> 01:10:04,643
- Hello.

1224
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:07,303
- Theo.

1225
01:10:10,969 --> 01:10:12,820
- I hear you have the best sweet tea.

1226
01:10:13,782 --> 01:10:15,323
- You have good sources.

1227
01:10:18,545 --> 01:10:21,128
(tea splashes)

1228
01:10:29,969 --> 01:10:30,803
Well?

1229
01:10:31,660 --> 01:10:34,300
- Mm, yup, that's delicious.

1230
01:10:34,300 --> 01:10:35,133
Don't tell Della.

1231
01:10:35,133 --> 01:10:38,029
(Elizabeth laughs)

1232
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:40,460
I'm sorry about last night.

1233
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,523
I was wondering if maybe you
can give me a second chance.

1234
01:10:46,980 --> 01:10:48,596
- What exactly were you thinking?

1235
01:10:48,596 --> 01:10:51,112
- Oh, I have something in mind.

1236
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:57,623
You know, Elizabeth doesn't
exactly roll off the tongue.

1237
01:10:59,532 --> 01:11:00,743
I'm gonna call you Beth.

1238
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:05,008

(engine revs)

1255
01:13:09,716 --> 01:13:10,553
- Mr. Wells, sir.

1256
01:13:10,553 --> 01:13:11,930
I have your invoice and payment from

1257
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:14,517
Jacksonville this week.
- Oh, that's fine, Theo.

1258
01:13:14,517 --> 01:13:17,090
And thanks for all the hard
work you're putting in.

1259
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:18,216
How long has it been now?

1260
01:13:18,216 --> 01:13:19,900
- About three months, sir.

1261
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:21,210
- Three months.

1262
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:25,260
Never late, always willing to
lend a hand, strong as an ox.

1263
01:13:25,260 --> 01:13:28,150
I tell you, you're a
true asset to this mill.

1264
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:29,494
- Thank you, sir.

1265
01:13:29,494 --> 01:13:33,350
Not to be rude, but I
do have someone waiting.

1266
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:34,440
- Oh, I see.

1267
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:37,260
You got a cold refreshing
ice tea waiting for you,

1268
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:38,093
I presume?

1269
01:13:39,172 --> 01:13:43,423
You know, Theo, tea is a wonderful thing.

1270
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:49,257
It's cool when you need
it, warm when you need it.

1271
01:13:49,257 --> 01:13:51,737
But you can't let it sit too long.

1272
01:13:51,737 --> 01:13:53,263
The ice melts.

1273
01:13:54,508 --> 01:13:57,340
And the warmth wears off.

1274
01:13:57,340 --> 01:14:00,764
And then all you got is something
that's just sitting there.

1275
01:14:00,764 --> 01:14:03,733
If you really want to enjoy
the freshness of that tea,

1276
01:14:04,790 --> 01:14:06,540
you gotta take the necessary steps.

1277
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:10,343
Now, don't be pussyfooting around.

1278
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:13,932
- We still talking about tea, Mr. Wells?

1279
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:15,683
- (laughs) You tell me.

1280
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,300
Do you know, Theodore.

1281
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:23,370
I've never held the hand
of a woman after church.

1282
01:14:24,876 --> 01:14:27,576
Or carried a child to his
bed to tuck him in at night.

1283
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:31,969
Don't make the same mistakes I made, son.

1284
01:14:32,871 --> 01:14:34,420
Don't let time slip away.

1285
01:14:35,358 --> 01:14:37,941
(gentle music)

1286
01:14:46,910 --> 01:14:48,830
- [Elizabeth] You're back a little early.

1287
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:51,510
- Oh, light load in Jackson.

1288
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:53,603
- Extra sweet, just like you.

1289
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:57,602
- Oh.

1290
01:14:57,602 --> 01:14:58,700
- What?

1291
01:14:58,700 --> 01:14:59,850
- You're wearing pants.

1292
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:03,070
- Yes, is that a problem?

1293
01:15:03,070 --> 01:15:04,120
You know, I vote too.

1294
01:15:05,030 --> 01:15:07,559
- I've just never seen a
woman wear pants before.

1295
01:15:07,559 --> 01:15:08,900
- Well, there's a lot of things in me

1296
01:15:08,900 --> 01:15:11,190
you haven't seen, Theo Rogers.

1297
01:15:11,190 --> 01:15:12,820
Imagine what's in store for you.

1298
01:15:12,820 --> 01:15:13,808
- Keep talking like that

1299
01:15:13,808 --> 01:15:15,650
and you might have just a little kiss.

1300
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:16,980
- You do that in this town square

1301
01:15:16,980 --> 01:15:19,075
and this town would lock you up so fast.

1302
01:15:19,075 --> 01:15:20,643
- Oh, I'll take my chances.

1303
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:23,130
- Oh, I have a gift for you.

1304
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,800
It's a collection of Michelangelo's work.

1305
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:31,893
The Sistine Chapel is on page 72.

1306
01:15:35,017 --> 01:15:36,700
- Wow, thank you.

1307
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,366
- Mm-hmm.

1308
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:39,616
- You know I was thinking

1309
01:15:40,654 --> 01:15:42,469
I might take you somewhere tonight.

1310
01:15:42,469 --> 01:15:45,130
- You taking me back for
another dip in the creek?

1311
01:15:45,130 --> 01:15:46,290
You feeling sinful?

1312
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,623
- Oh, not quite.

1313
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:50,670
How about picking you up at six?

1314
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,770
Don't keep me waiting.

1315
01:15:59,491 --> 01:16:02,241
(car door slams)

1316
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:07,526
(lips smack softly)

1317
01:16:11,193 --> 01:16:14,550
- Theo, you can't be doing that in public.

1318
01:16:14,550 --> 01:16:16,702
- Sorry, I guess I can't help myself.

1319
01:16:18,570 --> 01:16:20,513
Sometimes you're just
more than I can handle.

1320
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:23,440
Say, you know that man?

1321
01:16:23,440 --> 01:16:24,940
Never seen him in town before.

1322
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:28,420
- He comes into the store every so often.

1323
01:16:28,420 --> 01:16:29,767
I don't know his name.

1324
01:16:29,767 --> 01:16:31,680
But he always smells like whiskey.

1325
01:16:31,680 --> 01:16:33,610
I guess every town needs a town drunk.

1326
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:34,633
- Yeah, I guess.

1327
01:16:35,510 --> 01:16:37,248
Thank you for the tea.

1328
01:16:37,248 --> 01:16:38,360
You know it means a lot.

1329
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,290
I'm grateful for every
time you give me this.

1330
01:16:41,290 --> 01:16:42,180
And the book.

1331
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,580
I can't wait to read through it.

1332
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,570
- Well, as long as you'll let me,

1333
01:16:45,570 --> 01:16:47,219
I will always have a tea for you,

1334
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:52,323
but now I have to get back to the store.

1335
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,150
I will see you tonight.

1336
01:16:56,043 --> 01:16:58,960
(footsteps patter)

1337
01:17:06,978 --> 01:17:08,759
(door thuds)

1338
01:17:08,759 --> 01:17:11,592
(Elizabeth sighs)

1339
01:17:25,441 --> 01:17:30,380
- [Mr. Smallwood] That was
quite the display out there.

1340
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:31,530
- Whatever do you mean?

1341
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:36,165
- You've been seeing that
boy for some time now.

1342
01:17:36,165 --> 01:17:38,452
- That boy has a name.

1343
01:17:41,475 --> 01:17:44,320
- I think it's time you bring him by.

1344
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,340
- Why, Daddy?

1345
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:47,219
So, you can tell him
that he's not good enough

1346
01:17:47,219 --> 01:17:48,370
for your only daughter?

1347
01:17:49,299 --> 01:17:51,782
- Now that's just not fair.

1348
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,090
- What's fair, Daddy?

1349
01:17:55,090 --> 01:17:57,971
Are you telling me you're gonna
welcome him with open arms

1350
01:17:57,971 --> 01:18:01,037
and say, "Welcome to the family, son."

1351
01:18:02,571 --> 01:18:04,493
- You gotta give me a chance first.

1352
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,963
He can't be all that bad
if you care about him.

1353
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:14,430
- Now, Daddy, don't you go
be an all supportive on me.

1354
01:18:15,740 --> 01:18:17,710
- I'll give him a chance, Elizabeth.

1355
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,500
- That's all I can ask for, Daddy.

1356
01:18:22,464 --> 01:18:23,297
Your move.

1357
01:18:24,894 --> 01:18:28,897
(pieces thud)
(Elizabeth laughs)

1358
01:18:28,897 --> 01:18:31,480
(bright music)

1359
01:18:41,632 --> 01:18:44,382
(car door thuds)

1360
01:18:52,630 --> 01:18:54,324
Where are we, Theo?

1361
01:18:54,324 --> 01:18:55,448
(car door thuds)

1362
01:18:55,448 --> 01:18:59,693
- (sighs) This is my home, I grew up here.

1363
01:19:01,130 --> 01:19:02,183
- It's beautiful.

1364
01:19:07,964 --> 01:19:10,547
(bright music)

1365
01:19:18,259 --> 01:19:21,175
(Elizabeth laughs)

1366
01:19:22,044 --> 01:19:27,044
(gasps) Theo, this is wonderful.

1367
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,219
Oh.

1368
01:19:32,219 --> 01:19:35,487
Well, thank you.

1369
01:19:35,487 --> 01:19:37,335
You have green beans!

1370
01:19:37,335 --> 01:19:38,373
- Yes, I do.

1371
01:19:40,460 --> 01:19:41,446
- Did you make those?

1372
01:19:41,446 --> 01:19:42,279
- I did.

1373
01:19:43,340 --> 01:19:45,020
- They look incredible.

1374
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,447
- And...

1375
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:47,950
- Did you get those from Della?

1376
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:49,830
- No, all me.

1377
01:19:49,830 --> 01:19:51,180
- Well, color me impressed.

1378
01:19:55,270 --> 01:19:56,410
- Well, I hope you're hungry.

1379
01:19:56,410 --> 01:19:57,320
Should still be warm.

1380
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:58,940
- It looks perfect.

1381
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,210
- You haven't even tasted it yet.

1382
01:20:00,210 --> 01:20:01,777
- I don't need to.

1383
01:20:01,777 --> 01:20:04,233
And you have such a lovely home.

1384
01:20:05,650 --> 01:20:07,400
- I tried to clean it a bit.

1385
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:09,251
It has sat its spell.

1386
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:11,683
- (laughs) It could use a woman's touch.

1387
01:20:12,532 --> 01:20:13,833
- I agree.

1388
01:20:19,559 --> 01:20:21,380
- Dinner was lovely.

1389
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,530
Where'd you learn to cook like that?

1390
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:25,475
- I used to cook for a
man I worked for once.

1391
01:20:25,475 --> 01:20:26,880
- Oh.

1392
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:31,880
Well, I would let you cook for me anytime,

1393
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,000
but don't break my egg
yolks, whatever you do.

1394
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:38,719
(tense music)

1395
01:20:38,719 --> 01:20:42,219
(Teddy clears his throat)

1396
01:20:45,518 --> 01:20:46,351
Theo?

1397
01:20:48,621 --> 01:20:49,454
Theo.

1398
01:20:53,691 --> 01:20:56,273
(gentle music)

1399
01:20:57,555 --> 01:21:01,388
Do you mind telling me
what happened in there?

1400
01:21:04,780 --> 01:21:06,180
Theo, you're doing it again.

1401
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:09,612
You're pushing me away.

1402
01:21:09,612 --> 01:21:11,817
What the hell is going on?

1403
01:21:11,817 --> 01:21:13,583
- He was not a good man.

1404
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,483
He was evil, he was horrible.

1405
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,603
- Who are you talking about, Theo?

1406
01:21:25,263 --> 01:21:27,059
- The man in town today.

1407
01:21:27,059 --> 01:21:29,038
- [Elizabeth] What man?

1408
01:21:29,038 --> 01:21:30,733
- The drunk.

1409
01:21:30,733 --> 01:21:31,566
He, uh...

1410
01:21:31,566 --> 01:21:33,612
- Theo, it's okay, I'm right here.

1411
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,680
- [Teddy] No, I'm just being stupid.

1412
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:42,683
- Theo.

1413
01:21:44,642 --> 01:21:47,413
If you do not let me in,

1414
01:21:47,413 --> 01:21:49,813
if you don't let me close to you.

1415
01:21:52,059 --> 01:21:55,063
Please, you have to let me help you.

1416
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:06,223
- He hurt me as a kid.

1417
01:22:09,570 --> 01:22:12,782
He hurt me when I worked at his farm.

1418
01:22:15,047 --> 01:22:16,152
He...

1419
01:22:16,152 --> 01:22:17,152
- It's okay.

1420
01:22:18,088 --> 01:22:20,143
It's okay, I'm so sorry.

1421
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:24,577
Theo I love you.

1422
01:22:26,094 --> 01:22:28,677
(bright music)

1423
01:22:32,666 --> 01:22:35,084
(lips smack)

1424
01:22:38,300 --> 01:22:43,300
(lips smack)
(bright music)

1425
01:23:16,396 --> 01:23:17,386
- You're the most beautiful woman

1426
01:23:17,386 --> 01:23:20,553
in the world, Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood.

1427
01:23:23,487 --> 01:23:25,154
I need to stop here.

1428
01:23:31,978 --> 01:23:33,996
Some things are just worth waiting for.

1429
01:23:45,825 --> 01:23:48,407
(tires rumble)

1430
01:23:56,496 --> 01:23:58,898
(car door thuds)

1431
01:23:58,898 --> 01:24:01,815
(distant thudding)

1432
01:24:16,021 --> 01:24:18,688
(safety clicks)

1433
01:24:40,715 --> 01:24:43,132
(shoes thud)

1434
01:24:47,797 --> 01:24:49,047
Can I help you?

1435
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,587
- It's alright, you can put away your gun.

1436
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:00,123
- Ma'am, do I know you?

1437
01:25:01,250 --> 01:25:02,083
- I know you.

1438
01:25:03,139 --> 01:25:05,219
- You're from Charlottesville?

1439
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:06,053
The Emporium.

1440
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,620
- I guess you could say that.

1441
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,787
Teddy.

1442
01:25:12,787 --> 01:25:15,320
(gentle music)

1443
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:16,719
- My family called me Teddy.

1444
01:25:17,639 --> 01:25:18,473
- That's right.

1445
01:25:20,684 --> 01:25:22,153
Do you remember me?

1446
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:26,333
Look closer.

1447
01:25:32,719 --> 01:25:35,887
It's all right, it's been a long time,

1448
01:25:37,607 --> 01:25:39,307
and I know a child's memory fades.

1449
01:25:45,414 --> 01:25:47,331
- My, how you've grown.

1450
01:25:55,389 --> 01:25:56,222
- Mama?

1451
01:25:59,590 --> 01:26:02,416
So, how long have you known?

1452
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,260
- About a month?

1453
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:08,577
Mr. Wells confirmed it for me.

1454
01:26:08,577 --> 01:26:12,520
He told me about your
mother and your sisters.

1455
01:26:12,520 --> 01:26:16,032
But when he told me about
your father and the railroad,

1456
01:26:17,940 --> 01:26:19,440
that's what I knew it was you.

1457
01:26:21,300 --> 01:26:23,600
- And you chose to stay away from me?

1458
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,340
- I chose to do what you wanted.

1459
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:30,717
Four and a half years ago you told me

1460
01:26:30,717 --> 01:26:35,510
that you didn't want me, that
you wanted to stay with him.

1461
01:26:35,510 --> 01:26:37,639
- Mom, I was protecting you.

1462
01:26:37,639 --> 01:26:39,353
Couldn't you tell?

1463
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:43,170
- You told everyone I was dead.

1464
01:26:43,170 --> 01:26:44,620
- I was told you passed away,

1465
01:26:45,690 --> 01:26:47,750
and the girls were adopted out.

1466
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:50,700
And then I went to
Charlottesville and I saw them.

1467
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:52,173
It all made sense.

1468
01:26:56,010 --> 01:26:58,723
Wait, do you know about the girls?

1469
01:26:59,900 --> 01:27:03,563
- I know them, but they don't know me.

1470
01:27:04,972 --> 01:27:07,090
The pastor and his wife
bringing them around

1471
01:27:07,090 --> 01:27:08,793
once a month for me to see them.

1472
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:12,100
They're very well cared for.

1473
01:27:14,870 --> 01:27:15,833
- It really is you.

1474
01:27:19,860 --> 01:27:21,360
- So, you don't hate me?

1475
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,960
- No, Mama.

1476
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,053
When I escaped I came looking for you.

1477
01:27:38,610 --> 01:27:40,840
- Did he hurt you?

1478
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,957
- You don't wanna know that, Mama.

1479
01:27:42,957 --> 01:27:46,290
I'm alive, I'm here, we have each other.

1480
01:27:50,895 --> 01:27:54,228
(Clara whimpers softly)

1481
01:27:57,540 --> 01:27:59,423
- You've done very well with yourself.

1482
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:01,527
You know, Mr. Wells,

1483
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:04,749
he told me all about
that boy that you saved.

1484
01:28:04,749 --> 01:28:08,063
And some other things too.

1485
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:10,003
- Other things?

1486
01:28:12,043 --> 01:28:13,773
- He told me about her.

1487
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:16,730
- Elizabeth.

1488
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:17,563
- I've seen her.

1489
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:19,610
She's very beautiful.

1490
01:28:24,263 --> 01:28:25,903
Do you love her?

1491
01:28:25,903 --> 01:28:28,178
- I do.

1492
01:28:28,178 --> 01:28:29,844
- When you're ready,

1493
01:28:39,068 --> 01:28:41,596
I want you to give her this.

1494
01:28:41,596 --> 01:28:44,773
- No, Mama, this is the ring from daddy.

1495
01:28:44,773 --> 01:28:47,980
- I'd rather give it to
somebody who is in love

1496
01:28:47,980 --> 01:28:52,980
than keep it as a reminder
of the love that I have lost.

1497
01:28:53,236 --> 01:28:54,236
- Thank you.

1498
01:28:55,293 --> 01:28:58,900
When the time is right,
I will let you know.

1499
01:29:05,293 --> 01:29:07,920
I guess I better get going.

1500
01:29:07,920 --> 01:29:09,120
Lot of explaining to do.

1501
01:29:10,312 --> 01:29:11,733
A lot to talk to Beth about.

1502
01:29:17,517 --> 01:29:20,100
(floor creaks)

1503
01:29:22,723 --> 01:29:24,520
Can you stay?

1504
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:25,452
Please, come home.

1505
01:29:27,050 --> 01:29:28,150
- You want me to stay?

1506
01:29:29,139 --> 01:29:30,743
- I'll figure this out.

1507
01:29:30,743 --> 01:29:31,743
You're safe.

1508
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:43,820
This is the best day of my life.

1509
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:44,713
I'm finally home.

1510
01:29:49,907 --> 01:29:52,324
(shoes thud)

1511
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:58,960
- Theo!

1512
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:00,313
Thank God.

1513
01:30:00,313 --> 01:30:02,850
You have never been this late.

1514
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:05,350
We really need to get a phone
installed in that house.

1515
01:30:05,350 --> 01:30:06,760
I was worried sick.

1516
01:30:06,760 --> 01:30:08,389
- Listen, there's something
I need to talk to you about.

1517
01:30:08,389 --> 01:30:09,639
- There you are.

1518
01:30:09,639 --> 01:30:12,066
You know, I was just bragging
on you for your punctuality.

1519
01:30:12,066 --> 01:30:14,261
- Mr. Wells, look, I'm sorry.

1520
01:30:14,261 --> 01:30:15,563
- Well, hell!

1521
01:30:16,400 --> 01:30:18,188
Is that what I think it is?

1522
01:30:18,188 --> 01:30:21,088
- Theo, you said you needed
to talk to me about something?

1523
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:27,620
- This isn't exactly how I planned this.

1524
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:29,309
- Never is, son.

1525
01:30:29,309 --> 01:30:31,440
Come on, what are you waiting for?

1526
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,023
The tea is getting cold.

1527
01:30:36,170 --> 01:30:41,170
- Ms. Elizabeth Smallwood,
would you do me the honor?

1528
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:43,280
- Yes, Theodore Rogers.

1529
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:44,761
I accept your offer of marriage.

1530
01:30:44,761 --> 01:30:45,733
- Woo, hot damn!

1531
01:30:45,733 --> 01:30:47,719
This is a cause for celebration.

1532
01:30:47,719 --> 01:30:49,550
What do you say we gather
all the folks tonight

1533
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,452
in the Lewis and Clark ballroom.

1534
01:30:51,452 --> 01:30:53,743
I'll get Della to whip up a feast.

1535
01:30:53,743 --> 01:30:55,530
We'll have music and dancing

1536
01:30:55,530 --> 01:30:58,120
and celebrate your announcement in style!

1537
01:30:58,120 --> 01:30:59,059
- Tonight, sir?

1538
01:30:59,059 --> 01:31:00,500
- No time like the present.

1539
01:31:00,500 --> 01:31:01,610
- Thank you, sir.

1540
01:31:01,610 --> 01:31:03,162
I'm sure Pa would love to help as well.

1541
01:31:03,162 --> 01:31:06,000
- Now, don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

1542
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,330
Now, go on, get gussied up.

1543
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:08,200
We'll see you tonight.

1544
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:09,410
- Yes, sir.

1545
01:31:09,410 --> 01:31:10,243
I love you.

1546
01:31:12,151 --> 01:31:14,568
(lips smack)

1547
01:31:16,480 --> 01:31:17,870
- That is one happy lady.

1548
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:19,600
You did good, son.

1549
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,450
- Thank you, sir.

1550
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:22,740
- Now, come on, we gotta
get you cleaned up too.

1551
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:24,136
We got a party to plan.

1552
01:31:24,136 --> 01:31:27,710
(vibrant fiddle music)

1553
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:32,710
(guests clap)
(guests cheer)

1554
01:31:43,264 --> 01:31:45,373
You're getting a fine
young man for a son-in-law.

1555
01:31:45,373 --> 01:31:47,540
- I don't know, Clarence.

1556
01:31:47,540 --> 01:31:48,949
Sure don't know much about him.

1557
01:31:48,949 --> 01:31:50,410
- What more is there to know?

1558
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:52,309
He's a hero, he's a damn good worker,

1559
01:31:52,309 --> 01:31:54,240
and he's head over
heels for your daughter.

1560
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,073
He'll be good to her.

1561
01:31:55,073 --> 01:31:57,570
- You don't know anything
about his family?

1562
01:31:57,570 --> 01:31:58,879
What he comes from?

1563
01:31:58,879 --> 01:32:02,030
They could be a family of
convicts for all we know.

1564
01:32:02,030 --> 01:32:04,620
- I assure you that
young man has character.

1565
01:32:04,620 --> 01:32:06,330
There's not an evil bone in his body.

1566
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:07,473
I'll vouch for him.

1567
01:32:07,473 --> 01:32:09,232
- Is that right?

1568
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:12,960
- Closest thing to a son I'll ever have.

1569
01:32:12,960 --> 01:32:15,580
(vibrant fiddle music)

1570
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:20,580
(guests clap)
(guests cheer)

1571
01:32:30,480 --> 01:32:31,957
- Thank y'all so much,
I sure appreciate it.

1572
01:32:31,957 --> 01:32:33,514
We're gonna take a short break.

1573
01:32:33,514 --> 01:32:35,780
Y'all can come on up and grab some grub,

1574
01:32:35,780 --> 01:32:39,392
and don't forget to
congratulate the happy couple.

1575
01:32:39,392 --> 01:32:41,975
(guests cheer)

1576
01:32:52,494 --> 01:32:54,911
(door thuds)

1577
01:32:59,389 --> 01:33:00,823
- You look beautiful.

1578
01:33:00,823 --> 01:33:03,576
- Thank you, it was my mother's.

1579
01:33:03,576 --> 01:33:06,200
(spoon taps)

1580
01:33:06,200 --> 01:33:09,164
- Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight is a great night!

1581
01:33:09,164 --> 01:33:13,430
We're all united in support
of this fine young couple.

1582
01:33:13,430 --> 01:33:16,180
(crickets chirp)

1583
01:33:19,612 --> 01:33:22,029
(shoes thud)

1584
01:33:23,850 --> 01:33:24,683
- Evening.

1585
01:33:25,889 --> 01:33:27,853
Where are you going all gussied up?

1586
01:33:29,269 --> 01:33:31,171
- We were just celebrating Mr. Smallwood's

1587
01:33:31,171 --> 01:33:32,621
daughter's engagement.

1588
01:33:32,621 --> 01:33:36,583
- And you decided to stand
out here on the streets alone?

1589
01:33:38,010 --> 01:33:39,260
You looking for somebody?

1590
01:33:42,290 --> 01:33:44,280
- I'm gonna have to ask
you to leave her alone.

1591
01:33:44,280 --> 01:33:46,243
I'll be the one taking her home tonight.

1592
01:33:47,096 --> 01:33:49,532
If you're looking for
the party, it's inside,

1593
01:33:49,532 --> 01:33:52,040
but you're gonna have to leave her alone.

1594
01:33:52,040 --> 01:33:53,844
- Engagement party, huh?

1595
01:33:53,844 --> 01:33:55,469
Who's the lucky fellow who's gonna

1596
01:33:55,469 --> 01:33:57,309
roll into all that money?

1597
01:33:57,309 --> 01:33:59,950
- He's not from here,
you wouldn't know him.

1598
01:33:59,950 --> 01:34:00,782
None of us do.

1599
01:34:02,118 --> 01:34:04,433
His name is Theodore Rogers.

1600
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,700
- Theodore Rogers, you're
like the son I never had.

1601
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:11,900
And for an engagement gift,

1602
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:15,750
I'm offering you a permanent
position at the mill.

1603
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,760
Son, I'm offering you a foreman job.

1604
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:20,036
Will you accept?

1605
01:34:20,036 --> 01:34:21,606
- Yes, sir, thank you, sir.

1606
01:34:21,606 --> 01:34:22,870
- All right.

1607
01:34:22,870 --> 01:34:27,279
(guests applaud)
- Thank you, thank you.

1608
01:34:27,279 --> 01:34:30,279
(hands clap slowly)

1609
01:34:33,070 --> 01:34:34,073
- Hip hip hooray.

1610
01:34:35,389 --> 01:34:37,860
Let's all give it up for the happy couple.

1611
01:34:37,860 --> 01:34:39,487
- Who in the hell are you?

1612
01:34:39,487 --> 01:34:41,043
- You're supposed to be dead.

1613
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:45,019
- Mister, I don't know your
name or where you're from,

1614
01:34:45,019 --> 01:34:47,760
but we don't want any trouble around here.

1615
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,719
So, why don't you get the hell outta here?

1616
01:34:49,719 --> 01:34:51,053
- You don't know my name.

1617
01:34:52,410 --> 01:34:53,693
You don't know my name.

1618
01:34:54,693 --> 01:34:57,870
Well, why don't you just
ask the groom to be here?

1619
01:34:57,870 --> 01:34:59,070
Ain't that right, Teddy?

1620
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,513
- What's he talking about?

1621
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:03,563
Theo?

1622
01:35:03,563 --> 01:35:04,563
- Theo?

1623
01:35:05,644 --> 01:35:09,553
(laughs) Who the hell is Theo?

1624
01:35:10,513 --> 01:35:13,963
Oh, he's got you all fooled.

1625
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:16,883
You don't even know who you're marrying.

1626
01:35:16,883 --> 01:35:18,913
(laughs) Don't that beat all.

1627
01:35:19,809 --> 01:35:23,323
Lady, you're standing next to a murderer.

1628
01:35:24,460 --> 01:35:25,920
Go ahead.

1629
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:28,987
Ask him, ask him if
he's ever killed anyone.

1630
01:35:28,987 --> 01:35:30,969
- What's he saying?

1631
01:35:30,969 --> 01:35:31,803
Is it true?

1632
01:35:35,254 --> 01:35:36,393
- I can explain.

1633
01:35:37,436 --> 01:35:38,719
It was an accident.

1634
01:35:38,719 --> 01:35:40,139
- You lied to me.

1635
01:35:40,139 --> 01:35:40,973
- I would...
- How could you?

1636
01:35:40,973 --> 01:35:42,350
- I would never lie to you.

1637
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:43,553
(shoes thud)

1638
01:35:43,553 --> 01:35:44,386
Mr. Wells, I swear to you.

1639
01:35:44,386 --> 01:35:46,160
I was just a child, okay?

1640
01:35:46,160 --> 01:35:48,350
I was playing.

1641
01:35:48,350 --> 01:35:51,123
- Son, I'm the least of
your worries, now go.

1642
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:53,693
- That's right.

1643
01:35:54,550 --> 01:35:55,782
You run, you coward!

1644
01:35:56,770 --> 01:35:59,219
You run just like you did
when you killed my boy!

1645
01:36:01,530 --> 01:36:05,580
My Willy was drug all across that farm,

1646
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:08,443
cut all to pieces and dismembered.

1647
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:11,043
From your hands!

1648
01:36:13,450 --> 01:36:14,282
- Mister.

1649
01:36:15,309 --> 01:36:16,143
- It's not true.

1650
01:36:22,614 --> 01:36:24,809
- Beth, please, stop.

1651
01:36:24,809 --> 01:36:25,643
Let me explain.

1652
01:36:25,643 --> 01:36:27,230
- Explain what?

1653
01:36:27,230 --> 01:36:30,290
That your name is really Teddy,
that you murdered someone?

1654
01:36:30,290 --> 01:36:32,110
- I told you, my mother called me Teddy.

1655
01:36:32,110 --> 01:36:33,710
- Oh, thank you for that.

1656
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:34,543
You just left out the part

1657
01:36:34,543 --> 01:36:36,624
about killing another human being.

1658
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:40,240
Damn it, Theo, I told my
father you were a good person.

1659
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:41,630
I am so ashamed.

1660
01:36:41,630 --> 01:36:42,960
- Will you just listen to me?

1661
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:45,070
- How could you embarrass me like that?

1662
01:36:45,070 --> 01:36:47,410
How would you embarrass my entire family?

1663
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:48,620
I could never marry a liar,

1664
01:36:48,620 --> 01:36:50,410
let alone someone who
killed another person.

1665
01:36:50,410 --> 01:36:52,719
- Damn it, will you just let me explain?

1666
01:36:52,719 --> 01:36:53,553
- I can't.

1667
01:36:54,630 --> 01:36:56,930
- If you've ever loved
me for even a second,

1668
01:36:56,930 --> 01:36:57,990
you will let me explain.

1669
01:36:57,990 --> 01:36:59,713
I will tell you everything.

1670
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,383
- Where are you taking me?

1671
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:20,840
- Little Willy Stamper.

1672
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,570
You're Buck Stamper, right?

1673
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:26,680
- Who wants to know?
- My Pa was there.

1674
01:37:26,680 --> 01:37:29,143
He's the one who found Willy,
you can ask the sheriff.

1675
01:37:30,630 --> 01:37:31,463
- See?

1676
01:37:33,700 --> 01:37:34,969
Now you all know

1677
01:37:37,035 --> 01:37:38,763
that boy killed my son.

1678
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:43,590
- It seems you and I
remember this differently.

1679
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:45,509
They were two kids doing something

1680
01:37:45,509 --> 01:37:47,190
they shouldn't have been doing, yes.

1681
01:37:47,190 --> 01:37:49,112
It was an accident.

1682
01:37:50,536 --> 01:37:54,159
That's why no charges were
ever leveled against that boy.

1683
01:37:54,159 --> 01:37:57,130
They were playing with
your gun, Mr. Stamper,

1684
01:37:57,130 --> 01:37:58,730
before they got on that tractor.

1685
01:37:59,670 --> 01:38:00,830
If you'd been a better father,

1686
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:02,330
your son would be alive today.

1687
01:38:03,750 --> 01:38:06,660
That boy, he ran to get help.

1688
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:10,233
He tried to get his Mama to save Willy.

1689
01:38:11,370 --> 01:38:12,719
He never left him to die alone.

1690
01:38:12,719 --> 01:38:17,323
He left him to save his
life, and that's the truth.

1691
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:22,750
(somber music)

1692
01:38:25,030 --> 01:38:27,157
- You're not welcome here.

1693
01:38:27,157 --> 01:38:30,487
Now get the hell out of
Maysville before we run you out.

1694
01:38:41,046 --> 01:38:43,463
(shoes thud)

1695
01:38:48,110 --> 01:38:50,527
(motor hums)

1696
01:38:52,289 --> 01:38:54,956
(tires screech)

1697
01:39:06,282 --> 01:39:09,032
(car door slams)

1698
01:39:12,910 --> 01:39:17,077
- Elizabeth, when I was a child, 13,

1699
01:39:19,410 --> 01:39:21,180
I was with my best friend, Willy.

1700
01:39:21,180 --> 01:39:23,713
We were playing bandits
with his daddy's gun.

1701
01:39:25,570 --> 01:39:28,910
Beth, the bullets ran out.

1702
01:39:28,910 --> 01:39:30,389
We went to your grandpa's farm.

1703
01:39:30,389 --> 01:39:32,090
- To steal his tractor, I know the story.

1704
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:32,923
- No.

1705
01:39:32,923 --> 01:39:36,213
Because we wanted to be grownups
and drive the damn thing.

1706
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,323
That's when things went terribly wrong.

1707
01:39:42,730 --> 01:39:46,343
Willy fell, and I couldn't make it stop.

1708
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:52,850
- Who the hell are you?

1709
01:39:54,559 --> 01:39:56,664
- Everything he's saying is true.

1710
01:39:56,664 --> 01:39:58,313
- What is going on here?

1711
01:40:01,050 --> 01:40:05,263
- Beth, this is my mother.

1712
01:40:06,530 --> 01:40:09,202
- Oh, great.

1713
01:40:10,250 --> 01:40:11,425
More lies.

1714
01:40:11,425 --> 01:40:12,960
What's next, Theo?

1715
01:40:12,960 --> 01:40:16,420
Is your dead father going to
walk out of the chicken coop?

1716
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,960
What is wrong with you people?

1717
01:40:17,960 --> 01:40:20,490
How long have you been
planning this charade?

1718
01:40:20,490 --> 01:40:24,650
And you have been coming to
the store for over a month now!

1719
01:40:24,650 --> 01:40:26,530
And the whole time you
were just fooling me

1720
01:40:26,530 --> 01:40:30,900
into being some part of
your big master scheme!

1721
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,683
My God, I'm such a fool!

1722
01:40:33,537 --> 01:40:36,190
- No, it's not like that.

1723
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:38,752
Okay, I just escaped a few months ago.

1724
01:40:38,752 --> 01:40:40,170
- [Elizabeth] From who, your mother?

1725
01:40:40,170 --> 01:40:42,083
- No, from the devil himself.

1726
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,889
That man in town today,
he was Willy's father.

1727
01:40:45,889 --> 01:40:47,889
And when he died, I had to take his place

1728
01:40:47,889 --> 01:40:50,163
or he was gonna kill me
and my entire family.

1729
01:40:52,510 --> 01:40:56,580
I survived for four years with pure evil.

1730
01:40:56,580 --> 01:41:00,410
Being yelled at, beaten,
tormented every day of my life.

1731
01:41:00,410 --> 01:41:03,043
And he threatened to hurt
my family if I ever left.

1732
01:41:05,394 --> 01:41:06,693
And then a few months ago,

1733
01:41:08,290 --> 01:41:12,413
I went looking for the girls
and Mama, but they were gone.

1734
01:41:14,207 --> 01:41:16,003
And I went into town and I met you.

1735
01:41:19,356 --> 01:41:20,483
And I still see him.

1736
01:41:22,740 --> 01:41:24,217
Willy stills haunts me.

1737
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:31,240
But he's my best friend, and
I never wanted him to die.

1738
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:32,073
Never.

1739
01:41:33,132 --> 01:41:34,910
- Is this true?

1740
01:41:34,910 --> 01:41:37,493
(solemn music)

1741
01:42:19,728 --> 01:42:21,896
You did this to save them?

1742
01:42:33,843 --> 01:42:36,260
(motor hums)

1743
01:42:43,070 --> 01:42:44,543
- Well, ain't that sweet.

1744
01:42:45,889 --> 01:42:48,910
Got ourselves a real family reunion here.

1745
01:42:48,910 --> 01:42:50,510
You showing her your scars, boy?

1746
01:42:51,398 --> 01:42:52,713
I did you a favor.

1747
01:42:53,620 --> 01:42:56,389
You spare the rod, you spoil the child.

1748
01:42:56,389 --> 01:42:57,637
I made a man outta you.

1749
01:43:00,364 --> 01:43:01,380
You look different.

1750
01:43:01,380 --> 01:43:02,280
- Leave her alone.

1751
01:43:03,892 --> 01:43:05,633
- I can still see you clearly.

1752
01:43:06,570 --> 01:43:08,820
- Seems our little
agreement didn't suit you.

1753
01:43:09,861 --> 01:43:12,639
You left, not before
causing me to lose my barn.

1754
01:43:12,639 --> 01:43:14,090
- You tried to kill me.

1755
01:43:14,090 --> 01:43:15,013
- Deal's off.

1756
01:43:16,987 --> 01:43:18,383
Back to square one.

1757
01:43:19,550 --> 01:43:20,830
- So this is never gonna end?

1758
01:43:20,830 --> 01:43:22,020
- This is my family now,

1759
01:43:22,020 --> 01:43:23,050
and you are messing with the wrong...

1760
01:43:23,050 --> 01:43:25,240
- You better mind your little lady.

1761
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:27,293
You don't want her getting hurt.

1762
01:43:27,293 --> 01:43:29,893
You're not gonna hurt her or anybody.

1763
01:43:30,770 --> 01:43:33,250
I've paid any debt I had to you.

1764
01:43:33,250 --> 01:43:34,452
I owe you nothing.

1765
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:37,123
- That's not the deal.

1766
01:43:38,100 --> 01:43:41,200
An eye for an eye, a life for a life.

1767
01:43:41,200 --> 01:43:43,250
- Your reign of terror ends here, Mister.

1768
01:43:43,250 --> 01:43:44,460
Do you have any idea who I am?

1769
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,530
I could have my daddy on you...

1770
01:43:45,530 --> 01:43:48,520
- Your Daddy can't help
you right here right now.

1771
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:49,820
This gets settled tonight.

1772
01:43:53,520 --> 01:43:54,960
- Then take me.

1773
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:55,923
- No, Mama.

1774
01:43:58,011 --> 01:43:59,833
- If you have me, I'll go with you.

1775
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:01,973
I'll take his place.

1776
01:44:04,527 --> 01:44:06,277
- Well, ain't that a twist of fate.

1777
01:44:07,483 --> 01:44:08,880
Your Mama done saved you boy.

1778
01:44:08,880 --> 01:44:10,762
- I'll kill you.
- Teddy!

1779
01:44:10,762 --> 01:44:12,550
I love you and I can never repay you

1780
01:44:12,550 --> 01:44:14,020
for what you did for me and the girls.

1781
01:44:14,020 --> 01:44:16,620
But right now I need you to
put her in that car and go!

1782
01:44:16,620 --> 01:44:17,452
Go!

1783
01:44:18,730 --> 01:44:20,600
- [Buck] You best listen
to your Mama, boy.

1784
01:44:20,600 --> 01:44:22,210
- I love you, I'll be back for you.

1785
01:44:22,210 --> 01:44:23,043
- [Clara] Go!

1786
01:44:23,043 --> 01:44:25,503
- Stay strong, I'll have my
Daddy get you before sunrise!

1787
01:44:33,270 --> 01:44:34,469
- It's might chilly out.

1788
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:37,550
Would you mind if I got my shawl?

1789
01:44:37,550 --> 01:44:40,003
It would make the ride more comfortable.

1790
01:44:45,025 --> 01:44:47,608
(solemn music)

1791
01:44:50,969 --> 01:44:54,150
- Kind of ironic, don't you think?

1792
01:44:54,150 --> 01:44:55,807
I ended up with you after all.

1793
01:44:58,431 --> 01:45:01,014
(solemn music)

1794
01:45:14,719 --> 01:45:17,137
(motor hums)

1795
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,127
- We need to get straight to the sheriff.

1796
01:45:22,127 --> 01:45:24,306
- No, he won't help, I
just need to get you safe.

1797
01:45:24,306 --> 01:45:26,889
(gunshot pops)

1798
01:45:31,800 --> 01:45:33,240
Did you hear that?

1799
01:45:33,240 --> 01:45:34,702
- Gunshot.

1800
01:45:34,702 --> 01:45:36,339
Go.

1801
01:45:36,339 --> 01:45:39,339
(suspenseful music)

1802
01:45:55,443 --> 01:45:57,117
(Elizabeth gasps)

1803
01:45:57,117 --> 01:46:00,019
(Clara cries)

1804
01:46:00,019 --> 01:46:01,000
- Hey, Mama, hey.

1805
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:01,833
You all right?

1806
01:46:01,833 --> 01:46:03,853
- I don't know, I don't know!

1807
01:46:03,853 --> 01:46:06,273
We were arguing and he was...

1808
01:46:06,273 --> 01:46:11,273
I went to get my shawl. (cries)

1809
01:46:13,610 --> 01:46:15,277
Theo, what do we do?

1810
01:46:22,438 --> 01:46:24,188
What do we do, Teddy?

1811
01:46:27,893 --> 01:46:30,226
- We get you somewhere safe.

1812
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,862
(gentle music)

1813
01:46:34,862 --> 01:46:38,133
Elizabeth, you take her to safety.

1814
01:46:38,133 --> 01:46:38,966
- Okay.

1815
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:43,853
Theo, are you coming with us?

1816
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:52,389
Theo, are you coming with us?

1817
01:46:52,389 --> 01:46:55,260
- No, I've gotta stay with the body.

1818
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:57,309
Send the sheriff, I'll take it from here.

1819
01:46:58,748 --> 01:47:01,055
It's all over now.

1820
01:47:01,055 --> 01:47:03,638
(solemn music)

1821
01:47:10,930 --> 01:47:11,763
Go.

1822
01:47:12,646 --> 01:47:15,146
(engine revs)

1823
01:47:20,680 --> 01:47:22,452
There are secrets in the mountains,

1824
01:47:23,503 --> 01:47:26,032
and sometimes secrets are covered by lies.

1825
01:47:27,180 --> 01:47:29,480
I know my Mama killed
Buck Stamper that night,

1826
01:47:30,454 --> 01:47:33,139
a secret I hold to this day.

1827
01:47:33,139 --> 01:47:35,250
But it wasn't until years later

1828
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,740
she finally told me the truth.

1829
01:47:36,740 --> 01:47:39,623
(Clara groans)

1830
01:47:39,623 --> 01:47:42,138
- You got this, okay.

1831
01:47:42,138 --> 01:47:44,496
(Clara groans)

1832
01:47:44,496 --> 01:47:45,968
I can see the head.

1833
01:47:45,968 --> 01:47:48,718
(Clara whimpers)

1834
01:47:53,271 --> 01:47:54,493
(baby coos)

1835
01:47:54,493 --> 01:47:55,410
It's a boy.

1836
01:47:56,980 --> 01:47:57,813
William.

1837
01:47:58,971 --> 01:47:59,804
Little William.

1838
01:48:04,766 --> 01:48:06,407
He can't stay here.

1839
01:48:06,407 --> 01:48:08,639
- [Teddy] The truth was always there.

1840
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:10,010
- John will now.

1841
01:48:10,010 --> 01:48:13,320
- [Teddy] I guess we just
choose to see what we wanna see.

1842
01:48:13,320 --> 01:48:15,219
- Think it might be all that drinkin'.

1843
01:48:16,503 --> 01:48:20,473
First the war, then Mama left him.

1844
01:48:22,260 --> 01:48:23,643
You lucky you don't have a daddy.

1845
01:48:24,799 --> 01:48:27,299
(tense music)

1846
01:48:28,318 --> 01:48:30,902
(solemn music)

1847
01:48:32,520 --> 01:48:34,653
- [Young Teddy] She lost
her husband and her baby.

1848
01:48:34,653 --> 01:48:36,760
Maybe we can cut her some slack.

1849
01:48:36,760 --> 01:48:38,639
- I don't know what I'm
gonna do with you boys.

1850
01:48:38,639 --> 01:48:41,133
You know this can get infected.

1851
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:45,507
- [Buck] Look at him, look at him!

1852
01:48:47,731 --> 01:48:49,573
- My Teddy loved him too.

1853
01:48:51,620 --> 01:48:52,793
I loved him.

1854
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,603
You aren't the only one mourning here.

1855
01:48:56,603 --> 01:48:58,173
- You didn't love Willy.

1856
01:48:59,752 --> 01:49:01,788
He was mine.

1857
01:49:01,788 --> 01:49:04,371
(solemn music)

1858
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:16,389
You gonna tell him or should I?

1859
01:49:17,225 --> 01:49:18,525
He killed his own brother.

1860
01:49:20,231 --> 01:49:23,172
(gunshot blasts)

1861
01:49:23,172 --> 01:49:25,672
(birds chirp)

1862
01:49:27,704 --> 01:49:30,287
(solemn music)

1863
01:49:39,501 --> 01:49:41,918
- You can't haunt me anymore.

1864
01:49:44,014 --> 01:49:46,597
(gentle music)

1865
01:49:55,991 --> 01:49:58,978
- [Willy VOICEOVER] Now, we
are full-on blood brothers.

1866
01:49:58,978 --> 01:50:00,813
Can't nobody ever take us apart.

1867
01:50:02,375 --> 01:50:04,958
(gentle music)

1868
01:50:10,657 --> 01:50:12,575
- Rest in peace, Willy.

1869
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:19,680
(majestic music)

1870
01:50:42,606 --> 01:50:45,189
(gentle music)
