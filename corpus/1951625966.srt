You told the whole city.

176
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:51,286
Oome on, I didn't
mention your name.

177
00:10:51,354 --> 00:10:54,187
You didn't have to.
Everyone I know
has been calling me.

178
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,688
Would you talk to me?!

179
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:04,790
I made a mistake.

180
00:11:05,868 --> 00:11:09,702
And I feel horrible, I do.
But you said so yourself...

181
00:11:09,772 --> 00:11:11,569
your virginity's
not a major thing.

182
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,871
It's not.
It's a minor thing.

183
00:11:13,943 --> 00:11:15,968
But it's
my minor thing.

184
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:17,444
I was just tellin'
my camera guy.

185
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:19,140
You gotta admit,
it's a little unusual.

186
00:11:19,215 --> 00:11:21,445
What? I just
never did it with anyone,

187
00:11:21,517 --> 00:11:23,007
It's not like I didn't try.

188
00:11:23,085 --> 00:11:27,454
So you're saying
the effort was there,
you just lacked the aptitude?

189
00:11:29,325 --> 00:11:31,520
It just hasn't
worked out. U h...

190
00:11:31,594 --> 00:11:37,328
I'd be with a guy and
we'd be headed that way,
and... stuff would happen.

191
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,526
"Stuff"?

192
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:39,966
Stuff.

193
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,596
Like his ex-girlfriend
would come back from Ohina.

194
00:11:42,672 --> 00:11:45,334
Or he'd have a court date,
and I'd never see him again.

195
00:11:45,408 --> 00:11:47,603
Or... I'd get
the chicken pox.

196
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:50,145
You're supposed to
get chicken pox when
you're a kid,

197
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:52,738
but I would get them
when I tried to sleep
with someone.

198
00:11:56,919 --> 00:12:00,685
Anyway, I was just hoping
you'd be a little more careful
with the information.

199
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:02,883
I know, I know.

200
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:07,629
What do you wanna do?
You wanna break up
over this?

201
00:12:09,932 --> 00:12:11,559
No. Do you?

202
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:12,931
No.

203
00:12:14,971 --> 00:12:18,805
So, come on, relax.
We'll order a pizza.

204
00:12:20,543 --> 00:12:21,703
I'm not hungry.

205
00:12:41,964 --> 00:12:43,659
What are you doing?

206
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:50,734
I wanna
make love with you.
What's wrong with that?

207
00:12:52,275 --> 00:12:53,799
Nothing.

208
00:12:53,876 --> 00:12:56,344
It can be the lead story
at 11: 00

209
00:13:09,492 --> 00:13:11,687
How humiliating.

210
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:14,059
It's okay.
I'm fine.

211
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,893
You must wanna
kill yourself.

212
00:13:15,965 --> 00:13:18,229
Or someone else.
Seen this?

213
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:24,132
"Our favorite reporter,
Tom Lindeman, told everyone...
and I mean everyone...

214
00:13:24,206 --> 00:13:25,798
that his girlfriend's a..."

215
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,775
Oh, my God!

216
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:30,573
"Whoever she is,
let's hope she doesn't
hold a grudge."

217
00:13:30,646 --> 00:13:31,635
Hold one.

218
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:32,703
You have to get even.

219
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:34,306
For women
everywhere.

220
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:38,843
You know what really gets me,
is that technically he never
really apologized.

221
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:40,388
You broke up
with him, right?

222
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:43,391
Of course she
broke up with him.
She's not stupid.

223
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:48,363
Excuse me.

224
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:50,797
Oan you tell me
where this is at
right here?

225
00:13:52,134 --> 00:13:54,102
You're lost.
You're not even close.

226
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:56,263
Sweet.

227
00:13:56,339 --> 00:14:00,537
Well, since I'm here,
can I get, uh, can I get, uh,
some French Sumatra please?

228
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:01,736
Whole beans.

229
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,372
Okay.

230
00:14:05,448 --> 00:14:08,042
You don't break up with
someone when you've
been brought together

231
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,642
by something as powerful
as the triple-sneeze incident.

232
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,948
The what?

233
00:14:12,021 --> 00:14:13,750
The triple-sneeze.
How I met Tom.

234
00:14:13,823 --> 00:14:15,154
You crashed into his car.

235
00:14:15,224 --> 00:14:19,854
But it was a meaningful crash.
I was driving along,
and I sneezed three times,

236
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:21,089
and then I hit him.

237
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,960
Yeah. You should hit him now.

238
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:26,559
I've never sneezed three times
before in my life. I've never been
in a car accident.

239
00:14:26,636 --> 00:14:30,663
And I didn't hit the fat
weather guy from Channel 10,
I hit the dreamy reporter,

240
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,038
the guy I was fantasizing
about all that time

241
00:14:33,109 --> 00:14:35,100
when I was trying
to get over Oharlie.

242
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:37,941
I mean, things like that
just aren't coincidence.

243
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:41,472
(Jeana)
You bump into a guy like that,
and it means something.

244
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:43,609
- Oh, sorry!
- I'm so sorry!

245
00:14:43,686 --> 00:14:45,449
I'll get it.
She pushed me.

246
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:46,715
It's okay, it's okay.

247
00:14:46,789 --> 00:14:49,053
I'm... I'm really
not that clumsy.

248
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,922
Oh! Ooh!

249
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:53,223
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

250
00:14:53,295 --> 00:14:55,957
Uh... French Sumatra?

251
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:57,192
Yeah, it was.

252
00:14:57,266 --> 00:14:59,063
That's her favorite, too.

253
00:14:59,135 --> 00:15:01,626
He's not... uh, it's not.

254
00:15:03,673 --> 00:15:04,662
My favorite.

255
00:15:11,547 --> 00:15:12,673
Good morning!

256
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,719
(Dave)
She seems so normal.

257
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:21,484
I mean, you know her
better than I.

258
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:23,923
Howcomes
you couldn't tell?

259
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:27,656
Well, gee, I guess I missed
the big "V" stamped
on her forehead.

260
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:31,565
(Jeana)
Whatever you're thinking,
don't say it.

261
00:15:33,636 --> 00:15:37,197
We'll take it nice and slow
since you haven't seen
the software before.

262
00:15:37,273 --> 00:15:40,572
And you haven't seen
the hardware before.

263
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,845
Yeah, Lawrence, that was
a real exciting newscast.

264
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:54,322
Like watching your own
autopsy. Listen, can we
just talk about work?

265
00:15:56,892 --> 00:15:58,621
Oh, forget it!

266
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,397
Animals!

267
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:10,498
Oh, my God! Six hundred
firefighters know my sex life!

268
00:16:10,573 --> 00:16:12,404
Technically,
it's an anti-sex life.

269
00:16:12,475 --> 00:16:14,272
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

270
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:15,776
What?!

271
00:16:15,845 --> 00:16:17,312
You've made my life
a nightmare!

272
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,937
You think mine's
been a joyride?

273
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:21,847
I'm off the anchor list.
I don't even know
why you're upset.

274
00:16:21,917 --> 00:16:23,441
Apparently virginity's "in."

275
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,615
I don't care about what's in!
I care about my private life,
and the fact that you told

276
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,783
a few hundred
thousand people!!

277
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,292
- So you're not going?
- No!!

278
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,486
Fine!

279
00:16:32,561 --> 00:16:33,459
Norma, I need...

280
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:34,621
[laughs]

281
00:16:34,697 --> 00:16:36,289
No, no.
Jeana.

282
00:16:36,365 --> 00:16:37,559
Those aren't
your tickets!

283
00:16:39,135 --> 00:16:40,625
Ha ha!

284
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,295
Ha!

285
00:16:42,371 --> 00:16:44,134
I'm not going.

286
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:46,470
Are you sure,
honey?

287
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,601
Yes. When can I get
my money back?

288
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:52,272
U h, okay...
U h, let's see.

289
00:16:52,882 --> 00:16:56,511
Oh, dear.
Oh, okay.

290
00:16:56,585 --> 00:16:58,780
The cruise departs
13 days from now.

291
00:16:58,854 --> 00:17:01,345
Deadline for refunds
was yesterday.

292
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:04,551
I paid $6, 000
for that ticket.

293
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:08,324
Actually, it was 6, 082.

294
00:17:08,397 --> 00:17:12,527
But you could've gotten it
all back if you would have
had cancellation insurance.

295
00:17:12,601 --> 00:17:15,729
I did! We did. You got
the insurance, right?

296
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:18,330
Well, actually,
it says here that he didn't.

297
00:17:18,407 --> 00:17:21,069
Yeah, I thought I'd
save us a few bucks.
'Oause...

298
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,270
Gimme my ticket,
you oaf!

299
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:24,539
Oh, so now I'm an oaf?

300
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:27,013
Give it! I'm the one
who's been saving
for years!

301
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:29,243
I had this all planned
before we met!

302
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:38,852
I paid you $6, 000
for that ticket!
My half! Uch!

303
00:17:40,329 --> 00:17:46,734
(Norma)
Actually, um,
it was $6, 082.42.

304
00:17:48,671 --> 00:17:50,832
That you would have
been refunded.

305
00:17:52,141 --> 00:17:54,041
If you would have had
the insurance.

306
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:58,712
If he wasn't an oaf.

307
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:03,749
(man)
So you guys
broke up, then?

308
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,252
No.

309
00:18:05,321 --> 00:18:06,788
Why does everyone
assume that?

310
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:08,187
It's just tradition.

311
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:13,126
We'll work it out.
We just need to talk.
Everything'll be fine.

312
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:14,890
Good!

313
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:18,999
[Russian accent]
N ick, look at this.
Oan you believe this?

314
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:21,696
They're calling me
"a local bright spot."

315
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,169
That's great,
Zsa Zsa.

316
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:24,729
"A personality
to watch."

317
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:28,871
And you know
what else?

318
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:31,474
Me and Tom
are back together.

319
00:18:33,515 --> 00:18:36,712
He's taking me on
a Brazilian cruise. It's...

320
00:18:36,785 --> 00:18:37,911
He's what?

321
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:43,391
Oh, Jeana, hello.
You did... you didn't know?
She didn't know.

322
00:18:43,459 --> 00:18:49,921
That is so like Tom.
I can't believe this.
I mean... Isn't he funny?

323
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:12,013
Oh, look. Tom's twin.

324
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:15,315
The cruise tickets.
Let's find them.

325
00:19:15,391 --> 00:19:20,226
We should break something.
Oome on, it'd be good therapy.

326
00:19:22,998 --> 00:19:24,260
No.

327
00:19:26,035 --> 00:19:27,627
[Crash]

328
00:19:27,703 --> 00:19:29,170
(Tom)
Does daddy
like mommy?

329
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,796
I think daddy
likes mommy a lot.

330
00:19:30,873 --> 00:19:34,104
Where'd mommy go?
Where's mommy going?
Yes!

331
00:19:34,176 --> 00:19:35,507
(Zsa Zsa)
Daddy, don't spank me!

332
00:19:35,577 --> 00:19:37,238
[Spank]
Ay!

333
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:40,872
[Moaning]

334
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:44,380
(Tom)
Aah!

335
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:48,581
Whoa. She's hot.

336
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,962
[Music blaring]

337
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:56,725
(DJ over radio)
Great stuff, huh?

338
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,700
So I've been getting calls
all night about that thing on TV,

339
00:19:59,768 --> 00:20:02,965
Tom Lindeman
telling the whole world
his girlfriend's never had sex.

340
00:20:03,038 --> 00:20:05,233
Turns out this buddy
of mine knows Lindeman,

341
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,673
happens to know that
this girl's name is Jeana.

342

we can find out.

Lindeman.

344
00:20:11,613 --> 00:20:13,945
(DJ)
My name's Tim.
I'm a friend of Jimmy Debbs.

345
00:20:14,016 --> 00:20:15,005
Ha ha, sure.

346
00:20:15,084 --> 00:20:18,713
I work in TVproduction
and Jimmy said maybe you could
get me in the door at Channel 8.

347
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:20,186
I can help you out
with that.

348
00:20:20,255 --> 00:20:21,984
Great, thanks.
Oh, before I forget,

349
00:20:22,057 --> 00:20:25,254
Jimmy said you're dating
this girl I went to college
with, uh, Jeana...

350
00:20:25,327 --> 00:20:27,056
- Yeah, Jeana Summers.
- Ah, that's it.

351
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:28,460
Drive off
a really high cliff.

352
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,021
You went to college with her?
Have I got questions for you.

353
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,089
Why would that be?

354
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:35,159

Twenty-eight new messages.

Hey, Jeana. We met three years
ago at the trade show. What's up?

356
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,429
[Beep]

357
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:42,534
(man)
It's Domination Deluxe.
We provide a valuable service

358
00:20:42,611 --> 00:20:45,876
to men in Northern California,
and we're looking for
a few good vir...

Alison Farmer, host of Channel
Eight's public affairs talk show...

...and I'm thinking,

361
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,087

met the right girl yet.
Come to mama.

(girl talking rapidly)
All my friends look up to you,
and we're all waiting, too,

365
00:20:58,927 --> 00:21:00,588
So you're our hero. I mean,
you should go on Oprah.

366
00:21:00,662 --> 00:21:04,063
And my mom says I should
copy everything you do... the
way you eat and sleep and talk.

367
00:21:04,133 --> 00:21:05,122
So what are you gonna
do right now? I mean...

368
00:21:05,501 --> 00:21:07,332
(man)
Channel 8 News.
May I help you?

369
00:21:15,878 --> 00:21:17,937
He seems so nice
on television.

370
00:21:18,013 --> 00:21:19,810
It's special effects.

371
00:21:19,882 --> 00:21:23,511
Oh. I don't blame you
for not sleeping with him.

372
00:21:23,585 --> 00:21:25,576
Gee, thank you.

373
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:27,781
Neither do the other
ladies in the office.

374
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:32,986
Listen, this trip was supposed
to be the highlight of my life.

375
00:21:33,062 --> 00:21:36,498
It still could be, right?
I mean, I could meet
a guy on the cruise.

376
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:39,633
Oan't we just switch
the reservation?

377
00:21:39,701 --> 00:21:42,397
Well, I'm sorry,
but the policy is strict

378
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:46,532
because the cruise line
can't resell your ticket
when you cancel this late.

379
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:51,045
So basically I need
a boyfriend who'll
betray me sooner.

380
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,876
That would work.

381
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:55,940
And this opportunistic person
can have my ticket?

382
00:21:56,018 --> 00:21:57,883
Yes, I'm afraid so.

383
00:21:57,953 --> 00:22:00,285
He wrote us a check
for the total amount.

384
00:22:00,355 --> 00:22:07,022
But I'd suggest legal action
and have the perfect lawyer
for this.

385
00:22:07,096 --> 00:22:08,927
It's my cousin Maggie.

386
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:11,227
She used to have
a little drug problem,
you know,

387
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:14,269
but she's, like,
all clean and sober now,
she's, like, a a lawyer,

388
00:22:14,336 --> 00:22:17,237
and she's doing great.
She's perfect.
[Clicks her tongue]

389
00:22:17,306 --> 00:22:22,642
Look, you cheating S. O. B,
you talk to my client again,

390
00:22:22,711 --> 00:22:24,474
and I will rip your lungs out!

391
00:22:25,647 --> 00:22:28,980
Sorry. That one kind of
tries my patience.

392
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:32,179
He's cheating on his wife.
Kind of like my husband
cheats on me!

393

[Thud]

394
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:36,657
You know what?
Maybe I should go.

395
00:22:36,725 --> 00:22:42,493
No, no. I'm sorry. Okay,
lemme get a look at you.
H mm, you're pretty.

396
00:22:42,564 --> 00:22:44,225
You sure you're a virgin?

397
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:48,099
Doesn't matter. Okay.
I need you to look hurt.
I need you to look vulnerable.

398
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,365
The jury will hate him.

399
00:22:50,439 --> 00:22:54,466
Eh, God, I was
a virgin once. Didn't take.

400
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,738
You know, a lot of people
think lawyers don't have sex.

401
00:22:57,813 --> 00:23:01,180
But I went to this
lawyer convention,
and let me tell you something:

402
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:06,586
This lady here...
several attorneys. At least
that's what they told me.

403
00:23:08,090 --> 00:23:11,321
Enough about me.
How can I help you?

404
00:23:12,528 --> 00:23:13,893
Oh, th... that's okay.

405
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:16,897
No, no, no. Listen to me.
You deserve me.

406
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:19,763
We are gonna burn this guy!
Okay, let's have a little fun.

407
00:23:19,835 --> 00:23:23,293
Let's put him on the bonfire,
see how high the flame gets.
Who's with me?

408
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,373
She sounds perfect.

409
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:29,638
Yeah, but I can't sue until
he takes someone else,

410
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:33,841
so I'm getting those tickets
back. How do I do it?

411
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,941
Put out a contract on him?

412
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:37,508
Hmm. Too expensive.

413
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:38,883
I'll chip in.

414
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:42,583
Ever notice how your advice
about men always includes
death and destruction?

415
00:23:42,658 --> 00:23:45,218
M mm. A girl can fantasize,
can't she?

417
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:49,727
Oh, I know. J ust fix it
so he doesn't wanna go.

418
00:23:56,972 --> 00:23:59,600
(Jeana)
Hey! Wait up!

419
00:24:03,946 --> 00:24:06,346
He'd give up those tickets
for some big story!

420
00:24:06,415 --> 00:24:12,251
He needs to save his career.
And so I've devised
the Phony Fire District Scandal.

421
00:24:13,088 --> 00:24:15,056
(Jeana)
We make believe
we're doing inspections

422
00:24:15,123 --> 00:24:18,115
of the software companies so
that we can steal the software.

423
00:24:18,193 --> 00:24:20,661
You guys convince him
the evidence is on
our computers.

424
00:24:20,729 --> 00:24:22,959
So that when he comes
to me for the access,

425
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:27,798
I trade him the information
he wants for those tickets.
Both of them.

out of my wallet and hitting
on my best friend.

00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,810
Sixty percent, huh?
I didn't know that.

670
00:37:57,879 --> 00:37:59,676
Maybe 70.

671
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:02,739
Think this thing'll
make it to El Dorado H ills?

672
00:38:02,817 --> 00:38:03,841
I don't know.

673
00:38:03,918 --> 00:38:06,512
I'm new here,
and I don't even know
where El Dorado H ills is.

674
00:38:07,555 --> 00:38:08,852
Let's take my car.

675
00:38:16,397 --> 00:38:21,130
It's just that every guy
that looks at me lately
wants... a date.

676
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:23,170
I wasn't asking
for a date the other day.

677
00:38:23,237 --> 00:38:26,070
As a matter of fact,
I haven't been on a date
in three years.

678
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,129
You're kidding.

679
00:38:27,208 --> 00:38:28,835
Nope.
It's not worth
the trouble.

680
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:30,468
I always run
to the next guy.

681
00:38:30,545 --> 00:38:32,604
Yep. You end up
regretting it, too,
huh?

682
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:36,275
I can tell by the reaction
from the innocent little
frozen dessert the other day

683
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,183
that you've been
through the ringer,
what... three times?

684
00:38:39,253 --> 00:38:40,515
Pretty close.

685
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:44,019
Actually, you nailed it.

686
00:38:44,092 --> 00:38:46,856
I take it
you've been burned
by a woman or two.

687
00:38:46,928 --> 00:38:49,658
Try six.
So don't put it all on men.

688
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:52,665
Six? You're
a slow learner.

689
00:38:53,835 --> 00:38:58,431
Anyway she broke it off
four hours before the wedding.

690
00:38:58,506 --> 00:38:59,700
- No!
- Yeah.

691
00:38:59,774 --> 00:39:02,971
She always did like doing
things at the last minute,
God bless her.

692
00:39:03,044 --> 00:39:04,841
Oh, my God.
So what'd you say to that?

693
00:39:04,912 --> 00:39:07,244
Well, I would call
the bakery where
she worked,

694
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:10,045
and I would disguise my voice,
and I would order pastries.

695
00:39:10,118 --> 00:39:12,780
[Foreign accent]
"Oan I get five pastries?
I need them now."

696
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:13,843
[Laughs]

697
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:17,015
She gained 12 pounds
eatin' the leftovers 'fore
she figured out it was me.

698
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:20,288
Oh, no!
Oh, terrific!

699
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:22,586
Hold it.

700
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:29,126
Okay.

701
00:39:29,203 --> 00:39:30,192
[Camera clicks]

702
00:39:30,271 --> 00:39:32,262
(Paul)
Perfect. Perfect.
There you go.

703
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,308
[Clicks]
Beautiful.

704
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:36,172
# I don't know why #

705
00:39:37,445 --> 00:39:40,073
# You wanna follow me tonight #

706
00:39:41,482 --> 00:39:44,280
# When the rest of the world #

707
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,279
# With whom I've crossed
And I quarreled #

708
00:39:48,356 --> 00:39:50,017
Okay.

709
00:39:50,091 --> 00:39:51,854
# Lets me down so #

710
00:39:53,561 --> 00:39:56,257
# For thousand reasons
That I know #

711
00:39:57,298 --> 00:40:00,734
# To share forever the unrest #

712
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:04,300
# With all the demons
I possess #

713
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,202
# Beneath the silver moon #

714
00:40:08,276 --> 00:40:10,710
I never knew my feet
looked like this.

715
00:40:10,778 --> 00:40:14,305
Yeah, well, it's amazing
what you can see
when you really look, huh?

716
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:18,041
Yeah. It is.

717
00:40:19,287 --> 00:40:23,348
So, I saw you
dancing with that friend
of the bride up there.

718
00:40:23,424 --> 00:40:25,289
Did you get
her number?

719
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,259
Didn't get her name.

720
00:40:27,328 --> 00:40:28,317
She liked you.

721
00:40:28,396 --> 00:40:29,829
I know.

722
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:32,198
Fascinating.

723
00:40:32,967 --> 00:40:35,128
You really gave up
on us, didn't you?

724
00:40:37,505 --> 00:40:39,200
That's right.

725
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:42,533
(Jeana)
This last guy,
we had these moments

726
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:45,170
where it seemed like
everything was possible.

727
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:48,943
It seems to me
that men and women
only really get together

728
00:40:49,016 --> 00:40:51,382
by some great
cosmic accident.

729
00:40:51,452 --> 00:40:53,283
(Paul)
Yeah. A fluke, huh?

730
00:40:53,354 --> 00:40:57,188
My parents are divorced.
My roommate.

731
00:40:57,258 --> 00:41:00,887
I don't know anyone
who has what they want
romance-wise.

732
00:41:02,563 --> 00:41:07,865
Well, this is great, huh?
Sharing each other's
painful experiences?

733
00:41:07,935 --> 00:41:09,869
I'll tell you what.
I'm having a root canal
next week.

734
00:41:09,937 --> 00:41:12,167
I'll give you a call
and tell you the details.

735
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,407
Oheers.

736
00:41:19,213 --> 00:41:21,010
Animal crackers,
fireflies...

737
00:41:21,082 --> 00:41:22,071
Kick the can.

738
00:41:22,149 --> 00:41:24,049
Right! Right! Me, too!
[Laughs]

739
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:27,679
So, um, when
do I get to see
my wedding photos?

740
00:41:27,755 --> 00:41:28,847
Your what?

741
00:41:28,923 --> 00:41:30,686
The photos I took.

742
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:33,454
Oh! The photos you,
uh, yeah, yeah.

743
00:41:33,527 --> 00:41:38,658
I'll tell you what. Here
is my business card.
You just call.

744
00:41:41,135 --> 00:41:42,932
May I?

745
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,130
Yeah.

746
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,474
Oh, wait.

747
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:51,978
My roommate's been
getting these weird calls,
so we changed our number.

748
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:07,117
U h, lemme...

749
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,185
I'll get the door.
Sorry.

750
00:42:15,002 --> 00:42:19,769
Okay. Mary Beth.
Great red hair.
Great smile.

751
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:23,298
Broke your heart in
so many pieces you had
to pick it up with a dustpan!

752
00:42:23,377 --> 00:42:24,401
Remember that?

753
00:42:24,478 --> 00:42:27,003
Why can't I remember that?

754
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:30,476
# But baby I was lonely #

755
00:42:31,852 --> 00:42:33,547
# I don't wanna fight #

756
00:42:33,621 --> 00:42:37,352
So you bumped into him
just as you were saying
how meaningful that could be.

757
00:42:37,425 --> 00:42:41,384
And he reads a lot,
and thinks, and smells good.

758
00:42:41,462 --> 00:42:46,126
And he's got a sexy voice.
So what? He's the enemy, right?

759
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:52,037
Well, we've been
workin' together.

760
00:42:52,106 --> 00:42:56,338
We need to
know each other.
So let's bond.

761
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,775
Enjoy, fellas.

762
00:42:57,845 --> 00:42:59,335
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

763
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,745
H i, guys. Welcome
to Firehouse.

764
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:05,149
My name is J ulie,
and I'll be your waitress.
You're Tom Lindeman.

765
00:43:05,219 --> 00:43:06,584
Yes, I am.

766
00:43:06,654 --> 00:43:09,282
Don't talk to me.
Your waiter
will be right with you.

767
00:43:11,225 --> 00:43:13,386
Did you see that?
A week ago,
women loved me.

768
00:43:13,461 --> 00:43:14,553
[Breathes into his hand]

769
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:16,994
Well, I guess people
can wise up in a week, huh?

770
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:27,066
I don't think it's in me
to be this bitter,
male-bashing person

771
00:43:27,141 --> 00:43:29,575
like that lawyer.
Or you.

772
00:43:29,643 --> 00:43:31,736
I like men.
Not the ones I've met.

773
00:43:32,646 --> 00:43:34,637
You'll be much happier
once you accept

774
00:43:34,715 --> 00:43:38,082
that all the romantic notions
you've had your entire life
are crap.

775
00:43:38,152 --> 00:43:40,916
And the gender
you were counting on
to create your bliss

776
00:43:40,988 --> 00:43:43,388
is really just hot
to get you in bed
and move on.

777
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:47,450
Your divorce is the most
depressing thing that's
ever happened to me.

778
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:52,730
At first, it was
like this... feud?

779
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,360
Yeah, a feud,
'cause I had to win.

780
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:59,304
I had to win. I had to get her
to go on the cruise with me
to save face.

781
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:03,241
But now, I don't know,
I mean, now it's just
kinda like...

782
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,512
You're in love with her.

783
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:07,911
Love? You think?

784
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:11,349
Yeah. I can hear,
I can hear it in your voice,
the way you talk about her.

785
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:13,844
You're right.

786
00:44:13,921 --> 00:44:16,321
I'm in love with her.

787
00:44:16,390 --> 00:44:18,790
'Oause she fries my stuff,
and I should be angry,

788
00:44:18,859 --> 00:44:21,259
but I get, I don't know,
excited and everything,

789
00:44:21,328 --> 00:44:23,091
and I guess I'm thinking
about her.

790
00:44:23,164 --> 00:44:25,598
You gotta tell her. H m?

791
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:30,294
Maybe after she cools off.
I'll give her, say, ten years.

792
00:44:30,371 --> 00:44:33,465
Then there was Kathy,
right? Oh, my...

793
00:44:33,541 --> 00:44:35,702
See, this is what
I'm talking about, right?

794
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:39,678
This woman comes into my life,
and I've forgotten what all
the other ones did to me.

795
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:41,681
So this girl you met,
she a babe or what?

796
00:44:41,749 --> 00:44:46,083
[Chuckles]
You don't divide 'em into
babes a... a... and non-babes.

797
00:44:46,153 --> 00:44:47,848
Yeah? What, then?

798
00:44:47,922 --> 00:44:52,291
I don't know. I mean...
There's "her", and then
there's everybody else.

799
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:53,986
"Her"?

800
00:44:55,162 --> 00:44:56,527
Yeah...

801
00:44:56,597 --> 00:45:00,533
Yeah, but she said she's done
with men. I think that she's
hung up on this guy.

802
00:45:00,601 --> 00:45:03,035
Well, take your shot.
He's probably
some loser.

803
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,503
[Hoof beats approaching]

804
00:45:05,573 --> 00:45:07,063
Why the long face?

805
00:45:11,645 --> 00:45:15,843
[Over answering machine]
Hey there. It's, uh, Paul,
and, uh, this is my voice.

806
00:45:15,916 --> 00:45:19,545
Listen, this gallery in,
in Midtown is showing
my photos,

807
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:24,080
and the opening's Friday night,
and maybe if you're
not doing anything,

808
00:45:24,158 --> 00:45:27,457
you know, or, or, you know,
maybe if you wanna bring
your roommate,

809
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:29,928
and I swear,
I'm not hittin' on her...

810
00:45:29,997 --> 00:45:33,592
It's just, just that I don't know
anyone here and it'd be,
uh, it'd be nice

811
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,362
to have some
people come, so...

812
00:45:35,436 --> 00:45:39,497
Now, let me stress,
this is a, uh, this is
a non-date type of activity.

813
00:45:39,573 --> 00:45:43,065
No dates for anyone.
[Exhales]

814
00:45:43,143 --> 00:45:46,044
Farnham Gallery at, uh,
8:00 P.M., so there you go.

815
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:50,140
Um, talk to you later,
if you want. Bye.

816
00:45:54,855 --> 00:45:56,117
What am I doing?

817
00:46:00,861 --> 00:46:03,955
Well, it would be wrong
not to support the arts.

818
00:46:10,304 --> 00:46:12,499
The woman is diabolical.

819
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:14,507
[Tins bang]

820
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:19,773
This is why you don't trust
women, 'cause they're crazy.

821
00:46:19,847 --> 00:46:21,712
'Oause they hide things
and they're secret.

822
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:22,976
What?

823
00:46:23,050 --> 00:46:24,347
Nothing.

824
00:46:24,418 --> 00:46:26,818
Don't worry. Those tickets
are in a very safe place.

825
00:46:26,887 --> 00:46:28,616
I don't know what
you're talking about.

826
00:46:28,689 --> 00:46:29,883
I got a tip on this story.

827
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:33,324
Firefighter says there's
something fishy going on
in the Fire District.

828
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:35,191
Gonna ride along
with them later today.

829
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:37,059
That's very interesting.
Let's go.

830
00:46:37,131 --> 00:46:38,462
Okay.

831
00:46:40,734 --> 00:46:43,897
(Tom)
My boss won't talk to me.
Women despise me.

832
00:46:43,971 --> 00:46:45,836
I don't know
what's going on any more.

833
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:47,840
I need this story.
I need my pride back.

834
00:46:47,908 --> 00:46:51,503
This'll do it.
Our guys do an inspection
of the software company.

835
00:46:51,579 --> 00:46:55,037
They're in the computer room,
they get the building manager
flustered,

836
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:57,982
he doesn't realize
four guys go in
and only three come out.

837
00:46:58,052 --> 00:47:01,146
So one guy stays back
and then what?

838
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:03,280
He dials out on the modem.
It's so simple.

839
00:47:03,357 --> 00:47:06,622
These places have
all the security to keep
people from getting in,

840
00:47:06,694 --> 00:47:09,458
but there's nothing to prevent
someone from getting out.

841
00:47:09,530 --> 00:47:10,861
So he dials out to...?

842
00:47:10,931 --> 00:47:13,331
The mastermind.

843
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,927
No one sees this guy.
He just pays our guys
to do the job.

844
00:47:17,004 --> 00:47:20,201
Once the connection's made,
he dials out on the modem,

845
00:47:20,274 --> 00:47:22,401
hacking into
the computer system.

846
00:47:22,476 --> 00:47:24,341
Okay.
I gotta see this.

847
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:27,175
No. They see you,
I'm... I'm dead.

848
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:28,839
They won't.

849
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,002
And three come out.
Very smooth.

850
00:47:59,947 --> 00:48:01,175
Whoa!
[Thud]

851
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:08,154
Jeana, look at this.

852
00:48:09,590 --> 00:48:12,081
I just had sex
on my lunch hour.

853
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:14,753
This waiter at Dominick's,
out by the dumpster.

854
00:48:14,828 --> 00:48:16,523
It was so hot.

855
00:48:16,597 --> 00:48:21,034
So I'm not one of you guys
any more. I'm outta the club,
okay?

856
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:25,737
Yeah. Funny you should
say that. Oheck out
the celebrities page.

857
00:48:27,241 --> 00:48:30,768
"Yeah, I had sex
with Jeana Summers.
We were both pretty wasted"?!

858
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:32,175
Who the hell's this?

859
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:35,215
The drummer from
Deadly Barter. Jeana,
this doesn't look good for us.

860
00:48:37,151 --> 00:48:39,881
Get me Alison Farmer.
I'll do her show.

861
00:48:40,621 --> 00:48:42,885
So, basically
you're a romantic?

862
00:48:42,956 --> 00:48:46,289
Was. Now, I'm in recovery.

863
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,294
H m! But you're not
mad at men?

864
00:48:48,362 --> 00:48:52,799
No. I'm mad at God
for making me attracted to men.

865
00:48:52,866 --> 00:48:53,890
[Chuckles]

866
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:57,767
It's just that everyone
looks at you differently when
they discover you're a virgin.

867
00:48:57,838 --> 00:49:00,773
And they have all these weird
opinions about what that means.

868
00:49:00,841 --> 00:49:03,537
When I was in high school,
my virginity was admirable.

869
00:49:03,610 --> 00:49:05,407
When I was in college,
it was "cute".

870
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:08,243
Now that I'm older,
people just find it
incredibly strange.

871
00:49:08,315 --> 00:49:10,840
That's her? That's
your virgin girlfriend?

872
00:49:10,918 --> 00:49:11,942
Shhh! Be quiet!

873
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,008
What do you want?

874
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:14,076
I'm just surprised.

875
00:49:14,154 --> 00:49:15,143
(Tom)
At what?

876
00:49:15,222 --> 00:49:17,452
You made her out
to be this, like, this, this...

877
00:49:17,524 --> 00:49:20,652
(Jeana)
...instead it's this big fight
between men and women.

878
00:49:20,728 --> 00:49:23,595
You don't, you don't think
her ears are a little big?

879
00:49:23,664 --> 00:49:27,930
Are you kidding? She's fantastic.
You can't even see her ears.

880
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:31,499
(Jeana)
I'm just sick
of the whole virgin-fest.

881
00:49:31,572 --> 00:49:32,869
That's not the real issue.

882
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,805
- What is?
- Love.

883
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:36,775
Respect. Oaring.

884
00:49:36,844 --> 00:49:40,712
And these are words that
nobody's mentioned since
this whole thing started.

885
00:49:40,781 --> 00:49:43,773
All my friends say
their first time was awful.

886
00:49:43,851 --> 00:49:48,618
It shouldn't be awful.
It... it should be astonishing
or superlative.

887
00:49:48,689 --> 00:49:51,157
It should be something
that's worth waiting for.

888
00:49:51,225 --> 00:49:55,423
It's hard enough being
single and scared and alone.

889
00:49:55,496 --> 00:49:57,964
And then you have people
smacking you in the face
every day

890
00:49:58,031 --> 00:49:59,999
with what a fool you are
for believing in love.

891
00:50:00,067 --> 00:50:04,595
Maybe if you wait
a little longer,
take a little more time...

892
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:07,799
She is so wise,
so together.

893
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:08,864
M m-hmm.

894
00:50:08,942 --> 00:50:13,140
...the right person
comes into your life,
and it's a whole new thing.

895
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:16,478
It's too bad you
just don't know who
that person's gonna be.

896
00:50:17,718 --> 00:50:18,707
Me.

897
00:50:18,786 --> 00:50:22,347
(Alison)
Your boyfriend revealed
your biggest secret on TV.

898
00:50:22,422 --> 00:50:25,619
Now here you are.

899
00:50:25,692 --> 00:50:27,353
Come on.

900
00:50:27,427 --> 00:50:29,292
Tell us a secret
of Tom's.

901
00:50:31,632 --> 00:50:33,031
I don't think he has any.

902
00:50:34,234 --> 00:50:36,168
There's not much
going on inside there.

903
00:50:37,171 --> 00:50:40,299
What?! There's a lot
going on inside here.

904
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:43,502
"So wise, so together"...

905
00:50:43,577 --> 00:50:46,307
(Tom)
Okay, she doesn't know
how I feel. I gotta talk to her.

906
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:48,871
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't wanna
go in there now.

907
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:51,713
Look at her...
she's all worked up,
and she's emotional.

908
00:50:51,785 --> 00:50:53,980
J ust, uh,
let her cool down.

909
00:50:54,054 --> 00:50:56,818
Okay. You're right.
You're always right.

910
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:00,951
She's gonna be at
the health club 'till 7: 00,
so I'll talk to her after.

911
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:08,360
She is photogenic,
though. Wow!

912
00:51:08,836 --> 00:51:10,827
She'll be at the health club
until 7: 00. I have to tell her.

913
00:51:11,471 --> 00:51:14,440
"I know you're Lindeman's
girlfriend. " She'll hate that!

914
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:17,767
H i. I'm Oarl.
Welcome to the club.

915
00:51:17,845 --> 00:51:20,245
H i, how are you?
I'm just here to talk
to someone.

916
00:51:20,314 --> 00:51:23,841
Well, you can talk to me.
U h, tell me, what exactly
are your fitness goals?

917
00:51:23,917 --> 00:51:25,077
I'm just looking for...

918
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:28,178
We've got a Premium
Membership you might
want to take a look at.

919
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:29,244
Oan I just...

920
00:51:29,323 --> 00:51:32,053
No, no, no.
We don't let non-members
wander around the club.

921
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:34,320
She's probably just
right around the corner.

922
00:51:34,394 --> 00:51:36,885
Ah, that's great.
You know, we got
full cardio...

923
00:51:36,964 --> 00:51:38,659
Free weights.
Pool, aerobics...

924
00:51:38,732 --> 00:51:41,064
U h-huh, right.
What's it gonna take?

925
00:51:41,134 --> 00:51:43,534
Hah!
I'm glad you asked.

926
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:52,270
This is the cardio area.

927
00:51:52,346 --> 00:51:54,177
(Jeana)
Hey!

928
00:51:54,248 --> 00:51:56,011
I know you.

929
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,415
Well, what...
I didn't know you...

930
00:51:58,485 --> 00:52:00,009
Paul here
just joined the club.

931
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:02,055
Thank you, Oarl.
Oan you give us
a minute?

932
00:52:02,122 --> 00:52:04,283
You know, I haven't
finished my tour yet.

933
00:52:06,126 --> 00:52:08,788
Okay. Hey! You know what?
You're gonna love this.

934
00:52:08,862 --> 00:52:13,595
It's so far out there.
I, um... I know...

935
00:52:18,005 --> 00:52:19,165

938
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:38,281
I know, uh, I was
pretending to be cool,

939
00:52:38,358 --> 00:52:40,792
but I would love it
if you'd come to my opening.

940
00:52:40,861 --> 00:52:42,419
- I'm coming.
- You are?

941
00:52:42,496 --> 00:52:44,225
Yeah. It's, uh,
this Friday, right?

942
00:52:44,298 --> 00:52:46,926
Yeah. Terrific, great.
Alright, it's a date.

943
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,865
Excuse me?

944
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:53,971
Oh, no. No, no, no,
not "It's a date",
like it's a figure of speech.

945
00:52:54,041 --> 00:52:56,373
Not like, not like
what you thought.
[Laughs]

946
00:52:56,443 --> 00:52:58,240
Not like a date.

947
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:03,311
Why don't we?

948
00:53:03,383 --> 00:53:05,078
I think we should.

949
00:53:07,187 --> 00:53:09,417
(Carl)
You know, you
shouldn't stop like that.

950
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:11,013
You need to warm down
before you...

951
00:53:11,091 --> 00:53:13,252
You don't date.

952
00:53:13,327 --> 00:53:15,192
It's against
your religion.

953
00:53:15,262 --> 00:53:18,254
Our whole friendship
is based on the fact
that you don't date

954
00:53:18,332 --> 00:53:21,631
and I won't. You said
yourself it's a mistake
to run to the next guy.

955
00:53:21,702 --> 00:53:24,262
Okay. But not if it's me.

956

958
00:53:37,451 --> 00:53:40,511
Wha... wha... whoa.
Why not?

959
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:43,283
I think I should be
by myself. Really.

960
00:53:43,357 --> 00:53:44,824
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

961
00:53:47,861 --> 00:53:49,726
Is that all it is?

962
00:53:51,031 --> 00:53:52,020
What else?

963
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:56,195
I don't know. Something like you
still have feelings for that guy
you were seeing.

964
00:53:56,269 --> 00:53:58,203
Get serious.

965
00:54:00,474 --> 00:54:02,408
What if he called you
tonight?

966
00:54:02,476 --> 00:54:04,467
I wouldn't care.

967
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:07,907

what your face says.

the tour yet.

970
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,653
Oarl, will you shut up!
Jeana, please?

971
00:54:21,995 --> 00:54:26,193
If you've gotten him
out of your system,
then why this big feud?

972
00:54:27,467 --> 00:54:29,526
Who called it a feud?

973
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:33,471
Well, n... no

Listen to me.

My life has been
a catastrophe lately.

977
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:49,350
I don't want to get
into details, and you
don't want to know.

978
00:54:49,423 --> 00:54:53,587
Believe me. The truth is,
I am thrilled you don't know.

979
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:57,560
You are?

980
00:54:57,631 --> 00:55:01,192
This friendship is
the only thing in my life
that's working.

981
00:55:01,268 --> 00:55:03,862
Oan't we just leave it be?

982
00:55:03,937 --> 00:55:07,839
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

983
00:55:09,042 --> 00:55:12,341
Thanks.

984
00:55:12,412 --> 00:55:15,711
So... maybe
I'll show up on Friday,

985
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:23,018
but that's the best
I can do.

986
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:27,186
She said "friendship",
man. You're history.

987

Now, how 'bout
those abs?

988
00:55:32,332 --> 00:55:35,995
We should be the town
of the toast, and you're
busy thinking or something.

989
00:55:36,069 --> 00:55:37,536
I got a lot on
my mind, Zsa, Zsa.

I don't need this.

992
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:46,846

with Fabio in the morning.

of companies they're hitting.

997
00:55:55,288 --> 00:55:56,277
Who has the list?

998
00:55:56,356 --> 00:55:59,018
It's in the inspection files
in the computer system.

999
00:55:59,092 --> 00:56:02,425
But only the computer people
have access to all the files.

1000
00:56:02,496 --> 00:56:06,296
Really?
Very interesting.

1001
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:08,197
Alright.

1002
00:56:09,069 --> 00:56:13,005
This is the most
sexual-looking food
I've ever seen.

1003
00:56:13,073 --> 00:56:15,064
(Jeana)
I wish you'd come with me.

1004
00:56:17,544 --> 00:56:18,977
Wow!

1005
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:22,276
It's an opening.
People dress up.

1006
00:56:24,217 --> 00:56:26,378
[Laughs]

1007
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:28,978
I would kill myself
for you.

1008
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,755
I would kill mys...
I would kill myself for you.

1009
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:40,896
I can't.

1010
00:56:53,747 --> 00:56:56,079
- H i.
- Hello, love. Oome on in.

1011
00:56:59,252 --> 00:57:01,117
Have a nice time.

1012
00:57:08,929 --> 00:57:10,897
Wow!
You look terrific.

1013
00:57:10,964 --> 00:57:12,556
Really.

1014
00:57:12,632 --> 00:57:14,497
I'm running late.

1015
00:57:14,568 --> 00:57:15,933
For what?

1016
00:57:16,002 --> 00:57:17,731
It's private.
Not for broadcast.

1017
00:57:17,804 --> 00:57:21,001
I'm working on a story about
bogus fire department
inspections

1018
00:57:21,074 --> 00:57:24,305
and, uh... I really
need some information.

1019
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:26,345
Me, help you?

1020
00:57:27,814 --> 00:57:30,146
You have every right
to hate me.

1021
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,478
What are we
doing here?

1022
00:57:35,555 --> 00:57:36,852
You love this place.

1023
00:57:36,923 --> 00:57:39,050
That's what I mean.

1024
00:57:45,565 --> 00:57:48,090
[Organ playing

1025
00:57:49,970 --> 00:57:51,403
[Crowd cheers]

1026
00:58:02,549 --> 00:58:03,982
Whoo!

1027
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:07,610
I'm not having fun.

1028
00:58:08,555 --> 00:58:10,921
Then you're crazy.
Look at this, it's perfect.

1029
00:58:14,261 --> 00:58:16,422
Okay.
[Clears throat]

1030
00:58:16,496 --> 00:58:20,398
It is dirty pool
bringing you here.
We had great times here.

1031
00:58:20,467 --> 00:58:23,300
But where can we go?
We had great times
all over this city.

1032
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,304
I thought we were gonna
talk about business.

1033
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:29,001
Jeana, I've broken up
with plenty of women

1034
00:58:29,075 --> 00:58:31,635
and this is the first time
I've ever done it

1035
00:58:31,711 --> 00:58:33,804
and thought about
that woman constantly.

1036
00:58:35,548 --> 00:58:37,743
Okay. You know
how you divide things up?

1037
00:58:37,817 --> 00:58:41,480
There's "her", and then
there's everything else.

1038
00:58:41,554 --> 00:58:43,181
"Her"?

1039
00:58:43,256 --> 00:58:44,814
You.

1040
00:58:44,891 --> 00:58:47,121
Ugh. I screwed that up.

1041
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:50,651
You know, I wrote some things
down here, some notes,
and, uh...

1042
00:58:54,701 --> 00:58:56,328
Okay. Okay.

1043
00:58:59,506 --> 00:59:00,666
I don't know.

1044
00:59:02,075 --> 00:59:05,772
I'm not very good
without a script,
but l... I wanna be.

1045
00:59:05,845 --> 00:59:07,710
Good.

1046
00:59:07,781 --> 00:59:09,510
For you.

1047
00:59:11,451 --> 00:59:12,941
I'm supposed
to be someplace.

1048
00:59:13,019 --> 00:59:14,281
Lemme explain.

1049
00:59:14,354 --> 00:59:16,584
Listen, we discuss
the district or I'm leaving.

1050
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:18,715
Okay. Alright. You win.

1051
00:59:20,994 --> 00:59:22,723
I need those
inspection files.

1052
00:59:23,596 --> 00:59:27,225
Well, then,
what's in it for me?

1053
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:34,436
Wait a minute.
Both tickets?

1054
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:37,908
One of them belongs to me,
and I'll trade you the files
for the other one.

1055
00:59:37,977 --> 00:59:39,410
That hardly seems fair.

1056
00:59:39,479 --> 00:59:43,279
H uh. "Fair"?
When'd you learn that word?

1057
00:59:44,818 --> 00:59:47,218
Okay. Alright. I know
we're having this fight,

1058
00:59:47,287 --> 00:59:49,687
but if we could just step
around it for a moment...

1059
00:59:49,756 --> 00:59:54,386
Oh! You can't step around it!
It's the same thing! You want
something for nothing!

1060
00:59:54,461 --> 00:59:57,157
You're the reason why
relationships don't work!

1061
00:59:57,230 --> 01:00:00,722
Okay. Blame me for
the world's problems.
Are you giving me the files?

1062
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,324
Are you giving me
the tickets?

1063
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:24,857
I'll stop by and
pick them up tomorrow.

I wanted to see
your pictures.

1066
01:00:46,546 --> 01:00:48,673
I got some at my place.

1067
01:00:53,086 --> 01:00:54,553
Okay.

1068
01:00:54,621 --> 01:00:56,782
That's a nice dress.

1069
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:00,153

(Paul)
Yes, ma'am. It went
really well, actually.

1071
01:01:09,569 --> 01:01:13,767
No. Well, I can't really
talk about that right now.

1072
01:01:15,208 --> 01:01:17,642
Because she's right here.

1073
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:22,477
Yeah. I'll talk
to you later, Mom.

1074
01:01:24,918 --> 01:01:27,352
H mph. Wrong number.

1075
01:01:28,621 --> 01:01:30,521
I kinda told her about you.

1076
01:01:32,859 --> 01:01:34,326
Would you like some tea?

1077
01:01:34,394 --> 01:01:36,191
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1081
01:01:52,412 --> 01:01:55,040
Thanks.
Thank you very much.

in Texarkana.

Then you know,
you know everything.

1136
01:06:18,911 --> 01:06:22,312
That is, uh,
fairly accurate.

1137
01:06:23,049 --> 01:06:25,745
I thought you were
the only guy in the world
who didn't know.

1138
01:06:25,818 --> 01:06:28,252
You're the guy
he's been blabbing to
in the first place.

1139
01:06:28,321 --> 01:06:29,982
Right. Jeana...

1140
01:06:30,056 --> 01:06:31,045
And you didn't tell me!

1141
01:06:31,124 --> 01:06:33,558
You didn't want me
to tell you!

dress as last night?

1143

What? What does
that mean?

1144
01:06:38,865 --> 01:06:40,389
(Marty)
It means,
you know, that...

1145
01:06:40,466 --> 01:06:42,434
She went home with
someone she barely knows.

1146
01:06:42,502 --> 01:06:44,129
What exactly
are you trying to imply?

1147
01:06:44,203 --> 01:06:46,330
How do you know what
dress she had on
last night?

1148
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:49,306
Because what
you're implying is none
of your business to imply.

1149
01:06:49,375 --> 01:06:50,603
You were with him
last night?

1150

How long has this
been going on?

1151
01:06:52,278 --> 01:06:53,643
You wore this dress
to see him.

1152
01:06:53,713 --> 01:06:54,702
I didn't "see" him.

1153
01:06:54,781 --> 01:06:56,476
You said she had
big ears.

1154
01:06:56,549 --> 01:06:58,483
- (Jeana) What?
- (Marty) That's just weird.

1155
01:06:58,551 --> 01:07:00,348
What were you doin'
together last night?

1156
01:07:00,419 --> 01:07:02,546
- What's the difference?
- There's a big difference.

1157
01:07:02,622 --> 01:07:04,055
- Gimme that.
- No.

1158
01:07:04,123 --> 01:07:07,684
I didn't plan on seeing him,
and you weren't honest.

1159
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:10,160
God, you're just
as much a guy
as the rest of them!

1160
01:07:10,229 --> 01:07:12,129
L... I can't believe
I did it again.

1161
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:13,995

like popcorn.

01:07:18,771 --> 01:07:20,966
Gimme the ball!

1165
01:07:21,040 --> 01:07:24,134
You told me that I was

01:07:24,210 --> 01:07:27,008
That was before I knew
that your "her" was my "her".

1167
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:30,742
As a matter of fact,
I can't even believe that
I have the same "her" as you.

1168
01:07:30,817 --> 01:07:33,342
Hey, wait a minute!
You two are ridiculous!

1169
01:07:33,419 --> 01:07:35,649
At least you have
somebody to fight over!

1170
01:07:35,721 --> 01:07:39,487
I have no one!
I just have my... my...
my work, my midget porn,

1171
01:07:39,559 --> 01:07:41,254
and...

1172
01:07:42,361 --> 01:07:44,454
Yeah, that was
kind of personal.

a chance the other night,

happened between us,

you told me about this trip?

in the face tonight for you?

big plan was all about?

That's why I'm calling
dispatch.

says call it off.

up to this, right?

1314

U h, no.
Never heard of him.

1315

But if you can
get back to your vehicle,

1316

we can finish this training
exercise and get you
out of here.

Ah, training exercise.
How clever.

the Fire Department.

in uniform, baby.

too tall for me?

Yeah.

She went to the airport with
whats-his-face five minutes ago.

go with him.

to the airport and start there.

01:29:39,477 --> 01:29:42,810
# I can fly around this world #

1498
01:29:42,881 --> 01:29:45,076
# And it may seem
Like something #

1499
01:29:45,150 --> 01:29:47,482
# But it don't mean nothing #

1500
01:29:48,052 --> 01:29:51,544
# Well, I don't care
If you're a boy or a girl #

1501
01:29:51,623 --> 01:29:56,060
# We all need something,
Just to keep us going #

1502
01:29:56,127 --> 01:30:01,429
# All I really need
Right now is you #

1503
01:30:04,369 --> 01:30:09,602
# So hold me, hold me #

1504
01:30:09,674 --> 01:30:12,472
# Make everything alright #

1505
01:30:13,545 --> 01:30:21,247
# Show me you love me
Tonight, tonight #

1506
01:30:21,319 --> 01:30:30,352
# So hold me, hold me tonight #

1507
01:30:30,428 --> 01:30:36,389
# Show me you love me tonight #

1508
01:30:38,503 --> 01:30:39,902
# Ah # #
