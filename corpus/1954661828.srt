I'm up.

Good luck.

7
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,395
Yes?

8
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,240
We are here to speak with Dr. Von Mobil.

9
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:19,776
About what?

10
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:21,743
We're from the Ministry of Knowledge.

11
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,540
Knowledge...

12
00:01:31,991 --> 00:01:34,892
Dr. Von Mobil<i>,</i> how are you feeling<i>,</i> sir?

13
00:01:35,462 --> 00:01:36,656
Wonderful.

14
00:01:37,864 --> 00:01:40,196
We need to ask you a few questions.

15
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,162
You want to know...

16
00:01:43,503 --> 00:01:45,027
what I have...

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:47,500
up here.

18
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,430
Nurse.

19
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:53,910
Thank you.

20
00:01:55,515 --> 00:01:57,449
Sir<i>,</i> you must help us.

21
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,952
Our research has shown
only you are old enough to recall...

22
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,116
life here before the magnetic storm
degaussed all recorded history.

23
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:08,285
We need to rebuild<i>,</i>
but before we can do so...

24
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:10,829
we need to know where we went wrong.

25
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,262
You must...

26
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,129
rebuild.

27
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,133
We know that<i>,</i> sir<i>,</i> but where do we begin?

28
00:02:19,205 --> 00:02:22,800
"'Four score and seven years ago...

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,538
Yes?

31
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,744
Our forefathers.
Tell us about our forefathers.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,947
The Constitution.

33
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:39,281
The Declaration of Independence.

Liberty? What is liberty?

44
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,518
Freedom.

45
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,790
What is freedom-dom?

46
00:03:16,896 --> 00:03:19,296
The Fourth of July.

47
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,292
What is the Fourth of July?

48
00:03:22,802 --> 00:03:25,134
The day it all began.

The day what began?

52

The birth...

<i>Dust growth has tripled</i>

<i>Repeat, evacuation needed</i>.

Adam-11?

60
00:06:17,744 --> 00:06:20,736
Isn't it a little late
for decorum<i>,</i> gentlemen?

61
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:23,344
We're from the Ministry of Knowledge.

62
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:27,814
I always wondered
what you guys looked like.

63
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:30,616
I'm Chevron-17.

64
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:34,156
This is Yale-44<i>,</i> Rons 29 through 31...

65
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:39,161
and of course from the Sector
of Psycho-Historical Inquiries<i>,</i> Heinz-57.

66
00:06:40,867 --> 00:06:43,358
Hello<i>,</i> Adam-11. Heinz-57.

67
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,330
Yeah. So what do you want?

68
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,404
According to the Ministry<i>,</i> two years ago...

69
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:52,842
you started filing requests
for tetrahydrozoline-6...

70
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,372
the main component of the Tetra-cell
to fuel the ship you've been working on.

71
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,512
I know what it's used for.

72
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,817
Adam-11<i>,</i> the Ministry has decided
to grant your request.

73
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:07,359
That's great.

74
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,256
That's just wonderful.

75
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,166
Ikiki Beach. Finally<i>,</i> I can go to paradise.

76
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,470
There's only one thing
we need you to do for us.

77
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:26,107
Chanel-6<i>,</i> our foremost
epistemological anthro-sociologist...

78
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:29,910
has redlined an outline
for a mission back in time.

79
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:33,317
We want you to pilot that mission.

80
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:38,083
Just out of curiosity<i>,</i>
how far back are we talking about?

81
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,218
1776. To the birth of our nation.

82
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:44,488
I'm not sure the ship would make it
that far back.

83
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,464
What better time to find out?

84
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:50,662
Find out? Why would I want to risk my life
for this mission?

85
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,799
You'd go down in history as a hero.

86
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:59,437
I'm not the hero type<i>,</i> and in case
you haven't noticed<i>,</i> history is over.

87
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,044
Not if we can save it.

88
00:08:02,281 --> 00:08:06,945
I'm not interested in saving anything.
All I wanted was the tetrahydrozoline.

89
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,514
If you think you can bribe me
by holding this over my head...

90
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,581
I'm afraid my answer will have to be...

91
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:14,649
I'm sorry I'm late<i>,</i> everyone.

92
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,718
I was held up at High Command.

93
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:36,813
So now<i>,</i> Chevron<i>,</i> how many people
are going to be in this crew?

94
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,412
<i>Three brave souls</i>...

00:08:39,485 --> 00:08:43,285

<i>now board the craft</i>.

97
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:49,758
<i>Due to the molecular gravitational shift</i>
<i>and planetary alignment</i>...

98
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:53,693
<i>they have only 12 hours</i>
<i>or they will be lost</i>...

99
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,596
<i>never able to reenter the present</i>.

100
00:08:56,969 --> 00:09:01,906
<i>On this historic day, we wish</i>
<i>our time travelers the best of luck</i>...

101
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:04,465
<i>and hope that the past they discover</i>...

102
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,139
<i>will be the key</i>
<i>which will unlock our future</i>.

103
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,444
You look very stellar<i>,</i> Chanel.

104
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,447
There's the date<i>,</i> 21...

105
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,755
Can't you work out here?

106
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,655
Don't worry<i>,</i> Chanel.

107
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:36,497
Whatever happens<i>,</i>
remember we only have 12 hours.

108
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:40,371
Well<i>,</i> this is it.

109
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,911
I can't believe this is actually working.

110
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,221
Baby<i>,</i> you ain't seen nothing yet.

111
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:09,991
Looks like we made it.

112
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,484
Look at this.

113
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,660
It's amazing.

114
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:40,859
Nature.

115
00:11:42,134 --> 00:11:43,863
I've heard of this.

116
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,162
So...

117
00:11:45,304 --> 00:11:48,239
still think this pile of junk is useless?

118
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:52,539
Do you mean that rhetorically<i>,</i>
or is this more idle flirtation?

119
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:57,607
I brought us to the birth of the nation.
The least you could say is thank you.

120
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,444
All right<i>,</i> Adam-11. A job well done.

121
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,862
Did you see the tubetop
Cheryl Dickman had on today?

122
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:17,059
Boner city! You could see
the whole outline and everything.

123
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,366
- Definite beat-off material.
- Totally.

124
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:22,202
Whoa<i>,</i> man! What is that?

125
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,439
I don't know.
Maybe it's a new sculpture or something.

126
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:28,810
Looks more like a pile of junk.

127
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,504
Let's check it out.

128
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,313
I'm into it. Let's go.

129
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,127
- Chris.
- Yeah?

130
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,000
Did I take any 'shrooms today?

131
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,835
Not to my knowledge.

132
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:56,772
What the hell is this?

133
00:12:56,842 --> 00:12:58,935
I don't know. Why don't we ask them?

134
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:01,479
Good idea. Why don't you go ahead?

135
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:03,941
Only two wheels.

136
00:13:04,183 --> 00:13:05,741
Curious design.

137
00:13:08,154 --> 00:13:09,587
What are those?

138
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:13,386
Banana Chopper Fours
with quarter spokes and full knobbies.

139
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,627
What's this?

140
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:20,622
Can we trust you?

141
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,228
Totally.

142
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:27,001
- This was our transportation here.
- Transportation?

143
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:31,636
We are from the year 2176.

144
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,403
Right. Now I get it.

145
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,609
These guys are definitely frying on acid.

146
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:42,518
- Probably still stuck in the '60s.
- Woodstock city.

147
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:45,385
Is this your communal hang-out
or something?

148
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:47,319
Heinz-57.

149
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,517
Chanel-6.

150
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,754
I'm Adam-11.

151
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,027
I'm Tommy Sears. I'm 17.

152
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,965
Chris Johnson. 18.

153
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,994
Oh<i>,</i> shit!

154
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:03,665
Snodgrass!

155
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,147
If it isn't Rodney Snodgrass.

156
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:17,213
I have been waiting for this my whole life.

157
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,223
How long have you boneheads been here?

158
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:23,222
Just a few minutes.

159
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,228
- Who are they?
- What's it to you?

160
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:30,964
God! You're so stupid!
Didn't you hear that noise?

161
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,029
Don't you know anything about UFOs?

162
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:39,308
Wait a second. You think this is a UFO?

163
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:41,539
Wait till I tell my brother.

164
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,715
Looks like I've got the science fair prize
wrapped up again this year.

165
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,584
Thank you very much.

166
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,387
- I'd like to wrap him up.
- Wait here until I get back.

167
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,363
I'm going to get some help.
If they try to leave<i>,</i> just stall them!

168
00:15:00,699 --> 00:15:01,927
Who was that?

169
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,596
- Rodney Snodgrass.
- Science whiz<i>,</i> UFO buff.

170
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:09,573
- All around pain in the ass know-it-all.
- Enemy of decent people everywhere.

171
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:12,509
- Enemy?
- It's not too cool for you guys to be here.

172
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,671
Do you know where we can hide?

173
00:15:17,316 --> 00:15:19,978
Chris<i>,</i> aren't those
your consumer-minded parents?

174
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,577
Looks like they bought another car.

175
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,817
Look<i>,</i> honey. It's the boys!

176
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,618
We're busted<i>,</i> dude.

177
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:32,027
Quick<i>,</i> hide. I'll handle this.

178
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:34,292
Behind the ship. Hide<i>,</i> dude.

179
00:15:38,904 --> 00:15:42,601
- Hello<i>,</i> Tommy.
- Hello<i>,</i> Mr. And Mrs. Johnson.

180
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:46,511
Tommy<i>,</i> please<i>,</i> call us Bob and Jean.

181
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:49,273
Okay<i>,</i> Jean.

182
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,511
- Hi<i>,</i> Son.
- Hi<i>,</i> Dad.

183
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,915
Look what your mother and I just bought.

184
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:57,615
Isn't it a beauty?

185
00:15:58,724 --> 00:16:00,692
Sure is wide.

186
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,487
- Son<i>,</i> you know how I got this car?
- How<i>,</i> Dad?

187
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,931
By believing in myself.

188
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,030
That's great<i>,</i> Dad.

189
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:15,663
I wish you'd let me take you
to one of the "'Be"' seminars<i>,</i> just once.

190
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:19,802
No<i>,</i> thanks<i>,</i> Dad.
With homework and summer school...

191
00:16:19,878 --> 00:16:22,904
Son<i>,</i> I'm not going to force you.

192
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,579
It's certainly not about that.

193
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,081
Thanks<i>,</i> Dad.

194
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,820
Well<i>,</i> we have to run.
We don't want to be late for the seminar.

195
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:36,552
I don't believe it.
They didn't say anything about the ship.

196
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:39,256
My parents are so insane. Watch this.

197
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,129
Mom<i>,</i> Dad!

198
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,266
Yes<i>,</i> Chris?

199
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,735
Is it okay if I keep this UFO
in the garage for a while?

200
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:49,639
Anything you want<i>,</i> Son.

201
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,236
God<i>,</i> I wish I had your parents<i>,</i> man.

202
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,053
<i>One and Two, come in</i>.

203
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:16,029
<i>Please report to Liberty Park</i>
<i>to investigate possible UFO sighted by</i>...

204
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:20,629
<i>ground central at quadrant four,</i>
<i>vector L-7 R-6. Over</i>.

205
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,564
Eddie<i>,</i> you're not going to believe this.

206
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,743
You drag me all the way out here
to show me dirt?

207
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,777
I thought you said there was a chick.

208
00:17:34,686 --> 00:17:37,814
Somebody moved it!

209
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:42,656
You got to stop reading all those
crazy magazines. You're losing your mind.

210
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,693
It was right here<i>,</i> I swear it!

211
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,156
- See what I see?
- I think so.

212
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:49,097
- What do you see?
- A guy.

213
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:50,658
That's what I see.

214
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,999
Hey<i>,</i> Eddie<i>,</i> wait!

215
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,605
Let's check it out.

216
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:14,681
Cool<i>,</i> huh?

217
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,255
Do you know these people?

218
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,661
- Man<i>,</i> I wish.
- Who are they?

219
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:23,565
Mel Schacher<i>,</i>
Don Brewer<i>,</i> and Mark Farner.

220
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:25,762
Grand Funk Railroad.

221
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:28,466
They are like "'the"' American band.

222
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:32,537
- "'The"' American band?
- Shit<i>,</i> yeah.

223
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,342
They like<i>,</i> "'Come into your town
and help you party down."'

224
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,680
"'Help you party down."'

225
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,548
Totally.

226
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:08,639
Haven't you ever seen
an 8-track player before?

227
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:11,308
Don't they have those in the future?

228
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,745
You still don't believe us?

229
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:15,978
No.

230
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,018
Then why are you helping us?

231
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:22,557
I would do anything in this world
just for once to see...

232
00:19:22,628 --> 00:19:25,096
Rodney Snodgrass not get what he wants.

233
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:29,225
- And he wants you.
- And the science fair prize money.

234
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:33,064
- Prize money?
- Yeah. It's like $300 this year.

235
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,437
$300? Is that a lot?

236
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,805
Dude! Are you shitting us?

237
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:39,367
No.

238
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:43,440
Look.

239
00:19:44,883 --> 00:19:48,046
There must be thousands of dollars here!

240
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,179
Where we come from<i>,</i> money is worthless.

241
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,450
Inflation city.

242
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:56,388
You guys really aren't from around here<i>,</i>
are you?

243
00:19:56,461 --> 00:19:59,487
- It figures Rodney know-it-all was right.
- The shit.

244
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:03,298
- Open up<i>,</i> you guys!
- We're busted.

245
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,233
I know you're in there!

246
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,671
It's cool. I'll handle this.

247
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:11,607
I heard you playing Grand Funk.
Open up or I'll call the cops!

248
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:17,104
All right<i>,</i> what did you do with it?

249
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:20,913
- Do with what?
- You know with what. The UFO.

250
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:23,647
There's no such thing as UFOs.

251
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:26,384
What do you think
was in the park<i>,</i> genius?

252
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:29,889
Haven't you ever heard
of a public sculpture before?

253
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,862
Look<i>,</i> Johnson<i>,</i> if you'd help me out...

254
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:40,201
I'd be willing to cut you and Sears in
on the science fair prize money.

255
00:20:40,272 --> 00:20:42,502
Blow butt<i>,</i> Snodgrass.

256
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,571
Fine! I don't need your help!

257
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,340
I have all the proof I need right here!

258
00:20:49,548 --> 00:20:51,482
See you around<i>,</i> sucker!

259
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,953
Up your nose with a rubber hose!

260
00:20:57,055 --> 00:21:00,821
Listen up. If I know Rodney<i>,</i>
he's going straight to the cops.

261
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,627
You guys are going to be like suspect city.

262
00:21:03,695 --> 00:21:06,960
I suggest we get you guys
some new threads immediately.

263
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,661
Right on!

264
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:44,402
I have found
some very interesting artifacts.

265
00:21:45,337 --> 00:21:46,827
Look at this.

266
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,774
What is it?

267
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:54,903
It appears to be footwear.

268
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:08,458
Can I help you with something<i>,</i>
or something?

269
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,995
I was just looking at this.

270
00:22:12,197 --> 00:22:15,860
What sign are you?
My mood ring totally changed colors.

271
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:17,660
Sign?

272
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:20,465
You know<i>,</i> of the zodiac.

273
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:27,472
I bet you're a Capricorn.
Caps are always so forgetful.

274
00:22:28,613 --> 00:22:29,841
Capricorn.

275
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,539
I knew it!

276
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:34,411
I'm psychic.

277
00:22:34,486 --> 00:22:38,582
Not really. I can't bend spoons<i>,</i>
but I can usually tell signs.

278
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,582
- Hi<i>,</i> Cheryl.
- Oh<i>,</i> hi.

279
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,486
I'll see you later. Ciao.

280
00:22:47,466 --> 00:22:48,592
Ciao?

281
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:05,710
You know<i>,</i> we're not here to make friends.

282
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:08,981
Wow<i>,</i> you look great. Boner city.

283
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:12,153
Thank you.

284
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,255
You know<i>,</i> Chanel...

285
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:19,325
I've been planning a little trip
to a place called lkiki Beach.

286
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,592
I thought after this little mission was over<i>,</i>
you might want to join me.

287
00:23:23,668 --> 00:23:26,193
- "'Little"' mission?
- Relax.

288
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:30,833
Relax? You don't seem to understand.
This is no time to relax!

289
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,709
This "'little"' mission may just determine
the future of this planet.

290
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,113
- Come on<i>,</i> I didn't mean anything...
- What are you here for<i>,</i> anyway?

291
00:23:38,183 --> 00:23:39,980
That's what I was saying.

292
00:23:40,051 --> 00:23:44,351
When I go back<i>,</i> they'll give me enough
tetrahydrozoline to go anywhere in time.

293
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,756
- And I just...
- And that's why you took this mission?

294
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:52,691
- Well<i>,</i> yeah.
- Is that all you think about? Yourself?

295
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:57,926
Don't you care that our world is dying
and that we have a chance to save it?

296
00:23:58,003 --> 00:23:59,664
Of course I care.

297
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:04,269
I was just thinking about
after we save the world.

298
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,643
Just try to blend in. Just be cool.

299
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:16,347
- I think Heinz got the wrong size suit.
- Yeah. It's a little tight.

300
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,529
You think that was them?

301
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,362
I don't know.
It didn't look like them to me.

302
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:29,525
- Maybe we should've asked.
- Asked what?

303
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,159
If it was them.

304
00:24:31,603 --> 00:24:33,366
- You think so?
- What?

305
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:35,696
That we should've asked them.

306
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:38,441
Headquarters<i>,</i> come in.

307
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,809
This is One and Two
requesting back-up at Taylor and Main.

308
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:44,476
We think it's them.

309
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:48,380
- Rodney<i>,</i> where the hell are you?
- I'm busy.

310
00:24:53,191 --> 00:24:56,160
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Yes<i>,</i> is your refrigerator running?

311
00:24:56,294 --> 00:24:57,921
<i>Why, yes, it is</i>.

312
00:24:58,096 --> 00:24:59,791
Better go catch it!

313
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:09,697
What the hell did you do
with my gold razor blade?

314
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:13,274
Goddamn it<i>,</i> Eddie<i>,</i> you idiot!
My evidence!

315
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:16,180
Sorry. Hope it wasn't anything important.

316
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:17,904
Thanks.

317
00:25:21,052 --> 00:25:25,148
<i>The birth rate is now at 20 percent</i>
<i>and falling</i>.

318
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,297
Hi. My name is Cyndi.

319
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:41,135
And I'll be your waitress
on this very special Fourth of July.

320
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:42,797
Heinz-57.

321
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,809
I can tell you're ready to put in
your special order. What can I get for you?

322
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,644
Cyndi<i>,</i> I'm looking for the Constitution.

323
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:55,618
- We just ran out of the Constitution.
- Ran out?

324
00:25:55,687 --> 00:25:58,053
I know<i>,</i> it's terrible.

325
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:02,389
But the Bill of Rights burger is
just as good and comes with the salad bar.

326
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,894
No<i>,</i> I must have the Constitution.

327
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:09,227
Well<i>,</i> if you take
the Valley Forge tuna melt...

328
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:13,169
and replace the dill spears
with pickle relish<i>,</i> you'll get pretty close.

329
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,502
Valley Forge<i>,</i> barf city.

330
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:21,234
Why don't you think it over<i>,</i>
talk amongst yourselves...

331
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:23,213
and I'll be back in a little bit.

332
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:25,038
Valley Forge.

333
00:26:26,551 --> 00:26:28,178
Barf city?

334
00:26:29,788 --> 00:26:33,451
If you don't mind my asking<i>,</i>
what exactly is your mission?

335
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:37,617
We've come here to retrieve
the heritage of our nation.

336
00:26:37,796 --> 00:26:39,423
The Constitution.

337
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:43,466
Are you for real?
You came all this way just for that?

338
00:26:44,302 --> 00:26:45,394
Dude.

339
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:49,035
- Do you know where can we find it?
- Any library.

340
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,639
Excellent. I suggest we individuate
and meet back at the...

341
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:55,944
Crash pad.

342
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:59,116
Heinz<i>,</i> you get to the library
and retrieve the documents.

343
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,812
I'll decode and collect
all the aesthetic data.

344
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,049
Adam-11<i>,</i> you research
the various technological...

345
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:08,923
Wait a second. Hold on.
Since when are you giving the orders?

346
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:13,326
Adam-11<i>,</i> this is no time
for petty ego arguments.

347
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:16,231
Since you're here<i>,</i> you might as well help.

348
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,728
I signed on to operate the craft.

349
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,601
Saving the future
was never really my interest in life.

350
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:25,473
- It's about time you made it your interest.
- Calm down.

351
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:28,171
And it's time you stopped telling me
what to do.

352
00:27:28,246 --> 00:27:29,611
Oh<i>,</i> brother.

353
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,876
You're either with us on this or you're not.

354
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:36,114
All right<i>,</i> the plan is clear. We all know
what we have to do. Now let's just...

355
00:27:36,521 --> 00:27:37,317
do it.

356
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:39,953
- That was expensive.
- I know.

357
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:44,291
I can't wait until we go metric.
Everything will be so much cheaper then.

358
00:27:45,263 --> 00:27:48,391
- Oh<i>,</i> man<i>,</i> cop city.
- We're busted.

359
00:27:48,733 --> 00:27:50,428
- Come on.
- Let's go!

360
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,265
Hold it right there!

361
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,828
- Where are you going<i>,</i> Adam?
- Run<i>,</i> Chanel.

362
00:28:04,315 --> 00:28:06,010
This way<i>,</i> come on.

363
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:16,258
Excuse me<i>,</i> officers<i>,</i> could you direct me
to the nearest Miller's Outpost?

364
00:28:17,729 --> 00:28:20,220
- Look<i>,</i> another streaker.
- Nice butt.

365
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,208
- Hold it!
- Freeze<i>,</i> right there!

366
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,434
Hey<i>,</i> mellow out.

367
00:29:03,308 --> 00:29:06,675
- You want to smoke some Lumbo?
- Lumbo?

368
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:12,045
It's got a little paraquat in it<i>,</i>
but that was two weeks ago.

369
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:16,610
It should be all right by now.
I mean<i>,</i> that stuff dissipates really fast.

370
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,289
Can I help you?

371
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:24,317
I need some papers<i>,</i> man.
I need about a case of rolling papers.

372
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:27,831
And I want to look
at some of these hash pipes<i>,</i> too.

373
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:33,593
And I want to see that roach clip.
I like that one with the feather on it.

374
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:39,810
Hey. Check this out<i>,</i> man!

375
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:42,911
What is it?

376
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,009
It's a bong<i>,</i> man.

377
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:49,753
- Bong?
- Yeah. A Bicentennial bong.

378
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:53,188
See<i>,</i> it's got pictures
of the Founding Fathers on it.

379
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:55,191
The Founding Fathers?

380
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,522
Except the pictures
should have been down here...

381
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,565
so you can check 'em out
when you get wasted.

382
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,431
<i>The employment index</i>...

383
00:30:04,502 --> 00:30:07,801
<i>is at minus 027 and falling</i>.

384
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,472
Hey<i>,</i> you in the orange suit.

385
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,041
You lookin' like a man of leisure.
Come on over here a moment.

386
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,246
I can't. I'm being pursued.

387
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:26,449
You're being pursued?
Let Clovis fix you up.

388
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,123
I got a place where you can hide.

389
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:38,299
Ask. Know Miss Liberty.

390
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:42,032
- You know Thomas Jefferson?
- I know Luther Jefferson.

391
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:52,316
Hi. I'm lusty Miss Liberty<i>,</i>
here to cater and fulfill your every desire.

392
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:59,986
So what gets you off?

393
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:03,324
You see<i>,</i> I come from the future.

394
00:31:03,761 --> 00:31:07,162
Wait. Let me guess.
Science fiction fantasy?

395
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,929
No<i>,</i> psycho-historical studies.

396
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:14,402
I was on my way to the library
in search of the Constitution...

397
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,639
Wait. Did you say the Constitution?

398
00:31:18,509 --> 00:31:22,309
Yes. In the future<i>,</i>
this document will be lost.

399
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,944
I say it may as well be lost today.

400
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,011
How do you mean?

401
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,015
Let's take a look
at the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution...

402
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,082
because<i>,</i> in a sense<i>,</i>
that's where it all starts.

403
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,197
A lie from the President to manipulate
Congress to fund an undeclared war?

404
00:31:40,365 --> 00:31:44,461
Not only does this render the tripartite
system functionally useless...

405
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:48,938
but clearly violates the oath of office
prescribed by the Constitution itself.

406
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:51,108
Amazing.

407
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,498
So<i>,</i> listen<i>,</i> you want to get high?

408
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:20,299
I got my van parked out front
and I got this killer sinsemilla.

409
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,737
Yes<i>,</i> let's get high.

410
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:27,041
What's a girl like you doing
in a nice place like this?

411
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,510
I was just leaving.

412
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:31,480
With this guy? What gives?

413
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,449
Give it up<i>,</i> Snodgrass.

414
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:36,351
Trojan! The name is Eddie Trojan.

415
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:41,190
But you<i>,</i> my dreambucket<i>,</i>
can call me Eddie.

416
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:45,228
You<i>,</i> my dreambucket<i>,</i>
can call him dickhead. Later.

417
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:49,324
How would you like
to boogie down sometime?

418
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:53,461
- Boogie?
- You know<i>,</i> let loose. I'm talking...

419
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,821
- I know I'm good<i>,</i> but...
- Let's leave.

420
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,091
Whatever you say.

421
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,885
Oh<i>,</i> shit. Here come the fuzz.

422
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:24,027
So with Watergate we see the last nail...

423
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,223
driven into the coffin
of the electoral process itself.

424
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:31,792
You see<i>,</i> Heinz<i>,</i> how essential it is that
this document be observed to the letter.

425
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:33,359
- There he is!
- Hold it!

426
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,633
- Move around the front!
- Let's go!

427
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,168
- Thank you<i>,</i> Clovis.
- Right on.

428
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,972
Come on!

429
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,986
That way. I know a shortcut.

430
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,742
Is that the kind of car I think that is?

431
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,410
- But it didn't even hit it.
- Doesn't have to.

432
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:24,684
Let's get out of here.

433
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:39,835
Man<i>,</i> that was more cops
than <i>Starsky and Hutch</i>!

434
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,372
I thought for sure we were busted!

435
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:43,996
Cop city!

436
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,535
Everyone<i>,</i> please take a seat.

437
00:36:20,311 --> 00:36:23,644
You're just in time.
You're the last one we're letting in.

438
00:36:24,715 --> 00:36:26,683
Please make yourself comfortable.

439
00:36:28,219 --> 00:36:30,312
We're going to be here a while<i>,</i> okay?

440
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,114
Great.

441
00:36:41,999 --> 00:36:43,193
Super.

442
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,100
First time?

443
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:46,761
Yes.

444
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,566
This guy is going to blow your mind.

445
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:56,070
The first time I was here<i>,</i>
I shit in my pants...

446
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,313
and then got a raise the very next day.

447
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:01,975
How does it feel...

448
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:04,149
to be...

449
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:06,421
an asshole?

450
00:37:08,259 --> 00:37:10,022
How does that feel?

451
00:37:11,596 --> 00:37:14,064
Because whether you know it or not...

452
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:16,258
you're all assholes.

453
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,636
Come on<i>,</i> say it with me.

454
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,769
"'I am an asshole!"'

455
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,909
You're not getting it. Say it loud.

456
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:34,907
"'I am an asshole!"'

457
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,479
Good.

458
00:37:39,657 --> 00:37:42,956
Want to hear my new 8-track stereo?
It's real bitchin'.

459
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:46,422
- You know<i>,</i> they call me the bonemaster.
- Really?

460
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:02,739
I know I'm hot stuff<i>,</i> but how come
you're so keen on seeing my pad?

461
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:06,308
Let's just say you fascinate me<i>,</i> Eddie.

462
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,880
Whatever.

463
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:17,384
So this is where you live?

464
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,453
For now. This is just a temporary thing.

465
00:38:20,665 --> 00:38:23,896
Soon as I get my real estate license<i>,</i>
I'm outta here.

466
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:27,333
Wanna go in your folks' house
and show Adam how to play Atari?

467
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:32,206
Tommy<i>,</i> in case you forgot<i>,</i>
we totally agreed to help save the world.

468
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,138
- What did Chanel want us to do?
- Gather the artifacts.

469
00:38:37,214 --> 00:38:39,239
Okay<i>,</i> cool. I'm into it. Let's do it.

470
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,711
There's one thing<i>,</i> though.
What's an artifact?

471
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,157
- Oh<i>,</i> man! I thought that you knew!
- How am I supposed to know?

472
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,696
Adam<i>,</i> don't think I'm a dork<i>,</i>
but what's an artifact?

473
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:57,768
I don't know. All this stuff. Like this.

474
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,496
What is this?

475
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,865
- Tang!
- Tang?

476
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:05,067
It's like orange juice<i>,</i>
it's sort of a breakfast drink.

477
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:07,633
But you don't have to drink it
just for breakfast.

478
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,237
It's what the astronauts drink in space.

479
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:14,148
- What do your astronauts do in space?
- All kinds of stuff.

480
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,413
They put an American flag on the moon.

481
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,717
Played golf and jumped around a lot.

482
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,950
They did a lot of stuff for mankind.

483
00:39:21,325 --> 00:39:22,519
Really?

484
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,491
It didn't work.

485
00:39:36,006 --> 00:39:38,566
Oh<i>,</i> no. The Tetra-cell is gone!

486
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:40,710
- The what?
- The battery!

487
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,303
Snodgrass!

488
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,542
The Lumis-Foil is starting to erode.

489
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,484
Bummer. Nothing like eroded Lumis-Foil.

490
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:53,683
- What's Lumis-Foil?
- It protects the internal conduit controls.

491
00:39:53,958 --> 00:39:57,291
However<i>,</i> without the Tetra-cell<i>,</i>
the Lumis-Foil will decay...

492
00:39:57,361 --> 00:40:01,297
and the transfer of anti-matter through
time will no longer be contingent...

493
00:40:01,365 --> 00:40:03,663
Are we gonna be tested on this?

494
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,601
Really<i>,</i> dude<i>,</i> just speak English.

495
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:11,334
It means we must get the Tetra-cell back.
We have to find Snodgrass. Where is he?

496
00:40:11,942 --> 00:40:13,569
The science lab!

497
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,916
Didn't your mother teach you not to steal?

498
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:27,321
You guys should have shared with me.
Then I wouldn't have had to steal!

499
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,359
Excuse me<i>,</i> Mr. Kipper!

500
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,225
Toadblock!

501
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,371
- Make mine well done<i>,</i> honey.
- Right up.

502
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,746
That's it<i>,</i> Billy<i>,</i> hit him hard.

503
00:40:56,987 --> 00:40:58,386
Let's get him.

504
00:41:02,493 --> 00:41:04,427
Mind if I borrow this?

505
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,754
Cool! Just like Snake Canyon!
Evil Kneviel!

506
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,861
- Wipe out!
- Come on. He's getting away!

507
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,369
- Coming through!
- Drop dead<i>,</i> Rodney.

508
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,846
What the hell are you doing?

509
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:39,523
Oh<i>,</i> man!

510
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:42,088
It's gonna blow!

511
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,867
Isn't that nice?

512
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,307
Now we boogie.

513
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,921
I've heard this before.

514
00:42:06,156 --> 00:42:08,454
Sure you have. It's <i>The Hustle</i>.

515
00:42:11,428 --> 00:42:15,159
Would it be fair to say
that a lot of people live like you do?

516
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:19,028
Hey<i>,</i> maybe a lot of people like me...

517
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,528
but there's no one like me.

518
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,669
Know what I'm saying?

519
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,105
There's only one Eddie Trojan.

520
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,041
So what are we waiting for? Let's boogie.

521
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:37,882
You're an asshole.

522
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,649
And you're an asshole.

523
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:45,686
Excuse me<i>,</i> sir.

524
00:42:47,164 --> 00:42:50,861
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm sorry<i>,</i> but I have to leave.

525
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,593
You have to leave?

526
00:42:53,604 --> 00:42:57,040
That's very interesting.
Where do you have to leave to?

527
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,868
I must get to the library...

528
00:42:59,944 --> 00:43:02,276
No<i>,</i> no!

529
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:10,209
You don't have to get to the library.
You want to get to the library.

530
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:15,416
Do you see what I'm getting at?
You see the difference?

531
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,390
I must leave.

532
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,189
Buddy<i>,</i> you don't understand.

533
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,759
These seminars...

534
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:24,992
they're about commitment.

535
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,866
Now<i>,</i> if you get it<i>,</i>
I'd be happy to let you leave.

536
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:31,374
But do you get it?

537
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,204
Get what?

538
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:34,976
What's your name?

539
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,443
Heinz...

540
00:43:36,513 --> 00:43:39,414
Heinz<i>,</i> for the remainder of this seminar...

541
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:43,245
you will be referred to as Heinz Asshole.

542
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:48,291
Now<i>,</i> please<i>,</i> take a seat.

543
00:43:50,027 --> 00:43:51,358
Wonderful.

544
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:57,065
<i>Our time travelers have just under</i>
<i>five hours left. We wish them luck</i>.

545
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,193
Thanks. We'll need it.

546
00:44:13,417 --> 00:44:14,941
"'Carbon dioxide."'

547
00:44:31,535 --> 00:44:32,763
No!

548
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,168
What are you trying to do<i>,</i> kill yourself?

549
00:44:36,106 --> 00:44:40,907
Lethal combo. Ten kids already died with
those things exploding in their stomachs.

550
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:42,969
The carbonation triggers it off.

551
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,982
- Then<i>,</i> kaboom!
- Explosion city!

552
00:44:47,051 --> 00:44:49,383
Did you catch up with Snodgrass?

553
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:53,385
Okay. Good news and bad news.

554
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:57,927
The good news is<i>,</i> we just saved your life<i>,</i>
for which you should be eternally grateful.

555
00:44:58,162 --> 00:44:59,789
And the bad news?

556
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,225
The bad news concerns the Tetra-cell.

557
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,098
It's gone.

558
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,396
- Gone? What do you mean<i>,</i> gone?
- Well<i>,</i> it like totally exploded.

559
00:45:13,944 --> 00:45:15,104
I see.

560
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,674
So<i>,</i> what you're saying...

561
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,051
is that I'm stuck here.

562
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:27,051
Forever.

563
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,286
Bummer.

564
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:31,827
Really. Now you know how we feel.

565
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:34,121
Why didn't I listen to myself?

566
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:37,463
I knew from the start
this mission thing was not a good idea.

567
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:39,802
Then why did you do it?

568
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:45,174
Tommy<i>,</i> why does any man
do what he does?

569
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,322
You're getting it. That's hot.

570
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:11,895
Eddie<i>,</i> you won't believe
what happened to me.

571
00:46:15,305 --> 00:46:17,535
What do you want now<i>,</i> Rodney?

572
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:25,278
Eddie<i>,</i> that's one of them.
She's one of them.

573
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,873
- What are you talking about?
- When I took you to where they landed.

574
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,716
She's one of the crew
that was standing by the ship.

575
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,223
I thought I told you
to forget about that stuff.

576
00:46:42,399 --> 00:46:46,699
There's no telling what they might
be up to. We have to call the CIA!

577
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,898
- You're not calling the CIA.
- Yes<i>,</i> I am!

578
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:54,774
Adam-11 to Chanel-6. Come in<i>,</i> Chanel-6.

579
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:57,040
Chanel-6. Go ahead<i>,</i> Adam-11.

580
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:01,977
Bum-out. The Tetra-cell has been stolen
and destroyed.

581
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:06,680
You might as well just take it easy.
This mission is over.

582
00:47:07,691 --> 00:47:10,524
This mission is not over.

583
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:14,327
You agreed to pilot us here
and take us back.

584
00:47:14,398 --> 00:47:17,595
Not leave us stranded here in 1776.

585
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:20,727
I didn't plan on having
the Tetra-cell stolen<i>,</i> did I?

586
00:47:20,804 --> 00:47:23,898
And I didn't plan on having our pilot
turn out to be a quitter.

587
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,539
What's all that noise? Where are you?

588
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:32,313
If you must know<i>,</i>
I am in the safe hands of Eddie Trojan.

589
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:33,972
<i>The bonemaster</i>.

590
00:47:34,751 --> 00:47:37,083
And just what are you doing in his hands?

591
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,087
I'm learning how to dance.

592
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:45,420
Dancing? Oh<i>,</i> that's good. I can see
how that's going to save the future.

593
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,596
Perhaps I should ask Eddie
to build the Tetra-cell...

594
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:50,963
since you don't seem to be up to the task.

595
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,728
Alien or not<i>,</i> I got a good chance
of getting a piece of ass here.

596
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:57,535
You mess this one up
and I'll punch your lights out.

597
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:00,032
You're so stupid.

598
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,011
It takes one to know one.

599
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,493
- CIA?
- <i>Yes</i>.

600
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:29,005
<i>The suicide rate has just overtaken</i>
<i>the birth rate</i>.

601
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:33,376
How can I get out of here? I must leave.

602
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:36,241
You can't leave. It's part of the process.

603
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:40,374
Because when you get right down to it<i>,</i>
when push comes to shove...

604
00:48:41,618 --> 00:48:43,483
it's about freedom.

605
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:48,116
And when I talk about freedom...

606
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:53,761
I'm not talking about the kind
you get when you buy a box of maxi-pads.

607
00:48:54,932 --> 00:48:58,129
I'm talking about freedom
with a capital "'F."'

608
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,699
Freedom of choice.

609
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:05,774
You want that raise
with the $10<i>,</i>000 bonus?

610
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:09,403
- Sure.
- Then<i>,</i> baby<i>,</i> goddamn it<i>,</i> you take it...

611
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,814
because it belongs to you.

612
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:16,943
But don't just dream it.

613
00:49:19,022 --> 00:49:20,011
Be it.

614
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:23,183
Be.

615
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,585
Say it with me.

616
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:28,261
"'Be."'

617
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:40,701
Good.

618
00:49:42,245 --> 00:49:44,042
Can an artifact be food?

619
00:49:44,114 --> 00:49:47,083
'Cause I just totally raided
my folks' kitchen.

620
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:48,878
Killer! Let's scarf.

621
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,950
- You want a Snowball?
- No<i>,</i> thanks.

622
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,921
Come on<i>,</i> lighten up.
You're bumming me out.

623
00:49:56,426 --> 00:49:59,793
Did you know that if I made it back...

624
00:49:59,863 --> 00:50:03,458
they were going to give me
all the tetrahydrozoline-6 I wanted?

625
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,195
- Tetra-what?
- Tetrahydrozoline-6.

626
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:07,702
What is it?

627
00:50:07,771 --> 00:50:11,400
A very rare chemical that
the government keeps under tight control.

628
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,542
- I've heard of that.
- I doubt it very highly.

629
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:16,303
No<i>,</i> really<i>,</i> I have.

630
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:19,281
Tetrahydrozoline. I've heard of that<i>,</i> too.

631
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,284
Tetrahydrozoline<i>,</i> tetrahydrozoline...

632
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:26,420
Eye drops!

633
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:29,986
- Shit<i>,</i> man. That's it!
- That's what?

634
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:33,655
Dude<i>,</i> it's eye cleaner stuff.
It puts the white back in.

635
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:37,291
A common household item.
"'Now with tetrahydrozoline."'

636
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:39,130
"'Available in econo-size."'

637
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,727
You know how valuable this will be
one day?

638
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:46,265
It's valuable now<i>,</i> like when you don't
want your parents to know you're stoned.

639
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,903
- Can we get more of this?
- Shitloads.

640
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:50,836
Unbelievable.

641
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:55,283
Now all we need is some carbon dioxide
to act as a catalyst.

642
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,252
That may be a little more difficult.

643
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,049
- Carbon city.
- What?

644
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,019
It's carbon dioxide!

645
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,888
In other words<i>,</i> we have the technology.

646
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,655
We can rebuild it.

647
00:51:05,762 --> 00:51:09,095
One more thing. I don't think
the ship is safe here anymore.

648
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,465
Snodgrass knows where it is.
And God knows who he's told by now.

649
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:14,094
Where can we hide it?

650
00:51:15,305 --> 00:51:16,567
Totally!

651
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:30,514
- Honey<i>,</i> isn't that Chester McAndrew?
- Yes<i>,</i> it is.

652
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,521
I think he won last year.

653
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,216
Very bright boy. Very bright.

654
00:51:38,528 --> 00:51:41,088
Watch it<i>,</i> Johnson.
You'll scare my hamster!

655
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,860
- Well<i>,</i> don't bogart the table.
- Really.

656
00:51:51,675 --> 00:51:53,074
How's the Lumis-Foil doing?

657
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:55,873
It's definitely seen better days.
We'll have to work fast.

658
00:51:55,946 --> 00:52:00,007
Tommy<i>,</i> get the carbon dioxide. Chris<i>,</i>
as much tetrahydrozoline as you can.

659
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:01,482
Let's book!

660
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:06,115
Eddie<i>,</i> I must go now.
I wonder<i>,</i> could you give me a ride...

661
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:08,657
Hey<i>,</i> where's the fire?

662
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:10,950
Get to know me.

663
00:52:16,433 --> 00:52:19,061
- Do you hear what I hear?
- I think so.

664
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,229
What do you hear?

665
00:52:22,405 --> 00:52:25,033
- A woman's voice.
- That's what I hear.

666
00:52:25,108 --> 00:52:27,668
Eddie<i>,</i> what exactly are you doing?

667
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,103
Babe<i>,</i> I can't help myself.

668
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,745
When I think about you<i>,</i> I think about love.

669
00:52:35,585 --> 00:52:39,282
- You're under arrest.
- Is there a law against trying to get laid?

670
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,256
Not him! The girl!

671
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:43,292
We knew that.

672
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,952
You'll have to come with us.

673
00:52:45,428 --> 00:52:49,091
<i>Adam to Chanel, important change</i>
<i>of plans. Meet at 1700 at</i>...

674
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,963
You can't take her! She's mine!

675
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:13,986
Come on<i>,</i> let's get him!

676
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:25,793
Heinz here.

677
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,270
<i>Lumis-Foil eroding. Ship in great danger</i>.

678
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:31,897
<i>Meet at science fair at 1700</i>.

679
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:35,073
- But the...
- <i>Forget about the Constitution</i>.

680
00:53:35,145 --> 00:53:37,875
<i>Meet at the science fair at 1700. Over</i>.

681
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,843
But<i>,</i> Chanel...

682
00:53:41,451 --> 00:53:45,683
that stuff they're saying about you
being an alien. Is any of that true?

683
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,124
- Of course not<i>,</i> Eddie.
- Oh<i>,</i> good.

684
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,254
Can't this thing go any faster?

685
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:54,423
I didn't put a 427 with a four-barrel
Holley carb in here for nothing.

686
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,527
You dance so good<i>,</i>
I think we're ready for the big time.

687
00:54:18,321 --> 00:54:20,289
Did they see us come in here?

688
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:25,158
No<i>,</i> I think we're safe in here.
Besides<i>,</i> I'll take care of you.

689
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:30,863
I'm real thirsty.
Why don't you get us something to drink?

690
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,237
Great idea.
I'll meet you on the dance floor.

691
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,415
<i>Chanel-6 to Adam-11. Come in, Adam-11</i>.

692
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:47,811
Adam-11.

693
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:52,384
Did not receive entire message.
Please repeat.

694
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:54,685
You didn't hear it? Where were you?

695
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:57,249
In order to protect this mission
I was unable...

696
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,387
If you don't make it to the science fair
by 1700...

697
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,624
this mission will never have existed.

698
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,700
<i>One hour and counting</i>.

699
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:09,628
Being and freedom.

700
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:15,142
Why do I say these words
in the same breath?

701
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:25,914
The Constitution.

702
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:29,224
I must have your shirt.

703
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,659
There's a sale on them at the Rainbow.

704
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,888
You mean there's more than one?

705
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:38,297
Sure. Everybody's wearing them.

706
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,499
I'll give you $500 for yours.

707
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:44,734
All right<i>,</i> $1<i>,</i>000.

708
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,976
Now<i>,</i> don't get me wrong<i>,</i>
it's not easy to "'be."'

709
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,021
Thank you.

710
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,423
Thank you<i>,</i> Dr. Cash.

711
00:56:05,995 --> 00:56:08,725
You would all just "'be."'

712
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:13,399
Excuse me<i>,</i> Heinz Asshole.
What are you doing?

713
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:20,107
I'm exercising my freedom of choice
and leaving.

714
00:56:20,643 --> 00:56:25,307
No<i>,</i> you don't understand. I was speaking
metaphorically not literally.

715
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,449
You see<i>,</i> freedom is very tricky.

716
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,780
Dr. Cash<i>,</i> I don't understand.

717
00:56:31,755 --> 00:56:35,213
On the one hand<i>,</i>
you tell us to make freedom our own...

718
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,826
but you prevent us
when we choose to do so.

719
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:44,697
This corruption of meaning
is like something I've heard about called...

720
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:47,333
Watergate.

721
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,309
Let's use it.

722
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,542
What can we learn from this?

723
00:56:57,647 --> 00:57:00,013
Dr. Cash<i>,</i> I have learned enough.

724
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,578
Now I must leave.

725
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,913
Heinz?

726
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:06,945
People...

727
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:09,181
take a look at Heinz.

728
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:13,561
Heinz<i>,</i> let them see a man...

729
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,023
who came here...

730
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,561
a man who changed here...

731
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:23,867
and a man who's now ready to leave here.

732
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:26,469
And why?

733
00:57:27,544 --> 00:57:29,307
Because he got it.

734
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,145
Let's give him a hand.

735
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:51,765
What idiots!

736
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,494
Oldest trick in the book!

737
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:06,841
<i>Thirty-seven minutes and counting</i>.

738
00:58:08,017 --> 00:58:11,180
- Honey.
- Honey.

739
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,286
<i>Qu pasa?</i>

740
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:19,057
- Hello<i>,</i> Bob and Jean.
- Hello.

741
00:58:19,128 --> 00:58:22,529
- I was just at the Being seminar.
- Funny<i>,</i> that's where we're going.

742
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:23,861
And I need your car.

743
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:29,200
Dr. Cash said that if I wanted something<i>,</i>
I should just take it.

744
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:34,365
Well<i>,</i> go ahead<i>,</i> by all means<i>,</i> take it.

745
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:39,546
- Think he'll bring it back?
- Honey<i>,</i> you know it's not about that.

746
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,057
You don't understand.
I must get to Liberty Park.

747
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,122
Hold your horses<i>,</i> babe.
We haven't even boogied yet.

748
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,226
Besides<i>,</i> I took the liberty
of entering us in the dance contest.

749
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:01,964
But there's no time.

750
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:15,883
Let's dance.

751
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:18,518
Now you're speaking my language.

752
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:26,992
Chanel-6 to Adam-11<i>,</i> imminent arrest at
the Starlight Discotheque<i>,</i> 15th and Main.

753
00:59:27,363 --> 00:59:29,354
Chris<i>,</i> Tommy<i>,</i> come here.

754
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,661
How far is 15th and Main?

755
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:39,435
You can't leave now. The fair is starting.
The Tetra-cell isn't even...

756
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:42,273
All right.
Just keep adding the tetrahydrozoline.

757
00:59:42,345 --> 00:59:45,041
When the Tetra-cell is full<i>,</i>
add the carbon dioxide.

758
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:49,608
Slowly at first. Then gradually increase it
until it starts to foam up<i>,</i> then seal it.

759
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,082
Wait. What was the first part again?

760
00:59:52,155 --> 00:59:54,453
Don't worry. I think I got it. Let's just go.

761
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:35,724
Why don't you go?

762
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:38,890
Because there's a line<i>,</i>
that's why I do not go.

763
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,235
You're obstructing my freedom of choice.

764
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,069
I'll obstruct your colon
if you don't shut up!

765
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:49,278
Fuck you!

766
01:01:02,191 --> 01:01:04,523
Please gather around<i>,</i> everybody.

767
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:09,124
Our own Chester McAndrew
will now demonstrate his project.

768
01:01:09,565 --> 01:01:12,728
Very appropriate for the Bicentennial<i>,</i>
I may say.

769
01:01:13,136 --> 01:01:16,936
A self-propelled<i>,</i> waving American flag.

770
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:18,702
Chester?

771
01:01:19,475 --> 01:01:20,737
- Why...
- Go ahead.

772
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,870
Why<i>,</i> in this modern age<i>,</i>
must we rely on the wind...

773
01:01:23,946 --> 01:01:26,141
to keep the flag looking good?

774
01:01:26,215 --> 01:01:29,582
I say<i>,</i> keep Old Glory
waving proudly all year 'round.

775
01:01:38,795 --> 01:01:40,160
Pretty good.

776
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:43,491
Thank you<i>,</i> Chester. Keep her going.

777
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:45,433
Look at that.

778
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:51,473
<i>Look at couple number one go</i>.
<i>Check them out</i>.

779
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:23,630
Ikiki Beach.

780
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,751
Bad housekeeping<i>,</i> paleface.

781
01:02:46,829 --> 01:02:48,820
One day<i>,</i> at this rate...

782
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:52,431
there won't be any beaches left
for you to look at.

783
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,103
How did you know?

784
01:02:56,038 --> 01:02:58,063
<i>Seven minutes and counting</i>.

785
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:06,343
Buddy<i>,</i> you honk at me one more time...

786
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:09,178
I'm gonna ram that Pacer up your ass!

787
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,945
All right! That does it!

788
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,919
Well<i>,</i> hello<i>,</i> Chris<i>,</i> Tommy.

789
01:03:53,563 --> 01:03:57,966
This is an unexpected entry<i>,</i> considering
you haven't been to class all summer.

790
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:02,530
We've been totally busy
working on our science project.

791
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,197
What exactly is it?

792
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,372
This year<i>,</i> Chris and myself...

793
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:11,913
will attempt to prove the theory of...

794
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,605
- Time travel.
- Right on.

795
01:04:14,350 --> 01:04:18,013
- Built yourself a time machine<i>,</i> have you?
- Exactly.

796
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:22,991
I'm sure we're all looking forward
to seeing whatever it is you've done.

797
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:27,760
That's great. Because we really
look forward to showing it to you.

798
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:30,125
We'll come back to you<i>,</i> okay?

799
01:04:31,334 --> 01:04:32,392
Next.

800
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:33,657
Over here<i>,</i> people.

801
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,195
<i>Five minutes and counting</i>.

802
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:42,741
<i>From Sandalwood City, couple three,</i>
<i>Jeff and Blanche Allman!</i>

803
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,245
What are you doing?

804
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:55,309
<i>Yowser! Disco dancing will never die!</i>

805
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,111
Adam-11.

806
01:05:59,221 --> 01:06:02,622
We really can't keep the future
of mankind waiting much longer.

807
01:06:02,692 --> 01:06:04,421
Who is this guy?

808
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,618
I believe we had a date.

809
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:09,293
Wait. Was it something I said?

810
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:15,203
- I'm really sorry. You're a terrific dancer.
- I've got her.

811
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:16,568
Come with us.

812
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:20,804
Let's go!

813
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:23,338
I'm sorry<i>,</i> Eddie.

814
01:06:37,059 --> 01:06:38,856
I'm right behind you.

815
01:06:46,402 --> 01:06:48,427
<i>Two minutes and counting</i>.

816
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:53,332
Next<i>,</i> a last-minute entry
from Chris Johnson and Tommy Sears.

817
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:57,436
Chris and Tommy will be demonstrating...
What is it again?

818
01:06:57,847 --> 01:06:59,906
It's kind of a time travel thing.

819
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:04,419
Actually<i>,</i> what this is<i>,</i>
this invention of ours<i>,</i> if you will...

820
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:08,880
which by the way is ours.
It belongs to no one else.

821
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:13,925
Exactly. This invention
belongs to Tommy and myself.

822
01:07:15,731 --> 01:07:17,164
<i>Two minutes</i>.

823
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:23,336
You forgive me? For what?

824
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,434
For those unkind things
you said about me before.

825
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:28,534
Just because you rescued me...

826
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:32,342
don't expect me to fall into your lap
like a damsel in distress.

827
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:46,160
Your problem is you just can't
face the fact that you love me.

828
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:50,096
- In love with you? I don't even like you.
- See<i>,</i> you're doing it now.

829
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:54,330
What is there to like about you?
You're arrogant<i>,</i> lazy and you're...

830
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:01,906
And what?

831
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,557
- Let's get out of here.
- You're the boss.

832
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:32,272
- You know something?
- What?

833
01:08:33,209 --> 01:08:35,939
I'm not getting paid enough
for this line of work.

834
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:38,009
I know what you mean.

835
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:40,682
Maybe there's something
in Administration.

836
01:08:40,749 --> 01:08:42,546
- You think so?
- What?

837
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:45,079
- That there is something there.
- Where?

838
01:08:45,154 --> 01:08:48,055
- In Administration.
- Why<i>,</i> did you hear about something?

839
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:51,424
<i>One minute and counting</i>.

840
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:03,237
So<i>,</i> with a common pharmaceutical
substance<i>,</i> tetrahydrozoline...

841
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:06,297
we were actually able to sort of...

842
01:09:06,375 --> 01:09:07,899
fix up the Lumis-Foil...

843
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,047
which<i>,</i> by the way<i>,</i> protects...

844
01:09:13,849 --> 01:09:16,613
the internal conduit controls.

845
01:09:21,824 --> 01:09:25,123
Which makes the transfer
of anti-matter through time...

846
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,725

847
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,924
Hey! Are we going to be tested on this?

848
01:09:31,167 --> 01:09:34,034
...<i>27, 26, 25</i>...

849
01:09:38,374 --> 01:09:41,832
And so any minute now<i>,</i>
you will be witnessing...

850
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:43,776
Chris<i>,</i> the Tetra-cell!

851
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:49,778
...<i>18, 17, 16</i>...

852
01:09:51,453 --> 01:09:54,752
Where were you? I don't know
how much longer we can stall them.

853
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:57,451
Wait<i>,</i> everybody!
We're going to have some time travel.

854
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,822
...<i>ten, nine, eight</i>...

855
01:10:02,464 --> 01:10:04,762
- Oh<i>,</i> no.
- What is it?

856
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:07,900
There's something wrong
with the Tetra-cell.

857
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,597
...<i>five, four</i>...

858
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:14,768
<i>three, two, one, zero</i>.

859
01:10:18,347 --> 01:10:19,439
Yes!

860
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:22,450
Something's happening!
People<i>,</i> come back! Wait!

861
01:10:23,786 --> 01:10:26,914
We've got a noise now.
It goes with the smoking Lumis-Foil.

862
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:30,618
What you're hearing now
is a highly futuristic engine sound...

863
01:10:30,993 --> 01:10:33,621
that means that everything is okay.

864
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:39,191
- Are we cool?
- Totally.

865
01:10:41,470 --> 01:10:44,166
It was really great having you guys here.

866
01:10:44,607 --> 01:10:48,543
You guys were the most exciting thing
to hit this town since Cal Jam.

867
01:10:49,144 --> 01:10:50,441
Thank you.

868
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,070
Take it easy.

869
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:03,082
Ladies and gentlemen!

870
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:04,621
America!

871
01:11:04,693 --> 01:11:08,185
Can I please have a round of applause
for America?

872
01:11:10,933 --> 01:11:14,869
For where else but in America
could two idiot kids like us...

873
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:19,029
invent a time travel ship
that looks like this!

874
01:11:21,610 --> 01:11:25,376
Ladies and gentlemen<i>,</i>
we give you time travel!

875
01:11:42,131 --> 01:11:44,895
Now that was science!

876
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:51,700
Did Chris and Tommy
ace the science fair or what?

877
01:11:52,374 --> 01:11:54,069
Totally!

878
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:06,605
Everyone look
at the upper left arm of your shirt...

879
01:13:06,915 --> 01:13:09,406
and try to follow along.

880
01:13:10,185 --> 01:13:12,813
"'We the People...

881
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:15,523
"'of the United States...

882
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,889
"'in order to form...

883
01:13:18,961 --> 01:13:22,158
"'a more perfect Union...

884
01:13:22,564 --> 01:13:24,623
"'establish Justice..."'

885
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,856
Look! It's Miss Liberty!

886
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:49,720
Hi<i>,</i> Miss Liberty!

887
01:14:01,203 --> 01:14:04,570
I think it's time we took that trip
to lkiki Beach.

888
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,914
Why leave?

889
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:26,250
"'... establish this Constitution...

890
01:14:26,361 --> 01:14:29,922
"'for the United States of America."'

891
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:02,218
Take three.

892
01:20:02,964 --> 01:20:04,090
And action!

893
01:20:05,066 --> 01:20:07,830
- Okay<i>,</i> what's this?
- Chewy-chocolate space food sticks...

894
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:10,769
went to the moon with the astronauts<i>,</i>
and they taste great.

895
01:20:11,907 --> 01:20:14,171
- And this?
- Ginsu knives that dice<i>,</i> slice...

896
01:20:14,242 --> 01:20:15,470
Even cuts through metal.

897
01:20:16,344 --> 01:20:17,368
What about this?

898
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:21,209
- Pringles<i>,</i> made from dried potatoes.
- Every one exactly the same.

899
01:20:23,084 --> 01:20:24,813
- How about this?
- Cup O' Noodles.

900
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:27,150
Just add water
and the noodles come to life.

901
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:30,782
- This?
- Spam!

902
01:20:33,962 --> 01:20:36,430
- It's a spray-paint can.
- But it's cheese.

903
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,628
Okay<i>,</i> how about this?

904
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,124
More Cup O' Noodles.

905
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:44,731
Help me!

906
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,755
