00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,040
[MAGICAL TWINKLING SOUND]
 Bella.

916
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,020
Donna.

917
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,440
I knew you'd come back.

918
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,270
You don't need us anymore.

919
00:53:25,270 --> 00:53:26,700
So we're going to leave you now.

920
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:27,590
Come on, you guys.

921
00:53:27,590 --> 00:53:28,810
I do need you.

922
00:53:28,810 --> 00:53:29,930
You're my friends.

923
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:31,410
Good bye, Mary Margaret.

924
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,780
You're scaring me.

925
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,140
It's getting hot.

926
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:35,840
Don't worry about us, child.

927
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,690
We enjoy a nice, hot bath.

928
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,810
Tansy, please.

929
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:47,720
Melilot, please help me.

931
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:59,180
Oh!

932
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:03,130
Poor Mary Margaret.

933
00:54:03,130 --> 00:54:05,100
Poor Mary Margaret.

934
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:28,250
People tea for your
 approval, Majesty.

935
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:33,790
Hmm--

936
00:54:37,170 --> 00:54:39,310
Problem, you're Quacktitude?

937
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:43,440
Not quite the people tea
 I remember from my girlhood.

938
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:47,230
But interesting nonetheless.

939
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:50,130
Drink, please, my loyal ones.

00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:18,810
What in heaven's name?

942
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:21,560
Mary Margaret
 was a sweet child.

943
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:25,440
But as a tea, she's
 a bit intoxicating.

944
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:27,360
No, I'm not.

945
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,320
Oh!

946
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,280
Mary Margaret!

947
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,720
Mary Margaret!

948
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,350
You're not [INAUDIBLE]
 intoxicating.

949
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:37,780
I'm not a tea.

950
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:38,800
My friends saved me.

951
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,470
What friends?

952
00:55:40,470 --> 00:55:43,590
You don't have any
 friends but Tansy and me.

953
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:47,680
Melilot claimed it wasn't
 our duty to save you.

954
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:48,560
I mean the pixies--

955
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:49,930
Bella and Donna.

956
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:54,180
Bella Donna-- why that's the
 name of a plant in our world.

957
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:56,180
A very powerful plant.

958
00:55:56,180 --> 00:55:57,590
One taste of it and you--

959
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:59,260
You get knocked out?

960
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,020
Yes.

961
00:56:02,020 --> 00:56:04,510
How did you know that?

00:56:04,510 --> 00:56:07,500
Oh, I see--

963
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,740
Well, we must move quickly.

964
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:13,030
The effect won't last long.

965
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:15,480
And Dragora still
 as the berries.

966
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,110
Get your [INAUDIBLE]
 off my berries!

968
00:57:07,970 --> 00:57:10,530
This is amazing.

969

A once in a lifetime opportunity
 to test our [INAUDIBLE]..

We've been working for.

971
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,870
I don't care
 about that, Tuttle.

972
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:21,240
I just want my daughter back.

973
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:23,200
Yes, yes, of course.

974
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,070
But there's nothing
 wrong with winning

975
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:27,370
the Nobel Prize in the process.

976
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,010
Oh, Gilbert,
 stand back, honey.

977
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:36,660
Something about
 one berry here.

978
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:38,220
I beg your pardon.

979
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:42,030
Oh, an old poem.

980
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:44,010
I see.

00:57:44,010 --> 00:57:46,540
Let's get to
 work here, Tuttle.

982

Anti-matter the generator 10%.

You guys really think
 this is gonna work?

985
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,340
I will stake my
 reputation on it.

986
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,310
Remember, Swanston, our
 very first cup of people tea.

987
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:10,700
What was that
 people's name again?

988
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:14,500
Oh, your
 [INAUDIBLE],, earl grey.

989
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,730
Yes, that's it.

990
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:19,650

 is this way, isn't it?

991
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,930
Excellent navigational
 skill, Majesty.

992
00:59:01,890 --> 00:59:03,750
Don't make any
 sudden movements.

993
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:06,000
And don't curtsy, just kneel.

994
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,400
And wait till your
 turn to speak.

995
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,810
Don't-- don't laugh.

996
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:10,680
Don't smile.

00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:13,740
And don't defy her.

999

Just be yourself.

1000

 Melilot, Your Majesty.

00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,890

I regret to report
 that we have an--

1004
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:03,810
an unfortunate disruption
 between the two realms.

1005
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,630
A mirror has been violated?

1006
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:00:10,110 --> 01:00:12,500
And two mirror
 berries have fallen

1008
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,170
into the hands of Dragora--

1009
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:16,230
have they not?

1010
01:00:16,230 --> 01:00:20,650
Well, in a way, Your Majesty.

1011
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:26,810
And this people child
 is responsible I presume?

1012
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:28,240
Let me just say
 that it was my fault.

1013
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,740
Silence.

1014
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:35,150
I have no ear for
 pathetic excuses.

1015
01:00:35,150 --> 01:00:38,800
You should have brought this
 to my attention immediately.

 I was not sleeping.

You are a very

You can't do that.

It's not fair.

You didn't even listen
 to what happened.

 listen to anything.

 opinion, you're not

much better than queen Dragora.

Tansy and Melilot
 are not people.

 have them as your subjects.

 bargain with you.

1075
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:38,980
What kind of bargain?

If you do as I ask, I
 shall pardon your friends.

 Melilot and Tansy free.

I want to go home.

But Your Majesty, we
 don't have any more mirror

Dragora dropped these
 as she went flying past.

I believe you know
 how to use them.

Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.

 this people child,

Very well then, I'm off.

I thought that we'd
 lost you in there.

Mom saved me.

She was great.

Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

It's OK.

1302
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:40,930
Every time I look in the

 worry about that anymore.

 an eye out anyway.
