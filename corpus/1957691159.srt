How do you steal nuclear missiles?

Had to have been an inside job.
You can't just walk in...

186
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,375
Doesn't matter how they did it.
What matters is those missiles are mobile.

187

They can hide their nukes anywhere.

So, Captain, seems as though
you and I are at an impasse

because I need
to disable your command center

316

so my people in Russia
can fire those missiles.

And you need to keep me out.

00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,458
But, full disclosure,

319
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:19,125
I have contained or killed
everyone else on this vessel,

320
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:21,041

00:41:08,791 --> 00:41:09,708
<i>I'm here.</i>

721
00:41:10,333 --> 00:41:12,291
<i>If you launch even one of those missiles,</i>

722
00:41:12,375 --> 00:41:15,583
{\an8}<i>I swear before God
that we will hunt you down</i>

723

{\an8}<i>and wipe you from existence.</i>

724
00:41:17,583 --> 00:41:20,625
<i>That's enough. You're boring me.</i>

725
00:41:21,375 --> 00:41:23,125

727
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:27,416
My fellow Americans,

728
00:41:28,708 --> 00:41:31,750
I am Alexander Kessel,

729
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,500
son of trust fund billionaire,
Alexander Kessel Senior,

730
00:41:36,583 --> 00:41:38,541
who you may also know

731
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:46,208
is the current utterly unqualified
US ambassador to the United Nations.

732
00:41:46,291 --> 00:41:48,166
[tense music builds]

733
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:53,125
Now, my associates in Russia
control 16 nuclear missiles,

734
00:41:53,208 --> 00:41:56,666
<i>and I control
the only interceptor missiles</i>

735
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,791
<i>that are capable of stopping them.</i>

736
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,791
Sixteen American cities
have been targeted.

737
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:06,791
300 million of you will die.

738
00:42:07,666 --> 00:42:11,000
One city will be destroyed first

739
00:42:11,666 --> 00:42:14,500
so that the rest of you
can watch in horror.

740
00:42:15,958 --> 00:42:17,375
Missile team one…

741
00:42:18,833 --> 00:42:19,750
Fire.

{\an8}<i>Intercept launch expires in 12 minutes.</i>

745
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:37,791
[Kessel] Now in 12 minutes,
that missile I just launched,

746
00:42:37,875 --> 00:42:39,666
will pass over my head,

747
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:43,708
at which point, it will be too late
for this interceptor to catch it.

748
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,875
But which city has been chosen?

749
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,250
Is it yours?

750
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,666
Wherever it lands, there's no time to run.

751
00:42:56,291 --> 00:42:57,583
You can't flee.

752
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:01,708
If you guessed Los Angeles,

753
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:04,291
congratulations.

754
00:43:05,166 --> 00:43:07,875
<i>The City of Angels
has 23 minutes left to live.</i>

755
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:08,916
[panicked chatter]

756
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,833
Wait a second.

757
00:43:09,916 --> 00:43:11,875
<i>Once Los Angeles is gone,</i>

758
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:14,916
<i>And the fear of every American
is at its peak…</i>

759
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,291
We're not closing yet.

760
00:43:16,375 --> 00:43:18,416
<i>…I will launch a second wave</i>

761
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,208

762
00:43:20,291 --> 00:43:22,875

Philadelphia, Miami, New York.

765
00:43:32,458 --> 00:43:35,666
And of course, Washington DC.

[tense music builds]

767
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:39,916
Today…

768
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:43,333
America dies

769
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:45,958
in a paroxysm of fear.

770
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,500
<i>America is the greatest lie ever told.</i>

771
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:00,958
<i>American exceptionalism?</i>

772
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:01,958
Maybe once.

773
00:44:03,583 --> 00:44:05,541
When the founders got rid of kings.

774
00:44:07,166 --> 00:44:09,500
When they declared
that all men are created equal.

775
00:44:09,583 --> 00:44:12,541
Now they say ours are United States,
but when was that true?

776
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:14,458
<i>Was it true during the Civil War?</i>

777
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,416
<i>Or Jim Crow?</i>

778
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,041
Hell, is it true now?

779
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,958
You know, this national lie,

780
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,166
it's a festering wound,

781
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:25,791
and it's fatal.

782
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:28,250
There's no Band-Aid to patch it.

783
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,000
No, the only way to save our nation
and the promise it once held

784
00:44:34,083 --> 00:44:35,708
is to erase it.

785
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,833
Start over.

786
00:44:37,916 --> 00:44:39,083
So maybe then.

787
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:42,458
{\an8}When we are staring at each other

788
00:44:42,541 --> 00:44:44,125

789
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:48,541
we will all agree that this time

790
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:51,958
we're going to get America right.

791
00:44:57,666 --> 00:44:59,666
This is Corporal Rahul Shah.

793
00:45:01,958 --> 00:45:03,291

794
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:05,458

797

You've never been mocked for your faith?

798
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:15,791
Never been the subject
to enhanced screenings at airports?

why you're obsessed with missiles.</i>

802
00:45:29,875 --> 00:45:31,041
Pathetic.

816
00:46:18,791 --> 00:46:22,166
put out a bounty hunt on photos like this.

Hey, did you hear that?
It's a setback. That's cool.

She shot the goddamn missile
out of the sky!

907

It's one missile. There are 15 left.

908
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:10,125

if she shoots them down too, huh?

909

on attempted nuking?

You know, growing up, I never summered
where I wintered. [chuckles]

I'm not complaining.

I was the product of a failed society.

A society that consistently rewards money
and ignores everything else.

1016

What? You think my father
became ambassador to the UN

1017
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:48,291
because of any
worthwhile diplomatic skills

1018
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:50,375
or because of his political donations?

1019
00:57:50,958 --> 00:57:53,000
See, that's what we do in America.

1020
00:57:53,083 --> 00:57:56,791
We just figure because someone's rich
that means they're smart.

My father's a moron.

1022

He inherited his money.

1023

- He didn't earn it.
- God.

1024

The best.

He served too, didn't he?

Thirty-six years.

[Kessel] That's how he met your mom?
When he was stationed in Spain?

1032

Does he still hang out
with his army buddies?

1033
00:58:27,125 --> 00:58:28,291

This is what I was trained for.
Psy ops. Military intelligence.

1254
01:08:58,541 --> 01:09:01,125
Oh, fuck him. He ruined my family's name!

1255
01:09:01,958 --> 01:09:04,125
Today I restore it
with dignity and respect.

1256
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:07,875
[Collins] Bullshit. I saw your file.

1257
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:10,333
You're just a total fucking psycho.

1259
01:09:12,041 --> 01:09:13,958
- Thank you.
- [Kessel] For what?

1260
01:09:14,791 --> 01:09:18,041
- [Collins] For showing me your weakness.
- Oh, yeah. What's that?

1261
01:09:18,125 --> 01:09:19,958
[Collins]
You want to get out of here alive.

1262
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:23,000
[Kessel] You know what else I want?
I want to hurt you, JJ.

1263
01:09:23,083 --> 01:09:26,041
I want to cut off your fingers.
I want you to beg me to kill you!

1264

1269
01:09:40,833 --> 01:09:42,791
Well, that's not fast enough.

1270
01:09:43,625 --> 01:09:45,958
This rig is going to sink in 15 minutes.

1271
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,500
And the second it goes under,

1272
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:49,500
these assholes
will launch all their nukes.

1273
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,916

1276
01:09:57,875 --> 01:09:59,291
I sort of have this plan.

1277
01:09:59,833 --> 01:10:03,166
- But it's a little counter intuitive.
- [President] <i>Let's hear it, Captain.</i>

1278
01:10:04,750 --> 01:10:06,541
I let them take the command center.

1279
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:09,166
<i>What? That's precisely
what we don't want to happen.</i>

1280
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:12,625
This rig is going down,
and when it sinks, they win.

1281
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,166
We have to force them
to fire the missiles before that happens.

1282
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,583
<i>And then what?</i>

1283
01:10:17,666 --> 01:10:20,458
And then I retake the command center

1284
01:10:20,541 --> 01:10:22,041
and intercept their nukes.

1285
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,500

1293
01:10:37,625 --> 01:10:40,583

has a 14% chance of success.</i>

1294

Listen, genius. You're saying
my plan is running at 14%?

1304
01:11:07,125 --> 01:11:08,541
Yours is zero!

1305
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:12,375
You haven't been beat up, strangled,
or shot defending this rig today.

1306
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:15,333
So I think you'll find
I'm kind of fucking motivated here.
