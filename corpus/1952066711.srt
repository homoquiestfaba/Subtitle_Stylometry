1
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:25,770
Once upon a time ...
in the Kingdom of Hauptmann Koenig

2
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,320
Come here.

3
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:52,590
I love you.

4
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,430
Jesse!

5
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,760
I missed you.

6
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,570
More!

7
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:22,070
Again!

8
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,480
What will you do with me now, sir?

9
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:31,090
Find a priest, take a house
and live happily ever after.

10
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:32,650
But what about your mother?

11
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,540
You know how she feels
about mixed marriages!

12
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:38,040
By sunset we'll
be man and wife.

13
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:41,230
and the queen, bless her soul,
will be out my life.

14
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,370
He's comming!
He's comming!

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,260
Go!

16
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:04,960
Everybody!

17
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,780
Take another side!

18
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,070
Stand back!

19
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,670
Make place!
I am the prince!

20
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,840
We are here on
queen's business.

21
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,340
We have orders to arrest
your peasant girl.

22
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,920
Over my dead body.

23
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:33,410
Do not draw that sword unless
you intend to use it, sir.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,230
I think he means it.

25
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,210
Sir, I would it in private.

26
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:46,770
We soldiers are working
on a queen business.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,250
Can't you try yo see things...

28
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,650
Unhang her!

29
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:54,610
Here you got!

30
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,370
My Prince!

31
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,610
Jesse!

32
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,780
I love you!

33
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,930
I love you!

34
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:14,920
My prince!
- Jesse!

35
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,080
William!

36
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,580
Queen!
The Queen!

37
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,530
Stop picking those soldiers

38
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,380
and get away from that peasant girl!

39
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,640
To the ground, you
scamming trolls!

40
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,040
I love her mother,
I will always love her.

41
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,520
He's still my son.
She's only after the royal jewels.

42
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,250
You know she's not our tipe.

43
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,170
Come home with me and we'll
discuss over some mutton.

44
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,260
Give her the gift.

45
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,690
Well, my little sweety pie,...

46
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,750
I don't want gold,
or your jewels.

47
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:59,150
Get out of the way.

48
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,960
No. But I have gold and jewels.

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,920
Jesse!

50
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:08,210
Let us make this.

51
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,710
A simbol of our eternal love.

52
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:14,150
Then I will wear it forever.

53
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,150
You have cursed my gift.

54
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,350
It's not me, darling.
It's the work of Spretzzel.

55
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,160
Brilliant.
Simply brilliant.

56
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,390
Frozen forever.

57
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,240
Other curse was nothing, my queen.
Nothing know nothing.

58
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
Mother, I have never
asked you for anything.

59
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,330
I beseak you to take my life
and spare hers.

60
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
Rights. You're such a romantic!

61
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:50,710
A thousand years or...

62
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,240
until she meets a true love
from another land.

63
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,050
Only then can the curse in
necklace be removed.

64
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,420
No!

65
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,590
Is it a deal?

66
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:07,340
Yes, but you have cursed
your kingdom

67
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,690
for a thousand years!

68
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,910
HAUPTMAN KOENIG - 1000 YEARS LATER

69
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,680
...ALMOST

70
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,180
...and Still Raining

71
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:39,750
And that is the legend of Hauptmann
Koening enchanted peasant girl.

72
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,930
Of course, nobody really
believes the Legend.

73
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,560
Now, if you step this way,

74
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,840
I'll show you a famous collection
of umbrellas through history.

75
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,520
Is it true the statues
are going on tour?

76
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Yes.

77
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,760
Nobody...

78
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,260
...really believe...

79
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,860
...the Legend?

80
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,250
My great,...

81
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400

That's me.

93
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,040
PHILADELPHIA, A FEW DAYS LATER

94
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,720

Here, sign this.

119
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,890
I am at Akermans security.
I don't miss much.

120
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Hi, I'm Jason Williams.

121
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:20,720
I guess, I am wondering what
I am doing with the stiring wheel.

122
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:21,810
Stiring wheel?

123
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,770
Oh, that, umm...

124
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,080
Nice, soon it was key chain.

126
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,330
Just don't want
my jeep stolen.

127
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,130
You don't have to worry
about that with me around here.

128
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,650
Is it hair spray?
- Yeah, well a sort of Flant Maisson class.

00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,150
Oh, then I -

00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,410
Then you're blind...

131
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:47,090
Don't loose this, baby.

132
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,050
You can charge anything

00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:04,690
That's impossible, sir.
- Nothing is impossible.

141
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:07,170
Impossible - is a dirty,
dirty word.

142
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,960
Dust.
- Pardon me?

143

144
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,260

00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:29,960

That's him up there.

153
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:47,870

00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,490

184
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,230
Stop! Swing!

185
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,140
Do you remember
Miss Diana Ross

186
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,660
in the movie "Mahagony"?

187
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,590
Yeah?

188
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,530
Give me chick bones.

189
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,070
All give me deaf.

190
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,300
5 .. 6 .. 7 .. 8.

191
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,950
Mr. James is comming!
Mr. James is comming!

192
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:01,060
Scatter!
Bring down the curtains!

193
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,720
Montrows! Montrows!
I need to talk to you!

194
00:14:13,890 --> 00:14:16,390
The Wizard's not here.
Go away. Go away.

195
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:18,890
Montrows!

196
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,390
Let me joke and kidding.

197
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:24,140
I'd like you to meet
a new assistant.

198
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
What happened
to Albert?

199
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,730
Albert, was a blemish on the face
in "Prince & comp." I fired him.

200
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,700
Just like you did to those
18 other assistents?

201
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,310
Guess its' not use of worring about
fashion plan around here, ha?

202
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,100
Ha, ha, ha! He's got a
sence of humor.

203
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,570
I like it. We can use
it around here.

204
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:44,780
No pickin'.

205
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,120
Why won't you let me see it?
- Because I'm an artist.

206
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,790
You wouldn't want to interrupt
the creative flow, won't you?

207
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Montrows, this show...

208
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,750
will be elegant
and emule.

209
00:14:57,930 --> 00:14:59,930
Got it? No crazy stuff.

210
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,080
You have my word.

211
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,440
Fine.

212
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,790
The pursuit of excellence,
beginns with elegance.

213
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,390
The pursuit of excellence,
beginns with elegance.

214
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:14,830
I haven't been elegant and emule
since I graduated from finishing school.

215
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Antre!

216
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,970
She's pretty.

217
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
What is over enchanted
peasant girls stuff?

218
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,760
Oh, it's tipical old world tale.

219
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,390
Girl meets Prince.

220
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:32,910
Evil sorcerer turns girl into
wood for thousend years,

221
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,260
Lord knows how. Wouldn't go
becomes major turist attracts you?

222
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:38,950
Nah. It's pretty difficult already.

223
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:40,990
Would you like to try our new fragrances?
- No, thanks.

224
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,160
Tabue. A mysterious.

225
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,640
Hit me again Gale.

226
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:51,390
You never buy Hollywood.
- No, that is because I'm constantly evolving.

227
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:53,370
Put it right here Jason.

228
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,830
How about a gift for your girlfriend?

229
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,530
Oh, I don't have one.

230
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,180
So, you're looking?

231
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,900
Umm, for true love?
Yeah. Sure.

232
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,320
True love is like the Loch Ness monster.

233
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,780
Everyone has heard of it but
noone has ever seen it.

234
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,830
I have.

235
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,590
I don't know I think its some out there
for everyone.

236
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:12,960
I couldn't agree more.

237
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:15,830
You just have to follow your heart.

238
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,990
And your nose.

239
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,640
Oh, my, my, my...
Are we little coquette?

240
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:24,560
Forgive me if I'm wrong, but Jason,
I think that if you ask Gale out,

241
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,320
she will probably say yes.
Am I halucinating Gale?

242
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:30,570
Excuse me, I am beeping.

243
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:33,180
Pardon-moi.
Put it right there, Jason.

244
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:39,120
Well...I...am free at Friday, Jason.

245
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,570
I am free too Gale.

246
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
Oh. Oh, I've rushed it.

247
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,440
I mean, looks like we are gonna
working here together, why don't just...

248
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:50,050
you know...
- Something terrible has happened.

249
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,070
The enchanted peasant girl
has been in an accident.

250
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,340
Come on, we must go.
Follow me.

251
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,420
Move yor butts.

252
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,570
Still free at Friday.

253
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,280
My little deeping top dare
earing is gonna be slaying

254
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,680
if anything happens to that statue, those
clothes or the royal jewels.

255
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,270
I am sure everything
is gonna be fine.

256
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,250
Oh just talk about the jewels ..

257
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:13,250
I have these beads
and baubles...

258
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,720
My men took all fame.

259
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,510
souvenirs from all Mr-s
"Left behind Hollywood".

260
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,090
Always just so cheap and country.

261
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,960
Well, at least they thought enough
of you to give you the gifts.

262
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,460
I bought them myself!

263
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,920
Someone please, kill me!

264
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,930
I dont want to live.

265
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Breath or something.
-Jesus!

266
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,990
The whole thing is gonna fall.

267
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:55,990
Get outta the track!
- Be carefull!

268
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:59,080
The girl will the fall out.
We must secure the doors.

269
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:03,000
All my years on the forsight, I've never seen
somebody so stupid then you guys.

270
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,800
The signs read, keep right.

271
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,030
To end of the bridge!

272
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,640
Where the street is.

273
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,260
But, the peasant girl!
- You gotta go. Get out!

274
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Nooooo!

275
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,540
The girl!!!!!!

276
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,330
I'll save you.

277
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,330
Sure is not dead.

278
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:30,420
Where is Jacques Cousteau
when you need him!

279
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,510
Get to our! She is ours!
- Take it.

280
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,440
There are you!

281
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,630
Don't you ever touch the
enchanted peasant girl!

282
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,020
Oh my hero!

283
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,760
You saved the presentation
and my ebony ass.

284
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,760
I could swore she was real.

285
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,010
She is a mannequin!

286
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,620
I swore she was real.

287
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,790
She is the enchanted
peasant girl.

288
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,480
Let me guess.

289
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,810
You must be the boys from
Hauptman Koenig?

290
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:44,130
My, haven't even steroides.

291
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,810
We are to guard our
national treasure.

292
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,860
And do the fabulous job.

293
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:52,150
Did you take the rest of wardrobe?

294
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:55,440
I thought Taylor did.
- I thought you did.

295
00:19:55,710 --> 00:19:57,710
Noooooooooo!

296
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:00,710
Bye, boys.

297
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,030
Jason, let's take the mannequin
back to the store.

298
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,280
Yeah. We wouldn't wanna her
to catch the cold.

299
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,660
They're so dump.

300
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,520
I just love that in a man.

301
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:14,720
This is the strangest thing
that's ever happened to me.

302
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:16,740
Believe me, stranger things
have happened.

303
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,480
Yeah. But not to me
they happen.

304
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,980
Are you think these
jewels are real?

305
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,610
Honey, this little country
girl knows jewels,

306
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,610
And believe me,
those are real.

307
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,650
It's your fault!

308
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,760
No! It's your fault!

309
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,260
We have to catch the ride!

310
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,520
I know how! Hey! Look!

311
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,190
I don't believe this!
I don't believe it!

312
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:58,880
Wow! Hey!

313
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:01,710
Alright!

314
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,660
Yeah! Get in! Get in!

315
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,430
I told you it will work!

316
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:14,370
They come up!

317
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:20,110
Its all your fault!
Its all your fault!

318
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,290
You got my note?
Yes, Andy.

319
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,370
I've got it.
- Well?

320
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,390
Look, you're very sweet

321
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
but you can't buy
my car insurance.

322
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,210
Why not?

323
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,710
Andy, can I give you
a little tip?

324
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,210
Car insurance is
not very romantic.

325
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,690
Say that after major
injury accident.

326
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:45,500
Andy, lets just leave that

327
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:46,820
we're friends.

328
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,260
Really?
What kind of friends?

329
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,070
The kind, that we
don't talk too much,

330
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,690
and never go out.

331
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,140
Excuse me.
Just one sec...

332
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,040
You boys've been playing in
kitty litter.

333
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,720
No! We are right from
garbage track.

334
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:22,220
Have you seen the enchanted
peasant girl?

335
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:25,500
No. But you can imagine
me in different offer.

336
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Ja. Come on! We have to find her.

337
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:29,980
Here. Have a little.

338
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,280
That's nice.

339
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,350
We have to get ourselfs
a new cloth.

340
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,820
Ja, we do stink.

341
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,300
Why do you so nervous?
You're made for each other.

342
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:44,160
Estell, this is Clark.

343
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:02,660
I command you to come to life!

344
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,830
I must be crazy.

345
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,080
Oh, yeah.

346
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:30,200
Here is definitely something
wrong with me.

347
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,120
1.5 billion women in the world

348
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,150
and I'm trying to score with the statue .

349
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,890
Gesundheit!
- Danke schon.

350
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,070
You're welcome.

351
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:47,570
My Prince!
Stay...stay back!

352
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,620
Why are you running?

353
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,640
Why am i run...
Why are you moving?!

354
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,890
Why she...gosh!

355
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,820
I saw you in the water and
in the wass-wagon.

356
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,320
Water - that's it!

357
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,450
It was the toxins in the river.

358
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,950
They - do strange
things to a brain.

359
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,450
Prince, why are
you doing this?

360
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,320
You've lost your memory?

361
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,050
It is a dream!

362
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:15,998
It is I. Jesse, your true love.

363
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,310
You are real?

364
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,360
Of course, I am.

365
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,590
You're beginning
to frighten me.

366
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,480
When was the last time
we saw each other. I mean,

367
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,500
before little swimming today?

368
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Just a few minutes ago
on the bridge.

369
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:34,900
What bridge?

370
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,790
The one out of the castle.
We were under way to be married.

371
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,030
Don't remember the soldiers
and the sorcerer?

372
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,090
Legend is true!

373
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,400
What legend?

374
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:49,500
Umm, that sorcerer guy,

375
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:52,130
he put a curse on you.

376
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:56,320
You've...been frozen
for thousend years.

377
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,300
Oh, my Prince William's always joking.
- Yeah.

378
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,340
I'm not kidding.
This is 20th Century.

379
00:25:10,650 --> 00:25:12,650
20th?
- Yeah. Umm...

380
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:14,360
Look!

381
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:18,070
Bet you've never seen one
of these before?

382
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,250
Sure I have.
Those are jester shoes.

383
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,360
Jester shoes...

384
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,420
Ummm, hey!

385
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,860
How 'bout one of these?
- No. I'm not sure.

386
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:36,130
I guess, she's real.

387
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:38,170
Anything?
- Nothing.

388
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:41,690
The Count will have us
in tar and feather.

389
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,370
Yes.

390
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:45,770
Then he will torture us.

391
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,510
Hi.

392
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,280
No no no no.
Just lie still.

393
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,650
You're ok?

394
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,150
I love you.

395
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
I am Jason
Williamson.

396
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,070
of german town P.A.
I am not the prince.

397
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,100
I don't care.
Still live you.

398
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,810
You're still in the shock.
Forever and ever...

399
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:15,310
I don't even know you.

400
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,250
Yes you do..

401
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,270
You just haven't realized yet.

402
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,660
You really do love me, don't you?

403
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,040
More then anyone is going
to in your whole life.

404
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,320
It's you.

405
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
Who is that?
- What is this place?

406
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,360
It's him.

407
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,870
The guy from the river.

408
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:39,120
What have you done with
the enchanted peasant girl?

409
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,720
You guys are not suppose
to be back in here.

410
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,050
I'm gonna have to call the security.

411
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:44,370
There she is.

412
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:49,150
That was the close one.

413
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,650
Not a word of this
to the Count.

414
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
We don't want to get him upset.

415
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,860
Ja, ja, ja. If we don't go to the airport,
to greet him, he will be upset.

416
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,120
Guys, you know...

417
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,010
You...She's just gonna be ok here.

418
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
I mean, we lock this
up at night, and

419
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:08,160
it's very safe.
- Ok, good. Lets go!

420
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,190
Lovely fellow.

421
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,470
Hey.

422
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,230
Who were they?

423
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:26,250
DON'T do that anymore.

424
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,220
What did they want with me?

425
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,900
You're a national treasure.
Those are your personal guards.

426
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,980
I don't like them very much.

427
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,520
Whats that noise?

428
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,880
It's my stomach.

429
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,210
I haven't eaten for thousend years.

430
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,350
Come one, I know great place
near where we can go to eat.

431
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,510
Oh, good. Do they
have boiled weasel?

432
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,430
You won't be able to tell
the difference.

433
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:56,120
And first thing we need to do is
get you something to wear.

434
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,620
Do you remember this?

435
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,420
Sure. It's your necklace.

436
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,010
Right.

437
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:10,030
Hello! Hello!

438
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,300
So much fun!

439
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,900
The lights are beautiful!

440
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,310
Little person blinky,
then you can walk?

441
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:23,560
Wow!

442
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:26,590
I love car! I love electricity!

443
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,690
I love America!
How does it all work?

444
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:30,960
Well,...

445
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,320
thats gonna take a little
longer to explain.

446
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:44,220
Here you go...

447
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,620
So?

448
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:55,060
What do you think?
Is it better then weasel?

449
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:58,080
It's not as salty, but it's good.

450
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,380
It's best meal I had
in a thousend years.

451
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:03,380
I will probably stay with
you in other thousend too.

452
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,880
What's the crunchy stuff?

453
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,320
Not suppose to be
any crunchy stuff.

454
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:12,080
It's a paper.

455
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,900
You..you're eating the wrapper.
You don't need to chaw white stuff.

456
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,570
It's good.Try it.
- No.

457
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,460
Thanks.

458
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Listen. You, know, gonna
need the place to stay.

459
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,840
I was thinking, you are welcome
to stay at my house, really.

460
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,820
I mean, no catch. You'll need
adress for Green Card, for job or...

461
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:34,250
What do you like to do?

462
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:37,070
Well, at first,..

463
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,210
I wanted to be shepherd.

464
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:41,210
Then, everytime i got the sheep,

465
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,200
I was sneezed.

466
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,850
So, then I tried weaving.

467
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:46,030
And I can read,
in entire blanket.

468
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,200
In 17 months.

469
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:50,180
No!
- That's pretty fast.

470
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:51,660
That's amazing!

471
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,850
Can I ask you something?

472
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,650
Sure.

473
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:58,610
Are you betroth?

474
00:30:00,470 --> 00:30:01,590
Betroth?

475
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:04,530
Well, I was gonna tell you.

476
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,780
There is someone
I've been seeing.

477
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,220
I will introduce to you, ok?

478
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,560
Harriette? Harriette, this is Jesse.

479
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:15,560
Jesse, this is Harriette, please.
Don't embarrace me.

480
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,730
No, No!

481
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:19,790
It's not what you are thinking.

482
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,560
You are so suspicious.

483
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:23,630
She is terrible.

484
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,520
No. I'm...I'm...

485
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,920
not betroth to anybody.

486
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,040
Allright, people!

487
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:35,460

00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Why? What are you look at?

503
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,700
Nothing! Absolutely.

504
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,710

505
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:51,360

Here.

509
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Count Sprietzzel,...

510
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,400
Spretzzel.

511
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,380
Pretty. May I present
Hollywood Montrows,

512
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:11,610
our chief of visual merchandising
and an artist in ever sence of the word.

513
00:32:11,710 --> 00:32:14,690
He, is the gentlemen,
who is in charge of display.

514
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,590
Did he put
with his hands

515
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:19,780
on my statue?

516
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,480
Listen. Have you ever thought
about putting a few african beads

517
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:26,320
It would be
absolutely smashing.

518
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Just a suggestion.

519
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,990
Count Spretzzel, I think
you'll be pleased,

520
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,220
at our handling
of your presentation.

521
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,560
Good.

522
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:37,820
Are you promise, that this will
bring a tension to my country?

523
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,210
National publicity?
- Good.

524
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,710
Because my tourism, you know...
Income is down slightly.

525
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,810
We,...I don't know,
we cross maybe,..umm

527
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,950
We would like to get addapt to maybe,
I don't know, 3 digits next time.

528
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:54,470
Why do not charge it?
Just see that face.

529
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:56,570
What did he say?

530
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,950
He said, he has such
admiration for you grace.

531
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,220
Well, that's ok.

00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:54,630
Climb up this place.

Hello, beauty.

00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:26,020
Are you a general? - I'm another
republic. You wanna dance, baby?

619
00:38:25,990 --> 00:38:27,990
I already have a man.

620
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
Come on! Move your feet!

621
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,860
Ok.

622
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:39,600
That's it.

623
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Are you under
some kind of spell?

624
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:47,770
Come on Jesse. Follow me.
- I am trying.

625
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:03,070
Wait! Wait!

626
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:06,940
That's not dancing!
That's not dancing!

627
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,940
This is dancing.

628
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:59,100
I've danced alone
thousend of times,

629
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:05,840
to songs that noone
else could even hear

630
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:12,550
I've reached
to the flame of love

631
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:19,970
I couldn't hold it,
and disappeared

632
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:24,530
I have lived to learn
to hate the blues

633
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:31,670
I lived with everything,
but you

634
00:40:31,890 --> 00:40:37,930
I can not believe my eyes
I see you here!

635
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,300
Now, are you
comfortable?

636
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:46,690
I am as comfortable as can be
in front of a camera .

637
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:49,130
Come on. You are not
at national television.

638
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,020
This is just your own personal
dating video cassette.

639
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:57,450
Now! Relax! We are rolling. Ok.
What is your name?

00:40:57,950 --> 00:41:02,060

Now. Tell me what is the most exciting
thing that ever happened to you.

645
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,580
That would be knee surgery.

646
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,240
You know, I think we should
take a different track.

647
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:46,150
Is this your cotage?
- Yeah.

648
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,530
Your mother must be
very wealthy lady.

649
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,860
Well, that's a matter of fact.
She has her own business. But...

650
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,920
We don't want to
discuss it here, ok?

651
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,420
Just...be very quiet.

652
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,520
Here is our dating dossier.

653
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:10,820

Well, it wouldn't be end of the world
if you stay here.

659
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:26,680
This is a perfectly nice...
normal home.

660
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,350
Mom. I'm a big boy now.
I need to be on my own. Ok?

661
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,940
Good night.

662
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:40,770
What are you doing?

663
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:44,670
I've...change my mind.
I made terrible mistake.

664
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,860
You don't know me.
I've never been here.

665
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:49,950
You've never seen me.

666
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,890
I've never, ever been.
I'm sorry.

667
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:57,980
Here some...$10...cassette.
I'll pay that. Send me the bill.

668
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,870
This is a palace.

669
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
I love the 20th Century!

670
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:22,710
The painting is so real.

671
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:26,130
It must have been done
by an great artist.

672
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,950
It's a snap shoot.

673
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Taken by uncle Bob.
That's my dad.

674
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:36,380
He - passed away after
that was taken.

675
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:40,150
You both have the same smile.

676
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,080
Wish I have the snap shoot
of my family.

677
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,980
I miss 'em so much.

678
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,950
Yeah.

679
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,450
I know what you mean.

680
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,730
You know, sometimes,
I can picture myself.

681
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:03,400
Back in your time. Prince.

682
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,360
Alone in a strange land,
armed only with my sword,

683
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,120
taking on the world for a...

684
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
Heh, just a fantasy.

685
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,830
No, you are a prince.

686
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:19,600
As great and valiant
as ever were.

687
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,860
So glad I'm not
alone anymore.

688
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,360
Never gonna leave you alone.

689
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,300
Good night.

690
00:46:08,350 --> 00:46:10,840
You are cooking?
Whats the occasion?

691
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,560
I am hungry.
- Aha.

692
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,530
And, by the way..
who's in the bathroom?

693
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:18,580
Friend. No questions, please.

694
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,610
I always respect your
privacy.

695
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,190
Did you sleep with this friend?
- No I slept on the coutch, thank you.

696
00:46:24,350 --> 00:46:26,670
And mom, thanks for
respecting my privacy.

697
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:30,120
No problem. Where did you meet her.
- At work.

698
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,600
She's a model,...

699
00:46:32,670 --> 00:46:35,600
Ummm...foreign.
I think from...Bavaria.

700
00:46:35,630 --> 00:46:39,210
Bavaria? Me and your father always
had a royal Bavarian blood.

701
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:41,920
Of course, he also claimed that
he's Harward graduated.

702
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,510
The only one who ever
worked at is fish market.

703
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:47,510
Did you ever hear
about prince William?

704
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:50,000
No. But I'm sure I'd
like to meet one.

705
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:54,170
Am I gonna meet her?
- No.

706
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:56,670
It's like him.

707
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Jesse.

708
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:04,230
Good morning, Jesse.

709
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:10,180
You stop doing that. I get off
your kidding or not.

710
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:12,840
Jesse?

711
00:47:13,930 --> 00:47:17,470
Hello? Oh, no.

712
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:20,530
Come on, Jesse.
Come on.

713
00:47:20,930 --> 00:47:23,250
You are real.
Yes you are.

714
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:26,440
Come on. Come on,
baby, come on.

715
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,970
Don't! Don't be a dummy now!

716
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:36,460
Come one, please.
So hard .

717
00:47:37,830 --> 00:47:40,320
I suppose, I'm
talking to a dummy.

718
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:45,300
I was dancing with the dummy.
Breakfast! Come on! Eat!

719
00:47:51,060 --> 00:47:52,840
Oh, God!

720
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,280
Come on, honey.

721
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,920
Jason, what are
you doing?

722
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,770
This is the girl you brought
last night?

723
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:03,310
It's not what you
are thinking, mom.

724
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,280
And you were watching
on apartment?

725
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,250
I mean,...that...

726
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:35,610
Wanna something else?

727
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,420
Either of you?
- No, thank you.

728
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,390
Oh, thank you.

729
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:50,610
Darling, I need the banner
over here.

730
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:54,850
Thats look smashing fellows.
You are doing wonderfull job.

731
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,530
Hollywood, you got the second?

732
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,190
Always have time for
man in uniform.

733
00:48:58,230 --> 00:49:00,880
How can I get Gail from
perfumes to get notice me?

734
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:04,960
Oh, my Andy I am flattered
of all the people here in "Prince&Co",

735
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:08,190
you've chosen counsel
from the Gangster of Love.

736
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,710
Noone else have any ideas.

737
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:13,610
Gail over perfume? Andy,...

738
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,670
She is not good enough for you.

739
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,590
You have made all in just past weeks,
and all she has done is

740
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:22,480
to ignore you. She omited you,
and treated like dirt on the ground.

741
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,750
So what do you think?
To buy chocolate or something?

742
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,090
Jewelry, baby. Jewelry.
- Jewelry?

743
00:49:27,110 --> 00:49:29,870
Yeah. What kind?
- There is one kind, Andy.

744
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:31,520
Expensive.

745
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,040
But, Andy. I think you
should ignore her.

746
00:49:35,230 --> 00:49:37,230
That always seems to
work best.

747
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,100
Play hard to get.
Thanks old boy.

748
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,050
Now I can count on you!
- Oh, Andy,...

749
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:50,140
And, when you get a chance, I think
you need to visit a Minister of Style.

750
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,570
Oh, umm, Montrows,...

751
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:57,720
the Count is here to
preview the display.

752
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:02,390
Well, I'm not superstitious, but are you
should suppose to be at the day light?

753
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,300
Get back.

754
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:11,260
Hollywood really is genius. He designed
for "Prince&Comp." map.

755
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,280
In fact, he's responsible for...
- I dont care.

756
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:15,490
About these nose hair.

757
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:19,020
He's nothing.
- Well, it hurts.

758
00:50:19,210 --> 00:50:21,420
I want to see enchanted
peasant girl.

759
00:50:21,570 --> 00:50:22,340
Now!

760
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:25,510
Right this way, your
Assholiness.

761
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,720
Did he say...?
- He said...

762
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:30,380
This room is A total mess.

763
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:33,190
Please.
- Ah. That's OK.

764
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,260
You know, Count,
You should try lighten' up.

765
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:42,960
Not thinking so seriously.

766
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:46,190
Learn to enjoy life for

767
00:50:46,690 --> 00:50:47,770
Voila!

768
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:52,690
She's gone!
- Where is she?

769
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:55,190
Where is she???

770
00:50:55,690 --> 00:50:57,690
Parry? Patty?

771
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
Search the store!
Everybody!

772
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:03,100
We must found her.
And if we don't found her...

773
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,600
I will personally

774
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,450
chop off you hands and
for the rest of your life

775
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:09,140
in the dark room with...rats.

776
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:12,150
Big ugly rats! And that
is scaring, believe me.

777
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,360
Hold the rats, Your
Nuisanceness.

778
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:16,590
Here she comes.
Jason?

779
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:22,270
Jason? Come on.

780
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:24,040
Excuse me.

781
00:51:26,660 --> 00:51:27,660
Why you...?

782
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,760
Why you dress her in this?

783
00:51:29,850 --> 00:51:32,040
In these vulgar cloth, a?
- Trash!

784
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:34,060
It's absolute trash!

785
00:51:34,130 --> 00:51:35,770
Wait, just a second.
That's,...

786
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:38,690
from our exclusive junior Miss
designer collection.

787
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:41,760
Good.

788
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,740
Well done, Williamson!

789
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,240
You are like the son
I never had.

790
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:49,600
And I really never wanted.

791
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,070
This is insult of
my entire kingdom.

792
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,570
She is not to be
touched. Again.

793
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:59,560
Weeee....

794
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,950

795
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:06,450
before some place, not,
maybe yes?

796
00:52:06,950 --> 00:52:08,950
I think I would remembered.

797
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,010
Well, lets get bussy.

798
00:52:12,870 --> 00:52:14,310
We have presentation.

799
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:17,310
Yes, perhaps you should
see the rest of the store?

800
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,350
No. No, I would like to be alone
here for a moment, please.

801
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:26,420
You heard what the Count said.
Move!

802
00:52:27,190 --> 00:52:29,190
Everybody to get out!
Move!

803
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:30,510
Move!

804
00:52:33,550 --> 00:52:35,550
Oh, my darling.

805
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:38,950
My darling, very soon,...

806
00:52:39,180 --> 00:52:41,180
very soon you'll be alive.

807
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,300
I wait for that moment as...

808
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:49,050
as that's the greatest day in
one thousend year.

809
00:53:13,170 --> 00:53:15,170
Get out of the way.

810
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:20,990
Well, he's a real charmer.

811
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:23,080
Probably goes fangs at night.

812
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,580
Would you like a cappuccino?

813
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:28,080
No, thanks.
- I better get to work.

814
00:53:40,330 --> 00:53:42,030
I don't know what
happened last night.

815
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:44,730
I don't even know
if you are real.

816
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:48,900
If you can hear me,
I want you to come back.

817
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
I need you to
come back, Jesse.

818
00:53:55,950 --> 00:53:58,560
Oh he's in love.
Who is Jesse?

819
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:01,230
Her.

820
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,020
Oh, Jason.

821
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,190
Hear that?

822
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,320
Oh. Now, we do not fall in love in empty
things unless, of course,

823
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:11,690
that dad is a rich.

824
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:15,100
And in this case her dad is
a dead wood, so forget about it.

825
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:18,910
But last night,...the most
amazing thing happened.

826
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,790
What?

827
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:25,490
Nah. Forget it.

828
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,800
Nothing happened.

829
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,270
Ok, well, in that case, why don't
you run down to store wardrobe

830
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:36,200
and get the rest of wardrobe. Someone
is got a glimps on this presentation.

00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,580
You little. What have you
done with my protg?

832
00:54:45,150 --> 00:54:46,370
I tell you what.

833
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:49,650
You let me borrow this
fierce necklace,...

834
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,040
and all is forgiven.

835
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:57,460
Oh me, oh my, I am in loved
with you, baby.

836
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:01,410
How got I back in here?

837
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,990
What's that?

838
00:55:07,590 --> 00:55:09,120
Who's there?

839
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,730
Hello?

840
00:55:17,530 --> 00:55:19,530
Are you looking at me?

841
00:55:19,630 --> 00:55:21,210
Are you looking at me?

842
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,380
Must be. There's no one
else here.

843
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:25,850
Get back body De Niro.

Oh, I like it!
Hey! Look at this one!

Now get out of here.
And go guard the girl.

855
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:16,620
Would you like to
try Black Force Two?

856
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,830
It's Hauptman Koenig special.

857
00:56:18,970 --> 00:56:20,270
Oh, thank you.

858

00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,800
Poor, poor Inga.

860
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,160
What happened to her?
- She was eaten by a boar.

861
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,300
Wel, oh, you know Jason.

862
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:42,230
Jason? Oh, yes. He let
me sleep in bad last night.

863
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:47,120
He did? Oh, well...

864
00:56:47,310 --> 00:56:49,310
If you don't mind asking,

865
00:56:49,810 --> 00:56:52,490
how was it?
- Wonderfull.

866
00:56:52,590 --> 00:56:56,420
He showed me things I never
would imagined in a thousand years.

867
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:58,090
I must go find him.

868
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,470
Wanna to take that wart out of
his face and make him eat it.

869
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,720
He could be anywhere. Hey!

870
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,790
You, fancy guy! What do you
do with that necklace?

871
00:57:13,850 --> 00:57:16,430
This is property of
Hauptmann Koenig.

872
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,560
And they are not for
you to play.

873
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:21,150
Dress her and go.
- And if we ever

874
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:23,650
ever catch you...
Listen!

875
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,150
The girl is gone again.

876
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,830
What have you done with her?

877
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,690
Just let mi figure out
what am I doing on the floor.

878
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:36,060
And I'll get back to you. Ok?

879
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,380
The necklace is here,

880
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,030
but the enchanted peasant
girl is gone.

881
00:57:45,190 --> 00:57:49,860
You don't think this really is something
to curse thing. - Is it true?

882
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:52,680
We have blown our trip to Bermuda!
- Bermuda!

I dont have a home.
- Oh.

914
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:33,210
It's been nice talking to you.

915
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:37,720
My friend Jason would love
furniture like this.

916
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,290
Meow! Hello, again!

917
00:59:41,600 --> 00:59:42,930
This is his picture.

918
00:59:43,430 --> 00:59:45,260
His picture? Yes.

919
00:59:45,560 --> 00:59:47,260
Well, yes.

920
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:50,610
He looks like he could use
really nice furniture.

921
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:52,440
But, I have no silver.

922
00:59:52,940 --> 00:59:56,380
Oh, nobody uses cash anymore.

923
00:59:58,270 --> 01:00:01,560
We'll just put it on
his employee accounts.

924
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,180
What exactly do you want
and where would you like?

925
01:00:04,560 --> 01:00:05,860
Oh, it must be soon.

926
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:08,290
I don't know how much
longer I'll stay alive.

927
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,790
Ah. Too bad.

928
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:14,530
Well, I have delivery date
this morning.

929
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:17,530
Oh, good.
- We can have deliver then? And,

930
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:21,840
who knows - you may
still be alive.

931
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:26,750
It must be from something I ate.
No more sushi at 3:00 A.M.

932
01:00:27,030 --> 01:00:28,420
What's the matter, Holly?

933
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,360
Not sure about it, man.
I'm just not sure.

934
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:34,330
I just get back to my trip to Ozz.
- Where is Jesse?

935
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:36,490
I don't know.
- What do you mean you don't know.

936
01:00:36,680 --> 01:00:39,990
She was here. And when I got back
from Wonderland, she was gone.

937
01:00:40,220 --> 01:00:42,330
Find her. She can be in a trouble!

938
01:00:42,830 --> 01:00:46,310
Hold on! You said you wanted to tell me
about last night. What happened?

939
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:52,180
She came to life.She was alive.
It's all curse thing it's true...

940
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:54,680
Can't explain. We...We ate.

941
01:00:54,940 --> 01:00:57,180
We walked around.
We were dancing.

942
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,850
Now you thing I'm nuts.

943
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:02,730

01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,160

947
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:17,570
I can't believe it!

948
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:20,400
Arnold! Egon!
Come here!

949
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,110
Look! The girl!

950
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,610
She's alive! She's moving!

951
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:29,240
It's impossible!
- Yes. It's her!

952
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,820
She know us.

953
01:01:38,770 --> 01:01:40,770
Come! Go!

954
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,320
Is that for sure?

955
01:02:10,940 --> 01:02:12,940
Can I help you?

956
01:02:13,050 --> 01:02:15,050
Could you make me
look different?

957
01:02:15,210 --> 01:02:17,210
Funny. We can change
your whole life.

958
01:02:57,510 --> 01:03:00,120
No no no. It is...

959
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,140
It is HIM!

960
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,460
It is him. I knew I know
that guy some place.

961
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:09,420
It is Prince William
cursed the ages!

962
01:03:10,250 --> 01:03:12,500
Her Count! Count Spretzzel!

963
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:15,220
Count Spretzzel,
she's come to life.

964
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:17,860
The enchanted peasant
girl's alive.

965
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:20,020
That is impossible!
It can't be noch!

966
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,710
She'll be mine tomorrow,
calculating precisely,

967
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:26,020
you know, the exact moment.

968
01:03:26,150 --> 01:03:29,290
Someone has removed her necklace.

969
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,320
Maybe she has found true love?

970
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,630
I want,

971
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:36,320

974
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:47,780
And his love life.

975
01:03:48,950 --> 01:03:51,220
No! No! What are you doing?

976
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,110
No one is mess with
Count Spretzzel.

977
01:03:55,110 --> 01:03:58,400
I'll shoot you,I'll shoot you, not
through mouth, not through eye

978
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,400
but through the heart.

979
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:05,020
Anything?
- No, not a trace.

980
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,930
I thought Cupid aimed
for the heart.

981
01:04:08,950 --> 01:04:12,270
I'll get you this time
my little sweety pie.

982
01:04:12,770 --> 01:04:14,560
What the...?
- Hit the deck!

983
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:17,480
I learnt this on the marine.

984
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:20,210
You were in the marines?
- Yes. They were looking for

985
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:21,960
a few good men.
So was I.

986
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,470
Ok. We better split up.
- Where have I heard that before?

987
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:34,530
Get down, honey! Get down!

988
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:35,900
It's down.

989
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,430
Take the second floor.
I'll take the floor.

990
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,280
There he is!

991
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,570
What a fit!
And no wrinkles.

992
01:05:14,880 --> 01:05:17,430
It's poliester.
- Poliester.

993
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:20,420
What plant is that from?
- Umm...

994
01:05:20,610 --> 01:05:23,810
The New Jersey one.
Will this be cash or charge?

995
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,310
Who uses cash these days?

996
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:28,360
Jesse!
- Jason!

997
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:31,730
Jason!
- Slaught him!

998
01:05:36,990 --> 01:05:38,260
I'll be right back.

999
01:05:40,660 --> 01:05:42,660
This time we'll really kill him.

1000
01:05:57,250 --> 01:05:58,570
Jason!

1001
01:05:58,630 --> 01:06:00,120
Jason, come on!

1002
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:03,100
Aaaa! Stop her!

1003
01:06:06,510 --> 01:06:08,740
Are you ok? I never tought I'll
see you alive again.

1004
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,340
What? - I said I never
thought see you alive again.

1005
01:06:12,490 --> 01:06:13,930
I can't hear!

1006
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:16,280
Look out!

1007
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,280
Keep going!
Keep going!

1008
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:30,030
Get out! Get out!
- Hold on!

1009
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,320
You're OK?
- Look out for the window!

1010
01:06:43,370 --> 01:06:45,370
Throw out of the window?
- No! No!

1011
01:06:52,190 --> 01:06:55,000
Jason!
- Jesse!

1012
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:58,160
I can't stop it!
- Use the breaks!

1013
01:06:58,660 --> 01:07:00,660
Next to pedals!

1014
01:07:02,350 --> 01:07:04,350
Jesse! Look out!

1015
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:09,650
Hey! Hey! Come on!
To the store!

1016
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:14,880
Whats was happening.

1017
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
What the hack is going on here?

1018
01:07:17,290 --> 01:07:20,100
Find that boy has stolen the
enchanted peasant girl!

1019
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:22,350
Montrows! Montrows!

1020
01:07:22,850 --> 01:07:24,850
Your new assistent - where is he?

1021
01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:26,440
Lets go.

1022
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:34,120
Wait! Wait! Wait
one minute.

1023
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,060
We are going to follow fancy boy.

1024
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,080
Get me out of this armour!

1025
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,390
She has great
sense of direction!

1026
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,290
Look your mother gave me
all these peoples lives!

1027
01:08:06,540 --> 01:08:09,000
Jesse. I was scared I was never
gonna see you again.

1028
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:13,880
My love was stolen once before, but it's
never gonna happen again.

1029
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:18,220
Nothing will become between us.

1030
01:08:25,770 --> 01:08:27,440
Could you do that again, please?

1031
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:38,950
Where did all this
furniture come from?

1032
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:42,370
It's my gift to you.
- You bought it?

1033
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:43,370
Yeah.

1034
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:45,830
With little magic card.

1035
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:46,830
Ouch!

1036
01:08:48,210 --> 01:08:50,670
Ok. Look, we have to
get out of here.

1037
01:08:51,420 --> 01:08:52,880
We gotta go out of here.
- Wait! wait!

1038
01:08:52,750 --> 01:08:56,170
Where we going?
- Anywhere, we just have to get out of here.

1039
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,180
Wait. I love you.

1040
01:09:07,480 --> 01:09:08,390
What is that?

1041
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:14,860
It's too late.
Just stay here. OK?

1042
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:15,860
Don't worry.
- Just don't,

1043
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:20,030
Again.
- Ok, just...just...

1044
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:34,460
Jason! He is comming!
- What's going on? - Where is she?

1045
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:39,720
That is him. The peasant
girl must be here.

1046
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,050
You are in big trouble, pal.

1047
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:44,890
Search this house.
- Check out the back.

1048
01:09:44,890 --> 01:09:45,810
Nobody escape me.

1049
01:09:46,810 --> 01:09:48,640
I will look up the stairs.

1050
01:09:49,230 --> 01:09:51,150
Hey, no! You can't get up there!

1051
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:53,980
Don't ever, ever,
touch the Count, OK?

1052
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:56,400
If I wanna go up the stairs,
I go up stairs.

1053
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,440
My feel is go up
the stairs now.

1054
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:03,070
You have the right remain silent.
Anything you say can be used...

1055
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:04,240
It's you!

1056
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,290
Don't be afraid to use the gun.

1057
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,420
You can't threaten my son!

1058
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:22,090
Is everything allright?

1059
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:27,260
Everything is just perfect.
- Sorcerer!

1060
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,640
Oh, my little sweety pie.
You have to come with me, because...

1061
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:33,690
We must fullfill our destiny.

1062
01:10:33,730 --> 01:10:37,730
I love Jason. You can't make
me go with you.

1063
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,070
Here now.

1064
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:51,370
My lovely...

1065
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,800
You've been stealing
furniture from us. Shame!

1066
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,430
I didn't steal it.
She bought it for me.

1067
01:11:04,380 --> 01:11:08,180
Who? The enchanted peasant girl?
- Yes.

1068
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,270
You are sort of a psycho.

1069
01:11:12,810 --> 01:11:15,100
And I think I even gave you my flower.

1070
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:18,070
Oh, look. There's your mains queez.

1071
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:21,940
Jesse! Come on! Let her go!
She's real! I swear!

1072
01:11:21,950 --> 01:11:23,400
Oh, my God!

1073
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:26,530
He's in love with a dummy!

1074
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:30,990
Wait, wait, honey. I will do that.
- Ok. We have what we come, right?

1075
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,580
Now. To the airport. Quick!

1076
01:11:32,580 --> 01:11:36,830
Just one little minute. Count, we have
presentation tomorrow afternoon.

1077
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:38,500
I know that, but...

1078
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:43,130
And we have a contract that
you are not going to break.

1079
01:11:43,340 --> 01:11:44,590
I know that, but...

1080
01:11:44,630 --> 01:11:45,970
Grab the dummy!

1081
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:50,390
The other dummy.

1082
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,560
Easy! Easy! Easy!
- Allright. It's allright

1083
01:11:53,560 --> 01:11:57,100
Must be very, very gentle.

1084
01:11:57,110 --> 01:11:58,110
Necklace!

1085
01:11:58,110 --> 01:12:03,190
That's it! That's it what it use it!
Take the necklace off! She's real, I swear.

1086
01:12:03,190 --> 01:12:03,940
Take it off!

1087
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:06,110
Yes. And I'm Rumpelstitkin.

1088
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:09,280
No! No! It's true!
- Come on!

1089
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,750
It's true. No one could make up such story
except, perheps, someone like myself?

1090
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:19,590
And Count, please, don't worry about pretty
little wart...face about all this

1091
01:12:19,670 --> 01:12:23,210
We have some very large armed
gentlemen to guard her.

1092
01:12:23,550 --> 01:12:26,550
Tomorrow afternoon, she'll be all yours.

1093
01:12:27,890 --> 01:12:29,140
Thank you so much.

1094
01:12:32,100 --> 01:12:33,970
I never had this problem...

1095
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:36,980
Too much red meat.

1096
01:12:39,020 --> 01:12:39,900
Come on.

1097
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,490
So.

1098
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:47,030
All we have to do is wait
the end of presentation,

1099
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:50,410
and they would hand us a...girl.

1100
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:56,040
And it's...to Bermuda.
- Bermuda!

1101
01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,210
Shut up. Shut up.

1102
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:58,210
Go go go ...

1103
01:13:06,630 --> 01:13:09,590
I am sorry, madam,
to have takken all your time.

1104
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:19,390
Once again I'm holding the bat!

1105
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:21,730
Oh. Nothing personal.

1106
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:41,810
I'm here to pick one of man
and take him down town.

1107
01:14:42,390 --> 01:14:43,810
We are down town.

1108
01:14:45,110 --> 01:14:47,980
I mean down down town.
Way, way down.

1109
01:14:47,980 --> 01:14:49,648
He's gonna digging
trees for years.

1110
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:53,610
Who are you?
- Step sergeant Mantrows, sir.

1111
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:54,450
Butch Mantrows.

1112
01:14:54,870 --> 01:14:57,910
What do you want with the prisoner?
- He took the powder..how's the word?...

1113
01:14:58,290 --> 01:14:58,910
That's it.

1114
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:05,830
He's gonna be at court at 25:00.

1115
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:09,380
You got a name?
- Step sergeant Butch Mantrows.

1116
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:12,050
Not yours. The prisoners.

1117
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:15,470
Williamson, sir.
Jason Williamson.

1118
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,510
The nuts with dummy?
- I know, it's sad, isn't it?

1119
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:22,940
Hey, Al. Take this guy
down to the holding cell.

1120
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:26,100
Give him 3 0 7. You know,
"the dummy kid".

1121
01:15:26,520 --> 01:15:27,400
Thank you, sir!

1122
01:15:31,030 --> 01:15:31,740
Hey!

1123
01:15:33,490 --> 01:15:34,990
You didn't sign these.

1124
01:15:37,870 --> 01:15:38,830
So sorry.

1125
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:59,760
Jason Williamson.
Gotta friend of yours here.

1126
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,270
Williamson, follow me.

1127
01:16:12,190 --> 01:16:13,570
I hope this will works.

1128
01:16:22,450 --> 01:16:23,450
Hey!

1129
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:25,210
Let's moving.

1130
01:16:25,210 --> 01:16:26,710
Hold it right there!

1131
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:28,330
Run, Jason!

1132
01:16:28,880 --> 01:16:31,590
Get back here!
- Stop right there!

1133
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:33,590
So sorry!

1134
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:36,470
The car!
- Stop!

1135
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,180
Go!

1136
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,260
Mom?
- Come on.

1137
01:16:39,260 --> 01:16:41,390
What kind of kid did I rised?
You get cops on your tail.

1138
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:42,390
Keep your head down!

1139
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:44,560
I have to save her, Hollywood!

1140
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:46,690
They are guarding her
like Fort Knox, but,

1141
01:16:46,690 --> 01:16:49,730
hold on, this old bosses ass
has a plan.

1142
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:03,740
Sheila Barberstein and her sister.
- Sheilas father is marvelous guy.

1143
01:17:04,540 --> 01:17:05,250
Nice to see you.

1144
01:17:05,700 --> 01:17:07,660
Well, Count.

1145
01:17:07,920 --> 01:17:09,210
May I call you Gunther?

1146
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,840
No, no.

1147
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:15,340
Everything seems to be
going very smoothly.

1148
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:17,550
Well, I hope that
it's stay that way.

1149
01:17:18,260 --> 01:17:21,510
Yes. Well I personaly intended
that everyt .. t ..

1150
01:17:22,550 --> 01:17:25,100
Oh, my God. "Tinorama", Philadelphia.

1151
01:17:25,600 --> 01:17:26,390
You know what that means?

1152
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:28,310
We'll be swamp with teenagers.

1153
01:17:28,770 --> 01:17:32,560
It's terrible, sir.
- No, that's wonderfull, you tall twit.

1154
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:35,070
Teenagers are consumers that
spend hard cash.

1155
01:17:35,070 --> 01:17:39,110
Take a memo: Mark everything at
junior department up to 10%.-15%.

1156
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:43,490
I want to be sure that "Prince and Co."
banner will be prominently displayed on...

1157
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,830
... will be prominently displayed on
screen at all time.

1158
01:17:45,950 --> 01:17:47,750
Relax, I'm not the director.

1159
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:51,380
Is it someone I can talk to who will
give me a little respect here?

1160
01:17:51,830 --> 01:17:52,630
I doubt it.

1161
01:17:56,670 --> 01:17:58,380
Thanks a lot. Gotta vale.

1162
01:17:58,380 --> 01:18:01,010
Hey, anytime.
Anytime you want a job.

1163
01:18:01,590 --> 01:18:03,970
Good luck.
- Oh, carefull !!

1164
01:18:09,980 --> 01:18:13,400
Ladies and gentlemen,
the show is about to begin.

1165
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:17,570
I must say: I did not think
that you could pull this off.

1166
01:18:17,690 --> 01:18:19,740
It is very, very dignified.

1167
01:18:19,950 --> 01:18:21,110
Well, thank you, sir.

1168
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,950
When it comes to dignity,
I am the master.

1169
01:18:24,070 --> 01:18:25,120
Yes. Fine.

1170
01:18:25,330 --> 01:18:28,410
Then you reach perfection,
when you zapp up your fly.

1171
01:18:28,410 --> 01:18:30,710
I'm just kidding.
It's count Spretzzels joke.

1172
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:36,670
Is everything in readyness for
a immediately departure?

1173
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,470
Transplatation has been arranged.
- Very good. Very good indeed.

1174
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:51,810
I don't know if you can hear me,
but, if you can,

1175
01:18:52,190 --> 01:18:54,520
I want you to care very
good at Jason.

1176
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:56,150
He's a prime catch.

1177
01:18:56,770 --> 01:18:59,320
And you are very, very lucky...

1178
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:02,820
...Mannequin.
- Hey. To whom are you talking to?

1179
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:04,570
Just wishing her a luck.

1180
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:06,120
She's the star of the
Show, you know.

1181
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:16,710
What are you doing here.
You are 10 mins late...

1182
01:19:16,710 --> 01:19:18,750
Uuuu, I just love your hair!

1183
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:19,760
Thank you.

1184
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,840
Here. It's yours.

1185
01:19:21,050 --> 01:19:23,590
Wrong style, honey.
- Do you really think we can hold it all?

1186
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:26,140
Of course me, amigo.
You'd better get going.

1187
01:19:27,850 --> 01:19:29,930
Come on, girls. Let's be
in a minute. Let's go!

1188
01:19:29,930 --> 01:19:32,100
Lights! The excitement!

1189
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,600
Show business is my life.

1190
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:50,580
Ah, excuse me.
I am Muriel Don Williamson.

1191
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:42,920
You ... You call this dignified?

1192
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:48,340
Well, I think it's Hipp, you know.

1193
01:20:55,350 --> 01:21:00,020
<i>Once upon a time, a peasant
girl was victim of a crime.</i>

1194
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:08,320
<i>Was frozen ever since,
she dared to love the handsome prince.</i>

1195
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:09,995
<i>Is that so wrong?</i>

1196
01:21:10,871 --> 01:21:13,790
<i>But, alas, a thousand years has passed,</i>

1197
01:21:14,580 --> 01:21:16,210
<i>since that spell from hell</i>

1198
01:21:16,580 --> 01:21:18,000
<i>had been cast.</i>

1199
01:21:20,630 --> 01:21:21,840
Where is she?

1200
01:21:23,130 --> 01:21:24,920
<i>Today, my friends,</i>

1201
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:26,470
<i>that spell again,...</i>

1202
01:21:29,470 --> 01:21:31,220
Ladies and Gentlemen!

1203
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:34,310
"Prince & Co" is proud
to presents:

1204
01:21:34,310 --> 01:21:38,230
Our beloved, enchanted peasant girl!

1205
01:21:47,110 --> 01:21:49,400
And, here to free her forever,

1206
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,610
with kiss of life,

1207
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:52,780
The Prince!

1208
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:54,910
That's my kid!

1209
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:09,930
Stop this music!
Stop this nonsence!

1210
01:22:10,090 --> 01:22:13,260
I will not...I will not
let it continue!

1211
01:22:13,260 --> 01:22:14,640
Count!

1212
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:18,600
No one! No one treat my
culture like this!

1213
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,190
Count!
- Ouch!

1214
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:23,480
Someone stop this fool,
before I strike him with this mycrophone!

1215
01:22:23,610 --> 01:22:25,520
He is about to
ruin my presentation!

1216
01:22:25,530 --> 01:22:27,320
Get him out of here!

1217
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:28,690
Let's go!

1218
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:30,280
Outrageous!

1219
01:22:31,200 --> 01:22:36,200
Go ahead! Laugh, laugh and have a
fun, my little stupid Americans.

1220
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:42,620
Boo-hoo to you too. Because,
this party is now over.

1221
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:47,590
And I am taking my peasant girl
and getting out of here!

1222
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,800
Unhand that damesel!

1223
01:22:52,220 --> 01:22:54,600
I command you to
step aside.

1224
01:22:54,890 --> 01:22:56,930
Are you kidding me or what?

1225
01:22:57,600 --> 01:23:00,020
She belong to me.

1226
01:23:00,520 --> 01:23:03,020
She's a living soul.
She belongs to no one.

1227
01:23:03,270 --> 01:23:07,360
Then! We will settle this like a man!

1228
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:16,330
Come on, Jason!
For love and honor!

1229
01:23:16,330 --> 01:23:19,700
Come on, Count!
For money and Bermuda!

1230
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,250
Shut up!

1231
01:23:21,910 --> 01:23:25,040
I've come from a long line of offensers.
I have royal Bavarian blood.

1232
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:28,380
Which I...will be happy..to shed!!!

1233
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,720
As I wait, one thousand year
for this moment.

1234
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,430
And no pitzquick like you
is going to interfere

1235
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:41,890

1236
01:24:04,837 --> 01:24:06,210
Juste, ha!

1237
01:24:22,020 --> 01:24:23,640
Look so painfull.

1238
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,440
Good.

1239
01:24:40,410 --> 01:24:43,410
Jason!
- Everything is gonna be OK.

1240
01:24:46,750 --> 01:24:49,040
Come on... You must be kidding!
That's not fair!

1241
01:24:49,460 --> 01:24:51,090
So, I cheat!
Sue me!

1242
01:24:51,340 --> 01:24:54,840
This is my store! My presentation of
career! How dare you!

1243
01:24:58,970 --> 01:25:01,430
I'm in trouble!
Get the doctor on the double!

1244
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:03,680
I'm in trouble!
Get the doctor on the double!

1245
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:04,680
Stop it! Stop it!

1246
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:05,680
Stop it! Stop it!

1247
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:08,350
This fairy tales gone further enough, ha?

01:25:11,730 --> 01:25:13,900
Come here, my dear.

1249
01:25:13,900 --> 01:25:18,240
Look! Look!... Look at this!
Come here! Come on.

1250
01:25:19,536 --> 01:25:21,663
Don't you move!
You move!

1251
01:25:21,740 --> 01:25:24,333
Come on! That's it.

1252
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,750
Nobody move.

1253
01:25:29,830 --> 01:25:30,540
Come on!

1254
01:25:35,710 --> 01:25:36,670
He's not going
away with this!

1255
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:37,800
I'm just behind you!

1256
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:41,760
Come on! Come on!
- Let me go!

1257
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,600
Do you want necklace again?
Come on!

1258
01:25:44,260 --> 01:25:46,140
Gentlemen, get out of the away!

1259

Want you come back!

I'll take this right one!
- Come on!

1261
01:25:51,940 --> 01:25:53,150
Gentlemen, leave them to me!

1262
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,740
That's extra firm hole too.

1263
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:06,160
He's taking her to the roof.
Come on! Take the stairs!

1264
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,290
Must we?

1265
01:26:07,370 --> 01:26:08,710
I'll watch the goons.

1266
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:10,670
Down to your bellies. NOW.

1267
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:13,590
Andy! Your so forcefull!

1268
01:26:21,550 --> 01:26:23,260
I do not believe it!

1269
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:29,060
Let me go!

1270
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:37,690
Why don't you take helicopter.
What you do?

1271
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:40,150
I thought this will be
more romantic.

1272
01:26:40,610 --> 01:26:42,450
More romantic!?
Get out with you, idiot!

1273
01:26:42,450 --> 01:26:45,490
Stand aside!
Dancing strenghten the legs.

1274
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:49,200
Stop it!

1275
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:52,460
Jason!
- Go ahead!

1276
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,590
Make my day!
- Only one little gun!

1277
01:26:56,000 --> 01:26:58,260
Honey, I am from
North Philadelphia!

1278
01:27:01,130 --> 01:27:02,800
What do you doing?
- It stuck.

1279
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:03,800
Stand back!

1280
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:10,020
I'll take care of this.
- No, Hollywood.

1281
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:11,773
This is my job.

1282
01:27:12,980 --> 01:27:16,440
You're not gonna take her to
Hauptmann Koenig, Spretzzel!

1283
01:27:18,110 --> 01:27:19,280
I won't alow it!

1284
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:20,280
Let her go!

1285
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:28,370

Allow me.

1288
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:40,920
Jason!
- No Jason for you.

1289
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:42,090
Jesse!

1290
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,760
I guess I win! Right?

1291
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:47,430
Jason!

1292
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:49,180
That must be veeery painfull.

1293
01:27:49,220 --> 01:27:53,730
Nevertheless. We are finnaly
alone at last in this little baloon.

1294
01:27:53,730 --> 01:27:56,360
How about little...

1295
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:58,110
Leave me alone!

1296
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,740
Don't ever-ever,
resist a Count!

1297
01:28:06,410 --> 01:28:06,950
No!

1298
01:28:09,740 --> 01:28:11,750
Yes, you want me!
- Stop it! Get away!

1299
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:15,460
Spretzzel! You let her go!
Jason loves her!

1300
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:18,670
Come one my princess, you must
learn to obeying me! - Stop it!

1301
01:28:19,380 --> 01:28:21,260
Not if I have anything
to say about it!

1302
01:28:29,220 --> 01:28:30,260
I can't do it.

1303
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:34,140
Good. Good. That's very good.

1304
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:36,730
Guess what? I can.

1305
01:28:37,190 --> 01:28:37,940
No!

1306
01:28:41,110 --> 01:28:44,030
Let him go!
- Down my little prince, down you go.

1307
01:28:47,410 --> 01:28:48,950
Bye, bye, my little prince.

1308
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:53,950
In one thousend years on the single day,
only a true love will make take the curse away.

1309
01:28:53,960 --> 01:28:54,500
No!

1310
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:59,960
Jason! It works!

1311
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:04,090
Oh, no!

1312
01:29:13,810 --> 01:29:16,140
Count! I can't believe it!

1313
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:19,610
We blowed up trip to Bermuda!

1314
01:29:20,860 --> 01:29:25,650

01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,930
For ever!
- And ever.

1321
01:30:01,690 --> 01:30:04,480
And that was the Legend about
Count Spretzzel.

1322
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,280
Of course, nobody
really believes in.

1323
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:11,450
Now, if you come this way, I'll show you
