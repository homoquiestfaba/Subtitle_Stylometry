1
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Dana?

2
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,400
Dana, can you hear me?

3
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,320
Just follow the instructions.
Is that so difficult?

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,720
No, no, "N"!

5
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Harold.

6
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,040
It's very becoming. I like that.

7
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,360
Guys, there's nothing
I can do, all right?

8
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,200
The meeting's gonna be canceled.

9
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,120
The building's being evacuated.

10
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,960
Top four floors are closed off.
I don't know what's going on.

11
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,960
It doesn't matter.
Nobody's supposed to be there.

12
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Just follow the instructions.
Is that so difficult?

13
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,160
Clifford, it's 2:37
and my interns are stranded.

14
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,640
- Where the fuck is he?
- He's coming.

15
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,280
- He's coming?
- He's coming.

16
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,200
I think we got something.

17
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,240
Oh, my God. Is that him?

18
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,360
South side of the building.
Do you see it?

19
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,320
- That's him! He's here!
- Oh, my God!

20
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,960
He's landing! Clear the roof!

21
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,520
- Get your things. Go! Come on!
- Quickly.

22
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,360
He keeps his promises.

23
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,840
Fake.

24
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,240
- Fake.
- Yes.

25
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,640
Malika, Clifford is the man
who wrote Fake.

26
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,640
An excellent book
about the guy, artist...

27
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm blanking... Who was it?

28
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,040
- Art forger.
- The art forger.

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,760
- Exactly. Elmyr de Hory was his name.
- Okay.

30
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:33,600
He forged Picassos, Matisses,
Modiglianis...

31
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:37,160
The whole theory of forgery as art.
What is art?

32
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,960
Very subversive kind of act.

33
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,760
The book sold poorly.

34
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,760
- Well, it could've done better.
- Let's not talk about that today.

35
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,080
Regardless. The new one. Fiction.

36
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,480
- Yes.
- Rudnick's Problem.

37
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,040
I like it. You're right.

38
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,680
- I like it. Malika liked it, too.
- Yeah.

39
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,280
Yes, I did. I loved it. It was stunning.

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,120
It scared the hell out of me, actually,
to tell you the truth.

41
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,080
- It's an angry book.
- But funny!

42
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,920
I mean, I read it,
I thought it was hilarious.

43
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,800
It wasn't angry to me.

44
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,960
It was nice to me. It made me laugh.

45
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,640
But anger's important. We need anger.

46
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,240
Which I think will help us in Germany.

47
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,480
Regardless,
marry us and have our children?

48
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:21,400
Brad Silber at Life is reading it
right now for serialization rights.

49
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,480
Great.

50
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,760
Harold McGraw himself
is reading it this weekend.

51
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,640
- You're kidding.
- That's just a formality.

52
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,600
You have waited, Cliff.

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,120
You've watched as less talented writers
have bypassed you.

54
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,920
But now, justice at last.

55
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,880
They're going to push this one hard.
They're going to bet the bank.

56
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,680
- Is that a promise?
- You can set your watch by it.

57
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,480
Andrea, I don't have a watch.

58
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,720
Then buy one.
Trust me, you can afford it.

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,440
Calls unreturned, they don't read you

60
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,400
for six months, they're indifferent.

61
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:02,720
Then overnight... God.
Dick, can you hear me?

62
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,040
Dick! Here, try these. They're bigger.

63
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,200
No, they're fine.

64
00:05:07,201 --> 00:05:10,920
We're doing a vacation,
a gentleman's celebration kind of thing.

65
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,440
You got harpoons?
The ones that shoot?

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,760
- Yeah, most of them shoot.
- Good.

67
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,120
He looks like a sausage.
All right, I'll take the whole outfit.

68
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,840
Set me up as a regular account.
I prefer monthly payments.

69
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,040
You're a prick, Robert, you are such
a prick. You played me like a harp.

70
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,000
Whitewalls, leather...
Is this guy a salesman?

71
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,200
Now, when my accountant comes by
with the check,

72
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,440
should he talk to you directly?

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,440
He should speak to me directly, yeah,
with the check, yeah.

74
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:42,520
Call the police, there's a
beautiful woman in front of my house!

75
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,040
What's the matter, pear?

76
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,400
You haven't seen
a bestselling author before?

77
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,640
- Oh, Cliff.
- Yes.

78
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,920
You didn't think I was going to do it,
did you?

79
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,360
Stop, Cliff, stop.
Look, they're taking the sofa.

80
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,440
Oh, I love that sofa.

81
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,640
Hey, guys. How are you doing?

82
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,560
Ah, fuck the sofa.

83
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,200
- Close your eyes. Close, close.
- What?

84
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,680
- Okay.
- Oh, Cliff.

85
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,880
Cliff!

86
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,480
There, perfect.
You are a beautiful man.

87
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,240
I am sure you would desert me.

88
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,920
No, will desert you,
the tense is future active.

89
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,800
Don't correct the grammar of it.
You are not this perfect person.

90
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:38,040
Honey, it's finished.
I told you it was finished.

91
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,800
It's finished with her.

92
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,000
- Good night.
- Cliff...

93
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,520
- Keys to my new car.
- Yeah, got it. Bye, honey.

94
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
Have fun.

95
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Andrea!

96
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,720
Andrea! Hi, isn't this amazing?
Isn't this wild?

97
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,880
- Can I talk to you a second?
- Let's talk on Monday, Cliff.

98
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,360
No, just for a second.
It's really important. I'd like to...

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,480
Look, 30,000 copies is not gonna do it.

100
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,840
A short run like that,
it sends out a message,

101
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
and it's not a good one.

102
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,560
- We're not publishing the book.
- Exactly, exactly.

103
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,440
With 30,000 copies, it's like
we're not really publishing the book...

104
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,680
Brad Silber at Life magazine hated it.
He called it,

105
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,400
"A third-rate Philip Roth knock-off."
And he told Harold. And it was awful.

106
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
It just rolled like a snowball.

107
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
I wanted to tell you on Monday.
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,680
Fine, we'll do The New Yorker.
The New Yorker's better anyway...

109
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
You're not listening to me, Cliff.

110
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,120
McGraw-Hill is not publishing
your book.

111
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,480
Book, gone. The bomb has dropped.

112
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,480
It's over.

113
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,880
Andrea, you said
that this was a formality.

114
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,000
Well, apparently, I was mistaken.

115
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:50,240
Look, if you have other ideas,
my door is always open to you.

116
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,000
The enemy, very deceitfully,

117
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,320
has taken advantage of the troops...

118
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,600
They are potatoes, all of them.
Potato people.

119
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,600
And you are a brilliant, strong man
who will have all his dreams.

120
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,760
All of them.

121
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,400
You know what I'm getting
for dinner? Swordfish steak.

122
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,720
It sounds good. Sounds enticing.

123
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,960
Oh, come on, Cliff. Forget it, forget it.

124
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,440
All right. Enough, enough.

125
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,560
I want to talk about my friend.

126
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,240
Tell me about the children's book
you're working on.

127
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,640
Oh, Richard the Lionhearted.
That's going okay.

128
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,920
I should be done
by the end of the year.

129
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,840
You know, it's a great subject.
War, sodomy.

130
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,400
I mean, the war part's great.
Kids love war.

131
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,640
But what do you do with the sodomy?
You know?

132
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,040
You see, I want it to be
historically accurate.

133
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,160
And you will make it so
because you are a superb researcher,

134
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
and a fine writer.

135
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,200
Thank you.

136
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,200
Bumped by this adolescent coffee boy.

137
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,280
My lit professor at Cornell
compared me to Hemingway.

138
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,480
The middle of my life is at hand.
I don't have a couch.

139
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,240
Think about this.

140
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,760
Henry Miller was 38 years old,
unpublished.

141
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,080
His wife left him for a lesbian.

142
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,640
You're kind to tell me that, Dick.

143
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,640
You're a very good man.
You're a good friend.

144
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,440
- Need a loan?
- Always.

145
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,880
- No, no. I was kidding, Cliff.
- You got a pen, kid?

146
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,520
I was kidding.
Your house is going into foreclosure.

147
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,800
- I'm post-dating it.
- Stop that. Stop being the hero.

148
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,760
- Go to bed.
- I got it, I got it. Walk away. Go.

149
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,120
- I got it.
- All right.

150
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,600
- Go to bed.
- I will.

151
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,480
Everyone's being relocated
to another hotel.

152
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,040
Please stay calm and follow me.

153
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,480
- Excuse me. Can you...
- Follow me, please!

154
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,200
Somebody told me
that Howard Hughes is

155
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,080
moving into this hotel.

156
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,120
What is this? What's going on?

157
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,880
It's an executive decision
to close the facility for the weekend, sir.

158
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,760
- You're being relocated.
- Executive decision?

159
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,760
Howard Hughes
wants the pool to himself,

160
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,680
so he's kicking everyone out
at 1:00 a.m.?

161
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,840
I don't know about that, sir.

162
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,280
That's power.

163
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,040
It's a friendship
between Tom Mix and Pancho Villa.

164
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,120
Revolution, Mexican revolution.

165
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,520
Men were men.

166
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,280
- Friendship and...
- Mr. Clifford?

167
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,320
Andrea's running late, so she said
that we should just go ahead

168
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,720
and start the meeting without her.

169
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,760
"Mr. Clifford"? Wait a minute.

170
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,040
I'm meeting with you?

171
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,920
Oh, no. Excuse me.

172
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,480
Mr. Clifford...

173
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,880
Excuse me!
Hello, I'm sorry, everybody. Andrea...

174
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
I'm sorry. I did tell him, but...

175
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,360
Cliff, I'm in the middle
of a conference meeting.

176
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:25,040
Andrea, our personal history demands
that I bring this to you first.

177
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,400
Bring what?

178
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,960
I'm working on the most important book
of the 20th century.

179
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,360
It's unprecedented.
I'm gonna discuss it tomorrow.

180
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
I'm gonna present the details
about it tomorrow.

181
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,880
- Okay.
- Morning, 9:00 a.m.

182
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,600
- Thank you.
- At Nathan's Bowling Alley in Queens.

183
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,840
- Did I ever take you there before?
- Sir?

184
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,080
Okay, yeah, I'm going, I'm going.

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
You'd better be sure, Andrea,
that I don't have anything,

186
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,520
'cause Simon and Schuster is coming.

187
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,960
"Of the century"? Couldn't you
have just said "of the decade"?

188
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
All right, all right.

189
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,920
- And why a bowling alley?
- Please, make a contribution here.

190
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,240
Just open your mind.
The first thing that comes to your mind.

191
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,240
- Potato famine.
- Too Irish.

192
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,880
- A history of agriculture.
- Oh, that's a bestseller.

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,760
- Shedding new light on World War I.
- What's the new light?

194
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:17,400
Write about Picasso.
Everyone loves Picasso.

195
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,080
- I don't.
- Charlemagne?

196
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
- Too French.
- History of the Vatican.

197
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,440
- I'm dying.
- Give me a clue here.

198
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,200
- I'm being self-destructive.
- I gotta call Barbara.

199
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,600
I'm burning bridges, Edith.

200
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,040
They never appreciated you there.

201
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,920
I need lunch.

202
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,200
I'm having a breakdown.

203
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,720
- My gallery show's in three weeks.
- I know.

204
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,160
I don't have time
for the drama now, darling.

205
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,360
Shit.

206
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,200
Dick!

207
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,960
Size 7.

208
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,120
How?

209
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,880
No one knows where he is.
I show up, I've seen him.

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,760
I've seen the snowman.

211
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,960
I send him my de Hory book.

212
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,520
He reads it.

213
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,040
It's a positive portrayal
of a very complex man.

214
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,880
Oh, my God, I get a response.

215
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,640
Correspondence. Sparks fly.
Personal connection.

216
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,200
We become best of friends.
What do you think?

217
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,720
- What is it? What's the book?
- Wait, wait.

218
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,360
Where's Simon and Schuster, Tolstoy?

219
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,920
This is the key to it.

220
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,520
Have a strong, continuous line,
keep the pen on the paper.

221
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,760
Just like that.

222
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,280
All these articles say the same thing.

223
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,760
Hughes runs
a billion-dollar network of companies,

224
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,400
but he only communicates
with handwritten memos.

225
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,440
He doesn't even talk to his top guys.
There's no direct contact anywhere.

226
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
That's why it's gonna work.

227
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,400
Fine. Tell me my dick grew
five inches last night.

228
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,640
I'll still use a ruler.

229
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,560
Howard Hughes?
Howard Hughes, the billionaire?

230
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,960
His exclusive,
authorized autobiography.

231
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,320
He wants Cliff to write it with him.

232
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,600
And they want us to publish it.

233
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,680
Handwriting analysis? Right away.
Can we bring it over right now?

234
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:10,840
"It would not suit me to die without
having stated the truth about my life."

235
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
"My life."

236
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
"I therefore authorize Clifford Irving
to act as intermediary

237
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:20,920
"as to any arrangements regarding
the publishing of my memoir."

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,640
"It would not suit me to die

239
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,720
"without having
certain misconceptions cleared up

240
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,240
"and without having stated
the truth about my life."

241
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,680
So,

242
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,680
taking you at your word...

243
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,440
Yeah.

244
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,600
How does Mr. Hughes propose
we proceed?

245
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I...

246
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,600
Look, this is all very strange.

247
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,080
I'm just getting
the lay of the land here myself.

248
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,240
But what...

249
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,160
What I can gather so far
is that he refuses to go outdoors.

250
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,360
He will only initiate,
never accept, phone calls.

251
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,160
Those two particular rumors
seem to be true.

252
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,600
But he did say that he would provide

253
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,280
handwritten contracts
for legal purposes.

254
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,400
And... Whatever questions you...

255
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,400
You know, you give them to me,

256
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,720
I'll pass them on
when he makes contact with me.

257
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,720
But beyond that,
I don't know what to say, really.

258
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,760
Why you, Cliff?

259
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:26,680
He could have any writer in the world
do this for him.

260
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,240
Albert, I have absolutely no idea.

261
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,000
This is the strangest thing
that has ever happened to me.

262
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,800
Best guess, he likes me.

263
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,800
So, the matching against the reprinted
letters from Newsweek magazine,

264
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,880
Osborn Associates' preliminary opinion

265
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,280
is that the handwriting samples
are genuine.

266
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
- Okay, well, all right...
- Excuse me one second.

267
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,280
Yeah, sure.

268
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Yeah?

269
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,440
- Clifford?
- Yeah?

270
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:10,960
Did you and Howard discuss
how much you both wanted?

271
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,200
Because we would like
to make you an offer today.

272
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,600
We did. We did. We...

273
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,880
We did discuss it.

274
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,040
- Can I weigh in here?
- No.

275
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,320
A man walks in, he says something
completely implausible,

276
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,800
and for that exact reason,
he is believed.

277
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,520
No, it's an Aquarian phenomenon.

278
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,960
- Very, very spiritual.
- Lawyers are not spiritual.

279
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,160
Presumably, this is gonna make news.

280
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,800
Howard Hughes hasn't spoken
to the press in 15 years.

281
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,680
What are you so nervous about?

282
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,080
- You can't think, Dick. No thinking.
- All I'm saying is, once this gets out,

283
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,600
what's gonna stop this guy
from suing our asses off?

284
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,000
Three words. TWA shareholder lawsuit.

285
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,240
Howard has a judgment of
137 million bucks waiting to hit him

286
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,920
if he walks into any courtroom.

287
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,000
So the book comes out,
it doesn't matter. He can't sue.

288
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,560
He can still say it's a fake.

289
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,960
He doesn't say anything
about anything. This guy...

290
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,880
He uses ripped-up Kleenex boxes
for slippers and he drinks his own piss.

291
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
- He's psychotic.
- Have you heard of Intertel?

292
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,960
He has his own private CIA.
Ruthless advisors.

293
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,240
His advisors don't know anything
about the book

294
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,720
because he's too paranoid to tell them.

295
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,200
And he'll never come out of hiding
long enough to denounce me

296
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,040
because he's a lunatic hermit.

297
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,760
And I am the spokesperson
for the lunatic hermit.

298
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,600
So the more outrageous I sound,
the more convincing I am.

299
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,080
Do you believe this, the perfection?

300
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,720
- They offered half a million.
- Half a million dollars?

301
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,040
Four-hundred grand for Howard
and a hundred grand for us!

302
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,720
Oh, I thought you meant
just a half a million for us.

303
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,000
Schmuck, it's all for us.
There is no Howard Hughes.

304
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,040
- Dick, are you paying attention to me?
- Yeah.

305
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,560
The problem is this.

306
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:08,920
It's an oral agreement.

307
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,600
Their lawyers are gonna
jump all over this,

308
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,280
which is why
we have to leave right now.

309
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,080
We gotta become experts
on this man's life.

310
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:18,880
And if we find dirt and it rings true,
the top guys will shove this deal

311
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,960
right down the lawyers' throats.

312
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,160
Cliff,

313
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,520
no visits with special friends, right?

314
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,760
I'm not going to do anything
to jeopardize what we've rebuilt, okay?

315
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,200
You just said to warn you
when you get excited.

316
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
- You seem excited.
- Well...

317
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,000
I love you.

318
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,280
I love you.

319
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,080
Cliff, Howard Hughes' testimony

320
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,560
at the Senate committee hearings
in 1947.

321
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,480
It's got his speech patterns,
his syntax, everything. It's perfect.

322
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,160
Take a picture.

323
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,680
You can't photograph
a government document, it's a felony.

324
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,480
You gonna memorize it?
Take a picture. Take a picture.

325
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,360
I'm a researcher, Cliff.
I am not a jewel thief.

326
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,360
You own 25 percent of this book.

327
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,000
You want it to be good?
You take a picture.

328
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,320
You know, I've always had
a dangerous side.

329
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,800
Barbara has often remarked on it.

330
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,160
But to take down the Library
of Congress. God, the adrenaline.

331
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,840
You took a nice picture
of your leg here.

332
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,200
- Or is that your ankle? I can't tell.
- Where?

333
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,640
Right there.

334
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,200
- It's my ankle.
- It's all out of focus anyway.

335
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,880
- Jesus.
- Want another drink?

336
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,680
- Yeah.
- Yeah, me, too.

337
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,560
Oh, fuck.

338
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:36,680
Harold, this book will sell more copies
than the Bible.

339
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,680
And our competitors will kill to get it,
and if they can't get it,

340
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,600
they will do anything they can
to destroy it.

341
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:47,640
I say we sign this contract immediately,
and institute absolute, total secrecy.

342
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,080
Total. Not even wives can know.

343
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,320
Within reason.

344
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:57,120
From now on,
we refer to Hughes as "Octavio."

345
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,920
The book is called "Project Octavio."

346
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,680
Get Ralph Graves on the phone.

347
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
That's the code name.

348
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,760
I want our journalist friends
to weigh in on this

349
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,440
before I sign
Mr. Hughes' piece of paper.

350
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,040
Look at all this security personnel.

351
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,720
This is a secure facility.

352
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,440
We need the information
in portable form.

353
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,880
Just look comfortable, be buoyant.

354
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,880
Hell, they can let anybody in here.

355
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,280
- What if I'm a Russian?
- Be a buoyant Russian.

356
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:32,080
Records? What for?

357
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,520
You don't know what the hell's going on
with your own company?

358
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,440
Well, to be honest with you, Sergeant,
no, actually, we don't.

359
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,720
Mr. Hughes doesn't like
to share information.

360
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,760
It's very frustrating for us.

361
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,679
You want frustration?

362
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,360
Call Hughes Aircraft and try to find out
when your plane's gonna be ready.

363
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,600
I've seen decorated individuals
sobbing like six-year-old girls

364
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,680
after dealing with you people.

365
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,400
Could my associate
use your facilities, Sergeant?

366
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,720
Could he?

367
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
- Thank you for that.
- To your left.

368
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,160
I'll level with you.
We've had some problems.

369
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,760
Everyone has told us stories
about delays.

370
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,440
Well, I can't get anybody on the phone,
for one thing.

371
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,600
- I had no idea it was this serious.
- It's very serious.

372
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,600
- Frustrating.
- Can you go into any more detail?

373
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,920
Well, the only details I can tell you

374
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,680
is that I've been on the phone
three times today to one girl,

375
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,160
who doesn't know
what she's talking about,

376
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,560
can't tell me when
I'm gonna get my airplanes.

377
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,040
Which office were you talking to?
Do you mind if I write something down?

378
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,240
- Sure.
- This was the complaint department?

379
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,680
- No, acquisitions.
- Acquisitions?

380
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,280
Acquisitions, as far as I know.

381
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,280
My people been dealing with her,
or somebody down there,

382
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,520
for the last three months,
trying to get two aircrafts.

383
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,240
This is an outrage.

384
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,960
An outrage,
the military should be treated that way.

385
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,320
No. No. I'm not doing it.

386
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,400
Hi.

387
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,200
Thank you.

388
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,560
- Hey, Dick. You all right?
- Yeah.

389
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,280
Okay. Keep moving, keep moving.

390
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,800
- Just fine, just fine.
- It's palpitations.

391
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,840
It's okay. A little bit more,
a little bit more. Keep moving.

392
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,480
Sit down here. That's good.

393
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,880
You all right?

394
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,760
You're fine. You're fine.

395
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,200
Fight or flight. It's an animal thing.

396
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,600
It's like you're being chased
by a cheetah or something.

397
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,720
Okay, okay. I'll be fine.

398
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,640
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

399
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
Look, Noah Dietrich, on the right.

400
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,840
Howard Hughes' right-hand man
for over 30 years.

401
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,720
Retired to Vegas.
The other guy, I don't know.

402
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,880
Vegas?

403
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,680
You know, my guess is this guy,
Dietrich, is going to be really cagey.

404
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,760
Information?
Las Vegas, Nevada, please.

405
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,440
Hello?
Mr. Dietrich?

406
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,800
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you at home.

407
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,080
My name is Clifford Irving
and I'm writing a book

408
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,200
about the history of aviation.

409
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,480
I'd be really grateful if you'd share
some of your expertise with me.

410
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,640
Oh, great. Come on over.

411
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,600
You like geranium tea?

412
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,840
It helps your bowels. Follow me.

413
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,920
Watch your step.

414
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,200
- Hey, you're a writer.
- Yes, I am.

415
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,040
I should show you something.

416
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,720
This is an account
of my years at Tool Co.

417
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,440
You know Tool Co.?
Howard Hughes' company.

418
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,800
Has anyone seen this?

419
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,600
Nobody's seen it. It's sensitive.

420
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,160
Listen, I'll come right to the point.

421
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,880
I'll give you $500
to clean up the grammar,

422
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,840
'cause I'm bad with spelling.

423
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:05,880
Yeah, well, I'd have to read it first.
When can I get it back to you?

424
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,080
No, no, no,
I can't let it out of the house.

425
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,040
Why don't you read it right now,
sitting here?

426
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,720
- Now?
- Now.

427
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,040
Right here? Okay.

428
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,360
- Take your time. See you later.
- Thank you.

429
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:31,160
You know what this is?
Do you understand what this means?

430
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,040
- This is exactly... It's gold.
- It's perfect.

431
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,400
We have to find a way
to get it out of the house.

432
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,000
Copy, we need a copy.

433
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,880
Okay, get up. Stand in front of me.
Come over here.

434
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,280
- It's great in the water!
- Keep smiling. What's he doing?

435
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,560
- Oh, yeah.
- Tell me if he can see it.

436
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,040
Grab it.

437
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,960
Tell your friend to come in.
The water's beautiful.

438
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:53,600
Copy that and get back here,
right away.

439
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,520
Thank you!

440
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,280
Sit down, sit down. Thank you.

441
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,040
All right? Are you ready?

442
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,320
All right. I'm done.

443
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,120
Sir, honesty is my policy.

444
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,360
This is atrocious. It's not publishable.

445
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,600
It's run-on sentences,
it's mangled verbiage...

446
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,160
I'm very sorry.

447
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,800
This is badly spelled gossip
from someone absolutely in the know.

448
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,280
This is perfect. Perfect! Oh, my...

449
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,560
You know what we should
do? Let's give Andrea some good news.

450
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,640
This is amazing.
Everybody hates Howard Hughes.

451
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,200
They call him cheap, everything else.

452
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,920
But, you know, they're in his thrall.
They can't stop talking about him.

453
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,720
He's Howard Hughes.
Who the fuck are they?

454
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,280
Listen. "He rarely took vacations.

455
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,680
"But when he did,
he usually booked a remote hotel

456
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,880
"in the Juchitan mountains
called the Salina Cruz."

457
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,560
- Remote. R-E-M-O-A-T. Vacation...
- I'm going for a walk.

458
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,280
- I'll be back in a little bit.
- Okay.

459
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,000
What is it?

460
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,440
Look, you told me
not to call you ever again, so I didn't.

461
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,920
- I say a lot of stupid things, you know?
- Yeah.

462
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,720
It was funny seeing you the other night.

463
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:06,320
I would have given anything
to get this call a year ago.

464
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:11,080
- It's too late. I...
- Clifford...

465
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,880
- You ran out of time. Sorry.
- Clifford, wait. I need to see you.

466
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:14,960
Bye.

467
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,800
Cliff, listen to this.
This is from the Dietrich manuscript.

468
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,440
There's a full transcription here of a
conversation between Howard Hughes

469
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,280
and Frank McCullough
from Time magazine.

470
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,440
They mention Intertel, the Mormon guy,
George Gordon Holmes.

471
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,880
- It's fantastic.
- Stop, listen to me.

472
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,280
- Nina called from New York last night.
- Oh, here we go.

473
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:56,080
Dick, it took me a year
to make things right with Edith.

474
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,080
- Keep an eye on me, will you?
- Keep an eye?

475
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,000
It's my second profession.

476
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,040
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

477
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,480
Cliff...

478
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,920
I've been talking to Barbara,

479
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,000
and she's found some kind of
publishing contract.

480
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,480
And I was wondering
if maybe we could talk about,

481
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,880
you know, some kind of credit deal,

482
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,400
or just some more money for me.

483
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,880
You're not happy
with what we talked about?

484
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,160
- No, no, no, it's not that.
- What? What is it?

485
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,720
Well, it's just like...
I sort of feel that, you know...

486
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,920
Don't answer that! Don't...

487
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,640
Hello, darling. It's Ms. Tate calling.
We have a bit of a problem.

488
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:43,560
- Andrea thinks it's just me...
- Hello! Hi, Andrea, this...

489
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,480
- Who is this?
- You can't say her name.

490
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,680
- This is Dick.
- No, no, don't give your name.

491
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,200
Dick Suskind.

492
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,120
Dick, how do you know my name?

493
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:55,200
- Don't tell her!
- Cliff mentioned you.

494
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,840
What are you doing out there
with Clifford?

495
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:04,920
- I am the...
- Co-coordinator of...

496
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,200
- I'm the coauthor of Project Octavio.
- Excuse me?

497
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,120
- Is Cliff there?
- Yes, certainly. He's right here.

498
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:16,480
- Put him on the phone, please.
- I didn't know what else to say.

499
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,360
- I heard you talking...
- I know what you're doing.

500
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,920
- I know what you're doing.
- What?

501
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,920
I know what you're doing.

502
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,040
Hi, Andrea.

503
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,720
Who the hell was that, Clifford?

504
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,840
That is my associate.

505
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,800
I was intending
to talk to you about him.

506
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,680
He's working with me on this.

507
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,840
All right. You need to be in New York
at 9:00 on Monday morning.

508
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,680
You're meeting with Ralph Graves.

509
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,320
He's the editor-in-chief
of Life magazine.

510
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,640
Yeah, I know who he is.

511
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,040
You need to go over all your contacts
with Octavio.

512
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,640
Life knows a lot about him, so get
your memory clear and be specific.

513
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,400
I don't want to lose the deal
over their knee-jerk suspicions.

514
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,120
What do you... Wait, wait, wait.
What do you mean, "lose the deal"?

515
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,720
What suspicions?

516
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,000
Just tell them the truth.

517
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,440
He gave me a prune.
He gave me a prune.

518
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,360
Visualize the Mediterranean
or something.

519
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,320
You're sweating like an animal.

520
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,280
You know, it's pretty nervy
of these publishers

521
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,600
to put us through this inquisition.

522
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,080
Well, you can't sit it out now.
You're a coauthor.

523
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,560
History.

524
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,520
Quite a responsibility.

525
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,520
The second handwriting analysis
told us

526
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:42,360
your letters from Mr. Hughes
are authentic.

527
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,720
100 percent.
No surprise there.

528
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,400
Experts want to provide their employers
with good news.

529
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,920
He gave me a prune.

530
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,440
What?

531
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,080
Right... In a bag.

532
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:07,160
He gave me a prune. Howard Hughes.

533
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,920
Dick is jumping forward a little bit.
It was a memorable moment for him.

534
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,680
- Anyway, Ralph, how can we help?
- You know, no one likes to be accused.

535
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:18,080
I really don't think anyone's
making accusations here, Dick.

536
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,800
Are we going to stand around all day
looking at photographs?

537
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,800
We came here to talk about
Howard Hughes. Let's talk about him.

538
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,040
He gave me a prune.

539
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,960
Howard Hughes gave me a prune
on the beach at Nassau.

540
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,760
I thought you met Hughes
the first time in Mexico.

541
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,520
Ralph, what happened was this.
I got a phone call.

542
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,160
Really, out of the blue.

543
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,560
From a man
named George Gordon Holmes.

544
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,760
Longtime associate of Howard Hughes.

545
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,560
He says he wants us
to fly down to Mexico City,

546
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:49,880
wait for a call,
so we go ahead and do this.

547
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,240
We fly down there,
we check into this fleabag hotel.

548
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,000
Eighteen hours we wait,
no air conditioning,

549
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,040
sand crabs in the bathtub,
I say, "The hell with him,"

550
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,760
when we spot an envelope,

551
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,880
shoved under the door.

552
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,320
He rarely went on vacation,
but when he did,

553
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,800
he usually booked into a remote hotel

554
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,279
- in the mountains of Juchitan.
- It says,

555
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,000
"There's a pilot waiting
to take you to Juchitan."

556
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,760
So it's 6:00 a.m.,
we're flying low over the mountains,

557
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,240
and I'm nervous.

558
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,040
But he's got a touch, this bush pilot.

559
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,720
He brings it right down
onto a gray pebble landing strip.

560
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,480
Just as it comes down,
I see out of the corner of my eye,

561
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,400
there's a jeep that's coming down
from the mountains.

562
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
Mexican military?

563
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,320
No.

564
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
It's Holmes.

565
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,040
- Mr. Irving?
- Yes, that's right. Mr. Holmes?

566
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,080
- Who is this?
- Dick Suskind, sir.

567
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,280
So, he's a little surprised to see Dick,

568
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,640
but I explained that Dick
was my researcher and friend,

569
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,920
and that's why he was there
and I couldn't do without him.

570
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,040
We get in the jeep,

571
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,440
and he takes us on this endless ride,
up through the mountains.

572
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,520
We circled around the top of this hill
and we got to the hotel,

573
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,360
which was called

574
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,560
Salina Cruz.

575
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,200
Holmes motions for us to follow.

576
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,080
It's quiet.

577
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,800
There's a room
way in the back, like a hut.

578
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,480
Doesn't even have
a view of the ocean.

579
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,640
We can barely see.

580
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:34,320
There's a little slip of a man on a bed,
sitting like a monk.

581
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,800
Howard Hughes.

582
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,840
Howard Hughes.

583
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,920
Howard Hughes is sitting right there.

584
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,000
My heart...

585
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,360
And then he was reaching out
through the mosquito netting,

586
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,000
and he offered Dick a...

587
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,480
A prune.

588
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,040
A prune.

589
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,000
Dick takes the prune,

590
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,640
eats the prune...

591
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,680
Not bad.

592
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,400
And he started talking about
the extraordinary value of Mexican soil,

593
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,280
organic farming, organic food,
et cetera, et cetera.

594
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,800
The two of them started jabbering
like old friends.

595
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:40,840
We ended up talking a little bit about
business, then Dick and I went home.

596
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,600
- I'm a little hungry.
- Let's eat.

597
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,080
Ralph, will you pick
something fabulous?

598
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
The Latour please, '61.

599
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,560
- That'll get us started. Thank you.
- Oh, yes.

600
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,560
And some beluga,
shall we, gentlemen?

601
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,880
Sounds good.

602
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,720
You know, Howard Hughes
doesn't like caviar.

603
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
Really?

604
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,800
Really. In fact, he made a special point
of saying so.

605
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,400
I remember that. I...

606
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,120
It was such a non sequitur.
It was a strange thing.

607
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,880
It was just after Clifford
finished talking about the...

608
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,880
- The crash.
- That's right. The crash.

609
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,520
The one in Beverly Hills.
He nearly hit the top of that house,

610
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:21,640
parked it right on top of the house, hurt
his back, but he walked away from it.

611
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,800
And he said that people
in Beverly Hills eat caviar,

612
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,720
and he doesn't like it
and then he crashed his plane.

613
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:35,000
Okay, then let's make it
two beluga appetizers, please.

614
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:38,960
- Three maybe.
- Three, yeah. Make it three.

615
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,200
- Andrea, yeah?
- Thank you. Okay. Good.

616
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:46,280
Did you get any sense
of his business acumen?

617
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,160
Go ahead.

618
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,520
It's interesting. He said that...

619
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:55,640
Very interesting. He said that people
often think of business as business,

620
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,920
which of course it is, but also...
Within business, there is also pleasure.

621
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,200
You know, business is pleasure.
Pleasure can be a business.

622
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,600
Business has pleasure.
It's both. It's both at the same time.

623
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:07,840
I didn't really understand it,
but after a while it sunk in,

624
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:12,360
and I realized, you know,
that's his genius.

625
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,480
This is your check for writing services.

626
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:28,160
The second check for Mr. Hughes,
or, Octavio, sorry...

627
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,960
It's gonna take
a little longer to process.

628
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,200
I understand you're authorized
to receive Mr. Hughes' payment?

629
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,400
Yeah, I am, I am, thank you.
But don't take too long, all right?

630
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,400
Life magazine is prepared
to offer $250,000

631
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:44,640
for worldwide exclusive rights
to serialize the Howard Hughes story.

632
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,600
That's a record, Harold.

633
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,960
I'm wondering if it's enough of a record,
Ralph.

634
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,440
Oh, jeez.
The money makes this real.

635
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,960
You can still back out,
but you gotta tell me now.

636
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,040
- Back out?
- Yeah.

637
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,520
Fuck, no!
We're the goddamn Musketeers.

638
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,040
Good. That's good.
Don't spend any money, though.

639
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,880
Better we keep it for later,
in case we need it.

640
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,000
Absolutely.

641
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:14,560
In other news,
the Supreme Court has agreed to hear

642
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:18,960
the TWA shareholders' case against
reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes.

643
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,320
A loss could cost Hughes
$137,000,000

644
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,480
and devastate his financial empire.

645
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,320
The Nixon Justice Department
has thus far refused...

646
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,560
We gotta reach big.

647
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,520
We'll go for texture, gritty details,
we need blood, we need money,

648
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,520
we need real juicy,
Shakespearean, big stuff...

649
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,240
You want to critique a sitting president
who's also a war criminal?

650
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,440
- No, no, no.
- You can do anything you want.

651
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,440
You can impact culture
with something like this.

652
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,480
"Impact culture." I want to make
some money and not get caught.

653
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,280
You know,
we've got to make this plausible.

654
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,680
Dick, I handed them
three yellow letters.

655
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,640
They gave me $500,000.
Is that plausible?

656
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,280
I don't think so.

657
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,600
- You want to get a drink?
- Okay.

658
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,040
I'm gonna change my shirt.
I'll be right out.

659
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:03,160
- I'm heading home.
- You go. I'm sticking for a while.

660
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,040
- See you, Tom.
- Good night.

661
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,200
- Tommy, can I use your phone?
- Yeah, sure, go right ahead.

662
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,360
I saw Elmyr a few months ago in Ibiza.

663
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:37,080
So, how is our old friend Elmyr?

664
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,280
Well, I was having dinner with friends,

665
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,040
and he was at the bar,
sitting all alone, drinking.

666
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,520
He came up to me and he said,

667
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:47,800
"I have always found your affair with
Clifford to be common and immoral."

668
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:49,360
And he stormed out.

669
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,920
You're lying. Elmyr didn't say that.

670
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,000
Oh, I'm the liar?

671
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,000
And who's writing a fake book about
the most famous man in the world?

672
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,080
Gotta get back.

673
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,680
No! No, the clock is broken. You stay.

674
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,760
Just to confirm,

675
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,000
he's still rich
and you're still not gonna leave him.

676
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,680
Oh, I want to, Cliff, I want to.

677
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,200
But, no, I'm not going to.

678
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,360
I'm shallow, Cliff.

679
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,440
My greatest desire
is to be an American movie star.

680
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,200
- How shallow is that?
- Pretty shallow.

681
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,600
And besides, why does it bother you
so much that I'm your mistress?

682
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,160
Brecht, Hemingway,
they all had mistresses.

683
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,800
The lying gives me a headache,
if you want to know the truth.

684
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:47,240
Oh, I forgot. You're a devoted husband.

685
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,240
I think I forgot
while you were screwing me.

686
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,840
Sorry.

687
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,000
Sorry.
I know I should have not called you.

688
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,720
I'm not gonna go through
this whole thing again.

689
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:05,600
I can't do it to her. I can't.

690
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,920
I'll see you next time?

691
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,040
Oh, Dick, Nina!
There's no future with her.

692
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,040
- She weakens me.
- Okay, all right. That's very helpful.

693
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,520
Edith is stability, Dick. She's my rock.

694
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
Give me a break, will you, please?

695
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,080
Did you tell Nina about the book?

696
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,080
Are you out of your fucking mind?

697
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,760
I've got the "I'm an asshole" part
down pretty good.

698
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,080
It's the "What do I do now?" part
I need help with.

699
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,120
Please? Be my friend?

700
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
- Are you my friend?
- Yeah, I'm your friend.

701
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,760
I don't know what I'm gonna do
if she asks me where I went.

702
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,440
Come clean.

703
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,760
She'll leave me, for good.

704
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,160
It's the best I got.
What else can I tell you?

705
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,160
You wanna hear this?

706
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,360
Yeah.

707
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,840
All right,
this is the Senate hearings, 1947.

708
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:02,040
I'm not even sure
that's a correct statement,

709
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,520
but the fact remains
that if I made 15 million dollars,

710
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,000
I made it selling oil well tools
and beer,

711
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:13,080
Grand Prize beer,
to people down in Texas.

712
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,840
"Beer down in Texas."

713
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,000
And I don't think the public
should be led to believe...

714
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,760
"Led to believe."

715
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,920
...on war contracts while I did not.
Now, furthermore...

716
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,760
"Now, furthermore..."

717
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:29,080
- "Furthermore, Senator..."
- "Furthermore..."

718
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,240
...a little money somewhere.
How could I put nine million dollars...

719
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,800
A little pocket change

720
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,920
worth five million dollars in my pocket.

721
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,160
Mr. Hughes, where would you
like to begin?

722
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:45,840
- Family, friends, father...
- Yeah.

723
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,760
My father. We'll do father.

724
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:56,400
People called my father Big Howard.

725
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,360
Big Howard...

726
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:04,840
Big Howard made his money
leasing drilling bits in the oil business.

727
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,400
He said to me... He said, "Sonny..."

728
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,920
"Sonny, these drill bits
are your bread and butter.

729
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,760
"Don't ever let 'em go."

730
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:23,880
Big Howard died when I was 18.

731
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:32,200
His bunch of Texas roughneck friends
tried to sell his company.

732
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,440
Pushed me out of the picture.
I don't like being pushed.

733
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:44,920
Now, when two parties negotiate,
you got a lion and a donkey.

734
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,960
One party, through bluster or leverage,

735
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,720
claims control of
the situation right away. That's the lion.

736
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,120
At 18,

737
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:03,320
I sued these men
trying to sell my father's company.

738
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,840
I sued them, I attacked them,
I blackmailed them,

739
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:09,440
I pushed every which way I could!

740
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,240
I learned to be a lion.

741
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,640
Jesus, Cliff.

742
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,080
- Read the women's rags lately?
- Hi.

743
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:43,600
Excerpts from
Howard Hughes' autobiography

744
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,240
in Ladies Home Journal
from the book by Robert Eaton.

745
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,960
Life's lawyers are gnawing
the flesh from my bones.

746
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:55,079
Would you like to tell me, Clifford,
what the fuck is going on here?

747
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,280
I don't know anything about this.

748
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,320
This goddamn Eaton
supposedly has memos,

749
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,480
the same handwritten memos
that you've got, so...

750
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,760
Either you're selling this twice and
using Robert Eaton as a pen name...

751
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,880
I won't even dignify that
with a response.

752
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:12,240
Or, more likely, your demigod
lunatic friend is using two writers.

753
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:13,360
You get it?

754
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,440
All the sharks at my company
have is you,

755
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:20,120
which means they will sue your skinny
ass for every cent of the advance,

756
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:22,760
plus damages,
for making false representations...

757
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,080
No, I made no false representations!

758
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,040
...about an exclusive book
you said you could deliver.

759
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,720
So she said that they said
that they would sue us both?

760
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:30,800
- Yeah.
- Both of us?

761
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
- I mean, she mentioned me by name?
- Yes.

762
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,080
Can you believe this son of a bitch
had the same idea?

763
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,920
But I spent the money.

764
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:40,320
I told you we might have to give it back!
Jeez, Dick.

765
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,680
Well, it wasn't exactly
a huge percentage to begin with.

766
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,920
Look, just pay the money.

767
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,880
Tell them that Hughes
has changed his mind.

768
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,560
- And I'll owe you the difference.
- I can't. I'm down most of it myself.

769
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:53,920
Yeah, well, borrow it.
This isn't a prank anymore, Cliff.

770
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,800
If they go to the press with this,

771
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,160
we're gonna have
Howard fucking Hughes chasing us.

772
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,400
And Intertel.

773
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:02,200
Remember, they'll stab us
with sodium pentothal?

774
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:05,840
They'll kill us or tie us up or something.

775
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:10,000
Howard won't be coming after us.
His advisors maybe, but he won't.

776
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,120
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

777
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,720
- What, he tell you that over breakfast?
- Yeah.

778
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:14,840
And what about this other book?
What if that's the real thing, huh?

779
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,480
You thought about that?

780
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,000
All right, the question is,

781
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:20,120
what would Howard do
in a situation like this?

782
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,320
I don't know. Buy a fucking airline.

783
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,720
Diversion, end run, surprise.

784
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,720
Who are you now? General Patton?

785
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,600
Viruses and bacteria
are the most powerful enemies...

786
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:41,240
Luce.

787
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,200
...the human body has got.
You look at the fingernail clippings...

788
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:46,960
Henry Luce.

789
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,680
Dick, I think you should
take a little holiday.

790
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,640
You got everything?
You got your passport?

791
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,120
- You got the letter? Okay, great.
- Yeah, I'm fine...

792
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,680
You're gonna be fine. Bye.

793
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,560
- Hello, this is Andrea.
- Yeah, Andrea, it's Cliff.

794
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,840
Yeah, one more thing, Shelton Fisher
needs to be at the meeting.

795
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,120
Do you know who he is?

796
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,800
Chairman of McGraw-Hill, yes.

797
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,080
- Has to be at the meeting.
- All right, I'll see what I can do.

798
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,960
It's not me. It's him.
No negotiation. No Fisher, no meeting.

799
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:58,480
Mr. Irving, it would appear
that either you

800
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:02,200
or your illustrious sponsor
is jerking someone's chain.

801
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,200
Let me assure you that chain
will not be connected to Life magazine.

802
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:11,560
So, why don't you begin by telling us
who Robert Eaton is

803
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:15,080
and why he's selling the book
you're supposed to be writing?

804
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,840
Shelton, have you received
your mail today?

805
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,360
Excuse me?

806
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,000
Ralph, I was talking to Shelton.

807
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:28,600
As a side comment,
watch your tone with me.

808
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,040
I've been up for two nights negotiating
with a very stubborn billionaire,

809
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,680
and my quota for verbal abuse
has been reached.

810
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,120
Could you get the mail, please?

811
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,040
Life magazine has been known

812
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:46,360
to have a slight impact
on writers' careers, my friend.

813
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:50,040
And we...
We are not afraid of civil litigation.
