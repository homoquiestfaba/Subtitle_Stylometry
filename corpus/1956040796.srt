00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,048
Good afternoon, Miss Ocean.

3
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:35,081
Hi.

4
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,818
As you know,
parole is a privilege.

5
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,554
And one of the restrictions
on any parolee,

6
00:00:40,556 --> 00:00:42,088
is to avoid the company

7
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,158
of any person who has
a criminal record of any kind.

8
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,328
That would include
most of your extended family.

9
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:50,230
Yeah, that's obviously
not something I'm proud of.

10
00:00:50,232 --> 00:00:53,566
Would this pose an impossible
challenge for you?

11
00:00:53,568 --> 00:00:55,002
No. No.

12
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:58,405
I don't want that life.
I never wanted that life.

13
00:00:58,407 --> 00:01:00,273
My brother, um...

14
00:01:00,275 --> 00:01:01,575
May he rest in peace,

15
00:01:01,577 --> 00:01:03,710
was a criminal.

16
00:01:03,712 --> 00:01:05,513
I loved him,

17
00:01:05,515 --> 00:01:06,813
but he was a conman.

18
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:08,081
It was in his blood.

19
00:01:08,083 --> 00:01:09,949
- And it's not in your blood?
- No.

20
00:01:09,951 --> 00:01:11,485
No, sir.

21
00:01:11,487 --> 00:01:13,021
Um...

22
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:15,759
I fell for the wrong person.

23
00:01:16,725 --> 00:01:18,158
It was a mistake.

24
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,426
Uh...

25
00:01:19,428 --> 00:01:20,963
But it happened.

26
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,035
And if I were to be released,
I would, um...

27
00:01:28,404 --> 00:01:30,705
Sorry.

28
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:32,839
Wow, just saying that...

29
00:01:35,111 --> 00:01:37,878
If I were to be released,

30
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,113
I would just want
the simple life.

31
00:01:40,115 --> 00:01:42,449
I just wanna hold down a job,

32
00:01:42,451 --> 00:01:44,985
make some friends,

33
00:01:44,987 --> 00:01:48,157
go for a walk after work
in the fresh air

34
00:01:49,225 --> 00:01:52,092
and pay my bills.

35
00:02:08,778 --> 00:02:10,744
Simple life?

36
00:02:10,746 --> 00:02:11,911
Nice one.

37
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,679
- Heard about that?
- Who didn't?

38
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,883
I had five years
to rehearse it.

39
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,787
- Here's your stuff.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:23,558
Nice watch.

41
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,360
- It's my brother's.
- Left it to you?

42
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:27,994
I stole it.

43
00:02:27,996 --> 00:02:30,331
It's fine, Dina.
He stole it, too.

44
00:02:30,333 --> 00:02:32,398
So we're still gonna get
a regular shipment next week.

45
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,302
You take your cut, plus
a few extra cartons, okay?

46
00:02:35,304 --> 00:02:38,004
I want you to trade 'em,
not smoke 'em.

47
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:39,839
<i>So where you going?</i>

48
00:02:39,841 --> 00:02:42,844
<i>Well, I have 45 bucks, Dina.</i>

49
00:02:42,846 --> 00:02:44,781
<i>I can go anywhere I want.</i>

50
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:54,881
Hi, I'd like to return these.

51
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,415
Oh, of course.
Do you have your receipt?

52
00:03:56,417 --> 00:03:58,452
No, but they're unopened.
They haven't been touched.

53
00:03:58,454 --> 00:04:00,286
I really need your receipt.

54
00:04:00,288 --> 00:04:02,389
They are sealed.
They are brand new.

55
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:04,258
Do you have
the credit card that you used?

56
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,760
This is ridiculous!
I bought these last week.

57
00:04:06,762 --> 00:04:08,629
Ma'am, you can try client
services on the sixth floor.

58
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,599
You know what? Never mind.
I'll just keep 'em.

59
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:13,033
Jesus.

60
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:14,469
Can I at least get a bag?

61
00:04:14,471 --> 00:04:15,472
Sure.

62
00:04:18,574 --> 00:04:19,909
Thank you.

63
00:04:30,219 --> 00:04:33,186
Hi. I'm checking out
of room 2814. Gary Randall.

64
00:04:33,188 --> 00:04:35,324
- Did you have a pleasant stay?
- Terrific.

65
00:04:36,825 --> 00:04:38,157
My name is Monica.

66
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,459
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

67
00:04:39,461 --> 00:04:40,594
Or arrange transportation?

68
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:42,830
I think we're all set.

69
00:04:42,832 --> 00:04:44,431
<i>Hi,
this is Mrs. Randall.</i>

70
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,166
<i>We just checked out
of room 2814.</i>

71
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:47,767
<i>May I speak
with Monica, please?</i>

72
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:49,469
- <i>This is she.</i>
- Hi, Monica.

73
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:50,637
- Hi.
- Hi.

74
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,606
Uh, we just found out
our flight was canceled.

75
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:56,008
- Oh, no!
- I know, I know.

76
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,210
And instead of staying

77
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,712
in some
horrible airport hotel,

78
00:04:58,714 --> 00:04:59,981
we were hoping that maybe

79
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,582
we could get
our original room back?

80
00:05:01,584 --> 00:05:03,450
Yeah, we can give you
that same room back.

81
00:05:03,452 --> 00:05:06,354
That would be amazing!
Thank you so much!

82
00:05:06,356 --> 00:05:08,856
<i>Um, we're just
gonna go grab a bite.</i>

83
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,957
<i>Would it be possible
to get the maid in there now?</i>

84
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,291
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

85
00:05:12,293 --> 00:05:14,228
<i>Perfect.
We really appreciate it.</i>

86
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,729
<i>It's not a problem.</i>

87
00:05:15,731 --> 00:05:17,531
<i>Thank you so much.
We'll see you soon.</i>

88
00:05:28,577 --> 00:05:29,976
Hi.

89
00:05:29,978 --> 00:05:31,344
I'm so sorry.
Can you finish up later?

90
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:32,746
I just have
to get off my feet.

91
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,214
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

92
00:05:34,216 --> 00:05:35,649
- Have a great day.
- You, too!

93
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,287
Bye-bye.

94
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,291
<i>And he did not move in!</i>

95
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:18,959
<i>And he wants his money back.</i>

96
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,861
<i>And he gets his money back.</i>

97
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:24,263
<i>If you said no, does that mean
you didn't take the money?</i>

98
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:25,931
What crate are you on?

99
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,135
15.

100
00:06:27,902 --> 00:06:29,335
<i>Listen.</i>

101
00:06:29,337 --> 00:06:30,837
<i>You think I like you?
You think I believe you?</i>

102
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:32,839
<i>You think I trust anything
that you're saying?</i>

103
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:34,909
<i>The answer is absolutely not.</i>

104
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,978
Guys, it's 9:30.

105
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:42,849
It's too much.
It's too much.

106
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:44,717
It's three fingers
from the top.

107
00:06:44,719 --> 00:06:47,053
Not one, it's three.

108
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:48,955
It's a rerun, April.

109
00:06:48,957 --> 00:06:51,123
She slept with her cousin,
crashed the car.

110
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,825
The baby's not his.

111
00:06:52,827 --> 00:06:54,496
What's that taste like?

112
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,229
Vodka.

113
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,767
Vodka. Exactly.
But I don't want vodka.

114
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:02,068
I want vodka and water.

115
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:04,537
- And do you wanna know why?
- Uh, sure.

116
00:07:04,539 --> 00:07:07,373
'Cause when you're drunk,
it tastes like vodka.

117
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,279
- Right.
- Right.

118
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:12,912
<i>I don't care!</i>

119
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:43,980
Oh, missed you, too.

120
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:04,798
You better be in there.

121
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:10,803
I know you're there, Reuben.

122
00:08:10,805 --> 00:08:12,007
You can come on out.

123
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:18,212
I was just paying my respects.

124
00:08:18,214 --> 00:08:19,649
From around the corner?

125
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:22,248
What are you doing here?

126
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,918
They thought I'd be
the best one to talk to you.

127
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,320
Hmm. Gotta go.

128
00:08:27,322 --> 00:08:30,323
He didn't want you
to do this, Deborah.

129
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:31,558
Do what?

130
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,726
Whatever it is he wouldn't
tell us you're gonna do.

131
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:35,229
- Look, Deb.
- Mmm.

132
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:38,965
Sometimes, just knowing
the job will work

133
00:08:38,967 --> 00:08:41,600
is satisfaction enough.

134
00:08:41,602 --> 00:08:44,272
You don't actually
gotta do it.

135
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:49,075
What else did he say?

136
00:08:49,077 --> 00:08:51,411
- He said it was brilliant.
- Oh, okay.

137
00:08:51,413 --> 00:08:54,381
And that you would probably
end up back in prison.

138
00:08:54,383 --> 00:08:56,719
I'm not gonna end up
back in prison.

139
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,886
Okay?

140
00:09:03,091 --> 00:09:04,526
I gotta go.

141
00:09:06,962 --> 00:09:08,360
Be careful.

142
00:09:08,362 --> 00:09:10,797
You're looking sharp.

143
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:27,113
- Mmm!
- Hey, hey! Take it easy.

144
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:28,415
Been in the slammer.

145
00:09:28,417 --> 00:09:30,186
Oh, I just thought
you changed your number.

146
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,152
Did you
get the credit line?

147
00:09:33,154 --> 00:09:36,089
- Not yet.
- Why not?

148
00:09:36,091 --> 00:09:38,157
Because I don't know
what it's for.

149
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:39,359
Oh, my God!

150
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,828
Don't do that.

151
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,896
Do what?

152
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:45,398
That would be my "I've just
been in jail for five years,

153
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,633
"and my partner
lets me down" face.

154
00:09:46,635 --> 00:09:50,106
Hey, I'm not your partner.
Yet.

155
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,105
This is nice.

156
00:09:53,107 --> 00:09:55,809
Chain-link, barb wire.

157
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:57,380
Brought you something.

158
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:01,514
Oh, um...

159
00:10:01,516 --> 00:10:03,682
Can I exchange
something you stole?

160
00:10:03,684 --> 00:10:05,417
Well, if you're gonna
have a problem with stealing,

161
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:07,253
you're not gonna like
the rest of this conversation.

162
00:10:07,255 --> 00:10:09,189
- What, we're gonna shoplift?
- Maybe.

163
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,590
No. See, this is what you do.

164
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:12,591
You make me guess and then,
I'm interested.

165
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,295
- Okay.
- And then you think because

166
00:10:14,297 --> 00:10:15,695
I'm interested,
that I wanna do it.

167
00:10:15,697 --> 00:10:17,464
Don't you wanna do things
you're interested in?

168
00:10:17,466 --> 00:10:18,764
I'm interested
in brain surgery.

169
00:10:18,766 --> 00:10:20,600
Well, we know
that's not gonna happen.

170
00:10:20,602 --> 00:10:22,502
Whatever.
You don't wanna tell me...

171
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:24,740
It's jewels.

172
00:10:27,208 --> 00:10:30,042
Spectacular,
great, big, blingy,

173
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:31,543
big old Liz Taylor jewels,

174
00:10:31,545 --> 00:10:34,784
that are locked in a vault
50 feet underground.

175
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,219
How do we get them
out of the vault?

176
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,256
They're gonna bring 'em to us.

177
00:10:43,192 --> 00:10:45,461
Oh, bugger!

178
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,863
Oh.

179
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,263
Nice place.

180
00:10:51,265 --> 00:10:52,766
Try heating it.

181
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:55,201
There's a room
for you upstairs.

182
00:10:55,203 --> 00:10:58,104
Your stuff's upstairs, too.

183
00:10:58,106 --> 00:10:59,605
You know,
I borrowed some shit.

184
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:01,710
Figured you weren't using it.

185
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:36,377
So,
is this your gallery?

186
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:37,442
- Yeah, one of them.
- Hmm.

187
00:11:37,444 --> 00:11:39,211
Where are the others?

188
00:11:39,213 --> 00:11:40,580
Well, I'm opening
one in London.

189
00:11:40,582 --> 00:11:42,215
Got plans
for another one in Tokyo.

190
00:11:42,217 --> 00:11:43,316
We're talking about LA,

191
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:44,685
but I'm not sure
that makes sense.

192
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,085
It's all a bit derivative
out there, you know?

193
00:11:46,087 --> 00:11:48,220
So this is
the only one that exists?

194
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:50,726
Well... Physically.

195
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:55,665
Excuse me one second.

196
00:11:56,231 --> 00:11:57,799
Sorry. Sorry.

197
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,937
Oh, my God.

198
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,605
I was meaning to call you.

199
00:12:05,607 --> 00:12:08,608
Jesus, it's great to see you.
You look...

200
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:10,142
Recently incarcerated?

201
00:12:10,144 --> 00:12:12,711
Wonderful. You look wonderful.

202
00:12:12,713 --> 00:12:14,446
Do you know what a shiv is?

203
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:16,883
Okay, stop. Just stop.

204
00:12:16,885 --> 00:12:19,221
Oh, such a nice face.

205
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:22,354
You know, inside,

206
00:12:22,356 --> 00:12:24,424
you're what we call
a pretty girl.

207
00:12:24,426 --> 00:12:26,594
- I'll call the police.
- Okay.

208
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:29,264
Do you know what we do
with snitches?

209
00:12:33,201 --> 00:12:35,368
<i>- He saw you?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

210
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,305
<i>Why would you
do something like that?</i>

211
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,007
Closure?

212
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,244
Bullshit!

213
00:12:44,112 --> 00:12:45,211
Jesus!

214
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:48,516
So did you...

215
00:12:49,051 --> 00:12:50,650
No.

216
00:12:50,652 --> 00:12:52,084
Just a little button.

217
00:13:09,138 --> 00:13:11,772
<i>So at first, I thought
banks. 'Cause you know...</i>

218
00:13:11,774 --> 00:13:13,139
<i>That's where
they have money?</i>

219
00:13:13,141 --> 00:13:15,175
<i>Exactly.
But that's kind of boring.</i>

220
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:17,478
So then I thought ten banks.

221
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,878
Then I realized
that would be maybe

222
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,413
coming from
an angry place so...

223
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:21,882
Good you realized that.

224
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,782
Yes. Then I couldn't
even hear myself think.

225
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,951
You know,
five women in one cell.

226
00:13:25,953 --> 00:13:27,686
So I got myself
thrown in solitary

227
00:13:27,688 --> 00:13:29,823
for a little peace and quiet,

228
00:13:29,825 --> 00:13:32,328
and that's where
I finally came up with it.

229
00:14:02,323 --> 00:14:04,123
- It's still a museum.
- So?

230
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,426
So, it's not like
robbing a liquor store.

231
00:14:08,462 --> 00:14:11,364
I'm sorry,
I don't speak Ukrainian.

232
00:14:11,366 --> 00:14:13,065
I said, "We're
not robbing a museum."

233
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:15,067
We're robbing someone
in a museum.

234
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:16,435
In a museum.

235
00:14:16,437 --> 00:14:18,004
Yeah, you mentioned.

236
00:14:18,006 --> 00:14:19,473
Look.

237
00:14:19,475 --> 00:14:22,175
- Even if this was possible...
- It is possible.

238
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:24,076
Even if it was,
we'd need, like,

239
00:14:24,078 --> 00:14:26,345
20 people
and half a million dollars.

240
00:14:26,347 --> 00:14:27,479
Seven.

241
00:14:27,481 --> 00:14:28,614
Seven million?

242
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,418
Seven people and 20 grand.

243
00:14:32,455 --> 00:14:34,820
Why do you need to do this?

244
00:14:34,822 --> 00:14:36,956
Because it's what I'm good at.

245
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,960
Uh, yeah.

246
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:40,927
You know what?

247
00:14:40,929 --> 00:14:43,397
I have run this thing
a thousand times.

248
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,132
Every time I got caught,
I fixed it.

249
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,932
And in three years, I wasn't
getting caught anymore.

250
00:14:46,934 --> 00:14:49,835
By the time I was paroled,
it was running like clockwork.

251
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,604
Perfectly.

252
00:14:51,606 --> 00:14:54,574
And you were there with me,
every step of the way.

253
00:14:54,576 --> 00:14:56,475
Oh, honey, is this a proposal?

254
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:59,112
Baby, I don't have
a diamond yet.

255
00:14:59,114 --> 00:15:00,747
Come on. Do you
really wanna spend the rest

256
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,382
of your life
watering down well vodka?

257
00:15:02,384 --> 00:15:04,687
Because it's really
kind of a waste.

258
00:15:05,553 --> 00:15:08,421
Come on. Take a bite.

259
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,493
Just take a bite.

260
00:15:11,492 --> 00:15:13,895
- You're really irritating.
- Open.

261
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,598
That's good.

262
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,101
Very good.

263
00:15:22,236 --> 00:15:23,836
<i>So each year they host</i>

264
00:15:23,838 --> 00:15:25,972
<i>the biggest party
in the world.</i>

265
00:15:25,974 --> 00:15:28,508
<i>And they always get
a huge celebrity to host.</i>

266
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,975
<i>This year, it's Daphne Kluger.</i>

267
00:15:29,977 --> 00:15:31,478
<i>Wow!</i>

268
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,845
<i>Yeah.
But she's not our mark.</i>

269
00:15:32,847 --> 00:15:34,046
<i>So who's the mark?</i>

270
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:36,584
All right,
who wants to go first?

271
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:38,417
Yes.

272
00:15:38,419 --> 00:15:39,853
Do you know
who you're wearing?

273
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,153
Uh, ooh...

274
00:15:41,155 --> 00:15:42,589
La Perla. It's black.

275
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,891
No, I mean who's dressing you?

276
00:15:44,893 --> 00:15:46,692
I don't really
know yet.

277
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:48,427
The designer.

278
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:50,397
I don't know yet.

279
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:51,897
But as soon as I do,

280
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:54,100
you'll be the very first
person that I tell.

281
00:15:54,102 --> 00:15:56,037
Uh, next question?

282
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,306
<i>All right,
we need a designer.</i>

283
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:00,574
<i>Exactly!</i>

284
00:16:00,576 --> 00:16:01,874
Now a lot of these
we could target.

285
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,109
But Anna won't approve them,

286
00:16:03,111 --> 00:16:04,643
and Anna
has to approve everything.

287
00:16:04,645 --> 00:16:05,979
I know.

288
00:16:05,981 --> 00:16:07,647
There's a few
less-established choices,

289
00:16:07,649 --> 00:16:09,148
but they're not gonna
give us the juice we need.

290
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,151
So...

291
00:16:11,787 --> 00:16:13,685
Rose Weil.
Why do I know that name?

292
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:15,622
Well, she was big,
in the '90s.

293
00:16:15,624 --> 00:16:17,956
Oh, God, all the Edwardian
collars and the ruffles.

294
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,126
Travesty.
But Anna still likes her.

295
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:22,695
They do Easter together
every year in Kent.

296
00:16:22,697 --> 00:16:23,897
- Brits?
- Irish.

297
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,702
And she owes the IRS
$5 million.

298
00:16:31,505 --> 00:16:32,905
<i>It's bad.</i>

299
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:34,174
<i>There's a lien on her assets,</i>

300
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,374
<i>they've impounded
her passport.</i>

301
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:36,910
<i>The bank seized her townhouse.</i>

302
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,411
<i>She sounds amazing.</i>

303
00:16:38,413 --> 00:16:39,512
<i>Yeah.</i>

304
00:16:39,514 --> 00:16:40,781
<i>I think we got lucky.</i>

305
00:16:40,783 --> 00:16:43,983
<i>She gambled
everything on this.</i>

306
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:47,420
This is a flight to
nowhere without any peanuts.

307
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:50,889
Self-financed.
Credit from an Omaha bank.

308
00:16:50,891 --> 00:16:52,258
Those guys over there?

309
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,527
The only ones
who'll still loan her money.

310
00:16:54,529 --> 00:16:57,129
They look a little worried.

311
00:16:57,131 --> 00:17:00,068
Yeah, who can blame them?
This is a train wreck.

312
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:23,124
Congratulations.

313
00:17:24,994 --> 00:17:26,493
Who are you?

314
00:17:26,495 --> 00:17:27,627
Big fans.

315
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,728
- Very big.
- Oh.

316
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,497
- That was...
- Just...

317
00:17:31,499 --> 00:17:33,332
- Gorgeous.
- Mmm-hmm.

318
00:17:33,334 --> 00:17:35,004
No, it wasn't.

319
00:17:35,704 --> 00:17:37,670
It was a disaster.

320
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:40,572
I think you're being
kind of hard on yourself.

321
00:17:40,574 --> 00:17:41,808
Very.

322
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:44,578
Did you read this?

323
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,445
It's by a blogger.

324
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:47,917
Mmm.

325
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,651
"Rose Weil.

326
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,454
"Her new collection
is like taking a tour

327
00:17:54,456 --> 00:17:55,955
"of your grandmother's closet.

328
00:17:55,957 --> 00:17:58,724
"Just as dated,
and just as musty.

329
00:17:58,726 --> 00:18:01,628
"The Eskimo shove their
elders out on an ice floe.

330
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,728
"Just saying."

331
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,497
That's very cruel.

332
00:18:04,499 --> 00:18:06,465
But it doesn't make it true.

333
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,333
Mmm.

334
00:18:08,335 --> 00:18:09,868
How did I get here?

335
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,138
You spent $18 million
in two years

336
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:14,109
and had two houseboats
on the Seine.

337
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,908
I'm old.

338
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:17,810
Hey, you're not old.

339
00:18:17,812 --> 00:18:20,879
I'm old,
and I'm going to prison.

340
00:18:20,881 --> 00:18:23,483
Then I'm going to be
really, really poor.

341
00:18:23,485 --> 00:18:25,618
Not necessarily.

342
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,423
What if we could
make all this go away?

343
00:18:29,425 --> 00:18:31,927
Even get your passport back.

344
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:36,762
How?

345
00:18:36,764 --> 00:18:39,101
Dress Daphne Kluger
for the Met Ball.

346
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,435
Mmm.

347
00:18:42,437 --> 00:18:44,070
Are you mad?

348
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,472
Mmm-mmm.

349
00:18:45,474 --> 00:18:46,875
No, hang on a minute.

350
00:18:47,976 --> 00:18:49,109
Are you journalists?

351
00:18:49,111 --> 00:18:50,977
- Absolutely not.
- God, no.

352
00:18:50,979 --> 00:18:52,177
Uh-uh.

353
00:18:52,179 --> 00:18:57,016
- Hmm. She seems sort of tense.
- Can be.

354
00:18:57,018 --> 00:19:01,353
Good body. Good boobs.
Huge features.

355
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:03,121
Eyes like Bambi.

356
00:19:03,123 --> 00:19:06,024
Yeah. She can take
quite a lot.

357
00:19:06,026 --> 00:19:08,794
Maybe we could give her...
Maybe...

358
00:19:08,796 --> 00:19:12,365
Maybe we could give her this.

359
00:19:12,367 --> 00:19:15,768
God, no. Not chic.
We can do better than that.

360
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:18,405
It's called the Toussaint.

361
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:19,772
Named for Jeanne Toussaint,

362
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:22,641
Cartier's director of jewelry
from '33 to '68.

363
00:19:22,643 --> 00:19:25,177
It's over six pounds
of diamonds.

364
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:26,311
Right.

365
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,380
After she died, they sold it
back to Cartier,

366
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:31,051
and they've kept it
in their vault ever since.

367
00:19:31,053 --> 00:19:32,851
- They've never let it out.
- Mmm-hmm.

368
00:19:32,853 --> 00:19:35,254
So then, how are we
gonna get it out?

369
00:19:35,256 --> 00:19:38,660
Well, they might
let it out for her.

370
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,162
The theme of this year's ball

371
00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:44,630
is European royalty...

372
00:19:44,632 --> 00:19:47,734
...of which the crown jewels
are a featured element.

373
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:52,004
So, if you were to insist
on the Toussaint

374
00:19:52,006 --> 00:19:55,209
on behalf of Daphne Kluger...

375
00:20:04,052 --> 00:20:05,717
Must be worth
quite a lot.

376
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:07,020
Yeah.

377
00:20:07,022 --> 00:20:09,021
- These are all Russians.
- They're hackers.

378
00:20:09,023 --> 00:20:10,522
Are there no hackers
who aren't Russian?

379
00:20:10,524 --> 00:20:13,192
No, there's barely any
Russians who aren't hackers.

380
00:20:13,194 --> 00:20:16,398
- Just keep looking, please.
- Sure.

381
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:46,893
Okay.

382
00:21:01,575 --> 00:21:04,510
Sorry about Danny.

383
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:07,082
Sorry about your pops.

384
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:10,983
So, what are you doing here?

385
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,419
I might have
something for you.

386
00:21:13,421 --> 00:21:14,521
A job.

387
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,688
You wanna run some stuff
through the store?

388
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,457
No, thank you.

389
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:19,961
A little more than that.

390
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,162
How long would it take you

391
00:21:23,164 --> 00:21:24,397
to make
seven pieces of jewelry,

392
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:26,765
if the stones
were already cut?

393
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:29,505
Probably five or six hours.

394
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:32,705
How long if I told you
you didn't have to

395
00:21:32,707 --> 00:21:34,008
live with your mother anymore?

396
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,512
Less.

397
00:21:40,447 --> 00:21:42,514
I'm never taking
the F-train again.

398
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,717
She's in.

399
00:21:45,719 --> 00:21:47,552
She is in where?

400
00:21:47,554 --> 00:21:50,022
This what you talking about?
Bunch of vases.

401
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,560
Yeah,
that's the Egyptian wing.

402
00:21:52,427 --> 00:21:53,693
She's in the Met?

403
00:21:53,695 --> 00:21:55,560
Security cameras.

404
00:21:55,562 --> 00:21:57,399
There's a lot of 'em.

405
00:21:57,998 --> 00:21:59,432
My name's Debbie.

406
00:21:59,434 --> 00:22:01,868
- Nine Ball.
- What's your real name?

407
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:02,935
Eight Ball.

408
00:22:02,937 --> 00:22:04,169
We use real names around here.

409
00:22:04,171 --> 00:22:06,140
Could I talk to you
for a minute?

410
00:22:08,275 --> 00:22:09,743
I asked you
to get me a hacker.

411
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,343
She is one of the best hackers
on the East Coast.

412
00:22:11,345 --> 00:22:12,878
- Oh, I'm honored...
- She has other clients.

413
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,179
They don't know
her real name either.

414
00:22:14,181 --> 00:22:15,747
I'm sorry, "other clients"?

415
00:22:15,749 --> 00:22:17,117
- Now?
- Yeah.

416
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:20,051
Did you tell her
what her cut was?

417
00:22:20,053 --> 00:22:22,190
- Of course.
- And?

418
00:22:28,796 --> 00:22:31,199
Look. She's smoking!

419
00:22:34,768 --> 00:22:36,936
So, Nine Ball.

420
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,705
Uh, do I call you
Nine Ball? Nine...

421
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:42,343
Or Baller.

422
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:45,413
Baller? Okay. Okay.

423
00:22:45,847 --> 00:22:47,512
Uh-oh.

424
00:22:47,514 --> 00:22:49,882
You know your footprint
is a disaster, right?

425
00:22:49,884 --> 00:22:53,052
- I'm sorry, what?
- Your footprint.

426
00:22:53,054 --> 00:22:55,387
- My footprint?
- Yes, ma'am.

427
00:22:55,389 --> 00:22:56,857
If you're planning
to steal shit,

428
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,357
you definitely
got to clean this up,

429
00:22:58,359 --> 00:23:01,394
'cause right now, my
little sister could hack you.

430
00:23:01,396 --> 00:23:04,132
Oh, right.
'Cause we had this guy...

431
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:12,103
Gotcha.

432
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:14,375
We'll clean that up.

433
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:20,079
- Can I ask where we're going?
- You'll see in a minute.

434
00:23:20,081 --> 00:23:21,614
Right, we're going to meet

435
00:23:21,616 --> 00:23:22,848
- Doris Kluger...
- Daphne.

436
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,349
- Daphne.
- Someone even more famous.

437
00:23:24,351 --> 00:23:26,351
Someone who makes
Daphne Kluger jealous.

438
00:23:26,353 --> 00:23:28,090
- Jealous?
- Hmm.

439
00:23:29,557 --> 00:23:30,889
In a minute,
we're gonna stand up.

440
00:23:30,891 --> 00:23:32,157
She's gonna sit down.

441
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,893
You'll recognize her.
Just be cool.

442
00:23:33,895 --> 00:23:35,194
- Aloof.
- But kind.

443
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:37,364
- But not too kind.
- Yeah.

444
00:23:37,366 --> 00:23:38,397
You're sweating.

445
00:23:38,399 --> 00:23:40,265
- Yeah, look, I sweat.
- Don't.

446
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:41,501
On her left hand is a tattoo.

447
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,836
I want you to take it,
admire it,

448
00:23:43,838 --> 00:23:46,739
but make physical contact,
and that's when we'll get it.

449
00:23:46,741 --> 00:23:48,343
"It"? What's "it"?

450
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:56,518
Hi. Wow.

451
00:23:57,584 --> 00:23:59,018
Oh, I know you!

452
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,887
Yes, I know you. I've seen
you. I've seen you in things.

453
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:03,489
Yeah.

454
00:24:03,491 --> 00:24:04,991
- No, you're good.
- Oh, thank you.

455
00:24:04,993 --> 00:24:07,292
- You're really good. Yeah.
- Thank you.

456
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:08,793
Well, I just really wanted
to say, "Thank you."

457
00:24:08,795 --> 00:24:10,228
Thank you?

458
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:13,267
For helping us with
the feline rescue project.

459
00:24:17,339 --> 00:24:19,105
Penelope Stern?

460
00:24:19,107 --> 00:24:21,339
Is she even old enough
to go to the Met Ball?

461
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:22,609
Apparently.

462
00:24:22,611 --> 00:24:24,208
Who cares
who's dressing her anyway?

463
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:27,114
Uh, I think Page Six.

464
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:34,486
I never met with Rose Weil.
You said I met with everybody.

465
00:24:34,488 --> 00:24:37,356
- You said she was a relic.
- I meant iconic.

466
00:24:37,358 --> 00:24:39,626
Do you want me
to set up a meeting?

467
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:43,264
- Yes!
- Okay.

468
00:24:47,701 --> 00:24:49,735
<i>I watched
one of her films last night.</i>

469
00:24:49,737 --> 00:24:51,271
<i>She's actually really good.</i>

470
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,137
<i>Whatever you do,
don't fawn.</i>

471
00:24:53,139 --> 00:24:54,506
<i>Just ignore her.</i>

472
00:24:54,508 --> 00:24:56,009
<i>Indifference,
it's an aphrodisiac.</i>

473
00:24:56,011 --> 00:24:57,210
<i>Very little
eye contact.</i>

474
00:24:57,212 --> 00:24:58,677
- Rose.
- Oh.

475
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,847
- Daphne. Miss Kluger.
- Finally.

476
00:25:01,849 --> 00:25:05,851
So, thank you so much
for meeting me so last minute.

477
00:25:05,853 --> 00:25:09,357
I am such an admirer of yours.
I have so many of your pieces.

478
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:13,826
- Really?
- Yeah.

479
00:25:13,828 --> 00:25:17,029
So, this search...
It has not been easy.

480
00:25:17,031 --> 00:25:18,531
And everything we've seen,

481
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:20,800
- you know, it's been great.
- Mmm-hmm.

482
00:25:20,802 --> 00:25:23,435
But it's been tired

483
00:25:23,437 --> 00:25:25,337
and you seem different.

484
00:25:25,339 --> 00:25:28,610
You know, like
you're immune to judgment.

485
00:25:30,145 --> 00:25:34,282
Like you're above all that.

486
00:25:35,516 --> 00:25:36,517
I'm sorry, what?

487
00:25:40,854 --> 00:25:42,554
What is going on?

488
00:25:42,556 --> 00:25:43,522
Uh...

489
00:25:43,524 --> 00:25:45,357
Oh, sorry.

490
00:25:45,359 --> 00:25:47,560
Um, what were you saying?

491
00:25:47,562 --> 00:25:50,765
I'm trying to hire you
for the Met Ball.

492
00:25:52,501 --> 00:25:55,337
Great. Thank you. My honor.

493
00:25:56,036 --> 00:25:57,304
Flattered.

494
00:25:59,841 --> 00:26:01,372
Wait till you see.

495
00:26:01,374 --> 00:26:03,609
This girl has some of the best
hands I've ever seen.

496
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:05,544
Is this one sane?

497
00:26:05,546 --> 00:26:07,379
Hundred percent.

498
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:08,813
All right, here's how
we're playing.

499
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:10,148
Red is money, okay?

500
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:12,518
Really? Three-card Monte?

501
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,453
Follow the Queen,
live your dream.

502
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:16,822
But don't sleep. Don't sleep.

503
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:18,692
'Cause she might disappear,
you saw that?

504
00:26:19,761 --> 00:26:20,827
It's lit, right?

505
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,528
She came back, though.
She likes you.

506
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:25,598
All right, let's hit it.
And we're following the Queen.

507
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
And we're following the Queen.

508
00:26:28,402 --> 00:26:29,668
Is this our only choice?

509
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,603
The turnover
in pickpockets is huge.

510
00:26:31,605 --> 00:26:34,106
Where she at?
Where that bitch at?

511
00:26:34,108 --> 00:26:35,442
Where she at?

512
00:26:35,444 --> 00:26:36,445
That one.

513
00:26:38,146 --> 00:26:40,012
Wanna call a lifeline
on that one?

514
00:26:40,014 --> 00:26:42,849
No. That one.

515
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:46,151
All right. That one is mine.

516
00:26:46,153 --> 00:26:47,954
Come on,
there's no hard feelings.

517
00:26:47,956 --> 00:26:50,222
And you're a real one, you
know? You know what I mean?

518
00:26:50,224 --> 00:26:52,992
Yeah, come back any time.

519
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:55,727
- Not bad.
- Yeah. I thought so.

520
00:26:55,729 --> 00:27:00,299
Turkey and provolone, please.

521
00:27:00,301 --> 00:27:02,501
So, I'm lifting one necklace.

522
00:27:02,503 --> 00:27:03,735
It's a very nice necklace.

523
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:05,306
Uh, lettuce and tomato.

524
00:27:06,774 --> 00:27:10,111
- And this is legit, the money?
- Hundred percent.

525
00:27:11,411 --> 00:27:13,781
- Okay, I'm in.
- Great.

526
00:27:15,716 --> 00:27:18,219
Uh, can I get
my watch back, please?

527
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:26,828
Thank you. And hers as well.

528
00:27:27,628 --> 00:27:29,428
No, I...

529
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,533
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

530
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:35,534
<i>Who do we have,
who do we have?</i>

531
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:38,370
- What about Ivy?
- No, still in jail.

532
00:27:38,372 --> 00:27:40,071
- Really?
- What about him?

533
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:41,240
- Well, he's a him.
- So?

534
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,541
Don't want a him.

535
00:27:42,543 --> 00:27:43,442
Because it's a him
or because it's a "him"?

536
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:44,877
No, he's not a "him."

537
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:46,412
- I barely know the guy.
- What's wrong with a him?

538
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,847
A him gets noticed,
a her gets ignored,

539
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:49,982
and for once,
we wanna be ignored.

540
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:51,384
What about Tammy?

541
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,066
Hey, buddy,

542
00:28:07,068 --> 00:28:09,568
can you do me a favor?
Can you take that outside?

543
00:28:19,648 --> 00:28:21,647
Debbie, I am with my family.

544
00:28:21,649 --> 00:28:22,918
- I told you...
- <i>I'm outside.</i>

545
00:28:24,118 --> 00:28:26,085
- What?
- <i>I'm in your garage.</i>

546
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:31,493
- Deb?
- Hmm?

547
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:37,029
Deb, what are you doing here?
I thought you were in jail.

548
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,397
Mmm. I got out.

549
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:42,836
Look at all this.
Thought you retired?

550
00:28:43,737 --> 00:28:44,803
I did.

551
00:28:44,805 --> 00:28:47,473
Not as exciting
as hijacking trucks

552
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,609
that are smuggling dishwashers
from Canada, right?

553
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:51,377
Yeah, well,
I don't do that anymore.

554
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:52,677
But you were
so very good at it.

555
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:54,513
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

556
00:28:54,515 --> 00:28:56,648
So these are all
for personal use, right?

557
00:28:56,650 --> 00:29:00,320
- What do you want?
- Just wanna reconnect.

558
00:29:00,322 --> 00:29:02,253
- Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

559
00:29:02,255 --> 00:29:04,522
- Reconnect?
- Mmm-hmm.

560
00:29:04,524 --> 00:29:06,291
You're not bored out here,
are you, Tam-Tam?

561
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:09,294
No, I'm not bored
out here at all.

562
00:29:09,296 --> 00:29:10,963
- Good, good.
- No.

563
00:29:10,965 --> 00:29:15,634
- Why would you ask that?
- Because I need a fence.

564
00:29:15,636 --> 00:29:17,736
Well, I told you I don't do
that anymore. I'm out.

565
00:29:17,738 --> 00:29:20,505
- It's a big job.
- I don't care.

566
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:21,941
Do you want me to tell you
how big a job it is?

567
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:23,574
No. No, I really don't.

568
00:29:23,576 --> 00:29:25,744
I think I'm gonna tell you
how big the job is.

569
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,551
- Are you kidding?
- No.

570
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:34,787
- Mommy, when's dinner ready?
- Shit!

571
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:36,922
Uh, sweetheart,
I will be right there.

572
00:29:36,924 --> 00:29:39,191
I'm so sorry.
Mommy will be right there.

573
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,993
But I'm hungry!

574
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:44,565
I know, sweetheart, I promise,
I will be right there.

575
00:29:47,601 --> 00:29:50,604
- Thanks a lot.
- She sounds sweet.

576
00:29:53,707 --> 00:29:56,410
How do you explain all this
to your husband?

577
00:29:58,112 --> 00:29:59,581
eBay.

578
00:30:17,764 --> 00:30:20,768
Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.

579
00:30:29,977 --> 00:30:32,144
We would like
to present to you all

580
00:30:32,146 --> 00:30:33,879
with a hypothetical situation.

581
00:30:33,881 --> 00:30:37,816
- How hypothetical?
- Not very, unless we screw up.

582
00:30:37,818 --> 00:30:40,852
$16.5 million in each of
your bank accounts,

583
00:30:40,854 --> 00:30:42,454
five weeks from now.

584
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:46,259
In three and a half weeks,

585
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,993
the Met will be
hosting its annual ball,

586
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:50,495
celebrating
its new costume exhibit,

587
00:30:50,497 --> 00:30:52,097
and we are going to rob it.

588
00:30:52,099 --> 00:30:53,832
Not the ball itself,

589
00:30:53,834 --> 00:30:55,635
but a very important
set of diamonds

590
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:56,769
that will be
attending the ball.

591
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,538
On the neck of Daphne Kluger.

592
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,939
Who Rose will be dressing.

593
00:31:00,941 --> 00:31:03,708
- The Toussaint?
- Very good.

594
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,945
Once Daphne
is inadvertently onboard,

595
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,245
we can then get the necklace
out of the Cartier vault,

596
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:11,183
hack the Met security system,
thank you, Nine Ball,

597
00:31:11,185 --> 00:31:12,650
and infiltrate the Gala,

598
00:31:12,652 --> 00:31:14,686
considered to be
one of the most exclusive...

599
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,722
The most exclusive.

600
00:31:16,724 --> 00:31:20,960
The most exclusive
party invitation in America.

601
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,462
So go home,
get your affairs in order,

602
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,531
because tomorrow,
we begin pulling off

603
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:29,103
one of the biggest
jewelry heists in history.

604
00:31:37,745 --> 00:31:40,611
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the big city.

605
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:43,081
- How long?
- Uh, not too long, I promise.

606
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:44,986
I'll be back
before you know it.

607
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:47,587
What are you gonna do?

608
00:31:47,589 --> 00:31:51,055
I am going to help my friend
Debbie with her job.

609
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,691
What kind of job?

610
00:31:52,693 --> 00:31:54,827
- It's complicated.
- Can I come with you?

611
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:59,532
No, sweetie, this is Mommy's
very special work trip.

612
00:31:59,534 --> 00:32:01,766
It is my account,
it is my money,

613
00:32:01,768 --> 00:32:03,234
and the only reason
I can't access it

614
00:32:03,236 --> 00:32:05,103
is because I cannot remember
the make and model

615
00:32:05,105 --> 00:32:06,772
of my second cousin's
first car.

616
00:32:06,774 --> 00:32:08,840
So if you could just...

617
00:32:08,842 --> 00:32:10,641
I don't wanna
make a withdrawal,

618
00:32:10,643 --> 00:32:12,880
I would like
to make a deposit.

619
00:32:13,414 --> 00:32:15,380
Yes, I...

620
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:17,215
Hey, can I...

621
00:32:17,217 --> 00:32:21,753
Exactly, yes. Yes, I'll hold.
What's up?

622
00:32:21,755 --> 00:32:24,756
Oh, hey, I was wondering
if I can get a MetroCard,

623
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:28,092
'cause I'm skateboarding in
from Queens every day.

624
00:32:28,094 --> 00:32:30,529
Can I get a MetroCard?

625
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,231
I don't have a MetroCard.

626
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:33,497
You don't have a MetroCard?

627
00:32:33,499 --> 00:32:34,733
I don't have a MetroCard.

628
00:32:34,735 --> 00:32:36,400
What are you, a tourist?

629
00:32:38,773 --> 00:32:40,872
You're fascinating.

630
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:42,340
You're gonna just
throw me one dub

631
00:32:42,342 --> 00:32:43,742
for a MetroCard? That's it?

632
00:32:43,744 --> 00:32:46,145
How about this?
We steal $50 million,

633
00:32:46,147 --> 00:32:48,548
I'll buy everybody MetroCards.
How's that?

634
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,751
Okay.

635
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,552
- Is that your brother?
- Mmm-hmm.

636
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:55,955
- He's hot.
- Mmm.

637
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,522
You sure
he's dead or...

638
00:32:57,524 --> 00:32:58,759
No.

639
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:05,430
Yes, sweetie,
Mommy is in her new job now.

640
00:33:05,432 --> 00:33:06,497
Charlie,
will you do me a favor?

641
00:33:06,499 --> 00:33:08,166
Can you put that right there?

642
00:33:08,168 --> 00:33:10,068
What, sweetheart?

643
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,739
Um, uh, well...

644
00:33:12,607 --> 00:33:14,639
Mommy finds very special toys,

645
00:33:14,641 --> 00:33:17,975
and then she finds
new homes for them.

646
00:33:17,977 --> 00:33:21,879
Yes, exactly like your turtle.
That is exactly right.

647
00:33:21,881 --> 00:33:24,648
Thank you so
much, Charlie, thank you.

648
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,051
Sweetheart, I have to go.

649
00:33:26,053 --> 00:33:27,785
I just got a brand new
toy for Debbie,

650
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:29,454
and I can't wait
to play with it.

651
00:33:42,569 --> 00:33:44,770
Zirconium.

652
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:46,303
- I like it.
- Yeah, I bet you do.

653
00:33:46,305 --> 00:33:47,473
Unhand the man.

654
00:33:47,475 --> 00:33:49,641
Thank you very much.

655
00:33:49,643 --> 00:33:52,110
Here are your
very special glasses.

656
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:56,014
If Rose can pull this off,
and that is a very big "if",

657
00:33:56,016 --> 00:33:58,451
these glasses
will scan the real necklace

658
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:01,654
and send a digital print
back to us here.

659
00:34:01,656 --> 00:34:03,288
Once we have that,

660
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,624
this thing will print

661
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,693
a replica
of the necklace in zirconium.

662
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:37,656
- Where is it?
- These are not the Toussaint.

663
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,525
We thought you might
want to see these first.

664
00:34:40,527 --> 00:34:42,927
Right. What for?

665
00:34:42,929 --> 00:34:47,632
There are certain logistical
problems with that necklace.

666
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:49,567
We wouldn't even know
how to insure it.

667
00:34:51,371 --> 00:34:53,304
All right.

668
00:34:53,306 --> 00:34:54,706
"We were
very clear on the phone."

669
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:56,074
Yes. We were
very clear on the phone.

670
00:34:56,076 --> 00:34:58,244
We are only interested
in the Toussaint.

671
00:34:58,246 --> 00:34:59,679
Yeah.

672
00:34:59,681 --> 00:35:04,118
Well, then, that would have to
be a much longer discussion.

673
00:35:08,822 --> 00:35:13,125
That necklace is valued at
over $150 million.

674
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:15,661
Well, I'm not really
a numbers person.

675
00:35:15,663 --> 00:35:18,330
It would require
its own security team,

676
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:19,797
a new insurance policy.

677
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:21,967
I'm sure you'll work out
all those details.

678
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:24,402
Oh,
it's not that simple.

679
00:35:24,404 --> 00:35:27,040
I'm afraid the answer is no.

680
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:29,607
No?

681
00:35:29,609 --> 00:35:31,211
No.

682
00:35:35,949 --> 00:35:38,351
Look, can I be frank?

683
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:41,052
I have always loved Cartier.

684
00:35:41,054 --> 00:35:43,188
I think, historically,
this has been

685
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,790
the most significant
house in the world.

686
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,561
But there is whole generation
out there

687
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,298
who mispronounce your name.

688
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:53,264
French can be difficult.

689
00:36:14,321 --> 00:36:15,790
Oui.

690
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:17,148
Stop it. Stop,

691
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,350
- that doesn't help. Stop.
- Okay, all right. All right.

692
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:26,993
Mmm.

693
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,965
We're too far underground.
Can't get a signal.

694
00:37:33,033 --> 00:37:34,766
Very secure down here, huh?

695
00:37:34,768 --> 00:37:37,004
Five feet of solid concrete.

696
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,478
You said you wanted
to see it in the light.

697
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,614
You wanted to see
the necklace in the light.

698
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:49,817
Right!

699
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:53,183
This is light.

700
00:37:53,185 --> 00:37:56,487
No, no, no, she means real
light. Natural light, yes.

701
00:37:56,489 --> 00:38:00,224
The red carpet happens
while the sun is still out.

702
00:38:00,226 --> 00:38:01,259
Yes, no,

703
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:03,594
- I'm afraid that's vital.
- It's vital.

704
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:07,132
Mmm. No, I must have the sun.

705
00:38:07,134 --> 00:38:09,235
She must have the sun.

706
00:38:09,237 --> 00:38:11,837
- How is this light, Ms. Weil?
- Um...

707
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,976
Yes, I think,
yes, we have the sun.

708
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:17,310
Much better.

709
00:38:19,612 --> 00:38:20,881
Mmm.

710
00:38:24,784 --> 00:38:26,252
- There it is!
- All right.

711
00:38:26,254 --> 00:38:27,321
Hello, sexy.

712
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,841
Come on, come on.

713
00:38:49,975 --> 00:38:51,342
Ms. Weil. Is she okay?

714
00:38:51,344 --> 00:38:52,978
- She's fine.
- Hmm.

715
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,612
She needs to take it in.

716
00:38:54,614 --> 00:38:55,917
This is her process.

717
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,686
It looks really good.

718
00:39:00,688 --> 00:39:02,356
- It's so clear.
- Yeah.

719
00:39:02,755 --> 00:39:03,958
Come on.

720
00:39:10,464 --> 00:39:12,264
No, okay. You gotta...

721
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,398
No. Yep.

722
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,799
If you are done, Ms. Weil...

723
00:39:14,801 --> 00:39:16,837
...we'd like to...

724
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,971
...return this to the vault.

725
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,174
<i>Ms. Weil?</i>

726
00:39:21,241 --> 00:39:22,243
Ms. Weil.

727
00:39:25,179 --> 00:39:26,947
Yes!

728
00:39:28,216 --> 00:39:29,283
I'm done.

729
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:36,923
Sweet.

730
00:39:39,859 --> 00:39:41,228
Mmm-hmm.

731
00:39:44,031 --> 00:39:46,333
Oh, my God!

732
00:39:57,111 --> 00:39:59,244
- Well?
- I don't know.

733
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:01,279
Well, you don't know
because this is only a muslin.

734
00:40:01,281 --> 00:40:03,047
It's going to be pink,
for a start.

735
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:05,016
I know it's going to be pink,
but I don't know.

736
00:40:05,018 --> 00:40:06,451
Yeah, I feel like
it's the waist.

737
00:40:06,453 --> 00:40:07,686
I feel, like, it's just...
And then the bottom.

738
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:09,020
I don't know about the bottom.

739
00:40:09,022 --> 00:40:10,355
We can definitely
change the hem.

740
00:40:10,357 --> 00:40:11,757
- It's the necklace.
- Oh, no.

741
00:40:11,759 --> 00:40:12,824
- It's not the necklace.
- It is the necklace.

742
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:14,627
It's just messy.

743
00:40:14,629 --> 00:40:15,793
No, no, no, it's not messy.

744
00:40:15,795 --> 00:40:17,496
It's messy
'cause it's safety pins.

745
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,029
No, you must remember
the diamonds.

746
00:40:19,031 --> 00:40:20,498
It's gonna be diamonds.

747
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,168
I just feel like I look huge.

748
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,603
Hey, Daphne, come here.
Come here. Come here.

749
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:29,107
Listen, deep breath...
Deep breath.

750
00:40:30,777 --> 00:40:33,244
Listen, look.

751
00:40:33,246 --> 00:40:37,047
You've got one of the greatest
necks in the world.

752
00:40:37,049 --> 00:40:38,549
In fact, you've got
the only neck

753
00:40:38,551 --> 00:40:41,552
that could carry
this necklace off.

754
00:40:41,554 --> 00:40:45,456
With your neck,
this necklace...

755
00:40:45,458 --> 00:40:50,161
You are gonna walk
into that Met Gala,

756
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:52,432
and you are gonna
light up the sky.

757
00:40:58,371 --> 00:41:00,674
Thank you.

758
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,474
You're welcome.

759
00:41:03,476 --> 00:41:05,844
If you like him,
you go right,

760
00:41:05,846 --> 00:41:08,045
and if you don't...

761
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:09,313
- I go left.
- Yeah, you go left.

762
00:41:09,315 --> 00:41:10,715
- So...
- Okay, that sounds easy.

763
00:41:10,717 --> 00:41:12,416
- So do you like him?
- Ooh. I like him a lot.

764
00:41:12,418 --> 00:41:13,750
Okay, why?

765
00:41:13,752 --> 00:41:15,119
He looks kind.

766
00:41:15,121 --> 00:41:16,554
I'm gonna swipe right.

767
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:18,623
- Okay. All right.
- Oh, my God!

768
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:19,891
So does that mean...

769
00:41:19,893 --> 00:41:21,226
He liked you back!
He likes you, too!

770
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,393
What happens now?
What happens now?

771
00:41:22,395 --> 00:41:24,328
- So you can message him.
- Okay.

772
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,232
And you can say, maybe,
like, the eggplant emoji,

773
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:29,301
or maybe the girl
that does this.

774
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:21,286
Excuse me.

775
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,753
Can you help me
with something?

776
00:42:22,755 --> 00:42:23,822
I think I'm a little lost.

777
00:42:23,824 --> 00:42:25,056
Of course, ma'am.

778
00:42:25,058 --> 00:42:26,357
I feel like
I'm going in circles.

779
00:42:26,359 --> 00:42:27,993
I came from Egypt
back there,

780
00:42:27,995 --> 00:42:29,728
and I'm trying to get
to Oceana.

781
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,862
It's a little confusing.

782
00:42:30,864 --> 00:42:32,364
You can go down the stairs
to your right,

783
00:42:32,366 --> 00:42:33,431
or you can go back
where you came from,

784
00:42:33,433 --> 00:42:34,665
- right down there.
- Okay.

785
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:36,000
It might take
a little bit longer.

786
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:38,705
Excuse me, ma'am.

787
00:42:49,014 --> 00:42:52,085
Excuse me. Excuse me.

788
00:42:59,225 --> 00:43:01,125
<i>Here's
one for your morning commute.</i>

789
00:43:01,127 --> 00:43:03,194
<i>Last night,
political artist Banksy</i>

790
00:43:03,196 --> 00:43:04,429
<i>made a surprise contribution
to the Met.</i>

791
00:43:04,431 --> 00:43:05,697
<i>Our founding mothers</i>

792
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:07,266
<i>appeared at the Met
last night.</i>

793
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:08,567
<i>Traffic at 15
after the hour.</i>

794
00:43:08,569 --> 00:43:10,804
<i>Your news, all the time.</i>

795
00:43:12,205 --> 00:43:15,005
<i>This is a major
security breach.</i>

796
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:16,208
How is this even possible?

797
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,677
He did it at the Tate, too.

798
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,944
So you're saying

799
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:21,779
the system your company
designed for our museum

800
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:24,116
does nothing to prevent
someone like Banksy...

801
00:43:24,118 --> 00:43:25,583
Sir, we're a little
more focused

802
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:28,089
on keeping things in
than keeping things out.

803
00:43:37,897 --> 00:43:39,666
Hey! How about an "Excuse me"?

804
00:44:07,127 --> 00:44:08,427
Correct me
if I'm wrong.

805
00:44:08,429 --> 00:44:10,161
You and your company
are responsible

806
00:44:10,163 --> 00:44:12,264
for monitoring
and safeguarding...

807
00:44:12,266 --> 00:44:14,401
Hey, want me to get the trash?

808
00:44:14,935 --> 00:44:16,234
What? No.

809
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,003
You sure? 'Cause you got
a lot here, buddy.

810
00:44:19,005 --> 00:44:20,306
Fine. Just hurry it up.

811
00:44:23,542 --> 00:44:24,810
The museum's agreement

812
00:44:24,812 --> 00:44:26,511
with your father's company
is very...

813
00:44:26,513 --> 00:44:28,447
- Generous.
- Specific.

814
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:29,913
Have a nice night.

815
00:44:29,915 --> 00:44:32,484
The board expects
McCallister Security

816
00:44:32,486 --> 00:44:34,953
to live up to the letter
of that agreement.

817
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:36,955
<i>We'll do
a full audit of the system</i>

818
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:39,991
<i>and update any part of it
that needs to be changed.</i>

819
00:44:39,993 --> 00:44:41,426
<i>What does that mean?</i>

820
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,795
<i>- We'll go in and fix it.
- When?</i>

821
00:44:43,797 --> 00:44:44,962
<i>Immediately.</i>

822
00:44:44,964 --> 00:44:46,264
<i>So, now that
we've gotten them</i>

823
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,632
to make changes
to their system,

824
00:44:47,634 --> 00:44:50,168
we can make changes, too,
and not be detected.

825
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,569
Can you pull up the cameras?

826
00:44:51,571 --> 00:44:53,538
They've got every inch
of this place covered.

827
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,107
But here is not where
we're gonna hit it.

828
00:44:56,109 --> 00:44:58,710
We are gonna do it in a spot
they don't even care about.

829
00:44:58,712 --> 00:44:59,713
Nine Ball.

830
00:45:01,013 --> 00:45:02,547
Now it's a New York State law

831
00:45:02,549 --> 00:45:04,781
that no cameras can be mounted
in a public bathroom.

832
00:45:04,783 --> 00:45:07,217
Apparently,
it's a privacy violation.

833
00:45:07,219 --> 00:45:08,453
Unless you're into that.

834
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,786
And once we get
the Toussaint,

835
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:10,922
we are gonna have to
get it out of there

836
00:45:10,924 --> 00:45:11,855
without being detected,

837
00:45:11,857 --> 00:45:13,090
and they're gonna go over

838
00:45:13,092 --> 00:45:14,592
their security footage
with a fine-tooth comb,

839
00:45:14,594 --> 00:45:17,328
and anyone seen exiting
that bathroom

840
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,532
is gonna be a suspect.

841
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:20,197
So...

842
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:22,203
So we get a mule.

843
00:45:23,402 --> 00:45:25,605
Somebody else
is gonna move it for us.

844
00:45:26,906 --> 00:45:28,339
How much space
do you need outside

845
00:45:28,341 --> 00:45:29,821
that bathroom
to plant it on somebody?

846
00:45:30,810 --> 00:45:31,810
I don't know. Nine feet?

847
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,311
And how long
is it gonna take us

848
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:34,980
to build
a nine-foot blind spot?

849
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,514
- Moving a camera?
- Mmm-hmm.

850
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,786
Bit by bit, 10, 12 days.

851
00:45:40,987 --> 00:45:42,886
Great.

852
00:45:42,888 --> 00:45:45,123
How long did it take you
to figure all this out?

853
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:47,192
Mmm...

854
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:50,331
Five years, eight months,
and 12 days.

855
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,000
Give or take.

856
00:45:55,034 --> 00:45:56,301
Cartier has hired

857
00:45:56,303 --> 00:45:58,239
the best private security
in the world.

858
00:45:58,938 --> 00:46:00,272
Guillermo DeVita

859
00:46:00,274 --> 00:46:02,273
led the pope's security
for 10 years.

860
00:46:02,275 --> 00:46:04,409
And as you know,
they've never lost a pope.

861
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:06,811
- Mmm.
- Yuri Eshel, former Mossad

862
00:46:06,813 --> 00:46:10,480
and IDF Special Forces,
elite commando unit.

863
00:46:10,482 --> 00:46:12,750
I'm pretty sure
they're assassins.

864
00:46:12,752 --> 00:46:15,219
- Well, it's a nice necklace.
- Yeah.

865
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:18,422
So you can go ahead and just
add them to your list.

866
00:46:18,424 --> 00:46:20,257
- What list?
- That list.

867
00:46:20,259 --> 00:46:21,861
It's not a list.

868
00:46:43,183 --> 00:46:45,319
Okay. Who is he?

869
00:46:50,757 --> 00:46:52,493
Hey, boo.

870
00:47:03,937 --> 00:47:05,005
Oh, Paul.

871
00:47:54,453 --> 00:47:56,453
You poor thing.

872
00:48:01,493 --> 00:48:03,061
Look at that.

873
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:06,433
Oh!

874
00:48:11,672 --> 00:48:13,637
We don't even know
if it is Banksy.

875
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:15,007
It could be an imitator.

876
00:48:40,299 --> 00:48:41,502
That's all you got?

877
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,525
Sweet!

878
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:24,842
Good afternoon. <i>Vogue.</i>

879
00:49:24,844 --> 00:49:26,877
Thank you for coming in
so last minute.

880
00:49:26,879 --> 00:49:28,712
Oh, of course.
Thank you for having me.

881
00:49:28,714 --> 00:49:30,681
I guess you heard, we lost
one of our coordinators.

882
00:49:30,683 --> 00:49:32,317
Yes, and that sounded awful.

883
00:49:32,319 --> 00:49:33,384
Chiggers.

884
00:49:33,386 --> 00:49:34,918
I know.

885
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,154
- What are those anyway?
- It's like a mite, I think.

886
00:49:37,156 --> 00:49:39,757
It burrows into the skin
and lays its eggs inside.

887
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,958
And then they hatch
and they dig their way out.

888
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,197
Apparently, it can last
for weeks.

889
00:49:45,598 --> 00:49:47,898
Well, you certainly
seem qualified.

890
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,833
Thank you.

891
00:49:48,835 --> 00:49:50,168
Maybe overqualified.

892
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:52,369
Well, how can anyone
be overqualified?

893
00:49:52,371 --> 00:49:54,404
This is the Met Gala
after all.

894
00:49:54,406 --> 00:49:56,943
Gala. Met Gala.

895
00:49:58,545 --> 00:50:00,011
- It's Gala.
- Gala.

896
00:50:00,013 --> 00:50:01,078
Is it Gala?

897
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,114
- Yeah.
- Okay.

898
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:06,250
<i>Roger Federer again</i>

899
00:50:06,252 --> 00:50:09,487
<i>one game away
from another championship.</i>

900
00:50:09,489 --> 00:50:11,523
<i>The love for Federer in
this place is just incredible.</i>

901
00:50:11,525 --> 00:50:12,726
Anna.

902
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:14,824
Uh, yeah?

903
00:50:14,826 --> 00:50:16,728
You have that interview
for the Met staff position.

904
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,061
- Do it, do it.
- Okay.

905
00:50:18,063 --> 00:50:19,764
<i>You cannot be serious!</i>

906
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:21,199
<i>A backhand down-the-line win!</i>

907
00:50:21,201 --> 00:50:23,333
We're really short
on desk space,

908
00:50:23,335 --> 00:50:25,104
so you'll be down here.

909
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:32,109
This way.

910
00:50:32,111 --> 00:50:34,712
- Okay, so here is your desk.
- Thank you.

911
00:50:34,714 --> 00:50:35,846
And Christina
will get you started.

912
00:50:35,848 --> 00:50:37,215
Great. Thank you so much.

913
00:50:37,217 --> 00:50:38,348
- Have a good day!
- Thanks!

914
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:39,650
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

915
00:50:39,652 --> 00:50:40,985
Was that the bathroom
that we passed?

916
00:50:40,987 --> 00:50:42,453
Oh, yes, just down the hall.

917
00:50:42,455 --> 00:50:43,690
Thank you.

918
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:07,377
This is unbelievable.

919
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:08,545
That's Leo?

920
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:09,813
Leo-Leo?

921
00:51:09,815 --> 00:51:11,315
There's only one Leo.

922
00:51:11,317 --> 00:51:13,284
Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!

923
00:51:13,286 --> 00:51:14,819
You're so white!

924
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,221
Can't we just go to this?
Do we have to steal stuff?

925
00:51:17,223 --> 00:51:18,523
Yes!

926
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:20,558
- Where is she?
- Table four, 10:00.

927
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,759
Straightest shot
to the bathroom

928
00:51:21,761 --> 00:51:22,960
without putting her
in Siberia.

929
00:51:22,962 --> 00:51:24,596
There's a blank spot
next to her.

930
00:51:24,598 --> 00:51:25,933
It's for her date.

931
00:51:28,234 --> 00:51:29,534
Who's her date?

932
00:51:29,536 --> 00:51:30,737
I don't know.

933
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:34,538
- Hi.
- Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt,

934
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,505
but I've got
the final guest list

935
00:51:35,507 --> 00:51:36,574
for the Chairman's Dinner.

936
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:37,942
Oh, great.

937
00:51:37,944 --> 00:51:39,243
You have
all their arrival times?

938
00:51:39,245 --> 00:51:40,478
All their arrival times,

939
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:43,514
including a few additional
names at the bottom.

940
00:51:43,516 --> 00:51:44,915
Claude Becker?

941
00:51:44,917 --> 00:51:46,482
<i>His publicist
was into it.</i>

942
00:51:46,484 --> 00:51:47,987
<i>I barely had to ask.</i>

943
00:51:56,129 --> 00:51:57,460
Hello.

944
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:58,795
They put me next to you.

945
00:51:58,797 --> 00:52:00,398
Oh, lucky me.

946
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,602
Hello.

947
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:03,269
Claude Becker.

948
00:52:04,103 --> 00:52:05,304
Daphne Kluger.

949
00:52:16,882 --> 00:52:19,752
The ego has landed.

950
00:52:20,953 --> 00:52:22,822
<i>How did you ever fall
for this schmuck?</i>

951
00:52:23,822 --> 00:52:25,723
Seriously?

952
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,726
Lou and I were going through
a rough patch,

953
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,529
and I really wanted
a big score of my own.

954
00:52:32,531 --> 00:52:33,864
So he roped you in?

955
00:52:33,866 --> 00:52:36,102
Mmm. Not really.

956
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,404
What, told you the truth?

957
00:52:40,406 --> 00:52:42,274
Only way to con a con, right?

958
00:52:50,382 --> 00:52:51,750
<i>B1.</i>

959
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,116
<i>Lou and I were
rigging Bingo</i>

960
00:52:53,118 --> 00:52:55,752
<i>and running cheap cons
at Roulette.</i>

961
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:57,957
<i>Lucky if we made $1,000
a night.</i>

962
00:53:00,225 --> 00:53:02,259
- Bingo!
- Bingo call.

963
00:53:02,261 --> 00:53:04,429
<i>So a friend of mine
set me up with this art dealer</i>

964
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,397
<i>and we worked out
a simple little hustle.</i>

965
00:53:06,399 --> 00:53:08,165
- Claude Becker?
- Right through there.

966
00:53:08,167 --> 00:53:09,333
Thank you.

967
00:53:09,335 --> 00:53:11,802
Hi. I'm Debbie.

968
00:53:11,804 --> 00:53:13,072
- Claude Becker.
- Oh.

969
00:53:15,475 --> 00:53:17,974
<i>When somebody
got interested in a piece,</i>

970
00:53:17,976 --> 00:53:20,980
<i>I'd pose as another buyer
and drive up the price.</i>

971
00:53:22,681 --> 00:53:26,919
<i>Money was good and he was
great in the kitchen.</i>

972
00:53:27,853 --> 00:53:30,387
Oh, my God, it's so good.

973
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:31,688
One day

974
00:53:31,690 --> 00:53:34,727
he asked me to pose
as the seller, not the buyer.

975
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,427
What did you do?

976
00:53:36,429 --> 00:53:38,031
Well...

977
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,301
One signature,
half a million dollars.

978
00:53:48,908 --> 00:53:50,775
<i>He said it was simple.</i>

979
00:53:50,777 --> 00:53:53,610
<i>I'd hand them the documents,
and they'd slide me a check.</i>

980
00:53:53,612 --> 00:53:57,116
<i>The whole thing would take
a couple minutes, tops.</i>

981
00:54:06,426 --> 00:54:07,558
Sorry we're late.

982
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:09,092
- Not at all.
- It's okay.

983
00:54:09,094 --> 00:54:10,460
- Very nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

984
00:54:10,462 --> 00:54:12,342
- It's a beautiful piece.
- Oh, we just love it!

985
00:54:14,433 --> 00:54:17,435
<i>He was right.
It all happened very quickly.</i>

986
00:54:17,437 --> 00:54:18,902
You have a right
to an attorney.

987
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:20,570
If you cannot afford
an attorney...

988
00:54:20,572 --> 00:54:23,708
<i>It wasn't my painting.
She brought the picture to me.</i>

989
00:54:23,710 --> 00:54:25,775
She had documentation,
signatures.

990
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:27,344
And you two were dating?

991
00:54:27,346 --> 00:54:28,712
What?

992
00:54:28,714 --> 00:54:30,915
Not saying a word.

993
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:32,185
Are you sure?

994
00:54:33,853 --> 00:54:38,191
'Cause he's not being quite
as tight-lipped as you are.

995
00:54:41,092 --> 00:54:43,159
Are these your signatures?

996
00:54:43,161 --> 00:54:45,996
Yeah, I will testify.

997
00:54:45,998 --> 00:54:48,531
I was defrauded too, right?

998
00:54:48,533 --> 00:54:50,035
I'll be right outside.

999
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,101
Hey!

1000
00:55:22,368 --> 00:55:24,500
We need to talk.

1001
00:55:24,502 --> 00:55:26,703
You better tell me this is not
what I think this is.

1002
00:55:26,705 --> 00:55:28,806
What?

1003
00:55:28,808 --> 00:55:30,277
Claude Becker.

1004
00:55:30,877 --> 00:55:32,179
I didn't do that.

1005
00:55:33,078 --> 00:55:34,945
I'm not a croupier, okay?

1006
00:55:34,947 --> 00:55:36,647
Or a tourist with
a bucket of quarters.

1007
00:55:36,649 --> 00:55:38,014
Don't con me.

1008
00:55:38,016 --> 00:55:40,183
You do not run a job in a job!

1009
00:55:40,185 --> 00:55:42,920
It's not going to matter.

1010
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,422
We are going to get caught.

1011
00:55:44,424 --> 00:55:45,592
Stop it. We're not.

1012
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:50,862
Why do you do this?

1013
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:52,295
Why can't you just do a job?

1014
00:55:52,297 --> 00:55:54,200
Why does there always
have to be an asterisk?

1015
00:55:55,533 --> 00:55:57,235
You frame him, I walk.

1016
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:58,338
Stop.

1017
00:55:59,172 --> 00:56:00,904
This is just like last time.

1018
00:56:00,906 --> 00:56:02,241
Lou. Lou!

1019
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:04,641
Lou.

1020
00:56:04,643 --> 00:56:07,011
He sent me to jail!

1021
00:56:07,013 --> 00:56:09,348
You have no idea
what that's like.

1022
00:56:14,054 --> 00:56:17,721
Yeah, well,
he's gonna do it again.

1023
00:56:17,723 --> 00:56:19,426
No, he's not.

1024
00:56:20,826 --> 00:56:22,529
He's not.

1025
00:56:37,076 --> 00:56:39,512
Good. Switching cameras.

1026
00:56:44,417 --> 00:56:46,486
Walking towards the bathroom.

1027
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,426
Okay, in the blind spot.

1028
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:00,630
I'm gonna keep walking.

1029
00:57:00,632 --> 00:57:02,465
Nothin'.

1030
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:03,904
Nothin'.

1031
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,538
Okay, you're right there.

1032
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:17,947
<i>12 feet. Nice job!</i>

1033
00:57:17,949 --> 00:57:19,750
Thank you, Nine Ball.

1034
00:57:19,752 --> 00:57:22,587
That easy. Don't mention it.

1035
00:57:22,589 --> 00:57:23,623
What's hard?

1036
00:57:29,795 --> 00:57:31,328
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!

1037
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:32,797
Sorry, listen,
I know this really

1038
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:34,098
isn't any of my business...

1039
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,264
No, go ahead.

1040
00:57:35,266 --> 00:57:36,799
It's just
a little red flag here.

1041
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:39,136
But this caterer doesn't have
a nutritional specialist.

1042
00:57:39,138 --> 00:57:40,636
- Okay.
- And we're running

1043
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:41,772
at 20% special meals.

1044
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:44,808
Vegan, gluten-free,
low sodium, lactose.

1045
00:57:44,810 --> 00:57:46,844
I had a client get sued.

1046
00:57:46,846 --> 00:57:48,277
- Really?
- Yeah.

1047
00:57:48,279 --> 00:57:49,947
I don't think we should wing
any of this stuff.

1048
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,848
I think we are short
a staff person.

1049
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,183
We need a nutritionist.

1050
00:57:53,185 --> 00:57:54,851
<i>- I do know someone.
- You do?</i>

1051
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:56,119
<i>Yeah, and she's great.</i>

1052
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:57,690
<i>She just moved here
from Australia.</i>

1053
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:04,795
Yes.

1054
00:58:04,797 --> 00:58:06,330
<i>Okay. Go.</i>

1055
00:58:06,332 --> 00:58:07,665
Vendor, hallway, hallway.

1056
00:58:07,667 --> 00:58:08,632
Past the auditorium.

1057
00:58:08,634 --> 00:58:10,366
Hallway, hallway,
hallway, entry.

1058
00:58:10,368 --> 00:58:13,439
Hi, hi! I'm so sorry I'm late.
Traffic was horrible.

1059
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:18,009
Okay...

1060
00:58:18,011 --> 00:58:21,043
- Amita.
- Thank you.

1061
00:58:21,045 --> 00:58:22,582
Constance.

1062
00:58:23,681 --> 00:58:25,084
Nine Ball.

1063
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,187
And Lou.

1064
00:58:28,020 --> 00:58:30,087
And Rose.

1065
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:31,487
Thank you.

1066
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:33,993
- And Debbie.
- Thank you.

1067
00:58:36,962 --> 00:58:38,561
<i>Hi, I'm Daphne Kluger,</i>

1068
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:41,699
<i>and this is your sneak peek of
this year's Costume Institute.</i>

1069
00:58:41,701 --> 00:58:45,002
This is Dolce
and that's Galliano for Dior.

1070
00:58:45,004 --> 00:58:47,003
- And that is McQueen.
- Wow.

1071
00:58:47,005 --> 00:58:48,538
And who's
dressing you tomorrow?

1072
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:50,840
Mmm. Rose Weil.

1073
00:58:50,842 --> 00:58:52,275
- Interesting.
- I know.

1074
00:58:52,277 --> 00:58:53,978
I kind of thought
it was an unexpected choice.

1075
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:55,179
What's this over here?

1076
00:58:55,181 --> 00:58:56,681
So these are
the crown jewels

1077
00:58:56,683 --> 00:58:59,315
from eight royal families
of Europe.

1078
00:58:59,317 --> 00:59:00,817
Which is probably why
there's a moat.

1079
00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:03,286
- So we can't go over there?
- No. God, no.

1080
00:59:03,288 --> 00:59:05,056
I wish we could. Anyway...

1081
00:59:05,058 --> 00:59:07,590
Uh, they are on loan to us
from Dmitri

1082
00:59:07,592 --> 00:59:10,293
Very-Long-Russian-Last-Name
that I can't pronounce.

1083
00:59:10,295 --> 00:59:11,994
We hear those aren't
the only jewels

1084
00:59:11,996 --> 00:59:13,130
that'll be on display.

1085
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,864
- Who told you?
- I have sources.

1086
00:59:14,866 --> 00:59:18,168
Well, since the cat's
already out of the bag...

1087
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,170
Yes, I will be wearing
a necklace

1088
00:59:20,172 --> 00:59:22,306
that Cartier has decided
to loan me.

1089
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,639
It's called the Toussaint,

1090
00:59:23,641 --> 00:59:25,474
and it has been in a vault
for 50 years.

1091
00:59:25,476 --> 00:59:27,444
And I'm
just a little excited.

1092
00:59:27,446 --> 00:59:29,647
- Have you tried it on already?
- Maybe.

1093
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:32,418
- How many carats is it?
- Enough.

1094
01:00:12,056 --> 01:00:13,824
Hey.

1095
01:00:13,826 --> 01:00:15,125
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1096
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:17,393
- Lipstick. What do you think?
- Oh.

1097
01:00:17,395 --> 01:00:20,697
Pink. Um, yeah. Barbie.

1098
01:00:20,699 --> 01:00:21,701
In a good way.

1099
01:00:22,667 --> 01:00:23,769
Thank you.

1100
01:00:28,574 --> 01:00:32,174
- It's here.
- Right. Finally. Great.

1101
01:00:32,176 --> 01:00:33,610
All right.

1102
01:00:33,612 --> 01:00:36,448
- Oh, you haven't seen it.
- No.

1103
01:00:37,183 --> 01:00:39,185
- Hello.
- Hello.

1104
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:47,460
Ooh. That's a big box.

1105
01:00:48,226 --> 01:00:49,596
All right.

1106
01:00:59,103 --> 01:01:00,639
Holy crap!

1107
01:01:01,607 --> 01:01:02,706
Should we, uh...

1108
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,007
Let's try it on.
See if it fits.

1109
01:01:04,009 --> 01:01:05,141
Okay.

1110
01:01:05,143 --> 01:01:07,179
- Can I, uh...
- Sure.

1111
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:14,951
Wow. That's heavy.

1112
01:01:14,953 --> 01:01:16,119
Really heavy.

1113
01:01:16,121 --> 01:01:18,355
Come to mama.

1114
01:01:18,357 --> 01:01:20,924
All right.
It might be a little...

1115
01:01:20,926 --> 01:01:23,393
Just a tad cold. Right.

1116
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:24,663
Ooh!

1117
01:01:25,464 --> 01:01:28,065
- Oh.
- All right. Okay.

1118
01:01:28,067 --> 01:01:31,168
- Oh, wow.
- Let me see. Right.

1119
01:01:31,170 --> 01:01:32,770
That goes in.

1120
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,137
Look at you.

1121
01:01:34,139 --> 01:01:35,842
Yep. There.

1122
01:01:36,808 --> 01:01:38,611
- It fits.
- Oh.

1123
01:01:39,111 --> 01:01:40,379
All right.

1124
01:01:41,212 --> 01:01:42,614
It fits.

1125
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:44,681
Right, okay.

1126
01:01:44,683 --> 01:01:47,217
We can get it off,
and then we can try the frock.

1127
01:01:47,219 --> 01:01:49,355
- Okay.
- Um... Hang on.

1128
01:01:50,188 --> 01:01:51,455
Oh!

1129
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:53,958
Sorry, you cannot do it.
I have to do it.

1130
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,393
It requires a special magnet.

1131
01:01:55,395 --> 01:01:57,494
- What?
- Cool.

1132
01:01:57,496 --> 01:02:00,130
- Uh, special magnet?
- Yes.

1133
01:02:03,268 --> 01:02:06,002
- Oh.
- That's cool.

1134
01:02:06,004 --> 01:02:08,240
That's brilliant. Brilliant.

1135
01:02:08,806 --> 01:02:09,906
Amazing.

1136
01:02:09,908 --> 01:02:11,476
Um...

1137
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:16,514
Can I just see that again,
out of interest?

1138
01:02:16,516 --> 01:02:18,918
- Sure.
- Thanks.

1139
01:02:20,752 --> 01:02:21,821
That's amazing.

1140
01:02:23,089 --> 01:02:27,090
Great. Let me just see.
So how does it work?

1141
01:02:27,092 --> 01:02:28,426
Hilda Schneider,
fashion reporter, <i>Der Spiegel.</i>

1142
01:02:28,428 --> 01:02:29,627
No.

1143
01:02:29,629 --> 01:02:30,826
Hilda Schneider,
diplomatic attache?

1144
01:02:30,828 --> 01:02:31,728
No.

1145
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,029
- Lufthansa asset?
- Lufthansa.

1146
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:34,264
Problem.

1147
01:02:34,266 --> 01:02:36,835
- With?
- From Rose.

1148
01:02:38,036 --> 01:02:39,969
Oh, God.

1149
01:02:39,971 --> 01:02:41,270
Come on!

1150
01:02:41,272 --> 01:02:42,672
<i>Oh, my God,
that is amazing.</i>

1151
01:02:42,674 --> 01:02:44,107
<i>And you can only do it
with a magnet?</i>

1152
01:02:44,109 --> 01:02:46,076
<i>- Only the magnet.
- Let me just see...</i>

1153
01:02:46,078 --> 01:02:48,545
Stop. Play it again.

1154
01:02:48,547 --> 01:02:50,346
<i>Oh, my God,
that is amazing.</i>

1155
01:02:50,348 --> 01:02:51,815
<i>And you can only do it
with a magnet?</i>

1156
01:02:51,817 --> 01:02:54,020
<i>- Only the magnet.</i>
<i>- Zoom</i> in a little bit.

1157
01:03:07,699 --> 01:03:09,833
What, Leslie? I'm busy.

1158
01:03:09,835 --> 01:03:11,768
Leslie?

1159
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:14,036
Hey, sis, we're in a bit of
a jam right now,

1160
01:03:14,038 --> 01:03:15,341
and I need your help.

1161
01:03:18,076 --> 01:03:21,712
So it seems like they used
poly-magnets and a spring.

1162
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,746
It gives you attraction
and repulsion

1163
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:25,648
<i>in the same axis, you know?</i>

1164
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:28,485
- Not really.
- <i>Well, they're drawn together.</i>

1165
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:31,554
But don't touch,
until you rotate it,

1166
01:03:31,556 --> 01:03:33,324
and then they lock.

1167
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:35,926
It's real dope.
I'll go get you a positive

1168
01:03:35,928 --> 01:03:39,697
<i>and a negative pole in a loop.
That oughta work fine.</i>

1169
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:42,699
You're a little genius, sis.
Thank you.

1170
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:44,301
Really? She fixed it?

1171
01:03:44,303 --> 01:03:46,069
Really?
You just asked me that?

1172
01:03:57,116 --> 01:03:59,451
Okay, you guys. Sound check.

1173
01:04:00,520 --> 01:04:02,918
- Nine Ball.
- Check.

1174
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,353
- Debbie.
- Check.

1175
01:04:04,355 --> 01:04:06,355
- Constance.
- Yeah.

1176
01:04:06,357 --> 01:04:07,556
- Amita.
- Yep.

1177
01:04:07,558 --> 01:04:09,328
- Lou.
- Check.

1178
01:04:24,976 --> 01:04:29,179
That shit was hectic.
Got chased by a cop!

1179
01:04:29,181 --> 01:04:32,882
Okay, so this is my sister,
everyone, Veronica.

1180
01:04:32,884 --> 01:04:35,754
Check this out. Crazy.

1181
01:04:37,156 --> 01:04:40,156
Tight. All right. I owe you
one, you little shit.

1182
01:04:40,158 --> 01:04:41,857
Just get me a new ID.

1183
01:04:41,859 --> 01:04:43,493
Go home.

1184
01:04:43,495 --> 01:04:45,364
What do your parents do?

1185
01:04:48,199 --> 01:04:50,967
<i>Okay, we are up.
Is everybody on?</i>

1186
01:04:50,969 --> 01:04:52,569
<i>- Yes.
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

1187
01:04:52,571 --> 01:04:54,670
All right, ladies.
Half an hour.

1188
01:04:54,672 --> 01:04:56,808
Countdown starting now.

1189
01:04:58,076 --> 01:05:03,047
Okay. First.
No need to be nervous.

1190
01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:04,346
The food is better
on the inside

1191
01:05:04,348 --> 01:05:05,648
than most people think

1192
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:08,585
and even solitary
can be kind of peaceful.

1193
01:05:15,895 --> 01:05:19,732
I just wanna say, thank you.

1194
01:05:21,132 --> 01:05:24,969
The last three weeks
have been amazing for me,

1195
01:05:24,971 --> 01:05:27,806
and we've all worked very hard
for this moment.

1196
01:05:28,641 --> 01:05:30,607
So whatever happens tonight,

1197
01:05:30,609 --> 01:05:32,043
I want you to remember
one thing,

1198
01:05:32,877 --> 01:05:35,712
you are not doing this for me.

1199
01:05:35,714 --> 01:05:38,648
You are not doing this
for you.

1200
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:41,784
Somewhere out there is
an eight-year-old girl

1201
01:05:41,786 --> 01:05:44,857
lying in bed,
dreaming of being a criminal.

1202
01:05:47,491 --> 01:05:50,159
Let's do this for her.

1203
01:05:50,161 --> 01:05:52,661
Do not engage
in informal conversation

1204
01:05:52,663 --> 01:05:53,964
with the guests, please.

1205
01:05:53,966 --> 01:05:55,866
Do not have your cell phone
on you.

1206
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:57,266
Please make sure
your cell phone is turned in

1207
01:05:57,268 --> 01:05:59,302
to security prior to the start
of the event.

1208
01:05:59,304 --> 01:06:00,503
Very important.

1209
01:06:00,505 --> 01:06:02,373
Do not slouch,
cross your arms,

1210
01:06:02,375 --> 01:06:03,672
put your hands
in your pockets.

1211
01:06:03,674 --> 01:06:04,775
I know it's gonna be
a long night.

1212
01:06:04,777 --> 01:06:06,842
I know you're gonna get tired.

1213
01:06:22,493 --> 01:06:24,661
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

1214
01:06:24,663 --> 01:06:26,195
Edward, so good to see you.
Claude Becker.

1215
01:06:26,197 --> 01:06:28,598
- Pleasure.
- And, of course, Rose Weil.

1216
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:30,467
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

1217
01:06:30,469 --> 01:06:32,668
My dear,
is that the Toussaint?

1218
01:06:32,670 --> 01:06:34,436
I'd say
you look like a million bucks,

1219
01:06:34,438 --> 01:06:35,971
but it's more like
100 million.

1220
01:06:35,973 --> 01:06:38,942
Thank you, it's a 150 million
actually.

1221
01:06:38,944 --> 01:06:41,614
What inspired you
for tonight's look?

1222
01:06:44,348 --> 01:06:45,584
Her.

1223
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:06,002
Unreal. So what makes
this such a fun night?

1224
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:07,737
I mean, you never know
who you're gonna see.

1225
01:07:07,739 --> 01:07:10,340
It's stars
from all over the planet.

1226
01:07:10,342 --> 01:07:13,613
Meeting actors, people in
the fashion industry.

1227
01:07:14,879 --> 01:07:17,781
So coming up next,
we have Serena Williams.

1228
01:07:17,783 --> 01:07:20,317
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

1229
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,985
I'm good, thank you.

1230
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:23,520
So you've conquered the court,
you've conquered motherhood...

1231
01:07:23,522 --> 01:07:25,922
- I'm trying.
- I mean, you are succeeding.

1232
01:07:25,924 --> 01:07:28,791
Sorry, we're a little
backed up today. Your name?

1233
01:07:28,793 --> 01:07:31,627
Uh, Hilda Schneider.

1234
01:07:31,629 --> 01:07:33,529
Oh, here it is.
Have a good night.

1235
01:07:42,507 --> 01:07:44,143
Here, Heidi! Heidi!

1236
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:16,909
Yes. Ready for tonight?

1237
01:08:26,484 --> 01:08:29,255
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to see you! Fantastic.

1238
01:08:49,241 --> 01:08:50,242
Ready to sit.

1239
01:08:56,480 --> 01:08:58,050
- Hot sauce?
- Hot sauce.

1240
01:09:28,113 --> 01:09:30,750
- You good?
- Yeah. I'll see you soon?

1241
01:09:33,284 --> 01:09:35,755
Hey, no, we're closed.

1242
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,722
We're closed.

1243
01:09:38,724 --> 01:09:41,193
Come on, dude.
It's right there.

1244
01:09:48,966 --> 01:09:50,803
Yeah, I got her.

1245
01:09:51,370 --> 01:09:53,171
Yeah, I see her.

1246
01:09:54,439 --> 01:09:56,174
We're a go.

1247
01:09:59,243 --> 01:10:00,777
Hi, everybody.

1248
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,312
- Hi.
- How are you?

1249
01:10:02,314 --> 01:10:03,914
Hi. Good to see you.

1250
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:06,115
It's so good to see you.
You look amazing.

1251
01:10:06,117 --> 01:10:08,420
- You too. Cheers.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

1252
01:10:12,757 --> 01:10:15,758
No, no, these are real.

1253
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,729
Thank you very much.
So kind of you.

1254
01:10:26,371 --> 01:10:28,340
Okay, counting down.

1255
01:10:28,873 --> 01:10:32,877
Three, two, one.

1256
01:10:33,845 --> 01:10:35,011
Need a gluten-free

1257
01:10:35,013 --> 01:10:36,373
and a broiled fish
for Table Eight.

1258
01:10:38,315 --> 01:10:39,883
Where's the vegan
for Table Four?

1259
01:10:39,885 --> 01:10:41,721
Over here.

1260
01:10:48,226 --> 01:10:49,461
Go, go, go.

1261
01:11:05,277 --> 01:11:06,877
Oh, God!

1262
01:11:12,783 --> 01:11:14,383
Mmm.

1263
01:11:14,385 --> 01:11:16,287
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1264
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:18,757
I'm so hungry.

1265
01:11:19,992 --> 01:11:23,660
Mmm. I haven't eaten anything
in three days.

1266
01:11:23,662 --> 01:11:24,897
I'm sorry.

1267
01:11:25,497 --> 01:11:26,797
Mmm.

1268
01:11:26,799 --> 01:11:28,367
Am I being rude?

1269
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,035
She's in deep.

1270
01:11:32,037 --> 01:11:33,806
Maybe half a bowl.

1271
01:11:51,590 --> 01:11:53,423
So,
you're supposed to curtsy.

1272
01:11:53,425 --> 01:11:56,526
They actually have a guy there
to teach you how to curtsy.

1273
01:11:56,528 --> 01:11:57,995
Yes, that's true.

1274
01:11:57,997 --> 01:12:00,963
Anyway, I go in, I'm doing
this little knee bend.

1275
01:12:00,965 --> 01:12:02,833
And the Queen glares at me

1276
01:12:02,835 --> 01:12:04,500
and says,
"That's not a curtsy."

1277
01:12:04,502 --> 01:12:05,468
Really?

1278
01:12:05,470 --> 01:12:07,536
So now,
I am in a curtsy standoff

1279
01:12:07,538 --> 01:12:08,838
with the Queen of England.

1280
01:12:08,840 --> 01:12:11,042
And...

1281
01:12:13,312 --> 01:12:14,477
Are you okay?

1282
01:12:14,479 --> 01:12:17,047
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

1283
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:18,447
Do you need to go
to the bathroom?

1284
01:12:18,449 --> 01:12:20,017
- No! I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

1285
01:12:20,019 --> 01:12:21,619
I'm at this curtsy standoff
with Queen...

1286
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:26,155
- And she's...
- Are you okay?

1287
01:12:26,157 --> 01:12:27,723
I'm fine. Just give me
one second,

1288
01:12:27,725 --> 01:12:29,926
hold on.
I just need to get this...

1289
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:31,330
You all right?

1290
01:12:46,611 --> 01:12:48,247
Game on!

1291
01:13:01,726 --> 01:13:03,926
Excuse me, we need to...

1292
01:13:11,737 --> 01:13:13,236
That's good.

1293
01:13:13,238 --> 01:13:15,941
Okay, you're right on
the edge of the blind spot.

1294
01:13:20,578 --> 01:13:22,812
Hey, you all right?

1295
01:13:22,814 --> 01:13:25,481
You good? Oh, you poor thing.

1296
01:13:25,483 --> 01:13:28,884
It's okay. You'll be okay.
Breathe, breathe...

1297
01:13:28,886 --> 01:13:31,254
Breathe... Breathe...

1298
01:13:31,256 --> 01:13:32,554
Breathe.

1299
01:13:35,726 --> 01:13:37,093
Okay, ten seconds.

1300
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:38,496
Here we go.

1301
01:13:39,797 --> 01:13:41,865
Hey, come here.

1302
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:43,098
This can't be here.
You need to

1303
01:13:43,100 --> 01:13:44,366
get this into the kitchen
right away.

1304
01:13:44,368 --> 01:13:46,703
- No problem.
- Okay, go. Go, go.

1305
01:13:46,705 --> 01:13:47,904
Coming at you, Deb.

1306
01:13:47,906 --> 01:13:49,675
Okay, here he comes.

1307
01:13:54,845 --> 01:13:56,080
Oh.

1308
01:14:03,388 --> 01:14:05,120
Okay, my mule is out.

1309
01:14:05,122 --> 01:14:07,358
All my ladies
still in the dark.

1310
01:14:10,295 --> 01:14:13,496
- Dude. Dude.
- Yo.

1311
01:14:13,498 --> 01:14:15,466
- You have it?
- Have what?

1312
01:14:16,167 --> 01:14:17,834
Oh, I smoked it.

1313
01:14:17,836 --> 01:14:19,067
What do you mean, "smoked it"?

1314
01:14:19,069 --> 01:14:20,303
You know, Josh asked,

1315
01:14:20,305 --> 01:14:22,038
and he was like,
"Hey, do you have..."

1316
01:14:22,040 --> 01:14:24,042
Guys, where is he?
What's wrong?

1317
01:14:24,708 --> 01:14:26,008
What's happening?

1318
01:14:26,010 --> 01:14:28,777
Stalled in the hallway.
Chitchattin'.

1319
01:14:28,779 --> 01:14:30,539
<i>Tammy, you got to
get him moving now.</i>

1320
01:14:37,421 --> 01:14:39,388
I'm putting the soup down,
I'm like...

1321
01:14:39,390 --> 01:14:41,825
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

1322
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:43,125
You're not getting paid
to talk.

1323
01:14:43,127 --> 01:14:45,197
- Let's go, come on.
- Yeah, sorry.

1324
01:14:58,242 --> 01:15:00,178
Here, I'll take those.
I'll take those.

1325
01:15:03,448 --> 01:15:04,616
Thanks.

1326
01:15:17,595 --> 01:15:20,198
Bathroom break.
Bathroom break!

1327
01:15:58,636 --> 01:16:00,272
That was intense.

1328
01:16:03,141 --> 01:16:04,675
What?

1329
01:16:17,756 --> 01:16:19,621
I don't know. It could've
fallen off in there.

1330
01:16:19,623 --> 01:16:21,089
It could've fallen off
back there. I'm not sure.

1331
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:22,657
I was just barfing
my guts out.

1332
01:16:22,659 --> 01:16:25,363
I was back at the table
the whole time.

1333
01:16:26,064 --> 01:16:27,196
Seal the exits.

1334
01:16:27,198 --> 01:16:28,464
What? No.
Do we have to make

1335
01:16:28,466 --> 01:16:29,833
such a big deal about this?
Come on.

1336
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:32,669
- You better lock it up.
- Oh, come on!

1337
01:16:32,671 --> 01:16:34,838
- We need to clear the room.
- You can't do that.

1338
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:36,673
We need to do a full sweep.

1339
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:38,173
We can't.

1340
01:16:38,175 --> 01:16:39,875
Do you know who's here?

1341
01:16:39,877 --> 01:16:41,944
You just lost $150 million.

1342
01:16:41,946 --> 01:16:44,847
What would you do if it was
a Rembrandt missing, hmm?

1343
01:16:44,849 --> 01:16:47,450
Dinner will resume shortly,
I promise!

1344
01:16:47,452 --> 01:16:49,252
Thank you so much
for your understanding.

1345
01:16:49,254 --> 01:16:51,156
Just walk towards the stairs.

1346
01:16:54,158 --> 01:16:55,991
Sealin' the exits.

1347
01:16:59,163 --> 01:17:01,263
Gentlemen, we're working
in teams of two.

1348
01:17:01,265 --> 01:17:03,365
We start at the perimeter
and work our way in.

1349
01:17:03,367 --> 01:17:04,666
Once you've been scanned,

1350
01:17:04,668 --> 01:17:06,937
please go directly
to the exit.

1351
01:17:06,939 --> 01:17:08,103
There will be someone there

1352
01:17:08,105 --> 01:17:09,305
that will show you
where to go.

1353
01:17:18,817 --> 01:17:20,415
Do you know
what's going on here?

1354
01:17:20,417 --> 01:17:21,517
An item
seems to have been lost.

1355
01:17:21,519 --> 01:17:22,819
They're looking for it now.

1356
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:24,823
- Do you know what they lost?
- Diamonds.

1357
01:17:25,390 --> 01:17:26,856
Lots of diamonds.

1358
01:17:26,858 --> 01:17:28,525
Diamonds? Really? We're
waiting around for diamonds?

1359
01:17:28,527 --> 01:17:30,629
Sir, I really just need to go
to the bathroom.

1360
01:17:34,099 --> 01:17:36,298
Okay, shit's blowing up.

1361
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,935
Police coming, Cartier coming.

1362
01:17:38,937 --> 01:17:40,605
A bunch of news people coming.

1363
01:17:41,506 --> 01:17:42,806
Yeah.

1364
01:17:42,808 --> 01:17:44,907
Yeah, they're doing it.

1365
01:17:44,909 --> 01:17:46,508
They're about halfway through.

1366
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:48,544
Was there anything you
did or anyone you talked to

1367
01:17:48,546 --> 01:17:50,213
between your table
and the bathroom?

1368
01:17:50,215 --> 01:17:52,114
I was rather preoccupied
at the time,

1369
01:17:52,116 --> 01:17:53,719
in case you didn't notice.

1370
01:18:02,461 --> 01:18:04,628
Amita, there's a guy
in the kitchen.

1371
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:06,495
<i>Just give it
a few more minutes.</i>

1372
01:18:06,497 --> 01:18:08,533
We don't have a few minutes.

1373
01:18:11,702 --> 01:18:12,737
Oh, shit!

1374
01:18:15,806 --> 01:18:17,339
<i>He's right there.</i>

1375
01:18:17,341 --> 01:18:18,540
<i>Tammy, how close?
Where are you now?</i>

1376
01:18:18,542 --> 01:18:19,745
By the moat.

1377
01:18:21,412 --> 01:18:23,447
Tammy, pull it
out of the water.

1378
01:18:26,550 --> 01:18:28,750
Just plant it in the water!
Just pull it out, right now!

1379
01:18:30,956 --> 01:18:32,257
Found it!

1380
01:18:33,558 --> 01:18:35,490
It was in the water.
It must have fallen off

1381
01:18:35,492 --> 01:18:36,860
while you were running.

1382
01:18:36,862 --> 01:18:38,060
May I?

1383
01:18:38,062 --> 01:18:39,527
We got it back.

1384
01:18:39,529 --> 01:18:41,599
Okay. I'll come back down.

1385
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:52,643
Constance, you good.

1386
01:19:04,989 --> 01:19:06,722
Whoa, sick!

1387
01:19:06,724 --> 01:19:08,793
Uh-uh.
There's glue, there's glue!

1388
01:19:23,942 --> 01:19:25,342
Feeling better?

1389
01:19:25,344 --> 01:19:26,678
I do now.

1390
01:20:02,145 --> 01:20:03,715
Couple scotches, please.

1391
01:22:26,123 --> 01:22:27,792
Dear God!

1392
01:22:37,068 --> 01:22:38,937
Thank you. Oh.

1393
01:22:40,604 --> 01:22:42,006
Very nice.

1394
01:22:44,074 --> 01:22:45,074
<i>First of all,</i>

1395
01:22:45,076 --> 01:22:46,674
I'm not a member
of law enforcement.

1396
01:22:46,676 --> 01:22:48,209
I work with
the insurance carrier.

1397
01:22:48,211 --> 01:22:50,045
Which means
I'm either looking for fraud

1398
01:22:50,047 --> 01:22:51,813
or I'm looking
for the real necklace.

1399
01:22:51,815 --> 01:22:53,848
Beyond that,
I couldn't care less.

1400
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:56,518
I'm afraid you won't find
either here.

1401
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,956
We'll see about that,
Monsieur...

1402
01:23:00,056 --> 01:23:02,760
- Monsieur?
- Delarue-Broussard.

1403
01:23:03,260 --> 01:23:04,392
Okay.

1404
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:05,861
Lawrence,
when did you last see

1405
01:23:05,863 --> 01:23:08,396
what you believe
to be the authentic item?

1406
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:10,066
When it left here
for the Met Gala.

1407
01:23:10,068 --> 01:23:11,801
When did you know
this was a fake?

1408
01:23:11,803 --> 01:23:13,503
The moment it was returned.

1409
01:23:13,505 --> 01:23:15,036
And you two.

1410
01:23:15,038 --> 01:23:16,539
You had your eyes
on the necklace

1411
01:23:16,541 --> 01:23:18,007
the entire evening?

1412
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:19,676
Apart from when
Miss Kluger had her

1413
01:23:19,678 --> 01:23:21,343
unfortunate incident
in the public toilet.

1414
01:23:21,345 --> 01:23:22,511
That's correct.

1415
01:23:22,513 --> 01:23:24,413
Did you accompany her inside?

1416
01:23:24,415 --> 01:23:25,780
It's a women's bathroom.

1417
01:23:25,782 --> 01:23:27,083
It's a very big necklace.

1418
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:28,817
There is only one entrance
in and out.

1419
01:23:28,819 --> 01:23:31,221
We were stationed at the door.

1420
01:23:31,223 --> 01:23:33,155
Did you check the plumbing?

1421
01:23:33,157 --> 01:23:35,124
- No.
- I did.

1422
01:23:35,126 --> 01:23:36,595
Okay, keep going forward.

1423
01:23:40,631 --> 01:23:43,734
Squeaky clean, so to speak.

1424
01:23:46,738 --> 01:23:48,773
Whoever stole this necklace

1425
01:23:50,675 --> 01:23:53,808
managed to get out
without being detected.

1426
01:23:53,810 --> 01:23:56,277
Which means we're looking
for someone very smart.

1427
01:23:56,279 --> 01:23:57,745
Gentlemen.

1428
01:23:57,747 --> 01:23:59,581
I've seen
a thoroughbred racehorse

1429
01:23:59,583 --> 01:24:01,784
thrown into a tree shredder.

1430
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,218
People will go
to great lengths

1431
01:24:03,220 --> 01:24:05,523
to defraud
an insurance carrier.

1432
01:24:08,626 --> 01:24:09,924
There! What's this?

1433
01:24:09,926 --> 01:24:11,794
I'm saying
that's not a blind spot.

1434
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:14,597
- What do you call that then?
- The bathroom.

1435
01:24:14,599 --> 01:24:15,932
I don't see a bathroom.

1436
01:24:15,934 --> 01:24:16,898
That's...

1437
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:18,400
Because it's
in the blind spot.

1438
01:24:18,402 --> 01:24:20,869
What can someone steal
from a bathroom anyway?

1439
01:24:20,871 --> 01:24:22,871
I don't know, toiletries,

1440
01:24:22,873 --> 01:24:24,874
mints, hand towels,

1441
01:24:24,876 --> 01:24:28,177
a six-pound diamond necklace,
apparently.

1442
01:24:28,179 --> 01:24:29,279
Now, who's this?

1443
01:24:29,281 --> 01:24:30,413
A busboy?

1444
01:24:30,415 --> 01:24:31,547
Do you know him?

1445
01:24:31,549 --> 01:24:32,917
How would I know a busboy?

1446
01:24:33,684 --> 01:24:35,383
Aren't we posh?

1447
01:24:35,385 --> 01:24:37,986
I don't know everyone who goes
in and out of the museum.

1448
01:24:37,988 --> 01:24:39,621
Why do you care
about a busboy?

1449
01:24:39,623 --> 01:24:41,589
He's the only person who moves
in and out of the blind spot

1450
01:24:41,591 --> 01:24:42,959
during the period in question.

1451
01:24:42,961 --> 01:24:45,030
Could you please
stop calling it a blind spot?

1452
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:46,928
Fine.

1453
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:50,031
The bathroom door
that we can't see

1454
01:24:50,033 --> 01:24:52,500
because of your unique
camera placement.

1455
01:24:52,502 --> 01:24:56,304
This is the most sophisticated
museum security in the world.

1456
01:24:56,306 --> 01:24:58,807
Every piece of art is recorded
from multiple angles.

1457
01:24:58,809 --> 01:25:02,477
We just don't happen to
keep art in the bathroom.

1458
01:25:02,479 --> 01:25:04,612
I'm not a critic, Kyle.

1459
01:25:04,614 --> 01:25:06,781
I'm an insurance investigator.

1460
01:25:06,783 --> 01:25:08,183
I didn't wanna do it.

1461
01:25:08,185 --> 01:25:10,119
But Eric's all, like,
"Come on!"

1462
01:25:10,121 --> 01:25:12,187
I'm, like, "Dude, I don't
do that anymore."

1463
01:25:12,189 --> 01:25:14,723
He's, like, "Everyone's out
on the loading dock!"

1464
01:25:14,725 --> 01:25:16,791
I know it was really stupid.

1465
01:25:16,793 --> 01:25:19,428
I know I'm an asshole,

1466
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:20,898
but it wasn't even my weed.

1467
01:25:23,268 --> 01:25:24,267
I'm sorry, what?

1468
01:25:24,269 --> 01:25:25,901
It wasn't my weed!
Do you want me

1469
01:25:25,903 --> 01:25:27,570
to pee in a cup or something?

1470
01:25:27,572 --> 01:25:28,904
No, that won't be necessary.

1471
01:25:28,906 --> 01:25:30,172
Are you sure?
I really don't mind.

1472
01:25:30,174 --> 01:25:31,039
I'm positive.

1473
01:25:31,041 --> 01:25:32,775
They put the necklace on me.

1474
01:25:32,777 --> 01:25:34,810
Then I walked the red carpet.

1475
01:25:34,812 --> 01:25:36,512
Then I saw the exhibit.

1476
01:25:36,514 --> 01:25:38,446
Then I ate my soup.

1477
01:25:38,448 --> 01:25:39,816
Then I hurled my guts out.

1478
01:25:39,818 --> 01:25:41,049
Then the necklace was gone.

1479
01:25:41,051 --> 01:25:42,851
And then
everybody freaked out.

1480
01:25:42,853 --> 01:25:45,954
And then they found it again,
I thought.

1481
01:25:45,956 --> 01:25:47,755
But, no?

1482
01:25:47,757 --> 01:25:49,691
This gentleman.

1483
01:25:49,693 --> 01:25:52,261
- Claude Becker.
- Mmm-hmm.

1484
01:25:52,263 --> 01:25:54,763
He was my date.

1485
01:25:54,765 --> 01:25:57,032
Was there ever a time
you two were alone

1486
01:25:57,034 --> 01:25:59,004
while you were wearing
the necklace?

1487
01:26:04,574 --> 01:26:06,776
No.

1488
01:26:06,778 --> 01:26:08,747
Anyone present with you
in the bathroom?

1489
01:26:09,613 --> 01:26:12,147
My head was in a toilet bowl.

1490
01:26:12,149 --> 01:26:13,415
How 'bout after?

1491
01:26:13,417 --> 01:26:15,418
A lot of people.

1492
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,022
Do you know this woman?

1493
01:26:20,023 --> 01:26:20,990
No.

1494
01:26:20,992 --> 01:26:22,423
Debbie Ocean,
convicted felon.

1495
01:26:22,425 --> 01:26:23,791
Her brother, Danny Ocean,

1496
01:26:23,793 --> 01:26:25,194
more convicted felon.

1497
01:26:25,196 --> 01:26:27,929
She was present on
the night of the incident.

1498
01:26:27,931 --> 01:26:29,431
Did she steal the necklace?

1499
01:26:29,433 --> 01:26:31,834
Apparently not, she's
the only one with an alibi.

1500
01:26:31,836 --> 01:26:34,335
Smiling at the camera
the entire time.

1501
01:26:34,337 --> 01:26:36,304
Ooh. So...

1502
01:26:36,306 --> 01:26:39,776
So I have five innocent people
who seem to be suspects,

1503
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,280
and someone who should be
a suspect but isn't.

1504
01:26:42,947 --> 01:26:44,746
I have cameras

1505
01:26:44,748 --> 01:26:47,016
covering every inch
of the museum,

1506
01:26:47,018 --> 01:26:49,118
except for the loo,

1507
01:26:49,120 --> 01:26:54,222
where $150 million was stolen
from that neck, your neck.

1508
01:26:54,224 --> 01:26:56,724
- Interesting case.
- Mmm.

1509
01:26:56,726 --> 01:26:58,393
Some days, I love my job.

1510
01:26:58,395 --> 01:27:01,297
I love my job, too.

1511
01:27:26,489 --> 01:27:28,225
You guys are fucked.

1512
01:27:29,260 --> 01:27:30,993
Nice place.

1513
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:32,194
It must be a bitch to heat.

1514
01:27:32,196 --> 01:27:33,995
Excuse me!
You are trespassing.

1515
01:27:33,997 --> 01:27:36,097
No. We asked her to come.

1516
01:27:36,099 --> 01:27:37,768
You asked her to come?

1517
01:27:39,103 --> 01:27:40,334
Oh.

1518
01:27:40,336 --> 01:27:42,271
We realized a few days ago
that Miss Kluger...

1519
01:27:42,273 --> 01:27:44,205
Was not
a total fricking idiot.

1520
01:27:44,207 --> 01:27:47,178
Might have gotten a sense
of what we were doing.

1521
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:54,682
You've got one of the greatest
necks in the world.

1522
01:27:54,684 --> 01:27:56,017
<i>First of all,
if there's one thing I know,</i>

1523
01:27:56,019 --> 01:27:57,753
<i>it's bad acting.</i>

1524
01:27:57,755 --> 01:27:59,420
In fact,
you've got the only neck

1525
01:27:59,422 --> 01:28:01,192
that could carry
this necklace off.

1526
01:28:02,359 --> 01:28:03,993
<i>I almost
never throw up.</i>

1527
01:28:03,995 --> 01:28:06,562
Even when I'm really wasted.

1528
01:28:06,564 --> 01:28:08,030
It was in the water.

1529
01:28:08,032 --> 01:28:09,872
It must have fallen off
while you were running.

1530
01:28:11,969 --> 01:28:14,703
<i>And last but not least,</i>

1531
01:28:14,705 --> 01:28:16,504
<i>I never forget a face.</i>

1532
01:28:16,506 --> 01:28:17,875
<i>Debbie Ocean.</i>

1533
01:28:20,245 --> 01:28:22,276
Yeah. Yeah.

1534
01:28:22,278 --> 01:28:25,179
So, seems to me,
eight shares of 150 million

1535
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:28,252
is better than seven shares
of nothing, right?

1536
01:28:29,586 --> 01:28:30,886
Chilly!

1537
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:32,388
Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!

1538
01:28:32,390 --> 01:28:33,923
Let's not all high-five
at once.

1539
01:28:33,925 --> 01:28:36,357
Plus, I am the one
who is saving your asses

1540
01:28:36,359 --> 01:28:38,093
- from insurance fraud.
- What?

1541
01:28:38,095 --> 01:28:40,163
- Insurance fraud?
- I was gonna get to that.

1542
01:28:40,165 --> 01:28:41,597
When?

1543
01:28:41,599 --> 01:28:43,531
It seems that they've assigned
an insurance investigator...

1544
01:28:43,533 --> 01:28:45,834
Who's about to look up
your ass with a flashlight.

1545
01:28:45,836 --> 01:28:47,869
- Who?
- This little <i>Columbo</i> dude,

1546
01:28:47,871 --> 01:28:48,971
everything
but the trench coat.

1547
01:28:48,973 --> 01:28:50,071
Totally on to you.

1548
01:28:50,073 --> 01:28:52,008
His name is John Frazier.

1549
01:28:52,010 --> 01:28:53,375
- You know him?
- Yes.

1550
01:28:53,377 --> 01:28:55,044
He busted my father twice
and my brother once.

1551
01:28:55,046 --> 01:28:56,178
He's family.

1552
01:28:56,180 --> 01:28:57,678
All right.
Lest we forget,

1553
01:28:57,680 --> 01:29:00,182
this entire enterprise
was to keep me out of jail.

1554
01:29:00,184 --> 01:29:01,583
Hey. No one's going to jail.

1555
01:29:01,585 --> 01:29:03,584
- Are you sure?
- We expected this.

1556
01:29:03,586 --> 01:29:04,820
We prepared for this.

1557
01:29:04,822 --> 01:29:06,789
Yup, that's clear.

1558
01:29:06,791 --> 01:29:09,691
We will not be
the prime suspect.

1559
01:29:09,693 --> 01:29:11,593
Okay, well then
who will be the prime suspect?

1560
01:29:11,595 --> 01:29:13,896
There's a few.
We've got the security guys,

1561
01:29:13,898 --> 01:29:15,196
we've got the busboys...

1562
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:17,201
The shady guy
who put you away.

1563
01:29:19,435 --> 01:29:21,035
Wow!

1564
01:29:21,037 --> 01:29:23,539
The boyfriend.

1565
01:29:23,541 --> 01:29:26,441
<i>Yup. They were gonna
be looking for somebody.</i>

1566
01:29:26,443 --> 01:29:29,080
Just had to make sure
it wasn't one of us.

1567
01:29:30,014 --> 01:29:31,480
It's nice.

1568
01:29:31,482 --> 01:29:33,280
Thanks.

1569
01:29:33,282 --> 01:29:35,618
That is amazing!
The precision...

1570
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,886
Right?

1571
01:29:36,888 --> 01:29:37,852
It's always
the attention to detail

1572
01:29:37,854 --> 01:29:39,120
and the little grace notes

1573
01:29:39,122 --> 01:29:41,960
that really make
something sing.

1574
01:29:43,094 --> 01:29:44,929
Why are you doing this?

1575
01:29:45,496 --> 01:29:46,531
Uh...

1576
01:29:48,632 --> 01:29:51,866
I don't have that many close
female friendships.

1577
01:29:51,868 --> 01:29:53,468
And book clubs are the worst.

1578
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:55,603
So I just thought

1579
01:29:55,605 --> 01:29:57,272
this could be
something fun to share.

1580
01:29:57,274 --> 01:29:59,243
You're becoming a criminal
because you're lonely?

1581
01:30:00,612 --> 01:30:02,977
Who isn't sometimes, right?

1582
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:04,415
Are you an only child?

1583
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:08,816
<i>Midsummer Night's
Dream</i> in Miami?

1584
01:30:08,818 --> 01:30:10,585
It's Shakespeare.

1585
01:30:10,587 --> 01:30:13,655
She did summer stock
at Williamstown,

1586
01:30:13,657 --> 01:30:15,023
plus a bunch of off-Broadway.

1587
01:30:15,025 --> 01:30:16,325
What about this one?
She looks good.

1588
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:18,325
Let's see. Regional theater,

1589
01:30:18,327 --> 01:30:20,094
<i>but she trained at Juilliard.</i>

1590
01:30:20,096 --> 01:30:21,196
It's really
a magnificent piece.

1591
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:22,263
This was your mother's?

1592
01:30:22,265 --> 01:30:24,834
Left to me after her passing.

1593
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,370
A Swedish prince
gave it to her

1594
01:30:27,372 --> 01:30:30,605
in exchange
for her deflowering.

1595
01:30:30,607 --> 01:30:32,173
Are they worth something?

1596
01:30:32,175 --> 01:30:34,241
Yes, they're worth
quite a lot.

1597
01:30:34,243 --> 01:30:37,612
"Take these,"
my mother said. "Now, go."

1598
01:30:37,614 --> 01:30:38,949
It was moonlight,

1599
01:30:39,516 --> 01:30:41,383
and then he said,

1600
01:30:41,385 --> 01:30:44,656
"I'd give you every star
in that sky."

1601
01:30:45,589 --> 01:30:47,755
I'm sorry.

1602
01:30:47,757 --> 01:30:49,559
It must be difficult for you.

1603
01:30:53,397 --> 01:30:55,062
- Claude Becker?
- Yeah.

1604
01:30:55,064 --> 01:30:56,231
- John Frazier.
- Hi.

1605
01:30:56,233 --> 01:30:58,468
SPD Insurance. How are you?

1606
01:30:59,437 --> 01:31:01,372
So, Claude...

1607
01:31:02,239 --> 01:31:04,442
Like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

1608
01:31:05,009 --> 01:31:06,174
Isn't it?

1609
01:31:06,176 --> 01:31:07,342
What do you want?

1610
01:31:07,344 --> 01:31:10,712
Here are some photographs
of you

1611
01:31:10,714 --> 01:31:12,146
with Miss Kluger.

1612
01:31:12,148 --> 01:31:13,615
Now, as you can see,
there are many photographs

1613
01:31:13,617 --> 01:31:16,285
where your hand
is on the back of her neck.

1614
01:31:16,287 --> 01:31:18,719
I don't really remember
where my hands were.

1615
01:31:18,721 --> 01:31:21,089
Ah. To be you.

1616
01:31:21,091 --> 01:31:22,292
Right?

1617
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,093
Problem is,

1618
01:31:25,095 --> 01:31:26,428
the necklace has been stolen

1619
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:28,297
and a fake has been put
in its place.

1620
01:31:28,299 --> 01:31:29,431
Right now, you're the person

1621
01:31:29,433 --> 01:31:30,700
with the greatest
opportunity...

1622
01:31:30,702 --> 01:31:32,935
Why would I wanna steal
a necklace?

1623
01:31:32,937 --> 01:31:34,973
That's what
I keep asking myself.

1624
01:31:35,906 --> 01:31:37,507
Why would this guy,

1625
01:31:39,742 --> 01:31:41,345
who's got everything,

1626
01:31:42,613 --> 01:31:44,015
two of these...

1627
01:31:45,549 --> 01:31:48,152
Why would that guy wanna
steal a necklace?

1628
01:31:50,053 --> 01:31:51,589
What was your answer?

1629
01:31:53,189 --> 01:31:55,125
Maybe he doesn't have
everything.

1630
01:31:55,893 --> 01:31:57,093
I think we're done here.

1631
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,459
- Just a theory.
- Really.

1632
01:31:58,461 --> 01:31:59,794
- A shot in the dark.
- We're done.

1633
01:31:59,796 --> 01:32:01,228
I'm probably wrong.

1634
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:04,165
It's a beautiful piece,
and I want you to have it.

1635
01:32:04,167 --> 01:32:06,571
I can't go any lower.
Just hold on one second.

1636
01:32:08,872 --> 01:32:10,073
Hello?

1637
01:32:11,074 --> 01:32:12,374
Oh, hey.

1638
01:32:12,376 --> 01:32:13,875
Hi.

1639
01:32:13,877 --> 01:32:15,343
What're you doing right now?

1640
01:32:22,853 --> 01:32:24,085
Hello, John.

1641
01:32:24,087 --> 01:32:25,387
Hello, Debbie.

1642
01:32:25,389 --> 01:32:27,222
You look well,
how long's it been?

1643
01:32:27,224 --> 01:32:30,224
A few years.
Minus good behavior.

1644
01:32:30,226 --> 01:32:31,793
- Right.
- Yeah.

1645
01:32:31,795 --> 01:32:34,096
Thank you for calling.
I was gonna call you.

1646
01:32:34,098 --> 01:32:36,132
- Yeah, I didn't do it.
- Of course not.

1647
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:37,665
You were just on camera
20 feet away

1648
01:32:37,667 --> 01:32:39,000
while the jewels
were being nicked.

1649
01:32:39,002 --> 01:32:40,267
It's a coincidence.

1650
01:32:40,269 --> 01:32:42,169
No. That's a solid alibi.

1651
01:32:42,171 --> 01:32:43,538
What is it? Is it genetic?

1652
01:32:43,540 --> 01:32:45,240
Are the whole family
like this?

1653
01:32:45,242 --> 01:32:46,441
Except for my aunt Ida.

1654
01:32:46,443 --> 01:32:48,576
- Librarian?
- Mmm. Homemaker.

1655
01:32:48,578 --> 01:32:50,012
Right, I'm gonna
make this easy for you.

1656
01:32:50,014 --> 01:32:51,681
I don't want you.

1657
01:32:53,116 --> 01:32:54,516
I just want the necklace.

1658
01:32:54,518 --> 01:32:56,250
I don't care.
I'll say I found it in a cab.

1659
01:32:56,252 --> 01:32:57,788
How about some of it?

1660
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:03,325
- How much?
- Hypothetically, 10%.

1661
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,959
And where's
the hypothetical rest?

1662
01:33:04,961 --> 01:33:07,829
Oh, I don't know. Literally.

1663
01:33:07,831 --> 01:33:10,664
Oh, God. This is exhausting!

1664
01:33:10,666 --> 01:33:14,570
I mean, when they said
come over, I was like... Ugh.

1665
01:33:14,572 --> 01:33:16,638
You know, with the jet lag,
the time difference,

1666
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:18,539
Arsenal in the Cup Final
this weekend.

1667
01:33:18,541 --> 01:33:20,843
But now I'm here.
It's bloody interesting.

1668
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:21,846
Yeah?

1669
01:33:27,317 --> 01:33:30,185
So it's not just profit,
it's revenge.

1670
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:32,620
It's a twofer.

1671
01:33:32,622 --> 01:33:35,123
He frames you, you frame him,
scores are settled.

1672
01:33:35,125 --> 01:33:36,458
I'm just the courier.

1673
01:33:36,460 --> 01:33:39,460
All is right with the world,
it's brilliant.

1674
01:33:39,462 --> 01:33:40,995
Just trying to help out
an old friend.

1675
01:33:40,997 --> 01:33:44,298
You know, one day, you are
gonna have to let this go?

1676
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,336
And one day, I will.

1677
01:33:47,604 --> 01:33:51,507
Let's just say,
for argument's sake,

1678
01:33:51,509 --> 01:33:54,112
that I do know where there's
a part of that necklace.

1679
01:33:55,211 --> 01:33:56,813
Can you get a search warrant?

1680
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:01,516
I'd need
probable cause.

1681
01:34:01,518 --> 01:34:05,754
Well, we may or may not be
working on that right now.

1682
01:34:09,792 --> 01:34:11,562
Do you wanna play a game?

1683
01:34:13,197 --> 01:34:14,665
What kind of game?

1684
01:34:16,634 --> 01:34:18,202
A card game.

1685
01:34:20,970 --> 01:34:22,639
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh?

1686
01:34:25,407 --> 01:34:26,710
- Uh-huh?
- Yes, yes!

1687
01:34:35,452 --> 01:34:36,785
I'll be right back.

1688
01:34:36,787 --> 01:34:38,756
Where are you going?

1689
01:34:39,823 --> 01:34:40,825
Wait.

1690
01:35:00,409 --> 01:35:02,444
Where are you?

1691
01:35:02,446 --> 01:35:04,681
I'll be right there.

1692
01:36:11,314 --> 01:36:15,115
You have no idea how this
came to be in your possession?

1693
01:36:15,117 --> 01:36:16,519
No.

1694
01:36:17,755 --> 01:36:19,587
But you were Ms. Kluger's date

1695
01:36:19,589 --> 01:36:22,057
the night
these necklaces were switched.

1696
01:36:22,059 --> 01:36:23,594
Yes, I was.

1697
01:36:25,095 --> 01:36:28,899
Does that strike you
as a rather large coincidence?

1698
01:36:32,636 --> 01:36:36,271
Including a 33.18, D color,
internally flawless diamond...

1699
01:36:36,273 --> 01:36:38,205
<i>Are you familiar
with a company called</i>

1700
01:36:38,207 --> 01:36:40,374
<i>Becker Holdings, LLC?</i>

1701
01:36:40,376 --> 01:36:41,744
<i>Of course.</i>

1702
01:36:41,746 --> 01:36:44,812
<i>Well, it seems
four sweet old ladies,</i>

1703
01:36:44,814 --> 01:36:47,583
<i>who apparently don't exist,</i>

1704
01:36:47,585 --> 01:36:51,085
<i>have recently transferred some
very large sums of money</i>

1705
01:36:51,087 --> 01:36:53,957
<i>into Becker Holdings, LLC.</i>

1706
01:36:56,292 --> 01:36:59,362
<i>Do you know how that might
have happened, Mr. Becker?</i>

1707
01:37:04,835 --> 01:37:07,201
I think
I need to talk to my lawyer.

1708
01:37:07,203 --> 01:37:09,939
I think you do.

1709
01:37:17,547 --> 01:37:19,580
- To our dear friend Carl...
- Claude.

1710
01:37:19,582 --> 01:37:24,352
Claude Becker. May he rest
in peace in prison.

1711
01:37:24,354 --> 01:37:25,620
Cheers.

1712
01:37:25,622 --> 01:37:27,054
Love you,
love you, love you.

1713
01:37:27,056 --> 01:37:28,091
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1714
01:37:29,225 --> 01:37:30,426
I have a question.

1715
01:37:30,428 --> 01:37:31,927
So...

1716
01:37:31,929 --> 01:37:33,695
It's good
that he went to jail,

1717
01:37:33,697 --> 01:37:35,763
'cause it's great
that we didn't.

1718
01:37:35,765 --> 01:37:40,535
But if you only sold
the jewels for 85 million,

1719
01:37:40,537 --> 01:37:42,706
how does it work out
that we get 16 apiece?

1720
01:37:45,341 --> 01:37:46,708
Do you wanna?

1721
01:37:46,710 --> 01:37:49,210
You thought we were just
gonna steal one necklace?

1722
01:37:49,212 --> 01:37:52,813
What do you think we are,
a bunch of pussies?

1723
01:37:52,815 --> 01:37:54,282
<i>See, while everyone
was worried</i>

1724
01:37:54,284 --> 01:37:55,816
<i>about what was happening
around your neck...</i>

1725
01:37:55,818 --> 01:37:57,819
<i>And you were
hurling your guts out...</i>

1726
01:37:57,821 --> 01:37:59,023
<i>Thanks for that, by the way.</i>

1727
01:37:59,922 --> 01:38:01,054
It was amazing.

1728
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:02,423
That was really impressive.

1729
01:38:02,425 --> 01:38:03,724
That was really nice,
actually.

1730
01:38:03,726 --> 01:38:06,861
The place
kinda went on lockdown.

1731
01:38:06,863 --> 01:38:08,329
<i>The kitchen
was cleared out, too.</i>

1732
01:38:08,331 --> 01:38:11,098
<i>And while everyone
was watching the entrance,</i>

1733
01:38:11,100 --> 01:38:13,103
<i>we thought we'd check out
the exhibit.</i>

1734
01:38:15,206 --> 01:38:18,442
Because why would you
just steal one necklace,

1735
01:38:20,543 --> 01:38:23,811
when you could steal more?

1736
01:38:23,813 --> 01:38:26,513
- Holy shit!
- Holy shit!

1737
01:38:26,515 --> 01:38:27,982
That's a lot.

1738
01:38:27,984 --> 01:38:29,284
Yeah.

1739
01:38:29,286 --> 01:38:32,154
We didn't just print
the Toussaint from that thing.

1740
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:33,754
<i>We printed a lot of jewels.</i>

1741
01:38:33,756 --> 01:38:36,691
<i>Felt like I was
working at Kinko's.</i>

1742
01:38:36,693 --> 01:38:38,826
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

1743
01:38:38,828 --> 01:38:40,831
<i>I decided to visit
an old friend.</i>

1744
01:38:49,206 --> 01:38:52,874
<i>Amazon sells
these 20-foot selfie sticks.</i>

1745
01:38:52,876 --> 01:38:55,879
<i>All they saw
was a quick, little blur.</i>

1746
01:38:59,448 --> 01:39:01,016
<i>It was a temporary
exhibit and they built</i>

1747
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:02,618
<i>this metal grid
to hang the dresses from.</i>

1748
01:39:03,754 --> 01:39:07,824
<i>We just decided to suspend Yen
from that as well.</i>

1749
01:39:26,675 --> 01:39:28,543
What if somebody came in?

1750
01:39:28,545 --> 01:39:30,078
Oh. Somebody did.

1751
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:31,547
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't
be here. We're clearing

1752
01:39:31,549 --> 01:39:34,018
this whole area.

1753
01:40:12,989 --> 01:40:15,091
Ma'am.

1754
01:40:16,992 --> 01:40:17,995
Calm down.

1755
01:40:32,742 --> 01:40:34,612
We're okay.

1756
01:41:09,912 --> 01:41:12,347
<i>Stealing the necklace
was great,</i>

1757
01:41:12,349 --> 01:41:13,681
but without that diversion,

1758
01:41:13,683 --> 01:41:15,115
without clearing out
the exhibit...

1759
01:41:15,117 --> 01:41:17,384
We wouldn't have been
able to grab these.

1760
01:41:17,386 --> 01:41:18,687
These,

1761
01:41:18,689 --> 01:41:23,958
which bring your cuts to
$38,300,000 each.

1762
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,426
- Huh?
- Yeah.

1763
01:41:41,946 --> 01:41:43,846
Yeah.

1764
01:41:46,015 --> 01:41:48,719
Yeah, I know.
It's so beautiful.

1765
01:42:00,964 --> 01:42:03,330
Sweetie, I know,
but you can't put gum

1766
01:42:03,332 --> 01:42:05,232
in your sister's hair.

1767
01:42:05,234 --> 01:42:08,072
I don't care if she tried
to put it in your nose first.

1768
01:42:21,918 --> 01:42:23,851
What's up, YouTube?
It's your girl!

1769
01:42:23,853 --> 01:42:24,986
Check out my new crib.

1770
01:42:24,988 --> 01:42:27,024
I'm on the co-op board.

1771
01:42:31,761 --> 01:42:34,361
- Cut!
- That's a cut!

1772
01:42:34,363 --> 01:42:35,883
- Cut, cut, cut!
- That's a cut!

1773
01:42:36,698 --> 01:42:38,200
Resetting back to one.

1774
01:42:38,202 --> 01:42:40,133
Uh, just, you know...
Smoother.

1775
01:42:40,135 --> 01:42:42,737
Just a little bit of space,
please. It was perfect.

1776
01:42:42,739 --> 01:42:44,338
I just need it faster
and more damaged.

1777
01:42:44,340 --> 01:42:45,973
All right? Great.

1778
01:42:45,975 --> 01:42:47,777
It's not that hard!

1779
01:44:05,654 --> 01:44:07,190
You would've loved it.

1780
01:44:08,994 --> 01:44:13,994
