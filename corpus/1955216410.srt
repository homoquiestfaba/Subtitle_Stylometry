1
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,739
People are throwing colored powder
and buckets of water at each other...

2
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,697
and I keep getting hit in the face
with this stuff.

3
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:14,907
So at this point, I must look like
some kind of crazy clown.

4
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:19,450
And all the while, we're trying to carry on
this incredibly serious discussion...

5
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,706
about antique furniture.

6
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,878
And he's telling me about this piece that
he's found that he thinks I might like.

7
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,208
And then, out of nowhere, he says...

8
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,173
I'm pregnant.

9
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,088
Seriously?

10
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:56,784
It is beautiful.

11
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,450
It's crazy.

12
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,958
Baby, I don't want to go back.

13
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What if we stayed here?

14
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:09,755
Started a family here.

15
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,296
Are you serious?

16
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:13,466
Why not?

17
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:17,510
I'm going to have to come three times
a year to source antiques anyway.

18
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,887
What's to keep us from
setting up our base here?

19
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,770
What do you think?

20
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,231
I don't know.

21
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:30,438
This yours?

22
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,742
Hey.

23
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,699
What are you saying?

24
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:42,407
I'm asking her if you and I
should stay here forever.

25
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,879
How can you sleep?

26
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,380
So peacefully!

27
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:34,173
Sweetheart, stop. Stop.

28
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,514
It's okay, it's okay, I'm here.

29
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,929
It's okay.

30
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:38,637
Stop it, stop it.

31
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,717
I'm here, I'm here. It's okay.

32
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,352
I got you. It's okay, I got you.

33
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,669
Winston, come on.

34
00:04:12,461 --> 00:04:13,461
Winston.

35
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,378
Good boy! Good boy.

36
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,798
Come on, boy.

37
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,295
Come on, Winston.

38
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,518
Lucy.

39
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,559
Come on.

40
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:32,768
Morning, sweetheart.

41
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,194
- Morning.
- How did you sleep?

42
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:35,233
Good.

43
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,395
Morning, Piki.

44
00:04:36,443 --> 00:04:37,573
Morning, sir.

45
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,254
Michael.

46
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:58,721
Yeah, what's up?

47
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:02,885
I am...

48
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,020
Hey, you don't have to say anything, okay?

49
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,727
I'm lost, Michael.
I don't know if I can live with it.

50
00:05:09,768 --> 00:05:10,888
We're going to be fine.

51
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:15,726
We'll get through this.

52
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,396
Maria?

53
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:45,947
Hello?

54
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,776
Mrs. Harwood
retired early for the night, sir.

55
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,196
She had a migraine.

56
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:52,665
I put Lucy to bed.

57
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,206
Right.

58
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,001
Okay.

59
00:06:58,043 --> 00:06:58,923
'Night, sir.

60
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,091
Night-night, Piki.

61
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,251
Those are F and G fingers.

62
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,507
F and G fingers.

63
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,378
Wrists up like there's an orange.

64
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:50,105
And a one, two,
a one, two, three, four!

65
00:08:12,075 --> 00:08:13,275
What?

66
00:08:13,702 --> 00:08:15,162
Yeah!

67
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,751
Well done.

68
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,249
A bunch of scribbles.

69
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:20,330
You guys are fantastic!
Was that really you playing?

70
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,134
It was too good. You sure it wasn't Mommy?

71
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,546
No.

72
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,007
You're telling me it was
really you playing?

73
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,680
That's basically it.

74
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,550
- Can't believe it! My children are geniuses.
- Yeah.

75
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:35,886
- I'm so proud of you both.
- They worked on it all day just for you.

76
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,233
Happy Father's Day.

77
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,304
We're going to get through this.

78
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:18,099
Maria?

79
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,805
Maria!

80
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,982
Maria! Open your eyes, sweetheart.

81
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,978
Can you hear me? Maria?

82
00:09:28,026 --> 00:09:29,396
I need you to listen to my voice, please.

83
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:30,784
Sweetheart, I need you to focus, okay?

84
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,781
I need you to fight this. Please!

85
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:34,703
Maria, I can't live without you.

86
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,121
Mommy!

87
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,412
Please help me.

88
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,615
Mommy! Mommy!

89
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,706
Mommy, I can't get free!

90
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,631
My leg's stuck!

91
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,129
Luce?

92
00:09:48,172 --> 00:09:49,712
Lucy. No, no, no.

93
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:51,296
Lucy, please wake up, baby.

94
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,061
- Mommy, get me out!
- Lucy, please wake up!

95
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,010
No, no, no!

96
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,972
Mommy, I can't get free! It hurts!

97
00:10:05,314 --> 00:10:06,944
Please get me out!

98
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:14,855
Okay, okay.

99
00:10:14,907 --> 00:10:16,157
Please wake up.

100
00:10:17,451 --> 00:10:18,241
I'm scared!

101
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:21,005
I know you're scared!
I'm scared, too! Pull!

102
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:23,038
Okay? Oliver, come on.

103
00:10:23,081 --> 00:10:25,461
I don't care if it hurts, you have to pull.
You have to pull!

104
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,001
I know it hurts. You have to pull.

105
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,762
Keep your nose up.

106
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,338
Keep your nose all the way up.

107
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,014
Keep your nose on the ceiling.

108
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:37,143
We're all going to be okay.

109
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,683
Okay. Okay.

110
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,430
Baby.

111
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:48,440
I don't know what to do.

112
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,362
Please don't leave me!

113
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,530
I'm sorry, baby.

114
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:52,818
Mommy!

115
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:11,301
We need help! Please.

116
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,420
Please, somebody!

117
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,585
We need help!

118
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,883
My boy's in the car!

119
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:17,756
My boy's in the car! Please!

120
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:25,226
No! No! My boy!

121
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,689
Ollie!

122
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:29,274
No, my boy's in the car!

123
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,404
We need to get my boy!

124
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:33,111
Ollie!

125
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,191
Ollie!

126
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:49,996
Michael.

127
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,003
Yeah.

128
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,554
She's going to be fine.
But she took a lot of pills.

129
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:07,353
You are in Bombay Hospital.

130
00:12:11,315 --> 00:12:12,735
Where's Michael?

131
00:12:13,734 --> 00:12:16,364
He's talking to the doctor.

132
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,241
You are lucky to be alive, Mrs. Harwood.

133
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,026
I just can't bear life without him.

134
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,578
I had a daughter once.

135
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:36,258
Anushka.

136
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,894
She fell into a pond while
trying to pick some plants.

137
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,761
I was looking away for only one minute.

138
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:54,187
What if I could bring your son
back to you just one more time?

139
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,779
What if I could give you the chance
to say your final goodbye?

140
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,283
What are you talking about?

141
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,951
I was born in a village in South India.

142
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,582
Surrounding our village
was a big forest.

143
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,925
And deep within this forest...

144
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,803
there was an abandoned temple.

145
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:23,718
It is said that the line between
the world of the dead and the living...

146
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,388
is very thin at this place.

147
00:13:33,397 --> 00:13:35,477
You should go there.

148
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:38,650
Take the ashes of your son...

149
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:41,736
spread them on the steps
of this temple...

150
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:43,986
lock yourself inside...

151
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:46,489
and when night comes...

152
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,584
he will come to you.

153
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:53,787
And you will be able to talk to him
through the door of the temple...

154
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,286
say your final goodbye.

155
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:05,144
I will leave you two alone.

156
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,538
I was so scared I lost you.

157
00:14:36,585 --> 00:14:37,715
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:39,213 --> 00:14:41,263
I'm so, so sorry.

159
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,059
Come on.

160
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,194
Come on, boy.

161
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,625
If we do this...

162
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,786
you have to promise me one thing.

163
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:59,460
When Oliver comes to you at the temple,
you will be able to speak to him.

164
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,920
But no matter what you do...

165
00:16:03,422 --> 00:16:07,472
no matter what he says
or how much ever he pleads...

166
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:12,433
you must not open the door.

167
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,972
Promise me.

168
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:15,596
I promise.

169
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,534
It has been too long.

170
00:17:16,495 --> 00:17:17,705
Let me go.

171
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,050
Khan.

172
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:26,772
They are the Aghori.

173
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,283
They live by the cremation sites.

174
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,910
They cover themselves in the ashes...

175
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:37,117
and they feed off the flesh of the dead.

176
00:18:39,286 --> 00:18:43,116
For they believe it helps them communicate
with the other side.

177
00:19:09,441 --> 00:19:12,441
My village is the last stop,
then follow my instructions.

178
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,486
God, Michael.

179
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:14,449
I will give him your note.

180
00:19:14,488 --> 00:19:16,608
No, he's going to be frantic,
and Lucy needs to know where I am.

181
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,657
I will take care of everything.

182
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,145
Dear Michael, please don't be worried.

183
00:19:53,193 --> 00:19:55,703
I'm just taking a couple of days
to sort my head out.

184
00:19:56,989 --> 00:19:59,699
I desperately want to find a way
to move on...

185
00:19:59,741 --> 00:20:02,081
so that we can be a family again.

186
00:20:03,704 --> 00:20:07,044
I love you and Lucy so, so much.

187
00:20:07,499 --> 00:20:09,749
Be home soon. Maria.

188
00:23:56,937 --> 00:23:59,807
I love you so much.

189
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:57,533
Who's there?

190
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,200
Oliver?

191
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,711
Who are you?

192
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:22,221
Oliver?

193
00:29:22,638 --> 00:29:23,718
Mommy?

194
00:29:26,141 --> 00:29:27,731
Mommy, is that you?

195
00:29:28,101 --> 00:29:30,441
Oliver, it's Mommy. Can you hear me?

196
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:31,479
Yes.

197
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,357
Yes, I can hear you.

198
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,941
Where am I, Mommy?

199
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:37,824
Baby, press yourself close.

200
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:40,241
Come up right against the door
and press yourself close...

201
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,120
so we can be close together, okay?

202
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:45,037
Are you there?

203
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:46,287
Yes, Mommy.

204
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,340
Oliver, I miss you.

205
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,924
I miss you so much, baby.

206
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:00,381
You know I love you, right?

207
00:30:01,552 --> 00:30:03,262
More than life itself.

208
00:30:03,303 --> 00:30:04,473
I miss you, too.

209
00:30:05,097 --> 00:30:06,637
I miss Daddy and Lucy.

210
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:11,055
Oliver, Momma has something to tell you.

211
00:30:12,437 --> 00:30:15,857
I came here because
I wanted to say that I'm sorry.

212
00:30:17,526 --> 00:30:19,686
I'm sorry for leaving you.

213
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:21,912
It wasn't your fault.

214
00:30:25,534 --> 00:30:26,994
I love you, Mommy.

215
00:30:27,035 --> 00:30:29,825
Baby, I think about you day and night.

216
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,498
I wish I could hold you in my arms.

217
00:30:39,548 --> 00:30:41,298
The door won't open.

218
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:42,511
I can't get in.

219
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,601
I know, baby.
I'm not allowed to let you in.

220
00:30:46,305 --> 00:30:50,025
It's dark out here. I want to come in.

221
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:53,228
I'm sorry. I can't do it.

222
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:57,320
Please, Mommy, open the door.
I want to hug you.

223
00:30:58,108 --> 00:30:59,608
It's okay, baby.

224
00:31:00,736 --> 00:31:03,606
It's okay to cry. Mommy's crying, too.

225
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:07,584
I have to go now, Mommy.

226
00:31:07,618 --> 00:31:08,618
What?

227
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:10,540
I have to go back now, Mommy.

228
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,789
No!

229
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,580
No, you just got here.

230
00:31:14,291 --> 00:31:17,591
No, please. Baby, no, don't go.

231
00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:20,668
Don't go. I just want
a few more minutes, okay?

232
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:22,764
Just a few more minutes, baby.

233
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,299
Please. Please, Oliver!

234
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:30,312
Where are you?

235
00:31:35,312 --> 00:31:36,402
Ollie?

236
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:38,984
Oliver!

237
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:41,736
Oliver!

238
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:51,075
I love you, baby.

239
00:32:54,224 --> 00:32:55,604
Maria?

240
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:56,944
Maria?

241
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:01,310
Maria.

242
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:16,335
There's nobody out here.

243
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,133
Quiet! Buddy, what's wrong with you?

244
00:33:27,174 --> 00:33:28,224
Relax.

245
00:33:28,258 --> 00:33:29,338
Are you all right?

246
00:33:30,427 --> 00:33:32,297
Hey, sweetheart. What are you doing up?

247
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:34,256
Is Mommy home?

248
00:33:34,723 --> 00:33:36,473
No, not yet. She will be soon.

249
00:33:36,517 --> 00:33:38,017
Let's get you back to bed. Come on.

250
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:42,616
How much tea would you like?

251
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,250
The whole glass.

252
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:51,554
That's not how
you're supposed to drink tea.

253
00:34:51,842 --> 00:34:54,472
You're supposed to drink tea like this.

254
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:26,792
Khan?

255
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:30,135
Where did you come from?

256
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,496
Mommy!

257
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:47,214
Hello.

258
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,786
I missed you so much.

259
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,536
I missed you, too.

260
00:36:53,547 --> 00:36:55,297
Stop it! That tickles!

261
00:36:59,344 --> 00:37:02,144
Lucy, let's get Winston a snack.

262
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,061
- Come.
- Come on, Winston.

263
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:05,558
Come.

264
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,270
I was worried sick. Where were you?

265
00:37:08,312 --> 00:37:09,942
I was trying to get better.

266
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,440
You couldn't have...

267
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,111
We would have come with you.

268
00:37:13,150 --> 00:37:14,530
I know, I know.

269
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,875
Hey, I'm back.

270
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:26,996
I'm really back. I'm back for you.

271
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:28,579
I'm back for Lucy.

272
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:01,135
What's going on?

273
00:39:01,175 --> 00:39:03,845
It's okay, it's okay. It's just Winston.

274
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:05,796
I got him.

275
00:39:10,893 --> 00:39:12,193
Come on, you.

276
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:27,446
Go to bed. Go to bed.

277
00:40:02,236 --> 00:40:03,646
Momma's here now.

278
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:05,628
Miss Lucy?

279
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,179
Where are you?

280
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:35,041
Ooh, ooh, my name is

281
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:37,788
L-I L-I chicka-ni chicka-ni

282
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:40,541
Ooh, ooh, my name is

283
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:43,344
L-I L-I chicka-ni chicka-ni

284
00:41:43,378 --> 00:41:45,918
Ooh, ooh, my name is

285
00:41:45,964 --> 00:41:47,924
L-I L-I chicka...

286
00:41:49,009 --> 00:41:50,259
Hello, Mommy.

287
00:41:52,429 --> 00:41:54,309
What you doing in here, Luce?

288
00:41:55,807 --> 00:41:57,927
Just playing with my dolls.

289
00:41:57,976 --> 00:41:59,686
And who were you talking to?

290
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:02,400
Just my dolls.

291
00:42:03,273 --> 00:42:04,403
Okay.

292
00:42:05,442 --> 00:42:08,532
Well, you know that Momma doesn't like
people playing up here, right?

293
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:12,570
So how about we go back downstairs?

294
00:42:13,283 --> 00:42:14,283
Okay, Mommy.

295
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,325
Scoot, scoot, scoot.

296
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:28,512
Mommy, are you coming?

297
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:30,049
Yeah, I'll be right there, babe.

298
00:43:13,177 --> 00:43:15,387
Miss Lucy, that sounds...

299
00:43:38,118 --> 00:43:39,828
Hey, Luce, where did you get Khan?

300
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:44,874
Hey.

301
00:43:45,876 --> 00:43:47,786
Hey, look at me, Luce.

302
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:54,798
I have something to show you,
but it's a secret.

303
00:43:55,385 --> 00:44:00,175
Lucy, I need you to tell me
where you got the tiger, okay?

304
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:04,523
Did Piki give him to you?

305
00:44:05,979 --> 00:44:07,149
Look, Mommy.

306
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:12,896
Lucy, please stop.

307
00:44:13,529 --> 00:44:14,609
Lucy.

308
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:17,495
Lucy, I need to talk to you about...

309
00:44:29,586 --> 00:44:31,756
Oliver's come back, Mommy.

310
00:45:08,542 --> 00:45:10,922
Nighty-night, sleep you tight.

311
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,051
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

312
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:19,260
You won't tell Daddy, will you?

313
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:21,100
About Oliver.

314
00:45:22,764 --> 00:45:24,474
Why do you say that, love?

315
00:45:27,102 --> 00:45:29,062
I think Oliver's hiding.

316
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:32,518
Who's he hiding from?

317
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,396
He doesn't want to tell me.

318
00:45:34,443 --> 00:45:36,153
Just don't tell Daddy.

319
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:42,949
Well, what if we wait until
Oliver's ready to tell him?

320
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,327
Promise?

321
00:45:46,121 --> 00:45:47,911
Yeah, I promise.

322
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:50,579
Get some sleep.

323
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:53,499
I love you.

324
00:45:59,468 --> 00:46:00,678
Good night.

325
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:45,264
Good night.

326
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:46,805
Sleep tight.

327
00:46:47,516 --> 00:46:49,636
And don't let the bedbugs bite.

328
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:27,565
Okay.

329
00:47:29,308 --> 00:47:32,138
Okay, let's see where we left off.

330
00:47:41,862 --> 00:47:43,992
"Directly in front of him...

331
00:47:44,031 --> 00:47:45,991
"holding on by a low branch...

332
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:49,953
"stood a naked brown baby
who could just barely walk...

333
00:47:49,995 --> 00:47:54,755
"as soft and as dimpled a little atom
as ever came to a wolf's cave at night."

334
00:48:17,231 --> 00:48:18,771
Hey, sweetheart.

335
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:20,726
I was just coming to find you.

336
00:48:20,776 --> 00:48:22,486
Did I miss saying good night to Luce?

337
00:48:22,528 --> 00:48:24,648
It's okay.
I kissed her good night for you.

338
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:25,736
Okay.

339
00:48:26,448 --> 00:48:27,618
Sorry I was late.

340
00:48:28,116 --> 00:48:29,276
It's okay.

341
00:48:30,118 --> 00:48:31,698
Are you all right? You're trembling.

342
00:48:33,121 --> 00:48:34,331
I don't know.

343
00:48:34,373 --> 00:48:35,333
What's going on?

344
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:38,674
No, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm good.

345
00:48:38,710 --> 00:48:40,590
I'm really, really good.

346
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:43,474
Good.

347
00:49:44,985 --> 00:49:46,195
Hello.

348
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:48,149
Hello?

349
00:49:50,657 --> 00:49:51,827
Hello?

350
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:54,451
Oliver, where are you?

351
00:50:16,517 --> 00:50:18,137
What's going on? What happened?

352
00:50:18,185 --> 00:50:19,485
What happened, baby?

353
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:20,560
Are you all right?

354
00:50:20,604 --> 00:50:22,024
It's a dream. Just a dream.

355
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,320
- Sorry.
- Are you okay?

356
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,360
Yeah.

357
00:51:24,084 --> 00:51:25,084
Mommy!

358
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:28,707
Mommy!

359
00:51:30,591 --> 00:51:31,931
What is it, baby?

360
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:34,263
Chil and Bill are dead.

361
00:51:34,595 --> 00:51:35,595
What?

362
00:51:36,263 --> 00:51:38,893
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

363
00:51:40,434 --> 00:51:43,524
The gardener found all the fish
dead in the pond.

364
00:51:43,562 --> 00:51:46,112
And all the plants are dying.

365
00:51:50,944 --> 00:51:53,494
Can we bury Chil and Bill in the sea?

366
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:54,906
In the sea?

367
00:51:56,074 --> 00:51:59,584
Piki said people in India
get buried in the sea.

368
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:01,200
Of course. Yes, we can.

369
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:03,086
How about you go get something
to bury them in?

370
00:52:13,133 --> 00:52:15,093
You should have worn white.

371
00:52:15,135 --> 00:52:17,095
I wore a white scarf. That's not enough?

372
00:52:17,137 --> 00:52:18,137
No.

373
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,469
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude
to Chil and Bill.

374
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:24,476
It's a good spot right here.

375
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:33,820
Bye-bye, Chil. Bye-bye, Bill.

376
00:52:40,118 --> 00:52:42,118
Mommy, who's that man?

377
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:45,604
It's all right, baby. He's far away.

378
00:52:45,791 --> 00:52:47,131
Not that man, Mommy!

379
00:52:47,167 --> 00:52:48,167
That man!

380
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:06,311
Why did that man put ash on your face?

381
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:07,653
I don't know, love.

382
00:53:07,688 --> 00:53:08,978
Did I get it all?

383
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:10,022
Yeah, you got it.

384
00:53:10,983 --> 00:53:11,983
Yeah?

385
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,396
Luce stay behind me.

386
00:54:58,340 --> 00:54:59,630
Oliver?

387
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,720
Oliver, do you want to play?

388
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:17,230
Are you coming out to play, Stanley?

389
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:19,028
I can't.

390
00:55:19,403 --> 00:55:22,493
Someone painted the wall pink...

391
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:26,205
I got the blame.

392
00:55:34,168 --> 00:55:37,208
Detective Calamity at your service, sir.

393
00:55:38,547 --> 00:55:40,127
Do we have any clues?

394
00:55:40,174 --> 00:55:41,424
He did it! He did it!

395
00:56:04,364 --> 00:56:05,954
What is it, Winston?

396
00:56:07,367 --> 00:56:09,577
Sounds like you need a detective.

397
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:24,757
Look at you. Right where you belong.

398
00:56:27,387 --> 00:56:30,387
Okay, baby girl.
Let's get those nits out.

399
00:56:31,350 --> 00:56:33,310
I don't have nits.

400
00:56:33,352 --> 00:56:36,522
Nits like clean hair. Daddy told me.

401
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:38,983
Okay, well, then you certainly
don't have them, Grumpy-stiltskin.

402
00:56:39,024 --> 00:56:40,074
Turn around.

403
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:41,649
Turn around.

404
00:56:43,195 --> 00:56:45,205
Come on, come on, come on.

405
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:49,950
Lucy, what happened to your shoulder?

406
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:54,911
I don't think I like Oliver anymore.

407
00:56:54,957 --> 00:56:56,327
He's mean.

408
00:57:21,066 --> 00:57:23,606
Oliver, I saw those bite marks on Lucy.

409
00:57:24,778 --> 00:57:27,318
You can't hurt your sister, all right?

410
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:35,664
I said "no".

411
00:57:44,631 --> 00:57:46,011
Oliver, you let me out.

412
00:57:57,728 --> 00:57:58,898
Okay.

413
00:57:59,521 --> 00:58:00,811
I'll read to you.

414
00:58:00,856 --> 00:58:03,356
As long as you promise
not to hurt Lucy again.

415
00:58:06,486 --> 00:58:07,696
Will you promise me?

416
00:58:22,211 --> 00:58:24,301
"Shere Khan moved through the forest.

417
00:58:24,338 --> 00:58:27,918
"He heard the thunder of their hooves,
and lumbered down the ravine...

418
00:58:27,966 --> 00:58:30,546
"looking from side to side
for any way of escape."

419
00:58:44,983 --> 00:58:45,943
Hello?

420
00:58:45,984 --> 00:58:47,034
Hey, darling.

421
00:58:47,069 --> 00:58:49,649
How was your day?
Did you have fun with Luce?

422
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:51,356
Yeah, I just put her to bed.

423
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:52,406
Okay.

424
00:58:53,659 --> 00:58:56,409
I'm really sorry, but I've got to be here
for a couple more hours.

425
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:59,963
Shall I ask Piki to keep something warm
for you or are you going to eat there?

426
00:58:59,998 --> 00:59:01,208
No, it's okay.

427
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,130
I'm just going to grab something here.

428
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:06,168
But I just wanted to tell you
that I miss you.

429
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,383
I miss you, too.

430
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:11,054
All right. I love you.
Give Luce a kiss for me.

431
00:59:11,093 --> 00:59:12,513
Will do. Love you, too.

432
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:13,643
Bye.

433
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:32,511
Oliver?

434
01:01:08,544 --> 01:01:10,004
I see you there.

435
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:14,343
I'll call the police!

436
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:20,012
Go on!

437
01:01:24,184 --> 01:01:25,604
Go. Go!

438
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,227
Get out! Get out of my house!

439
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:13,735
You have no idea what you have done.

440
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:20,693
Did you think that you could bring back
somebody from the world of the dead...

441
01:02:20,908 --> 01:02:23,238
and they would be the same?

442
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:25,453
Did you think there would be
no consequences?

443
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:27,155
I don't understand.

444
01:02:27,497 --> 01:02:30,287
Hindus believe in the purification
and reincarnation of the soul.

445
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,745
That can never happen to Oliver now...

446
01:02:33,795 --> 01:02:36,455
because he has returned to this life.

447
01:02:36,507 --> 01:02:39,127
Instead, his soul will putrefy.

448
01:02:39,176 --> 01:02:40,886
You have seen her, haven't you?

449
01:02:40,928 --> 01:02:42,178
Myrtu.

450
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:45,886
She is getting closer to this world
every day.

451
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:49,063
When you opened the door, you upset
the balance between life and death...

452
01:02:49,102 --> 01:02:51,152
and you awoke her.

453
01:02:51,188 --> 01:02:54,018
She is the gatekeeper of the underworld.

454
01:02:54,775 --> 01:02:58,155
She is here to take Oliver back
to the world of the dead.

455
01:02:58,195 --> 01:03:01,745
And she will destroy anything
that comes in her way.

456
01:03:01,782 --> 01:03:04,412
Oliver is no longer your son,
Mrs. Harwood.

457
01:03:04,451 --> 01:03:06,951
Do you understand what I am telling you?

458
01:03:06,995 --> 01:03:09,115
He is evil.

459
01:03:10,624 --> 01:03:14,004
Burn every possession of his.
Destroy every photograph.

460
01:03:14,044 --> 01:03:17,264
Get rid of anything which is
an anchor for him to this life...

461
01:03:17,297 --> 01:03:19,417
and pray that he will return
to the world of the dead.

462
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:20,466
You are out of your mind.

463
01:03:20,717 --> 01:03:22,967
I should never have told you
about the temple!

464
01:03:25,806 --> 01:03:27,676
I thought I was trying to help you.

465
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:50,156
Lucy?

466
01:03:57,838 --> 01:03:59,338
Baby.

467
01:04:00,007 --> 01:04:01,127
Hey.

468
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:03,132
Are you okay?

469
01:04:07,472 --> 01:04:08,682
Lucy?

470
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:11,805
Mommy.

471
01:04:12,686 --> 01:04:14,846
You woke me up.

472
01:04:34,208 --> 01:04:35,708
Are you okay?

473
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:39,547
Yes.

474
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:43,167
Yes.

475
01:04:43,717 --> 01:04:45,757
Come on. I've got to get dry.

476
01:04:57,356 --> 01:04:59,396
I just think it would be
a really good idea.

477
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:02,736
I can't remember the last time
Lucy saw her cousins.

478
01:05:02,778 --> 01:05:03,738
I know.

479
01:05:03,779 --> 01:05:05,069
It would be amazing.

480
01:05:05,113 --> 01:05:06,913
I would love that.

481
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:10,736
I'm just not sure it's the best timing
for business, but...

482
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:14,210
You are always saying that
you never have any time to relax.

483
01:05:14,248 --> 01:05:17,248
You know, she's got a month
before she starts school...

484
01:05:17,876 --> 01:05:22,126
and we haven't been to the States
for so long.

485
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,152
Are you okay?

486
01:05:45,279 --> 01:05:47,279
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

487
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:49,948
Yeah? You seem kind of flushed.

488
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:53,447
I'm just coming down with something.
Luce!

489
01:05:55,080 --> 01:05:56,080
Luce?

490
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:57,213
Lucy?

491
01:05:57,249 --> 01:05:58,459
- Luce?
- Lucy?

492
01:05:59,793 --> 01:06:00,753
Lucy!

493
01:06:00,794 --> 01:06:02,034
I'll go look for her out front.

494
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:03,087
Luce?

495
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:04,130
Lucy?

496
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:07,588
Mommy!

497
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:08,644
Lucy!

498
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,470
Luce!

499
01:06:21,607 --> 01:06:22,607
Lucy!

500
01:06:23,567 --> 01:06:24,937
Luce!

501
01:06:32,075 --> 01:06:33,075
Lucy!

502
01:06:38,248 --> 01:06:39,248
Mommy!

503
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:46,756
Lucy!

504
01:07:28,048 --> 01:07:29,218
Maria!

505
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,550
Hey.

506
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:42,404
Michael! Where were you?

507
01:07:43,063 --> 01:07:46,153
She was just out front.
I tried to tell you, but you'd run off.

508
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:47,651
I couldn't find you.

509
01:08:56,762 --> 01:08:58,142
I know you're there.

510
01:10:08,208 --> 01:10:09,998
Oliver, stop it!

511
01:10:59,384 --> 01:11:00,384
Amma.

512
01:11:20,113 --> 01:11:21,113
Amma.

513
01:11:26,286 --> 01:11:27,616
Anushka?

514
01:12:38,692 --> 01:12:41,072
Look, Mommy. It's Oliver's book.

515
01:12:41,111 --> 01:12:42,111
Thank you.

516
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:55,376
What is this?

517
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:56,879
I'm not sure.

518
01:13:19,525 --> 01:13:21,285
Maria? Maria!

519
01:13:21,318 --> 01:13:22,108
Michael!

520
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:23,192
What?

521
01:13:23,237 --> 01:13:24,197
Lucy, come here.

522
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:25,158
Stay there.

523
01:13:25,197 --> 01:13:27,067
- I got you. It's okay.
- What is it, Mommy?

524
01:13:27,908 --> 01:13:29,078
It's okay.

525
01:14:19,209 --> 01:14:22,049
"And when the drawbridge closed
with a bang...

526
01:14:22,087 --> 01:14:24,707
"all the people were safe inside.

527
01:14:24,756 --> 01:14:28,386
"And deep in the dark forest
the dragon curled up in a heap...

528
01:14:28,427 --> 01:14:30,047
"and went to sleep."

529
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:34,637
I think you can curl up in a heap
and go to sleep now.

530
01:14:36,059 --> 01:14:41,649
You don't think that Oliver
did that to Piki, do you?

531
01:14:43,317 --> 01:14:44,567
No.

532
01:14:45,777 --> 01:14:50,487
No, I think what happened to Piki
was just a terrible, terrible accident.

533
01:14:50,824 --> 01:14:52,164
Are you sure?

534
01:14:53,076 --> 01:14:54,406
Yes, I am.

535
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:57,910
Now, how about you hop into bed?

536
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,250
Been a long day, little one.

537
01:15:06,924 --> 01:15:09,764
Can Winston sleep with me tonight?

538
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:12,682
I suppose that's a yes, isn't it?

539
01:15:14,097 --> 01:15:15,597
Do not hog all the bed.

540
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:17,853
Have sweet dreams. I love you.

541
01:15:20,145 --> 01:15:22,305
Is Piki in heaven now?

542
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:27,816
I think so, yes.

543
01:15:37,371 --> 01:15:39,791
Why isn't Oliver in heaven?

544
01:15:46,046 --> 01:15:47,956
It's time for bed, sweet girl.

545
01:15:48,507 --> 01:15:50,377
I'll see you in the morning.

546
01:17:08,545 --> 01:17:09,705
Lucy?

547
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:12,337
Baby, are you all right?

548
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:16,257
Luce?

549
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:22,475
Lucy.

550
01:17:26,438 --> 01:17:27,438
Lucy.

551
01:17:32,069 --> 01:17:33,069
Lucy?

552
01:17:34,196 --> 01:17:35,316
Luce!

553
01:17:36,573 --> 01:17:37,823
Lucy!

554
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:39,989
Lucy!

555
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:48,464
Lucy!

556
01:17:54,091 --> 01:17:55,381
Luce?

557
01:17:56,385 --> 01:17:57,765
Are you in here?

558
01:17:57,803 --> 01:17:59,513
Baby, are you hiding from...

559
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:01,015
No, no, no.

560
01:18:01,056 --> 01:18:02,716
No, no!

561
01:18:27,791 --> 01:18:28,921
Lucy?

562
01:18:31,461 --> 01:18:32,421
Luce.

563
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:35,882
Oh, my God, sweet girl. You scared me.

564
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:37,931
So much.

565
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:41,722
What are you doing out here, baby?

566
01:18:41,763 --> 01:18:44,023
I wanted to feel the wind on my skin.

567
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,267
It tickles.

568
01:18:46,810 --> 01:18:47,980
Okay.

569
01:18:48,687 --> 01:18:50,607
Okay, come on, let's go to bed.

570
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:01,834
Hey, guys. What's going on?

571
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:03,616
Daddy!

572
01:19:04,036 --> 01:19:05,076
Hey, you.

573
01:19:05,704 --> 01:19:07,874
What are you doing out here
so late, pumpkin?

574
01:19:07,915 --> 01:19:09,515
I think
she might have been sleepwalking.

575
01:19:12,294 --> 01:19:13,804
I missed you, Daddy.

576
01:19:16,548 --> 01:19:18,218
I missed you, too, sweetheart.

577
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:22,221
How about we get you back to bed?
Come on.

578
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:24,603
I love you, Daddy.

579
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:26,020
I love you, too...

580
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:27,600
What...

581
01:19:29,061 --> 01:19:30,021
What?

582
01:19:30,062 --> 01:19:31,192
- Michael.
- No, no, no.

583
01:19:32,856 --> 01:19:34,066
Michael.

584
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:36,693
No. No!

585
01:19:39,863 --> 01:19:41,033
Michael.

586
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:54,002
It's got to burn. It's got to burn.

587
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:56,634
What? Why?

588
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,010
Because Oliver came back.

589
01:20:03,554 --> 01:20:04,764
What?

590
01:20:05,013 --> 01:20:07,393
Oliver came back,
and I think he killed Piki.

591
01:20:07,432 --> 01:20:10,232
Because she tried to burn
all of his things to send him back...

592
01:20:10,269 --> 01:20:11,729
because he's not our boy anymore.

593
01:20:11,770 --> 01:20:13,060
Stop.

594
01:20:14,273 --> 01:20:15,483
Darling, stop.

595
01:20:15,524 --> 01:20:17,444
I know it sounds absolutely crazy,
but it's true.

596
01:20:17,818 --> 01:20:19,528
Right, Luce? Right?

597
01:20:20,988 --> 01:20:23,618
I don't know
what you're talking about, Mommy.

598
01:20:23,907 --> 01:20:26,327
No, no, baby, it's okay. It's okay.

599
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,738
We can tell Daddy now.

600
01:20:27,786 --> 01:20:29,786
Tell him about your brother.
Tell him about the piano.

601
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:31,460
Tell him about the piano.

602
01:20:32,457 --> 01:20:35,707
I don't know what you're saying.
Oliver's dead.

603
01:20:36,628 --> 01:20:39,258
Luce, I don't know why you're doing this
right now, okay?

604
01:20:39,298 --> 01:20:41,218
But you need to
tell your father the truth.

605
01:20:41,258 --> 01:20:42,678
You need to tell him.

606
01:20:43,135 --> 01:20:44,895
I don't know what you mean, Mommy.

607
01:20:44,928 --> 01:20:46,178
Lucy, you have to tell him!

608
01:20:46,221 --> 01:20:48,261
Enough! Enough!

609
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:51,520
You're scaring her.

610
01:20:52,686 --> 01:20:55,516
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but...

611
01:21:01,528 --> 01:21:02,818
It's all right.

612
01:21:02,863 --> 01:21:04,913
Let's get you to bed, sweetheart.

613
01:21:05,949 --> 01:21:07,119
All right.

614
01:21:09,745 --> 01:21:11,295
You feel better, poppet?

615
01:21:11,622 --> 01:21:13,292
Now that you're here, Daddy.

616
01:21:16,877 --> 01:21:19,247
You sleep well, okay? I love you.

617
01:21:19,296 --> 01:21:20,506
I love you, too.

618
01:21:20,547 --> 01:21:22,377
Lucy, please tell Daddy about Oliver.

619
01:21:23,634 --> 01:21:25,844
Maria, sweetheart,
you're not thinking straight.

620
01:21:25,886 --> 01:21:27,546
- Can we talk about this downstairs?
- I'm not making it up.

621
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:30,716
I understand you don't think
you're making it up, but I...

622
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:34,940
What?

623
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:39,822
Oliver, what have you done?

624
01:21:45,155 --> 01:21:46,195
Maria?

625
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,620
He's possessed her.

626
01:21:47,658 --> 01:21:49,198
Maria, would you listen to yourself?

627
01:21:49,243 --> 01:21:50,493
No, no, no!

628
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:52,788
Oliver?

629
01:21:54,831 --> 01:21:56,001
Maria.

630
01:21:56,291 --> 01:21:58,461
We can be together again.

631
01:21:58,502 --> 01:22:00,092
You leave your sister alone!

632
01:22:00,128 --> 01:22:01,548
Daddy, I'm scared!

633
01:22:01,588 --> 01:22:02,588
Stop!

634
01:22:07,803 --> 01:22:09,053
Come here, sweetheart.

635
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,466
It's going to be all right.

636
01:22:10,514 --> 01:22:11,814
Michael.

637
01:22:12,933 --> 01:22:14,143
You need help.

638
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:17,144
I'm going to get you the help you need,
and everything is going to be okay.

639
01:22:22,943 --> 01:22:25,493
Okay. Are you all right, sweetheart?

640
01:22:25,529 --> 01:22:26,819
Mommy was hurting me.

641
01:22:26,864 --> 01:22:29,124
No, no.
Mommy's just not herself right now.

642
01:22:29,157 --> 01:22:30,987
But she loves you very much.

643
01:22:31,368 --> 01:22:32,788
And so do I.

644
01:22:33,871 --> 01:22:35,291
Where are we going?

645
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:37,170
We're going on a little adventure.

646
01:22:49,636 --> 01:22:50,796
What do you want?

647
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:04,400
Okay.

648
01:23:07,863 --> 01:23:10,423
Just stay here. I'm going to make
a quick call, okay, sweetheart?

649
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,661
Everything's going to be fine.

650
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:15,201
Okay.

651
01:23:15,495 --> 01:23:16,575
Come on.

652
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:19,869
Come on.

653
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:41,267
Hello. Hi.

654
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:49,740
Yes, okay, my address is Dobra Villa,
satrah, Carter Road, in Bandra.

655
01:23:50,072 --> 01:23:52,822
Yes, there's a group of men
outside my house...

656
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:55,536
and I think they're trying to break in
and get my daughter...

657
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:57,759
I'm not sure,
but I need help immediately.

658
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:00,042
Bad dog.

659
01:24:00,874 --> 01:24:02,044
Yes. Yes.

660
01:24:02,376 --> 01:24:03,746
As fast as you can.

661
01:24:05,254 --> 01:24:06,504
Quiet.

662
01:24:06,547 --> 01:24:09,217
I don't know, but they're naked almost.

663
01:24:09,258 --> 01:24:10,758
Okay, please hurry. Yes.

664
01:24:14,888 --> 01:24:16,388
Lucy, what...

665
01:24:19,810 --> 01:24:21,480
Oh, my God. Baby.

666
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:24,610
What did you do?

667
01:24:25,732 --> 01:24:27,532
Winston was being naughty.

668
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:29,398
So I had to teach him a lesson.

669
01:24:31,780 --> 01:24:33,380
You're not going to be naughty
as well...

670
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:35,077
are you, Daddy?

671
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:37,159
No!

672
01:24:38,161 --> 01:24:40,411
It's just Mommy and me now.

673
01:24:50,257 --> 01:24:51,377
I'm sorry, Daddy.

674
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:53,595
I didn't mean to hurt you.

675
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,932
You're making a mess
all over the kitchen floor.

676
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:01,735
Mommy will be mad.

677
01:25:02,769 --> 01:25:05,229
Lucy, what are you doing?

678
01:25:05,731 --> 01:25:07,611
I'm not Lucy. I'm Oliver.

679
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:09,943
No.

680
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:11,777
But I am!

681
01:25:45,103 --> 01:25:46,193
Michael?

682
01:26:13,799 --> 01:26:14,839
Michael.

683
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:25,481
Michael?

684
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:43,367
Oliver!

685
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:52,748
Help me, Mommy!
Help me, Mommy!

686
01:26:53,046 --> 01:26:54,336
Leave her alone!

687
01:26:58,093 --> 01:26:59,183
Lucy!

688
01:26:59,219 --> 01:27:00,509
- Mommy.
- Lucy!

689
01:27:00,554 --> 01:27:01,554
Baby!

690
01:27:03,056 --> 01:27:04,056
Luce!

691
01:27:11,773 --> 01:27:12,773
Lucy!

692
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:44,969
No!

693
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:49,310
Lucy!

694
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:51,479
No!

695
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,403
Oliver, you leave Lucy
and you come to me.

696
01:27:57,986 --> 01:27:59,946
You come to me. Do you hear me?

697
01:27:59,988 --> 01:28:01,238
I don't want to go back.

698
01:28:01,281 --> 01:28:03,621
I know. I know. But I'll go with you.

699
01:28:04,284 --> 01:28:05,294
All right?

700
01:28:09,414 --> 01:28:14,424
You'll be safe. You're safe.
I've got you. I've got you.

701
01:28:25,597 --> 01:28:27,267
Take me instead.

702
01:28:28,308 --> 01:28:29,478
No!

703
01:28:32,145 --> 01:28:33,855
No! No!

704
01:28:34,314 --> 01:28:35,324
Maria!

705
01:28:36,817 --> 01:28:38,107
No!

706
01:28:38,986 --> 01:28:40,316
Let me go!

707
01:30:09,743 --> 01:30:10,793
No!

708
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:21,422
Mommy!

709
01:30:35,936 --> 01:30:36,976
Maria?

710
01:30:39,439 --> 01:30:40,729
Michael?

711
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:42,904
Maria, can you hear me?

712
01:30:43,777 --> 01:30:45,107
Michael, where are you?

713
01:30:45,821 --> 01:30:47,411
I'm right here, sweetheart.

714
01:30:48,574 --> 01:30:50,244
I can't believe I can hear your voice.

715
01:30:51,577 --> 01:30:52,657
Sweetheart?

716
01:30:54,329 --> 01:30:55,329
Maria?

717
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,250
Can you hear me?

718
01:31:00,961 --> 01:31:03,091
Darling, please, I need to see you.

719
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,590
- Michael?
- Please, where are you?

720
01:31:04,631 --> 01:31:06,591
- No.
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?

721
01:31:06,633 --> 01:31:07,593
No.

722
01:31:07,634 --> 01:31:08,894
- Please, I need to see you.
- Michael.

723
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:09,967
I need to see your face.

724
01:31:10,012 --> 01:31:11,102
No!

725
01:31:11,597 --> 01:31:12,637
No!
