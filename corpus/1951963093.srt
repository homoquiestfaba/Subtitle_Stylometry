00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:24,500
PRIVATE MUSEUM LAROUSSE

2
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,225
Hello baby.

3
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:10,100
I will bring to you the receipt that's why.

4
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:26,227
Come here.

5
00:04:47,468 --> 00:04:47,881
Thank you.

6
00:05:36,395 --> 00:05:37,071
It is me who is.

7
00:05:37,624 --> 00:05:39,339
If, say to him that I obtained it.

8
00:05:39,957 --> 00:05:40,323
You joke.

9
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:42,678
I want to return in the first plane.

10
00:05:42,713 --> 00:05:44,503
Believe me.

11
00:05:45,074 --> 00:05:45,436
Skylight.

12
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,158
We already know it.

13
00:06:06,976 --> 00:06:07,622
For what delay so much?

14
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:08,718
Relax darling.

15
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,609
The es a thief, I do not understand even
because you do not bring it.

16
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:16,848
The patience differentiates us
of the idiots.

17
00:06:16,883 --> 00:06:20,225
It is alone that me frusta, after all these
years I come to house.

18
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,071
To find the same happening.

19
00:06:22,106 --> 00:06:24,340
Our history is stolen.

20
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:25,313
Once again.

21
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:30,224
It is your destination returning to do
what is correct.

22
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,600
Someone comes closer.

23
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:51,331
Say to him that they should be kept silent.

24
00:08:14,255 --> 00:08:16,226
What so good surprise.

25
00:08:18,296 --> 00:08:19,456
What brings them somewhere here?

26
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:24,929
Desde que rebuscaba la ciudad y
las ruinas de Palmira.

27
00:08:27,235 --> 00:08:31,914
Ha provocado que sus excabaciones
han sido canceladas.

28
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,323
No creo que relamente quiera eso.

29
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,811
Tu tiempo aquí se acabó.

30
00:08:42,457 --> 00:08:46,188
Mi consejo es que empaque y
salga de la ciudad.

31
00:09:27,188 --> 00:09:28,591
Finalmente buenas noticias.

32
00:09:30,054 --> 00:09:31,947
Tenemos una rata.

33
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:34,802
Uno de los hombres debe haber
hablado.

34
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,028
Sellala.

35
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:41,695
No puede hacerlo.

36
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:43,184
Todos morirán.

37
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:44,550
Exactamente.

38
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:48,310
Te lo ruego, estos son mis
familiares.

39
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,747
Corran, corran.

40
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,213
Salgan, salgan.

41
00:09:56,685 --> 00:09:57,638
They want to seal the entry.

42
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:20,910
I list.

43
00:10:21,517 --> 00:10:21,908
Vámonos.

44
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,949
There the rat goes.

45
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:49,301
Say to him that we have something
in the night.

46
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,623
We go.

47
00:11:07,772 --> 00:11:14,858
Ugarit is one of the most prolific
and poderozas civilizations in the ground.

48
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:19,248
This metropolis had one
very advanced culture.

49
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:23,295
Producing the first alphabet.

50
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,542
Many years.

51
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:27,083
Ugarit was the best of half an east.

52
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:30,143
His success was not reached for
others.

53
00:11:32,032 --> 00:11:33,187
Teacher...

54
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,197
What is this thing that it has
supporting?

55
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,313
The está supporting something in his hand.

56
00:11:45,811 --> 00:11:46,935
They see this and this.

57
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:51,809
2 pieces the iris and the eye.

58
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,627
They compose a star of the sky.

59
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:57,459
When they join it was supposed
that a type of weapon was forming.

60
00:11:58,124 --> 00:12:00,346
Mythologically if they ask me.

61
00:12:00,381 --> 00:12:04,292
So the king him could not
to see the faces with this thing.

62
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,790
This way it is.

63
00:12:25,667 --> 00:12:26,140
If.

64
00:12:29,432 --> 00:12:31,176
Where are you?

65
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:32,602
Here.

66
00:12:34,107 --> 00:12:34,598
Hello.

67
00:12:36,671 --> 00:12:37,305
Welcome.

68
00:12:39,763 --> 00:12:40,357
How is life?

69
00:12:41,626 --> 00:12:42,103
Equal.

70
00:12:43,605 --> 00:12:46,193
Much obsecionado with
treasure.

71
00:12:46,228 --> 00:12:48,323
Worried by you
because he does not see you.

72
00:12:51,009 --> 00:12:52,861
But you do not worry
true?

73
00:12:52,896 --> 00:12:54,444
How was your trip?

74
00:12:54,479 --> 00:12:56,746
The Frenchmen have another reason
to hate the Americans.

75
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,428
And then in 1375.

76
00:13:02,933 --> 00:13:07,948
Ugarit derrepente desapaereció
completely.

77
00:13:08,531 --> 00:13:13,261
We believe that the city was plundered
for the Egyptian emperor.

78
00:13:13,296 --> 00:13:14,711
Amutep 4to.

79
00:13:15,775 --> 00:13:21,938
There are neither tracks, nor cultural treasures
or the star of the sky.

80
00:13:21,973 --> 00:13:24,102
That had been found for
the Syrians or the egiptos.

81
00:13:25,422 --> 00:13:27,423
Then: what happened?

82
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:31,570
I believe that the survivor of Himotep
4to.

83
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:35,169
They kept something of the treasure, hiding it.

84
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:41,743
also I believe that the location of the treasure
it is codified.

85
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:46,593
That will appear in the time, and
left behind so that we find it.

86
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:53,754
Our university is writing
an article arqueológio egipto.

87
00:13:53,789 --> 00:13:57,517
Under the supervición of the Dr.
Lena Halstrom.

88
00:13:57,552 --> 00:14:02,932
We believe that it departs from the treasure
of Ugarit it is very similar.

89
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:11,563
I have an entraga of pizza for
a teacher Frederick.

90
00:14:11,598 --> 00:14:13,239
This is quite per today.

91
00:14:13,915 --> 00:14:17,416
Our arguments of archaeology
there is something serious to that I have to attend.

92
00:14:17,451 --> 00:14:18,475
They can go away.

93
00:14:20,882 --> 00:14:22,164
How did the photos go out?

94
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:24,550
Well.

95
00:14:25,312 --> 00:14:27,272
This key is not known very much.

96
00:14:28,223 --> 00:14:29,173
What is there of the marks?

97
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:30,672
It is like something.

98
00:14:31,296 --> 00:14:33,882
It is something religious on Ilu.

99
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:35,573
Order him the photos.

100
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,485
We need his review.

101
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,914
I go in way.

102
00:14:38,949 --> 00:14:40,928
Frederick listens, this is not...

103
00:14:45,849 --> 00:14:46,546
It makes me happy that you will return.

104
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,877
Ali, yes that happened in Damascus.

105
00:14:49,912 --> 00:14:51,105
But we have photos.

106
00:14:53,103 --> 00:14:55,245
Ali wants to see that there is in
table.

107
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,531
Did you order him the photos?

108
00:14:57,119 --> 00:14:58,081
Pleasure of meeting.

109
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,130
I feel it.

110
00:14:59,404 --> 00:15:00,242
That good to meet.

111
00:15:01,321 --> 00:15:02,777
Now where they are...

112
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,059
My god you stole the table.

113
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:10,882
Stealing is a very ugly word.

114
00:15:12,107 --> 00:15:14,055
The appropriate thing would be, in the name
of the science.

115
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:16,283
I cannot believe that you should bring
quite.

116
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:18,595
I said to you that only you should take a photo.

117
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,620
Forget it I do not want to know it.

118
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:27,570
I spent most of my life looking
to have it in my hands.

119
00:15:30,421 --> 00:15:31,001
Thank you.

120
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:37,160
Time the marks right here?

121
00:15:38,351 --> 00:15:40,972
They say all that in the past
you have to return.

122
00:15:41,007 --> 00:15:42,051
That schemer.

123
00:15:44,555 --> 00:15:47,343
Key between them.

124
00:15:48,262 --> 00:15:50,559
A light of the sky descended.

125
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:53,881
This is a common form
of describing one to share.

126
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:57,867
And his glory was hidden.

127
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:00,138
In the doors of the mouth.

128
00:16:00,866 --> 00:16:05,944
Between the doors of the Shadis
empty eyes.

129
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:10,131
Until his name is remembered.

130
00:16:11,124 --> 00:16:12,620
Once again.

131
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:15,890
Certainly, that great felt tien.

132
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,776
Jack seriousness.

133
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:21,388
A table is alone, not
it means nothing.

134
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:23,291
Alone sound bullshit.

135
00:16:23,897 --> 00:16:25,437
It is much more than that.

136
00:16:26,655 --> 00:16:29,054
How many things how are you are there
do I dress?

137
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:33,696
If one in thousand says something, this
it is not.

138
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:38,571
These illusions perhaps are
graphic marks for the location

139
00:16:38,606 --> 00:16:39,795
of the treasure.

140
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:43,373
If he says that, I am exausto me
I go.

141
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,771
Tomorrow we go away and insure
of this time brings quite.

142
00:16:48,435 --> 00:16:48,829
I feel it.

143
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,185
To Syria, we go away to Syria.

144
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:53,127
Not, I am not going to go.

145
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:54,975
You can go.

146
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,886
This is your life.

147
00:16:55,921 --> 00:16:58,042
I have my life, have things
that to do.

148
00:16:58,605 --> 00:16:59,679
Yes, I know it.

149
00:17:00,879 --> 00:17:01,838
Not empiezes denuevo.

150
00:17:01,873 --> 00:17:02,817
I did for what you asked me.

151
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:03,853
I have a flight that to take.

152
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:04,782
I go away tomorrow in the morning
to Florida.

153
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,808
I cannot believe that at least
do not cause to you curiosity.

154
00:17:07,843 --> 00:17:09,944
We find the track.

155
00:17:09,979 --> 00:17:13,312
I have curiosity, but I do not have
time to walk along the desert.

156
00:17:13,347 --> 00:17:15,308
Because I have curiosity on
a stone.

157
00:17:15,343 --> 00:17:17,219
This is something real.

158
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:21,350
I want to find the treasure so much
as you.

159
00:17:21,891 --> 00:17:23,369
It is located in these phrases.

160
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:25,444
I am sure.

161
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,330
Only we need decifrar
the puzzle.

162
00:17:27,897 --> 00:17:31,786
Jack you are the only man in
ground that knows the language of Ugarit.

163
00:17:31,821 --> 00:17:32,924
To part of me.

164
00:17:32,959 --> 00:17:34,907
If deciframos the map.

165
00:17:34,942 --> 00:17:36,960
We will find the treasure.

166
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:39,919
And to return personally this
to the persons of Syria.

167
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:41,606
It is not a map.

168
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:42,763
It is not a map.

169
00:17:43,197 --> 00:17:45,164
I know that it is not easy for
you.

170
00:17:47,685 --> 00:17:52,355
But our work is more important
for the humanity that you and your pockets.

171
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:54,400
How cannot you learn anything
of the past?

172
00:17:54,435 --> 00:17:55,711
Forgive me teacher.

173
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:58,333
Forgive for interrupting but...

174
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:00,520
It is late, if it does not matter for him I want
to go to house.

175
00:18:01,836 --> 00:18:03,229
If darling go to house.

176
00:18:03,663 --> 00:18:06,024
Tomorrow we must prepare oneself
for my trip to Syria.

177
00:18:07,721 --> 00:18:09,034
Jack would matter for you to accompany oneself
to house.

178
00:18:10,352 --> 00:18:11,996
Skylight.

179
00:18:13,396 --> 00:18:14,924
Already me hiba anyhow.

180
00:18:14,959 --> 00:18:17,431
We are closer than never Jack
please.

181
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:19,714
Come with me.

182
00:18:38,603 --> 00:18:40,383
Thanks for doing this.

183
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:47,279
The 2 can look after because
they do not stop fighting.

184
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:50,576
The fact is that it is trying to turn me
in something that I am not.

185
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:52,491
And what is that exactamante?

186
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:00,046
I am Jack Hunter.

187
00:19:26,372 --> 00:19:26,981
He waits, hopes.

188
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:34,414
I cannot do this.

189
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:41,005
Without tie.

190
00:19:45,212 --> 00:19:46,883
Someone says that hidden it is better.

191
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,588
Moving the next one
adventure of Jack Hunter.

192
00:19:51,669 --> 00:19:52,498
I feel it ok.

193
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:58,266
Federick has something that at least
you can do.

194
00:19:58,301 --> 00:20:04,604
I hope that you should spend it.

195
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:05,374
It is of that thing about what was talking each other.

196
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:06,554
The conversation.

197
00:20:06,589 --> 00:20:08,423
Sometimes you are an idiot.

198
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,422
Only sometimes?

199
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:10,754
You or Frederick.

200
00:20:14,918 --> 00:20:15,833
I see you then.

201
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:37,995
This is.

202
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:46,991
Who are you?

203
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,504
Frederick, only wanted to say
that I feel.

204
00:21:18,887 --> 00:21:19,866
Not, please God not.

205
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:21,374
Federick.

206
00:22:28,266 --> 00:22:29,654
I have your visa, your tiquet.

207
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:31,837
Actualizé your software.

208
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:34,245
And with this phone you will have
access.

209
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,231
How is it that they have the money for
to obtain all this?

210
00:22:39,839 --> 00:22:41,278
It is a part of the investigation.

211
00:22:47,984 --> 00:22:51,522
Sight I do not know that to say, this
it must be very painful.

212
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,385
What I said yesterday evening.

213
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,636
I know that there is no thing for which
have to do this.

214
00:23:05,987 --> 00:23:06,907
Yes it is.

215
00:23:09,202 --> 00:23:10,567
Please, this was a theft.

216
00:23:10,602 --> 00:23:12,193
Because you do not leave that they
take charge.

217
00:23:12,228 --> 00:23:13,395
The table disappeared.

218
00:23:14,622 --> 00:23:17,817
The table disappeared
and only there is a person that it was known

219
00:23:17,852 --> 00:23:19,271
that we had it.

220
00:23:20,658 --> 00:23:21,182
Ali.

221
00:23:21,667 --> 00:23:22,998
The fue the one that killed it.

222
00:23:24,381 --> 00:23:24,897
Without being any valiso.

223
00:23:24,932 --> 00:23:26,148
Since it is I will begin with him.

224
00:23:32,743 --> 00:23:35,784
Frederick had wanted that you have
this.

225
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:44,757
Thank you.

226
00:23:48,835 --> 00:23:51,491
I will need something rapid when
come there.

227
00:23:53,007 --> 00:23:54,190
You know that you are the only one in whom
I trust.

228
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,156
Enjoy his demurrage.

229
00:24:40,459 --> 00:24:41,340
Mr. Jack.

230
00:24:42,718 --> 00:24:43,200
Yes.

231
00:24:43,611 --> 00:24:44,073
Wonderful.

232
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:44,962
Finally.

233
00:24:46,858 --> 00:24:49,034
The department of tourism authorized that
he was assisting it.

234
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,167
The department of tourism?

235
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,075
I thought that it was of the department.

236
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,367
Or, arquelogía.

237
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:55,305
She is waiting there.

238
00:24:55,855 --> 00:24:57,581
His name is Nadja Ramadan.

239
00:25:00,326 --> 00:25:00,924
Nadja

240
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:03,378
His Jeep is going out.

241
00:25:03,413 --> 00:25:06,154
Allow me to see the reviews and me
I will entrust of his baggage.

242
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:09,220

I am his man in Syria.

244
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:11,979
Everything what he needs.

245
00:25:12,014 --> 00:25:13,963
In the daytime or at night, be when me
need.

246
00:25:13,998 --> 00:25:15,224
I never durmo.

247
00:25:15,259 --> 00:25:16,637
When it is, which is.

248
00:25:17,359 --> 00:25:17,842
I understand it.

249
00:25:18,646 --> 00:25:19,261
Thank you.

250
00:25:19,296 --> 00:25:20,339
I will bring his things.

251
00:25:24,371 --> 00:25:24,918
Hello.

252
00:25:24,953 --> 00:25:26,964

254
00:25:31,774 --> 00:25:32,801
I am Nadia Ramadan.

255
00:25:32,836 --> 00:25:35,965
It was working with doctor Alice,
manager of archaeology.

256
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,789
It is american.

257
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:41,465
She was not educated there, but I was born here
in Syria.

258
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:44,701
The last one looks for the teacher
time that was here.

259
00:25:45,688 --> 00:25:48,461
He was speaking very well about you it is
a very good man.

260
00:25:48,496 --> 00:25:50,137
My deepest condolences.

261
00:25:50,172 --> 00:25:51,476
Thank you.

262
00:25:52,621 --> 00:25:54,040
And where Ali is?

263
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:57,826
The tiene personal things that
antender.

264
00:25:57,861 --> 00:25:58,831
We will see it tomorrow.

265
00:25:58,866 --> 00:26:00,597
Good we will see if I see it
before that.

266
00:26:03,631 --> 00:26:06,145
Allow me to say to him as it is that
this will continue.

267
00:26:07,465 --> 00:26:11,316
Ali asked me to assist it but
I do it protesting.

268
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:13,968
I have doubts for whom you or
that it does.

269
00:26:14,003 --> 00:26:16,104
Now, I will lead it to eating.

270
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,689
Tomorrow and up to that, it will not separate
of my sight.

271
00:26:19,724 --> 00:26:23,490
If he tries to evade me or of take some
appliance of my ground.

272
00:26:23,525 --> 00:26:25,771
I will do a call and only one.

273
00:26:25,806 --> 00:26:28,492
To the army of Syria.

274
00:26:28,527 --> 00:26:31,336
They will insure themselves to that never
more see the light of the day again.

275
00:26:31,371 --> 00:26:32,651
Am I an egg white?

276
00:26:33,674 --> 00:26:34,360
Crystalline.

277
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:37,389
Allow me to say something to him.

278
00:26:38,156 --> 00:26:39,909
I am here to finish the work of
teacher Frederick.

279
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:43,350
That will be the way of the work.

280
00:26:43,385 --> 00:26:44,393
I do not know who is.

281
00:26:44,428 --> 00:26:47,056
and so that he knows, I do not want to know it.

282
00:26:47,091 --> 00:26:49,063
So while more rapid I took
with Ali.

283
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:51,172
This way of rapid we will separate.

284
00:26:51,973 --> 00:26:52,660
What seems to him?

285
00:26:54,372 --> 00:26:56,000
It seems that we understand each other.

286
00:26:56,969 --> 00:26:57,538
Skylight.

287
00:26:58,008 --> 00:26:59,635
Welcome to Syria Mr. Hunter.

288
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:00,478
Thank you.

289
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,917
What do you have here?
will you remain for one year?

290
00:27:11,976 --> 00:27:14,543
I will only remain so much like
be needed to end

291
00:27:14,578 --> 00:27:15,349
my business.

292
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:16,906
Good, it will love my country.

293
00:27:18,123 --> 00:27:19,529
I am not here for the love.

294
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:21,908
I am a good driver not
it worries.

295
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:23,721
I like precuparme.

296
00:27:23,756 --> 00:27:26,295
I did arrangements for the hotel.

297
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:28,379
It will be very comfortable.

298
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:31,749
You can take it there please.

299
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:34,836
I believe that Ali is dajado a little
for Mr.

300
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:39,657
It is a wonderful place.

301
00:27:40,432 --> 00:27:41,912
There are wonderful shops.

302
00:27:44,443 --> 00:27:46,218
We will listen to some music.

303
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:18,336
It is musical has to be
sounding?

304
00:28:42,566 --> 00:28:43,654
Since it can see it is beautiful.

305
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,440
Everything what he wishes is possible
to obtain here.

306
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,242
Go there is not...

307
00:28:48,818 --> 00:28:49,324
I will be well.

308
00:28:50,768 --> 00:28:54,323
I find it here, in 20 minutes,
I come for you.

309
00:28:55,686 --> 00:28:56,135
See you later.

310
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:13,644
Almost we come.

311
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:15,837
Call me Jack.

312
00:29:17,782 --> 00:29:19,454
I am sure that they owe it
of calling of a lot of forms.

313
00:29:19,489 --> 00:29:20,431
Pero Jack will be.

314
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,362
Hakim are you here?

315
00:29:35,975 --> 00:29:37,684
Nadja, welcome.

316
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:45,405
This Hakim is a friend.

317
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,590
It is an honor to know it Mr.

318
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,469
Equally.

319
00:29:48,504 --> 00:29:50,819
I believe that Ali left something for me.

320
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:52,593
Hope that a moment I go
to bringing it.

321
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:05,615
How does it him go?

322
00:30:06,615 --> 00:30:08,545
The Syrians are very friendly.

323
00:30:09,513 --> 00:30:10,237
Relax.

324
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,706
I feel it very much from what I listened
of the teacher.

325
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:18,900
He was a good and kind man.

326
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:20,801
Yes.

327
00:30:32,089 --> 00:30:32,689
Step back.

328
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,755
It is not the first time that I fight
with someone with sword.

329
00:30:40,961 --> 00:30:41,739
But that one is a little big.

330
00:31:06,606 --> 00:31:07,288
You have the roll.

331
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:07,957
Yes.

332
00:31:07,992 --> 00:31:08,664
Vámonos.

333
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:09,599
If.

334
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,630
Somewhere here.

335
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:24,452
Here.

336
00:31:26,646 --> 00:31:27,925
Go out of the way.

337
00:31:30,106 --> 00:31:30,970
Where?

338
00:31:59,759 --> 00:32:00,489
We go let's rise.

339
00:32:00,524 --> 00:32:01,152
For the stairs.

340
00:32:27,717 --> 00:32:30,295
Well, we go.

341
00:32:32,101 --> 00:32:32,511
We go.

342
00:32:49,474 --> 00:32:49,749
Somewhere here.

343
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:50,866
We go.

344
00:33:05,512 --> 00:33:05,966
Somewhere here.

345
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:06,695
We go.

346
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:10,068
It runs.

347
00:33:33,268 --> 00:33:33,940
We have to jump.

348
00:33:33,975 --> 00:33:34,813
What?

349
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:35,676
To jump.

350
00:33:48,135 --> 00:33:48,946
He enjoys your wedding.

351
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:49,682
You beautiful time.

352
00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:54,283
Somewhere here.

353
00:34:00,305 --> 00:34:01,058
We go rapidly.

354
00:34:01,517 --> 00:34:01,922
Ok.

355
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:04,975
We go.

356
00:34:16,623 --> 00:34:17,891
What step backwards?

357
00:34:17,926 --> 00:34:19,796
They tried to steal us.

358
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:20,386
Not.

359
00:34:20,421 --> 00:34:21,711
Yes.

360
00:34:24,175 --> 00:34:26,996
What are you doing?

361
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:27,974
Not.

362
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:29,420
Why not?

363
00:34:29,455 --> 00:34:31,066
They will find to
villains.

364
00:34:31,101 --> 00:34:32,943
They will only extract us of the way and
we will not have time.

365
00:34:32,978 --> 00:34:34,775
I have trouble in being with
Ali.

366
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,323
Someone must have the authority
adapted.

367
00:34:36,358 --> 00:34:37,705
They can.

368
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,932
He did not trust in anybody now.

369
00:34:38,967 --> 00:34:39,871
That is not like that.

370
00:34:39,906 --> 00:34:40,708
Now you have sense.

371
00:34:40,743 --> 00:34:45,309
Do they want to know that it is what I think?

372
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:47,629
Not.

373
00:34:47,664 --> 00:34:49,879
I believe that they all need to calm down.

374
00:34:49,914 --> 00:34:51,492
There is no need to get angry.

375
00:34:51,527 --> 00:34:52,551
Let's go to the hotel...

376
00:34:52,586 --> 00:34:53,467
Only he drives.

377
00:34:54,105 --> 00:34:54,527
Ok.

378
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:02,382
The bad thing is that there is always someone
following to where you should go.

379
00:35:02,417 --> 00:35:04,871
Listen to me, Fedrerik was murdered
for this Table.

380
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:08,985
What table?

381
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:09,858
What is all that?

382
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:12,858
About what they were asking themselves of
photos of Ali.

383
00:35:12,893 --> 00:35:19,210
That's why.

384
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:20,774
It did not show it to you.

385
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:21,806
Not.

386
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:22,640
It did not show it to me.

387
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,121
With the time the confiaba
in nobody.

388
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:27,900
The pensaba that it was a type
of map.

389
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:30,391
Allow me to say something to yourself.

390
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:31,791
I go to come to the fund of this.

391
00:35:31,826 --> 00:35:32,897
That I promise it to you.

392
00:35:34,612 --> 00:35:35,669
Can you drive more rapid?

393
00:35:36,365 --> 00:35:37,570
I am driving.

394
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:08,369
If, it is activated.

395
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:09,573
I have to hang, they call me.

396
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:12,851
Listen to me.

397
00:36:13,451 --> 00:36:14,653
Hello: how does it go quite?

398
00:36:15,144 --> 00:36:16,598
Simply well.

399
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,053
Seriously it is a wonderful place.

400
00:36:18,088 --> 00:36:20,202
He listens, I went to the shop of Ali.

401
00:36:20,237 --> 00:36:26,732
It was not there but it left me
a drawing.

402
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,947
I believe that it is a type of map
Egyptian.

403
00:36:28,982 --> 00:36:31,541
I need that you order it to the south of Syria.

404
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:34,327
Can you order it to me?

405
00:36:35,802 --> 00:36:37,504
If, there is no problem.

406
00:36:39,929 --> 00:36:40,828
It goes already.

407
00:36:42,962 --> 00:36:43,912
It comes to you now.

408
00:36:52,403 --> 00:36:55,412
Good, if you need something more
make it know me ok.

409
00:36:55,447 --> 00:36:56,233
Thank you.

410
00:36:56,268 --> 00:36:57,366
You keep it sure.

411
00:37:01,833 --> 00:37:02,541
Hello.

412
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,729
Only give me a second, I have that
to dress myself.

413
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:06,011
We go it happens.

414
00:37:15,625 --> 00:37:18,064
And the police officers found
to that types?

415
00:37:18,922 --> 00:37:23,567
The report was filed
it is an alone time for...

416
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,684
It is a map.

417
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:33,315
I know it.

418
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:42,360
Let's see.

419
00:37:43,425 --> 00:37:45,253
Do you know any place where to eat?

420
00:37:46,695 --> 00:37:49,557
I have some things in the computer
that wanted to show you.

421
00:38:06,689 --> 00:38:08,963
These are the photos that he was saying to you
on Ali.

422
00:38:11,942 --> 00:38:14,571
The symbols are definitively
Ugaricos.

423
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,135
Only it left this note.

424
00:38:20,092 --> 00:38:22,081
I feel it for not being available
to give you this personally.

425
00:38:23,102 --> 00:38:26,548
The same marks are in the photo
of the table that you ordered me and

426
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:28,547
also this map.

427
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:29,492
Recently I discovered.

428
00:38:29,527 --> 00:38:31,421
I believe that I can find
the place of the treasure.

429
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:32,864
I find you in Rashama.

430
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,827
We can compare notes.

431
00:38:37,386 --> 00:38:38,605
I do not know as it is this firstly.

432
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,626
Then scan the map in me
laptop and I put on top the images

433
00:38:41,661 --> 00:38:43,822
in 3 dimensions of the satellite.

434
00:38:43,857 --> 00:38:45,761
What I believe is that it is the same area.

435
00:38:45,796 --> 00:38:48,594
But that is under the water.

436
00:38:49,573 --> 00:38:53,120
This was constructed in 1973 and already
it was.

437
00:38:57,523 --> 00:38:58,784
He listens, has no sense.

438
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:01,881
Because what I realize the fact is that
the treasure perhaps is not in the lake.

439
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:06,743
Your chief has many questions that
to answer.

440
00:39:07,749 --> 00:39:09,106
When were you used?

441
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:11,856
I am another only person that
he knew of this.

442
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:12,821
And?

443
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,492
Now Frederik is dead.

444
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:21,446
I meet Ali all my life and
the mataría to nobody.

445
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:22,797
Nisiquiera to you.

446
00:39:24,595 --> 00:39:26,341
The man did not show you the photos
that I ordered him in photocopy.

447
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:30,170
That gave to me, clearly
it is a farce.

448
00:39:30,205 --> 00:39:31,266
This did not show you.

449
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:32,398
And us atacarón.

450
00:39:32,433 --> 00:39:35,066
If you were in me shoes.
What would you think?

451
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:36,299
You do not want to know that I am
thinking.

452
00:39:36,334 --> 00:39:37,610
Insurance that yes.

453
00:39:39,217 --> 00:39:40,097
You know already.

454
00:39:40,132 --> 00:39:42,061
Exquisite as always.

455
00:39:45,797 --> 00:39:46,742
Jack.

456
00:39:47,234 --> 00:39:48,470
Jack Hunter.

457
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:49,899
Hello Albert.

458
00:39:50,794 --> 00:39:52,527
It is interesting to see you here.

459
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:54,396
But because I am not surprised

460
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:56,309
They know each other.

461
00:39:59,888 --> 00:40:02,302
Why am not I surprised?

462
00:40:02,337 --> 00:40:05,565
Jack and I have the same philosophy
on the business.

463
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,166
Skylight that yes.

464
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:09,918
And you it is an excellent guide.

465
00:40:09,953 --> 00:40:13,241
On having protected the treasures
of the country.

466
00:40:14,451 --> 00:40:16,648
It is something good.

467
00:40:16,683 --> 00:40:18,974
The real one professional.

468
00:40:19,009 --> 00:40:21,521
And what is what it brings to this one
part of the world Jack?

469
00:40:21,556 --> 00:40:23,671
I like the meal.

470
00:40:23,706 --> 00:40:25,727
You are that you continue the steps
of Frederik?

471
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:28,797
The teacher recently
he has died.

472
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:30,081
Not.

473
00:40:30,825 --> 00:40:33,026
The murdered fue.

474
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:35,969
Oh, these are bad news.

475
00:40:36,004 --> 00:40:38,461
My deepest condolences
Jack.

476
00:40:38,496 --> 00:40:41,824
Now you are here to deal
of his magazine.

477
00:40:44,186 --> 00:40:47,198
Good I have to go away but
I am sure that we will turn out to be prompt.

478
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:48,835
Ok.

479
00:40:54,342 --> 00:40:55,800
I despise this man.

480
00:40:55,835 --> 00:40:59,231
Ali has always wanted to stop it
and now I believe that it got with

481
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:00,599
the Russian mafia.

482
00:41:01,647 --> 00:41:03,784
The money has done that they have
connections in the whole government.

483
00:41:07,555 --> 00:41:09,319
The last time that I checked to
Russian mafia only there were 3 thing.

484
00:41:10,305 --> 00:41:11,721
Contrabado, drugs and women.

485
00:41:13,582 --> 00:41:17,207
Then because they are interested
in the Syrian antiquities.

486
00:41:37,631 --> 00:41:40,471
I spent most of my life
looking because of it.

487
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:45,398
It is the call, it does not point at anything.

488
00:41:45,433 --> 00:41:48,205
It is only a trick.

489
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:57,039
If desiframos the map, we will find
the treasure.

490
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:01,310
Frederik this is your life, it is not mine.

491
00:42:01,345 --> 00:42:02,943
I have things that to do.

492
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,313
Come with me.

493
00:42:08,348 --> 00:42:09,596
Please.

494
00:43:22,314 --> 00:43:22,913
Are you well?

495
00:43:28,915 --> 00:43:31,386
What is happening?

496
00:43:41,015 --> 00:43:42,444
What devils did it happen here?

497
00:43:42,479 --> 00:43:44,710
Oh, already you know only your friend
it came to give us his service.

498
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,133
What are you doing?

499
00:43:51,168 --> 00:43:52,421
They are treating about that he thinks
that this map is something.

500
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:55,908
He must think that it is one
track for the treasure.

501
00:43:55,943 --> 00:43:57,142
I will not wait up to tomorrow,
I am going to see it now.

502
00:43:57,177 --> 00:43:59,670
Jack that has no sense.

503
00:43:59,705 --> 00:44:02,921
You believe that Ali gave you a map
false and now it is in charge persons

504
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:03,596
to steal it from you.

505
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:05,247
Do not you understand?

506
00:44:05,282 --> 00:44:06,336
Why did not it show you the email?

507
00:44:08,049 --> 00:44:10,494
Because if the treasure is real
everything wants it for yes.

508
00:44:11,303 --> 00:44:14,230
In my country, there is honor,
allegiance and that.

509
00:44:14,265 --> 00:44:18,019
Ali exemplifies all these qualities.

510
00:44:18,054 --> 00:44:19,774
When we met
you saw it.

511
00:44:19,809 --> 00:44:22,649
I continued listening to everything.

512
00:44:22,684 --> 00:44:23,688
And we had to see it.

513
00:44:23,723 --> 00:44:24,548
Aquién do you call?

514
00:44:26,756 --> 00:44:27,098
Tarique.

515
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:28,086
Enlist to come.

516
00:45:10,642 --> 00:45:12,250
I it is you who pay load it.

517
00:46:05,996 --> 00:46:06,520
What happened?

518
00:46:09,286 --> 00:46:10,812
What pasá, why are you crying?

519
00:46:13,434 --> 00:46:14,393
Ali is dead.

520
00:46:15,345 --> 00:46:15,962
What?

521
00:46:17,005 --> 00:46:18,749
Ali had an accident of car.

522
00:46:21,042 --> 00:46:22,983
His car dispersed
and he died.

523
00:46:35,598 --> 00:46:37,252
I suppose that you do not have to worry
for him.

524
00:46:37,738 --> 00:46:38,486
Damned.

525
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:40,794
The fue a big man.

526
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:43,593
A big man.
- I feel it.

527
00:46:44,089 --> 00:46:44,637
And you.

528
00:46:45,076 --> 00:46:45,471
I feel it.

529
00:46:45,506 --> 00:46:46,601
It was not an accident.

530
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:49,582
You listen to me, it was not an accident.

531
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:54,357
Ali, Frederik both were murdered
for the same reasons.

532
00:46:54,392 --> 00:46:55,071
The treasure.

533
00:46:57,375 --> 00:46:58,440
Someone thinks that it is real.

534
00:46:59,623 --> 00:47:01,074
Do not we go after?

535
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:01,863
Not.

536
00:47:01,898 --> 00:47:05,133
Irémos to house, we will return to
Damascus.

537
00:47:05,168 --> 00:47:05,691
Not.

538
00:47:05,726 --> 00:47:07,430
We will not return.

539
00:47:07,465 --> 00:47:08,729
I go to veriguar the one who killed to
Frederik.

540
00:47:10,568 --> 00:47:11,746
Do you want to know who killed Ali?

541
00:47:13,236 --> 00:47:14,050
Do you want?

542
00:47:17,523 --> 00:47:19,727
The only way of doing that,
it is looking at this.

543
00:47:20,932 --> 00:47:22,009
This is what we have left.

544
00:47:27,324 --> 00:47:28,506
What is that?

545
00:47:29,207 --> 00:47:29,624
It is a map.

546
00:47:31,102 --> 00:47:32,479
Frederik extracted it of
translation of the table.

547
00:47:33,274 --> 00:47:35,593
It is incomplete but us
it can teach where to begin.

548
00:47:35,628 --> 00:47:37,583
These are the mountains they are in
way of the desert.

549
00:47:38,475 --> 00:47:39,663
There is nothing there.

550
00:47:44,058 --> 00:47:45,848
This looks like a good place
to hide a treasure.

551
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:46,987
Do not believe it?

552
00:47:52,352 --> 00:47:54,288
First we go to the department
and we say to them.

553
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:56,818
Not, we cannot.
We do not have sufficient evidence.

554
00:47:56,853 --> 00:47:59,858
The one who finds it made will cover it
and it will never be known.

555
00:48:02,083 --> 00:48:03,611
Nobody will know it.

556
00:48:07,407 --> 00:48:08,115
Well.

557
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:11,106
We will do this to your way
for the time being.

558
00:48:14,046 --> 00:48:16,695
He would wish you to never come
here Jack

559
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:21,151
We are already 2.

560
00:48:33,453 --> 00:48:34,512
You are driving well.

561
00:48:34,547 --> 00:48:35,610
Do not you want that he drives?

562
00:48:35,645 --> 00:48:39,092
Not Mr. this is what I do
that's why I am here.

563
00:48:39,127 --> 00:48:40,970
I never sleep.

564
00:48:55,004 --> 00:48:57,117
Very much of: This is what I do
that's why I am here.

565
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,650
What devils?

566
00:49:17,121 --> 00:49:17,677
Hold.

567
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:27,188
Who are devils these guys?

568
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:29,929
How can I know it?

569
00:49:34,274 --> 00:49:34,665
We go.

570
00:49:40,971 --> 00:49:41,487
Elegant Jack.

571
00:50:10,322 --> 00:50:10,907
Hold.

572
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:25,270
I believe that we lost them.

573
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:41,724
I had the worst nightmare.

574
00:50:42,151 --> 00:50:43,095
We were...

575
00:50:43,483 --> 00:50:45,207
What bundles do we return and
let's go.

576
00:50:45,242 --> 00:50:48,034
It does not dress the persons that
were they shooting us behind?

577
00:50:48,069 --> 00:50:49,174
The same nightmare?

578
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:51,173
Relax.

579
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:52,595
Only allow me to think.

580
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:55,388
Antennas of phone.

581
00:50:57,434 --> 00:50:59,224
Perhaps be our connection to the car
track.

582
00:50:59,259 --> 00:51:01,111
you remain in the Jeep.

583
00:51:01,146 --> 00:51:03,047
Yes, yes good idea.

584
00:51:08,334 --> 00:51:09,434
We go somewhere here.

585
00:51:15,349 --> 00:51:16,704
Only we have to continue.

586
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:18,432
This way it is as it ends.

587
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,008
Only allow me to look.

588
00:51:22,736 --> 00:51:25,100
Why the American men
are they so punzantes?

589
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:29,442
We are not final we are
determinants.

590
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:30,265
If skylight.

591
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,471
There is nothing there.

592
00:51:31,506 --> 00:51:33,105
You know bundles my life...

593
00:51:34,305 --> 00:51:34,928
It returns to the Jeep.

594
00:51:37,142 --> 00:51:38,681
Nadja returns to the Jeep!

595
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:39,698
Why do you shout me?

596
00:51:48,637 --> 00:51:50,292
It lights the jeep.

597
00:51:52,173 --> 00:51:52,741
It lights the jeep.

598
00:51:57,786 --> 00:51:58,978
It enters, enters.

599
00:52:01,705 --> 00:52:02,342
To where do we go?

600
00:52:02,758 --> 00:52:03,283
Only drive!

601
00:52:19,331 --> 00:52:20,074
us atoramos.

602
00:52:20,109 --> 00:52:21,169
If, I know it.

603
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:22,147
We go, let's go out.

604
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:27,808
I need to call.

605
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:28,990
It brings my purse.

606
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:34,128
Stoop.

607
00:52:34,163 --> 00:52:43,642
Take it, take it.

608
00:52:45,282 --> 00:52:46,641
Can you use like this?

609
00:52:48,066 --> 00:52:48,572
I do not know.

610
00:52:49,946 --> 00:52:50,452
Give me that.

611
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:53,599
I will go to bring help.

612
00:52:54,286 --> 00:52:54,717
Waiting.

613
00:53:00,893 --> 00:53:02,851
These types are blind or
are they more most awful that I have seen?

614
00:53:03,565 --> 00:53:04,727
I suppose that it is a warning.

615
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:05,888
If. It works.

616
00:53:40,207 --> 00:53:41,236
Of foot.

617
00:53:48,947 --> 00:53:50,485
Luck for you that was for
here.

618
00:53:52,668 --> 00:53:53,916
If. That luck.

619
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,369
You should be grateful considering
that I saved your life.

620
00:54:01,991 --> 00:54:03,202
Are you going to go to play?

621
00:54:09,223 --> 00:54:09,765
Perhaps.

622
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,348
You are consiguendo slightly well
of this.

623
00:54:11,383 --> 00:54:14,154
It is because your men us
they have been hunting alone.

624
00:54:17,930 --> 00:54:19,349
You killed Frederik.

625
00:54:23,753 --> 00:54:24,436
I will kill you.

626
00:54:30,875 --> 00:54:33,764
Let's go to a more civilized place
to chatting.

627
00:54:33,799 --> 00:54:36,835
Put all of them in the truck.

628
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,549
We go, rise.

629
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:49,003
Where is Tarique?

630
00:54:49,038 --> 00:54:54,259
It enters the car.

631
00:55:04,831 --> 00:55:05,367
We are secret.

632
00:55:06,231 --> 00:55:07,160
How will devils find us?

633
00:55:08,237 --> 00:55:10,187
There are 3 persons in these mountains.

634
00:55:10,723 --> 00:55:11,980
You, I and Tarique.

635
00:55:14,776 --> 00:55:16,652
It is very exact.

636
00:55:16,687 --> 00:55:19,857
Good, I am not going to wait to that
return and kill us.

637
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:23,634
It will not kill us he needs help for
to find the treasure.

638
00:55:27,274 --> 00:55:28,418
Good he was thinking that we would die.

639
00:55:29,296 --> 00:55:30,661
It would not like to be known it
if it was you.

640
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:34,964
Speak to me about the translation Jack.

641
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:36,398
Where is the treasure?

642
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:39,031
What says the table?

643
00:55:39,752 --> 00:55:40,594
Veto the devil.

644
00:55:42,757 --> 00:55:44,644
The majority of persons know that I am
comprehensive.

645
00:55:44,679 --> 00:55:46,387
So we are civilized.

646
00:55:46,422 --> 00:55:48,161
For you or for the well-being of her.

647
00:55:51,092 --> 00:55:53,112
Only say to me the place.

648
00:55:54,649 --> 00:55:55,098
Say to me.

649
00:55:55,738 --> 00:55:56,268
Make it alone.

650
00:55:57,102 --> 00:55:58,715
You will see already.

651
00:56:02,661 --> 00:56:06,043
I have no respect as women
of your class.

652
00:56:13,922 --> 00:56:15,352
This was a compliment, bitch.

653
00:56:25,951 --> 00:56:27,638
Jack I can make this very painful
if you wish it.

654
00:56:29,043 --> 00:56:31,658
we speak what we did in the past.

655
00:56:32,193 --> 00:56:33,764
This day of payment is for everything
the life.

656
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:36,091
Allow her to go.

657
00:56:36,862 --> 00:56:37,752
She does not know anything.

658
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:39,830
But you if

659
00:56:40,705 --> 00:56:42,362
So you do not teach him
the sense of the life.

660
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:44,597
Only say to me what I want
to know.

661
00:56:56,825 --> 00:56:58,497
There is something to speak...

662
00:57:01,036 --> 00:57:02,536
The half.

663
00:57:03,926 --> 00:57:04,372
Liberate her.

664
00:57:05,650 --> 00:57:06,574
And do not try to negotiate with me.

665
00:57:06,609 --> 00:57:07,610
You are not in position

666
00:57:08,333 --> 00:57:10,974
I am sure that to your clients
they will not like that you do not expire

667
00:57:11,009 --> 00:57:11,806
with your promise.

668
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:18,169
Since you know.

669
00:57:18,204 --> 00:57:18,871
Fact.

670
00:57:18,906 --> 00:57:19,666
Leave her.

671
00:57:21,975 --> 00:57:22,584
You are a bastard.

672
00:57:28,324 --> 00:57:29,848
It will be better that you are saying
the truth.

673
00:57:33,042 --> 00:57:34,376
I want to know 2 things first.

674
00:57:35,773 --> 00:57:37,738
How is it that you found out of
table? =

675
00:57:37,773 --> 00:57:39,713
And what is what they have to see
the Russian?

677
00:57:47,475 --> 00:57:48,694
And this is what my clients want.

678
00:57:48,729 --> 00:57:51,177
Really you do not know it.

679
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,701
It was known that he did not have to trust
never in him.

680
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:05,310
Of nothing, only it gives us something
of time.

681
00:58:05,345 --> 00:58:07,219
Now allow me to think.

682
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:12,312
I have to extract us of here.

683
00:58:13,926 --> 00:58:16,427
I am not going to save them again.

684
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:18,551
Ok, keep silent about you.

685
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:24,028
We go.

686
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:42,118
Descanzaremos here.

687
00:58:59,726 --> 00:59:00,758
You did not call your wife in
station.

688
00:59:00,793 --> 00:59:02,344
You called it to.

689
00:59:02,379 --> 00:59:03,282
Not, please.

690
00:59:04,134 --> 00:59:05,423
How did you know that it would be there?

676
00:57:41,816 --> 00:57:47,440
Your calls are chuponeadas.


691
00:59:07,512 --> 00:59:09,819
To the only person that I called
it was to my wife

692
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:12,370
He would never betray you.

693
00:59:13,137 --> 00:59:13,929
Why did you return?

694
00:59:14,609 --> 00:59:15,325
So that they follow us?

695
00:59:17,406 --> 00:59:18,200
Hold.

696
00:59:19,086 --> 00:59:20,513
I returned to save it.

697
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:23,098
What raisin with you?

698
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,638
You did not listen, they intercepted us
the calls.

699
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,656
You alocaste in the last ones
30 minutes.

700
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:37,674
Are you well?

701
00:59:39,925 --> 00:59:40,885
I believe you.

702
00:59:42,157 --> 00:59:43,697
Thank you, thank you.

703
01:00:41,823 --> 01:00:43,397
Let's try to come even there.

704
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:46,160
Perhaps podramos to find something
of help.

705
01:01:03,334 --> 01:01:06,093
I do not believe that he could support more
in the heat.

706
01:01:06,128 --> 01:01:07,181
It is a little far.

707
01:01:07,216 --> 01:01:08,817
Why do not you go and do we reach you.

708
01:01:08,852 --> 01:01:11,058
Where is this brave woman
what did I know does a pair of days?

709
01:01:11,713 --> 01:01:13,970
You are the one that is like that I
I am determinant.

710
01:01:14,005 --> 01:01:15,380
How much?

711
01:01:16,591 --> 01:01:16,965
We go.

712
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,712
there will be things that will do me
to forget.

713
01:01:42,604 --> 01:01:43,103
Not.

714
01:01:43,745 --> 01:01:44,391
I have you.

715
01:01:45,357 --> 01:01:45,846
Put your foot.

716
01:01:47,536 --> 01:01:48,118
We go.

717
01:01:50,943 --> 01:01:51,416
A bit more.

718
01:01:52,861 --> 01:01:53,589
I have you.

719
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:00,433
Thank you.

720
01:02:01,472 --> 01:02:02,424
There is no problem.

721
01:02:18,263 --> 01:02:20,225
I need to know something and want
the truth.

722
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:24,952
What happened between you and Littman?

723
01:02:32,076 --> 01:02:32,950
I knew it in a convention.

724
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,375
Later that graduates, in Utha.

725
01:02:36,302 --> 01:02:37,046
One brought me over and
he spoke to me.

726
01:02:40,785 --> 01:02:43,178
He said to me of the time of the clients
and the doors.

727
01:02:44,369 --> 01:02:45,101
And money.

728
01:02:48,168 --> 01:02:50,886
And he asked me that it should be a part of
his team.

729
01:02:52,358 --> 01:02:56,270
The sabía that he did not want to be a teacher,
I was looking for adventure.

730
01:02:57,750 --> 01:03:00,131
And this way it began, we were the big one
team.

731
01:03:00,846 --> 01:03:02,456
With the clients and me with
the files.

732
01:03:03,374 --> 01:03:05,693
But something changed.

733
01:03:05,728 --> 01:03:06,715
The empezó to take more riezgos.

734
01:03:07,598 --> 01:03:10,597
The persons started going out
hurt.

735
01:03:13,097 --> 01:03:16,346
And it was known what it was spending simply
I did not do anything in his moment.

736
01:03:18,919 --> 01:03:21,835
Simply I decided
to change.

737
01:03:24,354 --> 01:03:26,392
And to continue my senses, and I was lucky.

738
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:35,561
How do I know that you do not do this
for the money?

739
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:41,455
I suppose that likewise
he does not work for that yes.

740
01:03:47,154 --> 01:03:53,844
I smell eaten, we go, go.

741
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:01,040
Come.

742
01:04:01,075 --> 01:04:02,184
There are persons there below.

743
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:05,187
We go.

744
01:04:26,993 --> 01:04:27,595
Capture.

745
01:04:28,121 --> 01:04:28,516
It drinks.

746
01:04:37,187 --> 01:04:37,713
Thank you very much.

747
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:41,430
Slowly not very much, it is bad.

748
01:04:41,465 --> 01:04:43,462
Not, it is good, it is good.

749
01:04:46,643 --> 01:04:48,436
Now say to me wherefrom they come?

750
01:04:49,676 --> 01:04:51,265
Our car failed
in the desert.

751
01:04:52,696 --> 01:04:55,602
In the middle of the desert to half a day.

752
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:01,348
They are very brave or
very stupid.

753
01:05:01,383 --> 01:05:03,688
Errands.

754
01:05:05,407 --> 01:05:07,028
It will have a phone that we could
to use?

755
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:11,264
I have the cellular one, but there is not
coverage.

756
01:05:13,312 --> 01:05:14,737
It can take us the city of
Sight?

757
01:05:16,115 --> 01:05:20,422
It is doing late, because of it
in the night they will be my guests.

758
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:24,832
Thank you.

759
01:05:31,327 --> 01:05:32,865
Eat, eat, more and more.

760
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:36,440
I am full, cannot eat
more.

761
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,727
I have space for more.

762
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:40,961
He eats what you want.

763
01:05:43,081 --> 01:05:43,818
This is wonderful.

764
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:45,857
Thanks for his hospitality.

765
01:05:48,018 --> 01:05:50,302
I listened that the Syrians are famous
that's why.

766
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:51,628
This way friend is as we live.

767
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:54,845
It is beautiful.

768
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:56,919
It is magnificent.

769
01:05:59,005 --> 01:06:02,281
Allow me to show them what
if it is beautiful.

770
01:06:04,520 --> 01:06:06,204
I remain with the meal.

771
01:06:31,417 --> 01:06:34,385
This is simply magnificent.

772
01:06:41,797 --> 01:06:43,494
Oh, children.

773
01:06:44,248 --> 01:06:45,581
I like playing with them.

774
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:47,158
It is for through what I live.

775
01:06:47,941 --> 01:06:48,845
Forgive me.

776
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:57,528
Beautiful persons.

777
01:06:57,563 --> 01:06:59,556
A beautiful family.

778
01:06:59,591 --> 01:07:02,019
You are like that.

779
01:07:03,298 --> 01:07:04,780
With your family...

780
01:07:07,160 --> 01:07:09,145
My parents died when
it was in the university.

781
01:07:16,035 --> 01:07:16,830
It should have hurt you.

782
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:19,642
It put me in the drugs and the alcohol.

783
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:22,747
It was Frederik who saved me.

784
01:07:24,559 --> 01:07:25,710
The era the only one that was worrying.

785
01:07:27,245 --> 01:07:28,775
Me llevava to taking his courses.

786
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,129
As a guide.

787
01:07:30,937 --> 01:07:31,528
The tenía a plan.

788
01:07:33,496 --> 01:07:34,790
When we were in class.

789
01:07:35,761 --> 01:07:38,573
As soon as other students
hiban one was bringing me over this way.

790
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:41,856
And he was saying to me: Young man.

791
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,783
I have to tolerate that you are like that.

792
01:07:45,953 --> 01:07:48,195
If really you loved your parents
you must live through the life.

793
01:07:49,516 --> 01:07:50,235
Not to destroy it.

794
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:53,279
Your parents not you dejarón.

795
01:07:55,576 --> 01:07:57,248
Simply they died.

796
01:08:00,999 --> 01:08:02,919
That's why Frederik was
my family.

797
01:08:06,450 --> 01:08:08,558
It was always next to me.

798
01:08:08,593 --> 01:08:09,743
Always there.

799
01:08:12,174 --> 01:08:14,148
Where was I when he
did he need me?

800
01:08:37,701 --> 01:08:38,734
What is this?

801
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:39,899
It is a game.

802
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:41,304
That the children play.

803
01:08:41,973 --> 01:08:43,294
Called Haina Siza.

804
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:44,314
What is that?

805
01:08:46,028 --> 01:08:48,412
The big Haina hunts at night.

806
01:08:49,161 --> 01:08:53,447
And it is in the evening when
the big Haina looks with his

807
01:08:53,482 --> 01:08:55,975
red eyes for the desert
to hide.

808
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:58,968
It is not a frightful game
for the children.

809
01:09:02,572 --> 01:09:05,354
But there are worse things in
desert in the night.

810
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,360
Nashashin.

811
01:09:08,381 --> 01:09:09,778
That sounds as a game
of children.

812
01:09:10,866 --> 01:09:15,824
It is said that they have the secrets
of the deepest desert.

813
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:21,286
It is clear that alone histories are of
children who are counted in the night.

817
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:32,702
The Hashashin goes.

818
01:09:40,034 --> 01:09:40,889
Jack looks.

819
01:09:41,926 --> 01:09:43,032
The eyes of fire.

820
01:09:43,067 --> 01:09:46,207
It is of what my wife always
he is wrong.

821
01:09:46,242 --> 01:09:48,349
She is a significant woman.

822
01:09:48,384 --> 01:09:50,404
When it does not act normally.

823
01:09:52,385 --> 01:09:53,878
We need the doors
of fire.

824
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:56,525
Curse Frederik had
reason.

825
01:09:57,043 --> 01:09:57,818
Jack about whom you are speaking?

816
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:30,509
Small monkeys.


826
01:09:58,817 --> 01:10:01,327
The stone is a map, Frederik
he was saying that this was a map.

827
01:10:01,362 --> 01:10:05,421
He was saying that the treasure is escondído
the doors of fire are needed.

828
01:10:06,279 --> 01:10:07,486
This is what Frederik saw.

829
01:10:09,693 --> 01:10:11,111
We have to go there, before
Littaman.

830
01:10:13,471 --> 01:10:15,570
This night we will not sleep, steal
his van.

831
01:10:15,605 --> 01:10:18,168
We cannot steal his van,
you will leave his family in the way of

832
01:10:18,203 --> 01:10:19,881
desert.

833
01:10:19,916 --> 01:10:22,124
We will sleep and think it
in the morning.

834
01:10:37,305 --> 01:10:39,335
They ask that transport I will give to them.

835
01:10:40,656 --> 01:10:42,644
The car and 2 horses.

836
01:10:43,521 --> 01:10:43,975
Yes.

837
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:46,322
Then we can take you
van.

814
01:09:22,668 --> 01:09:25,904
But, the Hashashin is
real friend.

815
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:28,705
It is not true.


838
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:47,807
Why did not I think about that?

839
01:10:48,932 --> 01:10:50,158
I will take it and will go with
the authorities.

840
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:54,178
Not, a moment.

841
01:10:55,411 --> 01:10:57,374
Terik you will go in the van.

842
01:10:58,101 --> 01:10:59,066
You will go with the authorities.

843
01:11:00,187 --> 01:11:01,607
I need you with me, we
we will take the horses.

844
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:04,160
Since I see, normal.

845
01:11:06,741 --> 01:11:07,615
It is very kind.

846
01:11:12,467 --> 01:11:13,375
In case they get lost.

847
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:15,571
It is always necessary to be prepared.

848
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:19,027
Good luck.

849
01:11:19,795 --> 01:11:20,343
Thank you.

850
01:11:20,378 --> 01:11:37,410
It tries to be supported above.

851
01:11:37,445 --> 01:11:38,563
Skylight.

852
01:12:06,411 --> 01:12:06,800
They move.

853
01:12:06,835 --> 01:12:07,765
Excellent that is good.

854
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:08,501
Go.

855
01:12:10,281 --> 01:12:11,021
Boys move.

856
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:28,736
Where, to where they went?

857
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:31,053
In this direction?

858
01:13:31,792 --> 01:13:32,543
Ok.

859
01:13:36,739 --> 01:13:37,110
We go away.

860
01:14:09,608 --> 01:14:10,672
He turns out to be much raised for
horses.

861
01:14:11,869 --> 01:14:13,020
We have to go walking.

862
01:14:39,524 --> 01:14:42,628
The mountains with the eyes
gaps.

863
01:14:58,707 --> 01:14:59,222
We have to move.

864
01:15:17,327 --> 01:15:18,142
Only a little more.

865
01:15:21,189 --> 01:15:22,245
I cannot see anything.

866
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,722
Debit of credit something.

867
01:15:32,944 --> 01:15:33,771
It is bad.

868
01:15:33,806 --> 01:15:35,499
I believe that there is a cave there.

869
01:15:35,534 --> 01:15:36,431
it sees more rapid.

870
01:15:53,937 --> 01:15:55,085
That went out of nothing.

871
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:09,655
It looks at this.

872
01:16:15,931 --> 01:16:17,666
I have seen this.

873
01:16:17,701 --> 01:16:19,222
In my last investigations.

874
01:16:21,811 --> 01:16:23,118
Seriously?

875
01:16:35,394 --> 01:16:36,363
Let's see to where it goes.

876
01:16:58,077 --> 01:16:59,408
So that they are that?

877
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,943
Remain there.

878
01:17:39,183 --> 01:17:39,785
We are walking.

879
01:17:40,979 --> 01:17:41,501
You are crazy.

880
01:17:42,603 --> 01:17:44,155
I am not going to enter there.

881
01:17:44,781 --> 01:17:46,423
We go I am sure that this is
worse.

882
01:17:47,221 --> 01:17:47,688
He trusts in me.

883
01:17:50,027 --> 01:17:50,585
Give me your hand.

884
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:02,576
We go.

885
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:03,813
I cannot see anything here below.

886
01:18:26,634 --> 01:18:27,294
Symbols of animals.

887
01:18:29,506 --> 01:18:30,426
It has to be this.

888
01:18:32,219 --> 01:18:34,306
It seems that there is a symbol
for every tunnel.

889
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:41,636
Camel.

890
01:18:43,117 --> 01:18:43,651
Lizard.

891
01:18:45,433 --> 01:18:47,535
Let's see, scorpion.

892
01:18:49,764 --> 01:18:50,444
Snake.

893
01:18:56,510 --> 01:18:57,932
Bull.

894
01:18:57,967 --> 01:18:59,562
Do you know as they were calling it?

895
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:01,254
The big bull.

896
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:04,399
You are right, I believe that this is.

897
01:19:05,500 --> 01:19:06,181
It was clear that it was right.

898
01:19:10,069 --> 01:19:12,204
It seems ends to here.

899
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,830
I do not believe it.

900
01:19:20,641 --> 01:19:22,913
I have seen these marks in the table.

901
01:19:25,779 --> 01:19:26,271
It is a code.

902
01:19:28,621 --> 01:19:29,832
You it can decifrar.

903
01:19:30,706 --> 01:19:31,873
I can treat.

904
01:19:47,802 --> 01:19:49,241
I did not do anything.

905
01:19:52,269 --> 01:19:55,452
Until his name is remembered.

906
01:19:55,487 --> 01:19:57,768
Until his name is remembered.
What more?

907
01:19:57,803 --> 01:19:59,068
the turtle.

908
01:20:11,001 --> 01:20:11,598
I have it.

909
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:14,386
Hurry.

910
01:20:39,020 --> 01:20:39,562
Below.

911
01:20:48,033 --> 01:20:51,027
The Hashashi, it is not false.

912
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:57,935
Reunance my brothers.

913
01:21:30,521 --> 01:21:31,246
We go.

914
01:21:52,962 --> 01:21:56,018
Our annual event will begin.

915
01:22:17,531 --> 01:22:21,758
Now we will give him our respect
to the king.

916
01:24:28,976 --> 01:24:31,016
I suppose that that one is.

917
01:24:31,851 --> 01:24:32,997
This is what the Russian wants.

918
01:24:35,438 --> 01:24:36,066
To where do you go?

919
01:24:36,729 --> 01:24:37,408
Closer to look.

920
01:25:06,811 --> 01:25:07,476
Ali.

921
01:25:30,660 --> 01:25:31,433
Why?

922
01:25:31,468 --> 01:25:33,059
I feel it, because of it.

923
01:25:34,412 --> 01:25:35,392
That does not cost.

924
01:25:36,415 --> 01:25:37,799
He could not say to you.

925
01:25:38,265 --> 01:25:41,701
I am Hashashin, the descendant of
this people.

926
01:25:42,851 --> 01:25:45,434
And I have to carry this one
beautiful gift.

927
01:25:45,469 --> 01:25:47,901
Sent to our village
for the sky.

928
01:25:50,365 --> 01:25:52,655
Listen to me, Littman us is siguendo.

929
01:25:53,113 --> 01:25:54,184
It will be here in any
minute.

930
01:26:06,622 --> 01:26:07,529
Alone this is the iris.

931
01:26:08,405 --> 01:26:09,012
Where is the eye?

932
01:26:10,737 --> 01:26:14,188
With the help of a traitor
the Egyptian Pharaoh Agnotem.

933
01:26:15,358 --> 01:26:16,080
It stole the eye.

934
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:18,399
Of the king of the Ugarit.

935
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:23,878
The Pharaoh Agnotem destroyed ours
city and he looked for the eye.

936
01:26:24,769 --> 01:26:26,919
Many Hashashim died
to avoid it.

937
01:26:29,283 --> 01:26:30,862
So the eye continues in egipto.

938
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:48,636
Below, below.

939
01:26:51,728 --> 01:26:52,883
They will not find anything here.

940
01:26:52,918 --> 01:26:54,233
If they all die.

941
01:27:05,269 --> 01:27:06,509
Move rapidly.

942
01:27:18,026 --> 01:27:18,826
You have to go out of here.

943
01:27:19,456 --> 01:27:19,868
Not without you.

944
01:27:19,903 --> 01:27:21,477
I go with the iris, I will be well.

945
01:27:27,560 --> 01:27:28,492
I will be behind yours.

946
01:27:28,527 --> 01:27:30,257
It walks.

947
01:28:12,075 --> 01:28:13,504
I never trusted in you Ali

948
01:28:24,802 --> 01:28:25,598
Be going to find Hunter.

949
01:28:44,427 --> 01:28:45,517
My god.

950
01:28:51,809 --> 01:28:52,488
Do not move.

951
01:29:20,806 --> 01:29:21,989
Sueltame.

952
01:29:30,564 --> 01:29:31,919
Not adivinarás what I found.

953
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:36,442
sEl iris belongs to the persons
of Syria.

954
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:38,633
The one that finds it
it it remains.

955
01:29:41,262 --> 01:29:44,878
It is mentioned that a mesias
it came some time ago.

956
01:29:45,789 --> 01:29:47,275
This is bigger than you can
to understand.

957
01:29:50,083 --> 01:29:51,724
So I will make it simple.

958
01:29:55,461 --> 01:29:56,689
That I waste.

959
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,313
Jack you want to say good-bye him
to Nadja?

960
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:02,861
Were you looking for me?

961
01:30:07,868 --> 01:30:08,455
What do you think that you do?

962
01:30:11,143 --> 01:30:11,688
There is not to where going.

963
01:30:14,828 --> 01:30:16,018
Who says that I go to some side?

964
01:30:52,671 --> 01:30:53,617
Help me.

965
01:30:54,225 --> 01:30:55,105

967
01:31:48,727 --> 01:31:49,644
Help me.

968
01:31:56,463 --> 01:31:59,262
Jack, good work.

969
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:03,938

971
01:32:46,119 --> 01:32:46,917

974
01:33:02,987 --> 01:33:03,858
Are they well?

975
01:33:05,281 --> 01:33:05,847
Thank you Terik.

976
01:33:06,777 --> 01:33:10,382
Jack I said to you that we would turn
after friend sees.

977
01:33:10,417 --> 01:33:12,075
It dresses, I said that I would come
to your rescue.

978
01:33:12,110 --> 01:33:14,461
I am to your service.

979
01:33:15,039 --> 01:33:16,377
I brought the army with me.

980
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:20,878
Where is Littman?

981
01:33:20,913 --> 01:33:22,371
Did they see it going out?

982
01:33:50,137 --> 01:33:50,510
Hello.

983
01:33:59,182 --> 01:33:59,732
You go away already.

984
01:34:03,733 --> 01:34:04,305

985
01:34:11,463 --> 01:34:12,630
Forgive me.

986
01:34:13,835 --> 01:34:14,224
Yes.

987
01:34:14,897 --> 01:34:16,872
Something happened, I need you that you come
immediately.

988
01:34:16,907 --> 01:34:18,457
I am in Damascus.

989
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:21,178
Also I know that Littman is
in the Cairo.

990
01:34:21,213 --> 01:34:22,831
Looking for that thing about the iris.

991
01:34:22,866 --> 01:34:24,511
We cannot leave that that happens.

992
01:34:24,546 --> 01:34:26,068
He waits a minute.

993
01:34:26,631 --> 01:34:27,659
How do you know where it is
Littman?

994
01:34:29,826 --> 01:34:31,270
I cannot speak to you for
phone.

995
01:34:31,305 --> 01:34:33,076
But I am afraid that I have not been much
honest with you.

996
01:34:33,913 --> 01:34:36,368
The most important thing right now,
it is to prepare that Littman has the eye.

997
01:34:37,591 --> 01:34:39,000
You know the danger that will exist
if that happens.

998
01:34:40,527 --> 01:34:42,302

he was gathering you.
