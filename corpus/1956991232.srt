177
00:08:50,504 --> 00:08:52,897
knowing someone
is worse off than you.

178
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,899
No one's worse off
than I am, Lawrence.

179
00:08:54,943 --> 00:08:58,555
I have stretch marks
that start at my ears.

180
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:02,777
Did Charlene have your permission
to cut school twice this week

181
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,082
and leave the field trip?

182
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,823
Absolutely not.

183
00:09:05,867 --> 00:09:08,696
She only has my permission to go
to school and do her homework

184
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:11,046
and shoo the homeless away
from the front of our mansion.

185
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:13,091
My youngest sister Kathryn
used to cut school

186
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,485
and go drinking
at the 24-hour discotheque

187
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:18,358
where everyone was naked.

188
00:09:18,401 --> 00:09:20,011
Here in Manhattan?

189
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:31,153
[Charlene] Now all I wanted
was acceptance.

190
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:35,375
The school year was starting,
so I decided to go back with a new look.

191
00:09:35,418 --> 00:09:38,421
[upbeat rock music]

192
00:09:38,465 --> 00:09:40,423
I was totally convinced
looking differently

193
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:42,773
would make me feel differently.

194
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:44,558
And, oddly enough, it did.

195
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,841
With my mother's wig on my head,
I was self-empowered

196
00:09:47,991 --> 00:09:51,042
and above what everybody
else thought of me.

197
00:09:51,086 --> 00:09:54,089
Marjie Shuler,
who is "Christie Brinkley meets Satan",

198
00:09:54,132 --> 00:09:56,961
snapped me out of that idea.

199
00:09:57,005 --> 00:09:59,747
Hey, your hair
really rings my bell.

200
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,313
Ding dong!

201
00:10:01,357 --> 00:10:03,577
[laughing]

202
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:11,149
[Blanche] Charlene, you did not eat
your delicious turkey roll.

203
00:10:12,063 --> 00:10:13,630
[Charlene] I'm dieting.

204
00:10:13,674 --> 00:10:15,458
You are not dieting.

205
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:17,958
You lost your appetite because that
girl pulled you wig off at school

206
00:10:17,982 --> 00:10:20,420
and you are humiliated.

207
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:24,989
You know, you don't have
to look so happy about it!

208
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:25,990
Okay?

209
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,688
It was your wig, and she has it!

210
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:30,430
And I'm never going back
to school!

211
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:31,648
Mel.

212
00:10:31,692 --> 00:10:33,650
Mel, did you hear
that tone of voice?

213
00:10:33,694 --> 00:10:34,782
Mel?

214
00:10:34,825 --> 00:10:37,587
Mel, would you please tell her not
to speak like that to her mother?

215
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:40,788
Don't talk to your mother
like that!

216
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:49,492
[Charlene] Great.

217
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:50,362
[door slamming]

218
00:10:50,406 --> 00:10:51,886
Now everybody hated me.

219
00:10:51,929 --> 00:10:56,151
It was just one big happy
family united against me.

220
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:59,807
Except for Lawrence.
He was my only ally.

221
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:03,071
Lawrence gave me the courage
to stand up for myself.

222
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:06,509
[light orchestral music]

223
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:18,565
I sensed the satanic
blonde presence.

224
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,655
[sighs]

225
00:11:21,698 --> 00:11:23,421
The cremation ceremony
for your wig

226
00:11:23,571 --> 00:11:25,093
will be at 3:30
behind the boys' gym.

227
00:11:25,136 --> 00:11:26,442
Will you attend?

228
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:32,230
Only if your bobby-socks
boobs are fine enough with it!

229
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:34,537
[laughing]

230
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:39,063
Bobby-socks boobs!
She has bobby-socks boobs!

231
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:40,107
Whoo!

232
00:11:45,156 --> 00:11:46,549
I loved Todd.

233
00:11:46,593 --> 00:11:48,725
If only my parents
could have seen it.

234
00:11:48,769 --> 00:11:51,293
I tried reasoning with my dad.

235
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:55,732
- Dad.
- Hmm?

236
00:11:55,776 --> 00:11:57,865
- Oh.
- Hi.

237
00:11:57,908 --> 00:11:59,693
Do you want some, um,
cookies with your tea?

238
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:00,998
What tea?

239
00:12:01,042 --> 00:12:03,087
You just talked over it.
I can't drink that now.

240
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,438
Dad, I'm your daughter, okay?
Our germs are related.

241
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:07,265
It's just tea.

242
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,094
Oy! Ugh!
Get me my eyewash.

243
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,978
Do you have to spit when you talk?
My goodness.

244
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:17,537
[upbeat rock music]

245
00:12:18,929 --> 00:12:22,498
[Charlene] Then I tried
reasoning with my mom.

246
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:30,811
You are forbidden to see
that Flatbush boy ever again!

247
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,465
Lawrence!

248
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:35,511
They say you people
are excellent athletes.

249
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,034
Go get her for me.

250
00:12:44,085 --> 00:12:45,695
Charlene!
Charlene!

251
00:12:45,739 --> 00:12:47,392
Hold it, child.
Easy.

252
00:12:47,436 --> 00:12:49,046
Take it easy.
All right.

253
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:50,657
Now good luck, hmm?

254
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,674
And remember, keep your eyes
open and your mouth shut

255
00:12:56,824 --> 00:12:58,969
before your foot can walk in.

256
00:12:59,013 --> 00:13:02,103
Mine has already worn
a path through my mouth.

257
00:13:02,146 --> 00:13:05,323
- It's too late, Lawrence.
- All right.

258
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:10,067
[upbeat rock music]

259
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:20,948
[Charlene] Hi.

260
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:21,991
Oh, no.

261
00:13:22,863 --> 00:13:25,169
Now what are we gonna do?

262
00:13:25,213 --> 00:13:28,042
Todd, they won't let me see you.

263
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:31,132
Come inside.

264
00:13:38,052 --> 00:13:39,793
Look, that's just it.

265
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:44,406
What if your parents
called the police?

266
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,581
Hmm?

267
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,585
The moment we're seen,
I'll be arrested for violating a minor.

268
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:51,892
Call your parents.

269
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:55,373
Tell them you're coming home.

270
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,290
What about us, Todd?

271
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:08,082
I... Charlene, maybe they're right.
Maybe it's for the best.

272
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,480
I can't jeopardize my dream

273
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,479
of one day owning
my dad's gas station.

274
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,485
[kids giggling]
[funk music]

275
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:22,923
Get in here!

276
00:14:24,794 --> 00:14:28,319
Mother, Father, forgive me,
for I have sinned.

277
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:29,538
Not good enough, Charlene.

278
00:14:29,581 --> 00:14:31,409
Do you understand me?
Not good enough!

279
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:32,367
We were worried sick!

280
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,059
I never thought I would live
to see the day

281
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,520
that my own daughter
turned out to be,

282
00:14:35,544 --> 00:14:37,894
close your ears, children, a tramp!
A tramp!

283
00:14:37,938 --> 00:14:40,680
I am ashamed, ashamed to
be seen with you in public.

284
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:44,901
Go upstairs and don't come
down until you go to college.

285
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:46,381
Are all my suitcases in?

286
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:48,054
[Mel] Everything's in.
I have your typewriter.

287
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:48,862
Okay.

288
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:51,081
Lawrence!
Lawrence, we're leaving!

289
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,256
Oh, look at you!

290
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,432
- Is that okay?
- Very college.

291
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,434
[laughs]

292
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,741
Okay, all right.

293
00:14:58,785 --> 00:14:59,742
Remember everything
I have told you.

294
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:01,352
Yeah, I always do.

295
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:05,835
Eat breakfast no matter what.
It doesn't matter.

296
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,160
Men like a girl with a
little flesh on them.

297
00:15:07,184 --> 00:15:11,101
And promise me, whatever you do,
remember the hitchhiking girl in Boston.

298
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:13,103
- That man was drunk...
- Hacked off her arms.

299
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,540
He chopped off her arms.
He's free, Charlene.

300
00:15:15,584 --> 00:15:17,673
- Okay, all right.
- Her life was ruined.

301
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:19,153
She could never eat M&M's.

302
00:15:19,196 --> 00:15:20,894
She could never eat corn
on the cob.

303
00:15:20,937 --> 00:15:23,897
She could never knit anymore.
Be careful.

304
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,594
Okay, I'll be careful!
Bye.

305
00:15:25,637 --> 00:15:28,031
Bye.
Bye.

306
00:15:28,075 --> 00:15:29,945
Bye!
Bye!

307
00:15:31,687 --> 00:15:32,862
Bye, Daddy.

308
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:34,797
Did mother tell you about
the hitchhiker from Boston?

309
00:15:34,821 --> 00:15:35,952
Yeah, yeah, she told me.

310
00:15:35,996 --> 00:15:38,302
- Be careful.
- Okay.

311
00:15:38,346 --> 00:15:40,498
- Wait, where's my typewriter?
- There's your typewriter.

312
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,567
Call!
Call!

313
00:15:42,611 --> 00:15:43,806
- [Charlene Voiceover]
I was free at last.

314
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,136
I was off to college
to pursue my dreams.

315
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,662
It turned out being grounded so much
helped me develop a vivid imagination.

316
00:15:50,706 --> 00:15:54,492
I was convinced I was going to be
the next great American writer.

317
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,536
Bye!

00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,723
[Charlene] When I first saw Ray,
it was love at first sight.

320
00:16:20,867 --> 00:16:23,173
- Charlene.
- What?

321
00:16:23,217 --> 00:16:27,787
You're like a sports car
parked at the curb.

322
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:31,486
Even when it sits there,
it still looks fast.

323
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,445
It's my energy.

324
00:16:34,489 --> 00:16:39,015
I've been told I have
an aura of noise about me.

325
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:40,059
You do.

326
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,849
I'm gonna be the last boyfriend
you'll ever have.

327
00:16:46,893 --> 00:16:50,418
Are you planning to marry me
or kill me?

328
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:56,250
[knocking on door]

329
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:57,293
Enter.

330
00:17:06,869 --> 00:17:09,524
Mom, Dad, I'm getting married.

331
00:17:11,743 --> 00:17:14,921
Charlene, I, I didn't even
know you were going with anyone.

332
00:17:14,964 --> 00:17:18,588
Well, I was afraid if I told
you about Ray,

333
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:19,882
you'd forbid me to see him.

334
00:17:19,926 --> 00:17:21,884
Did he at least give you
an engagement ring?

335
00:17:21,928 --> 00:17:22,885
Yeah.

336
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,235
May I see it, please?
May I just see it?

337
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,847
[laughs]

338
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:29,326
Oh, Charlene.

339
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:30,632
That is a pearl!

340
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:34,244
Not an engagement ring,
that is a cocktail ring.

341
00:17:34,288 --> 00:17:35,376
Learn the difference.

342
00:17:35,419 --> 00:17:39,423
An engagement ring is a diamond,
a cocktail ring is a pearl.

343
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,924
I don't even want to hear about this
boy anymore, do you understand me?

344
00:17:41,948 --> 00:17:43,969
I don't want hear about him
until you get a real engagement ring.

345
00:17:43,993 --> 00:17:46,647
He's a loser!
Lose him!

346
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:49,129
He's not a loser.

347
00:17:54,221 --> 00:17:55,831
He has his own car.

00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,756
No sooner did I say I do
when my sister said...

350
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,105
And I do, too!

351
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,630
Joel and I have just
decided to get married.

352
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:13,674
Hey!

353
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:17,960
[Charlene Voiceover] Goosed!

354
00:18:17,984 --> 00:18:20,508
On this, my very
own wedding day,

355
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:23,859
she announces her engagement
to Mr. Harvard Law School,

356
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:28,211
and I was marrying a man
who worked at Carpet World.

357
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:41,964
Where am I?

358
00:18:43,009 --> 00:18:45,620
We're in the hospital.

359
00:18:45,663 --> 00:18:47,448
How did we get here?

360
00:18:47,491 --> 00:18:49,145
What happened to us?

361
00:18:50,538 --> 00:18:53,758
We had a race car accident
on the way to the hotel.

362
00:18:53,802 --> 00:18:56,500
A driver on the other side of
the road crashed right into us!

363
00:18:56,544 --> 00:18:58,589
No witnesses!
No insurance!

364
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:01,201
The car vanished into thin air!

365
00:19:02,637 --> 00:19:04,548
It took eight months for me to realize

366
00:19:04,698 --> 00:19:07,816
that it was God behind the wheel
of the car that crashed us.

367
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:10,688
Does that answer your question?

368
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:12,493
He must have been trying
to stop us

369
00:19:12,643 --> 00:19:14,605
from continuing
our hour-long marriage.

370
00:19:14,649 --> 00:19:16,651
No.
Do you speak any English?

371
00:19:16,694 --> 00:19:18,783
- Charlene!
- What?

372
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:20,611
I'm leaving you.

373
00:19:20,655 --> 00:19:22,613
This isn't working out.

374
00:19:22,657 --> 00:19:25,616
[upbeat rock music]

375
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,169
[Charlene Voiceover]
My disastrous first marriage over,

376
00:19:37,193 --> 00:19:40,240
I decided to concentrate
on my writing career.

377
00:19:40,283 --> 00:19:45,767
After sending out over 1,000 resumes,
I finally landed my first interview.

378
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:55,516
[laughing]

379
00:19:57,518 --> 00:19:58,693
[clears throat]

380
00:19:58,736 --> 00:20:01,348
Well, it, it's a nice resume,
you know?

381
00:20:01,391 --> 00:20:03,045
It's not a great resume.

382
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:05,743
See, what's missing
from this resume

383
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:09,225
is I don't hear it say,
"Hire me".

384
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:12,794
A great resume says, "Hire me".
You hear it.

385
00:20:12,837 --> 00:20:15,710
Do you hear anything?
I'm not hearing anything.

386
00:20:15,753 --> 00:20:17,668
I'm listening, but I don't hear.

387
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:20,628
A great resume goes,
"Please hire me!

388
00:20:20,671 --> 00:20:23,935
"Hire me right now
or I'll die in the streets!

389
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:25,502
"Oh, God, hire me!"

390
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,985
And I don't hear that here.

391
00:20:31,073 --> 00:20:33,075
Okay, um, Mr. Levy,

392
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:36,470
I know my resume doesn't sound
desperate enough to you,

393
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:39,864
but I would do anything
to get this job.

394
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:44,086
- Look.
- What?

395
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,305
I was thinking.

396
00:20:45,348 --> 00:20:48,090
You know,
I could easily hire you.

397
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:49,613
Really?

398
00:20:49,657 --> 00:20:53,313
But see, the problem is
I'd be killing your career.

399
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:54,531
You would?

400
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,987
I'd be taking your career
and crushing, ow!

401
00:20:56,011 --> 00:20:56,968
Ow!

402
00:20:57,012 --> 00:20:58,622
- You did it again.
- I'm sorry.

403
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:02,626
- Like five fishhooks.
- Sorry.

404
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,672
[sighs]

405
00:21:05,629 --> 00:21:06,978
I'd be killing your career.

406
00:21:07,022 --> 00:21:09,764
You're too good to be doing
comic books.

407
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:11,983
- I am?
- Yeah.

408
00:21:12,027 --> 00:21:13,855
I mean, look, did Shakespeare
do comic books?

409
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:16,118
I don't know.
Did he?

410
00:21:16,162 --> 00:21:17,815
No, he didn't.

411
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,252
[sighs]

412
00:21:19,295 --> 00:21:24,039
Anyway, look, I think you
should go out to the West Coast.

413
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,301
Really?

414
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:27,303
That way, you could live
and move ahead.

415
00:21:27,347 --> 00:21:30,350
That's where you could spread
your wings.

416
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:31,393
Oh.

417
00:21:32,656 --> 00:21:33,875
Oh, I see.

418
00:21:33,918 --> 00:21:36,138
Now that I've spread my legs,
you mean.

419
00:21:36,182 --> 00:21:37,096
Is that what you're saying?

420
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,968
Okay, so I probably shouldn't
have slept with him.

421
00:21:40,011 --> 00:21:42,710
But he did give me
one good piece of advice.

422
00:21:42,753 --> 00:21:46,061
I decided to join
my sister in LA.

423
00:21:46,105 --> 00:21:48,498
Louise says there are
six things a woman

424
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:50,457
needs to get ahead here.

425
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,199
White clothes,
blonde highlights,

426
00:21:56,506 --> 00:21:58,378
a tan, breast implants,

427
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:06,099
a good agent,
and the most important thing,

428
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:09,035
a psychic.

429
00:22:09,563 --> 00:22:10,607
Oh, man.

430
00:22:10,651 --> 00:22:11,782
Pack, Charlene.

431
00:22:11,826 --> 00:22:16,439
Your sister's in therapy now
and is finally putting herself first.

432
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:18,113
[Charlene] You're gonna
throw me out, Louise?

433
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:19,094
Again?

434
00:22:19,138 --> 00:22:21,183
I just moved to Los Angeles.
I thought...

435
00:22:21,227 --> 00:22:22,967

Louise.

436
00:22:23,011 --> 00:22:27,102
I see you're gonna sell two TV scripts
and marry your boyfriend Mark.

437
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:27,929
Oh!

438
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:29,409
Congratulations.

439
00:22:31,411 --> 00:22:32,890
You two have a brother

440
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,992
and he's gonna need
his own private bank

441
00:22:36,142 --> 00:22:38,220
to store all the money he's
gonna make as a TV producer.

442
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,375
[Charlene] Wow.

443
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,551
It's really kind of exciting.

444
00:22:41,595 --> 00:22:42,770
Oh.

445
00:22:42,813 --> 00:22:44,075
Oh.

446
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,251
[Charlene] What?

447
00:22:45,294 --> 00:22:46,904
I see two sisters
working with him.

00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,254
Oh!

[Psychic] Louise and Karen.

450
00:22:50,473 --> 00:22:51,387
Karen?

451
00:22:51,431 --> 00:22:52,910
Wait a minute, um, Miss Psychic.

452
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:56,518
As you know, I'm paying
good money for this reading,

453
00:22:56,668 --> 00:22:58,544
and I don't wanna hear
about Cliff and Dave and Karen.

454
00:22:58,568 --> 00:23:00,527
I wanna hear about me.
What about me?

455
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:01,745
What happens to me?

456
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:03,245

your cup right here.

457
00:23:03,269 --> 00:23:04,226

459
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:05,923
What?

460
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:09,927
You're going to marry
a doctor named Steven.

461
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,364
[Louise] Ooh.

462
00:23:11,407 --> 00:23:15,890
I'm gonna marry a doctor?
A doctor named Steven?

463
00:23:15,933 --> 00:23:17,389

it says right here.

Oh, my God!
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.

465
00:23:19,633 --> 00:23:23,985
Does it, how, how do I meet him?
What, what do I do?

466
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:26,509
Just live your life and
he'll present himself.

What life?

[Charlene] What?

470
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:35,170
You, too, will know success,
but first you will know Steven.

472
00:23:37,825 --> 00:23:40,131
[Charlene] Lola's
predictions were coming true.

473
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:44,397

Dad?
Oh, my God!

00:23:52,492 --> 00:23:53,449
Daddy!

477
00:23:53,493 --> 00:23:56,365
Daddy!
Are you all right?

478
00:23:57,323 --> 00:23:58,846
Daddy, talk to me!

479
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:02,806
I hate this family so much!

480
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:05,461
Please send an ambulance
right away!

481
00:24:05,505 --> 00:24:07,202

a heart attack!

Please don't die!

We love you so much!
Please, Daddy!

Say something!

00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:26,265
Are the caterers
still gonna charge us?

get his Rolex.

492
00:24:27,353 --> 00:24:29,224
They steal everything.

493
00:24:37,711 --> 00:24:39,452
Doc, what happened to me?

494
00:24:39,495 --> 00:24:43,760
Too much excitement
and a little indigestion, Mel.

495
00:24:43,804 --> 00:24:44,935
You're gonna be fine.

496
00:24:44,979 --> 00:24:45,979
[All] Ah!

497
00:24:47,111 --> 00:24:49,764
I only hope my heart is half
as strong as yours

498
00:24:49,914 --> 00:24:51,420
when I'm 10 years
younger than you.

499
00:24:51,464 --> 00:24:52,334
Aw.

500
00:24:52,378 --> 00:24:54,380
Excuse me, Dr. Steven?

501
00:24:55,859 --> 00:24:58,775
May I have a word with you?

502
00:24:58,819 --> 00:25:00,037
Certainly.

503
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:00,864
Is this covered
by the insurance?

504
00:25:00,908 --> 00:25:01,822
I made a phone call.

505
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:04,215
Not only are we covered,
we're making money, Mel.

506
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,826
[Charlene] My name's Charlene.

507
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,001
Hi, Charlene.

508
00:25:07,044 --> 00:25:08,089
I have a little problem,

509
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:10,221
and I was wondering
if you could help me with it.

510
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:11,353
What's the problem?

511
00:25:11,397 --> 00:25:14,763
I, too, have a tremendous
pain in my heart,

512
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:17,838
and I'm not a hypochondriac
like my father.

513
00:25:17,881 --> 00:25:20,319
What can I do for you, Charlene?

514
00:25:20,362 --> 00:25:25,324
Well, I was wondering if you
might like to examine my chest.

515
00:25:27,282 --> 00:25:29,544
- I'd be delighted.
- Thank you.

[inhales]
[exhales]

517
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,157
Wow.

518
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:37,510
You have a very big heart.

519
00:25:37,553 --> 00:25:41,905
Um, that's because
I'm not wearing a bra.

520
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:44,081
[giggles]

521
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:47,824
I have a nine-inch needle that
can cure pretty much anything.

522
00:25:47,868 --> 00:25:51,306
Nine inches?
Will it hurt?

523
00:25:52,263 --> 00:25:53,569
Yes.

524
00:25:53,613 --> 00:25:57,051
But I could
give it to you orally.

525
00:25:57,094 --> 00:26:00,316
Well, Doctor, I think I may be in need

526
00:26:00,466 --> 00:26:03,274
of that kind of extreme treatment
sometime in the very near future,

705
00:34:56,372 --> 00:34:57,372
Oh!

706
00:35:02,335 --> 00:35:06,426
- Hello.
- Hello, Dr. Steven Stevenson.

707
00:35:06,469 --> 00:35:08,123
- Yes, uh...
- Charlene.

708
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:09,951
- Charlene.
- Yes.

709
00:35:09,995 --> 00:35:12,345
- So nice to see you.
- Thank you.

710
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:15,565
- How tall are you?
- Um, I'm five, seven.

711
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,875
- How much do you weigh?
- I don't know.

712
00:35:20,919 --> 00:35:24,009
Why don't you pick me up
and find out?

713
00:35:24,052 --> 00:35:25,793
It's not that important.
Don't mind me.

714
00:35:25,836 --> 00:35:28,274
- Please have a seat.
- All right.

715
00:35:28,317 --> 00:35:31,122
It's just that most women who wear
long skirts don't have nice legs.

716
00:35:31,146 --> 00:35:32,887
Hmm.
Really?

717
00:35:32,931 --> 00:35:37,016
You see, I'm used to dating
girls who wear short skirts or dresses

718
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:40,590
if they have nice legs,
or a cut above the knee if they don't.

719
00:35:40,634 --> 00:35:44,377
Oh. Well,
how unbelievably fascinating.

720
00:35:45,595 --> 00:35:49,382
Oh, I'm sorry,
did I accidentally kick, what?

721
00:35:49,425 --> 00:35:52,776
- What, the shoes are no good?
- Well, that depends.

722
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:53,690
[Charlene] Uh-huh.

723
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:57,299
Do you think sexy is cool?

724
00:36:00,219 --> 00:36:02,961
Is this a trick question?

725
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:05,485
Don't mind me.
I'm just a doctor, you know me.

726
00:36:05,528 --> 00:36:07,226
[laughs]

727
00:36:07,269 --> 00:36:08,531
That's right.

728
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:10,490
That's what I keep
reminding myself.

729
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,579
You're just a doctor.

730
00:36:12,622 --> 00:36:18,193
Just a pugilistic, athletic,
motorcycle-riding, fun-loving doctor.

731
00:36:18,237 --> 00:36:19,673
What do I know?

732
00:36:21,066 --> 00:36:23,459
Well, I think it's
time for a drink.

733
00:36:23,503 --> 00:36:26,810
- How about a glass of wine?
- I would love a glass of wine.

734
00:36:26,854 --> 00:36:27,854
Perfect.

735
00:36:31,337 --> 00:36:32,923
- [Charlene Voiceover]
His message was clear.

736
00:36:32,947 --> 00:36:34,775
I had to completely
change my style

737
00:36:34,818 --> 00:36:36,733
if I wanted to date him.

738
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:40,911
I was outraged at how
readily I was willing to

739
00:36:40,955 --> 00:36:43,523
transform myself to please him.

740
00:36:46,656 --> 00:36:49,659
[upbeat rock music]

741
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:27,958
Charlene?

742
00:37:28,002 --> 00:37:29,656
[retching]

743
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:30,657
You okay?

744
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:35,009
[retching]
[coughing]

745
00:37:40,145 --> 00:37:42,103
You want a napkin?

746
00:37:42,147 --> 00:37:43,844
Thank you.

747
00:37:43,887 --> 00:37:45,715
[coughs]

748
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:47,674
I think I got nauseous.

749
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:52,461
You were going around
those turns so fast, I just...

750
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:56,248
Charlene, I'm sorry,
but I, I just think that, uh,

751
00:37:56,291 --> 00:37:57,684
this is not gonna
work out with us.

752
00:37:57,727 --> 00:37:59,860
We're just too different.

753
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,384
Okay.

754
00:38:02,428 --> 00:38:04,343
Let me take you back home.
Come on.

755
00:38:04,386 --> 00:38:06,040
No.
You know what?

756
00:38:06,084 --> 00:38:08,390
I think I'll just walk.
It's not that far.

757
00:38:09,565 --> 00:38:12,829
Charlene, hold on a second.
Come here. Come here.

758
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,483
Um, let me drive you home

759
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:16,398
and then we'll break
up later, okay?

760
00:38:16,442 --> 00:38:18,096
- Okay.
- All right?

761
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:19,749
All right?
Come on.

762
00:38:19,793 --> 00:38:21,403
- Come on.
- You won't drive too fast?

763
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:24,319
No, no, no.
I'll drive too slow, okay?

764
00:38:24,363 --> 00:38:27,061
[starts engine]

765
00:38:36,984 --> 00:38:38,942
All my children
are nose boogies.

766
00:38:38,986 --> 00:38:41,632
This is the worst blizzard
they ever had in New York,

767
00:38:41,782 --> 00:38:43,358
and, Charlene,
not one of you has called me.

768
00:38:43,382 --> 00:38:46,167
Mom, Momma, I can't believe you.

769
00:38:46,211 --> 00:38:47,690
All you do is complain.

770
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:50,171
Do I call you every time
we have an earthquake?

771
00:38:50,215 --> 00:38:51,216
No.

772
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:52,173
Okay, so fine.

773
00:38:52,217 --> 00:38:53,174
Your house is cold,

774
00:38:53,218 --> 00:38:56,438
but it's not like it was picked up
and thrown around like mine was.

775
00:38:56,482 --> 00:38:57,265
I don't...

776
00:38:57,309 --> 00:38:58,136
[Blanche sneezing]

777
00:38:58,179 --> 00:38:59,137
Mom?

778
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,095
[Blanche sneezing]

779
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:01,922
Hello, Mom?

780
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:03,184
[phone clicking]

781
00:39:03,228 --> 00:39:04,228
Mom?

782
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,275
I called my mother
looking for comfort.

783
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:09,190
I don't know
why I wasted my time.

784
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:12,628
We just got stuck in the game
of dueling disasters.

785
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:17,416
Which reminds me of my parents'
favorite pastime, dueling ailments.

786
00:39:17,459 --> 00:39:21,115
I think I just snapped
my clavicle.

787
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:25,380
Blanche, Blanche, my back
is killing me, Blanche.

788
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:27,338
My head.

789
00:39:28,470 --> 00:39:32,170
It's like two elephants
are mating inside there.

790
00:39:34,911 --> 00:39:39,002
Am I the only one who thinks
this room is spinning?

791
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:42,528
Mel, do your fingers
ever feel numb?

792
00:39:42,571 --> 00:39:44,007
Just the tips?

793
00:39:44,051 --> 00:39:45,661
- Tingling.
- Yes.

794
00:39:45,705 --> 00:39:47,315
A tingling.
Like a tingling.

795
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,578
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:39:49,622 --> 00:39:52,494
It's not a stroke, God forbid.

797
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:54,583
I'm so nauseous.

798
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:58,108
I'm so nauseous,
and yet I'm still hungry.

799
00:39:58,152 --> 00:40:02,112
- Hungry.
- I'm nauseous and I'm hungry.

800
00:40:02,156 --> 00:40:03,708
[Charlene] It was around this time

801
00:40:03,858 --> 00:40:06,595
that I realized I needed
to get a grip on my life.

802
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:09,772
There's more important things
than trying to marry a doctor

803
00:40:09,816 --> 00:40:13,733
and please my parents,
like my career.

804
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:15,952
I started a new job
writing and producing,

805
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:19,217
and I was finally
through with men.

806
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,220
[upbeat rock music]

807
00:40:23,438 --> 00:40:26,615
[Joey] Charlene,
Charlene, Charlene.

808
00:40:26,659 --> 00:40:27,921
Hello, Joey.

809
00:40:27,964 --> 00:40:29,966
You know, last night,

810
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:35,505
I had a dream that
we were lost in a desert

811
00:40:35,655 --> 00:40:37,670
without anything
to drink or eat...

812
00:40:40,325 --> 00:40:41,630
Right.

813
00:40:41,674 --> 00:40:42,936
But each other.

814
00:40:42,979 --> 00:40:47,027
That's not a dream,
that's a nightmare.

815
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,984
[slurping]

816
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,987
- What is that bewitching scent?
- It's Bengay.

817
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:51,814
Oh.

818
00:40:51,858 --> 00:40:52,772
Hmm.

819
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:54,600
- You know something, Joey?
- Yeah?

820
00:40:54,643 --> 00:40:58,956
Not all women are susceptible
to a gorgeous guy

821
00:40:59,106 --> 00:41:02,260
with a great body such as
yourself and no personality.

822
00:41:05,654 --> 00:41:08,744
Honey, the stone age is over.
This is the '90s.

823
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:09,789
Get with it.

824
00:41:12,705 --> 00:41:15,534

00:41:18,406 --> 00:41:19,406
Oh!

[passionate moaning]

830
00:41:27,981 --> 00:41:28,981
Charlene?

831
00:41:30,157 --> 00:41:32,202
Charlene, I need to
speak to you at once.

832
00:41:32,246 --> 00:41:35,249
[Charlene] Hold on one second.

833
00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,250
I'll be right out.

834
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,905
Hurry.
This is an emergen...

835
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:41,995
I'm terribly sorry, Jane.

836
00:41:42,038 --> 00:41:44,084
I was right in the middle
of something.

837
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:46,347
[door rattles]

838
00:41:46,391 --> 00:41:48,973
Listen, you've got to get now
and do this trailer.

839
00:41:49,123 --> 00:41:51,296
It's not even scary.
It doesn't work.

840
00:41:51,446 --> 00:41:53,876
You've gotta put shots,
the sponsors are very upset.

841
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,226
- Okay.
- I don't like it.

842
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:57,726
You gotta have a lot of
helpless women, brutality.

843
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,925
I'll get right on it.

844
00:41:58,968 --> 00:42:01,449
Do we have any shots of animals?

845
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,930
Excuse me.

846
00:42:06,411 --> 00:42:07,760
No, excuse me.

847
00:42:10,229 --> 00:42:11,545
Um, thanks.

848
00:42:12,721 --> 00:42:14,375
Thank you, Johnny.

849
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:18,693
He, uh, he was fixing my modem.

850
00:42:19,467 --> 00:42:20,903
He's really fast.

851
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:23,253
[laughs nervously]

852
00:42:23,297 --> 00:42:24,907
- Three minutes!
- Okay.

853
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:27,301
- Now.
- Yes, sir, ma'am.

854
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:31,479
[sighing]

855
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:38,312
[explosion booming]

856
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:43,404
Okay.

857
00:42:43,448 --> 00:42:45,537
All right, um, Dick.

858
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:48,009
I don't know the technical term
for what I want next,

859
00:42:48,159 --> 00:42:50,455
but I'll just tell you
what I see in my head,

860
00:42:50,498 --> 00:42:54,459
and then you can tell me
if you can handle it, okay?

861
00:42:54,502 --> 00:42:56,504
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

862
00:42:56,548 --> 00:42:58,027
[Charlene] Excuse me?

863
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:00,009
No, I, no offense, but, I mean,

864
00:43:00,159 --> 00:43:01,311
other producers,
they don't work like this.

865
00:43:01,335 --> 00:43:02,554
I mean, they got notes.

866
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:03,748
They know what frame
they want to go to.

867
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:04,556
[Charlene] Right.

868
00:43:04,599 --> 00:43:05,470
Well, um...

869
00:43:05,513 --> 00:43:07,273
What am I supposed to do,
go back through the whole thing?

870
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:08,951
Look, Richard, Dick,

871
00:43:10,039 --> 00:43:12,868
I can understand what you are
saying about other producers,

872
00:43:12,912 --> 00:43:14,392
but all producers are different.

873
00:43:14,435 --> 00:43:16,306
I work a particular way.

874
00:43:16,350 --> 00:43:20,441
For example, a lot of Richards
don't like to be called Dick,

875
00:43:20,485 --> 00:43:22,930
but I can understand where
you're coming from,

876
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,273
'cause you see, if you know
you're a Dick right off the bat,

877
00:43:26,316 --> 00:43:29,276
why wait for other people
to find out?

878
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:31,583
What's wrong with Dick?

879
00:43:31,626 --> 00:43:33,759
All the men in my family

This is my bris.
It's not your bris.

1238
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,394
I want things the way I want it.

1239
00:58:54,418 --> 00:58:55,656
Charlene, people are listening,
keep it down.

1240
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:59,379
Mom, can I speak with you
just for a minute?

1241
00:59:04,558 --> 00:59:07,387
Mom, I have fallen
deeply in love.

1242
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:11,391
That's wonderful!
Mazel tov!

1243
00:59:11,435 --> 00:59:13,959
- What's her name?
- Her name is Leo.

1244
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:17,179
[coughs]

1245
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:20,357
You're a pansy boy?

1246
00:59:22,315 --> 00:59:24,404
Cliff, it's all right.
It's all right.

1247
00:59:24,448 --> 00:59:26,295
- It's not your fault, it's my fault.
- Mom, it's not anybody's fault.

1248
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:27,494
It's my fault, Cliffy.

1249
00:59:27,538 --> 00:59:29,037
I should've never have
let you pick out fabric.

1250
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:30,430
I should've never have
let you paint my toenails.

1251
00:59:30,454 --> 00:59:32,406
I should never, never,
never let you go

1252
00:59:32,556 --> 00:59:34,283
three years in a row
as Cher on Halloween.

1253
00:59:34,327 --> 00:59:35,284
Come on, he's here.

1254
00:59:35,328 --> 00:59:36,721
I want you to meet him.

1255
00:59:36,764 --> 00:59:37,461
- [Charlene Voiceover]
Personally, I have nothing

1256
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:38,679
against gay men.

1257
00:59:38,723 --> 00:59:40,768
It's just that every
time they get together,

1258
00:59:40,812 --> 00:59:43,118
I lose two potential husbands.

1259
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:44,337
This is Leo.

1260
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:47,471
Oh!

1261
00:59:47,514 --> 00:59:48,341
Mom!

1262
00:59:48,385 --> 00:59:49,168
Oh, my God!

1263
00:59:49,211 --> 00:59:49,995
Call 911!

1264
00:59:50,038 --> 00:59:50,822
Honey!

1265
00:59:50,865 --> 00:59:51,649
What have I done?

1266
00:59:51,692 --> 00:59:53,215
Mel!

1267
00:59:53,259 --> 00:59:54,565
He's got braids.

1268
00:59:57,437 --> 01:00:00,527
[knocking on door]

1269
01:00:00,571 --> 01:00:03,791
Hola.
Marisole Martinez?

1270
01:00:03,835 --> 01:00:06,315
Si. Hola.
Senora...

1271
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:08,100
Charlene.
Call me Charlene.

1272
01:00:08,143 --> 01:00:10,232
- Charlene, me gusta, Charlene.
- Thank you.

1273
01:00:10,276 --> 01:00:13,627
The kids are upstairs, sleeping.

1274
01:00:13,671 --> 01:00:14,498
[speaking foreign language]

1275
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:16,108
Yes, yes.

1276
01:00:16,151 --> 01:00:18,458
So, um,
no, no, no, no, no.

1277
01:00:18,502 --> 01:00:21,461
Come in, come in,
come in, come in.

1278
01:00:21,505 --> 01:00:23,637
We'll go upstairs
and take a look at them.

1279
01:00:23,681 --> 01:00:25,726
Hasta la vista.
Andale.

1280
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,380
[both laugh]

1281
01:00:27,424 --> 01:00:30,731
It was tough being a single mom,
but with Marisole's help,

1282
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:32,472
we got through
the terrible twos.

1283
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:34,494
Can you clear for a minute
while me and my boys pass?

1284
01:00:34,518 --> 01:00:36,171
You see,
when my boys are big enough,

1285
01:00:36,215 --> 01:00:37,671
and they'll be playing
with you, too.

1286
01:00:37,695 --> 01:00:39,566
In your dreams, lady!

1287
01:00:41,394 --> 01:00:42,743
Excuse me?

1288
01:00:42,787 --> 01:00:44,571
That one's not a boy,
that's a girl.

1289
01:00:44,615 --> 01:00:46,530
No, he's not!
He's a boy!

1290
01:00:46,573 --> 01:00:48,096
No, that's a girl!

1291
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:51,491
No, he's a boy, and he's macho,
just like his mom!

1292
01:00:51,535 --> 01:00:53,406
You're not macho!
You have titties!

1293
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:54,494
Ha.

1294
01:00:54,538 --> 01:00:55,408
No, wait a minute.

1295
01:00:55,452 --> 01:00:57,497
These are not titties,
they're hand grenades,

1296
01:00:57,541 --> 01:00:59,151
and I'm gonna throw
one at you right now!

1297
01:00:59,194 --> 01:01:00,282
You, too!

1298
01:01:00,326 --> 01:01:02,241
That's right, kids!
Keep running!

1299
01:01:02,284 --> 01:01:04,243
That's right!
Keep running!

1300
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,377
Unbelievable!
Where are their mothers?

1301
01:01:08,421 --> 01:01:11,380
Can you believe that?
Unbelievable.

1302
01:01:11,424 --> 01:01:13,426
When you get big,
don't play with those bad boys.

1303
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,429
[light jazz music]

1304
01:01:17,996 --> 01:01:20,172
Between writing and
taking care of my kids,

1305
01:01:20,215 --> 01:01:23,262
it had been a long time
since my last date.

1306
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,351
One day while cleaning
out my closet,

1307
01:01:25,394 --> 01:01:28,267
I found my old
Dr. Steven paper dolls.

1308
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:29,529
Now, don't get me wrong,

1309
01:01:29,573 --> 01:01:31,226
I wasn't going back
on my Steven quest,

1310
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,273
but this guy was worth
another look.

1311
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:44,718
Hello, Steven?

1312
01:01:44,762 --> 01:01:49,418
Yeah, yeah, it's Charlene.
How did you know it was me?

1313
01:01:49,462 --> 01:01:50,637
Ha ha.

1314
01:01:50,681 --> 01:01:52,726
I do not have a funny voice.

1315
01:01:52,770 --> 01:01:56,208
[light orchestral music]

1316
01:02:00,081 --> 01:02:04,738
There he was in all his Roman
god-bachelor glory.

1317
01:02:04,782 --> 01:02:08,046
Being single obviously
agreed with this guy.

1318
01:02:08,089 --> 01:02:11,901
The great thing about being
attracted to unavailable men

1319
01:02:12,051 --> 01:02:13,617
is they're always available.

1320
01:02:30,198 --> 01:02:31,765
Justice, play nice.

1321
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:35,528
[Steven] It's really nice of you
to come here with the kids.

1322
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:37,597
Yeah, they really love it here.

1323
01:02:37,641 --> 01:02:39,947
They like to play
with the balls.

1324
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:42,863
Does Mommy play
with the balls, too?

1325
01:02:42,907 --> 01:02:44,996
- Sometimes.
- Yeah?

1326
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,780
You should go in
there, too, you know?

1327
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:50,349
[Charlene] Oh, I don't think so.
I'm too big for that.

1328
01:02:50,392 --> 01:02:52,830
[Steven] Really?
[Charlene] Yeah.

1329
01:02:52,873 --> 01:02:54,658
Maybe we should
go in there together.

1330
01:02:54,701 --> 01:02:56,529
[laughs]

1331
01:02:56,573 --> 01:02:57,443
You look pretty good.

1332
01:02:57,486 --> 01:02:58,575
[Steven] Yeah?

1333
01:02:58,618 --> 01:03:01,864
You look good for an aging,
confirmed bachelor

1334
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:06,060
with no marital prospects
on the horizon any time soon.

1335
01:03:06,104 --> 01:03:08,976
[Steven]
Well, I, I loved your lips.

1336
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,803
Hmm.

1337
01:03:09,847 --> 01:03:10,848
Thank you.

1338
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,851
[Steven] I loved your lips.

1339
01:03:13,894 --> 01:03:15,461
Thank you.

1340
01:03:15,504 --> 01:03:17,637
[Steven] You're welcome.

1341
01:03:23,991 --> 01:03:25,602
Justice?

1342
01:03:25,645 --> 01:03:26,907
Justice!

1343
01:03:26,951 --> 01:03:28,996
Oh, my God!
Justice!

1344
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:29,954
Justice!

1345
01:03:29,997 --> 01:03:30,650
[Steven] It's all right.

1346
01:03:30,694 --> 01:03:32,304
Justice!
Justice!

1347
01:03:32,347 --> 01:03:34,132
Justice, where are you?
Justice!

1348
01:03:34,175 --> 01:03:36,830
Justice!
Justice, where are you?

1349
01:03:36,874 --> 01:03:39,311
Justice!
Justice, answer me!

1350
01:03:39,354 --> 01:03:40,660
[Steven] I'm looking for him!

1351
01:03:40,704 --> 01:03:42,009
Justice!

1352
01:03:42,053 --> 01:03:44,359
Justice!
Justice, this isn't funny!

1353
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,535
Where are you?
Justice!

1354
01:03:46,579 --> 01:03:49,060
Charlene, I got him.
Charlene, he's right here.

1355
01:03:49,103 --> 01:03:50,888
I got him.
I got him.

1356
01:03:50,931 --> 01:03:52,716
He's right here.
They're both right here.

1357
01:03:52,759 --> 01:03:53,673
[Charlene] Oh, my God.

1358
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:55,632
They're doing all right.
Yeah, come on.

1359
01:03:57,155 --> 01:03:58,741
He was just over here looking
at the ocean and stuff.

1360
01:03:58,765 --> 01:04:01,811
Mommy was so worried!
Oh, honey!

1361
01:04:03,248 --> 01:04:05,206
That was great.
Thanks.

1362
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,860
- You're welcome.
- I had a good time.

1363
01:04:06,904 --> 01:04:07,774
So did I.

1364
01:04:07,818 --> 01:04:09,210
Thanks for all the balloons,

1365
01:04:09,254 --> 01:04:12,692
and thanks for the
refrigerator magnet and...

1366
01:04:12,736 --> 01:04:13,780
No problem.

1367
01:04:15,042 --> 01:04:19,090
So, um, do you have
a date tonight or what?

1368
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:20,482
No, I'm just gonna go home

1369
01:04:20,526 --> 01:04:23,747
and practice my violin
and smoke my pipe.

1370
01:04:23,790 --> 01:04:24,878
Hmm.

1371
01:04:24,922 --> 01:04:26,706
- That sounds nice.
- Yeah.

1372
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:28,012
Especially the pipe part.

1373
01:04:28,055 --> 01:04:30,318
[laughs]

1374
01:04:30,362 --> 01:04:32,253
Well, I guess the boys
will sleep well tonight.

1375
01:04:32,277 --> 01:04:33,670
Yeah.

1376
01:04:33,713 --> 01:04:35,628
And if you take a Valium,
so will their mom.

1377
01:04:35,672 --> 01:04:37,717
[laughs]

1378
01:04:43,418 --> 01:04:45,029
- Oh, your coat.
- Yeah.

1379
01:04:45,072 --> 01:04:47,248
[laughs]

1380
01:04:47,292 --> 01:04:49,120
Don't wanna take that.

1381
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:53,298
[Steven] Let me help you.
[Charlene] Thank you.

1382
01:04:53,341 --> 01:04:54,342
Drive safely.

1383
01:04:54,386 --> 01:04:56,344
[Charlene] All right, I will.
I always do.

1384
01:04:56,388 --> 01:04:57,171
Okay.

1385
01:04:57,215 --> 01:04:58,259
[Charlene] Okay.

1386
01:04:58,303 --> 01:04:59,217
Take care.

1387
01:04:59,260 --> 01:05:00,131
[Charlene] All right, I will.

1388
01:05:00,174 --> 01:05:04,004
The problem with Dr. Steven Stevenson
was he's too good-looking,

1389
01:05:04,048 --> 01:05:07,529
he's too well-endowed,
and he's much too successful.

1390
01:05:07,573 --> 01:05:10,619
How could he not be
a womanizer?

1391
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:12,143
I have to move on.

1392
01:05:15,015 --> 01:05:16,321
I've laid off the doctors,

1393
01:05:16,364 --> 01:05:18,236
but the Stevens
just keep coming.

1394
01:05:18,279 --> 01:05:20,934
Ironically, my new
boyfriend's name is Steven,

1395
01:05:20,978 --> 01:05:24,242
Steven Troy,
but he's a contractor.

1396
01:05:24,285 --> 01:05:26,723
A very good one, I might add.

1397
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:32,076
Work's all finished, ma'am.

1398
01:05:32,119 --> 01:05:35,209
Did you fix the stone
on the pavement?

1399
01:05:35,253 --> 01:05:36,863
It's fixed.

1400
01:05:36,907 --> 01:05:40,127
What about the drip
in the fountain?

1401
01:05:40,171 --> 01:05:42,042
It's fixed.

1402
01:05:42,086 --> 01:05:45,742
Did you screw in the light
by the gate?

1403
01:05:45,785 --> 01:05:46,830
It's fixed.

1404
01:05:48,222 --> 01:05:50,485
Are you ready to be paid?

1405
01:05:52,661 --> 01:05:53,662
I'm ready.

1406
01:05:54,794 --> 01:05:57,144
Come upstairs, Mr. Troy.

1407
01:05:57,188 --> 01:06:01,279
I think I have something
that might interest you.

1408
01:06:04,282 --> 01:06:07,024
Good thing
I brought my hammer.

1409

1410
01:06:09,243 --> 01:06:12,377
[passionate moaning]

1411
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,990
Nice.

1412
01:06:17,034 --> 01:06:19,863
[Steven] I wanna
bronze your labia minora.

1413
01:06:19,906 --> 01:06:20,994
Really?

1414
01:06:21,038 --> 01:06:22,561
[laughs]

1415
01:06:22,604 --> 01:06:23,604
Okay.

1416
01:06:26,043 --> 01:06:29,133
[passionate moaning]

1417
01:06:30,699 --> 01:06:32,832
[giggles]

1418
01:06:38,751 --> 01:06:40,884
[moaning]

1419
01:06:42,929 --> 01:06:46,628
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Um, condoms.

1420
01:06:46,672 --> 01:06:48,543
Safe sex.
Do you have any?

1421
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,370
Uh...

1422
01:06:49,414 --> 01:06:51,851
In my bathroom.
Wait. Hold on.

1423
01:06:51,895 --> 01:06:54,245
Stay there.
Stay, stay, Rover.

1424
01:07:01,905 --> 01:07:03,167
[moaning]

1425
01:07:03,210 --> 01:07:04,864
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1426
01:07:04,908 --> 01:07:06,866
- You sure?
- Yeah.

1427
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,129
Bring it on home!

1428
01:07:09,173 --> 01:07:10,261
Oh!

1429
01:07:10,304 --> 01:07:11,566
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1430
01:07:14,482 --> 01:07:15,744
Whoo!

1431
01:07:15,788 --> 01:07:17,616
- Hell.
- Oh, God.

1432
01:07:17,659 --> 01:07:18,573
Oh!

1433
01:07:18,617 --> 01:07:20,619
- You know what they say.
- What?

1434
01:07:20,662 --> 01:07:22,708
Seventh time is a charm.

1435
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:25,232
[both laugh]

1436
01:07:25,276 --> 01:07:28,148
[knocking on door]

1437
01:07:29,410 --> 01:07:30,150
[Charlene] Hello.

1438
01:07:30,194 --> 01:07:31,064
Hey.

1439
01:07:31,108 --> 01:07:31,848
[Charlene] How are you?

1440
01:07:31,891 --> 01:07:33,893
- I'm good.
- Good.

1441
01:07:33,937 --> 01:07:35,373
How are you?

1442
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:38,898
- Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
- Good.

1443
01:07:38,942 --> 01:07:39,942
I'm fine.

1444
01:07:41,118 --> 01:07:42,075
Cute.

1445
01:07:42,119 --> 01:07:44,599
Yeah, I think, you know,
they'll like it.

1446
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:47,211
They're sleeping.
They should wake up pretty soon.

1447
01:07:47,254 --> 01:07:52,607
If you wanna wait, we can maybe
have a cup of tea out on the patio.

1448
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,436
- Okay.
- Okay.

1449
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:56,524
I'll make it.

1450
01:07:57,525 --> 01:07:59,005
I'll be right out.

1451
01:08:06,621 --> 01:08:10,069
All my divorced male friends
envy my ex-husband

1452
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:11,975
because I set him up
with other women.

1453
01:08:12,018 --> 01:08:13,237
I do it for me,

1454
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:17,487
because the happier he is,
the less guilty I feel

1455
01:08:17,637 --> 01:08:19,286
for driving him over the edge.

1456
01:08:19,330 --> 01:08:21,114
And then also for my sons,

1457
01:08:21,158 --> 01:08:22,811
because I'd like their stepmom

1458
01:08:22,855 --> 01:08:26,772
to be someone who doesn't
have a police record.

1459
01:08:33,648 --> 01:08:34,648
Here we go.

1460
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:40,917
A little tea I whipped up myself
in the recesses of my kitchen.

1461
01:08:42,309 --> 01:08:45,573
The contractor did a nice job
with the terrace.

1462
01:08:45,617 --> 01:08:50,317
Yeah, well Steven does
a great job with everything.

1463
01:08:50,361 --> 01:08:51,449
Another Steven.

1464
01:08:51,492 --> 01:08:52,972
Mm-hmm.

1465
01:08:53,016 --> 01:08:54,254
Well, obviously
you've slept with him.

1466
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:56,149
Obviously?
What obviously?

1467
01:08:56,193 --> 01:08:58,324
- Well, duh.
- Duh.

1468
01:08:59,065 --> 01:09:01,546
Okay. All right.
Fine, I slept with him.

1469
01:09:01,589 --> 01:09:05,463
- So?
- Well, like, of course you did.

1470
01:09:05,506 --> 01:09:08,596
What kind of medicine
does he practice?

1471
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:10,685
He's a sexual healer.

1472
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,078
Every time he walks in the room,

1473
01:09:12,122 --> 01:09:15,690
I hear Marvin Gaye singing
"Sexual Healing".

1474
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:17,257
Please, Charlene.

1475
01:09:20,304 --> 01:09:22,788
You know, the problem
with you and I is we just,

1476
01:09:22,938 --> 01:09:26,918
we just don't communicate
very well.

1477
01:09:27,180 --> 01:09:28,486
Boy.

1478
01:09:28,529 --> 01:09:29,529
You said it.

1479
01:09:31,184 --> 01:09:32,142
Once you ran out of songs,

1480
01:09:32,185 --> 01:09:35,580
there was really nothing left
to say, was there?

1481
01:09:41,934 --> 01:09:45,285
I do think you have
nice breasts, though.

1482
01:09:45,329 --> 01:09:46,112
Thank you.

1483
01:09:46,156 --> 01:09:47,026
[clears throat]

1484
01:09:47,070 --> 01:09:50,812
They're implants.
I'll leave them to you in my will.

1485
01:09:50,856 --> 01:09:53,380
- No way!
- Yes way.

1486
01:09:53,424 --> 01:09:54,947
Ha ha.

1487
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:57,819
- You had me fooled.
- Goosed.

1488
01:09:57,863 --> 01:09:58,951
Every time a man is fooled,

1489
01:09:58,995 --> 01:10:02,128
another plastic surgeon
gets his wings.

1490
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:04,609
That is, like, such
a good job, really.

1491
01:10:04,652 --> 01:10:06,524
Thank you.
I'm glad you appreciate it.

1492
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:08,047
Hey!

1493
01:10:08,091 --> 01:10:09,266
Hey, you!

1494
01:10:09,309 --> 01:10:11,050
Give a kiss, Daddy!

1495
01:10:12,269 --> 01:10:14,227
Come on,
I want a kiss over here, too.

1496
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,403
Come on.
Come on.

1497
01:10:16,447 --> 01:10:17,100
Give me a kiss, give me
a kiss, give me a kiss.

1498
01:10:17,143 --> 01:10:18,840
Come on.
Mmm-whah!

1499
01:10:18,884 --> 01:10:20,320
How you guys doing?

1500
01:10:20,364 --> 01:10:22,322
Who wants the chicken?
Who wants the bear?

1501
01:10:22,366 --> 01:10:23,628
Who wants the chicken?

1502
01:10:23,671 --> 01:10:25,760
You want the bear?
You want the chicken?

1503
01:10:25,804 --> 01:10:29,460
[dramatic orchestral music]

1504
01:10:39,557 --> 01:10:42,429
Who wants to play
with the truck?

1505
01:10:42,473 --> 01:10:43,473
All right!

1506
01:10:50,655 --> 01:10:53,440
[upbeat funk music]

1507
01:10:53,484 --> 01:10:57,357
Dr. Steven?
Excuse me, can you, um, hi.

1508
01:10:57,401 --> 01:10:58,184
[Steven] Hi.

1509
01:10:58,228 --> 01:10:59,055
Can I help you?

1510
01:10:59,098 --> 01:11:00,491
Um, yes.

1511
01:11:00,534 --> 01:11:03,015
As a matter of fact, you can.

1512
01:11:04,582 --> 01:11:08,365
Look, I'm in extreme need
of a physical for work,

1513
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:09,563
and since
we're in the same building,

1514
01:11:09,587 --> 01:11:12,163
I thought maybe if you give me
your card,

1515
01:11:12,313 --> 01:11:13,654
I could call you
for an appointment.

1516
01:11:13,678 --> 01:11:14,853
I'd love to.

1517
01:11:14,896 --> 01:11:16,985
Lord knows I can use
the business.

1518
01:11:17,029 --> 01:11:21,294
But unfortunately, I'm only
licensed to examine your feet.

1519
01:11:21,338 --> 01:11:22,469
My feet?

1520
01:11:22,513 --> 01:11:23,514
Only my feet?

1521
01:11:24,863 --> 01:11:26,082
A podiatrist.

1522
01:11:26,125 --> 01:11:29,346
So what exactly is it
you guys do anyway?

1523
01:11:30,521 --> 01:11:32,566
At least he's not
a proctologist.

1524
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:35,526
I wouldn't want one of those guys
handling the boys' bottles.

1525
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:41,053
I'm sure you've been told
many times you have beautiful legs.

1526
01:11:41,097 --> 01:11:44,796
Well, not many times,
but thank you.

1527
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,885
I can't believe I've never
run into you before.

1528
01:11:46,928 --> 01:11:47,799
It just seems, sorry.

1529
01:11:47,842 --> 01:11:49,540
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry.

1530
01:11:49,583 --> 01:11:51,716
Well, I know. It seems
working in the same building,

1531
01:11:51,759 --> 01:11:54,197
you'd think we'd sooner or later
bump into each other.

1532
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:57,287
Yeah, you would think,
you know, you being a podiatrist

1533
01:11:57,330 --> 01:11:59,115
and me being in sales.

1534
01:11:59,158 --> 01:12:00,028
Yeah.

1535
01:12:00,072 --> 01:12:02,181
You know, I can't help notice,
but your feet are perfect.

1536
01:12:02,205 --> 01:12:04,032
What are they,
a seven and a half, an eight?

1537
01:12:04,076 --> 01:12:05,860
Oh, my God.
You do know what you're doing?

1538
01:12:05,904 --> 01:12:06,905
They're seven and a half.

1539
01:12:06,948 --> 01:12:09,603
And those are lovely shoes.
Were they some sort of reptile?

1540
01:12:09,647 --> 01:12:11,736
Yes.
Rattlesnake.

1541
01:12:13,607 --> 01:12:16,219
Dangerous Ecuadorian
rattlesnake.

1542
01:12:16,262 --> 01:12:17,916
- Killed him myself.
- Really?

1543
01:12:17,959 --> 01:12:19,961
Skinned him.
Ate the flesh.

1544
01:12:20,005 --> 01:12:21,876
Made shoes
out of the attractive skins.

1545
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,043
Well, I think that's a good
result for a snake,

1546
01:12:24,193 --> 01:12:25,378
to end up a shoe
on a beautiful woman's foot.

1547
01:12:25,402 --> 01:12:26,794
Oh, thank you.

1548
01:12:26,838 --> 01:12:28,361
[laughs]

1549
01:12:28,405 --> 01:12:31,016
Well, so I wish I could
compliment your outfit,

1550
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:32,757
but I just can't.

1551
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:35,063
I know.
It's sort of doctor-ware.

1552
01:12:35,107 --> 01:12:36,717
- You're gonna get...
- Utilitarian.

1553
01:12:36,761 --> 01:12:38,284
Yeah.

1554
01:12:38,328 --> 01:12:39,242
[Charlene] I always wanted
to use that word in a sentence.

1555
01:12:39,285 --> 01:12:40,895
Ha ha.

1556
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:44,029
- Well, this my floor.
- Oh, really?

1557
01:12:44,072 --> 01:12:46,858
It's been highly enjoyable
traveling the escalator with you.

1558
01:12:46,901 --> 01:12:48,686
Yes.
Since we're flirting...

1559
01:12:48,729 --> 01:12:50,731
- We are?
- Well, I think we are.

1560
01:12:50,775 --> 01:12:52,255
I just wanted to
disclose the fact

1561
01:12:52,298 --> 01:12:56,084
that my wife and I of 10
years separated two weeks ago.

1562
01:12:56,128 --> 01:12:57,216
Oh, really?

1563
01:12:57,260 --> 01:12:58,435
We're getting divorced.

1564
01:12:58,478 --> 01:12:59,087
I'm not running around
or anything, but...

1565
01:12:59,131 --> 01:13:00,567
Oh.

1566
01:13:00,611 --> 01:13:03,266
- I'm really sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

1567
01:13:03,309 --> 01:13:06,471
You, uh, you seem
like somebody that's been hurt,

1568
01:13:07,171 --> 01:13:09,458
and I feel like you might
need a shoulder to cry on

1569
01:13:09,508 --> 01:13:11,012
sometime in the very near future.

1570
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:13,537
So, uh, I wanna give you this.

1571
01:13:15,756 --> 01:13:19,151
"Dr. Anton Bowman, L.C.S.W."
What does that stand for?

1572
01:13:19,195 --> 01:13:23,068
Well, it stands for a very
experienced psychotherapist.

1573
01:13:23,111 --> 01:13:24,243
I think you'll like him.

1574
01:13:24,287 --> 01:13:27,681
His fees are reasonable,
and he has quite large feet.

1575
01:13:29,509 --> 01:13:30,989
So I walked away.

1576
01:13:31,032 --> 01:13:33,864
I mean, there was nothing
wrong with this guy,

1577
01:13:34,014 --> 01:13:37,256
but I could see he wasn't ready
to start a new relationship.

1578
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:40,259
Why is it so hard to find
the perfect man?

1579
01:13:40,303 --> 01:13:43,131
It's like I found the
ideal Doctor Steven,

1580
01:13:43,175 --> 01:13:45,482
but he's a combination
of six men.

you have to pick one

Dr. Bowman, you're a genius.
Thank you so much.

Can I take these for my friends?

Hey, Noble, you wanna come
over here and enjoy the party?

So, how's your son,
the big-headed one?

it's time for him to get a...

01:15:35,809 --> 01:15:38,551
I want to get him
a really good guitar.

1620
01:15:38,595 --> 01:15:39,987
That would be great.

like, a little microphone.

Mm-hmm.

1626
01:15:48,213 --> 01:15:51,477
You look so much more
attractive with your kids.

You may have noticed everybody
at the party is called Steven.

Yeah.

1633
01:16:02,183 --> 01:16:04,838
- I have a thing for Stevens.
- Right.

You're the first really physical
Steven that I ever had.

where I ended up.

I paid him for therapy.

And my parents
are proud of me.

They finally stopped asking
when I'm gonna meet Mr. Right.

1643
01:16:31,996 --> 01:16:35,550
But more importantly,
I've stopped asking.
