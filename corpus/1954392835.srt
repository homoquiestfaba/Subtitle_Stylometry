1
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,269
"For 'ze' crime of insurrection
against the Republic of France...

2
00:02:17,337 --> 00:02:20,500
"And in accordance with
'ze' verdict of 'ze' people...

3
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:24,368
'Ze' prisoner is
condemned to death."

4
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,502
Bring "ze" foreign
exchange prisoner.

5
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:34,446
Warden, we have brought the foreign
exchange prisoner as ordered.

6
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,416
This man, Professor Mortimer
Gangreen, tomato mastermind...

7
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:43,411
Scourge of civilized society,
is to be freed at once!

8
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:47,415
There must be some mistake, Warden. He
is "ze" most dangerous man in "ze" world.

9
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:49,518
Silence! I have my orders!

10
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,255
You dare to disobey me?

11
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,290
Oh! Hold still, guys!

12
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,303
Ohh! Ohh!

13
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:00,397
Ha!

14
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,374
You are not "ze" warden!

15
00:04:06,446 --> 00:04:09,381
Hey, nice batting!
Come on, boys!

16
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,387
Let's go!

17
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,489
Hey! Don't!
Don't do that!

18
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:25,463
- Ow! Ooh! Ooh! Ahh!
- Can't take him an here!

19
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,300
Perfect.

20
00:04:37,343 --> 00:04:39,368
Up, up and away!

21
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:49,448
Well done, lads!
Well done!

22
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:55,452
To go with a balloon escape,
sir, blueberry pizza?

23
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:58,258
Ah! With jalapenos. Mmm.

24
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,524
- Let her rip, Zoltan.
- Right.

25
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,327
Bombs away!

26
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,303
All right! Aye!

27
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,406
Oh! Oh! Run!

28
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:19,349
Run!

29
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,514
Cruise tomato!

30
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:27,317
Igor, my tomatoes
are ripe for revolution.

31
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,453
I hold in my hands the
secret to world domination.

32
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:34,296
I'll give them a reign of
terror they'll never forget.

33
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:39,395
'Tis a far, far meaner thing
I do than I have ever done.

34
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,408
But that's show biz.

35
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:45,240
- Igor, to the castle!
- You got it, Professor.

36
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:51,373
Déjà vu! Potpourri!
Soup du jour!

37
00:05:56,456 --> 00:06:01,519
"Every French hotel is equipped with a
drinking fountain in the bathroom." Hmm.

38
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,355
Ok. Let's see, two francs.

39
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:09,425
And... a half a Twinkie.

40
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,369
That ought to last
me another week.

41
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:14,373
What am I worried
about? I'm 22 years old.

42
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,376
I'm backpacking through
France. Life is wonderful.

43
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:22,313
Ah, who am I kidding? Michael J.
Fox is a major motion picture star...

44
00:06:22,348 --> 00:06:26,250
And I'm making a killer
tomatoes movie... part four!

45
00:06:26,285 --> 00:06:29,254
What am I worried about?
I'm making a movie.

46
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:32,450
I'm filming in France. I got
a piece of the merchandising.

47
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:35,359
It beats dinner
theater. Hey!

48
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,489
Life is wonderful!

49
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:47,372
That was wonderful.

50
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,522
Are you real?

51
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,425
Or am I on some
kind of Twinkie high?

52
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,434
"Frankly, my dear,
I do not give a damn."

53
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:22,534
- Who are you?
- I am a beautiful French county girl.
Who are you?

54
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,244
Me?

55
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:29,237
I'm a... big American
movie star.

56
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:32,512
I love American movies!
Which one are you?

57
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:37,484
- Michael J. Fox. Hi.
- Oh, Michael!

58
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,460
This has possibilities.

59
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,456
Wait till you see it, Professor.
It's totally awesome.

60
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:49,365
I got plans. Big plans.
We'll make a mint.

61
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:53,303
Where's this castle you've
been babbling about?

62
00:07:54,507 --> 00:07:58,466
You call that a castle,
you Ayan ignoramus?

63
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:03,272
No, sir, Professor Gangreen.
That's the tool shed. That's the castle.

64
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,388
It's a little run-down.

65
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:14,257
But I'm gonna have
it painted... pastels.

66
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,524
Shops, specialty
stores, bars.

67
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:22,291
And in that tower, a
revolving restaurant.

68
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,304
And in this moat,
Igor's alligator farm.

69
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:29,374
And someday...

70
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:33,401
Time-share condominiums!

71
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,519
How do you like it, Professor?
Some hideout, huh?

72
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:48,227
- This is incredible.
- Thanks.

73
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:52,498
How can we afford all this on
my mental disability check?

74
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:59,465
Welcome to Igor's Really
Big Castle Museum.

75
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,338
- Inside you will find...
- This is the best part, Professor.

76
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,275
Exhibits from
ancient times.

77
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:07,404
Come along, folks.
Come along.

78
00:09:07,446 --> 00:09:11,212
- Wow!
- Now, folks, you've paid an
awful lot of money to be here...

79
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,411
On the super
deluxe grand tour.

80
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:18,219
Ten down, only
332 rooms to go.

81
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,384
Is one of those
a bathroom?

82
00:09:20,426 --> 00:09:23,327
Come along, folks.

83
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:26,229
Hope you enjoy your stay
at Igor's Really Big Castle.

84
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:28,494
Igor's Really Big Castle
Tour. It's a gold mine.

85
00:09:28,534 --> 00:09:32,402
Idiot! This is supposed
to be a hideout!

86
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,439
A secret hideout.

87
00:09:34,473 --> 00:09:38,500
- I'll be the laughing stock
of mad men everywhere.
- No problem. Follow me.

88
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,507
After visiting
our museum...

89
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:43,340
Be sure to stop by our
world famous gift store...

90
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,249
Featuring daily specials
on many items.

91
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,480
- You will find Igor's
Really Big Castle Museum...
- Ho, ho! I am the king.

92
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,224
Full of state-of-the-art audio
animatronic technology...

93
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,259
Ho, ho, ho.
I am the king.

94
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,318
- Joan of Ark.
- Ho, ho, ho.

95
00:09:56,395 --> 00:10:00,354
Hope you enjoy your stay
at Igor's Really Big Castle...

96
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,425
A veritable treasure trove
of really neat stum.

97
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:09,339
Before leaving, please
ask about our new time-share
condominium program. Thank you.

98
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,342
Ho, ho, ho. I am the king.

99
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:13,468
Ho, ho, ho. I am the king.

100
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:19,282
It's all here, Professor.
Everything you asked for.

101
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:26,448
It's perfect.

102
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:30,429
Wonderful.

103
00:10:33,366 --> 00:10:36,392
Oh, you even
decorated. Nice touch.

104
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:45,301
Igor.

105
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:51,448
I picked up this little tome
at the prison library. Behold.

106
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,512
The Prophecy of Nicodemus.

107
00:10:57,256 --> 00:11:02,319
"When the streets of Paris
shall run bright red.

108
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:06,297
"Then flow not
the waters of life...

109
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,493
"Be thee cold and dead.

110
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:14,296
"Be azure skies turned
black as night unfurled.

111
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:19,504
"Where a weeping virgin stands
watch o'er the Underworld.

112
00:11:19,545 --> 00:11:25,313
"When these four things
strange occur as one...

113
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:29,514
"The True King of France
shall return with the sun.

114
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:34,454
"Restore then to France
her former glory.

115
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:39,487
And this, kind sirs
is the end of our stop."

116
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:44,498
Hey! Hey! Cut
it out! Stop it!

117
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:50,504
- The movie's just beginning.
- "The King of France returns."

118
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,274
- What's that got to do with us?
- Hmm. Behold.

119
00:11:54,313 --> 00:11:57,305
The future king of France.

120
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,442
Professor...

121
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:03,421
- It's... it's me!
- Yes, it's you!

122
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:07,256
Just think of it.
It's incredible.

123
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:12,286
It's unbelievable. It's
frightening, but true. True!

124
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,299
With you on the
throne of France...

125
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:18,462
I'll have the means to unleash
my killer tomatoes on mankind!

126
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,408
Hit the brakes!

127
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:26,411
Hit the brakes!

128
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:31,249
Ow! Ohh! Ow!

129
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,251
I had the double
cheeseburger.

130
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,344
Lunch. Excellent.

131
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:37,355
Hey, who got into
my fries, huh?

132
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:42,258
You still owe me 3.77,
Shoelace Face.

133
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,286
Hey, I paid...
watch that.

134
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:48,424
- Mmm. Needs ketchup.
- Hey!

135
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,494
Nothing personal.

136
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:55,371
But, Professor, this
stums pretty far out.

137
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:59,502
Red streets, rivers that don't
flow, black sky, Underworld.

138
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,311
- What makes you think all this'll come true?
- Don't worry about it.

139
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,477
Leave that to us.

140
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,497
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
That's a tomato!

141
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,227
- For crying out loud.
- Oui.

142
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:29,502
- We what?
- What we have here is a failure to communicate.

143
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,211
Yeah, I'll say. You don't just wave
to a tomato. How do you know?

144
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,305
In France, we do not discriminate
against harmless vegetables.

145
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:38,350
Tomatoes are welcome here.

146
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:41,319
Don't get the wrong idea, ok? Some
of my best friends are tomatoes.

147
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,447
It's just that killer tomatoes
are dangerous. Period.

148
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,324
In France, we call
tomatoes "love apples."

149
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,454
And love is something
we French know, yes?

150
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:55,524
No... uh, yes. Sure.

151
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:59,533
Louie, this could be the beginning
of a beautiful friendship.

152
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:02,240
- Michael.
- Pardon?

153
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,300
That's my name... Michael.
You just called me Louie.

154
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:10,314
Yes, I know. Only
the farmers win.

155
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:15,385
Yeah. Sure. Your
English is unusual.

156
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,221
Merci. I learn by watching
American movies.

157
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,250
Romantic ones like
Casablanca, Cool Hand Luke...

158
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:25,286
The Magnificent Seven.

159
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:27,492
Have you seen Chinatown?
It's my favorite.

160
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:32,368
Chinatown "My sister! My daughter!
My sister! My daughter!

161
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:36,431
Mad! My sister and
my daughter! Oui?

162
00:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,375
Yeah. I guess
you've seen it.

163
00:14:39,445 --> 00:14:42,278
But I have a question.

164
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:47,251
Why do Americans always wait until the
middle of the movie to fall madly in love?

165
00:14:47,319 --> 00:14:49,310
Why not at first sight?

166
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,482
Stupid Americans?

167
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,378
Hey, what are you doing
with that thing, boss?

168
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:32,424
It ain't no killer tomato.
It ain't got no teeth!

169
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,518
Just watch, boys.

170
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,464
Just watch.

171
00:16:42,301 --> 00:16:45,395
Ah! Oh, needles!

172
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:01,351
Stand back!

173
00:17:02,554 --> 00:17:05,387
I have created...

174
00:17:05,424 --> 00:17:07,517
You created a mess!

175
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,285
- That's what you created!
- Shut up!

176
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,459
- I am missing the mutant gene.
- I'll say.

177
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:18,299
One ingredient that keeps
me from total success.

178
00:17:18,337 --> 00:17:23,297
I created it once quite by
accident when I made that... ah...

179
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,468
When I made
that... ah-choo!

180
00:17:25,511 --> 00:17:27,479
Yeah. When you
made Fuzzy Tomato.

181
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,415
That lousy little furball ain't gonna
stop us this time! Right, boss?

182
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:35,317
Zoltan, you must find FT.

183
00:17:35,354 --> 00:17:38,414
That double-crossing do-gooder
holds the key to our success!

184
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:42,392
- FT! FT!
- FT!

185
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:47,297
- I will disgrace you and destroy you!
- Yeah!

186
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:50,267
And conquer the
world in the bargain.

187
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,271
So... fly, my beauties.

188
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:58,436
Fly. Find Fuzzy Tomato,
the ruby mutant!

189
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,377
- We don't fly, boss! We bounce!
- Yeah.

190
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,280
It's a figure of speech,
nimrod. Get out of here!

191
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,477
Ohh! Ohh!

192
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,310
My mother is
named Marie also.

193
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:45,448
My father is Francois. But
everyone calls him Frenchy.

194
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,463
Say, I'd like...

195
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,363
Uh...

196
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:10,438
Electricity. It has
changed everything.

197
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,342
Oh, no, no, no. I...
I couldn't. Please.

198
00:19:14,386 --> 00:19:17,514
I... could, I
guess. Just a...

199
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,248
Little bit there.

200
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,426
Escargot. You like?

201
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,481
Escargot du sushi.
Nouvelle cuisine.

202
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:10,407
- Bonsoir.
- It is not the escaped prisoner!

203
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:12,410
It is Frenchy!

204
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,504
Marie, your beau is here.

205
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:20,411
Beau? Marie, I didn't know you
have a beau... fr... a boyfriend.

206
00:20:24,356 --> 00:20:27,257
Oh, Marie.

207
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,285
That is my sister,
also named Marie.

208
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:35,323
Now you know the
truth. I am so ashamed.

209
00:20:35,367 --> 00:20:38,336
Don't be silly. There's
no need to be ashamed.

210
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:44,240
- Just because your sister...
- Is beautiful! Go on! Run to her! They all do.

211
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,268
I lied when I told
you I was beautiful.

212
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,315
I hoped you were blinded
by the sand in your eyes.

213
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,476
Who am I kidding?
I am a beast!

214
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:57,454
Why I can't look like
a real French woman?

215
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,253
Oh, Frenchy!

216
00:21:04,496 --> 00:21:07,465
Damn! I hate these
open beam ceilings.

217
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:22,504
I eat all the time, but
I never gain weight.

218
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,513
I am doomed forever to have a
tiny waist and a petite derriere.

219
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:29,520
I am the most unluckiest
person in the whole world.

220
00:21:30,255 --> 00:21:35,420
Yeah. But there's more to life
than mere physical beauty.

221
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:40,363
Michael, you are so
kind, so thoughtful.

222
00:21:40,399 --> 00:21:43,368
Are all American men
as sensitive as you?

223
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,370
Well...

224
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,372
Yes.

225
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,374
Please, take me with you.

226
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:52,241
- To Paris? You and me?
- Help!

227
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:55,405
- Oui, I will show you the sights. Please.
- Help!

228
00:21:55,447 --> 00:21:59,315
We will drink wine,
talk and hold hands...

229
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:03,218
Talk, share
laughter and talk.

230
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:05,347
I don't know. I'm
not much of a talker.

231
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:09,326
And then we shall make wild,
passionate love under "ze" windmills.

232
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:13,229
Windmills? I
love miniature golf.

233
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:18,395
Yeah. It's the best thing since
electricity. We call it gasoline.

234
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:23,397
We are simple French county folk.
This gasoline, we do not know.

235
00:22:23,475 --> 00:22:28,435
A rich American like you must think us very
quaint. What is it like being a big movie star?

236
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:32,314
Oh, it's not easy. You have to
sift through script after script...

237
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:34,443
Until you find
just the right one.

238
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:38,387
- Hyah!
- Michael! Look at that big, black thing!

239
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:42,257
- We must be getting near Paris!
- Hyah! Hyah!

240
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:51,400
That is, of course, a big
square and round thing...

241
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:55,463
Built by someone to
remember something sometime.

242
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:00,500
Ah, the famous
left Bank of Paris.

243
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,238
That is a big, tall building with
lots of knick-knacks and stuff.

244
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,274
It's almost finished.

245
00:23:08,353 --> 00:23:10,446
This is Napoleon's Tomb.

246
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:14,391
Oh, now wait just a doggone minute here.
This is the Sphinx, and it's in Egypt.

247
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,486
You've never even been to Paris,
have you? What's this? Old Faithful?

248
00:23:19,264 --> 00:23:23,291
No. This is the Waters
of Life. I am sorry.

249
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:27,465
- You must think I am a
stupid, skinny peasant girl.
- No! No! No! Heck no.

250
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,270
I... I think you're the
kind of girl a guy could...

251
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:35,503
- Um, a guy could...
- Yes?

252
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,479
- Say, what is this place?
- It is a famous Paris attraction.

253
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:44,279
It is a recreation of an authentic
American shopping center.

254
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:47,450
Oh, great. That's just what I came to
France to see, another faceless mall.

255
00:23:47,492 --> 00:23:50,359
No. Not another
faceless mall.

256
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:54,331
But a genuine replica of San
Diego's magnificent Horton Plaza.

257
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:57,459
One hundred and fifty-one
specialty stores and restaurants...

258
00:23:57,502 --> 00:24:00,300
For your shopping
convenience.

259
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:01,339
Hearye! Hearye!

260
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,440
Hearye! Hearye!

261
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,499
Michael, look!

262
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:14,383
Michael, look. The
stone in the shoe.

263
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,387
- The stone in the shoe?
- Shh.

264
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:18,389
Hearye! Hearye!

265
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:20,516
Mesdames et monsieurs.

266
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:26,224
According to legend...

267
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:31,326
She who takes five paces
in the magic shoe...

268
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:35,271
Is the true
queen of France.

269
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:43,442
She's even thinner
than me. What a dog!

270
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,245
Regular Quasimodo.

271
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,451
Un...

272
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:03,496
- Deux...
- Ow!

273
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,438
Trois...

274
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:10,270
She's going to make it!

275
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,472
Go, Marie! Go!

276
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,376
Ow! Ow! Ow!

277
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,261
Boo!

278
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,388
Take a hike, bimbo!

279
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:34,398
Ow! Ohh! Ooh!

280
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,457
What's the deal?

281
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:41,336
It's the curse of my county. Our
revolution was a big mistake.

282
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:44,365
Now we have no
king, no royalty...

283
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:49,369
- No Charles, no Di, no Fergie,
no Stephanie, no Kennedys.
- Ow!

284
00:25:49,447 --> 00:25:53,383
But someday, someday
that will change.

285
00:25:53,451 --> 00:25:55,510
France will once
again be famous!

286
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,313
We will have our own
trashy tabloids...

287
00:25:58,356 --> 00:26:00,324
Our own sordid scandals.

288
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:04,328
- Vive la France!
- Vive la France!

289
00:26:04,362 --> 00:26:07,331
Michael, look!

290
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:13,498
"Tonight only! The FT
Up With Tomatoes Concert.

291
00:26:14,272 --> 00:26:17,298
A benefit for the Human/Vegetables
Brotherhood foundation."

292
00:26:17,342 --> 00:26:20,277
- Wow.
- Le Tomato Fuzzy, my favorite rock star.

293
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:22,280
He's bigger
than Jerry Lewis.

294
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:25,511
Old FT's done pretty good for
himself. I haven't seen him in ages.

295
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,546
You know le Tomato Fuzzy?

296
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:32,349
Oh, yeah, sure. FT and I,
we went to college together.

297
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:37,293
Please, Michael, take me to the Louvre tonight.
I'd love to see the concert and meet FT.

298
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:42,289
- For you, baby, anything.
- Great! I need a new dress!

299
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,477
Let's see. This
is 43. This is us.

300
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,485
Ladies and gentlemen, the
Louvre is proud to present...

301
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,351
Rock and roll's most
sensitive superstar...

302
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:13,296
That lovable liberal,
Fuzzy Tomato!

303
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:29,380
# Up with tomatoes
and up with people too #

304
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:32,247
# You know and I know #

305
00:27:32,283 --> 00:27:35,377
# It's the right thing to do #

306
00:27:35,453 --> 00:27:41,358
# We should learn from
children the proper way to play #

307
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,361
# Then together #

308
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,330
# We can have a
really nice day #

309
00:27:46,364 --> 00:27:49,333
# No hate, no war #

310
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,268
# No ethnic strife #

311
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:56,330
# In the age of Aquarius #

312
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:59,275
# It's a garden of life #

313
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,404
# Come on men
and wo-persons #

314
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:05,382
# Join this
uplifting ballad #

315
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:08,477
# Because we're all
important parts #

316
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,454
# Of life's tasty salad #

317
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,457
# We are the world #

318
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:18,258
# We are the seedlings #

319
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:23,290
# Our hope and our
faith have no ceilings #

320
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,531
# Black and white
red and green #

321
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:29,467
# Together as one #

322
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:32,499
# We get love
from the Earth #

323
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:37,237
# And strength
from the sun #

324
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:40,308
# Ooh, ooh, ooh #

325
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,418
Bravo!

326
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,257
C'est magnifique!

327
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:55,323
FT is an inspiration to men
and wo-persons everywhere.

328
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,335
FT will return after
a short intermission.

329
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,441
FT is so P.C.

330
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:06,376
You're knocking 'em dead.
You're mutilating 'em.

331
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:09,311
You got a press pass to have
that thing in here? One of these?

332
00:29:09,347 --> 00:29:12,282
- A rockumentary? Oh, well...
- You're decimating them. You're drowning them.

333
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,285
You're boiling them in
oil. Am I right, babe?

334
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:17,288
You're chopping them up into
teeny-weenie, tiny little pieces...

335
00:29:17,322 --> 00:29:19,415
So that their guts
are hanging outside.

336
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:22,255
- Get that for me, would you, Marie?
- Oh, lunch?

337
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,420
- FT, Madonna is on the telephone.
- Madonna who?

338
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:28,330
- Who is it?
- Sacre bleu! It is Santa Claus!

339
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,458
- Ha, ha, ha!
- Ho, ho, ho.

340
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,335
Right. Ho, ho, ho.

341
00:29:33,404 --> 00:29:36,373
Santa, baby.
We're a little busy.

342
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:39,343
The Toys for Tots gig isn't for
another six months, right, kiddo?

343
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:43,437
Well, in that case, we'll just leave
these little baubles right here!

344
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,252
Whoa!

345
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,365
Help! H-Help!

346
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,437
You'll never work in
show business again!

347
00:30:17,515 --> 00:30:20,245
You're gonna find yourself
in a Caesar Salad!

348
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:26,287
Get your FT souvenirs!
French fries!

349
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:30,260
Get your apple pie a la
mode! Get it while it's hot!

350
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,286
Let's hear it
again for FT!

351
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:35,491
Yeah! Whoo!

352
00:30:41,272 --> 00:30:43,331
Yeah!

353
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,478
# Violets are blue and
tomatoes are red #

354
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:56,248
# We'll stomp
on your feet #

355
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,414
# And knock
off your head #

356
00:30:58,456 --> 00:31:01,289
# My name's FT and
I'm red and I'm rad #

357
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,419
# Of the funky French culture
I'm sick and I'm mad #

358
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:06,327
# Enough of these gigs
now listen, you frogs #

359
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,389
# Your right's for the pigs and
your food's for the dogs #

360
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,264
# Death and destruction #

361
00:31:11,302 --> 00:31:13,395
# That be our plan #

362
00:31:13,471 --> 00:31:16,235
# Tomatoes forever #

363
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:18,401
# Down with the man #

364
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:21,241
# Au revoir, Renoir
this Vincent can Gogh #

365
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:24,304
# Say goodbye, adieu
Michelangelo #

366
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:51,498
Whoo! Ha, ha!

367
00:31:57,482 --> 00:32:00,212
Something is
very wrong here.

368
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,490
Michael, what's happening?

369
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:27,402
I know FT! I've
partied with FT!

370
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:32,212
And let me tell
you, you're no FT!

371
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,511
Wait a minute!
Listen to me!

372
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:40,315
That's not FT!

373
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:47,262
- Come on, Marie! Let's get out of here!
- Michael! Michael!

374
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:50,392
Get the tomato lover!
Kill the tomato lover!

375
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:53,495
He's a lover of tomatoes!

376
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,263
Kill him! Kick
him in the head!

377
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,434
Do anything! Just
get the tomato lover!

378
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:03,469
You have to kill him! Get
him! Get them! Oh, my god!

379
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:09,351
How you feelin',
little furball?

380
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:12,287
So, my fuzzy friend,
we meet again.

381
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,350
For the first time in memory,
it's a pleasure to see you.

382
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:20,363
- Ah... choo!
- Oh, geez, you son of a...

383
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:24,459
Excuse me. Is this
the castle gift shop?

384
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:28,302
- Third door down the hall.
Special on slides today.
- Get out of here!

385
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,308
- Move it!
- Help me, grandma!
Come here! Wait a minute!

386
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:37,280
And now we come to the
entertainment part of our program.

387
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:42,251
Igor, throw
the... ah... ah...

388
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,345
Throw the... throw
the... throw the...

389
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:46,481
Baseball?
Football? Discus?

390
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:49,493
Uh, lawn mower?
Start the lawn mower?

391
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:53,458
- Bless you!
- Throw the switch, you chowderhead!

392
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:58,264
I must be allergic to
this overripe furball.

393
00:34:10,281 --> 00:34:12,340
Yes! Yes! Yes!

394
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,476
Merci for your
generous donation.

395
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,520
You have no idea how
much it means to me.

396
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:19,280
Igor, show our guest
to the penthouse.

397
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,291
I may have need
of him later.

398
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,318
We don't have a penthouse, sir.
All we have is this really high
tower with bars on the windows.

399
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:29,459
Well, gee, I guess that'll have
to do. Must I be so literal?

400
00:34:32,503 --> 00:34:35,370
"The streets run red"
saith the prophecy.

401
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:40,309
They shall, indeed, before you
can say, "tomato surprise."

402
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,369
Yes!

403
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:57,461
Kill the tomato lovers!

404
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,499
Now that was close. I told you
tomatoes can be dangerous.

405
00:35:03,234 --> 00:35:04,496
You said yourself
that was not the real FT!

406
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,498
Yeah. But the whole
place went crazy.

407
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:10,435
It was the impostor that started it!
We must find FT and rescue him...

408
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:12,476
Explaining what really
happened or else...

409
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:15,341
Or else you're gonna have another
French Revolution on your hands.

410
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,507
The garden variety.

411
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,491
All right. I'll bite.
Where are we?

412
00:35:27,525 --> 00:35:33,259
The Tomato Quarter. The roughest,
most dangerous part of Paris.

413
00:35:33,331 --> 00:35:36,357
If FT was kidnapped, they would
maybe bring him here, yes?

414
00:35:36,434 --> 00:35:41,497
Did you say dangerous? You know, FT
and I aren't exactly what I'd call close.

415
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,367
Uh, actually, it's
pretty casual.

416
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:48,276
Certainly a brave, handsome
American like you is not afraid.

417
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,371
Afraid? Moi?

418
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:54,316
- I am not afraid.
- Good. Come on.

419
00:35:54,352 --> 00:35:56,320
A little cautious, maybe.

420
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,378
Prudent. Careful.
These are good words.

421
00:35:58,456 --> 00:36:00,424
Petrified. It's a
good one too.

422
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:02,426
Whoa!

423
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,351
They look pretty vicious. Of
course, on the other hand...

424
00:36:05,396 --> 00:36:08,365
They're now roused to a state of intense
anger which is liable to explode any minute.

425
00:36:08,399 --> 00:36:10,458
Michael, over there.

426
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,370
Oui. Oui.

427
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,441
This is a very famous
French vegetable café.

428
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:32,279
Two more straws?

429
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:34,382
Maybe she knows
something, yes?

430
00:36:34,458 --> 00:36:36,449
I'll be with you
in a minute.

431
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,361
Hey, you fruit!
Get out of here!

432
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,490
This is not that kind
of a bar! Allez! Allez!

433
00:36:45,403 --> 00:36:49,339
Oh, mama. Get this.

434
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:52,365
Bonjour, madame.
Et bonjour, monsieur.

435
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:56,243
Welcome to the
French... Kiss.

436
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:00,341
What will it be, "ze",
uh, house specialty?

437
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:05,319
Uh... perhaps you heard about
the riot tonight at the Louvre?

438
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:09,224
- Oui. What of it?
- Le Tomato Fuzzy was kidnapped!

439
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,457
- No! Then that explains it!
- Explains what?

440
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:17,456
Over there. Look slowly.

441
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:22,234
The fat one, he
has the hots forme.

442
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:26,265
- He calls himself Zoltan.
- Hey, baby, what's happening?

443
00:37:26,344 --> 00:37:30,303
He is disgusting!

444
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,407
They all are!

445
00:37:32,483 --> 00:37:37,386
He gave me a
Christmas present. Ha!

446
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,514
A fur coat!

447
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,453
Hmm. A cheap
gift. Kind of small.

448
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:46,326
Look! A zipper! It's
the FT disguise!

449
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,265
What furcoat has
a zipper? Eh?

450
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:53,396
- Pig!
- That's mr. Pig to you.

451
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:58,272
They invited me
to their pad.

452
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:03,244
"Igor's Really Big Castle
Tour. Real cheap."

453
00:38:03,314 --> 00:38:06,306
That really big castle
looks a little familiar.

454
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,511
Yeah. It looks a lot like the one
that's up the street from your house.

455
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:11,419
Of course! That's where
I've seen it! I will call a cab!

456
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,322
Taxi! Taxi!

457
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:17,452
Take me with you.
I am mad for you!

458
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:20,464
I will show you the
sights of Paris.

459
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,398
Wait a minute. Wait. I'm not
gonna fall for that line again.

460
00:38:23,434 --> 00:38:25,425
Besides, I've got
a girlfriend, Marie.

461
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,437
How did you know my name?

462
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:32,272
Don't you know the only thing better
than one French girl is two French girls.

463
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:35,312
- Ménage à trois.
- Oh, ménage à trois.

464
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,373
I thought that was when
you use both hands.

465
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,418
- Man, I'm one stewed tomato.
- Aw, don't be.

466
00:39:11,449 --> 00:39:13,474
Michael, this was
a great idea.

467
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:16,481
These disguises are much
better than everyone else's.

468
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,455
Yeah. We're the
life of the party.

469
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:23,392
Just try not to attract
any attention, ok?

470
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:35,397
Igor's Really Big Castle.

471
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:38,465
Ohh!

472
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,356
Over here.

473
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,520
You see that? I think that's
the main entrance.

474
00:39:58,262 --> 00:40:00,321
- Ooh.
- Come on.

475
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:19,448
Now think. Where
would they hide FT?

476
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:21,451
I do not know.
In "ze" garage?

477
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:23,476
No. This is a castle. It
doesn't have a garage.

478
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,489
- "Ze" rec room?
- No.

479
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:29,351
"Ze" family room? "Ze"
kitchenette? "Ze" dungeon?

480
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:32,362
"Ze" dungeon! Of course.

481
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:36,493
Now come on, everybody!

482
00:40:36,534 --> 00:40:40,368
Come on! Now, mrs. Brubaker,
don't you lean on that banister.

483
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,429
We've got a schedule
to maintain.

484
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:46,307
Only 246 more
rooms to go, ok?

485
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:49,369
- Poor souls.
- Thank you, sir.

486
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,472
There's nothing we can
do for 'em now. Come on.

487
00:40:51,549 --> 00:40:54,382
Let's find that dungeon.

488
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,368
Psst! FT?

489
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:15,338
FT, are you down here?

490
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:18,273
What is this place?

491
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,413
- Maybe a weight loss clinic?
- Michael, look!

492
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:32,479
"Property of prison library.
Severe fine for removal!"

493
00:41:32,523 --> 00:41:35,458
That looks like
the royal seal.

494
00:41:37,461 --> 00:41:41,397
Crown Books. This is
the real McCoy, all right.

495
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,366
"The Prophecy
of Nicodemus"?

496
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:50,430
"When the streets of Paris
shall run bright red.

497
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,306
"Then now not
the Waters of life...

498
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:57,280
"Be thee cold and dead.

499
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:01,375
"Be azure skies turned
black as night unfurled.

500
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:07,288
"Where a weeping virgin stands
watch o'er the Underworld.

501
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:10,259
"When these four
things occur as one...

502
00:42:10,294 --> 00:42:14,321
"The True King of France
shall return with the sun.

503
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:17,458
"Restore then to France
her former glory.

504
00:42:17,501 --> 00:42:22,268
And this, kind sirs
is the end of our stop."

505
00:42:22,306 --> 00:42:25,241
Hey, who turned
out the lights?

506
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:27,277
Will you stop that?

507
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:30,474
Michael, if this prophecy
comes true, France is saved.

508
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,278
We will have a king again.

509
00:42:33,317 --> 00:42:35,285
Marie, I wouldn't get
your hopes up too high.

510
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,311
A lot of weird stuff
has to happen first.

511
00:42:38,355 --> 00:42:41,415
Besides, we came
here to find FT.

512
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,325
We don't have
time for fairy tales.

513
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:48,354
Where is that
little fuzzy tomato?

514
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,525
Ah, "ze" king.

515
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:56,296
He is so strong,
so handsome.

516
00:42:57,474 --> 00:43:02,309
But you are right. Fairy
tales are for children.

517
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:05,372
Hey, let's split up. You'll take the
east wing. I'll take the west wing.

518
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,316
We'll cover more
ground. Ok? Let's go.

519
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,511
That looks just
like the guy...

520
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,515
Nah.

521
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:23,424
FT? FT?

522
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:27,362
I've looked everywhere.

523
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:34,210
FT!

524
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:37,304
Shh!

525
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:46,514
"Visit the Tower
of 900 Steps."

526
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,316
900 steps?

527
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,408
# Pass it around #

528
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,343
# 33 bottles of
beer on the wall #

529
00:44:08,379 --> 00:44:11,314
# 33 bottles of
beer on the wall #

530
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:14,317
# 33 bottles of beer #

531
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:21,484
"Ze" king of France?

532
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:24,359
Is it really you?

533
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,386
Yeah. I'm me, all right.

534
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,431
Oh, lord.

535
00:44:28,432 --> 00:44:33,335
This is a great day for France.
Wait until Michael sees you.

536
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:38,397
Eight hundred
ninety-eight, 899, 900.

537
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,467
Attention. Attention.

538
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,503
Will Michael J. Fox please
report to the dungeon?

539
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:48,513
Will Michael J. Fox please report to the
dungeon on the double? Thank you.

540
00:44:49,253 --> 00:44:53,383
Eight hundred and
ninety-nine, 898, 897...

541
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:59,293
Hey, now, a six of
hearts. Six of hearts. Oh.

542
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,392
- This better be important.
- Michael, look.

543
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:11,339
I know you. That balloon.

544
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:13,376
You're the guy.
You're the...

545
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:16,311
King of France! The
monarchy is saved.

546
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,348
You don't understand.
This guy is...

547
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:22,318
Quite accurate with a sandbag
if I recall. Isn't that right, boys?

548
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:26,254
- Right, boss.
- Hangover.

549
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:28,383
You kidnapped FT.

550
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,450
You are behind all this.

551
00:45:30,494 --> 00:45:35,295
Quite right. And now, without further
adieu, it's time to say au revoir.

552
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:38,334
- Marie, you've done well.
- Marie?

553
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:40,359
- Igor!
- How could you?

554
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,372
Michael, you
don't understand!

555
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:47,243
Don't look.

556
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,351
Thank you, my dear. Your assistance
has been greatly appreciated.

557
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:59,446
Show the lady to
the penthouse, Igor.

558
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:01,458
That's king Igor.

559
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:04,359
Not yet, you blundering
blockhead! Move your royal rump!

560
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,488
Michael! What have you
done to him, you monster?

561
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:13,293
Let's just say he checked out
on page 43. Read your script.

562
00:46:13,337 --> 00:46:15,305
Hey, I didn't
get a script.

563
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:18,308
"Michael is killed in the
Basement of Death?"

564
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:21,243
Ohh!

565
00:46:24,515 --> 00:46:28,451
Yes. The horrible
Basement of Death.

566
00:46:35,526 --> 00:46:38,290
This is a basement.

567
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:46,292
I'm not impressed!

568
00:46:58,282 --> 00:47:01,251
No! He washed the
colors with the whites!

569
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,418
Garage door opener.

570
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:14,294
Wait a minute. This is a castle.
It doesn't have a garage!

571
00:47:33,383 --> 00:47:36,352
I'm impressed!
I'm impressed!

572
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:48,490
"Michael is killed in the
Basement of Death"? I die?

573
00:47:48,532 --> 00:47:51,433
On page 43? This sucks!

574
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,213
No, Chuck! Not this time!

575
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:05,373
Fly me to France coach, they
put me up in a one star hotel.

576
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:07,474
It doesn't even have a drinking
fountain in the bathroom.

577
00:48:07,517 --> 00:48:10,247
- Like I need this?
- Can he do that?

578
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,379
I'll be in my trailer!

579
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:18,261
Marie's so pretty, she thinks she can
wrap me around her little finger.

580
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,388
"Michael, look. I will show you
the sights." Typical female.

581
00:48:21,431 --> 00:48:24,491
Oh, sure. Go ahead. Destroy
your life. Just remember.

582
00:48:24,534 --> 00:48:30,268
Those ruby lips and emerald eyes mask a
putrid suppurating, self-centered cynicism...

583
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:33,468
A nauseating, rotting, infectious mass
of decaying decadence buried in...

584
00:48:40,350 --> 00:48:46,311
And then the trap door flew open. And
my beloved Michael fell to his death...

585
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:52,394
Believing I had betrayed
our love. Oh.

586
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:58,229
I have nothing left
to live for. Nothing.

587
00:48:58,302 --> 00:49:00,463
Hey. Can I get
you an autograph?

588
00:49:00,504 --> 00:49:03,268
- You are very kind.
- Thank you.

589
00:49:03,307 --> 00:49:06,367
But an autographed poster
cannot bring back my beloved.

590
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,378
- Besides...
- Well, you never know.

591
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,437
- You are disgraced as well.
- What?

592
00:49:11,481 --> 00:49:14,416
Zoltan tricked the people into
thinking you destroyed the Louvre.

593
00:49:14,484 --> 00:49:19,217
- Me?
- The greatest work of
Michelangelo and Leonardo gone!

594
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,450
- Forever!
- Cowabunga?

595
00:49:21,491 --> 00:49:23,482
No. Not the Ninja Turtles!

596
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,495
The other Michelangelo
and Leonardo.

597
00:49:26,263 --> 00:49:28,254
Ah, phew!

598
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,357
The point is, neither
of us has any future.

599
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,235
- We might as well rot right here.
- No. Really? Come on. No.

600
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,502
All right, men, listen up.

601
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:43,372
Operation Tomato Storm begins
at zer 6:00 in the morning.

602
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:46,382
The target for
today, France.

603
00:49:46,450 --> 00:49:47,508
- Aah!
- Oui, oui.

604
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,481
Then we'll attack from
the north and the east.

605
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,518
From Hong Kong,
Guatemala, Australia...

606
00:49:54,257 --> 00:49:55,519
Igor, where'd you
get this map?

607
00:49:56,259 --> 00:49:58,489
It's official American
high school issue, sir.

608
00:49:58,528 --> 00:50:00,496
Next slide.

609
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,499
We'll hit 'em here...

610
00:50:04,501 --> 00:50:08,460
On the famous...
McEnroe Line.

611
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,501
Fire!

612
00:50:15,312 --> 00:50:18,475
- Let's see your backhand!
- Fire!

613
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,445
Run, you cowards! Run!

614
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:39,359
"Red Menace. Tomatoes
Marching Toward Paris!"

615
00:50:39,436 --> 00:50:43,338
Gangreen and that
blonde Benedict Arnold!

616
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,467
I wish I were dead.

617
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:50,377
"Join the Army. Learn electrical
engineering, quantum mechanics...

618
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,474
Molecular biology
and die like a man."

619
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:58,379
Sounds like a plan.

620
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,202
Vive la France!
Pour la bas!

621
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:20,433
War in Europe! For the
third time in this century...

622
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:25,312
The sounds of battle reverberate
across the muddy fields of France...

623
00:51:25,348 --> 00:51:27,475
As killer tomatoes
hurl themselves...

624
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:31,317
Against the well-entrenched
defenders of freedom.

625
00:51:51,408 --> 00:51:55,367
Dear Marie, you
subhuman scum.

626
00:51:58,381 --> 00:52:01,248
I am writing you this
letter from the front.

627
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:07,446
Your betrayal has broken my
heart and sapped my spirit.

628
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:11,325
Accordingly, I have
decided to die like a man.

629
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:17,262
Far from the allures
of perditious females.

630
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:24,465
By the time you read this,
I will, no doubt, be dead...

631
00:52:25,542 --> 00:52:29,376
Embracing the silent
sleep of the lovelorn.

632
00:52:35,452 --> 00:52:39,252
May your miserable life
be filled with failure.

633
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:44,452
Love, Michael.

634
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,507
Bernard, I'm coming to you live
from directly under my bed...

635
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:05,510
High atop the El Rajid
Holiday Inn here in Paris.

636
00:53:06,249 --> 00:53:07,511
- Killer tomatoes have been reported on...
- Igor!

637
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,414
- How's it coming?
- Great, Professor!
Three more tour groups signed up!

638
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,390
The war, you pointy-headed
mush for brains!

639
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:19,258
A... ok. Am I gonna
be king soon?

640
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,355
They're eating my microphone!
You can't do that!

641
00:53:21,431 --> 00:53:25,265
You can't eat me. I've got a
Pulitzer Prize. I've got a book deal.

642
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,430
"Dear Marie, you
subhuman scum."

643
00:54:01,504 --> 00:54:05,372
It's from Michael.
He's alive!

644
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,410
He's alive!

645
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:09,309
Cool.

646
00:54:09,346 --> 00:54:13,373
Oh, no. He's going
to kill himself.

647
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,283
I must find him,
tell him the truth!

648
00:54:18,388 --> 00:54:21,380
- FT, how can we escape?
- Beats me!

649
00:54:21,458 --> 00:54:24,393
Konnichiwa!
Bonjour! Hi there.

650
00:54:26,363 --> 00:54:29,355
You must help us! I am
Marie, and this is FT.

651
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:33,335
And we've been kidnapped by a mad
professor who controls the killer tomatoes!

652
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,394
And my love is going to kill
himself unless I can find him...

653
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,406
Because he thinks
I betrayed him!

654
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,273
And everyone thinks FT's
behind the revolution!

655
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:43,279
But he really is a friend of men
and wo-persons everywhere!

656
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:47,215
And unless we escape, France will
be ruled by a handsome imbecile...

657
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,445
And a bunch of
little red round things!

658
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,317
Hello!

659
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:00,329
FT! You can slip
through the bars!

660
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:02,331
Uh-uh! It's a long way.

661
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:05,266
I know it's a long way down. I
will make a rope from my dress.

662
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,270
No. This is
insane! No. No.

663
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:10,273
- FT, you are the last hope of France.
- Well...

664
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,365
- Find Michael. Give him my letter.
- No.

665
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:14,377
- Now, soar, like a bird.
- No.

666
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,504
No. I'm gettin'
out... No. No. No!

667
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:22,240
Ow!

668
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:30,385
I have an idea. Why don't
you make the rope longer?

669
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:33,487
I am sorry. This is a PG movie.
I cannot make the rope longer.

670
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,324
- Bazongas.
- Thank you.

671
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:40,461
36 "B" cup. Why?

672
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:44,496
Geronimo!

673
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:49,234
Go, FT!

674
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:52,247
Go!

675
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:55,445
Vive la France!
Pour la bas!

676
00:55:58,421 --> 00:56:03,484
- Fire!
- Voulez-vous couchez avec moi!

677
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:13,299
# Attack of the
killer tomatoes #

678
00:56:13,336 --> 00:56:15,497
- # Attack of the killer tomatoes #
- Fire!

679
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:20,265
# They'll beat you, bash you, squish you
mash you, chew you up for brunch #

680
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:23,245
# And finish you off
for dinner or lunch #

681
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:28,443
# They're marching
down the halls #

682
00:56:28,485 --> 00:56:30,419
# They're crawling
up the walls #

683
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,251
- Pass the mustard!
- Fire!

684
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:36,258
# They're gooey, gushy, squishy,
mushy rotten to the core #

685
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:40,228
Mustard gas!
Vegetables!

686
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,527
- # Attack of the killer tomatoes #
- Oh!

687
00:56:45,268 --> 00:56:48,533
# Attack of the
killer tomatoes #

688
00:56:49,272 --> 00:56:51,467
# They'll beat you, bash you, squish you
mash you, chew you up for brunch #

689
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:54,375
# And finish you off
for dinner or lunch #

690
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:59,348
# Lunch, lunch
dinner or lunch #

691
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:02,408
Look out!

692
00:57:06,389 --> 00:57:10,223
- Buddy, are you ok?
- "Zank" you. You saved my life.

693
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:13,387
It was nothing. Igor!

694
00:57:13,430 --> 00:57:18,231
No. I am Louis, but my
friends call me Frenchy.

695
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:21,270
And you, good sir,
are a true friend.

696
00:57:26,509 --> 00:57:31,242
You look just like...
oh, boy. The king!

697
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,511
You're the king! The prophecy
of Nicodemus! You're the guy!

698
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,512
You're the guy who's
supposed to save France!

699
00:57:36,252 --> 00:57:38,311
I know nothing
of any prophecy.

700
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,486
- Look! They are attacking!
- No, no!

701
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:46,251
Whoa! Hey!

702
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:49,231
FT, you're ok!

703
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,358
Chenin blanc!
Le tomato fuzzy!

704
00:57:51,434 --> 00:57:54,232
- The traitor!
- No, no! FT is a good guy.

705
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,272
It was an impostor that trashed
the Louvre. FT, meet the king.

706
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:58,500
- Hey, King!
- No, I am Frenchy.

707
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:01,305
Listen to me. If I
only had that book.

708
00:58:03,346 --> 00:58:05,314
Oh, wow. It's out
in paperback.

709
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,441
- Best seller.
- Here. Look.

710
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,281
Streets run red.
Waters don't flow.

711
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:13,312
Sun don't shine. Virgin
weeps. King comes back.

712
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,448
That's you.

713
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,326
No wonder my last
name is Seventeenth.

714
00:58:21,431 --> 00:58:23,490
- What?
- Letter.

715
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,438
"My darling, I did
not betray you.

716
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:32,407
"I was duped by Gangreen. I
am in the Tower of 900 Steps.

717
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,467
"Please rescue me at your
earliest possible convenience...

718
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:37,241
"So that we may stop
'ze' killer tomatoes...

719
00:58:37,313 --> 00:58:40,305
"Restore 'ze' throne,
and save France.

720
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:43,409
- Love, Marie."
- Aww.

721
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,222
Infrared glasses
for night vision.

722
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,259
Night vision? It's noon.

723
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:53,354
Oui. And precisely in one hour,
there will be a total eclipse of the sun.

724
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:58,492
The first time in France since 1553.
They may try a surprise attack.

725
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:00,497
Oh!

726
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,398
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

727
00:59:04,474 --> 00:59:06,465
Back fur...

728
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,512
Be azure skies turned
black as night unfurled.

729
00:59:10,246 --> 00:59:11,508
Azure means blue!

730
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,409
Blue skies.
Day into night!

731
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,418
The eclipse! Of
course! That's it!

732
00:59:16,452 --> 00:59:18,420
The prophecy... it's gonna
take place during the eclipse!

733
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:20,422
We've got to
stop Gangreen!

734
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:25,291
If he fulfills the prophecy before we
do, Igor becomes the king of France.

735
00:59:25,328 --> 00:59:28,422
- Not Igor!
- Igor? Who is "zis" Igor?

736
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:31,262
I'll explain it on the way to
The Really Big Castle. Let's go!

737
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:33,495
Let's go!

738
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:40,402
Whoa. Oh. Fresh
off the vine.

739
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,374
- Hey, who does his hair?
- Perfect!

740
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:52,249
Nice stems, sweetheart.

741
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:55,348
I think I have a
run in my stocking.

742
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:57,518
Oh! Never mind
runs in the stocking!

743
00:59:58,261 --> 01:00:00,456
- Runs!
- In an hour, France will be mine!

744
01:00:00,530 --> 01:00:02,498
- Yeah!
- You will claim the throne, surrender to Zoltan!

745
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:06,366
Europe will be at my feet.

746
01:00:06,402 --> 01:00:08,370
Great plan, peasant swine.

747
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:10,497
Hey, better hurry up! Things
are rough at the front.

748
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,435
Yeah! We're using
green recruits!

749
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,340
Yeah! We're
gettin' stomped!

750
01:00:20,416 --> 01:00:24,284
Not to worry, Zoltan!
Not to worry.

751
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:27,221
FT has solved the
problem for us.

752
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,451
Remember the mutant
gene we extracted?

753
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,460
Uh-oh.

754
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:39,391
Stand back!

755
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:43,234
- Wow! Déjà vu!
- Yeah.

756
01:01:01,457 --> 01:01:04,392
Huh, birth of a salad.

757
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,375
Oh!

758
01:01:20,443 --> 01:01:23,469
- Corner pocket.
- Oh.

759
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,481
Lift ticket.

760
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:47,368
Fifty mega-toms! Whoa!

761
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:51,464
Oh!

762
01:02:07,457 --> 01:02:10,517
- Well, what happens now?
- Yeah. What happens now?

763
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:13,455
Behold.

764
01:02:24,407 --> 01:02:26,375
I've done it!
I've done it!

765
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,505
I have created Tomato Head, the
world's first thermonuclear tomato.

766
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:35,206
Ooh, ooh, ooh!
50 mega-toms.

767
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:40,278
Equal to the destructive force
of 5.000 killer tomatoes. Yeah!

768
01:02:40,323 --> 01:02:42,382
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

769
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,393
Mamma mia. That's
some spicy "meatballa".

770
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:47,429
Yes, it is, isn't it?

771
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,265
Ok. Now,
there's the tower.

772
01:02:54,303 --> 01:02:57,272
You guys create a diversion, and
I go rescue Marie. Any questions?

773
01:02:57,306 --> 01:02:59,240
Bismarck?

774
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:01,435
Uh, no. The capital
of Idaho is Boise.

775
01:03:01,477 --> 01:03:03,445
- Let's go!
- Yeah!

776
01:03:03,513 --> 01:03:06,346
Doo doo-doo!

777
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,281
Cover me.

778
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:19,260
Eight, nine, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15...

779
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,355
121, 122, 123, 124,
125, 126, 127...

780
01:03:22,431 --> 01:03:26,231
441, 442, 443, 444,
445, 446...

781
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:29,465
712...

782
01:03:32,275 --> 01:03:34,243
713...

783
01:03:37,346 --> 01:03:39,314
FT, stop "zem", we must.

784
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,339
Look. Weapon!

785
01:03:43,386 --> 01:03:45,354
Do not touché.

786
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:47,356
Well, Louis, it
is an emergency.

787
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:50,290
You're right.

788
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:52,487
"Zis" is an emergency.

789
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:56,365
Halt, blackguards!

790
01:03:57,433 --> 01:03:59,492
Hey, Igor, where's
your king duds?

791
01:04:12,281 --> 01:04:16,285
En garde, you
handsome dog!

792
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,288
Hmm.

793
01:04:45,448 --> 01:04:47,507
Wow! Finally
something decent!

794
01:04:48,251 --> 01:04:49,513
This is better than
Universal Studios!

795
01:04:51,287 --> 01:04:55,383
So realistic too!

796
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,421
Ah, pardon me,
ladies and gentlemen.

797
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:04,433
Please step into this fine example
of a 16th century broom closet.

798
01:05:10,373 --> 01:05:12,307
Ho! Ho...

799
01:05:18,281 --> 01:05:21,250
Ok, footwork. Footwork. You
gotta use your right hand.

800
01:05:21,284 --> 01:05:24,412
The judges are gonna vote against
you. You gotta take him this round.

801
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:27,354
Don't forget.
Footwork. Footwork!

802
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,238
All right, that's a cut.
Reset, people. Back to one.

803
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:47,401
Art Department, will
you get on this wall?

804
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:49,434
Stay miked! Speed!
Action! Cut!

805
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:53,374
Back! Back!

806
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,509
Burn page 64! Burn it!

807
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:04,426
Ooh, ow! Ow! Ow!

808
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:23,404
You, sir, are my prisoner.

809
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:31,310
Uh-oh. Yo, boss man!

810
01:06:31,387 --> 01:06:35,255
There's someone climbing the steps to
the tower. He's gonna rescue the broad!

811
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,420
Not likely, Zoltan.
Not likely.

812
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:43,364
750, 751, 752...

813
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:59,476
755! 756! 757!

814
01:07:21,537 --> 01:07:25,405
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven...

815
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:27,409
You will never
get away with this...

816
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:30,378
Even if you place an impostor
on the throne of France!

817
01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:33,246
One look at my face will
unmask your fiendish plot.

818
01:07:33,282 --> 01:07:35,250
Did you say unmask?

819
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:37,275
Ooh, an unfortunate
choice of words...

820
01:07:37,319 --> 01:07:40,345
Because no one is ever
going to see your face again.

821
01:07:40,423 --> 01:07:43,290
Igor.

822
01:07:56,505 --> 01:08:00,464
Farewell, sweet prince.
Or whoever's in there.

823
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,273
My life means nothing.

824
01:08:03,312 --> 01:08:08,306
At this very moment, my brave
American friend is closing in on you.

825
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:11,217
I'm leaving a little
surprise for your friend.

826
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:14,381
As you've discovered, it's easier to
get into my castle than out of it. Viper!

827
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,450
- Yo!
- Have Tomato Head greet our guest in the lobby.

828
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:21,496
- Zoltan, report!
- Everything's set, boss.

829
01:08:21,530 --> 01:08:24,294
Total eclipse of the
sun in 26 minutes.

830
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:27,427
On to Paris! The
prophecy is at hand!

831
01:08:29,371 --> 01:08:31,339
So long, sucker.

832
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,341
Ciao, baby.

833
01:08:52,361 --> 01:08:56,229
17, 18...

834
01:09:04,373 --> 01:09:06,341
Skates? Oh, why did
it have to be skates?

835
01:09:10,279 --> 01:09:12,372
No!

836
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:17,509
Yah!

837
01:09:28,430 --> 01:09:30,398
Marie. Marie!

838
01:09:30,432 --> 01:09:33,230
Michael?

839
01:09:33,302 --> 01:09:35,361
Yes!

840
01:09:35,404 --> 01:09:38,464
- Ah!
- Hurry!

841
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,443
Ow! Oh! Ah! Ah!

842
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,471
I never thought
I'd see you again.

843
01:09:46,549 --> 01:09:48,517
Hey, you can't get
rid of me that easily.

844
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:52,248
- Then you don't hate me for what's happened?
- Hate you?

845
01:09:57,259 --> 01:09:58,521
Ow! Watch that speed bump.

846
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,320
Michael, look!

847
01:10:03,499 --> 01:10:05,467
Uh, fellas? Are
we there yet?

848
01:10:05,501 --> 01:10:08,334
Nothing like the
wind in my leaves!

849
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:11,339
Come on! We got to stop that
misogynistic misanthrope.

850
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:14,376
Oh, I love that
kind of talk.

851
01:10:14,410 --> 01:10:18,346
Heck, maybe Igor
would make an ok king.

852
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:20,382
Nah.

853
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:27,312
Michael, I thought
we were in a hurry!

854
01:10:30,326 --> 01:10:32,294
- Where's FT?
- He's with Louis.

855
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:34,455
- Who's Louis?
- I'll explain on the way down.

856
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:36,498
Come on!

857
01:10:39,368 --> 01:10:43,270
Hmm. Ok. Oh, oh!

858
01:10:44,373 --> 01:10:47,308
Oh, dungeon. Hmm, ok.

859
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,275
Louis!

860
01:10:52,314 --> 01:10:54,407
Ow! Ow!

861
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:57,317
Don't worry, Louis.
I'll save you.

862
01:11:01,357 --> 01:11:04,258
Ow! Ow!

863
01:11:13,302 --> 01:11:15,270
Ow! Ow! Ow!

864
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:28,339
# Wake up, Louis
and fight, fight, fight #

865
01:11:28,417 --> 01:11:32,376
# Charge that door
with all your might #

866
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:35,480
# Precious something
for you and me #

867
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:39,324
# Onward, Louis... #

868
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:42,296
Let me out! Get me
out of here, Louis!

869
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:45,459
Louis!

870
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:52,363
- Come, le Tomato Fuzzy!
We must save France!
- Yeah!

871
01:11:52,441 --> 01:11:54,500
So, you see, Louis
is the true king of France!

872
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:57,512
And we have to fulfill the prophecy
before they do, before the eclipse!

873
01:11:58,247 --> 01:11:59,509
- That's the whole story.
- Wow!

874
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:04,242
"Zat" is the second most
amazing story I've ever heard.

875
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,379
- Can't this thing go any faster?
- Be patient.

876
01:12:06,422 --> 01:12:09,357
We must take "zis"
one step at a time.

877
01:12:18,467 --> 01:12:22,494
Hot dog! Get your genuine
American hot dog!

878
01:12:23,272 --> 01:12:25,297
- Which way did they go?
- Who?

879
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,309
A madman in a white lab coat,
a prince in blue panty hose...

880
01:12:27,343 --> 01:12:29,470
And some vicious
red round things.

881
01:12:30,245 --> 01:12:31,507
Could you be
more specific?

882
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:34,238
Hey, Louis. Let's
get a hot dog, ok?

883
01:12:34,283 --> 01:12:37,343
- We do not have time for a hot dog.
- Hey, I made a plan.

884
01:12:37,419 --> 01:12:42,288
Ah. Uh, two polish
dogs and some fries.

885
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:46,317
- Fries? Foreign or domestic?
- Domestic, of course!

886
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,363
Let's go. Come on!

887
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:55,300
- Ok, I'll drive.
- Vive la France!

888
01:12:57,339 --> 01:12:59,398
Who was that masked man?

889
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:02,433
Onward, le Tomato Fuzzy!

890
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,309
Oh, my gosh.

891
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:14,422
What is it?

892
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:18,483
Well, it appears to be a giant, slobbering, somewhat
overweight tomato with a cape and mask.

893
01:13:19,261 --> 01:13:21,456
It's... it's Phantomato
of the Opera!

894
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:26,365
Back off. You overgrown
piece of produce!

895
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,370
Aah! Holy smoke!

896
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:30,372
Michael, do something!

897
01:13:30,406 --> 01:13:34,274
- W... w-w-weapon! I need a weapon!
- There!

898
01:13:34,309 --> 01:13:37,506
- I was thinking more along
the lines of a Patriot missile.
- Look!

899
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:39,542
Ah! Hah!

900
01:13:47,389 --> 01:13:50,290
Now, that was an
interesting diversion.

901
01:13:51,493 --> 01:13:54,462
Now, on to the
highlight of our tour...

902
01:13:54,496 --> 01:13:58,398
The Tower of 900 Steps.

903
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,403
900 steps? Oh!

904
01:14:03,338 --> 01:14:06,307
I'd like you to notice this
very large Elizabethan tapestry...

905
01:14:06,341 --> 01:14:08,309
Directly behind me.

906
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:12,279
And to my left is a Louis
XIV Stratolounger.

907
01:14:15,417 --> 01:14:18,352
And this is a giant,
fire-breathing tomato.

908
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,348
A giant, fire-breathing
tomato?

909
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,433
Damn! I'm out of film!

910
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:35,427
Go, go, go!

911
01:14:40,442 --> 01:14:42,410
- Got it.
- You got it?

912
01:14:42,444 --> 01:14:45,242
- Yes.
- All right.

913
01:14:47,483 --> 01:14:49,451
Ow!

914
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,312
All right! Now, I'll distract him
and you get out of here!

915
01:14:54,356 --> 01:14:57,382
- Oh, Michael! You'll get a medal for "zis"!
- Yeah, posthumously.

916
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,485
No, definitely!

917
01:15:12,241 --> 01:15:15,233
Huh?

918
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,354
Magnifique!

919
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:29,447
Simply brilliant!

920
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:34,520
Hey, we still have to find FT,
and we have to stop Gangreen.

921
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,526
We don't have time for
this. Come on! Let's go!

922
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:49,243
Ahh!

923
01:15:49,311 --> 01:15:51,279
Merde!

924
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,239
- These are my best shoes!
Genuine imported Cherokees!
- Don't worry about it.

925
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:58,480
You wouldn't by any chance be looking for
that man in the iron face mask, would you?

926
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:01,245
Iron face mask?
No. No, no.

927
01:16:01,290 --> 01:16:03,258
We're looking for a
little red fuzzball.

928
01:16:03,292 --> 01:16:05,260
A fuzzball? He
went that-a-way!

929
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,262
Thank you! Come on!

930
01:16:08,297 --> 01:16:10,390
Hey! Tell him he
owes me 3.50!

931
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:14,368
Uh, pardon me. The name's Bond,
James Bond. This is Brigitte Bardot.

932
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,404
We're on a mission
for the Secret Service.

933
01:16:16,438 --> 01:16:19,305
We need your motor vehicle.
Uh, have a nice day.

934
01:16:21,343 --> 01:16:24,403
I "zought" Sean
Connery was taller.

935
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:27,243
That was Roger
Moore, dummy.

936
01:16:27,282 --> 01:16:29,341
It looked like
Skippy to me.

937
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:32,410
Onward to glory,
my fuzzy friend!

938
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:38,289
Yes! The azure skies turned
black as night unfurled!

939
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:40,295
Yes!

940
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:43,396
Come on!

941
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:48,495
Citizens of France!
Victory or vichyssoise!

942
01:16:51,306 --> 01:16:53,274
Oh, can't this thing
go any faster?

943
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:56,368
- Shift gears or something!
- I am doing the best I can!

944
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,247
Hurry! Hurry!

945
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:07,414
- Uh-oh.
- Hey, boss, we got company.

946
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,391
Onward, le Tomato Fuzzy!

947
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:14,259
Gadzooks! Golden
gomer at 6:00, Igor!

948
01:17:14,329 --> 01:17:16,297
Make haste with the paste!

949
01:17:16,331 --> 01:17:18,265
Yeah! Let's
juice 'em, jack!

950
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:21,427
Hey, I can't see!

951
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,467
Watch where you are
going, le Tomato Fuzzy!

952
01:17:28,510 --> 01:17:31,343
Oh! Oh! Look out!

953
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:35,373
Look out, le Tomato Fuzzy!

954
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:47,387
Louis, are you hurt?

955
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:54,392
I am all right. Quickly, we must warn
"ze" people before it is too late.

956
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:59,237
- You are a mess. Ew!
- You are right. I am a mess.

957
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,299
Hand me "zat" costume!

958
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:08,278
Loyal subject,
we must fight!

959
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,251
Loyal subject,
we must help!

960
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,447
Loyal subject,
we must strike!

961
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:15,490
Tough crowd.

962
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,261
It's gotta be!

963
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:24,198
There they are! Hurry up!

964
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,235
- Onward, Igor!
- Go, go, go, go, go!

965
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:29,463
Destiny! Our destiny.

966
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:32,268
Yes!

967
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:41,339
All right, pull alongside!

968
01:18:42,451 --> 01:18:44,510
Give it up, you
garlic scum!

969
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:49,417
That's "Gallic" scum,
nimrod! Yah! Yah! Yah!

970
01:18:51,359 --> 01:18:52,519
- Hey, watch it!
- Ha!

971
01:18:57,399 --> 01:18:59,390
You can't win!

972
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:01,436
Don't you know good
always kicks evil's butt?

973
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:03,438
Wanna bet?

974
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:08,442
Slice and dice,
Igor! Yes!

975
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:13,440
Marie, look out!

976
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,450
She gets the point.

977
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:20,353
Fight! Fight!

978
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,356
Closer, you Teutonic twit!

979
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,359
Yes, yes, yes!

980
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,265
Oh, Professor, how
do we get out of here?

981
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:42,435
Bear right, you idiot!

982
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:48,416
Oh, street sweepers
coming through!

983
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:56,390
Juice 'em, Professor!

984
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:14,499
Ah. The streets of Paris
shall run bright red.

985
01:20:15,243 --> 01:20:17,268
The first part of the
prophecy is fulfilled!

986
01:20:17,345 --> 01:20:19,313
Three to go!

987
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,356
Oh!

988
01:20:30,425 --> 01:20:32,393
- Where'd they go?
- I don't know.

989
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:34,452
Oh, no! We're
running out of time!

990
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:37,488
- Think! Where could they have gone?
- Let me see.

991
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:41,366
Uh, streets run
red. No kidding.

992
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:43,404
Black skies. Ditto.

993
01:20:44,439 --> 01:20:47,203
Waters don't flow.
What does that mean?

994
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,244
"Ze" Waters of Life. "Ze" Waters of
Life. "Ze" fountain in the square.

995
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,280
The day we came to
buy it. Remember?

996
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:55,283
Right! They're gonna try and
stop the fountain! Let's go!

997
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,255
Sunglasses! Sunglasses
for the big eclipse!

998
01:21:01,289 --> 01:21:03,416
Get your sunglasses,
50 francs!

999
01:21:03,491 --> 01:21:06,426
- Sunglasses for you and the wife?
- Won't be necessary.

1000
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:10,420
Sure? Don't want to miss this one.
Won't be another like it for 300 years.

1001
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:13,490
- Thanks just the same.
- Ok, man. Suit yourself.

1002
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:16,402
Sunglasses! Sunglasses
for the big eclipse!

1003
01:21:20,408 --> 01:21:22,376
Which way?

1004
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:25,379
I don't know. Ask him!

1005
01:21:25,413 --> 01:21:28,246
Pardon moi. Which way
to the Waters of Life?

1006
01:21:28,316 --> 01:21:30,307
Oh, I'm not positive.

1007
01:21:30,352 --> 01:21:33,515
- But... but I've got a hunch.
- Thank you!

1008
01:21:39,261 --> 01:21:43,459
People of France, hear me!

1009
01:21:43,498 --> 01:21:45,489
I am the rightful king!

1010
01:21:45,533 --> 01:21:47,501
Igor is a fake!

1011
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,466
A charlatan Heston.

1012
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,343
- Who's that ringing in the Seine?
- Gene Kelly?

1013
01:21:56,411 --> 01:22:00,507
No! It's... it's Louis!

1014
01:22:02,350 --> 01:22:07,447
Hey, Louis! They're at the
Waters of Life! Come on!

1015
01:22:07,489 --> 01:22:10,481
We've gotta hurry!

1016
01:22:17,499 --> 01:22:21,492
Oh, wow. Pop a pair of Speedos on
that guy, he could be in the Olympics.

1017
01:22:23,538 --> 01:22:25,403
Come on!

1018
01:22:27,475 --> 01:22:29,500
Wait for me!

1019
01:22:39,254 --> 01:22:44,317
"Then now not the waters of
life... be they cold and dead."

1020
01:22:46,261 --> 01:22:48,491
One minute to
go. Come, come.

1021
01:22:48,530 --> 01:22:52,261
Strawberries!

1022
01:22:52,334 --> 01:22:57,237
Sunglasses! Cherries!

1023
01:22:58,340 --> 01:23:02,299
"Be azure skies turned
black as night unfurled...

1024
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:07,508
Where a weeping virgin stands
watch o'er the Underworld."

1025
01:23:08,249 --> 01:23:09,511
Wow, it's all coming true.

1026
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:13,448
But, Professor, where are we
gonna find a weeping virgin?

1027
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:19,484
Ow!

1028
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:23,526
"When these four things
strange occur as one...

1029
01:23:24,265 --> 01:23:28,224
Then the true king of France
shall return with the sun."

1030
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,272
Hey, I'm gonna be king.

1031
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:45,384
- Igor!
- Impostor!

1032
01:23:54,396 --> 01:23:58,355
People of France, who is
this insolent interloper?

1033
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:02,368
- This impostor? Who?
- I am "ze" king of France.

1034
01:24:02,404 --> 01:24:05,305
- I'm the king of France.
- Liar!

1035
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:12,438
Ow! Ow! Ow!

1036
01:24:12,514 --> 01:24:15,483
Ah. Ow!

1037
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,347
Hey! Hey, you can't do...

1038
01:24:23,391 --> 01:24:28,419
Oh, my god!
We have a queen!

1039
01:24:28,496 --> 01:24:30,464
Yeah!

1040
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:42,266
The queen! We
have a queen!

1041
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:48,247
Hear me!

1042
01:24:48,283 --> 01:24:52,379
The queen must choose
her king! It is written!

1043
01:24:55,390 --> 01:25:00,225
- But I do not want a king.
- Burn her!

1044
01:25:00,295 --> 01:25:03,355
- Burn her! Burn her!
- Off with her head!

1045
01:25:03,398 --> 01:25:08,461
But who am I to disregard
the will of the people?

1046
01:25:08,503 --> 01:25:11,472
Marie, you must choose!

1047
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:14,498
Yes. You must choose.

1048
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:31,258
Uh, sorry, Igor. It didn't work.
We've been discovered.

1049
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,352
I apologize to everyone.
This is the true king.

1050
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,465
It's Johnny...it's
Johnny Weissmuller!

1051
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,303
Igor!

1052
01:25:53,381 --> 01:25:56,441
My liege!

1053
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:08,485
- Come on, move it! Move it! Move it!
- Comin' through!

1054
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:11,294
Let's go, boys.
The party's over.

1055
01:26:22,310 --> 01:26:25,404
Whoo-hoo! Way to go!
Yeah! Whoo-hoo!

1056
01:26:56,511 --> 01:27:00,447
- Well, old buddy, I guess it's you and me.
- Aah!

1057
01:27:00,481 --> 01:27:04,349
It's better this way. Heck, she's
not my type anyway. Right?

1058
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:07,445
Yeah, she's bad for you.

1059
01:27:07,488 --> 01:27:11,254
Yeah. Who am I kiddin'?

1060
01:27:13,261 --> 01:27:15,354
Hey, come on. There's still
plenty more Europe to see.

1061
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:18,365
- Look. Guatemala's right around the corner.
- Ah, Guatemala.

1062
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:23,361
Good-bye, Michael J. Fox.

1063
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:26,498
I will always love you.

1064
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:30,439
But now, I
belong to France.

1065
01:27:34,282 --> 01:27:39,276
Loyal subjects, today is
a great day for France!

1066
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:42,414
Because nothing is
more romantic...

1067
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:46,517
More poignant, more profitable
"zan" a royal wedding.

1068
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:57,237
Except for a queen...

1069
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:02,436
Who abdicates her throne
for "ze" commoner she loves.

1070
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:05,241
Michael!

1071
01:28:08,449 --> 01:28:11,384
Michael! Michael!

1072
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:21,428
Michael! Michael!

1073
01:28:21,462 --> 01:28:24,295
- Marie!
- Oh, Marie.

1074
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:27,324
Look, I have to
level with you.

1075
01:28:27,402 --> 01:28:32,430
I'm not Michael J. Fox.
I'm not a big movie star.

1076
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:36,239
I'm more like a...
B movie star.

1077
01:28:36,277 --> 01:28:39,405
That's not important now.
What's important is I love you!

1078
01:28:39,447 --> 01:28:43,247
I love you more than any guy
has ever loved a girl in a movie!

1079
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:48,312
And, well, if it comes down
to me or the king of France...

1080
01:28:49,424 --> 01:28:52,325
Well, that's a
tough choice.

1081
01:28:52,360 --> 01:28:55,386
Maybe not so difficult as
you think, foreign peasant.

1082
01:29:01,502 --> 01:29:04,232
Oh, ho!

1083
01:29:04,305 --> 01:29:08,401
"Ze" queen is kissing a
commoner. She cannot do that.

1084
01:29:18,419 --> 01:29:21,286
Royal scandal!
Read all about it!

1085
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,416
Read about a
royal scandal!

1086
01:29:35,436 --> 01:29:39,497
And so they all lived happily
ever after. What a crock.

1087
01:29:40,274 --> 01:29:44,301
- Yeah!
- Wipe the sappy smiles off your faces, suckers!

1088
01:29:44,345 --> 01:29:47,314
While you were watching the
end of this stupid movie...

1089
01:29:47,348 --> 01:29:49,316
We paid a little visit
to the parking lot.

1090
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:55,482
Anybody like a good deal
on a slightly used Blaupunkt?

1091
01:29:59,260 --> 01:30:01,228
- I'll be back!
- Me too.

1092
01:30:01,262 --> 01:30:05,323
Yes, I will! Oh, yeah!

1093
01:30:06,501 --> 01:30:10,403
# Attack of the killer tomatoes #

1094
01:30:10,438 --> 01:30:12,406
- I'm Viper!
- I'm Ketchup!

1095
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,408
I just ate FT!

1096
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:16,534
# We'll beat you, bash you
squish you, mash you #

1097
01:30:17,278 --> 01:30:18,540
# Chew you up for brunch #

1098
01:30:19,280 --> 01:30:21,373
# And finish you off
for dinner or lunch #

1099
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,384
Or maybe a light snack.

1100
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,386
Or sliced over
breakfast cereal.

1101
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:27,388
Did you bring the
dental floss, Ketchup?

1102
01:30:27,422 --> 01:30:32,291
# We're marching
down the hall #

1103
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,328
Here we come.

1104
01:30:34,362 --> 01:30:37,229
Two hup, two
hup, two. Told ya.

1105
01:30:37,298 --> 01:30:40,324
# We're crawling
up your walls #

1106
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:42,529
It's not very attractive.

1107
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,533
A trail of goo.

1108
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:49,232
# We're gooey, gushy, squishy,
mushy rotten to the core #

1109
01:30:49,277 --> 01:30:52,246
- Speak for yourself.
- # We're standing outside your door #

1110
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:54,248
Just outside
the door, lady.

1111
01:30:54,282 --> 01:30:56,250
- Open up!
- Knock, knock!

1112
01:30:58,419 --> 01:31:01,252
Oh, forget it. Sing that
song you like so much.

1113
01:31:01,289 --> 01:31:03,348
No.

1114
01:31:03,391 --> 01:31:07,293
# Ninety-nine bottles of beer on the
wall, ninety-nine bottles of beer #

1115
01:31:07,328 --> 01:31:09,353
# You take one down
pass it around #

1116
01:31:09,430 --> 01:31:11,455
# Ninety-eight bottles
of beer on the wall #

1117
01:31:11,499 --> 01:31:14,468
# Ninety-eight- ninety-seven
bottles of ketchup on the wall #

1118
01:31:14,502 --> 01:31:17,471
- Ketchup, I got a good one.
- What?

1119
01:31:18,239 --> 01:31:21,333
# Row, row, row your
tomatoes gently down the #

1120
01:31:21,409 --> 01:31:24,344
Oh, I liked that. Ok,
where were we?

1121
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:26,505
# Ninety-seven bottles
of ketchup on the wall #

1122
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:29,341
# Ninety-seven bottles
of ketchup on the wall #

1123
01:31:29,417 --> 01:31:32,318
# Take one down
pass it around #

1124
01:31:32,353 --> 01:31:35,379
# You have a bunch of dead
tomatoes on the wall #

1125
01:31:35,423 --> 01:31:37,391
Forget it.

1126
01:33:14,422 --> 01:33:17,289
Hey, this is the
end of the movie!

1127
01:33:17,358 --> 01:33:19,326
- This isn't in my contract.
- Come on, you guys!

1128
01:33:19,360 --> 01:33:22,329
- Oh, hurtin'...
- Cut it of.

1129
01:33:22,363 --> 01:33:24,422
- It's all over. I'm trying to tell 'em.
- Hey!

1130
01:33:24,498 --> 01:33:28,264
I'm sorry to keep you here,
but... turn the thing off.
