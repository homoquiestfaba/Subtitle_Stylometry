1
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:35,968
The french, they have it
all figured out, right?

2
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,605
I read this article online,
actually an in-depth blog,

3
00:00:39,607 --> 00:00:42,041
and it was saying how
they consistently have better,

4
00:00:42,043 --> 00:00:44,476
more-fulfilling relationships
than americans

5
00:00:44,478 --> 00:00:47,046
because they aren't so...
so goal-oriented

6
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,914
when it comes to love.

7
00:00:48,916 --> 00:00:53,318
They don't judge a relationship
based on the final outcome.

8
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,921
They value the actual journey.

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,560
- Look, dude. You can't keep beating
yourself up over what happened.

10
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:02,928
-I broke up with her, jared.

11
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:04,563
-It's been over a year.

12
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,865
I give you permission to knock
the dust off your schvantz.

13
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,902
And now you speak yiddish?

14
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,637
- Motherfucker,
I was bar mitzvahed.

15
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:13,972
Shit, man.
At least you got that ring back.

16
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:15,808
That's pretty key.

17
00:01:18,211 --> 00:01:19,411
You didn't get the ring back.

18
00:01:19,413 --> 00:01:20,813
-I don't want to talk about it.

19
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:24,516
- Yeah.
- You're a disgrace.

20
00:01:24,518 --> 00:01:25,984
- Yeah,
I'm just getting warmed up.

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,660
Dude, come here.
Come here, come here.

22
00:01:34,662 --> 00:01:37,029
Check it out. Right there.

23
00:01:37,031 --> 00:01:39,598
She's checking you out.
She's checking you out.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Hey, go over there
and ask them to bowl with us.

25
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,435
-I'm... dude, no.

26
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,837
-Dude, would you...

27
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:46,038
s-she's checking you out again
a second time.

28
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,339
She checked you out again!

29
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,607
- She's scanning the room.
Just let it go.

30
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:50,042
- Dude,
she is not scanning the room.

31
00:01:50,044 --> 00:01:51,643
Dude, if you don't
go over there, I will.

32
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:52,945
Do it right now.
- I'm not... dude, stop it.

33
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:54,680
Let it go.
- No. Here she... here she comes.

34
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,014
- Are you serious?
- She's right...

35
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,683
- hey.
- Hey.

36
00:01:57,685 --> 00:02:00,419
- Um, I was just wondering if
you had an extra 12-pounder.

37
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:03,922
- Um, well,
I-I just have this one,

38
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:05,524
but we can share it if you want.

39
00:02:05,526 --> 00:02:06,725
Or you know what? Just take it.

40
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:08,293
-Oh. No, don't worry about it.

41
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:09,428
You're kind of on a roll here,
so...

42
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,996
- Thank you.

43
00:02:10,998 --> 00:02:12,965
- I'll look for another one.
It's fine.

44
00:02:12,967 --> 00:02:14,566
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

45
00:02:14,568 --> 00:02:15,701
Sorry. - Thank you.

46
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:16,903
- No, it's okay.
- Yeah, sorry.

47
00:02:16,904 --> 00:02:18,537
-Hey, you guys

48
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:20,839
should totally join us
for a game of bowling.

49
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,509
We're just by ourselves here
in this big lane.

50
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:25,444
-Oh, yeah, sure. That'd be fun.

51
00:02:25,446 --> 00:02:26,478
- Awesome.
- All right.

52
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,746
-Okay, yeah, cool.

53
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,081
- Are you gonna
buy us a drink if we win?

54
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:30,716
- You know,
we'll buy you a drink anyway,

55
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:32,851
because chivalry is still alive,
believe it or not.

56
00:02:32,853 --> 00:02:34,753
- Oh. All right.
- Yeah. I like that.

57
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,222
- Oh!
- Yeah!

58
00:02:37,224 --> 00:02:38,624
-Okay, okay!

59
00:02:38,626 --> 00:02:40,159
We can work with that.
We can work with that.

60
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,361
- All right, take a deep breath.

61
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:48,534
Aah!

62
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,169
Oh! - Oh!

63
00:02:57,043 --> 00:02:58,310
-Oh!

64
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:03,081
-Um, well, this is me.

65
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,750
-Nice.

66
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,151
- Thank you so much
for walking me.

67
00:03:06,153 --> 00:03:07,553
-Yeah, no problem.

68
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:09,321
I had fun... Tonight.

69
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,056
- Yeah.

70
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:13,158
- We should definitely
hang out again.

71
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,793
-Um, yeah.

72
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:16,695
I mean...

73
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,863
Ugh.

74
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:21,166
I should have told you
this earlier, but, um...

75
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:23,068
I'm seeing someone.

76
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,306
Well, we've only been
on two dates,

77
00:03:27,308 --> 00:03:29,007
but, um,
I did promise him a third.

78
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,842
- I-I think we should
go on a date.

79
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,911
What's the worst
that could happen?

80
00:03:32,913 --> 00:03:34,546
Come on.
- Just give me your phone.

81
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:36,648
-Sure. Think about it.

82
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,020
-Okay.

83
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,290
Okay.

84
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,192
Well, bye. - Bye.

85
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,260
-Mm.

86
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,729
- Good night.
- Good night.

87
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,863
-Dinner.

88
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,000
- As friends.
- Yeah.

89
00:03:55,002 --> 00:03:56,501
- Bye.

90
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,712
- You know, what's funny is
a month ago,

91
00:04:06,714 --> 00:04:08,313
this would have been
a different story.

92
00:04:08,315 --> 00:04:11,950
She promised
this guy a third date.

93
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:14,152
Ugh. I'm unlucky.

94
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,654
It's like
every girl in this town,

95
00:04:15,656 --> 00:04:17,389
they're playing a game,
you know?

96
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,324
And the hotter the chick...
pbht!

97
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:21,026
The crazier the game.

98
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,264
I'm good, man.

99
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:26,932
-This one's on her.

100
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,509
-Thanks.

101
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:41,179
I, um...

102
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:43,949
I usually don't drink alone.

103
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:46,918
-So don't.

104
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,559
-I'm harry.

105
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:56,762
- I'm maren.
- Hi, maren.

106
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,101
So... Maren.

107
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,438
-Do you stay at this hotel?

108
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,740
-Yeah. I'm here for the weekend.

109
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,575
Doing some open houses.

110
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:14,046
I live in westchester.

111
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:16,915
- Wow. That's pretty fancy.

112
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,785
- Yeah.

113
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:22,120
But I get to see my kids
when I'm in town.

114
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,122
- Your kids?

115
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,891
You don't have kids.

116
00:05:25,893 --> 00:05:27,793
You have three kids.
She has three kids.

117
00:05:27,795 --> 00:05:29,027
Wow.

118
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:30,896
- One's in college
here in the city.

119
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,931
- Were you pregnant
in middle school?

120
00:05:32,933 --> 00:05:35,467
-Oh. Cute.

121
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:38,003
I bet you say that
to all the moms.

122
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:42,074
-You divorced?

123
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:47,879
- Hey, you know what?
It's his loss.

124
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:52,617
-So, harry...

125
00:05:52,619 --> 00:05:55,220
Why are you drinking alone?

126
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,101
-What?

127
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:20,245
-Mm.

128
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:22,214
Mm.

129
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:28,887
- Okay.
I have a confession to make.

130
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,590
- Really? What?
- Yeah.

131
00:06:33,827 --> 00:06:36,561
It's been a year
since I've had sex.

132
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:40,899
-Whoa. You married?

133
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,601
-What?

134
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:45,570
No, no. No.

135
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:46,972
Um...

136
00:06:49,843 --> 00:06:52,444
My fiancÃ©e cheated on me.

137
00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,713
Awhile back.

138
00:06:57,016 --> 00:06:59,384
-Okay.

139
00:06:59,386 --> 00:07:01,987
We'll go slow.

140
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:05,891
Mm?

141
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:10,629
Want to hand me that glass?

142
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,969
I have a confession to make,
too.

143
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,108
-What's that?

144
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,010
-I'm nervous, too.

145
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:27,412
- You're nervous, too?
That's good.

146
00:07:27,414 --> 00:07:28,980
That's good. Nervous is good.

147
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:31,683
-You want to try something fun?

148
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,618
-Okay.

149
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,125
- It's like in high school.
Remember?

150
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41,626
- I did not do that
in high school.

151
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,328
- You didn't?

152
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,931
- Well, we went to different
schools, probably.

153
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,966
-Yeah.

154
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,670
-I went on a date tonight.

155
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:55,640
My first in a really,
really long time.

156
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:58,777
And, um...

157
00:07:58,779 --> 00:08:03,815
It was with this guy
I hadn't seen since college.

158
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,352
You know how things get built up
over e-mail and text?

159
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:11,089
And... and we met. It was weird.

160
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,792
-Why was it weird?

161
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:17,662
-Well, let's start with... Size.

162
00:08:21,235 --> 00:08:22,801
-Was he, like...

163
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,336
-50 pounds heavier than...

164
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,378
- oh, I was thinking something
completely different.

165
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,074
- That's when
I should have left, right?

166
00:08:30,143 --> 00:08:32,043
But I stayed,

167
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:37,749
and he started
sucking my fingers at dinner.

168
00:08:40,654 --> 00:08:42,821
Who does that?

169
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,458
Hey.

170
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,926
I want you to know

171
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:51,997
that not every guy out there
is gonna be like him.

172
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:55,400
You know, we're not all flabby,
dishonest...

173
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,669
Finger sucking
at the dinner table weirdos.

174
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:09,114
Let's not put
any pressure on tonight.

175
00:09:10,149 --> 00:09:12,817
Whatever it is is what it is.

176
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:24,696
- I'm so confused.
I set it all up for you.

177
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:26,164
I just can't believe
you didn't nail her.

178
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,966
- I walked her home.
I actually liked her.

179
00:09:27,968 --> 00:09:29,200
It's always about
nailing somebody.

180
00:09:29,202 --> 00:09:30,735
Why do you always
have to nail somebody?

181
00:09:30,737 --> 00:09:31,736
-Okay.

182
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:33,071
Then you went out han solo,

183
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,206
nailed a new chick
after getting rejected.

184
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:37,275
- It's different,
and I wasn't rejected.

185
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:39,611
We... you know,
we... we parted amicably.

186
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,446
- You at least make out?
- No.

187
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:42,781
But...

188
00:09:42,783 --> 00:09:44,249
We're supposed to go out
to dinner.

189
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,183
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

190
00:09:45,185 --> 00:09:47,919
And that relationship's dead.

191
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,755
- You think so?
Why do you think it's dead?

192
00:09:50,757 --> 00:09:52,257
- Have you ever
successfully dated a girl

193
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:54,225
where you didn't get
some small kiss

194
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:56,861
or some inkling of progression
by the night's end?

195
00:09:58,432 --> 00:09:59,531
I got her number.

196
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,232
-Meaningless without a make out.

197
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,768
But you know what?
Tell me about the second one.

198
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,170
-I don't know.

199
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:06,838
The sec... the second one
was a one-night thing.

200
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,073
It was... it was nothing.

201
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:09,374
- Was she hot?
- Yeah.

202
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:10,909
Older. - Oh?

203
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:12,310
- Yeah.
- Older. Okay.

204
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:15,246
Now you can reapproach
the first girl

205
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:16,448
with that confidence
you were lacking.

206
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,882
-I'm confused.

207
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,150
I thought you just said
the first one was dead.

208
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,685
- You can text her
something naughty.

209
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:22,120
Like, what is she, uh...

210
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,388
You know, what kind of panties
does she wear?

211
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,789
Like, oh, is she loud...

212
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:25,957
- she's seeing someone else,
okay?

213
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,225
-Scratch her off the list.

214
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:28,793
Text the milf something dirty.

215
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:29,961
She's totally your strong hand.

216
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,596
-I'm not texting anybody.

217
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:33,331
- You have a golden opportunity

218
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,734
to have a little fun with
zero chance of getting hurt.

219
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:39,371
- Shh. Shh, shh. Hello?
- Zero chance.

220
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:41,306
-Oh, hey.

221
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,910
All right, yeah. Bye.

222
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,115
- Who was that?
- It was the second one.

223
00:10:50,117 --> 00:10:53,551
She wanted to hang out later,
so we might, you know...

224
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:54,719
jared, stop that.

225
00:10:54,721 --> 00:10:56,054
Don't look at me like that.

226
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,589
I'm just maybe
grabbing a coffee with her.

227
00:10:57,591 --> 00:10:59,457
Look at me. That's it.

228
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:05,764
God.

229
00:11:05,766 --> 00:11:06,831
-Oh, god.

230
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:15,473
Your secret's gonna come out.

231
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:21,012
-What secret?

232
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:24,349
- When all the other girls
find out how good you are,

233
00:11:24,351 --> 00:11:27,719
I'm gonna have to beat them
off you with a stick.

234
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,793
I'm just messing with you.

235
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:43,902
I wouldn't want this to be
anything more than what it is.

236
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,638
Hmm?

237
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:51,543
-Yeah.

238
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:02,887
Tell me about the girl
from yesterday.

239
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,256
-What girl from yesterday?

240
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,391
-You know.

241
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,493
- What girl from yesterday?

242
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:12,964
The one that got you all
bent out of shape at the bar.

243
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15,700
Is she cute?

244
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,369
Come on.

245
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:20,672
She...

246
00:12:20,674 --> 00:12:22,073
yeah.

247
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,143
I thought we had a connection,

248
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:29,714
and then she told me
that she was seeing another guy,

249
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,350
and she had, uh, she had
promised this guy a third date,

250
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:33,351
so...

251
00:12:33,353 --> 00:12:37,255
Anyway, that was it, you know?

252
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,424
It's over.

253
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:41,493
-What?

254
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,094
No, it's not over!

255
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,698
- It is very much over.
- No!

256
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,767
Text her.

257
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,504
-Right now?

258
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:53,905
-Yeah.

259
00:12:53,907 --> 00:12:55,707
-She just wants to be friends.

260
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:58,643
-She's playing hard to get.

261
00:12:58,645 --> 00:13:00,245
-You're unbelievable.

262
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:01,679
I can't believe
you're encouraging this.

263
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:02,747
-You know what? I'll text her.

264
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:04,149
-No. You will not.

265
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:06,851
You will not text anyone,
young lady.

266
00:13:06,853 --> 00:13:08,653
<i>I</i> will text her.

267
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:10,054
When I get home.

268
00:13:10,056 --> 00:13:11,122
-Text her now.

269
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:12,590
If she answers right back,

270
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:14,626
it's because she likes you.

271
00:13:19,165 --> 00:13:21,032
- I'll see if she wants
to grab dinner tonight.

272
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,534
- It's too last minute.

273
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,203
It's as if you weren't
really thinking about her.

274
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,838
Ask her to something
more casual,

275
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,841
like coffee or lunch.

276
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,343
- How about
I invite her to brunch?

277
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,082
-"Hey.

278
00:13:38,084 --> 00:13:44,255
You... Want to grab... Brunch
sometime?"

279
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,825
- "Brunch tomorrow"
question mark.

280
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,326
Light.

281
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:57,168
- "Brunch tomorrow"
question mark.

282
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,371
-Send.

283
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,208
- You know what I love
about new york city?

284
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,310
- Um, the rats?
- Nope.

285
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,277
- Pollution?
- Nope.

286
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,545
- Construction?
- Yes!

287
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:09,314
Construction. I was...

288
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,481
they're always building stuff.

289
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,716
Like, what are they building?

290
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:12,951
-I don't know. It's new york.

291
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:14,185
- You don't do construction,
do you?

292
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,654
- No, I work in I.T. Sales.

293
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:18,089
- Really? I.T.
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:19,257
I thought you were gonna say
something sexier,

295
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,459
like... Actuarial science.

296
00:14:22,596 --> 00:14:24,562
Well, what do you do?

297
00:14:24,564 --> 00:14:27,131
-Uh, I don't do anything.

298
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:29,767
-Tell me more.

299
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,469
- I don't do nothing.
I'm... I'm in school.

300
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,839
I'm finishing up a two-year
grad program at columbia.

301
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:36,074
Studying architecture.

302
00:14:36,076 --> 00:14:37,775
- Oh, no way.
My dad's an architect.

303
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:39,177
-Get out of here.

304
00:14:39,179 --> 00:14:41,012
- Yeah, he's a partner
at kenner and boyd.

305
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:43,147
-K&b? Wow.

306
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:45,450
I'm supposed to interview
with them next week.

307
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:48,553
- Oh, well, I'll make sure
he keeps an eye out for you.

308
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,855
So, um...

309
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:53,658
I need... I need
your male advice for something.

310
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,261
-Okay. Shoot.

311
00:14:56,263 --> 00:15:01,432
- I went on the third date
with that guy last night.

312
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:04,369
And I don't know.
We just had an okay time.

313
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:07,639
- Was it... was it good okay?
Was it... was it bad okay?

314
00:15:07,641 --> 00:15:10,441
- First of all, he doesn't make
any plan for dinner.

315
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:11,276
Okay?

316
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:12,577
And then he says,

317
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,646
"oh, we'll just go
wherever you want to go."

318
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:17,282
So we end up just, like,
spending an hour

319
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,950
walking
the streets of no reservation

320
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:20,618
looking for a table. - No.

321
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,053
You don't have your date
walk the streets in heels

322
00:15:22,055 --> 00:15:23,621
when you can just use an app.

323
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:26,024
- You mean the app for his...
Flip phone?

324
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,159
-Are you serious? Ugh. Grace,

325
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:30,561
grace. No.

326
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:32,530
He has a flip phone? - Yeah.

327
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,165
- What kind of batteries
does that thing take?

328
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,934
Is it like aa or aaa?

329
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,569
- Oh, I know.

330
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:40,071
Oh. It's him.

331
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,539
It's, uh, it's flip phone.

332
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:46,010
He's apologizing
for the restaurant debacle.

333
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:48,079
Hmm.

334
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:49,914
- You're...
you're gonna see him again?

335
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:54,118
- He says he wants to meet today
for coffee.

336
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,788
Why so soon after our last date?

337
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,890
What does that mean?

338
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:00,124
-I don't know.

339
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,125
I mean, coffee today

340
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:02,560
just seems really last minute,

341
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,729
it's like he's not even
thinking about you.

342
00:16:05,764 --> 00:16:08,399
-You think?

343
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:14,906
- Or he really likes you
and he wants to see you again.

344
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,643
-You're the best. Thanks.

345
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,579
-No problem.

346
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:27,218
Well, um, I feel foolish.

347
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:30,488
I mean, there's a part of me
that feels naive.

348
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:34,092
I wonder why I ever got
my hopes up to begin with.

349
00:16:34,094 --> 00:16:36,361
Look, I-I-it's not working out.

350
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:39,964
I have to accept that.

351
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:42,767
I have to accept that

352
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:45,136
she just...
she likes some other clown.

353
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,171
-Take off your pants.

354
00:16:47,173 --> 00:16:49,140
- You know she's with him
right now.

355
00:16:49,142 --> 00:16:50,842
They're out having coffee.

356
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:53,277
Coffee? Yeah, right.

357
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,213
-Girls play games, sweetheart.

358
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,614
-You never played any games.

359
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:58,716
-Mm. I don't have to play games.

360
00:17:03,455 --> 00:17:05,490
- It's her.
- Mm-hmm.

361
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:10,461
-He broke up with her.

362
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,264
-Mm. Sad.

363
00:17:15,769 --> 00:17:18,703
- "I can really use
someone to talk to right now.

364
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,005
Are you free?"

365
00:17:21,007 --> 00:17:22,440
She wants to see me.

366
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,309
- Great.

367
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:31,582
No, no. She wants to see me.

368
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,750
I mean,
you of all people should know

369
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:35,386
this is
a pretty critical moment.

370
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,889
- I understand.

371
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:42,026
But I'd really like to have sex
before I leave.

372
00:17:42,028 --> 00:17:44,462
Hmm?

373
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:50,501
- I-I don't... I don't think
this is a good idea.

374
00:17:52,505 --> 00:17:54,772
-Why not?

375
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,809
-Um...

376
00:17:57,811 --> 00:18:01,112
'Cause I might be starting
something with this girl.

377
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:02,547
- Wait.

378
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,249
One minute ago,
it was okay to have sex,

379
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,852
and now it's not?

380
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,153
-I mean, technically,

381
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,922
I didn't have a shot
with this girl a minute ago,

382
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:13,024
so now I'm just like,
"I can't sleep with you

383
00:18:13,026 --> 00:18:14,859
and then run off to see her."

384
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,762
-It's not like you're cheating.

385
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,997
-No, I know. It...

386
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:21,432
it's just dishonest.

387
00:18:22,734 --> 00:18:25,736
I-I don't want
to start a new relationship off

388
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,904
on the wrong foot.

389
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,141
-This is new.

390
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:31,809
-Yeah, this is new.

391
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:37,381
But we both agree that this was
gonna be a fun weekend thing.

392
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,616
- Why would you
even come back here

393
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:41,752
if you think so little of me?

394
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:47,658
You get one text from that girl
and I'm out?

395
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,528
- You were the one that
encouraged me to ask her out.

396
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,436
What did she say?

397
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,914
Don't come back.

398
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,019
-Are you serious?

399
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:17,455
Maren, this is stupid.

400
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,023
Let's just talk about this
like adults.

401
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,525
-You are selfish.

402
00:19:22,629 --> 00:19:24,795
You don't care who you hurt.

403
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,299
Please leave.

404
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,567
Go.

405
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:31,836
-Fine.

406
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:33,604
I'm sorry.

407
00:19:34,706 --> 00:19:37,141
No, you know what? - No.

408
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,177
Don't talk.

409
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:41,579
Whatever.

410
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,015
I've done nothing wrong.

411
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,476
-Hey.

412
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:19,777
Thank you for taking me up
to meet your dad.

413
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,012
I really appreciate it.

414
00:21:21,014 --> 00:21:22,847
-Yeah, of course.

415
00:21:22,849 --> 00:21:24,215
You know, I think it's good

416
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,816
that you didn't meet him
during your interview,

417
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:28,185
'cause this is way more relaxed.

418
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,620
-Do I look nervous?

419
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,156
No?

420
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:34,892
-Don't be nervous.

421
00:21:34,894 --> 00:21:38,162
He's super cool,
and he makes a mean barbecue.

422
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,264
-I am starving.

423
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,632
-Me, too.

424
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:51,008
I can't walk into my parents'
house looking all flushed.

425
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:56,814
Okay, just make a left
into this driveway.

426
00:22:15,801 --> 00:22:18,169
-Well... Here goes nothing.

427
00:22:18,171 --> 00:22:20,004
- Don't worry.

428
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:22,840
-There they are!

429
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,774
Oh!

430
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,343
Hi, sweetheart. How are you?

431
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,844
Hello. You must be harry.

432
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,746
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- No, call me phil.

433
00:22:28,748 --> 00:22:30,514
Call me phil. Come on in.

434
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:31,916
-Where's mom?

435
00:22:31,918 --> 00:22:34,218
- Uh, she's out finishing up
some gardening.

436
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,053
So the drive up was okay?

437
00:22:36,055 --> 00:22:38,689
- Yeah.
We just took 95 all the way.

438
00:22:38,691 --> 00:22:40,624
And we brought wine.

439
00:22:40,626 --> 00:22:42,426
-Red. That is perfect.

440
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:43,494
Let's have some.

441
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:45,029
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

442
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:47,665
- The interviewer said
good things about you, harry.

443
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:50,067
- Thank you.
That's always good to hear.

444
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:52,336
- What other firms
are you meeting with?

445
00:22:52,338 --> 00:22:53,571
-A handful of others.

446
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,240
Miller and samuels, design inc.,

447
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:58,042
the marcus company, the foundry.

448
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,477
-Oh. Chicago.

449
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,245
-You'd leave new york?

450
00:23:01,247 --> 00:23:03,381
-I don't really want to, but...

451
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:05,082
-Any offers?

452
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:07,852
- Not yet, but hopefully,
someone will make one soon.

453
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:09,920
- Hopefully.

454
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:12,289
- You got your degree
at columbia, right?

455
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:14,358
- For grad school, yes.
- And undergrad?

456
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,127
- Dartmouth.
- Oh.

457
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,209
"Animal house" is one of
my all-time favorite movies.

458
00:23:20,266 --> 00:23:22,066
Phil, I got to tell you,
uh, this house is amazing.

459
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,134
Did you build this?

460
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,002
- I just did
some major renovations.

461
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,271
The original contractor
was a crook.

462
00:23:27,273 --> 00:23:30,808
He used the wrong materials.
He cut a lot of corners.

463
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,343
Part of the foundation
was sinking

464
00:23:32,345 --> 00:23:34,278
four years after it was done.

465
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,646
-That's not good.

466
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,348
- No, I was so busy
with work at the firm,

467
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,518
I didn't even know what
was happening in my own home.

468
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,353
- That's crazy.

469
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,656
- Hi!
- Hi!

470
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:47,658
-Hi, sweetie! You're early.

471
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,759
I am? I thought I said 5:00.

472
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,161
- Really?
- I don't know.

473
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,531
-Want some wine, hon?

474
00:23:57,803 --> 00:23:59,737
-Mom, are you okay?

475
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,505
- Yeah. No.

476
00:24:01,507 --> 00:24:02,973
No, I'm not okay.

477
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:06,610
I thi... I think I'm overheating.

478
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:07,878
- Well, you were out there
for a long time.

479
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,113
That sun's a real killer.

480
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,215
- I'm so hot.
- I'll get you some water.

481
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,117
- Thank you.

482
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:13,951
-You okay?

483
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:16,620
-Yeah, I'm fine. Stop fussing.

484
00:24:16,622 --> 00:24:18,255
-We're out of, um, bottles.

485
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:20,791
-In the pantry.

486
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,960
Well, maybe you should go
lie down, huh?

487
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:25,229
-No. Just go start the grill.

488
00:24:25,231 --> 00:24:27,465
-All right. Okay.

489
00:24:32,437 --> 00:24:33,737
The fuck are you doing here?!

490
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,706
-You said you were divorced!

491
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,774
- What are you doing
with my daughter?

492
00:24:36,776 --> 00:24:38,375
-Oh, your daughter?

493
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:40,377
You mean "the one I was all bent
out of shape about at the bar"?

494
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:42,046
-Oh, god.

495
00:24:42,048 --> 00:24:43,414
- I found it.
- Hey!

496
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:45,683
-Oh, mom. You look worse.

497
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:47,251
-I'm just dehydrated.

498
00:24:47,253 --> 00:24:50,454
- Um, hey, I'm gonna go help
your dad with the grill.

499
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,089
-No. No.

500
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:55,025
I want you right here.

501
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:57,728
I have so much to ask you about.

502
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,849
-So, how'd you two meet?

503
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:21,852
- Um, we were actually both
out bowling one night.

504
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:23,320
- Oh.

505
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:26,357
You know, as someone
from an older generation,

506
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:29,727
I'm fascinated
by how dating works these days.

507
00:25:29,729 --> 00:25:31,262
-What do you mean?

508
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:32,863
- Well, back in the days
of your grandparents,

509
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,665
or even back when we met,

510
00:25:34,667 --> 00:25:37,167
things just moved a lot slower.

511
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:42,273
There was no internet,
no social media, no texting.

512
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:45,009
- I remember being so nervous
when I picked up the phone

513
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:47,011
to ask your mother out
on our first date,

514
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:49,113
that I must have hung up
10 times

515
00:25:49,115 --> 00:25:51,415
before I actually dialed
at last.

516
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:54,685
Texting has got to be a lot
easier than that.

517
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:58,155
And, you know, e-mailing...
let me tell you.

518
00:25:58,157 --> 00:26:01,058
That has made coursework
so much easier.

519
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:04,295
- Harry,
did you text or call first?

520
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:06,630
- You texted, remember?
- I texted?

521
00:26:06,632 --> 00:26:07,765
I texted.

522
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,466
Yes. My mind's a sieve.

523
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,369
Must have been some other floozy
you were calling.

524
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:14,772
- Oh, no.

525
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:17,341
- I believe
that the best relationships

526
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,776
start as friendships.

527
00:26:18,778 --> 00:26:20,911
- Yeah, dad.
I've heard this one before.

528
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,446
-Well, I'll say it again.

529
00:26:22,448 --> 00:26:25,616
It's what makes the relationship
I have with your mother

530
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,850
that much stronger.

531
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:28,852
- So you two
are more like friends?

532
00:26:30,956 --> 00:26:32,723
-Of course we're friends.

533
00:26:32,725 --> 00:26:35,526
-So, it's platonic?

534
00:26:35,528 --> 00:26:38,862
-Well, like phil so wisely said,

535
00:26:38,864 --> 00:26:42,433
um, you know,
the best relationships

536
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:45,235
are... Founded on friendship.

537
00:26:45,237 --> 00:26:46,804
-Oh.

538
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:50,441
So you two are just friends?
- We're dating.

539
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,710
- Wait, I'm... I'm confused.
Which... which is it?

540
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:56,347
- Maren, I don't think we need
to label every little detail.

541
00:26:56,349 --> 00:26:59,316
- No, I don't see this
as every little detail.

542
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:01,785
I'd like to know what kind of
relationship our daughter is in.

543
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:04,788
- Mom, please.
We're dating. The end.

544
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:06,123
-Yeah, you say that,

545
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,125
but it seems as if harry
is saying one thing

546
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,027
and you're saying another thing.

547
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,896
Back when your dad and I
were going out,

548
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,898
it wasn't until
we were physically intimate

549
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,100
that we both agreed
that we were dating.

550
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,534
-Mom!

551
00:27:17,536 --> 00:27:19,803
If you want to know if harry
and I have had sex, just ask.

552
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:20,971
-We haven't had sex.

553
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,640
- Harry!
- I'm sorry.

554
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,041
Can we please change
the subject?

555
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:25,776
- Yes. Please.
Let's just change the subject.

556
00:27:25,778 --> 00:27:27,311
- I'd like some more wine,
please.

557
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:28,979
-In a bit, maren.

558
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:30,381
-I'd like some more wine now.

559
00:27:30,383 --> 00:27:33,617
- I think you've had enough
for now.

560
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,086
-Jesus christ!

561
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:42,292
Excuse me.

562
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:47,164
Did somebody say something
to piss you off?

563
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,867
- Have you seen the mustard?

564
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,802
- I don't know.
Maybe it's on the table.

565
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,971
You are being so rude to harry.

566
00:27:53,973 --> 00:27:56,340
Uh, we're considering him
for a position,

567
00:27:56,342 --> 00:27:58,342
and grace seems
to really like him.

568
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,678
-I don't like him.

569
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,779
He's a phony.

570
00:28:01,781 --> 00:28:03,313
-Maren, if this is about me

571
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:05,049
and whatever problem
you have with me,

572
00:28:05,051 --> 00:28:06,884
you don't need to take it out
on our daughter's friend.

573
00:28:06,886 --> 00:28:09,353
- Oh. I'm guilty
for your indiscretions?

574
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,954
- My...

575
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,023
my past whatever
you want to call them

576
00:28:13,025 --> 00:28:14,458
and you being rude to harry

577
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,660
have absolutely nothing
to do with each other.

578
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,495
Nothing.

579
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,697
-Oh, really?

580
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,099
-Yes. Yes. Really.

581
00:28:27,772 --> 00:28:29,306
-What?

582
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,376
-What?

583
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,378
-Nothing.

584
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,246
- You know what?
You've been drinking.

585
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:37,915
And I don't want to argue with
you when you're in this state,

586
00:28:37,917 --> 00:28:38,982
especially when we have company.

587
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,118
- I love it.

588
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,520
I say what's on my mind,

589
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,389
and you say
it's because I've been drinking,

590
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:48,125
because we can't have
a conversation.

591
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:49,793
- Well, sweetheart,
you are drinking,

592
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:50,828
and we're having a conversation.

593
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,196
-I'm gonna ask you to have

594
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,398
this exact same conversation
tomorrow morning,

595
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,334
and I will be
stone-fucking-cold sober.

596
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:59,169
And guess what?
- I'm sure you will be.

597
00:28:59,171 --> 00:29:01,205
- I will say
the exact same things

598
00:29:01,207 --> 00:29:02,773
and they will have had
nothing...

599
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:05,976
- my mom is driving me nuts.

600
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:08,312
She's acting really weird.

601
00:29:08,314 --> 00:29:11,415
- I-I just... I don't know
what she acts like normally,

602
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,851
so I don't have a scale.

603
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,598
-What's wrong?

604
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:31,235
-Maybe it's best if I leave

605
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,771
and give your parents
some space.

606
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,206
-You think?

607
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,207
-Yeah.

608
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,509
Um...

609
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,885
Yeah. You know what?

610
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:51,155
I'm not feeling very well.

611
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,056
- Oh?
- Uh...

612
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:55,459
I think I need to get some air.

613
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,294
- We're outside.
- I think it's the food.

614
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,229
It's the food.
- Oh, no. It's the food?

615
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:01,165
- It's not the food.
It's my... it's me.

616
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:03,066
It's my ibs.
I think my ibs is acting up.

617
00:30:03,068 --> 00:30:04,968
- Irritable bowel syndrome?
- Mm-hmm.

618
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,336
-You were just talking about

619
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,871
your cast-iron stomach
the other day.

620
00:30:07,873 --> 00:30:09,106
-I know. It's weird.

621
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:10,307
Aside from a mild
lactose intolerance,

622
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:13,277
I'm usually ironclad, but, uh...
Oh, man.

623
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,545
You know,
I'm gonna go to the pharmacy.

624
00:30:14,547 --> 00:30:15,746
- No, no, no.
It's around the corner.

625
00:30:15,748 --> 00:30:17,748
I'll go. It's fine.

626
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,049
Harry needs lactose pills.

627
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:20,117
-Yeah. Ugh.

628
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,585
- You do?
- Mm-hmm.

629
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:25,022
Uh, my stomach's not in the best
of moods right now.

630
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,991
So I told... I was gonna go
to the pharmacy.

631
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:29,593
-I'll drive you.

632
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:30,594
-Grace just offered.

633
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,229
- It'll give us
some time to chat.

634
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,564
- Honestly, I don't want
to inconvenience you.

635
00:30:33,566 --> 00:30:34,832
-I insist.

636
00:30:34,834 --> 00:30:36,600
-I think it's a good idea.

637
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:39,336
- Grace and I can catch up
on a few things.

638
00:30:43,576 --> 00:30:47,010
Um... You know, I'm thinking
it might be just best

639
00:30:47,012 --> 00:30:48,612
if I head out a little early,

640
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:50,547
'cause I'm gonna be spending the
night at my buddy jared's place,

641
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53,250
so if I get...
- Just get in the car.

642
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,062
- I'm... I'm sorry
I'm not feeling well.

643
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:06,930
-You can tell me the truth.

644
00:31:06,932 --> 00:31:08,732
I can handle it.

645
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:12,903
-Your food is really good.

646
00:31:12,905 --> 00:31:14,438
It's delicious.

647
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,906
And my stomach pains
are in no way

648
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,274
meant to impugn your cooking.

649
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:19,676
- It's not about my cooking.
It's about maren.

650
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,018
I know you're uncomfortable.

651
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,519
But think about how I feel.

652
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:34,858
- I have to live with this
every day.

653
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,565
I'm sorry.

654
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,368
I'm so sorry, phil.

655
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,771
When I agreed
to meet grace's parents

656
00:31:47,773 --> 00:31:51,141
nothing could have prepared me
to see maren face-to-face.

657
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,579
I want to apologize
for my behavior.

658
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,447
I feel awful.

659
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,586
- You want to apologize?
- Yes.

660
00:32:03,788 --> 00:32:05,589
-You feel awful?

661
00:32:07,025 --> 00:32:09,293
-I do.

662
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,696
- What'd<i> you</i> do?
You were invited to dinner.

663
00:32:12,698 --> 00:32:16,466
You had no idea you were gonna
walk into all that tension.

664
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:18,735
Maren and I,

665
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,537
we've been having struggles
for awhile now,

666
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:24,241
and it's... I feel really badly

667
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:27,110
that you got dragged
into the middle of it.

668
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:31,248
I'm embarrassed.

669
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,517
And I know you're uncomfortable.

670
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,851
-Little bit.

671
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,521
-I-I-I want to apologize.

672
00:32:37,523 --> 00:32:39,790
I'm sorry.

673
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,694
-Hey.

674
00:32:43,696 --> 00:32:46,363
Apology accepted.

675
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,899
-Good.

676
00:32:48,901 --> 00:32:50,534
Thanks.

677
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,570
Well,
I'm glad we cleared the air.

678
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:57,407
I feel better.

679
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,446
-Oof.

680
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:04,281
I'm not washing anything by hand
tonight.

681
00:33:04,283 --> 00:33:06,016
- No, just put everything
in here.

682
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:09,553
Get rid of it.
- Yeah. Put it in.

683
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:14,825
Honey...

684
00:33:15,526 --> 00:33:17,160
You really like this guy, huh?

685
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,662
-Yeah, I think I do.

686
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,163
-Mm.

687
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,167
But he is a little old for you,
isn't he?

688
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,702
- Mom.

689
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,737
We're just dating, okay?

690
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:28,105
We're not getting married
or anything.

691
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:29,506
We're just...

692
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,807
you know, we're getting
to know each other.

693
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:31,842
We're figuring it out.

694
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,276
-Yeah.

695
00:33:33,278 --> 00:33:35,245
I just don't want you
rushing into situations

696
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:37,114
before you're emotionally ready.

697
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:39,416
-Oh.

698
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:41,218
You mean like
how you and dad had me

699
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,652
before you were prepared?

700
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,658
-Okay.

701
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,560
We did initially
rush into things,

702
00:33:50,562 --> 00:33:54,464
but that was then,
and look at us now.

703
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:58,935
-I need to ask you something.

704
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:01,872
- Okay.

705
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:04,141
-Is dad having an affair?

706
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:06,610
-No.

707
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:08,512
No. Of course not.

708
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:10,347
-I don't... I don't know.

709
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:12,682
What is it?
Are<i> you</i> having an affair?

710
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,584
-Honey!

711
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:17,387
Sweetheart, please.

712
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,557
- It just... it just feels
really weird in this house.

713
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:23,160
I don't know. Am I imagining it?

714
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:25,462
- There's nothing going on,
sweetie.

715
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,098
-Here.

716
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,266
Room for this?

717
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:31,802
- Yeah.

718
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:46,283
Uh, I'll meet you
at the register.

719
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:48,351
-Okay.

720
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,856
-Hi, sweetheart.

721
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:53,890
Hi.

722
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,258
Those are your eyes, baby.

723
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,427
- That nose... the nose
is definitely yours.

724
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,362
- Okay, maybe it's my nose,
but those are your eyes.

725
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:00,564
-You think so?

726
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,698
- Yeah,
that's what you look like.

727
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,266
- Yo.

728
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:06,803
- I am in some serious shit
right now, man.

729
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:08,672
The mom that I slept with
a month ago?

730
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:10,140
-Uh-huh.

731
00:35:10,142 --> 00:35:11,441
-Grace's mother!

732
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:13,076
- No fudging way.
- What?

733
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,578
-Yeah, fudging way.

734
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,546
Now I'm stuck in a house
with her and grace.

735
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:19,616
- That is incredible.

736
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,651
- I d... I'm freaking out, man.
I got to bail.

737
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:24,421
- No, no, no, no, no. Bad move.
- Wait. What?

738
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:26,356
- The most important thing
in this situation right now,

739
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:28,258
you are one step away

740
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,927
from having a mother/daughter
threesome.

741
00:35:30,929 --> 00:35:33,697
Oh, my god. He's about to have
a mother-daughter threesome.

742
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:34,764
-Ew! Ew!

743
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,333
- I never did this
when I was single. Jesus!

744
00:35:36,335 --> 00:35:38,268
- I'm not having a
mother/daughter threesome!

745
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,941
Dude, I need you to be serious
right now.

746
00:35:44,943 --> 00:35:47,043
The husband has no idea
I had sex with his wife.

747
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,412
- There's a husband?
- Yes!

748
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:50,847
-Don't worry about it.

749
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:52,015
She is not gonna want

750
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,117
to reveal the affair
any more than you do.

751
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,652
You'll be completely fine.

752
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,722
- Are you kidding?
I think she wants a divorce.

753
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:00,056
-Play it cool.

754
00:36:00,058 --> 00:36:02,359
No open affection toward her
in front of the mother.

755
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,793
-I'm just coming over to you.

756
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,629
- Don't feed her
at the dinner table. Do not...

757
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:07,898
- you all set?
- Yeah.

758
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:13,036
-We have leftovers, sweetie.

759
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:14,604
-No, thanks.

760
00:36:14,606 --> 00:36:17,474
I saw a documentary at school
on the food industry.

761
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,843
I am done with meat.

762
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:23,380
- Well,
60 minutes of sugar is toxic.

763
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:24,814
- Better than mad cow.

764
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:26,850
-We're back!

765
00:36:34,892 --> 00:36:36,426
-How did it go?

766
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,061
-I made it.

767
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:39,362
Yay!

768
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,498
- How's things here?
- Good.

769
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,366
-Harry, this is my sister, liz.

770
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,969
-Hey. Hey, liz.

771
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:47,904
So, uh... You know,

772
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:50,106
I-I-I think I'm actually
gonna head out.

773
00:36:50,108 --> 00:36:51,641
-No! Already?

774
00:36:51,643 --> 00:36:52,876
-Well, jared's expecting me,

775
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,544
and I don't
want to keep him waiting.

776
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:56,112
- Oh, well, you know,
you really don't look 100%.

777
00:36:56,114 --> 00:36:57,547
I think that maybe you should,
like, lie down or rest.

778
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,982
- Really?
Well, that's... I feel great.

779
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,317
-Harry, do you play golf?

780
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,618
- Who doesn't?

781
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:04,087
- That's good.

782
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,355
I have an 8:47 tee time

783
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,556
with a managing partner
at the firm.

784
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:09,192
You should join us.

785
00:37:09,194 --> 00:37:11,361
- Really?
- Yeah.

786
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,830
- That sounds amazing. Yeah.
- Good.

787
00:37:13,832 --> 00:37:15,599
- Well, you should
just spend the night, then.

788
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,866
Yeah,
you can sleep in kate's bedroom.

789
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:18,602
She's still at nyu, so...
- It's empty.

790
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,604
-I-I<i> could</i> sleep in kate's room.

791
00:37:20,606 --> 00:37:23,873
Yeah, you know,
or, you know what I'll do?

792
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:27,577
- No, no. The golf course
is literally around the corner.

793
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,578
- It's not a big issue.
- Just stay the night.

794
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,013
- Listen.
- Grace.

795
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,349
I think harry is saying
he has plans.

796
00:37:32,351 --> 00:37:34,050
- It's absolutely
no inconvenience

797
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:35,819
if you want to stay
in kate's room.

798
00:37:35,821 --> 00:37:37,787
- Ugh, phil, look at me.
I'm not in the proper attire.

799
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:39,823
- Well,
we're about the same size.

800
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:42,425
Figure something out for you.

801
00:37:43,694 --> 00:37:46,162
-Um...

802
00:37:46,164 --> 00:37:48,565
Well, I guess.

803
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:49,599
-It's a done deal.

804
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,834
You're golfing in the morning,

805
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,102
and you're staying
in kate's room.

806
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:53,136
- Yay!
- Good.

807
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:54,704
-Yay. Staying in kate's room.

808
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:57,907
- I'll let the partner know.
- All right.

809
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,876
I'll get my bag.

810
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:20,430
-What the fuck are you doing?!

811
00:38:20,432 --> 00:38:22,198
-What? He made me stay!

812
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,700
-I could have burned your ass

813
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,502
when you took your fake sick
to... to the pharmacy.

814
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:27,837
And you chose to stay?!
- Give me a break.

815
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,319
Burn my ass,
and your ass gets burned.

816
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,742
I've decided to tell my husband.

817
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,345
- Okay.

818
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:41,584
Are you out of your mind?!
- Mm-hmm.

819
00:38:41,586 --> 00:38:42,919
You shouldn't have
a problem with that,

820
00:38:42,921 --> 00:38:44,654
since, according to you,
relationships need

821
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:46,122
to be founded
on a bedrock of honesty.

822
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,724
- Do not throw my words
into my face!

823
00:38:47,726 --> 00:38:49,192
You know there are exceptions
to that rule.

824
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:51,194
I am not prepared to tell grace.

825
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,629
I owe it to her
to tell her what happened.

826
00:38:52,631 --> 00:38:53,997
-Oh, bullshit!

827
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,332
You're the one that lied
about being divorced.

828
00:38:55,334 --> 00:38:56,466
-I never said I was divorced.

829
00:38:56,468 --> 00:38:59,202
- Yes, you did.
- No! You assumed.

830
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:02,472
-I think you're just jealous.

831
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:03,840
You're jealous of me and grace.

832
00:39:03,842 --> 00:39:05,041
- Oh, please.
- Admit it.

833
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,643
- What we had
was purely physical.

834
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:09,512
It was only about sex.

835
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,054
-What are you going to do?

836
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,212
- Why'd you make harry stay
when you know I'm not a fan?

837
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,550
- W-w-what do you have
against him?

838
00:39:48,652 --> 00:39:50,186
- I shouldn't have to justify
my feelings

839
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:52,355
about who gets to stay
in this house.

840
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,890
It's my house, too.

841
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,093
-You're right.

842
00:39:57,095 --> 00:39:58,795
I'm sorry.

843
00:40:03,668 --> 00:40:06,603
I don't want to fight tonight.

844
00:40:09,908 --> 00:40:12,208
I haven't had a drink
in two hours.

845
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:13,410
I'd really like to talk.

846
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:17,947
- I really want to be fresh for
my golf game tomorrow morning.

847
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:19,282
Can we just talk about this
tomorrow?

848
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:21,785
-No. No.

849
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:28,291
I want to talk now.

850
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:34,364
Fine.

851
00:40:34,366 --> 00:40:36,933
What do you want to talk about?

852
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:41,805
-I want to talk about harry.

853
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:46,309
- I just thought
that it would be easier

854
00:40:46,311 --> 00:40:49,579
if we all left together
in the morning.

855
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:52,282
What is the big deal?

856
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:02,625
You knew how I felt.

857
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,061
And you didn't care.

858
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:09,532
- Well,
what do you want me to do?

859
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,534
Should I have him
go sleep in his car?

860
00:41:12,938 --> 00:41:15,371
He was leaving
to stay at a friend's house,

861
00:41:15,373 --> 00:41:18,107
but you insisted he stay
just to contradict me.

862
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,276
-No, I didn't.

863
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:23,213
I just want him to meet
my partner on the golf course.

864
00:41:23,215 --> 00:41:25,482
- He was gonna meet you in
the morning at the golf course!

865
00:41:25,484 --> 00:41:26,950
-I already told you. I'm sorry.

866
00:41:26,952 --> 00:41:28,017
- Yes,
because you'll say anything

867
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:29,385
not to have this conversation.

868
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,754
- Then why don't you
just tell our daughter

869
00:41:31,756 --> 00:41:33,423
who she can and cannot date?

870
00:41:33,425 --> 00:41:36,059
That way we can all disregard
each other's feelings.

871
00:41:37,095 --> 00:41:39,762
That's rich, coming from you.

872
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,499
You're an asshole.

873
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:45,535
Besides,
grace is too young for him.

874
00:41:45,537 --> 00:41:48,838
He's got bags under his eyes
and a thin upper lip.

875
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,948
-Maren?

876
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,516
-No.

877
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:35,318
-Grace.

878
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,053
-You thought I was my mom?

879
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,388
-No, no.

880
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:39,956
Uh, hey. Is everything okay?

881
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:46,129
- I don't know.
Is everything okay?

882
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,097
-Holy shit.

883
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,300
- I've always wanted to have sex
in the house I grew up in.

884
00:42:50,302 --> 00:42:52,502
- I know, but I don't want to
wake your mom and dad up.

885
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:53,770
-You've been very patient.

886
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:55,204
- I know,
but your parents are right here.

887
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:57,540
- So what? It's not like
we're in high school.

888
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,475
-Yeah.

889
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,177
Okay.

890
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:06,215
Grace, I really don't feel
comfortable pressuring you.

891
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,986
-Is it my outfit?

892
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:11,821
Is it too much? - No. No, hey.

893
00:43:11,823 --> 00:43:15,692
You look amazing.
Like, amazing amazing.

894
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:17,060
It's just I'm... I'm here,

895
00:43:17,062 --> 00:43:18,328
and it's...
it's a strange house.

896
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,862
It's... like,
the house isn't that st...

897
00:43:19,864 --> 00:43:20,964
what the fuck was that?

898
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:22,999
- What? What?
- Listen. Shh.

899
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:25,602
I heard something.

900
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:26,703
-You need to relax.

901
00:43:26,705 --> 00:43:28,137
-Oh, my god. Okay.

902
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:29,606
You know what I'm gonna do?
Hey. Hey, babe.

903
00:43:29,608 --> 00:43:31,107
You know what I'm gonna do?
- Mm?

904
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,276
- I'm just gonna go...
I'm gonna go and brush my teeth.

905
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:36,980
And then I'm... I'm gonna
come back here after...

906
00:43:36,982 --> 00:43:38,114
after I brush them,

907
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:39,649
so you don't go anywhere, okay?

908
00:43:39,651 --> 00:43:41,918
- Okay.
- All right.

909
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:43,753
Be right back. - Okay.

910
00:43:50,462 --> 00:43:52,061
You're gonna go back in there.

911
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,429
You're gonna tell her
you're tired.

912
00:43:53,431 --> 00:43:55,398
You're gonna tell her
you're very, very tired.

913
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,966
You need to get
a good night's sleep

914
00:43:56,968 --> 00:43:58,601
so you can impress her dad
and his partner

915
00:43:58,603 --> 00:43:59,902
at the golf course tomorrow,

916
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:01,070
and you're gonna be out
of this house,

917
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:02,071
you're gonna be home free.

918
00:44:02,073 --> 00:44:03,373
It's all you got to do.

919
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:11,714
-No, no, no, no.

920
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:13,116
Hey! Psst! Psst! Psst!

921
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:15,885
Come... come here. In here.

922
00:44:15,887 --> 00:44:20,456
I hav... I have to brush
my teeth.

923
00:44:35,407 --> 00:44:38,675
- I'm really sorry
for getting worked up earlier.

924
00:44:38,677 --> 00:44:40,843
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

925
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,847
Look, I promise
I'll be out of your hair

926
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,115
first thing in the morning.

927
00:44:46,117 --> 00:44:48,751
-You're not the problem.

928
00:44:48,753 --> 00:44:51,320
It's my marriage.

929
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:53,489
My marriage is so screwed up.

930
00:44:53,491 --> 00:44:57,393
I'll probably get divorced
and I'll die alone.

931
00:44:58,663 --> 00:45:01,364
And that asshole can
just move on to someone new,

932
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:04,267
but what about me?

933
00:45:04,269 --> 00:45:06,302
I'm 45.

934
00:45:06,304 --> 00:45:08,371
Soon, I'll be 50.

935
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:10,173
Nobody takes 50-year-olds
seriously

936
00:45:10,175 --> 00:45:11,774
because they're not a threat.

937
00:45:11,776 --> 00:45:14,310
-You're very threatening, okay?

938
00:45:14,312 --> 00:45:15,378
And, hey.

939
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:19,415
You can easily pass for 37.

940
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,885
-37?

941
00:45:22,887 --> 00:45:24,454
-37.

942
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:27,657
See?

943
00:45:27,659 --> 00:45:29,525
It's not all that bad.

944
00:45:29,527 --> 00:45:31,060
-It's bad.

945
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:34,130
He doesn't touch me anymore.

946
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:37,233
I can't remember
the last time that he kissed me.

947
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:40,403
And I need that.

948
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,772
I need to be kissed,
and I need to be touched,

949
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,140
and I need to be appreciated

950
00:45:44,142 --> 00:45:46,109
after everything I've given up
for this family.

951
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,711
- You've done a lot.
Yes, it's awful. It's unfair.

952
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:51,547
But you have to trust me.
You have to... look at me.

953
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:52,782
Y-you're gonna be fine.

954
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:55,585
He never even admitted it,

955
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:56,853
even though I knew

956
00:45:56,855 --> 00:45:58,621
that he was going outside
our marriage.

957
00:45:58,623 --> 00:46:00,156
You know, time goes on.

958
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,591
I stop bringing it up
because after a little while,

959
00:46:01,593 --> 00:46:03,926
I start feeling
like I'm the bad person

960
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,695
for harping on something
he never confessed to.

961
00:46:05,697 --> 00:46:06,996
-So tell phil how you feel.

962
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,564
I mean,
tell him how you really feel.

963
00:46:08,566 --> 00:46:09,599
And who knows?

964
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:10,833
Maybe you guys work things out

965
00:46:10,835 --> 00:46:12,101
and you move on together,
or you don't

966
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,503
and you move on separately.

967
00:46:13,505 --> 00:46:14,871
But at least you have closure,
and... and...

968
00:46:14,873 --> 00:46:16,305
and in any case, you move on.

969
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:18,808
- Maybe none of this
is meant to be.

970
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:22,578
You, me, phil...

971
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,381
Grace.

972
00:46:28,152 --> 00:46:30,219
-Or maybe it's a sign

973
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,122
that things just need fixing.

974
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:51,541
-Hey.

975
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,351
Everything okay?

976
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:04,086
-Yeah.

977
00:47:04,088 --> 00:47:09,392
Just had to floss and...
Those hard-to-reach places.

978
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:15,331
- I'm really happy
you're staying the night.

979
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:23,039
-I'm happy, too.

980
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,187
-Nice shot.

981
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:12,555
-Thank you.

982
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:33,242
-Sometimes, I think simon sleeps

983
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,777
with a nine iron
under his pillow.

984
00:48:36,281 --> 00:48:40,016
- Yeah, he takes his golf
pretty seriously.

985
00:48:40,018 --> 00:48:41,584
-Yeah.

986
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:43,386
It's just a game.

987
00:48:48,325 --> 00:48:51,727
Seems like grace
really likes you.

988
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:53,663
You like her?

989
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:57,733
-Confidentially?

990
00:48:57,735 --> 00:48:58,734
-Absolutely.

991
00:48:58,736 --> 00:49:00,736
- I like her.
- Good.

992
00:49:00,738 --> 00:49:04,407
- I like her more than I've liked
any other girl before.

993
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:07,143
- Think it's love?
- Oh.

994
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:08,744
I've only told one other girl
that I loved her,

995
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:11,881
and that did not end the way
that I expected it to, so...

996
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:14,483
- Yeah, they don't always.

997
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,218
Ah.

998
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,322
- Do you think
your relationship with maren...

999
00:49:19,324 --> 00:49:20,756
-do I think it's gonna end?

1000
00:49:20,758 --> 00:49:23,559
- I was gonna say,
"do you think it's gonna last?"

1001
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:27,730
I'm... all this...
all this tension

1002
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:29,899
you're feeling
between you and maren,

1003
00:49:29,901 --> 00:49:31,100
I think
if you really talk to her,

1004
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:33,102
like, really listened,
it'd be good.

1005
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,137
- Well, I talk.

1006
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,405
I talk.

1007
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:38,574
The problem is
that she doesn't listen.

1008
00:49:38,576 --> 00:49:43,346
- Have you thought about...
Just letting her talk?

1009
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:47,817
-How's that a conversation?

1010
00:49:51,254 --> 00:49:53,089
-Phil, I... I honestly think

1011
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:54,523
that women
sometimes don't want us

1012
00:49:54,525 --> 00:49:56,592
to have all the answers,
you know?

1013
00:49:56,594 --> 00:50:00,162
It's... it's like
doing nothing for them

1014
00:50:00,164 --> 00:50:02,264
is better
than just saying anything

1015
00:50:02,266 --> 00:50:04,233
to say something to them.

1016
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:07,570
Think about it. What do they...
what do they really want?

1017
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:11,040
They want us...
To pay attention to them,

1018
00:50:11,042 --> 00:50:12,942
to... to touch them

1019
00:50:12,944 --> 00:50:15,177
and to show them affection

1020
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:19,148
and... Kiss them.

1021
00:50:19,883 --> 00:50:22,385
-Yes! Yes!

1022
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:24,320
Okay, harry. You're up.

1023
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:26,789
- I don't know.
I'm just speaking out loud.

1024
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:52,248
-What's wrong?

1025
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,150
-What do you mean?

1026
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,319
-You never buy me flowers.

1027
00:50:57,321 --> 00:51:01,590
-Oh, well, I... I... Thought

1028
00:51:01,592 --> 00:51:03,959
maybe the house could use
a little color.

1029
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,730
-They're nice.

1030
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:09,932
-No flowers for me?

1031
00:51:11,435 --> 00:51:14,437
- I thought the flowers
were for the whole house.

1032
00:51:14,439 --> 00:51:17,306
- Oh. It's okay.

1033
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:23,245
- I got to take this call.
I'll be right back.

1034
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:36,358
- How deep are you in
mother/daughter ass right now?

1035
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,893
- I-I... dude,
I can't do this anymore, man.

1036
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:39,328
I got to tell grace
what happened.

1037
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,629
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, amigo.

1038
00:51:40,631 --> 00:51:41,664
Bad idea.

1039
00:51:41,666 --> 00:51:43,132
- I feel like
a complete hypocrite.

1040
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,434
- Here I am, I'm...
I'm dishing out marital advice

1041
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:46,936
to maren and her...
and her husband

1042
00:51:46,938 --> 00:51:48,604
about how they should
communicate openly and honestly,

1043
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:49,905
and I can't even look grace
in the face

1044
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:51,440
and tell her what happened.

1045
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,709
- Dude, you don't know
what the mom or will not say,

1046
00:51:53,711 --> 00:51:55,511
but you're definitely
gonna sabotage

1047
00:51:55,513 --> 00:51:58,447
any chance with this girl
if you tell her the truth.

1048
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,216
- I cannot be in a relationship
based on dishonesty.

1049
00:52:00,218 --> 00:52:01,884
It's against my principles.

1050
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:04,653
- That is totally your fear of
commitment talking right now.

1051
00:52:04,655 --> 00:52:08,157
- Jared, if I don't tell her,
I need to end things with her.

1052
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:10,259
That's where I'm at right now.

1053
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:12,294
- Have you guys noticed
anything...

1054
00:52:12,296 --> 00:52:14,029
Strange about harry?

1055
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:16,799
-Harry? No.

1056
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,100
-I've noticed.

1057
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:19,135
- You have?
- You have?

1058
00:52:19,137 --> 00:52:20,903
-Well, yeah,

1059
00:52:20,905 --> 00:52:22,671
but that's because he told me
that, um...

1060
00:52:22,673 --> 00:52:25,040
-Well, what did he tell you?

1061
00:52:25,042 --> 00:52:27,076
-Oh, well, it's just...

1062
00:52:27,078 --> 00:52:29,145
just guy talk, you know?

1063
00:52:29,147 --> 00:52:31,580
Man-to-man. Mano a mano.

1064
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:34,416
- I think I put too much pressure
on him by having him meet you.

1065
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:36,285
- Well,
he was gonna meet me, anyway.

1066
00:52:36,287 --> 00:52:38,254
- I think he's gonna break up
with me.

1067
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:40,923
- What? No!
No, he really likes you.

1068
00:52:40,925 --> 00:52:42,958
- Maybe he's pretending
to like you

1069
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,093
so dad will hire him.

1070
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:46,595
- Liz.
- No, that makes sense.

1071
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:49,365
He's been acting
really weird and distant.

1072
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,502
- I probably
shouldn't tell you this

1073
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:55,371
because he said it
in confidence,

1074
00:52:55,373 --> 00:52:58,107
but he told me he's never felt
about anyone

1075
00:52:58,109 --> 00:52:59,875
the way he feels about you.

1076
00:52:59,877 --> 00:53:01,177
- He said that?
- He said that?

1077
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,912
-Yeah.

1078
00:53:02,914 --> 00:53:06,415
He said he's never liked any
girl as much as he likes you.

1079
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:13,923
- Sweetheart, why don't you take
liz dress shopping

1080
00:53:13,925 --> 00:53:15,157
for kate's party?

1081
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,458
-Okay.

1082
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,928
I'll see if harry wants to go.

1083
00:53:19,896 --> 00:53:21,397
Come on. Shopping.

1084
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:28,437
We need to talk.

1085
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,943
- "Grace,
I want to tell you something

1086
00:53:33,945 --> 00:53:35,945
and I don't want you
to get mad."

1087
00:53:35,947 --> 00:53:37,613
That's awful.

1088
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:39,315
"Grace, I got to tell you
something.

1089
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:40,916
"Please don't judge me.

1090
00:53:40,918 --> 00:53:43,219
"Look, I'm just gonna be honest
with you.

1091
00:53:43,221 --> 00:53:44,787
"I need to tell you something.

1092
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:46,488
-Harry?

1093
00:53:46,490 --> 00:53:48,290
Are you okay?

1094
00:53:48,292 --> 00:53:51,460
-Yeah.

1095
00:53:51,462 --> 00:53:53,829
I need to tell you something.

1096
00:53:55,498 --> 00:53:56,999
And what I'm gonna say

1097
00:53:57,001 --> 00:54:01,337
is going to change
our relationship significantly.

1098
00:54:01,339 --> 00:54:03,973
-I know.

1099
00:54:03,975 --> 00:54:05,574
I'm ready.

1100
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:15,351
- Why don't you tell me what
you think it is I'm gonna say?

1101
00:54:15,353 --> 00:54:17,119
-It's okay.

1102
00:54:17,121 --> 00:54:20,889
I'm scared to verbalize it, too.

1103
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,994
I love you, too.

1104
00:54:26,631 --> 00:54:28,864
There. I said it.

1105
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,701
-Me, too.

1106
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:36,605
-I mean, I'm game to...

1107
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:40,342
to have an honest, uh,
discussion with you.

1108
00:54:40,344 --> 00:54:43,112
About us.

1109
00:54:43,114 --> 00:54:45,414
-Oh.

1110
00:54:45,416 --> 00:54:47,149
Okay.

1111
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:52,554
Well...

1112
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:03,465
I still haven't recovered
from your affair.

1113
00:55:05,102 --> 00:55:10,572
Honey,
I thought we got through this.

1114
00:55:10,574 --> 00:55:12,207
- No, because you never admitted
to it.

1115
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:15,177
- Well, it's because
nothing ever happened.

1116
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:19,181
Here we go again.

1117
00:55:19,183 --> 00:55:20,549
-Why are we talking

1118
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,484
about stuff from two years ago?

1119
00:55:22,486 --> 00:55:24,987
-19 months.

1120
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:28,590
And I thought you said
nothing happened.

1121
00:55:31,061 --> 00:55:32,461
What's wrong with you?

1122
00:55:32,463 --> 00:55:34,763
Is it... is it...
is it because you think

1123
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:36,965
I'm gonna pack my bags and leave

1124
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:39,668
if you tell me
what I already know?

1125
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,037
- All right, we kissed once.

1126
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:43,972
- But I think
I already told you that.

1127
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:47,810
- Yeah, who kisses someone once
at our age?

1128
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:50,546
- Well, that's...
that's what we did.

1129
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:52,114
Just once.

1130
00:55:52,116 --> 00:55:53,816
-For the love of christ.

1131
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,453
Please.

1132
00:55:57,455 --> 00:55:59,688
Just tell me the truth.

1133
00:56:04,127 --> 00:56:05,894
-Okay.

1134
00:56:08,164 --> 00:56:10,366
I had an affair.

1135
00:56:10,368 --> 00:56:14,536
And it was a horrible mistake.

1136
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:18,774
And I promise you that nothing
like that has happened since.

1137
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:34,256
Did you have sex with her
in our bedroom?

1138
00:56:34,258 --> 00:56:35,891
-No. Never.

1139
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:38,927
-Did you tell her you loved her?

1140
00:56:38,929 --> 00:56:40,562
-No. No way.

1141
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,137
Did she give you blow jobs?

1142
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,840
- That's ridiculous.

1143
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:52,641
-No.

1144
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,176
- Yeah.
- No, no.

1145
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,678
You don't get to do that.

1146
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,447
It's my right to know this shit,

1147
00:56:58,449 --> 00:56:59,782
and you're gonna sit there,

1148
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:02,384
and you're gonna answer
my ridiculous questions.

1149
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,124
Did she give you blow jobs?

1150
00:57:12,228 --> 00:57:14,863
- Yes.

1151
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:17,599
-Did you like them?

1152
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:19,668
-Yeah, I liked them.

1153
00:57:21,304 --> 00:57:23,405
-More than mine?

1154
00:57:23,407 --> 00:57:24,873
-No.

1155
00:57:25,675 --> 00:57:28,143
But they were more frequent.

1156
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:33,615
-Why did it end?

1157
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,983
-Because she was pressuring me,

1158
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:36,685
and there was no way in hell

1159
00:57:36,687 --> 00:57:38,854
that I was gonna leave you
for her.

1160
00:57:38,856 --> 00:57:40,055
-So she broke it off.

1161
00:57:40,057 --> 00:57:41,657
- No, I broke it off.
- Mm.

1162
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:44,092
You kept it going.
- No. I broke it off.

1163
00:57:44,094 --> 00:57:45,894
Look, I told you
that I liked her blow jobs.

1164
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,596
Why would I lie about this?

1165
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,965
I swear to you, I broke it off.

1166
00:57:54,738 --> 00:57:57,072
I slept with someone
in new york.

1167
00:57:57,074 --> 00:57:59,274
Last month.

1168
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,382
Why can't you get angry?

1169
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:11,019
I hate it when you don't show
your feelings.

1170
00:58:14,692 --> 00:58:16,592
-Who was he?

1171
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,371
-It was a guy I met.

1172
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:33,108
It lasted a weekend.

1173
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,280
And I have to tell you,

1174
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:40,649
I feel like...

1175
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:43,886
I feel like
I want to do that again.

1176
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,459
-I don't want that.

1177
00:58:50,461 --> 00:58:51,660
-Why not?

1178
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:56,398
There's no need
to keep up appearances here.

1179
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,766
It's an empty house.

1180
00:58:57,768 --> 00:58:58,934
Kids are gone.

1181
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,904
-I know this is just...

1182
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:06,141
Some sort of delayed reaction
because of what I did.

1183
00:59:06,143 --> 00:59:08,944
I get it.

1184
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,281
But I-I believe we can fix this.

1185
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:19,855
Because I still love you.

1186
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:24,359
You're the only person
that I want to see

1187
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:26,695
before I close my eyes at night.

1188
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:30,132
- And I'm not looking
for anybody else.

1189
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,137
-I want to grow old with you.

1190
00:59:39,276 --> 00:59:42,411
Where's this coming from?

1191
00:59:42,413 --> 00:59:44,680
-My heart.

1192
00:59:47,183 --> 00:59:50,385
And I-I did have some time
on the couch

1193
00:59:50,387 --> 00:59:52,487
to think about
this sort of stuff.

1194
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:50,846
I'm sorry about that
little freak out last night.

1195
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:53,148
But I took your advice.

1196
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,783
-And?

1197
01:00:54,785 --> 01:00:57,352
-Well, I, um...

1198
01:00:58,621 --> 01:01:02,858
I think phil and I just had
an honest conversation,

1199
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:04,793
and that was really unexpected.

1200
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:07,829
- I'm gonna tell grace
what happened.

1201
01:01:07,831 --> 01:01:10,799
-What?

1202
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:13,735
-I can't do this anymore, maren.

1203
01:01:13,737 --> 01:01:17,406
I can't hide this from her.
It's eating away at me inside.

1204
01:01:17,408 --> 01:01:18,408
-W-why would you do that?

1205
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:20,075
Why would you deliberately
hurt her?

1206
01:01:20,077 --> 01:01:21,997
- I feel like I'm hurting her
by not telling her.

1207
01:01:22,913 --> 01:01:24,880
- This is something I can't
not be honest about.

1208
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:27,215
-Oh, screw honesty!

1209
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:30,552
What is the point
of telling her?

1210
01:01:30,554 --> 01:01:33,955
-She told me she loves me.

1211
01:01:36,427 --> 01:01:39,494
- And I feel guilty that I'm
pretending this didn't happen

1212
01:01:39,496 --> 01:01:41,963
and walking around
under the cloud of this mistake.

1213
01:01:44,101 --> 01:01:47,536
You cannot tell her.

1214
01:01:47,538 --> 01:01:50,939
You cannot tell grace.

1215
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:57,045
- This would have been
so much easier if we hadn't met.

1216
01:02:00,718 --> 01:02:02,050
I'm sorry.

1217
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,039
Oh, shit.

1218
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:32,374
Oh, shit, shit, shit.

1219
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:48,957
-Ooh, I like them both.

1220
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,460
-Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.

1221
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:05,073
Let me take a picture
and send it to mom.

1222
01:04:10,279 --> 01:04:14,282
- Â¶<i> Talk to me,</i>
<i>you talk to me</i> Â¶

1223
01:04:14,284 --> 01:04:16,017
- mom? What are you doing here?
- Hi, girls.

1224
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,552
Well, I just thought I'd come by

1225
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:19,521
so we can do some shopping
and have some fun.

1226
01:04:19,523 --> 01:04:22,357
- Harry just broke up with me.
- What?

1227
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:24,025
- Yeah, he couldn't even do it
in person.

1228
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:25,861
He just did it
through an e-mail.

1229
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:27,863
It... it doesn't say

1230
01:04:27,865 --> 01:04:29,231
he's breaking up with you.

1231
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:31,967
I-I-I...
this e-mail is very vague.

1232
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:33,268
-Mom, are you crazy?

1233
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:35,237
He says he doesn't feel
the same way.

1234
01:04:35,239 --> 01:04:37,939
- It says... it says he wants
to remain friends,

1235
01:04:37,941 --> 01:04:38,940
and that's positive.

1236
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:40,742
-Just stop.

1237
01:04:40,744 --> 01:04:42,110
I'm an idiot.

1238
01:04:42,112 --> 01:04:43,345
-No, no, no, sweetie.

1239
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:44,546
Don't cry. Don't...
please don't cry.

1240
01:04:44,548 --> 01:04:45,747
- I should have just
listened to you.

1241
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:46,982
-You know what?

1242
01:04:46,984 --> 01:04:48,583
I'm actually starting
to like him now,

1243
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,886
and I think this is just
a little bit of healthy dialog.

1244
01:04:50,888 --> 01:04:52,721
- Dialog?
- Yes.

1245
01:04:52,723 --> 01:04:54,155
-He couldn't even call me!

1246
01:04:54,157 --> 01:04:55,924
- He dumped you.
Why would he call you?

1247
01:04:55,926 --> 01:04:57,025
-Liz, please. No.

1248
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,393
He didn't call you because...

1249
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,228
because...
because he didn't mean it.

1250
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,563
- Oh, he didn't mean it?
- He didn't mean it.

1251
01:05:01,565 --> 01:05:03,765
- He didn't mean it?
- He didn't mean it.

1252
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:05,767
-Wait a minute.

1253
01:05:05,769 --> 01:05:07,302
He didn't mean it.

1254
01:05:07,304 --> 01:05:08,370
-He didn't mean it.

1255
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:10,672
-No, he didn't even say it.

1256
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:15,410
I said, "I love you,"
and he said, "I do, too."

1257
01:05:15,412 --> 01:05:17,779
I am so stupid.

1258
01:05:17,781 --> 01:05:19,180
-No, no, no, sweetie.

1259
01:05:19,182 --> 01:05:20,982
I'm sure this is just
one big misunderstanding.

1260
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:23,018
That's all it is.
- No, it's not.

1261
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,419
I can't even be here right now.

1262
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:27,122
- No, grace.
- I'm going back to the city.

1263
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:53,248
-Asshole.

1264
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,422
- Did you tell grace
what happened?

1265
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,091
-Why would I tell grace?

1266
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:05,794
- Maren, she just sent me a text
calling me a manipulative liar.

1267
01:06:05,796 --> 01:06:07,395
She won't take
any of my phone calls. Please.

1268
01:06:07,397 --> 01:06:09,297
- Well,
I just talked to her, and...

1269
01:06:10,901 --> 01:06:14,269
she was, um, shaken

1270
01:06:14,271 --> 01:06:17,138
by your emotional indifference
earlier today.

1271
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,641
- Everything was fine with us
an hour ago.

1272
01:06:19,643 --> 01:06:21,810
-Was it?

1273
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:23,712
She didn't feel
you were being genuine.

1274
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:26,047
-About what?

1275
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:28,216
-About being in love.

1276
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:33,989
If you don't love her,
just let her go.

1277
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:37,659
At least you don't have to hurt
her feelings with the truth.

1278
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:59,147
-Harry!

1279
01:06:59,149 --> 01:07:01,616
Hey, you leaving already?

1280
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,487
- I just got off the phone
with simon.

1281
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:09,457
I figured you'd want to know
he made a decision.

1282
01:07:09,459 --> 01:07:11,993
We'd love to have you
on our team.

1283
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:15,663
H.R. Is gonna be sending you
some paperwork to look over,

1284
01:07:15,665 --> 01:07:16,798
okay?

1285
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:19,134
Congratulations.

1286
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:20,535
-Thank you.

1287
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:40,982
- She... she likes peaches.
- Is that right?

1288
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:43,885
- Happy graduation!
I'm so proud of you.

1289
01:08:43,887 --> 01:08:45,153
-Thank you.

1290
01:08:45,155 --> 01:08:46,187
Thanks, guys.

1291
01:08:47,256 --> 01:08:49,624
- They're the exact, same thing.
It would be, like...

1292
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:51,626
-hold on one second. Sorry.

1293
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:57,999
-Yeah.

1294
01:08:58,001 --> 01:08:59,868
Are we still going on his boat?

1295
01:08:59,870 --> 01:09:02,737
- I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

1296
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:06,007
You know, grace hasn't returned
my phone calls.

1297
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:08,409
-What's he doing here?

1298
01:09:08,411 --> 01:09:11,412
- Well, I-I invited harry,
sweetheart.

1299
01:09:11,414 --> 01:09:13,148
I-I thought
it might be a good idea

1300
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:15,383
for him to talk to grace.

1301
01:09:16,753 --> 01:09:19,087
What if grace
doesn't want to talk to him?

1302
01:09:19,089 --> 01:09:20,588
-Phil. You got a second?

1303
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:22,457
- Oh, hey, mario.
- Somebody I want you to meet.

1304
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:24,325
- All right,
hold on a second, harry.

1305
01:09:25,528 --> 01:09:27,595
- I just want to talk to grace.
That's all.

1306
01:09:27,597 --> 01:09:29,697
- Yeah. And tell her about us.

1307
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:31,099
- I'm not gonna tell her
about us, maren.

1308
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:32,534
- Really?
- Yes.

1309
01:09:33,702 --> 01:09:35,904
Maren, this has been
the worst week of my life.

1310
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:41,509
Please. I'm not gonna cause
any problems.

1311
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:59,527
Look...

1312
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:01,763
I know you don't want
to talk to me right now,

1313
01:10:01,765 --> 01:10:05,433
but I just wanted to say that...

1314
01:10:05,435 --> 01:10:06,768
I was scared to say
how I truly felt

1315
01:10:06,770 --> 01:10:08,269
back at your parents' house.

1316
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:11,639
I was afraid of getting
too close and getting hurt

1317
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:13,208
and I was a coward,

1318
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:15,376
but that's why I'm here now,

1319
01:10:15,378 --> 01:10:17,779
to tell you how I really feel.

1320
01:10:20,282 --> 01:10:22,550
Grace, I love you,

1321
01:10:22,552 --> 01:10:24,118
and I know this is real

1322
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,954
because the thought of losing
you hurts me so much

1323
01:10:25,956 --> 01:10:30,191
that I can't sleep, I can't eat,
I can't even think straight.

1324
01:10:30,193 --> 01:10:31,693
I know you're mad at me,

1325
01:10:31,695 --> 01:10:34,395
and I'm sorry
for showing up unannounced,

1326
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,465
but I really wanted to come here
and talk to you.

1327
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,876
-I'm so happy that you came.

1328
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:01,422
- I feel so close to you
right now.

1329
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,657
- I feel like
I've never been closer

1330
01:11:02,659 --> 01:11:04,292
to anybody else
in my entire life.

1331
01:11:04,294 --> 01:11:07,829
I-I feel like I always want us
to just share how we feel and...

1332
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:10,198
and just be open
so that we never get hurt.

1333
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,333
- Yes! Grace, I don't ever
want to hurt you again.

1334
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:15,036
- Yeah, no more secrets.
- I want to tell you everything.

1335
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:16,938
- And... and never keep anything
from each other.

1336
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,940
- No more secrets.
- Yeah, no more secrets.

1337
01:11:18,942 --> 01:11:21,643
- Before we started dating,
I slept with your mother.

1338
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,146
- What?
- I know.

1339
01:11:25,148 --> 01:11:27,715
That night that I met you,
after I walked you home,

1340
01:11:27,717 --> 01:11:29,050
I went to a hotel bar,

1341
01:11:29,052 --> 01:11:30,585
and she was there,
and that's how we met.

1342
01:11:30,587 --> 01:11:31,886
And I'm just...

1343
01:11:31,888 --> 01:11:33,154
I want to lay this
all out there now

1344
01:11:33,156 --> 01:11:34,389
so that we can just get past it

1345
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:35,757
and it won't come back
to haunt us.

1346
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:37,992
We can just move forward
and be happy together.

1347
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:42,430
-You had sex with my mom?

1348
01:11:42,432 --> 01:11:43,798
-It was a-a tiny mistake that...

1349
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:45,233
that just happened
that one weekend.

1350
01:11:45,235 --> 01:11:46,501
But... but I'm glad
I'm telling you this now.

1351
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:48,202
-You had sex with my mom.

1352
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:50,004
- I'm... I'm glad I'm getting
this off my chest,

1353
01:11:50,006 --> 01:11:51,673
'cause I don't want to hide
this from you anymore and...

1354
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:53,841
-you sex with my mom?!

1355
01:11:53,843 --> 01:11:55,443
Why are you telling me this?!

1356
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,011
-I was under the assumption

1357
01:11:57,013 --> 01:11:58,479
that we are going to be honest
with each other.

1358
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,548
- Not about this!
- About everything.

1359
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:13,127
-Sweetheart, what's going on?

1360
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:18,466
-Oh.

1361
01:12:23,806 --> 01:12:24,672
-Grace.

1362
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,841
Don't leave! Grace!

1363
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:37,085
No, I know, sweetie.

1364
01:12:37,087 --> 01:12:38,553
I know.

1365
01:12:38,555 --> 01:12:41,089
Well, why don't you try
to talk to her?

1366
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:44,258
Okay.

1367
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:46,294
No, I understand.

1368
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:49,430
Well,
try to get some rest tonight,

1369
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:52,633
and we'll talk in the morning,
okay?

1370
01:12:53,902 --> 01:12:55,603
I love you, too.

1371
01:12:55,605 --> 01:12:57,071
All right, good night.

1372
01:12:58,608 --> 01:13:01,042
-I've made up the couch.

1373
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:03,978
-You're kidding.

1374
01:13:04,947 --> 01:13:06,247
-It's for me.

1375
01:13:06,249 --> 01:13:08,049
I'll sleep downstairs.

1376
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:09,684
-Maren.

1377
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:11,886
Wait a minute.

1378
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,265
-How is she?

1379
01:13:25,435 --> 01:13:27,835
-Well, she is very upset.

1380
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,676
-Does she hate me?

1381
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,290
I've been saving the good stuff

1382
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:52,794
for a, uh, special occasion.

1383
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:06,240
You fucked harry.

1384
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:11,479
-Truly sorry.

1385
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:25,660
- You fucked
your daughter's boyfriend.

1386
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:36,337
You fucked
your daughter's boyfriend.

1387
01:14:36,339 --> 01:14:38,239
That's...

1388
01:15:02,898 --> 01:15:03,698
stop it.

1389
01:15:03,700 --> 01:15:04,699
-I can't help it.

1390
01:15:05,768 --> 01:15:08,469
- It's amazing.

1391
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:10,238
-That's just...

1392
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,544
-how could you do that to dad?

1393
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:25,880
-You're right. I'm sorry.

1394
01:16:25,882 --> 01:16:27,348
Dad's perfect.

1395
01:16:29,051 --> 01:16:31,052
-What are you saying?

1396
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:39,493
I knew it.

1397
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:43,531
I knew something was going on
with you guys.

1398
01:16:43,533 --> 01:16:46,000
-We screwed up, sweetie.

1399
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:48,035
We both screwed up.

1400
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:52,039
We took each other for granted.

1401
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:56,310
You know, people think
just because you have kids,

1402
01:16:56,312 --> 01:16:58,446
you somehow know
what you're doing.

1403
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:03,551
As if having a family
makes you perfect, right?

1404
01:17:03,553 --> 01:17:06,454
It doesn't.

1405
01:17:06,456 --> 01:17:07,822
It's hard.

1406
01:17:07,824 --> 01:17:10,825
It's hard work.

1407
01:17:10,827 --> 01:17:13,894
And I'm not saying having
an affair is the answer,

1408
01:17:13,896 --> 01:17:15,997
because it's not.

1409
01:17:17,532 --> 01:17:21,135
Sometimes it takes
almost losing something

1410
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,772
to make you remember why
you left it in the first place.

1411
01:17:28,910 --> 01:17:31,846
Sweetie,
I know you care about him.

1412
01:17:31,848 --> 01:17:34,315
All he did
was tell you the truth.

1413
01:17:36,051 --> 01:17:40,388
- Every time I open myself up
to him, he hurts me.

1414
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:44,625
Whether it's him...
Telling me about you

1415
01:17:44,627 --> 01:17:47,294
or writing me an e-mail
to break up with me.

1416
01:17:47,296 --> 01:17:48,863
-I wrote that.

1417
01:17:50,165 --> 01:17:51,298
It wasn't supposed to get sent.

1418
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,767
That... that part
was an accident,

1419
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:55,102
but... but I wrote it.

1420
01:17:55,104 --> 01:17:57,505
He was gonna tell you
everything.

1421
01:17:57,507 --> 01:18:00,408
And I... I-I-I panicked.

1422
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:02,376
I love you so much.

1423
01:18:02,378 --> 01:18:05,046
And I-I-I couldn't bear
the thought of hurting you,

1424
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:09,650
and, of course, then I ended up
hurting you, and...

1425
01:18:09,652 --> 01:18:11,385
I am so sorry.

1426
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,792
-That is so fucked up.

1427
01:18:17,794 --> 01:18:19,927
-So fucked up.

1428
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:28,302
Look.

1429
01:18:28,304 --> 01:18:30,171
He wanted to be with you so bad

1430
01:18:30,173 --> 01:18:32,540
that he was willing
to risk losing you.

1431
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:35,142
-So?

1432
01:18:35,144 --> 01:18:38,345
I... what do you want me to do?

1433
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,482
I don't know what to do.

1434
01:18:41,484 --> 01:18:44,085
- I'm saying
do what makes you happy.

1435
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,203
- Whoo!

1436
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,509
-It's okay. It's okay.

1437
01:19:09,878 --> 01:19:11,178
Just getting warmed up.

1438
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:13,280
You are just getting warmed up.

1439
01:19:17,652 --> 01:19:19,587
-Whoo! Yes!

1440
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:21,522
Whoo! Yeah!

1441
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:24,058
That's how you do it!

1442
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:26,627
You're the man! Whoo! Yeah!

1443
01:19:26,629 --> 01:19:29,563
- Hey, you ready
to make it happen, harry?

1444
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:10,137
- Okay, look, before you close
the door in my face,

1445
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:11,505
'cause I know you're mad

1446
01:20:11,507 --> 01:20:13,440
and you probably
don't want me here right now,

1447
01:20:13,442 --> 01:20:15,209
just let me
get this off my chest.

1448
01:20:15,211 --> 01:20:18,145
I've been thinking a lot
about you and me and...

1449
01:20:42,237 --> 01:20:45,039
I can't believe
we haven't had sex.

1450
01:20:45,041 --> 01:20:47,641
-Well, what are you waiting for?

1451
01:20:54,850 --> 01:20:58,385
-Â¶ All that I ask from you Â¶

1452
01:20:58,387 --> 01:21:03,991
Â¶ oh, baby, is the truth Â¶

1453
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:05,993
Â¶ cruel to be kind, baby Â¶

1454
01:21:05,995 --> 01:21:09,163
Â¶ I ain't afraid of the blues Â¶

1455
01:21:09,165 --> 01:21:13,300
Â¶ 'cause I've been
down this road before Â¶

1456
01:21:13,302 --> 01:21:18,772
Â¶ and I'd rather less than more
of nothin' Â¶

1457
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:22,743
- Â¶ nothin', nothin', nothin',
nothin' Â¶

1458
01:21:23,979 --> 01:21:27,748
-Â¶ oh, baby, are you blind? Â¶

1459
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:31,685
Â¶ don't you know
that it's a crime Â¶

1460
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:34,722
Â¶ in this more-of-nothin' world
we live Â¶

1461
01:21:34,724 --> 01:21:38,559
Â¶ to have a more-of-nothin' love
to give? Â¶

1462
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:42,663
Â¶ I'm out fightin' it
every day Â¶

1463
01:21:42,665 --> 01:21:45,566
Â¶ and, honey,
there's just no way Â¶

1464
01:21:45,568 --> 01:21:49,236
Â¶ I'm comin' home
to more of nothin' Â¶

1465
01:21:49,238 --> 01:21:51,839
Â¶ nothin', nothin', nothin' Â¶

1466
01:21:51,841 --> 01:21:53,307
Â¶ no, no, no, no, no Â¶

1467
01:21:53,309 --> 01:21:56,210
Â¶ and I think you confused me Â¶

1468
01:21:56,212 --> 01:21:57,344
-Â¶ confused me Â¶

1469
01:21:57,346 --> 01:21:59,880
-Â¶ with one of those girls Â¶

1470
01:21:59,882 --> 01:22:01,448
Â¶ you run around with Â¶

1471
01:22:01,450 --> 01:22:04,118
Â¶ baby, I ain't trying to be Â¶

1472
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:05,552
-Â¶ trying to be Â¶

1473
01:22:05,554 --> 01:22:08,889
- Â¶ your next little thing,
starlet Â¶

1474
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:12,226
Â¶ I want a love that's deep Â¶

1475
01:22:12,228 --> 01:22:15,396
Â¶ and you keep buyin' cheap Â¶

1476
01:22:15,398 --> 01:22:18,032
Â¶ you're buyin'
more of nothin' Â¶

1477
01:22:18,034 --> 01:22:20,834
-Â¶ nothin', nothin', nothin' Â¶

1478
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:24,772
-Â¶ nothin' Â¶

1479
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:08,782
- Â¶ yes, well,
the years have all gone by Â¶

1480
01:23:10,185 --> 01:23:12,386
Â¶ and they've taken us Â¶

1481
01:23:12,388 --> 01:23:17,024
Â¶ they've taken us
for a very long ride Â¶

1482
01:23:17,026 --> 01:23:21,395
Â¶ some of us have
come and gone Â¶

1483
01:23:21,397 --> 01:23:26,767
Â¶ the rest of us
have tried to carry on Â¶

1484
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:29,903
-Â¶ ooh Â¶

1485
01:23:29,905 --> 01:23:34,375
- Â¶ yeah, well,
the years have come and gone Â¶

1486
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:38,545
Â¶ and what have we Â¶

1487
01:23:38,547 --> 01:23:42,583
Â¶ what have we all really done,
babe? Â¶

1488
01:23:42,585 --> 01:23:46,854
Â¶ some of us
have come and gone Â¶

1489
01:23:46,856 --> 01:23:53,527
- Â¶ the rest of us
will try to carry on Â¶

1490
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:57,097
- Â¶ and silently,
the years go by Â¶

1491
01:23:57,099 --> 01:24:00,734
Â¶ and they take you for a ride Â¶

1492
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:03,604
Â¶ you were there,
now you're not there Â¶

1493
01:24:03,606 --> 01:24:07,274
Â¶ you're no longer by my side Â¶

1494
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:12,079
-Â¶ and I, I don't know Â¶

1495
01:24:12,081 --> 01:24:15,749
Â¶ if this ride
is still for me Â¶

1496
01:24:22,624 --> 01:24:27,728
- Â¶ I remember
some time long ago Â¶

1497
01:24:29,130 --> 01:24:31,465
Â¶ when I saw your hair Â¶

1498
01:24:31,467 --> 01:24:35,569
Â¶ it was glistening all aglow Â¶
