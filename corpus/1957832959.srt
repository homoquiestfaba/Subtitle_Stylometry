1
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:18,405
Good morning
and happy November 1st.

2
00:02:18,438 --> 00:02:21,408
Developing story out of
Rabbit Hash, Ohio today

3
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,745
as authorities are seeking
information regarding

4
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:25,412
several missing persons,

5
00:02:25,445 --> 00:02:27,582
including a large number
of children that has

6
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,617
left locals panicking.

7
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:33,988
We have all the coverage
here at WKLB in the morning.

8
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,963
Detective
McKinney to forensics, please.

9
00:02:41,996 --> 00:02:44,599
Detective McKinney
to forensics, please.

10
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,705
Deputy Harper, you're
needed on level one.

11
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:53,641
Deputy Harper to
level one, please.

12
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,547
I just got off the
phone with their parents.

13
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,480
They're on the way.

14
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,752
Have you got anything
out of 'em yet?

15
00:03:04,786 --> 00:03:05,853
Nothing in a while.

16
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:07,320
The youngest seems out of it.

17
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:10,290
Probably still in shock.

18
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,363
We still can't find
those missing kids.

19
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:20,068
I think we're up
to about 13 now.

20
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:23,604
What happened to them two?

21
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:27,240
Well, we picked them up
wandering aimlessly down the road.

22
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,443
The only thing we could
get out of 'em was

23
00:03:29,476 --> 00:03:33,246
some evil lady in a hat
and some Halloween ghouls

24
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,481
took their friends.

25
00:03:34,515 --> 00:03:35,717
What's with the board?

26
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,453
That I don't know about.

27
00:03:39,486 --> 00:03:44,058
But, mmm, probably a
favorite toy or something.

28
00:03:44,092 --> 00:03:45,526
Well, let's get going.

29
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,394
These missing kids aren't
gonna find themselves.

30
00:03:47,427 --> 00:03:49,831
This time of year is the
worst. I hate Halloween.

31
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:51,532
Right. Trick or treat.

32
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:55,803
No one believes us.

33
00:03:55,837 --> 00:03:59,040
We have to make sure
what happened to us

34
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,142
never happens again.

35
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,610
How?

36
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:07,247
By keeping this board out
of someone else's hands.

37
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:12,053
We closed the portal.

38
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,287
The gateway is sealed.

39
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:16,524
What if she comes back?

40
00:04:16,557 --> 00:04:18,492
She can't come back.

41
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:20,494
They can't come back.

42
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:23,531
Let's keep it that way.

43
00:04:36,811 --> 00:04:39,947
When you're a kid,
Halloween is about dressing up

44
00:04:39,981 --> 00:04:43,084
in costumes, getting candy,

45
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:45,352
pulling pranks,

46
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,022
and celebrating the spooky.

47
00:04:49,857 --> 00:04:52,527
You think the scary stuff
around you is all for fun

48
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,562
and that nothing can harm you.

49
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:59,332
The reality is that's not true.

50
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,571
♪ She's a know better ♪

51
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,372
♪ I don't wanna show better ♪

52
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:06,674
♪ Not a go-getter ♪

53
00:05:06,707 --> 00:05:08,643
♪ Just another gold getter ♪

54
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:09,911
♪ She's a know better ♪

55
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:11,846
♪ I don't wanna show better ♪

56
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,114
♪ She's a go-getter ♪

57
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:14,148
♪ Just another gold getter ♪

58
00:05:14,182 --> 00:05:15,283
Where you goin'?

59
00:05:16,884 --> 00:05:18,519
Nowhere, Benny.

60
00:05:18,553 --> 00:05:19,754
Absolutely nowhere.

61
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,990
You goin' somewhere?

62
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,091
Yes, unfortunately.

63
00:05:57,124 --> 00:05:59,492
I've been called in to work.

64
00:05:59,527 --> 00:06:00,995
One of the flight
attendants I guess quit,

65
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,698
so I'm gonna need for you
to watch your brothers.

66
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,565
Hard pass.

67
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,834
Miah.

68
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,203
Mom.

69
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:17,377
Mom, I have no life outside
of babysitting them.

70
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,547
Stokely is 15,
for Christ's sake.

71
00:06:20,715 --> 00:06:22,884
Did you have plans or
something for tonight?

72
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,886
No, I never have plans.

73
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:25,987
That's not the point.

74
00:06:27,755 --> 00:06:29,657
Then what is the point?

75
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:31,826
Look, help me out
a little here. Hmm?

76
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:36,764
I can't skip work.

77
00:06:36,797 --> 00:06:38,431
I need you to understand.

78
00:06:39,634 --> 00:06:41,535
You are now the
man of the house.

79
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,839
I don't want to be
the man of the house.

80
00:06:44,872 --> 00:06:46,173
I just wanna be Miah.

81
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,344
I know it has been hard
since we lost your dad.

82
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:52,013
We didn't lose.

83
00:06:53,347 --> 00:06:55,683
He ran off to Cancun
with his secretary.

84
00:06:58,586 --> 00:07:00,054
Same thing.

85
00:07:00,087 --> 00:07:02,857
And for all I care, I hope
he gets eaten by a shark.

86
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,559
Well, this blows, so.

87
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,730
Miah, please, please.

88
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,400
Fine. Fine.

89
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,267
Thank you.

90
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,370
Hey.
- Are you, uh, leaving?

91
00:07:16,404 --> 00:07:18,172
I am. I've been called in.

92
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:21,642
I need you to listen
to your brother.

93
00:07:21,676 --> 00:07:23,344
I need you to behave.

94
00:07:23,377 --> 00:07:25,112
- Okay.
- Please.

95
00:07:25,146 --> 00:07:26,213
Thank you.

96
00:07:26,247 --> 00:07:27,882
Guys, I'm runnin' late.

97
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,751
I love you all.

98
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:31,619
Love you, too.

99
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,366
Take care of them.

100
00:07:46,267 --> 00:07:47,435
I will.

101
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,970
- Bye.
- Bye.

102
00:07:50,938 --> 00:07:53,174
Well, what do you wanna do?

103
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:55,876
Come on, anus.

104
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,352
Yeah? Who is it?

105
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,553
It's Miah. Open up.

106
00:08:06,554 --> 00:08:07,989
What's the password?

107
00:08:08,022 --> 00:08:10,091
Eat shit and die.

108
00:08:14,295 --> 00:08:15,129
Lucky guess.

109
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,465
Cool.

110
00:08:22,436 --> 00:08:24,138
Whoa! What's this, Stokely?

111
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,639
There's boobs?

112
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,875
Yeah, it's a double version
of "Die, Die Babe Masker 4."

113
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:31,912
Do you have parts
one, two and three?

114
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:32,880
What do you mean?
Of course I do.

115
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:34,448
I own the whole series.

116
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,183
And you're not
watching any of them.

117
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:37,685
What? Why not?

118
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:39,053
I mean, Mom's gone, and it may
do the little guy some good.

119
00:08:39,086 --> 00:08:40,454
You know?

120
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:41,389
Because.

121
00:08:42,323 --> 00:08:43,958
No, no.
- What? Why not?

122
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:45,626
Come on. We're
going into town.

123
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,660
We're gonna rent us some
movies or something.

124
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,862
What?

125
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:48,662
Hopefully with
less crappy acting.

126
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:49,663
This is good acting.

127
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,531
Nope.

128
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:52,933
Hey, oh, can we stop by Mabry's?

129
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:54,268
There's something I
wanna show you guys.

130
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,505
Whatever.
Just hurry up.

131
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:59,940
Hey.

132
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,879
I'll show you later.
Just don't tell Miah.

133
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,027
Ooh. Hey!

134
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,163
Guess who I saw the other day.

135
00:09:22,196 --> 00:09:23,697
I don't know, Stoke. Who?

136
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,634
It was one Cammy Belanger.

137
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,868
Did you talk to her?

138
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:30,037
Oh yeah. I talked
to her for hours.

139
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:32,807
Talked about, let's see, school.

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,442
Uh, her bra size.
- There it is.

141
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:37,011
Whether she prefers to wear
underwear or go commando.

142
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,547
And, wait for this one,

143
00:09:38,579 --> 00:09:40,448
your super creepy
infatuation of her.

144
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:42,316
You're not funny, ass.

145
00:09:42,349 --> 00:09:44,452
Is that the girl whose picture
you're always staring at?

146
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:46,787
- Shut up, Benny!
- Dude, it totally is.

147
00:09:46,821 --> 00:09:48,656
I don't see why you haven't
asked her out already.

148
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:49,890
I don't know. Stoke.

149
00:09:49,924 --> 00:09:51,792
Maybe it's that she's
way outta my league.

150
00:09:51,826 --> 00:09:52,993
Ah.

151
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:53,928
Maybe it's her
dick of a boyfriend.

152
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:54,962
Man, screw Billy Masterson.

153
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,263
He's an idiot meat head.

154
00:09:56,297 --> 00:09:58,099
Idiot meat head with
a car and a license.

155
00:09:58,132 --> 00:10:00,535
Star running back that could
pummel us into oblivion.

156
00:10:00,569 --> 00:10:02,069
Man, who cares
what he does to hide

157
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,704
his fragile, little ego.

158
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:06,474
And plus, you and Cam
have history, bro.

159
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:09,877
Stokley, the class in the
fourth grade is not history.

160
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,178
End of conversation.

161
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,179
Have it your way.

162
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:16,484
He's your brother, not mine.

163
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:55,816
Lookie, lookie.

164
00:11:55,849 --> 00:11:57,586
What have we got here?

165
00:11:57,619 --> 00:11:59,588
Check out the nerd herd.

166
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:18,072
You might wanna be
careful on these little bikes.

167
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:19,574
It could be dangerous.

168
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:21,008
Stop. Let's go.

169
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,544
What? I'm just giving
these diaper stains

170
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:23,712
some friendly advice.

171
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,779
No, you're not. You're
being a douche bag.

172
00:12:27,848 --> 00:12:28,849
Are you guys okay?

173
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:30,117
I mean, I'm not.

174
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,185
That piece of trash
almost hit me, man.

175
00:12:33,887 --> 00:12:35,055
What did you just call my car?

176
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,323
You heard me. I called
it a piece of trash.

177
00:12:36,357 --> 00:12:37,726
No, I didn't quite
catch that, shit smear.

178
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,527
I think you know what I said.

179
00:12:42,096 --> 00:12:43,598
That's what I thought.

180
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:44,965
Enough.

181
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:47,101
Oh, shit!

182
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,869
Are you about to
do something, Mia?

183
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,175
Muzzle your little bitch
brother before I do.

184
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:56,277
Okay, Billy. Stop.

185
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:58,812
Come on.

186
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,149
Fine. Have it your way.

187
00:13:06,554 --> 00:13:07,656
Next time, dick wad.

188
00:13:09,524 --> 00:13:10,625
Come on, sweet tits.

189
00:13:15,062 --> 00:13:15,896
Boop.

190
00:13:24,104 --> 00:13:25,973
See, the best way to
handle Billy, just kick-

191
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:28,442
Just shut the hell up, Stokely.

192
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,613
I was just gonna say kick
him in the dick, I mean.

193
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:56,705
Welcome back
to our creature feature film.

194
00:13:56,738 --> 00:13:58,472
Hey, man.

195
00:13:58,506 --> 00:14:03,410
I was just, hey.

196
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:04,311
Is that weed?

197
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,651
- It's medicinal.
- Right.

198
00:14:09,684 --> 00:14:10,918
Got a PTSD thing.

199
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,221
I was just gonna show
my two lame brothers

200
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,790
all the cool stuff he got here.

201
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:17,057
Yeah, man, go ahead.

202
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:19,661
Just, you know, you
break it, you buy it.

203
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:21,696
All right.

204
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:22,963
Now I see why you
like this place so much.

205
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:24,599
Will you shut up?

206
00:14:29,838 --> 00:14:30,672
God.

207
00:14:39,113 --> 00:14:40,114
There it is.

208
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:42,216
What is it?

209
00:14:43,484 --> 00:14:44,418
It's right there.

210
00:14:45,653 --> 00:14:47,354
Okay, but what is it?

211
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,124
Somethin' catch your eye, guys?

212
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,358
Oh, no.

213
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,727
I was just showing them
your collection here.

214
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:53,595
Stokely.

215
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:57,297
I caught you staring at that
board several times this week.

216
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:59,166
What did I tell you last time?

217
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,934
- It's not for sale.
- Right.

218
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:02,336
Now if you guys are into
the weird macabre shit,

219
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:04,138
I've got plenty of other
stuff you can check out.

220
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:05,239
What is this supposed to be?

221
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,544
Those symbols look
Halloween-related or somethin'.

222
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,347
Yeah.

223
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,016
It's, uh, it's called
the board of Zawan.

224
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:18,986
In ancient times,
you know, Halloween,

225
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:22,923
Zawan was a time
that the boundaries

226
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:24,526
between dimensions
was the thinnest

227
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:27,127
and creatures could cross over

228
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:28,362
from one dimension to the next,

229
00:15:28,395 --> 00:15:32,232
and that, that's what
they used that for.

230
00:15:34,201 --> 00:15:36,036
You ever hear of
the Narnia Chronicles?

231
00:15:36,069 --> 00:15:37,772
In those it's a
wardrobe that opens.

232
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,273
Narnia, seriously?
What is wrong with you?

233
00:15:39,306 --> 00:15:41,643
Guys, this thing's cursed.

234
00:15:42,744 --> 00:15:44,178
All right, in fact
there's not much in here

235
00:15:44,211 --> 00:15:47,549
that isn't cursed or haunted
or tainted or somethin'.

236
00:15:47,582 --> 00:15:50,017
You ever thought about
seeing what the bad boy can do?

237
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:56,624
I'm sure you guys have
heard of the 13 kids

238
00:15:56,658 --> 00:15:58,959
that went missing
here 30 years ago.

239
00:15:58,992 --> 00:15:59,828
Well, yeah.

240
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:05,966
All of them had
contact with that board.

241
00:16:08,068 --> 00:16:09,637
All right?

242
00:16:09,671 --> 00:16:12,640
Screw with that thing,
it never ends well.

243
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:15,442
Leave it alone.

244
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:17,912
Okay.

245
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,387
We gotta get that thing.

246
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:28,857
- Nope.
- Come on.

247
00:16:36,731 --> 00:16:38,967
Guys, I'm all for
having a good time,

248
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:40,568
but do we really wanna do this?

249
00:16:40,602 --> 00:16:42,704
Dude, where is your
sense of adventure?

250
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:43,872
I don't know, Stoke.

251
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:45,573
Maybe my common sense
is obscuring it.

252
00:16:45,607 --> 00:16:47,509
Aren't you just a bit curious?

253
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:48,710
Curious of what?

254
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:49,878
If we can get away
with burglary?

255
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:51,311
No, what the hell it does.

256
00:16:51,345 --> 00:16:52,547
If it works.

257
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,147
I mean, Mabry said
that thing was tied

258
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:55,583
to all those disappearances,

259
00:16:55,617 --> 00:16:57,284
and that's like the only
thing this place is known for.

260
00:16:57,317 --> 00:16:59,419
All the more reason
not to mess with it.

261
00:16:59,453 --> 00:17:00,889
Hello.

262
00:17:00,922 --> 00:17:02,790
"Hell raiser," "Evil Dead,"
"Jumanji," "The Ring."

263
00:17:02,824 --> 00:17:04,324
All good movies.

264
00:17:04,358 --> 00:17:06,026
There's obviously a good
reason it's not for sale.

265
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,327
Come on, Miah.

266
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:09,363
We don't get to do
anything fun anymore.

267
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:17,204
You guys are gonna get us
into so much shit over this.

268
00:17:17,237 --> 00:17:19,039
So, uh, you in?

269
00:17:20,575 --> 00:17:21,943
I'm not stealin' anything.

270
00:17:21,976 --> 00:17:24,111
I'll keep watch or
whatever, but I refuse-

271
00:17:24,144 --> 00:17:25,980
What are you guys doing?

272
00:17:31,184 --> 00:17:32,286
Hey, Cammy.

273
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:35,757
You guys look like
you're plotting something

274
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:38,091
or scheming or whatever.

275
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,092
What are you doing?

276
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:41,696
No, we, no, we, um.

277
00:17:41,729 --> 00:17:44,164
We're trying to get
something from the store.

278
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:45,867
So go buy it.

279
00:17:48,002 --> 00:17:50,404
Wow, Paris, you're
like a genius.

280
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:52,941
If it were only that simple.

281
00:17:52,974 --> 00:17:55,610
See, the thing we're
after, he's not selling.

282
00:17:55,643 --> 00:17:58,813
We're going for a one,
two, five-finger discount.

283
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:00,982
So what is it?

284
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:04,451
It's this stupid
spirit port thing.

285
00:18:04,484 --> 00:18:05,385
It's dumb.

286
00:18:05,419 --> 00:18:07,589
Spirit port? Cool.

287
00:18:07,622 --> 00:18:08,623
Gross.

288
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,692
- Cool?
- Yeah, totally.

289
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,259
I love stuff like that.

290
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:13,126
You do?

291
00:18:18,032 --> 00:18:19,534
- We'll help.
- No, we won't.

292
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:22,036
You, mmm-hmm. Okay.

293
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:24,271
Um, you don't have to do this.

294
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,640
I was just going through
with it for my brothers.

295
00:18:25,673 --> 00:18:28,308
If we get caught, we're
gonna be in deep shit.

296
00:18:28,342 --> 00:18:30,845
Yeah, it's exactly
why I wanna do it.

297
00:18:30,878 --> 00:18:33,581
And besides, we all have
to live a little, right?

298
00:18:35,049 --> 00:18:35,883
Touche.

299
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:46,694
Mabry.

300
00:18:46,728 --> 00:18:48,963
Why do you always have your
nose in that witchy book?

301
00:18:50,732 --> 00:18:52,265
It doesn't hurt to be prepared.

302
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,868
Prepared for what?

303
00:18:53,901 --> 00:18:54,736
What are we fighting now?

304
00:18:54,769 --> 00:18:57,038
Werewolves? Vampires?

305
00:18:57,071 --> 00:18:58,640
Wee little leprechauns?

306
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,375
Have you forgotten
what tonight is?

307
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:03,511
No, I haven't forgotten.

308
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,014
This is how I deal
with things, Mabry,

309
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,315
with my unbridled charm and wit.

310
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,319
- And wit.
- And wit.

311
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:14,421
Wit, Maybry, wit.

312
00:19:14,454 --> 00:19:17,759
I'm gonna go back in
the back and repackage

313
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:18,860
some shrunken heads.

314
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,129
- You do that, please.
- Get drunk.

315
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:22,496
You're just upset that I
got the looks in the family.

316
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,631
That's all.

317
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:25,033
Yeah, crushed over it.

318
00:19:45,586 --> 00:19:47,055
You seriously didn't
have to do this.

319
00:19:47,088 --> 00:19:48,488
It's probably one
of these stupidest-

320
00:19:48,523 --> 00:19:50,124
No. I wanted to.

321
00:19:51,592 --> 00:19:53,628
Plus it gives me a chance
to apologize for earlier.

322
00:19:59,901 --> 00:20:00,902
So why are you?

323
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,471
What?

324
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:05,405
You know.

325
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,777
I'm just curious what you
see in a guy like Billy.

326
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:14,182
I mean, it's not like
we're engaged or anything.

327
00:20:15,315 --> 00:20:17,919
I'm technically not
even dating officially.

328
00:20:19,286 --> 00:20:22,657
I mean, Billy's a jerk,
but he can be sweet.

329
00:20:23,925 --> 00:20:25,358
Billy Masterson's sweet?

330
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,228
Yeah. It sounds crazy.

331
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,898
But I mean, it's true.

332
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:36,571
I mean,

333
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:41,209
no one else has really
shown any interest.

334
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:45,312
Right.

335
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:49,416
I, I don't think we should be

336
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,952
doing this, Stokes.

337
00:20:50,985 --> 00:20:54,622
Dude, put your big boy pants
on and take off your diaper.

338
00:21:01,963 --> 00:21:03,731
What is wrong with you?

339
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:04,732
Stop it!

340
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:07,400
- Sorry.
- Mmm!

341
00:21:09,804 --> 00:21:12,305
Oh my god, Miah! Are you okay?

342
00:21:12,339 --> 00:21:13,508
All right over there, Sanders?

343
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:15,810
Ah, gee, Mr. King,
we are so sorry.

344
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:18,746
I guess Miah here wasn't
paying attention to the signs.

345
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,882
Signs? There were signs?

346
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,228
Come on. Let's go.

347
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:36,764
It's all right.

348
00:21:36,798 --> 00:21:38,132
I'll go get you a
band aid or something.

349
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,934
No!

350
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:40,802
No.

351
00:21:46,741 --> 00:21:48,075
It's just a scratch!

352
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:48,910
Right, Miah?

353
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:51,746
Right, Miah?

354
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:54,215
Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

355
00:21:54,248 --> 00:21:56,383
So sorry for the
inconvenience, Mr. King.

356
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,632
Hell and yes, we pulled it off!

357
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,801
Are you sure you're okay?

358
00:22:13,835 --> 00:22:15,036
I mean, they were
about to get caught.

359
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:16,037
It's the only thing
I could think of.

360
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,072
No harm, no foul, right?

361
00:22:18,105 --> 00:22:20,608
All right, we helped
your little dweeb friends.

362
00:22:20,641 --> 00:22:22,810
Can we go now?
- Yeah, just a second.

363
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,648
I'm gonna call Jared.
Have him come get us, okay?

364
00:22:27,682 --> 00:22:28,816
Okay. Do that.

365
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,385
Cammy, are you kidding me?

366
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,988
I'm right behind you.

367
00:22:37,959 --> 00:22:40,294
Damn! Call me later.

368
00:22:40,328 --> 00:22:41,729
Piss off, Stokely.

369
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:45,333
So now that you have the board,

370
00:22:45,365 --> 00:22:47,602
what do you plan to do with it?

371
00:22:47,635 --> 00:22:50,037
Figure out what
it does, obviously.

372
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,773
Do you wanna come?

373
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,208
It would be wrong not
to include you since you

374
00:22:54,242 --> 00:22:55,943
kind of made this all possible.

375
00:22:55,977 --> 00:22:57,745
Yeah. Hell yeah, I wanna come.

376
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:00,413
I just gotta catch up to
Paris and calm her down,

377
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,317
but what time and where?

378
00:23:03,351 --> 00:23:04,785
The fork, 9:00pm.

379
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,621
It's right up the
street from our house.

380
00:23:06,654 --> 00:23:07,622
Cool.

381
00:23:07,655 --> 00:23:09,156
Yeah, I'll see you guys there.

382
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:12,526
Maybe we could hang at
your place afterwards?

383
00:23:13,493 --> 00:23:14,662
Okay. Sure.

384
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:18,132
Okay. Don't start
to party without me.

385
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,169
Dude, I sense an
ulterior motive here.

386
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:30,144
There. I restocked
the holy water.

387
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,444
I did not pee in it this time.

388
00:23:31,478 --> 00:23:32,980
I actually got it
from the church.

389
00:23:33,014 --> 00:23:34,215
They tried to make
me pay for it.

390
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,584
So I ran, broke
the glass. Sorry.

391
00:23:36,617 --> 00:23:38,085
Have you seen my book?

392
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,755
Yeah, like every day
for the past 30 years.

393
00:23:40,788 --> 00:23:41,656
Here's a better question.

394
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,291
Did you eat? Did you sleep?

395
00:23:43,324 --> 00:23:45,593
I'm serious, Parker.
It was just here.

396
00:23:45,626 --> 00:23:47,161
You're like this every year.

397
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,230
And you know what? Now
you're upsetting Pickles.

398
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:51,098
So, you're fine. I'm fine.

399
00:23:51,132 --> 00:23:52,733
Pickles is fine. We're all fine!

400
00:24:09,884 --> 00:24:10,785
Hey, we should get started, bro.

401
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:12,320
It's getting pretty late.

402
00:24:12,353 --> 00:24:13,521
It's not nine yet.
She still has time.

403
00:24:14,422 --> 00:24:15,256
Okay.

404
00:24:29,971 --> 00:24:30,871
Hey.

405
00:24:30,905 --> 00:24:31,973
Sorry that took me so long.

406
00:24:32,006 --> 00:24:34,308
This is really out here.

407
00:24:34,342 --> 00:24:36,344
Yeah, it is way out.

408
00:24:36,377 --> 00:24:37,578
Yeah, I didn't want
you to think I was

409
00:24:37,611 --> 00:24:38,679
like standing you
up or something.

410
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:42,482
No, no, no. It's totally fine.

411
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:46,320
Yeah. Glad you're here.

412
00:24:46,354 --> 00:24:50,891
Let's get started,
eh? Chop, chop.

413
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,130
Bah!

414
00:24:56,163 --> 00:24:59,133
Sorry, I was to
lighten the mood.

415
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:08,542
What's the hold up, numb nuts?

416
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:09,744
Will you shut up?

417
00:25:09,777 --> 00:25:11,779
I'm trying to make
sure I do this right.

418
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:14,915
Doesn't really come with
an instruction manual.

419
00:25:14,949 --> 00:25:16,650
I'm kind of making
it up as I go.

420
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,555
What if we all
put our hands on it?

421
00:25:21,589 --> 00:25:23,324
Like, like a ouija
board, you know?

422
00:25:25,126 --> 00:25:25,960
Worth a shot.

423
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:31,732
Oh, shit. It glows?

424
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:35,002
Do you guys feel that?

425
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:36,871
Wha, what's it doin', Stokes?

426
00:25:36,904 --> 00:25:38,406
How am I supposed know, man?

427
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:44,311
Oh, here are the words.

428
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:53,921
Wait!
Someone do something!

429
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:54,889
Miah! Miah!

430
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:57,291
Snap out of it!

431
00:25:58,392 --> 00:25:59,528
Miah!

432
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,594
Miah! Miah!

433
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:03,264
What's happening?

434
00:26:03,297 --> 00:26:04,533
Miah! Miah!

435
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:08,537
Miah!

436
00:26:18,879 --> 00:26:21,582
Oh, no, no. Is he
dead? Is he dead?

437
00:26:21,615 --> 00:26:23,484
I mean, it looks like it.

438
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:24,351
Miah?

439
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:26,787
Are you okay?

440
00:26:28,756 --> 00:26:29,590
Think so.

441
00:26:31,792 --> 00:26:32,760
What just happened?

442
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:43,838
You good, B?

443
00:26:43,871 --> 00:26:44,705
I'm good. You?

444
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:47,208
Yeah, I think I'm fine.

445
00:26:48,843 --> 00:26:50,044
You gotta be kiddin' me.

446
00:26:50,077 --> 00:26:51,812
Cool. The board
sends assholes.

447
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:53,681
Paris told me that
you've been super friendly

448
00:26:53,714 --> 00:26:55,816
to this little sack of shit!

449
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,918
I mean, it's almost
like you're fond of him.

450
00:26:57,952 --> 00:26:59,554
Had to find out for
myself and I come here

451
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:01,055
see you all cut up in
the woods playin' some

452
00:27:01,088 --> 00:27:02,223
fuckin' board game?

453
00:27:02,256 --> 00:27:03,424
- Billy, seriously.
- No, no, no.

454
00:27:03,457 --> 00:27:04,391
Stop!

455
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:05,259
Shh! No!

456
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,796
Don't say anything more
to me, you little slut.

457
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,771
Oh ho! Shit!

458
00:27:19,974 --> 00:27:21,475
Nice hit, little spitfire.

459
00:27:27,214 --> 00:27:31,185
Miah!

460
00:27:31,218 --> 00:27:32,786
I want you to know somethin'.

461
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:37,758
I really want you to
use your imagination

462
00:27:37,791 --> 00:27:39,393
when I tell you this.

463
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:40,261
Your hand?

464
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,697
It's most definitely
not the first thing

465
00:27:43,731 --> 00:27:45,065
that she's put her lips on.

466
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:47,536
Oh!

467
00:27:48,702 --> 00:27:50,337
Come on.

468
00:27:50,371 --> 00:27:51,372
Billy, you asshole!

469
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:52,607
Whatever, bitch.

470
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:55,743
Oh, shit.

471
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:02,883
Do you even know
how to use that thing?

472
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,586
Only one way to find out.

473
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:06,787
Of course he doesn't.

474
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,155
Now, piss off.

475
00:28:10,958 --> 00:28:13,562
Come on. Let's just go, babe.

476
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,199
You're dead, little boy.

477
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,743
You got brass balls, kid.

478
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,145
Bigger than your brother's.

479
00:28:40,254 --> 00:28:41,088
Benny.

480
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:43,558
Benny, give me the gun.

481
00:28:43,592 --> 00:28:45,025
- Ben.
- Benny!

482
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,002
It's all right. Let's go.

483
00:29:02,042 --> 00:29:04,378
What the hell are
those pussies doing, huh?

484
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,615
Fuckin' some ghost or something?

485
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:08,115
I just can't believe Cammy.

486
00:29:08,148 --> 00:29:10,751
I mean, do you think she's
at his house right now?

487
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,922
Nobody screws me like that
and lives to talk about it.

488
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,727
Just forget 'em, all right?

489
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,961
She chose them and not us.

490
00:29:20,995 --> 00:29:22,396
I wonder what Steve's
doing right now.

491
00:29:22,429 --> 00:29:24,064
He's probably in the
fucking car masturbating

492
00:29:24,098 --> 00:29:24,932
his little dick.

493
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,636
Hey, we're about to go up there.

494
00:29:27,669 --> 00:29:30,838
We're gonna teach these
little pansies a lesson.

495
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,776
What's this twinker doin'?

496
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:37,545
I don't know.
What is she doin'?

497
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,847
She's standin' there.

498
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:42,783
Hey, asshole!

499
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,852
I don't have time for this shit!

500
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:46,353
Billy, over here.

501
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:50,592
What the fuck is this?

502
00:30:01,302 --> 00:30:02,136
Oh, no.

503
00:30:45,112 --> 00:30:46,080
Slow, slow.

504
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:53,722
Should we call Mom?

505
00:30:54,888 --> 00:30:56,890
No, Benny, we
shouldn't call Mom.

506
00:30:56,924 --> 00:30:58,693
Use your fucking head.

507
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:00,260
I'm sorry.

508
00:31:00,294 --> 00:31:03,397
Another stupid idea on a
day full of stupid ideas.

509
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,599
I-

510
00:31:04,632 --> 00:31:05,399
I mean, what were you thinking?

511
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:07,635
A gun? Seriously?

512
00:31:07,669 --> 00:31:09,169
Where did you find it?

513
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,606
Mom keeps her guns in the
barn so I won't find them.

514
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:12,841
Yeah, stupid.

515
00:31:12,873 --> 00:31:14,007
Well, I'm sorry
for saving your ass!

516
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:15,543
You could've killed someone!

517
00:31:23,518 --> 00:31:25,486
Oh, hey, at least we
still got the board.

518
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,154
Enough with the board, Stokely!

519
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,656
- Just calm down.
- Miah.

520
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,025
No, stop. Just let me.

521
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:41,736
Miah.

522
00:32:28,048 --> 00:32:28,883
Miah.

523
00:32:31,653 --> 00:32:34,087
I'm so sick of that asshole.

524
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:36,990
Why won't he just
leave us alone?

525
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,693
It's my fault. None of
this would've happened-

526
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:40,360
No. No, it's not.

527
00:32:40,394 --> 00:32:42,262
He shouldn't have said any
of that shit about you.

528
00:32:47,234 --> 00:32:48,068
How bad is it?

529
00:32:49,537 --> 00:32:50,337
I'm fine.

530
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:52,439
Let me see.

531
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,583
Oh, he really did
a number on you.

532
00:33:07,287 --> 00:33:08,723
I feel awful.

533
00:33:08,756 --> 00:33:10,792
I guess I just wanted
to see you again.

534
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:37,284
Here's Stokely!

535
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:40,855
Seriously?

536
00:33:40,889 --> 00:33:41,923
Fine. I had to.

537
00:33:44,893 --> 00:33:46,059
How you doin'?

538
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:49,496
I'm fine.

539
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:50,899
Miah may have thought
you made a mistake,

540
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:53,433
but, uh, I think you're
just a regular bad ass.

541
00:33:54,836 --> 00:33:56,004
Yeah, right.

542
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:56,971
No, seriously.

543
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:59,139
Balls of steel, little bro.

544
00:33:59,172 --> 00:34:01,441
And here I thought they
hadn't even dropped yet.

545
00:34:01,475 --> 00:34:02,677
Shut up.

546
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,045
Hey, want some
Nancy Summer shit?

547
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,448
You gonna make me cover my eyes?

548
00:34:08,482 --> 00:34:10,885
Nah, I think you
deserve somethin'.

549
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:11,753
Come on.

550
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:18,560
So, uh, board thing
was kinda cool, right?

551
00:34:19,861 --> 00:34:20,695
Yeah.

552
00:34:32,574 --> 00:34:33,908
All right, got the chains.

553
00:34:33,942 --> 00:34:35,309
I'm gonna pick up some grub.

554
00:34:35,342 --> 00:34:36,176
What do ya want?

555
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:39,212
Why don't you swing by Brady's

556
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,515
and get us some Jungle Juice?

557
00:34:40,548 --> 00:34:41,749
I like where your head is at.

558
00:34:41,783 --> 00:34:43,651
Nothin' I like more on
this holiday than I hate

559
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:48,388
other than to be drunk.

560
00:35:12,547 --> 00:35:13,347
Oh!

561
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:25,693
You picked the wrong
fight, Pinocchio!

562
00:35:47,115 --> 00:35:49,651
You all right there, buddy?

563
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,737
I'm drunk.

564
00:36:09,771 --> 00:36:11,005
Yeah, you are.

565
00:36:18,146 --> 00:36:19,547
No better place than here.

566
00:36:21,082 --> 00:36:23,383
On this dirty side of the road?

567
00:36:23,417 --> 00:36:25,119
You love it when I play dirty.

568
00:36:26,754 --> 00:36:28,723
I don't know. It's creepy.

569
00:36:28,756 --> 00:36:30,457
And it's Halloween.

570
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:31,959
Come on, babe.

571
00:36:31,993 --> 00:36:34,796
I wanna stab you
with my pitchfork.

572
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:37,330
Come on.

573
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:15,703
What did you break?

574
00:37:26,147 --> 00:37:27,247
Oh, shit.

575
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:30,250
The board.

576
00:37:41,062 --> 00:37:41,896
Dammit!

577
00:38:10,057 --> 00:38:11,993
You are so beautiful.

578
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:54,869
Sorry, sorry.

579
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,237
It's really late.

580
00:38:56,270 --> 00:39:00,208
Yeah, I really
hope it's not my mom.

581
00:39:12,253 --> 00:39:14,055
Shit!

582
00:39:14,088 --> 00:39:16,057
Oh my god.

583
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,357
Whoa.

584
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,060
What the hell?

585
00:39:19,093 --> 00:39:20,061
No fucking clue.

586
00:39:30,938 --> 00:39:33,241
Look, look. Yeah!

587
00:39:50,758 --> 00:39:51,592
Thanks.

588
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:58,398
So, what do you wanna do?

589
00:40:00,835 --> 00:40:02,435
Haven't shown you my room yet.

590
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,306
No, you haven't.

591
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:07,174
I got a pretty big bed.

592
00:40:08,142 --> 00:40:09,744
Well, that's good, I suppose.

593
00:40:18,886 --> 00:40:21,421
What the hell is that?

594
00:40:21,454 --> 00:40:22,290
Miah.

595
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:33,668
Hello?

596
00:40:36,537 --> 00:40:37,338
Hello?

597
00:40:40,041 --> 00:40:42,376
All right, whoever's out
here, could you please not be?

598
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,244
That'd be great.

599
00:40:51,252 --> 00:40:52,485
I'm callin' the cops!

600
00:40:57,191 --> 00:40:57,992
Guys, what's goin' on?

601
00:40:58,025 --> 00:40:59,492
Jesus.

602
00:40:59,527 --> 00:41:01,796
Billy and his goons are back.

603
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:02,663
Great.

604
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:08,803
Is anyone else's phone
connected to the WiFi?

605
00:41:10,705 --> 00:41:11,973
Mine says disconnected.

606
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:12,807
Mine, too.

607
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,444
There's no service this
far out without WiFi.

608
00:41:20,848 --> 00:41:22,717
Jesus, I'm so
fucking sick of that.

609
00:41:41,902 --> 00:41:44,405
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

610
00:42:02,289 --> 00:42:05,326
Billy? I'll handle this.

611
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,328
I don't think
that's a good idea.

612
00:42:07,361 --> 00:42:09,096
I'm not afraid of them.

613
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,765
All right, fine.
I'll go with you.

614
00:42:10,798 --> 00:42:13,100
No, you're in
absolutely no shape to.

615
00:42:13,134 --> 00:42:14,402
Just stay here
with your brothers.

616
00:42:14,435 --> 00:42:15,336
No, I'm fine!

617
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,004
Miah, I'm serious.

618
00:42:17,038 --> 00:42:17,938
What if they hurt you?

619
00:42:17,972 --> 00:42:19,273
He's not gonna hurt me.

620
00:42:19,306 --> 00:42:20,141
Wait.

621
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,745
It's dangerous to
go alone. Take this.

622
00:42:27,014 --> 00:42:29,216
Don't worry. I got this.

623
00:42:34,388 --> 00:42:37,792
Seriously, guys?

624
00:42:37,825 --> 00:42:39,126
All right, Billy.

625
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,361
You've had your fun.

626
00:42:40,394 --> 00:42:42,063
Now grow the hell
up and go home.

627
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:46,901
Hey, hey.

628
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,102
Did you seal the deal?

629
00:42:49,236 --> 00:42:50,505
What do you mean, Stokely?

630
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:53,542
Did you seal the deal?

631
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,777
No, we just made out.

632
00:42:56,811 --> 00:42:59,346
Do you feel like you
would've sealed the deal-

633
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,881
All right, will
you shut up, please?

634
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:02,416
I'm just saying.

635
00:43:05,186 --> 00:43:06,087
I mean, seriously!

636
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:07,822
I don't know what your issue is.

637
00:43:07,855 --> 00:43:09,423
You beat up Miah.

638
00:43:09,457 --> 00:43:12,593
You go get these costumes
and come back here?

639
00:43:12,626 --> 00:43:13,461
For what?

640
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:18,466
And Paris.

641
00:43:18,499 --> 00:43:20,301
I guess I expected
more of you having been

642
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:23,104
my friend forever, but I
guess you're just as bad

643
00:43:23,137 --> 00:43:24,605
as these two lowlifes.

644
00:43:26,407 --> 00:43:29,110
I wonder what
she's saying to them.

645
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:30,611
Who knows?

646
00:43:30,644 --> 00:43:32,646
That was super hot though
how she stormed outside

647
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,115
with the bat.

648
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:36,183
I'm getting serious Sarah
Connor vibes from her.

649
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:38,587
Who's Sarah Connor?

650
00:43:39,453 --> 00:43:40,354
Dude!

651
00:43:40,387 --> 00:43:41,856
I mean, come on, you guys.

652
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:43,891
You can cut the shit and
take the stupid masks off.

653
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:54,935
No, dear.

654
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:59,608
It's anything but pointless.

655
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,109
You have something of mine.

656
00:44:03,677 --> 00:44:05,346
I'm here to collect.

657
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:10,317
You're not...

658
00:44:13,888 --> 00:44:14,722
Paris?

659
00:44:16,423 --> 00:44:17,258
Oh.

660
00:44:18,692 --> 00:44:21,195
Oh, I see you two
know each other.

661
00:44:26,967 --> 00:44:27,768
Cammy.

662
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:29,336
Shit!

663
00:44:39,246 --> 00:44:40,515
Help! Help me!

664
00:44:40,549 --> 00:44:41,782
Please! Please!

665
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,985
God, I'm bleeding!

666
00:44:45,019 --> 00:44:46,854
What did I do to him!

667
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:48,756
Please! No! Please!

668
00:44:48,789 --> 00:44:50,724
I can't! What the fuck?

669
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:56,063
Hey, Cammy, Cammy, Cammy.

670
00:45:10,411 --> 00:45:11,412
So tragic.

671
00:45:14,081 --> 00:45:15,416
Miah! Miah!

672
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:16,685
Come on, we gotta go.

673
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:17,552
Let's go!

674
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:25,859
Gentlemen!

675
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,698
You summoned us.

676
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:32,701
Here we are.

677
00:45:34,802 --> 00:45:36,504
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy fucking shit!

678
00:45:36,538 --> 00:45:38,839
We're so fucking dead!

679
00:45:38,872 --> 00:45:41,141
I don't see them!

680
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:45,246
Shit.
Where'd they go?

681
00:45:46,681 --> 00:45:47,649
C-Cammy?

682
00:45:47,682 --> 00:45:48,583
Miah.

683
00:45:48,617 --> 00:45:49,517
Miah, what are we gonna do?

684
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:51,452
He's cracked, Stokes.

685
00:45:51,485 --> 00:45:53,387
Miah, did you lock the back
door when you came back in?

686
00:45:54,255 --> 00:45:55,089
Shit!

687
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:02,229
Fuck.

688
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:07,434
Not cool!

689
00:46:07,468 --> 00:46:08,836
No! Stop it!

690
00:46:16,678 --> 00:46:17,579
This isn't happening.

691
00:46:17,612 --> 00:46:19,681
This isn't fucking happening.

692
00:46:19,714 --> 00:46:21,448
They killed her.

693
00:46:21,482 --> 00:46:22,751
Was it Billy?

694
00:46:24,985 --> 00:46:26,588
Dammit, Miah, was it Billy?

695
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:28,455
No, no, no.

696
00:46:28,489 --> 00:46:33,494
Billy, Billy was dead.

697
00:46:34,995 --> 00:46:35,829
What?

698
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:29,450
So this isn't Billy
and his goons?

699
00:47:29,483 --> 00:47:31,051
No.

700
00:47:31,085 --> 00:47:31,919
It's the board.

701
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:34,622
Enough with the board.

702
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:36,290
No, he's right.

703
00:47:36,323 --> 00:47:38,258
I can't explain it, but
something happened tonight,

704
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:39,493
Miah, and you know it.

705
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:40,762
Can we please focus
on getting out of here?

706
00:47:40,795 --> 00:47:42,896
How are we supposed
to do that, Einstein?

707
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:47,234
What about our bikes?

708
00:47:50,037 --> 00:47:51,773
We'll never make
it on our bikes.

709
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:54,975
But Cammy drove here.

710
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:56,076
Her car's parked out back.

711
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,177
If we can make it to her car,

712
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:59,179
we can get the hell out of here.

713
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:00,280
What about her keys?

714
00:48:03,884 --> 00:48:06,220
Do we just leave her body?

715
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:07,488
You're gonna pack
the car, Benny?

716
00:48:07,522 --> 00:48:08,322
'Cause I'm not.

717
00:48:08,355 --> 00:48:09,189
We can't.

718
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,562
Our only problem is
gonna be making sure

719
00:48:14,596 --> 00:48:16,765
we get out of here
without running into them.

720
00:48:16,798 --> 00:48:18,533
I only saw three.

721
00:48:18,566 --> 00:48:20,334
Could there be more?

722
00:48:20,367 --> 00:48:21,935
You're forgetting about
the one not in the mask.

723
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,370
So, four.

724
00:48:23,404 --> 00:48:26,106
But how do we know there's
not more out there?

725
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:28,442
And who's the
creepy Elvira chick?

726
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:31,145
No idea, but we can't
stay and find out. Come on.

727
00:48:32,012 --> 00:48:34,214
We're so screwed.

728
00:49:21,529 --> 00:49:22,362
Shut up.

729
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:22,884
Come on, come on.

730
00:51:29,222 --> 00:51:30,525
Pull the trigger, Miah.

731
00:51:31,693 --> 00:51:33,595
Now would be a good
time to kill that.

732
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,230
Like now.

733
00:51:38,733 --> 00:51:40,535
Should've done it
like 10 seconds ago,

734
00:51:40,568 --> 00:51:42,269
but you've still
got redemption time.

735
00:51:42,302 --> 00:51:44,906
Stop it for one
second in your life.

736
00:51:44,939 --> 00:51:46,574
Shut up.
- Shoot it.

737
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,313
Okay, we're out of the barn.

738
00:51:58,987 --> 00:52:01,689
No!

739
00:52:04,692 --> 00:52:05,526
You do it.

740
00:52:10,531 --> 00:52:12,767
Back off, slip knot.

741
00:52:15,703 --> 00:52:17,071
Should've stayed down, clown.

742
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:25,379
You, you have no idea
what you've done!

743
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:28,315
Get your asses up and
back in that house now

744
00:52:28,348 --> 00:52:30,417
before another one of
those things shows up.

745
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:32,954
Come on!

746
00:52:36,256 --> 00:52:37,558
Nice shot.

747
00:52:37,592 --> 00:52:39,292
I am to please.

748
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:41,495
Can we quit clownin' around now?

749
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:44,632
Clownin', right,
'cause it's a clown.

750
00:52:59,647 --> 00:53:01,516
We got a ghoulie at 12 o'clock.

751
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:03,216
Like my 12 or your 12?

752
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:05,185
'Cause this is my
12. That's your 12.

753
00:53:05,218 --> 00:53:06,587
Who cares? He's right there.

754
00:53:06,621 --> 00:53:08,388
Yeah, okay.

755
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:09,256
You know what? You get that one.

756
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,223
I'll get the next one.

757
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:11,391
I'm gonna get the next one.

758
00:53:13,393 --> 00:53:14,729
It's like last time, right?

759
00:53:14,762 --> 00:53:16,363
Yeah, I was, I was seven.

760
00:53:17,632 --> 00:53:19,634
Yeah, unfortunately,
like the last time.

761
00:53:21,135 --> 00:53:23,838
- Okay, move, move.
- Get set.

762
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:24,972
Move, move!

763
00:53:46,127 --> 00:53:47,461
Look, Mabry, I can explain.

764
00:53:47,494 --> 00:53:48,830
I don't want any of this-

765
00:53:48,863 --> 00:53:49,664
What the hell?

766
00:53:49,697 --> 00:53:51,065
Sit down, good hair.

767
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:53,534
You three have
royally screwed up.

768
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,604
You don't know what you're
dealing with out there.

769
00:53:56,637 --> 00:53:58,438
Okay, what are we dealing with?

770
00:53:58,472 --> 00:54:01,175
There's a reason that
this board wasn't for sale!

771
00:54:02,442 --> 00:54:03,276
The board?

772
00:54:04,444 --> 00:54:06,848
Yes, the board.
It works like a key.

773
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:09,050
A gateway to the
other dimensions.

774
00:54:09,083 --> 00:54:12,553
Those things out
there, you summoned.

775
00:54:12,587 --> 00:54:15,523
Wait. Things?

776
00:54:15,556 --> 00:54:16,758
I mean, not like humans.

777
00:54:16,791 --> 00:54:19,761
More like demons
or tortured souls

778
00:54:19,794 --> 00:54:21,028
connected to the board.

779
00:54:21,062 --> 00:54:22,563
He calls 'em ghoulies.

780
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:24,331
Like the movie?

781
00:54:25,833 --> 00:54:27,267
Yes?

782
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:28,936
Well, what about the creepy,
semi-attractive lady killer

783
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:29,837
with the rack?

784
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:32,405
Samael.

785
00:54:34,474 --> 00:54:35,843
A dark necromancer.

786
00:54:36,878 --> 00:54:38,679
She feeds on innocence.

787
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:40,148
Oh.

788
00:54:40,181 --> 00:54:42,750
How exactly do the off-brand
Winchesters know all this?

789
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,187
Because when we
were young and stupid,

790
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:48,156
we used the board.

791
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:50,457
And those things came for us,

792
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,027
and they took our friends
and they almost got us, too,

793
00:54:53,060 --> 00:54:54,327
but I managed to close the gate.

794
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:57,999
But it screwed us up for life.

795
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:02,236
Especially Parker.

796
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,403
That much is obvious.

797
00:55:03,436 --> 00:55:05,506
Oh, you're a little
twat, aren't ya?

798
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:06,841
Eh.

799
00:55:06,874 --> 00:55:07,775
I'm gonna shoot 'em.

800
00:55:07,809 --> 00:55:09,210
I'm gonna, right in the foot.

801
00:55:09,243 --> 00:55:11,378
What I was able to
learn, and it's not much,

802
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:14,682
is they can only be
summoned on Halloween.

803
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:19,120
And they use that to hide
what they really are.

804
00:55:19,153 --> 00:55:19,987
For what?

805
00:55:21,889 --> 00:55:24,424
Do you listen to
nothing that I say?

806
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,295
Halloween. It's the
one time of year

807
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:29,997
that the veil between the
dimensions is the thinnest.

808
00:55:30,031 --> 00:55:32,967
You screw with the darkness
and it tends to screw back,

809
00:55:34,268 --> 00:55:35,435
without a happy ending.

810
00:55:38,405 --> 00:55:39,240
Now.

811
00:55:40,608 --> 00:55:43,544
One of those things attacked
me at my shop earlier,

812
00:55:43,578 --> 00:55:46,714
so we don't know how many
of those are out there.

813
00:55:46,747 --> 00:55:47,982
But as long as the gate is open,

814
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:49,050
they're gonna keep
coming through.

815
00:55:49,083 --> 00:55:50,383
It's gonna keep getting worse.

816
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,619
So how do we close it?

817
00:55:51,652 --> 00:55:53,688
It's more like how
do you three close it,

818
00:55:53,721 --> 00:55:56,423
or whichever one of you
recited the incantation.

819
00:56:41,135 --> 00:56:43,504
I don't like the sound of that.

820
00:56:43,537 --> 00:56:45,606
Here's the thing about fear.

821
00:56:46,574 --> 00:56:47,642
It seasons the meat.

822
00:56:50,443 --> 00:56:53,714
From all the way out
here I can smell it

823
00:56:53,748 --> 00:56:55,983
pulsing through your veins,

824
00:56:56,017 --> 00:56:59,186
and I can't wait to feast

825
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:02,556
on your putrid, innocent flesh.

826
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,560
Especially you!

827
00:57:06,594 --> 00:57:10,064
♪ Benny boy, Benny boy ♪

828
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:11,732
How does she know my name?

829
00:57:13,334 --> 00:57:15,970
Jeremiah!

830
00:57:17,171 --> 00:57:20,942
What say you and I
make a deal, a bargain.

831
00:57:20,975 --> 00:57:23,077
Quid pro quo, tit for tat.

832
00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:26,247
You give me your brother

833
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:30,051
and I'll let you live.

834
00:57:35,856 --> 00:57:36,691
Humans.

835
00:57:38,693 --> 00:57:41,963
They always do
everything the hard way.

836
00:57:43,364 --> 00:57:45,132
My friends, the stage is yours.

837
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:50,538
Oh, no, no, no.
This is not good.

838
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:52,039
What are we gonna do?

839
00:57:52,073 --> 00:57:52,940
We gotta go.

840
00:57:52,974 --> 00:57:53,975
Basement.

841
00:57:54,008 --> 00:57:55,576
Get your asses downstairs now!

842
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:59,347
Goodbye!

843
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:03,117
I'm out of here!

844
00:58:15,196 --> 00:58:17,131
Gotta get out of here.

845
00:58:17,164 --> 00:58:18,099
Is there a way out?

846
00:58:19,066 --> 00:58:20,034
Hey, snap out of it.

847
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:21,635
Is there a way out of here?

848
00:58:21,669 --> 00:58:23,471
Yeah, go this way. Come on.

849
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:24,672
Go.

850
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:37,251
Get the next one.

851
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:46,227
Oh now! What and
call me a biscuit.

852
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,063
If it isn't the
little King boys.

853
00:58:49,096 --> 00:58:51,032
You're grown up, I see.

854
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,934
Hi, boys.

855
00:58:53,968 --> 00:58:54,802
Samael.

856
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,705
You haven't changed at all.

857
00:59:00,007 --> 00:59:02,076
Still a soul-suckin',
Hot Topic, Stevie Nicks

858
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:03,512
out of hell's trailer park.

859
00:59:04,545 --> 00:59:05,613
Would love to stay and catch up,

860
00:59:05,646 --> 00:59:07,481
but we've got shit to do, so.

861
00:59:12,653 --> 00:59:15,056
Get in. And you watch my seats!

862
00:59:18,793 --> 00:59:20,694
Go, go, go, go, go!

863
00:59:20,728 --> 00:59:23,030
Old friends,
all those years ago.

864
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,800
Hey, why does this always
happen in this situation?

865
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,068
Always?

866
00:59:27,101 --> 00:59:28,469
She's been through
a lot, smart mouth.

867
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:30,137
Give her a break.

868
00:59:30,171 --> 00:59:33,107
Dude, those things are
gonna give us a break, okay?

869
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:36,577
Hey, let's go. We need
to leave, dude, now.

870
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:37,678
Okay, baby, just now start.

871
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:38,946
Now is a great time.

872
00:59:38,979 --> 00:59:41,015
Start the car, start the car.

873
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:42,551
Yeah, hey, we need to go.

874
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:43,751
Whoa! Oh!

875
00:59:43,784 --> 00:59:45,419
- Mabry.
- I'm trying!

876
00:59:45,453 --> 00:59:47,254
Shit! Come on!

877
00:59:47,288 --> 00:59:48,823
He's right there.

878
00:59:48,856 --> 00:59:50,191
Come on, come on! Dammit!

879
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:53,394
Hit the gas and run her over!

880
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:54,261
Now!

881
00:59:55,162 --> 00:59:56,630
We'll stall 'em.

882
00:59:56,664 --> 00:59:59,300
Tell me you're not
thinkin' what I'm thinkin'.

883
01:00:04,238 --> 01:00:05,306
Go, go, go!

884
01:00:07,608 --> 01:00:08,510
Run. Run!

885
01:00:11,645 --> 01:00:14,648
All right, one of you
maggots do something to my car.

886
01:00:17,651 --> 01:00:19,386
This is gonna be so much fun.

887
01:00:20,654 --> 01:00:21,556
Not as much fun
as sending you back

888
01:00:21,590 --> 01:00:22,356
into your little hellhole.

889
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:24,458
Mabry, Mabry, Mabry.

890
01:00:24,492 --> 01:00:27,529
You have always had a such
a limited imagination.

891
01:00:27,562 --> 01:00:29,163
How?

892
01:00:29,196 --> 01:00:30,397
It's a kiddie pool.

893
01:00:30,431 --> 01:00:33,167
It's a baby step to
where we're from.

894
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:35,970
Now, I congratulate you. I do.

895
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:38,139
All those years ago, you won.

896
01:00:38,172 --> 01:00:39,039
You shut the door.

897
01:00:40,074 --> 01:00:41,208
Yeah, I did.

898
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:45,212
That's not happening tonight.

899
01:00:46,814 --> 01:00:48,682
I will have those kids.

900
01:00:51,886 --> 01:00:54,655
I'm so sorry you won't
be alive to see it.

901
01:00:56,891 --> 01:00:57,858
Maybe not.

902
01:01:02,396 --> 01:01:05,733
But.

903
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:24,653
Follow the idiots.

904
01:01:38,299 --> 01:01:39,534
Julian Jitters.

905
01:01:51,845 --> 01:01:53,948
The kids have opened the
book, but they got away.

906
01:01:56,483 --> 01:01:58,852
Every moment they
live we are at risk.

907
01:02:03,724 --> 01:02:05,426
Don't let history repeat itself.

908
01:02:28,015 --> 01:02:30,417
Okay, so now that the
dude came to save us,

909
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:31,653
he's probably worm food.

910
01:02:31,686 --> 01:02:33,854
We need to find some help.

911
01:02:33,887 --> 01:02:35,189
What about Mom?

912
01:02:35,222 --> 01:02:36,658
Hey, this is Ellie Sanders.

913
01:02:36,691 --> 01:02:38,158
I'm sorry I'm over the
Atlantic right now.

914
01:02:38,192 --> 01:02:38,959
I can't take your call-

915
01:02:38,993 --> 01:02:40,662
The sheriff's station.

916
01:02:40,695 --> 01:02:43,197
It's about 15-20 minutes
that way, if we're lucky.

917
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:46,534
Guys.

918
01:03:17,097 --> 01:03:18,832
All right.

919
01:03:18,866 --> 01:03:20,669
I don't want to be a
negative Nancy or anything,

920
01:03:20,702 --> 01:03:22,637
but we kind of suck
at rescue missions.

921
01:03:22,671 --> 01:03:23,971
We kick ass at rescue missions.

922
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:24,872
We suck at babysitting.

923
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:26,675
Fine. Game plan?

924
01:03:26,708 --> 01:03:28,442
We find the Three
Stooges and close the gate.

925
01:03:28,475 --> 01:03:29,511
Right now I need
something sweet.

926
01:03:29,544 --> 01:03:30,512
My sugar's crashin'.

927
01:03:30,545 --> 01:03:31,513
Excellent. I am parched.

928
01:03:31,546 --> 01:03:32,413
Please go inside.

929
01:03:34,582 --> 01:03:36,250
Exactly, exactly what happened.

930
01:03:38,385 --> 01:03:39,820
Trick or treat, boys.

931
01:03:39,853 --> 01:03:40,888
Can we help you?

932
01:03:40,921 --> 01:03:43,023
I need 20 in gas and, um.

933
01:03:43,057 --> 01:03:44,291
Hello, everyone.

934
01:03:44,325 --> 01:03:46,493
This is Channel 7 news,
where the news matters.

935
01:03:46,528 --> 01:03:48,329
You feel all right, fellas?

936
01:03:49,531 --> 01:03:53,200
You're lookin' a little
green around the gills.

937
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:55,836
You guys seen three
teenagers come in here?

938
01:03:57,237 --> 01:03:59,907
Lanky, long-haired
chick-lookin' dudes.

939
01:03:59,940 --> 01:04:00,709
Real mouthy.

940
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:04,813
Besides, the teenagers
hang here all night.

941
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:05,680
Amateur night.

942
01:04:07,114 --> 01:04:09,651
It's good to see the kids
enjoying this time of year.

943
01:04:11,852 --> 01:04:15,657
You know, things
were a little sketchy

944
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:19,259
there for awhile with
that trunk or treating.

945
01:04:19,293 --> 01:04:21,830
Kids walking around the
gym pickin' out candy

946
01:04:22,731 --> 01:04:24,465
instead of trick or treating.

947
01:04:24,498 --> 01:04:25,499
Stupid shit.

948
01:04:26,568 --> 01:04:27,736
Stupid shit.

949
01:04:27,769 --> 01:04:31,004
Breaks my heart
driving down the street.

950
01:04:31,038 --> 01:04:32,373
No children out.

951
01:04:33,508 --> 01:04:35,376
Bunch of fuckin'
uptight assholes

952
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:38,345
sayin' it's not safe for
the kids to be out anymore.

953
01:04:38,379 --> 01:04:39,213
She's definitely got a point.

954
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:40,914
- Hey.
- Sorry.

955
01:04:40,948 --> 01:04:42,116
What?

956
01:04:42,149 --> 01:04:43,350
What, no, I'm just
saying every Halloween,

957
01:04:43,384 --> 01:04:45,018
trick or treat, monster
mash, all that stuff.

958
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:46,220
Can we go now, please?

959
01:04:47,689 --> 01:04:51,392
Hey, thought you
looked familiar.

960
01:04:51,425 --> 01:04:55,429
You own that oddity
shop in town, don't ya?

961
01:04:55,462 --> 01:04:57,064
Yeah, that's me.

962
01:04:57,097 --> 01:05:00,968
Got any of them back scratchers
made from alligator claws?

963
01:05:01,001 --> 01:05:02,369
Always wanted one of those.

964
01:05:05,038 --> 01:05:06,641
No.

965
01:05:06,674 --> 01:05:09,009
You two come with someone?

966
01:05:11,378 --> 01:05:13,280
You have a gun
back there, old man?

967
01:05:14,549 --> 01:05:15,382
Gun?

968
01:05:16,818 --> 01:05:18,051
What on earth for?

969
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:19,521
'Cause you're gonna need it.

970
01:05:21,321 --> 01:05:22,990
Need it for what?

971
01:05:23,023 --> 01:05:24,491
You'll see.

972
01:05:24,526 --> 01:05:25,359
Come on.

973
01:05:26,994 --> 01:05:28,295
Stay here, Janie.

974
01:05:28,328 --> 01:05:30,998
Let me go out an see what's.

975
01:05:31,031 --> 01:05:33,000
What are we doin'?

976
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:37,672
Oh, probably nothin', huh?

977
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:39,239
Stay sharp, all right?

978
01:05:39,273 --> 01:05:41,975
What in the hell
is goin' on here?

979
01:05:47,948 --> 01:05:48,783
Oh!

980
01:05:52,419 --> 01:05:54,589
You wanna? I'll go. Yup.

981
01:06:18,412 --> 01:06:19,246
Whah-ha!

982
01:06:20,515 --> 01:06:21,749
Okay.

983
01:06:21,783 --> 01:06:22,917
We're good? We're
good. That's good.

984
01:06:22,951 --> 01:06:27,020
You're fine? You okay?

985
01:06:27,054 --> 01:06:29,223
- Y'all find everything?
- Ah!

986
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:36,063
You shot Greg!

987
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:39,233
Shit.

988
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:42,035
Janie!

989
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:42,937
Sorry, Greg.

990
01:06:44,572 --> 01:06:45,840
What are you?

991
01:06:45,874 --> 01:06:47,909
What are you, fuckle head?

992
01:06:47,942 --> 01:06:49,711
Huh? What are you?

993
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:51,980
I've killed bigger rats
in Brooklyn than you.

994
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,717
I buried three husbands,
you think I'm afr...

995
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,384
Fuck you and your mother!

996
01:06:57,417 --> 01:06:58,252
Ah!

997
01:07:02,222 --> 01:07:03,625
Janie.

998
01:07:14,368 --> 01:07:15,202
Ah!

999
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:20,975
Ah!

1000
01:07:33,855 --> 01:07:34,856
I had him.

1001
01:07:41,963 --> 01:07:45,867
Dude, I gotta take
a break for a second.

1002
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:47,367
Call our mother or somethin'.

1003
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,169
My lungs feel like
I got Covid again.

1004
01:07:49,202 --> 01:07:51,973
We are so dead, so dead.

1005
01:07:52,006 --> 01:07:53,307
All right, let's take a break.

1006
01:07:55,475 --> 01:07:56,276
Try to get on the platform.

1007
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:58,746
If you see anyone, yell.

1008
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,383
Miah, you heard Mabry.

1009
01:08:03,417 --> 01:08:05,385
You're the only one who
can close that gate.

1010
01:08:06,788 --> 01:08:08,556
Can't close the gate,
Stokely, without the board.

1011
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:09,824
Mabry had it in his bag and he-

1012
01:08:09,857 --> 01:08:11,391
Yeah, why didn't
you grab it, man?

1013
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:13,761
Seriously?

1014
01:08:13,795 --> 01:08:14,996
None of this shit would've
happened had you not

1015
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:16,363
stolen the board
in the first place.

1016
01:08:16,396 --> 01:08:17,865
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

1017
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:19,734
I'm not the one who went
all Hogwarts spell casting

1018
01:08:19,767 --> 01:08:21,836
and opened the
gate to hell world.

1019
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:23,905
You're such a fucking skeez!

1020
01:08:23,938 --> 01:08:25,006
Really, Miah?

1021
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:25,840
Oh, you're gonna get all...

1022
01:08:35,315 --> 01:08:37,552
Miah, hit it!

1023
01:09:18,392 --> 01:09:19,761
Shit. It's locked.

1024
01:09:19,794 --> 01:09:21,129
What are we gonna do?

1025
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:25,667
Let's go around
the back, come on.

1026
01:09:30,705 --> 01:09:31,773
Hey, officers, officers.

1027
01:09:31,806 --> 01:09:33,340
We need your help.

1028
01:09:33,373 --> 01:09:34,842
These, uh, these
things are after us.

1029
01:09:34,876 --> 01:09:36,343
All right, all right,
is this some sort of prank

1030
01:09:36,376 --> 01:09:37,745
or something, 'cause we've
had enough of that tonight.

1031
01:09:37,779 --> 01:09:38,980
No, no, this is
definitely not a prank.

1032
01:09:39,013 --> 01:09:40,581
People have been
killed, mutilated.

1033
01:09:40,615 --> 01:09:41,816
We really need your help.

1034
01:09:41,849 --> 01:09:42,750
All right, all right, all right.

1035
01:09:42,784 --> 01:09:44,451
Let's just calm down, okay?

1036
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:46,054
What do these guys look like?

1037
01:09:46,087 --> 01:09:47,487
They're not people.

1038
01:09:47,522 --> 01:09:50,490
They're wearing
masks. Costumes.

1039
01:09:50,525 --> 01:09:52,325
And so is everybody
else tonight.

1040
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:54,261
Like, we just can't
go around arresting

1041
01:09:54,294 --> 01:09:56,931
and talking to everybody
wearing a mask.

1042
01:09:56,964 --> 01:09:59,499
You know it's Halloween, right?

1043
01:09:59,534 --> 01:10:00,702
Okay, look.

1044
01:10:00,735 --> 01:10:02,202
Why don't you guys
just go on in.

1045
01:10:02,235 --> 01:10:03,503
We'll get a statement and
we'll get this written down.

1046
01:10:03,538 --> 01:10:05,006
A fucking statement?

1047
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:06,607
Yes.

1048
01:10:06,641 --> 01:10:07,842
Oh, shit. It's too late.

1049
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,110
Come on, come on, come on.

1050
01:10:09,143 --> 01:10:10,477
Calm down now.

1051
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:17,652
- Hey.
- Whoa-ho-ho.

1052
01:10:17,685 --> 01:10:19,120
We said stop right there.

1053
01:10:19,153 --> 01:10:20,353
All right?

1054
01:10:20,387 --> 01:10:22,090
I wouldn't, I swear to
God I wouldn't do that.

1055
01:10:31,866 --> 01:10:35,036
Come on, let's get some help.

1056
01:10:38,072 --> 01:10:39,907
Ah, why didn't I get an invite?

1057
01:10:52,887 --> 01:10:53,821
- Hey, hey.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1058
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:55,255
This just will not do.

1059
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:56,891
Everyone is supposed
to be in costume.

1060
01:10:56,924 --> 01:10:58,325
Wait, don't tell me.

1061
01:10:58,358 --> 01:11:00,027
Oh my god, Stefan
just walked in.

1062
01:11:00,061 --> 01:11:01,495
Is he looking? Is he looking?

1063
01:11:01,529 --> 01:11:03,263
Don't look! Don't
look! Is he looking?

1064
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:04,532
Is he looking?

1065
01:11:04,565 --> 01:11:05,600
'Cause he so wants
to get with this.

1066
01:11:05,633 --> 01:11:06,634
Oh my god, Stefan!

1067
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,202
It's Stefan. I gotta go.

1068
01:11:08,236 --> 01:11:10,204
TTFN. Ta ta for now.

1069
01:11:12,073 --> 01:11:13,775
What the hell was that?

1070
01:11:13,808 --> 01:11:14,642
No idea.

1071
01:11:16,878 --> 01:11:19,080
You look like a good time.

1072
01:11:19,113 --> 01:11:21,749
You smell like booze
and bad decisions.

1073
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:24,018
Maybe a tad.

1074
01:11:24,051 --> 01:11:25,086
So what do you say?

1075
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:26,988
You wanna unwrap that Clark Bar

1076
01:11:27,021 --> 01:11:28,890
and put it in my candy bowl?

1077
01:11:28,923 --> 01:11:29,724
Oh.

1078
01:11:29,757 --> 01:11:31,259
Nope. Can't say I do.

1079
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:35,462
I just threw up a little
in my mouth.

1080
01:12:38,893 --> 01:12:41,996
Best party ever.

1081
01:12:45,833 --> 01:12:47,301
Shit!

1082
01:12:47,335 --> 01:12:48,603
We're trapped.

1083
01:12:48,636 --> 01:12:50,705
Dammit! Can't catch a break!

1084
01:12:50,738 --> 01:12:52,039
Oh, before we
die, can I just say

1085
01:12:52,073 --> 01:12:53,241
I don't wanna die a virgin?

1086
01:12:53,274 --> 01:12:55,009
Chill out, Stokely.
No one's dying.

1087
01:12:55,042 --> 01:12:58,145
Benny, stick behind us.
- Okay.

1088
01:12:58,179 --> 01:13:01,015
For Narnia!

1089
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:03,918
Oh, shit!

1090
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:07,788
Miah!

1091
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:12,660
Batter up.

1092
01:13:14,729 --> 01:13:15,730
Holy shit!

1093
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:20,601
I give it a two out of four.

1094
01:13:20,635 --> 01:13:21,636
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

1095
01:13:21,669 --> 01:13:23,104
I cut his head clean off!

1096
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:24,338
I mean, the one-liner
needed a little bit of work.

1097
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:25,940
Like, welcome to
my world, bitch.

1098
01:13:25,973 --> 01:13:28,576
Like "Freddy Vs.
Jason." You know?

1099
01:13:30,077 --> 01:13:31,345
Miah!

1100
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:40,554
Stokely!

1101
01:14:11,385 --> 01:14:12,219
Oh.

1102
01:14:13,187 --> 01:14:14,021
Shh. Shh.

1103
01:14:16,157 --> 01:14:19,760
This one, uh, this
one looks tasty.

1104
01:14:25,566 --> 01:14:26,400
Benny.

1105
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:28,903
Take me.

1106
01:14:28,936 --> 01:14:29,770
Benny.

1107
01:14:31,839 --> 01:14:33,107
Happy Halloween.

1108
01:14:34,742 --> 01:14:37,011
No, no, no! Miah!

1109
01:14:37,044 --> 01:14:37,878
Please!

1110
01:15:40,474 --> 01:15:42,043
Miah. Miah! Miah!

1111
01:15:44,045 --> 01:15:45,279
Miah. Hey, hey!

1112
01:15:48,049 --> 01:15:49,383
Where's Benny?

1113
01:15:50,785 --> 01:15:53,354
They took him. They took him.

1114
01:15:56,457 --> 01:15:58,059
Let's go get him.

1115
01:16:22,716 --> 01:16:24,218
You two look like shit.

1116
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:26,687
Get in the car.

1117
01:16:44,338 --> 01:16:46,040
We thought you
were already dead.

1118
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:47,074
So did we.

1119
01:16:49,743 --> 01:16:51,145
I have to get to Benny.

1120
01:16:51,178 --> 01:16:52,613
And close the gate.

1121
01:16:53,515 --> 01:16:55,716
Okay, sure. But first Ben.

1122
01:16:55,749 --> 01:16:57,284
I hate to level it
with you, Sanders,

1123
01:16:57,318 --> 01:16:58,886
but you need to accept
the fact that your brother

1124
01:16:58,919 --> 01:17:00,387
is probably already gone.

1125
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:03,858
Don't say that.

1126
01:17:07,761 --> 01:17:08,929
Like there was
already a good chance

1127
01:17:08,963 --> 01:17:10,297
you were already dead, too.

1128
01:17:11,765 --> 01:17:13,501
- That's different.
- How?

1129
01:17:13,535 --> 01:17:15,002
Because I'm kind of
a badass, all right?

1130
01:17:15,035 --> 01:17:16,571
This whole monster
hunting thing?

1131
01:17:16,605 --> 01:17:19,206
It's sort of my jam, okay?

1132
01:17:19,240 --> 01:17:20,674
Now I hate to piss
in your Cheerios,

1133
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:23,277
but the truth is, there's
a very real chance

1134
01:17:23,310 --> 01:17:27,114
that your brother is gone,
just like our friends.

1135
01:17:28,082 --> 01:17:29,283
What are you saying?

1136
01:17:29,316 --> 01:17:31,152
I'm saying that there
is a chance that your-

1137
01:17:31,185 --> 01:17:31,986
Okay, well don't say it.

1138
01:17:32,019 --> 01:17:33,654
Stop fucking say that!

1139
01:17:33,687 --> 01:17:35,122
You wanna get
pushy with me, kid?

1140
01:17:35,156 --> 01:17:36,390
I am not in the
mood to take your-

1141
01:17:36,423 --> 01:17:37,258
Screw you, Mabry!

1142
01:17:37,291 --> 01:17:38,492
You listen to me, kid!

1143
01:17:38,527 --> 01:17:40,161
Whose fault is this, huh?

1144
01:17:40,194 --> 01:17:41,596
Who opened the gate?

1145
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:43,063
You! You did!

1146
01:17:43,097 --> 01:17:45,032
All right, I am out here
trying to save your skinny ass.

1147
01:17:45,065 --> 01:17:46,467
You've got spunk,
I'll give you that,

1148
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,603
but you're gonna need it
'cause those things out there,

1149
01:17:48,637 --> 01:17:50,171
they're gonna chew you
up and spit you out

1150
01:17:50,204 --> 01:17:51,606
if you're not prepared!

1151
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:56,645
Okay.

1152
01:17:57,378 --> 01:17:58,712
I'm sorry, kid.

1153
01:18:00,515 --> 01:18:01,448
I really am.

1154
01:18:03,817 --> 01:18:06,453
This is the price we pay
for messin' with that board.

1155
01:18:08,455 --> 01:18:09,890
You opened Pandora's box.

1156
01:18:09,924 --> 01:18:12,459
You thought you were just
gonna walk away free.

1157
01:18:12,493 --> 01:18:14,596
There's still time.

1158
01:18:17,364 --> 01:18:18,567
Wait.

1159
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,768
You and your brother
managed to escape, so.

1160
01:18:20,801 --> 01:18:22,069
Yeah. Barely.

1161
01:18:23,237 --> 01:18:24,673
We barely got out of the
pit before lady death

1162
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:27,808
pulled me down into the abyss,
but he closed the portal.

1163
01:18:27,841 --> 01:18:29,009
Yeah, but she didn't.

1164
01:18:29,877 --> 01:18:31,613
He saved you.

1165
01:18:31,646 --> 01:18:33,080
He did.

1166
01:18:33,113 --> 01:18:34,148
So that means
we can still save Ben.

1167
01:18:35,684 --> 01:18:36,817
Maybe, maybe not.

1168
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:39,853
Either way, that portal
has to be closed.

1169
01:18:39,887 --> 01:18:44,024
Mabry, we can still save him.

1170
01:18:44,058 --> 01:18:47,629
I made a promise to protect
my brothers, and I didn't.

1171
01:18:48,495 --> 01:18:49,964
I fucking failed.

1172
01:18:51,999 --> 01:18:55,135
I will help you end this,
but Benny is my top priority.

1173
01:18:55,169 --> 01:18:58,239
Please help me save him!

1174
01:19:08,650 --> 01:19:11,118
We don't have much time.

1175
01:19:11,151 --> 01:19:12,721
All right, we've killed
a lot of those things,

1176
01:19:12,753 --> 01:19:14,522
but as long as the gate's open.

1177
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,095
That's too much, princess.

1178
01:19:21,128 --> 01:19:21,962
Too much.

1179
01:19:22,930 --> 01:19:24,031
Thought it was cute.

1180
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:27,736
Well, can't go into
battle empty-handed.

1181
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:31,305
Great. All right.

1182
01:19:31,338 --> 01:19:33,774
So where did you happy
mills mess with the board?

1183
01:19:34,676 --> 01:19:35,644
Indian Fork Park.

1184
01:19:39,446 --> 01:19:40,281
Let's end this.

1185
01:19:42,216 --> 01:19:43,317
Hell, yeah!

1186
01:19:44,753 --> 01:19:46,120
I'm gonna shoot that one.

1187
01:20:12,614 --> 01:20:13,914
You look terrified.

1188
01:20:15,349 --> 01:20:16,984
You should be.

1189
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:19,119
What do you plan to do with me?

1190
01:20:19,153 --> 01:20:22,624
Oh, just drain
you of your essence,

1191
01:20:22,657 --> 01:20:24,759
indulge ourselves
on your innocence.

1192
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:27,027
Lady, in English.

1193
01:20:29,163 --> 01:20:30,431
We're going to eat you.

1194
01:20:31,733 --> 01:20:32,567
It's gonna hurt.

1195
01:20:37,304 --> 01:20:39,340
This night never would've
happened if you hadn't come.

1196
01:20:39,373 --> 01:20:40,575
Yo, Elvira!

1197
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:45,079
Fancy meeting you here, eh?

1198
01:20:45,112 --> 01:20:47,915
Did you really think you
can save your little brother?

1199
01:20:47,948 --> 01:20:51,885
You know, today has probably
been the worst Halloween

1200
01:20:51,919 --> 01:20:53,187
of my life.

1201
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:56,156
First, I make the grave
mistake of messing

1202
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:58,125
with that board,
which causes all this.

1203
01:20:59,059 --> 01:21:01,629
And now I had to kill them.

1204
01:21:01,663 --> 01:21:03,497
And now I smell like roadkill.

1205
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:06,500
And now I gotta kick
you in your lady parts,

1206
01:21:06,534 --> 01:21:10,904
get a Xanax, and
definitely a therapist.

1207
01:21:12,139 --> 01:21:13,775
- Little boy.
- Little?

1208
01:21:14,743 --> 01:21:16,811
Please. Nothing on me is little.

1209
01:21:16,845 --> 01:21:20,347
My pirate name is Long
Dong Silver, bitch.

1210
01:21:20,381 --> 01:21:21,415
Kill the noisy one.

1211
01:21:24,918 --> 01:21:25,720
Please.

1212
01:21:27,087 --> 01:21:29,356
Do you do everything
Hagzilla tells you to?

1213
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:32,226
She probably keeps your balls
in a jar on her nightstand.

1214
01:21:36,363 --> 01:21:38,232
Guys. Guys. What's
the safe word?

1215
01:21:51,979 --> 01:21:53,815
Demons cannot own us.

1216
01:22:04,958 --> 01:22:08,328
All who oppose
me die by my hand.

1217
01:22:09,798 --> 01:22:11,533
Keep sweet talkin' me, lady.

1218
01:22:26,714 --> 01:22:28,449
Only I get to kill that one.

1219
01:22:43,363 --> 01:22:46,400
Welcome to my world, witch.

1220
01:22:51,371 --> 01:22:53,575
I get to go kill your brother.

1221
01:22:56,043 --> 01:22:59,213
Oh, shit. Holy shit! Oh, shit!

1222
01:23:03,585 --> 01:23:06,353
No!

1223
01:23:06,386 --> 01:23:07,221
Mabry.

1224
01:23:08,255 --> 01:23:10,491
No!

1225
01:23:10,525 --> 01:23:11,358
No!

1226
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:32,547
Oh, no.

1227
01:23:33,781 --> 01:23:35,683
Benny?

1228
01:23:35,717 --> 01:23:36,651
No!

1229
01:23:36,684 --> 01:23:40,020
Ah, no! You little! Ah!

1230
01:23:40,053 --> 01:23:41,154
Mabry, Mabry, she's in!

1231
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,089
How do I close it?

1232
01:23:43,691 --> 01:23:44,592
The passage.

1233
01:23:44,626 --> 01:23:45,927
Recite the passage three times.

1234
01:23:53,635 --> 01:23:56,604
Miah!

1235
01:24:41,181 --> 01:24:43,417
Mabry! We gotta open it.

1236
01:24:43,450 --> 01:24:44,552
Open the gate!

1237
01:24:44,586 --> 01:24:46,486
We gotta get him back!

1238
01:24:46,521 --> 01:24:48,155
Please.

1239
01:24:48,188 --> 01:24:49,724
I'm sorry, kid.

1240
01:24:49,757 --> 01:24:51,291
Mabry, open the fucking gate!

1241
01:24:52,225 --> 01:24:53,126
We can't.

1242
01:24:56,698 --> 01:25:00,100
If we open the gate back
up, they come back through,

1243
01:25:01,335 --> 01:25:02,971
and it all starts over again.

1244
01:25:08,375 --> 01:25:09,276
I'm sorry, kid.

1245
01:25:13,347 --> 01:25:14,682
I am so sorry.

1246
01:25:18,251 --> 01:25:22,957
Please.

1247
01:26:31,826 --> 01:26:34,028
I'll fix this, Miah.

1248
01:26:47,742 --> 01:26:51,411
When you're a kid,
Halloween is about dressing up

1249
01:26:51,445 --> 01:26:54,982
in costumes, getting candy,

1250
01:26:55,016 --> 01:26:56,617
pulling pranks,

1251
01:26:56,651 --> 01:26:57,985
celebrating the spooky.

1252
01:27:00,054 --> 01:27:02,123
You think that the scary
stuff around you is

1253
01:27:02,156 --> 01:27:04,192
all for fun and
nothing can harm you.

1254
01:27:05,960 --> 01:27:09,063
A year ago we learned
the reality is

1255
01:27:11,666 --> 01:27:12,834
that's not true.

1256
01:27:15,169 --> 01:27:16,436
Happy Halloween.

1257
01:27:19,073 --> 01:27:22,476
Oh, Mother Ferris, not again.
