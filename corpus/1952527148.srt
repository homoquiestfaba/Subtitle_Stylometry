AIRLINE DISASTER
Translation: Pix

2
00:00:55,599 --> 00:00:58,698
Good afternoon.
I'm Glenn Russell,

3
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:04,396
and is an honor to announce the trip
Starquest's inaugural program.

4
00:01:10,632 --> 00:01:14,129
It offers the best
Aerodynamic design

5
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:17,229
to reduce
Fuel consumption;

6
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:20,129
computerized controls
sophisticated

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:25,361
and what we believe to be the experience
more pleasant to fly today.

8
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:37,928
And now, at this point, I would like to
present chief pilot Joseph Franklin

9
00:01:37,962 --> 00:01:40,193
Bill Alexander and his copilot.

10
00:01:44,461 --> 00:01:46,526
Thank you very much!
-Joe, Joe!

11
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,253
The Starquest boasts
be totally

12
00:01:48,254 --> 00:01:50,793
automatic since the
takeoff to landing.

13
00:01:50,828 --> 00:01:55,459
Are you afraid of this plan to replace it,
that replace all pilots?

14
00:01:55,494 --> 00:01:58,291
No, no. We love to fly.

15
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,291
Also, you always
will need pilots.

16
00:02:00,326 --> 00:02:03,626
Who will point when you
are flying over the Grand Canyon?

17
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:21,624
And here you are.

18
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:24,189
Calm down!

19
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:26,389
Sorry ... was reflex.

20
00:02:26,424 --> 00:02:28,056
Reflection?

21
00:02:28,091 --> 00:02:30,789
Great reflection. You will
it is our security?

22
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:32,823
No.

23
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,055
Something special?

24
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:37,055
Paperwork. Diplomatic thing.

25
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,288
None of your business ... whoever.

26
00:02:40,323 --> 00:02:42,287
Okay, you two are good.

27
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:43,662
-Thanks, man.
"Sure.

28
00:02:43,697 --> 00:02:45,321
Take care.

29
00:02:47,122 --> 00:02:50,187
That sucks you should
stop at the limit, Gina.

30
00:02:50,222 --> 00:02:52,453
Yes, well ...

31
00:02:52,488 --> 00:02:54,701
I feel that the Secret Service
get me out of my field

32
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:57,053
sending to the safety
the President's brother.

33
00:02:57,088 --> 00:03:02,419
-So the ball will never get me.
-Actually, it would be the right field.

34
00:03:02,453 --> 00:03:04,452
Is.

35
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:08,086
There you are

36
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,119
Take care.
Thank you.

37
00:03:32,985 --> 00:03:34,950
Hello?

38
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:36,950
Hi, dear. You watching?

39
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:39,750
Hi! No, nothing in the news yet.

40
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,583
Just some pretty pictures of the plane.

41
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:45,016
Gwen is looking at the conference
press onto YouTube.

42
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,083
What the ...?

43rd
00:03:46,117 --> 00:03:49,215
Hey! Look at the verbiage, young lady.

44
00:03:49,249 --> 00:03:51,215
I really wanted to be here.

45
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:53,215
I wish we were there, too.

46
00:03:53,249 --> 00:03:56,248
No, you do not.
-Yeah, right.

47
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:58,048
Oh, man. I still can not find.

48
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:00,047
Hey Gwen, prepare to go to school.

49
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:02,047
Joe, I gotta go.

50
00:04:02,082 --> 00:04:07,081
I love you. Take care of everything, and I
I'll be back for the weekend.

51
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:10,113
-Right. I love you.
-Bye.

52
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,108
This was a TV interview today.

53
00:05:10,142 --> 00:05:12,208
Joe, you got the look on the radio.

54
00:05:16,642 --> 00:05:18,507
Someone stole all
our equipment.

55
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,907
Let us, Joe. Forget the crap
flight old-fashioned.

56
00:05:23,941 --> 00:05:26,007
This is not fly, Billy.

57
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,607
This is videogame.

58
00:05:28,641 --> 00:05:31,723
Joe, you're a grouchy,
grizzled, old Gaga.

59
00:05:31,724 --> 00:05:34,739
Just sit back and enjoy
your retirement.

60
00:05:34,773 --> 00:05:38,271
Counting the minutes. Counting the minutes
until he can retire away from you

61
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:42,005
with my wife, children, in a
beach in Barbados. And without Billy.

62
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:45,038
It looks delicious. Okay,
Let us prepare.

63
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:55,604
-Hydraulic ...
-Adjusted.

64
00:05:55,638 --> 00:05:57,604
Emergency-Lights ...
-Prepared.

65
00:05:57,638 --> 00:05:59,536
E-key phone ...
-Disabled.

66th
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:01,536
Anti-Ice System ...

67
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:04,603
And no. This should be disabled,
and is disabled.

68
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:08,202
I know how to fly this thing.
Do not worry, right?

69
00:06:08,236 --> 00:06:10,769
Ladies and gentlemen,
're number one for takeoff.

70
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,835
Make sure your belts
Security is tight

71
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:14,835
, and their chairs are upright

72
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:16,868
, and in the locked position.

73
00:06:18,103 --> 00:06:21,602
Time to shake. Remember,
five minutes in and out.

74
00:07:40,228 --> 00:07:42,194
-Molly? Molly ...?
Where's your ...?

75
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:45,094
Go kids!
Children go, run!

76
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:49,193
No. Run! No, no!

77
00:07:49,953 --> 00:07:51,226
Children go, run!

78
00:07:51,327 --> 00:07:53,226
No, no!

79
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:58,025
You bastard!

80
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,946
-Remember ...
-No!

81
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:00,225
If you cause a problem,

82
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:03,258
will be much worse for their children.

83
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:14,157
"Come on.
-Go!

84
00:08:14,192 --> 00:08:17,423
Come on.

85
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,957
Anda ... Come on!

86
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:24,156
Freeze!

87
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:26,156
No!

88
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:28,389
Down!

89
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:29,422
Tie the children!

90
00:08:29,457 --> 00:08:31,456
No!

91
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,722
-No!
-Hey!

92
00:08:33,756 --> 00:08:35,755
Do not forget ...

93
00:08:47,377 --> 00:08:49,121
You are hurting my arm!

94
00:08:54,688 --> 00:08:57,187
-Mother ...
-No!

95
00:09:04,621 --> 00:09:07,186
Stay down, guys, look ...

96
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,852
We have problems.

97
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:13,886
Damn!

98
00:09:15,752 --> 00:09:18,185
Go, go, go, go!

99
00:09:18,219 --> 00:09:20,218
Hey, go! Go!

100
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,915
Mama ...

101
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:05,681
Quiet!

102
00:10:05,715 --> 00:10:07,714
Shoot him!

103rd
00:10:11,914 --> 00:10:15,479
No!

104
00:10:18,913 --> 00:10:20,912
Calm down, Fred!

105
00:10:31,446 --> 00:10:35,444
Yes.

106
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:49,710
Melville. What? Damn!

107
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:52,743
Make sure the residents were there.
I'm heading.

108
00:10:55,077 --> 00:11:00,075
-Let me know so I have something new.
-Right.

109
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:05,675
FBI agent Melville ...
Julius Reed, the Secret Service.

110
00:11:05,709 --> 00:11:07,675
What is the situation?

111
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,675
The maid of Franklin,
Molly, is dead.

112
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:12,507
We seek fingerprints, and we
begin to investigate the neighborhood.

113
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,074
Great. There is something that
can help me with this?

114
00:11:15,108 --> 00:11:17,974
What about the surveillance system?
Already there?

115
00:11:18,008 --> 00:11:20,874
That surveillance system?

116
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:23,973
-Go children, run!
6-We install monitoring cameras.

117
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:27,806
-So should show everything that happened.
-No!

118
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,372
Beauty. The way these
guys are heads down,

119
00:11:30,406 --> 00:11:35,405
we have to search to try
get a photo for identification.

120
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,705
Yes, sir, Director.

121
00:11:40,739 --> 00:11:43,237
I understand that you need
inform the President.

122
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:47,237
Yes, sir. Send details as soon
we have more to continue.

123
00:11:47,272 --> 00:11:51,804
Yes, sir ... Yes, sir;
we find them.

124
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,837
Let's find them.

125
00:11:56,004 --> 00:11:58,003
Fortunately, they are still alive.

126
00:12:02,104 --> 00:12:04,103
Expert!

127
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:18,791
You're late!

128
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:20,569
-Come on.
-Shut up!

129
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:22,601
Mom!

130
00:12:26,101 --> 00:12:28,100
Mommy!

131
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,833
No! No!

132
00:12:31,868 --> 00:12:33,833
"Come on, its useless!
Mother!

133
00:12:33,868 --> 00:12:35,833
-Where are we going?
Mother!

134
00:12:35,868 --> 00:12:37,833
Mother! Mom!
-Freeze!

135
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,799
Mom! Help!

136
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:47,532
Gwen! Michael!

137
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,566
No! Mom!

138
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:55,431
Got it?

139
00:12:56,232 --> 00:12:58,364
You what?

140
00:13:05,497 --> 00:13:07,396
What do you want?

141
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:11,664
What do you want? What you ...

142
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:14,696
Morning Edition.

143
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:21,328
Right. Let's leave it
ready for your photo.

144
00:13:27,663 --> 00:13:30,361
Come, get up!

145
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:32,394
Talk to me!

146
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:39,360
Strip.

147
00:13:39,394 --> 00:13:43,393
No. No. .. No!

148
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:50,660
No.

149
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:31,056
Look at me, tell the truth!

150
00:14:39,856 --> 00:14:41,821
-Get in!
-Hi. Babies, I'm here.

151
00:14:41,856 --> 00:14:42,642
Mom! Mother! "

152
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:43,821
-You're right.
"Oh, no.

153
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:48,387
I have, I have it.

154
00:15:02,521 --> 00:15:05,319
Lord ... sir.

155
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:07,686
Lord ... I'm sorry, sir,

156
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:11,019
but it was only the announcement that
could use your cell phone.

157
00:15:11,053 --> 00:15:13,019
The seat belt warning
Security remains connected.

158
00:15:13,053 --> 00:15:15,019
Is it? Sorry.

159
00:15:15,053 --> 00:15:17,218
No problem.

160
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,384
Lord?

161
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:21,785
-Jennifer, right?
-I need to sit down, sir.

162
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:24,284
I need to show you something.

163
00:15:24,318 --> 00:15:26,151
Oh, my God.

164
00:15:26,185 --> 00:15:27,851
What the hell is that?

165
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:30,651
My agents called me.
The pilot's family was kidnapped.

166
00:15:30,685 --> 00:15:34,716
You need to go get it and
bring it back to talk to me.

167
00:15:34,751 --> 00:15:37,950
"Who are you?
-I'm just an analyst with the FBI, right?

168
00:15:37,984 --> 00:15:43,683
They knew I was on vacation, they know
I'm on that flight. So I contacted.

169
00:15:43,717 --> 00:15:49,715
So, if you can get him and bring him
back, I'll be here, right?

170
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,079
Hey, princess.

171
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,278
It's Jen. She is alone?

172
00:16:30,312 --> 00:16:33,111
-I think so.
"She can bring us champagne?

173
00:16:33,146 --> 00:16:37,377
You're a figure ...
Have you worked?

174
00:16:46,411 --> 00:16:51,376
Joe has ... has something very
important that I need to show you.

175
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,976
Sure, Nate. Go ahead
unlock the door, let it go.

176
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:56,010
Yes, sir.

177
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,708
Sit.

178
00:17:16,508 --> 00:17:18,607
And tadpoles as well.

179
00:17:18,642 --> 00:17:21,873
As you can see today's newspaper.

180
00:17:26,674 --> 00:17:32,205
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen, please.

181
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,167
First, to cooperate ...

182
00:17:35,168 --> 00:17:38,338
nobody will get hurt.

183
00:17:38,372 --> 00:17:42,971
<i> Secondly, we are all
heavily armed, and you do not. </ i>

184
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:47,171
Without heroes, and nobody dies.

185
00:17:47,205 --> 00:17:49,170
Then just sit ...

186
00:17:49,204 --> 00:17:53,604
enjoy complimentary peanuts,
and not annoy my brothers.

187
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:58,037
Thirdly ... are not
terrorists, this is not a jihad.

188
00:17:58,071 --> 00:18:02,369
Our demands are very simple, all
want to go home late at night.

189
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:07,502
<i> So be good sheep, do
I say, and nobody dies. </ i>

190
00:18:08,637 --> 00:18:13,702
My brothers will come from the booth
to collect their phones.

191
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:19,101
<i> Remember, your cooperation
guarantees that no one gets hurt. </ i>

192
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:22,434
That <i> ...</ i>

193
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,834
Submit only the
nice men and women.

194
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:35,600
And finally, for
security guard ...

195
00:18:35,635 --> 00:18:41,633
No heroes, and nobody will
die. Remember that.

196th
00:18:57,832 --> 00:19:01,831
<i> Coast 8-5-Heavy,
what is the emergency? </ i>

197
00:19:03,899 --> 00:19:07,397
<i> Coast 8-5-Heavy,
what is the emergency? </ i>

198
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:10,196
He has a gun
pointed at his face.

199
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,996
Now ... open the door.

200
00:19:34,229 --> 00:19:36,728
Então é a sua filha.

201
00:19:38,194 --> 00:19:43,860
Wait a minute! Right?
Wait a little, slowly.

202
00:19:43,895 --> 00:19:48,894
Pane ... bassline,
central section has a blue button.

203
00:19:50,628 --> 00:19:52,627
Good boy.

204
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:14,957
Come on. Come on.

205
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:19,090
Hello. Hello? Forget
Static bad on the phone.

206
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:21,624
Here is the Agent
Special Gina Vitale.

207
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,123
I'm in the middle of a
emergency.

208
00:20:32,056 --> 00:20:33,489
-Mrs. President.
-Good morning, Ms. President.

209
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:37,288
Thank you. Please
okay, someone begins.

210
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,355
Who's down?

211
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:41,588
Nathan Polansky. He
is one of the browsers.

212
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:43,588
They shot him.

213
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:45,921
And who the hell are "they"?

214
00:20:45,955 --> 00:20:47,504
Our guess, of Aryan Brotherhood.

215
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:50,004
The guy in the cockpit or
has a mole on the eye

216
00:20:50,005 --> 00:20:52,154
or tattoo a teardrop-shaped.

217
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:55,687
-Does Joe know about Annette?
-He knows, Frank ... He already knows.

218
00:20:55,722 --> 00:20:56,921
How?

219
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,361
The guy in the booth
Joe gave a cell phone.

220
00:20:58,362 --> 00:21:00,520
He spoke with one of
Our staff on site.

221
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:02,175
DeToro, contact the Starquest.

222
00:21:02,176 --> 00:21:05,419
I have to talk to Joe before
making any decisions.

223
00:21:05,453 --> 00:21:07,119
Yes, Mrs. President.

224
00:21:07,153 --> 00:21:11,152
What is the nearest airport that
they could land, military or civilian?

225
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,919
Well, probably are
on the South Carolina now.

226
00:21:13,953 --> 00:21:16,752
There are six airports
main, and not know, thirty,

227
00:21:16,753 --> 00:21:18,619
forty airports
aviation in general.

228
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:21,351
We have five bases
Air Force in South Carolina

229
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:24,417
But only two commercially
behave the Starquest.

230
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:26,484
-And the military?
-We are well.

231
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:29,083
What? Well, get it.

232
00:21:29,118 --> 00:21:32,483
We have a Secret Service agent
assigned to his brother.

233
00:21:32,518 --> 00:21:34,752
Sure, Agent Vitale.
You're on speaker

234
00:21:34,753 --> 00:21:36,783
with the president.
What can you tell us?

235
00:21:36,818 --> 00:21:40,682
Has at least ten of them
board. They are all armed.

236
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,050
They have control of
plane. They had been shot

237
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:47,516
fired, but it seems
the plane was not affected.

238
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,582
-Are you in a safe place?
"Yes, yes.

239
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:51,616
I did this by compartments
below the plane.

240
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:54,398
Vitale're saying
can walk freely around?

241
00:21:54,399 --> 00:21:55,315
Yes, ma'am.

242
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,115
Let's take the forms
Complete aircraft.

243
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,947
Okay, so Vitale, the
know about electronics?

244
00:21:59,982 --> 00:22:01,981
<i>'ll learn much more about that. </ i>

245
00:22:02,015 --> 00:22:04,514
Sure, it might be useful.

246
00:22:09,048 --> 00:22:13,046
His complete obedience
avoid any victim today.

247
00:22:26,713 --> 00:22:28,745
Madam, the companions
arrived, and we have contact.

248
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:30,078
I'll put them on speaker.

249
00:22:30,112 --> 00:22:33,244
Bravo, Tango-one, you're in
speaker and speaking with the boss.

250
00:22:33,278 --> 00:22:35,811
Our call sign
will be Bravo-Tango-6.

251
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:37,811
<i> Roger, Six.
In waiting. </ I>

252
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:40,176
Bravo-Tango-1
Here is President Franklin.

253
00:22:40,211 --> 00:22:43,010
Tell me what you see and what it means.

254
00:22:43,044 --> 00:22:46,076
The plane seems to still be piloted
by a competent crew.

255
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:50,110
I do not see any evidence of
mechanical problems with the aircraft.

256
00:22:56,443 --> 00:22:59,642
I want you to put your
sister on the line for me.

257
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:04,675
Think it is easy to catch
e. .. the phone?

258
00:23:08,709 --> 00:23:11,241
ATC, here is the Coasteira
8-5-Heavy.

259
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:14,574
Could open a channel
to the White House,

260
00:23:14,609 --> 00:23:16,840
so that we could
communicate to Ms. President?

261
00:23:17,675 --> 00:23:20,273
Mrs. President, here is the Starquest.

262
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:23,974
Mrs. President, is really an honor.

263
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:26,807
Let me talk to Joe.
I want to hear his voice.

264
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,172
Here is Captain Joe Franklin
Mrs. President.

265
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:30,906
Do whatever is necessary.

266
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,472
Very noble.

267
00:23:32,507 --> 00:23:34,939
Sure, you have my
attention. Whatever?

268
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:38,572
Ten of my Aryan Brothers are arrested
stupid government charges

269
00:23:38,607 --> 00:23:41,571
a federal penitentiary
the state of New Jersey.

270
00:23:41,606 --> 00:23:44,337
I want his release
immediately and unconditionally.

271
00:23:44,372 --> 00:23:45,437
Names?

272
00:23:45,472 --> 00:23:47,904
Ask the Director.

273
00:23:47,938 --> 00:23:51,804
Know that our policy is
not negotiate with terrorists.

274
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:54,570
Yes, I knew it would be a game.

275
00:23:54,605 --> 00:23:56,904
But Joe here, and his family,

276
00:23:56,938 --> 00:24:01,470
have been generous enough in
give me an insurance policy.

277
00:24:01,505 --> 00:24:03,103
I see.

278
00:24:03,137 --> 00:24:05,136
Know what I want.

279
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:15,768
Empty fuel.

280
00:24:19,536 --> 00:24:21,535
Okay, okay.

281
00:24:37,634 --> 00:24:40,867
6, here is one. The Starquest is
draining fuel.

282
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,063
6, this is Bravo-Tango-2.
Just lost

283
00:24:49,064 --> 00:24:51,565
Bravo-Tango-3 for the emptying
fuel.

284
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,331
6, here are two. She is going
to a population center.

285
00:25:03,098 --> 00:25:04,964
The pilot came out?

286
00:25:04,998 --> 00:25:08,497
Sorry, ma'am. We have
visuals on a ramp.

287
00:25:10,865 --> 00:25:12,830
Vitale, go pro side panel.

288
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:14,829
Yes.

289
00:25:14,864 --> 00:25:17,896
We need you to replace
manually dump fuel.

290
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,896
I am here ... what
I'm looking for?

291
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,840
Find something that says "Dump
fuel emergency "

292
00:25:22,841 --> 00:25:24,295
"Release of fuel,"
something.

293
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,895
Looks like a Christmas tree.
The whole thing lit up.

294
00:25:26,929 --> 00:25:29,628
I do not ... wait.

295
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:31,628
Wait a minute.

296
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:33,628
What about "release
fuel emergency "?

297
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:35,427
Probably it is.

298
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:39,660
Listen. Need to press
this button and hold it.

299th
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:43,926
Ready.

300
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:46,382
The agent stopped Vitale
emptying of fuel.

301
00:25:49,994 --> 00:25:51,960
The fuel is not draining.
He stopped being emptied.

302
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:55,826
"I did not tell him to stop.
"I did not quit, never stopped!

303
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:57,826
Is not responding.

304
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:04,525
I think all this will
let us expel it.

305
00:26:12,909 --> 00:26:18,591
Mrs. President ... we have only
90 minutes of fuel.

306
00:26:18,625 --> 00:26:21,123
You know what to do.

307
00:26:26,657 --> 00:26:28,514
How long before
accordance with clear images

308
00:26:28,515 --> 00:26:30,456
enough to pass
by the NCIC and CODIS?

309
00:26:30,491 --> 00:26:32,956
I have a clue about Karl Hitler.

310
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,555
Have nothing. If I had changed
legally in prison

311
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:38,321
five years would be a penalty
ten years for bank robbery.

312
00:26:38,356 --> 00:26:40,921
An armed bank robbery to help
finance the Aryan Brotherhood.

313
00:26:40,956 --> 00:26:43,555
Arians? Great.
Heavily armed psychopaths.

314
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,855
He checked the address it here?

315
00:26:44,856 --> 00:26:47,387
The parole agent
said it is up to date.

316
00:26:47,421 --> 00:26:49,721
We will make sure
he is still there.

317
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:51,403
Tell Terry to mount a
mobile team in five minutes,

318
00:26:51,404 --> 00:26:53,087
and talk to bring
plenty of ammunition.

319
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:12,985
So it was great.
They came running ...

320
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:17,251
Take him out.
Now look, Snake.

321
00:27:17,286 --> 00:27:19,251
Mother! "

322
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:23,017
Honey.
Here, here, look at me.

323
00:27:25,486 --> 00:27:29,484
Right.
So, good job.

324
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:48,882
Hey, hear that?

325
00:27:52,516 --> 00:27:55,047
Where do you think is going?

326
00:27:55,082 --> 00:27:58,314
-See our guests ..?
No, it will not.

327th
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,348
Sit.

328
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:07,018
Run as fast as possible on the road.
Get help to us, right?

329
00:28:10,348 --> 00:28:12,347
Harry?

330th
00:28:13,614 --> 00:28:15,613
Why me?

331
00:28:17,947 --> 00:28:21,946
How about "because I told you so"?

332
00:28:23,446 --> 00:28:25,445
Come on!

333
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,911
-Damn!
-Mommy, Mommy!

334
00:28:45,011 --> 00:28:47,010
Damn!

335
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:50,409
Because I had to do this?

336
00:28:50,444 --> 00:28:52,409
Do not worry, Snake.
Let's get them.

337
00:28:52,444 --> 00:28:54,409
-No!
Drop-it, bitch!

338
00:28:54,444 --> 00:28:58,442
-Stop it!
-If you move, you will die.

339
00:29:53,104 --> 00:29:55,604
Okay, go with Dad.
Come on!

340
00:30:01,303 --> 00:30:03,302
Hey, kid!

341
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:07,802
I'm your sister!

342
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:19,801
Now that I have your attention,
let me tell you something.

343
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:23,267
And believe me,
I'm talking about pretty serious.

344
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:28,067
Next time ...
will be in her head.

345
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:36,800
Sure, you have five seconds
get back here, or already was!

346
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,833
A!

347
00:30:40,967 --> 00:30:42,966
Two!

348
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,566
Three!

349
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:52,898
Do not!

350
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:57,065
Get him!

351
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:05,764
"You okay?
-I want to go home!

352
00:31:05,798 --> 00:31:07,797
Here.

353
00:31:07,898 --> 00:31:09,797
Move over, kids!

354
00:31:18,464 --> 00:31:22,195
Bravo-Tango-1
stay far away and firm.

355
00:31:22,229 --> 00:31:26,228
In the current trajectory, how long will
before they fly over the Atlantic,

356
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:28,595
know, far from the populated areas?

357
00:31:28,629 --> 00:31:30,628
About twenty minutes.

358
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:38,761
Well, if the plane is on autopilot,
we can not assume it, get it back?

359
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:42,393
We can not attempt to override
the whole pattern of his flight?

360
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:46,226
Well, it's self.
There is no signal to be blocked.

361
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:48,712
There is another option.
We are working on

362
00:31:48,713 --> 00:31:51,392
an emergency system
named "Kitty Hawk"

363
00:31:51,427 --> 00:31:55,692
it allows us to take control
in flight and redirect it.

364
00:31:55,726 --> 00:31:57,450
To be more specific,
is an unfolding

365
00:31:57,451 --> 00:31:59,292
the vehicle program
unmanned aerial.

366
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:02,216
We are doing some testing
Preliminary adaptation

367
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:05,058
this technology for use in
civil aircraft compromised.

368
00:32:05,092 --> 00:32:07,791
Right then, as
time for the satellite?

369
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:10,825
We are now working on it.
Ten, fifteen minutes?

370
00:32:17,291 --> 00:32:21,723
Hey, Willie, already found
that security?

371
00:32:21,758 --> 00:32:23,924
I'm still looking.

372
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:27,189
Well .. start to shoot people

373
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,222
until that bastard appear.

374
00:32:39,823 --> 00:32:43,287
You! You're the security officer?

375
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:46,187
"You look like a porthole. You is it?
-No.

376
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:48,187
Hell, you're so ...

377
00:32:50,221 --> 00:32:53,954
Shut up! Shut up!

378th
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:58,286
Hey, Willie, now what?
Was he safe?

379
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:03,386
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

380
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:06,419
-What?
-Hey!

381
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,519
Want to help me here?

382
00:33:10,554 --> 00:33:12,618
I do not know where he is.

383
00:33:12,653 --> 00:33:15,919
You do not need it.

384
00:33:15,953 --> 00:33:18,217
Where does this go?
Where will this lead?

385
00:33:18,252 --> 00:33:21,552
I. .. downstairs.
Cargo compartment.

386
00:33:21,586 --> 00:33:23,584
C'mon.

387
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:37,650
I know that is where the agent
Security is hiding.

388
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:42,049
I'm feeling.

389
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:45,282
What do you ..?!

390
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:50,248
Okay, dear.

391
00:34:11,714 --> 00:34:13,012
We have a problem.

392
00:34:13,047 --> 00:34:16,046
We lost the autopilot.

393
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:22,779
They're obviously taking
difficulty controlling the aircraft.

394
00:34:25,112 --> 00:34:26,912
And we can not
take control?

395
00:34:26,946 --> 00:34:28,945
Not yet.

396
00:34:29,279 --> 00:34:32,912
We'll have to leave Joe
do your job.

397
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:34,911
Joe?

398
00:34:34,945 --> 00:34:38,344
The man up there, Bill.
I have total confidence in Joe.

399
00:34:38,378 --> 00:34:40,377
Okay, let's go.

400
00:34:53,044 --> 00:34:55,043
Come on!

401
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:23,873
We will get well soon
near those buildings.

402
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,372
Come on, Billy, get it!

403
00:35:34,406 --> 00:35:37,906
-I can not handle it!
"Come on, Billy! Raise it!

404
00:36:12,437 --> 00:36:14,935
It's happening again!

405
00:36:24,101 --> 00:36:27,600
I think the rotating stabilizers
are functioning again.

406
00:36:30,301 --> 00:36:33,033
This autopilot broke down.

407
00:36:33,034 --> 00:36:36,500
I do not think we'll retrieve it.

408
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:39,066
Do not worry about the pilot
Automatic. You got me here.

409
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,833
While on board, I am
the control of the aircraft, right?

410
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,766
What happened to the pilot
automatic, gentlemen?

411
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,799
I do not know.

412
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:03,798
Give me a hand.

413
00:37:07,565 --> 00:37:09,330
You're the security officer?

414
00:37:09,364 --> 00:37:11,363
No.

415
00:37:11,464 --> 00:37:13,996
A cop?

416
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:16,496
Who are you?

417
00:37:16,531 --> 00:37:19,563
Only the right person at
wrong place at the wrong time.

418
00:37:19,597 --> 00:37:24,529
That's it.
Are you okay?

419
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:26,562
No.

420
00:37:26,596 --> 00:37:30,094
Just ... hold on tight.

421
00:37:31,729 --> 00:37:33,728
Buster!

422
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:44,227
-Idiot!
-No!

423
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:58,859
Stop, stop!

424th
00:38:02,593 --> 00:38:04,725
Damn!

425
00:38:04,759 --> 00:38:08,758
-Robert will kill you ...
-Shut up!

426
00:38:10,258 --> 00:38:12,224
Willie is dead, man.

427
00:38:12,258 --> 00:38:15,224
Really?

428
00:38:15,258 --> 00:38:19,424
That should be simple and enjoyable
As Robert said!

429
00:38:19,458 --> 00:38:22,089
Yes, well, not Robert
is simple and enjoyable.

430
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,484
Is she?
Who killed Willie?

431
00:39:24,519 --> 00:39:27,250
Yes, of course it is.

432nd
00:39:27,285 --> 00:39:33,250
Cursed Willie. Leaving
be killed by a whore.

433
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:38,517
Come on. Let's say that Robert
found the security guard.

434
00:39:38,551 --> 00:39:41,549
I do not ...
Tell you.

435
00:39:56,382 --> 00:40:00,381
Here is the special agent
Vitale, 2-9-4-8-3.

436
00:40:00,416 --> 00:40:02,847
Yes, I'm still in season.

437
00:40:02,882 --> 00:40:05,792
You can put me on hold,
but keep writing

438
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:08,346
and I will continue talking
in ... Thank you.

439
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:11,691
One of the kidnappers
is dead. I am using

440
00:40:11,692 --> 00:40:15,213
his phone ... Perhaps
can get a signal.

441
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:18,813
You know what ... 'll
send his number.

442
00:40:18,847 --> 00:40:20,579
Maybe you could get an address.

443
00:40:20,614 --> 00:40:22,678
But ... Hello?
Yes!

444
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:26,178
Agent Vitale, is in
back in with the president.

445
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:28,512
Agent Vitale, what's the latest?

446
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:33,044
<i> Some passengers were killed.
From their side, there is a low. </ I>

447
00:40:33,078 --> 00:40:37,343
<i> confirm my original estimate
ten hijackers. </ i>

448
00:40:37,378 --> 00:40:39,477
Can contact
with the security guard?

449
00:40:41,512 --> 00:40:43,577
Agent Vitale?

450
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:46,076
God.

451
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,736
The governor of Carolina
South wants to activate

452
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:49,176
units of
Air National Guard

453
00:40:49,211 --> 00:40:53,242
with orders to shoot down the plane,
cross the airspace of its cities.

454
00:40:53,277 --> 00:40:55,309
-And the idiot wants to be president.
-Yes.

455
00:40:55,343 --> 00:40:58,142
If the order to shoot
is a given, it will come to me.

456
00:40:58,176 --> 00:41:00,742
-Let this clear.
"I will tell you.

457
00:41:00,777 --> 00:41:04,141
We learned that his brother
has control of the aircraft.

458
00:41:04,175 --> 00:41:08,409
Mrs. President, we confirm
ten Aryan Brotherhood in Fairton.

459
00:41:08,442 --> 00:41:09,775
Why are they in prison?

460
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:13,340
They fired for about an arsenal
five, trying to get some weapons.

461
00:41:13,375 --> 00:41:17,508
We lost three ATF agents.

462
00:41:17,542 --> 00:41:19,307
How are we with the satellite?

463
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:21,466
We have an uplink to
alive, but the integrity

464
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:23,640
data with
ailerons was compromised.

465
00:41:23,674 --> 00:41:25,172
Committed to?

466
00:41:25,207 --> 00:41:26,697
There is a flaw in
somewhere in the system

467
00:41:26,698 --> 00:41:28,339
causing
communication problems

468
00:41:28,374 --> 00:41:32,238
between the cockpit and the servants who
are controlling the ailerons.

469
00:41:32,273 --> 00:41:36,539
If the failures continue, I fear that
we may lose control of the aircraft.

470
00:41:36,573 --> 00:41:38,406
We have a connection with the Starquest.

471
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,905
Okay, turn it on.

472
00:41:42,939 --> 00:41:46,405
Mrs. President ... How are
my brothers Aryans?

473
00:41:46,439 --> 00:41:49,137
We are talking to
director. How are you, Joe?

474
00:41:49,171 --> 00:41:53,170
I'm fine, Mrs. President. So
as in Ice Fishing Point George.

475th
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:59,236
We are isolating the ten brothers.

476
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:02,370
Isolating or releasing <i> </ i>

477
00:42:02,405 --> 00:42:05,003
For now, we are isolating them.

478th
00:42:05,037 --> 00:42:07,035
Isolating ...

479
00:42:10,003 --> 00:42:12,502
This is what the isolation buying ...

480
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:17,002
But damn!

481
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:19,834
So you're thinking of
play in the water below?

482
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:24,534
Bill will redirect this flight for us
lead to all East Coast cities.

483
00:42:24,568 --> 00:42:29,834
If we play down and rains will
debris throughout the east coast.

484
00:42:31,402 --> 00:42:34,200
Bill, make a new plan
flight for me, could you?

485
00:42:34,234 --> 00:42:36,233
Now!

486
00:42:41,768 --> 00:42:44,266
Do not mess with me.

487
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:53,898
What is our next step?

488
00:42:53,932 --> 00:42:56,731
Okay, let's go get something to
to focus on Point George.

489
00:42:56,766 --> 00:42:58,731
Why is that?

490
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:02,063
Because they never ice fished Point
George. So something is happening there.

491
00:43:02,098 --> 00:43:04,097
We're with him.

492
00:43:20,497 --> 00:43:25,562
Lord, that combines with a truck
image we have a camera of a bank

493
00:43:25,597 --> 00:43:29,028
in the area where the kidnappers
the van disappeared.

494
00:43:29,062 --> 00:43:32,361
And they are stationed in
front of the house of Karl Hitler.

495
00:43:32,396 --> 00:43:34,461
What a surprise.

496
00:43:34,496 --> 00:43:39,160
The best approach is to use the bank
and then take the truck to cover.

497
00:43:39,195 --> 00:43:41,160
That still leaves the
front windows.

498
00:43:41,195 --> 00:43:44,226
Collins, you will monitor and
warn you if see any movement.

499
00:43:44,261 --> 00:43:47,494
Let's break down doors and shoot them
before they can react.

500
00:43:47,528 --> 00:43:51,026
Today, nobody dies
only the bad, right?

501
00:43:52,861 --> 00:43:54,860
Taken control of the airplane.

502
00:43:54,894 --> 00:43:56,851
Although the statute of
passenger safety

503
00:43:56,852 --> 00:43:58,892
is unknown, there
various speculations for ...

504
00:44:00,326 --> 00:44:03,324
First team to go and
be in a position now.

505
00:44:11,558 --> 00:44:13,524
You will not end?

506
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:16,223
Damn it, man. Damn day long.

507
00:44:21,057 --> 00:44:24,056
Mrs. President, the satellite has
and a lock is loading.

508th
00:44:24,091 --> 00:44:27,656
How long will it take?
-Five minutes.

509
00:44:27,691 --> 00:44:29,955
Well, let's go. Where,
what is the closest runway?

510
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:31,955
Charleston. We
take them to Charleston.

511
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:33,955
No.
Merritt is a better choice.

512
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:35,955
It is a military base, not civilian.

513
00:44:35,990 --> 00:44:38,988
Let's take them Merritt then.
-Do this.

514
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:47,021
Bill? What is this?

515
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:50,577
We seem
on fire below.

516
00:44:50,578 --> 00:44:52,820
We'll have to come down
and take a look.

517
00:44:52,855 --> 00:44:54,820
No, nobody will leave.

518
00:44:54,855 --> 00:44:56,820
Whether we burn?

519
00:44:56,855 --> 00:45:00,387
I imagine that a plane so advanced
has some way to deal with fire.

520
00:45:00,421 --> 00:45:04,420
-I should go there to see.
"Nobody is going anywhere!

521
00:45:43,216 --> 00:45:45,782
Mrs. President, Kitty Hawk
ready for your command.

522
00:45:45,816 --> 00:45:48,849
How long will it take to get it?
-Just sort.

523
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:50,849
Come on.

524
00:45:50,883 --> 00:45:53,324
Here is General Dillard.
We are ready

525
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:55,881
to take flight.
Again, the bird fly.

526
00:46:08,714 --> 00:46:11,713
Kitty Hawk has a grip
hand with Starquest.

527
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:23,345
Bill ... are you doing this?

528
00:46:23,380 --> 00:46:25,345
What's happening?

529
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,379
I think the autopilot again.

530
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:40,943
I'm setting a
vector of 142.3 to 27,000 feet.

531
00:46:40,978 --> 00:46:43,043
Sure, the place still Merritt
docking closer?

532
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:49,142
It is close now, but I think
we can still do that.

533
00:46:49,177 --> 00:46:53,909
It is as if the plane took control
of itself, except it is erratic.

534
00:46:55,510 --> 00:46:58,009
The flaps are turned down.

535
00:47:02,809 --> 00:47:04,775
At this air speed?

536
00:47:04,809 --> 00:47:07,341
I know, I know. He will rip
wings right out.

537
00:47:07,376 --> 00:47:09,441
But why the hell
is he doing this?

538
00:47:09,476 --> 00:47:11,708
Someone can take the
control of the plane out?

539
00:47:11,743 --> 00:47:15,741
No, not that I know ...
-Robert!

540
00:47:19,708 --> 00:47:22,840
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but it seems that such sudden breakdown

541
00:47:22,874 --> 00:47:26,374
is taking us to the
nearest airport.

542
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:41,705
Okay, let's go.
Come on, raise it.

543
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,738
Something is not right.

544
00:47:54,472 --> 00:47:56,471
She is not responding.

545
00:47:57,838 --> 00:48:00,636
We're going too fast.
We are fighting to hold on to it.

546
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:03,670
What ... You have control or not?

547
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:13,969
Telemetry is all wrong.

548
00:48:23,802 --> 00:48:28,267
It is not responding to input,
she is not responding.

549
00:48:28,301 --> 00:48:30,800
It's coming fast
and too low!

550
00:48:38,967 --> 00:48:40,966
Bravo-Tango-6,
here is Bravo-Tango-1.

551
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:44,432
<i> Starquest going
straight to the city. </ i>

552
00:48:44,467 --> 00:48:47,499
Will have to let it go,
Let Joe take it!

553
00:48:47,533 --> 00:48:49,532
Three minutes to landing.

554
00:49:01,865 --> 00:49:03,864
Okay, c'mon, c'mon.
Lift it.

555
00:49:03,898 --> 00:49:05,930
Come on, Billy.
Lift it!

556
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:08,464
The engines are kicking.

557
00:49:11,797 --> 00:49:13,763
Jesus, the landing gear going down.

558
00:49:13,797 --> 00:49:15,796
Because someone is lowering it.

559
00:49:17,731 --> 00:49:19,995
I recommend abortion, sir.

560
00:49:20,564 --> 00:49:25,962
Here is Bravo-Tango-2. Wings
Starquest are swinging a lot.

561
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:29,261
Cason, let it go!

562
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:31,261
Forget it.
That's an order!

563
00:49:31,295 --> 00:49:35,294
Kitty Hawk, here is Cason NSA
you must abort. Again, it should abort!

564
00:49:47,294 --> 00:49:50,326
Climb. Climb it, climb it.

565
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:51,760
Upload it!

566
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:54,460
Let's stop!

567
00:49:54,494 --> 00:49:57,025
We will not stop!
Reduce power!

568
00:49:57,060 --> 00:50:00,059
Bring the landing gear
up!

569
00:50:01,992 --> 00:50:03,991
See those buildings?

570
00:50:36,223 --> 00:50:37,422
Come on!

571
00:50:37,457 --> 00:50:42,455
His ... great ... beautiful ... whale!

572
00:51:01,321 --> 00:51:06,319
This is Bravo-Tango-2. The Starquest
is flying straight and level.

573
00:51:13,453 --> 00:51:15,652
Mrs. President,
knows better than that.

574
00:51:15,686 --> 00:51:18,166
I know I tried to take
control of this

575
00:51:18,167 --> 00:51:21,017
plan somehow
and this will cost you.

576
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:23,017
DJ, open the door.

577
00:51:23,052 --> 00:51:25,051
Is up.

578
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:12,347
What the hell was that?!

579
00:52:12,381 --> 00:52:15,480
Find the security officer.

580
00:52:15,514 --> 00:52:18,012
Any other agent
safety, stand up.

581
00:52:23,946 --> 00:52:27,446
How about three of us give a ride?

582
00:52:34,011 --> 00:52:36,594
Mrs. President,
Secret Service reports that

583
00:52:36,595 --> 00:52:39,177
the first lady and her
children are in shelter.

584
00:52:39,212 --> 00:52:42,677
Her mother is safe. Locate
his sister. She is out of the country.

585
00:52:42,712 --> 00:52:44,677
Thank you.

586
00:52:44,712 --> 00:52:46,710
Take that.

587
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:08,741
Still no sign of
movement in the window.

588
00:53:08,775 --> 00:53:11,308
Helicopters in position
and waiting.

589
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:14,607
Tell them that they are ready
jumping up and enter.

590
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:24,840
Come on. Come on, come on!

591
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:42,372
Come before. Be ready to
come quickly to the smoke.

592
00:54:22,536 --> 00:54:25,034
Come on! Come on!

593
00:54:34,967 --> 00:54:37,800
Do not let them use
the hostages as shields.

594
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:45,666
That, my ass is that
bulletproof, bitch!

595th
00:54:57,299 --> 00:54:59,298
Clean!

596
00:54:59,799 --> 00:55:02,297
Clean! We have a runner!

597
00:55:05,465 --> 00:55:08,397
I thought I heard something funny.

598
00:55:08,432 --> 00:55:10,396
Let me see your hands.

599
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:13,896
That was me. I
to go to the bathroom.

600
00:55:13,931 --> 00:55:15,929
Ruth!

601
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:33,728
Sarco-1, the suspect is fleeing
a white cargo van.

602
00:55:33,762 --> 00:55:36,761
Go ahead and keep eye contact.

603
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:43,794
Come on!

604
00:55:51,660 --> 00:55:53,659
Damn! Damn!

605
00:56:14,658 --> 00:56:16,791
Do not shoot! I repeat, do not shoot.

606
00:56:16,825 --> 00:56:18,624
We need the target alive.

607
00:56:18,658 --> 00:56:20,540
Lord, and if he
say where hostages are

608
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,557
and tell them to be
move, or shoot them?

609
00:56:22,591 --> 00:56:25,623
Can you bring the target to a
quick stop without killing it?

610
00:56:25,657 --> 00:56:27,656
<i> Affirmative. </ i>

611
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:38,655
Dammit!

612
00:56:40,088 --> 00:56:42,087
Damn!

613
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:50,487
Oh no, not you.

614
00:56:53,019 --> 00:56:53,886
It, bring it!

615
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:10,019
Damn!

616
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:27,551
You know ... you and my ex-wife
have similar qualities.

617
00:57:27,585 --> 00:57:31,583
Perhaps when all this is done,
We can get a little bit?

618
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:36,816
"I do not have it.
-Claro.

619
00:57:47,750 --> 00:57:51,748
You have two choices.
Can open the folder or ...

620
00:57:54,416 --> 00:57:56,381
What's your choice?

621
00:57:56,416 --> 00:58:00,348
Here! Take it, right?
Take it!

622
00:58:05,581 --> 00:58:07,580
This poses a problem.

623
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,446
What we are doing
about it, Robert?

624
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:27,978
It is part of a plan that you have not had
privilege of knowing yet, Ralph.

625
00:58:32,912 --> 00:58:35,144
Make sure that
I'm not bothered.

626
00:58:45,811 --> 00:58:50,376
I said, I do not have the key!
The guy on the other side has the key!

627
00:58:50,411 --> 00:58:53,410
This may hurt a little.

628
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:00,075
Damn!

629
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,439
Bastard!

630
01:00:04,337 --> 01:00:06,603
Yes, sir, I will return.

631
01:00:06,637 --> 01:00:08,902
The guys toast.
Were burned in the disaster.

632
01:00:08,936 --> 01:00:10,902
Great.
Some good news?

633
01:00:10,936 --> 01:00:12,935
I took it from his pocket
one of the boys.

634
01:00:12,969 --> 01:00:16,393
We can get some
SIM card information.

635
01:00:16,394 --> 01:00:17,535
I have the record.

636
01:00:17,569 --> 01:00:19,702
-Where?
Point-George.

637
01:00:19,735 --> 01:00:21,734
Okay, let's go.

638
01:00:25,068 --> 01:00:27,734
The SIM card seems
still be legible.

639
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:29,768
Let's see ...

640
01:00:32,468 --> 01:00:37,016
It has a text message
posted at 9:30 this morning:

641
01:00:37,017 --> 01:00:38,533
"Delivery on the way."

642nd
01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:40,799
Locate your destination.

643
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,265
Lord, have another
message text here.

644
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:51,265
Sent soon after his fall.
Only says: "Problem."

645
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:55,299
Okay, let's hurry.
We are running out of time.

646
01:00:57,399 --> 01:01:01,930
Your current position leads to Alexandria
Virginia, directly to DC.

647
01:01:01,964 --> 01:01:07,463
If I had to bring down the plane,
where would be the best place?

648
01:01:07,498 --> 01:01:09,863
Find a safe place
Mrs. President.

649
01:01:09,898 --> 01:01:11,863
We have the Phoenix System.

650
01:01:11,897 --> 01:01:15,229
-What is it?
Laser-launched satellite.

651
01:01:15,264 --> 01:01:19,962
This is a five-megawatt laser spatial
which vaporizes the metal contact.

652
01:01:19,997 --> 01:01:24,762
Can focus on a target with precision
less than a foot in diameter.

653
01:01:24,796 --> 01:01:28,895
We had almost 90% successful
reduction targets.

654
01:01:28,929 --> 01:01:31,073
The laser detonates the
fuel in the wings,

655
01:01:31,074 --> 01:01:35,361
virtually disintegrating the
plane, leaving few traces.

656
01:01:35,396 --> 01:01:41,127
If you do, I do it in an area
uninhabited, so think of these areas.

657
01:01:41,161 --> 01:01:42,761
Yes, ma'am.

658
01:01:42,795 --> 01:01:47,593
Well, let's start organizing
the National Guard,

659
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:50,226
hospitals and service
Search and Rescue.

660
01:01:50,261 --> 01:01:52,259
Yes, Mrs. President.

661
01:02:03,159 --> 01:02:07,191
I have already said the key.

662
01:02:07,225 --> 01:02:09,317
-Stay with me.
-I do not have the key.

663
01:02:09,318 --> 01:02:11,024
-Stay with me.
-I have not.

664
01:02:11,058 --> 01:02:13,457
You can survive it.

665
01:02:13,492 --> 01:02:17,743
Marsha ... Marsha.
What are you doing?

666th
01:02:18,163 --> 01:02:19,560
What are you doing?

667
01:02:21,891 --> 01:02:24,890
Hey!
Stay with me.

668
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:26,922
Okay, okay.

669
01:03:01,554 --> 01:03:02,528
She's back.

670
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:05,452
Vitale agent, you are
back to President Franklin.

671
01:03:05,487 --> 01:03:07,452
It's the money!

672
01:03:07,487 --> 01:03:09,552
How well "the money"?

673
01:03:09,587 --> 01:03:13,218
Securities, worth of bonds.

674
01:03:13,253 --> 01:03:17,351
Vitale, we have no control
aircraft. I may have to bring him down.

675
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:21,251
Give me more time, Mrs. President. I will
try to take him down from here.

676
01:03:21,286 --> 01:03:24,185
-Do not have much time.
-I know.

677
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:27,251
Drugs.

678
01:03:27,286 --> 01:03:32,216
Mrs. President, this is a list of
SAT for special circumstances.

679
01:03:32,251 --> 01:03:37,116
His agent Vitale is on board,
security officer

680
01:03:37,117 --> 01:03:39,549
but so are two messengers.

681
01:03:39,584 --> 01:03:42,383
Let me guess ...
are moving cash.

682
01:03:42,417 --> 01:03:46,417
One hundred and fifty million
dollars in bonds.

683
01:03:52,442 --> 01:03:56,913
TJ, I want you to know
policies of the rich.

684
01:03:57,180 --> 01:04:00,138
Of course I want to download and 100 of those.

685
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:04,120
-What is going chief?
-Forget it, do what I say.

686
01:04:16,299 --> 01:04:18,278
What are you doing
out of place?

687
01:04:22,739 --> 01:04:25,765
"Who are you?
-I am a passenger.

688
01:04:44,327 --> 01:04:46,340
It is you who is causing
all these problems?

689
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:53,875
Secret Service.

690
01:04:56,206 --> 01:05:01,326
It's the nanny's sister's president,
that pretty.

691
01:05:01,444 --> 01:05:04,242
But it will be with
the family when you die.

692
01:05:06,216 --> 01:05:07,831
But I found
trunk of the family.

693
01:05:08,618 --> 01:05:14,147
"You know where my suitcase is.
"I know and you do not.

694
01:05:25,902 --> 01:05:28,974
You're just a bank robber.
It's just the money.

695
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:31,234
It's a lot of money.

696
01:05:33,643 --> 01:05:34,951
Damn ...

697
01:06:29,499 --> 01:06:31,182
And you were already dead.

698
01:06:41,844 --> 01:06:43,562
You must be kidding.

699
01:06:48,985 --> 01:06:51,317
Robert, what's the plan?

700
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:55,570
Wait, leave here in a minute.

701
01:08:05,094 --> 01:08:07,745
Stay away from the door, princess.

702
01:08:38,094 --> 01:08:39,618
ENGINE DAMAGED

703
01:08:39,962 --> 01:08:41,839
Just lost
engine power.

704
01:08:42,098 --> 01:08:43,338
Really?

705
01:08:44,567 --> 01:08:46,319
We could not have lost the engine.

706
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:58,026
If not we land
now we will fall.

707
01:09:00,249 --> 01:09:02,433
-Do it!
-Hold on, hold on.

708
01:09:05,755 --> 01:09:08,212
6, this is Bravo Tango 2.

709
01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:13,598
The charge exploded and it seems
the motor was with her.

710
01:09:16,732 --> 01:09:19,064
See any further damage,
something more superficial?

711
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:22,876
Negative, try to get close to
see the damage, but walk quickly.

712
01:09:23,272 --> 01:09:26,992
I guess I can not continue
flying more.

713
01:09:27,109 --> 01:09:29,725
Tango Bravo 2 if it was
pilot could fly this plane?

714
01:09:30,012 --> 01:09:31,718
I did not want.

715
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:35,523
Okay, let me be
clear. If you shoot,

The 716th
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:39,231
I do not think that it is in
the air for long.

717
01:09:40,622 --> 01:09:43,864
Mrs. President, reached an information
the next 60 seconds.

718
01:09:44,293 --> 01:09:46,068
Were seen six miles.

719
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:49,381
Lady?

720
01:09:52,202 --> 01:09:57,139
We can use this fire to
bring them to a controlled area?

721
01:10:01,211 --> 01:10:04,715
Mrs. President, this aircraft
was equipped with guard

722nd
01:10:04,781 --> 01:10:06,567
and a missile defense system.

723
01:10:06,783 --> 01:10:09,058
What is the chance he
keep giving it the shape?

724
01:10:09,486 --> 01:10:11,295
Currently unknown.

725
01:10:22,031 --> 01:10:28,971
Bravo-Tango-two, here is Franklin,
is authorized to bring the plane down.

726
01:10:31,207 --> 01:10:32,731
Roger, Bravo-Tango-6.

727
01:10:46,356 --> 01:10:47,698
Zorro-3, Zorro-3.

728
01:10:51,161 --> 01:10:53,026
Locked-defense system.
-What was that?

729
01:11:00,737 --> 01:11:02,944
June 2 is here, the missiles
were eliminated.

730
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:04,973
Firing again.

731
01:11:09,612 --> 01:11:11,318
The missile is moving.

732
01:11:17,820 --> 01:11:19,299
What happened?

733
01:11:20,023 --> 01:11:22,173
Bravo-Tango-two, has to abort
the mission immediately.

734
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:24,395
Understood in June, mission aborted.

735
01:11:25,995 --> 01:11:26,814
They have a laser?

736
01:11:29,499 --> 01:11:32,104
-How far are?
-They are coming.

737
01:11:32,835 --> 01:11:35,235
Get me the White House.

738
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:38,310
Yes, Madam.

739
01:11:50,920 --> 01:11:53,741
We gotta go.
Come on.

740
01:12:00,663 --> 01:12:02,824
Come on, come on.

741
01:12:08,805 --> 01:12:10,727
President, we
waiting for their orders.

742
01:12:11,207 --> 01:12:12,253
Proceed.

743
01:12:23,519 --> 01:12:25,157
Pro floor to the ground!

744
01:12:34,297 --> 01:12:35,787
Do not mess ...

745
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:45,291
We are not stabilized,
're falling.

746th
01:13:00,089 --> 01:13:01,920
6, here is 2, Bravo-Tango-1
just explode.

747
01:13:02,558 --> 01:13:04,492
The laser-worked.
-Are you listening?

748
01:13:04,761 --> 01:13:06,752
"No pro airplane.
-What happened?

749
01:13:06,963 --> 01:13:09,784
-What happened?
Tango-Bravo 2, continue.

750
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:13,165
Shot him.

751
01:13:20,543 --> 01:13:22,682
-Turn off it, unplug it!
Turn off-the laser.

752
01:13:40,496 --> 01:13:41,986
She can not die.

753
01:13:42,932 --> 01:13:46,424
There is nothing to descend.
Fly without the engine.

754
01:13:47,937 --> 01:13:50,826
-Damn!
-Over, okay?

755
01:13:51,941 --> 01:13:54,546
Let me get off the plane to which
these people do not have to die.

756
01:13:54,811 --> 01:13:57,917
-Let me think.
-Does not have to think about anything.

757
01:13:58,281 --> 01:14:00,727
It takes just 5 minutes to land
and nobody will give a hero.

758
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:06,719
Guys, we ran out of time.

759
01:14:06,923 --> 01:14:08,572
Do something, do it!

760
01:14:12,695 --> 01:14:14,526
What's the plan?

761
01:14:16,866 --> 01:14:19,357
-I will talk with my brother.
-All right.

762
01:14:26,676 --> 01:14:32,148
-Me, Joe.
-I am a little busy now.

763
01:14:32,548 --> 01:14:34,482
Do not want to be thick but
can go straight to the point,

764
01:14:34,684 --> 01:14:35,787
I appreciate it.

765
01:14:36,152 --> 01:14:39,041
Remember when we fish the bay?

766
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:43,720
-What beautiful memories.
-Thanks.

767
01:14:47,063 --> 01:14:48,610
See you there.

768
01:14:51,067 --> 01:14:57,700
This nonsense will not happen
and my brothers will not be released.

769
01:14:57,840 --> 01:15:00,593
All-or hurt themselves.
-Sure, DC will not accept it.

770
01:15:00,910 --> 01:15:04,289
Well, put the table,
we arrived for dinner.

771
01:15:06,015 --> 01:15:08,722
-Hey, that's my sister.
-Fuck your sister.

772
01:15:08,851 --> 01:15:12,730
-The search continues ...
-I do not believe they shot the plane.

773
01:15:12,889 --> 01:15:17,167
-We have reports that ...
"You know what that means.

774
01:15:31,274 --> 01:15:32,445
Sorry, lady.

775
01:15:33,276 --> 01:15:35,141
Sorry. I pity you,
soon as we begin to know ourselves.

776
01:15:43,052 --> 01:15:44,155
Do not move.

777
01:15:48,057 --> 01:15:50,036
3 hostages got down here
and I'll kill them all!

778
01:15:55,765 --> 01:15:57,016
FBI, right?

779
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:11,229
Not the loss, I can not
keep this plane.

780
01:16:11,848 --> 01:16:13,213
Is dropping.

781
01:16:30,266 --> 01:16:31,745
Can I fly a plane alone.

782
01:16:37,106 --> 01:16:38,949
Okay?

783
01:16:43,246 --> 01:16:44,406
I lost GPS.

784
01:16:45,314 --> 01:16:48,283
-They are very bad?
We flew blind, and nearly out of fuel.

785
01:16:57,393 --> 01:16:59,714
Mrs. President, the plane is
DC airspace.

786
01:17:00,263 --> 01:17:03,016
President, I have two
waiting in line.

787
01:17:03,366 --> 01:17:07,109
-Joe.
'We have control of the airplane again.

788
01:17:07,336 --> 01:17:11,340
Actually we do not need because we have
map, satellite or anything else.

789
01:17:11,774 --> 01:17:14,220
But ... we landed in Dallas.

790
01:17:15,545 --> 01:17:19,345
-Sure, and your family is safe.
Thanks, Harriet.

791
01:17:22,852 --> 01:17:24,558
We lost communication.

792
01:17:32,762 --> 01:17:33,911
Are you okay?

793
01:17:36,532 --> 01:17:41,583
Yes I am better than Ben, lodge
this baby and get back home.

794
01:17:42,305 --> 01:17:44,671
-How?
The old-fashioned.

795
01:17:45,541 --> 01:17:48,248
Let's take it and plant it on the track.

796
01:17:48,644 --> 01:17:50,851
Navigate the brands.

797
01:17:53,049 --> 01:17:55,768
Gina was very kind to me
say what you see there.

798
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:01,502
The Lincoln Memorial at 2:00
approximately 3 km.

799
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:06,945
The Washington Monument
11.00, five kilometers.

800
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:17,444
That, slowly, slowly.

801
01:18:19,175 --> 01:18:21,200
Let's try the next port.

802
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:29,131
We can not give back
these conditions.

803
01:18:29,719 --> 01:18:32,654
Your browser does not work
levels are not certain.

804
01:18:32,888 --> 01:18:35,038
Never be able to land this thing,
we can not keep it that way.

805
01:18:35,124 --> 01:18:37,968
Sure. Gina, I can
give a glass of water.

806
01:18:38,394 --> 01:18:39,998
By half, please.

807
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,834
All right, brother?

808
01:18:48,037 --> 01:18:49,379
We hope so.

809
01:18:53,242 --> 01:18:54,345
Thank you.

810
01:18:54,777 --> 01:18:56,142
Capital right, 1:00.

811
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,379
National Park
left side. 09:00.

812
01:19:09,659 --> 01:19:11,581
-The wheels are falling.
-You have to give me good news.

813
01:19:13,562 --> 01:19:16,474
Joe can not land this plane.

814
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:19,264
We're running out of fuel.
Never succeed.

815
01:19:28,611 --> 01:19:32,354
Gina, I think it would be
a good idea to sit down.

816
01:19:38,287 --> 01:19:42,030
Never succeed.
Between this and the street prostitutes,

817
01:19:42,291 --> 01:19:45,158
the only thing that keeps me
trying to land this plane.

818
01:19:57,940 --> 01:19:59,726
They're going straight to
building capital.

819
01:24:12,194 --> 01:24:16,028
I was so scared.
Are you okay?

820
01:24:16,432 --> 01:24:17,774
Yes.

821
01:24:20,936 --> 01:24:22,801
Hey buddy.

822
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:27,896
Do not you ever fly again.
