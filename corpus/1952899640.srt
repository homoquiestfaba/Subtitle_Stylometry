00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:38,209
Oh god!

2
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:42,013
Help!

3
00:05:41,401 --> 00:05:43,728
Losing my fucking mind.

4
00:06:44,464 --> 00:06:47,795
Fuck you!
Come one.

5
00:13:02,942 --> 00:13:04,942
Ah, fuck!

6
00:13:39,245 --> 00:13:41,805
Fuck it, fuck it, fuck!

7
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:46,709
Fucking shit!
Fuck it!

8
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:49,086
God!

9
00:13:50,757 --> 00:13:53,457
Come on!

10
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,871
Come on.

11
00:16:04,524 --> 00:16:07,554
Are we friends, George?

12
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:20,839
What the hell are we doing here?

13
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,550
Shit!

14
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,666
Here!

15
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:17,901
Here!

16
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,268
Hi! Hi!

17
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:31,746
I can't believe it!
Come here. Oh, god!

18
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:33,618
Oh, god!

19
00:21:33,619 --> 00:21:35,646
Hey...
Oh, god!

20
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:39,010
Hey, come here.

21
00:21:42,828 --> 00:21:44,828
Thank... thank you.

22
00:21:46,665 --> 00:21:49,998
So warm... so warm... so warm...,

23
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:53,971
Get the...

24
00:21:53,972 --> 00:21:56,974
Wait, wait, wait. Calm down,
I'll get you out of here.

25
00:21:56,975 --> 00:21:58,975
Calm down.
Get this open, please.

26
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:02,139
Water, water.

27
00:22:02,481 --> 00:22:04,481
Water.

28
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,125
Water.

29
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:21,099
Are you hungry?

30
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:23,261
Do you want this?

31
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:21,892
It's ok.

32
00:23:29,435 --> 00:23:32,435
Hey, it's ok.

33
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:37,240
Everything's gonna be alright now.

34
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:39,743
I promise.

35
00:25:07,899 --> 00:25:09,899
What the fuck?

36
00:25:25,851 --> 00:25:27,978
Get away from him!

37
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:32,883
You hear me?
Get away from him!

38
00:25:33,091 --> 00:25:35,091
Get out of there!

39
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,923
Get out of there! I'm warning you!
You stop that! You st..,.

40
00:25:56,448 --> 00:25:58,448
That's right.

41
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:05,955
I told him.

42
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,994
I warned him.

43
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,332
What the fuck is this?

44
00:28:39,211 --> 00:28:41,211
Fuck it!

45
00:28:45,150 --> 00:28:47,150
Let me out of here!

46
00:28:47,385 --> 00:28:49,385
Oh, god!

47
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,554
Fuck this!

48
00:29:05,103 --> 00:29:07,103
Come!

49
00:29:16,848 --> 00:29:19,045
Fuck, open! Fuck!

Fuck!

51
00:29:26,958 --> 00:29:29,153
You son of a bitch!

52
00:29:40,438 --> 00:29:42,633
Oh, fuck me!

53
00:29:55,053 --> 00:29:57,053
Oh, god!

00:31:16,968 --> 00:31:18,968
I'm here.

57
00:31:26,144 --> 00:31:28,144
Help me!

58
00:32:31,776 --> 00:32:33,776
Help, fuck!

59
00:33:20,558 --> 00:33:22,822
Who's Raymond Plazzy?

60
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:25,628
You.

61
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:32,435
Raymond.

62
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:40,977
Hello.

63
00:33:41,045 --> 00:33:43,045
My name is Raymond.

64
00:34:36,935 --> 00:34:38,704
<i>Police have identified three men</i>

65

you're fucked.

72
00:36:53,605 --> 00:36:56,574

Help me!

79
00:38:09,914 --> 00:38:11,914
Who the fuck are you?

80
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:16,952
My leg.

81
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,088
Please.

82
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:24,085

Hey! Hey, wait! Hey!

85
00:38:40,411 --> 00:38:42,411
Oh, god!

86
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:57,620
Hey, dog.

What are you doing out here?

90
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:22,170
You're a good dog?

91
00:40:24,315 --> 00:40:26,315
You're a bad dog?

92
00:41:25,977 --> 00:41:27,977
I hate mint!

93
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:49,959
I had a dog when I was a kid.

94
00:41:54,005 --> 00:41:56,132
He had a name.

95
00:41:59,477 --> 00:42:01,477
Duke.

96
00:44:43,107 --> 00:44:45,107
Oh, god!

97
00:46:23,974 --> 00:46:25,574
Can't stop now.

Stop!

107
00:48:17,154 --> 00:48:19,154
Fuck!

108
00:49:08,972 --> 00:49:10,972
Shit!

109
00:49:16,346 --> 00:49:18,546
Anybody out there, boy?
Ha?

110
00:49:45,809 --> 00:49:47,809
Oh, fuck!

114
00:50:37,594 --> 00:50:42,122
Little, little, yeah.
Little, little, quick.

115
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:44,900
Yeah.

116
00:52:30,974 --> 00:52:32,474
Fuck you!

117
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:04,878
You're a crazy dog.

118
00:56:06,422 --> 00:56:08,422
Go get it.

119
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:12,094
Good boy!
Bring it here.

120
00:56:12,099 --> 00:56:15,502
Oh, good boy! Oh, good boy!
Good boy! Oh, good boy!

121
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,428
Where is the stick?
Where is the stick?

122
00:56:25,407 --> 00:56:26,108
Ah, get it!

123
00:56:26,909 --> 00:56:27,810
Get it!

124
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:29,411
Chicken!

125
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:31,199
You chicken!

126
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:34,778
Come on! Come on, chicken!
Come here!

127
00:56:35,585 --> 00:56:37,219
You're a chicken.

128
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:40,720
You're a good boy.
Good boy.

129
01:00:50,806 --> 01:00:52,006
Hello?

130
01:01:36,152 --> 01:01:37,552
Come and get me!

131
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,290
Come and get me!

132
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,453
I don't care!

133
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:52,799
I don't care!

134
01:02:18,994 --> 01:02:20,195
What?

135
01:02:20,796 --> 01:02:21,930
What?

136
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:23,999
What do you want?

137
01:02:24,100 --> 01:02:26,967
Go!
What is it?

138
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:25,518
No! What?

139
01:04:32,928 --> 01:04:34,428
What?

140
01:04:43,205 --> 01:04:44,605
No!

141
01:04:55,417 --> 01:04:56,817
No!

142
01:05:08,931 --> 01:05:10,431
What?

143
01:05:16,939 --> 01:05:18,339
What?

144
01:05:29,818 --> 01:05:31,953
No, no.

145
01:06:12,361 --> 01:06:14,286
Fuck you.

146
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,127
Move the fuck away from me!

147
01:06:20,969 --> 01:06:21,903
Move the fuck away!

148
01:06:22,704 --> 01:06:24,868
I know what you're trying to do.

149
01:06:26,975 --> 01:06:28,509
I don't want you here!

150
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:30,010
I don't want you here!

151
01:06:30,879 --> 01:06:31,980
I don't want you here!

152
01:06:32,281 --> 01:06:33,981
I know.

153
01:06:39,421 --> 01:06:40,721
You did this!

154
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,858
You didn't think I would do it?

155
01:06:45,928 --> 01:06:47,228
Well I did.

156
01:06:47,729 --> 01:06:49,859
I did.

157
01:06:49,999 --> 01:06:51,499
No.

158
01:11:19,582 --> 01:11:21,945
There's no road.

159
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:36,620
Stupid.

160
01:11:37,536 --> 01:11:39,536
Yeah, I told you it was a stupid idea.

161
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:43,605
Fucking stupid.

162
01:11:46,706 --> 01:11:48,906
Keep talking, yeah.

163
01:11:48,710 --> 01:11:50,910
Keep talking.

164
01:12:02,458 --> 01:12:04,158
Shut the fuck up!

165
01:12:08,598 --> 01:12:10,798
That's what I thought.

166
01:19:26,568 --> 01:19:28,638
Cause we've had this conversation already.
- Why? Yeah, I know we've had.

167
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:31,040
We've had that conversation like...
- Oh, god! Well you just get...

168
01:19:31,049 --> 01:19:33,640
What do you want?
You gotta do things like that, I mean...

169
01:19:42,818 --> 01:19:44,718
Absolutely not.

170
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,283
Let's go!
- Out of the fucking way!

171
01:20:14,018 --> 01:20:15,417
Let's go, guys!

172
01:20:15,418 --> 01:20:17,518
Gotta go! Come on! Let's go!
- What? What are you doing?

173
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:19,789
No!
- Oh, my god!

174
01:20:19,799 --> 01:20:22,089
Shit! What the fuck is this?

175
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:24,093
Who the fuck is this?

176
01:20:24,128 --> 01:20:27,126
Come on, go!
What the fuck is wrong with you?

177
01:20:27,527 --> 01:20:27,995
Go!

178
01:20:28,096 --> 01:20:30,064
Oh, my god! Simon!

179
01:20:30,065 --> 01:20:32,333
Left here! Go left!
I got it, I got it!

180
01:20:32,399 --> 01:20:33,367
This wasn't fucking planned!

181
01:20:33,468 --> 01:20:34,504
You shot the fucking guy!

182
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:35,905
Calm down, guys!

183
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:48,801
The dog.
- What?

184
01:22:50,105 --> 01:22:51,805
My dog.

185
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,450
There's no dog.

186
01:23:27,009 --> 01:23:28,909
You ok?
