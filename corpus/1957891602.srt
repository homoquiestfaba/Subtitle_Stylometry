1
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:34,234
Don't think about it,
just jump!

2
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:37,572
-Don't tell me
not to think about it!

3
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:40,374
-Don't think. Jump!

4
00:00:40,474 --> 00:00:42,109
-What's this thing gonna do?

5
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:45,145
-Uh, it's gonna follow along
as you do. Now go!

6
00:00:47,715 --> 00:00:49,049
-Okay.

7
00:00:51,853 --> 00:00:53,521
Oooh!

8
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:57,291
-Aww, nice!
Guys, check this out.

9
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:59,326
It's a pretty nice tracking
shot, don't you think?

10
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:00,929
- Pretty good.
- I like it. I think, uh,

11
00:01:01,029 --> 00:01:02,262
I think we could do
a little bit better.

12
00:01:02,362 --> 00:01:03,831
Im'ma be honest,
David could do some

13
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:05,733
Hey, that was,
that was, uh, good

14
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,035
but the next one
could be better.

15
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,670
So, get back up there
and do something different

16
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:09,904
like a flip or like

17
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:11,005
-I'll start
taking your directions

18
00:01:11,104 --> 00:01:12,205
when you actually
get in the water.

19
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:15,409
-Dude, I'm the cameraman.
I can't get wet.

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,844
How much was the drone?

21
00:01:16,945 --> 00:01:18,746
-Millie here was 800 bucks.
But I still owe 500 dollars.

22
00:01:18,846 --> 00:01:20,782
-Millie?

23
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:21,950
-Millennium Falcon.

24
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,116
-You're kidding.

25
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:24,752
-I'm not.

26
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:26,320
-Dude, you can make 500 bucks

27
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,188
at the speech competition
at school.

28
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:29,557
-Huh, I'm a video blogger.

29
00:01:29,657 --> 00:01:31,759
I don't do live speeches
to impress small crowds.

30
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,962
-You don't do speeches
to impress any crowds.

31
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:36,163
-Look, all right, this next
one's gotta go viral, okay?

32
00:01:36,263 --> 00:01:37,599
- Okay.
- So I need somebody

33
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,300
do a belly flop off the cliff, and I nee

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,736
David, how about you?

35
00:01:41,836 --> 00:01:43,638
-Dude, I'm already
starting to get a headache.

36
00:01:43,738 --> 00:01:45,205
Um I tell you what,

37
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:46,507
how about you get a shot
of all three of us

38
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:48,141
jumping at the same time?
How's that sound?

39
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,011
-All right, all right.
That, that'll work.

40
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
All right,
get back over there,

41
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:53,447
let me get Millie
all situated here.

42
00:01:54,214 --> 00:01:56,784
All right, Millie,
let's do this.

43
00:01:58,686 --> 00:02:00,521
Are you guys set?

44
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:01,656
-Ready?

45
00:02:03,658 --> 00:02:08,830
-All right, here we go.
Three, two, one

46
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,802
-Ha-ha-ha! Sweet!

47
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:18,171
No! No, no, I wasn't rolling.

48
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,907
Ah, guys, can we do that again?

49
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:22,777
Let's pick it back up
from the top.

54
00:02:36,024 --> 00:02:37,357
- Okay.
- Oh, wait.

55
00:02:37,457 --> 00:02:39,292
We want you to guess.

56
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,695
It's not French fries.

57
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:42,730
-Mm, let me see.

58
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:45,900
It's a new phone.

59
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,635
-No, it's not a trombone.

60
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:49,469
Trombone wouldn't fit
in that little bag.

61
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,706
-No, sweetie,
that's not what he said.

62
00:02:51,806 --> 00:02:53,941
-He doesn't even play
the trombone.

63
00:02:54,042 --> 00:02:55,777
-It's true.
-You're right.

64
00:02:55,877 --> 00:02:58,146

We all pitched in.

-Train tickets? No way!

67
00:03:09,123 --> 00:03:10,725
-You've always
loved trains, so

68
00:03:10,825 --> 00:03:13,561
-They're good for a round trip anywhere

69
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:17,330
-Sweet! Thank you.
Thank you, this is awesome!

70
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,499
-So, you know, maybe a trip
this summer before college?

71
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,936
-Just not during
our camping trip.

72
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:23,236
-I wouldn't miss that
for the world.

73
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:27,108
-David, what are your plans
after you graduate?

74
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,275
-You know,
the wrestling championship's

75
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:31,779
coming up and uh,
if all goes well

76
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,246
-It will.

77
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,651
-I mean, I heard
that there's scouts coming.

78
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:37,919
You know, I'm not sure
if I'm good enough

79
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,187
for a scholarship but

80
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,090
-Listen, scholarship
or no scholarship,

81
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,424
we will make sure
you can go to college.

82
00:03:44,525 --> 00:03:45,993
-You know, if it,
if it doesn't work out,

83
00:03:46,094 --> 00:03:48,996
I can always join Nate and
get famous making online videos.

84
00:03:49,097 --> 00:03:50,497
-Where is Nate?
I thought he was coming.

85
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:52,600
-I don't know. He said
he was gonna try and make it.

86
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,802
-God has something
special for you, David.

87
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:56,269
I'm sure of that.

88
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,370
-I'm pretty sure
that's just something

89
00:03:57,471 --> 00:04:00,708
that parents like to say.

90
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:02,977

You okay?

101
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:15,616
-Today is David's 18th birthday.

102
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,350
-Oh, wow.

103
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:22,590
Does that mean you guys
can talk now?

104
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:24,258
-Well, he's legally old enough
to reach out to me,

105
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,093
if he wants to.

106
00:05:29,096 --> 00:05:30,731
-Would he know how?

107
00:05:30,832 --> 00:05:31,999
-Shawn, I haven't
updated my records

108
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:38,005
since he was a baby.
Then I moved, married you.

109
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:40,675
-You wanna talk to him?

110
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:44,178
-I don't think
he'd want to talk to me.

111
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:46,413
Probably hates me
for what I did.

112
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:54,822
-Well, there's only one way
to find out.

113
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,530
-Dude, I swear
I was gonna be there.

114
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,232
But my sister got in this epic
fight with her boyfriend,

115
00:06:04,332 --> 00:06:05,633
I had to film it
from the window.

116
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:07,702
It went on and on,
and I couldn't leave.

117
00:06:07,802 --> 00:06:08,502
-You filmed it?

118
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:09,537
-Yeah, she doesn't know that,

119
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,838
but I'm editing it
for my channel.

120
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,007
-No! No, you can't
do that, Nate.

121
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:14,407
-Okay, I might let her see it.

122
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,676
But she was throwing
bricks at his car.

123
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,711
What was I supposed to do?

124
00:06:16,811 --> 00:06:17,912
She hit it twice,
you know, I'm

125
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:20,214
-Oh, David. Can I speak
with you for a second?

126
00:06:20,314 --> 00:06:21,414
-Ooh.
-So

127
00:06:21,515 --> 00:06:23,618
Just David. Nate,
you can head to class.

128
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:25,920
-Well, is it important,
'cause I kinda wanna hear.

129
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,188
-Nate.

130
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:28,522
-Okay, all right, cool.
I'm just saying,

131
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:31,525
he's gonna tell me as soon as
he leaves the room, so

132
00:06:33,995 --> 00:06:37,298
-Look, I want you to think
about something, all right?

133
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,333
I'm overseeing
the speech competition,

134
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:42,670
and I think you should
consider entering.

135
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,605
-Um, why?

136
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:47,575
I mean, I'm not really good
in front of crowds.

137
00:06:47,675 --> 00:06:48,910
-Well, two reasons, you know.

138
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:51,145
Your classmates got a lot of
respect for you, okay?

139
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,349
And I think you can speak on
a theme that we've been given.

140
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:57,518
-What's that?

141
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,788
-The value of family.

142
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,390
-You mean,
because I'm adopted.

143
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,825
-And that's an important
perspective, right?

144
00:07:04,926 --> 00:07:07,862
So far, no one's
focusing on that.

145
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,197
-Yeah, but I mean,

146
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:11,431
not a lot of people know
that I'm

147
00:07:11,532 --> 00:07:12,800
-I, I know.

148
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,102
I just believe that you could
do a great job, okay?

149
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,104
And there's even a cash prize.

150
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:18,773
-Yeah, no,
I heard about that.

151
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:22,009
-Hey, look,
just think about it. Okay?

152
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:23,344
-All right.

153
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,280
-All right. Up top.

154
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,381
Get to class.

155
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,950
-All right.
-All right.

156
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,651
-Nate makes bids, and

157
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:32,520
Um, hey, can you
hang on just a second?

158
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,088
Dude! Dude, dude, dude,

159
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:36,190
okay, I know I'm not
supposed to know everything

160
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:37,457
but tell me everything.

161
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:38,826
-No, it's nothing.

162
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,795
It's just about
the speech competition.

163
00:07:40,895 --> 00:07:43,965
-Oh, why did he wanna
talk to you about that?

164
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,067
-Got another headache?

165
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,768
-Yeah. Yeah, I'm sick of them.

166
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:48,970
-Yeah, dude,
I'm telling you,

167
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:49,937
it's the science lab.

168
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:51,238
That thing smells
like death on a cracker.

169
00:07:51,339 --> 00:07:52,239
-Yeah.

170
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,809
-Hey, Emily, what's up?

171
00:07:54,909 --> 00:07:56,310
-It's Elizabeth.

172
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,879
-What? Dude,
I was gonna ask her to prom.

173
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,848
-Ooh, how about
learning her name first?

174
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:07,054
Careful, watch the throw.

175
00:08:13,394 --> 00:08:14,562
-You've got this, David.

176
00:08:14,662 --> 00:08:16,263
Watch his shoulder!
He's coming again!

177
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:20,167
Get the knee up, David.
Get your knee up.

178
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,302
Yes, yes.
- Come on!

179
00:08:21,402 --> 00:08:23,170
Flip him, flip him.
Yes. Yes!

180
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,238
Now pin him.

181
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,374
Hold him! Hold him!

182
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,942
Yes!

183
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:30,444
Yeah! Yes!

184
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,714
-That's my boy right there!
Whoo-hoo!

185
00:08:40,454 --> 00:08:43,691
David, David, David!

186
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,635
-David, that's so awesome!

187
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:56,570
-David, you told me
he was gonna take you.

188
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,972
-I've never beaten him before.

189
00:08:58,072 --> 00:08:59,173
-That was awesome.

190
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,609
-Dude, this is the best moment
of your entire life.

191
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,577
-How do you say
we go out to dinner?

192
00:09:03,677 --> 00:09:05,112
You pick the place,
and we celebrate?

193
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:07,081
-Oh, yes.
-Yes.

194
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:09,083
-Guys, I

195
00:09:09,183 --> 00:09:10,785
-Okay, so tell our fans
how you're feeling.

196
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:13,754
You just won a big match
and you're feeling great

197
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:14,822
David?
- Oh, my God!

198
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:15,890
- David!
- David?

199
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,061
David! Help!
Somebody

200
00:09:28,903 --> 00:09:30,404
So, do you have
any medical conditions

201
00:09:30,505 --> 00:09:32,606
in your family history?

202
00:09:32,706 --> 00:09:34,775
-Well, David is adopted.

203
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,943
-I see.

204
00:09:36,043 --> 00:09:39,113
-And we don't have much
medical information about them.

205
00:09:39,213 --> 00:09:40,748
-I understand.

206
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:42,716
Well, what we're
dealing with here

207
00:09:42,817 --> 00:09:44,819
is excessive pressure
on the brain.

208
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,688
It's called Chiari malformation,

209
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:50,958
where part of the skull
pushes on the brain

210
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:54,395
and forces the tissue
into the spinal canal.

211
00:09:54,495 --> 00:09:57,198
It's congenital.
It develops as you grow.

212
00:09:57,298 --> 00:10:01,368
That's why your headaches
have been getting worse.

213
00:10:01,469 --> 00:10:02,670
Really,
what you need to know is,

214
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:05,540
it won't go away
unless we open it up

215
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,942
and relieve the pressure.

216
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,643
-Open it up?

217
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,946
-Um

218
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:15,116
How much, how much time
do we have to make a decision?

219
00:10:15,216 --> 00:10:17,151
-I don't think
we need to wait any longer.

220
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:20,988
We have everything ready
for surgery tomorrow morning.

221
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:30,664
-Um
What, what are the risks?

222
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:34,635
-If I were you, I'd do it
before it gets any worse.

223
00:10:40,407 --> 00:10:44,912
-David, you okay with surgery?

224
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,214
-I can't take
these headaches anymore.

225
00:10:47,314 --> 00:10:50,519
-If all goes well,
and I believe it will,

226
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:52,353
then you won't have to.

227
00:10:54,321 --> 00:11:00,461
Well, I'll let my team
know then. All right.

228
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:01,896
-Thank you.

229
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:12,439
Hey, this is all
going to work out.

230
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,208
God knew this was
going to happen.

231
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:16,545
-I know. But like,

232
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:19,713
why is He letting this
happen to me?

233
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:22,116
I mean, Dad, my team
is counting on me

234
00:11:22,216 --> 00:11:25,620
to compete in the finals,
and what about college?

235
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:27,589
Honey, I'm so sorry.

236
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,257
If I could, I would
make it all go away.

237
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:32,326
-I just don't understand.

238
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:37,131
-You know what?
I was angry with God

239
00:11:37,231 --> 00:11:42,236
for a long time after
John and Michael died.

240
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:47,875
But, if that hadn't happened,
I wouldn't have had you.

241
00:11:47,975 --> 00:11:51,912
And I cannot imagine my life
without you in it.

242
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:58,687
-David, you're strong,
and you're gonna be fine,

243
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,288
with or without wrestling.

244
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,877
-John would be three now.

245
00:12:56,977 --> 00:12:59,146
Michael would be five.

246
00:13:12,727 --> 00:13:14,428
What if we contacted
the adoption agency

247
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:16,196
one more time?

248
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,200
-I know I should be happy

249
00:13:20,301 --> 00:13:22,970
when a birth mom changes
her mind and keeps her baby.

250
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,438
But

251
00:13:25,906 --> 00:13:28,142
my heart just
can't take it again.

252
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm sorry.

253
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,088
-I understand.

254
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,500
-Hey.

255
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:58,205
-Hi. I can't go home.

256
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,074
-I know. I know.

257
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,210
You stay here.
I'll go home and get our stuff.

258
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:07,281
-Are we doing the right thing?

259
00:14:07,381 --> 00:14:09,751
-Yes. Yes.

260
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,723
-Okay. Okay.

261
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:16,524
-He is gonna be all right.

262
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:24,699
- Okay. Okay.

263
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:29,504
-All right.
I'll be right back.

264
00:14:29,604 --> 00:14:30,638
-Okay.

265
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,998
-There's the man,
the legend.

266
00:14:58,098 --> 00:14:59,667
How are you feeling,
Captain America?

267
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,902
-Hey, buddy.
Feeling pretty weak.

268
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:03,505
-Hey, you know,
Cap was weak and puny

269
00:15:03,605 --> 00:15:06,273
before he transformed.

270
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,610
-How's our superhero feeling?

271
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,011
-I am, I'm no superhero.

272
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,146
-Can I help you?

273
00:15:12,246 --> 00:15:13,581
-Oh, yeah, can I get
some more of this?

274
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:14,982
-Are you family?

275
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,284
-Oh, I'm more than family.

276
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:19,754
- Hi, you're awake!
- Hi, Mom.

277
00:15:19,854 --> 00:15:21,021
They can vouch for me.

278
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,157
-We've never seen this man
in our entire life.

279
00:15:23,257 --> 00:15:24,491
-Hey!

280
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:25,627
-He's fine.

281
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:27,194
Just keep security nearby.

282
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,696
-Well, David's doing great.

283
00:15:28,797 --> 00:15:30,998
I'll, uh, be back in a few
minutes to change his meds.

284
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,534
Thank you.

285
00:15:32,634 --> 00:15:34,234
-Hey, we brought pasta!

286
00:15:34,334 --> 00:15:35,436
- Oh, I love pasta.
- Thank you,

287
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:37,204
thank you, thank you.

288
00:15:38,506 --> 00:15:39,808
-Hi.
-Hey.

289
00:15:39,908 --> 00:15:40,842
-How're you feeling?

290
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:42,176
-I'm good.

291
00:15:44,311 --> 00:15:46,246
-Well, we talked
to the doctors.

292
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:49,183
And they relieved the pressure,

293
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:53,521
and he said that you shouldn't have any

294
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:54,622
-Okay. Thanks, God.

295
00:15:54,722 --> 00:15:57,725
-Yeah, a lot of people
have been praying for you.

296
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,129
-Hey

297
00:16:03,898 --> 00:16:05,700
the doctor also said

298
00:16:08,135 --> 00:16:10,404
no more wrestling.

299
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:11,539
-What?

300
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:17,044
Ever?

301
00:16:17,144 --> 00:16:19,379
-I'm so sorry, sweetheart.

302
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:22,149
-Hey

303
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:25,118
God got you through this.

304
00:16:25,219 --> 00:16:27,321
That's not a little thing.

305
00:16:28,288 --> 00:16:30,558
I don't think we should
take that for granted.

306
00:16:30,658 --> 00:16:32,059
-Honey.

307
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:44,438
No way.

308
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:45,640
It was just
the anesthesia talking.

309
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,140
I don't remember
saying any of that.

310
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:48,141
Oh, you weren't
just talking.

311
00:16:48,242 --> 00:16:50,010
You were singing your heart out.

312
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,113
No. Dad,
was I seriously singing?

313
00:16:53,213 --> 00:16:55,382
-Hey, guys,
listen to this.

314
00:16:55,482 --> 00:16:57,117
<i>Hello, Mr. Colton.</i>

315
00:16:57,217 --> 00:16:59,721
<i>This is Abagail</i>
<i>over at Kirsh & Clark.</i>

316
00:16:59,821 --> 00:17:02,857
<i>I just wanted to call and</i>
<i>inform you that Melissa Cates,</i>

317
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,559
<i>David's birth mother,</i>

318
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,093
<i>has updated her records.</i>

319
00:17:06,193 --> 00:17:07,695
<i>Now that David is of legal age,</i>

320
00:17:07,795 --> 00:17:10,264
<i>he has the right</i>
<i>to contact his birth parents</i>

321
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:11,799
<i>if he is interested.</i>

322
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:15,202
<i>You're welcome to call back</i>
<i>if you'd like more information.</i>

323
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:18,673
<i>Feel free to let us know,</i>
<i>and have a great day.</i>

324
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:21,976
-Wow.
I, um, she's right.

325
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:24,012
You're old enough now.

326
00:17:24,111 --> 00:17:26,581
-David, what do you think?

327
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:27,715
-I don't know.

328
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:30,685
-We need to
talk about this.

329
00:17:30,785 --> 00:17:33,021
I mean, do you think you might
wanna meet your birth mom?

330
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:35,623
-I don't know, okay?
It's a lot to think about.

331
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,692
-Yeah. Well, you don't have to do anythi

332
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:38,860
It's okay.

333
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,262
-Dad, I don't even know
if I want her back in my life.

334
00:17:43,831 --> 00:17:47,301
I don't even know her.
I mean, so is meeting her--

335
00:17:47,401 --> 00:17:49,704
-Yeah, I, I'm, I'm not
pushing you to do that, honey.

336
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,338
-No, no, there's no,
there's no rush at all.

337
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,074
Just because she called
doesn't mean we have to

338
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,877
We have time.
We have time to decide,

339
00:17:55,977 --> 00:17:57,545
we're not gonna
jump into the van

340
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,546
and go meet her.

341
00:17:58,646 --> 00:17:59,379
-That's right.

342
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,582
But you know what
I was thinking?

343
00:18:00,682 --> 00:18:04,686
We might want to respond
in some way, right?

344
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:07,421
So maybe a letter for an update?

345
00:18:08,957 --> 00:18:10,858
-Okay. I mean, fine.

346
00:18:10,959 --> 00:18:13,360
You can send her one
if you want to.

347
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:17,264
I'm gonna shower
and go to bed.

348
00:18:17,364 --> 00:18:18,700
-Still no headaches, right?

349
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,968
No headaches.

350
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:21,301
-Great.

351
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,674
We cannot rush him.

352
00:18:26,774 --> 00:18:29,242
-I know, I'm sorry.

353
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,012
But I got to thinking.

354
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:33,081
You know,
wouldn't it be kinda cool

355
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,018
for her to see him
all grown up? You know?

356
00:18:37,117 --> 00:18:39,887
I mean, she took
a really big risk on us.

357
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:43,024
-Yeah.
-She'd be so proud of him.

358
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,358
-She would be.

359
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,629
-Yeah. Yeah.

360
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,239
-Um, I'm gonna go to the store.

361
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,009
I, I gotta get some diapers

362
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:04,712
and some wipes
and couple other things.

363
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:10,118
Um, for the Millers'
baby shower.

364
00:19:10,217 --> 00:19:11,853
-Oh.
-On Saturday.

365
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,724
Um

366
00:19:18,092 --> 00:19:19,493
it kinda reminds me.

367
00:19:19,594 --> 00:19:25,298
Uh, they don't have a crib yet,
and I was thinking, you know,

368
00:19:25,399 --> 00:19:29,103
that maybe we could
give them ours?

369
00:19:39,947 --> 00:19:41,949
Can we take a little time
to think about that?

370
00:19:44,152 --> 00:19:45,520
-Uh, of course.

371
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,488
Yeah, because uh, I would only
want to do that, you know,

372
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:52,060
if you wanted to do that, so

373
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,194
Okay, I'm gonna go to the store.

374
00:19:54,294 --> 00:19:58,800
And um, thank you
for doing the dishes.

375
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:02,136
-Love you.

376
00:20:02,235 --> 00:20:03,538
I love you.

377
00:20:34,301 --> 00:20:36,671
-Yes, uh, my name
is Jimmy Colton,

378
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:41,642
and I'd like to resubmit our
letter and application, please.

379
00:20:51,018 --> 00:20:53,121
- Hey.
- Hey.

380
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:54,387
-Hey, can I
show you something?

381
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:55,723
Yeah, sure.

382
00:21:03,363 --> 00:21:04,297
Who's this?

383
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:05,867
-You remember
asking to see that

384
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:07,334
when you were about eight?

385
00:21:09,971 --> 00:21:13,941
-Dad, is that Brian and Melissa?

386
00:21:14,041 --> 00:21:15,275
-Yeah.

387
00:21:16,476 --> 00:21:20,280
We stopped for lunch
on the way home from church.

388
00:21:21,849 --> 00:21:24,819
And out of the blue,
you asked us

389
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:27,420
if you could meet
your birth mother.

390
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:32,492
And so, Mom, uh, asked
what you would say to her

391
00:21:32,593 --> 00:21:33,828
if you could meet her.

392
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:40,968
And you said, "I would say,
hi, my name is David".

393
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,208
-And then you asked us
if we had a picture of them,

394
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,777
so when we got home,
I showed that to you.

395
00:21:51,078 --> 00:21:56,617
And you looked at it
for a minute, and you said,

396
00:21:56,717 --> 00:22:00,521
"Wow, they look like
nice people".

397
00:22:02,723 --> 00:22:04,457
And you gave it back to me.

398
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:08,361
-How old were they?

399
00:22:08,461 --> 00:22:14,502
- I think
she was 18 and he was 17.

400
00:22:15,970 --> 00:22:19,073
She was pregnant
when she graduated.

401
00:22:20,274 --> 00:22:22,143
Think about that.

402
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:25,213
Imagine how scared
she must have been.

403
00:22:25,313 --> 00:22:29,817
And then, deciding to
place you for adoption

404
00:22:29,917 --> 00:22:34,055
must have been the hardest
decision of her entire life.

405
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:39,727
But I'm so glad she did it.

406
00:22:41,963 --> 00:22:43,564
David

407
00:22:43,664 --> 00:22:46,767
God gave you to
me and Mom as a gift.

408
00:22:48,236 --> 00:22:50,403
And you'll always be our son.

409
00:23:12,894 --> 00:23:15,029
-Is this how
you want your baby to live?

410
00:23:16,664 --> 00:23:17,899
Our baby.

411
00:23:24,272 --> 00:23:25,806
We could move back in
with my dad.

412
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:29,442
- Well then,
you're gonna have to tell him.

413
00:23:30,244 --> 00:23:32,880
And you already know he's not
going to let you keep it.

414
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,315
We got this place
to get away from him

415
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:35,883
and now you wanna go back?

416
00:23:38,386 --> 00:23:42,623
Melissa, we haven't
even eaten today.

417
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,605
-What are you doing?

418
00:23:57,705 --> 00:23:58,773
You're gotta put it
through the eye.

419
00:23:58,873 --> 00:24:01,809
-I got it. I know
how to bait my own hook.

420
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:13,688
Look, I can't be
a father right now.

421
00:24:15,056 --> 00:24:16,456
I can't.

422
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:19,794
Maybe one day, but I

423
00:24:22,462 --> 00:24:24,532
We gotta finish school.
I gotta get a job.

424
00:24:24,632 --> 00:24:26,734
-I can't just
turn this off, Brian.

425
00:24:30,838 --> 00:24:32,673
It may feel like you can
because you're not the one

426
00:24:32,773 --> 00:24:34,575
carrying it,
but I can't do that.

427
00:24:37,945 --> 00:24:39,747
-I just wanna do
what's best for us, Melissa.

428
00:24:39,847 --> 00:24:41,048
-Yeah.

429
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,722
I just wanna do
what's best for the baby.

430
00:24:55,863 --> 00:24:56,897
I honestly had no idea

431
00:24:56,998 --> 00:24:59,734
that this many people
wanted to adopt.

432
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,971
-Look at this couple.

433
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:06,173
-Um, no. He looks weird.

434
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:07,675
-No, he doesn't.

435
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:11,278
Okay, yeah, he does.

436
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:15,716
-What are we even looking for?

437
00:25:17,418 --> 00:25:18,753
-People like us.

438
00:25:19,754 --> 00:25:21,689
At least people that like
what we like.

439
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,158
Like, better people than us,

440
00:25:24,258 --> 00:25:28,095
but people that would like us
if they knew us.

441
00:25:28,195 --> 00:25:28,896
You're weird.

442
00:25:28,996 --> 00:25:30,831
-No, I'm not.
-Yeah, you are.

443
00:25:30,931 --> 00:25:35,436
-Well, you're living with me,
so what does that make you?

444
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:42,777
"Dear Mother,
as honored as I was

445
00:25:42,877 --> 00:25:47,348
"to win the prestigious title, Miss Sout

446
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:50,351
"now all I want
is the title, Mommy.

447
00:25:50,451 --> 00:25:52,019
And that's where you come in."

448
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:54,922
This is Ugh.

449
00:25:55,022 --> 00:25:56,624
-Listen to this.

450
00:25:56,724 --> 00:25:59,927
"We like to go
camping and fishing,

451
00:26:00,027 --> 00:26:02,096
and we love outdoor activities."

452
00:26:08,035 --> 00:26:09,603
"And we've lost two boys
to Aicardi syndrome

453
00:26:09,703 --> 00:26:11,806
"at a very early age

454
00:26:12,907 --> 00:26:14,408
"We don't care
if it's a boy or a girl,

455
00:26:14,509 --> 00:26:16,343
we just want to be parents."

456
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:23,150
-Do you wanna put them
on the wall?

457
00:26:25,986 --> 00:26:30,257
-Yes, but I kinda
want to ask them a question.

458
00:26:30,357 --> 00:26:32,527
-What do you wanna ask?

459
00:26:32,626 --> 00:26:34,662
-I wonder if I can call.

460
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:36,730
-I don't think you can do that.

461
00:26:36,831 --> 00:26:40,701
-No, I can,
through the agency, yeah.

462
00:26:40,801 --> 00:26:42,837
-You really
want to call them?

463
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:52,813
-Hello? Yes.

464
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,685
Um, okay.

465
00:27:00,354 --> 00:27:01,856
Just a moment.

466
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:11,499
Susan

467
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,503
it's the adoption agency.

468
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:15,803
There's a birth mother
on the line

469
00:27:15,903 --> 00:27:17,938
with a question for you.

470
00:27:18,038 --> 00:27:19,173
-For me?

471
00:27:22,743 --> 00:27:25,446
-I resubmitted our application.

472
00:27:25,547 --> 00:27:27,414
-You did?

473
00:27:27,516 --> 00:27:29,817
Is she she's on the phone
right now?

474
00:27:35,089 --> 00:27:36,357
Hello?

475
00:27:36,457 --> 00:27:38,492
<i>Hi, is this Susan?</i>

476
00:27:38,593 --> 00:27:40,261
-Yes.

477
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:46,267
-Um, I just wanted
to ask you a question.

478
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:47,501
-Okay.

479
00:27:47,602 --> 00:27:53,007
-Um, you said on your letter
that you like to go fishing,

480
00:27:53,107 --> 00:27:59,146
and I just wanna know
how you bait your hook?

481
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:04,084
-Uh
When, when we go fishing,

482
00:28:04,185 --> 00:28:07,388
uh, we use the,
the Cocahoe Minnow,

483
00:28:07,488 --> 00:28:10,625
and you have to put the hook
through the eye of the minnow.

484
00:28:10,724 --> 00:28:13,427
That's the way
I've always baited my hook.

485
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:21,168
-Um, that's really good.

486
00:28:21,268 --> 00:28:22,303
Um

487
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:27,408
Then I want you
to be the mother.

488
00:28:37,952 --> 00:28:43,891
-What? What?
What did she say?

489
00:28:43,991 --> 00:28:46,493
-She wants me to be the mom.

490
00:28:46,595 --> 00:28:49,196
-What?
That's, that's wonderful!

491
00:28:49,296 --> 00:28:50,898
-I didn't know
you were gonna do that, Jimmy.

492
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:53,067
-Oh, no.
Honey, just listen.

493
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:07,448
-I'm, I'm sorry. I
I'm just not ready to let go.

494
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:11,852
-And I can't go through
another loss.

495
00:29:11,952 --> 00:29:12,920
-Honey--
-Just can't do it.

496
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:14,188
-Sit down, sit down.
Listen to me.

497
00:29:14,288 --> 00:29:16,023
Sit down, sit down.

498
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:17,559
-She might call
and change her mind.

499
00:29:17,659 --> 00:29:18,792
-No, but we don't know that.

500
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:23,497
She, she just called
and said she chose you.

501
00:29:23,598 --> 00:29:26,967
-Yeah. Yeah.

502
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,537
-We wanna trust God, right?

503
00:29:30,838 --> 00:29:33,774
No matter what happens.

504
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:35,075
We want what's best
for the child

505
00:29:35,175 --> 00:29:38,946
and what's best
for the birth mother.

506
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:43,951
And, and even if she decides
to keep the baby, can

507
00:29:44,051 --> 00:29:46,453
can we just
take this step together

508
00:29:46,554 --> 00:29:48,255
and trust God with it?

509
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:51,191
-I just don't
-Okay, just one step at a time.

510
00:29:53,695 --> 00:29:56,598
-Just one step. Okay.

511
00:29:56,698 --> 00:30:00,034
Okay, just one step.

512
00:30:01,235 --> 00:30:03,571
One step at a time.

513
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:10,010
- Hmm.

514
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,162
-Okay, listen, I didn't say
I was gonna do it.

515
00:30:28,262 --> 00:30:30,665
You know, I'm just
thinking about doing it.

516
00:30:30,765 --> 00:30:33,500
-Bro, look,
I'm really proud of you.

517
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:34,569
-All right. Okay.

518
00:30:34,669 --> 00:30:35,936
-And I know
you love your family,

519
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:38,439
but you've never really
seemed okay with being adopted.

520
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,174
I mean, you've basically
tried to hide it.

521
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:41,875
-I have not tried to hide it.

522
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:43,243
-Yes, you have.

523
00:30:43,344 --> 00:30:45,245
-Not talking about it doesn't mean I've

524
00:30:45,346 --> 00:30:46,514
-Look at me.

525
00:30:46,614 --> 00:30:49,584
Are you okay with people knowing that yo

526
00:30:49,684 --> 00:30:53,020
-Yes.

527
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,056
Mostly. Not really.

528
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:57,091
-See, I don't know why.

529
00:30:57,191 --> 00:30:58,325
You have a great family.

530
00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,694
You know,
most people would kill

531
00:30:59,794 --> 00:31:01,362
to have a family
like yours or mine.

532
00:31:01,462 --> 00:31:02,597
-Nate!

533
00:31:02,697 --> 00:31:04,131
I didn't say
you could take my car.

534
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:05,899
I said that I would
meet you at my car.

535
00:31:05,999 --> 00:31:08,202
Come on, give me my keys,
I'm late for work!

536
00:31:10,904 --> 00:31:12,039
Hey, David.
-Reese.

537
00:31:12,139 --> 00:31:13,508
-Hey, did Mom drive you?

538
00:31:13,608 --> 00:31:14,642
-Craig did.
-Craig?

539
00:31:14,743 --> 00:31:15,810
You're back together with Craig?

540
00:31:15,909 --> 00:31:17,244
Mind your own business, Nate!

541
00:31:17,344 --> 00:31:20,280
And take that video down now
before anyone else sees it.

542
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:21,248
-You posted it?

543
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:22,650
-Well, we'll catch up
later, all right?

544
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:24,719
Catch me up then.

545
00:31:24,819 --> 00:31:26,987
Uh, I'm gonna need a ride home.

546
00:31:27,087 --> 00:31:30,391
-You drove me here.

547
00:31:30,491 --> 00:31:32,259
-That's not good.

548
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:35,563
Mr. Russell.

549
00:31:35,663 --> 00:31:36,831
-Hey, David. What's up?

550
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:39,900
-Um Listen, I was, uh

551
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,970
thinking more about
that whole speech thing.

552
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,105
-Yeah, and?

553
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,675
-I'm thinking I might,
uh, try it.

554
00:31:47,776 --> 00:31:51,178
-Really? That's, uh
That's great.

555
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,515
What made you change your mind?

556
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:56,450
-I guess I just needed
some perspective.

557
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:59,353
I can certainly understand that.

558
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:51,639
-Hi.

559
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:03,984
God, if you're there,

560
00:33:04,084 --> 00:33:06,320
please protect him
and watch over him.

561
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:43,558
It's not just the home
we walk into,

562
00:33:43,658 --> 00:33:45,793
or the meals we share.

563
00:33:45,894 --> 00:33:48,796
It's the knowledge that,
whatever comes,

564
00:33:48,897 --> 00:33:52,332
hardship or celebration,
the ones we love

565
00:33:52,432 --> 00:33:54,802
will be there
to share those moments,

566
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:58,873
to amplify the joys,
and to help carry the burdens.

567
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:03,545
It's God's beautiful design,
of this gift we call family.

568
00:34:03,645 --> 00:34:04,913
Thank you.

569
00:34:09,082 --> 00:34:10,384
Thank you, Anna.

570
00:34:10,484 --> 00:34:13,955
Our last speaker this evening
is also a senior,

571
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,792
who decided to enter
just two days ago.

572
00:34:17,892 --> 00:34:20,762
Please welcome, David Colton.

573
00:34:44,886 --> 00:34:49,524
-Uh I've always wondered

574
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:53,928
if my biological parents
think about me.

575
00:34:54,028 --> 00:34:56,496
And I guess, maybe,
it bothers me

576
00:34:56,598 --> 00:35:01,268
when people know
that I'm, uh adopted.

577
00:35:01,368 --> 00:35:05,907
But it really
shouldn't bother me. Um

578
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:09,309
Because no matter
the circumstances,

579
00:35:09,409 --> 00:35:14,616
I now have a family
who chose to adopt me,

580
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:17,085
and who loves me.

581
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,519
And yet, for some reason,

582
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:23,223
I struggle
to be content with that.

583
00:35:23,323 --> 00:35:26,761
I guess, maybe I didn't
want to feel different,

584
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:30,397
or less valued.

585
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,902
But I think
a lot of those thoughts

586
00:35:35,003 --> 00:35:40,240
are only in my head, and
they aren't actually reality.

587
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,012
And when I step back
and look at my life

588
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,245
from a wider perspective,

589
00:35:45,345 --> 00:35:51,251
I see how much a gift
my parents really are,

590
00:35:52,854 --> 00:35:56,057
and that adoption
has brought us together

591
00:35:56,156 --> 00:36:00,628
in a unique and beautiful way.

592
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:04,632
And because I'm absolutely sure
that their lives

593
00:36:04,732 --> 00:36:08,368
would be a lot more boring without me th

594
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:16,778
-Um, so, so, the more
I live my life,

595
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:22,150
the more I believe that
there's really no reason

596
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:25,953
to feel differently.

597
00:36:26,054 --> 00:36:29,289
We don't all take the same path.

598
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:35,228
But I'm thankful for the family
that God's given me.

599
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:41,769
When I think of family,
I think of home.

600
00:36:42,737 --> 00:36:47,141
And I wouldn't trade that
for the world.

601
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,375
Thank you.

602
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,318
-The judges have made
their decisions.

603
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:33,286
-I think I handled
wrestling better.

604
00:37:33,386 --> 00:37:38,492
-The winning speech,
and the 500-dollar cash prize

605
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:39,727
goes to

606
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,263
Sandra Benham.

607
00:37:50,437 --> 00:37:52,405
-Ah, I may have read this
in the wrong order.

608
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:54,374
This year's runner up--

609
00:37:54,474 --> 00:37:55,710
-There's a runner up?

610
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:00,982
And a check for 250 dollars
goes to David Colton.

611
00:38:03,217 --> 00:38:05,318
-Oh, David!

612
00:38:32,613 --> 00:38:34,314
-Yo, David!
-What's up, man?

613
00:38:34,414 --> 00:38:36,217
-Swooping in
and taking the win.

614
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:37,317
-What's up, guys?

615
00:38:37,417 --> 00:38:38,753
I did not expect
to win anything.

616
00:38:38,853 --> 00:38:41,255
-Honestly, same, but
you beat us, so there's that.

617
00:38:41,388 --> 00:38:42,790
-That's true, yeah.
-I'm sorry.

618
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:43,758
-Oh, snacks.

619
00:38:43,858 --> 00:38:45,726
-At least Anna
didn't win again this year.

620
00:38:45,827 --> 00:38:47,662
I mean, she always--
-Shh, shh, dude, look.

621
00:38:47,762 --> 00:38:51,899
-Anna!
Great job on your speech.

622
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,868
Congrats.

623
00:38:53,968 --> 00:38:55,036
Rough.

624
00:38:55,136 --> 00:38:56,237
-Rough.

625
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:57,905
-Oh, we got Dana and Macy
go in the house.

626
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,406
Let's go. It's game time,
it's game time.

627
00:38:59,507 --> 00:39:01,809
Excuse us, gentlemen,
we're on it. Let's get it.

628
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:04,111
-Hey, so get this.
You know the graduation video?

629
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:05,445
-Yes.
-The one with the baby faces

630
00:39:05,546 --> 00:39:07,480
and the names and all their
information and stuff?

631
00:39:07,582 --> 00:39:08,816
I get to do it this year.

632
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,350
I told the school
I'd charge 500 bucks,

633
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,819
and they went for it.

634
00:39:11,919 --> 00:39:14,055
Hashtag debt free,
you know what I mean?

635
00:39:14,155 --> 00:39:15,890
-Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, dude. Um

636
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:17,424
-What's up?

637
00:39:21,996 --> 00:39:24,599
"David, this is Melissa.

638
00:39:24,699 --> 00:39:26,100
"I don't care
for social networking,

639
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,602
"so please forgive me.

640
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:30,071
"please let your parents know
that I'm reaching out to you.

641
00:39:30,171 --> 00:39:32,640
"I'm willing to tell you
anything you want to know.

642
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:35,243
"I do not want to hide anything.

643
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,545
"All I can say is, wow,

644
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,479
"they raised
the most wonderful boy

645
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,983
I've ever laid eyes on."

646
00:39:44,585 --> 00:39:45,686
That is mushy.

647
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,321
-Wow.

648
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,158
-Dude, is that your birth mom?

649
00:39:51,259 --> 00:39:52,627
-I'm gonna go
call my parents.

650
00:39:52,727 --> 00:39:54,562
-Yeah, dude, step out.

651
00:39:58,766 --> 00:40:00,968
Hey, hey, hey, uh,
you there, what

652
00:40:01,068 --> 00:40:04,605
I'm Nate, let's talk
about something. I'm, uh

653
00:40:06,439 --> 00:40:08,709
Yeah, I I know.

654
00:40:08,809 --> 00:40:11,512
Melissa, Melissa, listen. Melissa.

655
00:40:11,612 --> 00:40:15,082
I know that he is 18,
but why now?

656
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:20,521
No. No, no,
I'm not trying to say

657
00:40:20,621 --> 00:40:22,523
that there's a perfect time
for something like this.

658
00:40:22,623 --> 00:40:24,424
I'm, I'm just

659
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:35,569
Yeah. No, I get it.
I get it.

660
00:40:37,004 --> 00:40:43,044
And you are free to talk to him
if that is what you wanna do.

661
00:40:47,447 --> 00:40:48,883
Okay.

662
00:40:51,152 --> 00:40:53,921
Yeah, listen, I gotta go.
Thanks. Thanks for the call.

663
00:41:05,533 --> 00:41:09,103
-Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

664
00:41:09,203 --> 00:41:10,371
Are you serious?

665
00:41:12,773 --> 00:41:15,676
-What are you thinking?

666
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,645
Come on, answer me!
What are you thinking?

667
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:19,013
-I wanna go home, Brian.

668
00:41:19,113 --> 00:41:20,548
-Well, well, do you wanna
have a kid in high school?

669
00:41:20,648 --> 00:41:21,582
Is that what you want?
-Can we please just go home?

670
00:41:21,682 --> 00:41:22,783
-Is that,
is that what you want?

671
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:26,520
-What are you gonna do?

672
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:33,394
Melissa!
What are you going to do?

673
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:34,395
-I don't know.

674
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:35,763
You don't know.

675
00:41:45,973 --> 00:41:48,709
-Well, she was
a ball of energy tonight.

676
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:50,311
We should have
put her down at eight

677
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:52,279
before she caught
her second wind.

678
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,781
-Yeah.

679
00:41:57,885 --> 00:42:01,789
-Hey, uh
What are you thinking?

680
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,658
You hadn't said one word
this entire night.

681
00:42:08,496 --> 00:42:11,499
-I, uh

682
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,301
There's something
I need to tell you.

683
00:42:14,402 --> 00:42:16,804
-Okay.

684
00:42:16,904 --> 00:42:18,839
-It's something I should have told you a

685
00:42:18,939 --> 00:42:20,274
But uh

686
00:42:24,678 --> 00:42:26,680
-Brian, what is it?

687
00:42:30,985 --> 00:42:32,853
-I have a son.

688
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,993
-A son?

689
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:50,604
With um with Melissa?

690
00:42:52,606 --> 00:42:54,642
-Yeah.

691
00:43:00,014 --> 00:43:03,651
I was still in high school.

692
00:43:03,751 --> 00:43:09,790
And I've just had a hard time
telling anyone.

693
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:28,709
I'm so sorry.
I should have told you.

694
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:31,178
-Yeah.

695
00:43:48,195 --> 00:43:49,697
Okay.

696
00:43:53,434 --> 00:43:55,035
Okay.

697
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,675
Look at me.

698
00:44:04,645 --> 00:44:07,715
I am here for you,
no matter what.

699
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,356
-Okay. Okay.

700
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:25,466
-I think it's a good
first response

701
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:29,504
as long as you're sure you don't
want it to go any further.

702
00:44:29,604 --> 00:44:32,373
-Yeah, but Dad, I don't know
how far I want this to go.

703
00:44:32,473 --> 00:44:34,074
I mean, I don't even know her.

704
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:37,646
A part of me wants to know
what my life would've been like.

705
00:44:37,745 --> 00:44:41,715
But my only problem is,
thinking it might be best

706
00:44:41,815 --> 00:44:44,285
not to get involved at all, so

707
00:44:46,253 --> 00:44:50,157
-Yeah, would, would be safer
to just leave it alone.

708
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:56,163
You know, just
Just let them live their life.

709
00:44:56,263 --> 00:45:01,936
Then again, it could be
really healing for Melissa

710
00:45:02,036 --> 00:45:03,737
to hear from you, and,

711
00:45:03,837 --> 00:45:07,141
and see what an amazing man
you've become.

712
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,845
Did you look up Brian?

713
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:14,982
-Yeah.
Yeah, no, I did. Um

714
00:45:15,082 --> 00:45:18,986
But I mean, he never posts
really anything, so

715
00:45:19,086 --> 00:45:21,922
-Hmm. Well, maybe
if you respond to Melissa,

716
00:45:22,022 --> 00:45:24,659
you could reach out to him too.

717
00:45:24,758 --> 00:45:28,829
Either way,
we'll support you.

718
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:35,637
-Oh, Nate is coming over
a little later to interview me.

719
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:36,937
-Interview you?

720
00:45:37,037 --> 00:45:38,640
-Oh, he wants to
film this whole thing

721
00:45:38,739 --> 00:45:41,008
and make it
like a documentary.

722
00:45:41,108 --> 00:45:42,042
It's Nate.

723
00:45:42,142 --> 00:45:46,548
-Should be interesting.
All right, David. Later.

724
00:45:46,648 --> 00:45:48,115
-Later.

725
00:45:55,222 --> 00:45:59,893
-Stars! Airplane!
I see an airplane.

726
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:11,038
#Um, you might
want to look at this.

727
00:46:22,483 --> 00:46:26,820
I can respond if you want.

728
00:46:33,628 --> 00:46:35,496
-Okay, good.

729
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:40,301
-I always wondered why
they put me up for adoption.

730
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:43,270
I guess I just put it
out of my mind

731
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:44,739
because I didn't
want to be different.

732
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:45,906
-You didn't
want to be an idiot?

733
00:46:46,006 --> 00:46:47,007
-I didn't want to be different.
Different.

734
00:46:47,107 --> 00:46:48,510
-Okay, good,
that's a lot better.

735
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:51,945
Let's go with that.
But next time, give me more.

736
00:46:53,682 --> 00:46:54,716
-More what?

737
00:46:54,815 --> 00:46:56,751
-I don't know, more emotion, something e

738
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,053
Look, dude, I need to
feel it in your words.

739
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:01,121
I need to see it
in those eyes, okay?

740
00:47:01,221 --> 00:47:02,724
-What?
What are you talking about?

741
00:47:02,856 --> 00:47:05,926
-You have the emotion
of a rock.

742
00:47:06,026 --> 00:47:07,461
I need you to pull me in
a little bit.

743
00:47:07,562 --> 00:47:10,464
Talk about not fitting in,
and I don't know,

744
00:47:10,565 --> 00:47:12,499
just, just don't hold
anything back, all right?

745
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,301
Give it all to me.
-Okay.

746
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:15,704
- Okay.
- Sure.

747
00:47:15,804 --> 00:47:16,805
-Are you ready?

748
00:47:16,904 --> 00:47:20,207
And Action.

749
00:47:20,307 --> 00:47:23,010
-I didn't want to be different!

750
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,079
I just wanted to fit in!

751
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,113
Dude, are you kidding me?

752
00:47:26,213 --> 00:47:27,816
-What is wrong with me
right now?

753
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:29,416
-Okay, all right,
that's a cut. That's a cut.

754
00:47:29,517 --> 00:47:33,420
- I'm I'm, I'm so emotional
right now.

755
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:35,422
Such a diva.

756
00:47:35,523 --> 00:47:37,257
I'm so emotional.

757
00:47:45,299 --> 00:47:51,338
Oh, it's Brian's wife.
My birth father's wife.

758
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:54,576
-Oh, okay, hold on.
Let me, let me get this.

759
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,913
Right, okay, you ready? Go.

760
00:48:01,148 --> 00:48:03,083
-"Um This is a lot
for Brian to process.

761
00:48:03,183 --> 00:48:05,185
"He wants to take it slow.

762
00:48:05,285 --> 00:48:09,022
I'm sorry if this isn't
what you were hoping for."

763
00:48:09,123 --> 00:48:12,192
-How does that make you feel?

764
00:48:12,292 --> 00:48:14,294
-He doesn't want to talk, so

765
00:48:14,395 --> 00:48:15,295
-Dude

766
00:48:15,396 --> 00:48:18,533
-Oh, I'm sorry.
He doesn't wanna talk to me!

767
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:19,768
-Okay. Are you serious?

768
00:48:19,868 --> 00:48:20,769
Does that work?

769
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,202
-Are you guys okay?

770
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:23,772
-Oh, I'm trying to get
some amount of emotion

771
00:48:23,872 --> 00:48:25,540
out of this heart of stone.

772
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:27,742
-Oh, bless you, honey.

773
00:48:27,842 --> 00:48:29,711
Thanks, Mom.

774
00:48:29,811 --> 00:48:31,478
-No way!

775
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:32,446
What is it?

776
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:34,448
-I just got a message
back from Melissa.

777
00:48:34,549 --> 00:48:36,049
-What did she say?

778
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:40,522
She wants to meet.

779
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:42,389
-Really?

780
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:43,424
-Yeah.

781
00:48:43,525 --> 00:48:45,426
-Wow. Wow!

782
00:48:45,527 --> 00:48:48,395
-Okay, wait. I

783
00:48:48,495 --> 00:48:51,566
I didn't think
we'd meet in person.

784
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:53,735
-Does does that make you
feel uncomfortable?

785
00:48:53,835 --> 00:48:56,571
Mom, camera is on.

786
00:48:56,671 --> 00:48:59,206
-Oh. I'm sorry, okay.

787
00:48:59,306 --> 00:49:01,208
I'll just
I'll leave you guys to it.

788
00:49:01,308 --> 00:49:03,277
- Bye, Mrs. C.
- Bye.

789
00:49:03,377 --> 00:49:06,848
-Dude, why does it taste
so much better at your house?

790
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:09,450
Okay, what happened there,
I liked that.

791
00:49:09,551 --> 00:49:12,319
We're gonna pull it around.
Let's do this.

792
00:49:12,419 --> 00:49:15,055
And action.

793
00:49:17,057 --> 00:49:19,694
-I just wish he'd
open up to me more, you know?

794
00:49:19,794 --> 00:49:22,764
-Do you think maybe
you're just prying too much?

795
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:26,099
-I'm not trying to pry.
It's just that

796
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,235
is he even going about this
the right way?

797
00:49:28,335 --> 00:49:30,939
-Honey, do you think
there is a certain way

798
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:33,608
that he should be
going about this?

799
00:49:33,708 --> 00:49:35,610
- All right.

800
00:49:36,811 --> 00:49:38,245
You know what it is?

801
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:39,379
I, I've been
picturing this moment

802
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,014
ever since
he was a little guy.

803
00:49:41,114 --> 00:49:44,017
And, and now we're here.
And I just thought we would

804
00:49:44,117 --> 00:49:46,487
I don't know,
take this journey together.

805
00:49:46,588 --> 00:49:48,222
Instead, he's upstairs
on his computer.

806
00:49:48,322 --> 00:49:50,491
And unless he tells me
what he's doing,

807
00:49:50,592 --> 00:49:52,326
I really don't know
what he's doing.

808
00:49:52,426 --> 00:49:55,095
-David's gotta want to
do this for himself.

809
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:59,066
He's not gonna do it at all
if he feels pushed.

810
00:49:59,166 --> 00:50:01,903
-You're right, you're right.

811
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:10,110
-Hello? Yes.

812
00:50:13,781 --> 00:50:15,349
I have a son?

813
00:50:20,655 --> 00:50:22,256
I have a son!

814
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:25,225
Sure, um I

815
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:28,061
Yes, we, we can leave
right away.

816
00:50:28,161 --> 00:50:29,998
Okay, thank you.

817
00:50:30,097 --> 00:50:31,031
Congratulations!

818
00:50:31,131 --> 00:50:32,299
-Uh, we have to
leave right now.

819
00:50:32,399 --> 00:50:33,968
Uh, the suitcases.
I'm gonna get the suitcases.

820
00:50:34,067 --> 00:50:36,069
I'll take care
of the kitchen.

821
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:37,805
-I forgot to install
the car seat.

822
00:50:37,906 --> 00:50:38,973
I've gotta get the car seat.

823
00:50:39,072 --> 00:50:40,173
Car's not there.
Susan has it.

824
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:42,476
-Susan! I
I forgot to call Susan!

825
00:50:42,577 --> 00:50:44,111
-Where do you keep
your dish cloths?

826
00:50:44,211 --> 00:50:46,213
-Uh, they're in the drawer.

827
00:50:46,313 --> 00:50:48,616
-I've got the car seat
and the suitcase.

828
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:51,084
-Thanks, uh
Just put them by the door.

829
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:53,487
No, not that drawer.
That's, that's Susan's

830
00:50:53,588 --> 00:50:55,088
-Hey, she's in.
She's pulling in.

831
00:50:55,188 --> 00:50:56,456
-Okay. All right,
everybody, stay calm.

832
00:50:56,558 --> 00:51:00,962
Stay calm, all right?
I will tell her.

833
00:51:01,061 --> 00:51:03,130
Oh, this is so exciting.

834
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:06,199
-Well, I did not find
our favorite ice cream,

835
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,570
but I did find
our favorite cookies.

836
00:51:13,841 --> 00:51:16,476
-We got the call.

837
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:19,146
We have a son.

838
00:51:19,246 --> 00:51:21,783
-We have a son?

839
00:51:21,883 --> 00:51:23,116
Are you sure?

840
00:51:23,216 --> 00:51:25,252
-I'm sure.

841
00:51:25,352 --> 00:51:29,189
-Jimmy, are you sure?

842
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:32,727
-The birth mother
already signed the papers.

843
00:51:34,494 --> 00:51:36,998
-A son.

844
00:51:37,097 --> 00:51:38,465
-Let's go get him!

845
00:51:38,566 --> 00:51:39,466
-Okay.

846
00:51:39,567 --> 00:51:40,434
Mom
- Go!

847
00:51:40,535 --> 00:51:42,704
We'll look after the house.
You just go.

848
00:51:42,804 --> 00:51:44,304
Okay.

849
00:52:29,282 --> 00:52:31,886
He feels perfect.

850
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,725
He feels perfect.

851
00:52:58,946 --> 00:53:03,417
Okay, here's David Colton.

852
00:53:03,518 --> 00:53:07,021
You're home.
You see, you're home.

853
00:53:07,121 --> 00:53:08,488
Hi, buddy!

854
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:12,392
Can you smile?

855
00:53:15,163 --> 00:53:16,764
Hi!

856
00:53:20,467 --> 00:53:21,769
-Maybe you don't
wanna bite Daddy.

857
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,037
-All right,
you want some of the goodness?

858
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:25,973
Here you go.
- He seems ready.

859
00:54:07,782 --> 00:54:09,951
Get him on the line.

860
00:54:14,522 --> 00:54:18,059
There we go.
Yeah! Here we go.

861
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:22,462
Come on, what are you
doing over there?

862
00:54:26,968 --> 00:54:28,435
Hey.

863
00:54:29,771 --> 00:54:31,906
All right, all right.
How do y'all like that?

864
00:54:32,006 --> 00:54:33,975
-It's great.
It's great. Wow.

865
00:54:34,075 --> 00:54:35,308
Caught more than me.

866
00:54:35,408 --> 00:54:37,344
We got a bunch of them.

867
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,547
You know what, this is
the greatest, right?

868
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:42,617
That's how
you like it.

869
00:54:42,717 --> 00:54:44,384
Yeah, now,
pull the burnt part off,

870
00:54:44,484 --> 00:54:45,920
put the rest of it
back down in there

871
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:47,054
and get some more brown on it.

872
00:54:47,155 --> 00:54:48,923
Well, that's how you got
your fingers all sticky.

873
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:51,259
Well, of course I do.

874
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:52,627
Hey, so, um

875
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:54,829
Melissa said
she and her husband

876
00:54:54,929 --> 00:54:57,131
actually don't live that far
from Brian and Azure.

877
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,003
Did Brian give a reason
for not being ready to talk?

878
00:55:03,805 --> 00:55:04,839
-Um

879
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,241
No.

880
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:08,576
No, he didn't.

881
00:55:09,442 --> 00:55:13,346
Um, I guess it's just
a lot for him to process.

882
00:55:13,446 --> 00:55:16,117
-How is Melissa?

883
00:55:16,217 --> 00:55:18,351
-She's nice. Um

884
00:55:18,451 --> 00:55:20,922
I mean, she's a little
paranoid of social media.

885
00:55:21,022 --> 00:55:21,823
Um

886
00:55:21,923 --> 00:55:23,558
Yeah,
I can understand that.

887
00:55:23,658 --> 00:55:26,093
I don't really like it either.

888
00:55:26,194 --> 00:55:28,663
-I mean, we've, you know,

889
00:55:28,763 --> 00:55:32,600
we've written back and forth several tim

890
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,702
I mean,
she still wants to meet.

891
00:55:36,403 --> 00:55:38,072
And, uh

892
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,042
I'm thinking about it.

893
00:55:49,550 --> 00:55:51,719
-Do you know
what'd you say to her?

894
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:56,924
-"Thank you".

895
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,695
I'd thank her, too.

896
00:56:02,163 --> 00:56:03,898
She gave us our grandson.

897
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,067
-Yeah, she did.

898
00:56:06,167 --> 00:56:07,400
- Yeah.

899
00:56:15,076 --> 00:56:16,744
-Beat ya!

900
00:56:16,844 --> 00:56:17,578
-Yeah.

901
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,046
-You owe me a back-rub.

902
00:56:19,146 --> 00:56:20,380
That's two out of three.

903
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,983
-I can count.

904
00:56:24,552 --> 00:56:27,788
Still, just one more.

905
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:37,298
-All right,
what's the deal?

906
00:56:37,397 --> 00:56:39,367
-You're throwing it
like a baseball.

907
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:40,735
-Best three out of five.

908
00:56:40,835 --> 00:56:43,638
-I knew
you were gonna say that.

909
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:45,806
You can't change the rules.

910
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:46,941
I won.

911
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:51,312
So how's David?

912
00:56:51,411 --> 00:56:53,281
I don't know.

913
00:56:53,381 --> 00:56:55,216
I mean, he's cordial.

914
00:56:55,316 --> 00:56:57,952
But I say a lot,
he says a little.

915
00:56:58,052 --> 00:57:01,421
-Well, that can't be
surprising to you.

916
00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:04,292
-I know I talk too much.

917
00:57:06,827 --> 00:57:08,428
But I just

918
00:57:10,298 --> 00:57:13,567
It'd be nice
to actually see him.

919
00:57:17,305 --> 00:57:19,307
-Why don't you
ask God for it?

920
00:57:19,407 --> 00:57:24,779
- Oh, I have.
Like, a lot.

921
00:57:56,911 --> 00:57:58,212
Can you grill
the chicken too, please?

922
00:57:58,312 --> 00:57:59,380
-Yeah.

923
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,716
-Just hit speaker.

924
00:58:04,185 --> 00:58:05,119
Hello?

925
00:58:05,219 --> 00:58:07,822
<i>Hi, I'm looking</i>
<i>for Melissa Cates.</i>

926
00:58:07,922 --> 00:58:08,923
-I'm here.

927
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,825
<i>This is Mandy</i>
<i>from Kirsh and Clark.</i>

928
00:58:10,925 --> 00:58:14,428
<i>We've, uh, received a message</i>
<i>from David Colton.</i>

929
00:58:14,528 --> 00:58:18,399
<i>He said that you guys have been</i>
<i>talking over the internet,</i>

930
00:58:18,498 --> 00:58:21,469
<i>and he's open to</i>
<i>meeting in person.</i>

931
00:58:21,569 --> 00:58:22,636
<i>But, of course,</i>
<i>that would have to be</i>

932
00:58:22,737 --> 00:58:24,372
<i>acceptable to both parties.</i>

933
00:58:24,472 --> 00:58:28,275
-Oh, um, yes.
Yes, we are.

934
00:58:28,376 --> 00:58:30,745
We'd be happy to meet in person.

935
00:58:30,845 --> 00:58:32,246
Where do we need to go?

936
00:58:32,346 --> 00:58:35,649
<i>Well, apparently,</i>
<i>he's willing to come to you.</i>

937
00:58:36,884 --> 00:58:38,085
-He is?

938
00:58:38,185 --> 00:58:39,020
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

939
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:41,622
<i>How would you</i>
<i>like us to respond?</i>

940
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:50,331
-Right, uh, tell us
what you're doing,

941
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:51,399
what you're about to go do?

942
00:58:51,499 --> 00:58:52,666
-Okay, so, uh,

943
00:58:52,767 --> 00:58:55,803
I wrote my parents
and my grandparents letters

944
00:58:55,903 --> 00:58:57,506
because there's a few things
I wanted to tell them

945
00:58:57,605 --> 00:58:59,874
before I go and meet
my birth mom.

946
00:59:06,247 --> 00:59:09,683
Uh, before Mom and Dad and I
go to Indiana,

947
00:59:09,784 --> 00:59:12,820
I wanted to share something
with you, guys.

948
00:59:14,188 --> 00:59:19,927
When the idea of going to visit
my birth mom first came up,

949
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:23,497
I thought it would make things
uncomfortable.

950
00:59:23,597 --> 00:59:25,733
But a part of me wanted to

951
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:29,538
fill this missing
piece of the puzzle.

952
00:59:29,637 --> 00:59:32,139
-Hon, do you feel that
something has been missing

953
00:59:32,239 --> 00:59:33,674
from your life?

954
00:59:33,774 --> 00:59:35,376
-I, I guess
I shouldn't say

955
00:59:35,476 --> 00:59:37,945
"missing piece of the puzzle". I

956
00:59:38,045 --> 00:59:41,916
It's more about
asking the question of

957
00:59:42,016 --> 00:59:43,751
what my life
would have been like.

958
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:45,286
And, just simply
thanking Melissa

959
00:59:45,386 --> 00:59:46,887
for the choice that she made.

960
00:59:46,987 --> 00:59:50,391
-Honey, puzzles
are a big part of life, right?

961
00:59:50,491 --> 00:59:53,727
And if you want to fill in
a piece that you don't have,

962
00:59:53,828 --> 00:59:55,596
we're all for it.

963
00:59:55,696 --> 00:59:59,200
-I think that this trip
might even be a discovery

964
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,501
of how big that piece is.

965
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:01,702
Hmm.

966
01:00:01,802 --> 01:00:04,939
-And not just for you,
but for, for all of us.

967
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:07,675
-I guess I just wanted to
share something

968
01:00:07,775 --> 01:00:11,946
with the most significant
people in my life.

969
01:00:12,046 --> 01:00:15,550
So uh

970
01:00:15,649 --> 01:00:16,650
I wrote you these.

971
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:17,985
-Oh, here you go.

972
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:43,244
"I'm not sure
how either of you feels

973
01:00:43,344 --> 01:00:46,347
"when you think about
Melissa and Brian,

974
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:48,382
"and how I'm not
your birth son,

975
01:00:51,118 --> 01:00:53,420
"and that bothers me sometimes.

976
01:00:54,321 --> 01:00:56,390
"I hope the fact
that they're my birth parents

977
01:00:56,490 --> 01:01:01,128
"never deters you from realizing that th

978
01:01:01,228 --> 01:01:02,997
"are my true parents.

979
01:01:04,999 --> 01:01:06,267
"And I hope that I never

980
01:01:06,367 --> 01:01:09,436
do anything to make it seem
like I don't know that."

981
01:01:11,172 --> 01:01:12,206
Honey

982
01:01:13,340 --> 01:01:17,311
that never bothers me a bit.

983
01:01:17,411 --> 01:01:19,180
It's irrelevant.

984
01:01:20,447 --> 01:01:24,718
Oh, David, I love you.

985
01:01:29,323 --> 01:01:31,725
-I'm gonna treasure this.

986
01:01:31,825 --> 01:01:34,563
-We both will.

987
01:01:34,663 --> 01:01:36,931
-I just don't want
anyone to feel replaced.

988
01:01:38,533 --> 01:01:41,468
-I already know you love us.

989
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:43,137
Now I just have proof.

990
01:01:57,084 --> 01:01:58,085
-You don't have to
film everything, you know.

991
01:01:58,185 --> 01:02:00,154
I'm not.
Just almost everything.

992
01:02:00,254 --> 01:02:01,388
Now, tell me
what you're thinking.

993
01:02:01,488 --> 01:02:02,990
-I'm thinking you don't
have to film everything.

994
01:02:03,090 --> 01:02:04,925
-Dude, this is why I came.

995
01:02:05,025 --> 01:02:07,161
Trust my genius.
It's all part of it.

996
01:02:07,261 --> 01:02:10,197
"David Steps Out,
and Finds Himself Within".

997
01:02:10,297 --> 01:02:11,098
-What does that mean?

998
01:02:11,198 --> 01:02:12,733
-Well, it's the title
of the movie.

999
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:13,968
-That's dumb.

1000
01:02:14,068 --> 01:02:16,136
-Okay, what about,
"Journey of Uncertainty"?

1001
01:02:16,237 --> 01:02:18,172
-That's worse.
-"Questie with My Bestie"?

1002
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:19,206
-Stop.
-Fine.

1003
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:20,207
You'll thank me one day.

1004
01:02:20,307 --> 01:02:21,509
Hey, where are we
meeting your parents?

1005
01:02:21,610 --> 01:02:23,678
Uh, at the hotel.

1006
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:25,446
I can't believe they decided
to drive this far.

1007
01:02:25,547 --> 01:02:27,781
Yeah, that's commitment.

1008
01:02:27,881 --> 01:02:29,416
-Well, you're their only kid,
so

1009
01:02:29,517 --> 01:02:33,287
Ah, luxury!
I call top bunk!

1010
01:02:44,031 --> 01:02:46,066
-Okay, I'm heading
over there.

1011
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:48,369
I'll be back in about an hour.

1012
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:51,972
You really should tell him
before he gets here.

1013
01:02:52,072 --> 01:02:53,407
-I know.

1014
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:57,011
I know.

1015
01:02:57,111 --> 01:02:58,178
-Okay.

1016
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:20,434
-Oh, wow!

1017
01:03:20,535 --> 01:03:21,569
-What?

1018
01:03:22,803 --> 01:03:24,271
-It's Melissa.

1019
01:03:25,607 --> 01:03:29,343
I need to tell you something that I have

1020
01:03:29,443 --> 01:03:31,078
-Well, what is it?

1021
01:03:31,178 --> 01:03:33,947
-Oh, I don't know.
It says she's still typing.

1022
01:03:34,048 --> 01:03:38,152
-Dude, what if she won
the lottery and she's loaded?

1023
01:03:38,252 --> 01:03:39,654
She won the lottery
and she's loaded,

1024
01:03:39,754 --> 01:03:40,789
and when we get there,

1025
01:03:40,888 --> 01:03:43,057
there's gonna be
like a massive house.

1026
01:03:43,157 --> 01:03:44,024
-No.

1027
01:03:44,124 --> 01:03:44,958
-Or maybe she feels bad
that she's loaded,

1028
01:03:45,059 --> 01:03:45,926
and she didn't tell you.

1029
01:03:46,026 --> 01:03:46,927
-What?
-So when you get there,

1030
01:03:47,027 --> 01:03:47,995
she's gonna give you a portion

1031
01:03:48,095 --> 01:03:50,732
and then you're
gonna be loaded too!

1032
01:03:50,831 --> 01:03:52,066
-She stopped typing.

1033
01:03:58,205 --> 01:03:59,406
-What did she say?
-She hasn't sent anything.

1034
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:00,841
-Okay. All right, look.

1035
01:04:00,941 --> 01:04:02,276
The minute you get
the text back,

1036
01:04:02,376 --> 01:04:05,112
I need you to read it out
and with a big reaction, okay?

1037
01:04:13,120 --> 01:04:14,355
-She's still typing!

1038
01:04:15,989 --> 01:04:16,890
-What's the rush?

1039
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,192
-I gotta go
to the bathroom.

1040
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:20,060
- Then go!
- I can't miss your reaction.

1041
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:23,197
Okay, don't read it
until I get back, okay?

1042
01:04:40,981 --> 01:04:42,216
-Oh, wow!

1043
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:47,354
Oh, wow.

1044
01:04:47,454 --> 01:04:49,156
Oh, wow.

1045
01:04:49,256 --> 01:04:50,625
Did you respond?
Did she read it?

1046
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:52,092
Did you respond?

1047
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:55,597
You have a sister.

1048
01:04:55,697 --> 01:04:57,699
You have a
You have a sister?

1049
01:04:57,799 --> 01:04:59,900
- Mm-mm.
- Dude!

1050
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,502
This is crazy!

1051
01:05:01,603 --> 01:05:03,437
This is like
This is like

1052
01:05:03,538 --> 01:05:05,339
Luke, I am your father!

1053
01:05:05,439 --> 01:05:06,907
-I'm pretty sure
it's not the same thing.

1054
01:05:07,007 --> 01:05:10,110
-This is huge!

1055
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,446
What's her name?
Is it

1056
01:05:12,547 --> 01:05:15,583
Is it Leia? Is it Rey?

1057
01:05:16,350 --> 01:05:19,486
Her name's Courtney,
and she's 12.

1058
01:05:19,587 --> 01:05:21,155
This is incredible!

1059
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:22,724
Oh, okay, this is good.
All right.

1060
01:05:22,824 --> 01:05:25,259
Sorry.
Let's do this.

1061
01:05:25,359 --> 01:05:28,095
Really focus in on me.
Give me a good reaction

1062
01:05:28,195 --> 01:05:29,664
like you just got the text
for the first time.

1063
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:30,899
You ready? Okay?

1064
01:05:30,998 --> 01:05:33,500
And Go.

1065
01:05:33,601 --> 01:05:35,936
-I have a sister.

1066
01:05:36,036 --> 01:05:37,605
-Can you pull tears?

1067
01:05:41,643 --> 01:05:42,710
<i>What?</i>

1068
01:05:42,811 --> 01:05:44,546
Are you serious?

1069
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:45,680
-What? What is it?

1070
01:05:46,848 --> 01:05:47,782
-Melissa just told David

1071
01:05:47,882 --> 01:05:50,284
that he has a 12-year-old
sister!

1072
01:05:51,719 --> 01:05:55,055
I can't believe it!

1073
01:06:14,876 --> 01:06:16,076
-Hey, what's up, Mrs. C?

1074
01:06:16,176 --> 01:06:19,581
-Hi. Is David ready?

1075
01:06:19,681 --> 01:06:20,582
-Uh, he's still powdering

1076
01:06:20,682 --> 01:06:22,650
his nose so he can--
- No, I'm not!

1077
01:06:24,586 --> 01:06:26,019
Hey, Mom.
-Hey.

1078
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:28,322
Oh, that's nice.
I like that.

1079
01:06:28,422 --> 01:06:29,456
Yeah.

1080
01:06:29,557 --> 01:06:32,927
- So, did you ever hear from Br

1081
01:06:33,026 --> 01:06:35,329
-Uh, no.

1082
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:37,565
Not at this point,
I'm not really expecting to.

1083
01:06:41,101 --> 01:06:42,236
-Ah, did you

1084
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:43,303
did you have enough breakfast
this morning?

1085
01:06:43,403 --> 01:06:45,138
-Yeah.
No, I'm good. I'm good.

1086
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:47,909
You know, I'm a little
nervous, but uh

1087
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:49,309
-Yeah.

1088
01:06:49,409 --> 01:06:50,410
-I'm okay.

1089
01:06:50,512 --> 01:06:51,411
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1090
01:06:51,513 --> 01:06:52,547
-Good.

1091
01:06:53,948 --> 01:06:56,551
- You all right?

1092
01:06:56,651 --> 01:06:58,051
-Who, me?

1093
01:06:58,151 --> 01:07:00,755
Oh, yeah, pfft, I'm good.

1094
01:07:00,855 --> 01:07:01,756
I'm real good.

1095
01:07:01,856 --> 01:07:04,692
-All right.
-Yeah. Um

1096
01:07:04,792 --> 01:07:08,128
So, so Dad's down in the lobby,
and I'm gonna go meet him.

1097
01:07:08,228 --> 01:07:09,998
And you just come down
in like ten minutes,

1098
01:07:10,097 --> 01:07:11,599
is that good?
-Okay. Okay.

1099
01:07:11,699 --> 01:07:13,500
-Bye.
-Bye.

1100
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:15,369
Hey, hey, Mom?

1101
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:16,370
-Yeah?

1102
01:07:19,607 --> 01:07:21,843
-Look, I'm

1103
01:07:21,943 --> 01:07:24,278
I know I don't say it enough
but, uh

1104
01:07:26,014 --> 01:07:27,549
I love you.

1105
01:07:32,085 --> 01:07:35,523
You are and always
will be my mom.

1106
01:07:36,558 --> 01:07:38,927
-David.

1107
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:40,260
Thank you.

1108
01:07:41,461 --> 01:07:45,332
Um I think I really
needed to hear that today.

1109
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,837
I love you.

1110
01:08:04,484 --> 01:08:08,188
-David, what makes you
most nervous?

1111
01:08:09,557 --> 01:08:11,358
-Um

1112
01:08:12,392 --> 01:08:17,599
I guess, just to see
what they're like, to see um

1113
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:20,200
What traits I may have
gotten from them.

1114
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:22,937
-Environment
plays a very big part.

1115
01:08:23,037 --> 01:08:23,938
-Yeah, yeah,
I gotta know where I get

1116
01:08:24,038 --> 01:08:25,540
all my good looks from, so

1117
01:08:27,909 --> 01:08:30,945
-I think
we're almost there.

1118
01:08:47,327 --> 01:08:49,363
She's gonna be out
right now.

1119
01:09:13,755 --> 01:09:15,690
I love you.

1120
01:09:15,790 --> 01:09:17,091
It's good to meet you.

1121
01:09:24,297 --> 01:09:26,500
-Hey, can I have a hug too?

1122
01:09:28,201 --> 01:09:31,572
Hi. I love you.

1123
01:09:32,573 --> 01:09:35,877
I love you.

1124
01:09:35,977 --> 01:09:37,344
Thank you.

1125
01:09:41,281 --> 01:09:42,517
-Melissa,
it's good to see you.

1126
01:09:42,617 --> 01:09:43,751
-You too.

1127
01:09:57,464 --> 01:09:59,332
I want you to meet someone.

1128
01:10:15,783 --> 01:10:16,651
-Hi, Courtney.
-Hi.

1129
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:18,820
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

1130
01:10:24,257 --> 01:10:25,358
-Hi, I'm David.

1131
01:10:25,459 --> 01:10:27,227
-Shawn Cates.
Good to meet you, David.

1132
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,696
-Nice to meet you too, man.

1133
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:30,732
-Hey, Shawn Cates.

1134
01:10:30,832 --> 01:10:31,999
-Jimmy Colton.
Pleasure to meet you.

1135
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,500
Good to meet you.

1136
01:10:33,601 --> 01:10:35,636
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

1137
01:10:35,737 --> 01:10:37,705
-Good to see you.
-Nice to meet you.

1138
01:10:42,242 --> 01:10:47,314
-Oh.
Everybody, come inside.

1139
01:10:53,187 --> 01:10:54,822
-Nice to meet you.

1140
01:10:56,858 --> 01:10:59,193
Yeah, you guys, make yourself
at home. Have a seat.

1141
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:00,528
Thank you.

1142
01:11:03,296 --> 01:11:04,732
Happy tears.

1143
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,002
-I know.

1144
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:10,671
I've been crying all day.

1145
01:11:10,772 --> 01:11:11,973
I'm sorry.

1146
01:11:14,374 --> 01:11:17,410
I wanna say so much,

1147
01:11:17,512 --> 01:11:19,113
and I don't even know
where to start.

1148
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:22,517
-I, I'll I'll start. Um

1149
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:25,052
well, first off,
I just wanted to say

1150
01:11:27,188 --> 01:11:28,488
thank you.

1151
01:11:29,257 --> 01:11:32,960
Thank you for making
the choice that you did

1152
01:11:33,060 --> 01:11:38,599
almost 19 years ago,
to uh let me be adopted.

1153
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:43,604
I mean, you allowed me to
have the life that I have now.

1154
01:11:45,472 --> 01:11:47,708
And actually I, um

1155
01:11:47,809 --> 01:11:50,211
I was wondering if
I could hear your story,

1156
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:53,014
and why you made
the choice that you did.

1157
01:11:54,282 --> 01:11:55,550
Okay.

1158
01:11:58,085 --> 01:12:01,421
Um it was a confusing time.

1159
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,792
Scary, you know?

1160
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,665
Your adoption was hard and easy,
all at the same time.

1161
01:12:10,765 --> 01:12:13,333
I mean, going through
those "Dear Mother" letters

1162
01:12:13,433 --> 01:12:15,203
was overwhelming.

1163
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:18,039
-How many letters
did you read through?

1164
01:12:18,139 --> 01:12:22,710
-I don't even know. A lot.

1165
01:12:22,810 --> 01:12:28,850
But I just knew, when I got
your parents' letter, I knew.

1166
01:12:30,483 --> 01:12:33,087
I wanted your mom
to be down to earth.

1167
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:36,356
Basically, someone like me

1168
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:40,460
what I could have been.

1169
01:12:42,797 --> 01:12:47,134
To do the things
I wanted to do with you,

1170
01:12:47,235 --> 01:12:48,903
but I knew I couldn't.

1171
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:54,909
I wanted you to have a mom
to be there for you,

1172
01:12:55,977 --> 01:12:59,113
and she couldn't be afraid
to get her hands dirty.

1173
01:13:01,148 --> 01:13:02,817
-Do you remember calling me?

1174
01:13:02,917 --> 01:13:05,052
-I do. I do.

1175
01:13:05,152 --> 01:13:07,722
-My hands were shaking.

1176
01:13:07,822 --> 01:13:09,824
I didn't know what to expect.

1177
01:13:09,924 --> 01:13:11,391
-When I was getting
further and further

1178
01:13:11,491 --> 01:13:14,228
into your story

1179
01:13:14,328 --> 01:13:17,565
into your parents' story,

1180
01:13:17,665 --> 01:13:20,301
it just grabbed me.

1181
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,837
Your parents
seemed to be genuine.

1182
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:25,539
They seemed to have
genuine faith.

1183
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:30,811
So, were you mad at me?

1184
01:13:32,880 --> 01:13:33,915
-Never.

1185
01:13:38,686 --> 01:13:41,956
-Did you ever think
that I didn't want you?

1186
01:13:42,056 --> 01:13:42,823
-Um

1187
01:13:42,924 --> 01:13:45,026
-Uh, I would understand
if you did.

1188
01:13:45,126 --> 01:13:47,427
-Uh, no. No, I'm

1189
01:13:48,596 --> 01:13:51,866
I think I just wondered
if you ever thought about me.

1190
01:13:53,734 --> 01:13:56,237
That was my only concern.

1191
01:13:56,337 --> 01:14:01,242
Listen I'm so grateful
for my life.

1192
01:14:01,342 --> 01:14:02,610
But

1193
01:14:03,711 --> 01:14:05,579
I had a hard time
telling people

1194
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:09,417
that I was adopted because

1195
01:14:09,517 --> 01:14:12,687
I hadn't really realized
what that meant yet.

1196
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,724
But I'm glad
that I'm adopted.

1197
01:14:19,360 --> 01:14:24,497
-I thought about you
every day.

1198
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:29,971
When you know your baby's
not coming home with you

1199
01:14:30,738 --> 01:14:33,774
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't jealous.

1200
01:14:35,509 --> 01:14:38,879
There's about every emotion
you could feel.

1201
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:45,786
But I knew you were
going to the right place.

1202
01:14:54,195 --> 01:14:55,262
-Thank you.

1203
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:59,000
I've had a great life.

1204
01:15:00,668 --> 01:15:03,037
I know you have.

1205
01:15:03,137 --> 01:15:05,239
-That's because of you.

1206
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:08,642
You gave that to me.

1207
01:15:14,148 --> 01:15:15,549
-Thank you.

1208
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:30,998
That was Brian.

1209
01:15:31,966 --> 01:15:34,268
He's agreed to meet with you.

1210
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:38,105
-Wow. Really?

1211
01:15:38,205 --> 01:15:42,176
-He just asked if we could
let him know sometime today.

1212
01:16:24,585 --> 01:16:26,887
-Hey, David, I wanted to
ask you something.

1213
01:16:26,987 --> 01:16:29,256
-Yeah, sure.
What's up?

1214
01:16:29,356 --> 01:16:30,491
-Oh.
-Don't mind me,

1215
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,293
I'm just filming everything.

1216
01:16:32,393 --> 01:16:33,694
By the way, this is gold.

1217
01:16:33,794 --> 01:16:38,365
-So, I'm kind of a tomboy,
and like a little adventure.

1218
01:16:38,466 --> 01:16:42,937
Shawn does too, as long as
it doesn't include heights.

1219
01:16:43,037 --> 01:16:45,139
I've seen your
cliff jumping videos,

1220
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:47,475
and I wondered if you would
do something with me.

1221
01:16:47,576 --> 01:16:49,844
-Yeah, what's up?

1222
01:16:49,944 --> 01:16:52,613
-Would you go skydiving
with me while you're here?

1223
01:16:52,713 --> 01:16:54,915
No one will go with me.

1224
01:16:55,015 --> 01:16:55,916
-Yeah, are,
are you kidding?

1225
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:57,218
I've I've always
wanted to go,

1226
01:16:57,318 --> 01:16:58,219
and no one will ever take me!

1227
01:16:58,319 --> 01:16:59,753
Mom, Dad, can we?

1228
01:16:59,854 --> 01:17:01,355
-Uh, we'll, we'll watch
from the ground.

1229
01:17:03,924 --> 01:17:04,625
I'm in.

1230
01:17:04,725 --> 01:17:05,626
-Really?
-Yeah.

1231
01:17:05,726 --> 01:17:08,129
-Yes!
-Let's do it!

1232
01:17:08,229 --> 01:17:09,296
Let's go tomorrow.

1233
01:17:09,396 --> 01:17:10,631
- Let's go tomorrow.
- Let's do it!

1234
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:13,667
Hey, did you get
some good stuff?

1235
01:17:13,767 --> 01:17:14,935
-Hah, incredible.

1236
01:17:15,035 --> 01:17:17,171
This was the best day
I've ever photographed.

1237
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:21,675
-You know, I guess

1238
01:17:21,775 --> 01:17:23,010
since you're the official
videographer,

1239
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,514
that means you have to like,
film everything, right?

1240
01:17:25,614 --> 01:17:26,581
-Yeah. Duh.

1241
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,681
-Good.

1242
01:17:27,781 --> 01:17:29,150
Then you're coming
skydiving with us.

1243
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,651
-Ha! No, no.

1244
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:33,487
No, no.
Nate is not jumping.

1245
01:17:33,588 --> 01:17:39,426
That won't happen.
Never. Ever.

1246
01:17:42,229 --> 01:17:42,930
No, no, no.

1247
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:45,232
-Jump, Nate!
Just jump!

1248
01:17:45,332 --> 01:17:47,134
-I don't wanna jump.

1249
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:49,737
Why are you my friend?

1250
01:17:49,837 --> 01:17:50,738
Why are you my friend?

1251
01:18:02,584 --> 01:18:04,385
-Hey, let's do it!

1252
01:18:04,485 --> 01:18:06,153
See you there!

1253
01:18:06,253 --> 01:18:08,122
Yeah!

1254
01:18:08,222 --> 01:18:11,225
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

1255
01:18:15,696 --> 01:18:17,998
- Ready?
- Yeah, let's do it!

1256
01:18:18,098 --> 01:18:20,801
Whoo!

1257
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:22,671
Yeah, all right!

1258
01:18:27,741 --> 01:18:30,711
-Melissa's got
a little adventure in her.

1259
01:18:30,811 --> 01:18:32,246
-She sure does.

1260
01:18:32,346 --> 01:18:34,815
-Yeah!

1261
01:18:36,217 --> 01:18:38,553
-David seems to be
pretty even-keeled.

1262
01:18:38,653 --> 01:18:40,689
-Whoo!

1263
01:18:40,788 --> 01:18:44,491
Yeah! Whoo!

1264
01:18:44,593 --> 01:18:46,060
-This Nate fella

1265
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,361
-Oh my God,
is this right?

1266
01:18:47,461 --> 01:18:49,230
Oh my God,
is this right?

1267
01:18:50,798 --> 01:18:52,866
-He looks
a little dramatic.

1268
01:18:52,967 --> 01:18:56,437
- Please! Please!

1269
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:01,742
Maybe a touch.

1270
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,515
I love this!

1271
01:19:09,049 --> 01:19:10,818
Yeah!

1272
01:19:17,358 --> 01:19:18,459
Whoo!

1273
01:19:19,426 --> 01:19:20,461
Whoo!

1274
01:19:21,495 --> 01:19:22,530
All right!

1275
01:19:27,201 --> 01:19:29,903
Yeah!
Wasn't that a rush?

1276
01:19:30,004 --> 01:19:31,338
-It was a rush.
-Did you like it?

1277
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:32,873
-I did! It's amazing!

1278
01:19:32,973 --> 01:19:35,075
-Yeah! We did it.

1279
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:37,746
-Wow! Wow, wow, wow, wow.

1280
01:19:43,618 --> 01:19:46,387
-Hey!
Did you survive over there?

1281
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:53,394
So not worth it!
So not worth it.

1282
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:55,929
I'm just gonna
take a minute.

1283
01:19:56,030 --> 01:19:57,298
You guys, go ahead.

1284
01:19:57,398 --> 01:20:01,736
Lord Jesus, thank you for bringing me ba

1285
01:20:01,835 --> 01:20:04,506
-Hey, I don't know
how much time you have

1286
01:20:04,606 --> 01:20:08,610
before you leave,
but after you meet with Brian,

1287
01:20:08,710 --> 01:20:10,712
can I show you one more thing?

1288
01:20:10,811 --> 01:20:13,113
-Yeah, sure. Um

1289
01:20:13,213 --> 01:20:16,216
How about this, uh,
Saturday morning?

1290
01:20:16,317 --> 01:20:17,017
Does that work?

1291
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:18,218
-Perfect.
-Awesome.

1292
01:20:18,319 --> 01:20:19,253
We're going to
dinner still, right?

1293
01:20:20,387 --> 01:20:22,089
-So you're not gonna
tell me what it is?

1294
01:20:24,224 --> 01:20:25,593
-Not yet.

1295
01:20:55,489 --> 01:20:56,591
-Ready?

1296
01:20:56,691 --> 01:20:57,826
-More than ever.

1297
01:20:57,925 --> 01:20:59,761
-He said we can
just go around the back.

1298
01:20:59,893 --> 01:21:01,128
-All right.

1299
01:21:01,895 --> 01:21:03,364
-Take a moment,
and slow it down.

1300
01:21:17,512 --> 01:21:19,246
-Presley, baby, come here.

1301
01:21:21,415 --> 01:21:22,617
Hey.

1302
01:21:22,717 --> 01:21:23,951
-What's up, Brian?
-What's up?

1303
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:25,452
Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1304
01:21:26,987 --> 01:21:30,625
Uh, don't let the
camera guy weird you out.

1305
01:21:30,725 --> 01:21:31,992
Um This is uh Nate.

1306
01:21:32,092 --> 01:21:33,360
-Nice to meet you.
-My best friend.

1307
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:37,297
He wanted to help us
remember all of this.

1308
01:21:37,398 --> 01:21:39,801
-Yeah, well,
I'll do my best to ignore you.

1309
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:40,968
The guy with the camera.

1310
01:21:42,737 --> 01:21:43,705
-Well, come on, sit.

1311
01:21:43,805 --> 01:21:45,239
- Sure, uh Hi.
- Hi.

1312
01:21:45,339 --> 01:21:46,608
-Yeah, Azure.

1313
01:21:46,708 --> 01:21:48,008
Thank you. Thank you.

1314
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,646
- Hey.
- Brian.

1315
01:21:51,746 --> 01:21:52,647
Nice to meet you.

1316
01:21:52,747 --> 01:21:54,281
-Glad y'all came out.

1317
01:21:54,381 --> 01:21:57,685
Come on, just, uh
Just grab a spot.

1318
01:21:57,786 --> 01:21:58,952
Hey.
- Nice to meet you.

1319
01:21:59,052 --> 01:22:00,487
-You too.

1320
01:22:00,588 --> 01:22:02,524
Please, um

1321
01:22:05,959 --> 01:22:08,897
-Hey, uh I just wanna say
thank you, uh

1322
01:22:08,996 --> 01:22:10,532
for letting us stop by.

1323
01:22:11,633 --> 01:22:12,534
Very kind of you.

1324
01:22:12,634 --> 01:22:13,568
-Yeah, yeah,
you're welcome.

1325
01:22:13,668 --> 01:22:14,702
-Yeah.

1326
01:22:17,304 --> 01:22:20,140
-You know, I've, I've been
carrying this secret with me

1327
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:23,645
for almost two decades now. So

1328
01:22:23,745 --> 01:22:26,280
Didn't tell my wife
until a couple weeks ago.

1329
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:29,383
Yeah, and that was a relief.

1330
01:22:37,057 --> 01:22:39,727
You know, my
my mom was adopted.

1331
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:44,766
Yeah, her mom couldn't
raise her and

1332
01:22:44,866 --> 01:22:46,233
You know,
she hated her for it,

1333
01:22:46,333 --> 01:22:49,102
so I always figured
that you'd hate me too.

1334
01:22:49,203 --> 01:22:53,407
-No. I-I-I don't
hate you at all.

1335
01:22:57,110 --> 01:22:58,412
-It's good to hear.

1336
01:23:01,281 --> 01:23:05,219
Um you know, that's why
I had such a hard time,

1337
01:23:05,319 --> 01:23:08,088
uh choosing adoption.

1338
01:23:08,188 --> 01:23:09,389
Because of that.

1339
01:23:09,490 --> 01:23:11,659
But now that
I look back at it, I

1340
01:23:13,595 --> 01:23:17,464
you know, the other option
that we considered was worse.

1341
01:23:17,565 --> 01:23:19,466
Much worse.

1342
01:23:19,567 --> 01:23:20,635
And I'm sorry.

1343
01:23:22,503 --> 01:23:24,371
It's kinda foolish
to think about now.

1344
01:23:26,608 --> 01:23:28,543
-Um

1345
01:23:28,643 --> 01:23:32,112
I, I I actually wanted
to, to thank you.

1346
01:23:32,212 --> 01:23:35,482
I mean, you're part
of the reason I have

1347
01:23:38,953 --> 01:23:40,889
all of this, you know.

1348
01:23:40,989 --> 01:23:42,122
Thank you.

1349
01:24:01,241 --> 01:24:02,810
So, Presley
is five years old?

1350
01:24:02,911 --> 01:24:04,411
- Yeah.

1351
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:08,016
Yeah, I guess, uh

1352
01:24:08,115 --> 01:24:10,552
I guess she would be
David's half-sister, huh?

1353
01:24:11,886 --> 01:24:13,320
-Yeah.

1354
01:24:16,824 --> 01:24:19,059
-Thank you.

1355
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:22,664
For raising him in a way
that I know I never could.

1356
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:26,300
I, um I'm certain

1357
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,502
that he's gonna go much farther
than I ever did.

1358
01:25:05,006 --> 01:25:06,239
-No, no, Reese, you

1359
01:25:07,008 --> 01:25:08,843
No, you have to tell
Mom and Dad.

1360
01:25:10,277 --> 01:25:11,879
No, you don't know that.

1361
01:25:14,549 --> 01:25:17,117
Just Just calm down, okay? Listen

1362
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:21,121
I, I know. I know but

1363
01:25:22,757 --> 01:25:26,060
Okay. All right.
I-I-I get it, yeah.

1364
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,494
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

1365
01:25:31,633 --> 01:25:33,233
Whoa!

1366
01:25:33,333 --> 01:25:36,269
Hey. You good, man?

1367
01:25:37,672 --> 01:25:39,439
-No, I'm not.

1368
01:25:40,340 --> 01:25:42,242
-Hey, hey, hey.
What's up?

1369
01:25:47,247 --> 01:25:49,117
-My sister

1370
01:25:49,216 --> 01:25:51,318
She got back
with her idiot boyfriend.

1371
01:25:54,088 --> 01:25:55,523
And she's pregnant.

1372
01:25:57,792 --> 01:25:59,259
- Dude

1373
01:25:59,359 --> 01:26:00,360
-You can't tell anybody,
all right?

1374
01:26:00,460 --> 01:26:02,295
-No, I won't. All right?

1375
01:26:04,297 --> 01:26:08,468
- Why, dude?
She said she was done with him!

1376
01:26:20,648 --> 01:26:22,717
- Dad, there's Melissa.
- Okay. Oh, where?

1377
01:26:22,817 --> 01:26:23,851
Right over there.

1378
01:26:38,265 --> 01:26:39,332
-Hey.
-Hey.

1379
01:26:39,433 --> 01:26:40,735
Thanks for meeting me here.

1380
01:26:40,835 --> 01:26:41,969
-Yeah, of course.

1381
01:26:45,106 --> 01:26:48,943
Uh So, where are we?

1382
01:26:53,047 --> 01:26:54,015
-Nineteen years ago,

1383
01:26:54,115 --> 01:26:57,217
when I found out
that I was pregnant

1384
01:26:57,317 --> 01:26:59,419
Brian and I
drove here together.

1385
01:27:02,523 --> 01:27:06,393
This fence was lined
with protesters.

1386
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:16,904
I came here to have an abortion.

1387
01:27:21,843 --> 01:27:22,910
When I got out,

1388
01:27:24,212 --> 01:27:26,379
they put a blanket over my head

1389
01:27:26,480 --> 01:27:30,484
and a radio beside each ear
to drown out all the noise.

1390
01:27:30,585 --> 01:27:34,387
-We're gonna put this
over your head to protect you.

1391
01:27:36,758 --> 01:27:38,826
<i>As I was walking in,</i>

1392
01:27:38,926 --> 01:27:40,228
<i>even with all the noise</i>

1393
01:27:40,327 --> 01:27:41,996
You're not alone,
don't do it.

1394
01:27:42,096 --> 01:27:44,498
<i> I could</i>
<i>still hear their voices.</i>

1395
01:27:44,599 --> 01:27:45,900
<i>I heard this woman say</i>

1396
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,502
Your baby has
ten fingers and ten toes.

1397
01:27:48,603 --> 01:27:50,805
Please, please,
don't kill it!

1398
01:27:53,641 --> 01:27:56,343
-"Your baby has ten fingers
and ten toes.

1399
01:27:56,443 --> 01:27:57,912
Please don't kill it."

1400
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,987
So we get inside.

1401
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:10,490
And they make you pay immediately.

1402
01:28:17,165 --> 01:28:19,366
<i>So I go back,</i>

1403
01:28:19,466 --> 01:28:20,935
<i>I had my gown on.</i>

1404
01:28:22,637 --> 01:28:25,506
<i>I sat down on a cold table.</i>

1405
01:28:27,041 --> 01:28:31,478
<i>There was a tray with</i>
<i>all these tools on it.</i>

1406
01:28:33,380 --> 01:28:35,883
<i>And the door opens,</i>
<i>and the doctor walks in,</i>

1407
01:28:37,118 --> 01:28:39,386
<i>puts on a new pair of gloves,</i>

1408
01:28:39,486 --> 01:28:42,657
<i>sat down</i>
<i>on a little silver chair</i>

1409
01:28:42,757 --> 01:28:44,725
<i>and scooted across the room.</i>

1410
01:28:47,261 --> 01:28:49,931
Told me to put my feet
in the stirrups.

1411
01:28:54,401 --> 01:29:00,241
<i>I laid back, turned my head.</i>

1412
01:29:00,908 --> 01:29:06,948
And I heard the words,
"Get up, there's still time".

1413
01:29:10,350 --> 01:29:14,255
<i>Right when he went to touch me,</i>
<i>I said, "I can't do this."</i>

1414
01:29:14,354 --> 01:29:16,356
<i>He just backed up,</i>

1415
01:29:17,357 --> 01:29:19,293
<i>ripped his gloves off,</i>

1416
01:29:19,392 --> 01:29:21,494
<i>threw them in the trash</i>
<i>and left.</i>

1417
01:29:24,431 --> 01:29:26,499
<i>He didn't say a word to me.</i>

1418
01:29:31,539 --> 01:29:33,074
So I got up and left.

1419
01:29:37,745 --> 01:29:39,180
<i>They don't protect you</i>
<i>when you leave.</i>

1420
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:41,115
<i>They protect you</i>
<i>when you come in.</i>

1421
01:29:43,317 --> 01:29:44,952
So all those people

1422
01:29:46,721 --> 01:29:48,022
they thought I did it.

1423
01:30:03,638 --> 01:30:05,438
Those few seconds

1424
01:30:07,208 --> 01:30:08,976
You wouldn't be standing here.

1425
01:30:11,012 --> 01:30:12,513
I would have killed you.

1426
01:30:15,216 --> 01:30:16,250
-I'm so sorry.

1427
01:30:22,356 --> 01:30:25,559
-Don't be.
You let me live.

1428
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:27,460
You've nothing to be sorry for.

1429
01:30:36,537 --> 01:30:38,873
-Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1430
01:31:08,602 --> 01:31:10,137
-I don't know
what I'm gonna tell her.

1431
01:31:13,207 --> 01:31:15,209
-Tell who?

1432
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:16,544
-Reese.

1433
01:31:17,945 --> 01:31:18,980
I just

1434
01:31:19,947 --> 01:31:21,048
You know, she's

1435
01:31:22,817 --> 01:31:25,553
probably thinking
the same thing that Melissa did.

1436
01:31:30,891 --> 01:31:32,093
Dude, her

1437
01:31:32,193 --> 01:31:34,795
her baby could be somebody's
best friend one day.

1438
01:31:39,667 --> 01:31:40,935
Hey.

1439
01:31:41,702 --> 01:31:43,571
Could I talk to her?

1440
01:31:46,173 --> 01:31:47,274
-Maybe.

1441
01:31:50,878 --> 01:31:52,613
She's pretty stubborn, dude.

1442
01:31:57,585 --> 01:32:01,589
Hey What about
Parker Avenue?

1443
01:32:01,689 --> 01:32:03,557
"I almost died
on Parker Avenue."

1444
01:32:03,657 --> 01:32:05,393
-Ooh, it's a little morbid.

1445
01:32:05,493 --> 01:32:07,061
Um

1446
01:32:08,996 --> 01:32:13,934
How about,
"I Lived on Parker Avenue?"

1447
01:32:14,035 --> 01:32:15,536
Mmm? Get it?

1448
01:32:15,636 --> 01:32:18,507
-All right, okay.
I like it.

1449
01:32:18,606 --> 01:32:20,841
I might use it. Maybe.

1450
01:32:50,037 --> 01:32:54,275
-So, now you have a full sister and a ha

1451
01:32:54,375 --> 01:32:57,512
-Um Yeah.

1452
01:32:59,180 --> 01:33:01,115
Isn't that kinda weird?

1453
01:33:01,215 --> 01:33:02,249
-Yeah, it is weird.

1454
01:33:04,051 --> 01:33:05,653
But, you know,
it's also kinda awesome.

1455
01:33:05,753 --> 01:33:08,255
You know, I-I-I just assumed
I was an only child.

1456
01:33:11,625 --> 01:33:12,993
So what now?

1457
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:16,297
Will you still see
your biological family?

1458
01:33:20,367 --> 01:33:21,969
-The Coltons are my family.

1459
01:33:23,838 --> 01:33:25,840
But, you know,
if everyone's okay with it,

1460
01:33:25,940 --> 01:33:28,175
we'll definitely
keep up with each other.

1461
01:33:31,245 --> 01:33:32,514
-I, uh

1462
01:33:32,613 --> 01:33:34,381
I'm not sure
it's always like that.

1463
01:33:38,853 --> 01:33:40,087
-Yeah, maybe not.

1464
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:46,727
But I can tell you that

1465
01:33:50,698 --> 01:33:52,800
I'm so glad
she got off that table.

1466
01:33:55,136 --> 01:33:59,974
I'm so glad
that I'm I'm here.

1467
01:34:04,513 --> 01:34:05,779
Reese

1468
01:34:07,549 --> 01:34:12,019
I was at that abortion clinic
19 years ago, in her womb.

1469
01:34:15,222 --> 01:34:17,057
And she let me live.

1470
01:34:21,195 --> 01:34:23,164
You know, I can only
thank God for that.

1471
01:34:25,432 --> 01:34:27,168
There's already so much death.

1472
01:34:29,970 --> 01:34:31,739
You could give life.

1473
01:34:34,509 --> 01:34:36,677
Life that is already
inside of you.

1474
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:40,781
If you and Craig
aren't ready,

1475
01:34:40,881 --> 01:34:44,485
there are many, many
men and women out there

1476
01:34:44,586 --> 01:34:46,320
who are ready to be parents.

1477
01:34:49,390 --> 01:34:50,858
Just like mine.

1478
01:35:02,002 --> 01:35:04,872
Would you at least
think about it?

1479
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:20,020
"Melissa, this is to
mark the day you chose life."

1480
01:35:28,429 --> 01:35:29,964
-Lifemark.

1481
01:35:33,334 --> 01:35:34,802
