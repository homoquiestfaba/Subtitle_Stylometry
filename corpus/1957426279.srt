1
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:56,469
Ah!

2
00:01:58,152 --> 00:02:01,811
Yeah, I'm just getting home
right now.

3
00:02:01,845 --> 00:02:03,192
I'm coming!

4
00:02:03,226 --> 00:02:04,952
I'm gonna have to call you...

5
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:07,748
I said I'm coming!
Calm down!

6
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,406
What could be so important?

7
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,374
Okay, I love you.
Bye.

8
00:02:15,687 --> 00:02:16,757
Hello?

9
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,828
I know about your brother.

10
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,832
Tell me where he is.

11
00:02:22,866 --> 00:02:24,489
There will be a package
waiting for you

12
00:02:24,523 --> 00:02:28,838
on mile marker 444 on route 66.

13
00:02:28,872 --> 00:02:30,564
Do you understand?

14
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:31,772
Who is this?

15
00:02:31,806 --> 00:02:33,083
It must be delivered

16
00:02:33,118 --> 00:02:35,914
within 24 hours to Santa Monica.

17
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,194
Where is my brother?

18
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:42,714
You have 72 minutes
to make the pickup.

19
00:02:42,748 --> 00:02:44,750
Your brother's life
depends on it.

20
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:14,297
Zitchen.

21
00:03:14,332 --> 00:03:16,437
Sir, I think that we have
a situation

22
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:18,957
on our hands here.

23
00:03:18,991 --> 00:03:20,959
What kind of situation?

24
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:21,891
It's Eckles, sir.

25
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,824
He didn't show up
for work this morning.

26
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:27,517
I searched his quarters,
pretty much the entire base.

27
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:29,347
Has the council been notified?

28
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:31,349
- No.
- Good. Keep it that way.

29
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,351
I'll take care of this.

30
00:03:33,385 --> 00:03:35,042
Zitchen out.

31
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,162
Who is this?

32
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:52,135
Aurora.

33
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:56,312
Response?

34
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:57,727
Epsilon.

35
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:02,801
Agent Dockins, you've been
activated for a new assignment.

36
00:07:10,947 --> 00:07:12,293
Ah!

37
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:26,238
Ah!

38
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:51,919
Hey!

39
00:07:52,506 --> 00:07:54,577
Where's the package?!

40
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:00,376
I think I've been in
some kind of an accident!

41
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,689
I can't remember anything!

42
00:08:02,723 --> 00:08:05,001
What do you know
about my brother!?

43
00:08:07,452 --> 00:08:09,558
I'm sorry!
I don't know you!

44
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:11,491
I don't know your brother!

45
00:08:11,525 --> 00:08:13,009
Stop screwing around!

46
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:15,909
Give me the package
or the deal is off!

47
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:18,843
I don't know anything
about a package!

48
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:29,163
Get in!

49
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,131
What?!

50
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:33,202
I'm not offering twice!

51
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,758
Ah.

52
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:48,448
You startled me.

53
00:09:49,658 --> 00:09:51,763
What's up, Dockins?
How's the morning treatin' you?

54
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:57,873
Fine.

55
00:09:58,632 --> 00:09:59,875
How's the stakeout?

56
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:02,602
Oh man, you know how these
federal investigations go.

57
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:04,362
Long and slow.

58
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,329
They got me tailin'
some spiccano up here,

59
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:08,297
next three weeks.

60
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,990
So how'd that child custody
thing work out for you?

61
00:10:12,025 --> 00:10:13,233
Any luck?

62
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,167
Weekends or anything?

63
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:17,755
Yo, man. Hey.

64
00:10:19,273 --> 00:10:20,827
You listenin' to me?

65
00:10:23,588 --> 00:10:25,348
What's the matter with you?

66
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,386
Man, are you all right?

67
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,409
Computer, lights on.

68
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,342
Greetings, Agent 11.

69
00:10:53,376 --> 00:10:55,344
Running system diagnostic.

70
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:59,589
Chamber operational level:
97 percent.

71
00:10:59,624 --> 00:11:01,350
Gelpacks charging.

72
00:11:01,384 --> 00:11:03,076
Downloading mission files.

73
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:06,527
Target: Special Officer
Christopher Eckles.

74
00:11:06,562 --> 00:11:08,081
Clearance level: Seven.

75
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:11,463
Current status: Unknown.
Presumed AWOL.

76
00:11:11,498 --> 00:11:13,189
Activate viewing chamber.

77
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:16,710
Viewing chamber activated.

78
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,401
Gelpacks charged.

79
00:11:18,436 --> 00:11:21,473
Your codename
for this mission is...

80
00:11:21,508 --> 00:11:23,613
Nicodemus.

81
00:11:34,935 --> 00:11:38,145
I'm now entering the main line.

82
00:11:47,845 --> 00:11:49,950
Ah!

83
00:12:04,551 --> 00:12:05,655
I'm in.

84
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:15,113
Tracing target signal.

85
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:21,568
There's a great deal
of back scatter.

86
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,156
Where are you?

87
00:12:28,402 --> 00:12:29,852
It's hot.

88
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,994
I can only see a few shapes...

89
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:37,929
and I-I can hear...

90
00:12:37,964 --> 00:12:40,690
a vehicle traveling
on a road somewhere.

91
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,348
Mountains.

92
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,318
No, we're in the desert.

93
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:53,669
Hold on, I'm getting something.

94
00:12:53,703 --> 00:12:54,843
What is it?

95
00:12:57,742 --> 00:12:59,502
A mile marker.

96
00:13:02,678 --> 00:13:04,818
No...

97
00:13:04,853 --> 00:13:06,337
Something's wrong.

98
00:13:07,096 --> 00:13:09,409
Something's wrong
with the target.

99
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:17,451
It's as if the signal has been
washed from the main line.

100
00:13:19,143 --> 00:13:21,248
I don't know how it's possible.

101
00:13:21,283 --> 00:13:22,905
Find him.

102
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,429
What are you up to, Eckles?

103
00:13:36,263 --> 00:13:39,232
I gotta go get some supplies.

104
00:13:39,266 --> 00:13:41,027
Don't move.

105
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,574
Who are you, lady?

106
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,555
Christopher?

107
00:14:37,152 --> 00:14:38,601
Can I help you?

108
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,224
I thought that was you.

109
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,158
Chris, it's me Trenton.

110
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,091
How long has it been?

111
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,576
What are you doing off base?

112
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,237
How do we know each other?

113
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,410
What?

114
00:14:55,239 --> 00:14:57,897
You were there
the day I was made.

115
00:14:57,931 --> 00:14:59,622
I've known you my whole life.

116
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:01,324
But I thought you worked
on base permanently.

117
00:15:01,348 --> 00:15:04,386
What is this?
A special assignment?

118
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:07,492
Where's your shirt?

119
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:11,462
What kind of work do I do?

120
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:16,777
I think I'm getting a call.

121
00:15:18,848 --> 00:15:20,678
I'll be right back.

122
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:23,612
Somebody's gotten to him.

123
00:15:24,302 --> 00:15:26,511
Oh man, this is bad.

124
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,203
This is really bad.

125
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:30,550
I can't believe
I have to turn him in.

126
00:15:30,584 --> 00:15:32,379
Why is he off base?

127
00:15:32,414 --> 00:15:34,588
Why doesn't he recognize me?

128
00:15:37,177 --> 00:15:39,490
They're gonna kill him.

129
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:40,836
They have to.

130
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:42,942
Nobody can know about us.

131
00:15:56,127 --> 00:15:57,577
Hey, Trenton.

132
00:16:04,308 --> 00:16:06,448
You'll never stop us.

133
00:16:41,828 --> 00:16:43,243
Hey.

134
00:16:47,627 --> 00:16:49,180
We should go.

135
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,185
Just relax for a second.

136
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:55,393
Turn around.

137
00:16:56,153 --> 00:16:58,258
Turn around.

138
00:17:13,963 --> 00:17:15,482
Where are we goin'?

139
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,692
I can't tell you.

140
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:26,286
So, uh, do you really
remember nothing?

141
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:29,324
Very little.

142
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,086
I feel memories in there,
like...

143
00:17:33,121 --> 00:17:35,364
like words on the tip
of my tongue,

144
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,504
but I can't get to 'em.

145
00:17:48,722 --> 00:17:50,414
Thanks.

146
00:18:47,781 --> 00:18:49,231
You found his chip?

147
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:50,405
Who is this?

148
00:18:50,439 --> 00:18:52,545
My code name is Nicodemus.

149
00:18:52,579 --> 00:18:55,134
I'm the tracer assigned to you.

150
00:18:55,168 --> 00:18:57,101
What have you found,
Agent Dockins?

151
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:59,068
He was here.

152
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,380
Very good.

153
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:03,211
Zitchen will be in touch
with further orders.

154
00:19:03,245 --> 00:19:05,005
One more thing, Nicodemus.

155
00:19:05,868 --> 00:19:07,801
Yes, Agent Dockins?

156
00:19:09,009 --> 00:19:11,288
Stay the hell outta my head.

157
00:19:12,081 --> 00:19:14,291
I'll try to do that, sir.

158
00:19:29,513 --> 00:19:31,687
What do you do for a living?

159
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,231
Don't take this the wrong way,

160
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,774
but I don't wanna
get to know you.

161
00:19:49,809 --> 00:19:53,330
I've agreed to take you
to where we're going.

162
00:19:53,364 --> 00:19:55,746
All I want is to know
about my brother.

163
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:58,852
And that's how far you and I go.

164
00:20:18,976 --> 00:20:20,046
I'm getting something.

165
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,013
John, what's going on?

166
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:28,192
Too fast.
It's hard to follow.

167
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,573
John!

168
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,713
Wait...

169
00:20:33,508 --> 00:20:35,026
What's going on?!

170
00:20:35,061 --> 00:20:37,097
The nomad!

171
00:20:39,134 --> 00:20:40,618
John?

172
00:20:45,347 --> 00:20:46,797
Nomad.

173
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,598
Nomad?

174
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,636
No records of that name, sir.

175
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:01,156
Did you get a position?

176
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:03,262
Yes, and there's something else.

177
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,504
What?

178
00:21:04,884 --> 00:21:05,885
A female.

179
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,957
He's traveling with a woman.

180
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,303
A woman?

181
00:21:10,338 --> 00:21:12,685
Find out who she is.

182
00:21:12,719 --> 00:21:15,101
Searching the database
for her records.

183
00:21:18,863 --> 00:21:21,003
Marianna Alvarez.

184
00:21:21,038 --> 00:21:24,041
Searching for traceable
electronic devices.

185
00:21:28,183 --> 00:21:29,426
Got it.

186
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:32,429
I have located an active signal.

187
00:21:33,982 --> 00:21:36,571
Notify Dockins immediately.

188
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:46,857
Understood.

189
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,079
Here.

190
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,504
So what did you mean back there?

191
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:14,988
Mean by what?

192
00:22:15,817 --> 00:22:17,128
Nomad.

193
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,961
I only remember parts of it.

194
00:22:27,518 --> 00:22:30,176
- What?
- You don't trust me, do you?

195
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:33,490
Why should I?

196
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:36,355
For all I know,
you took my brother

197
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:38,667
and you're trying to
do the same to me.

198
00:22:40,462 --> 00:22:42,637
So don't cross me, John.

199
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,571
If that's even your real name.

200
00:23:04,037 --> 00:23:05,763
Who are you?

201
00:23:22,884 --> 00:23:23,884
Oh!

202
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:29,442
Yeah, no, no, no.
Everything's okay.

203
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:30,581
I'm just saying...

204
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:33,204
if you don't hear
from me tomorrow, then...

205
00:23:33,239 --> 00:23:34,827
What are you doing?

206
00:23:35,862 --> 00:23:37,657
She has to go.

207
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:43,836
The hell was that?!

208
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,737
Hey, where are you going now?

209
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,847
What are you doing?!

210
00:23:57,263 --> 00:23:59,714
That is part of my car!

211
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,751
What are you doing?!

212
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:05,927
Okay, that's it.

213
00:24:11,104 --> 00:24:14,487
They can trace us through
your car's GPS computer

214
00:24:14,522 --> 00:24:16,489
and your cell phone!

215
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:17,801
Who, John?
Who can?

216
00:24:17,835 --> 00:24:20,562
I don't know, but I know
they're looking for us.

217
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:25,325
It wasn't safe.
I was trying to protect us.

218
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,776
Marianna, please don't
leave me here.

219
00:24:31,504 --> 00:24:32,504
Look...

220
00:24:33,195 --> 00:24:35,922
I will help you
find your brother.

221
00:24:35,957 --> 00:24:37,752
I promise.

222
00:24:38,856 --> 00:24:41,549
But I can't do it without you.

223
00:26:34,696 --> 00:26:36,802
What's this about?

224
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,182
Ma'am, I'm a federal officer.

225
00:26:38,217 --> 00:26:40,564
I need you to step away
from your vehicle.

226
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,842
How do I know
that badge is real?

227
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,572
Ma'am, it is of the utmost
importance I speak with you.

228
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,470
You're in a grave amount
of danger.

229
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:55,165
All right, I'll hear
what you have to say.

230
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:58,478
What kind of danger?

231
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,278
The man you're traveling with

232
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:07,108
is a fugitive of the law.

233
00:27:07,142 --> 00:27:08,937
He escaped a federal facility
last night,

234
00:27:08,972 --> 00:27:11,768
and I've been tracking him
ever since.

235
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:13,114
John!

236
00:27:13,148 --> 00:27:17,152
He's one of them
You must save her!

237
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:19,223
What was his crime?

238
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,915
His crime?

239
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:22,536
Well...

240
00:27:23,331 --> 00:27:26,541
he's about to commit
a murder/suicide.

241
00:27:26,575 --> 00:27:27,575
Ah!

242
00:27:31,408 --> 00:27:32,408
Hey!

243
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,764
John!

244
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:16,315
Hello, sir.

245
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:19,939
I understand
we have a major problem.

246
00:28:19,974 --> 00:28:22,459
This is a very bad situation,
Zitchen!

247
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,911
Yes, sir, I am well aware
of the gravity of the situation.

248
00:28:25,945 --> 00:28:27,740
The council is not happy.

249
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:30,950
Your man has been compromised
for over 14 hours!

250
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,815
You kept us in the dark and
didn't say anything to anyone.

251
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,403
Yes, yes, of course.

252
00:28:35,437 --> 00:28:38,199
I apologize for not making
the council aware sooner.

253
00:28:38,233 --> 00:28:39,890
Burn the site
and everyone in it!

254
00:28:39,925 --> 00:28:41,927
Give me another 18 hours.

255
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:43,652
I can handle this remotely.

256
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:44,802
Using the current splinter cell.

257
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,966
We do not need to burn
the unit or the site.

258
00:28:47,001 --> 00:28:48,174
Now, you listen to me.

259
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:51,626
We've been working on this deal
for 50 years!

260
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,017
I'm not gonna see it
come to nothing!

261
00:28:53,041 --> 00:28:56,113
I understand that
the covenant is still vey new

262
00:28:56,148 --> 00:28:58,944
and that they have not fully
delivered on their end yet.

263
00:28:58,978 --> 00:29:00,877
Who do you think
they're gonna go to next?

264
00:29:00,911 --> 00:29:03,293
Yes, I am aware that they
will take this deal

265
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:05,813
to the Russians
or the Chinese next.

266
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,297
Then handle it!

267
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,886
Okay, sir, yes.
I'll handle it.

268
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,509
The covenant will not
be compromised.

269
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:14,338
Don't screw this up, Zitchen.

270
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:17,445
Yes, sir, the problem will
be handled within hours.

271
00:29:17,479 --> 00:29:19,792
Good.
Take care of it.

272
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:21,138
Thank you, sir.

273
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,175
Thank you.

274
00:29:40,709 --> 00:29:41,469
What?

275
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:42,919
Sir...

276
00:29:42,953 --> 00:29:45,335
there's been a development.

277
00:29:48,717 --> 00:29:50,650
John! John!

278
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:53,205
John!
John, stay with me!

279
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,965
I'm gonna get you
to the nearest hospital.

280
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,071
No. No, they'll find us there.

281
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:59,245
Is-is there anyplace else?

282
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,317
Curtis! Curtis. Curtis.
He doesn't live far from here.

283
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:03,456
He can help you.

284
00:30:03,491 --> 00:30:04,941
They'll find us.

285
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:07,460
Who will find us, John?!

286
00:30:07,495 --> 00:30:08,979
Tracers.

287
00:30:12,672 --> 00:30:14,053
John!

288
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:15,814
John!

289
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,101
Sir...

290
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:30,207
Officer, are you all right?

291
00:30:37,352 --> 00:30:38,906
Where am I?

292
00:30:39,976 --> 00:30:42,254
Y-you're in the middle
of nowhere, sir.

293
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:46,016
Looks like you got hit
in the face with a rock.

294
00:30:46,051 --> 00:30:47,984
What do you remember?

295
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:50,676
Waking up this morning
and having a drink.

296
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,506
That's about it.

297
00:30:57,476 --> 00:30:59,305
Who are you?

298
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,617
I'm Brad.

299
00:31:00,651 --> 00:31:02,239
What's your name, sir?

300
00:31:02,274 --> 00:31:04,172
Dockins.

301
00:31:04,207 --> 00:31:05,242
Okay.

302
00:31:05,277 --> 00:31:08,936
Well, Dockins, my wife and I
were driving by

303
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,396
and we thought you might
need some help.

304
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,078
Looks like you got messed up
pretty bad.

305
00:31:13,112 --> 00:31:15,287
Oh, and I found these.

306
00:31:17,841 --> 00:31:19,981
Those don't look like mine.

307
00:31:34,962 --> 00:31:36,653
It's loaded.

308
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:40,691
W-want me to call you
an ambulance, sir?

309
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,249
I think that's-that's
coming from your pocket.

310
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:26,634
Curtis?

311
00:32:28,015 --> 00:32:29,361
Curtis.
- Marianna.

312
00:32:29,395 --> 00:32:30,855
My friend's been shot.
He needs your help.

313
00:32:30,879 --> 00:32:32,295
Show me.

314
00:32:40,268 --> 00:32:42,236
Is he gonna be okay?

315
00:32:43,064 --> 00:32:44,652
He's lost a lot of blood...

316
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:49,484
but none of his vital organs
are damaged.

317
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,176
He's pretty lucky.

318
00:32:55,525 --> 00:32:56,525
So...

319
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:59,598
what have you gotten
yourself into, Marianna?

320
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:02,911
I cannot talk about it with you.

321
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:04,603
It's better that way.

322
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,571
C'mon. What's wrong?

323
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,888
Curtis, you used to work
for the military

324
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:16,028
before you opened
your practice, right?

325
00:33:16,063 --> 00:33:17,685
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

326
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:19,273
Why?

327
00:33:19,307 --> 00:33:21,275
Um, in your time there

328
00:33:21,309 --> 00:33:25,244
did you ever hear of anything
called tracers?

329
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:34,081
Where did you hear that word?

330
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,117
He said it in the car

331
00:33:36,152 --> 00:33:38,464
before he passed out.

332
00:33:38,499 --> 00:33:39,845
Marianna...

333
00:33:41,605 --> 00:33:44,815
I don't know what you've
gotten yourself into...

334
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,231
I mean, if this is true,

335
00:33:46,265 --> 00:33:48,095
you're dealing with levels
of classified ops

336
00:33:48,129 --> 00:33:51,650
that not even the president
is cleared for.

337
00:33:51,684 --> 00:33:53,376
What do you mean?

338
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,207
There were rumors
about a black ops division...

339
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,967
psychic soldiers.

340
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:00,486
They're called tracers.

341
00:34:00,521 --> 00:34:02,937
They can remote view
from anywhere in the world.

342
00:34:02,971 --> 00:34:04,456
They get inside your head,

343
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:06,803
they get any information
they want:

344
00:34:06,837 --> 00:34:09,012
location, data, intel,

345
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,772
you name it.

346
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:12,188
How is that possible.

347
00:34:12,222 --> 00:34:13,844
How's anything possible?

348
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:17,572
How's flight possible?
Submarines? Atom bombs?

349
00:34:17,607 --> 00:34:19,229
Anything the human mind
can conceive of,

350
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,956
it's just a matter of time.

351
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:24,269
That's not all of it.

352
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:27,927
These tracers can elect to
operate from a remote location,

353
00:34:27,962 --> 00:34:29,895
where there's
minimum interference.

354
00:34:29,929 --> 00:34:33,485
It's the guys on the ground
that you have to watch out for.

355
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:35,073
Who are they?

356
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,798
Ultras.

357
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,215
They're programmed assassins.

358
00:34:39,249 --> 00:34:41,976
They kill and they
don't remember anything.

359
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:43,495
How?

360
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,361
They take a subject...

361
00:34:47,395 --> 00:34:50,191
They torture them until
the point of mental fracture.

362
00:34:50,226 --> 00:34:52,538
Two minds exist:
one trained as an assassin,

363
00:34:52,573 --> 00:34:55,369
totally controlled
by a puppet master...

364
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:00,063
Look, I...

365
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,134
I can't do this.
I can't have him here.

366
00:35:02,169 --> 00:35:05,241
I'm sorry.
- Yeah, I understand.

367
00:35:05,275 --> 00:35:07,174
Um...
- Here.

368
00:35:08,036 --> 00:35:10,384
Give him these for the pain,
okay?

369
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,388
Thank you, Curtis.

370
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,640
She knows.

371
00:36:01,883 --> 00:36:03,368
Can I help you?

372
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:21,213
Why have you left us,
Christopher?

373
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:22,283
Who are you?

374
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:23,698
You don't remember me,

375
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:27,288
after all the years
working hand-in-hand?

376
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:30,429
Christopher, it's I, Laleeth.

377
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:33,052
I'm right behind you.

378
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:40,853
Why have you left us,
Christopher?

379
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,788
Christopher?

380
00:36:44,823 --> 00:36:47,032
Is that my real name?

381
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:48,309
Yes.

382
00:36:50,415 --> 00:36:52,417
Who am I to you?

383
00:36:52,451 --> 00:36:55,523
A friend, and a liaison.

384
00:36:55,558 --> 00:36:57,594
The emissary for your leaders

385
00:36:57,629 --> 00:37:00,183
as I am the emissary for mine.

386
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,634
We have worked together
for years,

387
00:37:02,668 --> 00:37:03,980
you and I.

388
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,292
How is it that I see you now?

389
00:37:05,326 --> 00:37:06,810
How is that possible?

390
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:09,848
The genetic infusion
that you received from us.

391
00:37:11,194 --> 00:37:13,645
You don't remember that either?

392
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:15,854
We shared with you
our telepathic gift

393
00:37:15,888 --> 00:37:19,789
so that you could communicate
our wishes with your masters.

394
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:22,895
This is how you and I
are speaking together now.

395
00:37:25,415 --> 00:37:28,798
Come back, Christopher.
Explain yourself.

396
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:33,630
All will be forgiven.

397
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,025
You're not human, are you?

398
00:37:50,751 --> 00:37:52,373
No...

399
00:37:52,408 --> 00:37:54,755
We are visitors here.

400
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,412
You know that.

401
00:37:59,829 --> 00:38:01,658
Tell me, John...

402
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:04,730
What is nomad?

403
00:38:06,939 --> 00:38:08,044
I don't know.

404
00:38:08,078 --> 00:38:10,218
Tell her nothing, John!

405
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:12,738
She is your enemy!

406
00:38:12,773 --> 00:38:14,222
Stay back!

407
00:38:17,156 --> 00:38:19,987
You will be hunted down
and executed.

408
00:38:20,021 --> 00:38:22,300
Nothing will stand in our way!

409
00:38:22,334 --> 00:38:24,405
No... No!

410
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,821
No!

411
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:28,651
No!

412
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:29,962
No!

413
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,662
Where am I? Where...
- It's all right.

414
00:38:39,696 --> 00:38:42,147
It's all right.
We're in a motel.

415
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:43,390
You're safe.

416
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:44,874
You got shot.

417
00:38:49,775 --> 00:38:50,845
It's okay.

418
00:39:12,177 --> 00:39:13,281
What's the matter?

419
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:22,221
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

420
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:24,741
Come on.

421
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:30,126
I just keep thinking about
the last time I saw my brother.

422
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,371
I didn't say "I love you" or-
or anything like that.

423
00:39:33,405 --> 00:39:35,511
I wasn't even nice to him.

424
00:39:37,029 --> 00:39:39,687
We were just fighting about
the stupidest thing.

425
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:41,827
It didn't even matter.

426
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:46,487
I was just...
having a really bad day,

427
00:39:46,522 --> 00:39:47,902
and I just took it out on him.

428
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,529
I just didn't think it was the last
time I would see him, you know?

429
00:39:53,563 --> 00:39:55,979
That won't be the last time
you see him.

430
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:58,879
You have to believe that.

431
00:40:03,746 --> 00:40:05,748
What were you fighting about?

432
00:40:08,371 --> 00:40:10,200
He forgot my birthday...

433
00:40:10,235 --> 00:40:12,789
but he was busy.

434
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:14,895
It doesn't matter.

435
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:18,968
I don't even know
how I got so mad.

436
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:20,832
Ah, so stupid.

437
00:40:26,285 --> 00:40:28,149
Well, happy birthday.

438
00:40:28,184 --> 00:40:29,910
Thank you.

439
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,402
I heard him again.

440
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,990
Nomad.

441
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:43,371
When?

442
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:47,099
When I was dreaming.

443
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:51,518
He warned me about this woman
who wanted me to go back.

444
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:55,383
Then I started
remembering things.

445
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:57,178
What do you remember, John?

446
00:40:59,111 --> 00:41:01,217
I work for the government.

447
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:03,288
I was some sort of...

448
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:04,979
liaison.

449
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:06,291
To who?

450
00:41:07,154 --> 00:41:08,914
Not to who...

451
00:41:08,949 --> 00:41:10,537
to what.

452
00:41:15,956 --> 00:41:18,130
I don't expect you
to believe me.

453
00:41:23,377 --> 00:41:25,068
John, I believe you.

454
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,996
What's wrong?

455
00:41:56,997 --> 00:41:57,791
My wound.

456
00:41:57,825 --> 00:42:00,310
Sorry.

457
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:22,298
What?

458
00:42:22,332 --> 00:42:25,508
They found you.
You only have minutes!

459
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:26,785
Who is this?

460
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,167
A friend.
You can call me Rook.

461
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:32,032
You have to get out of there.
Now!

462
00:42:32,066 --> 00:42:33,481
We have to go.

463
00:44:22,729 --> 00:44:24,040
Yes, Agent Dockins?

464
00:44:24,075 --> 00:44:26,733
There's nobody here.
Your intel was wrong.

465
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:31,185
Do not fail me again.

466
00:44:52,655 --> 00:44:54,519
Why are you following us?

467
00:44:55,382 --> 00:44:56,452
- I...
- Not fast enough!

468
00:44:56,486 --> 00:44:58,109
Why are you trying to kill us?

469
00:44:58,143 --> 00:45:00,812
I don't know! I was just told to
find two targets and eliminate them.

470
00:45:00,836 --> 00:45:03,114
I don't know anything about it.

471
00:45:03,148 --> 00:45:04,391
Who sent you?

472
00:45:04,425 --> 00:45:05,564
Zitchen.

473
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,635
A man named Zitchen.

474
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:09,016
Thanks.

475
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:26,482
Are they dead?

476
00:45:27,932 --> 00:45:29,381
You tell me, Zitchen.

477
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,802
Christopher, is that you?

478
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:38,494
Why are you trying to kill me?

479
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:42,774
I'm sure that's no mystery
after what you've done, my boy.

480
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:44,431
I'm not your boy.

481
00:45:44,983 --> 00:45:47,503
Is my soldier dead?

482
00:45:50,299 --> 00:45:51,472
Almost.

483
00:45:51,507 --> 00:45:53,854
We will find you, John.

484
00:45:53,889 --> 00:45:58,479
There's nowhere on this planet
my tracers can't see.

485
00:45:58,514 --> 00:46:00,240
Tell me one thing, John.

486
00:46:01,586 --> 00:46:03,519
Tell me about...

487
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,141
Nomad.

488
00:46:05,176 --> 00:46:07,488
I'm gonna stop you, Zitchen.

489
00:46:07,523 --> 00:46:09,559
I'm gonna stop all of you.

490
00:46:31,478 --> 00:46:32,720
What is it, John?

491
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:34,826
I know this place.

492
00:46:37,001 --> 00:46:39,072
T-take this exit here.

493
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:42,316
Here.

494
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:56,468
Where are we, John?

495
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:15,971
Maybe nobody's home.

496
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:18,283
Let's just go.

497
00:47:23,357 --> 00:47:24,980
Can I help you?

498
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:31,055
John?

499
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:33,643
Hey, sis.

500
00:48:14,167 --> 00:48:17,964
I expected more from you,
Agent Dockins.

501
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:19,931
By failing to eliminate
the target,

502
00:48:19,966 --> 00:48:22,071
you may have cost us
all our lives

503
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:24,522
and compromised everything
I've worked for

504
00:48:24,556 --> 00:48:28,181
the past 30 years.

505
00:48:29,630 --> 00:48:31,218
I could still kill 'em.

506
00:48:32,116 --> 00:48:34,394
Just give me one more chance.

507
00:48:44,369 --> 00:48:45,508
Fine.

508
00:49:01,766 --> 00:49:04,734
You can't kill me, boy.

509
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:07,737
I programmed you.
I'm your creator.

510
00:49:14,848 --> 00:49:16,781
I am your god.

511
00:49:40,046 --> 00:49:42,013
Find them.

512
00:49:42,048 --> 00:49:44,119
You have one more chance,
Agent Dockins.

513
00:49:44,153 --> 00:49:46,293
Don't fail me again.

514
00:49:46,914 --> 00:49:48,502
Now go.

515
00:49:54,129 --> 00:49:56,441
I can't believe you're here.

516
00:49:57,822 --> 00:50:01,412
You don't know how long Mom
and Dad waited for this day.

517
00:50:16,599 --> 00:50:18,843
Mom, two years ago.

518
00:50:18,877 --> 00:50:20,707
Dad, a year after.

519
00:50:23,468 --> 00:50:26,747
I don't think Dad could go on
living with both of you gone.

520
00:50:29,474 --> 00:50:30,855
Stephanie...

521
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:33,720
who was I?

522
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:36,309
What happened to me?

523
00:50:37,724 --> 00:50:40,278
You don't remember?

524
00:50:43,316 --> 00:50:44,731
You don't remember anything?

525
00:50:44,765 --> 00:50:47,147
He only has bits and pieces.

526
00:50:47,182 --> 00:50:49,080
He remembered this place,

527
00:50:49,115 --> 00:50:51,634
and he remembered you, but...

528
00:50:51,669 --> 00:50:54,534
I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
who are you again?

529
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:59,780
We can't explain right now.

530
00:51:05,752 --> 00:51:07,478
Well, um...

531
00:51:08,410 --> 00:51:10,860
You were in the Air Force.

532
00:51:10,895 --> 00:51:12,586
A pilot.

533
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,005
Mom and Dad's pride and joy.

534
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,973
My big brother.

535
00:51:20,007 --> 00:51:21,664
My hero.

536
00:51:29,569 --> 00:51:31,053
You were 24

537
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,917
when you disappeared.

538
00:51:33,918 --> 00:51:35,747
You were on a mission...

539
00:51:35,782 --> 00:51:38,681
to the Middle East, but you
couldn't talk much about it.

540
00:51:40,752 --> 00:51:44,204
Six months later they said
your plane went down,

541
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:46,241
but that no...

542
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:49,623
body or wreckage
was ever found.

543
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,252
Mom wanted to have a funeral...

544
00:51:57,286 --> 00:51:59,150
for closure...

545
00:52:02,188 --> 00:52:04,535
but Dad wouldn't allow it.

546
00:52:06,226 --> 00:52:08,711
He said you were alive.

547
00:52:09,988 --> 00:52:13,060
He said that-that he could...

548
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,786
feel you out there somewhere

549
00:52:14,821 --> 00:52:16,788
trying to get back to us.

550
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:20,344
He believed that
'til the day he died.

551
00:52:21,552 --> 00:52:24,417
He even gave me this house...

552
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:27,489
afterward, and told me
to wait for you.

553
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:35,290
Where have you been, John?

554
00:52:35,324 --> 00:52:37,706
Why come back now?

555
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:39,811
I don't know.

556
00:52:41,503 --> 00:52:44,195
I don't know where I've been...

557
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,817
or what happened to me...

558
00:52:47,233 --> 00:52:49,269
but if I could've
made it home...

559
00:52:50,236 --> 00:52:51,858
I would have.

560
00:53:06,493 --> 00:53:07,667
Hello?

561
00:53:12,258 --> 00:53:13,914
It's for you.

562
00:53:23,303 --> 00:53:24,960
Who is this?

563
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:26,272
It's Rook.

564
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:28,066
What are you doing there?

565
00:53:28,101 --> 00:53:30,241
John, they're underway.

566
00:53:30,276 --> 00:53:31,863
My sister?

567
00:53:31,898 --> 00:53:33,106
Aw, man.

568
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:35,246
What were you thinking?!

569
00:53:35,281 --> 00:53:36,592
All right,

570
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:38,767
Al right, I'll try
to deflect 'em.

571
00:53:38,801 --> 00:53:40,424
I'm not sure if I can.

572
00:53:40,458 --> 00:53:43,289
Leave right now, John!

573
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:47,707
What's going on?

574
00:53:49,674 --> 00:53:51,262
I will come back.

575
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:52,815
I'll explain then.

576
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:58,027
I don't understand.

577
00:53:58,062 --> 00:53:59,408
I'm sorry.

578
00:54:00,685 --> 00:54:02,411
John, wait!

579
00:54:05,794 --> 00:54:07,071
You're an uncle.

580
00:54:09,970 --> 00:54:11,696
I love you, sis.

581
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,077
I love you too.

582
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:14,906
Come on.
We gotta go.

583
00:54:14,941 --> 00:54:16,080
Sorry.

584
00:54:35,410 --> 00:54:37,550
I'm getting a house number.

585
00:54:45,005 --> 00:54:46,005
Oh!

586
00:55:07,511 --> 00:55:09,167
The image is changing.

587
00:55:09,202 --> 00:55:11,446
It's scrambling somehow.

588
00:55:14,345 --> 00:55:15,760
Highway...

589
00:55:16,485 --> 00:55:18,142
They're getting on the highway.

590
00:55:25,736 --> 00:55:28,048
Fuck it.
Just get to the highway now.

591
00:55:28,083 --> 00:55:29,533
Right now!

592
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:31,673
We're losing time!

593
00:56:10,677 --> 00:56:11,989
Marianna!

594
00:56:12,023 --> 00:56:13,370
Wait!

595
00:56:13,404 --> 00:56:15,406
Where are you going?!

596
00:56:16,476 --> 00:56:19,824
You're one of them!
You took my brother!

597
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:22,344
You've been part of this
the whole time!

598
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:25,209
I trusted you, John!

599
00:56:25,243 --> 00:56:26,624
Stop!

600
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:29,524
Stop!

601
00:56:30,973 --> 00:56:33,320
You said it right there
in the car!

602
00:56:33,355 --> 00:56:35,668
You knew all about him!

603
00:56:36,289 --> 00:56:39,016
I trusted you, John!

604
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,052
He's dead, isn't he?

605
00:56:41,950 --> 00:56:44,124
I-I don't know.

606
00:56:44,159 --> 00:56:45,712
I don't understand all of it.

607
00:56:45,747 --> 00:56:47,438
You're just gonna
have to believe...

608
00:56:47,473 --> 00:56:48,543
I'm done believing you!

609
00:56:48,577 --> 00:56:50,855
You lied to me!

610
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,201
Run!

611
00:57:11,393 --> 00:57:12,912
Marianna!

612
00:57:49,155 --> 00:57:50,155
Stop!

613
00:57:54,125 --> 00:57:56,127
Don't do this, Dockins.

614
00:57:56,162 --> 00:57:57,335
You're not a killer.

615
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,027
I'm not a what?

616
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:03,514
What do you think I've
been doin' the last 24 hours?

617
00:58:03,549 --> 00:58:04,998
Stock trades?

618
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:08,554
I've been killing
every single person

619
00:58:08,588 --> 00:58:10,694
you've come in contact with.

620
00:58:10,728 --> 00:58:14,042
And now, I'm aiming
straight for the source.

621
00:58:14,076 --> 00:58:17,010
You do a lot of talking
for an ultra.

622
00:58:17,045 --> 00:58:18,633
You're stalling.

623
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,842
You think you know a lot,
don't you?

624
00:58:20,876 --> 00:58:22,119
I do.

625
00:58:22,153 --> 00:58:25,398
I was there when Zitchen
programmed you.

626
00:58:25,432 --> 00:58:29,091
Your name is Thomas Dockins

627
00:58:29,126 --> 00:58:30,610
You're an ex Navy SEAL.

628
00:58:30,645 --> 00:58:34,683
You have a wife.
You have a daughter.

629
00:58:34,718 --> 00:58:36,754
What are you talking about?

630
00:58:36,789 --> 00:58:38,963
You're not a killer.

631
00:58:38,998 --> 00:58:40,724
You're a father.

632
00:58:40,758 --> 00:58:42,311
Think about Katie.

633
00:58:42,346 --> 00:58:43,623
You shut up!

634
00:58:43,658 --> 00:58:45,487
You don't mention her name!

635
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:47,765
You'll only get one shot off!

636
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:51,355
You're too far away
for a guaranteed head shot.

637
00:58:51,389 --> 00:58:52,459
Fine.

638
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:53,909
What are you suggesting?

639
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:55,462
Let her go.

640
00:58:55,497 --> 00:58:57,326
I'll go 'round the bend.

641
00:58:57,361 --> 00:59:01,054
And we settle this man to man.

642
00:59:02,435 --> 00:59:03,435
Go.

643
00:59:04,368 --> 00:59:06,715
I'll come back for you,
Marianna.

644
00:59:11,478 --> 00:59:13,964
I'll be back for you next.

645
01:00:28,003 --> 01:00:30,281
You don't have to do this,
Thomas.

646
01:00:30,316 --> 01:00:31,420
You can walk away.

647
01:00:31,455 --> 01:00:34,251
Why should I listen to a man
I have orders to kill?

648
01:00:35,977 --> 01:00:38,738
Because I used to work
for the Council.

649
01:00:38,773 --> 01:00:40,809
I did terrible things,

650
01:00:40,844 --> 01:00:42,604
but I walked away.

651
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,295
Make the right choice, Thomas.

652
01:00:44,330 --> 01:00:47,229
There is no right or wrong,
there's only the mission!

653
01:00:47,264 --> 01:00:48,472
You're wrong, Thomas!

654
01:00:59,276 --> 01:01:01,588
Think about your daughter!

655
01:01:01,623 --> 01:01:03,314
Think about Katie!

656
01:01:03,349 --> 01:01:05,627
Don't you mention her again!

657
01:01:40,869 --> 01:01:43,700
Am I close enough
for a head shot now, Eckles?

658
01:01:43,734 --> 01:01:46,116
You forgot about one thing.

659
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:47,531
And what's that?

660
01:01:47,565 --> 01:01:49,982
Aurora.

661
01:01:50,016 --> 01:01:51,431
Respond.

662
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,640
Fight it, Thomas.

663
01:01:53,675 --> 01:01:55,159
Fight it!

664
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:45,900
Stop the car!

665
01:02:45,934 --> 01:02:47,694
Stop the car!

666
01:02:47,729 --> 01:02:48,695
You were hit in the head.

667
01:02:48,730 --> 01:02:50,732
- Stop the car!
- Relax.

668
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:52,251
I know I was hit in the head!

669
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:53,735
I also know that you
took my brother!

670
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,013
Let me out!
Let me out!

671
01:02:56,048 --> 01:02:58,913
- Stop. Look at me!
- Stop the car!

672
01:03:00,846 --> 01:03:03,503
Look at me.
Marianna, stop! Stop!

673
01:03:03,538 --> 01:03:06,023
Stop!
Look at me! Stop!

674
01:03:06,058 --> 01:03:09,337
I don't understand
or remember everything.

675
01:03:09,371 --> 01:03:12,029
But deep down inside,
I know I'm a good person.

676
01:03:12,064 --> 01:03:13,824
And whatever happened
to your brother,

677
01:03:13,859 --> 01:03:16,413
I'm here, because I wanna
make that right.

678
01:03:16,447 --> 01:03:18,070
We're only a few hours away.

679
01:03:18,104 --> 01:03:21,004
I don't know why but I have
to know about this Nomad.

680
01:03:21,038 --> 01:03:23,420
He's the answer to all this.

681
01:03:24,973 --> 01:03:29,115
If I was such a bad person, why not
just leave you out in the desert?

682
01:03:29,150 --> 01:03:31,911
Just give me a few more hours...

683
01:03:31,946 --> 01:03:34,362
and you'll never have to
see me again.

684
01:03:34,396 --> 01:03:38,090
And you will have all the answers
you're seeking about your brother.

685
01:03:43,716 --> 01:03:45,062
Fine.

686
01:03:48,652 --> 01:03:51,137
Is he dead?
Dockins?

687
01:03:51,172 --> 01:03:52,414
Yeah.

688
01:03:54,244 --> 01:03:55,521
Good.

689
01:03:57,764 --> 01:03:59,421
What do you have for me?

690
01:04:00,802 --> 01:04:02,562
Sir...

691
01:04:05,703 --> 01:04:08,223
Our asset has been compromised.

692
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:13,608
And the target?
What about Eckles?

693
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:15,403
He and the woman...

694
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,475
they're still on the move,
sir.

695
01:04:19,752 --> 01:04:21,650
Track them.

696
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:48,298
I've never seen LA before.

697
01:04:48,332 --> 01:04:49,126
Have you?

698
01:04:49,161 --> 01:04:52,095
I don't know.
I can't be sure.

699
01:04:59,171 --> 01:05:00,966
Where are you going?

700
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,829
We have to go to Santa Monica.

701
01:05:02,864 --> 01:05:04,383
Trust me.

702
01:05:04,417 --> 01:05:06,350
I saw something.

703
01:05:09,802 --> 01:05:11,148
There.

704
01:05:15,635 --> 01:05:17,051
What are we doing here?

705
01:05:17,085 --> 01:05:19,053
Just trust me.

706
01:05:26,853 --> 01:05:28,372
Rook.

707
01:05:29,546 --> 01:05:31,479
You just killed me.

708
01:05:34,758 --> 01:05:36,415
Come on in.

709
01:05:39,004 --> 01:05:40,522
Until you, John...

710
01:05:41,627 --> 01:05:45,182
I was Zitchen's
only other runaway.

711
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:47,805
And that was 25 years ago.

712
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:52,189
I was the strongest tracer
that had yet been developed.

713
01:05:52,224 --> 01:05:55,986
I was used
for all sorts of things.

714
01:05:56,021 --> 01:05:57,539
Like you.

715
01:05:57,574 --> 01:06:00,473
And then I started
figuring things out.

716
01:06:01,854 --> 01:06:03,511
And I started to develop...

717
01:06:03,545 --> 01:06:07,894
a slow but steady
moral tumor inside me.

718
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:10,380
I just couldn't
take the guilt anymore.

719
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:14,142
I had to make things right.

720
01:06:14,867 --> 01:06:17,042
How did you escape?

721
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:20,562
I faked my own death.

722
01:06:20,597 --> 01:06:22,219
Like you,

723
01:06:22,254 --> 01:06:25,015
I started to use my abilities

724
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:27,742
to dampen my memory,

725
01:06:27,776 --> 01:06:31,194
so the tracers
couldn't track me.

726
01:06:31,228 --> 01:06:33,161
I left clues behind

727
01:06:33,196 --> 01:06:34,956
to a safe house

728
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,889
that I already had set up.

729
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:39,064
They haven't figured it out yet.

730
01:06:39,098 --> 01:06:41,894
But there is a way
to dampen the location.

731
01:06:41,928 --> 01:06:44,138
Create a blind spot,

732
01:06:44,172 --> 01:06:46,485
so when they peek in,

733
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:48,452
they can't see you.

734
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:50,109
And after a while,

735
01:06:50,144 --> 01:06:52,525
they stop looking.

736
01:06:54,424 --> 01:06:57,599
Rook, do you know anything
about my brother?

737
01:06:59,670 --> 01:07:01,086
Sorry.

738
01:07:01,741 --> 01:07:04,020
That was after my time.

739
01:07:04,710 --> 01:07:06,436
But he does.

740
01:07:07,747 --> 01:07:09,715
It's all right here.

741
01:07:10,474 --> 01:07:13,201
His memory's a little dampened.

742
01:07:13,236 --> 01:07:16,066
But it'll all come back to him.

743
01:07:16,101 --> 01:07:19,725
Then you'll have the info
that you need.

744
01:07:19,759 --> 01:07:22,038
And how long will that take?

745
01:07:22,072 --> 01:07:23,798
It's hard to say.

746
01:07:25,696 --> 01:07:27,629
Why are you helping us?

747
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:31,840
Because I wan an stop them too,
John.

748
01:07:33,118 --> 01:07:35,534
I'm only one man.

749
01:07:43,852 --> 01:07:46,510
All I can do is sit and watch,

750
01:07:46,545 --> 01:07:49,168
but when I saw
you were escaping,

751
01:07:49,203 --> 01:07:54,656
that's the moment I've been
waiting for for 25 years.

752
01:07:54,691 --> 01:07:56,106
Rook...

753
01:07:56,141 --> 01:07:58,143
what is Nomad?

754
01:07:58,177 --> 01:08:00,076
I don't know.

755
01:08:01,146 --> 01:08:03,320
But you do.

756
01:08:03,355 --> 01:08:06,634
And you gotta find them
at all costs.

757
01:08:06,668 --> 01:08:10,327
Because I believe he's the
only one that can help us.

758
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:13,744
Because what I see them doin'...

759
01:08:14,952 --> 01:08:17,127
will be the end of us all.

760
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,547
Rook, what is it?

761
01:08:23,582 --> 01:08:24,893
What do you see?

762
01:08:26,861 --> 01:08:29,139
That's all I can tell you now.

763
01:08:30,727 --> 01:08:32,591
My time is up.

764
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,112
I hope I haven't failed you.

765
01:09:00,412 --> 01:09:02,931
You tried to betray us,
Christopher,

766
01:09:02,966 --> 01:09:04,830
but you failed.

767
01:09:06,003 --> 01:09:07,798
If I failed...

768
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:10,836
then someone else
will rise up

769
01:09:10,870 --> 01:09:12,217
to stop you.

770
01:09:12,251 --> 01:09:14,736
You don't understand, do you?

771
01:09:14,771 --> 01:09:17,808
This planet and its people
are ours now.

772
01:09:17,843 --> 01:09:19,327
No one will stand in our way.

773
01:09:19,362 --> 01:09:21,674
Not even your precious Nomad.

774
01:09:23,331 --> 01:09:27,024
I remember everything now,
Laleeth.

775
01:09:27,059 --> 01:09:29,682
Do you wanna know about Nomad?

776
01:09:30,718 --> 01:09:32,202
Traitor.

777
01:09:32,237 --> 01:09:34,342
Wake up and face execution.

778
01:09:34,377 --> 01:09:36,448
We will not
see each other again.

779
01:09:36,482 --> 01:09:39,623
The gift will be given
to another.

780
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,802
John...

781
01:09:45,836 --> 01:09:47,321
Wake up!

782
01:09:49,115 --> 01:09:51,152
John!
- Where are we?

783
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,567
I don't know.

784
01:09:53,706 --> 01:09:55,363
We got trapped.

785
01:10:01,645 --> 01:10:03,026
Can you see?

786
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:04,545
No.

787
01:10:10,033 --> 01:10:11,241
Shh.

788
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:12,898
Shh, quiet.

789
01:10:31,157 --> 01:10:33,608
Welcome back, Christopher.

790
01:10:33,643 --> 01:10:37,612
I no longer go by that name
you gave me, Zitchen.

791
01:10:37,647 --> 01:10:39,718
My name is John.

792
01:10:39,752 --> 01:10:42,755
Christopher... John...

793
01:10:42,790 --> 01:10:46,103
What does it matter
at this point, Eckles?

794
01:10:46,138 --> 01:10:49,555
In a few minutes
you're going to be dead.

795
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,247
Why wait?

796
01:10:55,285 --> 01:10:59,013
I think you know
exactly what I want.

797
01:11:08,954 --> 01:11:11,888
Look at this one.

798
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:15,443
This poor innocent woman.

799
01:11:16,996 --> 01:11:20,276
And now she's going to die
because you brought her into this.

800
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:23,037
That sounds very selfish to me,
Marianna.

801
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,280
Don't you think?

802
01:11:24,314 --> 01:11:26,385
Leave her out of this!

803
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:28,767
Why, John?

804
01:11:28,801 --> 01:11:31,356
Don't you think she's want
to know about her brother

805
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,289
and what you did to him?

806
01:11:33,323 --> 01:11:34,980
Shut up, Zitchen!

807
01:11:35,014 --> 01:11:37,672
This is between you and me.

808
01:11:39,122 --> 01:11:40,848
No, John...

809
01:11:40,882 --> 01:11:42,919
You did this.

810
01:11:46,647 --> 01:11:49,028
Wouldn't you like
to know everything, Marianna?

811
01:11:54,206 --> 01:11:56,277
In the 40's...

812
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:59,349
an alien ship
crashed in Roswell.

813
01:11:59,384 --> 01:12:01,317
Out of that one crash, came...

814
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:06,391
lasers, night vision,
microprocessors.

815
01:12:06,425 --> 01:12:09,532
We were hooked.

816
01:12:10,498 --> 01:12:14,295
You see, the aliens,
they don't talk like us.

817
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:17,022
They use their minds.

818
01:12:17,056 --> 01:12:19,162
And so a human was chosen

819
01:12:19,196 --> 01:12:21,198
and infused with their DNA,

820
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:24,443
giving him
their telepathic gift.

821
01:12:24,478 --> 01:12:28,067
He was our emissary
to their kind.

822
01:12:28,102 --> 01:12:30,967
That man was my father...

823
01:12:31,726 --> 01:12:33,659
and when he finally died,

824
01:12:33,694 --> 01:12:38,008
John here was recruited
to replace him.

825
01:12:38,043 --> 01:12:39,493
John...

826
01:12:39,527 --> 01:12:43,635
negotiated the terms
for our new covenant.

827
01:12:45,430 --> 01:12:47,293
What terms?

828
01:12:47,328 --> 01:12:51,263
This time we wanted
their weapons.

829
01:12:51,297 --> 01:12:53,714
In exchange for what?

830
01:12:53,748 --> 01:12:56,475
Unlimited and
unrestricted access

831
01:12:56,510 --> 01:12:58,753
to the population at large.

832
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:03,620
They could keep them for good.

833
01:13:04,897 --> 01:13:06,865
Mutilate them...

834
01:13:06,899 --> 01:13:09,143
kill them...

835
01:13:09,937 --> 01:13:11,628
We didn't care anymore.

836
01:13:12,767 --> 01:13:16,392
Why would the United States
do something like that?

837
01:13:16,426 --> 01:13:20,292
I don't work for
the United States government.

838
01:13:20,326 --> 01:13:22,328
I work for
the board of directors

839
01:13:22,363 --> 01:13:25,711
that owns and operates
this United States,

840
01:13:25,746 --> 01:13:29,750
along with many other
servile governments.

841
01:13:29,784 --> 01:13:30,751
The Council?

842
01:13:30,785 --> 01:13:32,131
Ah.

843
01:13:32,166 --> 01:13:37,551
This new covenant is what happened
to your brother, Marianna.

844
01:13:37,585 --> 01:13:40,208
And John was part of
the selection process

845
01:13:40,243 --> 01:13:42,107
for specimens.

846
01:13:42,141 --> 01:13:44,627
He practically hand-picked him

847
01:13:44,661 --> 01:13:47,733
out of the masses
for experimentation.

848
01:13:49,494 --> 01:13:51,806
John, is that true?

849
01:13:51,841 --> 01:13:54,775
- Marianna.
- Is that true?!

850
01:13:56,742 --> 01:13:57,950
Yes.

851
01:14:07,477 --> 01:14:09,962
What kind of experiments?

852
01:14:09,997 --> 01:14:12,137
A new species.

853
01:14:12,171 --> 01:14:15,071
Half human, half alien.

854
01:14:15,105 --> 01:14:16,555
And now...

855
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:19,455
tell me, John...

856
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:23,907
the thing
I most want to know.

857
01:14:26,703 --> 01:14:27,946
Nomad.

858
01:14:29,085 --> 01:14:30,845
Go to hell.

859
01:14:31,915 --> 01:14:33,296
You first.

860
01:14:33,330 --> 01:14:35,056
Wait!

861
01:14:37,576 --> 01:14:40,717
I have something to tell you...

862
01:14:40,752 --> 01:14:43,548
but you need to come closer.

863
01:14:47,206 --> 01:14:48,932
Closer.

864
01:14:48,967 --> 01:14:50,278
What are you doing?

865
01:15:01,082 --> 01:15:02,946
Come closer.

866
01:15:10,954 --> 01:15:14,199
You don't ever touch my family!

867
01:19:08,985 --> 01:19:13,507
If you're one of them,
then why are you helping us?

868
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,267
I'm not like them.

869
01:19:15,302 --> 01:19:20,272
I come from a galaxy
far more distant than theirs.

870
01:19:20,307 --> 01:19:22,136
I'm an explorer.

871
01:19:22,171 --> 01:19:25,691
When I came upon your world,
I detected their presence,

872
01:19:25,726 --> 01:19:27,486
and I realized the threat

873
01:19:27,521 --> 01:19:29,799
to your young species.

874
01:19:29,834 --> 01:19:33,527
So I searched the planet
with my mind,

875
01:19:33,561 --> 01:19:35,667
and I connected to one soul

876
01:19:35,701 --> 01:19:38,774
with the knowledge
sufficient to stop them.

877
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:41,293
I knew I had to get to Nomad...

878
01:19:41,328 --> 01:19:43,192
and his ship.

879
01:19:45,263 --> 01:19:47,127
Where is it?

880
01:19:47,161 --> 01:19:49,957
Just there beneath the waves.

881
01:19:52,408 --> 01:19:54,479
Why my brother?

882
01:19:54,513 --> 01:19:56,274
Why him?

883
01:19:57,309 --> 01:19:58,828
The hybrids,

884
01:19:58,863 --> 01:20:01,037
they were highly unstable.

885
01:20:01,072 --> 01:20:02,901
They lacked
a key genetic sequence

886
01:20:02,936 --> 01:20:05,179
that would have
perfected their race.

887
01:20:06,629 --> 01:20:08,148
We called it the grail.

888
01:20:08,182 --> 01:20:11,530
With the grail they
would've created a slave race.

889
01:20:11,565 --> 01:20:14,085
No more need for you humans.

890
01:20:14,119 --> 01:20:17,364
We found that gene
in one person.

891
01:20:17,398 --> 01:20:19,021
Your brother.

892
01:20:22,472 --> 01:20:23,957
It's true.

893
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:27,443
I was on the team
searching for the grail.

894
01:20:27,477 --> 01:20:30,584
But after what I saw
they did to your brother...

895
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,931
I knew I was on
the wrong side,

896
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:34,657
and I had to stop them.

897
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:35,969
Without John,

898
01:20:36,003 --> 01:20:39,973
time would not have been
on your brother's side.

899
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:42,527
I knew I had to
help him find you.

900
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:44,115
That's why I called you.

901
01:20:45,081 --> 01:20:48,982
You were the only one
I could rely on.

902
01:20:52,502 --> 01:20:56,092
And I was the only one
who could help you.

903
01:20:56,127 --> 01:20:59,785
The day I called you, I wrote
those things on my body,

904
01:20:59,820 --> 01:21:01,891
and I dampened my own memory

905
01:21:01,926 --> 01:21:04,376
so they could not
trace us to Nomad.

906
01:21:04,411 --> 01:21:08,104
The day I left,
I had your brother moved.

907
01:21:11,556 --> 01:21:13,454
This is his location.

908
01:21:19,564 --> 01:21:21,462
Is he still alive?

909
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,671
I don't know.

910
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:29,539
He is still alive.

911
01:21:32,577 --> 01:21:34,579
John, thank you!

912
01:21:38,100 --> 01:21:40,447
I will come back for you,
Marianna.

913
01:21:41,724 --> 01:21:43,484
John...

914
01:21:44,589 --> 01:21:46,556
it's time to go.

915
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,551
Carlos. Carlos.

916
01:23:27,588 --> 01:23:29,383
Marianna.

917
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:36,839
Where am I?

918
01:23:36,873 --> 01:23:38,565
You're okay.

919
01:23:38,599 --> 01:23:40,567
You're safe now.

920
01:24:02,416 --> 01:24:03,176
What?

921
01:24:03,210 --> 01:24:04,763
Sir...

922
01:24:05,971 --> 01:24:08,664
A sweep team just found
General Zitchen.

923
01:24:10,390 --> 01:24:11,390
He's dead.

924
01:24:12,771 --> 01:24:17,638
We tried to burn the unit, but
the tracer had already escaped.

925
01:24:17,673 --> 01:24:19,123
Eckles?

926
01:24:19,157 --> 01:24:20,227
Where is he now?

927
01:24:20,262 --> 01:24:21,953
He and the woman got away, sir.

928
01:24:21,987 --> 01:24:26,233
Our satellites detected a spacecraft
launch off the coat of California.

929
01:24:26,268 --> 01:24:28,580
And we think that
that was them, sir.

930
01:24:30,237 --> 01:24:32,377
All right, that's all.

931
01:24:36,450 --> 01:24:37,727
Hey, it's me.

932
01:24:39,591 --> 01:24:41,352
Get the unit ready.

933
01:24:42,007 --> 01:24:43,733
No, no, no, wait a second.

934
01:24:43,768 --> 01:24:45,494
I'm leadin' this one.

935
01:24:46,253 --> 01:24:48,393
I need a ship, too.

936
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:51,224
This is war.
