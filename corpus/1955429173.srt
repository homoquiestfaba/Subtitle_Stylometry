1
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,219
On this special two-hour episode.

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:06,690
Of "Finding bigfoot"...

3
00:00:11,090 --> 00:00:14,259
The team returns
To north carolina,

4
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,629
Where one appalachian family
Has been reporting sightings.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:20,899
On their property
For generations.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,269
And all of you have experienced
Sasquatch activity.

7
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,670
At one time or another?

8
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:33,179
Inundated with reports
At the town-hall meeting...

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:34,549
No!

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,980
Big, glowing eyes.

11
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:39,089
It stood there,
And then swayed back and forth.

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,059
That's only one thing
In this world it could be,

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:42,459
And that's a bigfoot.

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,159
You guys are not Disappointing.

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,290
The team calls for backup.

16
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,130
Hey!

17
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:48,999
Ranae's cousin laura,

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,999
Matt's son leo,

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,199
Cliff's brother rob,

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,400
And bobo's good friend bud.

21
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,609
With friends and family
By their side,

22
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:00,709
They hit the trail,

23
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:06,049
Investigating
Its most isolated sectors,

24
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:08,619
All leading
To a final, epic night.

25
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,250
In the wilds of appalachia.

26
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,389
Yeah!

27
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,729
It's here. Down that way.

28
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,030
Shush.

29
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,630
Listen!

30
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,830
I think I just heard
My first 'squatch.

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,069
It was impossibly large.

32
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,470
It definitely wasn't human.

33
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:35,379
I've been tracking
Sasquatches for 25 years.

34
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,149
These animals,
In fact, are real.

35
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:39,179
I've seen them. They're here.

36
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,819
I'm having
A really difficult time.

37
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,449
Finding an explanation for this.

38
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,290
There's something on the hill!

39
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,630
I do think there's a 'squatch
In these woods.

40
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,599
Aptions by vitacwww.Vitac.Com.

41
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,699
Captions paid for by
Discovery communications.

42
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,769
The team and I are back
In north carolina.

43
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,600
Five years ago,
We did an expedition.

44
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,109
In central north carolina,
Where we got some action.

45
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:08,979
This time, we're in
The western part of the state.

46
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,749
And we're hoping
To get some action here, too.

47
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,079
Out here in the west, you have
The appalachian mountain range,

48
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,480
Which the appalachian trail
Runs through.

49
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:19,050
Sasquatches love
That mountainous terrain.

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,119
And with all the caves
Around here,

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,860
They've got
A lot of places to hide.

52
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,059
Whenever we're
In the appalachian mountains,

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,929
We invariably run into reports
Along the appalachian trail.

54
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,730
The reports
From the appalachians.

55
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:34,239
Date back centuries.

56
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,169
For as long as people have lived
In these mountains,

57
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,379
They've been reporting
Sasquatch sightings.

58
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,279
In fact, we got a call
From a family.

59
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,379
That lives less than a mile
From the appalachian trail.

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,219
And they say
They've been having activity.

61
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,080
And encounters in that family
For generations.

62
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,620
So that's where we're headed.

63
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:57,529
Well, we are back
In north carolina.

64
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,359
And we know
From previous investigations.

65
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,029
In the south
And on the east coast,

66
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:02,499
Probably the number-one
Common denominator.

67
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,469
Has been the a.T...
The appalachian trail.

68
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:07,769
Yeah, so much stuff happens
Along the appalachian trail,

69
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,900
But part of that's because
It's such a long trail.

70
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,409
In starts in georgia
And ends in maine.

71
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,979
A lot of people take months off.

72
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,040
To walk the entire stretch
Of the trail.

73
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:17,109
And some of those people.

74
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,179
Encounter sasquatches
Along the way.

75
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,549
Our area of focus
Here in north carolina.

76
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,519
Is a little bit different
Than some of the other areas.

77
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,889
We've looked into in the south.

78
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,919
<I>I mean, these mountains
Are serious mountains.</I>

79
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,289
They are high. They are steep.

80
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,320
They are rugged.

81
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:31,860
This is great habitat
For sasquatches.

82
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:38,169
And I realized this morning
That it's five years to the day.

83
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,599
That we had
Our first expedition together.

84
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,639
We went with mike green
For the squeaky thermal footage.

85
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,669
That's right.

86
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,190
That wasn't very far
From here, either.

87
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,809
That bigfoot reached out
And just grabbed that candy bar.

88
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,349
And that squeaky footage
Was the first thermal footage,

89
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,620
I'm aware of,
That we agreed was a sasquatch.

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,850
I can't believe it took us
So long to come back here.

91
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,590
Our first expedition
As a team together was here.

92
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:06,059
We had definite 'squatch action
Last time we were here,

93
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,129
And we may even
Have seen a 'squatch.

94
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,029
So, now we're back.
Hopes are high.

95
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,669
I can't believe
It's taken us this long.

96
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,039
To get back here, Honestly.

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,669
I mean, there is so much
Viable habitat.

98
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:17,439
For sasquatches
Here in north carolina.

99
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,609
We could've done.

100
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,939
Five or six different
Expeditions here by now.

101
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,909
It is an outdoor mecca.

102
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,110
There's 600 miles of trails
In one of the nearby forests,

103
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,919
White-water rafting,
A lot of climbing.

104
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,389
There are tons of tourists
And locals outdoors every day.

105
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:35,220
Engaging in various forms
Of recreational activity.

106
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,920
Along the appalachian trail.

107
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,729
Will all these people
Spending time out in the woods,

108
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:42,699
Of course some of them
Are bound to "See" bigfoots.

109
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,570
<I>The question is,
What is they're really seeing?</I>

110
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,069
We have to go look
Into this guy, ernie bradford,

111
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:51,139
And his family.

112
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,709
They've got
This big piece of land.

113
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,539
Backed up right
To the national forest.

114
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,109
And three generations Of them.

115
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,849
Say that Bigfoots come around.

116
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,419
And if we come there,
We might have an encounter.

117
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,049
If three generations
Of this family.

118
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,619
Have been having
Ongoing activity.

119
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,289
Pretty much all that time,

120
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,189
There's something special
About this particular property.

121
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,160
That's not a coincidence.

122
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,169
This place is pretty out there.

123
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:20,399
We drove way up
Into the mountains,

124
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,639
Went to the top of this holler.

125
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,339
That's property of this family,
The bradfords.

126
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:26,670
The appalachian trail sits only
About a mile up the hill.

127
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,939
So they're right next to it.

128
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,379
And there's no buildings
Between here and there.

129
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:32,310
So, I mean,
It's prime 'squatch territory.

130
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,479
Beautiful property
You guys have back here.

131
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,849
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

132
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,119
So, we have three
Generations of the same family.

133
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,490
In front of us here?

134
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,089
And all of you have experienced
Sasquatch activity.

135
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,090
At one time or another?

136
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,329
Really?

137
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:50,529
And how long's your family been
On this piece of property?

138
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:53,769
Back to 1700s.

139
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,899
- Wow.
- Man.

140
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,100
Late 17s.

141
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,039
And how far back
Did the bigfoot activity go?

142
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,009
We'd hear tales of it
From our great-grandfather.

143
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:05,179
He would tell us to be careful
And not get too far out,

144
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,079
Or don't get in the woods
Playing.

145
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,980
We knew the rules.
We had our boundaries.

146
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:11,519
"Do not get out of sight
Or earshot."

147
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,719
how about you, lakota?
Have you ever seen one?

148
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,590
Yeah.

149
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:15,959
Where did you see one?

150
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,820
Up there.

151
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,360
What happened?

152
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,030
I was playing soccer
With my friends.

153
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,269
When the ball rolled
Down the road,

154
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,300
That's when I noticed
It was looking at us.

155
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,280
It was up on the hill.
It was standing there watching.

156
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:39,210
- Okay.
- And so it came down.

157
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:41,619
Did it sit down, or did it...
Was it standing up?

158
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,849
Standing up.

159
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,619
And what color was it?

160
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,619
Blackish brown.

161
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,889
I came outside,
And she was like,

162
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,189
"There's something up there
Watching us."

163
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,329
I saw it standing up
On the hill.

164
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:55,300
That day, I saw a bigfoot.

165
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,769
So, you and the friends.

166
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,430
Were sitting there playing
And talking about it,

167
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,599
And you all knew It was there?

168
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,339
Did you all know
It was a bigfoot?

169
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,569
No.

170
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,370
Do you think they've ever
Come around the houses?

171
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,310
Yes.

172
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:09,209
There was one That was looking.

173
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,149
In my oldest daughter's
Bedroom window.

174
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,579
After we had had
A birthday party.

175
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,349
We heard knocking...

176
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:17,119
Not really like
He was knocking...

177
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,389
Like he was kind of
Pushing his way around.

178
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,320
But my mom saw the figure
In the window.

179
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:27,199
Now, ernie, you've lived
On this property.

180
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,829
For almost six decades.

181
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,169
What's the earliest encounter
You can remember having.

182
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,230
With one Of these things?

183
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,400
40 years ago, 38 years ago?

184
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,789
There's no doubt there's
'squatches on this property.

185
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,759
They've all seen them.
They're not all lying.

186
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,829
I don't think
They're a family of liars.

187
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,029
They're just telling you
What they've seen,

188
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,199
And they have them here.

189
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,669
I have no doubt you guys
Have bigfoots on this property.

190
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,670
And you've seen them.

191
00:08:07,671 --> 00:08:09,139
Definitely.

192
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,870
Are there bigfoots
On this property?

193
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,839
I would think it would be safe
To say no.

194
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,609
Still, it's hard to argue with
Three generations of stories.

195
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,149
There's only one way
For us to find out.

196
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,819
We need to stay here
And do a night investigation.

197
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,249
If you guys would let us,

198
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:26,050
Could we do a night
Investigation around here?

199
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,790
Where would you go?

200
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,999
I think We're down for that.

201
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,999
Well, hopefully, that
Four decades of bigfoot activity.

202
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,130
Can extend at least
One more night for us.

203
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,599
- Glad to have you.
- Good luck.

204
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,500
All right.

205
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,679
We're not far from
The appalachian trail.

206
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,019
And the 'squatches up here,

207
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,849
They must have adapted
To being up in the mountains.

208
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,089
Ernie's family said.

209
00:08:58,090 --> 00:08:59,550
They've been having stuff
Happen up here.

210
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,219
For multiple generations,

211
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,759
So they're gonna be
Up around here somewhere.

212
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,459
Well, ernie seemed
To be pretty positive.

213
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,159
Even though it's wintertime,
He thinks we've got to go up.

214
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,259
To find those 'squatches.

215
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,560
Well, I like a challenge.

216
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,429
Matt, why don't we walk
Up on top of these ridges.

217
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,130
And make some calls
Back and forth?

218
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,539
And hopefully something
Is in this valley tonight.

219
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,669
All right.
We'll just go with you guys.

220
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,670
Up to the split the trail
And then fork off.

221
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,709
All right. Let's do that.

222
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,040
Yeah, Let's go fork off.

223
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:32,089
My god.
It goes straight up right here.

224
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,959
That is the trail, Isn't it?

225
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,820
I mean, This isn't even a trail.

226
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,989
I'll let you lead the way,
Bobes.

227
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,260
All right.

228
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,299
So, ernie gave us some intel.

229
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,399
That he thinks
The sasquatches go up high.

230
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,139
So that clearly means
That the teams.

231
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,369
Need to get as high
In altitude as possible.

232
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,170
So, bobo and ranae are gonna
Hit up one trail,

233
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,839
Matt and I are gonna go
To the other trail.

234
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,840
The goal here is to get
On top of the ridges.

235
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,609
And cast as wide a net
As possible,

236
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,980
And by yelling
Into adjacent valleys.

237
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,819
I thought we were gonna be
On a trail-trail.

238
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,719
Just slow and steady, man.

239
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,720
This is sucking.

240
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,269
This is the most level spot
We've found.

241
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,709
Yeah.

242
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,309
This is ridiculous.

243
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,109
Let me call The other team.

244
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:32,349
Ranae for matt.

245
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,279
What you got going on?

246
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,049
We thought we had
The easy trail.

247
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:38,349
And this basically goes.

248
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,689
Kind of straight up Back here.

249
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:42,589
It's also icy.
Any rocks are slick as snot.

250
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,790
Funny... I was just
Saying that to cliff.

251
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,159
This might be one
Of the highest points.

252
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,559
We're gonna reach.

253
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,429
He wants To do a call here.

254
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,770
All right, we'll listen.

255
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:07,519
We hear it.

256
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,180
Totally hear it.

257
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:11,689
That's good.

258
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:15,319
That means stuff's bouncing
Off the frozen walls.

259
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,589
That means We should howl back.

260
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,390
Remember, we want to attract
Attention to this area.

261
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,429
All right. You want to do it?

262
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:21,759
Yeah, sure. Sure.

263
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,129
All right, ranae, bobo,
Cliff's gonna do a howl.

264
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,299
Keep your ears on.

265
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,730
We're listening.

266
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,710
We're done.

267
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,479
Yeah, we heard it.

268
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,149
They heard it. Good.

269
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,289
That's great.

270
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:47,050
We wrapped around halfway
Around this mountain.

271
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,060
They can still hear that.

272
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,290
God, You can just slide.

273
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,129
All the way to
The frickin' creek like this.

274
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:56,829
Well, we do need To go down.

275
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,269
To get to that next section
Of trail.

276
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,569
All right, ready? Go for it.

277
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,439
I'm not tearing My rain paints.

278
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Later.

279
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:08,339
Careful with those trees.

280
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:10,010
Yeah.

281
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,819
You all right?

282
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:17,889
Yep.

283
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,890
Hope you didn't plan
On having kids.

284
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,869
It's kind of cool that
Multi-generations of that family.

285
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,839
All have had
Sasquatch encounters.

286
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,070
Yeah, that would mean
The bigfoot's been.

287
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,709
Coming back through there
Year after year.

288
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,809
For a long time, You know.

289
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:48,319
Yeah, I like that sasquatches
Are a family affair, you know?

290
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,849
I mean, because,
Like, if your family...

291
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:52,049
Your brother who you trust
With your life...

292
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,719
Says they saw
One of these things,

293
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,859
What would you do With that?

294
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,059
You would probably just
Believe them, you know?

295
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,120
Right.

296
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,930
Yeah, let's start
Doing some calls.

297
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,710
Shh!

298
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,049
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Listen, listen!

299
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,190
What?

300
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,859
Howl.

301
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,190
Where? Point.

302
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,290
That way.

303
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:41,049
Ed to north carolina.

304
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:44,019
By a family who lives
By the appalachian trail.

305
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,989
Bigfoot sightings have been
Occurring on their property.

306
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,359
For generations,

307
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,590
So we decided we're gonna stay
Right here for the night.

308
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,029
We climbed up high
Into the mountain.

309
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:53,030
To make some calls.

310
00:13:53,031 --> 00:13:56,100
And I just heard
A possible bigfoot howl.

311
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,370
Shh!

312
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:02,209
Stop, stop, stop, stop!
Listen, listen!

313
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,340
What?

314
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:09,510
Howl.

315
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:10,779
Where? Point.

316
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,080
That way.

317
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,350
How far? Far-far?

318
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,889
It's hard to tell
With the echoes,

319
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,629
But, like, half mile?

320
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,029
Ranae, bobo,
Did you guys just howl?

321
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,399
- You heard a howl?
- Yeah.

322
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,329
No, we didn't do a howl.

323
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:31,439
They're hearing a howl.
What kind of howl?

324
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,000
It was... we were walking,
Coming down off the hill,

325
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:37,470
Crunching through the leaves,
And I hear, "Waaaaah!"

326
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,409
It's in your direction,
But above you.

327
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,949
I'm gonna try To answer back.

328
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,950
Yeah, yeah.

329
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:53,860
Come on, baby, Do it again.

330
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:10,609
Come on.

331
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,239
Do us a favor.

332
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,409
Well, you know,

333
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,979
I think sasquatches
Really tune in to noises.

334
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,079
And, you know,
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

335
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,119
If something
Maybe 600 yards away.

336
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,449
Could actually hear us
Going through this forest stuff.

337
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,419
It's 6 inches deep
In spots, man.

338
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,089
They have, like,
Superhuman hearing.

339
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:29,059
Because They're superhuman-ish.

340
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,459
Okay.

341
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,560
I think we should do an inchworm
On the way back.

342
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,560
Yeah.

343
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:36,730
You walk 100 feet, Stop, listen.

344
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,739
So, one of us is standing still
While the other is walking.

345
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:42,369
If it was a 'squatch,
It could get over to us.

346
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:45,179
And what would happen is,
As we inchworm down,

347
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,379
The person who's in behind.

348
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,979
Will probably hear it
Moving through the brush.

349
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,149
If you're standing still.

350
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:51,349
All right, cool.
Well, I'll head out this way.

351
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:53,080
I'll stop
About 150 feet up there.

352
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,449
I'll wait for you. All right?

353
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:55,719
All right.

354
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,719
Flash your headlight at me
When you want to stop.

355
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,260
Okay.

356
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:04,230
Okay.

357
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,739
There's A distinct possibility.

358
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,869
That whatever made
That whoop or scream

359
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,209
<I>heard us moving
Through the leaf litter.</I>

360
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,540
Maybe it was alerting
Another sasquatch nearby.

361
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,640
We don't know.

362
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:21,779
So, to cover ourselves,

363
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,810
We're gonna use
The inchworm technique,

364
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,980
Where one person stands
Perfectly still and listens.

365
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,449
While the other person
Moves ahead.

366
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:29,919
And makes some noise.

367
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,859
Once that person gets a good
Distance ahead, we signal,

368
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,159
And then the next person
Comes up.

369
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,789
While that person stays still.

370
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:37,730
We're basically, like,
Leap-frogging each other.

371
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,939
It's slow and tedious,
And it's freezing cold.

372
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,979
But if that was a sasquatch,
Then this is the best way.

373
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:57,279
To make sure we can hear it
Following us.

374
00:16:57,280 --> 00:17:00,050
So we're gonna inchworm
All the way back to base camp.

375
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,689
Got one howl.

376
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,459
Might've been a 'squatch.

377
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,099
Nice, big howl
From up on that ridge.

378
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,399
Except for the sound of us.

379
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,499
Walking through
The forest leaf litter,

380
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,439
We heard nothing at all
Except for what matt heard.

381
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,340
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

382
00:17:19,341 --> 00:17:21,039
It was eerily quiet,
Very strange.

383
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,170
Yeah. Ernie knows this place
Like the back of his hand.

384
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,470
He's lived here His whole life.

385
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,179
But I do believe He was mistaken.

386
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,049
In thinking the 'squatches
Were up in that snow and ice.

387
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,349
I think They're down there.

388
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,219
Well, we had to check it out,
And we did.

389
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,950
So, now we'll go to town hall,
See what else we can find out.

390
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,629
Last night,
Matt might have heard something,

391
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,599
But we need a more solid lead
Than that.

392
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,599
So we need to speak
To the people in the community.

393
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:55,209
And find out where they've been
Seeing bigfoots recently.

394
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:56,939
And also where
They've seen sasquatches.

395
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,679
At this time of year.

396
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,009
Tonight's town hall is gonna be
At the young men's institute.

397
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,609
In asheville, north carolina.

398
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,350
And I cannot wait to see
How many witnesses we get.

399
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,319
Hello, asheville.

400
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,420
If you believe
That you've seen a bigfoot.

401
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,420
Or heard a bigfoot,

402
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,030
Would you raise your hand,
Please?

403
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:21,160
- Wow.
- Not bad.

404
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,570
Pretty good. Okay.

405
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,639
2:30, 3:00 in the morning,
And we're all in our tent.

406
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,169
We have a huge,
Nine-man tent out there.

407
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:31,109
And all of us are bedded down,
Buttoned down.

408
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,580
And we just start hearing
These awful, loud noises.

409
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,049
And about 20 feet
Just outside of the campsite,

410
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,680
You could see A huge figure.

411
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,689
And it was Absolutely huge.

412
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,889
It was probably
7 1/2, 8 1/2, 9 feet tall.

413
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,490
And we run, and it's about
A mile back to my house,

414
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,199
And I don't think
A single one of us stopped.

415
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,230
Until we got there.

416
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,839
And my dad was awake.

417
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,569
It was about 6:00
In the morning.

418
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,970
Comes into my room, Wakes me up.

419
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,640
And he says, "You have got
To come out here and hear this."

420
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,249
He takes me Out to the porch.

421
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:12,179
We are listening To this howling.

422
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,550
That's coming
From the mountain ridge.

423
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,599
We was traveling On the road.

424
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,960
And just entered
Into north carolina.

425
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:29,630
On the madison county side.

426
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,869
We was driving Down the road.

427
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:35,609
We was going
About 45 miles an hour.

428
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,339
A creature thing
Was running beside us.

429
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,610
It ran over
And jumped over the guardrail.

430
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,919
In over about
The last five to six years,

431
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,790
We've had A lot of encounters.

432
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:54,720
Tree knocks, whoops.

433
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,729
We sort of just tried to leave
Them alone as much as possible.

434
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,569
Because, you know,
I was one of those.

435
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,569
That if I ever seen it,
I'd kill it.

436
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,300
So everybody would know.

437
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,470
But after hearing them talking
Back and forth to each other,

438
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,309
I just leave them alone
And let them...

439
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,009
Isn't that amazing?
And that's what people think.

440
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:14,379
They say, "If I see one,
I'm gonna kill one."

441
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,279
And then, when they have
An encounter, they're like,

442
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,879
"These things
Are just way too much."

443
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,279
Like these intelligent things.

444
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,319
"It's just... it'd be
Like shooting a caveman."

445
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,919
It's just, like,
You wouldn't do it.

446
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
Yeah.

447
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,489
You guys Are not disappointing.

448
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,159
That was our best town hall
In a long time.

449
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,869
That town hall was fantastic.
We have over 40 witnesses.

450
00:20:35,870 --> 00:20:37,430
It was hairy...
Reddish-brown hair,

451
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,039
Big, glowing eyes.

452
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,309
It stood there,
And it swayed back and forth.

453
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,970
We found A partial footprint.

454
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,939
Where the creature
Stepped up on the bank.

455
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,540
By the time I got in the trailer.

456
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:48,979
And shut the door,
It hit the trailer.

457
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,719
That's only one thing
In this world it could be,

458
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,349
And that's a bigfoot.

459
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,889
That's good in one way,

460
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,519
But bad in that
That's way too many.

461
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,189
For us to even
Scratch the surface of.

462
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:01,359
Without some help.

463
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,490
So we're gonna have to call in
Some reinforcements.

464
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,200
So we can really split up
And check these out.

465
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,199
Look at all this.
It's spread all over the place.

466
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,909
And so much of this is just
Great mountain habitat.

467
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:17,809
Just, where do we start?

468
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,339
I knew asheville
Would be a good spot,

469
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,979
But it was better
Than I could have hoped for.

470
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,279
We're overloaded.

471
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,479
There's too many stories,
Too many reports.

472
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,749
And you look at the map
Where they plot it,

473
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,349
It's the whole western half
Of the state.

474
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:29,789
We're gonna need
To call in some backup.

475
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,520
I mean, we can't handle this
On our own.

476
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:35,429
Hey!

477
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:36,960
There they are.

478
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,080
Mily.

479
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:49,019
That's been experiencing
Sasquatches for centuries.

480
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,220
After being inundated
With a multitude of stories.

481
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,289
At town hall,

482
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,959
We knew
We're gonna need some help,

483
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,429
So we decided to call in
Some reinforcements.

484
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:59,030
To help us cover
All of this ground.

485
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,639
There they are.

486
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,369
We were brought out here
By ernie and his family.

487
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,570
To investigate the sasquatch
Reports they've been having,

488
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,979
So it just makes sense.

489
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:11,179
That we bring in family members
Of our own to help out.

490
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,040
- Hey!
- Hey!

491
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,179
You found us!

492
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,379
- Hey!
- Hey!

493
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,380
I know that kid.

494
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,980
I've called my brother rob.

495
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:20,289
Ranae called in laura,
Her cousin.

496
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:22,089
Glad you made it.

497
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,320
Matt's called in his son leo.

498
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:27,159
And bobo called up bud...

499
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:30,129
His bro,
His brother from another mother.

500
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,229
Good to see you.

501
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,599
Nice seeing you.

502
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,530
Of all the family and friends
That we've invited out,

503
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,000
Leo is the only one
That is confident.

504
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,769
That sasquatches
Are real animals.

505
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,009
But that's okay,
Because rob, laura, and bud...

506
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,979
Even though they're not
100% believers,

507
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,579
They're all open to the idea.

508
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,649
And they're gonna be
A great help on this expedition.

509
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,650
Good to see you, bud.

510
00:22:51,990 --> 00:22:53,989
Well, the help
Has finally arrived.

511
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,350
And, boy,
Were you all necessary,

512
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,389
Because we had
One of the biggest town halls,

513
00:22:57,390 --> 00:23:00,029
In terms of witnesses,
That we've ever had.

514
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,590
They're spread out
All over the place.

515
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,499
So we really do
Have to spread out.

516
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,629
And go in, like,
Four different directions.

517
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:08,169
And hit up multiple locations
With each team.

518
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,499
Our first witness
That we spoke to.

519
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,600
Is this guy named ernie.

520
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,639
Three generations Of his family.

521
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,270
Had seen sasquatches
On his property before.

522
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,309
So we figured,
"Well, you know what?

523
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,709
We might as well
Bring our family out."

524
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:19,309
So we're really stoked
You guys are here.

525
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,049
Yep. I brought in
My good buddy bud.

526
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,649
He's a drummer
In our bigfoot rock band,

527
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,919
The yamarone brothers.

528
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:27,089
It's the world's greatest
Bigfoot rock 'n' roll band.

529
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,589
And he used to play drums
For sublime.

530
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,520
When we went 'squatching
20 years ago,

531
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,659
Nothing happened,

532
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,129
And he's been wanting to go
Ever since.

533
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,859
So I thought this was
A perfect chance.

534
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,329
Well, you brought in
A yamarone brother.

535
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,799
I brought in
A barackman brother...

536
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,029
The real thing here, man.

537
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:41,499
This is my brother rob.

538
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,039
He's never been out
Bigfooting with me before,

539
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:45,300
But I thought this was
The perfect opportunity.

540
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,009
Well, I invited my cousin laura.

541
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:48,809
Our family reunions
Back in south dakota.

542
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,209
Behind My grandmother's house...

543
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,979
I had her believing that bigfoot
Lived on laframboise island.

544
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,249
And terrified her.

545
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,249
Sounds like you're still
Trying to terrify me.

546
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,280
Some things never change.

547
00:23:58,290 --> 00:23:59,919
And this is my son leo.

548
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,919
Cliff and bobo and ranae,
You've all met him years ago.

549
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,359
You are bigger.
He's a big boy now.

550
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,059
And he's ready
To go 'squatching with us.

551
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,559
Is this your first time
Coming out with your dad, leo?

552
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,229
No. I've been with him out
Quite a bit before,

553
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:12,399
But this Is the first time

554
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,269
I'm out investigating
Witnesses with him.

555
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,139
Well, the one I want
To check out is kendra,

556
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,009
Because her
And another witness...

557
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:22,270
And there was even a third one
That brought up spruce pine.

558
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,779
Apparently that's a place where
A lot of stuff has happened.

559
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,879
And just those bunch
Of witnesses in that one area.

560
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,279
Tend to corroborate Each other.

561
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,049
Laura, I picked david davis.

562
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:32,049
That'll be the witnesses
That we follow up with.

563
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,789
They were out at this location
With his two sons at a campfire.

564
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,289
All three of them said they
Saw it... multiple witnesses.

565
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,089
More importantly,
They were terrified.

566
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:41,090
Awesome.

567
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,099
Well, rob,
I chose these two guys.

568
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,160
Who are Bigfoot investigators...

569
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:45,399
David and rex.

570
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,729
They have a lot of stuff
Going on.

571
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,130
In this one Particular area.

572
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,699
But, most importantly,
They have evidence.

573
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:52,969
They have a cast that they claim
Is the best one ever pulled.

574
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,409
Well, I clearly want to go
Take a look at that.

575
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,509
And I'd love To show it to you.

576
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,009
Because you know Your casts.

577
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:58,579
- I'd like to think so.
- You do.

578
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,949
Okay, I'm gonna take you with me.

579
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:01,349
Down to the far
Southwest corner,

580
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:02,679
Way over there.

581
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,619
Guy named tim, a hunter.

582
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:07,250
The reason I picked him is
He had action all year long.

583
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:09,889
Aggressive 'squatches
Throwing rocks, growling.

584
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,220
Sounds like a good time.

585
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,259
Yeah, it will be.

586
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,689
Okay, We all have our partners,

587
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,059
And we all have our witnesses
That we want to go speak to.

588
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,529
Let's break apart
For a couple days.

589
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:20,169
And reconvene after that
To compare notes.

590
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,369
- Let's do it.
- Sounds good.

591
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,700
Great.

592
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:25,569
So, we've mapped out reports.

593
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:27,239
Across the entire western part
Of the state,

594
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,409
And we've developed
A plan of action.

595
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:32,879
We're gonna send out four groups
To four different areas.

596
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,249
Bobo and ranae are gonna head
To the south,

597
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:38,749
While cliff's team and my team
Are gonna go out a day later.

598
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:41,519
And hit areas closer
To asheville.

599
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,659
Doing it this way will allow us
To hit a lot more areas.

600
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,559
And hopefully find
The perfect spot.

601
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,330
Or our final
Night investigation.

602
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:09,379
So, I invited bud,

603
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,019
A buddy of mine
From the old punk-rock days.

604
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,549
Down in southern california.

605
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,989
Bud's always been a drummer.

606
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,989
He's drummed in tons of bands,
Most notably sublime.

607
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:18,689
We used to hang out
A lot together on the road,

608
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,159
Spent a lot of time with bud.

609
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,190
I took bud 'squatching
About 20 years ago,

610
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,259
Nothing happened.

611
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,529
We've been trying to get out,

612
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:27,169
But never been able
To coordinate it until now.

613
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,239
Bud, I wish you were There at
the town hall The other night.

614
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,539
It was incredible.

615
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,469
One guy I wanted you
To check out with me.

616
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,769
Was tim.

617
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,739
He's had ongoing activity
On his hunting property.

618
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,979
For five to six years Straight.

619
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,679
And what's most important
For us is year-round.

620
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,779
Really? Yeah.

621
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,319
No matter what season.

622
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,049
I've gone out
'squatching before.

623
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,819
But it was,
Like, all fun and games.

624
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,059
This is more of, like,
Almost "Csi" kind of stuff,

625
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,959
Where we're looking
Into specific evidence.

626
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,699
Luckily, I've watched a lot
Of crime-investigation stories.

627
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,069
So I think I got
My inspector clouseau on.

628
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,469
- Hey, tim.
- Hey, guys.

629
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,469
Beautiful spot, man. Thank you.

630
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,009
This is my friend... bud.

631
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:09,309
Hey, nice to meet you.

632
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:10,409
Yeah, thanks
For bringing us out here.

633
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:11,909
This place is killer.

634
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:13,479
Yeah, it ain't bad.

635
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,979
This is a real pretty part
Of the country.

636
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,419
You've got real mountains,
Steep terrain.

637
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,719
You pull up that little holler,

638
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,449
It's got rhododendrons
Over the whole flank.

639
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,450
I mean, it's just
This beautiful little spot.

640
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,420
There's little
Grass meadow areas.

641
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:27,629
It's the perfect spot
For deer and bigfoot.

642
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:30,829
Like, geographically speaking,
Like, where are we right now,

643
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,899
And how remote?

644
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,999
Are there homes In the area?

645
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,299
No. It's all national forest.

646
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,540
For hundreds of thousands
Of acres.

647
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,479
So, how far are we
From the appalachian trail?

648
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,979
Through the wood, 8 or 10 miles.

649
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,649
And if you know
The right ridges,

650
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,119
You can be there
A lot quicker than that.

651
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,519
And 'squatches know that.

652
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,119
Yeah, that's for sure.

653
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,589
Yeah, the reason
I brought bud up here with me.

654
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,519
Is because you guys have
Year-round action.

655
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,289
And most people
We heard at town hall.

656
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:01,029
Were mostly summertime
Or warm-weather months.

657
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,429
Just when we think
It's gonna quit,

658
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,829
It starts up again.

659
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,199
What would keep the 'squatches
Here year-round?

660
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,299
Is there something unique
About this area?

661
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,299
Is there a lot or animals,
Or is it warmer?

662
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,800
The weather ain't quite as bad
'cause it's shielded.

663
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:14,009
And also, We have feeders out.

664
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,979
That keep the deer And 'coons.

665
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,080
And that kind of stuff
Here year-round.

666
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,449
Tim is a hard-core
Year-round hunter.

667
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:23,679
He puts up game cameras.

668
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,649
With salt licks and deer feeders
In front of them.

669
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,749
That brings in the deer.

670
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:28,689
And the deer bring in
The 'squatches.

671
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,519
While it's never been caught
On a game camera,

672
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,789
Theres lots of stories
From hunters.

673
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:34,159
Of salt licks
Being carried off by bigfoots.

674
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,899
So, what was the first thing
You noticed here.

675
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,740
That made you think,
"This could be a bigfoot"?

676
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,799
I was setting up In this loft,

677
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,570
Waiting on a wild hog to come in
To a feeder in the yard.

678
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,479
And three 'coons come out
To feed at the feeder.

679
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,479
And all of a sudden,
They run back.

680
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,880
And something caught
One of them.

681
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:01,190
And whatever caught it
Started whistling.

682
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,359
And it would do that
And wait about 5 or 10 seconds,

683
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:08,090
And then It would do it again.

684
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,559
Did something answer it
When it whistled?

685
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,099
Not that we heard.

686
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,830
Then I tried to think
Of what could be whistling.

687
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:17,539
When you've been in the woods
As long as I have,

688
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:21,870
You pretty much figure out
What sounds the animals make.

689
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,509
And it was nothing
That I'd ever heard before.

690
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,210
We're you open to the idea
Of bigfoot prior to that?

691
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:31,049
Well, I'm one of them,
"Yeah, maybe" S.

692
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,850
But after that, we've sort of
Come to accept it, you know?

693
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,620
You just come in,
Don't bother them,

694
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,059
And hope They don't bother you.

695
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,959
On the way here, bud asked me
If you had any evidence.

696
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,899
And I said,
"Well, he's got photos."

697
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:45,429
Yeah. I've got some here
On my tablet.

698
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:49,739
One is where you can see it
Looking around a tree.

699
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,839
Is that a shoulder and a head,
You think?

700
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,370
Yeah. It's just about got to be,
Because the way that...

701
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,479
As big as it is
And the way that it slope,

702
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,079
It ain't a bear's head
Because a bear's ears...

703
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,210
Yeah... Are up on top.

704
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:04,419
They're not Over to the side.

705
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,849
And I don't think It's anybody,

706
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:08,589
Because I ain't seen
Nobody that big.

707
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,389
How big do you think
It is, about?

708
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:11,720
I would say...

709
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,589
Just guessing from the size
Of the tree and stuff...

710
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:16,100
Its shoulders would probably be
At least that wide.

711
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:20,169
You said that you had
A picture of a footprint.

712
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,070
Can I see that one?

713
00:30:21,071 --> 00:30:23,099
Yeah. It's right here.

714
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,669
And we compared it
To my buddy's foot.

715
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:27,239
What size shoe does he wear?

716
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,170
He wears a size 10 1/2.

717
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,309
10 1/2?

718
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,340
And it's a lot bigger
Than he is.

719
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,409
That's pretty long.

720
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,849
I'd say about
Another 6 or 7 inches.

721
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,010
Longer than...

722
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,919
That's not a human barefoot
Running around.

723
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,749
If he is,

724
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,389
I don't want
To meet him, either.

725
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:43,459
This place Just reeks 'squatch.

726
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,089
I mean, this place,
You look around,

727
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,759
No one would doubt that
You had these experiences.

728
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,359
In this beautiful,
Little valley.

729
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,159
Yeah.
There's something going on.

730
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,499
And we can't explain it.

731
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,299
That's the reason I wanted
To get ahold of you guys.

732
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,639
Well, I like this spot a lot.

733
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,369
Bud and I have been buddies
For over 20 years.

734
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,339
And he's been wanting
To get out with me.

735
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,039
You mind Taking us out tonight?

736
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:05,009
<I>Well, I'll let you go.
I don't have my gun.</I>

737
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:07,979
And I don't go through here
Without some kind of gun.

738
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,019
At nighttime?

739
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:13,389
Nighttime, daytime,
Morning time, any time.

740
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:14,719
Wow.

741
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,959
If I hear someone's
Running from a 'squatch spot

742
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:20,890
<I>'cause it's too scary,
I'm running to that spot.</I>

743
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,559
We're gonna save some money
On gas tonight,

744
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,799
Because we don't got to drive
Anywhere to go 'squatching.

745
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,129
We going right here.

746
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:28,770
So, this is where we're gonna do
Our night investigation.

747
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,279
I reached out To my cousin laura.

748
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,819
To come help us investigate
These bigfoot reports.

749
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,449
We've always been close
Over the years.

750
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:48,650
But I've never gone bigfooting
With any of my relatives,

751
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:51,989
And I think laura would be
The perfect one for the job.

752
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:54,890
Laura and I are on our way
To meet with david davis.

753
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,029
And his two sons.

754
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,329
While they were out camping,

755
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:59,569
They believe a bigfoot
Was stalking them.

756
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,499
In the middle of the night.

757
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,139
Well, I'm really glad
That you're coming along.

758
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,100
Not just 'cause you're a cousin.
This is gonna be fun.

759
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,170
But additionally, laura,
You're a parent.

760
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,679
Who has two sons,
You know, about that age.

761
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,009
Right.

762
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:14,379
You have that insight
Of where kids have a tendency.

763
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,479
To maybe overreact
And exaggerate.

764
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,049
I may not be a bigfoot expert,
Obviously.

765
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,419
But what I can bring
To this investigation.

766
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,889
Is my experience as a parent
And a teacher.

767
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:24,920
Yeah.

768
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,729
You're working with kids
All day long.

769
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,290
You know How they tell tales,

770
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,029
Or you know how
They get excited in the moment.

771
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:33,229
And build something up
From here to there.

772
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,230
Right.

773
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,169
There they are. Hey, guys!

774
00:32:38,170 --> 00:32:39,339
Hey. How are you?

775
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,609
Sweet, little spot Back here.

776
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:41,970
I understand why
You'd want to go camping.

777
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:43,239
It's absolutely gorgeous.

778
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,409
This is my cousin, Laura.

779
00:32:44,410 --> 00:32:45,440
Hey, laura.
Pleasure to meet you.

780
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,479
Good to see you guys.

781
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,579
So, now that we are
At this location,

782
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,319
Can you share with us
What happened to you guys.

783
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,680
That day and evening?

784
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:52,650
Absolutely.

785
00:32:52,651 --> 00:32:54,219
They were having A campout.

786
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,920
And having a little
Airsoft war party.

787
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,360
Somewhere during the middle
Of the matches we were playing,

788
00:33:05,370 --> 00:33:06,899
The campsite
Just starts getting, like,

789
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,530
Pelted sporadically
Here and there.

790
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:09,940
With, Like, little pebbles.

791
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,479
It gets to be about, you know,
Late in the evening.

792
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,049
And so we decide To bed down.

793
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:23,450
It's about 2:30, 3:00.

794
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,419
We start hearing A lot of ruckus.

795
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:30,389
And a lot of noises
Like branches breaking.

796
00:33:30,390 --> 00:33:32,929
And just around the perimeter
Of the camp out here,

797
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:35,859
Something huge
Just starts coming out.

798
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,159
And all of a sudden, Just, like,

799
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,129
The largest barrel-chested,
Deep-throated, guttural noise.

800
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:41,830
Just issues from it.

801
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,159
Where we've come to investigate
All the sightings.

802
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,260
Along the appalachian trail.

803
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:58,069
After an overwhelming number
Of reports at the town hall,

804
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:59,499
We called in our friends
And family.

805
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,269
To help us investigate.

806
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,939
Right now,
Ranae and her cousin laura.

807
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,139
Are meeting with witnesses.

808
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,910
Who had
A very strange encounter.

809
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,379
And all of a sudden, Just, like,

810
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,310
The largest, barrel-chested,
Deep-throated, guttural noise.

811
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,980
Just issues from it.

812
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:19,489
You could feel, like,
The tremors through the tent.

813
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:21,889
Every one of us
Were scared to death.

814
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:25,429
But then, it just meandered on
Out of the campsite.

815
00:34:25,430 --> 00:34:26,859
Well, what was it doing
Out there?

816
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,129
Was it, you know,
Upright the whole time,

817
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:30,399
Or was it bending over?

818
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,499
Looked like it was just
Scouting out the place,

819
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,699
Seeing What was going on.

820
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,939
It just turned to us
Immediately,

821
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:37,209
And it was just like.

822
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,670
Something deep
And throaty like that.

823
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,809
And you could just tell
It was, like, barrel-chested.

824
00:34:40,810 --> 00:34:42,040
And had come From deep within.

825
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:45,179
And you did feel like it was
Directed at the tent?

826
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,949
Yeah. It felt like
It was trying to intimidate us,

827
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,949
Like,
So we wouldn't do anything.

828
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:51,219
Did it work?

829
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,719
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.

830
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:54,489
So, you're positive,
All three of you,

831
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,659
It could not be a bear?

832
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,229
- No.
- I don't think it was a bear.

833
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:59,529
I mean, this thing
Stood upright and walked.

834
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:01,129
From as far as we had
A visual on it from there.

835
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,829
All the way Till it was gone.

836
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:05,469
So, I don't know
Of any bears that can do that.

837
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:06,799
This is exactly
Where the tent was?

838
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,000
Absolutely, yup.

839
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,669
And you had a campfire,
Which was located where?

840
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,809
It's just over there,
About 15, 20 feet away.

841
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,809
Probably right there.

842
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:17,349
And where was
The figure standing.

843
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,219
When you all saw it
Through this window?

844
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,880
Just right over here.

845
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,889
That's close.

846
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:28,059
Yeah. It was a little
Too close for comfort.

847
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,889
I'm definitely not saying
Nothing happened.

848
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,959
Those kids and that dad,
They were scared,

849
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,199
And they definitely
Saw something really big.

850
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,099
What they saw, I don't know.

851
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,099
So, now that
We are at this location,

852
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,639
We can try to get an idea
Of how big it is.

853
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,139
'Cause the whole point
Of being here.

854
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,869
Is we want to rule out
All other possibilities.

855
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,939
All right. Sounds good.

856
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,270
All right,
I'm gonna head over there.

857
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,200
And you guys tell me
Where I'm in the right spot.

858
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,410
Let's hop on in.
You can look through the window.

859
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,249
And we can get ranae
In the correct position.

860
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,350
Okay. Love to.

861
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,529
Okay, so it's this tree
Right here, david?

862
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:06,999
Yes, ma'am.

863
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,629
This one? That one right there.

864
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,529
Okay.

865
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:12,269
David, you mentioned
A particular branch.

866
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,700
Is that it right there,
Next to ranae there?

867
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,239
Yup. The branch right there
Above her head,

868
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:17,569
Where she's got
Her hand right now.

869
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,839
Okay, so the figure's head
Went by this branch?

870
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,740
I'd say the shoulders
Were probably square.

871
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,949
With that branch Right there.

872
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,779
Saying... Here?

873
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:27,349
Yeah. That's exactly it.

874
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:29,549
That's about 10 inches
Above my shoulder.

875
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:32,119
So, boys,
You saw it walking, right?

876
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,060
Yeah. And it didn't seem.

877
00:36:33,061 --> 00:36:35,020
To be paying
Much attention to you.

878
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:38,229
Can you describe to ranae
How it was moving along?

879
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:41,199
Yeah. Just a slow, casual walk,

880
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,829
Just like The patterson film.

881
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:45,399
You saw its profile as it walked
Right here to pass these trees?

882
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,539
Yes, ma'am.

883
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:48,569
Kind of, like,
Maybe something like this.

884
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:50,969
Yes, ma'am.

885
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:53,479
A little slower.
A little more deliberate.

886
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,309
And then where did it stop?

887
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,749
It stopped right about In that
exact spot That you're at now.

888
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:59,010
Right here, okay.

889
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,449
So, you guys are opening
That zipper at that window,

890
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,189
And it turns
And looks at you face on?

891
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:06,559
Squared up with us, yup.

892
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,790
And then it growled.

893
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,929
Exactly.

894
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,990
Maybe not that vicious,
But something like that.

895
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,499
Rah!

896
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,569
You've heard bears growl
And grunt out here,

897
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,500
Or have you not?

898
00:37:18,501 --> 00:37:19,839
- I have, absolutely have.
- Okay.

899
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,639
And it was not a bear?
It was not.

900
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,509
It lasted a lot longer
Than a bear's growl,

901
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,139
And was very much deeper.

902
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,539
And it could've just
Been the moment,

903
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,840
But it seemed Like it was deeper.

904
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,749
Than anything I've ever heard
In these woods before.

905
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,010
All right, well,
We've got the measurements.

906
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,679
I'm heading back over, Guys.

907
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,619
They're positive
That they saw a bigfoot.

908
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,989
But I cannot rule out
The possibilities.

909
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,289
That that wasn't a person.

910
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:42,589
They saw a figure briefly,
A few seconds at a time.

911
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:45,990
By a dimly lit,
Coal-based campfire.

912
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,429
Walking About 50, 60 yards away.

913
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:51,330
Still, laura and I, we're gonna
Hang out here tonight.

914
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,269
And do some investigating
Of our own.

915
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:54,739
We'll see if we can uncover.

916
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,709
What was really
Scaring that family.

917
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,509
While they were out camping.

918
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,439
Meanwhile, bobo and bud
Are gonna conduct.

919
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,179
A night investigation
Of their own.

920
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,449
Near a cavernous area.

921
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,410
At the foot
Of the appalachian trail.

922
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,290
Look at this.

923
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,229
Wow.

924
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:23,100
There's a nice rock overhang
Right there.

925
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:31,709
Might be a cave.

926
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:34,579
Yeah, it is.

927
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,509
This is pretty cool.

928
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,979
Mountain lion, bear,
'squatches... anything.

929
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,149
Why wouldn't a 'squatch
Chill up here?

930
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:46,350
I'm gonna try a whoop.

931
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,459
I'll bounce it Off the rock.

932
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,659
Yeah. Here you go.

933
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,429
Whoop!

934
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:52,629
Whoop!

935
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,699
Want to try to whoop?

936
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,400
Yeah.

937
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,969
Whoop!

938
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:03,839
Yeah. Whoop!

939
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,370
Dude, that's it.

940
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:09,309
Eat your heart out, Cliff.

941
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:11,149
Hey, laura.

942
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:13,550
This is a good tree
For a wood-knock right here.

943
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,420
Now we just want to listen.

944
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,820
And hopefully we hear
A response,

945
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,460
Hear a wood-knock back.

946
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:31,399
Actually, you want to do
A swing at it?

947
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,130
Yeah.

948
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:36,139
All right.

949
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,340
Batter up.

950
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,349
Nicely done, cousin.
Way to do grandma proud.

951
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,810
I have to admit, I'm hoping
For an uneventful night.

952
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,019
<I>I'm hoping for
An eventful night, laura.</I>

953
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,119
Yeah, I know you are.

954
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,889
What do you think?
What do you believe?

955
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:56,420
Do you think there's
An undiscovered bipedal ape.

956
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:58,259
Running around north america
Undetected?

957
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,999
A flesh-and-blood animal?

958
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,129
I don't think so.

959
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:03,699
It doesn't seem likely that,
You know,

960
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:08,339
Something would be so elusive,
Yet there's so many sightings.

961
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:11,069
It just... it doesn't seem
To make sense.

962
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,909
As a scientist,
As a field biologist,

963
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:15,579
I just don't see any evidence
That supports it.

964
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:18,049
However, I'm fascinated
By the phenomena,

965
00:40:18,050 --> 00:40:20,619
And I would gladly
Be proven wrong.

966
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,549
We should move up this trail,
Hit another spot.

967
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,250
All right.

968
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,789
Hey, bud. Yeah?

969
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,690
I want to do A couple knocks.

970
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,229
Ooh!

971
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,900
That hurt.

972
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:45,070
Yes.

973
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:47,279
Damn.

974
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,510
That was bad.

975
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,689
Pshew, pshew!

976
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:00,420
That's what drums are,
Is hollowed-out trees.

977
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:05,960
You're a natural, bud.

978
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,569
- Dude, you hear that?!
- I did.

979
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:17,639
Bud, that sounded like
Wood on wood to me.

980
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,979
It was like
Knock, knock, knock, knock.

981
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,479
I think there was four.

982
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,180
I heard four.

983
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,760
Dude, I think I have something.

984
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:50,519
Carolina,

985
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,329
Where reports of bigfoots
Run rampant.

986
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:54,790
While ranae And her cousin laura.

987
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,459
Are in the midst
Of a rainy investigation.

988
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,029
On one part
Of the appalachian trail,

989
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:01,169
Bobo and bud are exploring
A portion of the trail.

990
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:03,069
That's riddled with caves.

991
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:08,610
And bobo and his friend bud
Just got something on therm.

992
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:14,110
Dude, I think I have something.

993
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,080
Right up there,
There's something glowing hot.

994
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,659
I don't think That's an animal.

995
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,129
Unless it's something
Laying down.

996
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:29,359
I think it's a rock.

997
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,300
But still, A rock doesn't knock.

998
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,069
So hopefully, if that was
Something knocking,

999
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:36,699
It knocks again
Or throws a rock or something.

1000
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,869
Yeah.

1001
00:42:37,870 --> 00:42:40,439
It turns out
What we were looking at.

1002
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,509
Glowing hot on the therm
Was just a rock.

1003
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,279
But we definitely heard
Knocking sounds coming.

1004
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,479
From that general direction.

1005
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,779
So bud and I will go up there.

1006
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,910
And see if we can figure out
What made that noise.

1007
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,749
All right.
This is a good sign, bud.

1008
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,820
Yeah, it is. Let's go find him.

1009
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,889
Okay, laura, right here.

1010
00:42:58,890 --> 00:43:00,359
It's time To do a vocalization.

1011
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,390
All right.

1012
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,400
Let's go, cuz.

1013
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:12,239
That was good. That was good.

1014
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,910
Let's give it a listen.

1015
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:21,850
Okay, I'm gonna try one here.

1016
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:32,320
You got some lungs.

1017
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:35,030
It's a family thing, you know.
Got good genes.

1018
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,169
I can't help but wonder...

1019
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:47,069
The knocks and the howls,
I would think...

1020
00:43:47,070 --> 00:43:48,539
You know, this creature,
I guess,

1021
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,579
Has a reputation
Of being elusive.

1022
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,409
I would think
That would make him run away.

1023
00:43:53,410 --> 00:43:56,219
Instead of respond.

1024
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,819
I agree. You know,
Wouldn't you want.

1025
00:43:57,820 --> 00:43:59,619
To just be Stealth and quiet.

1026
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:04,259
And hope you hear something,
And then just observe?

1027
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,359
But the guys believe that
It's a technique.

1028
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,529
That they can use
To draw them in closer,

1029
00:44:09,530 --> 00:44:12,030
And then they want
To videotape it.

1030
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:16,899
Wow. It wraps around up here.

1031
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,840
This is pretty epic.

1032
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,510
You can just feel it.
Like, this is the spot.

1033
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,919
I think we should do
Some calls from here.

1034
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,719
You're right.

1035
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:35,690
He would hear it
Through the whole canyon.

1036
00:44:37,930 --> 00:44:39,489
Should I do The angry growl?

1037
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:40,559
Do what ever you feel.

1038
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,390
You just got to channel
Enough force.

1039
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,870
That was rad.

1040
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:23,199
Bud and I definitely heard
Something out here tonight.

1041
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,539
Something made those knocks.

1042
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,470
We tried to get more responses.
Nothing worked.

1043
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,609
We never figured out
What it was.

1044
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:30,739
Think we need to find
Another spot.

1045
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:32,110
For our final overnight.

1046
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:43,359
With an opportunity
To bring in an extra hand,

1047
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,920
I can't think of anybody else

1048
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:47,829
I'd rather bring out
Than my older brother rob.

1049
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:49,190
I really looked up to him.

1050
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,499
And took after him
In so many ways.

1051
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,199
Everything
From my quirky mannerisms,

1052
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,330
Shockingly good looks,

1053
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,939
And sense of humor
Can be blamed on rob.

1054
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,569
And finally, rob's gonna
Come out with me.

1055
00:45:58,570 --> 00:45:59,609
On an investigation.

1056
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,570
And hear firsthand
From witnesses.

1057
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,409
What they've been finding.

1058
00:46:03,410 --> 00:46:05,779
I guess it's kind of like
"Take your kid to work" day,

1059
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:08,750
Except that my kid is 5 years
Older and 4 inches taller.

1060
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:13,019
We're gonna go visit
David and rex,

1061
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,519
Two bigfoot researchers.

1062
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:18,089
That have been working one
Relatively small area for years,

1063
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:20,089
And claim to have
Ongoing activity.

1064
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:21,459
And really important
Things, too...

1065
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,429
They saw one
This time last year.

1066
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,029
And, probably
Most important of all,

1067
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:26,099
They have Some hard evidence.

1068
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,569
They have A footprint in cast.

1069
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:29,330
That they claim
Is one of the best,

1070
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,269
<I>if not the best, Ever collected.</I>

1071
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,309
Now, obviously, that kind of
Pricked my ears up,

1072
00:46:33,310 --> 00:46:34,770
And that's why I wanted to go.

1073
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:37,640
Yeah, 'cause you have Your own
collection Of over 200 casts.

1074
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:39,949
Exactly. I've got quite a few
Of these things.

1075
00:46:39,950 --> 00:46:42,279
But I think if you get
A good look at that cast.

1076
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,319
And compare it To what you know.

1077
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,019
From all the ones That you have,

1078
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,900
You'll be able to tell
Whether it's real or not.

1079
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:51,059
Hey, guys. Hey, guys. Hi.

1080
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:54,390
- Little chilly.
- Yes, it is.

1081
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,499
Now, you guys have been having
A lot of activity.

1082
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,899
On this property and nearby
For quite a while, right?

1083
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,329
- Yes.
- Yes.

1084
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:04,199
We actually operate a bigfoot
Research group out of this.

1085
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,700
I have a dedicated team.

1086
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:09,509
We've been on property
Now since 2013.

1087
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,480
Well, back me up.

1088
00:47:10,481 --> 00:47:11,740
What's some
Of the earliest stuff.

1089
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:13,009
That kind of started
Clueing you in.

1090
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:15,510
That sasquatches
Might be in the area?

1091
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,349
Well, the main thing
That we found, 2010,

1092
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,749
Was a footprint.

1093
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,189
My neighbor gave us a call.

1094
00:47:21,190 --> 00:47:22,589
And told us
To check something out.

1095
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,420
So I got my camera, and me
And my brother went up there.

1096
00:47:25,430 --> 00:47:29,159
And when I saw it,
I was blowed away.

1097
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:31,429
It made one footprint
Across this road.

1098
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,669
It had to have a stride
Of over 6 foot.

1099
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:36,699
And we decided
To take a cast of it.

1100
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,069
Now, is that the cast
That you guys told me about...

1101
00:47:39,070 --> 00:47:40,839
Is the best one ever made?

1102
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:42,870
The best one I have ever seen.

1103
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,579
Okay. I think it's time.

1104
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,040
I'd like to see the cast,
Please.

1105
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,780
- Okay.
- Absolutely.

1106
00:47:51,620 --> 00:47:53,519
At cliff's house,
He has a shed in the back.

1107
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,919
And there are shelves in there,

1108
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:58,589
And it's lined with literally
Hundreds of bigfoot casts.

1109
00:47:58,590 --> 00:48:00,859
It seems to me
The casting of bigfoot prints.

1110
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:02,890
Is cliff's life.

1111
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:04,199
He can look at a cast
And tell you.

1112
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:06,699
Whether it's legit or not
In just seconds.

1113
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,330
It's interesting.
It's not super deep.

1114
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,469
I do like The shape of the toes.

1115
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:11,739
Now, cliff,
Would you expect the toes.

1116
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,769
To be looking this rounded
Along like that?

1117
00:48:13,770 --> 00:48:15,639
In some cases, yes.

1118
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,809
And, initially,
I had a brief concern because...

1119
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:20,849
You see the steep ledge.

1120
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:23,649
To the inside of the toe pads
Right there?

1121
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,149
That can sometimes
Be indicative of a hoax.

1122
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:29,219
Because the way, like, a plank
Would go out of the ground...

1123
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:30,489
As someone walks across.

1124
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:33,259
There are some things
About this cast.

1125
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,359
That kind of worry me.

1126
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,459
The heel impression
Is very distinct.

1127
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,960
The toes are
Kind of squarish in a way.

1128
00:48:38,970 --> 00:48:40,369
And I've seen that before.

1129
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:42,730
In cookie-cutter-style stompers,
You know?

1130
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,339
Like fake feet, basically.

1131
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,939
Now, I don't know
That's what made this,

1132
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,739
Because we only have One cast.

1133
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:50,379
No other casts To compare it to.

1134
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:52,040
We almost have No information.

1135
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,649
Okay, I understand
One of you gentlemen.

1136
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:57,019
Has had an eye-witness account
Here at the property.

1137
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,549
Who was that? What happened?

1138
00:48:58,550 --> 00:48:59,619
That would be me. Okay.

1139
00:48:59,620 --> 00:49:02,150
So, about this time Last year,

1140
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:04,859
Myself and two other researchers
Were on property.

1141
00:49:04,860 --> 00:49:07,690
We were about 100 yards away
From where we're standing now.

1142
00:49:07,700 --> 00:49:10,699
When they thought
Maybe they saw some eye shine.

1143
00:49:10,700 --> 00:49:12,429
And something run
Across the property.

1144
00:49:12,430 --> 00:49:13,799
Right behind you guys.

1145
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,840
So I walked off by myself
To try to find the creature.

1146
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:21,609
Maybe less than 100 yards
Behind you guys,

1147
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,940
I saw it step out,
Look from behind the tree.

1148
00:49:29,730 --> 00:49:32,069
Mber.

1149
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:34,099
Of sasquatch sightings
Coming out of an area.

1150
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:37,339
Near north carolina's
Appalachian trail.

1151
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:38,609
We've called our families
And friends.

1152
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,639
To help us investigate
All these reports.

1153
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,909
And right now,
Cliff and his brother rob.

1154
00:49:42,910 --> 00:49:44,279
Are meeting with two witnesses.

1155
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,880
Who've had multiple experiences
On the same property.

1156
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:52,550
I saw it step out,
Look from behind the tree.

1157
00:49:55,430 --> 00:50:00,259
And this thing just gave me
A quick glance, stepped back in,

1158
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,729
And it was over with That quick.

1159
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:03,429
About how far away were you
At that point?

1160
00:50:03,430 --> 00:50:06,099
Maybe 30, 40 feet
From the creature.

1161
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,299
- That's pretty close.
- Yeah.

1162
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,300
So, how big was this thing
That you were looking at?

1163
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,170
I believe it to be
Around 7 1/2 to 8 feet tall.

1164
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,039
Okay. And that's based on
What it was standing next to?

1165
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,749
Yes. So, I could clearly see
The full shoulder,

1166
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:20,110
The arm,
And half of the head area.

1167
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:22,549
Wasn't really a neck
That I can make out,

1168
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:26,419
'cause, I mean, it was just a
Really thick, massive creature.

1169
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,859
When you were at 30 feet away
From the creature or so,

1170
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,159
And you were staring at him,
Were you just having,

1171
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,329
Like, a stare fight
Looking back at each other?

1172
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,699
No. I couldn't tell you
What it was doing.

1173
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,129
When it looked at me.

1174
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,099
But I had no fear
That it was gonna hurt me.

1175
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,769
What else has been
Going on nearby?

1176
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:47,139
Tree knocks,
Whoops, yells, grunts.

1177
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:49,340
And we actually have gifts
That have been for us.

1178
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,509
On the property...

1179
00:50:50,510 --> 00:50:53,149
Rocks that they have left us
On our trailhead.

1180
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:56,219
There's clearly
Something going on.

1181
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,019
On this property And around it.

1182
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,889
This property looks perfect
For this kind of action.

1183
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,319
And there's just
Too many little things.

1184
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:02,659
That all kind of add up.

1185
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,229
A lot of "Maybes" equal
A "Probably" at this point,

1186
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,290
You know?

1187
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,429
I cannot say for sure.

1188
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:08,999
Whether that cast
Or any of the activity.

1189
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,369
That's been going on
On this property is real.

1190
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,599
<I>However, I do know.</I>

1191
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,199
That there's a lot
Of bigfoot activity.

1192
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,639
All along The appalachian trail,

1193
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:17,339
So maybe they're here.

1194
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,070
So, rob and I are gonna
Hang out for a while,

1195
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,309
Wait for the sun to go down,

1196
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:22,240
And then do our own
Night investigation.

1197
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:23,579
Right where rex and dave said.

1198
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,310
They've been getting
So much activity.

1199
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:36,120
Here in asheville,
They really like their beer.

1200
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,259
I think they like their beer.

1201
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:38,529
More than they like
Their bibles.

1202
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,659
There's more breweries.

1203
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,660
Than there are churches
In this town.

1204
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:46,269
Bobo found this one brewery
That has a sasquatch beer,

1205
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:47,639
So we're gonna go
Check that out.

1206
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:49,670
I mean, it's a given, right?

1207
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:52,840
Cheers.

1208
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:57,749
Got a good flavor.

1209
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,149
- That's pretty unique.
- Yeah.

1210
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:02,019
That'd be perfect... 'squatch
hunting With a sasquash.

1211
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,419
<I>It's called sasquash?</I>

1212
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:04,789
That is the sasquash.

1213
00:52:04,790 --> 00:52:07,889
Did a little spin on The butternut
squash That's in there.

1214
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:09,420
Got it. Yeah.

1215
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:11,089
'Squatching is thirsty business.

1216
00:52:11,090 --> 00:52:13,559
Beer is great and all, but
I'm here for what's left over.

1217
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:17,929
After they make the beer...
The spent grains.

1218
00:52:17,930 --> 00:52:19,030
When you brew beer,
You're left over.

1219
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:20,399
With all these spent grains.

1220
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,799
And farmers'll come haul it off.

1221
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:23,669
And slop it to their hogs
And chickens.

1222
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:24,909
They report
When they put it out,

1223
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:26,070
The bigfoots will come right in,

1224
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:27,270
Not even look
At the chickens and pigs,

1225
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,209
And just grab that slop
And just eat it.

1226
00:52:30,210 --> 00:52:31,879
It's like the breakfast
Of champions here.

1227
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,810
It is.

1228
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:34,949
I always thought
It would be a good idea.

1229
00:52:34,950 --> 00:52:36,619
To go to 'squatch
A little drunk, you know?

1230
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,050
'Cause then they'd start, like,
Getting loud and loose.

1231
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:40,719
And show themselves.

1232
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:41,720
Kind of like me.

1233
00:52:43,190 --> 00:52:45,359
So, bud and I are gonna
Take some of that spent grain.

1234
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:48,229
Out with us, spread it around,
Put some trail cams up,

1235
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:49,929
And hopefully we bring in
A bigfoot.

1236
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:51,499
If it doesn't bring in
A bigfoot right away,

1237
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,930
It can still
Attract deer and pig.

1238
00:52:53,940 --> 00:52:55,700
And that can attract A 'squatch.

1239
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,139
So, when bud and I meet up
With the rest of the team.

1240
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,809
For the final
Night investigation,

1241
00:52:58,810 --> 00:52:59,890
We'll have a secret weapon.

1242
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:11,949
Leo has been with me a few times
Before on expeditions,

1243
00:53:11,950 --> 00:53:13,289
But this is the first time.

1244
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,820
He's come with me
To a witness investigation,

1245
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:18,159
So it's pretty special
For him and for me.

1246
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,290
Leo has heard me.

1247
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,629
Talking to witnesses
On the phone many times,

1248
00:53:21,630 --> 00:53:24,699
So he knows the interview
Process that I go through.

1249
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:27,030
I'm interested to see
What questions he'll have.

1250
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:30,269
And if he's got
That investigation talent, too.

1251
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:33,370
This is so great
That you came to help me out.

1252
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,640
I know you've never been
To this part of the country.

1253
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,040
Yeah, I'm stoked.
This is awesome.

1254
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:38,449
So, who are we going
To meet right now?

1255
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:39,749
Her name is kendra.

1256
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:41,449
She was at
The town hall meeting.

1257
00:53:41,450 --> 00:53:44,219
Something wakes her up,
She looks out her window,

1258
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,889
And she's saying
15 feet outside the window.

1259
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:49,220
Is this big,
Reddish-haired thing,

1260
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:50,559
And then it just turns
And walks away.

1261
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:51,560
Wow.

1262
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:54,359
So, when I'm out there With you,

1263
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,699
What should I be
Paying attention to?

1264
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:57,129
Is there Any telltale signs.

1265
00:53:57,130 --> 00:53:58,999
That I should kind of
Be looking for?

1266
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,299
You know, that's just something
That comes from experience,

1267
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,600
Because you get a feeling.

1268
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,839
From somebody
Who's making up a story.

1269
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:06,539
And you don't get That feeling.

1270
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,639
From somebody Who's telling you.

1271
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,009
Just something
That happened to them.

1272
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:11,049
I'll be paying attention To her.

1273
00:54:11,050 --> 00:54:12,849
<I>The thing you should be
Paying attention to.</I>

1274
00:54:12,850 --> 00:54:13,949
Is the environment.

1275
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,719
Think, is this
The sort of place that,

1276
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,980
If you were a bigfoot,

1277
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,650
You could skulk around
And feel safe and at home,

1278
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:21,589
Knowing that nobody
Can easily shoot you,

1279
00:54:21,590 --> 00:54:23,620
Or even see you?

1280
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:28,730
How you doing?

1281
00:54:28,731 --> 00:54:30,129
I'm good. How are you?

1282
00:54:30,130 --> 00:54:32,569
Very good.
Happy we found this place.

1283
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,839
Yeah, it's kind of back there,
Isn't it?

1284
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,139
This is my son, leo.

1285
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:38,109
He's come out to help us
Check out some of these cases.

1286
00:54:38,110 --> 00:54:40,139
Hey. Nice to meet you.

1287
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,340
When my dad and I drove up
On kendra's property,

1288
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:45,009
The first thing I noticed is
That one side of her property.

1289
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,349
Is facing other houses,

1290
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:48,419
And the other side is backed up
Against wilderness.

1291
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:49,649
To me, this is perfect.

1292
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:51,690
It's almost like window shopping
For a sasquatch.

1293
00:54:53,860 --> 00:54:56,789
This is the window
That I looked out.

1294
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,029
And seen it standing.

1295
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:00,490
And where was it standing?

1296
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,999
It was standing
Right down in that area.

1297
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,229
Okay.

1298
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:07,230
So, when this happened,
You're inside here.

1299
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,339
And what are you doing?
What's going on?

1300
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,839
It was christmas day,
2:40 in the morning.

1301
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:17,479
I was laying on the bed.

1302
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,849
Me and my husband
Had been talking.

1303
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:23,119
I happened to look over
To my left.

1304
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,990
And when I did,
I seen something standing there.

1305
00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:29,720
It was huge.

1306
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,509
Trail.

1307
00:55:35,510 --> 00:55:37,679
Has had an abundance
Of bigfoot sightings,

1308
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,119
So the team is here
To investigate.

1309
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:41,689
After hearing
A plethora of reports.

1310
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:43,089
Spanning the whole trail,

1311
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:46,420
We decided to call on some
Friends and family for backup.

1312
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:48,189
I flew in my son leo.

1313
00:55:48,190 --> 00:55:49,759
To help me follow up
With a witness.

1314
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,429
Who had a sighting At her house.

1315
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,460
Just a couple of weeks ago.

1316
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:01,240
I look over to my left,
And I seen something huge.

1317
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,409
I looked at it,
And I looked at my husband.

1318
00:56:05,410 --> 00:56:07,509
And I looked back at it.

1319
00:56:07,510 --> 00:56:13,249
It knew I was looking at it,
And it just turned.

1320
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:15,319
And it was gone.

1321
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:20,489
And I watched it for
Probably about 30, 40 seconds.

1322
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:21,589
That's really long.

1323
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:22,629
Wow. Yeah.

1324
00:56:22,630 --> 00:56:24,090
You turned your face
Right toward it,

1325
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,499
And you guys were just
Facing each other?

1326
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,560
Right.

1327
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:28,099
So, what exactly
Did that look like?

1328
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,939
Its face was not
Covered all in fur.

1329
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:36,770
Around in here,
It was a darker flesh color.

1330
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,609
So it was kind of like
A big, bulky, man-shaped thing,

1331
00:56:39,610 --> 00:56:42,179
Just with fur all over it,
Except for around in here?

1332
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,180
Yes.

1333
00:56:43,181 --> 00:56:44,749
How tall Do you think it was?

1334
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:46,949
As I looked out
The bedroom window,

1335
00:56:46,950 --> 00:56:49,050
It was taller
Than the bird feeder.

1336
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:54,089
Then that's a big animal.

1337
00:56:54,090 --> 00:56:54,990
Definitely.

1338
00:56:54,991 --> 00:56:57,259
And I got my husband up.

1339
00:56:57,260 --> 00:57:00,229
And I told him, "There's
Something red out there".

1340
00:57:00,230 --> 00:57:01,799
And that "It's huge."

1341
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:05,639
And he comes out On the porch,

1342
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:09,070
And he could hear it take off
In the woods that direction.

1343
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,409
It went down the hill
Through the woods?

1344
00:57:10,410 --> 00:57:11,410
Yes.

1345
00:57:13,380 --> 00:57:14,779
So, what is off that way?

1346
00:57:14,780 --> 00:57:17,479
Is it just pure wilderness,
Or is there more houses?

1347
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:21,849
There's nothing from there
Way on down in the woods.

1348
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:23,389
Wow. Yeah.

1349
00:57:23,390 --> 00:57:25,489
You know, I'd really like
To get a better perspective.

1350
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:26,989
On what you saw.

1351
00:57:26,990 --> 00:57:28,129
So, what we could do is,

1352
00:57:28,130 --> 00:57:29,890
Leo, would you mind
Standing down there?

1353
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:32,699
We'll tell you
Where to position yourself.

1354
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:33,799
And we'll go back in there.

1355
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:36,530
And have a look
At where her eye line was.

1356
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:37,939
And get a feel
For how big it was.

1357
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:38,969
And what it was doing.

1358
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:39,970
Yeah. It sounds good.
I'll do it.

1359
00:57:39,971 --> 00:57:42,809
All right. Let's head on in.

1360
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:45,609
Kendra says that what she saw
Was about 7 or 8 feet tall.

1361
00:57:45,610 --> 00:57:47,079
One thing I've learned
From my dad.

1362
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,449
Is that people can be a little
Inaccurate with measurements,

1363
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:51,349
So I'm gonna stand in
For the sasquatch,

1364
00:57:51,350 --> 00:57:52,980
Then see if it matches up.

1365
00:57:52,990 --> 00:57:57,589
Wow. And your head is Nowhere
near the top Of this bird feeder.

1366
00:57:57,590 --> 00:57:59,689
It might have been a 9-footer.

1367
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:02,729
Leo, are you able to find any
Kind of a stick around there?

1368
00:58:02,730 --> 00:58:05,159
Well, I see some over here.

1369
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,899
Okay, yeah.
Raise that stick up slowly.

1370
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,130
Until I tell you to stop.

1371
00:58:09,140 --> 00:58:10,499
Is that... more? Yes.

1372
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,869
More? About right there.

1373
00:58:11,870 --> 00:58:13,939
Yeah, right in there.

1374
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:15,269
Boy.

1375
00:58:15,270 --> 00:58:17,439
That was a big one.

1376
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:20,940
Yes, that was a tall,
Full-grown sasquatch.

1377
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:23,949
I've heard that these things
Are 7 or 8, even 9 feet tall.

1378
00:58:23,950 --> 00:58:25,949
But once you see
How tall that stick is,

1379
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:28,319
It really hits you
That this thing is giant.

1380
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,819
And, boy, I would not want
To be out in the wilderness.

1381
00:58:30,820 --> 00:58:32,159
With one of those things.

1382
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:34,990
Okay. Let's try and get a gauge
On how wide it was.

1383
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:40,460
Stop.

1384
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:42,129
Right there.

1385
00:58:42,130 --> 00:58:43,169
Wow.

1386
00:58:43,170 --> 00:58:46,039
That's definitely An adult.

1387
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,909
That's a big, tall, Wide thing.

1388
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,709
I'd say about 4 feet.

1389
00:58:49,710 --> 00:58:52,379
I'm so used to bobo helping us
With the size comparison,

1390
00:58:52,380 --> 00:58:54,549
So it was kind of new
With leo doing it.

1391
00:58:54,550 --> 00:58:55,979
But he did a great job.

1392
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:56,910
Great. We're coming out.

1393
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:57,949
All right.

1394
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:59,149
And, you know,
Even bobo would have.

1395
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:00,980
Had to get a stick
In this situation.

1396
00:59:00,990 --> 00:59:04,189
That was a tall critter
Outside this window.

1397
00:59:04,190 --> 00:59:06,620
Well, kendra, coming here,
Hearing your story,

1398
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:09,089
Especially Seeing this place,

1399
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:11,959
I have absolutely no doubt
There was a sasquatch here.

1400
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,529
There is definitely
Bigfoot here.

1401
00:59:14,530 --> 00:59:17,469
No doubt about it,
Kendra saw a sasquatch.

1402
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,700
And she told us that
Other neighbors around here.

1403
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,569
Have seen them also.

1404
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:23,039
So, that's great.

1405
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,779
This is the perfect spot
To keep investigating.

1406
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:30,010
So leo and I are gonna cruise
Around in a car in this area.

1407
00:59:30,020 --> 00:59:32,019
In order to cover more ground.

1408
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:33,880
Meanwhile,
Cliff and his brother rob.

1409
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,019
Are gonna head out
On a night investigation.

1410
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:38,190
In rex and david's spot.

1411
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:57,070
Do you see anything?

1412
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,979
Just trees.

1413
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:00,240
That's the great thing
About this spot.

1414
01:00:00,250 --> 01:00:02,949
It's so thick.
Anything could be out there.

1415
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:04,049
Can I take a look
Through the therm.

1416
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:05,449
To see What you're not seeing?

1417
01:00:05,450 --> 01:00:07,249
Yeah.

1418
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:09,219
Are you seeing anything?

1419
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,389
A lot of nothing.
Because the lens cap is on.

1420
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:12,689
That would do it, Wouldn't it?

1421
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,730
There you go. Much better.

1422
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:16,590
Now I see it.

1423
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:19,560
Why don't you film me.

1424
01:00:19,570 --> 01:00:21,969
So you can kind of see
What a mammal would look like.

1425
01:00:21,970 --> 01:00:23,969
Well, do a little dance for me
Or something.

1426
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:26,000
Here, look, I'll do this.

1427
01:00:26,010 --> 01:00:27,200
And watch.

1428
01:00:28,110 --> 01:00:30,070
Kind of cool. Yeah.

1429
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:31,710
Cool. Thanks, bud. Kind of cool.

1430
01:00:37,950 --> 01:00:40,449
Leo, we're not terribly far away
From kendra's place.

1431
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:43,089
It's just across the river
In this direction.

1432
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:44,689
I noticed On the aerial photos.

1433
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:48,359
That there's an area with just
Big, open meadows up ahead.

1434
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,699
I'm guessing there's probably
Gonna be deer in there.

1435
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,360
And that's the area,
Around the perimeter,

1436
01:00:53,370 --> 01:00:54,499
That you want to look
With the thermal.

1437
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:55,799
Okay.

1438
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:58,069
And if you see a heat blip,
Just tell me to stop.

1439
01:00:58,070 --> 01:00:59,369
So, you got a grip
On the controls?

1440
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:00,569
Yep, yep.

1441
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,239
Okay. But go ahead,
Start therming out the side.

1442
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,939
Look in the woods
To tell me if you spot deer.

1443
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:07,779
Leo's been with me
On a few big expeditions,

1444
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,079
But this is the first time.

1445
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:11,949
It's just been him and I
Going around, and it's great.

1446
01:01:11,950 --> 01:01:14,719
He's getting to see
What I did for a lot of years,

1447
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,919
Beginning about his age.

1448
01:01:16,920 --> 01:01:20,959
So, I think the last time
You came out with me,

1449
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:23,629
We went out... was probably
In washington state, wasn't it,

1450
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:24,799
On the olympic peninsula?

1451
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:27,099
Yeah. When I was 9, I believe.

1452
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,399
We were At the edge of a field,

1453
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:29,769
And the moon Was so bright,

1454
01:01:29,770 --> 01:01:32,399
We didn't need any flashlights
Or thermals or anything.

1455
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,939
It was amazing.

1456
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,940
Yep, this field is cold.

1457
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:42,749
Look, look, look.

1458
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,110
There's turkey tracks
Over there.

1459
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:45,379
Yep.

1460
01:01:45,380 --> 01:01:46,480
So that means
There's turkeys around.

1461
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:48,519
Those are in the snow, so...

1462
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,719
That's good.
Look for those, too.

1463
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,889
That's good food For 'squatches.

1464
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,089
You bet.

1465
01:01:54,090 --> 01:01:55,889
Do you mind if I, like, Get out.

1466
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,329
And sit on this
For a little bit?

1467
01:01:57,330 --> 01:01:59,329
Sure.

1468
01:01:59,330 --> 01:02:02,569
Don't drop that therm. I won't.

1469
01:02:02,570 --> 01:02:04,700
Well, that's something
That bobo wouldn't do.

1470
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:08,439
Yep, I see now.

1471
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,809
What?

1472
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,840
There is something.
Yep, yep, yep, yep.

1473
01:02:13,850 --> 01:02:16,349
Horse.

1474
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:17,750
Sure it's a horse? Yeah.

1475
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:21,920
Let's keep a goin'.

1476
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,269
All right, robbie.
See, you can see the water.

1477
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,669
Down there, the lake? Yeah.

1478
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:38,969
That's good For two reasons.

1479
01:02:38,970 --> 01:02:40,739
First of all, If you can see it,

1480
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,509
That means that our sounds are
Gonna go through the trees,

1481
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,509
Because trees
Actually absorb sound.

1482
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,409
Like sponges absorb water.

1483
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:47,579
Yeah. We can see
Right through here,

1484
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:48,609
So that'll be good. Yeah.

1485
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,610
Okay, so,
I'm gonna do the first one,

1486
01:02:50,620 --> 01:02:52,419
We'll wait a little while,
Then you do the second one.

1487
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:53,480
Okay.

1488
01:03:13,210 --> 01:03:14,500
All right. You up for one?

1489
01:03:14,510 --> 01:03:16,209
I'll give it a shot.

1490
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,409
I have no idea what this
Is gonna sound like.

1491
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,840
Well, that's part
Of the fun, isn't it?

1492
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,040
For you.

1493
01:03:22,080 --> 01:03:23,910
Well, bigfooting
Is nothing if not fun.

1494
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:25,280
Okay.

1495
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
You're a natural.

1496
01:03:38,860 --> 01:03:39,900
Beginner's luck.

1497
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,130
Those are geese.

1498
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,269
That sound is traveling
Very well.

1499
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:47,439
See, I think
That's another reason.

1500
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:48,709
That sasquatches
Would want to hang out.

1501
01:03:48,710 --> 01:03:49,739
In a place like this...

1502
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,639
Because
A really well-placed rock,

1503
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,240
You know, would bring a couple
Of those things down.

1504
01:03:53,250 --> 01:03:54,180
If thrown right.

1505
01:03:54,181 --> 01:03:55,479
Boom, goose dinner.

1506
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:56,579
It's like bowling.

1507
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,140
We're close to the edge
Of the lake now.

1508
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:00,449
Would it be a good idea
To go to the lake.

1509
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,719
And try to therm Along the edge.

1510
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:04,250
To see if you get
Any action that way?

1511
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:06,489
You know, why not? Okay.

1512
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,759
And who knows,
Maybe there's even prints.

1513
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,080
Or something like that
Down there.

1514
01:04:16,970 --> 01:04:18,539
Hey, look at that.

1515
01:04:18,540 --> 01:04:21,969
Nice, deep valley In there,

1516
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,809
Real wind protected.

1517
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:25,109
Let's do some howls.

1518
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:26,479
Let's do it.

1519
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:28,950
All right. Here goes nothing.

1520
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:37,390
Yeah.

1521
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,200
Listen! That was definitely one.

1522
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:50,270
Did you hear that?! Yeah.

1523
01:04:53,420 --> 01:04:57,629
North carolina.

1524
01:04:57,630 --> 01:04:59,529
We're investigating
A multitude of sightings.

1525
01:04:59,530 --> 01:05:01,799
Along the appalachian trail.

1526
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,760
While cliff and his brother rob
Explore a property.

1527
01:05:03,770 --> 01:05:06,130
Where bigfoots are said
To repeatedly visit,

1528
01:05:06,140 --> 01:05:09,569
My son leo and I are spending
The night at a location.

1529
01:05:09,570 --> 01:05:12,709
Where a bigfoot was seen
Just weeks ago.

1530
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:15,340
And we just heard
A bigfoot howl.

1531
01:05:19,120 --> 01:05:21,349
Listen! That was definitely one.

1532
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:24,049
Did you hear that?! Yeah.

1533
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,650
Yeah!

1534
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:26,590
Was that...?

1535
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:27,590
It's still going!

1536
01:05:31,330 --> 01:05:33,029
Yeah. That was one.

1537
01:05:33,030 --> 01:05:34,260
Yeah.

1538
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:38,999
No, it was before those.
Those are coyotes.

1539
01:05:39,000 --> 01:05:41,399
There was a further one
That was deeper.

1540
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,609
I think I just heard
My first 'squatch.

1541
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:47,109
Waaaaaaaah!

1542
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,679
We could hear it
In the distance.

1543
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:50,640
And it keeps going and going.

1544
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,910
That's a sasquatch,
No doubt about it.

1545
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,919
It kind of sounds like bobo,
But even bigger.

1546
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,320
It's definitely a 'squatch.

1547
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:02,190
It was deep.

1548
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:07,530
Coyotes are in back of us.
That was over there.

1549
01:06:10,730 --> 01:06:12,970
I'm gonna do it deeper.

1550
01:06:25,510 --> 01:06:26,979
Do it again.

1551
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:29,219
You see how much effort it takes
Driving around,

1552
01:06:29,220 --> 01:06:30,649
Checking things out?

1553
01:06:30,650 --> 01:06:32,519
You're kind of
Narrowing it down,

1554
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,789
And then you just
Get the feeling that,

1555
01:06:33,790 --> 01:06:35,820
Yeah, this looks like the area
They'd be in.

1556
01:06:35,830 --> 01:06:39,290
And then you do it,
And there you hear one.

1557
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:56,479
Well, we have
The water right at us.

1558
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,079
We might as well
Do a couple calls.

1559
01:06:58,080 --> 01:06:59,010
You want to do them?

1560
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,179
Can I whoop it?

1561
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:01,820
You can do Whatever you like.

1562
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,699
That was longer
Than the first one.

1563
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:16,760
That's what she said.

1564
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:30,109
Did you hear that? I heard that.

1565
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:32,410
From that direction,
I heard something.

1566
01:07:32,420 --> 01:07:36,280
We got a response.

1567
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:39,350
There's no other noises, Either.

1568
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:40,750
That was A long ways away.

1569
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,390
Obviously on the other side
Of the lake.

1570
01:07:43,860 --> 01:07:45,129
It couldn't have been An echo...

1571
01:07:45,130 --> 01:07:46,259
No. No, that wasn't An echo.

1572
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,160
That far after.

1573
01:07:47,161 --> 01:07:48,259
How about I try to whoop,

1574
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:49,299
Just to see
If I can get a response?

1575
01:07:49,300 --> 01:07:50,629
Yeah, and plus, you know,

1576
01:07:50,630 --> 01:07:53,099
We need to eliminate The
possibility That that's an echo,

1577
01:07:53,100 --> 01:07:55,139
Because it's possible
That it is.

1578
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,300
You know,
That's a long ways away.

1579
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:57,639
And it might Take that long.

1580
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,440
For the sound
To get over there and back.

1581
01:08:05,850 --> 01:08:07,610
I heard it again.
Maybe that is an echo.

1582
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,280
I think it is.
All right, you know what?

1583
01:08:09,290 --> 01:08:10,680
I thought you might have heard
Your first bigfoot.

1584
01:08:10,690 --> 01:08:12,850
But it turns out
It was just me and an echo.

1585
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:13,950
That stinks.

1586
01:08:13,960 --> 01:08:16,489
Rob's initiation To bigfooting.

1587
01:08:16,490 --> 01:08:18,659
Turns out to be mostly
What bigfooting is...

1588
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:19,729
A walk in the dark.

1589
01:08:19,730 --> 01:08:21,099
But you know what?

1590
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:24,129
I don't tie my success
To only hearing sasquatches.

1591
01:08:24,130 --> 01:08:26,569
Fact is, I got to take
My brother bigfooting.

1592
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,070
Right there is a success.

1593
01:08:32,840 --> 01:08:36,340
We know there's a sasquatch
In this valley right now.

1594
01:08:36,350 --> 01:08:38,509
And if we stick around
And keep making noises,

1595
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:41,479
There's a risk it could
Figure out that we're humans.

1596
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:42,880
There's not much else
We can do tonight.

1597
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:43,980
With just the two of us,

1598
01:08:43,990 --> 01:08:46,150
So we need
To back out of here quietly.

1599
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:48,589
And call it a night for now.

1600
01:08:48,590 --> 01:08:51,789
We need to come back here
Tomorrow with the whole team.

1601
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:54,959
So we can use all that manpower
To our advantage.

1602
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,799
With eight of us out
In the woods.

1603
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:58,699
Making knocks and calls,

1604
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:00,130
That's when we'll have
The best chance.

1605
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:03,540
Of getting another response
Or maybe some thermal footage.

1606
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,549
Matt and leo found.

1607
01:09:16,550 --> 01:09:18,819
The perfect final overnight
Investigation spot,

1608
01:09:18,820 --> 01:09:20,350
So bud and I are
Heading there right now.

1609
01:09:20,360 --> 01:09:22,759
We're bringing along our
Special, secret 'squatch sauce.

1610
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:26,229
Hopefully that stirs us up
Some 'squatch action tonight.

1611
01:09:26,230 --> 01:09:27,759
We've got this spent grain
From the brewery.

1612
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,059
We're gonna spread it
All around the woods.

1613
01:09:29,060 --> 01:09:31,569
Before the sun goes down.

1614
01:09:31,570 --> 01:09:32,870
That one's just right.

1615
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:40,370
Hopefully, that sweet smell
Attracts a 'squatch,

1616
01:09:40,380 --> 01:09:41,639
Because I want to be there.

1617
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,750
When bud has his first ever
'squatch encounter.

1618
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:57,020
All right, folks.

1619
01:09:57,030 --> 01:09:59,329
This is our final night
Here in north carolina,

1620
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:02,660
And it really paid off...
Bringing all the relatives here.

1621
01:10:02,670 --> 01:10:04,499
And split off
Into all these teams...

1622
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:07,530
Because this is where
Leo and I heard this howl.

1623
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,200
In this area where leo and I
Heard the howls,

1624
01:10:10,210 --> 01:10:13,709
There's a railroad track
Running across the mountainside,

1625
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,840
So we're gonna split up
Into three groups.

1626
01:10:15,850 --> 01:10:19,549
Bobo and bud are gonna walk
One way down this railroad bed.

1627
01:10:19,550 --> 01:10:20,949
Ranae and laura are gonna go
Another way.

1628
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:22,549
Along the railroad bed.

1629
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,589
And the third team, Leo and I
and cliff And his brother rob,

1630
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:27,489
Are gonna go up the mountainside.

1631
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:30,559
To get as high up as possible
Toward an apple orchard.

1632
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:32,259
That's on the rim Of the canyon.

1633
01:10:32,260 --> 01:10:33,390
Watch out For that ice there.

1634
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:35,100
Whoa.

1635
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:42,770
There are stories,

1636
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:44,069
Some are even from hope,
Where I live,

1637
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:46,409
Of abandoned railroads,

1638
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:48,839
With these caves
That are really remote,

1639
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,379
With 'squatches building beds
Inside of them.

1640
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:53,110
But I think
This thing's still used,

1641
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,349
So they wouldn't Live here.

1642
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:56,649
But they would definitely
Walk through here at night,

1643
01:10:56,650 --> 01:10:59,319
Just like we're doing.

1644
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,259
Whoa, what's that?

1645
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:02,820
- What is that?
- Get my light.

1646
01:11:04,330 --> 01:11:05,759
It's ice.

1647
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:07,259
Look at those icicles.

1648
01:11:07,260 --> 01:11:09,900
That's rad. Way up there.

1649
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,069
Dude, a couple
Of those big ice spears,

1650
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:20,839
Those like 6-foot ones,

1651
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:22,879
They could fall at any second
And just kill you.

1652
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:23,840
Yeah.

1653
01:11:23,850 --> 01:11:25,610
Definitely would, too.

1654
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,419
Dude, I can't see anything.

1655
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:30,250
I know.

1656
01:11:30,250 --> 01:11:31,250
Whoa!

1657
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:36,290
Where are you?

1658
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:39,390
You okay?

1659
01:11:39,400 --> 01:11:40,400
Yeah. I'm all right.

1660
01:11:45,230 --> 01:11:47,699
I mean, right now,
We're on this open...

1661
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,139
Yeah... Area.

1662
01:11:49,140 --> 01:11:51,669
But you got an idea of it moving
Through the brush a few times,

1663
01:11:51,670 --> 01:11:52,770
We were doing that.

1664
01:11:52,780 --> 01:11:53,770
There's been sections
Where it is...

1665
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:54,740
My god.

1666
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:55,640
Sorry.

1667
01:11:55,641 --> 01:11:57,809
What was that?

1668
01:11:57,810 --> 01:11:59,349
I'm sorry.

1669
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:02,149
I literally felt something
Pushing into my back.

1670
01:12:02,150 --> 01:12:04,580
Really? Like a ghost? Yeah.

1671
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,019
Was it this?
Because I was trying...

1672
01:12:08,020 --> 01:12:09,859
Something vibrated In my pack.

1673
01:12:09,860 --> 01:12:11,759
This vibrated.
I bet you this thing went off.

1674
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:13,559
It's attached.

1675
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,699
Watch. I did this.

1676
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:17,160
Is that what you felt? Yes.

1677
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,799
Did you grab it,
And I didn't even see it?

1678
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,600
Yes, and I was trying
To talk to you.

1679
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,870
That was scary.

1680
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:31,240
Look at that. Okay.

1681
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,949
Couldn't have a better
Acoustical position than here.

1682
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,349
So, rob, I mean,

1683
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:37,119
I've been doing this
For over 20-something years.

1684
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:39,119
This is only the second time
You've been out.

1685
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:40,819
Hey, why don't you
Invite me more?

1686
01:12:40,820 --> 01:12:41,859
I don't know. I guess...

1687
01:12:41,860 --> 01:12:42,989
That's right.
I don't want to go.

1688
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:44,159
That's right.

1689
01:12:44,160 --> 01:12:45,489
Well, now you see
Why you don't want to go.

1690
01:12:45,490 --> 01:12:46,490
It's too cold.

1691
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:48,129
Did you think it was
This glamorous?

1692
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,800
The glamour Is overwhelming.

1693
01:12:51,030 --> 01:12:53,330
Cliff, I think you were
The first one.

1694
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:59,470
To ever bring me out
On my own little expedition,

1695
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:01,809
And it was amazing.

1696
01:13:01,810 --> 01:13:03,709
Hey, matt, Can you copy me?

1697
01:13:03,710 --> 01:13:05,009
Hey, it's bobo.

1698
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,819
Yeah, bobo, we copy.
Ranae, do you copy?

1699
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,449
Go for ranae.

1700
01:13:10,450 --> 01:13:11,949
Okay, bobo, hang on.

1701
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:13,550
Ranae's further up The canyon.

1702
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:15,119
We're gonna Talk to her first.

1703
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,089
Ranae, have you got a tree
Nearby you can hit.

1704
01:13:17,090 --> 01:13:19,959
That'll be loud?

1705
01:13:19,960 --> 01:13:22,329
No, but I can use These rocks.

1706
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:25,399
You're gonna damage your
'squatch stick, but go ahead.

1707
01:13:25,400 --> 01:13:26,370
We'll listen.

1708
01:13:26,371 --> 01:13:28,370
Here I go in 10.

1709
01:13:32,340 --> 01:13:33,939
Yeah, I heard it that way.

1710
01:13:33,940 --> 01:13:35,909
- You did?
- Yeah.

1711
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:38,179
Definitely sounded Like a rock.

1712
01:13:38,180 --> 01:13:40,279
It's good to have young ears
On the team.

1713
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:42,319
Did you hear that, matt?

1714
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,049
Leo's young ears heard it,
But the rest of us didn't.

1715
01:13:45,050 --> 01:13:46,650
Way to go, leo.

1716
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:49,159
Okay, bobo,
Go ahead and do yours.

1717
01:13:49,160 --> 01:13:50,860
Copy. Coming up.

1718
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:56,500
Yeah, heard it.

1719
01:13:56,501 --> 01:13:58,229
You heard it?

1720
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:00,199
Even with the hood on?

1721
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:01,439
It was like A low.

1722
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,169
Holy smokes. Leo, good job.

1723
01:14:04,170 --> 01:14:05,809
I been in places
Where you could hear things.

1724
01:14:05,810 --> 01:14:07,070
That I couldn't.

1725
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,579
Well, make sure that you keep
Your amplifier volume low,

1726
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,240
And don't ruin those ears.

1727
01:14:11,250 --> 01:14:13,879
Yeah. That's pretty good.

1728
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:16,749
All right. We're gonna do one
From up here.

1729
01:14:16,750 --> 01:14:17,880
Here you go.

1730
01:14:17,890 --> 01:14:20,220
I will make my first attempt
At a knock.

1731
01:14:23,690 --> 01:14:25,089
Done.

1732
01:14:25,090 --> 01:14:27,590
Negative. I did not hear you.

1733
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:29,230
These two old ears
Heard nothing.

1734
01:14:32,630 --> 01:14:33,630
That was pretty good.

1735
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:34,700
Shush!

1736
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:37,469
I thought I heard something.

1737
01:14:37,470 --> 01:14:38,509
Yeah. I kind of heard that, too.

1738
01:14:38,510 --> 01:14:40,770
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I did.

1739
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,279
Here, down that way.

1740
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,280
Me, too. Shush.

1741
01:14:47,130 --> 01:14:49,060
Ina.

1742
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:50,930
Following up
On widespread reports.

1743
01:14:50,940 --> 01:14:52,999
Along the appalachian trail.

1744
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:55,039
After receiving
A surplus of reports,

1745
01:14:55,040 --> 01:14:57,470
We called our friends
And family to help.

1746
01:14:57,480 --> 01:14:59,209
In hopes of covering
More ground,

1747
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,779
We split up into three teams
For our final night.

1748
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:03,849
And so far,
The move has paid off,

1749
01:15:03,850 --> 01:15:08,419
As we just heard a vocalization
In response to our wood knocks.

1750
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,249
I thought I heard something.

1751
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:11,319
Yeah. I kind of heard that, too.

1752
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:14,159
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah, I did.

1753
01:15:14,160 --> 01:15:15,589
Here, down that way.

1754
01:15:15,590 --> 01:15:16,630
Me, too. Shush.

1755
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,859
Hey, we heard something
In the distance,

1756
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:21,660
Almost like A bark response,

1757
01:15:21,670 --> 01:15:23,469
So we're gonna have him
Do it again.

1758
01:15:23,470 --> 01:15:25,230
Copy. We're listening.

1759
01:15:28,610 --> 01:15:30,369
Good.

1760
01:15:30,370 --> 01:15:32,070
Done again.

1761
01:15:36,650 --> 01:15:38,179
That's a dog.
That's what it was.

1762
01:15:38,180 --> 01:15:39,180
It was a dog.

1763
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,919
Okay, we got a dog and a cabin
Down in the valley,

1764
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,189
But that's okay.

1765
01:15:45,190 --> 01:15:49,390
Only 634 miles
Till we hit miami.

1766
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:54,160
Let's pick up the pace.
We can get there next month.

1767
01:15:54,170 --> 01:15:57,769
There's a long,
Confirmed history.

1768
01:15:57,770 --> 01:15:59,469
Of sasquatch
And railroad tracks.

1769
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:00,700
I can see
Why they would use this.

1770
01:16:00,710 --> 01:16:03,369
It's just like
A sidewalk, you know?

1771
01:16:03,370 --> 01:16:05,539
What are you looking at, Monkey?

1772
01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:07,579
- Wabbit.
- What is that?

1773
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,649
A rabbit?

1774
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:12,210
Or a possum.

1775
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:13,880
I don't think
It's playing possum, either.

1776
01:16:13,890 --> 01:16:16,020
No. I wonder what killed it.

1777
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,859
Something smashed his head,
Chewed his leg.

1778
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,459
His leg's chewed?

1779
01:16:25,460 --> 01:16:26,529
You're right.

1780
01:16:26,530 --> 01:16:28,360
But then they stopped.

1781
01:16:28,370 --> 01:16:30,199
Strange.

1782
01:16:30,200 --> 01:16:32,839
We got to keep our eyes
Peeled and see what else.

1783
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,539
If there's a predator
Utilizing this cave,

1784
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:38,209
We'll see bones on the edge
Or something.

1785
01:16:38,210 --> 01:16:41,210
Good job, monkey.
Find some more stuff.

1786
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:48,280
This'll work. Look at this.

1787
01:16:48,290 --> 01:16:49,349
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1788
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,419
I can see all the way
Down the hill.

1789
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:53,159
Our sounds Are gonna go out.

1790
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,320
Let's do some more knocks
From here.

1791
01:16:54,330 --> 01:16:55,589
Yeah. Good ideal.

1792
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,159
I would hit it, like,
On this end or something.

1793
01:16:57,160 --> 01:16:58,629
We're trying to make it
As loud as we can,

1794
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:00,399
So really swing that thing.

1795
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:01,960
Got a knock coming.
Keep your ears open.

1796
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,399
Knock in five.

1797
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,600
All right.
Leo, that's your cue, man.

1798
01:17:09,340 --> 01:17:10,839
- Beautiful.
- Goodness.

1799
01:17:10,840 --> 01:17:12,909
Done. Did you hear that?

1800
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:16,049
That's a negative.
Don't move... wait.

1801
01:17:16,050 --> 01:17:18,349
What'd you hear?

1802
01:17:18,350 --> 01:17:19,779
A thump?

1803
01:17:19,780 --> 01:17:22,319
Talk to us, leo. What's up?

1804
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,419
A distinct knock.

1805
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:26,189
There. There it was again.

1806
01:17:26,190 --> 01:17:27,959
- A knock?
- There's something.

1807
01:17:27,960 --> 01:17:29,829
I can't tell for sure
If it's a knock.

1808
01:17:29,830 --> 01:17:32,090
But it's definitely...

1809
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:34,229
I heard it... twice.

1810
01:17:34,230 --> 01:17:35,260
Me, too.

1811
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:38,799
We might have gotten
A knock response.

1812
01:17:38,800 --> 01:17:40,299
We did not hear Your knock,

1813
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:43,539
And we did not hear
That possible response.

1814
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,339
Bobo, you got
A place... a tree nearby.

1815
01:17:45,340 --> 01:17:46,739
That you can do Another knock,

1816
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:49,240
Because we're gonna step up
To howls after we do...

1817
01:17:49,250 --> 01:17:51,879
Give knocks
A little more chance.

1818
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,250
Copy.

1819
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:01,490
That sounded better.

1820
01:18:04,600 --> 01:18:06,899
I heard it.

1821
01:18:06,900 --> 01:18:08,700
We heard you that time.

1822
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:13,739
So, that means everything
In the valley heard it, too.

1823
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:15,900
You hear that?

1824
01:18:15,910 --> 01:18:17,970
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1825
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:19,640
Which way?

1826
01:18:22,710 --> 01:18:24,549
Was it coyotes?

1827
01:18:24,550 --> 01:18:25,849
Don't know.

1828
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,480
Hey, ranae, I think it's time.

1829
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:30,289
For you to do a howl,
Not a scream,

1830
01:18:30,290 --> 01:18:33,659
But, like, a long howl
As good as you can do it.

1831
01:18:33,660 --> 01:18:35,890
All right.
I'll do one of those in 10.

1832
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,300
That was impressive.

1833
01:18:49,310 --> 01:18:52,370
Thanks, cuz. Done.

1834
01:18:52,380 --> 01:18:54,640
You're in a very good
Acoustical position.

1835
01:18:54,650 --> 01:18:55,779
We're thinking
You should do it again,

1836
01:18:55,780 --> 01:18:59,180
If you don't mind.

1837
01:19:13,860 --> 01:19:16,999
Can you hear us, bobo?
I hear you.

1838
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:18,899
Do you mind doing
A big, long howl?

1839
01:19:18,900 --> 01:19:20,440
Coming up.

1840
01:19:36,550 --> 01:19:38,190
Darn it.

1841
01:19:41,190 --> 01:19:43,929
I'm telling you,
It was right away last time.

1842
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:47,099
Yeah.

1843
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,230
It is so quiet tonight.

1844
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:53,599
Now we've done a bunch of howls,

1845
01:19:53,600 --> 01:19:56,309
And they really did carry
Through this canyon.

1846
01:19:56,310 --> 01:19:58,339
And we're not hearing
Any responses,

1847
01:19:58,340 --> 01:20:00,039
Not even from coyotes.

1848
01:20:00,040 --> 01:20:02,949
And that's in striking contrast
To a few nights ago,

1849
01:20:02,950 --> 01:20:05,479
Because it was
Right after that first howl.

1850
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:07,619
That we heard
A 'squatch respond one way.

1851
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:10,150
And a bunch of coyotes
From another direction.

1852
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,459
But tonight, nothing.

1853
01:20:15,460 --> 01:20:19,560
Whatever was here a few nights
Ago isn't here anymore.

1854
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,239
Good timing.

1855
01:20:26,240 --> 01:20:28,500
It was like a cemetery mortuary
Where we were.

1856
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:30,539
For up on top, man,
It was pretty quiet.

1857
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:33,039
But when you go bigfooting,
You don't always hear something.

1858
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:34,640
But if you can spend time
In the woods.

1859
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:35,840
With somebody You care about,

1860
01:20:35,850 --> 01:20:37,009
That makes everything Worth it.

1861
01:20:37,010 --> 01:20:38,279
Yeah, I got to say,

1862
01:20:38,280 --> 01:20:39,979
We definitely got to come out
With family again.

1863
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:42,180
Absolutely. I had
A fantastic time with everyone.

1864
01:20:42,190 --> 01:20:43,489
It was great out here.

1865
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:45,889
And the family that 'squatches
Together stays together.

1866
01:20:45,890 --> 01:20:47,689
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, you got that right.

1867
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:49,089
Let's go.

1868
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:53,859
The appalachian trail
Is loaded with 'squatch reports,

1869
01:20:53,860 --> 01:20:55,399
And this north carolina
Expedition.

1870
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:57,599
Just added to that belief.

1871
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,469
But what made this trip
Extra special.

1872
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:01,500
Is we got
To experience this place.

1873
01:21:01,510 --> 01:21:04,209
With our friends and family.

1874
01:21:04,210 --> 01:21:08,210
My son leo heard
His first ever sasquatch howl...

1875
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:11,049
While we were out together.

1876
01:21:11,050 --> 01:21:13,579
On a father-son
Night investigation.

1877
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:17,149
Being there with leo to see
His reaction was priceless,

1878
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:19,819
An experience I'll never forget.

1879
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:21,189
Yeah.

1880
01:21:21,190 --> 01:21:23,429
All of our night investigations
Here in north carolina.

1881
01:21:23,430 --> 01:21:25,890
Turned up possible evidence
Of bigfoots.

1882
01:21:25,900 --> 01:21:27,359
Bobo and bud heard knocks.

1883
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,729
That were almost certainly
Sasquatch related,

1884
01:21:29,730 --> 01:21:31,400
And I heard howls...

1885
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:34,700
On a couple of occasions.

1886
01:21:40,190 --> 01:21:43,299
Welcome to
The "Finding bigfoot" aftershow,

1887
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:46,099
Where the team answers
Questions from their fans.

1888
01:21:46,100 --> 01:21:48,669
Okay, whitney t. From facebook
Wants to know,

1889
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,339
"You guys were back
In north carolina."

1890
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:52,369
By the appalachian trail.

1891
01:21:52,370 --> 01:21:54,970
"What makes that area
So good for bigfoots?"

1892
01:21:54,980 --> 01:21:56,239
You guys know this.

1893
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:57,779
Yeah, we hear it everywhere
We go on the east coast,

1894
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,449
I mean, from georgia,
North carolina,

1895
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:00,749
New jersey, pennsylvania,

1896
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:03,279
New york, connecticut,
Vermont, maine.

1897
01:22:03,280 --> 01:22:05,480
They all had great witnesses
That we heard from.

1898
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:06,649
Right along that trail.

1899
01:22:06,650 --> 01:22:09,150
One moment that really
Stood out for me,

1900
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:11,689
We were with 'boon-'boon
Up in new york state.

1901
01:22:11,690 --> 01:22:14,459
This baboon is gonna shriek
Like crazy.

1902
01:22:14,460 --> 01:22:16,559
It's gonna carry down
This long rift valley,

1903
01:22:16,560 --> 01:22:19,029
And the appalachian trail
Goes right through here.

1904
01:22:19,030 --> 01:22:20,630
This is the spot To do this.

1905
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,800
Okay, 'boon-'boon,
Do your stuff.

1906
01:22:25,810 --> 01:22:27,069
Yeah. That's got to work.

1907
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:29,609
And in georgia...
Upper chattahoochee drainage.

1908
01:22:29,610 --> 01:22:32,040
Remember we were there?
Definite knocks.

1909
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,309
What was that place...

1910
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:35,410
There was that preserve
Right outside of helen.

1911
01:22:35,420 --> 01:22:37,819
That wasn't very far away
From the a.T., either.

1912
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:39,749
It suddenly got A lot chillier.

1913
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,620
It did.

1914
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:47,289
Cool. Did you hear that?

1915
01:22:47,290 --> 01:22:49,190
Do you hear something
In that direction?

1916
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,230
I heard that.
Was that farther back?

1917
01:22:53,770 --> 01:22:57,099
I do think there's
A 'squatch in these woods.

1918
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,540
"I do think there's a 'squatch
In these woods."

1919
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:04,540
So, hillary in florida
Is asking,

1920
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:06,309
"Howls or knocks"?

1921
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:08,679
Which one gets us more pumped
To hear in the woods?

1922
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:11,719
If you get knocks
From a 50, 70 yards out,

1923
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:13,319
Like, bam, bam,
You're just like, "Whoa."

1924
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:15,450
But if you get a howl
From close by,

1925
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,989
I don't think
Anything tops that.

1926
01:23:16,990 --> 01:23:18,489
One of the very first times.

1927
01:23:18,490 --> 01:23:20,529
That we actually got knocks
On the show,

1928
01:23:20,530 --> 01:23:21,690
It was when we were
Investigating.

1929
01:23:21,700 --> 01:23:22,959
The new york baby footage.

1930
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:25,529
Those were real close,
And blew both of our minds.

1931
01:23:25,530 --> 01:23:26,769
And, of course,
The producers' minds,

1932
01:23:26,770 --> 01:23:28,030
Because that was the first time
They had heard.

1933
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:29,099
Anything like that. Yeah.

1934
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:31,969
We have fruit. We have protein.

1935
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:34,539
Man, get a couple carbohydrates,
Got a real meal.

1936
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,810
Hell, yeah, dude.
It's my kind of place.

1937
01:23:37,810 --> 01:23:39,040
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1938
01:23:39,050 --> 01:23:40,479
Did you hear that, cliff?
Yeah, I heard that.

1939
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:41,480
Knock over there.

1940
01:23:46,650 --> 01:23:47,890
There it is again.

1941
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:51,559
I got that one.

1942
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:54,790
I got that one.

1943
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:56,559
I didn't get the bead
On the direction.

1944
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,829
Dude, it's right there.

1945
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,269
But also the calls.

1946
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:03,199
When you're hearing calls
From a close-ish distance,

1947
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:04,639
And you're saying,
"That's not a coyote.

1948
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,000
That sounds like
A big guy yelling,".

1949
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,239
Or something like that...

1950
01:24:07,240 --> 01:24:10,409
Like the horse creek howls
At molalla, for example.

1951
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:11,440
Those were close.

1952
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:13,379
They were from
Two different locations.

1953
01:24:13,380 --> 01:24:14,950
And we got a great
Recording of them.

1954
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:23,690
It's behind you.

1955
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:30,159
That's a 'squatch.

1956
01:24:30,160 --> 01:24:32,060
I heard that Clear as day.

1957
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:33,729
That's a 'squatch.

1958
01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,769
And hearing that knock
On bird mountain in vermont.

1959
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,669
And then hearing the things
Coming down and marching,

1960
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:40,070
And it was like,
That was awesome.

1961
01:24:41,740 --> 01:24:45,609
Dude, That was a knock.

1962
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:47,079
There's something
Down there, matt.

1963
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:48,149
Okay. They're moving.

1964
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:49,649
They're moving. They're moving.

1965
01:24:49,650 --> 01:24:52,080
I think they're all going
Downhill, man.

1966
01:24:52,090 --> 01:24:54,819
Maine...
What a great howl I heard.

1967
01:24:54,820 --> 01:24:56,719
It was going toward That swamp.

1968
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,789
It was late at night.
Definitely a 'squatch.

1969
01:24:59,790 --> 01:25:03,099
I didn't get it on thermal,
But, yeah, there was one there.

1970
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,260
And that was the loudest
And closest I think I've had,

1971
01:25:05,270 --> 01:25:07,270
At least
In the last year or two.

1972
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:18,309
Yeah.

1973
01:25:18,310 --> 01:25:19,779
Yeah.

1974
01:25:19,780 --> 01:25:20,850
Baby.

1975
01:25:24,250 --> 01:25:25,749
I don't know which one
Gets me more pumped.

1976
01:25:25,750 --> 01:25:27,489
Who cares?
They all get me pumped.

1977
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:28,689
Yeah.

1978
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:31,820
Okay, several people are
Asking what it was like.

1979
01:25:31,830 --> 01:25:34,159
To be out there with friends
And family members.

1980
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,160
Fun.

1981
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:36,459
Yeah, It was a lot of fun.

1982
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:37,599
Yeah. You know,
What was cool for me.

1983
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:40,499
Was bud actually got
To hear some knocks.

1984
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:41,899
I mean, he's a professional
Percussionist.

1985
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:43,139
He knows sounds.

1986
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:44,600
He was pretty pumped.

1987
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,639
Yes.

1988
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:49,709
Damn.

1989
01:25:49,710 --> 01:25:52,079
That was bad.

1990
01:25:52,080 --> 01:25:54,250
You're a natural, bud.

1991
01:26:00,690 --> 01:26:02,089
Dude, you hear that?

1992
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:03,459
I did.

1993
01:26:03,460 --> 01:26:05,820
That sounded like
Wood on wood to me,

1994
01:26:05,830 --> 01:26:09,090
Like knock, knock, Knock, knock.

1995
01:26:09,100 --> 01:26:11,699
I think there was four.

1996
01:26:11,700 --> 01:26:13,899
I heard four.

1997
01:26:13,900 --> 01:26:15,699
The moment
That stands out for me...

1998
01:26:15,700 --> 01:26:18,600
I was out on those railroad
Tracks with laura.

1999
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,069
And she has Three older brothers.

2000
01:26:20,070 --> 01:26:22,370
Who have terrified her
Her entire life.

2001
01:26:22,380 --> 01:26:24,840
She thought I was just gonna
Be pranking her all night long.

2002
01:26:24,850 --> 01:26:27,679
I mean, right now,
We're on this open...

2003
01:26:27,680 --> 01:26:29,110
Yeah... Area.

2004
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:31,719
But you got an idea about moving
Through the brush a few times,

2005
01:26:31,720 --> 01:26:32,680
We were doing that.

2006
01:26:32,690 --> 01:26:33,620
There's sections Where it is...

2007
01:26:33,621 --> 01:26:34,719
My god.

2008
01:26:34,720 --> 01:26:35,620
Sorry.

2009
01:26:35,621 --> 01:26:37,720
What was that?

2010
01:26:37,730 --> 01:26:39,320
I'm sorry.

2011
01:26:39,330 --> 01:26:41,959
I literally felt something
Pushing into my back.

2012
01:26:41,960 --> 01:26:43,629
She felt something
On her low back

2013
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:45,499
'cause I was moving the arm,
And it terrified her.

2014
01:26:45,500 --> 01:26:46,699
She literally Went running.

2015
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:49,199
She thought something
Was coming after her.

2016
01:26:49,200 --> 01:26:50,200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

2017
01:26:50,201 --> 01:26:51,739
It was golden.

2018
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,469
For me, it was great,

2019
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:57,779
Because leo got to Hear a
'squatch for The very first time.

2020
01:26:57,780 --> 01:26:59,209
And it came right away.

2021
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,879
I howled, and that thing
Came howling back.

2022
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:04,219
It was just as good
As an ohio howl.

2023
01:27:04,220 --> 01:27:06,119
That was a 'squatch,
And he got to hear it,

2024
01:27:06,120 --> 01:27:07,550
And there was no doubt About it.

2025
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:14,229
Listen! That was definitely one.

2026
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:15,890
Did you hear that?! Yeah.

2027
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,029
Yeah!

2028
01:27:19,030 --> 01:27:20,530
Was that...? It's still going.

2029
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:25,839
Yeah. That was one.

2030
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:27,539
Yeah.

2031
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:29,570
I think I just heard
My first 'squatch.

2032
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:30,979
He was excited.

2033
01:27:30,980 --> 01:27:32,909
<I>He can finally can go home
And go, "My dad isn't crazy!"</I>

2034
01:27:32,910 --> 01:27:34,980
Or "...As crazy I thought."
