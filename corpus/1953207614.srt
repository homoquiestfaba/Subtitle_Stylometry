1
00:00:59,727 --> 00:01:03,959
- I feel within me
many different people ...

2
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:09,798
.. a mulitude of beings and each
would make their own way.

3
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:18,962
- The strangest thing is that they all
speak at once, but not all together ...

4
00:01:20,447 --> 00:01:26,044
.. they interrupt, contradict
and merge into a great tumult.

5
00:01:27,407 --> 00:01:29,398
- What can I do?

6
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:40,280
- I remember
when I was 12.

7
00:01:40,407 --> 00:01:46,277
- I was a quiet child, but each
day I was punished by my father.

8
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:50,917
- We Uzeda's were an old
family of Spanish origin ...

9
00:01:51,047 --> 00:01:54,483
.. who had been living in Catania
for more than 100 years ...

10
00:01:54,607 --> 00:01:58,885
.. so said my grandmother,
the Princess of Francalanza.

11
00:01:59,407 --> 00:02:05,004
- ltaly was divided in several states
and Sicily was ruled by the Bourbons.

12
00:02:05,127 --> 00:02:10,281
Raimondo
do not leave me, please!

13
00:02:10,407 --> 00:02:16,164
Princess, I am not Raimondo I am
Casimiro your faithful servant!

14
00:02:16,287 --> 00:02:19,643
- Baldassarre, who suffered
to see me punished ...

15
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,679
.. was the son of my grandfather
and a maid ...

16
00:02:22,807 --> 00:02:26,482
.. but forced to work as a butler
on the orders of my father.

17
00:02:26,607 --> 00:02:31,476
- Dear Prince, just a few more feet!
- Why?

18
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:36,920
Why .. because your father wants to make
a man of you. You know he loves you very much.

19
00:02:37,047 --> 00:02:41,006
-I think he really hates me!
- No!

20
00:02:43,887 --> 00:02:46,765
Come, my darling, let me see.

21
00:02:48,407 --> 00:02:50,921
Does it hurt much?

22
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:56,599
Consalvo!

23
00:02:56,727 --> 00:03:01,721
- What?
- The coach is leaving, look!

24
00:03:05,007 --> 00:03:09,205
- Where is our father now?
- Something serious happened.

25
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:14,125
- Why lower our flag?
- It means that someone died.

26
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:18,240
- Who?
- Try to imagine. - Grandma?

27
00:03:50,167 --> 00:03:56,276
- Our father is talking to grandma.
- No, he is praying.

28
00:03:56,407 --> 00:03:59,479
The feud Ganci, 7,000 ounces ...

29
00:03:59,607 --> 00:04:05,443
.. Palazzolo's estate, at least 10,000.
You would have taken it to the grave!

30
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:07,523
Damn!

31
00:04:13,887 --> 00:04:15,718
Behave!

32
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:22,116
Is it true that your aunt Lucretia
is in love with lawyer Giulente ...

33
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:26,206
.. But they will not let her marry?
- Yes, Watch it, poor thing!

34
00:04:33,287 --> 00:04:36,199
- And your Aunt Clara?
- This is her third pregnancy.

35
00:04:36,327 --> 00:04:39,205
The children are always stillborn!

36
00:04:39,327 --> 00:04:44,560
Smile! We need to give a tip to
the undertaker who prepared ...

37
00:04:44,687 --> 00:04:48,965
Maybe one day he will do us
a great service!

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:05:01,684
-Your father's uncles.
-The reading of the will cause a fight!

39
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:10,246
Uncle Raimondo is
Grandma's favorite son.

40
00:05:10,367 --> 00:05:14,565
He just came back from Florence.
I want to be like him.

41
00:05:15,207 --> 00:05:19,166
I want to travel, have fun, and
meet new people ...

42
00:05:22,407 --> 00:05:27,401
- They say he betrayed poor
Dona lsabella Matilda ...

43
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,121
.. the wife of Count Fersen.

44
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:38,281
- Because Giacomo loved us all here?
- He did not say.

45
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:44,482
-The will stipulates the division of assets.
- Calm down, please.

46
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:51,760
-Watch your brother or he will take everything!
- Do not worry. Giacomo will do everything right.

47
00:05:51,887 --> 00:05:54,560
You're a dreamer! Do not come
and complain to me later!

48
00:05:57,327 --> 00:06:02,560
Silence, please.
Mr. Notary, we can begin.

49
00:06:05,447 --> 00:06:08,439
"I the undersigned Teresa
Uzeda born Rizza..."

50
00:06:08,567 --> 00:06:12,242
".. widow of Consalvo Vll,
Prince of Francalanza ... "

51
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:17,566
".. being of sound mind,
command and order ... "

52
00:06:23,407 --> 00:06:28,356
Your grandmother has left Raimondo
half the estate!

53
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:33,607
-Your father has been duped!
-What does that mean?

54
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,719
When you grow up you'll understand!

55
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:43,677
- Poor Giacomo! - The law is the law.
-He must split the family's assets with Raimondo...

56
00:06:43,807 --> 00:06:47,436
- Your own home!
- We shall see yours!

57
00:06:55,327 --> 00:07:00,196
- I will have the administrator
divide the property immediately.
-I trust you completely.

58
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:04,445
Now I will wait in the ?,
You think of everything.

59
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:09,516
Father, what does it mean
that you have been duped?

60
00:07:10,887 --> 00:07:15,677
-Shut up! What are you doing here?
-Waiting for mother.

61
00:07:15,807 --> 00:07:20,164
-When will you return to the monastery,
Giovannino? -This evening, uncle.

62
00:07:20,287 --> 00:07:25,281
Your mother makes you go too often,
if your father was still alive ...

63
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:32,606
If you continue to make me angry, I'll
send you to the monastery like your cousin!

64
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:41,962
The monastery never!

65
00:07:42,087 --> 00:07:45,762
Must I share the ownership of Aci Trezza
with my brother Raimondo?

66
00:07:45,887 --> 00:07:49,118
Unfortunately the law of primogeniture
has been abolished ...

67
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,719
.. Your Excellency can not claim rights
that once belonged to the first born ...

68
00:07:54,847 --> 00:07:58,237
.. but there is
a way to limit the damage.

69
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:02,201
Your mother entrusted these papers
to me to destroy, Your Excellency.

70
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:07,526
They are IOUs.
Look at the signature of consent.

71
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:11,162
Just delete it
and they will be again as before.

72
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:14,962
Turning them all into debts to be paid.

73
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:19,797
Payable by
my brother Raimondo!

74
00:08:19,927 --> 00:08:23,920
If one day your brothers
want their share of the inheritance ...

75
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:29,997
.. They will have to
pay off those debts.

76
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:36,203
My mother made these things?

77
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:42,324
When did my mother ...

78
00:08:53,007 --> 00:08:57,000
- In early July
cholera broke out in Catania ...

79
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:04,923
.. so we decided to take refuge
at Belvedere, our farm near Etna ...

80
00:09:05,047 --> 00:09:09,245
.. where, my father said, cholera
would not reach us.

81
00:09:12,807 --> 00:09:18,518
- For me it was a happy summer,
we children could do as we wanted.

82
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:23,675
- Father was so focused on the problems
with the inheritance he forgot to punish me!

83
00:09:23,807 --> 00:09:29,643
- The bills must be honored, my dear aunt.
- That means mortgaging the estate. - Unfortunately.

84
00:09:29,767 --> 00:09:32,759
- To exclude Raimondo he
sought the support of his relatives ...

85
00:09:32,887 --> 00:09:35,879
.. Dona Ferdinanda and Don Blasco.

86
00:09:37,847 --> 00:09:42,125
- It's better here than in the monastery.
- Your Excellency. I like the monastery ...

87
00:09:42,247 --> 00:09:45,637
.. But if you say so ...
- I say so!

88
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:51,046
- Aunt Clara was about to give birth.
- Do not worry, I'll be fine.

89
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:55,399
- Aunt Matilda was always looking for
her husband. -Have you seen Raimondo?

90
00:09:56,567 --> 00:10:00,401
- No.
- Do not worry, he will return shortly.

91
00:10:00,527 --> 00:10:05,282
- Come on, Michele, follow me!
- Wait! Consalvo!

92
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,081
Consalvo, I can not enter!

93
00:10:21,007 --> 00:10:25,319
- Fortunately my husband took his advice
and we left Catania.

94
00:10:25,447 --> 00:10:29,326
- If we were killed by cholera, I
would have done with the heat!

95
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:33,725
I can not get used to it. In Warsaw, where
I was born, the climate is very different.

96
00:10:36,014 --> 00:10:38,213
Then, Earl?, when do you return to Florence?

97
00:10:38,214 --> 00:10:46,374
Sincerely, Dona Isabella, at one time it gave me pleasure, now the idea just gives me a feeling of emptiness.

98
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:49,872
Tomorrow my husband's hand
with your brother to visit ...

99
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:56,118
How beautiful horses are in the wild!

100
00:10:59,127 --> 00:11:03,040
- Matilda!
- Raimondo, finally!

101
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:08,116
- Where have you been all this time?
- The weather is getting worse ...

102
00:11:08,247 --> 00:11:11,239
.. and if it rained in Catania,
it would be better for cholera.

103
00:11:11,367 --> 00:11:16,316
- Where have you been?
- Don't I have the right to spend time alone?

104
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:19,086
Uncle Raimondo!

105
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:26,521
She lost Dona lsabella
when he was with you to the creek. (?)

106
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:43,038
I will restore him!
Who knows how it'll be looking for!

107
00:11:45,687 --> 00:11:50,442
- Unhappily, you always do damage!
- I only told the truth!

108
00:11:50,567 --> 00:11:54,526
- Shut up!
- Let go!

109
00:12:02,007 --> 00:12:07,559
- Do not worry. You'll be fine.
- But do not leave me alone. - Quiet.

110
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:11,680
- Uncle Luke has arrived!
- Consalvo go slow! - Wait!

111
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:14,924
It is lawyer Giulente.

112
00:12:15,047 --> 00:12:20,519
Let me be the first to greet him.
You are a Uzeda ...

113
00:12:20,647 --> 00:12:25,767
.. and he is just a lawyer! Remember!
- Where is Giacomo?

114
00:12:25,887 --> 00:12:32,725
- Unfortunately came with Dona Isabella's
husband, Count Fersen.
- I want to marry him, Aunt.

115
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:39,964
-You must help me.
- Gentlemen, I have important news.

116
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:44,679
- The reign of the Bourbons is about to end.
- He will not be happy, I hope!

117
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:48,595
This young man asked me to join
the liberal movement.

118
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:54,120
You have joined the revolutionaries?
May I Dona Ferdinanda?

119
00:12:54,247 --> 00:13:00,197
This is not about joining a revolutionary
movement but with the moderate liberals.

120
00:13:00,567 --> 00:13:05,482
Dreamer! The Piedmontese will throw you out
and give you his ass to kiss!

121
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:10,476
- When they have conquered Rome
burned churches and holy places!
- Blasco, do not say this crap!

122
00:13:10,607 --> 00:13:15,476
- Do you think I would put in with those people?
- The Duke is right, believe me.

123
00:13:15,847 --> 00:13:21,001
- I have decided to leave.
- How would it be? - Yes

124
00:13:21,127 --> 00:13:24,324
- Where?
- I want to join the fighting forces.

125
00:13:24,447 --> 00:13:28,486
If there will be a fight,
I want to be with them.

126
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:33,158
But I did not know that I
would have to fight immediately!

127
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:40,324
Because if I were younger,
I would come with you!

128
00:13:40,447 --> 00:13:46,238
If you were younger you would have escaped
the race! I am your brother and I know you well!

129
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:51,566
- Good heavens!
- Countess Clara's waters have broken!
The pains have started.

130
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:54,121
Here we go!

131
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:07,085
Do not worry, Federico.
Everything is going well.

132
00:14:07,207 --> 00:14:10,199
Hopefully it would not end
as before!

133
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:16,322
- Mother I want to go to see Aunt Clara.
- You can not.

134
00:14:16,447 --> 00:14:19,439
- Then I go to play.
- Yes

135
00:14:23,967 --> 00:14:27,277
Federico! The news
reached us the road!

136
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:31,241
- Count Fersen accompanied me
back in his carriage. - Dona Matilda ...

137
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:37,602
- All right? - He suffers terribly. Calm yourself.
- Soon you'll be the happiest man in the world!

138
00:14:37,727 --> 00:14:40,685
- Thanks.
- Where is Raimondo?

139
00:14:40,807 --> 00:14:45,164
He is out riding his horse,
but he will be back soon.

140
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:23,812
Be brave, be brave Clara!

141
00:15:48,327 --> 00:15:52,957
Oh, God! But what is it?

142
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,000
Prince, what are you doing?

143
00:16:04,647 --> 00:16:07,639
If your father finds you here ...
Come, come.

144
00:16:17,927 --> 00:16:21,920
Baldassarre, go to the kitchen.
Get a large bowl.

145
00:16:22,887 --> 00:16:28,086
- and bring all the alcohol in the house.
- What should you do?

146
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:33,561
- The child was a girl. Clara
wants to keep her. - Poor thing!
- What a misfortune!

147
00:16:33,687 --> 00:16:36,326
Will a child never live?

148
00:16:44,807 --> 00:16:47,002
Who can it be?

149
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:58,846
- He has come back.
- Who? - My husband.

150
00:16:58,967 --> 00:17:01,640
There'll be trouble if he finds you!

151
00:17:03,447 --> 00:17:06,245
What are you doing there? Have you gone mad?

152
00:17:06,367 --> 00:17:09,962
A Uzeda can not run away like a thief.

153
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:15,000
Do not spoil me, please! I beg you.
Don't. Please!

154
00:17:28,887 --> 00:17:32,277
Come quickly.

155
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:44,046
- Signor Conte! - What has happened?

156
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:49,878
- Your brother is waiting for you in the study.
- What do you want?

157
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:58,765
Count Fersa, good morning.

158
00:18:09,247 --> 00:18:12,159
What is the urgency?

159
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:16,837
I would not have bothered if the honor
of the family was not at stake.

160
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:24,196
Is this yours? Count Fersa
found it in his room ...

161
00:18:24,327 --> 00:18:27,239
.. Yesterday afternoon when he returned home.

162
00:18:29,887 --> 00:18:35,280
I put everything right so your
wife should not suffer a scandal.

163
00:18:36,287 --> 00:18:40,963
But now you must leave this place,
maybe you should return to Florence.

164
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:45,638
- At least for a while '. - To Florence?
- Do you need any money.

165
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:51,681
Signor Marco will be responsible for you,
but on one condition ...

166
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:57,560
.. the authorization to delegate me
to deal with your share of the inheritance.

167
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:15,519
Say it like it is:
It is better to blackmail than to steal!

168
00:19:15,647 --> 00:19:20,118
You want to
take away what is mine!

169
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:23,842
If you do not sign,
a scandal will errupt!

170
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:29,280
You will have everyone against the family,
the Church and all Catania!

171
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:36,924
If you sign, you have my support
to quell the situation.

172
00:19:38,807 --> 00:19:43,005
Now you must decide whether
to forgive your wife ...

173
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:50,757
.. or to get Fersa
if you prefer.

174
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:18,439
Please.

175
00:20:26,047 --> 00:20:29,596
- Uncle Raimondo, will you take me with you?
- Not today, another time.

176
00:20:29,727 --> 00:20:34,482
- Are you angry because of the handkerchief?
- No, without knowing you helped me.

177
00:20:34,607 --> 00:20:39,601
- How?
- I'll explain, one day, when you are older.

178
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:42,764
- That day Uncle Raimondo
walked away from the villa ...

179
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,721
.. abandoning the poor Matilda
for the wife of Count Fersa.

180
00:20:46,847 --> 00:20:52,240
- My father got what he wanted and from
that day he took command of the whole family.

181
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,600
- It had always been his dream to control
everyone and everything!

182
00:20:56,487 --> 00:20:58,045
Thank you.

183
00:21:00,447 --> 00:21:03,245
Giacomo ...

184
00:21:04,647 --> 00:21:09,084
I ... I must speak to you.

185
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:20,959
- I'm here.
- It is about lawyer Giulente.

186
00:21:24,287 --> 00:21:27,996
- What do you want?
- He wants to know if ...

187
00:21:29,687 --> 00:21:32,599
.. he can ask me to be his wife!

188
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:42,359
Have you ever heard of a Uzeda who
married someone who was not noble?

189
00:21:42,487 --> 00:21:46,116
But Benedetto is a lawyer, and
is an honest and courageous man.

190
00:21:46,487 --> 00:21:48,762
- Yes?
- Yes!

191
00:21:48,887 --> 00:21:52,926
Being honest and courageous
means nothing!

192
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:58,161
- But I ...
- But you What?

193
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:03,759
- Nothing.
- So much the better.

194
00:22:05,487 --> 00:22:08,479
It is late. It is lunch time.
Do not wait.

195
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:15,766
I'll make you change your mind, I swear!

196
00:22:16,687 --> 00:22:20,726
Run all you want, I'll wait here!

197
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:23,042
I have heard!

198
00:22:25,087 --> 00:22:27,043
Bitches!

199
00:22:28,687 --> 00:22:31,520
-Shut up!

200
00:22:33,447 --> 00:22:35,199
Rosa

201
00:22:36,847 --> 00:22:37,996
Rosa

202
00:23:00,407 --> 00:23:06,198
- Why did uncle and Rosa come
into this room? - I do not know.

203
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:24,516
- Is our cousin beautiful?
- Yes, they keep her locked in the closet.

204
00:23:24,647 --> 00:23:28,242
She is a child, she is a fairy.

205
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:31,723
And light as a butterfly,
has smooth skin of a rose ...

206
00:23:31,847 --> 00:23:36,238
.. And blue eyes.
We open the closet and see.

207
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:46,238
-That ugly!
-Consalvo!

208
00:23:46,367 --> 00:23:50,519
- What are they doing? Wretch!
- I want to see my cousin.

209
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:56,563
-You run off to your room!
- Let me go. - This time I'll make you pay!

210
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,359
You'll see!

211
00:24:11,527 --> 00:24:15,440
Bread and water for another day.
Tomorrow morning we go.

212
00:24:16,807 --> 00:24:21,085
What's the matter. Have you lost your voice?
Don't you want to know where you are going?
211th
00:24:22,647 -> 00:24:28,165
You will enter the monastery. The Benedictines
will take care of your education.

213
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:28,165
You will enter the monastery. The Benedictines
will take care of your education.

214
00:24:22,647 --> 00:24:28,165
You will enter the monastery. The Benedictines
will take care of your education.

215
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:36,403
The monastery
will help increase the word!

216
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:44,122
You have not eaten anything!
Your father does this for your own good.

217
00:24:45,607 --> 00:24:50,442
- Or so he thinks.
- He's not like you. He hates me!

218
00:24:53,327 --> 00:24:58,242
I have to kill to be happy?

219
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:02,758
- Do you want me to end in the ground?
- Don't do that  ...

220
00:25:02,887 --> 00:25:06,960
- Why should I go to the monastery?
- There you'll find your cousin.

221
00:25:07,087 --> 00:25:12,036
I am not a second fiddle like
Giovannino! Mama I do not want to go.

222
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:15,921
I don't want to go, I beg you!

223
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:22,361
I can not do anything,
your father has decided. You know him!

224
00:25:34,887 --> 00:25:38,038
- Dear brother!
- Dear nephew.

225
00:25:38,614 --> 00:25:41,215
Do you know that St. Benedict watching us
in these moments ?

226
00:25:47,167 --> 00:25:49,362
- Answer the father.
- No!

227
00:25:51,847 --> 00:25:57,843
- When I was young I did not want to
come here either. - Have you heard?
- Here is your cousin Giovannino.

228
00:25:57,967 --> 00:26:03,246
Fra Carmelo will accompany you to
the monastery. Say goodbye to your father.

229
00:26:13,927 --> 00:26:17,078
Giacomo, come and see
the new library.

230
00:26:27,647 --> 00:26:33,404
- I must shave. - I do not shave like you, I'm not
sheep. - All novices shave their heads.

231
00:26:33,527 --> 00:26:38,282
My cousin Consalvo
does not want to shave his head!

232
00:26:38,407 --> 00:26:41,205
Your Excellency, I beg you, enough!

233
00:27:07,727 --> 00:27:10,525
- I tried too!
- Shh!

234
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:16,202
- Where are you going? - I am like
your brother Michele ... firstborn

235
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:19,239
.. you have no right to keep me here
I'm going.

236
00:27:19,367 --> 00:27:23,280
-You will now.
- If you spy on Fra Carmelo.

237
00:27:23,407 --> 00:27:28,117
Fra Carmelo does not worry at night
who goes out, but who comes in.

238
00:27:28,247 --> 00:27:31,398
Here in the night is like a carnival!
You'll see

239
00:27:31,527 --> 00:27:36,681
- We must hurry,  because they are coming.
- Who? -You will see!

240
00:27:50,047 --> 00:27:52,003
Look at that.

241
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:59,958
You see all those caps? Do you see?

242
00:28:00,087 --> 00:28:05,207
- Well? The monks are returning to the monastery
- They are not monks, they are women.

243
00:28:05,327 --> 00:28:09,445
Women dressed to enter the monastery
without anyone noticing.

244
00:28:09,567 --> 00:28:13,640
- What are you saying? - They are the mistresses
of the monks. - What their lovers?

245
00:28:13,767 --> 00:28:17,760
Yes, their lovers. Do you know what they call
the monks of this monastery?

246
00:28:17,887 --> 00:28:21,641
- The pigs of Christ!
- You're crazy!

247
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:25,203
Your great-uncle even had
a daughter with Carmen!

248
00:28:25,327 --> 00:28:28,637
- Don Blasco?
- Do not you believe me? Follow me!

249
00:28:38,487 --> 00:28:41,559
- Who is that?
- Carmen, his mistress.

250
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,963
And she is married to
the barber of the monastery.

251
00:28:45,087 --> 00:28:48,875
Don Blasco does not give a damn
no matter the monastery ...

252
00:28:49,007 --> 00:28:54,035
.. Forced him to stay here as a child.
- Does Fra Carmelo also have a mistress?

253
00:28:54,167 --> 00:29:00,640
No, he is a saint, even if he is
the bastard brother of Don Blasco.

254
00:29:03,647 --> 00:29:07,799
When I grow up I will
marry your sister Theresa. And you?

255
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:13,479
- I will never marry. - Why?
- My father will want to choose my wife.

256
00:29:13,607 --> 00:29:17,316
Do not worry,
one day everything will change.
254th
00:29:17,447 -> 00:29:22,043
Sooner or later revolution will break out
and we can escape.

257
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:22,043
Sooner or later revolution will break out
and we can escape.

258
00:29:17,447 --> 00:29:22,043
Sooner or later revolution will break out
and we can escape.

259
00:29:22,167 --> 00:29:26,843
- And then? - All will become
equal. I was told by the cook.

260
00:29:27,687 --> 00:29:33,557
- Soon cooks may become to become nobles.
- And what will we cecome ... cooks?

261
00:29:33,687 --> 00:29:37,475
- The nobles will be beheaded.
- Us too?

262
00:29:37,607 --> 00:29:40,838
The cook is my friend. He'll save us.

263
00:29:42,527 --> 00:29:46,520
They pray at this hour?

264
00:29:46,647 --> 00:29:50,606
- They are poor friars, the Capuchins monks.
- So?
261st
00:29:50,727 -> 00:29:55,164
The Rule prescribes that the Benedictine
monks must pray during the night.

265
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:55,164
The Rule prescribes that the Benedictine
monks must pray during the night.

266
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:55,164
The Rule prescribes that the Benedictine
monks must pray during the night.

267
00:29:55,287 --> 00:29:58,597
The Benedictine monks are rich
and don't like to wake up ...

268
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:02,402
.. They have contracted the Capuchins
to pray for them.

269
00:30:02,527 --> 00:30:05,200
You were right, it's a carnival!

270
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:12,003
-Your turn, Serafino.
- It's not my name.

271
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:17,121
Everyone has to take the name of a
saint. Giovaninno Sebastianuccio and is called "Serafino".
267th
00:30:17,247 -> 00:30:20,557
Come on. There.

272
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:20,557
Come on. There.

273
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:20,557
Come on. There.

274
00:30:21,287 --> 00:30:23,278
Stand still.

275
00:30:34,487 --> 00:30:39,197
- That's it! - Bravo, Serafino!
- Not my name.

276
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:41,606
Come on.

277
00:30:43,687 --> 00:30:46,565
Serafino, please keep your head straight!

278
00:31:06,087 --> 00:31:09,363
Serafino, Sebastianuccio!
Garibaldi has arrived!

279
00:31:09,487 --> 00:31:13,002
Close the monastery
or kill us all!

280
00:31:14,367 --> 00:31:18,155
- We are free!
- We are free!

281
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:27,165
Garibaldi has arrived! He is the antichrist.
It is the revolution!

282
00:31:35,407 --> 00:31:39,605
Garibaldi and his excommunicated followers
closed the monastery and stole our riches.

283
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:41,922
Let's take them before they do!

284
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:47,886
- Long live freedom!
- Damn you!

285
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:52,046
- Long live the Bourbons!
- Don Blasco What will we do without you?

286
00:31:53,087 --> 00:31:55,078
We are free!

287
00:31:55,207 --> 00:31:57,402
- In the seven years
spent in the monastery ...

288
00:31:57,527 --> 00:32:01,440
.. many things had happened.
Uncle Raimondo did not return to Catania ...

289
00:32:01,567 --> 00:32:07,324
.. And my father took over the maternal
inheritance leaving the others just crumbs.

290
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:13,602
My sister Teresa said that every month when she
and my mother came to visit me at the monastery.

291
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:19,683
A Bourbon soldier! Catch him!

292
00:32:41,887 --> 00:32:44,640
Death to the Bourbons!

293
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:59,640
Death to the Bourbons! Viva Garibaldi!

294
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:03,442
Come! Viva Garibaldi!

295
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:16,519
- See lawyer Giulente! He lost a leg.
- Viva Garibaldi!

296
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:20,083
With him there's your great-uncle,
Duke Gaspar!

297
00:33:21,927 --> 00:33:26,239
Long live united ltaly!
Viva Sant'Agata!

298
00:33:38,407 --> 00:33:43,720
- What's your name? - Concetta.
- What a beautiful name! My name is Consalvo!

299
00:33:48,167 --> 00:33:54,037
- Are you from Catania? - Sure.
Why is your hair so short?

300
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:59,036
- What? - Why is your hair so short?
- I just escaped from the monastery!

301
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:03,365
- From the monastery? - Yes.
It was my prison!

302
00:34:05,967 --> 00:34:10,518
- Long live freedom!
- Welcome back, Dear Prince.

303
00:34:10,647 --> 00:34:14,196
Rosa, what is going on?

304
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:17,285
Where is my mother?

305
00:34:18,647 --> 00:34:22,640
- A doctor is with your mother.
- The doctor?

306
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:29,563
- Consalvo, what are you doing here?
- What are you doing?

307
00:34:29,687 --> 00:34:33,396
Your father told us to escape,
Catania will be put to the flames.

308
00:34:44,527 --> 00:34:49,601
- She is very delicate. TB has reached the lungs
- But can she travel? - I strongly advise against.

309
00:34:50,327 --> 00:34:53,319
-I'll accompany you.
- Thanks.

310
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:10,160
Mama ...

311
00:35:12,087 --> 00:35:13,202
Mama ...

312
00:35:15,287 --> 00:35:20,759
I am, Consalvo. Speaking ...

313
00:35:24,167 --> 00:35:27,398
What are you doing here?
Have they occupied the monastery?

314
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:32,360
- What have you done?
- He's staying here, do not you see?

315
00:35:32,927 --> 00:35:37,876
- Why did not you warn me?
- The Belvedere air will do you good.

316
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:42,597
The doctor said mama
can not travel.

317
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:47,357
- Let me stay here with her.
- Do you want your head cut off?

318
00:35:47,487 --> 00:35:52,197
-You come with us, get ready.
- I am staying here.

319
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:56,445
We will leave at dawn, do not argue.

320
00:35:58,847 --> 00:36:01,839
Consalvo, you're back!

321
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:04,999
Teresa!

322
00:36:10,007 --> 00:36:14,205
-Come. - No.
- I beg you!

323
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:17,600
- Teresa ...
- Mama.

324
00:36:17,727 --> 00:36:21,356
Consalvo, approach.

325
00:36:24,247 --> 00:36:29,844
Let's pretend ...  your father wants.

326
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:36,006
- Let's go. -Yes, Mother.
- I will always be with you.

327
00:36:37,407 --> 00:36:39,363
I will not leave you again, mama.

328
00:36:42,807 --> 00:36:47,927
Tancredi, stop playing!
Come here, we leave.

329
00:36:48,047 --> 00:36:53,326
- I told you to take care of the suitcases.
- Who is this child?

330
00:36:56,487 --> 00:36:59,718
- I asked who is the child?
- He is the son of Rosa.

331
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:04,637
I did not know that Rosa had a son.
Why does Aunt Clare carry him?

332
00:37:06,207 --> 00:37:09,085
- Teresa answer? - He is the son of
Rosa and Uncle Federico.

333
00:37:11,047 --> 00:37:15,040
Uncle Federico has a son
with his wife's maid?

334
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,364
I wanted it after the
last pregnancy went wrong.

335
00:37:18,487 --> 00:37:22,958
So for Aunt Clara considers he is her son
and she never leaves him to Rosa.

336
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:27,000
It's a monstrosity,
Don't you see?

337
00:38:06,807 --> 00:38:10,800
Dear Giovannino, come ...

338
00:38:17,567 --> 00:38:20,559
to Catania tomorrow ...

339
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:34,360
Do not touch it!

340
00:39:54,087 --> 00:39:57,523
Mama! Mama!

341
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:15,356
- Consalvo!
- Damn!

342
00:41:15,487 --> 00:41:18,081
Come back!

343
00:41:21,287 --> 00:41:26,361
Tomorrow we will return to Catania and
we will bury your mother.

344
00:41:26,487 --> 00:41:29,877
You know it is a great pain
that I have lost her.

345
00:41:30,007 --> 00:41:33,761
But life goes on.

346
00:41:34,247 --> 00:41:39,924
This morning they came to visit me
lawyer Giulente and Uncle Duke.

347
00:41:40,047 --> 00:41:43,596
The lawyer will be appointed
Mayor ...

348
00:41:43,727 --> 00:41:48,926
.. And he assured me that we are in
no danger. We can come back.

349
00:41:49,047 --> 00:41:55,043
We will have a friend in the mayor
and to strengthen this link ...

350
00:41:55,887 --> 00:42:01,996
.. I consented to his marriage
with your Aunt Lucretia.

351
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:05,915
But how? You said no Uzeda ever ...

352
00:42:06,047 --> 00:42:09,084
.. was going to marry
a man without a title?

353
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:13,166
I consented for the sake of the family
and to protect you all.

354
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:17,204
True true, I understand.

355
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:22,803
- You know also your right, Teresina?
- I have a surprise for lawyer Giulente.

356
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:26,124
He can not marry with one leg!

357
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:32,076
Another good news
is that cousin Graziella ...

358
00:42:32,207 --> 00:42:36,325
.. bound by love of  the deceased ...

359
00:42:37,727 --> 00:42:41,436
..  has agreed to take care of us.

360
00:42:43,087 --> 00:42:46,045
We have taken decisions
for your future.

361
00:42:47,087 --> 00:42:52,207
At 16 years
Teresa will go to school.

362
00:42:52,327 --> 00:42:54,716
- But I ...
- You are what?

363
00:42:55,367 --> 00:42:59,121
You, Consalvo, with the new year
start studying again.

364
00:42:59,247 --> 00:43:03,525
Your new mother and I thought ...
Who told you to get up?

365
00:43:11,647 --> 00:43:12,875
Did you say "mother"?

366
00:43:14,727 --> 00:43:18,117
You said "mother"?

367
00:43:19,287 --> 00:43:22,324
My mother is dead! She's dead.

368
00:43:24,247 --> 00:43:27,205
How and who because of ...

369
00:43:29,007 --> 00:43:31,965
.. You know better than me.

370
00:43:37,967 --> 00:43:41,846
The young lady has something to say?
So much the better.

371
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:48,078
- Back in Catania, my father was
always sequesteredin his pharmacy ...

372
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:54,043
.. preparing remedies against the evil eye and
bad luck that he thought I brought.

373
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:08,477
Consalvo, the saint and Reverend Father Antonio
are here to expel the evil from the building.

374
00:44:08,607 --> 00:44:15,080
The evil is completely visible,
without exorcism!

375
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:21,041
- My father squandered the money so
and I had to do with Giovannino!

376
00:44:21,167 --> 00:44:25,957
- He learned that Don Blasco lived joyously
with money stolen from the monastery ...

377
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:31,957
.. With his lover and her husband, who did not mind being cuckolded if it were paid well.

378
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:37,241
- Meanwhile Sicily became
part of a new state, ltaly ...

379
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:41,360
.. And the wind of democracy
had arrived in Catania.

380
00:44:41,487 --> 00:44:45,366
- Welcome, dear aunt.
- What is this? Long live freedom.

381
00:44:45,487 --> 00:44:50,083
Freedom is a word that means
nothing but pleases everyone.

382
00:44:50,207 --> 00:44:55,327
You see, aunt, when the king commanded
the Uzeda's we were his friends ...

383
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:58,644
.. Now that he has sent the beggars
must be their friends.

384
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:02,476
- Turncoat! Traitor!
- What do you say?

385
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:09,240
... Freedom also means now that Italy is
established we must take of our business!

386
00:45:09,367 --> 00:45:14,760
Now come inside. Today cousin Graziella
and I will make a happy announcement.

387
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:23,680
Michele, do not start to eat everything.
Behave yourself!

388
00:45:23,807 --> 00:45:28,358
- Take example by your brother.
- What have I done?

389
00:45:28,487 --> 00:45:31,797
- Giovannino,  have you seen Consalvo?
- Don't worry he will come.

390
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:40,606
He would not want it to spoil the party.
- Not true.

391
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:45,755
So Giacomo, do we want to make
this announcement or not?

392
00:45:50,807 --> 00:45:57,201
As some of you already know,
cousin Graziella cousin and I ...

393
00:45:57,327 --> 00:46:01,002
..  decided to get married.
- Hooray!

394
00:46:03,607 --> 00:46:08,806
But first there's a surprise ...

395
00:46:08,927 --> 00:46:15,446
.. to our beloved mayor and new
family member, lawyer Giulente.

396
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:23,199
I thought of a gift
equal to the task ...

397
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:29,356
Pure mahogany.

398
00:46:32,287 --> 00:46:36,917
- This is for you.
- Thanks. - Hooray!

399
00:46:55,807 --> 00:47:01,882
Is the dog a bit restless. And
my gift for your marriage!

400
00:47:03,647 --> 00:47:07,083
I'm sure you succeed
to tame it in no time.

401
00:47:13,727 --> 00:47:17,276
Baldassarre! Bring it on.

402
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:31,762
Why is this ugly child
in my carriage?

403
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:35,357
- Goodbye, Tancredi.
- Come back soon! - Come on.

404
00:47:38,327 --> 00:47:43,799
- Sale to spend my money partying and idlers.
- Give it time. Change you'll see.

405
00:47:49,087 --> 00:47:55,686
- Stop. Giovannino.
- Where are we going? - To the monastery. Go

406
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:05,723
And  look there is the girl with whom we
danced the night of Garibaldi.  Do you remember?

407
00:48:05,847 --> 00:48:08,839
Beautiful! Cheers!

408
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:14,396
Tomorrow I'll return here
and send an invitation to a hunting lodge.

409
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,519
By God! Look see
the monastery in this state!

410
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:34,278
What desolation!

411
00:48:37,007 --> 00:48:40,283
Consalvo, come and see
where we slept!

412
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:51,202
- Giovaninno Where are you?
- Novices. What is my duty to your Prior?

413
00:48:51,327 --> 00:48:55,206
That indicates the lost sheep
the way of salvation.

414
00:48:55,327 --> 00:49:00,162
Serafino, please head straight and how many
times did I tell you not to drink the Prior's wine!

415
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,085
Bravo, Sebastianuccio!

416
00:49:08,727 --> 00:49:11,639
Fra Carmelo, what are you doing here?

417
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:16,283
We were drive out, but I
stayed here. This is my home.

418
00:49:19,207 --> 00:49:24,235
Do you remember the dormitory?
You stayed here and you there.

419
00:49:26,447 --> 00:49:28,358
Fra 'Carmelo ...

420
00:49:37,327 --> 00:49:39,795
- Where are you taking me?
- Where?

421
00:49:39,927 --> 00:49:44,125
- Celebrating the day of your
Liberation! - We like to joke!

422
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:49,082
- To the port. On to the harbour and
who repents ... is dead! - Gallop!

423
00:49:57,687 --> 00:50:02,363
- What are you doing?
- I can not go there.

424
00:50:02,487 --> 00:50:06,924
- You young people have fun but ...
- There are no other places open at this hour.

425
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:10,960
I'll return to camp outside the monastery.

426
00:50:14,087 --> 00:50:16,840
These are for you. Take them.

427
00:50:18,847 --> 00:50:22,396
But you also have to take something.

428
00:50:32,367 --> 00:50:36,440
You are good, keep it up.

429
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:43,117
To the monastery.

430
00:50:44,967 --> 00:50:47,720
Come on, go.

431
00:51:04,007 --> 00:51:07,363
My husband Poor Orlando! His thoughts
are far away! His mind wavers!

432
00:51:11,287 --> 00:51:16,202
- Do you remember me? - Certainly your Excellency.
- Finally I found you.

433
00:51:16,327 --> 00:51:21,924
- I tried for a while '.
- Why? I wanted to see you.

434
00:51:23,287 --> 00:51:26,802
- Now that I have seen?
- I want to see you again.

435
00:51:29,167 --> 00:51:32,842
- And when?
- Do you know the hunting lodge of my family?

436
00:51:32,967 --> 00:51:37,961
It is on the road to Biruni.
Meet me there tomorrow evening.

437
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:48,197
- I will have a surprise for you.
- Really? -Yes, certainly.

438
00:51:48,327 --> 00:51:50,716
All for you!

439
00:51:52,287 --> 00:51:54,960
So? Will you come?

440
00:52:02,967 --> 00:52:05,117
Tell me what you will!

441
00:52:09,367 --> 00:52:14,202
Do not stand there, is for you.

442
00:52:15,127 --> 00:52:17,038
Is Your Excellency joking?

443
00:52:22,287 --> 00:52:25,677
- I want to try it.
- Here? Now?
440th
00:52:28,047 -> 00:52:32,518
From there there are mirrors,
so you can watch.

444
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:32,518
From there there are mirrors,
so you can watch.

445
00:52:28,047 --> 00:52:32,518
From there there are mirrors,
so you can watch.

446
00:52:33,687 --> 00:52:38,203
- You stay here?
- Sure.

447
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:49,956
Do not be afraid,
you do not do anything.

448
00:53:00,007 --> 00:53:04,478
All right? I come in?

449
00:53:11,247 --> 00:53:14,557
- You're beautiful!
- It would take the shoes ...

450
00:53:14,687 --> 00:53:17,679
No, you're beautiful even so.

451
00:53:19,807 --> 00:53:24,722
- You are the most beautiful I've ever seen!
-You know so many duchesses and princesses
I have known!

452
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:27,759
Can I kiss your hand?

453
00:53:28,087 --> 00:53:31,796
- Why do you always wear gloves?
-So!

454
00:53:46,767 --> 00:53:51,636
If I asked you to marry?

455
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:57,125
- Prince, do not talk nonsense!
- Next, answer.

456
00:53:57,247 --> 00:54:01,320
Prince, if you were to ask my wife, do you know
I would say your father, the prince?

457
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:06,201
- What?
- What are you crazy! -Yes?

458
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:11,117
- Do you think my father commands?
- Parents demand and children must obey.

459
00:54:13,487 --> 00:54:16,479
- Not me.
- You too.

460
00:54:17,207 --> 00:54:19,437
- Not me!
- You too.

461
00:54:22,087 --> 00:54:25,204
- Not me.
- You too. - Not me.

462
00:54:25,327 --> 00:54:28,444
- You too.
- Stop! Not me. - You too.

463
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:32,526
- Not me!
- No!

464
00:54:32,647 --> 00:54:35,605
No! No!

465
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:04,799
- Come on, Concetta ...
- Do not touch me!

466
00:55:05,327 --> 00:55:09,115
Stop crying, calm down.

467
00:55:15,287 --> 00:55:19,758
- Please. - I do not want!
- I will give you even more.

468
00:55:19,887 --> 00:55:21,639
Damn!

469
00:55:32,407 --> 00:55:34,204
Forgive me.

470
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:38,124
Sorry ...

471
00:55:55,527 --> 00:55:58,519
Have you seen the Prince Uzeda?

472
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:17,041
Giovannino ... Michele ...
I'm glad you came.

473
00:56:17,167 --> 00:56:20,000
In Catania the secrets do not last long!

474
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:30,403
If you have judged better
than I am, you're wrong.

475
00:56:31,807 --> 00:56:35,322
Please, Giovannino, drink with me.

476
00:56:41,407 --> 00:56:43,637
Michele give me a cigar.

477
00:56:49,367 --> 00:56:52,996
Michele, try to call a cab.

478
00:56:58,887 --> 00:57:03,756
The brothers of the girl will
retaliate, you have to go.

479
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:08,915
- I do not care. - Do it for me.
- Let me go on. - Next.

480
00:57:10,407 --> 00:57:11,999
Come on!

481
00:57:15,687 --> 00:57:17,678
Come on!

482
00:57:20,327 --> 00:57:22,124
Go!

483
00:57:38,727 --> 00:57:40,604
You paid the coachman?

484
00:57:40,727 --> 00:57:44,402
The girls told me,
Consalvo has sent away the carriage.

485
00:57:53,647 --> 00:57:59,244
- Your Excellency,  we are the brothers of Concetta.
- You nobles do things in a hurry!

486
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:01,961
And without thinking!

487
00:58:22,167 --> 00:58:25,364
Consalvo!

488
00:58:30,927 --> 00:58:32,565
Michele!

489
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:36,164
Help!

490
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:43,764
I do not understand if I feel
more pain or pleasure.

491
00:58:43,887 --> 00:58:46,276
Do not talk.

492
00:58:48,087 --> 00:58:50,362
Hush!

493
00:58:51,887 --> 00:58:54,276
Deep down you know I deserve it.

494
00:59:15,447 --> 00:59:18,439
- Where am I?
- We brought you to the house of aunt Ferdinanda.

495
00:59:18,567 --> 00:59:23,357
- To avoid the wrath of your father.
- Where is aunt Ferdinanda?

496
00:59:23,487 --> 00:59:26,957
- She's gone to your house..
- That is a family reunion.

497
00:59:27,087 --> 00:59:31,205
Your attackers will not find you. We are organizing
punishment for your attackers ...

498
00:59:31,327 --> 00:59:35,684
.. one of these nights ...
- No, you do not.

499
00:59:39,447 --> 00:59:44,123
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

500
00:59:44,967 --> 00:59:48,482
now we must go. Come on, Michael.

501
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:54,603
-Giovannino, thanks.
- What?

502
01:00:02,007 --> 01:00:05,795
- Father, do it again.
- Shut up.

503
01:00:05,927 --> 01:00:09,363
Your brother is a wretch,
who brings bad luck.

504
01:00:09,487 --> 01:00:15,517
We must leave naked and raw!, if you do it again,
There would be no morality.

505
01:00:15,647 --> 01:00:19,242
- Just you talk about morality?
- Yeah.

506
01:00:19,367 --> 01:00:24,964
They wanted to avenge the honor
of their sister ... Right!

507
01:00:25,087 --> 01:00:31,435
- Now that your husband is mayor, he can interceed.
- I marvel at you! Consalvo committed a disgraceful act!

508
01:00:31,567 --> 01:00:35,924
The fact that my husband is the
Mayor does not changed things.
