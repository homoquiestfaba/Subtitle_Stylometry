00:01:08,423 --> 00:01:09,983
Speaks David.

5
00:01:09,983 --> 00:01:11,326
Your neighbor and friend remember?

6
00:01:14,125 --> 00:01:14,925

8
00:01:18,484 --> 00:01:20,164
By the way...

9
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:21,011
When seedlings that message?

10
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:24,154
Go there spent a year.

11
00:01:25,115 --> 00:01:27,014
Do not you think enough time has passed?

12
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:31,266
You can not let what happened ruin your birthdays forever.

13
00:01:32,652 --> 00:01:35,050
I think Rachael would not want to see re so.

14
00:01:38,498 --> 00:01:39,298
Life goes on.

15
00:01:40,341 --> 00:01:41,390
You have to come out of the woodwork.

16
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:44,292
'm Worried about you, Jay.

17
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:47,787
Please do not do this day
opinion the last year.

18
00:01:52,055 --> 00:01:53,604
Have you opened the gift from Rachael?

19
00:01:57,369 --> 00:01:59,419
Do not be looking for it forever.

20
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:03,311
And if something is damaged?

21
00:02:03,963 --> 00:02:05,713
Watch  there is no let it rot.

22
00:02:06,631 --> 00:02:07,590
Anyway...

23
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,859
Brought you some shopping supermecado.

24
00:02:10,393 --> 00:02:13,043
Malta and I also bought you a little present.

25
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:15,446
Nothing too expensive, do not entusiasmes.

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,340
I want you to know that you are not alone.

27
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,455
It is painful enough term lost it.

28
00:02:23,455 --> 00:02:24,994
Do not make us feel that we missed you too.

29
00:02:27,196 --> 00:02:28,446
Happy birthday, buddy.

30
00:03:00,913 --> 00:03:02,762
For our friend: Happy Birthday!

31
00:03:31,755 --> 00:03:33,955
For a new start is necessary to cut the tape.

32
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,267
Come

33
00:08:51,423 --> 00:08:52,622
Make a U-turn.

34
00:08:56,089 --> 00:08:57,289
Make a U-turn.

35
00:08:58,629 --> 00:09:00,579
It's the wrong route to your destination.

36
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:06,220
Make a U-turn.

37
00:09:07,675 --> 00:09:09,625
It's the wrong route to your destination.

38
00:09:14,035 --> 00:09:15,235
Make a U-turn.

39
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:18,512
in the wrong route to your destination.

40
00:11:06,346 --> 00:11:07,296
Good morning, Mr. Guard.

41
00:11:07,296 --> 00:11:08,255
Good day.

42
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:10,069
I done something wrong?

43
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,690
Can not park in this area without a license.

44
00:11:15,186 --> 00:11:18,536
I thought that in a place as isolated as it does not bother anyone.

45
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:21,491
Your papers, please.

46
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:36,204
Thanks for coperação.

47
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:36,685
Have a nice day.

48
00:11:36,948 --> 00:11:38,267
Also.

49
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:43,796
A half a mile, turn left.

50
00:12:09,384 --> 00:12:11,184
Sit wherever you want, I've got it.

51
00:12:21,126 --> 00:12:22,566
Have you chosen?

52
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:23,679
Bring me the number two and a cafe.

53
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:25,773
You got it.

54
00:12:25,773 --> 00:12:26,853
Thank you.

55
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:41,596
What the hell.

56
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:47,486
Stop!

57
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:49,387
Come here!

58
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:56,029
My God. No.

59
00:14:05,659 --> 00:14:06,459
Come on please.

60
00:14:09,609 --> 00:14:10,689
Please

61
00:14:13,212 --> 00:14:14,811
A one kilometer, turn right.

62
00:14:15,594 --> 00:14:16,674
Thank you.

63
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:19,455
Thank you.

64
00:15:19,121 --> 00:15:20,071
Hello, David. I am.

65
00:15:22,372 --> 00:15:24,372
I wanted to thank you for being my friend.

66
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:26,716
And you get tired and never being.

67
00:15:28,281 --> 00:15:31,130
You have noticed that my car
is not in the garage.

68
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:33,584
You must be thinking, where the hell I was.

69
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:37,870
You told me to leave the nest and that's exactly what I did.

70
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:39,936
I do not know where I'm going.

71
00:15:40,945 --> 00:15:42,644
But I wanted to tell you I'm fine.

72
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:44,918
By the way...

73
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,950
Thanks for the reminder.

74
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:49,863
This was right for me.

75
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,390
You soon.

76
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:53,798
Cheers, mate.

77
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:12,047
A half a mile, turn left.

78
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,550
Thank you.

79
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,429
At a quilómetrovivre, turn right.

80
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:43,513
Turn right.

81
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,431
Reached your destination.

82
00:17:22,924 --> 00:17:24,024
Reached your destination.

83
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,647
Reached your destination.

84
00:17:33,373 --> 00:17:34,094
Go there.

85
00:17:43,624 --> 00:17:44,463
Is this?

86
00:18:05,788 --> 00:18:07,348
Damn.

87
00:18:47,315 --> 00:18:48,995
PREVIOUS DAY

88
00:19:35,077 --> 00:19:37,626
as you know, no mobile phones are allowed in class.

89
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:40,444
But your daughter does not respect this rule.

90
00:19:41,336 --> 00:19:42,786
Their conduct is reprehensible.

91
00:19:43,569 --> 00:19:46,369
As such, I hope you enjoy this temporary suspension

92
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,778
To have a serious talk with her.

93
00:19:48,778 --> 00:19:49,100
I'm sorry, but...

94
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:51,106
It's hard to believe.

95
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,856
Not look like a behavior of Lucy

96
00:19:56,412 --> 00:19:58,361
I do not know what might have caused this.

97
00:19:58,978 --> 00:20:00,298
Sorry...

98
00:20:01,427 --> 00:20:02,625
Your Hand?

99
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:05,857
Thank you.

100
00:20:05,857 --> 00:20:07,394
Can I ask what happened?

101
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,229
We had a gas leak in the house. It was last week.

102
00:20:11,912 --> 00:20:13,761
I lit one of those scented candles.

103
00:20:14,736 --> 00:20:15,456
AND BUM!

104
00:20:16,607 --> 00:20:18,506
There was a fireball around me.

105
00:20:19,244 --> 00:20:22,143
Fortunately. Lucy had opened a window moments before.

106
00:20:22,757 --> 00:20:24,307
I was lucky to only burn your hand.

107
00:20:26,394 --> 00:20:28,145
And the hair  hence this ridiculous scarf.

108
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,309
I regret what happened. Must have been a big scare.

109
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:36,506
Do you think that may have changed the behavior of Lucy?

110
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:39,486
I do not see how.

111
00:20:39,486 --> 00:20:40,585
She did not even hurt.

112
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,669
But it could have been tragic.

113
00:20:43,592 --> 00:20:45,942
Feeling close to death can change a person.

114
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,699
Me and Lucy discussed because the window.

115
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,247
Without any reason because of the window.

116
00:20:52,446 --> 00:20:55,346
I was furious because I was too cold and we constipated.

117
00:20:56,953 --> 00:20:59,052
Chid for the closed but ignored me.

118
00:21:01,021 --> 00:21:04,070
Who would guess that in that window would save his life.

119
00:21:05,017 --> 00:21:06,697
Ironic, is not it?

120
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:07,997
Given what happened.

121
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:10,429
Do not suspederei oficiamente.

122
00:21:11,503 --> 00:21:14,453
I think Lucy does not deserve it
it will take a few days off

123
00:21:15,453 --> 00:21:18,252
However I want you to promise that
will take a few days off

124
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:22,185
Not to complicate matters further.

125
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:24,496
We agree?

126
00:21:24,496 --> 00:21:27,722
Course. I really appreciate it and I promise I will again behave well.

127
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:52,729
Lucy.

128
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:57,813
Lucy, are you home?

129
00:22:06,146 --> 00:22:08,246
It told you to
purchasing new curtains?

130
00:22:16,298 --> 00:22:17,548
Lucy.

131
00:22:46,436 --> 00:22:47,686
Lucy.

132
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:02,933
Mother are you doing here?
- What do you think? I'm looking for you.

133
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:03,963
Please, not now.

134
00:23:04,911 --> 00:23:06,760
I want to know who gave you a cellphone.

135
00:23:07,812 --> 00:23:08,772
No one.

136
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,040
So how do you pay it?

137
00:23:11,649 --> 00:23:12,849
I'm not.

138
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:13,223
So who is?

139
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:14,669
No One.

140
00:23:15,287 --> 00:23:18,386
Ena a Free phone and makes calls to
tassel. Fantastic!

141
00:23:19,699 --> 00:23:21,019
Stole it?

142
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:23,128
Of course not!

143
00:23:23,128 --> 00:23:24,583
So what's this? Go!

144
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:27,351
Gave me my boyfriend.

145
00:23:27,872 --> 00:23:30,472
Since  when you have a boyfriend?
- Since last week.

146
00:23:30,472 --> 00:23:31,570
Really? Yes

147
00:23:32,069 --> 00:23:33,819
I wish you had a boyfriend.

148
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,929
Maybe apredesses something about life on planet earth.

149
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,430
But you can not even get boyfriend.

150
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,482
Even with sweatshirts to say you love DICK

151
00:23:44,668 --> 00:23:48,568
so you know Philip K. Dick is the best
author of science fiction in the world.

152
00:23:48,568 --> 00:23:49,595
My God, you're really ignorant.

153
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:54,402
I just want to know how did you get a cell phone.

154
00:23:54,402 --> 00:23:55,687
I found it ok? found it!

155
00:23:56,522 --> 00:23:58,371
And why do calls if it is not yours?

156
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:01,094
It's hard not wanna talk about it.

157
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,760
Will be more complicated if not
explicares tudu me.

158
00:24:07,933 --> 00:24:08,982
Where you think you're?

159
00:24:09,911 --> 00:24:13,410
I do not talk to the phone in class
if that's what the director told you.

160
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,806
He says yes. Otherwise he would not have called me.

161
00:24:15,806 --> 00:24:18,106
Not true.
The phone does not even work.

162
00:24:19,116 --> 00:24:20,366
What

163
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:23,542
The phone this spoiled.
Never worked.

164
00:24:24,703 --> 00:24:26,403
If you do not want to work for that?

165
00:24:27,057 --> 00:24:28,406
This is even stranger.

166
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:32,800
You pretend that you use it just to piss you armares
and teachers?

167
00:24:33,176 --> 00:24:34,016
Is this?

168
00:24:34,016 --> 00:24:35,016
No.

169
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,057
So why do you do it?

170
00:24:36,742 --> 00:24:38,892
The director was very clear on the matter.

171
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:42,420
Want to tell me they are lying?

172
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:42,702
- I just hear.
- You hear What?

173
00:24:43,337 --> 00:24:44,656
The phone

174
00:24:47,453 --> 00:24:49,053
Do not say you did not work?

175
00:24:49,585 --> 00:24:52,384
Yes, but sometimes shot it from the bag and put it in the ear.

176
00:24:52,384 --> 00:24:53,464
For what?

177
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:55,276
I hear things.

178
00:24:56,754 --> 00:24:57,834
Oh, God.

179
00:24:58,209 --> 00:24:59,529
What things?

180
00:24:59,529 --> 00:24:59,992
Words.

181
00:25:00,787 --> 00:25:01,937
Words ? radio play, is it?

182
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:04,222
Not have said it does not work.

183
00:25:05,244 --> 00:25:06,843
So how do you hear words?

184
00:25:07,345 --> 00:25:09,195
Actually, it's only one word per day.

185
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,390
Not understand.

186
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,494
I hear a single word
Each day a new word.

187
00:25:14,744 --> 00:25:16,694
Lucy, you're not making any sense.

188
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,881
I knew not entendias,
so do not say anything.

189
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,269
Okay!.

190
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,939
You find a phone that does not work.

191
00:25:24,939 --> 00:25:26,619
Not have a signal.

192
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:26,748
But says words.

193
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:28,943
Yes

194
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:30,797
What words are these?

195
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:32,518
Tips.

196
00:25:32,518 --> 00:25:33,368
Tips on What?

197
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,675

199
00:25:38,195 --> 00:25:39,744
You have to promise.
- Ok, I promise.

200
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:45,562
Each word is a hint of what
save me every day.

201
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:48,587
It's not funny.

202
00:25:49,229 --> 00:25:50,678
In these  joke, right?

203
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:51,974
Look like I'm kidding?

204
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:54,278
This is serious but do not want
to panic.

205
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:56,052
How do you want me to respond?

206
00:25:57,873 --> 00:25:59,322
Hear the rest and take it easy, okay?

207
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,112

208
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,731
Remembered the fire?

209
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:04,303
How euposso forget?

210
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:05,089
All started there.

211
00:26:06,571 --> 00:26:07,891
As well?

212
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,299
This morning I found the phone but did not work.

213
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:13,950
I tried to find out the reason
once seemed new.

214
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,700
I tried on and off and check the signal.

215
00:26:18,005 --> 00:26:19,455
Suddenly I heard a word.

216
00:26:20,521 --> 00:26:22,080
What word?

217
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,668
Window

218
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:24,489
I only heard the word window

219
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:28,391
I came home and went straight to the kitchen window
without knowing why.

220
00:26:29,174 --> 00:26:30,254
And I opened it.

221
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:35,010
You know what happened next.

222
00:26:35,564 --> 00:26:38,863
You opened the window that saved our lives
because the phone told you?

223
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:41,457
I know that appears crazy.

224
00:26:42,175 --> 00:26:44,125
I want to pair with it immediately.

225
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:46,156
Non Yesterday was the word "ticket".

226
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,000
And then?

227
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,840
Did you see the news?

228
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,439
Hear a gang shootout in concert
and two kids died.

229
00:26:53,295 --> 00:26:55,694
I was supposed to have gone but did not.
Do you know why?

230
00:26:55,694 --> 00:26:56,740
No, why?

231
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,443
I lost my ticket.

232
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,566
Glad you lost the ticket.

233
00:27:00,691 --> 00:27:03,939
But how do you expect me to believe
hear these words or tips?

234
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:07,843
You know I never believed in witchcraft or suprestições
.

235
00:27:08,456 --> 00:27:09,755
've Always been very rational.

236
00:27:10,357 --> 00:27:12,456
So believe what I'm saying.

237
00:27:13,784 --> 00:27:15,134
Tell me one more thing...

238
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:17,516
What?

239
00:27:18,027 --> 00:27:19,276
What's the word today?

240
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:20,681
Have saved your life?

241
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:25,825
I know what the word is
but still nothing happened.

242
00:27:25,825 --> 00:27:26,706
So what?

243
00:27:26,706 --> 00:27:29,305
And why would I tell you if
not believe me?

244
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:31,427
Like you want me to believe,
if not you tell me?

245
00:27:33,175 --> 00:27:33,974
I have an idea.

246
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,703
I will write the word
and so will not know until it happened.

247
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:42,902
So no sneaky paranoid.

248
00:27:43,856 --> 00:27:45,415
Paranoia, I?

249
00:27:45,983 --> 00:27:47,133
I have a better idea.

250
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,383
What?

251
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:49,956
Can I see your phone?

252
00:27:50,996 --> 00:27:52,076
Why?

253
00:27:52,307 --> 00:27:53,806
I just want to see you for a second.

254
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:01,127
What is the idea?

255
00:28:01,127 --> 00:28:02,582
I'll show you.

256
00:28:15,106 --> 00:28:16,906
What are you doing?

257
00:28:16,906 --> 00:28:17,919
I'm sorry but I have to put a stop to it.

258
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:23,323
If you need tips, listen to me
instead of a spoiled phone.

259
00:28:28,178 --> 00:28:28,897
Lucy!.

260
00:28:31,639 --> 00:28:32,639
Not!

261
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:35,289
Hang in there.

262
00:28:35,727 --> 00:28:37,027
Do not let go of me, please.

263
00:28:37,027 --> 00:28:37,976
Grab my hand.

264
00:28:38,863 --> 00:28:39,813
I'm holding you.

265
00:28:43,143 --> 00:28:44,392
Do not let go, do not let go.

266
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:47,973
Help me, mother.

267
00:28:56,853 --> 00:28:58,153
Grab tightly, darling.

268
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:00,103

269
00:29:00,103 --> 00:29:01,902
Mother holds me.

270
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:03,582
Look at me.

271
00:29:03,582 --> 00:29:04,732
I do not get off, baby.

272
00:29:04,732 --> 00:29:06,531
Do not let go of me.

273
00:29:12,987 --> 00:29:15,137
This phone will kill you
and not save you.

274
00:29:20,244 --> 00:29:21,803
Think again.

275
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:24,888
Hand

276
00:29:42,043 --> 00:29:43,343
Mother, do you think this a good idea?

277
00:29:44,059 --> 00:29:46,958
I do not see how
flee the city makes any difference.

278
00:29:47,393 --> 00:29:50,192
Promised thy Director to
would spend a few days with you.

279
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:51,084
Only the two of us and nobody else.

280
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,191
But always just us two wherever.

281
00:29:56,103 --> 00:29:59,552
Need to realize what is really wrong with you
and this phone.

282
00:29:59,552 --> 00:30:00,318
Can not think of home.

283
00:30:01,069 --> 00:30:05,118
And if you're tired of being just the two because
do not you bring your imaginary boyfriend?

284
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,569
Maybe I can not get a boyfriend because you did not
. Must be genetic.

285
00:30:20,257 --> 00:30:21,207
After all, where are we going?

286
00:30:22,377 --> 00:30:23,816
I do not know.

287
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:25,398
Since than to Mexico.

288
00:30:25,398 --> 00:30:28,097
For God's sake, lucy,
we are not evading police.

289
00:30:28,097 --> 00:30:30,804
Do you think that only criminals is that
want to go to mexico?

290
00:30:30,804 --> 00:30:31,009
Calm. Let me think.

291
00:30:32,653 --> 00:30:33,552
Look, it's simple...

292
00:30:33,552 --> 00:30:35,902
Can not come to West
because that's where we are.

293
00:30:36,962 --> 00:30:39,462
We can not go south because
are not marginal.

294
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:43,463
North  E, forget it. If you do not arrange man in los Angeles, much less in San Francisco.

295
00:30:43,463 --> 00:30:44,554
Are left with one opçõa.

296
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:46,547
What is it?

297
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,206
Las Vegas.

298
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:50,857
Wanted.

299
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:00,119
There Tell me how often the
hear these words?

300
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,356
Daily. I told you.

301
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,220
E is just a word a day right?

302
00:31:04,505 --> 00:31:05,505
Yes

303
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:09,242
So if each word lasts 24 hours, after midnight you should hear another.

304
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,400
Reckon so.

305
00:31:12,726 --> 00:31:13,625
Can not wait.

306
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:16,034
You know where we are going?

307
00:31:16,034 --> 00:31:17,233
Yet.

308
00:31:18,575 --> 00:31:21,325
Do not know
also liked to travel into the unknown.

309
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,660
What are you doing?

310
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,193
Also I'm traveling.

311
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:30,676
What's the book?

312
00:31:30,676 --> 00:31:32,359
"The Time Machine" by H. G. Wells.

313
00:31:32,782 --> 00:31:33,932
Not have made the movie?

314
00:31:34,277 --> 00:31:35,118
Miscellaneous.

315
00:31:35,118 --> 00:31:36,817
For  you want then read the book?

316
00:31:38,662 --> 00:31:40,562
I'm actually reading it for the 3rd time.

317
00:31:40,562 --> 00:31:41,562
Are you crazy? why?

318
00:31:42,099 --> 00:31:44,798
Because I'm doing a thesis on "Time Machine".

319
00:31:45,248 --> 00:31:47,047
See is time travel like that.

320
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:50,144
Because you do not see the
trilogy "Back to the Future"?

321
00:31:50,144 --> 00:31:52,193
Instead of the same book you read three times.

322
00:31:53,264 --> 00:31:55,063
Actually, only read the book once.

323
00:31:55,063 --> 00:31:59,412
Because I've traveled back in time
two times and I went to the moment before having read it.

324
00:31:59,412 --> 00:32:02,103
So I do not remember. therefore.
Is as if you were reading the 1st time.

325
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:04,348
What?

326
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:09,680
You need to relax.
I'm messing about you.

327
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:46,196

00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:48,091

00:32:58,494 --> 00:32:59,454
Welcome.

332
00:33:02,757 --> 00:33:04,157
Finally 'll be able to sleep.

333
00:33:05,403 --> 00:33:07,202
You can not nothing.

334
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:11,031
Do you think you'll be able to sleep without knowing
the next word that will save my daughter?

335
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:13,630
I said I only hear one word per day.

336
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:15,223
I know, but we are already the next day.

337
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,150
Will pass midnight,
if you have not noticed.

338
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:19,150
Are you serious?

339
00:33:19,744 --> 00:33:22,643
Of course I am. You better take the phone and hearken
.

340
00:33:22,643 --> 00:33:24,558
We will not sleep while not hearing the word of God.

341
00:33:24,558 --> 00:33:29,407
But it did not and so. I can not force the phone to tell me words each time aptece me.

342
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,715
Happens when
has to happen, not when I want.

343
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:33,349
Can you at least try, please?

344
00:33:34,242 --> 00:33:35,191
Mom, I'm tired.

345
00:33:35,736 --> 00:33:37,086
Try there, for God's sake.

346
00:33:39,407 --> 00:33:43,007
I have done this alone and do not know if
result you especada looking.

347
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:44,256
Do you want covering your eyes?

348
00:33:50,892 --> 00:33:52,292
I think I can hear something.

349
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:53,051
What? What do you hear?

350
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:56,313
I hear...

351
00:33:58,948 --> 00:33:59,908
"Sleep"

352
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,910
Do not be a smart.

353
00:34:02,581 --> 00:34:03,731
Brace yourself, okay?

354
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:08,633
I hear nothing.

355
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,415
Can we do this tomorrow?

356
00:34:13,499 --> 00:34:14,339
Expected.

357
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:18,258

358
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:19,947

What?

362
00:34:26,887 --> 00:34:27,886
"King" and the word King

363
00:34:28,746 --> 00:34:30,145
What does that mean?

364
00:34:30,635 --> 00:34:32,534
I mean that. "King" is the hint.

365
00:34:32,534 --> 00:34:33,719
King of what?

366
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:36,580
I do not know. But it will save my life
this is guaranteed.

367
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,869
What King?

368
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:40,568
Perhaps the king kong.
I heard that girls love.

369
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:43,619
Do not think joke.

370
00:34:45,653 --> 00:34:46,703
We can sleep now?

371
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:50,514
Nothing will happen now
but worth thinking about tomorrow.

372
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:53,421
Expected.

373
00:34:54,354 --> 00:34:55,314
What?

374
00:34:55,935 --> 00:34:57,335
You can not sleep in this bed.

375
00:34:57,819 --> 00:34:59,139
Why not?

376
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,135
Is not safe.

377
00:35:00,135 --> 00:35:00,855
What?

378
00:35:01,477 --> 00:35:02,826
Jump out of bed and come with me.

379
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,559
Are you kidding?

380
00:35:09,795 --> 00:35:10,644
Mom, are you crazy?

381
00:35:18,291 --> 00:35:19,491
Please.

382
00:35:19,491 --> 00:35:21,024
What are you doing?

383
00:35:21,024 --> 00:35:22,104
Sorry.

384
00:35:23,443 --> 00:35:25,142
We need a King size bed

385
00:35:25,142 --> 00:35:27,030
I think I have no tonight.

386
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,526
Can check? It is very important.

387
00:35:33,734 --> 00:35:35,683
There is a room but is unable.

388
00:35:36,348 --> 00:35:37,348
Fits perfectly.

389
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:41,264
The toilet is clogged.
- Do not care.

390
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:48,638
Farewell.

391
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:56,444
If "King" you will save, you will sleep on one.

392
00:36:00,277 --> 00:36:01,357
Here

393
00:36:01,715 --> 00:36:03,014
We can not take risks.

394
00:36:05,236 --> 00:36:07,236
Was here the King Kong and evidence left.

395
00:36:07,236 --> 00:36:09,484
If you need to pee,
uses the tub.

396
00:36:14,347 --> 00:36:15,797
Rise and shine, my Queen.

397
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:21,043
Hurry up you have to find a King

398
00:36:23,217 --> 00:36:24,897
time?

399
00:36:25,686 --> 00:36:27,367
How do I look?

400
00:36:27,807 --> 00:36:29,257
You do remember my mother.

401
00:36:29,804 --> 00:36:31,054
I take that as a compliment.

402
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:33,881
Some think we have a sexy mom.

403
00:36:35,372 --> 00:36:37,622
I know that the kids of the neighborhood
call you.

404
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:39,908
Bofo Ma.

405
00:36:41,172 --> 00:36:42,131
Bofo Ma?

406
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:42,931
What the hell is this?

407
00:36:43,685 --> 00:36:44,584
Good Mother to fu...

408
00:36:45,302 --> 00:36:46,741
Dress...

409
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:49,420
My God, lucy. this is horrible.

410
00:36:49,964 --> 00:36:53,213
Mother, you're too antinadinha.
So never get yourself a boyfriend.

411
00:36:53,558 --> 00:36:54,658
And you really need a

412
00:37:01,074 --> 00:37:04,274
And you is better you train this laughter,
it look like a choked dog.

413
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:08,483
Where  we have breakfast?

414
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:10,928
Burger King where else?

415
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:18,096
Here you go.

416
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,427
Just found this.

417
00:37:20,147 --> 00:37:22,246
There is no Burger King
a radius of 20km.

418
00:37:23,766 --> 00:37:26,465
Still think you should eat
one. Just in case.

419
00:37:26,465 --> 00:37:28,084
And how do you think would save me a hamburger?

420
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:30,003
There is no question a King

421
00:37:33,529 --> 00:37:34,579
I bought this for you.

422
00:37:35,865 --> 00:37:37,364
"The shining" Stephen King

423
00:37:37,791 --> 00:37:38,750
Really?

424
00:37:39,093 --> 00:37:41,241
Do not let go. at least until midnight.

425
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:45,008
And I thought that is what I was going crazy
.

426
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,599
You know that Stephen King writes
heaps of horror stories.

427
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,102
And usually the pricipal character has a sad ending.

428
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:54,073
This history, for example, is a bath of blood
pricipio end.

429
00:37:55,629 --> 00:37:58,378
I remember from the movie
EJA'm nervous enough.

430
00:38:00,176 --> 00:38:00,975
Change the subject.

431
00:38:03,507 --> 00:38:05,707
Never know what you had offered me a book
.

432
00:38:06,191 --> 00:38:06,991
Of course I gave.

433
00:38:06,991 --> 00:38:08,141
No, this is the first.

434
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:11,798
've Offered you a daily.

435
00:38:12,192 --> 00:38:13,392
This is not quite a book.

436
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,446
Is, type it after him.

437
00:38:22,025 --> 00:38:23,374
I'm going to the house to the bathroom.

438
00:38:27,594 --> 00:38:28,434
Expected.

439
00:38:28,434 --> 00:38:29,312
Stephen takes you.

440
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,580
Still think we'll use it for something else
.

441
00:38:34,926 --> 00:38:35,646
Take it

442
00:38:38,826 --> 00:38:40,126
Do not use all the pages.

443
00:38:40,778 --> 00:38:41,978
Guard some for me.

444
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:08,890
O clown! Where is cocoa you owe me?

445
00:39:09,352 --> 00:39:10,402
I said I gave you.

446
00:39:10,402 --> 00:39:12,104
You said the same yesterday.
I want the money now.

447
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:14,246
I do not have it here I'll give you tomorrow.

448
00:39:14,706 --> 00:39:17,105
You have until midnight or never
more you play chess.

449
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,150
Where you think you're
backpack with my daughter?

450
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:28,789
Let me go crazy Gaja.

451
00:39:29,217 --> 00:39:31,017
Not off anything.

452
00:39:31,017 --> 00:39:31,816
Take're hands off me.

453
00:39:31,816 --> 00:39:32,765
Give me that. Thief.

454
00:39:33,515 --> 00:39:34,465
Off me already said.

455
00:39:34,713 --> 00:39:35,513
Give me the bag!

456
00:39:36,258 --> 00:39:37,058
Give me the bag.

457
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,808
Cow! Get off me!

458
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:43,739
Is this what you want?

459
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,099
Mother!

460
00:39:56,913 --> 00:39:57,812
're Gonna die, bitch!

461
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:23,506
Disappears.

462
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,489
Run to the car, Lucy.

463
00:40:33,243 --> 00:40:34,563
Corre Lucy.

464
00:40:45,365 --> 00:40:47,664
Shoot
a book against a guy with a gun.

465
00:40:47,664 --> 00:40:49,210
Gone mad?

466
00:40:49,777 --> 00:40:52,426
He'd shoot you.
What I supposed to do?

467
00:40:52,426 --> 00:40:53,717
Do not you put the taua
life at risk for my sake.

468
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,667
I know how to defend myself.

469
00:40:56,411 --> 00:40:57,811
Damn Stephen King.

470
00:40:57,811 --> 00:41:00,293
Instead of protecting you, this phone is
will kill you.

471
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,238
What is this?

472
00:41:04,967 --> 00:41:05,767
My protector.

473
00:41:10,625 --> 00:41:11,705
My God .

474
00:41:18,813 --> 00:41:20,312
This is not the mimhas things.

475
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:21,562
WHAT?

476
00:41:21,905 --> 00:41:23,255
This backpack is not mine.

477
00:41:24,123 --> 00:41:25,273
Where did you get this?

478
00:41:25,273 --> 00:41:27,061
I thought the thief had your bag.

479
00:41:27,061 --> 00:41:28,860
I put mine under the seat. Did you see?

480
00:41:29,651 --> 00:41:31,251
I thought he had taken it.

481
00:41:31,914 --> 00:41:32,764
Apparently not.

482
00:41:33,268 --> 00:41:33,988
Damn.

483
00:41:35,154 --> 00:41:36,503
We have to go back.

484
00:41:36,503 --> 00:41:37,527
No way.

485
00:41:38,315 --> 00:41:39,916
I have all my stuff there.

486
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,256
Forget. I'll buy you other books.

487
00:41:41,256 --> 00:41:42,652
My thesis were months of work.

488
00:41:43,278 --> 00:41:45,928
If you can go back in time,
're comfortable.

489
00:41:46,419 --> 00:41:48,768
Sorry, but another way not voltamosatrás.

490
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:51,918
What now do this stuff?

491
00:41:52,516 --> 00:41:53,416
Do not touch anything.

492
00:41:54,133 --> 00:41:57,032
Better not leave our fingerprints on it
.

493
00:41:57,032 --> 00:41:58,181
Throw it out the window.

494
00:41:59,340 --> 00:41:59,841


495
00:42:58,232 --> 00:42:59,381
These are the conditions:

496
00:42:59,595 --> 00:43:03,745
Tonight I want a bed to myself and not tell you the "word" before dawn.

497
00:43:03,745 --> 00:43:04,623
You forget one thing.

498
00:43:04,984 --> 00:43:05,703
What?

499
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:07,533
The day is not over yet.

500
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
It is better grabbing you to your protetctor.

501
00:43:10,877 --> 00:43:11,728
Hold the steering wheel.

502
00:43:21,046 --> 00:43:22,006
There you go.

503
00:43:22,621 --> 00:43:24,061
Not the tires.

504
00:43:24,586 --> 00:43:26,536
I'm done.
You just hang the King

505
00:43:38,627 --> 00:43:41,777
Do you think if I hear the phone,
also listened to the words?

506
00:43:43,257 --> 00:43:44,217
I do not know.

507
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:46,123
Why not try?

508
00:43:47,542 --> 00:43:49,101
How is the voice?

509
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:49,984
What voice?

510
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:51,325
The voice you hear.

511
00:43:52,708 --> 00:43:53,757
Is a man or woman?

512
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:56,330
Who said I hear voices?

513
00:43:57,602 --> 00:43:59,051
So as you hear the words?

514
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:03,357
Appear in my head.
I do not know how.

515
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:04,407
This is an aberration.

516
00:44:06,397 --> 00:44:07,117
Balls .

517
00:44:07,117 --> 00:44:08,561
What is it?

518
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:09,705
Hurts my head.

519
00:44:10,513 --> 00:44:11,713
Hurts so much?

520
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:13,070
Yes hurts

521
00:44:14,316 --> 00:44:16,765
We stopped at a pharmacy and buy some pills.

522
00:44:16,765 --> 00:44:17,302
Ray phone.

523
00:44:18,288 --> 00:44:19,088
's Radiation.

524
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,880
Yet conzinha the brain and becomes a mutant.

525
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,144
Mother ..

526
00:44:26,525 --> 00:44:28,204
Something is happening.

527
00:44:28,204 --> 00:44:28,603
What?

528
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,189
I have a new word.

529
00:44:32,189 --> 00:44:32,852
What?

530
00:44:33,226 --> 00:44:34,875
I just heard a new word.

531
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:36,579
How so? Is that I'm holding the phone
.

532
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:37,966
I know. I do not understand.

533
00:44:39,398 --> 00:44:40,947
It is not just a word a day?

534
00:44:41,565 --> 00:44:43,714
I do not make the rules. Tabém'm confused.

535
00:44:44,602 --> 00:44:46,351
But I have another word, I have!

536
00:44:47,676 --> 00:44:48,776
For God's sake Lucy.

537
00:44:48,997 --> 00:44:50,547
When is this going to end?

538
00:44:51,698 --> 00:44:53,047
You're kidding, right?

539
00:44:53,598 --> 00:44:55,398
No, I'm not.

540
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:56,195
So what the hell is the new word?

541
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,965
Ar

542
00:44:58,818 --> 00:44:59,569
?

543
00:44:59,569 --> 00:45:00,285
Yes

544
00:45:00,285 --> 00:45:01,456
Like "Wind"

545
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:02,456
Yes

546
00:45:03,018 --> 00:45:03,977
Here you go.

547
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:06,680
Takes lots of it.

548
00:45:07,827 --> 00:45:09,376
How's the headache now?

549
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:27,743
What are you doing?

550
00:45:28,846 --> 00:45:29,946
Leave the window open.

551
00:45:29,946 --> 00:45:31,012
I'm getting cold.

552
00:45:31,827 --> 00:45:33,326
You can also close the other?

553
00:45:33,326 --> 00:45:34,648
Not think it's prudent.

554
00:45:39,305 --> 00:45:41,705
I better never tell you
word.

555
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:42,478
Why?

556
00:45:43,337 --> 00:45:47,186
Because probably this evening
gonna make me sleep in a bouncy bed.

557
00:45:47,186 --> 00:45:48,978
Started by
say that this happened because I'm paranoid.

558
00:45:49,357 --> 00:45:51,206
But now you're acting much worse.

559
00:45:51,206 --> 00:45:52,709
Not learned anything with the "King"?

560
00:45:53,687 --> 00:45:56,336
If the "air" will save me,
will be of an unexpected way.

561
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,930
So do not try to help because they only do worse.

562
00:45:59,244 --> 00:46:00,193
Stops but the car.

563
00:46:00,731 --> 00:46:01,930
Ok, I close the windows.

564
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:02,650
Stop the car.

565
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:03,139
Do not need to bother you.

566
00:46:04,107 --> 00:46:05,187
Why?

567
00:46:05,187 --> 00:46:06,383
Stops or vomit in your lap.

568
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:14,218
Lucy!

569
00:46:24,450 --> 00:46:25,889
Come on, Lucy.

570
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,210
Lucy,

571
00:46:34,724 --> 00:46:36,044

572
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:07,000
Reached your destination.

573
00:47:11,331 --> 00:47:12,431
Reached your destination.

574
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,540
Damn.

575
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:13,187
My God.

576
00:48:24,126 --> 00:48:25,375
Lucy.

577
00:48:39,099 --> 00:48:40,778
PREVIOUS DAY

578
00:49:54,922 --> 00:49:55,762
Claire.

579
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,382
Claire.

580
00:50:10,612 --> 00:50:12,052
Hello, Claire.

581
00:50:12,284 --> 00:50:13,334
Now with this site?

582
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:14,956
Yes

583
00:50:15,527 --> 00:50:16,976
Account there that goes mana?

584
00:50:16,976 --> 00:50:19,957
Alloys Not me two years ago and suddenly
leave me a message

585
00:50:20,858 --> 00:50:23,158
To come against thee
near the end of the world.

586
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:26,532
This is a psychological test?

587
00:50:26,532 --> 00:50:28,239
Matt, you may seem weird, but...

588
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,239
I need your help with a
of my patients.

589
00:50:31,722 --> 00:50:33,471
One of your patients need me?

590
00:50:33,884 --> 00:50:34,834
This is very serious.

591
00:50:35,452 --> 00:50:37,902
I think you might be the only salvation from this patient.

592
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:39,336
You are a psychiatrist who is not me.

593
00:50:40,683 --> 00:50:41,733
Can you hear me?

594
00:50:43,526 --> 00:50:44,326
I'm all ears.

595
00:50:44,758 --> 00:50:46,908
I have in my charge a very special patient.

596
00:50:46,908 --> 00:50:48,641
Name is Daniel Doyle and has 17 years.

597
00:50:50,134 --> 00:50:52,483
Are hospitalized a year ago in
Psychiatric Center.

598
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:54,301
Still work in this madhouse?

599
00:50:54,783 --> 00:50:57,532
Yeah I was promoted to vice president last week.

600
00:50:58,401 --> 00:51:00,080
Congratulations V.P.

601
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:02,157
Only lasted one day.

602
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:05,135
What happened?

603
00:51:05,135 --> 00:51:06,185
Divergent opinions.

604
00:51:06,947 --> 00:51:09,996
For example wanted to discharge the
Daniel against my opinion.

605
00:51:12,377 --> 00:51:13,477
And what is your opnion?

606
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:16,404
I think he will not last anything outside.

607
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,059
What do you mean?

608
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:20,222
Suicide.

609
00:51:20,748 --> 00:51:22,427
I see...

610
00:51:22,427 --> 00:51:22,932
And you want me to do?

611
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:26,859
Daniel's girlfriend died
and he can not overcome it.

612
00:51:26,859 --> 00:51:29,828
I think he needs to talk to someone
believing that understands.

613
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,780
Someone he can respect.

614
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:33,426
And you think I am?

615
00:51:33,709 --> 00:51:34,789
Yes I think.

616
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:37,077
Talk to him. please?

617
00:51:37,517 --> 00:51:39,317
Claire, my girlfriend did not die.

618
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:39,875
I know.

619
00:51:40,475 --> 00:51:41,574
But you almost died.

620
00:51:42,937 --> 00:51:45,235
Is such a nice kid.
It reminds me of you.

621
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:46,187
Really?

622
00:51:48,782 --> 00:51:51,082
And you can explain to me why
made me come here?

623
00:51:51,918 --> 00:51:52,767
You will get there.

624
00:51:53,647 --> 00:51:55,297
Now listen to me very carefully.

625
00:51:55,297 --> 00:51:56,857
Ok, continues!

626
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,616
There are things a year, during the holidays

627
00:52:01,212 --> 00:52:04,562
The  Daniel went camping lake
Mirage with his girlfriend, Jennifer.

628
00:52:04,562 --> 00:52:06,447
She was in the water while Daniel took pictures

629
00:52:07,634 --> 00:52:09,883
All went well until Jennifer felt bad

630
00:52:11,677 --> 00:52:12,877
disappeared in istante.

631
00:52:13,236 --> 00:52:16,035
But Daniel
reacted quickly launched into the water and grabbed a

632
00:52:16,806 --> 00:52:19,355
Touxe it to land and provided first aid.

633
00:52:20,396 --> 00:52:22,196
But unfortunately she did not survive.

634
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:25,370
Here begins the problem of Daniel.

635
00:52:25,370 --> 00:52:28,867
He says not stand
loses it and decided to end his life too.

636
00:52:30,768 --> 00:52:34,217
A week after her funeral
he jumped into the lake and... guess what?

637
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:35,196
Reckon not died.

638
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,336
Okay. But more is that exptraordinário

639
00:52:38,925 --> 00:52:42,025
and awakened again when I was trying to save his girlfriend.

640
00:52:44,574 --> 00:52:45,874
I'm a bit confused.

641
00:52:45,874 --> 00:52:50,822
What I said was, he jumped into the lake, drowned drowned and woke up trying to save Jennifer.

642
00:52:50,822 --> 00:52:52,322
But Jennifer is not dead?

643
00:52:53,002 --> 00:52:55,601
You. But it will not be if you travel back in time.

644
00:52:57,180 --> 00:52:58,380
Let me see if I understand.

645
00:52:59,066 --> 00:53:03,665
During drowning, he travels back in time. and wakes up when the accident happened on the lake.

646
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:05,968
Exactly. At the time she was drowning.

647
00:53:06,482 --> 00:53:07,582
What happens next?

648
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:09,342
He tries to save her but can not.

649
00:53:10,738 --> 00:53:15,086
So try to return back repeatedly in the hope of one day getting saved it.

650
00:53:15,086 --> 00:53:16,835
It's an endless circle of time.

651
00:53:18,431 --> 00:53:20,380
Correct.
There is another interesting thing.

652
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:21,270
Really? What will?

653
00:53:22,721 --> 00:53:25,720
Go up to the top of the first aircraft
and call me when you're there.

654
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:37,870
Looking for a small cover behind the right wing.

655
00:53:43,211 --> 00:53:44,011
Can you see it?

656
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:45,528
Yes I think so.

657
00:53:46,085 --> 00:53:47,684
Open it and tell me what you find.

658
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:57,089
A digital camera.

659
00:53:58,007 --> 00:53:59,447
And a key.

660
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:00,761
You see the camera?
- Yes

661
00:54:01,674 --> 00:54:05,323
Daniel says he can only travel in time if
take this camera with him.

662
00:54:07,226 --> 00:54:08,026
Explains it there?

663
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,399
Take a picture of yourself before
die and that is what makes time travel.

664
00:54:13,944 --> 00:54:15,744
The kid has an incredible imagination.

665
00:54:15,744 --> 00:54:16,826
You bet.

666
00:54:17,783 --> 00:54:19,883
How he was pararaos your care?

667
00:54:19,883 --> 00:54:22,642
Was caught trying to drown
but managed to stop it.

668
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:27,241
Troxeram him to the psychiatric center and
Directorate agreed to admit him.

669
00:54:28,445 --> 00:54:31,145
Same Direction
now think ECE is now cured.

670
00:54:31,145 --> 00:54:31,795
Correct.

671
00:54:33,124 --> 00:54:34,724
There is one thing I do not understand.

672
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:41,020
Made me come here just to get the camera
the kid or is there something more behind this hostória?

673
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:43,467
're Scaring me seriously.
What is really happening?

674
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,599
I stumbled across a big problem.

675
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:48,063
Do not tell me!

676
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,013
Let me guess.

677
00:54:51,475 --> 00:54:52,975
Your opinion was even stronger.

678
00:54:53,215 --> 00:54:54,765
I think it's family problem.

679
00:54:55,634 --> 00:54:57,584
Spit, claire.
What did you do?

680
00:54:59,225 --> 00:55:01,575
Before giving high to Daniel,
I took it from there.

681
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:04,289
Do not tell me that the kidnapped boy?

682
00:55:05,042 --> 00:55:06,641
I had to do something.

683
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:08,559
Where is he?

684
00:55:10,071 --> 00:55:11,520
Can you see the atrázs tickets?

685
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:12,486
Yes

686
00:55:13,077 --> 00:55:14,027
He is in there.

687
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:16,664
The boy is on the plane?
And where the hell are you?

688
00:55:17,538 --> 00:55:21,487
I was with him but the police caught me
and now I'm under house arrest.

689
00:55:21,487 --> 00:55:22,806
Endoideste?

690
00:55:23,228 --> 00:55:27,027
What I supposed to do?
Once he has a chance, will try to drown.

691
00:55:28,264 --> 00:55:29,813
Conscience of what you did?

692
00:55:29,813 --> 00:55:31,678
You will not be able to exercise more. And you're stuck.

693
00:55:32,485 --> 00:55:34,384
No matter, since save Daniel.

694
00:55:35,784 --> 00:55:37,484
Matt, please, he is alone.

695
00:55:40,456 --> 00:55:43,355
I can not get involved in this
got problems arriving.

696
00:55:43,355 --> 00:55:44,503
I only ask you to talk to him

697
00:55:45,014 --> 00:55:46,564
Claire Sorry, but I can not.

698
00:55:46,947 --> 00:55:49,397
Have you forgotten that you were in the same situation?

699
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:54,108
Quse I lost my own brother because
was also just worried about me.

700
00:55:56,931 --> 00:55:59,680
OS signals were more than evident
but I did not know.

701
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:02,771
And I am very sorry.

702
00:56:03,132 --> 00:56:07,531
So now if there's anything I can do to help
someone in the same situation...

703
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:11,549
... I will not hesitate.

704
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:13,537
How long did you take the camera to the kid?

705
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:14,855
Since lodged Center.

706
00:56:22,119 --> 00:56:22,870
Okay

707
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:26,538
If the kid thinks this camera is
a time machine.

708
00:56:27,141 --> 00:56:28,591
I want to know how it works.

709
00:56:55,938 --> 00:56:56,888
You are here, Daniel?

710
00:57:30,737 --> 00:57:31,576
Daniel?

711
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:40,560

712
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:20,735
Daniel?

713
00:58:24,825 --> 00:58:26,145

Welcome to flying aimlessly, matt.

717
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:40,376
I never liked flying.

718
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:44,394
I like to have both feet on the ground.

719
00:58:44,394 --> 00:58:46,194
Do not tell me...

720
00:58:46,563 --> 00:58:47,613

Although Claire
I think I can help.

723
00:58:57,340 --> 00:58:58,190
God knows why.

724
00:59:00,295 --> 00:59:01,395
Once  helped a dog.

725
00:59:03,746 --> 00:59:05,296
But I am also a veterinarian.

726
00:59:06,088 --> 00:59:07,637
Actually, I'm unemployed.

727
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:12,160
Let's say I'm an asshole.

728
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:13,410
Type, like you, no offense.

729
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:18,469
You know she just wants to help you. right?

730
00:59:18,469 --> 00:59:19,353
No result.

731
00:59:20,229 --> 00:59:21,079
From to realize.

732
00:59:25,886 --> 00:59:27,935
I understand your angst toward life.

733
00:59:30,609 --> 00:59:32,759
It is painful to lose a girlfriend that way.

734
00:59:34,412 --> 00:59:36,462
I know how it can get around the head.

735
00:59:36,721 --> 00:59:37,681
Really?

736
00:59:38,577 --> 00:59:40,026
Your girlfriend also died?

737
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:41,367
No.

738
00:59:42,534 --> 00:59:44,333
I hope not.

739
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:44,922
How so?

740
00:59:45,369 --> 00:59:46,169
She disappeared.

741
00:59:46,804 --> 00:59:48,004
Kidnapped or something?

742
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,120
He's gone.

743
00:59:50,526 --> 00:59:52,526
And here I thought
was the biggest asshole.

744
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,789
Good observation.

745
00:59:57,206 --> 00:59:58,055
I do not blame her.

746
01:00:00,761 --> 01:00:01,811
I was a silly kid.

747
01:00:03,131 --> 01:00:04,811
What happened?

748
01:00:09,136 --> 01:00:10,815
Had  16.

749
01:00:11,539 --> 01:00:12,339
He was a rich kid

750
01:00:13,202 --> 01:00:15,003
Raised in a wealthy family in Chicago.

751
01:00:16,669 --> 01:00:18,869
My parents had big plans for me.

752
01:00:22,508 --> 01:00:24,907
He was a prodigy student and planned to follow
medicine.

753
01:00:26,768 --> 01:00:27,568
All was well.

754
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:31,316
But fate decided to intervene.

755
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:35,208
Guess?

756
01:00:39,435 --> 01:00:41,115
I fell in love.

757
01:00:44,782 --> 01:00:45,831
The problem was that...

758
01:00:47,557 --> 01:00:49,156
She was 20 and was a taxi driver.

759
01:00:54,079 --> 01:00:57,177
I should have known better than to try to force my parents,

760
01:00:57,177 --> 01:00:58,509
to accept that I wanted to marry,

761
01:01:00,579 --> 01:01:02,579
with a taxi driver for 20 years, immigrant...

762
01:01:06,491 --> 01:01:08,140
Ecom diamond on a tattooed guy.

763
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:12,905
My God...

764
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,180
My parents Iançaram up
a war against us.

765
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:17,088
It was crazy.

766
01:01:17,826 --> 01:01:19,725
Yet
thought he could win.

767
01:01:20,019 --> 01:01:22,918
So, she and I decideimos
pretend we had finished...

768
01:01:24,420 --> 01:01:25,869
... Until I was of legal age.

769
01:01:29,203 --> 01:01:30,103
During two years.

770
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:37,211
It was really hard.

771
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,289
But we had a secret signal.

772
01:01:45,445 --> 01:01:47,645
Whenever we crossed we played in the nose.

773
01:01:50,438 --> 01:01:51,637
Is a very old gesture.

774
01:01:52,663 --> 01:01:54,013
Used by tribe Arctic.

775
01:01:54,612 --> 01:01:58,012
Whenever men left for
a long hunting trip in the Arctic.

776
01:01:59,759 --> 01:02:01,459
The women lo touched on the nose as well.

777
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:09,764
Means...

778
01:02:11,202 --> 01:02:13,701
My heart will follow you to the ends of
world.

779
01:02:17,628 --> 01:02:19,427
Thought it was an appropriate signal.

780
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:22,048
Because the environment around us was...

781
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:25,069
... Cold as a winter night in the Arctic.

782
01:02:28,800 --> 01:02:30,600
Apart sad thing is that not survived.

783
01:02:32,706 --> 01:02:34,456
It was not easy to fool my parents.

784
01:02:36,365 --> 01:02:39,914
Discovered she was not legalized in
and threatened with extradition.

785
01:02:43,811 --> 01:02:45,511
Great drama of adolescence, right?

786
01:02:48,365 --> 01:02:49,265
What happened to you?

787
01:02:51,748 --> 01:02:52,547
Never saw her again.

788
01:02:55,477 --> 01:02:57,156
And you did?

789
01:02:57,821 --> 01:02:59,271
I tried to go back in time.

790
01:03:01,053 --> 01:03:02,013
Like you.

791
01:03:03,733 --> 01:03:04,983
How?

792
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:11,995
Needless to say I could not.

793
01:03:17,114 --> 01:03:18,613
It seems to me you're stranded.

794
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:22,967
Life as a black comedy.

795
01:03:25,870 --> 01:03:28,419
At that time only thought of ending my life.

796
01:03:28,419 --> 01:03:30,918
And now I walk with a
injectable pen wallet.

797
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:34,320
Pen injection?

798
01:03:37,928 --> 01:03:39,077
Epinephrine injector.

799
01:03:42,316 --> 01:03:43,915
I'm allergic to bee stings.

800
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,139
Without this, a sting can be deadly.

801
01:03:46,941 --> 01:03:48,620
Pathetic, no?

802
01:03:51,121 --> 01:03:53,221
Tell me out, what has changed in your life since then

803
01:03:54,629 --> 01:03:57,228
What made you change the blade by
an injectable pen?

804
01:04:00,306 --> 01:04:01,506
Hope.

805
01:04:05,923 --> 01:04:09,422
Like you, I am hopeful
find like stepping back in time

806
01:04:09,422 --> 01:04:10,696
back to be with my girlfriend.

807
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,264
But I think to kill me
is not the solution.

808
01:04:14,580 --> 01:04:17,229
Unless you and your camera
prove me otherwise.

809
01:04:17,950 --> 01:04:19,301
What kind of precise proof?

810
01:04:19,914 --> 01:04:21,314
Could you bring me some pictures.

811
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:25,976
As they say,
"A picture is worth a thousand words".

812
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:29,140
If the camera
devolveres me and helping me out of here

813
01:04:30,831 --> 01:04:32,680
I bring you the photos you need.

814
01:04:34,826 --> 01:04:36,225
I'll see what I can do.

815
01:04:43,728 --> 01:04:45,378
Thanks for pass the night there.

816
01:04:45,378 --> 01:04:48,695
How could I refuse accommodation
Free as a theme park.

817
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:50,800
What do you think?

818
01:04:52,657 --> 01:04:55,757
I think those handcuffs
will hurt quite your resume.

819
01:04:56,198 --> 01:04:59,147
Sorry but desperate situations exirgem extreme actions.

820
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:03,392
We can not let go without
sure it will be fine.

821
01:05:03,392 --> 01:05:05,530
He will never be well unless we let go.

822
01:05:07,168 --> 01:05:09,467
You know, mom and dad have missed you.

823
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:12,006
You should try to forgive them.

824
01:05:12,006 --> 01:05:12,845
Maybe.

825
01:05:12,845 --> 01:05:15,494
It was a pen esters love you
the wrong girl.

826
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:16,762
It was not the wrong girl.

827
01:05:17,693 --> 01:05:20,142
Sorry, do not know what
said this in a bad way.

828
01:05:20,354 --> 01:05:22,004
My God, was about ten years ago.

829
01:05:22,565 --> 01:05:24,214
Ever you heard of it?

830
01:05:26,404 --> 01:05:27,404
No.

831
01:05:27,404 --> 01:05:29,653
I find it hard to believe you're still in love.

832
01:05:29,933 --> 01:05:30,983
But you are, are not you?

833
01:05:30,983 --> 01:05:33,782
I think it's a bit late for
a therapy session.

834
01:05:35,327 --> 01:05:37,177
Honestly, in part, I envy you.

835
01:05:37,982 --> 01:05:39,882
What they both need is to go to sleep.

836
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:41,438
I will make them possible.

837
01:05:42,407 --> 01:05:43,407
Good night - Good night

838
01:07:11,646 --> 01:07:13,445
Go West?

839
01:07:13,445 --> 01:07:15,099
Log  Young al.

840
01:07:15,099 --> 01:07:15,944
Thank you.

841
01:07:23,616 --> 01:07:25,516
Do not tell me you let him go?

842
01:07:25,516 --> 01:07:28,496
You said you wanted that Daniel
speak with someone who could respect

843
01:07:28,496 --> 01:07:30,548
Someone he believed that understood. right?

844
01:07:30,548 --> 01:07:31,069
Yes, said.

845
01:07:31,776 --> 01:07:35,076
The only way of really Daniel
trust me, it was freed.

846
01:07:36,046 --> 01:07:37,496
He is not ready.

847
01:07:37,496 --> 01:07:39,071
We know that he tried to commit suicide before.

848
01:07:40,242 --> 01:07:43,091
When we think of doing something so terrible ourselves...

849
01:07:43,091 --> 01:07:46,636
I felt so unhappy and alone that
never thought anyone could endure that.

850
01:07:46,636 --> 01:07:47,886
I know because I felt it.

851
01:07:47,886 --> 01:07:51,098
I felt so unhappy and alone that
never thought anyone could endure that.

852
01:07:52,466 --> 01:07:55,665
Daniel might still think about suicide.
But now it's different.

853
01:07:56,448 --> 01:07:59,846
He now knows that others
managed to overcome the same pain.

854
01:08:00,932 --> 01:08:02,431
He knows he's not alone.

855
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,230
And you know I'm here ready to help.

856
01:08:05,634 --> 01:08:07,333
I certainly hope you're right, Matt.

857
01:08:08,442 --> 01:08:09,842
I think that is where it goes.

858
01:08:09,842 --> 01:08:11,091
Where?

859
01:08:11,461 --> 01:08:15,660
He tried to drown himself in the lake Mirage
to wake up and save his girlfriend in the same location.

860
01:08:16,464 --> 01:08:19,363
I think that is where it goes and
is only 3 hours away.

861
01:08:19,363 --> 01:08:20,793
He will die, Matt.
I know I will.

862
01:08:20,793 --> 01:08:21,930
No. Do not worry.

863
01:08:22,486 --> 01:08:23,636
Let me handle this.

864
01:08:24,117 --> 01:08:25,916
Encontá it and I'll be alright.

865
01:09:02,874 --> 01:09:04,124
My sister is 65 years old.

866
01:09:04,935 --> 01:09:07,835
One day he comes home and hears a strange sound coming from
room.

867
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:12,380
She enters and runs into his daughter
40 years, my niece...

868
01:09:13,283 --> 01:09:14,733
... Playing with a vibrator.

869
01:09:17,201 --> 01:09:18,900
You know what a vibradoor, right?

870
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:19,929
Yes, I know.

871
01:09:21,194 --> 01:09:22,274
Internet.

872
01:09:22,704 --> 01:09:23,505
OK, I see.

873
01:09:24,875 --> 01:09:27,075
Then she told ihe:
What the hell are you doing?

874
01:09:27,974 --> 01:09:28,873
And the daughter said...

875
01:09:29,486 --> 01:09:30,686
Mom, I'm 40 years...

876
01:09:31,379 --> 01:09:32,830
... Look at me. 'm ugly...

877
01:09:33,245 --> 01:09:34,545
I'll never get married.

878
01:09:34,930 --> 01:09:36,529
This is the only husband who will.

879
01:09:37,351 --> 01:09:38,431
Is sad.

880
01:09:39,240 --> 01:09:40,079
Yeah.

881
01:09:41,106 --> 01:09:42,006
The next day...

882
01:09:42,587 --> 01:09:44,036
My brother comes home...

883
01:09:44,036 --> 01:09:46,436
And heard the same buzz coming from the
daughter's room...

884
01:09:47,214 --> 01:09:48,663
He walked in and there she was...

885
01:09:50,005 --> 01:09:51,055
... To use the vibrator.

886
01:09:52,716 --> 01:09:54,466
He said: What the hell is this?

887
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:57,869
And she replied:
Father, I have explained the mother...

888
01:09:58,318 --> 01:10:00,417
I'm 40, I'm ugly and I'll never marry.

889
01:10:01,687 --> 01:10:03,386
This is like my husband.

890
01:10:04,445 --> 01:10:06,593
ready, he turned his back in sadness.

891
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:10,408
The next day, my sister comes home...

892
01:10:11,367 --> 01:10:13,767
And finds him on the couch with a beer in one hand...

893
01:10:14,055 --> 01:10:15,454
And the vibrator on the other hand...

894
01:10:16,732 --> 01:10:17,731
Watching football on TV.

895
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,841
She Tell him:
What the hell is this?

896
01:10:21,424 --> 01:10:22,823
And he said: What is the problem?...

897
01:10:23,466 --> 01:10:26,065
I'm drinking beer and see
the game with my son.

898
01:10:30,543 --> 01:10:31,983
With son.

899
01:10:38,584 --> 01:10:39,684
Where you say you are?

900
01:10:39,684 --> 01:10:40,863
Not said.

901
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:42,413
So, where are you?

902
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,639
I was born in Iceland but grew up in California.

903
01:10:46,979 --> 01:10:49,778
I think the drastic climate change
affected my head.

904
01:10:50,334 --> 01:10:51,833
Well I ended up in an asylum.

905
01:10:51,833 --> 01:10:52,270
Really?

906
01:10:53,210 --> 01:10:54,009
When was this?

907
01:10:55,598 --> 01:10:56,548
Very recently.

908
01:10:58,682 --> 01:11:00,632
Is not cause for alarm. 'm harmless.

909
01:11:02,206 --> 01:11:04,005
You look well.

910
01:11:04,592 --> 01:11:05,551
You know...

911
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:08,800
I have had to put up with psychiatrists.

912
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,995
How so?

913
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,160
I used to faint...

914
01:11:13,553 --> 01:11:15,502
Every time he tried... you see?...

915
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,389
Me to lie down with my wife.

916
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:23,108
I could not do anything because
fainted before starting.

917
01:11:24,495 --> 01:11:25,795
You see my luck?

918
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,108
So...

919
01:11:27,753 --> 01:11:31,801
The doctors thought it was
head and sent me to a psychiatric hospital.

920
01:11:32,386 --> 01:11:34,985
Then they asked me a series of
Marados tests.

921
01:11:37,335 --> 01:11:40,085
Finally, they found that
'm just allergic to latex.

922
01:11:41,390 --> 01:11:43,239
See? I can not use rubber.

923
01:11:43,947 --> 01:11:45,346
You mean condoms?

924
01:11:45,796 --> 01:11:46,994
All kind of rubber.

925
01:11:47,259 --> 01:11:48,858
But pricipalmente condoms.

926
01:11:49,817 --> 01:11:52,016
The first anfinal diagnosis was right.

927
01:11:53,656 --> 01:11:55,306
I have a problem in the "head"

928
01:11:58,925 --> 01:12:00,025
this is really weird.

929
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:02,813
's Not all bad.

930
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,439
At least I won...

931
01:12:04,439 --> 01:12:05,878
... The best parking there.

932
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,638
Cool.

933
01:12:08,634 --> 01:12:09,714
Tell me...

934
01:12:10,474 --> 01:12:13,273
You should also have gone through
much there in the nuthouse.

935
01:12:15,558 --> 01:12:18,258
Like any good drama,
there is always comical moments.

936
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:20,668
This account there.

937
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:26,099
On one occasion, we had the visit of a rich lady who contributed
with large donations.

938
01:12:26,365 --> 01:12:28,765
Senhoara was a class with
and very conservative.

939
01:12:29,448 --> 01:12:31,498
Visista During a guided tour of the hospital...

940
01:12:31,943 --> 01:12:35,143
She went straight to the room where
a patient was masturbating.

941
01:12:36,172 --> 01:12:39,821
He chocadissima and said:
- This is shameful. How is that even let it?

942
01:12:40,116 --> 01:12:43,515
The doctor explained: Sorry,
this patient has a serious problem...

943
01:12:43,515 --> 01:12:46,990
He thinks  if you do it several times a day
, testicles explode and die.

944
01:12:49,775 --> 01:12:51,574
You know that this can even happen.

945
01:12:51,574 --> 01:12:54,702
So the lady. there understood.
Said. Oh, that's really horrible.

946
01:12:54,702 --> 01:12:55,222
And they continued to visit.

947
01:12:56,068 --> 01:12:59,117
But the room then she sees the nurse
Chavez, good and sexy.

948
01:13:00,029 --> 01:13:01,628
The oral sex in another patient.

949
01:13:02,430 --> 01:13:03,429
The lady went up.

950
01:13:04,688 --> 01:13:06,638
Screaming: How is this justified?

951
01:13:09,874 --> 01:13:12,823
The doctor was so embarrassed
and without knowing what to say.

952
01:13:13,277 --> 01:13:14,927
Then he turned to her and said.

953
01:13:16,187 --> 01:13:18,586
Is the same disease but with better health insurance.

954
01:13:22,314 --> 01:13:23,463
Best health insurance.

955
01:13:31,569 --> 01:13:33,128
Here we are.

956
01:13:37,106 --> 01:13:38,906

01:17:57,838 --> 01:17:58,638
Figured that...

995
01:17:59,693 --> 01:18:01,942
Else could catch
to ride across.

996
01:18:02,434 --> 01:18:03,634
I go to Mirage Lake.

997
01:18:06,399 --> 01:18:08,099
I think I can let you near there.

998
01:18:09,038 --> 01:18:10,357
Fantastic.

999
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:14,437
What are you doing to Lake Mirage?

1000
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:16,381
I have with my girlfriend.

1001
01:18:17,538 --> 01:18:19,437
We notice that you are willing to see.

1002
01:18:19,928 --> 01:18:20,777
Yes, I'm sorry.

1003
01:18:21,673 --> 01:18:22,873

01:18:29,123 --> 01:18:30,122
And whither goest thou?

1005
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:31,727
I will return here.

1006
01:18:33,035 --> 01:18:34,935
These 70km road is my job.

1007
01:18:36,530 --> 01:18:38,680
You walk back and forth all day?

1008
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:39,159
Correct.

1009
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:42,139
Not
wanna know the amount of cars that break down here.

1010
01:18:43,401 --> 01:18:47,000
If cars were insects,
this road would like a web-of-spider

1011
01:18:47,000 --> 01:18:48,376
So you're kind Spider Woman.

1012
01:18:51,083 --> 01:18:55,231
Not in the sense of a black widow spider as
that kills the male after mating.

1013
01:18:56,358 --> 01:18:59,407
I refer to the woman as the _aranha
Superhero, Spiderman.

1014
01:18:59,786 --> 01:19:01,835
What saves people and is adored for it.

1015
01:19:13,495 --> 01:19:14,575
Account there.

1016
01:19:14,575 --> 01:19:15,675
How is your girlfriend?

1017
01:19:17,179 --> 01:19:18,379
's Hottie?

1018
01:19:18,710 --> 01:19:19,549
Why?

1019
01:19:20,048 --> 01:19:20,997
Do you like women?

1020
01:19:23,070 --> 01:19:25,569
Do you think I'm a dyke just because
drive a tow truck?

1021
01:19:26,286 --> 01:19:27,285
Not what I meant.

1022
01:19:27,595 --> 01:19:28,795
I asked you for asking.

1023
01:19:30,295 --> 01:19:31,494
're Humorous.

1024
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:33,920
But, you have someone you like?

1025
01:19:35,398 --> 01:19:36,838
A boyfriend?

1026
01:19:37,468 --> 01:19:38,467
Yes

1027
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:40,540
I've had.

1028
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:44,499
This work does not leave me time
free to date.

1029
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:48,687
I think I'll still get to single reform.

1030
01:19:51,893 --> 01:19:54,392
So it's a good idea
get yourself a vibrator.

1031
01:19:55,568 --> 01:19:56,368
Excellent idea.

1032
01:20:15,526 --> 01:20:16,846
Here we are.

1033
01:20:17,816 --> 01:20:19,615
Here  Daniel.

1034
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:20,743
The Mirage Lake is on.

1035
01:20:23,244 --> 01:20:25,943
I have to get back to work
on my favorite road.

1036
01:20:25,943 --> 01:20:27,594
It was a pleasure to meet you Helen.

1037
01:20:27,594 --> 01:20:29,592
Good luck to you and your girlfriend.

1038
01:20:30,267 --> 01:20:31,347
Thank you.

1039
01:20:31,347 --> 01:20:34,518
And do not worry about boyfriends
If you do not find it you will find.

1040
01:20:35,473 --> 01:20:36,523
Thanks for the ride.

1041
01:20:36,523 --> 01:20:37,023
Always the orders.

1042
01:22:58,907 --> 01:22:59,987
My God.

1043
01:23:18,908 --> 01:23:20,158
Lucy.

1044
01:24:49,177 --> 01:24:50,426
Mom, there's a new word.

1045
01:24:51,000 --> 01:24:52,250
WHAT?

1046
01:24:52,250 --> 01:24:53,490
I just heard a new word.

1047
01:24:53,490 --> 01:24:54,298
What kind of word?

1048
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,070
"Air".

1049
01:32:16,898 --> 01:32:20,847
I bet if you call a tow truck and the car sacares
water, it still works.

1050
01:32:21,767 --> 01:32:23,616
I will not let you lose that bet.

1051
01:32:25,584 --> 01:32:26,784
I have something for you.

1052
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:30,393
Evidence of time travel?

1053
01:32:30,663 --> 01:32:32,312
I never said I would bring thee proof.

1054
01:32:32,784 --> 01:32:34,882
He said he would bring  the photos you need.

1055
01:32:36,468 --> 01:32:37,547
Thank you.

1056
01:32:38,026 --> 01:32:39,076
But call a tow.

1057
01:32:40,067 --> 01:32:41,147
Okay.

1058
01:32:45,181 --> 01:32:46,740
And thank you...

1059
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:47,100
For all

1060
01:32:49,322 --> 01:32:50,372
Take care of yourself.

1061
01:33:35,982 --> 01:33:36,703
Helena

1062
01:34:08,506 --> 01:34:09,456
Towing Service.

Justin Time

1069
01:35:33,831 --> 01:35:35,331
We had a secret signal.

1070
01:35:37,009 --> 01:35:37,858
What do you mean...

1071
01:35:38,711 --> 01:35:41,210
