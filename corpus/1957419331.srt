00:08:31,082 --> 00:08:32,708
You did not tell
him that, did you?

185
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:33,457
No.

186
00:08:34,457 --> 00:08:36,207
Good, good.

187
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,332
You have to play hard to
get, keep him on his toes.

188
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:41,249
Otherwise, he'll
step all over you,

189
00:08:41,332 --> 00:08:43,999
and I will not let
you get stepped on.

190
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:44,874
Okay, but...

191
00:08:47,165 --> 00:08:47,457
What if he loves me too?

192
00:08:50,374 --> 00:08:51,833
Then he won't
let you get away.

193
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,332
Are you sure?

194
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:56,332
Of course I'm sure.

195
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:58,916
I mean, look at me and Carlos.

196
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:00,583
He practically begs me for it.

197
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,583
Look at me and Marty.

198
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,833
Hm?

199
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,791
She does what I
say, when I say it.

200
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:07,708
Okay.

201
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,249
You want to get her attention?

202
00:09:09,332 --> 00:09:10,332
Ignore her.

203
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:11,541
I don't want to
ignore her, man.

204
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:13,291
I just got back, you know?

205
00:09:13,374 --> 00:09:14,583
The less interested
you come across,

206
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,957
the more you'll have her
going wet for you, man.

207
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Okay, I'm gonna
go talk to her.

208
00:09:17,124 --> 00:09:18,416
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

209
00:09:18,499 --> 00:09:19,624
Man up!

210
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:20,916
I'm not gonna be
around to keep you

211
00:09:20,999 --> 00:09:21,957
from getting your heart
broken this time, man.

212
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,791
I'm serious.

213
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:25,583
Listen to me.

214
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:29,957
You've already tried
to chivalry thing.

215
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,499
Where did that get you?

216
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,666
Blue balls all the way to China.

217
00:09:33,749 --> 00:09:34,374
Okay, scratch that.

218
00:09:36,457 --> 00:09:37,708
Treat her like shit
and you'll have her

219
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,332
with her legs wide open
until the sun comes up.

220
00:09:41,249 --> 00:09:42,916
Yeah?

221
00:09:42,999 --> 00:09:43,708
Come on.

222
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,416
It's not like you're out
of options anyway, hm?

223
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,833
I'm sorry I ran out
on you like that before.

224
00:10:01,915 --> 00:10:04,541
I, um...

225
00:10:04,624 --> 00:10:06,791
I'm ready to dance now.

226
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,541
Oh, um...

227
00:10:12,249 --> 00:10:13,291
On the next one, yeah?

228
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:15,040
Excuse me?

229
00:10:16,332 --> 00:10:17,165
What are you doing?

230
00:10:19,124 --> 00:10:20,124
Having a good time.

231
00:10:20,207 --> 00:10:21,124
You should too.

232
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,374
Oh, oh, I will, I will.

233
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,207
What did you do?

234
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:30,165
No, what did you do?

235
00:10:30,249 --> 00:10:31,416
I told him to man up.

236
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:36,040
Psh.

237
00:10:39,624 --> 00:10:41,124
What are you doing?

238
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,124
Fixing this.

Okay, make a little
room, come on, guys.

I'm gonna give you
a little something.

Mm.

Are you happy to be back?

262
00:14:11,707 --> 00:14:13,040
Can I be honest with you?

No.

Hey, no, no, no, no.

265

It has nothing to do with you.

266

You're the only thing
that's making this bearable.

267

I understand.

268
00:14:24,499 --> 00:14:26,332
You want to be with your men.

Yeah, you know, I
should be with my men.

I should be doing
a lot of things.

you don't want me
to be your first?

this is an easy way out,

I'm never gonna be able to

I'm the sinner.

385
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,707
I made a bad choice,

386
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:40,456
and I should live
with the consequences.

387
00:23:41,707 --> 00:23:44,123
But did I really just
make a bad choice,

388
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,081
or was I just not
given the safety

389

Look at that.

913
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:51,621
Beautiful.

914
01:00:53,413 --> 01:00:54,079
You love it, right?

915
01:00:54,162 --> 01:00:55,954
Like, you love it.

916
01:01:00,246 --> 01:01:01,705
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

917
01:01:01,788 --> 01:01:02,870
I love it.

918
01:01:02,954 --> 01:01:04,204
Good, baby.

919
01:01:04,288 --> 01:01:06,538
[lighthearted music]

920
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:13,121
So, you were a typist at
First City Bank for two years,

921
01:01:13,204 --> 01:01:15,079
and then a teller for three.

922
01:01:16,288 --> 01:01:18,246
That's a lot of experience.

923
01:01:18,329 --> 01:01:20,037
Thank you.

924
01:01:20,121 --> 01:01:21,246
Very impressive.

925
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:23,079
Usually we have to
train our girls.

926
01:01:23,996 --> 01:01:26,288
Not me, I'm ready to go.

927
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:28,037
But you don't have a diploma?

928
01:01:28,121 --> 01:01:31,329
No, but as you said, I
have 3 years of experience,

929
01:01:31,413 --> 01:01:34,329
and I work very hard
and learn very fast.

930
01:01:34,413 --> 01:01:35,621
This all looks in order,

931
01:01:35,705 --> 01:01:38,454
we'll just have to call
your previous position

932
01:01:38,538 --> 01:01:41,371
for references, so
just one moment.

933
01:01:42,829 --> 01:01:45,870
[lighthearted music]

934
01:01:53,663 --> 01:01:55,162
We'll be in touch.

935
01:01:55,246 --> 01:01:55,954
We'll reach out.

936
01:01:56,037 --> 01:01:57,121
We'll be in touch.

937
01:01:57,204 --> 01:01:59,413
[lighthearted music]

938
01:02:14,746 --> 01:02:15,454
Hi.

939
01:02:17,329 --> 01:02:18,037
How'd it go?

940
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:29,912
Okay, well, maybe it's good.

941
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:33,829
To spend a little
time at home for once.

942
01:02:33,912 --> 01:02:35,037
I need to work, Mateo.

943
01:02:36,912 --> 01:02:39,288
[chuckling]

944
01:02:39,371 --> 01:02:40,371
Yeah.

945
01:02:40,454 --> 01:02:41,954
Do what you want.

946
01:02:43,288 --> 01:02:44,538
What's the matter with you?

947
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:49,663
I'm just tired of you
acting like what I do

948
01:02:49,745 --> 01:02:51,121
is not enough.

949
01:02:51,204 --> 01:02:52,496
I bet you can't wait
to get back out there.

950
01:02:52,580 --> 01:02:56,496
I wish you cared about
your house and your kid

951
01:02:56,580 --> 01:02:57,329
as much as you do
about your work.

952
01:03:00,663 --> 01:03:00,745
I'm leaving.

953
01:03:03,288 --> 01:03:04,329
Where are you going?

954
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:06,996
I'm going to work, see
if I can pick up a shift

955
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:08,329
since we're so hard up.

956
01:03:10,288 --> 01:03:13,413
I didn't know you needed
cologne to put up drywall.

957
01:03:14,454 --> 01:03:17,037
[somber music]

958
01:04:08,037 --> 01:04:09,454
Yeah, yeah, I know.

959
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,413
[dramatic music]

960
01:04:26,246 --> 01:04:28,371
I have to get going now.

961
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:32,704
All right.

962
01:04:35,704 --> 01:04:37,704
How's that, we feeling cleaner?

963
01:04:37,787 --> 01:04:38,496
Yeah.

964
01:04:38,580 --> 01:04:41,079
Yeah, a little bit?

965
01:04:41,162 --> 01:04:42,996
You got this one spot right here

966
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,204
that I just can't get off.

967
01:04:46,121 --> 01:04:49,037
[melancholic music]

968
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:07,829
I'm calling about the
studio in Kearny Street.

969
01:05:07,912 --> 01:05:09,162
Celina Guerrera.

970
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:11,787
I spoke with you
last week as well.

971
01:05:13,662 --> 01:05:14,454
No pets.

972
01:05:15,996 --> 01:05:17,620
It's just for me and my son.

973
01:05:21,246 --> 01:05:22,371
Do you know what's
holding up the decision?

974
01:05:26,246 --> 01:05:29,329
Well, I'm looking for
something as soon as possible,

975
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:31,121
so anything that's available...

976
01:05:32,954 --> 01:05:35,204
Hello?

977
01:05:37,954 --> 01:05:38,662
God!

978
01:05:47,329 --> 01:05:50,037
[calming music]

979
01:06:05,204 --> 01:06:06,121
Celina?

980
01:06:07,246 --> 01:06:08,121
Minerva?

981
01:06:09,704 --> 01:06:10,745
Calvin.

982
01:06:10,829 --> 01:06:11,662
How are you?

983
01:06:11,745 --> 01:06:13,288
You two know each other?

984
01:06:14,662 --> 01:06:16,037
Baby, this is the
teller that helped me

985
01:06:16,121 --> 01:06:17,329
with that Patterson job.

986
01:06:18,787 --> 01:06:19,454
That was you?

987
01:06:22,996 --> 01:06:23,912
Why did you do that?

988
01:06:26,912 --> 01:06:27,579
It wasn't fair.

989
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:32,579
People won't rent to single moms

990
01:06:32,662 --> 01:06:34,496
even if you pay in advance.

991
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:37,079
Why don't you stay with us

992
01:06:37,162 --> 01:06:37,537
until you get on your feet?

993
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:41,371
I can't.

994
01:06:43,413 --> 01:06:45,204
This is not the
time to be stubborn.

995
01:06:47,246 --> 01:06:48,704
What she means is that
we know a thing or two

996
01:06:48,787 --> 01:06:50,537
about being
discriminated against.

997
01:06:58,329 --> 01:07:00,329
It's just,
Christian's gone through

998
01:07:00,413 --> 01:07:02,204
so much change as it is.

999
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:06,954
I'd like the next
place to be our last.

1000
01:07:08,870 --> 01:07:09,579
But thank you.

1001
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:23,329
So you know where to find us.

1002
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:34,204
Yeah, we're going to go
over and talk to him right now

1003
01:07:34,288 --> 01:07:35,204
and try to get-

1004
01:07:35,288 --> 01:07:36,745
- Ma'am, please stay outside.

1005
01:07:36,829 --> 01:07:37,537
No, no, no, this is my son.

1006
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:39,121
Get out of the way!

1007
01:07:39,204 --> 01:07:40,537
Hi, papito.

1008
01:07:40,620 --> 01:07:41,413
Hey, papito.

1009
01:07:41,495 --> 01:07:42,620
Are you okay?

1010
01:07:42,704 --> 01:07:43,704
What happened?

1011
01:07:43,787 --> 01:07:45,079
I don't know.

1012
01:07:45,162 --> 01:07:46,495
What happened?

1013
01:07:46,579 --> 01:07:47,579
He fell from the counter
trying to get a snack

1014
01:07:47,662 --> 01:07:49,371
and he fractured his arm.

1015
01:07:49,453 --> 01:07:51,745
You're lucky, it
could've been much worse.

1016
01:07:51,829 --> 01:07:53,329
Does it hurt?

1017
01:07:53,413 --> 01:07:54,954
Not that much.

1018
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:55,371
I'll have to report this.

1019
01:07:57,329 --> 01:07:58,495
Report this?

1020
01:07:58,579 --> 01:08:00,371
He was clearly unsupervised.

1021
01:08:00,453 --> 01:08:00,537
What?

1022
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:04,495
Angry yet?

1023
01:08:04,579 --> 01:08:06,162
Frustrated?

1024
01:08:06,246 --> 01:08:08,829
Ready to rip your
fucking skin off?

1025
01:08:08,912 --> 01:08:10,579
Want to scream at
the top of your lungs

1026
01:08:10,662 --> 01:08:13,246
no matter who is hearing?

1027
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:14,037
Good!

1028
01:08:15,662 --> 01:08:17,204
He was sleeping!

1029
01:08:17,288 --> 01:08:19,079
You don't leave
a child by itself!

1030
01:08:19,162 --> 01:08:20,662
Leave him alone!

1031
01:08:20,745 --> 01:08:21,954
It's not his fault you
let yourself get pregnant.

1032
01:08:22,037 --> 01:08:23,954
[speaking in Spanish]

1033
01:08:24,037 --> 01:08:26,996
Oh, this is America,
speak English!

1034
01:08:27,079 --> 01:08:28,495
- Shut the hell up!
- Celina, Celina!

1035
01:08:28,579 --> 01:08:30,162
Can we talk, please?

1036
01:08:30,246 --> 01:08:31,079
What happened-

1037
01:08:31,162 --> 01:08:31,537
- No, no, don't touch him!

1038
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:35,579
You knew Carlos had
sent other girls

1039
01:08:35,662 --> 01:08:36,870
to the dentist, didn't you?

1040
01:08:36,954 --> 01:08:38,329
And it hadn't gone
well, you knew!

1041
01:08:38,412 --> 01:08:39,996
No, I didn't know,
no, I didn't know!

1042
01:08:40,079 --> 01:08:40,954
- You did, bullshit!
- I didn't!

1043
01:08:41,037 --> 01:08:42,204
- I didn't fucking know!
- Bullshit!

1044
01:08:42,288 --> 01:08:44,288
I didn't know!

1045
01:08:44,371 --> 01:08:46,329
Why would I send you
to a butcher, huh?

1046
01:08:46,412 --> 01:08:47,329
Why would I do that?

1047
01:08:49,370 --> 01:08:50,954
You said we'd
be safe with you.

1048
01:08:52,537 --> 01:08:52,579
Hm?

1049
01:08:56,246 --> 01:08:57,246
Cel, can...

1050
01:08:58,121 --> 01:08:58,829
Hey!

1051
01:08:59,996 --> 01:09:02,412
[somber music]

1052
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:12,579
How is he?

1053
01:09:15,037 --> 01:09:15,829
He's strong.

1054
01:09:19,162 --> 01:09:20,537
I wonder how he's gonna
remember all of this.

1055
01:09:23,162 --> 01:09:24,453
Will he ever understand
what it was like?

1056
01:09:27,996 --> 01:09:29,495
They always do in the end.

1057
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:37,579
Goodnight.

1058
01:10:13,662 --> 01:10:14,662
Oh, papito.

1059
01:10:15,912 --> 01:10:18,162
How do I keep you
from turning into one?

1060
01:10:21,246 --> 01:10:22,121
Huh?

1061
01:10:39,870 --> 01:10:43,620
To end the war, and bring
peace with honor in Vietnam

1062
01:10:43,704 --> 01:10:45,037
and in Southeast Asia.

1063
01:10:45,121 --> 01:10:47,662
On January 27th, 1973,

1064
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:50,537
at the International
Conference Center in Paris.

1065
01:10:50,620 --> 01:10:54,996
The ceasefire will take effect
at 2400 Greenwich Mean Time,

1066
01:10:55,079 --> 01:10:57,162
January 27th, 1973.

1067

The United States and
the Democratic Republic-

1068
01:10:59,912 --> 01:11:00,704
- [Man] Turn that shit off.

1069
01:11:00,787 --> 01:11:01,870
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1070
01:11:01,954 --> 01:11:04,204
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1071
01:11:04,287 --> 01:11:05,079
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1072
01:11:05,162 --> 01:11:05,412
Someone sitting here?

1073
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:11,162
Peace with honor.

1074
01:11:13,162 --> 01:11:16,453
Ah, what's this
country coming to?

1075
01:11:16,537 --> 01:11:17,954
Eh?

1076
01:11:18,037 --> 01:11:20,662
There is no honor in losing.

1077
01:11:22,579 --> 01:11:24,495
Men used to know that.

1078
01:11:24,579 --> 01:11:26,745
You don't know what
you're talking about.

1079
01:11:26,829 --> 01:11:27,870
Ceasefire is not losing.

1080
01:11:27,954 --> 01:11:30,162
There aren't no
real men anymore.

1081
01:11:30,245 --> 01:11:32,204
You better watch your mouth.

1082
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:33,453
Okay, you weren't there.

1083
01:11:35,453 --> 01:11:36,579
Neither were you.

1084
01:11:38,287 --> 01:11:38,996
Oh...

1085
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:39,912
Sit down!

1086
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:42,870
Oh, oh, now he wants to fight!

1087
01:11:42,954 --> 01:11:44,328
All right, soldier boy.

1088
01:11:44,412 --> 01:11:47,245
Bam, come on, vamo, vamo.

1089
01:11:47,328 --> 01:11:47,996
Eh?

1090
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:50,037
Come on.

1091
01:11:50,121 --> 01:11:51,287
Oh, you don't want to fight?

1092
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:52,704
What, you're a coward?

1214

[Reporter] The Supreme
Court today ruled

1215
01:20:29,579 --> 01:20:31,911
that abortion is
completely a private matter

1216
01:20:31,995 --> 01:20:34,078
to be decided by
mother and doctor

1217
01:20:34,161 --> 01:20:36,287
in the first three
months of pregnancy.

The 7 to 2 ruling to that effect

1219
01:20:38,412 --> 01:20:40,579
will probably result
in a drastic overhaul

1220
01:20:40,661 --> 01:20:42,412

01:20:42,495 --> 01:20:44,869

today overturned laws

in Texas and Georgia,

1223
01:20:45,911 --> 01:20:48,036
and ruled the
government has no right

1224
01:20:48,120 --> 01:20:50,161
to enter into a decision
which should be made

1225

a state may regulate
abortion procedures,

1228
01:20:57,453 --> 01:20:59,828
but only to ensure the
safety of the mother.
