1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,053
<i>After you've gone</i>

2
00:00:06,053 --> 00:00:09,686
<i>And left me crying</i>

3
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:14,445
<i>After you've gone</i>

4
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,869
<i>there's no denying</i>

5
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:19,914
<i>I'm gonna haunt you so</i>

6
00:00:19,914 --> 00:00:21,543
<i>I'm gonna taunt you so</i>

7
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:24,214
<i>It's gonna drive you</i>
<i>to ruin</i>

8
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:44,626
Surprise daddy.

9
00:01:44,626 --> 00:01:48,382
-Whoa!
-Let the bachelor weekend
commence!

10
00:01:48,424 --> 00:01:49,719
A whole weekend?

11
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,723
Three sassy days
and two glorious nights.

12
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:54,144
- Your last hurrah.
- Anything for our Larry.

13
00:01:54,353 --> 00:01:57,150
Oh children! Oh.

14
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,654
It is so much better
in person.

15
00:01:58,654 --> 00:02:00,365
Um, so espooky.

16
00:02:00,448 --> 00:02:02,912
Oh, this architecture,
I am having a moment.

17
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:04,832
Hello?

18
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:09,007
Well, you never know.

19
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,723
Did you really
have to blindfold me?

20
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,602
Full fantasy or go home,
you know.

21
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:16,438
-I packed your bag, Larry.
-Yeah, he did.

22
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,317
Right after we kidnapped you
and shoved you
in the backseat.

23
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:19,319
Oh, my idea.

24
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,948
And you were screaming,
you remember that, Larry?

25
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:23,286
I mean, it was loud,
but you were so cute.

26
00:02:23,369 --> 00:02:24,539
I was embarrassed.

27
00:02:24,914 --> 00:02:26,417
You remembered my night creme?

28
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:30,341
I mean,
I just packed everything
in your medicine cabinet.

29
00:02:30,341 --> 00:02:32,262
-Oh, a lot of that stuff
was Jamie's.
-Oh yeah.

30
00:02:32,262 --> 00:02:34,934
I didn't know which toothbrush
was yours,
so I just grabbed both.

31
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,022
Sorry to your fiancé
and his filthy mouth.

32
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:38,859
Well,
it's gonna be filthy now.

33
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:43,535
I cannot believe
that Jamie kept this a secret.

34
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,754
You should probably call him
and tell him
where you are.

35
00:02:48,754 --> 00:02:51,300
-Jesus Christ!
-Hey, but we're together.

36
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,262
-Four old friends.
-Who sometimes kiss.

37
00:02:53,304 --> 00:02:54,306
What?

38
00:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,517
No, we don't kiss.

39
00:02:55,517 --> 00:02:57,020
Not even on special occasions?

40
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:59,942
Well, what's the point
of having friends
if you don't kiss?

41
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:02,155
Okay. Well, no one kiss me.

42
00:03:02,238 --> 00:03:04,451
Yeah. And I certainly
don't need any kisses.

43
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:05,829
Mmm, that's right.

44
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,167
You've been talking
to that guy.
Was it Dmitri?

45
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:12,467
Actually, uh,
it didn't work out.

46
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:19,106
Yeah. So, argh,
I'm freshly single now
and feeling great about it.

47
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,992
Yes, yes.

48
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:26,120
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:27,372 --> 00:03:29,877
Okay. This place is crazy.

50
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,255
I know, right?

51
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:35,012
If I lived in a house
like this,
I would never wear clothes.

52
00:03:35,054 --> 00:03:36,516
Oh! Oh, imagine... imagine...

53
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:40,481
imagine me, burning
my husband's manuscripts

54
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:42,277
in this fireplace.

55
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:43,905
-Amy March.
-Ooh. Kathy Bates.

56
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:46,703
-Hedda Gabler.
-Hedda. Yes.
I am such a Hedda.

57
00:03:46,828 --> 00:03:47,830
Drama.

58
00:03:48,122 --> 00:03:49,542
Drama!

59
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,882
Do we have a staircase?
A fancy staircase.

60
00:03:52,923 --> 00:03:55,094
I'm looking
for a fancy staircase.

61
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:58,225
I have found
my fancy staircase

62
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,898
and she's... creaky.

63
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,110
Wait, who am I? Who am I?

64
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,112
Marilyn?

65
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:05,699
-Rachael Leigh Cook.
-Lena Horne.

66
00:04:05,782 --> 00:04:07,410
Yes! Lena Horne.

67
00:04:07,912 --> 00:04:09,498
Well, we have it all weekend.

68
00:04:11,126 --> 00:04:12,170
Jesus. She's loud.

69
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,009
It cost a small fortune,
but what's money
between friends?

70
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,263
-I'm still waiting
on that Venmo.
-It's coming, boo.

71
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:19,852
- Are
these complimentary?
- Put it down.

72
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,691
Reggie made a whole roster
of activities.

73
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:25,321
Which I suggest we get
to because tonight we
have our rehearsal

74
00:04:25,321 --> 00:04:27,701
for the end
of weekend performance.

75
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,329
-"After You've Gone?"
-"After You've Gone."

76
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:32,126
Is there harmony?
Because,
I can only hear minor thirds.

77
00:04:32,962 --> 00:04:35,424
Please tell me
you brought the wigs.

78
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:37,721
Stacey.

79
00:04:37,972 --> 00:04:38,974
-Sheila.
-Yes!

80
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:40,811
-Bridgette.
-Too many white women!

81
00:04:41,395 --> 00:04:42,606
Josephine.

82
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:43,858
Hello, Ms. Baker.

83
00:04:43,858 --> 00:04:45,571
-I bequeath her onto you.
-Thank you.

84
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:47,073
Kevin, do you know the steps?

85
00:04:47,073 --> 00:04:49,202
-Did you want to teach me?
-I'll teach him.

86
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:50,329
Children!

87
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:54,129
I am officially leaving Jamie
for the three of you.

88
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:56,174
I love you. Thank you.

89
00:04:56,174 --> 00:04:57,511
You only get married once.

90
00:05:04,441 --> 00:05:05,861
Dmitri loved flowers.

91
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,075
I mean,
we never met in person,

92
00:05:09,075 --> 00:05:10,746
but every day
he text me pictures

93
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:12,415
of the most beautiful
arrangements.

94
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,627
So what happened?

95
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,258
He turned out to be
an algorithm designed
to disenfranchised voters.

96
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:21,433
Men.

97
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,064
I mean,
where did you even
find this place?

98
00:05:24,064 --> 00:05:26,903
You said no Fire Island,
no Palm Springs.

99
00:05:26,903 --> 00:05:28,740
I mean, can you imagine
the kind of person

100
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,493
that would even...
I mean, can you?

101
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:31,704
-Yes.
-And...

102
00:05:32,205 --> 00:05:33,290
should I tell him?

103
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,756
Tell me. Tell me. Tell me.

104
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,054
It's haunted.

105
00:05:41,431 --> 00:05:43,310
I knew it. I knew it.

106
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,024
I didn't want to jinx it,
but I felt it in my bones.

107
00:05:47,276 --> 00:05:48,362
Tell me everything.

108
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:54,625
According to the National
Haunted House Locator's
online forum--

109
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:55,877
So you know it's legit.

110
00:05:55,877 --> 00:05:57,548
Well, you can feel it
in the air.

111
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,967
It's thick, you know?

112
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,350
Okay Reggie,
tell him the legend.

113
00:06:04,018 --> 00:06:05,020
All right.

114
00:06:05,689 --> 00:06:08,026
One hundred years ago,
the original owner--

115
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,028
I need a name.

116
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:11,491
Sylvia Lawrence.

117
00:06:12,619 --> 00:06:14,330
<i>She was driven mad</i>

118
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:17,170
<i>and murdered her only son</i>
<i>in cold blood.</i>

119
00:06:22,681 --> 00:06:23,933
Was he a lot to handle?

120
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,562
Listen to this.

121
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:28,693
Sylvia Lawrence,
widow and mad woman,

122
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:31,072
discovered dead
after murdering son.

123
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:33,578
What a shady lady.

124
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,124
Sylvia Lawrence
of Suffolk County

125
00:06:36,249 --> 00:06:40,216
was executed in her home
on the 21st day of October

126
00:06:40,257 --> 00:06:42,638
at the hands
of unidentified culprits.

127
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,938
<i>The incident occurred</i>
<i>mere hours</i>

128
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:50,695
<i>after Ms. Lawrence</i>
<i>stabbed her only son,</i>
<i>Phillip Lawrence.</i>

129
00:06:56,248 --> 00:06:59,672
And allegedly buried his body
on the Lawrence estate.

130
00:07:01,174 --> 00:07:04,389
Local authorities said justice
was rightfully served

131
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,857
as Ms. Lawrence
would have been executed
by the state for her crime.

132
00:07:09,775 --> 00:07:11,278
Fantastic.

133
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:12,656
And some say,

134
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,873
late at night,
if you listen very close.

135
00:07:19,002 --> 00:07:20,004
I have that lamp.

136
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:22,634
-Oh.
-All right.

137
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,680
Okay boys,
so first item on the agenda.

138
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,182
Oh, it's color coded.

139
00:07:26,182 --> 00:07:29,022
Um, before that,
I have a little surprise.

140
00:07:29,188 --> 00:07:31,861
-We're actually done
with surprises for today.
-Are we?

141
00:07:31,861 --> 00:07:34,407
-Because I brought my book
of spells.
-Stop it.

142
00:07:34,575 --> 00:07:36,411
And my crystal ball.

143
00:07:36,411 --> 00:07:38,040
Oh, I love magic.

144
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,044
-This wasn't
in any of our texts.
-Right.

145
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,254
A surprise.

146
00:07:41,756 --> 00:07:44,177
What do you think?
A little séance?

147
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:45,387
- Absolutely.
- Yes.

148
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,766
Bring back Dmitri.

149
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:51,525
No. I'm feeling like
this bachelor weekend's
going to be all about...

150
00:07:52,151 --> 00:07:54,823
<i>Summoning Sylvia</i>

151
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,913
Sylvia

152
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:04,802
-Yes.
-All right.
I guess we can squeeze it in.

153
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:06,388
Oh, I should call Jamie.

154
00:08:06,388 --> 00:08:09,185
Yes, you do that
and we will go explore. Yeah.

155
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:12,233
The woodwork,
the style, the glamour.

156
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,368
-Hi baby.
-<i>What are you doing</i>

157
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:18,453
FaceTiming while driving?

158
00:08:18,453 --> 00:08:20,165
I'm using the car mount
you got me.

159
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:22,420
-Oh, pull over.
-Okay. Okay. Alright. Alright.

160
00:08:24,508 --> 00:08:27,138
So, are you excited
about tonight?

161
00:08:27,263 --> 00:08:29,392
The boys already picked me up,
actually.

162
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:31,021
Wait, where are you?

163
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:34,277
They took me upstate
to this epic haunted house.

164
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,283
-Like, people actually
died here.
-You're upstate?

165
00:08:37,659 --> 00:08:39,538
How long are you going
to be upstate?

166
00:08:39,913 --> 00:08:41,499
-Um, three days.
-What?

167
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,794
It wasn't my idea.

168
00:08:42,794 --> 00:08:44,673
-I didn't know anything
about it.
-Ugh.

169
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:45,967
Why didn’t anyone tell me?

170
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,929
Well, you know,
you can't keep secrets.

171
00:08:48,263 --> 00:08:49,265
Okay.

172
00:08:49,265 --> 00:08:51,478
Hey, let me show you around.

173
00:08:51,937 --> 00:08:53,023
Here's a dead bird.

174
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:55,152
Babe, what about my brother?

175
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:57,824
<i>You're supposed to spend</i>
<i>the whole day with him.</i>

176
00:08:58,576 --> 00:09:00,120
Tux shopping, shoes;

177
00:09:00,287 --> 00:09:01,916
<i>you're the one</i>
<i>who suggested it.</i>

178
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:03,711
Mm-hmm. Can you take him?

179
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,255
I'm working.

180
00:09:05,297 --> 00:09:06,341
Can he take an Uber?

181
00:09:06,341 --> 00:09:09,222
I just, I really wanted
you guys to get
to know each other.

182
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:12,394
We talked for like an hour
the other night
and he had nothing to say.

183
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:13,940
Well, he takes a while
to warm up,

184
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,361
but I know he will love you
once he gets to know you.

185
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:17,363
Well.

186
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,910
Most of his friends
are still in Kuwait and...

187
00:09:20,912 --> 00:09:23,250
<i>you know, he and I</i>
<i>just started talking again.</i>

188
00:09:23,668 --> 00:09:25,420
-Um.
-No, it's okay. It's okay.

189
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:27,592
<i>Tell everyone I say hi.</i>

190
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,847
-I can come back.
-What? No.

191
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:31,851
No, no. I can be home
in a couple hours

192
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:34,105
and spend the day
with Harrison
and then be back here tonight.

193
00:09:34,105 --> 00:09:36,527
And leave the boys up there?
They'll hate me.

194
00:09:36,527 --> 00:09:38,906
I'm not going to throw you
under the bus, babe.
Don't worry.

195
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:40,535
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

196
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:42,079
I, um...

197
00:09:43,498 --> 00:09:44,543
do you hear that?

198
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,256
Hear what?

199
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:50,220
Wait, wait Larry.

200
00:10:53,013 --> 00:10:54,808
Excuse me, Miss.
Where are you going?

201
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,352
Getting some ice.

202
00:10:57,522 --> 00:10:58,941
You think I didn’t get ice?

203
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,279
But did you get enough?

204
00:11:02,699 --> 00:11:04,410
Get out of the car.

205
00:11:10,882 --> 00:11:13,219
Oh, you know what?

206
00:11:13,637 --> 00:11:16,184
I have to call Jamie
really quick.

207
00:11:17,061 --> 00:11:18,063
-Again?
-Mmhmm.

208
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,568
Okay.
But we should really work

209
00:11:20,568 --> 00:11:23,156
-on this co-dependency thing
this weekend.
-What?

210
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:34,554
Hey.

211
00:11:35,305 --> 00:11:36,307
<i>You on the road?</i>

212
00:11:38,353 --> 00:11:39,815
Hello?

213
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:42,361
What if Harrison came here?

214
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:45,660
Really?

215
00:11:46,745 --> 00:11:47,747
Yes.

216
00:11:47,747 --> 00:11:49,584
Sure he wouldn't be crashing?
I wouldn't want to...

217
00:11:49,584 --> 00:11:51,462
You know what,
I spoke before thinking

218
00:11:52,089 --> 00:11:54,135
-and I didn't think it
through.
-Oh yeah.

219
00:11:54,468 --> 00:11:56,807
And I'm not going to lie.
The truth is, is that

220
00:11:56,932 --> 00:11:58,435
we would love
to have him here.

221
00:11:58,936 --> 00:11:59,938
Oh!

222
00:12:01,441 --> 00:12:03,779
And everyone's cool with that?

223
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,451
Yes.
Right children?

224
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:11,335
Every, everyone's so excited.

225
00:12:13,381 --> 00:12:14,383
Okay.

226
00:12:14,926 --> 00:12:17,557
Yeah, I'll run it by Harrison.

227
00:12:17,557 --> 00:12:19,811
He could probably drive there
in a few hours.

228
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:23,151
-Are you sure though?
I don't want to, uh.
-Oh, yay!

229
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,779
I'll send you the address.

230
00:12:24,988 --> 00:12:26,491
Okay, great.

231
00:12:27,075 --> 00:12:29,079
Wow. Thank you, babe.

232
00:12:29,748 --> 00:12:30,917
That is really sweet.

233
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,298
It's so thoughtful of you
to think about Harrison

234
00:12:34,298 --> 00:12:37,262
in terms of, like,
what he needs and in terms
of what I need, of course,

235
00:12:37,262 --> 00:12:39,225
and... and then also in terms
of what your friends need.

236
00:12:39,225 --> 00:12:42,524
This is why you...
you're like a nurturer,

237
00:12:42,524 --> 00:12:45,571
but you're also a gatherer,
because you've gathered
everyone together

238
00:12:45,571 --> 00:12:49,286
and you're still finding a way
to nurture everyone
at the same time.

239
00:12:49,328 --> 00:12:51,040
Hello? Larry?

240
00:12:55,508 --> 00:12:58,012
Oh, there he is.

241
00:12:58,012 --> 00:12:59,014
Join us.

242
00:12:59,181 --> 00:13:02,564
I uh, I have something
to tell you.

243
00:13:02,689 --> 00:13:05,528
Oh, tell us
through the art of dance!

244
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:08,659
<i>Oh my good lord what a feeling</i>

245
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:12,457
<i>All of this joy</i>
<i>I’ve been stealing</i>

246
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:15,046
<i>We all need someone</i>

247
00:13:15,255 --> 00:13:17,719
<i>Someone</i>
<i>that can make us believe</i>

248
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:19,889
<i>Make us believe</i>

249
00:13:20,808 --> 00:13:23,396
<i>So call me a man on a mission</i>

250
00:13:24,566 --> 00:13:27,112
<i>I'm guilty by my own admission</i>

251
00:13:27,112 --> 00:13:28,114
<i>Stop it!</i>

252
00:13:28,114 --> 00:13:30,076
<i>Locked up but I break free</i>

253
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:31,997
<i>No chains could ever take me</i>

254
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:35,378
<i>Can’t stop, won’t stop,</i>
<i>don’t stop now</i>

255
00:13:36,923 --> 00:13:37,925
Oh my God!

256
00:13:38,134 --> 00:13:40,180
-Uh, square!
-Sassy secretary.

257
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,059
-Schindler's List!
-Yes.

258
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:46,902
<i>Hold me a little closer</i>

259
00:13:46,902 --> 00:13:50,200
Can’t stop, won’t stop,
don’t stop now

260
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,922
You are my soul, my religion

261
00:13:58,091 --> 00:14:00,680
You are my best decision

262
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:03,686
Whatever it takes

263
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:06,440
I’m ready to break
my own rules

264
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:08,361
Break the rules

265
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:10,574
Oh God!

266
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:11,827
-Oh! Are you okay?
-Oh my God!

267
00:14:11,827 --> 00:14:14,123
See, this is why
we have to be careful
where we twirl.

268
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:15,125
Don't limit me.

269
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,839
Next up, we have wine
and design, and then
we can chat room assignments.

270
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,299
-Ah.
-I'll room with you.

271
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,385
We have our own rooms, hun.

272
00:14:20,385 --> 00:14:22,431
Yeah, we have ours
and they have theirs.

273
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:23,976
-No we --
-So Reg,

274
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,145
I'm going to need two rooms;

275
00:14:25,145 --> 00:14:26,940
a suite for me
and a receiving lounge
for my guests.

276
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,067
-What guests?!
-Oh, okay.

277
00:14:28,109 --> 00:14:30,948
So actually Jamie
was on the phone
and you know what?

278
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,618
-Oh, Mama.
-What?

279
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,956
Property of S. Lawrence.

280
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,461
Are those hers? Oh.

281
00:14:39,632 --> 00:14:41,051
She's so scary.

282
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:42,345
And he's so beautiful.

283
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:44,851
He is a pretty boy.
And this is before FaceTune.

284
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,437
Mmm.

285
00:14:46,479 --> 00:14:48,149
What do you say? Should we...

286
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:49,903
Meet these icons,
get the full story,

287
00:14:49,944 --> 00:14:52,365
maybe I hook up with Phillip?
Yeah,
I could whip something up.

288
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:16,998
Phone's away.

289
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,090
Sisters.

290
00:15:22,927 --> 00:15:24,931
- Have you done this before?
- Bitch,

291
00:15:25,808 --> 00:15:27,937
do you know how many times
I've seen Wicked?

292
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,318
-What does that have to do --
-14 times.

293
00:15:31,653 --> 00:15:36,078
So do not question my devotion
to the dark arts.

294
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:44,303
Nico, you are the witchiest
of us all.

295
00:15:44,804 --> 00:15:45,973
You may proceed.

296
00:15:50,148 --> 00:15:52,987
Actually. I.. just kidding,
I need to be right back.

297
00:15:52,987 --> 00:15:55,033
I promise I'll be right back.
One second.

298
00:15:58,832 --> 00:15:59,834
The gall.

299
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:07,767
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

300
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:09,269
I was just thinking,
if Harrison
doesn't want to come,

301
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,065
-I definitely don't want
to make him.
-You're not.

302
00:16:11,273 --> 00:16:15,198
I mean, Nico is wearing a lot
of foundation.

303
00:16:16,701 --> 00:16:17,912
Harrison doesn't care
about that.

304
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:21,920
And Reggie wants us
to practice the harmony parts,
it's a tight quartet...

305
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,922
He's almost there.

306
00:16:23,464 --> 00:16:26,428
-I thought everyone
was cool with it.
-No they are. I am.

307
00:16:26,972 --> 00:16:28,307
If you didn't want him
to come,
you shouldn't have --

308
00:16:28,307 --> 00:16:29,309
No, I do.

309
00:16:30,103 --> 00:16:31,773
I want him here. I swear.

310
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,986
-Do you want him
to turn around?
-No,

311
00:16:35,531 --> 00:16:36,700
-it'll be great.
-<i>Okay.</i>

312
00:16:37,618 --> 00:16:39,204
<i>Text me when he gets there.</i>

313
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,738
Great.
So now that I've warmed up.

314
00:17:17,322 --> 00:17:19,744
So really quick,
I just got off the phone
with Jamie --

315
00:17:19,744 --> 00:17:20,746
Silence.

316
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,044
-What was that?
-Oh, my hand.

317
00:17:24,044 --> 00:17:26,966
-Someone grabbed my hand.
-Hmm,
I see it's already working.

318
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,054
Says we need an offering.

319
00:17:29,262 --> 00:17:30,306
Like a sacrifice?

320
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:31,976
Haven't I sacrificed enough
this year?

321
00:17:31,976 --> 00:17:33,814
-We can kill Nico.
-I could fuck your father.

322
00:17:33,814 --> 00:17:34,816
Children!

323
00:17:40,536 --> 00:17:41,538
I got it.

324
00:17:42,163 --> 00:17:49,094
The average spirit
accepts food, drinks, herbs,
flowers, poems, songs...

325
00:17:53,018 --> 00:17:59,866
<i>Somebody once told me</i>
<i>the world is gonna roll me</i>

326
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:06,588
<i>I ain't the sharpest tool</i>
<i>in the shed</i>

327
00:18:07,673 --> 00:18:13,475
<i>She was looking kind of dumb</i>
<i>with her finger and her thumb</i>

328
00:18:13,475 --> 00:18:18,528
<i>In the shape of an "L"</i>
<i>on her forehead</i>

329
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:23,329
Let's begin.

330
00:18:28,757 --> 00:18:31,930
We summon you, oh spirit

331
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:35,353
from your eternal rest,

332
00:18:36,396 --> 00:18:42,534
inviting you to join us
as our immortal guest.

333
00:18:49,924 --> 00:18:53,723
Privacy be gone and open up
your eyes.

334
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:54,934
Why are you British?

335
00:18:55,769 --> 00:19:00,403
Materialize here
from the parting of the skies.

336
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:02,825
I'm done.

337
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,039
Here's your place.

338
00:19:10,298 --> 00:19:13,888
Years in the dark
'til your pathway is lighted

339
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:17,312
as you and the earth
are at last reunited.

340
00:19:17,521 --> 00:19:18,523
Okay. This is cute.

341
00:19:18,523 --> 00:19:20,736
-Reggie.
-Oh but he can be British?

342
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:21,988
It's jus' me voice!

343
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,589
Tell us your story
and then you are free --

344
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:32,593
-We're right here.
-Oh.

345
00:19:34,555 --> 00:19:37,226
Tell us your story
and then you are free.

346
00:19:37,603 --> 00:19:40,609
Spirit, oh spirit,

347
00:19:41,944 --> 00:19:43,030
we're summoning thee.

348
00:19:46,411 --> 00:19:47,413
That's it.

349
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,175
And then I blow out
the candle.

350
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:56,223
Here we go.

351
00:20:33,297 --> 00:20:34,508
Are you Phillip?

352
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,554
Ask him where he's buried.

353
00:20:36,554 --> 00:20:37,806
I don't think it's him.

354
00:20:37,806 --> 00:20:38,808
Then it's Sylvia.

355
00:20:38,933 --> 00:20:41,480
-Is it a man or a woman?
-Stop gendering ghosts!

356
00:20:42,106 --> 00:20:43,108
Hey!

357
00:20:43,317 --> 00:20:44,319
Larry, no!

358
00:20:44,612 --> 00:20:45,614
Larry, no!

359
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:02,731
-Is this the bachelor party?
-Oh my God!

360
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,192
What?

361
00:21:04,442 --> 00:21:05,486
Reggie, you slut.

362
00:21:05,695 --> 00:21:08,116
-What'd I do?
-Reggie hired a stripper!

363
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,124
All right big boy,
show me
what you're working with?

364
00:21:12,124 --> 00:21:13,126
Guys, stop it.

365
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,172
Stop. Stop. Guys, stop it.

366
00:21:15,214 --> 00:21:17,134
Stop. Stop. Stop.

367
00:21:19,974 --> 00:21:22,019
Yeah. I...
I didn't order a stripper.

368
00:21:22,771 --> 00:21:29,284
Hey. So children, huh, guys,
this is Harrison.

369
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:32,541
Jamie's brother.

370
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:37,801
He's going to be joining us
for the weekend.

371
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:42,853
-You mean he's dressed
like that for real?
-Yes.

372
00:21:42,936 --> 00:21:46,527
Seems strange.
I don't remember you
telling me about any of this.

373
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:48,656
-I was trying to.
-And he's straight?

374
00:21:48,656 --> 00:21:49,700
He can't help that.

375
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:51,829
I like your camo.

376
00:21:51,912 --> 00:21:54,208
Okay. I really
would've appreciated
a heads up.

377
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,419
I spent a lot of time...

378
00:21:55,419 --> 00:21:57,256
Did you fly in from Iraq?

379
00:21:57,256 --> 00:21:58,718
Okay, look. No.

380
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,350
Guys, it's my bachelor party.

381
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:04,354
Okay. And Harrison is family.

382
00:22:05,774 --> 00:22:06,776
Future family.

383
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:08,821
He's my brother, brother.

384
00:22:08,946 --> 00:22:10,617
He's my brother-in-law

385
00:22:11,702 --> 00:22:14,290
and we're going to make him
feel really comfortable.

386
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:20,595
You're all gay.

387
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:29,530
So Harrison, um,

388
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,742
there's actually
only four bedrooms here

389
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:33,328
so I could have
accommodated you

390
00:22:33,328 --> 00:22:35,374
if I would've known
about this adorable plan.

391
00:22:35,374 --> 00:22:36,376
Again, I am happy to room
with someone.

392
00:22:36,376 --> 00:22:37,378
I brought
my Breathe Right strips.

393
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:40,008
I would really, really insist
that we all have
our own rooms.

394
00:22:40,008 --> 00:22:43,641
Okay. You know what?
We'll find a bigger place.

395
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:46,814
I'm sure there's something
around here.
I mean it's easy.

396
00:22:46,814 --> 00:22:48,693
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-I'll pay for it.

397
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:50,780
You are the bride,
you're not paying a cent.

398
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,909
And by the way, Nico,
I'm still waiting
for that Venmo.

399
00:22:52,909 --> 00:22:54,788
Oh, I would,
but I only have two bars.

400
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:57,168
Okay. You know what?
Harrison can take my room

401
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,840
-and then I'll take the couch.
-No. I'll room with Harrison.

402
00:23:00,048 --> 00:23:01,594
I'm okay with it and so is he.

403
00:23:01,594 --> 00:23:03,388
Okay. No, uh, Harrison,

404
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:06,896
you will have your own room
and I will take that couch!

405
00:23:06,896 --> 00:23:08,440
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure!

406
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,360
I love this couch.
Look at this thing.

407
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:16,122
It is just the perfect couch
and I love it.

408
00:23:17,709 --> 00:23:19,963
God, what is that? Cotton?

409
00:23:24,890 --> 00:23:27,813
Okay. Well,
I brought the canvasses
and paint for wine and design

410
00:23:27,813 --> 00:23:30,192
and we still have
not yet wined nor designed.

411
00:23:30,192 --> 00:23:33,281
Oh, you know what?
Harrison and I,
are going to go upstairs

412
00:23:33,281 --> 00:23:34,618
and I'm going to show you
to your room

413
00:23:34,618 --> 00:23:36,831
and then, uh, you guys can,
uh, start on some cocktails.

414
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:38,626
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, I am-

415
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,295
Oh, I'm sorry. Beer.

416
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:41,464
I didn't get beer.

417
00:23:41,464 --> 00:23:45,180
Yep. We have Bellinis
or Appletinis
or Raspberrini-tinis.

418
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,517
-I'll take an Appletini.
-Okay.

419
00:23:46,517 --> 00:23:48,729
-Why don't you guys
go get some beer?
-No, I don't like the taste.

420
00:23:48,729 --> 00:23:50,274
-Okay. But for Harrison.
-Where?

421
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:52,988
-Where are we supposed to go?
-A store.

422
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:55,033
-Will Postmates deliver?
-Oh, now you have more
than two bars.

423
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:56,035
Oh no, it died.

424
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,541
-Oh,
I wouldn't mind a field trip.
-Great, awesome.

425
00:23:58,541 --> 00:24:00,545
Harrison, what kind of beer
do you like?

426
00:24:00,753 --> 00:24:01,755
I don't drink.

427
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:04,468
Okay.

428
00:24:04,553 --> 00:24:05,805
-Oh, right.
-Okay.

429
00:24:05,805 --> 00:24:08,686
That's cool.
I'm six years sober.
There's no shame in that.

430
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,982
Cool.

431
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:14,071
So why don't we, uh,
we're just... follow me.

432
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:16,159
Actually, you go first.

433
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:31,105
Got to say, really not cool
of Larry to spring this on me.

434
00:24:31,105 --> 00:24:33,068
-Oh relax. At least he's hot.
-I'm sorry,

435
00:24:33,068 --> 00:24:36,324
the crew cut, the camo,
what is he; a lesbian?

436
00:24:36,449 --> 00:24:37,619
I wonder
if he's killed anyone.

437
00:24:37,619 --> 00:24:39,372
I don't know,
lesbians are a gentle people.

438
00:24:39,372 --> 00:24:41,250
-He was wearing
an army costume.
-We just...

439
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,252
uniform.

440
00:24:43,506 --> 00:24:47,388
We just have to make sure
that our new lesbian friend
feels welcome. For Larry.

441
00:24:47,639 --> 00:24:48,724
Well what about the spirits?

442
00:24:48,808 --> 00:24:50,770
Nico, he just said
he doesn't drink.

443
00:24:50,853 --> 00:24:52,524
No. What if he is a spirit?

444
00:24:52,941 --> 00:24:56,322
What if the ghost of Phillip,
no, Sylvia, entered his body?

445
00:24:56,322 --> 00:25:00,414
Okay. The point is: None
of this was on the schedule.

446
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,838
I'm making
an Appletini, losers.

447
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,812
Mother!

448
00:25:34,983 --> 00:25:36,069
Is this what you want?

449
00:25:37,237 --> 00:25:38,364
For people to hear you?

450
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,492
To see your face?

451
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,705
No, I just...

452
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:42,707
No.

453
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,462
Keep it shut.

454
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,852
<i> Ah. </i>

455
00:25:53,854 --> 00:25:56,568
<i>So, uh, yeah, here it is.</i>
<i>Here it is.</i>

456
00:25:56,735 --> 00:25:59,490
Um, it's got your bed.
It's kind of cool.

457
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:01,662
Um, you got a window, dresser.

458
00:26:01,829 --> 00:26:05,377
It's... it's kind of got
like a, like a
pre-war charm to it actually.

459
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,172
All right, man.
I'll see you later.

460
00:26:07,214 --> 00:26:08,258
Oh, okay.

461
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:10,638
Um... I'm not going to lie.
I'm surprised you wanted to
come.

462
00:26:15,397 --> 00:26:16,692
Yeah. Jamie asked me to.

463
00:26:17,192 --> 00:26:18,571
Well, hopefully it could be...

464
00:26:19,948 --> 00:26:21,952
Um, I'm... I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry.

465
00:26:21,952 --> 00:26:25,000
I, I, I didn't know
that you were, uh...

466
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,755
can we drink around you?
Is it cool?

467
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:30,720
Reggie's cool with it,
but I know
everyone is different, so.

468
00:26:31,638 --> 00:26:32,891
Yeah man, you do you.

469
00:26:37,942 --> 00:26:38,944
Okay.

470
00:26:38,944 --> 00:26:42,785
A virgin cocktail
for our guest of honor.

471
00:26:42,911 --> 00:26:43,954
What's in it?

472
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:45,583
Oh, you know
a little bit of this,
a little bit of that,

473
00:26:45,583 --> 00:26:48,254
but if you mix it with love,
it's really going to...

474
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:50,258
is it good?

475
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,139
Straight people
have weaker palates,
genetically speaking.

476
00:26:55,185 --> 00:26:57,607
Uh, can I get you anything?

477
00:27:00,988 --> 00:27:03,702
Look, I know
my friends can be a lot,

478
00:27:03,702 --> 00:27:09,088
so I want to thank you
in advance for putting up
with their, uh, energy.

479
00:27:10,006 --> 00:27:11,008
A blonde chick.

480
00:27:12,219 --> 00:27:13,221
Who?

481
00:27:13,388 --> 00:27:15,350
<i>Oh my God!</i>
<i>You mean Nico.</i>

482
00:27:16,645 --> 00:27:17,939
<i>She comes on strong.</i>

483
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:21,153
Nico. Yeah.
I'll... I'll talk to him.

484
00:27:22,114 --> 00:27:23,116
He's a guy.

485
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:25,663
If you say so.

486
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,631
Have you ever seen
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?

487
00:27:32,384 --> 00:27:34,848
Miss Hepburn, ugh, heaven.

488
00:27:36,434 --> 00:27:40,860
Now I may not be some
fancy pants doctor
like Sidney Poitier

489
00:27:41,444 --> 00:27:44,701
but uh,
I... I do love your brother

490
00:27:45,703 --> 00:27:48,792
and I'd never hurt him.

491
00:27:55,848 --> 00:27:57,017
Gotta take a shit.

492
00:27:58,061 --> 00:27:59,063
Good. Good.

493
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,414
-<i>He didn't like it?<i>
-No.

494
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:10,210
-<i>Well then what does he like?</i>
-Pussy.

495
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:55,968
Nico.

496
00:28:56,093 --> 00:28:57,095
What?

497
00:28:58,014 --> 00:28:59,016
Bitch.

498
00:28:59,016 --> 00:29:00,477
I'm just waiting for our talk

499
00:29:01,145 --> 00:29:03,567
about me
needing to... tone it down.

500
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:07,115
-Oh God. I-
-My energy is a lot after all.

501
00:29:08,744 --> 00:29:10,371
You weren't supposed
to hear that,

502
00:29:10,789 --> 00:29:13,294
but not everyone can be
as big and bold as you.

503
00:29:13,461 --> 00:29:16,091
Ugh, you think that's big?

504
00:29:24,859 --> 00:29:26,988
I mean, I really thought
he was the one.

505
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:30,411
I mean his use of emoji,
you can't teach that.

506
00:29:30,411 --> 00:29:31,998
That was literally a virus.

507
00:29:35,088 --> 00:29:36,090
Sorry.

508
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:38,135
Sorry, I'm speaking
out of turn.

509
00:29:38,427 --> 00:29:40,473
He felt so real.

510
00:29:42,352 --> 00:29:44,314
But I liked
what Nico was saying though.

511
00:29:44,857 --> 00:29:47,153
You know, if we could
just kiss our friends,

512
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:51,203
even if it's only
on special occasions,
we wouldn't be so...

513
00:29:52,205 --> 00:29:53,207
alone.

514
00:29:56,673 --> 00:29:57,675
Yeah.

515
00:29:59,762 --> 00:30:01,307
Yeah, I don't... I don't,
I don't think that.

516
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:03,477
Yeah.
I know. I know.

517
00:30:04,313 --> 00:30:06,483
Besides, we're not,
we're not alone.

518
00:30:08,237 --> 00:30:09,782
Oh, you don't think that-?

519
00:30:11,995 --> 00:30:12,997
No, I don't.

520
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,802
So...

521
00:30:21,598 --> 00:30:22,683
it's just us then.

522
00:30:24,311 --> 00:30:25,313
-Oh God.
-No.

523
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:27,067
I'm sorry. Did, did I do that?
Let me...

524
00:30:27,067 --> 00:30:29,446
-No, it's fine.
- Hold on. Let me help you.
Let me help you. I just-

525
00:30:38,464 --> 00:30:40,343
♫<i>Oh, baby,<i>♫

526
00:30:40,844 --> 00:30:44,686
♫<i>See what you're doing<i>♫

527
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:46,690
♫<i>I'm gonna haunt you so<i>♫

528
00:30:46,815 --> 00:30:48,442
♫<i>I'm gonna taunt you so<i>♫

529
00:30:48,442 --> 00:30:51,156
♫<i>I'm going to drive you
to ruin<i>♫

530
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,622
Yes?

531
00:31:10,486 --> 00:31:12,073
Oh, okay.

532
00:31:13,075 --> 00:31:14,077
Are you lost?

533
00:31:14,829 --> 00:31:15,914
I heard singing.

534
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,335
What? Not your genre?

535
00:31:22,928 --> 00:31:23,930
Eww.

536
00:31:43,887 --> 00:31:44,889
Children?

537
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:49,524
<i>Children? </i>

538
00:31:54,282 --> 00:31:55,536
Hey buddy, what's good?

539
00:31:56,871 --> 00:31:58,040
You good my man?

540
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:01,046
Any ladies get your fancy?

541
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:03,635
Oh my God.
Fuck, this is hard.

542
00:32:05,137 --> 00:32:06,181
Hey buddy, you good?

543
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,893
-I'm chill.
-Oh.

544
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,312
Good.

545
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,358
Good, nice.

546
00:32:13,947 --> 00:32:17,245
Hey man, I been meaning to ask,
how... how's your speech
coming along?

547
00:32:18,623 --> 00:32:19,625
Speech?

548
00:32:20,376 --> 00:32:21,378
For the reception.

549
00:32:22,506 --> 00:32:24,467
It's always the best man
that gives a little speech.

550
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:26,639
You know...

551
00:32:27,223 --> 00:32:30,146
little dog and pony show,
maybe a roast,
maybe spoken word.

552
00:32:30,229 --> 00:32:31,481
Nobody told me this shit.

553
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:34,029
What do I, um...

554
00:32:36,158 --> 00:32:37,703
can you write it for me?

555
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:42,755
Oh, come on. I... I don't know
you and your brother's
inside jokes, your experience.

556
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,926
You don't want to know
about my experience.

557
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:51,981
I'm not good with, um...

558
00:32:53,108 --> 00:32:54,987
Words?
You're doing great, sweetie.

559
00:32:56,239 --> 00:32:57,241
What the fuck?

560
00:32:57,492 --> 00:32:59,245
Oh, I'm so sorry, man.

561
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,678
Where'd everybody else go?

562
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:09,892
Uh, I think
Reggie and Kevin are --
one second.

563
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:21,708
Bon appétit.

564
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,674
Ooh, did you want
to share my seat?

565
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:27,260
I'm good.

566
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,433
I... I don't mean share.
You can, you can have it.

567
00:33:32,061 --> 00:33:33,063
Where's the meat?

568
00:33:33,063 --> 00:33:34,775
Oh, I figured we can have
a light dinner tonight

569
00:33:34,775 --> 00:33:36,946
and then in the morning have
an even lighter breakfast.

570
00:33:36,946 --> 00:33:37,948
Let's order in.

571
00:33:37,948 --> 00:33:39,451
-What are you doing?
-I got it.

572
00:33:39,451 --> 00:33:40,954
-<i>You're not paying.<i>
-<i>It's fine.<i>

573
00:33:40,954 --> 00:33:41,956
Is there a Bennigan's?

574
00:33:41,956 --> 00:33:45,171
I would suggest something,
but I don't want
to come on too strong.

575
00:33:45,797 --> 00:33:46,924
Harrison?

576
00:33:48,511 --> 00:33:49,513
Harrison!

577
00:33:52,185 --> 00:33:53,187
Uh, pizza?

578
00:33:53,395 --> 00:33:55,609
-<i>Yes. Let's do that.<i>
-<i>Sure. Fine.<i>

579
00:33:55,609 --> 00:33:56,652
Ah, then it settled.

580
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:59,449
You guys
like thin crust, right,
you skinny faggots?

581
00:34:01,537 --> 00:34:02,581
We can say that now?

582
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,252
We can.

583
00:34:09,512 --> 00:34:10,764
<i>Careful darling. </i>

584
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:13,520
This one is sharp

585
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:17,193
designed to penetrate
with expedition,

586
00:34:20,282 --> 00:34:21,536
hardly any effort at all.

587
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:29,259
And this blade can glide
right through meat,

588
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:31,639
clean through the body.

589
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:38,903
How it must feel
to puncture flesh,

590
00:34:40,866 --> 00:34:42,285
to be executioner.

591
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:46,919
It's been years
since you made this.

592
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,592
Remember, Mother?

593
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,806
You'd call me in for supper

594
00:34:52,806 --> 00:34:56,313
and the smell
of garlic and tomatoes
would fill the house.

595
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,410
Teach me how to make it.

596
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:06,542
Could you do that for me?

597
00:35:06,584 --> 00:35:10,842
I will do what I must
to protect what is good

598
00:35:12,011 --> 00:35:13,806
and pure and right!

599
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,608
And when it is time,
I will not be afraid.

600
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:21,404
What will you do?

601
00:35:36,059 --> 00:35:37,144
What will you do?

602
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:39,190
Choreography.

603
00:35:39,525 --> 00:35:40,652
Finally. Yay.

604
00:35:40,652 --> 00:35:42,864
Wait, no,
I don't actually think
that that's--

605
00:35:42,864 --> 00:35:43,866
Wait, I haven't stretched.

606
00:35:43,866 --> 00:35:46,204
Oh, we'll start
with a vigorous
physical warm up.

607
00:35:46,204 --> 00:35:47,749
-I'll get the wigs.
-Oh, treat them with care.

608
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:50,672
-Oh Harrison, what are you?
Baritone, bass--
-No!

609
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,553
What the problem?

610
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:55,264
Oh, no. I'm sorry.
We're not going
to make you sing.

611
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,851
But what?
It's fine. It's silly.

612
00:35:56,892 --> 00:35:57,894
Fucking hell.

613
00:35:58,061 --> 00:35:59,773
What?
I'm just thinking
about our guest.

614
00:35:59,773 --> 00:36:01,736
Of course, our guest.

615
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:03,823
Well,
what do you think, Harrison?
We'd be learning--

616
00:36:03,823 --> 00:36:05,827
No! He is not interested.

617
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:08,583
He can speak for himself.
What kind of music
do you like?

618
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:18,101
This is good. I like this.
It's good.

619
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:23,529
Is that the Taj Mahal?

620
00:36:23,529 --> 00:36:25,157
I know,
where's the light source?

621
00:36:25,157 --> 00:36:26,619
The perspective's a disaster.

622
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:27,996
God, get it together, Kevin.

623
00:36:28,998 --> 00:36:30,627
Hey, I like yours.

624
00:36:30,668 --> 00:36:32,254
Oh thanks. It's my family.

625
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,133
Aww! Your mom's so pretty.

626
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:35,553
Thanks.

627
00:36:35,804 --> 00:36:36,889
Nico, let's see yours.

628
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:41,064
-Wow. It's uh--
-Abstract.

629
00:36:42,818 --> 00:36:43,820
It's abstract.

630
00:36:44,278 --> 00:36:47,869
Okay. Hey. Hey buddy.
Why don't you come
join us, buddy?

631
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:53,923
I'm sorry. I can't, sorry.

632
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:55,927
Migraine.

633
00:36:57,681 --> 00:36:59,434
Okay.
Uh, Never-Have-I-Ever, anyone?

634
00:36:59,434 --> 00:37:00,436
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.

635
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:02,231
-I always lose this game.
-All right. Clear the space.

636
00:37:02,231 --> 00:37:04,068
Believe it or not,
this was on the schedule
for tomorrow.

637
00:37:04,068 --> 00:37:05,446
Ah, great minds.

638
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:10,832
'Scuse me?

639
00:37:12,042 --> 00:37:13,044
What was that?

640
00:37:13,253 --> 00:37:16,384
It's probably just
a part of the package.
Just embrace it.

641
00:37:17,178 --> 00:37:18,430
I'm just gonna, just gimme a...

642
00:37:20,935 --> 00:37:23,064
Hi Frank, it's Reggie,
your weekend tenant.

643
00:37:23,064 --> 00:37:25,862
Uh, hi. I was just calling
about the banging
in the walls.

644
00:37:25,862 --> 00:37:28,618
I was wondering if that was
like one of those fun features

645
00:37:28,618 --> 00:37:30,538
or more of a structural issue.

646
00:37:30,538 --> 00:37:32,416
I look forward to getting
your call, or a text.

647
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,628
We love a text. Bye.

648
00:37:39,848 --> 00:37:42,394
All right, children, shall we?

649
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,650
Let's play.
10 fingers up, let me see 'em.

650
00:37:45,025 --> 00:37:46,027
I'll go first.

651
00:37:46,027 --> 00:37:50,202
Never have I ever
killed my son

652
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:52,958
and buried his body
on my estate.

653
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:55,045
-Never?
-I know. Surprising, right?

654
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:57,341
And I don't have an estate,
which is insane.

655
00:37:57,592 --> 00:37:58,719
-Reggie?
-I don't know.

656
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,974
-I always thought
I would have a daughter.
-Aww.

657
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,563
-Kevin?
-I buried
all my beanie babies once.

658
00:38:03,646 --> 00:38:04,648
Why?

659
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:05,984
They knew too much.

660
00:38:07,194 --> 00:38:09,950
What about you Harrison?
You ever kill
and bury your son?

661
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,626
It's funny.

662
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:16,296
Okay.

663
00:38:16,755 --> 00:38:18,926
Who's next?
And for real this time.

664
00:38:18,926 --> 00:38:21,515
-Okay. My turn.
Never have I ever--
-Kevin...

665
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:23,603
-why don't you go?
-Why don't I get to go?

666
00:38:23,603 --> 00:38:27,192
Because no one needs to hear
what little you haven't done
in a bathhouse.

667
00:38:27,192 --> 00:38:29,280
-And by no one, you mean--
-Kevin! Yes.

668
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,619
Um, um, um, never have I ever

669
00:38:32,244 --> 00:38:38,131
hooked up with a guy
on the kitchen floor
of a creepy old house

670
00:38:39,676 --> 00:38:40,678
'til today.

671
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:42,473
-What?
-Kevin!

672
00:38:42,473 --> 00:38:45,855
-I fucking knew it.
-Oh no.
That is not how you play.

673
00:38:45,855 --> 00:38:48,276
-Well then how do you play?
-This happened when?

674
00:38:48,276 --> 00:38:50,948
I knew you all were
in that kitchen for too long!

675
00:38:50,948 --> 00:38:52,661
Let's not make
a big thing about--

676
00:38:52,661 --> 00:38:55,583
You whores!
This is my bachelor party.

677
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:56,919
Hold up. They did what?

678
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,673
Yeah.
My thoughts exactly, Harrison.

679
00:38:58,673 --> 00:39:01,720
Wait, first off,
how long
has this been happening?

680
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,806
This was the first time.

681
00:39:02,806 --> 00:39:04,392
Yeah. I've never even looked
at him in that way.

682
00:39:04,392 --> 00:39:06,605
Not that he isn’t,
not that you...
you are adorable.

683
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:09,068
You are too.
My mom is going to flip.

684
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:14,621
-You like that, Harrison?
-It's pretty funny.

685
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,461
It is funny.

686
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:20,800
Oh, wait. Oh my God.

687
00:39:21,426 --> 00:39:24,558
You all hooked up
while making the sandwiches?

688
00:39:24,725 --> 00:39:25,727
What?

689
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:27,229
-Yeah, but the sandwiches
were sanitary.
-We swear.

690
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,649
And on the floor?

691
00:39:28,816 --> 00:39:31,947
The splinters, oh my God.
But you know what...

692
00:39:32,615 --> 00:39:35,328
-you two, this is so--
-Disgusting.

693
00:39:47,186 --> 00:39:49,106
Um, cute.

694
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:52,196
I was going to say cute.
You guys are cute.

695
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:53,991
-What did you just say?
-What?

696
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,538
He didn't mean that.
You didn't mean that, right?

697
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,916
Why are you defending him?

698
00:39:57,916 --> 00:39:59,251
You guys were laughing too.

699
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:02,257
-You know what, I'm going to--
-No wait, don't go.

700
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,602
Um.

701
00:40:07,644 --> 00:40:08,646
What the-?

702
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:10,398
What just happened?

703
00:40:11,067 --> 00:40:12,069
I can't see.

704
00:40:13,906 --> 00:40:15,952
- Where's the fuse box?
- I don't know.

705
00:40:15,952 --> 00:40:17,831
-It's a rental!
-Will somebody
get their phone?

706
00:40:17,831 --> 00:40:18,874
Oh, I have it here.

707
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,628
-I thought your phone died.
-Oh it did.

708
00:40:21,964 --> 00:40:23,466
-This is it.
-Okay, everyone...

709
00:40:23,466 --> 00:40:25,387
just says stay calm.
I'm sure
that there's a explanation--

710
00:40:25,387 --> 00:40:26,849
There's so much
I haven't done!

711
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:28,769
-Who is touching me?
-Not fucking me!

712
00:40:28,769 --> 00:40:30,021
No one thought
it was fucking you!

713
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,652
Nobody move.

714
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:43,006
Oh my God.

715
00:40:43,172 --> 00:40:44,174
Did you hear that?

716
00:40:44,926 --> 00:40:46,137
Where is it coming from?

717
00:40:52,357 --> 00:40:54,403
Oh! It worked.

718
00:40:54,486 --> 00:40:55,488
What worked?

719
00:40:55,907 --> 00:41:00,248
Um, we had a séance
before you came here.

720
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,503
It was, it was nothing.
Really, it was silly.

721
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:18,201
Maybe it was a mouse.

722
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:21,457
Okay, maybe several mice.

723
00:41:25,173 --> 00:41:26,467
Hi Frank. It's Reggie.

724
00:41:26,467 --> 00:41:29,014
I was just wondering if maybe
we were surrounded
by demonic forces

725
00:41:29,014 --> 00:41:30,768
or in possible
need of some maintenance.

726
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:32,437
Please give me a call back
as soon as you can.

727
00:41:32,437 --> 00:41:35,653
I hope you're having
a wonderful evening
surrounded by loved ones.

728
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:38,032
Sylvia?

729
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:39,786
-Phillip?
-Don't!

730
00:41:41,497 --> 00:41:44,169
-Is this what you guys do?
You fuck around with demons?
-No!

731
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:46,465
-Phillip is not a demon.
-I mean, Sylvia,
we're still unclear.

732
00:41:46,465 --> 00:41:47,969
You put
some kind of curse on me?

733
00:41:47,969 --> 00:41:49,723
-Oh, on you. Oh honey.
-Are you serious?

734
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:50,808
We didn't think it would work.

735
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:53,104
Nothing worked!
We're getting ahead
of ourselves.

736
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:56,737
Um, all signs point to,
I'm a witch.

737
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,406
I think... they're here.

738
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:00,243
Okay. For argument sake,

739
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:02,456
let's just say we summoned
a murderous ghost

740
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:04,001
with a pale son.
If we summoned her,

741
00:42:04,001 --> 00:42:05,504
then we can
exorcise her, right?

742
00:42:05,504 --> 00:42:06,757
Well but she just got here.

743
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:08,259
And now she needs to leave!

744
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,973
Come on, there must be
something in your book
about reversing it!

745
00:42:10,973 --> 00:42:12,685
-Go get it!
-What if she gets mad?

746
00:42:12,685 --> 00:42:14,271
-Who?
-Sylvia!

747
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:16,150
-Fuck this, I'm out of here.
Wait!

748
00:42:16,275 --> 00:42:17,779
If he wants to leave
then let him leave.

749
00:42:17,779 --> 00:42:19,364
Wait,
you don't have your stuff.

750
00:42:20,826 --> 00:42:22,705
-Get your bag, Larry.
-<i>What? Me?<i>

751
00:42:23,665 --> 00:42:26,170
Let's move.
I'm not going to get blamed
for leaving you here alone.

752
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:27,214
He's not alone.

753
00:42:27,297 --> 00:42:29,677
Harrison, bruh,
you don't have to be scared.

754
00:42:29,677 --> 00:42:30,679
I'm not.

755
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,683
Turns out there's
a bunch of gay guys here
who aren't.

756
00:42:32,683 --> 00:42:34,604
Would somebody
shut this guy up
before I knock him out?

757
00:42:34,604 --> 00:42:38,319
Okay. Well, you know what?
Guys, all we have to do
is calm down,

758
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:41,535
take a breather,
and exorcise the evil spirits
from this house.

759
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,537
What?

760
00:42:42,537 --> 00:42:43,705
What happened to sitting down
with Ms. Lawrence

761
00:42:43,705 --> 00:42:45,041
and finding out
why she murdered her kid?

762
00:42:45,041 --> 00:42:46,377
-Who?
-I'm not finished.

763
00:42:46,377 --> 00:42:48,966
And what is the point
of booking a haunted house?

764
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,721
-This place is haunted?
-I'm speaking? I'm speaking.

765
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:53,934
Can't we just ask Sylvia
a few questions?

766
00:42:53,934 --> 00:42:55,228
-Like what?
-Why did you do it?

767
00:42:55,228 --> 00:42:56,731
Where is he buried?
Who are you wearing?

768
00:42:56,731 --> 00:42:57,733
Was there a husband?

769
00:42:57,733 --> 00:42:59,153
I mean, she seems more
like a widow to me.

770
00:42:59,153 --> 00:43:00,363
But what if
she killed him too?

771
00:43:00,363 --> 00:43:01,365
Let's let her bring that up.

772
00:43:01,365 --> 00:43:02,367
Hey!

773
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:04,204
What the fuck is this?

774
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:12,262
Someone's fucking with me
and it's not funny.

775
00:43:12,262 --> 00:43:13,264
What happened?

776
00:43:13,264 --> 00:43:15,476
I said I don't drink.
Look at my cup.

777
00:43:15,936 --> 00:43:19,569
I, I, I'm sure
it was an accident.

778
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:22,032
-Nobody filled up your glass.
-Someone did.

779
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:23,952
-Oh, Sylvia...
-And I know it was you.

780
00:43:23,952 --> 00:43:25,581
Uh, Nico wouldn't have
done that.

781
00:43:25,581 --> 00:43:27,125
Okay. Do you have
a sponsor that you could call?

782
00:43:27,125 --> 00:43:29,004
-What?
You're part
of The Program, right?

783
00:43:29,004 --> 00:43:30,256
-So you have some--
-I don't do that shit.

784
00:43:30,256 --> 00:43:31,467
Okay. Okay. Alright.

785
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:34,014
Well, if this
is triggering for you,
which it's okay

786
00:43:34,014 --> 00:43:36,268
if it is, just give me
the glass
and I'll pour it out,

787
00:43:36,268 --> 00:43:37,270
no worries.

788
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:41,655
Don't waste it.
Larry, come get your hetero.

789
00:43:41,738 --> 00:43:42,990
Okay. You're not helping.

790
00:43:42,990 --> 00:43:45,078
The second
those lights went out,
you grabbed that bottle.

791
00:43:45,078 --> 00:43:46,497
First chance you got
to screw with me.

792
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:47,917
What is your problem?

793
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,169
I... I mean, did you?

794
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:51,048
What?

795
00:43:51,048 --> 00:43:52,635
I... I mean,
you've had it out for him since...

796
00:43:52,635 --> 00:43:54,012
Oh, I've had it out for him?!

797
00:43:54,221 --> 00:43:55,683
Okay. Can we just table this?

798
00:43:55,683 --> 00:43:58,939
-I mean,
we have an exorcism to do.
-Good call.

799
00:43:58,939 --> 00:44:00,985
<i>Uh, Sylvia! Can you hear us?</i>

800
00:44:00,985 --> 00:44:02,404
Yeah.
Make yourself known, girl!

801
00:44:02,404 --> 00:44:05,326
Yeah. We just want to talk.
I'm sure
you have some stories!

802
00:44:05,326 --> 00:44:07,707
From the moment
I walked in here I knew
you were bad fucking news.

803
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:09,794
-Same girl.
-Hey, don't call me that.

804
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:10,879
Okay. Can we please?

805
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,717
You wanted me to get drunk
and lose control.

806
00:44:12,717 --> 00:44:14,762
-Say it. You wanted to--
-Have my way with you?

807
00:44:14,762 --> 00:44:16,473
Take advantage of you?

808
00:44:16,516 --> 00:44:18,394
-Hey, you're sick.
-Hey, both of you, stop it.

809
00:44:18,394 --> 00:44:21,108
You know what, if I were
going to hit
on a straight guy,

810
00:44:21,108 --> 00:44:23,655
I wouldn't pick one
with such
a shitty personality.

811
00:44:23,655 --> 00:44:26,035
Someone wants to die tonight!

812
00:44:26,786 --> 00:44:28,749
-What are you doing?
-It's a distraction, go with it.

813
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:29,792
Get off of me!

814
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:34,510
Hey, fuck it.

815
00:44:35,053 --> 00:44:36,765
Spirit's got nothing
on drunk me.

816
00:44:37,683 --> 00:44:39,353
No, no, no.
What are you doing?

817
00:44:48,037 --> 00:44:49,749
Let's party bitch. Hmm?

818
00:44:50,333 --> 00:44:51,335
Bottoms up.

819
00:44:53,548 --> 00:44:57,515
Oh my God. Oh Jamie...
Jamie. Oh my God.

820
00:44:57,515 --> 00:44:59,519
-Okay.
-And we're going down.

821
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,896
-Okay, Kevin,
go get some water.
-Okay.

822
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:04,361
-Here. Here.
-Oh, Nico's got it.
Nico got the water.

823
00:45:04,361 --> 00:45:05,781
Okay, Larry,
are you drinking the water?

824
00:45:05,781 --> 00:45:07,409
Do you need help
drinking the water
because I can--

825
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:08,620
Give him space please,
three feet, all right.

826
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,582
Hey look, you're good.
It's all good.

827
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:11,918
Why did I
have to marry a white boy?

828
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:12,920
You see, this is what happens.

829
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,464
-You love Jamie.
-He's fine.

830
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,427
-You love Jamie.
-Leave me alone!
-Oh.

831
00:45:16,803 --> 00:45:18,472
Okay. All right,
this is what
we're going to do.

832
00:45:18,472 --> 00:45:20,894
Listen up. We are going
to figure out a way
to reverse this shit

833
00:45:20,894 --> 00:45:22,773
and get these spirits back
to where they came from. Yes?

834
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:23,775
-Yes.
-Understood?

835
00:45:24,944 --> 00:45:26,196
-Nico?
-Mm-hmm.

836
00:45:26,238 --> 00:45:28,743
-All right. Good.
Go get your book.
-Jamie's going to--

837
00:45:28,743 --> 00:45:31,457
Jamie.... Jamie has no idea
what's even going on.

838
00:45:31,457 --> 00:45:32,668
Hey, and Harrison
can sleep it off.

839
00:45:32,668 --> 00:45:35,339
Don't even worry about Jamie.
He's probably
not even thinking about us.

840
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,135
Oh.

841
00:45:37,385 --> 00:45:38,847
-Hi Jamie. It's Reggie.
-<i>Reggie.<i>

842
00:45:38,847 --> 00:45:40,976
I love hearing your voice.
You love hearing mine.

843
00:45:40,976 --> 00:45:42,730
Listen,
everything is great over here.

844
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:43,773
Don't worry about anything.

845
00:45:43,773 --> 00:45:46,320
Your brother just screamed
at us and drank
an entire bottle of wine.

846
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:48,658
-We have it all under control.
-<i>Do you mean Harrison?<i>

847
00:45:48,658 --> 00:45:49,869
-Yeah. Don't worry about it.
-<i>Larry?<i>

848
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:51,038
Okay.
We're going to order pizza.

849
00:45:51,038 --> 00:45:52,750
-<i>Where is Larry?<i>
All right. Blessings to you
and yours. Bye-bye.

850
00:46:10,284 --> 00:46:12,706
Hey. Hi. How are you?
Sorry about that, it's really,

851
00:46:12,706 --> 00:46:15,587
-everything is fine.
We're having--
--Stop talking.

852
00:46:15,754 --> 00:46:16,965
-Did he really drink?
-Yes.

853
00:46:16,965 --> 00:46:19,010
But it was just a few sips
followed by several more sips.

854
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,766
-I'm driving up.
-No, no, I can handle this.

855
00:46:23,853 --> 00:46:26,985
-Find the spell.
-Oh, relax. She's probably
already gone by now.

856
00:46:34,457 --> 00:46:35,794
Find the spell.

857
00:46:40,303 --> 00:46:41,305
You don't know my brother.

858
00:46:41,346 --> 00:46:44,060
You got to have
your bachelor party,
so let me have mine.

859
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:46,273
I know.
It's just that in the past...

860
00:46:47,275 --> 00:46:51,618
there have been times
when he has gotten... violent.

861
00:46:52,703 --> 00:46:54,372
Hasn't happened
in a while, but...

862
00:46:54,832 --> 00:46:57,295
Wow. Great.
Thanks for inviting him.

863
00:46:57,295 --> 00:46:59,132
-You invited him!
-You made me invite him!

864
00:46:59,132 --> 00:47:02,221
It was your idea!
Okay. Okay. I'm on my way.

865
00:47:02,305 --> 00:47:04,434
Is that really necessary?

866
00:47:04,476 --> 00:47:05,478
<i>Yes. </i>

867
00:47:05,687 --> 00:47:06,773
Keep an eye on him

868
00:47:06,773 --> 00:47:10,739
and just make sure
that you hide anything that
could be used as a potential--

869
00:47:13,536 --> 00:47:16,291
So we have Sylvia's gloves,
but we still need to find
something of Phillip's.

870
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,379
Okay. Well, how are we
supposed to know
what belongs to him?

871
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:20,926
-Just use your intuition.
-You don't have to be
rude about it.

872
00:47:20,926 --> 00:47:22,220
There is no time for nice.

873
00:47:23,013 --> 00:47:24,182
Okay. Uh...

874
00:47:25,476 --> 00:47:27,564
Pants. Will these work?

875
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:30,779
-Are they Phillip's?
-I don't know.
I like the pleats.

876
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:33,952
While you're in there,
find me a shawl.
Something with drama.

877
00:47:33,952 --> 00:47:34,954
Focus.

878
00:47:41,007 --> 00:47:42,093
Knock, knock.

879
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,377
What boo, are you okay?

880
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:02,551
Oh my...

881
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:30,816
I'm just so happy for them.

882
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:32,528
What don't
you understand here?

883
00:48:32,528 --> 00:48:35,282
Sylvia found that photo
and that's all
she needed to see.

884
00:48:35,282 --> 00:48:37,704
-Diva was hateful.
-What about the other boy?

885
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:39,123
She probably killed him too.

886
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:43,131
I imagine she walked in
on them doing the deed
and lost her fucking mind.

887
00:48:43,131 --> 00:48:44,300
And that still wasn't enough.

888
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,098
There are four
magnificent queens
in this house

889
00:48:48,016 --> 00:48:49,394
and she's not done yet.

890
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,562
<i>I knew it.</i>

891
00:49:10,604 --> 00:49:11,606
<i>You knew nothing.</i>

892
00:49:11,647 --> 00:49:12,649
<i>I felt it.</i>

893
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:15,446
- <i>Okay.
<i>- <i>Let's just not jump</i>
<i>to conclusions.</i>

894
00:49:15,446 --> 00:49:18,201
<i>He is gay.</i>
<i>As gay as you and me,</i>
<i>almost as gay as Nico.</i>

895
00:49:18,452 --> 00:49:19,997
<i>Impossible.</i>
<i>Just look at him.</i>

896
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:21,542
<i>Okay. Okay.</i>

897
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:25,508
<i>The moment I looked</i>
<i>into those faggoty eyes,</i>
<i>I knew.</i>

898
00:49:31,436 --> 00:49:32,773
-It's her.
-Here we go.

899
00:49:32,773 --> 00:49:33,900
Shit, shit, shit.

900
00:49:34,484 --> 00:49:35,987
-It's stuck!
-No, no!

901
00:49:36,112 --> 00:49:37,239
Let me think.

902
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:39,536
Does anyone have
their phone on them?
Mine's dead.

903
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:41,206
Aren't you seriously
still committing to that bit?

904
00:49:41,206 --> 00:49:42,626
Oh God.
Mine's on the kitchen counter.

905
00:49:42,626 --> 00:49:44,588
Just serves me right
for trying to be in the "now."

906
00:49:44,588 --> 00:49:47,093
-Kevin, please shut up.
-Larry!

907
00:49:49,263 --> 00:49:51,978
-Hey Larry!
-Larry! Larry!
-Larry!

908
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,922
What are you doing down here?

909
00:50:06,632 --> 00:50:08,176
I've never been so happy
to see you.

910
00:50:08,176 --> 00:50:10,014
-Did you see Harrison?
-Did you see Sylvia?

911
00:50:10,014 --> 00:50:11,851
No. Wait,
we do not have time for this.
Listen.

912
00:50:11,851 --> 00:50:13,855
-No, you listen.
Phillip's a homo.
-What?

913
00:50:13,896 --> 00:50:15,942
Or bisexual, which is
legitimate and beautiful.

914
00:50:15,942 --> 00:50:17,111
-See for yourself.
-Yes.

915
00:50:17,486 --> 00:50:18,990
That's why Sylvia killed him.

916
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:21,579
-And now she's after us.
-And she's being very rude.

917
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,123
Okay. I'm ready.
Let's do the spell.

918
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:24,042
We have all this stuff, right?

919
00:50:24,042 --> 00:50:25,294
Wait,
we have to find Harrison.

920
00:50:25,377 --> 00:50:27,799
-Literally,
who cares about him?
-He has a knife.

921
00:50:34,145 --> 00:50:35,774
Make him feel welcome,
they said.

922
00:50:50,177 --> 00:50:52,264
-Like why are you--?
-Shh.

923
00:50:52,264 --> 00:50:54,393
-I'm just saying, if he's
in the house, shouldn't we--
-Be fucking quiet!

924
00:50:54,603 --> 00:50:56,649
Shut up.
Shut the fuck up.

925
00:50:58,068 --> 00:50:59,362
Why are you being so mean?

926
00:50:59,863 --> 00:51:01,742
Because
you're going to get us killed.

927
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,374
Look,
if you want to go out there,
be my guest.

928
00:51:06,459 --> 00:51:08,506
Now I get
why they say you shouldn’t
kiss your friends.

929
00:51:12,179 --> 00:51:13,390
Where are you going?

930
00:51:20,613 --> 00:51:21,615
Kevin?

931
00:51:39,651 --> 00:51:40,653
Harrison?

932
00:51:45,914 --> 00:51:46,916
Fuck!

933
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,586
Hello?

934
00:52:13,051 --> 00:52:15,138
Uh, delivery.

935
00:52:18,896 --> 00:52:22,821
Got your meatless
pepperoni,
gluten-free vegan cheese.

936
00:52:24,365 --> 00:52:25,367
Hello?

937
00:52:32,131 --> 00:52:33,133
It's you.

938
00:52:35,137 --> 00:52:37,642
-Uh.
-I've been expecting you.

939
00:52:39,145 --> 00:52:40,147
Well, yeah.

940
00:52:41,482 --> 00:52:46,451
So lifelike, so innocent,

941
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:49,833
tragic, but beautiful.

942
00:52:51,419 --> 00:52:52,421
Thanks.

943
00:52:53,716 --> 00:52:57,515
And who hasn't, in a sense,
been victim to our mothers.

944
00:52:59,603 --> 00:53:00,605
How'd you know?

945
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:05,113
What can I say?
We did a little digging
and uh, we know your secret.

946
00:53:06,533 --> 00:53:07,535
My secret?

947
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,583
You don't have
to hide anymore.

948
00:53:11,501 --> 00:53:15,676
Look at me,
now we love in the open.

949
00:53:17,931 --> 00:53:21,730
Oh. Okay. Wow.

950
00:53:22,774 --> 00:53:26,865
Shh. We don't have much time.
I see you, I get you,

951
00:53:27,617 --> 00:53:31,332
and I am going
to set you free.

952
00:53:35,257 --> 00:53:37,929
Oh, it feels so real!

953
00:53:43,106 --> 00:53:44,108
Ooh!

954
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,269
Harrison. You in here?

955
00:54:07,697 --> 00:54:09,659
What's good, my man?

956
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:16,673
You, uh, you chilling?

957
00:54:21,474 --> 00:54:24,188
Harrison, I--I know
you might be angry,

958
00:54:24,856 --> 00:54:27,069
maybe even a little sloshed,
and that's okay.

959
00:54:28,112 --> 00:54:32,622
I mean, I just need to know
that you're okay,
because we're brothers, right?

960
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:36,462
And you don't even
have to talk.

961
00:54:36,462 --> 00:54:38,884
I mean, I--
We can even watch
a sports game.

962
00:54:40,095 --> 00:54:42,600
Yeah.
Why don't we do that?

963
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:45,146
Why don't we watch... Sports?

964
00:55:18,631 --> 00:55:20,425
Hey Frank,
we certainly seem to have

965
00:55:20,425 --> 00:55:22,346
summoned some
suspicious spirits.

966
00:55:22,346 --> 00:55:26,730
Uh, sooo if you could
please advise us on how
to proceed with that.

967
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,942
I will leave
a glowing review
on your website.

968
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:30,821
Um, okay.
Blessings to you and yours.

969
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,032
Okay. Bye-bye.

970
00:55:36,457 --> 00:55:40,675
Harrison,
no one is going to hurt you.
Okay?

971
00:55:42,177 --> 00:55:43,304
Okay.
We would never do that.

972
00:55:43,681 --> 00:55:46,687
Let's just get your stuff
and get out of here
before Sylvia,

973
00:55:46,853 --> 00:55:48,524
or anything bad happens.

974
00:56:13,574 --> 00:56:17,790
Oh fuck.
What the fuck.
Oh my God.

975
00:56:23,552 --> 00:56:27,142
-Oh, are you okay?
I'm so sorry, I didn't-!
-Ow!

976
00:56:47,224 --> 00:56:48,226
Hey!

977
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,761
-Careful.
-My God. He's fine.

978
00:57:05,761 --> 00:57:07,557
Yeah,
I'm so, so, so, so, so sorry.

979
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,602
-What happened?
-I couldn't see anything
and I just-.

980
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:11,438
Okay.
We need to hurry up
and do the spell.

981
00:57:11,438 --> 00:57:13,527
-Your best man
was almost killed.
-By you.

982
00:57:13,569 --> 00:57:15,656
-It was an accident.
-You did this to me?

983
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:17,827
Okay.
The sooner that we exorcise
her from this house,

984
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,037
the sooner
that this is all over.

985
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:20,708
I mean, look at
what you did to Harrison.

986
00:57:21,458 --> 00:57:22,545
What are you even saying?

987
00:57:22,545 --> 00:57:25,801
Going after Nico with a knife,
Harrison would never do that.

988
00:57:25,843 --> 00:57:29,224
-He just did.
-No, clearly
he is possessed by Sylvia.

989
00:57:29,224 --> 00:57:32,063
You have got to stop
making excuses for him.

990
00:57:32,314 --> 00:57:33,525
-He's right.
-Thank you.

991
00:57:33,692 --> 00:57:34,986
No, Larry's right.

992
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,823
She's in there.
She saw me with Phillip.

993
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,411
-What?
-Was I passed out
for the Phillip part?

994
00:57:39,453 --> 00:57:40,748
No, none of you were there.

995
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,587
Okay. Look, Sylvia attacked me
because I fucked her son.

996
00:57:44,797 --> 00:57:46,718
Bitch, no.

997
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:49,181
So what, I fucked a ghost.
No big deal.

998
00:57:50,768 --> 00:57:52,437
It wouldn't be the first time.
It's not going to be my last.

999
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:54,776
-Did it hurt?
-Yeah I'm gonna need
a play by play.

1000
00:57:54,776 --> 00:57:55,903
No, it was exactly
what you'd think.

1001
00:57:55,903 --> 00:57:57,865
I mean, he was soft.
He smelled like bread...

1002
00:57:57,865 --> 00:57:59,242
-Does the boyfriend know?
-Who?

1003
00:57:59,284 --> 00:58:00,913
You know,
the one in the picture.

1004
00:58:01,163 --> 00:58:03,125
Just what we need.
Another angry ghost.

1005
00:58:03,167 --> 00:58:04,796
Look, we don't know
their arrangement.

1006
00:58:04,837 --> 00:58:08,512
Anyway, the moment his icy hands
touched my living flesh--

1007
00:58:08,595 --> 00:58:10,891
Children! Details later.

1008
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:13,145
Right now
we have an exorcism to do.

1009
00:58:17,195 --> 00:58:18,782
Bring me the objects.

1010
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:24,334
Something of hers.
Something of his.

1011
00:58:34,396 --> 00:58:36,526
-Oh my gosh.
Should we wake him?
-Why would we do that?

1012
00:58:36,651 --> 00:58:37,945
I like him better
when he is sleeping.

1013
00:58:37,987 --> 00:58:39,824
Okay.
Harrison is in there somewhere

1014
00:58:39,824 --> 00:58:41,911
and he needs our help.
If we wake him--

1015
00:58:41,911 --> 00:58:44,458
Then Sylvia attacks us
all over again.

1016
00:58:44,959 --> 00:58:47,297
The host body is unconscious.

1017
00:58:47,380 --> 00:58:48,884
Let us leave it that way.

1018
00:58:49,677 --> 00:58:50,721
Hands.

1019
00:58:53,142 --> 00:58:57,108
Spirit or devil
or demon or god,

1020
00:58:57,484 --> 00:59:00,364
cease your possession
and evil façade.

1021
00:59:03,914 --> 00:59:06,293
Into our house may
you enter no more.

1022
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:09,592
We banish your mischief
and waging of war.

1023
00:59:15,394 --> 00:59:18,860
This host shall not be
penetrated by your pagan plot.

1024
00:59:19,236 --> 00:59:23,202
Abdicate this vessel
should his goodness start
to rot.

1025
00:59:24,454 --> 00:59:25,749
-What Goodness?
-Hey!

1026
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:27,753
It won't work
if you keep adding
your commentary.

1027
00:59:27,753 --> 00:59:28,755
Okay.
But what if it doesn't work

1028
00:59:28,755 --> 00:59:30,174
because
there's no goodness to save?

1029
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:33,430
Be gone, be exiled
as we chant our spell.

1030
00:59:33,430 --> 00:59:38,357
-Be gone. Be-
-Fuck me.

1031
00:59:38,357 --> 00:59:39,986
Oh my God.
He's awake. Harrison!

1032
00:59:39,986 --> 00:59:41,698
-Wait, be careful.
-Do not untie him.

1033
00:59:41,698 --> 00:59:44,996
-People, we are mid-exorcism.
-Hey, my dude.

1034
00:59:44,996 --> 00:59:47,333
-What did you do to me?
-It was for your own safety.

1035
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,296
Yeah, you tried to kill our
friend so we restrained you.

1036
00:59:49,296 --> 00:59:51,091
To be clear,
Sylvia entered your body

1037
00:59:51,091 --> 00:59:53,262
and she tried to kill me
because I bottomed
for her son.

1038
00:59:53,262 --> 00:59:54,682
Oh, don't scare him!

1039
00:59:55,266 --> 00:59:58,105
Fine, I topped her son.
Now if we can resume.

1040
00:59:58,397 --> 00:59:59,901
Do you,
do you need some water?

1041
01:00:00,109 --> 01:00:01,361
-Seriously?
-Get me...

1042
01:00:01,988 --> 01:00:04,535
-Yeah buddy.
-Sit down.
We need to finish this.

1043
01:00:04,535 --> 01:00:07,248
-We can't just
leave him here like this!
-Get me...

1044
01:00:07,248 --> 01:00:10,631
-Whatever you need,
just tell me.
-Sit down.

1045
01:00:10,631 --> 01:00:13,511
-Nico is right. Come on.
-You get me the
fuck out of here!

1046
01:00:13,553 --> 01:00:16,809
-Shut up Sylvia,
we're working on it.

1047
01:00:19,481 --> 01:00:20,483
Read!

1048
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:31,088
Be gone, be exiled
as we chant our spell,

1049
01:00:31,338 --> 01:00:34,219
relinquishing our innocence,
you succubus from hell.

1050
01:00:35,388 --> 01:00:36,766
Oh, hush woman!

1051
01:00:37,685 --> 01:00:39,145
Now all together.

1052
01:00:39,939 --> 01:00:42,820
Exorcizamus Te
immundus spiritum.

1053
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,991
Exorcizamus to the,
to the what?

1054
01:00:44,991 --> 01:00:47,955
Exorcizamus Te
immundus spiritum.

1055
01:00:49,291 --> 01:00:53,048
Exorcizamus Te
immundus spiritum.

1056
01:00:53,299 --> 01:00:56,179
Exorcizamus Te
immundus spiritum.

1057
01:00:56,430 --> 01:00:58,518
Exorcizamus Te
immundus spiritum.

1058
01:00:58,685 --> 01:01:00,689
Exorcizamus Te
immundus spiritum.

1059
01:01:00,939 --> 01:01:02,901
Exorcizamus Te
immundus spiritum.

1060
01:01:03,068 --> 01:01:05,741
No. No. No. No.

1061
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:08,495
What are you doing?
You'll get us all killed.

1062
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:12,420
Stop!

1063
01:01:15,051 --> 01:01:16,053
Look.

1064
01:01:21,188 --> 01:01:22,900
Guys, look at this right here.

1065
01:01:25,614 --> 01:01:29,955
-You're scaring me.
-Soon you'll be free of pain.

1066
01:01:40,434 --> 01:01:42,105
"My son and his heart."

1067
01:01:45,236 --> 01:01:46,488
I'll be right behind you.

1068
01:01:49,035 --> 01:01:50,580
-If I lose my way?
-You won't.

1069
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:52,960
It's her handwriting.

1070
01:01:55,882 --> 01:01:58,178
-And if they find me?
-I won't let them.

1071
01:02:03,982 --> 01:02:07,029
You remember what I told you?
It's two miles north of here.

1072
01:02:07,405 --> 01:02:09,367
And if I see the river,
I've traveled too far.

1073
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:11,204
When you reach the house,
go into the cellar,

1074
01:02:11,204 --> 01:02:12,457
there are blankets
and there's food.

1075
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,335
And Simon?

1076
01:02:17,926 --> 01:02:20,055
I have to find him.
We have to warn him.

1077
01:02:20,264 --> 01:02:21,809
And let them catch you?

1078
01:02:22,561 --> 01:02:25,107
No, you must leave, now.

1079
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:28,615
-I'll tell the others
you’ve run away.
-No, tell them we're dead.

1080
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,829
Tell them that you buried me
in the forest, Simon too.

1081
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:39,720
In due time
I'll slip out.

1082
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:41,431
And find Simon.

1083
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,395
-And then the three of us,
we can all be--
- Run.

1084
01:02:45,105 --> 01:02:47,318
Go, out the back.

1085
01:02:53,623 --> 01:02:55,042
But why'd they kill her?

1086
01:02:57,129 --> 01:02:59,300
He's gone.
You'll never find him.

1087
01:03:02,014 --> 01:03:04,227
He's dead.
Buried in the woods.

1088
01:03:04,603 --> 01:03:07,483
Now get out,
get out of my house!

1089
01:03:09,655 --> 01:03:13,746
-Because she kept their secret.
-Sylvia.

1090
01:03:14,205 --> 01:03:15,291
She's not evil.

1091
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,128
Is she even here?

1092
01:03:35,372 --> 01:03:37,209
Oh, sorry. Tricky harmony.

1093
01:03:38,713 --> 01:03:40,967
-What the fuck!
-It was you?

1094
01:03:40,967 --> 01:03:42,888
What?
I just wanted to nail it
by showtime.

1095
01:03:43,598 --> 01:03:46,227
That's not even close
to what we taught you.

1096
01:03:46,394 --> 01:03:47,773
Then we're using the track.

1097
01:03:48,106 --> 01:03:49,943
-I am so sorry.
-No, I'm sorry.

1098
01:03:49,943 --> 01:03:51,989
-I was awful to you.
-I almost killed you.

1099
01:03:51,989 --> 01:03:53,618
It was an accident.
I know it was an accident.

1100
01:03:56,916 --> 01:04:00,214
-Sylvia,
why are you doing this?
-I'm not Sylvia!

1101
01:04:00,507 --> 01:04:04,013
-Exactly what she would say.
-Harrison, put,
put the knife down.

1102
01:04:04,013 --> 01:04:05,015
Stay back.

1103
01:04:05,015 --> 01:04:06,142
Okay. If you are not Sylvia,

1104
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:08,105
then why did you come
into my room with a knife?!

1105
01:04:08,105 --> 01:04:10,275
-You said there were demons!
-Spirits.

1106
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:12,154
The walls were banging.
The lights went out.

1107
01:04:12,154 --> 01:04:13,658
There was that guy
I'd never seen before.

1108
01:04:13,658 --> 01:04:18,083
-Phillip, your beautiful son?
-I'm not her. I'm me!

1109
01:04:18,333 --> 01:04:20,212
Nico, she is not in there.

1110
01:04:20,379 --> 01:04:23,135
-You weren't trying
to kill us?
-No!

1111
01:04:27,936 --> 01:04:31,025
Jamie said that
when you get drunk,
you get violent.

1112
01:04:34,616 --> 01:04:35,869
I never hurt anyone.

1113
01:04:51,149 --> 01:04:54,113
You call me faggot
and then you tie me up.

1114
01:04:54,948 --> 01:04:57,495
-We never called you that.
-I know what I heard.

1115
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:04,593
No one here thinks you're gay,
maybe an asshole but--

1116
01:05:08,183 --> 01:05:09,812
I don't know any gay people.

1117
01:05:10,647 --> 01:05:13,611
And all of a sudden,
my brother, he's gay

1118
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:17,786
and he's getting gay
married and I'm having
parties with gay guys and--

1119
01:05:17,869 --> 01:05:19,038
Sounds so fun.

1120
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:23,714
-And then
you try to get me drunk.
-It was me!

1121
01:05:23,714 --> 01:05:25,050
-Oh honey.
-What?

1122
01:05:25,092 --> 01:05:27,263
Yeah. It was a mistake.
I thought it was my glass.

1123
01:05:27,346 --> 01:05:28,766
-You?
-And everyone was yelling

1124
01:05:28,766 --> 01:05:30,185
and I was super scared
and I just--

1125
01:05:30,185 --> 01:05:32,231
-It was an accident.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1126
01:05:32,356 --> 01:05:35,279
I'm- I'm really,
really sorry Harrison,

1127
01:05:35,655 --> 01:05:39,663
Larry, everyone
for wasting
such a good Merlot.

1128
01:05:39,913 --> 01:05:40,915
It's fine.

1129
01:05:43,671 --> 01:05:46,635
I'm just-- you know,

1130
01:05:47,428 --> 01:05:53,231
I have been trying really hard
to make things easier for you.

1131
01:05:55,737 --> 01:06:00,495
I even put you
over my friends,
which will not happen again

1132
01:06:01,247 --> 01:06:04,630
because I'm tired
of apologizing for myself.

1133
01:06:08,136 --> 01:06:11,727
And
Nico, you are not too much.

1134
01:06:12,604 --> 01:06:15,233
No, I am.
It's my superpower.

1135
01:06:17,154 --> 01:06:21,580
Yes it is.
And wait,
who did you have sex with?

1136
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:26,590
Oh my God.
Oh. Frank.

1137
01:06:26,674 --> 01:06:29,428
-Hi, Hi.
-Hi Reggie, this is Frank,
I got your message.

1138
01:06:29,470 --> 01:06:31,684
Yes. At first it was the pipes
and then it--

1139
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:34,648
-There's issues with
the water hammer so if you--
-Water hammer?

1140
01:06:34,648 --> 01:06:36,944
The water pressure gauge.
Uh, you need to I think--

1141
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:38,614
Water pressure... sorry.

1142
01:06:38,656 --> 01:06:39,950
I don't know
what any of these words mean.

1143
01:06:40,075 --> 01:06:41,077
I do.

1144
01:06:41,202 --> 01:06:43,331
You know,
that's causing the--

1145
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:45,670
Actually Frank,
you know what?
We're good.

1146
01:06:46,588 --> 01:06:49,553
Yes,
we did expel the evil energy
from the house.

1147
01:06:49,636 --> 01:06:53,101
So, um... actually Frank
right now is not a great time,

1148
01:06:53,101 --> 01:06:55,313
but you will
get your five stars, okay?
Kiss, kiss.

1149
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:28,421
Miss?

1150
01:07:36,647 --> 01:07:40,780
-Come to a meeting with me.
-Now?

1151
01:07:42,116 --> 01:07:43,118
When we get back.

1152
01:07:45,915 --> 01:07:50,550
Um, okay. Maybe. Okay.

1153
01:07:53,429 --> 01:07:56,687
Children,
should we call it a night?

1154
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:01,905
Um, should I learn that song?

1155
01:08:10,172 --> 01:08:13,303
<i>After you've gone</i>
<i>and left me crying</i>

1156
01:08:13,512 --> 01:08:16,768
<i>After you've gone</i>
<i>there's no denying</i>

1157
01:08:16,894 --> 01:08:20,275
<i>You'll feel blue,</i>

1158
01:08:20,568 --> 01:08:23,239
<i>You'll miss the bestest pal</i>
<i>you've ever had</i>

1159
01:08:23,699 --> 01:08:27,080
<i>There'll come a time,</i>
<i>now don't forget it</i>

1160
01:08:27,122 --> 01:08:30,503
<i>There'll come a time,</i>
<i>when you'll regret it</i>

1161
01:08:30,546 --> 01:08:34,053
<i>Oh baby,</i>

1162
01:08:34,345 --> 01:08:37,602

01:10:16,925 --> 01:10:21,977
-Well, um, I--
