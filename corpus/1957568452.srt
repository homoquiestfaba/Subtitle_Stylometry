1
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,873
Mommy?

2
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,198
Mommy?

3
00:03:43,484 --> 00:03:45,660
How many times do
I have to tell you?

4
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:49,881
Louis, what are you doing?

5
00:03:49,925 --> 00:03:51,361
I ask for a meal...

6
00:03:51,405 --> 00:03:52,232
Stop it.

7
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,276
I won't stop it!

8
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,801
Louis, please!

9
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,023
Stop it!

10
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:03,373
You're hurting me!

11
00:04:06,115 --> 00:04:07,986
What's wrong with you?

12
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:15,298
Nothin'.

13
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,996
Here's something new?

14
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,824
Stop it!

15
00:04:19,868 --> 00:04:20,999
Stop it!

16
00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:22,610
Come on!

17
00:04:22,653 --> 00:04:25,047
Stop it!
Stop it!

18
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:35,927
You're a bitch.

19
00:04:35,971 --> 00:04:37,842
Leave her alone!

20
00:04:37,886 --> 00:04:41,063
Stop it, Louis!
Leave us all alone!

21
00:04:41,106 --> 00:04:43,979
Please don't hurt my mommy.

22
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:20,972
Alex, I gotta go.

23
00:05:26,891 --> 00:05:29,198
Sid's got the bar, OK?

24
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:31,287
Yeah.

25
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:38,338
I forgot it was today.

26
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:40,731
Don't you need a jacket?

27
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,385
I'm fine.

28
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,693
Don't worry about me so much.

29
00:05:47,782 --> 00:05:49,044
Bye.

30
00:05:49,087 --> 00:05:51,002
Have fun.

31
00:05:51,046 --> 00:05:53,091
Yeah.

32
00:07:56,824 --> 00:07:58,695
You all right?

33
00:07:59,435 --> 00:08:01,350
Come here.

34
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:04,222
There we go.
Feel better?

35
00:08:05,267 --> 00:08:06,964
All right.

36
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:08,836
Now, open up.

37
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,753
Open up, there we go.

38
00:08:12,796 --> 00:08:14,494
Now tell me, Alex...

39
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:16,452
Did you miss me?

40
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:19,368
Come on. We're going to a party.

41
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:23,067
It is the anniversary
of your mother's death.

42
00:08:23,111 --> 00:08:25,026
I suggest you start driving.

43
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:28,072
I don't know how long
I'll be able to stay inside

44
00:08:28,116 --> 00:08:30,205
without pulling the trigger.

45
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:32,337
All right, then.
Just drive.

46
00:08:32,381 --> 00:08:34,775
Go on.

47
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,789
You've really grown up.

48
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:52,575
Turned into quite the lady,
very mature.

49
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,839
And very sexy.

50
00:08:56,971 --> 00:08:58,712
Wait a minute...

51
00:08:58,755 --> 00:09:00,061
This is new.

52
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:02,367
I'll bet you got
all the boys dreaming

53
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:05,196
about trying to get
their hands on these?

54
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:09,287
The things you could tell them?

55
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:13,248
The things I could tell them?

56
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:16,643
Now, 20 years is a long time
in between drinks,

57
00:09:16,686 --> 00:09:20,690
but I'll bet you haven't
forgotten about me.

58
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:23,867
Well, I'm trying to forget, too.

59
00:09:23,911 --> 00:09:27,741
Forget and forgive,
forgive and forget.

60
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:31,571
You can turn right at the light.

61
00:09:40,144 --> 00:09:42,712
Where the fuck are we going?

62
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:43,757
Don't curse!

63
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,455
It cheapens both of us!

64
00:09:46,498 --> 00:09:50,633
Where are we going?
A familiar place.

65
00:09:50,677 --> 00:09:54,419
You know,
jail is a great place to think, Alex.

66
00:09:54,463 --> 00:09:55,769
And I must say,

67
00:09:55,812 --> 00:09:59,686
not a day went by when
I didn't think about you.

68
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:03,559
I just knew we'd work
it all out someday.

69
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,998
'Cause I never hold a grudge
once I get even.

70
00:10:11,088 --> 00:10:12,786
Right, boys?

71
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:19,096
You just take us down there
to the old fun house.

72
00:10:19,706 --> 00:10:23,710
There is one thing
I regret, though.

73
00:10:23,753 --> 00:10:25,320
What's that?

74
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:27,803
I regret you're not going to
be around for the grand finale...

75
00:10:27,828 --> 00:10:29,498
The maddest of tea parties.

76
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,718
You always were
the showman, Louis.

77
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:34,677
It's gonna be quite a show,
I promise you.

78
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:36,679
And the best part...

79
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:40,640
Is what I'm gonna do with that
little cupcake sister of yours.

80
00:10:40,683 --> 00:10:42,511
You stay away from her.

81
00:10:42,554 --> 00:10:45,514
"You stay away from her!"

82
00:10:45,557 --> 00:10:47,951
Well, I can't do that.

83
00:10:47,995 --> 00:10:49,692
I'm sorry you won't
be there to see it,

84
00:10:49,736 --> 00:10:54,218
but we've all got to
make our little sacrifices.

85
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:57,308
Know what I mean?

86
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,571
Yeah.

87
00:10:59,615 --> 00:11:01,878
I think I do.

88
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,277
Showtime.

89
00:11:40,264 --> 00:11:43,137
What's going on in there?

90
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:48,446
Come on, Alex, what's going on?

91
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,667
Alex, you're flooding
the whole damn place.

92
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,583
I must have fallen asleep.

93
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,498
Did it seep through?

94
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,673
Hell, yeah, Alex...

95
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:59,397
That's why I've been
banging the door down.

96
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:03,035
Look at this.
What a mess.

97
00:12:28,965 --> 00:12:30,358
What a nightmare.

98
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:31,925
Yeah, well, shit happens.

99
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:35,972
I just don't see why it needs to
happen around here so much.

100
00:12:39,106 --> 00:12:40,020
Where's Sandra?

101
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,935
Said she had some singing thing.

102
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:44,894
Left in a big hurry.

103
00:12:47,201 --> 00:12:49,246
I'm sure of that.

104
00:12:52,119 --> 00:12:53,337
Hey, sweetheart...

105
00:12:53,381 --> 00:12:55,383
How about exercisin'
those great legs of yours

106
00:12:55,426 --> 00:12:58,386
and bringin' a fresh beer
for an old man?

107
00:12:58,429 --> 00:13:00,910
Tell you what...

108
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:06,350
How about an old beer
for a fresh man?

109
00:13:07,264 --> 00:13:08,962
That beer's not so old.

110
00:13:09,005 --> 00:13:10,485
By the way,
where's your partner?

111
00:13:10,528 --> 00:13:12,487
Don't know.
She's supposed to be here.

112
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:15,620
Maybe she thought we
could use some time alone.

113
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:21,713
Yeah, and maybe Alex might
let us drink for free all night.

114
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:24,020
Maybe.

115
00:13:24,716 --> 00:13:27,284
And unlikely.

116
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:29,809
Hey, which one's the maybe?

117
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,433
Alex, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

118
00:13:45,476 --> 00:13:46,390
Hey!

119
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:48,131
Yo, chill!

120
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:49,872
Did you have a nice afternoon?

121
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:50,873
Oh, please.

122
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:52,744
They were running
two hours late.

123
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,050
I was gonna blow it off,

124
00:13:54,094 --> 00:13:55,095
and then they called me.

125
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,538
Do you know how
to use one of these?

126
00:13:56,574 --> 00:14:00,100
You pick it up, dial,
listen for the ringing sound...

127
00:14:00,143 --> 00:14:02,015
Alex...

128
00:14:02,058 --> 00:14:03,233
I was gonna call you. I was.

129
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,932
But there was one
phone in the whole place,

130
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:06,933
I swear.

131
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:12,329
You've got customers.

132
00:14:12,373 --> 00:14:15,202
Hello, customers.

133
00:14:37,615 --> 00:14:39,356
Well, good night, ladies.

134
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,010
You leaving, Sid?
Yup.

135
00:14:41,054 --> 00:14:41,924
I'll miss you.

136
00:14:41,968 --> 00:14:43,273
See you tomorrow.

137
00:14:43,317 --> 00:14:44,361
Get some sleep.

138
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:45,232
You, too.

139
00:14:45,275 --> 00:14:48,191
Hey... try a bed this time.

140
00:14:51,412 --> 00:14:54,806
I heard you had quite a bath today,
Alex.

141
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,113
I was having that
nightmare again.

142
00:14:57,157 --> 00:14:58,419
You were?

143
00:14:58,462 --> 00:15:01,813
Well,
now we just have one more thing to fix

144
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:05,817
before we sell this taco stand.

145
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:08,211
I'm doing everything I
can to fix this place up

146
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:10,431
so we can get out of here.

147
00:15:10,474 --> 00:15:14,130
Well, maybe the first
part of that's true.

148
00:15:14,174 --> 00:15:15,334
What's that supposed to mean?

149
00:15:15,378 --> 00:15:16,978
What it means is that
you've been talking

150
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:18,961
about getting us out
of here for a while.

151
00:15:19,005 --> 00:15:23,226
I'm sorry you had a bad dream.

152
00:15:27,187 --> 00:15:29,624
Good night.

153
00:15:29,667 --> 00:15:32,148
I love you.

154
00:16:42,392 --> 00:16:43,524
Watch your step.

155
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:45,961
It's a little slippery
on the bottom.

156
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,310
How bad is it?

157
00:16:47,354 --> 00:16:49,486
You'll see.

158
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,927
Shit.

159
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:26,480
Hello?

160
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,005
Hello?

161
00:17:31,876 --> 00:17:33,008
Ma'am?

162
00:17:39,536 --> 00:17:41,669
Can I help you?

163
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,936
Mercer, sit.

164
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,855
I need a pump.

165
00:17:53,898 --> 00:17:57,380
Oh, don't we all?

166
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:02,037
You local?

167
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:03,995
Yeah.

168
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,650
Well, where do you live?

169
00:18:06,694 --> 00:18:08,739
The old mermaid inn,

170
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:09,914
just down the road a bit.

171
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,960
I've got a flood in my basement.

172
00:18:12,003 --> 00:18:16,486
Do you have a pump or
something that I could rent?

173
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,922
Oh, yeah.

174
00:18:17,966 --> 00:18:23,493
I-I'm sure I've got something
lying around out back.

175
00:18:39,857 --> 00:18:42,991
Would that do it for you, then?

176
00:18:43,034 --> 00:18:44,993
Yeah.

177
00:18:45,341 --> 00:18:47,082
And this.

178
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:56,613
Did you say you were
from the old mermaid bar?

179
00:18:56,657 --> 00:18:58,354
Yes.

180
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:03,838
Funny...

181
00:19:03,881 --> 00:19:07,972
I thought they closed
that place down.

182
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:08,973
No.

183
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:12,542
Not yet, anyway.

184
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,430
Hey, is your car dirty?

185
00:19:30,473 --> 00:19:33,128
Well, if it is, you come on down
to Cal's car wash, all right?

186

Well, howdy.
Welcome to Cal's.

189
00:19:57,283 --> 00:19:58,762
Have we got a special today.

190
00:19:58,806 --> 00:20:01,852
Our executive car wash
is only $12.99.

191
00:20:01,896 --> 00:20:03,289
Just fluff and fold.

192
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:04,899
You know, for only
an extra dollar

193
00:20:04,942 --> 00:20:07,342
you can get the hot wax and
the super deluxe vinyl treatment.

194
00:20:07,367 --> 00:20:08,468
No thanks.

195
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:09,791
Well, you seem like a nice girl.

196
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:11,155
I'll tell you what
I'm gonna do...

197
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,861
I'm gonna throw it in for free.

198

Help me!

Will you? Won't you?
Will you? Won't you?

202
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,407
Won't you join the dance?

203
00:26:23,451 --> 00:26:28,369
Go on. This one's
especially for you.

204
00:26:28,412 --> 00:26:29,631
What's your name?

205
00:26:29,675 --> 00:26:31,590
Alex.

206
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:34,027
Hello, Alex!

207
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,506
I'm Louis.

208
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,379
You're not here at the
carnival by yourself, are you?

209
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:41,469
I lost my mommy.

210
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:44,864
Lost your mommy?

211
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:46,648
Well...

212
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:51,305
I'm sure she's
around here somewhere.

213
00:26:52,132 --> 00:26:53,786
Wanna go to the fun house?

214
00:26:53,829 --> 00:26:55,265
It's fun.

215
00:26:55,309 --> 00:26:57,659
Thank god... there you are!

216
00:26:57,703 --> 00:26:59,922
Honey, I've been looking
all over for you.

217
00:26:59,966 --> 00:27:02,272
You can't just
wander off like that.

218
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:06,494
Are you OK, sweetheart?

219
00:27:07,103 --> 00:27:09,018
You must be mommy.

220
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:10,759
Elaine.

221
00:27:13,936 --> 00:27:15,590
Don't be too hard on her.

222
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:18,071
We were just gonna come
looking for you.

223
00:27:18,114 --> 00:27:19,420
Ain't that right, Alex?

224
00:27:19,463 --> 00:27:20,813
I was terribly worried.

225
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,902
I just turned around for
a minute, and she was gone.

226
00:27:22,945 --> 00:27:25,905
It's so hard to keep track
of two little ones.

227
00:27:25,948 --> 00:27:29,560
Well,
you can't be expected to do it all alone.

228
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,432
Where's daddy tonight?

229
00:27:31,475 --> 00:27:36,219
Daddy's where the balloons fly.

230
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,482
Well, hello there.

231
00:27:38,526 --> 00:27:40,180
What's your name?

232
00:27:40,223 --> 00:27:41,355
Sandra.

233
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:43,531
Well, Sandra,

234
00:27:43,574 --> 00:27:45,707
if your daddy's
with the balloons,

235
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:49,276
I bet he's having
a wonderful time.

236
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:50,843
Do you like balloons?

237
00:27:50,886 --> 00:27:52,932
No.

238
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,066
She doesn't like balloons.

239
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,372
Honey!

240
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:02,202
Well, thank you
for finding Alex.

241
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:07,381
Actually, I didn't find her.

242
00:28:07,424 --> 00:28:10,514
She found me.

243
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:13,082
Gotcha!

244
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:16,695
Well, either way,
I'm very grateful.

245
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:19,088
Then perhaps you'd let me
buy you a drink sometime?

246
00:28:19,132 --> 00:28:22,483
I tell you what...
I run the mermaid bar

247
00:28:22,526 --> 00:28:23,919
a few miles down the road.

248
00:28:23,963 --> 00:28:27,444
Why don't you come by
and I'll buy you a drink?

249
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:30,404
It would be my pleasure.

250
00:28:31,057 --> 00:28:33,407
Enjoy the rest of the carnival.

251
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,626
And remember...

252
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:39,239
The fun is just beginning.

253
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:04,786
Sorry, I didn't mean
to scare you.

254
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,875
Are you looking for someone?

255
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:08,485
No, I was just...

256
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,661
Just looking.

257
00:29:10,705 --> 00:29:13,926
Yeah. I used to come here
when I was a kid.

258
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,536
Are you a cop?

259
00:29:15,579 --> 00:29:17,320
No, no, not really.

260
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:19,192
But I am in charge of
patrolling this property

261
00:29:19,235 --> 00:29:22,891
and technically
you are trespassing.

262
00:29:22,935 --> 00:29:25,198
I'm sorry.
I was just...

263
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:26,590
Don't sweat it.

264
00:29:26,634 --> 00:29:30,029
It'll be our little secret.

265
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:32,814
Nice boat.

266
00:29:33,336 --> 00:29:34,381
Thanks.

267
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:36,122
It's not much,
but it gets me around.

268
00:29:36,165 --> 00:29:37,732
Would you like to go for a ride?

269
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,301
No, I really don't
like the water.

270
00:29:41,344 --> 00:29:42,737
A harbor's a funny place to live

271
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,828
for someone who doesn't
like the water.

272
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:48,090
I'm Michael.

273
00:29:48,134 --> 00:29:49,222
Alex.

274
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:52,181
Alex.

275
00:29:52,225 --> 00:29:55,619
Well, Alex, maybe sometime
you'll let me take you for a ride.

276
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:57,534
Maybe I will.

277
00:29:57,578 --> 00:30:00,755
Until we meet again.

278
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:03,845
Will we?

279
00:30:03,889 --> 00:30:06,456
I think we might.

280
00:30:51,588 --> 00:30:52,938
Hey there.

281
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:54,243
Hey.

282
00:30:54,287 --> 00:30:56,898
I got some spackle
for the ceiling.

283
00:30:56,942 --> 00:30:59,074
And a pump for the cellar.

284
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,859
There's no leak in the bathroom.

285
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:02,622
I don't know where
that water's coming from.

286
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:06,865
It does look like I'm gonna
have to do some spackling.

287
00:31:06,908 --> 00:31:08,997
I appreciate it.

288
00:31:09,041 --> 00:31:10,390
Things under control here?

289
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:13,480
Yeah, yeah,
it's pretty dead in here tonight.

290
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:14,829
Wait a minute...

291
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,527
You left it at the bar
last night.

292
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:18,746
I did?

293
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:19,965
Yeah. Left it in the tip jar,

294
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,402
told me to hang on
to it for you.

295
00:31:22,445 --> 00:31:25,100
I... don't remember.

296
00:31:25,144 --> 00:31:26,319
Well, thanks.

297
00:31:26,362 --> 00:31:28,190
Yeah, no problem.
Hey...

298
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,018
You OK?

299
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:32,325
Yeah. Fine.

300
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,014
You could bottle that stuff

301
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:11,016
and sell shots of it for a buck.

302
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,236
I know at least a couple
of people who would try it.

303
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:18,371
Yeah, but then they'd
want it all the time.

304
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,320
So it looks like they
might be setting up

305
00:32:21,345 --> 00:32:23,463
the old carnival out there?

306
00:32:23,506 --> 00:32:25,508
I doubt it.

307
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:30,383
There hasn't been a carnival
out there in over 20 years.

308
00:33:06,636 --> 00:33:08,464
Sid?

309
00:33:17,082 --> 00:33:19,214
Who's there?

310
00:33:30,225 --> 00:33:33,011
Who's there?

311
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,764
No...

312
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,724
No what?

313
00:33:53,118 --> 00:33:55,555
Nothing.

314
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:56,355
Wanna know what
little girls are made of?

315
00:34:56,398 --> 00:35:01,534
Sugar and spice
and everything nice.

316
00:35:08,758 --> 00:35:09,411
Get away!

317
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:12,153
Alex! Stop!
It's me!

318
00:35:12,197 --> 00:35:13,459
It's me.

319
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:16,201
I was washing my face.

320
00:35:21,293 --> 00:35:22,772
I couldn't breathe.

321
00:35:22,816 --> 00:35:26,472
Can you breathe now?

322
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:16,478
Where did this come from?

323
00:36:16,522 --> 00:36:17,784
Told you...

324
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:19,707
I know what you told me.
Where did it come from?

325
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:22,615
I don't know, Alex.
I never saw it before last night.

326
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:25,052
You didn't see anybody
leave it on the bar?

327
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,141
Nobody handed it to you?

328
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,057
Yes. You did.

329
00:36:32,842 --> 00:36:35,105
Is it bad?

330
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,719
I don't know what it is.

331
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:49,946
How'd you like to drink
for free tonight?

332
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:55,865
Sounds like you need a favor.

333
00:36:56,518 --> 00:36:58,825
I do.

334
00:37:00,827 --> 00:37:03,003
This the guy?

335
00:37:03,046 --> 00:37:04,874
Yeah, that's him.

336
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,136
You sure?

337
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,442
Positive.

338
00:37:07,486 --> 00:37:11,359
You went through this
pretty carefully.

339
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,496
Oh, yeah.
He was quite a charmer.

340
00:37:17,539 --> 00:37:22,979
Had numerous arrests for
questionable behavior around children.

341
00:37:23,023 --> 00:37:24,764
And quite a penchant
for little girls.

342
00:37:24,807 --> 00:37:30,639
Managed to stay out of reach by
moving from one carnival to the next...

343
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:34,861
That is until he was convicted
of rape and murder in 1977

344
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:38,081
and sentenced to life in prison.

345
00:37:38,125 --> 00:37:39,169
Yeah, I know that.

346
00:37:39,213 --> 00:37:40,649
I'm sure you do.

347
00:37:40,693 --> 00:37:44,174
The report says it was your
testimony that put him away.

348
00:37:44,218 --> 00:37:48,396
That's quite a lot to
handle for a 12-year-old.

349
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,572
I was 11.

350
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,709
He served his term in folsom

351
00:37:56,752 --> 00:38:00,408
and was paroled in '96.

352
00:38:01,366 --> 00:38:03,019
And?

353
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,583
And I suppose you think he's
come to thank you for the vacation?

354
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:06,588
Something like that.

355
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:09,504
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't count on it.

356
00:38:10,462 --> 00:38:13,508
Have you got a strong stomach?

357
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:19,384
Now you tell me, Alex...

358
00:38:19,645 --> 00:38:21,473
Does that look like
someone who's about

359
00:38:21,516 --> 00:38:23,518
to come knocking on your door?

360
00:38:23,562 --> 00:38:26,739
Sometimes bad memories have
a way of following you around.

361
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,045
You know what I'm saying?

362
00:38:29,089 --> 00:38:31,439
I am not crazy.

363
00:38:31,483 --> 00:38:32,571
I'm sorry, Alex.

364
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:35,530
I don't know what
I can do to help you.

365
00:38:44,626 --> 00:38:46,411
You need to wait
until it dries, Sid.

366
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:47,934
I'll be an old man by then.

367
00:38:47,977 --> 00:38:51,807
Come on,
we're just gonna have to do it again.

368
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:55,550
Nope, I've almost got it...

369
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,299
Damn it!

370
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,387
I'm sorry, Alex.

371
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:07,780
"I'm sorry, Alex"?

372
00:39:07,823 --> 00:39:10,826
How about listening
to me for once?

373
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,926
Feels good, doesn't it?

374
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,712
I have to get
Sandy to the doctor.

375
00:40:10,756 --> 00:40:12,322
You two gonna be...

376
00:40:12,366 --> 00:40:13,454
Oh, honey, that's great!

377
00:40:13,498 --> 00:40:17,806
Is Louis turning you
into a clown?

378
00:40:18,807 --> 00:40:21,157
Will you be staying for dinner?

379
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:22,245
Probably not.

380
00:40:22,289 --> 00:40:23,290
Mommy...

381
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,204
It's OK, sweetheart.

382
00:40:24,247 --> 00:40:26,336
I'll be back in a little while.

383
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:30,340
You remember your bedtime, OK?

384
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:53,146
Alex?

385
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:55,975
Can I come in?

386
00:41:11,338 --> 00:41:14,950
It's quite a look for you.

387
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:23,132
Bad day?

388
00:41:24,743 --> 00:41:25,961
I've had better.

389
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:27,615
Apparently.

390
00:41:27,659 --> 00:41:29,791
I've been seeing things.

391
00:41:29,835 --> 00:41:30,792
Have you?

392
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:32,794
Things that can't be real.

393
00:41:32,838 --> 00:41:34,796
What?

394
00:41:35,231 --> 00:41:38,191
I thought I saw Louis.

395
00:41:38,234 --> 00:41:39,888
Really?

396
00:41:39,932 --> 00:41:43,718
Was he riding the
Loch Ness monster?

397
00:41:43,762 --> 00:41:45,677
Sandra, it's not funny.

398
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,766
No, it's not funny.

399
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:50,812
It's not funny at all.

400
00:41:52,292 --> 00:41:55,251
Al, this place
isn't right for us.

401
00:41:55,295 --> 00:41:56,644
I can handle it.

402
00:41:56,688 --> 00:41:59,560
Can you?
And how come you look like this?

403
00:41:59,604 --> 00:42:01,562
And how come every
time I turn around

404
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:03,042
something else is broken?

405
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:04,217
I'm getting it together.

406
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,820
Why is it that every
time someone offers

407
00:42:05,845 --> 00:42:06,828
to buy this shithole,

408
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:08,526
it's not good enough for you?

409
00:42:08,569 --> 00:42:09,831
Not good enough for us.

410
00:42:09,875 --> 00:42:10,745
Fuck that!

411
00:42:10,789 --> 00:42:12,181
Why don't you just admit to me

412
00:42:12,225 --> 00:42:14,619
that you don't really want
to sell this place at all?

413
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:17,404
Because I don't.

414
00:42:18,274 --> 00:42:21,626
This is mom's place.

415
00:42:26,718 --> 00:42:30,460
I know it's not much.

416
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:34,813
But it's all that
we have left of her.

417
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:39,731
If we let it go...

418
00:42:41,863 --> 00:42:45,606
Our memories of her
will go with it.

419
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,225
I have a present for you.

420
00:43:00,142 --> 00:43:04,016
I was saving this
for your birthday.

421
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:14,722
Remember how scared you
were to ride the Ferris wheel?

422
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:15,767
Yeah.

423
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,204
Till mom told me
it was like jumping,

424
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:22,121
except you never really fall.

425
00:43:25,646 --> 00:43:28,823
It's all right there.

426
00:43:30,129 --> 00:43:33,741
It's all right here.

427
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:37,832
And no one can take that
away from you.

428
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:44,665
I'm not ready to go.

429
00:43:45,405 --> 00:43:48,103
I know.

430
00:43:48,669 --> 00:43:52,412
But you're closer
than you think.

431
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,244
And until then...

432
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:03,292
I guess we'll just have
to stick around here...

433
00:44:03,336 --> 00:44:08,123
Till you feel like you can
take those memories with you.

434
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:18,133
In the meantime,
why don't you take it easy tonight?

435
00:44:18,177 --> 00:44:19,178
But the bar...

436
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:21,746
I'll worry about the bar.

437
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:25,184
I owe you one, anyways.

438
00:44:30,363 --> 00:44:32,713
Thanks.

439
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:55,350
Hey, get out of here!

440
00:47:55,394 --> 00:47:58,310
You're not ready yet!

441
00:48:12,454 --> 00:48:14,239
Let me out of here!

442
00:48:51,189 --> 00:48:53,887
Hi, Dr. Goldfine, please?

443
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:58,805
Yes, this is Alex Grant.
I'm a patient of his.

444
00:48:58,848 --> 00:49:02,026
Yes, I need to see him again.

445
00:49:02,287 --> 00:49:05,943
No, no, I... I don't...

446
00:49:06,421 --> 00:49:09,294
I can't wait that long.

447
00:49:10,338 --> 00:49:14,038
Fine.
Yeah, I understand.

448
00:49:18,259 --> 00:49:21,001
Yeah. I-I'll do that.

449
00:49:28,487 --> 00:49:31,838
How can then voice of dread,

450
00:49:31,881 --> 00:49:33,448
With bitter tidings laden,

451
00:49:33,492 --> 00:49:35,798
shall summon to unwelcome bed

452
00:49:35,842 --> 00:49:38,453
a melancholy maiden?

453
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:40,412
But not yet!

454
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:42,501
Wanna do my makeup?

455
00:49:42,544 --> 00:49:46,200
But your face is already done.

456
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:51,118
We're not gonna do my face.

457
00:50:17,536 --> 00:50:18,754
Thanks.

458
00:50:18,798 --> 00:50:20,060
Yeah.

459
00:50:20,104 --> 00:50:22,584
Listen,
I'm sorry I snapped at you last night.

460
00:50:22,628 --> 00:50:26,327
I-I'm just kind of...

461
00:50:26,893 --> 00:50:29,896
Hey. It's all right.

462
00:50:29,939 --> 00:50:33,508
I know you've been having
a hard time.

463
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:36,511
It's gonna be OK, though.

464
00:50:36,555 --> 00:50:39,688
I hope you know that.

465
00:50:40,515 --> 00:50:42,430
Thanks.

466
00:50:42,474 --> 00:50:46,130
Look, let me get you
some more longnecks.

467
00:50:54,834 --> 00:50:57,750
Alex?

468
00:51:04,017 --> 00:51:06,715
You doing OK?

469
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:09,283
Me?

470
00:51:09,327 --> 00:51:10,197
I feel great.

471
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,112
You're a great bartender, Alex,

472
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:15,594
but you're a terrible liar.

473
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:17,552
A penny for your thoughts.

474
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:20,381
Henry...

475
00:51:20,686 --> 00:51:21,966
Do you ever think a person knows

476
00:51:21,991 --> 00:51:23,776
that they're going crazy?

477
00:51:23,819 --> 00:51:25,691
I don't know.

478
00:51:25,734 --> 00:51:27,214
I think there's far more people

479
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:31,479
who think they know when
someone else is goin' crazy.

480
00:51:31,523 --> 00:51:33,612
Hey, Alex...

481
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:37,181
Yes?

482
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:39,792
Two beers.

483
00:51:58,463 --> 00:52:02,293
Alex, behind you.

484
00:52:02,554 --> 00:52:05,905
All right... you tip on the tabs.

485
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:15,784
These guys wanna hear me sing.

486
00:52:15,828 --> 00:52:16,916
Do they?

487
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:21,399
Yeah. But I told them we're busy,
so...

488
00:52:22,574 --> 00:52:25,316
So, you've got a good audience.

489
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:28,493
Go ahead. I'll take care
of things back here.

490
00:52:28,536 --> 00:52:29,798
Yeah?

491
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:31,844
Yeah.

00:53:41,653 --> 00:53:45,700

No thanks.

511
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,822
I don't like to drink.

512
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:25,566
A bar's a funny place for
someone who doesn't like to drink.

513
00:54:29,744 --> 00:54:31,920
What do you like?

514
00:54:34,706 --> 00:54:36,925
You know, I could be wrong,

515
00:54:36,969 --> 00:54:40,538
but I get a feeling you
might be flirting with me.

516
00:54:41,452 --> 00:54:44,019
I'm just making conversation.

517
00:54:44,063 --> 00:54:46,021
It's part of the job, you know.

518
00:54:46,065 --> 00:54:48,589
Yeah, I know.

519
00:54:48,633 --> 00:54:52,114
And she who flirts with
all is less likely to fall

520
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:56,902
than she who flirts
with just one. Right?

521
00:54:58,382 --> 00:55:00,993
Alex?

522
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:07,347
Let me buy you a drink.

523
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:09,480
Take the edge off.

524
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:17,531
Buy me one later.

525
00:55:18,663 --> 00:55:21,056
You're not afraid, are you?

526
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:24,190
I'm not afraid.

527
00:55:25,539 --> 00:55:28,542
But you will be.

528
00:55:28,586 --> 00:55:31,806
You will be.

529
00:55:39,945 --> 00:55:41,599
Great.

530
00:55:41,642 --> 00:55:43,296
What's up with you?

531
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,386
Nothing.
I'm fine.

532
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:49,563
You been sneaking
martinis behind the bar?

533
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:52,392
No, I'm fine.

534
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:55,177
Ok.

535
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:11,280
Did you tell him I was here?

536
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:15,894
Well?

537
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:19,114
What did he say?

538
00:56:19,158 --> 00:56:23,989
He said he would be
with you shortly.

539
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:44,226
Alex Grant.

540
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:45,184
Yes?

541
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:49,188
The doctor is ready for you now.

542
00:56:53,714 --> 00:56:56,848
It's down the hall
and to the right.

543
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:58,980
Yes, I know where it is.

544
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:18,652
Thank you for seeing
me on such short notice.

545
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:22,047
I felt that it
just couldn't wait.

546
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:23,744
What's going on?

547
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:29,576
Well, I've been having the... You know,
the stress thing.

548
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,752
Like right after the accident.

549
00:57:31,796 --> 00:57:33,450
Car accident?

550
00:57:33,493 --> 00:57:35,364
Yes.

551
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:41,632
I've been telling myself
that everything's... Fine

552
00:57:41,675 --> 00:57:43,634
and that I'm OK.

553
00:57:45,636 --> 00:57:48,552
Everything's not fine,

554
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:50,336
and I'm not OK.

555
00:57:50,379 --> 00:57:52,077
What seems to be the problem?

556
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:55,123
I've been seeing things.

557
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:57,648
What is it that
you've been seeing?

558
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,650
Louis.

559
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:02,870
I've been seeing Louis.

560
00:58:02,914 --> 00:58:04,045
And...

561
00:58:04,089 --> 00:58:06,831
Have you tried talking
to him about that?

562
00:58:07,832 --> 00:58:09,094
He's dead.

563
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:10,748
I see.

564
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:14,578
Don't you remember?
You counseled me right after the accident.

565
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:16,667
You said...

566
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:22,368
Look, I think I need
some help here.

567
00:58:23,021 --> 00:58:27,852
Alex, I will try
my best to help you.

568
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:33,031
Can I smoke in here?

569
00:58:33,074 --> 00:58:35,076
Of course.

570
00:58:37,862 --> 00:58:42,170
How long ago did this
accident take place?

571
00:58:43,215 --> 00:58:44,695
5 months ago.

572
00:58:44,738 --> 00:58:48,525
Are you telling me that you
can't remember back 5 months?

573
00:58:48,568 --> 00:58:50,091
Yes, we keep excellent records,

574
00:58:50,135 --> 00:58:54,792
and I like to think I keep
very good track of my patients.

575
00:58:56,054 --> 00:58:57,751
Good, you can pull my file,

576
00:58:57,795 --> 00:59:01,712
and you can see that I'm
not some kind of wacko.

577
00:59:01,755 --> 00:59:03,452
There is no file on you.

578
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:05,280
What do you mean
there's no file?

579
00:59:05,324 --> 00:59:08,806
I've never met you before today.

580
00:59:12,505 --> 00:59:14,333
Who are you?

581
00:59:14,376 --> 00:59:15,464
Alex, please.

582
00:59:15,508 --> 00:59:18,337
Look, I would like to...

583
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,861
Suggest...

584
00:59:22,646 --> 00:59:25,387
Alex?

585
00:59:44,102 --> 00:59:47,845
I take it that one's
not worth remembering.

586
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:53,851
Now you're trespassing.

587
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:55,287
I know.

588
00:59:55,330 --> 00:59:57,637
I was wondering if you're
ready for that boat ride.

589
00:59:57,681 --> 00:59:59,683
I can't leave Sandra alone.

590
00:59:59,726 --> 01:00:04,862
I have a feeling she
can take care of herself.

591
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,255
I like your necklace.

592
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:09,997
Thanks.
It belonged to my mother.

593
01:00:10,041 --> 01:00:12,391
Before she died.

594
01:00:15,263 --> 01:00:16,700
It reminds me of her.

595
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:19,790
Memento Mori.

596
01:00:19,833 --> 01:00:21,443
May I?

597
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:23,881
Yeah.

598
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:25,883
She died too soon.

599
01:00:25,926 --> 01:00:29,016
How do you know that?

600
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:30,757
Because I saw it.

601
01:00:30,801 --> 01:00:33,934
But you can't know that.

602
01:00:33,978 --> 01:00:36,545
Only she can know if
she was ready to die.

603
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:39,287
Trust me, she wasn't ready.

604
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:43,683
That may be true,
but it's a very personal thing.

605
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:48,601
One dies when she wants,
as she wants,

606
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:49,994
of what she chooses.

607
01:00:50,037 --> 01:00:54,651
My mother chose a man
she thought she could trust.

608
01:00:57,131 --> 01:01:01,309
Memento Mori doesn't mean
to remember the dead, anyway.

609
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:04,835
What is it, then?

610
01:01:04,878 --> 01:01:10,318
To remember that
we all must die.

611
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:15,976
I have to get to work.

612
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:27,596
I know it sounds impossible,

613
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:31,513
but I know he's here.

614
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:35,692
Come on, Al,
Louis is dead, remember?

615
01:01:37,868 --> 01:01:39,783
Ok...

616
01:01:39,826 --> 01:01:41,219
Let me put it this way.

617
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:45,527
If Louis were still
creeping around the house,

618
01:01:45,571 --> 01:01:47,486
which he is not,

619
01:01:47,529 --> 01:01:51,533
but if he were,
and he wanted to get you,

620
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:54,711
why wouldn't he have
gotten you sooner?

621
01:01:54,754 --> 01:01:57,844
Because that
wouldn't be any fun.

622
01:01:59,454 --> 01:02:02,806
OK, whatever.

623
01:02:02,849 --> 01:02:03,807
I'm out of here.

624
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,635
I'm ready to get
out of here, too.

625
01:02:06,679 --> 01:02:08,855
Excuse me?

626
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:15,122
I said I want to leave
and not come back.

627
01:02:18,822 --> 01:02:20,258
That's great.
That's great.

628
01:02:20,301 --> 01:02:24,784
I think there's
hope for you yet.

629
01:02:24,828 --> 01:02:26,873
I got to go.

630
01:02:28,048 --> 01:02:29,789
Wait...

631
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,791
What?

632
01:02:31,835 --> 01:02:33,793
Take this with you.

633
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:34,925
Thank you very much.

634
01:02:34,968 --> 01:02:37,144
You're going out like that?

635
01:02:37,188 --> 01:02:39,146
Yes, I'm going out like this.

636
01:02:40,713 --> 01:02:42,149
What?

637
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:46,023
I said I'll be fine.
Try not to worry about me so much.

638
01:02:46,066 --> 01:02:47,851
It's supposed to rain later,
and...

639
01:02:47,894 --> 01:02:48,808
Alex...

640
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:53,334
I'll be fine.

641
01:04:02,664 --> 01:04:05,624
Hello?

642
01:04:33,086 --> 01:04:35,872
Sandra?

643
01:04:48,841 --> 01:04:50,625
Sandra!

644
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,617
Sorry, miss, we're not open yet.

645
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:13,665
Oh, Alex, hi!
I didn't see it was you.

646
01:06:13,708 --> 01:06:16,407
Come on, don't
look so surprised.

647
01:06:16,450 --> 01:06:20,715
I told you I never hold a
grudge once I get even.

648
01:06:20,759 --> 01:06:21,803
You know...

649
01:06:21,847 --> 01:06:24,806
I think I've figured out
your problem.

650
01:06:24,850 --> 01:06:27,984
Well, one of your problems.

651
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:31,683
You don't know how
to have any fun.

652
01:06:31,726 --> 01:06:34,903
See, aren't you glad we met?

653
01:06:34,947 --> 01:06:37,689
I curse the day
you ever found me.

654
01:06:38,777 --> 01:06:42,389
Am I bleeding?
I think I've been cut.

655
01:06:42,433 --> 01:06:45,740
You've still got it wrong, Alex.

656
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:48,874
I didn't find you.

657
01:06:50,093 --> 01:06:52,617
You found me.

658
01:06:52,660 --> 01:06:55,489
You can find me again, Alex.

659
01:06:55,533 --> 01:06:59,319
You've always known
where to find me.

660
01:06:59,363 --> 01:07:00,929
No!

661
01:08:25,536 --> 01:08:27,842
I'll take you.

662
01:08:51,649 --> 01:08:54,173
I feel like I'm going to hell.

663
01:08:54,217 --> 01:09:00,005
Sometimes you have to face your
demons in order to see the angels, Alex.

664
01:09:11,190 --> 01:09:15,063
It's time to let go.

665
01:09:15,107 --> 01:09:17,109
I can't.

666
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,200
I haven't lived yet.

667
01:09:21,244 --> 01:09:24,377
Then why are you here?

668
01:10:55,642 --> 01:10:57,818
Michael.

669
01:12:53,412 --> 01:12:56,894
I'm late. I'm late
for a very important date.

670
01:12:57,764 --> 01:12:59,766
Watch where you're going.

671
01:13:12,823 --> 01:13:17,349
I told you to watch
where you're going.

672
01:13:43,375 --> 01:13:45,377
Gotcha!

673
01:16:25,450 --> 01:16:26,886
Help me, Alex!

674
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:30,281
Please don't leave me here.

675
01:16:30,324 --> 01:16:33,240
Don't leave me alone with him.

676
01:16:33,284 --> 01:16:34,372
Please!

677
01:16:34,415 --> 01:16:37,593
It's you he wants!

678
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:11,191
Nice of you to join us, Alex.

679
01:17:32,822 --> 01:17:34,214
Remember this?

680
01:17:34,258 --> 01:17:37,391
This is my favorite part.

681
01:17:38,744 --> 01:17:40,704
Shame you caught me
and your mother doing it, too.

682
01:17:40,729 --> 01:17:42,135
Might not have had to kill her.

683
01:17:42,179 --> 01:17:43,528
You would have anyway.

684
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:46,183
She knew you could only
get it up with little girls.

685
01:17:46,226 --> 01:17:48,446
You know, guilt is
a funny thing, Alex.

686
01:17:48,489 --> 01:17:50,709
It haunts you
as real as any ghost.

687
01:17:51,971 --> 01:17:53,034
I think you're just
too scared to admit it.

688
01:17:53,059 --> 01:17:54,582
Which is fine
with us, by the way,

689
01:17:54,626 --> 01:17:56,193
because the longer you hang on,

690
01:17:56,236 --> 01:17:59,675
the longer we get to play.

691
01:18:00,240 --> 01:18:05,506
I'm just hanging on long enough
to blow your fucking head off.

692
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:07,857
Don't be hasty.

693
01:18:07,900 --> 01:18:10,511
You wouldn't hurt
a clown, would you?

694
01:18:13,732 --> 01:18:16,039
Will I?
Won't I?

695
01:18:16,082 --> 01:18:17,170
You don't have the guts.

696
01:18:17,214 --> 01:18:20,739
Will I?
Won't I?

697
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:25,048
Won't I join the dance?

698
01:19:28,720 --> 01:19:31,636
Come on, Sandra!

699
01:20:02,362 --> 01:20:08,194
Sometimes bad memories have
a way of following you around.

700
01:20:12,851 --> 01:20:18,378
I said I'll be fine.
Quit worrying about me so much.

701
01:20:24,907 --> 01:20:27,735
You're not afraid, are you?

702
01:20:31,261 --> 01:20:35,265
Sid, voice-over: I KNOW
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME.

703
01:20:35,308 --> 01:20:38,007
It's going to be OK, though.

704
01:20:38,050 --> 01:20:40,226
I hope you know that.

705
01:21:52,255 --> 01:21:54,083
Al?

706
01:21:56,259 --> 01:21:58,174
Alex?

707
01:22:01,307 --> 01:22:03,396
That looks like your car.

708
01:22:07,313 --> 01:22:09,011
Ain't this where they
had that carnival?

709
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:14,494
Carnival? Hasn't been a
carnival out here in 20 years.

710
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:51,401
Did you notice any strange behavior?
Mood swings?

711
01:22:51,444 --> 01:22:54,839
When was the last
time you saw her?

712
01:22:56,754 --> 01:22:58,756
Excuse me.

713
01:23:49,067 --> 01:23:51,156
Hello.

714
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:57,554
Hello?
