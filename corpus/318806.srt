George!

7
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:19,162
You got scared.

8
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,019
Take this off.

00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,403
Stupid...

Hey! Stop it.
They're for my mom.

Come on, what do you want,
some Halloween balloons,

00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,745
or a hot night with me?

13
00:01:59,912 --> 00:02:00,787
Balloons will last longer.

14
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,873

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,001

No, we're not.
There's no one out here.

24
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,941
Come on, get busy.

00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,194
You hot bastard.

26
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:36,240

Oh, you're ticklish?
Are you ticklish?

28
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,496
How's that?

29
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,374
Hey, wait.

Yeah.

32
00:02:49,962 --> 00:02:53,173

Much.

35
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,530

Morris can't figure out
how to work his zip--

44
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:52,269
l'll get to it in a second.

45
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,354
Happy Halloween.

52
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:09,995
Oh, God.

53
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,123
That one would be Mr. Fike.

54
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,251
Talk about being in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

55
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,837
Yeah.

56
00:06:19,546 --> 00:06:22,007
Hello.

57
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,636
- This is a nice lineup.
- Yeah--

58
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,806
You, uh, planning on some personal time
in the bathroom later?

59
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:32,768
Very funny.

60
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,020
Stop it.

61
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:37,105
No problem. lt's all good.

62
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,148
Rigiddero.

63
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,191
Yes, sir.

64
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:42,819
Not you. Your brother.

65
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,703
Any plans tonight?

66
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:54,832
l'm going to the carnival
with a few friends.

67
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,917
l'm guessing you heard about
the boys' murdered last night.

68
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:59,002
- The homosexuals.
- Yeah.

69
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,088
You didn't know them, did ya?

70
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:03,549
No.

71
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,301
Our community liaison

72
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:09,429
asked us to help get these out
around the neighbourhood for tonight.

73
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:13,600
l know your work here hasn't been
everything you wanted.

74
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:14,643
l wouldn't normally
ask you to do this,

75
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,771
but everyone's tied up with the carnival.

76
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,814
l could use your help.

77
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,942
Can l wear my dad's uniform?

78
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:25,070
lt's Halloween.

79
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:27,656
Yeah.

80
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,769
Hi.

81
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:18,040
l just love an ass in blue.

82
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,642
Come on.

83
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:17,724
Come on.
Let's finish this off.

84
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:37,494
Hey, l'm from the local
police department,

85
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,580
putting up signs about a local homicide.

86
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:43,750
- Do you mind if l put one in your store?
- Knock yourself out.

87
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,420
Thanks.

88
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:11,528
Oh, God.

89
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,659
Sorry.

90
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,499
Have a good one.

91
00:10:56,907 --> 00:10:58,825
Two guys got murdered last night.

92
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,954
Yeah, l was just reading that.

93
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,039
How'd he kill 'em?

94
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,124
We're not releasing that information.

95
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:11,380
lt could jeopardize the case
if details got out.

96
00:11:12,548 --> 00:11:15,509
So you guys are close
to catching him, then.

97
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,594
That keeps it lively.

98
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,680
l wouldn't worry about it.
Those cigarettes will kill you first.

99
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,765
l'm counting on it.

100
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:23,851
Well, l hope you

101
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:27,604
catch your man, officer.

102
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:35,320
The killer cut off their heads.

103
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,406
He cut off their heads,
and he took 'em.

104
00:11:37,573 --> 00:11:42,244
l think you just blew your investigation.

105
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:03,182
- Oh, yeah.
- That's good.

106
00:12:04,683 --> 00:12:06,602
Oh, fuck, it's a cop.

107
00:12:06,768 --> 00:12:07,644
lt's a cop.

108
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:10,564
Okay. Yeah.

109
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,528
Jesus.

110
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:20,157
Look at you. You look like you joined
the force. Very sharp.

111
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:21,200
Right. Right.

112
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,328
l'm 18. l swear. l can prove it.

113
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:26,413
Relax. He's no cop.
He's my roommate.

114
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,499
Look, if l was a cop,
l'd arrest you, okay?

115
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:32,669
You wouldn't stop frisking me
long enough to get the cuffs on.

116
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:35,797
All right, party's over.
Everyone out of my car.

117
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:39,760
Come here, baby.
All right.

118
00:12:40,135 --> 00:12:41,011
What's up?

119
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,096
Thank you so much.

120
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:46,225
l had a wonderful time.
lt was really good.

121
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:50,437
And l'll see you guys downtown.

122
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,652
So who were those two?

123
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,694
Some straight couple from Pasadena.

124
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:59,780
- Oh, great.
- ln town for the carnival.

125
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,865
- Where'd you meet 'em?
- Jesus, bro.

126
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:04,993
What's all the questions?
ln the diner.

127
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:08,121
You were late.
l got tired of waiting around.

128
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,250
Look, you really shouldn't be
doing that, okay?

129
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:14,378
l mean, two guys got murdered
in their car last night.

130
00:13:14,545 --> 00:13:16,463
No shit?
Were they boning each other?

131
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,549
Yes, Chaz, they were
boning each other.

132
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,677
- At least they died doing it, right?
- Oh, God.

133
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:23,762
Hey, Joey.

134
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,890
Hey, guys. Sorry. They're
finally letting me off.

135
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:32,104
Give me three minutes to change.
Three minutes.

136
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:38,360
Scored two hits of X for tonight.

137
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:41,488
- Give me a kiss, and l'll give you one.
- l'm not interested.

138
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:43,574
- Kiss me anyway?
- No way.

139
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,659
- Come on.
- No, sit down.

140
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:48,787
- Kiss me.
- No. Okay, okay. Funny.

141
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:51,915
- Come on!
- lf you're gonna make out in my booth,

142
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,001
you need to order something, guys.

143
00:13:54,168 --> 00:13:57,421
l'll have some pie.

144
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,197
Evening, gentlemen.

145
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:26,325
Don't touch the tits, but you can
feel the ass all you like.

146
00:14:26,491 --> 00:14:29,453
You've got the biggest set of balls.

147
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,538
Yes, l do.

148
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,709
And right now they are crammed
into a space about half their size.

149
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:38,837
Gentlemen, drag is both uncomfortable
and scary as shit.

150
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:41,965
Don't let the queens
tell you anything different.

151
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,051
What got into you?

152
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,136
l'm a sex symbol every day of the year.

153
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:49,264
l think a good girl deserves
a night off, don't you?

154
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:54,478
- Still look good to me, baby.
- Thanks, Chaz, but you'll eat anything.

155
00:14:54,645 --> 00:14:57,606
- You look lovely tonight, Tobey.
- Oh, aren't you sweet?

156
00:14:57,773 --> 00:14:59,691
Why don't you come here?
Take a picture with me.

157
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,819
Have fun tonight,
and bring back a man for me, will you?

158
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,905
We will.

159
00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:08,033
So l'm on a billboard in West Hollywood.
Ripped Boi Clothing.

160
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,118
- That's great.
- Our little supermodel.

161
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:13,247
Hey. Don't touch, don't touch.

162
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:16,375
l wanna get a picture
of me in front of the billboard.

163
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:17,417
We'll take a picture of me like this.

164
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:19,503
Send it to my mom for Christmas.

165
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,631
Can you imagine the look on
her face when she opens it?

166
00:15:22,798 --> 00:15:24,716
lt's gonna be hilarious.

167
00:15:24,883 --> 00:15:27,845
And l see you two didn't dress
for the holiday at all.

168
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,930
- My costume's in the car.
- And yours?

169
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:34,101
- Come on, l'm wearing it.
- Oh. Your dad's old work clothes.

170
00:15:34,268 --> 00:15:36,186
- Hey.
- Ready to go?

171
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,272
No, we're waiting for Joey.

172
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,357
Why don't you go get him?

173
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:45,571
l do not know how long
l can last in these heels.

174
00:15:45,737 --> 00:15:47,656
Hey, you seen Joey?

175
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:48,699
You can't be back here.

176
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:53,912
Oh, come on, it's Halloween.
Look, l'm a ghost.

177
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,040
He's back there,
and please, don't touch anything.

178
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,126
Joey?

179
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,671
Don't come back herel

180
00:16:03,463 --> 00:16:05,382
Are you okay?

181
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:07,801
No.

182
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:13,473
l'm stuck.

183
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,895
Are you sure jeans really go with this?

184
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:21,315
Yeah, l'm positive.

185
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:24,151
Where'd you get the costume?

186
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,279
Chaz loaned it to me.

187
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:30,407
l'm gonna get Jared Reynolds'
phone number tonight.

188
00:16:30,574 --> 00:16:34,495
Jared Reynolds, varsity jock.

189
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:37,706
l thought you already had his phone number.

190
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:38,749
Yeah, l have it,

191
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,920
but l need him to give it to me.

192
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:45,005
l have to get it tonight too.

193
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:49,176
l can't even eat anymore,
l think about him so much.

194
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:54,389
You're bound to get
someone's attention, right?

195
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:18,914
You look so butch, man.
lt looks great.

196
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:22,543
Damn, Joey, you're gonna be
breaking hearts all over town.

197
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,628
He better not get
in any trouble, all right?

198
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:26,713
Come on, in that outfit?

199
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,970
He's gonna be getting into so much trouble,
he'll be walking funny for three days.

200
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,055
- Here.
- What's this?

201
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:37,140
This is a padlock and a chain.

202
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:39,226
lf you don't come home tonight,
l'm losing the key,

203
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,354
and it's gonna take a welder
to get it off.

204
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:47,067
- You dick.
- Lighten up. l was joking.

205
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:51,738
lt does look kind of good, though.

206
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:55,909
- We are going out, and we're doing it.
- Yes, we are.

207
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,995
This is the one night of the year,
Halloween,

208
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:01,123
when you get to indulge your most
perverse and twisted fantasies,

209
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,208
and nobody cares.

210
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:04,251
Jared Reynolds.

211
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:07,379
- That's all l want.
- That has some potential.

212
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:10,507
- Hand me my costume back there, will ya?
- All right.

213
00:18:10,674 --> 00:18:11,550
So what about you, Chaz?

214
00:18:11,717 --> 00:18:15,721
You know me, man.
Life is meant for living.

215
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,849
- Hey, pass me the pants, too, yeah?
- Okay.

216
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:19,892
- No wait.
- Tobey, grab the wheel.

217
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,394
Yup.

218
00:18:23,187 --> 00:18:24,062
Okay.

219
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,148
- Oh, good Lord.
- Jesus.

220
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:30,319
- Gotta go commando if you wanna rodeo.
- Oh, come on.

221
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:34,489
What're you looking to get,
all dolled up in that dress and cheap wig?

222
00:18:34,656 --> 00:18:36,575
No, this wig is not cheap.

223
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:37,618
You looking to get laid?

224
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:41,788
No, no, no, we are not cruising
the trannie bars tonight, all right?

225
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:43,874
No, we're not,
and l'll tell you why.

226
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:45,959
Because l spent $300
getting this pretty tonight,

227
00:18:46,126 --> 00:18:48,045
and nothing, nobody is passing
through these lips,

228
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:50,130
no matter how big.

229
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:53,258
Okay? l am officially
removing myself from the race.

230
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,344
Oh, please.

231
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:58,472
You and you and you
can all thank me in the morning.

232
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,557
Don't worry about me.

233
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:03,685
Guys, check out this guy
on the bike here.

234
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:06,563
Oh, Jesus.

235
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,454
We're here.

236
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:25,582
Are you kidding me? You can't
park any closer than this?

237
00:19:25,749 --> 00:19:26,625
Why are we here?

238
00:19:26,792 --> 00:19:29,753
Eddie knows why we're here.

239
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,839
This is where it happened.

240
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,924
Less than 1 8 hours ago,

241
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:37,052
two gay guys were murdered
on this spot.

242
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:39,137
You're gonna make us
walk through the woods

243
00:19:39,304 --> 00:19:41,223
to go to the carnival

244
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,308
because a couple of queens
got killed here?

245
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,351
lt's Halloween.

246
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:46,436
That's a two-block hike.

247
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:47,479
Wuss.

248
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,565
l don't see you wearing heels.

249
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,650
You know, l saw
the crime scene photos.

250
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:53,735
- No way.
- Shut up.

251
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,821
What did they look like?

252
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:58,949
Two guys, just like us--
you know, 23, 22.

253
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,034
Yeah? Were they hot?

254
00:20:01,201 --> 00:20:02,077
l don't know.

255
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:06,165
They didn't have their heads.

256
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,419
One of the guys
was hanging outside the door.

257
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:13,547
There was blood dripping
all over the handle.

258
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,632
The other guy,

259
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:17,718
l guess they thought he'd be safe
underneath their car,

260
00:20:17,885 --> 00:20:21,889
so he curled up into a little ball
behind the tire.

261
00:20:22,055 --> 00:20:22,931
When the coroner pulled him out,

262
00:20:23,098 --> 00:20:26,059
he had to break his fingers
to get them off the axle.

263
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,145
That's kind of sweet, though.

264
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:29,188
Yeah. l don't know.

265
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,273
Whoever done it must have
been really strong

266
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,401
because their heads
were cut off so cleanly

267
00:20:34,568 --> 00:20:36,486
that none of the tubes,
the veins,

268
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,572
the arteries, the wind pipe,

269
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,700
they weren't crushed at all.

270
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:44,828
They were wide open.

271
00:20:44,995 --> 00:20:47,956
Speaking of air, can l
crack a fucking window?

272
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:50,042
Eddie used up
all the goddamn oxygen.

273
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,127
Nice story, Eddie.

274
00:20:52,294 --> 00:20:54,213
You're a man with brains.

275
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:57,341
What makes people kill like that?

276
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,426
Probably some 40-year-old
gay guy

277
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:00,469
that just came out
of the closet.

278
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:02,554
He's probably jealous
of all the nice hot guys

279
00:21:02,721 --> 00:21:04,640
like us walking around.

280
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:05,682
Shit. l mean, think about it.

281
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,768
Wouldn't you want to kill us?

282
00:21:07,935 --> 00:21:09,853
We're fucking fabulous.

283
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,981
No. lt's got to be
about his mother.

284
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:14,024
lt always is.

285
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,109
The real motive doesn't matter,

286
00:21:16,276 --> 00:21:19,238
because we're never gonna find out
what it is anyway.

287
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,323
lf there's one thing
l'm sure of,

288
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,366
it's that guy got on a train

289
00:21:22,533 --> 00:21:24,451
and took it back
to Louisiana or Oklahoma

290
00:21:24,618 --> 00:21:26,537
or whatever backwater swamp
his ass was spawned in.

291
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:29,665
He didn't stick around.

292
00:21:29,832 --> 00:21:31,750
God, shit!

293
00:21:31,917 --> 00:21:34,503
Damn it!

294
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,964
Get out of the fucking car.

295
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,092
- Damn it, get out of the car.
- l got you.

296
00:21:40,259 --> 00:21:43,220
l'm gonna beat your ass.
Get out of the fucking car.

297
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,263
Come here.

298
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:47,391
Get out of there.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

299
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:51,562
Jesus. You scared
the shit out of me.

300
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:53,647
That was hysterical.

301
00:21:53,814 --> 00:21:56,775
Hey, come on, guys. l know
a back way to the carnival.

302
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:58,861
Fuck.

303
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:00,946
So why do you take
somebody's head?

304
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:03,031
Killers like trophies.

305
00:22:03,198 --> 00:22:05,117
Maybe he couldn't get head
any other way.

306
00:22:05,284 --> 00:22:06,160
Oh, man.

307
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:08,245
l was just saying
what you guys were thinking.

308
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:09,288
Maybe he does sleep with them.

309
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:12,416
Jesus, Joey,
where's your goddamn brain?

310
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,544
You know the brain's
actually the largest sex organ?

311
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:17,629
Speak for yourself, dude.

312
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:19,715
Gentlemen, last time
to take a piss

313
00:22:19,882 --> 00:22:20,757
before the port-a-potties.

314
00:22:20,924 --> 00:22:24,678
- All right.
- Find a tree.

315
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,679
Joey.

316
00:23:07,846 --> 00:23:09,765
Joey, come here.

317
00:23:09,932 --> 00:23:12,893
Leave me alone. l can't pee
if you're talking to me.

318
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,978
Eddie, do you ever
stop nagging?

319
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:19,066
- Shut up. Come here.
- What?

320
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:23,320
There's someone
in the bushes right there.

321
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:25,405
What am l supposed to see?

322
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,950
Joey.

323
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,619
Joey, get back here
right now. Come on.

324
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:33,163
What?

325
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:37,918
- There's someone in the bushes?
- Yeah.

326
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:41,046
Holy shit. He was right by me.

327
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:46,051
He's cruising us.
He is totally cruising us.

328
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:47,302
What does he look like?

329
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:49,388
l don't know.
he's wearing a mask.

330
00:23:49,555 --> 00:23:52,516
Probably
for a very good reason.

331
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,601
Poor guy.

332
00:23:54,768 --> 00:23:56,687
Halloween's probably
the only night of the year

333
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,772
where he gets any action.

334
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,858
Good luck to you,
creepy cruiser.

335
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,900
l hope you get some.

336
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:05,028
Yeah, big boy.

337
00:24:07,281 --> 00:24:08,156
Damn!

338
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:10,242
Oh, man.

339
00:24:10,409 --> 00:24:12,327
Devil Daddy's got
some serious drag on.

340
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:14,413
Damn, what's he doing?

341
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:16,498
Oh, man, he's whipping it out.

342
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,626
Yeah, show us, Big Daddy.
Come on.

343
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,754
Here it comes.

344
00:24:23,964 --> 00:24:27,301
What's he got there?

345
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:30,053
That's a knife.

346
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:33,182
He's got a fucking knife,
the kinky bastard.

347
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:36,310
You are deranged, sir,
and l love it!

348
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,395
ls that all you got?
Give us some more.

349
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:41,523
ls your knife serrated?
You're making me hot, Big Daddy.

350
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:43,609
You guys are sick.

351
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:47,779
You want to see some? Come on,
big boy. You want to play?

352
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:50,741
Let's play.

353
00:24:54,203 --> 00:24:58,207

Where'd he go?

358
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:22,189
- He snubbed us?
- Are you kidding me?

359
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:25,317
Four perfect young naked asses?

360
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:28,445
Who walks away from that?

361
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:32,199
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, shit!

362
00:26:16,577 --> 00:26:19,538

363
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:21,623
Hey. Hey, guys,

365
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:30,966
Devil Daddy knows a good thing
when he sees it.

366
00:26:31,175 --> 00:26:35,012
Hold on. l need my gift bag.

367
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:46,273
Bye-bye.

00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,246
Mine's got pineapple.

370
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:03,332
Pineapple, pineapple.

371
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,417
This is all crap.

372
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:08,545
You guys get CDs?
Glow sticks?

373
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:10,631
Why do they make green condoms?

374
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:14,801
l want to know
who sucks a green dick.

375
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:20,015
l got a scratch-and-sniff
for The Manhole Cover.

376
00:27:20,182 --> 00:27:23,143
Hey, let's go get drunk, man.

One swallow, you're hooked.

384
00:27:43,121 --> 00:27:45,040
Hey, copper.

385
00:27:45,207 --> 00:27:48,544
You, uh, fraternize?

386
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,549
We come as a set.

387
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:10,065

388
00:28:10,232 --> 00:28:14,236
Sure you don't want the other one?
lt'll bring you luck.

389
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:17,114
All right.

390
00:28:27,958 --> 00:28:30,919
Motorcycle. No helmet.

391
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:33,005
Hangs out at the leather club.

392
00:28:33,172 --> 00:28:35,090
And he smokes.

393
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,218
- You like him?
- He's hot.

394
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:43,432
Yeah, hot in the ''l'm gonna beat you
with a baseball bat'' kind of way.

395
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,560
l don't get it with you and this
rough trade fixation.

396
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,645
Every good boy's got his kink.

397
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:50,731
l just never thought
he was the type.

398
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,859
You get in there,
and you get him.

399
00:28:54,026 --> 00:28:55,944
l'm not like you, all right?

400
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,030
No, but you want to be. So go.

401
00:28:58,197 --> 00:29:01,533
We're with you here.

402
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,329
All right, come on.

403
00:29:05,496 --> 00:29:09,750
l'm not going in there.
Look at me.

404
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:18,884
Yeah, they could make this place
any scarier than it already is.

405
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:23,889
Stick with us, all right?
Safety in numbers.

406
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,318
Hey.

407
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,361
l saw you today.

408
00:30:19,528 --> 00:30:22,489
At the tattoo shop?

409
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:24,575
We talked about the murders.

410
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:25,617
Do you remember?

411
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:26,660
Yeah, l remember.

412
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,745
Yeah. Hey, l'm Eddie.

413
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:31,874
What do you want?

414
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,959
l'd like to know your name.

415
00:30:34,126 --> 00:30:37,087
l'll tell you what, all right?
Do l have a stalker?

416
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:39,173
Because l know you're
definitely not a real cop.

417
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:42,301
You know, it's Halloween.

418
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,386
My handcuffs are real.

419
00:30:44,553 --> 00:30:46,471
Right on.

420
00:30:46,638 --> 00:30:49,600
Unfortunately,
you have no gun.

421
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,685
No, l left it at home.

422
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:54,813
So you do shoot, then.

423
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,941
Yeah, l do, a little.

424
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:01,862
l used to shoot, because...

425
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:06,283
l wanted to be a cop,
but l didn't...

426
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,411
l didn't pass the physical.

427
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:12,539
No, l hurt my eye.

428
00:31:12,706 --> 00:31:14,625
- Your eye looks fine.
- lt's not.

429
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,753
My field of vision is gone.

430
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,838
My depth perception is shot.

431
00:31:20,005 --> 00:31:21,924
l can't even drive.

432
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,009
You don't hit on guys
much, do you?

433
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,470
No.

434
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:32,351
Look, l'm Jake.

435
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:35,479
What changed your mind?

436
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:39,358
l wanted to see you shoot.

437
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,931
What's up, little pig?

438
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,016
You like toys?

439
00:32:13,183 --> 00:32:15,102
Paddles? Plugs?

440
00:32:15,269 --> 00:32:18,230
l could really train
a young boy like you.

441
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:20,315
Hey, big boy, why don't you
back off, huh?

442
00:32:20,482 --> 00:32:22,401

00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:47,573
Listen, we're all supposed
to go to breakfast tomorrow.

530
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:53,036
l could ditch them
if l had a better offer.

531
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:56,540
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

532
00:40:58,709 --> 00:41:03,881
l gotta get back. We're gonna
go to another club.

533
00:41:06,008 --> 00:41:08,719
Come here.

534
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:17,477
l want to remember you this time.

535
00:41:39,374 --> 00:41:41,293
So...tomorrow?

536
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:44,087
Oh, yeah.

537
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:50,052
Hey.

538
00:41:51,887 --> 00:41:55,891
This isn't my costume.
l borrowed this.

539
00:41:56,058 --> 00:41:56,934
That's okay.

540
00:41:57,100 --> 00:42:00,938
Don't give it back just yet.

541
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,539
Never seen a cock block
like that in my life.

542
00:43:00,706 --> 00:43:02,624
You've never seen a cock, period.

543
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:05,752
Gorgeous, you are
a walking hard-on.

544
00:43:05,919 --> 00:43:07,838
My virgin ears.

545
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:12,009
Please, girl, your ears are
all the virgin you got left.

546
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:14,761
Oh, my--

547
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:18,724
That is so not funny.

548
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:25,564
Why don't we shoot for something?

549
00:43:25,731 --> 00:43:27,649
- Make it interesting.
- Like what?

550
00:43:27,816 --> 00:43:28,692
Winner chooses.

551
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,777
Okay. You're on.

552
00:43:30,944 --> 00:43:32,863
All right. l need a drink.

553
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,991
l'll see you at the arcade later.

554
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:39,912
What's the matter with him?

555
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:44,333
Pink flamingo.

556
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,760
Thanks.

557
00:43:54,927 --> 00:43:57,262
Hey.

558
00:44:07,439 --> 00:44:10,400
For once, it would be
nice to find a man

559
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:12,486
who wants me for what's in here

560
00:44:12,653 --> 00:44:14,571
instead of what's down here.

561
00:44:14,738 --> 00:44:17,783
Say it, sister.

562
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:43,767
Not a bad shot.

563
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,853
''Not a bad shot,'' he says.

564
00:44:46,019 --> 00:44:46,895
Why don't you
take a look at that?

565
00:44:47,062 --> 00:44:50,023
lt's your turn. l'm gonna
take care of him.

566
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:53,610
Here's three tickets.

567
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:58,240
You nervous?

568
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,664
You want to aim
at your target right there.

569
00:45:05,831 --> 00:45:07,749
Right there.

570
00:45:07,916 --> 00:45:10,878
You're gonna make me
shoot that kid.

571
00:45:11,044 --> 00:45:12,963
No, l'm not. You're not
gonna hurt anybody.

572
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:16,091
Just point your gun...right there.

573
00:45:16,258 --> 00:45:17,134
Yeah?

574
00:45:17,301 --> 00:45:20,262
Watch the target there.

575
00:45:20,429 --> 00:45:23,390
Here it comes.

576
00:45:23,557 --> 00:45:26,018
Shoot.

577
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:46,663
You are right.
You are a lousy shot.

578
00:46:10,479 --> 00:46:12,898
Yeah!

579
00:46:13,607 --> 00:46:15,526
We're going to help her out.
We're gonna help you guys--

580
00:46:15,692 --> 00:46:17,611
- Hi, fellas.
- Hey, buddy. How you doing?

581
00:46:17,778 --> 00:46:19,696
Where's the rest
of our posse, huh?

582
00:46:19,863 --> 00:46:22,991
They're this way.

583
00:46:30,290 --> 00:46:31,166
Hey.

584
00:46:31,333 --> 00:46:33,252
Where have you been?

585
00:46:33,418 --> 00:46:35,337
You guys have gotta
try some of this.

586
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:37,422
Where's Joey?

587
00:46:37,589 --> 00:46:40,551
He's fine, man. His little
jock friend showed up.

588
00:46:40,717 --> 00:46:44,721
Joined him in the bathroom,
if you know what l mean.

589
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:47,850
Hey, what happened?

590
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:52,020
l gave them their space, you know?

591
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:53,063
You just left them there?

592
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,191
Jesus, Eddie, let the kid
live a little, you know?

593
00:46:56,358 --> 00:46:58,277
- Come here.
- Whoa.

594
00:46:58,443 --> 00:47:00,362
lf you ever get
this guy into bed,

595
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:03,490
he's gonna fucking explode.

596
00:47:03,657 --> 00:47:06,618
Come on, baby.

597
00:47:21,383 --> 00:47:23,302
All right, look,
we can get Joey,

598
00:47:23,468 --> 00:47:25,387
but let me get a hot dog.
Do you want one?

599
00:47:25,554 --> 00:47:26,430
No, l'm okay.

600
00:47:26,597 --> 00:47:28,515
One dog, please.

601
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:31,643
l really do want
to go look for Joey.

602
00:47:31,810 --> 00:47:33,729
That little fucker's
with his dream boy.

603
00:47:33,896 --> 00:47:35,814
Excuse me.

604
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,942
Yeah, l know, but even still...

605
00:47:39,109 --> 00:47:42,070
Look, you don't have
to come with me.

606
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:44,156
Are you blowing me off?

607
00:47:44,323 --> 00:47:46,241
No, l just--
l mean, you want to come?

608
00:47:46,408 --> 00:47:48,327
Okay, yeah.

609
00:47:48,494 --> 00:47:49,369
Can we find him?

610
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:52,498
Okay, 30 minutes, only 30 minutes,
and we'll go do something else.

611
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:53,540
My motorcycle's
there anyway. Let's go.

612
00:47:53,707 --> 00:47:55,626
Fine.

613
00:47:55,792 --> 00:47:59,505
- Bye, Tobey.
- Fine. Bye.

614
00:48:13,519 --> 00:48:16,480
Where'd you get a set
of legs like that, baby?

615
00:48:16,647 --> 00:48:19,191
Soccer.

616
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:42,548
l hear he's got a huge cock.

617
00:48:42,714 --> 00:48:45,676
You know he does.

618
00:48:45,843 --> 00:48:47,761
Take my picture?

619
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:50,347
Sure.

620
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:54,017
Nice. Yeah.

621
00:48:54,184 --> 00:48:57,145
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

622
00:48:57,312 --> 00:48:59,231
Am l beautiful?
Tell me l'm beautiful.

623
00:48:59,398 --> 00:49:01,316
Gorgeous.

624
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,528
Awesome. Great.

625
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:13,704
So where you guys going, huh?

626
00:49:15,038 --> 00:49:16,957
Oh, my God.

627
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:20,711
l look just like my mom.

628
00:52:22,726 --> 00:52:25,771
l'm okay. Okay.

629
00:52:26,897 --> 00:52:31,068
l don't need the calories anyway.

630
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:41,745
Hey.

631
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,499
Hey.

632
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,001
Hey.

633
00:52:56,093 --> 00:52:58,720
Hey. Hey.

634
00:52:59,221 --> 00:53:01,640
Wait.

635
00:53:03,392 --> 00:53:06,353
l know you, right?

636
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,481
You've been following us
ever since the park.

637
00:53:09,648 --> 00:53:14,194
So, which one of us
are you after, huh?

638
00:53:14,862 --> 00:53:17,823
Before you answer,
let me just warn you,

639
00:53:17,990 --> 00:53:19,908
l'm the only one left.

640
00:53:20,075 --> 00:53:24,079
My other roommates seem
to have dates for the night.

641
00:53:24,246 --> 00:53:30,294
Turns out my girlie costume here
isn't turning very many heads.

642
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,506
Hey.

643
00:53:34,673 --> 00:53:36,592
l like your costume.

644
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:39,720
You work out, right?
l can tell.

645
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:43,223
You play any sports?

646
00:53:44,057 --> 00:53:47,519
What gym do you go to?

647
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:51,190
What, you've got
enough candy already?

648
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:55,360
You couldn't use a little more?

649
00:53:55,527 --> 00:53:57,446
l don't always look
like this, you know.

650
00:53:57,613 --> 00:54:00,574
You superficial faggotl

651
00:54:00,741 --> 00:54:03,702
lt's Halloween. Jesus!

652
00:54:03,869 --> 00:54:06,830
God, here, look!

653
00:54:06,997 --> 00:54:10,334
My driver's license.

654
00:54:15,339 --> 00:54:18,550
lt's not bad, huh?

655
00:54:19,510 --> 00:54:24,056
Tobey Weatherton,
1 126 Hollywood Lane.

656
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:27,559
Hair, brown.

657
00:54:28,894 --> 00:54:30,813
Eyes, hazel.

658
00:54:30,979 --> 00:54:33,690
Sex, male.

659
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,844
l'm never doing drag again.

660
00:55:10,602 --> 00:55:13,564
The club's closed.

661
00:55:13,730 --> 00:55:17,734
Listen, l was just here.
My--l need to get inside.

662
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:19,820
That's always how it is, isn't it?

663
00:55:19,987 --> 00:55:22,948
lsn't it? You know?
Look, you don't understand.

664
00:55:23,115 --> 00:55:25,033
My motorcycle was parked
out here. The bouncer--

665
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,076
lt's a crime scene, buddy.

666
00:55:26,243 --> 00:55:28,162
Kid fell apart in there.
You're not getting in.

667
00:55:28,328 --> 00:55:30,581
No?

668
00:55:41,884 --> 00:55:44,303
Jake!

669
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:54,730
Jake.

670
00:56:00,652 --> 00:56:03,071
Jake.

671
00:56:22,549 --> 00:56:24,968
Jake.

672
00:56:42,361 --> 00:56:44,279
What the hell you doing
over there, man?

673
00:56:44,446 --> 00:56:46,365
You're gonna get
busted by that cop.

674
00:56:46,532 --> 00:56:48,450
l thought you were gonna get busted.

675
00:56:48,617 --> 00:56:51,578
You came here to save me, huh?

676
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:56,708
Maybe later, tough guy.
Let's get out of here.

677
00:57:02,172 --> 00:57:04,091
Here, let me help you out.

678
00:57:04,258 --> 00:57:06,176
Here we go.

679
00:57:06,343 --> 00:57:07,219
- Ready?
- All right.

680
00:57:07,386 --> 00:57:10,347
Okay. All right. You know what?

681
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:12,432
There's a gate down there.
Why don't you go through the club?

682
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,561
Go walk around. l'll meet you
up front, all right?

683
00:57:15,727 --> 00:57:17,646
Sorry.

684
00:57:17,813 --> 00:57:22,359
-That your buddy or something?
- Where?

685
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:26,989
Jesus Christ.

686
00:58:24,546 --> 00:58:26,465
Come on, man.

687
00:58:26,632 --> 00:58:31,303
Get out your gunl
He had a fucking knife.

688
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:40,020
So on the back, there's
nerves that are connected

689
00:58:40,187 --> 00:58:42,105
to make it turn around,
and the nerves got cut.

690
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:43,148
So that's all.

691
00:58:43,315 --> 00:58:46,276
Everything's really okay.

692
00:58:46,443 --> 00:58:48,362
All right, l've got to go.

693
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:52,533
All right, wait a second, whoa.

694
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:54,618
What?

695
00:58:54,785 --> 00:58:57,746
Don't let them turn this
into a fag-bashing, okay?

696
00:58:57,913 --> 00:59:03,252
Because it would ruin me
around here, you know that.

697
00:59:04,169 --> 00:59:07,422
Don't kid yourself.

698
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:33,198
Hey, man.

699
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:35,284
Just wanted to see
how your eye was.

700
00:59:35,450 --> 00:59:36,326
lt's fine.

701
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:38,912
Yeah.

702
00:59:43,792 --> 00:59:47,129
That happen tonight?

703
00:59:49,006 --> 00:59:53,010
Look, l jammed my eye
on a piece of pipe,

704
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:58,223
and when l woke up in
the hospital, my eye was gone.

705
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:01,351
They had relieved me
from my police training,

706
01:00:01,518 --> 01:00:05,355
due to a medical disability.

707
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:08,650
l'm gonna get out of here.

You got a key to these?
