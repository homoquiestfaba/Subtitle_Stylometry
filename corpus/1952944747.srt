1
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,330
Hi.

2
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,707
Hi.

3
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:51,630
Have we met
somewhere before?

4
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:54,591
Mm-hm, I don't
think so.

5
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,343
Mm.

6
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,013
Ah.

7
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:02,099
Late.

8
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,227
Very late, Anna. You put
the alarm back again.

9
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,108
<i>Stautenmeyer is calling
into the office this morning.</i>

10
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:14,444
<i>We're gonna talk to them
about making me partner.</i>

11
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:16,780
Wow. That's amazing.

12
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:20,909
Yeah, you're gonna have to work
on being a little more corporate.

13
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,202
Yeah, work on this.

14
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,579
Jesus!
Not funny.

15
00:03:24,663 --> 00:03:26,707
Ha ha.

16
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,835
In other news, the serial killer
now known as Tearjerk Jack...

17
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:33,046
<i>continues to spread terror
across the East Side.</i>

18
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,674
<i>Police have verified the
discovery of a fifth victim...</i>

19
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,801
<i>in the early hours
this morning.</i>

20
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,096
We will continue to follow
the story for you as develop...

21
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:45,475
Shouldn't you be handing out gold stars
instead of earning yellow ribbons on FarmVille?

22
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:48,979
I was just checking
pre-delays in the subway.

23
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:56,778
What do you think?

24
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:59,197
I like it a little
rough, but I guess...

25
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:02,784
Mr. Stautenmeyer
likes his men a little different.

26
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,578
No, he does
like it smooth.

27
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:27,517
<i>Next stop.</i>

28
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:34,357
<i>"A chance encounter
with a mysterious stranger...</i>

29
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,111
<i>could be a bridge to new
exciting opportunities."</i>

30
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:45,368
<i>Wow, that looks
like modern art.</i>

31
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:47,996
It's a little Picasso
we've got going over here.

32
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,708
<i>Whoa.</i>

33
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:55,212
Oh, no. It's so
not a big deal.

34
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:58,715
Why don't we get a sponge from
over there and clean it up, okay?

35
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:01,009
All right.

36
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,188
Okay, got it.

37
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:17,317
Woo! Woo!

38
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,236
I got you.

39
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:22,447
Oh, no, you got me.
Oh, no, you got me.

40
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,699
Hello. I am here
to pick up...

41
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,701
Robert. He's
in the sandpit.

42
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh, you're good. I don't
know how you tell them apart.

43
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:34,709
Hello!

44
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,379
<i>Hi, Supernanny. Any hunklicio us divorcee to report...</i>

45
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,756
<i>or are you too busy
potty-training their offspring?</i>

46
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,426
You're so bad. I'm still
on the clock, you know.

47
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,428
So, are you
coming today?

48
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:48,265
<i>Yeah, it's Tuesday, right?
You bet your ass I am.</i>

49
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,227
<i>No, I'd rather
drink the calories.</i>

50
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,479
Mm, six-and-a-half.

51
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,940
Not too bad.
I would say seven.

52
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,485
Look left
to the bar. Quick.

53
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,905
<i>Ten out of ten. Not too shabby.
Not too shabby at all.</i>

54
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,324
I wouldn't kick him out
of bed for eating crackers.

55
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,244
<i>Or anything else.</i>

56
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,329
Does that matter?

57
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:15,750
Okay. So, I wanna know how was
Justin Timberlake last week?

58
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:19,838
Hm. Had a few drinks.
Went back to his...

59
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,591
Need I elaborate?

60
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:25,552
I had more fun
with a broken vibrator.

61
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,472
Does it ever get tiring, being a slut?

62
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,725
<i>I'll tell you one thing
you never get tired of.</i>

63
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,228
That moment when you wake
up and for a second...

64
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:39,649
you have no idea where you are or
who the hell the guy is next to you.

65
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,735
<i>I live
for that stuff</i>

66
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,613
I guess it complicates things
a little bit less, right?

67
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:46,031
Yeah.

68
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:47,616
I mean, sometimes with Bryce...

69
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,409
No, enough with Bryce.

70
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,369
If you're done with
him, just hand him over.

71
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,997
<i>Come on, girls.
Big smiles.</i>

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,166
Just think
in three months...

73
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,377
we will be sipping those dirty
martinis on Laguna Beach.

74
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:04,841
Hey, guys, I was... I wanted to tell you, but, um...

75
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,011
I don't think I'm gonna be
able to make it this year.

76
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:09,220
<i>What?</i>

77
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:10,347
It's sacred.

78
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,223
It's a ritual.

79
00:07:12,307 --> 00:07:14,184
I know. It's just Bryce
wants to take us to Vegas...

80
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,645
to celebrate our
first year and stuff.

81
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,188
Classy.

82
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,856
He's so gonna
pop the question.

83
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,233
Okay, listen, we just
moved in together.

84
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:26,237
And what are you waiting for? Get
dumped for some skanky-ass cheerleader?

85
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:30,200
If he pulls out a ring,
you should snatch it, girl.

86
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,243
Thank you.

87
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:34,746
You know, once you've squeezed
out a couple of rug-rats...

88
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,166
<i>you'll fix up some money pit and
slide contentedly into senility.</i>

89
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,752
<i>Francine, for
a second there...</i>

90
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,129
I forgot why
you're still single.

91
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,762
Oh, my God, you guys.

92
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:54,224
Mister "Ten-Out-of-Ten" over
there is totally checking me out.

93
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:59,646
<i>Oh, well, no sense in
letting him go to waste.</i>

94
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,898
Another drink.

95
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,109
Yeah, I know, it's cool.
I mean, he's not hot at all.

96
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,361
I mean, he's certainly
not my type.

97
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,866
<i>Excuse me, between
my nose and my rack...</i>

98
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,202
which do you think
I should get done first?

99
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,413
Major alcoholic. She's
got problems. Come on.

100
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,873
I'm sorry.
Wilcox and Third, please.

101
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,834
Get in.
I'll drive you home.

102
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,795
It's okay. Unlike some
people I know, I can walk.

103
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,880
<i>Are you getting in or what?</i>

104
00:08:33,388 --> 00:08:34,973
<i>Hey, ma'am, lookout!</i>

105
00:08:38,977 --> 00:08:40,520
Hey, check it out.

106
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,939
No!

107
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:26,960
<i>Anna? Anna!</i>

108
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,900
Will she be okay?

109
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,237
Somebody tell me. They ran
all the tests again this morning.

110
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:03,538
<i>Look, she's waking up.</i>

111
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,832
Anna?

112
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,169
Anna, can you hear me?

113
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:15,216
<i>- Hey, chica, we're here.
- Are you okay?</i>

114
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,017
Who are you?

115
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,604
Anna, it's me.
It's Bryce.

116
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,983
Oh, my head.

117
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,193
You're fine.

118
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,111
My head hurts.

119
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,573
Nothing is broken. You are
a blue-eyed miracle, kid.

120
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,826
Don't. Don't touch me.

121
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,287
Who are you?

122
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,039
<i>It's us, chica.</i>

123
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,917
<i>Hey, don't you
recognize us?</i>

124
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,131
<i>Anna? You've been
unconscious for over a week.</i>

125
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,800
Doctor.
He's not Bryce.

126
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,136
It's okay, Anna.
Calm down.

127
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:03,348
<i>i's not him. it's
not Bryce. I know Bryce.</i>

128
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,850
Anna, you just need to
relax. You need some rest.

129
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,436
<i>You got a nasty
bump on your head.</i>

130
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:09,812
It's all right, Anna.

131
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,856
Please, l-l
don't need that.

132
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,234
Anna!

133
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,027
Don't touch me.

134
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,613
Don't touch me!

135
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,824
Anna! Anna, wait.

136
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,409
She's confused.

137
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,334
Do you think she's okay?

138
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,295
It's okay.

139
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,718
<i>Anna, sweetheart.</i>

140
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,345
<i>Open the door.</i>

141
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,889
<i>Anna, it's me.</i>

142
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,433
Okay. Okay.

143
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:49,269
Sh, sh.

144
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,081
Take a close look
at this, please.

145
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,468
<i>And this one?</i>

146
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,054
Is that the same
face you see?

147
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,142
No.

148
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,561
<i>Both photos are
of the same man.</i>

149
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,651
<i>What you are experiencing
are symptoms of prosopagnosia.</i>

150
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,653
Sorry, proso-what?

151
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,156
<i>Prosopagnosia
or face blindness.</i>

152
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,742
<i>It-it's an impairment
in face perception...</i>

153
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,161
<i>caused by a lesion
on the temporal lobe.</i>

154
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,331
It's this part of the brain
that allows us in a nanosecond...

155
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:54,917
to compare someone's face with all
of the faces stored in our memory.

156
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:56,919
You wanna dumb it down
a little bit, Doc?

157
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,130
<i>Every time you look
at someone's face...</i>

158
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:03,259
it's as if you've never seen them
before. Even someone close to you.

159
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,971
Even your
own reflection.

160
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,351
However, confirmed cases of
prosopagnosia are extremely rare.

161
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:15,480
Anna is probably suffering
a slight cerebral shock.

162
00:14:15,605 --> 00:14:19,525
If the symptoms persist, you'll
need to see another specialist...

163
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:21,694
for a second opinion.

164
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,034
Twenty-dollar
words for stuff...

165
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,371
they know nothing about.
Psychiatrists for ya.

166
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,797
I had the place cleaned
for when you came back.

167
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,965
Thank you.

168
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,224
You know, I really thought
I was gonna lose you there.

169
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,559
Come here.

170
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:02,276
So, are you getting
used to my new looks?

171
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,571
Are they an
improvement at least?

172
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,282
Yeah, I mean...no.

173
00:15:08,366 --> 00:15:11,119
Y-you look great.

174
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:15,331
You see?
It's not all bad.

175
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,250
It'll pass.

176
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,211
And everything will go
back to the way that it was.

177
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:24,424
Hey, at least some
things never change.

178
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,594
Oh, that'll be
your dad.

179
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,974
He's been calling non-stop on
some crackly line from Argentina.

180
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:37,186
<i>Hello.
Uh, no.</i>

181
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,647
I just brought her home.

182
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,858
No, I understand but...

183
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,944
If you want.

184
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:46,988
Okay, I'll bring her in.

185
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:49,532
All right.

186
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,784
<i>Hey.</i>

187
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,494
Hey.

188
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:55,830
Everything okay?

189
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,292
Yeah.

190
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:02,837
Who was that?

191
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,382
It was just the police. Some
detective. He keeps calling.

192
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:09,218
He wants to take
your statement. Now.

193
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:20,021
Guess you put a
pretty good fight, huh?

194
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,401
How do you know that?

195
00:16:25,485 --> 00:16:27,445
I called your cell.

196
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:31,282
On the bridge, remember?
I heard things.

197
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,577
I'm the one who
called the police.

198
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,882
<i>Any more internal
memos end up in the Tribune...</i>

199
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,426
<i>I'll personally tear the
son of a bitch a new ass hole.</i>

200
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,095
Miss Marchant, correct?
How's the head?

201
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:54,722
You're the boyfriend?

202
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,015
Yeah. Bryce.

203
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,767
I'm Kerrest.
This way.

204
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:00,478
Watch your step.

205
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,813
Oh, I'm so sorry.

206
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:06,317
Oh, don't go in. Just sign
this before you do anything.

207
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,527
Oh, you're wearing
that pretty blue tie.

208
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,112
Thank you.

209
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:13,991
Would you change this
goddamn cell phone ring?

210
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:17,703
Why don't you just figure it out
yourself, you freaking loser.

211
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,249
A pasta bracelet. It's all
we found on the bridge.

212
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:26,337
No bag, no phone. Are you
sure they didn't fall with you?

213
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,923
I'm gonna ask you not to
cancel your cell phone contract.

214
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,134
The asshole's probably not stupid
enough to use it, but you never know.

215
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,387
So you really think
that it's him?

216
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:39,058
He killed, raped, and wept over the
corpse. You must know how he works.

217
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,394
He's been front page
news for six months now.

218
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,688
They even have
a snappy name for him.

219
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,940
Tearjerk Jack.

220
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,945
So, are you
gonna protect her?

221
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:53,489
This, my friend...

222
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,909
is what we have to wade through
just to request police protection.

223
00:17:56,993 --> 00:18:00,162
<i>Twenty of these get dumped on
the Chief's desk every morning.</i>

224
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:05,042
Cops parked outside your
house 24/7 scarfing doughnuts.

225
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,670
Strictly 911 territory.

226
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,924
He's got my papers.
He's got my address.

227
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,928
<i>And he's not stupid enough to go after
the one person who can recognize him, right?</i>

228
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,729
Look...

229
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:28,941
I'm sorry you had to
meet this year's whackjob.

230
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:37,033
You wanna feel safe?

231
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,160
Help me catch
the son of a bitch.

232
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,749
What do you got
for me here?

233
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,461
Thirty-five, forty,
tall, dark?

234
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:51,672
I'm not letting you out of here
until you give me more than this.

235
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,634
Did you or did you
not see his face?

236
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,929
Did you or did you
not see his face?

237
00:18:59,013 --> 00:19:00,389
Yes, I did.

238
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:02,224
Good. We're
getting somewhere.

239
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:06,187
Here. Look these
over carefully.

240
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,440
<i>Take your time.</i>

241
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:14,278
<i>This is bullshit! Miss Marchant, you
haven't even looked at half of these.</i>

242
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:17,239
I can't remember his face,
okay? Since the accident...

243
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,116
Anna, just... sh.

244
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,619
She just got out of the
hospital. She needs rest.

245
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:26,374
Rest? You go tell that to the six women
whose throat he cut from ear to ear!

246
00:19:26,457 --> 00:19:28,584
I apologize if I'm
rattling your cage...

247
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:33,214
but I'd rather the next time we
meet you weren't lying on a slab.

248
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,218
I can't recognize faces
anymore. Do you understand?

249
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,353
Since the accident I...

250
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,944
That-that man could be right in
front of me and I wouldn't know it.

251
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,863
Please, don't waste your
time trying to scare me...

252
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:00,783
because I am.
I already am.

253
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,623
Call the hospital.
They'll explain.

254
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:12,503
<i>Hey, Nicky.</i>

255
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,974
Lanyon, I've been trying to
reach you for the last two hours.

256
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,768
Man, it's Wednesday.
Nicholas. No cell.

257
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,396
Guess who just woke
up and walked in?

258
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:31,897
Anna Marchant.

259
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,276
Dammit, not a
diet Pepsi.

260
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:40,489
So, what's the story?
You got any leads?

261
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,575
Can we talk?

262
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:47,121
So, this
face blindness...

263
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,081
is it temporary
or permanent?

264
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,084
They have no
freaking idea.

265
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:58,340
You think
it's funny?

266
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:02,094
Well, she's the only one who's seen
him, and she can't recognize anybody?

267
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,847
You gotta admit
it's pretty far out.

268
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,563
How's the kid doing?

269
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,193
<i>He still hasn't
uttered a word.</i>

270
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:24,325
We have no lead, no ID.
Jorgensen in forensics...

271
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,702
even pushed a trace
on the tear sample...

272
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:29,371
<i>through the Feds'
DNA database. Nada.</i>

273
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,041
The guy is
a freaking ghost.

274
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:35,669
You're the mind reader
with the fancy diploma.

275
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,922
You know what I think?

276
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:41,342
The guy has to kill women to be
able to touch them. Well, that's sad.

277
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,219
The melancholy
killer theory?

278
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:47,014
I mean, come on. You gotta
give me more than that.

279
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,644
He weeps because his sexual
compulsions disgust him. He...

280
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,522
he only kills so they won't
see him as he truly is.

281
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:01,278
Anna Marchant
saw him.

282
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:07,618
Yeah, and she-she survived. I think
he's gonna be really interested in her.

283
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,121
Let me head down the Mission. Have another
crack at that hobo who fished her out.

284
00:22:11,205 --> 00:22:14,333
Good luck. We got nothing
out of him but sea shanties.

285
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,631
Hey, there.

286
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,800
Have we met
somewhere before?

287
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:09,263
Hey.

288
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,473
I'm sorry.

289
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,435
It was just
a bad dream.

290
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,520
Hey, it's okay.

291
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:22,192
Look, they need me at the
office this morning but...

292
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:24,320
Now, if you
want, I can...

293
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,989
No, it's okay. I'm...

294
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,824
I'm fine.

295
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:30,409
Are you sure?

296
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:31,911
Hey.

297
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,347
Hey.

298
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,641
You gave me quite
a ride, old boy.

299
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:55,851
Why weren't you down
at the Mission?

300
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:58,437
It's dirty there.

301
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:03,067
Might not be the Savoy
but at least it's safe.

302
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,861
Anything could happen
to you down here.

303
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,198
And what
do you care, huh?

304
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:17,915
I got some questions and this
time I really need the answers.

305
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:21,794
<i>The soonest I can get out
is on Tuesday's red eye from Buenos Aires.</i>

306
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:24,546
<i>Look, I'll take you to
dinner. I'll spoil you rotten.</i>

307
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,715
Well, that sounds great. You know what?

308
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,468
Why don't you come meet me at
school? I start back on Wednesday.

309
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,595
<i>Okay, any delays
I'll call you.</i>

310
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,431
Can you call me on Bryce's
Blackberry? Do you have that number?

311
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,141
<i>I have it, I have it. Now listen...</i>

312
00:24:36,225 --> 00:24:38,185
<i>I wish I could've
been there for you.</i>

313
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:40,396
It's okay, Dad. I love you, okay?
I'll see you then.

314
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,231
<i>I love you, too, Snowflake. Bye.</i>

315
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,649
Bye.

316
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,636
Hello.

317
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,683
<i>It's us, chica.
Open up!</i>

318
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:21,603
Hi, Sleeping Beauty.

319
00:25:21,687 --> 00:25:23,897
Know who we
are this time?

320
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,150
Oh, yeah.
I mean, absolutely.

321
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:29,695
<i>I was just really
zoned out last time.</i>

322
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,530
I mean, I'm...

323
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,866
really fine.

324
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:37,536
Well, look. You made
the front page.

325
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:39,538
<i>You're famous, bebe.</i>

326
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,126
God, I got away.

327
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,633
Oh, my God.

328
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,304
In heaven there's no beer.
Let's drink it all right here.

329
00:25:55,554 --> 00:26:00,100
In heaven there's no beer.
Let's drink it all right here!

330
00:26:00,184 --> 00:26:03,604
Look who's back.
Hello, handsome.

331
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,314
You feel
like remembering?

332
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:07,816
There's a two-six
in it for ya. Right?

333
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:14,323
Oh. I'll call you.

334
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,325
Or I'll text you.

335
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,459
Martinis at 11 a.m.

336
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,003
It's almost midnight
in Shanghai.

337
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,838
Just drink up.

338
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:32,382
Nina, you did
not just post that pic.

339
00:26:32,466 --> 00:26:34,843
I look squinty.
No, no, delete

340
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,011
I don't think so!

341
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,013
<i>Por favor.</i>

342
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,407
I'll be right back.

343
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,952
<i>Okay, chica.</i>

344
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,889
Hello.

345
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,558
Hey.

346
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,518
What do you want now?

347
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,872
Do you see anything?

348
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,501
No.

349
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:54,590
<i>Just reminds me of Europe
After the Rain by Max Ernst.</i>

350
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,258
I'm sorry?

351
00:27:56,341 --> 00:28:00,637
So, what was I supposed
to see exactly?

352
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:04,224
Well, l-l-l guess if I
really have, uh, proso...

353
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:05,601
Prosopagnosia.

354
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,935
Yes.

355
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,604
Well, you tell me.

356
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:12,232
Can you or can you not
see people's faces?

357
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,653
Well, of course I can
see people's faces.

358
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:20,824
It's just that they keep
changing all the time.

359
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:24,036
So, you have the answer
to your question.

360
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,873
Cinnamon candy?

361
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:34,630
But there must be some sort
of treatment. Medication or...

362
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:41,470
Face blindness isn't something
you just catch, Miss Marchant.

363
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,722
It's something
you lose.

364
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,017
What are you
telling me?

365
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:51,063
That I'm gonna be
stuck like this forever?

366
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:58,487
You're gonna have to get used
to people's faces changing...

367
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,989
<i>as soon as you lose
sight of them.</i>

368
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,825
<i>Out of a thousand faces...</i>

369
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,996
one might
miraculously linger.

370
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,669
Thank you so much.

371
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,839
Doctor.

372
00:29:17,923 --> 00:29:20,968
Faces are the bar code
of the human race.

373
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:23,762
Ever since mankind
went tribal...

374
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:26,515
we're constantly looking
at each other's faces...

375
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:30,852
trying to decide whether
they're friends, foes or lovers.

376
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:35,148
Don't underestimate the seriousness
of your condition, Miss Marchant.

377
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,919
I don't wanna
be late for school.

378
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:15,897
<i>Okay, everybody. Urn, can
I-can I get some quiet, please?</i>

379
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,944
Great.

380
00:30:21,028 --> 00:30:23,363
Urn...

381
00:30:23,447 --> 00:30:27,784
so today, uh, we are going
to play a new type of game.

382
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:29,786
<i>Okay?</i>

383
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:32,748
<i>And we get
to wear stickers!</i>

384
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:36,084
<i>And it's gonna
be superfun.</i>

385
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:38,670
Fun, fun, fun.

386
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,174
So when
I call your name...

387
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,676
I want you to come up
to my desk one by one...

388
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:50,140
<i>starting with
Caroline Beasley.</i>

389
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,976
Now, for this
game to work...

390
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,771
I need you to wear
the sticker all day long...

391
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,939
and don't take it off.
Do you understand?

392
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,108
Yes, Miss Marchant.

393
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:03,653
Does everybody understand? Please,
keep your stickers on all day.

394
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,700
Charlotte Canton.

395
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:12,704
Stop. You guys,
settle down. Please.

396
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:13,914
Caroline.

397
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:16,041
I didn't do anything!

398
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:18,460
I need you to turn around I
need to see your stickers.

399
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,003
Hi. I'm here
for my daughter.

400
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,922
Your daughter. Uh...

401
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:23,256
Sandra.

402
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:26,468
Sandra. Sandra.
Uh, Sandra.

403
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,595
<i>Uh-</i>

404
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,515
<i>Miss, Miss. Miss,
I need to go pee.</i>

405
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,683
Okay, sweetie,
go pee.

406
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:40,774
I'm sorry, I'm in a bit of
a rush. Where's my daughter?

407
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,152
Sorry. Uh, Sandra.
Sandra?

408
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,738
<i>Miss, Sandra left
with her daddy.</i>

409
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,615
Left with her dad.

410
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,159
You let her go with my
ex-husband? Are you insane?

411
00:31:51,243 --> 00:31:54,162
I told you not to let her
go with my ex-husband!

412
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:57,666
I have full custody!
What time did they go?

413
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,710
Was he with somebody? I need
to know if he was with somebody.

414
00:32:00,794 --> 00:32:02,921
<i>That is really,
really important.</i>

415
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:14,266
Shut up!

416
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,649
I have trouble concentrating
on names, that's all.

417
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,777
But it will pass.
I mean, it will pass.

418
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:27,946
In the meantime...

419
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,574
how are you gonna watch
the children in the yard?

420
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,952
Or during swimming
classes? With your stickers?

421
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:38,123
Anna, you're
my best teacher.

422
00:32:44,254 --> 00:32:46,673
But I'm gonna have to
suspend you. I'm sorry.

423
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:50,802
<i>If you're better by
September, I'll see what I can do.</i>

424
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,132
<i>"Be wary
of appearances...</i>

425
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,510
<i>and an unexpected
invitation to dinner."</i>

426
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,137
Carotid artery and the larynx are
severed, just like the others.

427
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:17,681
<i>Looks like a match.</i>

428
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,933
Missed him by minutes.

429
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:25,063
Kerrest.

430
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,316
He's here. He's here
with me right now.

431
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,819
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. What's going on?</i>

432
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,196
<i>I'm on the subway.
And the bag I lost...</i>

433
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,323
he put it right on the
seat in front of me.

434
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,742
Hold on.
You saw him?

435
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:41,454
<i>No, but there-there was somebody
watching me outside the school.</i>

436
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:43,665
Maybe he followed me
into the train.

437
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,667
<i>The bag, you
sure it's yours?</i>

438
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,836
Of course I'm sure.

439
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,589
I might not know people's faces,
but I know my own damn handbag.

440
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:54,175
All right. So, the guy you
saw, what's he look like?

441
00:34:54,259 --> 00:34:56,678
How the hell
should I know?

442
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:59,055
It could be any
goddamn one of them.

443
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,974
<i>You gotta help me
out here, all right?</i>

444
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,518
I can't shut down a whole
subway just for a handbag.

445
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,770
Urn, okay.

446
00:35:05,854 --> 00:35:08,690
He was wearing an orange
shirt, a bright orange shirt.

447
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:12,110
Orange shirt. Thank you.
Where are you exactly?

448
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:15,864
Line four, going
to Harlin Street.

449
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:18,908
You need to listen to me. Whatever
you do, you stay on that train.

450
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,870
Make sure that people are
around you. I'm gonna...

451
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:23,371
Hello?

452
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,832
Hello?

453
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,919
Damn.

454
00:35:30,003 --> 00:35:33,256
<i>Those connecting
to fine two, this is your exit.</i>

455
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,688
Make sure
where you go.

456
00:36:59,801 --> 00:37:00,885
No!

457
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,439
You stay away
from me. Stay away!

458
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,023
<i>What's going on?</i>

459
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,025
Don't move, buddy.
Stay where you are.

460
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,819
What the hell
is going on here?

461
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,113
<i>Anna, you told me
to meet you after work.</i>

462
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,533
I see you running down into the
subway. What the hell is going on here?

463
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:25,785
<i>Just stand still, sir.</i>

464
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:30,331
For God's sake, Snowflake.
Why are you so scared of me?

465
00:37:30,415 --> 00:37:32,083
Daddy?

466
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,419
Let go.

467
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,671
Oh, Daddy.

468
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,090
I'm so sorry.

469
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:41,092
Oh, Daddy.

470
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:43,178
Sweetie, it's all right.

471
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,431
It's all right.
I'm okay.

472
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:54,105
<i>Hey, it's Anna and Bryce. We're
not home. Please leave a message. Bye.</i>

473
00:37:54,189 --> 00:37:56,608
<i>Hi, Snowflake. Look,
I'm back at the airport.</i>

474
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,526
<i>Listen to me.</i>

475
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,863
<i>You have to tell Bryce
about your condition.</i>

476
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:04,199
<i>You can't
just ignore it.</i>

477
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,887
Hi.

478
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,640
Miss Marchant! Hello!

479
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,018
I just wanted to
tell you. Oh, God.

480
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,813
Everything you said...

481
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:20,275
you were right.

482
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,611
When I was 16...

483
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:28,116
I had two
passions in life.

484
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,953
Horse-back riding
and opera.

485
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,500
I dreamt of being
the next Callas.

486
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,878
Until the horse threw me
head-first into a brick wall.

487
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:43,131
The accident
left me deaf...

488
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,050
and I had to rule out
an operatic career.

489
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:48,344
You're deaf?

490
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:52,223
Oh, yes, as a post. I have to read
your lips to know what you're saying.

491
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:57,645
But I can still
hear Wagner.

492
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:01,149
I just have to close
my eyes and listen.

493
00:40:02,984 --> 00:40:06,487
And you too are going
to have to learn...

494
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,073
to find your
inner music.

495
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:12,869
Everyone always goes on
about sight, hearing, smell.

496
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:15,038
But there's
another sense.

497
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,706
A hidden one.

498
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,917
The Japanese
call it "muga."

499
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:23,046
It's the sense that
allows you to walk...

500
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,674
without having to think about putting
one foot in front of the other.

501
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:29,385
You lose this sense...

502
00:40:29,469 --> 00:40:32,972
and you will become like
some of my other patients.

503
00:40:33,056 --> 00:40:35,016
Socially paralyzed...

504
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,771
withdrawing from the world
into the safety of isolation.

505
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,774
That's a tempting option.

506
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:46,694
<i>No, I don't
want that. I wanna live normally.</i>

507
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,030
<i>Every day people
are going to resent you...</i>

508
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,658
for not recognizing
who they are.

509
00:40:51,741 --> 00:40:56,537
They'll call you rude,
forgetful, stupid, liar.

510
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,456
<i>Now, are you willing
to fight back...</i>

511
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,124
with all your might?

512
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:03,044
Yeah.

513
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,798
To try and try again without losing
heart, without giving an inch?

514
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:08,675
Yes.

515
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,678
Good.

516
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:15,890
Then let's get to work.

517
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,976
Allow me
to introduce you...

518
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,148
to Mike...

519
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:27,068
and Maggie.

520
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,570
Hard to tell apart at
first sight, aren't they?

521
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,322
Take a closer look.

522
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:34,909
Maggie is a little
paler, don't you think?

523
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,538
Oh, and look.
She had this scar...

524
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,498
on her forehead.

525
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,500
<i>You see?</i>

526
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:51,676
It gets more complicated when you have
to pick Mike and Maggie out at a party...

527
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:54,429
<i>among all
the other guests.</i>

528
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,597
Yeah.

529
00:41:56,681 --> 00:42:00,184
You're going to learn to focus
on distinctive markers in people.

530
00:42:00,268 --> 00:42:04,647
A mole, a tattoo,
their gait.

531
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:08,025
Anything that stands out that makes
it easier to identify that person.

532
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:10,111
Right.

533
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:13,114
What's the first thing you look
at in a man, after his face?

534
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,576
My friends and I
look at his butt.

535
00:42:18,453 --> 00:42:20,705
Well, what else
is there to look at?

536
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,541
Right.

537
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,215
<i>Paler in complexion,
small scar on the forehead.</i>

538
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,774
That's Maggie.

539
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:58,326
<i>Congratulations.</i>

540
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,566
Hi!

541
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:33,528
Hi.

542
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,198
So, what's this earth-shattering
thing you have to tell us?

543
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:44,997
The reservation's for seven. Do
you want me to come pick you up?

544
00:43:45,081 --> 00:43:47,458
No, I think
I'll meet you there.

545
00:43:51,087 --> 00:43:52,630
Okay.

546
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,134
I'll see you
later then.

547
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:57,635
Bye.

548
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:53,858
Hey.

549
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,527
Hey.

550
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:01,073
Wait. You...

551
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:05,453
You recognized me! Holy crap, can
we call off the straightjacket now?

552
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,747
Oh, thank God.

553
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:11,667
I couldn't take another wacko freak-out
every time I tried to kiss you.

554
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:17,048
So, this... this doesn't
change anymore, right?

555
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,467
You can-you can
really recognize me?

556
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:23,804
Yes, I do.

557
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:27,016
What are you
talking about?

558
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,976
You don't
recognize me?

559
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,645
I'm your best friend.

560
00:45:32,188 --> 00:45:34,732
I do. With your
unique hair cut...

561
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:38,194
and the red skirt you always wear
when you're trying to get some.

562
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:42,365
It's fine. But,
oh, God, I just...

563
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,452
When-when-when people are wearing the
same clothes or uniforms, forget it.

564
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:49,538
They all have
the same face to me.

565
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:53,668
What about Bryce?
How is he taking this?

566
00:45:54,961 --> 00:45:56,337
Oh, God.

567
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,340
He thinks that
I'm adjusting.

568
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,842
I told him that
I recognized him.

569
00:46:01,926 --> 00:46:03,928
<i>Please, promise me
you won't tell him.</i>

570
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,889
You're lying to him?

571
00:46:06,973 --> 00:46:11,477
I cannot lose him.
Do you understand?

572
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,729
<i>He's the only thing I have left.</i>

573
00:46:33,249 --> 00:46:35,251
<i>Hold it right there.</i>

574
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:38,504
You mean you get to bang
a new guy every night...

575
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:41,340
without ever cheating
on your boyfriend?

576
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:43,509
That's like a
dream come true.

577
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,572
Another drink.

578
00:47:16,292 --> 00:47:19,628
<i>Take one step.
Immerse yourself...</i>

579
00:47:19,712 --> 00:47:22,923
in people's gestures,
their mannerisms.

580
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:37,021
<i>Watch them until their
bodies become a melody.</i>

581
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:42,026
<i>Hum it, hum it, until you can
sing it at the top of your voice.</i>

582
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:44,278
<i>Use all your
resilience, Anna...</i>

583
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:47,907
<i>but whatever happens,
don't let the music stop.</i>

584
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,190
<i>Hiya.</i>

585
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:24,360
Oh. Hey.
How's it going?

586
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:25,778
Good.

587
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,072
Didn't expect
to see you here.

588
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,826
Well...it's nice
to see you.

589
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,370
I'm sorry, I don't
remember your name.

590
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,330
Hm.

591
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:38,165
That's odd.

592
00:48:38,249 --> 00:48:40,417
I, uh...

593
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,922
usually leave a strong
impression on women.

594
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:49,635
Okay. Well, see you later.

595
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:51,178
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

596
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,222
What's the rush, huh?

597
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:56,058
Things are just
getting interesting.

598
00:48:56,142 --> 00:48:59,395
<i>Hello. Can I
help you with anything?</i>

599
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,105
Come on,
make an effort.

600
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,775
You know who I am.

601
00:49:09,822 --> 00:49:12,533
Officer. Officer,
that man over there.

602
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:15,161
He's standing right
next to the newsstand.

603
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,329
What are you saying?

604
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,498
That man over...

605
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:26,505
Never mind.

606
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,092
<i>I am not letting...</i>

607
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,636
Excuse me.
Detective Kerrest, please.

608
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,138
Hold on.

609
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:36,140
I'm gonna check
if he's here.

610
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,480
Hey.

611
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:49,945
Seen any more killers
on public transport?

612
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:51,071
Just don't move.

613
00:49:51,155 --> 00:49:53,032
What are you doing?

614
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,492
I need to check something.
Can you stay there? Please.

615
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,369
I won't move.

616
00:50:07,046 --> 00:50:09,215
Oh, my God!

617
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,801
I recognize your face. I recognize
your face. It's still your face.

618
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,845
Me? You recognize me?

619
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:19,099
Yes.

620
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:22,019
It's the first face I
recognize since the incident.

621
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,314
Do you think
that means something?

622
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:27,524
I don't know.

623
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:33,280
I don't know.

624
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:42,122
Hey. Any word
from the DA?

625
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,251
Oh. Am I interrupting
something?

626
00:50:45,334 --> 00:50:46,752
No.

627
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,004
Are you okay?

628
00:50:49,088 --> 00:50:53,008
Miss Marchant, allow me to introduce
Eric Lanyon, our star pitcher...

629
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:55,302
ace profiler and
all-round swell guy.

630
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:58,764
They say it takes a warped mind
to get into a psychopath's head...

631
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,100
but I'm okay.
Really.

632
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:03,477
Nicky had
another nosebleed.

633
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,104
It's nice
to meet you.

634
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,730
<i>You, too. What
brings you here?</i>

635
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,775
I saw the papers.

636
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,444
I wanna know everything there
is to know about this man.

637
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:15,364
You're talking to the right guy.
Lanyon knows everything...

638
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:18,742
about our friendly
neighborhood whackjob.

639
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,997
I betcha can't pinch
a pen from Lydia's desk.

640
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,923
I don't know if he
really tried to kill you.

641
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,801
He has an odd way for asking
about dinner and a movie.

642
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,263
What he's saying is that maybe
he reacted out of self-defense.

643
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,515
Forgive me,
Miss Marchant.

644
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,101
If he really wanted to kill
you once you left hospital...

645
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:46,562
we wouldn't be standing
here talking about it.

646
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,772
I wanna help
catch this guy.

647
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,737
No. I'm not gonna...

648
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:58,115
I'm not gonna recognize his face
like that. I need to see them.

649
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,075
In front of me.

650
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:03,037
I guess it's
worth a shot.

651
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,456
I'd have to run to catch
the D.A. right now.

652
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,417
Very nice
to meet you.

653
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,423
So, what's your
colleague's theory?

654
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:17,134
He thinks you made quite
an impression on the freak.

655
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:19,136
Watched him do his
thing and walked away.

656
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:24,141
What do you think?

657
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:30,230
About a year ago when Homicide
turned up the first victim...

658
00:52:30,314 --> 00:52:35,069
Lanyon insisted he had the
hallmark of a sociopath.

659
00:52:35,194 --> 00:52:39,573
We didn't agree. We thought it
was a one off, a crime of passion.

660
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,284
Six months later, another
dead woman showed up.

661
00:52:42,368 --> 00:52:45,329
She had an 8-year-old
son who...

662
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,665
found her on the bedroom
floor with her throat cut.

663
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:53,962
Now he sees the kid
every chance he gets.

664
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:04,181
I've learned to keep my mouth
shut and trust what Lanyon says.

665
00:53:10,687 --> 00:53:11,939
Sh.

666
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,986
<i>Come on, you can
drop the freaking Snow White act.</i>

667
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,655
You've all been
here before.

668
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,365
Got a light?

669
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,659
There's no smoking here.
Come on, get in.

670
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:28,330
<i>All right, stand in line
and look straight ahead.</i>

671
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:30,249
Step it up.

672
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,504
They're all known offenders
that match your statement.

673
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,048
We're waiting on papers
to run DNA checks on 'em.

674
00:53:38,132 --> 00:53:40,384
They're all yours.

675
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,471
<i>How are we
doing in here?</i>

676
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,348
Fine.

677
00:53:55,566 --> 00:54:00,821
Do you think they
could move around a little bit?

678
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:04,533
All right, we've seen enough of your
ugly mugs. I want you to walk around.

679
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:08,078
<i>Anybody who slacks up
gets a night in a cell.</i>

680
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:11,081
I just need to see their gestures,
their-their-their movements.

681
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,041
I know it sounds
crazy but...

682
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,127
If you want to host a dance
class, it's fine with me.

683
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,588
<i>I said move your asses. Now, get to it.</i>

684
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,393
It's not any of them.

685
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:34,771
Are you sure?

686
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,525
Yeah.

687
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,652
At least we tried.

688
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,699
I'm really sorry.

689
00:54:46,825 --> 00:54:49,328
I-I wanted to help.

690
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,751
Anna.

691
00:55:06,512 --> 00:55:09,306
Good luck with
the investigation.

692
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:18,398
<i>Sam! Bad news.</i>

693
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,902
Mulgrew won't go for the witness
protection you requested for Anna Marchant.

694
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,029
After the subway blowout
and the line-up on top...

695
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:26,448
they don't think
she's 100% compos mentis.

696
00:55:26,532 --> 00:55:29,827
It's absolute bullshit. She's the
only witness we've got, for God's sake.

697
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,995
We need to up
our game here.

698
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,914
Organize another
line-up, manana.

699
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,166
Come on. We can't bring in
every perp in the city...

700
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:39,253
hoping she'll recognize the
inside leg of his trousers!

701
00:55:39,336 --> 00:55:42,839
I guess that'll give you a
good excuse to see her again.

702
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,591
What did you say?

703
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:47,135
Come on, buddy.
You know what I mean.

704
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,141
One, she has a boyfriend. Two,
there's nothing between us.

705
00:55:53,267 --> 00:55:57,437
Three, even if there was, I swear, if you
mention this to anybody, I will kick your ass.

706
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,691
It's highly unethical and possibly
illegal for a police officer...

707
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,860
to fraternize
with a key witness.

708
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:06,530
Whoa. It's that bad?

709
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,950
Screw it.

710
00:56:16,415 --> 00:56:19,293
I mean, seriously, can you
picture the two of us together...

711
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,878
arm in arm
at the police ball?

712
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,880
Why not?

713
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:26,091
I always thought you looked
rather fetching in uniform.

714
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:32,222
<i>Happy birthday, chica.</i>

715
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:34,433
Thank you.

716
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,979
Quick, quick.
Look, look.

717
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,064
A twelve out of ten.
Twelve out of ten.

718
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:43,567
He"s totally checking me out!

719
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:46,069
So that's what you do
on your girls' nights out?

720
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:49,573
<i>Well, no, not me.
No, just... just, um...</i>

721
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,242
<i>Everybody's
dancing tonight.</i>

722
00:56:53,911 --> 00:56:56,163
Even you, Bryce.

723
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:06,924
I'm gonna go
get us a drink.

724
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,425
Okay.

725
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,510
Did you see that?
Totally on me.

726
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,596
Where is he?

727
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,598
Okay, okay, back up.

728
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,434
Give her a chance.

729
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:19,019
Okay, what do I do?

730
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,354
Just act natural, okay?

731
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:21,855
Natural?

732
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,899
Okay?
Go, go, go.

733
00:57:23,982 --> 00:57:25,192
Okay.

734
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,519
Okay, okay.

735
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:08,276
<i>Hey, there you are.</i>

736
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,362
What took you so long?

737
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,738
Which one is mine?

738
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:18,495
Oh, God. You know I
don't like champagne.

739
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,163
Oh, yeah.

740
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:26,670
What did they put
in your drink?

741
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:36,638
Bryce!

742
00:58:36,722 --> 00:58:38,724
No, no, no, no.
Please, please.

743
00:58:38,807 --> 00:58:41,727
Let me see your
notebook. Let me see it.

744
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:50,318
God, Bryce,
it's just so...

745
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:53,029
<i>I'm-I'm so sorry.</i>

746
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,906
You lied to me.

747
00:58:54,990 --> 00:58:58,118
I'm just as much a
stranger as everyone else.

748
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,954
Was it me you were
seeing when we had sex?

749
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,666
Answer me. Was it
me you were seeing?

750
00:59:08,879 --> 00:59:10,422
I'm so, so sorry.

751
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,133
Look, this
face blind shit.

752
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,594
I can't deal
with it anymore.

753
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,597
Find yourself another
jerk to wear a tie.

754
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,932
Bryce.

755
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,815
Hello.

756
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30,192
<i>Happy birthday, Anna.</i>

757
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,651
Who is this?

758
00:59:31,735 --> 00:59:33,987
<i>Didn't my
number show up?</i>

759
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:41,244
<i>You really look drop
dread gorgeous tonight, Anna.</i>

760
00:59:42,829 --> 00:59:44,998
I know your face.
I've seen you before.

761
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,835
<i>You don't know my face.
You don't know anyone's face.</i>

762
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:52,214
<i>If I changed my shirt, you couldn't
tell me from your own father.</i>

763
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:55,509
<i>You're the only one
I don't need to hide from, Anna.</i>

764
00:59:55,634 --> 01:00:00,222
<i>No, no, that wasn't me. But maybe I'm
that guy there, to your right. To your right.</i>

765
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:03,350
<i>No, to your right, Anna!
Listen to what I'm saying!</i>

766
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,185
Please don't do this.

767
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:08,105
<i>You saw me
doing those things.</i>

768
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:10,482
<i>No one has ever
seen me before.</i>

769
01:00:10,565 --> 01:00:14,486
<i>You're the only one that can
stop me, Anna, so make it happen!</i>

770
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,822
<i>Or I'll have
to make you smile.</i>

771
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,448
<i>Smile from ear to ear.</i>

772
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:20,283
Please, don't do this!

773
01:00:20,367 --> 01:00:22,828
<i>Such a pretty smile...</i>

774
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,204
<i>it will make me cry.</i>

775
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:26,623
I'm calling the police.

776
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,835
<i>Go ahead. I have to go anyway.
Your friend's growing impatient.</i>

777
01:00:29,918 --> 01:00:31,586
Francine?

778
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,255
<i>Nina?</i>

779
01:00:33,338 --> 01:00:34,798
<i>Francine?</i>

780
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:36,633
<i>Nina?</i>

781
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,718
Francine!

782
01:00:40,887 --> 01:00:42,139
<i>Francine. Francine!</i>

783
01:00:42,222 --> 01:00:43,431
What the hell?

784
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,853
<i>Nina. Nina!</i>

785
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:51,565
Anna? What's happening?

786
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,650
Anna, Anna,
what's happening?

787
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,528
He's here. He just called me
from my phone. Where's Francine?

788
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,906
She was dancing with Mr.
"12-Out-of-10" just a moment ago.

789
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,075
We have to find her.
We have to find her. He's here.

790
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,827
All right, I'll call the police.

791
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:07,706
Francine!

792
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:10,500
Oh, my God. Nina.

793
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:28,685
<i>Anna.</i>

794
01:01:30,312 --> 01:01:32,355
<i>Anna!</i>

795
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:49,164
Set up a perimeter
and comb the area.

796
01:01:49,247 --> 01:01:51,666
I'll deal with
the paperwork.

797
01:02:02,344 --> 01:02:06,097
Okay. You got me.
I confess.

798
01:02:06,181 --> 01:02:09,100
<i>Come on, you're one scratch
away from a perfect DNA match.</i>

799
01:02:10,018 --> 01:02:12,020
<i>Sam.</i>

800
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:16,399
What is violet, striped, bloody
and floating in the crapper?

801
01:02:23,156 --> 01:02:26,701
She wanted to get
married to anyone.

802
01:02:26,785 --> 01:02:30,080
Why didn't
he pick me?

803
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:33,500
The man she was dancing
with, did you...

804
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,793
see his face?

805
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,629
No. Only from behind.

806
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:40,548
Can you
describe him to me?

807
01:02:40,632 --> 01:02:42,384
No.

808
01:02:42,467 --> 01:02:45,011
I'll get somebody
to take you home.

809
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:50,433
Oh, Nina.
We'll meet tomorrow.

810
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,108
<i>Here. You take care
of yourself, chica.</i>

811
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,582
<i>Your boyfriend is
not answering his phone.</i>

812
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:17,002
We're still trying
to get a hold of him.

813
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,135
You said you argued.
What was that about?

814
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,726
He found out
that, uh...

815
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:37,939
I was faking him.

816
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:53,413
<i>Bryce?</i>

817
01:04:10,055 --> 01:04:13,183
You're standing
on Bryce's jacket.

818
01:04:14,351 --> 01:04:15,935
Sorry.

819
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,326
It's my phone.

820
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,162
He called me on that
phone before Francine...

821
01:04:40,377 --> 01:04:42,962
Is that the jacket Bryce
was wearing this evening?

822
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:48,176
Yes, but...

823
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:50,095
No, it's not Bryce.

824
01:04:50,178 --> 01:04:52,806
I know him.

825
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:55,600
Besides, he called me that
night I was on the bridge.

826
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:00,480
That's a little trick we're
gonna have to ask him about.

827
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,901
Lanyon. Kerrest.

828
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:08,488
No. He's gone, but guess
what we just looked in.

829
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,827
So, let me get
this straight.

830
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:16,246
He strings us for a
year, and bingo...

831
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:18,498
we get all this juicy
evidence in one night?

832
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,835
I'll chew on that once we get
a DNA sample on this Bryce guy.

833
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,920
I just put out a
warrant for his arrest.

834
01:05:24,003 --> 01:05:25,672
Until then...

835
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,551
I'm not letting her
out of my sight, okay?

836
01:05:29,634 --> 01:05:31,136
I want her
totally insulated.

837
01:05:31,219 --> 01:05:33,096
I'll talk to the
D.A. about the tie.

838
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:35,598
I won't get anything before
Monday. You know the drill.

839
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,982
I'll have her back
Monday morning.

840
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:50,572
Do you trust me?

841
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:56,703
<i>Let's pack your things.
We're heading out of town.</i>

842
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,995
Rosemary. How are you?

843
01:06:43,291 --> 01:06:44,918
Everyone knows you?

844
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,212
Everyone knows everyone
on Koel Island. Hey.

845
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:49,464
Good morning.

846
01:06:49,547 --> 01:06:53,551
Just one doctor, one ATM, one mail
box. It really is another world.

847
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:57,055
Where are the
other children?

848
01:06:57,138 --> 01:07:00,225
That's the whole school.

849
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:03,353
<i>Mrs. Hayworth. She teaches
all the grades together.</i>

850
01:07:04,938 --> 01:07:06,731
She must be
103 by now.

851
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,693
You went there?

852
01:07:10,777 --> 01:07:12,820
Mm-hm.

853
01:07:12,904 --> 01:07:16,449
Didn't turn out
too bad...

854
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,451
till you had
to play football.

855
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:36,094
They've arrested Bryce.
He denies everything.

856
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:40,515
He says someone must have slipped
the phone into his pocket.

857
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:44,477
We'll know soon enough. They're testing
his DNA against the tear sample.

858
01:07:47,105 --> 01:07:48,731
Here.

859
01:07:55,947 --> 01:07:57,699
Thank you.

860
01:07:57,782 --> 01:07:59,576
How are you
holding up?

861
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:02,578
I don't know.

862
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,960
It's not just that
people's faces have changed.

863
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,130
It's like...

864
01:08:13,339 --> 01:08:16,175
I had to wait...

865
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:20,596
until I didn't recognize
myself to know who I really am.

866
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,017
Close your eyes.

867
01:08:38,281 --> 01:08:41,159
That's how you looked when I
first saw you at the hospital.

868
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:44,203
Please, don't
open them just yet.

869
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:55,214
I got a call when
they brought you in.

870
01:08:57,717 --> 01:09:01,512
You were out cold. I looked down at you
like I look down at Jane Does every day.

871
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,934
I don't know.

872
01:09:15,443 --> 01:09:17,862
It's like
I knew you.

873
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:21,240
Even though I'd
never seen your face.

874
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:28,748
I know it sounds
kinda wacko.

875
01:09:31,417 --> 01:09:34,754
As wacko as not recognizing
your own father.

876
01:09:41,677 --> 01:09:43,471
I can do wacko.

877
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,117
Anna.

878
01:12:11,869 --> 01:12:13,704
Anna.

879
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,999
Calm down, Anna,
it's okay. It's me.

880
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:22,338
<i>Anna, it's me, Kerrest.</i>

881
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,175
Don't you
recognize me anymore?

882
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,428
You've shaved?

883
01:12:32,557 --> 01:12:35,726
<i>Yes.</i>

884
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:41,065
Anything that makes the face stand
out, makes it easier to identify.

885
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:43,442
Oh, God, I was
such a fool.

886
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,861
Don't.

887
01:12:48,364 --> 01:12:50,658
Don't you get it?

888
01:12:50,741 --> 01:12:52,618
It's not you.

889
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,872
It's just a trick of
my screwed up brain!

890
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:00,251
You're nothing special.

891
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:04,213
You're just
another face.

892
01:13:12,847 --> 01:13:14,974
No.

893
01:13:26,193 --> 01:13:28,904
It's you.

894
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,371
It's still you.

895
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:41,792
It's still you.

896
01:13:46,797 --> 01:13:48,841
Hey, Lanyon.

897
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,305
<i>And they're
absolutely sure?</i>

898
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,474
I'll talk
to you later.

899
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:01,437
<i>The DNA is negative.</i>

900
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:03,981
Bryce is not
the killer.

901
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,821
Next time you have
a bad dream, I'll...

902
01:14:10,905 --> 01:14:13,658
<i>I'll just
leave you to it.</i>

903
01:14:13,741 --> 01:14:16,243
My dreams.

904
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:22,583
I can recognize
faces in my dreams.

905
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:27,254
<i>Hypnotism
is like a carnival mirror.</i>

906
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:31,592
It distorts the truth
as much as reveals it.

907
01:14:31,717 --> 01:14:37,014
<i>Or it could have devastating
consequences on your psyche.</i>

908
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,517
That's a risk
I'm willing to take.

909
01:14:44,271 --> 01:14:46,023
On the count
of three...

910
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:49,568
I want you
to close your eyes...

911
01:14:49,652 --> 01:14:52,113
and travel back
in your memories.

912
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,907
You can rewind...

913
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:59,870
pause, fast forward
as you wish.

914
01:14:59,954 --> 01:15:03,207
I'm counting
to three now.

915
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,667
One

916
01:15:06,001 --> 01:15:07,837
two

917
01:15:10,297 --> 01:15:11,799
three.

918
01:15:13,676 --> 01:15:16,429
Anna, I want
you to go back...

919
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,557
to the moment
before your fall.

920
01:15:29,692 --> 01:15:32,695
<i>Is there anybody
there with you?</i>

921
01:15:32,778 --> 01:15:34,655
<i>His face is...</i>

922
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,325
<i>It's hazy.</i>

923
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:44,540
I can't make out
his features.

924
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:47,084
<i>Her impairment
is causing a block.</i>

925
01:15:47,168 --> 01:15:49,045
I can't get
through it.

926
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:50,838
Not even
with hypnosis.

927
01:15:50,921 --> 01:15:52,882
She knows.

928
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:56,552
She knows
who he is.

929
01:15:56,635 --> 01:16:00,514
<i>Anna? I want you to
fuse the hazy impression...</i>

930
01:16:00,598 --> 01:16:04,060
<i>with your attacker's face.</i>

931
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:07,646
<i>Can you tell me if
you've seen him before?</i>

932
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,315
<i>On the street.</i>

933
01:16:09,398 --> 01:16:10,608
<i>Near your home.</i>

934
01:16:16,614 --> 01:16:18,324
<i>Yes.</i>

935
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,413
Hiya.

936
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,212
<i>Ask her if she saw him
the night he killed Francine.</i>

937
01:16:31,295 --> 01:16:33,964
Slow the hell down.
I can't read your lips.

938
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:36,008
The evening
of her birthday.

939
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:41,138
<i>Anna, was he there
at your birthday?</i>

940
01:16:42,932 --> 01:16:45,226
<i>Yes.</i>

941
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:48,771
<i>Anna, did you see him through
the two-way mirror in the line-up?</i>

942
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:51,607
<i>Yes. He's behind
the mirror.</i>

943
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,110
<i>Who? Who, Anna?
Who's behind the mirror?</i>

944
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:55,694
But...

945
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,196
<i>Anna, who is it?</i>

946
01:16:57,279 --> 01:16:58,614
I don't know.

947
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:02,076
<i>I don't know. I don't know.</i>

948
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,911
I don't know.

949
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:06,914
<i>Hey.</i>

950
01:17:15,089 --> 01:17:16,382
<i>Anna, what is it?</i>

951
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,175
He kissed me.

952
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:21,554
Oh, God.

953
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,639
Oh, God,
he kissed me.

954
01:17:23,722 --> 01:17:27,184
Anna, are you
all right?

955
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:29,562
It's okay.

956
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,898
<i>Lydia, I need warrants on all
six perps from the fast fine-up.</i>

957
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:34,441
<i>I want 'em now.</i>

958
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:41,198
Make yourself at home. No one knows
you're here. I'll call you when we get 'em.

959
01:17:41,282 --> 01:17:43,033
Be careful.

960
01:17:44,577 --> 01:17:46,704
Once all this is over...

961
01:17:46,787 --> 01:17:48,747
I'm gonna take you
back to Koel Island.

962
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:55,588
You promise?

963
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:58,340
I promise.

964
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,108
<i>What about the DNA?</i>

965
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:18,402
The tests came back negative.
Four out of six.

966
01:18:18,527 --> 01:18:22,197
None of them is our guy, Sam.
We're just jerking off here.

967
01:18:22,281 --> 01:18:25,409
Fine, go ahead. Flush
your career if you want.

968
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:30,080
You know what I think? I think you and
Tearjerk Jack have something in common.

969
01:18:30,164 --> 01:18:34,543
You're both in love with her, and
that's the only reason she's still alive.

970
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:38,380
- You coming or not?
- I'm gonna check on something.

971
01:18:38,464 --> 01:18:41,675
<i>"The lovers.
It's too late to turn back.</i>

972
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,261
<i>It's time to make
the right choice."</i>

973
01:19:27,221 --> 01:19:29,014
Hey, it's Anna.
Bryce called

974
01:19:29,098 --> 01:19:30,975
and he wants
to meet up and...

975
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:35,062
and I guess I just owe
him that. So, anyway.

976
01:19:35,145 --> 01:19:37,273
The address of where I'll be...

977
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,010
Hello, Anna.

978
01:20:06,093 --> 01:20:07,469
It's me.

979
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:12,599
I know.

980
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:16,103
Only a one-armed man could
tie a knot worse than you.

981
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:24,153
I caught a cold when I was in the
detention cell, believe it or not.

982
01:20:32,369 --> 01:20:35,080
Hey, I'm taking
this scumbag with me.

983
01:20:35,164 --> 01:20:36,582
Come on.

984
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39,668
Watch your head.

985
01:20:41,337 --> 01:20:44,131
Look, I...

986
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:47,301
I've acted like
a total asshole.

987
01:20:47,384 --> 01:20:50,012
And-and not just
the other evening.

988
01:20:51,430 --> 01:20:53,057
For a long
time now.

989
01:20:55,476 --> 01:20:57,519
And I'm sorry.

990
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,401
Excuse me.

991
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:06,278
<i>Here's your drinks.</i>

992
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,206
Bryce, you know
I don't like champagne.

993
01:21:40,562 --> 01:21:42,731
I thought
it felt right.

994
01:21:51,031 --> 01:21:53,158
Tickets to Vegas.

995
01:22:15,722 --> 01:22:17,975
And after I squeeze out
a couple rug-rats...

996
01:22:18,058 --> 01:22:20,936
we'll buy some
old money pit and...

997
01:22:21,019 --> 01:22:24,606
slide contentedly
off into senility.

998
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,862
Oh, God. Bryce,
l-l tried.

999
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:32,448
I really did.

1000
01:22:35,117 --> 01:22:38,412
Every time your face kept
changing, I tried so hard.

1001
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:43,500
And you know
what I found out?

1002
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:48,130
That the way you look or don't look each
morning, it really wouldn't matter...

1003
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,968
if I truly loved you.

1004
01:22:58,974 --> 01:23:00,309
Uh, I...

1005
01:23:02,144 --> 01:23:04,688
I really didn't
expect this...

1006
01:23:04,771 --> 01:23:06,982
after getting
your text message.

1007
01:23:10,903 --> 01:23:14,239
I'm sorry,
I'll be right back.

1008
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,032
Hey, has anybody
seen my cell phone?

1009
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:23,475
Bryce!

1010
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:26,478
We have to get out of here.
We've been set up.

1011
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,855
I think he's here.

1012
01:24:33,235 --> 01:24:35,654
Yo, Columbo.
You got a light?

1013
01:24:44,913 --> 01:24:47,040
<i>Five new messages.</i>

1014
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:49,584
<i>Hey, it's Anna. Bryce
called and he wants to meet up.</i>

1015
01:24:49,668 --> 01:24:54,339
<i>And I guess I just owe him that.
Anyway, the address where I'll be...</i>

1016
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,174
Shit, shit,
shit, shit!

1017
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:03,265
<i>It's Kerrest.
Leave a message.</i>

1018
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:06,351
<i>Hi, it's Anna.
I can't get...</i>

1019
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:08,520
Thanks for letting
me smoke, man.

1020
01:25:08,603 --> 01:25:14,276
Relaxed. Not like that pig who
took my smoke at the line-up.

1021
01:25:14,359 --> 01:25:16,945
<i>You should've
smacked that prick.</i>

1022
01:25:17,029 --> 01:25:18,655
No smoking.

1023
01:25:18,739 --> 01:25:21,283
<i>He's behind the mirror.</i>

1024
01:25:21,366 --> 01:25:24,578
<i>Come on, you're one scratch
away from a perfect DNA match.</i>

1025
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,831
<i>I learned to keep my mouth
shut and trust what Lanyon says.</i>

1026
01:25:45,474 --> 01:25:47,601
<i>Whatever happens, Anna...</i>

1027
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,646
<i>don't let
the music stop.</i>

1028
01:26:05,202 --> 01:26:06,995
Bryce.

1029
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,712
Kiss me.

1030
01:26:33,063 --> 01:26:36,441
Think, Lydia. Lanyon was at the line-up.
He had access to all the evidence.

1031
01:26:36,525 --> 01:26:39,236
The kid was the perfect
smokescreen. It all fits.

1032
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,238
No, screw the backup.
We don't have...

1033
01:26:41,321 --> 01:26:44,282
Anna! Anna, wait!

1034
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:45,742
Dammit.

1035
01:26:45,826 --> 01:26:47,536
Hey, man, where
are you going?

1036
01:26:48,829 --> 01:26:50,872
Grey shirt.
Black jacket.

1037
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,422
Look out!

1038
01:26:58,505 --> 01:27:02,217
<i>Anna! Anna!</i>

1039
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,552
<i>Anna!</i>

1040
01:27:03,635 --> 01:27:06,138
Lanyon, drop it.

1041
01:27:06,221 --> 01:27:09,015
<i>Drop the gun, shithead. It's me.
Don't listen to him. He's Lanyon.</i>

1042
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,350
<i>I'm Kerrest.</i>

1043
01:27:10,434 --> 01:27:11,935
Anna, run!

1044
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:14,479
<i>Stay right there.
Drop the gun.</i>

1045
01:27:14,563 --> 01:27:16,231
<i>You drop it.</i>

1046
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:32,164
Lanyon.

1047
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:06,239
Anna.

1048
01:28:06,323 --> 01:28:08,867
Where are you?

1049
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,452
Anna, it's me.

1050
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:19,062
Anna! Make sure
you stay hidden.

1051
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,692
Backup's gonna be here.

1052
01:29:32,242 --> 01:29:35,245
First, there's
a bloody kid...

1053
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:38,331
<i>who sees me off his mother.
You think he'll tell someone?</i>

1054
01:29:38,415 --> 01:29:42,752
<i>No. Not a single
peep in a year.</i>

1055
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,548
<i>The traumatized
little fucker.</i>

1056
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:53,430
<i>And then there's
you, Anna.</i>

1057
01:29:55,765 --> 01:29:59,352
You saw me crying
when that's...

1058
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:05,150
<i>That's not a Howe d.</i>

1059
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:07,319
<i>It wa-it was
a miracle.</i>

1060
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:10,155
<i>You lost all the other
faces because of it.</i>

1061
01:30:15,702 --> 01:30:19,331
<i>Oh, no, no, no, you're not
doing your little diving act again.</i>

1062
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:23,793
<i>Goddammit, Anna.</i>

1063
01:30:23,877 --> 01:30:25,670
The safety catch.

1064
01:30:25,754 --> 01:30:29,341
This, Anna, is why
I like blades so much.

1065
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:30,467
<i>Anna!</i>

1066
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:48,652
Anna.

1067
01:30:49,903 --> 01:30:51,988
Don't move!
I mean it.

1068
01:30:52,072 --> 01:30:53,990
It's me, Anna.

1069
01:30:54,074 --> 01:30:56,701
If we stay here, we'll
make one hell of a target.

1070
01:30:56,785 --> 01:30:59,829
Now, give me
back my gun.

1071
01:30:59,913 --> 01:31:02,499
Stay where you are.
I mean it.

1072
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:06,544
Anna, on-on
Koel Island...

1073
01:31:06,628 --> 01:31:08,713
there's a school with
half a dozen pupils.

1074
01:31:11,466 --> 01:31:13,677
<i>You recognize me now?</i>

1075
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:33,154
What did you promise me before
you left? What did you say?

1076
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:35,949
Very good. I could have told
Lanyon about the weekend...

1077
01:31:36,032 --> 01:31:39,202
but that's something
only I can know, right?

1078
01:31:39,285 --> 01:31:40,495
Anna.

1079
01:31:49,254 --> 01:31:50,714
<i>Look out!</i>

1080
01:32:05,687 --> 01:32:07,522
I knew...

1081
01:32:08,690 --> 01:32:11,109
you were the one...

1082
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,528
<i>who'd end
this shit.</i>

1083
01:32:19,117 --> 01:32:21,119
Give me the gun.

1084
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:27,375
Here.

1085
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,075
<i>I guess...</i>

1086
01:33:01,159 --> 01:33:03,286
you will
never take her...

1087
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,790
to the police ball.

1088
01:33:12,045 --> 01:33:13,588
Oh, no.

1089
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:26,684
Oh, God.

1090
01:33:27,811 --> 01:33:30,021
Oh, God,
no, no.

1091
01:33:30,105 --> 01:33:32,524
No, no.

1092
01:33:32,607 --> 01:33:35,276
Please, don't-don't move.

1093
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:38,238
Don't move, please.

1094
01:33:38,321 --> 01:33:41,449
I'm fine.
Seriously, I'm fine.

1095
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:45,203
Don't leave me.
Please, don't leave me.

1096
01:33:45,286 --> 01:33:47,080
You can't leave me.

1097
01:33:47,163 --> 01:33:49,582
Oh, God.

1098
01:33:54,128 --> 01:33:55,880
Sh, don't move.

1099
01:33:55,964 --> 01:33:57,882
You'll find
someone else.

1100
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:00,218
You'll see.

1101
01:34:00,301 --> 01:34:02,512
You'll find
someone else.

1102
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,597
You don't have
the right to leave me.

1103
01:34:06,432 --> 01:34:08,351
I love you.

1104
01:34:09,769 --> 01:34:12,021
I know you don't.

1105
01:34:14,107 --> 01:34:16,776
I'm just another
face in the crowd.

1106
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:23,700
Don't leave.

1107
01:34:23,783 --> 01:34:26,411
Stay with me.

1108
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:34,544
No.

1109
01:34:36,588 --> 01:34:39,173
Don't leave me!

1110
01:34:39,257 --> 01:34:41,593
Don't go!

1111
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:46,139
Oh, no, no, no.
Please, don't go.

1112
01:35:47,116 --> 01:35:49,410
<i>I live here now.</i>

1113
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:53,206
<i>The school board accepted
my transfer request.</i>

1114
01:35:56,167 --> 01:36:00,880
<i>I can identify each
of my pupils perfectly.</i>

1115
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:06,886
<i>As well as the handful of people
who live here in the off season.</i>

1116
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,683
<i>Nina comes to see me
from time to time.</i>

1117
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:14,185
<i>She's still single.</i>

1118
01:36:17,981 --> 01:36:20,608
<i>I'm just taking it
one step at a time.</i>

1119
01:36:23,277 --> 01:36:26,322
<i>Sometimes I see a face...</i>

1120
01:36:26,406 --> 01:36:31,744
<i>and for a second it's
like I see him again.</i>

1121
01:36:31,828 --> 01:36:36,040
<i>It's the only way I can
keep his face in my memory.</i>

1122
01:36:36,124 --> 01:36:39,168
<i>Mommy!</i>

1123
01:36:39,252 --> 01:36:43,548
<i>But when I look
into her face...</i>

1124
01:36:43,631 --> 01:36:47,135
<i>whatever it was that let
him get through to me...</i>

1125
01:36:47,218 --> 01:36:49,804
<i>he passed it
on to her.</i>

1126
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,684
<i>And just when I thought
I'd lost everything...</i>

1127
01:36:54,767 --> 01:36:57,186
<i>I found a face.</i>

1128
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:00,690
<i>One face...</i>

1129
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:02,859
<i>in which I can
always read...</i>

1130
01:37:04,861 --> 01:37:06,654
<i>love.</i>
