1
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:18,988
(upbeat mysterious music)

2
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,760
- [Narrator] There is a light that shines

3
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,483
in the distant cosmos.

4
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:36,890
Many points of energy sharing
a common mind and purpose,

5
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,640
but each possessing our own free will.

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,683
We are the Alterian Collective,

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,090
ascended beyond physical limitations.

8
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:49,320
We know not hunger, nor strife.

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,623
We are harvesters of data,
shepherds of knowledge.

10
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,403
We want your lives and hear your stories.

11
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,006
Our favorites are the sexy ones.

12
00:01:02,006 --> 00:01:04,589
(upbeat music)

13
00:02:08,993 --> 00:02:11,293
- [Dara'Tel] Expedition log 2120.

14
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,780
My research team has
followed me to the ends

15
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,663
of the charted galaxy on
a quest to kill a god.

16
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,700
Today, our vessel, The
DeJorge, touches down

17
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,613
on the fourth moon of Thanagar.

18
00:02:27,806 --> 00:02:28,803
- Just easing her in now.

19
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,683
Maybe wanna grab onto something.

20
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,100
- [Dara'Tel] We've arrived at
the Temple of the All Mother,

21
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,950
where this whole cosmic course began.

22
00:02:39,103 --> 00:02:41,560
(upbeat music)

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,773
And here it will end.

24
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,889
(moaning)

25
00:02:50,889 --> 00:02:51,722
- Oh, ooh.

26
00:02:54,531 --> 00:02:56,781
(laughing)

27
00:03:00,273 --> 00:03:04,523
- [Dara'Tel] Professor
Dara'Tel Quenthosz, end log.

28
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:08,462
(upbeat music)

29
00:03:14,535 --> 00:03:16,975
(sighing)

30
00:03:16,975 --> 00:03:19,892
(computer beeping)

31
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:27,040
- Air is breathable,
with gravity at .9951.

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,550
No reading on noxious gases or bacteria.

33
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,070
- Excellent, Pim.

34
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,420
We'll touch ground in five.

35
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,670
Give the receiver a chance to
pick up any stray particles

36
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:38,420
that might be floating around here.

37
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,577
- Looks like the high country back home.

38
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:45,610
- Looks can be deceiving, Pim.

39
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,540
This is the boondocks of the galaxy,

40
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,590
and no one's been out here for millennia.

41
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,013
Keep an eye on those readouts.

42
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:59,379
(computer beeping)

43
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:06,901
(upbeat music)

44
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,123
- I'm not interrupting anything, am I?

45
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,050
- Ready for class, Professor.

46
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,863
- It's more of a field trip, Marion.

47
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,630
I was not aware that there
was a weapon aboard this ship.

48
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,393
- Well, Daddy told me to come prepared.

49
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,363
You know Daddy.

50
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,003
- I see.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,900
Pack a full medi kit.

52
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,763
We'll be tackling a thick bush.

53
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,150
- Yeah, sure thing.

54
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,903
- We touch ground in five, you two.

55
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,033
- I think it's nice.

56
00:04:51,549 --> 00:04:54,466
(mysterious music)

57
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:13,780
- Perimeter is secure, with
a beacon at every click.

58
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,460
- Yeah, and we're
working the lower levels,

59
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,133
but they appear to open
to a crude tunnel system.

60
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,710
Goddess knows how far those run.

61
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,160
- Professor?

62
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,023
- Yes. Only the Goddess knows for now.

63
00:05:30,269 --> 00:05:33,602
(soft mysterious music)

64
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:44,420
Secure them as best as you can for now.

65
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:47,923
We'll explore them later.

66
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,773
Now leave me.

67
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,970
Leave me!

68
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:56,914
- Sure thing, Professor.

69
00:05:56,914 --> 00:06:00,247
(soft mysterious music)

70
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:10,113
- I have traveled to the far
reaches of the charted galaxy,

71
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,113
and drained all of my project's
funding chasing a legend.

72
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,843
What do I find?

73
00:06:25,271 --> 00:06:29,521
Could there be just a bit
of magic in the universe?

74
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,563
Hello there.

75
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,880
What are you, little one?

76
00:06:47,804 --> 00:06:49,504
Are you a semi-intelligent fungus?

77
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,913
Are you a little highly evolved bacteria?

78
00:06:56,456 --> 00:06:57,789
I think you are.

79
00:07:00,616 --> 00:07:03,179
(soft moaning)

80
00:07:03,179 --> 00:07:05,596
(soft music)

81
00:07:25,092 --> 00:07:26,842
That was interesting.

82
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,087
Should we try that again?

83
00:07:33,689 --> 00:07:34,545
Oh.

84
00:07:34,545 --> 00:07:36,962
(soft music)

85
00:07:44,928 --> 00:07:46,845
- Yes, I would want it.

86
00:07:51,518 --> 00:07:52,632
- Oh.

87
00:07:52,632 --> 00:07:55,049
(soft music)

88
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:00,801
- [All Mother] Come to me, Professor.

89
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:03,718
Yes, yes (laughs).

90
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:12,684
(computer beeping)

91
00:08:19,595 --> 00:08:22,595
(soft upbeat music)

92
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:27,333
- [Gab-E] You're really
working that human form, Maxy.

93
00:08:28,599 --> 00:08:30,650
- I don't know.

94
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,640
I'm honored that they
chose me for the squadron,

95
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,240
but humans are so much maintenance.

96
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,443
The teeth alone.

97
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,340
And don't get me started on the holes.

98
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,050
These humans have at
least a dozen of them,

99
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,080
each with a different function.

100
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,543
- [Gab-E] Yet, here you are.

101
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,690
- I don't know. I'm
still getting used to it.

102
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:50,003
It's a huge adjustment.

103
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,890
- [Computer] Did you hear
about the type five pulse event

104
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,703
that just happened in Gamma Sector?

105
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,740
- Gamma Sector? There's nobody out there.

106
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,610
A type five, for real?

107
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,923
- [Gab-E] That's what's
coming through the data feed.

108
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,253
- Yeah, I can feel it.

109
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:08,550
Oh well.

110
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,100
There's no way they would
give us type five anyway.

111
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,320
- [Gab-E] Not with that attitude.

112
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,720
- That assignment will
go to a senior collector.

113
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,020
We won't get so much as a type two

114
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,893
Jillaxian Diddler on our first run.

115
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,140
- [Gab-E] Cosmic perv alert.

116
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:26,440
This looks like a job for
Collector 4878 Maxy Prime

117
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,190
and her intrepid auxiliary

118
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:32,820
and the real brains of
the outfit, Gab-E Jinx.

119
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,730
- You're sticking with that form?

120
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,670
- I'm still working it out.

121
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:40,880
But, it is pleasing, utilitarian,

122
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,000
and it only has three holes, I think.

123
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,860
- Collector 4878, Auxiliary 8127,

124
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:52,210
report to council chambers
immediately for assignment.

125
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:56,275
(upbeat rock music)

126
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,023
Can you guess why we summoned you here?

127
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,150
- I heard about the type
five, but it can't be that.

128
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:32,670
- It is indeed.

129
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:35,400
- What? No, there must be some mistake.

130
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,530
- The Alterian High Council
is an ageless cosmic tribunal.

131
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,400
We have seen the birth and
death of entire star systems

132
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,160
while evolving into points of pure energy.

133
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,830
- [Hi-Co] We do not make mistakes.

134
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:51,000
- You would know that if
you weren't so newly formed.

135
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,430
- Right.

136
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:55,470
So why are you sending me to
investigate a godlike energy

137
00:10:55,470 --> 00:10:57,830
pulse in the far reaches of the galaxy?

138
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:00,983
- We have the utmost faith
in you, Collector 4878.

139
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,470
- I'm here too.

140
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,810
- And the orgy wars of
Crimulan Seven have depleted

141
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:08,440
our reserves of collectives
for the time being.

142
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,730
- Yeah, I've noticed it was
a little quiet around here.

143
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,740
- So we are relying on you to investigate

144
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,150
the situation and gather intelligence,

145
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:18,980
remembering always the Alterian credo.

146
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,940
- Touch not, lest ye be touched.

147
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,020
- Correct, Collector 4878.

148
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,430
- I see our faith in
you was not ill-founded.

149
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,320
- Three cheers then for the collector,

150
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,748
and this other one.

151
00:11:33,748 --> 00:11:36,165
(applauding)

152
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,833
- Were we just dismissed?

153
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,867
- I don't know. These
guys give me the creeps.

154
00:11:43,867 --> 00:11:45,034
Let's just go.

155
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:49,288
(whooshing)

156
00:11:52,987 --> 00:11:55,728
(moaning)

157
00:11:55,728 --> 00:11:56,848
- Ah.

158
00:11:56,848 --> 00:11:59,347
(upbeat music)

159
00:11:59,347 --> 00:12:02,180
(muffled moaning)

160
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,624
(mysterious music)

161
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:05,291
(alien crawling)

162
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,874
(upbeat music)

163
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,589
(soft moaning)

164
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,172
(upbeat music)

165
00:13:45,886 --> 00:13:48,469
(soft moaning)

166
00:13:56,062 --> 00:13:58,645
(upbeat music)

167
00:14:35,299 --> 00:14:38,072
(shivering)

168
00:14:38,072 --> 00:14:41,405
(soft mysterious music)

169
00:15:15,068 --> 00:15:17,717
(upbeat music)

170
00:15:17,717 --> 00:15:18,550
- Come on.

171
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,894
(giggling)

172
00:15:21,894 --> 00:15:24,894
(upbeat rock music)

173
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:46,449
(soft moaning)

174
00:15:53,062 --> 00:15:56,395
(soft mysterious music)

175
00:16:05,532 --> 00:16:08,690
- Hey, Maxy, have you
ever been out this far?

176
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:09,720
- No.

177
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,430
They say only outlaws
and long-haul freighters

178
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,020
ever pass through here.

179
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,210
- Do you think we'll find
something of interest?

180
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,860
- Nothing too sexy, or they
never would have sent us.

181
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,720
- Coming in range now.

182
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,500
- Boosting in two, one.

183
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,550
- Hey, Maxy, do you think
things'll get physical down here?

184
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:29,770
- I'd say that's a
distinct possibility, yes.

185
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,263
- I mean, that kinda physical.

186
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:36,090
- I'd say that's a
distinct possibility, yes.

187
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:36,943
- I thought so.

188
00:16:39,950 --> 00:16:43,100
- Is that okay? It's what we trained for.

189
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,700
- Yeah, I'm just excited is all.

190
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,640
- I know what you mean.

191
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,360
Boosting in two, one.

192
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,780
- And, a little nervous.

193
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,273
- Well, there's a first time
for everyone, even an Alterian.

194
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,800
Are you ready to boost now?

195
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,710
- Yes.

196
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:00,500
- In two, one.

197
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,800
- What if I don't like it?

198
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,733
Or, what if I like it too much?

199
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,170
- I think the important
thing is to remember

200
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,580
your training, Gab-E.

201
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,690
You were put on this mission for a reason.

202
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,324
The High Council has faith in you,

203
00:17:16,324 --> 00:17:18,674
but you need to have
faith in yourself as well.

204
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:23,670
- You're right, Maxy. I'm
gonna be the best at sex.

205
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,300
- That's the spirit, Gab-E.

206
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,132
Boosting in two, one.

207
00:17:27,132 --> 00:17:29,020
- I'm gonna have all the sex.

208
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,353
(whooshing)

209
00:17:39,637 --> 00:17:40,637
- Professor?

210
00:17:44,198 --> 00:17:45,031
Professor?

211
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:50,053
- Um.

212
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,736
- Professor, it's past 11.

213
00:17:57,736 --> 00:18:01,223
Don't you think we should
be starting our day?

214
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,383
Did you sleep here last night?

215
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:11,847
- Yes, Marion, thank you.

216
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,600
I was overtaken by the rich
Thanagarian culture of the place

217
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,350
and wanted to immerse myself in it.

218
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,960
An opportunity we should
all take while we're here.

219
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:29,971
- Of course, Professor.

220
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:35,363
But, don't you think you should um?

221
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,397
- Yes, Marion, thank you.

222
00:18:42,053 --> 00:18:44,233
Are Jeetz and Pim awake as well?

223
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,103
- No.

224
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,583
They slept in.

225
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,063
Together.

226
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:59,473
- Well, fetch them and
clear out the commissary.

227
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:04,660
We'll be here for breakfast
in no more than 15 paraclicks.

228
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,906
I'm famished.

229
00:19:05,906 --> 00:19:08,823
(soft piano music)

230
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,890
Marion, this is a new world.

231
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,963
And we are pioneers.

232
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:23,840
Pioneers don't stand
blubbering in the hall.

233
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,390
Pioneers clear out the
commissary and serve breakfast

234
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,900
for the new gods every damn day.

235
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,220
Now go, Marion.

236
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:32,763
Run!

237
00:19:33,865 --> 00:19:34,698
Run!

238
00:19:34,698 --> 00:19:37,448
(Marion sobbing)

239
00:19:41,821 --> 00:19:44,404
(upbeat music)

240
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,310
- What a glorious plurality.

241
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,023
Would you look at this relic?

242
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,640
- This is someone else's
property, and we're trespassing.

243
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,223
- No, it belongs in a museum.

244
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,480
Look, the controls are touch activated,

245
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,570
and it runs on ion hyper clusters.

246
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,580
- Primitive.

247
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,200
- Right? A classic.

248
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,890
Do you wanna activate the fusion chambers?

249
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,770
All you do is flip a couple
switches and pull this lever.

250
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,860
- No, stop. Don't touch that.

251
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,900
- Let's take it for a spin.

252
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,350
- No, stop stop stop. This
is not why we're here.

253
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:21,125
(light music)

254
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:26,107
(sniffling)

255
00:20:26,107 --> 00:20:28,607
(light music)

256
00:20:38,390 --> 00:20:40,723
(crunching)

257
00:20:43,169 --> 00:20:44,002
- Mm.

258
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:56,233
- You know, we're not really
doing the best on rations.

259
00:20:59,309 --> 00:21:02,130
(scoffing)

260
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,293
I wanted to install a
stasis garden this morning.

261
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:09,830
But, we didn't quite get to that.

262
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:14,180
- Well, we were all worn
out from the journey.

263
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,383
I think we really needed
the extra time in bed.

264
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,990
- We were in cryo sleep for two months.

265
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,640
- We had a busy night last night.

266
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,003
In fact, we got real busy.

267
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,703
I feel drained, and I know Jeetz is.

268
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,860
- How could you, Jeetz?

269
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,353
I thought we were life mates.

270
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:41,890
- We are. I don't even know what happened.

271
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,775
- I hate you, Jeetz Axelrod!

272
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,950
(laughing)

273
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:52,349
- That's a real pathetic
way of bonding, guys.

274
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:53,867
I don't think any of this is funny.

275
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:56,300
- Oh, get over it, Jeetz.

276
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:59,360
- Is she even qualified
to be on this expedition?

277
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,690
- Well, her parents are
significant contributors

278
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:04,070
to the sanctorum.

279
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:08,073
I'm sure you've visited the
Alvudo Deep Space Observatory.

280
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,520
- Ah, gotcha.

281
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,010
Still, though, doesn't
she seem a little unhinged

282
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:16,070
to be toting around a blaster?

283
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:18,313
- Well, seems like a big deal to her,

284
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,533
and I don't foresee any
negative consequence.

285
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,243
Now that we've all regained our strength,

286
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,343
we will begin moving our
things into the temple.

287
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:34,933
We will make this our home
for the duration of the

288
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,083
expedition.

289
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:41,858
(soft music)

290
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:44,025
(sobbing)

291
00:22:55,468 --> 00:22:58,470
- Jeetz?

292
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,303
Is that you?

293
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,310
If you think I'm packing up your shit

294
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:04,733
for the temple, you're clearly mistaken.

295
00:23:05,743 --> 00:23:07,910
(sobbing)

296
00:23:09,883 --> 00:23:13,001
That shuttle has left the dock!

297
00:23:13,001 --> 00:23:15,087
(sobbing)

298
00:23:15,087 --> 00:23:18,004
(soft piano music)

299
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:19,912
Jeetz?

300
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,099
(whirring)

301
00:23:24,099 --> 00:23:27,432
(soft mysterious music)

302
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,830
Who the hell are you?

303
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,783
- I'm Gab-E Jinx. Pleased to meet you.

304
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,710
Ooh, you're cute.

305
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,700
- I'll blast you.

306
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,370
- Please, we mean you no harm.

307
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:46,220
We're pilgrims to the temple,
and we've lost our clothes.

308
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,213
Can you help us?

309
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,889
(soft upbeat music)

310
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,150
- Have you fools installed
the comm systems yet?

311
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:18,053
- Yeah, Pim is on it now.

312
00:24:19,327 --> 00:24:21,110
And I have noticed your language become

313
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:23,640
gradually more abusive throughout the day.

314
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,473
- Have you?

315
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,660
That surprises me.

316
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,973
- And I don't think the
Scholastica Infinitum

317
00:24:28,973 --> 00:24:31,110
would like the idea of us using our comms

318
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,113
to barter for food.

319
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,543
- Priorities must shift
as necessity dictates.

320
00:24:36,566 --> 00:24:38,940
If our rate of consumption
continues in this manner,

321
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,673
the stasis gardens won't do.

322
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:44,420
- I just wish we were involved
in some of these decisions.

323
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,040
- Yeah, when are we gonna get a turn

324
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,440
with the pleasure beast?

325
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,540
You barely let us touch it all day.

326
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,823
- Is it my fault the beast favors me?

327
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,030
Perhaps it senses my superior intellect.

328
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,273
- Blow it out your ass.

329
00:25:00,941 --> 00:25:02,996
- [Blue] Breaker, breaker, you've got

330
00:25:02,996 --> 00:25:03,829
Blue Hugh Mongous on the side.

331
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,420
- Ooh, we got a live one.

332
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,220
What are you hauling, Blue?

333
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:12,270
- [Blue] On my way to Therax Beta,

334
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,933
with a full tanker of
soylent paste, come on.

335
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,953
- That'll work just fine, Bluey.

336
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,340
- [Blue] Sorry, what'll work? Come on.

337
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:25,690
- If that husky voice is any
indication of the caliber

338
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:28,700
of stud I'm dealing with,
you might just scratch me

339
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,310
right where I itch.

340
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,702
How's that grab you?

341
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:34,880
- [Blue] Dang, Miss, that's
a real tempting offer,

342
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,343
but I got a schedule to keep.

343
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,836
- Why do they call you Hugh Mongous?

344
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:46,280
- [Blue] Now that's a personal question.

345
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,663
Maybe someday, if I
get to know you better.

346
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:53,060
- You need to bring that sexy ass of yours

347
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:56,803
to the fourth moon of
Thanagar, for some downtime.

348
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,620
Some all the way downtime,

349
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,050
if you catch my meaning, big boy.

350
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,350
- [Blue] Oh, ho ho, I don't know.

351
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:06,260
You seen nice and all, but--

352
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,020
- You got optics on that thing?

353
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
- [Blue] Yeah, top of the line, come on.

354
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,973
All right.

355
00:26:12,973 --> 00:26:15,222
- [Pim] You like what you see, Blue?

356
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:18,653
- [Blue] Yeah, sure do.

357
00:26:18,653 --> 00:26:22,570
Ooh, baby, you got more twists
than a Cenerian cyclone.

358
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:25,622
- Well then, why don't
you park that big tanker

359
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:30,622
of protein slurry and come on over?

360
00:26:31,076 --> 00:26:33,262
- [Blue] Oh yeah.

361
00:26:33,262 --> 00:26:35,845
(upbeat music)

362
00:26:40,648 --> 00:26:41,481
- Yay!

363
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,910
What are we all celebrating?

364
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:48,700
- Your teammates were able
to active the comm system

365
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,053
and arrange for provisions
to be delivered.

366
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:55,580
- Well, that's good to hear,

367
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,810
especially with how much
you've all been eating.

368
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,133
- Well hard work builds
an appetite, Marion.

369
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,730
Now, who have you brought into my temple?

370
00:27:09,290 --> 00:27:12,850
- Your temple, Professor?

371
00:27:12,850 --> 00:27:15,813
- My temple, my dig
site, you get the idea.

372
00:27:18,544 --> 00:27:22,480
- Meet my friends, Maxy and Gab-E.

373
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,893
They are on a pilgrimage.

374
00:27:25,030 --> 00:27:26,680
- Bitchin' top.

375
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,993
I got one just like it.

376
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,203
- Right.

377
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:38,070
They didn't have any clothes,
so they had to borrow ours.

378
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,920
- What? That's my daxin reverb top?

379
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,640
- Sorry, Pim.

380
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,930
But, hey, I figured we're trying to get

381
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,670
to know the indigenous population.

382
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,320
After all, we thought this
moon was abandoned, right?

383
00:27:53,689 --> 00:27:56,440
I mean, when I found them,

384
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,610
they were naked and shameless.

385
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:02,923
- Yes, very interesting.

386
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,950
Please see to it that
they are well tended.

387
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:12,713
Now if you'll excuse me, I
will retire to my quarters.

388
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,168
(soft music)

389
00:28:17,168 --> 00:28:21,085
- Guys, these are my
classmates, Jeetz and Pim.

390
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,040
We are on a research
grant from our university

391
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,803
to study your goddess
and how great she is.

392
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,252
Or isn't.

393
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:32,960
- Marion, can I talk to
you alone for a minute?

394
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,240
- Anything you've got to say to me,

395
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,340
you can say in front of my friends here.

396
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,173
- Really?

397
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:39,920
Anything I could possibly
have to say to my life mate

398
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,480
I can say in front of these two strangers

399
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,240
you met 15 paraclicks ago?

400
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,943
- Sure, why not?

401
00:28:45,995 --> 00:28:47,763
- Okay, well,

402
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,980
when I was making love to Pim,
I didn't think of you once.

403
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,460
I feel terrible about
that, but it's the truth.

404
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,600
Oh God, it was like
fucking a five-alarm fire.

405
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,433
I was really in the moment,

406
00:28:58,433 --> 00:29:00,250
like I haven't been in ages with you.

407
00:29:02,395 --> 00:29:05,850
- How could you say that in
front of all these people?

408
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,117
- Because I want to understand, Marion.

409
00:29:07,117 --> 00:29:09,050
I want to know why.

410
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,473
I love you, Marion!

411
00:29:12,357 --> 00:29:15,274
(soft piano music)

412
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,920
- So are you like the
mongrel stud around here?

413
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,023
- We came in search of a strong
presence of a sexual nature.

414
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,670
But you're not it.

415
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,160
- Hey, I do all right.

416
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,240
- I'm sure you do, and
I would have you soon,

417
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,090
but you are not the presence we seek.

418
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:37,680
- It is nearby, though.

419
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:42,380
- You know something. You've seen it.

420
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,623
- Listen, Maxy, is it?

421
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,340
You wanna see something?

422
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,330
- I would like that, yes.

423
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:52,053
- You come with me.
I'll show you something.

424
00:29:53,306 --> 00:29:55,240
And don't worry about her.

425
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,100
My buddy Jeetz is gonna
show her something too.

426
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,150
Something she won't soon forget.

427
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,350
- Are you gonna be okay?

428
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,810
- Yeah, I think I gotta
do something a little

429
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,360
different to get his attention.

430
00:30:08,259 --> 00:30:10,842
(upbeat music)

431
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,383
- So, Pim just talks big, you know.

432
00:30:22,383 --> 00:30:25,090
I don't want you to get
the wrong idea about me.

433
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,443
Marion is actually my ...

434
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:28,629
My li ...

435
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:33,540
- My friend and I are here to collect

436
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,230
erotic intel and experiences.

437
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,350
I understand that not
all species may share

438
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:40,163
in erotic experiences freely.

439
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,800
If your bond with Marion
prevents you from sharing with me

440
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,610
in an erotic manner, please
accept this handshake

441
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,893
as a token of my regard.

442
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,780
That was a direct quote
from the Alterian Code

443
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,033
of Interspecies
Fornication, Article Three.

444
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,068
Are you okay?

445
00:30:58,068 --> 00:31:00,818
(hard breathing)

446
00:31:04,011 --> 00:31:06,428
(soft music)

447
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,737
- [Pim] This was a sacred place
to the ancient Thanagarians.

448
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,779
- Yes, I can see that.

449
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,980
(soft music)

450
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,500
- I was hoping, maybe,

451
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,130
you could help us decipher some of this.

452
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:19,700
You are from this system, aren't you?

453
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,063
- In a way, yes.

454
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,453
- Is it your religion?

455
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,170
Does it vibe with what you
know about the All Mother?

456
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:34,008
(soft upbeat music)

457
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,560
You guys can bunk here tonight.

458
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,423
It's not long on comfort, or charm.

459
00:33:07,650 --> 00:33:10,340
The shaman wasn't much of an artist.

460
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,883
Arms are kinda noodly.

461
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:17,873
And I can't tell if she's
hugging them or strangling them.

462
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,170
- Tentacles everywhere. Very erotic.

463
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:25,143
- You really seem to be into that. Yeah.

464
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,593
- Very enlightening.

465
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,033
- Yes, I figured they were
significant in your religion.

466
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,793
- Of course.

467
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:37,210
(soft music)

468
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:42,073
- Give you any ideas?

469
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,390
- Very stimulating.

470
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:49,960
- Good, because there's more.

471
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,960
(soft upbeat music)

472
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:03,288
(mysterious music)

473
00:34:03,288 --> 00:34:06,203
(sobbing)

474
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:08,360
(soft piano music)

475
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,577
- Hey, Gorgeous.

476
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:11,343
Why so glum?

477
00:34:12,768 --> 00:34:13,968
- You know why I'm glum.

478
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:18,963
Jeetz and Pim are having an affair,

479
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:23,820
and they're not, not even
bothering to hide it.

480
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:25,783
- Ah.

481
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:30,398
Those two lovebirds can't keep
their hands off each other.

482
00:34:30,398 --> 00:34:32,565
(sobbing)

483
00:34:36,977 --> 00:34:39,710
- Can you do something about it?

484
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,713
You're the professor.

485
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:45,093
Isn't it against the rules or something?

486
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:48,283
- There's no rules that I know of.

487
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:53,091
I can't impinge on their rights, Marion.

488
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,591
It's not my place.

489
00:34:55,651 --> 00:34:59,373
In fact, I find it very arousing.

490
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:02,302
Oh.

491
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,893
- Everyone here is a sex maniac but me.

492
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:14,630
- Well, he is the only
man on the expedition.

493
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,603
It was bound to happen eventually.

494
00:35:19,822 --> 00:35:22,860
- Did,

495
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,050
did you ever?

496
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:24,883
- No.

497
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:28,980
I mean, I considered it,
just for a change of pace.

498
00:35:30,750 --> 00:35:34,963
Jeetz is especially ragged
and unkempt, even for a man.

499
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,300
I prefer my playthings pretty

500
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,033
and sweet smelling.

501
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:44,703
- Oh.

502
00:35:45,674 --> 00:35:47,630
Oh, I don't know.

503
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:50,223
I've never, I've never done that before.

504
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,713
- Well, you may as well get used to it.

505
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,190
I think Pim will have your man's attention

506
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,190
for quite some time.

507
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,310
And your new friends, they
look curious and hungry.

508
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:05,210
They may want a turn with him as well.

509
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,540
- I suppose I brought that on myself.

510
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,027
- Yes, but we can have our own fun.

511
00:36:13,027 --> 00:36:15,360
(sniffling)

512
00:36:19,939 --> 00:36:20,772
- I

513
00:36:21,630 --> 00:36:22,463
guess.

514
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,890
If it's all I've got for a while.

515
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,330
- That's it, Marion.

516
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,897
As they say in the tungsten
mines of Arcar Genesi,

517
00:36:35,759 --> 00:36:37,924
love the one you're with.

518
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:40,341
(soft music)

519
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,983
- This does not bode well.

520
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,010
These images harken the
return of the All Mother,

521
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:00,053
the world devourer.

522
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,830
- Primitive superstition,
merely an ancient

523
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,400
excuse for an orgy party.

524
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,630
- The Thanagarian sex eater will reawaken,

525
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,070
just as the prophecies foretold.

526
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,610
And she will usher in oblivion,

527
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,413
the beast which can't be fed.

528
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,690
We must proceed with caution,

529
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,750
lest we endanger our
operatives and bring about

530
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:21,860
the end of the galaxy as we know it.

531
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,220
- But you must admit, Council,

532
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,610
the tentacles are universally appealing.

533
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:27,500
- The Goddess is not without her charms,

534
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:30,300
but the temple is no place
for fledgling collectors.

535
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,650
- We will pull them from the field

536
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,590
until we have studied the matter further.

537
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,100
- And we'll pray on all things erotic

538
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,373
that we are not too late.

539
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:39,310
I don't dare consider
what tortures our agents

540
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:40,860
have already been subjected to.

541
00:37:41,902 --> 00:37:44,152
(laughing)

542
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:49,413
- I've never met a Thanagarian before.

543
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:52,300
Are you all mega hotties?

544
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,108
- Of course.

545
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:56,525
(soft music)

546
00:37:59,959 --> 00:38:02,749
(thunder rumbling)

547
00:38:02,749 --> 00:38:06,582
- Oh, this sure has been
a strange expedition.

548
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:08,363
That's for sure.

549
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:12,118
(soft music)

550
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:26,363
(splashing)

551
00:38:29,605 --> 00:38:32,180
(splashing)

552
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:35,410
Maybe this cavern isn't
as secure as we thought.

553
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,490
- Let's retire to the surface.

554
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,848
- Good idea.

555
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:41,265
(soft music)

556
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:52,993
- I want you to join
me in the Throne Room,

557
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,846
and I want you to wear this.

558
00:38:56,846 --> 00:38:59,263
(soft music)

559
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:08,653
- That's nice.

560
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:12,470
Do you think it's
appropriate for fieldwork?

561
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:14,930
- You want to impress him, don't you?

562
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,870
Clean yourself up and put this on.

563
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:19,919
Join me at the throne in 20 paraclicks.

564
00:39:19,919 --> 00:39:22,489
(dress zipping)

565
00:39:22,489 --> 00:39:25,822
(soft mysterious music)

566
00:39:51,276 --> 00:39:52,650
- We saw some very interesting things

567
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,500
down there, Gab-E, very enlightening.

568
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:58,043
(soft music)

569
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,273
- Do tell.

570
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:06,349
(soft upbeat music)

571
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,260
That was sure nice of them
to put us up for the evening.

572
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,690
- Yes, we should thank them
properly in the morning.

573
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:31,250
- With sexual favors?

574
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,193
- Of course.

575
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,050
- I slept with a man today.

576
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:41,220
- Yes, Earth slang for sexual intercourse.

577
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,010
I prefer porking.

578
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:46,523
- No, I mean I actually slept with him.

579
00:40:46,523 --> 00:40:47,923
I had dreams and everything.

580
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:53,460
They were really strange and super kinky.

581
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,200
- Alterians don't sleep,

582
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,690
and we have no subconscious
in which to dream.

583
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,890
Although I believe I
understand the concept.

584
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,070
- I think all that sex took it outta me.

585
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:04,700
I'm bushed.

586
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,730
- We're beings of pure energy.

587
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:08,017
Sex can't take anything out of you.

588
00:41:08,017 --> 00:41:09,800
That's not how this works.

589
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,460
- Well how do you know?
Have you ever had it?

590
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,300
- Yes, just now with
the one they call Pim.

591
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,133
- Ah.

592
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,163
I guess that counts.

593
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,483
- How does it not?

594
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:28,890
- Well, you're a female, she's a female.

595
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,343
- And she pleased me and I her.

596
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,108
As they say in the Calomber
Casino, dealer's choice.

597
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:38,859
(upbeat music)

598
00:41:38,859 --> 00:41:41,026
(moaning)

599
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,357
- Please, students.

600
00:41:48,721 --> 00:41:50,083
A bit of decorum.

601
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:54,623
We have an honored guest joining us.

602
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,460
I see the pod has been
well fed in my absence.

603
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,983
- Yes, Professor. She especially
enjoys her new guests.

604
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,670
- I don't know if it's appropriate

605
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:12,693
you call me Professor anymore.

606
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:16,340
I feel my duties have shifted,

607
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,283
and with them, so should my title.

608
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:22,710
We are rebuilding an empire, after all.

609
00:42:22,710 --> 00:42:23,583
Therefore,

610
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,063
Empress Dara'Tel seems only fitting.

611
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:34,993
Yes, she likes that.

612
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:39,973
Kneel, my subjects.

613
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:44,541
Kneel before your empress!

614
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:46,958
(soft music)

615
00:42:57,917 --> 00:42:58,750
Yes.

616
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:02,187
Here she is now.

617
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,650
- Doesn't Marion have to kneel?

618
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:08,303
- No, fool.

619
00:43:09,570 --> 00:43:12,350
This is my princess.

620
00:43:12,350 --> 00:43:15,743
From now on, you will kneel to her.

621
00:43:16,770 --> 00:43:19,373
- None of this is necessary.

622
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,433
Really.

623
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,533
- Come forth, Princess Marion.

624
00:43:25,830 --> 00:43:28,320
Take your place at my side.

625
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:32,280
- Marion, look at you. You
never looked so hot before.

626
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,580
- Shut up, Jeetz. You've had your chance.

627
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,980
- We really should talk, baby.

628
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,770
All I can think about is doing you again.

629
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:38,730
- Silence!

630
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,423
Both of you, avert your eyes.

631
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,633
She is royalty now, and you are nothing.

632
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,943
The pod commands it.

633
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,543
- What's the pod?

634
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,923
- You will know soon enough, my dear.

635
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:58,690
Come closer.

636
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,490
You'll see for yourself.

637
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:02,907
(soft music)

638
00:44:05,260 --> 00:44:07,973
- I don't know about this.

639
00:44:08,810 --> 00:44:12,540
You've all been acting
strange since we got here.

640
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:14,580
I mean, the professor's on a power trip,

641
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:18,230
and you two are treating
this expedition like

642
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:23,080
some sort of, sexpedition.

643
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,460
It's freaking me all out!

644
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:27,010
- Should we brace her, Empress?

645
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:28,963
- No.

646
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,073
Let her go.

647
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:37,320
But I like that you are
taking this well, Pim.

648
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,783
Very good.

649
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:41,200
(soft music)

650
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,970
Empress Dara'Tel seems only fitting.

651
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:48,350
Kneel before your
empress! You are nothing.

652
00:44:48,350 --> 00:44:51,077
Avert your eyes. The pod commands it.

653
00:44:51,077 --> 00:44:55,458
- Whoa, this Empress
Dara'Tel's off her nut.

654
00:44:55,458 --> 00:44:57,660
Are you getting this? Gab-E?

655
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:01,070
- Yes, the crazy ones
make the best lovers.

656
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,410
I'll pursue her first
thing in the morning.

657
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,880
- Be that as it may, there
seems to be more afoot here

658
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,580
than our little sexual side wager.

659
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:11,511
(soft piano music)

660
00:45:12,638 --> 00:45:15,055
- Maxy, Gab-E, can I come in?

661
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:19,383
It's me, Marion.

662
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,163
- Hey, Marion.

663
00:45:22,031 --> 00:45:24,271
- You guys are here.

664
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:25,321
- Hey, Marion.

665
00:45:25,321 --> 00:45:27,821
(light music)

666
00:45:34,511 --> 00:45:36,420
(sobbing)

667
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:39,873
- Everyone in this place
is so weird, except for me.

668
00:45:41,210 --> 00:45:42,850
- How do you mean?

669
00:45:42,850 --> 00:45:47,363
- Well, you two are okay, I guess.

670
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,993
A little dim is all.

671
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,143
- You're okay by me too, Marion.

672
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:58,153
- But my research crew,
ever since we got here,

673
00:45:59,170 --> 00:46:02,170
they've been acting
stranger by the metaclick.

674
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:03,683
Must be this place.

675
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:08,810
It's getting to them somehow.

676
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:10,910
- I think you may be onto something.

677
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:13,790
There's a cavern beneath this
temple that I must show you.

678
00:46:13,790 --> 00:46:16,383
- You mean the subterranean genesis pools?

679
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:19,744
Aren't they beautiful?

680
00:46:19,744 --> 00:46:23,260
- Yes, but there's
something developing there

681
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,010
that we should investigate further.

682
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,913
- Bikini time!

683
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,870
(soft music)

684
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,113
Come on, guys.

685
00:46:37,770 --> 00:46:38,983
Bikini time?

686
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:44,258
I need this.

687
00:46:44,258 --> 00:46:46,675
(soft music)

688
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:51,373
- The pod tires of you.

689
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:55,283
Fetch me my princess.

690
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:58,970
- Uh, we got company, Empress.

691
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,370
I think it's that soylent paste freighter.

692
00:47:01,370 --> 00:47:05,360
- Yes, the slurry to feed
our little worker bees

693
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,783
and keep the hive going.

694
00:47:07,870 --> 00:47:09,470
Is he close?

695
00:47:09,470 --> 00:47:10,620
- Landing now, Empress.

696
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:15,913
- Pim, prepare for our new guest.

697
00:47:17,230 --> 00:47:19,493
Let's give him what he came for.

698
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:21,733
- Yes, Empress.

699
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,860
- Gab-E, are you sure that
bikinis are the best garb

700
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,820
for a subterfuge like this one?

701
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:33,900
- Yes, Maxy, it's the perfect cover.

702
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:36,373
Just a few sassy ladies
out for a midnight swim.

703
00:47:40,180 --> 00:47:41,661
Let's go.

704
00:47:41,661 --> 00:47:44,244
(upbeat music)

705
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,520
- The vines are progressing.

706
00:47:59,328 --> 00:48:00,560
(splashing)

707
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,233
- The cavern is cracking
apart. I can hear it.

708
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,250
- Come over here. I'll show you something.

709
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,170
- Guys, I don't think it's safe.

710
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,423
- Oh, Marion, you bleat like cattle.

711
00:48:16,170 --> 00:48:18,870
No wonder your lover has abandoned you.

712
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:21,890
- That was a little
harsh, wasn't it, Maxy?

713
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,873
- No, she's right.

714
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:28,713
If I'm gonna be any good for this team,

715
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:31,870
I've gotta get it together.

716
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:32,703
- Okay then.

717
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,173
Look there, under the water.

718
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,640
It's these pods that have been
dropping from the ceiling.

719
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,510
There must be a dozen of them.

720
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,383
- Wow, I see. Let's take a closer look.

721
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:48,773
- Sounds good, guys.

722
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:52,760
I'll just be up here keeping a lookout.

723
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:55,147
- Thank you, Marion. You do that.

724
00:49:00,047 --> 00:49:02,492
(water lapping)

725
00:49:02,492 --> 00:49:05,409
(mysterious music)

726
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:10,683
- You are really going
to enjoy our grotto.

727
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:13,293
Just up ahead.

728
00:49:13,293 --> 00:49:16,260
- Miss, you are very lovely,
but I got a freight of slurry

729
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:17,990
out there that aint getting any fresher.

730
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,950
So, if we could, as they say
in the Grail Star Cluster,

731
00:49:21,950 --> 00:49:25,750
get down to the get down,
I'll be on my merry way.

732
00:49:25,750 --> 00:49:28,330
- Don't you want a grand
tour of our facilities?

733
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:31,830
- Lady, I got eight penises
that need satisfaction.

734
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,690
This is gonna take long enough as it is.

735
00:49:33,690 --> 00:49:35,690
So I suggest we get down to brass tacks.

736
00:49:36,990 --> 00:49:39,470
- Pim, do we have a new guest?

737
00:49:39,470 --> 00:49:43,070
- You got the king of the cosmic
convoy, Blue Hugh Mongous.

738
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:44,163
- How enchanting.

739
00:49:45,274 --> 00:49:46,790
- Captain of my tub.

740
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:47,750
- I'm Dara'Tel.

741
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:49,077
- Ooh, ah.

742
00:49:49,077 --> 00:49:52,150
(nibbling)

743
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:52,983
- Pleasure.

744
00:49:53,925 --> 00:49:54,758
- Yeah.

745
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:59,660
- I would like to welcome you
to our newest attraction here

746
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:01,863
at the Thanagarian bordello.

747
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,473
- Now.

748
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,160
You just sit down, get
comfortable and enjoy the show.

749
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:19,298
(water bubbling)

750
00:50:19,298 --> 00:50:21,715
(soft music)

751
00:50:38,594 --> 00:50:40,887
(Blue laughing)

752
00:50:40,887 --> 00:50:43,887
- Ooh, ah (laughs).

753
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:49,233
- We got pods.

754
00:50:50,188 --> 00:50:51,021
- Quiet.

755
00:50:51,973 --> 00:50:54,210
Dara'Tel and Pim are over with some

756
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,173
freighter pilot they lured here.

757
00:50:57,290 --> 00:51:00,353
- I got one for you too,
Marion, so we can each have one.

758
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,310
- Thank you, Gab-E.

759
00:51:03,398 --> 00:51:04,231
Please.

760
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:06,413
Be quiet.

761
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:13,003
- Marion, these friends of
yours are very interesting.

762
00:51:15,397 --> 00:51:17,980
(upbeat music)

763
00:51:29,332 --> 00:51:31,932
(Blue laughing)

764
00:51:31,932 --> 00:51:34,515
(upbeat music)

765
00:51:37,392 --> 00:51:41,309
- Okay, I have no idea
where this is going now.

766
00:51:44,190 --> 00:51:46,923
- I'd venture a guess that
it's going somewhere sensual.

767
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,913
- What are you guys?

768
00:51:52,339 --> 00:51:53,933
- All will be explained in time.

769
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,913
- Ooh, how lucky are we today?

770
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:08,463
Our body heat has
attracted some native one.

771
00:52:10,256 --> 00:52:13,840
- Oh, hey now, what are these
squishy little critters?

772
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,190
- Impudent cur!

773
00:52:15,190 --> 00:52:17,310
How dare you kick the seeds of a god?

774
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:22,000
- What she means to say is,
this is a protected species.

775
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,283
- [Blue] Is that a fact?

776
00:52:24,450 --> 00:52:27,070
- This is a Thanagarian pleasure pod.

777
00:52:27,070 --> 00:52:28,653
Just give it a little tickle,

778
00:52:29,651 --> 00:52:31,623
and it'll give you all the feels.

779
00:52:32,690 --> 00:52:36,220
- I don't want no funny stuff.
Just girls, and lots of them.

780
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,544
What do I look like, some kinda freak?

781
00:52:38,544 --> 00:52:42,110
- Just tickle the damn
pleasure pods, you ugly squid.

782
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,710
- All right, okay. You don't
need to get ornery now.

783
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,387
- Doesn't it feel good?

784
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:52,207
- Not bad. Not so bad at all.

785
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:56,470
- Would you like to try another?

786
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,913
- Ooh.

787
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,250
- [Pim] Maybe just one more.

788
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:05,469
(Blue laughing)

789
00:53:05,469 --> 00:53:07,782
- Woo, woo, oh, woo.

790
00:53:07,782 --> 00:53:08,615
- [Dara'Tel] Another.

791
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:10,386
- Whoa, whoa, whoa whoa whoa.

792
00:53:10,386 --> 00:53:11,219
Whoa.

793
00:53:11,219 --> 00:53:12,886
- Blue Hugh Mongous?

794
00:53:14,379 --> 00:53:18,531
You finally found me
after all these miles.

795
00:53:18,531 --> 00:53:20,031
Blue Hugh Mongous,

796
00:53:21,635 --> 00:53:24,590
do you like my babies, Blue Hugh Mongous?

797
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:26,116
- Oh, too many for old Blue.

798
00:53:26,116 --> 00:53:26,949
Whoa, ho.

799
00:53:28,055 --> 00:53:30,388
Whoa, come on, come on down!

800
00:53:32,247 --> 00:53:35,580
(soft mysterious music)

801
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:41,513
- See, Pim, that's why I
don't fool around with males.

802
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,408
No stamina.

803
00:53:46,408 --> 00:53:49,154
- (laughs) Oh.

804
00:53:49,154 --> 00:53:51,404
(laughing)

805
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:08,631
(pods squeaking)

806
00:54:08,631 --> 00:54:10,881
(laughing)

807
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:16,860
- Should we do something
about our friend here?

808
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:19,941
- Oh, whatever. He was a dick anyways.

809
00:54:19,941 --> 00:54:21,491
Are we still talking about him?

810
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:26,221
Oh shit, I love these pods.

811
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,638
(soft music)

812
00:54:29,932 --> 00:54:32,182
(laughing)

813
00:54:34,629 --> 00:54:37,962
(soft mysterious music)

814
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:48,552
- Did you see that?

815
00:54:49,823 --> 00:54:53,000
I think they just killed that guy.

816
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,420
- Maxy, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

817
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,903
- We share a hive mind.

818
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:01,721
So yes.

819
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:04,138
(soft music)

820
00:55:07,802 --> 00:55:10,469
(pods squeaking)

821
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:12,886
(soft music)

822
00:55:17,513 --> 00:55:20,263
(dramatic music)

823
00:55:24,418 --> 00:55:26,585
(gasping)

824
00:55:27,604 --> 00:55:30,021
(soft music)

825
00:55:33,259 --> 00:55:35,509
(giggling)

826
00:55:37,474 --> 00:55:39,807
(whooshing)

827
00:55:42,281 --> 00:55:44,980
(whooshing)

828
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:48,313
(soft mysterious music)

829
00:55:49,339 --> 00:55:51,506
(sobbing)

830
00:55:53,205 --> 00:55:55,872
(pod squeaking)

831
00:56:05,823 --> 00:56:07,113
- Hey, cutie.

832
00:56:08,810 --> 00:56:10,343
Are you trying to cheer me up?

833
00:56:11,466 --> 00:56:13,883
(soft music)

834
00:56:15,636 --> 00:56:18,303
(pod squeaking)

835
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,516
Who's the precious little pod?

836
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:33,120
- All right, the coast is clear,

837
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:34,700
so let's just walk in business.

838
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:35,950
I'll see you in our room.

839
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:40,063
- Oh God. Why can't I bounce?

840
00:56:40,915 --> 00:56:41,748
(Dara'Tel laughing)

841
00:56:41,748 --> 00:56:45,060
- [Dara'Tel] My darling Pim,
if I didn't know any better,

842
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,053
I'd say you were sweet on
our large blue friend here.

843
00:56:49,060 --> 00:56:51,489
- [Pim] Eh, I've done worse.

844
00:56:51,489 --> 00:56:53,680
(soft mysterious music)

845
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,726
- Hello.

846
00:56:54,726 --> 00:56:58,059
(soft mysterious music)

847
00:57:02,010 --> 00:57:02,843
Hello.

848
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,353
Oh.

849
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,253
If I can't bounce, what can I do?

850
00:57:15,546 --> 00:57:18,129
(upbeat music)

851
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,463
- Marion, the professor,

852
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:42,503
Empress, has been looking for you.

853
00:57:43,923 --> 00:57:48,923
- Professor Empress knows
where to find me, doesn't she?

854
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:53,213
- No, I think that was the issue.

855
00:57:54,646 --> 00:57:57,803
- Well, I'm right here.

856
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:01,143
- I see that.

857
00:58:03,530 --> 00:58:05,480
- And?

858
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:06,603
What about you?

859
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:11,740
Did you still wanna have that little chat?

860
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:12,923
- Do I ever.

861
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,845
- Well then why don't you come over here

862
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:21,638
and tell me what you've gotta say?

863
00:58:21,638 --> 00:58:24,222
(upbeat music)

864
00:58:24,222 --> 00:58:26,803
(pod squeaking)

865
00:58:26,803 --> 00:58:29,386
(upbeat music)

866
00:58:34,297 --> 00:58:35,753
(Marion moaning)

867
00:58:35,753 --> 00:58:38,420
(pod squeaking)

868
00:58:46,550 --> 00:58:47,923
- Is someone there?

869
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,920
- Auxiliary 8127, do you read me?

870
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,453
It is I, Alterian High Council the First.

871
00:58:55,510 --> 00:58:57,700
- Do I know you?

872
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,330
- Not in this form, but we have
met in the council chambers.

873
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:03,370
The High Council was
concerned that you and Maxy

874
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:05,670
were in over your heads,
and I'm here to help.

875
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,443
- Okay, what's your designation?

876
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:12,370
- You know, in all the commotion,
we failed to assign one.

877
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,320
I haven't been in the field in so long.

878
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:18,000
- Hey, since you're a
member of the High Council,

879
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,223
we can call you Hi-Co.

880
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,700
- Hi-Co.

881
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:22,533
I like it.

882
00:59:22,533 --> 00:59:27,410
- These visitors, where do they come from?

883
00:59:28,350 --> 00:59:30,130
- I figured they were locals.

884
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:32,250
I couldn't imagine either
of those two dipshits

885
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:34,160
piloting a star cruiser.

886
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:34,993
- Nah.

887
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,550
I'm not buying that local yokel story

888
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,850
for a new court paraclick.

889
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,250
No, there's more to these
interlopers than meets the eye.

890
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:47,210
These are ancient beings of great power.

891
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,110
- You can tell just by looking at them?

892
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,780
- I know this, because the pod knows this.

893
00:59:54,113 --> 00:59:57,103
The pod craves their power,
but has used them as well.

894
00:59:59,048 --> 01:00:02,590
We must tread lightly with
these strange visitors.

895
01:00:04,192 --> 01:00:07,525
(soft mysterious music)

896
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:15,403
- It's just as we suspected.

897
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,937
You're dealing with a godly power here,

898
01:00:18,937 --> 01:00:21,030
and your cover is blown.

899
01:00:21,030 --> 01:00:22,560
- Is there somewhere safe we can boost?

900
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:23,800
- I can't boost.

901
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,083
I don't, I don't know
what's wrong with me.

902
01:00:28,460 --> 01:00:29,423
- I feel it too.

903
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,133
Something in this temple
is draining our powers.

904
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:37,963
Here, come close to me.

905
01:00:42,382 --> 01:00:44,942
- Ooh, so warm and tingly.

906
01:00:44,942 --> 01:00:47,359
(soft music)

907
01:00:55,832 --> 01:00:59,420
- Gab-E, where were you?
And who the hell is this?

908
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:02,563
- Alterian High Council the
First, field designation Hi-Co.

909
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:08,303
- I couldn't boost. Hi-Co
saved me with her power hug.

910
01:01:09,470 --> 01:01:11,650
- I must confess, it would
have worked with a mere touch

911
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,720
of the hand, but I find your form pleasing

912
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,600
and I took advantage of the situation.

913
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,840
For that, I apologize.

914
01:01:18,840 --> 01:01:22,070
- That's okay, Hi-Co. I
find your form pleasing too.

915
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,970
Maybe later we can get to
know each other better.

916
01:01:24,970 --> 01:01:26,570
- I'd like that, Gab-E.

917
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:30,610
- Yeah, well, as they say
in the Motel Stars area,

918
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,160
get a room, you two.

919
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,410
But get it somewhere else.
We're leaving tonight.

920
01:01:35,410 --> 01:01:38,223
- No, we have to stay and
fix the damage we've done.

921
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,010
- It's funny a High
Council member would forget

922
01:01:42,010 --> 01:01:44,490
the Alterian Code of Noninterference.

923
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,080
- [Hi-Co] Yes, Collector
Maxy, but you may have noticed

924
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,490
strange activity here recently.

925
01:01:49,490 --> 01:01:51,470
- Yeah, you could say that again.

926
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:53,070
- Well these events have been accelerated

927
01:01:53,070 --> 01:01:54,610
by your presence here.

928
01:01:54,610 --> 01:01:56,210
We are in the lair of an ancient beast

929
01:01:56,210 --> 01:01:59,150
that has been feeding off
people since we've arrived.

930
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:01,340
- I think I would have
noticed if an ancient beast

931
01:02:01,340 --> 01:02:03,270
was feeding off of me.

932
01:02:03,270 --> 01:02:06,020
- Have you tried using your powers lately?

933
01:02:06,020 --> 01:02:08,170
The council has been unable to reach you.

934
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:09,370
Can you connect to them?

935
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:13,720
- I can't.

936
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:16,830
I can't see anything past the temple.

937
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,810
- I can even feel my vast
energy slowly dwindle

938
01:02:21,810 --> 01:02:23,363
as the beast grows in power.

939
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:26,550
What took hundreds of
years in empire building

940
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,250
is done in a matter of days with you two

941
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:31,830
Alterian energy cows loafing around.

942
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:33,260
- Hey.

943
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,960
- The energy cow is worshiped
as a god in some faiths.

944
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,750
I'll take it as a compliment.

945
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:41,533
- We have to fix the mess we've made.

946
01:02:43,110 --> 01:02:45,610
- Can't we just boost back to domicile

947
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,950
and let Marion and the gang sort it out?

948
01:02:47,950 --> 01:02:49,903
They seem like a capable bunch.

949
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,780
- The Thanagarian pod
beast is a world devourer,

950
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,000
a planet ender.

951
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,830
It won't stop at Thanagar.

952
01:02:58,830 --> 01:03:01,570
It will continue across the
galaxy just as it did before

953
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:02,970
and they'll be nothing left.

954
01:03:03,840 --> 01:03:07,080
We won't be leaving this
to Marion and the gang.

955
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,800
We'll destroy this
monster, and we'll return

956
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,270
to Alteria for a hero's welcome.

957
01:03:11,270 --> 01:03:12,883
- How do you suppose we do that?

958
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,550
- We give the bitch what she wants.

959
01:03:17,565 --> 01:03:20,898
(soft mysterious music)

960
01:03:33,853 --> 01:03:36,436
(upbeat music)

961
01:03:45,921 --> 01:03:48,974
- [All Mother] Our last union.

962
01:03:48,974 --> 01:03:51,557
(upbeat music)

963
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:22,039
(upbeat rock music)

964
01:04:36,947 --> 01:04:39,197
(laughing)

965
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:43,970
- [Pim] Am I supposed to be here?

966
01:04:45,033 --> 01:04:48,366
(soft mysterious music)

967
01:04:51,923 --> 01:04:54,756
(water trickling)

968
01:04:55,757 --> 01:04:57,640
- We seek an audience with the empress.

969
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,953
- Wait, there is three of you now?

970
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,530
- This is Hi-Co. She's new.

971
01:05:03,530 --> 01:05:05,830
- [Jeetz] Hi-Co pleases the pod.

972
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:06,713
- Do I?

973
01:05:08,190 --> 01:05:10,603
- I don't really know. The
pod doesn't talk to me much.

974
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:17,040
- You guys really went to
town on that protein slurry.

975
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:20,170
- It's hungry work, building an empire.

976
01:05:20,170 --> 01:05:22,370
- This is what you call an empire?

977
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:25,309
It looks like an outer
colony poo hatch den.

978
01:05:25,309 --> 01:05:29,070
- This place is straight outer colony.

979
01:05:29,070 --> 01:05:29,903
- Hey.

980
01:05:30,940 --> 01:05:33,100
We're getting stronger every day.

981
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,885
You'll see.

982
01:05:37,885 --> 01:05:39,385
- Someone is here.

983
01:05:41,670 --> 01:05:44,587
Beast of great and delicious power.

984
01:05:45,945 --> 01:05:48,112
(hissing)

985
01:05:51,860 --> 01:05:54,070
- We seek an audience with Her Majesty,

986
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:56,330
Dara'Tel, the Empress of Thanagar.

987
01:05:56,330 --> 01:05:58,050
First child of the All Mother,

988
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:01,320
herald to the world eater
and voice of the pod.

989
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:03,040
- I'm listening.

990
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,020
Maxy, is it?

991
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,610
- Alterian Collective Unit 4878.

992
01:06:07,610 --> 01:06:10,760
Field designation Maxy Prime.

993
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,573
- Alterian Collective, you say?

994
01:06:13,727 --> 01:06:15,577
All of you?

995
01:06:18,610 --> 01:06:21,490
You masquerade as common pilgrims.

996
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,710
You think the pod couldn't
sniff out your powers,

997
01:06:25,710 --> 01:06:27,070
but we knew you were special

998
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,280
before you even entered this temple.

999
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:32,493
Such is the glory of the pod.

1000
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,500
- We Alterians worship
great power above all else,

1001
01:06:37,500 --> 01:06:39,933
especially that of an
erotic and carnal nature.

1002
01:06:40,890 --> 01:06:43,480
We sensed the pod's
lusty energies from afar,

1003
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:46,000
and we are here seeking union with her.

1004
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,823
- The Goddess seeks no union.

1005
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,193
She only wishes to consume.

1006
01:06:52,070 --> 01:06:55,766
- And so we shall live on
in the belly of the Goddess.

1007
01:06:55,766 --> 01:06:57,440
- We are beings of pure energy.

1008
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,930
As you know, energy cannot be destroyed.

1009
01:06:59,930 --> 01:07:01,800
It merely changes form.

1010
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:04,300
- It is our place in the cosmic dance.

1011
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:06,150
- [Hi-Co] We are not
bound by flesh as you are,

1012
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:08,830
Dara'Tel of the Scholastica
Infitum Sanctorum.

1013
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:10,963
- The sanctorum is far behind me now.

1014
01:07:11,840 --> 01:07:12,673
Here,

1015
01:07:14,350 --> 01:07:16,730
I am an empress.

1016
01:07:16,730 --> 01:07:19,760
- Then grant we fulfill
our destiny, Empress.

1017
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,020
A union between the pod
and the Alterian Collective

1018
01:07:22,020 --> 01:07:24,360
could be just the thing to
spread her glorious spore

1019
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,320
across the expanse of time and space.

1020
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:29,633
- The Goddess does not need
your union to spread her spore.

1021
01:07:31,280 --> 01:07:32,113
But still,

1022
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:35,363
you intrigue the pod.

1023
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:39,950
You will be first.

1024
01:07:39,950 --> 01:07:41,233
- With honor, Empress.

1025
01:07:42,829 --> 01:07:44,823
- Uh-uh, uh-uh, hold on.

1026
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,113
Slowly.

1027
01:07:49,058 --> 01:07:51,934
The pod enjoys a show.

1028
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:55,017
(upbeat dance music)

1029
01:08:26,500 --> 01:08:29,137
(soft whooshing)

1030
01:08:29,137 --> 01:08:32,220
(upbeat dance music)

1031
01:08:38,454 --> 01:08:41,213
(soft whooshing)

1032
01:08:41,213 --> 01:08:44,296
(upbeat dance music)

1033
01:08:50,341 --> 01:08:53,024
(soft whooshing)

1034
01:08:53,024 --> 01:08:56,107
(upbeat dance music)

1035
01:09:02,106 --> 01:09:05,106
(upbeat rock music)

1036
01:09:09,882 --> 01:09:12,715
(soft rock music)

1037
01:09:32,158 --> 01:09:34,991
(cavern cracking)

1038
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:49,398
(soft music)

1039
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:56,030
- Empress, are we thinking
enough is enough here?

1040
01:09:56,030 --> 01:10:00,293
- No, we will just feel
the energy flowing.

1041
01:10:02,232 --> 01:10:06,370
The power coursing through the tentacles.

1042
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:07,593
- Yeah, I feel it.

1043
01:10:07,593 --> 01:10:09,600
It's gonna bring this whole temple down.

1044
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:14,600
- Pim, this temple has
stood for an eternity,

1045
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,323
and it's gonna stand
for an eternity longer.

1046
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:21,523
- Okay.

1047
01:10:22,683 --> 01:10:25,443
I'm just gonna run some
trash out to the pile.

1048
01:10:26,654 --> 01:10:29,071
(soft music)

1049
01:10:32,430 --> 01:10:34,063
- Never mind them, my love.

1050
01:10:35,340 --> 01:10:36,173
Join me.

1051
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:41,460
As we usher in

1052
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:44,665
a new age.

1053
01:10:45,793 --> 01:10:48,210
(soft music)

1054
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:51,363
My Goddess, no!

1055
01:11:00,867 --> 01:11:04,478
(blaster whirring)

1056
01:11:04,478 --> 01:11:07,478
(soft upbeat music)

1057
01:11:11,660 --> 01:11:14,800
- The pod is dying. We must
leave this place at once.

1058
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,795
- Can you boost? I can't even change form.

1059
01:11:17,795 --> 01:11:19,144
- Ditto.

1060
01:11:19,144 --> 01:11:20,360
- It was all the energy I could muster

1061
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,180
to overload the beast.

1062
01:11:22,180 --> 01:11:23,480
I'm as drained as you are.

1063
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:27,140
- There's a twin-ion deep star cruiser

1064
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:28,910
parked just outside the temple.

1065
01:11:28,910 --> 01:11:32,170
If we can make that, I can
get us into the jump ship.

1066
01:11:32,170 --> 01:11:33,490
- Then it's home free.

1067
01:11:33,490 --> 01:11:35,213
- Sounds like a plan. Let's move.

1068
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:40,760
(Dara'Tel screaming and crying)

1069
01:11:42,818 --> 01:11:45,901
(Dara'Tel screaming)

1070
01:11:52,231 --> 01:11:55,185
(soft music)

1071
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:59,320
- [Gab-E] Marion, what's gotten into you?

1072
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,153
- You did this.

1073
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:05,053
You ruined everything.

1074
01:12:06,250 --> 01:12:10,450
It was so beautiful until
you Alterians came along.

1075
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:13,890
- Your god is dead, Marion,
and will soon be buried.

1076
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,520
Will you stay here with your empress,

1077
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:17,173
presiding over a pile of rubble?

1078
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,383
Or will you come with us?

1079
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,193
- I don't know.

1080
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,853
It's all just so confusing.

1081
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,674
(punch striking)

1082
01:12:31,674 --> 01:12:34,257
(laser firing)

1083
01:12:35,831 --> 01:12:39,936
- Okay, let's grab her and
get the hell outta here.

1084
01:12:39,936 --> 01:12:42,853
(ground trembling)

1085
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:50,128
(soft music)

1086
01:12:52,552 --> 01:12:55,302
(engines firing)

1087
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:07,233
- The sun rises again on Thanagar.

1088
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:10,913
- Maybe we'll get another
8,000 years of peace.

1089
01:13:12,390 --> 01:13:13,890
- I wouldn't bet on it, Gab-E.

1090
01:13:14,808 --> 01:13:17,225
(soft music)

1091
01:13:29,115 --> 01:13:31,698
(door opening)

1092
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:38,913
- Well, it was still a
good mission overall.

1093
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:42,170
- We awakened an ancient, godlike evil

1094
01:13:42,170 --> 01:13:44,020
and set it loose in the universe.

1095
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,450
How is that a good mission?

1096
01:13:45,450 --> 01:13:49,740
- We didn't awaken the pod. We exposed it.

1097
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:53,130
We saved the princess, and
we got it all cleared up.

1098
01:13:53,130 --> 01:13:54,490
No harm done.

1099
01:13:54,490 --> 01:13:56,283
- We destroyed an ancient temple.

1100
01:13:57,760 --> 01:14:00,480
- Well sure, but nobody got hurt.

1101
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,616
- Well, Dara did.

1102
01:14:02,616 --> 01:14:05,616
(soft upbeat music)

1103
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,403
Also, I punched Marion.

1104
01:14:13,360 --> 01:14:16,534
And what about that
Jillaxian freighter captain?

1105
01:14:16,534 --> 01:14:18,010
- Oh.

1106
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,640
I forgot about him.

1107
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:23,453
- Hey, let's leave that
out of the report, cool?

1108
01:14:24,450 --> 01:14:26,700
- Cool as the ice moon
on Party Planet Seven.

1109
01:14:27,774 --> 01:14:28,607
- Ch.

1110
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,380
(ship flying)

1111
01:14:40,937 --> 01:14:43,690
- I found a couple stowaways.

1112
01:14:43,690 --> 01:14:47,053
- Dammit, I'm so easy to
sneak up on without my powers.

1113
01:14:47,053 --> 01:14:49,281
I don't see anything coming anymore.

1114
01:14:49,281 --> 01:14:52,600
- What do you say, Captain, to
the jettison hatch with them?

1115
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,750
- Yeah, whatever, those guys are jerks.

1116
01:14:54,750 --> 01:14:57,390
- Wait, Maxy, you still gotta make it

1117
01:14:57,390 --> 01:14:59,320
with a male of the species.

1118
01:14:59,320 --> 01:15:00,153
- Oh yeah.

1119
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:03,903
I was planning on giving that one the sex.

1120
01:15:03,903 --> 01:15:06,603
- Well, you can't jettison
me quite yet then, can you?

1121
01:15:07,809 --> 01:15:08,663
- I suppose not.

1122
01:15:09,650 --> 01:15:13,043
- And we had our fun, the
two of us. Didn't we, Maxy?

1123
01:15:14,020 --> 01:15:16,323
You don't wanna toss old Pim into space.

1124
01:15:18,130 --> 01:15:20,283
- We might harvest data from this one yet.

1125
01:15:21,752 --> 01:15:24,169
(soft music)

1126
01:15:31,560 --> 01:15:34,560
- Oh, Gab-E, someone has to man the ship.

1127
01:15:34,560 --> 01:15:37,014
You're gonna have to sit this one out.

1128
01:15:37,014 --> 01:15:39,431
(soft music)

1129
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,717
- I never get to have any fun.

1130
01:15:47,717 --> 01:15:50,467
(group laughing)

1131
01:15:54,269 --> 01:15:56,769
(light music)

1132
01:16:11,990 --> 01:16:13,960
- Well, since none of
our powers have returned,

1133
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:15,730
we have to do this the old-fashioned way.

1134
01:16:15,730 --> 01:16:18,300
- Yes, it's interesting
that none of my life energy

1135
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:20,924
has returned in any significant way.

1136
01:16:20,924 --> 01:16:23,341
(soft music)

1137
01:16:27,676 --> 01:16:30,562
(door opening)

1138
01:16:30,562 --> 01:16:33,562
(soft upbeat music)

1139
01:16:41,159 --> 01:16:45,720
- Those Alterians sure were
some hot pieces of cosmic ass.

1140
01:16:45,720 --> 01:16:47,550
- Yeah.

1141
01:16:47,550 --> 01:16:48,880
Hey, why do you think they haven't gotten

1142
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,580
their powers back yet?

1143
01:16:50,580 --> 01:16:52,580
- Probably all the pleasure
pods I smuggled aboard

1144
01:16:52,580 --> 01:16:53,900
before we took off.

1145
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:55,853
- All right, I got a bunch too.

1146
01:16:58,063 --> 01:17:01,063
(cupboards shaking)

1147
01:17:05,752 --> 01:17:08,169
(soft music)

1148
01:17:10,517 --> 01:17:13,267
(crowd cheering)

1149
01:17:20,009 --> 01:17:23,009
(soft upbeat music)

1150
01:17:32,687 --> 01:17:35,104
(soft music)

1151
01:17:39,013 --> 01:17:40,930
(upbeat music)

1152
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,860
- Secrets of the natives

1153
01:17:43,810 --> 01:17:44,653
revealed.

1154
01:17:47,200 --> 01:17:49,720
Discover the ancient erotic healing

1155
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,220
of the Thanagarian shamans, shamans.

1156
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:56,030
In the comfort of your own home or office.

1157
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:58,600
Embark on a sensual spirit quest

1158
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:02,253
with the organic and holistic
Thanagarian pleasure pod.

1159
01:18:05,570 --> 01:18:08,093
Quantities are limited and going fast.

1160
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:11,585
Such is the glory of the pod.

1161
01:18:11,585 --> 01:18:14,168
(upbeat music)

1162
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:19,097
Order now.

1163
01:18:19,097 --> 01:18:21,680
(upbeat music)

1164
01:22:11,845 --> 01:22:14,648
- Whoa, ho, let's do that again!

1165
01:22:14,648 --> 01:22:17,231
(upbeat music)

1166
01:22:19,559 --> 01:22:21,809
(laughing)
